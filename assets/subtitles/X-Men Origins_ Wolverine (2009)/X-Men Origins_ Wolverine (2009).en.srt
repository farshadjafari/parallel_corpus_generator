North-west Territories,

00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:01,978
All the time you're sick.

3
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:05,439
And you were sick
when you were my age.

4
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:09,411
Good evening, sir.

5
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,677
Good evening, Victor.
There I realized that you're still here.

6
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:19,396
I keep the ugly of James, sir.
If you do not have anything against ...

7
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:24,274
Very nice of you.

8
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:28,402
- Feeling better, son?
- I'm still cold, dad.

9
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:32,150
It's just a mild fever.
You'll be up tomorrow morning.

10
00:01:32,185 --> 00:01:35,668
- You always say that.
- And you always make it, right?

11
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:40,134
Now... take your medicine.

12
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:42,890
<i>Elizabeth ! </ i></i>

13
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:44,682
<i>Elizabeth ! </ i></i>

14
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:46,621
And got drunk father.

15
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:48,496
You should drive it home, Victor.

16
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:51,143
Not me I shout, sir.

17
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:54,804
- Father!
- Hang in there, James!

18
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:56,750
Father!

19
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:02,052
<i> I told you not to come back here! </ i></i>

20
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:32,591
James ...

21
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,313
There are some things
that you do not understand.

22
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:36,239
- No ...
- You understand!

23
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:38,129
- No ...
- No more lies!

24
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:40,569
James ...

25
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:51,430
No!

26
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:58,757
James!

27
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:07,227
He... was not... your father...

28
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:17,042
...son.

29
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:27,143
What are you?

30
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:44,756
- I wanted!
- Yes!

31
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,930
He deserved it!
And you gave it to him.

32
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:55,679
We're brothers, Jimmy.
You can realise that?

33
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:57,805
Brothers defend each other.

34
00:03:58,432 --> 00:03:59,974
You must now be very hard

35
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:03,054
and can't think you
that nothing can touch us.

36
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:04,850
I want to go home.

37
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:08,247
We can not. We must stay together
whatever happens

38
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:11,388
and let us deal with anyone
that way we can.

39
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:14,199
You can do this, brother?

40
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:22,574
Approaches. You can run?

41
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:28,088
Do not stop.
Do not look behind.

54
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:12,819
My name is Major William Stryker.

55
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:16,245
You were sentenced to death
for decapitating a high-ranking officer.

56
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:18,016
Am I right?

57
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:20,851
Apparently we have some issues
with the authorities...

58
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:23,586
- Control yourself.
- Mr.

59
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:26,475
The director told me

60
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,744
a platoon of execuţie at ten.

61
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:31,975
- How was it?
- A tickle.

62
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,712
Boys, you are tired of fugiţi?

63
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:41,590
You tired of your negaţi

64
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,578
- What do you care ţie?
- I care ...

65
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:49,418
Because I know how special,
preţio and how you are.

66
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:54,479
Listen ...

67
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:58,236

00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:27,462
He's changed this gun

72
00:09:27,498 --> 00:09:29,442
- You want to know why?
- No.

73
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,773
For that is memorable.

74
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,501
Of course, it's bulky,
hardly climbed into a plane

75
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:37,588
but if you go with a few swords
Your wedding at the former friend,

76
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:40,278
no one to never forget.

77
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:44,232
Strange, Wade.
I thought that you like girls.

78
00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:49,292
Of course, probably not
as imposing as a weapon

79
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:52,817
or some claws of bone
nails or a tramp ...

80
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:05,317
- I do manicure?
- Victor ... calm.

81

Fred has a new tattoo.

00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:16,019
- I love it.
- I love you after one night?

84
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:18,774
It's a gymnast.

85
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:21,272
Bradley, land.

87
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:31,082
If we were to fly făcuţi,
we would have grown wings.

88
00:10:31,118 --> 00:10:32,226
Do not you worry, nice,

Be nice.
Or even close.

92
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:41,335
You want a bucket?

93
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,415
Gentlemen, I landed in Lagos
in five minutes.

94
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:51,557
Lagos, Nigeria

95
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:24,143
- Why are we here?
- All in good time. Zero ...

96
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:09,903

- No fun?

97
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:17,442
- Fred ...

98
00:12:17,476 --> 00:12:20,713
- Tank.
- Very good.

99
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:56,960
Super!

100
00:12:57,195 --> 00:13:00,253
Stuck in the elevator with five guys
a diet with more protein.

101
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:01,897
- Wade!
- Even dreams are fulfilled.

102
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:03,975
Shut up! You follow.

103
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:06,019
Thank you, sir.
Arătaţi very well today.

104
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:06,985
Because the color green.

105

We stick evidenţă
seriousness of the eye.

106
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:12,553
- God, you do not shut up at once?
- No. They are not awake.

107
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:16,275
Bradley, on the top floor, please.

108
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:27,027
Go to the elevator!
Elevator!

109
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:38,567
It's time to put me on the job.

110
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:16,413
Ready!

111
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,664
They all died!

112
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:24,368
N If you have a mouth so big,
you were perfect soldier, Wade.

113
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:40,607
Take diamonds, are yours.

114
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:44,350
Do not you want diamonds.
That I want.

115
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:48,480
That? It's nothing. It's a souvenir.

116
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:51,994
Where did you find? Tell me the source.

117
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:58,088
In a small village, far into the
country, three days walk from here.

118
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:03,779
Tell him that this stone is precious
for me than his life.

119
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,114
Ask him where he found it.

120
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:21,018
He said that came from heaven.

121
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,679
Tell the truth.

122
00:15:27,503 --> 00:15:30,845
- Do not you know the language, Logan.
- It's a piece of meteorite.

123
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,676
I know what e.
I wondered where he found.

124
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:36,851
Sir, those at the base
will tie you to where we are.

125
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:38,649
Interrupt communications.

126
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:46,980
Tell everybody you gonna die
if you tell me where he found the stone.

127
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:59,711
- He said that is sacred.
- Okay.

128
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:04,934
Victor ...

129
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:23,213

00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,097
Not for what I came here.

132
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:38,024
Put your hand down.

133
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,879
What are you doing?

134
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:56,037
We go in the end, fine.
Do not spoil everything.

135
00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:59,304
- Enough. I've done enough.
- Who are you?

136
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:01,902
That we do.

137
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:04,444
Preferred to decompose are
in a ravine

138
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:07,378
up-and gave into someone
how to do otherwise?

139
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,355
I have done.

140
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,233
Come with me?

141
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:22,625

145
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:11,096
Muntii Stânco and in Canada,
6 years later

146
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:35,569
Why are you awake so early?

147
00:18:37,835 --> 00:18:39,913
Come here.

148
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:19,826
See you later, sweetie.

149
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:32,096
Very nice! Yes!

150

Springfield, Ohio

151
00:19:57,836 --> 00:19:59,479
No. Come on.

152
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:21,146
You know what to do?

153
00:20:22,913 --> 00:20:25,640
If I succeed stingeţi to light,
tigaţi as a prize.

154
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:28,366
- Cost U.S. dollars a test.
- Come on, I want to try!

155
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,320
Normal.

156
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:43,058
It's the second attempt.

157
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:55,844
- How cheap trick.
- There is a trick, man.

158
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,959
Let's go.

159
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:01,326
Bye!

160
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:31,751
He finished the show!

161
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:39,486
I said that it ended the show!

162
00:21:43,814 --> 00:21:47,145
For us, the show
It never ends, Bradley.

163
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:52,256

- I'm in inviţi?

164
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:56,599
Yes, come.

165
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:14,791
Do you know that I never said
anything to anybody about what happened.

166
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:17,263
Lead a life totally different now, Victor.

167
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:19,496
No need to disturb the past.

168
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,873
You know ...

169
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:41,532
I always thought
Wade you'll beat me to the door.

170
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:47,365
Well, Wade went.

171
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:53,690
I fear you, Victor.

172
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:57,851
I fear death.

173
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:04,038
How do you know?
You never tried it.

174
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,270
You dreamed about wars?

175
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,900
- Which one?
- All.

176
00:23:36,323 --> 00:23:38,824
Tell me ...

177
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:42,324
It's just a scratch.

178
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:52,074
It seems that one and we need to
ternuturi and to us.

179
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:53,826
Yes ...

180
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:20,712
Who the hell is that?

181
00:24:20,748 --> 00:24:22,917
I smell government.

182
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:29,332
God!
You have not even aged a day!

183
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:31,085
I lived clean.

184
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,972
Can you know the agent Zero.

185
00:24:33,008 --> 00:24:35,549
Still chicken questions
after pulling a gun?

186
00:24:37,045 --> 00:24:39,455
You still smoke cheap cigars?

187
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,943
Boys, please.
I have a job for you.

188
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:46,368
- I already have working.
- Lumberman?

189
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,723
- 18 thousand a year?
- 18 thousand and 500.

190
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,965
Plus that I never had
to kill someone for a while.

191
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,183
- I began to miss?
- Now, yes.

192
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:56,073
Zero, back to your car.

193
00:24:58,477 --> 00:25:00,111
Good boy.

194
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:10,039
I'm not proud of the way
how things are over between us.

195
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,949
Conversation that took end.

196
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:17,509
Play of the house in the middle preeriei
together with a teacher

197
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,159
do not you stay in town, Logan.

198
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:22,587
- And you know that?
- Yes.

199
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,339
- What do you want, Stryker?
- Bradley was killed three days ago.

200
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:32,213
Wade even before.

201
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:35,402
I think someone wants to kill
former members of our team.

202
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:38,119
Anybody else?

203
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:40,871
From what I know,
Victor is safe.

204
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:46,837
- Anyone would have names, addresses ...
- Can I wear and own career.

205
00:25:48,896 --> 00:25:51,002
It's not about you, Logan.

206
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,782
Country needs you.

207
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,290
I am Canadian.

208
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:03,441
I know you, Logan! I know who you are!

209
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:43,018
What happened?

210
00:26:44,888 --> 00:26:49,394
A Stryker passed on to me today.
Do not you worry, I refused.

211
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:52,207
Why are you bothering
atâţia after years?

212
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:55,026
Because I'm the best
in what I do.

213
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,092
And not too good
who are working best.

214
00:26:57,126 --> 00:27:00,250
No you're an animal, Logan.
You have a gift.

215
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,262
A gift? He's back.

216
00:27:16,688 --> 00:27:18,463
Come on, boys!

217
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:25,584
- Stay in your car.
- You can ask them nicely.

218
00:27:29,722 --> 00:27:31,964
We want to leave and new
to go beyond?

219
00:27:32,347 --> 00:27:35,258
Your time are you, buddy?

220
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:39,086
- Move you and your car, go to ...
- We want and we can talk, right?

221
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:42,181
If you start something,
Be ready to and finish.

222
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,395
Boys, u ş urel!

223
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:53,427
- Your friend is pretty big mouth.
- I know.

224
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:57,635
It quickly and nettle,
so that leaves us to go, please.

225
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,402
Thanks!

226
00:28:06,403 --> 00:28:07,825
How did it succeed?

227
00:28:08,557 --> 00:28:11,406
You know, the power of persuasion is a gift.

228
00:28:11,638 --> 00:28:15,001
Understand ...
You and this power over me?

229
00:28:15,037 --> 00:28:17,877
You have left in your car, right?

230
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,826
Why is it so lonely months?

231
00:28:37,978 --> 00:28:39,423
Why?

232
00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:42,069
Because I have a boyfriend.

233
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:44,481
- You say that and children?
- No.

234
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,894
His name was Kuekuatsheu
and the spirits living in the world together.

235
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:50,968
So a true story ...

236
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:55,356
And every night,
walk in the sky together.

237
00:28:56,045 --> 00:29:00,440
But one of the spirits
was jealous.

238
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:04,104
Trickster (Ş mecherul) wanted Month
only for him.

239
00:29:04,138 --> 00:29:08,192
so that he told his Kuekuatsheu
Luna asked that flowers.

240
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:12,301
I was told to come into our world
I like to collect some dogberry,

241
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,421
Kuekuatsheu but not people
I once left the world spirits,

242
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:20,002
not be able to return.

243
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:26,236
Every night, looking to heaven
and sees the moon and they scream your name.

244
00:29:29,615 --> 00:29:35,817
But it can never achieve.

245
00:29:38,115 --> 00:29:40,854
Koo-koo-choose was diddled.

246
00:29:42,185 --> 00:29:44,241
Kuekuatsheu.

247
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:54,307
Means Wolverine (Bursuc).

248
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:55,722
How are you, Logan?

249
00:31:50,713 --> 00:31:52,570
Kayla!

250
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:58,758
You're not from the area, is it?

251
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:05,452
What gave me away?

252
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:13,161
- You insurance locally?
- Insurance?

253
00:33:13,804 --> 00:33:15,593
No.

254
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,382
Too bad.

255
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:35,962
Well, well, well ...
Look what the cat brought.

256
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:39,356
Boys, whatever it is,
Take yourself out.

257
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:54,115
- Why?
- Why?

258
00:33:58,451 --> 00:34:06,159
Do not call, I write ...
How else to capture your attention?

259
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:49,443
I hate to say, James,
but, frankly, are a little disappointed.

260
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,643
Stay down.

261
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:35,311
Tell me, Jimmy, was worth it?

262
00:35:55,639 --> 00:36:01,313
When you give your account
that we are not like them?

263
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:11,393
- I am not like you.
- Yes. I just do not know yet.

264
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,461
- What do we have?
- A fight in the bar.

265
00:36:27,496 --> 00:36:29,480
Has several wounds by knife.

266
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:33,306
What is this a joke?
The guy has nothing.

267
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,914
Where is he?

268
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:36,114
I asked where he is!

269
00:36:36,148 --> 00:36:37,664
I do not know who e.

270
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:39,179
I can help you.

271
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:48,606
For six years stay.
I know nobody's tea, then you have come!

272
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:52,324
- The next day, he died!
- I tried to warn you.

273
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:55,322
- Why do not you told me is that Victor?
- I and tiut!

274
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:01,813
I swear on my life son!

275
00:37:09,972 --> 00:37:12,563
Victor's appetite has become
too strong.

276
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,989
I was forced to close.
He thought that I have betrayed.

277
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:20,315
He left without authorized
and said that one to come after us all.

278
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:24,052
You have come to warn me that.
You came to save your skin.

279
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:26,902
What you plan, captain?

280
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:29,018
You can not defeat it, Logan.
You know well that you can not.

281
00:37:29,052 --> 00:37:30,753
I find him and he will die.

282
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,692
I can provide the means to kill.

283
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:44,034
- Yet it can save others.
- As you însuţi, right?

284
00:37:45,114 --> 00:37:47,264
Q and promise two things.

285
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,469
A to suporţi more pain
than any human can endure,

286
00:37:50,503 --> 00:37:53,036
but to avenge you.

287
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:59,164
If you come with you, I want blood.

288
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:03,306
Without law, without honor.

289
00:38:03,706 --> 00:38:07,784
Told me about the correct direction
and ride the hell out of my way.

290
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:49,523
When you begin the process,

291
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:52,210
any reason
for doing this,

292
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,402
focus back to this
maybe you can be helpful.

293
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:58,074
Believe me, I went
the situation worse.

294
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,559
I think not.

295
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:01,929
We are ready.

296
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:09,106
Oh you do not indestructible,
But first, you must destroy.

297
00:39:12,077 --> 00:39:16,630
- May ţii mind find in Africa?
- Yes.

298
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:23,927
I have found. He helped to create
a metal alloy as strong,

299
00:39:23,963 --> 00:39:26,945
that practically
you can bear anything.

300
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,672
Is called adamantiu.

301
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:33,710
I can not stop Victor
alone, Logan.

302
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:39,322
To kill him,
will have to choose the other,

303
00:39:40,853 --> 00:39:43,047
animal to become ...

304
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:46,467
Go to start.

305
00:39:47,213 --> 00:39:48,603
I almost forgot.

306
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:53,971
I want more.

307
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,184
What do you write them?

308
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,480
Wolverine.

309
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,653
Dlor General, welcome.

310
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:21,697
Mr Munson.

311
00:40:22,775 --> 00:40:25,914
Today, you will witness
a piece of medical history.

312
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,447
- Today, we will create weapon X.
- X?

313
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,664
From Roman numeral 10.

314
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:39,150
We are about to lipim adamantiu
skeleton of X. Arms

315
00:40:39,496 --> 00:40:41,188
Let's start.

316
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:29,768
<i> - We fraţi, Jimmy.
- Logan! </ I></i>

317
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:32,318
Body temperature is 42 degrees
and grow in the future.

318
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,097
Why do you?
Why not sedated?

319
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:41,701
Feel the pain as all the world
anestezicul but has no effect on him.

320
00:41:41,735 --> 00:41:43,525
Of these had
to volunteer.

321
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:45,617
195.

322
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,586
- A to supravieţuiască?
- I do not know.

323
00:41:47,621 --> 00:41:49,250
200.

324
00:41:51,461 --> 00:41:52,773
<i> ... son. </ i></i>

325
00:41:54,105 --> 00:41:55,822
Heart rhythm is close to maximum.

326
00:41:55,858 --> 00:41:58,244
- Voltage?
- 260 180.

327
00:41:58,278 --> 00:42:00,172
A ească to succeed.

328
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:06,829
<i>Victor ! </ i></i>

329
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,003
<i> I love you. </ i></i>

330
00:42:14,038 --> 00:42:16,114
<i> No you're an animal, Logan. </ i></i>

331
00:42:21,826 --> 00:42:23,692
<i>Bursuc  means. </ i></i>

332
00:42:50,414 --> 00:42:52,601
Seems that may die.

333
00:43:24,503 --> 00:43:27,172
Come on, buddy. Snap.

334
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:31,690
Heart rhythm grow up.

335
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,782
Adamantiu tank is empty.

336
00:43:35,376 --> 00:43:38,422
It was rejected.
The procedure is complete.

337
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:39,831
I succeed in it!

338
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:41,556
Yes!

339
00:43:47,644 --> 00:43:49,708
To take him on island?

340
00:43:50,052 --> 00:43:52,737
On the island? No.

341
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:58,512
Soldering work.
One can use the DNA to XI.

342
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:02,836
I delete them memories.

343
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,931
"Prăjiţi 's brain!

344
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:18,980
I think you heard.

345
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,389
Close the room!

346
00:45:13,016 --> 00:45:16,503
Search him and take his head.

347
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,436
Travis!

348
00:46:06,717 --> 00:46:11,284
I think we have a naked man in the barn.

349
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:45,981
Boys ...

350
00:46:46,434 --> 00:46:48,003
What are you doing?

351
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:51,728
- It's cold.
- Cold?

352
00:46:54,990 --> 00:47:00,351
- You are naked.
- I know.

353
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:03,981
- You take drugs, right?
- No.

354
00:47:04,853 --> 00:47:08,961
- You had a busy night.
- It may be said, and you a.

355
00:47:11,344 --> 00:47:13,056
Come on home.

356
00:47:13,503 --> 00:47:16,597
Likely to suit you
some of the clothes of my son.

357
00:47:17,449 --> 00:47:19,909
Here, cover yourself with it.

358
00:47:20,278 --> 00:47:23,295
I do not want to cause them to Mrs.
a heart attack.

359
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,534
You are okay?

360
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,074
Everything is fine.

361
00:48:13,552 --> 00:48:17,335
- I had dinner.
- Coming soon.

362
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,367
I swear I'll pay for it.

363
00:48:32,778 --> 00:48:34,978
Put it down there.

364
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:41,802
Come and sit down, boy.

365
00:48:47,733 --> 00:48:50,668
I can not thank you enough.

366
00:48:50,702 --> 00:48:53,536
It would have been decent
I can not let there frozen.

367
00:48:53,985 --> 00:48:56,880
- Decent ...
- What?

368
00:48:57,231 --> 00:49:01,016
Nothing, just that there are too common and nuit
with this word.

369
00:49:03,789 --> 00:49:06,963
- Nice bike you have.
- You know?

370
00:49:06,998 --> 00:49:08,547
God, and begin.

371
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:09,936
My favorite
Harley Davidson Panhead is 48.

372
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:11,230
I had a new nouţă.

373
00:49:11,231 --> 00:49:13,974
I think you're a little young
for such a thing.

374
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:17,206
You must be exhausted.
Do you rest you tonight.

375
00:49:17,242 --> 00:49:19,086
In the barn.

376
00:49:19,815 --> 00:49:22,175
There can not hurt anything.

377
00:49:35,498 --> 00:49:36,969
<i> I love you. </ i></i>

378
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:40,954
<i> - Why is it so lonely months?
- Why </ i></i>

379
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:45,112
<i> Because I have a boyfriend. </ i></i>

380
00:49:47,121 --> 00:49:49,822
<i> But it can never achieve. </ i></i>

381
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:14,190
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

382
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:19,958
There seem to be
a man put on misdoings.

383
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:25,202
You know what happens
a man who wants blood?

384
00:50:25,507 --> 00:50:29,367
- What?
- I found you.

385
00:50:31,847 --> 00:50:35,726
- With all we have a choice, boy.
- I no longer am.

386
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,695
Nonsense.

387
00:50:41,463 --> 00:50:43,739
This jacket was my boy.

388
00:50:45,713 --> 00:50:47,288
Prove it.

389
00:51:02,943 --> 00:51:06,768
- Thanks.
- Yes ...

390
00:51:07,543 --> 00:51:12,253
You can take my bike on a ride,
to test the matter.

391
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,608
About'64 ...

392
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,668
- Heavy's are.
- I put something on me recently.

393
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:23,342
Good morning!

394
00:51:27,581 --> 00:51:29,347
I came perfect!

395
00:51:31,045 --> 00:51:32,202
I brought you some ...

396
00:51:41,255 --> 00:51:43,992
<i>Gun  X is in the barn.
I just killed two civilians. </ I></i>

397
00:51:44,027 --> 00:51:47,298
Bombardaţi it, let's see
if you survive.

398
00:51:59,878 --> 00:52:01,494
<i> Fire at will! </ i></i>

399
00:52:10,576 --> 00:52:11,842
Come after me!

400
00:52:25,115 --> 00:52:26,525
Let them fly brains!

401
00:52:26,938 --> 00:52:28,173
Damn!

402
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:06,293
1 alpha, not lose it!

403
00:53:14,592 --> 00:53:16,827
<i>Alfa  2, comes to you! </ i></i>

404
00:54:07,862 --> 00:54:09,188
<i> Up! </ i></i>

405
00:55:10,047 --> 00:55:11,572
<i> Zero! </ i></i>

406
00:55:13,635 --> 00:55:15,572
<i> Zero, Logan is dead </ i></i>

407
00:55:20,295 --> 00:55:22,061
<i> Zero, answer!</i>

408
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,929
<i>L  have it?</i>

409
00:55:25,965 --> 00:55:27,998
No, I was smitten.

410
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,376
<i> Zero, answer!</i>

411
00:55:36,717 --> 00:55:38,518
<i> You tried to kill me?</i>

412
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:40,043
Logan?

413
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,331
Where is Victor?

414
00:55:41,365 --> 00:55:43,268
Go back to base.

415
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:45,360
I can explain everything to you
and you catch Victor together.

416
00:55:45,396 --> 00:55:46,989
<i>Answer  gre ş it.</i>

417
00:55:47,025 --> 00:55:49,726
After you kill Victor,
Friday after you.

418
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,500
<i> Logan, listen to me.</i>

419
00:55:54,534 --> 00:55:57,054
If you go down this road,
is not possible you'll like what you found.

420
00:55:58,244 --> 00:56:02,427
You wanted an animal, Colonel ...
Now you got.

421
00:56:06,851 --> 00:56:09,527
Those were good people.

422
00:56:09,775 --> 00:56:11,885
People nevinovaţi.

423
00:56:17,728 --> 00:56:21,574
Funny how people nevinovaţi
the tendency to die around you.

424
00:56:45,885 --> 00:56:48,335
Zero never had any chance you.

425
00:56:48,722 --> 00:56:52,182
The only thing that can beat him
is a glonţ of adamantiu.

426
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,476
Facility is compromised.
Prepares the shipment.

427
00:57:11,635 --> 00:57:14,134
Colonel, the situation started
to turn into a disaster.

428
00:57:14,168 --> 00:57:16,148
- You do not worry, it'll stop.
- Really?

429
00:57:16,184 --> 00:57:19,748
I just spent half a billion
of dollars to get him indestructible.

430
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:24,072
- Sir?
- Yes.

431
00:57:24,106 --> 00:57:27,208
Young mutant you look ...
I have found.

432
00:57:27,688 --> 00:57:30,342
General Logan is the only missing piece
of the puzzle.

433
00:57:30,378 --> 00:57:34,353
Must evacuate the building.
Please, please întorceţi Washington.

434
00:57:34,563 --> 00:57:35,929
We have work to do.

435
00:57:38,548 --> 00:57:42,235
I talk, you talk you, he?

436
00:57:42,271 --> 00:57:43,927
We translate anyone?

437
00:57:44,146 --> 00:57:46,141
Summers?

438
00:57:46,175 --> 00:57:48,793
Stand up and let down your glasses.

439
00:57:49,972 --> 00:57:52,206
My head hurts.

440
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:54,431
Then you can segment them in detention,

441
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:57,338
after hours
when you conjugate a verb 100 times.

442
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:58,844
Anyone else?

443
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,282
He speaks up.

444
00:58:00,317 --> 00:58:02,384
Very good.
He speaks up.

445
00:58:13,853 --> 00:58:16,150
- Sure was Victor?
- Yes.

446
00:58:17,139 --> 00:58:19,418
Damn!

447
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,496
I'm sorry, man.

448
00:58:23,853 --> 00:58:26,251
What the hell happened to him
after you've left me?

449
00:58:26,286 --> 00:58:27,898
It was hopeless.

450
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:29,514
He thought that you abandoned.

451
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:31,431
I thought all this.

452
00:58:31,465 --> 00:58:35,246
But Victor wanted to demonstrate
that was better than you.

453
00:58:35,282 --> 00:58:38,061
He began to hunt and to kill
everything's out in her way.

454
00:58:38,364 --> 00:58:42,454
I renunţat and I after a few months.
I supported them to gather.

455
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:46,251
- Who to pick?
- Let a and a.

456
00:58:46,286 --> 00:58:48,264
Who to pick, John?

457
00:58:48,882 --> 00:58:50,885
Damn, John!

458
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,286
I hunted those like us, Logan.

459
00:58:53,503 --> 00:58:56,070
We have a place reserved in hell
for the things I did in November.

460
00:58:56,106 --> 00:58:57,673
Mutanţi?

461
00:58:57,972 --> 00:58:59,784
Why?

462
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:02,581
Stryker says
that we can make a difference.

463
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:05,643
That protect people from the bad.

464
00:59:13,505 --> 00:59:16,010
How it răpui Victor, Logan?

465
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:20,152
- May ţii remember that thing in Africa?
- I remember Africa, what about her?

466
00:59:24,382 --> 00:59:25,632
Vai de mine!

467
00:59:27,088 --> 00:59:28,663
What have you done?

468
00:59:29,297 --> 00:59:30,679
Do not ask.

469
00:59:33,291 --> 00:59:36,635
Zero said something to an island.
I know something about this?

470
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:37,724
No.

471
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,369
But you can tie Dukes.

472
00:59:39,403 --> 00:59:41,496
- They were two good friends.
- Fred Dukes?

473
00:59:41,532 --> 00:59:42,840
- Where is it?
- It's here.

474
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:44,826
- Come to talk with him.
- Hold you a.

475
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,742
He never passed the fourth round.

476
00:59:46,777 --> 00:59:50,016
Must warn you,
developed a food problem.

477
00:59:50,052 --> 00:59:53,704
All have mechanisms for adaptation.
Trying to bring back him in shape.

478
00:59:53,739 --> 00:59:57,358
Come on, if you want to get in shape,
you must move it.

479
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:58,550
I told you that I do not move it.

480
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,420
Fred Dukes? I think the thing is
he ate Fred.

481
01:00:06,454 --> 01:00:09,001
Whatever you do,
not tell anything about weight.

482
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:12,280
Hey, Fat, that is, Fred.

483
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,820
I see that you remember that girl
when was 50 kg.

484
01:00:17,985 --> 01:00:22,382
- How funny are you, Logan.
- I know where is Victor?

485
01:00:23,757 --> 01:00:24,753
I have no idea.

486
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,956
What island slăbuţule?

487
01:00:28,873 --> 01:00:31,150
Take care not to hit the door
you go, Logan.

488
01:00:31,478 --> 01:00:36,563
Come on, umblatule tell me where is Victor.
For old times' sake.

489
01:00:37,793 --> 01:00:42,079
Have you done any inflated?

490
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,893
No!

491
01:00:50,704 --> 01:00:52,259
I told you I
I can not say anything about weight.

492
01:00:52,293 --> 01:00:53,552
Why did you bloated?

493
01:00:53,588 --> 01:00:55,967
I said bloated, I have been told.

494
01:00:56,003 --> 01:00:57,753
Goddamn it!

495
01:00:58,211 --> 01:00:59,557
I have an idea.

496
01:01:01,253 --> 01:01:03,659
- That you think that's a good idea?
- Trying to help you, Logan.

497
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,625
Dukes does not like you too,
and you know it.

498
01:01:05,659 --> 01:01:06,851
The feeling is mutual.

499
01:01:06,885 --> 01:01:09,358
Use the manu and parties,
a little dance with him.

500
01:01:09,393 --> 01:01:11,543
Let him free-and rage.

501
01:01:12,106 --> 01:01:14,925
I think that if it and make it
you'll say all I want you to know.

502
01:01:15,168 --> 01:01:16,967
Look and you to him.

503
01:01:17,003 --> 01:01:19,487
I can see the bottom of the shirt front.

504
01:01:19,748 --> 01:01:22,393
Jesus, like he ate
a cornfield maize.

505
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:25,052
Have a fair enough
order to remove him from here?

506
01:01:26,898 --> 01:01:29,079
Do not you worry
stretcher for him.

507
01:01:29,284 --> 01:01:30,581
You are a bastard.

508
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:34,737
Knock it mar!

509
01:01:34,739 --> 01:01:36,911
I let him give.

510
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:40,268
What would you be?
Want to dance with me?

511
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:42,168
What's good

512
01:01:46,112 --> 01:01:47,987
Both? No longer can?

513
01:01:49,112 --> 01:01:51,670
Now we can talk,
brought him exactly where I wanted.

514
01:01:51,706 --> 01:01:53,235
You whose side are you?

515
01:02:29,054 --> 01:02:30,481
Now, where is Victor?

516
01:03:01,463 --> 01:03:04,036
It's pretty dark for sunglasses,
do not you think?

517
01:03:19,786 --> 01:03:22,661
Please do not kill me!

518
01:03:22,697 --> 01:03:24,333
Victor!

519
01:03:28,974 --> 01:03:30,628
Where's Victor?

520
01:03:33,128 --> 01:03:39,380
Victor is on the island with Stryker,
do this together.

521
01:03:41,688 --> 01:03:42,525
What?

522
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,567
Victor walk with Stryker?

523
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:46,030
Yes.

524
01:03:46,358 --> 01:03:47,800
Tiai not it?

525
01:04:08,568 --> 01:04:10,643
Now no longer remained
than Logan.

526
01:04:10,644 --> 01:04:13,755
I think you're in
up to him.

527
01:04:14,244 --> 01:04:16,190
I got busy and before, right?

528
01:04:16,226 --> 01:04:18,568
Yes, you e.

529
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:25,539
Understanding our
is still valid, right?

530
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,034
Of course.

531
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:30,699
Now pack it
and numbered it, Captain.

532
01:04:38,869 --> 01:04:40,978
What is this island?

533
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:46,070
Place where it leads Stryker
after I catch Victor.

534
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:49,478
Who leads?

535
01:04:50,539 --> 01:04:52,418
On mutanţi.

536
01:04:52,813 --> 01:04:57,579
It is said that Stryker
do experiments on them.

537
01:04:59,827 --> 01:05:02,217
You have never asked
what happened to them?

538
01:05:02,253 --> 01:05:04,550
I tried not to do that.

539
01:05:20,378 --> 01:05:25,128
They killed her
I like to let you get adamantiu me.

540
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,755
They killed her for an experiment.

541
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:35,865
Where is it?

542
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,769
Logan, Stryker keep secret place.

543
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,929
But ...

544
01:05:45,568 --> 01:05:48,117
- A prisoner escaped from there sometime.
- Who?

545
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:50,327
His name is Remy LeBeau.

546
01:05:50,362 --> 01:05:52,467
A crook in New Orleans.

547
01:05:52,501 --> 01:05:57,161
The guards there said they Gambia,
because they always take the money from poker.

548
01:05:57,195 --> 01:05:59,653
What Stryker wants to achieve?

549
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:06,315
To take power,
attempts to combine them somehow.

550
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:09,059
It's all I know, Logan.

551
01:06:10,396 --> 01:06:13,460
If you need to get back here
a tai to your head.

552
01:06:17,731 --> 01:06:19,257
Come with you, Logan.

553
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:23,797
- I found your salvation where I go.
- Not asking that.

554
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:03,275
He's our man.

555
01:07:09,864 --> 01:07:11,498
It's tough.

556
01:07:11,943 --> 01:07:15,217
- I'm going back, if that runs.
- Do not fight with anyone.

557
01:07:15,574 --> 01:07:17,143
- How not to.
- What?

558
01:07:17,177 --> 01:07:18,585
I think that fight everyone?

559
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:20,675
Dogs do not kill cats?

560
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:22,730
Get back soon.

561
01:07:35,121 --> 01:07:37,981
You are Remy LeBeau?

562
01:07:39,231 --> 01:07:40,831
I owe money?

563
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:42,315
No.

564
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:45,449
Where are Remy LeBeau.

565
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:06,740
Big blind is 100,
and the low is 50.

566
01:08:07,646 --> 01:08:09,534
Take a hand?

567
01:08:09,568 --> 01:08:11,818
I get the $ 17?

568
01:08:12,773 --> 01:08:14,724
$ 17?

569
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,453
A way home by taxi, maybe.

570
01:08:22,046 --> 01:08:24,421
You are a new babysitter to my brother, John?

571
01:08:25,694 --> 01:08:27,458
I do not like Bradley, Victor.

572
01:08:27,493 --> 01:08:29,353
And people in black clothes
not scare me.

573
01:08:29,387 --> 01:08:30,841
Really?

574
01:08:31,216 --> 01:08:32,636
It worked with Dukes.

575
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:36,801
Too bad, because now you can kill you.
Logan never to have a chance.

576
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:40,621
And what you get
in our beautiful town, sir?

577
01:08:40,655 --> 01:08:42,680
Victor Creed.

578
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,060
And who is he?

579
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:49,033
The man that can kill.

580
01:08:50,404 --> 01:08:53,715
Working for a man
named Stryker, an island.

581
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,064
- Need to know just where e.
- What makes you think you know that?

582
01:08:58,331 --> 01:09:01,100
Because I know who you are, Gambia.

583
01:09:02,192 --> 01:09:06,421
You are the one who escaped
and the right to take me there.

584
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,092
You know, John ...

585
01:09:10,127 --> 01:09:12,188
I always wanted to tell you something.

586
01:09:17,641 --> 01:09:20,097
You are predictable.

587
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:26,472
I feel column Johnny.

588
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:30,323
How odd.
I do not think you knew one.

589
01:09:33,529 --> 01:09:37,354
What you tăbliţe beautiful neck.

590
01:09:38,381 --> 01:09:41,560
They did some one thousand and the same.

591
01:09:45,042 --> 01:09:47,113
LeBeau, listen to me ...

592
01:10:20,614 --> 01:10:24,502
Two years I was in that hole,
and you never go back.

593
01:10:27,268 --> 01:10:29,849
What are glossy.

594
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:34,646
Tell me, Jimmy.

595
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,694
Even you know how to kill me?

596
01:10:37,729 --> 01:10:40,319
A tai to your head.

597
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,163
Let's see if it works.

598
01:10:52,841 --> 01:10:54,494
Become ungainly, old man.

599
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,264
Motherfucker ...

600
01:11:09,824 --> 01:11:12,378
O to die
what did you do it.

601
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:38,042
Victor!

602
01:11:47,667 --> 01:11:49,725
What băţ beautiful.

603
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,740
Look how to work.

604
01:12:50,956 --> 01:12:53,256
I'm going to the island,
where you can kill

605
01:12:53,257 --> 01:12:56,057
the Creed, Stryker
and all that kind of hatred you are on this world.

606
01:12:56,302 --> 01:12:57,948
Understand?

607
01:12:59,345 --> 01:13:00,740
You want to kill.

608
01:13:00,775 --> 01:13:03,175
As long as I stand in the way, yes.

609
01:13:17,412 --> 01:13:18,555
Colonel.

610
01:13:19,712 --> 01:13:20,760
General?

611
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,274
That weapon is XI?

612
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:27,676
All their powers,
but none of weakness.

613
01:13:27,712 --> 01:13:29,782
Even hate you, not to you?

614
01:13:30,127 --> 01:13:32,002
Do not hate him.

615
01:13:32,037 --> 01:13:35,493
After 20 years of work,
I realize what they are capable.

616
01:13:40,152 --> 01:13:44,226
As the war tigăm before you begin,
will save many vieţi.

617
01:13:44,261 --> 01:13:47,372
Preventive action is the only action.

618
01:13:47,936 --> 01:13:52,055
General, the days on which our country
looked at the edge of the past.

619
01:13:52,677 --> 01:13:56,246
Must take the fight to the enemy
before it to bring us.

620
01:13:56,796 --> 01:13:59,699
- I admire your passion.
- Thanks.

621
01:14:00,463 --> 01:14:03,275
But we stop here.

622
01:14:03,622 --> 01:14:05,832
But Gun X was a small eală the gre ...

623
01:14:05,867 --> 01:14:07,707
We know your son, Bill.

624
01:14:07,742 --> 01:14:09,512
We know that is a mutant.

625
01:14:09,547 --> 01:14:12,735
We know that you killed wife,
We should not hide it.

626
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:14,301
This ...

627
01:14:15,997 --> 01:14:18,943
- This has no connection with my work.
- Nonsense!

628
01:14:19,453 --> 01:14:22,654
You are too close to it.
I am sure that you know.

629
01:14:25,046 --> 01:14:28,520
You are right.
Do not you lie.

630
01:14:31,488 --> 01:14:36,492
My son brought me this.

631
01:14:36,881 --> 01:14:39,470
But I took an oath,

632
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:43,016
to protect citizens of this country

633
01:14:43,314 --> 01:14:45,502
any threats

634
01:14:45,706 --> 01:14:47,458
both foreign ...

635
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,103
... as well as internal.

636
01:15:04,009 --> 01:15:06,052
- Not much I like to fly.
- Okay.

637
01:15:06,087 --> 01:15:09,243
- Concentrate to your job.
- I can see you sweating a lot.

638
01:15:09,278 --> 01:15:12,337
- Very funny. Watch the ...
- What? In the clouds?

639
01:15:12,619 --> 01:15:15,814
Like a broken disk.
Where did you get this shit?

640
01:15:16,015 --> 01:15:18,462
She is darling.
I like tigat it to a game.

641
01:15:18,497 --> 01:15:21,565
- A handful of valeţi with fives.
- Super ...

642
01:15:22,753 --> 01:15:25,221
Line up the back.
Almost there.

643
01:15:26,841 --> 01:15:28,443
Here it is.

644
01:15:28,478 --> 01:15:30,045
Island.

645
01:15:30,296 --> 01:15:33,801
An island of 5 kilometers
hidden from view.

646
01:15:36,819 --> 01:15:39,481
Nobody wants to come
a nuclear reactor.

647
01:15:39,483 --> 01:15:41,975
People think
I'll turn in my tri's.

648
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:43,253
I like you?

649
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:44,957
Yes ...

650
01:15:46,425 --> 01:15:48,206
Okay, are you ready?

651
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,817
Now or never.
Come on.

652
01:15:49,851 --> 01:15:51,177
And it was time.

653
01:16:00,386 --> 01:16:03,520
If you are you can do better,
you know that you'll hurt.

654
01:16:03,555 --> 01:16:07,132
Yes, I feel better.

655
01:16:07,761 --> 01:16:09,134
Cheers!

656
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:11,293
And ţie.

657
01:16:13,072 --> 01:16:14,561
Shit!

658
01:16:21,498 --> 01:16:22,667
What do?

659
01:16:23,213 --> 01:16:24,667
Is everything okay?

660
01:16:25,699 --> 01:16:28,109
- How long takes?
- A few hours.

661
01:16:28,466 --> 01:16:30,599
A to respond to my commands?

662
01:16:30,634 --> 01:16:32,565
Yes, Colonel.

663
01:17:35,087 --> 01:17:36,256
Logan.

664
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:39,368
Welcome back to war.

665
01:17:40,733 --> 01:17:44,085
Before you tai,
I want to know why.

666
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:47,649
I need your powers
for Pool.

667
01:17:47,684 --> 01:17:49,398
What?

668
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:52,688
Devil and the mutant.
Deadpool.

669
01:17:53,511 --> 01:17:57,304
Years of research, to find
appropriate powers

670
01:17:57,338 --> 01:18:02,042
that may exist together in the same body
not to destroy it.

671
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:07,021
My son was the first piece of the puzzle.

672
01:18:07,809 --> 01:18:09,815
Logan, you are last.

673
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,497
You are the weapon XI.

674
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:20,572
You asked I would help,
but you wanted a life lines and Tita.

675
01:18:22,738 --> 01:18:28,894
I understand that nothing motivates him more
those of your family as revenge.

676
01:18:45,146 --> 01:18:46,895
Who are you?

677
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,224
It's an old friend.

678
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,538
You do not think
that we let you go I a. ..

679
01:19:05,573 --> 01:19:07,608
You are a dangerous man.

680
01:19:07,823 --> 01:19:10,511
I like watching them
people periculo and i.

681
01:19:10,762 --> 01:19:12,911
Tell him about
they were dead.

682
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,237
He did an injection
hydrochloride with thiazides.

683
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:28,123
I reduced so much fighting heart,
that makes you look dead.

684
01:19:39,868 --> 01:19:42,393
Do not be mad at her.

685
01:19:42,927 --> 01:19:46,298
It has done you proud species.

686
01:19:48,962 --> 01:19:53,082
I know that her sister
are the diamond-hard skin?

687
01:19:53,118 --> 01:19:56,677
Kayla power is based more
the tacto-hypnosis.

688
01:19:56,712 --> 01:19:59,725
Can influence people
only if they touch.

689
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:02,479
A useful tool
seducţiei al.

690
01:20:02,693 --> 01:20:05,322
There was never really my friend.

691
01:20:10,051 --> 01:20:12,287
For me, it was true.

692
01:20:14,068 --> 01:20:17,340
I tell you that if you go down this road,
I'll you'll like what you found.

693
01:20:24,796 --> 01:20:26,930
Story that
I told her,

694
01:20:26,931 --> 01:20:30,375
about man
that collected for the month of flowers ...

695
01:20:31,524 --> 01:20:34,476
I understood a gre ş it.

696
01:20:36,484 --> 01:20:40,051
I think you are the moon,
Bursuc and I am yours.

697
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:45,463
But you were Trickster, not to you?

698
01:20:45,685 --> 01:20:48,238
I am the only fool trick.

699
01:20:50,173 --> 01:20:53,721
The worst is
that I had to be realized.

700
01:20:56,278 --> 01:20:58,890
I knew in my instincts ...

701
01:21:01,814 --> 01:21:04,828
I knew what really.

702
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:12,001
There'll never happen.

703
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,136
- Colonel.
- Not now, Kayla.

704
01:21:45,171 --> 01:21:47,952
I did everything you asked for.

705
01:21:49,113 --> 01:21:51,114
My sister ...

706
01:21:51,643 --> 01:21:54,408
You said that if you help
'll give him away.

707
01:21:54,628 --> 01:21:56,563
Not really so simple.

708
01:21:56,597 --> 01:21:59,546
Move is unique.
It's a beauty.

709
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:01,752
We need more time just
to analyze, so everything.

710
01:22:01,787 --> 01:22:03,845
You let him go?

711
01:22:06,695 --> 01:22:09,114
- Victor, please.
- You can not to it, and go.

712
01:22:09,149 --> 01:22:11,597
- I can win.
- Give me adamantiul.

713
01:22:11,632 --> 01:22:13,461
- Tests have ...
- I had an understanding.

714
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:15,289
I'll survive and your operation.

715
01:22:17,582 --> 01:22:20,661
- Can any support and he can.
- I can not.

716
01:22:21,831 --> 01:22:25,677
You are my favorite soldier, Victor.
Be patient, one to come and the time ta.

717
01:22:25,712 --> 01:22:27,876
It uses the new.

718
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,159
What would you die for real
this time?

719
01:22:40,895 --> 01:22:42,140
Let me go.

720
01:22:44,978 --> 01:22:47,412
You have and effect on me.

721
01:22:47,824 --> 01:22:49,042
Victor!

722
01:23:23,283 --> 01:23:25,297
Are you well, not to you?

723
01:23:26,519 --> 01:23:28,658
All that anger ...

724
01:23:29,904 --> 01:23:31,493
Do it.

725
01:23:31,528 --> 01:23:33,082
Logan!

726
01:23:34,177 --> 01:23:36,546
No you're an animal.

727
01:23:36,582 --> 01:23:38,328
Yes you are.

728
01:23:41,813 --> 01:23:43,018
Do it.

729
01:23:47,041 --> 01:23:49,208
Ends.

730
01:24:13,166 --> 01:24:14,664
Logan?

731
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,573
My sister ...

732
01:24:19,784 --> 01:24:21,971
I have my sister.

733
01:24:22,371 --> 01:24:26,420
Please don 't fool
so I love you.

734
01:24:26,454 --> 01:24:29,225
And for me it was true.

735
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:32,592
Please ...
I'm sorry.

736
01:24:32,627 --> 01:24:35,176
I have my sister.

737
01:24:35,609 --> 01:24:37,207
Where is it?

738
01:24:42,427 --> 01:24:45,488
- Activate Gun XI.
- The binding is not complete.

739
01:24:45,524 --> 01:24:46,484
Do it!

740
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,445
Now!

741
01:25:49,162 --> 01:25:50,871
You are okay? Come on.

742
01:26:41,158 --> 01:26:42,472
Well ...

743
01:26:43,211 --> 01:26:44,509
Perfect.

744
01:26:44,801 --> 01:26:46,728
- Kayla, get the kids here.
- Logan ...

745
01:26:46,762 --> 01:26:48,726
Find the other exit.

746
01:26:48,761 --> 01:26:50,692
Haideţi. Let's go!

747
01:26:51,722 --> 01:26:53,722
Wade, you are?

748
01:26:57,363 --> 01:27:00,587
Stryker has finally found it in a way
you do not shut up.

749
01:27:11,345 --> 01:27:12,717
Wade ...

750
01:27:13,671 --> 01:27:15,176
Should not do that.

751
01:27:16,612 --> 01:27:17,865
Or maybe you should.

752
01:27:33,063 --> 01:27:34,310
Fire at will!

753
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:43,891
Can you help.
Take me closer.

754
01:27:44,206 --> 01:27:45,144
Go!

755
01:27:53,706 --> 01:27:54,818
Go! Now!

756
01:28:01,605 --> 01:28:03,176
I got you?

757
01:28:03,212 --> 01:28:04,364
Yes.

758
01:28:14,273 --> 01:28:15,806
- Come on.
- I can not come.

759
01:28:15,841 --> 01:28:17,074
Kayla, come on!

760
01:28:17,109 --> 01:28:18,729
You must remain here.

761
01:28:18,765 --> 01:28:20,664
You go with them.

762
01:28:21,185 --> 01:28:22,538
Go!

763
01:28:53,037 --> 01:28:54,548
Left.

764
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:56,939
- What?
- Left.

765
01:28:56,974 --> 01:28:59,444
- You do not see.
- Trust me.

766
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:15,645
Let's see
Height how to dance.

767
01:29:39,898 --> 01:29:41,274
DECAPITEAZĂ

768
01:29:53,613 --> 01:29:55,425
Do not kill anyone
besides me.

769
01:30:03,907 --> 01:30:05,155
Back-to-back!

770
01:30:07,246 --> 01:30:09,292
- I see.
- No.

771
01:31:45,845 --> 01:31:47,356
Stop it up!

772
01:31:47,391 --> 01:31:49,228
- It can not be that way.
- Yes, that's

773
01:31:49,262 --> 01:31:51,064
- How do you know?
- Simply know.

774
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:52,362
Come on.

775
01:32:03,166 --> 01:32:05,130
Gloanţe of adamantiu.

776
01:32:05,555 --> 01:32:08,926
Let's see how they'll survive
with his thick căpăţâna.

777
01:32:08,961 --> 01:32:11,528
It can not stop.
Neither it.

778
01:32:11,563 --> 01:32:12,853
It will heal.

779
01:32:12,887 --> 01:32:15,083
The brain will heal.

780
01:32:16,413 --> 01:32:19,171
But memories will not be back.

781
01:32:35,445 --> 01:32:38,457
That does not change anything
relationship between us, Victor.

782
01:32:39,917 --> 01:32:41,356
I'm done.

783
01:32:41,391 --> 01:32:43,949
November I'll never finish, Jimmy.

784
01:32:43,984 --> 01:32:45,913
We fraţi.

785
01:32:45,948 --> 01:32:48,534
Fraţii they take care of each other.

786
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:23,739
- You to miss me?
- God ...

787
01:33:25,871 --> 01:33:30,083
When you say you'll kill everyone,
I thought that just overreacting.

788
01:33:31,207 --> 01:33:32,845
Come on up ...

789
01:33:32,881 --> 01:33:35,181
The guy who I seem to exaggerate?

790
01:33:35,216 --> 01:33:36,778
Your welcome.

791
01:33:44,034 --> 01:33:46,364
Some children try to go
on the island.

792
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:47,850
- We despărţim. Go!
- Now.

793
01:34:09,248 --> 01:34:11,265
I love you.

794
01:34:18,831 --> 01:34:19,722
No ...

795
01:34:23,336 --> 01:34:24,865
I'm cold.

796
01:34:25,145 --> 01:34:27,845
Listen, you'll get here.

797
01:34:27,881 --> 01:34:29,734
- You understand?
- Yes.

798
01:34:29,769 --> 01:34:31,587
Slowly and with care.

799
01:34:36,372 --> 01:34:38,185
I can get better.

800
01:35:58,414 --> 01:36:01,059
You should make you
to water and on the trigger,

801
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:03,996
but that he would not do better than you.

802
01:36:05,793 --> 01:36:07,609
Drop the gun.

803
01:36:12,903 --> 01:36:18,021
Go and never come off.

804
01:36:55,655 --> 01:36:57,960
<i> It'll be all right, Scott.</i>

805
01:36:57,994 --> 01:37:00,319
<i> My name is Charles Xavier.</i>

806
01:37:00,354 --> 01:37:02,610
<i> that I am a mutant and you.</i>

807
01:37:02,645 --> 01:37:07,157
<i> - I hear thoughts.
- Yes. And I hear them on yours.</i>

808
01:37:07,381 --> 01:37:09,628
You are safe now.

809
01:37:09,663 --> 01:37:11,876
<i> Veniţi. We gotta go.</i>

810
01:38:00,612 --> 01:38:02,283
Children are safe.

811
01:38:12,163 --> 01:38:15,158
- Who are you?
- How that is who I am?

812
01:38:15,509 --> 01:38:17,835
I'm the one who brought you here.
Now we gotta go.

813
01:38:19,175 --> 01:38:21,225
Where am I?

814
01:38:21,427 --> 01:38:23,820
Listen, I am your friend.

815
01:38:24,025 --> 01:38:25,259
Friend.

816
01:38:25,293 --> 01:38:26,837
What's my name?

817
01:38:26,971 --> 01:38:28,381
What's my name?

818
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:30,792
Your name is Logan.

819
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:36,752
Trust me.
We gotta go.

820
01:38:42,297 --> 01:38:43,943
Come after me.

821
01:38:48,287 --> 01:38:50,081
Now!

822
01:39:24,051 --> 01:39:25,764
I know you?

823
01:39:29,212 --> 01:39:30,851
No.

824
01:39:35,695 --> 01:39:39,796
I'll like what you did in this place.
We gotta go.

825
01:39:40,150 --> 01:39:42,231
I can handle myself.

826
01:39:46,984 --> 01:39:48,279
Good luck.

828
01:41:16,912 --> 01:41:18,909
Colonel Stryker?

829
01:41:22,739 --> 01:41:26,256
- Colonel William Stryker?
- Yes.

830
01:41:27,631 --> 01:41:33,881
You searched for questioning
on the death of Gen. Munson.
