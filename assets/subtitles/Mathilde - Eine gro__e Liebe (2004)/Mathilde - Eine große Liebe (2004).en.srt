1
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:10,214
Five soldiers condemned to death were lead to
the sector of Bullavent,

2
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,090
near the Somme River.

3
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,287
The first one was a great adventurer many years before

4
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,001
He wore on his neck the number 2124.

5
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,420
He came from a recruitment center of La Seine

6
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,214
He was wearing boots

7
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,383
He took them from a German soldier.

8
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,717
Before, soldier 2124,

9
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,803
called Bastoche

10
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,013
was with a beautiful redhead girl

11
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,099
called Véronique Passavant.

12
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,188
He was carpenter in the " La Bastille"

13
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,282
Sometimes between two furniture pieces

14
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:23,203
They went to drink a beer in the pub of Petit
Louis on the street "The Golden Hand"

15
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:28,584
He took the boots from an enemy
who didn't need them any more.

16
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,002
in order to replace them,

17
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,299
once filled up with straw and newspaper paper,
They replaced his former boots.

18
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,606
He went before a military tribunal
for voluntary mutilation.

19
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:56,403
They found residue of gunpowder in the wound on his
hand, and he was condemned to death.

20
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:20,802
The second soldier wore the number 4077, and
was from another recruitment center of La Seine.

21
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,517
He worked on the Steel for the state railroads in
Manille.

22
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,604
His name was Francis Ganière, We called him "Six Soux"

23
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,191
He knew that the poor
were building the cannons
which will kill them

24
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,693
and that the wealthy people sold them.

25
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:42,282
He tried to explain it during
the barrackings, but he didn't explain well.

26
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:47,287
In addition, the cheap wine : their friend in the
misery, made the soldiers so pissed,

27
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:52,709
that he didn't even know how
to interrupt them.

28
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,503
1818 was without any doubt the bravest soldier,

29
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,213
And the most dangerous one.

30
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,592
He once killed the officer of his team.

31
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,804
An officer who hit the dead.

32
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,813
Get up ! Get up !

33
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:59,818
You, go away!

34
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,917
No one knew it.

35
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:42,486
Benoît Notre Dame was a farmer.

36
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,117
One morning in the month of August,
they went to take him away from his farm,

37
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,996
and they forced him on the train.

38
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,090
Be aware of the cables!

39
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:09,513
The phone cables were
the only way to connect to the world of the living.

40
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,891
By that fine thread, they were hoping for
the grace of the president Raymond Poincare
to spare their lives.

41
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,395
Even if the only one here who believed
that was him...

42
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,399
Number 7328,  recruited from
the island of Corsica.

43
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,110
was Ange Bassignano

44
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:29,199
According to all people who knew him,
no one ever had a more unsuitable name.

45
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,787
'The Angel' was a liar, a cheater, a fake.

46
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,914
An informer and agitator.

47
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:51,680
Before, he had been the procurer (pimp) of Tina Lombardi

48
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,185
Because of her,
He had been condemned to jail for five years
for an honor or love crime
.

49
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,520
Depending on the whether they
were a woman or a man.

50
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,484
Actually... it was a deal
between
the procurers (pimps) of the village.

51
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,909
During the summer of 1916 they recruited
delinquents

52
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,120
in order to be able to replace losses within the
massacred regiments

53
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,081
In Berdun hell, it was up to them.

54
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,504
For whom are Those tombs ?

55
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:28,300
Well Actually... well... as tomorrow they are
going to attack...

56
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,596
So we anticipate.

57
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,116
Be aware of the cable.

58
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,711
The fifth soldier was a kid who belonged to the section of 17.

59
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,715
He just needed 5 months to be 20 years old.

60
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,512
And now, he was afraid of everything.

61
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,597
Of the French cannons which were firing so much.

62
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:21,395
Of the wind that spread
the gas of the hunters of robbery, of the executions.

63
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,398
Before the war he was not like this, he was just the
opposite...

64
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:29,111
He defied storms to help keep lighthouses
working when the tide rose.

65
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,613
Charge !!

66
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,811
Then one detail will change everything.

67
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:06,083
There you go kid, you will return to see your
fiancee, you just got your way out.

68
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,001
Yep, you got your way right to the court-martial.

69
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,088
My sergeant, close your eyes for a change,
he already suffered enough, don't you think?

70
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,006
Sergeant they may condemn him to death

71
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,007
Be understanding for a change!

72
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,008
Shut your mouth!

73
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,009
Come on Sergeant..

74
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,511
Shut the fuck up !

75
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,603
When Mathilde and Manech made love for the
first time

76
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:30,691
Manech fell asleep with his hand over her left breast.

77
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,213
Whenever he felt the wound on his hand beating,

78
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,300
it was like feeling
Mathilde's heart beating.

79
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,887
And each beat will make him closer to her.

80
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:06,518
If Manech were dead, Mathilde would know.

81
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,813
After the news of his death,
she desperately clung

82
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:14,484
to her intuition like a fine thread.

83
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,779
Still, she never gets discouraged.

84
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,908
Mathilde has a cheerful disposition.

85
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:24,912
She knows that if ever her thread
doesn't connect her to her lover

86
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,208
Well that's not too bad,
she still can hang herself with it.

87
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:38,300
In June of 1920
Mathilde received
a letter from a nun.

88
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,304
A sick man from the "Le Reim"
hospital wanted to meet her.

89
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:47,601
He was with Manech
in January 1917, on the front
of the Somme.

90
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,402
In August 1912, he was a good
looking man, wasn't he ?

91
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,907
It is of lemon, with direct gear box.

92
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,118
Please tell me what happened to Manech

93
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,997
In January 1917 they ordered me to
escort five

94
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,000
condemned men to the front.

95
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,796
Was he among them ?

96
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,297
Yeah.

97
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,802
I had to take them to the first line of
the trench.

98
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:33,105
Gendarmes waited for us with the prisoners next to
a small cemetery in ruins.

99
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,907
What the fuck are you doing with those German boots?

100
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:44,908
I am waiting.

101
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:49,997
Waiting for what ?
To be spared by Poincare?
You can dream on Dude!

102
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:53,792
He already signed it.
Normally I should not have been
condemned.

103
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,295
I am from Corsica, you know, not French!

104
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:07,806
Let him be. He loses a wee bit his head for

105
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,100
Lucky him.

106
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,317
Are you done, lieutenant?

107
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:25,115
That soldier, He doesn't have long before
he dies, the cold will kill him.

108
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:33,707
What about Manech? ...Does the wound on his hand make
him suffer badly??

109
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,086
We had to amputate two fingers,
but it seemed he was doing okay.

110
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:44,092
They took them to a trench called "the
bingo twilight".

111
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:04,780
Fucking hell. Could you make sure to kick these
useless people out of the trench on your way ??

112
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,282
To kick their ass so as to come along faster?

113
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,410
My orders were to deliver you
the five condemned men, I don't care about
the rest.

114
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,413
Then I will tell them what my orders are...
to throw these guys from  the trench.

115
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:18,001
and to let them die like dogs between the two
firing lines.

116
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:22,506
Those are my fucking orders
Sergeant!

117
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:27,594
You understand Sergeant, we have a special
tactical agreement with the Germans.

118
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:32,808
The sector is wee bit sleepy, a kick in the
ass and all the shit will explode in our faces !

119
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,604
The soup guys, You are lucky it is warm.

120
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:49,199
And what would you like to get kiddo?

121
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,995
A chocolate cup and a piece of bread with honey.

122
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,706
Unless I have to kill my parents: I will get that for you.

123
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,917
Do you mind lieutenant?

124
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,880
Don't worry, he is an orphan,
but he will no doubt get you what
you want.

125
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:08,218
He is the chief of the kitchens.

126
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,889
15 minutes later, he brought everything.

127
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,517
Bread with salt, honey of lavagne and...

128
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,897
Cacao of Nigeria.

129
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,903
Happiness

130
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,322
There you go kid, do you have anyone to write to?

131
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:29,990
Do you have a girlfriend?

132
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,992
Mathilde

133
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,620
His girlfriends's name is Mathilde.

134
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,708
Mathilde

135
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,420
I feel like her heart beats in me with Morse code.

136
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,300
We are about to get married.

137
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:54,515
They condemned us and we don't have to wait for the
end of war anymore.

138
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:59,394
I will go Home when the
execution is over.

139
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:12,491
Maybe it is better that I don't tell you the
end.

140
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,619
I am lame, not stupid

141
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,497
Tell me what happens.

142
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,000
We opened a breach in the wire fences.

143
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:25,504
and helped the five soldiers to fight against the cold.

144
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:33,011
Célestin Poux gave your boyfriend one of his red wool
gloves, so that the hand was protected.

145
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,515
Is it far away ??

146
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:40,185
Less than 100 meters. Far for the grenades and
close for the artillery.

147
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,188
And not to mention the gas.

148
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,107
Do you think that they will be all right?

149
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,902
If they don't fly in the air,
they will very likely die of hunger and cold.

150
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:52,281
In any case the Germans will shut up for a while.

151
00:17:56,994 --> 00:18:00,414
Bastoche the carpenter has been embraced
by a corporal.

152
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:05,085
It was obvious they knew each other before the war.

153
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,214
Soon... we took them outside the trench.

154
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,303
- Assholes.

155
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,397
- Shit!
- Shut up!

156
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,987
In September 1914, I could easily lift 70 kilos.

157
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:35,490
Moreover I was already not in great shape like
in the past.

158
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,913
But that morning, in january 1917
was Manech still alive?

159
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,918
At the dawn, Favart shout out their names.

160
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:49,713
All, except the farmer from Dordogne, responded.

161
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,090
- Bassignano?
- Present.

162
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,218
- Bouquette?
- what the hell do you want?

163
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,888
- Langonnet?
- Yeah, I am here.

164
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,891
Man, you should hide in a better spot.

165
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:06,104
Notre Dame? Notre Dame?

166
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,817
I know nothing else.

167
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:14,613
I retired to write my report
young lady.

168
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,996
At last soldier, the English have come
to take our place, we can go.

169
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,998
And the subject bingo?

170
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,208
What is that?

171
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,002
The list of the condemned signed by
Captain Favourier.

172
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:32,214
Do I leave it there?
Nope, give it to me.

173
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:45,018
Don't stay there like an idiot.
What are you waiting for?

174
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,980
You are promoted sergeant first thing in the
morning and leave for the Bosbos.

175
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:52,401
Even so my commander, this mission is
going away to be stuck in my throat.

176
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:57,114
Good news, there are balsamic caramels for the
throat there.

177
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,408
The caramels of the Bosbos.
We are done.

178
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,995
Some months later, I had been
hurt in the Somme.

179
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,915
I found myself in the same ambulance as
Chardolot.

180
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:10,002
One of the officers in "the bingo twilight".

181
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,588
But he only had a few days to live.

182
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:18,302
Eh oh, It is me Esperanza.

183
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,680
Bingo twilight, you remember?

184
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,600
Oh, sorry I didn't recognize you.

185
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,811
Tell me, my no man's land boys...

186
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,688
How did the story finish ?

187
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:30,689
What do you think ?

188
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,609
No survivor ??

189
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,195
Do you feel remorse?

190
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,989
You should have stayed with us in Bingo.

191
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,994
I saw the capital Ms written down

192
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,413
... underpants, an albatross.

193
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,709
You are delirious. You have the flu.

194
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:55,297
We threw between two lines five boys alive,
then we recovered five cold pieces of meat.

195
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,093
So...

196
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:04,515
I lost my vision sergeant, but
I imagine your face.
That makes my day.

197
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:08,602
He really spoke of capital Ms and an albatross?

198
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,105
Yep ... and of underpants.

199
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:17,486
There you go Young lady,
everything the condemned men
in Bingo ever possessed.

200
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,489
They asked me to send everything to their families.

201
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:23,408
My health didn't allow me to do it.

202
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,997
It is a copy of the letter of the farmer Benoît
Notre Dame to his wife.

203
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,708
I sent the original one to her
when I left Bingo.

204
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,212
His health is due to the gas in the lungs right?

205
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:39,216
Nope, it is because he got the Spanish flu.

206
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:43,804
You can notice, the death is lurking and catches
us totally by surprise.

207
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:51,687
Mathilde, you don't have to be pissed off,
you can talk to me.

208
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,983
If you can't talk, just stay quiet.

209
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,987
But sometimes when we start speaking, it's
when we start crying.

210
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,115
And when crying
we talk about what you didn't want to

211
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:05,909
hear, you know what I mean?

212
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:11,290
I will not have to bear that silly face anymore.

213
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:45,407
Petit Louis tell Vero that I will always think about
her and that it is too bad she doesn't want to

214
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:50,996
talk to me, I met Biscotte again
and we made up. Good bye
my friend, Bastoche

215
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:58,921
Benoît Notre Dame Number 1818
I will not be able to write again
for a while.

216
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:01,882
Tell Berney I will pay everything by the month of March.

217
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,717
He sells his installment for too much.

218
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,802
You have to be careful.

219
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:10,891
Tell my Bagtistan that I hope nothing bad will happen to him.

220
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:14,603
I have never known such a nice person.
I love you, Benoît.

221
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,900
For Tina Lombardi from Ange Bassignano.

222
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:04,695
If the dog enters the room before they call me
for the dinner, Manech must be still alive.

223
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:14,580
I am not hungry.

224
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:22,796
The dinner is ready.
Come Malthide, let's go to eat.

225
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,091
I'm coming.

226
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:28,802
Mathilde was born on the first of January 1900

227
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:31,388
That makes it very easy to determinate one's age.

228
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:35,601
In 1903 her parents passed away in
an accident on bus 44.

229
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,896
Since then Mathilde kept saying

230
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:44,985
Late parents... late parents...

231
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:51,617
Her Uncle Sylvain and Aunt Bénédicte
took care of her.

232
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:57,915
Thanks to the life insurance managed by the
lawyer of her parents, Pierre Marie Rouvières.

233
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:01,710
At five years old, Mathilde caught the polio virus.

234
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:06,507
She stayed several months in the bed in spite of
the mustard cataplasms,

235
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:08,091
the pendulums,

236
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:11,887
and the infusions of shamrock with four leaves.

237
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:16,892
Today Mathilde is 20 years old, she plays tuba,

238
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:21,688
because it is the only instrument that seems to
give the distress signal.

239
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:25,901
The dog always farts when it sleeps

240
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:28,487
Whenever Bénédicte hears the dog, she says

241
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,114
the farty dog betrayed.

242
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:34,201
Mathilde needs to get daily massages for
her legs.

243
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:38,914
Georges Cornu the champion of Britain in free
style swimming gives her massage.

244
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,583
At the beginning she was anxious.

245
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,585
But she got used to it.

246
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,214
When Mathilde was in the mood, she imagined that
Georges Cornu admired the shape of her body.

247
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:48,882
and he couldn't repress his desire.

248
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:50,884
As a matter of fact, one day he dared to remark :

249
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:56,598
You have very beautiful curves young lady,
and I can assure you that I have touched lot of women.

250
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,186
So Mathilde didn't know anymore
if she could call him :

251
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,604
My dear Gorge...

252
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:06,108
My loved Gorge...

253
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:08,819
Gogo

254
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:14,700
Sometimes, before sleeping she imagined herself in
hot situations

255
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,498
Mathilde never had to use

256
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:24,501
all her imagination to succumb to the pleasure.

257
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:31,884
But since he disappeared, she cannot think
about her fiance when she seeks pleasure.

258
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:45,606
If I was you I would forget everything Mathilde, it is of no use to
look for nothing.

259
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:48,692
Moreover if he were alive why did he not give any sign, huh?

260
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,111
Because he had been made a prisoner.

261
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:54,490
He stayed with a german girl
with two blond tresses with big tits.

262
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,994
A Breton eating sauerkraut every single day. ..impossible.

263
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:01,997
Are you sure you don't want me to help you??

264
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:04,416
Oh no but I prefer you to keep your feet on the ground.

265
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,001
Well I will need to feel my legs for that!

266
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,002
What did you say??

267
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:07,920
Nothing

268
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,921
I did hear you.

269
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:13,008
What you just said doesnt make any sense.

270
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,511
Manech cannot be a prisoner in Bingo, because

271
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:17,596
It is where we find the enemy lines.

272
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,892
Generally winners can take the prisoners.

273
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:26,313
Maybe he lost his direction, or he hides somewhere
so as not to go to jail.

274
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:31,401
My sweet Mathilde you read
too many novels.
You have to go back to reality.

275
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:34,404
You are young and beautiful,
you could easily find a husband
in spite of....

276
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,994
In all that story there is something
that does not add up.

277
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:41,995
I must find back

278
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:44,998
the plunderer of kitchens... Célestin Poux.

279
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,084
What would you want kiddo?

280
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:50,712
Or maybe the prostitute from Corsica, maybe
she knows things more than I do.

281
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,714
Tomorrow I go away to Paris.

282
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,508
What ?
What for??

283
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:58,595
To look for a survivor of Bingo twilight.

284
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,488
... I have archives all the way up to the ceiling.

285
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:18,490
You can't imagine the number
of cases which never saw the light of day.

286
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,285
If Germain Pire did not come in hand.

287
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:24,496
Have a look at this,

288
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,793
A big case, an extremely delicate one. In 1917 a train
with soldiers derails

289
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,920
427 dead.

290
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:34,006
Thanks to the investigation we discovered that
the official

291
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:38,594
gave the order to leave although the brakes
did not work.

292
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:41,180
It was a concealment maneuver

293
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,181
from the government of Poincare.

294
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:45,184
The only option for the victim
families was to find

295
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,812
the official... Germain Pire.

296
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:50,480
The spy that chirps.

297
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,817
Oh way worse, young lady. And I found the official.

298
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:57,404
For the sorrow of the high military spheres.

299
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:59,990
Allright, in the cemetery of Craon.

300
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:05,996
As soon as I packed my suitcases I left to go after them,
Poux Célestin and his lover from Corsica.

301
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:09,208
And what about the fees ?

302
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:14,087
Look my lady, The spy that chirps
knows to whom he should pluck.

303
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:19,009
For you it would be 20 francs per day.

304
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:21,720
Without the expenses of course.

305
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,306
And why would you do me that favour?

306
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:27,809
Hélène come on to say hello !

307
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:31,480
Don't worry about the expenses of Germain Pire.
He eats little, and does not drink.

308
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,982
And he is very sparing in gratuities.

309
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,490
Good morning.
Good morning.

310
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,908
Notre Dame de Paris?

311
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:47,788
No, not Notre Dame de Paris, I call you from
Paris about Notre Dame, Benoît.

312
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:51,917
Ah Benoît Notre Dame yes, a strong farmer and of
great heart.

313
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:56,296
He died for the mother country, we say that the
mother country has cleared me of good people.

314
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:59,299
His wife and her small Bagtistan
still live there?

315
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,093
Madame Minne I can't hear nothing!

316
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:06,390
No, one day she sold everything and they went
away without leaving direction.

317
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,517
Is it a choir that I hear behind your back?

318
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:11,895
it's a choir indeed dear lady, I am in the church.

319
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:15,399
However that is not an excuse
for not hearing you well.

320
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,319
Thanks Father, Good bye.
You're welcome.

321
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:22,197
Bingo twilight.

322
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:24,992
That does not have feet nor head. This is a scandal.

323
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,287
I thought that your vocation was to defend lost
causes.

324
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:31,290
When you were 10 years old your insolence had
grace, not when you are 20 years old.

325
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,709
As a matter of fact, it would be
time to take me seriously.

326
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:37,796
Mathilde, Mathilde, you squander your inheritance
in an absurd chimera.

327
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:41,800
Bingo twilight, and why not Yupi Tralalala...

328
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,094
I want to consult military files.

329
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:48,807
Mathilde let's say
there were any truth in there.

330
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:53,604
And if one of the condemned
men ever survived he would face
forced labor. And you know it!

331
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:57,316
Your investigations would cause him
very dangerous problems.

332
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,320
Be sensible, they trusted the interests to me...

333
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,987
... your parents.

334
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:02,988
Late parents.

335
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:08,285
Actually, my happiness was one of their interests.

336
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:16,502
Good bye, and thanks.

337
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:23,008
My sweet Mathilde
do not be like that please.

338
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:29,681
I think about your future,
it hurts me much to see you got
worse despite your massages.

339
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:34,686
All right all right I will see
what I can do.

340
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,911
I can't put that though in Lourdes..

341
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:22,609
Good morning lady I am looking for Tina
Lombardi I've known her since she was a kid and..

342
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:32,911
Pardon ladies I am a political uncle of Tina
Lombardi and I would like to er....

343
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:41,712
Please, I am in charge of the interests of the
Lombardi family in the continent,

344
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:47,217
and I am looking for Tina. It is about a small heritage...

345
00:32:57,186 --> 00:32:59,980
Are you the man who is looking for Tina
Lombardi?

346
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:00,981
No, in fact no.

347
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:10,491
Don't you know Corsica ? It is very pretty place.

348
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:13,410
Very colorful.

349
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,497
But Tina
Lombardi went away after
the bad business

350
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:22,002
Luckily a member of the police
found her whereabouts in the Leville Bar.

351
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:25,506
Valentin Emilia Maria Lombardi, called Tina,
had been registered

352
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:32,095
in 1916 near the quarter of regiment 23 in
Marseilles.

353
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,807
After that she ran away.

354
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:39,811
I lost her tracks in Lyon, and trust me I didn't
stop looking.

355
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:54,993
She has disappeared in the
district of the Croix Rousse.

356
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:55,994
What you mean is you have given up.

357
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,414
Not at all, Pire never lets it go.

358
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:03,585
Pire is obstinate, a detective who gives up,
he doesn't exist young lady.

359
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:07,089
Perfect, thanks.

360
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,587
Not the eyes, no

361
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:10,003
What do you drink ?

362
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:17,302
This is my fiance, and there is the
carpenter.

363
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,514
I believe that you know him.

364
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:29,189
No. I am suddenly thirsty, do you mind a
glass of wine?

365
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:31,483
It gives force and it cheers the way.

366
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,986
My great aunt told me the same thing.

367
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:36,989
She died in Besançon in 1911 at the age of 99 years old.

368
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:39,116
And she had never been ill.

369
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:43,787
Good luck.

370
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:44,788
I touch wood.

371
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,001
The war.

372
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:53,881
No, a hyena in the botanical garden.

373
00:36:54,590 --> 00:37:00,012
I wanted to stroke it to be a smart ass.
Bastoche and his friend did this for me.

374
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,513
Biscotte?

375
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,602
His best friend. They met in 1910
while saving a woman from drowning in a flood.

376
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:10,105
Bastoche was skillful, but Biscotte...

377
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:15,402
He was an artist, the king of firmer chisel.

378
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:19,114
He did all the joints.

379
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:21,283
It is a wonder!

380
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:24,119
It is for you.

381
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,290
Petit Louis tell Vero
that I will always think about her
and that it is too bad she doesn't want to

382
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:33,712
Talk to me, I met Biscotte again
and we made up. Good bye
my friend.

383
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:34,880
Bastoche

384
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:41,887
If they made up, they must have had a fall out.
Do you know the reason ?

385
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:43,680
A mystery.

386
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:46,517
But to tell you the truth, they went through so much together,

387
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:54,191
And out of the blue, they can't bear each other.

388
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:57,694
Biscotte went away to another army.

389
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:03,992
And he died in the bombing of a
military hospital while he was injured.

390
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:07,788
Anyway, I am glad they made up before.

391
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:12,417
It seems that it will not be
very busy here today.

392
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:14,586
Do you serve drinks?

393
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:19,007
It seems you are again thirsty huh?

394
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:22,219
Maybe he has a wooden hand
but he still has a big heart.

395
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:24,096
Let's drink to love. The true one!

396
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,681
Do you know who that is, Véro?

397
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:28,892
Véronique Passavant. His girlfriend, his lover.

398
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:31,103
He often came here with her.

399
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:33,480
What could have happened as
she didn't want to talk to him anymore ?

400
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:38,819
I suppose he has been unfaithful
and she never forgave him.

401
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,618
Voila, here is the place for the year 1917.

402
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,705
What are the red files about ??

403
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,206
Top Secret Defense

404
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:53,417
We need higher clearance for them.

405
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,002
This way please,
upstairs.

406
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,003
Go to help him

407
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:58,005
Oh right.

408
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:01,300
Suppose that the highest person is yourself

409
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,303
... then Mr. Rouvières and I would have
clearance right ?

410
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:06,096
If I had that kind of mind

411
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,098
I would not be an Official.

412
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:11,185
Mathilde please consider yourself lucky
to have been able to come here.

413
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:14,188
Normally it would take months.

414
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:19,485
Like I told you, they say everything is in order
but actually it is totally in chaos.

415
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:20,486
To see... in front of the Somme.

416
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:22,905
Sector of Bullavent, trench 108.

417
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:25,491
You know what I mean. This is a chaos!

418
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:27,409
It is a real mess.

419
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,580
Can I help you?

420
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:33,707
I thank you for the management

421
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:34,708
... with the General, I say.

422
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:35,709
Good, he is a great friend of mine.

423
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:40,005
I know the sector very well,  two
friends of mine died there.

424
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:42,508
Then it has been a very bloody war...

425
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:46,887
I don't think that things will get better
It is very difficult to find a maid nowadays.

426
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:48,013
It seems like a lie.

427
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:51,892
We would like to know that passage in trench 108.

428
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:57,314
... 104, trench 105, 107, where is the 106 one ??

429
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:58,315
See? A mess.

430
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:02,110
Trench 108... this is a bloody mess.

431
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:07,407
Good 108, here these...

432
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:10,202
... Taken by us in October of 1916

433
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:12,579
and renamed Bingo twilight.

434
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:15,082
And why not trooi Tralala?

435
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:16,792
on 6 January there is nothing

436
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,919
on 7 january great confrontation with numerous losses...

437
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:21,588
Favourier captain, the professor of history died
in combat...

438
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:24,299
The lieutenant... An adviser of insurances!

439
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:27,094
The corporal.... Good that but it gives...

440
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:32,391
That is weird, a part of the losses are classified confidential.

441
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:35,102
Confidential? It means...

442
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,020
I am sorry.

443
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:39,106
And we can do nothing about it?

444
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:40,107
No nothing

445
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:41,108
We can only get up to here.

446
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,109
I am sorry.

447
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:46,113
Not even the general himself could do
anything about it.

448
00:40:56,081 --> 00:41:00,210
Even so, I thank you for your time.

449
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:07,217
I am sorry, there is nothing which can be of any help to you.
Really ordinary files.

450
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,219
It was one possibility.

451
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:11,513
Everything is a chaos!

452
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:17,895
You are incorrigible Mathilde...!

453
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:20,814
... no lady, that is totally impossible

454
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:23,484
No, without the seal of the ministry it is
impossible.

455
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:26,695
I hope that this leaf is not classified..

456
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:35,621
Pierre Marie, if it is important You must tell me.

457
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:39,791
Nope, that is nothing. Only one permission.

458
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:42,085
Of the president ?

459
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,007
So what, every so often the president can give
it to soldiers who deserve it.

460
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:49,593
That is it.

461
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:52,596
I take both of you out

462
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:17,704
Corporal Bouquette Clevert, Ganière Francis

463
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:22,709
Soldier Notre Dame Benoît, soldier Bassignano
Ange

464
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:25,420
Soldier Langonnet Manech

465
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:29,508
By voluntary mutilation the sentence to capital
punishment.

466
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,389
I count up to 7 and if the train doesn't enter a tunnel

467
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:39,893
Or the conductor does not come. Manech is dead

468
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:44,481
One, two, three,

469
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:48,694
four, five, six

470
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:51,905
Tickets please.

471
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:54,616
April fool !

472
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:14,303
As soon as you finish eating your meal, we will
pay your announcement.

473
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:18,807
It compensates all information referring to
Bingo twilight. is that okay for you??

474
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:21,810
Yes, try to encourage her, it would
give her appetite.

475
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:24,104
You would have taken her to the
camperre festival.

476
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:25,189
What for?

477
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:26,982
To  distract you a wee bit.

478
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,485
Not to mention you
could find a nice boyfriend.

479
00:43:29,485 --> 00:43:31,487
But what for ??

480
00:43:31,487 --> 00:43:34,364
So you can marry and raise a family!
Tell her!

481
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,200
Can I have some too?

482
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,910
Do you drink wine now?

483
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,287
A wine glass gives force and cheers the way.

484
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:41,914
Where did you get that from ??

485
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:44,500
On the street "the gold hand", the owner of the
bar The Dead Hand, He has a wooden hand.

486
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,086
His great aunt said that before
dying, at the age of 99 years old
in Besançon in 1911.

487
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:50,088
Can you say that again?

488
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,591
In Besançon, in 1911

489
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:56,303
... one old lady lived until 99 years, who died leaving
behind a little nephew who has a wood hand

490
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:59,515
He is the owner of the dead hand,
a bar on the street the gold hand.

491
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:05,312
You see it? Already pissed off.

492
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,306
Look !

493
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:45,602
This is the Albatross.

494
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,481
It knows that it can use the wind at will.

495
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:38,906
Oh my gravel! My gravel!

496
00:45:41,617 --> 00:45:43,994
Véronique Passavant on July 17th 1920

497
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:48,290
Lady, I write you from the bar of Petit Louis who
told me about you.

498
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,211
I have to tell about a meeting I  had
which gave me a fright.

499
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:56,298
I was coming to the factory of Bastoche because
I was melancholic.

500
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:58,008
I would like to speak with Bastoche

501
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:01,011
Bastoche, but he died...

502
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:04,097
... in the front of the Somme, you didn't know?

503
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:07,309
But I am looking for something else.

504
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:08,310
What exactly??

505
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:11,104
In the hospital where I help the patients, there
are terminal syphilitics.

506
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:14,107
One of them has given this to me for you.

507
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:19,196
If you don't want to die covered by
purulent abscesses, you would do better
answering me!

508
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:22,491
The companion with whom Bastoche hides

509
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:25,994
Tell me, tell me who is he?

510
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:29,498
Well well I would not let myself be upset by
some young lady.

511
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:34,920
Tina Lombardi knows something we don't

512
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:38,298
What did you say??

513
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:42,177
Tina Lombardi knows something which
eludes us.

514
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:45,514
Something that would prove
that Bastoche is still alive.

515
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:47,683
And the other condemned men.

516
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:50,811
It is obvious she believes I am his angel.

517
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:56,483
But if Bastoche has been saved, Then I am sure
that he protected Manech.

518
00:46:56,608 --> 00:46:58,986
If he ever survived it.
Wait.

519
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:06,910
It can, but if not outside for that reason,
single I would have left to hang to me.

520
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:17,212
Are you winding me up you smart ass ?
Whenever you come here I must fix
the gravel.

521
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:21,717
As for the gravel, it is a question about style.
A letter for the young lady.

522
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,386
Ironworks R. Leprince, Paris 1920 July 25.

523
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:27,514
Young lady, I take advantage of Sunday today to
write to you with respect to your announcement

524
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:30,017
where it says that you are looking
for Célestin Poux and
other survivors

525
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:32,019
of Bingo twilight.

526
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:35,105
I knew that guy very well,
he was the best go-getter that
I ever met.

527
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:37,983
Thanks to him
I never starved myself.

528
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:43,780
Olivier Nergeton mechanical
toys manufacturer.

529
00:47:44,281 --> 00:47:49,495
Célestin Poux was our provider, we called
him the terror of the kitchens

530
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:55,083
He falsified the numbers of losses, so as to multiply
the money in order to get the soldiers more foods.

531
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,506
If you ever meet him, Tell him that the veterans
of Fontenau will never forget him.

532
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:03,383
Etienne Mauriaux, Professor, August 3 of 1920

533
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:11,391
He made us laugh ours heads off,
to get us food, he would even
tame the mascot of the company.

534
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:15,687
Good morning Madam, Germain Pire private
detective.

535
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,482
Oh yeah, Mathilde told us about you.

536
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:24,780
Sylvain Tell Mathilde to go downstairs,
the detective wants to see her.

537
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:35,999
The great Pire moves like hell, he can spend a
day in each site.

538
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,879
In any case we will need luck and patience to
get him.

539
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:43,215
A shame.

540
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:46,301
Mathilde I got you some salty cakes.

541
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,513
You will see if you like them.

542
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:52,015
You won't be better in the kitchen?

543
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:54,518
Thank you Bénédicte.

544
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:58,689
Allright, I leave you alone.

545
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:03,485
Poux is a mystery, whereas Tina Lombardi
that is another story

546
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:05,696
She misleads us with dead end leads.

547
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:08,198
And to make matters
worse she changes identities.

548
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,201
Anything new about Biscotte ?
Wait !

549
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:16,999
Look at this, this is Benjamín Gordes

550
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:20,210
it is the day where they got the carpentry
prize,

551
00:49:20,419 --> 00:49:23,505
for the sixth consecutive year.

552
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:25,215
But!

553
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:28,093
And yes, young lady.

554
00:49:29,887 --> 00:49:36,101
Biscotte, the best friend of Bastoche, is none
other than Benjamín Gordes.

555
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:39,104
And a soldier of the company told me

556
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:42,983
that they were close-knit before
they fought.

557
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:46,612
Leave me alone.

558
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,781
I do not want to fight with you.

559
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,117
Leave me alone.
Calm down!

560
00:49:55,913 --> 00:50:00,918
Bastard, Asshole .
Who got that idea ??
Me??

561
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,504
It was your idea.

562
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:05,506
It was just for a skirt matter.

563
00:50:06,507 --> 00:50:10,219
Véronique Passavant broke up with
Bastoche in June 1916.

564
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:13,388
And immediately afterwards, Bastoche fought with
Benjamín Gordes.

565
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:16,600
You don't have to be a lynx for that huh?

566
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,102
So they didn't see each other again until
in Bingo twilight?

567
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:21,605
Bingo twilight is where
everything finishes.

568
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:23,482
No, it is where everything started, Mr. Pire.

569
00:50:23,482 --> 00:50:25,609
Where everything starts.

570
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:28,695
Tina Lombardi is sure Bastoche
is still alive.

571
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:35,160
What made Bastoche different from the
others in Bingo twilight?

572
00:50:34,493 --> 00:50:36,787
That he was the only carpenter, no?

573
00:50:37,788 --> 00:50:40,582
There is a thing that differentiates Bastoche
from the others...

574
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,417
... the German boots.

575
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:46,505
He was the only one to
wear German boots!

576
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:48,715
But of course !
You are right !

577
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:51,009
Tina Lombardi just knew that her man

578
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:52,886
by wearing German boots
he could have got away with it.

579
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,889
It would suffice that they
had seen him with some companion.

580
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:57,891
I met two Frenchmen

581
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,518
they looked like tramps.

582
00:50:59,518 --> 00:51:01,603
... One of them got boots.
He got them from a german soldier

583
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:10,112
In addition to the german boots, we know that Bastoche
made up with his best friend.

584
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:15,742
Exactly! Who knows if it doesn't
make any change during that night.

585
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:19,288
If I can peel that apple without breaking
the skin then

586
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:23,625
Gordes found a way to help out
and save Bastoche,
and Manech.

587
00:51:26,712 --> 00:51:29,506
At that rate I won't put the cake in the oven
before the next year!

588
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:31,592
I must return to Paris.

589
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:32,593
What ??

590
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:34,386
I have to return to Paris.

591
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:38,390
Again? The inheritance
of your parents will go away like smoke.

592
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:40,684
Late parents.

593
00:52:19,515 --> 00:52:21,391
Excuse me,
where is Elodie Gordes?

594
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:23,185
That's the woman with the carrots.

595
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:26,104
Ah, thanks Sir.

596
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:33,111
Elodie Gordes?

597
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:33,821
Here for you.

598
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:35,989
I do not know him.

599
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,494
Which person don't you know??

600
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:45,207
Would it be that one by any chance?
Because Bastoche and
Biscotte had a fall out?

601
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,708
Was it because
of you??

602
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:47,709
You exagerate,
I do not have anything
to tell him.

603
00:52:47,709 --> 00:52:52,589
No, I just need to know.
Leave me alone!

604
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:57,094
They saw each other for the
very last time in the
bingo twilight

605
00:52:57,094 --> 00:53:01,014
My fiance was there too with Bastoche

606
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:03,308
In that excrement trench.

607
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:05,310
I need to understand.

608
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:09,815
I need to understand!

609
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:19,491
It is not what you think.
I can tell you everything.

610
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,203
Give me your address,
although I have misspelling,

611
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:29,334
I will put everything in a letter.
I promise you.

612
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,108
No letter for me?

613
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:55,319
What did you say?

614
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,320
There is no letter for me ?

615
00:53:57,196 --> 00:54:01,992
Only the newspaper...
It talks about the all world but
not about Elodie Gordes.

616
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:03,702
Very funny.

617
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:04,703
You are wrong.

618
00:54:04,786 --> 00:54:06,997
You can learn a lot of interesting things.

619
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:11,084
The president has opened an investigation on
the condemned men of Bingo twilight?

620
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:18,008
A man fell out of the train in the middle of the night

621
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:19,009
and in pajamas

622
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:21,094
At least him, he sleeps with pajamas.

623
00:54:21,303 --> 00:54:22,304
Eh?

624
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:23,305
He sleeps with pajamas!

625
00:54:38,695 --> 00:54:42,991
... and we recovered five cold cuts

626
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:57,506
You are already a thief, and now
you are pyromaniac.

627
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:13,313
Did you hurt yourself ??
No, I am fine.

628
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:19,528
For a change I don't have to gather the gravel, but
to collect the mailman.

629
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,781
You took away the gravel!
A good war!

630
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:24,992
There is no good war.

631
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:27,911
Do you want to drink something?
Yes please.

632
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:31,707
Miss, please keep secret my little secrets

633
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:34,918
When I met my husband,
he had four children from
a first marriage.

634
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,712
Not one kid was his.

635
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:39,882
By generosity he married with a
young tuberculosa widow

636
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:42,092
of Polish nationality, like me.

637
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:44,511
He considered the children as his
before she died.

638
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:46,388
Myself, I was unmarried mother
of a girl of 3 years.

639
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:49,892
So we found ourselves with a family
with 5 children,

640
00:56:00,486 --> 00:56:03,197
We had four years of happiness.

641
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:06,992
We had many plans. We dreamed to be able to
see the sea once in life.

642
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:09,286
But then the war started.

643
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:13,582
At first I thought that Bastoche's friend would
take care of him because they were together,

644
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:17,211
but when he came back for the first time, in
September of 1915

645
00:56:17,294 --> 00:56:19,213
Right after the campaign of Artois,

646
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:25,219
I understood right away nothing would
be like before.

647
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:33,685
This gives us the force to get on in life.

648
00:56:49,701 --> 00:56:53,497
A day in a battlefield in flames I saw my
companions

649
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:57,751
exploding like they
were firecrackers.

650
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:03,006
One time we even used the body
of a companion,

651
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:06,718
to use as a shield.

652
00:57:16,687 --> 00:57:20,107
He had been thinking about something
for a long time

653
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:23,610
it was in the second night that it started

654
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:28,407
You will understand that if I desert
they will arrest me.

655
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:34,288
The only way of getting away is to have
a sixth child.

656
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:40,377
When someone has 6 children, they send
the soldier back home.

657
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:43,297
As I already told him, He can't have children.

658
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:45,591
I could not imagine what to think.

659
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:51,889
But voila, he brought up the subject again.

660
00:57:52,014 --> 00:57:55,100
But it is me who asks you, Elodie, that is not
adultery.

661
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:58,520
And even less
if it is with Bastoche.

662
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,521
Don't touch !

663
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:05,319
None of the five children is mine,
who cares about another one??

664
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:08,489
Although it embarrasses me,
we would have to wait 9 months

665
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:09,990
... by then the war would already be over.

666
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,492
But now it will never be over!

667
00:58:11,492 --> 00:58:12,701
Those nine months will represent
a hope for me.

668
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:14,786
Don't you have more compassion??

669
00:58:15,496 --> 00:58:17,289
Then one day I found

670
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:20,209
a letter of Clevert Bouquette,
AKA Bastoche in the letterbox.

671
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:25,214
I put something colorful at the window
so he knows where to show up.

672
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:36,892
Good morning.
Good morning.

673
00:58:38,894 --> 00:58:41,688
I made some coffee, do you want some?
Oh yes, it would be nice, thank you.

674
00:58:41,897 --> 00:58:44,900
Come in.
No, You first.

675
00:58:51,907 --> 00:58:53,617
Thank you very much.

676
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,414
Do you want sugar ?
No, thanks.

677
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:08,590
It is of nacre?
Yes,  Benjamín made it.

678
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:20,769
It is curious we never met
Yes, before.

679
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:23,480
Are the children not home?

680
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:28,735
Yes, they are playing in the backyard.

681
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:34,908
A digestive with the coffee ?
Yes please.

682
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:40,789
In fact not... I am sorry.
I don't need it

683
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:45,210
I don't need it either.

684
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:49,506
Elodie look, we told him we did it.

685
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:53,093
So we are at peace for a while.
That is for the best.

686
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:56,013
For you, for me, for everybody.

687
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:07,793
It is funny, when you smile it looks like
a bracket.

688
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:13,006
It will close but the possible thing late.

689
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:17,010
The day after tomorrow, in the station.

690
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:38,991
Time to go, a very last smile okay?

691
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:43,412
In order to close the bracket.

692
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:46,206
I never have been pregnant.

693
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:49,501
But soon after, it was not the fear
which was tormenting my husband,

694
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:52,087
but the jealousy.

695
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:57,217
Where? When? Whichever times?
In which positions? Did you enjoy yourself?

696
01:01:57,301 --> 01:02:00,596
It became an utter torture for him and me.

697
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:03,599
Now Bastoche died...

698
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,519
And my husband died in the hospital bombing.

699
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,689
It did me good to be honest with
you Miss.

700
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:13,192
Sometimes I am scared of becoming crazy.

701
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:14,818
Elodie Gordes.

702
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:20,115
Mathilde hurry up, This Mr. Rouvières is on
the phone waiting for you.

703
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:24,703
Move, Move.

704
01:02:36,507 --> 01:02:40,802
Hello.
Mathilde, It's me Pierre Marie.

705
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:44,181
Erm, I have bad news for you.

706
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:48,185
Good or bad news, You were expecting for them,

707
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:52,105
... and that from now on, you will not be able to
continue ignoring.

708
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:55,984
The bottom line is, you
were right about one thing.

709
01:02:56,109 --> 01:03:01,782
Manech and his 4 companions
were indeed in that trench.

710
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:06,495
They are buried in the Tertullian cemetery

711
01:03:07,371 --> 01:03:13,168
They were first buried below a canvas
in a crater

712
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:17,297
There there, my little Mathilde.

713
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:28,100
In June of 1909 Mathilde was 9 years old,

714
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,061
Manech Langonnet... 10

715
01:03:31,395 --> 01:03:32,896
Does it hurt when you walk?

716
01:03:34,398 --> 01:03:36,191
It must have been Friday or Saturday.

717
01:03:37,568 --> 01:03:38,777
Mathilde doesn't remember anymore.

718
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:45,576
Do you have friends?

719
01:03:46,577 --> 01:03:48,996
If you want I could be your friend.

720
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:53,876
What is wrong, do i smell like fish?

721
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:57,796
Have you ever gone up the lighthouse?

722
01:03:58,172 --> 01:04:00,966
I can carry you up there!

723
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:04,678
...my father is the lighthouse keeper.

724
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:09,892
As you wish, you are a stuck up little girl!

725
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:11,977
Hey! Do you want me to kick your ass?

726
01:04:33,582 --> 01:04:36,793
How far can you see from the top of the lighthouse?

727
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:37,146
Lunch.

728
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:43,986
If dogfart stinks - furtune will come!

729
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:28,382
Manech Loves Mathilde

730
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:31,802
Manech Loves Mathilde

731
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:37,683
Manech Loves Mathilde
Mathilde Loves Manech

732
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:42,980
Manech Loves Mathilde

733
01:07:57,661 --> 01:08:00,164
Take this
But I don't smoke!

734
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:04,793
I know, I know, just take it.
It will help you make friends.

735
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:43,165
If I get to the curve before the car

736
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:45,792
Manech will come back safe

737
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:50,088
If I get to the curve...

738
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:02,976
If I get to the curve before the car
Manech will come back safe.

739
01:09:09,775 --> 01:09:13,070
If I get to the curve...

740
01:09:39,888 --> 01:09:42,683
Good morning.

741
01:10:07,499 --> 01:10:10,586
You used to brag about being
a year older than me.

742
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:14,882
Now I am older.

743
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:18,802
The name of the one that gave you
the glove is Poux.

744
01:10:19,094 --> 01:10:22,681
Célestin Poux. He is very slippery

745
01:10:24,683 --> 01:10:28,187
The detective I hired is called Pire.

746
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:31,398
Germain Pire.

747
01:10:34,193 --> 01:10:37,362
He hasn't found neither him nor
the prostitute from Corsica.

748
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:42,868
The thread has been broken Manech

749
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:45,871
...but I will not quit.

750
01:10:46,872 --> 01:10:50,083
I have faith in Tina Lombardi's clue.

751
01:10:51,585 --> 01:10:55,172
I need to know. Do you understand?

752
01:10:57,174 --> 01:10:59,968
That is why it is important that
I find Célestin Poux.

753
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:07,893
Well it's really a great pity, you know?

754
01:11:09,895 --> 01:11:13,690
We would be very happy by now.

755
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:20,197
Let's go Mathilde.
It's getting cold.

756
01:11:30,165 --> 01:11:33,502
Killed in combat
June 7th, 1917

757
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:48,684
Thouvenel?

758
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:53,772
What do you want?

759
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:03,782
Who are you?

760
01:12:06,785 --> 01:12:09,079
Are you the one who called me?

761
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,665
Who are you?

762
01:12:48,494 --> 01:12:51,788
The days passed without news
from Celestin Poux.

763
01:12:51,788 --> 01:12:53,874
Mathilde was overwhelmed
with sadness.

764
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:56,084
She has to eat or she'll get sick.

765
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:59,296
Then leave her the best part.

766
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:08,388
She'll end up leaving us a taste
for tragedy, you'll see!

767
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:17,189
At last, on September 15th, 1920,
at midnight.

768
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:20,692
The thread connected again...

769
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:42,965
"Victory! I have finally found
that slippery Poux"

770
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:44,800
I'm sending him with God's blessing
and Harley Davidson's.

771
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,595
Expenses included, of course.
Germain Pire.

772
01:13:49,596 --> 01:13:51,598
Célestin Poux, Road Terror.

773
01:13:52,182 --> 01:13:53,183
Is this your announcement?

774
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:56,979
Mathilde clenched her fists together,

775
01:13:57,187 --> 01:13:59,398
it was all she could do to avoid
shaking, crying

776
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:01,567
or looking like an idiot.

777
01:14:03,777 --> 01:14:07,072
I didn't see your fiancé fall,
I had gone to look for the ranch

778
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:10,284
Then I met with Levert, a guy
I met at the Boscos.

779
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:13,579
A negihbour of the Mosa Valley.
More a jerk than a neighbour!

780
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:16,665
But he knew how to distinguish Arabic coffee
from any other medicine.

781
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:20,669
We had a big problem when we mixed
coffee with charcoal.

782
01:14:20,878 --> 01:14:22,963
To trade it for Dutch tobacco.

783
01:14:23,172 --> 01:14:25,299
The last time you saw Manech,

784
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:27,467
was he alive?

785
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:30,679
It was impossible not to see him,
instead of hiding.

786
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:34,975
He was carving an M on the trunk
of a charred tree.

787
01:14:35,976 --> 01:14:39,563
He had time to carve three M's before
the albatross took him down.

788
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:42,274
The albatross?

789
01:14:42,566 --> 01:14:45,777
Albatross. Big sea bird
that follows

790
01:14:46,278 --> 01:14:49,490
like a travel companion without worries,

791
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:53,869
the ship that sails the bitter depths."

792
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:56,663
It's a poem by Baudelaire

793
01:14:56,788 --> 01:15:01,084
But in 1915, it was also a German plane,
with a machine gun on the back.

794
01:15:01,168 --> 01:15:03,962
Back then, it was impossible to shoot
through the helices.

795
01:15:46,797 --> 01:15:48,966
Did you give him the glove?

796
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:54,388
Red, thick wool. I had a girlfriend
that used to knit scarves.

797
01:15:54,596 --> 01:15:57,975
and gloves. I traded them with the Senegalese
that had frostbite on their fingers

798
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:01,562
for gold teeth that they took out of
dead german soldiers.

799
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:05,482
I melted them and thanks to them
I could buy the Harley.

800
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:10,070
But, are you sure Manech is dead?

801
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:14,366
A mate that saw the body told us,

802
01:16:14,491 --> 01:16:18,078
that with a wound like that, there was
no doubt about it.

803
01:16:18,662 --> 01:16:22,791
Of the 5, i only saw 3 of them get killed,
with my own eyes

804
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:24,501
I give up...

805
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:27,296
I give up... Don't shoot.

806
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:31,175
Mercy...I give up...
Let me through!

807
01:16:31,967 --> 01:16:34,386
I'm on your side...

808
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:39,391
Mercy!

809
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,186
I'm not French!
I'm Corsican.

810
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:44,480
I have nothing against the German.

811
01:16:44,563 --> 01:16:45,898
Poor man.

812
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:49,902
So you are not French.

813
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:53,989
Then lets nullify your birth certificate.

814
01:16:58,702 --> 01:17:00,496
It was one of our soldiers who shot.

815
01:17:00,496 --> 01:17:01,497
Thouvenel

816
01:17:02,581 --> 01:17:07,294
He had an itchy trigger finger, with a heart
of stone and eagle's eye.

817
01:17:08,879 --> 01:17:10,589
Poor man.

818
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,675
Do you want the truth?

819
01:17:14,092 --> 01:17:16,595
I'm an easy man, I would kill
my whole family for a stew.

820
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:18,263
Don't worry, he is an orphan!

821
01:17:18,597 --> 01:17:20,891
As well as for pickled meat and truffle puree

822
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:22,768
I just came from...

823
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:25,771
Ok! Who did you see die
with your own eyes?

824
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:29,191
The one infected with gangrene.

825
01:17:29,274 --> 01:17:30,692
Six-Soux?

826
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:31,693
Yes, the welder.

827
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:37,074
Comrades, before I die

828
01:17:37,282 --> 01:17:39,868
I have a last wish.

829
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:43,163
I would like to pee standing up.
like a man!

830
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:46,875
After that, comrades,
fire at will!

831
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:52,464
Good bye to life

832
01:17:52,589 --> 01:17:54,967
Goodbye to love.

833
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:58,887
And to all the women.

834
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,974
It is over.

835
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:04,184
It is the end.

836
01:18:04,268 --> 01:18:08,564
I curse this damn war.

837
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:12,568
This is the end.

838
01:18:12,693 --> 01:18:16,363
We will lose our lives.

839
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:19,992
We are all condemned.

840
01:18:20,075 --> 01:18:25,998
They are sacrificing us.

841
01:18:32,296 --> 01:18:33,297
And Bastoche?

842
01:18:33,297 --> 01:18:35,799
He was very well hidden and

843
01:18:35,799 --> 01:18:37,885
we couldn't find him.

844
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:41,889
The morning when we called all the names
he answered but no one could find him.

845
01:18:41,972 --> 01:18:44,099
He was like a ventriloquist.

846
01:18:44,183 --> 01:18:46,393
No, he was a carpenter.

847
01:18:46,477 --> 01:18:53,192
For what I heard, the albatross shot him down
at the same time as your fiancé.

848
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:18,675
The explosion set afire the albatross
that went down on the German line, at home.

849
01:19:21,178 --> 01:19:23,972
And what happened to the
farmer of Dordoña.

850
01:19:24,765 --> 01:19:27,976
He faked death from the beginning,
but it didn't do him any good.

851
01:19:28,393 --> 01:19:31,897
The Germans didn't like what
happened to their plane.

852
01:19:34,775 --> 01:19:38,570
When I came back with the ranch
the shooting had begun.

853
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:43,075
Then they started bombing.

854
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:13,397
Those that haven't lived it
don't know how it is.

855
01:20:13,772 --> 01:20:19,278
Your legs shake, they don't respond.
The heart beats like that of a terrified animal.

856
01:20:52,269 --> 01:20:55,481
Then I saw the farmer from Dordoña get killed.

857
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:04,364
We have to attack before they kill us.

858
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:07,075
Prepare bayonets!

859
01:21:07,284 --> 01:21:10,871
Prepare bayonets!

860
01:21:11,288 --> 01:21:13,582
Prepare bayonets!

861
01:21:20,589 --> 01:21:24,384
What I'm telling you is music
compared to what happened.

862
01:21:25,803 --> 01:21:30,766
For France...Attack!

863
01:21:50,786 --> 01:21:53,580
We had left behind the prisoners' bodies

864
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:57,292
When the shooting of the
machine guns started, the Maxim.

865
01:21:57,501 --> 01:22:01,088
...It was a masacre.

866
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,175
Lavrouye kept the paper...

867
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:48,802
Bring the stretchers!

868
01:22:48,886 --> 01:22:50,971
A paper? What paper?

869
01:22:51,889 --> 01:22:54,766
There wasn't time to say anymore.

870
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:02,900
That night there were triple soup servings.

871
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,862
Favart and Chardolot were doing
the report of casualties.

872
01:23:06,987 --> 01:23:10,866
Why are the five condemned
listed as soldiers of the batallion?

873
01:23:11,074 --> 01:23:13,285
We are following orders.

874
01:23:13,494 --> 01:23:15,996
That sounds like fiddling.

875
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:17,581
Fiddling !!
??????????????

876
01:23:17,789 --> 01:23:21,293
C'mon, the soup is getting cold!

877
01:23:24,087 --> 01:23:25,964
It is already cold.

878
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:29,176
But out of the 5, you only saw 3 die.

879
01:23:29,301 --> 01:23:30,886
With your eyes.

880
01:23:31,178 --> 01:23:34,097
Lady, false hope can only
cause pain.

881
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:35,766
No, it is not false hope.

882
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:37,100
Will you taste my plum pie?

883
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:38,894
I don't think I should!

884
01:23:38,894 --> 01:23:39,895
With a little cream.

885
01:23:41,563 --> 01:23:44,566
I like it when people
appreciate my cooking.

886
01:23:47,486 --> 01:23:49,696
You better lie down.

887
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,282
We all need to rest.

888
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:16,265
Easy, easy!

889
01:24:16,473 --> 01:24:21,186
You need more dignity, style!
It is clear that farming is your thing.

890
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:24,565
Hope in Mr. Mailman, I'll take
you to the next mailbox.

891
01:24:24,565 --> 01:24:28,569
But my bicyle. I'll take care of it.
I'm no quitter, I have been in the war.

892
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:30,487
Let's go!

893
01:24:31,488 --> 01:24:33,490
...is not my fault, i have asthma.

894
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:34,867
Yes, and asthmatic that rides a bicycle!

895
01:24:34,867 --> 01:24:36,201
But near the sea.

896
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:37,494
Oh sure, near the sea!

897
01:24:37,494 --> 01:24:39,371
Careful Célestin, you are not on a sidecar.

898
01:24:40,998 --> 01:24:44,001
Men, they are like children, eh?

899
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:47,087
As long as they don't play at
being soldiers.

900
01:24:47,462 --> 01:24:50,090
...tell Barney i want to liquidate
everything by the first days of March.

901
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:51,300
Sale the manure very expensive...

902
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:54,094
I can't believe this is about
such trivial things.

903
01:24:54,178 --> 01:24:56,263
Don't you think?

904
01:24:56,763 --> 01:24:58,390
It might be in code.

905
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:03,562
But the code of lovers cannot even be
solved with divine inspiration.

906
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:11,069
And Bastoche? If he was seen with the German
boots, he had to come out alive!

907
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:12,988
Not at all, miss.

908
01:25:13,363 --> 01:25:18,202
Private Gordes didn't want Bastoche to come out
of the trench with the enemy boots.

909
01:25:22,498 --> 01:25:25,000
If the Germans see you with them,

910
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:27,794
they will know you took them
from one of them.

911
01:25:32,174 --> 01:25:35,803
Then Tina Lombardi started with a wrong clue.

912
01:25:37,095 --> 01:25:39,097
Her soldier with German boots...

913
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:42,267
wasn't Bastoche!

914
01:25:42,601 --> 01:25:44,269
It was Gordes, exactly madam.

915
01:25:44,269 --> 01:25:46,480
He was acompanied by a young
man from the class of 17

916
01:25:46,897 --> 01:25:48,273
called Derochette.

917
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:51,568
I ran into some stretcher-carriers
that had just seen them.

918
01:25:52,069 --> 01:25:54,071
Eh, are you from Bingo?

919
01:25:54,863 --> 01:25:56,198
Why?

920
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:58,367
Tell that Private Gordes was
wounded on the head

921
01:25:58,575 --> 01:26:00,702
That we saw him next to a young
man in worse condition.

922
01:26:00,786 --> 01:26:03,789
His name is Derochette,
they were going to the aid station.

923
01:26:03,789 --> 01:26:05,374
Hooray for anarchy.

924
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:08,168
Anarchy!

925
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:25,978
What's wrong Mathilde?

926
01:26:28,564 --> 01:26:31,483
Mathilde, open up!

927
01:26:32,276 --> 01:26:33,485
Please, be reasonable!

928
01:26:33,485 --> 01:26:35,362
Could you tell me what you did to her?

929
01:26:35,487 --> 01:26:37,197
Nothing...

930
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:39,074
You have known for three years
that Manech is dead.

931
01:26:39,283 --> 01:26:41,577
That's what I call stubborness.

932
01:26:41,577 --> 01:26:44,997
No, it is called hope,
and Mr. Poux just killed it.

933
01:26:47,166 --> 01:26:50,377
Can I do something to make
it up to you?

934
01:26:53,672 --> 01:26:55,090
Yes

935
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:58,969
Take me to Bingo Crepuscule.

936
01:27:11,982 --> 01:27:14,276
You look like an Indian princess
riding an elephant.

937
01:27:15,277 --> 01:27:19,072
With her court,
riding her sadness.

938
01:27:20,073 --> 01:27:21,867
Here it is!

939
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:28,290
There it is, 100 meters ahead...

940
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:29,291
...the German trench.

941
01:27:31,293 --> 01:27:33,670
And the tree, the charred tree,
where is it?

942
01:27:33,879 --> 01:27:36,089
Oh! the trunks and all the bodies

943
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:39,968
were used to cover both trenches.

944
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:45,599
The five of them had one hand wrapped,
we found them there, 20 meters ahead,

945
01:27:45,682 --> 01:27:47,768
below a canvas with a little
dirt thrown on them.

946
01:27:47,768 --> 01:27:49,102
It was not a pretty sight.

947
01:27:49,102 --> 01:27:49,895
I can imagine!

948
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:52,272
The youngest looked like a boy.

949
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:56,068
Do you remember if he had a glove?

950
01:27:56,276 --> 01:27:58,195
A red glove, of thick wool?

951
01:27:58,195 --> 01:28:01,281
All of them had one hand wrapped,
i can remember that.

952
01:28:01,281 --> 01:28:04,785
But nothing on the other hand,
I didn't see a glove.

953
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:06,662
Athos!

954
01:28:06,787 --> 01:28:09,373
I don't like him removing the dirt.

955
01:28:09,581 --> 01:28:14,086
On this zone you remove the dirt a little
and you could find a mine

956
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:17,673
that could blow an arm or leg in
the blink of an eye.

957
01:28:20,175 --> 01:28:25,180
That's a crypt, there was a chapel
between the german line and ours...

958
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:28,100
...all that is left is a bunch of ruins.

959
01:28:28,267 --> 01:28:30,769
I can't rememeber anything!
I can't recognize anything!

960
01:28:53,876 --> 01:28:57,296
Is it possible Manech lost
the glove when he fell?

961
01:28:57,462 --> 01:28:59,173
It was made of thick wool,tightly woven.

962
01:28:59,298 --> 01:29:03,469
It fit very tight, the other
one lasted me until the end of the war.

963
01:29:05,596 --> 01:29:08,182
Maybe he took it out to write
on the trunk.

964
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:12,102
That I don't know,
but I don't think so.

965
01:29:13,061 --> 01:29:18,066
And what kind of red was it?
Bright red?

966
01:29:18,275 --> 01:29:22,488
Intense red. It had white dots woven in it,
it looked like an apple with worms.

967
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:39,463
Excuse me for approaching you
like this, but my husband's family

968
01:29:39,588 --> 01:29:41,673
suffered a lot during the war...

969
01:29:41,799 --> 01:29:48,263
And I don't want anyone to see me get
near the table of a French veteran,
do you understand me?

970
01:29:48,472 --> 01:29:50,182
What do you know?

971
01:29:50,474 --> 01:29:54,561
Before he died, my brother
saw your fiancé...

972
01:29:54,686 --> 01:29:56,772
...carve three letters on the
trunk of a tree

973
01:29:56,772 --> 01:29:58,774
He had a red glove with white dots.

974
01:30:00,692 --> 01:30:03,403
A friend of his told me everything.

975
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:07,074
When one of our planes shot
at your fiancé...

976
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:11,161
...he got disgusted by it.
And just after that...

977
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:14,498
...all hell broke loose.

978
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:41,692
That day, God saved the
life of that French soldier twice.

979
01:30:43,694 --> 01:30:48,073
Suddenly, your men returned the attack...

980
01:30:48,282 --> 01:30:51,577
...they killed my brother!

981
01:30:51,994 --> 01:30:56,665
He was 23. I have come to see
his cross at the cemetery.

982
01:30:57,166 --> 01:30:59,293
I'm very sorry.

983
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:02,087
Time heals everything.

984
01:31:02,171 --> 01:31:03,964
You'll see!

985
01:31:04,965 --> 01:31:08,177
I have to come back,
or they will start to wonder.

986
01:31:17,186 --> 01:31:19,771
Then I haven't completely killed it!

987
01:31:20,063 --> 01:31:21,064
What?

988
01:31:21,064 --> 01:31:22,065
...hope!

989
01:31:37,664 --> 01:31:38,790
Now what?

990
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:39,791
Tina Lombardi.

991
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:43,796
She is going to be beheaded.
They are calling her the Officer's Killer.

992
01:31:43,796 --> 01:31:46,673
She killed Lavrouye and Thouvnel
amongst others!

993
01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:50,385
She had intended to kill Mariscal Piton.

994
01:31:56,391 --> 01:31:59,895
When I think you used a wheel
chair to get my pity...

995
01:32:30,801 --> 01:32:34,096
You are the only one i have
agreed to talk to...

996
01:32:34,263 --> 01:32:36,765
...becuse I know we are alike.

997
01:32:36,974 --> 01:32:39,476
Fine! Let's leave it.

998
01:32:44,481 --> 01:32:46,900
What I did, you could have done too.

999
01:32:46,984 --> 01:32:51,071
No, I don't think so.
I would have been too scared.

1000
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:52,072
I am not afraid.

1001
01:32:54,283 --> 01:32:57,369
Nor do I regret anything.

1002
01:32:57,661 --> 01:32:59,580
Except my hair...

1003
01:32:59,663 --> 01:33:03,876
...they will cut it before executing me.

1004
01:33:05,002 --> 01:33:09,673
I will look like Joan of Arc
when i meet my Ange.

1005
01:33:10,299 --> 01:33:12,384
Why Mariscal Piton,
what did he do?

1006
01:33:12,593 --> 01:33:15,596
It was his idea to throw out the
mutilated soldiers from the trenches.

1007
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:20,100
And why not Poincare,
he denied the pardon.

1008
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:23,187
What, you don't know?

1009
01:33:24,188 --> 01:33:27,566
He had pardoned them, the five of them.

1010
01:33:28,066 --> 01:33:29,776
It is only a license.

1011
01:33:29,902 --> 01:33:32,779
Lavrouye kept the paper...

1012
01:33:33,697 --> 01:33:35,782
And why did Lavrouye do that?

1013
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:39,786
Because pigs act like pigs!

1014
01:34:10,776 --> 01:34:14,571
But don't worry, I took care of him.

1015
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:22,496
We have carried out the same investigation.

1016
01:34:22,663 --> 01:34:25,499
Each one in her own way.

1017
01:34:26,792 --> 01:34:28,794
Looking for any Bingo veterans...

1018
01:34:29,002 --> 01:34:32,965
...I found a sick man that had healed
my Ange and the others.

1019
01:34:33,173 --> 01:34:36,885
This sick man, Philippot,
had seen one of the five.

1020
01:34:37,177 --> 01:34:39,763
A strong young man, wounded on the head

1021
01:34:39,888 --> 01:34:41,765
He was strong, wounded on the head,
he had German boots.

1022
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:47,062
According to him, he had German boots.
And was carrying a thin young man.

1023
01:34:47,271 --> 01:34:48,897
I think so...

1024
01:34:49,064 --> 01:34:50,566
...i mean, i'm sure!

1025
01:34:50,774 --> 01:34:52,901
...strong, wounded on the head.

1026
01:34:53,193 --> 01:34:56,280
his boss suggested he kept quiet.

1027
01:34:58,282 --> 01:35:01,493
You, better than anyone, can
understand the hope I felt.

1028
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:06,498
But some time later I met the one
who killed all my illusions.

1029
01:35:06,665 --> 01:35:08,375
First Sargent Favart.

1030
01:35:09,668 --> 01:35:13,964
He told me how that Thouvenel
pig murdered my Ange.

1031
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:17,176
With a single shot.

1032
01:35:21,763 --> 01:35:24,391
I also took care of him.

1033
01:35:26,393 --> 01:35:28,896
I only had one thing in mind...

1034
01:35:29,062 --> 01:35:31,982
...eliminate everyone that hurt my Ange.

1035
01:35:36,361 --> 01:35:38,780
Your Ange left this for you.

1036
01:35:57,674 --> 01:36:01,094
Revenge is useless, try to be happy.

1037
01:36:01,261 --> 01:36:06,183
And don't waste your life for me.
Ange

1038
01:36:13,482 --> 01:36:16,902
...Gordes, the one that traded
the German boots with Bastoche...

1039
01:36:17,194 --> 01:36:18,278
Was he strong?

1040
01:36:18,278 --> 01:36:19,279
Biscotte?

1041
01:36:19,488 --> 01:36:22,574
No, he wasn't athletic,
he was like you or me.

1042
01:36:22,574 --> 01:36:23,575
And, have you heard anything
about Jean de Desrochelles?

1043
01:36:24,368 --> 01:36:25,369
Desrochelles?

1044
01:36:24,701 --> 01:36:28,872
Ah yes, he was not very sociable,
he lived alone with his mother.

1045
01:36:29,081 --> 01:36:32,793
I'm sorry, I have to leave you.
I'm leaving in one hour for Venezuela.

1046
01:36:33,001 --> 01:36:35,671
Good luck Célestin.
Same to you.

1047
01:36:43,762 --> 01:36:47,099
When I think you didn't tell
me about Poincare's pardon...

1048
01:36:47,266 --> 01:36:50,394
It would only have made things worse, please understand.

1049
01:36:50,602 --> 01:36:52,980
I have a last favor to ask of you Pierre Marie.

1050
01:36:53,272 --> 01:36:55,691
I suppose it has to do with Bingo.

1051
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,986
Son of the bookshop owner Paúl Desrochelles

1052
01:36:59,278 --> 01:37:02,489
dead February of 1897.

1053
01:37:02,865 --> 01:37:05,868
Jean Desrochelles that's it!

1054
01:37:05,993 --> 01:37:08,662
Wait!. Yes in Somme.

1055
01:37:10,664 --> 01:37:13,375
Yes, fine. Thanks

1056
01:37:15,085 --> 01:37:20,799
Tell me Mr. Pierre, Tina Lombardi,
you must have known what she had planned!

1057
01:37:20,966 --> 01:37:23,302
It was wiser not to interfere with her.

1058
01:37:23,302 --> 01:37:25,471
If things get ugly,
the spy disappears ?

1059
01:37:25,596 --> 01:37:27,973
No...those who spy try not to be seen.

1060
01:37:28,474 --> 01:37:30,601
By the way I have a last clue to give to you.

1061
01:37:30,601 --> 01:37:31,602
Jean Desrochelles

1062
01:37:32,269 --> 01:37:35,981
evacuated from Somme Front on January
of the 17th, only relative, her mother.

1063
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:37,983
Widow of Paul Desrochelles.

1064
01:37:38,192 --> 01:37:41,570
Rue de la vie 22.

1065
01:37:42,196 --> 01:37:44,490
And what do you want me to do?

1066
01:37:47,493 --> 01:37:49,578
Did you want to talk to me?
Yes

1067
01:37:49,661 --> 01:37:52,080
My brother's friend, the one
i talked to you about,

1068
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:55,083
he remembered something...

1069
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:57,294
...that could be of interest to you.

1070
01:37:57,377 --> 01:38:00,798
The two French soldiers that escorted him,
that Monday morning,

1071
01:38:00,964 --> 01:38:03,801
wanted to go again through "No man's land"

1072
01:38:03,967 --> 01:38:08,472
They saw the bodies of the condemned,
one of them was in some kind of cavity

1073
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:11,600
and the two French seemed surprised.

1074
01:38:12,184 --> 01:38:14,978
I don't know if that could be useful miss?

1075
01:38:16,772 --> 01:38:18,273
Thanks.

1076
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:25,489
...tell Berney that I want to
liquidate everything by the first day of March.

1077
01:38:25,697 --> 01:38:27,574
Sell all the manure really expensive,

1078
01:38:27,699 --> 01:38:29,785
you better be careful with him.

1079
01:38:30,786 --> 01:38:32,579
Sell all the manure really expensive.

1080
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:34,873
Well, it has to be in code.

1081
01:38:49,096 --> 01:38:51,265
Mr. Pire called.

1082
01:38:51,473 --> 01:38:54,768
He didn't find anything in Saenz...
I know.

1083
01:39:04,987 --> 01:39:08,198
Hello, who is it?

1084
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:10,784
Yes miss, I remember you

1085
01:39:11,076 --> 01:39:12,494
Berney? No that doesn't sound familiar.

1086
01:39:12,661 --> 01:39:15,372
I don't know anyone with that name.

1087
01:39:15,497 --> 01:39:19,585
Benoit Notre-Dame fertilizes his lands with
his animals' manure, he didn't buy any.

1088
01:39:20,085 --> 01:39:22,379
Thanks father.

1089
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:25,966
I have to decipher that letter.

1090
01:39:26,091 --> 01:39:28,594
I'm getting close.

1091
01:40:02,586 --> 01:40:05,297
I will be...Berney...March...sell... everything.

1092
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:10,677
Say...nothing...no one

1093
01:40:10,969 --> 01:40:13,472
Benoît.

1094
01:41:01,395 --> 01:41:03,689
Excuse me sir, the farm
at the end of the world?

1095
01:41:03,772 --> 01:41:06,483
The last house, at the end of the road.

1096
01:41:24,793 --> 01:41:25,794
And what if he doesn't come?

1097
01:41:25,794 --> 01:41:29,465
He'll come! Don't worry.
Come back in two hours.

1098
01:41:59,495 --> 01:42:01,663
Hello Mathilde.

1099
01:42:01,872 --> 01:42:05,083
It is dangerous to bring back the dead.

1100
01:42:06,084 --> 01:42:08,378
When I saw your announcement in the paper

1101
01:42:08,587 --> 01:42:12,466
I knew it was a matter of time until the
gendarmes catch me.

1102
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,762
Don't worry, Ii could have killed you...

1103
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:19,598
...but i didn't.

1104
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:46,375
You're not only a thief,
but also a pyromaniac!

1105
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:48,085
I couldn't kill you.

1106
01:42:48,168 --> 01:42:51,797
When we need to kill a rabbit or a
chicken my wife takes care of it.

1107
01:42:51,797 --> 01:42:53,799
War has left me unable to do so.

1108
01:42:53,882 --> 01:42:56,385
You know what I want to hear!

1109
01:42:56,593 --> 01:42:59,471
Is Manech alive?

1110
01:43:01,473 --> 01:43:04,768
The last time I saw him he
was not well.

1111
01:43:04,977 --> 01:43:07,271
But he is stronger that he seems.

1112
01:43:16,989 --> 01:43:19,074
We have to stay together.

1113
01:43:36,091 --> 01:43:39,887
When the fighting ended, I rested to
gain back my strength.

1114
01:43:43,474 --> 01:43:45,100
What do you want?

1115
01:43:45,767 --> 01:43:49,563
Notre-Dame?

1116
01:43:52,566 --> 01:43:57,696
Then the Corsican decided to surrender.
After that they killed the welder from Paris.

1117
01:44:00,699 --> 01:44:06,163
Then your fiancé carved some letters on the trunk
of a tree and the German albatross arrived.

1118
01:44:18,801 --> 01:44:22,471
I regained my consciousness when the earth trembled.

1119
01:44:38,195 --> 01:44:41,573
I still don't understand what happened...

1120
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:44,368
...the only thing i saw was a trap door
that the projectile uncovered.

1121
01:44:59,967 --> 01:45:03,095
...For France! Attack!

1122
01:45:13,272 --> 01:45:17,401
They got into No Man's Land and
on the second line

1123
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:22,781
they were all killed by the shotguns. A few
hours later, I was awakened by some voices.

1124
01:45:23,282 --> 01:45:25,993
Oh my God!
Bastoche is dead!

1125
01:45:25,993 --> 01:45:28,162
We can't leave him here.

1126
01:45:28,203 --> 01:45:29,163
We will come for him later,
he won't go anywhere.

1127
01:45:28,078 --> 01:45:32,082
Oh Bastoche is dead

1128
01:45:32,875 --> 01:45:36,462
Look! That one is moving.

1129
01:45:36,879 --> 01:45:39,965
That one is the kid,
he is going to die too.

1130
01:45:55,981 --> 01:45:58,984
The explosion destroyed the trap door.
One of the soldiers was badly wounded.

1131
01:45:59,193 --> 01:46:04,364
Bastoche is dead!

1132
01:46:07,993 --> 01:46:10,287
We are all going to die.

1133
01:46:11,163 --> 01:46:15,501
He was Bastoche's friend, the one who
had taken the German boots.

1134
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:29,097
After eating I smoked his tobacco.

1135
01:46:29,598 --> 01:46:32,100
Then I heard more voices.

1136
01:46:33,101 --> 01:46:36,480
Oh shit!

1137
01:46:38,899 --> 01:46:40,984
Isn't that the kid!

1138
01:46:44,988 --> 01:46:47,199
What is he doing here?

1139
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:51,161
And the farmer from Dordoña, where is he?

1140
01:47:47,801 --> 01:47:51,180
Sir!

1141
01:48:12,201 --> 01:48:15,370
I'm cold!
Be calm!

1142
01:48:32,387 --> 01:48:35,390
Although he was badly wounded,

1143
01:48:35,474 --> 01:48:37,184
your fiancé wanted to live,

1144
01:48:37,392 --> 01:48:40,187
I could see it in his eyes.

1145
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:46,193
I carried him on my shoulders and
started walking by the trench.

1146
01:48:50,197 --> 01:48:53,784
He had a high fever,
i could feel it on my back.

1147
01:48:55,786 --> 01:48:58,497
He was delirious.

1148
01:48:59,081 --> 01:49:02,000
He talked about a heart beating
in his hand.

1149
01:49:07,965 --> 01:49:11,677
Private! The hospital is 500 meters ahead.

1150
01:49:11,802 --> 01:49:14,680
Do you want us to carry him on the stretcher?

1151
01:49:14,972 --> 01:49:18,475
No. If you find any Bingo sub-officer,

1152
01:49:18,684 --> 01:49:22,271
Tell him that Private Gordes went to the
hospital with Soldier Desrochelles.

1153
01:49:22,396 --> 01:49:24,064
Ok, as you wish.

1154
01:49:24,481 --> 01:49:26,275
I arrived before the explosion.

1155
01:49:26,275 --> 01:49:27,276
I have to say that the major state

1156
01:49:27,276 --> 01:49:29,987
didn't have a better idea than to place
the hospital in a hangar

1157
01:49:29,987 --> 01:49:31,780
with a blimp full of hydrogen.

1158
01:49:38,078 --> 01:49:41,582
The kid was evacuated in the convoy
that just left.

1159
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:45,085
Will he be ok?

1160
01:49:45,085 --> 01:49:46,086
The wound on the hip is not bad

1161
01:49:47,379 --> 01:49:49,798
but the pneumonia doesn't look good.

1162
01:49:51,175 --> 01:49:54,595
I listed you by the name
on your tags.

1163
01:49:54,761 --> 01:49:58,390
I don't want to know anything else.
Good luck.

1164
01:50:44,978 --> 01:50:47,773
The lever!
The lever!

1165
01:51:21,098 --> 01:51:24,393
Please!

1166
01:51:51,295 --> 01:51:54,298
Then I arrived at Berney, on foot.

1167
01:51:54,298 --> 01:51:56,884
I couldn't have known if my
wife had received the letter.

1168
01:51:56,884 --> 01:51:57,885
So everyday

1169
01:51:57,968 --> 01:52:00,596
I waited for her at the station.

1170
01:52:07,186 --> 01:52:10,397
With the money of the sale we
bought this farm.

1171
01:52:11,273 --> 01:52:13,484
The farthest we could find

1172
01:52:13,775 --> 01:52:16,403
I called it "The end of the world".

1173
01:52:28,499 --> 01:52:30,083
Goodbye.

1174
01:52:32,795 --> 01:52:38,091
It is curious, you punctured
your life line

1175
01:52:38,175 --> 01:52:39,885
Is normal

1176
01:52:40,093 --> 01:52:44,473
I died...at Bingo Crepuscule
just like your boyfriend.

1177
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:53,774
If you ever find Jean Desrochelles alive.

1178
01:52:54,274 --> 01:52:57,694
Let me know.
You know where to find me.

1179
01:53:07,788 --> 01:53:12,292
Come on in! Feel at home,
at Christmas you can enter through the chimney.

1180
01:53:12,292 --> 01:53:13,293
For Miss Mathilde

1181
01:53:14,878 --> 01:53:16,463
Ok. I'll give it to her later.

1182
01:53:17,297 --> 01:53:20,384
I think you should wake her.

1183
01:53:25,889 --> 01:53:28,475
What is going on?

1184
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:45,868
He is alive!

1185
01:53:47,202 --> 01:53:51,373
Don't move Mathilde,
whatever happens, don't move.

1186
01:53:51,582 --> 01:53:55,502
I'm on my way.
Germain Pire

1187
01:54:02,468 --> 01:54:04,887
I'm such a fool!

1188
01:54:24,865 --> 01:54:28,285
Nicer than the marten and
much faster than the gazelle.

1189
01:54:29,286 --> 01:54:32,498
He is alive and well but
he can't remember anything.

1190
01:54:32,664 --> 01:54:36,502
His amnesia is total. He even had
to learn to read and write again.

1191
01:54:37,294 --> 01:54:40,964
The psychiatrist that treated him since
the 17th doesn't have much hope.

1192
01:54:41,590 --> 01:54:44,676
But everyone knows...

1193
01:54:44,468 --> 01:54:46,970
...that there are as many amnesias
as amnesiacs.

1194
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:48,680
Where is he?

1195
01:54:50,599 --> 01:54:54,895
Orphan for the second time. He just lost
his adoptive mother

1196
01:54:57,773 --> 01:55:00,567
Pierre Marie, do you know Mr. Pire?

1197
01:55:01,193 --> 01:55:02,778
Only by reputation.

1198
01:55:02,986 --> 01:55:04,488
Nice to meet you.

1199
01:55:06,281 --> 01:55:08,867
Mathilde I'm telling you i won't
believe it until I see it.

1200
01:55:09,201 --> 01:55:10,494
With your own eyes!

1201
01:55:10,786 --> 01:55:14,873
When Jean Desrochelles was born, her mother was
40 years old and she had no other children.

1202
01:55:15,165 --> 01:55:16,875
When the gendarmes came for him...

1203
01:55:16,875 --> 01:55:18,293
...to support the front.

1204
01:55:18,293 --> 01:55:19,294
Yes.

1205
01:55:19,294 --> 01:55:21,171
She fell into a depression.

1206
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:23,799
One day she received the visit of a
mate of his son, his name was...

1207
01:55:23,799 --> 01:55:24,800
Chardolot!

1208
01:55:24,591 --> 01:55:26,468
Chardolot!

1209
01:55:26,677 --> 01:55:28,971
...sadly it was Jean

1210
01:55:29,471 --> 01:55:33,976
A bullet had reached him,
and he had been dead for hours.

1211
01:55:35,269 --> 01:55:36,770
I also have to tell you...

1212
01:55:36,895 --> 01:55:40,983
It is possible that the youngest of the
condemned stole Jean's identity.

1213
01:55:42,693 --> 01:55:45,863
Exchanging their tags.

1214
01:55:48,866 --> 01:55:51,869
I think she lost her mind the
day they called her to the hospital.

1215
01:55:52,202 --> 01:55:56,165
To tell her that her son was there.

1216
01:55:57,166 --> 01:56:00,085
He is asleep.
I'll leave you alone.

1217
01:56:19,062 --> 01:56:22,566
Good morning!
Who are you?

1218
01:56:23,567 --> 01:56:25,986
Your mother, little one.

1219
01:56:27,571 --> 01:56:30,073
I am your mother!

1220
01:56:31,074 --> 01:56:34,369
I have conducted the official investigation and
Mrs. Desrochelles died two months ago.

1221
01:56:34,369 --> 01:56:37,164
She was hit by a truck after having
a discussion with a merchant.

1222
01:56:37,372 --> 01:56:41,168
And this is not a lie.

1223
01:56:41,293 --> 01:56:42,503
We know that!

1224
01:56:46,882 --> 01:56:52,596
Mam please, calm down.
Mrs. Desrochelles didn't suffer, she died immediately.

1225
01:56:53,096 --> 01:56:55,682
I'm not crying about that.

1226
01:56:55,891 --> 01:56:58,602
I'm an idiot.

1227
01:56:58,977 --> 01:57:04,191
I didn't believe you little one.
Please forgive me!

1228
01:57:04,566 --> 01:57:08,278
I should've known.

1229
01:57:12,282 --> 01:57:15,702
What she later would call
the Millie expedition:

1230
01:57:15,994 --> 01:57:19,790
the sun, the sky and all of nature,
were on her side.

1231
01:57:19,998 --> 01:57:23,877
Flaunting her femininity,
she fixed herself as best as she could.

1232
01:57:24,086 --> 01:57:27,589
Dressed in white, the color of purity,
she painted her lips for the ocassion.

1233
01:57:27,798 --> 01:57:31,885
She outlined her eyebrows and without
rimel to extend her eyelashes.

1234
01:57:32,094 --> 01:57:36,390
She knew what would happen if
she lost her composure.

1235
01:57:54,366 --> 01:57:57,077
We told him about your visit.
We told him that a young woman

1236
01:57:57,202 --> 01:57:59,872
that he loved very much was
coming to see him.

1237
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:04,293
He asked your name and
thought it was beautiful.

1238
01:58:04,501 --> 01:58:06,795
He is waiting in the garden.

1239
02:00:08,792 --> 02:00:11,795
Does it hurt you when you walk?

1240
02:00:18,802 --> 02:00:21,263
Do you want to see what i'm doing?

1241
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:35,903
I'll let you see it when I'm done.

1242
02:00:41,867 --> 02:00:45,078
Why do you cry?

1243
02:00:49,082 --> 02:00:52,503
And Mathilde sat there with her back
straight against the chair's back.

1244
02:00:52,586 --> 02:00:56,381
With the hands on her skirt and looked at him

1245
02:00:56,590 --> 02:01:00,803
Under the harmony that enveloped them,
Under the light of the garden,

1246
02:01:01,094 --> 02:01:03,597
Mathilde looked at him,
looked at him...

1247
02:01:03,764 --> 02:01:07,768
...looked at him
