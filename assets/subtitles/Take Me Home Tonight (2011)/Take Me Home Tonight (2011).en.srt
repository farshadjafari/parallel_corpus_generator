7,757 --> 00:00:14,757


2
00:00:14,953 --> 00:00:17,953


3
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:22,153


4
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,850
Tori Frederking is back.

5
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,349
Her parents sent her to Europe for
the summer as a graduation gift...

6
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:09,349
...but she's back. Now I have 3 confirmed
sitings of her in this mall.

7
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:15,848
Matt, I don't care about Tori Frederking.
I care about her, aged to perfection.

8
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:18,247
- Daddy likie.
- Barry, you gotta focus here, man.

9
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:20,746
I'm talking about "The Frederking".

10
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,347
You have to focus, okay.

11
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:25,847
That was in the 10th grade. You got Truth
or Dared into a closet with the girl.

12
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:27,846
That was literally, seven
minutes in heaven.

13
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,446
When we got out of that closet, she told
everyone at the party that I was...

14
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:32,771
- an amazing kisser.
- An amazing kisser.

15
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:35,445
- She did!
- But, you didn't kiss her.

16
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,595
You spent seven minutes shitting your pants
and not making a move.

17
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:40,095
I know, that's what makers her so
fucking awesome.

18
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:42,995
When I got out of the closet, everyone
started ragging on me for choking.

19
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:45,594
She lied and said I was an amazing kisser.

20
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:47,693
- Pretty stellar move, huh.
- To the max.

21
00:01:47,694 --> 00:01:50,593
Oh my god. I've been hearing this story
since we shared our mothers uterus.

22
00:01:51,593 --> 00:01:55,093
Oh, and by the way, did you have the balls
to ask her out after that?

23
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:57,693
- I can't remember...
- No, but only because I never had my "in".

24
00:01:58,093 --> 00:01:59,393
- Don't do this!
- Don't do this!

25
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:01,292
- Hey!
- Hey!

26
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:02,092
- Come on.
- Come on..

27
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:04,092
- How do you always know what I'm gonna say?
- How do you always know what I'm gonna say?

28
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,092
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

29
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,591
You guys are really freaking me out
with the twins shit.

30
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:09,391
Watch and learn brother. I'm going in.

31
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:11,591
Eye of the tiger, buddy.

32
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,090
I tiger.

33
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,090
- Don't like how this looks.
- No, no good.

34
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:25,189
So uh, so you like uh, music?

35
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:28,089
I hate it!

36
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:31,088
Swing and a miss.

37
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:33,588
Oh, not the book Barry.

38
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:35,588
No, no. Not the art of war. Oh God.

39
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:38,388
You ever read Sun Tzu's "Art of War"?

40
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:42,087
I have. It's amazing.

41
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:44,087
Give you my number.

42
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:48,086
I'll loan it to you. Get back to me, at a
later date, of your choosing.

43
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:53,085
And we'll have, I don't know, a bottle of
chilled white Zin.

44
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,083
I'm free on uh, Saturday.

45
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:12,083
Call me.

46
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,583
Shermer High Class of 84.

47
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:16,582
THE FUTURE IS YOURS!

48
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:30,080
Take Me Home Tonight

49
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:15,505
Ronald Reagan: "Win one for the Gipper".

50
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:37,072
- Hey Tori.
- Hey guys.

51
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,570
Whew. This humpback whale just swims
right by me, right.

52
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,570
I've never felt so scared in my life.

53
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,870
That's when it hit me.

54
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,069
This is what I want to do with my life.
This is what I want others to do.

55
00:04:56,369 --> 00:05:00,569
See. That's why the second I got back to LA...
boom... opened Mint Travel.

56
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,068
Wait, you own it?

57
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:04,068
Yeah dude.

58
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:07,168
Went to the bank, got a loan. Pieces fell
right into place.

59
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:09,567
So what about you, I
thought you went to uh...

60
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,667
- MIT!
- MIT!

61
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:15,067
I just graduated. But uh, I hated it.

62
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:18,066
Yeah it was all like, theory and machines...
I was on this one way highway...

63
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:19,766
I was like...

64
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,566
You know... rest stop, please.

65
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,566
So this is a rest stop?

66
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:27,065
Oh yeah. This is totally temporary.

67
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:31,565
You know what you should do? You
should travel.

68
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,564
See the world. Find your hump-back whale.

69
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:35,564
You come see me, ok?

70
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:37,564
Seriously, it's the slow season right now.

71
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:41,163
Everbody's at work or school. Perfect time
for Matt to shine.

72
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:46,263
You take care man.

73
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:51,054
- Excuse me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

74
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:57,803
Hey, don't I know you?

75
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:00,003
Well I don't think so.

76
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:02,803
No, I do. I know you from somewhere.

77
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:06,802
- Oh, you went to Sherman, didn't you.
- I did!

78
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,302
- That must be it.
- Yeah, me too!

79
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:10,802
- Oh weird.
- I actually think you were in my homeroom.

80
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:12,701
What?

81
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,301
Yeah, you were the really smart kid.

82
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,801
You won the attendance award... every year.

83
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:19,800
Yeah.

84
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,800
- It's me, Tori.
- Matt Franklin.

85
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,800
I knew I knew you from somewhere... cool!

86
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:30,299
So... er... ah... what are you up too?

87
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:31,799
Well, uh...

88
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,298
I went to Duke and I
graduated, with honors.

89
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:38,298
Yeah. And then I got awarded this
internship at Drexel Burnham.

90
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:40,798
So, I moved back.

91
00:07:41,797 --> 00:07:42,997
Oh, it's an investment bank.

92
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,297
- I know what it is.
- Oh, I didn't mean to...

93
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:48,797
- No no, it's fine. I'm in the same business, so.
- Really?

94
00:07:49,796 --> 00:07:51,596
Yeah. Where do you work?

95
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:53,296
I'm at Goldman Sachs.

96
00:07:53,796 --> 00:07:57,795
Oh that's funny. I didn't know they had
an office in Los Angeles.

97
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:00,795
I know, that's weird.

98
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:04,295
A lot of people don't.

99
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:07,294
I'm in Japanese takeovers.

100
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:11,794
So, are you going to Kyle Masterson's
party tonight?

101
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,792
Uh, I don't know...

102
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:17,293
Oh. You should totally go. It was pretty
good last year.

103
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:20,093
Word is, someones gonna ride the "ball"
tonight.

104
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,792
Where are they?

105
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,292
Weird.

106
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,791
Hellooo!

107
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,791
You know what. Just take it. Yup just
take it.

108
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,290
There we go. I'll pay for it when this
jackass gets back.

109
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,690
Great! Thank you.

110
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,190
So maybe I'll see you tonight... Terry?

111
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,289
- Tori.
- Right... Tori... sorry.

112
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:59,287
<i>- Barry Nathan.
- Dude, you will not believe who was just in here, Tori Frederking.</i>

113
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:01,287
Bottom line it for me.

114
00:09:01,787 --> 00:09:03,785
I think she was flirting with me. I
honestly got that vibe.

115
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:06,586
That's highly unlikely. Can you do
better for me boss?

116
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:10,286
She said I should totally go to
Kyle Masterson's party tonight.

117
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:12,286
This is it. I finally have my "in".

118
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,585
<i>- Ah, I see.
- We're going to that party!</i>

119
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,084
I'm finally getting her phone number.

120
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:20,485
- Yeah. That's all you got for me?
- Oh yeah, what do you know about investment banking?

121
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:21,684
Nothing.

122
00:09:21,784 --> 00:09:23,484
- Currencies?
- Nothing?

123
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:25,284
That's not acceptable!

124
00:09:25,284 --> 00:09:28,983
You've got to bend a bit more here boss.
This guy just had another baby.

125
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:32,533
<i>Oh, you're trying to close a sale.
Vagina, vagina, vagina...</i>

126
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,433
Good luck. We'll pick you up at 5:00.

127
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:41,532
Fine. No I will! I'll take it out of my
own god damn salary!

128
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:47,531
No, thank you! It's a pleasure.
Such a fucking pleasure.

129
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:51,031
I'm sorry that you had to witness that.

130
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:59,030
Steven. That bastards not gonna budge.
But um, off the top of my head, this is what I'm gonna do.

131
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,029
I'm gonna knock 3 grand off.

132
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:06,529
Your boss is standing right behind you.

133
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:12,528
And I'm not buying your bullshit... Barry!
Or a sedan.

134
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:28,026
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.

135
00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:44,024
You know what?! I gave up college for
you bastards.

136
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,523
Oh shit.

137
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:53,022
Start the engine.

138
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,522
Fuck you!

139
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:02,521
So um, dad. Somebody's gonna ride
the "ball" tonight.

140
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:07,521
Darling, nobody rode that thing when I was
a kid. And nobody's gonna ride it tonight.

141
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:10,020
How's your dad doing, Barry?

142
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,020
Well, his parole got pushed back about six
months, so he's pretty upset about that.

143
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,019
I still don't understand
why they let you go.

144
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:24,518
7 years of my life, Libby. They stole
my youth.

145
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,218
Look at it this way, Barry. At least
you went for it.

146
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:32,517
You realized a goal. You rolled up your
sleeves and you applied yourself.

147
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:36,517
Well I see the traditional evenings
torture is in full swing.

148
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:40,316
Matthew, we had a deal.

149
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:45,415
You said just give me the summer to figure things out.
Well guess what. The summers over!

150
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,014
I want to hear your plan.

151
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:53,015
Dad, I guess my plan is to keep working at Suncoast until
I figure out what I really want to do with my life.

152
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:55,914
Why don't you just get an engineering job
until you figure it out?

153
00:11:56,014 --> 00:12:02,013
Honey, we just think you have such potential.
You could be anything. You could be an astronaut.

154
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,513
Oh, problem solved. I'll just be an
astronaut.

155
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:12,512
Matthew, I didn't give a quarter of my savings
to MIT so you could work at the mall.

156
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:17,011
I'll see you all in the morning. I gotta
go to work.

157
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:18,311
Matt!

158
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:23,511
- Are you OK?
- I applied to Cambridge for my masters.

159
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,410
- Holy shit! You finally did it.
- I don't wanna open it.

160
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,810
- Why not?
- Because I'm scared, dip shit.

161
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,309
- Oh... want me to open it?
- No! Matt, no! Knock it off!

162
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:36,609
No I think you do.

163
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:42,208
- Wendy, you're going to England.
- I don't know. I don't even know if I'd go.

164
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,008
Why?

165
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:50,007
I don't know if Kyle would come or not.
We took possession of the condo on Tuesday...

166
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:54,307
I mean look, he'll visit. He needs to
experience a new language. Open it!

167
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:58,806
I just applied to see if I could get in.

168
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:05,005
Okay, Wendy, you know that I hate
giving you compliments, right?

169
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:08,505
I've read your short stories. They're
amazing.

170
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,504
I know.

171
00:13:11,004 --> 00:13:15,204
Open it, open it, open it.

172
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,629
Fuckin open it!

173
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,203
- No!
- Ok!

174
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:20,003
No I'm not going to. No, not now.

175
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:22,503
No, I just want to have fun tonight.

176
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:25,103
Matt? Don't tell anyone, promise!

177
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:30,002
You can trust me. I'm a Goldman
Sachs man.

178
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,102
Good luck with that...

179
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:42,500
Ok, here we go. Nelson Mandela,
Purple Rain, windsurfing.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,800
- Windsurfing?
- Windsurfing?

181
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What am I doing?

182
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,999
I'll never get this girl.

183
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:58,498
I don't wanna hear that talk tonight. Ok?
How long do I know you?

184
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:00,998
- Since 5th grade.
- Since 5th grade, right?

185
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:07,297
You're whippin it real good now. Look at
you. You're the smartest guy I know.

186
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:10,497
The acne is all cleared up.

187
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:15,296
Hey, you've had sex now.

188
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,621
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

189
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:22,795
I'm gonna be with you, every step of
the way. You're gonna do this, Matt!

190
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,294
And you're gonna do it well.

191
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:27,494
You're gonna get this broads number.

192
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:32,194
Hey great work today guy, alright. Thank
you very much. Good job today.

193
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:34,919
Appreciate it. Bien. Mucho!

194
00:14:34,993 --> 00:14:36,493
- Hey Kyle.
- Hey.

195
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:38,493
Get these lights on. Let's see what
this looks like.

196
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:40,192
Hey watch. I'm gonna school this
bitch, man.

197
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:42,917
Guys. Get a beer. You're off the clock.
Hang out. Good job today.

198
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:48,392
Stellar! That's exactly what I'm talking
about. We having a party here or what.

199
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:49,492
Play that fuckin music, white boy.

200
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,990
Oh, if I didn't have a cast on, I'd
school you little bitches.

201
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:54,483
- Oh shit! I can't show up in this car.
- Why not?

202
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,183
Uh, the Frederking does not roll in a
kumquat.

203
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:06,481
That's my ?? bottle from MIT. Come on,
I was saving that for something special.

204
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:11,730
It's kinda special that I've never drunk
this much, this fast before.

205
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:13,730
Hey, listen. You will get through this.

206
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,730
I got fired today, ok? Fired.

207
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,729
I didn't go to screw all day and drink all
night college, like you twin bastards did.

208
00:16:25,729 --> 00:16:29,128
Tonight I'm catching up.

209
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:33,228
- Take a right at these lights up here.
- Why?

210
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:38,727
Take a right! I'm sorry.

211
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:49,226
I'm having no part of this.

212
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:53,525
Yeah Barry, I'm a little fuzzy on how we're
gonna get away with this.

213
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:59,724
I have a set of keys. I know all the alarm
codes. It's almost perfectly legitimate.

214
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:03,224
Almost.

215
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:08,323
- You just honk the horn if anything shows up.
- Roger that.

216
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:25,821
Listen Barry. We really don't want to spend
tonight in the LA county jail...

217
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:28,620
Giving some white supremacist a crying
blow job.

218
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:32,720
That's not gonna happen, Matt. There's
no way you'd cry.

219
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
Look!

220
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,719
Mike the prick bastard sales manager keeps the
keys to the 560SL in his prick bastard desk.

221
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:43,744
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

222
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:46,618
I don't know ??

223
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:49,618
We're gonna bring it back later, nobody's
gonna know the difference, okay.

224
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:52,743
I don't know. What if someone sees us?
I think there might be security cameras.

225
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:56,517
Matt, stop thinking. Ok, we'll just
do it.

226
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,942
- Shut off the alarm.
- No problem.

227
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,215
Fuck!

228
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:17,215
They changed the alarm codes, man. Those
bastards didn't trust me.

229
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:20,114
I wonder why.

230
00:18:27,713 --> 00:18:30,213
Oh my god. Holy fuck! This is great!

231
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:46,661
- You pussy! Get back in the game!
- C'mon.

232
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,458
What the hell is he doing?

233
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:21,456
Test drive?

234
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:37,954
- Holy shit!
- Stole a car! We stole a car!

235
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:41,953
Unbelievable.

236
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:48,452
I've never driven the 560SL before, Matt.

237
00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:52,452
They never let me.

238
00:19:54,952 --> 00:19:58,951
- Man... maybe you should take it back.
- No.

239
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:03,950
You need this car tonight, Matt. You
need this car tonight.

240
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,150
<i>Doreen! What's up?</i>

241
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:10,949
<i>Tell 'em Where You from.</i>

242
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:13,149
<i>Straight Outta Compton
Another crazy-ass Nigga.</i>

243
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:17,949
<i>Punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets Bigger
I'm a bad mutha fucka and you know this.</i>

244
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:22,947
<i>But the pussy ass niggas won't show this.
But I don't give a fuck, I'm a make my snaps.</i>

245
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:27,947
<i>If not from the records in the jack and the craps
Like burglary, the definition is jackin .</i>

246
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:32,447
<i>But when I'm legally armed, it's called packin.
Crazy mutha fucka from the street.</i>

247
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,946
Oh my god...

248
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,845
Think your prick bastard boss keeps a
comb in here?

249
00:20:52,944 --> 00:20:54,444
Holy...

250
00:20:55,944 --> 00:20:57,443
Are you stupid?

251
00:21:02,943 --> 00:21:07,442
- What is that finger thing?
- I don't know.

252
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:13,441
- Tastes like aspirin.
- My tongue is numb.

253
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,941
Holy shit, Barry. That was awesome.

254
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,440
My god!

255
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:32,439
- Sunshine!
- Hammer pants!

256
00:21:35,938 --> 00:21:39,938
- Hey, how's it going ??
- Did you two manage to fuck each other yet?

257
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:42,238
- What?
- What?

258
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:48,537
Oh shit, Matt. Matt Franklin. And uh, your
buddy your always hanging out with.

259
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:50,437
What's up. You never makes these
things, man.

260
00:21:50,536 --> 00:21:51,936
So that's the "ball".

261
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,136
In person, live, via satellite.

262
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:57,736
- You know it's not via anything, right?
- Yeah, I get the point.

263
00:21:57,935 --> 00:22:01,435
- I don't think he knows what "via" means.
- Yeah fuck you.

264
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:06,684
Wendy get up here. C'mon baby. Get your
hot ass up here and give me a kiss.

265
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:08,684
Be careful.

266
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:12,684
Oh, sorry.

267
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:15,983
Ok Matt. Share with everybody.

268
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:18,683
- Nothing.
- Go ahead. What? What were you saying?

269
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:20,382
This looks suicidal, man.

270
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:23,107
C'mon. You just don't like it cause the
ball represents "balls" ...

271
00:22:23,182 --> 00:22:24,182
...which you don't have.

272
00:22:24,482 --> 00:22:25,682
Kyle.

273
00:22:26,182 --> 00:22:29,082
- Oh, is this one of those "metaphors"?
- Matt!

274
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:34,181
Wendy, no. I got this one.
Yeah, yeah, it's a metaphor.

275
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:39,280
- So the "ball" is...
- Balls!

276
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,680
Good one.

277
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,679
- This is...
- That is a metaphor. I totally got him.

278
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:22,674
Oh my God. Exclamation point! Matt
Franklin.

279
00:23:23,174 --> 00:23:25,674
Do not go anywhere.

280
00:23:35,173 --> 00:23:36,673
Nice shades, asshole!

281
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:42,472
- No sign of the Frederking.
- Yup.

282
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:47,171
Man I feel like I'm in 10th grade again.
I'm gonna put these on ice.

283
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:51,170
Hey Franklin.

284
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:53,670
- Down here Hans Solo.
- Ah, fuck!

285
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,670
- Carlos, what happened to you?
- 67 times 365?

286
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,670
- You're in a wheelchair.
- Answer!

287
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:04,669
- Uh... 24455. What's up?
- I've been really lazy. Just kidding.

288
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:07,069
I got hit by a drunk driver right
after graduation, but...

289
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:10,668
"Don't cry for me Argentina" It's not so
bad, I get better parking, tons of pussy.

290
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:13,168
I mean I have stronger opinions about
hills now but, whatever.

291
00:24:14,168 --> 00:24:16,167
So what have you doing, building
jet packs?

292
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:20,067
- Uh, no, I work at Goldman Sachs.
- No you don't! No way you work there!

293
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,667
No I do. I work in Asian takeovers.

294
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:26,766
That's funny, cause you know where I
work? Goldman fucking Sachs.

295
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:29,091
- You don't work there!
- You work at Goldman Sachs?

296
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:32,465
You bet your legs I do. Think I'm gonna
let this shit hold me back?

297
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:37,665
You don't need to walk to speculate currencies.
I said "You don't need to walk to speculate currencies"!

298
00:24:38,864 --> 00:24:40,864
I'm doing what I want. I'm following
my dream.

299
00:24:41,164 --> 00:24:43,164
- Eat it.
- I thought you wanted to play baseball!

300
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:47,663
- Fuck you, Franklin!
- Ah, look. Do you know Tori Frederking?

301
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:51,463
- Yeah, I know her.
- Well if you see her, could you show her this...

302
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:53,062
... and tell her I work at Goldman
Sachs.

303
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:55,162
Wow, that's pathetic dude.

304
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,162
Probably not gonna work either. We
don't have an LA office.

305
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,662
Everybody knows that, who has
half a sack. Spelled with a "k".

306
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:03,661
- Well just don't rat me out.
- Yeah I'll think about it.

307
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:06,661
If I'm not gettin laid. When I'm gettin
laid I don't think about much else.

308
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:10,260
Anyway, kinda gettin bummed out talking
to you. What do you do, anyway?

309
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,660
- I thought you went to MIT.
- I work at Suncoast video.

310
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:19,159
Wow... Congratulations? Mom and dad
must be psyched.

311
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,659
I'm gonna get outta here. Check this
out, "moon walk".

312
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,658
Will you guys move. I'm trying to
fucking party here.

313
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:30,658
And it's Kyles crazy grandma, standing there.
And she says, listen to this...

314
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:36,157
I can't tell if your fucking or drowning.
But neither one is letting me get any sleep.

315
00:25:38,657 --> 00:25:40,656
So embarrassing.

316
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:44,156
So, uh, the next day, my dad pulls me
aside...

317
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:47,081
...and he offers to help with the
down payment on a condo.

318
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:52,155
Yeah, so I guess we screwed ourselves
into the market.

319
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:56,154
"Literally".

320
00:26:01,154 --> 00:26:05,353
Yeah, anyway so we're moving in on Tuesday, and...
but it's great cause there's a hot tub...

321
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:26,350
Hi. I can't handle this right now. I want
to do some of the coke.

322
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:27,875
What do you mean you can't handle this?

323
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,750
- I want to do the coke!
- No, what can't you handle?

324
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:35,049
- Not doing the coke!
- Ok, Barry, we're not cocaine people.

325
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:39,748
A, My dad's a cop. B, I'm defining my
gray area...

326
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:42,273
...which I'm pretty sure doesn't include
hard narcotics.

327
00:26:42,348 --> 00:26:44,148
- Give me the bag.
- No.

328
00:26:44,248 --> 00:26:46,148
Give me the bag or you don't get
the car keys.

329
00:26:49,547 --> 00:26:52,847
Okay, just take it easy "Scarf ace."

330
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:55,147
This one here is an alarm...

331
00:27:37,141 --> 00:27:42,140
- Tori Frederking?
- Rick Herrington. Oh my god.

332
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,140
- How are you?
- I'm good... wow... oh.

333
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:53,639
Hey, how are you?

334
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,638
What's up man? Good to see you.

335
00:27:57,138 --> 00:28:01,138
Dude and I we're just packing up.
Moving in together next week.

336
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,137
- We got a condo.
- Yeah, baby tell them the story.

337
00:28:05,237 --> 00:28:08,837
We're here 4th of July. My family always has
the big party here, and the house is packed...

338
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,662
...with relatives and so there's no place
for us too...

339
00:28:12,136 --> 00:28:14,136
- I know.
- You know?

340
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:16,736
So we come down to the pool, where
it's always kinda quiet, right.

341
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:22,635
- You know, getting into it, water splashing...
- So embarrassing.

342
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:27,634
A flotation ring hits me in the head. And
I'm like mid pump, its like... what?

343
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:32,434
And I look and it's my crazy grandmother
and she says to me...

344
00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:37,633
...I can't tell if you're fucking or drowning,
but neither one is letting us get any sleep.

345
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:41,633
Next day, dad pulls us aside and offers
to help with a down payment on the condo.

346
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:45,732
Yeah so I guess we screwed ourselves
into the market.

347
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,631
That's good.

348
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:57,431
Hey, um, Matt you remember Tori.

349
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,030
Whoa, yes... weird.

350
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,630
- How's it going? Mark?
- Oh, heh heh...

351
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,130
Very funny.

352
00:29:05,629 --> 00:29:07,129
It's Matt.

353
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:12,129
Is my name.

354
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:19,628
So, high school again, huh?
Freaky Deeky.

355
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:23,127
How's that?

356
00:29:28,127 --> 00:29:34,626
Wow, this breeze is great. It's like,
wind surfing weather, you know.

357
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:38,125
I tell you, I'd love to be out on
my board tonight.

358
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:42,125
- You're into wind surfing?
- Hell yeah!

359
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:45,624
- Big time, you?
- No, I'm not!

360
00:29:47,124 --> 00:29:50,424
- Really?
- No!

361
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:57,623
Yeah, no, well... cause wind?! Fuck that!

362
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:03,422
Um, I should probably go check to make
sure we're not running out of soda, inside.

363
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:07,621
- So I'll see you guys later.
- Good seeing you.

364
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:09,621
See ya.

365
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:14,620
- You know it's funny...
- Hey, you ever find yourself in Paris?

366
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,820
- Uh, yeah...
- Yeah?

367
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:24,619
There's a lovely bistro right around
the corner from the Sorbonne, called the...

368
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,119
It's chevre chaud is impeccable.

369
00:30:31,118 --> 00:30:34,318
We are doing cocaine. Ok.

370
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:42,417
Looks so easy in the movies.

371
00:30:42,617 --> 00:30:48,116
Let's do this. You're gonna do this, ok.
You're gonna feel unbelievable.

372
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:54,315
Nostrils ready. We're doing this. Ok.

373
00:31:15,113 --> 00:31:16,612
Nice!

374
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,612
Great.

375
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,111
I get stuck with a bag of shit.

376
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:35,936
Blammo!

377
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:11,605
Hey, you're hot!

378
00:32:14,105 --> 00:32:17,904
I'm growling at you! Did you hear me. I
was growling at you like a lion.

379
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:19,729
A lion in the jungle.

380
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:22,404
I'm Barry.

381
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:26,403
Confirmation, yeah you're hot!

382
00:32:26,703 --> 00:32:29,803

- Hello.

383
00:32:32,102 --> 00:32:33,602
Show them the ??

384
00:32:35,102 --> 00:32:38,602
You are tall. But I can still hear you.

385
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:43,901
Whoa, you're gonna hurt somebody man.
You're gonna take someones eye out.

386
00:32:44,101 --> 00:32:47,600
- That guy is my boyfriend.
- Hope he screws better than he dances.

387
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,599
Oh shit he's about to do the splits. I
can see it in his eyes. There he goes.

388
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:59,099
He's got no testes left.
He's got no testes left.

389
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,598
Who's got a watermelon?

390
00:33:03,098 --> 00:33:05,498
Yo, go find your own date.

391
00:33:06,098 --> 00:33:09,998
I got my own date. I think that
you used to know her.

392
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:22,596
What's up? Want to dance?
Let's see what you got, boy!

393
00:33:29,095 --> 00:33:34,494
Take a good look around you. Everything
changes, but "nothing" changes.

394
00:33:34,594 --> 00:33:36,094
Yeah, I hear you brother.

395
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:44,593
So I been getting into this whole wine thing lately.
Tasting it and talking about it.

396
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:49,092
We should go down to my dads boat and uh,
do a little sampling.

397
00:33:49,492 --> 00:33:52,892
Oh hey... there you are.

398
00:33:53,592 --> 00:33:59,091
Matt, hello? When are you
gonna show me that thing?

399
00:33:59,191 --> 00:34:02,890
Right, the uh, waterfall. On the other
side of the patio.

400
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:07,015
- I was gonna show you that.
- I love waterfalls. I'll just be back in a bit.

401
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:19,588
- How do you like that?
- That was awesome. So good. I got goose bumps.

402
00:34:21,088 --> 00:34:23,588
So...

403
00:34:24,088 --> 00:34:26,587
This waterfall's... you know...

404
00:34:27,087 --> 00:34:28,587
There's no waterfalls.

405
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:30,587
I know.

406
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:36,786
- Have you seen Niagara?
- No I haven't. Have you?

407
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:40,586
No.

408
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:44,585
Hey Tori, uh...

409
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:49,084
- Have you...
- Hey! Everybody.

410
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:52,709
Barry Nathan and Tyler Jones are
having a dance off.

411
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:02,583
But I am, my ridiculously dressed friend.
I am in downtown tokyo, I am the samurai dance master...

412
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,182
... and I'm gonna dance your dummy playing
ass into the ground.

413
00:35:05,207 --> 00:35:06,707
Yo, DJ... hit it!

414
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,080
Wow, that's amazing.

415
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:38,578
That's all you got?

416
00:36:28,072 --> 00:36:31,071
You had enough? You had enough?

417
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,570
Fuckin a, Barry.

418
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,070
I got you bitch.

419
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:49,069
- C'mon. Chill out, alright?
- Cool, cool, cool.

420
00:36:54,068 --> 00:36:59,368
- C'mon you guys. We are adults.
- Fine, fine, fine. It's over.

421
00:36:59,393 --> 00:37:01,693
Don't do it again, white boy. Here.

422
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:05,567
God damn it, Barry.

423
00:37:10,566 --> 00:37:15,565
- Are you OK? Oh my god she's choking.
- Somebody help her.

424
00:37:17,065 --> 00:37:21,065
I got her. I got you. Breathe...
breathe...

425
00:37:21,265 --> 00:37:23,564
Get off her.

426
00:37:24,064 --> 00:37:27,064
- You're gonna pull through. C'mon! Breathe!
- What are you doing?

427
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:32,063
- I'm giving you the Heimlich.
- I wasn't choking. She was.

428
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,061
I'm such a jackass. I'm sorry.

429
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:51,861
I suck at this. I'm... I'm... What
am I doing? I'm sorry!

430
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,660
You're awesome. I'm trying so hard, and
I... it's...

431
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,860
Here's the thing. You were my high
school crush, by the way.

432
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,059
And I just physically assaulted you in
front of a bunch of people.

433
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,559
I just hit rock bottom. So... don't
mind me.

434
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:07,357
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

435
00:38:07,382 --> 00:38:09,882
I don't see how it could get any worse.
Nope! Got it!

436
00:38:09,907 --> 00:38:13,907
I could ask you to dance and, chuck
my drink in your face...

437
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:17,432
And twirl you into the fucking wall.
I'll do it.

438
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:19,557
I'm sorry... I was...

439
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:23,682
Oh I love this song!

440
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,556
I love this song.

441
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:35,355
- Do you wanna... do you wanna dance?
- Sure!

442
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:37,554
Are you insured?

443
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:41,679
I will dance with you if you promise,
no twirling.

444
00:38:41,854 --> 00:38:43,654
Right, I promise. I'll go slow.

445
00:39:06,551 --> 00:39:10,550
- I was wondering, uh... if I could get your phone...
- What?

446
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:17,549
I was wondering if I could...
I could, uh...

447
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:23,549
I could always tell in high school, um,
that you were gonna land on your feet.

448
00:39:27,648 --> 00:39:29,648
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could get
your attention please.

449
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:38,146
First of all I want to say thank you to
everybody for chillin with me...

450
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:39,871
...on my very last labor day party.

451
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:46,445
You know nothings changed it
seems like since we graduated.

452
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,970
Trevor, talking to you. What's up
with that fucking ear ring, dude?

453
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:53,545
We are changing, and we're moving on.

454
00:39:54,045 --> 00:40:00,744
We're going our separate ways. And some of
us are going our separate ways... together.

455
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:02,043
You all know Wendy.

456
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:05,443
- Wendy Franklin here. Honey get on up here.
- What are you doing?

457
00:40:05,543 --> 00:40:07,043
What is he doing?

458
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,442
I think that she is... one hell of
a chick.

459
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:21,041
Because she turned a lump of coal like me
into a diamond.

460
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:25,041
From all the pressure she put me under. Oh!

461
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,540
Oh, wait. There's something I got here.

462
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,539
- Oh my god!
- Oh my god!

463
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,038
Wendy, will you marry me?

464
00:40:47,038 --> 00:40:50,537
- No!
- Hell yeah!

465
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:56,036
Yes, yes I will.

466
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:24,033
Oh man, come on!

467
00:41:55,029 --> 00:41:56,529
- Hey.
- Hey!

468
00:41:57,028 --> 00:41:58,728
Look, I know everyone's making fun of you.

469
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:01,953
But I just want to say I really loved
what you did out there tonight.

470
00:42:02,028 --> 00:42:09,527
- Who's making fun of me?
- Your dance was cool. It was like anti-dancing.

471
00:42:12,026 --> 00:42:15,026
It was like a big screw you to all them
conformist assholes.

472
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:16,251
I'm glad you liked it.

473
00:42:17,026 --> 00:42:20,326
You didn't give a shit about any of
their shit, you know.

474
00:42:21,025 --> 00:42:23,025
Did you want to get naked?

475
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:30,024
Wow, that was fast. For me I get naked
all the time.

476
00:42:34,024 --> 00:42:36,023
Come find me later.

477
00:42:48,022 --> 00:42:50,022
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

478
00:42:52,021 --> 00:42:54,221
- I don't wanna say this, but I really feel...
- Then don't!

479
00:42:54,521 --> 00:42:56,021
Don't marry him.

480
00:42:56,021 --> 00:42:58,520
- Oh, christ.
- The two of you...

481
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:02,020
It's like you don't fit. I don't think
he can make you happy.

482
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,220
Well I already am happy, so your wrong
so leave me alone.

483
00:43:05,245 --> 00:43:07,118
Then why don't you open that envelope
from Cambridge?

484
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,619
- Because I hate rejection.
- Come on. You know you got in!

485
00:43:10,644 --> 00:43:13,144
And you now he doesn't want you to go.
He's already holding you back.

486
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,718
Kyle would support any decision that I
wanted to make as long as I was happy.

487
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:17,543
Ok then, why didn't you tell him
you applied?

488
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:20,918
I mean he's gonna be your husband, right?
Aren't you supposed to be honest with him?

489
00:43:21,017 --> 00:43:24,917
Oh you're lecturing me about honesty,
Mister "Goldman Sachs"?

490
00:43:25,017 --> 00:43:27,017
The only reason you're saying all this
stuff is because you're jealous.

491
00:43:27,217 --> 00:43:29,916
- You're jealous that I have a life and you don't!
- You're not gonna have a life.

492
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,941
You're just supporting Kyle's life.

493
00:43:32,016 --> 00:43:34,416
That's why you said yes, right? So it
would all be wrapped up in a little bow.

494
00:43:34,441 --> 00:43:35,941
Wendy, marriage is a big life decision.

495
00:43:36,015 --> 00:43:39,215
Oh, big life decisions? At least I'm making
some asshole.

496
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,940
You're so scared, you can't
choose anything.

497
00:43:41,015 --> 00:43:44,814
Not a girl, not a job... anything.
And you're just gonna sit there in your little...

498
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:46,939
...smarty pants fantasy bubble,
dreaming about...

499
00:43:47,014 --> 00:43:49,714
Tori Frederking when you know that she's
unobtainable.

500
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:50,939
That's not true.

501
00:43:51,014 --> 00:43:54,813
You can't get her and you know it. So
there's really no risk at all, is there?

502
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:56,338
It's bullshit, Matt and you know it!

503
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:03,512
I was wrong. You're gonna look great
in an apron.

504
00:44:26,009 --> 00:44:28,309
So you know how I've always been into
fashion.

505
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,908
Well I am in a van to New York.

506
00:44:31,008 --> 00:44:34,508
- Doesn't that so blow your mind?
- Totally.

507
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:38,507
Let's go to the Drexel party. Why are
we still hanging out with the Sachs?

508
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:42,707
Some of us weren't offered full time positions.
I have some serious networking to do.

509
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:46,606
This is so totally not me, ok. I totally
think we can work something out.

510
00:44:46,631 --> 00:44:48,331
Just for tonight.

511
00:44:50,006 --> 00:44:51,006
- Shelly!
- Yeah?

512
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,805
I gotta go.

513
00:44:53,005 --> 00:44:55,505
I totally don't know what I'm talking
about.

514
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:15,502
Is that your car?

515
00:45:17,502 --> 00:45:19,002
This is the so cherry.

516
00:45:20,002 --> 00:45:22,901
- You make enough money for a car like this?
- Well, yeah...

517
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:32,500
- Nobody stopped me when I drove it off the lot.
- Matt! Matt! Matt!

518
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,499
This is Barry... the dancer.

519
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:44,499
So are you guys going to that party in
Beverly Hills?

520
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:48,498
Uh, yeah, we're thinking about it. You?

521
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:54,497
- Well yeah!
- Where is that party again?

522
00:45:54,997 --> 00:45:58,497
Well you know what. I know the way so
I should just, ride with you.

523
00:45:58,498 --> 00:46:01,496
- What?
- Oh my god, you slut.

524
00:46:03,996 --> 00:46:06,996
- Oh my god, you slut.
- Look, you gotta ride with her friends.

525
00:46:06,996 --> 00:46:12,495
- Really? Ok.
- Are you smoking now?

526
00:46:12,995 --> 00:46:16,794
When it rains it pours. Am I right,
brother?

527
00:46:17,994 --> 00:46:24,493
Come on, punch it up. Punch. And squeeze real tight.
And then the finger comes up. Bam!

528
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:26,493
- And then you go like this.
- Hey, get off me.

529
00:46:29,993 --> 00:46:35,492
- Hey, I guess I'm riding with you guys.
- Uh, I don't know.

530
00:46:36,592 --> 00:46:38,992
I have cocaine on me.

531
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:42,491
- Can I ride in the back with you Barry?
- Yeah.

532
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:49,790
Well this will be fun. It will be all bankers
at this party, so we will know a ton of people.

533
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:52,815
Oh, great.

534
00:47:24,986 --> 00:47:27,685
- It's a great night for this, huh?
- Yeah.

535
00:47:31,985 --> 00:47:35,484
So this party is at my boss, Pete Bering's
house.

536
00:47:35,984 --> 00:47:38,283
Unfortunately he's a bit of a perve.

537
00:47:38,508 --> 00:47:42,708
Swear to god the only reason I got offered
a full time position at Drexel...

538
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:43,933
... is cause he wants to see my boobs.

539
00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:46,883
- Really?
- Uh huh.

540
00:47:46,983 --> 00:47:50,182
- What about your friends boobs?
- Well, he's already seen them.

541
00:47:50,182 --> 00:47:51,482
- Really? Wow!
- Uh, huh.

542
00:47:51,982 --> 00:47:56,481
You see that's the problem. Boob power
recedes once revealed.

543
00:47:56,981 --> 00:48:00,980
He hasn't and won't see mine, so I retain
the boob power.

544
00:48:01,005 --> 00:48:02,205
Eye contact, Matt.

545
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,980
You know we always know when you guys
look.

546
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,779
- Not always.
- No, we do, it's true!

547
00:48:11,804 --> 00:48:16,404
- Go ahead, give it a shot. I'll look away.
- Okay.

548
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:21,478
- Now.
- Wow! That, whoa!

549
00:48:21,978 --> 00:48:24,478
- That was good.
- Pretty good?

550
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:28,477
- Now.
- Wow, that's crazy.

551
00:48:28,977 --> 00:48:31,877
I don't know. I think maybe you're
just getting lucky.

552
00:48:31,977 --> 00:48:35,476
- Oh really? Try it again, big shot.
- Okay.

553
00:48:36,476 --> 00:48:39,175
- Now.
- Wow, that is a gift!

554
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:43,575
That's unbelievable. Best of seven?

555
00:49:08,972 --> 00:49:10,972
Holy shit, did you see that car?

556
00:49:39,968 --> 00:49:41,968
How are you guys?

557
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:51,966
- It'll cause the stock to rally.
- But I'm worried about them sustaining these margins.

558
00:49:51,966 --> 00:49:54,466
- The rumors about this Russian oil field.
- It's going to happen because it's got momentum.

559
00:49:54,966 --> 00:49:58,465
But you can't put momentum on a balance sheet.
I mean, their numbers are embarrassing.

560
00:49:58,465 --> 00:50:02,665
That's irrelevant. We'll float some junk and then
they can buy a company with a balance sheet...

561
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,464
...that's not absolute shit.

562
00:50:04,465 --> 00:50:08,264
Walter, your not drinking. I warned you
about that. Excuse me.

563
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:09,964
- Hello Tori.
- Hey Mr. Bering.

564
00:50:10,164 --> 00:50:15,663
Hey, it's Pete. Please. I was really hoping
you'd come. Walk with me. Excuse me.

565
00:50:15,963 --> 00:50:18,863
- I think Beth's here.
- Didn't notice.

566
00:50:18,963 --> 00:50:25,462
Listen Tori. I was hoping to get your opinion on
the actualities of that Baltic Sterling nonsense.

567
00:50:26,962 --> 00:50:32,961
Would you mind coming upstairs. Take a
look at that report. Decode it for me.

568
00:50:32,961 --> 00:50:37,060
It's Pete, right? Pete Bering. Matt
Franklin. Good to see you again.

569
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,760
- I'm sorry, have we met?
- Have we met?

570
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:54,458
- Matt's over at Goldman Sachs.
- Guilty, as charged.

571
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:57,757
So, Matt. Who do you work under
over there?

572
00:50:57,782 --> 00:50:58,982
Oh, well... I'm not at liberty to say.

573
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:03,457
- Why not?
- We pride ourselves on being a discreet firm.

574
00:51:03,957 --> 00:51:06,457
Our policy is don't discuss business.

575
00:51:06,956 --> 00:51:09,156
Really. Matt doesn't seem like a
Goldman Sachs man to me, Tori.

576
00:51:09,181 --> 00:51:12,181
Most of those blowhards can't shut up
about work.

577
00:51:13,956 --> 00:51:16,655
Seriously, Matt, tell me the department,
let me do the math.

578
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,880
I know a lot of people over there.

579
00:51:18,955 --> 00:51:24,454
- What department?
- Yeah Matt. What...do...you...do?

580
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:29,453
Excuse me.

581
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:33,453
Do you guys know Yen? I mean...

582
00:51:34,953 --> 00:51:42,951
Say a Yen gets uh transferred from Mr.
Nariyada's bank, in Tokyo...

583
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:46,376
...on a Monday and it lands in Rome.

584
00:51:47,551 --> 00:51:53,950
So what's .467 * 32? 149.5 Lira, right?

585
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:56,749
Wam, Mr. Roma takes that, flips it over to
Mr. Queen Elizabeth...

586
00:51:56,774 --> 00:52:02,774
...so what's 149.5 divided by 22.3?
Six pounds, British Sterling and 78 pence, right?

587
00:52:02,949 --> 00:52:06,548
Wam! He takes it, flips it over to Mr. USA
today before opening bell...

588
00:52:06,573 --> 00:52:11,073
So what's 6.78 divided by 1.68? It's 3.99
big bad dream bags.

589
00:52:11,098 --> 00:52:13,598
And guess who Mr. Yankee Doodle Dandy wires
it to over the international date line...

590
00:52:13,623 --> 00:52:15,723
Mr. Nariyada. How much is that Yen worth
now?

591
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:19,848
1.012! 1.2 percent more in one day.
1.2 percent times 365 days...

592
00:52:19,873 --> 00:52:23,973
... and I'll do the math. That's a lot
of fuckin blow fish.

593
00:52:23,998 --> 00:52:26,698
So that's what I do, Pete.

594
00:52:27,823 --> 00:52:30,823
Currencies, Franklin?

595
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:35,745
- Yeah Carlos.
- You two in the same division?

596
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:38,744
Franklin? Matt?

597
00:52:42,944 --> 00:52:47,343
I'm just fucking with you. Matt's a star man.
It's like having rain man on the floor.

598
00:52:47,368 --> 00:52:49,368
Except you can touch him and shit.

599
00:52:49,943 --> 00:52:52,443
In fact, he just got promoted.

600
00:52:52,943 --> 00:52:56,442
That's right. I didn't want to say
anything. Guy above me got fired.

601
00:52:56,942 --> 00:52:59,942
Some girl asked him for a raise and he
asked for a hand job.

602
00:53:00,942 --> 00:53:03,441
I guess he's the one
that got the raise, huh.

603
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:06,241
Sounds like my kind of guy.

604
00:53:07,441 --> 00:53:11,740
- She took him for about 8 Mil.
- Oh.

605
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,440
Supreme Court takes sexual harassment
very, very seriously these days.

606
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,939
It's about time, huh?

607
00:53:18,939 --> 00:53:23,439
Yes, yes, it is about time.

608
00:53:23,939 --> 00:53:27,938
Well. Great meeting you, Matt. I have
to go make the rounds.

609
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:31,438
You guys have fun.

610
00:53:31,937 --> 00:53:34,437
Holy shit, that was amazing.

611
00:54:02,933 --> 00:54:05,233
Stay cool. Sexy redhead.

612
00:54:08,933 --> 00:54:14,432
- Trish Anderson.
- Barry Nathan.

613
00:54:15,932 --> 00:54:22,832
- Is it snowing?
- I think it's like 65 degrees outside.

614
00:54:22,931 --> 00:54:26,930
- No I mean are you holding?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

615
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,929
- You want to have fun little?
- Yes I do!

616
00:54:32,929 --> 00:54:37,929
- Come with me.
- Really? Oh my god.

617
00:54:42,928 --> 00:54:44,928
Oh my god.

618
00:54:45,928 --> 00:54:47,428
Oops, I did yours.

619
00:54:50,927 --> 00:54:54,927
- Jesus christ, man.
- Oh, it's my friend Frances. It's ok though. Isn't it?

620
00:54:57,926 --> 00:54:59,926
Ok, come on in man.

621
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:02,726
You want any, future man?

622
00:55:03,126 --> 00:55:06,025
Come a little closer, Barry Nathan.

623
00:55:14,924 --> 00:55:16,424
Beverly Hills.

624
00:55:28,922 --> 00:55:35,821
Hey Frances, um... do me a favor. Just
take yours to go. Ok pal? Just go!

625
00:55:35,921 --> 00:55:37,921
- Get the hell outta here.
- He doesn't want any of that.

626
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:39,921
He doesn't?

627
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:44,920
- What the hell does Frances want?
- He wants to watch.

628
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,219
- I don't...
- He won't bother us. Just let him watch.

629
00:55:52,919 --> 00:55:55,519
- Ok, um... who is this Frances person?
- It's non-negotiable!

630
00:56:06,917 --> 00:56:08,917
I'm going to try this.

631
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:15,416
What do you think this house cost him?

632
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:19,915
- Drug habit. Kids in therapy.
- ?? the view.

633
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:24,415
But you like it, right?

634
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:30,714
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Drexel's great.
It's a real opportunity for me.

635
00:56:30,914 --> 00:56:36,413
I'll get stock options, great benefits.
You know it's really a wonderful...

636
00:56:37,913 --> 00:56:39,913
What?

637
00:56:40,913 --> 00:56:42,912
I hate it!

638
00:56:44,912 --> 00:56:47,412
I hate my job!

639
00:56:48,912 --> 00:56:55,111
Wow, I've never said that out loud
before. But I do, I hate it. I do!

640
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:57,711
I hate all of this.

641
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:58,410
- Really?
- Hate it!

642
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,410
- Gotcha.
- Crazy right?

643
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:03,410
I just keep thinking, do I really want
to do this?

644
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:07,409
- Is this what I want to do with my life?
- Is it?

645
00:57:07,909 --> 00:57:12,909
I do not know, that's the thing.
I'm so confused and I really, really don't know.

646
00:57:13,908 --> 00:57:19,708
I'm sorry this must sound ridiculous to you.
You're obviously very smart at your job.

647
00:57:19,908 --> 00:57:21,407
No, no, Tori. Whoa!

648
00:57:21,907 --> 00:57:25,307
Are you kidding me? I got this thing that
I know I'm good at.

649
00:57:25,332 --> 00:57:26,532
And everyone in my life...

650
00:57:27,907 --> 00:57:31,406
...expects me to turn it into a career.

651
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,406
I can't stand it.

652
00:57:33,906 --> 00:57:37,905
- I know. I feel the exact same way every day.
- And then there's no turning back!

653
00:57:37,905 --> 00:57:41,805
- It's gonna be like uh, family and mortgage.
- I know!

654
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:42,904
- There's no way to quit.
- Yes!

655
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:44,129
- It's a trap!
- It's a trap!

656
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:52,403
God, that sounds so messed up.

657
00:57:55,903 --> 00:57:58,403
Have you ever played the penis game?

658
00:57:59,902 --> 00:58:03,402
I'm not prepared to reveal that
information, thank you.

659
00:58:03,902 --> 00:58:07,401
No, it's a real game. I say the word
"penis" like really quiet...

660
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,901
And then you say it just a little bit louder.
Then I say it a little bit louder than that...

661
00:58:11,926 --> 00:58:13,126
And the first to stop saying it, loses.

662
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:15,400
<i>Are you ready? Is easy. Penis</i>

663
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,400
I don't know...

664
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,399
Tori trust me. There is nothing more fun than
a job you don't give a shit about losing.

665
00:58:23,899 --> 00:58:25,399
Penis.

666
00:58:25,899 --> 00:58:28,399
- Penis.
- Penis.

667
00:58:28,424 --> 00:58:30,424
- Penis!
- Penis!

668
00:58:30,449 --> 00:58:31,949
- Penis!!
- Penis!!

669
00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:34,299
- PENIS!!!
- PENIS!!!

670
00:58:37,897 --> 00:58:39,897
Let's call it a tie.

671
00:58:42,897 --> 00:58:46,396
- Chris, christ, you're out of control, lady.
- Yeah, fuck you too!

672
00:58:46,896 --> 00:58:48,696
- What? Sorry.
- Don't apologize to me.

673
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:49,895
What do you think I am, a child?

674
00:58:49,896 --> 00:58:52,895
- Fuck you then.
- Yeah, that's better.

675
00:58:54,895 --> 00:58:57,595
I'm gonna swallow you whole... son.

676
00:58:57,895 --> 00:59:00,894
If you don't mind, that would be
fantastic.

677
00:59:01,894 --> 00:59:08,593
I mean, um... suck my dick... bitch?

678
00:59:08,893 --> 00:59:11,393
Yeah. That's it!

679
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:20,892
I'm gonna hit it with you, Barry Nathan.

680
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,391
Wait a minute!

681
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:34,790
- Hey, what the hell is he doing?
- Oh he's getting a better angle.

682
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:37,390
- Ok, he can't come near me!
- How close?

683
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,889
- I don't want him touching me at all.
- ??

684
00:59:42,889 --> 00:59:44,889
- Let me outta here!
- What, you don't like this?

685
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:46,388
Shit no!

686
00:59:48,888 --> 00:59:51,788
- You crazy bitch.
- Yeah c'mon. Shout at me Barry!

687
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:55,887
I'll kill you!

688
01:00:01,886 --> 01:00:06,285
People... freaky shit! I didn't go to
college, ok!

689
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:11,610
You people crossed the line here today!
This is entrapment! No thank you!

690
01:00:15,885 --> 01:00:18,384
God it's like, who lives in this
neighborhood, right?

691
01:00:18,884 --> 01:00:20,884
Actually, hang on a sec.

692
01:00:24,883 --> 01:00:27,083
How do you feel about a
little yard hopping?

693
01:00:27,883 --> 01:00:30,883
- I don't know.
- C'mon, let's get out of here.

694
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,882
- Oh my god!
- Shah.

695
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:41,881
I don't think anyone's home.

696
01:00:42,881 --> 01:00:44,381
Really?

697
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:46,481
Welcome to your new house.

698
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:51,080
How are you like this? No one else I
work with is this much fun.

699
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,105
I can't believe you're a banker.

700
01:00:54,879 --> 01:00:56,379
Me neither...

701
01:00:59,879 --> 01:01:02,378
- Oh shit.
- What?

702
01:01:02,878 --> 01:01:04,378
Oh yeah.

703
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:06,378
- No.
- Yeah.

704
01:01:07,378 --> 01:01:10,377
- We're doing this.
- I am not getting on that thing.

705
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:13,777
That was really smooth.

706
01:01:13,877 --> 01:01:15,577
- Come on.
- No, I'm not.

707
01:01:15,877 --> 01:01:18,376
- I know you want to.
- I'll watch safely from down here.

708
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:24,176
Tori tonight we're not thinking.
We're doing.

709
01:01:36,874 --> 01:01:42,373
This is just coming back to me. Do you
remember when we played Truth or Dare?

710
01:01:42,873 --> 01:01:46,873
I think you and I got dared into 7 minutes
in heaven.

711
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:51,372
No doesn't ring a bell.

712
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:58,871
- But maybe if we play it again...
- You want to play "Truth or Dare"?

713
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:04,271
- Truth or Dare?
- Ok. Wow, uh, truth.

714
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:09,370
If I was your high school crush, how
come you never asked me out?

715
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:16,369
- You know... I never had my "in".
- Your "in"?

716
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:21,568
Yeah... you know, the right moment. You
know the perfect confluence of events.

717
01:02:27,867 --> 01:02:29,367
No.

718
01:02:29,867 --> 01:02:35,266
I've been telling myself that since high
school. And it's bullshit.

719
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:38,291
I had plenty of opportunities to ask
you out.

720
01:02:38,866 --> 01:02:42,365
I was afraid.

721
01:02:43,865 --> 01:02:45,365
Truth.

722
01:02:45,865 --> 01:02:51,364
If I had asked you out in high school,
would you have said yes?

723
01:02:53,864 --> 01:02:58,363
That's not fair. If I had known then what
I know now...

724
01:02:58,863 --> 01:03:02,363
Tori... come on.

725
01:03:04,862 --> 01:03:08,362
No. I probably wouldn't have said yes.

726
01:03:12,861 --> 01:03:15,361
Why do you look so relieved?

727
01:03:15,861 --> 01:03:22,360
Because I am! My biggest regret is not having
the balls to ask you out in high school.

728
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,860
And now I know it wouldn't have made
a difference.

729
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:28,159
Besides which, if I had and you rejected
me, I would have despised you...

730
01:03:28,184 --> 01:03:30,684
... and I wouldn't be sitting here with
you right now, having...

731
01:03:32,859 --> 01:03:35,358
...having the best night of my entire life.

732
01:03:42,857 --> 01:03:44,357
Dare!

733
01:03:44,857 --> 01:03:53,356
Come over here and bring your lips as close
to mine as possible, without touching.

734
01:03:55,856 --> 01:03:58,355
Truth. Are you messing with me right now?

735
01:04:00,855 --> 01:04:03,355
Dare. Come and find out!

736
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:17,353
Come on...

737
01:04:18,853 --> 01:04:21,852
- Is that good?
- No. Not good. Come closer.

738
01:04:30,851 --> 01:04:33,351
What's that sound?

739
01:04:33,851 --> 01:04:41,350
I think that's my heart... beating
like really fast.

740
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:45,349
Dare me to make it go faster.

741
01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:50,349
I double dare you.

742
01:05:14,845 --> 01:05:19,345
Oh, yeah hey look, no you know
what. No pressure, ok?

743
01:05:19,845 --> 01:05:21,845
Tonight no thinking, just doing.

744
01:05:42,842 --> 01:05:44,841
- Now.
- Now.

745
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:59,740
- What's going on, Wendy?
- Please just sit for a second, I just wanna talk.

746
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:06,539
Well, this is a big step. But I think
it's the right thing.

747
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:08,039
Hell yes!

748
01:06:08,238 --> 01:06:12,738
It doesn't exactly take a rocket surgeon
to figure that out.

749
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:16,037
Kyle, I have to tell you something.

750
01:06:16,037 --> 01:06:21,337
- Please tell me you missed your period.
- No, no.

751
01:06:21,837 --> 01:06:25,536
- I applied to grad school.
- Oh.

752
01:06:25,836 --> 01:06:31,035
Wow, grad school. Wow... where?

753
01:06:31,835 --> 01:06:34,335
- Cambridge.
- Is that in the valley?

754
01:06:34,835 --> 01:06:36,835
England...

755
01:06:38,834 --> 01:06:40,334
You want to go to England?

756
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:46,333
Well, I don't know, I just thought we
could talk about it.

757
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:51,533
- What about the condo?
- Well, we could always rent it out.

758
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:55,632
We've got six franchises opening in
Encino alone next year.

759
01:06:56,032 --> 01:06:59,332
Honey my dad is gonna be fucking pissed.

760
01:06:59,832 --> 01:07:01,831
Oh, god damn it. I thought this was
gonna be a special night.

761
01:07:01,831 --> 01:07:03,331
- It is!
- Guess I was wrong.

762
01:07:03,831 --> 01:07:06,330
- No it is.
- No your kinda questioning the whole thing.

763
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,655
What you just want to call the whole
thing off, is that it?

764
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,680
- I don't even know if I got in yet, Kyle.
- Oh!

765
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:15,330
I've been too scared to open it, so why
don't you do it for me!

766
01:07:16,755 --> 01:07:20,455
Sure. Oh really?

767
01:07:24,828 --> 01:07:29,328
<i>"Dear Ms. Franklin, thank your for your
interest in Cambridge University.</i>

768
01:07:29,828 --> 01:07:33,327
<i>We regret to inf... "</i>

769
01:07:37,827 --> 01:07:44,326
<i>"We regret to inform you that you have not
been accepted into our graduate program"</i>

770
01:07:44,826 --> 01:07:46,826
God damn it!

771
01:07:50,825 --> 01:07:56,324
Hey, wait, c'mon. Let's not let some fancy
pants school in England ruin our night.

772
01:07:56,824 --> 01:08:03,423
Honey, you can still do your writing thing and
now you get to do it right here, next to me, ok.

773
01:08:04,823 --> 01:08:06,823
What can I do to make you feel better?

774
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:13,122
How about some bathroom sex. Will that
do it?

775
01:08:16,822 --> 01:08:19,321
How many times have you done that?

776
01:08:20,821 --> 01:08:22,821
You know... 3...

777
01:08:23,821 --> 01:08:27,021
...and a half... times.

778
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:30,820
Oh god.

779
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:34,145
See that is what I really like about
you, Matt.

780
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,319
You're honest.

781
01:08:41,818 --> 01:08:45,318
Tori, there's something that I gotta
tell you.

782
01:08:46,818 --> 01:08:48,817
You have a girlfriend right?

783
01:08:48,817 --> 01:08:52,817
No, it's um...

784
01:08:54,817 --> 01:08:56,316
It's kinda the opposite...

785
01:08:56,816 --> 01:08:58,816
- You have a boyfriend?
- No.

786
01:09:00,816 --> 01:09:04,315
Remember when I bumped into you this
morning at the video store?

787
01:09:06,815 --> 01:09:11,314
Actually I don't work at Goldman Sachs.
I work at that video store.

788
01:09:13,814 --> 01:09:17,314
- What?
- Seriously, I work at Suncoast Video.

789
01:09:17,814 --> 01:09:19,313
Shut up...

790
01:09:21,813 --> 01:09:25,313
No, seriously, I work at Suncoast Video.

791
01:09:32,812 --> 01:09:36,111
- You lied to me?
- No, I mean I know it was stupid.

792
01:09:36,311 --> 01:09:40,311
But I only did it because I thought if you
knew that my life was such a dead end...

793
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:42,410
- I wouldn't sleep with you.
- No.

794
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:45,310
Oh my god. I am so stupid.

795
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:49,809
I actually thought that maybe you wanted to
get to know me.

796
01:09:49,834 --> 01:09:50,808
I do!

797
01:09:50,809 --> 01:09:55,409
You know what. Congratulations Matt, you
slept with your high school crush.

798
01:09:55,434 --> 01:09:56,634
Mission accomplished!

799
01:09:56,809 --> 01:09:58,308
No, Tori.

800
01:09:59,808 --> 01:10:02,608
Tori!

801
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:06,833
Ah... Fuck!

802
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:13,406
Where the hell have you been man?

803
01:10:14,306 --> 01:10:17,706
- You will not believe what the hell just happened.
- Barry, I gotta get out of here.

804
01:10:17,806 --> 01:10:20,105
Big ditto on that. These people are ??

805
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:22,805
Come on.

806
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,804
Shit.

807
01:10:32,804 --> 01:10:35,303
Barry, Barry.

808
01:10:35,803 --> 01:10:38,303
- Yeah.
- I slept with Tori Frederking.

809
01:10:43,802 --> 01:10:46,302
Are you shitting me?

810
01:10:54,801 --> 01:11:02,800
Los Angeles, Matt Franklin had sex
with Tori Frederking, tonight.

811
01:11:12,799 --> 01:11:14,298
What a night!

812
01:11:14,323 --> 01:11:17,223
Then I told her I worked at Suncoast.

813
01:11:17,798 --> 01:11:19,797
And then you told her what?

814
01:11:20,298 --> 01:11:22,597
I told her I work at Suncoast.

815
01:11:22,597 --> 01:11:26,597
- Why are you like this?
- It wasn't fair. I had to be honest with her.

816
01:11:26,597 --> 01:11:28,597
What are you, stupid?

817
01:11:28,796 --> 01:11:36,295
How do you fuck this up, man? Why can't you
give yourself one night of enjoyment?

818
01:11:37,795 --> 01:11:39,795
Put a little relish on your hotdog.

819
01:11:42,795 --> 01:11:44,294
Here...

820
01:11:44,794 --> 01:11:48,793
- I want you to do this.
- No.

821
01:11:48,794 --> 01:11:50,794
- Matthew...
- I don't do drugs.

822
01:11:50,794 --> 01:11:53,393
- You don't do anything.
- I just had sex with Tori Frederking.

823
01:11:53,493 --> 01:11:57,693
Yeah, well, I guess that's not gonna work
out for you now, is it?

824
01:11:57,793 --> 01:11:59,292
You fucked it up!

825
01:11:59,792 --> 01:12:01,292
Sorry pal.

826
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:07,291
- Alright, take the wheel.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talkin about.

827
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:14,690
- You got it?
- Barry!

828
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:17,290
- Yeah.
- Holy shit!

829
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:20,290
Holy shit!

830
01:12:31,788 --> 01:12:34,088
We only lost a little bit.

831
01:12:58,785 --> 01:13:05,184
We start splashing around and fooling around and
the next thing you know, this flotation ring...

832
01:13:05,209 --> 01:13:06,409
...hits me in the head.

833
01:13:06,784 --> 01:13:11,283
- And I look up and...
- It's his grandma.

834
01:13:11,783 --> 01:13:14,283
Yeah. My crazy grandmother.

835
01:13:14,783 --> 01:13:20,082
And she says to me "I can't tell if you're
fucking or drowning..."

836
01:13:20,107 --> 01:13:22,207
...but neither one is letting me get
any sleep.

837
01:13:24,781 --> 01:13:28,281
- Could be worse.
- No it couldn't, Barry.

838
01:13:28,781 --> 01:13:31,280
It couldn't be any worse.

839
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:35,280
Put your hands in the air.

840
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:41,279
I was wrong. Now it couldn't be
any worse.

841
01:13:41,779 --> 01:13:44,779
- Matthew?
- Wow, wrong again.

842
01:13:45,779 --> 01:13:47,278
Oh my god, oh my god.

843
01:13:47,278 --> 01:13:48,278
Calling for a backup request, over.

844
01:13:49,778 --> 01:13:51,578
Are you two okay?

845
01:13:51,778 --> 01:13:53,278
- Yeah.
- Yeah dad.

846
01:13:53,777 --> 01:13:58,277
- What's that all over your face, Barry?
- Cocaine.

847
01:13:59,777 --> 01:14:02,276
Dad, we're fine. Thank god you're
on duty tonight.

848
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:04,276
Yeah.

849
01:14:04,776 --> 01:14:06,776
Let's get outta the car.

850
01:14:08,776 --> 01:14:10,775
Take it easy. Alright.

851
01:14:10,775 --> 01:14:11,775
- Get down on the ground!
- What?

852
01:14:12,275 --> 01:14:14,275
- Get down on the god damn ground!
- Oh my god.

853
01:14:16,275 --> 01:14:17,274
Oh no!

854
01:14:17,774 --> 01:14:20,274
Why'd you steal a car? Why'd you
steal it?

855
01:14:20,274 --> 01:14:24,973
He had nothing to do with it, it was
all me. He was there, yeah...

856
01:14:24,998 --> 01:14:26,698
...but he chickened out at the end. He
went back to the car.

857
01:14:26,773 --> 01:14:29,773
- You did nothing!?
- I drove the stolen car, that's it.

858
01:14:30,273 --> 01:14:34,272
I stole the car. And then the cocaine
was in the car.

859
01:14:35,272 --> 01:14:38,772
- You didn't buy the coke?
- No, no, no.

860
01:14:38,772 --> 01:14:42,770
- And you didn't have any?
- No I swear to god, dad.

861
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:47,770
Please Mr. Franklin. Don't send me to jail.

862
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:52,770
Yeah this car is in pretty rough shape.
What's the sticker price on this, Barry?

863
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:55,269
Fifty three thousand.

864
01:14:55,769 --> 01:14:59,669
Fifty eight thousand with the full chrome
and leather package.

865
01:14:59,769 --> 01:15:05,368
Yeah, after you serve your jail time, I
figure you'll be on probation...

866
01:15:05,393 --> 01:15:09,393
...working this off for at least one
to two years.

867
01:15:09,768 --> 01:15:11,267
Dad, the car's not that damaged.

868
01:15:11,767 --> 01:15:13,267
- Holy shit!
- Maybe three!

869
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:16,767
- Four years.
- Jesus christ, dad.

870
01:15:17,766 --> 01:15:19,766
Maybe five.

871
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:21,865
Depending on what kind of job you get.

872
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:25,690
Of course with your education, you should
be able to earn a decent salary.

873
01:15:25,765 --> 01:15:30,765
- I swear to God I'll get an engineering job, dad!
- But you don't want an engineering job, Matthew.

874
01:15:30,765 --> 01:15:34,566
- I'll do whatever you want me to do.
- But what do you want?

875
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:36,264
I don't know.

876
01:15:36,764 --> 01:15:40,564
No, Dad I'm sorry. I'm just messed
up, ok?

877
01:15:40,763 --> 01:15:44,463
I don't know what I wanna do and I'm
sorry I'm such a fucking failure!

878
01:15:47,763 --> 01:15:52,662
You haven't really failed, son. Because
you haven't really tried to succeed.

879
01:15:52,762 --> 01:15:55,662
So don't credit yourself as a failure.

880
01:15:55,761 --> 01:15:57,761
You're worse than that!

881
01:16:03,862 --> 01:16:06,862
I just can't figure it out, dad.

882
01:16:07,087 --> 01:16:10,087
Don't cry like that in jail, son.

883
01:16:12,612 --> 01:16:15,912
I don't wanna go.

884
01:16:18,758 --> 01:16:25,158
You boys will spend at least 7 days in
LA county jail before they arraign you.

885
01:16:26,057 --> 01:16:29,657
- You'll be there with child molesters.
- Please don't.

886
01:16:29,757 --> 01:16:34,457
But don't worry. We'll make sure the
guards know you're a cops kid.

887
01:16:37,756 --> 01:16:41,355
Hey Bill, I can't keep this up. Look at
Matt's face.

888
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:44,380
He's about ??

889
01:16:45,755 --> 01:16:51,254
- Ok boys. This is your one and only Mulligan.
- What?

890
01:16:51,754 --> 01:16:55,254
- You're free to go.
- Oh my god, thank you.

891
01:16:56,754 --> 01:17:03,453
- You guys don't have to turn us in?
- Relax, Matt. We're LAPD.

892
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:06,752
But don't do it again, Barry! I mean
it. No more coke!

893
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:11,752
Oh are you kidding me! Never, never. Are
you crazy!

894
01:17:12,251 --> 01:17:16,251
- This was like the craziest night.
- Wipe that coke off your face.

895
01:17:17,751 --> 01:17:23,750
I can't...someone... Mr. Johnson!?

896
01:17:30,749 --> 01:17:33,249
Thank you Mr. Franklin.

897
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:36,748
Matt, take a shot at something.

898
01:17:36,748 --> 01:17:40,248
Don't think about it too much. Just
take the shot.

899
01:17:40,748 --> 01:17:42,248
I don't even know where to aim.

900
01:17:42,747 --> 01:17:47,247
Anywhere...everywhere...just take
wild shots.

901
01:17:47,747 --> 01:17:50,847
Hell, it's something just to hear the
gun go off.

902
01:17:54,646 --> 01:17:56,646
Thanks, dad.

903
01:18:04,945 --> 01:18:07,444
That was very scary!

904
01:18:08,744 --> 01:18:11,244
My brain feels like snot.

905
01:18:11,744 --> 01:18:15,243
I think she might have left the car
back at Kyles.

906
01:18:18,743 --> 01:18:20,743
Matt come on.

907
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:27,742
Ball! Ball! Ball! Ball!

908
01:18:28,991 --> 01:18:33,990
Anybody who thinks Broder will actually ride
the ball, place your bets with Bryce...

909
01:18:34,015 --> 01:18:37,015
...anybody who thinks he won't go through
with it, cause he's a total pussy...

910
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,240
...place your bets with Benji.

911
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:41,490
And it's going to be...choice!

912
01:19:00,987 --> 01:19:04,487
- They're gonna run the world.
- How do you know she's still here?

913
01:19:04,987 --> 01:19:06,986
Asshole.

914
01:19:07,986 --> 01:19:09,986
She's here.

915
01:19:20,985 --> 01:19:24,184
- Do I get a helmet?
- Yeah, it's down there, by the tampons.

916
01:19:24,209 --> 01:19:25,409
Fucking slam it!

917
01:19:26,684 --> 01:19:29,684
??

918
01:19:29,983 --> 01:19:31,983
- Hey.
- Hey.

919
01:19:35,983 --> 01:19:40,382
Matt... please, don't be mad.

920
01:19:40,482 --> 01:19:43,782
Wow, Shelly. This really hurts.

921
01:19:49,981 --> 01:19:53,780
No I'm not riding it man. I'm not
riding it.

922
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,780
I got fired today.

923
01:20:02,979 --> 01:20:05,479
I think I'm gonna ride the ball.

924
01:20:05,979 --> 01:20:08,379
- Tori!
- I'm not interested in anymore of your bullshit..

925
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:12,578
Look, listen to me. I only lied about one
detail about myself.

926
01:20:12,603 --> 01:20:15,703
And that's my job. Everything else was
real... tonight was... real...

927
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:17,877
And it was amazing.

928
01:20:17,977 --> 01:20:20,976
But you never would have talked to me for
more than 2 minutes, admit it...

929
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:23,201
...if you knew I worked for Suncoast Video.

930
01:20:23,976 --> 01:20:26,476
You lied to me all night so I would
have sex with you.

931
01:20:26,976 --> 01:20:30,476
So you only had sex with me because
you thought I was a banker?

932
01:20:30,975 --> 01:20:33,475
No, I went to a party with you
because I thought you were a banker.

933
01:20:33,975 --> 01:20:42,474
But I had sex with you because I thought
that you were smart and funny and honest.

934
01:20:42,974 --> 01:20:47,973
I thought you were different from everybody
else. But you're not.

935
01:20:47,998 --> 01:20:52,198
You're just like all these other scared
little boys.

936
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:57,572
All right, hey. Who's it gonna be? Who's
steppin up to the plate tonight.

937
01:20:57,597 --> 01:20:59,597
Who wants a shot at the title?

938
01:21:00,972 --> 01:21:02,471
I'll do it!

939
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:07,471
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a
contestant. The Mattinator. Franklin!

940
01:21:08,971 --> 01:21:10,470
What are you doing?

941
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:12,470
I don't know.

942
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:17,070
Clear the way. Clear the way.

943
01:21:17,269 --> 01:21:20,669
No, Matt. Please don't do this, ok!
You don't have to prove anything to these people.

944
01:21:20,969 --> 01:21:24,468
Whoever thinks Matt's not gonna do it,
place your bets with Benji.

945
01:21:24,968 --> 01:21:26,468
- And anybody...
- Don't.

946
01:21:26,968 --> 01:21:30,768
Listen to me. You don't wanna do this, man.
Let me do it for you.

947
01:21:30,968 --> 01:21:34,767
You have a great life ahead of you. I
got nothing. Matt, don't do this!

948
01:21:34,967 --> 01:21:36,467
God damn it!

949
01:21:36,967 --> 01:21:40,167
Ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause
for Mr Goldman Sachs.

950
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:45,966
Shut the fuck up and drive!

951
01:21:46,966 --> 01:21:48,965
- Deal!
- Matt don't do this!

952
01:21:48,965 --> 01:21:50,865
Why are you doing this?

953
01:21:51,965 --> 01:21:54,965
Please don't do this, Matt. Oh my god.

954
01:21:57,964 --> 01:22:03,463
I'm Matt Franklin. I work at Suncoast
Video at the mall...

955
01:22:03,488 --> 01:22:05,988
...and I still live with my parents!

956
01:22:08,563 --> 01:22:10,063
You suck!

957
01:22:10,962 --> 01:22:15,762
I don't know what I'm doing up here.
I'm scared. And you know what...

958
01:22:16,962 --> 01:22:21,061
I have been so afraid of my life, that I
have missed my life.

959
01:22:21,961 --> 01:22:24,961
But I'm like all of you. We're
all scared!

960
01:22:24,961 --> 01:22:27,460
I mean c'mon. Admit it.

961
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,460
We're all trying to be something that
we're not.

962
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,459
But tonight, all of that changes.

963
01:22:34,959 --> 01:22:40,359
Tonight, I'm not afraid. Tonight, I got
one thing to say to all that bullshit!

964
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,458
Fuck it.

965
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:01,383
Kyle... Kyle... I'm begging you.

966
01:23:01,408 --> 01:23:02,608
Please don't let him do this.

967
01:23:02,633 --> 01:23:05,033
No, honey. It's actually really safe.

968
01:23:05,058 --> 01:23:08,358
Relax. He's gonna roll down this hill
right, you see the bend...

969
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:11,083
...it actually goes up hill, right. You
know how gravity works, right?

970
01:23:11,108 --> 01:23:13,508
He's just gonna stop. It's gonna be
gentle.

971
01:23:13,533 --> 01:23:15,133
And, it's gonna be choice!

972
01:23:15,158 --> 01:23:18,358
Look! Look! I'm telling you, that's my
brother and I love him...

973
01:23:18,383 --> 01:23:19,583
...and I don't want you to do this!

974
01:23:19,608 --> 01:23:23,108
Oh... did I say it was going to be choice?
I did, so cool out!

975
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:31,933
Yeah, let's make some noise for
Matt Franklin!

976
01:23:42,358 --> 01:23:43,558
On three!

977
01:23:44,383 --> 01:23:45,583
Three!

978
01:23:56,908 --> 01:23:58,708
Oh shit! Oh Shit!

979
01:24:12,946 --> 01:24:14,246
Shit!

980
01:24:14,446 --> 01:24:15,946
Matt!

981
01:24:22,945 --> 01:24:24,445
A my god.

982
01:24:25,945 --> 01:24:27,445
Holy christ.

983
01:24:36,443 --> 01:24:37,443
Oh shit!

984
01:24:44,942 --> 01:24:46,442
Fuck!

985
01:24:46,942 --> 01:24:48,442
Oh my god!

986
01:24:48,642 --> 01:24:50,142
Fuck me! Fuck me!

987
01:25:14,938 --> 01:25:17,438
Shit. Help!

988
01:25:17,938 --> 01:25:19,438
Fuck!

989
01:25:35,936 --> 01:25:38,435
- Give me your truck!
- Honey, the road is not supposed to do that.

990
01:25:38,935 --> 01:25:41,435
- Give me your fucking keys!
- Relax.

991
01:25:41,935 --> 01:25:44,434
- Don't fucking touch me.
- I did not know the road bends like that.

992
01:25:44,934 --> 01:25:46,434
I'll drive.

993
01:26:26,429 --> 01:26:27,429
Matt!

994
01:26:27,429 --> 01:26:28,929
Matt!

995
01:26:28,929 --> 01:26:31,428
No, no no.

996
01:26:37,927 --> 01:26:39,427
Are you ok? You ok?

997
01:26:39,927 --> 01:26:41,427
Holy Shit!

998
01:26:41,927 --> 01:26:46,426
- You were the ??
- I rode the fucking ball!

999
01:26:55,925 --> 01:26:57,925
- Oh hello.
- Thank god.

1000
01:26:57,925 --> 01:26:59,425
Matt!

1001
01:27:01,025 --> 01:27:02,424
Take him.

1002
01:27:03,924 --> 01:27:06,924
Matt, don't ever do that again,
you hear me!?

1003
01:27:06,924 --> 01:27:08,923
That's not a problem.

1004
01:27:20,122 --> 01:27:22,622
Can I have your phone number?

1005
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:28,421
I just want to take you out to dinner.
Or like a movie.

1006
01:27:29,921 --> 01:27:31,420
Just hang out with you.

1007
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,420
Matt you were a loser in high school.

1008
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:39,919
Now you're just a loser who rode the
ball and fucked me!

1009
01:27:43,719 --> 01:27:45,219
Are you happy?

1010
01:27:45,919 --> 01:27:47,418
No.

1011
01:27:47,918 --> 01:27:50,718
I'm so sorry I lied to you.

1012
01:27:51,918 --> 01:27:53,618
I'm so sorry, Tori.

1013
01:27:53,917 --> 01:27:56,417
I'll leave you alone now.

1014
01:27:57,917 --> 01:27:59,417
I promise.

1015
01:28:03,916 --> 01:28:05,416
Matt!

1016
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:10,415
818 404-7327

1017
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:17,414
And that was pretty impressive.

1018
01:28:28,913 --> 01:28:30,913
Matt. Hey Matt!

1019
01:28:33,412 --> 01:28:36,012
My friend Matt Franklin!

1020
01:28:41,911 --> 01:28:43,411
So it all worked out!

1021
01:28:43,911 --> 01:28:46,011
You were happy when you read
that letter tonight.

1022
01:28:46,011 --> 01:28:47,311
- No I was not happy.
- Yes.

1023
01:28:47,411 --> 01:28:48,610
- I was not.
- Yes you were.

1024
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:50,710
- I was not happy.
- I saw it. I just want you to admit it!

1025
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,710
What? Admit what?

1026
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:55,909
That I don't want my baby to leave
the nest?

1027
01:28:55,909 --> 01:28:57,409
Is that why you're mad at me?

1028
01:28:58,909 --> 01:29:02,709
- I'm canceling the movers, Kyle.
- Whoa, what does that mean?

1029
01:29:02,908 --> 01:29:05,408
You know what it means.

1030
01:29:05,908 --> 01:29:07,808
Honey, you said yes tonight.

1031
01:29:07,908 --> 01:29:10,907
- Yeah I know.
- Oh shit, Wenders.

1032
01:29:10,907 --> 01:29:13,707
Don't do this to me.

1033
01:29:13,907 --> 01:29:17,407
I'm begging you don't, don't do it.

1034
01:29:20,906 --> 01:29:22,906
I'm doing it!

1035
01:29:35,904 --> 01:29:40,404
You just screwed with my heart.

1036
01:29:47,903 --> 01:29:52,402
You know what? I don't know what the hell
I'm gonna do with myself now.

1037
01:29:53,902 --> 01:29:57,401
Hell I don't know what to do with myself while
I'm thinking about what to do with myself.

1038
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:03,401
You know, that's what college is for.

1039
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:09,700
- There's a lot of this.
- No, not right now.

1040
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,899
And there's also a lot of this...

1041
01:30:24,398 --> 01:30:26,397
You're beginning to make a lot of sense.

1042
01:30:35,896 --> 01:30:40,396
We should... probably say goodbye, before
I screw this up again.

1043
01:30:40,896 --> 01:30:44,395
- Ok.
- Ok.

1044
01:30:55,894 --> 01:31:00,893
- That was bold!
- That's the scariest thing I did all night!

1045
01:31:58,285 --> 01:32:03,685
- Who wants breakfast?
- Yeah... yikes!
