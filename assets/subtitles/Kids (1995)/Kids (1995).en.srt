1
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:11,957
Know what I want to do?

2
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:13,208
Yeah.

3
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:15,210
What do I want to do?

4
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,754
You want to fuck me.

5
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:20,340
But you can't fuck me.

6
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:21,716
Why not?

7
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:24,093
You know why.

8
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:25,720
'Cause you're a virgin?

9
00:01:25,762 --> 00:01:27,680
'Cause I don't want no baby.

10
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:31,851
You think I want a baby?

11
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:35,354
With me, you don't have to worry
about that kind of shit.

12
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,064
Why is that?

13
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:39,107
'Cause I like you.

14
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,067
I think you're beautiful...

15
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,570
And I think if we fucked,
you'd love it.

16
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:47,198
You wouldn't believe it.

17
00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:50,201
I wouldn't believe it?

18
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:54,830
I don't know, I just think
you would love it, that's all.

19
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,251
I don't know. I'm scared
that things would change...

20
00:01:59,334 --> 00:02:00,752
between us.

21
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:03,630
What things?
Nothing's going to change.

22
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,718
I just want to make
you happy, that's all.

23
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:23,398
You know
it won't hurt.

24
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:27,610
I'll be gentle,
I promise.

25
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:31,530
Do you care about me?

26
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,741
Of course I do.

27
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:37,132
Boy: Virgins.
I love them.

28
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:38,258
No diseases,

29
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:41,261
no loose-as-a-goose pussy,
no skank,

30
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,595
no nothing.

31
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:44,347
Just pure pleasure.

32
00:03:47,308 --> 00:03:48,517
Girl: Wait...

33
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:51,395
That hurts.

34
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:32,905
- What's up, bitch?
- Shit, yo.

35
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:34,281
- What happened?
- Guess.

36
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:35,866
You fucked her?

37
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:38,702
I knew you fucked her.
I sat here for like two hours.

38
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:40,662
She was 12,
you hit that shit up.

39
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:44,415
Well, who I am?
I'm the motherfucking virgin surgeon.

40
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:45,792
How was that shit, yo?

41
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:48,961
Oh, my God, so good.
That girl can fuck.

42
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:50,796
Word, she can fuck, yo?

43
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:53,382
Hells, yeah! Halfway through,
I'm thinking about...

44
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,969
"This girl's no virgin.
No virgin can fuck like this. "

45
00:05:56,969 --> 00:05:58,595
You sure she's a virgin?

46
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:01,806
Hell, yeah.
That bitch was bleeding, dude.

47
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,558
When I first put it in,

48
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:06,686
she all screamed all loud,
and then like...

49
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:10,314
I think I saw her bite down
on her pillow, but I don't know.

50
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:12,358
- How long did it take?
- Did what take?

51
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:14,193
How long you fuck her for?

52
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:16,653
Well, you know,
it took me 15 minutes

53
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:18,488
to talk her into it
and everything.

54
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:21,157
It took a little longer
than I expected.

55
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:24,452
But once it was on, we fucked
for a good half an hour.

56
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:27,205
I had to keep taking it out
and putting it back in.

57
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,749
It hurt the first time.
Didn't want to come too quick.

58
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,418
Did her puss stink?

59
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:33,544
Take a whiff.

60
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,546
Mmm...
Butterscotch, yo.

61
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,964
That's the best.

62
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,217
That bitch
was so clean, dude.

63
00:06:41,217 --> 00:06:42,135
Word?

64
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,512
You could tell she took
care of herself.

65
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:45,680
How?

66
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:47,431
'Cause she, like,
had all these like...

67
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:50,267
powders and creams
in her bathroom.

68
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,769
Let me smell
that shit again.

69
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,731
I'm telling you, man,
that's why I love virgins.

70
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:57,065
They're the best.

71
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,442
Purity, man.

72
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,318
- You know what else?
- What?

73
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:02,237
You can tell she just
entered puberty.

74
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,196
How?

75
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:06,407
'Cause I was flipping through
this picture book of her family.

76
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,744
And there was this picture
of her painting Easter eggs.

77
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:13,205
And I was like, "Damn, you were
pretty cute when you were little. "

78
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:17,417
All right?
So, like, she was all like...

79
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:19,794
"That picture was taken
less than a year ago.

80
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,546
I look younger
without makeup. "

81
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:23,965
That's a good one.

82
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:28,094
So I was like,
"Shit, this girl's a baby. "

83
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:29,804
Then I was like,
"Oh, shit...

84
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:33,390
that turns me on.
I want to fuck this baby girl. "

85
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:35,392
Fucking perverted bastard,
I swear.

86
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:36,852
I'm tellin' you, Cas,

87
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:38,270
I'm getting addicted
to this shit.

88
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:39,854
To what, virgins?

89
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:42,607
It's all I think about now.

90
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:44,484
Having complex fantasies
and shit.

91
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:47,403
- What do you mean?
- Like going all out.

92
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,864
You mean, like fucking
two virgins at once?

93
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:52,741
That would be kinda sweet,
but I mean like...

94
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:54,910
when I was fucking her,
right...

95
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:58,330
I kept thinking how much
I wanted to put it in her ass.

96
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,540
She'd probably smash you
in the grille, kid.

97
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:03,459
I don't know about that.
She was pretty into it.

98
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:06,087
What do you want to do?

99
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,297
Get another 40.
Smoke a blunt or some shit.

100
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:10,633
- You hungry?
- I'm fucking starving, yo.

101
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:13,052
Wait up a sec.
I'm taking a piss.

102
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,887
Right up on this piece.

103
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:16,930
Hey, let's go to Paul's house.

104
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:18,682
Paul, what for?
That guy's a dick.

105
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,267
Yeah, but he always got food.

106
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:22,435
He got them microwave
burrito things, you know?

107
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,145
Think he's got any herb
on him?

108
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,981
He quit dealing,
but I'm sure he'll smoke us out.

109
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,608
- You think?
- Probably.

110
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,737
He lives on 76th, right?

111
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,364
78th.

112
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:37,949
Let's be ghosts, man.

113
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,536
Hey, Telly,
she suck your dick, man?

114
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:44,580
A little bit,
but I really didn't want her to.

115
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:45,957
Why not, man?

116
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:48,709
Having a virgin suck your dick,
that's so basic, man.

117
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:50,503
It's simple. It's easy.

118
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:53,088
But like, if you deflower a girl,
man...

119
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:54,214
You're the man!

120
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:56,216
No one can ever
do that again.

121
00:08:56,258 --> 00:08:58,093
You're the only one.

122
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:00,470
No one has the power
to do that again.

123
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,012
Right.

124
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:04,641
The way I see it,
my outlook on the situation...

125
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:05,683
Mr. Wizard.

126
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:07,560
It's like getting fame,
you know?

127
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:09,687
Say you was to die
tomorrow, right?

128
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:11,397
50 years from now,

129
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:13,816
all the virgins you ever fucked
will remember you.

130
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:15,817
They'll tell their grandkids
about that shit.

131
00:09:15,943 --> 00:09:18,153
"That Telly, he sure
was good in the sack. "

132
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:20,530
You thirsty?

133
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,782
Hells, yeah.
I'm fucking dehydrated.

134
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:23,741
You got any money?

135
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,868
Three pennies
and a ball of lint, kid.

136
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,370
You down with the boost?

137
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:28,287
True.

138
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:30,498
Chill a second.

139
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:49,265
You happen to have diss digg?

140
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,558
What?

141
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:53,018
Diss digg.
I'm curious, do you have it?

142
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:54,561
What is "diss digg"?

143
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:56,188
Diss digg.

144
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:57,230
What are you saying?

145
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,399
Diss digg here.
Do you have it?

146
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,358
What?

147
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:03,361
Diss digg.
Diss digg.

148
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,280
I don't...
I don't understand you.

149
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,699
A'ight, one last time.
Do you have diss digg?

150
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,284
What you say, diss digg?

151
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:11,911
He said, "this dick,"
motherfucker.

152
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:14,037
Don't you understand English?

153
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:25,840
Stupid fuck boys.
Fuck you.

154
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,107
What's up?

155
00:10:44,148 --> 00:10:46,109
- It's Telly.
- You like peaches?

156
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,362
It's Telly, man. Open up.

157
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:07,211
Yo, yo!

158
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,549
What's up?
What's going on?

159
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:14,301
What's up?

160
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,771
Shit.

161
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,690
What's all this shit, man?

162
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,318
Fuckin' up our crib.

163
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:33,152
Fuck the crib.

164
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,696
Move the fuck over,
you bitch ass.

165
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,030
What's going on?

166
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:40,200
Nothin'. Chillin'.
What y'all up to?

167
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,451
You want a whip-it?

168
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,245
Give me one of them shits.

169
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,290
This balloon almost busted,
so be careful.

170
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,544
This video is phat.

171
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,214
Listen for that crack.

172
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,217
Pop that shit.

173
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:03,596
I told you, be careful.

174
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:10,686
How you doin' there?

175
00:12:13,981 --> 00:12:17,651
You're going to be a vegetable
when you're older.

176
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,486
Fuck off.

177
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:22,030
- My God. Look at his lip.
- Check it out, nigga.

178
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,032
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

179
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:27,243
Your lips are blue.

180
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:29,620
Shut up!
You don't even know me, nigga.

181
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:36,335
Look at this kid, yo.
He's like a fiend.

182
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:38,462
That's why I like this shit.

183
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:40,297
They wake my brain up.

184
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:42,757
There's more, man.

185
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:45,968
- How many people live here?
- Too many.

186
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:48,763
No, only eight or nine.

187
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:51,557
Where does everyone sleep?
You homosexuals?

188
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,144
No, get the fuck out of here.

189
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:57,270
Everywhere.
It's a flophouse, man.

190
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,855
We're still short on the rent.

191
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:01,816
If we had a faggot,
he'd pay the rent.

192
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:03,568
You and Casper can move in.

193
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:05,445
You could share the bathtub.

194
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:07,280
- I don't know about that.
- Yo, Telly...

195
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:08,781
Jenny says, "What's up?"

196
00:13:08,781 --> 00:13:10,199
Jenny who?

197
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:11,617
You know, Jenny.

198
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:13,619
Casper: That pretty girl you boned
last summer.

199
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:16,955
I haven't seen her in forever.
What's she up to?

200
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:20,917
I knew he wouldn't
speak to me. That dick.

201
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,335
You still mad at him?

202
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,087
Of course.
How can I forgive him?

203
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:26,547
- What did he do?
- He stole her virginity.

204
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:29,884
He took it away
and now it's gone forever.

205
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,261
It's not the fact
that he devirginized me,

206
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:34,930
it's that he never
spoke to me again.

207
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:37,849
He talked all this bullshit
and then just broke out.

208
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:42,062
But he was all like, "Jenny,
I like you so much," and...

209
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,814
"I promise,
I won't use you. "

210
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:45,898
Same lines.

211
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,400
He was talking mad shit.

212
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:49,235
The first time
is always whacked.

213
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:52,946
Be glad you didn't lose your
virginity in the back seat of a car.

214
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:55,782
- That's right.
- That's nothing.

215
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:59,369
I had just turned 14.
With this asshole who was 18.

216
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:01,162
I can't remember his name.

217
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:05,041
This was at sleep away camp
with your friends and shit.

218
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,543
We were getting it on
in the bushes, around midnight.

219
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:10,504
I got fucking mosquito bites
all over my ass.

220
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:13,882
I thought nobody knew about it,
but everyone knew the next day.

221
00:14:13,882 --> 00:14:15,717
- And the pain was...
- Hell, yeah!

222
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:19,638
- The fucking pain! Jesus!
- That's the shit.

223
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,848
God, the pain!
The fucking pain! Jesus!

224
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:23,808
You feel like
you're being ripped open.

225
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,602
You are being
ripped open inside.

226
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:28,604
- Did you bleed?
- No, I didn't.

227
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:32,232
- You didn't bleed?
- I bled all over.

228
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,193
On the condom, everywhere.

229
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:37,738
You know what he started singing?
"Sunday, Bloody Sunday. "

230
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:39,698
- "Sunday, Bloody Sunday. "
- That stupid fucking song.

231
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:41,533
I was like, "What the hell?"

232
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:43,451
I couldn't believe
he did that to me.

233
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:46,662
Then everyone at camp was singing
that the whole time.

234
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:50,291
You know what?
I have sex and I like fucking.

235
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,084
Hell, yeah.

236
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:53,836
I love sex, girl.

237
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,838
It's the best.
There's nothing better.

238
00:14:56,838 --> 00:14:59,090
It's the best thing, right?
That's it.

239
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:01,468
No, no, not sex.

240
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:04,262
Foreplay.
Foreplay.

241
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,432
Hardcore pound fucking.

242
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:10,184
That's the shit right there, man.

243
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,394
That's the only way to do it.

244
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,605
It's that boom, boom, boom.

245
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:18,942
But there's a difference
between making love...

246
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,944
having sex and then fucking.

247
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:22,195
Right.

248
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,530
Making love is like...

249
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,656
It's, like, sweet.

250
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,408
It's real slow.
Real slow.

251
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:28,534
Sex is like,

252
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:31,662
"All right,
let's have sex.

253
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:33,789
Let's go, come on. "

254
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,834
That's the whole thing.

256
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:40,503
They want you to be
so kind, so gentle,

257
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:43,131
like you give a fuck
or something.

258
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:48,636
- What's up, Jav?
- What's up?

259
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:51,597
What are you doing
with a cigarette?

260
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,140
Like you care?

261
00:15:53,182 --> 00:15:54,183
Yeah, right.

262
00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:59,563
Most of the time, you just want
to be all pounding that shit.

263
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:01,856
I like that part.

264
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,400
My God!
That motherfucker's the bomb.

265
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:06,152
If you could just be like,

266
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:08,154
"Excuse me, miss,
can I borrow your hole?

267
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:12,408
It'll only take a little bit.
I'll give it right back. "

268
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:14,535
- Right.
- "I'm done. "

269
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:17,496
But that's it.
You got to take it slow.

270
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:21,499
You got to be smooth.
Girls like it slow and romantic.

271
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,835
Fuck romance.
I like it hard and nasty.

272
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:26,421
I've been with a lot of girls,
so I know.

273
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:28,130
Me too, nigga.
What's up?

274
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,510
But it depends.
I was at Eric's house.

275
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:34,845
Smash J was there.

276
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,763
D.J. Flipper was there.

277
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,099
All right?
He was horny.

278
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,352
He threw me on the bed.
We started getting it on.

279
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,146
They were in the room
getting dressed.

280
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:48,357
They were going to a disco.
That shit was so good.

281
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,609
He was fucking fingering me,
sucking on my tits.

282
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:52,903
I was like, "You go, boy. "

283
00:16:52,903 --> 00:16:54,488
We ripped each other's hair out.

284
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,449
We kissed so hard,
our lips were busted.

285
00:16:57,532 --> 00:16:59,951
I was like,
"Work it, boy. "

286
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,871
But y'all know why
I go out with Alex, right?

287
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:06,791
He has the best fucking fingers
I ever had.

288
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:09,168
I'm going out with him.

289
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,545
He got it going on.
That's that.

290
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:13,964
That's why foreplay
is better than sex.

291
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:16,133
They can touch you
and you're going crazy

292
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:19,344
and all of a sudden, it's like,
"What the hell happened?"

293
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:21,763
- Just a big disappointment.
- It's a letdown.

294
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,515
Then it takes them either
too long,

295
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:25,892
or too short to come.

296
00:17:26,017 --> 00:17:28,561
Have you ever had someone
who took forever?

297
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:30,104
What, to come?

298
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:32,564
Let me tell you.
I was having sex with Jake,

299
00:17:32,648 --> 00:17:35,234
and it took my man
an hour and a half.

300
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,194
I don't have
no hour and a half.

301
00:17:37,235 --> 00:17:39,237
No, no, no.

302
00:17:39,237 --> 00:17:42,031
You know what I notice,
though?

303
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,284
Bitches love to suck dick.

304
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:47,662
It's like some secret
hobby for them or some shit.

305
00:17:47,745 --> 00:17:49,413
Some freaks.

306
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:51,790
All bitches, man.
I know, man, I'm telling you.

307
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,334
Casper's right.

308
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,919
They act like they don't
in front of their friends,

309
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:57,337
to try to get respect.

310
00:17:57,421 --> 00:18:00,715
When you get them alone,
it's the first thing they go for.

311
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:04,218
The girls just grab your dick,
start sucking.

312
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:06,512
They know they're
in charge of something.

313
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,097
Only time they feel prosperous.

314
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,267
- I'm telling you.
- They love that shit.

315
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:12,893
That's why girls
live longer than guys.

316
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:15,270
Sperm's got vitamin C
in that shit.

317
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:18,106
The shit's nutritious, right?

318
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,236
Looking at your watch.

319
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:26,405
You know what's the worst?

320
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:29,200
Sucking dick.
I hate sucking dick.

321
00:18:29,283 --> 00:18:32,411
They'll be shooting you in the eye,
and the ear and shit.

322
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:34,913
And you don't know
what to do.

323
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:36,957
It hits that little thing...

324
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:39,960
the tonsils, the esophagus,
whatever the hell it is.

325
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,005
- You don't get anything out of it.
- You'll be gagging.

326
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:46,299
How much more can you bob?

327
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:48,009
You don't get shit.

328
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:50,094
Have you ever swallowed
it before?

329
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:51,720
No.

330
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,680
Me neither.

331
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,432
- I have.
- Of course.

332
00:18:57,851 --> 00:18:59,519
No, but it was like...

333
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:02,856
No, it's like sweet and sour
and salty butter.

334
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,317
It's like...
it's just nasty.

335
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,402
You drink and drink
and you cannot get...

336
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:10,613
the taste out of your mouth.

337
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:13,407
The sperm get stuck in your teeth.
They're disgusting.

338
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,535
You gotta sit down and eat
a whole real meal.

339
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:18,537
All I know is that
condoms suck.

340
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,788
They don't work.

341
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:22,957
They either slip off, or break,
or make your dick shrink.

342
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:27,003
You got a small condom, huh?

343
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:28,713
We still got to use them.

344
00:19:28,754 --> 00:19:30,339
I did once.

345
00:19:30,464 --> 00:19:32,841
Telly's the only guy
I've had sex with.

346
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:36,470
- I thought you had sex with A.J.
- No, we just messed around.

347
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:42,642
That's the whole thing,
you know?

348
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:44,852
You hear of all these diseases.

349
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:47,313
Disease this,
disease that...

350
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:50,649
fucking everyone's dying and shit.
That shit is made up.

351
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,610
I don't know no kid with AIDS.

352
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,154
Ain't no one I know died
from that shit.

353
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,739
Fucking, that's just
some make-believe story.

354
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,618
It's bullshit!

355
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,664
We all going to die anyway.
I'm going to go out fucking.

356
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,499
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?

357
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,385
One guy got tested.
He was negative.

358
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,011
This other guy...

359
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:25,098
he'd fucked only two other girls,
and they were virgins,

360
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:27,016
so he was safe.

361
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:30,853
But then this other guy I just fucked,
which was a mistake.

362
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:33,355
Heat of the moment
kind of thing.

363
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:36,191
But I went to the clinic last week
with Jenny...

364
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:38,318
to get ourselves checked,
to be safe.

365
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,819
Jenny went?

366
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:42,864
She got tested with me
so that I didn't have to be alone.

367
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:44,532
Word, they ask
a lot of questions?

368
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:46,284
Jenny...

369
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:47,535
how old are you?

370
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:48,744
16.

371
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:51,163
How many people have you
had vaginal intercourse with?

372
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:54,333
- One.
- Were you protected?

373
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,042
No.

374
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:59,421
- How old are you, honey?
- 17.

375
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:02,006
How many people have
you had vaginal intercourse with?

376
00:21:02,257 --> 00:21:03,007
Altogether?

377
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:04,634
Yes, altogether.

378
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:07,803
I'd say eight.
Maybe nine.

379
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:10,764
How many times
did you go in unprotected?

380
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:12,391
Four times
I went unprotected.

381
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,017
Maybe it was three.

382
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:16,895
Have you ever had anal
intercourse?

383
00:21:16,937 --> 00:21:17,979
No.

384
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:23,151
Have you ever had anal
intercourse?

385
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:24,402
Yeah.

386
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:26,487
With how many
different people?

387
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:34,286
I think three,
but I'm not sure.

388
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:36,288
Were they wearing condoms?

389
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:39,249
Yes, with two of them.
Twice I didn't.

390
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:40,458
I didn't...

391
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:41,751
two times.

392
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,380
We're going to draw
some blood from you.

393
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,340
Come back in seven days...

394
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:50,843
and we should have the results
of your tests, okay?

395
00:21:50,968 --> 00:21:52,594
Thanks.

396
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,347
You see that
pork fried rice store?

397
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:56,306
The Chinese joint?

398
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,350
Yeah.
My cousin lives right up there.

399
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:01,102
He's mad. Crazy.
His name is Harmonoff.

400
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,481
One time we went to
Special Olympics on a school trip.

401
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:07,900
Seventh grade, whatever.

402
00:22:07,942 --> 00:22:10,486
He tried to pick up
these retarded bitches.

403
00:22:10,486 --> 00:22:13,530
That nigga's crazy.
He's still got a thing for them.

404
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,782
He caught one
dope bitch that day...

405
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:17,868
she had those leg braces
and shit.

406
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:19,661
But she had a fat ass.

407
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,246
You're crazy. Ruthless.

408
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:25,375
He brought her into the bathroom
and fucked the shit out of her.

409
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,669
He was telling me that the leg
braces were scratching up his shit.

410
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:31,547
He hit her hard, yo.
She was all drooling and shit.

411
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,311
So, he's pretty crazy;
he'll do whatever to bust a nut.

412
00:22:47,353 --> 00:22:48,938
- You know?
- That's ruthless shit.

413
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:53,108
He wanted to take the leg braces off,
but he was just like "Fuck it. "

414
00:22:53,192 --> 00:22:55,110
"Let's hit this up real quick. "

415
00:22:56,653 --> 00:22:58,029
Telly: Like quickie style.

416
00:23:01,658 --> 00:23:03,993
¢Ü The summer's gone ¢Ü

417
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:06,871
¢Ü And all the roses dying... ¢Ü

418
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:10,583
Man, this guy's really good, yo.

419
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,543
He reminds me of my uncle.

420
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:15,337
- I bet he brings mad dough in, yo.
- Hells, yeah.

421
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:21,968
¢Ü... when summer's
in the meadow ¢Ü

422
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:28,683
¢Ü Or when the valley's hushed
and white with snow ¢Ü

423
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:32,102
¢Ü It's I'll be here ¢Ü

424
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:35,814
¢Ü I n sunshine or shadow... ¢Ü

425
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:49,410
I don't think I want
to be seein' him anymore.

426
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,620
I want to date other people.
I don't know.

427
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:54,915
I think he's mad at me
or something. But who cares?

428
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:56,792
It's like,
"Get off your high horse.

429
00:23:56,917 --> 00:24:00,086
If I want to see other guys
I'll see other guys. "

430
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,713
So it's just like...

431
00:24:01,713 --> 00:24:03,840
I can't deal with
that jealous crap.

432
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:06,509
I don't know why I see him
in the first place.

433
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:09,845
He's a jerk!
Giving me a hard time. That crap.

434
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:12,097
I think I'm just gonna
dump him completely.

435
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:15,517
I was just tryin' to be nice,
but if he's gonna get...

436
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:18,687
It must have been
something I ate.

437
00:24:18,854 --> 00:24:20,563
Ruby, follow me.

438
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:22,857
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

439
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:33,617
Jenny...

440
00:24:53,302 --> 00:24:55,012
You tested negative

441
00:24:55,053 --> 00:24:58,431
for all sexually transmitted
diseases and infections.

442
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:00,100
Yes!

443
00:25:00,183 --> 00:25:01,643
You're clean.

444
00:25:01,643 --> 00:25:03,561
I can't tell you
how nervous I was.

445
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:04,979
I didn't sleep last night.

446
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:07,398
Now you have to be careful,
Ruby, okay?

447
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:11,402
I want you to take these
pamphlets and read them.

448
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,153
And, Ruby, read them.

449
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:21,161
Jenny, you've tested
positive for the H IV virus.

450
00:25:21,161 --> 00:25:22,120
What?

451
00:25:22,162 --> 00:25:24,080
The test isn't 100% accurate.

452
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:25,915
I tested positive?

453
00:25:26,082 --> 00:25:27,750
I'm sorry.

454
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,710
I only had sex with Telly.

455
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:36,383
I just came to keep
Ruby company.

456
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,691
Yo, I want to fuck Darcy.

457
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:55,817
Who?

458
00:25:55,817 --> 00:25:57,361
You know Darcy.
Bennie's little sister.

459
00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:58,695
You like her, uh-huh?

460
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:00,530
Yo, I liked her
for a while, yeah.

461
00:26:00,613 --> 00:26:01,531
Darcy, yo?

462
00:26:01,531 --> 00:26:04,492
She's so little,
innocent and pretty.

463
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:06,119
She's only 13, man.

464
00:26:06,202 --> 00:26:07,662
Shit.

465
00:26:07,703 --> 00:26:10,331
You remember the last week
at the block party?

466
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:12,916
She was handing out
watermelon slices.

467
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,837
I just sat across from her
and started watching her.

468
00:26:16,837 --> 00:26:18,839
- She was eating this watermelon.
- U h-huh.

469
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,467
Juices just start runnin'
off her chin onto her shirt.

470
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,635
After about three seconds, yo,

471
00:26:23,718 --> 00:26:26,596
I got the biggest
fuckin' hard on, yo.

472
00:26:26,637 --> 00:26:30,266
I just wanted to take out my dick
right there and start jerking off.

473
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:32,017
Shit, yo.

474
00:26:32,017 --> 00:26:34,603
Like at that point,
and moment, like...

475
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:36,938
she was like a vision
of perfection.

476
00:26:36,938 --> 00:26:38,648
I know what you mean, yo.

477
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:42,360
Like, like she represented
everything holy about a virgin.

478
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:45,113
I know what you're saying.
I know.

479
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,781
She works for Nasa, man.

480
00:26:46,781 --> 00:26:48,699
I think she promotes for them.

481
00:26:48,783 --> 00:26:51,452
I'm going to fuck her
tonight, I swear to God.

482
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:54,413
How you going to fuck
two virgins in one day?

483
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:57,249
That shit's got to be
against the law or some shit.

484
00:26:57,332 --> 00:27:00,710
I'm still going to fuck her.
I'll bet you money I'll fuck her.

485
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:02,462
Bet, yo.

486
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:13,764
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

487
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:15,933
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

488
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,517
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

489
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:20,770
Run by the park and get zooted?
See what the fellas are doing?

490
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,731
Yeah, yeah.
But I also got to run home.

491
00:27:23,815 --> 00:27:25,650
Yeah, yeah,
that's cool. That's cool.

492
00:27:27,652 --> 00:27:29,487
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

493
00:27:30,988 --> 00:27:33,907
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

494
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:35,284
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

495
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,160
God bless you.

496
00:27:38,245 --> 00:27:40,038
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

497
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:41,956
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

God bless you.

499
00:27:55,344 --> 00:27:56,970
Bless you back, man.

500
00:27:57,137 --> 00:27:59,306
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

501
00:27:59,347 --> 00:28:01,182
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

502
00:28:01,307 --> 00:28:02,767
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

503
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:20,867
Peter, is Mom there?

504
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,369
No, I need to speak to Mom.

505
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,539
Peter, where's Mommy?

506
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,417
No, I can't talk to you
right now.

507
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,129
Yeah, I hear it.

508
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,968
Just tell her that...

509
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,096
Never mind.
Just go watch television.

510
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,186
Come on.
It's gonna be okay.

511
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:53,689
It's gonna be okay.

512
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:57,818
I'm gonna have to tell
my little brother I'm gonna die.

513
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:00,862
I can't make him
his lunches any more.

514
00:29:00,904 --> 00:29:04,782
Come on. I mean, don't cry.
We'll work it out.

515
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:06,742
I only did it once.

516
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:20,880
I gotta go.
I gotta find Telly.

517
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,549
Don't go anywhere,
just stay with me.

518
00:29:22,632 --> 00:29:25,843
- No, I gotta find him.
- Then I'm coming.

519
00:29:25,885 --> 00:29:27,845
- No, I just gotta go.
- Jen...

520
00:29:28,387 --> 00:29:29,847
Jenny!

521
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:49,407
- What's up, yo?
- Yo, chillin'.

522
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:16,431
Hi, Mom.

523
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,058
Hi, Telly,
where you been?

524
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,060
- What's up?
- Hi, Casper.

525
00:30:20,894 --> 00:30:23,688
We were just out
trying to find jobs.

526
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:26,399
- Any luck?
- No, no.

527
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:31,195
What are you gonna do
about money this summer?

528
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:35,199
I don't know. Find a job.

529
00:30:35,282 --> 00:30:36,742
Can I borrow some money?

530
00:30:36,742 --> 00:30:39,744
Your dad made me promise
not to give you any money

531
00:30:39,744 --> 00:30:41,371
until you find a job.

532
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:43,998
- Then I won't need your money.
- That's right.

533
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:46,292
Come on, Mom.

534
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:48,294
N - O.

535
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:53,882
Come on, Casper.

536
00:30:55,842 --> 00:30:58,261
Damn, Telly.
Your little brother's getting big.

537
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:00,263
Yeah, man, I know.

538
00:31:04,017 --> 00:31:06,394
Yo, Telly, your mom's
titties are looking good.

539
00:31:06,435 --> 00:31:07,603
Shut the fuck up, man.

540
00:31:07,603 --> 00:31:08,813
Damn.

541
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,155
Cardizems.

542
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:32,918
Hey, how do these things work?

543
00:31:32,918 --> 00:31:35,295
How am I supposed to know?

544
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:38,632
How much you gonna take?

545
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,467
I don't know.
How much you want?

546
00:31:40,508 --> 00:31:43,303
$10. $15's good, though.

547
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:54,938
You ever take one of these
things out with your teeth?

548
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:56,398
Stoops.

549
00:31:57,357 --> 00:32:00,151
Your girls don't bleed yet,
that's why.

550
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,737
My girls got mad flavor.

551
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:05,114
Heavy flow.

552
00:32:17,918 --> 00:32:19,920
$15 for me.
$10 for you.

553
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:22,297
You cheap motherfucker, yo.

554
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,881
But I'm supporting your ass.

555
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:26,050
Thanks a lot.

556
00:32:26,217 --> 00:32:27,593
Thievin' bastard.

557
00:32:29,804 --> 00:32:31,180
The fuck outta here, cat.

558
00:32:32,598 --> 00:32:34,600
It's damn hot out!

559
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:36,601
It's a fucking sauna
in here, man.

560
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:40,355
Yo, is crazy hot out.

561
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:42,190
Word, yo.

562
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:44,192
Shit.

563
00:32:48,195 --> 00:32:49,905
Come on, nigga.

564
00:32:49,947 --> 00:32:51,907
You think Darcy
will be at Nasa tonight?

565
00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:53,283
Yeah, probably.

566
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:55,285
You got any weed
around here?

567
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:58,038
No. We should run by the park
and pick up some.

568
00:32:58,038 --> 00:32:59,664
Maybe Darcy'll be there.

569
00:32:59,706 --> 00:33:01,249
True. True.

570
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,668
Yo, I gotta start wearin'
more hats.

571
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:08,214
This is my tape, man.

572
00:33:08,214 --> 00:33:09,799
Hey, my hair looks busted, B.

573
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:12,009
- I'm gonna get buff, B.
- You are?

574
00:33:12,217 --> 00:33:13,010
Hells, yeah.

575
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:16,096
The other day, this Chinese bitch
said I'd look good with muscles.

576
00:33:17,597 --> 00:33:20,767
I'll get mad diesel. Fuck up
any nigga that step to me.

577
00:33:22,393 --> 00:33:24,896
You got hairy armpits.
Word up.

578
00:33:24,896 --> 00:33:26,898
You got Buckwheat
in a headlock there.

579
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:28,107
You want some?

580
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:30,109
Get the fuck out of here
with that.

581
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,944
- You fucking stink, dude.
- So?

582
00:33:31,944 --> 00:33:33,070
You stink.

583
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:37,115
That shit gives me a rash
all over my armpits and my stomach.

584
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,201
I like my smell.
It's fuckin' natural.

585
00:33:39,242 --> 00:33:40,660
You still stink.

586
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,245
Your mother stinks.

587
00:33:43,663 --> 00:33:45,998
These chips are stale.

588
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:49,210
Look at this busted-ass nigga.

589
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:52,588
That's me, nigga.

590
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:54,131
Me and your bitch.

591
00:33:54,214 --> 00:33:55,340
Stoops.

592
00:33:56,717 --> 00:33:59,386
He wants to spend
time together.

593
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:00,970
I hardly know my old man.

594
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:04,766
Shh...

595
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:06,684
I'm going out
for a little while.

596
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,853
- When are you gonna be back?
- Not too late.

597
00:34:08,894 --> 00:34:10,479
4:30 in the morning?

598
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:12,314
Not too late.

599
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,902
You sure I can't get
any money?

600
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:20,447
If I had some, maybe.
Right now, I don't have a penny.

601
00:34:25,201 --> 00:34:27,161
All right, then. Bye.

602
00:34:36,336 --> 00:34:38,380
Shit.

603
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:07,657
What's up, Ras?

604
00:35:07,657 --> 00:35:09,617
Casper.

605
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:14,746
Back off of my customer
there, man.

606
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:18,583
Ras, you got some?

607
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:19,751
Yeah, mon.

608
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:22,754
Let me check out a dime
of that.

609
00:35:22,962 --> 00:35:24,088
Come here.

610
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,133
I want no twigs
or pebbles neither.

611
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,093
I wouldn't do you.

612
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,894
Check this.
Good sinsemilla.

613
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:40,186
Smells delicious.

614
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,230
- I the best.
- Definitely.

615
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,899
How about a dime of that shit?

616
00:35:44,982 --> 00:35:46,609
Drop it.

617
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,366
Good looking out.

618
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:55,742
Come check me out again.

619
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:58,120
- See you tomorrow.
- Later, man.

620
00:36:12,716 --> 00:36:15,594
Yo, Paul, is Telly there?

621
00:36:15,636 --> 00:36:17,471
Is Telly there?

622
00:36:17,471 --> 00:36:18,930
This is Paul.
Who's this?

623
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:20,932
It's Jenny.
Just tell me if Telly's there.

624
00:36:21,057 --> 00:36:22,267
Hello, Jenny.

625
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:24,394
Wanna come upstairs
and make out with me?

626
00:36:24,435 --> 00:36:26,854
Listen, I'm fucking serious.
Where's Telly?

627
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,856
Telly's not here.

628
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:31,192
I think he went downtown
with Casper.

629
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:36,988
My dolly's black Lucy.

630
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,716
Telly: Tracy's talking
to another guy over there.

631
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,301
Casper: Tracy?

632
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,636
Whatever.
She can suck my dick.

633
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,893
What's up, nigga?

634
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,063
What's up, dude?

635
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:15,190
What's up, guy?

636
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:28,536
Shut the fuck up,
you four-eyed bitch!

637
00:38:01,483 --> 00:38:03,109
I tell you what.
That body.

638
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:04,902
Yeah, I'm in that piece,
kid.

639
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:18,748
- What's up, Harold?
- What's up?

640
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:23,002
- Where you at?
- I'm right here, you know?

641
00:38:23,044 --> 00:38:26,005
- You going out tonight?
- Yeah, maybe Nasa or some shit.

642
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:27,590
Yo, word?
You're on the list?

643
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:30,384
Probably.
But fuck that shit. I'll sneak in.

644
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:32,344
I need some female
vagina tonight.

645
00:38:32,386 --> 00:38:34,930
I had some female vagina
last night.

646
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,890
You did? All right!

647
00:38:37,307 --> 00:38:40,101
You want to do any pot?
You got a Phillie?

648
00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:43,146
- Got one.
- Make a trade.

649
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:48,109
You got this in the park?

650
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:50,486
Break that shit up.

651
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,489
Break it.

652
00:38:57,492 --> 00:38:59,119
Scrape it.

653
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:02,038
Lick it.

654
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,666
Dump it.

655
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:27,019
You got it.

656
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:30,481
Smoke it.

657
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:55,754
What's up?

658
00:40:01,217 --> 00:40:02,552
Can I fuck with that?

659
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:04,137
Sure.

660
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:12,019
Yeah, boy.

661
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:19,359
Mad hot, right?

662
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:20,318
Mad hot.

663
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:21,861
I want to go swimmin', kid.

664
00:40:21,861 --> 00:40:23,738
Word.

665
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,114
Look at that shit, man.

666
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,408
Gay guys.

667
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:28,409
That shit is sick.

668
00:40:28,534 --> 00:40:29,910
Faggots!

669
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,370
Fucking faggots!

670
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:32,788
Butt pirate!

671
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,164
Bitch ass faggot!

672
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:37,542
Fuck out of here,
motherfucker!

673
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:39,336
Jungle fever.

674
00:40:43,089 --> 00:40:45,299
Fucking faggot!
Bitch ass faggot!

675
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,431
How can you hang out
with Casper?

676
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:54,349
That nigga's a jerk.

677
00:40:54,433 --> 00:40:56,893
- You think?
- Yeah, yo. I've always hated him.

678
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:59,396
He used to eat glue
in the seventh grade.

679
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:00,855
- Still does.
- I hate him.

680
00:41:03,399 --> 00:41:05,818
Give me a taste of that
motherfuckin' chronic, kid.

681
00:41:08,362 --> 00:41:10,614
This weed is mad good, yo.

682
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:12,908
This your board?

683
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:28,631
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

684
00:41:28,714 --> 00:41:30,883
Well, watch where
the fuck you're skating at.

685
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,718
- Watch where you walk, yo.
- What?

686
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:34,636
- What I said, yo.
- What?

687
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,846
Forget it, B. Nothin'.

688
00:41:35,887 --> 00:41:36,680
What?

689
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,056
Whatever, yo.
Just forget it.

690
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,016
Do you want to get fucked up,
motherfucker?

691
00:41:40,058 --> 00:41:42,435
- What's up, then?
- What do you mean?

692
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,937
- What's up?
- What's up, motherfucker?

693
00:41:54,196 --> 00:41:56,990
Casper: Suck my dick.
Fuckin' suck my dick.

694
00:42:04,997 --> 00:42:07,291
- Beat his ass, fuckers.
- Motherfucker!

695
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:08,751
Punk ass motherfucker.

696
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:36,943
He's out, man!

697
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:39,321
Word up, that shit is out!

698
00:42:46,494 --> 00:42:48,954
Now get in my way, bitch!

699
00:42:49,038 --> 00:42:50,164
Motherfucker.

700
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:57,504
Man: Excuse me.

701
00:42:57,587 --> 00:42:59,839
Can I ask you a question?

702
00:43:01,466 --> 00:43:03,593
Can I ask you a question?

703
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:05,762
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be a pest.

704
00:43:06,596 --> 00:43:09,598
It's just that I was looking
at you and you look upset.

705
00:43:10,432 --> 00:43:13,185
I like looking at you, but...

706
00:43:13,268 --> 00:43:15,812
but your face looks upset.

707
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:17,147
So I was wondering...

708
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,816
if I could be
of any assistance.

709
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:22,569
Maybe cheer you up
or something?

710
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,487
No, I'm okay, thanks.

711
00:43:24,487 --> 00:43:26,489
Okay?

712
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:29,241
Because you don't look okay.

713
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:31,285
You're a very pretty
young lady.

714
00:43:31,493 --> 00:43:32,870
It's just...

715
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:34,830
that your face looks troubled.

716
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:36,832
It's just been a bad day.

717
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:38,667
Miss...

718
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:44,213
Would I be prying
if I asked you what was wrong?

719
00:43:44,213 --> 00:43:46,007
Would I be prying?

720
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,842
Everything's wrong.

721
00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:50,803
No, not everything.

722
00:43:50,886 --> 00:43:53,680
The sun is still shining.

723
00:43:53,806 --> 00:43:55,933
It's a beautiful day.

724
00:43:56,892 --> 00:43:58,768
Some things are okay, right?

725
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,353
I guess so.

726
00:44:00,395 --> 00:44:02,105
Did you break up
with your boyfriend?

727
00:44:02,147 --> 00:44:02,730
No.

728
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,232
You in trouble with the law?

729
00:44:04,315 --> 00:44:05,441
No.

730
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:07,360
Am I getting closer?

731
00:44:07,443 --> 00:44:08,319
That's better.

732
00:44:08,486 --> 00:44:10,529
You look like a prom queen
when you smile.

733
00:44:10,654 --> 00:44:12,239
A glamour girl.

734
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,660
When I was a kid...

735
00:44:17,744 --> 00:44:20,413
I had a crush
on the prom queen.

736
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:22,248
Darlene Lewis.

737
00:44:23,249 --> 00:44:25,752
She had a big black mole...

738
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:28,170
in the middle of her face...

739
00:44:28,212 --> 00:44:31,215
that used to make me
so excited.

740
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:33,092
You look a little bit
like her.

741
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:35,010
Right around the cheeks
and the chin.

742
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:35,969
Thanks.

743
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:39,347
Boy, did I have a crush
on her.

744
00:44:39,514 --> 00:44:42,767
She was the first girl
I put my tongue in her mouth.

745
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:47,939
Hey, look. Whatever it is,
just forget about it.

746
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:51,317
Life is too short.
Try to be happy.

747
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,819
But what if you
can't make yourself happy?

748
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,237
Well...

749
00:44:56,238 --> 00:44:58,448
...then I don't know.

750
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,992
You know what you do then?
You forget.

751
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:02,494
Block it out.

752
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:05,413
I remember...

753
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:10,209
when my grandmother told me
how to be happy.

754
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:11,210
She said, "Leon...

755
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,295
Leon,
my darling little grandson,

756
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,963
if you want to be happy...

757
00:45:15,047 --> 00:45:16,506
don't think.

758
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:20,010
Don't bump into any walls.

759
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,761
If you stutter...

760
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:23,596
don't talk. "

761
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,681
I listened to my grandmother.

762
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,683
Look at me now.

763
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,102
Couldn't be happier.

764
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,646
That's life.

765
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,065
Darcy!

766
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:37,484
Darcy!

767
00:45:38,818 --> 00:45:40,862
Darcy!

768
00:45:41,863 --> 00:45:43,865
Darcy!

769
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:46,284
Darcy!

770
00:45:46,868 --> 00:45:48,786
Bennie, what's up?

771
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:50,412
Nothing. What's up?

772
00:45:50,538 --> 00:45:52,790
Yo, is your sister home?

773
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:55,000
- You want Darcy?
- Yeah.

774
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,335
Hold on.
Let me see if she's here.

775
00:45:58,545 --> 00:46:01,131
Yo, hurry the fuck up, man.
I want to go swimming.

776
00:46:01,131 --> 00:46:03,132
Hold up, man. Damn.

777
00:46:05,134 --> 00:46:06,344
Hey.

778
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:09,638
Hey, what's up?
What are you doin' right now?

779
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,932
I was just getting ready
to take a bath.

780
00:46:12,057 --> 00:46:14,184
Don't take a bath.
Come swim with us.

781
00:46:14,268 --> 00:46:16,186
Hi, Darcy!

782
00:46:16,269 --> 00:46:18,855
Hi, Kim.
Hi, Joy.

783
00:46:18,855 --> 00:46:21,066
Come on.
Come swimmin'.

784
00:46:21,149 --> 00:46:22,192
Right now?

785
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:23,693
Yeah. Come on.

786
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:25,153
Hold on.

787
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,031
So that's your new girl, huh?

788
00:46:29,156 --> 00:46:30,366
I hope so. For now.

789
00:46:30,366 --> 00:46:31,784
You like 'em kinda young,
right?

790
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:33,160
Fuckin' babies.

791
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,537
I like 'em new.
Not like you.

792
00:46:35,621 --> 00:46:36,913
Fuck you.

793
00:46:36,955 --> 00:46:39,457
Damn, bitch,
don't kill the shit.

794
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:41,543
What the fuck?

795
00:46:41,584 --> 00:46:44,003
You think we might've killed
that guy?

796
00:46:44,087 --> 00:46:45,088
No, man.

797
00:46:45,088 --> 00:46:46,088
You sure?

798
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:47,298
Casper: I don't know,
though.

799
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,885
I kicked him so many times,
my fuckin' toes are broken.

800
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,597
No, man. We didn't kill him,
'cause when we were through,

801
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:57,432
he was all twitching.

802
00:46:57,432 --> 00:47:00,435
Word, he was crawling
around the floor and shit.

803
00:47:00,435 --> 00:47:02,395
You guys are fuckin' sick,
you know that?

804
00:47:02,437 --> 00:47:05,189
That's all right.
That's how I'm living.

805
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,818
It's unreal out here,
right, Harold?

806
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,170
Ready.

807
00:47:29,253 --> 00:47:31,005
You look nice.

808
00:48:16,254 --> 00:48:17,881
Hey, girl, what's up?

809
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:20,258
Nothin'.
Just some crazy shit.

810
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,593
Have you seen Telly around?

811
00:48:21,634 --> 00:48:23,219
Yeah.
Speaking of stupid shit...

812
00:48:23,261 --> 00:48:25,388
him and his ape-ass
of a friend, Casper,

813
00:48:25,388 --> 00:48:26,931
they almost just
killed some kid.

814
00:48:27,014 --> 00:48:29,392
- What happened?
- Some messy little scrap.

815
00:48:29,517 --> 00:48:32,186
- You know that bullshit.
- Yeah. You know where he went?

816
00:48:32,394 --> 00:48:35,230
I don't know. He said some shit
about meeting Darcy.

817
00:48:35,355 --> 00:48:37,816
- I think he likes her now.
- Bennie's little sister?

818
00:48:37,941 --> 00:48:39,734
She should be
at Nasa tonight.

819
00:48:39,818 --> 00:48:42,195
Why are you looking for him?
You like him now?

820
00:48:43,112 --> 00:48:46,032
Come on, man.
H urry up.

821
00:48:46,115 --> 00:48:48,242
Get in this piece.

822
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:50,119
H urry up, Kim.

823
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,998
Harold: You think I ain't
motherfuckin' hot naked?

824
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,042
Shit.

825
00:48:57,042 --> 00:49:00,587
I'm jumpin' in before everybody.
I don't give a fuck.

826
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,590
Girl: Take your fucking clothes off
and shut the fuck up, Harold.

827
00:49:13,182 --> 00:49:17,185
Motherfucker,
you know what I'm saying?

828
00:49:17,185 --> 00:49:20,146
Damn, Kim. Your body
looks fucking dope.

829
00:49:21,856 --> 00:49:23,608
You think so?

830
00:49:23,691 --> 00:49:25,109
Hells, yeah.
I'm serious, yo.

831
00:49:25,193 --> 00:49:28,112
It's funny, you don't know
how dope a girl's body is

832
00:49:28,154 --> 00:49:30,114
until she takes
all her clothes off.

833
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:32,658
It looks good, right?

834
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,868
Think it don't
when it does?

835
00:49:34,952 --> 00:49:37,037
Aw, you don't look
so bad yourself, Casper.

836
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,916
That shit is rare.
What about me?

837
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,961
That's what I like about you.
A girl's ass.

838
00:49:45,086 --> 00:49:48,047
Joy, ever seen
a black man's lasso?

839
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,508
Oh, my God!

840
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,557
Harold: Look at it.

841
00:50:00,558 --> 00:50:03,019
Girl: Harold's dick is black
and beautiful. Look at him.

842
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:05,688
All right. Chill.
Be quiet, be quiet.

843
00:50:12,111 --> 00:50:14,196
Look at that fuckin' shit.

844
00:50:14,196 --> 00:50:17,032
That's how I'm gonna be
up against your ass, like this.

845
00:50:22,745 --> 00:50:25,998
It's all gonna be against your ass.
I'm gonna be on the floor, like,

846
00:50:26,082 --> 00:50:27,583
down, break-break-breakin'
that shit.

847
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:31,170
- You know what I'm saying?
- We've seen enough, Harold.

848
00:50:31,212 --> 00:50:34,089
Harold: Break your back.
Break, break, break.

849
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,966
Hi-ho, Silver!

850
00:50:39,344 --> 00:50:42,764
Oh, shit!
That shit is cold.

851
00:50:42,889 --> 00:50:44,557
I'm going to piss in the pool.

852
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,768
I'm tellin' you,
somebody's gonna piss in it.

853
00:50:47,768 --> 00:50:49,437
What's that?

854
00:50:49,437 --> 00:50:51,897
Damn, girl,
that's my triple nipple.

855
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,237
You're gonna give me
goose bumps.

856
00:51:04,617 --> 00:51:06,994
I've been thinkin' about you
a lot lately.

857
00:51:06,994 --> 00:51:08,412
- You have?
- Yeah.

858
00:51:08,537 --> 00:51:11,081
- After I seen you last week.
- At the block party.

859
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:12,291
Yeah.

860
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,752
I was looking for you
all day today.

861
00:51:15,794 --> 00:51:17,504
You were?

862
00:51:17,546 --> 00:51:19,506
I thought about you
when I woke up.

863
00:51:22,217 --> 00:51:25,970
"Where could Darcy be at?"
I was looking all over.

864
00:51:26,053 --> 00:51:30,057
I'll give you a dollar
if you let me suck your tit.

865
00:51:30,057 --> 00:51:33,310
No, though, I'm serious.
Either of you guys.

866
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:36,104
What really makes you think
I'll let you suck my tits?

867
00:51:36,188 --> 00:51:39,649
I don't know. They're just
sittin' there all ripe and firm.

868
00:51:39,816 --> 00:51:41,943
It makes you want to
suck on them.

869
00:51:42,068 --> 00:51:43,569
Don't touch!

870
00:51:44,612 --> 00:51:46,113
Harold: Yeah, me too.

871
00:51:47,698 --> 00:51:49,617
Harold! Fuck you.

872
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,330
I thought you had a girlfriend.

873
00:51:55,539 --> 00:51:57,332
No, I ain't seeing nobody.

874
00:51:57,541 --> 00:51:58,917
What about you?

875
00:51:58,959 --> 00:52:02,170
I can't. My mom won't let me
have a boyfriend.

876
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,297
She won't?
Why not?

877
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,757
I don't know.

878
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,717
I guess it's 'cause
my sister Nicki...

879
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:10,136
had a baby when she was 15.

880
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:13,847
She was real young so my mom's
very protective over me.

881
00:52:13,889 --> 00:52:16,058
I can understand that.

882
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:20,812
They just look so fucking good.

883
00:52:20,812 --> 00:52:23,731
Yo, I truth or dare
you guys to kiss each other.

884
00:52:23,815 --> 00:52:26,400
Sure.
We do it all the time.

885
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:31,780
- Holy shit.
- Holy s... damn!

886
00:52:32,698 --> 00:52:34,741
Casper:
You guys are dykes, right?

887
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:35,742
Shit!

888
00:52:37,661 --> 00:52:39,913
- No.
- How can you kiss each other?

889
00:52:39,955 --> 00:52:41,331
How can you do that?

890
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:43,082
It don't matter.
It just feels good.

891
00:52:43,082 --> 00:52:44,208
It's not like we're gay.

892
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:46,586
It's just like kissing
another person, a friend.

893
00:52:46,711 --> 00:52:48,713
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

894
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:50,839
- Yeah, it's no big deal.
- Not at all.

895
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:52,758
I don't know.
I never seen...

896
00:52:52,841 --> 00:52:54,635
no shit like that
in my life.

897
00:52:54,635 --> 00:52:56,470
I think it looks nice,
though.

898
00:52:56,511 --> 00:52:59,306
- I know you think it's nice.
- Do it again.

899
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:01,015
Fuck outta here,
you guys.

900
00:53:01,057 --> 00:53:02,851
Come on.
One more time.

901
00:53:02,892 --> 00:53:04,602
Shut the fuck up.

902
00:53:04,644 --> 00:53:07,855
You just did it. How the fuck
you ain't gonna do it again?

903
00:53:07,938 --> 00:53:09,940
- Do it again.
- Joy, do it again.

904
00:53:09,982 --> 00:53:12,359
- Stop sweatin' it, you guys
- Suck her titty then.

905
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:14,361
Why don't you suck
each other's dicks?

906
00:53:14,403 --> 00:53:16,530
- I'm not gay.
- I'll fuck you up.

907
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,365
Why don't you kiss me,
then?

908
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:20,950
I don't want to kiss you.
You're not a girl.

909
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:22,660
Yes, I am.

910
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:24,787
- What's that?
- A clit.

911
00:53:24,912 --> 00:53:26,956
Harold will do anything
for a kiss.

912
00:53:27,081 --> 00:53:28,916
I don't want to kiss you,
Harold.

913
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:31,293
- Come on, just one kiss.
- You're so fuckin' aggressive.

914
00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:32,670
I got to represent.

915
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,129
Casper:
"It just feels good, that's all. "

916
00:53:34,254 --> 00:53:35,881
- Shut up.
- We're just friends.

917
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:37,466
You made me horny
right now.

918
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:40,093
Come on.
Why you gotta be like that?

919
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:41,219
Just one kiss.

920
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:47,600
Give her one kiss.
Come on, man.

921
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,103
Harold. Fuck you.

922
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,285
I say we go skinny-dipping, man.
Fuck this.

923
00:54:08,285 --> 00:54:10,454
- Let's just do it.
- Want to go skinny-dipping?

924
00:54:11,288 --> 00:54:14,249
You should come back
to Steven's house tonight.

925
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,792
Tonight?

926
00:54:15,834 --> 00:54:18,753
Come on. We'll bug out.
His parents are away.

927
00:54:18,837 --> 00:54:21,589
I don't know.
I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.

928
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:24,217
You can rave another night.
A bunch of people'll be there.

929
00:54:24,258 --> 00:54:25,843
- It'll be fun, I promise.
- Yeah?

930
00:54:27,053 --> 00:54:29,597
Come on, it'll be nice.
It'll be a change of pace.

931
00:54:29,597 --> 00:54:32,016
That club shit gets boring.

932
00:54:42,901 --> 00:54:44,152
Jenny!
What's up, girl?

933
00:54:44,235 --> 00:54:45,987
- How you doin'?
- Let's go.

934
00:54:53,494 --> 00:54:54,536
- Hey, Jenny.
- Hey.

935
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:36,033
How you doin'?
My name is Chi.

936
00:55:36,116 --> 00:55:37,242
Hi, Chi.

937
00:55:37,284 --> 00:55:38,618
All right, baby.

938
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:56,802
Jenny-Jen!
What's up?

939
00:55:57,969 --> 00:55:59,763
- How do you feel?
- What's goin' on?

940
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:01,681
Oh, shit!
I got to show you something.

941
00:56:01,765 --> 00:56:04,142
It's a spectacle.
It's a real spectacle.

942
00:56:04,142 --> 00:56:05,601
Jesus Christ, look at this!

943
00:56:12,941 --> 00:56:14,401
What's up?

944
00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:28,831
Holy,
they're still goin'!

945
00:56:28,956 --> 00:56:31,792
It's like amazing
sexual exploration!

946
00:56:32,584 --> 00:56:35,921
You don't have to look at us.
It's not a free show.

947
00:56:44,303 --> 00:56:45,138
Who are they?

948
00:56:45,304 --> 00:56:46,430
I don't know.

949
00:56:46,514 --> 00:56:49,266
I saw that one girl once before,
but she's like...

950
00:56:49,308 --> 00:56:52,102
like I don't know, like her face
is all mangled and shit.

951
00:56:52,186 --> 00:56:54,646
But they look like cornballs
from Jersey on Ecstasy,

952
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:56,064
feelin' the effects-tasy.

953
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:16,166
I got something for you.
Check it out.

954
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:18,168
It's a present.
It's a pres.

955
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,169
What is it?

956
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:20,670
It's a pres, Jenny-Jen.

957
00:57:21,754 --> 00:57:23,298
It's like bang-up stuff.

958
00:57:24,882 --> 00:57:27,301
Yeah, it's called
the euphoric blockbuster

959
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:29,595
and it's supposed
to make Special K look weak.

960
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,679
- Take it.
- I don't...

961
00:57:30,804 --> 00:57:33,098
You look sad. Take it.
Just swallow it.

962
00:57:33,182 --> 00:57:35,517
I promise.
Just swallow it.

963
00:57:35,642 --> 00:57:39,062
You swallow it, you be floatin'
up in heaven with the angels.

964
00:57:39,104 --> 00:57:41,064
You'll be singing
with Sammy Davis, Jr.

965
00:57:41,064 --> 00:57:43,650
You'll be kissing
Leo Gorcey on the chops.

966
00:57:43,733 --> 00:57:46,194
Don't you know, don't you know
Trix are for kids, silly?

967
00:57:52,533 --> 00:57:53,951
Fucking asshole.

968
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:09,256
Fuck that, nigga.

969
00:58:11,508 --> 00:58:13,844
I'm gonna throw a rocket
at your ass.

970
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,600
Yo, I got that fool.

971
00:59:07,018 --> 00:59:08,394
I got that one.

972
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:12,981
What's up, nigga?
Niggas is buggin'.

973
00:59:19,362 --> 00:59:22,157
- Ass crazed, ugly bitch.
- Ass crazed.

974
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:25,284
He said, he said, he said,
you're ass crazed.

975
00:59:25,284 --> 00:59:27,912
He said you're ass crazed.

976
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:29,080
What's up, yo?

977
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:33,292
Chillin', yo.

978
00:59:33,417 --> 00:59:36,086
Casper: What's a little nigga
like you doing drinking beer?

979
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:41,466
What's up, Trix?

980
00:59:41,633 --> 00:59:43,468
Gravediggers.

981
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,804
Who'd want to make out
with those nasty-ass bitches, huh?

982
00:59:49,682 --> 00:59:51,392
Them bitches that left.

983
00:59:51,433 --> 00:59:54,353
You don't know pussy
has no face, Javier.

984
00:59:54,353 --> 00:59:55,854
- Stoops.
- Come on, man.

985
00:59:55,937 --> 00:59:57,731
You've never seen a puss.

986
00:59:57,731 --> 00:59:59,733
I've seen a lot of puss.

987
01:00:03,069 --> 01:00:04,696
Hey, yo, Casper.

988
01:00:04,821 --> 01:00:06,697
- Why are you called Casper?
- It's my name.

989
01:00:06,781 --> 01:00:08,699
Nobody's real name
is Casper.

990
01:00:08,783 --> 01:00:10,284
That's my real name,
bitch.

991
01:00:10,284 --> 01:00:13,495
Why do you keep asking me
the same shit for?

992
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:16,456
Why don't you go lose
some fuckin' weight for anyway?

993
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,458
Ought to go
to Weight Watchers.

994
01:00:21,836 --> 01:00:24,589
Casper: Nick, what kind of bitches
do you like to fuck?

995
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:29,343
You like black bitches,
white bitches, what?

996
01:00:29,385 --> 01:00:32,221
- Anything. It don't matter.
- You like any old thing?

997
01:00:32,388 --> 01:00:33,388
What age?

998
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:40,311
- 16, 15...
- I bet you're a virgin now.

999
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:42,188
Well, bet whatever
you want to bet, then.

1000
01:00:42,313 --> 01:00:43,564
So when'd you hit it, yo?

1001
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:45,316
Don't worry about that.

1002
01:00:45,483 --> 01:00:48,444
How'd you hit it then.
Doggy? What? Never, right?

1003
01:00:48,486 --> 01:00:49,653
Probably a doggy.

1004
01:00:49,695 --> 01:00:51,488
You ever get a blow job?

1005
01:01:06,502 --> 01:01:08,587
Jenny, come on. Let's dance.
Come on, let's dance.

1006
01:01:08,671 --> 01:01:10,005
- What?
- Come on, let's dance.

1007
01:01:10,214 --> 01:01:12,257
I don't feel all right.
You seen Telly around?

1008
01:01:12,341 --> 01:01:14,384
Telly's at Steven's house
with a bunch of people.

1009
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:15,844
Come on, dance.

1010
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:17,721
- Telly's at Steven's?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1011
01:02:09,336 --> 01:02:11,337
Oh, shit.

1012
01:02:12,588 --> 01:02:15,091
Why won't you give me
the time of day, Gertie?

1013
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:16,050
Billy...

1014
01:02:16,092 --> 01:02:19,512
I love you, Gertie.
I feel like I love you.

1015
01:02:19,553 --> 01:02:22,639
You just best get yourself
out of my face, Billy.

1016
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:25,058
What do you mean, Gertie?
I love you.

1017
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:27,018
I want to do somethin' for you.

1018
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:31,231
I want to take you out to dinner.
I want to take you out to eat.

1019
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:34,609
Billy, take your
cracker ass out of my face.

1020
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:38,737
Gertie, I didn't mean it.
Gertie.

1021
01:02:38,779 --> 01:02:42,658
I want to buy you food,
corn dogs, anything.

1022
01:02:42,741 --> 01:02:44,910
Come on, baby.
Just one more kiss.

1023
01:02:44,951 --> 01:02:46,369
No, Harold, no.

1024
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:48,330
Come on, no.

1025
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:34,497
You know what I'm sayin'?

1026
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:37,249
I love you.
I want to get close to you.

1027
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:41,920
I want to, I want to feel you.
I want to be with you.

1028
01:03:42,045 --> 01:03:44,631
It's real like that.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1029
01:03:44,631 --> 01:03:47,133
I want to... I want to sleep
with you, Gertie.

1030
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,845
- Come on.
- No, no.

1031
01:03:59,186 --> 01:04:01,563
Where did you get that shit?

1032
01:04:01,563 --> 01:04:03,148
My brother.

1033
01:04:43,101 --> 01:04:46,188
That is some good weed
that your brother has.

1034
01:04:46,188 --> 01:04:48,356
Where does he get it at?

1035
01:04:48,565 --> 01:04:51,109
I don't know.
He won't tell me.

1036
01:04:51,151 --> 01:04:53,653
That sucks, your brother
won't tell you about it.

1037
01:04:53,694 --> 01:04:55,947
'Cause it's kinda whacked.

1038
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:59,241
If I knew where to get this,
I would get this every day.

1039
01:05:06,832 --> 01:05:07,958
Yo, Ham...

1040
01:05:09,542 --> 01:05:11,252
Pussy.

1041
01:05:11,419 --> 01:05:14,005
You takin' big hits
for a little guy.

1042
01:05:14,005 --> 01:05:15,464
You're a fiend,
that's why.

1043
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:19,134
And you got,
you got gold on your neck, too?

1044
01:05:19,218 --> 01:05:20,761
That's crazy.

1045
01:05:20,761 --> 01:05:22,930
That's nice.
Christ on your neck.

1046
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:24,931
That's nice.
I like that.

1047
01:05:31,145 --> 01:05:34,315
- Jesus Christ.
- You believe in Him?

1048
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:36,692
Yeah, I believe in Him.

1049
01:05:36,692 --> 01:05:38,819
That guy is the Saver, man.

1050
01:05:38,903 --> 01:05:40,654
He's cool.

1051
01:05:40,696 --> 01:05:41,905
Saved his life.

1052
01:05:45,867 --> 01:05:47,452
- What's up, Jeff?
- 'S up?

1053
01:05:48,036 --> 01:05:49,913
Chillin'.

1054
01:05:49,996 --> 01:05:52,999
My man fucked up right here.

1055
01:05:53,207 --> 01:05:54,584
Oh, shit.

1056
01:06:01,882 --> 01:06:04,134
Oh, shit.

1057
01:06:08,138 --> 01:06:12,767
That weed got you so fucked up
where you don't want to hit it?

1058
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:14,769
- That shit got me open.
- Yeah.

1059
01:06:14,769 --> 01:06:17,104
- Like it?
- Yeah, dig it, y'all.

1060
01:06:17,146 --> 01:06:19,315
It feels different,
like you're in another world...

1061
01:06:19,398 --> 01:06:22,109
like you zone out.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1062
01:06:22,192 --> 01:06:23,318
You're straight man.

1063
01:06:23,443 --> 01:06:25,821
You straight?

1064
01:06:25,821 --> 01:06:28,990
That's my limit.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1065
01:06:29,032 --> 01:06:30,450
The big hit man.

1066
01:06:30,492 --> 01:06:32,619
You know what I'm sayin'?
Big hit, baby.

1067
01:06:32,619 --> 01:06:35,037
Get high quick.
Big hits.

1068
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:36,914
I see the cherry go big, yo.

1069
01:06:36,998 --> 01:06:37,998
Word?

1070
01:06:38,082 --> 01:06:41,168
Steam that shit.
Big hit man.

1071
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:43,045
Big hit.

1072
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:46,882
Well, see, a person like me
smoke weed until I hallucinate.

1073
01:06:46,882 --> 01:06:48,383
I don't know why, either.

1074
01:06:48,508 --> 01:06:50,552
Crazy, right?

1075
01:06:50,635 --> 01:06:54,138
This party was dope,
but that shit got played quick.

1076
01:06:54,138 --> 01:06:56,140
But the bitches
are freaky here.

1077
01:06:56,307 --> 01:07:00,894
¢Ü Casper, the friendly ghost,
the friendly ghost ¢Ü

1078
01:07:00,894 --> 01:07:03,480
¢Ü The dopest ghost in town. ¢Ü

1079
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,609
¢Ü The bitches love me because
I'm fuckin' Casper ¢Ü

1080
01:07:07,651 --> 01:07:10,236
¢Ü The dopest ghost around. ¢Ü

1081
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,988
Fuck, yeah.

1082
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:17,785
I'm not gonna die.

1083
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:32,757
Do you like kissin' me?

1084
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,092
Yes.

1085
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:37,636
- Do you like me?
- U h-huh.

1086
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,306
I think you're like the best girl
I've ever kissed.

1087
01:07:54,652 --> 01:07:56,988
I couldn't stop thinking
about you

1088
01:07:57,029 --> 01:07:59,156
ever since I seen you
at the block party.

1089
01:07:59,198 --> 01:08:00,658
Come on.

1090
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:03,619
I'm serious.
I'm not jokin'.

1091
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:05,620
I just like you. That's all.

1092
01:08:05,704 --> 01:08:07,539
I like you, too.

1093
01:08:44,281 --> 01:08:46,533
Hey, yo, Steven.

1094
01:08:46,616 --> 01:08:48,451
Come on, man.
Steven!

1095
01:08:48,451 --> 01:08:49,911
What, man?

1096
01:08:49,953 --> 01:08:52,705
Let me in your parents' room.
Just for a while.

1097
01:08:52,747 --> 01:08:53,915
No, I can't, man.

1098
01:08:53,956 --> 01:08:55,917
Come on, man.
Hook me up.

1099
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:58,294
Do me this solid.

1100
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:01,130
Come on, man.
Yo, I gotta get Darcy alone, man.

1101
01:09:01,255 --> 01:09:03,799
She's gonna let me fuck her.

1102
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,052
All right, man. Just don't fuck
with anything, all right?

1103
01:09:07,135 --> 01:09:08,053
All right.

1104
01:09:55,638 --> 01:09:57,640
Telly, I'm nervous.

1105
01:09:58,808 --> 01:10:01,769
Trust me.
Don't be nervous.

1106
01:11:21,884 --> 01:11:23,260
Sorry.

1107
01:11:46,865 --> 01:11:49,451
I like you so much.

1108
01:11:49,534 --> 01:11:52,412
I think you're beautiful.

1109
01:11:52,412 --> 01:11:54,789
If we fucked,
you would love it.

1110
01:11:54,997 --> 01:11:57,291
You wouldn't believe it.

1111
01:11:57,416 --> 01:11:59,168
How do you know?

1112
01:12:01,962 --> 01:12:04,756
I just know.
You'll love it.

1113
01:12:06,007 --> 01:12:08,551
But I'm scared, Telly.

1114
01:12:10,011 --> 01:12:13,348
I'm tellin' you, there's nothin'
in the world to worry about.

1115
01:12:13,348 --> 01:12:15,099
Nothing?

1116
01:12:26,568 --> 01:12:27,736
Nothing.

1117
01:12:29,237 --> 01:12:32,407
I just want to make you
happy, that's all.

1118
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:34,700
Trust me.

1119
01:12:35,201 --> 01:12:38,412
I don't want you to hurt me.

1120
01:12:38,537 --> 01:12:40,581
You know it won't hurt.

1121
01:12:40,581 --> 01:12:42,541
I'll be gentle, I promise.

1122
01:12:44,209 --> 01:12:47,254
Do you care about me?

1123
01:12:47,337 --> 01:12:49,506
Of course I do.

1124
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:00,099
¢Ü The friendly ghost ¢Ü

1125
01:13:00,182 --> 01:13:04,061
¢Ü You know
I'm the dopest ghost in town. ¢Ü

1126
01:13:04,102 --> 01:13:09,232
¢Ü The bitches all love me
'cause I'm fuckin' Casper. ¢Ü

1127
01:13:09,232 --> 01:13:11,317
Fuckin' shit.

1128
01:13:11,401 --> 01:13:13,444
Casper.

1129
01:13:13,569 --> 01:13:14,904
What's up, Jenny?

1130
01:13:14,987 --> 01:13:17,531
What are you doin' here?
Long time no see.

1131
01:13:17,531 --> 01:13:18,741
Casper, where's Telly?

1132
01:13:18,782 --> 01:13:20,659
What do you want
with Telly for?

1133
01:13:20,743 --> 01:13:23,161
That guy's got
enough bitches.

1134
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:24,538
Where is he?

1135
01:13:26,081 --> 01:13:28,500
Well, don't look for him.
He's doin' fine.

1136
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:30,168
He got a girl.

1137
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:34,297
He's fucking her right now
in Steven's parents' room.

1138
01:13:35,756 --> 01:13:38,217
So what you know, Joe?

1139
01:13:42,638 --> 01:13:45,349
What's she lookin' worried
about that nigga for, huh?

1140
01:13:46,641 --> 01:13:50,270
Oh, Ham.
Hit this yo. Ham.

1141
01:13:59,904 --> 01:14:02,197
Telly, it hurts.

1142
01:14:03,949 --> 01:14:05,784
That's it.
You're doin' fine.

1143
01:14:05,784 --> 01:14:07,953
Come on.
Come on. That's it.

1144
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,797
That's it.
You're doin' fine.

1145
01:14:19,838 --> 01:14:22,591
Come on, Darcy.
That's it.

1146
01:14:34,519 --> 01:14:36,604
Telly, it hurts.
Ow.

1147
01:14:36,646 --> 01:14:39,148
Come on, Darcy.
That's it. Come on.

1148
01:14:41,942 --> 01:14:43,735
Shut the fuckin' door!

1149
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:52,215
What's up, Ham?

1150
01:16:57,233 --> 01:16:59,109
Lucky fuckin' bastard.

1151
01:18:01,792 --> 01:18:03,669
Hey, Jenny, wake up.

1152
01:18:06,963 --> 01:18:08,715
Hey, Jenny, wake up.

1153
01:18:26,106 --> 01:18:27,816
Jenny, wake up.

1154
01:19:58,983 --> 01:20:00,901
Don't worry, Jenny.
It's me, Casper.

1155
01:20:01,985 --> 01:20:03,737
Don't worry, Jenny.

1156
01:20:14,539 --> 01:20:15,706
Jenny: No.

1157
01:20:15,748 --> 01:20:17,583
Shh. Shh.

1158
01:20:27,592 --> 01:20:28,843
Shh.

1159
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:40,396
It's me, Casper.
Don't worry.

1160
01:21:53,755 --> 01:21:55,339
Shh...

1161
01:21:57,508 --> 01:21:58,843
Don't.

1162
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:24,416
Telly: When you're young,
not much matters.

1163
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,501
When you find something
that you care about,

1164
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:28,420
then that's all you got.

1165
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:31,506
When you go to sleep at night,
you dream of pussy.

1166
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,716
When you wake up,
it's the same thing.

1167
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:36,802
It's there in your face.
You can't escape it.

1168
01:23:36,886 --> 01:23:38,304
Sometimes when you're young,

1169
01:23:38,512 --> 01:23:40,264
the only place to go is inside.

1170
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:43,267
That's just it.
Fuckin' is what I love.

1171
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:46,061
Take that away from me
and I really got nothin'.

1172
01:23:53,234 --> 01:23:55,236
Jesus Christ,
what happened?
