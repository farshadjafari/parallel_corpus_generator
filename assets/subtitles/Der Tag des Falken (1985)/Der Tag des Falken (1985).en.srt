1
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:05,670
<i>Impossible...</i>

2
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:08,006
<i>Nothing is impossible...</i>

3
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,134
<i>Come on, Mouse.</i>

4
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:12,843
<i>Dig!</i>

5
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:15,346
<i>Dig...</i>

6
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:18,348
<i>Mouse.</i>

7
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,069
- Jehan.
- Yes, sir?

8
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,770
Get the next 3.

9
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:03,465
2 more..

10
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,105
- Over there.
- Hurry up.

11
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:16,318
Take 2. I want Phillipe Gaston.

12
00:04:16,318 --> 00:04:18,112
This is the cell, sir.

13
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:29,747
Wrong cell. I want Phillipe Gaston,
the one they call "The Mouse".

14
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:32,959
The Mouse? The Mouse…

15
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:39,548
The Mouse- he left our house.

16
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,093
No Mouse today- he ran away.

17
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:47,889
To ease the pain- he's down the drain!

18
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:51,559
- Where is he?!
- I already told you, gentle Lord!

19
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:55,729
Hang him. Search every sewer,
every drain!

20
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,441
Find him! Or Captain Marquet
will hang you in his place.

21
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:04,070
Impossible. Nobody could
escape through there.

22
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:16,832
It's not unlike escaping
mother's womb.

23
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:19,710
God, what a memory!

24
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:17,221
Lord, I'll never pick another pocket
as long as I live, I swear.

25
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:21,641
But here's the problem- if you won't let
me live, how can I prove my good faith to you?

26
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:26,146
If you've heard me, this ledge
will remain steady as a rock,

27
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:29,732
and that thing coming at me
won't be what I think it is.

28
00:06:29,732 --> 00:06:34,403
If it is, there'll be no hard feelings,
of course... but I'll be very disappointed.

29
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:40,075
I don't believe it...

30
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:46,289
I believe it.

31
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,213
I'm coming.

32
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,091
It's Phillipe, Lord.

33
00:06:58,175 --> 00:06:59,426
Phillipe.

34
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:21,738
You won't regret this, Lord.
I'm a wonderful person.

35
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:33,874
Hello! What are you
doing down there?

36
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:36,252
Get away, get away!

37
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:38,295
Come there, come there.

38
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:44,314
There's disturbing news, Your Grace.
One of the prisoners has escaped.

39
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:49,235
No one ever escapes the
dungeons of Aquila, Marquet.

40
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:52,113
The people of the city accept
that as a historical fact.

41
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:56,075
- The responsibility is mine.
- Yes.

42
00:08:57,493 --> 00:09:00,037
It would be a miracle...

43
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:03,290
if he manages to get through
the sewage system.

44
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:06,042
I believe in miracles, Marquet.

45
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:08,795
It's part of my job.

46
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:14,341
At any rate, Your Grace, ‘tis only
one insignificant petty thief.

47
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,720
Great storms announce themselves
with a simple breeze, Captain,

48
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:21,723
and a single rebel spark can
ignite the fires of rebellion.

49
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:26,019
If he's out there, Your Grace,
I shall find him.

50
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:27,896
Yes.

51
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:46,287
Take 10 men toward Chanee,
we ride north to Gabroche.

52
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:48,957
The name of the man who
finds this Gaston...

53
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:53,006
will be brought to the personal
attention of the Bishop...

54
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:56,255
as will the body of the
man who lets him get away.

55
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:58,590
Open the gate!

56
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:42,422
I know I promised, Lord, never again.

57
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:47,468
But I also know, that you know,
what a weak-willed person I am.

58
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,751
Come on, Mouse, keep going.
Not much further.

59
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:27,755
About 350 miles, that's all.

60
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:35,270
A nice hot piece of cabbage, like
my dear old mother used to cook.

61
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:39,474
Wolf! Wolf.

62
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:42,144
Please, no wolf.

63
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:46,606
Extract of lamb.

64
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,277
Where the hell am I?

65
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,904
Hot lamb, with sauce on it.

66
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,909
Maybe some of that green stuff,
that Bertram used to put on.

67
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,400
Come on. Get out of here.

68
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:30,897
- Hello!
- Hello!

69
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:32,481
- Hello!
- Look up there!

70
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:36,694
He's taking daddy's shoes!

71
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:38,487
You've got it, little darlings.

72
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:11,475
Innkeeper.

73
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:16,522
- A drink of your most expensive!
- Yeah, yeah, show me your money.

74
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,484
Copper, my friend.

75
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:24,404
And a same for any who
joins me in a toast!

76
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:26,531
Let's hear your toast.

77
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:31,077
We drink to a special man,
my friends.

78
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:36,040
Someone who has seen the dungeons
of Aquila, and lived to tell the tale.

79
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,002
Then you drink to me, little man.
I've seen those dungeons.

80
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,920
A blacksmith, perhaps?

81
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:47,634
A carpenter? A stonecutter, even?
But a prisoner, from inside Aquila?

82
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:49,886
I didn't say I was a prisoner.

83
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,977
If you'd stuck to the woods, you
may have stood a chance, Gaston.

84
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:00,229
You're right.

85
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:02,522
Get him!

86
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,900
Move, move! 

87
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:26,419
Get out of the way!

88
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:30,089
You, I said out!

89
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:27,892
I'm so terribly sorry!

90
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:32,980
Kill him.

91
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:41,446
May God have mercy on my soul!

92
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:57,127
You, out.

93
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:15,102
One of my men told me
you returned.

94
00:16:15,728 --> 00:16:17,688
I wanted to cut his
throat for lying...

95
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:20,482
because I knew you
weren't that stupid.

96
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:27,864
- Captain Navarre.
- Francesco.

97
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:32,326
Captain?

98
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:54,000
Navarre!

99
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:03,726
I won't hurt you,
I'm a wonderful person.

100
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:08,064
After him!

101
00:18:09,307 --> 00:18:13,685
Easy, sweet ponies, come here…
you filthy strumpets!

102
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,689
No, no!

103
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,490
No!

104
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:22,149
Must be somebody at home.
I see smoke.

105
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:27,362
Are you sure you don't want to ride on, sir?
There's still plenty of light.

106
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:31,015
Stop your chattering.
We'll spend the night here.

107
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:32,082
Pitou!

108
00:19:39,706 --> 00:19:40,791
Pitou!

109
00:19:45,587 --> 00:19:47,297
Give me the axe! The axe!

110
00:19:47,422 --> 00:19:52,801
Good afternoon, sir, my lady. My comrade-in-arms
and I need lodging for the night.

111
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:57,889
- No, no place for you here.
- We'll pay for it, of course.

112
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,893
We are not above compassion
for those in misery.

113
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:10,025
You may sleep down
there, in a barn.

114
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:11,385
Thank you.

115
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:02,615
Sir?

116
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:05,201
Sir, are you there?

117
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:09,000
If there's nothing else
I can do, I think I'll turn in.

118
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:12,041
- You can take care of my horse.
-All right.

119
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,419
And sleep with one eye open.

120
00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:20,673
And don't disturb me- I'm liable to take
your head off before I know it's you.

121
00:21:21,424 --> 00:21:22,592
All right. Come on, old girl.

122
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:25,178
Come on.

123
00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:29,056
Stubborn little lady!
What's her name?

124
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:32,059
His name is Goliath.

125
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,770
His name? Pretty name.

126
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,280
Go with him, boy, he didn't
mean to hurt your feelings.

127
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:43,236
Goliath, before we get to
know each other better...

128
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:47,239
I feel I should tell you a story about
a teeny little man named David.

129
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:07,550
One day.

130
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:24,232
"Comrade-in-arms"!

131
00:22:24,982 --> 00:22:26,609
"Slave" is more like it.

132
00:22:27,234 --> 00:22:30,821
See to the fire, feed the
animals, gather the wood...

133
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:34,408
Look at me, Lord!

134
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:37,410
I was better off at the
dungeons of Aquila!

135
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,164
My cellmate was insane,
and a murderer...

136
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:43,333
but he respected me!

137
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:49,880
He's a strange one, Navarre. Why did he
save my life? He wants something from me.

138
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:52,549
I can see it in his eyes.

139
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:58,346
Well, whatever it is,
I'm not going to do it!

140
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:02,225
I'm still a young man, you know!
I've got prospects!

141
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:07,229
I'm off to find my golden future,
Captain, so goodbye and good...

142
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:25,163
Hello?

143
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,298
Who do you think is out there?

144
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,718
You better draw your sword, Pierre.

145
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:44,764
Ah, Louis, you brought
your crossbow!

146
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:48,684
We'll all go back to
the barn now, all right?

147
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:50,644
- All right.
- All right.

148
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:58,777
Show no mercy, Pierre!
Take no prisoners!

149
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:01,154
I'm going to get some help!

150
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,364
Captain, sir, Captain!

151
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:39,864
Sir! Sir!

152
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:42,692
Wolf!

153
00:24:43,526 --> 00:24:45,111
Sir!

154
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:48,989
Wolf!

155
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:30,903
Don't go out there,
don't go out there!

156
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:35,365
There's a wolf, a big wolf, the biggest
wolf you've ever seen, and a dead man.

157
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:36,241
I know.

158
00:25:44,374 --> 00:25:46,250
Miss, please!

159
00:25:56,676 --> 00:25:58,094
Maybe I'm dreaming.

160
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:03,725
But my eyes are open, which
means, maybe I'm awake...

161
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:05,643
dreaming I'm asleep.

162
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:07,687
Or, or more likely...

163
00:26:07,937 --> 00:26:11,565
maybe I'm asleep,
dreaming I'm awake...

164
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:13,192
wondering if I'm dreaming.

165
00:26:13,192 --> 00:26:14,860
<i>You are dreaming.</i>

166
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,480
I've not seen what I've just seen.
I do not believe what I believe, Lord.

167
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,902
If these are magical or unexplainable matters,
then I beg you not to make me a part of them.

168
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,526
We'll stop now.

169
00:27:47,528 --> 00:27:49,488
Not a great day for traveling.

170
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:53,492
Come on, girl, come on.

171
00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:56,078
I mean, boy. Come on, Goliath. Come on.

172
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,623
Goliath, come on, it's cold
out here. Come on.

173
00:28:05,378 --> 00:28:09,089
I can do with a rest myself,
after last night's goings on.

174
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,428
The wolf would have kill me,
it was horrible.

175
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:19,224
But he tore the farmer's
throat out, and left me alone.

176
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,479
And there was more.

177
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:27,023
There was a woman...

178
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:31,068
like fine porcelain,
with deep blue eyes...

179
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:33,445
almost like a bird's.

180
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:38,158
And her voice...

181
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,285
the dulcet tones of an angel.

182
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,414
She spoke? What did she say?

183
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:49,126
I asked her if I was dreaming,
and she said I was.

184
00:28:50,878 --> 00:28:54,089
I'm not insane, you must believe
me when I tell you these things!

185
00:28:54,214 --> 00:28:58,176
No, I believe you.
I believe in dreams.

186
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:00,387
I see.

187
00:29:02,263 --> 00:29:05,892
This lady… Did she
perhaps have a name?

188
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:08,519
Not that she mentioned, why?

189
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:13,815
Well, she may wonder
into my dreams.

190
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,027
Wouldn't it be nice...

191
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:20,989
if I could call her by name and
pretend we've met before?

192
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:30,164
I've waited a long
time for such a lady.

193
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:35,043
Now get some sleep.

194
00:29:43,176 --> 00:29:45,845
The bird will alert
us if anyone comes.

195
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,976
I got to be out of my mind.

196
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:55,646
Out of my mind.

197
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,500
Open the gates!

198
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,500
<i>Open the gates!</i>

199
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:23,142
Have you found the
criminal, Gaston?

200
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:25,978
He's not in my custody
at this time.

201
00:31:25,978 --> 00:31:28,605
Then why do you invade my
garden, unwashed, unshaved?

202
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:30,357
Do you think to find him here?

203
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:35,195
Navarre has returned.

204
00:31:42,326 --> 00:31:43,744
Walk with me.

205
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:59,342
The criminal, Gaston, travels with him.
My men are combing the woods.

206
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:00,968
And the hawk?

207
00:32:01,135 --> 00:32:03,888
- Your Grace?
- There must be a hawk.

208
00:32:04,597 --> 00:32:06,682
A spirited hawk.

209
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,227
This one is not to be
harmed, understood?

210
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:13,938
You see, the day she dies, a new Captain of
the Guard will preside at your execution.

211
00:32:15,148 --> 00:32:17,775
We live in difficult times, Marquet.

212
00:32:19,235 --> 00:32:21,904
This famine has prevented people from
paying their proper tribute to the church.

213
00:32:21,904 --> 00:32:25,574
I raise their taxes, only to be told
there's nothing left for me to tax.

214
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:31,538
Imagine! But last night, the Lord
Almighty visited me in my sleep.

215
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:33,164
He told me...

216
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:38,294
that Satan's messenger is traveling
amongst us. And his name...

217
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:41,297
is Etienne of Navarre.

218
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:43,924
Go.

219
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:47,636
To break faith with me is
to break faith with Him.

220
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:59,355
- Get me Cezar!
- Yes, Your Grace.

221
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:29,216
This sword has been in my
family for 5 generations.

222
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:33,011
It has never known
defeat, until now.

223
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,307
This jewel represents
my family name.

224
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:41,310
This one is our alliance with
the Holy Church in Rome.

225
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:44,897
This one… was my father's...

226
00:33:45,939 --> 00:33:47,316
from the Crusades.

227
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,318
And this...

228
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:52,737
Sir, you don't think that I took that one...

229
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:54,906
This is mine to fill.

230
00:33:56,741 --> 00:34:00,328
Each generation is called
upon to follow its own quest.

231
00:34:00,328 --> 00:34:02,329
And what is your quest?

232
00:34:04,206 --> 00:34:06,333
I must kill a man.

233
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,753
Tell me, does this walking
corpse have a name?

234
00:34:13,256 --> 00:34:14,883
His Grace...

235
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:17,135
the Bishop of Aquila.

236
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:19,762
The Bishop... I see.

237
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:26,477
Well, then you have much to do.

238
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:29,062
And I've already been
enough of a burden to you.

239
00:34:30,063 --> 00:34:32,983
I do hope our paths cross again one day.

240
00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:35,026
I need you to guide me into the city.

241
00:34:35,026 --> 00:34:36,903
Not for the life of my mother!

242
00:34:36,903 --> 00:34:38,946
Even if I knew who she was..

243
00:34:39,113 --> 00:34:41,032
You're the only one who has
ever escaped from there.

244
00:34:41,032 --> 00:34:46,161
It was chance, pure chance, a miracle.
Once in a life time.

245
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:48,247
I fell down a hole and followed my nose.

246
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:56,337
I have waited almost 2 years
for a sign from God.

247
00:34:56,337 --> 00:34:59,507
So when I heard the
warning bells of Aquila...

248
00:34:59,757 --> 00:35:04,887
I knew the moment of my destiny has
come. You will be my guiding angel.

249
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:05,929
Me?

250
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:12,978
Sir, the truth is, I talk to God all the time,
and no offense, but he never mentioned you.

251
00:35:13,103 --> 00:35:14,437
No?

252
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:18,024
There are strange forces
at work in your life.

253
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:20,651
Magical ones that surround you.

254
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,196
I don't understand them,
but they frighten me.

255
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:27,366
You have given me my life.

256
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:30,577
The truth is, I can never repay you.

257
00:35:30,577 --> 00:35:33,121
I have no honor, and never will have.

258
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:38,292
I don't think that you'd kill
me for being what I am.

259
00:35:40,086 --> 00:35:44,506
But, better that then to return to Aquila.

260
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:59,812
I'll gather some wood for the fire.

261
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:19,455
- Got you.
- Miss?

262
00:36:21,123 --> 00:36:23,250
My lady, up here.

263
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:25,836
Oh, damn.

264
00:36:26,378 --> 00:36:27,796
Do you remember me?

265
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,215
What are you doing up there?

266
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:34,094
What am I doing? Well, yes,
you might ask that.

267
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:36,763
The Bishop's guards.

268
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:39,182
A dozen of them,
we had a terrible fight.

269
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:42,309
- Why didn't they kill you.
- Why didn't they?..

270
00:36:42,727 --> 00:36:46,397
It's a good question,
I asked them that myself.

271
00:36:46,563 --> 00:36:48,815
- And?..
- And?

272
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:50,692
And what did they say?

273
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:55,655
They said that... that they prefer
to leave that honor to the Bishop.

274
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:59,242
They're coming back.

275
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:02,620
- They are, are they?
- Please, my lady?

276
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,248
A giant owl examined me
closely not one minute ago.

277
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:10,794
Please?

278
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:15,965
Please?

279
00:37:23,597 --> 00:37:25,140
You're very kind.

280
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:36,901
Listen,..

281
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:43,657
<i>Thank you very much, my lady. Tell the
Captain he ties a wicked knot!</i>

282
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:48,036
He's gonna kill me.

283
00:37:58,546 --> 00:37:59,922
Good morning!

284
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:03,634
Let's go find Phillipe.

285
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:16,729
Well, well.

286
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:20,066
Long way from the
sewers, little rat.

287
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,527
This time, the drinks are on me.

288
00:38:24,737 --> 00:38:27,698
- Where is Navarre?
- Navarre? Navarre?

289
00:38:28,615 --> 00:38:31,159
Oh, yes, yes, big man,
black horse.

290
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,579
I saw him riding
south, toward Aquila.

291
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,290
Then we ride north, sir.

292
00:38:37,457 --> 00:38:41,502
It's not polite to assume that somebody
is a liar when you've only just met him.

293
00:38:41,669 --> 00:38:44,004
Yet you knew we would.

294
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:49,301
We ride south. Toward Aquila.

295
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:51,678
I told the truth, Lord!

296
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:55,765
How can I learn any moral lessons,
when you keep confusing me like this?

297
00:40:11,585 --> 00:40:13,086
Hawke!

298
00:40:15,588 --> 00:40:16,673
No.

299
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:13,767
Easy, you'll be all right.

300
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:25,653
Get me a piece of cloth
from my saddlebag!

301
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:30,014
Easy, don't be afraid, it's all right.

302
00:41:30,915 --> 00:41:32,115
It's all right.

303
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:37,538
Thanks.

304
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:42,251
You'll be all right.
You will be fine.

305
00:41:43,169 --> 00:41:45,296
You'll live.

306
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:49,966
Take her, find help.

307
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:52,969
- Me, sir?
- You're the only one I have.

308
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,972
- But sir, the hawk is done for.
- Don't you say that!

309
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:02,019
Follow this road.
You'll find a ruined castle.

310
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:06,315
There's a monk named Imperious. Give
him the hawk. He will know what to do.

311
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,859
- Sir, I don't think you understand...
- Get on my horse.

312
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,361
You're the only one who can ride him.

313
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:14,739
You will do what I tell you.
Get on my horse, now!

314
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:25,332
Careful.

315
00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:29,628
And know this...

316
00:42:29,628 --> 00:42:33,006
if you fail, I will follow
you the length of my days.

317
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,133
And I will find you.

318
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,052
Go.

319
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:41,222
Go.

320
00:43:13,043 --> 00:43:16,754
There it is, see? The castle.
We'll be there soon.

321
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,760
Ah! Well, well, that's
gratitude for you!

322
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:28,182
All right, let this Imperious watch you die.
I've got my own life to look after!

323
00:43:39,192 --> 00:43:40,318
Please.

324
00:43:48,534 --> 00:43:49,159
Hello!

325
00:43:51,661 --> 00:43:53,163
Hello up there!

326
00:43:53,747 --> 00:43:55,457
For pitty sake, hello!

327
00:43:56,165 --> 00:43:58,668
Hello, hello!

328
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,337
What do you want down there?

329
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,759
- I was told to bring you this bird. It's been wounded.
- Oh, good shot!

330
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:11,471
- Bring her in, we'll dine together.
- We can't eat this bird.

331
00:44:11,847 --> 00:44:15,141
Oh, why not... Oh, God,
is it lent again already?!

332
00:44:16,017 --> 00:44:21,355
This is no ordinary hawk, Father.
It belongs to a man named Navarre.

333
00:44:21,689 --> 00:44:25,484
Mother of God! Bring her in,
bring her in!

334
00:44:31,448 --> 00:44:32,407
Stay.

335
00:44:33,408 --> 00:44:34,576
Good bird.

336
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,788
Up here, boy! Hurry.

337
00:44:39,038 --> 00:44:39,997
Hurry!

338
00:44:45,961 --> 00:44:47,880
Hurry! Here, up here.

339
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:49,923
This way.

340
00:44:51,424 --> 00:44:56,200
Now, careful. Walk on the left side.
On the left.

341
00:45:05,979 --> 00:45:06,939
There.

342
00:45:18,157 --> 00:45:19,575
Gently...

343
00:45:23,162 --> 00:45:24,205
Gently.

344
00:45:34,672 --> 00:45:36,090
Now, leave us.

345
00:45:36,382 --> 00:45:38,593
- Can I help?
- Go out, boy.

346
00:45:48,477 --> 00:45:49,603
Don't be frightened.

347
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,189
Navarre was right.

348
00:45:52,897 --> 00:45:55,024
I know what to do.

349
00:45:59,153 --> 00:46:01,072
We must wait a little.

350
00:46:15,835 --> 00:46:17,837
Now, then, where is it?

351
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:19,838
Oh, yes, there we are.

352
00:46:20,631 --> 00:46:22,758
Now, what we're gonna need?

353
00:46:22,758 --> 00:46:27,429
Some tarragon, rosemary,
wood for the fire...

354
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:44,612
It's late. Time, I need time.

355
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:48,056
Now, there, that's it...

356
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,838
Navarre, is he?..

357
00:47:05,798 --> 00:47:06,882
He's fine.

358
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,702
He's just fine, my lady.

359
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:16,832
There was a terrible battle.
Navarre fought like a lion.

360
00:47:20,419 --> 00:47:21,378
The hawk...

361
00:47:23,213 --> 00:47:25,799
The hawk was struck.

362
00:47:28,385 --> 00:47:30,970
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

363
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:38,185
Are you flesh?

364
00:47:39,812 --> 00:47:41,522
Or are you spirit?

365
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:46,276
I am sorrow.

366
00:47:53,991 --> 00:47:55,284
How?

367
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:17,305
Now, get out.

368
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:19,640
Get out.

369
00:48:20,516 --> 00:48:22,810
This time, stay out!

370
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,700
Ready?

371
00:49:30,497 --> 00:49:33,166
Forgive me, Your Grace.
Cezar has arrived.

372
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:10,492
It's him, isn't it?

373
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:14,662
- The wolf, somehow, it's him.
- Drink, forget!

374
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:17,665
An hour ago you were drunk,
and you remembered.

375
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,543
- What do they call you, boy?
- Phillipe Gaston.

376
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:28,300
Her name is Isabeau D'Anjou.

377
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:32,804
Her father was the count D'Anjou,
an ill-tempered fellow.

378
00:50:32,804 --> 00:50:35,932
He died slaying Saracens in Antioch.

379
00:50:36,932 --> 00:50:42,563
She came to live, with her cousin
I think it was, in Aquila.

380
00:50:43,564 --> 00:50:48,485
I shall never forget the first time
I saw her. It was like looking at...

381
00:50:48,485 --> 00:50:49,944
The face of love.

382
00:50:50,945 --> 00:50:53,114
Ah, you too?

383
00:50:53,114 --> 00:50:57,076
Well, I suppose we were all in
love with her in different ways.

384
00:50:57,076 --> 00:51:00,120
Even His Grace, the Bishop,
couldn't think of nothing else.

385
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,497
The Bishop loved her?!

386
00:51:01,497 --> 00:51:06,126
As near as that evil
man could come to it.

387
00:51:06,126 --> 00:51:10,255
His passion was a sort of madness.
He was a man possessed!

388
00:51:10,255 --> 00:51:13,549
But Isabeau sensed his wickedness,
and she shrank from him.

389
00:51:13,549 --> 00:51:17,720
She sent back all his letters
and left his poems unread.

390
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,723
Her heart was already
lost, you see...

391
00:51:20,889 --> 00:51:23,350
to the Captain of the Guard.

392
00:51:24,977 --> 00:51:27,145
Etienne Navarre!

393
00:51:27,145 --> 00:51:29,356
The Bishop knew nothing
about their love.

394
00:51:29,356 --> 00:51:33,526
But every day he saw it grow
stronger and deeper and richer.

395
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:35,945
Until...

396
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:51,125
Until?

397
00:51:54,837 --> 00:51:56,339
They were betrayed.

398
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:03,554
They shared the same confessor,
a weak, foolish priest.

399
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:09,142
On one day, on a drunken confession to
his superior, he committed a mortal sin.

400
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:13,313
He revealed the lovers' secret
vows to the Bishop.

401
00:52:14,814 --> 00:52:17,608
The old fool didn't realize
what he had done at first...

402
00:52:17,858 --> 00:52:20,319
or the terrible revenge
the Bishop would exact.

403
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:24,740
His Grace seemed to go mad, he lost
both his sanctity and his reason.

404
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:29,703
He swore, that if he could not
have her, no man would.

405
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:35,541
So, Navarre and Isabeau
fled from Aquila.

406
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:41,839
The Bishop followed, ever more ardent,
ever more persistent than a hound.

407
00:52:42,714 --> 00:52:45,592
An evil man, a powerful
man, hated and feared;

408
00:52:45,926 --> 00:52:47,886
Rejected even by Rome itself.

409
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:52,140
He called upon the
powers of darkness...

410
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:55,601
for the means to
damn the lovers.

411
00:52:55,810 --> 00:53:01,482
In his fury and frustration,
he struck a dreadful bargain...

412
00:53:03,859 --> 00:53:05,944
with the Evil One

413
00:53:09,364 --> 00:53:11,491
The dark powers of hell...

414
00:53:11,741 --> 00:53:15,786
spat up a terrible curse,
and you have seen it working.

415
00:53:16,454 --> 00:53:21,542
By day, Isabeau is the beautiful
bird you brought to me.

416
00:53:21,542 --> 00:53:25,379
And by night, as you
have already guessed...

417
00:53:26,421 --> 00:53:28,840
the voice of the wolf that we hear...

418
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,177
is the cry of Navarre.

419
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:37,723
Poor dumb creatures, with no memory of
the half-life of their human existence

420
00:53:37,723 --> 00:53:40,184
never touching in the flesh.

421
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:44,563
Only the anguish of a split
second at sunrise and sunset...

422
00:53:44,563 --> 00:53:47,607
when they can almost touch...

423
00:53:48,149 --> 00:53:50,068
but not.

424
00:53:50,443 --> 00:53:54,697
always together... eternally apart...

425
00:53:55,031 --> 00:54:00,369
As long as the sun rises and sets,
as long as there is day and night

426
00:54:01,286 --> 00:54:04,748
and for as long as they both shall live.

427
00:54:09,044 --> 00:54:13,339
You have stumbled onto a
tragic story, Phillipe Gaston.

428
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:17,301
And now, whether you like it or not...

429
00:54:17,301 --> 00:54:21,055
you are lost in it, with the rest of us.

430
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:52,792
Useless.

431
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:54,293
All of them.

432
00:54:54,627 --> 00:54:56,754
My traps are full.

433
00:54:56,879 --> 00:55:02,342
I can't kill every wolf that lives. Since the
plague there are more wolves then men.

434
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,012
And there is a woman.

435
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:06,930
Your Grace?

436
00:55:09,641 --> 00:55:11,476
A beautiful woman...

437
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:17,648
with alabaster skin, and
the eyes of a dove.

438
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:25,280
She travels by night, only by
night. Her sun is the moon.

439
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,490
And her name is...

440
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,745
Isabeau.

441
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,083
Find her, and you find the wolf.

442
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,710
The wolf I want.

443
00:55:40,711 --> 00:55:42,129
The wolf who...

444
00:55:44,256 --> 00:55:45,841
loves her.

445
00:55:48,843 --> 00:55:50,553
A black wolf.

446
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,726
Isabeau.

447
00:56:13,908 --> 00:56:14,659
Don't...

448
00:56:16,702 --> 00:56:18,704
You might start bleeding again.

449
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:26,795
Tell me your name.

450
00:56:28,088 --> 00:56:30,924
Most people call me
Phillipe "The Mouse"

451
00:56:32,008 --> 00:56:33,968
You travel with him, don't you?

452
00:56:35,761 --> 00:56:36,661
Yes.

453
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:55,988
"You must save this hawk",
he said.

454
00:56:56,155 --> 00:57:01,493
"For she is my life, my last
and best reason for living".

455
00:57:05,747 --> 00:57:07,665
And then he said:

456
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,878
"One day we will know such happiness...

457
00:57:12,878 --> 00:57:16,465
as 2 people dream of, but never do".

458
00:57:23,221 --> 00:57:24,973
He said that?

459
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:28,935
I swear it on my life.

460
00:57:55,229 --> 00:57:57,731
- Does she know?
- What?

461
00:57:58,774 --> 00:58:01,443
That you are the priest
that betrayed them.

462
00:58:01,443 --> 00:58:04,321
The Lord has declared
an end to it at last.

463
00:58:04,321 --> 00:58:07,782
He has given me the knowledge
to undo what I have done.

464
00:58:07,907 --> 00:58:11,577
After 2 years, he has brought
us back together again.

465
00:58:12,995 --> 00:58:15,539
Make yourself clear, if you can.

466
00:58:17,124 --> 00:58:20,586
I have found a way
to break the curse...

467
00:58:20,586 --> 00:58:23,588
and a time for Navarre
to confront the Bishop...

468
00:58:23,588 --> 00:58:25,632
and to begin his own true life again.

469
00:58:25,882 --> 00:58:29,594
He intends to confront the Bishop, to kill
him with the sword of his ancestors.

470
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:34,015
No, he mustn't do that! He can't! If he kills
the Bishop, the curse can never be broken!

471
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:39,853
Look after Isabeau, boy!
Go, quickly!

472
00:58:47,677 --> 00:58:51,114
Open up the door, in the name of
His Holiness the Bishop of Aquila!

473
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:56,035
Ah, away with you! This is a
house of God, not a brothel!

474
00:58:56,035 --> 00:58:57,870
I said, open up, in the
name of the Bishop!

475
00:58:58,203 --> 00:59:02,833
I've met the Bishop, you blasphemous
lout! And you look nothing like him!

476
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:05,210
- Break it in!
- Yes, sir.

477
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:08,671
Left side, left side.

478
00:59:14,427 --> 00:59:15,678
Come On!

479
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:20,641
My lady.

480
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,392
Come with me.

481
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,603
- What is it?
- Don't talk, come with me.

482
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,024
Sorry!

483
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,610
I am a monk, not an architect!

484
00:59:41,618 --> 00:59:43,120
Move it in here!

485
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:48,875
In here, my lady.

486
00:59:55,214 --> 00:59:58,008
This way, my son, straight
to the big main doors.

487
00:59:58,842 --> 01:00:00,052
And don't forget...

488
01:00:07,183 --> 01:00:09,811
walk on the left side.

489
01:00:19,486 --> 01:00:21,154
Careful...

490
01:00:27,994 --> 01:00:30,830
Go back, back inside.

491
01:00:42,257 --> 01:00:46,386
- I Got you!
- He got me...

492
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:50,515
My boot!

493
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:08,239
- Phillipe, it's me they're after!
- Don't flatter yourself.

494
01:01:44,314 --> 01:01:45,398
Hold me!

495
01:01:46,566 --> 01:01:47,984
I'm slipping!

496
01:01:49,652 --> 01:01:50,528
No!!!

497
01:02:42,117 --> 01:02:43,118
You!

498
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,620
- Where is the woman?
- She flew away!

499
01:02:45,704 --> 01:02:48,206
- Where is she?!
- God's truth, she flew away!

500
01:03:09,392 --> 01:03:11,519
It always pays to say the truth, my Lord.

501
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:14,522
Thank you. I see that now.

502
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,203
I thought you might have
been dead, old man.

503
01:03:30,203 --> 01:03:32,413
There were times I wanted
to kill you myself.

504
01:03:33,456 --> 01:03:37,251
But I'm very grateful... for this.

505
01:03:40,087 --> 01:03:44,000
It is I who should be grateful
to have the chance ...

506
01:03:44,005 --> 01:03:48,595
to redeem myself, and to
save you and Isabeau.

507
01:03:48,678 --> 01:03:53,391
Because the Lord has told me,
how the curse may be broken.

508
01:03:56,810 --> 01:04:00,063
You have betrayed us
once, I warn you.

509
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:05,986
3 days hence, the Bishop will hear
confessions from the clergy...

510
01:04:06,236 --> 01:04:08,404
in the cathedral in Aquila.

511
01:04:08,613 --> 01:04:13,409
All you have to do is to confront him,
both of you, as man and woman...

512
01:04:13,618 --> 01:04:15,327
in the flesh...

513
01:04:15,327 --> 01:04:18,330
and the curse will be confounded...

514
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:22,000
broken. And both of
you will be free!

515
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:27,756
- Impossible.
- As long as there is night and day, no.

516
01:04:27,756 --> 01:04:33,386
But 3 days hence, in Aquila,
there will be a day without a night...

517
01:04:33,386 --> 01:04:35,054
and a night without a day.

518
01:04:37,389 --> 01:04:40,434
Go back inside, old man,
go back to your drink.

519
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,853
You think that I'm drunk?!

520
01:04:43,937 --> 01:04:45,188
I swear to you!

521
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:47,732
God has shown me!

522
01:04:48,608 --> 01:04:50,443
He has forgiven me!

523
01:04:51,611 --> 01:04:53,404
He hasn't forgiven you.

524
01:04:55,656 --> 01:04:56,991
He's made you mad.

525
01:05:03,288 --> 01:05:04,623
Sir, sir!

526
01:05:13,631 --> 01:05:15,216
It's all right, Father.

527
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Sir...

528
01:05:18,555 --> 01:05:19,555
Sir.

529
01:05:22,556 --> 01:05:24,391
How's your shoulder?

530
01:05:26,976 --> 01:05:30,021
- I'm in your debt.
- Me? Sir, no, no, not at all.

531
01:05:31,606 --> 01:05:34,108
She wanted me to
deliver a message....

532
01:05:34,275 --> 01:05:36,986
to say, that she still has
hope, faith in you..

533
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:43,950
- You're free to go.
- I know that, sir.

534
01:05:44,284 --> 01:05:46,202
- Do as you like.
- Yes, sir

535
01:05:47,745 --> 01:05:50,540
And you and Ladyhawke will be
going on to Aquila?

536
01:05:50,544 --> 01:05:51,961
Ladyhawke?

537
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,500
Yes.

538
01:05:56,964 --> 01:06:03,659
Well, it just so happens, I'm heading
in that general direction myself.

539
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,578
Really?

540
01:06:10,207 --> 01:06:12,960
Then you better grab your
things, I'm leaving now.

541
01:06:13,419 --> 01:06:14,378
Right.

542
01:06:19,591 --> 01:06:20,842
Ladyhawke.

543
01:06:23,928 --> 01:06:27,140
Imperious, I'm leaving with
the Captain, follow us.

544
01:06:37,149 --> 01:06:40,026
But if the old man is right
about breaking the curse...

545
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:44,572
if you and Isabeau could face the
Bishop together as man and woman...

546
01:06:44,781 --> 01:06:49,577
You will not mention this again.
Not to me, not to her!

547
01:06:49,577 --> 01:06:50,953
Understood?

548
01:06:54,373 --> 01:06:56,792
Abraham, will you get a move on?

549
01:06:59,586 --> 01:07:03,131
It looks like a big one, Captain.
We're gonna get soaked.

550
01:07:05,174 --> 01:07:06,509
Find shelter.

551
01:07:09,345 --> 01:07:11,764
- The sun is going down.
- How can you tell?

552
01:07:12,973 --> 01:07:14,308
After so many sunsets?

553
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:18,145
Take care of Ladyhawke.

554
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:28,571
Tell her I love her.

555
01:07:44,669 --> 01:07:45,962
Are you hungry?

556
01:07:49,715 --> 01:07:51,258
Do you understand me, Ladyhawke?

557
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,849
You're my favorite thing
for dinner, hawk.

558
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:01,351
I've eaten thousands of them.
I used to kill one every night.

559
01:08:06,022 --> 01:08:08,983
Serves me right for getting
involved in this nightmare.

560
01:08:09,275 --> 01:08:11,610
Nightmare? Daymare...

561
01:08:12,486 --> 01:08:16,281
And then "a night without day,
a day without night..."

562
01:08:16,949 --> 01:08:18,408
What's that supposed to mean?

563
01:08:19,534 --> 01:08:22,037
Makes about as much sense
as the rest of it.

564
01:08:24,164 --> 01:08:25,581
Sun sets.

565
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,918
I'll wait outside.

566
01:08:36,967 --> 01:08:38,385
Hold on for a minute.

567
01:09:09,914 --> 01:09:11,582
I can't vouch for the fit.

568
01:09:15,002 --> 01:09:16,962
Take you time, my lady.

569
01:10:00,252 --> 01:10:01,253
Miss?

570
01:10:04,672 --> 01:10:05,965
My lady?

571
01:10:06,799 --> 01:10:08,426
I'm coming in!

572
01:10:11,262 --> 01:10:12,179
Miss?

573
01:10:17,225 --> 01:10:18,185
Miss?

574
01:10:22,731 --> 01:10:24,566
It's me, remember?

575
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,529
- You?
- Yeah.

576
01:10:32,156 --> 01:10:33,157
Thank you.

577
01:10:37,661 --> 01:10:39,996
- How is he?
- He's alive, like you.

578
01:10:41,456 --> 01:10:43,458
He's full of hope, like you.

579
01:10:44,042 --> 01:10:45,918
He left you in my charge.

580
01:10:47,628 --> 01:10:52,967
He said, "tell her that we speak as one, and
she will follow your instructions as my own".

581
01:10:54,176 --> 01:10:55,219
Really?

582
01:10:56,553 --> 01:10:57,721
No, don't swear.

583
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:04,310
Good evening, Goliath.

584
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:12,109
He's taking us back
to Aquila, isn't he?

585
01:11:17,948 --> 01:11:20,158
Well, what do you instruct?

586
01:11:22,952 --> 01:11:25,955
I instruct you to sit
by a warm fire...

587
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:28,749
to drink a cup of sweet wine...

588
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:33,128
and to listen to bright
music cheerfully played.

589
01:11:33,921 --> 01:11:35,172
Perhaps even dance.

590
01:11:40,885 --> 01:11:43,012
Shall we, my lady? Dance?

591
01:11:45,348 --> 01:11:47,308
- Now?
- Practice.

592
01:12:21,047 --> 01:12:23,007
It has been a long time, Phillipe.

593
01:12:24,175 --> 01:12:26,344
I'll have my cup of
sweet wine now.

594
01:12:27,011 --> 01:12:27,929
All right.

595
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:41,941
So, you intend to by my protector
as well, eh? I'm flattered.

596
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:45,653
Actually, the truth is,
he'll kill me if I lose it.

597
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,285
I had to steel your dress.

598
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:56,705
You stole my dress?

599
01:13:04,128 --> 01:13:06,714
Isabeau. Isabeau!

600
01:13:07,757 --> 01:13:09,133
Isabeau? Isabeau...

601
01:13:10,342 --> 01:13:11,802
- Get inside!
- No!

602
01:13:14,972 --> 01:13:18,767
If you lay one hand on her, you will
find it on the ground next to your head!

603
01:13:18,934 --> 01:13:22,520
- Now, ride on!
- Easy, little man, you're frightening me.

604
01:13:22,645 --> 01:13:24,731
Are you deaf? Ride on!

605
01:13:31,362 --> 01:13:33,113
Turn around, and you're dead!

606
01:13:40,211 --> 01:13:42,005
What a terrible night.

607
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:48,336
Isabeau...

608
01:13:49,553 --> 01:13:50,553
Isabeau...

609
01:13:51,055 --> 01:13:52,055
Isabeau!

610
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:54,255
Isabeau!

611
01:14:03,933 --> 01:14:05,393
He'll kill me.

612
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,400
He'll kill me!

613
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:38,770
Show yourself, coward!

614
01:15:56,245 --> 01:15:57,454
My beautiful.

615
01:16:06,873 --> 01:16:07,873
Navarre...

616
01:16:10,174 --> 01:16:11,759
A black wolf...

617
01:16:43,455 --> 01:16:45,748
Will you get on, Abraham?

618
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:49,794
Go faster, it's going
to snow soon.

619
01:17:25,994 --> 01:17:27,203
Good morning.

620
01:17:28,372 --> 01:17:30,374
Oh... Good morning

621
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:33,000
You look a little pale,
I got you something to eat.

622
01:17:34,043 --> 01:17:35,169
What a night...

623
01:17:37,713 --> 01:17:38,964
What happened?

624
01:17:40,215 --> 01:17:42,842
Ah... Oh, nothing I couldn't handle,
Captain.

625
01:18:00,817 --> 01:18:03,862
It's a good little hawk, nice bird.

626
01:18:05,488 --> 01:18:07,448
Go on now, go to your master.

627
01:18:08,449 --> 01:18:10,576
- Go on, Ladyhawke.
- Last night...

628
01:18:10,993 --> 01:18:12,036
Captain?

629
01:18:12,036 --> 01:18:14,163
- Tell me about it.
- What's to tell?

630
01:18:14,329 --> 01:18:15,747
Go on now, go on, go...

631
01:18:16,123 --> 01:18:20,568
- We ran in a bit of trouble on the way to an inn.
- You took Isabeau to an inn?!

632
01:18:21,378 --> 01:18:24,731
First we had to go to a stable.
Fly to your master, fly to the one you love.

633
01:18:24,839 --> 01:18:27,216
- What did you do in a stable?
- We changed clothes.

634
01:18:27,383 --> 01:18:28,426
What!?

635
01:18:28,426 --> 01:18:30,594
- Not together, of course!
- Did you leave her alone?!

636
01:18:30,803 --> 01:18:32,763
- No!
- So you did change together!..

637
01:18:32,763 --> 01:18:34,348
No, no, no! Take her, take her.

638
01:18:45,817 --> 01:18:48,486
She is the most wonderful
woman that ever lived...

639
01:18:49,403 --> 01:18:52,139
and I can't say I haven't
had my fantasies

640
01:18:52,531 --> 01:18:55,583
but the truth is, all she
did was talk about you.

641
01:19:03,374 --> 01:19:06,335
Every moment you spend with her...

642
01:19:06,544 --> 01:19:08,129
I envy you..

643
01:19:17,638 --> 01:19:19,514
But you can tell me.

644
01:19:20,473 --> 01:19:22,600
Tell me everything she said.

645
01:19:24,561 --> 01:19:28,940
And I warn you, I will know
if the words are hers.

646
01:19:43,953 --> 01:19:45,538
She was sad at first.

647
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:50,709
She talked about the day you
met, and she cursed it.

648
01:19:55,923 --> 01:19:57,674
But then I saw her...

649
01:19:57,966 --> 01:20:01,177
remember how happy you were together...

650
01:20:01,177 --> 01:20:03,179
before the Bishop's curse.

651
01:20:04,097 --> 01:20:05,890
And her eyes glowed.

652
01:20:07,517 --> 01:20:09,310
No, she glowed.

653
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:14,064
She loves you more than life,
Captain. She's had to.

654
01:20:17,484 --> 01:20:21,237
Did you know that hawks and
wolves mate for life?

655
01:20:25,533 --> 01:20:27,952
Yeah... The Bishop didn't
even leave us that.

656
01:20:28,828 --> 01:20:30,496
Not even that.

657
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:12,384
On your way to kill His Grace?

658
01:21:12,384 --> 01:21:14,177
Why won't you listen to me?

659
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:16,805
In 2 days time...

660
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:20,808
you can face the Bishop in the
cathedral with Isabeau by your side...

661
01:21:20,975 --> 01:21:22,977
and break the curse.

662
01:21:23,394 --> 01:21:26,021
I will be in Aquila tomorrow.

663
01:21:26,021 --> 01:21:30,400
And in one way or another,
there will finally be an end to it.

664
01:21:30,984 --> 01:21:34,154
One day more or less,
what can it matter?

665
01:21:34,487 --> 01:21:35,280
You too?

666
01:21:36,781 --> 01:21:37,949
I warned you.

667
01:21:38,658 --> 01:21:42,411
- Stay here then with the old man.
- No, I'm going with you.

668
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:45,080
How can you get inside
the cathedral without me?

669
01:21:45,247 --> 01:21:47,416
I will get in without your help.

670
01:21:58,843 --> 01:22:03,597
Thank you for trying, Phillipe,
and for standing up for the truth.

671
01:22:04,849 --> 01:22:06,642
I should have known better.

672
01:22:07,226 --> 01:22:10,937
Every happy moment in my
life has come from lying.

673
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:59,023
There you are, little Mouse.

674
01:23:00,191 --> 01:23:02,151
Where is my knife?

675
01:23:03,027 --> 01:23:06,238
- Isabeau?
- I just had it, now what have I done with it?

676
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:09,366
Isabeau, this may be
our last evening together.

677
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,916
- Why?
- I didn't want to tell you until I believed.

678
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:19,584
I mean, really believed.

679
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:25,214
- Really believed what, Phillipe?
- I think we can break the curse.

680
01:23:29,468 --> 01:23:30,761
We have a plan.

681
01:23:35,056 --> 01:23:37,225
- You and Navarre?
- No.

682
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:50,737
Must you keep punching
me in the liver?!

683
01:23:55,825 --> 01:23:57,327
Imperious...

684
01:23:57,702 --> 01:24:00,746
this hole isn't big enough
for the two of us.

685
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,374
Well, let's hope it's
big enough for the wolf.

686
01:24:22,642 --> 01:24:24,143
Ah! What are you doing?!

687
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:29,982
When you kneel before the altar,
how do you get up again?

688
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,983
You sacrilegious young imp!

689
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:38,635
you... Push, blast yah!
Come on, again! And again!

690
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,454
He's coming, he's coming!

691
01:24:48,749 --> 01:24:49,749
Phillipe!

692
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:51,793
My lady, my lady! We are
just covering the trap.

693
01:24:52,461 --> 01:24:53,920
All right, hurry!

694
01:25:15,774 --> 01:25:17,275
He's coming across the ice.

695
01:25:27,493 --> 01:25:29,745
- Wait, my lady!
- Phillipe, help me!

696
01:25:34,332 --> 01:25:36,543
The ice will break,
lie down, lie down!

697
01:25:38,628 --> 01:25:40,296
He can't get out!

698
01:25:50,222 --> 01:25:51,223
Wait!

699
01:25:52,557 --> 01:25:54,100
Wait, my lady!

700
01:25:55,769 --> 01:25:58,104
Oh, God, Phillipe, I can't...

701
01:25:59,105 --> 01:26:00,648
I'm coming.

702
01:26:03,984 --> 01:26:05,528
Hurry, we'll lose him!

703
01:26:09,406 --> 01:26:10,824
He's heavy.

704
01:26:13,785 --> 01:26:15,912
He's slipping.

705
01:26:20,374 --> 01:26:21,374
Hold him.

706
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:24,100
Be careful!

707
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,500
Isabeau...

708
01:26:29,501 --> 01:26:31,001
Hurry up!

709
01:26:36,973 --> 01:26:38,016
Phillipe!

710
01:26:46,023 --> 01:26:49,443
Push, push, push!

711
01:26:52,487 --> 01:26:54,572
It's all right.

712
01:27:02,872 --> 01:27:03,831
Hold on!

713
01:27:04,915 --> 01:27:06,458
Hold on, boy!

714
01:27:31,898 --> 01:27:33,525
We must live, Father.

715
01:27:35,318 --> 01:27:36,736
As human beings.

716
01:27:39,572 --> 01:27:41,657
Our lives are in your hands now.

717
01:31:37,707 --> 01:31:41,294
Tell me one thing. Where is
my father's sword?

718
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:42,503
It's gone.

719
01:31:42,878 --> 01:31:45,673
It fell through the ice last
night, crossing the river.

720
01:31:45,673 --> 01:31:46,799
Damn you!

721
01:31:46,924 --> 01:31:51,494
- That sword was the last bit of honor I possessed!
- There is no mission of honor now.

722
01:31:52,262 --> 01:31:56,999
The jewel you wished to place in your sword has
become a symbol of your meaningless death!

723
01:31:58,059 --> 01:32:02,104
But there is a chance for life now.
A new life with her!

724
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:06,900
- I needed that sword to kill the Bishop!
- Navarre, listen to him!

725
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:08,652
- Damn you!
- Go ahead!

726
01:32:08,652 --> 01:32:12,822
Kill yourself, kill her too! You never cared
about her as much as yourself anyway!

727
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:25,084
What is that?

728
01:32:25,668 --> 01:32:28,670
It happened last night,
when he saved your life!

729
01:32:36,177 --> 01:32:37,345
Forgive me.

730
01:32:49,523 --> 01:32:53,026
I'll show you idiots
how to cage a wolf.

731
01:33:11,501 --> 01:33:15,088
Remember, the groove
inside the north wall.

732
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,500
<i>Open the gate.</i>

733
01:33:29,935 --> 01:33:32,437
We have come a full circle, Lord.

734
01:33:34,022 --> 01:33:37,150
I would like to think there is some
higher meaning in all of this.

735
01:33:38,151 --> 01:33:40,361
It certainly would reflect well on you.

736
01:33:46,867 --> 01:33:48,952
Go on here, come on...

737
01:33:52,122 --> 01:33:53,122
Hold! 

738
01:33:53,623 --> 01:33:56,025
What have we here, Holy Father?

739
01:33:56,042 --> 01:33:59,990
A surprise present, eh... my son,...

740
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,039
for His Grace the Bishop, from...

741
01:34:02,289 --> 01:34:04,175
From the people of my parish.

742
01:34:07,386 --> 01:34:09,346
A fine pelt for his wall.

743
01:34:12,516 --> 01:34:13,975
And what have we here?

744
01:34:21,732 --> 01:34:24,276
I've never had the pleasure
of killing a wolf before.

745
01:34:25,861 --> 01:34:28,864
How strange, it's exactly
what the Bishop said.

746
01:34:30,198 --> 01:34:33,785
I'm sure he will understand you
depriving him of that pleasure.

747
01:34:33,785 --> 01:34:35,787
he's a very forgiving sort of man.

748
01:34:41,834 --> 01:34:43,419
Very well, pass on.

749
01:34:45,045 --> 01:34:49,007
Wisdom is beyond price, my son.
Be grateful that you have it.

750
01:34:57,039 --> 01:34:58,224
Clear the post!

751
01:35:38,513 --> 01:35:39,513
Your Grace.

752
01:35:36,514 --> 01:35:37,714
And I am ready.

753
01:36:27,914 --> 01:36:31,251
It should be soon now,
once the clouds break.

754
01:36:32,544 --> 01:36:34,253
It's day, old man.

755
01:36:34,504 --> 01:36:37,506
Like it was yesterday, like
it will be tomorrow.

756
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:26,100
Oh, no... 

757
01:37:36,811 --> 01:37:37,561
Damn.

758
01:38:04,336 --> 01:38:06,630
- What's the matter?
- Rats!

759
01:38:06,797 --> 01:38:09,257
Rats?! Here?!

760
01:38:11,676 --> 01:38:13,094
Scandalous.

761
01:38:53,756 --> 01:38:55,425
There's no time left.

762
01:38:55,425 --> 01:38:59,261
The mass will be over soon.
I cannot wait for you now.

763
01:38:59,595 --> 01:39:03,599
If Phillipe has done his job, I can
kill the Bishop now or never.

764
01:39:03,599 --> 01:39:07,018
No, Etienne, this chance
will never come again!

765
01:39:08,019 --> 01:39:09,104
You're right.

766
01:39:10,563 --> 01:39:14,025
If the service ends peacefully...

767
01:39:14,025 --> 01:39:17,153
the cathedral bells begin to toll...

768
01:39:17,153 --> 01:39:19,405
and you will know I have failed.

769
01:39:22,616 --> 01:39:24,326
But Isabeau...

770
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:30,200
I...

771
01:39:34,836 --> 01:39:37,171
beg you take her life...

772
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:42,217
quick and painless.

773
01:39:42,468 --> 01:39:43,969
I can't do that!

774
01:39:44,261 --> 01:39:47,013
Yes you can! I beg you.

775
01:39:47,013 --> 01:39:51,142
The cruelty would be to damn her to a half-life
like this, that is not what she wants.

776
01:39:53,394 --> 01:39:55,396
I couldn't do it.

777
01:39:56,981 --> 01:40:00,985
Have you ever considered that
this is what God intended all along?

778
01:40:41,647 --> 01:40:44,274
As the one who was once your Captain...

779
01:40:44,316 --> 01:40:49,404
and through God's grace will be
once again, I ask you to let me pass.

780
01:40:51,573 --> 01:40:53,366
Captain Navarre...

781
01:40:53,366 --> 01:40:54,492
I have my orders...

782
01:41:09,381 --> 01:41:11,132
Come on, open! Damn it!
Open!

783
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:20,590
Come on...

784
01:41:22,784 --> 01:41:24,593
Come on. Come on!

785
01:42:26,092 --> 01:42:28,011
Navarre!

786
01:43:36,031 --> 01:43:37,366
Oh, thank you, Lord.

787
01:45:09,617 --> 01:45:11,869
A night without a day...

788
01:45:14,038 --> 01:45:16,081
and a day without a night...

789
01:45:27,008 --> 01:45:30,970
Dear Lord, go with him, be with him.

790
01:45:37,267 --> 01:45:39,853
Imperious, wait!

791
01:45:40,054 --> 01:45:41,254
Stop!

792
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:01,957
You're dead.

793
01:46:46,331 --> 01:46:47,707
Stop!

794
01:46:59,661 --> 01:47:00,861
Imperious...

795
01:47:02,762 --> 01:47:03,888
make it quick.

796
01:47:05,849 --> 01:47:07,433
God, forgive me.

797
01:49:40,991 --> 01:49:42,576
But kill me, Navarre...

798
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:46,162
and the curse will go on forever.

799
01:49:47,246 --> 01:49:48,873
You must think of Isabeau.

800
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,253
Isabeau...

801
01:49:55,337 --> 01:49:56,505
is dead.

802
01:49:59,966 --> 01:50:01,426
Damn you.

803
01:50:03,887 --> 01:50:06,931
- Damn you to hell.
- Navarre?

804
01:50:40,629 --> 01:50:42,047
Look!

805
01:50:43,298 --> 01:50:44,841
Look at her!

806
01:50:55,017 --> 01:50:56,643
Look at me.

807
01:51:21,958 --> 01:51:23,084
Now, look at us.

808
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:29,465
Look at us!

809
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:37,347
It's over. It's broken.

810
01:53:33,746 --> 01:53:35,372
No man shall!..

811
01:53:36,623 --> 01:53:37,457
Navarre!

812
01:54:47,438 --> 01:54:49,607
Oh, my God!

813
01:55:02,410 --> 01:55:04,370
Isabeau...

814
01:55:07,832 --> 01:55:09,250
You've cut your hair.

815
01:55:11,502 --> 01:55:12,711
I love you...

816
01:55:14,046 --> 01:55:16,632
- Isabeau.
- Navarre.

817
01:55:30,269 --> 01:55:31,437
You two!

818
01:55:34,398 --> 01:55:35,482
Come here.

819
01:55:48,411 --> 01:55:49,996
May God's blessings...

820
01:55:51,038 --> 01:55:54,875
be with you both, from
this day forward.

821
01:55:54,875 --> 01:55:58,712
I bless the day he brought
you back to us, father.

822
01:55:58,712 --> 01:56:01,423
And you. And you...

823
01:56:07,053 --> 01:56:10,264
You're the truest friend
we could ever have.

824
01:56:14,852 --> 01:56:16,437
Thank you.

825
01:56:26,988 --> 01:56:32,451
I fully intend to meet you at the pearly gates,
little thief. Don't you dare disappoint me!

826
01:56:33,202 --> 01:56:36,872
I'll meet you there, father.
Even if I'd have to pick the lock.

827
01:56:42,372 --> 01:56:43,572
Isabeau!

828
01:56:55,624 --> 01:56:58,204
I love you! I love you!
