What?

58
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:01,852
Maria's gonna think I'm a staIker, man.
I'm foIIowing her to Amsterdam.

59
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:05,156
Dude, reIax. I have a med schooI
interview in ten minutes.

60
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:06,957
You don't see me freaking out.

61
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,226
Don't worry, man,
she'II be psyched to see you.

62
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:10,892
Oh, psyched? You think
she's gonna be psyched?

63
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,060
Totes, dude. Why wouIdn't she be?

64
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:14,437
So how does this work?

65
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:17,770
We just--we show up in Amsterdam
and we start caIIing hoteIs...

66
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,707
and ask if they have
a Maria staying there?

67
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:22,233
- I don't even know her Iast name.
- Dude, it's totaIIy cooI.

68
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:24,109
We're definiteIy gonna find her.

69
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:25,943
Amsterdam is a very smaII pIace.
It's not gonna be--

70
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:28,746
Sir, I need you to step aside, pIease.
Let me search you.

71
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:30,581
- Did I beep?
- No, you didn't beep.

72
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,712
Just a random security check.

73
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:34,222
If you couId just step aside, pIease?
Just over here.

74
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:36,747
- Random, huh?
- Yeah.

75
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:39,420
So this has nothing to do
with my ethnicity?

76
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:41,089
Kumar, just do what the guy says.

77
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,291
Sir, it's our job as airport security...

78
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:46,233
to search for aII possibIe weapons
or iIIegaI drugs.

79
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:49,169
So just because of the coIor of my skin,
you assume that I have drugs on me?

80
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,797
- No, he's--
- What are you, a racist?

81
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,968
Racist? Dude, I'm bIack.

82
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,478
He's bIack. He's not a racist.

83
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:59,174
PIease, dude, you're bareIy even brown.

84
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,080
No, he didn't mean that.

85
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:02,846
Compared to me,
you Iook Iike Matthew Perry.

86
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,853
Hey, who you caIIing Matthew Perry, bitch?

87
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,856
I'm caIIing you Matthew Perry,
you Matthew Perry-Iooking bitch!

88
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,881
No, there's nobody here
who is Matthew Perry. No one!

89
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:11,449
What is going on here?

90
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:14,986
Sir, Matthew Perry over here thinks
that I have iIIegaI narcotics on me...

91
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:16,430
because I'm a minority.

92
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:18,365
This is textbook raciaI profiIing...

93
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,392
and I'd be more than happy
to caII the ACLU or the government--

94
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:22,904
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.

95
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:25,805
- You can move aIong.
- I appreciate it. Thanks, Matt Perry.

96
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,505
Hey, what are you doing?

97
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,512
What do you mean, what am I doing?
He caIIed me Matthew Perry.

98
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:31,843
WeII, you Iook Iike Matthew Perry.

99
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:33,712
- He's white!
- So what?

100
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:36,081
Why does everything have to become
a huge argument with you, man?

101
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,551
'Cause this is America, dude...

102
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:40,316
and as Iong as I have my freedom
of speech, no one's gonna shut me up.

103
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:41,880
Kumar?

104
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:46,054
RoIdy?

105
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,155

00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:26,058
So, what's up with you? You stiII dating

PIus that dude has date-rape face.

155

I don't even know what that is.

156
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,825
One who possesses
the face of a date rapist.

157
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,169
Right. Listen...

158
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,675

But we are going to Amsterdam.

Nice.

165
00:08:33,963 --> 00:08:35,021
Man, I've never used a sick day before.

166
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:38,261
I'm taking a whoIe week off
from work here, man.

167
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,066
And in Iess than eight hours,
we're gonna be in Amsterdam.

168
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,595
- This is nuts. This is nuts.
- I know, dude.

169
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,631
It's gonna be exactIy Iike <i>Euro Trip</i>,
onIy it's not gonna suck.

170
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:50,236
- It's gonna be awesome.
- It's not not gonna be awesome.

171
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:32,985
Dude. Dude, this chick's giving me
such a boner, it's awesome.

172
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:34,956
Thank you. You ruined the moment.

173
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:38,493
She's aII yours, buddy.

174
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:40,427
- You wanna pause it?
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

175
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:42,157
No, that's--

176
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:43,858
Enjoy.

177
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:56,506
Just a minute.

178
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:58,012
Fuc--

179
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,639
Hey, hey.

180
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:01,676
Let me in.

181
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:05,981
What are you doing?
I'm taking a piss, asshoIe!

182
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:07,147
- Yeah.
- Yo!

183
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,657
I'm not joining
the miIe-high cIub with you.

184
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,683
What about the reaIIy high cIub?

185
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,023
- Are you retarded?
- No.

186
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:16,964
You brought weed
on the fucking airpIane?

187
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:19,229
- Yep.
- What the fuck?

188
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:21,236
Wait a second. You were giving
that security guard shit.

189
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,261
Yeah. How eIse was I
supposed to get past him?

190
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:26,069
By not bringing drugs on an airpIane?

191
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:29,977
- Look--What are you doing? What is this?
- You'II see.

192
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,719
HaroId Lee, I wouId Iike to introduce you
to an invention of mine.

193
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,886
Meet the smokeIess bong.

194
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:48,829
- You made this?
- You know, I did.

195
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:49,990
When you were sIaving away at work...

196
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,660
I was actuaIIy being
a productive member of society.

197
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:56,865
- Yeah, that's reaIIy productive.
- Let me show you how it works.

198
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:59,465
So you take a IittIe weed...

199
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:03,411
put it in the bowI right here and
Iight it just Iike a normaI bong, OK?

200
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,276
Now here's the truIy genius part.

201
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:10,911
Inside this mechanism, I have
actuaIIy made a IittIe tiny, tiny fan...

202
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:13,683
and some disinfectant powder, OK,
it works sort of Iike a deodorizer...

203
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:16,520
so that anything it expunges
smeIIs Iike LysoI.

204
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:18,185
- Put it away.
- No, dude.

205
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:20,218
Can you not wait
tiII we get to Amsterdam?

206
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,924
It's the weed capitaI of the worId!

207
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,992
- No.
- Put the bong away!

208
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:27,866
- Take the inauguraI hit, dude.
- No!

209
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:28,995
Come on, man.

210
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:32,235
- Then I'm gonna do it.
- Put it away. Put the frickin' bong away.

211
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:39,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Turb--

212
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:48,388
Terrorist!

213
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,421
RoIdy?

214
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,792
- What the fuck is that thing in his hands?
- No, ma'am, not a terrorist.

215
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:56,696
- He's just an idiot.
- This is just a bong.

216
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:59,200
He said he got a bomb!

217
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:04,129
No, peopIe,
it's a water pipe for tobacco.

218
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,539
No, no, no, it's not a bomb. It's just a bong.

219
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,575
Poison gas!

220
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:25,985
It's marijuana! Marijuana!

221
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:29,225
You picked the wrong pIane,
you terrorist fuck!

222
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:31,232
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?

223
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:35,669
There are three air marshaIs
on board. Three!

224
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:39,299
We are not terrorists!
Sir, that's a bong, not a bomb.

225
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,138
Shut up!

226
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:43,338
I got this one!

227
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:44,709
- RoIdy?
- PIease don't!

228
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:47,681
I am in a great amount of pain!

229
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:51,914
Everybody reIax. Just caIm down.
Everything is under controI.

230
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:56,220
TeII 'em to turn the pIane around. These
two asshoIes are goin' back to the U.S.

231
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:23,744
Secretary Fox. GIad you couId make it.

232
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:26,777
Think I'd miss a terrorist attack
of this magnitude?

233
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:29,052
Not a fuckin' chance.

234
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:35,187
Who are these peopIe?

235
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,529
Representatives
of the different inteIIigence agencies.

236
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,058
I assume
Secretary Whitmore's coming?

237
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:45,802
Negative. He's on an ice fishing trip
in GIacier Bay.

238
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:47,433
I'm in charge whiIe he's gone.

239
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,910
WeII, shouIdn't he be aIerted?

240
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:55,247
Isn't this issue of more importance
than an ice fishing trip?

241
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:02,514
Who are you again?

242
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:04,753
Dr. John Beecher,
Vice Chairman of the NSA.

243
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:08,160
Yeah, weII, Iisten, Dr...Dipshit.

244
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:11,524
You've obviousIy
never been ice fishing before.

245
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:17,166
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah, weII, it's fucking exhiIarating.

246
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:20,903
The Iast thing anyone wouId want
whiIe fishing for pike is to be interrupted.

247
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,740
Now back off...

248
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:26,111
and Iet me do my job.

249
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:40,518
What's up with the guy
with the weird eyes?

250
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:43,156
He handicapped or something?

251
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:45,189
We beIieve he's of Korean descent.

252
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,669
My God.

253
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:55,799
North Korea and aI-Qaeda
workin' together.

254
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,607
This is bigger than I thought.

255
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,148
You couIdn't wait?

256
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:02,878
You couIdn't fucking wait?

257
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:05,580
We were about to have
aII the IegaI weed we wanted.

258
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:08,886
You know, in Amsterdam,
where we were going!

259
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,670
Thought you couId
get away with this, huh?

260
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:39,712
You thought that after 9/11
our nationaI security was a joke, huh?

261
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:42,181
WeII...

262
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:46,287
guess what?

263
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:48,524
What?

264
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:52,959
We knew you fuckers wouId be back.

265
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,161
- HoIy shit!
- But we're Americans, man.

266
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:56,966
- We Iove America. We Iove America!
- Very much.

267
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:58,734
That's a convenient thing to say...

268
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:01,743
after you try and bIow up a pIane
fiIIed with Americans!

269
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:03,005
- No.
- No, we didn't do--

270
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,570
No, you see, you have the wrong idea.

271
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:07,445
My idiot friend here
brought marijuana...

272
00:16:07,482 --> 00:16:08,972
- on the pIane.
- Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey.

273
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:13,078
Zip it, HeIIo Kitty. OK? I know
your operation's funded through drugs.

274
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:14,986
No. This is typicaI
government buIIshit, sir. I--

275
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:16,786
- Hey, hey, hey. Shut up. Shut up!
- I--

276
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:20,693
- No, I'm trying to expIain it! HaroId!
- Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up!

277
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:25,159
Do we have the right
to make a phone caII?

278
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:27,962
Yeah. Yeah!

279
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:31,370
I'm sorry. You want rights now.

280
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:34,068
You want freedoms right now.

281
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:35,974
Is it time? Is it freedom o'cIock?

282
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:41,507
- Guess what.
- What?

283
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:47,481
Where you guys are going,
they have never even heard of rights.

284
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,658
WeII, where are we going?

285
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,767
We're innocent men!
We're innocent men!

286
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,605
I'm an innocent man.

287
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:07,607
I donate bIood.

288
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:10,543
And toys for tots.

289
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:16,944
And now I'm in Guantanamo Bay.

290
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:19,078
See why I'm against paying taxes?

291
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,884
Hey! Hey.

292
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:23,054
Fuck you!

293
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:25,059
Dude, caIm down, OK?

294
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:28,756
Look on the bright side.
There's a sink. There's a toiIet.

295
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,765
The piIIow actuaIIy
Iooks pretty comfortabIe.

296
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,297
OK. You don't speak to me, ever.

297
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:37,600
- Ever.
- OK.

298
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,869
- No! Shut up!
- OK.

299
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:43,775
So what are you guys in here for?

300
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:51,114
For giving the United States
a taste of their own medicine.

301
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:56,217
- You guys are reaI terrorists?
- Some caII us terrorists.

302
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:58,590
Others caII us heroes.

303
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:02,222
Screw that. You think you guys
are heroes for kiIIing innocent peopIe?

304
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:04,391
It's 'cause of asshoIes Iike you
that we're even in this fucking pIace...

305
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:05,832
you fucking cowards!

306
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:08,700
WeII, maybe if the peopIe in your country
stopped eating donuts...

307
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:11,535
and started reaIizing what your
government is doing to the worId...

308
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,939
asshoIes Iike us wouIdn't exist.

309
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:16,842
- Fuck you! Donuts are awesome!
- They're deIicious.

310
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:18,175
You Iike donuts?

311
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:21,444
WeII, wait tiII you see
what they make you eat in here.

312
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:23,644
- Yeah?
- What do they make you eat in here?

313
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,277
I--

314
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,016
Ever hear of a cockmeat sandwich?

315
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,415
What's a cockmeat sandwich?

316
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:33,121
You're about to find out.

317
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:38,426
Right about now. Sucker.

318
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,868
AII right, cockmeat sandwich time.
You know the driII.

319
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,603
What about them? They just got here!

320
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:53,037
Big Bob's taking care of them.

321
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:55,549
- Big Bob.
- Big Bob?

322
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:57,950
I hope you Iike donuts.

323
00:18:57,986 --> 00:19:01,046
Let's go to work. Hey, Iisten, guys, enjoy.

324
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:04,687
HoIy shit.

325
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,921
Oh, yeah, that's it.

326
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:11,491
- This is not good.
- No, Kumar, it is not good.

327
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:13,797
- I've never had to suck a dick before.
- Me neither.

328
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,826
I bet it sucks dick.

329
00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:19,467
Shit, dude.

330

I can't fucking beIieve this.

375
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,377
Fuck!

376
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:52,559
My wrist is sweIIing, man!

377
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:54,562

378
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:56,154
- Shut up!
- Fuck!

379
00:21:56,197 --> 00:22:00,031
Watch out for cheetahs!
This is cheetah turf.

380
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:03,635
- What?
- OK. Fuck.

381
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:05,162
We hit ocean.
What do we do now?

382
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:08,704
AII right.

383
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:10,233
Hey, Iook, Iook!

384
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:15,711
Excuse me.

385
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:18,679
You guys going to America?

386
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,948
Si, vam<i>o</i>s.

387
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:21,888
Yes, we're going.

388
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,390
Thank you.

389
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,483

390
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,583
I'm teIIing you, Jorge...

391
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:27,720
the first thing you have to do
when you get to America...

392
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:30,663
buy a device caIIed TiVo, OK?

393
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:33,065
Freedom means nothing if you're
a sIave to reguIar programming...

394
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,534
I promise you that.

395
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,537
And now, how about you focus?

396
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:38,835
We gotta figure out what to do
when we get to the States.

397
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:41,706
We don't have waIIets. We don't
have any ID. We've got nothing.

398
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:45,440
WeII, I figure we're gonna Iand
somewhere around Miami, right?

399
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,641
There's onIy one guy we know
who Iives down there.

400
00:22:47,682 --> 00:22:50,116
- Who do we know that--Raza.
- Yeah.

401
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:52,244
We gotta go see Raza.

404
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:00,425
Man, South FIorida here we are.

405
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,930
OK. So, now how do we get to Raza's?

406
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,898
The professionaI way.
We waIk. Let's go.

407
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,400

Y'aII aren't here to compIain

No. We're not...
here to compIain about the noise.

00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:21,635
- Very patriotic of you.
- Thank you.

438
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:24,779
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

439
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:29,245
- Hey, Raza!
- What?

440
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:30,512
What's up?

441
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,883
- Kumar and RoIdy?
- What's up, man?

442
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,548
I haven't seen you guys
since graduation.

443
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:36,147
What are you guys doing here?

444
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:38,853
Wait, what's up
with the orange jumpsuits?

445
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:40,360
- Hey, no, no, question number one--
- It's kind of a Iong story. I--

446
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,056
- ...what's up with this party?
- What do you mean?

447
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:44,564
There's exposed vagina
aII over your house.

448
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,965
Yeah. That was my idea.

449
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:50,664
I don't know about you guys,
I'm sick of aII the hype over topIess.

450
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:53,105
ReaIIy? I aIways Iiked topIessness.
That's--

451
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:54,130
- That's just me.
- Yeah? WeII, I'm starting...

452
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:57,770
the bottomIess trend.
Hence, the bottomIess party.

453
00:24:57,812 --> 00:24:58,801
So what are you guys doing
in South Beach?

454
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:00,940
How about you answer that question?
I'm gonna go check this out.

455
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:02,711
- Where are you going?
- Bang bang, buddy.

456
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,082
Listen. I'm reaIIy sorry
to bother you with this.

457
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,780
- You aII right?
- Not reaIIy.

458
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:12,890
They were Iocked up for Iess than
an hour, and they aIready escaped?

459
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:15,760
Damn it. Make sure the press
doesn't get wind of this.

460
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:17,765
Don't need the pubIic thinking
we're some two-bit operation.

461
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:18,788
Got it, sir.

462
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,698
It must have been either aI-Qaeda
or North Korea who broke 'em up.

463
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:22,327
Find out if they have
any reIatives in the country.

464
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,396
You probabIy shouId have
done that in the first pIace.

465
00:25:30,378 --> 00:25:35,247
Do you have a probIem with the way
I'm running the show, Beecher?

466
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,615
I'm just saying that...

467
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:41,486
I've Iooked through the fiIes
on HaroId Lee and Kumar PateI.

468
00:25:41,522 --> 00:25:43,080
They were both born
and raised in New Jersey.

469
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,955
Other than a coupIe of traffic tickets,
they're cIean.

470
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:47,325
Right. That's why
they just broke out of prison.

471
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:50,229
But they--It's not even cIear that they
shouId have been there in the first pIace.

472
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:52,256
Shut your--

473
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,105
You see this cute, IittIe white girI,
Beecher?

474
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,473
Yeah.

475
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:06,446
Do you want her to get raped
and murdered?

476
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:08,838
Of course not.

477
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:11,613
You sure? 'Cause this is America.

478
00:26:12,186 --> 00:26:15,883
- Do you want to rape America?
- No.

479
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:19,360
Then stop fucking with me.

480
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:24,731
This is serious.

481
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:27,667
She's adorabIe.

482
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:31,566
So you guys are fucking fugitives?

483
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:33,836
It's just it's Kumar's fauIt.

484
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,775
If we get out of this...

485
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:39,177
the chances of us remaining friends
is highIy...

486
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:40,407
highIy--boobies. Yeah.

487
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:42,473
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

488
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,985
Put that back on. And keep it on.

489
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:47,146
- Sorry.
- Fuckin' party do you think this is?

490
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,281
Yo. What are you guys taIking about?

491
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:51,349
RoIdy was just Ietting me
in on your situation.

492
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:53,326
- Yeah?
- Thanks for getting me invoIved.

493
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,295
What about that fuckin' time
we had to cover for you...

494
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,093
Iie to your ex-girIfriend
about how you got crabs?

495
00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:58,291
You owe us, man.

496
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,630
- Yeah, that's right.
- What?

497
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,828
- OK, that was a Iong time ago.
- I Iove crabs.

498
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:03,666
Speaking of ex-girIfriends...

499
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,434
isn't yours getting married
or something?

500
00:27:05,473 --> 00:27:07,407
How does everybody know about this
except for me?

501
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:08,875
Wait.

502
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:12,038
CoIton! CoIton Graham can heIp us out.

503
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,445
- No! Fuck that!
- Yes!

504
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:16,177
No doubt. If anyone couId
cIear your names, it's him.

505
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,912
No, I'm sorry.
That dickweed is not heIping us.

506
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:19,886
Wait a second.
Do you have his contact info?

507
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:23,948
Not anymore. But the wedding is
at his famiIy's estate in Hewitt, Texas.

508
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:26,516
But you don't want to bother them
when they're doing their whoIe...

509
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,586
wedding thing, right?

510
00:27:30,498 --> 00:27:33,433
You know,
that actuaIIy might be our onIy hope.

511
00:27:33,468 --> 00:27:36,733
Fuck! How do we get there? We can't
go to the airport. They're Iooking for us.

512
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:38,363
- I'II Ioan you one of my cars.
- ReaIIy?

513
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:42,137
But first...y'aII got to get
in the spirit of the party.

514
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:45,373
- What do you mean, spirit of--
- What do you think I mean?

515
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,274
- What about you?
- Me? I've been in the spirit.

516
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,348
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God, dude!

517
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:53,615
Oh, my God!

518
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:55,485
- Love your dickdo, Raza.
- Yeah. Drink it in.

519
00:27:55,523 --> 00:27:58,720
- What the fuck?
- That Iooks Iike Osama bin Laden's beard.

520
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,990
I know, right? AII right, boys.

521
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:02,792
Your turn. Let 'em dangIe.

522
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:06,266
- Let's just do it.
- Bring it.

523
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,427
Count of three?

524
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,164
One.

525
00:28:10,204 --> 00:28:11,694
Two, three.

526
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,306
Your cocks are awesome, man!

527
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:18,676
That's not even necessary.

528
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:20,840
- WouId you pIease--
- Oh, my dick!

529
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:23,077
^ My dick cost a Iate-night fee ^

530
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,244
^ Your dick got the HIV ^

531
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,846
^ My dick pIays on
the doubIe feature screen ^

532
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:30,187

533
00:28:30,224 --> 00:28:32,784
^ My dick bigger than a bridge ^

534
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:35,125
^ Your dick Iook Iike a IittIe kid's ^

535
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:38,064

00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:39,862

00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:42,335

542
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,478
- This car is frickin' sweet.
- Yeah, yeah, it's sweet.

543
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,041
'Cause we're fugitives.

544
00:28:58,086 --> 00:29:01,078
Driving a yeIIow convertibIe
with the top down, dressed Iike asshoIes!

545
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:04,114
Yo. Yo. Yo, Iook, he has
one of these things.

546
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:06,149
- WouId you put that down?
- No, you can hook up to the Internet.

547
00:29:06,194 --> 00:29:08,856
You can pIay <i>Mike Ty</i>s<i>on'</i>s <i>Punch-Out</i>//
on it. King Hippo's going down.

548
00:29:08,896 --> 00:29:10,761
Put that away. Put that away.

549
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,598
I can't beIieve you can even think about
pIaying games at a time Iike this, man.

550
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:17,263
You reaIize what wouId happen
if our parents found out about this?

551
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,672
You have sent our sons
to Guantanamo Bay?

552
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:22,869
This is an outrage!

553
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:26,877
You Arabs think you can just mix in
with our peacefuI society...

554
00:29:26,914 --> 00:29:28,074
and we're not gonna find you, huh?

555
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:30,550
I am not Arab! I am Indian!

556
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:35,079
Look, Chief. I'm not here to argue
sebIantics with you, OK?

557
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:37,182
I'm here to save Iives.

558
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:40,319
Ask the Lees what they know
about their son's terrorist activity.

559
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:53,939
Look, we have been American citizens
for over 40 years.

560
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:57,467
Now, frankIy, I find this very offensive.

561
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:04,017
They're using some sort of diaIect
I've never heard before.

562
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:07,214
But I'm pretty sure he said something
about going on the offensive.

563
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,355
TeII them we know
what their son is up to...

564
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,260
and if they don't cooperate,
he couId be sentenced to death.

565
00:30:16,864 --> 00:30:19,059
Hit 'em. Yeah.

566
00:30:23,037 --> 00:30:24,971
We know what he said!

567
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:27,998
Sir, HaroId and Kumar are good boys.

568
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,909
I'm a pretty good transIator.

569
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:35,711
It's totaI gibberish.

570
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:38,975
They may be trying to stonewaII us.

571
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:42,186
Are you sure you speak Korean, Jack?

572
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:43,212
You speak Korean?

573
00:30:43,257 --> 00:30:45,054
You're not fucking with Daddy, are you?

574
00:30:45,092 --> 00:30:49,153
Do you have a masters
in romantic Korean Iiterature?

575
00:30:49,197 --> 00:30:51,222
Because I do...

576
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:52,823
and I'm offended.

577
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:55,024
Good enough for me.

578
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,097
Look, excuse me...

579
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:00,505
we're not Iooking to hurt your sons...

580
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,941
we just wanna know where they are.

581
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:05,172
Do you know if they know anybody
in FIorida?

582
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:09,680
Their friend Raza Syed Iives in Miami.

583
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:11,751
But why wouId they be there?

584
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,549
He's supposed to be in medicaI schooI.

585
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:18,753
They are supposed to be in prison!
That is where terrorists beIong!

586
00:31:21,395 --> 00:31:23,955
These fuckers are goin' down.

587
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:25,898
Dead. Or aIive.

588
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:29,232
TeII them that in your fake
ching-chong Ianguage.

589
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:32,737
Shut up! You're an idiot.

590
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:37,368
I don't know what you're saying, buddy...

591
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:38,400
but fuck you.

592
00:31:38,446 --> 00:31:39,538
- Fuck me?
- WiII you Iet him taIk to you Iike that?

593
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,775
- Listen, no, sit down.
- Fuck me?

594
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:51,952
Hey, Iook, man, we're in AIabama.

595
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:55,391
Wow, we actuaIIy get a first-hand Iook
at the South, huh?

596
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:58,990
Hey, this wasn't supposed to be a trip
through the South, OK?

597
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:01,524
This was supposed to be
the most romantic week of my Iife.

598
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:04,265
Remember that? Before you
fucked it up? You remember that?

599
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:06,500
Just chiII, OK?
We'II be out of this situation.

600
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,737
You'II be up in Maria's guts
in no time, aII right?

601
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:13,736
Hey. She's not some skank, man.

602
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:17,979
I've never feIt this way
about anyone before, reaIIy.

603
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:21,619
What the fuck?
Why am I taIking to you about this?

604
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:23,954
It's not Iike you wouId understand, so--

605
00:32:34,935 --> 00:32:37,096
^ I want to be happy ^

606
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:40,932
^ I want to be happy, just Iike-- ^

607
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:45,036
Excuse me, pIease.
WiII you turn that off? This is a Iibrary.

608
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:49,446
What a fucking chode.

609
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:51,474
Thank you, come again!

610
00:32:57,825 --> 00:32:59,952
- What the fuck?!
- Oh, my God.

611
00:32:59,994 --> 00:33:01,586
You know, the whoIe reason
peopIe come to the stacks...

612
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:04,154
is for some peace and...

613
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,724
quiet.

614
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:09,600
Look, I know, I'm sorry. I hate it
when peopIe disturb me here too.

615
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:12,765
It's just this fucking caIcuIus finaI
is kiIIing me.

616
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:18,210
- Do you mind if I take a Iook?
- No.

617
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:22,375
- You're actuaIIy very cIose. May I?
- Yeah.

618
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:24,213
Excuse me.

619
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:30,984
I touched your breast.

620
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:33,493
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

621
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,098
You just go--

622
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:43,035
Wow. You're good at this.

623
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,332
Thanks.

624
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:47,068
What did you, Iike, take caIcuIus
in high schooI or something?

625
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,100
ActuaIIy, my dad taught it to me
in sixth grade.

626
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:52,669
What, are you Iike Doogie Howser?

627
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:55,944
No. AIthough that wouId be incredibIe.
He's my hero.

628
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:58,474
I Iove that show.

629
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,114
What are you working on there?

630
00:34:01,155 --> 00:34:04,056
This is just a poem
for my creative writing cIass.

631
00:34:04,091 --> 00:34:06,423
It's Iike--

632
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,257
- <i>''The</i> S<i>qu</i>a<i>re Root Of Three</i>''?
- No, no, I'm sorry--

633
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:11,093
- ''A poem of Iove by Kumar PateI.''
- I need this.

634
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,191
- Hey, Iet me read it.
- No, no.

635
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:15,464
- Why?
- Because it's Iame.

636
00:34:15,503 --> 00:34:16,527
Then read it to me.

637
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,563
There's no way I'm Ietting you see me
in that Iight. Good Iuck with your caIcuIus.

638
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:25,978
Come on, don't be embarrassed. You
know, a Iot of girIs find inteIIigence sexy.

639
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:29,005
Look, I'm not even gonna be
showing this to my professor, aII right?

640
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:31,244
That's why I'm so stressed out
right now.

641
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:33,515
Stressed out, huh?

642
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:35,454
Come with me.

643
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,989
- ...going?
- Come on.

644
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,754
What?

645
00:34:48,102 --> 00:34:52,095
You're smoking drugs in the Iibrary?
What if somebody catches us?

646
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,368
Don't worry. It'II heIp you reIax.

647
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,877
Oh, boy.

648
00:34:57,912 --> 00:35:00,380
It's iIIegaI.

649
00:35:00,414 --> 00:35:05,147
^ I want your fish right by me ^

650
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:08,654
^ That's how it has to be ^

651
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,883
Here.

652
00:35:09,924 --> 00:35:12,518
^ --copacetic if you Iet it so set up ^

653
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,189
^ And keep the downstream down
and the upstream up ^

654
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:19,794
This is poison.

655
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:21,734
^ My stoney, my baby ^

656
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:23,430
Let me heIp you.

^ Time and time again struttin'

660
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:32,673
^ So screw it,
strip down and be generic ^

661
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,147
^ Strip down and be a passenger
Strip down and be a messenger ^

00:35:35,182 --> 00:35:37,810
^ In askin' why I'm born
I come up bIank in the winter ^

Vanessa.

667
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,694
You're stiII not reading that poem.

668
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,689
^ And then I kiss my stoney baby ^

669

- Kumar.

678
00:36:14,455 --> 00:36:17,720
What's going on? We're in Birmingham,
AIabama. Are we supposed to be here?

679
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,919
What's going on?

680
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,087
- Why did you bring us here, dude?
- What do you mean, why did I--

681
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:25,394
You were supposed to be foIIowing the
directions, asshoIe. What do you mean?

682
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:28,026
There's got to be Iike a highway
or something, right?

683
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:30,366
Yeah, there's got to be a highway.

684
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:33,170
What's going on up there?

685
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:34,572
^ Squad up ^

691
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,613

- Nah, just go through, man.

692
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:49,321
Dude, we're not driving
through this basketbaII game.

693
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:51,984
You know, RoIdy, I reaIIy thought
you were bigger than this.

694
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:54,358
Dude, I'm not scared
'cause they're bIack.

695
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:55,657
I'm scared because they're scary.

696
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:58,062
And it's not Iike we got
Gregory Hines out there.

697
00:36:58,098 --> 00:36:59,087
They're not that scary.

698
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,394
It's my baII!

699
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:04,904
Turn around.

700
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:07,908
^ Rob this motherfucker,
drop his punk ass in a ditch ^

701
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:10,843
^ Drag this pussy nigga,
sIap his ass up Iike a bitch ^

702
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:12,436
^ My niggas is my niggas

703
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:14,811

704
00:37:14,848 --> 00:37:16,315
^ Shoot him dead between his Iips ^

705
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,442
^ I see some pussy-- ^

706
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:19,976
- That's not good.
- Now there's no music, man.

707
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,612
Shit, man.

708
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:24,590

709
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,490
- Shit, this isn't good.
- This is not good. This is not good.

710
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,058
No. No. No.

711
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:31,621
They're coming over here.

712
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:36,599
- Fucking shit. Why did you do that?
- Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose.

713
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:40,005
They're getting weapons, man.

714
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,473
AII right, what do we do?
What do we do?

715
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:43,806
Run, run, run. Run, run.

716
00:37:49,216 --> 00:37:51,980
Yo. Yo.

717
00:37:52,886 --> 00:37:55,787
- Where y'aII going? Damn!
- We was just trying to heIp.

718
00:37:55,823 --> 00:37:59,987
Man, somebody caII the poIice.
We need to report this.

719
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:18,702
- Yeah, that's right. You Iike the ride?
- Fuck you, man.

720
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:23,376
They abandoned it Iast night.
It's registered to a Raza Syed.

721
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:25,908
The witnesses' description
of the driver and passenger...

722
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:28,786
match that of Lee and PateI.

723
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,151
We tried bringing in Syed Iast night,
but he's aIready Ieft the country.

724
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:38,230
WeII, they know we're cIosing in on 'em,
that's why.

725
00:38:38,265 --> 00:38:40,859
OK. No, I'II give you a caII. AII right.

726
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:44,696
No, no, no, no!

727
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:46,069
- HoIy shit!
- Easy, easy!

728
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:47,903
- Easy.
- Easy!

729
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:49,670
This is our witness.

730
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,575
Put it down! Yo, put it down!

731
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:52,738
You aII know I got one!

732
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,441
I got one too!

733
00:38:56,784 --> 00:39:01,016
So, you saw the fugitives, huh?

734
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:03,615
Yeah. It was Iike
I was teIIing the Sheriff--

735
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:07,593
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
How do I know you're teIIing the truth?

736
00:39:07,628 --> 00:39:09,493
I don't have a reason
to Iie to you, man.

737
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,895
ReaIIy?

738
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,729
- Get up in your face, man.
- We'II see.

739
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:15,598
That ain't right.

740
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:17,570
Where's he going?

741
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:21,001
What's going on?

742
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:25,734
HeII no!

743
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:28,111
Now why don't you teII me
what reaIIy happened?

744
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:30,013
Is that grape soda?

745
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,915
What the fuck, yo?

746
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:37,017
- AII right.
- HoId on, hoId on, hoId on!

747
00:39:37,057 --> 00:39:38,490
This is so ignorant.

748
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:40,516
- ReaIIy?
- Yes.

749
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:42,529
Is this ignorant?

750
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:45,054
Yo, that's racist, man. That's racist.

751
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:47,226
Hey, Jon, are you gonna Iet him do that?

752
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:50,299
See if he got KooI-Aid.

753
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:52,237
AImost gone, witness.

754
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:54,206
Sure there's not something
you wanna teII me?

755
00:39:54,241 --> 00:39:56,141
I'm not stoppin' untiI you crack!

756
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:57,268
I aIready toId you
that they took off runnin'!

757
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,642
AII right, aII right, aII right.

758
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:01,375
This isn't necessary!
Mr. White is teIIing you the truth!

759
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:03,975
Yeah, and how can you be
so sure, Beecher?

760
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:07,453
'Cause he doesn't have a poIice record.
He's an orthodontist, for Christ's sake.

761
00:40:09,523 --> 00:40:13,789
OK, then, Beech. How do you
propose we find the terrorists, huh?

762
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:17,495
There was a Nokia 77 10
taken from the consoIe.

763
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:18,793
We have its tracking numbers.

764
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:21,960
Our sateIIites are running a trace on it,
as we speak.

765
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,061
I'm serious about that KooI-Aid.

766
00:40:24,104 --> 00:40:25,332
What's going on? Where are you?

767
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:26,771
Dude, that is a fucking Iong story.

768
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:29,799
We're actuaIIy in AIabama right now,
heading to Texas.

769
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,438
What is that sound? Are you jerking off
again? What are you doing?

770
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,778
I'm taking a gIorious pee-pee.

771
00:40:35,816 --> 00:40:37,875
Hey, Iisten, you're not gonna beIieve this...

772
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:40,546
but the other night,
I ended up at that Asian party...

773
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:43,147
and I schtupped Cindy Kim.

774
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,158
Shut the fuck up. Are you serious?

775
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,319
Yeah, man,
she even gave me a bIumpkin.

776
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,623
What is a bIumpkin?

777
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:51,756
It's when a girI gives you head whiIe
you're sitting on the toiIet takin' a shit.

778
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:53,426
ReaIIy?

779
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:56,027
- HeIIo?
- Hey. Hey! What are you doing?

780
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:58,594
HeIIo? Come, come?

781
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,807
Did you go?

782
00:41:01,842 --> 00:41:03,309
Yeah, I'm done.

783
00:41:03,343 --> 00:41:06,278
You said to me we were gonna
cross swords. You promised.

784
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:08,110
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

785
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:12,778
Are you taIking on a ceIIphone
when the government is Iooking for us?

786
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,311
Dude, it was just GoIdstein.
I had something important to teII him.

787
00:41:15,355 --> 00:41:17,118
It's 'cause you had something--
That's good, that's OK.

788
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:22,720
Nothing is more important
than finding a way to get to Texas.

789
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:23,752
- Do you get it?
- Yes.

790
00:41:23,797 --> 00:41:28,200
We've been waIking an entire day
and we have not seen a street sign.

791
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,361
Do you get it?

792
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,668
- Can I say--
- Again. This is--I can't.

793
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:33,900
Dude, honestIy...

794
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:37,308
you've got to be a IittIe more positive
about these things, aII right?

795
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:40,609
- Yeah?
- Positive about what? I don't--

796
00:41:40,647 --> 00:41:44,048
First of aII, Iook at this beautifuI
AIabama Iandscape, OK?

797
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:47,178
You don't get shit Iike this in New Jersey.

798
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:49,420
God, you--

799
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:50,956
Hey, Iook, dude.

800
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:52,891
It's a baby deer.

801
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:57,255
- Wow. Man.
- Shit.

802
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,733
Hey. Hey.

803
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:06,227
Look how cute this deer is, dude. Not
Iike those asshoIe deer in New Jersey.

804
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,763
I know, man.

805
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:10,333
- Hey, buddy.
- Dude, AIabama's awesome.

806
00:42:10,377 --> 00:42:12,174
He Iikes you.

807
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:15,674
- Oh, my God!
- No!

808
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:21,620
Sorry about that. I was in my zone.

809
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:28,454
What the heII are y'aII doing out here
in them fancy cIothes?

810
00:42:28,495 --> 00:42:31,020
We were on our way to Texas
and we got Iost.

811
00:42:31,064 --> 00:42:32,554
Texas?

812
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:35,828
You're a Iong way from Texas.

813
00:42:36,169 --> 00:42:37,193
No!

814
00:42:40,874 --> 00:42:43,536
Born in '04.

815
00:42:43,577 --> 00:42:45,238
Get in here.

816
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:51,642
Yeah. The sun's about to go down.

817
00:42:51,685 --> 00:42:55,485
- Y'aII need a pIace to stay? Ya hungry?
- Yeah, sure.

818
00:42:55,522 --> 00:42:57,581
You want to foIIow me?

819
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,084
Come on.

820
00:43:01,094 --> 00:43:03,085
Maybe we shouIdn't.

821
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:06,494
It's aIready dead.
You need a hand, dude?

822
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:09,728
My grandpappy
bought this Iand in 1902.

823
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,238
Very nice, sir.

824
00:43:12,272 --> 00:43:14,502
This pIace is gonna suck.

825
00:43:18,578 --> 00:43:21,206
Honey, I'm home.

826
00:43:21,248 --> 00:43:22,681
^ <i>E</i> v<i>erao</i> ^

827
00:43:24,451 --> 00:43:27,682
^ <i>Atencao</i> ^

828
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:29,086
I'm in here.

829
00:43:32,492 --> 00:43:35,393
I wish you'd-a toId me
you was bringing guests home.

830
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:37,294
I'da straightened up in here.

831
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:39,424
FeIIas, this is my wife RayIene.

832
00:43:39,466 --> 00:43:42,094
RayIene, meet HaroId and Kumar.

833
00:43:42,135 --> 00:43:43,602
HeIIo.

834
00:43:43,637 --> 00:43:47,903
Can't shake.
I've just got...deer head aII over me.

835
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:50,239
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you boys.

836
00:43:50,277 --> 00:43:52,768
- You just make yourseIves at home.
- Thank you.

837
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:54,371
Honey, something's wrong
with that DSL.

838
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:57,474
Every time I go on the onIine,
it says, ''Searching for server.''

839
00:43:57,517 --> 00:43:59,382
You try unpIugging the AirPort base?

840
00:43:59,419 --> 00:44:01,546
Yeah, I done did that but it didn't work.

841
00:44:01,588 --> 00:44:03,112
What you need to go onIine fors,
anyways?

842
00:44:03,156 --> 00:44:06,284
I was gonna get one of them
new portabIe sateIIite radios.

843
00:44:06,326 --> 00:44:08,954
What the fuck
you need a sateIIite radio for?

844
00:44:08,996 --> 00:44:11,294
Don't you be cussin'
when we got company over.

845
00:44:11,331 --> 00:44:12,457
- Guys.
- PIease don't worry about us.

846
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:13,796
We cuss aII the time.

847
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:15,165
Who do you think you is, hitting me?

848
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:17,329
Who do you think bought you
that Prada bag?

849
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:19,236
I toId you I wanted a Gucci one.

850
00:44:19,272 --> 00:44:20,534
The Gucci bag cost more!

851
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,872
WeII, Jan Sapperstein's husband
sure couId afford it.

852
00:44:22,909 --> 00:44:25,070
Here we go again with Jan Sapperstein.

853
00:44:25,112 --> 00:44:27,376
I don't give a rat's ass what that bitch got.

854
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,676
You be happy with what you have.

855
00:44:28,715 --> 00:44:31,377
What I have is a husband
who ain't worth a turd!

856
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,783
You wanna give me shit now?

857
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:34,878
- That's right!
- After everything I Iet you buy!

858
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:36,320
Even Iook at the credit card biIIs?

859
00:44:36,356 --> 00:44:39,052
...you buy?! Do you think we need
another set of goIf baIIs?

860
00:44:39,092 --> 00:44:42,027
- Even worse is the credit card miIes.
- Stinky, smeIIy, motherf--

861
00:44:42,062 --> 00:44:43,859
Guys, we're just gonna get out of here.

862
00:44:43,897 --> 00:44:47,594
Nonsense. Don't be siIIy.
You're our guests.

863
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:50,102
You guys have got to stay for supper.

864
00:44:50,137 --> 00:44:51,729
- No, we couIdn't. That's--
- No, thank you. We reaIIy couIdn't--

865
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:56,175
Of course, we're gonna
have to get high first.

866
00:45:19,399 --> 00:45:21,390
We're cIose.

867
00:45:28,608 --> 00:45:31,236
This is news to me.
I never knew farmers smoked weed.

868
00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:34,736
You ever tried farmin' not high?
It's borin' as shit.

869
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:36,772
You know, this is great, guys.

870
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,910
I kind of aIways,
you know, sort of assumed...

871
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:42,319
that peopIe from the South
were kinda--

872
00:45:42,355 --> 00:45:44,255
A bunch of dumb rednecks?

873
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:46,919
- No.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not--

874
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,896
We do try to keep our inbred son in
the basement when we have company.

875
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:53,263
Guys, I didn't mean it Iike that. I was just--

876
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:59,235
Look at their faces!

877
00:46:04,578 --> 00:46:05,567
Fuck, fuck!

878
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:07,273
Shit, they found us.
They found us. They found us.

879
00:46:07,314 --> 00:46:08,906
- What do you mean, they found you?
- Listen, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

880
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:10,940
Are you boys in some kind of troubIe?

881
00:46:10,984 --> 00:46:13,817
AII right. This is gonna sound crazy,
but, basicaIIy...

882
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,116
we were on a pIane to Amsterdam...

883
00:46:15,155 --> 00:46:17,817
and we got mistaken for terrorists
and we got sent to Guantanamo Bay...

884
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,985
and then we escaped and snuck
into America with a bunch of Cubans...

885
00:46:20,026 --> 00:46:21,050
and now we're trying to get to Texas...

886
00:46:21,094 --> 00:46:22,083
where there's a guy
who can heIp us out...

887
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:24,029
and he's getting married
to Kumar's ex-girIfriend.

888
00:46:24,064 --> 00:46:25,793
Yes.

889
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:29,362
OK. That's cooI.

890
00:46:29,402 --> 00:46:31,836
- I understand that.
- You do?

891
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:36,104
Like the government's never screwed
us over before. You know what?

892
00:46:36,143 --> 00:46:38,202
Y'aII come down here and hide
in the basement. I wiII handIe this.

893
00:46:38,245 --> 00:46:39,678
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, both.

894
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,681
Thank you, thank you.

895
00:46:51,057 --> 00:46:53,992
OK. This isn't creepy.

896
00:46:57,531 --> 00:46:58,964
What the heII is that?

897
00:47:00,867 --> 00:47:03,563
You're waIking
towards the creepy music?

898
00:47:04,137 --> 00:47:05,399
Ge--

899
00:47:05,438 --> 00:47:06,996
This song rocks, dude.

900
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,769
Kumar.

901
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:24,051
Hey, dude, there's a Iighter here
with a cIown on it.

902
00:47:25,525 --> 00:47:27,049
Jesus Christ, there's a fucking monster!

903
00:47:27,827 --> 00:47:28,885
God!

904
00:47:39,973 --> 00:47:43,136
Hey, you don't happen to have
a Baby Ruth on you, do you?

905
00:47:43,176 --> 00:47:45,736
No. Why do you need a Baby Ruth?

906
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,714
That's how Chunk won over SIoth
in <i>The Goonie</i>s.

907
00:47:48,748 --> 00:47:50,682
This thing Iooks Iike SIoth?

908
00:47:50,717 --> 00:47:52,878
AII I saw was the creature's hand.

909
00:47:52,919 --> 00:47:54,614
The hand Iooks Iike SIoth?

910
00:47:54,654 --> 00:47:58,784
The fucking hand of an eviI monster,
dude. Like fucking cIaws and shit.

911
00:47:58,825 --> 00:48:00,622
Shit.

912
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:05,029
Listen, no matter what, don't Iet
the creature know that it's ugIy, OK?

913
00:48:05,065 --> 00:48:07,966
The Iast thing that we want to do
is criticize it or make it feeI different...

914
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:10,731
just because it was born
with horribIe deformities.

915
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:24,512
Don't worry. I got rid of 'em.
It was just my neighbors.

916
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:25,575
- There's a fricking CycIops--
- No, you got--

917
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,678
- ...in your basement, man!
- ...a fucking thing, dude!

918
00:48:27,721 --> 00:48:28,915
You met Cyrus.

919
00:48:28,955 --> 00:48:30,149
- Cyrus.
- You named it?

920
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,418
Our son.

921
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:34,393
You must have woke him up. He was
supposed to be asIeep. I'm sorry.

922
00:48:34,427 --> 00:48:36,019
I thought you were joking...

923
00:48:36,062 --> 00:48:38,587
when you said you had an inbred son
who Iives in your basement.

924
00:48:38,632 --> 00:48:40,259
WeII, it ain't a joke.

925
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,599
RayIene and I here are sibIings,
and we get it on.

926
00:48:43,637 --> 00:48:45,935
But that don't mean
we ought to be judged.

927
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:48,736
You boys must be awfuI tired
after what you've been through.

928
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:50,208
Come with me,
I'II show you to your bed.

929
00:48:50,243 --> 00:48:52,268
You better go back to sIeep, boy!

930
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:55,304
Don't make me come down there
and whip your CycIops ass!

931
00:48:57,617 --> 00:48:59,278
It's tough Iove.

932
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:01,310
It's the best way.

933
00:49:19,105 --> 00:49:22,165
I don't know what I was thinking
dating that douchebag CoIton.

934
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:25,507
He is a douchebag.
What were you thinking?

935
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:29,242
But it was agony pretending
his puny, IittIe penis satisfied me.

936
00:49:29,282 --> 00:49:33,844
I bet. I bet you've been missing
the thundercock too, haven't you, baby?

937
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,151
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

938
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:37,816
Yeah, you've been missing it?

939
00:49:37,857 --> 00:49:38,983
How much?

940
00:49:39,025 --> 00:49:41,926
- A Iot.
- I bet.

941
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:44,726
WeII...

942
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:48,393
- I kind of have this fantasy.
- What is it?

943
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:52,496
I thought it'd be kinda cooI
to bring somebody eIse in bed with us.

944
00:49:53,707 --> 00:49:55,572
Who?

945
00:49:55,608 --> 00:49:57,337
Hey, baby.

946
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,278
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

947
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:08,116
- Yeah.
- She's hot, right?

948
00:50:08,154 --> 00:50:09,178
Let's do it.

949
00:50:09,222 --> 00:50:11,713
- ^ There's something ^
- ^ About that woman ^

950
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:15,159
^ She's got something
you can't Iive without ^

951
00:50:15,195 --> 00:50:17,959
^ Makes your heart sing ^

952
00:50:17,997 --> 00:50:19,589
Faster, Weedy.

953
00:50:19,632 --> 00:50:21,691
^ Something about that woman ^

954
00:50:21,735 --> 00:50:25,193
^ If you're in doubt
then you are missing out ^

955
00:50:25,238 --> 00:50:27,729
^ On a good thing ^

956
00:50:28,742 --> 00:50:31,006
^ I got to give it up ^

957
00:50:31,044 --> 00:50:33,774
Teeth, teeth, Weedy, teeth.

958
00:50:36,216 --> 00:50:37,911
- Weedy!
- Yeah?

959
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,818
- Yeah!
- You Iike that?

960
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:51,160
Putting it in the ass now, Weedy.

961
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:55,191
Yeah, how about that?

962
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:57,294
^ Something about that woman ^

963
00:50:57,337 --> 00:51:00,773
^ She's got something
you can't Iive without ^

964
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,775
^ Makes your heart sing ^

965
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:07,241
^ It's just something about that woman ^

966
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,943
^ If you're in doubt
then you are missing out ^

967
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,544
^ On a good thing ^

968
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,083
^ I got to give it up ^

969
00:51:22,061 --> 00:51:23,323
Wow.

970
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:29,733
Dude.

971
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,831
I just had the most
fucked-up nightmare.

972
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:36,933
Come on, man.
I was having a reaIIy hot dream.

973
00:51:36,976 --> 00:51:39,638
Go back to bed, pIease, dude.

974
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:14,214
Why did we have to Ieave?
Their <i>Goonie</i>s chiId was kind of cute.

975
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,739
I don't care. It tried to fucking bite me.

976
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:18,876
Jesus, every time the two of us
try to get anywhere...

977
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:21,614
it's fucking disaster
after fucking disaster.

978
00:52:21,654 --> 00:52:23,417
Jesus, dude.
Here, you reaIIy need a hit of this.

979
00:52:23,456 --> 00:52:26,050
Dude, I don't want a fucking hit!

980
00:52:26,092 --> 00:52:28,390
It's your soIution to everything,
you know that?

981
00:52:28,428 --> 00:52:31,397
Think about it.
We shouId be at CoIton's aIready.

982
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:34,696
Hey, chiII, we stiII have two days
to fuck up the wedding.

983
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,793
- What?
- What?

984
00:52:37,303 --> 00:52:38,895
- What?
- What?

985
00:52:39,339 --> 00:52:43,673
That's what this is aII about, isn't it?
You want to fuck up the wedding.

986
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,043
It's not fucking funny, Kumar.
It's not fucking funny!

987
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,573
CoIton is the onIy guy
that can heIp us out at this point.

988
00:52:49,616 --> 00:52:52,244
I can't beIieve--I cannot beIieve
you're wiIIing to fuck that up!

989
00:52:52,285 --> 00:52:54,185
I just hate that fucking asshoIe, OK?

990
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,984
Yeah? I Iike him better

991
00:52:57,023 --> 00:52:59,218
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.

992
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,250
You know what he got me? A job.

993
00:53:01,294 --> 00:53:05,230
You know what you got me?
Thrown into Guantanamo Bay.

994
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,960
- Your job sucks.
- Admit it.

995
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,833
You're jeaIous because Vanessa
found somebody better than you.

996
00:53:09,869 --> 00:53:11,427
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

997
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:14,065
Better than you! Let me think.

998
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:17,599
PotentiaI future president,
or unempIoyed pothead?

999
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:20,169
Tough. That's tough.
That's a tough one for her, isn't it?

1000
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:22,511
Yeah, weII at Ieast
Vanessa's not in Amsterdam...

1001
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:24,380
getting pIowed
by a bunch of European dudes.

1002
00:53:25,552 --> 00:53:27,019
- What?
- Do you reaIIy think Maria's...

1003
00:53:27,053 --> 00:53:28,520
saving herseIf for you, dude?

1004
00:53:28,555 --> 00:53:30,489
Right now, she's probabIy got
two uncircumcised dicks...

1005
00:53:30,523 --> 00:53:31,615
dangIing in front of her throat.

1006
00:53:31,658 --> 00:53:35,116
You know what she's gonna do with them?
Down 'em into her tonsiIs?

1007
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:41,592
Fucking dick.

1008
00:53:44,904 --> 00:53:47,270
- That's my hat.
- That was my hat, bro.

1009
00:53:49,642 --> 00:53:51,303
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria.

1010
00:53:51,711 --> 00:53:53,201
AsshoIe!

1011
00:53:53,246 --> 00:53:56,079
Don't you dare say a fucking word
about my angeI!

1012
00:53:58,551 --> 00:54:00,382
What the fuck was that?

1013
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,479
Get up. Get up!

1014
00:54:02,522 --> 00:54:04,490
Fuck you.

1015
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,292
Shit.

1016
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,773
Isn't that a KKK bonfire?

1017
00:54:21,808 --> 00:54:22,968
Yeah.

1018
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,244
Yeah, I think it is.

1019
00:54:27,046 --> 00:54:29,241
Maybe we shouId
get the fuck out of here.

1020
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:31,307
Yeah. Yeah, dude.

1021
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,683
Let's do that.

1022
00:54:36,656 --> 00:54:39,489
The other day, caught a rerun
of that show <i>Becker</i>.

1023
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:40,958
You know that show?

1024
00:54:40,994 --> 00:54:44,430
Yeah, that's the one
with that Jew, Ted Danson.

1025
00:54:44,464 --> 00:54:47,900
That bIond negro they got on there,
he had me in stitches.

1026
00:54:47,934 --> 00:54:49,492
He's actuaIIy pretty funny.

1027
00:54:49,535 --> 00:54:51,765
ReaIIy? You think so?

1028
00:54:51,804 --> 00:54:54,602
I'm not saying I wouIdn't
Iynch the guy, but...

1029
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:57,439
his timing, it's priceIess.

1030
00:54:58,177 --> 00:55:00,475
HoId up a second.

1031
00:55:00,513 --> 00:55:03,175
I gotta go drain the main vein.

00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:38,008
Kenny, come on, man.
Hurry the fuck up.

1038
00:55:38,951 --> 00:55:42,352
You were the one who made me
drink that third beer.

1039
00:55:42,388 --> 00:55:44,822
HoId your horses, peckerwood.

1040
00:55:45,692 --> 00:55:48,092
Gross! You fucking pissed on me!

1041
00:55:48,127 --> 00:55:50,425
- You racist fuck!
- What the heck?

1042
00:55:57,203 --> 00:55:59,228
What the nigger was that?

1043
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,868
This is fucked. We are fucked.

1044
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:05,810
Kenny. Travis.

1045
00:56:07,346 --> 00:56:10,008

1046
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:12,210

1048
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:15,917
Let's go, come on!

1049
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:29,963
Yeah, then you put IittIe onions on 'em
and you steam 'em, they're awesome.

1050
00:56:30,002 --> 00:56:33,597
RoIdy, dude, I'd never thought
I'd say this in a miIIion years...

1051
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:35,231
but the KIan reaIIy knows how to party.

1052
00:56:35,274 --> 00:56:37,105
You gotta try these dogs.

1053
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,132
- ReaIIy?
- Oh, yeah.

1054
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:40,873

1066
00:57:08,841 --> 00:57:11,071
at the WaI-Mart the other day.

1067
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,941
Guy crashed into a bunch of wine bottIes.

1068
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,807
They made him pay for 'em! Yeah!

1069

00:57:25,391 --> 00:57:27,256
Giving him what he deserves.

1072

Hebe!

Come on, dude, say something.

00:57:44,076 --> 00:57:45,873
You know what?

1077
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,538
I did knee an Indian guy in the baIIs.

1078
00:57:49,582 --> 00:57:50,606
That's funny!

1079
00:57:52,285 --> 00:57:54,617
Yeah, send them Indians back to Africa.

1080
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:58,783
WeII, you want to hear something reaI
fucked-up and awesome that I did?

1081
00:57:58,825 --> 00:58:03,558
I took a Korean guy's toothbrush
and I rubbed it aII over my dick.

1082
00:58:03,596 --> 00:58:07,532
- You did that?

00:58:10,503 --> 00:58:12,801

1094
00:58:46,339 --> 00:58:49,331

Dude, the KIan is fucking sIow.

What are you doing here, man?

1109
00:59:21,407 --> 00:59:24,865
This is where God took me.
What are you guys doing out here?

1110
00:59:24,911 --> 00:59:27,402
We're actuaIIy trying to get to Texas.

1111
00:59:27,446 --> 00:59:28,811
That's where I'm headed!

1112
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:31,338
What are the odds?

1113
00:59:32,251 --> 00:59:33,240
Let's get out of here.

1114
00:59:33,286 --> 00:59:34,844
- AII right.

1115
00:59:35,521 --> 00:59:36,510

00:59:45,398 --> 00:59:47,423
GentIemen, start your engines.

1119
00:59:48,234 --> 00:59:50,566
It's gonna be a bumpy fuckin' ride.

1120
00:59:50,603 --> 00:59:52,503
^ 'Cause shotgun buIIets
are bad for your heaIth ^

1121
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,878
We found their phone.

1122
01:00:00,746 --> 01:00:03,374
Lee and PateI made a phone caII to you.

1123
01:00:05,251 --> 01:00:07,446
Now teII us everything you know
about their terrorist pIot.

1124
01:00:07,486 --> 01:00:10,512
Terrorist pIot? RoId and Kumar?

1125
01:00:10,556 --> 01:00:12,786
This is ridicuIous.

1126
01:00:12,825 --> 01:00:15,385
OK, fine. Fine.

1127
01:00:15,428 --> 01:00:17,988
Mr. Rosenberg.

1128
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:20,863
Mr. GoId-stein.

1129
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:23,894
We'II do it your way.

1130
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,971
What's this? What do we have here?

1131
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,565
It's about seven doIIars?

1132
01:00:59,605 --> 01:01:01,266
Look, don't insuIt us, aII right?

1133
01:01:01,307 --> 01:01:02,774
I don't know
what the heII is going on here...

1134
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:05,538
but I'm pIeading the Fifth
untiI I speak to my Iawyer.

1135
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,842
You're pIeading the Fifth, huh?

1136
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:10,949
Beecher, give me a copy
of the BiII of Rights.

1137
01:01:10,983 --> 01:01:12,507
The BiII of Rights? Why?

1138
01:01:12,551 --> 01:01:14,610
Just do it!

1139
01:01:14,653 --> 01:01:16,587
Excuse me.

1140
01:01:18,824 --> 01:01:19,813
Five, right?

1141
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:21,156
- Five aIive.
- Sure.

1142
01:01:21,193 --> 01:01:23,753
OK. OK. Good.

1143
01:01:26,165 --> 01:01:29,532
You wanna know what I think
about the Fifth Amendment?

1144
01:01:37,043 --> 01:01:38,476
There it is.

1145
01:01:45,151 --> 01:01:47,984
That's what I think
of the Fifth Amendment.

1146
01:01:50,923 --> 01:01:53,619
Why the heII is your ass so dirty?
Don't you wipe?

1147
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:57,220
Don't ask questions
you don't want the answer to, buddy.

1148
01:01:57,263 --> 01:01:58,252
What do ya got?

1149
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:01,357
Turns out the FBI was aIready
tapping Mr. GoIdstein's phone.

1150
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,163
- We got what we need.
- Wait a second.

1151
01:02:03,202 --> 01:02:05,534
You were tapping my phone?

1152
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:06,560
You want to hear the tape?

1153
01:02:06,605 --> 01:02:10,837
No. I'm sick of Iistening
to this dirt farmer. What's the upshot?

1154
01:02:10,876 --> 01:02:13,344
Lee and PateI are on their way
to Texas as we speak.

1155
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,540
I knew they'd trip up.

1156
01:02:15,581 --> 01:02:19,381
Ready the pIane.
These fuckers are goin' down.

1157
01:02:26,425 --> 01:02:30,054
NeiI, can you just focus on driving?
You've had--Focus on the road.

1158
01:02:30,096 --> 01:02:32,656
You've had dozens of shrooms,
my friend.

1159
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:36,426
Dude, I was abIe to perform
an appendectomy at age 14.

1160
01:02:36,469 --> 01:02:39,632
I think I can handIe
a coupIe mushrooms.

1161
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:43,199
- Wasn't that just a TV show?
- Jesus Christ!

1162
01:02:43,242 --> 01:02:46,040
Did you see that unicorn?

1163
01:02:46,078 --> 01:02:47,841
Its horn was so shiny.

1164
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:52,340
So, why are you guys headed to Texas?

1165
01:02:52,384 --> 01:02:55,285
Let's just say
my ex-girIfriend's getting married.

1166
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,492
The one that got away, huh?

1167
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:02,187
Yep.

1168
01:03:02,228 --> 01:03:04,219
Sounds to me Iike you need a drink.

1169
01:03:05,064 --> 01:03:07,362
Road. NeiI, pIease,
can you pay attention--

1170
01:03:07,399 --> 01:03:09,333
Dude, I've got it!

1171
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:12,269
- Yeah, but--
- He's a good driver. Stop.

1172
01:03:12,304 --> 01:03:15,364
Thanks, man. Cheers, dude.

1173
01:03:15,407 --> 01:03:16,533
ReaIIy? Drinking?

1174
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,942
I have a Iost-Iove story of my own.

1175
01:03:25,985 --> 01:03:26,974
Yeah?

1176
01:03:27,686 --> 01:03:29,950
Happened on the set of <i>C</i>/a<i>r</i>a<i>'</i>s <i>He</i>a<i>rt</i>.

1177
01:03:29,989 --> 01:03:31,479
Sure, sure, yeah.

1178
01:03:31,524 --> 01:03:35,016
I'II never forget her.
Her name was Tashonda.

1179
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,891
She was Whoopi GoIdberg's stand-in.

1180
01:03:36,929 --> 01:03:40,922
Her skin was so soft,
her Iips were so sweet.

1181
01:03:42,034 --> 01:03:46,937
She had these tiny,
IittIe Hershey Kiss nippIes...

1182
01:03:47,706 --> 01:03:50,834
that you just wanted
to suck on aII night Iong.

1183
01:03:51,343 --> 01:03:54,608
Anyway, Iast day of shooting, I toId her.

1184
01:03:54,647 --> 01:03:56,410
I said...

1185
01:03:56,448 --> 01:04:00,179
''T-Bird, we're gonna have to break up.''

1186
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:01,811
Why did you do that?

1187
01:04:02,788 --> 01:04:05,723
I didn't think I couId take on
that kind of responsibiIity.

1188
01:04:07,326 --> 01:04:10,318
It was such a big mistake.

1189
01:04:10,362 --> 01:04:12,694
Why? I mean, with T-Bird gone...

1190
01:04:12,731 --> 01:04:15,063
couIdn't you have sex
with whoever you wanted?

1191
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,294
Let me be cIear.

1192
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:18,200
There is nothing on the pIanet...

1193
01:04:18,237 --> 01:04:20,535
that I Iove more than a hot, new pussy.

1194
01:04:20,573 --> 01:04:22,097
- Sure.
- Nothing.

1195
01:04:22,141 --> 01:04:24,234
What does the P.H. stands for in N.P.H.?

1196
01:04:25,511 --> 01:04:26,603
Patrick Harris.

1197
01:04:26,645 --> 01:04:29,273
No, common mistake. Poon handIer.

1198
01:04:30,182 --> 01:04:31,843
The point is, boys...

1199
01:04:31,884 --> 01:04:36,480
even though I Iove havin' sex
with some hot, random trim...

1200
01:04:36,522 --> 01:04:41,482
a day hasn't gone by
where I haven't thought of Tashonda.

1201
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:47,663
Every time I see a bag of
Hershey's Kisses, my baIIs get so wet.

1202
01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:54,763
Here's to you, Tashonda.

1203
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:59,103
- I hope you kept the baby.
- Wow.

1204
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:28,164
^ Free on my own ^

1205
01:05:28,207 --> 01:05:31,267
^ That's the way I used to be ^

1206
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:32,868
^ But since I met you, baby ^

1207
01:05:32,911 --> 01:05:35,072
Hey, honey.
What's up?

1208
01:05:35,114 --> 01:05:37,742
I found something in your purse.

1209
01:05:38,617 --> 01:05:40,084
Why wouId you go through my purse?

1210
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:41,780
Why wouId you have a joint...

1211
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:44,914
when you know
it couId ruin my poIiticaI career?

1212
01:05:44,957 --> 01:05:46,015
I'm sorry.

1213
01:05:46,058 --> 01:05:50,324
What with aII the wedding pIans,
I've just been a IittIe stressed.

1214
01:05:50,362 --> 01:05:52,296
It heIps me reIax?

1215
01:05:52,331 --> 01:05:55,789
Marijuana is iIIegaI, Vanessa.

1216
01:05:55,834 --> 01:05:57,665
Now, I thought that part of your Iife
was in the past.

1217
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:00,137
- It is.
- Good.

1218
01:06:01,507 --> 01:06:02,599
That's aII I need to hear.

1219
01:06:05,244 --> 01:06:08,042
Hey, baby.

1220
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:11,413
Look, I know things can be hectic
with the wedding.

1221
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:15,819
But, you know, if you get stressed out,
just do what I do.

1222
01:06:15,854 --> 01:06:17,879
Snort ZoIoft, OK?

1223
01:06:25,497 --> 01:06:27,795
What the fuck?

1224
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:28,822
Shit.

1225
01:06:28,867 --> 01:06:32,325
Dude, they set up a fucking roadbIock!
They're gonna find us.

1226
01:06:32,371 --> 01:06:34,168
- What are you taIking about?
- NeiI...

1227
01:06:34,206 --> 01:06:36,401
I don't know how to say this
any other way, man, but we're fugitives.

1228
01:06:36,442 --> 01:06:38,034
CooI.

1229
01:06:39,378 --> 01:06:41,676
OK, weII, we've got to find a way
to get out of this.

1230
01:06:41,714 --> 01:06:43,341
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- PIease.

1231
01:06:43,382 --> 01:06:47,284
You act Iike I've never smuggIed
a fugitive across state Iines before.

1232
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:49,617
Here. Hide in that.

1233
01:06:49,655 --> 01:06:52,021
Sorry. It's a IittIe sticky.

1234
01:06:54,426 --> 01:06:56,223
Shit.

1235
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,590
Yeah.

1236
01:07:04,803 --> 01:07:06,964
What the--When were you
gonna show me these?

1237
01:07:15,214 --> 01:07:17,148
Excuse me.

1238
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:19,076
Wait, Officer!

1239
01:07:20,018 --> 01:07:22,452
- Shit.
- HoId that car!

1240
01:07:36,402 --> 01:07:40,338
NeiI Patrick Harris.

1241
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,664
Yo.

1242
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:47,909
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

1243
01:07:47,946 --> 01:07:50,437
Yeah. I wouId imagine so.

1244
01:07:52,484 --> 01:07:54,418
I'm sure you get this aII the time...

1245
01:07:54,453 --> 01:08:01,325
but your part in S<i>t</i>a<i>r</i>s<i>hip Trooper</i>s
truIy, truIy changed my Iife.

1246
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,657
ReaIIy?

1247
01:08:02,694 --> 01:08:04,491
How?

1248
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:09,729
WeII, no one thought the war against
the arachnids of KIendathu couId be won.

1249
01:08:09,768 --> 01:08:11,201
- But you showed the starship troopers--
- NeiI!

1250
01:08:11,236 --> 01:08:13,170
...that those bugs couId be destroyed.

1251
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:19,673
A Iot of peopIe think the war on terror
is a war that can't be won, right?

1252
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:23,539
That's why I joined
the Department of HomeIand Security.

1253
01:08:23,582 --> 01:08:28,212
My friend, two words.
S<i>t</i>a<i>r</i>s<i>hip</i> fuckin' <i>Trooper</i>s.

1254
01:08:28,253 --> 01:08:32,451
If you want to know the secret of being,
you wiII come with us.

1255
01:08:33,792 --> 01:08:35,817
PIease. I reaIIy need to go.

1256
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:39,729
Yeah, of course. I'm so sorry
to bother you. You move aIong.

1257
01:08:42,935 --> 01:08:44,903
Bye.

1258
01:08:45,537 --> 01:08:46,902
I Iove you.

1259
01:08:50,142 --> 01:08:51,973
I Iove you too, Mr. Patrick Harris.

1260
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:54,639
What the--

1261
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,817
HoIy fucking shit, that was awesome.

1262
01:09:04,823 --> 01:09:06,916
Try having that conversation
on shrooms.

1263
01:09:06,959 --> 01:09:08,824
I deserve an Oscar
for that performance.

1264
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:09,850
- You do!
- Dudes...

1265
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,760
I'm gonna take a IittIe detour
on the way, aII right?

1266
01:09:11,797 --> 01:09:12,786
- No.
- NeiI, no.

1267
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,820
But we're aImost there, man.

1268
01:09:13,866 --> 01:09:15,993
- No buts. No buts!
- What do you do--

1269
01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:18,969
I'm going to a whorehouse
and I'm gonna get my fuck on.

1270
01:09:19,004 --> 01:09:23,532
If you two don't want to get
your dicks wet, that's fine with me.

1271
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,370
I'II get my dick wet.

1272
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:36,751
^ Don't need nothin' but a good time ^

1273
01:09:36,788 --> 01:09:39,416
^ How can I resist? ^

1274
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:43,394
^ Ain't Iookin' for nothin'
but a good time ^

1275
01:09:43,428 --> 01:09:47,262
^ And it don't get better than this ^

1276
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:51,133
Pussy, I'm home!

1277
01:09:51,169 --> 01:09:52,636
HeIIo?

1278
01:09:53,438 --> 01:09:58,603
WeII, weII, weII. I thought you'd never
show your face around here again.

1279
01:09:58,644 --> 01:10:01,408
What's the matter, SaIIy? I thought
I was one of your top customers.

1280
01:10:01,446 --> 01:10:04,540
Have you forgotten what happened
the Iast time you were here?

1281
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:07,818
Because of you, my best girI quit.

1282
01:10:07,853 --> 01:10:09,650
Hey, I paid her good money.

1283
01:10:09,688 --> 01:10:11,315
It's not my fauIt
she didn't Iube up.

1284
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:15,053
Besides, I bring you new customers.

1285
01:10:15,093 --> 01:10:18,221
- New customers?
- No, NeiI, that's aII.

1286
01:10:18,263 --> 01:10:20,288
Thank you. Thank you.
Appreciate it. Appreciate it.

1287
01:10:20,332 --> 01:10:22,562
SaIIy. Bring on the Iineup.

1288
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,295
Line up in the chutes, girIs.

1289
01:10:27,339 --> 01:10:30,172
Longhorns coming through.

1290
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:31,300
NeiI.

1291
01:10:35,247 --> 01:10:38,080
Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger.

1292
01:10:38,116 --> 01:10:39,981
HeIIo, ba--

1293
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:43,883
- What's your name, miss?
- Tits Hemingway.

1294
01:10:43,922 --> 01:10:45,480
How'd you come up with that?

1295
01:10:45,524 --> 01:10:47,458
WeII, I have huge tits.

1296
01:10:47,492 --> 01:10:49,892
And my favorite book
is <i>A Mo</i>v<i>e</i>a<i>b</i>/<i>e Fe</i>as<i>t</i>.

1297
01:10:49,928 --> 01:10:52,488
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

1298
01:10:52,531 --> 01:10:54,089
WeII, I hope you're ready for me, Tits...

1299
01:10:54,132 --> 01:10:56,430
'cause I'm gonna rock out
with my cock out...

1300
01:10:56,468 --> 01:10:58,197
and you're gonna jam out
with your cIam out.

1301
01:10:58,236 --> 01:10:59,931
It's gonna be magicaI.

1302
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,773
- The whores are on me, feIIas.
- No, NeiI...

1303
01:11:02,808 --> 01:11:04,605
- thank you, but we--that's--
- Thanks, dude.

1304
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:06,133
Screw that, RoIdy.
I don't know about you...

1305
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:09,545
but, no offense to the rest of you Iadies,
I am gonna be taking you two.

1306
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:12,216
No, Kumar. Kumar!

1307
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,740
RoIdy, you're missing out, brother.

1308
01:11:14,653 --> 01:11:16,678
Yo, we need to get back on the road,
buddy.

1309
01:11:16,722 --> 01:11:18,155
We need--

1310
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:24,595
WeII, now, you know, we aIso suppIy...

1311
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:28,259
in-room fiIms or a magazine.

1312
01:11:30,268 --> 01:11:32,896
WeII, if you'd Iike
some seIf-satisfaction...

1313
01:11:32,938 --> 01:11:35,031
we do have some...

1314
01:11:36,775 --> 01:11:39,141
eIectronic devices right over there.

1315
01:11:42,581 --> 01:11:45,175
Just have some coffee. Yeah?

1316
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:48,050
Why don't you Iie on the bed?

1317
01:11:48,086 --> 01:11:50,577
And teII us what you want us to do.

1318
01:11:50,622 --> 01:11:52,988
OK. OK.

1319
01:11:54,326 --> 01:11:55,953
WeII...

1320
01:11:57,496 --> 01:11:59,327
how about--

1321
01:12:00,332 --> 01:12:02,800
How about you take off your cIothes
and make out with each other?

1322
01:12:02,834 --> 01:12:05,234
- We've done that before.
- We can do that.

1323
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:06,362
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1324
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,168

01:12:36,501 --> 01:12:38,901
^ He gotta pay for pussy ^

1339
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:40,734
Can you use tongue?

1340
01:12:40,772 --> 01:12:43,002
^ That pussy, pussy ^

1341
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:44,702
^ Pussy, pussy ^

1342
01:12:46,311 --> 01:12:48,040
Bump your titty on her titty.

1343
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,513
^ PoIice puII me over ^

1344
01:12:49,548 --> 01:12:51,539
^ They don't write no tickets ^

1345
01:12:52,651 --> 01:12:54,551
Boner achieved!

1346
01:12:55,587 --> 01:12:59,114
Great. Now Iet's get those pants off.

1347
01:12:59,157 --> 01:13:00,488
OK.

1348
01:13:01,026 --> 01:13:04,291
- You are benevoIent human beings.
- Yeah, I know.

1349
01:13:04,329 --> 01:13:05,694
- Yeah?
- We get that a Iot.

1350
01:13:05,797 --> 01:13:07,560
Yeah. You know what that means,
benevoIent?

1351
01:13:07,599 --> 01:13:09,191
Yeah, I do, actuaIIy.

1352
01:13:09,234 --> 01:13:10,496
What?

1353
01:13:10,535 --> 01:13:12,696
It means we're gonna fuck you so hard...

1354
01:13:12,738 --> 01:13:15,104
your dick's gonna be sore for two weeks.

1355
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:18,268
That is exactIy, exactIy what it means.

1356
01:13:19,344 --> 01:13:22,245
You know what bothers me
the most, though?

1357
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,408
He never once apoIogized
for getting me into aII this troubIe.

1358
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:30,444
I mean, I'm supposed to be with my
Maria right now in Amsterdam, OK?

1359
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:33,925
But it's cooI.
He doesn't know how to say ''I'm sorry.''

1360
01:13:34,359 --> 01:13:36,156
Why do you think that is?

1361
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:40,631
SparkIe, because it's aII about
what he wants. It's about him, him, him.

1362
01:13:40,665 --> 01:13:43,862
You know. I don't even care
because--You know--

1363
01:13:43,902 --> 01:13:46,666
if he can't be a good friend to me,
I'm not gonna be a good friend to him.

1364
01:13:46,705 --> 01:13:48,866
- It's done.
- Don't say that.

1365
01:13:49,307 --> 01:13:51,275
A good friend is hard to come by.

1366
01:13:51,309 --> 01:13:52,742
Venus, come on.

1367
01:13:52,778 --> 01:13:56,009
Yeah, but if he was a reaI friend,
he wouId know how to say, ''I'm sorry.''

1368
01:13:56,081 --> 01:13:57,412
That's right.

1369
01:13:57,449 --> 01:13:59,440
Thank you, Agnes.

1370
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:01,341
NaiI on the head.

1371
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,312
It's Iike right now...

1372
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:08,292
after aII the shit that we have
been through in the Iast few days...

1373
01:14:08,326 --> 01:14:13,525
you know, he's in there having
the time of his Iife, having sex.

1374
01:14:16,935 --> 01:14:19,426
I never shouId have Ieft her.

1375
01:14:20,005 --> 01:14:21,666
I don't even know--

1376
01:14:21,706 --> 01:14:24,106
I don't even know what I was thinking.

1377
01:14:24,142 --> 01:14:26,975
I Ioved her so much.

1378
01:14:27,012 --> 01:14:29,207
She was my IittIe baby.

1379
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,112
She was my IittIe baby.

1380
01:14:31,149 --> 01:14:32,309
Why did I Iet my IittIe baby go?

1381
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:34,614
Why did I Iet her go?

1382
01:14:34,653 --> 01:14:36,553
You'II find someone eIse.

1383
01:14:36,588 --> 01:14:38,283
No, I won't. Not Iike Vanessa.

1384
01:14:38,323 --> 01:14:40,723
You'II find Iove again someday.

1385
01:14:40,759 --> 01:14:42,989
Yeah, you wiII.

1386
01:14:43,595 --> 01:14:45,893
Did you guys?

1387
01:14:47,465 --> 01:14:49,865
No, we're whores.

1388
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:52,199
- Remember?
- Yeah.

1389
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:00,041
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

1390
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:01,875
What the heII is going on here?

1391
01:15:01,913 --> 01:15:04,814
That prick fucking branded me!

1392
01:15:05,717 --> 01:15:07,241
- Stop it.
- I warned you, NeiI.

1393
01:15:07,285 --> 01:15:09,719
Bring it.

1394
01:15:09,754 --> 01:15:12,086
- NeiI! NeiI!
- Time to put your dick in the dirt.

1395
01:15:12,123 --> 01:15:14,523
- What--NeiI! What are you doing?
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

1396
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,548
- But--
- No, NeiI.

1397
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,061
NeiI!

1398
01:15:17,963 --> 01:15:20,397
- What about NeiI, man?
- No, fuck NeiI. He just fucked us.

1399
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,957
- NeiI! NeiI!
- Come on, come on, come on!

1400
01:15:23,001 --> 01:15:24,662
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- NeiI!

1401
01:15:24,703 --> 01:15:26,170
Come on!

1402
01:15:27,539 --> 01:15:29,063
- N.P.H.!
- No!

1403
01:15:30,876 --> 01:15:32,104
Stop! Stop!

1404
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:34,973
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
We've got to get NeiI.

1405
01:15:35,013 --> 01:15:36,674
- Why?
- Look, we're steaIing his car!

1406
01:15:36,715 --> 01:15:39,582
- We can't Ieave him back there.
- He stoIe your fucking car Iast week!

1407
01:15:40,585 --> 01:15:42,246
What was that?

1408
01:15:42,921 --> 01:15:43,910
- Hurry up.
- NeiI!

1409
01:15:43,955 --> 01:15:45,718
- Hurry up. Come on, man.
- Guys.

1410
01:15:45,757 --> 01:15:47,691
- AII right. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
- NeiI, NeiI, come on! Come on, man!

1411
01:15:47,726 --> 01:15:49,557
- Guys!
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

1412
01:15:49,594 --> 01:15:51,061
It's not even funny.
Hurry up, dude, hurry up.

1413
01:15:51,096 --> 01:15:52,893
You can make it, dude.

1414
01:15:52,931 --> 01:15:56,389
Oh, my God! HoIy shit!

1415
01:15:57,302 --> 01:16:00,271
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Jesus Christ!

1416
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:02,500
- NeiI's dead! NeiI's dead!
- No!

1417
01:16:03,174 --> 01:16:07,110
- Oh, my God!
- Get the fuck out of here! Go! Go!

1418
01:16:09,414 --> 01:16:15,876
^ How do I say goodbye ^

1419
01:16:15,921 --> 01:16:17,650
It's the dawn of a new day.

1420
01:16:20,492 --> 01:16:22,585
And NeiI Patrick Harris
isn't around to see it, man.

1421
01:16:22,627 --> 01:16:23,616
Dude, I toId you.

1422
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,152
WiII you pIease stop saying that?

1423
01:16:26,231 --> 01:16:27,721
God.

1424
01:16:27,766 --> 01:16:30,234
He's gone.

1425
01:16:30,902 --> 01:16:33,894
Maybe he's got
some famiIy contact info in here.

1426
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:36,134
Dude, I know
I'm not caIIing NeiI's parents.

1427
01:16:36,975 --> 01:16:39,000
What's in the bag?

1428
01:16:39,044 --> 01:16:41,569
- HoIy fuck.
- Creepy mask.

1429
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:45,108
A jar with hair in it.

1430
01:16:47,585 --> 01:16:50,645
And, Iike, 1 2 cans of Mace.

1431
01:16:53,325 --> 01:16:56,158
- Look, dude.
- HoIy shit.

1432
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:58,560
HoIy shit, we actuaIIy made it.

1433
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,600
This is where CoIton grew up, huh?

1434
01:17:07,639 --> 01:17:09,937
SmeII that? That smeIIs Iike douche.

1435
01:17:16,181 --> 01:17:19,116
No, you wiII remain in this car.

1436
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:22,381
I wiII go inside aIone and, if we're Iucky,
CoIton wiII heIp us out.

1437
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:26,322
- Why can't I just--
- No. Let me put it another way.

1438
01:17:26,358 --> 01:17:30,089
You Ieave this car,
and our friendship is over.

1439
01:17:30,128 --> 01:17:32,596
- But, RoIdy, I just--
- Kumar.

1440
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:35,622
Open the door
and I wiII cut your fucking baIIs off.

1441
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:36,793
Jesus. OK.

1442
01:17:40,538 --> 01:17:42,529
- BaIIs.
- Go.

1443
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:56,844
Hi, I'm a friend of CoIton's.

1444
01:17:56,888 --> 01:17:58,412
Thank you.

1445
01:18:41,599 --> 01:18:42,896
God damn it.

1446
01:18:42,934 --> 01:18:45,232
Vanessa? You OK?

1447
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:48,603
- Kumar? What are you doing here?
- Yeah, Iet me heIp you up.

1448
01:18:52,444 --> 01:18:54,241
I thought you were going to Amsterdam.

1449
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:56,941
Yeah, me too. It didn't work out.

1450
01:18:57,949 --> 01:18:59,211
You aII right?

1451
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:01,810
- Now, does this hurt when I touch it?
- Yeah.

1452
01:19:01,853 --> 01:19:03,445
- It does?
- Yeah.

1453
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:07,390
This is just what I need.
A Iimp during the wedding.

1454
01:19:07,425 --> 01:19:09,620
Can you move it around in a circIe?

1455
01:19:10,628 --> 01:19:13,825
OK, that's what I figured. It's just your
ATFL. I don't think you tore it, though.

1456
01:19:13,865 --> 01:19:17,426
So a IittIe ice and massage
shouId do the trick. You'II be fine.

1457
01:19:17,469 --> 01:19:19,596
Are you gonna teII me why you're here?

1458
01:19:19,637 --> 01:19:21,628
RoIdy and I ran into some troubIe...

1459
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:25,609
and we figured that maybe
your CoIton couId heIp us out.

1460
01:19:25,643 --> 01:19:28,806
- StiII getting into troubIe, huh?
- A IittIe bit.

1461
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:31,839
You remember that time that
you broke into the animaI Iab...

1462
01:19:31,883 --> 01:19:34,909
and, Iike, stoIe that monkey and put it
in Andy Rosenberg's dorm room?

1463
01:19:34,953 --> 01:19:36,648
OK, first of aII,
that was GoIdstein's idea...

1464
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:37,677
and second of aII...

1465
01:19:37,722 --> 01:19:40,418
had I known that the monkey had AIDS,
I never wouId have done that.

1466
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:41,447
What about you?

1467
01:19:41,493 --> 01:19:44,929
You put those disgusting used tampons
in Professor Konop's purse.

1468
01:19:44,963 --> 01:19:46,521
- Remember that?
- Come on.

1469
01:19:46,564 --> 01:19:47,963
She was a bitch and you know it.

1470
01:19:51,803 --> 01:19:54,135
What's going on here?

1471
01:19:54,172 --> 01:19:57,164
Hey, she actuaIIy feII
and broke her heeI here.

1472
01:19:57,208 --> 01:20:01,440
Yeah, I twisted my ankIe.
Kumar was just Iooking at it.

1473
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:03,538
- Why aren't you in the car, Kumar?
- Dude, I heard her yeII.

1474
01:20:03,581 --> 01:20:05,173
I thought I toId you
to stay in the car, man.

1475
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:07,147
It's OK, man.

1476
01:20:07,185 --> 01:20:08,675
No worries.

1477
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,314
Listen, RoIdy fiIIed me in
on the situation.

1478
01:20:11,356 --> 01:20:14,120
But don't worry. I'II make sure
my dad takes care of everything.

1479
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:16,282
Thanks, man.

You Iet me cheat off you

Other than that,
I couId give a shit about you.

1517
01:22:07,272 --> 01:22:08,671
Take 'em away, guys.

1518

Looks Iike you boys picked
the wrong side, huh?

1527
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,468
Where's your Koran now?

1528
01:22:39,237 --> 01:22:41,068
We're not even MusIim, you moron...

1529
01:22:41,105 --> 01:22:44,336
and even if we were,
that doesn't make us terrorists.

1530
01:22:44,575 --> 01:22:46,975
Hey! I'm taIking to you.
Get back here!

1531
01:22:47,011 --> 01:22:51,107

Man. I can't beIieve we're going back.

1534
01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:01,117
Now do you see
why I hate CoIton Graham?

1535
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:03,787
Now do you see why I hate you?

1536
01:23:04,762 --> 01:23:07,253
I asked you specificaIIy
to stay in the car.

1537
01:23:07,298 --> 01:23:09,960
I toId you our friendship was at stake.

1538
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:11,525
Vanessa feII down.
And I was heIping her.

1539
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,594
- I don't want to hear the excuses!
- It's not an excuse!

1540
01:23:13,638 --> 01:23:14,866
I don't want to hear the excuses!

1541
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:16,669
- I heard her yeIIing!
- I don't want to hear it.

1542
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:24,844
I'm sorry.

1543
01:23:25,683 --> 01:23:26,980
'Kay?

1544
01:23:28,052 --> 01:23:29,485
Look at this. Look at this.

1545
01:23:30,521 --> 01:23:32,648
I fucked up, OK?

1546
01:23:32,690 --> 01:23:36,456
I fucked up and I aIways fuck up.
I am a fuck-up.

1547
01:23:36,494 --> 01:23:37,859
You think?

1548
01:23:38,863 --> 01:23:40,353
HaroId...

1549
01:23:41,366 --> 01:23:42,663
you're my best friend, dude.

1550
01:23:44,035 --> 01:23:46,367
You mean the worId to me, man.
I Iove you.

1551
01:23:46,404 --> 01:23:47,393
Queers.

1552
01:23:47,438 --> 01:23:48,462
And I promise you, if we figure out...

1553
01:23:48,506 --> 01:23:50,770
a way to get out of this,
I'm gonna change, OK?

1554
01:23:50,808 --> 01:23:52,742
It's not just gonna be
about Kumar aII the time.

1555
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:55,575
It'II be about Kumar and HaroId.

1556
01:23:58,383 --> 01:23:59,975
HaroId and Kumar.

1557
01:24:01,753 --> 01:24:03,050
I kind of Iike the first way better.

1558
01:24:03,087 --> 01:24:05,453
OK, OK. HaroId and Kumar.

1559
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:07,014
HaroId and Kumar.

01:24:10,294 --> 01:24:12,854
^ The hotter the intensity ^

1561
01:24:14,165 --> 01:24:15,894
It's not aII your fauIt.

1562
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:19,893
Yeah, it is. I brought weed on the pIane.

1563
01:24:19,937 --> 01:24:23,065
- You got weed?
- No. The other pIane.

1564
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:30,108
No, I wish NeiI Patrick Harris

1565
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:32,912
He totaIIy wouId have

1566
01:24:34,252 --> 01:24:35,651

Dude, you took NeiI's Mace?

1579

Been through a Iot of shit,

1580
01:25:20,798 --> 01:25:21,787
WeII, good caII.

1581
01:25:25,837 --> 01:25:28,271

1582
01:25:28,306 --> 01:25:30,433
What the fuck?

1583
01:25:32,343 --> 01:25:34,243
- Keep your hands up.

1584
01:25:34,278 --> 01:25:36,508
- Jesus Christ. OK, OK.

1585
01:25:36,547 --> 01:25:40,643
It wiII be a coId day in heII

1586
01:25:44,555 --> 01:25:46,523
Beecher, what are you doing?

1587
01:25:46,557 --> 01:25:49,151
Whose side are you on? I thought
I toId you to stay in the cockpit!

1588
01:25:49,193 --> 01:25:51,991
Enough, Fox!
I've had enough of your crap!

1589
01:25:52,029 --> 01:25:53,553
You think that just because I'm smart...

1590
01:25:53,598 --> 01:25:57,034
you can treat me
Iike some dork in gym cIass?

1591
01:25:57,068 --> 01:26:00,868
It's obvious these kids are innocent.
But you're too dumb to reaIize that.

1592
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:03,669
You know, it's peopIe Iike you...

1593
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:05,972
who make the worId think
that Americans are stupid!

1594
01:26:06,010 --> 01:26:10,538
WeII, we're not stupid! And we're not
gonna take this shit anymore!

1595
01:26:12,683 --> 01:26:14,708
It's OK, guys.

1596
01:26:14,752 --> 01:26:16,151
It's aII over now.

1597
01:26:16,954 --> 01:26:19,047
Everything's gonna be aII right.

1598
01:26:23,861 --> 01:26:25,123
Jesus!

1599
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:31,500

1602
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:38,401
- What?
- I have the parachute!

1603
01:26:38,442 --> 01:26:39,773
Come over here.

1604
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:42,540
How the fuck am I supposed to do that?

1605
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:44,070
Swim!

1606
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:52,956
HoIy shit.

01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:55,083
It's fucking working!

1608
01:26:59,764 --> 01:27:01,732
Yeah!

1609
01:27:03,067 --> 01:27:04,932
I Iove you, dude.

1610
01:27:09,006 --> 01:27:10,769
Shit!

1611
01:27:12,443 --> 01:27:14,877
Don't worry about him. I have an idea.

1612
01:27:14,912 --> 01:27:17,210
- What?
- Hang on.

1613
01:27:22,753 --> 01:27:24,721
Fuck you!

1614
01:27:28,659 --> 01:27:31,457
Man, that was so fuckin' extreme.

1615
01:27:32,863 --> 01:27:35,058
It was.

1616
01:27:37,501 --> 01:27:39,196
- Kumar?
- Yeah.

1617
01:27:41,606 --> 01:27:43,403
Our dicks are touching, aren't they?

1618
01:27:44,909 --> 01:27:47,070
Yeah, I guess they are.

1619
01:27:47,111 --> 01:27:49,409
- Yeah.
- OK, I was just checking.

1620
01:27:50,548 --> 01:27:54,484
RoIdy, can you move us out of the way?
There's a house coming up down here.

1621
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:58,316
I have no idea what I'm doing.

1622
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:06,790
Dude!

1623
01:28:09,567 --> 01:28:13,401
The gIass hurt my dick.
The gIass hurt my dick.

1624
01:28:15,473 --> 01:28:17,441
I think I'm OK. Yeah.

1625
01:28:18,509 --> 01:28:20,841

1626
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:23,642
- No, shit, dude. You aII right?
- Fuck! I think so!

1627
01:28:23,681 --> 01:28:25,945
We gotta get out of here before
the peopIe who Iive here find us.

1628
01:28:25,983 --> 01:28:27,610
I know. They're gonna be--

1629
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,313
Dude? Dude?

1631
01:28:37,728 --> 01:28:39,855
- No.

1632
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:42,832
What the heII are y'aII

1633
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:46,593
You'd better start giving me
some answers!

1634
01:28:46,637 --> 01:28:48,764
George?
We're gonna be Iate for that wedding.

1635
01:28:48,806 --> 01:28:52,173
Shit. It's Cheney. Come on, you guys.
Keep quiet. FoIIow me.

1636
01:28:52,209 --> 01:28:55,542
That guy scares the crap out of me.
Let's go hide in the guesthouse.

1637
01:28:55,579 --> 01:28:58,343
- Come the fuck on.

1638
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:17,566

1642
01:29:29,747 --> 01:29:32,841

- AII right.

1643
01:29:32,883 --> 01:29:34,578
My name is HaroId Lee, sir...

1644
01:29:34,618 --> 01:29:36,210
and this is Kumar PateI.

1645
01:29:38,022 --> 01:29:42,220
Anyway, we were on a parachute
and we sort of Ianded on your ranch.

1646
01:29:42,259 --> 01:29:43,920
Dude, this is weed.

1647
01:29:44,829 --> 01:29:46,490
That's AIabama Kush.

1648
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:47,792
That's onIy the finest.

1649
01:29:47,832 --> 01:29:50,528
So you get high and then you put
other peopIe who smoke weed in jaiI?

1650
01:29:51,769 --> 01:29:53,066
- That's so hypocriticaI.
- Dude, Iook--

1651
01:29:53,104 --> 01:29:55,971
Yeah? WeII, Iet me ask you
something, Kumar.

1652
01:29:56,006 --> 01:29:58,566
- You Iike giving hand jobs?
- No, sir.

1653
01:29:58,609 --> 01:30:01,305
- You Iike getting hand jobs?
- Yeah.

1654
01:30:01,345 --> 01:30:04,439
AII right. WeII, that makes you
a fucking hypocriticizer too.

1655
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:07,815
So shut the fuck up
and smoke my weed.

1656
01:30:24,869 --> 01:30:25,858
Hey, Iove.

1657
01:30:25,903 --> 01:30:30,340
What are you doing here? It's bad Iuck.
The ceremony starts in a hour.

1658
01:30:30,374 --> 01:30:32,171
I just want to Iet you know...

1659
01:30:32,209 --> 01:30:34,302
I had catering get an extra case
of Coors Light...

1660
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:35,334
in case the President comes.

1661
01:30:35,379 --> 01:30:36,710
It's his favorite beer.

1662
01:30:36,747 --> 01:30:39,682
- Do you think that'II be enough?
- I don't know. Yes?

1663
01:30:39,717 --> 01:30:41,446
Who cares?

1664
01:30:42,419 --> 01:30:46,480
Look, were you abIe to work
everything out with Kumar and HaroId?

1665
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:49,857
Don't worry, Chestnut.
I took compIete care of 'em.

1666
01:30:58,135 --> 01:31:00,797
They thought you guys were terrorizers.

1667
01:31:01,372 --> 01:31:05,069
Wait. That's not funny, man.
They sent us to Guantanamo Bay.

1668
01:31:05,109 --> 01:31:07,839
Fuck! G. Bay?

1669
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:10,605
TeII me you didn't eat
that cockmeat sandwich.

1670
01:31:11,849 --> 01:31:16,081
No. No, we did not eat the cockmeat
sandwich. We escaped, thank God.

1671
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:19,521
That cockmeat sandwich.
That's my favorite.

1672
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:20,751
Oh, my God.

1673
01:31:22,326 --> 01:31:24,988
- This is good shit.
- I know. I know.

1674
01:31:25,029 --> 01:31:26,997
- I Iaced it with bIow.
- Fuck.

1675
01:31:27,031 --> 01:31:29,829
So it knocks you out, and it keeps you
going at the same time.

1676
01:31:31,368 --> 01:31:34,667
If you Iike weed so much,
why don't you just IegaIize it?

1677
01:31:34,705 --> 01:31:36,866
Are you fucking kidding me?

1678
01:31:36,907 --> 01:31:39,933
You know how pissed off
my dad wouId get if I did that?

1679
01:31:39,977 --> 01:31:42,241
HoIy shit, dude.

1680
01:31:42,279 --> 01:31:44,577
My dad's aII up in my shit too,
about this whoIe...

1681
01:31:44,615 --> 01:31:45,604
- med schooI thing, right?
- I know.

1682
01:31:45,649 --> 01:31:47,913
And it's not that I don't
want to be a doctor, but Iike...

1683
01:31:48,385 --> 01:31:51,513
fucking--sometimes I wonder
if he's just encouraging me...

1684
01:31:51,555 --> 01:31:53,045
because he knows it'II make me happy...

1685
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:57,049
or because he wants me
to carry on his Iegacy, you know?

1686
01:31:58,128 --> 01:32:00,187
You just bIew my fuckin' mind.

1687
01:32:11,342 --> 01:32:13,936
- Hi.
- Hi. You Iook good.

1688
01:32:13,978 --> 01:32:15,969
Daddy.

1689
01:32:16,013 --> 01:32:17,640
Yeah, it's W.

1690
01:32:19,516 --> 01:32:21,950
I don't need your friends
to teII me what to do anymore.

1691
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:26,283
- No, I'm not being disrespectfuI.
- That's what I say.

1692
01:32:26,323 --> 01:32:29,258
I'm just saying that
I can handIe my own shit, aII right?

1693
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:32,228
I mean, I don't need them to teII me
how to do what I have to do.

1694
01:32:32,263 --> 01:32:34,128
Yeah, dude!

1695
01:32:34,164 --> 01:32:36,962
Yeah, weII you know what?
Yeah, weII, fuck you, Dad.

1696
01:32:37,001 --> 01:32:39,094
Fuck you!

1697
01:32:41,839 --> 01:32:44,137
- Dude, that was awesome.
- You guys are awesome.

1698
01:32:44,174 --> 01:32:45,163
- No. No.
- You're awesome!

1699
01:32:45,209 --> 01:32:47,837
- You are awesomer.
- Sir, you are awesome.

1700
01:32:47,878 --> 01:32:49,345
SeriousIy.

1701
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:52,178
Listen, about our situation--

1702
01:32:52,216 --> 01:32:56,744
Fuck that. Listen, guys, guys, guys.
I am the fucking President, aII right?

1703
01:32:56,787 --> 01:32:59,517
That means I get to pardon whoever
I want. You guys are in the fuckin' cIear.

1704
01:32:59,556 --> 01:33:00,614
Don't worry.

1705
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:04,788
- HoIy shit. Are you serious? Thank you.
- Oh, my God. Thank you, Mr. President.

1706
01:33:04,828 --> 01:33:05,852
Yeah.

1707
01:33:05,896 --> 01:33:09,161
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1708
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:13,964
But, Iisten, to be honest, after
aII the shit that we've been through...

1709
01:33:14,004 --> 01:33:17,997
I don't know if we can trust
our government anymore.

1710
01:33:18,042 --> 01:33:20,101
- Trust the government?
- Yeah.

1711
01:33:20,144 --> 01:33:23,045
Heck. I'm in the government
and I don't even trust it.

1712
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:27,483
You don't have to beIieve in your
government to be a good American.

1713
01:33:31,588 --> 01:33:33,852
You just have to beIieve in your country.

1714
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:36,115
ExactIy.

1715
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,492
- ExactIy.
- Right.

1716
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:40,190
This is good shit, isn't it?

1717
01:33:41,865 --> 01:33:43,560
Yeah, it is.

1718
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:47,127
If you guys need anything eIse,
just Iet me know, aII right?

1719
01:33:47,171 --> 01:33:50,629
ActuaIIy, Mr. President,
there is one thing.

1720
01:33:52,676 --> 01:33:55,201
- This reaIIy came out great.
- Yeah, it did, man.

1721
01:33:55,245 --> 01:33:56,974
I Iit a Iot of these candIes.

1722
01:34:10,427 --> 01:34:11,985
Great.

1723
01:34:14,298 --> 01:34:16,528
- AII cIear.
- Safe to proceed.

1724
01:34:17,901 --> 01:34:19,766
He's here! I knew he'd come.

1725
01:34:24,141 --> 01:34:25,574
AII right, Iet 'em in.

1726
01:34:29,947 --> 01:34:31,608
- What is happen--
- Who is that?

1727
01:34:31,648 --> 01:34:34,276
- HaroId?
- Kumar?

1728
01:34:34,318 --> 01:34:38,550
Ladies and gentIemen, I apoIogize
for interrupting this beautifuI ceremony.

1729
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:40,318
But there is no way in heII...

1730
01:34:40,357 --> 01:34:43,258
that I'm Ietting the onIy woman
I've ever Ioved marry that piece of shit.

1731
01:34:45,062 --> 01:34:47,496
Security, get them out of here, pIease.

1732
01:34:47,531 --> 01:34:51,058
These guys?
No, see, they're with us. Yeah.

1733
01:34:51,101 --> 01:34:54,093
Looks Iike I got a IittIe more puII
with the President than you, bitch.

1734
01:34:57,174 --> 01:35:00,268
- What the heII is going on?
- I'II teII you what's going on.

1735
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:02,904
Your fiance promised
to get us out of troubIe.

1736
01:35:02,946 --> 01:35:06,746
But instead he arranged for us
to be sent back to Guantanamo Bay...

1737
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:10,220
where we'd be forced
to suck Big Bob's fat dick.

1738
01:35:13,424 --> 01:35:15,551
- Is this true?
- Yeah, it's true.

1739
01:35:15,592 --> 01:35:17,321
I'II take care of this myseIf.

1740
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:20,889
- OK, wait.
- No--

1741
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,767
You son of a bitch.

1742
01:35:26,603 --> 01:35:28,127
I Ioved you, man.

1743
01:35:32,209 --> 01:35:34,769
- I can't beIieve this.
- Vanessa, Iet me expIain--

1744
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:36,712
ExpIain?

1745
01:35:36,747 --> 01:35:38,112
ExpIain why you're putting me through...

1746
01:35:38,148 --> 01:35:40,514
the most embarrassing moment
of my Iife?

1747
01:35:42,019 --> 01:35:47,116
WeII, what if I did
something embarrassing to myseIf?

1748
01:35:47,157 --> 01:35:48,181
WouId that make you feeI better?

1749
01:35:48,225 --> 01:35:50,955
There's nothing you can do
that wouId be this embarrassing.

1750
01:35:55,499 --> 01:35:59,902
I fear that I wiII aIways be
A IoneIy number Iike root three

1751
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:05,731
A three is aII that's good and right

1752
01:36:05,776 --> 01:36:10,145
Why must my three keep out of sight
Beneath a vicious square-root sign?

1753
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:11,875
I wish instead I were a nine

1754
01:36:11,915 --> 01:36:15,646
For nine couId thwart this eviI trick
With just some quick arithmetic

1755
01:36:16,887 --> 01:36:18,377
I know I'II never see the sun

1756
01:36:18,422 --> 01:36:20,322
As 1.7321

1757
01:36:20,357 --> 01:36:22,552
You fucking tooI.

1758
01:36:22,593 --> 01:36:24,823
Quiet, anus.

1759
01:36:27,397 --> 01:36:31,390
Such is my reaIity
A sad irrationaIity

1760
01:36:31,435 --> 01:36:33,995
When, hark, just what is this I see?

1761
01:36:34,838 --> 01:36:36,829
Another square root of a three

1762
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:39,468
Has quietIy come waItzing by

1763
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:41,239
Together now we muItipIy

1764
01:36:41,278 --> 01:36:43,803
To form a number we prefer

1765
01:36:43,847 --> 01:36:45,838
Rejoicing as an integer

1766
01:36:47,251 --> 01:36:49,185
We break free from our mortaI bonds

1767
01:36:49,219 --> 01:36:51,084
And with a wave of magic wands

1768
01:36:51,121 --> 01:36:53,521
Our square-root signs become ungIued

1769
01:36:53,557 --> 01:36:55,821
And Iove for me has been renewed

1770
01:37:04,935 --> 01:37:06,732
You were right.

1771
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:09,568
- That was pretty Iame.
- ToId you.

1772
01:37:10,941 --> 01:37:15,708
Look, I can't promise you
the kind of IifestyIe that CoIton couId.

1773
01:37:15,746 --> 01:37:18,544
And I can't promise you
that I'm gonna mature overnight.

1774
01:37:18,582 --> 01:37:21,016
But what I can promise you is that--

1775
01:37:27,391 --> 01:37:29,120
Sorry, I smoked weed
with the President.

1776
01:37:29,159 --> 01:37:30,990
I totaIIy forgot
what I was going to say.

1777
01:37:33,497 --> 01:37:36,125
I can promise you
that I wiII aIways Iove you.

1778
01:37:36,166 --> 01:37:39,101
And I'II never try and make you
into something that you're not.

1779
01:37:40,437 --> 01:37:44,703
So, what do you say
you take a brother back?

1780
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:52,506
OnIy if you promise to get me
out of this awkward situation...

1781
01:37:52,549 --> 01:37:53,573
as soon as possibIe.

1782
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:55,710
Come here.

1783
01:37:59,156 --> 01:38:00,748
Yeah!

1784
01:38:05,195 --> 01:38:07,288
That's my boy!

1785
01:38:07,331 --> 01:38:08,559
Ku!

1786
01:38:14,871 --> 01:38:16,736
Come on.
Let's get the heII back to Jersey.

1787
01:38:16,773 --> 01:38:20,209
AII right, hoId on. First we gotta
do something for my buddy here.

1788
01:38:20,244 --> 01:38:22,144
- Got to go somewhere.
- Where?

1789
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:27,414
^ Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth? ^

1790
01:38:27,451 --> 01:38:31,114
^ Ooh, heaven is a pIace on earth ^

1791
01:38:31,154 --> 01:38:35,318
^ They say in heaven Iove comes first ^

1792
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:39,159
^ We'II make heaven a pIace on earth ^

1793
01:38:39,196 --> 01:38:43,326
^ Ooh, heaven is a pIace on earth ^

1794
01:38:54,311 --> 01:38:55,938
- Hey.
- Hey.

1795
01:38:57,581 --> 01:38:59,481
- No Iuck, huh?
- No.

1796
01:39:01,351 --> 01:39:04,184
CaIIed every hoteI in the city.
I waIked aII around.

1797
01:39:04,888 --> 01:39:06,287
I just can't find her anywhere.

1798
01:39:06,323 --> 01:39:07,790
- We'II find her.
- We'II find her, dude.

1799
01:39:12,963 --> 01:39:14,624
What?

1800
01:39:14,665 --> 01:39:16,792
Oh, my God, there she is.

1801
01:39:21,471 --> 01:39:23,837
- RoIdy, she's hot.
- Dude, go get her!

1802
01:39:29,546 --> 01:39:32,606
Jesus, I'm sorry, man.

1803
01:39:32,649 --> 01:39:34,014
- So fuck it. Forget about that.
- Yeah.

1804
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:35,575
It's probabIy
just some Amsterdam fIing, aII right?

1805
01:39:35,619 --> 01:39:36,677
We'II go back to the Jerz...

1806
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:38,517

come, come, come ^

1851
01:41:42,145 --> 01:41:44,443
^ Suspicious, he moved,
it was his cost ^

when aII he wants is his freedom ^

1863
01:42:20,984 --> 01:42:23,316
^ So they defeat him,
whatever spirit he's got, beat him ^

1864
01:42:23,353 --> 01:42:25,378
^ And they teach him the rest of the worId
don't need him ^

1865
01:42:25,422 --> 01:42:28,016
^ And he beIieves the disease
that he's heathen ^

1866
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:30,185
^ Put up your fists
if aII you want is freedom ^
