00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:04,834
A poster from this house's production

00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:08,254

00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:11,382
Five, then. Five I am bid. Six.

6
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,302
Seven. Against you, sir, seven.

7
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:15,803

Sold, to Monsieur Deferre.

9
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,144
Thank you very much, sir.

10
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:27,523
Lot 664, a wooden pistol
and three human skulls ...

11
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:31,319
from the 1831 production
of "Robert le Diable" by Meyerbeer.

12
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:35,239
Ten francs for this.
Ten, thank you. Ten still.

13
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:38,326
Fifteen, thank you. Fifteen I'm bid.

14
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,745
Going at 15.

15
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,081
Your number, sir?

16
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:46,959
Lot 665, ladies and gentlemen ...

17
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:51,297
a papier-mâché musical box
in the shape of a barrel organ.

18
00:02:51,465 --> 00:02:57,345
Attached, the figure of a monkey
in Persian robes playing the cymbals.

19
00:02:57,512 --> 00:03:01,891
This item discovered in the vaults
of the theater, still in working order.

20
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:04,185
Showing here.

21
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:15,154
May I commence at 15 francs?

22
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:16,906
Fifteen, thank you.

23
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:19,617
Yes, 20 from you, sir.
Thank you very much.

24
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:25,539
Madame Giry, 25. Thank you, Madame.
Twenty-five I'm bid. Do I hear 30?

25
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:29,377
Thirty. And 35?

26
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:37,635
Selling at 30 francs, then.
Thirty once, 30 twice ...

27
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:42,139
Sold for 30 francs
to the Vicomte de Chagny.

28
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:43,307
Thank you, sir.

29
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:52,233
A collector's piece indeed

30
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:55,319
Every detail

31
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:58,364
Exactly as she said

32
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:06,372
Will you still play
When all the rest of us are dead?

33
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:10,376
Lot 666, then.

34
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:13,546
A chandelier in pieces.

35
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:20,177
Some of you may recall the strange affair
of the Phantom of the Opera.

36
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:23,597
A mystery never fully explained.

37
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:28,769
We're told, ladies and gentlemen,
that this is the very chandelier ...

38
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:32,440
which figures in the famous disaster.

39
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:38,195
Our workshops have repaired it and wired
parts of it for the new electric light.

40
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:44,118
Perhaps we can frighten away
the ghost of so many years ago ...

41
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:46,871
with a little illumination.

42
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,041
Gentlemen?

43
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:46,050
The trophy
From our saviors

44
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:53,807
From our saviors

45
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:58,979
From the enslaving force

46
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:02,816
Of Rome!

47
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:05,611
Madame.

48
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,988
With feasting and dancing and song

49
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:13,827
Tonight in celebration
We greet the victorious throng

50
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:17,081
Returned to bring salvation!

51
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:23,921
I've got them, monsieur.

52
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:27,925
Vicomte, welcome.

53
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:31,637
The trumpets of Carthage resound

54
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:35,057
Hear, Romans, now and tremble

55
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:37,518
Hark to our step on the ground

56
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:41,272
Hear the drums
Hannibal comes!

57
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:44,191
You make my dress train too long.

58
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:53,492
Sad to return
To find the land we love

59
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,913
Threatened once more
By Roma's far-reaching grasp

60
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,790
Gentlemen, gentlemen --

61
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,752
Rehearsals are under way for a new
production of Chalumeau's Hannibal.

62
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,549
- Monsieur Lefevre, I am rehearsing.
- Monsieur Reyer, Madame Giry ...

63
00:09:08,717 --> 00:09:12,177
ladies and gentlemen, please,
if I could have your attention?

64
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:15,889
As you know, there have been rumors
of my imminent retirement.

65
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:21,228
I can now tell you that these were all true,
and it is my pleasure to introduce you ...

66
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:24,523
to the two gentlemen who now own
the Opera Populaire ...

67
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:28,611
Monsieur Richard Firmin
and Monsieur Gilles Andre.

68
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:33,282
I'm sure you have read of their recent
fortune in the junk business.

69
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,243
Scrap metal, actually.

70
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:38,621
They must be rich.

71
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:43,584
And we are deeply honored
to introduce our new patron.

72
00:09:43,752 --> 00:09:46,545
The Vicomte de Chagny.

73
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:51,008
I still can't believe we managed to get him.
It's such a coup for us, my dear.

74
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:52,968
It's Raoul.

75
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,558
Before my father died,
at the house by the sea ...

76
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:03,854
I guess you could say we were
childhood sweethearts.

77
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:07,399
- He called me Little Lotte.
- Christine, he's so handsome.

78
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:11,278
My parents and I are honored
to support all the arts ...

79
00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:14,740
especially the world-renowned
Opera Populaire.

80
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:20,954
Gentlemen, Signora Carlotta Giudicelli,
our leading soprano for five seasons.

81
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:22,831
- Brava! Brava!
- Brava! Brava!

82
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,876
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.

83
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:33,842
An honor, signor. I believe
I'm keeping you from your rehearsal.

84
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,930
I will be here this evening to share
your great triumph. My apologies.

85
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:39,598
Thank you, monsieur.

86
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:43,977
- Once more if you please, signor.
- He love me. He love me.

87
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:48,565
Thank you, indeed, for the wonderful
words. So inspiring and encouraging ...

88
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:51,819
He wouldn't recognize me.

89
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,655
- He didn't see you.
- If you please. Monsieur.

90
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,870
We take particular pride
in the excellence of our ballet.

91
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,539
I see why.

92
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:06,166
Especially that little blond angel.

93
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,919
My daughter, Meg Giry.

94
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:13,757
And that exceptional beauty.
No relation, I trust?

95
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,803
Christine Daae.
Promising talent, Monsieur Firmin.

96
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:20,723
Very promising.

97
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,391
Daae, did you say?

98
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,853
No relation to the famous
Swedish violinist?

99
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:27,688
His only child.

100
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:31,859
Orphaned at 7 when she came
to live and train in the ballet dormitories.

101
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:34,278
An orphan, you say?

102
00:11:34,446 --> 00:11:36,280
I think of her as a daughter also.

103
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:40,451
Gentlemen, if you would kindly
stand to one side.

104
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,996
Hannibal's friends!

105
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:47,291
Ah, me! Not on my dress! Why?

106
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:59,595
The trumpeting elephants sound

107
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:03,223
Hear, Romans, now and tremble

108
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:06,143
Hark to their step on the ground

109
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:09,229
Hear the drums!

110
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:18,363
Hannibal comes!

111
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,663
All day!

112
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,458
All they want is the dancing!

113
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:32,878
Well, the Vicomte is very excited
about tonight's gala.

114
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:42,262
I hope he is as excited by dancing girls
as your new managers ...

115
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,516
because I will not be singing!

116
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,855
Get my doggy, bring my doggy. 
Bye-bye.

117
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:54,066
- What do we do?
- Grovel.

118
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:55,818
- Grovel, grovel.
- Right.

119
00:12:55,985 --> 00:13:00,364
- I'm going now. It is finished.
- World-renowned artist and great beauty.

120
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:04,076
Bella diva.

121
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:05,786
Goddess of song.

122
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:09,998
Monsieur Reyer, isn't there
a rather marvelous aria for Elissa ...

123
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,126
in Act 3 of Hannibal?
Perhaps the signora --

124
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:19,383
Because I have not my costume for
Act 3. Because somebody not finish it!

125
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:21,969
And I hate my hat!

126
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:26,598
Signora, as a personal favor, would you
oblige us with a private rendition?

127
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:30,394
Unless, of course,
Monsieur Reyer objects.

128
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:41,071
If my managers command.

129
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:46,785
- Monsieur Reyer?
- If my diva commands.

130
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:48,787
Yes, I do.

131
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:50,664
Everybody, very quiet.

132
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:53,542
- Monsieur, why exactly are you retiring?
- My health.

133
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:56,211
- I see.
- You as well!

134
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:01,633
Signora.

135
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:03,760
Maestro.

136
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:14,104
Think of me
Think of me fondly

137
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:21,528
When we've said goodbye

138
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:27,075
Remember me once in a while

139
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:34,917
Please promise me you'll try

140
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:42,799
When you find that once again
You long to take your heart back

141
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,718
And be free --

142
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:53,644
- Oh, my God, signora!
- I hate you.

143
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:57,230
- Lift it up!
- He's here. The Phantom of the Opera.

144
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:01,443
Signora, are you all right? Buquet!
For God's sake, what's going on up there?

145
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:06,990
Please, monsieur, don't look at me.
As God's my judge, I wasn't at my post.

146
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:09,701
Please, monsieur, there's no one there.

147
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:14,748
Or if there is, well, then,
it must be a ghost.

148
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:23,256
Signora, these things do happen.

149
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:26,593
For the past three years
these things do happen.

150
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,554
And did you stop them
from happening? No!

151
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:32,224
And you two, you are as bad as him.

152
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:35,018
"These things do happen."

153
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:40,732
Until you stop these things from happening,
this thing does not happen!

154
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:46,405
- Bring my doggy and my boxy.
- Amateurs.

155
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:50,409
Now you see.
Bye-bye, I'm really leaving.

156
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:55,914
Gentlemen, good luck.
If you need me, I shall be in Australia.

157
00:15:58,084 --> 00:16:02,546
Signora Giudicelli, she will be
coming back, won't she?

158
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:04,798
You think so, monsieur?

159
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:10,470
- I have a message from the Opera Ghost.
- Oh, God in heaven, you're all obsessed!

160
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:13,974
- He welcomes you to his opera house.
- His opera house?

161
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:18,395
And commands that you continue
to leave box five empty ...

162
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:22,107
for his use. And reminds you
that his salary is due.

163
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:23,734
His salary?

164
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:27,571
Well, Monsieur Lefevre used to give him
20,000 francs a month.

165
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:30,741
Twenty thousand francs?

166
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:34,703
Perhaps you can afford more.
With the vicomte as your patron?

167
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:38,540
Madame, I had hoped to make
that announcement public tonight ...

168
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,209
when the vicomte was to join us
for the gala.

169
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:46,590
Obviously, we shall now have to cancel,
as it appears we have lost our star!

170
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:53,597
- But surely there must be an understudy.
- There is no understudy for La Carlotta!

171
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:57,976
A full house, Andre.
We shall have to refund a full house!

172
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:00,771
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.

173
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:03,648
What, a chorus girl? Don't be silly.

174
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:07,027
She has been taking lessons
from a great teacher.

175
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:11,573
- Who?
- I don't know his name, monsieur.

176
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,868
Let her sing for you, monsieur.

177
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:17,245
She has been well taught.

178
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,873
All right.

179
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,043
Come on, don't be shy.

180
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:25,962
Come on, come along. Just ...

181
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,258
From the beginning of the aria then,
please, mademoiselle.

182
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:35,138
- Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
- She's very pretty.

183
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:39,726
Think of me
Think of me fondly

184
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:44,106
When we've said goodbye

185
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:48,735
Remember me once in a while

186
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:53,615
Please promise me you'll try

187
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:57,410
When you find
That once again you long

188
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:01,998
To take your heart back
And be free

189
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:07,420
If you ever find a moment

190
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:14,177
Spare a thought for me

191
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:34,906
We never said our love was evergreen

192
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:38,785
Or as unchanging as the sea

193
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,875
But if you can still remember

194
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:50,380
Stop and think of me

195
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:58,972
Think of all the things
We've shared and seen

196
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,059
Don't think about the way

197
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:08,523
Things might have been

198
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:13,820
Think of me, think of me waking

199
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:17,949
Silent and resigned

200
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:22,871
Imagine me, trying too hard

201
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,958
To put you from my mind

202
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:31,046
Recall those days
Look back on all those times

203
00:19:31,214 --> 00:19:35,675
Think of the things we'll never do

204
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:40,180
There will never be a day

205
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:48,813
When I won't think of you

206
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:55,946
Can it be?

207
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:58,865
Can it be Christine?

208
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:01,660
Bravo!

209
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:07,040
Long ago
It seems so long ago

210
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:11,127
How young and innocent we were

211
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:15,590
She may not remember me

212
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:21,554
But I remember her

213
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:24,849
Flowers fade
The fruits of summer fade

214
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:29,562
They have their seasons
So do we

215
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:35,068
But please promise me
That sometimes

216
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:40,907
You will think

217
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:07,058
Of me

218
00:21:25,995 --> 00:21:38,089
Brava!

219
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:49,494
Brava, brava, bravissima

220
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:54,082
Christine, Christine

221
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:57,377
Christine

222
00:22:57,545 --> 00:23:03,425
Where in the world
Have you been hiding?

223
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:08,054
Really, you were perfect

224
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,561
I only wish
I knew your secret

225
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:19,816
Who is your great tutor?

226
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:22,193
Meg ...

227
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:25,989
when your mother
brought me here to live ...

228
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:30,118
whenever I'd come down here alone ...

229
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:33,455
to light a candle for my father ...

230
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:37,792
a voice, from above ...

231
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:43,214
and in my dreams,
he was always there.

232
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:47,177
You see ...

233
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:50,638
when my father lay dying ...

234
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:54,851
he told me I would be protected
by an angel.

235
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,230
An angel of music.

236
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:04,027
Christine, do you believe?

237
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:07,363
Do you think the spirit of your
father's coaching you?

238
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,867
Who else, Meg? Who?

239
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:19,292
Father once spoke of an angel

240
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,923
I used to dream he'd appear

241
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:29,802
Now as I sing
I can sense him

242
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:35,892
And I know he's here

243
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:41,272
Here in this room
He calls me softly

244
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,152
Somewhere inside hiding

245
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,074
Somehow I know
He's always with me

246
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:55,954
He, the unseen genius

247
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:00,291
Christine, you must have been dreaming

248
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:05,213
Stories like this Can't Come true

249
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,676
Christine, you're talking in riddles

250
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:15,223
And it's not like you

251
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,521
Angel of Music
Guide and guardian

252
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:27,360
- Grant to me your glory
- Who is this angel?

253
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:33,283
- This Angel of Music, hide no longer
- This Angel of Music, hide no longer

254
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:39,247
- Secret and strange angel
- Secret and strange angel

255
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:42,333
He's with me even now

256
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:45,378
- Your hands are cold
- All around me

257
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:48,256
Your face, Christine, it's white

258
00:25:48,424 --> 00:25:54,095
- It frightens me
- Don't be frightened

259
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:07,275
No.

260
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:13,281
You did very well, my dear.

261
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,453
He is pleased with you.

262
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:30,882
- Vicomte.
- Vicomte.

263
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,343
We've made quite a discovery
with Miss Daae.

264
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,179
Perhaps we could present her
to you, dear vicomte?

265
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:41,184
If you wouldn't mind, this is one visit
I should prefer to make unaccompanied.

266
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:43,478
Thank you.

267
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:47,398
It would appear they've met before.

268
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:54,822
Little Lotte let her mind wander.

269
00:26:56,283 --> 00:27:01,287
Little Lotte thought, "Am I fonder
of dolls or of goblins or shoes?"

270
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:05,124
- Raoul.
- "Or of riddles or frocks?"

271
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:09,212
- Those picnics in the attic.
- "Or of chocolates?"

272
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:14,008
- Father playing the violin.
- As we read to each other ...

273
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:16,761
dark stories of the North.
- No.

274
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:21,849
"What I love best," Lotte said,
"is when I'm asleep in my bed."

275
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:27,397
And the Angel of Music
Sings songs in my head

276
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:34,821
The Angel of Music
Sings songs in my head

277
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,867
You sang like an angel tonight.

278
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,247
Father said:

279
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:49,335
"When I'm in heaven, child, I will
send the Angel of Music to you."

280
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:53,214
Well, father is dead, Raoul.

281
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:55,925
And I have been visited
by the Angel of Music.

282
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:58,010
No doubt of it.

283
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:00,638
And now we go to supper.

284
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:02,557
No, Raoul.

285
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:06,436
- The Angel of Music is very strict.
- Well, I shan't keep you up late.

286
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,312
Raoul, no.

287
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,150
You must change.
I'll order my carriage, Little Lotte.

288
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,402
No. Raoul, wait!

289
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:11,667
Insolent boy, this slave of fashion

290
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:16,255
Basking in your glory

291
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:21,385
Ignorant fool, this brave young suitor

292
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:26,432
Sharing in my triumph

293
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,896
Angel, I hear you
Speak, I listen

294
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:37,360
Stay by my side
Guide me

295
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:42,323
Angel, my soul was weak
Forgive me

296
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:47,286
Enter at last, master

297
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:52,333
Flattering child, you shall know me

298
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:57,463
See why in shadow I hide

299
00:29:57,923 --> 00:30:02,260
Look at your face in the mirror

300
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:08,683
I am there inside!

301
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:14,188
Angel of Music, guide and guardian

302
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:20,486
Grant to me your glory

303
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:26,158
Angel of Music, hide no longer

304
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:32,373
Come to me, strange angel

305
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:38,170
I am your Angel of Music

306
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:43,217
Come to me, Angel of Music

307
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:47,013
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?

308
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:52,393
- I am your Angel of Music
- Christine. Christine!

309
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:57,440
Come to me, Angel of Music

310
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:27,053
In sleep he sang to me

311
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,140
In dreams he came

312
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:35,061
That voice which calls to me

313
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:39,065
And speaks my name

314
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:43,110
And do I dream again?

315
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,074
For now I find

316
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:55,122
The Phantom of the Opera is there

317
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:59,919
Inside my mind

318
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:11,138
Sing once again with me

319
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:14,850
Our strange duet

320
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:19,105
My power over you

321
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:23,109
Grows stronger yet

322
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:26,904
And though you turn from me

323
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:31,909
To glance behind

324
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:39,208
The Phantom of the Opera is there

325
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:43,421
Inside your mind

326
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:55,182
Those who have seen your face

327
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,145
Draw back in fear

328
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:03,232
I am the mask you wear

329
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,986
It's me they hear

330
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:11,157
- Your spirit and my voice
- My spirit and your voice

331
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:16,162
- In one combined
- In one combined

332
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:23,210
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- The Phantom of the Opera is there

333
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:28,632
- Inside my mind
- Inside your mind

334
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:40,352
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera

335
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:50,529
Sing, my Angel of Music.

336
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:59,538
Sing, my angel.

337
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:05,044
Sing for me!

338
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:18,849
Sing, my angel.

339
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:24,939
Sing for me!

340
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:39,829
I have brought you

341
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:44,667
To the seat of sweet music's throne

342
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:51,465
To this kingdom where all must
Pay homage to music

343
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:59,557
Music, you have come here

344
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:04,353
For one purpose, and one alone

345
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:09,024
Since the moment
I first heard you sing

346
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:14,280
I have needed you with me
To serve me, to sing

347
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:17,867
For my music

348
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:23,873
My music

349
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:35,634
Night-time sharpens

350
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:40,347
Heightens each sensation

351
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:45,352
Darkness stirs

352
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,816
And wakes imagination

353
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:55,821
Silently the senses

354
00:35:55,989 --> 00:36:01,160
Abandon their defenses

355
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:18,093
Slowly, gently

356
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:22,431
Night unfurls its splendor

357
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:26,936
Grasp it, sense it

358
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:31,523
Tremulous and tender

359
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:35,027
Turn your face away

360
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:39,406
From the garish light of day

361
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:42,409
Turn your thoughts away

362
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:47,206
From cold, unfeeling light

363
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:55,297
And listen to
The music of the night

364
00:36:55,882 --> 00:37:02,596
Close your eyes and surrender
To your darkest dreams

365
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:09,395
Purge your thoughts of the life
You knew before

366
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:13,107
Close your eyes

367
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:18,279
Let your spirit start

368
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:27,413
To soar

369
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:37,256
And you'll live
As you've never lived before

370
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:45,931
Softly, deftly

371
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:50,185
Music shall caress you

372
00:37:50,353 --> 00:37:54,440
Hear it, feel it

373
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:58,777
Secretly possess you

374
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:01,780
Open up your mind

375
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:06,076
Let your fantasies unwind

376
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:10,164
In this darkness that you know

377
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:13,375
You cannot fight

378
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:22,051
The darkness of
The music of the night

379
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:28,474
Let your mind start a journey
Through a strange new world

380
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:35,022
Leave all thoughts of the life
You knew before

381
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:38,609
Let your soul take you

382
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:46,575
Where you long to be

383
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:56,502
Only then can you belong

384
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,047
To me

385
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:07,554
Floating, falling

386
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:12,476
Sweet intoxication

387
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:18,232
Touch me, trust me

388
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,195
Savor each sensation

389
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:26,698
Let the dream begin

390
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:31,370
Let your darker side give in

391
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:39,253
To the power of the music that I write

392
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:48,512
The power of
The music of the night

393
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:23,547
You alone can make my song take flight

394
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:28,594
Help me make

395
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:33,849
The music of the

396
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:45,819
Night

397
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,692
Christine?

398
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,915
Like yellow parchment is his skin

399
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:10,047
A great black hole serves
As the nose that never grew

400
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:16,970
You must be always on your guard

401
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:21,933
Or he will catch you
with his magical lasso

402
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:24,227
Oh, my.

403
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,402
Those who speak of what they know

404
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:38,450
Find too late that prudent silence is wise

405
00:43:39,243 --> 00:43:42,996
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue

406
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:47,876
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes.

407
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:20,909
I remember there was mist

408
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:28,500
Swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake

409
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:32,421
There were Candles all around

410
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:37,467
And on the lake there was a boat

411
00:44:38,302 --> 00:44:47,269
And in the boat there was a man

412
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:10,751
Who was that shape in the shadows?

413
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:16,214
Whose is the face in the mask?

414
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:28,059
Damn you!
You little prying Pandora

415
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:31,897
You little demon!
Is this what you wanted to see?

416
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:36,443
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah

417
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:40,071
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free

418
00:45:40,573 --> 00:45:42,657
Damn you!

419
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:46,077
Curse you!

420
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:53,585
Stranger than you dreamt it

421
00:45:53,753 --> 00:45:58,256
Can you even dare to look

422
00:45:58,424 --> 00:46:02,219
Or bear to think of me?

423
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:08,433
This loathsome gargoyle
Who burns in hell

424
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:13,647
But secretly yearns for heaven

425
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:17,400
Secretly, secretly

426
00:46:18,194 --> 00:46:20,570
Christine

427
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:26,868
Fear can turn to love

428
00:46:27,036 --> 00:46:31,873
You'll learn to see
To find the man

429
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:36,044
Behind the monster, this

430
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:41,800
Repulsive carcass
Who seems a beast

431
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:47,013
But secretly dreams of beauty

432
00:46:47,181 --> 00:46:51,476
Secretly, secretly

433
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:55,730
Oh, Christine

434
00:47:29,432 --> 00:47:31,349
Come, we must return.

435
00:47:31,517 --> 00:47:34,269
Those two fools who run
my theater will be missing you.

436
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:39,417
"Mystery after gala night"

437
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:42,420
It says
"Mystery of soprano's flight"

438
00:48:42,588 --> 00:48:44,756
"Mystified"
All the papers say

439
00:48:44,924 --> 00:48:47,717
"We are mystified
We suspect foul play"

440
00:48:47,885 --> 00:48:52,472
Bad news on soprano scene
First Carlotta, now Christine

441
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,934
Still at least the seats get sold

442
00:48:56,102 --> 00:49:02,190
Gossip's worth its weight in gold

443
00:49:03,192 --> 00:49:05,819
What a way to run a business

444
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:08,947
Spare me these unending trials

445
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:12,409
Half your cast disappears
But the crowd still cheers

446
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:13,618
Opera!

447
00:49:13,786 --> 00:49:15,662
To hell with Gluck and Handel
Have a scandal

448
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:19,290
- And you're sure to have a hit
- Damnable, will they all walk out?

449
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,876
- This is damnable
- Andre, please don't shout

450
00:49:22,044 --> 00:49:26,006
It's publicity, and the take is vast
Free publicity

451
00:49:26,173 --> 00:49:27,924
But we have no cast

452
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:30,844
Andre, have you seen the queue?

453
00:49:32,346 --> 00:49:36,057
It seems you've got one too

454
00:49:37,226 --> 00:49:43,231
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala
Christine was, in a word, sublime

455
00:49:43,399 --> 00:49:46,943
We were hardly bereft
When Carlotta left

456
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:49,070
On that note, the diva's a disaster

457
00:49:49,238 --> 00:49:51,990
Must you cast her
When she's seasons past her prime?"

458
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:54,617
"Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder

459
00:49:54,785 --> 00:49:57,454
My salary has not been paid

460
00:49:57,621 --> 00:50:02,167
Send it Care of the Ghost
By return of post PTO

461
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:06,004
No one likes a debtor
So it's better if my orders are obeyed"

462
00:50:07,131 --> 00:50:09,799
Who would have the gall to send this?

463
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:13,970
- Someone with a puerile brain
- These are both signed O.G.

464
00:50:14,138 --> 00:50:16,723
- Who the hell is he?
- Opera Ghost

465
00:50:16,891 --> 00:50:19,976
- It's nothing short of shocking
- He is mocking our position

466
00:50:20,144 --> 00:50:22,854
- In addition he wants money
- What a funny apparition

467
00:50:23,022 --> 00:50:25,815
To expect a large retainer
He is clearly quite insane

468
00:50:25,983 --> 00:50:27,567
- Where is she?
- Carlotta?

469
00:50:27,735 --> 00:50:29,402
l mean, Miss Daae
Where is she?

470
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,362
- How do we know?
- I want an answer

471
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:33,865
- You sent me this note
- What's this nonsense?

472
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:35,742
- Of Course not
- Don't look at us

473
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,827
- She's not with you?
- Of Course not

474
00:50:37,995 --> 00:50:41,372
- We're in the dark
- Don't argue, isn't this the letter you wrote?

475
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,209
And what is it that
We're meant to have wrote?

476
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:46,294
Written.

477
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:50,090
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.

478
00:50:50,257 --> 00:50:54,260
The Angel of Music
has her under his wing.

479
00:50:54,428 --> 00:50:57,680
Make no attempt to see her again."

480
00:50:57,848 --> 00:51:00,433
- If you didn't write it, who did?
- Where is he?

481
00:51:00,601 --> 00:51:03,144
- Welcome back
- Your precious patron, where is he?

482
00:51:03,312 --> 00:51:04,938
- What is it?
- I have your letter

483
00:51:05,106 --> 00:51:07,440
- A letter I rather resent
- Did you send it?

484
00:51:07,608 --> 00:51:09,651
- Of Course not
- As if he would

485
00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:11,945
- You didn't send it?
- Of Course not

486
00:51:12,113 --> 00:51:15,281
- What's going on?
- Tell me, this is not the letter you sent?

487
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:17,742
And what is it
That I'm meant to have sent?

488
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:24,415
"Your days at the Opera Populaire
are numbered.

489
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:28,044
Christine Daae will be singing
on your behalf tonight.

490
00:51:28,212 --> 00:51:30,630
Be prepared for a great misfortune ...

491
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:34,008
should you attempt to take her place."

492
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,557
Far too many notes for my taste

493
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:43,309
And most of them about Christine

494
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:48,273
AII we've heard since we came
Is Miss Daae's name

495
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,234
- Miss Daae has returned
- I hope no worse for wear

496
00:51:51,402 --> 00:51:54,320
- As far as we're concerned
- Where precisely is she now?

497
00:51:54,488 --> 00:51:56,823
I thought it best she was alone

498
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:58,783
She needed rest

499
00:51:58,951 --> 00:52:01,870
- May I see her?
- No, monsieur, she will see no one

500
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:03,955
Will she sing? Will she sing?

501
00:52:04,123 --> 00:52:07,041
- Here, l have a note
- Let me see it

502
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:08,793
Please.

503
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:17,218
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several
notes of the most amiable nature ...

504
00:52:17,386 --> 00:52:20,972
detailing how my theater is to be run.

505
00:52:21,807 --> 00:52:24,976
You have not followed my instructions.

506
00:52:25,144 --> 00:52:28,813
I shall give you one last chance.

507
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:33,651
Christine Daae has returned to you

508
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:41,075
And I am anxious
Her career should progress

509
00:52:41,243 --> 00:52:45,997
In the new production of Il Muto

510
00:52:46,165 --> 00:52:49,667
You will therefore Cast Carlotta

511
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:52,212
As the pageboy

512
00:52:53,297 --> 00:52:59,427
And put Miss Daae
In the role of countess

513
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,641
The role which Miss Daae plays

514
00:53:04,808 --> 00:53:08,144
Calls for charm and appeal

515
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:12,148
The role of the pageboy is silent

516
00:53:12,316 --> 00:53:17,946
Which makes my casting
In a word, ideal

517
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:24,494
I shall watch the performance
from my normal seat in box five ...

518
00:53:24,662 --> 00:53:27,288
which will be kept empty for me.

519
00:53:27,456 --> 00:53:29,624
Should these commands be ignored ...

520
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:34,254
a disaster beyond
your imagination will occur.

521
00:53:34,421 --> 00:53:40,260
I remain, gentlemen,
your obedient servant. O.G."

522
00:53:40,427 --> 00:53:42,053
- Christine
- Whatever next?

523
00:53:42,221 --> 00:53:44,973
- It's all a ploy to help Christine
- This is insane

524
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,392
I know who sent this
The vicomte, her lover

525
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:50,561
- Indeed! Can you believe this?
- Signora

526
00:53:51,563 --> 00:53:54,065
- Signora
- You are our star

527
00:53:54,233 --> 00:53:56,025
- And always will be
- Signora

528
00:53:56,193 --> 00:53:58,069
- The man is mad
- We don't take orders

529
00:53:58,237 --> 00:54:03,157
Miss Daae will be playing
the pageboy, the silent role.

530
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:05,743
Carlotta will be playing the lead

531
00:54:05,911 --> 00:54:10,999
- It's useless trying to appease me
- Appease her

532
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:14,544
- You're only saying this to please me
- To please her

533
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,308
- Who scorn his word, beware to those
- You have reviled me

534
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:32,353
- The angel sees, the angel knows
- You have rebuked me

535
00:54:32,521 --> 00:54:35,565
- Signora, pardon us
- You have replaced me

536
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:37,358
Please, signora, we beseech you

537
00:54:37,526 --> 00:54:40,403
- I must see her
- This hour shall see your darkest fears

538
00:54:40,571 --> 00:54:43,906
- The angel knows, the angel hears
- Where did she go?

539
00:54:44,074 --> 00:54:48,328
Signora, sing for us
Don't be a martyr

540
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:54,917
- What new surprises lie in store?
- Our star!

541
00:55:00,174 --> 00:55:03,551
Would you please give this
to Miss Daae? Miss Daae?

542
00:55:06,847 --> 00:55:09,349
Your public needs you.

543
00:55:09,516 --> 00:55:12,143
We need you too.

544
00:55:12,311 --> 00:55:16,314
Would you not rather have
Your precious little ingénue?

545
00:55:16,482 --> 00:55:19,233
- Signora, no.
- Signora, no.

546
00:55:19,401 --> 00:55:24,280
The world wants you

547
00:55:26,617 --> 00:55:32,789
Prima donna
First lady of the stage

548
00:55:32,956 --> 00:55:36,250
Your devotees
Are on their knees

549
00:55:36,418 --> 00:55:40,004
To implore you

550
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:47,345
Can you bow out when
They're shouting your name?

551
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:54,477
Think of how they all adore you

552
00:55:54,853 --> 00:56:01,526
Prima donna
Enchant us once again

553
00:56:01,693 --> 00:56:08,741
- Think of your muse
- And of the queues round the theater

554
00:56:09,535 --> 00:56:15,289
Can you deny us
The triumph in store?

555
00:56:15,457 --> 00:56:20,169
Sing, prima donna
Once more

556
00:56:20,337 --> 00:56:27,510
- Christine spoke of an angel
- Prima donna

557
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:30,763
Your song shall live again

558
00:56:30,931 --> 00:56:32,890
- Think of your public
- You took a snub

559
00:56:33,058 --> 00:56:36,477
- But there's a public who needs you
- She has heard the voice

560
00:56:36,645 --> 00:56:39,188
- Of the Angel of Music
- Those who hear your voice

561
00:56:39,356 --> 00:56:45,570
- Liken you to an angel
- Think of their cry of undying support

562
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:49,365
- We get our opera
- She gets her limelight

563
00:56:49,533 --> 00:56:54,287
- Follow where the limelight leads you
- Leading ladies are a trial

564
00:56:54,496 --> 00:57:00,251
Prima donna
Your song shall never die

565
00:57:00,419 --> 00:57:04,505
- You'll sing again and to unending ovation
- Orders, warnings

566
00:57:04,673 --> 00:57:07,842
- Lunatic demands
- Lunatic demands are regular occurrences

567
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:13,639
Think how you'll shine
In that final encore

568
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:17,685
Surely there'll be further scenes
Worse than this

569
00:57:17,853 --> 00:57:22,523
I must see these demands are rejected

570
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:26,194
Who'd believe a diva happy
To relieve a chorus girl

571
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:28,321
Who's gone and slept with the patron?

572
00:57:28,489 --> 00:57:31,908
Raoul and the soubrette
Entwined in love's duet

573
00:57:32,075 --> 00:57:35,453
Although he may demur
He must have been with her

574
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:38,998
You'd never get away
With all this in a play

575
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:42,418
But if it's loudly sung
And in a foreign tongue

576
00:57:42,586 --> 00:57:45,755
It's just the sort of story
Audiences adore

577
00:57:45,923 --> 00:57:49,800
- In fact, a perfect opera
- For if his curse is on the opera

578
00:57:49,968 --> 00:57:55,973
Prima donna, the world is at your feet

579
00:57:56,141 --> 00:58:02,605
A nation waits
And how it hates to be cheated

580
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:06,651
Light up the stage

581
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:11,656
With that age-old rapport

582
00:58:11,823 --> 00:58:17,870
Sing, prima donna

583
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:29,549
Once more

584
00:58:45,607 --> 00:58:47,525
Go on, go, go.

585
00:58:59,705 --> 00:59:04,292
They say that this youth
Has set my lady's heart aflame

586
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:06,711
His Lordship, sure
Would die of shock

587
00:59:06,878 --> 00:59:08,879
His Lordship is a laughingstock

588
00:59:09,047 --> 00:59:13,593
Should he suspect her, God protect her
Shame, shame, shame

589
00:59:14,261 --> 00:59:20,391
This faithless lady's
Bound for Hades

590
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:23,185
Shame, shame, shame

591
00:59:29,568 --> 00:59:32,528
Serafimo, your disguise is perfect

592
00:59:32,863 --> 00:59:35,781
Why, who can this be?

593
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:39,994
Gentle wife
Admit your loving husband

594
00:59:42,706 --> 00:59:45,374
That's exactly the sort of thing
the public loves.

595
00:59:46,918 --> 00:59:52,381
My love, I'm called to England
On affairs of state

596
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:56,761
And must leave you
With your new maid

597
01:00:00,182 --> 01:00:04,018
Though I would happily
take the maid with me.

598
01:00:04,186 --> 01:00:07,271
The old fool is leaving.

599
01:00:07,856 --> 01:00:12,777
It's the Countess de Charbourg.
She's invited us to her salon, you know.

600
01:00:12,944 --> 01:00:15,738
Nothing like that ever happened
in the junk business.

601
01:00:15,906 --> 01:00:17,114
Scrap metal.

602
01:00:31,672 --> 01:00:35,341
Serafimo, away with this pretense

603
01:00:35,509 --> 01:00:40,888
You cannot speak
But kiss me in my husband's absence

604
01:00:45,602 --> 01:00:48,396
Poor fool, he makes me laugh

605
01:00:54,486 --> 01:00:58,948
Time I tried to get a better
Better half

606
01:00:59,116 --> 01:01:01,909
Poor fool, he doesn't know

607
01:01:08,542 --> 01:01:12,461
If he knew the truth
He'd never ever go

608
01:01:12,629 --> 01:01:18,467
Did I not instruct that box five
was to be kept empty?

609
01:01:27,936 --> 01:01:29,895
He's here, the Phantom of the Opera.

610
01:01:30,522 --> 01:01:34,191
- It's him.
- Your part is silent, little toad.

611
01:01:35,527 --> 01:01:37,778
A toad, Madame?

612
01:01:38,238 --> 01:01:40,781
Perhaps it is you who are the toad.

613
01:01:47,414 --> 01:01:49,915
Why you spray on my chin
all the time, huh?

614
01:02:01,803 --> 01:02:04,972
Serafimo, away with this pretense

615
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:09,894
You cannot speak
But kiss me in my --

616
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,441
Gentlemen, please, please.

617
01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:25,201
Poor fool, he makes me laugh

618
01:02:29,122 --> 01:02:30,623
She's lost her voice.

619
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:35,002
Mother!

620
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:43,344
Bring the curtain in, please, will you?

621
01:02:45,597 --> 01:02:47,056
Get off.

622
01:02:47,224 --> 01:02:50,935
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize.

623
01:02:51,686 --> 01:02:57,775
The performance will continue
in 10 minutes' time ...

624
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:03,989
when the role of the countess
will be played by Miss Daae.

625
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,617
Thank you.

626
01:03:06,785 --> 01:03:09,036
Go, go, hurry up. Hurry up.

627
01:03:09,204 --> 01:03:14,291
Until then, we would crave your
indulgence for a few moments.

628
01:03:14,459 --> 01:03:19,797
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you
the ballet from Act 3 of tonight's opera.

629
01:03:19,965 --> 01:03:22,174
- What?
- Maestro ...

630
01:03:22,342 --> 01:03:24,510
the ballet, bring it forward, please.

631
01:03:24,678 --> 01:03:27,805
- The ballet.
- The ballet, now, please.

632
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:32,476
Thank you.

633
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:39,650
You're fired.

634
01:05:36,768 --> 01:05:39,561
- Are you all right?
- Raoul, we're not safe here.

635
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:45,484
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain in your seats.

636
01:05:45,652 --> 01:05:49,321
Do not panic.
It's simply an accident.

637
01:05:49,489 --> 01:05:50,531
An accident.

638
01:05:51,992 --> 01:05:54,201
Why have you brought me here?

639
01:05:54,369 --> 01:05:56,578
- We can't go back there
- We must return

640
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:59,623
He'll kill you
His eyes will find us there

641
01:05:59,791 --> 01:06:02,292
- Christine, don't say that
- Those eyes that burn

642
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:06,422
- Don't even think it
- If he has to kill a thousand men

643
01:06:06,589 --> 01:06:10,300
- Forget this waking nightmare
- The Phantom of the Opera will kill

644
01:06:10,468 --> 01:06:14,013
Believe me
There is no Phantom of the Opera

645
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:19,143
My God, who is this man
Who hunts to kill?

646
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:22,604
- This mask of death
- I can't escape from him

647
01:06:22,772 --> 01:06:25,607
- Whose is this voice you hear
- I never will

648
01:06:25,775 --> 01:06:30,946
- With every breath?
- And in this labyrinth

649
01:06:31,114 --> 01:06:33,323
Where night is blind

650
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:39,329
- The Phantom of the Opera is here
- The Phantom of the Opera is there

651
01:06:39,497 --> 01:06:41,290
- Inside my mind
- Inside your mind

652
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:45,794
There is no Phantom of the Opera

653
01:06:45,962 --> 01:06:49,757
Raoul, I've been there

654
01:06:49,924 --> 01:06:53,010
To his world of unending night

655
01:06:53,595 --> 01:06:58,348
To a world where the daylight
Dissolves into darkness

656
01:06:59,184 --> 01:07:01,977
Darkness

657
01:07:02,812 --> 01:07:07,066
Raoul, I've seen him

658
01:07:07,233 --> 01:07:10,778
Can I ever forget that sight?

659
01:07:11,613 --> 01:07:14,573
Can I ever escape from that face?

660
01:07:14,741 --> 01:07:20,829
So distorted, deformed
It was hardly a face

661
01:07:20,997 --> 01:07:24,875
In that darkness

662
01:07:25,043 --> 01:07:29,379
Darkness

663
01:07:32,258 --> 01:07:40,641
But his voice filled my spirit
With a strange, sweet sound

664
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:48,023
In that night
There was music in my mind

665
01:07:48,399 --> 01:07:54,321
And through music
My soul began

666
01:07:54,781 --> 01:08:02,204
To soar

667
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:06,041
And I heard

668
01:08:06,209 --> 01:08:11,839
- As I'd never heard before
- What you heard was a dream

669
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:16,844
And nothing more

670
01:08:17,971 --> 01:08:21,765
Yet in his eyes

671
01:08:21,933 --> 01:08:28,438
All the sadness of the world

672
01:08:29,274 --> 01:08:33,944
Those pleading eyes

673
01:08:34,112 --> 01:08:37,614
That both threaten

674
01:08:37,782 --> 01:08:45,205
And adore

675
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:52,796
Christine

676
01:08:53,298 --> 01:08:56,466
Christine ...

677
01:09:38,426 --> 01:09:41,803
No more talk of darkness

678
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:45,933
Forget these wide-eyed fears

679
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:50,354
I'm here
Nothing can harm you

680
01:09:50,521 --> 01:09:54,858
My words will warm and calm you

681
01:09:55,944 --> 01:09:59,238
Let me be your freedom

682
01:09:59,572 --> 01:10:03,325
Let daylight dry your tears

683
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:07,704
I'm here with you, beside you

684
01:10:07,872 --> 01:10:12,668
To guard you and to guide you

685
01:10:13,336 --> 01:10:16,838
Say you love me

686
01:10:17,006 --> 01:10:23,053
Every waking moment

687
01:10:23,221 --> 01:10:26,098
Turn my head

688
01:10:26,266 --> 01:10:32,604
With talk of summertime

689
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:38,068
Say you need me with you

690
01:10:38,236 --> 01:10:42,656
Now and always

691
01:10:43,408 --> 01:10:45,075
Promise me

692
01:10:45,243 --> 01:10:51,456
That all you say is true

693
01:10:52,625 --> 01:11:00,424
- That's all I ask of you
- Let me be your shelter

694
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:04,303
Let me be your light

695
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:08,348
You're safe
No one will find you

696
01:11:08,516 --> 01:11:13,020
Your fears are far behind you

697
01:11:13,187 --> 01:11:16,606
All I want is freedom

698
01:11:16,774 --> 01:11:20,360
A world with no more night

699
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:24,031
And you always beside me

700
01:11:24,198 --> 01:11:27,784
To hold me and to hide me

701
01:11:27,952 --> 01:11:31,830
Then say you'll share with me

702
01:11:31,998 --> 01:11:36,543
One love, one lifetime

703
01:11:36,711 --> 01:11:39,671
Let me lead you

704
01:11:39,839 --> 01:11:44,634
From your solitude

705
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:50,015
Say you need me
With you

706
01:11:50,183 --> 01:11:54,269
Here beside you

707
01:11:54,937 --> 01:12:02,194
Anywhere you go
Let me go too

708
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:04,196
Christine

709
01:12:04,364 --> 01:12:07,491
That's all I ask of you

710
01:12:07,658 --> 01:12:11,203
Say you'll share with me

711
01:12:11,371 --> 01:12:16,249
One love, one lifetime

712
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:25,175
Say the word
And I will follow you

713
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:29,221
Share each day with me

714
01:12:29,389 --> 01:12:33,809
Each night, each morning

715
01:12:34,811 --> 01:12:43,026
- Say you love me
- You know I do

716
01:12:43,569 --> 01:12:45,821
Love me

717
01:12:45,988 --> 01:12:52,536
That's all I ask of you

718
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:26,570
Anywhere you go, let me go too

719
01:13:27,613 --> 01:13:30,490
Love me

720
01:13:30,658 --> 01:13:40,667
That's all I ask of you

721
01:13:49,343 --> 01:13:51,261
I must go

722
01:13:51,429 --> 01:13:53,138
They'll wonder where I am

723
01:13:53,306 --> 01:13:55,265
Come with me, Raoul

724
01:13:55,433 --> 01:14:01,313
Christine, I love you

725
01:14:03,733 --> 01:14:06,401
Order your fine horses

726
01:14:06,569 --> 01:14:09,446
Be with them at the door

727
01:14:09,614 --> 01:14:12,449
And soon you'll be beside me

728
01:14:12,617 --> 01:14:15,535
You'll guard me and you'll guide me

729
01:14:34,972 --> 01:14:39,893
I gave you my music

730
01:14:40,937 --> 01:14:46,566
Made your song take wing

731
01:14:46,734 --> 01:14:52,364
And now
How you've repaid me

732
01:14:52,532 --> 01:14:58,912
Denied me
And betrayed me

733
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:06,711
He was bound to love you

734
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:11,508
When he heard you sing

735
01:15:11,676 --> 01:15:14,010
Christine

736
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:31,319
Say you'll share with me

737
01:15:31,487 --> 01:15:37,200
One love, one lifetime

738
01:15:37,577 --> 01:15:47,586
Say the word
And I will follow you

739
01:15:49,463 --> 01:15:54,843
Share each day with me

740
01:15:55,011 --> 01:15:59,806
Each night, each morning

741
01:16:01,517 --> 01:16:05,437
You will curse the day

742
01:16:05,605 --> 01:16:09,608
You did not do

743
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:14,863
All that the Phantom

744
01:16:15,031 --> 01:16:24,581
Asked of you

745
01:17:47,498 --> 01:17:48,957
Monsieur Andre.

746
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:50,917
Monsieur Firmin.

747
01:17:51,168 --> 01:17:54,629
Dear Andre, what a splendid party

748
01:17:54,797 --> 01:17:57,382
The prologue to a bright new year

749
01:17:57,550 --> 01:18:00,677
- Quite a night, I'm impressed
- Well, one does one's best

750
01:18:00,845 --> 01:18:03,263
- Here's to us
- The toast of all the city

751
01:18:03,431 --> 01:18:06,182
What a pity that
The Phantom Can't be here

752
01:18:09,937 --> 01:18:12,063
Masquerade!

753
01:18:12,231 --> 01:18:14,274
Paper faces on parade

754
01:18:14,442 --> 01:18:15,817
Masquerade

755
01:18:15,985 --> 01:18:20,447
Hide your face
So the world will never find you

756
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:22,991
Masquerade!

757
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:25,452
Every face a different shade

758
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:26,870
Masquerade

759
01:18:27,037 --> 01:18:30,749
Look around
There's another mask behind you

760
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:34,127
Flash of mauve, splash of puce
Fool and king, ghoul and goose

761
01:18:34,295 --> 01:18:37,589
Green and black, queen and priest
Trace of rouge, face of beast

762
01:18:37,757 --> 01:18:40,300
- Faces! Take your turn
- Take a ride

763
01:18:40,468 --> 01:18:42,927
- On the merry-go-round
- In an inhuman race

764
01:18:43,095 --> 01:18:46,222
Eye of gold, thigh of blue
True is false, who is who?

765
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:49,726
Curl of lip, swirl of gown
Ace of hearts, face of clown

766
01:18:49,894 --> 01:18:52,145
Faces!
Drink it in, drink it up

767
01:18:52,313 --> 01:18:54,773
Till you've drowned
In the light, in the sound

768
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:56,399
But who can name the face?

769
01:18:56,567 --> 01:18:58,818
Masquerade!

770
01:18:58,986 --> 01:19:02,947
Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade

771
01:19:03,115 --> 01:19:05,992
Take your fill
Let the spectacle astound you

772
01:19:07,495 --> 01:19:09,746
Masquerade!

773
01:19:09,914 --> 01:19:11,956
Burning glances, turning heads

774
01:19:12,124 --> 01:19:13,500
Masquerade

775
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:17,629
Stop and stare
At the sea of smiles around you

776
01:19:18,589 --> 01:19:19,881
Masquerade

777
01:19:20,883 --> 01:19:23,051
Seething shadows, breathing lies

778
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:24,636
Masquerade

779
01:19:24,804 --> 01:19:28,765
You can fool any friend
Who ever knew you

780
01:19:30,267 --> 01:19:32,101
Masquerade!

781
01:19:32,269 --> 01:19:33,812
Leering satyrs, peering eyes

782
01:19:34,271 --> 01:19:35,772
Masquerade

783
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:39,901
Run and hide
But a face will still pursue you

784
01:19:40,069 --> 01:19:41,444
- What a night
- What a crowd

785
01:19:41,612 --> 01:19:43,321
- Makes you glad
- Makes you proud

786
01:19:43,489 --> 01:19:46,366
- All the crème de la crème
- Watching us watching them

787
01:19:46,534 --> 01:19:49,244
- Three months of relief
- Of delight

788
01:19:49,411 --> 01:19:52,121
- Of Elysian peace
- And we can breathe at last

789
01:19:52,289 --> 01:19:53,790
- No more notes
- No more ghost

790
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:56,918
- Here's to health
- Here's a toast to a prosperous year

791
01:19:57,086 --> 01:20:01,214
- To our friends who are here
- And may our splendor never fade

792
01:20:01,382 --> 01:20:03,383
What a blessed release

793
01:20:03,551 --> 01:20:05,176
And what a masquerade

794
01:20:05,344 --> 01:20:06,970
Think of it

795
01:20:07,137 --> 01:20:11,349
A secret engagement.
Look, your future bride.

796
01:20:11,517 --> 01:20:14,060
- Just think of it.
- But why is it secret?

797
01:20:14,228 --> 01:20:17,438
What have we to hide?
You promised me.

798
01:20:17,606 --> 01:20:20,483
- No, Raoul. Please don't. They'll see.
- Let them see.

799
01:20:20,651 --> 01:20:23,361
It's an engagement, not a crime.

800
01:20:23,529 --> 01:20:27,407
Christine, what are you afraid of?

801
01:20:27,575 --> 01:20:30,827
- Let's not argue
- Let's not argue

802
01:20:30,995 --> 01:20:33,246
- Please pretend
- I can only hope

803
01:20:33,414 --> 01:20:38,668
- You will understand in time
- I'll understand in time

804
01:21:51,659 --> 01:21:55,662
Masquerade!

805
01:21:55,955 --> 01:21:59,582
Paper faces on parade

806
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:01,000
Masquerade

807
01:22:01,168 --> 01:22:04,921
Hide your face
So the world will never find you

808
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:08,383
Masquerade!

809
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:12,303
Every face a different shade
Masquerade

810
01:22:12,471 --> 01:22:16,307
Look around
There's another mask behind you

811
01:22:17,726 --> 01:22:19,769
Masquerade!

812
01:22:19,937 --> 01:22:23,815
Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade

813
01:22:23,983 --> 01:22:28,027
Stop and stare
At the sea of smiles around you

814
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:31,739
Masquerade!

815
01:22:31,907 --> 01:22:35,827
Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade

816
01:22:35,995 --> 01:22:41,124
Take your fill
Let the spectacle astound you

817
01:23:01,645 --> 01:23:05,606
Why so silent, good messieurs?

818
01:23:06,525 --> 01:23:10,737
Did you think that
I had left you for good?

819
01:23:12,197 --> 01:23:15,283
Have you missed me, good messieurs?

820
01:23:15,617 --> 01:23:19,245
I have written you an opera

821
01:23:21,582 --> 01:23:25,710
Here, I bring the finished score

822
01:23:25,878 --> 01:23:28,629
Don Juan Triumphant

823
01:23:31,425 --> 01:23:35,011
Fondest greetings to you all

824
01:23:35,763 --> 01:23:41,309
A few instructions
Just before rehearsal starts

825
01:23:42,144 --> 01:23:45,605
Carlotta must be taught to act

826
01:23:45,773 --> 01:23:50,651
Not her normal trick
Of strutting round the stage

827
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:55,448
Our Don Juan must lose some weight

828
01:23:55,616 --> 01:23:57,575
It's not healthy

829
01:23:57,743 --> 01:24:00,870
In a man of Piangi's age

830
01:24:02,581 --> 01:24:05,291
And my managers must learn

831
01:24:05,459 --> 01:24:09,003
That their place is in an office

832
01:24:09,588 --> 01:24:12,715
Not the arts

833
01:24:15,052 --> 01:24:17,053
As for our star

834
01:24:18,055 --> 01:24:20,598
Miss Christine Daae

835
01:24:23,894 --> 01:24:27,939
No doubt she'll do her best

836
01:24:28,107 --> 01:24:32,026
It's true her voice is good

837
01:24:32,194 --> 01:24:38,157
She knows, though
Should she wish to excel

838
01:24:38,325 --> 01:24:41,702
She has much still to learn

839
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:47,667
If pride will let her
Return to me

840
01:24:47,835 --> 01:24:53,089
Her teacher

841
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:30,668
Your chains are still mine!

842
01:25:30,836 --> 01:25:32,253
You belong to me!

843
01:26:07,206 --> 01:26:10,166
- Madame Giry --
- Please, I know no more than anyone else.

844
01:26:10,334 --> 01:26:13,461
- That's not true!
- Monsieur, don't ask.

845
01:26:13,629 --> 01:26:16,672
- There have been too many accidents.
- Accidents?

846
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,841
Please, Madame Giry ...

847
01:26:19,009 --> 01:26:20,676
for all our sakes.

848
01:26:23,889 --> 01:26:26,015
Very well.

849
01:26:48,038 --> 01:26:50,248
It was years ago.

850
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:54,710
There was a traveling fair in the city.

851
01:26:55,295 --> 01:26:57,171
Gypsies.

852
01:26:58,382 --> 01:27:00,508
I was very young.

853
01:27:01,176 --> 01:27:03,803
Studying to be a ballerina.

854
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,473
One of many.

855
01:27:08,016 --> 01:27:10,559
Living in the dormitories
of the opera house.

856
01:27:19,987 --> 01:27:22,863
See the wonder from the East!

857
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:29,370
Come.

858
01:27:29,621 --> 01:27:31,455
Come inside.

859
01:27:32,457 --> 01:27:36,794
Come and see the Devil's Child.

860
01:28:09,536 --> 01:28:15,082
Behold, mesdames and messieurs,
the Devil's Child!

861
01:28:22,674 --> 01:28:24,967
Devil's Child.

862
01:29:03,632 --> 01:29:05,466
Murder!

863
01:29:05,634 --> 01:29:08,010
- Murder!
- Which way?!

864
01:29:08,178 --> 01:29:10,971
That way! That way!

865
01:29:11,139 --> 01:29:13,557
He's getting away!

866
01:29:42,963 --> 01:29:47,133
I hid him from the world
and its cruelties.

867
01:29:48,552 --> 01:29:51,053
He has known nothing else
of life since then ...

868
01:29:51,221 --> 01:29:53,556
except this opera house.

869
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:58,269
It was his playground ...

870
01:29:58,687 --> 01:30:00,521
and now his artistic domain.

871
01:30:00,689 --> 01:30:02,440
He's a genius.

872
01:30:02,607 --> 01:30:06,026
He's an architect and designer.

873
01:30:06,194 --> 01:30:09,405
He's a composer and a magician.

874
01:30:09,573 --> 01:30:12,741
- A genius, monsieur.
- But clearly, Madame Giry ...

875
01:30:12,909 --> 01:30:15,578
genius has turned to madness.

876
01:31:32,906 --> 01:31:34,406
- Monsieur.
- Where to?

877
01:31:34,574 --> 01:31:35,950
The cemetery.

878
01:32:16,408 --> 01:32:19,326
To my father's grave, please.

879
01:32:35,969 --> 01:32:39,305
- Where have they gone?
- The cemetery.

880
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:58,449
In sleep, he sang to me

881
01:32:58,617 --> 01:33:02,953
ln dreams, he came

882
01:33:03,288 --> 01:33:07,916
That voice, which calls to me

883
01:33:08,084 --> 01:33:12,421
And speaks my name

884
01:33:51,836 --> 01:33:55,714
Little Lotte thought of everything
and nothing.

885
01:33:57,467 --> 01:34:02,638
Her father promised her that he would
send her the Angel of Music.

886
01:34:04,766 --> 01:34:13,065
Her father promised her.

887
01:34:21,408 --> 01:34:28,288
You were once
My one companion

888
01:34:28,456 --> 01:34:34,545
You were all that mattered

889
01:34:36,047 --> 01:34:43,721
You were once
A friend and father

890
01:34:45,014 --> 01:34:51,687
Then my world was shattered

891
01:34:52,522 --> 01:34:59,153
Wishing you were somehow here again

892
01:34:59,529 --> 01:35:05,367
Wishing you were somehow near

893
01:35:06,244 --> 01:35:11,999
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed

894
01:35:12,167 --> 01:35:18,505
Somehow you would be here

895
01:35:19,632 --> 01:35:25,804
Wishing I could hear your voice again

896
01:35:26,306 --> 01:35:32,019
Knowing that I never would

897
01:35:32,687 --> 01:35:39,067
Dreaming of you
Won't help me to do

898
01:35:39,235 --> 01:35:45,115
All that you dreamed I could

899
01:35:46,326 --> 01:35:52,372
Passing bells and sculpted angels

900
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:58,545
Cold and monumental

901
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,757
Seem for you

902
01:36:01,925 --> 01:36:06,094
The wrong companions

903
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:13,769
You were warm and gentle

904
01:36:28,284 --> 01:36:34,248
Too many years
Fighting back tears

905
01:36:34,415 --> 01:36:40,963
Why can't the past just die?

906
01:36:41,172 --> 01:36:48,595
Wishing you were somehow here again

907
01:36:49,389 --> 01:36:56,186
Knowing we must say goodbye

908
01:36:56,396 --> 01:37:02,442
Try to forgive
Teach me to live

909
01:37:02,694 --> 01:37:08,282
Give me the strength to try

910
01:37:08,575 --> 01:37:15,497
No more memories
No more silent tears

911
01:37:15,665 --> 01:37:19,418
No more gazing across

912
01:37:19,586 --> 01:37:27,676
The wasted years

913
01:37:29,053 --> 01:37:33,307
Help me say

914
01:37:33,474 --> 01:37:39,730
Goodbye

915
01:37:41,524 --> 01:37:46,361
Help me say

916
01:37:47,155 --> 01:37:55,537
Goodbye

917
01:38:10,637 --> 01:38:16,350
Wandering child
So lost, so helpless

918
01:38:16,517 --> 01:38:21,772
Yearning for my guidance

919
01:38:22,899 --> 01:38:28,070
Angel or father
Friend or phantom?

920
01:38:28,237 --> 01:38:33,742
- Who is it there staring?
- Have you forgotten your angel?

921
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:39,289
Angel, oh, speak
What endless longings

922
01:38:39,457 --> 01:38:44,878
Echo in this whisper

923
01:38:45,046 --> 01:38:49,716
Too long you've wandered in winter

924
01:38:49,884 --> 01:38:54,179
Far from my fathering gaze

925
01:38:55,431 --> 01:38:59,393
- Wildly, my mind beats against you
- You resist

926
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:05,607
- Yet your soul obeys
- Yet the soul obeys

927
01:39:06,275 --> 01:39:12,072
- Angel of Music, you denied me
- Angel of Music, I denied you

928
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:18,495
- Turning from true beauty
- Turning from true beauty

929
01:39:18,663 --> 01:39:23,792
- Angel of Music, do not shun me
- Angel of Music, my protector

930
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:28,338
- Come to your strange angel
- Come to me, strange angel

931
01:39:28,506 --> 01:39:33,844
I am your Angel of Music

932
01:39:34,178 --> 01:39:36,722
Come to me, Angel

933
01:39:37,515 --> 01:39:39,224
- Of Music
- No, Christine! Wait!

934
01:39:40,143 --> 01:39:41,893
Wait!

935
01:39:42,645 --> 01:39:44,813
- Raoul!
- Whatever you believe, this man ...

936
01:39:44,981 --> 01:39:47,107
this thing is not your father!

937
01:41:02,850 --> 01:41:04,059
No, Raoul!

938
01:41:04,268 --> 01:41:05,727
No.

939
01:41:06,062 --> 01:41:07,312
Not like this.

940
01:41:33,714 --> 01:41:37,801
Now let it be war upon you both.

941
01:41:43,641 --> 01:41:46,059
We have all been blind

942
01:41:46,227 --> 01:41:49,896
And yet the answer
is staring us in the face

943
01:41:50,064 --> 01:41:52,774
This could be the Chance

944
01:41:52,942 --> 01:41:55,193
To ensnare our Clever friend

945
01:41:55,361 --> 01:41:57,445
- We're listening
- Go on

946
01:41:57,613 --> 01:42:00,448
We shall play his game

947
01:42:00,616 --> 01:42:04,369
Perform his work
But remember, we hold the ace

948
01:42:04,537 --> 01:42:08,582
For if Miss Daae sings
He is certain to attend

949
01:42:08,749 --> 01:42:12,586
- We are certain the doors are barred
- We are certain the police are there

950
01:42:12,753 --> 01:42:14,254
We are certain they're armed

951
01:42:14,422 --> 01:42:16,298
The Curtain falls

952
01:42:16,465 --> 01:42:18,049
His reign will end

953
01:42:47,413 --> 01:42:49,331
Raoul, I'm frightened.

954
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,376
Don't make me do this.

955
01:42:55,421 --> 01:42:57,130
Raoul.

956
01:42:57,298 --> 01:42:59,507
It scares me.

957
01:43:00,259 --> 01:43:03,386
Don't put me through
this ordeal by fire.

958
01:43:05,014 --> 01:43:06,723
He'll take me.

959
01:43:07,767 --> 01:43:09,351
I know.

960
01:43:10,561 --> 01:43:12,896
We'll be parted forever.

961
01:43:13,356 --> 01:43:15,190
He won't let me go.

962
01:43:18,194 --> 01:43:20,487
What I once used to dream ...

963
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,323
I now dread.

964
01:43:24,825 --> 01:43:27,744
If he finds me, it won't ever end.

965
01:43:28,246 --> 01:43:31,498
And he'll always be there

966
01:43:31,666 --> 01:43:34,918
Singing songs in my head

967
01:43:35,086 --> 01:43:37,879
He'll always be there

968
01:43:38,047 --> 01:43:43,635
Singing songs in my head

969
01:43:48,391 --> 01:43:53,228
You said yourself

970
01:43:53,396 --> 01:44:00,318
He was nothing but a man

971
01:44:02,571 --> 01:44:07,492
Yet while he lives

972
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:11,705
He will haunt us

973
01:44:11,872 --> 01:44:19,337
Till we're dead

974
01:44:23,134 --> 01:44:26,094
Twisted every way

975
01:44:26,262 --> 01:44:29,639
What answer can I give?

976
01:44:29,807 --> 01:44:32,350
Am I to risk my life

977
01:44:32,518 --> 01:44:36,021
To win the Chance to live?

978
01:44:36,188 --> 01:44:38,773
Can I betray the man

979
01:44:38,941 --> 01:44:42,402
Who once inspired my voice?

980
01:44:42,570 --> 01:44:45,488
Do I become his prey?

981
01:44:45,656 --> 01:44:47,907
Do I have any choice?

982
01:44:48,075 --> 01:44:50,493
He kills without a thought

983
01:44:50,661 --> 01:44:53,288
He murders all that's good

984
01:44:53,456 --> 01:44:56,124
I know I can't refuse

985
01:44:56,292 --> 01:44:58,793
And yet, I wish I could

986
01:44:58,961 --> 01:45:01,338
Oh, God, if I agree

987
01:45:01,505 --> 01:45:04,632
What horrors wait for me

988
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:10,764
In this, the Phantom's opera?

989
01:45:11,974 --> 01:45:15,477
Christine, Christine

990
01:45:15,644 --> 01:45:19,939
Don't think that I don't Care

991
01:45:20,107 --> 01:45:24,319
But every hope and every prayer

992
01:45:24,487 --> 01:45:29,824
Rests on you now

993
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:51,805
Seal my fate tonight

994
01:45:51,972 --> 01:45:57,811
I hate to have to cut the fun short

995
01:45:57,978 --> 01:46:01,564
But the joke's wearing thin

996
01:46:01,732 --> 01:46:05,193
Let the audience in

997
01:46:05,361 --> 01:46:10,115
Let my opera begin

998
01:46:36,809 --> 01:46:39,644
Here the sire may serve the dam

999
01:46:40,438 --> 01:46:44,399
Here the master takes his meat

1000
01:46:44,733 --> 01:46:48,361
Here the sacrificial lamb

1001
01:46:48,529 --> 01:46:51,698
Utters one despairing bleat

1002
01:46:52,241 --> 01:46:54,576
Poor young maiden

1003
01:46:54,743 --> 01:46:58,955
For the thrill on your tongue
Of stolen sweets

1004
01:46:59,123 --> 01:47:01,958
You will have to pay the bill

1005
01:47:02,126 --> 01:47:05,920
Tangled in the winding sheets

1006
01:47:06,505 --> 01:47:10,633
Serve the meal and serve the maid

1007
01:47:10,801 --> 01:47:16,598
Serve the master so that when
Tables, plans and maids are laid

1008
01:47:16,891 --> 01:47:20,768
Don Juan triumphs

1009
01:47:20,936 --> 01:47:30,945
Once again

1010
01:47:43,417 --> 01:47:46,336
Passarino, faithful friend

1011
01:47:46,504 --> 01:47:49,005
Once again recite the plan

1012
01:47:49,173 --> 01:47:51,841
Your young guest believes I'm you

1013
01:47:52,009 --> 01:47:55,220
l, the master
You, the man

1014
01:47:55,596 --> 01:47:59,724
When you met you wore my cloak
She could not have seen your face

1015
01:47:59,892 --> 01:48:04,395
She believes she dines with me
In her master's borrowed place

1016
01:48:04,563 --> 01:48:08,358
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff
Stealing what, in truth, is mine

1017
01:48:08,526 --> 01:48:12,820
When it's late and modesty
Starts to mellow with the wine

1018
01:48:12,988 --> 01:48:16,366
You come home, I use your voice
Slam the door like Crack of doom

1019
01:48:16,534 --> 01:48:21,037
I shall say, "Come hide with me
Where, oh, where? Of course, my room!"

1020
01:48:21,497 --> 01:48:25,291
- Poor thing hasn't got a chance
- Here's my hat, my cloak and sword

1021
01:48:25,459 --> 01:48:30,213
Conquest is assured
If I do not forget myself and laugh

1022
01:48:38,681 --> 01:48:46,104
No thoughts within her head
But thoughts of joy

1023
01:48:46,397 --> 01:48:49,983
No dreams within her heart

1024
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:57,156
But dreams of love

1025
01:49:02,538 --> 01:49:04,455
Master?

1026
01:49:04,707 --> 01:49:06,833
Passarino

1027
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:13,131
Go away, for the trap is set

1028
01:49:13,299 --> 01:49:19,387
And waits for its prey

1029
01:49:22,641 --> 01:49:26,561
You have come here

1030
01:49:27,146 --> 01:49:31,566
In pursuit of your deepest urge

1031
01:49:31,734 --> 01:49:35,695
In pursuit of that wish
Which till now

1032
01:49:35,863 --> 01:49:39,032
Has been silent

1033
01:49:39,241 --> 01:49:42,076
Silent

1034
01:49:43,078 --> 01:49:47,373
I have brought you

1035
01:49:47,541 --> 01:49:51,836
That our passions may fuse and merge

1036
01:49:52,004 --> 01:49:56,174
In your mind
You've already succumbed to me

1037
01:49:56,342 --> 01:50:02,055
Dropped all defenses
Completely succumbed to me

1038
01:50:02,681 --> 01:50:05,308
Now you are here with me

1039
01:50:05,476 --> 01:50:08,269
No second thoughts

1040
01:50:08,687 --> 01:50:13,232
You've decided

1041
01:50:15,277 --> 01:50:19,030
Decided

1042
01:50:22,743 --> 01:50:27,372
Past the point of no return

1043
01:50:28,874 --> 01:50:31,626
No backward glances

1044
01:50:31,794 --> 01:50:35,380
Our games of make-believe

1045
01:50:35,547 --> 01:50:39,425
Are at an end

1046
01:50:42,137 --> 01:50:46,516
Past all thought of "if" or "when"

1047
01:50:48,268 --> 01:50:50,603
No use resisting

1048
01:50:51,146 --> 01:50:53,648
Abandon thought

1049
01:50:53,816 --> 01:50:59,153
And let the dream descend

1050
01:50:59,321 --> 01:51:04,158
What raging fire shall flood the soul?

1051
01:51:04,326 --> 01:51:08,287
What rich desire unlocks its door?

1052
01:51:08,455 --> 01:51:16,212
What sweet seduction lies before us?

1053
01:51:17,506 --> 01:51:22,009
Past the point of no return

1054
01:51:23,387 --> 01:51:25,638
The final threshold

1055
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:30,268
What warm, unspoken secrets

1056
01:51:30,436 --> 01:51:33,896
Will we learn?

1057
01:51:34,064 --> 01:51:38,901
Beyond the point of no

1058
01:51:40,154 --> 01:51:46,033
Return

1059
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:50,747
You have brought me

1060
01:51:50,914 --> 01:51:55,084
To that moment when words run dry

1061
01:51:55,252 --> 01:51:58,755
To that moment when speech disappears

1062
01:51:58,922 --> 01:52:02,216
Into silence

1063
01:52:02,634 --> 01:52:05,428
Silence

1064
01:52:05,596 --> 01:52:09,682
I have come here

1065
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:14,228
Hardly knowing the reason why

1066
01:52:14,396 --> 01:52:17,899
In my mind I've already imagined

1067
01:52:18,066 --> 01:52:23,863
Our bodies entwining
Defenseless and silent

1068
01:52:24,031 --> 01:52:27,033
Now I am here with you

1069
01:52:27,451 --> 01:52:30,369
No second thoughts

1070
01:52:30,537 --> 01:52:36,167
I've decided

1071
01:52:38,337 --> 01:52:43,841
Decided

1072
01:52:45,803 --> 01:52:50,556
Past the point of no return

1073
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:53,976
No going back now

1074
01:52:54,144 --> 01:53:01,818
Our passion play
Has now at last begun

1075
01:53:03,987 --> 01:53:09,033
Past all thought of right or wrong

1076
01:53:09,952 --> 01:53:12,453
One final question

1077
01:53:12,621 --> 01:53:16,123
How long should we two wait

1078
01:53:16,291 --> 01:53:20,169
Before we're one?

1079
01:53:20,587 --> 01:53:24,924
When will the blood begin to race?

1080
01:53:25,092 --> 01:53:28,636
The sleeping bud burst into bloom?

1081
01:53:28,804 --> 01:53:32,306
When will the flames at last

1082
01:53:32,474 --> 01:53:38,020
Consume us?

1083
01:53:38,522 --> 01:53:43,776
Past the point of no return

1084
01:53:45,487 --> 01:53:48,739
The final threshold

1085
01:53:48,907 --> 01:53:51,534
The bridge is crossed

1086
01:53:52,244 --> 01:53:58,207
So stand and watch it burn

1087
01:53:58,375 --> 01:54:06,382
We've passed the point of no

1088
01:54:07,092 --> 01:54:11,262
Return

1089
01:54:31,116 --> 01:54:35,953
Say you'll share with me

1090
01:54:36,121 --> 01:54:38,706
One love

1091
01:54:38,874 --> 01:54:42,084
One lifetime

1092
01:54:42,669 --> 01:54:46,380
Lead me, save me

1093
01:54:46,548 --> 01:54:50,843
From my solitude

1094
01:54:53,805 --> 01:54:58,684
Say you want me with you

1095
01:54:58,852 --> 01:55:04,065
Here beside you

1096
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:08,736
Anywhere you go

1097
01:55:08,904 --> 01:55:13,407
Let me go too

1098
01:55:13,575 --> 01:55:16,077
Christine

1099
01:55:16,244 --> 01:55:21,540
That's all I ask of --

1100
01:56:09,131 --> 01:56:10,506
Go!

1101
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,818
Piangi, my love!

1102
01:56:35,032 --> 01:56:36,449
Oh, my God!

1103
01:56:36,616 --> 01:56:38,242
We're ruined, Andre. Ruined!

1104
01:56:51,214 --> 01:56:52,798
Where did he take her?

1105
01:56:52,966 --> 01:56:55,176
Come with me.
I will take you to him.

1106
01:56:55,343 --> 01:56:58,512
But remember, keep your hand
at the level of your eyes!

1107
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:00,681
- I'll come with you!
- No, Meg, no.

1108
01:57:00,849 --> 01:57:03,392
You must stay here.
Come with me. Do as I say.

1109
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:05,061
No!

1110
01:57:06,646 --> 01:57:12,401
Down once more to the dungeons
Of my black despair

1111
01:57:12,736 --> 01:57:18,491
Down we plunge to the prison
Of my mind

1112
01:57:18,658 --> 01:57:22,286
Down that path into darkness

1113
01:57:22,454 --> 01:57:26,290
Deep as hell

1114
01:57:30,378 --> 01:57:33,923
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained
In this cold and dismal place?

1115
01:57:34,257 --> 01:57:38,177
Not for any mortal sin
But the wickedness of my abhorrent face!

1116
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:46,560
Track down this murderer!
He must be found!

1117
01:57:46,728 --> 01:57:48,312
Hounded out by everyone

1118
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,397
Met with hatred everywhere

1119
01:57:50,565 --> 01:57:52,608
No kind words from anyone

1120
01:57:52,776 --> 01:57:55,194
No compassion anywhere

1121
01:57:55,362 --> 01:57:56,737
Christine

1122
01:57:58,198 --> 01:58:02,660
Why?

1123
01:58:06,414 --> 01:58:11,669
- Your hand at the level of your eyes
- At the level of your eyes

1124
01:58:11,837 --> 01:58:14,421
At the level of your eyes

1125
01:58:14,589 --> 01:58:17,258
This is as far as I dare go.

1126
01:58:18,385 --> 01:58:19,844
Thank you.

1127
02:00:05,075 --> 02:00:07,368
Have you gorged yourself at last

1128
02:00:07,535 --> 02:00:10,079
In your lust for blood?

1129
02:00:13,708 --> 02:00:15,918
Am I now to be prey

1130
02:00:16,086 --> 02:00:18,629
To your lust for flesh?

1131
02:00:21,883 --> 02:00:26,387
That fate which Condemns me
To wallow in blood

1132
02:00:27,389 --> 02:00:32,685
Has also denied me
The joys of the flesh

1133
02:00:33,728 --> 02:00:36,063
This face, the infection

1134
02:00:36,606 --> 02:00:39,566
Which poisons our love

1135
02:00:41,069 --> 02:00:45,531
This face which earned

1136
02:00:45,699 --> 02:00:49,785
A mother's fear and loathing

1137
02:00:49,953 --> 02:00:51,745
A mask

1138
02:00:51,913 --> 02:00:59,253
My first unfeeling
Scrap of clothing

1139
02:00:59,421 --> 02:01:01,839
Pity comes too late

1140
02:01:02,007 --> 02:01:05,551
Turn around and face your fate

1141
02:01:05,719 --> 02:01:09,346
An eternity of this

1142
02:01:10,682 --> 02:01:14,435
Before your eyes

1143
02:01:26,948 --> 02:01:30,868
This haunted face

1144
02:01:31,036 --> 02:01:38,667
Holds no horror for me now

1145
02:01:41,212 --> 02:01:45,632
It's in your soul

1146
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:54,641
That the true distortion lies

1147
02:01:56,561 --> 02:02:00,230
Wait! I think, my dear
We have a guest

1148
02:02:01,191 --> 02:02:02,441
- Sir
- Raoul!

1149
02:02:02,817 --> 02:02:06,320
This is indeed an unparalleled delight

1150
02:02:06,946 --> 02:02:09,239
I had rather hoped

1151
02:02:09,407 --> 02:02:11,033
That you would come

1152
02:02:12,494 --> 02:02:15,162
And now, my wish comes true

1153
02:02:15,330 --> 02:02:17,164
- You have truly made my night
- Let me go.

1154
02:02:17,332 --> 02:02:18,624
Free her!

1155
02:02:18,792 --> 02:02:21,168
Do what you like
Only free her!

1156
02:02:21,336 --> 02:02:24,129
- Have you no pity?
- Your lover makes a passionate plea

1157
02:02:24,297 --> 02:02:26,840
- Please, Raoul, it's useless
- I love her

1158
02:02:27,008 --> 02:02:29,343
Does that mean nothing?
I love her!

1159
02:02:29,511 --> 02:02:32,888
- Show some compassion
- The world showed no compassion to me!

1160
02:02:33,056 --> 02:02:37,017
Christine, Christine
Let me see her

1161
02:02:37,185 --> 02:02:40,020
Be my guest, sir

1162
02:02:42,190 --> 02:02:46,819
Monsieur, I bid you welcome

1163
02:02:46,986 --> 02:02:52,616
Did you think that I would harm her?

1164
02:02:52,784 --> 02:02:56,620
Why would I make her pay

1165
02:02:56,788 --> 02:03:01,291
For the sins which are yours?

1166
02:03:02,544 --> 02:03:05,546
Order your fine horses now!

1167
02:03:05,713 --> 02:03:08,215
Raise up your hand
To the level of your eyes!

1168
02:03:08,383 --> 02:03:10,384
Nothing can save you now

1169
02:03:10,552 --> 02:03:12,761
Except perhaps Christine

1170
02:03:13,930 --> 02:03:16,723
Start a new life with me

1171
02:03:16,891 --> 02:03:19,435
Buy his freedom with your love

1172
02:03:20,186 --> 02:03:22,771
Refuse me, and you send
Your lover to his death!

1173
02:03:22,939 --> 02:03:24,773
This is the Choice!

1174
02:03:24,941 --> 02:03:31,113
This is the point of no return!

1175
02:03:34,409 --> 02:03:38,078
The tears I might have shed

1176
02:03:38,246 --> 02:03:41,373
For your dark fate

1177
02:03:41,541 --> 02:03:45,252
Grow Cold and turn

1178
02:03:45,420 --> 02:03:49,173
To tears of hate

1179
02:03:50,842 --> 02:03:54,136
Christine, forgive me
Please, forgive me

1180
02:03:55,638 --> 02:04:01,768
- I did it all for you and all for nothing
- Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend

1181
02:04:01,936 --> 02:04:03,687
- We had such hopes
- Too late for turning back

1182
02:04:03,855 --> 02:04:06,106
- Now those hopes are shattered
- Too late for prayers and pity

1183
02:04:06,274 --> 02:04:10,110
- Say you love him
- All hope of cries for help

1184
02:04:10,278 --> 02:04:14,531
- And my life is over
- No point in fighting

1185
02:04:14,699 --> 02:04:21,830
- For either way you choose you cannot win
- But either way you choose he has to win

1186
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:26,126
So do you end your days with me?

1187
02:04:26,544 --> 02:04:29,963
Or do you send him to his grave?

1188
02:04:30,131 --> 02:04:37,679
Why make her lie to you
To save me?

1189
02:04:38,264 --> 02:04:42,976
- Angel of Music
- Past the point of no return

1190
02:04:43,144 --> 02:04:45,437
- Christine, say no!
- Who deserves this?

1191
02:04:45,605 --> 02:04:50,150
- Don't throw your life away for my sake
- His life is now the prize

1192
02:04:50,318 --> 02:04:55,989
- Which you must earn
- I fought so hard to free you

1193
02:04:57,450 --> 02:05:06,625
- You've passed the point of no return
- Angel of Music

1194
02:05:06,793 --> 02:05:11,338
You deceived me

1195
02:05:13,007 --> 02:05:16,260
I gave you my mind blindly.

1196
02:05:17,178 --> 02:05:19,471
You try my patience.

1197
02:05:19,639 --> 02:05:21,515
Make your choice.

1198
02:05:34,821 --> 02:05:40,867
Pitiful Creature of darkness

1199
02:05:41,661 --> 02:05:47,457
What kind of life have you known?

1200
02:05:47,625 --> 02:05:52,170
God give me courage to show you

1201
02:05:53,131 --> 02:05:59,386
You are not alone

1202
02:06:52,273 --> 02:06:55,776
Track down this murderer

1203
02:06:56,402 --> 02:06:59,363
Take her! Forget me
Forget all of this

1204
02:07:01,491 --> 02:07:03,075
Leave me alone

1205
02:07:03,534 --> 02:07:05,661
Forget all you've seen

1206
02:07:06,329 --> 02:07:08,372
Go now
Don't let them find you

1207
02:07:10,208 --> 02:07:13,293
Take the boat
Swear to me never to tell

1208
02:07:15,088 --> 02:07:18,131
The secrets you know
Of the angel in hell

1209
02:07:18,299 --> 02:07:24,471
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Deep down below

1210
02:07:24,639 --> 02:07:26,139
Go now

1211
02:07:26,307 --> 02:07:29,393
Go now and leave me!

1212
02:07:54,669 --> 02:07:56,670
Masquerade

1213
02:07:57,839 --> 02:08:00,507
Paper faces on parade

1214
02:08:00,675 --> 02:08:02,884
Masquerade

1215
02:08:03,052 --> 02:08:09,433
Hide your face
So the world will never find you

1216
02:08:19,694 --> 02:08:27,409
Christine, I love you

1217
02:09:20,505 --> 02:09:24,716
Say you'll share with me

1218
02:09:24,884 --> 02:09:30,847
One love, one lifetime

1219
02:09:31,015 --> 02:09:34,434
Say the word

1220
02:09:34,602 --> 02:09:40,607
And I will follow you

1221
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:47,197
Share each day with me

1222
02:09:47,365 --> 02:09:53,620
Each night, each morning

1223
02:09:54,413 --> 02:09:59,793
You alone can make my song

1224
02:09:59,961 --> 02:10:01,795
Take flight

1225
02:10:03,214 --> 02:10:05,966
It's over now

1226
02:10:06,133 --> 02:10:09,386
The music

1227
02:10:09,554 --> 02:10:15,851
Of the night
