1
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:24,570
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

2
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:27,989
Ooh-ooh-ooh

3
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:31,827
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

4
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:36,835
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,171
I was the third brother of five

6
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:44,927
Doing whatever I had to do
to survive

7
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:49,140
I'm not saying
what I did was all right

8
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:53,396
Trying to break out of the ghetto
was a day-to-day fight

9
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:57,610
Been down so long gettin' up
didn't cross my mind

10
00:00:57,777 --> 00:01:02,576
But I knew there was a better way
of life and I was just trying to find

11
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:06,704
But you don't know what you'll do
until you're put under pressure

12
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:10,459
Across 110th Street
is a hell of a tester

13
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:14,299
Across 110th Street

14
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:19,054
Pimps trying to catch a woman
that's weak

15
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:23,061
Across 110th Street

16
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:27,813
Pushers won't let
the junkie go free

17
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:32,570
Across 110th Street

18
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,492
Woman trying to catch
a trick on the street

19
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:41,498
Ooh, baby
Across 110th Street

20
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:45,128
You can find it all
in the street

21
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:54,057
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

22
00:01:54,224 --> 00:02:00,524
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh, ah

23
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:02,106
- How are you doing?

24
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:07,323
I got one more thing I'd like to talk
to y'all about right now

25
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,162
Hey, brother
There's a better way out

26
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:15,419
Snorting that coke, shooting that dope
Man, you're copping out

27
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:19,713
Take my advice
It's either live or die

28
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:23,802
You got to be strong
if you want to survive

29
00:02:23,972 --> 00:02:28,103
The family
on the other side of town

30
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:33,024
Will catch hell
without a ghetto around

31
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:37,319
In every city you find
the same thing going down

32
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:40,699
Harlem is the capital
of every ghetto town

33
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:45,206
Let me sing it
Across 110th Street

34
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,377
Pimps trying to catch
a woman that's weak

35
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,841
Across 110th Street

36
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:57,679
Pushers won't let
the junkie go free

37
00:02:57,846 --> 00:03:02,645
Oh, across 110th Street

38
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:05,900
A woman's trying to catch
a trick on the street

39
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:11,239
Ooh, baby
Across 110th Street

40
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:13,699
You can find it all

41
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:18,914
Ohh, ohh

42
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:22,127
Oh-oh
In the street

43
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:25,300
Yes, you can

44
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:28,885
Oh, look around you
look around you, look around you

45
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:32,140
Look around you
Yeah

46
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:36,396
Flight 710 to Cabo San Lucas
now boarding gate 103, first class only.

47
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:39,566
Flight 710, Cabo San Lucas,
now boarding gate 103.

48
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:42,194
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
First class only.

49
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:44,199
Buenos dias.

50
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:46,449
Welcome aboard.
Welcome aboard.

51
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,278
Hi, I'm Sidney. I'm a personal trainer
and Miss Orange County finalist.

52
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:18,908
This is my TEC-9.
That there is a TEC-9.

53
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:21,913
Little cheap-ass spray gun
made outta South Miami.

54
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,250
They retail for 380,
I get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800.

55
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:28,963
They advertise this TEC-9 as the most
popular gun in American crime.

56
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,425
Can you believe that shit? It actually says
that in the booklet that comes with it.

57
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:36,098
"The most popular gun in American crime".
Like they're proud of that shit.

58
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:38,933
I love my TEC-9.

59
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:41,646
Let me run this up.

60
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,149
Design emphasis behind this weapon.
Check out this gun here.

61
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:46,987
This here is a Styer Aug.

62
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:49,322
Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker. Listen.

63
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:54,829
Ooh! That shit's expensive too, man.

64
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,831
Made in Austria.

65
00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:00,002
My customers don't know shit about it,
so there ain't no demand for it.

66
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,841
Baby, I really could use me
some more ice.

67
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:08,346
Hold up.

68
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:12,476
Let me tell you,
though, man.

69
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:15,562
You put this bad boy in a flick,
every motherfucker out there want one.

70
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,776
I'm serious as a heart attack.

71
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,362
When them Hong Kong flicks came out, every nigger
in the world had to have a .45.

72
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:23,408
And they ain't want one,
they want two...

73
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,411
'cause all them niggers
want to be the killer.

74
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,829
But what them flicks don't tell you
and what they don't know...

75
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:30,665
is that a .45 got a serious
fuckin' jammin' problem.

76
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:33,168
Now, I try to steer my customers
toward a 9 millimetre...

77
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:36,507
'cause it's damn near the same weapon
and it ain't got half the jammin' problems.

78
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:39,927
But you know how them niggers is out there.
You can't tell 'em shit.

79
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:44,268
They want a .45. The killer had a .45,
they want a .45.

80
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:48,187
- Thanks, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:50,024
Who's your partner?

82
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:52,946
Cat named Mr Walker. Runs a fishing
boat outta Mexico.

83
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:57,201
I get the merchandise to him, he gets it out to my
customers, on all my bulk sales anyway.

84
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:01,540
Before I set that nigger up, he didn't have a pot
to piss in or a window to throw it out of.

85
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:04,793
Now that motherfucker
rollin' in cash.

86
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:08,130
Got hisself a yacht with all kind
of high-tech navigational shit on it.

87
00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:11,302
Oh, uh-uh-uh,
here we go.

88
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:15,725
AK-47, the very best there is.

89
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:20,521
When you absolutely, positively got to
kill every motherfucker in the room...

90
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,524
accept no substitutes.

91
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:26,569
Nothing gets
between me and my AK.

92
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:29,158
This here is the Chinese model.

93
00:06:29,324 --> 00:06:32,370
I get 'em for 850 and double my money.

94
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:34,374
Grab that for me, would ya, baby?

95
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,752
You know it's for you.

96
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:39,920
Girl, don't make me put my foot
in your ass.

97
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,259
The AK-47 is the most popular assault
rifle in the world.

98
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:48,889
This is the Chinese model. You can tell
by the extra rivets running through

99
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:53,273
Hello. It's for you.

100
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:07,247
Yo, Junebug. What's up?

101
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:13,422
Yep. Still hanging with
that stripper Chantelle?

102
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:15,425
Boring, isn't it?

103
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:18,721
I can sit through it once.

104
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,764
Thinks he's Joe Gunn now.

105
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:23,603
Well, I'm impressed.
He seems to know a lot.

106
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:26,398
He's just repeating shit
he overheard.

107
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:28,524
He ain't any more
of a gun expert than I am.

108
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:31,778
- You want?
- Sure.

109
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:35,115
It shoots 500 rounds of full
metal jacket...

110
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:39,038
9-millimetre Luger
at 1,270 feet per second.

111
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:42,125
At ten pounds, it's really heavy
for such a small gun.

112
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:44,463
Demi Moore.

113
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,797
Really reduce muzzle lights
during firing.

114
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,932
I've never held anything
that felt so strong.

115
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,478
So when'd you get out of jail?

116
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,480
Four days ago.

117
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,651
- Where at?
- Susanville.

118
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,901
How long?

119
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:07,322
About two months shy of four years.

120
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,826
Four years?

121
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:12,790
- For what?
- Bank robbery.

122
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:14,793
Really?

123
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,798
- Hi. Later.
- Shit, I'm impressed.

124
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,720
Ha-ha. See what
I'm talking about?

125
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:25,305
Now, that was about
a man in New York...

126
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:29,228
wants a 9-millimetre
Smith and Wesson, model 5946.

127
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:31,356
And why does he want it?

128
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:34,192
'Cause it's the same gun that nigger
on New York Undercover uses.

129
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,780
'Cause of that nigger, I'm gonna make
1,250 off of this nigger.

130
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:40,365
So, what's your cost?

131
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:43,370
Low as two.

132
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:46,081
- You're serious?
I'm telling you, Louis.

133
00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:49,543
Start adding these figures up, tell me
this ain't the business to be in.

134
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:11,697
- Oh, I got me five M-60 machine guns too.
- Hello.

135
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:14,243
Motherfuckers come straight
out the Gulf War.

136
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:16,870
I already sold 3 of them,
20 grand a piece.

137
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:20,710
- Wow, that's good money.
- I'm gonna make a million dollars out of this, man.

138
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:23,423
I already got a half million
sittin' down in Mexico.

139
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:27,010
When I deliver this next load,
it'll get me another half mil.

140
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:29,011
- Then what?
- Then I'm out.

141
00:09:29,178 --> 00:09:31,764
Spend the rest of my life spending.

142
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:34,434
Pull the trigger and let her rip!

143
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,109
Hi, my name is Huanita.

144
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:48,787
- Well, you gonna tell me who it is?
- It's Beaumont.

145
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:56,463
Don't clown on me, bitch.

146
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,638
Beaumont, what's up?

147
00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:04,221
What the fuck you doin' in jail?

148
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:06,769
What the fuck you doin' that for?

149
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:10,563
Goddamn, nigger.

150
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,735
Ain't you got better sense than to be
drunk driving with a goddamn pistol?

151
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:16,740
Beaumont.

152
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,787
Beaumont.

153
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,957
Listen to me. Yeah, number one,
you gots to chill.

154
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,001
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'course you're scared.

155
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,338
That's what the motherfuckers get
paid for, to scare the shit out of you.

156
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:31,423
That's their motherfucking job.

157
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,635
The judge doesn't give
a fuck about that.

158
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:36,639
He's ready to habitualize you.
Is that what you want?

159
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:38,850
You wanna look at ten years?

160
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:43,524
Tomorrow I'll get you out, I promise, but that
means I gotta pick you up tonight.

161
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,025
Reggie, there ain't
no two ways about it.

162
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:49,822
You're gonna spend the night in jail, but
I already told you I'm gonna get you out tomorrow.

163
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,245
Now, where are you?
You're at your mother's?

164
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:56,246
Put your mother on.

165
00:10:56,413 --> 00:11:00,586
Miss Gilmore. Miss Gilmore,
this is Max Cherry.

166
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:03,631
This is Reggie's...
That's right, his bail bondsman.

167
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:07,136
Look, Reggie is in big trouble.

168
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:10,642
I want to pick him up, and I want you
to be responsible for him before I...

169
00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:12,644
Sit down.

170
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:15,980
Yeah, I'd like you to make sure
that he's there when I get there.

171
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,360
And look, this is a second chance
for him.

172
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,779
They don't get...
That's correct.

173
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:26,745
All right. So I'm counting on you
to help me help your son.

174
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:30,042
Thank you very much.
Put him back on the line, please.

175
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,921
All right, Reggie, we're clear on this.
You got it? Good.

176
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:39,510
Do yourself a really big favour
and be there when I get there.

177
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:43,433
How can I help you?

178
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,105
Where can I put my ash?

179
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,524
Use that cup there, if you like.

180
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,948
Oh, and I need me a bond for 10,000.

181
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:59,620
- You all right out there?
- Yeah.

182
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:02,499
- Have some coffee?
- Go right ahead.

183
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:05,961
Who's that big, Mandingo-looking nigger you got
up there on that picture with you?

184
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:09,090
- That's Winston. He works here.
- Damn!

185
00:12:09,256 --> 00:12:11,927
He's a big 'un, ain't he?
Y'all tight?

186
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:15,057
- Yeah.
- But you're his boss, though, right?

187
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:16,808
Yeah.

188
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:19,645
Bet it was your idea to take that
picture, too, wasn't it?

189
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,735
All right, you wanna a $10000 bond.

190
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:28,697
- What have you got to put up for collateral?
- I'm gonna have to use cash.

191
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:33,038
- You have it with you?
- Got it right here in my rapper bag.

192
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:36,209
- You have cash. What do you need me for?
- Come on, man.

193
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:38,461
You know how they do.

194
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,340
Black man show up with 10,000 cash, first
thing they wanna know is where I got it.

195
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:45,888
Then they gonna want to keep a big chunk of
it, start talkin' that court cost shit.

196
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:48,558
Fuck that noise, Jack. I go through you.

197
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:51,059
Cost you a thousand for the bond.

198
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,815
I can do that.

199
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,109
Who's it for? A relative?

200
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,570
A fellow named Beaumont.
They got him down in County.

201
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:01,991
Started out drunk driving, but they wrote
it up as possession of a concealed weapon.

202
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:05,913
- Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
- Ten thousand sounds high.

203
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,832
They run his name, got a hit.
He'd been inside.

204
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:11,419
Plus, he's from Kentucky, and I
think they're kind of prejudiced...

205
00:13:11,586 --> 00:13:14,506
against brothers from down
South out here.

206
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:17,886
If he runs, and I have to go to
Kentucky to bring him back...

207
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:19,889
you pay the expenses.

208
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:22,225
You think you can do that?

209
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:26,065
I've done it.
What's his full name?

210
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:28,900
Beaumont. That's all I know.

211
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:34,615
Would you say that Beaumont is his
first or his last name?

212
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:38,370
Uh, if I had to guess, I'd say Beaumont's
his Christian name.

213
00:13:38,538 --> 00:13:41,582
Records office.

214
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:46,631
Hello, this is Max Cherry, Cherry Bail Bonds.
Who's this, please?

215
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:49,592
- Ordell, I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Hi, Vicki.

216
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,681
All right, man. Cool.
We're almost done here, right?

217
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:55,558
- Gettin' there.
- Yo, yo.

218
00:13:55,726 --> 00:13:59,523
You check out some music while you're
sitting in the car. Take the keys.

219
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:02,777
- Which one's for the car?
- Uh, this one right here.

220
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:06,407
Use that little black thing to turn off
the alarm and unlock the door.

221
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:08,741
- What do I do?
- You ain't gotta do nothing, man.

222
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:11,413
Just point it at the car, push the button,
you hear a little "ooh-ooh-ooh".

223
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:13,164
That means the door's unlocked
and the alarm's off. Get in.

224
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:14,207
Okay.

225
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:18,672
Play the volume loud as you want to,
but don't touch my levels now.

226
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:21,217
- I got them set just like I like 'em.
- Okay.

227
00:14:32,774 --> 00:14:34,984
Beaumont Livingston.

228
00:14:35,152 --> 00:14:37,196
Livingston, huh?

229
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:41,743
On his prior, he served nine months.
He's working on four years' probation.

230
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:45,040
- You don't say.
- You know what he's on probation for?

231
00:14:45,206 --> 00:14:49,796
- Ain't got a clue.
- Possession of unregistered machine guns.

232
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:54,134
Damn. Now, they're gonna consider
that a violation of his probation?

233
00:14:54,302 --> 00:14:57,679
They do consider this
a violation of his probation.

234
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,393
- Your boy's looking at ten years...
- Mm.

235
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,559
plus the concealed weapon.

236
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:07,985
He ain't gonna like that. Beaumont ain't
got a doing-time kind of disposition.

237
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:12,826
- I need your name and address.
- Ordell Robbie.

238
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,951
O-R-D-E-L-L...

239
00:15:15,118 --> 00:15:17,162
R-O-B-B-I-E.

240
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:19,833
1436 Florence Boulevard...

241
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,461
Compton, 90222.

242
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:28,927
- Is that a house or an apartment?
- That's a house.

243
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:36,520
Who the fuck is this?

244
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:39,692
It's your benefactor, nigger.
I'm comin' up.

245
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:42,363
Come on up, nigger.
It's open.

246
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:44,740
My pleasure of living...

247
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:48,370
demands that I have a good-looking woman,
that I'm with a good-looking woman.

248
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:51,207
I couldn't go out with a woman
old enough to be my wife.

249
00:15:51,374 --> 00:15:54,378
- O.D.!
- Ah-ha-ha!

250
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:57,423
- Look at you and your free ass.
- What's up, man?

251
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,719
Come here, boy.
Give me a motherfuckin' hug.

252
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:02,889
- I didn't know you were coming by.
- Yeah.

253
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:04,893
My nigger.

254
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:07,726
Good lookin' out, man. I don't know
what to say. Thank you, thank you.

255
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:10,398
- Uh-huh. Who was there for your ass, huh?
- You was there.

256
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:12,399
- Who? Who? Who?
- You. You, nigger. You.

257
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:15,279
You goddamn right. See?
That's how that shit works.

258
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,865
You get your ass in trouble,
I get your ass out.

259
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:23,289
That's my motherfucking job. And I don't mind
telling you, nigger, it's steady work.

260
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:26,875
Hey, look here, man, I'm still
scared as a motherfucker, O.D.

261
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:28,879
They talkin' like they
serious as hell...

262
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:30,883
givin' me time for
that machine gun shit.

263
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:33,427
Oh, come on, man. They're just
trying to put a fright in your ass.

264
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:35,429
If that's what they're doin',
they done did it.

265
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:39,184
- How old is that machine gun shit, huh?
- About three years.

266
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:41,852
Three years? Come on, man,
that's an old crime, man.

267
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,860
They ain't got room in the joint for all
these niggers out here killing people now.

268
00:16:45,027 --> 00:16:46,610
How they gonna
find room for you?

269
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:49,113
That ain't what
they're telling me.

270
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,994
That's why they call it "fuckin' with you". Now,
let me tell you how we're going to retaliate.

271
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:56,957
All right? Tomorrow I'm gonna pick you
up, take you over to Century City...

272
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,168
introduce you to my lawyer.

273
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:03,631
Let me tell you something about my lawyer.
This brother's name is Stacin Goins.

274
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,635
This nigger is a junkyard dog.

275
00:17:05,803 --> 00:17:08,137
He my own personal Johnny Cochran.

276
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:10,642
Matter of fact, he kicked
Johnny Cochran's ass.

277
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:14,229
And like Johnny Cochran, this nigger
hate cops. I'm serious, man.

278
00:17:14,396 --> 00:17:16,897
He live to fuck
with the police.

279
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:19,902
Now, as a favour, I had him
look at your case.

280
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:23,448
He say you ain't got shit to worry about.
They're just fuckin' with you.

281
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:29,455
So we're gonna sic the junkyard dog on their
ass and make 'em stop fuckin' with you.

282
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,711
- Good lookin' out, man. Good lookin' out.
- Hmm? Mm-hmm.

283
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:34,546
- Come on in, man, and let's celebrate.
- No, no. Uh-uh.

284
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:37,049
Look here, I'm really
supposed to be somewhere.

285
00:17:37,218 --> 00:17:41,096
Matter of fact, I was kind of hoping
you could come run with me.

286
00:17:41,262 --> 00:17:43,098
What you mean?

287
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:45,102
You know, man.

288
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:48,105
I hate to be the kind of nigger
that do a nigger a favour...

289
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:50,482
then bam, hit the nigger up
for a favour in return...

290
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:52,612
but I gots to be
that kind of nigger.

291
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:55,990
- What? What you want?
- I need a favour, nigger.

292
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,994
- That requires me to go out tonight?
- Just a bit.

293
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,914
Aw, man, I wasn't plannin'
on goin' no place tonight.

294
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,628
It is late as hell, man.
I'm home, I'm high, man. Come on.

295
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:08,298
Uh- huh.
And why are you home, huh?

296
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:12,678
You home because I spent $10,000
to get your ass home.

297
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:16,683
Now, look, I got
a little problem, all right?

298
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:19,185
I need some help,
and you can help me out.

299
00:18:19,354 --> 00:18:21,816
Go in the house and throw some shit on.
Let's walk out to the car.

300
00:18:21,982 --> 00:18:23,818
Come on.

301
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:28,990
- I'm ready, man. What's your problem?
- There ain't no problem.

302
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:31,201
It's more like a situation.

303
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:35,415
You remember them three M-60 machine guns
I sold last year outta the five I got?

304
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:38,377
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.

305
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:43,050
There's this group of Koreans over in Koreatown
startin' this Neighbourhood Watch thing.

306
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:47,346
They need some weapons so they can show the
neighbourhood niggers they mean business.

307
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:51,394
Now, I'm gonna sell them the other
two machine guns, all right?

308
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:54,816
The problem is, I ain't never done
business with these Koreans before.

309
00:18:54,982 --> 00:18:57,819
I ain't worried, 'cause by and large
Asians are very dependable.

310
00:18:57,987 --> 00:18:59,822
They don't want no trouble.

311
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:02,032
You might argue with them
about price and shit...

312
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:04,368
but you ain't gotta worry
about them shootin' you in the back.

313
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:06,663
But I got me a rule:

314
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,502
Never do business with people you ain't never
done business with before without backup.

315
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,172
That's why I need you.
Backup.

316
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:18,260
Look, all you've got to do is lay in
here and hold on to this motherfucker.

317
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:21,722
All right? I'm gonna tell 'em I'm goin'
in the trunk to show 'em the goods.

318
00:19:21,891 --> 00:19:24,730
When I open the trunk, you pop up
and rack this motherfucker.

319
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,732
Man, fuck that shit.
I ain't fixin' to shootin' nobody.

320
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:28,733
I ain't said nothin'
about you shootin' nobody.

321
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,363
All you gotta do is hold on to it.
They'll get the idea.

322
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:34,907
You must be out of your mind if you think
I'm gonna get in this dirty-ass trunk.

323
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:37,201
We ain't goin' nowhere
but to Koreatown, man.

324
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:39,371
You ain't gonna be in here
no more than ten minutes.

325
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,211
I ain't ridin' in no trunk for no minute.
Why can't I ride up front with you?

326
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:46,213
You can't ride up front with me.
The surprise element is 90% of it.

327
00:19:46,382 --> 00:19:49,760
I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
gettin' in no goddamn trunk.

328
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:52,597
- I can't believe you'd do me like this.
- Do you like what, man?

329
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:55,934
I just ain't climbing in no goddamn,
dirty-ass trunk, man.

330
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:59,732
- I got a problem with small places.
- I got a problem to spend $10000 on ungrateful

331
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,234
niggers to get them out of jail...

332
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:03,153
but I did it.

333
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,363
How small was that jail cell,
motherfucker?

334
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,574
- I know I owe you, you got to bring all this up.
- Then get your ass in this trunk.

335
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:12,789
I want to help you, but I won't be locked
in no goddamn trunk of no car.

336
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,376
You think I wanted to spend $10000
on your ass, huh?

337
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:18,631
I know you helped me out.

338
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:21,092
- Yes or no?
- Of course you didn't, but look, in the trunk?

339
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:24,346
That's the only way I could help you,
right? So that's what I did.

340
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:28,017
Now, look, man, all I'm asking you
to do is get in the trunk...

341
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:31,270
hold this fuckin' shotgun, point it at these
Buddha-heads when I open it, all right?

342
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:35,277
- You're catching a nigger off-guard with this shit.
- Look here. I tell you what.

343
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,654
When we get through fucking
with these Koreans...

344
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:41,202
me and you go to Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles on me.

345
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:43,204
Think about it now.

346
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,333
That 'Scoe's Special,
smothered in gravy and onions...

347
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,005
side of red beans and rice,
some greens.

348
00:20:50,172 --> 00:20:52,423
That's some good eatin'.

349
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,010
Man.

350
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:02,311
Exactly how long do I gotta
be in this motherfucker?

351
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:06,316
Hey, you said ten minutes. Hey, motherfucker,
you hit my goddamn head!

352
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,694
You ponytail-wearing motherfucker.

353
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:11,698
What the hell's wrong with you?

354
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:42,903
Hello, my love
I heard a kiss from you

355
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:45,532
Red magic satin
playin' near

356
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:48,162
Too

357
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:50,875
All through the morning rain
I gave

358
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,542
The sun doesn't shine

359
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,758
Rainbows and waterfalls
run through my mind

360
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:01,510
In the garden I see

361
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:04,098
West purple
shower bells and tea

362
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:09,230
Orange birds and river cousins
Dressed in green

363
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:12,106
Pretty music I hear

364
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:14,778
So happy and loud

365
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:03,257
Do a nigger a favour...

366
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:23,657
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

367
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:27,371
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

368
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:33,921
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

369
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:37,215
Ooh, ooh

370
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:40,430
Baby love
my baby love

371
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:44,727
I need you
Oh, how I need you

372
00:23:44,894 --> 00:23:47,730
But all you do
is treat me bad

373
00:23:47,897 --> 00:23:51,818
Break my heart
and make me sad

374
00:23:51,987 --> 00:23:54,820
Tell me what did I do wrong

375
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:58,159
To make you stay away so long

376
00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:01,622
'Cause baby love
my baby love

377
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:06,171
I'm missin' you
Miss kissin' you

378
00:24:06,337 --> 00:24:08,673
Instead of breakin' up
Excuse me, baby.

379
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,137
Let's do some kissin' and makin' up

380
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:15,141
Don't throw our love away

381
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:19,479
In my arms why don't you stay

382
00:24:19,646 --> 00:24:23,401
Hello.
Need ya, need ya

383
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:26,320
Hello, baby.
Baby love

384
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:30,492
Well, you know, I'm just doin'
that thing I do, baby.

385
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:37,126
Oh, no. Okay. Hold on.

386
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:43,425
Uh, Louis, baby. It's Ordell.

387
00:24:43,593 --> 00:24:45,760
Oh, I'm just gonna go pee.

388
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,432
Separate, my love

389
00:24:48,598 --> 00:24:51,686
All of my
whole life through

390
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:54,021
I never loved no one but you
Hello.

391
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,026
Louis, my man.
What ya doin'?

392
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:58,654
Okay. Okay.
I'm just hanging out with Simone.

393
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:00,949
Oh, yeah?
She doin' her show for you?

394
00:25:01,115 --> 00:25:02,866
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

395
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:06,288
I can hear the Supremes in
the background. She ain't bad, is she?

396
00:25:06,455 --> 00:25:09,042
- No, she's pretty good.
- She do Mary Wells for you yet?

397
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,380
Nah, I don't know the names of everybody,
but she's done a whole bunch of them.

398
00:25:12,548 --> 00:25:14,384
Uh-huh.
Well, guess where I am?

399
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:16,468
I don't know.

400
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:19,221
I'm in the cosy confines
of an Oldsmobile...

401
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:21,473
parked right outside
Simone's house.

402
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:23,518
- Oh, you're outside?
- Yeah.

403
00:25:23,685 --> 00:25:25,521
- Come on in.
- Ah, no, man.

404
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:27,691
I already caught that show.

405
00:25:27,857 --> 00:25:31,903
I got some for-your-eyes-only shit to
show you. Why don't you step outside?

406
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,625
- Who was that?
- That's Beaumont.

407
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,627
Who's Beaumont?

408
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:46,464
An employee I had to let go.

409
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:55,517
What'd he do?

410
00:25:55,685 --> 00:26:00,148
He put hisself in a position where he was
gonna have to do ten years in prison.

411
00:26:00,316 --> 00:26:02,234
That's what he did.

412
00:26:02,403 --> 00:26:04,321
And if you know Beaumont...

413
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:08,286
you know there ain't no goddamn way
he can do ten years.

414
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:13,124
If you know that, then you know Beaumont's
gonna do anything Beaumont can...

415
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,584
to keep from doin'
them ten years...

416
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:19,382
includin' tellin' the federal government
any and every motherfucking thing...

417
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:21,801
about my black ass.

418
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,888
Now, that, my friend,
is a clear-cut case...

419
00:26:25,056 --> 00:26:27,099
of him or me...

420
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:29,393
and you best believe...

421
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,897
it ain't gonna be me.

422
00:26:34,234 --> 00:26:36,070
Now, Louis...

423
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,619
if you gonna come in
on this thing with me...

424
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:44,664
you've got to
be prepared...

425
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:47,500
to go all the way.

426
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:50,587
Now, I got me, so far, a half
million dollars in lock boxes...

427
00:26:50,755 --> 00:26:53,758
in a bank down
in Cabo San Lucas.

428
00:26:53,924 --> 00:26:56,261
I make this delivery...

429
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,015
I'm gonna have me
over a million.

430
00:26:59,182 --> 00:27:03,689
Hey, you think I'm gonna let a little
cheese-eatin' nigger like this fuck that up?

431
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,316
You best think again.

432
00:27:06,482 --> 00:27:09,319
Before I let that happen,
I'll shoot this nigger in the head...

433
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:11,823
and ten niggers
look just like him.

434
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:14,743
You understand
what I'm saying?

435
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:17,205
Yeah.

436
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:21,500
- So we on the same page then?
- Yeah, I follow.

437
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:28,344
My nigger.

438
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,608
Miss Brown!

439
00:27:40,777 --> 00:27:43,615
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargas,
L.A.P.D.

440
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:46,951
- Can I ask what you have in that bag?
- The usual stuff.

441
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:49,663
You know, I'm a flight attendant
for Cabo Air.

442
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,750
- Can I help out here?
- Who's this?

443
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:56,171
Sorry, this is Special Agent Ray Nicolet
with Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

444
00:27:56,337 --> 00:27:59,758
- Oh, yeah? May I see some I.D.?
- Yeah. Sure.

445
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:04,266
Would you mind if we just
took a look in that bag?

446
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,102
Do I mind?
Do I have a choice?

447
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,105
- Yeah. You have the right to say no.
- No.

448
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,692
I have the right to make you wait here
with Ray while I go get a warrant.

449
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,696
If I don't want to go to all that trouble,
I'd just take you in on suspicion now.

450
00:28:15,864 --> 00:28:19,535
- Suspicion of what?
- Uh, could I say something?

451
00:28:19,702 --> 00:28:22,288
He just wants to peek
inside the bag for a minute.

452
00:28:22,454 --> 00:28:25,875
I'll keep my eye on him
so he doesn't take anything.

453
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:29,047
- Go ahead.
- Thanks a lot.

454
00:28:29,212 --> 00:28:32,968
Bad knees.

455
00:28:33,134 --> 00:28:36,221
You have a good flight?

456
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:39,976
It's a shitty flight down to Cabo. I went
down there one time with Susan, my wife.

457
00:28:40,144 --> 00:28:42,730
Fuckin' turbulence
was unbelievable.

458
00:28:45,984 --> 00:28:48,570
Hey, can I look
in this envelope?

459
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:56,080
Ah.

460
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,923
Goddamn.

461
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,048
I'd say there's
about, oh, uh...

462
00:29:04,215 --> 00:29:06,720
$50,000 here.

463
00:29:06,886 --> 00:29:09,097
What would you say, Ray?

464
00:29:09,263 --> 00:29:12,935
Looks like about 50,000
from here.

465
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,277
- Is this your money?
- What if I say no?

466
00:29:18,443 --> 00:29:21,946
You should know if you bring in anything
over 10,000, you have to declare it.

467
00:29:22,114 --> 00:29:24,617
You forget, or what?

468
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:29,123
You can get a $250,000 fine,
plus two years in prison.

469
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,878
You want to talk to us about this,
or do you want to talk to Customs?

470
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:35,256
- I'm not sayin' another word.
- Jackie...

471
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:38,176
I hope you don't mind
if I call you Jackie.

472
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:42,098
Those guys down in Customs? They're a bunch of
pricks. Excuse me, but they are.

473
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:46,770
There's something about that job makes
those people really hard to get along with.

474
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:49,273
You can go down and talk
with those guys...

475
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:52,694
who are really suspicious and
really disagreeable human beings...

476
00:29:52,862 --> 00:29:57,701
or you can talk with a couple of
good-hearted guys like Mark and myself.

477
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:01,249
It's up to you.

478
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:07,631
Let's take a look here
at the file on Jacqueline Brown.

479
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:11,470
According to this, this isn't the
first time you've run afoul of the law.

480
00:30:11,636 --> 00:30:14,722
In 1985,
while a stewardess for Delta...

481
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,974
you were busted
while carrying drugs for a pilot?

482
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:19,479
That pilot was my husband,
and I got off.

483
00:30:19,646 --> 00:30:22,148
You mean they offered you a deal,
and you grabbed it.

484
00:30:22,316 --> 00:30:26,070
He did time; you did probation.

485
00:30:26,238 --> 00:30:29,198
I didn't hear you ask permission
to smoke in my office.

486
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:31,660
- May I smoke?
- No, you may not.

487
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:34,164
So you get off
with a slap on the wrist...

488
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,671
but all this criminal activity fucks up your
shit for good with the big airlines.

489
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,634
Cut to 13 years later,
you're 44 years of age...

490
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:47,012
flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fuckin'
piece of shit Mexican airline there is...

491
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,267
where you make what,
$13000 a year?

492
00:30:49,768 --> 00:30:52,520
I make 16,000,
plus benefits.

493
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:56,778
You been in the service industry 19 years, and all
you make is 16,000, plus benefits?

494
00:30:56,943 --> 00:31:01,575
Didn't exactly set the world on fire,
did you, Jackie?

495
00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:03,702
Jackie, you have a good lawyer?

496
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:06,329
Can she afford
a good one, is more like it.

497
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,709
Otherwise you'll be
in Sybil Brand three weeks...

498
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:12,546
before the public defender
gets around to ya.

499
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:18,346
Hey, Jackie, do you know a guy
named Beaumont Livingston?

500
00:31:18,512 --> 00:31:21,557
Yeah? No?

501
00:31:21,723 --> 00:31:24,060
Because he knows you.

502
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:26,147
Well, he knew you.

503
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:28,858
He doesn't know anybody now.
He's dead.

504
00:31:29,026 --> 00:31:32,028
They found him in a trunk
of a car this morning...

505
00:31:32,197 --> 00:31:34,282
shot twice.

506
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,078
Once in the chest,
once in the head.

507
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:40,538
Here you go.
So I guess I'm wondering.

508
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:43,044
If you don't know Beaumont...

509
00:31:45,713 --> 00:31:49,551
how do you suppose Beaumont
knows you?

510
00:31:52,474 --> 00:31:57,270
Look, Miss Brown,
we don't give a fuck about you.

511
00:31:57,438 --> 00:31:59,440
You know who we want.

512
00:31:59,605 --> 00:32:03,109
If you cooperate, tell us what we want
to know, we'll help you get out of this.

513
00:32:03,277 --> 00:32:07,199
If you refuse to cooperate, continue to
cop a shit attitude like you're doing now...

514
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:10,287
we will give you to Customs
and they will take you to court.

515
00:32:10,453 --> 00:32:12,914
With your prior, the judge
will give you two years.

516
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,545
Now, you'll probably only end up
serving a year and some change...

517
00:32:16,712 --> 00:32:19,548
but if I was
a 44-year-old black woman...

518
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:24,136
desperately clinging on to this one shitty,
little job I was fortunate enough to get...

519
00:32:24,305 --> 00:32:27,183
I don't think that I'd think
I had a year to throw away.

520
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:30,810
So let's start again now,
shall we?

521
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:35,318
Who in Mexico gave you this money, and who
in America were you bringing it to?

522
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:39,074
I'm not sayin'
another goddamn word.

523
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:50,546
I'd like your permission to look through this again
so we'll know how much we're talking about.

524
00:32:50,712 --> 00:32:53,383
Sure. Go ahead.

525
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:59,392
While we're at it,
let's see what else is in there.

526
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:01,394
Do you mind?

527
00:33:05,273 --> 00:33:06,942
Beauty case.

528
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:09,694
- Mm-hmm. What's in it?
- Beauty products.

529
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,701
Alarm clock.

530
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,036
Glass case.

531
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:19,210
Birth control.

532
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,964
- What's that?
- My diet shit.

533
00:33:25,132 --> 00:33:27,468
Let's see what else
is in there.

534
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:31,307
Here. Here. Here.

535
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,939
- What's this?
- What's that shit?

536
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,153
Let's go, ladies.
First door on the left.

537
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:45,325
Ninety-nine years
is a long, long, long time

538
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:49,913
Ninety-nine years is such
a long, long, long time

539
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:54,171
Ninety-nine years
is a long, long time

540
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:56,503
Well, look at me

541
00:33:56,673 --> 00:33:59,674
I'll never be free

542
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:02,846
I'm a long-time woman

543
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:09,773
Brown, case 70032.

544
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,818
The charge is...

545
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:18,032
possession of narcotics
with the intent to distribute.

546
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:22,329
- How does your client plead?
- Uh, Your Honour, she wishes to stand mute.

547
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:24,333
Very well.

548
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,211
Detective... Varga.

549
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:29,463
- Dargas, Your Honour.
- Sorry.

550
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:32,675
Uh, you were the arresting officer
in this case?

551
00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:35,722
- That's correct, Your Honour.
- And do you have a bail recommendation?

552
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,224
- Yes, I do, Your Honour.
- And that would be?

553
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:40,978
Based on the defendant's
prior conviction...

554
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:43,731
and the extreme possibility
of flight due to the occupation...

555
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,320
the state requests a bond
of no less than 25,000.

556
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:49,155
The People are fine with this?

557
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:01,380
I'm gonna set bond at 10,000...

558
00:35:01,547 --> 00:35:04,385
and set the date
of August 21...

559
00:35:04,552 --> 00:35:06,469
for the prelim.

560
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,472
Your Honour,
when will that be?

561
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,726
That's six weeks from now.
We'll continue this matter then.

562
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:16,648
Owens, case 72242.

563
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:19,195
The charge is possession
of a concealed weapon...

564
00:35:19,362 --> 00:35:22,240
and striking an officer.

565
00:35:22,407 --> 00:35:25,577
- How does your client plead?
- I thought it'd be 25.

566
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:30,248
Uh, my client would like to
plead guilty, Your Honour.

567
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:34,088
Is the arresting officer
here in the courtroom?

568
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:48,523
Uh-uh-uh.
I didn't hear you wash your hands.

569
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,652
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.

570
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,949
- Door was open, so I just come on in.
- I can see that.

571
00:35:57,117 --> 00:35:59,246
- Why?
- Got some more business for you.

572
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:01,454
Oh, yeah?
What did he do?

573
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:04,293
She is an airline stewardess.

574
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,088
Got caught coming back
from Mexico with some blow.

575
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,925
They set her bond this afternoon
at $10000.

576
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,137
Now, I'm figuring you could take that
$10000 you owe me from Beaumont...

577
00:36:14,932 --> 00:36:16,766
move it over
to the stewardess.

578
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,938
- The bond for possession's only a thousand.
- Hmm. Yeah.

579
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:24,277
Man, they fuckin' with her. They callin'
that shit "possession with intent".

580
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:27,530
A 44-year-old black woman
caught with less than two ounces...

581
00:36:27,697 --> 00:36:29,492
they calling that shit "intent".

582
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:33,371
The same thing happen to a movie star,
they call it "possession".

583
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:35,375
Still sounds high.

584
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:40,632
Well, um, she had on her,
I believe it was 50 grand in cash.

585
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:44,010
All right, before we start
talking about stewardesses...

586
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:46,306
let's get Beaumont
out of the way first.

587
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:48,556
You know, I think
somebody already did.

588
00:36:48,724 --> 00:36:51,146
- What?
- You ain't hear?

589
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:55,106
- Hear what?
- Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out.

590
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:58,112
Oh, shit.
That shit rhymes.

591
00:36:58,278 --> 00:37:00,197
Blew Beaumont's
brains out.

592
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,286
Police make contact
with you?

593
00:37:04,454 --> 00:37:07,873
Oh, hell, yeah.
First motherfucking thing they did.

594
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:10,545
You know, they see I pay
a big money bond for my boy...

595
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,548
they start thinking that "where there's
smoke there's fire" logic.

596
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:16,300
Rousted my ass out of bed
10:00 in the morning.

597
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,554
Scared the shit out
of my woman Sheronda.

598
00:37:18,722 --> 00:37:21,559
She thought they was gonna
take my ass away for sure.

599
00:37:21,726 --> 00:37:25,186
- This stewardess...
- You know her last name?

600
00:37:25,355 --> 00:37:29,025
Brown. Jackie Brown.

601
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:31,570
- What does she do for you?
- Who said she do anything for me?

602
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:35,199
She's my friend. My friends get
in trouble, I like to help them out.

603
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:37,329
Beaumont worked for you.

604
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:40,873
This you and me talking,
like lawyer-client thing?

605
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,876
You can't tell nothing
I say to you?

606
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:46,382
You're not my client till you
get busted and I bond you out.

607
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:50,719
Well, we ain't got no, uh...
What you call that shit?

608
00:37:50,887 --> 00:37:52,722
Confidentiality.

609
00:37:52,891 --> 00:37:54,726
Why should I
tell you anything?

610
00:37:54,893 --> 00:37:57,230
'Cause you want me to know
what a slick guy you are.

611
00:37:57,396 --> 00:37:59,648
You got stewardesses
bringing you 50 grand.

612
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:02,985
And why would a stewardess
be bringing me 50 grand?

613
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:06,489
Now you want me to speculate
on what you do.

614
00:38:06,657 --> 00:38:11,121
I'd say you were in the drug business, except
the money's moving in the wrong direction.

615
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:16,043
Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting
away with it, so, uh, more power to you.

616
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,755
All right.
You want another bond?

617
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,594
You want to move the 10,000 you got
on Beaumont over to the stewardess.

618
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,554
That means paperwork.

619
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:26,141
I gotta get a death certificate,
present it to the court...

620
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:29,728
make out a receipt for return of bond
collateral, type up another application...

621
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:31,858
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
...another indemnity agreement.

622
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:34,233
- Jackie ain't got time for this.
- I'm telling you what I have to do.

623
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,235
What you have to do,
in case you forgot...

624
00:38:36,403 --> 00:38:39,489
is come up with a premium of a thousand bucks.
- I can do that.

625
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:42,496
You know I got the money.
I just ain't got it with me.

626
00:38:42,663 --> 00:38:45,081
Come back when you do.
I'll bond out the stewardess.

627
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:49,170
Look, you got to look at this
with a little compassion, all right?

628
00:38:49,336 --> 00:38:52,423
Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't
used to this kind of treatment.

629
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,344
Gangsters don't give a fuck,
but your average citizen...

630
00:38:55,512 --> 00:38:58,349
a couple of nights in County
get to fuckin' with their mind.

631
00:38:58,514 --> 00:39:00,768
Ordell, this isn't a bar.
You don't have a tab.

632
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:02,936
Listen to me, all right?

633
00:39:03,105 --> 00:39:07,442
You got a 44-year-old, gainfully employed
black woman falsely accused...

634
00:39:07,608 --> 00:39:11,197
Falsely accused? She didn't come back
from Mexico with cocaine on her?

635
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:13,659
Falsely accused of "intent".

636
00:39:13,827 --> 00:39:17,121
If she had that shit...
and mind you, I'm saying if...

637
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,751
that was her own personal shit
to get high with.

638
00:39:19,918 --> 00:39:23,380
Is white guilt supposed to make me
forget I'm running a business?

639
00:39:26,384 --> 00:39:28,719
Oh, it's like that, huh?

640
00:39:33,643 --> 00:39:35,478
All right.

641
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:40,235
I got you a thousand bucks.

642
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:45,574
- Hey, Candy.
- Hey, Max.

643
00:39:45,742 --> 00:39:49,664
Dropping off Lopez, Anita.
Picking up Brown, Jackie.

644
00:39:49,831 --> 00:39:53,085
- Okay, no problem. You armed?
- You bet I am.

645
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:11,065
Max, here she comes.

646
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:52,827
Why do I keep my mind

647
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:57,583
On you all the time

648
00:40:57,751 --> 00:40:59,963
And I don't even know you

649
00:41:00,128 --> 00:41:03,007
I don't know you

650
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:10,181
Why do I feel this way

651
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:12,226
Thinking about you

652
00:41:12,393 --> 00:41:14,855
Every day

653
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:18,485
And I don't even know you

654
00:41:18,652 --> 00:41:21,030
Miss Brown?

655
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:23,617
Yes?
Take me in your arms

656
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:26,577
I'm Max Cherry. I'm your bail bondsman.
Thrill me with all

657
00:41:26,746 --> 00:41:30,583
I could give you a lift home, if you like.
Of your charms

658
00:41:30,751 --> 00:41:35,923
Okay
And I'll take to the sky on a natural high

659
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:40,262
Loving you more till the day I die
On a natural high

660
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:44,561
Take to the sky on a natural high
I want you to be mine

661
00:41:44,726 --> 00:41:49,231
Loving you more

662
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:54,655
If you have anything to do

663
00:41:54,822 --> 00:41:59,577
Call me and I
will do it for you

664
00:41:59,746 --> 00:42:03,125
You really a bail bondsman?

665
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:05,168
Well, who do you think I am?

666
00:42:05,336 --> 00:42:09,092
- I showed you my card in there.
- Can I see your I.D.?

667
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:11,760
You're serious?

668
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:16,682
That wish would be
for you to live

669
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:20,605
Forever and ever

670
00:42:20,773 --> 00:42:22,608
Who paid my bond?

671
00:42:22,775 --> 00:42:25,360
- Ordell?
- In cash.

672
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:32,121
My heart skips a beat

673
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:36,960
And I take to the sky on a naturaI high
I just take to the sky

674
00:42:37,126 --> 00:42:41,715
Loving you more till the day I die
On a natural high

675
00:42:41,884 --> 00:42:46,639
Take to the sky on a natural high
I don't know you

676
00:42:46,806 --> 00:42:51,061
Loving you more

677
00:42:57,695 --> 00:43:00,072
You got any cigarettes in here?

678
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,369
You won't find
any cigarettes in there.

679
00:43:05,206 --> 00:43:08,958
- Can we stop and get cigarettes?
- Sure.

680
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:11,586
Have you ever been
to the River Bottom?

681
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,675
- I don't think so.
- It's all right. It's a cop bar.

682
00:43:15,842 --> 00:43:19,262
Can we just stop
at a 7-Eleven or something?

683
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:23,018
- I thought you might like to have a drink.
- I'd love to, but not there.

684
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:27,106
How 'bout the Hilton
by the airport?

685
00:43:27,275 --> 00:43:30,528
- Is it dark?
- Kind of a sports bar.

686
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:33,532
It doesn't sound dark.

687
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:35,786
Why does it have to be dark?

688
00:43:35,952 --> 00:43:40,833
Because it looks like
I just got out of jail, that's why.

689
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,295
You're dropping me off at my place.
There's a joint near me.

690
00:43:54,434 --> 00:43:56,686
No, thanks.
I quit three years ago.

691
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:59,356
- Gain weight?
- Ten pounds.

692
00:43:59,523 --> 00:44:02,193
- Take it off and put it back on.

693
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,864
That's why I don't quit.

694
00:44:09,702 --> 00:44:11,539
Mm.

695
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:19,005
If I can't fly, I'm gonna have a bitch
of a time trying to find my brand.

696
00:44:22,302 --> 00:44:24,556
You know...

697
00:44:24,722 --> 00:44:28,351
the other day I figured out
that I must have written about...

698
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:32,023
15,000 bonds since I've been
in the business.

699
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,193
I figure about 80% of those
were drug- related, so...

700
00:44:36,362 --> 00:44:40,115
if you want, I could help you
figure out your options.

701
00:44:42,911 --> 00:44:45,331
So far, they told me
if I cooperate...

702
00:44:45,498 --> 00:44:49,003
then I'll get probation, maybe.

703
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,507
Or if I stand mute,
I can get as much as five years.

704
00:44:52,675 --> 00:44:54,842
Does that sound right?

705
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:58,889
I'd say that if they try you and convict you,
you won't get more than a year and a day.

706
00:44:59,057 --> 00:45:01,101
That's state time, prison.

707
00:45:01,268 --> 00:45:03,438
But they won't
want to do that.

708
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:06,525
They'll offer you simple possession,
a couple of months of county time...

709
00:45:06,693 --> 00:45:09,612
and a year or two
of probation.

710
00:45:09,778 --> 00:45:12,907
Do you happen to know
who put the dope in your bag?

711
00:45:13,074 --> 00:45:15,496
Yeah.

712
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:19,000
But that's not
what this is about.

713
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:21,585
They were waiting for my ass.

714
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:23,588
They knew about the money.

715
00:45:23,757 --> 00:45:27,217
- They even knew the exact amount.
- What did they want to know?

716
00:45:27,385 --> 00:45:30,222
Who gave me the money
and who I was givin' it to.

717
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:33,851
They found this guy in the trunk
of a car with his head blown off.

718
00:45:34,018 --> 00:45:36,273
They said it was him
who told them about me.

719
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,443
That would be...
Beaumont Livingston.

720
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:43,114
How do you know about him?

721
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,951
I wrote him on Monday.
They found him dead on Tuesday.

722
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:51,791
Ordell pick up his bond?

723
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:55,711
Same as you... $10,000.

724
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,467
Back about 18 and 25

725
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:03,139
I left Tennessee
very much alive

726
00:46:03,306 --> 00:46:05,559
- Thanks for the drink.
- You're welcome.

727
00:46:05,726 --> 00:46:08,478
- The legal advice and the ride.
- You bet.

728
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:13,110
Good luck. We'll be in touch.
On a Tennessee stud

729
00:46:13,277 --> 00:46:17,490
Had some trouble
with my sweetheart's pa

730
00:46:17,657 --> 00:46:21,077
One of her brothers
was a bad outlaw

731
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:24,583
I wrote a letter
to my Uncle Fudd

732
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:28,838
And I rode away
on a Tennessee stud

733
00:46:29,005 --> 00:46:32,844
The Tennessee stud
was long and lean

734
00:46:33,012 --> 00:46:37,724
The colour of the sun
and his eyes were green

735
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:40,603
He had the nerve
and he had the blood

736
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:43,440
There never was a horse like the...

737
00:47:21,989 --> 00:47:24,659
How ya doin', Miss Jackie?

738
00:47:24,827 --> 00:47:26,702
Come on in.

739
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,844
- Do you got some booze?
- I got some vodka in the freezer.

740
00:47:39,012 --> 00:47:41,516
- Got some O.J.?
- Mm-hmm.

741
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:43,934
Why don't you be
a good hostess...

742
00:47:44,101 --> 00:47:46,936
and hook a brother up
a screwdriver?

743
00:47:47,105 --> 00:47:48,940
Sure.

744
00:47:55,282 --> 00:47:57,701
Well?

745
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:01,454
- You gonna thank me?
- For what?

746
00:48:01,623 --> 00:48:04,460
Who the hell do you think
got your ass out of jail?

747
00:48:04,626 --> 00:48:08,548
The same guy that put my ass in jail.
Thanks a lot.

748
00:48:08,715 --> 00:48:13,304
Hey, you got caught with blow.
That's your business.

749
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:16,268
- It wasn't mine.
- What?

750
00:48:16,434 --> 00:48:20,063
Oh, shit.

751
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,318
I bet that was that present
Mr Walker was sending Melanie.

752
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:27,489
Yeah. If you didn't
put it in there, he must have.

753
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:30,786
Damn. That shit wasn't called for.
Baby, I'm sorry.

754
00:48:30,952 --> 00:48:35,418
Bet they asked you a whole shitload
of questions about it, huh?

755
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:39,461
And all that money,
where it came from.

756
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:43,135
Probably asked you who you
was bringin' it to too.

757
00:48:44,802 --> 00:48:46,639
They asked.

758
00:48:47,974 --> 00:48:49,893
And you said?

759
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:54,231
"I want to talk to my lawyer".

760
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,445
You sure you didn't get nervous
and kind of let somethin' slip?

761
00:48:58,612 --> 00:49:01,115
I mean, if you did,
I ain't mad at you.

762
00:49:01,284 --> 00:49:03,119
I just gotta know.

763
00:49:04,871 --> 00:49:07,791
You ain't asking
the right questions.

764
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,637
You should be asking
why they picked me up.

765
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:23,018
They were waiting for me.

766
00:49:23,186 --> 00:49:26,690
They knew about the money
and they knew the exact amount.

767
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:31,695
They tell you how they happen
to come by this information?

768
00:49:31,864 --> 00:49:34,367
Hmm.

769
00:49:34,534 --> 00:49:36,702
Beaumont Livingston?

770
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:40,416
I knew it.
I knew it.

771
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:43,335
They even asked me
if I knew Mr Walker.

772
00:49:43,503 --> 00:49:45,338
Yeah?

773
00:49:46,757 --> 00:49:49,510
I didn't tell them
anything about him.

774
00:49:49,677 --> 00:49:51,889
My name come up?

775
00:49:52,054 --> 00:49:54,349
Mm-mm.

776
00:49:54,516 --> 00:49:58,396
- You ain't said nothin' about me?
- Mm-mm.

777
00:49:58,565 --> 00:50:02,027
Ah, that's mighty noble of you.

778
00:50:02,193 --> 00:50:06,782
They tell you what happened
to this Beaumont fellow?

779
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:09,202
Yeah, they told me.

780
00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:11,204
Yeah.

781
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:14,626
Somebody must have been
real mad at old Beaumont.

782
00:50:14,793 --> 00:50:19,590
Or else they pretty scared about what
he might say to keep from doing time.

783
00:50:21,469 --> 00:50:25,639
Yeah, I bet they asked you
a whole shitload of questions.

784
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:29,646
And you ain't givin' them
no kind of answer?

785
00:50:29,813 --> 00:50:33,858
- Mm-mm.
- You scared of me?

786
00:50:35,527 --> 00:50:39,447
You got any reason
to be nervous around me?

787
00:50:43,204 --> 00:50:45,164
Is that what
I think it is?

788
00:50:45,331 --> 00:50:47,791
What do you think it is?

789
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,297
- I think it's a gun pressed up against my dick.
- Well, you thought right.

790
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,302
Now, take your hands
from around my throat...

791
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,221
nigger.

792
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:00,474
- What the hell's wrong with you, Jackie?
- Shut the fuck up.

793
00:51:00,643 --> 00:51:03,646
Don't you move. Oh, what is this?
What the fuck is this?

794
00:51:03,813 --> 00:51:07,067
Hey, that ain't got nothing to do
with you. I carry that all the time.

795
00:51:07,235 --> 00:51:09,153
You been talking
to them police too much.

796
00:51:09,322 --> 00:51:11,824
- The police didn't try and strangle my ass.
- Come on, girl.

797
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:14,326
- I was just playing with you.
- I ain't playing with you.

798
00:51:14,494 --> 00:51:17,831
I'm gonna unload both of these motherfuckers
if you don't do what I tell you to do.

799
00:51:17,998 --> 00:51:20,168
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Jackie, stop acting crazy.

800
00:51:20,335 --> 00:51:23,213
- Do you understand what the fuck I'm saying?
- Yeah, woman. Damn!

801
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,675
Now, sit your ass down
on that sofa.

802
00:51:25,844 --> 00:51:30,347
See? Police start fuckin' with your mind,
start pittin' black against black.

803
00:51:30,514 --> 00:51:34,684
- That's how they do. They been doing this since...
- Shut your raggedy ass up.

804
00:51:34,853 --> 00:51:37,313
Sit the fuck down!

805
00:51:37,481 --> 00:51:40,652
And put your hands behind your head.

806
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:45,199
- This is gettin' silly now.
- Oh, silly? You want to see some motherfuckin' silly?

807
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:48,534
If I have to tell you to shut up one
more time, I'm gonna shut you up.

808
00:51:48,704 --> 00:51:52,708
- I just came over here to talk to you.
- To talk?

809
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:57,132
The way I see it, you and me got
one motherfucking thing to talk about.

810
00:51:57,298 --> 00:51:59,467
One thing...

811
00:51:59,635 --> 00:52:02,637
and that's what you
are willing to do for me.

812
00:52:02,806 --> 00:52:06,393
- I can get you a lawyer.
- No, let's be realistic.

813
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,603
Now, sooner or later they're gonna get
around to offering me a plea deal...

814
00:52:09,773 --> 00:52:11,648
and you know that.

815
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:14,403
- That's why you came here to kill me.
- I ain't come over to kill you.

816
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,780
No, that's all right.
It's okay.

817
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:19,286
Now, I forgive you.

818
00:52:19,452 --> 00:52:22,414
Now, Iet's say,
if I tell on you...

819
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:24,416
I walk.

820
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:27,128
- If I don't, I'll go to jail.
- Uh-huh.

821
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:29,965
I want $100,000...

822
00:52:30,132 --> 00:52:32,300
in an escrow account
in my name...

823
00:52:32,467 --> 00:52:36,014
if I'm convicted
up to a year or put on probation.

824
00:52:36,181 --> 00:52:38,974
Now, if I have to do
more than a year...

825
00:52:39,141 --> 00:52:42,478
you pay another $100,000.

826
00:52:47,447 --> 00:52:49,364
I can do that.

827
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:52,867
- You know I got that problem. All my money is...
- In Mexico.

828
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:56,706
- Right.
- Well, I been thinking about that too.

829
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,001
I got me an idea.

830
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:03,048
Uh...

831
00:53:03,175 --> 00:53:05,635
Let me hear that.
We friends again.

832
00:53:05,802 --> 00:53:09,014
Why don't you point that motherfucking
gun somewhere else?

833
00:53:14,688 --> 00:53:18,820
- I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
- All right.

834
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:39,052
You want your gun back?

835
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:42,056
Come on in.
I'll get it for you.

836
00:54:03,918 --> 00:54:06,588
Max, look,
I am so sorry about this.

837
00:54:06,755 --> 00:54:10,760
You know, I was afraid to ask to borrow it,
'cause I was afraid you would say no.

838
00:54:10,929 --> 00:54:13,179
I mean, you'd have to.

839
00:54:13,346 --> 00:54:16,266
Would you like some coffee?

840
00:54:16,434 --> 00:54:18,938
- If you're having some.
- I am. Come on in.

841
00:54:19,105 --> 00:54:21,521
Why don't you make
yourself at home.

842
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,152
Just, you know,
have a seat.

843
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:26,987
Did you get a chance
to use it?

844
00:54:27,114 --> 00:54:29,867
I felt a lot safer
having it.

845
00:54:30,036 --> 00:54:33,079
Oh, the milk went bad
while I was in jail.

846
00:54:33,248 --> 00:54:36,543
- Black's fine.
- Cool.

847
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,628
Would you, uh, care to hang
on to it for a while?

848
00:54:39,797 --> 00:54:43,177
It wouldn't be legal, but if it
makes you feel better, I guess...

849
00:54:43,344 --> 00:54:45,679
Well, thanks.
I got one now.

850
00:54:45,846 --> 00:54:48,516
- You went out this morning and bought a gun?

851
00:54:48,684 --> 00:54:52,271
- What? I didn't hear you.
- You went out this morning and bought a gun?

852
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,943
Well, let's say
I got one now, okay?

853
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:59,947
- Somebody loan it to you?
- Yeah.

854
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:06,956
All right!
We're on.

855
00:55:07,123 --> 00:55:10,836
It might be a little black.
Would you like to hear some music?

856
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:12,880
Sure.

857
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:14,884
Cool.

858
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,887
You know, I couldn't wait
to get home last night...

859
00:55:18,054 --> 00:55:20,516
and wash the jail
outta my hair.

860
00:55:20,681 --> 00:55:23,603
- It looks nice.
- Thanks.

861
00:55:25,146 --> 00:55:27,983
You never got into
the whole CD revolution?

862
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:31,487
Oh, I got a few, but I can't
afford to start all over again.

863
00:55:31,653 --> 00:55:34,490
I mean, I've invested
too much time and money...

864
00:55:34,657 --> 00:55:36,534
in my albums.

865
00:55:36,702 --> 00:55:38,956
Yeah, but you can't get
new stuff on records.

866
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:43,045
I don't get new stuff
that often.

867
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:02,860
I gave my heart and soul

868
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:06,239
To you, girl

869
00:56:06,407 --> 00:56:09,994
Didn't I do it, baby

870
00:56:10,163 --> 00:56:12,498
It's pretty.
Didn't I do it, baby

871
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:14,501
Mm-hmm.

872
00:56:14,668 --> 00:56:19,007
- Who is this?
- The Delfonics.

873
00:56:19,173 --> 00:56:22,260
- It's nice.
Didn't I do it, baby

874
00:56:22,427 --> 00:56:25,681
- Mm-hmm.
Didn't I do it, baby

875
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:29,519
I called in sick today. As far as the
airline knows, I'm still available.

876
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:31,563
- Are you?
- I don't know. I'm gonna go in

877
00:56:31,648 --> 00:56:33,443
and talk with Nicolet and Dargas today.

878
00:56:33,525 --> 00:56:37,237
I'm going to do what you suggested...
offer to help and see what happens.

879
00:56:37,405 --> 00:56:41,242
What I meant was to have a lawyer
do the negotiating for you.

880
00:56:41,409 --> 00:56:44,539
No, I want to talk to them first.
I know more now about Ordell's money.

881
00:56:44,706 --> 00:56:48,710
Well, if it's the A.T.F. guy that wants you,
that'll only interest him up to a point.

882
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,382
I know, but it's
a lot of money.

883
00:56:51,548 --> 00:56:55,387
It's a half a million dollars
all in Cabo, and more coming in.

884
00:56:55,554 --> 00:56:59,559
- How'd you find that out?
- Ordell told me last night.

885
00:56:59,724 --> 00:57:03,144
- He called?
- He came by.

886
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:06,900
- What'd you do?
- We talked.

887
00:57:07,068 --> 00:57:09,237
Do you think
he still trusts you?

888
00:57:09,405 --> 00:57:12,742
He had his doubts at first,
but he's always trusted me.

889
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:16,706
And he wants to believe more than
anything else that he still can.

890
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:21,501
- Why?
- Because he needs my ass.

891
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:25,798
Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit over
there in Cabo. You want some sugar?

892
00:57:25,967 --> 00:57:29,889
No, thank you. There's gotta be
other ways of getting it out.

893
00:57:30,056 --> 00:57:33,057
Maybe, but I'm the only one
he's ever used.

894
00:57:33,226 --> 00:57:36,063
I mean, he can't use
his other people. They're crooks.

895
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:38,983
I mean, he might try to...
bring the money in himself...

896
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:41,568
but he ain't gonna wanna
stand in no customs lines.

897
00:57:41,737 --> 00:57:45,367
So, either he recruits another Cabo
stewardess or he continues to trust me.

898
00:57:45,534 --> 00:57:48,079
And I made him feel
like he still can.

899
00:57:48,246 --> 00:57:51,039
Are you gonna offer
to set him up?

900
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:54,586
Yeah, if I get off.
Otherwise, fuck 'em.

901
00:57:54,755 --> 00:57:58,550
It's very possible
that Ordell's killed somebody.

902
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:01,094
Do you realize that?

903
00:58:01,262 --> 00:58:05,391
Well, I ain't going back to jail, and
I ain't doing that probation thing again.

904
00:58:11,818 --> 00:58:15,237
Max, how do you feel
about getting old?

905
00:58:15,405 --> 00:58:18,617
You're not old.
You look great.

906
00:58:18,784 --> 00:58:22,289
No, I'm asking you
how do you feel about getting old.

907
00:58:22,456 --> 00:58:26,710
- Doesn't it bother you?
- It's not really something I think about.

908
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:31,050
- Really?
- I guess I got sensitive about my hair a few years ago.

909
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:34,429
It started falling out,
so I did something about it.

910
00:58:34,597 --> 00:58:36,474
How'd you feel about that?

911
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:39,478
I feel fine with it.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it.

912
00:58:39,643 --> 00:58:43,356
I did it to feel better about myself,
and, you know, I do.

913
00:58:43,525 --> 00:58:46,987
I look in the mirror.
Looks like me.

914
00:58:47,153 --> 00:58:49,949
Yeah, but it's
different for men.

915
00:58:50,117 --> 00:58:53,871
You know, I can't really feel
too sorry for you in this department.

916
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:56,498
I bet that, except for
possibly an afro...

917
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,668
you look exactly
the way you did at 29.

918
00:59:01,378 --> 00:59:04,007
Well, my ass ain't the same.

919
00:59:04,134 --> 00:59:06,471
Bigger?

920
00:59:06,635 --> 00:59:08,597
Yeah.

921
00:59:08,764 --> 00:59:10,934
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

922
00:59:12,811 --> 00:59:16,148
Something else worry you?

923
00:59:16,315 --> 00:59:19,193
Oh.

924
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,492
I always feel like I'm starting over.

925
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:27,079
- How many bonds you said you wrote?
- 15,000.

926
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:31,126
- Is that a lot?
- That's plenty.

927
00:59:33,713 --> 00:59:36,382
Well, I've flown
over seven million miles...

928
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:39,719
and I've been waiting
on people for 20 years.

929
00:59:39,887 --> 00:59:43,349
Then after my bust, the best job
I could get was with Cabo Air...

930
00:59:43,516 --> 00:59:47,063
which is the worst job
you can get in this industry.

931
00:59:47,231 --> 00:59:49,565
You know I make
16,000 a year...

932
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:53,070
plus retirement benefits
that ain't worth a damn.

933
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:56,742
And with this arrest
hanging over my head, Max, I'm scared.

934
00:59:56,909 --> 00:59:59,579
And if I lose this job,
I gotta start all over again...

935
00:59:59,746 --> 01:00:01,916
and I ain't got nothing
to start over with.

936
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:05,128
I'll be stuck
with whatever I can get.

937
01:00:07,755 --> 01:00:10,719
And that shit
is more scary than Ordell.

938
01:00:19,855 --> 01:00:21,940
- Let's go.
- You don't have to... Ow!

939
01:00:22,108 --> 01:00:24,068
- Hey! Hey, great, you're here.

940
01:00:24,235 --> 01:00:26,570
- Yeah. Hey, Jackie. How're you doing?
- Fine.

941
01:00:26,737 --> 01:00:29,449
- Can I have a word outside with Ray for a minute?
- Sure. Take your time.

942
01:00:29,617 --> 01:00:31,619
- I'll just be a minute.
- May I smoke?

943
01:00:31,786 --> 01:00:34,625
Absolutely.

944
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:37,043
- Dude, what up?
- She wants to make a deal.

945
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,965
- Oh, yeah? Did she sound scared?
- She almost sounds scared.

946
01:00:40,132 --> 01:00:42,215
- What's she want?
- She wants to go back to work.

947
01:00:42,384 --> 01:00:44,887
- Oh, yeah? So what's she going to give us?
- She hasn't gone into specifics.

948
01:00:45,054 --> 01:00:47,556
- She's been waiting for you to get here.
- She knows it's my case, right?

949
01:00:47,724 --> 01:00:49,726
Well, she hasn't said it,
but she's not stupid.

950
01:00:49,893 --> 01:00:53,106
- She knows it's you who wants her.
- Let's go. Cool.

951
01:00:55,483 --> 01:00:57,900
Jackie, sorry to keep you waiting.

952
01:00:58,068 --> 01:01:00,739
Now, what can we do for you?

953
01:01:00,867 --> 01:01:04,496
I need permission to leave the country
so I can keep my job.

954
01:01:04,663 --> 01:01:08,210
- Yeah, we can look into that.
- I need it tomorrow.

955
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:11,378
If I don't show up for work tomorrow,
I'm fired.

956
01:01:11,547 --> 01:01:13,965
Well, you know what we want.

957
01:01:14,132 --> 01:01:16,342
If I'm working,I can help you.

958
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:18,887
Help us do what, Jackie?

959
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:22,391
- Help you get Ordell Robbie.
- So now, you do know him.

960
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,394
You never asked if I did or not.

961
01:01:24,563 --> 01:01:27,065
- So you're telling us now that you do know him.
- Of course I do.

962
01:01:27,233 --> 01:01:29,902
- I deliver money for him.
- No shit?

963
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:33,907
- You know how he makes his money?
- He sells guns.

964
01:01:34,074 --> 01:01:36,409
- You ever see him sell a gun?
- No.

965
01:01:36,577 --> 01:01:38,831
- Then how do you know he sells guns?
- He told me.

966
01:01:38,998 --> 01:01:42,085
Besides, why else would
an A.T.F. man be after him?

967
01:01:47,092 --> 01:01:49,677
Well, how can you help us?

968
01:01:49,844 --> 01:01:54,432
I'll do anything I can to help you
get his ass, short of wearing a wire.

969
01:01:54,601 --> 01:01:57,688
And in return for my help, I need permission
to leave the country, and immunity.

970
01:01:57,855 --> 01:02:00,775
You don't want much, do you?

971
01:02:00,942 --> 01:02:03,110
Can you do it or not?

972
01:02:06,617 --> 01:02:08,869
You know, I mean...

973
01:02:09,036 --> 01:02:11,873
It's possible.

974
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:13,791
You're going to hear a guy
beg for his life, lady...

975
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,293
'cause he betrayed Nani Vitali.

976
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:18,213
Read the paper.

977
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,219
Read it!

978
01:02:22,929 --> 01:02:25,347
Nani Vitali, a dangerous criminal.

979
01:02:25,514 --> 01:02:27,476
He's already killed two people.

980
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:31,231
You know what he's known as?
The Mad Dog Murderer.

981
01:02:33,608 --> 01:02:35,862
- Hey, girl.
- Hola!

982
01:02:38,492 --> 01:02:42,286
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Looks like
somebody got some new clothes.

983
01:02:42,452 --> 01:02:44,621
Yeah, we did
a little shopping.

984
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:47,626
You know, I couldn't have my boy
running around looking like no bum.

985
01:02:47,793 --> 01:02:50,297
- I don't know. I didn't look like a bum.
- Come on now, man.

986
01:02:50,463 --> 01:02:53,800
You know you had that Salvation Army
thing going.

987
01:02:53,969 --> 01:02:58,597
Goddamn, girl. You getting high already?
It's just 2:00.

988
01:02:58,766 --> 01:03:00,976
It's that late?

989
01:03:01,143 --> 01:03:03,311
You smoke too much of that shit, that
shit's gonna rob you of your ambition.

990
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,692
Not if your ambition
is to get high and watch TV.

991
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:12,324
Oh, y'all a couple of
Cheech and Chongs, huh?

992
01:03:12,492 --> 01:03:15,954
Oh, don't get up. I got it.

993
01:03:16,121 --> 01:03:17,998
Have a seat.

994
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:21,795
Yo. Jackie! What's up?

995
01:03:21,963 --> 01:03:24,340
No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.

996
01:03:24,507 --> 01:03:27,677
- I was gonna tell you!
- No, no, no, no, no, not on the phone.

997
01:03:27,844 --> 01:03:29,764
Here.

998
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,849
- You gotta make sure ain't nobody following you.
- It's ready to go?

999
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,018
Yeah. There's another bowl left.

1000
01:03:43,322 --> 01:03:45,992
- Take your thumb off the carb.

1001
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:54,003
Shit.

1002
01:03:55,378 --> 01:03:57,507
You okay?

1003
01:03:57,673 --> 01:03:59,550
I'm just... getting old.

1004
01:04:02,014 --> 01:04:06,309
I can't... smoke or laugh now
without coughing.

1005
01:04:06,478 --> 01:04:09,061
Coughing's good. It opens
up the capillaries.

1006
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:12,858
You know, when you cough, you're
pulling air... in this case, smoke...

1007
01:04:13,027 --> 01:04:15,530
into parts of the lungs
that don't normally get used.

1008
01:04:15,699 --> 01:04:18,201
And so, coughing's good.
It gets you higher.

1009
01:04:18,367 --> 01:04:20,454
You definitely know
a lot about that.

1010
01:04:20,621 --> 01:04:23,039
Look here, Louis, I got
to run out for a little while.

1011
01:04:23,206 --> 01:04:25,543
So, since you like
getting high so much...

1012
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:28,045
why don't you hang out here with Mel,
watch a little TV?

1013
01:04:28,211 --> 01:04:30,715
- Way ahead of you.
- See, I get high later on when I come back.

1014
01:04:30,884 --> 01:04:34,054
See, I get high at night when I
get through with all my business.

1015
01:04:34,221 --> 01:04:37,974
Is that Rutger Hauer?

1016
01:04:40,105 --> 01:04:42,021
No, it's Helmut Berger.

1017
01:04:42,188 --> 01:04:44,065
Hmm.

1018
01:04:44,233 --> 01:04:47,487
- Why don't you walk me to the door, space girl?
- Okay.

1019
01:04:49,572 --> 01:04:51,994
- You know, I hope you don't mind
hanging out with Louis.

1020
01:04:52,077 --> 01:04:52,911
No problem.

1021
01:04:53,077 --> 01:04:55,916
Try not to tear his clothes
off of him, all right? They're new.

1022
01:04:56,081 --> 01:04:58,126
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Ha, ha!

1023
01:04:58,293 --> 01:05:01,630
- Yo, Louis! Catch you later, man.
- Okay. Later.

1024
01:05:06,844 --> 01:05:09,847
- Want a Metrix?

1025
01:05:10,016 --> 01:05:12,394
Uh... Damn. Shit.

1026
01:05:12,561 --> 01:05:14,606
What's a Metrix?

1027
01:05:14,773 --> 01:05:18,025
It's like this major meal that you drink in
a shake instead of having a big meal.

1028
01:05:18,193 --> 01:05:19,945
It's like a diet thing?

1029
01:05:20,028 --> 01:05:22,949
No. It's what bodybuilders drink
to, you know, beef up.

1030
01:05:23,702 --> 01:05:25,702
No, thanks.

1031
01:05:25,869 --> 01:05:28,331
Okay.

1032
01:05:31,126 --> 01:05:33,505
When was the last time I saw you?

1033
01:05:33,672 --> 01:05:36,007
Oh... six, seven years ago.

1034
01:05:36,173 --> 01:05:38,677
It doesn't seem
like that long ago.

1035
01:05:38,844 --> 01:05:42,516
It was that long ago.

1036
01:05:45,436 --> 01:05:48,898
- How old were you in this picture?
- Which one?

1037
01:05:49,067 --> 01:05:52,485
The roller disco picture. This one.

1038
01:05:52,653 --> 01:05:54,822
Oh. Um, 14.

1039
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:58,954
- You were 14 here?
- Yup.

1040
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,666
Shit, man. I thought
you were at least 16.

1041
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:06,338
Well, I'm about the same height now
as I was then.

1042
01:06:26,655 --> 01:06:29,032
- That other picture, that green one?
-  Yeah?

1043
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:31,536
That was taken at that place
called Flippers.

1044
01:06:31,702 --> 01:06:33,956
Do you remember that? It was
in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. then?

1045
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:36,085
- No.
- Where were you?

1046
01:06:36,251 --> 01:06:38,711
I was in Detroit.

1047
01:06:38,878 --> 01:06:40,715
With Ordell?

1048
01:06:40,882 --> 01:06:43,260
Yeah. We had done
some time already.

1049
01:06:43,427 --> 01:06:46,556
Oh. Were you a... disco guy?

1050
01:06:46,722 --> 01:06:49,307
Nah.

1051
01:06:49,476 --> 01:06:53,565
- Come on. Don't lie.
- No, I wasn't. I don't like to dance.

1052
01:06:53,733 --> 01:06:57,695
- Were you ever in one?
- I went to a few just to meet women, but...

1053
01:06:57,862 --> 01:07:01,657
it was so loud and I didn't
like to dance.

1054
01:07:01,824 --> 01:07:05,829
During that whole scene,
I just drank in bars usually.

1055
01:07:05,998 --> 01:07:09,168
So who didn't make the cut?

1056
01:07:09,335 --> 01:07:12,755
- That's a picture of me in Japan.
- Whose arm is that?

1057
01:07:12,923 --> 01:07:15,675
Uh, that's the guy
that I lived with.

1058
01:07:15,844 --> 01:07:18,179
His name was Hi-Hiro...
Hiro... Hiroshi.

1059
01:07:18,347 --> 01:07:21,016
- He must have made
quite an impression.

1060
01:07:21,182 --> 01:07:24,688
If you count cheese.
I never got to know him really.

1061
01:07:24,855 --> 01:07:27,690
You know, I couldn't speak any Japanese,
and his English was terrible.

1062
01:07:27,858 --> 01:07:32,197
But what am I going to say? His English
was better than my Japanese, you know.

1063
01:07:32,364 --> 01:07:35,534
- That sounds like a problem.
- Not really.

1064
01:07:35,702 --> 01:07:38,119
You know, we didn't have that much
to say to each other anyway.

1065
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:40,625
I never really got to know him,
but I knew enough to know...

1066
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:43,460
that I wasn't
missing much, so...

1067
01:07:43,628 --> 01:07:45,922
Anyway, I keep that picture because,
of all the fucking time I was there...

1068
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:48,550
that's the only picture
I've got of me in Japan.

1069
01:07:48,717 --> 01:07:50,762
- That's Japan.
- Oh. Yeah.

1070
01:07:50,931 --> 01:07:53,306
Well... Yeah, I can...
Yeah, it looks. I could tell.

1071
01:07:53,474 --> 01:07:56,144
Wanna fuck?

1072
01:07:56,269 --> 01:07:58,271
Yeah.

1073
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:15,460
That was fun.

1074
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:18,465
Yeah. Yeah, that really
hit the spot.

1075
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,643
Now we can catch up.

1076
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,481
Yeah.

1077
01:08:35,485 --> 01:08:38,739
You got a beer?

1078
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:41,243
Yeah, sure. In the fridge.

1079
01:08:45,582 --> 01:08:49,086
Uh, I mean, damn
Me and you forever hand in hand

1080
01:08:49,252 --> 01:08:51,798

01:08:57,432 --> 01:08:59,516

1087
01:09:30,015 --> 01:09:32,768
I'm going to the bar, baby.

1088
01:09:35,146 --> 01:09:37,564
- Jackie Jack!
- Hey.

1089
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:42,320
Damn! I'm gonna have to remember
this place. This is all right.

1090
01:09:42,488 --> 01:09:45,158
About two minutes from your crib,
ten minutes from the gig. Not bad.

1091
01:09:45,326 --> 01:09:48,162
- What's your drink, brother?
- Let me get a screwdriver, home.

1092
01:09:48,328 --> 01:09:50,497
- How're you doing?
- Oh, I'm fine.

1093
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:54,170
Yes, you are.

1094
01:09:54,337 --> 01:09:57,006
Damn! I bet you come in here
on a Saturday night...

1095
01:09:57,173 --> 01:10:00,970
you need nigger repellant to
keep them motherfuckers off your ass.

1096
01:10:01,137 --> 01:10:04,056
- Oh, I do okay.
- Bullshit, Jackie.

1097
01:10:04,224 --> 01:10:08,480
You're a fine motherfucker. I bet
you do a damn sight better than okay.

1098
01:10:08,648 --> 01:10:11,734
- You think anybody followed you?
- I don't think so.

1099
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,819
But it don't matter, 'cause they
already know I'm meeting you.

1100
01:10:14,988 --> 01:10:17,158
- How the fuck they know that?
- I told them.

1101
01:10:17,324 --> 01:10:19,243
- You told...
- 3.25.

1102
01:10:19,408 --> 01:10:21,829
- Here. Keep it.
- Thank you, sir.

1103
01:10:21,997 --> 01:10:23,832
- You told 'em it's me?
- They already know it's you.

1104
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,002
Goddamn, that don't mean
you got to confirm it.

1105
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:28,337
Look, the only way they're going
to give me permission to fly...

1106
01:10:28,505 --> 01:10:32,092
is if I agree to help 'em, which is
what I have to appear to be doing.

1107
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:35,514
So I might as well give them
somebody they already know... you.

1108
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,475
You tell 'em anything else?

1109
01:10:37,641 --> 01:10:41,145
Yeah, you got a half a mil in Mexico,
and you want me to bring it in.

1110
01:10:41,314 --> 01:10:44,358
- Goddamn... You told them all that?
- It's true, ain't it?

1111
01:10:44,524 --> 01:10:47,362
What the fuck that got
to do with anything?

1112
01:10:47,529 --> 01:10:49,405
They know I'm delivering for you.

1113
01:10:49,573 --> 01:10:52,161
I told 'em about the half mil.
They could give a fuck about it.

1114
01:10:52,326 --> 01:10:54,787
All they wanna do
is catch your ass with guns.

1115
01:10:54,956 --> 01:10:57,667
So I said, "Look, you want proof
he's getting paid for selling 'em?

1116
01:10:57,833 --> 01:11:00,002
- Let me bring in the money".
- And they said?

1117
01:11:00,171 --> 01:11:02,965
Yes.

1118
01:11:03,131 --> 01:11:06,761
Hey, what's the matter? I mean,
that's what we discussed last night.

1119
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:10,684
This is just seeming kind of
risky now, you know. Fuck this.

1120
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,520
Now, let me lay it all out
to you, okay?

1121
01:11:13,645 --> 01:11:16,442
I make two deliveries...
the first with 10,000.

1122
01:11:16,609 --> 01:11:19,945
You know, like a dry run?
They watch it, see how it works.

1123
01:11:20,112 --> 01:11:22,448
Then the second delivery,
I come home with the half mil.

1124
01:11:22,614 --> 01:11:24,952
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
See, that's too much exposure.

1125
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:27,956
- Now, I ain't goin' nowhere near that money.
- You don't have to.

1126
01:11:28,123 --> 01:11:30,335
I told them you never pick up
the money yourself.

1127
01:11:30,502 --> 01:11:33,671
You always send someone,
and I never know who it is.

1128
01:11:33,838 --> 01:11:37,132
- That's a good idea.
- If you listen, it's a damn good idea.

1129
01:11:37,301 --> 01:11:40,137
Now, the first time I do it,
they're looking around...

1130
01:11:40,305 --> 01:11:42,641
they see me hand
the 10,000 to someone.

1131
01:11:42,806 --> 01:11:46,063
- Who?
- I don't know. A friend of yours.

1132
01:11:46,228 --> 01:11:49,233
- Like a woman?
- If you want.

1133
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,985
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm thinking a woman.

1134
01:11:52,154 --> 01:11:55,364
Wait a minute. If they're gonna let you go...
how come we don't bring all the

1135
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:57,994
cash in the first time?
- 'Cause I don't trust 'em.

1136
01:11:58,162 --> 01:12:00,831
Now, the next trip,
when I bring in the half mils...

1137
01:12:00,957 --> 01:12:03,708
it's gonna look like I'm doing
the same thing as I did before.

1138
01:12:03,876 --> 01:12:07,337
- But you don't?
- No. I hand it to someone else first.

1139
01:12:07,506 --> 01:12:09,842
Hmm. And they
follow the wrong one...

1140
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:12,011
thinking she's bringing
the money to me.

1141
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:15,600
- That's the idea.
- So, we gonna need two women.

1142
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:18,145
- Can you cover that?
- Yeah.

1143
01:12:18,311 --> 01:12:20,480
Yeah, I got
the women covered.

1144
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:23,025
Where are you planning
on pulling this off?

1145
01:12:23,193 --> 01:12:25,613
The Del Amo Mall,
the food court.

1146
01:12:25,779 --> 01:12:27,988
And I suppose you see
a piece of this for yourself?

1147
01:12:28,783 --> 01:12:31,118
It's my plan.
We're in this together.

1148
01:12:31,287 --> 01:12:34,039
Yeah, but it's my money,
and I don't need no fuckin' partners.

1149
01:12:34,207 --> 01:12:36,543
I ain't your partner.
I'm your manager.

1150
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:39,966
And I'm managing to get your money out of
Mexico, into America, in your hands...

1151
01:12:40,131 --> 01:12:42,467
and I'm managing to do it
all under the nose of the cops.

1152
01:12:42,635 --> 01:12:45,427
So, therefore, I'm your manager,
and a manager gets 15%.

1153
01:12:45,595 --> 01:12:48,641
- No, a manager gets ten percent.
- No, that's an agent.

1154
01:12:48,807 --> 01:12:50,810
- I'm gonna give you ten.
- No. No.

1155
01:12:50,978 --> 01:12:53,564
A manager gets 15%,
agent gets 10.

1156
01:12:53,733 --> 01:12:55,568
I'm getting 15%, all right?

1157
01:12:55,734 --> 01:12:58,195
All I'm gonna give you is ten.

1158
01:12:58,363 --> 01:13:00,698
And the same deal as before.

1159
01:13:05,203 --> 01:13:08,207
I can do that.

1160
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:11,128
So he says, "Fuck that",
and moves over into guns.

1161
01:13:11,296 --> 01:13:14,134
See, you can sell guns wherever there's
a demand, and nobody gives a shit.

1162
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,844
He's acting like he's this big
international arms dealer...

1163
01:13:17,011 --> 01:13:20,890
when, come on, face it, the only people
he ever sold to were dopers.

1164
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,814
Well, he seems
to be making out.

1165
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,652
- Is it dead?
- Yeah.

1166
01:13:28,817 --> 01:13:31,320
Yeah, well...
so far, he is.

1167
01:13:31,488 --> 01:13:34,326
But you got to admit,
he's not too bright.

1168
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:37,412
Oh... I wouldn't go
so far as to say that.

1169
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,916
He moves his lips
when he reads.

1170
01:13:41,082 --> 01:13:43,085
What does that tell you?

1171
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:46,256
Let's say that
he's streetwise, you know.

1172
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:50,052
We'll give him that.
He's still a fuckup.

1173
01:14:01,902 --> 01:14:05,573
He killed a man who worked for him
the other day.

1174
01:14:05,739 --> 01:14:07,909
Well...

1175
01:14:09,954 --> 01:14:12,456
So, what are you trying
to tell me?

1176
01:14:12,623 --> 01:14:14,792
That I should get out of here?

1177
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,296
That's not what
I'm saying at all.

1178
01:14:17,462 --> 01:14:21,301
You know where he went?
He went to go meet that stewardess.

1179
01:14:22,802 --> 01:14:25,224
- Does that bother you?
- Please!

1180
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:30,060
Well, I don't know.
You live with him, so...

1181
01:14:30,229 --> 01:14:33,734
No, I live here.
He just drops in and out.

1182
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:37,404
Did he tell you about that half million
he's got down in Mexico?

1183
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:40,283
Of course he did. He tells
anybody who's gonna listen.

1184
01:14:40,451 --> 01:14:42,744
Well, that's what him
and that stewardess are doing.

1185
01:14:42,913 --> 01:14:46,250
They're scheming on how they can
get that money over here.

1186
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:48,918
And your point is?

1187
01:14:49,086 --> 01:14:53,801
Let him and the stewardess get
the money over here...

1188
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:57,139
and then just
take it from them.

1189
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:08,487
- Can I ask you a question?
- Oh, man.

1190
01:15:08,654 --> 01:15:11,489
You ain't gonna get serious
while we're in here chilling?

1191
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:12,993
No. It's just about Melanie.

1192
01:15:13,158 --> 01:15:15,829
You know what?
I'm real sorry about that, man...

1193
01:15:15,956 --> 01:15:18,291
but I had to be somewhere
all of a sudden.

1194
01:15:18,457 --> 01:15:21,002
I figured, well, shit,
Louis ain't had no pussy for a while.

1195
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:24,171
So I thought, let him
kick it here with Mel.

1196
01:15:29,262 --> 01:15:31,431
So, what she say?

1197
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,478
She didn't have to say shit.
I know Melanie.

1198
01:15:34,645 --> 01:15:37,730
That bitch is gonna be fucking you
two minutes after I'm out the door.

1199
01:15:37,898 --> 01:15:40,569
Melanie real good about
throwing a fuck a nigger's way.

1200
01:15:40,735 --> 01:15:44,405
I mean, she ain't no damn good at it,
but she likes to fuck.

1201
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:47,412
- Oh, so she ain't your girlfriend?
- Is that what you thought?

1202
01:15:47,578 --> 01:15:50,414
- No, I wasn't sure. I didn't know.
- But you fucked her anyway?

1203
01:15:50,582 --> 01:15:52,417
Well...

1204
01:15:52,586 --> 01:15:55,921
the "not your girlfriend" part
I felt more about.

1205
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:58,966
Oh. Well, I hope you felt
appropriately guilty afterwards.

1206
01:15:59,135 --> 01:16:01,179
Afterwards, I did.

1207
01:16:06,269 --> 01:16:08,439
Oh, oh, shit.

1208
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,947
But, um... But, like,
you know, what is she to you?

1209
01:16:15,113 --> 01:16:17,783
You know, she's just
one of the bitches I got set up.

1210
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:20,287
I got Mel
over in Hermosa Beach...

1211
01:16:20,453 --> 01:16:23,206
and I rent this little place for Simone
over in Compton where you're staying...

1212
01:16:23,373 --> 01:16:27,671
and about four blocks away I got this young
19-year-old country girl named Sheronda.

1213
01:16:27,837 --> 01:16:30,422
I found her on the bus stop
two days out of Georgia...

1214
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,761
barefoot, country
as a chicken coop.

1215
01:16:32,929 --> 01:16:35,765
Took her to my place in Compton,
told her it was Hollywood.

1216
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:38,725
- She believed you?
- Hell, yeah.

1217
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:41,564
To her dumb country ass,
Compton is Hollywood.

1218
01:16:41,729 --> 01:16:43,942
Closest she's
ever been, anyway.

1219
01:16:44,109 --> 01:16:46,904
But you trust Melanie
around your business?

1220
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:49,573
Oh!

1221
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:52,577
She trying to play your ass
against me, ain't she?

1222
01:16:52,743 --> 01:16:55,414
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. See, I knew it.

1223
01:16:55,582 --> 01:16:59,752
I knew it. I knew it! See, you didn't
have to say nothing. I know that bitch.

1224
01:16:59,921 --> 01:17:03,591
I don't understand why you keep someone around
your business and you can't even trust 'em.

1225
01:17:03,759 --> 01:17:06,302
I ain't gotta trust her.
I know her.

1226
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:09,515
I don't know
what that means, man.

1227
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:12,101
Well, you can't trust Melanie...

1228
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:15,606
but you can always trust
Melanie to be Melanie.

1229
01:17:15,774 --> 01:17:19,194
Well, I don't understand
why you keep her the fuck around.

1230
01:17:19,362 --> 01:17:22,405
I told you, man.
She's my fine little surfer girl.

1231
01:17:22,573 --> 01:17:25,078
You know, she ain't pretty
as she used to be...

1232
01:17:25,243 --> 01:17:27,997
and she bitch a whole lot more
than she used to...

1233
01:17:28,164 --> 01:17:30,167
but she white.

1234
01:18:00,372 --> 01:18:04,377
You have one message sent at 8:06 p.m.

1235
01:18:04,545 --> 01:18:06,921
Hi, Jackie. It's Max.

1236
01:18:07,088 --> 01:18:10,509
I was just calling to find out
how everything went today at A.T.F.

1237
01:18:10,677 --> 01:18:13,680
If you want to call me,
my home number is...

1238
01:18:13,845 --> 01:18:17,935
915-9302.

1239
01:18:18,103 --> 01:18:20,689
Or you can reach me
at my office, which is...

1240
01:18:20,855 --> 01:18:24,153
313-3688.

1241
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:26,655
That's on the card I gave you
when we first met.

1242
01:18:26,823 --> 01:18:29,658
I don't know whether
you still have it, but it's on it.

1243
01:18:29,827 --> 01:18:32,162
Oh, let me give you
my beeper number.

1244
01:18:32,329 --> 01:18:36,835
- It's 991-1075...

1245
01:18:37,002 --> 01:18:40,881
then dial 6872.

1246
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:44,345
Wait for a beep,
dial 59...

1247
01:18:44,512 --> 01:18:46,681
and hit the pound.

1248
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:49,350
Um, okay, so I'll talk
to you later.

1249
01:18:49,518 --> 01:18:51,854
Hope everything's well. Bye-bye.

1250
01:18:52,021 --> 01:18:53,855
End of message.

1251
01:19:06,466 --> 01:19:09,386
Now, the money's gonna be in a
Del Amo shopping bag, all right?

1252
01:19:09,554 --> 01:19:13,057
I get some food, sit down here in the
food court, then your girl comes in.

1253
01:19:13,226 --> 01:19:15,313
- Did you find somebody yet?
- Mm-hmm.

1254
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:17,315
- Who?
- What you care?

1255
01:19:17,483 --> 01:19:19,774
What I care is my ass
facing the penitentiary.

1256
01:19:19,942 --> 01:19:22,403
- You send some hardheaded rock whore up here and she...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1257
01:19:22,572 --> 01:19:26,452
She ain't gonna be no rock whore.
She's gonna be cool, I promise.

1258
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:46,601
- All right, so we're straight, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1259
01:19:46,769 --> 01:19:49,354
I'm gonna roll up over here and check
out this shirt I was looking at.

1260
01:19:49,523 --> 01:19:52,943
- I'll catch you.
- Hey, don't forget your bags.

1261
01:20:15,595 --> 01:20:17,765
Shit!

1262
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:38,793
Max! Max!

1263
01:20:40,546 --> 01:20:42,215
Hey.

1264
01:20:44,301 --> 01:20:46,386
Well, hello.

1265
01:20:46,552 --> 01:20:50,056
- Hey, surprise.
- I walked right past you.

1266
01:20:50,224 --> 01:20:52,895
I know, ignoring me.
So, what are you up to?

1267
01:20:53,061 --> 01:20:55,771
- Just catching a movie.
- What'd you see?

1268
01:20:57,234 --> 01:21:00,445
What the fuck is up
with this shit?

1269
01:21:10,752 --> 01:21:13,881
- I called you last night.
- I know. I got your message.

1270
01:21:14,047 --> 01:21:17,551
Ray wanted to have dinner with me so we can,
you know, talk about the sting we're plotting.

1271
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,264
That's what he calls it, a sting.

1272
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:22,975
He's been...
He's been real nice.

1273
01:21:24,351 --> 01:21:26,519
You think he's got
a thing for you?

1274
01:21:26,686 --> 01:21:28,940
Maybe.

1275
01:21:29,108 --> 01:21:34,113
But I'm thinking it's something more
like he wants the money for himself.

1276
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,868
Has he hinted around?

1277
01:21:37,033 --> 01:21:39,953
No. He just tries to act cool.

1278
01:21:40,122 --> 01:21:42,957
You know, I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

1279
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:45,920
He's just a young guy
having fun being a cop.

1280
01:21:46,087 --> 01:21:48,422
I know the type.
Trust me on this.

1281
01:21:48,591 --> 01:21:51,761
He's more interested in Ordell
than he is in the money.

1282
01:21:51,929 --> 01:21:55,097
If he does anything suspect, it'll be
cutting corners to get the conviction...

1283
01:21:55,265 --> 01:21:58,853
but he wouldn't walk off
with the money, it's evidence.

1284
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:01,940
- And what about you, Max?
- What?

1285
01:22:02,108 --> 01:22:04,109
If I was in Nicolet's place?

1286
01:22:04,278 --> 01:22:07,364
No, I mean you right now,
not if you were somebody else.

1287
01:22:07,532 --> 01:22:11,703
If I saw an opportunity to walk away with a
shopping bag full of money, would I take it?

1288
01:22:11,869 --> 01:22:15,791
You know where it came from. It's not
like it's somebody's life savings.

1289
01:22:15,957 --> 01:22:18,668
It wouldn't even be missed.

1290
01:22:18,837 --> 01:22:21,966
Half a million dollars
will always be missed.

1291
01:22:22,132 --> 01:22:24,804
You're avoiding
the question, Max.

1292
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:29,310
Okay, sure, I guess
I'd be tempted...

1293
01:22:29,476 --> 01:22:32,439
especially now since I'm getting
out of the bail bond business.

1294
01:22:32,604 --> 01:22:34,814
- Why?
- A lot of reasons.

1295
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:39,529
I guess the main one would be,
uh... I'm tired of it.

1296
01:22:43,996 --> 01:22:45,997
When did you decide?

1297
01:22:46,164 --> 01:22:48,332
It's been a long time coming...

1298
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,836
but I finally made up my mind.

1299
01:22:51,002 --> 01:22:53,965
I guess it was... Thursday.

1300
01:22:54,131 --> 01:22:56,134
- Miss Brown?

1301
01:22:56,301 --> 01:23:00,099
- Yes?
- I'm Max Cherry, your bail bondsman.

1302
01:23:00,265 --> 01:23:03,019
The night you got me out of jail?

1303
01:23:03,186 --> 01:23:06,020
Yeah. I went to pick up this guy.

1304
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:09,065
I hear he's staying
at a house, and, uh...

1305
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,362
I sneak in,
and I'm waiting for him...

1306
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:15,868
Wait a minute. After we were together,
you snuck into a guy's house?

1307
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:20,373
Yeah. I went back to my office
and found out that you took my gun...

1308
01:23:20,542 --> 01:23:23,001
got another gun
and the stun gun...

1309
01:23:23,167 --> 01:23:26,090
went to this guy's house in El Monte
and waited for him to come home.

1310
01:23:26,257 --> 01:23:29,345
- What do you do when he comes home?
- Shoot him with the stun gun.

1311
01:23:29,511 --> 01:23:32,849
While he's incapacitated, you cuff
him and take him to County.

1312
01:23:33,015 --> 01:23:34,851
- You do that?
- It's my job.

1313
01:23:35,019 --> 01:23:37,520
- Did you do that that night?
- Well, the guy never came home.

1314
01:23:37,688 --> 01:23:41,567
But I'm sitting on his couch
in the dark holding my stun gun.

1315
01:23:41,734 --> 01:23:44,947
The whole house
smells of cat pee.

1316
01:23:45,114 --> 01:23:48,283
And after a couple of hours,
I think...

1317
01:23:48,453 --> 01:23:50,622
"Why am I doing this?"

1318
01:23:50,787 --> 01:23:53,541
It's 19 years of this shit.

1319
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:57,631
And I make up my mind.
That's it.

1320
01:23:57,796 --> 01:24:01,300
I'm not sure you answered
my question, Max.

1321
01:24:01,467 --> 01:24:03,176
Which one?

1322
01:24:03,345 --> 01:24:06,975
If you had the chance,
unemployed now...

1323
01:24:07,141 --> 01:24:10,939
to walk away with a
half million dollars...

1324
01:24:11,105 --> 01:24:13,439
would you take it?

1325
01:24:33,341 --> 01:24:36,051
We gotta stop meeting like this.

1326
01:24:37,681 --> 01:24:40,268
- How was your flight?
- Fine.

1327
01:24:40,435 --> 01:24:43,436
- Bet you're happy to be working again.
- Yeah.

1328
01:24:43,605 --> 01:24:46,025
This is A.T.F. Agent Ray Nicolet.

1329
01:24:46,193 --> 01:24:48,359
Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie.

1330
01:24:48,527 --> 01:24:50,905
Money exchange, trial run.

1331
01:24:51,073 --> 01:24:54,033
Time is 3:07...

1332
01:24:54,202 --> 01:24:57,203
July 1, 1995.

1333
01:24:57,372 --> 01:24:59,792
Location is
a parking structure at LAX...

1334
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,127
row "F",
parking structure "D".

1335
01:25:02,296 --> 01:25:04,465
- What are you doing?
- Recording all this.

1336
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:07,092
- I thought you were going to let this one go through.
- We are. Don't worry about it.

1337
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,595
Every bit of this
goes in my report.

1338
01:25:09,762 --> 01:25:12,100
The subject is carrying
a flight bag.

1339
01:25:12,268 --> 01:25:16,564
I am now removing from the flight bag
a manila envelope.

1340
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:20,277
The envelope contains currency.

1341
01:25:22,863 --> 01:25:25,032
- All the same denomination?
- Mm-hmm.

1342
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,118
One-hundred-dollar bills.

1343
01:25:27,286 --> 01:25:29,622
Okay, I'm now counting it.

1344
01:25:29,789 --> 01:25:33,043
- What time do you have to be there?
- 4:30. I'm meeting a woman.

1345
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,297
- What's her name?
- He wouldn't say.

1346
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:40,926
- You gonna follow her?
- When she leaves, somebody'll be on her.

1347
01:25:41,095 --> 01:25:43,599
- You're not gonna stop her?
- No, not this time.

1348
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:47,435
Okay. The total amount
of cash...

1349
01:25:47,811 --> 01:25:50,940
in the manila envelope
is $10000, right?

1350
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:56,072
- The subject will be delivering the currency in a..
- Oh.

1351
01:25:56,238 --> 01:25:58,992
Del Amo Fashion Centre bag.

1352
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:01,828
Del Amo Fashion Centre bag.

1353
01:26:01,954 --> 01:26:05,542
- The bag is, uh... purple..
- It's white.

1354
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:07,628
- Huh? - White.
- It's white.

1355
01:26:07,796 --> 01:26:09,631
- Fine, the bag's white..
- With pink lettering.

1356
01:26:09,798 --> 01:26:11,632
- Purp..
- Images of purple.

1357
01:26:11,801 --> 01:26:13,677
- Lettering's pink.
- Fine..

1358
01:26:13,845 --> 01:26:16,515
Okay, the bag's white. It's got purple
on it, and the lettering's pink.

1359
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,185
- Right.
- With a really good-looking woman on the cover.

1360
01:26:19,351 --> 01:26:21,188
Okay. There you go.

1361
01:27:11,711 --> 01:27:15,965
- This seat taken?
- No. Have a seat.

1362
01:27:22,434 --> 01:27:24,935
- You're hungry.
- Yes'm.

1363
01:27:26,938 --> 01:27:30,274
Put the bag on the floor, okay?
Under the table, next to mine.

1364
01:27:37,368 --> 01:27:40,662
And then when I leave...
Well, you know.

1365
01:27:42,122 --> 01:27:44,000
So, what's your name?

1366
01:27:45,586 --> 01:27:47,421
Sheronda.

1367
01:27:47,588 --> 01:27:50,010
Sheronda, that's a nice name.

1368
01:27:52,762 --> 01:27:55,475
Sheronda, go ahead.
You can eat.

1369
01:28:04,903 --> 01:28:08,157
Well, Sheronda,
it was nice talking to you.

1370
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,725
All right. I'll be back.
I'll check the bag. Stay here.

1371
01:28:34,024 --> 01:28:37,444
Max, you said it yourself.
Ray wants Ordell.

1372
01:28:37,609 --> 01:28:40,280
He doesn't give a shit
about the money.

1373
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:42,618
The money won't convict him.
Guns will.

1374
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:45,050
You're rationalizing.

1375
01:28:45,216 --> 01:28:48,220
Well, that's what you do to go through
with the shit you start.

1376
01:28:48,387 --> 01:28:50,221
You rationalize.

1377
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:53,810
I can do it, Max.
I know I can.

1378
01:28:53,978 --> 01:28:56,898
I just can't do it
without you.

1379
01:29:08,873 --> 01:29:11,042
It's cool.

1380
01:29:16,216 --> 01:29:20,180
Excuse me, baby.
Uh, do you know what time it is?

1381
01:29:20,349 --> 01:29:23,726
- No, ma'am. I ain't got no watch.
- Oh. Hmm.

1382
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:06,703
It could work.

1383
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:09,456
If she handles
the cops right...

1384
01:31:09,622 --> 01:31:11,626
it could work.

1385
01:31:13,462 --> 01:31:16,131
I gave my heart and soul

1386
01:31:16,256 --> 01:31:19,386
To you, girl

1387
01:31:19,554 --> 01:31:22,932
Didn't I do it, baby

1388
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:26,395
Didn't I do it, baby

1389
01:31:30,403 --> 01:31:32,154
- What?

1390
01:31:32,322 --> 01:31:35,408
- Jackie Brown.

1391
01:31:37,704 --> 01:31:40,457
It ain't like I'm asking you to go
somewhere and spend the night.

1392
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:43,668
I just want you to go out for a little
while while I work this deal.

1393
01:31:43,837 --> 01:31:45,840
So now you're going to pout!

1394
01:31:46,006 --> 01:31:48,261
Now it's going to take her 20 minutes to
find her purse, look for her sandals...

1395
01:31:48,427 --> 01:31:50,430
find her sunglasses,
get outta here.

1396
01:31:50,596 --> 01:31:52,515
Jackie, Louis.
Louis, Jackie.

1397
01:31:52,682 --> 01:31:54,851
That chick you saw stomping
around the back there...

1398
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:58,149
that's Melanie,
who's about to leave!

1399
01:31:58,315 --> 01:32:01,569
Have a good time in there, baby.
Don't burn now.

1400
01:32:01,737 --> 01:32:04,948
- Want a drink?
- No. I want to talk to you now, outside. Now.

1401
01:32:05,115 --> 01:32:08,119
Mm. Let's step
into my office.

1402
01:32:08,287 --> 01:32:10,457
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1403
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:14,588
The day I follow Audrey Hill Clayton...

1404
01:32:14,756 --> 01:32:17,466
- What's up?
...that day, I cut my throat.

1405
01:32:17,634 --> 01:32:20,012
You got that we do it the way
I laid out, or we don't do it at all!

1406
01:32:20,177 --> 01:32:22,139
- What the hell you talkin' about?
- What the hell I'm talkin' about?

1407
01:32:22,306 --> 01:32:24,350
- Sheronda passed the money on to somebody else.
- How do you know she did that?

1408
01:32:24,519 --> 01:32:26,688
- I was there! I saw it!
- You weren't supposed to be there.

1409
01:32:26,855 --> 01:32:29,024
- I knew you would try to pull some shit like that!
- Hold up!

1410
01:32:29,192 --> 01:32:31,360
- I ain't pulling no shit!
- What do you call it, then?

1411
01:32:31,529 --> 01:32:33,782
It's my goddamn money! I can do whatever
the fuck I wanna do with it.

1412
01:32:33,948 --> 01:32:36,117
With my ass on the line,
oh, no, you fuckin' don't!

1413
01:32:36,284 --> 01:32:38,412
- If we don't do it my way, then fuck it!
- Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!

1414
01:32:38,579 --> 01:32:40,582
- Now chill! Chill!
- Oh, no! Chill, my ass! No!

1415
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:43,878
Listen! Listen! The woman
you saw was my friend Simone.

1416
01:32:44,046 --> 01:32:46,381
She's the one gonna be
receiving the money.

1417
01:32:46,547 --> 01:32:49,219
I think she oughta see how the shit
go down. She's a nice woman.

1418
01:32:49,387 --> 01:32:53,057
You'll like her. Matter of fact, she's
on her way over here right now. Hold up.

1419
01:32:53,224 --> 01:32:55,726
Louis, call Simone. Tell her to get
her ass over here.

1420
01:32:55,895 --> 01:32:58,106
We're waiting on her.

1421
01:32:58,274 --> 01:33:01,737
- Damn! Is that what you're pissed off about?
- Oh, just a little pissed?

1422
01:33:01,903 --> 01:33:04,698
- Mm, mm, mm. I'm sorry.

1423
01:33:04,867 --> 01:33:09,037
I'm about ready for a refill. Are you sure
I can't tempt you a little bit more?

1424
01:33:09,204 --> 01:33:11,917
- Come on.
- Okay, fine. Yeah.

1425
01:33:12,085 --> 01:33:14,587
You better give me
something strong.

1426
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:19,802
Now, Nicolet and Dargas are gonna stop
me at the airport and mark your bills.

1427
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:22,014
I don't like that part.

1428
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:24,475
It washes off!

1429
01:33:24,643 --> 01:33:27,938
I tell 'em we do the same thing as
before, and they'll follow Sheronda.

1430
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,822
Yo, Louis. Louis?
She ain't there?

1431
01:33:33,988 --> 01:33:36,742
- Yo! No answer?
- Hmm?

1432
01:33:36,909 --> 01:33:39,372
Now, you gotta listen to this, man,
'cause this concerns you, all right?

1433
01:33:41,585 --> 01:33:43,626
- Lou!
- Hmm?

1434
01:33:45,922 --> 01:33:49,845
Okay, now, this time you're going to get
Sheronda a Billingsley bag, right?

1435
01:33:50,011 --> 01:33:53,015
Right. The same one
Simone gives me, okay?

1436
01:33:53,182 --> 01:33:56,854
Now, Simone and I make the switch in
Billingsley. She knows what I look like?

1437
01:33:57,021 --> 01:33:59,150
She's seen you
with Sheronda, remember?

1438
01:33:59,315 --> 01:34:01,903
All right. Now, Simone's gonna meet you
in the dress department, right?

1439
01:34:02,069 --> 01:34:05,157
- Right. Designer clothes.
- Right, right, right. The place y'all try shit on.

1440
01:34:05,323 --> 01:34:07,409
It's a fitting room. Big sign
over the door. You can't miss it.

1441
01:34:07,578 --> 01:34:09,912
Uh...

1442
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:12,208
Why over there?

1443
01:34:12,376 --> 01:34:15,045
Because they're gonna be
watching my ass hard.

1444
01:34:15,212 --> 01:34:17,882
That's why we can't take the risk
in doing it out in the open...

1445
01:34:18,007 --> 01:34:19,926
or even in the dining area.

1446
01:34:20,094 --> 01:34:22,596
That's why we got to do it
in the fitting room with a woman.

1447
01:34:22,765 --> 01:34:25,269
Okay. Now, you're going to take...

1448
01:34:25,435 --> 01:34:28,105
the Billingsley bag Simone gives you
and give it to Sheronda.

1449
01:34:28,273 --> 01:34:30,317
- Right.
- And Simone is going to wait.

1450
01:34:30,484 --> 01:34:33,029
Then she's going to peep out
the dressing room, wait on you...

1451
01:34:33,195 --> 01:34:35,615
to give her the sign
there ain't nobody watching.

1452
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:37,783
She's going to leave the store,
get in the car, mission accomplished.

1453
01:34:37,952 --> 01:34:39,954
Hey! See?

1454
01:34:40,122 --> 01:34:42,250
So, what are you going
to be doing during all this?

1455
01:34:42,417 --> 01:34:45,212
Now that you got 'em watching my ass, I'm
gonna be in a titty bar waiting on Louis...

1456
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:47,716
to call me and tell me
everything's cool.

1457
01:34:50,302 --> 01:34:53,015
I got to go! Hey!

1458
01:34:55,726 --> 01:34:59,649
- Damn! Who's wantin' to page you like that?
- It's Ray, the A.T.F. guy.

1459
01:34:59,817 --> 01:35:03,154
That shit works my nerves, you and
that motherfucker being so buddy-buddy.

1460
01:35:03,322 --> 01:35:06,658
Hey, if I wasn't so buddy-buddy with
that motherfucker, this wouldn't work.

1461
01:35:08,496 --> 01:35:11,666
Ordell has a guy
working for him named Louis.

1462
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,007
- You two meet?
- Yeah, this afternoon before I came here.

1463
01:35:18,175 --> 01:35:20,511
He was at Ordell's apartment
in Hermosa Beach. Yeah.

1464
01:35:20,679 --> 01:35:22,721
I don't know if he lives there,
but I can find out.

1465
01:35:22,889 --> 01:35:26,350
- Did you talk to him?
- Not really. Mm-mm.

1466
01:35:26,519 --> 01:35:30,439
A fellow named Louis Gara.
Just did four years up in Susanville.

1467
01:35:30,609 --> 01:35:33,612
- For what?
- Bank robbery.

1468
01:35:33,779 --> 01:35:37,451
We've been following him.
He definitely works for Ordell.

1469
01:35:37,618 --> 01:35:40,329
They did two years together about,
I don't know...

1470
01:35:40,497 --> 01:35:43,626
20 years ago or so
over at Huntsville.

1471
01:35:43,792 --> 01:35:46,337
He's not living over
in Hermosa Beach, though.

1472
01:35:46,506 --> 01:35:49,257
Ordell's got him staying
down at Compton.

1473
01:35:49,426 --> 01:35:52,680
Living with some 56-year-old
petty thief, some woman named, uh...

1474
01:35:54,015 --> 01:35:55,975
Hawkins, Simone Hawkins.

1475
01:35:56,144 --> 01:35:57,561
Hmm.

1476
01:35:57,729 --> 01:35:59,606
- You know her?
- No.

1477
01:35:59,774 --> 01:36:03,194
- They ever talk about her?
- Not yet.

1478
01:36:05,363 --> 01:36:07,283
Okay, who's the other one?

1479
01:36:07,452 --> 01:36:10,287
Some white chick named Melanie,
another girlfriend of Ordell's.

1480
01:36:10,454 --> 01:36:13,001
- What's her deal?
- It was her coke I got busted with.

1481
01:36:13,166 --> 01:36:15,377
- Oh, yeah?
- She knows everything. She's not a part of it...

1482
01:36:15,546 --> 01:36:18,257
and she's pissed off
that she's not a part of it.

1483
01:36:18,422 --> 01:36:20,551
Well, this is definitely
somebody I wanna meet.

1484
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:23,221
Okay, are we all set up for tomorrow?
Everything okay?

1485
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:26,060
Everything's the same,
except for one change.

1486
01:36:26,226 --> 01:36:28,229
- I told him Ordell's changing the
amount he's bringing in.

1487
01:36:28,439 --> 01:36:29,605
Think they bought it?

1488
01:36:29,773 --> 01:36:32,568
Mm, oh, yeah. I got 'em thinking
that Ordell's real nervous...

1489
01:36:32,735 --> 01:36:35,405
and they love thinking
that he's scared of 'em.

1490
01:36:35,532 --> 01:36:39,912
You know, a good cop will never let you
know that he knows you're full of shit.

1491
01:36:40,078 --> 01:36:42,916
All he needed was
a reasonable explanation.

1492
01:36:43,082 --> 01:36:45,252
Everything's the same,
except for one change.

1493
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:47,506
What's that?

1494
01:36:47,675 --> 01:36:49,884
Ordell feels way too hot
for him to bring in his money...

1495
01:36:50,051 --> 01:36:52,261
and he knows you're watching him
and he's fucking paranoid.

1496
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:55,140
- So he's sweating a little bit.
- He's gonna keep his half mil where it is...

1497
01:36:55,307 --> 01:36:58,311
but he's gonna bring in 50,000
just in case he needs bail.

1498
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:01,192
- It'll be more than that.
- Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.

1499
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:03,694
You still have to show him
the money at the airport.

1500
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,783
I'm not gonna show him the whole
amount. He'll see 50,000.

1501
01:37:06,951 --> 01:37:09,618
- And where's the rest of it?
- In the bag, underneath.

1502
01:37:09,744 --> 01:37:12,082
- What if he checks?
- He won't. He didn't before.

1503
01:37:12,247 --> 01:37:15,918
He's expecting to see 50,000,
and there it is, on top.

1504
01:37:17,797 --> 01:37:20,761
- You're taking a hell of a chance, kid.
- Not really.

1505
01:37:20,926 --> 01:37:23,430
If he finds it, I'll say
Mr Walker put it in there...

1506
01:37:23,597 --> 01:37:26,268
and I didn't know anything
about it, like the coke.

1507
01:37:26,435 --> 01:37:28,770
- Well, then you're out. You get nothing.
- Yeah, but I'm not in jail...

1508
01:37:28,938 --> 01:37:30,940
and at least I tried.

1509
01:37:31,109 --> 01:37:34,945
You're going to have
surveillance all over you.

1510
01:37:35,113 --> 01:37:38,408
That's why you don't make a move
until I come out of that fitting room.

1511
01:37:38,576 --> 01:37:41,664
- Wearing a dress.
- Well, a suit. There's this one I had my eye on.

1512
01:37:41,831 --> 01:37:43,792
- You know, it's like...

1513
01:37:43,957 --> 01:37:45,793
Excuse me.

1514
01:37:48,466 --> 01:37:50,301
Hello?

1515
01:37:50,466 --> 01:37:52,637
Look here, we got
a little change in plans.

1516
01:37:52,805 --> 01:37:54,932
No, no, no, no,
it ain't no thing.

1517
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,310
Everything's the same,
except one little difference.

1518
01:37:57,476 --> 01:37:59,645
You know that bitch Simone
you saw in the mall?

1519
01:37:59,814 --> 01:38:02,274
Well, she wasn't here today
'cause she done split on my ass.

1520
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:05,112
Yeah. Me and Louis
went by her pad. She's gone.

1521
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:09,202
She's gone, her shit's gone and
my 10,000 motherfucking dollars is gone.

1522
01:38:09,369 --> 01:38:11,371
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't start buggin' on me.

1523
01:38:11,537 --> 01:38:13,541
Goddamn it, I'm telling you,
ain't nothing different.

1524
01:38:13,707 --> 01:38:15,795
Everything's just like
we discussed.

1525
01:38:15,962 --> 01:38:18,216
Now, except for this time
when we make the split...

1526
01:38:18,381 --> 01:38:20,341
instead of Simone
it's gonna be Melanie.

1527
01:38:20,509 --> 01:38:23,262
I think someone's knocking
on the door.

1528
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:27,350
Goddamn it, Melanie got just as much sense as
that bitch has. She'll be in the same place.

1529
01:38:27,518 --> 01:38:30,314
All right.
Yeah, later.

1530
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,444
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna open it.

1531
01:38:33,612 --> 01:38:36,613
I hope he's a good sailor.

1532
01:38:39,911 --> 01:38:41,997
Chicken shit.

1533
01:39:39,661 --> 01:39:41,954
Okay, the envelop contains $50,000.

1534
01:39:42,916 --> 01:39:45,960
I've counted it,
and I'm now marking the bills...

1535
01:39:46,127 --> 01:39:50,548
in the upper left-hand corner in the
second zero with a green felt-tip pen.

1536
01:39:52,761 --> 01:39:54,846
Ever been tempted?

1537
01:39:58,645 --> 01:40:01,105
What? Put one of these
in my pocket?

1538
01:40:01,274 --> 01:40:03,275
Mm-hmm.

1539
01:40:05,905 --> 01:40:08,574
If I did, I'd have to give
one to you, wouldn't I?

1540
01:40:08,699 --> 01:40:11,411
Of course, nobody knows
how much there is.

1541
01:40:11,578 --> 01:40:15,960
I guess we could take as much
as we want. Isn't that right?

1542
01:40:17,253 --> 01:40:19,463
Yes. All those things are true.

1543
01:40:19,632 --> 01:40:23,886
I mean, it's not like
the money belongs to anybody.

1544
01:40:24,055 --> 01:40:26,725
- That would be one point of view.
- Yeah.

1545
01:40:28,395 --> 01:40:31,064
Except it's not a point of view
shared by the A.T.F.

1546
01:40:32,775 --> 01:40:36,029
Once we make this evidence,
it belongs to us.

1547
01:40:36,197 --> 01:40:39,993
You're officially out of trouble now.

1548
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,162
Don't go doing
something stupid.

1549
01:40:42,329 --> 01:40:46,292
How can I do anything stupid when
I'm being watched every second?

1550
01:40:46,461 --> 01:40:48,588
You know, I'm glad
you pointed that out...

1551
01:40:48,756 --> 01:40:50,966
'cause it saves me the trouble
of pointing it out to you.

1552
01:40:51,134 --> 01:40:54,555
Now, look.
Here's the deal.

1553
01:40:54,722 --> 01:40:57,309
I want you to take
all this cash.

1554
01:40:57,475 --> 01:41:00,395
I want you to put it
in this Billingsley shopping bag.

1555
01:41:00,563 --> 01:41:03,067
And that is exactly
what I expect to see...

1556
01:41:03,234 --> 01:41:06,823
when I look inside Sheronda's
Billingsley shopping bag.

1557
01:41:06,988 --> 01:41:08,824
Comprende?

1558
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:11,327
- Sí, comprende.
- Cool.

1559
01:41:11,496 --> 01:41:14,707
Hey, there's only three reasons you
couldn't make your court appearance.

1560
01:41:14,875 --> 01:41:19,171
One, you're in a hospital, two, you're
in jail, three, your ass is dead.

1561
01:41:19,338 --> 01:41:21,341
That means you're not my friend, man.
Why're you putting...

1562
01:41:21,426 --> 01:41:22,176
Winston!

1563
01:41:22,344 --> 01:41:25,180
- Wait. Hold on a second. Wait a minute.
- I'm gonna be gone a few hours.

1564
01:41:25,349 --> 01:41:26,431
Where you going?

1565
01:41:26,515 --> 01:41:29,311
Del Amo Mall. Catch a movie,
maybe something to eat.

1566
01:41:29,479 --> 01:41:31,438
- What you gonna see?
- Something that starts soon and looks good.

1567
01:41:31,604 --> 01:41:33,483
Cool. Have fun.

1568
01:41:33,649 --> 01:41:37,197
- Let's go!
- In a minute!

1569
01:41:37,363 --> 01:41:41,868
You said that before. Let's go!
Found out she couldn't fly

1570
01:41:42,706 --> 01:41:44,833
It was too late

1571
01:41:45,001 --> 01:41:48,878
It's too late
She's gone too far

1572
01:41:49,046 --> 01:41:50,131
Hello?

1573
01:41:50,216 --> 01:41:52,176
Louis? What the fuck you still
doing there, man?

1574
01:41:52,342 --> 01:41:55,389
Well, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm waiting
on her. I'm ready to go, yeah.

1575
01:41:55,556 --> 01:41:58,226
You're the one who's
motherfucking in charge!

1576
01:41:58,351 --> 01:42:00,354
She keeps saying,
"In a minute", right?

1577
01:42:00,521 --> 01:42:02,855
Go in there, grab that bitch by the hair,
drag her fuckin' ass outta there!

1578
01:42:03,024 --> 01:42:05,234
That's my goddamn money we...

1579
01:42:05,402 --> 01:42:07,530
She didn't know
what she was headed for

1580
01:42:07,698 --> 01:42:10,409
And when I found
what she was headed for

1581
01:42:10,577 --> 01:42:13,913
- Hey, we gotta go! We're late!
Mama, it was too late

1582
01:42:14,082 --> 01:42:17,962
- Come on, Mel! We gotta go! Let's go!
- Kiss my ass, fuck wad!

1583
01:42:25,055 --> 01:42:27,724
I play the street life

1584
01:42:27,893 --> 01:42:30,229
Because there's
no place I can go

1585
01:42:30,395 --> 01:42:34,568
Street life
It's the only life I know

1586
01:42:34,734 --> 01:42:36,613
Street life

1587
01:42:36,779 --> 01:42:39,323
And there's
a thousand parts to play

1588
01:42:39,489 --> 01:42:42,743
Street life
Until you play your life away

1589
01:42:44,039 --> 01:42:45,792
You let those people see

1590
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:48,253
Just who you wanna be

1591
01:42:48,421 --> 01:42:52,594
And every night you shine
just like a superstar

1592
01:42:52,761 --> 01:42:56,805
The travel life has played
A ten-cent masquerade

1593
01:42:56,972 --> 01:42:59,644
I love you

1594
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:02,605
The little gold ring
you wear on your hand

1595
01:43:02,774 --> 01:43:04,609
You wanna turn it down?

1596
01:43:04,778 --> 01:43:06,613
I'm listening to it.
Makes me understand

1597
01:43:09,114 --> 01:43:12,786
Louis, man, I've been meaning to
tell you you're a little bit uptight.

1598
01:43:22,884 --> 01:43:26,890
Street life
But you better not get old

1599
01:43:27,056 --> 01:43:28,975
Street life

1600
01:43:29,144 --> 01:43:31,436
Or you're gonna feel
the cold

1601
01:43:31,604 --> 01:43:33,983
There's always
love for sale

1602
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:36,484
A grown-up fairy tale

1603
01:43:36,653 --> 01:43:40,324
Prince Charming always smiles
behind a silver spoon

1604
01:43:40,492 --> 01:43:45,082
And if you're keeping young
your song is always sung

1605
01:43:45,247 --> 01:43:49,921
Your love will pay your way
beneath a silver moon

1606
01:43:50,088 --> 01:43:52,050
Street life

1607
01:43:54,511 --> 01:43:56,514
Street life

1608
01:43:58,643 --> 01:44:00,853
Street life

1609
01:44:02,523 --> 01:44:04,690
Oh, street life

1610
01:44:14,956 --> 01:44:16,958
Yeah

1611
01:44:22,173 --> 01:44:26,515
Ooh, I play
the street life

1612
01:44:26,681 --> 01:44:29,059
Because there's no place
I can go

1613
01:44:29,225 --> 01:44:31,061
Street life

1614
01:44:31,229 --> 01:44:33,524
It's the only life
I know

1615
01:44:33,692 --> 01:44:35,525
Street life

1616
01:44:35,693 --> 01:44:38,028
And there's a thousand parts
to play

1617
01:44:38,197 --> 01:44:42,743
Street life
Until you play your life away, oh

1618
01:44:52,885 --> 01:44:55,386
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Yeah.

1619
01:44:55,554 --> 01:44:58,557
Um, I think I like that suit.
I'd like to try it on.

1620
01:45:03,856 --> 01:45:05,943
Wow! You look
really cool.

1621
01:45:06,110 --> 01:45:09,573
- Hey, it looks cool on me too.
- It looks great.

1622
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:13,078
I mean, you wear that suit to a business meeting,
and you'll be the bad ass in the room.

1623
01:45:13,244 --> 01:45:15,413
Yeah? I think I like it.
I'll take it.

1624
01:45:15,581 --> 01:45:17,917
- I'm in a hurry. Can you ring it up for me?
- Cash or charge?

1625
01:45:18,085 --> 01:45:20,087
Cash.

1626
01:45:41,117 --> 01:45:43,618
- Melanie?
- Jackie?

1627
01:45:43,787 --> 01:45:46,123
Hey, girl, what's up?

1628
01:45:46,292 --> 01:45:49,462
- Hey, are you getting that suit?
- Yeah. You like it?

1629
01:45:49,627 --> 01:45:53,509
- It looks really good on you.
- You got something for me?

1630
01:45:53,676 --> 01:45:56,512
You betcha.

1631
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:14,287
I put a cherry on top.
Booh-yah!

1632
01:46:14,456 --> 01:46:17,877
What the fuck did Ordell
ever do for us, huh?

1633
01:46:18,043 --> 01:46:20,378
Thanks.

1634
01:47:21,881 --> 01:47:24,885
I decided to wear this suit
instead of my tired old uniform.

1635
01:47:25,051 --> 01:47:27,555
- Oh, that's no problem.
- So, how much is it?

1636
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:31,141
- Okay, there's a blouse...

1637
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:33,563
pants.

1638
01:47:33,729 --> 01:47:37,569
Comes to $267.

1639
01:47:37,735 --> 01:47:39,738
Okay.

1640
01:47:41,367 --> 01:47:44,496
- Wait! Your change.
- Oh.

1641
01:47:44,662 --> 01:47:49,000
Uh, by the way, someone left a bag of
beach towels in the last dressing room.

1642
01:49:20,668 --> 01:49:23,506
Ray, Ray, Ray, come out
wherever you are! Ray!

1643
01:49:23,673 --> 01:49:26,511
Ray, come out! Ray, Melanie,
she burst into the dressing room.

1644
01:49:26,677 --> 01:49:28,639
She took all the money
and ran out!

1645
01:49:35,064 --> 01:49:37,524
Aw, fuck.

1646
01:49:37,694 --> 01:49:40,363
Come on.
Goddamn, we're late. Come on.

1647
01:49:40,529 --> 01:49:43,826
- Come on.
- What the fuck?

1648
01:49:43,993 --> 01:49:45,578
We should've been there already,
and we would've if it hadn't

1649
01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:47,038
been for your fuckin' around.

1650
01:49:47,206 --> 01:49:49,332
Jesus Christ, Louis,
maintain.

1651
01:49:52,296 --> 01:49:54,465
- Jesus. Ow!
- Just... I'm telling you, cut the shit.

1652
01:49:54,632 --> 01:49:56,970
Ow.

1653
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:03,354
Idiot.

1654
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,356
- Just let go.
- Straighten up, bitch.

1655
01:50:05,524 --> 01:50:07,442
- You fuckin' mongoloid.
- Fuckin'...

1656
01:50:07,608 --> 01:50:10,655
Oh, now, look at this. This is nice...

1657
01:50:10,823 --> 01:50:13,909
I think I like it.
I'll take it. I'm in a hurry.

1658
01:50:14,077 --> 01:50:15,912
- Can you ring it up for me?
- Cash or charge?

1659
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:17,916
Cash.

1660
01:50:23,756 --> 01:50:27,594
It's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over
and look at this Michi Moon display.

1661
01:50:27,761 --> 01:50:31,265
You just stay right fuckin' here,
all right? Just stay right here.

1662
01:50:31,434 --> 01:50:33,853
Are you sweating?

1663
01:50:35,314 --> 01:50:37,734
Job a little too much
for you?

1664
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:49,083
I'm gonna be over there.

1665
01:50:49,251 --> 01:50:52,462
- You just stay right here.
- 'Cause you're a little bit too conspicuous.

1666
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:56,926
I don't care how conspicuous,
you fuckin' stay here.

1667
01:50:57,094 --> 01:50:59,680
Hey, would you let go!

1668
01:51:04,604 --> 01:51:07,356
- Designer Clothes.

1669
01:51:12,573 --> 01:51:16,369
- Fuck it.

1670
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:44,576
Look, where you goin'?

1671
01:51:44,744 --> 01:51:46,579
- Getting out of here. What do you think?
- Let me have the bag.

1672
01:51:46,746 --> 01:51:49,625
- Fuck you. I can carry it.
- Goddamn, give me the bag.

1673
01:51:49,792 --> 01:51:52,545
- Fuck you...
- What, you're gonna rip the fuckin' bag?

1674
01:51:52,712 --> 01:51:55,463
Give me that bag before I knock
you the fuck up.

1675
01:51:55,631 --> 01:51:58,427
- Take your fuckin' hands off.
- Okay, okay. Jesus, what's wrong with you?

1676
01:51:58,596 --> 01:51:59,890
I'm carryin' the bag.

1677
01:51:59,972 --> 01:52:01,265
All right, you got it. Take a
chill pill, for chrissake.

1678
01:52:01,432 --> 01:52:03,476
Fuck you and your chill pill.

1679
01:52:03,645 --> 01:52:07,731
'Member where we came in?
No, that's towards Sears.

1680
01:52:07,899 --> 01:52:10,987
Where the f...
Which way? Which way?

1681
01:52:14,993 --> 01:52:18,372
Jesus, but if you two aren't
the biggest pair of fuckups...

1682
01:52:18,539 --> 01:52:20,961
I've ever met
in my entire life.

1683
01:52:21,127 --> 01:52:23,837
How did you ever rob a bank?

1684
01:52:24,005 --> 01:52:27,426
Hey, when you robbed banks, did you
have to look for your car then too?

1685
01:52:28,636 --> 01:52:30,972
No wonder you went to jail.

1686
01:52:33,395 --> 01:52:35,895
Is it this aisle, Louis?

1687
01:52:36,064 --> 01:52:37,899
Is it?

1688
01:52:42,780 --> 01:52:44,742
Louis?

1689
01:52:45,909 --> 01:52:48,914
Lou-isss?

1690
01:52:51,877 --> 01:52:54,671
Is it this aisle,
or is it the next one over?

1691
01:52:56,009 --> 01:52:58,217
- It's this one.
- You sure?

1692
01:52:58,386 --> 01:53:01,140
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- You positive? You don't seem sure to me.

1693
01:53:01,307 --> 01:53:04,060
Hey, don't say...

1694
01:53:04,226 --> 01:53:07,230
Don't say anything else, okay?
Keep your mouth shut.

1695
01:53:07,398 --> 01:53:10,734
- Well...
- I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word, okay?

1696
01:53:10,904 --> 01:53:13,157
Okay, Louis.

1697
01:53:22,292 --> 01:53:24,462
See, just where I said it was.

1698
01:53:28,177 --> 01:53:30,014
God.

1699
01:53:41,404 --> 01:53:44,198
In my midnight confession

1700
01:53:44,367 --> 01:53:46,953
When I'm tellin' the world
that I love you

1701
01:53:50,163 --> 01:53:55,797
In my midnight confession

1702
01:53:55,965 --> 01:53:59,261
When I said all the things
that I want to

1703
01:53:59,427 --> 01:54:02,431
Na na na na na na na na

1704
01:54:05,936 --> 01:54:09,109
A love you never knew, girl

1705
01:54:09,274 --> 01:54:14,283
Ooh, didn't I do it, baby

1706
01:54:14,448 --> 01:54:17,871
Didn't I do...

1707
01:54:34,435 --> 01:54:36,604
Can I show you something?

1708
01:54:36,773 --> 01:54:40,109
Not right now. I'm just killin' time,
waitin' for my wife.

1709
01:54:40,278 --> 01:54:44,489
Oh, sure thing. Well, if anything
grabs you, don't be shy.

1710
01:54:44,657 --> 01:54:46,618
I won't. Thanks.

1711
01:54:48,119 --> 01:54:50,498
- Wow, you look really cool.
- Oh, yeah.

1712
01:54:50,667 --> 01:54:54,546
- Hey, it looks cool on me too.
- It looks great. I mean, you wear that...

1713
01:54:54,712 --> 01:54:57,594
- Straighten up, bitch.
- You fuckin' mongoloid.

1714
01:54:57,761 --> 01:55:01,596
- Now, look at this.
- I think I like it.

1715
01:55:01,764 --> 01:55:03,600
I'll take it. I'm in a hurry.
Can you ring it up for me?

1716
01:55:03,766 --> 01:55:06,145
- Cash or charge?
- Cash.

1717
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,613
Hey, would you let go!

1718
01:55:23,170 --> 01:55:25,297
Designer Clothes.

1719
01:56:05,895 --> 01:56:08,731
I decided to wear the suit
instead of my tired old uniform.

1720
01:56:08,899 --> 01:56:11,985
- Oh, that's no problem. I understand.
- How much is it?

1721
01:56:12,154 --> 01:56:16,240
- Okay, blouse, pants.
- And away we go.

1722
01:56:16,408 --> 01:56:19,454
Comes to $267.

1723
01:56:19,622 --> 01:56:22,627
- Here you go.
- Wait! Your change!

1724
01:56:22,793 --> 01:56:27,800
By the way, someone left a bag of beach
towels in the last dressing room.

1725
01:56:52,708 --> 01:56:54,670
Excuse me.

1726
01:56:54,837 --> 01:56:58,592
My wife thinks she left a bag of
beach towels in the fitting room.

1727
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:01,720
Yeah, I think they're there. Go get
'em. There's nobody in there.

1728
01:57:01,887 --> 01:57:04,224
- Thanks.
- Last stall.

1729
01:58:17,409 --> 01:58:19,453
Got it.

1730
01:59:24,376 --> 01:59:27,587
...do it, baby

1731
01:59:27,756 --> 01:59:32,762
I tried so many times
and that's no lie

1732
01:59:34,599 --> 01:59:39,604
It seems to make you laugh
each time I cry

1733
01:59:52,582 --> 01:59:56,045
All right. Just keep drivin' to Ninth,
where all them car dealerships is.

1734
01:59:56,212 --> 01:59:58,047
We gonna leave this heap in
the parking lot and pick up...

1735
01:59:58,215 --> 02:00:00,967
a car the cops don't
know nothin' about.

1736
02:00:01,136 --> 02:00:03,599
Where's Melanie?

1737
02:00:03,765 --> 02:00:05,932
That's what I wanna tell you.
She was buggin' me the whole time.

1738
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:08,645
She got pissy with me 'cause I
wouldn't let her carry the bag.

1739
02:00:08,814 --> 02:00:11,483
And then she started runnin' her
fuckin' mouth about, you know, like...

1740
02:00:11,649 --> 02:00:14,195
'cause I couldn't remember where the
car was parked right away when we came out.

1741
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:17,157
So then she got on me about that.
"Is it this aisle, Louis?"

1742
02:00:17,324 --> 02:00:19,912
"Is it that aisle, Louis?" It was
totally fuckin' with my nerves, man.

1743
02:00:20,078 --> 02:00:23,250
- So, what? You left her there?
- I, I shot her.

1744
02:00:26,503 --> 02:00:28,713
You shot Melanie?

1745
02:00:28,881 --> 02:00:31,761
- Twice. In the parking lot.
- You couldn't talk to her?

1746
02:00:31,927 --> 02:00:34,222
Well, how can you talk to her?
You know how she is.

1747
02:00:34,305 --> 02:00:34,931
You couldn't just hit her?

1748
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:38,186
Maybe, but at that time...
moment, I don't know, I...

1749
02:00:38,354 --> 02:00:40,521
You shot her? Twice?

1750
02:00:42,568 --> 02:00:46,739
- Is she dead?
- I... Pretty much.

1751
02:00:46,907 --> 02:00:48,784
What do you mean "pretty much", Louis?
That ain't no fuckin' answer.

1752
02:00:48,952 --> 02:00:50,869
- Yes or no. Is she dead?
- I think so.

1753
02:00:51,037 --> 02:00:53,497
- You think so? Tell me Louis. Is she...
- She's dead. She's dead.

1754
02:00:53,667 --> 02:00:56,168
- Well, where'd you shoot her?
- In the chest and the stomach.

1755
02:00:57,962 --> 02:01:01,176
If you had to do it,
then you had to do it, brother.

1756
02:01:01,344 --> 02:01:04,012
What we don't want
is that bitch survivin' on us.

1757
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:06,015
Anybody but that woman.

1758
02:01:19,243 --> 02:01:21,078
Louis?

1759
02:01:21,246 --> 02:01:23,081
What?

1760
02:01:23,248 --> 02:01:25,083
Where's the rest of it?

1761
02:01:25,252 --> 02:01:29,506
- How much is there?
- I don't know. Maybe 40. Shit, maybe less.

1762
02:01:29,673 --> 02:01:32,136
Well, you... you said 550.

1763
02:01:32,304 --> 02:01:35,682
Yeah, so you light, ain't you?
You light about half a million, ten.

1764
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:38,059
Look, look, man. That's
the bag she came out with.

1765
02:01:38,228 --> 02:01:40,020
She never put her hand in it.
Neither did I.

1766
02:01:40,104 --> 02:01:40,898
Came out of where?

1767
02:01:41,065 --> 02:01:43,568
The fitting room. It went down
exactly the way it was supposed to.

1768
02:01:43,735 --> 02:01:44,735
How long was she in there?

1769
02:01:44,778 --> 02:01:46,988
A minute. Not even a minute.
She came right out.

1770
02:01:47,157 --> 02:01:49,828
- Louis, you tellin' me the truth?
- Listen, I swear to God, man.

1771
02:01:49,952 --> 02:01:51,287
I swear on my life.

1772
02:01:51,372 --> 02:01:53,538
She came out with that fuckin' bag,
and I took it from her.

1773
02:01:53,707 --> 02:01:54,625
- And then what?
- And that was it.

1774
02:01:54,708 --> 02:01:55,583
We went to the parking lot.

1775
02:01:55,751 --> 02:01:59,213
- Where you shot her?
- That's right.

1776
02:01:59,381 --> 02:02:00,966
Louis, you sure Melanie ain't in
a room somewhere...

1777
02:02:01,009 --> 02:02:01,801
with a half million dollars...

1778
02:02:01,844 --> 02:02:03,929
I worked my ass off to get
waitin' for you?

1779
02:02:04,096 --> 02:02:07,101
- Fuck you for asking me that.
- I know the bitch tried to set me up.

1780
02:02:07,269 --> 02:02:09,311
Fuck you, brother.
How could you fuckin' ask me that?

1781
02:02:09,354 --> 02:02:10,189
She didn't ask you?

1782
02:02:12,774 --> 02:02:14,610
Shit!

1783
02:02:16,613 --> 02:02:19,202
Pull the car over a minute.

1784
02:02:21,747 --> 02:02:23,582
Why'd you ask me that?

1785
02:02:31,467 --> 02:02:34,305
All right, so where's
the gun you shot her with?

1786
02:02:34,471 --> 02:02:36,224
It's in there.

1787
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:41,774
Now, what the fuck's that gonna tell ya?
I could've taken two out already.

1788
02:03:07,643 --> 02:03:10,103
It's Jackie Brown.

1789
02:03:12,314 --> 02:03:15,028
Well, you know, if she got to it,
why didn't she take it all?

1790
02:03:15,194 --> 02:03:17,530
Oh, I'll be sure and ask that bitch
before I blow her brains out.

1791
02:03:17,698 --> 02:03:19,701
Well, maybe the Feds got it.

1792
02:03:19,868 --> 02:03:21,787
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
See, if there wasn't nothin'...

1793
02:03:21,871 --> 02:03:22,787
in that bag but them towels...

1794
02:03:22,956 --> 02:03:25,083
then maybe she didn't get a
chance to take the money...

1795
02:03:25,251 --> 02:03:27,087
out of her suitcase
and the A.T.F. got it.

1796
02:03:27,253 --> 02:03:29,046
But she put them books
in there to trick our ass.

1797
02:03:29,213 --> 02:03:31,341
Well, that's why I didn't check it.
Because the bag felt right.

1798
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:33,930
That's right. And then she
puts 40 grand or so in there...

1799
02:03:33,971 --> 02:03:35,180
to rub that shit in my face.

1800
02:03:35,347 --> 02:03:38,518
You know what I'm sayin'?
She wants me to know she ripped me off.

1801
02:03:38,685 --> 02:03:43,023
Ah. I don... I don...
You know, I don't know. I don't know.

1802
02:03:43,190 --> 02:03:46,363
Unless, you know, either she's
got it or the Feds got it.

1803
02:03:46,529 --> 02:03:49,659
Or... Or...
Now, check this out.

1804
02:03:49,827 --> 02:03:52,663
What if she gave the money
to somebody else first...

1805
02:03:52,831 --> 02:03:55,707
before Melanie even went
in the dressing room.

1806
02:03:55,876 --> 02:03:57,711
Uh-huh.

1807
02:03:59,672 --> 02:04:02,216
- Oh, man. You know what?
- What?

1808
02:04:02,385 --> 02:04:05,139
Do you know who I saw in the
dress department?

1809
02:04:05,181 --> 02:04:05,722
No, tell me.

1810
02:04:05,890 --> 02:04:08,185
I didn't think anything of it.
I... No, no, I did wonder...

1811
02:04:08,226 --> 02:04:09,060
what he was doin' there.

1812
02:04:09,228 --> 02:04:10,939
I wondered what he was doin'
there, but I thought it had...

1813
02:04:10,979 --> 02:04:11,939
nothin' to do with us.

1814
02:04:12,106 --> 02:04:14,693
Like, maybe he was with his wife
or his girlfriend. It's a big place...

1815
02:04:14,859 --> 02:04:17,530
Louis, Louis, Louis!
You gonna tell me who you saw?

1816
02:04:17,698 --> 02:04:20,243
- Yeah, Max Cherry.
- Max Che...

1817
02:04:24,873 --> 02:04:27,587
You seen Max Cherry
in the dress department where we...

1818
02:04:27,753 --> 02:04:30,588
Man, look at me
when I'm talkin' to you!

1819
02:04:30,757 --> 02:04:32,551
You see that motherfucker
in the dress department when we...

1820
02:04:32,592 --> 02:04:33,551
about to get a half million dollars.

1821
02:04:33,594 --> 02:04:34,846
And you don't think nothin'
about him bein' there?

1822
02:04:34,889 --> 02:04:36,265
No. Do they know each other?

1823
02:04:36,431 --> 02:04:38,560
Hell, yeah, they know each other.
He bonded her ass out of County.

1824
02:04:38,725 --> 02:04:41,229
- Well, how am I supposed to know that?
- You know your bail bondsmen.

1825
02:04:41,398 --> 02:04:44,777
You know all them motherfuckers is
crooked as a barrel of snakes, don't you?

1826
02:04:44,819 --> 02:04:46,319
Why should I think something's
weird if I don't know nothin'...

1827
02:04:46,362 --> 02:04:47,529
about them knowin' each other?

1828
02:04:47,570 --> 02:04:48,614
I don't wanna hear no fuckin'
excuses, Louis.

1829
02:04:48,658 --> 02:04:49,490
I ain't givin' you excuses.

1830
02:04:49,658 --> 02:04:52,328
But I'm tellin' you... I don't fuckin'...
I'm givin' you fuckin' reasons.

1831
02:04:52,453 --> 02:04:54,497
Oh, you gonna tell me
the reason...

1832
02:04:54,664 --> 02:04:57,168
you lost every goddamned cent
I got in the world?

1833
02:04:57,337 --> 02:05:00,006
- Hey... Hey, man.
- You gonna tell me reasons?

1834
02:05:00,131 --> 02:05:02,300
- You better...
- Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker.

1835
02:05:02,469 --> 02:05:05,304
The reason is your ass
ain't worth a shit no more.

1836
02:05:05,470 --> 02:05:07,766
You better fuckin'
back off, man.

1837
02:05:14,527 --> 02:05:18,198
What the fuck happened to you, man?

1838
02:05:18,365 --> 02:05:22,703
Your ass used to be beautiful.

1839
02:06:05,012 --> 02:06:07,599
You didn't tell me
you were goin' shoppin'.

1840
02:06:07,765 --> 02:06:10,311
- I thought I did.
- Yeah, well, you didn't.

1841
02:06:18,864 --> 02:06:21,408
You know, if it's me...

1842
02:06:21,577 --> 02:06:24,747
and I got all that shit hangin' over my
head like you got hangin' over yours...

1843
02:06:24,913 --> 02:06:27,042
I don't know,
I'd go shoppin' later.

1844
02:06:27,211 --> 02:06:30,046
Well, I got there early.
You see, I've had my eye on this suit...

1845
02:06:30,212 --> 02:06:32,006
that I've wanted, and, well,
I'm just gonna go try it on...

1846
02:06:32,173 --> 02:06:33,842
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Wait, wait, wait. Just wait a minute.

1847
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:38,182
Just wait a fuckin' second,
all right? Let me finish.

1848
02:06:38,350 --> 02:06:42,854
I got there early. The idea was
to try on the suit, see if I liked it.

1849
02:06:43,023 --> 02:06:45,693
If I did, they would wrap it up,
and I would put back on my uniform...

1850
02:06:45,819 --> 02:06:48,447
'cause Sheronda
is expecting me to wear it.

1851
02:06:48,530 --> 02:06:52,077
Meet Sheronda, give her the shopping
bag with the $50,000 and go home.

1852
02:06:52,534 --> 02:06:54,703
Yeah, but you didn't do that.

1853
02:06:54,872 --> 02:06:57,126
Because I couldn't.
Ray, I swear.

1854
02:06:57,292 --> 02:06:59,962
Melanie burst in.
She grabbed the bag.

1855
02:07:00,087 --> 02:07:02,466
And then somebody
fuckin' killed her for it.

1856
02:07:09,350 --> 02:07:11,728
What happened
to the bag she gave you?

1857
02:07:11,895 --> 02:07:16,235
She didn't give me a bag.
Melanie was not a part of the plan.

1858
02:07:16,403 --> 02:07:18,363
Ordell probably told her to do it.

1859
02:07:18,529 --> 02:07:20,573
That's why she came into the dressing
room, grabbed the bag, took off.

1860
02:07:20,742 --> 02:07:23,578
But I couldn't go after her, because
I was in my fucking underwear.

1861
02:07:23,744 --> 02:07:26,164
And I had to put on this suit because I
could put it on faster than my uniform...

1862
02:07:26,332 --> 02:07:29,085
- You had time to pay the sales chick.
- I had to. Ray, I was frantic.

1863
02:07:29,252 --> 02:07:31,923
What was I supposed to do?

1864
02:07:38,056 --> 02:07:40,435
All right,
what you do after that?

1865
02:07:40,603 --> 02:07:43,271
I went lookin' for you. And I went
back to the place in the mall...

1866
02:07:43,439 --> 02:07:45,568
where you were before,
but you weren't there.

1867
02:07:45,734 --> 02:07:49,072
What was I supposed to do if something
happens? You didn't tell me how to do that.

1868
02:07:49,239 --> 02:07:52,284
There was a guy
with Melanie?

1869
02:07:52,453 --> 02:07:54,288
There was nobody
in the fitting room.

1870
02:07:59,086 --> 02:08:00,921
Okay.

1871
02:08:08,432 --> 02:08:10,519
You've no idea what happened
to the $50,000.

1872
02:08:10,645 --> 02:08:12,729
You're clueless, right? You've no idea
where the 50 grand is?

1873
02:08:12,813 --> 02:08:13,981
I have no idea.

1874
02:08:14,146 --> 02:08:15,524
- None. You have no idea...
- None.

1875
02:08:15,568 --> 02:08:16,734
It could've gone here,
could've gone there?

1876
02:08:16,902 --> 02:08:20,865
I know nothin'. Not a clue. I don't have an
idea where the motherfuckin' money is.

1877
02:08:21,033 --> 02:08:23,328
- Not even a little idea. A maybe.
- Not a tiny motherfuckin' idea.

1878
02:08:23,494 --> 02:08:26,248
- You'd take a polygraph?
- Yeah, if it'd motherfuckin' make you happy!

1879
02:08:26,414 --> 02:08:29,836
Yeah, put it right there.
I'll do it.

1880
02:08:30,003 --> 02:08:31,838
Man.

1881
02:08:40,894 --> 02:08:43,896
I sure hope you didn't do
anything stupid, Jackie.

1882
02:08:48,279 --> 02:08:50,780
I gotta talk to you
for a second.

1883
02:09:07,095 --> 02:09:09,432
Fuck.

1884
02:09:23,619 --> 02:09:28,208
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found
him shot in the car on Ninth.

1885
02:09:28,377 --> 02:09:30,630
And we lost Ordell.

1886
02:09:30,796 --> 02:09:33,466
I thought you were
fuckin' watchin' him.

1887
02:09:33,634 --> 02:09:36,220
We were, and we lost him.

1888
02:09:36,386 --> 02:09:40,141
He walked into a strip bar sometime
around 3:30 and never came out.

1889
02:09:40,309 --> 02:09:45,064
The bar was on Ninth, what, less than a mile
and a half from where they found Louis.

1890
02:09:45,231 --> 02:09:47,569
It looks like Louis' buddy
shot him twice, point-blank range.

1891
02:09:47,737 --> 02:09:51,033
- So what's gonna happen now?
- We pick up Ordell.

1892
02:09:51,199 --> 02:09:54,162
We got three murders
we can link him to, and we got you.

1893
02:09:54,328 --> 02:09:56,707
What about me?

1894
02:09:56,872 --> 02:10:00,045
What about you?

1895
02:10:00,210 --> 02:10:02,546
You think I took
some of that money?

1896
02:10:02,715 --> 02:10:05,051
Hey, I have no evidence
of you doin' anything.

1897
02:10:06,971 --> 02:10:09,557
You didn't pay for that snazzy
new suit with marked bills.

1898
02:10:09,725 --> 02:10:12,769
I'm glad to see that.
You've been helpin' us out.

1899
02:10:12,938 --> 02:10:15,606
You gave us Melanie.
You gave us Louis.

1900
02:10:15,734 --> 02:10:21,323
Melanie was found with a packet
of marked bills stuffed in her shorts.

1901
02:10:21,490 --> 02:10:24,287
That goes a long way
in backing up your story.

1902
02:10:26,789 --> 02:10:29,627
I'll settle for Ordell
with marked bills.

1903
02:10:32,756 --> 02:10:34,966
But if there's
anything else...

1904
02:10:35,132 --> 02:10:40,059
you haven't told me about, you know
what, that's between you and Ordell.

1905
02:10:40,224 --> 02:10:43,270
I just got one thing to say.

1906
02:10:43,439 --> 02:10:46,274
You better hope we find him
before he finds you.

1907
02:10:46,525 --> 02:10:50,113
No, no, no, I done told you,
I can't leave here tomorrow, Mr Walker.

1908
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:55,203
I ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway
till I get my motherfuckin' money.

1909
02:10:55,371 --> 02:10:59,292
Come on, man. If it wasn't for me, you
wouldn't have that motherfuckin' boat.

1910
02:10:59,458 --> 02:11:03,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, right. I'm seein' who
my friends are, motherfucker, right...

1911
02:11:03,966 --> 02:11:07,470
Hello? Hello?

1912
02:11:07,637 --> 02:11:11,475
Motherfucker hung up on me.
Do you believe that shit?

1913
02:11:11,643 --> 02:11:15,815
Ingrate nigger. See, you
bring a motherfucker up...

1914
02:11:15,983 --> 02:11:19,279
next thing you know they breaking
you off some goddamned disrespect.

1915
02:11:19,445 --> 02:11:22,490
Motherfuck!
Shit!

1916
02:11:23,951 --> 02:11:27,162
Goddamn, girl.
How you live like this?

1917
02:11:27,331 --> 02:11:29,751
- Like what?
- Like this.

1918
02:11:29,917 --> 02:11:32,337
This some repugnant shit.

1919
02:11:32,503 --> 02:11:35,841
Bail bonds.

1920
02:11:36,010 --> 02:11:38,345
- Yeah, Max there?
- He ain't here right now, man.

1921
02:11:38,514 --> 02:11:41,350
- Well, where he at? Out of town?
- He's around, man.

1922
02:11:41,516 --> 02:11:43,813
- Well, give me his home number.
- No, I'll give you his beeper number!

1923
02:11:43,979 --> 02:11:46,024
All right. Break out
the beeper number, nigger.

1924
02:11:54,703 --> 02:11:58,123
- Yeah.
- I've been looking for you.

1925
02:11:58,291 --> 02:12:03,297
- Do you know who this is?
- This is Mr Robbie, isn't it?

1926
02:12:03,465 --> 02:12:06,301
I have your 10,000.
That's why you called.

1927
02:12:08,305 --> 02:12:12,186
The bond collateral that you
put down on Beaumont Livingston...

1928
02:12:12,351 --> 02:12:14,771
and moved over
to Miss Brown, remember?

1929
02:12:15,981 --> 02:12:17,984
Oh, she got off, did she?

1930
02:12:18,152 --> 02:12:21,238
They decided to no-file
this morning.

1931
02:12:21,405 --> 02:12:23,617
Tell me where you are.
I'll come give you your money.

1932
02:12:28,207 --> 02:12:30,210
You still there?

1933
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:35,382
Look here, man.
I know you helped her.

1934
02:12:35,550 --> 02:12:37,344
And I know you know
what I want.

1935
02:12:37,511 --> 02:12:41,059
And Jackie can tell me any story
comes into her pretty little head...

1936
02:12:41,225 --> 02:12:46,106
as long as at the end of that story
she hands me my motherfuckin' money.

1937
02:12:46,274 --> 02:12:50,029
Now, she wanna be my friend,
she do that.

1938
02:12:50,195 --> 02:12:52,739
She don't want to be
my friend no more...

1939
02:12:52,908 --> 02:12:56,203
well, you just tell her
to think about old Beaumont.

1940
02:12:56,371 --> 02:12:58,373
And if she go to the police...

1941
02:12:58,541 --> 02:13:02,087
you tell her I will name her ass
as my accessory.

1942
02:13:02,255 --> 02:13:06,632
And we'll go upstate, hand
in handcuffed motherfuckin' hand.

1943
02:13:06,801 --> 02:13:09,930
And that's a promise. Do you
understand what I'm sayin'?

1944
02:13:10,097 --> 02:13:13,476
You tell her that,
and I'll call you back.

1945
02:13:16,774 --> 02:13:20,319
You're right.
It was Ordell.

1946
02:13:20,488 --> 02:13:25,244
If you have time, do you think you could
find out where he's stayin' for me?

1947
02:13:25,409 --> 02:13:27,788
Cops can't locate him, huh?

1948
02:13:27,956 --> 02:13:31,585
They don't have your winning
personality.

1949
02:13:31,752 --> 02:13:35,716
Sure thing. I don't have to know what
I'm doing, just as long as you know.

1950
02:13:35,882 --> 02:13:39,304
I think I do.
Good enough?

1951
02:13:39,471 --> 02:13:41,306
You bet.

1952
02:13:56,454 --> 02:13:58,872
Fuck's wrong with you, knockin' on
the door like the goddamned police?

1953
02:13:59,039 --> 02:14:01,461
- You lookin' to get shot?
- I thought you might be asleep.

1954
02:14:01,627 --> 02:14:04,923
You keep fuckin' with me, you
the one gonna be asleep. Forever.

1955
02:14:05,091 --> 02:14:07,635
I'm alone.

1956
02:14:07,802 --> 02:14:10,640
Get your ass
in the house.

1957
02:14:16,354 --> 02:14:18,274
No, freeze, motherfucker.
What you doin'?

1958
02:14:18,442 --> 02:14:22,280
You want your money?
Your bond refund?

1959
02:14:22,448 --> 02:14:24,615
This all?

1960
02:14:24,783 --> 02:14:26,744
- I have a receipt for you to sign.
- No, no, no, motherfucker.

1961
02:14:26,912 --> 02:14:29,791
You know what I mean.
You talked to her?

1962
02:14:29,957 --> 02:14:32,295
She wants to give you your money.

1963
02:14:32,462 --> 02:14:35,966
If she didn't, there'd be cops
batteramming your door down right now.

1964
02:14:36,132 --> 02:14:38,261
- How'd you find me, anyway?
- Winston found you.

1965
02:14:38,427 --> 02:14:40,346
- How'd he find me?
- That's what he does.

1966
02:14:40,514 --> 02:14:42,350
He finds people
that don't wanna be found.

1967
02:14:42,516 --> 02:14:44,979
Oh, well,
bully for that nigger.

1968
02:14:45,146 --> 02:14:47,273
So, she wanna give me
my money, huh?

1969
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:52,697
Yeah. She wants to give it to you herself,
and she wants to collect her ten percent.

1970
02:14:52,864 --> 02:14:55,993
She also wants to explain
why she had to hang on to it.

1971
02:14:56,161 --> 02:14:58,832
Oh, and I wanna hear
that shit too.

1972
02:14:58,998 --> 02:15:01,835
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.

1973
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:11,389
Why don't you tell me why?

1974
02:15:11,555 --> 02:15:14,893
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already
tried to get Jackie to go in with her...

1975
02:15:15,061 --> 02:15:18,149
split the half million
amongst themselves.

1976
02:15:18,318 --> 02:15:21,863
What she did was take quite a risk
to make sure you got your money.

1977
02:15:22,029 --> 02:15:25,034
And you helped her,
didn't you?

1978
02:15:25,202 --> 02:15:27,746
All I did was walk out with it.

1979
02:15:27,912 --> 02:15:31,835
Y'all went to all that trouble
just to protect my interest?

1980
02:15:32,002 --> 02:15:34,255
In a way, yes.

1981
02:15:36,885 --> 02:15:41,555
My ass may be dumb,
but I ain't no dumb ass.

1982
02:15:41,722 --> 02:15:43,725
Go over there and sit
on that couch.

1983
02:15:45,604 --> 02:15:48,274
Don't worry about her.
She don't even know you're here.

1984
02:15:48,399 --> 02:15:50,735
Sit down.

1985
02:15:50,904 --> 02:15:52,823
Place stinks.

1986
02:15:52,990 --> 02:15:55,033
You get used to it.

1987
02:15:56,412 --> 02:15:59,079
- Where my money at?
- My office.

1988
02:15:59,247 --> 02:16:02,251
- Where Jackie at?
- She's been there since Thursday night.

1989
02:16:02,418 --> 02:16:04,337
If she want to talk to me,
how come she wasn't home?

1990
02:16:04,506 --> 02:16:07,926
- She's afraid.
- Oh, right. That I gotta see.

1991
02:16:08,094 --> 02:16:11,515
She still is. She doesn't wanna get shot
before she can tell you what happened.

1992
02:16:11,681 --> 02:16:14,853
- Tell her to bring the money over here.
- It's in the safe, she can't.

1993
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:16,854
Call her and give her
the combination.

1994
02:16:17,023 --> 02:16:19,274
Look, I'm tellin' you,
you got her spooked.

1995
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:22,863
She won't leave there till you
get your money and you're gone.

1996
02:16:23,030 --> 02:16:24,949
Oh, you expect me to just
go walkin' in there?

1997
02:16:25,117 --> 02:16:27,662
If she wanted to set you up,
you'd be in custody by now.

1998
02:16:27,829 --> 02:16:31,750
When you told her that you'd name her as an
accessory, that scared her more than anything.

1999
02:16:31,917 --> 02:16:35,588
- She believed you.
- Mmm.

2000
02:16:35,755 --> 02:16:38,424
Then that's why she wanted
to give me my money, ain't it?

2001
02:16:38,550 --> 02:16:42,139
It ain't got nothin' to do
with that bullshit about Melanie, huh?

2002
02:16:42,307 --> 02:16:45,810
See, I ain't trust Melanie either,
but I could handle her.

2003
02:16:45,979 --> 02:16:48,399
That was my little
blonde-haired surfer girl.

2004
02:16:50,610 --> 02:16:53,614
And I told that fuckin' Louis all
he had to do was hit her in the mouth.

2005
02:16:53,781 --> 02:16:56,994
But no, he had to shoot her.

2006
02:17:01,291 --> 02:17:03,420
- Jackie's at your office, huh?
- Uh-huh.

2007
02:17:03,586 --> 02:17:06,799
She by herself? That big-ass nigger
Winston ain't there, is he?

2008
02:17:06,968 --> 02:17:09,427
She's all alone.

2009
02:17:09,594 --> 02:17:11,888
All right.

2010
02:17:12,056 --> 02:17:15,727
I call over there,
she better answer the phone.

2011
02:17:15,896 --> 02:17:17,731
She will.

2012
02:17:26,118 --> 02:17:31,123
I'll be here.
See you in a bit.

2013
02:18:08,593 --> 02:18:11,764
Goddamn.
In all the time I've known her...

2014
02:18:11,932 --> 02:18:14,601
I ain't never heard her
scared like that.

2015
02:18:14,726 --> 02:18:17,228
Usually, she too cool
for school.

2016
02:18:17,397 --> 02:18:21,360
Hold up, home.
Give me the keys. I'll drive.

2017
02:19:09,426 --> 02:19:11,929
I didn't know
you liked the Delfonics.

2018
02:19:14,518 --> 02:19:16,186
They're pretty good.

2019
02:19:17,855 --> 02:19:23,737
I gave my heart and soul
to you, girl

2020
02:19:41,470 --> 02:19:46,519
But this time
I'm really leavin' you, girl

2021
02:19:46,685 --> 02:19:51,110
Oh, oh
Hope you know it, baby

2022
02:19:51,277 --> 02:19:54,281
Hope you know it, baby

2023
02:20:14,099 --> 02:20:16,852
Didn't I do it, baby

2024
02:20:26,575 --> 02:20:29,745
Didn't I blow your mind
this time

2025
02:20:29,913 --> 02:20:33,001
Didn't I, ohh

2026
02:20:33,166 --> 02:20:36,545
Didn't I blow your mind
this time

2027
02:20:36,712 --> 02:20:39,300
Didn't I
I got to leave you, baby

2028
02:20:52,027 --> 02:20:54,863
My money's
in that office, right?

2029
02:20:57,367 --> 02:21:00,204
If she start giving me some bullshit
about it ain't there...

2030
02:21:00,371 --> 02:21:02,540
and we gotta go
someplace else and get it...

2031
02:21:02,708 --> 02:21:06,838
I'm gonna shoot you
in the head right then and there.

2032
02:21:07,005 --> 02:21:10,425
Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch
in the kneecaps, find out...

2033
02:21:10,468 --> 02:21:12,387
where my goddamn money is.

2034
02:21:12,556 --> 02:21:15,225
She gonna tell me too.

2035
02:21:15,350 --> 02:21:19,147
Hey, look at me
when I'm talkin' to you, motherfucker.

2036
02:21:22,693 --> 02:21:24,697
Listen.

2037
02:21:24,863 --> 02:21:29,409
I go walkin' in there and that nigger
Winston or anybody else is in there...

2038
02:21:29,578 --> 02:21:32,582
you the first motherfucker gets shot,
you understand me?

2039
02:21:32,748 --> 02:21:34,878
Yeah.

2040
02:21:37,337 --> 02:21:41,093
There ain't nothin' you wanna tell me
before we get out of this car, is there?

2041
02:21:41,261 --> 02:21:46,225
- No.
- Last chance, motherfucker. Are you sure?

2042
02:21:52,192 --> 02:21:54,529
You better be, motherfucker.

2043
02:21:56,365 --> 02:21:58,240
All right.

2044
02:21:58,408 --> 02:22:00,745
Let's roll.

2045
02:22:13,306 --> 02:22:15,183
You got the key, right?

2046
02:22:18,103 --> 02:22:22,317
All right, now, when we get up in here,
you go up in here slow, all right?

2047
02:22:22,486 --> 02:22:24,528
I want you to keep your ass
in front of me.

2048
02:22:24,694 --> 02:22:27,617
Don't be fuckin' around
herky-jerky or nothin'.

2049
02:22:33,751 --> 02:22:36,585
Why is it so dark in here?

2050
02:22:42,262 --> 02:22:46,183
Say, Jackie.
That you?

2051
02:22:46,351 --> 02:22:48,186
Yeah.

2052
02:22:53,318 --> 02:22:55,695
Goddamn, girl.

2053
02:22:55,863 --> 02:22:57,782
What you doin' sittin' off
in here in the dark?

2054
02:22:57,950 --> 02:23:02,081
Ray, he's got a gun!

2055
02:23:21,274 --> 02:23:23,693
He dead?

2056
02:23:23,861 --> 02:23:26,364
Yeah, he's dead.

2057
02:23:26,531 --> 02:23:29,534
Does he have the marked
bills on him?

2058
02:23:29,701 --> 02:23:32,914
He oughta have 40,000
in his pocket there...

2059
02:23:33,082 --> 02:23:36,127
and maybe another 10,000
I gave him.

2060
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:38,298
Why'd you give him $10,000?

2061
02:23:39,007 --> 02:23:40,882
Returned a bond collateral.

2062
02:23:41,050 --> 02:23:44,057
Brought it to him so he
wouldn't have to come here.

2063
02:23:45,433 --> 02:23:47,227
Well, how'd you know
where he was?

2064
02:23:47,394 --> 02:23:49,397
I found him.

2065
02:23:49,561 --> 02:23:52,484
- What do you mean you found him?
- That's my job.

2066
02:23:52,652 --> 02:23:56,863
- You guys didn't tell the police?
- I told Jackie.

2067
02:23:57,031 --> 02:23:59,701
She said you wanted him.

2068
02:23:59,828 --> 02:24:03,123
Ray?

2069
02:24:03,290 --> 02:24:06,960
Remember when you said you hoped
you'd get him before he gets me?

2070
02:24:07,128 --> 02:24:09,423
Mm-hmm.

2071
02:24:09,591 --> 02:24:14,138
Well, you did. Thanks.

2072
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:38,837
Knock, knock. Hey.

2073
02:24:41,092 --> 02:24:42,927
Hey, you.

2074
02:24:43,094 --> 02:24:45,346
I got your package.

2075
02:24:45,514 --> 02:24:48,352
It was fun gettin' a half
million dollars in the mail.

2076
02:24:48,521 --> 02:24:51,774
- Less ten percent.
- Why'd you take so little?

2077
02:24:51,941 --> 02:24:55,568
- That's my fee.
- This isn't a bail bond, Max.

2078
02:24:55,736 --> 02:24:59,282
- I hesitated takin' that much.
- Well, you earned it.

2079
02:25:01,788 --> 02:25:03,915
Well, I'm leavin' now, and, you know,
I'm all packed up, ready to go...

2080
02:25:04,083 --> 02:25:08,629
- That's Ordell's.
- They confiscated everything else.

2081
02:25:08,799 --> 02:25:10,800
Registration was
in the glove box.

2082
02:25:10,968 --> 02:25:13,804
Keys were underneath
the seat. Hey.

2083
02:25:13,970 --> 02:25:17,809
What's the matter? Haven't you
ever borrowed somebody's car before?

2084
02:25:17,977 --> 02:25:20,145
Not after they're dead.

2085
02:25:23,150 --> 02:25:25,318
I didn't use you, Max.

2086
02:25:27,156 --> 02:25:30,243
I didn't say you did.

2087
02:25:30,409 --> 02:25:32,495
And I never lied to you.

2088
02:25:32,663 --> 02:25:36,291
- I know that.
- We're partners.

2089
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:41,299
I'm 56 years old. I can't
blame anybody for anything I do.

2090
02:25:43,595 --> 02:25:46,514
Do you blame yourself
for helpin' me?

2091
02:25:46,682 --> 02:25:48,768
No.

2092
02:25:48,936 --> 02:25:51,522
Look, I'd really feel a whole lot better
if you took some more money.

2093
02:25:51,690 --> 02:25:55,236
You'll get over that.
Where you goin'?

2094
02:25:55,403 --> 02:25:58,156
- Spain.
- Madrid or Barcelona?

2095
02:25:58,324 --> 02:26:01,162
Mmm, Madrid first.
Have you been there?

2096
02:26:01,328 --> 02:26:05,333
- I hear they don't eat dinner until midnight.
- You wanna go?

2097
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:08,671
Thanks, but, uh,
you have a good time.

2098
02:26:08,837 --> 02:26:11,509
You sure I can't twist your arm?

2099
02:26:11,675 --> 02:26:14,930
Thanks for sayin' that, but no.

2100
02:26:15,097 --> 02:26:17,934
Are you scared of me?

2101
02:26:19,561 --> 02:26:21,397
A little bit.

2102
02:26:59,993 --> 02:27:02,495
I'll send you a postcard.

2103
02:27:02,662 --> 02:27:04,665
Will you?

2104
02:27:04,832 --> 02:27:07,167
I sure will, partner.

2105
02:27:25,986 --> 02:27:29,657
You're running a business, Max.

2106
02:27:29,825 --> 02:27:32,119
Cherry Bail Bond.

2107
02:27:34,289 --> 02:27:37,127
Uh, what is it
your son's charged with?

2108
02:27:49,059 --> 02:27:52,397
Yes, that's
a very serious offence.

2109
02:27:54,275 --> 02:27:57,194
Is your son still in school?

2110
02:27:57,363 --> 02:28:01,034
Does his father still live
in the house?

2111
02:28:03,246 --> 02:28:07,877
Could I excuse myself? Would you
call me back in about half an hour?

2112
02:28:12,718 --> 02:28:16,138
Yes, thank you.

2113
02:28:41,046 --> 02:28:44,334
Ooh

2114
02:28:44,501 --> 02:28:46,498
Ooh-ooh-ooh

2115
02:28:46,666 --> 02:28:49,497
Ooh-ooh-ooh

2116
02:28:49,664 --> 02:28:51,994
Ooh

2117
02:28:52,162 --> 02:28:55,326
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

2118
02:28:55,490 --> 02:28:58,574
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

2119
02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:01,822
I was the third brother
of five

2120
02:29:01,988 --> 02:29:06,692
Doing whatever I had to do
to survive

2121
02:29:06,860 --> 02:29:10,898
I'm not saying what I did
was all right

2122
02:29:11,064 --> 02:29:15,184
Tryin' to break out of the ghetto
was a day-to-day fight

2123
02:29:15,352 --> 02:29:19,391
Been down so long gettin' up
didn't cross my mind

2124
02:29:19,558 --> 02:29:24,138
But I knew there was a better way of life
and I was just trying to find

2125
02:29:24,305 --> 02:29:28,261
But you don't what you'll do
until you're put under pressure

2126
02:29:28,425 --> 02:29:31,963
Across 110th Street
is a hell of a tester

2127
02:29:32,130 --> 02:29:35,920
Across 110th Street

2128
02:29:36,087 --> 02:29:40,584
Pimps trying to catch
a woman that's weak

2129
02:29:40,750 --> 02:29:44,539
Across 110th Street

2130
02:29:44,706 --> 02:29:49,325
Pushers won't let
the junkie go free

2131
02:29:49,493 --> 02:29:54,074
Across 110th Street

2132
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:57,197
Woman tryin' to catch
a trick on the street

2133
02:29:57,363 --> 02:30:03,233
Ooh, baby
Across 110th Street

2134
02:30:03,400 --> 02:30:07,229
You can find it all
in the street

2135
02:30:11,396 --> 02:30:14,183
Ooh

2136
02:30:14,351 --> 02:30:19,555
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh, ah

2137
02:30:22,926 --> 02:30:26,757
I got one more thing I'd like to talk
to y'all about right now

2138
02:30:28,506 --> 02:30:32,793
Hey, brother
There's a better way out

2139
02:30:32,961 --> 02:30:37,166
Snorting that coke, shooting that dope
Man, you're copping out

2140
02:30:37,334 --> 02:30:41,206
Take my advice
It's either live or die

2141
02:30:41,370 --> 02:30:45,494
You got to be strong
if you want to survive

2142
02:30:45,661 --> 02:30:49,657
The family
on the other side of town

2143
02:30:49,825 --> 02:30:54,361
Will catch hell
without a ghetto around

2144
02:30:54,530 --> 02:30:58,691
In every city you find
the same thing going down

2145
02:30:58,858 --> 02:31:01,855
Harlem is the capital
of every ghetto town

2146
02:31:02,024 --> 02:31:06,646
Let me sing it
Across 110th Street

2147
02:31:06,811 --> 02:31:11,265
Pimps tryin' to catch
a woman that's weak

2148
02:31:11,433 --> 02:31:15,220
Across 110th Street

2149
02:31:15,388 --> 02:31:18,843
Pushers won't let
the junkie go free

2150
02:31:19,012 --> 02:31:23,966
Oh-oh
Across 110th Street

2151
02:31:24,131 --> 02:31:27,171
A woman's tryin' to catch
a trick on the street

2152
02:31:27,337 --> 02:31:32,708
Ooh, baby
Across 110th Street

2153
02:31:32,876 --> 02:31:34,958
You can find it all

2154
02:31:35,122 --> 02:31:41,201
Oh, oh, oh-oh

2155
02:31:41,370 --> 02:31:46,615
In the street
Yes, you can

2156
02:31:46,782 --> 02:31:49,279
Oh, look around you
Look around you

2157
02:31:49,445 --> 02:31:51,736
Look around you
Look around you

2158
02:31:51,904 --> 02:31:54,734
Yeah, yeah

2159
02:32:00,522 --> 02:32:08,432
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
