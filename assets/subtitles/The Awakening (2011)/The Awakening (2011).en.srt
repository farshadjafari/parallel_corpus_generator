2
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,302
Miss Emerson?

3
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,721
Are you prepared?

4
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,892
I brought this.

5
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,428
Just get it ready. Get it ready.

6
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,530
Life given. Life returned.

7
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,618
Life given. Death lifted.

8
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,957
Take this life force,
consume its ﬂesh.

9
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,082
Open our eyes to what is lost.

10
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,262
<i>Memento mori. Memento mori.</i>

11
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:43,816
<i>Memento mori. Memento mori.</i>

12
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:48,312
<i>Memento mori.
Memento mori. Memento mori.</i>

13
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,154
Who? Whose loss?

14
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,495
This woman?

15
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,173
This grieving woman?

16
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,515
- Darling?
- Oh, God!

17
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,590
Don't look away. You mustn't look away.

18
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,151
Rose? Rose, darling.

19
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,440
I can see you.

20
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,525
I can see you.

21
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:39,530
Life given. Death lifted.
Life given. Death...

22
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,873
Get off me!

23
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,497
Sergeant Evans, the curtains.

24
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,037
The door! The door!

25
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,372
- Stay there, Captain.
- Get off me!

26
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,795
If you're a captain at all.

27
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,626
Sergeant Evans, fetch the others.

28
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,720
You bastard.
You'll kill him!

29
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,385
I'll fetch a doctor.

30
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,057
I'll manage.

31
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,645
- Ah! Ow!
- Another miracle.

32
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,852
Miss Cathcart,
you shouldn't do that.

33
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,648
Cathcart. Florence Cathcart.

34
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,573
How dare you come here
under false pretences?

35
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,572
Is your soldier boy even dead?

36
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,779
And this grotesque charade
won't bring him back.

37
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,670
Neither will your blood capsules
which you slipped from your cup

38
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,170
and your handkerchief as we started.

39
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:36,225
Nor your free hand pulling the wick
from this woman's candle.

40
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,263
As if the dead had
something against naked ﬂames.

41
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,342
You're charlatans.

42
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,348
And poor ones at that.

43
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,098
Get them out of here, Evans.

44
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,604
Get off! You bastard.

45
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,800
- I've got your brooch.
- Oh, thank you, Evans.

46
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,974
Miss Cathcart, when you do these things

47
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,472
you've taken to
ordering me around a little.

48
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,974
I just think with you being...

49
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,651
What, you don't want your colleagues
seeing you bossed by a civilian woman?

50
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,322
Uh, I mean, if anyone was going to
order me around, it'd be...

51
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,492
I mean, if Mrs Evans wasn't Mrs Evans...

52
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,735
But she is.

53
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,792
And she's very lucky, she is.

54
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,662
I won't bully you any more. Promise.

55
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,167
You've never had a child, have you?

56
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,669
No, of course you haven't.

57
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,562
- Allow me, miss.
- Thank you, Katie.

58
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,738
It's all right.

59
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,739
Oh, for heaven's sake. Um...

60
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,163
- Who shall I make it out to?
- I'm sorry?

61
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,162
- Please, Mr...
- Mallory.

62
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,041
Mr Mallory, you'll excuse my brevity,
but this is my home.

63
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,918
- Very glad you enjoyed the book.
- I didn't.

64
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,927
- Excuse me?
- I didn't much like your book.

65
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,387
I found it too certain.

66
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,216
Perhaps that's only fitting
for someone so rude to strangers.

67
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:33,434
I'm a history master
at a boy's prep school.

68
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,686
Forgive my daughter, Mr Mallory.

69
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,439
She's not taking on any more work.
She's quite exhausted.

70
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,781
Um, let him speak, Harry. Please.

71
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:47,452
Um, I'm afraid Harry's right.
I'm really not taking on any more work.

72
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,282
But you are a ghost hunter
as well as an author?

73
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,788
Well, you can't hunt
what doesn't exist.

74
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,620
Ah, well, that's just it.

75
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,632
We think we have one that does.

76
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,973
I need to change.

77
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,143
Katie, will you show
Mr Mallory to my study.

78
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,307
- Yes, miss.
- I'll be fine.

79
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,980
You're fine?

80
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,108
Mmm.

81
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,501
We always know
why you throw yourself into this.

82
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:44,001
And we don't blame you
for thinking that it will help.

83
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:49,632
But every time now, all we can see
is the pain it causes you.

84
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,475
Yes.

85
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,320
I know. I'm sorry I keep
doing this to you.

86
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,323
It's not fair.

87
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,217
"May your skin be ﬂayed from your body"

88
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,386
"in the hell you so arrogantly claim
does not exist."

89
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:36,557
An elderly woman in Dorset,
I seem to remember.

90
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,774
Our school matron
is a devotee of your book

91
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,019
and has told the headmaster
about the work you do.

92
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,567
She assures him you're quite respected

93
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,909
and your book sits alongside the Bible
on many bookshelves.

94
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:55,246
Miss Cathcart,
rumour is a dangerous thing.

95
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:01,124
Conversations in this room
are confidential, Mr Mallory.

96
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,791
Especially if I don't take the case.

97
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,260
Our school is called Rookford
in Cumbria.

98
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,998
Some years ago, a child
was said to have been murdered there.

99
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,733
Not a pupil.
It was a private house then.

100
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,044
Well, who? Did they catch the killer?

101
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,436
There's no record. It was
an important family. All hushed up.

102
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,379
Still, it's perfectly possible
someone died there.

103
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,444
So you're here about a death
that may or may not have happened

104
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,954
however many years ago?

105
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,489
No.

106
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,738
I'm here about another death.

107
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,499
A pupil. Three weeks ago.

108
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,162
His name was Walter. Walter Portman.

109
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,666
The day before he died,
Walter went to see the headmaster,

110
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,839
quaking with fear,
convinced he'd seen a ghost.

111
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,862
The ghost of the murdered child.

112
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,340
Well, how did he know
what the murdered child looked like?

113
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,764
This was taken 18 years ago.

114
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,185
Mr Mallory, this is...
This is an old school prank.

115
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,783
As the camera sweeps across
to expose the plate...

116
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,527
One of the boys runs behind the row
to appear at both sides.

117
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,992
He was still moving
when it reached him.

118
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,860
I know. That was 1902.

119
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,661
This was '03.

120
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,120
'04.

121
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,939
1905.

122
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,041
And, lastly, '06.

123
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,403
All the boys in the school
are accounted for.

124
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,505
All of them. In all the photographs.

125
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:40,139
Including this one,
taken just one month ago.

126
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,054
Miss Cathcart, I can understand a child
running the length of the line

127
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,353
in the 15 seconds it takes
for the camera to make its sweep.

128
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,528
What I can't explain is
how he could get there.

129
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,366
The Millford woman.

130
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,716
Either a batch of partially exposed
photographic plates

131
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,380
or the same ghost was
in my mother's potting shed.

132
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,919
It's half-term in two days.

133
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,683
We'll be lucky to get any of
the children back unless...

134
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,378
I'm not interested in the
commercial fortunes of your school.

135
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,052
There have been other sightings.
The boys believe...

136
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,192
Boys believe in Santa Claus
and the Tooth Fairy.

137
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,182
I'm sure some of them
even believe in God.

138
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,365
You don't need me
to tell you what happened

139
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,901
to that generation of boys, Mr Mallory,

140
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,571
and yet you don't see their ghosts
stalking the halls of your school.

141
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,400
Rookford is a boarding school,
Miss Cathcart.

142
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,903
Most of the boys
are as good as orphans.

143
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,357
I don't say that
just because of your circumstances.

144
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,622
Well, then, why say it?

145
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,625
"Fear is all I remember of my childhood."

146
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,756
"I have glimpses of my parents' death"

147
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,801
"but nothing of our life in Kenya,
nor coming to London."

148
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,970
"Nothing but a feeling
of perpetual black terror."

149
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:04,735
Your tactics are despicable.

150
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,101
" Fear swallows children
and the adults we become."

151
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,603
These boys aren't worried
about bumps in the night.

152
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,943
They are frightened to death.

153
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,289
Please leave.

154
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,122
I was sent to request your help
and I've done that.

155
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,967
You strike me as a woman who won't
do anything she doesn't want to.

156
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,140
I'm at the Wellington Hotel.
Thank you for your time.

157
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,642
<i>Semper veritas.</i>

158
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,151
Latin gives a new school
an air of respectability.

159
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,198
Means they can add a pound to the fees.

160
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,193
And I should imagine a bona fide ghost
knocks it right off again.

161
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,738
Latin puns. What fun.

162
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,577
"Always the truth."

163
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,363
Let's see, shall we'?

164
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,810
You can't wait.

165
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,034
You're that keen that
people believe in nothing?

166
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,036
No, without science
people don't believe in nothing.

167
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,040
They believe in anything,
including spirits.

168
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,043
So we need them. But you don't.

169
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,421
I believe in evidence.
Need has nothing to do with it.

170
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,593
And yet you carry
someone else's cigarette case.

171
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,225
Touché.

172
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,730
I'm sorry.

173
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,527
- Mr Mallory, am I...

174
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,449
Go on.

175
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,035
Judd.

176
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,606
Hey! Knees, boys!

177
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,658
Miss Cathcart, this is Miss Hill,
the school matron. Maud to you and me.

178
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,031
- How do you do?
- Maud?

179
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,170
She's taken this very hard.

180
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,208
She's an odd fish at the best of times.

181
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,337
For a start, she liked your book.

182
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,688
I feel like I know you.

183
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,731
I've read your book
a dozen times at least.

184
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,352
It's on my bookshelf next to the Bible.

185
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,314
I've never met an educated lady before.

186
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,737
Not Cambridge and everything.

187
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,202
Never mind someone famous.

188
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,642
Oh, the Kaiser was famous, Miss Hill.

189
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,040
I... I just wrote a book.

190
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,866
Maud.

191
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,706
Mr Mallory told you to call me Maud.

192
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,420
Maud.

193
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,873
- Hello.
- Hello.

194
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,120
Did Mr McNair not say
all boys inside, Thomas?

195
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,713
Tom.

196
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,390
Everyone's nerves are shot to pieces.

197
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,442
I've been here 14 years.
I know this place.

198
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,563
And I don't hold with
any ghostly nonsense.

199
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,026
I just wanted you to know

200
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,032
I'm at your service.

201
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,751
Hello.

202
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,262
Stop it. Go on.

203
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,362
Howell, stick up for yourself
And get that hair cut.

204
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,384
All of you, downstairs.

205
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,595
Thank you, Maud. I'll take
Miss Cathcart to the headmaster

206
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,097
Came with the building.
It's the boys' favourite.

207
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,617
John the Baptist, I think. This way.

208
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,437
It's actually Judith
slaying Holofernes.

209
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,848
Story of a woman
who stole into the enemy camp

210
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,615
and seduced then beheaded
their highest general.

211
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,909
Hmm. Those were the days, eh, Maud?

212
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,832
- I'm not in, I'm out.

213
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,586
At least I was out. Now I'm in.

214
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,801
You must be the ghost lady.
Come through.

215
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,512
Reverend Purslow,
this is Miss Florence Cathcart.

216
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,649
An educated woman.
Well, well, well. Glad you're here.

217
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,709
Presume you know
you've a matron to thank.

218
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,020
Sol believe. Glad I can be of service.

219
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,686
Child dying before a parent.
Dreadful thing.

220
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,853
I lost three of them.

221
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,815
I imagine you don't believe
in the afterlife, Miss Cathcart.

222
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,613
No, I don't.

223
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,778
Terrible, isn't it?

224
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,328
Mr Mallory will give
you a tour of the school.

225
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:42,207
I'm on my way to the dining room
should you wish to see it.

226
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,052
Mr Mallory.

227
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,307
So I'm the guide now?

228
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,055
He's coming. He's coming.

229
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:04,056
After supper there's an hour of scrubs,
that's compulsory reading to you.

230
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,729
Then lights out at 8:00.

231
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,652
I'll show you where Walter was found.

232
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,473
I'd like to see everywhere
the boys claim to have seen the ghost.

233
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,693
And perhaps you'd ask Maud to join us?

234
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,701
Most of the sightings
were in here, including Walter's.

235
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:29,171
In fact, he was found outside
here on the terrace.

236
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,713
Many of the boys are now
too frightened to come in here.

237
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,926
Mr Mallory.

238
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,549
She doesn't like any superﬂuous sound.

239
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:47,937
<i>"Ego contemno</i> Latin." I hate Latin.

240
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,025
That you, Mallory?

241
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,900
Walter was found there.

242
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,574
Mr Broad found him
just before breakfast.

243
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,080
- And these doors were locked?
- Mmm-hmm.

244
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,799
Did he have a bear or a toy animal?

245
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,593
- It's in the front office, yes.
- Could you?

246
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,974
You don't like him.

247
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,820
I have my reasons.
It would be indiscreet.

248
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,616
Where are his glasses?
He used to keep up the pretence.

249
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:47,325
Used to have a limp, too.
Kept him out of the trenches.

250
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,292
- His mother couldn't bear to keep it.
- Thank you.

251
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,825
And this was still on his bed
the morning he was found?

252
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,672
Yes.

253
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,471
You said there were other sightings
elsewhere in the house?

254
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,636
Yes. Mostly in the west dormitory.

255
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,975
Maud, perhaps I could
leave this to you?

256
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,319
- Why aren't you at scrubs?
- My book, sir.

257
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,821
Are you all right?

258
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,564
And it's half-term tomorrow?

259
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:59,188
Boys with parents in
far-ﬂung places stay behind.

260
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,317
Apart from that,
we have the place to ourselves.

261
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,210
Was he bullied?

262
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,509
They called him "Wheezy Walter".
He was asthmatic.

263
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,332
Who were his friends?

264
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,280
Did he have any friends?

265
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,880
Miss Cathcart, this is a good school.

266
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,349
But if you're different,
the wrong kind of different...

267
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,845
His isn't the only mattress like this.

268
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,936
"Then spake King Arthur
to Sir Bedivere."

269
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,777
"The sequel of today unsolders all"

270
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,738
"The goodliest fellowship
of famous knights."

271
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,012
"Whereof this world hold record."

272
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,611
"Such a sleep they sleep,
the men I loved."

273
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,530
"I think that we shall..."

274
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,742
"We shall never more, at..."

275
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,986
"I think that we shall never more,
at any future time,"

276
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,708
"Delight our souls
with talk of knightly deeds."

277
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,059
Dowden!

278
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,107
Now.

279
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,516
Matron, I presume you've brought this
young lady to my classroom for a purpose

280
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,785
besides subjecting her to the
outrageous behaviour of Mr Dowden?

281
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,901
Mr McNair. Boys,

282
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:39,293
I know you're all upset and
frightened at the moment.

283
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,875
Well, Miss Cathcart is here
to put your fears to bed.

284
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:47,634
She's one of the cleverest people
in England. Miss Cathcarl.

285
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,095
Stand.

286
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,727
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

287
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,309
Sit. Please sit.

288
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:07,158
How many of you did
Walter Portman talk to about this ghost?

289
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:15,746
Well, did any of you
see this ghost boy for yourselves?

290
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,583
I did, miss. I saw it.

291
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,255
Stand, boy.

292
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,833
Would you like to come with me
and describe...

293
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,005
It was horrible.
It was on the upper corridor.

294
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,670
- Wouldn't you rather...
- His face was twisted.

295
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,676
Blurred and sort of twisted.

296
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,007
Like in the photographs.

297
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,310
But he was in pain. Crying out.

298
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,270
It was him. Please kill it, miss.

299
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,691
Yes, please. Kill it, miss.

300
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,526
Silence.

301
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,427
Pocket Premo,
12 exposure pack with meniscus lens.

302
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:50,151
Sound recorder, part Bell-Tainter.

303
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,949
Fumigator for measuring contact traces.

304
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,451
Can Walter's dormitory sleep
elsewhere in the house?

305
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,374
We could move their mattresses
to the dining room.

306
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,786
Marconi magnetic field detector.

307
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:08,215
Third of an ounce of magnesium
and potassium chlorate per tray.

308
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,052
As the wire is tripped the aperture
opens for a thirtieth of a second,

309
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,346
and an electrical charge
ignites the powder.

310
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,069
- What about these?
- Those are footprint catchers.

311
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,566
Ghosts have footprints?

312
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,807
No, people pretending to be ghosts do.

313
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,400
They must hate you.

314
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,903
Who? The spiritualists?

315
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,244
No, the ghosts.

316
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,679
Be quiet.

317
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,436
You'll be quiet or so help me!

318
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,388
Victor, you did the run today.

319
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,139
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

320
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,489
What's this mess?

321
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,739
Will she do what they say? The lady?

322
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,783
And what do they say?

323
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,960
That she'll kill the ghost.

324
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,415
And that one boy a night will die
until she does.

325
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,642
She's not here to catch ghosts.

326
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,006
She's here to catch
naughty boys up to mischief.

327
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,936
Silence now. Eyes closed.

328
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,777
It'll be dark soon.

329
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,195
Parry.

330
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,029
Parry.

331
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,010
Nobody...

332
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,374
Likes...

333
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,705
You!

334
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,911
Be quiet.

335
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,407
You'll be quiet or so help me!

336
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,654
Shh! Keep still.

337
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,722
Hello?

338
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:27,973
I heard bells. Are you all right?

339
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,864
First bell!

340
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,733
First bell!

341
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:44,623
Next three boys, please.
Quieten down.

342
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,077
Next.

343
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,879
Boys who have been seen
can go to their classrooms at once.

344
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,582
They couldn't have
been made with socks?

345
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:57,135
The prints I followed
were definitely barefoot.

346
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,922
- Get back!
- Come on. Come on.

347
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,886
Why are we here, sir?

348
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,302
All right, turn around,
stick your feet up.

349
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,312
Headmaster.

350
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,526
Parry.

351
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,442
- Sir.
- Parry.

352
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,030
What would your father have thought?

353
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,660
The night Walter died,
he got up to use the latrine.

354
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,456
He wasn't wearing his spectacles.

355
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:31,207
Mr Parry here frightened him,
using this to blur his face.

356
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,584
I didn't. I didn't do it to Walter.

357
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,959
And last night he tried to do
the same thing to me. Didn't you?

358
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,553
Victor.

359
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,136
They said if I did it

360
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,854
then they'd be nice.

361
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,770
- Stop snivelling.
- Malcolm, please.

362
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,526
Who?

363
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,108
- Them.
- Scab!

364
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,689
- Quiet!
- But I didn't do it before.

365
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,321
Not to Walter.
I liked Walter. We shared grots.

366
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,697
- Victor.
- I didn't scare him.

367
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,528
- No one knows who did.
- A boy is dead.

368
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,456
- Wasn't me!
- All right, it wasn’t just him.

369
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,370
There was another boy last night.

370
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,585
I saw him down in the stairwell.

371
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,957
What?

372
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,459
Dowden?

373
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,798
- There wasn't another boy.
- Ah-ah-ah. You're behind this.

374
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,717
- Honestly, sir.
- You will name this other boy now.

375
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,590
There wasn't another boy. Please!

376
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,969
You will name this boy or you'll be
thrashed where you stand. Mr McNair.

377
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,346
Honestly. No, there wasn't
another boy, sir.

378
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,725
Please, I tell you, sir.
There wasn't another boy!

379
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,430
Please, sir, I promise,
it was only me!

380
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,856
Wait, stop!

381
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,605
Honestly,
I'm telling you the truth.

382
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:39,483
For God's sakes. You've done quite
enough damage, you will not do this.

383
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,908
What did you say?

384
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,912
You use a balsam for your chest.

385
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,540
I just smelled it on you.

386
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:55,245
I also found it smeared on the glass of
the French doors and on the handles

387
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:56,671
and on Walter's bear.

388
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,918
You were... You were there
the night he died.

389
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,969
I protest. This is...

390
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:06,298
And did he protest
when you found him downstairs,

391
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,804
ripped the bear from him
and left him out in the dark?

392
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:13,351
I came here to protect children
from fear and you...

393
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,978
You are hell-bent
on making them live in it.

394
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,401
- You can't die of fear.
- No.

395
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,564
But you can die of an asthma attack
brought on by it.

396
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,875
- He was alive when I left him.
- Malcolm.

397
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,924
He was crying.

398
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,888
Insisting he'd seen a ghost.

399
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,555
I thought...

400
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,938
I thought I'd toughen him up.

401
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:06,525
It's not enough
to be mollycoddled, Robert.

402
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,699
These boys must be strong.

403
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,408
Stronger than us.

404
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,883
Malcolm, there's not
a man on earth I'd rather protect.

405
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:33,518
But the parents arrive shortly,
and I must ask you to leave this school

406
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:34,970
at once.

407
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,507
♪ Be still, my soul

408
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:17,353
♪ Though dearest friends depart

409
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:32,118
There was a chap in a trench
not far from ours.

410
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:35,284
He used to sing this hymn most sunsets.

411
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,122
It's odd separating the past
from the present.

412
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:50,257
The boys are transformed.
You should be pleased.

413
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,973
<i>Semper veritas.</i>

414
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,722
- Mmm.
- Truth comes at a price.

415
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,559
Ruined a damaged man.

416
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,986
Oh, I'm not thinking about Malcolm.

417
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,405
Nor are you.

418
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,654
I saw you.

419
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,154
As soon as you proved the ghost was
a fraud, something happened to you.

420
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,739
- You were suddenly...
- Please, Robert.

421
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,579
I've done what was asked of me.

422
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,628
Proved there's nothing to fear.

423
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,171
Nothing.

424
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,201
You left church early.

425
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,537
Mr Judd.

426
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,160
You going home?

427
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:06,955
Found your ghost?

428
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:13,712
Another case to write up
while McNair's thrown to the dogs.

429
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,550
After all he's been through.

430
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,310
You know, I wonder
whether any of us really know

431
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,137
what he went through, Mr Judd.

432
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,977
- You shouldn't talk to me like that.
- Excuse me?

433
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,734
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- You think I don't know?

434
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,578
Staying at home was wrong?

435
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,077
Come down here

436
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,334
and tell me that?

437
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,533
Let me tell you something, ghost lady.

438
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,707
It's the living you wanna watch out for.

439
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,551
Not the dead.

440
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:08,020
There she is. Now try to forget
all about it. The headmaster will.

441
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,903
Getting to go home. Cakes and puddings.

442
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,190
Lucky beggars.

443
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,242
Still, we'll have a nice time.

444
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,862
You always say that.

445
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,783
Lucky beggars. You always say that.

446
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,626
No!

447
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,269
There's nothing.

448
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,652
There's nothing.

449
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,312
Goodbye.
See you in a week.

450
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,486
Check the out buildings
before you go, Mr Baxter.

451
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,483
There are gypsies on the Tarrow farm.

452
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,451
Your ma and pa overseas, Tom?

453
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,669
They live in India.

454
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:38,041
Takes three weeks to travel to India.
They have tigers there.

455
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,960
Goodbye, Matron.

456
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,837
Mary.

457
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,548
Have you been?

458
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,474
No.

459
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:51,012
No, but I've seen the lions in Africa.

460
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,682
One of them even attacked me.

461
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,694
How come you're not dead?

462
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:01,735
Apparently I was rescued
by one of the villagers.

463
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,029
Actually, a tribal chieftain.

464
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:05,969
Did he kill the lion?

465
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,196
I was very young. I think so.

466
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:13,330
The villagers took me in
and looked after me until help came

467
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,712
They called me their <i>"Mowa-Zee".</i>

468
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,374
White doll.

469
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:25,726
I wonder what they'd think of me today,
seeing me in such a silly state.

470
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:29,050
- Tom, can you leave us now?
- Were your mother and father with you?

471
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,019
Were they killed?

472
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,000
Afraid they were.

473
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,240
Tom, Miss Cathcart and I
want a grown-up conversation.

474
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:37,934
I like grown-up conversations.

475
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,526
Now.

476
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,941
Goodbye, Mowa-Zee.

477
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:55,251
Maud, it was an accident.

478
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,211
I lost my cigarette case.

479
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,411
How could someone like you
want to do such a thing?

480
00:49:59,412 --> 00:50:00,756
I don't want to talk about it.

481
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,296
Don't go. Miss,
something has happened to you.

482
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,919
You can't leave this house now.

483
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:08,093
Please stop calling me miss.
It's Florence.

484
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,887
And I can't stay here.

485
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,932
I'm sorry.

486
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,488
Thank you.

487
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:36,997
I'll be gone in an hour.

488
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,760
I fell.

489
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,340
I fell.

490
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,829
I know you're there, Robert.

491
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,956
Please don't go away.

492
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,593
Don't go.

493
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,832
<i>You must be the ghost lady.</i>

494
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,081
<i>Come through.</i>

495
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,990
<i>Good evening.</i>

496
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,712
<i>Good evening.</i>

497
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,321
<i>Be quiet.</i>

498
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,289
<i>You'll be quiet or so help me!</i>

499
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,594
Mr Mallory, I need your help.

500
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,066
You're not going?

501
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,963
Some of the equipment needs resetting.

502
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,461
- Can I...
- I don't understand.

503
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,800
You have your culprit.
You're doing more?

504
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,306
- Oh, would you...
<i>- </i> No, thank you.

505
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,147
Don't you like sherry?

506
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,470
I need to keep my wits about me.

507
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,610
I don't think
I shall ever drink alcohol.

508
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,275
- It makes you cross and sick.
- Mr Judd,

509
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,686
you're welcome to join us.

510
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,197
Things to do, Matron.

511
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,316
Mallory.

512
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,906
Mr Mallory.

513
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:48,993
Florence, what are you doing?

514
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,416
I was brought here
to explain a phenomenon in this house,

515
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,836
and whatever everyone else may believe,
I have yet to do that.

516
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:58,374
A collective delusion
has been experienced here,

517
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:02,173
a child moving through the house
as if there were no walls or ﬂoors.

518
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,722
You said that a child was murdered here.

519
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,512
What if that was also caused by...

520
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,593
You're doing this because of a feeling?

521
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,020
- This morning, you were...
- This is not a feeling!

522
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,190
This is a thesis. It's science.

523
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,023
- Tell me about the original murder.
- One can't even be sure there was one.

524
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:22,731
- Something is causing this.
- Two hours ago, you...

525
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,406
- Florence, why are you doing this?
- Florence.

526
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,626
- What is it?
- A differential thermometer.

527
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:38,043
It means this side of the corridor
has suddenly become

528
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,378
much colder than that side.

529
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,927
You said this was a private house.

530
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,761
Housemaids often had hidden cupboards

531
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:52,728
for mops and brooms and so forth.

532
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:02,062
May even be stairs to the upper levels.

533
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,945
I know this.

534
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,780
It's an old nursery rhyme.

535
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,787
Ladybird, ladybird,

536
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,039
ﬂy away home.

537
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,130
Your house is on fire.

538
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,043
Your children are gone.

539
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,219
All except one.

540
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,230
We need to work. Lock the house.

541
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,649
- Florence, you don't need...
- Robert, lock the house.

542
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,572
This is nothing,
it's a silly nursery rhyme.

543
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,399
I'm frightened.

544
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,530
Tom.

545
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,028
- Tom.
- He wants to get me.

546
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,998
Tom, nothing is going
to happen to you. Nothing.

547
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,326
I promise you that.

548
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,501
Now I must work.
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

549
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,382
Can I sit with you? I won't talk.

550
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,217
Of course.

551
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:40,061
I get in trouble for talking.

552
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:44,933
But I don't talk much.

553
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,611
Did you have any friends at school?

554
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,107
You can talk to me.

555
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,705
I have make-believe friends. Sometimes.

556
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:02,577
There's nothing wrong with that.
Many children do. I know I did.

557
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,250
What was his name?

558
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,630
I'm not sure he had a name.

559
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:15,093
- Do yours have names?
- You're still lonely.

560
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:16,594
Aren't you?

561
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,682
I can tell.

562
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,977
With the boys at school, too,

563
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,107
I can tell.

564
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,903
You had a real friend once.

565
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,315
And you don't any more.

566
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,777
Did you love him or something?

567
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:43,534
Yes, I loved him.

568
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,580
He was a very kind man,
a very good man.

569
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,588
But I was...

570
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:01,302
I did something
very silly and very cruel.

571
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,687
I think I was frightened of losing him,
I loved him so much.

572
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,237
He was in the war.

573
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:14,948
What did you do?

574
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,738
I wrote to him and told him

575
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,286
I couldn't marry him
and I didn't love him any more.

576
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,581
What did he say?

577
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,461
He died.

578
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:31,965
Not long after he got the letter.

579
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,883
But you did love him.

580
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,795
That's why you want him back.

581
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,862
Thank you. Mowa-Zee.

582
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,914
I don't think there's a place on earth

583
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:08,039
people understand loneliness
better than here.

584
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:29,523
You're torturing yourself.
Is that what you're doing here?

585
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,767
Proving again and again
that he's really gone?

586
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,607
- Twisting the blade in deeper?
- You tell me.

587
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:35,861
Why? Is it guilt?

588
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,439
Preaching to me while
you rip your leg to shreds

589
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,991
as if that'll make you feel better
for having survived!

590
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,041
You don't know what
you're talking about.

591
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,878
Robert.

592
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:58,839
I'm frightened.

593
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,012
And I can't live with that.

594
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:03,177
And yes, you're right,
what I do comes at a price.

595
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,886
I hate myself more and more,
but I can't live with fear.

596
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,438
I'd sooner be dead myself.

597
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:26,260
Red four
goes on the black five.

598
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,889
Every card has its place.

599
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:32,687
When they're back where they should be,
you win the game.

600
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,356
And that goes there.

601
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,064
That one there.

602
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:43,319
Black eight can go on red nine.

603
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,443
It takes time.

604
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,533
That's why they call it "patience".

605
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,414
She's downstairs.

606
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,667
- Mowa-Zee.
- Tom. Tom!

607
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,669
Tom!

608
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,423
I know it's you, Tom.

609
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,005
I won't chase you.

610
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,010
Keep playing.

611
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,016
Florence.

612
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,393
Why are you doing this? You!

613
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:27,194
I heard you giggle.

614
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,692
- I heard him giggle.
- Florence!

615
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,399
You took me to a man.
Who was he? Who was he?

616
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:34,660
There was a... There was a man!
There was... There was a man!

617
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:35,828
Stop this!

618
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,497
It's... It's all of you!

619
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,495
You're all doing this!

620
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:42,035
You, you...

621
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,288
You cruel and horrid little boy.

622
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,215
Florence!

623
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,880
I hate you.

624
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,389
Thomas Hill, you will come back here
at once and apologise.

625
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,851
Stop bossing me around.
I haven't done anything wrong.

626
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,144
I don't recognise you.

627
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:07,648
I thought you were a kind,
loving girl but there's...

628
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,693
There's nothing left.

629
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,987
You're a shell.

630
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,217
<i>She's very troubled.</i>

631
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,012
You have to understand that.

632
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,695
She likes you very, very much.

633
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,868
She doesn't care about me.

634
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:04,701
I may as well be dead like Walter.

635
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,125
I hate her.

636
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,614
Robert, I need your help.

637
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:45,121
He had a shotgun, and he was there,

638
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,831
and one of these will prove it.

639
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:56,969
I can leave an amber light on,
but are you...

640
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,344
I'll be fine.

641
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:15,105
If you could just lift them.

642
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:19,446
That's good.

643
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:23,534
The dark used to bother me.

644
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,868
Later, of course, it came to mean
safety, no sniper fire, or...

645
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,545
- Thank you.
- ...shells, but

646
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:35,000
as a lad I'd huddle into my bed,

647
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:40,969
wanting to see what was there
but too frightened to open my eyes.

648
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:44,968
Thank you.

649
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:49,727
It's never darker than when we close
our eyes and yet we keep them shut.

650
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:54,898
Why is that?

651
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,148
Thank you.

652
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,921
The motion's not blurred,
so even if he's moving

653
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:15,589
one of these will have him clearly.

654
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:18,209
Why do you keep
your eyes closed, Florence?

655
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,592
Where is he?

656
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,564
Oh, God.

657
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:41,778
No.

658
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:33,891
You're real.

659
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:39,771
I am.

660
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:49,736
Why are these things here?
What do they want with me?

661
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,747
Maybe they aren't here for you.

662
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:18,268
Tom, stay here. Do not leave this room.

663
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,292
No! No! No!

664
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:12,629
Open the door.

665
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,243
Have you left this room?
Something's happened to Florence.

666
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:39,910
- Promise me you'll stay here.
- All right.

667
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,411
Tom!

668
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,912
I promise.

669
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:48,498
Maud! Florence!

670
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:56,759
I saw you.

671
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,346
I saw you with him.

672
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,432
The war hero.

673
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,104
I don't know what you...

674
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:08,526
I've seen plenty through these windows
making my rounds, but never that.

675
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:14,816
Women. Just lap up
the sob stories, don't you?

676
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,368
They were sent, you know.
They didn't sign up.

677
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,487
Suddenly they're heroes.

678
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,205
How dare you!

679
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:29,663
You did nothing,

680
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:31,882
and you think you can mock men like him?

681
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,675
You take care of what you're saying.

682
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:38,055
You did... You did nothing
when men gave every...

683
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:14,375
No!

684
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:42,379
Robert! Robert!

685
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,175
Whatever happened?
What's happened, Florence?

686
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,680
- Florence, what is it? My darling girl!
- Florence!

687
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:50,930
Judd attacked me.

688
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:56,273
He tried to... He tried to...
I think I killed him.

689
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:58,821
- I think I killed him.
- Maud, get a blanket.

690
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:00,443
And run a bath. Now, please.

691
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,365
Where? Where's Judd?

692
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:04,944
By the trees at the end of the driveway.

693
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:09,122
No, go inside. Get to Maud
and stay there. You hear?

694
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:17,749
Robert. Robert, don't tell Tom.

695
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:19,546
Tom?

696
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:22,419
Little Tom. He's frightened enough.
He's the only child here.

697
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:25,632
Florence, there are no children here.
It's just us three!

698
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:28,976
What?

699
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:04,674
<i>Mowa-Zee.</i>

700
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,215
<i>Mowa-Zee.</i>

701
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:15,772
<i>Mowa-Zee.</i>

702
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,292
<i>Mowa-Zee.</i>

703
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:11,036
<i>I didn't mean to
scare Walter that night.</i>

704
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:16,325
I know.

705
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,330
I believe you.

706
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:52,194
You can control that?

707
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:54,621
Sometimes I can.

708
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:58,208
But I don't know why he could see me.

709
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:01,373
No one sees me.

710
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,210
I can't make them.

711
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,589
We see what we need to.

712
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,046
He needed a friend.

713
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,470
So did I.

714
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,850
But you were frightened. When you
heard the music from that rabbit doll,

715
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:20,147
you said someone was going to get you.

716
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,224
- Who were you frightened of'?
- I can't tell you.

717
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,935
Please. Tell me, please.

718
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:26,736
You have to see for yourself.

719
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:30,191
It's the only way we can be together.

720
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:33,201
Again.

721
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:36,947
What?

722
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:39,332
Promise you won't go away again.

723
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:41,747
Mousie.

724
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:43,579
Mow-zee?

725
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:47,838
Look at the doll's house. Look at it.

726
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:52,091
- No.
- You started to remember,

727
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:53,387
- I know you did.
- No.

728
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:54,840
Look at it. You'll remember the rest.

729
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,095
- Look at it.
- I don't want to look.

730
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:58,552
You started to remember, I know you did.
Look at the house.

731
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:01,556
- I don't want to look! Get away from me!
- Look at the house.

732
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:16,161
<i>Mousie.</i>

733
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:18,330
<i>You started to remember!
You started!</i>

734
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,869
<i>You started to remember!
I know you did!</i>

735
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,624
<i>But you go on and on!</i>

736
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:31,210
<i>I don't even wanna look at you!
I can't live like this!</i>

737
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:34,012
<i>Look at it.
You'll remember the rest.</i>

738
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:42,597
<i>You don't know! You scheme
and you laugh at me and plot!</i>

739
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:46,149
<i>No one is plotting.
It's just that we can't care any more.</i>

740
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:49,273
<i>You make it impossible to care.
You don't speak for days.</i>

741
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:51,776
<i>You don't speak to me.
You won't even look at her.</i>

742
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,614
Be quiet. You will be quiet,
or so help me!

743
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:02,620
Your own child?
You despise her.

744
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:05,293
- You're a monster!
- She's not a boy!

745
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:07,747
She's bright,
and she's sweet, and she's...

746
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,254
- Give me a son! Stay here!
- You have one!

747
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:19,341
How do you think that makes me fee!
Watching your bastard boy

748
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,893
running around with... Your bastard boy
running around with Florence!

749
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,222
Leave Tom out of this!

750
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:30,736
...making us pay because you...

751
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:32,904
Mummy! Mummy!

752
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:41,163
Stay back, Florence.
You can't help Mummy now.

753
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,032
Move out of the way!

754
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:51,586
You can't help Mummy now.
Move out of the way!

755
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:01,638
You can't help Mummy now.
Move out of the way!

756
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,149
I need you to move out of the way.

757
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:16,023
Please, Daddy.

758
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:19,659
Mousie, Mousie, run! Run!

759
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:33,332
Think I don't know
your little hiding places?

760
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:39,425
Know where my little mouse
hides herself for hours on end?

761
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,622
Little Mousie.

762
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,003
Little Mousie.

763
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:28,137
I really am sorry, Little Mousie.

764
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:40,775
I will find you, darling.

765
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:49,245
You have to go with Mummy now.

766
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:35,624
Mousie.

767
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:39,378
Mousie.

768
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:43,511
Little Mousie.

769
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:28,806
You never said school.

770
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:37,274
From the moment you arrived,
you called this place a house.

771
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:41,899
You, nanny.

772
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,110
Tom's mother.

773
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:47,284
I thought bringing you here
would be enough.

774
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:50,578
But you didn't remember me,
let alone the terrible things.

775
01:30:51,237 --> 01:30:54,116
I knew your little mind had
blacked it all out.

776
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:56,577
But one thing kept me certain.

777
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:59,204
You saw him.

778
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:02,166
You saw my...

779
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:04,922
My

780
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:07,549
darling

781
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:10,257
murdered child,

782
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:16,601
who's lived here all these years
with friends he could never have.

783
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:20,270
I was his friend.

784
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:24,188
We shared everything.

785
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:26,652
A father,

786
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:28,695
everything.

787
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:30,656
But you needed to see.

788
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:35,078
That's why I sent Tom
to frighten you those times.

789
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:39,202
To make you stay.

790
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:41,622
Because I know what's best for you.

791
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:43,332
I always did.

792
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,835
Because I raised you.

793
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:49,591
I wet-nursed you.

794
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:52,594
I watched you

795
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:54,635
taken away,

796
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:57,971
adopted.

797
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:03,273
You were ripped from me
like my boy had been.

798
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:09,570
I never asked anything of the world.

799
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:13,658
And it's a perfect hell on earth

800
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:19,960
to give a woman children to love

801
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:22,792
and to rob her of them.

802
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:42,307
Little Tom.

803
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:45,394
Little Tom.

804
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,552
I'd forgotten everything.

805
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:21,017
Well, perhaps not everything.

806
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:24,724
"Eaten by lions."

807
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:29,821
Well, all memories are
a hoax of some sort.

808
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:33,401
You can't blame anyone
for letting you believe that one.

809
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:35,906
Mmm.

810
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:42,538
You needn't worry.

811
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:46,754
No one will find Judd's body.

812
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:52,172
I've buried better men than him.

813
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,266
You see your own ghosts, too?

814
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:10,361
Are they with us now?

815
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:21,782
Your friends.

816
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:28,500
They look like my friends.

817
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:30,965
They don't have the right.

818
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:34,590
No amount of guilt deserves
the pain you inﬂict on yourself.

819
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:37,548
- They died. I lived.
- No, you didn't.

820
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:40,137
A life haunted

821
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:43,678
isn't a life at all.

822
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:46,643
We may as well

823
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:50,564
be ghosts ourselves.

824
01:34:56,816 --> 01:34:59,160
Light a fire, get some glasses.

825
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:22,468
Someone once told me
it makes one cross and sick.

826
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:42,704
Tom, what... What is it? What's wrong?

827
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,702
Mother said it would be all right.

828
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,165
She said that you would want us to.

829
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:53,089
The loneliest boys are
starting to see Tom now,

830
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:56,714
but will he listen to me?
Will he hide? He needs you.

831
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:01,639
Maud, I'm going home.

832
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:03,762
Imagine what a fright you gave me
going in the lake like that

833
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,593
before you saw the truth.

834
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:09,100
But it's all right now.

835
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:12,851
Because he can have you forever.

836
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:15,020
Everything in its place.

837
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:18,527
Maud

838
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:21,571
knows best.

839
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,907
Robert!

840
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,620
Florence?

841
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:32,792
- Florence?
- Mr Mallory!

842
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:36,625
Florence and I will be leaving now.

843
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:39,677
Tom needs his family with him.

844
01:36:40,503 --> 01:36:42,551
Florence? Florence?

845
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:46,601
Robert, the medicine cabinet
in Maud's room. Quickly.

846
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:49,471
Something to make me sick.
Something to make me sick.

847
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:52,649
Oh, God! No! No!

848
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:58,316
Tom?

849
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:02,241
Tom?

850
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:09,954
Don't be angry,
I just miss you.

851
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:12,251
All the time.

852
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:18,257
My whole life I've never been happy,
not one second since you left me.

853
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:23,505
But I can't... I can't... I can't come.

854
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:25,427
You know that, don't you?

855
01:37:28,217 --> 01:37:30,265
You're the only friend I've ever had.

856
01:37:32,722 --> 01:37:36,317
But if I go with you now,
my soul will never be happy, and I...

857
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:40,025
I can be, thanks to you.

858
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:42,657
But you won't need me.

859
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:45,109
No one will need me.

860
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:48,705
Tom, you must be brave.

861
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:53,160
Can you move through the house
like there are no walls?

862
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,412
No walls and no ﬂoors.

863
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:57,168
Help her, help her, help her!

864
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:59,707
Then ﬂy, little Tom.

865
01:38:01,751 --> 01:38:03,173
Fly.

866
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:24,941
Are you dead?

867
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:27,906
Are you dying?

868
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:30,075
I don't know.

869
01:38:31,364 --> 01:38:32,911
I need to sleep.

870
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,249
I need to close my eyes.

871
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:40,085
I'll stay with you.

872
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:42,504
I promise.

873
01:38:43,709 --> 01:38:45,757
Even if you can't see me.

874
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:50,053
I can...

875
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:53,053
I can feel you now.

876
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:53,825
I'll tell the boys
it was an accident, of course.

877
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:56,203
They'll be devastated. They adored her.

878
01:39:56,449 --> 01:39:58,668
We all did. Uh-uh-uh.

879
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:03,169
I can only think the Walter incident
hit her harder than we thought.

880
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:06,259
Mind you,
the Cathcart girl didn't help.

881
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:08,882
I suspect she wasn't
altogether well herself.

882
01:40:10,213 --> 01:40:12,307
You know, I read a study last term.

883
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:15,681
Ladies' minds often can't cope
with further education.

884
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:32,527
I know you're there.

885
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:35,663
That's more than your headmaster does.

886
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:45,005
I used to play here.

887
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:46,674
Hide and seek.

888
01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:48,342
She would...

889
01:40:49,168 --> 01:40:52,172
Maud would sit over there.

890
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,433
I'm thinking of writing another book.

891
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:07,069
<i>The Interpretation of Ghosts.</i>

892
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:10,198
Oh, God help us.

893
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:14,197
Victor, do your laces.

894
01:41:18,781 --> 01:41:21,250
- Hello.
- Hello, again.

895
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:26,209
Actually, Robert,
can you tell the driver to wait for me

896
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:27,507
at the end of drive?

897
01:41:27,707 --> 01:41:29,175
I like the walk.

898
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:31,211
I always have.

899
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:33,925
Till Saturday week.

900
01:41:44,015 --> 01:41:45,688
Not seeing them...

901
01:41:47,727 --> 01:41:49,900
It's not the same as forgetting.

902
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:55,367
It isn't.

903
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:10,924
- Hello.
- Hello.
