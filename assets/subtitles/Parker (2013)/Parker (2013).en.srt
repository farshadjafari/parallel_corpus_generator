1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:05,504
[silence]

2
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,162
- Excuse me, Dr. King?
- I'm sorry.

3
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:32,498
I don't have any more time.
I'm already late for my plane.

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,867
My name's Annie Parker.

5
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,773
Oh.

6
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:43,242
I read your letters.

7
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,711
I heard you were in town.

8
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,913
I tried to catch
your lecture, but...

9
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,248
the traffic was horrible.

10
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,216
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

11
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,787
It was a bit dry.
My jokes didn't
play very well.

12
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,325
- That's a pretty necklace.
- Thank you.

13
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,796
It was my mom's.
I had it restrung recently.

14
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,432
- You know, she--
- Hey, I'm sorry.

15
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:09,802
I really do have to go.
I hope we can speak again.

16
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:12,704
All the best.

17
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,760
Oh, you might
feel some discomfort.

18
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,728
Just relax.

19
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:51,009
<i>[Annie]</i>
<i>There are great mysteries</i>
<i>out there.</i>

20
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:54,379
<i>Strange and magical,</i>

21
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,782
<i>hidden in codes.</i>

22
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,019
<i>Did you ever wonder...</i>

23
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,788
<i>if you knew those codes,</i>

24
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,624
<i>could you change</i>
<i>your future?</i>

25
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,227
<i>[heartbeats]</i>

26
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,878
- Slap.
- Snap.

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,248
<i>That's my big sister</i>
<i>Joan and I.</i>

28
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,716
<i>She knew things.</i>

29
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:34,419
That's where Death hides
when he comes to the house.

30
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,221
He sleeps most of the time.

31
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,890
But you should be very quiet
when you're up here

32
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:40,726
so you don't wake him up.

33
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,564
Did Mommy wake him up?

34
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,367
Yes, she did.

35
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:56,208
She blew it, and now
we don't have a mommy anymore.

36
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,648
And he'll get us too
if we're not careful,

37
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,983
like he did Grandma
and Aunt Lil.

38
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,390
- Snap.
- Snap.

00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,926

<i>so I would make up for it</i>
<i>by making bad choices.</i>

59
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,196
<i>That's my sister Joan</i>
<i>all grown up.</i>

60
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,532
<i>And that's Joan's</i>
<i>best friend Louise,</i>

61
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,601
<i>who my dad said was trouble</i>
<i>with a capital T,</i>

62
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,038
<i>which made Joan,</i>
<i>who was always good,</i>
<i>like her even more.</i>

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,507
<i>That's Paul,</i>
<i>who was sweet and funny.</i>

64
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,311
<i>We fell in love and got engaged</i>
<i>when I was only 18--</i>

65
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,381
<i>always a good idea--</i>
<i>and later got married</i>

66
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,916
<i>because he was sweet</i>
<i>but also because</i>
<i>he had a great ass</i>

67
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,286
<i>which was like a piece</i>
<i>of pneumatic machinery.</i>

68
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,888
<i>Thumpity thumpity</i>
<i>thumpity thump.</i>

69
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,790
<i>Thumpity</i>
<i>thumpity thump.</i>

70
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,526
<i>He was going to be</i>
<i>a musician, which is hard,</i>

71
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:58,463
<i>so until then, he was</i>
<i>working as a pool cleaner...</i>

72
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,433
<i>in Toronto.</i>

73
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,336
<i>My dad died suddenly</i>
<i>in 1972.</i>

74
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:08,307
<i>I guess that's where</i>
<i>we should start.</i>

75
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,008
[Priest]
Give heed, O Lord,
to my prayer,

76
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,011
the sound of my voice.

77
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,151
- You ready to go?
- I need another minute.

78
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,928
- I'm gonna stay here.
- Okay.

79
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,867
<i>People behave oddly</i>
<i>around the bereaved.</i>

80
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,002
Hey.

81
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,004
<i>They can't help themselves.</i>

82
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,541
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

83
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:46,511
You're, like,
one of the main mourners?

84
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,513
Excuse me?

85
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,450
I don't mean in a bad way.

86
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,622
So...

87
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,292
what are you doing
after this?

88
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,197
After this is the wake.

89
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,799
Right.

90
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:11,269
But after that?

91
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,247
So you think
your mother suffered?

92
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,517
My wife went through
18 months of agony.

93
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,587
To lose your mother
and your father.

94
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,756
I can't imagine
how lonely that must be.

95
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:34,593
Every day it was worse.
That's suffering.

96
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,728
Just to be by yourself.

97
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,531
It must be so painful,

98
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:43,268
so lonely.

99
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,870
<i>She was wrong, of course.</i>

100
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:48,006
<i>My parents were gone,</i>
<i>but I had my sister, Joan.</i>

101
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,677
<i>And we didn't know</i>
<i>what trouble we were in.</i>

102
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,416
So I have to ask,
Dr. King.

103
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,950
What's the story
with the clock there?

104
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,485
The clock is marked
at every 12 minutes.

105
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,220
That's how often
a woman will die

106
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,955
of breast cancer
in this country.

107
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,957
- Well, that's--
- One in nine.

108
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,293
Two million
over the next 20 years.

109
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,695
- Potentially, but--
- Maybe your wife.

110
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,664
Your daughter.

111
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,634
I think what Dr. King means

112
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:19,337
is that the disease,
along with a potential cure,

113
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,308
is of interest to a vast number
of people-- a cross section--

114
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,311
I'm sorry, Allen.
I wanna be clear
about this, Dr. King.

115
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,914
You believe
that there may be

116
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,316
a genetic link
to some breast cancers?

117
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,784
I do.

118
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,021
Even though virtually no one
else believes this to be true?

119
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,657
That's correct.

120
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:42,160
And to prove your theory,
you're going to have
to examine the--

121
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,362
- The human genome.
- The human genome, which has--

122
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:47,699
- 100,000 genes.
- Or so, give or take a few.

123
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,439
And how many women
are in your study?

124
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:58,210
- We began with
several thousand.
- Not so many.

125
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:00,846
And you'd have to
interview them all, yes?

126
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,682
Most. Yes.

127
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:10,021
100,000 genes,
several thousand women,

128
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,224
and no certain outcome?

129
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,493
Of course, we're already
well into our research.

130
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,761
Oh, well,
how far along are you?

131
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,730
Um...

132
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,804
So, 74...

133
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,941
No, no. Um...

134
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,877
six more.

135
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,845
Uh-huh.

136
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,814
So, 80...

137
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,653
Um...

138
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,326
Right. Well, thank you.

139
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,496
Thank you so much for your time
and your hospitality.

140
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,565
We'll be in touch. And we're
obviously very interested

141
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,500
in helping you with
something so important,

142
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,068
so...

143
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,579
I can't see it, Allen.
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:08,780
Can't see it?

145
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,649
We're looking at something
like 20 years here.

146
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,285
- Yeah, but Dr. King thinks--
- Dr. King thinks.

147
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,887
She thinks.
Nobody else thinks.

148
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,156
What is it about people
like Mary-Claire King

149
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,492
that think the world
owes them a living, huh?

150
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:24,362
She's like that grasshopper
with his little violin.

151
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,664
- Pardon?
- Grasshopper.

152
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,832
You know, he plays
his little violin.

153
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,535
He says, "The world
owes me a living."

154
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,572
Give him a PhD, there's your
doctor friend right there.

155
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,308
You're comparing one of
our most brilliant geneticists

156
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,244
to a cartoon grasshopper?

157
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,246
The answer's no, Allen.

158
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,115
So let's leave it alone,
huh?

159
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:47,819
Sorry.

160
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,888
He didn't like me, did he?

161
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,257
He-- No.

162
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,860
- I'm sure that--
- What did he say?

163
00:09:55,862 --> 00:10:00,031
He compared you
to an animated grasshopper.

164
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,501
Did he? Goodness.

165
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:07,005
Well, that's sort of
charming in a way.

166
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,507
- Did you tell him
about the--
- No, I--

167
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,143
- He wasn't
having any of it.
- We could--

168
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,146
Okay. I see.

169
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,850
So thank you...

170
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,553
for coming out.

171
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,059
- What will you do?
- What will I do?

172
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,861
My work.

173

<i>Yeah, yeah. I know.</i>

191
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:36,261
<i>But we were young, and we had</i>
<i>lots of time on our hands.</i>

192
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,500
That is playing with your food,
which is bad.

193
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,703
These are your sister
Joanie's tomatoes,

194
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,640
so, technically,
I'm playing with Joanie's food.

195
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:51,242
I'm playing with
Joanie's tomatoes.

196
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,845
- I think he has a point.
- I don't like tomatoes.

197
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,847
- I don't like tomatoes.
- I do have a point.

198
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,682
- I like tomatoes.
- No, you don't.

199
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,552
- You do? I didn't know that.
- Then you can have my tomatoes.

200
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,587
Paul, give Louise
my tomatoes.

201
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,355
No, I don't need
any tomatoes. I just--

202
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,724
You guys are so cute together.

203
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,426
And I hear
the thumpity thump is--

204
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,528
- Joan!
- Louise!

205
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,097
The what?
The thumpity what?

206
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,065
- I think they probably--
- I can't believe you told her.

207
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,101
- I didn't know
it was a secret.
- Nothing.

208
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,937
I told them you were good
at vegetable animals.
Really good.

209
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,706
I like to think that
my work speaks for itself.

210
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,876
- So lifelike.
- I can't believe you told her.

211
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:28,113
This is gonna go down in history
as the greatest vegetable animal

212
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,115
- ...of all time, ever.
- I didn't tell her much.

213
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,450
Of all time.
Do you see this dinosaur

214
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,152
that I've created
in this restaurant?

215
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,221
- Excuse me. Look at this.
- No.

216
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,489
It's not a real dinosaur.

217
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:38,757
It's a triceratops

218
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,258
made of fruit
and vegetables.

219
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,161
Don't be afraid.
It's gentle.

220
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,196
- See?
- We call him Larry.

221
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,932
You smell like fruit, Larry.

222
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,869
- You smell like cantaloupe.
- I'm sorry you're a prude.

223
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,640
Let's conclude.

224
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,676
We have a proposition,
a thesis of sorts,

225
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,745
that certain breast cancers
are inherited.

226
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,814
No one else believes this.
We do.

227
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,016
To prove it, we have to do
four things. Sarah?

228
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,753
First?
Find a group of women
who have breast cancer,

229
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,355
and from within that group,

230
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:12,657
women who have relatives
who have breast cancer.

231
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,392
Second?

232
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,961
We then need to find a way

233
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,763
to track the inheritance

234
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:22,834
of our breast cancer gene
from generation to generation.

235
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,736
Third?

236
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:28,339
Even if we manage
to map the gene

237
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,608
to a specific chromosome,

238
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,077
we then need to isolate
and sequence it

239
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,947
to find the mutation,
which will take years.

240
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,916
And then, uh--

241
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,485
then we find out if
it repeats in the relatives.

242
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,821
And if it does,
then that is our link.

243
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,222
Fourth?

244
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:48,026
Fourth and, realistically,
maybe the most difficult.

245
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,561
We then need to figure out

246
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:52,730
why a mutation
in a single gene

247
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,799
could lead to breast cancer
in so many women.

248
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:58,703
Wonderful.
See you first thing.

249
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,658
- Hey.
- Why are you playing
in the van?

250
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,594
The acoustics in here
are incredible.

251
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:26,130
- Slow day, then?
- Strange as it may seem,

252
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,398
no one wants
their pool service

253
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,869
this time of year.

254
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,639
And look at me.
I'm a Canadian pool man.

255
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,507
I'm like one of those

256
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,077
oxy-- oxy--

257
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,180
- Morons.
- Morons.

258
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,215
Yes.

259
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,118
I'm gonna go inside.

260
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Oh.

261
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:52,357
Okay. Well...

262
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,658
I was kind of thinking

263
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,095
maybe you should
hang out here for a bit.

264
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,164

282
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,575
- She's pregnant.
- Paul.

283
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,745
- No, I mean, you know--
- Oh, my God! Honey!

284
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,683
- Okay.
- Shit!

285
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:29,487
He's-- He's good-looking.

286
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,690

In an ugly kind of way.

287
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:36,594
He's got bass player hands.

288
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,833
I mean, I'm not saying that,
you know, babies are ugly.

289
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,735
They just got that kind of

290
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,971

do it less?

Honey, have you
and Paul been...

302
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,157
It's really bad.
We're down to, like...

303
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,895
four times a week now.

304
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,301
Are you serious?

305
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:54,338
- That's actually
quite a lot, Annie.
- It is?

306
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,174
Yeah.

307
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,144
Sorry.

308
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,813
Don't you dare!

309
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,085
No. No.

310
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,526
- Joanie, what's wrong?
- Are you okay?

311
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,463
- You all right?
- I'm sorry. It's just I--

312
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:21,032
Excuse me.

313
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,101
Joan?

314
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,171
I'm sorry.
Did I hurt you?

315
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:30,274
Oh, come on, Annie.
I make you cry, remember?

316
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:34,178
What is it?

317
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,814
Um...

318
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,317
Well, it might not be
as bad as it sounds.

319
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,352
Joan?

320
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,521
I found a lump

321
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:47,291
in my breast.

322
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,961
But you're gonna
be all right. Okay? Yeah?

323
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,562
You're gonna be just fine.

324
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:52,897
- Snap.
- Snap.

325
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,833
- I'm gonna be fine.
- Yeah. Yeah.

326
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,403
I love you.

327
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,772
I love you, honey.

328
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:05,476
- My big sister.
- That's right.

329
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,646
Four times a week.

330
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,981
Really?

331
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:13,151
Do you remember the man
in the room upstairs?

332
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,119
It wasn't a man,
it was death.

333
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,787
Shh!

334
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,257
What, you think
if we don't say it,

335
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,225
it'll go away?

336
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,595
Okay, I'll whisper.

337
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:27,098
Did you ever go in there?

338
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,106
Just once.

339
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,008
Right before...

340
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,481
No. I never did.

341
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,883
Joanie! It's not funny.

342
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,451
It's so not funny.

343
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,288
- I can't stop
thinking about it.
- Death?

344
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,722
Shh!

345
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,424
Yeah.

346
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,659
And...

347
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,527
Cancer?

348
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,896
Yeah.

349
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,966
It's stalking us.

350
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,268
Oh, you mean like that guy
you met at the Leafs game

351
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,139
who kept calling you
and sending you chocolate
hearts,

352
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,875
and then he parked
outside our house,

353
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,877
and Dad caught him

354
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,780
jerking off
into<i> Hockey News?</i>

355
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,719
Yeah.

356
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,788
Like him.

357
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,090
Because I'm scared.

358
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:30,027
I'm really, really scared
that it's inside of us,

359
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:33,397
it's in our family.

360
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,800
Sweetie...

361
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:38,169
that's not true.

362
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,244
[Annie]
I'm sorry.

363
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,312
I'm sorry.

364
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,181
[Joan]
Don't be.

365
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,483
I like it when
you're worried.

366
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:58,789
I like it when you have
lots of problems.

367
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,282
It's gonna be really hard
without Joanie.

368
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,686
I know.

369
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:31,122
- I know.
- Come here.

370
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,292
Come here. Come here.

371
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:37,361
Well, at least
she went quick.

372
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:39,363
Not like my wife.

373
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,432
Boy, she took her time,
didn't she?

374
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:44,201
I mean, it was
endless suffering.

375
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:46,237
Endless.

376
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,076
My God.

377
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:54,879
First your mother,

378
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,748
then your father.

379
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,285
Now... poor Joan.

380
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:17,601
You again? Cool.

381
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,570
You know, a lot of women

382
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,138
can't be hot

383
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,274
and in mourning
at the same time,

384
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:26,344
but you-- you pull it off.

385
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,249
I don't mean
any disrespect,

386
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:35,152
but when you
think about it,

387
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:38,723
isn't sex our way of saying

388
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:41,525
"fuck you" to death?

389
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,665
How are you still
working here?

390
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:59,577
<i>The thing was, I started</i>
<i>thinking about it all the</i>
<i>time--</i>

391
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,812
<i>my family and death.</i>

392
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:04,215
<i>Watching me, waiting,</i>

393
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:07,551
<i>hiding in a closet</i>
<i>or parked outside the house,</i>

394
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,354
<i>the</i> Hockey News.

395
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:13,023
Oh, you might feel
some discomfort.

396
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,361
Beautiful day today.

397
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:18,629
Though I'm stuck in here,

398
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:21,031
it looked lovely
through the window.

399
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,734
And I spoke to your husband.

400
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,237
He explained
you were very worried.

401
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,541
He said I was
feeling myself up, right?

402
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:31,976
Checking, yes.

403
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,412
Perfectly understandable
once in a while.

404
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,215
He said once in a while?

405
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,559
Yeah.

406
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:25,696
Oh, yeah. Keep talking.
Oh, keep talking.

407
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:34,238
You know, there is
a simple check you can do
for testicular cancer.

408
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,373
I heard about this.

409
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,175
Baby, do you want me
to check you now

410
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,711
while I'm down there?

411
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,480
- Come on.
- Annie. Annie.

412
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,049
What? Oh, what?

413
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:48,219
He mentioned that perhaps

414
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:51,655
you were overly concerned.

415
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:55,826
I know your family history.
It's very sad.

416
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,261
But that doesn't mean

417
00:24:57,263 --> 00:25:00,064
that you're going
to get cancer.

418
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:03,801
Look, Anne.
White coat, stethoscope.

419
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:05,603
You can trust me.

420
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,638
No more worrying, okay?

421
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,106
- Okay.
- Good.

422
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,675
That's my girl.

423
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,151
I don't know about genetics.
I know about computers.

424
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:22,820
You see,
I make these cards,

425
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,588
and then I load them
into the front of the computer,

426
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,190
along with everyone else's,
and then,

427
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,725
usually the next day
sometime,

428
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:30,227
depending on how many other
people are using the computer,

429
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:32,663
maybe a few days later,

430
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:35,432
I get this printout.
And there you go.

431
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:38,035
And for the amount of data
we're going to have, how fast?

432
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,838
The university's mainframe
computer weighs
two and a half tons.

433
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,841
It's capable of storing
700 kilobytes of data.

434
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:46,911
I'm sorry. How long?

435
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:49,046
Once we get the data,
make a program

436
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:52,650
and then load it...

437
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:55,419
Ten years?

438
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,192
Will?

439
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,562
- Yeah?
- Honey.

440
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:07,131
Come on. Get up.

441
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,599
I'm up.

442
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,000
No, no, no.

443
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:13,037
If you're not out of bed,
you're not up.

444
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,973
Hey.

445
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:19,810
- You're not gonna
have breakfast?
- Uh, I can't.

446
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,513
Work. Got a new client.

447
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,450
They called this morning.

448
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:29,853
- Kiss?
- I'm already late, Annie.

449
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,358
What?

450
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,162
Hey, I'm a musician, okay?
It's a look.

451
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,632
Okay.

452
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,938
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be

453
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,674
a pool man, like Dad.

454
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:53,010
Do you, sweetie?

455
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:55,145
Oh, that's so nice.

456
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,413
Well, maybe when
you're a little older,

457
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,916
we'll talk about it,
okay?

458
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,821
Mommy's gonna
go take a shower.

459
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:46,830
Mommy loves you, okay?
Have a great day.

460
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,015
All right.

461
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,884
Anne...

462
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,288
your biopsy shows

463
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,824
that you have carcinoma
of the left breast.

464
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,694
Phew.

465
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:18,762
And I thought it was
gonna be really bad news.

466
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:22,199
Well, it's quite advanced,
I'm afraid.

467
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,069
But what I recommend

468
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,303
would be surgery.

469
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,205
- Surgery?
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,007
What's known as a modified

471
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:33,177
radical mastectomy.

472
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,445
Oh, God.

473
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:36,547
I'm sorry, Anne.

474
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,949
The surgery would require,

475
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:42,219
I'm afraid, the removal
of the entire breast,

476
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,987
as well as most of your

477
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:46,990
underarm lymph nodes.

478
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,226
Oh, God.

479
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,528
Oh, God. William.

480
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,265
I'm scared.

481
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:58,235
I don't wanna be scared.

482
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,703
I don't want to suffer.

483
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:02,039
- I know. I know.
- I don't want to suffer.

484
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:05,309
I don't want to die.

485
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:08,746
Oh, God.

486
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,682
Oh, God.

487
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:13,684
Oh, God.

488
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,606
Hey.

489
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,775
Hey.

490
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,716
How you doing?

491
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:50,621
Hey, you want an ice chip?

492
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,965
Oh.

493
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,406
Can I have one?

494
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,377
This is really good ice.

495
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:17,347
Oh, my God.

496
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:18,916
Oh, my God. Wow.

497
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:22,219
It's really good.

498
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:25,222
Ow. It hurts.
Don't make me laugh.

499
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:28,525
What? Oh, don't-- Oh.

500
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:39,002
It really hurts.

501
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:23,347
- And how are we feeling today?
- Not too good.

502
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:26,683
- Oh?
- I had a breast removed.

503
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,420
Of course.
What I meant--

504
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,356
I'm feeling all right,
considering.

505
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:35,192
Good.

506
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:38,829
But, you know, I just knew
this was gonna happen.

507
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:41,598
It happened to my mom,
happened to my sister,

508
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,200
and it happened
to my grandma--

509
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:47,170
Many women feel that way and,
yes, your family did have

510
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:49,840
a bit of bad luck, but there
are many complex factors--

511
00:31:49,842 --> 00:31:51,909
- It's not bad luck.
- There's some evidence

512
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:55,512
that certain people
have a predisposition

513
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:58,615
based on diet
or environmental factors--

514
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,718
Excuse me a minute.

515
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,021
What are you doing?

516
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:06,556
Well, there's just some
interesting current research
that suggests--

517
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,692
Look, rejection
of orthodoxy

518
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:11,161
always seems within the purview
of the young doctor.

519
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:12,629
I don't know what my age
has to do with that.

520
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,899
However, to mislead
is irresponsible.

521
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,735
There have always been articles.
There always will be articles.

522
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,305
But because some theory is new
doesn't make it right.

523
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:24,908
Proof makes it right.
And I've seen no recent evidence

524
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,944
concerning alternative
treatment for cancer

525
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:29,613
which would lead me to alter
the views I've acquired

526
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,816
over 40 years
of practicing medicine.

527
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,253
- I understand.
- Good.

528
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,091
Good.

529
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,298
Hey, if you wanna
talk some more,

530
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,633
you can just
give me a call.

531
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:53,537
- Oh, thanks a lot, Dr.--
- Doctor!

532
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,872
Sean is fine.

533
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:58,208
- Anne, right?
- Annie.

534
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,243
Annie.

535
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,846
Thanks.

536
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:05,649
Let me tell you,
I'm gonna be the best nurse

537
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,217
you have ever had.

538
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:08,785
And I think I already am,

539
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:11,922
because you can't make out
with your other nurses.

540
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:15,218
Mommy was in the hospital
because Mommy has cancer.

541
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:20,991
- Didn't Aunt Joan have cancer?
- Yeah, she did, sweetie.

542
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:23,627
But she died.

543
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:25,695
Yeah, she did.

544
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:29,466
- Are you gonna die?
- Hey, no.

545
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:31,401
I promise you.

546
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:35,305
You are not gonna lose
your mommy to cancer.

547
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,707
But how do you know?

548
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,876
Because I just know.

549
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,212
I'm not gonna die.

550
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,480
Wait.

551
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:19,049
I wanna come with you.

552
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:23,987
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're going to work.

553
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,556
That's not anywhere.

554
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:29,326
Aren't you cleaning Louise
and Steve's pool today?

555
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:31,361
I wanna come with you.

556
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:34,297
Come on. It'll be fun.

557
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,333
Please?

558
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,105
Come on, then.

559
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,246
- Let's get in.
- Yeah, right.

560
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:50,514
I'm serious.

561
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,482
Uh, we're not getting in.

562
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,984
Why not?

563
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:56,419
Because I don't want to,

564
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,155
and because I'm a pool man,

565
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:01,258
and pool men don't get
into people's pools.

566
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,728
Is that, like, the pool man's
code of ethics or something?

567
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,134
Why is the water green?

568
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,970
Because Louise's
dumbfuck husband

569
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,206
only has me come
once a month.

570
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:19,609
No. No, I mean, really,
why is it green?

571
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,279
Oh, that's algae.

572
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:24,314
It's there because the pH
balance of the pool is off.

573
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:26,516
It can't be
too acid or too base.

574
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,818
It needs to be around 7.5,

575
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,923
the same pH as human tears.

576
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:34,558
Aw.

577
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,626
See, if you, uh--

578
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:40,597
If you don't put chlorine in,
you get phosphates,

579
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,099
and algae feeds on phosphate.

580
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,769
But if you put chlorine in,

581
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,504
the algae will die.

582
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,539
But you can't be a dumbfuck

583
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,742
and only have your pool man
come once a month.

584
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,747
Are you gonna
keep wearing eye makeup?

585
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,116
Yeah, I am.

586
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,854
I'm gonna get
something to drink.

587
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,324
- You want something?
- Nah.

588
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:09,492
I'll stay here.

589
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,897
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>if the pool was green</i>

590
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,532
<i>because Paul was</i>
<i>a bad pool man</i>

591
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:18,034
<i>or because Louise's husband</i>
<i>was a dumbfuck.</i>

592
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:20,136

593
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:29,446
"Breast cancer.

594
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:30,847
Okay.

595
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,850
"Cancer.
Any malignant growth or tumor

596

598

William?

599
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,564
Willy, Mommy needs
the bathroom.

Number one or number two?

601
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52,002
Number one or number two?

[Annie retches]

603
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,494
Mommy's gonna buy you
a new backpack.

604
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:20,397
Okay?

605
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:26,036
Hi. Sorry. I'm, uh--

606
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:29,306
- Where are you off to?
- Detroit.

607
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,241
Gotta run.
Hope you're well.

608
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:35,278
I am fine.
What about our coffee?

609
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,247
You're late.

610
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,584
- What's going on?
- Allen, you got here too late.

611
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,387
- You're late.
- I know, I know.
I'm late, I'm late.

612
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:45,922
We have news.

613
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:47,891
We've identified a dozen
high-risk families--

614
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,793
50-some cancer cases
between them.

615
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:51,695
- Good. And so?
- So?

616
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:54,431
So now we can begin to look
for correlations in earnest.

617
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,933
We need to interview them,
get blood samples,

618
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,035
extract the DNA, and then
begin to look for markers.

619
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,438
- Okay. "Markers"?
- Genetic markers.

620
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,740
We can track them
through the families,

621
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:05,608
like a signpost
on a highway.

622
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,410
Say you have
two stretches of road
in the desert--

623
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,112
And they look
exactly the same.

624
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,381
But if you pass signposts,
you can measure the intervals--

625
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:13,049
And you can identify
the different stretches of road.

626
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,185
Even if they look--
And if those markers

627
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,087
are next to something
like the breast cancer gene,

628
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:19,956
it can be identified.

629
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,243
What is it with
the magazine selection

630
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:43,546
in doctors' offices?

631
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,815
Hello.

632
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:49,319
<i>Field & Stream?</i>

633
00:39:49,321 --> 00:39:50,754
Do a lot of your patients

634
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:54,457
show up wearing
camouflage bibs,

635
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:58,595
a bag full of decoys,
and making duck calls?

636
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:01,264
I don't know, ma'am.

637
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:05,135
I would think that you would
notice something like that.

638
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:08,071
Like I said, I don't know.

639
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,977
Quack.

640
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,749
Quack.

641
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,452
Quack.

642
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:23,887
Quack quack.

643
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:25,655
Quack.

644
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:27,724
Quack.

645
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,695
[Annie]
Nice office.

646
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,799
It's not mine.
Dr. Benton takes long lunches.

647
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:37,333
I figure it's not
hurting anybody.

648
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,836
It was either here
or the cafeteria,

649
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,272
and the floors are
much stickier there.

650
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,274
Are you sure you won't
get into any trouble?

651
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,176
I'm a doctor.
I can't get in trouble.

652
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,049
What can I tell you?
I'm mostly lab-based,

653
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,018
but I can tell you

654
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,921
what I know.

655
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:00,056
Why do I have cancer?

656
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,260
That's a big question.

657
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:08,064
There's no one answer.
So many factors involved.

658
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,667
I had a feeling
that you might say that.

659
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,104
You know, I had a teacher
once who told me

660
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,440
what the ideal breast cancer
patient would be.

661
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:19,142
He said the person
with the highest risk

662
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,845
would be a nun
living in a cold climate,

663
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:25,215
who was overweight,
who ate red meat,
who was breast fed,

664
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:27,851
whose mother and sister
had premenopausal breast cancer,

665
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:30,520
and who was
Ashkenazi Jewish.

666
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,727
<i>Not a great start,</i>

667
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,295
<i>but he gave me</i>
<i>a pile of books,</i>

668
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:42,098
<i>and I promised</i>
<i>to read them.</i>

669
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,948
Doesn't make any sense.

<i>[quiet TV]</i>

671
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:12,562

00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:14,264
Good, good! Ohh!

You know, it's been hard

675
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:22,539
It's not like he gets

676
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:25,275
any attention.

677
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:27,343
You're right, you know?
I'm being selfish.

678
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:31,180
No. That's not
what I meant.

679
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:33,216
You're right.

680
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,486
Maybe I am.

681
00:42:36,488 --> 00:42:39,188
You know,
I feel sorry for Paul.

682
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,225
I do, and I...

683
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:45,094
I feel sorry
for me, too, but...

684
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,300
You know what I feel
most of all?

685
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,537
What?

686
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,609
I just wanna be touched.

687
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,980
Come here.

688
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:06,115
Come on.

689
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:11,220
Come here. Come here.

690
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,367
Okay.

691
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,803
So this is something
we need to look at.

692
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,308
Don't mind me.

693
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:36,646
So does that mean
I have to eat

694
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,247
nothing but grapefruit
or something?

695
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:39,916
No, no.
It's nothing that severe.

696
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:41,985
Although studies
have shown that

697
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:43,486
foods high in fat,
fried foods--

698
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:47,390
- Japanese women.
- Pardon me?

699
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:50,393
They eat very little red meat,
and they have a much lower rate

700
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:52,261
of breast cancer
than North American women.

701
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:55,765
Is that so?

702
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:59,535
Yeah.

703
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:01,671
- So did your family go out--
- Three different tests.

704
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:05,842
One was over ten years.
It's fairly conclusive.

705
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,714
Anyway,
I'm gonna get going.

706
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:20,189
- So--
- We can't know anything.

707
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:22,225
There's so many
possible factors.

708
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:25,628
It could be diet.
It could be toxins in the home.

709
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,365
One of a thousand viruses
known or unknown.

710
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,701
They know the groups that
have the highest incidents.

711
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:34,871
They don't know the elements
common to those groups.

712
00:44:34,873 --> 00:44:36,806
We don't know
what happened to your family.

713
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:40,510
We may never know.

714
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:43,413
My mom used to wrap
hot dogs in bacon,

715
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:45,782
and they deep-fried them.

716
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:53,022
- What's this?
- It's dinner.

717
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,625
Where's the rest of it?

718
00:44:55,627 --> 00:44:58,928
That's it.
It's a salad.

719
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:05,368
It's got tomatoes in it.
I hate tomatoes.

720
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,371
You can pick them out.

721
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,710
Is everything okay?

722
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,980
Yeah. Yeah.

723
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,121
You know what?
Um, I'm gonna go

724
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:27,590
get us some burgers.

725
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,427
- You want one?
- Yeah!

726
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,896
But no tomatoes
and no oniony things.

727
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,265
No tomatoes
and no oniony things.

728
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:39,435
Okay. You want one?

729
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,880
Why are we looking
at Mormons and Jews?

730
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:53,316
Mormons tend to have
very large families,

731
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:55,752
which makes them
excellent genetic resources.

732
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:57,520
Plus the Church
of Latter Day Saints

733
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,255
believes everyone
related to the Mormons

734
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:02,225
has to be baptized
to be saved later.

735
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:03,593
So, what,
there's carcinogens

736
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,361
in the baptismal water
they're using?

737
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:07,396
No. But they keep

738
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:09,966
incredibly detailed records
of their familial ties.

739
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:12,201
A researcher
before us found

740
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:15,471
30 cases of breast cancer
in one family.

741
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,039
Called the Kindred 107.

742
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,075
Ashkenazi Jews are
important, Tom, because

743
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:21,744
they have an extraordinarily
high rate of breast cancer.

744
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:23,746
In New York,
it's an epidemic.

745
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:25,515
Okay. But...

746
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:27,416
why couldn't it be
the water or the air?

747
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,986
If that was true, it would be
true of all women in the area.

748
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:32,288
Breathing the same air,
drinking the same water.

749
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,490
- But it's not.
- So it's something in them.

750
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:37,493
In their genes.

751
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:55,411
You're early.
Dr. Gold's not here.

752
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:57,947
So how did you know
all that stuff the other day?

753
00:46:57,949 --> 00:46:59,382
What stuff?

754
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:01,984
The medical stuff.

755
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:05,621
I used to be a nurse.

756
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:09,091
- You used to be a nurse?
- Yep.

757
00:47:09,093 --> 00:47:11,527
- What happened?
- What do you mean,
"what happened"?

758
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:14,864
You don't think
I enjoy this? Yes?

759
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:16,065
Okay.

760
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:17,900
Mr. Elson, you can
take your wife through

761
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:21,270
to the back
with the nurse.

762
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:25,141
Seriously, what happened?

763
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:27,877
Uh...

764
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:31,480
I used to work
in the oncology ward.

765
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:33,816
But it was too much,

766
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:36,586
so I quit.

767
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:40,122
You're right. Cancer patients
are a pain in the ass.

768
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,327
- Sorry.
- Hello.

769
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:47,597
Yes, Doctor, the tests
will be ready this afternoon.

770
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,832
No, Doctor.
I would've told you.

771
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:51,801
Okay. Bye-bye.

772
00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:55,404
- You're right.
- About what?

773
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:58,241
You're all
a pain in the ass.

774
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:01,310
That's true.

775
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:04,013
- He likes you, you know.
- Who?

776
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:06,148
Dr. Gold?

777
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,017
Yeah, him.

778
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:11,220
- No.
- Yes, he does.

779
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,889
I'm married.

780
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:16,092
Of course.
What was I thinking?

781
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:17,326
[Dr. Gold]
Annie.

782
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:20,763
Hey. Hi.

783
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:23,132
Oh. Oh.

784
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,260
I could've gotten cancer

785
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,262
from my mom?
Like passed down?

786
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,064
Uh, there's no evidence

787
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:56,999
that you can
get it passed down.

788
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:58,868
All cancer is
genetic in the end,

789
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,070
just not necessarily
in the beginning.

790
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:02,571
I don't understand.

791
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:06,409
When you get cancer,
your DNA gets messed up,

792
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:08,511
and certain genes

793
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:11,614
can cause your cells
to replicate wildly.

794
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:14,350
But something
has to mess the DNA up

795
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:16,752
in the first place,
right?
Right.

796
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:20,589
Well, then,
what messes it up?

797
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:23,826
We don't know, really.

798
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:29,632
I really didn't mean
to upset you again.

799
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,568
It's not you. It's me.

800
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,537
It's the chemo, I think.

801
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:37,406
You know, I even cried

802
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:39,809
at the Leafs game
with Paul last night.

803
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,811
- You did?
- Yeah.

804
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:45,982
It was a tie,
but the players
all looked so sad.

805
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:58,060
Hey, An--

806
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:06,235
Hey, hon.

807
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:09,805
Hon.

808
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:15,044
Annie...

809
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:16,912
Why?

810
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:20,549
Why? We've got doctors.

811
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,685
The chemo...

812
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:26,322
is going well...

813
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:28,090
you know?

814
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,563
I've gotta
do something. I...

815
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:37,600
Annie...

816
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:40,870
Hey, why can't you
just leave it alone?

817
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,777
<i>I really didn't know.</i>

818
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:49,345
<i>I think that part</i>
<i>more than anything</i>

819
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,480
<i>drove him crazy.</i>

820
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:53,749
<i>Guys want reasons.</i>

821
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:56,018
<i>I should've made one up.</i>

822
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,427
I don't know, Annie.
Maybe you need to give him time.

823
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,797
I've given him time.

824
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:44,500
Maybe it has something to do
with the...

825
00:51:44,502 --> 00:51:46,735
- You know. The--
- What?

826
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:47,970
I don't know.
All the research.

827
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:51,841
It's a tiny,
tiny bit obsessive.

828
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:55,211
Obsessive? How?

829
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:58,047
You know, like...

830
00:51:58,049 --> 00:51:59,815
wacko obsessive.

831
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:05,621
Wacko obsessive.

832
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,790
It's not the bad kind, then.

833
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,628
It's not too late
to reach out to him

834
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,065
and to let him know
how you feel.

835
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,270
What, like a blow job?

836
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:27,176
Yeah, that's
exactly what I mean.

837
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:29,678
[Kim]
Have you guys heard
of Mary-Claire King?

838
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,881
She used dental genetics

839
00:52:31,883 --> 00:52:33,782
to identify children

840
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:36,285
of parents murdered
by the junta in Argentina.

841
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:39,221
But she is also doing
some very interesting work

842
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:42,691
on the genetics
of breast cancer.

843
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,028
<i>So I wrote to Dr. King,</i>

844
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,030
<i>and I wrote to her again,</i>

845
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:50,833
<i>and I wrote a third</i>
<i>and a fourth time.</i>

846
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,902
<i>I told her my story,</i>

847
00:52:52,904 --> 00:52:55,037
<i>my family's story.</i>

848
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,219
<i>Books were hard for me,</i>

849
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:13,556
<i>so I started making models</i>
<i>so I could understand.</i>

850
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:15,624
<i>Cells, genes,</i>

851
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:18,727
<i>chromosomes, and a helix.</i>

852
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,767
I'm going to the bar!

853
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,604
What?

854
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:30,306
I'm going to the effing bar

855
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:33,209
because this is
an effing building site!

856
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:37,846
I can't hear you!

857
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:40,883
I don't fucking
believe this.

858
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:43,852
I'm going out!

859
00:53:43,854 --> 00:53:47,556
Hey, watch the rest of the game.
Remember the score.

860
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:51,260
Paul, would you
put William to bed?

861
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:22,124
<i>We didn't discover much</i>
<i>in that first year,</i>

862
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:25,361
<i>but, oddly, that mattered</i>
<i>less and less.</i>

863
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:31,033
<i>Something mysterious</i>
<i>was taking hold of me.</i>

864
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:33,135
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>what it was then.</i>

865
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:35,337
<i>That would come later.</i>

866
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,011
<i>And then, some news.</i>

867
00:54:42,013 --> 00:54:44,847
Keep having you
in to do screenings

868
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:46,248
every six months or so

869
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,983
just as a precautionary
measure,

870
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:50,085
but I would say that

871
00:54:50,087 --> 00:54:52,354
cancer is out of your life.

872
00:54:52,356 --> 00:54:56,158
You have reason
to celebrate.

873
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,560
Done?

874
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:00,729
I'm done with chemo?

875
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:04,033
You're done with chemo.

876
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:46,909
Hey.

877
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:50,079
Hey. What is this?

878
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:53,549
Uh, Louise is
watching William.

879
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:58,120
Okay. Um, I...

880
00:55:58,122 --> 00:56:00,389
I wish you had told me.

881
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:04,093
- Why?
- 'Cause I have plans.

882
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,161
- You have plans?
- Yeah.

883
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,497
- What plans?
- Just...

884
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:11,066
You know, just plans.

885
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:16,138
I...

886
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:22,611
Can you just stay
and eat a little bit

887
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:24,780
before you go at least?

888
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:27,182
Yeah. Yeah.

889
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,786
Great.

890
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:33,222
Okay.

891
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,695
Can you change them?

892
00:56:39,697 --> 00:56:43,665
- What?
- Your plans.

893
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:46,101
I kind of, uh...

894
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:48,771
I made this dinner
special for us, you know?

895
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:51,473
Thank you.
I know you went to...

896
00:56:51,475 --> 00:56:53,208
a lot of trouble,
and it looks great.

897
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,543
- I just--
- No, no.

898
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:58,380
There's no trouble,
Paul, you know?

899
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,583
I'm married.

900
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:05,721
Married people do nice things
for each other.

901
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:07,656
I know.

902
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:11,093
They do things together...

903
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,695
like make love.

904
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,500
Annie, please, just--

905
00:57:18,502 --> 00:57:20,769
We can have sex.

906
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,771
Don't do this.

907
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:26,074
Don't you love me anymore?

908
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:27,643
Annie, I do.

909
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:29,545
Hey, I want to.

910
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:30,779
You want to?

911
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,247
No, I-- I do.

912
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:33,715
Well, then,
I don't understand

913
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:36,385
what the problem is.

914
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:39,254
Why can't you make love
to me anymore?

915
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:41,156
Look, I just-- I just--
I just can't.

916
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:43,525
- You can't?
- Okay? I can't.

917
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:51,800
Oh, is it because
I only have one breast?

918
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,969
- Is that what it is?
- Oh, my God, Annie.

919
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,605
Why don't you just, like,
only put it up halfway?

920
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:58,607
Maybe you could
get half-erect.

921
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:01,276
- Maybe you could close one eye.
- Annie, stop it!

922
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:02,878
- No, I will not stop it!
- Stop it! Stop!

923
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,714
I can't touch you!

924
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:09,284
Okay? I can't touch you!

925
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:11,720
Annie...

926
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:15,224
I can't even look at you,
at your body.

927
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:17,759
I mean, I hate that--

928
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:21,096
that hole, that scar.

929
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:26,268
I'm sorry. I just...

930
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:39,414
Paul...

931
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:29,197
[Kim]
Knudson's
two-hit theory?

932
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,567
Normal cells have
two undamaged chromosomes--

933
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:33,368
- ...one from the mom--
- And one from the dad.

934
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,304
<i>Right. Now, let's say</i>
<i>there is some sort of</i>

935
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:37,072
<i>hereditary</i>
<i>predisposition to cancer.</i>

936
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:40,375
<i>All that means is that</i>
<i>one of the genes is damaged.</i>

937
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,780
<i>[Annie]</i>
<i>I still haven't heard</i>
<i>from Dr. King.</i>

938
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:46,181
<i>[Dr. Gold]</i>
<i>I don't think you're</i>
<i>the only person</i>

939
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:48,150
<i>to write to her, Annie.</i>

940
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:50,218
<i>[Kim]</i>
<i>In the last five years,</i>
<i>the Broad Institute,</i>

941
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,787
<i>the Genome Institute</i>
<i>at Washington University,</i>

942
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:54,723
<i>and the Baylor College of</i>
<i>Medicine...</i>

943
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,568
<i>[Annie]</i>
<i>And I would go through life</i>
<i>with this one bad gene,</i>

944
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,236
<i>and everything's</i>
<i>still okay,</i>

945
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:10,138
<i>because the other gene</i>
<i>is fine, right?</i>

946
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,307
<i>[Dr. Gold]</i>
<i>And then one of these factors</i>
<i>comes along, like those--</i>

947
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:15,777
<i>All that would mean is that</i>
<i>they would have to damage</i>
<i>the other gene?</i>

948
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,680
<i>Right. And then</i>
<i>the cell is damaged enough</i>
<i>that it can mutate.</i>

949
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:22,317
<i>Which could be cancer.</i>
<i>Could be. Can be.</i>

950
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,586
<i>It's, uh...</i>

951
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:41,336
It's all too much.

952
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:09,297
Is this a doctorly hug?

953
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:16,438
I should leave.

954
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,909
<i>He was a lovely man</i>
<i>and a friend.</i>

955
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:21,977
See you later.

956
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:23,979
<i>But love is like DNA.</i>

957
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:27,949
<i>We can't know</i>
<i>its predispositions.</i>

958
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:29,885
<i>It wasn't to be.</i>

959
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:32,254
<i>For me, anyway.</i>

960
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:55,210
- Where's Dad?
- I don't know, sweetie.

961
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,412
Maybe he went to work early.

962
01:01:57,414 --> 01:02:01,349
- Where's Dad?
- Come on. Eat your oatmeal.

963
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,100
Not this. Please. Come on.

964
01:02:18,102 --> 01:02:20,435
I'm not gonna eat till
you tell me where Dad is.

965
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:23,305
- Eat your oatmeal.
- Where's Dad?

966
01:02:23,307 --> 01:02:26,174
- Eat your oatmeal.
- I don't want to.

967
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:29,311
I said eat your
goddamn oatmeal now!

968
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:35,550
Oh, God. William!

969
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:37,486
Honey, I'm sorry.

970
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:44,059
[William grunts]

971
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:48,497
William!

972
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,770
William, no.
These are Mommy's things.

973
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:57,672
William, no. Please don't.

974
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:04,913
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

975
01:03:04,915 --> 01:03:06,948
Come here. Come here.

976
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,118
Sweetie, come on. Come on.

977
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,187
Come on.

978
01:03:12,189 --> 01:03:15,357
Hey, come on. I'm sorry.

979
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:18,059
Hey, sweetie, come on.
Come here.

980
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:24,699
God, I'm sorry.

981
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:27,569
I will never, ever
talk to you like that again.

982
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:29,638
- Okay? I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry.

983
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,706
Hey, you don't
need to be sorry.

984
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:34,109
They're Mommy's
silly things.

985
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:46,154
Louise? Louise!

986
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,590
Sweetie?

987
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,894
Louise?

988
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:54,496
[moaning]

989
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,435
Stop!

990
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:05,674
Oh shit.

991
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,764
- Divorced?
- Yes, sweetie.

992
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:04,766
Mommy and Daddy are gonna
live in different houses,

993
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:07,035
but that doesn't mean we don't
love you very, very much.

994
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:09,271
This way,
you'll have two houses.

995
01:05:09,273 --> 01:05:12,807
I don't want two houses.
I want us all together
in one house.

996
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:16,111
- So does Dad.
- Please, Paul, don't do that.

997
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:18,013
What? I'm telling the truth.

998
01:05:18,015 --> 01:05:20,982
- I knew this was your fault.
- No, it's not my fault, honey.

999
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:23,051
Paul?
Maybe if you didn't

1000
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:25,820
spend all your time
on this DNA shit.

1001
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:27,889
At least there's
a reason for that.

1002
01:05:27,891 --> 01:05:31,159
Reason? Really? What reason?
Tell me the reason.

1003
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:33,762
- Because I have to know.
- Are you fucking joking?

1004
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:36,765
- Language.
- You have a high school
education, Annie.

1005
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,334
You don't know anything.
You're not gonna find out
anything.

1006
01:05:39,336 --> 01:05:41,736
- Is that why
you won't touch me?
- Oh, here we go.

1007
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:43,939
Oh, so you can say--
you can say that.

1008
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:47,342
but I fucking
can't say "fucking"?

1009
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:49,311
Do you wanna tell him
the real truth?

1010
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:52,948
- Tell him about Louise?
- Oh, my God.

1011
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:56,251
- What about Aunt Louise?
- Nothing, William.

1012
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:58,620
It's nothing.

1013
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:04,326
Tell you what, Annie.

1014
01:06:04,328 --> 01:06:06,094
I am sorry.

1015
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:08,663
I tried. I tried.

1016
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:12,233
- I just couldn't.
- Get out.

1017
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:13,902
- What?
- Get out.

1018
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:23,345
I'll tell you what, Annie.

1019
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:26,548
At least
she was there for me.

1020
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:43,098
I'm so sorry.

1021
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,467
What's going on?

1022
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:48,069
- Come on.
- Just listen.

1023
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:51,072
These four women
have breast cancer.

1024
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:53,708
What they've found
are certain,

1025
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:55,643
let's call them
odd proteins,

1026
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:58,546
that have unique configurations
in the parent gene.

1027
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:00,682
Let's say these are them.

1028
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:03,485
We can identify them
by their unique,

1029
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:06,254
say, shape.

1030
01:07:06,256 --> 01:07:10,225
Now, each parent donates
a gene to the child,

1031
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:12,727
and the genes get
all mixed up, right?

1032
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:16,664
But look. It's not
completely arbitrary.

1033
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:18,666
- We have news.
- Genetic markers.

1034
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:22,203
- We can track them
through their families.
- And what we can call linkage.

1035
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:26,541
Do you see it?

1036
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:29,310
We now know that even though

1037
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:32,847
our genes get all mixed up
when we're conceived,

1038
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:34,682
certain markers remain.

1039
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:36,751
- Markers?
- Genetic markers.

1040
01:07:36,753 --> 01:07:39,621
We can track them
through the families.

1041
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:42,223
It's like a signpost
on a highway.

1042
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:44,292
Say you have two stretches
of road in the desert.

1043
01:07:44,294 --> 01:07:46,094
- And they look
exactly the same.
- Right.

1044
01:07:46,096 --> 01:07:49,230
But if you pass signposts,
you can measure the intervals.

1045
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,932
And you can identify
the different stretches of road.

1046
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:52,801
Even if they look
exactly the same.

1047
01:07:52,803 --> 01:07:54,436
And if those markers
are next to something,

1048
01:07:54,438 --> 01:07:55,570
like the breast
cancer gene,

1049
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:56,905
it can be identified.

1050
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:58,873
We now know that even though

1051
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:02,277
our genes get all mixed up
when we're conceived,

1052
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:05,680
certain markers remain.

we removed everything
that we found.

1228
01:20:37,767 --> 01:20:40,568
Anything left
is potentially curable

1229
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,970
with chemotherapy.

1230
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:48,242
Advanced?

1231
01:20:48,244 --> 01:20:50,611
Stage three.

1232
01:20:50,613 --> 01:20:53,314
You have a long,
hard fight ahead of you.

1233
01:20:53,316 --> 01:20:54,715
I'm 37.

1234
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:58,319
Oh, that's very young.

1235
01:20:58,321 --> 01:21:00,120
You rest,
and we'll talk later,

1236
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:02,423
all right?

1237
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:14,802
All right. I've reviewed
your pathology reports,

1238
01:21:14,804 --> 01:21:18,072
and it's good
you had the surgery.

1239
01:21:18,074 --> 01:21:19,340
Please, Doctor.

1240
01:21:19,342 --> 01:21:22,109
You know
I prefer bad news.

1241
01:21:22,111 --> 01:21:23,911
Cheers me up.

1242
01:21:23,913 --> 01:21:27,548
With what we're seeing
on your path reports,

1243
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:29,316
I have to tell you,

1244
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:31,819
this type of cancer

1245
01:21:31,821 --> 01:21:33,721
responds best

1246
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:36,824
to a combination
of chemotherapy drugs.

1247
01:21:36,826 --> 01:21:39,460
We'd like you
to receive cisplatin

1248
01:21:39,462 --> 01:21:42,229
and cyclophosphamide.

1249
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:45,966
Maybe ten or twelve
treatments.

1250
01:21:45,968 --> 01:21:47,501
How long?

1251
01:21:47,503 --> 01:21:50,838
Altogether,
a year or so.

1252
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,479
I've been here before.

1253
01:21:58,481 --> 01:22:00,481
I know you have.

1254
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:05,219
So what do you say?

1255
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:24,038
Damn, you're hot.

1256
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:43,557
I need some water.

1257
01:22:43,559 --> 01:22:45,893
One breast,

1258
01:22:45,895 --> 01:22:47,761
no hair.

1259
01:22:47,763 --> 01:22:51,131
They all want you,
but they can't have you.

1260
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:59,206
Just hold on a minute.

1261
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:01,241
Sorry.

1262
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,686
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.

1263
01:23:12,688 --> 01:23:15,923
I'm gonna be sick.

1264
01:23:15,925 --> 01:23:17,624
Oh!

1265
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:25,599
You are so hot, baby.

1266
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:29,169
One breast, no hair.

1267
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:31,305
What's weird is that
you want your mom.

1268
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:33,407
I just want my mommy.

1269
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:35,776
I just want my mommy.

1270
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:40,481
- You need the nurse?
- I'm in too much pain.

1271
01:23:40,483 --> 01:23:44,485
- You need the nurse?
- I want-- I'm in too much pain.

1272
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:47,554
Okay. Are you comfortable?

1273
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:50,791
No. I'm hot. Let me take...

1274
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:54,128
I'll take 'em off.

1275
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,797
They all want you,

1276
01:23:56,799 --> 01:23:59,333
but they can't have you.

1277
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:21,221
- It hurts me.
- I know, sweetie.

1278
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:25,993
It really hurts.

1279
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:30,464
No.

1280
01:24:30,466 --> 01:24:32,866
No, they can't.

1281
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:10,704
Dr. King,
are you all right?

1282
01:25:16,177 --> 01:25:19,113
- Dr. King, are you--
- Maybe there's something acting

1283
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:20,347
on these genes.

1284
01:25:20,349 --> 01:25:22,583
Maybe it's not
happening independently

1285
01:25:22,585 --> 01:25:24,885
or spontaneously.

1286
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:31,225
Controlling genes.

1287
01:25:31,227 --> 01:25:35,195
[Doctor]
Squeeze one more time
for me.

1288
01:25:35,197 --> 01:25:37,030
Okay. Okay.

1289
01:25:37,032 --> 01:25:41,101
Well, let's try
the other arm, hmm?

1290
01:25:41,103 --> 01:25:42,569
Sorry, Annie.

1291
01:25:42,571 --> 01:25:44,071
This happens

1292
01:25:44,073 --> 01:25:46,573
when you've had
too much chemo.

1293
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:48,509
The veins get scarred

1294
01:25:48,511 --> 01:25:51,044
and are hard to use.

1295
01:25:51,046 --> 01:25:54,248
Like a junkie.

1296
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:58,185
Well, next time,
I'll put in a portacath.

1297
01:25:58,187 --> 01:26:01,054
That'll last
several sessions.

1298
01:26:01,056 --> 01:26:02,689
Okay.

1299
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:05,092
Yeah? I think
we've found one.

1300
01:26:05,094 --> 01:26:07,027
- Yay.
- Right there.

1301
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:12,533
- Hey.
- Wow.

1302
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:15,002
Cancer<i> haute couture.</i>

1303
01:26:15,004 --> 01:26:17,671
Ta-da!

1304
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:19,740
Not a good look, then?

1305
01:26:19,742 --> 01:26:22,276
It's... a look.

1306
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:27,214
Thanks, Brian.

1307
01:26:27,216 --> 01:26:28,815
Thank you.

1308
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:33,954
- They're beautiful.
- You are.

1309
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:39,560
- What's going on?
- Excellent question.

1310
01:26:39,562 --> 01:26:40,827
Let me show you
what's going on.

1311
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:43,030
Maybe you can
figure it out for us.

1312
01:26:43,032 --> 01:26:45,365
Look around you.
What do you see?

1313
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,667
A lot of paper.

1314
01:26:46,669 --> 01:26:48,869
Each paper represents
parts of chromosomes

1315
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:50,270
that we suspect
may be active

1316
01:26:50,272 --> 01:26:52,039
in the cancer
of our test patients.

1317
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:54,007
In other words,
these areas are variants--

1318
01:26:54,009 --> 01:26:55,609
mutations in the DNA.

1319
01:26:55,611 --> 01:26:58,378
- Our 350--
all cancer sufferers.
- Why are there so many?

1320
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,681
Because it represents
many generations.

1321
01:27:00,683 --> 01:27:03,417
- See these red dots?
- Yeah.

1322
01:27:03,419 --> 01:27:07,254
Wherever they appear is
an indication of a mutation.

1323
01:27:07,256 --> 01:27:11,058
Black lines--
morbidity, death.

1324
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,527
So there's
a lot of mutation?

1325
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:16,330
Yeah. Everyone's DNA has
a certain amount of variation.

1326
01:27:16,332 --> 01:27:18,098
What we're looking for
is a mutation

1327
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,067
the same place
on the same chromosome.

1328
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:22,336
Mary-Claire, if we're looking
for patients who have

1329
01:27:22,338 --> 01:27:24,538
- ...a predisposition
to breast cancer--
- Yes.

1330
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:27,040
That would suggest that they
were born with a mutated gene.

1331
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:29,843
- Yes.
- But most cancers
occur later in life,

1332
01:27:29,845 --> 01:27:32,179
when the telomeres
are reduced in size.

1333
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:33,614
Right.

1334
01:27:33,616 --> 01:27:36,316
So if we concentrate on women
who have early-onset cancer,

1335
01:27:36,318 --> 01:27:38,752
we'd be much more likely
to find women

1336
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:40,020
who have a predisposition.

1337
01:27:40,022 --> 01:27:41,655
We were presuming
that all breast cancers

1338
01:27:41,657 --> 01:27:43,023
were caused
by the same thing.

1339
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:44,458
Yes, but if
they have similar tumors

1340
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,059
but different causes--
And we just look at women

1341
01:27:46,061 --> 01:27:48,829
with early-onset cancer...

1342
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:53,400
Do it.

1343
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:57,504
Average age, 28.

1344
01:27:57,506 --> 01:28:00,407
- 40.
- 35.

1345
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:06,580
Where is it?

1346
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,955
It's here.

1347
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:18,425
And here.

1348
01:28:18,427 --> 01:28:21,595
And here.

1349
01:28:21,597 --> 01:28:23,964
And here.

1350
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:25,999
And here.

1351
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:34,374
We found our gene.

1352
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:39,746
That's Mary-Claire King.

1353
01:28:39,748 --> 01:28:41,882
There's a link.
There's a link.

1354
01:28:41,884 --> 01:28:43,984
You understand
what I'm saying?

1355
01:28:43,986 --> 01:28:47,054
There's a genetic link

1356
01:28:47,056 --> 01:28:49,356
between mothers
and daughters

1357
01:28:49,358 --> 01:28:50,924
and sisters

1358
01:28:50,926 --> 01:28:53,660
who have had
breast cancer.

1359
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,595
See, there's
a predisposition.

1360
01:28:55,597 --> 01:28:57,964
A kind of mutation.

1361
01:28:57,966 --> 01:29:01,535
There's a link.

1362
01:29:01,537 --> 01:29:03,537
You were right.

1363
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:10,077
Excuse me.

1364
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:01,288
Hello. Hi.

1365
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,757
Hey, I heard
the good news.

1366
01:31:03,759 --> 01:31:06,560
Allen, she's in Cincinnati.

1367
01:31:06,562 --> 01:31:08,028
Cincinnati?

1368
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:09,896
They could
hardly believe it.

1369
01:31:09,898 --> 01:31:12,933
Yeah, well,
they believe her now, huh?

1370
01:31:12,935 --> 01:31:15,502
They do. Anybody who
ever doubted us.

1371
01:31:15,504 --> 01:31:17,404
Well, her. She did it.

1372
01:31:17,406 --> 01:31:19,339
- A single gene.
- Pretty much.

1373
01:31:19,341 --> 01:31:22,976
Incredible. So, what now?

1374
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,544
Oh, there's still
lots to be done.

1375
01:31:24,546 --> 01:31:27,547
We have to pinpoint
the precise gene
and sequence it.

1376
01:31:27,549 --> 01:31:30,350
Yeah, well, that's
where the money is.

1377
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:35,322
- The money?
- Yeah. Lots and lots
and lots of money.

1378
01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:38,124
You sequence the gene,
and then you patent it.

1379
01:31:38,126 --> 01:31:41,094
It's yours.
Do me a favor, will you?

1380
01:31:41,096 --> 01:31:45,031
Say good-bye
to Dr. King for me...

1381
01:31:45,033 --> 01:31:48,935
and, uh...

1382
01:31:48,937 --> 01:31:50,537
you know,
congrats and all that.

1383
01:31:50,539 --> 01:31:52,806
She is something.

1384
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:05,785
- Excuse me, Dr. King?
- I'm sorry.

1385
01:32:05,787 --> 01:32:08,288
I don't have any more time.
I'm already late for my plane.

1386
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:09,990
My name's Annie Parker.

1387
01:32:09,992 --> 01:32:11,825
Thanks.

1388
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:17,097
Oh.

1389
01:32:17,099 --> 01:32:19,232
I read your letters.

1390
01:32:19,234 --> 01:32:21,401
I heard you were in town.

1391
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:23,136
I tried to catch
your lecture,

1392
01:32:23,138 --> 01:32:25,505
but the traffic
was horrible.

1393
01:32:25,507 --> 01:32:27,674
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1394
01:32:27,676 --> 01:32:28,942
It was a bit dry.

1395
01:32:28,944 --> 01:32:32,279
My jokes didn't
play very well.

1396
01:32:32,281 --> 01:32:34,548
- So I--
- I've wanted to meet you.

1397
01:32:36,651 --> 01:32:39,753
I wanted to meet you, too.

1398
01:32:39,755 --> 01:32:43,690
So I heard they patented
our gene-- your gene.

1399
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:47,494
That's right. They have.

1400
01:32:47,496 --> 01:32:49,129
So does that mean
we get a discount on it

1401
01:32:49,131 --> 01:32:52,465
in the future if we need it,
like a Sears card?

1402
01:32:52,467 --> 01:32:55,669
It's not a cure, of course.

1403
01:32:55,671 --> 01:32:58,371
No. Yeah. I heard,

1404
01:32:58,373 --> 01:33:00,407

1405
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:03,810

01:33:03,812 --> 01:33:06,780

- Thank you.

It was my mom's.
I had it restrung recently.

01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:13,553
- You know, she--
- Hey, I'm sorry.

1409
01:33:13,555 --> 01:33:16,323
I really do have to go.
I hope we can speak again.

1410
01:33:16,325 --> 01:33:19,125
All the best.
