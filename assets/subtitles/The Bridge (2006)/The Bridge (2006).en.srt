1
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,353
It was sort of a weird day.

2
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:45,447
The wind was lightish,
and I was just kiting there.

3
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,392
I cut over to the south tower
and some stuff fell,

4
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,190
so I cut back the other way,

5
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:55,063
and I just saw a mass
falling towards my kite

6
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,671
and I thought it was the same thing.

7
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,604
So I turned the kite back,
and then I looked over,

8
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:06,304
and before they hit, I realized
it was a person that had jumped.

9
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:11,315
So then I cut over just to see,
or maybe possibly help.

10
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,615
The current just sucked him under,
and I stayed in the tide

11
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,282
because I knew that the Coast Guard
would come.

12
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,089
That's when it became more
of a surreal experience to me

13
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,961
because I've seen
the Coast Guard boat a million times,

14
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:29,432
and they've helped us out and
rescued us when we have problems,

15
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,732
but they're all wearing
the white hazmat suits,

16
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,674
and that's when I realized that
there was definitely a person and...

17
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,617
I never knew
the real scale of the problem.

18
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,650
I don't know,
the whole thing is crazy to me.

19
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,655
I mean, I just don't even
understand it really.

20
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,587
When I was riding back
after that time,

21
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:57,254
I was thinking
about how that person was

22
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:01,060
at the lowest of the low
of their life, obviously.

23
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,330
And how the whole day
all I could think about,

24
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,667
"It's going to be a good day
to go out and kite

25
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,832
and pack my passion sport."

26
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,909
And here, at the same time,
you know,

27
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,468
I am reaching, you know,
for what I love to do.

28
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,810
And this person is ending their life.

29
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,043
So that was unreal.

30
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,952
Yeah, exactly. Kiting is,
to me, a real celebration of life.

31
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,854
It's exhilarating.
It's thrilling.

32
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,550
It's just awesome.

33
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,128
So, it's a real juxtaposition

34
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,459
of celebration of life
and ending of life.

35
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,785
It was one
of those epic days in San Francisco,

36
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,324
driving across
the Golden Gate Bridge.

37
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,520
It was crystal clear,
the bay was calm,

38
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,257
there were tourists
walking across the bridge.

39
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:10,926
And usually on those types of days
I always soak in the beauty of the bay

40
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,631
and look over to Alcatraz.

41
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,042
And on that particular day,
I looked over.

42
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,613
I was probably a little bit
more than mid span

43
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:27,744
when I saw this gentleman
on the railings.

44
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,788
And, at first glance, I thought,

45
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,323
"Wow, this guy looks
like he's going to bungee jump."

46
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:36,259
Because of the way
that he was standing on the railing,

47
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,422
and then common sense kicked in
and said, "You can't."

48
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,863
My thoughts were,

49
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:45,131
"You couldn't jump off the bridge.
Bungee jump off the bridge."

50
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:50,232
And then he just kind of held
his arms out and disappeared.

51
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:54,109
And I wasn't sure
if I was imagining this.

52
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:58,479
And so I drove for a few seconds
and looked in my rearview mirror.

53
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,518
And my heart rate went up,

54
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,182
and I almost felt
like I wanted to start crying

55
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,785
because I thought to myself, "Wow,
I might be one of the last people

56
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,229
that have ever seen
this person alive."

57
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,557
When I went into the tower,

58
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,034
and I talked
to the highway patrolman,

59
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,162
I asked him, blatantly, I said,

60
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,070
"Is this a rare occurrence
or does this happen often?"

61
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,374
And he looked at me
and kind of smiled and just said,

62
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,210
"It happens all the time."

63
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,777
It's hard to define Gene
as a person.

64
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,643
He was...

65
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:10,656
...just not of this world,
I think, is really the truth of it.

66
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,886
Not of this world, as we know it.

67
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:22,224
His mother was a woman who said,
"Oh, I never want children."

68
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,893
And then...

69
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,135
...a few years later,
she found herself pregnant...

70
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,403
...and decided...

71
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:36,739
...to have the child rather than leave
the country for an alternative.

72
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,374
And she was looking forward to it.

73
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:43,478
And so came my friend Gene,

74
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,320
who was always referred to
as my little brother, Thump.

75
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,759
He was born an old man.

76
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:57,226
And all their lives, it was just
the two of them, pretty much.

77
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:01,534
People came and went in their lives,
as in relationships of various sorts.

78
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:05,634
But it was mostly just always
the two of them,

79
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,873
dependent on each other for...

80
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,509
...that stability that...

81
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,153
...one thinks of as,

82
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:20,123
"Tomorrow is coming, and we
will do this and we will do that."

83
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,193
Growing up with Lisa in Marin,

84
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:32,362
she was just, like, completely normal
until she was, like, 14.

85
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,003
I'm 4 years older, and I moved away.
I lived in Alaska.

86
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,837
And my mom would write me and say,

87
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:42,677
"Hey, Lisa's acting strange
and doing these things."

88
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,513
And I kept telling her it was
typical teenage stuff,

89
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:50,851
and I came back 10 months later,
and there was a big change.

90
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,391
Our upbringing was...

91
00:09:54,694 --> 00:10:00,655
...was fabulous, I would say, until my
father suddenly died when I was 14.

92
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,360
Well, that was a shock.
That threw all three of us...

93
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,802
But didn't make
Jeff and I mentally ill,

94
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,739
but Lisa had a different personality.

95
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,240
She wasn't as outgoing
as my brother or I.

96
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,974
- And she was just...
- She was more angelic.

97
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,415
We went through all the counselors

98
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,717
and finally got her
to go to a psychiatrist.

99
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,223
And he said,

100
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:31,888
"Lisa is a paranoid schizophrenic,
and she will never recover."

101
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:35,097
That was a terrible thing
to tell a mother.

102
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,499
He says,
"You have to take her right now

103
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,969
to the Crisis Center
at Marin General."

104
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,972
She immediately, when we got there,

105
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,702
got on the pay phone
and started calling her friends

106
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,372
and telling them how terrible I was
to bring her to this place.

107
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:54,215
Well, they brought her
into the Crisis Unit, and, you know,

108
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,814
for all the bad things
she did when she was home,

109
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:04,191
she straightened up,
acted as if she was perfectly normal.

110
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,127
And they discharged her.

111
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,597
We went through that several times.

112
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,099
She had her own style.

113
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,337
She liked to wear headbands.
She liked to wear black.

114
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,142
Black leather headbands
with rhinestones.

115
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:28,414
- And matching gloves with no fingers.
- And she always wore bicycle gloves.

116
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,716
No, Harley Rider gloves.

117
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,916
- You know, leather.
- Leather.

118
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,153
- Leather gloves, yes.
- She was a leather queen.

119
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,107
I met Gene
at a comic-book convention

120
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,840
in Oakland.

121
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,915
We just hit it off immediately.

122
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,575
By looking at us,
you wouldn't think

123
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:04,554
that we would become
such tight friends, but we did.

124
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,991
You know, he looked
like the cool rocker type.

125
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,895
You know, long hair, you know,
everything about him is,

126
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,865
you know, just cool,
and the ladies like it and...

127
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:20,405
And I was Mr. Hip-Hop.
Other side of the spectrum and stuff.

128
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,064
Everything was black.

129
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:25,143
His clothes were black.
His hair was black.

130
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:31,244
The curtains were black.
The walls were black.

131
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,841
The sheets were black.

132
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,854
He just wanted...

133
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:42,756
It's as though he wanted
no contrasts.

134
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:47,364
He mostly just wanted
to be in his room with his computer.

135
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:49,631
Me and Gene had long talks

136
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:54,296
about love and where
he's trying to find it.

137
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:57,897
And I told him he's not going
to find it on the Internet.

138
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:59,476
A lot of times
he didn't want to hear it.

139
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:02,478
He just wanted what he saw.

140
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,845
He would send me pictures
of these girls, and I'm like...

141
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:09,447
"Dude, what are you doing?"
You know?

142
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:10,714
That's not...

143
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:12,255
That ain't it, you know.

144
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:16,623
I'm like, "Take time,
get to know this person.

145
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:18,992
You don't know this person
from nothing.

146
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:21,395
Just because you read a bio
about this person,

147
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:25,026
and this person wants to
turn around and have sex with you,

148
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:27,434
that's not love, you know.

149
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:40,383
I noticed early on...

150
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:45,481
...that Lisa was very interested
in romance.

151
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:50,319
And I saw her go through
some very painful rejections.

152
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:54,387
She met a guy,
this was just before Christmas.

153
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:57,832
She took off with him on a bus.

154
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:01,235
She was gone for a week.
We had no idea where she was.

155
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:05,799
She was off her medication,
and I was wrapping gifts.

156
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,142
All of a sudden, I looked up,
and there was Lisa outside

157
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:12,773
just really in a bad state.

158
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:16,253
She thought our dogs were devils.

159
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:20,154
And she broke a clock because
she thought it was a time bomb.

160
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:22,590
I had to have the police come out.

161
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:24,457
But before they would admit her,

162
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:26,655
she had to have
a court order to get in,

163
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:31,258
because she'd been in and out
of the Crisis so many times.

164
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,864
Being a schizophrenic
is like watching TV

165
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:39,034
and having 44 channels on
at the same time.

166
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:42,408
And that's her environment 24-7.

167
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:45,971
You know, there's just
little noises here, something there.

168
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:47,745
And I'm trying to talk here,

169
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:50,446
but that's distracting me,
that's distracting me,

170
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:51,681
and it's all equal.

171
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:54,686
That would freak anybody out.

172
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:09,839
She graduated from house to house

173
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:13,104
to a home where
there was constant care.

174
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:16,647
And finally to independent living

175
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:18,648
for about 15 years.

176
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,183
- That place was great.
- And she had her own room.

177
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:24,016
She had a very nice situation there.
She liked it there.

178
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:27,649
But one of her roommates there, right,
jumped off the bridge, too?

179
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,284
- Well, no. This was a friend.
- A friend.

180
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,590
- A friend of hers.
- Two years ago?

181
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:34,426
- No, it was longer than that.
- Longer than that.

182
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:36,056
Much longer.

183
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:40,527
As far as pills
and other forms of suicide,

184
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:44,335
I haven't personally experienced
that in my houses.

185
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:47,774
It's like, the last three people,
I think,

186
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,873
who I was kind of close to
in Buckaloo were all bridge jumpers.

187
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,821
After she settled in Marin...

188
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,920
- She did well there.
... she was pretty stable.

189
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:08,760
Then all of a sudden, this past year,

190
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:11,733
she just felt she needed
more support for some reason.

191
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:13,804
Do you think
that was the medication change?

192
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:16,430
No, I think it was
because she was ill.

193
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,475
Oh, because she wasn't feeling good.

194
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:23,810
Her teeth were just so rotted,
and they felt it was from medication,

195
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:25,849
and from drinking a lot of Coke.

196
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,418
So she had to have
all her teeth removed.

197
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,453
So she looked kind of funny
walking around with no teeth.

198
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:33,615
That was a problem, too.

199
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:37,459
Just from then on downhill.

200
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:49,498
The Golden Gate Bridge
was designed by Joseph Strauss.

201
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:52,235
It opened in 1937.

202
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:55,835
Each year, about 9 million tourists
come to visit...

203
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:59,041
Well, we went for Easter vacation,

204
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:02,710
to take out the kids
to San Francisco.

205
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:05,515
Before going to the Alcatraz...

206
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:10,123
Before going to the Golden Bridge
we went to Alcatraz, and we went to...

207
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:12,963
...the Pier 39,

208
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:18,127
and from there, we took a walk
to the Golden Gate.

209
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:23,673
We had a big dinner on...

210
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:26,972
The week before Easter.
- Week before, yeah, Palm Sunday.

211
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:30,536
So I said, "Lisa, I'm not going to fix
a big dinner on Easter Sunday."

212
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:32,741
The kids weren't going to be around.

213
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:37,749
Except that was a tradition
in our family, to get together.

214
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:41,416
But, well, she didn't seem to mind.
She never objected.

215
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:46,555
So, I called her about 1:00.
She didn't feel good that week.

216
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:48,188
She still didn't go to work.

217
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:49,231
And so I said,

218
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,894
"Well, I guess I could come down,
but I don't know what I can do."

219
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:02,244
Lisa was so quiet
and oftentimes had this...

220
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:05,577
I don't know how you'd say it,
poker face?

221
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:07,708
She kept her feelings to herself.

222
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:11,721
She wasn't one to,
you know, get all emotional.

223
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:15,919
Which surprised me, because
I look back now at Mira Woods...

224
00:18:16,027 --> 00:18:17,654
We were walking down the little trail,

225
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:23,291
and there was this huge redwood tree
lying in the middle of the path.

226
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:26,097
And she looked at it, and she goes,
"Wow, look at that!"

227
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,331
And it sounds like no big deal,
but for Lisa that was like...

228
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:32,033
That was different.

229
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,575
And then she came home,

230
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:37,079
and I guess she was hungry,
and she asked a girl there,

231
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:38,614
"Did you fix dinner?"

232
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:42,015
And they said, "No."
So then they said she was very quiet.

233
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,420
She got in the freezer and took
something out and fixed it herself.

234
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:48,719
And after she had eaten...

235
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:51,522
They said she was very quiet
when she was eating.

236
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:56,657
She got up and took her purse
and her jacket, and off she went.

237
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,065
And that's the last they saw her.

238
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,475
We were taking pictures of each other.

239
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,878
And I was taking pictures to them.

240
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:17,182
And Paulo was taking pictures to us,
and they were playing.

241
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:20,318
- And I got scared.
- He was holding the baby.

242
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:23,052
And we were walking and...

243
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:25,562
And we saw that lady.

244
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,824
The lady just put the...

245
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:30,799
The bag on the ground,
and she jumped off.

246
00:19:30,968 --> 00:19:34,165
I said, "She jumped!
She jumped!" And I was like...

247
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:39,107
And she told my brother
to go call the cops.

248
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,771
Well, Paulo went running down
to get some help,

249
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,871
because I wanted
somebody to help her.

250
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:49,851
Because for us, it was the first time
to see somebody jump off the bridge.

251
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:57,425
And before she jumped, she looked
at me and Vidarlan, she was laughing.

252
00:19:57,528 --> 00:20:01,157
She laughed, like a smile, like,
"You don't know what I'm going to do."

253
00:20:01,265 --> 00:20:03,893
She smiled and jumped.

254
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:10,398
She was acting
like a gorilla or something.

255
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,169
Ay! Sebastian!

256
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:14,404
No, that's not it.

257
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:18,072
He likes to make things up.

258
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:30,320
I'm not 100% convinced
that she did commit suicide.

259
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:33,124
I don't know if someone
had accompanied her

260
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:36,723
to the Golden Gate Bridge
and had encouraged her to jump.

261
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:40,702
I don't know if someone
had been pressuring her

262
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:43,000
to go to the Golden Gate Bridge
and jump.

263
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:46,668
And certainly, it is a highly risky,

264
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:53,716
rather glorious,
way to draw attention to oneself.

265
00:20:57,421 --> 00:21:00,151
My brother is very religious.

266
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,616
He doesn't believe
she committed suicide.

267
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:05,662
He thinks it's something else.
I don't know what he thinks.

268
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:06,752
I didn't know that.

269
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:08,058
Well, he won't call it that

270
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:11,794
because it's a sin to commit suicide,
in his mind,

271
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:14,427
and that's not what she did.

272
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:16,899
She fell or something.
I don't know.

273
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:20,876
He's coming up
with different justifications so...

274
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:24,414
...he can look at it...
- He doesn't talk to me like that.

275
00:21:25,516 --> 00:21:28,610
The thing is, if you go
stand on that bridge and look down,

276
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:33,416
the amount of guts that you have to
have to stick anything over that rail.

277
00:21:34,158 --> 00:21:37,650
It must have been incredible,
the pressure on her.

278
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:40,424
It had to be worse
than the thought of doing that.

279
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:44,591
And I've always thought of myself
as the stronger person than her,

280
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:47,466
and there's no way
I would have the guts to do that.

281
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:50,506
Even with, you know,
a parachute or something.

282
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:54,510
And for her to just do it,
and just like that, I was like...

283
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:56,603
We still can't...
I still can't believe it.

284
00:21:56,714 --> 00:22:00,673
My family, my husband,
my kids, we were like,

285
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:03,253
"How did she even think
about doing that?"

286
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:06,949
I think it was a relief.
A relief for her.

287
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:11,961
Because she knew that she probably
never would be physically well again.

288
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:14,463
And she knew she had
the mental illness,

289
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:18,092
and she was just
at the end of her rope.

290
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:20,466
There were too many things.

291
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:23,064
- Yeah, I agree with that, but it's...
- She's in a better place.

292
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:24,766
That's all I can say.

293
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,537
You have to look at it that way.

294
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:29,112
You know.

295
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:06,941
Yeah, I try and relive,
you know, when doing some things,

296
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:10,987
if it's something Philip likes,
or my son would like this, or...

297
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:14,250
He still lives with me, you know.

298
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:17,155
I go somewhere,
a ball game or something...

299
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:19,656
...he's there.

300
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:26,560
I think I'm getting more
of an understanding

301
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,468
of what he went through
toward the end.

302
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:32,404
Because you feel the same way.
It's just...

303
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,673
What makes
any of us go over that line?

304
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,675
Well, you know, it's just...

305
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:42,849
Some days you think
like that yourself.

306
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:46,013
It's just he thought
about it every day.

307
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:47,787
Yeah.

308
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:55,293
What makes a person
be able to do that?

309
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,390
I don't know.
I don't have the answer to that.

310
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:03,271
It's like any pain,
and when it becomes unbearable...

311
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:04,602
...you'll do anything.

312
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,608
And it's like physical cancer.

313
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,077
I mean, if you have cancer
of the mind...

314
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:13,745
...you know, nobody knows
what you are going through.

315
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:22,590
I mean,
it was like our hands being tied.

316
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:24,957
No matter how much
we talked to him.

317
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:27,688
I mean,
he was in and out of the hospital.

318
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:30,164
The doctors talked to him, and...

319
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:35,972
...it was like nothing
would change his mind.

320
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:40,803
In fact, I think the medicines
made him worse.

321
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:45,003
We thought, you know, if we
can get him through his episodes...

322
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:46,639
Well, that's the crazy thing.

323
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,480
As soon as you get somebody
strong enough...

324
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:52,283
...that's when they have the courage.

325
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:58,460
So, do you make them well,
or do you keep them sick? I mean...

326
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:05,098
He tried it a few times, but...

327
00:25:05,202 --> 00:25:06,863
The second attempt, he said,

328
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:08,802
"My third attempt
is not going to fail."

329
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:11,136
He said, "I'll make sure of it."

330
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:16,976
He researched it and found the
Golden Gate Bridge on the Internet.

331
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:19,572
He said, to him, it was the best way.

332
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:23,449
I mean, it was planned out for months,

333
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:27,718
and the final 2 weeks he was making
his, you know, last preparations.

334
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:33,830
He said whether some people
believed suicide's a sin or not.

335
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:35,789
He asked that a lot.

336
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:39,894
I said that's something man made up.

337
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:46,699
At least he thanked me for telling him
the truth, you know, it's just...

338
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:48,978
You know, I don't know.

339
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:52,708
You know, it's just I don't think
God's going to hold you responsible

340
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:55,114
for something you can't handle.

341
00:25:55,252 --> 00:25:57,948
And he said,
"Well, whether I come back or not..."

342
00:25:58,055 --> 00:26:01,149
He says, you know,
"If I do, I'll see you again, Dad.

343
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:04,455
If not, just know that I'm at peace."

344
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:17,731
What I'm trying to say
is that I didn't want him to feel

345
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:20,776
like he was in a cage
inside of himself.

346
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:25,645
Some people say the body's a temple,
but he thought his body was a prison.

347
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:27,376
In his mind...

348
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:30,214
He knew he was loved,
he knew he had everything,

349
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:35,088
can do anything,
and yet, he felt trapped.

350
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,825
And that was the only way
he could get free.

351
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:58,041
Gene was very overly dramatic.

352
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:01,709
Even the simplest things
were very long and drawn out

353
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:03,286
and very hard and...

354
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:06,083
He would always say things like,
"Kill me now."

355
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,852
You'd be talking about something
and ask him,

356
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:12,417
"What do you want for breakfast?"
"Oh, I don't care. Just kill me."

357
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:15,793
"Okay, well, where do you want
to go look for a job today?"

358
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:17,867
"I don't care. It's not going
to matter. Just kill me."

359
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:19,993
Yeah, "Might be easier
for you to just kill me."

360
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:22,732
You didn't take him serious
if he said certain things,

361
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,671
because he would
almost say it in a joking manner.

362
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:28,040
He wouldn't say it
with, like, this intensity of...

363
00:27:28,812 --> 00:27:30,939
...you know, like,
"I'm going to do it this time."

364
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:32,913
And, you know,
he wasn't that person.

365
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:34,245
He would make light of it.

366
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:36,581
He's like, "Man, I'm going to just
commit suicide.

367
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:38,484
I'm going to just, you know,
shoot myself.

368
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:40,318
I'm going to do it
with a bow and arrow."

369
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:43,621
And when he would say this stuff,
we were just like, "Yeah, whatever."

370
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:48,562
And years and years and years
would go by as he's crying wolf.

371
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:54,131
But he was still fun to be around.

372
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:58,004
I mean, when I hear myself saying it,
it sounds like he wasn't fun.

373
00:27:58,108 --> 00:27:59,234
I mean, he was fun to be around.

374
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:02,972
He was fun to go out with
and go to clubs with and stuff.

375
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,346
He would just get in those little
funks, and pretty soon it was...

376
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:09,779
...just like I didn't even...

377
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:13,379
I didn't even pay it any attention.
It was just something he said.

378
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,618
All the time.
In every conversation.

379
00:28:18,595 --> 00:28:22,087
If everyone onboard could take
their seats as we go under the bridge.

380
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:25,635
The swells and tides
are very unpredictable.

381
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,728
The Golden Gate Bridge
is 1.2 miles long,

382
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,435
and the towers are 746 feet tall.

383
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:38,277
The roadway is suspended 220 feet
above the water at the center span.

384
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:42,678
The Golden Gate Bridge
is the most photographed

385
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:45,118
man-made structure in North America.

386
00:28:45,222 --> 00:28:50,023
And it is considered one of the
Seven Wonders of the Modern World.

387
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:54,053
We had gone to Montana,
Glacier National Park,

388
00:28:54,164 --> 00:28:57,292
the year before,
and Philip had a blast there.

389
00:28:57,401 --> 00:29:00,598
We told him if he got out
of the Army in time, which he did,

390
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:02,262
that we were going back there.

391
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:05,739
And they had those forest fires,
so we couldn't get in,

392
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:08,471
so I had been
to San Francisco before,

393
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,308
and I said, "You'll love it there."

394
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,575
And the bridge fascinated him.

395
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:13,843
For some reason, yeah.

396
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:15,646
When we were driving
across the bridge,

397
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:18,153
he just kept, like,
looking around and...

398
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:20,951
I just thought it was kind of odd
that he would just be...

399
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:23,219
And he wanted to get out, you know.

400
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:25,591
He says,
"Can we walk along the bridge?"

401
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:29,091
I say, "I guess there are people
who can walk along the bridge."

402
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,496
Yeah, we were on a tour bus.

403
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:34,503
Yeah, I say,
"But we can't get out now."

404
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:38,836
He just kept looking out the window
like he wanted to get out

405
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:40,876
and just look around and...

406
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:45,981
You know, he thought
it was just so beautiful,

407
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:50,417
and when we did get out of the bus,
he wanted his picture taken,

408
00:29:50,521 --> 00:29:54,457
a few times with the bridge
in the background.

409
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,418
He'd ask questions,
"How deep do you think it is?

410
00:29:57,528 --> 00:30:00,053
How high do you think it is?"

411
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,797
I mean, I liked the bridge, too.
I mean, but...

412
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:09,202
I mean, he just seemed
so fascinated by it, and I just...

413
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:14,209
Just thought that was kind of odd,
to have such a fascination with it.

414
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:16,040
I don't know, it was like,

415
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:20,014
almost calling him, you know,
type thing, it was...

416
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:22,846
...like, magnetic to him.
- Yeah.

417
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:26,318
I don't know.

418
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,958
We thought he might
go on to live out there.

419
00:30:32,062 --> 00:30:35,589
Even if he's homeless,
at least it's a city he loves.

420
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,893
Because he was homeless in Texas,
living out of his car.

421
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:40,797
Met two girls online.

422
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:44,663
Went down twice.
Those didn't work.

423
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:48,511
He always fell in love
with the wrong person, you know.

424
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:51,445
I think everything
just disillusioned him.

425
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:55,040
He had this idealistic view of things

426
00:30:55,152 --> 00:31:00,317
and this perception
of how everything should be.

427
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:03,587
And then when it didn't
meet up to his expectations...

428
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:08,158
After a while, it was like,
"What's the point, then?"

429
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:13,329
But he still had to make a choice.

430
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:23,740
Gene's choice,
his preference,

431
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:25,815
had been made years before.

432
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:28,350
He became increasingly alienated,

433
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:32,684
and he had told his mother
that he wanted to kill himself.

434
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:35,314
And she, in essence, had told him,

435
00:31:35,425 --> 00:31:40,294
"I didn't invest a lifetime in you
to have you die on me.

436
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:42,490
Kill yourself and walk away.

437
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:46,868
You don't have a right to do that
while I'm alive."

438
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:54,538
And I think it was very hard for him
to watch his mother's

439
00:31:54,645 --> 00:32:00,584
non-participation in a battle
with cancer that she might have won.

440
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:03,848
It was a choice on her part.

441
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:09,919
When I talked to him,
he was acting as if life goes on,

442
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:13,463
you know, type of situation and,
you know, and...

443
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:15,125
I'd always tell him,

444
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:18,360
"I'm here for you.
You still got family no matter what."

445
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:21,597
You know, I'm a brother
from another mother.

446
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,768
He said to me,

447
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:28,339
after she was gone, and there was
a lot of stuff to clean up.

448
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:32,245
And he said,
"Well, now I can finally...

449
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:34,817
Now I can finally end it all."

450
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:40,285
And I looked at him, and I said,
"Well, you will promise me

451
00:32:40,457 --> 00:32:44,257
that you will not go
without saying good-bye."

452
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,703
I remember coming home,

453
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:57,330
because Thursday night's
garbage day,

454
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:59,238
and Friday's recycling day.

455
00:32:59,343 --> 00:33:01,436
And Philip even did that
before he left.

456
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:04,639
He took the recycling things
out to the curb.

457
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:08,108
I came home that Friday, and...

458
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:09,685
They were empty, and I said,

459
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:13,244
"That's unusual for him
not to bring the buckets back in."

460
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:16,591
And when I came in the house,
and as soon as she said,

461
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:22,188
"Where's Philip? Isn't he with you?"
And I was like, he did it. I knew.

462
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:27,999
And it's the hard part for me.

463
00:33:28,872 --> 00:33:32,467
I had a feeling it was going
to be in San Francisco, but I said,

464
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:34,443
"If he's in San Francisco,

465
00:33:34,544 --> 00:33:39,572
and I call the police to stop him,
if I have time yet...

466
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:41,981
...then he's going to
just hang himself

467
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:44,815
or have the policeman shoot him."

468
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:49,858
And I said, "If he's that determined,
I have to let him go."

469
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:55,321
But when she asked me, I said,
"No, he's not coming home."

470
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:59,799
From the death certificate,
he was already, you know, done.

471
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,996
It was just waiting for the policeman
to show up at the door.

472
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,883
We just came around the corner

473
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:25,655
after snapping the shot
of San Francisco in the backdrop,

474
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:27,229
and he was right there.

475
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,595
Yeah, sort of surprised him.
Yeah, we startled him.

476
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,962
We came up upon him.

477
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:34,264
He was taking off his backpack.

478
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:36,737
In hindsight, he was probably
getting ready to jump.

479
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,243
Then he put back his backpack
on really quickly and acted nervous.

480
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:44,609
And we interrupted him.
We interrupted him from jumping.

481
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:50,852
And you spoke with him,
because you noticed something odd.

482
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:53,889
Yeah, his whole body language,
his whole energy was...

483
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,218
It was just a bit off.

484
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:58,556
He was definitely nervous,
and he had a shuffle in his shoulder,

485
00:34:58,662 --> 00:35:02,826
and I initially, you know,
picked up on that and said,

486
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:05,663
"Are you okay?
What's going on?"

487
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,870
And at that point,
he made brief eye contact.

488
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:11,031
- Well-dressed guy.
- Yeah.

489
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:13,132
Brief eye contact, too.
He was very nervous.

490
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:14,938
He wouldn't look you in the eye
for very long.

491
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:18,037
He just kept darting away,
looking away.

492
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:22,180
You know, and his biggest concern
when you asked him,

493
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:23,547
"Are you all right?"...

494
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,812
...he said, "It's a long way
down to the water."

495
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:30,256
- No, he said, "It's a long way down."
- Long way down, right.

496
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:35,493
I didn't know how to quite take that
when I heard him say that.

497
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,396
And I didn't know
if I heard him correctly.

498
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:39,162
I thought maybe he had meant
it's a long way back

499
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:40,827
to the other side of the bridge.

500
00:35:40,937 --> 00:35:43,201
And here I am thinking, "Well,
you are three-quarters of the way.

501
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:44,534
You're close."

502
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:46,768
And of course that wasn't the case.

503
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:48,469
And we didn't see him jump.

504
00:35:48,578 --> 00:35:49,875
Did not see him jump.

505
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:08,223
For me, he said he was
just going to go down so deep

506
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:11,459
that even if he changed his mind,
he couldn't swim to the top.

507
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:13,627
But the coroner
said it was over instantly.

508
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,638
Boy, imagine
what this looks like to people.

509
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:25,180
They probably look at us and say,

510
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:26,977
"What kind of mother
and father were they?"

511
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,482
Yeah.

512
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:31,052
I wasn't perfect.

513
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:35,150
But I mean, I don't think
I was such a terrible mother.

514
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:41,586
And then, I remember
Sharon said to me,

515
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:46,567
"You know, it's not all about you.
It has nothing to do with you."

516
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:53,936
Yeah. I mean, I was raised
in a family dysfunctional.

517
00:36:54,044 --> 00:36:55,409
Yeah, so was I.

518
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:57,878
My father was alcoholic,
hers was alcoholic.

519
00:36:57,981 --> 00:37:00,814
They fought
like cats and dogs, you know.

520
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:02,015
The abuse...

521
00:37:02,118 --> 00:37:05,019
I should be an alcoholic.
I should be a serial killer.

522
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:10,216
You think you are raising
your family to be, you know,

523
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:13,023
religious or whatever,
and you try and do the best,

524
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:16,997
but you wind up doing more things
that are harmful.

525
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:20,664
And then when you try and fix them,
you might be too late.

526
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:26,207
And it's like, well, no matter
what you do, good or bad, it's...

527
00:37:26,309 --> 00:37:28,072
You know, things are going to happen.

528
00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:33,377
And he said,
"If you and Mom, who I love,

529
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:36,919
you know, are having problems,
what hope is there for me?"

530
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,786
He says, "I think, you know, you loved
me the most and tried your best."

531
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,859
And he said, "If you're
having problems, you know,

532
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,019
there's no way I can make it."

533
00:37:56,806 --> 00:38:00,207
Took a lot of pictures
while he was on the bridge.

534
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,902
Yeah.

535
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:06,474
He wanted to show
what he was seeing...

536
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:09,076
...what he was feeling.

537
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,786
I was taking pictures
of Alcatraz at the time.

538
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,292
And while I was taking the picture,
I saw out of the corner of my eye

539
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,622
a girl walking by.

540
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,991
And she climbed over the rail.

541
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,861
And she did it so smoothly,

542
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,797
it was almost like she
was going to a little...

543
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,097
Like she had her own little clubhouse.

544
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:44,004
I don't know, like she was going
to sit on the ledge to eat lunch.

545
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:50,636
So I got a couple pictures
of her climbing over.

546
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,478
And then I started taking pictures
of her standing on the ledge,

547
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:57,281
and I realized that this girl
was about to jump.

548
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:01,318
But when I was behind the camera,
it was almost like it wasn't real,

549
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,916
because I was looking
through the lens.

550
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:09,156
I was actually, like...
I guess I was waiting for her to jump,

551
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,929
because I thought there was
nothing I could do. It was too late.

552
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,809
Earlier, I was actually
staring down at the ledge

553
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,071
in a couple different points
on the bridge,

554
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,340
and I was just trying
to think to myself

555
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,177
what goes through people's minds

556
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:29,548
whenever they are standing on that
ledge, and they are about to jump off.

557
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,951
Like, what's the last thing
they are thinking of?

558
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,820
Or, like, are they thinking
anything at all?

559
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,517
They just had enough,
and they just go,

560
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:40,393
and that's it, they are gone.

561
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,366
I started yelling out to the girl,
you know, asking her what was wrong.

562
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,603
She seemed to be speaking
in a different language.

563
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,703
And basically, like, tuning me out.

564
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,647
Like, really not thinking
about what I was saying.

565
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:05,448
So, I got up on the rail,
and I reached out,

566
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,751
and I really didn't know
I was going to be able to grab

567
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,689
the back of her jacket,
but once I grabbed it,

568
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:14,992
I just lifted her over the rail
and got her down on the ground.

569
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,226
She started to fight me a little bit.

570
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:21,964
So I just sat on her chest
and just called 911.

571
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:25,269
And they were probably there
within a couple minutes.

572
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,272
As crazy as it sounds,
I think of myself

573
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,842
like a National Geographic
photographer must feel.

574
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,115
And he's behind the camera filming,

575
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,919
and there's a big tiger,
and it's running at him.

576
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,823
And he's like,
"This footage is so great."

577
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,920
He forgets that in a couple seconds,

578
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:50,125
that tiger is going to be
on top of him.

579
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,692
But it's like you're in that camera,
you're just behind,

580
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,295
and you don't really think
about what's going on.

581
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,570
And that's where I had to separate,
or had to actually get out

582
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:03,408
of that mode of thinking
and actually act on it

583
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,448
and do something to help her.

584
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:12,879
After I left the bridge patrol,
I was going back to my vehicle,

585
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:17,086
and I happened to look over, and it
kind of looked like she turned back.

586
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,287
And she looked right at me.

587
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,591
And it freaked me out for a second.

588
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,633
I just didn't expect her
to look back now.

589
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,499
I don't know if she actually saw me

590
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:32,633
and was thinking like, "You son
of a bitch, I wanted to jump."

591
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,405
Or whatever it was...

592
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,975
...that she was thinking.

593
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:45,745
I'm sure that in some way
she did want to be rescued,

594
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:50,725
because if she really wanted to
commit suicide and just take that...

595
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:55,131
...basically, like, ultimate shortcut
to the next level

596
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:58,963
that she would have just climbed over
and just jumped right off.

597
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,304
So, I think that she was

598
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:04,340
sort of crying out for help there
a little bit.

599
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,510
The police did tell me
that she was involved

600
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:12,480
in another incident on the bridge,
and they talked her out of it.

601
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,679
And I just hope that she's doing okay.

602
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:55,353
Gene had a lot riding
on this relationship,

603
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:56,892
and he wanted
to get out of California,

604
00:44:56,994 --> 00:45:00,225
and he felt that it was going
to be like a new beginning.

605
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,958
And I think he had...

606
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:06,432
He had it planned out in his head
how it was going to happen.

607
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,663
And then when he got there,

608
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:11,229
the reality wasn't quite the same
as what was in his head.

609
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,809
Yeah, I think he was chasing

610
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:18,676
a certain magical wonderland that
would make all his problems go away

611
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:22,445
and making excuses
as to why he couldn't find it here,

612
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,316
expecting to find it somewhere else.

613
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,616
He just wanted
to make it happen so bad.

614
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,624
That's why he went to St. Louis.

615
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,893
Only love, really love.

616
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:40,766
Feeling like he was loved
and in love was going to save him.

617
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:46,270
And who's to say
that this is not a genetic thing?

618
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,401
Who's to say that
that wasn't the reason

619
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:52,539
his mother chose to have this child,
because she, too, was depressed,

620
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:58,087
and knew that she could keep
herself here and functional

621
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,213
if she had a commitment?

622
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:07,559
How do we know that it wasn't
at some inner level

623
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:10,690
that he perceived this, very young,

624
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:17,730
and that it colored his needs
to have someone depend on him?

625
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,033
I don't know.

626
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:02,682
The ideas of suicide, if
I'm completely honest with myself,

627
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:05,050
have been there for a long, long time.

628
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,715
Years, way before I was diagnosed.

629
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:12,319
But I was just touching on it, like,
you know, "Oh, I'll just kill myself."

630
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:16,331
But the real thought process
of actually going to do it

631
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:22,633
and commit the act
started, I'd say, about '99.

632
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,503
And that's when I cut my wrists.

633
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,736
At the end of his junior year
in high school,

634
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,904
he had huge mood swings.

635
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:37,444
During his senior year,
they were just compelling.

636
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:41,820
I mean, he was constantly
either very high or very low.

637
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:45,985
That was really a fight.
That's when Kevin was at his worst.

638
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,724
There were times
where he couldn't even speak.

639
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:52,131
And there were times
where he wouldn't stop speaking.

640
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:57,105
I was hallucinating,
and I had made the assumption...

641
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,977
...that there were bugs in my bed.

642
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:05,447
And they were like stuff that were
giving me AIDS and stuff like that.

643
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:09,007
And I was just
completely off the wall.

644
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:14,047
I hadn't been sexually active
for years, yet I thought I had AIDS.

645
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,318
And it was like...

646
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,325
It was all in my head.

647
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:22,232
I sprayed my bed sheets
with a disinfectant,

648
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:25,028
like a deodorizer
or something like that.

649
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,831
But I sprayed my bed sheets,
you know, I sleep in that.

650
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,565
I inhaled it all night long,

651
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:32,506
which caused the hallucinations
to become greater and greater.

652
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:36,841
And so I got up out of my bed,
sat at my desk,

653
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,374
and I wrote about...

654
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:42,441
I must have written
5 versions of my suicide letter

655
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:45,385
until I realized, "These are mean.
I can't write them like this."

656
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,478
So I wrote a real nice one.

657
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,526
Or so my thought was nice. I mean,
it's a suicide letter, you know.

658
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:54,292
I guess it said something like,

659
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:58,432
"Mom, you're not always right,
don't think you are, but I love you.

660
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,732
Dad, stop being so mean.
You're hurting people."

661
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:03,635
He had a terrible episode.

662
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:10,737
And there was no comment
with regard to suicide.

663
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:15,978
It was a commentary
with regard to hearing voices

664
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:22,321
and difficulty remaining
under control.

665
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:27,659
And I called his psychiatrist
the Sunday night prior,

666
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:31,459
and had a conversation with him,
and the psychiatrist told me,

667
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:35,629
"No, don't worry about it.
Everything is going to be fine."

668
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,365
Kevin and I stayed up,
and we chatted about it.

669
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:43,276
And he seemed to be fine,
almost completely calmed.

670
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,439
Our conversations go like this
when he's mad at me.

671
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:50,543
He tells me to sit down in my chair,
and he basically yells at me.

672
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,316
So, I...

673
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,493
I told him that I don't want to...
What did I say?

674
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:02,861
I said, "I don't want to hurt anybody
anymore. I have to go away."

675
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,331
Or something like that.

676
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:07,597
And he said, "You have an obligation
to stay here for your family.

677
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:10,537
You have an obligation to me,
who's raised you,

678
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,902
given you everything you want.

679
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,273
You have an obligation to live
for your brother, your sister."

680
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,743
But he was mad the whole time.

681
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,781
So I said, "All right, I'm not going
to do anything, Dad. Don't worry."

682
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:21,783
And he was like, "Do I have to take
you to the hospital?" Stuff like that.

683
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,319
I was like, "No, no, no.
It's all right, it's all right."

684
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:25,410
I said, "Let me just sleep on it,

685
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,955
and we'll talk about it
in the morning, okay?

686
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,388
I'm really tired, Dad.
I'm really tired."

687
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,287
So, uh...

688
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,028
He woke me up the next morning
about 7:00,

689
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,189
so I got maybe like 2 hours of sleep.

690
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,357
And he woke me up, and he said,

691
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:39,901
"Hey, you are coming
to work with me."

692
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:40,935
I was like, "No."

693
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,165
He said, "No, come on.
I'm worried about you.

694
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,672
I'm really worried about you."

695
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:45,833
I said, "Dad, I'm fine."

696
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,910
The entire time,
lying through my teeth

697
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:50,343
because I knew I was going
to go to the bridge and jump.

698
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,887
I said, "Listen,
why don't I take the day off,

699
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,387
and we'll go do something?"

700
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,049
And then he said,
"Nope. I'd rather go to school."

701
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,891
I kissed him good-bye
on the cheek, and I was like,

702
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:10,455
"All right, this is the last time I'm
ever going to kiss my dad good-bye.

703
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:14,003
I'll never see him again.
And he'll never see me."

704
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:18,363
And I went to my English class,
dropped all my other classes.

705
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,911
I took the K out to the 28,
to the 29 out to the bridge.

706
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:25,346
And the whole time
I was just bawling my eyes out.

707
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:26,973
Just crying.

708
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,049
Talking to myself on the bus.

709
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,752
Before I got on the 28,
I had stopped at Walgreens,

710
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,588
and I bought my last meal.

711
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:41,289
Starbursts and Skittles.

712
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:44,162
And...

713
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:46,795
Went out to the bridge.

714
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,296
Found a place that I thought,

715
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,875
"All right, not too close
to the pillar. I won't hit the pillar.

716
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,000
I'll just hit the water.

717
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,806
I'll either drown,
or I'll die on impact.

718
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,743
Or I'll have a heart attack.

719
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:04,079
So, I got there. Stood there
for, like, 40 minutes at that spot.

720
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,018
Just crying my eyes out.

721
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,717
Joggers, bikers, runners,
tourists, whatever.

722
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:11,521
Running by, walking by,
looking at me.

723
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,186
Didn't say anything.

724
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,288
And it's not their part.
It's not their problem, but, anyway.

725
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:20,961
And this woman, she came up to me,
and she said, in a German accent...

726
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:25,201
I think it was a German accent,
she said, "Will you take my picture?"

727
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:29,300
I was like, "Your picture?
Woman, I'm going to kill myself.

728
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,403
What are you...?
What is wrong with you?

729
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:33,449
Can't you see the tears
pouring down of my face?"

730
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,314
But she couldn't.
She was on her own hype.

731
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,649
So I took the camera,
took her picture.

732
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,916
Said, "Miss, have a nice day."

733
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,093
Turned back to the traffic,
turned to the bay.

734
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:47,357
And said, "Fuck it, nobody cares."
Pardon my French.

735
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:49,659
And I hurled over the bridge.

736
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:13,656
See, what most people do, apparently,
is they get on the ledge

737
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:15,350
outside of the bridge,
and they stand there.

738
00:53:15,459 --> 00:53:18,292
And people can talk them out of it
or pull them up or whatever.

739
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,694
I didn't want anybody
to talk me out of it.

740
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,493
I just wanted to die.

741
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,128
So I hurdled over the railing with
my hands, and I was falling headfirst.

742
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:32,232
And the second my hands left the bar,
or the railing,

743
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:33,935
I said, "I don't want to die."

744
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:35,239
I said, "What am I going to do?

745
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:37,541
This is like...
This is it, I'm dead."

746
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:41,843
So I said,
"Well, maybe if I get feet first.

747
00:53:41,953 --> 00:53:43,887
Maybe, maybe I'll live."

748
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:45,250
So I thought...

749
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:49,119
"All right, it's worth a shot."

750
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:52,526
So my head was falling like this,
and I pushed myself back somehow,

751
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,030
and I landed literally
like I was sitting down.

752
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:58,932
Kind of, like, maybe a little more
elevated with the legs.

753
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,261
And I hit with my feet.

754
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,167
And I guess the water treaded
through my boots a little bit,

755
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:07,073
so maybe helped the impact.

756
00:54:07,178 --> 00:54:09,112
And the boots are pretty tough, so...

757
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,473
And I went down about,
I'd say, 50, 40, 40 or 50 feet.

758
00:54:15,152 --> 00:54:16,949
Didn't know which way
was up or down.

759
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:19,522
I'm thinking, "Am I still alive?"

760
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:22,525
Because it's like
a 4 to 7-second fall.

761
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:26,395
It's like 120 miles per hour.

762
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:27,857
It's like...

763
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:31,230
I think that's like
7 seconds below terminal velocity

764
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:35,465
or like the velocity that the
down-slope skiers get, you know.

765
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:41,803
I was awake. I was alive.

766
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,838
I was swimming my butt off to get
somewhere where there was air.

767
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:50,684
So I reached the surface, I guess,
because I saw some sort of light.

768
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:53,218
And I was screaming for help,
and I couldn't really scream,

769
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:54,882
my voice was gone.
I couldn't...

770
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:58,792
I couldn't yell.
I was like, "Help. Help me."

771
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:04,997
And I felt something brush by my leg.

772
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:07,332
I was like, "Oh, great!

773
00:55:07,438 --> 00:55:09,770
I didn't die jumping off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

774
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:11,603
A shark is going to eat me."

775
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:13,870
I was like, "This is ridiculous!"

776
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:15,979
Years later I found out,

777
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,015
as a matter of fact, last year
I found out it wasn't a shark.

778
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:20,413
It was a seal circling me,

779
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:23,851
and apparently it was the only thing
keeping me afloat.

780
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:27,582
And you cannot tell me
that wasn't God,

781
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:29,125
because that's what I believe.

782
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:32,559
And that's what I'll believe
until the day I die.

783
00:55:54,018 --> 00:56:01,151
I'm sitting in my office,
and the secretary said,

784
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:05,194
"There's someone on the line for you
from Marin General Hospital."

785
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:11,730
So I picked up the phone,
and a woman said, "Is this Pat Hines?"

786
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:12,962
And I said, "Yes."

787
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:18,269
She said, "Your son has just jumped
from the Golden Gate Bridge."

788
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:20,772
I've lived here all my life.

789
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:23,444
I know what that means.

790
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:26,975
And I said, "Is he alive?"

791
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:30,085
And she said, "Oh, yes."

792
00:56:30,254 --> 00:56:31,915
And I thought...

793
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:36,583
...that they probably told me
that just to keep me calm

794
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:43,566
so that I wouldn't wreck my car
driving over to see his mangled body.

795
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:14,194
I shattered my T-12 and my L-1,
which is my lower lumbar region,

796
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:20,203
into very, very tiny little pieces,
and the pieces went into my organs.

797
00:57:20,538 --> 00:57:22,165
But they missed my heart.

798
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:25,265
At this point in time, I mean,
I still thought he would be dead.

799
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:30,473
So I went up to this gurney, and I
looked down, and he was wide awake.

800
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:34,881
And he looked up at me,
and he said, "I'm sorry."

801
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:38,287
And then he just
closed his eyes, and...

802
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:41,351
I just stood there staring at him

803
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:43,893
and he was, by that point in time,
in a coma.

804
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:47,961
It was just super scary, you know.

805
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:50,966
I mean, I can't...
I can't explain it.

806
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:55,063
To feel it would be like...

807
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:00,106
Like feeling an alien jumping
out of your body or something.

808
00:58:00,211 --> 00:58:01,940
Like your soul or whatever.

809
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:08,747
It was ridiculous. Scary.
Just really wild.

810
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:26,459
2004 was a tough year for Kevin.

811
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:28,265
It hasn't been a cakewalk.

812
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:32,866
Kevin's been visited
by extreme mental illness

813
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:37,004
3 times subsequent
to his jump off the bridge.

814
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:41,517
The most recent, he was confined
for almost 3 months

815
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:45,111
while he struggled,
and his doctor's struggled,

816
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:48,658
to get his bipolar bracketed in.

817
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:53,325
And it's a matter of diet.
It's a matter of consistency.

818
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:56,422
And it's a matter
of proper drug therapy.

819
00:58:56,967 --> 00:59:02,234
Kevin will begin to make headway.

820
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:03,806
His life will gain traction,

821
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:07,071
and then he begins to get
outside of the brackets

822
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:09,372
into which he can function.

823
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:15,385
And unfortunately,
it has taken 3 times now outside,

824
00:59:15,486 --> 00:59:18,353
in those outside areas
to convince him,

825
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:22,721
prove to him, more importantly,
that he can't go there.

826
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:27,558
Unfortunately for Kevin, it's get up
at 8:00 in the morning,

827
00:59:27,665 --> 00:59:32,398
take your pills at 8:00,
have lunch at noon, if you will,

828
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:37,702
dinner at 6:00,
pills at 9:00, bed at 10:00.

829
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:40,242
And that's a very,
very difficult existence

830
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:44,371
for a 24-year-old male
in this society.

831
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:54,388
But I've told him,

832
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:58,052
"It's a wonderful disease to have,
Kev, because you can control it.

833
00:59:58,162 --> 01:00:01,996
If you had cancer, you wouldn't have
the same opportunity.

834
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,430
Unlike cancer, Kevin,

835
01:00:03,534 --> 01:00:06,230
as long as you stay
within these bands, you've got it.

836
01:00:06,337 --> 01:00:07,634
It doesn't have you."

837
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:11,105
It's funny, my family members still
think I haven't learned my lesson.

838
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,540
But the lesson was learned
a long time ago.

839
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:16,808
And, you know...

840
01:00:18,749 --> 01:00:23,118
It's hard when you keep messing up,

841
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:28,956
and no one in your family believes
in you anymore or trusts you.

842
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:31,822
Or they're scared
you're going to go attempt again.

843
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:35,922
And they're always worried. Walking
on eggshells when they talk to you.

844
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:39,268
It sucks.
So I'm tired of that.

845
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:43,204
I just want them to say,
"Hey, Kev, what's cracking, man?"

846
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:49,070
Just be real about it.
Don't walk on eggshells around me.

847
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:51,306
I'm the same...
I'm the same guy.

848
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:55,784
Just a different soul, you know?

849
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:58,013
Different ideals.

850
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:08,420
I just want to be normal again.

851
01:01:08,532 --> 01:01:10,796
But I never will be.

852
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:53,002
We started using crystal meth,
and, you know...

853
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,771
Using crystal just...

854
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,847
Everything started
going down the toilet.

855
01:01:57,948 --> 01:02:00,678
She lost her job.
I lost my job.

856
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:03,344
We ended up becoming homeless.

857
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:10,383
She has a little easier time
letting go of drugs than I do.

858
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:12,689
I have a very addictive personality.

859
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:21,066
I just found out last week
that she's been cheating on me again.

860
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:30,504
So, I picked up my son, and I gave him
a hug and a kiss and said good-bye.

861
01:02:30,614 --> 01:02:32,707
And told her to F-off.

862
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:38,750
And then I found myself just walking
toward the Golden Gate Bridge.

863
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:43,084
I was crying the whole way, you know.

864
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,453
The only thing I kept saying was...

865
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:47,257
You know...

866
01:02:47,698 --> 01:02:50,792
"As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

867
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:54,302
I shall not fear a thing,
because God's with me."

868
01:02:57,374 --> 01:03:00,571
So, when I got to the halfway point
of the bridge, I set my book down,

869
01:03:00,677 --> 01:03:03,874
and I jumped over onto the railing.

870
01:03:08,085 --> 01:03:12,283
And I just sat there, you know,
crying and thinking for a little bit.

871
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:14,414
And the cops showed up.

872
01:03:14,992 --> 01:03:18,985
I made the mistake of letting them
get to know me too well,

873
01:03:19,096 --> 01:03:23,157
because they completely
used my son against me.

874
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:33,365
Actually, I came
to the bridge last year at this time

875
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:35,001
to do the same thing.

876
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:37,137
So it's not a new idea,

877
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:42,207
but kind of one that became
a little obsessive, I suppose.

878
01:03:45,556 --> 01:03:46,887
I literally got here...

879
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:51,654
Today I was on an airplane
from Houston, Texas.

880
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:55,654
What drew me to it, in spite of having
to do so much preparations,

881
01:03:55,766 --> 01:03:59,497
is that it is so accessible.

882
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:01,833
You just kind of hop over.

883
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:05,136
Yeah, letting go,
that's the tough part.

884
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:15,848
I don't know if people think
about that a lot, like, the process

885
01:04:15,953 --> 01:04:19,821
that a person goes through in trying
to decide how to end their life.

886
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:23,654
It's like a search. It's like looking
for a college to attend or something.

887
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,093
You know, the pros and cons,
and it's a destructive act,

888
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,757
but there's a lot of rational thought
that goes into an act

889
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:33,496
that a lot of people
just consider irrational.

890
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:39,098
In my bag,
I had my parents' phone number,

891
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,608
and I wanted them to know
what happened

892
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:44,203
and not just be agonizing over
what happened to their daughter

893
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:46,043
for a week or two.

894
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,918
So I wanted people
to see me actually do it.

895
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:53,353
And I think I really did want
somebody to say, "No, don't do it."

896
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:14,135
When Gene called me
from St. Louis in despair

897
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:16,644
and was going to jump off
the bridge there,

898
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:21,241
he said, "I'm just calling
to say good-bye. It's time."

899
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:22,817
What could I say to him?

900
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:27,347
You know, I had tried on occasion

901
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:31,325
to find something
that would encourage him to live.

902
01:05:31,962 --> 01:05:33,554
Something.

903
01:05:33,964 --> 01:05:36,956
And I asked him again for a favor.

904
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:40,867
I said, "Put my name
and phone number in a plastic bag

905
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:42,563
in your pocket,

906
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:47,440
so that when you are found,
I can be told.

907
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:49,535
I need to know."

908
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:56,876
He had called me
from a bridge back there.

909
01:05:56,987 --> 01:05:59,114
But he called me first,
from the train tracks,

910
01:05:59,222 --> 01:06:01,918
saying he was going to lay his neck
across the train tracks.

911
01:06:02,025 --> 01:06:04,960
And because he said
things like that all the time...

912
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:07,360
...I didn't call him back.
- Yeah.

913
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:09,864
Because I just didn't want to hear it.

914
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:13,334
You know, you can only hear
the same thing so many times

915
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:15,268
and give the same answer
so many times.

916
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:18,205
You know, "Stop being stupid.
Don't be ridiculous."

917
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:22,642
It gets tiring after a while.
You want to hear something different.

918
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:25,738
So I guess when I didn't call him
back, he went to the bridge.

919
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:27,976
Yeah, he had made
his way to a bridge.

920
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:29,518
He called me on my cell phone.

921
01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:33,783
He told me this relationship that
he was pursuing is all falling apart.

922
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:36,757
So I kept him on the phone.
And I was talking to him.

923
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:40,694
At one point in our conversation,
he said, "Oh, a cop's driving by."

924
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:43,265
And I actually heard
the cop stop and ask him,

925
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:45,767
"Hey, you're not going to jump,
are you?"

926
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:49,134
They asked him, "Is everything okay?
Any problems?"

927
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:52,731
And he's like, "No, not really."

928
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:56,073
You know, they decided
to leave him alone.

929
01:06:56,179 --> 01:07:00,081
And that's when I said, "Look,
I'm going to get a ticket for you,

930
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:02,845
for the bus, and you're going
to come back to California."

931
01:07:02,953 --> 01:07:05,922
And I convinced him to do that.

932
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:45,389
David is very dramatic.
Boisterous. A life-of-the-party type.

933
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:48,089
Playing the piano. Singing.

934
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:49,528
You know, really Mr. Party.

935
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:53,124
Which is very interesting,
because I'm not that way at all.

936
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:55,500
And I think part of the reason
he liked me

937
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:57,436
was that I didn't ask him to do that,

938
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:01,374
or he didn't feel he had to do that
around me.

939
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:07,373
He was a handsome guy.
He was a good dresser.

940
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,110
And he just exuded this...

941
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:12,119
Which is another reason
why I guess it's so...

942
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:17,592
...shocking to me, is that
he just exuded this joy for life.

943
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:31,705
Ruby was someone
that I was always proud to pull in.

944
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,740
So when there was
somebody new in my life,

945
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:37,006
or I was dating somebody for a while,
I'd want to bring him over, you know?

946
01:08:42,385 --> 01:08:44,080
One of Jim's favorite things was,

947
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:46,485
when he'd see me, he'd say,
"Oh, I met a new friend.

948
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:49,752
You've got to meet this person.
You've just got to meet this person."

949
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:52,623
He had great delight
in bringing people together.

950
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:55,721
He really loved people in a...

951
01:08:57,834 --> 01:09:00,234
Just a very warm personality.

952
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:05,666
At least that's how he was
in the beginning.

953
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:22,013
Before 6 months ago,
I would never have said that I thought

954
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:26,027
Ruby had a significant
depression problem.

955
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:30,732
I know that he was alone,
without a source of income.

956
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,529
I know his sister had killed herself.

957
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:36,503
I know he had all those variables.

958
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,941
Nothing before
this last few months of his life

959
01:09:40,043 --> 01:09:42,568
indicated to me
that he was out of the range

960
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:48,082
of the normal ups and downs
that we just don't share all the time.

961
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:52,721
David came over to Charlie's
to have dinner with us.

962
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:55,222
And that's when he told us,
for the first time,

963
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:57,155
he was seriously on medication.

964
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,421
But up until that point...

965
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:02,828
Apparently he had been
self-medicating with alcohol.

966
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:05,298
And although I knew him for 9 years...

967
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:10,497
...I could count on maybe...

968
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,732
Maybe 2 times
did I see him really drunk.

969
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,574
David would, every so often,

970
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,672
determine that he
had to get his life back together,

971
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:25,777
or he would be confronted by me
or other friends and start treatment.

972
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,516
He took antidepressants
for a month and a half or so

973
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,182
and made a big show of it.

974
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:33,694
But then, in the end, I arranged
the labels so that I could see

975
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:37,357
if he'd been picking the bottles up,
and he hadn't touched them.

976
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,264
Didn't touch them for weeks.

977
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,132
So a couple of months
before he died,

978
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,175
Ruby started talking about...

979
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:50,302
He couldn't get over
his feelings of losses,

980
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:53,780
and he thought
that he might be depressed.

981
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:56,647
But he didn't have
any health insurance.

982
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,385
So he said, "I want some meds.

983
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,924
Got any ideas
about how I can get some?"

984
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,926
And I had tried
some antidepressant meds.

985
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:09,429
They didn't seem to help,
and I couldn't sleep on them.

986
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:12,158
So I said, "Okay, listen.

987
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:17,471
Here.

988
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:21,874
You can have mine.

989
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:27,513
But you've got to call a physician
for information on how to take them.

990
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:32,077
You know, I cannot be responsible
for how you take them.

991
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:34,247
But you can have them."

992
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:36,520
So...

993
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:40,994
I was going to give him
the whole bottle of them.

994
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:44,157
The original bottle, and I thought,

995
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:49,237
"What if one day somebody
goes into his apartment

996
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:56,972
and is looking through his stuff
and, you know, finds my name

997
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:59,504
on a bottle of meds?"

998
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:03,275
I took them out,
and I put them in an envelope.

999
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,486
Just a plain envelope.

1000
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:14,996
It was around November,

1001
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:18,760
or the fall, when Jim lost
an enormous amount of money.

1002
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:24,238
And he actually made the statement,
"Well, if I don't sell these pots,"

1003
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,399
which were these Japanese ceramics,

1004
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,500
"I'm just going to have
to commit hara-kiri."

1005
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:36,815
When I called him, I said,
"David, I know you're in trouble.

1006
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:39,979
I know you've lost your job,
and I want to help you."

1007
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:43,286
He stopped, because I'd never
really said that before.

1008
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:46,054
Because I didn't view him
as really in trouble.

1009
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:48,494
And he said,

1010
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:50,122
"I can't talk about this right now,

1011
01:12:50,233 --> 01:12:52,463
because I don't want to cry
in the middle of the street."

1012
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:55,469
And I thought, "Oh, my God.
You know, this is serious.

1013
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:59,029
He's really emotionally
on the verge of tears."

1014
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:04,174
5 months before he jumped,

1015
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:09,814
he had written a note, an e-mail,
to a couple dozen of his friends,

1016
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:13,047
saying that he
had been contemplating suicide.

1017
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:16,147
And a lot of them wrote back to him
and called him and...

1018
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:19,886
However, he never
mentioned suicide to me, ever.

1019
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:23,124
And I just can't fathom the idea
of committing suicide.

1020
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,633
And I just think I thought that he was
one of those people who...

1021
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:30,695
For him, it just wasn't an option,
but apparently it was.

1022
01:13:46,322 --> 01:13:48,017
My daughter was leaving for camp,

1023
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:51,616
and I said, "You know what?
Let's go to the movies."

1024
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,487
We went into the theater.

1025
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:00,898
And he just...

1026
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:04,339
He just put his hands...

1027
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,607
His head in his hands, and he just...

1028
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:10,136
...wept.

1029
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,975
He just wept in the movie.

1030
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:16,946
And I was tearing up a little, too.

1031
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:20,887
But he was just crying
and crying and crying.

1032
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,318
And...

1033
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:31,423
And he put his hand on my leg.

1034
01:14:33,536 --> 01:14:37,529
And I said,
"Ruby, I don't need to be comforted."

1035
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,241
And he looked at me.

1036
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:47,349
And I thought,
"Oh, my God! Oh, no!"

1037
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:54,050
And I just... At that...

1038
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:57,091
You know, it was then
that I remembered...

1039
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,991
...that I put the meds
in a plain white envelope...

1040
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:04,923
...a couple months earlier.

1041
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:07,299
So...

1042
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:14,873
We got out of the movie theater,
and we were walking to his car.

1043
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:17,374
And I thought,

1044
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:22,114
"He's not just depressed.
He wants to kill himself."

1045
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:37,528
And he said, "The meds, I think
I can't sleep because of the meds."

1046
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,396
And I said,

1047
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:41,629
"I know. I wish
I hadn't given them to you

1048
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:45,764
because I feel like I made it worse.

1049
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:48,736
They had the same effect on me."

1050
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:52,603
He said, "That's it, actually.
I can't sleep.

1051
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:55,376
And I'm just up.

1052
01:15:55,785 --> 01:16:00,188
I can't stop worrying.

1053
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:06,292
I just can't turn it off. And not
sleeping is what is making me crazy.

1054
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:09,587
I'm thinking about killing myself."

1055
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:12,333
And I said, "I know."

1056
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:17,831
You know, I felt it
when we were walking to the car.

1057
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,204
Like something was gone.

1058
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:24,410
And he said, "I'm so ashamed

1059
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:27,482
to tell you that I'm thinking
about doing this.

1060
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,279
What would you think of me if I did?"

1061
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:37,447
And I said, "Ruby, I have understood

1062
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,394
that there are people
who have incessant pain.

1063
01:16:41,664 --> 01:16:43,291
But...

1064
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,394
I don't think you are one of them.

1065
01:16:48,037 --> 01:16:50,267
Do you have a plan?"

1066
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,234
And he said, "Well, I'm thinking
about different things.

1067
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:56,368
I'd overdose, except I'm not sure
how much to take,

1068
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:00,040
and I might wake up in an ER,
and that would be horrible."

1069
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:04,482
And, "I thought about the bridge."

1070
01:17:04,587 --> 01:17:08,079
And I said, "You can't do the bridge.
Too dramatic."

1071
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:09,882
He said, "What about people
who shoot themselves?"

1072
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:13,359
And I said, "It's too messy.
It's not fair to your landlord.

1073
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:16,693
And, anyway, you know,

1074
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:21,168
you are not in the category
of people who get to kill themselves."

1075
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,999
And then he wanted to come over
and spend some time

1076
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,805
and just didn't want to go home yet.

1077
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:31,880
But I actually just...

1078
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,211
I wanted to be by myself.

1079
01:17:35,184 --> 01:17:39,211
I said, "No. Can't.

1080
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:46,488
But if you feel really desperate,
you call me, I'll drop anything."

1081
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:48,324
I did say that.

1082
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:55,393
So then I got him out of my car
and went home.

1083
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:58,473
And I didn't hear from him...

1084
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,833
Actually, ever again.

1085
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:58,756
We all know how much,
all of us who've been close to Jim,

1086
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:02,495
how his passing has affected us,
whether it's...

1087
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,039
...fear that...

1088
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:08,769
...you know,
you might get to that same place

1089
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,538
and do the same thing, or...

1090
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:16,173
...just guilt because you felt
you weren't a good enough friend.

1091
01:19:16,285 --> 01:19:18,253
Or, whatever it is, there...

1092
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:20,589
...there is a lot
of different reactions.

1093
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:24,147
Talking to everybody,
there is a lot of different reactions.

1094
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:28,989
And I think everyone is trying
to make sense of it, and...

1095
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:30,725
...as one...

1096
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:35,461
...in Jim's particular passing,
which as a friend of mine said,

1097
01:19:35,571 --> 01:19:40,338
"He was warning you,
but he was not asking for help."

1098
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:50,413
I thought that he was probably
feeling so ashamed,

1099
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:52,009
because the theme of that night was,

1100
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:54,248
"I'm so ashamed
I'm telling you this"...

1101
01:19:54,356 --> 01:20:02,161
...that I made the mistake
of giving him some space to recover.

1102
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:06,230
And that was a bad call, I think.

1103
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:10,261
You know, I could have 51-50'd him.

1104
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:16,503
But also,
I didn't want to humiliate him

1105
01:20:16,612 --> 01:20:18,580
and have him be in a psych facility...

1106
01:20:18,681 --> 01:20:20,706
...because I wasn't sure
they were really going to help him,

1107
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:23,284
and I didn't want
to cross my boundaries.

1108
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:29,187
But I will never again not intrude.
I won't respect their privacy.

1109
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:31,555
And their...
And I will not ever again...

1110
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:36,826
...not do something because I'm afraid
that they might be embarrassed.

1111
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:44,172
There's obviously,
a fuzzy line between doing nothing

1112
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:46,434
and doing what
would have prevented it.

1113
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:48,942
And who knows where that line is?

1114
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:50,610
He was a grownup.

1115
01:20:50,713 --> 01:20:52,806
I couldn't tell him
what to do with his life.

1116
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:56,783
And I suppose if we had him
locked up, or something, then...

1117
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,579
...he might still be alive, but...

1118
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:04,084
I don't blame myself like that.

1119
01:21:05,428 --> 01:21:08,363
Initially,
several of his other friends

1120
01:21:08,931 --> 01:21:10,796
went out there as a group,

1121
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,993
because they knew
the light pole number

1122
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:17,334
where he had jumped.

1123
01:21:18,674 --> 01:21:20,471
I couldn't go.

1124
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:24,306
But a couple of months later,
I did go, and it was very difficult.

1125
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:28,778
And I'll never be able to sort of
drive across bridge again without...

1126
01:21:29,452 --> 01:21:30,851
...some kind of...

1127
01:21:31,988 --> 01:21:34,115
...emotional reaction.

1128
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:37,923
Something else
I'm pissed off at him about.

1129
01:21:38,027 --> 01:21:39,824
Such a great bridge.

1130
01:21:43,032 --> 01:21:45,523
I think the bridge has a romance.

1131
01:21:45,835 --> 01:21:48,861
A false, you know, a false promise.

1132
01:21:48,971 --> 01:21:51,599
A false romantic promise to it.

1133
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:55,104
Because he's dead...

1134
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:02,707
...and he doesn't get to benefit
from the romantic,

1135
01:22:02,818 --> 01:22:06,652
from the romanticism of it,
he doesn't have any benefit from it.

1136
01:22:06,856 --> 01:22:11,691
It romanticizes him,
a bit in the legend...

1137
01:22:15,798 --> 01:22:17,925
...but he doesn't benefit from it.

1138
01:22:18,034 --> 01:22:20,594
So what if his story
has that at the end?

1139
01:22:20,703 --> 01:22:22,398
He's gone.

1140
01:22:23,973 --> 01:22:25,907
And so I think
there's an empty promise.

1141
01:22:26,008 --> 01:22:27,942
It's almost like when alcoholics talk

1142
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:30,740
about the romance of the bottle,
you know?

1143
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:35,678
Like, maybe the first sip is really
good, and everything else is hell.

1144
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:41,153
So maybe walking out there he had a
romantic moment, or two, or an hour.

1145
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:44,922
But hitting the water can't be fun.

1146
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:50,397
And so I think he felt like a failure,
and this was some sort of redemption.

1147
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:57,504
I think that it just drew him
with this idea of, you know,

1148
01:22:57,606 --> 01:23:02,009
sort of being famous.

1149
01:23:47,656 --> 01:23:52,355
The last time I saw him,
I was leaving for work.

1150
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:56,992
I gave him 5 bucks, so he could get
a pack of smokes, go grab a paper,

1151
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:01,261
you know, go out and maybe
hit a couple of places

1152
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:03,338
to put in some applications.

1153
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:05,566
And that's when he disappeared.

1154
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:08,575
I was the last one
to actually talk to him.

1155
01:24:09,178 --> 01:24:12,045
And I remember while
I was walking out the door,

1156
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:17,685
the last thing I said was,
"Cheer up, Gene."

1157
01:24:17,787 --> 01:24:20,415
I said, "Everything will work out."

1158
01:24:20,523 --> 01:24:22,184
You know, and...

1159
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:24,487
Just jokingly I said,

1160
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,121
"See you when I get home.
Love you."

1161
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:30,765
That was it. That was the last thing
I ever said to him.

1162
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:33,499
The last thing
I ever said to him was a fight.

1163
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:34,762
Yeah.

1164
01:24:35,604 --> 01:24:38,232
Because he wasn't...

1165
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:42,367
I didn't think that he was trying
to find a job as hard as he could.

1166
01:24:42,812 --> 01:24:44,211
And it was making me angry

1167
01:24:44,313 --> 01:24:47,646
because I knew that he was
very smart, and he was very capable.

1168
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:50,150
And the only thing
holding him back was him...

1169
01:24:50,352 --> 01:24:52,217
...just not caring.

1170
01:24:52,354 --> 01:24:54,549
And he had found
one of the kids' sidewalk chalk,

1171
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:58,388
and he was sitting
behind Matt's truck,

1172
01:24:58,494 --> 01:25:01,054
and he wrote "End me"
on the ground.

1173
01:25:01,163 --> 01:25:03,893
Like, he scratched it in
over and over and over.

1174
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:05,796
And my son came and got me.

1175
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:08,335
And said,
"Why would Gene write that?"

1176
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:19,403
Knowing Gene, and the way
his personality works, and stuff,

1177
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:21,915
the Golden Gate Bridge
was perfect for him

1178
01:25:22,017 --> 01:25:26,852
because it's just one easy step,
and there's no turning back.

1179
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:31,450
In hindsight, I almost feel
like it was meant to happen.

1180
01:25:31,594 --> 01:25:33,118
Maybe he's happy now.

1181
01:25:33,362 --> 01:25:35,159
You know, who knows?
I don't.

1182
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,968
I know, I know he was...

1183
01:25:40,903 --> 01:25:44,896
He couldn't have lasted much longer.
Not the way he was going.

1184
01:25:45,441 --> 01:25:47,409
But if he would have waited,

1185
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,501
there was a message
on our answering machine

1186
01:25:49,612 --> 01:25:51,773
from one of the places in Oakland,

1187
01:25:51,881 --> 01:25:55,146
that had offered him a management
position, which is what he wanted.

1188
01:25:55,251 --> 01:25:57,549
They were opening a new...
Game Stop?

1189
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:58,813
- I think it was.
- Yeah, whatever.

1190
01:25:58,921 --> 01:26:00,388
One of the game stores.

1191
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:02,821
And they were going to put him
straight into management.

1192
01:26:02,925 --> 01:26:04,552
And he had an interview,
the day that he jumped,

1193
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,321
at 10:00 in the morning.

1194
01:26:06,462 --> 01:26:08,828
And I don't know
if he got the message

1195
01:26:08,931 --> 01:26:12,423
or if he missed it, because
I don't know what time he left.

1196
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:14,833
He was gone before I got home.

1197
01:26:15,137 --> 01:26:19,836
So, if he would have been there
to check the message, or waited...

1198
01:26:27,316 --> 01:26:32,413
I couldn't fully cry,
and I couldn't fully, whatever,

1199
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:35,684
but the overwhelming emotion
was anger.

1200
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:39,420
You know, I was extremely pissed.

1201
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:45,626
I wanted to drive out to the Bay Area
and go to the coroner and,

1202
01:26:47,603 --> 01:26:52,563
you know, get... clear,
"Wake up! Why did you do that?"

1203
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:57,877
I don't see any reason
for people to do that.

1204
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:04,080
And Gene had people
in this world that loved him.

1205
01:27:04,787 --> 01:27:07,620
And he hurt them.

1206
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:12,383
If I see him again,
that's what I want to tell him.

1207
01:27:12,494 --> 01:27:13,688
He hurt me.

1208
01:27:13,796 --> 01:27:16,492
And I didn't think
he would ever do that.

1209
01:27:23,305 --> 01:27:26,741
"Disturbed" is an interesting word,
because it...

1210
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:30,807
That's all I can define it as,
as I was disturbed.

1211
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:33,211
Now I miss him. Now I'm sad.

1212
01:27:33,315 --> 01:27:38,048
But at the moment,
there was almost...

1213
01:27:39,388 --> 01:27:44,485
That I got the news,
there was almost a sense of relief.

1214
01:27:48,063 --> 01:27:55,231
That he wasn't going to be
disappointed or unhappy anymore.

1215
01:27:57,573 --> 01:27:59,473
I miss him.

1216
01:27:59,742 --> 01:28:01,141
But...

1217
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:04,644
...I don't have any answers.

1218
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:08,783
Just a bunch of observations

1219
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:14,845
and a bunch of experience
of feeling disturbed

1220
01:28:15,491 --> 01:28:18,187
about that situation.

1221
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,290
I don't know
why people kill themselves.

1222
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:25,828
And yet,
it's a small step to empathize.

1223
01:28:25,934 --> 01:28:26,992
To say...

1224
01:28:28,037 --> 01:28:31,302
Because I think we all experience
moments of despair,

1225
01:28:31,407 --> 01:28:37,073
that it would just be so much easier
not to do this anymore.

1226
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:42,474
But for most of us,
the sun comes out, and then,

1227
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:46,987
"Oh, well, tomorrow is another day."

1228
01:28:55,531 --> 01:28:59,490
Why he chose the bridge?
I don't know.

1229
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:04,438
Maybe there is
a certain amount of release

1230
01:29:04,606 --> 01:29:08,337
from pain by pain.

1231
01:29:11,547 --> 01:29:14,141
Maybe he just wanted to fly
one time.
