00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,703
Look him up. Give him a call.

180
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,491
Who wants to see a more pork, hey?

181
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,157
Oh, isn't he gorgeous?

182
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,413
MAN: Putangitangi,

183
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,121
the paradise shelduck,

184
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,828
is endemic to New Zealand.

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,740
It can be found
nowhere else in the world.

186
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:54,034
When discovered by Captain Cook,
he called it the painted duck,

187
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,948
an inadequate description, I feel.

188
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,448
You know a lot about ducks.

189
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,365
Thank you, Ginger.

190
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:04,909
Actually, they have more in common
with swans and geese

191
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,493
than they do with ducks.

192
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:11,457
I'm a, uh, vet by trade
but a twitcher by volition.

193
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,489
A twitcher?

194
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:13,907
Birdwatcher.
Oh.

195
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,619
I've always loved birds.

196
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,828
They do something that we...

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,365
...humans can't do.

198
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:22,158
They... fly unaided.

199
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:26,372
Rather magical animals,
as far as I'm concerned.

200
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,124
(QUACKS)

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,865
Well, let's have a look.

202
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,081
Yes, he has been shot.

203
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,868
No sign of a female friend
when you found him?

204
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:41,782
No.

205
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,823
Many people believe
that they mate for life,

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,072
so that if they lose a mate,
then that's it.

207
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,956
(WHISPERS) He's on his own.

208
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,495
Your friend's flying days are over.
He can't fend for himself.

209
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,864
So I think the most humane thing to do
would be to put him down.

210
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,033
Oh...

211
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,789
Or...

212
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,325
...I could bind his wing and
we could try to find him a foster home.

213
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,910
Well, that sounds good.

214
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,119
Someone will need to
look after him in the meantime.

215
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,499
(QUACKS)

216
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,248
Right.

217
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,614
So, how long?
Couple of days, maybe a week.

218
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:21,657
Hmm?

219
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,414
(QUACKS)

220
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:27,374
Yeah. Alright.

221
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,328
I'll do it. I can do that.

222
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,161
Right, what...
What does he eat?

223
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,995
Well, shelducks
usually graze on seeds and grasses

224
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,408
with the odd worm thrown in.

225
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,448
However, tinned peas will be fine.

226
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,492
Tinned peas?
Mm-hm.

227
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,536
Alright.
Mum, look!

228
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,448
He's strange.

229
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,458
(QUACKS)

230
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,161

I like your duck.
Thank you.

233

Have you had him long?

234
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,540
No, I'm just looking after it
for a while.

(MAKES FLATULENT NOISE)

236
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,248
That was the duck.

237
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,657
Right.

238
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,540

Yeah.

239
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,073
Well, see you later.
'Bye.

240
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,163
It shouldn't take too long.
I should have it all ready to... go!

My God!
Christ on a bike.

242
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,540
I really didn't think
he'd stoop to this.

243
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,415
This is nuts!

244
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,990

Fine!

248
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,745
If he wants to trash my stuff...

249
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:10,748
...I'll bloody show him.

251
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,291
Is it true that penguins
mate once a year?

252
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,119
Yeah.

253
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,993

what you're laughing at.

When was the last time
you got lucky?

257
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,367
Actually, I'm very happy
being a penguin.

258
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,453
You're not a penguin, Holly.

coming back to work today, huh?

No.

00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,082
It all sort of got out of hand.

get rid of the duck. So...

Of course. Yep.

00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,740
I'll see you then.

00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,748
Oh, oh. Hey. Hey,
and bring the duck.

276
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:39,828

than the other two, right?

What did that guy
with the duck want?

00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:04,158
He found it, wanted to know
what to do with it.

282
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,698
He was quite cute.

This pond still isn't
draining properly.

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,536
It needs rooting out, I think.

give it a good seeing-to.

547
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,825
Get it from the old man.
He was quite the fanatic.

548
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,365
Was he?

549
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:33,827

It's alright.

554
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,535
He'd probably like it.

555
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:45,040
Oh, I didn't...
Uh... Well, he's, uh...

556

He's looking... He's looking good.

Um, no.

But he can't understand me.

00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:10,704
He'll probably need
somewhere to swim, though, so...

566
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,947
Yeah. I've got to get him
out of my bath. Yep, uh...

That would be weird.

No.
I wouldn't have a bath with a duck.

Yeah.

00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,115
(LAUGHS)

705
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,699
Doug's gonna come in, and um...

706
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,536
...Gurneesh is just cleaning up,
Yeah.

707
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:14,994
I kind of run the guys.

708
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:16,703
Yep. Cool.

709
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,661
(QUACKS)

710
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:44,905
(LAUGHS) You know, it might be
the first thing Brent's got right.

711
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,869
She is kinda cute.

712
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:48,248
(QUACKS)

713
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,533
Forget it.

714
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,573
I don't think she's got any interest in me.

715
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,038
(QUACKS)
Ow! What was that for?

716
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,369
(QUACKS)
Oi. Where you going?

717
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:01,579
Hey. Where do you think you're going?

718
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,115
Shhh.
Alright, Doug?

719
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:05,374
Hi.
Hi.

720
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,448
Just walking Pierre.

721
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,081
Great.

722
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,911
He seems to like your area.
Does he?

723
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,699
So...

724
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,240
Drain's almost done.

725
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:19,373
Oh, good. Great.

726
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:22,124
It's finished, you'll be...
all fully drained and...

727
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:25,789
Lovely. (LAUGHS)

728
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:28,370
(PIERRE QUACKS)

729
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:31,409
Can I, uh...
help you with anything else?

730
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,700
Yeah, I wanted to say thank you
for helping with Pierre.

731
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:37,161
Oh, no. Not a problem.

732
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,914
It's what I do. (LAUGHS)

733
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,199
I wanted to show my thanks and...

734
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,582
...maybe...

735
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,786
...take you out for... for dinner?

736
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:48,244
Oh... uh...

737
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:52,035
Or we could just,
uh, get a coffee or...

738
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:53,948
Well, yeah. That's, um...

739
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,535
That's really sweet of you.

740
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,323
Go for a walk...
(LAUGHS)

741
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,536
Busy! (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
That's alright. That's cool.

742
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:01,244
Hi, Doug.
Hi.

743
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,822
Holly... I am not gonna be able
to come over for dinner tonight.

744
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,322
I'm sorry. I had to
take the late cleaning shift.

745
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,081
OK.

746
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,660
Um, why doesn't Doug go

747
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,698
instead of me?

748
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,740
Sorry, what?
What?

749
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:20,499
Yeah. You guys both look like
you could use the company.

750
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,658
Well, um...

751
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,290
Happy little penguin, are we?

752
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:33,494
Actually, it'd be really nice.

753
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:35,908
If you're still up for it. (LAUGHS)

754
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:38,369
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah, great.

755
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:40,282
Good. Worked out well.

756
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:43,291
Lovely. Well...
(LAUGHS) See you, then.

757
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,244
See you then... then.
Lovely.

758
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:46,782
(LAUGHS) OK.
'Bye.

759
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,573
'Bye.
See you, Doug.

760
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,789
Get you next time!

761
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,955
Susan?

762
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,911
Craig!

763
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:08,200
Hey.
Oh. Long time no see.

764
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:10,286
Yeah, yeah. It has been a while.

765
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,995
Zara, um, this is Craig.
Zara, hello,

766
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:15,374
Yeah, I caught up with Doug.

767
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:17,498
I'm so sorry to hear about you guys.

768
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:20,124
Yeah, well, it's been
on the cards for a while now.

769
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:24,535
Well, if you ask me, he was a fool
to let you slip through his fingers.

770
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,369
(LAUGHS COYLY)

771
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:27,907
I'm off.

772
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,948
(WHISPERS) He's cute.

773
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:31,911
(LAUGHS)
I heard that. Thank you.

774
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:33,448
Sorry. (LAUGHS)

775
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:36,458
Mind if I join you?
Ah, please. Help yourself.

776
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,957
Well...

777
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,160
Cheers.

778
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,206
Well, this is it.

779
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:55,081
(QUACKS)

780
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,787
(EXHALES) Let's go.

781
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,619
OK. Now, no crapping
on the carpet, alright?

782
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,328
(QUACKS)

783
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,286
Mum! It's the loser duck guy.

784
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,699
Hi, Doug.
Hi.

785
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,911
I see you've already met my son, Taylor.

786
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:24,074
Your son.

787
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,582
He lost my communicator.

788
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,116
Uh...
You did?

789
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:31,157
Well... it was a misunderstanding.
He's mean.

790
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:34,075
Well, no. I'm sure
he didn't do it on purpose.

791
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,161
Course not.
No, I'm gonna get you a new one.

792
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,869
Whatever!

793
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:40,909
(SIGHS)
(LAUGHS)

794
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,619
Come in. Come in.

795
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,039
Oh, hello.

796
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:51,491
HOLLY: That's Artie.
He's Taylor's friend.

797
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:54,249
Oh, OK,
Practically lives here.

798
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:56,499
He's a bit different, but he's a good kid.

799
00:40:56,667 --> 00:41:00,114
Shall I put that in the fridge?
Yes. Please.

800
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,748
It's chardonnay.
Ooh!

801
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,373
Favorite.

802
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:05,999
So, what are you building?
Is it a rock?

803
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:08,408
It's not a rock, it's actually an asteroid.

804
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:09,948
It's NT7.

805
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:12,161
NT7.

806
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:15,291
ARTIE: You wouldn't understand.
I wouldn't?

807
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:19,201
It's an asteroid that's gonna
destroy the Earth in 2019.

808
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,616
It'll be the end of the world.
(PIERRE QUACKS)

809
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:24,204
Really? Wow!

810
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:26,866
There's nothing we can do to stop it.

811
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:31,783
OK, then.

812
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:37,998
You're joking.

813
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,160
Ugh!

814
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:47,994
You're an idiot!

815
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:51,657
Hello, Brenda.

816
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:52,993
Hello, Brent.

817
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:55,123
You look like you could do with a drink.

818
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:57,032
Care to join me?

819
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:03,657
OK. (LAUGHS)

820
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:09,373
DOUG: You can pet him. He won't bite.

821
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:12,329
Just, yeah, feel how soft
he is under there, look.

822
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,287
He's like a duck. It is a duck, isn't it?

823
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:17,744
(QUACKS)
HOLLY: OK, you lot.

824
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:19,998
Dinner's ready.

825
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:24,035
(QUACKS)
There you go.

826
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:28,240
I've got a joke.

827
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:29,782
Oh?
Oh, yeah?

828
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:32,495
What do you call a guy
with a spade in his head?

829
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:33,782
Dunno.

830
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:35,994
Doug!
(LAUGHS)

831
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:37,828
Very good.

832
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,786
Haven't actually heard that one before.

833
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,119
Really?
No.

834
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:45,784
Taylor... before it gets cold.

835
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,912
Mmm. That was great. Thank you.

836
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:05,573
Taylor...

837
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,207
Really into your
space stuff, aren't ya?

838
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,492
(LAUGHS)
He gets it from me, I'm afraid.

839
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:19,123
I love space.

840
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:22,159
And movies about landing
on the moon and stuff.

841
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,869
Really?

842
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:27,159
I think there's something
kind of sexy about space.

843
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:29,870
When I was a kid I...

844
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:32,533
...had this romantic dream that

845
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:36,496
one day a spaceman
would come down in his rocket

846
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,783
and whisk me off to the moon. (LAUGHS)

847
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:40,823
The moon!
Yeah. (LAUGHS)

848
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,993
So what about the, uh, lack of gravity and no air?
That didn't put you off?

849
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:47,783
No. (LAUGHS) I don't know.

850
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,949
Having lived in Lewisham...

851
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:53,743
...same place all my life, I just wanted
to get as far away from there as I could.

852
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:55,782
You know, there were
no flights to the moon

853
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:58,244
and I heard that New Zealand
was the next best thing.

854
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:03,036
So... here I am. (CHUCKLES)

855
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:05,950
Suppose it's nearly as far.
No!

856
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:08,036
Yes.

857
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:11,530
So do you ever think about
going back to the UK or...

858
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:14,495
Not really. Kinda settled here.

859
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:18,080
Taylor's a Kiwi, like his Dad is...

860
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:21,032
...was...

861
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,573
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

862
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,490
Oh, I've never left New Zealand.

863
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:26,032
Oh, really?
Yeah.

864
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:30,030
Wow. You must be the first
Kiwi I've met who hasn't travelled.

865
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:33,746
(LAUGHS) I'm just... not a fan of flying.

866
00:44:33,917 --> 00:44:35,453
Sure.

867
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:45,583
But... Doug, he was just so content
for things to stay the same and...

868
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,583
...after a while that just gets a bit...

869
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,991
Boring!

870
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:52,077
Yes!

871
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,162
Well, here's to you, then.
Mmm, Me.

872
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:57,665
Ah, no, no. You've got to
make eye contact. Come on.

873
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,949
Otherwise it's seven years bad sex.

874
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,197
Well, we can't have
that now, can we?

875
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,323
Taylor seems a bit down about this whole
end-of-the-world asteroid thing.

876
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,037
Yeah, well.

877
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:18,655
He lost his dad when
he was six and, um...

878
00:45:20,042 --> 00:45:21,407

01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:28,119
(MUFFLED) The <i>moon!</i>

1747
01:33:28,292 --> 01:33:30,157
This June.

1748
01:33:30,333 --> 01:33:31,914
I don't wanna go to Mumbai.

1749
01:33:32,083 --> 01:33:34,995
I don't wanna go
anywhere with you, OK?

1750
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:40,207
(SHOUTS)
I wanna take you to the moon!

1751
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,412
You can't take me to the moon, Doug.

1752
01:33:56,583 --> 01:33:59,290
Why not? He's got the suit.

1753
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:01,699
Yeah, hear him out.
He's gone to all this effort.

1754
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:03,786
WOMAN: You can't turn down
a trip to the moon.

1755
01:34:03,958 --> 01:34:08,782
Yes, she can. He dumped her and then
hooked up with his skanky ex-girlfriend.

1756
01:34:12,125 --> 01:34:14,207
OK, I'm a spineless jerk.

1757
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:17,286
And you were right.

1758
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:19,824
I'm just a man with a duck.

1759
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,082
But Pierre's gone. Alright?

1760
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:24,161
He flew.

1761
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:26,415
If he can fly...

1762
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:31,449
I'm falling in love with you, Holly.

1763
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:33,536
WOMEN: Aw...

1764
01:34:33,708 --> 01:34:35,915
WOMAN 2: It's so romantic.

1765
01:34:36,083 --> 01:34:38,540
Oh, give him another go.

1766
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:40,915
My husband would never
get dressed up for me.

1767
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:44,405
WOMAN 3: I'm lucky
if Bruce puts on trousers.

1768
01:34:58,208 --> 01:35:01,120
You think you can just turn up here...

1769
01:35:01,292 --> 01:35:04,204
...say you love me
and everything will be OK?

1770
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:07,911
Holly, I...

1771
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:12,619
That was for embarrassing me.

1772
01:35:17,917 --> 01:35:19,453
Oh...

1773
01:35:34,333 --> 01:35:36,949
And that's for embarrassing me.

1774
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:39,207
Sorry.

1775
01:35:51,625 --> 01:35:54,537
I can't really take you to the moon.
It's OK.

1776
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:56,664
(LAUGHS)

1777
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:59,575
But I can get you close.

1778
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:01,286
Look.

(UPBEAT ACOUSTIC MUSIC)

1781
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:21,745
But you don't even like flying.

1782
01:36:21,917 --> 01:36:24,954
Well, depends on my copilot.

1783
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:28,197
You're a bit of a dick, do you know that?

1784
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:31,208
Yeah. Little bit.
