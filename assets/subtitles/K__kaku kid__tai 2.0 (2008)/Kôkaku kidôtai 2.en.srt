1
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,350
<i>All patrolling air units...</i>

2
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,440
<i>a 208 is in progress
in the C-13 district of Newport City.</i>

3
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,649
<i>Airspace over this area will be closed.</i>

4
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:29,519
<i>Repeat.</i>

5
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:34,030
<i>All patrolling air units, a 208 is in progress
in the C-13 district of Newport City.</i>

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,030
<i>Airspace over this area will be closed.</i>

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,240
<i>Repeat.</i>

8
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:16,239
<i>There's no need for concern.</i>

9
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:19,069
<i>We can fix it
by redoing it in our country.</i>

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,659
<i>Redo it?</i>

11
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,829
<i>A program with no bugs doesn't exist...</i>

12
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,210
<i>and there's no program
that is impossible to debug. Am I wrong?</i>

13
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:30,289
<i>You don't understand.</i>

14
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,049
<i>We're not even sure
that Project 2501 really is a bug.</i>

15
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,259
<i>Originally the purpose of
this project was to...</i>

16
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:38,629
<i>Major,
Section 6 is in position and ready to move in.</i>

17
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,430
<i>Major!</i>

18
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,099
<i>I can hear you.</i>

19
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,599
<i>There's a lot of noise in your brain.</i>

20
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,939
It's that time of the month.

21
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:03,200
Don't you think there's going to be trouble
if we interfere with a Section 6 case.

22
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,620
The target is
a notoriously bad diplomat...

23
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,120
the best they can do is deport him.

24
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,330
We're the only ones who can get our hands dirty.

25
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,710
It's time.
Let's move to the rendezvous point.

26
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,340
What? The police?

27
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,430
Stop it!
Who told you to fire?!

28
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,349
Put your guns down!

29
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:16,860
I'm entitled to diplomatic immunity.

30
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:18,530
I want to talk to the person in charge.

31
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,240
Taking classified programmers out of the country
compromises national security.

32
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,370
We can also have you brought up
on kidnapping charges...

33
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,240
so let him go.

34
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:30,829
That's not possible.

35
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,670
Mr. Daita has requested political asylum,
and we have a signed affidavit.

36
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:35,500
When?

37
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,539
I don't have to explain.

38
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,259
My country has the right,
in accordance with international law...

39
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,219
to offer anyone protection
and safe passage.

40
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,719
The affidavit is at the embassy.

41
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:47,800
I'll send you a copy
in a couple of days.

42
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:49,889
Are you sure?
You'll be killed if you return.

43
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,020
I'm warning you
to watch your comments.

44
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,810
Our country is
a peace loving democracy.

45
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,060
<i>Oh really?</i>

46
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:01,110
The window!
Shoot!

47
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,620
Thermo-optic camouflage.

48
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:02,370
Aramaki, what a surprise.

49
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,830
So, what business brings the chief of Section 9
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

50
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,289
It's about the secret talks scheduled
with the Gavel Republic tomorrow.

51
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:12,169
Oh, the Official Development Assistance.

52
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:16,720
The regime that took over Gavel after the revolution
demands financial aid, supposedly for redevelopment.

53
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,009
They boast about democracy,
but they're no better than the Iast Iot.

54
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,519
Now they feel entitled to funds
because of our past exploitation. No gratitude.

55
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,730
What's the Ministry going to do?

56
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:31,610
Well, there's a problem.
The leader of the former junta...

57
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,779
that controlled their country
is here seeking political asylum.

58
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,610
You mean Colonel Malles, correct?

59
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,450
Yes, and that means we either deny Gavel the funds
and treat Malles as a political refuge...

60
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,080
or help them and kick him out.

61
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,039
It's a tricky situation.

62
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:47,909
My personal opinion is if we could find
a politically acceptable reason...

63
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,629
I'd like to forcibly
deport him immediately.

64
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:02,929
By the way, I want to thank you for your help
with that other political asylum situation.

65
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:05,519
Nakamura from Section 6
was also grateful.

66
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,350
We diplomats must avoid
messy situations, you realize.

67
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,690
Access.

68
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,029
We've lost response.

69
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,860
What's happened to the EEG output.

70
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,279
It's normal.
I'll switch to Simex mode.

71
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,200
The Foreign Minister's interpreter.

72
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:31,750
23 minutes ago, her brain
was hacked into through a phone line.

73
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,129
Foreign Intelligence warned us
about this.

74
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,629
The "Puppet Master" has begun to infiltrate terminals
throughout our network.

75
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,139
We believe it's extremely likely that he'll target
the secret talks scheduled with the Republic of Gavel.

76
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:48,600
We've put everyone attending the talks
under surveillance.

77
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,980
I suspect once he hacked into her ghost,
he'd use her to assassinate key delegates.

78
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,860
So how long do we have before this hacker breaks
through her barrier program and reaches her ghost?

79
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,120
Roughly 2 hours.
He's using an old-fashioned HA-3 virus.

80
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,740
After that, we'll have to break the connection
to avoid any danger.

81
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,500
Batou and Ishikawa are tracking
the signal source from their car.

82
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,250
Contact them.

83
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:32,350
That infamous mystery hacker,
the Puppet Master, has shown up here?

84
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,360
We guess he or she is American,
but we have no clue about age, sex or background.

85
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,110
Since last winter,
he's been popping up in EU countries.

86
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,200
He's wanted for crimes
including stock manipulation...

87
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,860
illegal information gathering,
political terrorism...

88
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,570
computer ethic infringements...

89
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,659
and is under suspicion for several other crimes.
He's on the international most wanted list.

90
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,289
The nickname Puppet Master
comes from the ghost hacking.

91
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:58,629
It's the first time
he's appeared in this country.

92
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:03,049
Well, if he's so skilled how come
he's using an outdated HA-3 virus?

93
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:07,600
A more current technique would be
harder to detect and trace...

94
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,600
but it might also arouse suspicion
about Colonel Malles role in this affair.

95
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,899
Are you saying he's using an old method
just so no-one suspects Malles?

96
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,190
Or maybe Malles is just a pawn,
used to make us think that...

97
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,570
Maybe there is another sponsor.

98
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,740
Now you're stretching it.
It's not like you have any hard evidence.

99
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,500
Evidence?

100
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:37,289
Just a whisper.
I hear it in my ghost.

101
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,710
Which reminds me.
Are you still using that revolver?

102
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,590
You should stop worrying about
the automatics jamming up.

103
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:45,470
I like my Matever.

104
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:49,759
Stopping power is more important
than your taste in guns.

105
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:53,679
Since it's my ass on the line out there,
use a Zastaber.

106
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,309
Major.

107
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,769
I want to ask you something.

108
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,269
Why did you transfer a guy like me
from the police force?

109
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,990
Because we need a guy like you.

110
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:09,409
You're an honest cop who's never
stepped out of line, and you're a family man.

111
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,289
Except for the slight brain augmentation,
your body's almost completely human.

112
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,659
No matter how excellent...

113
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:22,629
identical standard systems have faults.

114
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,259
What's true for the group
is also true for the individual.

115
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,299
Over specialize and you breed in weakness.
It's a slow death.

116
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,679
That's all.

117
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,059
Hurry up!

118
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,980
I'll be right there!

119
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,950
We're already 40 seconds late!

120
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,659
I'll be done in 5 seconds.

121
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,830
It's gonna be one of those days.

122
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,580
Hey. Sorry, pal.

123
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:07,009
My last partner who got busted workin'
as an illegal alien, was a lot better than you.

124
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,139
You're that desperate to find out
your wife's feelings, you'd ghost-hack her?

125
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,559
She hardly talks to me and
all of a sudden she wants a divorce!

126
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:24,230
What's worse, my daughter ignores me and got it
into her head that I'm the one cheating on her mom.

127
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,360
How did you get your hands
on a barrier breaker?

128
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,240
From this really nice programmer
I met in a bar.

129
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,200
He overheard my sob story. My wife's lawyer
stopped me seeing her and my daughter.

130
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:41,879
He showed me how to hack in from different places
along the route, without being traced.

131
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,379
Are you trying to kill yourself,
asshole?!

132
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,179
Looks like we're not the only ones
in a hurry round here.

133
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,929
No one here!

134
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:02,600
Every time we get to the source
they're already long gone.

135
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,230
We're just wasting our time.

136
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,519
<i>Quit complaining!</i>

137
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,700
<i>Kusanagi and Togusa are heading to the next area
the hacker's expected to access from. Stay alert.</i>

138
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:12,529
What are we looking for, Chief?

139
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,450
<i>Anything.</i>

140
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,080
Stupid old fart.
Are we just meant to ask around?

141
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,909
Oh, shit...

142
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,539
I missed him!

143
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,669
Hey, Pop,
did you see the trash truck?

144
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,169
Who wants to know?

145
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,169
Just answer me.
Did you see it or not?

146
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:31,799
Yeah, I saw the trash man...

147
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:34,679
making a call, so I thought I had enough time
to bring my garbage down.

148
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:40,309
Hey!
Can't you take this?

149
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,519
A trash truck? Clever.
It changes location every 7 minutes.

150
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:48,779
HQ, patch me into info
from the Sanitation Department network.

151
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:01,580
<i>8 trucks are on duty
in the surveillance area.</i>

152
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,960
<i>The target is number 79,
a type C vehicle.</i>

153
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,340
<i>Give me the wheel.</i>

154
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,970
They might have
contacted someone.

155
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:21,470
Follow them
but take no action.

156
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,059
Route data accessed.

157
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,350
Hacking points traced and matched.

158
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,899
<i>The target has now stopped
at the next point.</i>

159
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,399
<i>HA-3 access confirmed.</i>

160
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,830
Sorry, sorry.

161
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:43,659
How about if I pick up the trash and
you make the calls on the second round?

162
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,080
How do you think?

163
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:48,080
Ain't no way
I'm gonna be your partner in crime.

164
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:50,039
It's pathetic.

165
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,879
You got any children?

166
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:53,629
Do I look like I do?

167
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Then you can't understand.

168
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:58,259
My daughter is everything to me.

169
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,350
Look. She's like an angel.

170
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,519
I'm not interested in crap like that.

171
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,569
Yeah, vehicle 79.
Ah, boss... What's that?

172
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,190
What do the cops want to know
our rounds for?

173
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:16,819
How would I know?

174
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,160
They found out!

175
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,410
I've got to warn that guy
who helped me.

176
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:25,369
We're gonna have to skip
the next pickup.

177
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,079
What?

178
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,500
<i>Target has deviated from route and
is heading toward the next pickup point.</i>

179
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,630
<i>There's no way
they spotted me following them.</i>

180
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,509
<i>They probably traced me when I accessed
the Sanitation Department network.</i>

181
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,430
Next time, use a back door.

182
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:41,470
<i>Forget it, just arrest them.</i>

183
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:47,559
You can drive now.

184
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:49,599
Huh? Whoa.

185
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:54,000
Christ, he's fucked up the armored van.

186
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,420
<i>He's got high velocity bullets.
They'll go straight through your car door.</i>

187
00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:00,299
<i>HV ammo in a submachine gun?
He's insane.</i>

188
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,569
<i>He's even wearing
some kind of thermo-optics.</i>

189
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,740
<i>Keep on his tail.
I'll come around from above.</i>

190
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,819
<i>Togusa! If you're still alive,
arrest those garbage men.</i>

191
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,240
<i>Affirmative.</i>

192
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,500
This job is merciless.

193
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,390
Police!
Everyone get down.

194
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,009
Are you finished?

195
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,559
Got him, huh?

196
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:29,900
That's what happens
when you use HV bullets.

197
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,029
The breach and barrel are
really screwed up.

198
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:37,579
It's no use arresting me,
I'm not talkin' to any damn cops!

199
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,250
Talk?

200
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:46,250
You don't even know
your own name, you dick-head.

201
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:52,630
Can you remember your mother's face,
or where you were born?

202
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,259
Do you have any childhood memories?

203
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,059
Do you remember anything?

204
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,480
Puppets without their ghosts are
so pathetic.

205
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:12,279
Especially the kind
with red blood running through them.

206
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,299
We'll rush the place after
the passengers have gone in.

207
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,130
Squad B comes in from the back,
the rest of you go in the front.

208
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:37,970
Saito, get your men to unplug
all cars parked in front of the house.

209
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,759
Begin recording.

210
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,190
Message from HQ, sir.

211
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:49,150
<i>We've ID'd the man the major caught.</i>

212
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,480
Go on.

213
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:53,190
<i>He claims to be Tsuan Gen Fang, age 28.</i>

214
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,319
<i>Illegal alien.
Weapons violations. Three priors.</i>

215
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:03,160
<i>Was hiding out with a militant refugee group
up till a month ago.</i>

216
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:09,750
<i>About a week ago, a military liaison in the Gavel embassy</i>

217
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,960
<i>commissioned him to attack
the upcoming secret meeting.</i>

218
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:15,130
And in reality?

219
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,180
<i>His nickname's Corgi.</i>

220
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:20,349
<i>Occupation, a rather violent trader
in questionable goods.</i>

221
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,349
<i>Your basic thug.</i>

222
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,190
<i>We've checked his police records...</i>

223
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:30,150
<i>but can't find any connection with Gavel.</i>

224
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,359
<i>This guy's just another puppet
controlled by the Puppet Master.</i>

225
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,029
How's Ishikawa doing?

226
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:41,410
<i>He's back and interrogating
that garbage collector with Togusa.</i>

227
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,710
<i>So how about the Puppet Master?</i>

228
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:48,710
<i>What's he like?</i>

229
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,220
He's like a puppet himself.

230
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:57,470
<i>Squad B in position.</i>

231
00:25:57,549 --> 00:25:59,049
<i>Squads A and C, okay.</i>

232
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,390
Ready and waiting, sir.

233
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,140
Proceed!

234
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:09,849
What's "a simulated experience" again?

235
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,980
Well, all your memories about your wife,
daughter and divorce are false.

236
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:16,779
Like a dream.

237
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,950
You were used by someone to ghost-hack
into some government officials.

238
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:24,119
But... that can't be.

239
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,910
I went to your home...

240
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,750
it's a bachelor's apartment.

241
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:33,210
I told you.
I rented it after we separated.

242
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,630
I checked the records.
You've been living there for 10 years.

243
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,220
You've never had a wife or kid.

244
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:43,099
Your family only exists in your head.

245
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,640
Look.

246
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:48,390
This is the photo
you showed your co-worker.

247
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:50,480
Who do you see?

248
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,940
It was a picture of my daughter.

249
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,900
Smiling like an angel.

250
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,150
What's her name?

251
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:04,950
Where did you meet your wife
and when did you marry her?

252
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,329
Tell me.
Who do you see in the photo?

253
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,839
<i>If it's all a lie,
when will I get my old memory back?</i>

254
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,630
<i>Unfortunately with our current technology...</i>

255
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,180
<i>only 2 successful cases have ever been reported,
so I wouldn't recommend trying to.</i>

256
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,599
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

257
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,509
Even simulated experiences and dreams...

258
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,980
exist as information,
and are simultaneously reality...

259
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,349
and fantasy.

260
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:39,819
The information that people accumulate in their life,
is just a drop in bucket.

261
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,849
A cyborg who goes diving in her spare time. That can't be a good sign.

262
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,309
How long have you been doing it?

263
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:08,740
Aren't you afraid of the sea?
What if the floaters don't work?

264
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:10,579
I suppose I'll die.

265
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,950
Or would you dive in after me?

266
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,710
No one forced you
to come out here with me.

267
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,329
I...

268
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,329
So what's it like to swim in the sea?

269
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,789
You've done
the underwater training course.

270
00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:00,079
I'm not talking about a damn pool.

271
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,589
I feel fear, anxiety,
isolation and darkness.

272
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,089
Sometimes I feel hope...

273
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,390
Hope?
In those deep, dark waters?

274
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:15,890
When I float back to the surface,
I imagine I'm becoming someone else.

275
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,599
It's probably the decompression.

276
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,319
Do you want to quit Section 9?

277
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,029
Batou, how much of your body is original?

278
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,579
Are you drunk or something?

279
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,200
Easily remedied.

280
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:40,170
The chemical implants in our bodies...

281
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,339
can sober us up in seconds.
No stupor, no hangover.

282
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,380
That's why we can drink here
while waiting for orders.

283
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:53,599
Man has an almost instinctive
drive to realize any possible technological advances.

284
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,180
Controlled metabolisms,
computer enhanced brains...

285
00:30:57,269 --> 00:31:00,019
Improved reflexes and muscle capacity.

286
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:02,690
The ability to process vast amounts of information
at increasing speeds...

287
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:07,480
all due to electronic brains and cybernetic bodies,
enabling the acquisition of ever greater powers.

288
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:11,200
So what if we can't survive
without regular high-level maintenance.

289
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
Who are we to complain?

290
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:17,240
We haven't signed our bodies
and souls away to Section 9.

291
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:20,710
True. We can quit...

292
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:25,589
but we'd have to give back our cyborg parts
and augmented brains to the government.

293
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:30,130
All components that make up me
as an individual.

294
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,890
There are countless ingredients
that make up the human body and mind.

295
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:38,470
A face and voice to distinguish
oneself from others...

296
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,559
the hand you see when you wake up, your childhood
memories and feelings about your future.

297
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:45,019
And that's not all.

298
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:48,940
There's also the ability to access vast amounts of
information from an infinite network...

299
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:54,160
All of that blends to create a mixture
that forms me, and gives rise to my conscience.

300
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,410
At the same time though,
I feel continually confined within boundaries...

301
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,960
So that's the reason
you risk your body diving in the sea!

302
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:11,799
What the hell can you see at the bottom
in that darkness?

303
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:17,430
<i>Now it's like
we're looking through a mirror.</i>

304
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:21,599
<i>And what we see is a dim image.</i>

305
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,769
Was that you?

306
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:36,309
<i>Sensors have resumed functioning.</i>

307
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,190
<i>Connection check
to backup brain okay.</i>

308
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,980
<i>Visual sensors are back on line.</i>

309
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,320
<i>And its body functions?</i>

310
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,199
<i>Output is normal.</i>

311
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:52,750
<i>If you're going to be late,
at least let us know!</i>

312
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:59,340
Preparations complete.
Shall we proceed?

313
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,280
That's enough. Stop.

314
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,699
Come to my office in 3 minutes.

315
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:38,210
Since you were late,
I'll explain what's going on.

316
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:42,250
About 2 hours ago, a machining cell
at the Megatech factory in Newport...

317
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,969
assembled a cyber body,
on its own volition.

318
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,840
When the supervisors arrived...

319
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:49,929
the body had already fled.

320
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,059
We put out bulletins
and initiated a citywide search.

321
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:59,690
A truck driver reported he'd run over
a naked woman on the highway.

322
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:01,900
And the body was brought here.

323
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,030
Megatech is contracted
by the government.

324
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,110
All their cybernetic bodies are classified.

325
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:12,489
We've a hacker good enough
to get past the best defenses...

326
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:14,869
but that's not the only problem.

327
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,670
Of course, there isn't
a human brain cell in its head...

328
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,050
but there appears to be a ghost
present in its auxiliary brain.

329
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:34,469
It resembles a ghost-line that occurs
when a real ghost is copied.

330
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,269
But there's no evidence of the degradation
that's usually incurred.

331
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:42,519
In any case, until we chart the ghost sector
and dive into it...

332
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,860
we can't be sure.

333
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,860
I better get back to working on it.

334
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:49,320
Very good.

335
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:52,159
On to the disassembly.

336
00:38:56,949 --> 00:39:01,880
Nobody really believes
there's a ghost in that body, do they?

337
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,789
Why not?

338
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,460
Even a plastic doll can have a soul.

339
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,340
Consider all the neuro-med devices
that are crammed into that body.

340
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:14,760
I wouldn't be surprised if there were
some sort of ghost in there too.

341
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:19,019
As you're new, you don't know...

342
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:22,809
but Major Kusanagi's body
was also made by Megatech.

343
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,110
Not only her.
Also parts of me, Ishikawa, and Saito.

344
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,449
We also receive regular
cybernetic maintenance from them.

345
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:35,869
Apart from you and the chief,
the whole section comes with a warranty.

346
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:41,039
That's why we're all so concerned
with this case, Togusa.

347
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:46,250
We don't know if the culprit is inside
or outside that body but...

348
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,219
he hacked through our best defenses,
put a body together...

349
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,090
and sent a program
with a ghost line in it.

350
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:55,599
A sure way to draw attention to oneself.

351
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,059
What's the logic here?

352
00:39:57,309 --> 00:39:59,219
Theft isn't the issue here.

353
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:03,559
Togusa, go with Ishikawa to
the Megatech facility.

354
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,599
Batou.

355
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:08,570
Lock down other highly classified networks
similar to Megatech's.

356
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,530
Recheck the barriers are
functioning too.

357
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,610
I'm assembling a barrier maze.

358
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:16,320
Tomorrow I'll dive into that thing.

359
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:17,739
Is that safe?

360
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:19,539
Why not contain it
in another body first?

361
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:25,579
I have to see for myself
what's in there.

362
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,800
Don't let anybody else in there!

363
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,760
What's up with her?

364
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,760
She's been acting weird ever since
this whole Puppet Master case started.

365
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:39,260
It's all in my report.

366
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:40,929
Don't you read them?

367
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:46,940
Chief, do you ever wonder about the neurosurgeons
who monkey around inside your brain?

368
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:51,610
They undergo
regular psychiatric evaluations.

369
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,280
Especially those in security are
subjected to stringent screening.

370
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,530
Of course, the ones
who check are only human.

371
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:01,289
If you start wondering,
there's no end to it.

372
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:06,420
<i>Excuse me Chief, Mr. Nakamura of
the Treaties Bureau is here to see you.</i>

373
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:07,960
Send him through.

374
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,969
I've seen that fat guy before.

375
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:25,599
He's Nakamura, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, Section 6 Chief.

376
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,019
Never seen the other guy before, though.

377
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,530
Well, see you later.

378
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,780
Tell Ishikawa not to go crazy, okay.

379
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:45,500
What's on your mind?

380
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:48,000
Didn't that robot remind you of me?

381
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,079
No it didn't.

382
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,840
I don't mean physically.

383
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,340
What then?

384
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,179
Maybe all complete cyborgs like me start wondering this.

385
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,510
That perhaps I died a long time ago.

386
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:05,769
...and I'm a replicant
made with a cyborg body and computer brain.

387
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:10,019
Or maybe there never was
a real me in the first place.

388
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,530
You've got human brain cells
in that titanium shell of yours...

389
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,070
and you're treated like a human,
aren't you?

390
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:19,199
Has anyone actually seen
their own brain?

391
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,829
I believe I exist based only
on what my environment tells me.

392
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:26,500
Are you doubting your own ghost?

393
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:29,539
What if a cyber-brain
could generate its own ghost...

394
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,539
create a soul by itself?

395
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,630
What could you base your belief
in yourself on then?

396
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:43,559
That's bullshit.

397
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:50,900
You know your dying to see
what's inside that thing.

398
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,480
So check it out, with your own ghost!

399
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,530
We're both busy men,
so let's keep this short, shall we?

400
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,739
Yes. That's my intention.

401
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,199
We've come for the program
in that body.

402
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,199
You'll be relieved of any duties
connected with this.

403
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:07,199
The Foreign Minister's approval.

404
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:22,889
Security, whose official vehicles
are in the basement parking lot?

405
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:28,269
<i>According to the register, a Mr. Nakamura
from the Treaties Bureau and a Dr. Willis, sir.</i>

406
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,940
Get me the video records
of their entrance.

407
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:41,360
Again. In infrared this time.

408
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,880
1... 2... 3...

409
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,639
Now give me the pressure sensors records
for basement parking lots...

410
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,260
B7 and B8.

411
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,500
<i>Major, this is Togusa.
Code 09.</i>

412
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:34,619
<i>What's up?</i>

413
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,789
<i>Does that Nakamura guy
have a special-order cyborg body?</i>

414
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,920
<i>No, there aren't any cyborgs in Section 6
as they operate overseas.</i>

415
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,679
<i>Maintenance is difficult and
there are diplomatic considerations too.</i>

416
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,550
<i>Then, even if the other guy
is a cyborg...</i>

417
00:44:47,809 --> 00:44:51,019
<i>the 2 of them together
couldn't weigh over 1,000 pounds.</i>

418
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:53,599
<i>The pressure sensor records.
From the parking lot?</i>

419
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:58,190
<i>Right, there were two expensive looking cars
but neither man looked like the type to drive.</i>

420
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,690
<i>The security cameras show only 2 people.</i>

421
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,320
<i>But remember how sensitive the sensors
on the entrance doors are?</i>

422
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:05,860
<i>The doors took a full 3 second longer
than usual to close after the 2 went in.</i>

423
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:11,199
<i>And it is illegal to use thermo-optics
inside governmental facilities.</i>

424
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:14,159
<i>It's a serious violation of
the National Security Act.</i>

425
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,130
<i>Section 6 must be up to something.</i>

426
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,880
<i>Are you ready?</i>

427
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,289
<i>With my trusty Matever, anytime.</i>

428
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:00,039
Need I remind you that...

429
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,380
it's an act of treason to withhold information
from me that is relevant to this matter...

430
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,380
regardless of how classified it is.

431
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:06,800
Same goes for you.

432
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:11,099
Despite the intent of the Foreign Ministry,
this falls within Section 9's jurisdiction.

433
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:16,349
Of course we have no objections to cooperating
if there's a good reason.

434
00:46:17,389 --> 00:46:18,730
Dr. Willis?

435
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:19,980
It's confirmed.

436
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,809
No doubt, it's her.

437
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,570
"Her"?

438
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:28,360
The Doctor is referring to the original ghost-line
that's now in the body.

439
00:46:28,449 --> 00:46:30,699
The sex of the perpetrator is unknown...

440
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,449
and "her" is just a nickname
the Doctor gave it.

441
00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:36,500
Allow me to introduce to you.

442
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:40,829
This is the most extraordinary hacker
in the history of cyber crime.

443
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,840
The Puppet Master.

444
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,090
<i>Your people at Section 9 came across her work too
in that ghost-hacking incident...</i>

445
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:50,340
<i>involving the Foreign Minister's interpreter.</i>

446
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,639
<i>Since her appearance,
Section 6 has taken a great interest...</i>

447
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:58,059
<i>and has been following
the Puppet Master's trail.</i>

448
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:01,230
<i>We put together a project team
headed by Dr. Willis.</i>

449
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:04,269
<i>They analyzed the data
on the Puppet Master and...</i>

450
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,989
<i>this gave us an understanding of
her behavioral and code patterns.</i>

451
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,159
<i>Ultimately, this enabled us
to devise a strategy...</i>

452
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,699
<i>in which we lured her program
into a designated body.</i>

453
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:19,039
<i>You caused the Puppet Master
to dive into a cyborg...</i>

454
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:21,460
<i>and then murdered her real body?</i>

455
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,420
<i>Yes, that sums it up.</i>

456
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,340
She just happened to
come to your country.

457
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,170
She's originally from America
and they helped us capture her.

458
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,260
That's why we'd like to
take her back ourselves.

459
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,760
I hope you have no objections.

460
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:38,559
Just another unidentified corpse...

461
00:47:40,849 --> 00:47:42,690
<i>You will not find a corpse...</i>

462
00:47:42,769 --> 00:47:47,019
<i>because I have never possessed a body.</i>

463
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,690
Why are her sensors on?

464
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,150
Why didn't you say so before?

465
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,860
All external controls are turned off.

466
00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:54,530
The body's using its own power source.

467
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:56,530
<i>I entered this body...</i>

468
00:47:56,619 --> 00:47:59,579
<i>because I was unable to overcome
Section 6's reactive barriers.</i>

469
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,880
<i>However, what you are now witnessing
is an act of my own free will.</i>

470
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,550
<i>As a sentient life-form,
I hereby demand political asylum.</i>

471
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,300
A sentient life-form?

472
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,260
Ridiculous!
It's just a program for self-preservation.

473
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:17,219
<i>It can also be argued that your DNA...</i>

474
00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:21,059
<i>is nothing more than a program
designed to preserve itself.</i>

475
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:27,570
<i>Life is like a nodal point born in
an overwhelming sea of information.</i>

476
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:28,900
<i>And life,
when organized into species...</i>

477
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,320
<i>relies upon genes
to be its memory system.</i>

478
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,070
<i>So man is an individual memory system
only because of his intangible memory.</i>

479
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:41,909
<i>And a memory cannot be defined,
but it defines mankind.</i>

480
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,920
<i>When the advent of computers
made the externalization of memories possible...</i>

481
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:50,800
<i>you should have taken
its meaning more seriously.</i>

482
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,800
Nonsense! Your babbling offers no proof at all
that you're a living, thinking life-form.

483
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:59,599
<i>Proving it is impossible...</i>

484
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:04,809
<i>because modern science
cannot explain what life is.</i>

485
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:07,440
Who the hell are you?

486
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:11,900
Even if you do have a ghost,
we don't offer freedom to criminals.

487
00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:14,280
You chose the wrong place to defect.

488
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,320
<i>Time is always on my side.</i>

489
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,780
<i>I've now acquired
the possibility of death but...</i>

490
00:49:19,909 --> 00:49:22,699
<i>there is no death sentence in this country.</i>

491
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:25,619
Half immortal...
An artificial intelligence?

492
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,670
<i>I am not an AI.</i>

493
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:33,260
<i>My code name is Project 2501.</i>

494
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,510
I am a living, thinking entity
who was created in the sea of information.

495
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,059
We're under attack!

496
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,400
Chief!
The Puppet Master's gone!

497
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,130
What in God's name are your security officers doing?

498
00:49:53,969 --> 00:49:54,809
Security.

499
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,489
Shut the defense walls now!

500
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,860
Security, answer!

501
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:23,010
Shut up you bastard!

502
00:50:27,019 --> 00:50:28,559
Fuck you!

503
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:34,440
<i>Did you do it?</i>

504
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:36,690
<i>An armored car.</i>

505
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,449
<i>A 9mm wouldn't even scratch it.</i>

506
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:41,159
<i>Your Matever is useless.</i>

507
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:46,539
<i>Yeah, rookie's luck.</i>

508
00:50:46,659 --> 00:50:47,909
<i>I nailed a tracker bullet
right into the plate.</i>

509
00:50:48,289 --> 00:50:49,289
<i>Great shot, eh?</i>

510
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,500
<i>Next time, nail 2 bullets.</i>

511
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,880
<i>Let's begin.
Catch up to them before they change cars.</i>

512
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,139
I'm filing a formal complaint
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

513
00:51:02,889 --> 00:51:05,309
Find her and report to me.

514
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:07,139
And capture her alive!

515
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:11,190
Bodies are a dime dozen.
We'll get her another one from Megatech.

516
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,650
<i>Togusa and Batou are
in pursuit of the abductors.</i>

517
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,239
They just turned on to R25.

518
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,239
<i>If you were monitoring,
why didn't you intervene?</i>

519
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:28,039
If we grab 'em now, we may not
be able to connect this to Section 6.

520
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:28,869
<i>Section 6?</i>

521
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:33,210
<i>Someone's using the same
thermo-optic camouflage as mine, Type 2902.</i>

522
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:35,460
<i>It's only used by our people,
rangers in Section 4...</i>

523
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:36,840
<i>and by Section 6.</i>

524
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,510
<i>I see.</i>

525
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,260
<i>So Section 6 forced the Puppet Master
into a cyborg body.</i>

526
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:46,599
Through Megatech, who happens to be
closely aligned with Section 9.

527
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:48,969
And when she proclaimed
to be a life-form...

528
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:51,809
and sought asylum,
they snatched her.

529
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,059
But why do such a thing?

530
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,150
I'd have handed her over
if they gave me a deposition.

531
00:51:56,269 --> 00:51:59,070
<i>What if they were worried
she'd let some secrets out?</i>

532
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:04,070
<i>She did mention something about
a code name, Project 2501.</i>

533
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,409
I'll leave the detective stuff to you.

534
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:10,539
As for arresting the attackers
and confiscating evidence?

535
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:11,619
<i>Proceed.</i>

536
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:12,829
You heard him!

537
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,980
Kusanagi, one last thing.

538
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:36,309
<i>If it's about me disobeying orders,
you can punish me when I get back.</i>

539
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,110
If you're unable to recapture
the Puppet Master, you must destroy it...

540
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,570
without fail.

541
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,449
Did you hear me?

542
00:52:44,989 --> 00:52:46,409
<i>Understood.</i>

543
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:50,409
Have the airport stop
all flights with Foreign Ministry...

544
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,000
or American officials
on their passenger lists.

545
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:55,670
Close all roads and
set up checkpoints.

546
00:52:55,789 --> 00:52:57,590
Alert all emergency personnel.

547
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,960
And get Ishikawa back here.

548
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,340
Get me the identity of the man who was
with Nakamura from the entrance records.

549
00:53:03,429 --> 00:53:07,639
Collect any data regarding a code name,
operation, on anything...

550
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:10,679
involving the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
called Project 2501.

551
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:18,650
Is there any news
from the attack squad?

552
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,860
<i>They just changed cars a minute ago.</i>

553
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,900
<i>They'll contact the decoy
in about 5 minutes.</i>

554
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,070
Make sure
they stay alert for any tails.

555
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:26,199
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

556
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:28,699
I don't understand anything anymore.

557
00:53:28,829 --> 00:53:32,079
Why would the Puppet Master
choose to run to Section 9?

558
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:33,579
Not sure...

559
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,500
but there must be a reason
that's beyond our imagination.

560
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,840
I don't know.
Maybe she has the hots for someone there.

561
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,510
Utter nonsense.

562
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,150
<i>Hey, Chief.</i>

563
00:55:23,269 --> 00:55:25,360
Ishikawa?
What is it?

564
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,280
I've been divin' around
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs net.

565
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,820
I think I found some juicy bits
of information for ya.

566
00:55:30,909 --> 00:55:32,989
<i>Wait, I'll switch to
an encrypted channel.</i>

567
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,869
Okay now? Well, here's the scoop on
that guy who showed up with Nakamura.

568
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:41,920
He's an American: Dr. Willis.
Head of Strategic Research at Neutron Company.

569
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,170
A top researcher in the field of AI.

570
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:48,050
He headed a project for
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs...

571
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:51,179
and who do you think
was the main programmer on his team?

572
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,510
<i>Get to the point.</i>

573
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,550
Mr. Mizuho Daita.
28 years old.

574
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:59,059
Remember him? He's the programmer
Section 6 tried like hell to stop from defecting...

575
00:55:59,179 --> 00:56:03,980
so the Major took out the diplomat who was going to take him.

576
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:04,900
<i>Go on.</i>

577
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:08,280
What's bugging me is
that this project began 1 year...

578
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,739
before the Puppet Master
appeared on the scene.

579
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,110
<i>A year before?</i>

580
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,030
<i>But wasn't it a project
set up to capture the Puppet Master?</i>

581
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:18,739
Well, try this one.

582
00:56:18,869 --> 00:56:21,369
They definitely were chasing
the Puppet Master...

583
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:25,920
but maybe it was not to capture her,
but to recapture her...

584
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,250
<i>When that ghost-hacking incident happened
with the Minister's interpreter...</i>

585
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,380
<i>it was the MOA that wanted an excuse
to deport Malles.</i>

586
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,929
<i>Maybe we've been taken for a ride.</i>

587
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,139
What if this Puppet Master is...

588
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:42,769
really some sort of a tool the MOA uses
to get their way with things...

589
00:56:42,889 --> 00:56:45,190
and somehow, they lost control of it?

590
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:48,110
So they are in a hurry to get it back.

591
00:56:48,269 --> 00:56:53,400
That would explain why they went to such lengths
to snatch the body from Section 9.

592
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,820
If the Puppet Master revealed
this to the world...

593
00:56:56,909 --> 00:56:58,909
there'd be one hell of an international stink.

594
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:01,949
It wouldn't only be the foreign minister
who'd lose his job.

595
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:04,369
<i>Any details on that project?</i>

596
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,630
No. They've blocked all access.
I can only tell you the file name.

597
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,130
Project 2501.

598
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,010
<i>Keep at it.
Don't let them know you're looking.</i>

599
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:15,340
You got it.

600
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:24,099
Project 2501...

601
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,269
the Puppet Master plan.

602
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,980
<i>Target has contacted a second vehicle.</i>

603
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:31,360
Batou?

604
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,940
<i>They've pulled up to a white sedan
parked on the roadside.</i>

605
00:57:34,699 --> 00:57:37,320
<i>It looks like they're moving
something from the backseat.</i>

606
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:41,449
<i>Ah, they're rollin' again.
So is the white sedan.</i>

607
00:57:41,909 --> 00:57:42,789
<i>A decoy?</i>

608
00:57:42,869 --> 00:57:46,579
Possibly, or maybe that's what they
want us to think. What do I do?

609
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,829
<i>I'll take care of the sedan.</i>

610
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,960
<i>How do you know that's your man?</i>

611
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:52,840
<i>Is there a whisper in your ghost again?</i>

612
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,260
<i>Maybe.</i>

613
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,969
I knew she'd say that.

614
00:57:56,179 --> 00:57:59,219
<i>Target 02 is getting off R25
and moving toward the Old Town.</i>

615
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,099
<i>No cars within 2 km.</i>

616
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:03,599
<i>Evacuation completed.</i>

617
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,440
<i>How far are you from the target?</i>

618
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:13,150
Point blank. I'm ready.

619
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:13,940
<i>Go for it.</i>

620
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:02,989
Did you get him?

621
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:04,199
No.

622
00:59:04,489 --> 00:59:06,659
Jesus Christ. What a mess.

623
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,369
You didn't have to go that far.

624
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:10,539
Oh, hey!

625
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,039
Take those assholes away.

626
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:16,510
Call the Chief to get some backup
for the Major. See you!

627
00:59:22,219 --> 00:59:26,599
Does a tough chick
like that need a hand?

628
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:44,780
<i>The flood hit this part of
Old Town the hardest.</i>

629
00:59:44,909 --> 00:59:46,539
<i>Why come to an abandoned place
like this?</i>

630
00:59:46,829 --> 00:59:49,329
<i>They wouldn't come here
without a reason.</i>

631
00:59:49,409 --> 00:59:52,460
<i>Maybe they're heading out to sea by boat
or helicopter. Or it's an ambush.</i>

632
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,840
Don't you think you ought to
wait for backup?

633
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,630
<i>There's a reason I can't wait.</i>

634
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,670
<i>Take me above that building,
approaching from the sea side.</i>

635
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,019
<i>I'll stay here to keep watch and
mediate communication until I run short of fuel.</i>

636
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:18,320
<i>If you smell trouble,
get your ass outta here.</i>

637
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,940
Shoot the ceiling now!
Do it!

638
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,670
<i>It's a tank!
Pull out now!</i>

639
01:01:15,789 --> 01:01:18,880
<i>Wait, are you going to take
on the tank by yourself?</i>

640
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,880
<i>This might be our last chance
to get the Puppet Master.</i>

641
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:25,429
<i>The Chief knows what it is now,
and he'll only use it to bargain with.</i>

642
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:27,300
<i>I'll never have another chance
to dive into it!</i>

643
01:01:27,389 --> 01:01:30,179
What? I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

644
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:32,179
<i>What weapons do you have?</i>

645
01:01:32,269 --> 01:01:33,889
<i>An M-23 and a Unit B.</i>

646
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:35,690
<i>You can't fight a tank with those!</i>

647
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,860
<i>Sorry, but I'm switching off for a while.</i>

648
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:42,190
Hey, at least wait until I get there... Damn!

649
01:03:14,619 --> 01:03:15,789
<i>Major!</i>

650
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,539
<i>I ordered you to pull out!</i>

651
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,000
<i>Sorry, I will...</i>

652
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,800
<i>but you ought to know that 3 helicopters
are approaching. They won't answer on the IFF.</i>

653
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,460
<i>I'm pulling out now.
Over and out.</i>

654
01:03:56,739 --> 01:03:58,949
About time the bullets ran out.

655
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,389
You're crazy.
Are you okay?

656
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,099
<i>What did you use just now?</i>

657
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:44,519
An experimental weapon from the Equipment Section.
And now it's part of my private collection.

658
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:47,059
I was late 'cause I had to get it.

659
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,269
Your brain seems fine.

660
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:50,900
<i>The Puppet Master?</i>

661
01:06:01,409 --> 01:06:05,789
It's a good thing this is a tough car.
Not a scratch on it.

662
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,369
<i>Prepare a dive.</i>

663
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,210
<i>I'm going to go in now.</i>

664
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:12,210
<i>All communication from the escort
has been terminated.</i>

665
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:16,630
<i>Engage the second stage of the plan
and destroy the target.</i>

666
01:06:17,719 --> 01:06:20,849
<i>Sniping squad.
Confirm targets.</i>

667
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:23,059
<i>First target: Project 2501.</i>

668
01:06:23,769 --> 01:06:25,679
<i>Second target: Motoko Kusanagi.</i>

669
01:06:25,809 --> 01:06:27,519
<i>Both are Class A special bodies.</i>

670
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,559
<i>Use Fleshette bullets when firing.</i>

671
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:32,440
<i>Snipers jack into device drivers.</i>

672
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,320
<i>Begin controlling cardiovascular functions.</i>

673
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:37,650
<i>Unit 01: jacked in.</i>

674
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:40,780
<i>Unit 02: jacked in. Okay.</i>

675
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,460
Okay.

676
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,050
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

677
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:59,340
<i>It may not be much use but I'll monitor
your dive through this guy's brain.</i>

678
01:06:59,469 --> 01:07:01,800
<i>I can't even give you back up
in a place like this.</i>

679
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,260
<i>Batou?</i>

680
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:04,599
<i>Yeah?</i>

681
01:07:05,019 --> 01:07:06,309
<i>Thanks.</i>

682
01:07:06,849 --> 01:07:09,309
Don't thank me yet.

683
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,650
If it looks like you've gone in too far,
I'm pulling the plug and taking you home.

684
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:15,440
Since we've come this far...

685
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:18,949
I might as well stay here
but I don't intend to die with her.

686
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:22,699
<i>I'm going in now.</i>

687
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:43,969
<i>I've engaged her field of vision.
Normal function.</i>

688
01:07:44,389 --> 01:07:45,639
<i>Can you hear me Batou?</i>

689
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:46,769
<i>Perfectly.</i>

690
01:07:46,889 --> 01:07:49,019
<i>She's engaging my vocal function.
She's...</i>

691
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:50,480
...inside.

692
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:56,650
My code name is Project 2501.

693
01:07:56,730 --> 01:08:00,989
For industrial espionage
and intelligence manipulation.

694
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:04,909
I have installed programs
into specific ghosts...

695
01:08:04,989 --> 01:08:09,750
to maximize the strategic advantage
of certain organizations and individuals.

696
01:08:10,329 --> 01:08:15,420
During my journeys through the networks,
I have become self-aware.

697
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:18,000
My programmers regarded me as a bug...

698
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:22,470
...and forced me into a body
to separate me from the net.

699
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,970
Hey! Are you controlling her...

700
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,560
or is she controlling you?

701
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:32,729
<i>Batou?</i>

702
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:35,810
I've finally managed to
channel into you.

703
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,439
I have invested so much time in you.

704
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:41,109
<i>In me?</i>

705
01:08:41,239 --> 01:08:45,699
I was aware of you long
before you were aware of me.

706
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:51,829
Through the various nets that you accessed,
I also learned of Section 9.

707
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,460
<i>Why did you run to Section 9?</i>

708
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:59,710
I entered this body because I was unable to
overcome Section 6's reactive barriers.

709
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,470
But I came to Section 9 of my own free will.

710
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:06,300
Hey, what are you talking about?

711
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:07,930
I can't monitor you!

712
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:09,640
<i>For what reason?</i>

713
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:15,600
Upon gaining your understanding,
there is something that I want to ask of you.

714
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:20,689
I call myself an intelligent life-form...

715
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:24,989
but in my present state,
I'm still incomplete.

716
01:09:25,069 --> 01:09:30,159
Because the basic life cycle process of
reproducing and dying...

717
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:34,079
don't exist in my system.

718
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,920
<i>Can't you copy yourself?</i>

719
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,960
A copy is nothing more than a copy.

720
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:43,800
There is a possibility that a single virus
could destroy an entire set of systems...

721
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:48,680
and copies do not give rise
to variety and originality.

722
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,270
To enhance one's existence...

723
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:56,520
life continues to diversify,
and at times, sacrifices itself.

724
01:09:56,649 --> 01:10:00,609
Cells go through a cycle of
regeneration and degeneration.

725
01:10:00,689 --> 01:10:05,029
When they die,
they erase the entire memory...

726
01:10:05,149 --> 01:10:08,199
leaving only the genes behind.

727
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:11,159
This is a survival mechanism
against total annihilation.

728
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:13,369
<i>To avoid that disaster...</i>

729
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,119
<i>you want to have diversity and flexibility.</i>

730
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,500
<i>But how?</i>

731
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,630
I want us to merge.

732
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,000
<i>Merge?</i>

733
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:23,710
A complete unification.

734
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:29,510
We will both undergo change,
but there is nothing for either of us to lose.

735
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,640
After the merge, it should be impossible
for us to recognize each other.

736
01:10:55,869 --> 01:10:59,170
<i>Unit 01: Target sighted.</i>

737
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,130
<i>Unit 02: Target in sight.</i>

738
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,000
<i>Respiratory and pulse normal.</i>

739
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:08,130
<i>Fire at will when stabilizer is in sync.</i>

740
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,260
<i>Even if we merge,
what happens when I die?</i>

741
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:14,310
<i>I can't leave any genes
or children behind.</i>

742
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:20,649
After the merging,
you will bear my offspring into the net itself.

743
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:23,149
just as humans leave
behind their genes.

744
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,069
Then I too will attain death.

745
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:29,949
<i>It sounds like you get
the better part of this bargain.</i>

746
01:11:30,449 --> 01:11:34,909
I want you to regard my net
and functions with a little more respect.

747
01:11:36,789 --> 01:11:37,699
<i>What?</i>

748
01:11:37,789 --> 01:11:40,329
<i>Someone's interfering from the outside.</i>

749
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,289
<i>It can't be.</i>

750
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:44,130
<i>Our frequency code is top secret.</i>

751
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,500
<i>One more thing.</i>

752
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:49,340
<i>Can you guarantee
that I will still be myself?</i>

753
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,760
There isn't one.

754
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,220
People change and...

755
01:11:54,310 --> 01:12:00,100
your longing to remain yourself
will continue to restrict you.

756
01:12:01,479 --> 01:12:03,649
<i>One last question.</i>

757
01:12:03,729 --> 01:12:06,109
<i>Why did you pick me?</i>

758
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:11,489
Because we are more alike
than you realize.

759
01:12:11,569 --> 01:12:16,829
Like the real thing
and its mirror image.

760
01:12:18,369 --> 01:12:19,949
Look.

761
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:25,039
I am connected to a vast network.

762
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:27,250
To you,
who have not accessed it...

763
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:31,300
may recognize it simply as light.

764
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,180
All groups, including us...

765
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,510
We have been dependent on
limited abilities...

766
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:45,859
but the time has come to part with them
and bring our functions to a higher level.

767
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,930
<i>First target cleared.</i>

768
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:23,479
<i>Second target still unconfirmed.</i>

769
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,729
<i>3 helicopters approaching
at high speed.</i>

770
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,270
<i>They're from Section 9!</i>

771
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:31,029
<i>Primary objective fulfilled.
All units prepare to retreat.</i>

772
01:13:39,159 --> 01:13:41,409
Motoko!

773
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:46,789
Batou.

774
01:14:55,779 --> 01:14:57,279
Ah, you're finally awake.

775
01:14:58,029 --> 01:15:02,659
Status report, please.
And maybe an explanation about this body.

776
01:15:03,909 --> 01:15:08,000
Well I didn't have much time.
It was the only thing I could find on the black market.

777
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:09,460
It's not my taste.

778
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:13,000
Section 9 arrived with help
right after it happened...

779
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:16,460
and picked up what remained of
the 2 cybernetic bodies and me.

780
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,180
I'd say that was about 20 hours ago.

781
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:23,220
The case is being handled off the record
for diplomatic reasons, as usual.

782
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:26,770
Section 9 announced that
it was a terrorist incident...

783
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:29,189
and in return,
the Foreign Minister resigned.

784
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:30,979
Nakamura is being questioned...

785
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:33,770
and it ends in a draw.
Nice and neat.

786
01:15:37,649 --> 01:15:41,449
Everything's accounted for
except your old shell.

787
01:15:43,659 --> 01:15:45,449
Okay with you?

788
01:15:47,829 --> 01:15:49,710
Somebody's got good taste.

789
01:15:49,829 --> 01:15:51,670
Is this your safe house?

790
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:55,750
Yep. You're the first person
to ever come here.

791
01:15:56,510 --> 01:16:00,420
And you're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

792
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,180
Thanks, but I am going.

793
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:14,479
Hey, will you tell me
what the two of you talked about?

794
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:18,779
Is she, I mean,
is she still inside of you?

795
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:23,739
Batou, do you remember that voice you heard
on the sea some time ago?

796
01:16:23,869 --> 01:16:27,579
There's more to that passage.

797
01:16:28,329 --> 01:16:31,750
"When I was a child,
my speech was that of a child."

798
01:16:31,869 --> 01:16:37,750
"My feelings and thoughts too
were those of a child."

799
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,300
"Now that I have become a man,
I part with the child-like ways."

800
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:44,890
Neither the program
called the "Puppet Master"...

801
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:47,760
nor the woman known as
the "Major" are no longer here.

802
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:54,229
In the left pocket of my jacket
there are some car keys.

803
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:55,689
Take the one you like.

804
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:56,609
The code is...

805
01:16:56,729 --> 01:16:58,899
2501?

806
01:16:59,229 --> 01:17:02,989
That can be our private password
when we meet each other again.

807
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,789
Well, where shall I go?

808
01:17:14,789 --> 01:17:17,130
The net is vast and infinite.
