00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:21,678
<i>God, what a mess
on the ladder of success</i>

2
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:27,159
<i>Where you take one step
and miss the whole first rung</i>

3
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:33,792
<i>Dreams unfulfilled graduate unskilled</i>

4
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:39,362
<i>It beats pickin' cotton
and waitin' to be forgotten</i>

5
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:45,901
<i>We are the sons of no one
Bastards of young</i>

6
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:52,441
<i>We are the sons of no one
Bastards of young</i>

7
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,784
<i>The daughters and the sons</i>

8
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,790
Look, I'm going to be paying off
these student loans until, like, 2003.

9
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,393
Hey, you want to get out of here?

10
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,934
-What a rager, huh?
-Yeah. Yeah.

11
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,468
Isn't it weird that all this,

12
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,981
this all happened
at the end of the semester?

13
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:24,414
You and me.

14
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:26,481
James...

15
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:31,381
I don't think I can see you anymore.

16
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:34,691
You don't... What do you mean?

17
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:38,357
Sorry.

18
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:46,671
Women are mercurial, man.

19
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:50,039
-And you did just start dating last week.
-It was 11 days ago.

20
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,374
You didn't tell her about the Scarlet V,
did you?

21
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,381
-That has nothing to do with it.
-Oh, Christ. Brennan.

22
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,576
-What?
-You did! You promised me!

23
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,551
Look, I don't lie to people
who I care about.

24
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:03,316
Yes, but you could've just left it
out of the narrative. You know?

25
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,187
You don't want "virgin"
to be your signifier.

26
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:07,021
He takes one semiotics class,
and I'm supposed to...

27
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:08,117
Here, drink up.

28
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:13,724
You need to bed down the next lonely,
plain-looking, insecure depressive

29
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,098
who throws herself at you
and get it over with.

30
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:18,035
Look, I know most people
have low standards.

31
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,300
I guess I'm... I'm different.

32
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:25,904
Well, you know what,
we'll find you a girl, all right?

33
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,278
-When we're on the Continent.
-Here's to sexually-permissive cultures!

34
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,284
Yes! Focus on Europe.

35
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,582
It's going to be
a transformative experience.

36
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,722
To the graduate.

37
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,887
Yeah, so I researched
some more youth hostels,

38
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,451
and the median cost
is just a little higher than I expected,

39
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,725
about $7.68 more,

40
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,700
multiplied by the 42 days is $322.56.

41
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,759
Bill, do you want to take this?

42
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:54,330
Excuse me, can you get me
a refill here? That's an old-fashioned.

43
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:57,308
So with the $368
I have from Grandpa's trust fund,

44
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,938
plus the $900 you guys
are already giving me, thank you,

45
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,144
I do need an additional $279.11.

46
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:08,714
James, we didn't want
to spoil your graduation,

47
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:14,750
but your father has been transferred
to a different department.

48
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:19,088
Really? Is that... Is that bad?

49
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,432
Yes, we're making less,
considerably less.

50
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,462
Because this trip
was my graduation present, so...

51
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:32,945
Sweetie, I am so sorry about this trip,
but I'm afraid we just can't afford it.

52
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,939
You could still help me
with rent next year, right?

53
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,780
All right, James,
you're not listening to me.

54
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,049
-Here you go, sir.
-There we go. Thank you very much.

55
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:47,116
Listen, here's to you, kiddo.
Happy graduation.

56
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,421
Wait. What am I going to do
about grad school?

57
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,951
You know,
Columbia's holding a spot for me.

58
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,931
Well, if you end up deciding
that's what you want to do,

59
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:56,162
then obviously
you're going to have to get a job.

60
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,828
A summer job?

61
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,430
Summer in Pittsburgh.

62
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,770
-That's fucking harsh.
-It's a nightmare.

63
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,274
They don't like people like me
where I'm from.

64
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,244
You know, we're romantics.
I read poetry for pleasure, sometimes.

65
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,077
Hey, yeah, well, you know what,
don't worry about it, all right?

66
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,915
You know, with my dad's connections,
we'll get a great deal on an apartment.

67
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,479
And, hey,
I'll float you for the first few months.

68
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:17,648
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

69
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,250
-Thank you so much, Eric.
-Hey, don't worry about it.

70
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,022
What the hell are you doing?
Our parents are right over...

71
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,291
What, them? They're clueless.

72
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:29,027
Fuck, this is good weed.

73
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,798
Speaking of which,
I just want you to know

74
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:34,567
that you'll be with me in spirit
this summer.

75
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,733
-Hey, put that away.
-Yeah. Take it.

76
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,833
-No.
-Take it.

77
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:37,900
-Take it!
-Okay.

78
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,812
Look, James,
I know things suck right now, all right?

79
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,212
But look at it this way,

80
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,809
in a few short months,
you'll be with me,

81
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:49,548
in New York City,
the greatest fucking city in the world!

82
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,582
Like we always talked about, man.
Living the adventure together.

83
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,760
Quit worrying, Brennan.
That's what the weed is for.

84
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,562
Bill, for God's sakes, pay attention.

85
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,865
All right, I'm just trying to drive.

86
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:30,421
Here she ever comes now now

87
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:35,230
She ever comes now now
She ever comes now

88
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:38,896
Here she ever comes now now

89
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:43,671
She ever comes now now
She ever comes now

90
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:47,668
Oh, it looks so good

91
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:51,410
She's made out of wood

92
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,544
Just look and see

93
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,288
Here she ever comes now now

94
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:13,294
She ever comes now now
She ever comes now

95
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,934
Here she ever comes now now

96
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:21,675
She ever comes now now
She ever comes now

97
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,707
Oh, it looks so good

98
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:29,209
She's made out of wood

99
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,315
Just look and see

100
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,694
I really haven't had that many jobs,
per se,

101
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,960
but here are my academic records
and my extracurricular activities.

102
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,264
I wrote for The Gordian Knot,
it was a literary journal in college.

103
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,635
And in math, I got 770 on the SATs,

104
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,606
so I assume I'd be good
at tabulating checks.

105
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,370
These are the only jobs
you've ever had?

106
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,673
No, no, I also spent several years

107
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,612
taking care of a neighbor's lawn,
the Palmieris.

108
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,137
I have their
letter of recommendation here.

109
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,343
All right. Fill this out.
I'll call you if anything comes up.

110
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,510
Okay.

111
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,413
No, I've never actually
driven an asphalt mixer, per se,

112
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,516
but I did once drive my friend's van
to Wisconsin

113
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,186
on a pretty lengthy road trip.

114
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:11,993
Yeah, so... Okay, is there any way
I can take a lesson...

115
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,498
They hung up.

116
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:16,126
What am I supposed to do?
I'm not even qualified for manual labor.

117
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,762
The only place I know I can get a job
is with Frigo.

118
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:20,431
What, at Adventureland?

119
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,237
You got a concussion on the
teacup ride there when you were 6.

120
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,368
-You can do better, kiddo.
-No, there's nothing.

121
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,743
I majored in Comparative Literature
and Renaissance Studies.

122
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,714
Unless someone needs help
restoring a fresco, I'm screwed.

123
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,511
Oh, for God's sake, Bill.

124
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,483
-Nad attack!
-Frigo, Frigo! Hey, get off of me.

125
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,926
-Brennan, come here.
-Frigo, stop. Okay.

126
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,589
There's the lawn mower, lawn mower,
lawn mower!

127
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,027
-Yes!
-Frigo.

128
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,034
Oh, Brennan!

129
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:05,347
Right here, sir! Right here, sir!
Have a funtastic time!

130
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,351
I don't have much work experience,
per se, but...

131
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,821
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:15,257
Paulette? Come in, Paulette? Bobby?

133
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,420
Bobby?

134
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,921
-Paulette, come in, Paulette?
-Channels.

135
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:21,159
-You just... You gotta press it.
-Oh, they're gone.

136
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,565
Okay.

137
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,967
This is James,
and he's applying for a games job.

138
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:29,202
Games! Oh, great, good.
Let's get you set up.

139
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:32,005
Actually, Bobby, I'd prefer a rides job,
if it's still open.

140
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,409
You look more like a games guy,

141
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:35,913
plus I've already got out
the games application, so... All right?

142
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,006
Okay. Yeah, no. I just...

143
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,812
My name is Bobby.

144
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:43,879
Okay, rules. No freebies,
no free turns for your friends,

145
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:49,020
-no free upgrades, no free food.
-So, just nothing is free here.

146
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,255
Everybody has to pay for everything.

147
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,594
And more importantly,
working in games,

148
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:55,623
no one ever wins a giant-ass panda.

149
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,226
Yeah, we don't have that many left.

150
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:59,328
Cool? Can you hand me
a T-shirt, please?

151
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:02,966
Here, I have a resume. I don't know
if you still want to take a look at it.

152
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,274
James? Am I pronouncing that right?

153
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,108
-James? James?
-Yeah.

154
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:09,978
Okay, by accepting this T-shirt,
you are...

155
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:11,107
Hired!

156
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,118
Well, usually I...

157
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,177
-More of a ceremonial thing, the T-shirt.
-Sorry.

158
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:18,785
Okay, new guy, let's get this over with.

159
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,730
Here we are
at the first of many shitty games.

160
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:32,495
This one is inexplicably
called The Flighing Dutchman.

161
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,302
Even more inexplicable
is how they decided to spell it.

162
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,200
Hey, Jerry.

163
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,235
$1 buys 5 rings.

164
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,144
If one of the rings lands
on one of the red bottles,

165
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,342
they win a giant-ass panda.

166
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,212
-That is a giant-ass panda.
-Yeah, it's the best prize in the park.

167
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,722
And that's because this game
is un-winnable.

168
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,055
Observe. I'll drop a ring
from 3 inches away.

169
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,061
So nobody ever wins?

170
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,154
If someone wins a giant-ass panda
on your watch,

171
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,461
you should just go home
because you're fired, okay?

172
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,395
So the object of the game

173
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,698
is to knock the hat off the dummy
with a softball,

174
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:09,299
except, as you'll see,
half the hats are glued on.

175
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,232
-Really?
-Yeah.

176
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,870
I mean, we pay little Malaysian kids
10 cents a day to make these toys,

177
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,643
we can't just give them away.

178
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,316
You get a 5-minute bathroom break
every 2 hours.

179
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:23,788
I recommend saving a few of those up
in case you have to go number 2.

180
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:26,484
Brennan, they got you working on games?

181
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,790
What a pussy! You're such a pussy!

182
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:33,958
-You know that demented person?
-Yeah. He used to be my best friend.

183
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,023
Then I turned 4.

184
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,166
So if you stand
directly below the hoop,

185
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:39,932
you will see that it's been hammered
into an oval shape.

186
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,372
But from back there,
the sucker just can't tell.

187
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,638
Jesus, that's so wrong.

188
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,477
A criminal abuse
of the laws of perspective.

189
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,946
Yeah, well,
people are getting ripped off.

190
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,415
Yeah, yeah, Trotsky,
let's get you a booth.

191
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,112
So your life must be utter shit,
or you wouldn't be here.

192
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,245
I was supposed to go to Europe,

193
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,720
but my family has money problems.

194
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:58,882
Wait till your parents start 
making you pay rent.

195
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,449
My dad even makes me pay utilities.

196
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,555
I don't want...

197
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,029
<i>I catch the paper boy</i>

198
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,728
<i>But things don't really change</i>

199
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,929
<i>I'm standing in the wind</i>

200
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,869
<i>But I never wave bye-bye</i>

201
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:20,443
<i>But I try</i>

202
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,571
<i>I try</i>

203
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,278
Hey, litterbug! In the clown mouth!

204
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:33,724
Okay, we have a winner.
It's the purple horse.

205
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,217
Green's in 2nd. Yellow's 3rd.
Congratulations.

206
00:11:37,262 --> 00:11:40,231
Here you go. You can have that.

207
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,062
-Hey, James?
- Yeah?

208
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,430
You think you can maybe, you know,
take it up a notch?

209
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,839
Yeah, I know. Maybe I'm not
the right guy to run this game.

210
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,605
I really... I think I should probably be
on the rides department.

211
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:55,374
No. No, no, no.
You're more of a game guy.

212
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,008
-No, you're very... You're very gamey.
-Yeah.

213
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,244
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

214
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:00,751
Have you ever seen
a horse race before?

215
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,687
Have you ever, like,
heard one on the radio?

216
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,883
Harness racing
or, like, the normal kind?

217
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,518
-That's a good question.
-It doesn't really matter.

218
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,858
Look, the Kentucky Derby.
Have you seen the Kentucky Derby?

219
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,557
The way they announce it on the radio,
and it's really...

220
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,065
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"100, 200, 200, going..."

221
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:16,329
-That's an auction, sweetie.
-Right.

222
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,666
So don't...
Yeah, just get into it, you know?

223
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,036
Make it a show. Make it a performance.
You know what I mean?

224
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,301
That's what people come for.

225
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,538
So, let's take it to a 10.
All right, got faith in you, man.

226
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,476
Thank you.

227
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,175
-Take it to a 10. I like that.
-Okay.

228
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,350
Ladies and gentlemen,
put down your mint juleps.

229
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,947
Horses are all at the starting gate.

230
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,321
Okay, and they're off!

231
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,385
And Red bolts out of the gate,
taking an early lead!

232
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,589
But look out! Here comes Green,

233
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,723
issuing a challenge
from the outside lane.

234
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,426
Green runs well
on a muddy track, folks,

235
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,129
so today's conditions
give him a slight edge.

236
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,637
And Yellow is dead last!

237
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:56,471
What a disappointment after Yellow's
strong showing at Saratoga last spring.

238
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:57,998
Wait! Look out! Wait a second!

239
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,840
Out of nowhere,
Orange breaks ahead of the pack,

240
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:01,539
and now, in the backstretch,
Orange and Green.

241
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,878
Orange and Green,
and Orange takes it by a nose!

242
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,281
Green places and Red shows.

243
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,478
Please come to the window
to collect your winnings!

244
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,480
-What window? There's a window?
-No. No, there's not. Here you go.

245
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,125
Congratulations, sir.

246
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:27,963
I'm new.

247
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,802
Our original initiative rapidly got
all tangled up in the sale of arms.

248
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,676
And the sale of arms got tangled up...

249
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,708
Hey, why don't you call
one of your old friends?

250
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:42,879
I heard Danny's back in town. Or Pat?

251
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,223
And tell them I work as a carny?
No, thank you.

252
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,487
-Yo! Guy!
-Yeah?

253
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,327
-Give me five.
-Okay.

254
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:59,465
Hey, I heard some big fat lady
fell off the Paratrooper.

255
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,632
Oh, really? I didn't hear about that.
Was she okay?

256
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:05,336
I don't know.
Hey, you know what? Give me 10.

257
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,676
-Okay.
-You know what? Make it 15.

258
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:13,378
Yeah, I heard she was this
big, fat, slob of a woman, you know?

259
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:17,252
Hey, he won! Check it out!
Way to go, Dom! Way to go, Dom!

260
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,189
-We got a winner!
-Come on, check it out!

261
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:23,183
Okay, sir, actually,
I saw you holding him over the bottles.

262
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:24,286
That's cheating.

263
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:27,492
Oh, no. He won fair-and-square, sir.
You know, you gotta give him a prize!

264
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,331
-Yeah, I saw him throw it!
-Hey, thank you, sir.

265
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:35,898
-Guys, hey, fellas, I could lose my job.
-This faggot's trying to rip off a kid!

266
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,510
Why don't you give the kid
a fucking panda.

267
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,082
Here you go, here's your panda.

268
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:49,053
Yeah, thanks. Here you go, Dom.
I mean, he's just a little kid.

269
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,848
Look, am I gonna get in trouble?

270
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,983
No one's ever supposed
to lose a giant-ass panda.

271
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,187
Is it worth getting knifed over?

272
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,422
No.

273
00:14:57,462 --> 00:15:02,263
-Hi. I'm James Brennan. I just started.
-Em. Nice to meet you.

274
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,129
Sucks you're gonna lose your job
your second day, James.

275
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:10,532
No. Shit. I need this job.

276
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,202
I'm kidding. You're okay.

277
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,373
I'll tell Bobby you lost the panda
at knifepoint.

278
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,748
Yo, Connell! Rock on!

279
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,550
-Who's that?
-Connell. He's the maintenance guy.

280
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,794
Hey, Joel, is that a pipe?

281
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:37,561
Yeah, I know.

282
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,039
It's a revolting affectation,
but it relaxes me.

283
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,065
-Hey, Joel. Hey.
-Hi.

284
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,376
You guys want some of this?

285
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:49,505
-I bagged it from Paulette. Cuban rum?
-Thanks.

286
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,550
I think somebody was trying
to write "Satan Lives" on that wall,

287
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,751
but they spelled it "Satin Lives."

288
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,158
One of those textile-worshipping cults,
no doubt.

289
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,627
-That's quite funny.
-Yeah.

290
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,962
Lou Reed? I like the tee, Em.

291
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,491
You know
about Connell and Lou, right?

292
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:12,765
No, I don't know about them.

293
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,032
Time out, guys.

294
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:15,539
-Guys, he doesn't know the legend.
-Oh, my God!

295
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,270
-Tell him.
-Connell once jammed with Lou Reed.

296
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,868
-Really?
-The historic Lou Reed.

297
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,539
-The Lou Reed.
-So Connell's like a real musician?

298
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:26,483
Yeah, he's got his own band.
It's frigging awesome.

299
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,681
-He's gotta get a lot of pussy with it.
-He's married, you perv!

300
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,655
Nice pipe, Grandpa!

301
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:36,055
Oh, my God.
That was a whole corn dog!

302
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:38,460
I'm sorry, Joel.
My brother is such a douche.

303
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,361
Looks like it's us!
Let's go, panty stain!

304
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,528
"Panty stain," that's me.
Good night, everybody.

305
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:47,003
Hey, I could give you a ride,
if you want.

306
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,906
Really? Frigo, I got a ride. Really?

307
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:50,999
-What?
-Yeah.

308
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,408
-Thank you so much. I got a ride.
-Hey, what?

309
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,309
You can go. Good night.

310
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,938
-You got a ride?
-Yes.

311
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,144
All right, then.
Then why don't you ride this?

312
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,414
-Oh, my God.
-Frigo.

313
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,717
-All right, I'll see you, Brennan.
-What the hell was that?

314
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:05,450
It's just my life.

315
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,103
<i>I'm curious to know
exactly how you are</i>

316
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:30,877
<i>I keep my distance
But that distance is too far</i>

317
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:36,081
<i>It reassures me just to know
that you're okay</i>

318
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:40,649
<i>But I don't want you to go on
needing me this way</i>

319
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:45,527
<i>And I don't want to know
if you are lonely</i>

320
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,027
-Here, have some rum.
-Thanks.

321
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:52,332
Oh, shit.
Sorry, my mother. She's very nosy.

322
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:57,232
Yeah, she used to read my journals.
I had to start writing them in Italian.

323
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:59,209
I took Italian for a year.
I went through an opera...

324
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,734
Okay, she's gone.

325
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:06,247
So, Joel told me that you're gonna go
to Columbia for grad school.

326
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:10,448
-Yeah.
-Wow. I'm at NYU right now.

327
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,480
Oh, really? Oh, that's cool.

328
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:15,583
Maybe I'll run into you
on the streets of NYC.

329
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,424
-What are you studying?
-Journalism.

330
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:21,830
Yeah, I want to be, like,
a travel essayist.

331
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,165
But I want to report
on the real state of the world.

332
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:25,863
You know, like Charles Dickens,

333
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,531
for example, wrote
what you might call travel books,

334
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:30,405
but he visited prisons
and mental asylums.

335
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:34,840
-That's cool.
-Yeah, is it?

336
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,313
-Yeah.
-Okay.

337
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,508
No, it is, it's...

338
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,245
But why do you have to
go to grad school for that?

339
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,021
No, that's a valid question,

340
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:47,889
but, actually, journalism is kind of
like this old boys' network still.

341
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,293
You need the right connections.
It's very Ivy League, very exclusive.

342
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:56,596
Stupid. I think my mother would rather
I intern at some Fortune 500 company

343
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,830
or something like that.

344
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,861
-Fuck that, right?
-Yeah.

345
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,534
Yeah.

346
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,939
I got to go. I have to meet a friend.

347
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,710
-Okay. Yeah, thanks for the ride.
-Sure.

348
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:49,515
Hey, I heard you jammed
with Lou Reed.

349
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:52,387
-Don't believe everything you hear.
-Okay.

350
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,892
I'll tell you about it sometime.

351
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,995
So, where does your band play?

352
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,898
Usual shitholes around town.
I need better musicians.

353
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,599
-I'm starting a new band out in LA.
-Los Angeles?

354
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,732
Yeah. It's going to be cool.
Going this winter.

355
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:12,933
-Jesus.
-Nasty.

356
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,137
You'll get better at avoiding that.

357
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:24,781
Hey, guys. Party at my house tonight.
My dad's out of town.

358
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,852
I'm invited?

359
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,054
Yep, that's why I'm telling you.

360
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,962
-Connell?
-You kiddies have fun.

361
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,497
She's cool, right?

362
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,864
You're just smearing that around.

363
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,735
Hey, Sue, I'm a virgin at table games,
so go easy on me.

364
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,338
We're having a ping-pong tournament!

365
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:51,107
-Hey.
-Hey.

366
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,411
Nice digs.

367
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,977
Kind of begs the question of why the
hell you're working at Adventureland?

368
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,717
Well, you know, my dad's a lawyer.

369
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,488
It's been his life-long dream for
his daughter to work at Adventureland.

370
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,462
-High hopes.
-Also gets me out of the house.

371
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,656
So we can drink your parents' booze.
It's okay?

372
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,190
-Absolutely.
-Yes!

373
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,760
-Awesome.
-Don't touch me.

374
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,932
Hey, I actually brought something
for the party.

375
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,103
-What is that?
-It's a joint.

376
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,739
-Oh.
-Yeah.

377
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,449
Bobby is weird.

378
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:28,679
I had to go back and get the extra
employee key for the bathroom,

379
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,654
and I went back, I opened the door,

380
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:35,319
and there were all these pictures
of him and Paulette, naked.

381
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,259
What a weirdo.

382
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:47,093
Hey, I'm gonna go for a swim.
Anybody care to join me?

383
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:53,369
Okay.

384
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:00,045
Come on.

385
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,282
Is anybody else coming in here,
or is it just us?

386
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,155
Yeah, okay.

387
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,191
-See, it's not so bad. It's okay.
-No, it's okay.

388
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,340
-Do you have any more of that pot?
-Yeah, at home. Why?

389
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,516
-We should make pot cookies.
-Okay.

390
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:36,111
That would be so fun.
Have you done that?

391
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:39,214
-I have not. I've had cookies.
-All right.

392
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,350
My connections have all dried up.
That's why I'm asking.

393
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,690
Your connections have dried up?

394
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:44,661
What, you think, I have ties
to the underworld or something?

395
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,856
I have 5 joints.

396
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,055
You think I can, like,
put a hit out on somebody?

397
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:49,123
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

398
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:58,932
Oh, my God!

399
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:04,807
I got you. I got the door.
It's only 3 feet, so I can handle it.

400
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:06,609
Okay.

401
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,648
-I'm gonna get a drink.
-Okay.

402
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,181
You want one?

403
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,091
-Coming?
-Yeah.

404
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,500
Yeah, I'll meet you inside.

405
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,302
-Okay.
-I'll meet you inside.

406
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:34,777
-Okay.
-Okay.

407
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:37,742
Shit.

408
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:44,748
Boner! You got a boner!
Brennan's got a boner!

409
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:47,249
Yeah!

410
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,054
Thanks.

411
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:57,030
I like your records.
Eno, Replacements, Big Star.

412
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:01,368
Hey, give me your underwear.
I'll throw them in the dryer for you.

413
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,872
-I promise you'll get them back.
-Yeah.

414
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:11,345
Thank you.

415
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:24,360
-Who's that?
-It's my stepmom.

416
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,799
I don't think there's any pictures
of my mom in here.

417
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:35,397
-She died 2 years ago.
-Really? I'm sorry.

418
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,908
My dad remarried last year.
That's Francy.

419
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,379
You see that unholy abomination
on her head?

420
00:24:43,414 --> 00:24:44,847
-Yeah.
-It's a wig.

421
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,077
Is it?

422
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:51,885
She had, like, a nervous breakdown
when her first husband divorced her.

423
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,686
Lost all her hair.

424
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,785
I would feel bad if she wasn't
such a status-obsessed witch.

425
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:04,464
-I'm buzzed. You?
-Yeah, kind of.

426
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,313
-What was that?
-What was what?

427
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:22,814
I'm gonna go...
You want to go see what they're doing?

428
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,946
Yes.

429
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,728
I think I drank, like,
a whole bottle of vodka.

430
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,231
You were drinking vermouth
the whole night, it's disgusting.

431
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:36,392
Yeah, it's a type of vodka.

432
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:43,400
You okay? Frigo? What are you doing?

433
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,602
Okay, good night!

434
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,779
Hello?

435
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:01,417
Hey. No, actually,
the party broke up pretty early.

436
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:12,735
I'm in here.

437
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,034
<i>Crack of dawn</i>

438
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,967
<i>Cindy's movin' on</i>

439
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,314
<i>She's talking Cindy to everyone</i>

440
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:33,649
-So we have, like, 5 minutes?
-No.

441
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:36,159
<i>Though I've heard it before</i>

442
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,096
There's not much point
in wasting time, though.

443
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:44,932
<i>But I just can't get away</i>

444
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:49,372
<i>Cindy kills me every day</i>

445
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:27,404
Lisa P. is back!

446
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,675
-Lisa P. is back!
-Lisa P.? Did you hear that?

447
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,877
Lisa P. is back! Lisa P. is back!

448
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,015
-Brennan, Brennan, Lisa P. is back!
-Yeah? Who's Lisa P.?

449
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,990
Holy mother of crap!
"Who's Lisa P.?"

450
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:41,218
That's Lisa P.

451
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,320
Come on, come on

452
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:52,663
Have you ever heard
those opening lines

453
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:59,335
You should leave this small town
way behind

454
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:04,508
I'll be your partner
Show you the steps

455
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:11,388
Oh, my God,
look at the shape of her ass.

456
00:28:11,422 --> 00:28:14,619
It's a platonic ideal.
That ass is a higher truth.

457
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:19,255
Look, look at that little portal of light,
just below her crotch,

458
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,026
right where the thigh
meets the pudendum.

459
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:23,590
The pudendum? Are you pre-med?

460
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:27,161
I'm telling you, man, I've had dreams
about that diamond-shape portal.

461
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,934
She's coming over here, man. Be cool.

462
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,237
Okay, I'll try to hold it together.

463
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:33,937
-Hey, Lisa. Hey, Kelly.
-Hey, Joel.

464
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,446
So, I didn't expect you to be back here.

465
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,382
Oh, man, I had my whole summer, like,
mapped out.

466
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,477
Laying out by the pool by day,
dancing by night.

467
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,480
But my dad got injured on the job,
and he's laid up, so I got to help out.

468
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:50,255
Sorry to hear that.
My mom has shingles.

469
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:52,921
Oh.

470
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,660
Well, I gotta go run the Musik-Express.

471
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,796
I don't want Paulette bitching me out
on my first day.

472
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:01,998
-I'm Lisa.
-James.

473
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,237
I heard you lost a giant-ass
panda at knifepoint.

474
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,734
Did you?
I guess my legend precedes me.

475
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,181
-What?
-It was nice to meet you.

476
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:14,377
Nice to meet you, too, James.

477
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,218
Bye, Lisa. Bye, Kelly.

478
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:21,319
A little more than 40%
of these fish are dead.

479
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,224
I am amazed
at how tiny my paycheck is,

480
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,819
after working doubles.

481
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:28,263
Well, we are doing the work of pathetic,
lazy morons.

482
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,430
Jesus fucking Christ, they play
this song, like, 20 times a day.

483
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,496
Fucking sadists. Fucking sadists!

484
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,268
Hey.

485
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,337
-Hey.
-Hey, I made you a tape.

486
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,746
These are my favorite bummer songs.

487
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:47,250
They're truly miserable,
pit-of-despair type songs.

488
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,809
-I think you'll love it.
-Cool.

489
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,185
Yeah. Hey, you want to get a drink
or something?

490
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,348
Sure.

491
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,830
<i>I got a fever of 103</i>

492
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:08,498
Come on, baby
Do you do more than dance?

493
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:11,372
<i>I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded</i>

494
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:28,382
-Hey, I feel like I should tell you.
-Tell me what?

495
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:33,127
Yeah. I had my heart broken recently.

496
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:38,099
Is that... I don't know,
I just thought I should tell you.

497
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:40,195
-That sucks.
-Yeah.

498
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:43,105
-Who broke your heart?
-A girl at school.

499
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,474
Yeah, it's typical.
I actually... I think there was...

500
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,569
I think there was something there.

501
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,273
I think that we actually had,
like, potential.

502
00:30:49,313 --> 00:30:52,248
I don't know. I think she was afraid.

503
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:54,775
Afraid of what?

504
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,310
I don't know.
Afraid of it being good or something.

505
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,016
Was the sex good?

506
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,149
She was very sexy.

507
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,559
You've been with a lot of girls?

508
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:09,923
Yep. Are we talking about, like,
intercourse specifically?

509
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,793
Yeah.

510
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:15,600
No, in that case,

511
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,108
there were actually a few times that I...

512
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,439
Yeah, a few times I could've done that.

513
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,378
But it wasn't... It wasn't exactly right.

514
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,473
Wait, so you're telling me
you're a virgin?

515
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:28,314
-There were circumstances...
-Oh, my God!

516
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:29,580
-Oh, my God.
-No, I went...

517
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,080
Okay, all right, for example, junior year,
I was dating this girl, Betsy Cooke.

518
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:38,255
Betsy was kind of, like...
She was kind of a prude, actually.

519
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,526
Anyway, one day,
I was reading Shakespeare,

520
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:45,867
and I realized I don't really love
this person. You know?

521
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:48,371
It was one of the sonnets.

522
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,533
"Being your slave, what should I do

523
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,341
"but tend upon the hours
and times of your desires?"

524
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:59,441
And I realized I don't want to tend
to Betsy's hours or her times.

525
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:00,916
All right, that doesn't matter.

526
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,115
Anyway, I drove to Betsy's house,
and I was literally about to tell her,

527
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,123
and that's the night
she said she wanted to have sex.

528
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:09,092
Can you believe it? It was the same...
You know, it was the same night, so...

529
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:11,686
And you didn't just fuck her anyway?

530
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,757
No.

531
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:23,204
So what about you and intercourse?

532
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,369
-Can you stop saying "intercourse"?
-Sure, sure.

533
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,037
I don't know.
There were guys in high school,

534
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,742
and then, like, there were other ones.

535
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,347
-Were you in love with any of them?
-No. Hell no.

536
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,279
Got you.

537
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:42,385
Oh, hey, it's Connell. Hey, Connell!

538
00:32:42,426 --> 00:32:44,394
-Jimbo.
-Hey, you know this place?

539
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:47,727
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everybody knows this is my joint.

540
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,194
These guys work at the park.
This is Ronnie.

541
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,226
Nice to meet you.

542
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,000
-Hi.
-Hey.

543
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,530
We're gonna go meet some friends
in the back.

544
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:58,701
Cool.

545
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:02,744
Do it! My nephew!

546
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:10,551
Is that Connell's wife?
She's, like, really pretty.

547
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,078
Yeah, she is.

548
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,487
She works
at that lame disco, Razzmatazz.

549
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:20,163
-It's kind of sad.
-Oh, yeah? I've never been there.

550
00:33:20,197 --> 00:33:24,497
No, I mean their marriage is sad.
He didn't want it. Now he's trapped.

551
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:34,006
Are you sure you want to go?
The band is really awful.

552
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,605
-Yeah, I just needed some air.
-Okay.

553
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:49,488
<i>Sometimes I feel so happy</i>

554
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:55,260
<i>Sometimes I feel so sad</i>

555
00:33:57,768 --> 00:34:00,931
<i>Sometimes I feel so happy</i>

556
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:05,831
<i>But mostly you just make me mad</i>

557
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,776
<i>Baby, you just make me mad</i>

558
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:19,580
<i>Linger on</i>

559
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,888
<i>Your pale blue eyes</i>

560
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:30,859
<i>Linger on</i>

561
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,300
-Hey, can we go somewhere?
-Yeah.

562
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,276
<i>Thought of you as my mountain top</i>

563
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:50,284
<i>Thought of you as my peak</i>

564
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,986
<i>Thought of you as everything</i>

565
00:34:58,095 --> 00:35:00,962
<i>I've had but couldn't keep</i>

566
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,260
Hey.

567
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:15,406
<i>Linger on</i>

568
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,872
<i>Your pale blue eyes</i>

569
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,020
-You made out with her?
-Yeah. Yeah, I just kissed her.

570
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,291
I don't know what came over me.
It was incredible.

571
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:37,461
Cool, man. How was that?

572
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:42,638
Fantastic. Joel, she's like...
She's, like, perfect, you know?

573
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,267
-Good for you, man.
-Yeah.

574
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,243
I got to open my booth.

575
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,921
Hey, do you have an ice-pick
I can jam into my ears?

576
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,620
I can't listen to this song again.

577
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:08,030
I don't, but I have this.

578
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,201
-Be cool with that.
-Okay. Thanks.

579
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:19,439
-Were you on a date last night?
-I wouldn't call it a date.

580
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,910
Not into Em?

581
00:36:22,112 --> 00:36:24,137
No, she's great. She's great. I just...

582
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:25,443
I don't know
if I'm ready for a girlfriend yet.

583
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,247
I'm kind of getting over a broken heart.

584
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:32,388
-I hope you didn't tell her that.
-Why?

585
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:36,589
You told her that, didn't you?

586
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,721
James, no girl wants to hear about
some other chick you're hard up for.

587
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:43,062
-Right. They don't?
-They don't.

588
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,035
Look, I'm not saying
never be vulnerable with a girl.

589
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,005
I'm just saying don't play that card first.

590
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,041
Wait, it's a card? Like a card?

591
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:57,737
There's a science to it.
You're probably pretty good at science.

592
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,577
-That works now.
-Yeah. Okay.

593
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:05,619
Okay, observe. 2 options.

594
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:09,254
I can play it safe,
pick them off from back here,

595
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:12,820
or I can rush into the breach,
guns a-blazing.

596
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:16,321
Make a run right at the cortex,
and bombs away.

597
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,172
Fortune favors the bold. Virgil said that.

598
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:27,610
I'm sure Virgil had Bionic Mutant
in mind. I'm gonna go punch out.

599
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:30,307
-All right, bye.
-Your turn, man.

600
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:32,372
Okay, but I'm probably not gonna
be very good at this.

601
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,510
Hey.

602
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,246
I really want to see you tonight.

603
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,486
-Tonight?
-Yeah.

604
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,188
Unless you got something else
going on.

605
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,722
You're doing really good.

606
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,531
I jump when he jumps
just instinctively.

607
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,370
Where? Where do you wanna go?
Not the backseat of your car.

608
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,307
We can go to my mom's.

609
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:06,741
-Hey, James?
-Yeah?

610
00:38:09,386 --> 00:38:12,287
Whoa, bonus round. Kudos.

611
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,792
I heard you might have some weed.

612
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:20,290
Yeah, I have a stash.
Why, you like the ganja?

613
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,898
Sometimes.

614
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,029
Beer?

615
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,806
-Got anything stronger?
-Yeah.

616
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,541
So what excuse
do you give your mother

617
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,813
for coming down here so late?

618
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,154
Gotta pump some midnight iron?

619
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,559
Sometimes I come here to practice.
Give Ronnie a break.

620
00:38:53,163 --> 00:38:56,360
You still hot for your wife?
What's the sex like?

621
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,468
Why? Why would you...
Why would you say that?

622
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:04,338
-Don't be mean.
-Jeez, you're sensitive.

623
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:09,176
No, I'm serious. When we're together,
we're good to each other.

624
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,543
Let's not ruin it.

625
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:15,878
Okay.

626
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,254
So, how's your dad?

627
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:26,529
Since he can't work,
he's been so fucked up.

628
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:31,758
Yeah. Stays in bed a lot.
Won't see anyone.

629
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,704
-Men are prideful creatures.
-Exactly.

630
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,511
Do you believe in God?

631
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:48,248
Wow, theology doesn't come up
a lot around here.

632
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,617
Yeah, but you see someone you love
in pain,

633
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,281
you sort of think
about that kind of stuff.

634
00:39:52,322 --> 00:39:54,017
I believe in love.

635
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,622
I mean,
I think that love is very transferable,

636
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:02,154
I mean, transformable.

637
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,430
I think that love
makes things transform together.

638
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:09,799
I'm majorly high.

639
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,342
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Yeah, me, too.

640
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,876
I'm having dinner with my parents.

641
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,676
Somebody's hungry.

642
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,689
James, I read
that Pitt has some journalism courses.

643
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,782
-Is that so?
-Oh, yeah?

644
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,388
Yeah, I was just thinking that,

645
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,294
you know, it might make 
fiscal sense for you

646
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:37,596
to stay close to home for a while.

647
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:41,536
And they have these broadcasting
internships on Mister Rogers'.

648
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:45,235
I get to intern on a kids' show
with marionettes.

649
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:47,766
Mom, I thought you wanted me to go
to an Ivy League school,

650
00:40:47,811 --> 00:40:49,142
like the one I've been accepted to.

651
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:51,943
I am... I am just trying to be pragmatic.

652
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:57,079
They're hand puppets,
not marionettes, on Mister Rogers'.

653
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:01,287
You know, like,
"Royal greetings, I am King Friday."

654
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,688
That's a terrible impression.

655
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,355
James, what is wrong with you?

656
00:41:06,663 --> 00:41:12,568
We, the people, in order to have
a more perfect union, say, "Let's party!"

657
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,970
Hey! Jugglers, fireworks!

658
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:19,874
Mr. Fabulous' Incredible
Performing Canines tonight!

659
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:23,311
Hey, kid. In the clown mouth.
Come on.

660
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,872
-Be a pal. Thanks, buddy.
-Eat it!

661
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:28,246
Son of a bitch!

662
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,914
Get him! Get him!

663
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,856
-Come here.
-Be careful.

664
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,551
All right! Hey!

665
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:40,690
Oh, my God!

666
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:44,196
I don't even celebrate July 4th,
you know? I celebrate Bastille Day.

667
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:46,964
That's why Bastille Day
is gonna be a blast for me.

668
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:55,774
<i>There is freedom within</i>

669
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,872
<i>There is freedom without</i>

670
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,851
<i>Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup</i>

671
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:07,490
<i>There's a battle ahead</i>

672
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:09,822
<i>Many battles are lost</i>

673
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,987
<i>But you'll never see the end of the road</i>

674
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,658
<i>While you're traveling with me</i>

675
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,826
<i>Hey now, hey now</i>

676
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,860
<i>Don't dream it's over</i>

677
00:42:20,904 --> 00:42:23,805
<i>Hey now, hey now</i>

678
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,833
<i>When the world comes in</i>

679
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,335
<i>They come, they come</i>

680
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,543
<i>To build a wall between us</i>

681
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:36,382
<i>We know they won't win</i>

682
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:42,452
-Park's closed, Em.
-Yeah.

683
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:45,188
-Rich, you scared the hell out of us.
-Rich, it's me, James.

684
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,823
-Park's closed, James.
-Okay, we'll leave soon, okay?

685
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,526
Better leave now. The park's closed.

686
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:51,727
-All right, we better leave now.
-Okay. Here we go.

687
00:42:51,768 --> 00:42:53,497
Okay. Thanks, Rich.

688
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:56,335
Don't dream it's over

689
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,274
Hey now, hey now

690
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:02,301
When the world comes in

691
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,372
They come, they come

692
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:08,878
I think you're so beautiful.

693
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,551
Oh, fuck.

694
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:19,659
-Hey, kids!
-Hey, hey. Hey, what's going on?

695
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:23,188
-It's my friend James, Dad.
-Hi. Nice to meet you, sir.

696
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,834
-Nice to meet you, James.
-You, too.

697
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:31,272
-Hi, James. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

698
00:43:32,075 --> 00:43:35,238
Well, I'm gonna go do some work
before bed.

699
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,246
-Good night.
-Good night.

700
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,842
-Good night.
-Good night, party pooper.

701
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:47,421
So, it was a lovely party
at the Melnicks'.

702
00:43:47,457 --> 00:43:49,789
And, you know,
their daughter Lori is lovely.

703
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:53,227
Now, she said you two
used to be best friends.

704
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:56,357
She used to sleep over in,
like, junior high.

705
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,392
Did you know that she is at law school
at Northwestern?

706
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,664
Lori Melnick,

707
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,542
she once violated our cat Gypsy
with a ballpoint pen.

708
00:44:08,578 --> 00:44:11,706
All right, Emily!
That's enough, young lady.

709
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,974
See you later.

710
00:44:15,852 --> 00:44:17,251
Sy.

711
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,499
I can't believe
my dad wants to be with that.

712
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,136
Do you want to hear
something fucked up?

713
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,299
What?

714
00:44:39,142 --> 00:44:42,475
When my mom first started getting,
like, really sick,

715
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,175
my dad starts going to temple.

716
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,912
He's never been serious about his faith.

717
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:54,356
But he decided to buddy up to God,

718
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:57,952
like he thought
it was going to help save my mom.

719
00:44:58,428 --> 00:45:00,191
And that's where he met Francy.

720
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:06,966
My mom loses her hair in chemo,

721
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,667
and my dad starts fucking
a bald woman.

722
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,669
It's just weird.

723
00:45:19,082 --> 00:45:20,845
I'll take you home.

724
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:31,154
We started dancing
and love put us into a groove

725
00:45:31,194 --> 00:45:34,925
As soon as we started to move

726
00:45:38,101 --> 00:45:43,437
The music played while our bodies
displayed for the dance

727
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:46,203
It's nice when Paulette's got the day off.

728
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,143
Put that disco station on.

729
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,680
Hey, you know,
I'm a one-man woman, so...

730
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:03,557
-Hey, Bobby. I'm on break.
-All right, let's see how you did.

731
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,734
Hey, babe. How's it... Hello?

732
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,032
Yeah, he's right here.

733
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:16,232
It's your mother.

734
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:19,802
Sorry.

735
00:46:20,877 --> 00:46:24,779
Hi, Ma. No, Ma, that's the pilot light.

736
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,339
It's supposed to be on.

737
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,349
No, the place is not going to blow. Ma?

738
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,315
I'll be right there.

739
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,249
I gotta go.

740
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,488
-Jimbo, can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

741
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:42,262
You got one of those
little baby joints on you?

742
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,891
-I do.
-Let's go.

743
00:46:56,813 --> 00:47:01,375
-Is your mom okay?
-Yeah, she's a little dramatic, my mom.

744
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:04,080
Kind of nutty since my dad skipped out.

745
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,555
Where'd he go?

746
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,558
I don't know. He left a long time ago.

747
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,584
-This is cool.
-Yeah, Lou Reed.

748
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,529
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Satellite Of Love.

749
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:16,361
Of course. Right on.

750
00:47:19,936 --> 00:47:24,066
You gotta tell me your Lou Reed story.
He's like a real hero to me.

751
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:30,506
-Hey, man, how's it going with Em?
-I don't know. It's going...

752
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,611
She's...

753
00:47:35,785 --> 00:47:38,015
I think I'm in love with her.

754
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:40,186
<i>Soon it will be filled</i>

755
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:42,623
<i>With parking cars</i>

756
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,797
<i>I watch it for a little while</i>

757
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:51,323
<i>I love to watch things on TV</i>

758
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:55,202
This will just take a second,
Jimbo. Don't finish that joint.

759
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:59,041
<i>Satellite of love</i>

760
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,102
<i>Satellite of love</i>

761
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,882
<i>Satellite of love</i>

762
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:08,909
Hey.

763
00:48:11,087 --> 00:48:12,816
I was hanging out
with your boyfriend earlier.

764
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,416
-He's in love with you.
-What?

765
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:20,086
He said, I quote,
"I think I'm in love with her."

766
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,494
Right.

767
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,010
Hey, are you going
to Razzmatazz tonight?

768
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:37,605
It's 2-for-Tuesday.
You get 2 for the price of one.

769
00:48:38,014 --> 00:48:40,847
I want action tonight

770
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:44,081
Satisfaction all night

771
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,793
I grab my hat and I grab my shoes

772
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,924
Tonight I'm gonna
hit the streets and cruise

773
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,097
You have to do something!

774
00:49:02,138 --> 00:49:03,196
You're not doing anything!

775
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,435
I can't take it anymore!

776
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,376
Maybe she needs to see 
Dr. Schacter again.

777
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:09,878
You have to do something, okay?

778
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:11,107
Something has to change.

779
00:49:11,147 --> 00:49:14,810
You know she works at that park,
that trashy park, just to embarrass us!

780
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:20,914
You're coming through

781
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:23,221
Seems just like a dream

782
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,787
It's a mystery to me

783
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,855
Fills me within

784
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:31,492
When we're together

785
00:49:31,534 --> 00:49:34,833
Oh, baby, can't you see

786
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:39,205
I like to feel the passion

787
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:42,939
To the point of no return

788
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,879
What are you majoring in?

789
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:50,044
Russian Literature
and Slavic Languages.

790
00:49:50,086 --> 00:49:54,455
-Oh, wow, that's really interesting.
-Yeah.

791
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,289
What career track is that?

792
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,626
Cabbie, hot-dog vendor,
marijuana delivery guy.

793
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,598
The world is my oyster.

794
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,000
You kids need another round?

795
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,232
-Thanks, Ronnie, we're fine.
-Actually, we'll take 2 more.

796
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:12,708
I'll have 2. Joel, you can have 1.

797
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:16,237
-What the hell? Are you gonna stop?
-2-for-Tuesday.

798
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:21,609
Em, I love this song!
Come on, let's dance! Let's dance.

799
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,955
Come on. Come on.

800
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,048
-Come on.
-Okay.

801
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,588
You are an obsession

802
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,599
Here, ready? Stay with me.

803
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,962
Unopened at your feet

804
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:41,527
There's no balance

805
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,673
-You like that?
-Yes.

806
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,268
Marcy Feingold, ninth grade,
taught me that one.

807
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,301
-Good one!
-Thanks a lot.

808
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,977
-Nice moves, Brennan.
-Thanks.

809
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:59,748
-Razzmatazz!
-Come on, Razzmatazz, we're hungry.

810
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,691
-But we love you more!
-It knows.

811
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,854
More.

812
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,255
Oh, my God. You okay?

813
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,135
-Razzmatazz.
-Come on.

814
00:51:14,637 --> 00:51:15,661
All right.

815
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:19,466
-There you go.
-You're so strong-ish.

816
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,468
I'll take that.

817
00:51:27,283 --> 00:51:29,808
I'm so surprised
I'm making out with you.

818
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,081
Me, too.

819
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:44,559
Em, I think you're incredible.

820
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:52,006
Hey, there's a lot of shit in my life.

821
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,409
I'm not ready for this.
I need to take things slow.

822
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,574
Okay, all right.

823
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:04,017
I'm sorry.

824
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:19,332
Hey. Let me help you with that.

825
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,701
I got it.

826
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,201
That is ugly.

827
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,700
Thanks.

828
00:52:28,878 --> 00:52:31,369
-Hey, so how's your dad?
-He's hanging in there.

829
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:35,612
-Yeah? Still... Still not working?
-No, no.

830
00:52:37,086 --> 00:52:40,419
The Musik-Express!

831
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:44,689
-These rides are safe, right?
-Supposedly.

832
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,588
I wouldn't mess around on any of them.

833
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:51,794
Last summer, there was this drunk idiot
goofing around on the Comet Booster,

834
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,769
trying to kick his buddy.

835
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:57,830
They found his Reebok
in the parking lot, with his foot in it.

836
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:01,970
-Yo, Lisa. We're partners today.
-Great.

837
00:53:03,746 --> 00:53:05,145
So it's official.

838
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,648
My friend Boomer
hooked me up with a job

839
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,617
at the Mercedes dealership
on Route 30.

840
00:53:08,651 --> 00:53:12,519
Yeah, I'm getting a car right away.
Payments deducted from my check.

841
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:18,120
Yeah, I'm gonna go for a 560,
convertible, in gold, leather interior.

842
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,356
I'm even gonna get
a compact disc player.

843
00:53:20,396 --> 00:53:23,797
-It's gonna be insane.
-To the max.

844
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,132
So, hey, Lis, you wanna
go see Judas Priest at Civic Arena?

845
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:32,369
-My friend Fitzy got me floor seats, so...
-That's okay. Take Boomer.

846
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,704
And go get the hose.
There's dried puke down there.

847
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,111
You don't like Priest?

848
00:53:38,147 --> 00:53:41,480
-I'm busy that night.
-I didn't tell you what night.

849
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:47,312
James, you and I should go out
some night.

850
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:50,622
I get it, that's a funny one.

851
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,594
Face! Douche.

852
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:55,659
-Just let me know when.
-Yeah?

853
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,028
Pete, dried puke.

854
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:11,879
I'm serious. I wouldn't mind going out
with a nice guy for a change.

855
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,509
Cool. Yeah. That would be very cool.

856
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,846
Oh, come on, man!

857
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,987
-Want to push a button?
-No, I'm on games only.

858
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,458
Okay, yeah, which one? Okay.

859
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,523
-Oh, my gosh!
-Shit! Shit! Shit!

860
00:54:28,731 --> 00:54:32,292
Wow! You fucked this up perfectly!

861
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:34,303
-I know. I work on games, so...
-I'm impressed.

862
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,771
I know.
I shouldn't have even been here.

863
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:38,467
-Shit.
-Hey.

864
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,198
Connell, I need to ask you something.

865
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:41,335
Hand me the crescent wrench,
would you?

866
00:54:41,377 --> 00:54:42,503
Yeah.

867
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:47,983
So, Lisa P. just asked me if I wanted
to go out with her sometime.

868
00:54:48,017 --> 00:54:50,485
-Lisa P.?
-Yeah. It's insane.

869
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,853
I think she might've just been trying
to piss off Pete O'Malley but...

870
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:57,291
Can you imagine any universe where
she would get with a guy like me?

871
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:58,760
She asked you out?

872
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,958
You're a fucking idiot if you don't go.
It's Lisa P.

873
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:04,057
-Hold this, would you?
-Yeah.

874
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,625
That girl's a virgin.
Can you believe that?

875
00:55:06,669 --> 00:55:09,502
Oh. In this day and age. You'd think...

876
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:13,407
Well, she's a Catholic girl.
They usually won't let you screw them.

877
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:17,573
-But what they will let you do...
-Yeah, but what about Em?

878
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:23,115
Are you getting all your needs
met by her?

879
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,653
We're taking it slow.

880
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:31,589
Right. Right. Okay, here's the thing.

881
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,265
Every time you meet a beautiful woman,

882
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:40,292
don't you imagine what she'd look like
underneath you, naked?

883
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:43,999
-What? No. No.
-Someone like Lisa P.

884
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,838
I mean, Jesus Christ, it's like
every cell in your body's on fire, right?

885
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,470
That's a little hyperbolic, but, yeah,
I know, I see where you're going.

886
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,208
That's the way we're wired.
It's the way we're wired.

887
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:55,843
It sucks, but it's just a fact of nature.
It's also tragic.

888
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:03,353
My feelings for Em are vast.

889
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:07,454
James, imagine it. Lisa P.

890
00:56:09,732 --> 00:56:14,669
I know. Lisa P. I know.

891
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:32,119
-Hey.
-Hey.

892
00:56:32,588 --> 00:56:33,987
I brought you this.

893
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:37,481
It's one of my favorite authors.
Gogol. Russian.

894
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:41,293
He lost his mind,
burned the only copy of his final book,

895
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,958
died a week later of self-starvation.

896
00:56:44,967 --> 00:56:45,991
Well...

897
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:50,270
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

898
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:59,473
Hey, do you maybe want to go see
a shitty movie or something sometime?

899
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:03,908
Yeah, I just... You know,
I did something kind of stupid.

900
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:08,322
I... I told my brother that
we made out.

901
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,950
-That's bad?
-No, no, no.

902
00:57:13,529 --> 00:57:15,759
But he... He told my parents.

903
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,693
We're Catholic.

904
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:24,463
Pete told my parents that you're Jewish.

905
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,376
But I'm an atheist.

906
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,346
I mean, more of a pragmatic nihilist,
I guess,

907
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,611
-or an existential pagan, if you will...
-Yeah, yeah.

908
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:37,813
But my parents are really strict.

909
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,087
I'm sorry.

910
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:46,317
-It's still a good book.
-Nah, I'm sorry.

911
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:53,561
-Hey, Joel.
-Hey.

912
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:57,169
How'd it go with Sue?

913
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,242
Not so good.

914
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:05,112
Hey, Em, come on. Don't say anything!

915
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,116
Come on, worse things have happened
to the Jews.

916
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,481
Fuck that!

917
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,148
You know,
you don't deserve to date Joel!

918
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:13,883
I mean, you're an anti-Semitic asshole!

919
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:15,891
What do you, like,
hate gay people, too?

920
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:19,884
Do you support apartheid?
You are not my friend.

921
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:25,997
Bam! Child's play.

922
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:31,565
Look, you can't tell anybody,
but I'm going out with Lisa P. tonight.

923
00:58:31,607 --> 00:58:32,699
-You're what?
-Yeah.

924
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:36,109
This morning she asked me
if I wanted to hang out sometime.

925
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:39,342
What happened?
I thought you were crazy about Em.

926
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:40,610
I am. I am.

927
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,845
But, you know,
I don't know if she necessarily,

928
00:58:42,885 --> 00:58:44,750
like, wants something, you know,
kind of serious.

929
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:49,383
And, Joel, we're men. You know,
we're, like, wired to meet our needs.

930
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,723
I get it, it's a biological imperative.

931
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:56,488
Frigo, you can't tell anybody,
but I have a date tonight with Lisa P.

932
00:58:56,532 --> 00:59:00,332
What? You know,
I should give you a double-sack-whack

933
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:03,827
-for telling a lie like that.
-Okay, don't believe me.

934
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:07,832
-Where are you going?
-The Velvet Touch.

935
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:13,810
Thanks.

936
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:21,113
How's the wine?

937
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,628
-It's good!
-Yeah.

938
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,831
I just need to tell you something.

939
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,839
Yeah, is it cool if we don't tell
a lot of people about tonight?

940
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:44,040
'Cause I think there's someone
at the park

941
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,413
who may have a little thing for me,
and I don't want her to feel bad.

942
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,942
-You mean Em?
-Yeah.

943
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,086
So you like working at the park?

944
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,593
Yeah, I think it could be
character building.

945
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,459
And, you know,
I've made a lot of friends.

946
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,555
Yeah, you and Connell
seem pretty tight.

947
01:00:02,598 --> 01:00:03,656
Yeah, I like him. I think he's interesting.

948
01:00:03,699 --> 01:00:05,633
I think he's kind of
like a, you know, poetic soul.

949
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:09,160
-That guy's got some problems.
-What do you mean?

950
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:14,576
Last summer, he was having this thing
with this girl from the snack bar.

951
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:18,369
He used to take her to his mother's
basement to have sex with her.

952
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:21,747
His mother's basement.
How gross is that?

953
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,481
But he's married, right?

954
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,921
-Didn't stop him from hitting on me.
-Wow.

955
01:00:33,095 --> 01:00:36,861
-Is that Frigo?
-Yeah, it is Frigo.

956
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:42,004
I wonder what he's doing here.
I should say hi. I've known him since...

957
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:43,562
Excuse me.

958
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:47,736
-You son of a bitch, that's Lisa P.!.
-What the fuck are you doing here?

959
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:51,235
I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry, I thought
you were full of shit, but holy shit!

960
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,441
There she is! Think you can get me
naked pictures of her?

961
01:00:53,482 --> 01:00:54,574
Frigo, get the fuck out of here,

962
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:56,016
and you can't tell anybody
about this, okay?

963
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:58,680
All right, all right, relax, Brennan.

964
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:01,152
-What's it worth to you?
-You're shaking me down?

965
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,215
No... Yeah, yeah.

966
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:06,685
I hate you with such great fervor. I...

967
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:10,263
Thanks, Brennan.

968
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,800
Sorry about that. What a coincidence.

969
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:20,275
Frigo was out to rent a video,
saw us through the window, and...

970
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:21,901
-Wow.
-Yeah.

971
01:01:22,511 --> 01:01:25,275
And here we are.
I wonder how the fondue is tonight.

972
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:31,644
I want to visit every continent,
every country, really.

973
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:36,686
Charles Dickens actually wrote
these really interesting travel pieces,

974
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:37,784
but he visited prisons...

975
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:40,352
Would you rather have a sailboat
or a speedboat?

976
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:44,859
-Gee, I guess...
-I think sailboats are, like,

977
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,461
way more cooler, you know,
like more classic.

978
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,966
Though I bet speedboats would be
a lot more fun.

979
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,637
What were you saying?

980
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:59,112
Just babbling.

981
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,206
Oh.

982
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:05,516
I just need to get normal
before I go inside.

983
01:02:05,554 --> 01:02:08,853
Put on some perfume
to cover the smell.

984
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,985
I was going to suggest more perfume.

985
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:13,620
-Shoot, my brush.
-Yeah. Hold on.

986
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:19,124
-Jesus, what the hell is this?
-Is that yours?

987
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:24,266
-No. I guess it's my dad's.
-Here, pull over here.

988
01:02:32,748 --> 01:02:34,545
Can you smell the pot?

989
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,286
You smell amazing.

990
01:02:44,126 --> 01:02:47,323
Thanks for tonight. It was fun.

991
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:50,332
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

992
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:05,710
Fondue.

993
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:16,120
-Oh, God.
-Tiger.

994
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:18,183
Sorry.

995
01:03:20,629 --> 01:03:22,392
-Another time.
-Yeah.

996
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,569
-Good night.
-Good night.

997
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:16,614
-Hey.
-Hey.

998
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,279
Hey. I missed your call last night.
Sorry about that.

999
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,289
I was out
with some old high-school buddies.

1000
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,853
-Sounds fun.
-Yeah, it was.

1001
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:26,418
We got caught up reminiscing.
I was out pretty late.

1002
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:28,657
But what were you calling about?

1003
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,927
Calling to say sorry. I felt like I was
kind of a jerk the other night.

1004
01:04:36,338 --> 01:04:41,105
Okay. Sorry. Yeah, me, too.
I was drunk.

1005
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,470
And I brought you something.

1006
01:04:45,714 --> 01:04:48,478
-This bag?
-Mmm-hmm. What's inside the bag?

1007
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:54,281
-Is that a couple of joints?
-I think so. For pot cookies.

1008
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,757
-Oh, my. You follow through.
-I do.

1009
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,121
Cool. This'll be fun.

1010
01:04:59,728 --> 01:05:03,186
-Let's do it.
-Okay. I'm only having half, okay?

1011
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:07,225
Walnuts? You want to see me go
into anaphylactic shock? Fuck.

1012
01:05:08,103 --> 01:05:11,595
-Home-made? Yummy.
-Brennan, you gonna eat the other half?

1013
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,169
Sorry.

1014
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,480
Spinning on that dizzy edge

1015
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,712
I kissed her face
and kissed her head

1016
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:26,278
And dreamed of
all the different ways

1017
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:29,018
I had to make her glow

1018
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:32,960
"Why are you so far away?" she said

1019
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:37,932
"Why won't you ever know
that I'm in love with you

1020
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,664
"That I'm in love with you"

1021
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:44,901
You
Soft and only

1022
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,034
You
Lost and lonely

1023
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:51,342
You
Strange as angels

1024
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:54,349
Dancing in the deepest oceans

1025
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:57,181
Twisting in the water

1026
01:05:57,219 --> 01:06:00,552
And what a race we have here today,
ladies and gentlemen. Boy!

1027
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,989
And nobody is in the lead.
Nobody is in the lead.

1028
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:05,619
In fact, what is so mind-blowing
about this particular race

1029
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:09,153
is how evenly-matched
these particular competitors are.

1030
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:12,926
And Yellow is dead last.
I don't think Yellow's moved once.

1031
01:06:13,335 --> 01:06:16,930
This is a fall from grace
for the once-great stallion, Yellow.

1032
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:20,831
You know, Yellow has inseminated
over 1, 000 foals in his lifetime,

1033
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,071
which might explain
his current exhaustion.

1034
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:29,314
And you won, Number 9,
here you go... Here you go, great job.

1035
01:06:30,185 --> 01:06:31,516
Hey, Bobby.

1036
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,012
Brennan, what are you doing?

1037
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:37,825
-You been toking up?
-What?

1038
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,351
-You been drinking drugs?
-No!

1039
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:43,024
Your eyes are red.
Have you been crying?

1040
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:46,762
Yeah, maybe, like, a little bit before.
But no, Bobby,

1041
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:50,067
I'm feeling sick because I think I ate
a bad corn dog before, Bobby.

1042
01:06:50,105 --> 01:06:51,129
That's why.

1043
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,664
You know, why don't you go over
to Hats Off T o Larry

1044
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:56,303
-and collect some balls?
-Okay.

1045
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,973
And I'll tell you what, I'll take over this.

1046
01:07:02,017 --> 01:07:03,644
Hey, you all right?

1047
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,586
-Yeah, thank you.
-All right.

1048
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:07,148
This is how we met.

1049
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:12,284
And they're off! In the lead is Green 5.
Green is in the lead.

1050
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:16,890
Green 5, Green 5 in the lead.
And there you are, Green 5!

1051
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:20,732
Green! You really got it going on!
You know exactly what you're doing.

1052
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:23,966
Green! You got it, Green! You won!

1053
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,234
Pass that down to her.
Loser, pass that down. Thank you.

1054
01:07:36,518 --> 01:07:40,079
-Can I get some balls?
-You're gonna have to get more balls.

1055
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:42,283
The customer's always right.

1056
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,120
Here you go.

1057
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:52,532
-I hit that thing dead-on!
-Yet he still retains his chapeau.

1058
01:07:53,535 --> 01:07:55,435
Whoa, whoa. Come on.

1059
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:56,495
Hey!

1060
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:03,311
What the fuck?
It's glued on, the fucking thing.

1061
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,506
-It's not worth it.
-We have a winner.

1062
01:08:05,547 --> 01:08:07,242
-Nicky.
-Congratulations.

1063
01:08:07,282 --> 01:08:10,649
The fucking thing is glued on?
His hat is glued on?

1064
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:12,984
-Fuck this, Nicky.
-What is so fucking funny?

1065
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:15,387
-Yeah, what's so fucking funny?
-I don't know.

1066
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:18,182
-Oh, my God!
-My God.

1067
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:20,661
-What the fuck?
-Not so funny now, is it?

1068
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:23,096
You can't do shit like that.
Like, what the fuck?

1069
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,963
-You punch him in the face?
-Back off, slut!

1070
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,562
-Don't fucking touch her, man.
-What are you gonna do, faggot?

1071
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,838
Oh, fuck.

1072
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:38,779
-You're fucking dead!
-You jerk!

1073
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:44,648
<i>Breaking the law, breaking the law</i>

1074
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:50,816
<i>Breaking the law, breaking the law</i>

1075
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,796
-The option of the flute?
-Option of the flute...

1076
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,032
People are trying to kill me.

1077
01:09:09,878 --> 01:09:12,210
Get the fuck out, motherfucker!

1078
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:14,175
Move.

1079
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,848
Get out of my doorway, motherfucker!
Give me a reason!

1080
01:09:18,887 --> 01:09:22,254
Just give me a fucking reason!
You don't know what I'm capable of!

1081
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:26,955
Come on! Please!
You don't know what I'm capable of!

1082
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,270
-Bastard.
-Thanks, Bobby.

1083
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:37,795
-No problem.
-Okay, I'm gonna take the back way.

1084
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,898
Yeah, yeah, good.

1085
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:42,035
You know what, now that I think of it,
the flute is actually more expensive.

1086
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:44,568
You guys should have seen
Brennan wail on that greaseball, man.

1087
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:46,274
-I can't believe you hit someone.
-Me, either.

1088
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:48,340
How'd you do it?
Did you hit him like this? Oh, psych!

1089
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:52,280
Dude, this guy was huge.
I mean, Brennan went up, like, one hit...

1090
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,881
-And just dropped the guy.
-I can't believe they call that a hit.

1091
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:57,221
Then his buddy started
chasing him all around the park,

1092
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:58,726
and then he hid in Bobby's office.

1093
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,887
Yeah, see, that's more like 
the son of a bitch.

1094
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:02,294
Bobby kicked the door down

1095
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,231
and came out all psycho
with this bat like...

1096
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:06,234
And all his buddies just go, "Okay."

1097
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:07,667
Where's the guy?
Was he ever...

1098
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,034
I don't know.
They left him on the pavement.

1099
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:11,301
Then I got his girlfriend's number.

1100
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:14,976
Where are you taking me?

1101
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,278
You've never been to this place before?

1102
01:10:18,313 --> 01:10:19,644
No.

1103
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:31,587
I think you might be the coolest
and cutest guy I ever met.

1104
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:33,389
Really?

1105
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,221
I mean, I'm really high, but...

1106
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,326
I don't want to lose you.

1107
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:33,514
-Forget to refrigerate these?
-Yeah.

1108
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,814
When did they get in, yesterday?

1109
01:11:36,858 --> 01:11:39,383
-Around what time?
-In the morning.

1110
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:45,032
-They smell weird?
-Yeah.

1111
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,865
-I think that's normal, though.
-Yeah.

1112
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:50,633
Stuffy, fry these up!

1113
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:54,965
Hey, Brennan, I want to talk to you.
Want to pick up some extra shifts?

1114
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,774
-Yeah, sure.
-Good. Because Joel quit.

1115
01:11:58,213 --> 01:11:59,737
-What?
-He's passed on.

1116
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:03,774
He moved on, honey.
He didn't pass on, he moved on.

1117
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,580
I know, I heard you!

1118
01:12:14,796 --> 01:12:18,630
-What are you doing here?
-You didn't call me back.

1119
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:22,266
Look, I can't abide the humiliation
of you seeing the inside of my house.

1120
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:25,432
The vile plastic slipcovers,
the art-fair paintings.

1121
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:29,638
And it's really messy.
Just go around back. I'll meet you.

1122
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,145
Okay.

1123
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:36,148
Hey, Jeffrey!
Turn off the fucking lawnmower.

1124
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:40,846
-Fine.
-I'm trying to have a conversation here.

1125
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:46,154
-Fuck off, fuck face.
-Nimrod.

1126
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:47,286
I hate you, asshole.

1127
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:51,629
-Hey, is it because of Sue?
-What?

1128
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:54,727
Why you quit. Because, Joel,
you're a great guy, you know,

1129
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:56,397
and she doesn't deserve you.

1130
01:12:56,438 --> 01:13:00,204
James, look at me.
I'm not a good-looking guy.

1131
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,870
And I'm poor.
Girls aren't gonna go near me

1132
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:05,471
when there's all these
fucking yuppies around.

1133
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,209
That's ridiculous.
Not all women are like that.

1134
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:09,513
You know, Em isn't like that.

1135
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:10,984
-Em?
-Yeah.

1136
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:15,449
You don't even appreciate
what you have.

1137
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:17,390
You're chasing after Lisa P.

1138
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:22,261
when you have this incredible,
beautiful girl right fucking there.

1139
01:13:25,133 --> 01:13:26,498
Fuck this.

1140
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,345
Don't do that.

1141
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:53,525
-I thought you were off today.
-I need to tell you something.

1142
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:03,702
Last week I went on a date with Lisa P.
She asked me out.

1143
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:06,799
It was nothing. We kissed a little bit
at the end of the date,

1144
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:11,802
and I felt her breast a little bit,
but nothing else.

1145
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:14,508
Right. No intercourse?

1146
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:17,213
No. No intercourse.

1147
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:22,119
Look, I'm sorry, it's just... You and I
never talked about being exclusive.

1148
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:26,651
I don't want to see her again, okay?
You're the one I...

1149
01:14:29,197 --> 01:14:31,722
Look, we'll both be in New York soon,
and I want to hang out with you.

1150
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:34,668
I want to get to know you better,

1151
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,968
if you want to get to know me better
as well.

1152
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:39,803
James, you don't owe me anything.

1153
01:14:39,841 --> 01:14:43,470
I know, but I want to owe you things.

1154
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:48,909
I'm ready to owe you things, okay?
Because I really, really care about you.

1155
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:54,384
-Are you mad at me? 'Cause I'm sorry.
-No, no. I'm not mad at you.

1156
01:14:55,524 --> 01:15:01,053
Thanks for telling me.
That was, like, really sweet.

1157
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,526
-Are you crazy? You can't come here.
-I just can't do this anymore.

1158
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:44,198
I'm starting to really
fucking hate myself, you know?

1159
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:48,005
Oh, Christ.
My wife probably heard me come in.

1160
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,534
Just... I gotta...
We'll find someplace to talk.

1161
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,639
I gotta go make an excuse.
Park outside my mom's house, okay?

1162
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:55,343
-Okay.
-All right.

1163
01:15:57,919 --> 01:16:01,116
Brennan. Yo, Brennan.
Come here!

1164
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:06,157
Brennan, you gotta hear this.
Tell him. Tell him what you told me.

1165
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:08,458
I ate too many circus peanuts.

1166
01:16:08,496 --> 01:16:11,431
No, what? No, not that, retard.
The other thing, the thing about Em.

1167
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:14,128
Frigo, shut up.
Wait, what thing about Em?

1168
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:17,161
I saw Em and Connell in his car.

1169
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,673
Right, right.
What were they doing in the car, Rich?

1170
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:23,667
They were doing push-ups in his car.
They didn't have any pants on.

1171
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:26,272
No pants.
Naked push-ups, retard, for fucking.

1172
01:16:26,314 --> 01:16:27,975
-James, they were fucking.
-Frigo, Frigo. Shut up.

1173
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:32,419
-When did you see this, Rich?
-Like, a while ago, a while ago.

1174
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:34,445
It was just a couple
of weeks ago, right, Rich?

1175
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:46,057
-Hello?
-Mr. Lewin, it's James. Is Emily there?

1176
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:49,969
She said she was with you.
She said she was gonna go meet you.

1177
01:16:50,538 --> 01:16:54,474
Oh, yeah.
I think we got our wires crossed.

1178
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:57,007
Okay, bye.

1179
01:17:01,816 --> 01:17:03,147
What'd he say?

1180
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:06,977
Can you get your mother's car?

1181
01:17:08,723 --> 01:17:11,487
All right, I got the keys. Push me out.

1182
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:31,879
I don't want to drink.

1183
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:40,382
Did you know James went out
with Lisa P. last week?

1184
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:42,583
-I know.
-You know.

1185
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,785
-You want me to rat out James?
-Right.

1186
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:51,355
-Slow down.
-Shit.

1187
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:52,423
It's Em's car.

1188
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,162
Let's wait here.

1189
01:18:00,675 --> 01:18:03,405
I stole some of my grandma's
cough medicine if you want some.

1190
01:18:04,045 --> 01:18:05,637
-No.
-It's grape.

1191
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,375
-No, please.
-Okay.

1192
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:10,516
Can you sit down, please,
just for a second?

1193
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:18,158
-Look, you want to end this?
-Yes.

1194
01:18:21,696 --> 01:18:24,028
I got a hockey stick in the back,
if you want to smash the windows.

1195
01:18:24,065 --> 01:18:26,829
-Frigo, shut the fuck up, okay?
-All right, okay, Brennan.

1196
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:29,132
-Just trying to help.
-Oh, shit.

1197
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:43,550
What are you doing here?

1198
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:46,279
Are you and Connell, like...

1199
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:52,518
It started in, like...
I didn't even know you when it...

1200
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:59,697
How did you... What are you...
How did you find me here?

1201
01:19:00,301 --> 01:19:04,738
Lisa P. told me that Connell used to
take some other girl here last summer

1202
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,731
to his mother's basement.

1203
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:09,404
Right.

1204
01:19:11,312 --> 01:19:15,476
Yeah, I just, like, don't understand
how you could do this.

1205
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:17,542
I came here to...

1206
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:21,652
I know. I know I fucked up, too, okay?

1207
01:19:21,689 --> 01:19:25,682
I fucked up one time, and I fucking
told you about it, and you...

1208
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:28,589
You think I'm, like, some fucking
pathetic idiot or something.

1209
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:31,531
You're not a fucking idiot.
I'm a fucking idiot.

1210
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:34,826
Yeah, that's right.

1211
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:47,238
Shit.

1212
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:05,656
I am the champion.
To the victor go the spoils.

1213
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:09,694
-Here you go.
-What? What is this?

1214
01:20:09,737 --> 01:20:13,969
-Is it a banana?
-It's a banana with eyes.

1215
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:17,904
I'd watch my mouth if I were you,
carnival boy.

1216
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:40,892
Hey.

1217
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,198
What's up?

1218
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:49,440
I mean...

1219
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:53,845
I actually feel sorry for them, you know.

1220
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:57,083
Like, sneaking around
and lying to everybody.

1221
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:01,552
It's, like, so pathetic.
He's a married man.

1222
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:03,614
I know. I know.

1223
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:10,295
Hey, Lisa, you can't, like,
tell anybody about this. Ever.

1224
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:15,801
Of course, I would never.

1225
01:21:32,987 --> 01:21:34,147
Thanks.

1226
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:36,618
Hey, Em, what's up?

1227
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:39,584
Loving life, you know.

1228
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:41,993
Hey, you know I play the drums?

1229
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:45,193
I did this killer drum solo
at the high-school talent show once.

1230
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:49,067
I played Limelight by Rush.
1, 2, 3, 4!

1231
01:21:53,474 --> 01:21:55,567
<i>Living on a lighted stage</i>

1232
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,601
<i>Approaches the unreal</i>

1233
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:02,412
<i>For those who think and feel
In touch with some reality</i>

1234
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,350
<i>Beyond the...</i>

1235
01:22:08,656 --> 01:22:11,090
Spin. Good night, Adventureland!

1236
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:15,894
-What the fuck was that?
-You like musicians, right?

1237
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,676
Hey, honey,
I'm running out of googly eyes.

1238
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:30,769
Do you have any more over there?

1239
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:34,646
Yeah, me, too, but I found these,
so I've just been sort of...

1240
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:39,185
-Hey.
-Hey, Em! What's up?

1241
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,851
I quit. See you.

1242
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:52,499
Tommy, you think there's something
wrong with this car?

1243
01:22:52,533 --> 01:22:53,591
Have your father check it

1244
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,466
because it's making
a funny squeaking sound.

1245
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:57,869
I don't know what the problem is.

1246
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:00,631
Shit-head!

1247
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:10,284
Shake a leg and come aboard
the SS Adventureland.

1248
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:12,650
I'm not friends with anybody.
How the hell would I know?

1249
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:15,850
-I don't know.
-No way!

1250
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:16,948
Em? Em Lewin?

1251
01:23:16,991 --> 01:23:18,754
Yes, yes, yes.
Can you believe that?

1252
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:21,523
Em has been sleeping
with Connell all summer.

1253
01:23:21,562 --> 01:23:24,929
-I'm telling you, man.
-Connell is a freaking god.

1254
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:36,475
-Hey, Lisa.
-Hey.

1255
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:40,139
Hi. Look, I don't know what to say,

1256
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:43,241
but everyone is talking about
Em and Connell.

1257
01:23:44,952 --> 01:23:47,113
Kelly's got such a big F-ing mouth.

1258
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:51,592
I'm sorry because I gave you my word.
We were just so wasted that night.

1259
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:55,424
You know I can't hide nothing
from Kell.

1260
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:58,258
Are you mad at me?

1261
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:02,668
Well, yeah.
Connell's gonna freak out, and Em quit.

1262
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:07,198
I feel bad for Connell.
I have a hard time feeling sorry for Em.

1263
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:10,804
Guys can't help themselves.

1264
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:13,678
-But he's the married one.
-Yeah, Em's a frigging home wrecker.

1265
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:16,411
-He's cheating on his wife, though.
-I can't believe you're defending her.

1266
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:19,511
What? Because guys can be shitty
and women can't?

1267
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:22,590
The Musik-Express!

1268
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:23,670
The Musik-Express!

1269
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,749
Kell.

1270
01:24:37,805 --> 01:24:40,273
It's fun because it's really more
like dancing than exercising, you know.

1271
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:42,970
I have a blast. I've been trying to
get him to go with me, but he won't go.

1272
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:44,602
No, you're not doing it right.

1273
01:24:44,645 --> 01:24:46,374
Yeah, I don't like lifting my knees
that high.

1274
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:47,813
Yeah, I've noticed.

1275
01:24:50,017 --> 01:24:54,215
Emily, you know the Ostrows
and the Waldsteins.

1276
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:56,987
Hi there.

1277
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:03,458
Can I get anyone a refresher?

1278
01:25:05,299 --> 01:25:09,531
Francy, these pieces, I love them.
So great.

1279
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:12,539
Those there? I love those.
I think they are so fun.

1280
01:25:12,573 --> 01:25:16,509
You're so artsy.
I love what you've done with the house.

1281
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:20,438
-Thank you.
-It's... It's clean.

1282
01:25:20,481 --> 01:25:23,609
I thought the house was a lot nicer
the way my mom used to have it.

1283
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:26,620
It's pretty barfarific, if you ask me.

1284
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:34,858
-Is that some kind of joke, Emily?
-No, it's not.

1285
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:39,529
I think you owe me an apology.
Right now.

1286
01:25:40,334 --> 01:25:41,995
I don't owe you shit.

1287
01:25:42,703 --> 01:25:44,728
All right, okay. You know what?
Give me the drink.

1288
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:46,797
Look, you weren't invited,
and I don't want you here, okay?

1289
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:49,366
-Right, I wasn't invited to this party.
-Yes, you weren't invited,

1290
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:50,900
and frankly,
I don't like you coming in here

1291
01:25:50,945 --> 01:25:52,503
and saying
whatever the hell you want, okay?

1292
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:55,539
I am sick and tired of your behavior,
you ungrateful little bitch.

1293
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:57,778
-Give me the drink.
-Okay, Em...

1294
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,684
God damn it!

1295
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:06,052
Emily! Emily, this has to stop.
You cannot say those things no more.

1296
01:26:06,093 --> 01:26:07,390
I can't say what I'm thinking

1297
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:10,124
and what I'm feeling every fucking day?

1298
01:26:11,532 --> 01:26:14,831
-Sy, for God's sake!
-I can't force her out.

1299
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:17,667
Yeah? Well maybe you can't...

1300
01:26:34,121 --> 01:26:36,715
<i>Sometimes I feel so happy</i>

1301
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:43,254
Hey, can I have another? Thanks.

1302
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:49,634
<i>Sometimes I feel so happy</i>

1303
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:53,834
<i>But mostly you just make me mad</i>

1304
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:59,572
<i>Baby, you just make me mad</i>

1305
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:07,580
<i>Linger on</i>

1306
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:11,925
<i>Your pale blue eyes</i>

1307
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:18,563
<i>Linger on</i>

1308
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:23,428
<i>Your pale blue eyes</i>

1309
01:27:25,806 --> 01:27:27,068
Oh, fuck!

1310
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:44,148
James, get out of the car.

1311
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,020
Now!

1312
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:59,797
Oh, God. Come with me.

1313
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:08,043
You care to explain how
Mrs. Frigo's rhododendron got here?

1314
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:15,688
Good morning.

1315
01:28:18,392 --> 01:28:20,087
What's this, mister?

1316
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:26,558
What the hell is wrong with you?

1317
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:30,002
You know, I think that Adventureland
has made you regress or something.

1318
01:28:30,037 --> 01:28:32,335
You're quitting that job.

1319
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:36,776
-I never want to go back there again.
-Good. How much have you saved?

1320
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:41,911
$1,322, give or take.

1321
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:45,544
Well, the front axle is broken,
but that might cover the damage.

1322
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:48,248
And you're gonna have to pay
for Mrs. Frigo's rhododendron, too.

1323
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:50,348
I need every cent of that for New York.

1324
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:52,723
Well, I'm sorry, you know,
you should have thought about that

1325
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,923
before you went out
on this little joyride of yours.

1326
01:29:02,436 --> 01:29:04,768
Brennan, I'm back.

1327
01:29:04,805 --> 01:29:06,397
Thank God. How the hell are you?

1328
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:10,809
Well, Europe changed me.
It was revelatory.

1329
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:15,078
There I was, going from
one incredible city to the next.

1330
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:18,574
The ruins, the cathedrals,
the endless art treasures.

1331
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:19,847
And I realized something.

1332
01:29:20,354 --> 01:29:23,084
Fuck the Old World.
I want the New World.

1333
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:24,455
-What?
-And I want it now!

1334
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:27,950
-What do you mean?
-I'm going to Harvard Business.

1335
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:30,491
You're what? You're applying?

1336
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:35,264
No, I'm in, actually. You know,
strings were pulled, wheels greased.

1337
01:29:36,103 --> 01:29:38,264
Wait, that's in Boston.

1338
01:29:38,839 --> 01:29:41,831
What about New York
and the apartment?

1339
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:46,370
Yeah. Sorry about that, man.
I can't really help you out there.

1340
01:29:51,218 --> 01:29:56,417
Hey, litterbug. Hey! In the clown mouth.
These guys.

1341
01:29:56,457 --> 01:29:58,755
-Hey, Bobby, Paulette.
-Hey, Brennan.

1342
01:29:58,793 --> 01:30:00,055
Hey, how are you?

1343
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:04,155
You know, we're just...
It's the last weekend of the season.

1344
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:08,032
Just getting ready for winter,
closing up shop.

1345
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:09,696
We have to turn all these lights off.

1346
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:11,432
-Your check's in the office.
-Okay.

1347
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:13,940
We gonna see you next summer?

1348
01:30:13,974 --> 01:30:15,669
Thank you, Bobby, for everything.
Really.

1349
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:18,474
-Gonna see you next summer.
-Well, thank you, really.

1350
01:30:18,979 --> 01:30:20,378
We're halfway through our set,

1351
01:30:20,414 --> 01:30:22,279
and we see him. It's fucking Lou Reed.

1352
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:23,374
-Oh, my...
-Holy shit!

1353
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:24,509
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I keep thinking

1354
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:25,746
I'm about to wake up any second.

1355
01:30:25,786 --> 01:30:28,016
And he gets up, gets on stage,
puts on a guitar,

1356
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:30,182
and we do a whole fucking set
of his songs.

1357
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:33,193
-We do Vicious, Shed A Light On Love.
-Oh, my God.

1358
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:35,752
-What a pisser.
-We do I'm Waiting For The Man.

1359
01:30:35,796 --> 01:30:38,856
Wait, hold on, one second.

1360
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,333
-Hey, last paycheck?
-Yep.

1361
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:46,138
So, how's it going?

1362
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:49,638
-Ronnie found out everything.
-Sorry.

1363
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:53,741
Yeah, it was bad.
It's blown over now, mostly.

1364
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,608
Hey, do you speak to Em?

1365
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:02,320
Not since she quit. You?

1366
01:31:07,294 --> 01:31:11,822
You know the song is called
Satellite of Love, the Lou Reed song.

1367
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:14,232
You said Shed A Light On Love,
but it's Satellite.

1368
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:16,600
-Yeah, I know. It's Satellite Of Love.
-Yeah, it's like Skylab.

1369
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:19,367
Yeah, I know, it's...
Yeah, it's called Satellite Of Love.

1370
01:31:19,406 --> 01:31:20,703
Yeah.

1371
01:31:26,947 --> 01:31:29,279
Take care of yourself, Brennan.

1372
01:31:29,316 --> 01:31:30,908
Yeah, you, too.

1373
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:38,881
-Where were we?
-You were telling us about the...

1374
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:40,018
-Satellite Of Love.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1375
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:41,084
That's what we were talking about.

1376
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:42,186
That's my favorite one!

1377
01:31:42,229 --> 01:31:43,321
Yeah, it's a good tune.

1378
01:31:43,697 --> 01:31:47,463
Yes! We got the Viet Cong, fellas. 
We got the Viet Cong here!

1379
01:31:47,501 --> 01:31:50,061
I need suppressive fire,
but I can handle it.

1380
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:52,038
I think I got this under control.

1381
01:31:52,072 --> 01:31:55,508
-Your friend Eric boned you, huh?
-Yeah.

1382
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:57,511
How are you gonna
pull off New York now?

1383
01:31:57,545 --> 01:32:00,105
I can't pull it off. I'm stuck here.

1384
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:04,482
What's the point of being a writer
or an artist anyway?

1385
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:07,587
Herman Melville wrote
fucking Moby Dick,

1386
01:32:07,621 --> 01:32:10,089
and he was so poor and forgotten
by the time he died

1387
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:13,924
that in his obituary,
they called him Henry Melville.

1388
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:15,019
You know? Like, why bother?

1389
01:32:15,062 --> 01:32:17,155
They're just gonna forget
our fucking names anyway.

1390
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:19,894
Viet Cong, Viet Cong! I'm coming!

1391
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:21,401
I got it!

1392
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:25,669
I heard Em went back to New York.

1393
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:29,073
I wish it didn't end like that.
I should've...

1394
01:32:29,109 --> 01:32:30,701
I don't know.

1395
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,443
Get behind me. Boom!

1396
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:38,030
I got 2! There's 1! There's 2!
What's that?

1397
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:41,544
Boom! Boom! Boom, baby, boom!

1398
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:57,363
Your Herman Melville story,
that's bullshit.

1399
01:32:57,404 --> 01:32:59,838
It's true. They called him Henry.

1400
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:03,640
No, I mean he wrote
a 700-page allegorical novel

1401
01:33:03,677 --> 01:33:06,373
about the whaling industry.
I think he was...

1402
01:33:06,413 --> 01:33:09,644
I think he was
a pretty passionate guy, Joel.

1403
01:33:09,683 --> 01:33:12,015
I hope they call me Henry
when I die, too.

1404
01:33:12,052 --> 01:33:14,077
Yeah? One can only hope.

1405
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:23,226
Brennan, don't get all drunk
and fall asleep.

1406
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:26,631
-Why?
-Because I'll jack off on your face.

1407
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:30,933
-Okay, I'm gonna go.
-What?

1408
01:33:30,971 --> 01:33:33,132
I'll see you around, Frigo.

1409
01:33:34,508 --> 01:33:35,941
All right.

1410
01:33:37,578 --> 01:33:40,274
Good luck with him. Even.

1411
01:33:42,182 --> 01:33:43,479
Good one!

1412
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:48,115
That was nice, Brennan. That was nice.

1413
01:33:50,724 --> 01:33:51,748
That must have hurt.

1414
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:27,954
Look me in the eye

1415
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:32,625
Then tell me that I'm satisfied

1416
01:34:35,703 --> 01:34:40,640
Hey, are you satisfied?

1417
01:34:42,409 --> 01:34:48,541
And it goes so slowly on

1418
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:53,713
Everything I've ever wanted

1419
01:34:54,621 --> 01:34:56,748
Tell me what's wrong

1420
01:34:57,791 --> 01:35:00,157
Look me in the eye

1421
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:04,358
And tell me that I'm satisfied

1422
01:35:07,768 --> 01:35:11,169
Were you satisfied?

1423
01:35:26,987 --> 01:35:30,821
Hi. I just got off the bus.
I'm a New Yorker now.

1424
01:35:31,291 --> 01:35:33,885
I guess I should
probably buy an umbrella.

1425
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:38,193
I don't think I can see you.

1426
01:35:38,866 --> 01:35:39,992
What?

1427
01:35:41,668 --> 01:35:45,160
This summer was rough.

1428
01:35:47,775 --> 01:35:52,007
I did things that I really, really regret.

1429
01:35:53,047 --> 01:35:55,015
Yeah, me, too.

1430
01:35:56,016 --> 01:35:59,281
I'm sorry I told Lisa P.
about you and Connell.

1431
01:36:01,188 --> 01:36:04,419
She, you know,
told the rest of the world, but...

1432
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,285
I'm not gonna lie.
I was really angry at you,

1433
01:36:08,328 --> 01:36:10,922
but you didn't deserve that.

1434
01:36:11,832 --> 01:36:13,800
You know, James,

1435
01:36:14,902 --> 01:36:19,100
I am so sorry for fucking this up.

1436
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:23,970
You know, you were the only good
thing that happened this summer.

1437
01:36:27,347 --> 01:36:28,712
Wait, Em.

1438
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:36,681
I think I maybe see you
a little differently than you see yourself.

1439
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:39,959
Yes, I see the person who fucked up,
but I also see the person

1440
01:36:39,993 --> 01:36:43,292
who saved me from being knifed
over a giant-ass panda,

1441
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:47,460
who introduced me
to psychotropic-chocolate-chip cookies,

1442
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:52,029
and who stood up for Joel, and
who doesn't make apologies for herself.

1443
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:59,242
Look, my theory is you can't just avoid
everybody you screw up with.

1444
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:02,646
And you should trust me.
I'm a New Yorker.

1445
01:37:09,289 --> 01:37:10,916
-You are soaking wet.
-Yeah.

1446
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:12,186
Do you have anything else
you can wear?

1447
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:14,126
I'll check.

1448
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:16,629
-Do you want some tea?
-Yeah.

1449
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:22,769
No, everything in here is soaking wet.

1450
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:26,697
-Here.
-Thanks.

1451
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:32,112
So you're going to Columbia?

1452
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:34,910
No. No. Maybe next year. No.

1453
01:37:35,682 --> 01:37:36,706
Why?

1454
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:41,483
I wrecked my dad's car,
and I lost all my carny money.

1455
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:43,914
So what's the plan?

1456
01:37:43,957 --> 01:37:48,485
I'm gonna crash at the Y for a week.
I'm gonna look for a shitty job and...

1457
01:37:49,696 --> 01:37:51,186
I don't know.

1458
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,825
Here. Give me your shirt.

1459
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:03,602
-I'll get you another shirt.
-Thanks.

1460
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:07,041
Hey, Em.

1461
01:38:11,318 --> 01:38:13,309
I really missed you.

1462
01:38:21,195 --> 01:38:23,095
You wanna wear this?

1463
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:28,091
I... No. No.
I never wanna see that again.

1464
01:38:29,536 --> 01:38:33,131
Why do you have that?
Why do you have that stupid shirt?

1465
01:38:39,513 --> 01:38:41,640
Is it okay that I did that?

1466
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:43,880
Yeah.

1467
01:39:21,822 --> 01:39:23,221
-Are we doing this?
-I think so.

1468
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:25,657
Okay, we are? Okay.

1469
01:39:29,296 --> 01:39:30,456
Okay.
