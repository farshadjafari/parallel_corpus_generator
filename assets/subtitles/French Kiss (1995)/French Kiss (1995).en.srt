1
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,749
When'd you buy these? They're beautiful.

2
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:09,539
Bed sheets.

3
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:14,377
- So where are the drapes? On your bed?
- Gotta try to find the second life in things.

4
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,420
- How's your school?
- Good. Hard.

5
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:21,470
- I would love to go back.
- So go!

6
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:24,478
I think it's a little late in the game, no?

7
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:29,525
School would be a piece of cake
compared to what you've been through.

8
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:32,612
Thank God for this one, huh?

9
00:03:32,697 --> 00:03:36,232
She saved our lives, this little girl.
She really did.

10
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,618
- How you doin', Rosie?
- Hi, Jimmy.

11
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:41,241
Hey, little girl.

12
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:43,573
Hey, little girl. Big girl.

13
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:48,666
- What's up?
- Rosie's gonna sit for Corinna, study here.

14
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:52,590
- Tonight?
- Yeah, we got the meeting.

15
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:57,172
I caught the one by work. The nooner.

16
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,423
We were supposed to go tonight.

17
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:03,597
Yeah, but I gotta go to Albany tomorrow.
I gotta check out that body shop.

18
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:07,103
I think it's better when we go together,
don't you?

19
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:08,973
Huh...

20
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:11,191
Jimmy fucked up?

21
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:14,897
How much I owe?

22
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:17,482
Gimme a dollar.

23
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:19,653
OK.

24
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:23,491
You go to the meeting. I'll watch the baby.

25
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,868
- Sorry, Rosie. OK?
- No big thing.

26
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:29,915
We'll pay you half for comin' downstairs.

27
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,309
Come on.

28
00:04:45,397 --> 00:04:47,935
- Come on.
- Jimmy!

29
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:51,060
- Jimmy!
- Here you go.

30
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:55,398
Jimmy!

31
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:57,909
Shh!

32
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:01,700
- Jimmy, I'm a fuckin' dead man!
- What are you doin' here, Ronnie?

33
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:07,543
I got eight cars on a carrier. Boat's leavin'
in 90 minutes and no driver. I need your help.

34
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,209
You are not listening to me, OK?
I can go back to jail just for talkin' to you.

35
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:15,839
I know. I know. I know, Jimmy.

36
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:18,419
I know. I went to three guys before you.

37
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:22,726
I know you don't want to be involved
with this shit - and I respect that, Jimmy -

38
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,642
but I don't know what else to do.
You know who I have to answer to?

39
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:28,937
Little Junior Brown.

40
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:32,774
Ronnie, this is your problem.
I don't give a shit.

41
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:36,397
Look what he did to my hand last week.
He thought I shorted him $50.

42
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:41,533
Now I got $350,000 worth of this guy's cars
and no driver! I need your help here.

43
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,947
Ronnie, I have a baby inside.

44
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,199
Everybody respects this but you.

45
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:48,535
Jimmy, you havin' a party?

46
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:51,499
Jimmy, I know that.
But you gotta help me out.

47
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,876
You cannot come to me
with this shit any more.

48
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:56,427
- You gotta help me.
- Out.

49
00:05:56,512 --> 00:05:59,429
You know I love you, man. I respect you, man.

50
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:02,302
I'll give you $1500. We'll be back in two hours.

51
00:06:02,393 --> 00:06:06,260
Ronnie, I don't want your fuckin' money.
Get outta here.

52
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,400
You don't want my fuckin' money? Huh?

53
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:15,156
I remember after your mom died.
You remember?

54
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:19,985
And your father used to go on his benders.
Whose people came to get you, man?

55
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:22,782
Whose people came to get you?
Where'd you live?

56
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:25,446
When you had no place to live,
where'd you live?

57
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:29,919
- That was a long time ago.
- My family's never asked you for nothin'.

58
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:35,215
Jimmy, I never asked you for nothin', man.

59
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:47,511
Jimmy, this guy's gonna cripple me, man.
He's gonna cripple me.

60
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:50,891
I'm your blood cousin, Jimmy.
I'm your blood cousin.

61
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:53,060
It'll take two hours, man.

62
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:58,942
Please don't let this happen. Please don't let
this fuckin' guy hurt me. He's gonna kill me!

63
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:03,613
The babysitter from upstairs, get her down.
It'll take two hours. Pay her double.

64
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,782
Please, Jimmy. Please...

65
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:10,328
Please.

66
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,553
- Hey. I wake your parents up?
- Don't worry about it.

67
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,131
- OK. I should be back in two hours.
- OK.

68
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:25,302
- Thanks.
- Sure.

69
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:58,087
Since you went away, man, we got big, man.
No more smash-and-grab bullshit.

70
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:03,173
You know I got a half-size difference in my
shoes and gotta put three insoles in the left?

71
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:06,470
Now when I see some shoes I want,
I buy two pairs - 10½ and 11.

72
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:10,726
- I'm talkin' $300, $400 kicks.
- I don't give a fuck about your shoes.

73
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:12,359
Mr. Jimmy!

74
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:16,227
I'm talkin' $200, $300 kicks.
When you want back in, you let me...

75
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:23,534
You playin' time games with me?

76
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:28,034
Whoa. Junior, I'm your man.
It's gonna happen.

77
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:31,578
Remove the fucking hand.

78
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:40,091
I'm your guy, Junior. I'm here.
There's no problem. Let's just do it.

79
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,422
You're here, huh?

80
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:47,219
He's here!

81
00:08:48,272 --> 00:08:50,348
We're saved

82
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:55,313
Come on, Junior, man. It's not my fault.

83
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:58,272
What the fuck, man?

84
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:01,359
He's a drunk, man!

85
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:05,869
Look who showed up to drive.
He's fuckin' socked.

86
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:35,651
Half now. He'll throw you the rest after.

87
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:38,228
No stagger. Just haul ass!

88
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:44,118
No stagger?
We'll look like a circus train!

89
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:49,783
Fuckin' gorilla.

90
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:53,376
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Jim, what are you doin'?

91
00:09:53,464 --> 00:09:57,758
We can't leave a guy like this.
They'll cut his throat around here.

92
00:09:58,385 --> 00:10:00,461
So? Good.

93
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:05,509
You know what your problem is?
You're a liberal.

94
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:09,763
Ready? Let's go. Let's go!

95
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:12,015
I got a boat waitin'!

96
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,943
Where... Where's my money?

97
00:11:04,036 --> 00:11:06,112
Shut up.

98
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:30,135
What happened? What happened?

99
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:33,690
- Who took my goddamn money?
- I said shut up!

100
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,514
Shit!

101
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,074
- Step out of the truck.
- What's the problem?

102
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,195
No problem. Just step out of the truck, please.

103
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,033
- Slowly. Slowly.
- OK, I'm slow. Watch my hand.

104
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,201
Keep your hands up.

105
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,250
What's goin' on? Hey!

106
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,173
Somebody think I'm stupid or somethin'?

107
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:45,343
- Hey, fellas. How you doin'?
- Hey. What's up?

108
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,555
Mind if I see your manifest?

109
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,395
Who took my goddamn money?

110
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,901
You wanna step down outta the cab, please?

111
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,414
No!

112
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,373
- Get him!
- Shit!

113
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,677
- Run! Run!
- Go!

114
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:27,046
Go!

115
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:32,679
- Move your hand.
- No, no!

116
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:47,153
Bev...

117
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:51,411
- There was no need for a medevac on this.
- My man is down!

118
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,169
- You had no authority.
- Kiss my fuckin' ass!

119
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:57,954
You watch Calvin, all right?

120
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,389
Let me handle this.

121
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:14,264
Wow!

122
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:18,518
Does that hurt?

123
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:22,312
- What are you doing?
- Who are the mutts that took off?

124
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:24,814
No, no, no. You calm down, OK?

125
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:27,614
Hey, chill out. The DA.

126
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:31,907
That's him.

127
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:35,205
Hey.

128
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:37,371
I want the others.

129
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,884
- I don't know 'em.
- What d'you think this is, huh?

130
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:45,295
A possession of stolen property rap?

131
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,923
Your partner's dead
and you're getting charged with murder.

132
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:53,763
The shot cop - you're getting charged with
aggravated assault. You want air on this?

133
00:14:53,856 --> 00:14:56,228
Right now, give me some names.

134
00:14:56,316 --> 00:15:00,610
A guy called me, woke me up,
said he had a carrier for me to drive.

135
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:02,772
He's gonna give me $1500.

136
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:05,866
- Who called you?
- I don't know. Some guy.

137
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:08,027
Some guy, huh?

138
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:12,574
You know you're being charged
with felony murders?

139
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:15,205
That's 30 for the body, 10 more for the felony.

140
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:19,957
Do you think that the guy who called you,
if we had him here...

141
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,967
...do you think he'd do 40 years for you?

142
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:33,390
Got a family?

143
00:15:41,488 --> 00:15:43,979
I don't know the guy.

144
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:46,192
You did good, Jimmy.

145
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:50,329
- Well, what else could you do?
- What else could I have done, Jack?

146
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:55,621
I coulda done plenty. So they're talkin'
felony murder plus ten. That's bullshit, right?

147
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:58,546
They'll be happy with
a class two grand larceny.

148
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,296
All that other shit, come on!
It's thunder without lightning.

149
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:05,884
- Class two?
- Stolen property in excess of $75,000.

150
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:09,008
You'll draw five years.
Serve three, maybe two.

151
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,270
- Serve two?
- Look, you gotta take the hit.

152
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:20,900
I mean, what can I tell you
that you don't already know?

153
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:26,776
You did it, right? And they know that.
It's gonna be easy inside. It'll go like a dream.

154
00:16:26,868 --> 00:16:29,489
What happens to my family?

155
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,913
Do you have any idea what
my wife and I have been through?

156
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:35,075
Relax.

157
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:37,741
We take care of our own.

158
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,760
- $150?
- Yeah, every week, outta my own pocket.

159
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,172
What the hell can I do with $150?

160
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:53,727
Bev, it wasn't like he was pullin' down
weekly G's out there, you know?

161
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:59,981
Let's be realistic. I'm not made of money
either. I'm just tryin' to help out a little bit.

162
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,310
I can't believe this.

163
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:10,487
You know, Bev, there is another way
you could get it up a little bit.

164
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:17,035
You know, if you worked for me
at the garage - you know what I'm sayin' -

165
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:22,169
and, you know, like, run credit cards
and make appointments and stuff like that...

166
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:25,259
It'd be... you know, a strictly kosher gig.

167
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:30,260
Come on, Bev. I mean, I owe him.
I owe him big time, all right?

168
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,683
- Let me do this.
- What'd he do it for, Ronnie?

169
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,806
Bev, I swear, I don't know.

170
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,735
I mean, if that could be me in there...

171
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:50,027
- Where's the baby?
- With Rosie.

172
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,991
- How's she doin'?
- You know, she misses you.

173
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,835
Number five!

174
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:18,432
How could you do this? I can't make it
out there without you. I don't understand.

175
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:23,818
Well, I felt I had... no choice.

176
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:26,396
They were gonna kill Ronnie.

177
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,567
We were doing OK.

178
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:33,117
Didn't you think we were doing OK?

179
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:38,790
They doin' right by you?

180
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:42,589
Doin' right by me? You're in jail, Jimmy.

181
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:48,087
Number five!

182
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:57,347
- Bobby, what's the deal with this?
- It needs an 80-amp alternator, 8417 belts.

183
00:18:57,439 --> 00:19:01,651
- Fuckin' thing snapped.
- We ain't got no more? OK, I'll buy some.

184
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:06,323
- John, you cut the drums?
- Yeah, both of 'em.

185
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:08,483
Good work.

186
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:26,463
- Did the kid Terry call about the Chevys yet?
- Not yet.

187
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:28,841
Let me know, all right?

188
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:32,297
It's fuckin' hot.

189
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:37,058
It's like Tijuana out here.

190
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:41,646
Thanks. I don't drink.

191
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:46,231
- Not no more, huh?
- Not no more.

192
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:49,606
- There was a time, though, right?
- Right.

193
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:55,491
<i>Yeah, I remember. You andJimmy.
Used to be, like, partyin' every night, right?</i>

194
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,122
Well, it wasn't that long ago.

195
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,674
- Whaddaya want from me?
- Ronnie!

196
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:06,834
Ronnie!

197
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:10,338
Yo, Ronnie!

198
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:12,931
Hey, come on!

199
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:19,348
- What's the deal?
- Go ahead and ask him.

200
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:24,851
- Ask him!
- Yo. I got a '93 Infinity.

201
00:20:24,946 --> 00:20:27,318
It's fully loaded. Fully loaded.

202
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:30,361
- Oh, yeah? Is it yours?
- Yeah. Well, it is now.

203
00:20:30,952 --> 00:20:34,036
- Oh, yeah? Is that right?
- I heard you...

204
00:20:34,122 --> 00:20:38,036
You heard what?
I ain't got nothin' to do with hot cars.

205
00:20:38,126 --> 00:20:40,249
What the fuck you heard?

206
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:43,291
I was in the joint with Vinny Passo.
He told me that...

207
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:45,919
Who the fuck is Vinny Passo?

208
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:49,627
And who the fuck are you?
I don't know you. Where you from?

209
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:52,391
You know Vinny, right?

210
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:55,012
- You a cop?
- No, man. I ain't no cop.

211
00:20:55,102 --> 00:20:57,391
I was... I was in the joint with...

212
00:20:57,479 --> 00:21:00,433
We don't do that shit over here. Motherfucker!

213
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:06,938
Hold him, Johnny! Hold him.

214
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,987
Come here! Where you goin'? Come here!

215
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:22,620
What the fuck d'ya think this is?

216
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:26,047
Get that car outta here! That one too.

217
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:33,965
Closin' up! Out! Out!

218
00:21:36,978 --> 00:21:40,928
I'm fuckin' upset! So fuckin' upset!
I can't take this bullshit.

219
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:44,025
Come on, I'm gonna
drive you home. Let's go.

220
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:46,483
Let's go. Let me get this.

221
00:22:01,295 --> 00:22:04,794
- Where are we goin'?
- Come on. I gotta go see somebody.

222
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:07,792
I'll buy you a soda pop, all right?

223
00:22:07,885 --> 00:22:09,961
24.

224
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:14,173
25.

225
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,508
Nice and easy.

226
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,769
- 26.
- Jesus, what you been eatin'?

227
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:22,347
Come on, you faggot. 27.

228
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,434
- 28.
- Come on, Junior.

229
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:27,604
29.

230
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,856
- 30.
- Oh, fuck.

231
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,025
31.

232
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,911
A vodka straight. For her, whatever.

233
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:40,573
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

234
00:22:43,588 --> 00:22:45,664
37.

235
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:49,175
Pop! Pop! I'm goin' for forty.

236
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:51,419
Watch!

237
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:54,550
- 38.
- You got it. You got it. Come on!

238
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,717
- 39.
- Come on!

239
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,886
And...

240
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:01,055
...40!

241
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,439
- He did it.
- That was great! I knew you had it in you.

242
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:16,989
- What's due?
- It's all there.

243
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:23,287
- Who's she?
- That's my cousin's wife.

244
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,208
- You givin' her the money?
- Yeah. $400 a week like you said.

245
00:23:29,302 --> 00:23:32,718
Plus, I'm giving her a job.
You know, that was my idea.

246
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:39,009
- Throw her a car too.
- A car?

247
00:23:39,104 --> 00:23:41,310
- Mm-hm.
- OK.

248
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:43,891
Is that it?

249
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:46,685
All right.

250
00:23:57,331 --> 00:23:59,407
Hey, what's the what?

251
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,454
What kinda car you like to drive?

252
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:04,751
- What kind?
- Yeah.

253
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:07,380
Listen...

254
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:12,838
I wanna give you a car.

255
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,717
I wanna do somethin' nice for you.

256
00:24:17,977 --> 00:24:21,227
<i>- You wanna do something nice for me?
- Yeah.</i>

257
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:26,478
- Feel good?
- My father says to take her home.

258
00:24:29,572 --> 00:24:33,155
- Why don't you let her finish her drink first?
- Now, fucko!

259
00:24:35,578 --> 00:24:40,122
- Why you gotta talk to me like that, man?
- To her house.

260
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:42,415
Come on, let's go.

261
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:17,822
Rosie, I'm sorry. I fell asleep. Is Corinna OK?

262
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:22,452
No, I'm coming home.
I'm coming home right now.

263
00:25:22,543 --> 00:25:24,619
OK.

264
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,799
Oh, look who's up.

265
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:34,963
Fuck off!

266
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:05,377
Jimmy!

267
00:26:12,678 --> 00:26:14,754
Kilmartin.

268
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,731
Come in. I'll be off in a minute.

269
00:26:37,954 --> 00:26:40,659
Oh, Bev, no! Oh, no...

270
00:26:44,544 --> 00:26:47,664
She was a beautiful person, man.

271
00:26:48,965 --> 00:26:51,042
I did everything I could for her.

272
00:26:52,553 --> 00:26:54,629
I'm sorry.

273
00:26:55,472 --> 00:26:59,850
What was she doin' in your car
at eight in the morning, Ronnie?

274
00:27:00,894 --> 00:27:04,643
I sent her from the shop
to get somethin' from my house.

275
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:08,811
- We were workin'...
- To get what?

276
00:27:13,115 --> 00:27:15,404
To get my wallet.

277
00:27:17,328 --> 00:27:19,700
To get your wallet?

278
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:29,164
Jimmy, I swear, if that could be me in there...
I wouldn't have done it, man, cos I...

279
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:31,333
- Let's go.
- We were workin'.

280
00:27:31,426 --> 00:27:34,593
- Wait a second. Wait.
- Let's go.

281
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,004
Could Rosie bring Corinna to see me?

282
00:27:37,182 --> 00:27:40,800
- You know, it was you, drivin' that truck.
- Don't say that.

283
00:27:40,894 --> 00:27:43,599
Now I got nobody.

284
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:46,262
Come on. Time to go.

285
00:27:49,486 --> 00:27:52,570
On the morning she died,
what time did Bev go to work?

286
00:27:52,656 --> 00:27:56,440
- I'm... not sure.
- Rosie, let me put it to you another way.

287
00:27:56,535 --> 00:28:00,615
What time did you come downstairs
so she could go to work? Six A.M.., seven A.M.?

288
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:02,782
Ah, Jimmy...

289
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:11,958
She never even made it home
from the night before.

290
00:28:14,053 --> 00:28:19,213
She called me from work, says
Ronnie's drivin' her, but she never made it.

291
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:21,799
Jimmy, she never made it.

292
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:25,643
- Ronnie.
- I was there all night. All night long.

293
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:28,223
- Ronnie.
- Let's go.

294
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:32,487
OK.

295
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:39,030
- Your wallet, Ronnie? Your wallet?
- Come on!

296
00:28:39,955 --> 00:28:40,986
Come on!

297
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:44,781
<i>- Now you're giving me names?
- You want 'em or not?</i>

298
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:46,999
<i>What do you want? Early parole?</i>

299
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:51,714
If I give people up to you and you turn me
loose early, I won't last day one out there.

300
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,418
- So what do you want?
- I wanna visit my daughter.

301
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,012
She's livin' upstate with my mother-in-law,
who won't let her come and see me.

302
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:07,148
And I want a one-day trip
to go up there and see her. One day.

303
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:16,031
- No.
- Whaddaya want from me?

304
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:20,287
What do you mean? Like, in addition?

305
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:23,780
Tell me something. Surprise me.

306
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:30,793
Astro Jewelers. Remember that?

307
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:34,426
- Four years ago.
- Mm-hm.

308
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:37,638
I give you those people, I get my day.

309
00:29:40,308 --> 00:29:42,634
We'll see.

310
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:47,103
John Amato. Call him Johnny A.

311
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,026
And Bobby Bannion: Bobby B.

312
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,731
They work at L&M Automotive
near Shea Stadium.

313
00:29:52,821 --> 00:29:55,822
- Anybody else?
- You should pick me up too.

314
00:29:55,908 --> 00:29:58,862
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- Well, if you don't...

315
00:29:58,952 --> 00:30:01,278
...they'll know who did the talking.

316
00:30:02,331 --> 00:30:05,202
So, throw me in a line-up.
I'll take my chances.

317
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:08,325
That's all I have to say about this.

318
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:15,252
Tell me about the navy yard.

319
00:30:16,596 --> 00:30:20,463
Same guys: Johnny A, Bobby B and me.

320
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,176
That's three. There were four transporters.

321
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:32,528
I didn't know the fourth driver.
I never saw him before.

322
00:30:32,612 --> 00:30:34,901
Who called you?

323
00:30:38,785 --> 00:30:42,035
Yo... Mr. Money.

324
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:49,665
There is no way that you can tell me that you
did not know the guy who got you into this.

325
00:30:52,507 --> 00:30:55,045
Look me in the eye and try it.

326
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:01,973
I've got no reason to lie.

327
00:31:04,478 --> 00:31:07,183
Everybody's got a reason to lie.

328
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,985
Astro Jewelers? That was four years ago.

329
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:14,477
Who ratted us out?

330
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,526
Well, whoever it was, you're in the clear.

331
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:22,160
I was the driver. The guy never laid eyes
on me. Did they pick Ronnie up too?

332
00:31:23,706 --> 00:31:27,075
- Ronnie Gannon?
- Yeah. The whole job was his idea.

333
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:30,205
No, his name didn't even come up.

334
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:33,582
Did the prosecutor's office
contact you about this?

335
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:37,673
No. How stupid do ya think I am?
I wouldn't talk to anybody without you.

336
00:31:40,307 --> 00:31:44,684
Yeah. Well, they also got picked up
on the navy yard thing.

337
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,687
- Who did?
- Bobby and Johnny.

338
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:50,687
Ronnie too?

339
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:57,479
- Ronnie Gannon...
- I never liked that kid.

340
00:31:57,574 --> 00:32:00,528
He's a fuckin' rat, is what you're sayin'.

341
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:05,661
You gonna take care of this,
Junior, or are you goin' outta house?

342
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:08,990
I clean up my own mess.

343
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:44,198
- You ever see a Rolls get chopped?
- No.

344
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:47,160
Why don't you stay and check it out?

345
00:32:49,211 --> 00:32:52,627
Come on, man.
I'm dyin' over here. Let's go!

346
00:32:55,884 --> 00:33:01,923
We ain't got all day, man. Let's go, man.
It ain't rocket science. Let's get outta here!

347
00:33:05,978 --> 00:33:10,272
Let's go to work. Let's get it up!

348
00:33:12,234 --> 00:33:14,310
Yo, Ronnie!

349
00:33:14,403 --> 00:33:17,238
Ronnie! Come here!

350
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:40,423
What the fuck?
You guys look like the Gorton's fishermen.

351
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:45,633
Ronnie, I want you to listen to this.

352
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:48,598
An oldie but goodie.

353
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:51,559
Concentrate on the words.

354
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:04,277
Did ya hear that?

355
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:07,206
Yeah. The bass was too heavy, though.

356
00:34:10,211 --> 00:34:14,789
"The time has come for everyone
to clean up their own back yard."

357
00:34:18,427 --> 00:34:21,879
"Clean up their own back yard."

358
00:34:22,515 --> 00:34:24,175
Did you hear that?

359
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:27,434
Wait! What'd I do?

360
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,596
I didn't do nothin'! What'd I do?

361
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:35,857
You got somethin' to say?
You like to talk to the cops, huh?

362
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:38,021
Huh?

363
00:34:38,657 --> 00:34:42,026
You like to fuckin' talk, you fuck? You fuck!

364
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:01,635
Shit, Junior.

365
00:35:01,722 --> 00:35:03,845
- Shit.
- Ow.

366
00:35:06,393 --> 00:35:08,469
I like this. I really do.

367
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:19,899
Ah, man, look at this. I just bought this thing.

368
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:36,330
Let's get him outta here.

369
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:59,401
- Kilmartin. On a day pass.
- Change your clothes in the cage.

370
00:36:07,873 --> 00:36:11,040
Mr. Kilmartin. We meet again.

371
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,373
You remember old Calvin Hart here, don't ya?

372
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,128
He sure as shit remembers you.

373
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:02,758
Take the cuffs off him.

374
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:11,888
Took the same bullet as you.

375
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:49,675
Can I see my daughter now?

376
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:17,871
- Hi.
- What happened to your face?

377
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:21,833
Nothin'. Listen,
I don't think this is such a good idea.

378
00:38:21,928 --> 00:38:24,253
I don't want her to see me like this.

379
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,255
Oh, Jimmy, she's a baby. She don't...

380
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:39,776
- She ask for Bev a lot?
- In and out.

381
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:43,528
Between me and Bev's mom,
she's doin' better than you think.

382
00:38:43,617 --> 00:38:48,029
I've been takin' her to classes with me.
She likes psych and economics.

383
00:38:48,121 --> 00:38:50,197
Math...

384
00:38:50,749 --> 00:38:54,996
That's great. I don't know
what I'd do without you, Rosie.

385
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:09,342
Corinna.

386
00:39:18,778 --> 00:39:20,106
Hey.

387
00:39:20,196 --> 00:39:22,817
Hey, you! Hey.

388
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:28,284
Hey, you, come here.
Corinna, do you know who I am?

389
00:39:28,371 --> 00:39:30,660
Just for one minute.

390
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:35,118
I know.

391
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:38,706
Ma-ma-ma...

392
00:39:41,301 --> 00:39:43,377
OK. All right.

393
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:53,141
Don't take her away from me.

394
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:16,087
Daddy, it stinks in here.

395
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:19,376
It smells like soup!

396
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:24,465
Soup, huh?

397
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:26,630
Three more weeks.

398
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:29,510
Hang in there, kiddo.

399
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:31,427
Yeah...

400
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,639
Comin' out to what? No job, no money...

401
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:39,061
Least I got you, Juicy, right? Yeah.

402
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:42,647
I wanna get your parents somethin'
for getting my apartment back.

403
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:46,025
- And you got me.
- Whaddaya mean, I got you?

404
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:03,009
Give it up!

405
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:06,794
Kilmartin, report to the five building bypass.

406
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:08,716
Kilmartin!

407
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:33,407
Come on in.

408
00:41:46,888 --> 00:41:50,838
I hear you're comin' up
for parole review next week.

409
00:41:50,934 --> 00:41:54,019
I also hear you've been a pretty good guy.
That's great.

410
00:41:54,104 --> 00:41:56,180
Whaddaya want?

411
00:41:58,025 --> 00:42:03,019
Did you ever hear of an asshole
by the name of Little Junior Brown?

412
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,904
Think.

413
00:42:11,622 --> 00:42:13,247
What about him?

414
00:42:16,836 --> 00:42:18,496
Little Junior...

415
00:42:18,588 --> 00:42:21,624
His old man, Big Junior?

416
00:42:21,716 --> 00:42:24,421
He's in the hospital. He ain't comin' out.

417
00:42:25,178 --> 00:42:28,760
So it looks like Little Junior's
movin' up in the world.

418
00:42:30,892 --> 00:42:32,968
Big Junior.

419
00:42:33,061 --> 00:42:37,059
That's one of those expressions like...
jumbo shrimp.

420
00:42:37,857 --> 00:42:39,933
Huh?

421
00:42:43,113 --> 00:42:45,355
Listen to me.

422
00:42:45,448 --> 00:42:49,612
I am not goin' back to that.
I am not rattin' on anybody else.

423
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:52,455
What's done is done.
You can't make me do shit.

424
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:55,624
We never swung the hammer on you
for the Astro job.

425
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:58,995
Get the indictment on me.
Look, all I got to say to you...

426
00:42:59,087 --> 00:43:03,132
...is how you already cooperated with us
ratting out the others...

427
00:43:03,217 --> 00:43:07,345
...and here we are droppin' it on you anyhow
because you won't do any more ratting.

428
00:43:07,429 --> 00:43:09,920
You know what? You're right.

429
00:43:10,015 --> 00:43:13,598
Forget it.
We probably won't get the indictment.

430
00:43:15,187 --> 00:43:17,725
And you'll be out on the street.

431
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:21,807
A free man.

432
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:26,066
How long do you think you're gonna
last out there once the word gets out?

433
00:43:32,372 --> 00:43:34,448
Are you a man of honor?

434
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:38,035
Sure.

435
00:43:38,712 --> 00:43:40,788
See, let me tell you.

436
00:43:41,673 --> 00:43:48,672
All I want now is what I had in my life
before all the fuckers came through the door -

437
00:43:48,764 --> 00:43:50,840
you and them.

438
00:43:51,683 --> 00:43:56,226
I wanna be left alone with my family,
and I want a job that feels good to me.

439
00:43:56,313 --> 00:44:00,145
So if that means I need to deliver up
this Junior Brown, I'll do that.

440
00:44:00,234 --> 00:44:03,817
If I have to kill this motherfucker to get there,
I will.

441
00:44:03,904 --> 00:44:06,360
But all I've got on you is your word.

442
00:44:06,448 --> 00:44:09,366
So I'm asking you: if I serve him up...

443
00:44:10,786 --> 00:44:17,204
...as a man of honor, will you say to me now
that you will cut me loose once and for all?

444
00:44:18,544 --> 00:44:20,620
Absolutely.

445
00:44:21,714 --> 00:44:24,501
D'you want my hand on it or something?

446
00:44:38,898 --> 00:44:40,974
OK, let him pass.

447
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,867
James Kilmartin.

448
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,332
- Rose D'Amico.
- Here.

449
00:45:00,963 --> 00:45:03,288
That's my daddy!

450
00:45:05,175 --> 00:45:07,251
Let's go.

451
00:45:21,943 --> 00:45:24,019
- Daddy, look!
- Hey, Corinna!

452
00:45:25,696 --> 00:45:29,113
What the hell's the matter with you?!

453
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:34,413
The car almost hit me, Daddy.

454
00:45:34,497 --> 00:45:36,573
I know.

455
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:50,509
- What the fuck is your problem, man?
- My father's dead!

456
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:52,923
My father's dead!

457
00:45:54,434 --> 00:45:56,890
Come on, get it out. Come on.

458
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,103
Argh!

459
00:46:37,103 --> 00:46:39,594
See the brother here with Junior?

460
00:46:39,689 --> 00:46:44,351
His name's Omar. Now, Omar's down
with some posse outta Philadelphia.

461
00:46:44,444 --> 00:46:49,023
Must got cash as long as train smoke
cos he's Junior's biggest customer.

462
00:46:49,116 --> 00:46:53,861
Cars, drugs, guns. He's buyin'
everything he can get his hands on.

463
00:46:54,496 --> 00:46:59,407
So when you hook up with your scumbag
pals, I want you to get 'em talkin' about Omar.

464
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:03,084
He must be new. The Philadelphia PD
ain't got no jacket on him yet.

465
00:47:03,172 --> 00:47:05,248
Wait.

466
00:47:05,966 --> 00:47:08,837
Fuck this guy Omar. You said Little Junior.

467
00:47:08,928 --> 00:47:11,216
<i>This is about Little Junior.</i>

468
00:47:12,348 --> 00:47:17,888
Look, like if you get in some conversations,
just relax. Don't push for nothin', all right?

469
00:47:17,979 --> 00:47:22,973
Guy starts talkin', just ask for more details,
but nice and natural.

470
00:47:23,067 --> 00:47:25,143
Two assholes talkin' shop.

471
00:47:25,236 --> 00:47:30,479
But don't push, all right?
And don't initiate nothin', all right?

472
00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:37,031
Yeah, you gonna be fine. Just fine.

473
00:47:38,124 --> 00:47:40,794
Look, we in this together, man.

474
00:47:40,877 --> 00:47:43,249
One for all, all for one, right?

475
00:47:52,055 --> 00:47:54,427
OK, slow down. Slow.

476
00:47:57,769 --> 00:48:00,724
There it is. There. The Lexus, right there.

477
00:49:11,387 --> 00:49:15,135
I hate dogs! Little dogs, big dogs...

478
00:49:15,224 --> 00:49:17,300
Let's get outta here.

479
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:43,658
See that guy in the red shirt over there?

480
00:49:44,921 --> 00:49:48,586
- This guy right over here?
- That's our connect in the DMV.

481
00:49:49,134 --> 00:49:53,926
Alls we gotta do is throw him a license
number, throws us back anything we need.

482
00:49:54,014 --> 00:49:57,846
Sometimes we got more shit
than the real owners. It's beautiful.

483
00:49:57,935 --> 00:49:59,892
No kiddin'.

484
00:50:00,104 --> 00:50:02,180
No kiddin'.

485
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:18,029
Now, you see her? The Indian? I just love her.

486
00:50:18,122 --> 00:50:21,705
<i>- She's nice.
- No, I love her. We're engaged.</i>

487
00:50:22,752 --> 00:50:27,129
I wanna grow old with her and shit.
You know what I'm tryin' to say?

488
00:50:34,472 --> 00:50:37,557
You remember me?

489
00:50:37,642 --> 00:50:39,718
Yeah.

490
00:50:46,151 --> 00:50:48,938
I heard you lost your wife.

491
00:50:49,321 --> 00:50:51,776
I lost my father last week.

492
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,359
Whaddaya think is worse?

493
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,946
Losin' a wife or losin' a father?

494
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:06,037
I don't know.

495
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:11,425
I guess it depends on the individual,
the relationship, whatnot.

496
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:17,306
You know what an asthma attack feels like?

497
00:51:19,435 --> 00:51:23,433
Feels like you're tryin' to breathe air
through a flattened straw.

498
00:51:23,523 --> 00:51:28,149
But if I take a hit of this, most times I'm OK.

499
00:51:28,486 --> 00:51:30,562
Like that.

500
00:51:31,573 --> 00:51:34,242
But my old man?

501
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:36,401
In the end?

502
00:51:39,914 --> 00:51:43,533
He had less than five per cent
of his lung capacity.

503
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:50,507
I mean... he went out hard.

504
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,711
I'm sorry to hear that.

505
00:51:55,889 --> 00:52:00,385
If that starts happenin' with me -
with genetics and shit - it's silver-bullet time.

506
00:52:00,477 --> 00:52:02,636
I'll do it myself.

507
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:10,897
At least your wife, she went out fast, right?

508
00:52:12,323 --> 00:52:16,155
I'm tellin' ya, man,
you gotta be grateful for that.

509
00:52:17,703 --> 00:52:20,408
So, Sing Sing... You got through that.

510
00:52:24,085 --> 00:52:27,454
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, right?

511
00:52:27,547 --> 00:52:28,578
Whatever...?

512
00:52:28,673 --> 00:52:31,081
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

513
00:52:31,342 --> 00:52:33,964
Whatever don't kill you makes...

514
00:52:34,053 --> 00:52:36,129
I like that.

515
00:52:39,476 --> 00:52:42,393
- You're OK.
- Joey, get this guy!

516
00:52:42,479 --> 00:52:45,812
- You're all right.
- Hey!

517
00:52:45,899 --> 00:52:48,900
- What are you doin'? Come here.
- Hey, man. Come on!

518
00:52:48,985 --> 00:52:51,274
Bring him here.

519
00:52:57,327 --> 00:53:00,779
<i>Junior, I'm drunk. I was drunk. I'm sorry.</i>

520
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:03,364
Which hand did you grab her with?

521
00:53:04,418 --> 00:53:08,001
Put it on the table.
I'm only gonna say that once.

522
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:19,012
Would you mind lightin'
one of those for me, please?

523
00:53:39,704 --> 00:53:41,578
- Thank you.
- Junior...

524
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:44,784
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

525
00:53:45,627 --> 00:53:48,581
You think that's an easy job,
dancin' up there?

526
00:53:48,672 --> 00:53:52,123
It's hard, what they do. Are you kiddin' me?

527
00:53:52,217 --> 00:53:55,752
- Junior...
- Don't you move that fuckin' hand.

528
00:53:56,763 --> 00:53:59,848
When someone steps over the line...

529
00:53:59,933 --> 00:54:04,346
...the difficult becomes
the repulsively impossible.

530
00:54:05,189 --> 00:54:08,772
I think you should have more respect
for what they put up with.

531
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:11,350
<i>So what can I do...</i>

532
00:54:12,404 --> 00:54:14,978
...to make you remember...

533
00:54:15,074 --> 00:54:18,609
...and appreciate...

534
00:54:19,453 --> 00:54:22,822
...what that's like, bein' up there?

535
00:54:26,961 --> 00:54:29,037
Please...

536
00:54:39,432 --> 00:54:41,508
Come here.

537
00:54:41,685 --> 00:54:43,761
Come on, come on.

538
00:54:44,854 --> 00:54:46,931
Get over here!

539
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:09,250
Tonight, I'll tell you, you have
really got this thing down to a science.

540
00:55:09,338 --> 00:55:11,414
Yeah? What thing?

541
00:55:11,507 --> 00:55:14,627
Well, look at him.
Who would know? Am I right?

542
00:55:18,055 --> 00:55:20,546
Who would know what?

543
00:55:22,101 --> 00:55:25,850
No, I'm just... I'm just saying. You know.

544
00:55:25,938 --> 00:55:28,180
Admirin'.

545
00:55:28,274 --> 00:55:30,066
Admirin'?

546
00:55:50,088 --> 00:55:52,710
Get him the fuck off there.

547
00:56:08,607 --> 00:56:12,771
I am so fuckin' stupid.
I should have my fuckin' head examined.

548
00:56:13,821 --> 00:56:16,692
What is the matter with me?

549
00:56:28,503 --> 00:56:30,910
Hey! Hey! What are you fuckin' doin'?

550
00:56:31,005 --> 00:56:34,255
What are you worrying
about the guy for, huh?!

551
00:56:35,176 --> 00:56:37,548
What guy? What fucking guy?

552
00:56:38,805 --> 00:56:40,881
Whaddaya wanna know for?

553
00:56:40,974 --> 00:56:43,761
That's fucking great.
I did three years for you.

554
00:56:43,852 --> 00:56:45,928
Hey, hey, hey.

555
00:56:46,396 --> 00:56:49,812
I did three years for you,
you paranoid motherfucker, OK?

556
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,901
<i>Full time, not a day less, for you.</i>

557
00:56:52,986 --> 00:56:55,062
OK?

558
00:56:55,697 --> 00:56:58,319
What do you wanna know about the guy for?

559
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:05,661
JJ pointed him out to me,
like two minutes before you sat down.

560
00:57:05,749 --> 00:57:11,289
If he's got a big fuckin' mouth, take it up
with him. I was tryin' to make conversation.

561
00:57:20,222 --> 00:57:22,630
It's been a hard week.

562
00:57:25,394 --> 00:57:28,431
I'm sorry. I just lost control, you know, so...

563
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:31,524
Wanna go for a ride?

564
00:57:31,609 --> 00:57:33,649
Let's go for a ride. Come on.

565
00:57:33,736 --> 00:57:35,812
No problem.

566
00:57:39,951 --> 00:57:42,027
Know what an acronym is?

567
00:57:45,999 --> 00:57:51,954
It's like letters that stand for things.
You know, like FBI, TGIF. You understand?

568
00:57:52,881 --> 00:57:54,957
Yeah.

569
00:57:56,385 --> 00:58:00,003
I have an acronym for myself.
Know what it is?

570
00:58:02,808 --> 00:58:06,177
B-A-D.

571
00:58:07,271 --> 00:58:13,808
B-A-D. Balls, attitude, direction.

572
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:21,442
You should give yourself an acronym.
Cos it helps you visualize your goals.

573
00:58:24,664 --> 00:58:28,412
How about F-A-B? Fucked at birth.

574
00:58:32,922 --> 00:58:34,879
No good. Too negative.

575
00:58:45,268 --> 00:58:48,684
There's a bag in the trunk.
Why don't ya get it?

576
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:10,118
Whoa! Omar.

577
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:13,081
Don't you be fuckin'
sneakin' up on me like that.

578
00:59:13,172 --> 00:59:16,921
Shit! Maybe you oughta
lighten up on the yeyo some.

579
00:59:18,052 --> 00:59:19,795
<i>And you think I'm paranoid...</i>

580
00:59:19,887 --> 00:59:22,841
- Who the fuck is this?
- He's cool. He's my people.

581
00:59:22,932 --> 00:59:25,803
Your people?
Turn the fuck around, motherfucker.

582
00:59:25,893 --> 00:59:27,969
Omar, the cars.

583
00:59:32,483 --> 00:59:35,437
Yeah, man. You got the titles and shit?

584
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:37,604
Always do.

585
00:59:39,491 --> 00:59:43,073
All right, I'll take 'em all. Except that Explorer.

586
00:59:43,828 --> 00:59:46,236
What's the matter with the Explorer?

587
00:59:47,165 --> 00:59:49,241
It's...

588
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:52,828
It's red.

589
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:56,382
- So have 'em paint it.
- No. No, man.

590
00:59:56,466 --> 00:59:59,752
No, it'd still be red under the paint.

591
01:00:00,345 --> 01:00:04,011
Red's my bad luck color.
I ain't got nothin' to do with red.

592
01:00:06,977 --> 01:00:09,515
You're some funny people, my man.

593
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:14,478
- You got them nines for me?
- Right here.

594
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,688
Are you interested in Macs?
I'll get you a dozen.

595
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,453
Macs? Yeah, man. I'll take Macs. Yeah.

596
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,613
You got 'em.

597
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,582
This motherfucker smells scared, Junior.

598
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,923
I don't like that.

599
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,500
You wanna dance with me?

600
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,518
Cos I love to dance.

601
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,891
You hear what I'm sayin'?

602
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,222
No more new fuckin' faces, all right?

603
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,607
Whatever.

604
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:23,885
How about you? You afraid of red?

605
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:27,349
What am I, an interior decorator?
I don't give a shit.

606
01:01:27,435 --> 01:01:29,724
Good. The Explorer's yours.

607
01:02:06,767 --> 01:02:09,139
Jimmy. Over here.

608
01:02:17,069 --> 01:02:19,525
These are the cars we took.

609
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:22,615
Where'd they go? Terminator Body Parts?

610
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:23,898
Got anything else?

611
01:02:23,993 --> 01:02:26,780
There was a guy from the DMV there.
I couldn't get his name.

612
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:29,658
Yeah, we onto him.
So you hook up with Junior?

613
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:30,780
Oh, yeah.

614
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:33,995
- And how about Omar? You cut in Omar?
- Him too.

615
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:39,461
Bought everything on the sheet, bag of nines,
goin' for a dozen Macs over the weekend.

616
01:02:39,551 --> 01:02:41,378
All right.

617
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:44,589
- So I'll get that wire off you.
- I threw it away.

618
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,801
What?

619
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:50,343
I threw it away.
I got patted down twice tonight.

620
01:02:52,564 --> 01:02:55,399
So you're all right with him.
That'll make it easier.

621
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:59,102
- Easier for what?
- Easier to wear a fuckin' wire.

622
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:04,865
Let me ask you a question. Why you?

623
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:08,489
<i>Why did they put you on me? Revenge?</i>

624
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:11,454
You see this eye here?

625
01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:14,745
Runs all the time. I can't make it stop.

626
01:03:14,837 --> 01:03:17,672
I got a third of my hearin' in this ear.

627
01:03:17,757 --> 01:03:22,300
When I wanna go to the beach - take my kids
to the beach and play with 'em and shit -

628
01:03:22,386 --> 01:03:26,515
strong, direct sun gives me a migraine
so bad, I cry like a baby.

629
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:29,434
They don't know why. It just does.

630
01:03:30,103 --> 01:03:32,510
So I asked for you.

631
01:03:33,439 --> 01:03:39,193
And if you take that wire off one more time,
I'm personally gonna beat you to death.

632
01:03:41,072 --> 01:03:45,734
Maybe the next time you lay a hand on me
it won't be such a one-way beatin'.

633
01:03:55,087 --> 01:03:57,126
Hi.

634
01:04:01,343 --> 01:04:03,632
What you got, a test?

635
01:04:05,848 --> 01:04:08,553
Are you gonna get locked up again?

636
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:11,934
No.

637
01:04:12,021 --> 01:04:15,224
- You would never do that to me.
- No.

638
01:04:15,316 --> 01:04:18,021
Cos I'm not Bev. I can't live with that.

639
01:04:23,157 --> 01:04:25,565
She couldn't live with it either.

640
01:04:48,683 --> 01:04:51,850
You got something you need to tell me?

641
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:01,315
I'm under the rock.
They got me wearin' a wire.

642
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:10,575
Funny thing is,
I liked boostin' cars, you know?

643
01:05:10,664 --> 01:05:14,199
There wasn't any make or model
I couldn't pop the lock.

644
01:05:14,585 --> 01:05:18,453
Kill the alarm,
get it on the road in 90 seconds.

645
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,799
And it felt good.
It felt good to be good at somethin'.

646
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:28,216
I had money in my pocket,
nice clothes, flash ride...

647
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:35,894
Buy things for Bev, you know?
Take her places.

648
01:05:38,943 --> 01:05:41,019
Felt good.

649
01:05:43,949 --> 01:05:46,237
But it was bullshit.

650
01:05:47,619 --> 01:05:51,831
And when I finally got caught... goin' to jail...

651
01:05:53,542 --> 01:05:55,784
That's for real.

652
01:05:57,796 --> 01:06:01,046
DA's office, Wednesday, 8 P.M..

653
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:03,754
Mrs. Wang's restaurant, wiring subject.

654
01:06:09,683 --> 01:06:12,601
Switch the ID plate with the junker's.
Torch the junker.

655
01:06:12,686 --> 01:06:14,762
Cops'll think it's the new car.

656
01:06:48,932 --> 01:06:50,426
Let's go.

657
01:06:50,517 --> 01:06:52,177
Wait.

658
01:06:56,565 --> 01:06:57,763
Ooh!

659
01:06:57,858 --> 01:07:01,690
I always get such a kick outta that.
It's the kid in me.

660
01:07:18,713 --> 01:07:20,705
- Hi.
- Hey.

661
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:23,503
Ugh! You smell like gasoline.

662
01:07:23,593 --> 01:07:26,297
He's a workin' man, babe. Give him a break.

663
01:07:30,808 --> 01:07:32,267
- I gotta go.
- Where?

664
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:34,973
Gotta get home. She'll have my ass. So...

665
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,771
Let's go.

666
01:07:48,702 --> 01:07:49,982
What's up?

667
01:07:50,078 --> 01:07:54,491
You don't know who to fucking trust
these days. Know what I mean?

668
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:01,795
Junior, what?

669
01:08:01,882 --> 01:08:04,254
What's up? I do somethin'?

670
01:08:19,734 --> 01:08:23,731
Walk over there
and ask him if he wants a Rolls.

671
01:08:23,821 --> 01:08:25,695
Tell him it's red.

672
01:08:26,032 --> 01:08:28,653
Oh, come on, Junior. Don't make me do that.

673
01:08:34,415 --> 01:08:36,989
And come up on the passenger side.

674
01:09:03,403 --> 01:09:05,811
Hey. How you doin'?

675
01:09:08,033 --> 01:09:09,492
What the fuck y'all want?

676
01:09:14,707 --> 01:09:16,783
Oh, my God.

677
01:09:17,293 --> 01:09:19,700
Oh, my God!

678
01:09:19,795 --> 01:09:21,871
You killed him.

679
01:09:23,299 --> 01:09:26,502
- Have some coke on me.
- Jesus.

680
01:09:27,553 --> 01:09:29,760
Jesus.

681
01:09:29,972 --> 01:09:32,642
What did you do? What did you do?

682
01:09:36,145 --> 01:09:38,601
What the fuck did you do?

683
01:09:45,655 --> 01:09:48,111
What did I do?

684
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:52,447
You fuck with the bull, you get the horns.
That's what I did.

685
01:09:58,168 --> 01:10:02,036
Come up with a more positive
acronym for yourself yet?

686
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:04,584
A what?

687
01:10:07,302 --> 01:10:12,807
You know what I hate more than anything?
I hate the taste of metal in my mouth.

688
01:10:12,892 --> 01:10:18,728
Silverware makes me gag. I've gotta use
plastic forks and spoons all the time.

689
01:10:34,706 --> 01:10:36,782
You know, I...

690
01:10:37,458 --> 01:10:41,456
...I never told anybody about
me and the metal taste thing before.

691
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:48,795
Tomorrow... fuck the cars.

692
01:10:49,262 --> 01:10:51,588
Just come by the bar.

693
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:54,842
I want you to... We...

694
01:10:56,103 --> 01:10:59,803
We should have a conversation
about life and shit.

695
01:11:19,919 --> 01:11:22,291
Yeah, get me Calvin Hart.

696
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:31,095
- I didn't do nothin'.
- I'd like to blow your fuckin' head off.

697
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:47,896
I didn't do it!

698
01:13:07,404 --> 01:13:09,730
Bullshit!

699
01:13:11,492 --> 01:13:14,197
No, I am not gonna talk to you!

700
01:13:15,454 --> 01:13:18,657
Just keep your fuckin' mouth shut, all right?

701
01:13:20,793 --> 01:13:24,043
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
Omar was a federal agent?

702
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:25,790
He was a what?

703
01:13:26,299 --> 01:13:29,549
We couldn't compromise our investigation.

704
01:13:29,969 --> 01:13:32,756
- He was a what?!
- Your investigation?

705
01:13:32,847 --> 01:13:36,596
It's called common courtesy.
It's called professionalism!

706
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:38,926
You arrogant prick!

707
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:42,555
- What a fucking waste of time!
- What?! Our man was killed...

708
01:13:42,649 --> 01:13:44,641
...and your confidential
informant's a witness!

709
01:13:44,734 --> 01:13:48,779
Well, maybe your man would still be alive
if you'd bothered to let us in on it.

710
01:13:48,864 --> 01:13:51,948
- Yeah, it's your own damn fault.
- Our fault?! Let me tell you...

711
01:13:53,785 --> 01:13:57,119
- Your CI is ours.
- The fuck he is!

712
01:13:57,831 --> 01:14:01,081
Oh, yeah?
Then I'm chargin' him with homicide.

713
01:14:01,168 --> 01:14:03,125
Fuck you!

714
01:14:03,754 --> 01:14:06,589
You're not doin' shit.
I'll go to the US attorney.

715
01:14:06,673 --> 01:14:10,541
Once they find out that the guy
you're tryin' to indict is a state-run CI...

716
01:14:10,636 --> 01:14:12,925
...that you knew about from day one...

717
01:14:13,013 --> 01:14:16,098
...holy shit, what happens to you?!

718
01:14:16,183 --> 01:14:18,555
You ever read about yourself in the paper?

719
01:14:18,644 --> 01:14:21,515
Your balls shrivel to the size of chickpeas.

720
01:14:23,065 --> 01:14:24,725
So whaddaya want?

721
01:14:25,067 --> 01:14:27,938
- Stop. Talk to me. I'm right here.
- Shut up.

722
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:31,279
I want in. I want a joint prosecution,
state and federal...

723
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:33,157
...and I want this in state court.

724
01:14:33,242 --> 01:14:35,734
- Federal.
- State!

725
01:14:35,828 --> 01:14:38,913
Federal's what I'll give you,
federal's what you'll get.

726
01:14:38,998 --> 01:14:40,872
- State court!
- Federal.

727
01:14:45,797 --> 01:14:48,502
I am right here. Talk to me.

728
01:14:48,592 --> 01:14:51,427
<i>What the fuck y'all want?</i>

729
01:14:52,304 --> 01:14:54,380
<i> Oh, my God.</i>

730
01:14:54,848 --> 01:14:57,256
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

731
01:14:57,351 --> 01:14:58,845
<i>You killed him.</i>

732
01:14:58,936 --> 01:15:00,975
<i>- Have some coke on me.
- Jesus.</i>

733
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:03,221
<i>Jesus.</i>

734
01:15:03,315 --> 01:15:06,067
<i>What did you do? What did you do?</i>

735
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:08,857
<i>What the fuck did you do?</i>

736
01:15:09,697 --> 01:15:13,481
<i>You fuck with the bull, you get the horns.
That's what I did.</i>

737
01:15:15,411 --> 01:15:18,910
- You finished with me now?
- You gotta be dreaming.

738
01:15:47,944 --> 01:15:50,270
You're under arrest, motherfucker.

739
01:15:52,073 --> 01:15:54,399
State or federal?

740
01:15:55,202 --> 01:15:57,278
Both.

741
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:01,866
Come on, scumbag.

742
01:16:03,168 --> 01:16:05,244
You got nothin'.

743
01:16:20,019 --> 01:16:24,847
- I wanna go to the beach.
- We have to wait, sweetheart.

744
01:16:24,941 --> 01:16:28,357
- I forgot Buttercup.
- Shh, honey. We'll get him.

745
01:16:28,444 --> 01:16:30,271
Can I take her on the beach at least?

746
01:16:30,363 --> 01:16:34,361
- I'm tellin' ya, there ain't gonna be no trial.
- They're gonna cop a plea.

747
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:39,196
- Cop a plea? He killed a fed.
- He didn't know John was a fed. OK?

748
01:16:39,289 --> 01:16:43,073
- He can't chance a trial.
- I don't like this cereal.

749
01:16:43,168 --> 01:16:47,830
- We'll do all we can to keep you off the stand.
- You really think I'm that stupid?

750
01:16:47,923 --> 01:16:50,877
Fellas, am I tellin' it the way it is or what?

751
01:17:09,945 --> 01:17:13,943
- You're a fuckin' maniac, you know that?
- So where they hidin' him?

752
01:17:14,033 --> 01:17:16,239
Atlantic City?

753
01:17:17,078 --> 01:17:19,485
How many times you gonna move us?

754
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:23,115
We can't stay in one place too long.
It's not smart.

755
01:17:48,193 --> 01:17:51,776
Can't you even play with her a little,
goddamn you?

756
01:17:52,906 --> 01:17:54,566
You hangin' on, honey?

757
01:17:54,658 --> 01:17:57,030
Juicy? Hang on.

758
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,028
Hang on. Whoo!

759
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:02,454
There you go. Hang on.

760
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:05,701
Oooh!

761
01:18:07,046 --> 01:18:08,872
Hey, sweetie.

762
01:18:08,964 --> 01:18:12,713
Looky here what I got.
Your wife's final exams.

763
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:18,092
- Think we need to monitor her for cheating?
- She cannot take any damn exams, Calvin.

764
01:18:19,058 --> 01:18:22,474
We're all goin' fuckin' nuts.
I'm losin' my mind.

765
01:18:22,561 --> 01:18:24,850
Ready, honey? Here we go.

766
01:18:28,443 --> 01:18:30,519
Look.

767
01:18:31,738 --> 01:18:34,359
I gotta go into the city tonight.

768
01:18:34,449 --> 01:18:37,200
My youngest daughter, Coral?

769
01:18:37,285 --> 01:18:41,864
Maybe tomorrow when I come back
I can bring her with me. You know.

770
01:18:41,956 --> 01:18:45,207
They're about the same age an' all.
Her and Corinna.

771
01:18:50,507 --> 01:18:53,212
That would be really good of you, man.

772
01:19:01,476 --> 01:19:03,054
Hey. Hey!

773
01:19:03,145 --> 01:19:05,138
Ready? Here we go.

774
01:19:05,981 --> 01:19:08,223
Whoa, a space ride!

775
01:19:10,402 --> 01:19:13,522
My guy was in fear of his life,
and he fired in self-defense.

776
01:19:13,614 --> 01:19:16,650
Dover's gun was holstered
when they pulled him outta the car.

777
01:19:16,742 --> 01:19:22,448
My guy claims that Agent Dover - Omar -
made a move for it without provocation.

778
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:26,538
I can produce witnesses to testify that
Agent Dover had drawn a gun on my client...

779
01:19:26,627 --> 01:19:28,585
...at least three times in the past...

780
01:19:28,671 --> 01:19:34,295
...who can testify that they had seen
Agent Dover taking cocaine, repeatedly...

781
01:19:34,385 --> 01:19:38,430
...and that his behavior in the last few
months was bizarre and paranoid.

782
01:19:38,515 --> 01:19:41,966
Mafia shrinks!
The autopsy came up negative on drugs.

783
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:45,310
- Did you find anything in the car?
- No.

784
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,557
No, huh?

785
01:19:50,777 --> 01:19:54,111
I wanna know if Agent Dover
had assassination clearance.

786
01:19:54,197 --> 01:19:56,819
- Had what?
- All right, let me rephrase.

787
01:19:56,908 --> 01:20:01,736
Had clearance to shoot first if he perceived
that his cover had been blown.

788
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,709
- You goin' fishin' here, Jack?
- Not at all.

789
01:20:05,793 --> 01:20:09,209
I wanna find out if we got
a drug-taking federal agent, strung out...

790
01:20:09,296 --> 01:20:11,372
...with shoot-first clearance.

791
01:20:11,465 --> 01:20:13,790
In all due respect, if that's what we got...

792
01:20:13,884 --> 01:20:16,885
What a bunch of slanderous horseshit!

793
01:20:26,105 --> 01:20:30,648
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a hotel called Tesselers.

794
01:20:30,735 --> 01:20:32,644
I'm sorry. You got me.

795
01:20:32,737 --> 01:20:36,687
- It's near Allenville.
- Allenville? You just drove through it.

796
01:20:36,783 --> 01:20:40,116
- Why don't you backtrack and ask there?
- OK, thank you.

797
01:20:40,787 --> 01:20:43,076
You're welcome.

798
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:50,746
Corinna...

799
01:20:51,965 --> 01:20:54,041
Corinna!

800
01:20:57,554 --> 01:20:59,713
Number three to base. I don't have Corinna.

801
01:20:59,806 --> 01:21:03,507
I want an inventory of all guns,
drugs and cars acquired in New York.

802
01:21:03,602 --> 01:21:06,556
I wanna know how they were
disposed of in Philadelphia.

803
01:21:06,647 --> 01:21:12,353
Was this stuff put back into the community
to establish Dover's street credibility?

804
01:21:12,444 --> 01:21:15,695
I wanna know how many
other agents were involved.

805
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:18,732
Judge, this is an ongoing operation.

806
01:21:18,826 --> 01:21:20,902
We'd jeopardize agents still in the field.

807
01:21:20,995 --> 01:21:22,703
How can I prove self-defense...

808
01:21:22,788 --> 01:21:27,415
...if I can't show the pressures on the guy or
find out if the guy had shoot-first clearance?

809
01:21:27,502 --> 01:21:32,377
OK. Why don't you bring me all the files?
I'll read them in chambers...

810
01:21:32,465 --> 01:21:37,460
...try to sort out what's privileged
and what's appropriate for discovery.

811
01:21:41,808 --> 01:21:45,758
- I can't do that, Judge.
- What d'you mean? I'm ordering you to.

812
01:21:54,279 --> 01:21:58,656
Either you produce the files
or I dismiss the indictment.

813
01:22:04,373 --> 01:22:06,164
Corinna!

814
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:08,741
- Corinna!
- Corinna!

815
01:22:09,086 --> 01:22:10,746
Corinna!

816
01:22:11,547 --> 01:22:13,623
Corinna!

817
01:22:14,341 --> 01:22:16,417
Corinna!

818
01:22:17,178 --> 01:22:19,254
Corinna!!

819
01:22:24,143 --> 01:22:26,219
Co...

820
01:22:38,157 --> 01:22:40,234
Corinna!

821
01:22:42,912 --> 01:22:44,407
Corinna!

822
01:22:44,497 --> 01:22:48,329
I wanna be with my mommy.

823
01:22:52,589 --> 01:22:55,127
What did...? Honey!

824
01:22:58,512 --> 01:23:03,340
You guys really weren't putting guns back
on the street just for credibility, were you?

825
01:23:03,433 --> 01:23:06,933
I mean... that was just
an educated guess on my part.

826
01:23:12,192 --> 01:23:16,605
If you try to indict him on anything else
I'll still wanna know where the goodies went.

827
01:23:16,822 --> 01:23:20,072
And you can tell the state prosecutor
the same thing!

828
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:22,986
You're dropping it?

829
01:23:24,997 --> 01:23:27,749
I don't believe this shit.

830
01:23:27,834 --> 01:23:30,407
Well, hell. All right.

831
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:34,504
- I guess it's up to me.
- You can't be serious.

832
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:39,632
Why? Cos you don't wanna
jeopardize national security? Huh?

833
01:23:39,721 --> 01:23:43,054
Come on! Whose chain
you think you're yankin' here?

834
01:23:43,975 --> 01:23:47,890
If you guys been doin' shit you shouldn't
have been doin', hey, you know...

835
01:23:47,979 --> 01:23:51,064
...that's your problem.
- We're not givin' up any files.

836
01:23:51,149 --> 01:23:54,933
Oh, yeah? Well... we'll see about that.

837
01:23:59,783 --> 01:24:01,859
Come here.

838
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,702
Whaddaya want?

839
01:24:11,795 --> 01:24:13,871
What do I want?

840
01:24:14,548 --> 01:24:17,253
I want a judgeship.

841
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:19,051
Federal.

842
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:32,430
Where they got Kilmartin?
Witness protection?

843
01:24:32,525 --> 01:24:36,854
- No. I hear he's still on the street.
- No shit?

844
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:38,773
Live free or die, huh?

845
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,446
OK. Go to Grandma.

846
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:47,614
I gotcha! I gotcha!

847
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:53,878
I'll talk to you later.

848
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:56,669
- Talk to you later too.
- Call Calvin at least.

849
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,711
Why? It's gonna be OK.

850
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:03,180
Bye-bye.

851
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:06,717
Where you goin', Daddy?

852
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:10,142
- Love you.
- OK.

853
01:26:31,355 --> 01:26:35,899
It's me - Calvin. Come on, gimme the gun.
Turn it loose! Gimme the gun.

854
01:26:42,409 --> 01:26:45,326
Politics? What does that mean?

855
01:26:45,996 --> 01:26:48,700
- What does that mean?
- Jimmy, look...

856
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:51,827
Why... why are you here?

857
01:26:51,918 --> 01:26:54,623
Why are you here?
What'd you come to my house for?

858
01:26:54,713 --> 01:26:57,120
To tell me I got the shaft?

859
01:26:58,258 --> 01:27:00,547
To take my gun away from me?

860
01:27:02,721 --> 01:27:04,381
Hmm. Yeah.

861
01:27:04,473 --> 01:27:08,518
People come to me, say "Jimmy,
we need your help. Please help us." And I do.

862
01:27:08,602 --> 01:27:11,389
But whatever I do, I end up gettin' fucked.

863
01:27:12,439 --> 01:27:15,974
My family... hangin' by a thread.

864
01:27:20,156 --> 01:27:23,322
What's not gonna happen...
that I'm goin' down.

865
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,536
Gimme somethin', Calvin.

866
01:27:31,876 --> 01:27:34,118
Calvin, gimme somethin', please.

867
01:27:36,005 --> 01:27:38,081
Please.

868
01:27:38,466 --> 01:27:40,210
Help me.

869
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:48,050
- You wanna get a dog?
- Yeah.

870
01:27:56,693 --> 01:28:00,442
- Gimme two hot dogs. Mustard? Relish?
- Mustard.

871
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,865
I thought you said you were a man of honor.

872
01:28:14,044 --> 01:28:16,582
Shouldn't you be in witness protection?

873
01:28:16,672 --> 01:28:21,334
What's Junior Brown doin' out on the street?
He killed a federal agent.

874
01:28:21,427 --> 01:28:23,503
Shit happens.

875
01:28:24,138 --> 01:28:26,131
I don't understand.

876
01:28:26,224 --> 01:28:28,679
You had the murder tape, you had me.

877
01:28:32,605 --> 01:28:34,681
Come here.

878
01:28:43,283 --> 01:28:45,026
What tape?

879
01:28:45,118 --> 01:28:47,194
And who the fuck are you?

880
01:28:48,455 --> 01:28:50,364
You know the worst part about this job?

881
01:28:50,457 --> 01:28:54,407
Dealing with one lowlife CI after another.
It's enough to make you sick.

882
01:28:54,503 --> 01:28:59,212
Well, I guess you won't have to bother
with that any more, huh, Judge?

883
01:29:01,134 --> 01:29:03,672
Where'd you hear that?

884
01:29:03,762 --> 01:29:09,717
Let Junior Brown walk, win yourself a federal
judgeship. At least you don't come cheap.

885
01:29:14,607 --> 01:29:16,683
You know...

886
01:29:17,777 --> 01:29:21,691
...the Junior Browns of the world
will always be with us.

887
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:24,733
What's one Junior Brown more or less...

888
01:29:24,825 --> 01:29:28,325
...compared to the work that I can do
as a federal judge?

889
01:29:29,539 --> 01:29:33,868
I'm a good goddamn prosecutor,
but I will make a great judge.

890
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:36,994
Let's see what happens
when I go to the papers.

891
01:29:37,088 --> 01:29:42,379
With what? "Fuck with the bull,
you get the horns"? What is he, a matador?

892
01:29:42,927 --> 01:29:47,340
Besides, the last I heard that tape
got ate by the garbage monster.

893
01:30:03,991 --> 01:30:06,067
Jimmy?

894
01:30:09,204 --> 01:30:11,909
You got a phone call.

895
01:30:13,667 --> 01:30:16,787
<i>- Hello?
- How soon can you get to Baby Cakes?</i>

896
01:30:16,879 --> 01:30:18,670
<i>- What you doin' there?
- How long?</i>

897
01:30:18,756 --> 01:30:20,583
<i>I don't know... 20 minutes.</i>

898
01:30:20,674 --> 01:30:23,960
<i>- 20 minutes. Don't be late.
- Jimmy...</i>

899
01:30:25,846 --> 01:30:27,720
Shit!

900
01:30:43,865 --> 01:30:45,324
Hey!

901
01:30:49,871 --> 01:30:51,947
Hey! Junior.

902
01:30:55,836 --> 01:30:57,378
What's shakin'?

903
01:30:57,462 --> 01:31:01,709
- What are you doin' here?
- I was just gonna ask you the same thing.

904
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,876
You killed a fed.

905
01:31:04,761 --> 01:31:07,965
- How the hell did you walk on that?
- Shit happens.

906
01:31:08,057 --> 01:31:11,141
You blew his brains all over me,
his people know that...

907
01:31:11,226 --> 01:31:14,809
How did they even let you live?
"Shit happens."

908
01:31:14,897 --> 01:31:16,475
"Shit happens." I guess so.

909
01:31:16,565 --> 01:31:20,349
Did you tell the cops
how metal in my mouth makes me gag?

910
01:31:22,238 --> 01:31:24,314
Cos it was a funny thing.

911
01:31:25,283 --> 01:31:27,690
I couldn't get plastic forks in jail.

912
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:32,290
I had to eat everything with my fingers.

913
01:31:34,834 --> 01:31:36,910
What the hell...?

914
01:31:43,802 --> 01:31:46,375
How did you swing it, Junior?

915
01:31:46,471 --> 01:31:48,345
I'm dyin' to know.

916
01:31:48,431 --> 01:31:53,224
Now is not the time, my man,
but I'm gonna see you real soon.

917
01:31:54,729 --> 01:31:56,272
Let's go.

918
01:31:56,356 --> 01:31:58,349
Get back. Easy. Easy...

919
01:32:05,157 --> 01:32:07,233
Get over there.

920
01:32:12,373 --> 01:32:14,531
See me now.

921
01:32:14,625 --> 01:32:18,837
Jimmy, answer me this. Who do I visit first?

922
01:32:19,463 --> 01:32:23,757
You at your house,
or your wife and kid up at Grandma's?

923
01:32:28,055 --> 01:32:31,389
You don't like the taste of metal
in your mouth, huh?

924
01:32:32,435 --> 01:32:34,428
Open up.

925
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,809
Come on, Junior.

926
01:32:36,898 --> 01:32:38,974
Say "ah".

927
01:32:41,402 --> 01:32:43,858
You saw what I did to Omar?

928
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:47,566
Guess who's next.

929
01:32:48,243 --> 01:32:49,903
No!

930
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,536
Don't touch him!

931
01:33:08,806 --> 01:33:11,344
You know this don't end with you, right?

932
01:33:14,687 --> 01:33:20,440
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take your baby girl
for another walk in the woods.

933
01:33:21,736 --> 01:33:23,146
No!

934
01:34:29,722 --> 01:34:31,798
Hold on. Whoa!

935
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:34,426
Now you did it.

936
01:34:38,565 --> 01:34:43,772
Don't you know you can't go around
hittin' the police. Huh?

937
01:34:43,862 --> 01:34:46,234
What's wrong with you?!

938
01:34:49,451 --> 01:34:51,693
Come on. Get up. Get up!

939
01:34:53,163 --> 01:34:54,871
Don't move. Huh?

940
01:35:00,629 --> 01:35:03,085
- What do we got?
- Assaulting an officer.

941
01:35:03,173 --> 01:35:05,249
Nobody can touch me!

942
01:35:05,884 --> 01:35:07,960
Nobody.

943
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:13,216
Jesus, I'm sorry.

944
01:35:17,271 --> 01:35:22,858
You got anything you wanna explain to me,
you suicidal son of a bitch?

945
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:28,069
- Fuck.
- I ain't suicidal.

946
01:35:28,157 --> 01:35:32,570
With this tape, you can drop Junior
down the hole for 30 years.

947
01:35:33,329 --> 01:35:36,698
You still gotta get Zioli to prosecute.

948
01:35:39,544 --> 01:35:41,786
<i> You saw what I did to Omar?</i>

949
01:35:43,631 --> 01:35:45,707
<i>Guess who's next.</i>

950
01:35:46,634 --> 01:35:48,212
So what?

951
01:35:48,303 --> 01:35:50,876
What'd he do to Omar? He didn't specify.

952
01:35:50,972 --> 01:35:52,929
You don't like that tape?

953
01:35:53,016 --> 01:35:55,092
Well...

954
01:36:00,482 --> 01:36:04,350
How about this one?
They would love it on TV.

955
01:36:04,444 --> 01:36:06,484
<i>What's one Junior Brown more or less...</i>

956
01:36:06,572 --> 01:36:10,569
<i>...compared to the work
that I can do as a federal judge?</i>

957
01:36:10,659 --> 01:36:15,784
<i>I'm a good goddamn prosecutor,
but I will make a great judge.</i>

958
01:36:18,209 --> 01:36:20,581
You like that one better?

959
01:36:23,965 --> 01:36:27,630
I reindict Junior, you gotta take the stand,
start all over again.

960
01:36:27,718 --> 01:36:29,925
Nah. I think I'm gonna get lost.

961
01:36:30,012 --> 01:36:34,591
My family's health is in your best interest,
so you better do a good job.

962
01:36:35,268 --> 01:36:39,597
Listen to the part where he says
"You saw what I did to Omar."

963
01:36:40,231 --> 01:36:42,307
Listen to that again.

964
01:36:44,277 --> 01:36:48,061
- It's probably better than you think.
- Kilmartin, wait. Jimmy!

965
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,279
Don't do this to me!

966
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:00,825
Daddy, come on, let's go!
