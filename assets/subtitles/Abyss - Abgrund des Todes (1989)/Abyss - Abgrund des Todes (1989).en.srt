1
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,991
60 knots? No way, Barnes.

2
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,514
The Reds don't have anything that fast.

3
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,036
Checked it twice. I mean,
it's a real unique signature.

4
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,793
No cavitation. No reactor noise.

5
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,030
It doesn't even sound like screws.

6
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,791
What the hell is it?

7
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,553
I'll tell you what it's not.
It's not one of ours.

8
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,835
Sir, contact changing to heading

9
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,911
214.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,991
Speed,

11
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,150
80 knots.

12
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,956
80 knots.

13
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,190
Still diving. Depth 900 feet.

14
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,910
Still diving. Depth 900 feet.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,037
Port clearance 150 feet from the cliff wall, sir.

16
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,509
It's getting tight in here.

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,955
We can still give him a haircut.

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,918
Helm, come right to... 069.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,991
Down five degrees.

20
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,389
Coming right 069. Down five degrees. Aye.

21
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,233
Port side clearance 120 feet. Narrowing 75.

22
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,754
Sir, we have a proximity warning light.

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,229
It's too damn close! We gotta back off.

24
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,356
Sir, range to contact 200.

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,035
Contact justjinked to bearing 260
and accelerated to...

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,391
to 130 knots, sir.

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,948
Nothin' goes 130.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,833
Sir, range to contact 100 yards.

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,911
80 yards, sir!

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,831
60!

31
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,510
It's turbulence! We're in its wake!

32
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,750
Helm, all stop! Full right rudder.

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,037
Hydraulic failure. Planes not responding, sir.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,998
Auxiliary power. Monitors back.

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,719
Hydraulics restored, sir.

36
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,913
Oh, my God!

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,428
Fire in sonar!

38
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,954
Collision alarm!

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,797
Fire control to sonar!

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,869
Let's get outta here!

41
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,475
- Lighten her up, Charlie!
- Port torpedo room is flooded, sir!

42
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,439
Blow all tanks!
Blow all the tanks! Blow everything!

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,111
All back full!

44
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,077
Answering, all back full!

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,628
Give me a damage report! What's our depth?

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,275
Passing 1400, sir.

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,430
Main forward tanks are ruptured!

48
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,317
Still descending, sir!

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,789
1450.

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,870
Passing 1500, sir.

51
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,349
Still descending.

52
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,115
- We're too deep to pump auxiliaries.
- Passing 1550. Still descending.

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,431
- We're losin' her!
- Passing 1600, sir,

54
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,159
- and still descending!
- Launch the buoy.

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,071
Passing 1650.

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,116
- Passing 1700, sir.
- Launching!

57
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,391
Come on! Give me your hand!

58
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,477
Get the door closed!

59
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:11,758
Benthic Explorer, Salvor One on final. Over.

60
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:14,477
Copy you, Salvor One.
This is Benthic Explorer.

61
00:05:14,558 --> 00:05:16,549
You're cleared to land.

62
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:19,106
Hey! They're coming.

63
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,108
This... could get pretty ugly.

64
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:30,551
Yeah.

65
00:05:30,638 --> 00:05:32,629
Does not look good at all.

66
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,911
Oh, no. Look who's with them.

67
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:10,351
The queen bitch of the universe.

68
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:14,076
Sonny, how you doin'?

69
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:16,830
I've got two more welds on this bypass valve.

70
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,908
No light from the surface.

71
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:21,192
- How deep are they?
- McBride?

72
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:23,268
1700 feet.

73
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:27,066
- I need them to go below 2,000.
- No problem. They can do that.

74
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:33,474
So that's it? You just cheerfully turn
the whole thing over to the goon squad?

75
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:36,549
Look, I was told to cooperate.
I'm cooperating.

76
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:39,747
Kirkhill, you're pathetic.

77
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:41,828
Get Brigman on the line.

78
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,908
Deepcore, this is Benthic.

79
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:45,988
Man, if Bud goes along with this,

80
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:49,353
they're gonna have to shoot her
with a tranquilliser gun.

81
00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:50,916
- Roger.
- Hippy, get me Bud.

82
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:03,195
Catfish, get them old bones up here
and give me a hand.

83
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:05,507
Hang on. I'll be up there in a second.

84
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,947
Hey, you guys are milkin' that job.

85
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:17,792
Yeah, it's just because we love freezing
our butts off out here for you so much.

86
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:19,868
Bring me another hammer!

87
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:26,145
- Hey, Bud!
- Yeah!

88
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:28,225
Hippy's on the bitch box!

89
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,226
It's a call from topside.
That new company man.

90
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:32,793
- Kirkhill?
- Yeah.

91
00:07:32,874 --> 00:07:35,911
That guy don't know his butt from a rathole.

92
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:39,873
Perry, square away this mud hose
and get rid of some of these empty sacks.

93
00:07:39,954 --> 00:07:43,663
- It's starting to look like my apartment.
- You got it, boss!

94
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:49,305
- Bud, pick up the topside line. Urgent.
- I'm coming!

95
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:52,227
I'm coming! Jesus! Keep your pantyhose on!

96
00:07:58,953 --> 00:08:01,308
Brigman here.

97
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,782
Yeah, Kirkhill. What's goin' on?

98
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:05,864
Yeah, I'm calm.

99
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:09,832
I'm a calm person. Is there some reason
why I shouldn't be calm?

100
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:15,586
What?

101
00:08:19,353 --> 00:08:21,344
I am on last feed now.

102
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:29,425
Can you get that goddamn hippy shit music
off the comm line, please?

103
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:37,587
I'm almost done with the shut-off valve.

104
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:40,870
Sonny, I'm right behind you
with the next fitting.

105
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,944
Hang on a second.

106
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:46,464
- OK, give it to me.
- Here you go.

107
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:48,145
Thanks, sweetie.

108
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:56,701
All divers, drop what you're doin'.
Everybody out of the pool.

109
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:01,542
I mean everybody right now.
Sonny, One Night, let's go.

110
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:04,272
Damn it. We just got out here.

111
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:06,992
There was a time when I woulda asked why.

112
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,951
- Get a move on!
- Shit, woman!

113
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:22,547
Deepcore, Deepcore.
This is Flatbed preparing to surface.

114
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,624
Roger, Flatbed. Come on up.

115
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:28,910
All rig personnel assemble at the moon pool.

116
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:31,712
Everybody get to sub-bay. ASAP.

117
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:37,624
Come on. Let's get his hat off.

118
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:40,663
- Take it off.
- What the hell's goin' on?

119
00:09:40,753 --> 00:09:43,586
- How come we got recalled?
- The hell if I know.

120
00:09:43,673 --> 00:09:45,664
I got it.

121
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:49,746
- What's the drift, pardner? Why are we up?
- Just follow standard procedure.

122
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,552
Flog your dog till somebody
tells you what's happenin'.

123
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,828
- What's the story, boss?
- Folks, listen up!

124
00:09:56,353 --> 00:09:59,948
We just been told to shut down the hole
and prepare to move the rig.

125
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,024
- Oh, shit!
- What?

126
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:07,107
We've received an invitation to, um,
cooperate in a matter of national security.

127
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:09,184
Now you know as much as I do.

128
00:10:09,273 --> 00:10:12,822
Get your gear off and get to control.
We've got a briefing in ten minutes.

129
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:13,743
Come on! Let's move it!

130
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:18,423
At 0922 local time today
an American nuclear submarine,

131
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:21,471
the USS Montana,
with 156 men aboard, went down

132
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:24,585
- about 22 miles from here.
- Damn!

133
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:29,301
There's been no contact with the sub since
then. The cause of the incident is not known.

134
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:32,861
Your company has authorised
the navy's use of this facility

135
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:36,944
for a rescue operation
code-named Operation Salvor.

136
00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:40,421
- You want us to search for the sub?
- No. We know where it is.

137
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,548
But she's in 2,000 feet of water
and we can't reach her.

138
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:47,146
We need divers to enter the sub
and search for survivors... if any.

139
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:49,381
Don't you have your own stuff for this?

140
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,702
By the time we get our submersibles here,
the storm'll be on us.

141
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,784
You can get your rig in and be on site
in 15 hours. That makes you our best option.

142
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:59,988
Why should we risk our butts
for something like this?

143
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:03,507
I have been authorised
to offer you all special bonuses

144
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:06,185
equivalent to three times normal dive pay.

145
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:08,102
Yes, sir, buddy!

146
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:10,182
For triple time, I'd eat Beany!

147
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:12,831
Set me on fire
and put me out with horse piss.

148
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:15,823
I don't know what kind of deal
you made with the company,

149
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:19,381
but my people are not qualified for this.
We're oil workers.

150
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,065
Shut up! Hold it down.

151
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:24,142
This is Lieutenant Coffey.

152
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:27,985
He will transfer down to you with
a SEAL team and supervise the operation.

153
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:31,143
Send down whoever you like,
but I'm the tool pusher on this rig.

154
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:34,621
When it comes to the safety of these people,
there's me and then God.

155
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:37,020
Understand? If things get dicey,

156
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,102
I'm pulling the plug.

157
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:43,428
I think we're all
on the same wavelength, Brigman.

158
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:46,662
Now, let's get the wellhead uncoupled,
shall we?

159
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,706
Let's take it about five degrees left, all right?

160
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:23,343
Roger. Five degrees left, Bud.

161
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:34,503
Plot these numbers to our position.
I need to know when the leading edge will hit.

162
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:37,820
Well, it's official.
They're calling it Hurricane Frederick.

163
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:40,218
And it's gonna be making our lives

164
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:43,540
- real interesting in a few hours.
- Fred?

165
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,338
I don't know, man. I think hurricanes
should be named after women, don't you?

166
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:58,226
- I can't believe you're letting them do this.
- Hi, Lins!

167
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:00,948
I thought you were in Houston.

168
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:03,460
I was. Now I'm here.

169
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,258
- Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
- Wasn't up to me.

170
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:11,342
We were that close to proving
a submersible drilling platform could work.

171
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:14,626
- I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
- Your rig?

172
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:17,746
- I designed the damn thing.
- Benthic Petroleum paid for it.

173
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:21,265
So as long as they're holding the pink slip,
I go where they tell me.

174
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:26,104
I had a lot riding on this. They bought you,
didn't they? More like rented you cheap!

175
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,180
I'm switchin' off now.

176
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:29,384
Bye-bye.

177
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:33,144
Oh, OK. Virgil, you wiener!
You never could stand up to a fight!

178
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,220
Bye-bye.

179
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:37,300
Virgil?

180
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,940
God, I hate that bitch!

181
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:45,586
Probably shouldn't have married her,
then, huh?

182
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,820
Get it stable!

183
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,139
Cab 3. You're clear to launch.

184
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:02,341
Hang on, gentlemen.

185
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:09,179
Touchdown! Crowd goes wild!

186
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:15,062
Explorer, this is Cab 3. We are styling.

187
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:18,141
- How you boys doin' back there?
- Great.

188
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:25,019
Explorer, this is Cab 3.
Starting our descent along the umbilical.

189
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:29,181
- Roger that, Cab 3. Good luck.
- Luck is not a factor.

190
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:41,786
- Hey, One Night. How you doin'?
- I got a white line fever, baby.

191
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:43,460
Yeah, I heard that.

192
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:01,379
Deepcore, Deepcore.

193
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:06,667
- This is Cab 3 on final approach.
- Roger, Cab 3. Is that you, Lindsey?

194
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:09,137
None other.

195
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:13,063
Oh, no!

196
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:33,867
Howdy, boys!

197
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:35,939
Hey, Lindsey!

198
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,019
I'll be damned!

199
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:41,578
Y'all shouldn't be down here, sweet thing.
You might ruin your stockings.

200
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:49,576
The bad news is we got eight hours
in this can blowin' down.

201
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:53,104
And the worse news is
it's gonna take us three weeks

202
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:56,544
- to decompress later.
- We've all been fully briefed, Mrs Brigman.

203
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:58,983
Just don't call me that, OK? I hate that.

204
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:04,300
All right. What would you like us to call you?

205
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:06,538
Sir?

206
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:11,179
There we go!

207
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:13,577
Y'all start equalisin'... now!

208
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,507
Let's watch each other closely
for signs of HPNS.

209
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:24,581
High pressure nervous syndrome.
Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.

210
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,057
- Nausea, excitability...
- Disorientation.

211
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:29,423
And a partridge in a pear tree.

212
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:35,586
About one person in 20 can't handle it.
They just go buggo.

213
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:38,136
Look, they've all made runs to this depth.

214
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:40,458
- They checked out.
- I understand that.

215
00:17:40,548 --> 00:17:43,108
What I'm saying is it's impossible to predict

216
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,180
- just who's susceptible.
- They checked out.

217
00:17:48,588 --> 00:17:50,579
- These guys the SEALs?
- Yeah.

218
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:54,627
Those guys ain't so tough.
I've fought guys plenty tougher than them.

219
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:58,223
Now we get to hear
how you could have been a contender?

220
00:17:58,308 --> 00:17:59,741
Hey!

221
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,944
- You see this?
- Yeah.

222
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:03,984
They used to call this the hammer.

223
00:18:12,988 --> 00:18:15,786
Y'all done to a turn and ready to serve.

224
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:17,859
Everybody OK?

225
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,943
- They're really very sweet.
- Yeah.

226
00:18:24,028 --> 00:18:27,623
Hey! I don't remember putting a wall here.
How you doin', Jammer?

227
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,347
- Pretty good. How are you, little lady?
- I'm OK.

228
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:39,619
I want a full check on their gear.

229
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:43,223
These guys are about as much fun
as a tax audit.

230
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:01,499
Hippy, you're gonna give that rat a disease.

231
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,577
Hi, Lins!

232
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,137
Well, well. Mrs Brigman.

233
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:10,217
Not for long.

234
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:16,059
You never did like being called that, did you?

235
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:19,416
Not even when it meant something.

236
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:24,855
- Is that One Night in Flatbed?
- Yeah. Who else? Here. Say hi.

237
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:29,542
- Hey, One Night. It's Lindsey.
- Oh, hi, Lindsey.

238
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:41,540
Obstacle-avoidance is showin'a rise
out about 100m. What do you wanna do?

239
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:45,422
I can't believe
you were dumb enough to come down here.

240
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:47,735
Now you're stuck here for the storm.

241
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:52,376
- That was dumb, hot rod. Real dumb.
- I didn't come down here to fight with you.

242
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:56,736
Yeah, well...

243
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:58,816
Then why did you come down?

244
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:02,534
You need me. Nobody knows
the systems on this rig better than I do.

245
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:06,857
Once you're disconnected, you guys are on
your own for however long this storm lasts.

246
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:10,574
What if something was to happen
after the surface support clears off?

247
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:14,817
Wow, you're right. Us poor dumb old boys
might've had to think for ourselves.

248
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:16,896
It could've been a disaster.

249
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:22,178
- You wanna know what I think?
- Jesus! Look where this thing is set.

250
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:25,223
- You wanna know what I think?
- Not particularly.

251
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:28,615
- I think you were worried about me.
- Then that must be it.

252
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:31,742
No, seriously. I think you were.
Come on. It's OK.

253
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,816
It's OK. You can admit it.

254
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:35,941
I was worried... about the rig.

255
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:38,744
I've got over four years
invested in this project.

256
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:41,658
Yeah. You only had three years
invested in me.

257
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:45,375
Well, you have to have priorities.

258
00:20:58,905 --> 00:21:03,774
It's kinda messy, but I guarantee you
it's the only bunk that won't be occupied.

259
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:06,982
You can get a couple of hours' rest
before we get there.

260
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,295
What are you still wearing that for?

261
00:21:10,785 --> 00:21:12,776
I don't know.

262
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:15,536
Divorce ain't final.

263
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:18,936
Forgot to take it off.

264
00:21:20,705 --> 00:21:22,775
I haven't worn mine in months.

265
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,856
Yeah.

266
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:27,937
Well, whatshisname wouldn't like it.
The suit.

267
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:32,495
Do you always have to call him that?

268
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:35,179
The suit. Makes you sound like such a hick.

269
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:37,256
His name is Michael.

270
00:21:37,345 --> 00:21:40,496
How is Michael, then? Mr Brooks Brothers.

271
00:21:40,585 --> 00:21:42,462
Mr BMW.

272
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:44,536
You still seeing him?

273
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,422
No.

274
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:51,614
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

275
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:54,503
Terribly sorry. What happened?

276
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:59,224
Why are you doing this?
This is none of your business!

277
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:01,535
It's not a part of your life any more.

278
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:05,215
I'll tell you what happened.

279
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:08,342
You woke up one morning
in those satin sheets,

280
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:11,701
rolled over,
and there was this good-looking guy.

281
00:22:11,785 --> 00:22:13,901
Well-groomed, expensive watch on.

282
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:17,022
And you realised
"This guy never makes me laugh."

283
00:22:17,105 --> 00:22:20,700
That's it, Bud. That's it!
Aren't you clever? Jesus! You're clever!

284
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:23,618
You should start your own talk show!
Ask Dr Bud.

285
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:26,583
Advice to the lovelorn from 300 fathoms.

286
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:28,223
Thank you. Thank you.

287
00:23:01,503 --> 00:23:03,494
Oh, shit!

288
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:09,299
- Cuttin'you loose, Bud.
- OK, One Night. Stay clear.

289
00:23:09,383 --> 00:23:11,374
We're setting her down.

290
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:17,374
Touchdown!

291
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,860
This is us, sitting right on the edge
of the Cayman Trough.

292
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:27,617
This is the Montana.
300m away, 70m below us.

293
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:31,979
We think she slid down the wall
and now sits here on this outcropping.

294
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:36,257
So we're gonna have to drop
straight down... here and...

295
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:39,253
This tell us how much radiation we're gettin'?

296
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:42,378
Whoa! I'm not going near
no radiation! No way!

297
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:45,100
- Hippy, you pussy.
- What good is the money,

298
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:47,536
six months later your dick drops off?

299
00:23:47,621 --> 00:23:50,613
We'll take readings as we go.
If the reactor's breached,

300
00:23:50,701 --> 00:23:54,774
the warheads have released
any radioactive debris, we'll just back off.

301
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:56,852
- It's that simple.
- OK.

302
00:23:56,941 --> 00:24:00,536
OK. Hippy's not going,
so, McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.

303
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:04,216
Goddamn it! You know
McWhirter can't run an ROV worth shit!

304
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:06,257
Then you'd better go.

305
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:08,332
I'll go.

306
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:11,254
What is your problem? On this dive

307
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:14,731
you'll do absolutely nothing
without direct orders from me.

308
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:19,019
And you'll follow those orders
without discussion. Is that clear?

309
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:23,334
I want everyone
ready to get wet in 15 minutes.

310
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:29,096
- Gimme a hand loading Little Geek.
- Let's get suited up.

311
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:31,251
Hey, guys! Hold it a second.

312
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,973
Hold it!

313
00:24:34,061 --> 00:24:36,052
Whoa!

314
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:40,772
Look...

315
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:45,218
...it's 3am. These guys are running on
bad coffee and about four hours of sleep.

316
00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:47,531
Maybe you could cut them some slack.

317
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:51,739
- I can't afford slack.
- You come on my rig, you don't talk to me,

318
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:55,177
and you start ordering my people around.
It's not gonna work.

319
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:59,618
You gotta know how to handle these people.
We got a certain way of doing things here.

320
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:04,616
I'm not interested in your way of doing
things. Just get your team ready to dive.

321
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:12,370
These guys have got no sense of humour.

322
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:18,531
Bud, do you know your hand is blue?

323
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:21,340
Finler, why don't you just shut up
and put your gear on?

324
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:23,938
Keep it coming.

325
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:27,974
Hippy, throw me
one of them cyalumes, please.

326
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:30,939
- Good.
- Excuse me.

327
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:35,139
- What is all this stuff?
- Fluid breathing system. We just got them.

328
00:25:35,221 --> 00:25:38,497
- You use it when you go really deep.
- How deep?

329
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:40,572
- Deep.
- How deep?

330
00:25:40,661 --> 00:25:41,332
It's classified.

331
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:44,895
You breathe liquid
so you can't get compressed.

332
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:48,610
- The pressure doesn't get you.
- You mean you got liquid in your lungs?

333
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:50,692
Oxygenated, fluorocarbon

334
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:52,772
- emulsion.
- Bullshit!

335
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:56,252
Check this out.

336
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,551
- Can I borrow your rat?
- What are you doin'?

337
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:02,115
- It's gonna be fine.
- No, man. She's gonna drown!

338
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,917
He's gonna be fine.
I've breathed this myself.

339
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,016
Getting plenty of oxygen.

340
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:10,330
Damn rat's breathing that shit.

341
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:12,937
He's taking the fluid into his lungs.

342
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:16,851
She's doin' it. She ain't diggin' it.
All right, let her out now!

343
00:26:18,061 --> 00:26:20,714
OK. Now we let the fluid drain from his lungs.

344
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:23,810
All right. Give her here. Give her here.

345
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:25,476
Here's your rat.

346
00:26:27,261 --> 00:26:29,016
- See? He's fine!
- It's a she.

347
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,877
Going over the wall.

348
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,951
Coming to bearing 065.

349
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,471
Flatbed, you on line?

350
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,155
Ten-four, Lindsey.
We read you loud and clear.

351
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,513
Starting our descent. Divers, how you doin'?

352
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,556
Everybody's OK so far.

353
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,950
Hang on, boys. It's all downhill from here.

354
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,636
- Hey, how deep's the drop-off here?
- This here's the bottomless pit, baby.

355
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,757
Two and a half miles straight down.

356
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,271
Cab 3, it's Bud. You on line?

357
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,316
Cab 3 check.

358
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,391
I'm right behind you.

359
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,157
Cab 1, do you see it yet?

360
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,994
Magnetometer's twitching,
but I don't see anything yet.

361
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,230
Hang on. I'm gonna test my strobes.

362
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,151
Cab 1, do you have a visual?

363
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,794
- Cab 1, do you copy?
- Yeah.

364
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,871
Roger that. Found it.

365
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,589
Cab 1, radiation readings?

366
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,194
Neutron counter's not showing much.

367
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,909
All right.
Just continue forward along the hull.

368
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,198
Copy that. Continuing forward.
You want me to get shots of everything, yes?

369
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,635
Roger that. Document as much as you can.

370
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,429
But, please, keep moving.
Remember, we're on a tight time line.

371
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,511
Copy that.

372
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,909
Coming up to the midships hatch.
Do you see it, Cab 3?

373
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,433
Yeah, roger. I got it.

374
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,519
- How do you want me?
- Just hold above it.

375
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,637
- Roger. Holding.
- OK. It's all yours, Lieutenant.

376
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,837
- All right, A Team.
- Let's do it.

377
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,515
OK. Perry, Hippy.

378
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,910
- Let's get that ROVlaunched.
- OK. We're on it, boss.

379
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,399
Go!

380
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,990
Little Geek is on the case.

381
00:29:10,077 --> 00:29:13,626
Monk here, sir.
We got the midships outer hatch open.

382
00:29:15,317 --> 00:29:17,308
Entering escape trunk.

383
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:22,028
Inner hatch looks intact.

384
00:29:27,477 --> 00:29:30,389
It's flooded. All right. I'm gonna open her up.

385
00:29:39,637 --> 00:29:41,593
OK. Get in there.

386
00:29:43,077 --> 00:29:46,956
- Roger. Somebody get on that tether.
- Got it.

387
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:51,747
Sorry about this, little buddy, but better
you than me. You know what I mean?

388
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:02,674
Coffey, these are the missile hatches, right?

389
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:06,386
That's right. It looks like
a couple of the hatches have sprung.

390
00:30:06,477 --> 00:30:09,594
Radiation's nominal.
Warheads must still be intact.

391
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:11,668
How many are there?

392
00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:14,430
24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile.

393
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:17,468
That's 192 warheads, Coffey.

394
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,508
How powerful are they?

395
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:24,670
Your MIRVis a tactical nuke.
50 kilotons nominal yield.

396
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:26,793
Say... five times Hiroshima.

397
00:30:29,357 --> 00:30:31,348
Jesus Christ!

398
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,188
It's World War III in a can.

399
00:30:34,277 --> 00:30:36,632
Let's knock off the chatter.

400
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,749
OK. I'm headin' into the reactor compartment.

401
00:30:40,837 --> 00:30:43,226
- Getting a reading?
- It's twitching.

402
00:30:43,317 --> 00:30:45,831
But it's below the line you said was safe.

403
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:49,346
All right. Let's get in there.

404
00:30:57,197 --> 00:31:01,270
Flatbed, drop down starboard
of the sail and stay along the cliff edge.

405
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:03,348
OK. Copy that.

406
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:11,587
Keep heading for the bow.

407
00:31:19,957 --> 00:31:21,948
OK, Flatbed. This looks good.

408
00:31:22,677 --> 00:31:24,315
Just set it down here.

409
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,549
- We're solid.
- Let's go.

410
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,991
All right. Let's go.

411
00:31:43,077 --> 00:31:46,194
OK. Let's just take it slow and easy goin'in.

412
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,188
Don't take any chances.

413
00:32:14,397 --> 00:32:16,388
Where are we, Coffey?

414
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:19,753
This is the forward berthing compartment.
This way.

415
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:39,149
- You guys OK? Cat? Jammer?
- Right behind you, Bud.

416
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:41,228
Check your gauges.

417
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:44,388
How's your O2?

418
00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:47,753
- I'm OK.
- Yeah, gauges are good.

419
00:32:47,837 --> 00:32:49,395
OK.

420
00:32:49,477 --> 00:32:51,468
16 minutes to go.

421
00:33:00,557 --> 00:33:02,548
Jammer here. CO2 is up.

422
00:33:03,437 --> 00:33:05,428
- Breathe slower, buddy.
- OK.

423
00:33:12,197 --> 00:33:14,188
Come on. Let's keep up.

424
00:33:16,517 --> 00:33:19,270
All right. Up this way to the control centre.

425
00:33:44,797 --> 00:33:46,788
It's jammed! Gimme a hand!

426
00:33:46,877 --> 00:33:49,027
Get up here with that pry bar.

427
00:33:50,957 --> 00:33:53,027
It's moving. Pull!

428
00:34:01,717 --> 00:34:02,866
Jesus!

429
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,517
All right! We knew we were gonna see this.

430
00:34:05,597 --> 00:34:07,588
Just move on.

431
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:13,311
- Jesus!
- Come on, Jammer. Let's go.

432
00:34:47,077 --> 00:34:49,432
OK. Let's stay cool.

433
00:34:49,517 --> 00:34:51,633
Everybody stay cool.

434
00:34:53,277 --> 00:34:57,236
We can't help these guys,
but we might find somebody further in.

435
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,429
Stay here.

436
00:35:19,957 --> 00:35:23,188
Hey, Jammer. You OK?

437
00:35:23,277 --> 00:35:26,075
- How you guys doin'?
- I'm dealin'.

438
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:29,354
Triple time sounded like
a lot of money, Bud. It ain't.

439
00:35:29,437 --> 00:35:31,348
We're here. Let's get it done, OK?

440
00:35:32,117 --> 00:35:35,268
Brigman, take your men and continue aft.

441
00:35:35,357 --> 00:35:38,190
Split up into two teams.

442
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:41,269
Come on. Let's get moving.
We head back in 14 minutes.

443
00:35:41,357 --> 00:35:42,756
Let's go.

444
00:35:50,637 --> 00:35:52,628
You OK, Jammer?

445
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,708
Yeah, I'm fine.

446
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:03,305
- What's this?
- Should be the missile launch control centre.

447
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:05,865
- Don't touch anything.
- No.

448
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:08,312
This way.

449
00:36:08,397 --> 00:36:10,547
I'm right behind you.

450
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:32,906
- Still with me, Jammer?
- Where are we?

451
00:36:32,997 --> 00:36:36,467
Missile compartment.
Those are the launch tubes.

452
00:36:43,717 --> 00:36:45,309
Shit!

453
00:36:48,357 --> 00:36:50,348
Hey, Jammer.

454
00:36:51,517 --> 00:36:52,506
Hey!

455
00:36:52,597 --> 00:36:54,952
Hey! You OK?

456
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:57,028
Deep and slow, big guy.

457
00:36:57,117 --> 00:37:00,632
- Deep and slow. Just breathe easy.
- Everybody's dead!

458
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:04,392
- They're all dead!
- OK. I'm taking you back out. Let's go.

459
00:37:04,477 --> 00:37:06,468
I'm OK.

460
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:11,868
I just can't go any further in.

461
00:37:11,957 --> 00:37:14,835
OK, Jammer. No problem.
You stay right here.

462
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:17,829
I've gotta check out this compartment,
all right?

463
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:21,956
We'll stay in voice contact.
You hold onto the end of this rope here.

464
00:37:22,037 --> 00:37:25,029
You have any problem whatsoever,
you tug twice.

465
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,677
- I got it.
- Pull it hard. Five more minutes.

466
00:37:27,757 --> 00:37:29,907
Just relax, all right? You'll be OK.

467
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,555
- It's OK.
- Be right back.

468
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:17,468
You still readin'me OK, big guy?

469
00:38:18,277 --> 00:38:20,632
Read you fine, Bud.

470
00:38:25,357 --> 00:38:28,429
OK. Just a few more minutes.

471
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:31,953
There's a couple of compartments up ahead
that might have air.

472
00:38:32,037 --> 00:38:35,234
- OK. No problem.
- We gotta be sure, right?

473
00:38:35,317 --> 00:38:37,751
Hang on, Jammer. Just hold onto that...

474
00:38:44,317 --> 00:38:46,592
Shit!

475
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:48,668
Bud? Can you hear me?

476
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,548
Bud?

477
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:55,786
Goddamn it!

478
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:09,591
Oh, Jesus!

479
00:39:38,437 --> 00:39:39,836
Bud, is that you?

480
00:40:02,237 --> 00:40:04,228
Hang on, Jammer.

481
00:40:06,597 --> 00:40:08,872
Lew! Cat! Hurry up, on the double!

482
00:40:10,037 --> 00:40:12,028
I'm on my way!

483
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,794
Jammer!

484
00:40:22,717 --> 00:40:25,231
- What's the problem?
- He's convulsing!

485
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,707
It's his mixture! Too much oxygen!

486
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:33,353
Gotta get the O2 cut down! Turn him over!

487
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:37,066
Crank it down, man! You're losing him!

488
00:40:39,717 --> 00:40:43,835
All right. We've gotta get him outta here!
Let's go. Let's move it.

489
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:45,908
Easy, big fella.

490
00:40:45,997 --> 00:40:47,066
That's it.

491
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:51,187
One Night, do you see the divers?

492
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:53,666
- Are they out yet?
- Negative, Lindsey.

493
00:40:53,757 --> 00:40:57,033
Haven't seen hide nor hair.
Let's give 'em two minutes more max

494
00:40:57,117 --> 00:40:59,233
and then I'll sound the diver recall...

495
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,868
Lindsey, do you copy?

496
00:41:20,957 --> 00:41:23,869
Meet me at Flatbed!
This is a diver emergency!

497
00:41:23,957 --> 00:41:27,393
- Lins, do you copy!
- Yeah, copy you, Bud. I'm on my way.

498
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:35,268
Look, I'm just a medic.

499
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:40,155
Which is mostly about patching holes.
This type of thing, it's...

500
00:41:40,237 --> 00:41:42,228
There's not much I can do.

501
00:41:42,997 --> 00:41:45,067
The coma could last hours or days.

502
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:54,830
So you didn't get anything on the cameras?

503
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:57,067
No, I didn't get a picture of it.

504
00:41:57,157 --> 00:41:59,432
- What about the video?
- No.

505
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,508
We lost power right then.

506
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:04,236
Look, I just don't wanna talk about this, OK?

507
00:42:04,317 --> 00:42:06,308
Fine. Be that way.

508
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:08,706
Look, I don't know what I saw, Bud, OK?

509
00:42:08,797 --> 00:42:11,834
Coffey wants to call it
a Russian submersible-fine.

510
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:14,750
It's a Russian submersible. No problem.

511
00:42:14,837 --> 00:42:17,590
Yeah, but you think it was something else.

512
00:42:17,677 --> 00:42:19,907
What?

513
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:21,988
One of ours?

514
00:42:24,397 --> 00:42:25,989
No.

515
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:28,068
Well, whose then?

516
00:42:29,317 --> 00:42:31,308
Come on, Lindsey. Talk to me.

517
00:42:32,477 --> 00:42:34,752
Look, Jammer saw something down there.

518
00:42:34,837 --> 00:42:38,512
- Something that scared the hell out of him.
- His mixture got screwed up.

519
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:42,351
Jammer panicked. He pranged his regulator
and his mixture got screwed up.

520
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:44,792
But what did he see that made him panic?

521
00:42:46,637 --> 00:42:48,628
Well, what do you think he saw?

522
00:42:50,357 --> 00:42:52,666
I don't know.

523
00:42:52,757 --> 00:42:56,591
- Did any of you see it?
- No, sir. The Brigman woman saw it.

524
00:42:57,597 --> 00:42:59,986
Could have been a Russian bogey.

525
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,147
CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit.

526
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:07,348
Two Russian attack subs, a Tango and a
Victor, were tracked to within 50 miles of here.

527
00:43:07,437 --> 00:43:10,747
And now they don't know
where the hell they are. OK.

528
00:43:12,277 --> 00:43:16,111
I don't have any choice.
I'm confirming you to go to Phase Two.

529
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:20,827
You'll recover one warhead, arm it,
and wait for further instructions.

530
00:43:21,837 --> 00:43:24,590
- Have we got a problem with that?
- Negative, sir.

531
00:43:26,556 --> 00:43:28,035
Come on!

532
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:30,186
- What'd he say?
- Turn it up, bozo!

533
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:35,714
...early reports that the Montana encountered
a Soviet fast attack sub prior to its sinking

534
00:43:35,796 --> 00:43:38,754
and the Kremlin
continues to deny any involvement.

535
00:43:38,836 --> 00:43:40,827
That's us! That's us, man!

536
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:44,625
Benthic Petroleum are participating
in the recovery operation,

537
00:43:44,716 --> 00:43:46,786
but we have little information.

538
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:49,265
We want names!

539
00:43:49,356 --> 00:43:52,792
Hey, that's the Explorer! We're famous!

540
00:43:52,876 --> 00:43:55,470
There is a tremendous amount of activity.

541
00:43:55,556 --> 00:44:00,107
With Cuba only 80 miles away,
the massive build-up of American forces

542
00:44:00,196 --> 00:44:03,393
has drawn official protest
from Havana and Moscow.

543
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:07,833
Russian and Cuban trawlers,
undoubtedly surveillance vessels,

544
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:10,066
have been circling the area

545
00:44:10,156 --> 00:44:12,750
- and Soviet aircraft have been warned away.
- This sucks!

546
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:17,755
- Hippy, what's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me? Nothing!

547
00:44:17,836 --> 00:44:20,748
We're in the middle
of some international incident

548
00:44:20,836 --> 00:44:24,624
- like the Cuban Missile Crisis!
- Figured that out for yourself, Hip?

549
00:44:24,716 --> 00:44:26,832
We got Russian subs creeping around.

550
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:30,545
Anything goes wrong,
they could say whatever they want happened.

551
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:33,230
Relax, will you?
You're making the women nervous.

552
00:44:33,316 --> 00:44:35,546
- Cute, Virgil.
- You know,

553
00:44:35,636 --> 00:44:38,992
those SEALs ain't tellin' us diddly.
Something is goin' on!

554
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:42,591
- Come on, come on.
- Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.

555
00:44:42,676 --> 00:44:44,667
Everything is.

556
00:44:44,756 --> 00:44:46,826
Coffey's splitting with Flatbed!

557
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:50,067
I showed him how to work the controls
and they're outta here!

558
00:44:50,156 --> 00:44:52,192
- Didn't you tell him we need it?
- Yeah!

559
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:54,790
- Where the hell is he takin' it?
- I have no idea!

560
00:44:54,876 --> 00:44:56,548
Shit!

561
00:44:58,554 --> 00:45:00,192
Coffey! Come back! We need

562
00:45:00,274 --> 00:45:02,663
the big arm to unhook the umbilical.

563
00:45:02,754 --> 00:45:05,063
There's a goddamn hurricane coming!

564
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:08,268
- He switched off.
- It's unbelievable.

565
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:14,311
Go back down and tell those men
to get below and stay there!

566
00:45:24,634 --> 00:45:27,102
We need to get unhooked
and get out of here now!

567
00:45:27,194 --> 00:45:30,231
- All right. Do it, then.
- No problem, except your boys

568
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:34,865
went sightseeing with Flatbed. My people
need Flatbed to get unhooked at their end.

569
00:45:34,954 --> 00:45:36,990
- Back in two hours.
- Two hours?!

570
00:45:37,074 --> 00:45:39,668
We're gonna get the shit kicked out of us
by our pal Fred in two hours!

571
00:45:46,033 --> 00:45:48,991
OK. Set cold tab fitting to 200psi.

572
00:45:49,073 --> 00:45:51,507
- Set.
- There she goes.

573
00:45:51,593 --> 00:45:53,948
- She's breakin'loose.
- Bringin'her up.

574
00:45:54,033 --> 00:45:56,024
OK.

575
00:45:56,113 --> 00:45:57,865
All right.

576
00:45:57,953 --> 00:45:59,944
Clear the hatch.

577
00:46:00,033 --> 00:46:02,024
Go on with it.

578
00:46:02,113 --> 00:46:03,944
Go on. That's it. Up.

579
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:06,547
Sir, the missile looks intact.

580
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:09,784
Little is known about the events
leading up to the collision.

581
00:46:09,873 --> 00:46:12,262
The US Navy guided missile cruiser Appleton

582
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:17,985
apparently struck the Soviet Udaloy class
destroyer in low visibility conditions.

583
00:46:18,073 --> 00:46:21,827
In violent seas, little hope remains
for over 100 Russian crewmen,

584
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:25,872
still missing after the sinking an hour ago.
Soviet military spokesmen

585
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:29,582
have claimed that the collision
constituted an unprovoked attack.

586
00:46:29,673 --> 00:46:32,107
- This was denied by...
- Bud, this is big time.

587
00:46:32,193 --> 00:46:34,707
...who said that Captain Michael Sweeney...

588
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:39,309
- OK. It's clear.
- It's all yours, sir.

589
00:46:39,393 --> 00:46:42,146
I'm gonna swing it away and drop it.

590
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,622
Check. OK.

591
00:46:44,713 --> 00:46:48,911
Bypass the ground connection
on the separation sequencer.

592
00:46:48,993 --> 00:46:52,508
- Got it?
- Separation sequencer disconnected.

593
00:46:52,593 --> 00:46:55,346
Remove explosive bolts one through six

594
00:46:55,433 --> 00:46:59,312
- in counterclockwise sequence.
- Check. Removing bolt one.

595
00:47:07,753 --> 00:47:11,348
Negotiators have walked out
of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks

596
00:47:11,433 --> 00:47:14,231
in protest over the incident this morning.

597
00:47:14,313 --> 00:47:17,623
The deterioration of relations
with the United States...

598
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:20,386
Soviet build-up of tanks
and aircraft has continued.

599
00:47:20,473 --> 00:47:24,705
...this morning, all US and NATO military
forces have been put on full alert.

600
00:47:24,793 --> 00:47:26,784
It's on every channel.

601
00:47:26,873 --> 00:47:28,864
Well, you just feel so helpless.

602
00:47:28,953 --> 00:47:31,467
You can see it coming, but what can you do?

603
00:47:31,553 --> 00:47:33,544
What can anyone do?

604
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:35,942
Hey, I mean, they love their kids too.

605
00:47:36,913 --> 00:47:38,904
So why are we doing this?

606
00:47:38,993 --> 00:47:41,188
If it happens, it happens.

607
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:43,787
There's nothing I can do about it, right?

608
00:47:43,873 --> 00:47:45,864
I just don't think about it.

609
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:01,663
All right! Let's get their gear off! Then
clear the sub! We gotta get it outta here!

610
00:48:04,153 --> 00:48:07,384
Come on, let's go! Let's move it!
One Night, you're up!

611
00:48:07,473 --> 00:48:09,270
Get ready to roll, baby!

612
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,992
- Don't touch that! Just back away.
- Excusez-moi!

613
00:48:14,673 --> 00:48:17,267
Hey, Coffey. We're a little pressed for time.

614
00:48:21,553 --> 00:48:22,747
Prick.

615
00:48:22,873 --> 00:48:25,433
This ain't no drill, Slick. Make me proud.

616
00:48:25,513 --> 00:48:27,504
Piece of cake, baby.

617
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,787
What's the problem, One Night?

618
00:49:02,871 --> 00:49:07,262
All hell must be breaking loose up there.
This cable's pissin'me off!

619
00:49:07,351 --> 00:49:11,469
- I can't get a grip on it.
- Well, keep tryin', baby. Just keep tryin'.

620
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,182
Son of a bitch!

621
00:49:15,391 --> 00:49:17,700
Shit! We got a problem!

622
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:20,988
- What's going on?
- We're losing number two thruster!

623
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:22,823
Bearing's going!

624
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:27,261
It's not holding!
We're swinging out of position here!

625
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:38,188
Jesus!

626
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:46,703
Shit!

627
00:49:56,591 --> 00:49:58,582
The rig is movin'!

628
00:49:58,671 --> 00:50:02,380
Yeah, I can see that. Topside!
Pay out some slack! We're gettin' dragged!

629
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:05,463
Down on number one winch! Down on one!

630
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:12,827
We're headed for the drop-off!

631
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:45,464
What the hell...?
We just lost all the topside feeds!

632
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:49,907
Shit! Get 'em on the UQC.

633
00:50:49,991 --> 00:50:52,585
- Any damage on the hull?
- Bud!

634
00:50:54,391 --> 00:50:56,382
- We lost the crane!
- Say again. What?

635
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:59,031
The crane! We've lost the crane!

636
00:50:59,111 --> 00:51:01,102
It's on its way down to you!

637
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:05,228
All right, everybody!
Everybody rig for impact!

638
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:09,989
Close all the exterior hatches!
Let's move it! Let's go! Go!

639
00:51:12,151 --> 00:51:14,142
- Wait!
- Get in here!

640
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:20,267
- What the hell is goin' on around here?!
- I don't know!

641
00:51:27,391 --> 00:51:29,700
You two help secure the rig! Let's go!

642
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:41,985
One Night! Get the hell outta there!
The crane's comin' down!

643
00:51:50,711 --> 00:51:52,429
I'm OK. I'm clear, Bud.

644
00:52:03,271 --> 00:52:05,865
I've got it! It's headed straight for us!

645
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:09,629
Oh, shit!

646
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:23,148
- Oh, God...
- No!

647
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:25,905
Bud?

648
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,867
Grab onto something!

649
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:33,869
Jesus!

650
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:45,825
- Battery room's flooding! Let's go!
- Cat, put that out!

651
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:51,099
- Bud! The drill room's floodin'!
- Get back down there!

652
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,901
Go! I'll take the battery room!

653
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:57,582
Jesus!

654
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:16,301
Shit!

655
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,983
- Get out of there!
- Close the door!

656
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:23,061
Seal the room!

657
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:33,264
Lindsey! Let's get outta here!

658
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,304
- Hold this on me!
- OK!

659
00:55:28,269 --> 00:55:29,861
Lindsey!

660
00:55:29,949 --> 00:55:31,428
I got it!

661
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:54,344
Let's get the hell outta here!

662
00:55:59,629 --> 00:56:01,620
Let's go!

663
00:56:01,709 --> 00:56:04,746
Hit the door!

664
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:09,340
No!

665
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,900
Bud!

666
00:56:21,429 --> 00:56:24,580
Finler, cut the hose! Cut the line to the motor!

667
00:56:24,669 --> 00:56:26,819
I can't open it from out here!

668
00:56:26,909 --> 00:56:29,946
Finler, cut the hose!

669
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:33,660
Finler!

670
00:56:57,189 --> 00:56:59,180
Hey!

671
00:57:01,389 --> 00:57:02,617
Hey!

672
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:04,860
Hey!

673
00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:09,545
- Come on, Sonny!
- Hey, Cat! Cat, help me out, man!

674
00:57:09,629 --> 00:57:10,982
Hang on!

675
00:57:13,789 --> 00:57:17,498
The hose! Cut the hose!
The line to the motor! Hurry up, man!

676
00:57:21,629 --> 00:57:23,904
Come on, Cat!

677
00:57:23,989 --> 00:57:25,866
Hurry!

678
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:28,668
Come on, Sonny!
Help me out! Come on! Push!

679
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:36,344
- Come on, Sonny! Let's go!
- Come on! Let's go! We gotta go!

680
00:57:36,429 --> 00:57:38,863
Get outta here! Come on! Move it!

681
00:57:38,949 --> 00:57:40,541
Go!

682
00:57:41,189 --> 00:57:42,338
Get the hatch, Cat!

683
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:44,340
Get the hatch!

684
00:57:57,989 --> 00:58:00,901
- You all right? Everybody OK?
- Yeah.

685
00:58:00,989 --> 00:58:02,980
Son of a bitch!

686
00:58:03,069 --> 00:58:03,865
Oh, man!

687
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:14,257
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
This is Deepcore Two. Do you read me?

688
00:58:17,946 --> 00:58:21,461
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
This is Deepcore.

689
00:58:21,546 --> 00:58:23,537
Do you read me? Over.

690
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:25,935
Forget it, Sonny. They're gone, man.

691
00:58:28,826 --> 00:58:30,817
- Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
- Hey.

692
00:58:31,986 --> 00:58:33,977
They're gone.

693
00:58:36,586 --> 00:58:38,577
OK?

694
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:42,057
I just wanna get out of this.

695
00:58:45,346 --> 00:58:47,860
I'd just like to see my wife one more time.

696
00:58:48,506 --> 00:58:51,862
Well, all right, then.
You'd better keep trying, huh?

697
00:58:52,586 --> 00:58:55,498
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
This is Deepcore Two.

698
00:58:57,426 --> 00:59:02,420
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
Do you read me? This is Deepcore Two. Over.

699
00:59:02,506 --> 00:59:04,497
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

700
00:59:32,266 --> 00:59:34,257
Hey, Jammer.

701
00:59:38,306 --> 00:59:41,423
- You got the shakes.
- I know what I got.

702
00:59:41,506 --> 00:59:45,784
I'll deal with it, all right?
I'll deal with me. You deal with yourself.

703
00:59:46,706 --> 00:59:48,697
Find your buddy?

704
00:59:49,466 --> 00:59:51,457
- No.
- Tighter.

705
00:59:52,066 --> 00:59:54,057
- Brigman.
- What?

706
00:59:55,946 --> 00:59:57,937
I was under orders.

707
00:59:58,026 --> 01:00:00,017
I had no choice.

708
01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:16,377
How's it going, Cat?

709
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:29,339
- What's the scoop, ace?
- Well,

710
01:00:29,426 --> 01:00:33,465
I can get power to this module
and sub-bay if I reroute these buses.

711
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:37,141
But I gotta get past the mains,
which are a total meltdown.

712
01:00:38,746 --> 01:00:41,499
But there won't be enough to run the heaters.

713
01:00:41,586 --> 01:00:44,544
In a few hours, this place
is gonna be as cold as a meat locker.

714
01:00:46,544 --> 01:00:47,943
- What about O2?
- Yeah, well, brace yourself.

715
01:00:48,024 --> 01:00:53,018
If we close off the sections we're not using,
we have about maybe 12 hours' worth.

716
01:00:55,224 --> 01:00:58,261
The storm's gonna last
a lot longer than 12 hours.

717
01:00:58,344 --> 01:01:00,335
Yeah, well...

718
01:01:00,424 --> 01:01:02,415
I can maybe extend that. Maybe.

719
01:01:02,504 --> 01:01:06,622
There are some storage tanks outboard
next to the wrecked module.

720
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:09,537
I'll have to go outside, though,
and tie onto them.

721
01:01:13,144 --> 01:01:15,180
Hey, Lins.

722
01:01:15,264 --> 01:01:17,255
- Lins.
- Yeah?

723
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:18,618
I'm glad you're here.

724
01:01:19,944 --> 01:01:21,935
Yeah?

725
01:01:23,024 --> 01:01:24,218
I'm not.

726
01:01:50,663 --> 01:01:54,338
Hey. Found Cab 3.
Deader than dogshit, boss.

727
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:57,381
That girder went right through the brainpan.

728
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,454
Yeah, I see that.

729
01:02:02,143 --> 01:02:04,976
- Where are you?
- Living quarters. Level two.

730
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,214
Jeez!

731
01:02:16,143 --> 01:02:18,134
That's Perry.

732
01:02:21,983 --> 01:02:25,339
That's it, then.
Finler, McWhirter, Dietz and Perry.

733
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,702
Jesus.

734
01:02:30,303 --> 01:02:32,294
We just leave 'em there?

735
01:02:32,383 --> 01:02:36,661
Yeah, for now. We got no choice. Our first
priority is to get somethin' to breathe.

736
01:02:47,343 --> 01:02:49,982
Where are you now, Lins?

737
01:02:50,063 --> 01:02:52,372
I'm under the starboard tri-module.

738
01:02:55,143 --> 01:02:57,976
- Still with me, Hip?
- Right behind you, Lins.

739
01:03:08,023 --> 01:03:11,538
- How's it look?
- Well, you guys really screwed up my rig.

740
01:03:11,623 --> 01:03:15,411
- There's a lot of wreckage out here.
- Well, don't get fouled.

741
01:03:15,503 --> 01:03:18,654
- Hit me with that nine sixteenths, OK?
- Yeah.

742
01:03:18,743 --> 01:03:20,734
Thank you. So...

743
01:03:21,863 --> 01:03:24,252
- There you were.
- Yeah, there we were.

744
01:03:25,663 --> 01:03:28,336
Side by side on the same ship
for two months.

745
01:03:29,543 --> 01:03:33,741
I'm a tool pusher and we're testing
this automated derrick of hers.

746
01:03:33,823 --> 01:03:36,542
We get back on the beach
and we're livin' together.

747
01:03:36,623 --> 01:03:38,693
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.

748
01:03:38,783 --> 01:03:42,173
Well, we were due to go back out
on the same ship. Six months of tests.

749
01:03:42,263 --> 01:03:45,573
If you were married, you got a stateroom.
Otherwise it was bunks.

750
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:50,293
OK. Good reason. Will you come over here
and tighten this for me? Then what?

751
01:03:50,383 --> 01:03:53,375
Then it was all right
there for a while, you know.

752
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:56,933
Then she got promoted
to chief engineer on this thing.

753
01:03:57,023 --> 01:04:01,414
- She went front office on you, man.
- Yeah, well, you know Lindsey.

754
01:04:02,343 --> 01:04:04,379
She's just too damn aggressive.

755
01:04:04,463 --> 01:04:06,260
Son of a bitch!

756
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:10,056
She didn't leave me. She just left me behind.

757
01:04:10,143 --> 01:04:12,179
Bud, let me tell you somethin'.

758
01:04:13,943 --> 01:04:16,616
She ain't half as smart as she thinks she is.

759
01:04:19,623 --> 01:04:20,976
Get outta here.

760
01:04:54,903 --> 01:04:57,497
Come on. Let's see those muscles.

761
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,892
Bingo! That's one.

762
01:05:00,983 --> 01:05:02,974
Two for two.

763
01:05:03,063 --> 01:05:05,054
Hey, hey.

764
01:05:05,863 --> 01:05:07,933
Lindsey, do you read me? Over.

765
01:05:09,183 --> 01:05:11,572
Copy you, Hippy. What's the matter?

766
01:05:12,903 --> 01:05:16,100
Oh, shit.
The power's jackin' around with us again.

767
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:17,980
Lindsey, come back.

768
01:05:18,063 --> 01:05:20,452
I just lost video. Lins, are you there...?

769
01:05:22,223 --> 01:05:24,214
Hippy, do you copy?

770
01:05:27,463 --> 01:05:29,021
Lins, you copy?

771
01:05:29,783 --> 01:05:31,774
Oh, shit!

772
01:05:31,863 --> 01:05:35,094
Oh, what the hell! Hippy, do you copy?

773
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:37,696
Damn it!

774
01:05:37,783 --> 01:05:39,421
Bud, do you copy? Over.

775
01:05:42,463 --> 01:05:44,772
I seem to be having a problem here.

776
01:07:57,703 --> 01:07:59,216
Shit!

777
01:08:11,823 --> 01:08:13,814
Damn it!

778
01:08:44,341 --> 01:08:47,299
- That's a great shot, Lins.
- You drop your dive light?

779
01:08:47,381 --> 01:08:51,693
Come on, you guys. That's the smaller one.
That's the smaller one here.

780
01:08:51,781 --> 01:08:54,659
- You can see how it's zigging around.
- Whatever it is.

781
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:57,653
I'm telling you what it is.
You're just not hearing me.

782
01:08:57,741 --> 01:09:00,574
- Now, Lindsey...
- There is something down there.

783
01:09:00,661 --> 01:09:04,654
- Something not us.
- You could be more... specific.

784
01:09:04,741 --> 01:09:06,732
- Something that zigs.
- Not us.

785
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:09,572
Not human.

786
01:09:09,661 --> 01:09:12,812
Get it? Something non-human but intelligent.

787
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:21,938
A non-terrestrial intelligence.

788
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:24,851
A non-terrestrial intelligence.

789
01:09:24,941 --> 01:09:29,571
NTls. Oh, man, that's better than UFOs.
But that works too.

790
01:09:29,701 --> 01:09:31,498
Underwater Flying Objects.

791
01:09:35,861 --> 01:09:39,331
- Are we talking little space friends here?
- Hell, yeah!

792
01:09:39,421 --> 01:09:41,491
Hot rods of the gods! Right, Lins?

793
01:09:41,581 --> 01:09:43,572
No, no, really. It could be NTls.

794
01:09:43,661 --> 01:09:46,334
- The CIA has known about 'em for ever.
- Step outside.

795
01:09:46,421 --> 01:09:50,130
- They abduct people all the time, man.
- Hippy, would you do me a favour?

796
01:09:50,221 --> 01:09:52,212
Stay off my side.

797
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:55,498
- Will you step into my office, please?
- Certainly.

798
01:09:56,381 --> 01:09:58,372
I... Come here.

799
01:10:00,221 --> 01:10:03,293
- Jesus, Lins!
- Something really important's happening.

800
01:10:03,381 --> 01:10:07,772
I'm trying to keep the situation under control.
I can't allow this kind of hysteria.

801
01:10:07,861 --> 01:10:10,898
Who's hysterical?! Nobody's hysterical!

802
01:10:11,661 --> 01:10:16,052
When you're hanging on by your fingernails,
you don't go waving your arms around.

803
01:10:16,141 --> 01:10:20,851
I saw something. I'm not gonna go in there
and say I didn't see it when I did. I'm sorry.

804
01:10:20,941 --> 01:10:23,774
- Please.
- You are the most stubborn woman I know.

805
01:10:23,861 --> 01:10:25,852
Yes, I am!

806
01:10:25,941 --> 01:10:28,250
But I need you to believe me right now.

807
01:10:28,341 --> 01:10:31,378
Now, come on. Look at me. Come on.
Am I stressed out?

808
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:35,977
Do I have any symptoms of pressure -
sickness, tremors, slurred speech?

809
01:10:36,061 --> 01:10:38,052
- No.
- No.

810
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,096
Bud, this is me - Lindsey. OK?

811
01:10:42,221 --> 01:10:44,974
You know me better
than anybody in the world.

812
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:47,932
Now watch my lips.

813
01:10:48,021 --> 01:10:50,216
I saw these things.

814
01:10:51,101 --> 01:10:55,617
I touched one of them.
And... it wasn't some clunky steel can...

815
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:58,090
...like we would build.

816
01:10:58,941 --> 01:11:00,932
It glided.

817
01:11:01,021 --> 01:11:03,933
It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

818
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,452
Oh, God, I wish you'd been there.

819
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:09,532
It was a machine.

820
01:11:09,621 --> 01:11:14,058
It was a machine, but it was alive.
It was like a... like a dance of light.

821
01:11:16,341 --> 01:11:18,332
Please. You have to trust me.

822
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:22,619
Now, I don't think they mean us any harm.
I don't know how I know that.

823
01:11:22,701 --> 01:11:24,896
It's just... a feeling.

824
01:11:25,901 --> 01:11:29,780
Jesus! I'm supposed to go on a feeling?
How can I go on a feeling?

825
01:11:29,861 --> 01:11:34,651
- You think Coffey's gonna go on a feeling?
- Well, we all see what we wanna see.

826
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:37,301
Coffey looks and he sees Russians.

827
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:39,372
He sees hate and fear.

828
01:11:40,341 --> 01:11:43,014
You have to look with better eyes than that.

829
01:11:48,141 --> 01:11:49,540
Please.

830
01:11:50,061 --> 01:11:51,858
I can't, Lins.

831
01:11:53,501 --> 01:11:55,492
I'm sorry.

832
01:11:57,979 --> 01:11:59,856
All I want is 24-hour surveillance
on exterior cameras.

833
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:03,295
- You've got six people. I've got...
- Comin' through!

834
01:12:03,379 --> 01:12:05,370
Everybody just stop!

835
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:17,057
All right. I want around-the-clock manning
of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.

836
01:12:17,139 --> 01:12:19,289
That Russian bogey comes back,

837
01:12:19,379 --> 01:12:22,689
- I don't think we should be taking a nap.
- Give me a break, Coffey.

838
01:12:22,779 --> 01:12:26,135
Those things live three and a half miles down
in an abyssal trench.

839
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:28,733
Trust me, they're not speaking Russian.

840
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:33,809
Have you finished the repairs

841
01:12:33,899 --> 01:12:36,254
- on the acoustical transmitter yet?
- Nope.

842
01:12:37,579 --> 01:12:41,015
- Why not?
- I was having my nails done.

843
01:12:41,099 --> 01:12:43,090
Well, get it done.

844
01:12:43,179 --> 01:12:45,329
Kiss my ass.

845
01:12:56,699 --> 01:12:58,690
All right.

846
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:01,088
Get something straight.

847
01:13:01,179 --> 01:13:03,329
You people are under my authority.

848
01:13:03,419 --> 01:13:05,728
Look, pardner...

849
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:07,935
we don't work for you.

850
01:13:08,019 --> 01:13:10,010
We don't take orders from you.

851
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:12,775
And we don't much like you.

852
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:17,890
Hey, Cat!

853
01:13:19,579 --> 01:13:20,568
Yeah.

854
01:13:20,659 --> 01:13:24,095
Why don't you take
the first watch on sonar? OK?

855
01:13:26,019 --> 01:13:27,008
Right on.

856
01:13:28,379 --> 01:13:32,258
Sonny, you get a couple of hours' sleep.
Then you spell Cat, all right?

857
01:13:32,339 --> 01:13:35,012
Hippy, you handle exterior surveillance.

858
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:41,573
One Night... Will you do me a favour
and see if you can get that transmitter fixed?

859
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:45,128
- All right?
- Give me a couple of hours.

860
01:13:54,459 --> 01:13:56,450
Got it.

861
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:19,570
All right.

862
01:14:19,659 --> 01:14:23,538
Come on, AJ Squared Away.
A little to the left.

863
01:14:24,739 --> 01:14:26,730
What is...?

864
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:36,733
Oh, this is not happening.

865
01:14:44,099 --> 01:14:47,648
I'm shaking, man. All right. Wait. And now...

866
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:51,737
Here's MIRV!

867
01:14:55,059 --> 01:14:58,688
- Oh, come on, man! What else could it be?
- Why bring it here?

868
01:14:58,779 --> 01:15:03,409
It's gotta be some kind of emergency plan
to keep it away from the Russians, right?

869
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,808
Look, they hot-wire one of the nukes.

870
01:15:05,899 --> 01:15:09,016
They use some kind of detonator
that they brought.

871
01:15:09,099 --> 01:15:12,887
Then they stick it back in the sub.
Fry the whole thing up. Bam!

872
01:15:12,979 --> 01:15:14,970
Slicker than snot.

873
01:15:16,819 --> 01:15:19,652
I'm tellin' you. And I'm not being paranoi...

874
01:15:20,539 --> 01:15:22,530
Hi, Lins.

875
01:15:30,136 --> 01:15:34,971
- Lins, will you just wait a second?
- If you don't do something about it, I will!

876
01:15:35,056 --> 01:15:38,651
- Lindsey, we'll do something about it!
- Fellas?! Hello!

877
01:15:38,736 --> 01:15:42,126
- Lins! Stop and think about this for a second.
- What?

878
01:16:02,216 --> 01:16:06,255
You know, you've got some huevos
bringing that thing into my rig.

879
01:16:06,336 --> 01:16:10,295
With all that's goin' on up in the world,
you bring a nuclear weapon

880
01:16:10,376 --> 01:16:12,173
- in here!
- Mrs Brigman...

881
01:16:12,256 --> 01:16:15,965
Does this strike anyone
as particularly psychotic, or is itjust me?

882
01:16:16,056 --> 01:16:19,492
Mrs Brigman, you don't need to know
the details of our operation.

883
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:22,886
- It's better if you don't.
- You're right! I don't need to know!

884
01:16:22,976 --> 01:16:27,766
What I need to know is that thing is
off this rig! Do you hear me, Roger Ramjet?!

885
01:16:28,816 --> 01:16:32,172
You're becoming
a serious impediment to our mission.

886
01:16:32,256 --> 01:16:36,772
Now, you either do an about-face and walk
out of here, or I'll have you escorted out.

887
01:16:36,856 --> 01:16:39,848
I will not do an about-face and get outta here!

888
01:16:39,936 --> 01:16:45,056
- Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
- Emergency! Maintenance Room B! Move it!

889
01:16:45,136 --> 01:16:46,694
On the double!

890
01:16:46,776 --> 01:16:48,334
Now!

891
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:52,648
- In here! Come on! We got trouble! Come on!
- What's goin' on?

892
01:16:52,776 --> 01:16:55,734
All right!

893
01:16:55,816 --> 01:16:59,411
- What's up? What's happening?
- You let her go, man. Do it.

894
01:16:59,496 --> 01:17:01,214
Do it now!

895
01:17:01,296 --> 01:17:02,854
Let her go.

896
01:17:05,336 --> 01:17:07,327
The smartest thing you ever did.

897
01:17:10,576 --> 01:17:13,295
- Coffey, you son of a bitch!
- Lindsey! Cool it.

898
01:17:13,376 --> 01:17:17,892
- What's the problem?
- Nothing. We were just leaving. Weren't we?

899
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,727
We don't need them.

900
01:17:40,816 --> 01:17:42,807
We can't trust them.

901
01:17:45,816 --> 01:17:47,807
We may have to take steps.

902
01:17:51,336 --> 01:17:53,327
We're gonna have to take steps.

903
01:17:57,776 --> 01:18:01,371
Lins, I want you
to stay away from that guy. I mean it.

904
01:18:01,456 --> 01:18:03,970
The guy is gone. Did you see his hands?

905
01:18:04,056 --> 01:18:06,206
What? He's got the shakes?

906
01:18:06,296 --> 01:18:10,608
Look, he's operating on his own.
He's cut off from his chain of command.

907
01:18:10,696 --> 01:18:13,893
He's showing signs
of pressure-induced psychosis.

908
01:18:13,976 --> 01:18:15,967
And he's got a nuclear weapon.

909
01:18:16,056 --> 01:18:20,971
So, as a personal favour to me, will you try
to put your tongue in neutral for a while?

910
01:18:21,056 --> 01:18:24,526
I gotta tell you. I give this whole thing
a sphincter factor of about 9.5.

911
01:19:02,597 --> 01:19:06,476
You can just punch into his primary
guidance chip where you want him to go

912
01:19:06,557 --> 01:19:09,708
- and he'll go there, right?
- No. Bad idea, Lindsey.

913
01:19:09,797 --> 01:19:10,991
Why, Hip? Come on.

914
01:19:11,077 --> 01:19:15,992
Because even if it could take the pressure
at that depth, which I don't think it can,

915
01:19:16,077 --> 01:19:21,105
without the tether, you know what would
happen? It would just sit like a dumb shit.

916
01:19:21,197 --> 01:19:25,190
Something would have to pass
in front of the camera for you to see anything.

917
01:19:25,277 --> 01:19:27,950
But we could get lucky.
So we should go for it.

918
01:19:28,037 --> 01:19:30,471
I really ought to talk to Bud about this.

919
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:35,028
No. This is between you and me. We get
proof and then we tell the others. Hippy, look.

920
01:19:35,117 --> 01:19:39,315
If we can prove to Coffey
that there aren't Russians down there,

921
01:19:39,397 --> 01:19:42,309
maybe he'll ease off the button a little bit.

922
01:19:42,397 --> 01:19:47,312
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me more
than anything we're gonna find down there.

923
01:19:47,397 --> 01:19:51,595
He's a goddamn
AJ Squared Away jarhead robot!

924
01:19:54,637 --> 01:19:57,231
Give me a couple of hours.
I'll see what I can do.

925
01:19:57,317 --> 01:19:58,875
Great. Thanks.

926
01:20:07,117 --> 01:20:09,108
How's that?

927
01:20:12,437 --> 01:20:14,428
Thanks.

928
01:20:35,637 --> 01:20:37,628
Virgil, turn on your side.

929
01:21:06,077 --> 01:21:08,750
All right. You're all set, big guy.

930
01:21:08,837 --> 01:21:11,670
Hey, I told you to wipe that grin off your face.

931
01:21:20,517 --> 01:21:22,508
Good night, little buddy.

932
01:23:06,637 --> 01:23:08,867
Bud!

933
01:23:08,957 --> 01:23:10,948
Get up!

934
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:25,948
Cat?

935
01:23:26,997 --> 01:23:28,191
Cat!

936
01:23:28,277 --> 01:23:31,030
Hey! Goddamn... Leave me alone.

937
01:23:39,157 --> 01:23:41,113
Bud!

938
01:23:43,637 --> 01:23:45,787
No, wait. It's OK.

939
01:23:45,877 --> 01:23:48,027
Sweet Christ almighty!

940
01:23:48,117 --> 01:23:50,506
I think it likes you.

941
01:24:08,157 --> 01:24:10,387
It's trying to communicate.

942
01:24:12,077 --> 01:24:14,068
It's Bud.

943
01:24:17,397 --> 01:24:19,991
- It's wonderful!
- It's me!

944
01:24:22,837 --> 01:24:25,067
- No. Don't...
- It's OK.

945
01:24:29,877 --> 01:24:31,868
Is it alive?

946
01:24:34,837 --> 01:24:36,828
Lindsey, no...

947
01:24:38,277 --> 01:24:40,233
Seawater.

948
01:24:40,317 --> 01:24:42,148
Oh, man.

949
01:24:54,557 --> 01:24:56,593
Come on!

950
01:24:58,517 --> 01:25:00,906
- Hurry!
- Where the hell's it going?

951
01:25:11,117 --> 01:25:13,585
Hurry! I think it's headed for B module!

952
01:25:13,677 --> 01:25:15,668
Lins, you see it?

953
01:26:13,276 --> 01:26:17,906
So, raise your hand if you think
it was a Russian water tentacle.

954
01:26:17,996 --> 01:26:19,634
Lieutenant?

955
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:21,707
No? Well...

956
01:26:22,676 --> 01:26:24,667
A breakthrough.

957
01:26:24,756 --> 01:26:25,950
Hey, ace,

958
01:26:26,036 --> 01:26:30,666
- you done impressing yourself?
- No way that thing could just be seawater.

959
01:26:30,756 --> 01:26:35,466
They must have learned to control water.
I mean, at a molecular level.

960
01:26:35,556 --> 01:26:39,469
They can plasticise it, pulverise it,
do whatever they wanna do with it.

961
01:26:39,556 --> 01:26:44,471
- They can put it under intelligent control.
- Maybe... their whole technology

962
01:26:44,556 --> 01:26:47,389
is based on that-controlling water.

963
01:26:48,516 --> 01:26:51,633
Was it the same thing
that you saw the last time?

964
01:26:51,716 --> 01:26:52,910
No.

965
01:26:52,996 --> 01:26:56,591
You know, I don't think that
that thing you saw was one of them.

966
01:26:56,676 --> 01:27:00,146
- What are you talkin' about?
- I mean, I don't think it was an NTI.

967
01:27:00,236 --> 01:27:03,592
I think it was like their version of an ROV.
Like Big Geek.

968
01:27:03,676 --> 01:27:06,827
Hippy, you mean
they was just checkin' us out?

969
01:27:06,916 --> 01:27:08,907
- Yeah.
- How come?

970
01:27:08,996 --> 01:27:10,987
Curious, I suppose.

971
01:27:11,076 --> 01:27:14,273
We're probably the first people
they've ever seen.

972
01:27:30,236 --> 01:27:33,865
It went straight for the warhead.
And they think it's cute!

973
01:27:52,316 --> 01:27:54,307
You need to get some sleep.

974
01:28:03,556 --> 01:28:04,955
We have no...

975
01:28:05,756 --> 01:28:08,395
...way of warning the surface.

976
01:28:09,596 --> 01:28:11,587
And you know what that means?

977
01:28:13,796 --> 01:28:15,787
It means whatever happens...

978
01:28:16,836 --> 01:28:18,827
...is up to us.

979
01:28:19,996 --> 01:28:21,793
Us.

980
01:29:26,674 --> 01:29:31,145
So you think they're from down there
originally? Or from...

981
01:29:31,234 --> 01:29:33,225
...you know.

982
01:29:33,314 --> 01:29:35,305
I don't know.

983
01:29:35,394 --> 01:29:38,466
I think... I think they're from "you know".

984
01:29:38,554 --> 01:29:40,863
Someplace with similar conditions.

985
01:29:40,954 --> 01:29:43,627
- Cold, intense pressure.
- Oh, man!

986
01:29:43,714 --> 01:29:46,831
Happy as hogs in a waller down there,
probably.

987
01:30:42,954 --> 01:30:44,945
Sniff something?

988
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:50,225
Did you, rat boy?

989
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:56,588
Hey!

990
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:58,023
Freeze!

991
01:30:58,110 --> 01:31:00,340
Don't move!

992
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:02,148
That's right.

993
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:05,426
- OK, Hip?
- They're using Big Geek

994
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:07,899
- to take the bomb to the NTls.
- What?

995
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:09,946
We set it up to go right to 'em.

996
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:11,622
Oh, my God!

997
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:16,623
Take this. We're going to Phase Three.

998
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:18,940
What? We don't have orders for that!

999
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:23,421
I programmed Big Geek to go down to the
bottom of the trench and shoot some video.

1000
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:26,070
- Now they got the warhead tied to it.
- Coffey.

1001
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:33,702
Coffey... Come on, Coffey.
Just think about what you're doing, OK?

1002
01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:36,020
Just think about what you're doing!

1003
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:38,940
Get back!

1004
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:43,182
This is something I've wanted to do
since we first met.

1005
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:52,381
Take it easy.

1006
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:59,262
- All right! Into the kitchen! Let's go! Move!
- Get your damn hands off of me!

1007
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:01,341
I know the way.

1008
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:04,467
Your boss is fixin' to pull the pin
on 50 kilotons.

1009
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:06,905
And we're all gonna be ringside!

1010
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:08,981
He's havin' a full-on meltdown!

1011
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:11,584
- What's the timer set for?
- Three hours.

1012
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:13,786
- Shut up! Don't talk.
- Three hours.

1013
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:17,146
We can't get to minimum safe distance
in three hours.

1014
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:20,302
We can't go to Phase Three.
What about these people?

1015
01:32:20,390 --> 01:32:22,620
Shut up! What's the matter with you?

1016
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:32,419
Everybody just stay calm.
The situation is under control.

1017
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:40,099
Anybody touches that door, kill 'em.

1018
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:47,700
Shoenick! Your lieutenant's
about to make a real bad career move!

1019
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:50,099
The guy is crazier than a shithouse rat!

1020
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:53,262
- Can't you see he's lost it?
- Shut up!

1021
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:55,784
- The shock wave'll kill us.
- Quiet!

1022
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:57,986
It'll crush this rig like a beer can.

1023
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:00,425
- Shut up, man!
- We gotta stop him.

1024
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:01,909
Shut up!

1025
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:05,619
This is not our mission.
We can't detonate without orders.

1026
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:21,943
He's about to declare war on an alien species

1027
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:25,261
just when they're trying
to make contact with us. Please!

1028
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:29,229
- I don't know. I think I'm reaching him.
- Yeah!

1029
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:32,341
I'll be damned.

1030
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:37,181
- Jammer.
- Is everybody OK?

1031
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:40,585
Oh, man!

1032
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:43,946
- Don't move, jarface!
- Look, I'm the least of your problems.

1033
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:46,863
Take it easy, Hippy.
How you feeling, big guy?

1034
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:48,941
I'm OK, Bud. I...

1035
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:54,903
I just... figured I was dead back there
when I saw that angel coming for me.

1036
01:33:57,990 --> 01:34:01,187
Yeah, OK.
Yeah. Why don't you tell us about it later?

1037
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:10,662
- Come on.
- He's got it tied off with something.

1038
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:12,741
Come on. Ready?

1039
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:19,708
- We're not gonna be able to budge it.
- Now what? This is the only door to sub-bay.

1040
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:34,347
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna swim to hatch six.

1041
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:36,421
What?!

1042
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:38,387
I'm gonna get inside

1043
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:42,258
- and open the door from the other side.
- Bud, this water is freezing.

1044
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:45,823
Then I guess you'd better wish me luck, huh?

1045
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:48,265
- Wish us luck.
- You comin' along?

1046
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,703
Looks that way.

1047
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:53,783
- All right, Cat.
- Come on, Bud.

1048
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:57,627
- In case I don't die...
- This is insane.

1049
01:34:57,710 --> 01:35:01,146
Come on, Bud.
Let's go, pardner. I ain't got all day.

1050
01:35:58,350 --> 01:36:00,341
Come on. Yank on it.

1051
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:07,701
We have to...

1052
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:09,781
We have to go to the moon pool.

1053
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:12,384
- It's the only way.
- I can't.

1054
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:14,665
I can't make it, pardner.

1055
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:16,741
I'm sorry.

1056
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:20,499
OK, Cat.

1057
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:22,581
You head on back, all right?

1058
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:55,509
- What is he doing?
- He can't make it to the door.

1059
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:59,947
- He's gonna try and take him out himself.
- No. God, he couldn't be that dumb.

1060
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:02,066
That guy's a trained killer.

1061
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:50,589
No!

1062
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:53,230
Coffey... Coffey, listen.

1063
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:08,620
Hey!

1064
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:25,588
Hey!

1065
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:43,863
- Bud, you all right?
- Get him, Cat!

1066
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:52,747
- He's dogged it, Bud!
- We gotta get this off of here.

1067
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:58,459
Come on. Help me. Pull the gripper!

1068
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:11,581
Cat, get the door!

1069
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:21,659
Shit!

1070
01:41:22,790 --> 01:41:24,189
Come on!

1071
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:26,785
Shoot!

1072
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:27,859
You all right?

1073
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:29,986
The safety's on!

1074
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:32,026
Give me that!

1075
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:39,945
Come on! Let's go! Help me out!
Gimme a hand. Let's move it.

1076
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:43,545
- One Night, what about Cab 1?
- Ready to launch.

1077
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:47,143
Go! You're better in these than I am.

1078
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:49,346
You got air? Come on.

1079
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:53,620
You got air.

1080
01:42:43,230 --> 01:42:45,221
Shit!

1081
01:44:12,230 --> 01:44:15,700
Bud, get out of the way!

1082
01:44:21,230 --> 01:44:23,186
Shit!

1083
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:45,981
Get in! Hurry up!

1084
01:44:46,590 --> 01:44:49,787
I'm comin', baby! Keep your pantyhose on.

1085
01:44:58,910 --> 01:45:00,901
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1086
01:45:04,390 --> 01:45:07,188
- Do you see Big Geek?
- Yeah. Right out in front.

1087
01:45:15,070 --> 01:45:17,379
Oh, my God! OK. Get on the arm.

1088
01:45:17,470 --> 01:45:20,462
- To the left. A little more.
- You missed. Try it again.

1089
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:22,222
Steady.

1090
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:23,823
- Grab it!
- Yeah, got it!

1091
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:26,663
- Pretty slick, Slick.
- Hold it really steady.

1092
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:29,264
- Hold it still.
- I am.

1093
01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:41,501
Shit! We lost Geek!

1094
01:45:47,230 --> 01:45:49,266
Where is he, Bud? Do you see him?

1095
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:51,306
I'll take a look.

1096
01:45:52,990 --> 01:45:55,424
- He's comin' up fast. Step on it!
- Shit!

1097
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:09,266
- Go to the right! Swing to the right!
- Shit!

1098
01:46:24,150 --> 01:46:26,141
Keep movin', baby!

1099
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:28,979
Come here.

1100
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:36,749
Son of a bitch!

1101
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:46,420
Hard left, baby! Left!

1102
01:47:00,070 --> 01:47:01,628
Jesus Christ, lady!

1103
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:04,224
If you think you can do any better,
you're welcome!

1104
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:12,381
Son of a bitch!

1105
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:17,020
- Is he right on us?
- Right on your ass.

1106
01:47:17,110 --> 01:47:18,509
OK.

1107
01:47:18,590 --> 01:47:20,581
- Where you goin'?
- Hang on!

1108
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:02,620
Deepcore, this is Cab 1. Do you read?

1109
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:07,628
Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab 1. Over.

1110
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:11,821
I'm not getting any answer!

1111
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:14,984
And we're flooding like a son of a bitch.

1112
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:17,061
Yeah. You noticed?

1113
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:19,141
You did OK back there, Virgil.

1114
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:22,267
- I was fairly impressed.
- Yeah, well, not good enough.

1115
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:26,138
- We still gotta catch Big Geek.
- Yeah, well, not in this thing.

1116
01:49:26,230 --> 01:49:28,744
Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab 1. Over.

1117
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:33,822
Try it again.

1118
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:35,866
Deepcore, this is Cab 1. We need a...

1119
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:40,544
You all right?

1120
01:49:41,670 --> 01:49:43,979
Yeah.

1121
01:49:48,870 --> 01:49:50,269
Well, that's that.

1122
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:52,341
Yeah, wonderful.

1123
01:49:53,150 --> 01:49:56,540
There's some light comin' from somewhere.
Off to the right.

1124
01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:58,621
Yeah, that's the rig.

1125
01:49:58,710 --> 01:50:00,701
It's a good 60, 70 yards, I'd say.

1126
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:02,781
Well, they'll come after us.

1127
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:07,625
Yeah, but it's gonna take 'em a while to get
here. We gotta get this flooding stopped.

1128
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:13,226
- Can you see where it's coming in?
- Yeah. Can you hold the lamp?

1129
01:50:13,310 --> 01:50:18,464
There's a busted fitting behind this panel.
Problem is I don't think I can get to it.

1130
01:50:20,270 --> 01:50:23,660
- You got any tools?
- Uh, I don't know. I'll have to look around.

1131
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:25,741
Yeah, well, I looked already.

1132
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:31,106
Goddamn it!
All I need's a goddamn crescent wrench!

1133
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:35,341
Come on.

1134
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:42,581
Son of a bitch!

1135
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:44,501
OK. Calm down, Bud.

1136
01:50:45,470 --> 01:50:47,461
- Calm down.
- OK.

1137
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:52,501
OK.

1138
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:56,221
We gotta get you outta here.

1139
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:58,301
- How?
- I don't know how.

1140
01:50:58,390 --> 01:51:02,144
- All right. We've only got one suit.
- We gotta come up with something.

1141
01:51:02,230 --> 01:51:05,825
- Oh, my God! I'm freezing!
- Come here. Give me your hands.

1142
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:09,619
Listen, you're smart. Think of something.
Can't you think of something?

1143
01:51:09,710 --> 01:51:13,020
OK. Why don't you swim back to the rig
and bring back another suit?

1144
01:51:14,510 --> 01:51:19,982
That'll take me about seven or eight minutes
to swim, get the gear, and come back.

1145
01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:24,266
I wouldn't make it.
By the time I got back, you'd be...

1146
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:25,669
OK.

1147
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:28,901
Let's look around. Let's look. Oh, my God!

1148
01:51:30,990 --> 01:51:32,981
Is that working?

1149
01:51:33,710 --> 01:51:35,302
Shit!

1150
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:47,302
All right.

1151
01:51:48,150 --> 01:51:49,742
Here. You put this on.

1152
01:51:49,830 --> 01:51:53,505
- No! Are you growing gills all of a sudden?
- Don't argue with me, goddamn it!

1153
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:58,027
- This is not an option, so forget about it!
- Lindsey, shut up and put this thing on!

1154
01:51:58,110 --> 01:52:00,829
- If you'd be logical...
- Fuck logic!

1155
01:52:00,910 --> 01:52:04,869
Listen to me. You've got the suit on
and you're a better swimmer than I am, right?

1156
01:52:04,950 --> 01:52:07,783
- Yeah, maybe.
- Right? Yes! So I've got a plan.

1157
01:52:07,870 --> 01:52:10,862
- What's the plan?
- I drown, and you tow me back to the rig.

1158
01:52:10,950 --> 01:52:12,303
No!

1159
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:15,587
Yes! This water's only
a couple of degrees above freezing.

1160
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:19,743
I'll... go into deep hypothermia.
My blood'll go like ice water.

1161
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:22,867
My body systems will slow down.
They won't stop.

1162
01:52:22,950 --> 01:52:27,148
You tow me back and I can...
I can be revived after maybe

1163
01:52:27,230 --> 01:52:30,063
- 10 or 15 minutes.
- Lins, put this on! You put it on!

1164
01:52:30,150 --> 01:52:33,904
It's the only way! You just put this on!
Put this on. You know I'm right.

1165
01:52:33,990 --> 01:52:39,064
Please! It's the only way. You've got
all the... stuff on the rig to do this.

1166
01:52:39,150 --> 01:52:41,345
Put this on. Bud, please!

1167
01:52:42,510 --> 01:52:44,501
- This is insane.
- I know.

1168
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:46,581
Oh, my God.

1169
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:48,661
- Are you OK?
- It's the only way.

1170
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:50,741
All right. Here. Hold this.

1171
01:52:53,070 --> 01:52:55,061
Son of a bitch. Hold on, Lindsey.

1172
01:52:57,550 --> 01:52:59,541
You can do this, you know.

1173
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:06,704
- You can do this.
- God, Lins... I...

1174
01:53:06,790 --> 01:53:08,781
I know. You can tell me later.

1175
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:28,460
This is maybe not such a good idea!

1176
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:31,469
Oh, my God!

1177
01:53:32,550 --> 01:53:34,541
Bud! No!

1178
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:46,227
I can't! Oh, Bud, I'm scared!

1179
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:18,704
No!

1180
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:42,708
I got him!

1181
01:54:42,790 --> 01:54:44,940
- Where?
- Oh, my God! It's Lindsey.

1182
01:54:45,030 --> 01:54:48,102
- Deepcore, do you read? Over.
- Yeah, we got you, Bud.

1183
01:54:48,190 --> 01:54:50,340
- We're here.
- Go to the infirmary.

1184
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:53,228
Get the cart oxygen, defib kit,

1185
01:54:53,310 --> 01:54:58,100
adrenaline in a 10cc syringe,
and some heating blankets. You got all that?

1186
01:54:58,190 --> 01:55:00,863
- Got it.
- Meet me at the moon pool and make it fast!

1187
01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:02,508
Now! Come on! Let's go!

1188
01:55:02,590 --> 01:55:04,581
Hippy, get the hot packs!

1189
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:06,661
Got 'em!

1190
01:55:21,390 --> 01:55:23,745
Here he comes!

1191
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:32,620
- Watch her head.
- I got it. I got it.

1192
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:34,701
Watch her feet.

1193
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:38,779
Watch her head comin' down. Watch...

1194
01:55:45,070 --> 01:55:47,504
Clear it out. Is she clear?

1195
01:55:47,590 --> 01:55:49,865
Get the defib ready. Hurry up, Cat.

1196
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:51,941
OK. Got it.

1197
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:55,301
- OK?
- Yeah.

1198
01:55:55,390 --> 01:55:57,904
Three one thousand... four one thousand...

1199
01:55:57,990 --> 01:55:59,981
Breathe.

1200
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:03,540
One one thousand...
two one thousand... three one thousand...

1201
01:56:03,630 --> 01:56:06,827
No! You gotta have bare skin or it won't work!

1202
01:56:06,910 --> 01:56:09,663
Three one thousand... four one thousand...

1203
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:11,581
Here.

1204
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:13,388
Is that right?

1205
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:15,142
- I got it.
- Well, do it!

1206
01:56:15,230 --> 01:56:17,186
Breathe!

1207
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:19,830
- Come on! Zap her!
- Clear!

1208
01:56:21,070 --> 01:56:23,459
- Come on, baby! Oh, Christ!
- Nothing.

1209
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:25,142
Breathe.

1210
01:56:25,230 --> 01:56:29,701
- I'll jack it up to three hundred.
- Do it again, One Night. Zap her again.

1211
01:56:29,790 --> 01:56:32,224
It's going, it's going. It's charging.

1212
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:34,301
Charging...

1213
01:56:35,470 --> 01:56:36,789
- Now!
- Clear!

1214
01:56:38,310 --> 01:56:40,301
- Anything?
- No pulse.

1215
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:42,824
- Come on, baby!
- Charging one more time.

1216
01:56:42,910 --> 01:56:45,105
Zap her again. Come on!

1217
01:56:46,430 --> 01:56:48,421
- Come on!
- Clear!

1218
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:52,501
God! No pulse.

1219
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:54,740
It's flat. Goddamn! It's flat.

1220
01:56:54,830 --> 01:56:56,946
Get outta here.

1221
01:56:57,030 --> 01:57:00,306
One, two, three, four, five one thousand.

1222
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:02,904
One, two, three, four... breathe!

1223
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:06,421
One, two, three, four... breathe!

1224
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:16,105
Come on, baby.
One one thousand, two one thousand,

1225
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:19,307
three one thousand, four one thousand...

1226
01:57:19,390 --> 01:57:23,747
Come on, baby. One one thousand,
two one thousand, three one thousand...

1227
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:27,743
Come on, baby! Breathe! Come on!
Two one thousand, three one thousand...

1228
01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:29,821
Bud...

1229
01:57:32,310 --> 01:57:34,301
It's all over, man.

1230
01:57:36,830 --> 01:57:38,821
It's all over.

1231
01:57:38,910 --> 01:57:41,105
I'm sorry.

1232
01:57:41,190 --> 01:57:43,181
No pulse.

1233
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:06,301
No!

1234
01:58:06,390 --> 01:58:08,904
No, she has a strong heart!
She wants to live!

1235
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:10,981
Come on, Lins! Come on, baby!

1236
01:58:43,150 --> 01:58:45,584
- Zap her again! Do it!
- Charging.

1237
01:58:45,670 --> 01:58:47,661
Do it!

1238
01:58:53,550 --> 01:58:54,539
Clear.

1239
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:56,621
Clear!

1240
01:58:58,670 --> 01:59:00,661
Get outta here!

1241
01:59:06,870 --> 01:59:09,703
Come on. Breathe, baby.
Goddamn it! Breathe!

1242
01:59:09,790 --> 01:59:14,341
Goddamn it, you bitch! You never backed
away from anything in your life! Now fight!

1243
01:59:14,430 --> 01:59:16,421
Fight!

1244
01:59:16,510 --> 01:59:18,705
Right now! Do it!

1245
01:59:18,790 --> 01:59:20,781
Fight, goddamn it!

1246
01:59:21,630 --> 01:59:23,825
Fight!

1247
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:25,309
Fight!

1248
01:59:25,390 --> 01:59:28,268
Fight!

1249
01:59:33,630 --> 01:59:35,621
Lins? That's it, Lindsey.

1250
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:37,701
That's it, Lins. You can do it.

1251
01:59:37,790 --> 01:59:40,543
That's it, Lins. Come on back, baby. Come on.

1252
01:59:40,630 --> 01:59:42,621
You can do it, baby.

1253
01:59:52,030 --> 01:59:54,021
Get her some air.

1254
01:59:54,110 --> 01:59:56,101
Breathe.

1255
01:59:59,750 --> 02:00:01,741
You did it, ace!

1256
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:03,821
God!

1257
02:00:17,110 --> 02:00:19,101
Make sure her heart's OK.

1258
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:37,341
Big boys don't cry, remember?

1259
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:45,501
Hi, lady.

1260
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:48,541
Hi, tough guy.

1261
02:00:51,430 --> 02:00:53,421
I guess it worked, didn't it?

1262
02:00:53,510 --> 02:00:55,501
Yeah. Of course it did.

1263
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:58,781
You're never wrong, are you?

1264
02:01:01,470 --> 02:01:04,064
How you feelin'?

1265
02:01:04,150 --> 02:01:06,141
I feel better.

1266
02:01:07,390 --> 02:01:09,460
What did you do to me?

1267
02:01:14,990 --> 02:01:16,981
Next time it's your turn, OK?

1268
02:01:19,710 --> 02:01:21,701
Yeah, you got that right.

1269
02:01:22,790 --> 02:01:27,306
These are so your eyes can focus
in the breathing fluid. How's that feel?

1270
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:30,063
If you can't see, you can't disarm the bomb.

1271
02:01:30,150 --> 02:01:33,745
OK. With this much weight,
you're gonna fall like a brick.

1272
02:01:35,030 --> 02:01:39,228
We've still got about an hour,
so you should get there in plenty of time.

1273
02:01:39,310 --> 02:01:44,543
When you get down there, all you gotta do is
cut a wire, drop the weights and come home.

1274
02:01:47,310 --> 02:01:51,747
- Hand me that wrench.
- Maybe I oughta check everything.

1275
02:01:53,790 --> 02:01:56,543
That's loose. I'll fix that up.

1276
02:01:56,630 --> 02:01:59,542
Bud, you don't have to do this.

1277
02:02:00,190 --> 02:02:02,181
Somebody's gotta do it.

1278
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:04,226
It doesn't have to be you.

1279
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:06,904
Who then?

1280
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:13,860
So, what, I can hear you
but I can't talk, right?

1281
02:02:13,950 --> 02:02:17,147
The fluid prevents the larynx
from making sound. Excuse me.

1282
02:02:17,230 --> 02:02:19,983
- It'll feel a little strange.
- Yeah, no shit.

1283
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:23,426
I gotta warn you all... I'm a pretty lousy typist.

1284
02:02:27,070 --> 02:02:29,026
The moment of truth.

1285
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:32,301
Come on. Let's go.

1286
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:33,979
Easy.

1287
02:02:36,670 --> 02:02:39,025
- I need it in the front a little bit.
- OK.

1288
02:02:39,110 --> 02:02:41,704
- Thank you.
- You got it.

1289
02:02:41,790 --> 02:02:43,428
- Set.
- Clamp?

1290
02:02:43,510 --> 02:02:44,499
Set.

1291
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:57,229
OK, let's rock and roll!

1292
02:02:57,310 --> 02:02:59,346
Crack it.

1293
02:02:59,750 --> 02:03:01,900
Headset, please.

1294
02:03:03,990 --> 02:03:06,026
- OK.
- Relax now, Bud. Just relax.

1295
02:03:07,430 --> 02:03:09,148
- Bud.
- Relax now, Bud.

1296
02:03:09,230 --> 02:03:10,219
Watch me.

1297
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:12,346
OK? Watch me. Watch me.

1298
02:03:12,430 --> 02:03:14,898
Don't hold your breath. Take it in.

1299
02:03:14,990 --> 02:03:17,663
Just let yourself take it in. Take it in.

1300
02:03:19,390 --> 02:03:22,427
That's it. Don't hold your breath now.
There you go.

1301
02:03:22,510 --> 02:03:25,229
Don't hold your breath. Take it in. That's it.

1302
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:27,949
- There you go.
- Bud!

1303
02:03:28,030 --> 02:03:29,861
This is not normal!

1304
02:03:29,950 --> 02:03:33,226
It's normal! Lt'll pass in a second!
It's perfectly normal!

1305
02:03:33,310 --> 02:03:35,619
- It's not normal.
- It's perfectly normal.

1306
02:03:35,710 --> 02:03:39,908
We all breathe liquid for nine months, Bud.
Your body will remember. That's it.

1307
02:03:39,990 --> 02:03:42,026
That's it.

1308
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:44,829
- Perfectly normal.
- Christ! He's breathing!

1309
02:03:44,910 --> 02:03:46,901
Give me that.

1310
02:03:47,710 --> 02:03:50,099
- Can you hear me?
- There he goes.

1311
02:03:50,190 --> 02:03:52,579
Yes? OK. Bud...

1312
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:54,979
Try your keypad.

1313
02:04:08,830 --> 02:04:10,786
I already have.

1314
02:04:13,150 --> 02:04:15,106
Great.

1315
02:04:15,190 --> 02:04:17,226
Let's go!

1316
02:04:22,870 --> 02:04:25,384
- Hippy, you got that?
- Hold on, Jammer.

1317
02:04:25,470 --> 02:04:27,506
Easy.

1318
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:30,184
Watch out. Watch his back. Watch the back.

1319
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:33,421
Careful.

1320
02:04:34,950 --> 02:04:38,784
I redid Little Geek's chip
the same as Big Geek!

1321
02:04:38,870 --> 02:04:41,020
It should take you straight there!

1322
02:04:41,110 --> 02:04:43,465
All you have to do is hang on!

1323
02:06:25,429 --> 02:06:27,420
What's his depth?

1324
02:06:27,509 --> 02:06:30,182
- 3200 feet.
- Your depth is 3200 feet.

1325
02:06:30,269 --> 02:06:33,944
You're doing fine. Now,
you better watch out for crane wreckage.

1326
02:06:34,029 --> 02:06:36,099
You should be almost to it.

1327
02:06:46,229 --> 02:06:48,220
4800 feet. It's official.

1328
02:06:48,309 --> 02:06:49,947
Yeah.

1329
02:06:50,029 --> 02:06:53,908
Bud, according to Monk here, you just
set a record for the deepest suit dive.

1330
02:06:53,989 --> 02:06:57,664
Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this
when you got up this morning, huh?

1331
02:07:06,109 --> 02:07:09,101
One mile down. Still grinnin'.

1332
02:07:24,069 --> 02:07:26,060
8500 feet.

1333
02:07:27,349 --> 02:07:29,340
8500 feet, Bud.

1334
02:07:29,429 --> 02:07:31,420
Everything OK?

1335
02:07:32,949 --> 02:07:37,340
Ask him about pressure effects.
Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.

1336
02:07:38,469 --> 02:07:40,858
Ensign Monk wants to know how you feel.

1337
02:07:52,549 --> 02:07:55,586
It's starting. It hits the nervous system first.

1338
02:07:55,669 --> 02:07:57,705
Keep talking. Let him hear your voice.

1339
02:07:57,789 --> 02:07:59,780
OK, Bud. Your depth is 8900 feet.

1340
02:07:59,869 --> 02:08:03,305
- You're doing fine.
- No, Lindsey.

1341
02:08:03,389 --> 02:08:05,380
Talk to him.

1342
02:08:12,029 --> 02:08:14,179
Bud...

1343
02:08:14,269 --> 02:08:17,579
There's some... some things I need to say.

1344
02:08:19,309 --> 02:08:21,300
It's hard for me, you know.

1345
02:08:22,789 --> 02:08:25,178
It's not easy being a cast-iron bitch.

1346
02:08:25,829 --> 02:08:28,946
It takes discipline and years of training.

1347
02:08:29,029 --> 02:08:31,543
A lot of people don't appreciate that.

1348
02:08:35,029 --> 02:08:38,658
Jesus, I'm sorry
I can't tell you these things to your face.

1349
02:08:38,749 --> 02:08:40,421
I have to wait till you're alone in the dark,

1350
02:08:41,507 --> 02:08:45,295
freezing, and there's 10,000 feet
of water between us.

1351
02:08:46,947 --> 02:08:49,142
I'm sorry. I'm rambling.

1352
02:09:01,867 --> 02:09:03,903
Comin' up on the big ten thou.

1353
02:09:10,427 --> 02:09:12,418
12,000 feet. Jesus!

1354
02:09:12,507 --> 02:09:14,816
- I don't believe he's doin' this!
- Hippy!

1355
02:09:14,907 --> 02:09:17,580
Shut up! What's wrong with you?

1356
02:09:20,587 --> 02:09:22,578
Bud, how are you doing?

1357
02:09:23,747 --> 02:09:25,578
Signal's fading.

1358
02:09:25,667 --> 02:09:28,818
No! No, Bud, I'm not going away.
I'm right here.

1359
02:09:28,907 --> 02:09:32,695
Kill everything we don't need.
Knock out those exterior lights. Go! Go!

1360
02:09:32,787 --> 02:09:36,223
Run it through the digital processor!
Cook it as much as you can!

1361
02:09:36,307 --> 02:09:38,298
I am right here with you, Bud.

1362
02:09:38,387 --> 02:09:40,343
Bud, this is Lindsey.

1363
02:09:40,427 --> 02:09:43,385
Please. I'm right here with you.

1364
02:09:43,467 --> 02:09:47,142
OK? So try and stay calm.
I'm right here, all right?

1365
02:09:53,027 --> 02:09:54,016
Bud.

1366
02:09:56,627 --> 02:09:58,106
He's losing it.

1367
02:09:58,187 --> 02:10:01,782
- Talk to him. Keep him with us.
- Comin' up on 16,000 feet.

1368
02:10:01,867 --> 02:10:04,256
No, Bud, it's the pressure, all right?

1369
02:10:04,347 --> 02:10:07,100
You have to listen to my voice.
You have to try.

1370
02:10:07,187 --> 02:10:10,975
Concentrate, all right?
Just listen to my voice. Please.

1371
02:10:11,067 --> 02:10:13,183
17,000 feet.

1372
02:10:13,267 --> 02:10:15,701
Christ almighty, this is insane.

1373
02:10:15,787 --> 02:10:17,778
Bud? I'm not getting anything!

1374
02:10:23,507 --> 02:10:25,862
- Whoa! Come on! No!
- What?

1375
02:10:25,947 --> 02:10:28,097
- Little Geekjust folded.
- Jesus.

1376
02:11:16,663 --> 02:11:18,619
He can still make it.

1377
02:11:20,103 --> 02:11:22,094
OK.

1378
02:11:23,743 --> 02:11:25,859
Bud?

1379
02:11:25,943 --> 02:11:27,934
I know how alone you feel.

1380
02:11:30,223 --> 02:11:33,738
Alone in all that... cold... blackness.

1381
02:11:37,783 --> 02:11:41,492
But I'm there in the dark with you.
Oh, Bud. You're not alone.

1382
02:11:45,583 --> 02:11:47,574
Oh, God!

1383
02:11:47,663 --> 02:11:49,654
You remember that time...

1384
02:11:49,743 --> 02:11:53,133
You were pretty drunk.
You probably don't remember.

1385
02:11:53,223 --> 02:11:57,421
The power went out in that little apartment
we had on Orange Street.

1386
02:11:58,183 --> 02:12:03,177
We were staring at that one little candle
and I said something really dumb like...

1387
02:12:03,263 --> 02:12:05,254
..."That candle is me, like...

1388
02:12:06,143 --> 02:12:10,580
like every one of us is out there
alone in the dark in this life."

1389
02:12:12,423 --> 02:12:17,133
And you just... you just lit up another candle
and you put it beside mine,

1390
02:12:17,223 --> 02:12:20,135
and you said "No. See, that's me. That's me."

1391
02:12:21,263 --> 02:12:23,936
And we stared at the two candles and then...

1392
02:12:26,823 --> 02:12:31,135
Well, if you remember any of this,
I'm sure you remember the next part.

1393
02:12:34,023 --> 02:12:36,332
But there are two candles in the dark.

1394
02:12:38,463 --> 02:12:40,454
I'm with you.

1395
02:12:40,543 --> 02:12:43,296
I'll always be with you, Bud. I promise that.

1396
02:12:56,423 --> 02:12:58,414
How you doin', pardner?

1397
02:12:59,463 --> 02:13:01,454
You still with us? Come back.

1398
02:13:02,503 --> 02:13:04,494
You talk to us, Buddy boy.

1399
02:13:04,583 --> 02:13:06,574
- Come on.
- Bud?

1400
02:13:06,663 --> 02:13:08,654
Talk to me, Bud.

1401
02:13:08,743 --> 02:13:11,132
Now, come on. You hangin' in there?

1402
02:13:11,223 --> 02:13:14,181
You have to talk to me, Bud! Please!

1403
02:13:14,263 --> 02:13:16,982
I need to know if you're OK.

1404
02:13:30,303 --> 02:13:32,498
You... you see light?

1405
02:13:32,583 --> 02:13:34,141
What kind of light, Bud?

1406
02:13:36,063 --> 02:13:38,293
He's hallucinating badly.

1407
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:02,730
- He made it.
- Oh, my God.

1408
02:14:05,620 --> 02:14:07,019
OK, Bud.

1409
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:09,091
We'll go step by step.

1410
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:13,617
Remove the detonator housing
by unscrewing it

1411
02:14:13,700 --> 02:14:15,691
counterclockwise.

1412
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:47,452
All right, Bud. You have to cut

1413
02:14:47,540 --> 02:14:50,612
the ground wire. Not the lead wire.

1414
02:14:50,700 --> 02:14:53,214
It's the blue wire with the white stripe.

1415
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:56,815
Not, I repeat,

1416
02:14:56,900 --> 02:14:59,414
not the black wire with the yellow stripe.

1417
02:15:53,780 --> 02:15:55,771
Quiet! Save your air.

1418
02:15:55,860 --> 02:15:58,454
Bud, give me a reading
off your liquid oxygen gauge.

1419
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:07,019
What?

1420
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:11,418
- It took him 30 minutes to get there!
- Bud! Do you hear me?

1421
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:13,570
You drop your weights and start back now!

1422
02:16:13,660 --> 02:16:16,618
That gauge could be wrong. Do you hear me?

1423
02:16:16,700 --> 02:16:20,932
Just drop your weights and start back now!
Your gauge could be wrong!

1424
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:25,377
Your gauge could be wrong!
You drop your weights and start back now!

1425
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:33,816
You won't stay there. You drop your weights.
You can breathe shallow! Do you hear me?

1426
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:36,494
Bud, please listen to me! Please! Goddamn it!

1427
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:39,094
You dragged me back
from that bottomless pit!

1428
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:42,411
You can't leave me here alone now. Please!

1429
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:44,809
Oh, God, Virgil! Please!

1430
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:47,255
Please!

1431
02:17:26,220 --> 02:17:28,211
I love you.

1432
02:22:21,418 --> 02:22:23,409
Howdy.

1433
02:22:23,498 --> 02:22:26,376
How are you guys doin'?

1434
02:22:31,578 --> 02:22:35,856
Attempts to convene a summit
between heads of state have collapsed...

1435
02:22:35,938 --> 02:22:38,930
The Soviet build-up of tanks and aircraft has...

1436
02:22:39,018 --> 02:22:43,136
All citizens to stay on their jobs,
restrict unnecessary travel...

1437
02:22:43,218 --> 02:22:45,732
...what officials are calling
an unprovoked attack.

1438
02:22:45,818 --> 02:22:46,807
Oh, shit!

1439
02:22:46,898 --> 02:22:50,129
Across the country,
National Guard units have been mobilised

1440
02:22:50,218 --> 02:22:53,733
and all civil defence volunteers
have been called to full-time duty.

1441
02:22:56,258 --> 02:22:59,250
You watch our TV.
That's what you're telling me.

1442
02:22:59,338 --> 02:23:02,774
- You know what's going on up there.
- Seismologists are reporting

1443
02:23:02,858 --> 02:23:06,055
an enormous disturbance
throughout the world's oceans

1444
02:23:06,138 --> 02:23:08,527
which apparently began
about 15 minutes ago.

1445
02:23:08,618 --> 02:23:13,248
They are acoustic shock waves like tsunamis,
but with no apparent seismological source.

1446
02:23:13,338 --> 02:23:16,933
The waves are propagating towards
the shorelines of every continent.

1447
02:23:17,018 --> 02:23:19,657
- I'm sorry. That's...
- Dr Berg, would you please...

1448
02:23:19,738 --> 02:23:21,854
Young lady. Young lady, listen to me.

1449
02:23:21,938 --> 02:23:25,294
I don't know. We don't know
what's going on yet. We don't have a clue.

1450
02:23:26,578 --> 02:23:28,808
The horizon has already grown dark.

1451
02:23:28,898 --> 02:23:32,015
People are running everywhere.
It's sheer panic.

1452
02:23:32,098 --> 02:23:33,451
Stay on me!

1453
02:23:33,538 --> 02:23:37,577
The wave... the wave is,
I don't know, maybe 1,000 feet high already.

1454
02:23:37,658 --> 02:23:39,649
Getting bigger as I'm watching,

1455
02:23:39,738 --> 02:23:41,729
still miles out.

1456
02:23:41,818 --> 02:23:43,649
- My God!
- Get outta here!

1457
02:23:43,738 --> 02:23:45,456
No! Stay! We're staying!

1458
02:23:45,538 --> 02:23:46,971
Give it to me, then!

1459
02:23:47,058 --> 02:23:50,528
I don't even know if I'm still broadcasting.
I can't be sure.

1460
02:23:50,618 --> 02:23:52,848
I'll just keep going as long as I can.

1461
02:23:57,458 --> 02:23:59,449
You guys are doing this.

1462
02:24:01,418 --> 02:24:04,774
You guys are doing this, right?
You can control water.

1463
02:24:04,858 --> 02:24:08,055
That's your technology,
but why are you doing this?

1464
02:24:27,338 --> 02:24:31,331
OK. That's enough. I get the point!

1465
02:24:31,418 --> 02:24:33,409
How do you know

1466
02:24:33,498 --> 02:24:35,489
they're really gonna do it?

1467
02:24:36,738 --> 02:24:40,572
Where do you get off passing judgement
on us? You can't be sure.

1468
02:24:40,658 --> 02:24:42,535
How do you know?

1469
02:27:30,418 --> 02:27:32,409
You could've done it.

1470
02:27:34,698 --> 02:27:36,689
Why didn't you?

1471
02:28:52,258 --> 02:28:55,295
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

1472
02:28:55,378 --> 02:28:57,812
Do you hear, Deepcore?

1473
02:28:57,898 --> 02:29:01,015
Deepcore, do you read?
Do you read me, Deepcore?

1474
02:29:03,775 --> 02:29:07,211
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

1475
02:29:08,895 --> 02:29:11,170
Hell, yes, we read! Good of you to join us!

1476
02:29:11,255 --> 02:29:13,405
Copy, Deepcore. Hey, I've got 'em!

1477
02:29:14,055 --> 02:29:16,046
How's that storm goin' up there?

1478
02:29:16,135 --> 02:29:18,251
It just blew itself out all of a sudden.

1479
02:29:18,335 --> 02:29:21,566
Well, hell, son.
You'd better get a line down to us.

1480
02:29:21,655 --> 02:29:25,887
We're in moderately poor shape down here.
We've lost seven people, including Bud.

1481
02:29:25,975 --> 02:29:28,773
And we're about out of O2,
so whatever you're gonna do...

1482
02:29:31,293 --> 02:29:33,761
You make up your mind
how to get us outta here?

1483
02:29:33,853 --> 02:29:35,684
They're talking about
flying in a DSRV from Norfolk.

1484
02:29:36,771 --> 02:29:38,887
- I just wish I could've seen it.
- OK.

1485
02:29:38,971 --> 02:29:40,962
How long's that gonna take?

1486
02:29:41,051 --> 02:29:43,884
How do you stop
a half-mile-high tidal wave...

1487
02:29:48,491 --> 02:29:50,766
Hey...

1488
02:29:50,851 --> 02:29:53,319
- Hey! It's Bud!
- That's impossible.

1489
02:29:54,891 --> 02:29:58,122
- No, it's not.
- Do you hear, Deepcore?

1490
02:29:58,211 --> 02:29:59,803
Yes!

1491
02:29:59,891 --> 02:30:02,530
Wait. We've got a message from Bud.

1492
02:30:02,611 --> 02:30:05,330
- Bud?
- What's it say?

1493
02:30:06,371 --> 02:30:08,362
Here.

1494
02:30:08,451 --> 02:30:10,442
It says...

1495
02:30:11,571 --> 02:30:14,881
It says "Virgil Brigman back on the air."

1496
02:30:27,211 --> 02:30:30,009
"Have some new friends down here."

1497
02:30:30,091 --> 02:30:32,446
"Guess they've been here a while."

1498
02:30:41,451 --> 02:30:45,729
"They've left us alone, but it bothers them
to see us hurting each other."

1499
02:30:49,571 --> 02:30:52,085
"Getting out of hand."

1500
02:30:59,211 --> 02:31:02,009
"They sent a message. Hope you got it."

1501
02:31:02,091 --> 02:31:05,049
I'd say that's a big ten-four, Jack.

1502
02:31:05,131 --> 02:31:07,804
"They want us to grow up a bit

1503
02:31:07,891 --> 02:31:10,325
and put away childish things."

1504
02:31:12,011 --> 02:31:15,640
"Of course, it's just a suggestion."

1505
02:31:23,371 --> 02:31:26,124
Looks like you boys
might be out of business.

1506
02:31:35,651 --> 02:31:37,642
What the hell's goin' on?

1507
02:31:37,731 --> 02:31:40,040
One Night, get to sonar.

1508
02:31:40,131 --> 02:31:41,644
Good God almighty!

1509
02:31:43,291 --> 02:31:46,840
Fellas...
I'm gettin' some awful big readings here.

1510
02:31:46,931 --> 02:31:49,570
- Something's comin' up the wall!
- What is it?

1511
02:31:49,651 --> 02:31:51,642
Whatever it is, it's major!

1512
02:32:21,571 --> 02:32:23,289
Something is definitely going on down there.

1513
02:32:25,291 --> 02:32:28,806
Active is pinging back something really big.
It's huge!

1514
02:32:28,891 --> 02:32:31,166
- It's coming up underneath us.
- Where?

1515
02:32:31,251 --> 02:32:34,209
Where? It's everywhere!
There! Starboard bow!

1516
02:33:54,011 --> 02:33:55,683
There! Look!

1517
02:34:08,647 --> 02:34:10,638
Help, Cat!

1518
02:34:39,607 --> 02:34:42,963
We should be dead. We didn't decompress.

1519
02:34:45,487 --> 02:34:47,717
They must have done something to us.

1520
02:34:49,367 --> 02:34:51,642
Oh, yeah.

1521
02:34:51,727 --> 02:34:53,718
Yeah, I think you could say that.

1522
02:35:41,247 --> 02:35:43,238
Hi, Brigman.

1523
02:35:44,407 --> 02:35:46,398
Hi, Mrs Brigman.
