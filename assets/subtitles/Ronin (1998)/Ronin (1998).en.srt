1
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:33,249
Une bière, s'il vous plaît.

2
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:54,562
Merci.

3
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,501
We are closed.

4
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:42,336
Just a small drink.

5
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:51,095
The toilets?

6
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:47,777
A quick drink and then l'll leave.

7
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,698
Why are you rushing off?

8
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:55,993
- Hmm?
- l said, why are you rushing off?

9
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:57,787
l don't understand.

10
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,040
The man from Bristol called ya.

11
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:09,381
- What man?
- The man in the wheelchair.

12
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:48,504
What were you doing back here?

13
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:51,507
Lady,

14
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,177
l never walk into a place
l don't know how to walk out of.

15
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:58,264
Then why would you get into that van?

16
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,808
You know the reason.

17
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:14,048
Make yourselves at home.

18
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:16,675
You've come a long way.

19
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,762
- Thanks for coming.
- What's the job?

20
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:23,641
There's some people
who have something we require.

21
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:27,186
- And we want you to get it from them.
- lt involves shooting?

22
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:30,856
You must be tired.

23
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:33,150
We'll tell you more tomorrow.

24
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:43,994
Seven fat years
and seven lean years.

25
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:46,914
- That's what it says in the Bible.
- You ever kill anybody?

26
00:08:46,997 --> 00:08:49,583
l hurt somebody's feelings once.

27
00:08:56,132 --> 00:08:57,883
Don't l know you?

28
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:03,389
l don't think so. l'd remember.

29
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,440
Okay, two-hour shifts.

30
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,276
l'll watch the front,
you guys watch the back.

31
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:19,113
Merci.

32
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,836
You awake, then?

33
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:38,215
Hmm?

34
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,636
How we doin'?

35
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:48,851
Yep.

36
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:08,996
You labour or management?

37
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:13,250
lf l was management,
l wouldn't have given you a cigarette.

38
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:18,964
l am the tour guide.
Over there is the Eiffel Tower.

39
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:21,842
Over here, the Louvre.
Over there, les toilettes.

40
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:24,303
What do l call you?

41
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:27,098
- My name is Vincent.
- Sam.

42
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:35,064
As per the agreement,
your salary will be $5,000 a week

43
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:37,817
with a minimum
of four weeks' work.

44
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:40,319
On the successful completion
of the mission,

45
00:10:40,444 --> 00:10:44,281
you will each receive
a bonus of $20,000.

46
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:49,870
And by the way,
my name is Deirdre.

47
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:52,915
- The broad outlines of the mission are...
- Who are your principals?

48
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,875
For you,
there's no one but myself.

49
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:57,002
Huh?

50
00:10:57,086 --> 00:11:00,089
And what can we infer
from your charming lrish lilt?

51
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:03,300
- Anything you like.
- Where's the equipment?

52
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:05,928
Tell me what you need, make a list,
and give it to Vincent.

53
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:09,306
- Some of the equipment's quite technical.
- lf it's in Paris, l'll find it.

54
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,852
This is what we're after.

55
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:16,939
We need to take it intact from several
men who'll be intent on preventing us.

56
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:19,358
- How many men?
- You American?

57
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:23,320
l think the group will be between
five and eight. No more than eight.

58
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:27,992
- You don't know for sure?
- Not now but l will know before the event.

59
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:31,620
lf you don't know,
why say between five and eight?

60
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:33,622
There's two to three cars.
The group's travellin'.

61
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:35,082
- They're not in Paris?
- No.

62
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,083
Where are they?

63
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,794
- You'll find out soon enough.
- What's in the case?

64
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:43,424
Our plan, in broad strokes, is an ambush.

65
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:46,135
lt's to hit the car,
to take them in transit.

66
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,014
- Transit? City? Country?
- Right now, as l said, l don't know.

67
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:52,475
But we've to move very quickly.

68
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,062
We'll start with this: Ambush
and assault on two to three vehicles,

69
00:11:57,146 --> 00:12:01,817
five to eight men, and our objective
is the safe retrieval of this case.

70
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:05,613
Tell Vincent
what it is you'll need.

71
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:10,618
What do we know about them?
Are they French? Who are they?

72
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:13,996
All you need to know right now
is that they're very unpleasant.

73
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:18,751
- You've done this kind of thing before?
- You know...

74
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:19,919
How difficult can it be?

75
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:22,129
We have no idea
how these men will be armed?

76
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:24,715
lt seems they'll be
very well armed, indeed.

77
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,884
Where are we going and
how are we getting back from there?

78
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:30,137
lt'll be in France, and the group
will disband at the RV point.

79
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:33,891
- What does she mean?
- After that, we're on our own.

80
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:36,685
- lt's a military term.
- That's right.

81
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,312
Larry, tell Vincent what you'll need.

82
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:43,317
Something very fast. Audi S-8.
Something that can shove.

83
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:46,195
l'm going to have it for you
by the afternoon.

84
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,990
l'll also need a nitrous system.
l've got the specs.

85
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:57,081
What do you use, weapons-wise?

86
00:12:57,206 --> 00:12:59,416
- Hmm?
- Weapons.

87
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,586
- l'm a... l'm a weapons man.
- Weapons man.

88
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,588
- Yeah.
- Okay.

89
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:08,717
They tend to settle the argument.
So what do you favour?

90
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:12,430
Well, you know. lt's a toolbox.
You put the tools in for the job.

91
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:13,722
What?

92
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:16,934
You know,
l actually favour the old 1911.

93
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:20,438
.45. Old gun.

94
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:24,358
lt served my country well.
A long time.

95
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,902
Your country!

96
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:29,071
Not done too well, have you,
last few wars?

97
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:31,615
Perhaps not, but at least
we don't go around whining about it.

98
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:35,035
You ex-military?

99
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:37,121
No, l got my job
through the New York Times.

100
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:42,001
- Don't let him get you down.
- lt don't mean nothin' to me.

101
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:43,919
l say what l think.

102
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:46,464
Are you ex-military?

103
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:48,757
Boys at Hereford?

104
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:51,594
l'm sorry, but l'd like to go backwards.
The line of retreat is...

105
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:56,223
She just told you.
We meet back at the RV, disband.

106
00:13:56,348 --> 00:14:00,311
l understand. l'm just trying to get
a vague notion of the opposition.

107
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:06,066
We're gonna cause some animosity.
How many will be coming after us?

108
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:09,278
- You worried about your own skin?
- Yeah, l am.

109
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:11,238
lt covers my body.

110
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:16,035
All your concerns will be addressed
before we leave.

111
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,704
- Electronics and commo.
- Not more than three cars?

112
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:20,164
That is our information.

113
00:14:20,372 --> 00:14:23,042
- Can you get me a simulator?
- What's a simulator?

114
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,337
Gunpowder. Sound only, no lead.
Sounds like a pistol.

115
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,047
Quite diverting.

116
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,801
Listen, l'm also gonna need
some bigger injection jets.

117
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,512
The Bosch is not gonna do it.
They have to be custom-made.

118
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:37,598
We going north? We going south?

119
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:40,976
l'd like some new clothes.

120
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,687
- Vincent will sort you out.
- l'll take care of it.

121
00:14:50,611 --> 00:14:53,781
- So what brought you here?
- A fella that doesn't work so well.

122
00:14:55,116 --> 00:14:57,493
The man in the wheelchair?

123
00:14:58,369 --> 00:14:59,829
How did he get there?

124
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:04,792
That was in your neck of the woods,
back in the late unpleasantness.

125
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:17,430
Good reflexes.

126
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:20,766
Oh, yeah.

127
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,436
They die hard.

128
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:34,029
- lnterrogation.
- What?

129
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:38,200
- Methods to withstand interrogation.
- You've done that?

130
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:41,287
We were taught
to hold out indefinitely.

131
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,792
- Nobody can hold out indefinitely.
- Ah, is that so?

132
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:52,548
Everybody has a limit. l spent
some time in interrogation... once.

133
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:54,967
- They make it hard on you?
- They don't make it easy.

134
00:15:55,342 --> 00:15:59,430
Yeah, it was unpleasant.
l held out as long as l could.

135
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:02,183
All the stuff they tried.

136
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:04,643
You just can't hold out for ever.

137
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:07,438
- lmpossible.
- How'd they finally get to you?

138
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:10,274
- They gave me a grasshopper.
- What's a grasshopper?

139
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,945
That's two part gin, two part brandy,
one part crème de menthe...

140
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,114
Fuckin' smartass!

141
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,993
- Can you find this place?
- Of course.

142
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:23,037
l know it.

143
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:26,165
That's where
they wanna do the exchange.

144
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,125
You're gonna exchange for cash?

145
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:33,255
- You know these people?
- My people know them.

146
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,591
Your people have done business
with them before?

147
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:38,552
Or these people
just gave your people a number?

148
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:51,607
Larry.

149
00:16:55,277 --> 00:16:58,906
Okay. lf we're gonna do it,
let's do the goddamn thing right.

150
00:17:01,826 --> 00:17:04,620
- Hey!
- l'm busy.

151
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:08,165
Okay, come on. Let's go.

152
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,836
The answers to your questions
l'll know when l get back.

153
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,047
- l'll go with you.
- Go with them.

154
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,194
Who does this girl work for?

155
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:41,657
Well, she works for our betters.

156
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,910
lt seems that's what
we're meant to know.

157
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,713
Always a waiting game.

158
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:59,633
- What?
- lt's a waiting game.

159
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:05,389
Hey, wait.
Would you not do that, please?

160
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:10,603
Bad for the night vision, yeah?

161
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:19,069
There they are.

162
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:10,079
- You have the list?
- Yes, l have it.

163
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:11,914
Give it to me.

164
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:17,711
Money?

165
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:21,507
Okay. You follow my lead.

166
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:23,884
Just make sure you watch my back.

167
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:30,391
Don't make any sudden moves.

168
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:34,437
Just because we're buying guns
doesn't mean we didn't bring any.

169
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,773
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

170
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:43,028
You want to back him up?

171
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:49,118
What would l profit from your death?

172
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:52,705
- Well, you'd have the money.
- l have the money already.

173
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:57,042
l'll watch the back.

174
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:02,798
- Have you got it all?
- Oui.

175
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:08,012
- You're sure?
- Of course. Come and see.

176
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:19,315
There it is!

177
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:41,754
lt's not all here.

178
00:20:43,672 --> 00:20:45,883
- Vincent.
- What?

179
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:52,598
lt's not all here.

180
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:54,475
- C'est tout?
- Ah, non, non, non.

181
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:58,938
Le patron va contrôler l'argent.
Vous aurez le reste de la marchandise.

182
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:03,067
Tiens. ll est là dans la voiture,
avec le patron.

183
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:07,571
He said the rest is in the other car.
The boss wants to check the money.

184
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:10,908
If he agrees, we have no problem.

185
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:12,785
Here, take the car keys.

186
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,996
Go on. Take them.

187
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,627
Come on. Come.

188
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:25,965
Okay, give me...
Give me some of the money.

189
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:36,142
Give me some of the money!

190
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:40,438
- Okay.
- You aren't going in there?

191
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:44,692
- Yeah, l am, and so are you.
- Why am l going in there?

192
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:48,821
- Why? To protect me.
- There is no protection there.

193
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:52,366
lf it's a come-on, we're fish in a barrel.
Why do they want you in there?

194
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,910
- What are you, crazy?
- You know, you think too hard.

195
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:58,622
Nobody ever told me that before.
But l wouldn't go in there.

196
00:22:00,374 --> 00:22:03,878
- What is it, Sam?
- l don't like it. Look at it.

197
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:07,423
Okay, okay.

198
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:09,967
Okay, let's just do it.
Let's just do it and be done, yeah?

199
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:12,344
You don't wanna go in there.

200
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:17,808
- l'm getting paid to go. lt's that simple.
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

201
00:22:17,892 --> 00:22:21,520
lf anything goes down,
get next to one of those guys.

202
00:22:21,645 --> 00:22:23,773
lf there's a sniper,
he'll be afraid to shoot his own guy.

203
00:22:23,898 --> 00:22:25,608
- Let's go!
- All right.

204
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:49,673
Stop!

205
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:51,967
Stay where you are.

206
00:23:07,775 --> 00:23:10,444
So, everything's fine.

207
00:23:21,372 --> 00:23:23,415
Shit! l can't see! l can't see!

208
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:38,305
Have some of this!

209
00:23:42,977 --> 00:23:44,520
Fuckin' arsehole!

210
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,278
Fuckin' have some more, you bastards!

211
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:55,948
Come on! Come on!

212
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:59,743
Let's go!

213
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,165
- No! You goddamn...
- Come on! Let's go!

214
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:19,096
- ls anybody hurt?
- We're fine.

215
00:24:21,056 --> 00:24:25,853
Almost a bit of raspberry jam
back there, yeah?

216
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:27,855
A bit of raspberry jam back there!

217
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:35,279
Got the swag, kept the money.
Job well done.

218
00:24:35,362 --> 00:24:37,281
That's a fact. That is a fact.

219
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:03,891
Slow down. Slow down.

220
00:25:05,976 --> 00:25:08,187
l think l have to stop.

221
00:25:37,091 --> 00:25:37,925
Thank you.

222
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,397
Why did you take this job?

223
00:25:53,983 --> 00:25:56,026
My friend, l need the money.

224
00:25:57,153 --> 00:25:59,488
The money is here.

225
00:26:03,784 --> 00:26:06,954
That's what this is, you know? Money.

226
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,960
Yeah, but who are our employers?

227
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:17,506
You're right.

228
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:47,828
Excuse me.

229
00:26:47,995 --> 00:26:50,498
Excuse me, monsieur.

230
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,675
The Russians are bidding for the case.

231
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,805
The case is in Nice.
They're trying to sell it to the Russians.

232
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:09,183
They're staying at
the Villa Belle Mer in Nice.

233
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:14,814
- The team isn't ready.
- Whatever the team is, you do it now.

234
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:18,025
The Russians have decided to bid.
We need to move now.

235
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,194
Excuse me.

236
00:27:20,402 --> 00:27:23,864
l have the information.
We'll be movin' very soon.

237
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:25,908
lt'll definitely
be in the nature of an ambush

238
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:29,870
somewhere between here and here.

239
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:34,375
We'll anticipate
a three-car convoy with a backup team.

240
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:38,045
We will try and stop the target
before they can get away from us.

241
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,131
- What's in the case?
- That information isn't necessary.

242
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:42,216
ls it heavy? ls it explosive?

243
00:27:42,383 --> 00:27:44,343
ls it chained
to some unlucky bloke's wrist?

244
00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:46,512
- Are we gonna have to chop it off?
- All right.

245
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:48,806
l don't have to let you know...

246
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:52,309
Then the price has got to go up.

247
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:54,270
l'll get you the case,
but the price has gotta go up.

248
00:27:54,395 --> 00:27:57,148
lf it's gonna be amateur night,
l want $100,000. l want it up front.

249
00:27:57,231 --> 00:28:01,944
l want it in a bank account. l want
another $100,000 when you get the case.

250
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:37,188
Okay.

251
00:28:38,397 --> 00:28:42,568
We've got shooters here, shooters here.

252
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:44,528
l'll tell you an old trick.

253
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:45,362
Hey.

254
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,708
- What's your problem?
- Draw it again.

255
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:02,421
Draw it again.
You're the ace field man. Draw it again.

256
00:29:02,546 --> 00:29:06,175
lt's a simple diagram.
Just draw it again. Draw what you saw.

257
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:10,846
Draw it again! Draw it again.

258
00:29:14,016 --> 00:29:17,478
Two shooters.
Car comes through here.

259
00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:19,605
Shooters across from each other,
kill each other dead.

260
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,525
- Oh, my. Where'd you learn that?
- ln a regiment.

261
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:25,152
- What regiment was that?
- The 22nd Special Air Service.

262
00:29:25,236 --> 00:29:27,655
What's the colour
of the boathouse at Hereford?

263
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,366
What's the colour
of the boathouse at Hereford?

264
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:32,409
- l don't like your attitude.
- What's the colour of the boathouse...

265
00:29:32,535 --> 00:29:35,079
- Fuck off!
- What's... You got the gun. l'm unarmed.

266
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:38,165
Do something. Go ahead.
Do something. Do something.

267
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,209
Do something.

268
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:53,848
Tell me about an ambush?
Don't tell me about an ambush!

269
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:56,976
l ambushed you with a cup of coffee.

270
00:30:00,771 --> 00:30:03,107
You'll get your money
when we get the case.

271
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,985
- The others, too.
- That is what l understood.

272
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:07,945
Come on.
We've gotten the word. We're movin'.

273
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:17,246
Put this near the front.

274
00:30:18,831 --> 00:30:22,126
Careful! Careful with that!

275
00:30:33,387 --> 00:30:37,016
So what colour
is the boathouse at Hereford?

276
00:30:37,141 --> 00:30:39,059
How the fuck should l know?

277
00:31:01,457 --> 00:31:03,334
This'll complete your compensation.

278
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:09,840
Thanks for your time.
Feel free to leave when we're gone.

279
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:13,344
Do l need to suggest that you forget us?

280
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,766
Because we will not forget.

281
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:27,084
- Morning.
- l see you're reviewin' our problem.

282
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:29,754
Well, either you're part of the problem,
part of the solution,

283
00:32:29,837 --> 00:32:32,089
- or you're just part of the landscape.
- lndeed.

284
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:34,675
What's in the case?

285
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,137
Something we're paying ya for.

286
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:57,323
- You and the girl are in front of the hotel.
- The name's Deirdre.

287
00:32:57,448 --> 00:33:00,451
Deirdre.
Wait outside the hotel for the target.

288
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:02,995
He leaves the hotel for the villa,
the villa for the hotel.

289
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,288
He activates his cellphone.

290
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:06,207
How do you know
he's gonna use his cellphone?

291
00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:09,210
- He'll use a phone.
- How do you know?

292
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:11,712
- l'm gonna call him on it.
- How do you know he'll have it with him?

293
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:14,090
He's waitin' for a call.

294
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:18,427
His people will call him to tell him
the location of the meet.

295
00:33:18,552 --> 00:33:20,429
- Okay?
- Okay.

296
00:33:20,513 --> 00:33:23,849
The villa, the hotel, the car,
the stop light, 8 to 10 guys.

297
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:25,851
How good's their...
How good's their security?

298
00:33:25,935 --> 00:33:29,021
- l can't tell you.
- Well, let's find out. Where are they?

299
00:33:29,146 --> 00:33:31,023
The last report, they were at the hotel.

300
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,025
- The case is at the hotel?
- We presume that it is.

301
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:35,903
- That's interesting.
- Why don't we do it now?

302
00:33:35,986 --> 00:33:39,406
- lt's tempting.
- lt's a good plan. Let's stick to the plan.

303
00:33:39,532 --> 00:33:43,202
Everybody wants to go to the party.
Nobody wants to stay and clean up.

304
00:33:43,285 --> 00:33:45,704
- Please.
- The only thing is that the map...

305
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:48,499
The map is not the territory.

306
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,418
Let's go look at the ground.

307
00:33:51,544 --> 00:33:54,547
Bring some money.
We're gonna do a little shopping.

308
00:34:02,888 --> 00:34:04,640
Listen up.

309
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:08,686
You're my wife.
Be who you wanna look like.

310
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:11,981
lt's just a game. Just a game.

311
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:14,900
Man and a woman going for a walk.

312
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:18,612
Piece of cake.
Relax. Relax, darling.

313
00:34:20,322 --> 00:34:22,241
You look good cleaned up.

314
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:28,164
ls that the hotel?

315
00:34:43,804 --> 00:34:46,640
Put your arm under mine.
Put your arm under mine.

316
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:51,771
Why aren't they at the villa?
Why are they down here?

317
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:53,981
Fun and games?
Pretty girls and beer or what?

318
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,207
Can l help you, sir?

319
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:13,542
No. We're looking at the menu.

320
00:35:19,965 --> 00:35:21,383
Merci.

321
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:55,042
Uh, excuse me?
Do you speak English?

322
00:35:55,126 --> 00:35:55,626
A little.

323
00:35:55,751 --> 00:35:58,462
Could you take a picture
of me and my wife?

324
00:35:58,587 --> 00:36:01,298
lt's very easy. You press like that.

325
00:36:01,424 --> 00:36:04,802
- Sure.
- Like that. That's it. Focus like that.

326
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:06,804
Okay?

327
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:10,224
We're gonna do it over here.

328
00:36:13,185 --> 00:36:17,022
Can you get that palm tree in?
We wanna show we're on the Riviera.

329
00:36:18,858 --> 00:36:22,027
- How many do you want?
- Just snap away.

330
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:27,491
Very good. Again.

331
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:30,828
Again. Get the background.

332
00:36:32,455 --> 00:36:35,249
Take a couple of my wife, alone.

333
00:36:45,384 --> 00:36:48,929
Take my luggage up right away.

334
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:52,475
Thank you.

335
00:36:54,143 --> 00:36:57,938
Can we take one picture of you
with my wife? One picture with you?

336
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,940
That's it.

337
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,159
So?

338
00:37:10,284 --> 00:37:12,453
Well, they're good.

339
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:14,997
Guy goes for the case,
other guy's protecting the principal.

340
00:37:15,164 --> 00:37:16,999
Nobody panics. They're good.

341
00:37:17,124 --> 00:37:20,544
- So what have we learned?
- Can it be done?

342
00:37:20,628 --> 00:37:23,214
lt can be done.
We should have two more men.

343
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:26,092
- We don't have two more men.
- Go to your handler.

344
00:37:26,175 --> 00:37:28,052
- There is no handler.
- Let me go.

345
00:37:28,177 --> 00:37:30,346
There's no handler.
There's only me.

346
00:37:30,471 --> 00:37:33,557
Listen, you want the case,
we're gonna need some more men.

347
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:36,811
There's no more help,
there's no more men. Are you afraid?

348
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:39,313
Of course l'm afraid. You think
l'm reluctant because l'm happy?

349
00:37:39,396 --> 00:37:42,733
We've made a good plan,
and we're gonna stick with it.

350
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,615
What do we do?

351
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,118
We wait.

352
00:37:53,077 --> 00:37:57,790
- So, who are they?
- Our employers.

353
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:05,256
- Qui est là?
- lt's me.

354
00:38:06,382 --> 00:38:08,843
They've gone back to the villa.

355
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:11,220
- Did they have the case with them?
- They did.

356
00:38:11,345 --> 00:38:13,139
- Did you get the other cars?
- Got 'em.

357
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:16,058
- And how do they run?
- They'll do fine.

358
00:38:19,854 --> 00:38:21,730
Yeah.

359
00:38:23,482 --> 00:38:25,443
Well, what does that mean?

360
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,072
lt would be nice to do something.

361
00:38:30,197 --> 00:38:32,700
We are doing something.
We're sitting here, waiting.

362
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:44,128
lt's not gonna happen today.

363
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:46,630
The buyers are out of town.

364
00:38:46,756 --> 00:38:49,091
Tomorrow at the earliest.

365
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:55,431
You know what?
The hell with 'em. Let's go put 'em to bed.

366
00:38:55,598 --> 00:38:58,309
- We've got the report.
- lf l take the report, l got nothing else.

367
00:38:58,434 --> 00:39:01,312
l can go see for myself.
They at the villa?

368
00:39:01,395 --> 00:39:04,774
l'm gonna go take one last run
over the route and tuck 'em in.

369
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:14,158
l'll come with ya.

370
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:50,236
So how did you get started
in this business?

371
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:56,200
A wealthy scoundrel
seduced and betrayed me.

372
00:39:57,535 --> 00:39:59,912
Same with me. How 'bout that?

373
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,625
Take out the map. Take out the map.
lf anybody looks, we're...

374
00:40:20,724 --> 00:40:22,977
So who are those guys inside?

375
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:25,813
You tell me.

376
00:40:25,896 --> 00:40:30,443
Ex-military, Northern Sov Block,
somebody or other.

377
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:34,864
- They need a job. That's my excuse.
- ls it?

378
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:38,742
Cops.

379
00:41:19,658 --> 00:41:22,286
System activated.

380
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,791
System check.

381
00:41:29,293 --> 00:41:31,420
Repeat system check.

382
00:41:37,468 --> 00:41:40,679
There he is. He's being good.
He's activated his phone.

383
00:42:00,783 --> 00:42:02,868
l'm in position.

384
00:42:39,238 --> 00:42:42,950
- They're passin' me now.
- Target is on the way.

385
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:28,746
Hell of a time to be workin'.

386
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:30,748
What do you want for Christmas?

387
00:43:30,915 --> 00:43:33,542
My two front teeth.

388
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:35,836
May your wish be granted.

389
00:44:10,162 --> 00:44:13,707
Target is 400 metres
from the traffic light.

390
00:45:15,186 --> 00:45:16,687
Come on! Come on!

391
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:44,298
So far so good.
Target on the right road.

392
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:50,304
Sam, escort car.

393
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:53,307
- Four tenths of a click in front of you.
- Got it.

394
00:46:22,253 --> 00:46:25,923
Larry, you should see them in...
four seconds.

395
00:46:26,132 --> 00:46:27,800
Two cars.

396
00:46:29,176 --> 00:46:30,219
l got 'em.

397
00:47:13,053 --> 00:47:16,098
Target has escaped.
l repeat, target has gotten away.

398
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:00,017
Target heading for Vieux Nice.

399
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:09,003
Through the market, then straight.

400
00:49:17,511 --> 00:49:19,388
Right at the fork, Maréchal Foch.

401
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,232
Okay, you're in front of him.

402
00:49:38,866 --> 00:49:42,620
- Cut him off at the end of the port.
- Roger that. l got it.

403
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,541
He's coming from the right.

404
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:49,710
He's yours.

405
00:50:49,437 --> 00:50:51,981
- l'm hit! Take the case!
- Up the other end!

406
00:50:52,064 --> 00:50:55,025
- Get the fucking case!
- Get the car up the other end!

407
00:50:55,151 --> 00:50:56,068
Take this!

408
00:50:57,403 --> 00:50:59,905
Get out of here!
l'll see you at the safe house!

409
00:51:04,368 --> 00:51:07,872
Hey! Get rid of the case!
Get rid of the case!

410
00:51:20,634 --> 00:51:22,386
Arrêtez-vous!

411
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:25,306
- Where is Gregor?
- Gregor fucked us.

412
00:52:49,348 --> 00:52:51,267
- How is it out there?
- A lot of heat. A lot of heat.

413
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,394
- How you feeling?
- Okay.

414
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:56,397
- Thanks for before.
- Don't mention it.

415
00:52:58,107 --> 00:53:01,360
Could you clean the paint off this?

416
00:53:01,485 --> 00:53:04,572
- You got a pack of Camels in there?
- No, you smoke too much.

417
00:53:19,503 --> 00:53:21,338
We must get out ofhere.

418
00:53:22,631 --> 00:53:25,176
l'm gonna need your people to help us.

419
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:28,220
- And l need you to find the case.
- All right, call your guy.

420
00:53:28,345 --> 00:53:30,765
When we bring in the case, he'll help you.

421
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:33,768
- How can l bring him the case?
- Well, Gregor has it.

422
00:53:35,144 --> 00:53:38,105
- Why?
- l presume to sell it to the Russians.

423
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:40,649
Why the Russians? Why not you?

424
00:53:40,775 --> 00:53:41,984
lf we had the money to buy the case,

425
00:53:42,067 --> 00:53:44,737
we wouldn't have
hired you to steal it, would we?

426
00:53:44,987 --> 00:53:47,573
- Go to your people. Talk to them.
- You want the case?

427
00:53:47,656 --> 00:53:49,575
We find Gregor, we find the case.

428
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,745
- How do we find Gregor?
- How'd you find him in the first place?

429
00:53:52,828 --> 00:53:55,081
l found him
through your friend, the cripple,

430
00:53:55,164 --> 00:53:57,416
who gave me nothin'
but a bunch of fucking lames!

431
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,837
You and Spence
and the whole sorry lot of you!

432
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:03,839
We can find him through his cellphone.

433
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,845
Can we trace his cellphone?

434
00:54:12,973 --> 00:54:16,185
They can triangulate it,
if we had that equipment.

435
00:54:16,268 --> 00:54:17,853
Who has that equipment?

436
00:54:20,564 --> 00:54:23,943
Who has that equipment?

437
00:54:25,402 --> 00:54:27,279
Tell me.

438
00:54:28,447 --> 00:54:30,324
Who has it?

439
00:54:30,407 --> 00:54:33,327
All right. All right.

440
00:54:33,452 --> 00:54:35,621
Give me the number to his phone.

441
00:55:17,455 --> 00:55:20,374
So, how does the day find you?

442
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:24,420
How do they say it in French?
En pleine forme.

443
00:55:38,184 --> 00:55:40,603
This was supposed to be
a social occasion.

444
00:55:40,686 --> 00:55:44,315
- Life is uncertain.
- lt is indeed.

445
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,443
But, Gregor,
we have so much history together,

446
00:55:47,568 --> 00:55:50,029
l was sure you wouldn't mind.

447
00:55:50,196 --> 00:55:53,783
- Besides, the world these days is so...
- Unsafe?

448
00:55:54,992 --> 00:55:56,076
Exactly.

449
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,997
l'll show you how unsafe it is.

450
00:56:22,728 --> 00:56:25,648
See that little girl down there?

451
00:56:30,736 --> 00:56:34,156
Have you lost your mind?
Why did you do that?

452
00:56:34,281 --> 00:56:36,534
To make a point.

453
00:56:39,412 --> 00:56:42,456
l don't know her,
but l was ready to blow her brains out.

454
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,877
But you,
l don't particularly like you.

455
00:56:47,002 --> 00:56:50,840
Just imagine what l'll do to you if you
try anything. Now give me my money.

456
00:57:07,064 --> 00:57:08,858
Put down the gun.

457
00:57:14,113 --> 00:57:18,117
- l never liked you either, Gregor.
- Where did that come from?

458
00:57:21,078 --> 00:57:22,997
l should have made you strip.

459
00:57:23,164 --> 00:57:25,875
- Now where's my package?
- lt's right behind you.

460
00:57:55,863 --> 00:57:57,323
Whoo-hoo!

461
00:57:57,448 --> 00:58:00,159
Clever girl.

462
00:58:00,242 --> 00:58:01,452
You liked it?

463
00:58:01,577 --> 00:58:03,871
My little sun.

464
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:08,250
You make me so happy.

465
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:18,010
ls it done?

466
00:58:19,637 --> 00:58:21,514
lt's done, Mikhi.

467
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:25,434
Natacha?

468
00:58:25,518 --> 00:58:28,104
Gregor? ls that you, Gregor?

469
00:58:28,187 --> 00:58:30,147
Much to your disappointment,
no doubt.

470
00:58:30,231 --> 00:58:34,110
lt was a mistake.
lt should not have happened.

471
00:58:34,193 --> 00:58:37,363
Well, if it happens again,
l'll turn around and sell it to the lrish.

472
00:58:37,446 --> 00:58:40,741
- Don't do that.
- Then don't make me.

473
00:58:40,866 --> 00:58:42,701
My price just went up 300%.

474
00:58:44,537 --> 00:58:48,666
l want the package, Gregor.
What do l have to do to get it?

475
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,709
Just wait for my next phone call.

476
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:53,254
l'll find a place
where l can tilt the field in my favour.

477
00:59:37,548 --> 00:59:40,301
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

478
00:59:40,426 --> 00:59:42,636
Could you tell me
how to find a post office?

479
00:59:42,762 --> 00:59:46,015
Do... Do l know you?
l'm sorry. Do l know you?

480
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,434
How did you know l speak English?

481
00:59:48,517 --> 00:59:50,936
You got an English newspaper.

482
00:59:51,061 --> 00:59:52,980
Sorry.

483
00:59:53,063 --> 00:59:55,107
- l'm sorry. l beg your pardon.
- lt's all right.

484
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,777
Uh, what do you need
a post office for?

485
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,696
'Cause over here,
they use them for different things.

486
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,697
l need your help.

487
01:00:03,365 --> 01:00:05,242
- l thought you left.
- l did leave.

488
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:07,578
- You did leave? You're out?
- That's right.

489
01:00:07,661 --> 01:00:10,039
Can you help me? l need your help.

490
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,918
What's the number?

491
01:00:18,297 --> 01:00:21,175
Yeah, the post office is, uh,
just down to your left.

492
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,052
- Up on the left? Thanks.
- On the left.

493
01:00:31,018 --> 01:00:34,855
- A friend of yours?
- We went to high school together.

494
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:38,234
Everyone's your brother
until the rent comes due.

495
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:39,944
Ain't that the truth!

496
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,530
Yes. Yes, on the terrace?

497
01:00:42,947 --> 01:00:44,365
Facing me? l see him.

498
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,576
Yes, l'll get him. Hang on, please.

499
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:53,499
Excuse me, sir. Are you Sam?

500
01:00:56,502 --> 01:00:57,336
Yeah.

501
01:00:57,461 --> 01:00:58,921
Telephone for you.

502
01:01:07,763 --> 01:01:09,682
Yeah, good to see you, too.

503
01:01:09,807 --> 01:01:12,685
lf his position changes, l'll let you know.

504
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:21,402
Gregor's in a town called Arles.

505
01:02:37,478 --> 01:02:39,897
He's at the arena.

506
01:03:12,304 --> 01:03:15,307
So this is the amphitheatre of Arles

507
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:19,437
which was built
at the end of the first century AD.

508
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,939
lt is built with limestone.

509
01:03:29,447 --> 01:03:30,739
l know those men.

510
01:04:03,022 --> 01:04:06,066
And you can see
this dominant yellow colour

511
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,694
which is actually caused
essentially by a lantern.

512
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:11,530
We're not sure that the walls
were actually yellow.

513
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,532
And so, now we will continue

514
01:04:13,657 --> 01:04:16,285
and visit the Roman baths
down this way.

515
01:04:29,924 --> 01:04:31,801
Yeah.

516
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,224
Thank you, gentlemen.
That'll do nicely.

517
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,019
lt's Sergi. l remember you.

518
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:44,897
Yes, Gregor, it's me.

519
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:48,734
- How have you been?
- Well. These are trying times.

520
01:04:48,901 --> 01:04:51,987
- l'm sorry about the unfortunate incident.
- Oh, yeah.

521
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:55,574
lt was excessive.
And more to the point, it was foolish.

522
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:58,411
l couldn't agree with you more.

523
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:00,788
Mikhi did it without consulting me.

524
01:05:02,415 --> 01:05:05,167
Yeah, he's turned rogue
and can't be controlled, is that it?

525
01:05:18,139 --> 01:05:20,891
Excusez-moi.
Je cherche la vieille maison de Van Gogh.

526
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:24,103
- l don't... l don't...
- Oh, English.

527
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:26,105
Sorry. Such a fool.

528
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:28,107
l was looking for Van Gogh's old house.

529
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:32,611
So what could have been conducted
in a collegial atmosphere

530
01:05:32,736 --> 01:05:34,822
is now fucked into a cocked hat.

531
01:05:34,905 --> 01:05:38,868
- What do you think?
- l think we'll meet your price.

532
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:44,623
Yeah. Yes, so let's see it. Let's see it now.

533
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:46,167
Where do you have it, in your belt?

534
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:48,961
- Let's see it!
- Show me the case first.

535
01:05:51,255 --> 01:05:54,425
You're great in the locker room,
and your reflexes might die hard,

536
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,427
but you're weak
when you put your spikes on.

537
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:01,974
- Gregor? Are you all right?
- Gregor's fine.

538
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:04,810
But l think you're in a wee spot of trouble.

539
01:06:05,936 --> 01:06:08,731
- Where is it? Where is it?
- l don't have it with me.

540
01:06:08,814 --> 01:06:09,815
Where?

541
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:12,401
l mailed it to myself.
A post-office box in Paris.

542
01:06:12,485 --> 01:06:13,527
Hilfe!

543
01:06:13,611 --> 01:06:15,279
Help! He's robbing me!

544
01:06:54,485 --> 01:06:56,529
Pardon. Pardon.

545
01:06:56,654 --> 01:06:58,447
Pardon. Avancez!

546
01:06:58,572 --> 01:06:59,407
Pardon.

547
01:08:03,888 --> 01:08:04,722
Stop.

548
01:08:08,476 --> 01:08:11,145
- Where do l know you from?
- Vienna.

549
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:14,899
Of course. l'm sorry to have to do this.

550
01:08:14,982 --> 01:08:16,025
Hey!

551
01:08:34,335 --> 01:08:36,087
- Christ.
- Drive.

552
01:08:58,192 --> 01:09:03,322
Stop! Descends! Vite! Descends!

553
01:09:20,506 --> 01:09:27,763
- l'm gonna have to take care of this.
- What do you want to do?

554
01:09:27,888 --> 01:09:31,642
Uh, get to a doctor
or a veterinarian's office.

555
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:34,061
l'll just boost what l need.

556
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:41,485
- Could you do that?
- Of course. l can do better.

557
01:09:44,196 --> 01:09:46,449
- How is it?
- l'm leakin'.

558
01:09:47,825 --> 01:09:49,535
l'm sorry.

559
01:09:54,165 --> 01:09:56,041
That girl sold us out.

560
01:10:00,713 --> 01:10:03,591
She sold us out.

561
01:10:55,142 --> 01:10:58,104
- Ready, Jean-Pierre?
- Everything's ready.

562
01:11:17,456 --> 01:11:19,417
Get my legs up.

563
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:21,419
Careful.

564
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:33,222
Are you sure you can do this?

565
01:11:33,347 --> 01:11:36,892
Yeah. l once removed a guy's appendix
with a grapefruit spoon.

566
01:11:37,017 --> 01:11:40,312
- Have a drink.
- No booze. No.

567
01:11:46,026 --> 01:11:50,990
Easy, easy, easy.

568
01:11:57,037 --> 01:12:00,875
lt's just below the surface.

569
01:12:02,334 --> 01:12:05,504
All right, let's do it.
Just douse it with alcohol.

570
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:11,469
Take the gauze and wipe away
as much of the blood as you can.

571
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:13,763
Keep it clean so l can see it.

572
01:12:18,225 --> 01:12:20,144
Yeah. That's it.

573
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,111
All right.
What we're gonna do is routine.

574
01:12:29,236 --> 01:12:31,739
l've done this many times before.

575
01:12:31,864 --> 01:12:34,033
There are no vital organs, arteries.
lt's okay.

576
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,285
You won't kill me.
Just make sure you get the bullet

577
01:12:36,368 --> 01:12:38,454
- before you pry it out.
- All right.

578
01:12:38,579 --> 01:12:40,456
Take that scalpel.

579
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,879
The upper part.

580
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:50,466
Over here. Just cut up there.

581
01:12:50,549 --> 01:12:52,426
Just a little cut.

582
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:05,272
Okay. Got it.

583
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,026
Now take the clamp.

584
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,862
Take the clamp and open up... the hole.

585
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:14,532
Just put it in there.

586
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:17,535
Put it in there.

587
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:19,537
That's it. Put it in. Just...

588
01:13:19,703 --> 01:13:21,914
Now open it up. Spread it. Spread it.

589
01:13:22,039 --> 01:13:24,417
Okay. Okay.

590
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,586
Now get the other...
Get the other clamps and get the bullet.

591
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,713
Remember, don't take it out
unless you really got it.

592
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:51,485
Do it again. Do it again.
Just try once more.

593
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:01,287
l'm sorry.

594
01:14:03,247 --> 01:14:07,126
When he pulls it out, put the gauze in.
There's gonna be a lot of blood.

595
01:14:12,798 --> 01:14:14,675
Put the gauze there.

596
01:14:24,685 --> 01:14:27,021
Fucker sprayed his bullet with Teflon.

597
01:14:28,355 --> 01:14:32,193
He was trying to stamp me ''paid in full''.

598
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:35,154
- ls that why it went through the vest?
- Yeah.

599
01:14:36,947 --> 01:14:39,700
You think you can stitch me up
on your own?

600
01:14:41,077 --> 01:14:44,705
lf you don't mind,
l'm gonna pass out.

601
01:15:34,338 --> 01:15:36,841
You gonna kill me?

602
01:15:36,924 --> 01:15:40,845
No. l'm not gonna kill ya.

603
01:16:08,414 --> 01:16:10,291
Why would l want to kill ya?

604
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:32,480
- l gave you a job.
- l did my job.

605
01:16:33,647 --> 01:16:35,274
So how'd it go wrong?

606
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,401
l thought you wanted the case.

607
01:16:38,652 --> 01:16:40,404
Oh, we'll get the case.

608
01:16:40,488 --> 01:16:43,574
We'll get the case, eh, Gregor?

609
01:16:45,326 --> 01:16:47,203
Don't you worry about the case.

610
01:16:49,663 --> 01:16:51,832
What l want's an explanation.

611
01:16:51,957 --> 01:16:54,627
An explanation? For what?

612
01:16:54,794 --> 01:16:56,754
You bollixed it up.

613
01:16:56,962 --> 01:16:59,882
- l bollixed it up?
- You hired him.

614
01:17:00,007 --> 01:17:01,884
Through your fucking contact!

615
01:17:07,973 --> 01:17:11,685
- You didn't do your homework.
- Why did you have to kill Larry?

616
01:17:11,769 --> 01:17:13,646
Oh, Larry, is it?

617
01:17:14,814 --> 01:17:16,690
l was clearing up your mess.

618
01:17:16,774 --> 01:17:19,693
My mess?
Oh, well, you take over, then.

619
01:17:19,819 --> 01:17:21,695
- Eh?
- But you can't, can you?

620
01:17:21,821 --> 01:17:23,948
lt's you that's hiding, isn't it, Seamus?

621
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:26,492
lt's you that can't show your face.

622
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,623
Who else thinks that?
Who you been talking to?

623
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:34,959
lsn't that the reason
why l'm doing this job?

624
01:17:38,546 --> 01:17:40,423
You're a good girl, Deirdre.

625
01:17:41,841 --> 01:17:43,759
Do your job, eh?

626
01:17:57,481 --> 01:17:59,567
He's tough, your Yank.

627
01:18:00,943 --> 01:18:02,611
You're right about that.

628
01:18:04,822 --> 01:18:06,115
But who is he?

629
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:09,618
That's not important.

630
01:18:10,661 --> 01:18:13,414
Didn't he work for the ClA?

631
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,333
He used to.

632
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:18,544
Not anymore?

633
01:18:20,087 --> 01:18:21,797
He's on the run.

634
01:18:23,257 --> 01:18:24,800
You're sure?

635
01:18:24,884 --> 01:18:29,847
l know what he can do.
l've seen him.

636
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:32,391
Why would he carve himselfup
ifhe were still ClA?

637
01:18:32,475 --> 01:18:35,102
He makes a call and it's taken care of.

638
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:47,656
And you? How are you?

639
01:18:56,457 --> 01:19:01,921
We need some information.
We need to find some people in Paris.

640
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:03,005
Who?

641
01:19:03,547 --> 01:19:06,258
An lrish man and woman,

642
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:08,594
a German, an ex-KGB.

643
01:19:09,386 --> 01:19:10,513
They're professionals.

644
01:19:10,596 --> 01:19:12,056
They're in hiding.

645
01:19:12,765 --> 01:19:15,851
This is really important to you?

646
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,606
He saved my life.

647
01:19:23,442 --> 01:19:24,318
Bon.

648
01:19:26,779 --> 01:19:29,323
l'll find them for you.

649
01:19:48,092 --> 01:19:50,845
Where's the case?

650
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:56,267
lt will come tomorrow. l'm sure.

651
01:19:56,434 --> 01:19:59,937
Well, l'm sure it will, too. Let's go.

652
01:20:01,021 --> 01:20:03,399
Let's hope so, for your sake, anyway.

653
01:20:35,055 --> 01:20:37,224
Are you feeling better?

654
01:20:37,349 --> 01:20:39,518
Yeah, enough to move around. Thanks.

655
01:20:49,487 --> 01:20:51,363
My hobby.

656
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:54,366
One grows old.

657
01:20:56,077 --> 01:20:57,953
l knew a lot of fellas, friends of mine,

658
01:20:58,079 --> 01:20:59,955
they just wanted to live to open a bar.

659
01:21:00,039 --> 01:21:02,541
Had they lived,
would they have done it?

660
01:21:05,711 --> 01:21:08,881
- Then they were spared their disillusion.
- Yeah, that's right.

661
01:21:10,925 --> 01:21:13,052
Who were these people?
Friends of yours?

662
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:19,016
- l wouldn't hurt a friend.
- Was that my question?

663
01:21:20,476 --> 01:21:21,852
That's right.

664
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:30,694
Well, who are you?

665
01:21:32,363 --> 01:21:35,825
A fella like you,
trying to make it to retirement.

666
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:40,079
At the end of the day, we're likely
to be punished for our kindnesses.

667
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:43,207
You don't have to worry about me.
l won't hurt you.

668
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:13,362
The 47 ronin, do you know it?

669
01:22:15,364 --> 01:22:20,911
47 samurai whose master
was betrayed and killed by another lord.

670
01:22:20,995 --> 01:22:24,498
They became ronin, masterless samurai,

671
01:22:24,623 --> 01:22:26,876
disgraced by another man's treachery.

672
01:22:28,335 --> 01:22:30,921
For three years they plotted,
pretending to be thieves,

673
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,716
mercenaries, even madmen.

674
01:22:33,841 --> 01:22:36,260
That l didn't have time to do.

675
01:22:36,343 --> 01:22:38,721
And then one night they struck,
slipping into the castle

676
01:22:38,846 --> 01:22:40,806
of their lord's betrayer, killing him.

677
01:22:42,308 --> 01:22:44,727
Nice. l like that. My kind of job.

678
01:22:44,852 --> 01:22:46,812
There's something more.

679
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:52,568
All 47 of them committed seppuku,

680
01:22:52,693 --> 01:22:55,988
ritual suicide,
in the courtyard of the castle.

681
01:22:56,113 --> 01:22:58,908
Well, that l don't like so much.

682
01:22:59,033 --> 01:23:02,161
- But you understand it?
- What do you mean, l understand it?

683
01:23:04,205 --> 01:23:08,876
The warrior code, the delight in the battle.
You understand that, yes?

684
01:23:10,169 --> 01:23:13,089
But also something more.

685
01:23:13,172 --> 01:23:15,549
You understand there is something
outside yourself

686
01:23:15,674 --> 01:23:18,052
that has to be served.

687
01:23:18,177 --> 01:23:20,387
And when that need is gone,

688
01:23:20,513 --> 01:23:23,974
when belief has died, what are you?

689
01:23:24,058 --> 01:23:26,060
A man without a master.

690
01:23:26,227 --> 01:23:29,063
Right now l'm a man
without a pay cheque.

691
01:23:29,188 --> 01:23:32,900
The ronin could have hired
themselves to new masters.

692
01:23:33,025 --> 01:23:35,194
They could have fought
for themselves.

693
01:23:35,319 --> 01:23:38,322
But they chose honour.
They chose myth.

694
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:41,325
They chose wrong.

695
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:51,669
Seppu... Seppu... what?

696
01:23:51,794 --> 01:23:53,963
Yes, seppuku.

697
01:23:54,046 --> 01:23:56,298
Disembowelment.

698
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:59,176
The sword goes in here.

699
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:11,313
Are you sure this address is good?

700
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:13,357
Jean-Pierre gave it to me.

701
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:50,311
Under the bridge by the river...

702
01:24:50,436 --> 01:24:53,063
How did you know
it was an ambush?

703
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:55,691
Whenever there is any doubt,
there is no doubt.

704
01:24:55,816 --> 01:24:57,693
That's the first thing they teach you.

705
01:25:01,405 --> 01:25:04,116
Who taught you?

706
01:25:04,241 --> 01:25:07,411
l don't remember.
That's the second thing they teach you.

707
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:14,919
All good things
come to those who wait.

708
01:25:45,699 --> 01:25:49,286
- Why is Gregor still alive?
- He's taking them to the package.

709
01:26:13,894 --> 01:26:15,104
How ya doin'?

710
01:26:22,903 --> 01:26:25,656
What are you...
What are you gonna do to me?

711
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:31,036
Let's just be calm for one more moment.
One more moment.

712
01:26:43,758 --> 01:26:45,801
Why? Why?

713
01:26:45,926 --> 01:26:47,970
You know why.

714
01:26:48,053 --> 01:26:50,222
No. You don't wanna do that.

715
01:26:54,059 --> 01:26:55,019
You can't.

716
01:26:59,982 --> 01:27:00,608
Get back!

717
01:27:02,234 --> 01:27:04,195
Get in the fucking car!

718
01:27:14,163 --> 01:27:15,706
Why didn't you shoot her?

719
01:28:07,883 --> 01:28:09,635
Take the tunnel, now!

720
01:28:09,718 --> 01:28:11,720
Oh, Christ!

721
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:16,183
Eh, merde!

722
01:31:24,663 --> 01:31:25,998
Come on! Come on!

723
01:31:51,148 --> 01:31:53,109
All right, you fuck!

724
01:35:20,066 --> 01:35:22,443
Where could he be?

725
01:35:22,526 --> 01:35:26,489
- Where could he be?
- Hmm.

726
01:35:26,614 --> 01:35:30,076
The lrish and the Russians are looking
for him. So where does he go?

727
01:35:30,201 --> 01:35:34,038
He goes to the Russians
to make the deal for the case.

728
01:35:34,163 --> 01:35:37,625
Gregor ain't comin' in unless
he can figure out a safe exchange.

729
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:39,919
He knows they'll kill him for the case
rather than pay him for it.

730
01:35:40,044 --> 01:35:45,382
He's got to work it out soon
before the lrish find him.

731
01:35:46,717 --> 01:35:48,552
So where does he go?

732
01:35:50,429 --> 01:35:52,306
You go to what you know.

733
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:59,647
He's KGB.
He goes to one of his old safe houses.

734
01:36:01,107 --> 01:36:03,734
No, they're all blown.

735
01:36:03,859 --> 01:36:06,237
Where does he go?

736
01:36:11,992 --> 01:36:15,413
So, you're on the run.
Where do you go?

737
01:36:15,538 --> 01:36:17,456
Hmm?

738
01:36:21,585 --> 01:36:26,006
Where's he been? Where's he been?
Where's he been? Where's he been?

739
01:36:37,768 --> 01:36:40,354
He made the fake case.

740
01:36:40,438 --> 01:36:42,815
He had the fake case made.

741
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:46,402
Gregor. He had it made.

742
01:36:46,527 --> 01:36:49,071
He had to have had it made.

743
01:36:50,614 --> 01:36:53,701
ln Paris, before we went to Nice.

744
01:36:53,784 --> 01:36:55,619
He didn't have time to have it made.

745
01:36:55,745 --> 01:36:57,913
He bought something that looked like it,
then spray-painted it.

746
01:36:57,997 --> 01:37:00,583
Where did he get the spray?
He never left the room.

747
01:37:00,708 --> 01:37:02,668
Where did he get the case?

748
01:37:12,303 --> 01:37:14,555
Excusez-moi, monsieur.

749
01:37:35,868 --> 01:37:37,703
lt's a case for ice skates.

750
01:37:41,332 --> 01:37:43,209
Why ice skates?

751
01:37:45,544 --> 01:37:47,505
And why would Gregor
know an ice-skate case?

752
01:37:49,548 --> 01:37:52,009
He didn't have time to have it made.

753
01:37:52,134 --> 01:37:56,931
He didn't have time to have it made.
The Russians made it.

754
01:37:58,891 --> 01:38:01,477
The Russians made it.

755
01:38:04,647 --> 01:38:06,482
We're following the wrong people.

756
01:38:06,607 --> 01:38:09,527
We don't have to find Gregor.

757
01:38:09,652 --> 01:38:12,363
We find the Russians,
they will take us to him.

758
01:38:12,488 --> 01:38:16,367
You've lived in Paris
a long time. You know the people.

759
01:38:16,450 --> 01:38:19,495
- l get around.
- You meet the new Russians.

760
01:38:19,578 --> 01:38:23,499
You know how it is.
Ex-spies. Now it's Mafia.

761
01:38:24,375 --> 01:38:26,502
Under diplomatic cover.

762
01:38:28,087 --> 01:38:29,088
KGB?

763
01:38:29,338 --> 01:38:30,297
Ex-KGB.

764
01:38:30,714 --> 01:38:35,302
Heavy hitters, gamblers,
lots of money, big cars.

765
01:38:35,428 --> 01:38:36,804
They live like tsars.
Throw money away.

766
01:38:36,887 --> 01:38:38,764
Fur hats are expensive.

767
01:38:38,848 --> 01:38:44,270
- And bodyguards.
- Expensive coats, Dr Zhivago.

768
01:38:44,395 --> 01:38:47,565
l have a lot of work, no time.

769
01:38:49,024 --> 01:38:50,693
l understand.

770
01:38:52,403 --> 01:38:54,113
All right. Let's go.

771
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:56,031
Okay.

772
01:39:03,205 --> 01:39:04,832
lt will be fine.

773
01:39:06,292 --> 01:39:08,169
The guy is gonna reach out.

774
01:39:08,252 --> 01:39:10,171
ls he any good?

775
01:39:10,296 --> 01:39:13,174
Jean-Pierre says if it's Russian
and it's in Paris...

776
01:39:24,310 --> 01:39:27,688
lfl wanted to find Russians
in Paris this week,

777
01:39:27,772 --> 01:39:31,942
l'd go to the ice show.

778
01:40:45,975 --> 01:40:48,102
- Bonsoir, Pierre.
- Bonsoir.

779
01:40:48,185 --> 01:40:50,104
Je vais payer pour votre soeur.

780
01:40:50,187 --> 01:40:53,566
Oh, merci beaucoup,
Mademoiselle Kirilova.

781
01:41:00,072 --> 01:41:04,827
l'll trade you a cigarette for a favour.

782
01:41:05,369 --> 01:41:07,288
The favour is, steer clear of those guys.

783
01:41:07,371 --> 01:41:08,873
Who? The Russians?

784
01:41:15,379 --> 01:41:17,590
They sure throw their money around.

785
01:41:18,716 --> 01:41:19,800
Bonsoir.

786
01:41:19,884 --> 01:41:22,094
- ça va?
- Salut.

787
01:41:25,431 --> 01:41:27,308
- Bonsoir.
- Ah, bonsoir.

788
01:41:33,814 --> 01:41:38,152
The Russian is seeing Natacha Kirilova,
the star of the ice show.

789
01:41:38,235 --> 01:41:41,822
He spends every evening in the audience.

790
01:41:43,074 --> 01:41:44,617
How did you find that out?

791
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:47,953
We went to high school together.

792
01:42:22,238 --> 01:42:24,657
Mikhi, is everything all right?

793
01:42:25,491 --> 01:42:26,867
Everything is fine.

794
01:42:28,077 --> 01:42:29,120
Sweet girl.

795
01:42:31,914 --> 01:42:32,915
Go. Go on.

796
01:42:51,934 --> 01:42:53,644
Ladies and gentlemen!

797
01:42:53,728 --> 01:42:57,022
We are very proud to present...

798
01:42:57,106 --> 01:43:04,029
.. two-time Olympic champion
and three-time World champion,...

799
01:43:04,113 --> 01:43:07,700
.. Natacha Kirilova!

800
01:45:13,993 --> 01:45:15,911
Let's go.

801
01:45:29,258 --> 01:45:31,385
Wait out here.

802
01:45:36,348 --> 01:45:38,601
Yes, he is.

803
01:45:38,684 --> 01:45:40,728
Hello, Mikhi.

804
01:45:40,936 --> 01:45:44,940
- The meeting is not till later tonight.
- The meeting's now.

805
01:45:48,277 --> 01:45:49,862
You have the money?

806
01:45:51,197 --> 01:45:55,117
Well, we were going to go back
to get it before the meet.

807
01:45:55,242 --> 01:45:56,327
l don't think so.

808
01:45:57,787 --> 01:45:59,705
You have the money?

809
01:46:04,126 --> 01:46:07,129
l might have the money.
Where is the case?

810
01:46:07,213 --> 01:46:11,592
No, you have to do it.
l couldn't live with myself.

811
01:46:24,563 --> 01:46:26,440
l have the money.

812
01:46:26,565 --> 01:46:29,068
We conclude this now
and part friends.

813
01:46:29,151 --> 01:46:30,945
Okay?

814
01:46:33,864 --> 01:46:34,907
Where is the case?

815
01:46:47,294 --> 01:46:49,171
l'd like to be paid now.

816
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:56,929
No doubt.

817
01:47:01,684 --> 01:47:03,561
Now tell me the other part.

818
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:07,189
The other part?

819
01:47:07,356 --> 01:47:09,191
l'm leaving.

820
01:47:09,316 --> 01:47:12,194
l'm taking my fee and l'm leaving.

821
01:47:13,821 --> 01:47:16,907
l have a person with a rifle in the stadium.

822
01:47:17,116 --> 01:47:19,952
l've worked with her for years.
She never misses.

823
01:47:20,077 --> 01:47:23,038
l will call.

824
01:47:23,164 --> 01:47:25,499
l have to call within 45 seconds

825
01:47:25,624 --> 01:47:27,668
to say that l'm leaving,

826
01:47:27,877 --> 01:47:31,005
and then in another 10 minutes
to say that l'm safe.

827
01:47:32,673 --> 01:47:36,594
Should l be unable to call,
your friend will be shot.

828
01:47:46,437 --> 01:47:48,314
30 seconds, Mikhi.

829
01:47:49,732 --> 01:47:52,234
- We need to get inside.
- You can'tpass without badges.

830
01:47:59,575 --> 01:48:01,410
20 seconds.

831
01:48:12,088 --> 01:48:13,089
10 seconds.

832
01:48:42,326 --> 01:48:45,204
There were two ofthem.

833
01:48:45,287 --> 01:48:46,997
They were looking for those guys.

834
01:48:47,081 --> 01:48:49,250
Just a minute, sir!

835
01:49:05,808 --> 01:49:09,729
I am a Chilean citizen,
as you can see from my passport.

836
01:49:09,812 --> 01:49:11,480
Merci.

837
01:49:49,935 --> 01:49:53,105
- Mama!
- Shh, shh, shh.

838
01:49:58,944 --> 01:50:00,571
Katchev!

839
01:50:00,654 --> 01:50:01,822
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

840
01:50:16,879 --> 01:50:17,838
Stay with him.

841
01:50:50,704 --> 01:50:53,249
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

842
01:50:53,416 --> 01:50:56,210
Get out of the car.
Walk away. Walk away!

843
01:50:56,293 --> 01:50:59,130
Walk away! Go. Go.

844
01:50:59,213 --> 01:51:02,091
- l will if you will.
- Just go.

845
01:51:02,174 --> 01:51:04,635
Come with me.
Forget about the case.

846
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:11,517
l didn't come for the case.
l came for your boss.

847
01:51:13,394 --> 01:51:15,980
l came for Seamus. l came for him.

848
01:51:17,356 --> 01:51:22,278
Just get out of here.
l never left. Don't you see?

849
01:51:23,654 --> 01:51:25,948
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

850
01:51:34,331 --> 01:51:35,666
Get out of the way!

851
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:37,084
This way is blocked.

852
01:52:04,904 --> 01:52:06,781
l can take you in or leave you here.

853
01:52:08,282 --> 01:52:09,533
There. That's him with the case.

854
01:52:09,617 --> 01:52:11,744
Sir! Over here, please.

855
01:52:11,869 --> 01:52:12,578
Wait! Wait!

856
01:52:20,211 --> 01:52:23,255
There are more back there!

857
01:53:00,543 --> 01:53:02,420
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!

858
01:53:02,503 --> 01:53:06,382
Don't move! Shut your fuckin' mouth up!
Shut your mouth!

859
01:53:20,396 --> 01:53:22,231
You stupid shite.

860
01:53:22,398 --> 01:53:25,943
You're a dead man.

861
01:53:48,466 --> 01:53:50,843
This is the BBC World Service.

862
01:53:50,968 --> 01:53:53,679
lt was announced today,
after almost 30 years

863
01:53:53,763 --> 01:53:57,141
ofbloody and seemingly intractable
civil conflict in Northern lreland,

864
01:53:57,224 --> 01:53:59,143
that a peace agreement
has been reached between

865
01:53:59,268 --> 01:54:02,480
the predominantly Protestant
government ofthat British-ruled enclave,

866
01:54:02,605 --> 01:54:05,149
and the lrish resistance...

867
01:54:09,987 --> 01:54:13,532
.. have told CNN that it was
the apprehension and slaying

868
01:54:13,657 --> 01:54:18,496
in France ofthe lrish terrorist Seamus
O'Rourke, byparties still unknown,

869
01:54:18,579 --> 01:54:20,873
that contributed a stability,
largely allowing

870
01:54:20,998 --> 01:54:25,002
the negotiations to proceed
to their historic conclusion today.

871
01:54:25,127 --> 01:54:28,047
O'Rourke had earlier
been denounced by the lRA,

872
01:54:28,172 --> 01:54:32,218
the military wing of Sinn Fein,
as a rogue breakaway operative.

873
01:54:34,762 --> 01:54:38,099
Well, then, good knowin' ya.

874
01:54:48,818 --> 01:54:49,819
Hmm?

875
01:54:49,902 --> 01:54:53,114
- l'm sorry?
- You said something.

876
01:54:53,197 --> 01:54:56,659
l said she would not
be coming back here.

877
01:54:58,869 --> 01:55:03,332
Yeah. She would
not be coming back here, would she?

878
01:55:09,588 --> 01:55:11,674
l can't even put my hand in my pocket
to pay the bill.

879
01:55:11,757 --> 01:55:13,884
l'll get it.

880
01:55:16,429 --> 01:55:18,264
l'll get the next one.

881
01:55:24,603 --> 01:55:26,355
What was in the case?

882
01:55:26,564 --> 01:55:28,607
l don't remember.

883
01:55:29,942 --> 01:55:31,485
Lesson number two.

884
01:55:33,654 --> 01:55:35,531
Keep in touch.

885
01:55:54,049 --> 01:55:55,885
Let's go.

886
01:56:09,106 --> 01:56:11,901
No questions, no answers.

887
01:56:11,984 --> 01:56:14,070
That's the business we're in.

888
01:56:14,195 --> 01:56:16,489
You accept it and move on.

889
01:56:17,907 --> 01:56:20,701
Maybe that's lesson number three.
