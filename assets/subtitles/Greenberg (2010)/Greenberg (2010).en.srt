1
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,040
Are you going to let me in?

2
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,116
Thank you.

3
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,340
Shoot, I left the ticket in the car, I think.

4
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,010
- It's okay. - It's under "Phillip Greenberg."

5
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,244
It's just one?

6
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,186
It's two shirts and a pair of pants.

7
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,732
Do you mind if it is all ones?

8
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,326
No problem. Okay, sorry.

9
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:29,999
Florence.

10
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,407
Hi, guys.

11
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,076
Let me put this stuff down.

12
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,137
- Hi, Mahler. - Florence!

13
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,506
We're going on vacation!

14
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,572
I know.

15
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,743
- We're going to Vietnam. - I know.

16
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,151
But we will come back, right? We're not going to live there?

17
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,951
No, that's why it's a vacation.

18
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,581
Are you going to go with us?

19
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,320
- No, remember? I have to stay here. - Why?

20
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,089
- Because I do. - Why?

21
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,893
Because the vacation is for family members only,

22
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,025
so Mahler and I have to stay in LA.

23
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,968
Mahler isn't coming? I want Mahler to come.

24
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,029
Did you get the neck pillow?

25
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,975
Yes. They didn't have those chocolate-covered rice balls.

26
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,102
Did you try Trader Joe's?

27
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,703
Yeah, and Bristol Farms.

28
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,840
Were you able to find the liquid decongestant?

29
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,449
Shoot! Sorry. I'm sorry.

30
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,111
It's okay, Florence. Don't worry about it.

31
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,348
- It's fine. - No, no, no.

32
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,624
And can you tell the gardener to

33
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,896
check the sensor on the sprinklers?

34
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:25,953
I'll tell Carlos.

35
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,021
There's a package I need you to mail to my father.

36
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,192
What else?

37
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,792
I don't need this many T-shirts.

38
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,393
Did you tell her about your brother?

39
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,529
My brother will be staying here.

40
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,038
He might call you with things,

41
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,472
questions or an errand or two.

42
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,940
- That's not a problem. - He's coming in from New York.

43
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,602
- He just got out of the hospital. - Is he sick?

44
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,612
Not that kind of hospital. He had a nervous breakdown.

45
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,477
- Carol, come on. - It's relevant. He's fine.

46
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,243
- Don't pack this skirt. - He really is fine now.

47
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,046
I mean, he's delicate, but...

48
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,711
We're hiring him to do some work around the house.

49
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,722
He's a carpenter. He's gonna make Mahler a dog house.

50
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,848
He says he's going to.

51
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,721
- That'll look nice. - We hope.

52
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,055
Have a great trip, you guys.

53
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,322
Okay.

54
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,014
And I'll call you if there's anything else,

55
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:00,160
which I'm sure there is.

56
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,291
- It's no problem. - I want you to come with us.

57
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,927
And you'll confirm the car service and flight info for tonight?

58
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,437
Yes, and I'll put the cars in the garage.

59
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,167
Okay, and we can call or e-mail.

60
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,503
I'm sure there's e-mail in Vietnam.

61
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,906
I think there's e-mail everywhere.

62
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,639
I forgot to write you a check. What do we owe you now?

63
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,704
Don't worry about it. It's three weeks...

64
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,114
Oh, Florence, you have to speak up.

65
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:18,114
I'm out of checks.

66
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,617
- I want Mahler to come. - I know, I know,

67
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,086
- But it's fine. - I'll give you cash in the meantime.

68
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,664
No, no. Don't worry about it. It's really...

69
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:24,385
It's better this way.

70
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,225
- Because then I don't spend it all at once. - Are you sure?

71
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,588
I'll leave it for you in the kitchen drawer before we go.

72
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,786
- I'll let my brother know. - Okay.

73
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,260
Okay. Bye.

74
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,393
- Okay. - I'll see you soon.

75
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,660
- It's okay. Let's say goodbye. - Bye.

76
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,099
Bye, Florence.

77
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,227
Bye.

78
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,465
Florence, it's Gina.

79
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,705
I'm here. It's packed.

80
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,766
Don't park on Alvarado, park on Montana.

81
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,868
Don't wander away.

82
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:46,969
Okay.

83
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,042
Let's make a point of sticking together.

84
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,413
Okay.

85
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,918
- Can I borrow 40 bucks until tomorrow? - Yeah.

86
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,936
I was thinking this morning that I've been out of college now

87
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,069
for as long as I was in,

88
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,374
And nobody cares if I get up in the morning.

89
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,185
Florence, it's time to go home now.

90
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,822
I'm gonna stay.

91
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,233
I don't know...

92
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,675
I just got out of a long relationship.

93
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,640
This isn't a relationship.

94
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,845
Right, I know.

95
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,744
Okay.

96
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,270
Are you going to let me in?

97
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,446
No. Okay.

98
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,655
- Hello? - Hi, this is Roger Greenberg.

99
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,591
I'm Phillip's brother.

100
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,122
Hey.

101
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,526
Is this Florence?

102
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,826
Sorry. I'm quitting e-mail.

103
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,001
Okay. Hi.

104
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,533
There are people in the pool.

105
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,737
That's Marlon and Peggy.

106
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,474
Okay.

107
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:38,005
Your brother and Carol let Marlon and Peggy use the pool.

108
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,981
There's more than two.

109
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,020
They don't come in the house.

110
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,750
Okay, thanks.

111
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:49,593
Your brother left a check for me. Is it okay if I come by?

112
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,760
Yeah, I'll be here.

113
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,705
"Dear American Airlines,

114
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,503
"I'm not much in the habit of writing letters of complaint.

115
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,975
"I think I could have lived, and did,

116
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,103
"with the distance between your rows.

117
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,272
"But my issue is not with the lack of leg room,

118
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,942
"It is instead with the quality of the buttons on the seats.

119
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,484
"When I depress my recliner button,

120
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,452
"I expect the chair to recline.

121
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,148
"At the very least, to move.

122
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,319
"This was not the case

123
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,454
with seat 26C on flight 41 from JFK..."

124
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,023
Hi, little Mahler baby.

125
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,571
Hi, I'm Florence. I hope that this isn't a bad time.

126
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,764
My check.

127
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,066
No, I guess it's fine.

128
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,569
Okay.

129
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,273
Do you want a treat?

130
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,943
Come here. Come here.

131
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,042
His tongue's so scratchy.

132
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,450
Good dog.

133
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,570
Remember how they used to play this

134
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:36,000
on the radio every time it rained?

135
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,592
I'm not sure.

136
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:43,132
And if there was a fire, they'd play Burn Baby, Burn.

137
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,844
Or, what was it called?

138
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,669
Disco Inferno.

139
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,047
I don't think I know it.

140
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,448
It's funny.

141
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,485
Before your time, I guess.

142
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,562
You have to see past the kitsch.

143
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,497
I can see past it.

144
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,570
Cool.

145
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,045
Phillip said if you need anything,

146
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,210
I can go pick you up groceries or things.

147
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,985
- I'm okay. - You sure? It's not a problem.

148
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,823
Well, I guess I could use some things.

149
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,292
Sure. Make a list. I'll be right back.

150
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:48,888


151
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,822
I'm gonna take him on a w-a-l-k.

152
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,790
Oh, no. No, I got it.

153
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,426
Okay, cool.

154
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,788
Bye.

155
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:03,916


156
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,983
This is Ivan. Leave a message after the tone.

157
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,860
Ivan, it's Greenberg. How you doing, man?

158
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,665
I'm in LA.

159
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,569
I'm, seriously, in from New York city.

160
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,465
So, give me a call. I'm staying at my brother's house.

161
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,170
He's in Vietnam.

162
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,607
I think he's opening a hotel there or something.

163
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,910
Give me a call, man. It'd be great to see you.

164
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,920
"Dear Mayor Bloomberg,

165
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,758
"I write as a concerned citizen that has finally had enough

166
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,993
"of the abominable traffic noise that has engulfed the city.

167
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,294
"If you placed a police officer

168
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,529
"at strategically chosen corners of Manhattan,

169
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,037
"It would result in the needed employment of crime fighters,

170
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,184
"less crime and trafficking,

00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:11,202
"and a lower contingent of horn-honkers.

172
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,108
"If you're into green... And who isn't?

173
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,113
"It'll make for a significant reduction in noise pollution.

174
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,048
"If they can do it in LA, a car culture if ever there was one,

175
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,881
"I'm confident we can do it here in Manhattan."

176
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,648
It's true. No one really honks here.

177
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,516
Yeah. In LA, they understand

178
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:25,713
the horn is for emergencies only.

179
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,486
- In New York, it's a constant. - Yeah.

180
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,620
I don't know. I don't really recognize

181
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:31,086
New York anymore, you know?

182
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,152
"You might be interested to know

183
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,927
"that in the relatively recently acquired state of Hawaii,

184
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,012
"there's a law on the books that

185
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:39,528
"prohibits the honking of horns entirely.

186
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:44,167
"Yours in hopes of green sound, Roger Greenberg."

187
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,108
When did you get in?

188
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,871
Only Monday. You're the first person I called.

189
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,473
- No, I didn't mean... - No, I know. I was just saying.

190
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,882
Right. How long you staying for?

191
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,352
About six weeks.

192
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,820
Can you imagine going to Vietnam?

193
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:57,913
What, to fight?

194
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,981
Well, to fight, too, but I just meant now.

195
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,323
My brother and his wife are there on vacation.

196
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,918
I don't know.

197
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,459
Some people like to travel.

198
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,233
That's my brother's wife's daughter, Sara.

199
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,528
My step-sister?

200
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,267
Niece.

201
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,631
She's at UC Santa Cruz.

202
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,268
Uh, no, thanks, man. I don't really drink anymore.

203
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,576
Okay.

204
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,383
Yeah, it's for the best.

205
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,898
I've got into these Arnold Palmer's. 

206
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,215
Iced tea, lemonade.

207
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,777
Yeah, I don't have that.

208
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,789
I thought I'd told you.

209
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,919
I guess I think we talk more than we do.

210
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,456
- The beard is cool. - Yeah.

211
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,659
You know, it's a winter beard.

212
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,206
I probably shouldn't be on the table here.

213
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,702
Maybe don't sit on the speaker.

214
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,177
Sorry.

215
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,815
So, what do you want to do today?

216
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,476
Beller's having a barbeque, which means, you know...

217
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,454
Oh, what's he up to?

218
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,152
He directs television. He calls me up with computer questions.

219
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,489
What a dick.

220
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,687
He always offers to pay.

221
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,628
Yeah, still rude.

222
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,229
Let's not do that.

223
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,930
What else, man?

224
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,939
We could get a drink at a bar, we could stay here.

225
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,413
They have videos.

226
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,040
I think I saw Mannequin.

227
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,181
And, gung ho?

228
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,113
I remember that being funny.

229
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,950
- Gung ho's good. - Yeah.

230
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,320
It'd be interesting to watch it now.

231
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,824
In the day?

232
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,559
I meant now, like, you know...

233
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,688
- These days. - Yeah. Now.

234
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:46,890
- It's supposed to.. - It was made...

235
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,833
I'm not sure about these pants. They look flary to you?

236
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,067
No, I think that's the style.

237
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,234
I feel like I should have worn jeans.

238
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,210
No one's going to be dressed up at this thing.

239
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,372
Fabula and I are on this trial separation.

240
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,850
It's a lot to go into.

241
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,789
I feel terrible for Victor, you know.

242
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,724
I'd love you to meet him. He's like a little person now.

243
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,386
Yeah, I saw him a few years ago.

244
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,311
Yeah, but now he's eight. He's like a friend.

245
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:21,957
He's fun to hang out with.

246
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,594
I'm glad you're here, man.

247
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,696
It's good for me to get out like this.

248
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,799
Want to put your blinker on?

249
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,278
Casa de Beller.

250
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,444
Keep going. Keep going.

251
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,454
Keep going.

252
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,718
What a fucking nightmare.

253
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,124
Maybe we can park here.

254
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,354
No, no, no. Let's go home.

255
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,393
I shouldn't have let you talk me into this.

256
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:53,398
It's a nightmare here.

257
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,057
It's this kind of shit...

258
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,604
I can't find a movie I want to

259
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:57,830
go to in the fucking multiplex,

260
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,202
or when I'm in Starbucks, I hear music I actually like.

261
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,571
But we drove all the way out here. Let's have one drink.

262
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,485
Is this a fucking children's party?

263
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,755
Beller, how are you?

264
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,022
I'm good.

265
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,222
- Hey, man. - Johno.

266
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,390
Hey, Greenberg, what are you doing out here?

267
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,455
You know...

268
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,934
- Beth. - Oh, my god.

269
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,231
Should I know? Are you really big or something?

270
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,604
No, Megan.

271
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,103
I didn't know you were out here.

272
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,576
I wasn't.

273
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,636
How is Lenny?

274
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,382
Oh, dude, or what about Your Grandma's Pussy?

275
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,352
It's like anacond, with seven cards down.

276
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,855
I'm fair to middling. You know.

277
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,815
Leonard Maltin would give me two-and-a-half stars.

278
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,861
I haven't seen you since, probably, like 10 years ago.

279
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,543
In his movie guide. Yeah, I think it

280
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:00,023
was actually Matt Levy's wedding.

281
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,066
I'm all shits and giggles today.

282
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,661
Yeah. I think you'll find I'm pretty much all shits.

283
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,539
- It's sad about Matt Levy. - Yeah.

284
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,266
Wait, what happened?

285
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,741
Oh, you didn't hear.

286
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,171
He died.

287
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,177
- Texas hold 'em is dead. - It's dead.

288
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,877
You know, that shit just makes your lips drier.

289
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,214
I know.

290
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,479
There's Beth.

291
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,886
She and Steven are getting a divorce.

292
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,293
They were a cool couple.

293
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,796
Are any of those yours?

294
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:36,595
Yes, mine are the one in the bumblebee costume

295
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,034
and the one in the devil costume.

296
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,102
I think that's the Flash.

297
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,697
All the men out here dress like children,

298
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,674
And the kids dress like superheroes.

299
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,711
- Hi, dad. - Hey, sweet pea.

300
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,610
Come to think of it, Steven's kind of

301
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:51,442
a less jewish-looking version of you.

302
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,007
Less? I'm not even... I'm only half.

303
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,111
Yeah, but you're doing this.

304
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,450
What's...

305
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,152
I'm thinking small.

306
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,419
Is this a Jewish gesture?

307
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,824
I don't know.

308
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,254
Beller, always with the self-hatred.

309
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,524
- You're sweating. - I am. Yeah.

310
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,430
Have you been to one of Eric's seders?

311
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,628
Eric gave trees to Israel.

312
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,495
Am I not allowed to joke about it?

313
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,532
No, I know. I'm just saying,

314
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:15,802
since you said "less jewish-Looking,"

315
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,364
Because most people think I look Italian.

316
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,875
And since my mom was actually protestant,

317
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,105
I'm not actually Jewish at all, so...

318
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,008
Good to see you.

319
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,316
What are you doing these days?

320
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,014
- You're in new york, right? - Yeah.

321
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,316
Making music?

322
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,085
Haven't played music in years.

323
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,092
I'm a carpenter, you know, for money.

324
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,290
But right now, I'm really trying to do nothing for a while.

325
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,024
That's brave at our age.

326
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,832
I'm here for a few weeks at my brother's,

327
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,070
and wanna have a drink or something?

328
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,577
Sure. Okay.

329
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,235
"Dear Starbucks,

330
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,540
"in your attempt to manufacture culture out of fast-food coffee,

331
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,672
"you've been surprisingly successful, for the most part.

332
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,276
"the part that isn't covered by 'the most part' sucks."

333
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,338


334
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,053
Florence, hey, it's Roger Greenberg.

335
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,356
Sorry, I'm eating.

336
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:21,865
That's okay.

337
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,933
You wanna have a drink or something?

338
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,840
Sure. Okay.

339
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,904
Is there a bar you know we can go to?

340
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,644
There's one near my apartment, but it's pretty lame.

341
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:39,945
Okay.

342
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,545
It's in Culver City. Do you want to meet me there?

343
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,953
I don't drive.

344
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,256
Those are all kind of cheesy.

345
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,325
You have the light.

346
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,623
Do you mind if we stop by my house? 

347
00:24:07,624 --> 00:24:09,611
I left my purse. Sorry.

348
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,641
Do you need it?

349
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,578
I still get carded.

350
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,622
I don't read enough.

351
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,795
I'm such a bad reader.

352
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,558
Is that you?

353
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,326
Yeah, it's one of the rare times

354
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,425
I was actually happy around my dad.

355
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,972
Did you do that?

356
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,735
No, that's my niece.

357
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,241
It's good.

358
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,043
She's four.

359
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,135
I want to have a relationship with her,

360
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,478
she's just not that friendly with me.

361
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,218
You want to see? I got her these puppets for her birthday.

362
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,053
They might be too old. They have sticks.

363
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,426
Yeah. I'm sure they'll be fine.

364
00:24:58,597 --> 00:24:59,996
What do you have to drink?

365
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,866
Okay, you don't want to go to the bar?

366
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,336
It's Friday. The bars are probably

367
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,168
full of bridge and tunnel people.

368
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,574
Or whatever the LA version of bridge and tunnel is.

369
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,940
Sorry.

370
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,317
I don't really have...

371
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:23,030
There's a Corona Light and some cheap

372
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:25,219
tequila someone left here once.

373
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,284
Shall we split the Corona?

374
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,521
Okay.

375
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,590
I get the hiccups when I first drink carbonation.

376
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,523
Don't worry about it.

377
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,053
I'm wearing kind of an ugly bra.

378
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,322
It's like an ace bandage. There's no clasp.

379
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,780
Do you hear a train?

380
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,478
Is that a train?

381
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,455
I get kind of nerdy.

382
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,856
Don't worry about it.

383
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,061
Can we take it slow?

384
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,125
I'm sorry, it's just that...

385
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,000
I just got out of a long relationship,

386
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,301
And I don't want to go from just having sex

387
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,569
To just having sex to just having sex.

388
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,743
Who's the third "just having sex"?

389
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,807
You, if we had sex.

390
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,816
Okay, then who's the second?

391
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,412
A guy I met at this gallery thing.

392
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,454
You slept with him?

393
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,561
Yeah, I did.

394
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,224
How did that go?

395
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,032
What do you mean? The sex?

396
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,568
Yeah. 

397
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,206
It was pretty awkward.

398
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,610
What is that on your lip?

399
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,745
What?

400
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,418
- Is that a... - nothing.

401
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,990
- No, it's not a cold sore. - You sure?

402
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,755
Yeah, I picked it.

403
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,796
Where's your bathroom?

404
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,608
This is so annoying,

405
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:45,578
but I have to call my friend, Gina, back.

406
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,960
Sorry, it's just, if I don't call her back,

407
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:49,354
then I'll be a bad friend.

408
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,952
She's always got an emergency. I'm sure it's nothing.

409
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,157
How far do you think it would be to walk?

410
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,531
To your brother's?

411
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,593
Way too long, like five miles. You can stay here.

412
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,571
I have the dog and...

413
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,333
I can drive you. This will only take a second.

414
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,838
You have to call her right this moment?

415
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,779
Won't she understand you're in the middle of a...

416
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,682
No, no. I'll take you now. Sorry.

417
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,982
You know, I... you don't have to do that. You've got your robe...

418
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,612
No. It's not a problem.

419
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,054
I can probably call a cab.

420
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,284
Okay.

421
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,322
This is stupid.

422
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,318
I'm singing this Saturday 

423
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,627
at this place on orange and sunset.

424
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,304
I mean, if you feel like it. 

425
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:32,635
I know it's last minute.

426
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,732
My friend gina made the flyers

427
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,775
and she wrote down the address wrong.

428
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,272
I don't think... What time?

429
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,505
Like 11:30.

430
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,139
There's a lot of acts, so it's kind of hard to pinpoint.

431
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,115
Don't feel obligated.

432
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,345
We probably shouldn't do this again.

433
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,187
- I mean, you work for my brother. - Yeah.

434
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,384
And I'm really trying to do nothing right now.

435
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,687
That's cool.

436
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,923
And I've got to stop doing things just 'cause they feel good.

437
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,899
A mental patient just went down on you.

438
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,027
Why do you say it like that? He's not crazy.

439
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,705
A lot of people go to insane asylums.

440
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,035
A lot of people are in therapy,

441
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:14,912
They're not in insane asylums.

442
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,403
He's also 40.

443
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,146
Jesus.

444
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,749
He seems vulnerable.

445
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,517
I'm awake now.

446
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,556
- That could happen. - what?

447
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:39,933
It'd have to be a super high-end fucking garbage disposal.

448
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,199
You can't hold any revelations I had.

449
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,572
During a shamanic ceremony against me.

450
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,441
- There. You're judging me. - That guy's there.

451
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:49,872
Oh, hey, what's up, man?

452
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,950
Why am I still pissed off? We were 25.

453
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,610
We finally got a break, and you had to fuck it up.

454
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,745
I didn't like the deal.

455
00:30:56,821 --> 00:31:00,621
It was completely standard. It was a record deal, Roger, okay?

456
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,319
It was a very big thing for us and

457
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,027
We were not gonna get any better than that.

458
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,427
It was corporate bullshit.

459
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,896
I didn't want to be a slave to the A and R department.

460
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,991
They'd fuck with the songs. We had no control.

461
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,263
You were not the only person in the band, Roger.

462
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,271
Do you understand that?

463
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,972
It's morally reprehensible what you did.

464
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,737
I'm sorry, but I didn't want to do it unless it was on our terms.

465
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,039
Well, you got your way, you know.

466
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,636
There's no record. There's no band.

467
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,309
There's your terms. Awesome.

468
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,043
Beller, it was 15 years ago.

469
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:29,280
You're rich. What do you care? You've done all right.

470
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,219
- It doesn't matter. - No, it does matter.

471
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,314
You're not the person who I thought you were.

472
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,682
What about Ivan? 

473
00:31:34,683 --> 00:31:35,586
He's fixing computers now.

474
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,957
This could have changed his life.

475
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,196
Ivan was counting on it. 

476
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:39,656
He co-wrote those songs with you, man.

477
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,993
Ivan wrote some of the music with me.

478
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,828
Stop rationalizing.

479
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,666
Ivan can take care of himself.

480
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,997
I'm surprised he still speaks to you.

481
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,539
You know, why am I even here?

482
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,734
You're never gonna change.

483
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,379
What's that? What's that sigh?

484
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:58,910
Nothing.

485
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,019
What are you doing? Asshole.

486
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,794
Go get it.

487
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,328
Go get it.

488
00:33:27,444 --> 00:33:29,172


489
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,697
What the fuck?

490
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,383
Florence, it's Roger Greenberg.

491
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,630
Mahler's... he's breathing weird,

492
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,690
and he's suddenly lethargic and...

493
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,360
sometimes he gets overheated.

494
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,336
No, I mean, he hasn't moved, period.

495
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,737
And I can't get through to fucking Vietnam,

496
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,435
and I'm sorry to have to call you.

497
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,035
I just... I don't know if you know...

498
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,217
How long do we wait?

499
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,050
I don't know. They seem kind of busy.

500
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,821
Should I go ask?

501
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,597
If you want.

502
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,595
Do you wanna do it?

503
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,794
Okay.

504
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,069
They know we're here, but...

505
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,840
Do you know how much longer for Mahler?

506
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,180
You know, I think we're just waiting

507
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,446
for a doctor to get out of the room.

508
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:50,810
Okay.

509
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,525
She thinks that they're just waiting

510
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,995
for a doctor to get out of the room.

511
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,123
Yeah, I could hear her.

512
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,827
I think it's sciatica.

513
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,838
Yeah, he's had that before.

514
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:11,360
But his eyes are jaundiced, 

515
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,342
so I'd like to run some tests

516
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,332
and I will keep him overnight just

517
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,141
to make sure everything is okay.

518
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,409
And I imagine you can bring him home tomorrow.

519
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,780
- Thank you. - It's okay.

520
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,713
They gave him an infusion?

521
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,816
Is it his white blood cells or his red blood cells?

522
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,417
I'm pretty sure white.

523
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,931
Well, it makes a difference. Are you taking notes?

524
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,090
I haven't yet, no.

525
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,758
You have to write this stuff down

526
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,028
if you're not gonna remember it.

527
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:41,094
I'm sorry. I'm almost positive it's white.

528
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,106
Did you ask him about the dog house?

529
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,471
When's he coming home?

530
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,668
He was supposed to come home today,

531
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,579
but the numbers dropped and they

532
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,474
wanna keep him until he's stable.

533
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,538
But they asked if the gardeners use rat poison.

534
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:52,844
They're not supposed to.

535
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,748
Shit! should we be getting on a plane?

536
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,514
No. No, he'll be okay.

537
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,987
- I mean, I'll let you know if... - Fuck.

538
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,448
Mahler.

539
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,822
Has he started the dog house?

540
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,588
I'll call Florence and get the information.

541
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,349
I'm doing it, okay? So you can call me.

542
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,562
'Cause I pretty much got it.

543
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,292
Pretty much isn't very comforting to Carol and me.

544
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,459
Yeah, well, he's not my dog, okay?

545
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,859
I'm trying to take care of it.

546
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,901
Listen, I'm sorry. I...

547
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,101
I know when mom was sick, I know you said

548
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,702
I needed to come out, but mom said I didn't.

549
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,076
Listen, we've done that. Mom's dead.

550
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:24,375
I'm not gonna baby you about it.

551
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,383
I'm talking about right now. I'm in Vietnam and my dog is sick.

552
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,381
And you know what? Carol warned me.

553
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,249
This is so fucking typical of you.

554
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,718
I'm sorry to get so heated.

555
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,851
I know you're trying. It's scary being so far away.

556
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,953
Yeah, well, you can trust me, okay?

557
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,053
I know.

558
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,162
How...

559
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,233
How are you doing? Huh, man?

560
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,294
I'm fine.

561
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:49,995
Fine.

562
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:51,739
- Good. - what's going on?

563
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,641
Carol wants me to ask about the dog house,

564
00:36:54,642 --> 00:36:55,911
if that even matters now.

565
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:58,979
Can the pool overflow?

566
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,579
Yes, the pool can fucking overflow!

567
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,313
What the fuck's going on over there?

568
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,218
- It's raining. - "Have a great vacation."

569
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,688
"Thank you. Take care of my house and dog."

570
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:07,985
"Is he dead? Sorry."

571
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,219
You know what? I asked you a question.

572
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,523
"Can the pool overflow?" Fuck you!

573
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:53,727


574
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:14,879


575
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:22,966
There's a rugged road on the prairie.

576
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:29,300
Stretchin' all across the last frontier.

577
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:34,043
There a stranger strives solitary.

578
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:41,383
Blessed is the lonesome pioneer.

579
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,412
Roll on, roll on, roll on.

580
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,822
Night birds are flyin'.

581
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,454
Come on, the light is gone.

582
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,691
Hope's slowly dyin'.

583
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:59,168
Tell me how you come ridin' through.

584
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,663
Can I get four beers?

585
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,208
Are you Roger?

586
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,268
I'm Gina,

587
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,671
Florence's friend.

588
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,583
I've heard a lot about you.

589
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,078
Do you wanna come join our table?

590
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,921
No, I think I'll stay here. Maybe later.

591
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,452
Isn't she beautiful?

592
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,934
She's so ultra-sexy and hot up there.

593
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,828
What's that look?

594
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:36,864
You're so quiet.

595
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,411
I'm thinking of a letter I'm gonna write.

596
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,971
I hear you don't drive.

597
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,011
Did you ever drive?

598
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,184
I grew up here, I drove then.

599
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,613
I moved to New York and I stopped.

600
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,225
It was really nice meeting you.

601
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:01,731
Gainin' steady till this round is won.

602
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:06,202
On the long and lonely road to kingdom come.

603
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:11,971
People far below chasin' pleasures.

604
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:17,706
Offer him directions on the run.

605
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:23,549
Prophets on the path offer treasures.

606
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,385
And though he's mighty hungry he takes none.

607
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:34,990
Roll on, roll on, roll on.

608
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,226
Night birds are flyin'.

609
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:40,896
Come on, the light is gone.

610
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,871
Hope's slowly dyin'.

611
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:04,883


612
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,228
People don't call on my birthday anymore.

613
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:13,090
I guess I don't call people on their birthdays,

614
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:14,099
so why should they call me?

615
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:16,936
I didn't call you. When's yours?

616
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:17,996
November.

617
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,343
That's right. I'll call you this year.

618
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,906
We're taking her to this side.

619
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,151
Laughing already demonstrates appreciation.

620
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,883
The applause seems superfluous.

621
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,116
And also, it's like, just treat the restaurant

622
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,287
like it's your living room, guy.

623
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:42,865
I'm weirdly on tonight.

624
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,195
Should we order?

625
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,693
Maybe I should've invited Florence.

626
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,395
Or I should've had a party.

627
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:51,806
Birthdays are hard, man.

628
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,067
It's weird aging, right?

629
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,410
- It's like, "what the fuck is going on?" - I know.

630
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,210
Youth is wasted on the young.

631
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,217
I'd go further. I'd go,

632
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,809
"life is wasted on

633
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,016
"people."

634
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,318
Should I invite her?

635
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,723
It doesn't have to mean anything.

636
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,284
I don't wanna set up a series of expectations with her.

637
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,497
What do you think?

638
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,828
Yeah, if you want.

639
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,729
I guess I could call her.

640
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,667
Okay, then we should wait to order.

641
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,228
Maybe it'd be good. Do you care?

642
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:23,432
- No, no. - It's a different dynamic.

643
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:25,668
- Yeah. - She lives near here. I'll see if she's around.

644
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,071
She probably has other plans.

645
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,375
I won't get into it being my birthday.

646
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,436
She's young.

647
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,316
Thank you.

648
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,486
Thank you.

649
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,090
Thanks.

650
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,140
I don't find a lot of girls in LA attractive.

651
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,539
- Do you? - I do, yeah.

652
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,202
I said I don't.

653
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,302
Oh, I do.

654
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,142
She isn't as pretty as Beth,

655
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,648
or her face is, but she's bigger.

656
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:08,376
Not fat.

657
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,751
I find it sexy, but you'll see.

658
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,784
I never found Beth as beautiful as everyone else did.

659
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,717
She was my girlfriend.

660
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:17,954
Years ago.

661
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,689
I didn't think you'd take offense.

662
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,492
Well, you like racist Portuguese women.

663
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,829
She made one remark, and it's a cultural thing.

664
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,096
I mean, by our standards, Fabula's mother is a bigot.

665
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,697
- I know you never liked Fabula. - Florence is...

666
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,036
If you worked in an office with her,

667
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,701
you'd definitely develop a crush on her,

668
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,870
but outside the office,

669
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,709
you'd start to wonder if she was as cute as you'd imagined.

670
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,408
I'm just saying, you know,

671
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,451
Fabula is a lot less possessive than she used to be.

672
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:42,712
You'd like her more now.

673
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,081
Can I get another Scotch?

674
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,554
That's the busboy.

675
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,990
Fine, can I get another fork? This one has some food on it.

676
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,824
Fabula never got you.

677
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,760
She thought she'd bagged some fancy British guy

678
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,492
rather than just Ivan.

679
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,124
I know she helped you with the addiction and everything,

680
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,793
but you're over that now.

681
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,461
We have to find you someone.

682
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,366
It's too bad neither of us are the type to go whoring.

683
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:05,430
Is that her?

684
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,237
- Hi. -Hi.

685
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,281
This is Ivan.

686
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:16,717
- Hello. - It's nice to meet you.

687
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,550
- Hi. Hello. - Hi.

688
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,250
- Sorry. - Sorry.

689
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,189
I'll be right back.

690
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,558
- Hello? - Beth.

691
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:32,991
What?

692
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,393
Beth?

693
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:35,694
Who?

694
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,697
Is this a child?

695
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,599
Yes.

696
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,342
Is your mom there?

697
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,445
Who is this?

698
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,709
Roger.

699
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:46,772
Miller?

700
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,709
Roger.

701
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,515
Mom, it's Miller!

702
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:54,883
- Hello? - Beth.

703
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:56,751
Who's this?

704
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,021
Roger.

705
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,187
Hi.

706
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,319
What are you doing?

707
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,897
I'm sewing Charles' pants.

708
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,560
Is Charles your son?

709
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,894
Yeah. Hot stuff.

710
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:12,073
Are you sewing his Flash suit?

711
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,269
Is he the devil or the flash? Did he say?

712
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,212
How's the rest of your week looking?

713
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,051
- What'd you do with her? - She's in the bathroom.

714
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,359
You see what I mean about working in an office?

715
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,450
Where'd you go?

716
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:31,551
I called Beth.

717
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,994
- Really? - Come on, I mean, beth is a part of my life.

718
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,053
She's...

719
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:40,091
I don't believe that things happen for a reason, but maybe

720
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,400
me being out here at this particular time,

721
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,742
It's happening for a reason.

722
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:52,975
I cannot believe you still have this.

723
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,211
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. And I got you this.

724
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,150
"The Magic Marker. Live!" Man, look at Beller.

725
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,521
How is Lenny?

726
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,624
Lenny not so good.

727
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,159
You've got a bit of a mullet going on there.

728
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,697
No, I think that's a shadow.

729
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,289
You're trying so hard to look casual.

730
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,631
Happy birthday to you.

731
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,898
No, don't have them do that. Don't.

732
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,940
Happy birthday to you.

733
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,133
Don't.

734
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,641
You're such a fucking asshole.

735
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,699
Roger, relax.

736
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,905
You know I hate this shit. Will you stop? No...

737
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,438
Okay?

738
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,212
Sit on my dick, asshole!

739
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:34,783
And many more.

740
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,651
What the fuck, right?

741
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,129
- Well, he just got out of a mental hospital. - Right.

742
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,157
What? Really?

743
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,967
I mean, who does that? Gets the waiters.

744
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,239
I'm not one of these preening LA people

745
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,036
who likes everything to be about them.

746
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,806
I'm not some dickhead who does karaoke at the Farmers' Market

747
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:59,272
and hosts a running charades game every friday night,

748
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,475
and swing dances.

749
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:02,774
What?

750
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,821
You told Ivan to sit on your dick.

751
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,648
- Did I? - Yeah.

752
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,356
What the hell does that mean?

753
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:13,555
I don't know.

754
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:18,924
Okay.

755
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:20,892
Now,

756
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,096
Happy birthday.

757
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,673
Great.

758
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:31,873
So, I got the witch.

759
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:33,841
Thanks.

760
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,407
I made a snap judgment.

761
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,976
If you'd rather the devil, you can switch it out.

762
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,386
No, I'm happy with the witch.

763
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,525
You're right, these are too old for your niece.

764
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:47,691
I'm impressed by you.

765
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:49,958
In what way?

766
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,159
I don't know.

767
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,567
I mean, you seem really fine doing nothing.

768
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,740
It's like you don't feel all that

769
00:47:55,741 --> 00:47:57,971
bullshit pressure to be successful.

770
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,107
I mean, by other people's standards.

771
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,035
I'm...

772
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:07,906
You know, I almost had a record deal when I got out of college.

773
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,478
I haven't done nothing.

774
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,145
Cool.

775
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,950
I want to be doing nothing.

776
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:14,615
I'm doing nothing deliberately.

777
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,090
That's what I'm saying.

778
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,525
I don't know that I could do nothing

779
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,324
and be that cool with everything.

780
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,860
Well, there's so much crap out there.

781
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,531
Mahler's not at home.

782
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,870
You could stay over.

783
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:33,836
Wink-wink.

784
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:38,908
I'm not supposed to...

785
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,376
I try not to...

786
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,014
But, fuck it. Yeah, okay.

787
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:55,793
Ivan's nice.

788
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,665
Is he your best friend?

789
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,068
Yeah, I guess so.

790
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,500
I lost Ivan there for a few years

791
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,602
to this racist he met in rehab.

792
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,947
But their marriage is ending, which is good for him,

793
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,077
and me, to be honest.

794
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:18,143
Good.

795
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,245
You probably wouldn't believe this,

796
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,881
but in college we all looked up to him.

797
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,354
He was from England

798
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,328
and he used to be really handsome and stylish

799
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:28,455
- and kind of great. - I can believe that.

800
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,898
Ivan and I call each other "man," but it's meant as a joke.

801
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,727
It's the kind of thing we wouldn't say, 'cause...

802
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,271
It's our imitation of other people.

803
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,968
I know what that's like.

804
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,066
This friend of mine, Marnie, and me,

805
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,000
We went...

806
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:48,778
We went to this cheesy bar in Hollywood.

807
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:51,811
And we just thought,

808
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,879
"Let's pretend to be these slutty girls

809
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,424
"who are looking to get picked up,

810
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,891
"even though we're not."

811
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,958
And we end up talking to these two frat guys,

812
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:02,760
but, like, 30.

813
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,758
And they were all into their bodies

814
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,896
and cologned, very well-groomed.

815
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:13,972
And we ended up going back to one of their places.

816
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:19,406
And I think one of them was, like, almost retarded,

817
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:22,008
or else he was really drunk,

818
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:23,450
because he didn't make any sense.

819
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,786
And they got out this video camera.

820
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,252
And Marnie and I, we did this kind of striptease.

821
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,853
And it was crazy,

822
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,422
because we were still playing these girls,

823
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,902
but there we were, showing our breasts...

824
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,407
And then,

825
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,808
We ran out of there pretty fast. We were total freaks.

826
00:50:57,654 --> 00:50:59,212
You never have anything good to drink.

827
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,453
You know, that's like the stupidest story I've ever heard.

828
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,658
It's just...

829
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,320
Bye.

830
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,961
- What? - What is the point of that story?

831
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:30,349
Lots of really great, interesting people

832
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,978
have tried to kill themselves.

833
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,215
He tried to kill himself?

834
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,952
I don't think so. I'm just saying.

835
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:37,993
Come on, he's an asshole.

836
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,358
That's a defense.

837
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,659
He's not like us. He's...

838
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:45,633
You can tell that a lot of normal stuff is really hard for him.

839
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:46,999
Like being nice?

840
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,332
I like him.

841
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,270
- Should I call him? - No!

842
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,432
I don't like how he treats you.

843
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,839
He acts like you work for him.

844
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,342
Well, I work for his brother.

845
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,336
I don't wanna be rude.

846
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:59,678
If you keep driving him places, I'll stop speaking to you.

847
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,310
Okay.

848
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:06,217
We think it's an autoimmune disorder.

849
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:11,158
This hospital, it has more experience with internal medicine.

850
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,753
I called, and they're expecting you.

851
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,593
You can't do it here?

852
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,633
I mean, you know him now.

853
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,067
I know, but he needs to get well.

854
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,229
- Thank you. Come on, Mahler. - I know the doctors there.

855
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,829
You'll be in good hands.

856
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,898
This is where we're going.

857
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,967
I got to pick Victor up from school in half an hour.

858
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:29,306
Can you ask Florence?

859
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,673
I'm trying not to call her.

860
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,307
I'm just going to hurt her feelings, man.

861
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,511
I'm trying not to do that to people anymore.

862
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:39,316
And I don't want to be asking anyone for a ride anymore, ever.

863
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,388
I just turned 41, I should be able to drive.

864
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,791
Why are you yelling at me?

865
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,062
What a pain in the ass.

866
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,256
Come on, come on.

867
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,997
Survival rate is about 50-50,

868
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,198
but hopefully with the right cocktail of drugs,

869
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:00,266
we'll be able to get it under control and keep him stable.

870
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,439
"Dear Hollywood Pet Taxi,

871
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,207
"you would think a vehicle made expressly

872
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,044
"for the transportation of animals

873
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,674
would have a soft floor.

874
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,276
You were given very high marks in the yellow pages.

875
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,048
My next letter, by the way.

876
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:13,783
The fact that the animals you transport

877
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,018
have no way of lodging a formal complaint,

878
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,526
except for a well-deserved bite of the hand of the abuser,

879
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,495
should make you that much more caring.

880
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:22,439
The sick ones, like Mahler, can

881
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,432
only look pityingly into your eyes

882
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,162
while you ignore their pleas.

883
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,261
I intend to copy the ASPCA.

884
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,033
Sincerely, Roger Greenberg."

885
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,707
I always felt bad about that night

886
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,650
after we played the Viper Room,

887
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,654
and you were there with your sister,

888
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,280
and I wanted to go to that party,

889
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,587
and you were tired and I let you go home.

890
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:50,648
What night was that?

891
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,092
You were with your sister.

892
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,256
Yeah, I don't... I don't remember that night.

893
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,526
I should have been straight with you 'cause

894
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,000
I originally got into music to meet girls,

895
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,969
and I think when we were playing around LA

896
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,299
and I was starting to get some attention...

897
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,839
From girls, yeah. No, I understand.

898
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,205
Yeah, but I wasn't clear with you

899
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,540
and I want to apologize for how I behaved,

900
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,240
'cause I kind of just let it end,

901
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:13,805
and left town and was uncommunicative. Yeah.

902
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,282
And I feel like I didn't even give you a reason...

903
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,411
Yeah, but, you know, I knew.

904
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:19,944
Well, I'm sorry.

905
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,114
It's okay. You know.

906
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:24,524
Like I said, I don't even remember that night.

907
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,427
You had bought a new mattress that afternoon.

908
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,689
Sounds plausible.

909
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,860
I mean, what was it, like, 15 years ago or something?

910
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,394
Yeah, you didn't like the Sealy, you thought it was too mushy.

911
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,006
We used to make that 1-800-Mattress joke,

912
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:42,567
"the extra 'S' for extra sex."

913
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,206
Okay. Okay.

914
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,716
We could've gotten married and had kids.

915
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,446
Yeah? Do you think?

916
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,155
I don't think we would've. Really.

917
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,224
I don't know, it was a big relationship for me.

918
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,334
So, you're a carpenter now?

919
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:08,496
Yeah. I was always good at making things, so...

920
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:09,560
Yeah?

921
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,967
Beth,

922
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,135
I made you that bed. Don't you remember?

923
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,102
It was why we were going to buy the mattress to begin with.

924
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:22,180
Yes, I do. I do. I do remember that. I'm sorry. Totally.

925
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,314
Go on.

926
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,548
I work out of a studio in Bushwick

927
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,648
that I share with a few other carpenters and that's

928
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,219
been pretty good.

929
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:32,591
It's political, though.

930
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:35,690
What else?

931
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:40,296
Recently, I had this thing where I couldn't move my legs, literally.

932
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,273
You know, but it was psychological.

933
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:46,737
God...

934
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,869
Yeah, so that took some time dealing with.

935
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,979
I think that brings us up to date.

936
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:55,944
Are you okay?

937
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:57,642
Yeah.

938
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,790
I just... I think I need to just let go, you know?

939
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,557
I had a shrink there who said,

940
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,228
"you only miss by 5%."

941
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,487
I'm not positive what it means,

942
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,932
but in most things, 95 is pretty good.

943
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,562
I had a shrink once who told me,

944
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,098
"you're of value."

945
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:23,475
It's stupid, but it always stayed with me.

946
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,108
You look really pretty.

947
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,045
Thanks.

948
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,413
My dog is sick.

949
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,513
Oh, yeah?

950
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:35,954
My mom is sick.

951
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:38,016
Phillip's dog, really, but I'm taking care of him.

952
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,392
He has an autoimmune disorder.

953
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,955
Since he got sick, I keep thinking I have something.

954
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,998
I'm sorry about your mom.

955
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,129
Yeah.

956
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,867
I'm glad you're feeling better.

957
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,039
I get horrible anxiety sometimes, still.

958
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,011
Yeah, that I remember.

959
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,810
Do you want to have dinner one night?

960
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:05,818
This week? 

961
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:06,916
Or next. I kind of meant...

962
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,250
Like, on a date.

963
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,494
No.

964
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:14,941
I mean, you know, 

965
00:57:14,942 --> 00:57:15,861
that's just a terrible idea.

966
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,399
No. I mean, you know, no.

967
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,228
Hello.

968
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,204
Shit, they just... they don't even...

969
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,664
She doesn't seem to...

970
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,470
She looks harried even though no one's here.

971
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,907
I'm just going to go get her.

972
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:30,172
I'm sure she'll be by.

973
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,174
Hi. Could you send our bill?

974
00:57:36,816 --> 00:57:37,816


975
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:48,287
What is going on? Okay.

976
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,991
Water. Water.

977
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,630
God.

978
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:54,727
Hello.

979
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,533
How is Lenny?

980
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,198
Lenny not so good.

981
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,341
Not too late to call, I hope.

982
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:03,401
No.

983
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:08,008
Watching Just My Luck with Lindsay Lohan on Starz.

984
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,244
How is it?

985
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:11,845
Kind of funny.

986
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:13,647
She's got charm.

987
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:15,813
All right.

988
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:19,352
So, I was thinking

989
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,059
we should maybe do something together again.

990
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:26,261
Write some songs.

991
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,495
Aren't you going back to New York?

992
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:30,567
Yeah, but...

993
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:34,334
If we got something going I could stay here, possibly.

994
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,401
I don't know if I've really got time, you know,

995
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:39,471
with the computer work and Victor.

996
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:41,881
Isn't it funny, don't you still think

997
00:58:41,882 --> 00:58:42,880
of yourself as a guitar player

998
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,783
even though you don't do it anymore?

999
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,913
No. No. No, I don't.

1000
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,287
You know, I've just hired this guy

1001
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,954
called Ezra to help with the company, so...

1002
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:57,362
It's just, you know, I've got to concentrate on that.

1003
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,696
Okay.

1004
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,338
I think I'm having a party tomorrow.

1005
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:04,999
Tomorrow?

1006
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:07,133
A pool party. So, come.

1007
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,438
Bring Victor.

1008
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:09,671
Pool party? Cool.

1009
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,444
After we hang up, I'm going to call some people.

1010
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,348
Okay, man. Listen, I'll see you tomorrow.

1011
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,451
All right. Bye.

1012
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:13,201
Do you want to see a bigfoot walk?

1013
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:17,076
Very famous footage of him doing this. He doesn't wear no shoes.

1014
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:19,274
Bigfoot.

1015
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:22,512
And there's lots of scientific evidence, my friend.

1016
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:29,054
Megan's husband wants to know,

1017
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,682
do you know what kind of tree that

1018
01:00:30,683 --> 01:00:32,424
skinny one with the yellow flowers is?

1019
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:33,519
No.

1020
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:36,087
I mean, I wouldn't even think to know something like that.

1021
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:38,292
Are you coming out? Victor wants to show you his dive.

1022
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,598
Is it okay? Is it a dud?

1023
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,399
I do this, I throw a party last minute,

1024
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,133
then I'm disappointed that no one can come.

1025
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,198
It's fine. We're having fun.

1026
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:47,537
I need to put together the chips

1027
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:51,068
and guac and creamsicles I bought.

1028
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:54,077
I got you iced tea and lemonade,

1029
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,459
but I didn't know the right proportions,

1030
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,311
so you'll have to make it.

1031
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,410
I see. Thanks.

1032
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,981
I guess I'll make an appearance.

1033
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,557
Are you pulling a Gatsby and watching the party from afar?

1034
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,829
I don't know that I need to document

1035
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:09,797
the reasons how this isn't like a Gatsby.

1036
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,896
Marlon and Peggy are really nice.

1037
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,766
I didn't even invite them, they just come here.

1038
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:15,986
It turns out they've got a son who

1039
01:01:15,987 --> 01:01:17,135
went to the same school as Victor.

1040
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:18,730
It's such a small world.

1041
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,036
Why is that news to you?

1042
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,303
It is a small world.

1043
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,937
I'm surprised we all don't run into each other more often.

1044
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,674
You and I went to school together.

1045
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:41,562
Hey, Rog.

1046
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:50,770
Hi, this is Florence.

1047
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,206
I'm sorry to be calling, but I wanted to check and see how...

1048
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:54,265
Hello?

1049
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,834
Oh, I wanted to check and see how Mahler is.

1050
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,540
We had to move him to another vet.

1051
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:00,047
Really?

1052
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:02,983
Yeah, they do better with internal medicine there.

1053
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,041
I was going to call you, but...

1054
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,350
Is he okay? What did they say?

1055
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:07,821
I thought it was sciatica.

1056
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:09,517
Can you...

1057
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:10,581
Please.

1058
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:12,316
Please.

1059
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,097
I'd like to see him at the hospital,

1060
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:17,530
if you can give me the information.

1061
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,260
We don't have to see each other. We can go at different times.

1062
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:27,507
I like the old vet better.

1063
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,387
Gina told me it's nice to leave them

1064
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,119
something that smells like you.

1065
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:49,728
Sometimes I think he's a human in a dog costume.

1066
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,738
Wait.

1067
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:01,998
I don't know any of this.

1068
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,732
I don't know Karen Dalton.

1069
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:08,436
Very cool. Thanks.

1070
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,549
You sure you don't know it? 

1071
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,172
No. No.

1072
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:12,406
Thanks. Thank you.

1073
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,005
You can tell me if you know it.

1074
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,448
I don't.

1075
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:18,143
Karen Dalton was,

1076
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:20,246
like, this homeless junkie in the '70s.

1077
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:23,684
You know, it's a woman with sandals.

1078
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:26,057
Maybe there's something you can sing on there.

1079
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,728
You like old things.

1080
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,027
A shrink said to me once,

1081
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,401
I have trouble living in the present, 

1082
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:33,466
so I linger on the past,

1083
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,938
because I felt like I never really

1084
01:04:34,939 --> 01:04:36,505
lived it in the first place, you know?

1085
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,406
Do you think you could love me?

1086
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:44,907
I don't know, Florence.

1087
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:52,879
I just get excited to see you, and then...

1088
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,724
I think I get worried it's gonna go too fast,

1089
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,317
so I say things to get a reaction.

1090
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,248
What?

1091
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,046
We got to stop this.

1092
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:24,334
Really? 

1093
01:05:24,335 --> 01:05:24,983
Yeah.

1094
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:26,612
You got to stop calling me.

1095
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,122
I've intentionally not called you.

1096
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,028
Even when I needed to call you, I didn't.

1097
01:05:30,029 --> 01:05:31,284
You know, I took a pet taxi.

1098
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,827
I haven't called you.

1099
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,294
You called me today.

1100
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,556
That was for Mahler.

1101
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,964
Come on, it wasn't for Mahler.

1102
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:40,935
Florence, take some responsibility.

1103
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:42,800
Don't put yourself in this kind of situation.

1104
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,431
What situation? I like seeing you.

1105
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,339
No, you don't. You don't like it.

1106
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:49,896
Why are we even having this conversation?

1107
01:05:49,897 --> 01:05:51,136
We're not really even dating,

1108
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,579
and we're seeing other people.

1109
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:54,673
I'm not seeing anyone.

1110
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,547
Neither am I, but I want to.

1111
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,631
Who? 

1112
01:05:57,632 --> 01:05:58,644
I don't know! Anyone.

1113
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:01,121
I'm doing nothing. I'm not tied to anyone.

1114
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,715
How many times do we have to go over it? Jesus, I...

1115
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:07,354
I should be with a divorced 38-year-old who has teenage kids

1116
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,591
and low expectations about life.

1117
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:12,031
I don't want to fucking do this anymore.

1118
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,159
God!

1119
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:52,210


1120
01:06:52,211 --> 01:06:52,802


1121
01:06:52,803 --> 01:06:53,677


1122
01:06:53,678 --> 01:06:54,841


1123
01:06:54,842 --> 01:06:56,011


1124
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,385


1125
01:06:57,386 --> 01:06:58,386


1126
01:06:59,006 --> 01:07:03,392


1127
01:07:06,145 --> 01:07:07,255


1128
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:08,256


1129
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:09,225


1130
01:07:09,256 --> 01:07:10,256


1131
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,549
Half a pill three times a day with food.

1132
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:42,647
The blood thinners, just at night. They're for the blood clots.

1133
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:45,249
And he'll get prednisone, which is a steroid,

1134
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:47,352
twice a day for three days,

1135
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,330
and then we'll bring him down to one-and-a-half a day

1136
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:50,797
and the blood thinners every other day.

1137
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:52,756
Okay?

1138
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:57,298
Hi, little Mahler baby.

1139
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,500
Tried Ivan, but he had a birthday party.

1140
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:04,169
I didn't want to cram him into a shitty pet taxi.

1141
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,304
Hi, baby.

1142
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:06,507
Thank you for doing this.

1143
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:07,708
I'm here for Mahler.

1144
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:12,085
Gina says I'm crazy to drive you anywhere.

1145
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:13,280
Right.

1146
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:14,645
Your credit card.

1147
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,185
$3,084?

1148
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:28,200
He seems better.

1149
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,365
Give me his pills and I'll mark

1150
01:08:29,366 --> 01:08:30,568
them for you, so you don't forget.

1151
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:37,977
Hi, you've reached the Greenbergs, please leave a message.

1152
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:40,641
If you put the pills in peanut butter, they go down easier.

1153
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:42,411
Roger, it's Phillip. Pick up.

1154
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:43,474
Pick up!

1155
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:44,838
Fuck it. 

1156
01:08:44,839 --> 01:08:46,914
I got a very weird message from Florence.

1157
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,923
She's thinking of quitting.

1158
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:50,322
What the fuck's going on over there?

1159
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:53,190
Did you do something that freaked her out?

1160
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:56,959
Do you know how hard it is to find an assistant I actually like?

1161
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,829
Jesus! I can't trust you with anyone.

1162
01:08:58,901 --> 01:08:59,744
How is Mahler? 

1163
01:08:59,745 --> 01:09:00,869
How is Mahler, by the way?

1164
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:03,769
Did you pick him up today? Call me.

1165
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:09,444
Are you cooking? You wanna make Jell-O?

1166
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:12,003
The vet said that the steroids might upset his stomach.

1167
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:15,881
I'll just... I'll cook this and then I'll go.

1168
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,413
Gonna make chicken, too?

1169
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,425
I can pick up a roast chicken at the market.

1170
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,927
He shouldn't have the skin, it's too rich.

1171
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,725
I can eat the skin.

1172
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,465
You wanna have chicken and rice with Mahler?

1173
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:33,707
You can walk to Ralphs, 

1174
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:34,867
it's three blocks from here.

1175
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:38,232
Okay, will you be here when I get back?

1176
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:39,899
Oh, my god.

1177
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:43,312
I'll go get the chicken, but I'm going

1178
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:44,810
to call you when I'm pulling up

1179
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,713
and I want you to come out and I want you to get it from me.

1180
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:57,853
Thank you. Listen, I'm sorry about my freak-out the other night.

1181
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,758
You know? I gotta try to not do that.

1182
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,160
I get abusive and I'm working on that.

1183
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:03,755
So, anyway, I apologize.

1184
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:04,958
Thank you.

1185
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,193
I mean, it's not just me.

1186
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:10,127
you do participate in it, too, though. 

1187
01:10:10,128 --> 01:10:11,296
I mean, don't you think?

1188
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,103
No, then you're not apologizing, you know. I'm...

1189
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,303
This isn't a good day for me. I'm gonna go.

1190
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,470
I'm apologizing for my side of it.

1191
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:18,604
That's not an apology.

1192
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:19,909
Well, apologizing is hard.

1193
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,176
No, it's not. Not for me.

1194
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,380
Well, it is for me. You know what,

1195
01:10:22,381 --> 01:10:23,445
Florence? You know what I think?

1196
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,612
I think you're transferring shit onto me.

1197
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:28,680
I think you're looking to me for the mental and physical abuse

1198
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:31,521
of your father, and sexual molestation, or whatever.

1199
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:32,788
I was not molested or whatever.

1200
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:34,552
Or whatever. He was withholding.

1201
01:10:34,553 --> 01:10:35,455
I'm right about that, right?

1202
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,197
I was not molested!

1203
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:39,759
I said "whatever."

1204
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:51,908
You have reached the voicemail of Gina.

1205
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:55,576
Gina, call me back when you get this, okay?

1206
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:58,415
Also, we have to be there at 7:00 in the morning,

1207
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:01,081
so you should pick me up at 6:30.

1208
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:22,140
Hands across the water.

1209
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:27,173
Heads across the sky.

1210
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:31,409
Admiral Halsey notified me.

1211
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,079
He had to have a berth or he couldn't get to sea.

1212
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,951
- Hey. - Hey.

1213
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,924
I thought you were Gina.

1214
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:45,763
No, it's me.

1215
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:48,462
Roger. This one's for me.

1216
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:49,663
What?

1217
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:51,228
I was talking to Mahler.

1218
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,036
Why are you calling me?

1219
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:55,235
I wanted to speak to you. You need some more granola?

1220
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,176
Or ice-cream sandwiches?

1221
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,308
Come on.

1222
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:03,977
I mean, are we seeing each other or not?

1223
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,520
Well, that's what I wanna talk about.

1224
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,601
I don't know, I mean, 

1225
01:12:07,602 --> 01:12:09,250
I'm leaving in like a week.

1226
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,124
Hurt people, hurt people.

1227
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:14,037
"Hurt people, hurt people"?

1228
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,992
Hurt people, hurt people.

1229
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:19,125
It's something a singing coach of mine told me.

1230
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,160
Shit!

1231
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:23,397
Sorry. Is somebody there?

1232
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:24,496
No.

1233
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,408
I just spilled my champagne. Forget it.

1234
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:31,139
You never fucked that guy who plays guitar with you?

1235
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:32,202
No!

1236
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,945
I don't want this to sound dramatic,

1237
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:38,453
and I wasn't gonna say anything, and Gina's taking me.

1238
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:41,454
I mean, it's not yours. It's...

1239
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,024
I found out a couple of days ago.

1240
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:49,294
I don't know, it's gotta be my ex's,

1241
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,595
because I'm six or seven weeks,

1242
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,333
And you and I have only just...

1243
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,571
and you used a condom.

1244
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:04,845
I didn't wanna tell you. I mean, it's weird.

1245
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,382
I've been pregnant this whole time.

1246
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:14,677
I made an appointment for a D&C.

1247
01:13:14,678 --> 01:13:17,790
I'm really sensitive to pain,

1248
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:20,127
so I asked for anesthesia.

1249
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:23,166
Sorry, I'm trying to get drunk now.

1250
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:24,888
I can't eat after 10:00.

1251
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:27,365
I'll take you to it.

1252
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:32,866
How's that gonna work? Am I gonna drive you to take me?

1253
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:42,445
Can you turn it down? I'm sorry.

1254
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,185
My head is killing me.

1255
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,051
No, it's fine. Don't worry.

1256
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:51,803
It's your day, or...

1257
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:53,260
You know what I mean.

1258
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:08,075
We'll be here when you get out.

1259
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,008
Okay. Thanks.

1260
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:14,306
Don't be nervous.

1261
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:18,777
I just don't know what I'm doing with my life.

1262
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:20,946
You're of value.

1263
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,355
I know that. You don't have to say that.

1264
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,595
We could get her some flowers.

1265
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:37,147
I thought since she couldn't eat,

1266
01:14:37,148 --> 01:14:39,138
she might be hungry when it's over.

1267
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:48,775
Here.

1268
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:55,951
Well, when you're ready.

1269
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:58,151
Thanks.

1270
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:02,962
Could we go?

1271
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:06,659
They apparently won't let us go until you pee.

1272
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:11,768
I don't have to.

1273
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:16,833
Maybe when you get to the bathroom, you'll feel like it.

1274
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:20,042
I need to lie here for a little longer.

1275
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,314
But you'll probably be more comfortable lying at home.

1276
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:25,319
Let her sleep, man.

1277
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:30,215
You like me so much more than you think you do.

1278
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,093
Okay.

1279
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:41,792
Wish it wasn't too late to get my medical degree.

1280
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,565
It's not too late.

1281
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:45,402
I'd be over 50 by the time I graduated.

1282
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:47,374
What is it? Four years, right?

1283
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:50,202
Yeah, but I know myself. 

1284
01:15:50,203 --> 01:15:51,902
I'd procrastinate, take time off eight years at best.

1285
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,775
Who's gonna hire a 49...

1286
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:58,478
Let's just call it 50. A 50-year-old vet?

1287
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,516
I'm confused. Are you going to vet

1288
01:16:00,517 --> 01:16:02,422
school or regular medical school?

1289
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:05,483
Neither, clearly.

1290
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:09,590
I have to get back for Mahler's pills.

1291
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:14,700
It's a stupid rule. I mean, what does

1292
01:16:14,701 --> 01:16:15,766
peeing have to do with anything?

1293
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:17,862
Fabula makes this rice dish with pineapples and raisins.

1294
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,908
It's really delicious.

1295
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,067
I think you'll find lots of girls

1296
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,167
who'll be able to make that dish.

1297
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,712
No, no, no. This is a Brazilian specialty.

1298
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,769
Still.

1299
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:27,775
Are you guys Florence's friends?

1300
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,077
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1301
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:32,177
Okay. She's sleeping and she wants to stay the night.

1302
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:33,743
Did she pee?

1303
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:35,918
You wanna come in, watch a video?

1304
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:37,652
No, I should get going.

1305
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:38,784
Where?

1306
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,420
I think I'll go back to the motel, take a nap.

1307
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:42,929
Didn't sleep too well last night.

1308
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:45,125
I'm leaving in like a week.

1309
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,293
We'll hang out some more, don't worry.

1310
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:50,669
You're sure it's okay I left? She might wake up and be scared.

1311
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:53,105
She'll be fine. The nurse seemed nice.

1312
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:54,938
-I had to get back for Mahler. -I understand.

1313
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,443
No, I know. I'm not explaining myself to you.

1314
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:58,103
-I'm just saying.  -You're just saying, right?

1315
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,978
-Come on, one drink.  -No, I really gotta go.

1316
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:02,107
Okay.

1317
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:08,822
I appreciate your friendship.

1318
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,360
Can I ask, what do people say about me?

1319
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,261
Like, negative things I wouldn't know.

1320
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:21,393
Let me go, man.

1321
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,871
Come on, I'm sure people must trash me when I'm not around.

1322
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:26,799
They don't trash you.

1323
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,638
Okay, what criticisms do they have?

1324
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:31,545
I don't know.

1325
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:34,440
I'd say the biggest criticism they have is that

1326
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:36,882
you have trouble making fun of yourself.

1327
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:39,114
Really?

1328
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:43,256
That's incredible. I'm the funniest person I know.

1329
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,589
Well, not about yourself.

1330
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,992
- Really?  - That's what people say.

1331
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:48,359
I wouldn't get too worried about it.

1332
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:49,988
These things aren't difficult to fix.

1333
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:51,457
Right.

1334
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:55,153
People say they think you lie about

1335
01:17:55,154 --> 01:17:57,872
things you don't need to lie about,

1336
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:00,237
That you don't make any effort,

1337
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:01,468
That you're a bit of a prince.

1338
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:05,274
Who says? Who are these people? That's just totally insane.

1339
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:06,837
I'm just telling you what I've heard.

1340
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:08,446
If anything I'd say I'm too honest,

1341
01:18:08,447 --> 01:18:09,042
don't you think?

1342
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:11,847
I mean, I'm pretty upfront with...

1343
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,785
No effort?

1344
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:17,592
I'm making my brother's family a doghouse.

1345
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:19,388
You know, I brought my tool kit out from New York.

1346
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:20,792
They had to check my bag because of that.

1347
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:23,490
I always do carry-on. I have calluses.

1348
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:26,325
Does Beller say this?

1349
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:28,631
I think Beller said it, yeah. And others, too.

1350
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,537
Johno, maybe once, and Anna.

1351
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,971
-That's funny.  -Yeah.

1352
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:37,974
Completely wrong, but funny.

1353
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:41,846
All right.

1354
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,061
Hello?

1355
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,736
- Sara? - There's the strange man

1356
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:06,797
who's been sleeping in my room.

1357
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:10,406
-Oh, this is Muriel.  -Hey.

1358
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:12,843
I heard you killed our dog.

1359
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:15,576
No. No, no, he's all better.

1360
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,345
We brought him back yesterday.

1361
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:20,946
Well, where is he? Mahler!

1362
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:24,348
Mahler? Mahler!

1363
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:28,129
We leave for Australia tomorrow morning.

1364
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,488
Isn't that like a 20-hour flight?

1365
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,524
No, it's 14.

1366
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:36,126
So that's, like, seven movies.

1367
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:39,665
Yeah.

1368
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:44,439
Hello?

1369
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:47,573
Party of 20-year-olds has suddenly happened at my house.

1370
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:48,946
Hey, man.

1371
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:50,245
Hey, man.

1372
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:51,307
How was your nap?

1373
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:52,375
Yeah, it was fine.

1374
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:53,512
Where are you?

1375
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:56,489
I'm having dinner with my family.

1376
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:58,355
- Your parents?  - No.

1377
01:19:58,426 --> 01:19:59,518
My other family.

1378
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:00,959
Fabula.

1379
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:03,356
Do you want me to come over there?

1380
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,865
No! it's okay.

1381
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:07,765
Just don't do anything.

1382
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:09,201
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

1383
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:10,738
You should come here after.

1384
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,034
I really gotta go.

1385
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:13,699
Okay. Call you later.

1386
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:20,877
Hey! He just got out of the hospital.

1387
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:22,109
I'm sorry.

1388
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:23,845
You know, don't give him beer.

1389
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:24,977
I'm so sorry.

1390
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,255
He's got an autoimmune disorder, all right?

1391
01:20:26,256 --> 01:20:27,180
Mahler.

1392
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:28,813
-I didn't know.  -Mahler.

1393
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,088
Mahler.

1394
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,666
Hey, man, you got a cool place.

1395
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,762
Thanks. It's not totally mine, but...

1396
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:19,807
Yeah, what do you do?

1397
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,708
I'm kind of doing nothing for a while.

1398
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,705
Is that coke?

1399
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:25,905
Yup.

1400
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:27,608
I'd heard coke was in again.

1401
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:29,274
Yeah, you want some?

1402
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:38,488
-I'm Rich.  -Roger Greenberg.

1403
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,953
Is it okay to mix coke and zoloft?

1404
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,512
Yeah, totally.

1405
01:21:43,513 --> 01:21:45,488
I haven't done this in, like, 15 years.

1406
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:48,185
Since college, or since a couple of years out.

1407
01:21:48,186 --> 01:21:50,366
It's very unlike me.

1408
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:56,707
I actually hate coke.

1409
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:58,225
I hate it politically

1410
01:21:58,226 --> 01:21:59,545
and I hate how it makes me feel.

1411
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:00,911
But when it's done, I may have to

1412
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:03,507
kill one of you out of sheer frustration.

1413
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,917
I'm gonna change the record. We need better coke music.

1414
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:07,887
Oh, yeah. Put on some Korn.

1415
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,184
I got the perfect thing.

1416
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:16,196
- Hello? - Hey, man.

1417
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:17,424
Hey, man.

1418
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:19,023
I just did a line.

1419
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,500
I think the last time I did coke was with you.

1420
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,833
It was just a line, but I feel really wired.

1421
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:26,068
I guess my tolerance is less.

1422
01:22:26,141 --> 01:22:27,233
Okay.

1423
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:28,833
You done with dinner?

1424
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:30,400
No, we're still eating.

1425
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:32,412
Put on Acidc!

1426
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,572
You sure you don't want me there?

1427
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:34,672
Yeah.

1428
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:35,738
I've gotta go, man.

1429
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:37,842
I almost feel like I can get in a car and drive.

1430
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:39,546
Don't do that.

1431
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:41,552
You gotta come here when you're done.

1432
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:42,749
Oh, dude! come on!

1433
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:44,451
Fuck off, Jerry!

1434
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:45,857
Tonight's not good, man.

1435
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:47,394
Man, you gotta come!

1436
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:49,791
I can't believe you lied to me about your dinner.

1437
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,024
Put on Acidc!

1438
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:52,623
It's actually a pretty fun party.

1439
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:54,032
Man, I can't!

1440
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:55,399
All right. I got to go.

1441
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,938
We wanna hear Acidc!

1442
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,510
Don't, okay?

1443
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:07,571
Come on! Duran Duran's great coke music. Give it a chance.

1444
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,640
Let's maybe not keep saying coke in every sentence.

1445
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:11,954
I read an article.

1446
01:23:11,955 --> 01:23:13,316
Aren't you guys all just fucking on the internet?

1447
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:14,685
Not all of us.

1448
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:16,018
But some?

1449
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:17,422
I guess some.

1450
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,471
Yeah, I think Paige has a site,

1451
01:23:19,472 --> 01:23:21,451
but it's more art than porn.

1452
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:23,053
They shot a skin flick on my campus,

1453
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:24,421
a couple guys and some townies,

1454
01:23:24,422 --> 01:23:25,497
-and they acted in it.  -Sick.

1455
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:27,228
Can't we put on some Korn?

1456
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,793
No, we can't put on fucking Korn. Jesus!

1457
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,399
You guys smoke coke at all?

1458
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:34,772
-I don't.  -I have, once or twice.

1459
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,208
I might get back into drugs.

1460
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,142
I've got a vicodin, if you want.

1461
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:41,611
I could use that, actually.

1462
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,116
You want a neck massage?

1463
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,785
Okay. Normally, I'd say no

1464
01:23:46,786 --> 01:23:49,081
because I'm a little OCD, but...

1465
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:52,284
Okay.

1466
01:23:57,665 --> 01:23:59,189
That's great.

1467
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:01,626
Are you kids really different from me?

1468
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,261
I mean, do the movies, and the ipods,

1469
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:04,930
and the facility with myspace pages,

1470
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:06,064
make you guys really different?

1471
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:07,472
I don't know.

1472
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,908
Every article I read seems to be saying that.

1473
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:14,039
Definitely feel it. Good coke.

1474
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:17,411
-What?  -Nothing.

1475
01:24:17,485 --> 01:24:18,747
You're funny.

1476
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:21,616
You're mean.

1477
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,851
The thing about you kids is you're all kind of insensitive.

1478
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:26,393
I'm glad I grew up when I did,

1479
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:27,985
'cause your parents were too perfect at parenting,

1480
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,999
all that baby Mozart and Dan Zanes songs.

1481
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:35,298
You're so sincere and interested in things.

1482
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,271
There's a confidence in you guys that's horrifying.

1483
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:40,864
You're all ADD and carpal tunnel.

1484
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:41,567
You wouldn't know agoraphobia 

1485
01:24:41,942 --> 01:24:42,967
if it bit you in the ass,

1486
01:24:43,044 --> 01:24:44,375
and it makes you mean.

1487
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:46,038
You say things to someone like me,

1488
01:24:46,114 --> 01:24:49,515
who's older and smarter, with this blithe air.

1489
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:51,313
I'm freaked out by you kids.

1490
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:55,712
I hope I die before I end up meeting

1491
01:24:55,713 --> 01:24:57,455
one of you in a job interview.

1492
01:24:58,126 --> 01:24:59,150
Fuck or fight?

1493
01:24:59,227 --> 01:25:00,216
What?

1494
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:01,762
Fuck or fight?

1495
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:04,056
What are you fighting against?

1496
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:05,599
What do you got?

1497
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:09,127
I don't have much.

1498
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:12,139
Then that's what I'm fighting against, not much.

1499
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:18,568
What the fuck? Rich, you asshole.

1500
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:20,637
I didn't do anything, man.

1501
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:21,840
Sorry.

1502
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:26,945
Get off the stereo. I was listening to that.

1503
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:29,785
Where's the Duran Duran?

1504
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,086
"Where's the Duran Duran?"

1505
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:33,150
Careful, those are my brother's records.

1506
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:34,320
"Those are my brother's records."

1507
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:35,419
Fuck off.

1508
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:37,388
Jesus!

1509
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:38,793
There's something in the pool!

1510
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:47,536
Don't feed him. No, don't feed him!

1511
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:50,636
Mahler, drop it! Mahler, drop it.

1512
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:53,545
Mahler, drop it. Drop it. Drop it.

1513
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:05,816
God, what is it?

1514
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:09,660
I think it's a bird or an opossum, or something.

1515
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:12,928
It's a... I think we've had one of these before.

1516
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:27,512
Holy shit!

1517
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:47,659
All right. It's coming to get your ass!

1518
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:51,704
I'm sorry your dog has AIDS.

1519
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:55,771
He doesn't have AIDS. It's an autoimmune disorder.

1520
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:31,577
How is Lenny?

1521
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:33,011
Hey, man.

1522
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:36,948
Hey, you okay, man? Is that pot? Where did you get that?

1523
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:39,486
- You want a puff? - No, man, I quit. You know that.

1524
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:41,920
Okay, man. Okay.

1525
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:46,188
Isn't this weird? So, how'd it go?

1526
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,195
- Fine. - And?

1527
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,855
I think

1528
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,562
- We're gonna have another try. - You're shitting me.

1529
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:53,760
Please don't make this hard for me.

1530
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:54,893
Oh, god, man.

1531
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:56,561
Don't give in.

1532
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:59,732
I know it's the harder, more painful decision to stay free,

1533
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:01,604
But that's what adulthood is.

1534
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:02,973
I mean, I could just stay with Florence

1535
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:04,671
because it's easy, but I don't want easy.

1536
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:06,771
You've been dating Florence for a month.

1537
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:09,214
I've been married for 10 years with a child.

1538
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,478
Don't tell me about adulthood.

1539
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:11,643
We're not dating, exactly.

1540
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:12,811
That's my point!

1541
01:28:12,887 --> 01:28:15,082
Hey, you're shouting at me.

1542
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:17,854
It's been a really hard time for me,

1543
01:28:17,855 --> 01:28:20,253
Roger. I mean, I miss my family.

1544
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:22,229
I feel like

1545
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:24,691
all the hard work I've done over the years,

1546
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,199
kicking the drugs, being a dad,

1547
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:28,326
I feel like it's all slipping away from me.

1548
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:29,893
It's not going away.

1549
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:32,371
It's transforming. You're going through something, which means...

1550
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,375
I don't think you understand what it's been like for me out here,

1551
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:38,708
How the life I'd hoped for...

1552
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:44,883
It's huge to finally embrace the life you never planned on.

1553
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,817
I wanted to make that record.

1554
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:52,494
We never would've survived at a major

1555
01:28:52,495 --> 01:28:53,793
label with those restrictions.

1556
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:54,850
How the fuck do you know?

1557
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:56,294
Because that's not how the world works.

1558
01:28:56,364 --> 01:28:59,492
What could you possibly know about how the world works?

1559
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:02,232
Listen, man, I think you're playing out some old family dynamic here...

1560
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,895
Apropos of what we were saying before

1561
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:05,461
about what people say about us?

1562
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,303
People feel you hold on to petty resentments.

1563
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,605
You asked me what people say about you.

1564
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:11,542
- I don't want to know. - Yeah, well, you should know.

1565
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:13,170
People think you play the victim.

1566
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:14,680
And I don't mean this in a bad way,

1567
01:29:14,749 --> 01:29:16,114
But you let people feel sorry for you

1568
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,742
when you're really just protecting your own narcissism.

1569
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:18,808
I don't want to know!

1570
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:21,821
Well, that's why I didn't want to be in a fucking band with you!

1571
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:24,949
Because you won't acknowledge your own shit.

1572
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:28,652
And you were fucked up all the time!

1573
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:31,923
What do you want me to say? 

1574
01:29:31,998 --> 01:29:32,923
What do you want me to say?

1575
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,867
I had no idea that would be our only offer.

1576
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,198
I didn't think that I had the power to blow it.

1577
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:41,503
I thought that we were all just giving our two cents.

1578
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:44,170
Fuck, I didn't know I was gonna be

1579
01:29:44,245 --> 01:29:46,873
the one to make the band fall apart.

1580
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:50,384
You know, maybe, obviously, I would do it differently now!

1581
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:56,851
Of course I know what it's like to live a life I didn't plan on.

1582
01:29:56,924 --> 01:30:00,155
What the fuck do you think I'm doing right now?

1583
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:11,399
Florence told me you were in the hospital.

1584
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:16,438
I'd know, I understand about those things.

1585
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,479
You know, we could've talked about it,

1586
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:19,911
Maybe made each other feel better,

1587
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:23,417
but instead we never talk about anything good.

1588
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:34,160
This is a small thing,

1589
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:36,822
and it's probably boring for you,

1590
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:38,427
but it would've been nice if you'd

1591
01:30:38,428 --> 01:30:39,867
have made an effort to know Vic.

1592
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:40,992
Who's Vic?

1593
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:42,057
My son.

1594
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:45,299
Oh, Victor. I didn't recognize the diminutive.

1595
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:11,691
Hi, it's Florence. Leave a message.

1596
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:12,960
Florence.

1597
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:16,332
Florence, I'm calling to say I'm sorry

1598
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:18,668
You had to go through what you're going through.

1599
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:22,698
And Mahler's fine. He ate pizza.

1600
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:26,044
I'm leaving this in your voicemail, 

1601
01:31:26,779 --> 01:31:28,044
but it's really a letter.

1602
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:31,175
I get so angry about the world, you know?

1603
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,646
If I knew who to write a letter to

1604
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:36,417
about all the stupidity in the world, I'd do it.

1605
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:43,153
You're 25. I was just 27.

1606
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:48,000
You're brave. Young people are brave.

1607
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:51,768
When I was a kid, I was a leader

1608
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:54,069
and most of the kids always looked up to me.

1609
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:58,544
I thought I might go into space, you know, as an astronaut.

1610
01:31:58,713 --> 01:32:01,739
I can't even swim in the fucking pool.

1611
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:03,681
My brother's in Vietnam.

1612
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:06,242
We have the same parents. I can't blame that.

1613
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:11,921
I really love Phillip, 

1614
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:13,921
but I'm not supposed to be on his bed.

1615
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:19,260
I love my parents. I love Mahler.

1616
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:22,302
I miss my mom.

1617
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:27,099
I really like you.

1618
01:32:28,242 --> 01:32:32,178
I just hate how embarrassing it all is. I don't understand.

1619
01:32:32,446 --> 01:32:33,811
What happened to me?

1620
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:36,348
Where does experience go?

1621
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:40,879
Remember Charlie Sheen standing on his balcony in Wall Street?

1622
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:43,788
Did you see that movie? Saying, "who am I?"

1623
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:46,918
Phillip and I used to make so much fun of it.

1624
01:32:46,994 --> 01:32:49,087
I'm thinking, now, it wasn't so stupid.

1625
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,830
Somebody once said to me, 

1626
01:32:52,897 --> 01:32:54,830
"hurt people hurt people."

1627
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:59,331
It's kind of trite, but it stayed with me.

1628
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:03,901
Oh, man! That was you, like, a few days ago.

1629
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:06,538
I used to have a really good memory, too.

1630
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:10,175
Anyway, we do... I do hurt people.

1631
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:14,281
Hurt people.

1632
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:18,788
I think Ivan and I broke up.

1633
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:29,031
Florence, I really like you.

1634
01:33:30,471 --> 01:33:32,063
Love, Roger.

1635
01:33:56,197 --> 01:33:57,664
Assholes.

1636
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:05,899
Dicks.

1637
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:09,209
I don't understand why she did it.

1638
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:11,505
Good morning, sunshine.

1639
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:13,308
Holy shit!

1640
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:15,872
How you feeling, sunny?

1641
01:34:16,017 --> 01:34:17,575
What's "sunny"?

1642
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:20,687
We decided that's our name for you.

1643
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:22,951
I think I'm still drunk.

1644
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:33,129
They printed my letter about Pakistan.

1645
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,599
Cool.

1646
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:39,435
"Roger Greenberg. Hollywood, California."

1647
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:44,239
I mean, I've got no problem giving some guy a blowjob,

1648
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:47,769
but she has taken it to the extreme.

1649
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:49,743
Why do guys like to do that?

1650
01:34:49,744 --> 01:34:51,011
Come on you and spread it?

1651
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:53,553
- They don't all like it. - They do.

1652
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:56,522
No, they don't. You just like guys who do that.

1653
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:57,682
Fuck you!

1654
01:34:57,958 --> 01:35:00,722
You're really good with him. You have dogs?

1655
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:03,953
No, Florence showed me how to do it.

1656
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:07,891
Did you start an affair with Phillip's assistant?

1657
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,427
No.

1658
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:11,538
I'm jealous.

1659
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:15,666
- You should come to Australia with us.  - Yeah?

1660
01:35:15,667 --> 01:35:18,743
YThere's a great kinks song called Australia.

1661
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:22,772
Totally. You should totally come.

1662
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:25,177
Maybe I will.

1663
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:26,445
Okay.

1664
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,183
But you better hurry. 

1665
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:30,183
We gotta leave in, like, five minutes.

1666
01:35:40,434 --> 01:35:43,096
Fuck! What are we gonna do about Mahler?

1667
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:45,095
Oh, fuck.

1668
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:51,234
Can I ask you guys a favor?

1669
01:35:51,312 --> 01:35:52,180
Yeah. What's happening? 

1670
01:35:52,312 --> 01:35:53,780
How you doing? I'm Roger, by the way.

1671
01:35:53,848 --> 01:35:55,713
Marlon and Peggy. Sorry it's such a mess.

1672
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:56,977
Yeah, we're gonna go home.

1673
01:35:57,051 --> 01:35:58,951
Can you take Mahler until Wednesday?

1674
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:02,553
Yeah, sure. We love Mahler. Come here, baby.

1675
01:36:02,623 --> 01:36:03,783
Great.

1676
01:36:09,196 --> 01:36:10,857
No, wait a second.

1677
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:14,924
You know, run it by his nose.

1678
01:36:15,002 --> 01:36:16,469
Okay. No sweat.

1679
01:36:16,537 --> 01:36:20,337
Thanks, man. And he takes prednisone, which is a steroid,

1680
01:36:20,407 --> 01:36:22,705
twice a day for the next three days. I'll write this out.

1681
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,802
Also, there's an antibiotic and a blood thinner,

1682
01:36:24,879 --> 01:36:26,107
But I'll write it down for you.

1683
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:27,410
Let's go! We still have to get you a ticket. 

1684
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:28,410
What time is it?

1685
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:30,882
Come on! It's fucking peaceful, is what it is.

1686
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:33,044
- I love it. Did you see sharks last time? - Fuck!

1687
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:35,448
Okay.

1688
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:39,851
You know what really pisses me off, is fucking Lily.

1689
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:43,590
Once again. I still can't get over that. What a slut.

1690
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:45,798
Like, I'm thinking about it now,

1691
01:36:45,866 --> 01:36:47,731
and it's so much worse than I remembered.

1692
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,531
Now that I feel like, maybe I was drunk at the time.

1693
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:52,936
I've seen a great white, and there are the most amazing wrecks.

1694
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:54,872
I literally cannot wait.

1695
01:36:54,942 --> 01:36:56,603
I love that you're doing this.

1696
01:36:56,677 --> 01:36:57,974
Is this completely crazy?

1697
01:36:58,045 --> 01:36:59,307
No!

1698
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:01,678
I mean, it's what people do, right?

1699
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:03,717
You'll love Australia.

1700
01:37:03,784 --> 01:37:05,081
For some people, this is nothing.

1701
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:07,484
And who knows how much longer the reef's gonna be around?

1702
01:37:07,555 --> 01:37:10,285
There's this starfish that's killing the marine life.

1703
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:11,517
Roger, are you certified?

1704
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:12,684
To what?

1705
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:13,988
Dive.

1706
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,789
No, I don't really swim.

1707
01:37:23,704 --> 01:37:26,036
You can go look at whales while we dive.

1708
01:37:26,707 --> 01:37:28,504
Sunny will look at whales.

1709
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:31,977
Okay, you know what? You can cut out the sunny business.

1710
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:36,912
Oh, my god, look at this guy in these overalls and the clogs.

1711
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:38,246
I left my chapstick. Oh, my god.

1712
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:40,412
Are overalls back in now, or is he crazy?

1713
01:37:40,487 --> 01:37:43,456
No, I saw a bunch of people in overalls...

1714
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:56,301
Hey, will you check this out?

1715
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,701
What the fuck is that?

1716
01:37:57,771 --> 01:37:58,829
That is so weird.

1717
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:01,136
I know, right? It's so itchy. Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

1718
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:05,110
You know what? I'm supposed to get someone from the hospital.

1719
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:06,976
No, no, no. Hold it. Hey! hey, hold it!

1720
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:08,912
Can you open my door? No, you're our prisoner.

1721
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:11,383
- Exactly. - Come on, open the fucking door, please.

1722
01:38:11,452 --> 01:38:12,749
- Okay, fine. - Come on.

1723
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:14,720
- Roger, it's a rental. - Open it.

1724
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:16,415
Would you stop? Sara, open the fucking door!

1725
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:18,458
I'm trying. Stop pulling on it!

1726
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:20,724
You know, I can't go, I can't afford it

1727
01:38:20,794 --> 01:38:23,888
And I have to pick up my friend.

1728
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:25,828
Have a good time, all right?

1729
01:38:28,636 --> 01:38:29,762
Bye!

1730
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:16,472
I've got to get insurance. The anesthesia's so expensive.

1731
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:18,848
I'm such a baby about pain.

1732
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:23,055
And I stayed overnight.

1733
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:27,085
I'm glad your brother's coming back next week.

1734
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,152
I need to work more hours.

1735
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:38,532
Thanks.

1736
01:39:43,143 --> 01:39:45,441
I really picked my lip in my sleep,

1737
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:48,913
which was possibly about finding a pet in the canyons.

1738
01:39:50,351 --> 01:39:51,511
Do you,

1739
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:54,848
get the New York Times?

1740
01:39:54,922 --> 01:39:56,082
No.

1741
01:39:57,024 --> 01:39:59,857
It's good to get the paper. I'll pick you up one.

1742
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,121
Okay.

1743
01:40:03,097 --> 01:40:05,031
Did you get my message?

1744
01:40:05,099 --> 01:40:07,897
I haven't checked yet. What did you say?

1745
01:40:10,437 --> 01:40:13,895
I reassessed the movie Wall Street, among other things.

1746
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:16,667
I don't know it.

1747
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:22,473
I wasn't gonna give it to you 'cause

1748
01:40:22,474 --> 01:40:24,546
I was pissed, but you can open it.

1749
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:26,449
Happy birthday, again.

1750
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:28,746
Thanks.

1751
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:35,721
Now you have the set. Not that they're a set.

1752
01:40:37,998 --> 01:40:39,863
What about your niece?

1753
01:40:39,933 --> 01:40:42,595
Remember, the sticks are too old.

1754
01:40:42,669 --> 01:40:45,866
She's coming over this weekend. I framed her picture.

1755
01:40:53,847 --> 01:40:55,474
Do you have a tape-measure?

1756
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:58,074
I think there's a ruler in the desk drawer.

1757
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:08,218
Do you have a hammer?

1758
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:09,819
Maybe in there.

1759
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:11,922
Here?

1760
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:14,995
You want it on this wall, here?

1761
01:41:16,670 --> 01:41:17,762
Okay.

1762
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:24,236
Cool.

1763
01:41:25,379 --> 01:41:27,074
Like a professional.

1764
01:41:27,781 --> 01:41:29,806
Well, I am a professional.

1765
01:41:31,518 --> 01:41:33,383
I mean, I build things.

1766
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:46,092
I know you know I was in a hospital. I'm not hiding it.

1767
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:52,437
But it's not what defines me, you know?

1768
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:55,608
I understand.

1769
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:10,950
I want to listen to my message.

1770
01:42:15,729 --> 01:42:19,495
I'd had some to drink.

1771
01:42:33,747 --> 01:42:35,078
Gina.

1772
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:42,720
