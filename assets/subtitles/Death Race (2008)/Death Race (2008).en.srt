1
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,146
Damn it!

2
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:17,340
Rear armor?
Shot to hell!

3
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:20,628
You better drop back..

4
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:23,292
It's the last lap
We can win this.

5
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:25,379
Why don't the son of a bitch just die?

6
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:27,558
Oil

7
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,516
Out

8
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:32,045
Smoke!

9
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:33,907
Finished!

10
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:37,423
Give me the napalm!
-Nothing works!

11
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,364
Drop the tombstone, on my mark

12
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:46,564
Three...

13
00:02:47,978 --> 00:02:48,978
Two...

14
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:51,103
One...

15
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,757
Got you now, motherfucker

16
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:54,757
Mark!

17
00:02:57,705 --> 00:02:58,090
Shit!

18
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:00,494
Fuck!

19
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,277
Thats how you wanna do it?!
Okay!

20
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:21,068
He's still coming, our tank is exposed

21
00:03:22,714 --> 00:03:24,964
He got us, Frank. You have to drop back

22
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:27,859
It's a quarter mile to the line, I can make it.

23
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,244
Sayonara, Frankie

24
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,618
Punch out
I'm sorry

25
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:39,474
40 years...Longer than my marriage

26
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:44,859
Sounds like you're gonna miss this place
Still can't believe they closed it down

27
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:46,367
Just like that

28
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,454
The only thing I'm gonna miss
is my paycheck.

29
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,666
Well, it was an honest work
for honest men.

30
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:55,281
I got a family to feed.
Theres no work out there

31
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:58,089
I heard that they might be hiring, down at the docks

32
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,061
5 men, maybe

33
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:03,196
Hey.. thanks man
Thanks Jensen

34
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,621
Collect your final paycheck, and leave

35
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:21,756
The main gate will be locked in 15 minutes

36
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:30,112
Get ready to be ripped off boys

37
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:37,055
Collect your paychecks, and leave the premises in orderly manor
The main gate will be locked in 15 minutes

38
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:46,797
Cash or check?

39
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,076
Better make it cash.

40
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:51,749
Three hundred dollars..

41
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:55,086
I've worked 120 hours in the last two weeks.

42
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:56,086
Cash fee..Next!

43
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:57,260
Cash fee??

44
00:06:57,336 --> 00:06:59,702
You wanted cash? There's a fee.  You want check instead..?

45
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:02,318
Seeing as the company is out of business, not exactly.

46
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,328
You don't like it, there's the complaint box.

47
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:05,530
Next!

48
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,195
I never get it, self fulfilling prophecy

49
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:42,428
We're honest workers, we're just like you guys!

50
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:43,996
What the hell are you doing here?

51
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:56,747
Are you ok, Ross?

52
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:01,199
Hi honey.

53
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:02,526
Sorry I'm so late.

54
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:07,459
Nice day at work?

55
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,738
Yeah... Just fine.

56
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:15,479
Give me that shirt.

57
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:22,307
They called the riot police, it got ugly.
I don't deserve you.

58
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,894
You're a good man, Jensen Ames
And it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks, but me.

59
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:39,415
So 300 dollars, thats all they gave us

60
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:43,357
We'll make it last,
We always do.

61
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,685
I'm gonna start tomorrow

62
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:51,830
I think you're forgetting that I married you,
for your non-financial assets.

63
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:54,359
Did you now?

64
00:10:18,938 --> 00:10:20,064
Daddy's home

65
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,429
Is it you who's making all that noise?

66
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,487
What does little Piper want?
You want a story?

67
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:28,661
You know you won't understand it..

68
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:32,555
..But it'll be good practice for me.

69
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:41,710
What the hell..

70
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:44,884
Let's go crazy.

71
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,779
Something smells good

72
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:03,449
Honey!

73
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:05,382
Suzy!

74
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:28,962
Stay on the ground!

75
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:30,972
Stay where you are!

76
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:37,982
Don't move!

77
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:19,447
Get up against the wall.

78
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:56,771
Stop!

79
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:00,108
Prisoner, step back

80
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:11,655
Happy Holidays.

81
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,569
Good morning
Good morning, Warden

82
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,541
Good morning, Ma'am

83
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:54,936
There goes the baddest ass in the yard

84
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:56,859
Sounds like you in love, homie.

85
00:14:58,092 --> 00:14:59,457
I am.

86
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,818
Damn, I had to wake up for this..

87
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,367
Is it my imagination, or is
this shit getting worse?

88
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:22,137
Whats this supposed to be?

89
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:24,022
Oatmeal

90
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:26,108
I think..

91
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:28,282
How do you fuck up oatmeal?

92
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:32,696
Who's the new guy?

93
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,071
Jensen Ames
The driver?

94
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,437
Never heard of him.

95
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:41,052
Oh yeah. I saw him race years ago. He was good.

96
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,062
He did some time upstate.

97
00:15:43,505 --> 00:15:44,947
Killed his career.

98
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:48,928
Holder of the fastest laps at Willard, Union, and Butler.

99
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:52,736
I hope he's as fast off the track as he is on.

100
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,286
Never a dull day

101
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:20,490
Let's get the fuck out of here.

102
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:28,683
Heads up, its Pachenko

103
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,146
So you're the wife killer?

104
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,194
It takes a big man, to kill a woman..

105
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,387
Suppose you rape kiddies too

106
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,359
You hear that everyone?

107
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:59,167
The guy kills women...rapes kiddies.

108
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,985
What do you think we gonna do about that?

109
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:17,044
Get on the ground, now!

110
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:18,890
Nobody move!

111
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:23,833
Nobody move!

112
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:29,399
I guess he didn't like the oatmeal either.

113
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:36,866
Prisoner No. 77119, ma'am.

114
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:40,081
Thank you, Mr. Ulrich

115
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,272
This prison is the home to murderers, rapists..

116
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,330
..And violent offenders of every kind.

117
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:51,665
The United States Penal System sends me the worst of the worst.

118
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:56,943
But the men you've provoked..
Well, let's just say Mr. Ames

119
00:17:57,183 --> 00:18:00,607
that the life term you've joined us for may be
a lot shorter than you think.

120
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:06,954
I understand tradition. Soften up the new guy
And a slipping good time had by all.

121
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:17,070
Foul language is an issue.. for me.

122
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,255
While looking over your record,
I couldn't help noticing your occupational history.

123
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:36,313
It seems you have some talent behind the wheel.

124
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,737
Out of curiosity, when was the last time you raced?

125
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:48,035
It's been a while.
I lost my license.

126
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,564
What if I could help you?

127
00:18:51,737 --> 00:18:53,257
Get my license back?

128
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:56,632
I had something else in mind.

129
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:04,268
You're familiar with the Death Race,
and the driver the fans call Frankenstein?

130
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:09,047
A man so disfigured by crashes,
that he's forced to wear a mask.

131
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:12,701
His return to the track is highly anticipated..

132
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,029
And therein lies my problem.

133
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:19,327
No one knows yet, but poor Frank died on an operating table

134
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:21,337
Not long after his last race.

135
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:26,597
Anyone can wear the mask,
But not just anyone can drive the car.

136
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:31,857
You have the skills required to keep the legend alive.

137
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:36,877
I want you to become Frankenstein.

138
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:39,887
No thanks.

139
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:42,580
He's dead.

140
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:44,994
Why don't you just tell the truth?

141
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,244
The audience wants to see Frank again.

142
00:19:50,408 --> 00:19:53,466
He moves them. Inspires them.

143
00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:56,312
And in this world that's not so easy to come by.

144
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:05,871
What makes you think for a second,
I would risk my life doing this for you?

145
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:11,054
Win five races, you go free.

146
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,910
Those are the rules

147
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:16,718
And Frank has won four.

148
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:22,825
Win one more, you walk.

149
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:25,238
Call it intuition, but

150
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:31,864
I don't think you belong in here with the rest of these animals.

151
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:37,163
I might surprise you.

152
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,742
The race is Friday, and I need your decision.

153
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:57,329
You're a skilled driver.
Your chances are good

154
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,698
I'm offering you your freedom, Mr. Ames.

155
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,401
If it's not worth risking your life for,
what is?

156
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:24,268
Now turn her up, and tie the lines.

157
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:32,183
Ma'am
You don't have to call me Ma'am, you know that.

158
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:34,510
This is Mr Ames

159
00:21:35,154 --> 00:21:36,318
You know why he's here.

160
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:37,972
I do now..

161
00:21:39,376 --> 00:21:41,424
Race is less than a week away

162
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:43,347
I have great confidence in you.

163
00:21:45,078 --> 00:21:47,011
Well then, I'll leave you two to get acquaintant.

164
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:54,993
Jensen Garner Ames.
Moved to the states at twenty-four years old.

165
00:21:55,118 --> 00:21:57,608
Named after a car, the Jensen Intercepter.

166
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:02,955
A three time local speedway champion.
You've done your homework, or do you just know everything?

167
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:08,850
Jensen Intercepter. I had one.
Handled like a school bus.

168
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:12,427
Call me Coach, everyone does.

169
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:15,043
Gunner.. Lists.

170
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:18,659
This's Frank.

171
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:20,265
I'll show you around

172
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:25,246
We have a fully functioning autoshop.
Just like you'd find in the outside world.

173
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:30,862
Each team has their own shop.
We don't help them, They don't help us.

174
00:22:30,987 --> 00:22:33,593
With the inmates you're Jensen Ames, new greasemonkey.

175
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:36,988
Nobody will know you're Frank, except us on the team, and a handful of the guards.

176
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:38,065
Nobody will talk.

177
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:40,546
How can you be so sure?
-Hennessey..

178
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,643
In here, she's Judge, Jury and Executioner

179
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:47,528
The race is her baby.
Anyone who threatens it, she kills.

180
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,951
The audience for the race is half,
since Frank has been out of the game

181
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:55,884
And so is the corporations profit
Thats why she needs you.

182
00:22:56,852 --> 00:22:57,737
What's back there?

183
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:00,429
Thats a good question.

184
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:04,401
Hennessey has had a whole wing of the prison in isolation for a month.

185
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:06,488
Working on something.

186
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:08,940
Time to meet the monster.

187
00:23:14,642 --> 00:23:19,547
Mustang V8 Fastback
Took the best, and made it better.

188
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:24,249
That's a V8 Rouch 5.4 liter, with a Ford Racing supercharger.

189
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:26,894
Putting out 850 horsepower, and close to..

190
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,144
750lbs. of torque with sequential module port fuel injection.

191
00:23:31,471 --> 00:23:34,289
Looks like there's a 250HP NOS unit.

192
00:23:35,452 --> 00:23:36,452
Just in case.

193
00:23:39,462 --> 00:23:43,078
Then we had some fun,
Customizing a personal protection package.

194
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,059
3 quarter inch steel plate, front, sides.

195
00:23:47,463 --> 00:23:50,954
Bulletproof glasses will here.. here.. and there.

196
00:23:51,839 --> 00:24:00,792
And in the rear.. the 6 inch solid steel shield we call
'The Tombstone'

197
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:06,975
Oil.. Smoke
And napalm for defence.

198
00:24:06,975 --> 00:24:11,120
Twin 30mm belt fed machine guns for offense.

199
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:12,437
So where's the ammo?

200
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:14,534
We get that on race day.

201
00:24:15,293 --> 00:24:19,188
Pity.
Yeah, everyone thinks that...the first time.

202
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:20,188
Thinks what?

203
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:23,208
About turning the guns on the guards. About escaping.

204
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:25,218
No, I wasn't thinking that.

205
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:30,439
Well I'm glad, because Hennessey's got electric kill switches on all the guns on all the cars.

206
00:24:30,757 --> 00:24:35,661
And all the guard towers are fortified,
and their guns are bigger than your guns.

207
00:24:35,661 --> 00:24:40,517
Oh, did I mention the helicopters and also the fact that
we're on an island here a mile from the nearest shoreline?

208
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,691
The only way in or out of here is on that one skinny bridge you came in on.

209
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:01,816
What's that?
The most important part of the car.

210
00:25:21,132 --> 00:25:24,459
The race takes place in 3 stages over 3 days.

211
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:27,998
The first two stages you just gotta try
and get rid of as much of the competition as you can.

212
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:30,325
While getting your own skinny ass over the line alive.

213
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:35,066
Third stage is where speed counts
First one over that line wins.

214
00:25:36,122 --> 00:25:40,218
Tomorrow morning you'll meet your navigator Case.

215
00:25:41,344 --> 00:25:45,440
She'll help you navigate the course, reload your weapons,
and help with the running of the car.

216
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:48,017
I'd like to talk to her ahead of time before the race.

217
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,191
Yeah, I'd like a big-tittied girl to lick peanut butter off my toes.
But it ain't gonna happen.

218
00:25:51,345 --> 00:25:53,960
This is still a prison, man. She's a chick.

219
00:25:54,316 --> 00:25:56,653
They get bussed in from the women's facility upstate.

220
00:25:57,047 --> 00:26:00,019
It's all about ratings. Fast cars, pretty women...

221
00:26:00,067 --> 00:26:04,279
Machine Gun Joe's the only one that has male navigators,
'cause he's gay.

222
00:26:04,317 --> 00:26:08,654
Actually it's because he goes through them so fast,
and audience gets squeamish.

223
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,905
Yeah he goes through them...through their ass.

224
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:16,073
He cuts each kill into his skin as a souvenir, right here.

225
00:26:16,515 --> 00:26:17,804
What about the rest of the drivers?

226
00:26:18,121 --> 00:26:18,967
Lists?

227
00:26:20,487 --> 00:26:21,573
14K

228
00:26:22,016 --> 00:26:25,631
First generation Chinese-american.
10th generation Triad.

229
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:30,488
His father sent him to business school
He's the only man in here who holds a degree from the MIT

230
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,671
He's killed 4 men off the track (That we know of)
Another 7 on it.

231
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,479
Hector Grimm, The Grimm Reaper.

232
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:42,460
The man is a master. clinical psychopath.
Three time consecutive life sentences.

233
00:26:43,306 --> 00:26:46,720
He's killed 6 men off the track,
Another 12 on it.

234
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,817
You've already met the local chapter of
The Brotherhood.

235
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:54,712
Their driver, Pachenko, has killed 9 men on the track.

236
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:56,558
Nobody knows how many off.

237
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,260
Travis Colt, our local superstar.

238
00:27:01,414 --> 00:27:03,828
Used to race for NASCAR.
-Yeah,he was good too.

239
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:08,684
Until he fell asleep behind the wheel of his Mercedez,
with the help of a bottle of scotch and a handful of ludes.

240
00:27:08,732 --> 00:27:12,906
Wiped out the entire patio of Moscala, sent a dozen people to the hospital...

241
00:27:13,602 --> 00:27:14,814
Killed three of them.

242
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:19,555
Technically, best driver in here but
a mean son of a bitch quitter.

243
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:20,516
Ladies..

244
00:27:25,334 --> 00:27:29,392
I hear your man Frank's still in the infirmary with
15 unhealed fractures

245
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:32,441
I also hear he's not gonna make the race.

246
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,008
You hear a lot.

247
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:36,864
Who's the new fish?

248
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:38,547
Greasemonkey.

249
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,519
Well well. Monkey.

250
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:47,346
I got a new name for you.. Igor

251
00:27:48,106 --> 00:27:51,203
Because you about the ugliest motherfucker out here in this prison yo!

252
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:55,895
It's funny, huh?

253
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,137
You tell Frank when you see him
This race is between me and him.

254
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:11,763
This time won't be infirmary, it'll be the morgue.

255
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:14,532
I'll be sure to pass it on.

256
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:19,840
Lets get out of here..

257
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:25,139
Man, that's one angry homo.

258
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:36,025
Who're they?

259
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:38,237
Work detail..

260
00:28:38,554 --> 00:28:41,045
Get to work on the track,
for good behavior.

261
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:43,776
Those are GPS tracking bracelets.

262
00:28:43,853 --> 00:28:46,343
In case someone decides to go for a swim..

263
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:33,224
The ring.

264
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:41,850
This was the old Frank's.

265
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:45,831
It got melted to his hand.

266
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:17,402
Frankenstein! Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

267
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:43,528
Asshole

268
00:30:49,711 --> 00:30:50,711
He's all yours.

269
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:57,260
Don't talk to the other drivers. Frank never did.
Part of the mystique.

270
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,107
Let the mask do the work.

271
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:17,909
Here comes trouble.

272
00:31:44,056 --> 00:31:44,931
Thats your girl.

273
00:32:16,223 --> 00:32:18,829
I'm Case.
Frank.

274
00:32:19,156 --> 00:32:20,560
Well you don't sound like Frank.

275
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:25,224
Don't sweat it, I know.
I drove with Frank.

276
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:29,398
I'll watch your back.
Better then you watched his, I hope.

277
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,795
You're still here.. I guess I got to work
a little harder.

278
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:41,084
Get back to your car, prisoner

279
00:32:45,786 --> 00:32:46,844
You sure know how to make friends.

280
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:53,979
Case, this is mirror glass. No one can see in,
so you might want to take the mask off.

281
00:32:54,018 --> 00:32:55,422
Unless you like it under there..

282
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,240
How the hell does he drive in that thing?

283
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:06,317
What?

284
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,298
You're better looking than the last Frank.

285
00:33:10,058 --> 00:33:11,664
Few crashes should change that..

286
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:17,165
Start the transmission.

287
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:19,655
3, 2, 1

288
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:22,146

Travis Colt!

302
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:13,338
Audience favorite Frankenstein resumes his bitter grudgematch with Machine Gun Joe!

303
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:16,817
Frankenstein returns to the track after his 6 month absence!
-They've missed him.

304
00:34:17,575 --> 00:34:19,701
He's the man, that just won't die!

305
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:25,567
12 millions hit, on his angle alone
And he hasn't even started the engine.

306
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:28,779
We'll do 45 million viewers today.

307
00:34:33,596 --> 00:34:37,491
So what are you in for?
They say I killed a cop.

308
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:40,347
Did you do it?

309
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,107
Yeah.

310
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:43,876
Bad cop?

311
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:45,963
Good cop..

312
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:49,656
Lousy husband.

313
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,358
Frank, Case.. you read me?
We hear you.

314
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:56,926
This is a 3 lap race.

315
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,936
Hennessey doesn't activate the weapons 'til lap 2.

316
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:07,812
Remember it's first come, first serve. So it pays to be out in front.

317
00:35:12,505 --> 00:35:13,274
This is it.

318
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:15,034
Countdown

319
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:30,858
Are you sure he can deliver?

320
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,177
Dive left toward 100 feet.

321
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:55,322
15 ... 20
Now

322
00:37:01,698 --> 00:37:03,515
Punch it, hard left up ahead.

323
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,709
He seems to be handling himself.

324
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:44,635
Wakey!

325
00:37:56,127 --> 00:37:56,685
Fuck!

326
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,773
We're being passed, you gotta catch up!

327
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:14,110
Bro, I know what I'm doing!

328
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:19,695
Man just leave them!
-Shut up man...I know what the hell I'm doin'!

329
00:38:22,157 --> 00:38:23,003
What you gonna do?

330
00:38:36,457 --> 00:38:39,188
You can't go head-to-head with Joe like this, he'll tear you apart.

331
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:46,246
Listen to him, before you get us both killed.

332
00:38:42,669 --> 00:38:43,515
You read me?!

333
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:49,814
There's a shortcut to the left.

334
00:38:47,323 --> 00:38:48,247
Case, help him out of there!

335
00:38:51,093 --> 00:38:51,574
There!

336
00:38:58,632 --> 00:38:59,680
You don't think I see that?!

337
00:38:57,517 --> 00:38:58,392
He's takin' a shortcut!

338
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:19,779
Activate Swords and Shields.

339
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,512
Swords are the main guns.

340
00:39:26,637 --> 00:39:28,436
Shields trigger the napalm, oil and smoke.

341
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:49,573
Activate Death Heads.

342
00:39:51,861 --> 00:39:52,467
Death Heads activated.

343
00:39:58,881 --> 00:39:59,728
Get it baby!

344
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:24,067
Score that one for the Reaper, baby!

345
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:29,935
Thank you!
-Don't mention it. -Come on it's all clear.

346
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:40,590
Fuck you puto! Fuck you!

347
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,162
Got guns!

348
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:00,327
Oil!

349
00:41:11,924 --> 00:41:12,357
Damn!

350
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:14,867
"Tu hermanos puto!" mother fucker!

351
00:41:14,867 --> 00:41:15,713
Oh yeah!

352
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:17,577
What the fuck?!

353
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,933
We gotta get back in the race!

354
00:42:12,862 --> 00:42:15,276
Fucking Reaper baby, can't kill me.

355
00:42:16,526 --> 00:42:17,526
You can burn me.

356
00:42:17,718 --> 00:42:20,844
You can fuckin' shoot me, but you just can't fuckin' kill me!

357
00:42:31,297 --> 00:42:33,143
Get that off my window when we get back.

358
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,538
Streaming to 46 million viewers ma'am.

359
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:43,897
I'm back!

360
00:43:02,341 --> 00:43:04,178
Thanks
- My pleasure.

361
00:43:04,955 --> 00:43:05,791
Shield, up ahead!

362
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,042
Son of a bitch!

363
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:11,359
Just stole a Shield from Colt!

364
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:13,898
Defense weapons are on!

365
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:19,428
Let him have it.

366
00:43:20,274 --> 00:43:21,514
Napalm won't fire!

367
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:23,005
Smoke!

368
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:28,089
No smoke, no oil...no napalm!

369
00:43:29,381 --> 00:43:30,162
Again?!

370
00:43:37,122 --> 00:43:37,997
Fuck man!

371
00:43:43,132 --> 00:43:44,777
Remember me motherfucker?!

372
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,064
Coach!

373
00:43:55,189 --> 00:43:56,920
The Tombstone won't take much more of this!

374
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:03,017
Frank, Case...those 50 caliber shells will be through the Tombstone in a matter of seconds.

375
00:44:03,383 --> 00:44:05,873
My advice...either lose him or kill him.

376
00:44:12,672 --> 00:44:13,941
Unhook the napalm.

377
00:44:19,817 --> 00:44:20,461
Get on my lap!

378
00:44:20,894 --> 00:44:21,183
What?

379
00:44:21,904 --> 00:44:22,702
Get on my lap!

380
00:44:41,406 --> 00:44:42,329
What the hell?

381
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,888
Merry Christmas asshole!

382
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:49,340
Aw shit!

383
00:45:10,429 --> 00:45:11,236
Nice work.

384
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:34,576
Where's he goin'?

385
00:45:35,018 --> 00:45:36,624
Shortcut! Punch it, we can beat him!

386
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:47,971
Look out!

387
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:06,618
Grim, Colt, and Siad are gone.

388
00:46:06,733 --> 00:46:08,906
Six remaining drivers alive.

389
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,118
Subscribe to stage 2 now.

390
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,697
We have 14 hours gentlemen, so let's get to work.

391
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:27,928
Starting with this...

392
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:33,621
So what happened out there Case?
-Got distracted.

393
00:46:33,736 --> 00:46:35,284
He got distracted?

394
00:46:45,028 --> 00:46:45,797
Coach!

395
00:46:46,509 --> 00:46:47,999
What?!
-Look at this!

396
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:49,644
Oil sprays were fine.

397
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,173
Well I'll be damned.

398
00:47:01,934 --> 00:47:02,616
Stop

399
00:47:23,898 --> 00:47:25,706
What can I do for you Mr. Ames?

400
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,523
You're all lucky a driver like me just happened to turn up in your prison when I did.

401
00:47:30,879 --> 00:47:32,206
I'm more than lucky.

402
00:47:33,533 --> 00:47:34,322
I'm blessed.

403
00:47:35,164 --> 00:47:38,790
Sometimes it's like the right hand of God is sitting on my shoulder.

404
00:47:42,463 --> 00:47:43,829
I'm not racing tomorrow.

405
00:47:45,983 --> 00:47:46,839
Go fuck yourself.

406
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,358
Wait.

407
00:47:50,724 --> 00:47:52,205
Take his shackles off.

408
00:48:06,254 --> 00:48:07,658
Excuse us Mr. Ulrich.

409
00:48:11,399 --> 00:48:12,842
And take Mr. James with you

410
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,747
Do you recognize these people?

411
00:48:28,284 --> 00:48:31,659
Because your daughter will.  They're her new parents.

412
00:48:32,986 --> 00:48:33,900
What's her name?

413
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,035
Piper.

414
00:48:37,718 --> 00:48:40,410
That's the man she'll grow up calling daddy.

415
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:44,507
Unless you do something about it.

416
00:48:46,497 --> 00:48:47,180
Where's she now?

417
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,392
Oh I'm sure I have her address around here somewhere.

418
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:54,219
You're a smart man Mr. Ames.

419
00:48:55,864 --> 00:48:58,355
Play my game, we both go home happy.

420
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:02,009
The man who killed my wife is in this prison.

421
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,471
I wonder what he'll say when I ask him why he did it.

422
00:49:07,232 --> 00:49:11,050
Why don't you look in a mirror, and ask him.

423
00:49:12,618 --> 00:49:18,945
Poor Piper...Must be hard growing up without knowing.
That your father killed your mother.

424
00:49:39,755 --> 00:49:41,121
You wanted a monster?

425
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,179
You've got one.

426
00:50:03,345 --> 00:50:04,431
She has your eye.

427
00:50:08,287 --> 00:50:09,797
They're her mother's.

428
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,365
So why do you wear a number, Coach?

429
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:15,779
Because I'm not a prisoner.

430
00:50:16,538 --> 00:50:20,433
I qualified for parole 3 years ago.

431
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:27,578
I got as far as the gate.
They got a name for it...something or other -Syndrome.

432
00:50:29,588 --> 00:50:33,646
Simple fact is...the world's changed since I've been in here.

433
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:35,858
Don't know it, don't much want to.

434
00:50:36,214 --> 00:50:39,349
But this? This I know.

435
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:40,733
What'd they send you away for?

436
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:43,849
Oh plenty...or nothing.

437
00:50:44,705 --> 00:50:46,638
To what do we owe the pleasure of your company?

438
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:49,773
I killed my wife.

439
00:50:50,456 --> 00:50:51,533
Bullshit.

440
00:50:53,581 --> 00:50:55,956
You're a hard man but you ain't no wife killer.

441
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,158
How do you know?

442
00:50:57,803 --> 00:50:59,370
I've met my share.

443
00:51:00,209 --> 00:51:02,623
And you, the way you look at her.

444
00:51:03,324 --> 00:51:05,729
Couldn't do that if you killed her mother.

445
00:51:06,073 --> 00:51:06,871
So...

446
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:11,093
I say bullshit.

447
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:14,805
Coach

448
00:51:19,257 --> 00:51:21,940
What would you say if I told you Hennessey had my wife killed?

449
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:25,633
And me framed for it so she could bring me in here to be her Frankenstein.

450
00:51:27,037 --> 00:51:28,883
What would you say to that bullshit?

451
00:51:34,903 --> 00:51:36,432
Her name was Suzy.

452
00:51:39,884 --> 00:51:41,894
Was always headed here, always knew.

453
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:46,029
She didn't.

454
00:51:50,203 --> 00:51:52,088
She was my chance at something else.

455
00:51:57,386 --> 00:52:00,041
That bitch took her away from me.

456
00:52:13,321 --> 00:52:20,918
The days may be long on the land which the Lord, I giveth thee.

457
00:52:49,787 --> 00:52:50,219
Kill...

458
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:46,498
Thou shalt not...

459
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:09,145
You should take a break, get some sleep.

460
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:11,329
I'm okay Lists.

461
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:19,163
Concentration for the race...
Concentration that's what you need.  You gotta get your rest.

462
00:53:26,462 --> 00:53:27,260
Maybe you're right.

463
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:30,434
I'll take that break after all.

464
00:53:37,011 --> 00:53:37,694
Good call.

465
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,819
Got can't grind for shit.

466
00:54:12,304 --> 00:54:13,188
Lookin' for me?

467
00:54:16,881 --> 00:54:17,718
Him him!

468
00:54:28,113 --> 00:54:28,988
You killed my wife!

469
00:54:34,893 --> 00:54:36,143
Well then...maybe I did.

470
00:54:38,662 --> 00:54:41,903
I don't care if the queen bitch wants to save you for the track.

471
00:54:42,788 --> 00:54:45,432
Nobody disrespects the Brotherhood and lives.

472
00:54:47,442 --> 00:54:48,327
Put him down.

473
00:54:50,593 --> 00:54:51,833
I'm gonna take your head.

474
00:55:11,403 --> 00:55:12,249
Who is this fuck?!

475
00:56:09,313 --> 00:56:10,400
Just let me go.

476
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:12,929
Let me go man.

477
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:18,554
I'll do anything.

478
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:21,718
You're gonna die here.

479
00:56:23,074 --> 00:56:23,843
Fuck you!

480
00:56:27,527 --> 00:56:30,863
Now now boys.  Let's save that for the track...huh?

481
00:56:55,366 --> 00:56:56,126
Coach!

482
00:56:56,934 --> 00:56:57,895
Take a look at this!

483
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:08,483
What the hell are they building here?

484
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:14,493
You'll find out soon enough.

485
00:57:27,658 --> 00:57:28,533
Prisoner

486
00:57:32,428 --> 00:57:33,351
Time to get ready.

487
00:57:40,371 --> 00:57:43,295
Welcome to the next installment of Death Race.

488
00:57:43,622 --> 00:57:45,305
Stage 2 begins...

489
00:57:46,103 --> 00:57:48,228
Grim, Cold and Siad are gone.

490
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,036
6 remaining drivers alive.

491
00:57:50,517 --> 00:57:53,767
14K, Pachenko...

492
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:55,565
Riggins...

493
00:57:56,575 --> 00:57:57,614
Carson...

494
00:57:58,133 --> 00:58:00,258
3 time winner, Machine Gun Joe.

495
00:58:01,181 --> 00:58:05,393
And starting from the back of the grid, his archrival Frankenstein.

496
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,480
This could be the last time we see Frankenstein race.

497
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:11,250
Just one more victory and he wins his freedom.

498
00:58:11,615 --> 00:58:13,577
If Joe doesn't kill him first.

499
00:58:15,548 --> 00:58:17,991
Over 50 million viewers have already subscribed.

500
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:20,395
Don't miss this epic battle.

501
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,443
Subscribe to stage 2 now.

502
00:58:43,155 --> 00:58:44,002
Pay attention.

503
00:58:56,118 --> 00:58:56,917
Where is he?

504
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:02,052
What are you doing?

505
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:06,418
What's he doing?

506
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:13,245
He's dropping back.

507
00:59:16,371 --> 00:59:17,448
We're gonna have a little talk.

508
00:59:17,448 --> 00:59:19,862
We're gonna be done by the time we leave the tunnel.

509
00:59:24,593 --> 00:59:25,035
What?

510
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,266
Did you kill the old Frank?

511
00:59:25,554 --> 00:59:26,757
Tunnel comes in fast.

512
00:59:27,959 --> 00:59:30,122
Remember what happened to that napalm canister?

513
00:59:33,334 --> 00:59:35,382
It'd be a real shame for that to happen to you.

514
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:41,479
Did you kill the old Frank?

515
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:46,047
I sabotaged his rear weapons.

516
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:47,413
Why?

517
00:59:48,817 --> 00:59:49,740
Hennessy...

518
00:59:50,105 --> 00:59:53,269
She said she signed my release papers.  It's my life back.

519
00:59:55,837 --> 00:59:56,760
I didn't kill him.

520
00:59:54,308 --> 00:59:55,471
And you killed him too...

521
00:59:57,116 --> 00:59:59,606
He wouldn't quit. I just wanted to make sure he didn't win.

522
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:01,414
Why would Hennessy want that?

523
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:04,376
To keep Frank here...racing.

524
01:00:06,742 --> 01:00:07,473
Yesterday?

525
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,396
She wanted me to set you back.

526
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:12,358
So...I'm not supposed to win either?

527
01:00:12,406 --> 01:00:14,368
Just to make it exciting.

528
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:21,907
That's all I wanted to know.

529
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,398
Hold tight.

530
01:00:43,323 --> 01:00:45,371
Come on! Lap 2!

531
01:01:06,191 --> 01:01:06,989
Damn!

532
01:01:14,326 --> 01:01:15,490
He's going after Pachenko.

533
01:01:50,608 --> 01:01:52,694
Shield ahead, take defense.

534
01:01:53,496 --> 01:01:54,218
No

535
01:01:57,026 --> 01:01:58,266
There's someone I need to kill.

536
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:03,882
You're out in front, who you gonna shoot at?

537
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:06,777
You're a dead man!

538
01:02:12,825 --> 01:02:14,037
I told you to take defense!

539
01:02:29,472 --> 01:02:30,876
He's too heavily armored!

540
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:36,857
Fuck!

541
01:02:39,578 --> 01:02:40,463
Hit the smoke.

542
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,440
This is a race, you don't go backwards.

543
01:03:40,551 --> 01:03:42,195
You don't get out of the car.

544
01:03:54,745 --> 01:03:55,908
It was Hennessy...

545
01:03:56,274 --> 01:03:59,438
Hennessy!
-I know...she's next.

546
01:04:14,478 --> 01:04:15,199
Frank's out of his car.

547
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:16,363
What?

548
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:19,017
He stepped out of his car!
-Okay, I see it.

549
01:04:19,498 --> 01:04:21,979
I need guns.
-Yeah, Sword coming up in 50 yards.

550
01:04:26,152 --> 01:04:28,643
What happened?
-I don't know, somebody must've grabbed them.

551
01:04:29,162 --> 01:04:30,681
What you mean somebody grabbed them?

552
01:04:30,883 --> 01:04:34,538
Look man...I thought it was lit.
-What you mean you thought?

553
01:04:35,297 --> 01:04:36,624
Man get the fuck outta my car!

554
01:04:37,144 --> 01:04:37,865
What?

555
01:04:38,221 --> 01:04:40,510
I said get the fuck outta my car!

556
01:04:57,156 --> 01:04:59,358
Hell no!

557
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:00,810
Wait man, wait!

558
01:05:07,301 --> 01:05:08,503
Don't let me down boy...

559
01:05:22,822 --> 01:05:23,870
Release the Dreadnaught.

560
01:05:34,535 --> 01:05:35,381
Coach!

561
01:05:45,728 --> 01:05:47,815
Well I guess we know what she was buildin' now...

562
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:57,239
Activate weapons.

563
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,762
Christ!

564
01:06:46,593 --> 01:06:49,199
Coach, any ideas?
-Just have to tough it out I guess.

565
01:06:49,526 --> 01:06:52,728
Hennessy will take it off once she's pumped up the ratings.

566
01:06:55,979 --> 01:06:57,065
You sure about that?

567
01:07:16,558 --> 01:07:18,001
The hell is that thing going?

568
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:21,777
Fuck me..

569
01:08:36,048 --> 01:08:36,817
Lists.

570
01:08:38,298 --> 01:08:39,144
Receiving?

571
01:08:39,385 --> 01:08:40,904
Need to patch me through to another car.

572
01:08:41,433 --> 01:08:42,154
On it...

573
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:48,963
Joe!

574
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:51,213
Who is this?

575
01:08:51,655 --> 01:08:53,136
-Frank
-What do you want?

576
01:08:53,417 --> 01:08:54,985
How about we play a little offense?

577
01:08:58,552 --> 01:08:59,918
I hope you know what you're doing.

578
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,069
Now that's entertainment.

579
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,598
Damn it!

580
01:10:30,263 --> 01:10:38,562
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

581
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:53,523
Nice reflexes there, Igor.

582
01:10:56,812 --> 01:10:58,418
Race car reflexes.

583
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,670
You look lost pal.

584
01:11:02,632 --> 01:11:03,670
Not this time.

585
01:11:05,757 --> 01:11:08,325
Got this feeling that you and Frank are close.

586
01:11:10,296 --> 01:11:11,335
Real close

587
01:11:11,941 --> 01:11:15,585
That weird accent, you even kind of sound like him.

588
01:11:16,066 --> 01:11:19,720
I was wondering...what if you...got in an accident.

589
01:11:21,365 --> 01:11:23,163
Would that throw Frank off his game a little bit?

590
01:11:24,894 --> 01:11:29,789
I doubt it. The sick fucked up guy that he is.

591
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:31,456
He just want to kill you?. 

592
01:11:35,443 --> 01:11:36,040
He's cool.

593
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:42,300
So I guess I'll...see him later, right?

594
01:11:46,029 --> 01:11:47,471
Let's roll.

595
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:07,964
Ma'am with all respect...

596
01:12:08,466 --> 01:12:11,678
What're we going to do?
-We're going to kill him of course.

597
01:12:12,284 --> 01:12:13,890
You want me to kill Frankenstein?

598
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:16,890
Don't be stupid.  Frankenstein can't die.

599
01:12:17,977 --> 01:12:19,977
After all, he's just a mask.

600
01:12:47,138 --> 01:12:49,946
Tonight is the final leg of the Death Race.

601
01:12:50,465 --> 01:12:53,956
And perhaps a new champion will arise.

602
01:12:54,514 --> 01:12:56,197
A five times winner.

603
01:12:56,699 --> 01:13:00,709
The first man ever to gain his freedom.

604
01:13:02,393 --> 01:13:06,009
The world gave you to me because you are not fit to be a part of it.

605
01:13:06,971 --> 01:13:12,221
You are not fit to be husbands.  You are not fit to be fathers.

606
01:13:13,287 --> 01:13:16,980
And were to dangerous to live with the rest of us.

607
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:19,586
What is this shit, man?

608
01:13:20,701 --> 01:13:22,586
But when you race tonight.

609
01:13:23,067 --> 01:13:26,202
Know that the eyes of the world are upon you.

610
01:13:51,907 --> 01:13:58,648
And know that the very same world that rejected you, now lives and breathes with you.

611
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:02,821
And it draws inspiration from your courage.

612
01:14:03,658 --> 01:14:05,668
No one's ever gonna win 5 races.

613
01:14:05,745 --> 01:14:07,428
So...race well.

614
01:14:07,972 --> 01:14:09,857
Nobody's ever getting out of here.

615
01:14:10,059 --> 01:14:13,550
And know that I consider you all, my heroes.

616
01:14:24,935 --> 01:14:26,580
I wanna show you something.

617
01:14:30,255 --> 01:14:31,001
Can't kill me...

618
01:14:31,413 --> 01:14:32,779
I'm the fucking Reaper.

619
01:14:36,387 --> 01:14:39,358
You can burn me, you can shoot me.

620
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,522
But you can't fucking-

621
01:14:41,522 --> 01:14:42,515
There...

622
01:14:57,876 --> 01:14:59,053
Gunner, Lists...

623
01:14:59,774 --> 01:15:02,861
Will Hennessy's inspectors care if we add a half gallon of reserve tank?

624
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:06,477
Another half gallon?
You got a fuel tank that holds 35 gallons.

625
01:15:07,452 --> 01:15:08,817
What the hell do you want another half gallon for?

626
01:15:10,308 --> 01:15:11,308
Coach.

627
01:15:11,904 --> 01:15:13,395
Let's give the man what he wants.

628
01:15:17,203 --> 01:15:18,126
Where are you going?

629
01:15:25,983 --> 01:15:27,348
This is not good

630
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:43,591
Real brave coming over here.

631
01:15:49,928 --> 01:15:53,217
I'm gonna win this race, because I want out of this shit hole.

632
01:15:54,746 --> 01:16:00,679
I've already won 3 races. Two more, and I'm smoking cohebas in Miami.

633
01:16:04,208 --> 01:16:06,257
Frank might wanna think about that.

634
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:10,382
Because I'm gone...outta here.

635
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:13,873
Then maybe it's his turn.

636
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,479
Maybe he's thinking it's the other way around.

637
01:16:21,739 --> 01:16:24,990
From here on out, stay the fuck out of my pit.

638
01:16:33,948 --> 01:16:34,669
Hey!

639
01:16:37,516 --> 01:16:39,487
Think you and Frank should have a little talk.

640
01:16:44,574 --> 01:16:48,748
Welcome to the final installment of Death Race.

641
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:50,594
Seven men dead.

642
01:16:50,835 --> 01:16:51,758
Siad

643
01:16:52,046 --> 01:16:52,806
Grim

644
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:54,210
Colt

645
01:16:54,451 --> 01:16:55,258
Pachenko

646
01:16:55,374 --> 01:16:56,739
Carson

647
01:16:57,028 --> 01:17:01,201
Riggins, and 14K are all dead.

648
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:04,731
Just Frankenstein and Machine Gun Joe survived.

649
01:17:04,933 --> 01:17:07,096
Frank racing for his freedom.

650
01:17:07,298 --> 01:17:09,837
And Joe doing anything to stop him.

651
01:17:10,087 --> 01:17:13,174
It's "mano e mano" and there will be no mercy.

652
01:17:13,414 --> 01:17:16,905
Tonight, only one man will walk off this track alive.

653
01:17:17,068 --> 01:17:19,636
A record 70 million are already watching.

654
01:17:19,538 --> 01:17:23,067
Join them! Subscribe to the final stage now!

655
01:17:26,837 --> 01:17:28,279
It's an honor to navigate for you Sir.

656
01:17:28,758 --> 01:17:30,395
They call me Nathan
-Save it...

657
01:17:30,405 --> 01:17:32,010
We won't have time to get acquainted.

658
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:36,540
The hell are those?

659
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,446
Model 7 Russian State's Armory RPGs.

660
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:44,504
Armor piercing, self arming...accurate to a thousand yards.

661
01:17:46,351 --> 01:17:47,226
That's what I thought.

662
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:55,094
Prisoner, step back.

663
01:18:05,557 --> 01:18:07,768
I thought maybe you could use a little inspiration.

664
01:18:10,173 --> 01:18:13,625
Your release papers.

665
01:18:14,789 --> 01:18:17,789
All you have to do is walk off that track alive.

666
01:18:17,914 --> 01:18:20,520
Well...and win of course.

667
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:33,271
But if you do win, I want you to think about staying here.

668
01:18:34,397 --> 01:18:37,964
As Frankenstein.

669
01:18:39,051 --> 01:18:40,416
Pfft...yeah.

670
01:18:41,618 --> 01:18:43,099
I can see the appeal.

671
01:18:44,782 --> 01:18:47,311
What would you do with your freedom?

672
01:18:48,312 --> 01:18:49,600
Go back to your daughter?

673
01:18:50,119 --> 01:18:51,322
That's the idea.

674
01:18:51,968 --> 01:18:56,574
The thing is...are you really the best future she could possibly have?

675
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:02,757
Are you really daddy material, or deep down are you something else?

676
01:19:08,373 --> 01:19:11,941
If you decided that out there on that track is where you belong.

677
01:19:12,105 --> 01:19:18,798
It would be the most unselfish act of love, I've ever seen.

678
01:19:23,048 --> 01:19:24,452
Just something to think about.

679
01:20:03,322 --> 01:20:05,928
What's this?
-Small modification.

680
01:20:07,774 --> 01:20:09,659
So Hennessy tells me, if you're going to win.

681
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:11,256
I'm supposed to stop you.

682
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,265
Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

683
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:17,679
Sounds like the odds are staked against us.

684
01:20:18,237 --> 01:20:19,362
Then do what you do best.

685
01:20:22,045 --> 01:20:22,728
Drive.

686
01:20:33,699 --> 01:20:36,834
Gentlemen, this should be interesting.

687
01:21:00,336 --> 01:21:01,413
Lit Sword up ahead.

688
01:21:01,942 --> 01:21:02,904
Deactivate that.

689
01:21:03,298 --> 01:21:04,625
Sir?
-Just do it.

690
01:21:06,673 --> 01:21:07,433
Push it back on.

691
01:21:08,876 --> 01:21:09,683
Weapons are up!

692
01:21:10,684 --> 01:21:11,443
Damn it!

693
01:21:22,031 --> 01:21:22,714
Shit

694
01:21:24,877 --> 01:21:25,839
Lit Shield up ahead.

695
01:21:30,378 --> 01:21:31,099
Damn it!

696
01:21:31,355 --> 01:21:33,288
What happened?
-Hennessy must've deactivated it.

697
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:34,627
Bitch!

698
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:41,804
Light me up!

699
01:21:48,949 --> 01:21:49,873
It's party time.

700
01:22:19,953 --> 01:22:21,472
Coach, we gotta get some fire power.

701
01:22:22,078 --> 01:22:23,598
Nothing lit for a half lap.

702
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:24,925
We won't last that long!

703
01:23:02,188 --> 01:23:04,275
Drop the Tombstone.
-What?

704
01:23:04,708 --> 01:23:05,631
Do it.

705
01:23:10,045 --> 01:23:10,930
On my mark.

706
01:23:11,613 --> 01:23:12,334
Three ...

707
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:15,142
Two ...

708
01:23:16,421 --> 01:23:17,431
One ...

709
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:20,517
Mark!

710
01:23:24,364 --> 01:23:25,085
Damn it!

711
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:29,018
That shit don't work twice playboy!

712
01:23:36,038 --> 01:23:36,721
Shit!

713
01:23:37,219 --> 01:23:38,143
Shield at a quarter lap.

714
01:23:38,864 --> 01:23:41,556
You hear that? Lit Shield at a quarter lap.

715
01:23:55,914 --> 01:23:56,914
He's coming up fast!

716
01:23:58,683 --> 01:23:59,760
Let them get the Shield.

717
01:24:00,164 --> 01:24:01,443
Keep the viewers interested.

718
01:24:11,473 --> 01:24:13,156
Son of a bitch, he got the Shield.

719
01:24:19,493 --> 01:24:22,705
Arm the explosive...Just in case.

720
01:24:29,639 --> 01:24:30,725
Yo Franken'freak!

721
01:24:30,889 --> 01:24:34,216
This Villager's got a pitch fork, and it's headed straight up your ass!

722
01:25:00,325 --> 01:25:01,248
What just happened?

723
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:10,648
Yeah boy!

724
01:25:11,876 --> 01:25:14,204
They're off the track. They're escaping!

725
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:15,771
They're headed for the bridge.

726
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:17,694
Their weapons, hit the killswitches!

727
01:25:21,464 --> 01:25:23,666
Seventy million viewers ma'am, they're all watching!

728
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:25,955
Shut the webcast down!

729
01:25:26,195 --> 01:25:28,840
Shut it down!
-Shut the fucking computers down now!

730
01:25:33,417 --> 01:25:35,100
Get out, get out, get out now!

731
01:25:35,225 --> 01:25:35,946
Get out!

732
01:25:42,562 --> 01:25:46,332
Yo Frankenstein, it's good we had that little talk.

733
01:25:49,659 --> 01:25:51,381
You gave that bitch a good show huh?

734
01:25:57,805 --> 01:25:58,564
Give me that!

735
01:25:59,766 --> 01:26:00,815
Okay cock sucker.

736
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:05,786
Fuck with me, and we'll see who shits on the sidewalk!

737
01:26:09,217 --> 01:26:10,737
Somebody's mad right now...

738
01:26:11,141 --> 01:26:12,708
Nobody fucks with my car.

739
01:26:14,833 --> 01:26:15,757
Son of a bitch!

740
01:26:16,516 --> 01:26:17,593
Get the choppers in the air!

741
01:26:37,855 --> 01:26:40,182
We're not gonna get very far.

742
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:41,144
You're right

743
01:26:49,128 --> 01:26:50,166
Now would be a good time?

744
01:27:10,505 --> 01:27:12,746
Very nice modification.

745
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:18,804
That extra half gallon reserve tank should see you through to the finish.

746
01:27:19,891 --> 01:27:22,661
Bon voyage, Frank

747
01:27:53,299 --> 01:27:54,539
Choppers have a visual, ma'am.

748
01:28:07,254 --> 01:28:08,023
Joe?

749
01:28:24,648 --> 01:28:26,408
Give me a pilot, I need to talk to a pilot right now.

750
01:28:28,341 --> 01:28:29,255
You're on.

751
01:28:29,457 --> 01:28:30,861
Stay with Frankenstein, don't lose him!

752
01:28:39,006 --> 01:28:42,573
Sure you're up for this?
-I'm sure, I owe it to Frank.

753
01:28:43,141 --> 01:28:46,824
Besides, Hennessy already gave me my release papers. They have to left me out.

754
01:29:55,753 --> 01:29:56,878
They stopped him, ma'am.

755
01:30:29,945 --> 01:30:33,802
Keep your hands where we can see them.
You are under arrest

756
01:30:34,234 --> 01:30:39,773
I repeat: keep your hands where we can see them.
You are under arrest

757
01:30:44,832 --> 01:30:47,640
Hey Igor, Merry Christmas.

758
01:30:56,977 --> 01:30:58,304
Let's get out of here.

759
01:31:22,124 --> 01:31:22,894
Nice.

760
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:27,663
The fact that you have clothes like these, makes a man question you're-

761
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:28,587
My taste.

762
01:31:28,789 --> 01:31:29,750
Yeah, so to speak.

763
01:31:30,031 --> 01:31:31,839
I don't know about you but I'm headed to Miami.

764
01:31:32,041 --> 01:31:32,877
Yeah, Miami's good.

765
01:31:34,724 --> 01:31:35,685
I'll meet you down there.

766
01:31:37,631 --> 01:31:38,793
Once I got my baby girl.

767
01:31:46,337 --> 01:31:49,166
It's a shame I didn't get to take care of that bitch, Hennessy.

768
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:51,810
Yeah, it is a shame.

769
01:32:02,842 --> 01:32:07,689
Frankenstein has been retrieved.
And ma'am...ratings are off the charts.

770
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:10,863
Gifts and congratulations are already coming in.

771
01:32:12,786 --> 01:32:14,074
You win again.

772
01:32:15,190 --> 01:32:16,354
Mr. Ulrich...

773
01:32:18,681 --> 01:32:19,806
I always win.

774
01:32:22,816 --> 01:32:23,576
Damn...

775
01:32:31,682 --> 01:32:33,086
I love this game

776
01:33:05,167 --> 01:33:06,696
So we had to fix this car?

777
01:33:07,379 --> 01:33:10,946
Don't know how many times we're gonna keep doing this.

778
01:33:11,946 --> 01:33:13,475
Damn it!

779
01:33:14,437 --> 01:33:17,082
You say you want me to live a life of an honest man, huh?

780
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,928
Yeah, you better get used to it.

781
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:25,948
Igor!

782
01:34:09,012 --> 01:34:09,935
What took you so long?

783
01:34:10,137 --> 01:34:11,820
Had trouble getting my release papers approved.

784
01:34:12,263 --> 01:34:13,792
Wait here, there's someone I want you to meet.

785
01:34:19,042 --> 01:34:23,293
Look at her...she has beautiful eyes.

786
01:34:23,495 --> 01:34:24,341
They're her mothers.

787
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:25,822
Where'd you get the rims?

788
01:34:26,707 --> 01:34:29,351
I won it...card game.
-Yeah right...

789
01:34:29,553 --> 01:34:30,313
No really!

790
01:34:31,411 --> 01:34:32,829
How many horse power is in this engine?

791
01:34:33,098 --> 01:34:33,765
500...

792
01:34:34,563 --> 01:34:39,054
Someone once asked me, did I think I was the best future for my little girl.

793
01:34:40,785 --> 01:34:43,949
No one in this world is perfect. Heaven knows, I'm not.

794
01:34:45,238 --> 01:34:47,719
But I love her more than anyone else possibly could.

795
01:34:49,161 --> 01:34:49,930
In the end...

796
01:34:50,892 --> 01:34:53,335
That's all that matters.
