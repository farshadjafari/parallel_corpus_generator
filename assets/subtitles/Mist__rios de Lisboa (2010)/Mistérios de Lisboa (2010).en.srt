00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,504
PAULO BRANCO PRESENTS

2
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:11,580
Based on the homonymous novel by

3
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,614
"This story is not my child,
nor my godchild."

4
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:58,961
"It is not a work of fiction:
It is a diary of suffering..."

5
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:10,097
There have been rumors of
rioting in Campo Grande...

6
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,007
Stories of deaths and fires!

7
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:18,640
Riots to protest the arrival
of British troops supporting Don Pedro.

8
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:24,018
It's not true! I, myself,
went to see, and all was calm,

9
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,693
with no signs of bloodshed,
nor troops.

10
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:35,453
Trustworthy accounts confirm the chaos
of Don Pedro's troops landing in Minho.

11
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:40,660
Even more reliable witnesses guarantee
that nothing really happened,

12
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:45,292
and that the naval fleet was
forced to return to the Azores.

13
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,179
I was fourteen, and I didn't know
who I was at all...

14
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,185
Children! Everyone inside! Lunch!

15
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:05,788
Sometimes the others would ask me
if I was Father Dinis's son.

16
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,164
I didn't know how to answer them.

17
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,715
They all had surnames.
Four or Eve, and some even more.

18
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,967
I was just Joao.

19
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,481
Unlike the others, I had no holidays,
went on no outings, received no presents-

20
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,346
Do you think you're going to find
your father in some book, Joao?

21
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:08,307
Because books don't talk
about shoemakers, or thieves...

22
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,528
Or bastards.
And you are a bastard!

23
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:17,114
The son of a thief or a shoemaker!
If not, then why do they call you Joao?

24
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,906
Just Joao!

25
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,420
You're right. And you can keep
the book, as a gift from me.

26
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,004
You need it more than I do.
Maybe you'll end up learning to read.

27
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,737
I don't know how long passed
between the time I lost consciousness...

28
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,788
and the moment I opened my eyes again.
I thought I had dreamt it all.

29
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,001
It seemed there was someone
in all my fevered visions.

30
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,337
And I wondered for a long time if that
someone was real...

31
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,710
Good morning.

32
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,512
Are you feeling better?

33
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,266
Yes, you're feeling better.

34
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,180
What are you thinking about?

35
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,183
About the boy who
offended my father.

36
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,358
Are you talking about Antonio Santos?

37
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,316
I know his father well.
He's in prison.

38
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,864
A horse thief.

39
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,364
Think about it.

40
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,451
Antonio is a very unhappy boy.

41
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,462
I can't forgive him.

42
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,297
You can't?

43
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,333
Are you sure?

44
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,587
You said I should never lie.

45
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,682
I hate the boy who offended my father.

46
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,467
It's true.

47
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,348
Don't forget what I'm about to tell you:

48
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,481
We must be sincere with God,
and among men, we must be loyal.

49
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:08,035
Joao struck Antonio,
and he answered in return...

50
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,250
I'll keep this with me.

51
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,336
Now eat.

52
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,424
What's that?

53
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,848
A present a lady friend
brought you tonight.

54
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,677
What lady friend?

55
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:30,143
A friend of Father Dinis.

56
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,351
Do you recognize?

57
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,023
Is it a horse?

58
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,921
My son...

59
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,023
It is quite late, Countess.
We must go.

60
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,197
Make haste and have courage,
my child.

61
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,031
And rest easy, he is in good hands.

62
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,264
She is my mother, isn't she?

63
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,142
A lady friend.

64
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,685
But you told me...

65
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,735
You shouldn't speak, Joao!
You mustn't speak...

66
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,490
But she...

67
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,698
Remember what the doctor said.

68
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:58,371
Go on, get some rest.
We'll talk later.

69
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,411
Neither Dona Antonia nor father Dinis
helped to dispel my doubts

70
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,665
regarding that extraordinary visit.

71
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,510
Instead they were evasive and reticent.

72
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:35,789
Who was the first to study
and observe dynamic physics?

73
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,289
Joao.

74
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,791
Galileo.

75
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,000
What is dynamic physics?

76
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,582
Dynamics is the branch of mechanics

77
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,711
that studies forces and the movements
they themselves produce.

78
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,836
And what is force?

79
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,887
That which can alter the resting state
or movement of a body, or distort it.

80
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,686
Dictation!

81
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,971
Father Dinis didn't want me
to just meditate.

82
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,098
As soon as I recovered,
he increased my lessons.

83
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,643
He forced me to reason, scientifically,

84
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,319
in order to distract me from sterile
meditations about my enigmatic life...

85
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,232
It was...

86
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:19,206
in 1593,

87
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,664
period.

88
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,040
Rafael, silence!

89
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,297
Four years had gone by...

90
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,221
One day he told me to get dressed
to go for a walk with him.

91
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,019
His order surprised me because
it was a school day

92
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,106
and he'd never paid that kind
of attention to me before...

93
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,819
Do you want to come see something?

94
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,446
Come, come!

95
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,911
It's my father...

96
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,292
Joao, that's enough.

97
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,295
Don't you want to play with me?

98
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,263
I can't.

99
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,015
Goodbye.

100
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,704
Show your respect.

101
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,876
It's her!
The lady from the other night!

102
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,210
Quiet!

103
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,379
Do you want something?

104
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,381
No, sir. Just to rest.

105
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,056
But if we're bothering you,
we'll leave.

106
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,808
Who was that lady?

107
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,147
Why did she come see me?

108
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:51,890
That lady is your mother.

109
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,145
I knew it as soon as
I saw her! I was certain of it!

110
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,687
So, that man...

111
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,907
No. He's not your father.
Your father is no longer living.

112
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:01,566
That man is your mother's husband.

113
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,195
Now don't ask me any more questions,
because I won't answer.

114
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,448
Days later, they came to announce

115
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,794
that there was a man in the
entrance hall asking to see me.

116
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:29,430
Master Joao, the son of my dear Lady,
the son of that Saint!

117
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,598
I'm sorry, but who are you?

118
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,523
I am Bernardo, the Countess's
manservant.

119
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,782
I came to deliver a letter,

120
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,451
but when my Lady said you were here,

121
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,613
I couldn't
resist meeting you myself...

122
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,665
"My little knight."

123
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,955
If you only knew how much that soul
has suffered for you...

124
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,926
So you must know her well!
You can tell me everything.

125
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:04,381
Come. Let's go to my room.
We'll be more comfortable.

126
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,815
That man is a tiger.

127
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,400
He had the Countess locked up
for eight years.

128
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,775
Without seeing the sun or the moon!

129
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,575
Eight years...

130
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,488
So that's why she has
come to see me now.

131
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,281
But why did the Count lock her up?

132
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,000
That's a good one!

133
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,377
It was because of you!

134
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,381
Because of me?!

135
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,000
But he doesn't know me...

136
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,543
He's never seen me.

137
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,467
But he knows that you exist.

138
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,885
He found out, or someone told him,

139
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,350
that the Countess had borne
another man's child.

140
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,265
And that was enough for him.
That beast!

141
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,106
And this man...

142
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,146
my father...

143
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,614
Did you know him?

144
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,117
I never had that pleasure.

145
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,903
But you know who he was?

146
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:15,001
Again, no. The one who knows all this
is Father Dinis.

147
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,539
So you were here!

148
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,049
I've been looking for you for hours.

149
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,917
I brought him here.

150
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,591
It doesn't matter. Forget it.

151
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,593
Here is my reply to the Countess.

152
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,971
Be prudent.

153
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,395
Make sure she burns it
after it has been read.

154
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,852
You may leave. Go with God.

155
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,349
May God watch over you, child.

156
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,850
When shall you return?

157
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,811
You will return, won't you?

158
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,187
If the Father allows...

159
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,485
We'll talk later.

160
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,319
You should go, the Countess
is awaiting an answer.

161
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,162
Goodbye, child.

162
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,456
Your blessing, Father.

163
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,795
Here.

164
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,464
It's a letter from your mother.

165
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:05,835
It's not addressed to you, but I think
it's time you knew

166
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,837
what a bitter life she has.

167
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,513
Read it and ask God to have mercy
upon the person who wrote it.

168
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,823
The Count suspected it.

169
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,777
He wanted to wrench the secret
from me of the two people

170
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:32,778
he had seen from the window

171
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,536
He locked me back in the room.

172
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,331
Then he placed a dagger over my heart.

173
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,292
I was certain he was going to kill me.

174
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,632
I begged for my life to be taken.

175
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,254
He spat in my face,
while deciding not to kill me.

176
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,889
Was it cowardice?

177
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,846
Was it the pleasure
of seeing me suffer?

178
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,144
Who told you to leave here?

179
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,523
Did I tell you to leave?
I didn't tell you, did I?

180
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,440
Who told you to leave here?

181
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,901
Do you want me to shut you in here,
is that it?

182
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,278
Is that what you want?
Is that what you prefer?

183
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,075
Is that what you prefer?
It is, isn't it?

184
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:19,292
On the floor, right now!
On the floor, immediately!

185
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:20,580
On the floor!

186
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,162
Kill me!

187
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,289
But you want this don't you?

188
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,915
Kill me!

189
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,291
You want this, is that right?

190
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,416
You want me to kill you, is that it?

191
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:30,214
I beg you!

192
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,212
I'm begging you...

193
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,590
You're not going to leave here!

194
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:36,388
- You're not getting out of here!
- Kill me!

195
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,725
Stop!

196
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,805
Don't do this!

197
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,023
Let me go!

198
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,160
And you, what are you doing here?

199
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,361
Get moving! Get out of here!

200
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,081
Get out of here now! Get out!

201
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,257
You've already been told not to leave
your chambers!

202
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,433
Please!

203
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,718
My soul covered itself
in a veil of sadness

204
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,767
the moment I read
my mother's letter.

205
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,974
Every morning I would ask
Father Dinis about hen

206
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,570
For months I had no
news, neither good nor bad.

207
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,957
Bernardo!

208
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,211
What's going on?
Has something happened?

209
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:52,549
The lady, your mother... The Count,
the King... The Countess...

210
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,889
The what?... My mother what?...
What did the Count do?

211
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,306
Now, Bernardo, easy, go on.
Your mother wants to see you.

212
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,561
See me? Where?
Did the Count let her go free?

213
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,643
The Count left. He went with the King.
With the troops.

214
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,437
It seems Don Pedro's Liberals
landed up North. In Minho.

215
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,023
His Majesty went to throw them
all into the sea.

216
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,278
- The Count...
- Left? The Count went away?

217
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,197
But then why didn't my mother
come with you?

218
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,164
She wanted nothing else
more than to come.

219
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:25,205
If she hadn't been ill...

220
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:26,293
She's ill?

221
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,289
It's nothing serious. Don't worry.

222
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,209
In any event, she is in bed and
she wants you to go there.

223
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,585
I'm going right away!

224
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,055
Easy. Calm down, Joao.
No rash actions.

225
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,842
Antonia, have them prepare
the coach.

226
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:47,816
Forgive me for turning my back, it's
just not good to see a manservant cry.

227
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:35,645
As the coach approached
the little palace of Santa Barbara,

228
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:40,322
I was stuck between the fear that
the sinister building filled me with,

229
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,453
and the joy of going to see
my mother again.

230
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:49,414
But the idea that I might be able to
take refuge in her arms,

231
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,834
ended up dispelling all fears.

232
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,455
Sit down.

233
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,135
You may come in.

234
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,832
Father Dinis. Please sit down.

235
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,094
It's strange for me to be
receiving visitors.

236
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,384
I'm always...

237
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,513
afraid the Count might
appear at any moment.

238
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,391
If the troops are as numerous
as I've been told,

239
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:21,144
it's not likely the
Count will return very soon.

240
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:25,023
They spoke of three ships filled
with French and English mercenaries.

241
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,994
This war might last a lot
longer than we all imagined.

242
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,621
May God hear you...

243
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:38,288
However long it lasts, it won't
make up for the years I lost with my son...

244
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,093
Bernardo! Bernardo!
See if it's her. Hurry!

245
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,765
"Her"?

246
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:53,223
"Her" who, Countess,
if I'm not indiscrete?

247
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:59,351
Eugenia. The maid who lives
with the Count.

248
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,107
The Count lives with a maid?

249
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:09,110
I say maid but,

250
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,953
in fact, I am the maid,

251
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,573
and she is the Lady.

252
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,669
She is in charge here.
She decides everything.

253
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,956
It wasn't her, Countess.
Just a quarrel between two kitchen girls.

254
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,710
She hasn't left the Count's room
since he went away.

255
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,424
A good thing...

256
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:39,190
Perhaps I can breathe freely
for another day or two.

257
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,142
After what I've seen and heard,

258
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,566
I can't leave you alone
in this house.

259
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,948
But this is my house!

260
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,656
It's the only one I have.

261
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,201
Where would you have me go,
Father Dinis?

262
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,584
He who sheltered the child can
also shelter the mother.

263
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:07,043
Father Dinis, your generosity
confounds me.

264
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,388
And it shames me.
I'm not worthy of it.

265
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:15,347
Please allow me to be the judge
of what you deserve.

266
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,270
But what will the rest of the world say?

267
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,274
Have you already thought
of the slanders, the moral outrage?

268
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:25,143
The rest of the world is not under
my jurisdiction, Countess.

269
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,738
I am accountable to a
considerably higher power.

270
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:32,363
Please, mother, accept.
This way I can see you every day.

271
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,831
Do you think it's possible?
Do you think we can do it?

272
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:43,170
I think we must.

273
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,544
When?

274
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:52,592
Right away.

275
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,017
Bernardo!

276
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,270
Bring me my cape, please.

277
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,982
May I take a trunk?

278
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:09,905
Naturally.

279
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,236
I shall take it.

280
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,863
Thank you.

281
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,036
Let us go.

282
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,220
For my happiness to be complete,

283
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,065
I only needed to meet the other
half of my story

284
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:50,104
I didn't dare ask my mother to talk about
the father who was "no longer living",

285
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,322
as Father Dinis had put it.

286
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,824
I didn't want to torment her with the past
that had made her suffer so much.

287
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,595
I was truly startled when I saw him...

288
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:30,395
Don't say anything to the other one.
She can't know I am here.

289
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,413
I feel so happy, I could die without fear.

290
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:48,208
Mother. Don't speak any more of death.
Promise me.

291
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:55,215
You're right, my son. I promise.

292
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:04,141
But there will come a day when,
in this hell on earth,

293
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,024
the hope of death will be a paradise
for those that are unhappy.

294
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,685
But you said you were happy!

295
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,357
And I am.

296
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,279
What are you afraid of, then?

297
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:21,612
Of the past, Pedro.

298
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,539
Of my past...

299
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,954
oh, My God!

300
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,004
What misfortune will befall upon us now?

301
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,771
The Count has returned, Countess.

302
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,432
Forgive the delay.

303
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,106
Bernardo.

304
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,902
The Count kicked me out on the street.

305
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,999
He didn't have to tell me twice. I packed
my things and moved right away.

306
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,784
If you wish, you can always stay here,
Bernardo.

307
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,254
Thank you, Father Dinis,
I already have somewhere to stay.

308
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,962
You see, Countess,
everything works out.

309
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:02,922
Your husband will leave Lisbon with
the maid shortly. You are finally free.

310
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,344
Do you really think so?

311
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,927
You don't think the man won't use
his authority

312
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,147
to snatch my son away
from my own arms?

313
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:16,600
He might try. But first he'll have to
discover where to find the Countess.

314
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,727
It won't be easy for him.

315
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,104
And if he succeeds?

316
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:24,108
If he does succeed, there are the means,
even in this poor house,

317
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,864
to place Your Excellency and
your son out of his reach,

318
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,825
some two thousand leagues
from Lisbon.

319
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:39,676
Rest easy, Countess: God's blessing did
not abandon Agar in the desert.

320
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:47,349
My child, that's quite enough tears.
It's the time for smiles.

321
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,136
Think of your son.

322
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,686
Think of the future.

323
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:04,356
Father Dinis kept his reticent manner
every time I touched on the matter.

324
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,734
But I insisted so much that one day..

325
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:07,861
Pedro!

326
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,031
Angela!

327
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,623
Pedro, I called you because your mother
has authorized me to tell you

328
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:23,844
what you keep wanting to know,
what you insisted to know.

329
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,628
Let's go to my office.

330
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:29,975
Angela!

331
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,396
It seems to me your mother
is not feeling well.

332
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,019
Angela!

333
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:02,378
I didn't tell you before, because
this story does not only belong to me.

334
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,796
I'm telling you now,
because it also belongs to you.

335
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:12,472
The year you were born, a man came to
this house and asked to see me...

336
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,770
- Joao, why aren't you writing?
- I have no more ink!

337
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:21,856
Ink, Joao, is to be brought from home!
Come here, you're going to be punished.

338
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:31,412
He was so pale and emaciated
he seemed more like a corpse.

339
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,240
With as little noise as possible...

340
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,951
Father, there's a ghost out there!

341
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,248
Be seated!

342
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,417
Joao, go and sit down!

343
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,210
Help me here.

344
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,818
Silence!

345
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,965
My name is Pedro da Silva.

346
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,719
I am the second son of the
Count of Alvaçoes.

347
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,004
As such, I am a poor man.

348
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:39,600
I'm a sort of bastard, but I was
born from a legitimate marriage.

349
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,612
It's as if I was the son of a Shoemaker
or a pig-keeper.

350
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:51,487
But my situation only became
unbearable

351
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,247
the day I met a rather fateful woman.

352
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:13,089
The kind who carry in their first loving
look either adventure or absolute disgrace.

353
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:27,277
The woman I loved was the daughter
of the Marquis of Montezelos.

354
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,229
A second child, just like me.

355
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,325
And predestined, like myself
to misfortune.

356
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,151
Deolinda!

357
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,069
What a fright!

358
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,036
Come in.

359
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,122
What is this?

360
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,750
Don't open it here, miss.

361
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,592
It's from the nobleman you saw
yesterday. The one from church.

362
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,256
When?

363
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,680
This morning, at the market...

364
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:05,205
Be careful, miss. The Marquis has
already returned from the guild.

365
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,675
Most Excellent Lady

366
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,600
Forgive my audacity in sending you
this letter.

367
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:30,182
But nothing could keep me away
from the gaze I discovered yesterday

368
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,730
and dreamed of today

369
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,984
Ever since I saw you in church

370
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:40,035
I could not rest until I knew
to whom such enchantment belonged.

371
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,908
My minutes seem like hours.

372
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,744
My hours, like days.

373
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,869
This will endure until you have the
kindness to receive me.

374
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:52,923
For this reason, without calculation
and in all innocence,

375
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,835
I dare to ask you to
relieve me from this torment.

376
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,004
Yours,

377
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,677
Pedro da Silva.

378
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:04,568
At first, Father, it was a dream
without any repercussions.

379
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:08,745
A subtle drunkenness of the heart,
without the delirium of the senses.

380
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,909
A truly burning desire for happiness,

381
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,789
without imagining what happiness
should be for us...

382
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,633
If you'd care to rest a moment.

383
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,551
I'm sorry, no. It's nothing.
Don't worry.

384
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,599
I would rather finish my story,

385
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,977
I don't wish to occupy any more
of your time.

386
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:47,242
Later on, there was a shyness to
our relationship. Blushing for no reason.

387
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,289
A lowering of the eyes
in each ether's presence.

388
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:57,964
It was, in the end, a struggle
between the heart and the head,

389
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,299
between innocence and calculation.

390
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:05,760
Between the sanctity of our affection
and the demon of social convention.

391
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:12,687
We saw each other almost every day
at the same place.

392
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,987
Enough to be sure that we wanted to
spend the rest of our lives together.

393
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:24,654
Yes.

394
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,078
I had already sworn thus
before you asked me.

395
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,282
I want to be yours.

396
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,711
In body and soul.

397
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,836
In life and in death.

398
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,298
I'm asking your father to allow
me an audience with him today.

399
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,131
I'm afraid, Pedro, I'm afraid.

400
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,679
Afraid of what, my love?

401
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,769
Afraid of what?

402
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:59,685
When one is in love as we are,
there's no reason to be afraid!

403
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,440
Right?

404
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,996
I love you so much...

405
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:38,708
Sir marquis...

406
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,623
Don Pedro.

407
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,045
Come.

408
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,853
You wanted to have a word.

409
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:03,108
And I received you out of deference
to your present situation,

410
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,269
although I feel it would be best
if you give up this charade.

411
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,897
But, Sir Marquis...

412
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,150
Believe me, it's better this way.

413
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:15,026
We can both avoid a rather
embarrassing moment.

414
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:20,329
You, asking for my daughter's hand,
and I, having to refuse you.

415
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,289
I shall only give my daughter away
to the man who meets two conditions.

416
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:31,459
First: he has to prove to me that he is
as noble as she is.

417
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,713
And second: he must be wealthy enough

418
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:38,344
to give her everything I have given her
until now.

419
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:44,099
Your Excellency certainly satisfies
the first condition.

420
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,401
However, the second, you do not.

421
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:54,067
My daughter is poor, Don Pedro da Silva.
Your Excellency is poor.

422
00:44:56,194 --> 00:45:01,416
And neither I, nor your father can steal
from our firstborn children

423
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,577
to benefit the second.

424
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,251
Goodbye, Don Pedro.
It was a great pleasure.

425
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,652
It's best if you leave through this garden,
one never knows.

426
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,897
That is all.

427
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,822
Excuse me.

428
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,283
Angela, my girl!

429
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,376
Mother!

430
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,630
It's nothing.

431
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,962
Just dizziness, that's all.

432
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:37,091
From all the emotion.

433
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,512
Please continue, Father.

434
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,644
Don't worry about me.
Please continue.

435
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,104
All right, I shall continue,
but in your room.

436
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,058
You look tired.

437
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,560
I want you to rest.

438
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:56,314
Come, let's go, Countess.
Let's go.

439
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:02,986
Curiously, Don Pedro felt ill
at the same point in his tale.

440
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,989
I settled him on that very same sofa.

441
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:11,170
But he refused to rest until he had
finished telling me his story.

442
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,170
I had really embarrassed myself

443
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,173
I was tempted to take revenge.

444
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:23,717
To make his face flush with shame!
That father who had shamed me first.

445
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,598
But the struggle between pride and
dishonor did not last long.

446
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:34,477
I decided to leave for America,
where much gold had been found,

447
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,776
and where they had conquered
the European notion of social status.

448
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,650
A place where they trade
even human beings.

449
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:46,622
A place you later leave to get a
diploma as an honest man in Portugal.

450
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,038
I'm leaving for America.

451
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,002
I'll kill myself.

452
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:02,972
- Angela!
- If you leave, I'll kill myself.

453
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,685
My father will force me
to marry someone else.

454
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:15,894
I'd rather die.

455
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:19,272
Angela, wait. Angela!

456
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,593
You're burning with a fever.

457
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,973
It's nothing. I've been like this for
months. Don't worry.

458
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,783
I abandoned my plans,

459
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,703
of course.

460
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,869
I couldn't abandon her like that.

461
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:15,370
I was sure she would put into practice
what she had threatened to do.

462
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,831
As a result of Deolinda's complicity

463
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:23,837
Angela began to receive me at home,
every time her father was away.

464
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:29,382
We played silly games together
and dreamt of an unexpected fortune

465
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,181
and of escaping to another land...

466
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:36,019
Young lady! Don Pedro! Hurry!
It's the marquis!

467
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:59,254
At first, our meetings were
pure, almost fraternal.

468
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:04,173
But little by little,
the angel of innocence abandoned us.

469
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:08,927
And the impetuous voice of passion
spoke louder.

470
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:13,307
And neither Angela nor I knew
how to resist it.

471
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:08,088
Bastard.

472
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,573
No.

473
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,664
Don't cry, Mother...

474
00:52:41,665 --> 00:52:43,036
Come, my girl,
you must be strong.

475
00:52:43,037 --> 00:52:45,379
I'm sorry.
It is too strong for me...

476
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:49,165
When I heard those shots,
I thought I was going to die!

477
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,418
My father had dismissed Deolinda,
and had locked me in my room.

478
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,046
Let's stop for now.
Let's let her rest.

479
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,766
No! Please, Father,
I beg you to continue.

480
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,144
I beg you to continue, please.

481
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,063
I want my son to know
who his father was.

482
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,433
I know I don't have the strength
to tell him myself.

483
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:11,564
Please continue Father.
I beg you to continue, for me.

484
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,627
Good morning.

485
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:33,586
What happened to me?

486
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,884
You lost consciousness, my friend.

487
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,387
No, no, no! Don't move.

488
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,137
You're in no condition to get up.

489
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,350
Can you move your arm?

490
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,361
No.

491
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,947
You haven't lost much blood.

492
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:58,027
The doctor will be back this afternoon
to examine you again.

493
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,489
Now, eat. You need to regain
your strength.

494
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:17,044
In the weeks that I lay
between life and death,

495
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,468
the Marquis of Montezelos
forced Angela to enter a convent.

496
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:24,679
You should rest assured that
at least there she is protected.

497
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:30,393
No doubt, Father.
But only a temporary protection.

498
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,271
Her father's intention was
to have her removed from there

499
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,821
as soon as he arranged her a husband.

500
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,028
Which convent?

501
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:45,157
The convent is the reason
that I came to see you.

502
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,668
I heard you had a sister
in the same place.

503
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,835
The Convent of Nazaré...

504
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:02,137
Unfortunately I arrived too late.

505
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,640
The Marquis came to take her
away two days ago.

506
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:10,395
For weeks, she remained in
a very bad state.

507
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,193
She cried all day, the poor thing.

508
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,813
And she didn't trust any one of us.

509
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,363
Not even the prelate
could reach her.

510
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,692
Do you know where they took her?

511
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,411
Home, I suppose.

512
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,863
But I can find out, if you want.

513
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,116
Then find out.

514
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,919
I fear the worst, Antonia.

515
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:35,124
For her, and for the other life
she carries in her bosom.

516
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,593
Most Holy Virgin!

517
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,351
May God protect her!

518
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:58,072
It's from Miss Antonia!
She said it's urgent.

519
00:55:58,397 --> 00:55:59,444
Thank you.

520
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,492
You may go.

521
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,830
My sister Antonia told me that the
Marquis of Montezelos

522
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:16,625
had secretly sent his daughter to a ranch
he owns about 25 leagues from Lisbon.

523
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,678
Good morning, brother!

524
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:30,052
Might there be a drop of water to give
these poor beasts?

525
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,896
We'll pay, of course.

526
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,058
They haven't drunk since sunrise.

527
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,777
They're dying of thirst.

528
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,023
This isn't a public drinking place.

529
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,364
And I am no brother to any gypsy.

530
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,868
Go on, keep moving on your way.

531
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:57,290
There's a stream down there.
Less than two leagues away.

532
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,666
The water is free of charge.
And the information as well.

533
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,543
Be well.

534
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:03,136
Thank you, brother.

535
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,360
Have a swig, to compensate for
our inconvenience.

536
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,358
It's the good stuff.

537
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:28,032
It may not quench your thirst,
but it'll give you a kick.

538
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:34,201
If I don't drink, you're going to think
I'm being arrogant.

539
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:46,630
That is the good stuff!

540
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,683
If you want more, just come around.

541
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:53,938
I'll be up there, on Mule Mountain,
beyond the tree grove.

542
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,269
Just ask for me: Sabine Cabra.

543
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,440
I might come visit, you never know...

544
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,822
If I get thirsty and I have the urge...

545
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:09,495
My name is Heliodoro. But everyone
knows me as Knife-Eater.

546
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:14,082
The name isn't that pretty,
but it fits the person that I am.

547
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:18,370
I'll wait to see you there.
Stay in peace.

548
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,141
Oh, it's you! You scared me, man.
I didn't hear you coming.

549
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:35,058
People only hear me coming when
I want them to.

550
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:38,853
Sit down.

551
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,143
Are you alone?

552
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,487
Better alone...

553
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,818
That's right.

554
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,445
I was going to eat.
Will you join me?

555
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,279
It's meat.
Some people don't like it.

556
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,033
Stones are the only thing I don't eat.

557
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:14,222
But this horse business,
does it work or not?

558
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:17,803
It's working out.

559
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,056
To be honest, my friend Heliodoro...

560
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,559
Call me Knife-Eater!

561
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,685
Otherwise I'll think you're talking
to someone else.

562
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,780
Knife-Eater, my friend.

563
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:33,242
Let's just say if I sold only the ones
I buy and the ones I raise,

564
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,198
you might well say
that I would die of hunger.

565
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:40,494
But counting on others,
I can't complain.

566
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,703
Which "others"?

567
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:43,956
The ones I End...

568
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:44,922
Where?

569
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,084
Wherever...

570
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,753
The ones you "find"!

571
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,637
What about you?

572
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,845
More or less like you.

573
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,063
Like me?

574
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:08,479
Like this: I made a treaty with the
marquis down there...

575
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,982
The one with the farm.

576
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:15,325
When he has a problem,
I solve it for him.

577
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,082
And it works out for you?

578
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:21,710
Yes.

579
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:26,043
It's better than walking around
planting seeds in the ground.

580
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,546
Which is what I used to do...

581
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,344
Right now I have a special job
from him.

582
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,844
And this one is going to be a
real piece of work, seriously...

583
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,515
A special one...

584
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,137
It's the Marquis' daughter.

585
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,554
No!

586
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,812
His actual daughter!?

587
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,484
The girl is... you know...

588
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:51,944
And the father's unknown.

589
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,825
The finer they are,
the more they're like goats.

590
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,328
Unless it is... No offense...

591
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,783
And so?

592
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,333
And so?
The baby's a bastard, man!

593
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,382
But it's almost born, almost.

594
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:15,263
And when it's born, two shovelfuls
of dirt and it's all over.

595
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,175
At that age,
it doesn't have an age at all.

596
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,679
Nor a size! Not even a sin!

597
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,854
Just a tiny grain of sand...
in this entire desert...

598
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:30,859
When it comes out: Whoosh!
It will go straight to Heaven.

599
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,750
Was it me? Was I the bastard?

600
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:52,926
In the eyes of the Lord, there are
no bastards, nor second children.

601
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,712
We are all firstborn.

602
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,340
But I was the one
he was supposed to kill?

603
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,434
What are you doing here?

604
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,476
The Marquis doesn't like visitors.

605
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:11,518
Luckily, he's not here,
but he might have been.

606
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,237
Good morning, brother.

607
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:16,482
I already told you I'm not your brother.

608
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,652
It's not from drinking two glasses
together that we're now the same blood.

609
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:20,905
What do you want?

610
01:02:20,906 --> 01:02:23,077
I came here to make you
a business proposition.

611
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,367
A business proposition?

612
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:28,041
What business?

613
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:31,622
I don't buy or sell horses and
I don't steal them, either.

614
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:32,875
What about bastards?

615
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:37,129
What did you say?
What is that all about?

616
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:40,299
You told me yourself, last night.

617
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,384
You shouldn't drink.

618
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:48,182
Lower your voice, you fool!
What else did I tell you?

619
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:53,395
Isn't there a place
where we can speak in peace?

620
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:56,611
What I want to propose
shouldn't be done here.

621
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,777
Come on, then.

622
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,320
Thank you, brother.

623
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,629
Sit down over there.

624
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,182
What's that?

625
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:25,264
Open it.

626
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,213
Count them.

627
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,083
I have just as many more on me.

628
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:03,761
If it's more than the Marquis gives you,
then the bastard is mine.

629
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:13,271
The bastard is yours?

630
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,275
Why do you want it?

631
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,447
What purpose does it serve you?

632
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,617
That's up to me. Don't worry.

633
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,454
But if you're not interested
in the deal...

634
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,537
Hey, hold on!

635
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,753
Who said I wasn't interested?

636
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,851
There must be around 40 coins here!

637
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,851
Eighty, counting the ones I have on me.

638
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,856
But that's a lot of money!

639
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,988
He's worth that much?

640
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:03,446
To you, he's worth it.

641
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:07,530
And you avoid having one more crime
on your conscience.

642
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,077
Come on, decide!
I have the horses waiting.

643
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:17,755
It's decided.

644
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:28,933
Forty it is then, brother.

645
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:50,289
Bread, sausage, brother.

646
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:54,116
He sold me to Father Dinis,
is that it?

647
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:55,325
Who?

648
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,077
The gypsy. That animal.

649
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,454
He saved my life...

650
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,583
He bought me from the assassin,
and sold me to Father Dinis.

651
01:06:00,584 --> 01:06:02,459
It was like that, wasn't it?

652
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:05,095
No, it wasn't quite like that.

653
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:08,431
But the story has gone on for
too long now, and it's late.

654
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,845
Your mother is exhausted.
Come on, we'll let her rest.

655
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:18,850
Sleep well, mother.

656
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,567
I doubt it, my son.

657
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:29,407
But just knowing you're nearby will
make my insomnia more bearable.

658
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,990
Good night, Father Dinis.

659
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,493
Good night, Countess.

660
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,381
Can I ask you one more question,
Father?

661
01:06:49,382 --> 01:06:51,132
It's the last one, I swear.

662
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,511
What about my father?

663
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:01,026
God allowed your father to see his
son and kiss him before leaving.

664
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:05,818
He died two days after
you arrived in this house.

665
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:10,275
He was still able to dictate
a letter for the Countess,

666
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:13,530
in which he declared that the boy
was safe and sound.

667
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:19,411
He left this world
with your mother's name on his lips.

668
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:25,258
He was a just and virtuous
man who was unfortunate.

669
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,297
Don't be embarrassed in being his son.

670
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:33,674
Now go to sleep!

671
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:36,176
Tomorrow eight o'clock. Botany.

672
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,554
You know I don't like you to be late.

673
01:07:37,555 --> 01:07:39,306
See you tomorrow, Father.

674
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:42,229
Before leaving Lisbon with Eugenia,

675
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,851
the Count of Santa Barbara
told everyone

676
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,946
that my mother had
abandoned him for another man.

677
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,907
Within the upper social circles
of Lisbon,

678
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:53,193
my mother became the ignoble
topic of conversation

679
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,162
in the salons and city squares.

680
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:59,167
She's even my cousin,
imagine that!

681
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:05,174
Two or three times removed,
in truth, but regardless to say...

682
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:12,010
- I heard that the man is a priest.
- My God! What a shameful thing.

683
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,308
It seems that even
before she was married she...

684
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:19,386
Alas, what is certain
is that her father,

685
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:23,390
the poor Marquis of Montezelos,
my father's distant cousin,

686
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:27,441
forced her to enter a convent,
before arranging her a husband.

687
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,149
What do you suppose was the reason?

688
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:33,826
The reason is that she was...
You know...

689
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:38,739
It was the Count of Santa Barbara
himself who told my husband...

690
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,157
Poor man.

691
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:44,413
Apparently tears came to his eyes.
He's an absolute mess.

692
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:47,624
I heard that he even left Lisbon
altogether.

693
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:52,794
He left to join the troops
of King Don Miguel, in Minho.

694
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,012
In the condition I saw him,

695
01:08:54,013 --> 01:08:56,804
I wouldn't be surprise if he did
something foolish.

696
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:01,138
Who is that tall gentleman, Marquise?

697
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,764
I never saw him here before.

698
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:05,392
And he has a foreign air about him.

699
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,110
The Brazilian.

700
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,936
His name is Alberto de Magalhaes.

701
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:14,113
They say he's the bastard son
of King Don Joao VI

702
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:17,199
and an attendant of Queen Dona Maria.

703
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:22,075
If one look's closely, in fact,
the lower lip is just like the Braganças.

704
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:27,162
What is certain is that
not long ago he came from Brazil

705
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,007
and that he has money to burn.

706
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:34,637
To me, as far as I can tell,
he's a liberal. A spy for Don Pedro.

707
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,298
And that his fortune will only
allow him

708
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:41,052
to bring down the court
and the altar as well.

709
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:44,268
That is what they told my husband,
from a trustworthy source.

710
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:49,398
Neither royal bastard, nor liberal spy,
my dear ladies.

711
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:54,612
I am sorry to disappoint you,
but my information is trustworthy.

712
01:09:55,942 --> 01:10:02,826
Your Mr. Alberto de Magalhaes
got rich in the ignoble slave trade.

713
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:08,203
And nowadays, he maintains his fortune
through piracy.

714
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,753
How horrible!
Could it actually be possible?

715
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:15,428
I've already heard those rumors,
Don Martinho.

716
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,255
And I don't believe them.

717
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:22,310
My husband would never have agreed
to receive a man of that ilk.

718
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:32,361
Would you be so kind as to bring me
my handkerchief, Don Martinho?

719
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,647
I left it on that table.

720
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,239
Certainly.

721
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,284
What are you smiling about,
Mr. Alberto de Magalhaes?

722
01:10:44,285 --> 01:10:45,534
Can you tell me?

723
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,118
About you Your Excellency, Countess.

724
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:49,211
About me?

725
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,540
Or people in general,
if your prefer, Countess.

726
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,000
I do not understand.

727
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,378
Neither do I.

728
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:00,422
I thought about what Your Excellency
had said a moment ago

729
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:02,391
about the Countess of Santa Barbara.

730
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,182
And that makes you smile?

731
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:10,312
That the poor Countess
of Santa Barbara

732
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:13,395
is the "shame of the
Portuguese nobility"?

733
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,774
Does Your Excellency think
we should all take this so seriously?

734
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,447
I did not ask for your...

735
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:31,750
I do not ask your opinion, sir.

736
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,009
I only ask for the respect of not
laughing at my opinion.

737
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:40,263
You ask too much of me,
Your Excellency.

738
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,141
It's difficult not to laugh at something
so laughable.

739
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,018
This is an insult!

740
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:49,438
To the Countess, I say it's not.

741
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:54,186
To Your Excellency,
I say interpret it as you wish.

742
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:00,107
I take it as a provocation!

743
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:03,193
And I feel I have the right
to demand some explanations!

744
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:06,038
You do not have to touch me,
Don Martinho de Almeida.

745
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:13,087
Nonsense like that
can be spoken from a distance.

746
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,092
Pardon me, Your Excellency,

747
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:30,097
but you have a note at your feet.

748
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:34,021
If it's not from your husband,

749
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:37,649
it might be an outrage to the
principles you yourself proclaim!

750
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,366
Dear Friend,
I wait impatiently for the moment

751
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,210
when I can hold you tightly
in my arms again.

752
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:17,642
Don Martinho de Almeida instructed us
to ask Your Excellency:

753
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:20,687
With whom we should negotiate
the conditions of the duel.

754
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:21,814
With me.

755
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,694
Your Excellency, forgive me,
but that is not standard practice.

756
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:30,405
You must subject yourself
to the conditions that are imposed

757
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,407
by two gentlemen whom you trust.

758
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,661
That is precisely why I do not concede
to anyone.

759
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:38,164
I am the one who imposes
obligations of honor.

760
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,042
I am in full use of my capacities.

761
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,920
I answer for myself: I do not fight.

762
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:47,720
You don't fight?
You don't fight?

763
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,596
No.

764
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:54,226
Have you seriously considered the
consequences of this decision?

765
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,099
What consequences?

766
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:01,233
The risk of an unexpected
encounter, which could be fatal...

767
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:04,657
I assume that risk.

768
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,318
Is that all?

769
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:08,535
No, no.

770
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:11,739
I haven't yet wished you
a very nice day.

771
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:21,253
Good morning, boss.

772
01:14:21,254 --> 01:14:22,707
Good morning Mr. Joao.

773
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,301
Mr. Paulo, Mr. Raul.

774
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,430
That was not the case with Father Dinis.

775
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:30,933
He had also heard the rumors
that were spreading through Lisbon.

776
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,469
Without saying a word to my mother,

777
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,222
he presented a case
against the Count of Santa Barbara

778
01:14:36,223 --> 01:14:40,272
at the court which deals with abuse,
and punishes slanderers.

779
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:45,073
He called for justice, and that the Count
prove his slanderous claim, or recant.

780
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,776
Informed that the Count had taken ill
during the journey

781
01:14:49,777 --> 01:14:52,112
and was convalescing in an Inn
in Santarem,

782
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:55,031
father Dinis didn't hesitate
to take a trip there,

783
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:58,118
accompanied by a bailiff
and a registrar.

784
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:01,246
He was determined to put an end,
without delay

785
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,841
to the offense inflicted
on the honor of his protege.

786
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:21,307
I am sorry, gentlemen, but the Count
is in no condition to receive visitors.

787
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,143
This isn't a visit, dear sir.

788
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:25,647
This is a matter of judicial diligence.

789
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:29,524
Forgive me, Father, but
wouldn't it be better

790
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,152
to wait for a
more auspicious moment?

791
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:33,653
No, Registrar.

792
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,203
The person I represent has already
waited far too long.

793
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:16,993
Count,

794
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,366
this gentleman is the Registrar
of the Third Order,

795
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,869
and this other one is the bailiff.

796
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:24,203
They have been empowered with a
diligence,

797
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:26,173
to be collected from Your Excellency.

798
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:30,382
Diligence?! Third Order?!
What is this all about?

799
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:32,837
I don't owe anything to anyone.

800
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:35,182
This is not about a debt, Count.

801
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:40,604
Your Excellency, forgive me.
I come involuntarily to charge you.

802
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:45,484
I was sent here at the request of the
Countess of Santa Barbara.

803
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,073
What does that woman want from me?

804
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,160
She wants the Count
to respect her honor.

805
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:08,292
Who are you, sir?!
I know you. I've seen you before!

806
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,918
You've seen me, indeed.

807
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:14,379
But where?
Where have I seen you?

808
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,553
You saw me in front of your house.
In the garden.

809
01:17:16,554 --> 01:17:19,425
Yes, yes, with a little boy...
I remember well. But before that?

810
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:21,144
It was before, long before...

811
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:23,476
It's possible.

812
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,561
It will come back to me.

813
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:31,984
I'll remember.

814
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:35,651
I don't understand.

815
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:39,197
What do you have to do with this matter,
with the court, and its jurisdiction?

816
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:44,784
I am here in the capacity of protector
of the Countess of Santa Barbara.

817
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:48,329
I am the vigilant sentinel of her honor
and I can point out,

818
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:52,709
without hesitation, that I protect
your honor as well, Your Excellency.

819
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,509
For my honor!
You're mocking me, Father.

820
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,639
No, no. I am not mocking you.

821
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,216
I know that Your Excellency
was not the only one

822
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:03,178
who was responsible for the misfortunes
of the Countess.

823
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,471
And I also know that you were
a puppet

824
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:08,683
in the hands of her father,
the Marquis of Montezelos.

825
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:11,654
You know that? You know that?

826
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:15,441
So, I was right.

827
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:17,576
We have seen each other before.

828
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:19,537
I know you!

829
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:21,493
It's possible.

830
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:27,499
Eugenia. Gentlemen.

831
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:33,505
I beg you to leave me for a moment with
the priest.

832
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,552
Eugenia, you may leave.

833
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,095
I will sign anything you want.

834
01:18:38,096 --> 01:18:40,090
But first, I must speak with him alone.

835
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:41,842
Would you leave, please?

836
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,105
Sit down.

837
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:12,381
I am sorry. I feel like I'm suffocating.

838
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:16,798
What did the doctor say?

839
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:23,675
That this is an extraordinary case,
and he delays his diagnosis,

840
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:25,517
because he wants to consult
his colleagues.

841
01:19:25,518 --> 01:19:26,763
In other words: he doesn't know.

842
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:30,266
But let us forget about all that.

843
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:33,815
It's strange, I have such a strong
impression that I know you,

844
01:19:33,816 --> 01:19:35,813
but I am not able to remember.

845
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:44,872
You mean to say you're aware the
Marquis of Montezelos was my tutor?

846
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:46,824
I am.

847
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:55,292
You're right, it's true. He treated me
like a puppet.

848
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:00,888
I was practically a child.
Frivolous, foolhardy.

849
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:06,473
I only thought about racing dogs and
Arabian horses.

850
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:09,146
He spoke to me of his daughter.

851
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,308
He wanted to introduce her to me.

852
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:16,028
I had heard a vague story about a
convent...

853
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:18,189
I resisted him.

854
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,692
I would invent excuses.

855
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,536
The last thing on my mind
was getting married.

856
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:28,991
One day he took me to the Ball of the
Count of Colares.

857
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:35,204
She was a fascinating figure,
a mixture of richness and beauty that

858
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:36,707
completely astonished me.

859
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:52,764
This is the latest fashion in the salons.
Dancing African Lunduns.

860
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:55,234
Is it also a fashion to go around
pointing fingers?

861
01:20:55,235 --> 01:20:57,477
My butler is the culprit,
he is a deaf-mute.

862
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:59,822
The poor man can't say anything
so he points instead.

863
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:03,900
Now, everyone points.
It seems to be fashion.

864
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:05,401
But it is very ugly, is it not?

865
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:06,779
If it's the fashion, it's the fashion.

866
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,998
Do you really think so?

867
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:14,494
You'll see the good it does you.
Just for one night,

868
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:18,545
trading horses and dogs for men
in elegant clothes and beautiful women.

869
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:44,524
Something happened?
Are you feeling all right?

870
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:48,945
Who is that woman talking to those two
ladies over there?

871
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:50,072
Do you know her?

872
01:21:50,073 --> 01:21:52,621
That's my daughter, Angela.
You've never seen her?

873
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:54,626
I don't believe so.

874
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,787
At least I've never seen her with the
eyes I have today.

875
01:21:57,788 --> 01:22:00,917
I was just about to introduce you. Come.

876
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:15,397
I don't feel well, Father.

877
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:18,683
I wanted to ask for
your permission to retire...

878
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,732
Angela! You promised me.

879
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:25,815
You don't feel well because you're all
alone here.

880
01:22:25,816 --> 01:22:28,484
I've brought you just the right company.

881
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:30,069
The Count of Santa Barbara.

882
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:32,823
A dear friend.
And an admirer of yours.

883
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:38,494
Good. Well, I'll leave you two to
get acquainted.

884
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:41,669
The company of old people isn't healthy
for the young.

885
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,585
Don't make me look bad.

886
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,929
So long. Enjoy yourselves.

887
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:52,559
Don't you like dancing?

888
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:57,231
It doesn't really speak to me anymore.

889
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:03,477
I don't even know if I still know how.

890
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:04,696
I never knew...

891
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:12,028
But I know how to hunt boar and ride
without a saddle...

892
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:16,240
Do you like horses?
I have two thoroughbreds.

893
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:19,243
I brought them from Marrakesh.
They cost me an arm and a leg.

894
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:22,293
They're the most elegant horses in
all of Lisbon.

895
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:26,093
I'd like you to see them, but
I don't allow anyone to ride them.

896
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:34,510
But for you, young lady, I might be
convinced to allow.

897
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:36,979
If it pleases you, of course.

898
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:49,321
You should not be interested in me,
Count.

899
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:52,569
You shouldn't.

900
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:57,374
My heart is dead.

901
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,297
It's too late, Angela.
My heart already belongs to you.

902
01:24:05,298 --> 01:24:07,463
- It's been yours since I first saw you.
- Don't say that.

903
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:09,465
Don't do that.

904
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:16,928
You can't...

905
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:23,776
I can't. I Can't!

906
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:28,938
Seen from close up,
the heart increased in value

907
01:24:28,939 --> 01:24:31,692
what it had lost in the
caliber of her eyes.

908
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:36,448
She was a woman to be seen,
but she was more to be loved...

909
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,914
So, you talked?

910
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:45,589
Your daughter, Marquis,
isn't much for conversation.

911
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:59,093
Don't tell me she didn't talk to you.

912
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,596
Obviously, I don't interest her.

913
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:03,106
That nonsense!
Of course you interest her.

914
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:06,147
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

915
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,877
She had a shrine of lost love in her soul.

916
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:09,582
And they turned it into a cup of bile...

917
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:11,963
What?

918
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:19,968
I'm talking about Angela de Lima,
Count of Santa Barbara.

919
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:24,931
They turned the love she had in her soul
into a cup of bile.

920
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:30,482
Do you also want to place yourself into
the heart of that unhappy girl?

921
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,904
Leave her, Count.

922
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:39,568
The memory of a first love,
the corpse of the first man she loved,

923
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:43,995
marked her existence with longings that
your passion can't compete against.

924
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:47,748
Leave her, for pity's sake.

925
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:53,459
Don't buy her from her father,
because you're buying a dead slave.

926
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,803
But who are you,

927
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:59,927
how did you know?

928
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:05,221
It doesn't matter. I am a friend.

929
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:23,487
Everything is cleared up, dear Count.

930
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,162
A passing indisposition.
A misunderstanding.

931
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:29,493
Go. She is waiting for you
to excuse herself.

932
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:32,498
Don't make her wait!
She'll think you're still bitter.

933
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:35,434
Count. Father.

934
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:37,904
I am sorry, but this isn't good
for the patient's condition...

935
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:39,688
Get him out of here.

936
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,566
Tell him to leave us in peace.

937
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:47,580
Please, Doctor.

938
01:28:47,581 --> 01:28:49,323
If I need you, I will call you.

939
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,042
Please, Doctor.

940
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:06,009
When I returned to Angela's side,
I found her docile and cheerful.

941
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:10,221
But the smile was forced and her
docility was really just her resignation.

942
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:14,107
I didn't want to see it then,
but now I see it much clearer.

943
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:17,399
She accepted my courtship
with a certain obedience.

944
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:24,197
I wanted her to accept me of
her own free will,

945
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:26,655
and pretended not to see the iron hand
of her father,

946
01:29:26,656 --> 01:29:28,200
who constrained her in the shadows.

947
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:32,205
I heard only my own feelings,

948
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:34,995
my selfishness,

949
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:38,210
instead of opening my ears
to that man,

950
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:42,344
the unknown man who had
approached me at the Ball.

951
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:47,345
You never saw him again?

952
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:52,183
Once. Only once.

953
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:56,479
On the eve of my marriage
to Angela de Lima.

954
01:29:59,269 --> 01:30:02,563
I had gone to finalize the preparations
for the ceremony

955
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:05,149
when I had the unusual yet
irrepressible impulse,

956
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:09,155
to ask God to bless our union.

957
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:12,624
And I recognized his voice immediately..

958
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,799
I see you haven't followed my advice,
Count of Santa Barbara.

959
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:32,139
I lament that.

960
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:35,939
For you and,
principally, for her.

961
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:41,194
This marriage will cause the disgrace
of Angela de Lima, and you, too.

962
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:47,068
If you can't find happiness
in being her executioner,

963
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:49,365
you too shall be disgraced.

964
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,196
A disgrace with no cure.

965
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:53,574
But who are you, sir?

966
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:55,701
How can you say such a thing?

967
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:57,915
What is your name?

968
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:22,353
Everything he told me, happened...

969
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,774
I tried to find out who he was...

970
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:33,622
They told me his name was
Sebastiao de Melo.

971
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:40,037
They told me the most contradictory
things about him.

972
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:44,545
I looked for him.

973
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:47,464
But no one ever saw him again.

974
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:53,096
He magically disappeared.

975
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:01,016
Naturally, he died.

976
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:06,859
No, he didn't die.
But it was as if he had.

977
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:10,317
Did you know him?

978
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:15,780
I knew him.

979
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:24,255
It's not possible!

980
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,383
Everything is possible.

981
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:31,046
That look!

982
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:34,766
That voice!

983
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,344
I knew I had seen you before!

984
01:32:39,929 --> 01:32:41,431
Sebastiao de Melo!

985
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:46,482
Father Dinis Ramalho e Sousa.

986
01:32:47,062 --> 01:32:49,781
The world now
knows me by this name.

987
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:53,285
I have asked you to come, Eugenia,

988
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:59,074
because I wanted you to bear
witness to my penance.

989
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:07,583
This is the declaration
I am prepared to sign, Mr. Registrar:

990
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:18,886
I have dishonored myself by insulting
the Countess of Santa Barbara, my wife.

991
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:25,020
I wanted her to pay for the sins of
her father,

992
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:27,819
the Marquis of Montezelos,

993
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:32,824
and so I gave her, for fifteen years,
a life of incredible bitterness.

994
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:41,830
I invented torturous methods to
humiliate her self-esteem,

995
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:46,834
and made attacks upon her dignity.

996
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:55,013
I brought her close to the grave,
and when I saw her run away,

997
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:59,550
I was indignant that the victim
hadn't let me extract her last whimper,

998
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:01,770
without society hearing it.

999
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:08,767
The Countess of Santa Barbara
ran away just days ago, from her home.

1000
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:11,436
I presumed that she had gone to count
her lashes,

1001
01:34:11,437 --> 01:34:13,647
which nobody could imagine.

1002
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,901
I wanted to justify one disgrace with
another.

1003
01:34:17,277 --> 01:34:22,579
I accused her of adultery
In truth, if her honor is stained,

1004
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:25,409
it is due to my perversions,

1005
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:27,411
and the contact I forced her into
with a man

1006
01:34:27,412 --> 01:34:31,758
of degenerate instincts that dishonor
the name of my forefathers.

1007
01:34:34,544 --> 01:34:36,387
Mr. Alberto de Magalhaes!

1008
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:38,672
I told you the other day

1009
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:41,893
that your ethics have imposed your
duty to give an explanation.

1010
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:44,303
You told me.

1011
01:34:44,304 --> 01:34:48,275
I sent you two "seconds".
You refused the proposal of a duel.

1012
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,397
I refused.

1013
01:34:53,563 --> 01:34:56,940
Do I thus understand that,
in counterpoint,

1014
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:59,865
you propose
to make your amends?

1015
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,288
You misunderstood.

1016
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:09,796
In that case,
Mr. Alberto de Magalhaes,

1017
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:13,209
I must consider you a coward.

1018
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:23,343
You are a Coward!

1019
01:35:24,886 --> 01:35:27,095
You are a coward,
Mr. Alberto de Magalhaes!

1020
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:28,769
You are a Coward!

1021
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:31,943
Mr. Alberto de Magalhaes is a coward!

1022
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:34,479
You are a coward! Mr. Alberto de Magalhaes!

1023
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,604
Easy!

1024
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:37,105
- Easy! Easy!
- You are a coward!

1025
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:40,155
You are a coward! You are a coward,
Mr. Alberto de Magalhaes!

1026
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:17,439
What happened, sir?

1027
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:20,658
An uproar here between two nobles.

1028
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:25,496
One of them called the other a
coward and tried to shoot him.

1029
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:30,033
So, the other one grabbed him and sent
him through the air like a feather.

1030
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:31,627
But what a spectacle!

1031
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:34,288
And do you know what it was about?

1032
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:36,957
One of the nobles with him
had mentioned

1033
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:42,089
it was over some Countess or Vice
Countess of Santa Barbara.

1034
01:36:43,298 --> 01:36:45,924
Did you say the Countess
of Santa Barbara?

1035
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:47,973
Or Vice Countess,
I'm not precisely certain.

1036
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:52,222
Did you hear either of their names?
These fighting nobles?

1037
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:55,523
One of them talked of...
Alberto de Magalhaes.

1038
01:36:56,436 --> 01:37:00,063
And this one, Alberto,
headed toward the other one...

1039
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:03,409
I didn't hear what they were
talking about very well.

1040
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:05,045
The unknown man who courageously
took up my mother's defense,

1041
01:38:05,046 --> 01:38:08,220
was that mysterious correspondent
who called himself Alberto de Magalhaes.

1042
01:38:08,758 --> 01:38:11,056
He tried to deflect revelations about
the son

1043
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:13,559
who had been ripped from
her arms at birth.

1044
01:38:14,514 --> 01:38:17,643
And would become the most enigmatic
celebrity in Lisbon.

1045
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:21,522
And yet, Father Dinis was not one
to leave a puzzle unsolved.

1046
01:38:26,526 --> 01:38:29,528
What comes around goes around,
my dear. Do you see?

1047
01:38:29,529 --> 01:38:31,196
Disgrace has tired itself out.

1048
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:33,199
Thanks to you, Father Dinis.

1049
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:37,786
I could never repay you for what you did
for me and for my son. Never.

1050
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:40,540
No, my child. You owe me nothing.

1051
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:45,043
I did no more than repair
a tiny part

1052
01:38:45,044 --> 01:38:47,170
of the evil the world has done to you.

1053
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:48,547
And the Count?

1054
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:50,424
Now that he has had his penance,

1055
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:51,927
won't he want my mother
to return home?

1056
01:38:52,802 --> 01:38:54,928
No, no. Have no fear.

1057
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:58,432
The Count is in no position to demand
anything at all.

1058
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:01,061
He hardly dares beg you to forgive him.

1059
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:04,982
If he doesn't oblige me to return,
I will forgive him!

1060
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:07,609
I will forgive him with all my heart!

1061
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:11,162
Would you agree to make this
statement in Santarem?

1062
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:14,448
His condition is quite poor.

1063
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,950
He fears he may not be able
to return to Lisbon.

1064
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,578
And he despairs at the thought of dying

1065
01:39:19,579 --> 01:39:22,298
without hearing from your lips
that you forgive him.

1066
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:25,709
No, mother, don't agree! Don't go!

1067
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,586
I must agree my son.

1068
01:39:27,587 --> 01:39:29,760
Otherwise, I'll regret it my whole life.

1069
01:39:30,214 --> 01:39:31,682
Won't you follow me there?

1070
01:39:32,008 --> 01:39:33,260
That's perfectly understood.

1071
01:39:33,261 --> 01:39:34,593
When?

1072
01:39:34,594 --> 01:39:36,517
Tomorrow at dawn.

1073
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:56,957
I wanted to ask you, Countess:

1074
01:39:58,117 --> 01:39:59,618
Alberto de Magalhaes,

1075
01:39:59,619 --> 01:40:01,246
does that name mean anything to you?

1076
01:40:01,247 --> 01:40:03,464
Yes, I saw it in writing once.

1077
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:05,123
Where?

1078
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:08,924
On a note a gentleman gave Bernardo to
deliver to me.

1079
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:13,224
What did this note say,
if I am not being too indiscreet?

1080
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:18,684
Something about the secret
of my son's birth...

1081
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:22,891
I confess, I attached no importance
to it at the time.

1082
01:40:22,892 --> 01:40:26,738
I thought it was one more of the Count's
intrigues to torment me.

1083
01:40:28,564 --> 01:40:31,989
I threw it in a trunk and never
thought of it again.

1084
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:34,662
But the name on the signature, yes...

1085
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:39,535
Yes. It was Alberto de Magalhaes...

1086
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:42,036
Why do you ask, Father Dinis?

1087
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:46,081
Because I was told yesterday
that a man with that name

1088
01:40:46,082 --> 01:40:48,416
fought another man, on your behalf.

1089
01:40:48,417 --> 01:40:51,296
On my behalf? About what?

1090
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:55,298
I don't know, Countess.
But we must find out.

1091
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:58,348
You must show me that note
when we return to Lisbon.

1092
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:24,167
Countess, allow me to introduce you
to the Circuit Judge.

1093
01:41:25,705 --> 01:41:30,208
I know it is late, Countess,
but if Your Excellency desires

1094
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:34,504
I can call witnesses to proceed with the
opening of the will...

1095
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:37,975
No, Your Honor, please spare me.

1096
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:43,520
I understand. As you wish.
I am at your disposal.

1097
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:13,135
I am Friar Baltasar da Encarnaçao.

1098
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:17,469
And I was here during
the Count's final moments

1099
01:42:18,007 --> 01:42:20,931
I have a letter to deliver to the
Countess.

1100
01:42:23,262 --> 01:42:24,935
Countess.

1101
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:33,772
Friar Baltasar da Encarnagao,

1102
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:36,492
he spent the final moments
with the Count.

1103
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:41,072
If you'll allow me to explain,
Your Excellency...

1104
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:44,283
I promised your husband

1105
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:48,083
that I would personally deliver
this letter to you.

1106
01:42:49,038 --> 01:42:51,757
He dictated it to me with his last
breath,

1107
01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:56,136
and he signed it himself with his last
bit of strength.

1108
01:43:41,716 --> 01:43:44,592
My heart tells me
you will come too late.

1109
01:43:44,593 --> 01:43:49,190
And when you come, if you come,
my body will already be cold,

1110
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:51,599
my eyes will already be closed,

1111
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:54,524
and my ears will already be deaf
to the forgiveness from your lips.

1112
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:57,573
Don't curse me, Angela.

1113
01:43:58,357 --> 01:44:01,486
A man who promises me
your forgiveness is by my side.

1114
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:05,832
And a just man who will tell you to
forgive me is by your side.

1115
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:07,958
Listen to both of them!

1116
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:14,170
Save me and may the world curse the
memory of the Count of Santa Barbara.

1117
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:18,044
I die with your Visage etched
upon my heart.

1118
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:49,704
I was right to have
objected to their journey.

1119
01:44:50,326 --> 01:44:53,250
When my mother returned,
she was someone else.

1120
01:45:01,462 --> 01:45:05,012
What is going on?
Why won't she speak to me?

1121
01:45:06,926 --> 01:45:08,803
The Count is dead, my son.

1122
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:11,971
Your mother has been greatly affected.

1123
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,269
She hardly slept.

1124
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:17,312
Come. I have serious things to tell you.

1125
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:23,985
What I am about to tell you will
probably make you suffer.

1126
01:45:25,694 --> 01:45:27,492
But think of your mother.

1127
01:45:28,447 --> 01:45:32,793
You can be certain that her suffering
is infinitely greater than yours.

1128
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:34,920
Think of her.

1129
01:45:37,873 --> 01:45:41,594
The Count of Santa Barbara
made your mother his sole heir.

1130
01:45:41,961 --> 01:45:43,929
She has refused the inheritance.

1131
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:47,757
She thinks she has no right
to the fortune

1132
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:50,887
of the man she never considered
nor accepted as her husband.

1133
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:52,513
She did the right thing!

1134
01:45:52,972 --> 01:45:55,598
This inheritance would be
dishonorable.

1135
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:57,475
That is what she thinks, as well.

1136
01:45:57,476 --> 01:46:00,395
Simply put, her refusal now leaves her
without the means

1137
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:02,444
to live according
to her accustomed status.

1138
01:46:02,857 --> 01:46:05,233
As your grandfather,
the Marquis of Montezelos,

1139
01:46:05,234 --> 01:46:07,908
had said to your father,
your mother is poor.

1140
01:46:08,237 --> 01:46:10,738
A lady of her background,
with no fortune

1141
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:14,789
and without a husband, has no place in
the world she knows.

1142
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:18,213
But, alas, she has me. She has a son!

1143
01:46:18,998 --> 01:46:22,127
A year or two from now
I will be able to End a...

1144
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:25,628
I don't know, a mentor!

1145
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:28,098
I could be a mentor! I could teach...

1146
01:46:29,008 --> 01:46:32,638
A year or two from now, maybe...

1147
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:36,898
Three or four, more likely.

1148
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:40,059
But in the meantime, you must admit
you are more of a burden for your

1149
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,686
mother than anything else.

1150
01:46:41,687 --> 01:46:42,779
And so?

1151
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:48,285
So your mother has decided to enter
a convent.

1152
01:46:49,028 --> 01:46:49,779
No!

1153
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:51,872
It's the only reasonable solution.

1154
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:55,283
And, beyond that, it corresponds with your
mother's wish

1155
01:46:55,284 --> 01:46:58,036
to retire from the world that has made
her suffer so much,

1156
01:46:58,037 --> 01:47:00,788
and to respect the memory of the Count
of Santa Barbara...

1157
01:47:00,789 --> 01:47:01,756
What about me?

1158
01:47:05,169 --> 01:47:08,469
I just found my mother,
only to lose her again?

1159
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:12,222
I know it's not fair, my son.

1160
01:47:12,927 --> 01:47:14,929
But I can only repeat what I said
a little while ago.

1161
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:16,226
Think of her.

1162
01:47:16,972 --> 01:47:18,473
Think of her spirit,

1163
01:47:18,474 --> 01:47:21,353
after all these torments
that she has been through.

1164
01:47:22,978 --> 01:47:24,651
Think of your mother.

1165
01:47:58,722 --> 01:48:00,019
Goodbye, my lady.

1166
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:02,727
God be with you.

1167
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:05,897
Good luck.

1168
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,614
Pedro... Pedro!

1169
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:13,297
Come on.

1170
01:49:14,923 --> 01:49:17,972
Our men there boarded three
Spanish ships.

1171
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:22,227
Silks and porcelain.
There was no resistance at all.

1172
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:26,606
I've calculated our take at one hundred
and twenty thousand!

1173
01:49:27,436 --> 01:49:29,154
Silk has become scarce.

1174
01:49:31,065 --> 01:49:32,565
And in the Baltic?

1175
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:34,318
No news. It's early.

1176
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:36,194
What about Panama?

1177
01:49:36,195 --> 01:49:38,196
One boarding, but of no real interest.

1178
01:49:38,197 --> 01:49:40,541
The business in Peru is almost
finished.

1179
01:49:42,076 --> 01:49:43,703
Go on. You can come in.

1180
01:49:47,706 --> 01:49:50,960
The priest is here to see you,
Your Excellency.

1181
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:55,590
I always thought you would end up
entering a religious order!

1182
01:49:56,465 --> 01:49:58,308
Have him come into the salon.

1183
01:49:59,635 --> 01:50:01,010
You'll wait for me here?

1184
01:50:01,011 --> 01:50:02,602
It is pointless. I had already finished.

1185
01:50:02,603 --> 01:50:04,519
They are waiting for me at the guild.

1186
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:07,018
Leave through the garden.
You never know...

1187
01:50:42,136 --> 01:50:45,766
Is it with Mr. Alberto de Magalhaes
that I have this honor?

1188
01:50:47,516 --> 01:50:49,109
Don't you recognize me?

1189
01:50:50,644 --> 01:50:51,770
Should I?

1190
01:50:53,522 --> 01:50:55,069
Well, I recognize you.

1191
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:01,788
It seems like yesterday...

1192
01:51:03,407 --> 01:51:06,877
Even after all these years
and with that cassock...

1193
01:51:10,289 --> 01:51:11,882
By the way,

1194
01:51:13,709 --> 01:51:15,882
is the cassock real?

1195
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,593
Or is it more of a disguise?

1196
01:51:19,798 --> 01:51:21,550
I'm sorry, I don't understand
your intended irony.

1197
01:51:21,551 --> 01:51:23,177
Of what disguise do you speak?

1198
01:51:25,804 --> 01:51:27,226
The disguise of a gypsy.

1199
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,693
His name was Sabine Cabra...

1200
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:33,483
How do you know?

1201
01:51:33,484 --> 01:51:34,900
Where did you hear it?

1202
01:51:35,314 --> 01:51:36,734
Only two men knew that name.

1203
01:51:36,735 --> 01:51:38,200
One died, and the other...

1204
01:51:38,201 --> 01:51:41,412
The other called himself Knife-Eater!

1205
01:51:47,826 --> 01:51:50,796
Have I changed that much,
Mr. Sabine Cabra?

1206
01:51:56,084 --> 01:51:57,882
The cat is to be placed there!

1207
01:52:01,215 --> 01:52:02,637
Come on, quickly!

1208
01:52:05,844 --> 01:52:09,064
I want this done quickly!
Now leave!

1209
01:52:14,394 --> 01:52:15,737
I'm sorry.

1210
01:52:19,233 --> 01:52:21,235
The money you gave me
changed my life.

1211
01:52:23,987 --> 01:52:25,705
It freed my spirit.

1212
01:52:27,241 --> 01:52:29,335
It opened me up to knowledge.

1213
01:52:31,995 --> 01:52:34,373
The path of knowledge, of science.

1214
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,298
Of free will!

1215
01:52:47,886 --> 01:52:50,981
This pot is going on that side!
Come on, quickly!

1216
01:52:54,017 --> 01:52:57,897
I want everyone working!
Come on! Such incompetence!

1217
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:08,282
I'm sorry.

1218
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:12,832
But that's enough of my speech.

1219
01:53:14,705 --> 01:53:16,914
I'm not going to tell you how
Knife-Eater

1220
01:53:16,915 --> 01:53:19,259
transformed himself into Alberto de
Magalhaes.

1221
01:53:20,294 --> 01:53:22,388
It would be long and tedious.

1222
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:29,179
But I am also not going to ask how a
gypsy transformed himself into a priest.

1223
01:53:34,975 --> 01:53:36,475
But I am somewhat curious as to

1224
01:53:36,476 --> 01:53:38,945
whether the son of Angela de Lima
is alive.

1225
01:53:39,354 --> 01:53:41,527
He is. Thanks to God, he is.

1226
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:44,318
Relieved to hear it.

1227
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:48,322
Sincerely relieved.

1228
01:53:49,323 --> 01:53:50,916
I would like to see him.

1229
01:53:51,575 --> 01:53:52,747
You may.

1230
01:53:55,329 --> 01:53:57,673
But preferably without being seen.

1231
01:53:58,957 --> 01:54:01,208
I don't wish to explain the
circumstances

1232
01:54:01,209 --> 01:54:03,336
under which I saw him for the last time.

1233
01:54:03,337 --> 01:54:04,429
I understand.

1234
01:54:06,214 --> 01:54:07,261
You know...

1235
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,474
at times I think I actually did
what I had intended to do.

1236
01:54:16,475 --> 01:54:18,523
It gives me the cold sweats.

1237
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:24,106
I will never be able to repay you,
Father.

1238
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:26,485
I am already paid in full,
Mr. Alberto de Magalhaes.

1239
01:54:26,486 --> 01:54:28,861
We settled all our accounts today.

1240
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:30,990
Accounts, yes, accounts!

1241
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:35,502
I would like to entrust you with the sum
that had saved the boy's life.

1242
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:38,662
So that you can use to his benefit.

1243
01:54:38,663 --> 01:54:42,918
It was once the price of his blood.
It is only fair that he gets it back.

1244
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:50,179
Careful with the Bust!

1245
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:51,848
Let's get going, hurry up!

1246
01:54:52,803 --> 01:54:54,931
I want the candlesticks on that side!

1247
01:54:55,889 --> 01:54:58,017
I want everyone working!

1248
01:55:01,144 --> 01:55:02,487
Today!

1249
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:15,079
This mission pleases me,
and I accept.

1250
01:55:34,094 --> 01:55:35,812
What are you doing here?

1251
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:37,976
Get outside!

1252
01:55:39,558 --> 01:55:40,775
And quickly!

1253
01:56:02,456 --> 01:56:04,174
Gentlemen,

1254
01:56:07,627 --> 01:56:09,004
we're done for today.

1255
01:56:09,713 --> 01:56:11,010
Thank you very much.

1256
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:13,637
Thank you...

1257
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:21,724
Oh, I almost forgot! All of your
husband's wishes were fulfilled.

1258
01:56:21,725 --> 01:56:25,195
With the exception of the sum left to
Eugenia, his maid.

1259
01:56:26,104 --> 01:56:27,151
Why?

1260
01:56:27,731 --> 01:56:29,273
She didn't want to accept it.

1261
01:56:29,274 --> 01:56:31,697
She told me she hadn't sold herself
to the Count of Santa Barbara

1262
01:56:31,985 --> 01:56:34,454
while he was alive, let alone sold herself
to him after his death.

1263
01:56:39,868 --> 01:56:41,415
I didn't expect that of her.

1264
01:56:44,498 --> 01:56:46,375
Could I have been mistaken about her?

1265
01:56:54,758 --> 01:56:57,551
Days later, I met her in a carriage.

1266
01:56:57,552 --> 01:57:00,262
She stopped the horses,
called me to the window,

1267
01:57:00,263 --> 01:57:03,057
and gave me her address
in Praça da Alegria.

1268
01:57:03,058 --> 01:57:05,106
He invited me to visit him.

1269
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:06,986
And you're going?

1270
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:08,771
One of these days.

1271
01:57:08,772 --> 01:57:10,740
The mystery is provocative...

1272
01:57:18,657 --> 01:57:20,908
Oh, another thing:
Tomorrow I can't come.

1273
01:57:20,909 --> 01:57:22,627
I'm leaving for Santarem.

1274
01:57:23,411 --> 01:57:25,584
Does it still have to do with the death
of the Count?

1275
01:57:26,414 --> 01:57:30,135
Indirectly. The count's Confessor,
remember, the monk?

1276
01:57:30,418 --> 01:57:33,718
He asked me to visit him.

1277
01:57:34,047 --> 01:57:36,141
Will you please tell my sister?

1278
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:40,642
Your sister? Dona Antonia?

1279
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:46,435
As far as I know,

1280
01:57:48,937 --> 01:57:51,281
Sebastiao de Melo had no sisters...

1281
01:57:53,108 --> 01:57:55,110
Didn't he?

1282
01:57:57,612 --> 01:57:58,955
Another secret?

1283
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:02,792
You'll get your answer later.

1284
01:58:08,707 --> 01:58:11,836
I beg you to continue to consider
her as my sister.

1285
01:58:13,378 --> 01:58:14,595
You'll tell her?

1286
01:58:15,839 --> 01:58:17,341
Rest assured.

1287
01:58:19,634 --> 01:58:26,188
End of part one.

1288
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:36,910
Second part.

1289
01:58:38,403 --> 01:58:39,780
Father. Father!

1290
01:58:40,655 --> 01:58:44,705
If you only knew how anxiously and
impatiently I've been waiting for you!

1291
01:58:47,329 --> 01:58:50,959
I was uncertain about
writing to the Countess...

1292
01:58:51,541 --> 01:58:53,043
With what intention?

1293
01:58:54,169 --> 01:58:56,888
With the intention of spending
a few hours

1294
01:58:57,297 --> 01:58:59,720
to help an old monk.

1295
01:59:02,969 --> 01:59:08,223
But I've gone on and on and you
must be dying of hunger and thirst

1296
01:59:08,224 --> 01:59:10,898
after such a journey, Father!

1297
01:59:11,186 --> 01:59:13,530
Come. Come.

1298
01:59:17,442 --> 01:59:22,323
The monk in charge has left
us the pick of his chicken coop.

1299
01:59:23,615 --> 01:59:24,832
As a special treat!

1300
01:59:26,201 --> 01:59:28,545
The capon is divine, you'll see...

1301
01:59:29,621 --> 01:59:33,251
Baked, with baby potatoes.

1302
01:59:35,335 --> 01:59:37,212
And the monastery wine?

1303
01:59:37,837 --> 01:59:39,589
Renowned! You'll see.

1304
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:43,217
I'm not that much of an eater and
drinker.

1305
01:59:43,218 --> 01:59:47,940
I was. But I'm afraid I've lost the
habit and the taste.

1306
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:50,771
Bad! That's bad.

1307
01:59:52,102 --> 01:59:53,977
They're the blessings of the Lord

1308
01:59:53,978 --> 01:59:55,696
it's our duty to honor them.

1309
01:59:56,606 --> 02:00:02,659
We, more than anyone else,
as His true servants...

1310
02:00:07,033 --> 02:00:09,502
But in the present case,

1311
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:13,248
I must confess that
my references to the menu

1312
02:00:15,375 --> 02:00:16,752
are a secondary issue.

1313
02:00:18,545 --> 02:00:19,888
What do you mean?

1314
02:00:22,924 --> 02:00:25,177
I have a long story to tell you.

1315
02:00:26,511 --> 02:00:27,683
My story.

1316
02:00:29,764 --> 02:00:31,687
I've never told it to anyone.

1317
02:00:34,144 --> 02:00:38,564
During my long tale
you will surely ask yourself

1318
02:00:38,565 --> 02:00:40,738
why I am telling you these things.

1319
02:00:47,449 --> 02:00:50,168
You will understand,
once and for all, why.

1320
02:00:52,203 --> 02:00:54,831
Accept that I'll keep you quiet for now.

1321
02:00:59,711 --> 02:01:01,304
I was born in Minho.

1322
02:01:01,921 --> 02:01:06,347
My father was from a noble family,
older than the kings of this land...

1323
02:01:07,177 --> 02:01:10,556
I was born with bad instincts
and was freely educated.

1324
02:01:11,806 --> 02:01:15,184
They issued me carte blanche
to freely dispose of the gold

1325
02:01:15,185 --> 02:01:18,439
with which I prodigiously
indulged my immoralities.

1326
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:23,409
All of this ended

1327
02:01:23,818 --> 02:01:26,913
when I saw the
Countess of Viso for the first time.

1328
02:01:28,573 --> 02:01:32,201
It was my cousin, Paulo,
my best and most loyal friend,

1329
02:01:32,202 --> 02:01:33,670
almost like a brother,

1330
02:01:34,078 --> 02:01:36,955
who took me one night
to a gala held by the Count,

1331
02:01:36,956 --> 02:01:38,299
her husband...

1332
02:02:09,489 --> 02:02:12,115
The baroness would have bitten
you if she could have...

1333
02:02:12,116 --> 02:02:13,743
What did you do to her?

1334
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:15,878
I couldn't take it any longer.

1335
02:02:16,371 --> 02:02:17,871
I broke it off with her.

1336
02:02:17,872 --> 02:02:19,374
She wouldn't give in.

1337
02:02:19,749 --> 02:02:24,255
Tears, screams, howls.
Unbearable.

1338
02:02:26,756 --> 02:02:28,758
I wrote to her husband.

1339
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:33,809
You wrote to him!? Saying what?

1340
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:37,516
That I had been his wife's lover.

1341
02:02:37,517 --> 02:02:38,313
And the lie:

1342
02:02:40,186 --> 02:02:42,530
That I had broken it off because I
found it hard to deceive him.

1343
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:44,690
You wrote that to him?!

1344
02:02:44,691 --> 02:02:45,774
Literally.

1345
02:02:45,775 --> 02:02:49,194
And I stressed that the woman
would not let me go,

1346
02:02:49,195 --> 02:02:51,698
and that it was now up to him,
the husband, to take her in hand.

1347
02:02:53,032 --> 02:02:55,450
No! What did he do?

1348
02:02:55,451 --> 02:02:58,705
I don't know, but she left me in peace.

1349
02:03:02,417 --> 02:03:05,717
Alvaro, you are truly unique!

1350
02:03:08,548 --> 02:03:10,391
No, Paulo, I'm not.

1351
02:03:15,597 --> 02:03:17,315
I'm bored with myself.

1352
02:03:18,474 --> 02:03:21,318
Bored, but why?

1353
02:03:22,103 --> 02:03:25,403
I'm twenty-three years old, Paulo.
Twenty-three!

1354
02:03:27,442 --> 02:03:32,790
And in twenty-three years I've never
known the thrill of a noble passion.

1355
02:03:37,327 --> 02:03:38,795
Noble passion!

1356
02:03:39,704 --> 02:03:42,080
That doesn't even sound like you,
cousin.

1357
02:03:42,081 --> 02:03:43,207
With all the women that you...

1358
02:03:43,208 --> 02:03:45,500
With all the women I've thrown into
dishonor.

1359
02:03:45,501 --> 02:03:47,845
No, that you threw or they threw
themselves.

1360
02:03:48,463 --> 02:03:50,966
Don't tell me you're feeling remorse.
Is that it?

1361
02:03:51,591 --> 02:03:52,966
No, it's not that...

1362
02:03:52,967 --> 02:03:56,136
Not one of them
weighs on my conscience.

1363
02:03:56,137 --> 02:04:02,270
What weighs on me is that not one of
them inspired true affection in me.

1364
02:04:53,027 --> 02:04:55,904
Be careful, the Count is a jealous man...

1365
02:04:55,905 --> 02:04:57,373
And a man of arms!

1366
02:04:57,824 --> 02:05:00,953
And the Countess has everything
that can cause a man to lose himself.

1367
02:05:02,412 --> 02:05:06,133
Yes, an almost pilgrim-like beauty,
and they say she has a rich spirit.

1368
02:05:08,918 --> 02:05:12,170
For the love of such a woman,
I could become my friend's assassin...

1369
02:05:12,171 --> 02:05:14,640
If the condition of my power were such.

1370
02:05:17,218 --> 02:05:18,470
What a look!

1371
02:05:19,303 --> 02:05:23,149
A look that says: retreat,
you wretched man!

1372
02:05:25,184 --> 02:05:28,311
It's not just the Countess who is
looking at you...

1373
02:05:28,312 --> 02:05:30,313
Didn't I tell you he was jealous?

1374
02:05:30,314 --> 02:05:31,486
Count.

1375
02:05:33,735 --> 02:05:37,195
They tell me that we share feelings
for the same person,

1376
02:05:37,196 --> 02:05:38,823
Don Alvaro de Albuquerque.

1377
02:05:41,701 --> 02:05:44,995
It isn't always appropriate
to put faith in what people say, Count.

1378
02:05:44,996 --> 02:05:46,122
How so?

1379
02:05:46,998 --> 02:05:49,332
Was it not your father who died

1380
02:05:49,333 --> 02:05:52,836
in the dungeons of the Castle of S. Joao
da Foz, near here?

1381
02:05:52,837 --> 02:05:55,839
Just some ten years ago?

1382
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,842
It was eleven, Count. Eleven years ago.

1383
02:05:58,843 --> 02:06:00,140
Eleven years ago.

1384
02:06:00,636 --> 02:06:02,730
So they hadn't misinformed me then.

1385
02:06:03,014 --> 02:06:04,389
Not by the look of things.

1386
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:05,607
If you'll excuse me...

1387
02:06:05,608 --> 02:06:08,399
But, in fact, I'm sorry, Count.

1388
02:06:09,896 --> 02:06:12,991
To whom does this sentiment that
we share refer?

1389
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:17,905
- Did you perchance know my father?
- No. Unfortunately.

1390
02:06:18,905 --> 02:06:20,532
I did not have that honor.

1391
02:06:21,741 --> 02:06:24,790
I was referring to the man responsible
for his death.

1392
02:06:27,622 --> 02:06:29,340
The Count of Oeiras?

1393
02:06:30,666 --> 02:06:35,968
Was it not the torture of this
butcher of a man

1394
02:06:37,507 --> 02:06:39,509
that led to you losing your father?

1395
02:06:42,637 --> 02:06:49,771
It was also thanks to his intrigues
with His Majesty

1396
02:06:50,895 --> 02:06:52,238
that I was removed from
the Palace.

1397
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:56,283
I shall never forgive him.

1398
02:06:56,651 --> 02:06:58,779
Nor shall I, believe me.

1399
02:07:00,947 --> 02:07:03,573
I've waited eleven years
for this happy moment

1400
02:07:03,574 --> 02:07:05,702
where I can alleviate my rancor
with the spilled blood

1401
02:07:05,703 --> 02:07:07,327
of the Marquis of Pombal.

1402
02:07:07,328 --> 02:07:11,083
Holy words, my friend, Holy words!

1403
02:07:17,797 --> 02:07:20,715
Friends throughout life
and throughout death!

1404
02:07:20,716 --> 02:07:22,218
This house is yours.

1405
02:07:23,219 --> 02:07:27,019
I will take full pleasure in keeping my
door open to you,

1406
02:07:27,849 --> 02:07:30,944
both by day and by night!

1407
02:07:34,939 --> 02:07:36,691
Music, Music.

1408
02:07:37,066 --> 02:07:41,319
The friendship of the Count in no way
altered the iciness of the Countess.

1409
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:49,125
Her indifference, silent and impassable,
was like a sarcastic jab at my vanity...

1410
02:07:50,746 --> 02:07:52,498
She was my first passion,

1411
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:57,177
and I fed it with generous tears.

1412
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:00,632
Alvaro...

1413
02:08:03,634 --> 02:08:05,636
That was my name back then,

1414
02:08:07,722 --> 02:08:10,140
but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

1415
02:08:10,141 --> 02:08:13,145
I will tell you everything at the
appropriate time.

1416
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:18,775
Until that evening I had never met the
Countess face to face.

1417
02:08:35,374 --> 02:08:38,376
What happened?
Who is going to travel?

1418
02:08:38,377 --> 02:08:41,472
The Count, sir. His Majesty died
yesterday

1419
02:08:44,050 --> 02:08:45,677
Don Alvaro.

1420
02:08:47,511 --> 02:08:49,639
I was going to send someone
to advise you.

1421
02:08:50,681 --> 02:08:54,777
We are going to have to move our
little game.

1422
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:57,738
Don José is dead.

1423
02:08:59,148 --> 02:09:03,568
Her Highness, Dona Maria
called me to the Palace

1424
02:09:03,569 --> 02:09:08,416
to attend the tribute and has named me
a Knight of the Royal Chamber!

1425
02:09:08,783 --> 02:09:10,911
Good, which means that the
Marquis...

1426
02:09:11,786 --> 02:09:13,709
now has his days numbered.

1427
02:09:16,916 --> 02:09:21,012
Her Highness loathes him more
than the two of us together, man!

1428
02:09:22,296 --> 02:09:24,839
Where are you going in such a hurry?

1429
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:27,307
I'm going to get a Port wine I've had
in the house for fifteen years,

1430
02:09:27,308 --> 02:09:28,598
that's been waiting
for this very occasion!

1431
02:09:28,599 --> 02:09:31,179
There is plenty of time for that, man.

1432
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:33,854
First, I wanted to ask you a favor.
From one friend to another...

1433
02:09:35,184 --> 02:09:37,185
Tell me, only if I'm unable to...

1434
02:09:37,186 --> 02:09:38,859
You're able. Just willing to is enough.

1435
02:09:38,860 --> 02:09:42,691
I would like you to give two words of
consolation to the Countess...

1436
02:09:42,692 --> 02:09:44,535
But isn't the Countess going with you?

1437
02:09:44,819 --> 02:09:46,662
What a thought, Don Alvaro!

1438
02:09:46,988 --> 02:09:51,744
You know that women, in these political
matters, are an obstacle.

1439
02:09:53,369 --> 02:10:00,002
The Countess sat down, and she was
offended. Well, you know...

1440
02:10:01,752 --> 02:10:04,504
Who better than my friend to explain it
to her?

1441
02:10:04,505 --> 02:10:07,090
It's just that I don't have the time.
Nor the talent.

1442
02:10:07,091 --> 02:10:08,591
I am a man of arms, not words,

1443
02:10:08,592 --> 02:10:10,890
I have no knack whatsoever
for speeches.

1444
02:10:11,262 --> 02:10:13,972
Well, but will the Countess listen to me?

1445
02:10:13,973 --> 02:10:16,601
She hears just fine
so why wouldn't she listen?

1446
02:10:17,393 --> 02:10:20,693
Women melt with beautiful words.

1447
02:10:22,982 --> 02:10:24,325
Thank you, my friend.

1448
02:10:24,734 --> 02:10:27,652
And don't let the Countess
embarrass herself any further.

1449
02:10:27,653 --> 02:10:30,122
Strike the iron while it's hot.

1450
02:10:33,617 --> 02:10:37,212
I'm dying to see the face of the Marquis

1451
02:10:38,539 --> 02:10:43,170
being run out of the Palace with a
swift foot to the seat of his pants!

1452
02:10:59,268 --> 02:11:00,770
Well they're wrong!

1453
02:11:01,896 --> 02:11:05,526
The Count is wrong,
and so is his lawyer.

1454
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:12,532
It's not about vanity.

1455
02:11:12,823 --> 02:11:14,996
Nor about wounded self-esteem.

1456
02:11:15,576 --> 02:11:18,420
What hurts me is
the lack of consideration.

1457
02:11:19,163 --> 02:11:20,915
It's being treated like a...

1458
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:24,927
like a ridiculous obstacle.

1459
02:11:28,798 --> 02:11:31,392
I'm delighted you find me amusing,
Don Alvaro.

1460
02:11:32,968 --> 02:11:35,687
Especially when I'm not trying to be
funny.

1461
02:11:36,347 --> 02:11:38,932
I am afraid you have
mistaken me, Countess.

1462
02:11:38,933 --> 02:11:40,560
I am not the Count's lawyer,

1463
02:11:40,935 --> 02:11:43,688
nor does my smile carry the intention
you have attributed it.

1464
02:11:43,979 --> 02:11:46,903
It was the word "obstacle" that
made me smile.

1465
02:11:47,191 --> 02:11:49,694
It was the same word the Count
used just now.

1466
02:11:53,072 --> 02:11:55,073
He referred to me as an obstacle?

1467
02:11:55,074 --> 02:11:56,451
No, not personally.

1468
02:11:56,742 --> 02:11:58,451
He spoke of women in general.

1469
02:11:58,452 --> 02:12:01,922
You know the Count carries his heart in
his mouth. He is a soldier.

1470
02:12:02,331 --> 02:12:06,677
He has the rude frankness of a soldier.
He has no style. No pretense.

1471
02:12:07,211 --> 02:12:08,463
Is that the case?

1472
02:12:11,632 --> 02:12:14,101
But the truth is, either
in general or in particular,

1473
02:12:14,102 --> 02:12:16,972
you think my role is not by his side in
the Palace,

1474
02:12:17,263 --> 02:12:19,857
but here as your servant in this place
of exile!

1475
02:12:25,855 --> 02:12:27,778
You certainly think like he does.

1476
02:12:28,107 --> 02:12:29,700
No. Not in any way.

1477
02:12:30,651 --> 02:12:32,986
I don't think your place is here.

1478
02:12:32,987 --> 02:12:34,580
And even less as a servant.

1479
02:12:37,032 --> 02:12:38,079
Why?

1480
02:12:40,661 --> 02:12:42,083
You hardly know me.

1481
02:12:42,621 --> 02:12:45,716
I know you well enough, Silvina,

1482
02:12:48,043 --> 02:12:50,592
To guess, to see beyond appearances,

1483
02:12:51,005 --> 02:12:53,474
all your desires and anxieties.

1484
02:12:54,049 --> 02:12:55,925
The Countess could tell...

1485
02:12:55,926 --> 02:12:57,178
stifled dreams...

1486
02:12:57,179 --> 02:12:59,556
She knew only too well...
that I adored her.

1487
02:13:00,139 --> 02:13:04,235
She would fight against her heart,
denying its impulses...

1488
02:13:05,019 --> 02:13:06,271
But she was weak.

1489
02:13:06,272 --> 02:13:08,021
Am I really so transparent?

1490
02:13:08,022 --> 02:13:11,526
As weak as every woman
who fights two powerful enemies:

1491
02:13:12,193 --> 02:13:14,287
The indifference of her husband...

1492
02:13:15,029 --> 02:13:17,407
and the most loving warmth of desire.

1493
02:13:19,283 --> 02:13:20,785
She gave in to it.

1494
02:13:22,578 --> 02:13:28,458
They all give in in the end, Father
Dinis, when the lover's patience takes

1495
02:13:28,459 --> 02:13:31,554
advantage of the husband's impatience.

1496
02:13:58,948 --> 02:14:01,997
God in heaven! It's daytime!

1497
02:14:04,203 --> 02:14:06,547
Alvaro! Alvaro!

1498
02:14:07,248 --> 02:14:09,876
For the love of God, wake up!
It's already daytime!

1499
02:14:13,629 --> 02:14:17,099
Alvaro! Alvaro!

1500
02:14:25,599 --> 02:14:27,021
Such a shame.

1501
02:14:27,351 --> 02:14:29,228
You're going to have to hide me here
until night time.

1502
02:14:29,229 --> 02:14:30,770
That's impossible!

1503
02:14:30,771 --> 02:14:32,614
They're bound to want to clean up...

1504
02:14:37,361 --> 02:14:39,489
Oh my God! Someone is coming!

1505
02:14:46,745 --> 02:14:48,246
Yes, what is it?

1506
02:14:48,247 --> 02:14:51,342
Forgive me, Countess, a letter has
arrived from the Count. It is urgent.

1507
02:14:53,544 --> 02:14:55,253
Do you not feel well, Countess?

1508
02:14:55,254 --> 02:15:00,351
No, I slept poorly.
Don't interrupt me again unless I call.

1509
02:15:13,397 --> 02:15:16,276
Alvaro! Please...please.

1510
02:15:28,412 --> 02:15:29,880
He wants you to go to him.

1511
02:15:30,205 --> 02:15:33,755
Right now. Today.
"Come at once".

1512
02:15:36,337 --> 02:15:37,837
Why this hurry?

1513
02:15:37,838 --> 02:15:39,172
He doesn't say...

1514
02:15:39,173 --> 02:15:43,519
But like this, suddenly,
after three months...

1515
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:46,805
He knows.

1516
02:15:50,309 --> 02:15:53,108
Impossible. We were so careful.

1517
02:15:56,565 --> 02:15:57,940
How could he know?

1518
02:15:57,941 --> 02:15:58,442
He knows.

1519
02:15:59,318 --> 02:16:01,662
Someone told him.
Someone must have seen us.

1520
02:16:18,128 --> 02:16:19,721
No, Alvaro, you're right.

1521
02:16:20,130 --> 02:16:21,848
I can't go to be with him...

1522
02:16:22,216 --> 02:16:25,259
Better to die. Better to kill myself!

1523
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:26,102
No!

1524
02:16:27,262 --> 02:16:28,434
Better to live!

1525
02:16:29,223 --> 02:16:36,857
The two of us. Far away from here.
In France or Italy. It doesn't matter.

1526
02:16:39,233 --> 02:16:41,076
But the two of us. Together.

1527
02:16:41,527 --> 02:16:42,744
Run away?!

1528
02:16:45,239 --> 02:16:47,082
With what? How?

1529
02:16:49,284 --> 02:16:50,251
When?

1530
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:53,168
I'll sell everything I own here.

1531
02:16:53,622 --> 02:16:55,420
Two days are all I need.

1532
02:16:56,417 --> 02:16:58,511
Two days from now we'll be in Spain.

1533
02:16:59,545 --> 02:17:01,673
Three days later, we can be in Venice.

1534
02:17:02,297 --> 02:17:04,766
But the two of us! Free!

1535
02:18:10,365 --> 02:18:13,744
We crossed half of Europe
as if in a dream.

1536
02:18:14,453 --> 02:18:19,459
To Spain, France, the north of Italy.

1537
02:18:20,125 --> 02:18:22,503
We only stopped in Venice.

1538
02:18:23,086 --> 02:18:26,340
We spent months of supreme
happiness there.

1539
02:18:28,217 --> 02:18:33,144
But in the shadows, and with no
signs as to excite curiosity in us,

1540
02:18:33,764 --> 02:18:35,266
we were without a country.

1541
02:18:35,641 --> 02:18:40,613
There wasn't a single hint that could give
away our identity as outsiders.

1542
02:18:40,896 --> 02:18:44,901
Until the day Silvina told me
she was carrying a child.

1543
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:51,867
Quite soon, however, the event that
should have crowned our happiness,

1544
02:18:52,908 --> 02:18:55,752
now threatened it's very existence.

1545
02:18:56,662 --> 02:18:57,995
How are you?

1546
02:18:57,996 --> 02:18:59,213
How is she?

1547
02:18:59,623 --> 02:19:01,341
How do you expect her to be?

1548
02:19:08,382 --> 02:19:09,679
I don't understand.

1549
02:19:10,133 --> 02:19:12,511
You knew the risk you were running...

1550
02:19:12,803 --> 02:19:16,103
Risk? What risk, doctor?

1551
02:19:19,017 --> 02:19:20,690
She didn't tell you?

1552
02:19:21,395 --> 02:19:24,194
What was she supposed
to have told me?

1553
02:19:25,774 --> 02:19:27,447
She didn't tell you.

1554
02:19:28,151 --> 02:19:30,903
The physiological constitution
of the lady...

1555
02:19:30,904 --> 02:19:33,657
The what? What does she have?
What constitution?

1556
02:19:34,157 --> 02:19:35,955
The doctors had advised her...

1557
02:19:37,327 --> 02:19:38,920
They said nothing to you?

1558
02:19:42,583 --> 02:19:48,966
When she married, they warned her:
Childbirth could be fatal for her...

1559
02:19:54,177 --> 02:19:55,394
Fatal!?

1560
02:20:01,935 --> 02:20:07,189
Don't despair. Science sometimes
works miracles.

1561
02:20:07,190 --> 02:20:09,284
Come with me, come see her.

1562
02:20:21,955 --> 02:20:25,710
Alvaro.

1563
02:20:28,754 --> 02:20:30,427
My God, I am going to die!

1564
02:20:33,091 --> 02:20:35,264
No. I won't leave Silvina!

1565
02:20:36,845 --> 02:20:38,438
Why didn't you tell me?

1566
02:20:39,473 --> 02:20:40,770
I didn't want to...

1567
02:20:43,894 --> 02:20:46,397
- You should have told me!
- I didn't want to frighten you...

1568
02:20:56,406 --> 02:21:00,456
I thought, with time the doctors might...

1569
02:21:18,136 --> 02:21:19,979
Come on, be strong!

1570
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:23,938
Now leave. Let us work.

1571
02:23:33,814 --> 02:23:34,531
Be strong!

1572
02:24:08,932 --> 02:24:12,186
I thought I would die,
but I did not die.

1573
02:24:14,312 --> 02:24:15,689
I considered suicide.

1574
02:24:16,982 --> 02:24:18,315
I looked around me,

1575
02:24:18,316 --> 02:24:22,071
searching for a
pistol, a dagger, an abyss...

1576
02:24:27,826 --> 02:24:32,252
Paradoxically, my religious beliefs were
born in that very instant.

1577
02:24:33,623 --> 02:24:36,718
Without God, there are incurable
wounds.

1578
02:24:37,711 --> 02:24:40,464
I had to convince myself
I was struggling with God

1579
02:24:40,881 --> 02:24:46,229
to retract the blasphemies in my heart
invented by my desperation.

1580
02:25:10,785 --> 02:25:13,746
I could not abandon Silvina's body
in Venice.

1581
02:25:13,747 --> 02:25:15,090
I took it with me.

1582
02:25:16,374 --> 02:25:21,253
My cousin Paulo had been put in
charge of Portugal's commerce in Rome.

1583
02:25:21,254 --> 02:25:22,972
He was my only hope.

1584
02:27:10,238 --> 02:27:11,410
Alvaro.

1585
02:27:20,415 --> 02:27:21,792
Such horrible news.

1586
02:27:25,879 --> 02:27:27,176
My poor friend.

1587
02:27:31,509 --> 02:27:32,726
Sit down.

1588
02:27:50,278 --> 02:27:52,121
Life, at times, is like that.

1589
02:27:53,031 --> 02:27:54,032
Cruel.

1590
02:27:55,325 --> 02:27:56,918
And quite unjust.

1591
02:27:59,913 --> 02:28:01,335
Cruel, without doubt.

1592
02:28:02,665 --> 02:28:05,384
Unjust, I don't know...

1593
02:28:06,836 --> 02:28:10,306
I speak for myself.
I suffer what I caused to suffer. I pay.

1594
02:28:12,801 --> 02:28:13,973
But her, my God!

1595
02:28:17,722 --> 02:28:19,019
She is paying for me!

1596
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:23,435
Because she certainly is not
paying for herself.

1597
02:28:23,436 --> 02:28:28,067
Enough. You can't continue to torment
yourself like this.

1598
02:28:29,067 --> 02:28:30,319
I'm sorry, Paulo.

1599
02:28:32,195 --> 02:28:34,118
It's you I'm tormenting now.

1600
02:28:36,449 --> 02:28:37,450
You're right.

1601
02:28:39,494 --> 02:28:40,962
Enough tears.

1602
02:28:47,460 --> 02:28:49,963
I've decided to retreat to a monastery.

1603
02:28:54,717 --> 02:28:55,934
You?

1604
02:28:58,221 --> 02:29:00,848
Not out of my love for religion!

1605
02:29:00,849 --> 02:29:03,016
Nor out of a thirst for humiliation.

1606
02:29:03,017 --> 02:29:06,191
Nor for the cilices, the fasting,
the discipline...

1607
02:29:10,608 --> 02:29:12,235
No. It's my way of leaving life,

1608
02:29:12,861 --> 02:29:16,613
without resorting to the cowardly
annihilation of my body.

1609
02:29:16,614 --> 02:29:18,366
To kill my body.

1610
02:29:18,867 --> 02:29:20,665
And to weather
the storms of the soul.

1611
02:29:20,666 --> 02:29:23,630
Yes but, after all, you have a son...

1612
02:29:24,497 --> 02:29:25,248
Exactly.

1613
02:29:26,916 --> 02:29:29,010
That is why I came to see you.

1614
02:29:31,504 --> 02:29:34,383
So that you can take responsibility
for his upbringing.

1615
02:29:37,552 --> 02:29:39,011
Me?!

1616
02:29:39,012 --> 02:29:40,104
Yes, you, Paulo.

1617
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:46,152
You're the only friend I have left.

1618
02:30:17,425 --> 02:30:18,051
Alvaro.

1619
02:31:32,250 --> 02:31:33,968
You left him in Rome?

1620
02:31:35,044 --> 02:31:36,762
I never saw him again.

1621
02:31:39,048 --> 02:31:40,300
For how long?

1622
02:31:41,884 --> 02:31:43,978
Fifty-four years.

1623
02:31:44,762 --> 02:31:46,638
It isn't possible!
Venice, Rome.

1624
02:31:46,639 --> 02:31:48,232
Fifty-four years!

1625
02:31:49,392 --> 02:31:52,271
My cousin Paulo died two years later.

1626
02:31:53,271 --> 02:31:55,524
He entrusted the child to a friend.

1627
02:31:56,816 --> 02:31:58,409
The Marquis of Luso.

1628
02:31:59,652 --> 02:32:02,656
Guillotined in France by the Jacobins.

1629
02:32:04,657 --> 02:32:06,751
I lost track of you there.

1630
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:11,130
I didn't care if you were alive,
or if you were dead.

1631
02:32:12,457 --> 02:32:18,180
I was picked up by Raymond
de Montfort, a retainer of Louis XVI.

1632
02:32:19,297 --> 02:32:22,642
He took me to Angouleme
and raised me like his own son.

1633
02:32:23,926 --> 02:32:29,979
What winding roads we had
to travel, my son, for us to meet again.

1634
02:32:33,227 --> 02:32:34,729
How did you know?

1635
02:32:37,065 --> 02:32:39,691
I recognized you as soon as I saw you
enter the antechamber

1636
02:32:39,692 --> 02:32:41,694
of the Count of Santa Barbara.

1637
02:32:44,322 --> 02:32:46,745
Why, I don't know. Don't ask me.

1638
02:32:48,826 --> 02:32:51,204
The way you carry yourself, perhaps.

1639
02:32:53,247 --> 02:32:54,248
Her look...

1640
02:32:56,834 --> 02:32:57,926
Silvina.

1641
02:32:59,754 --> 02:33:01,472
Your mother's look...

1642
02:33:05,259 --> 02:33:06,351
And her...

1643
02:33:07,261 --> 02:33:08,057
My mother?

1644
02:33:20,274 --> 02:33:24,120
Has accompanied me ever since.
At every meal.

1645
02:33:43,881 --> 02:33:45,554
I give it to you, my son.

1646
02:33:51,639 --> 02:33:53,312
My time has come...

1647
02:34:07,905 --> 02:34:11,409
There was a tightly sealed door
at Father Dinis's school,

1648
02:34:11,826 --> 02:34:14,124
and no one was allowed
to open it...

1649
02:35:17,350 --> 02:35:20,103
You know perfectly well
no one is allowed in here.

1650
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:22,113
Forgive me, Father Dinis,
I didn't know.

1651
02:35:22,114 --> 02:35:23,897
You knew! Keep quiet!

1652
02:35:23,898 --> 02:35:26,367
Save what you have to say for
confession!

1653
02:35:29,737 --> 02:35:32,707
But as long as you're here,
I'll explain it to you...

1654
02:35:38,621 --> 02:35:41,750
This was my uniform as
a soldier of the Emperor.

1655
02:35:47,505 --> 02:35:51,351
This was the hat worn by "worldly man".

1656
02:35:56,806 --> 02:35:58,558
The gypsy, Sabine Cabra.

1657
02:36:02,061 --> 02:36:03,233
And here,

1658
02:36:09,652 --> 02:36:11,029
my mother's skull.

1659
02:36:16,909 --> 02:36:17,956
Now you know.

1660
02:36:21,289 --> 02:36:22,336
And don't forget:

1661
02:36:26,711 --> 02:36:28,338
Solidarity with all men.

1662
02:36:31,048 --> 02:36:33,551
This is my temple to sincerity.

1663
02:36:37,346 --> 02:36:38,313
That is all.

1664
02:36:48,482 --> 02:36:51,076
Father Dinis! Father Dinis!

1665
02:37:03,623 --> 02:37:04,749
I'm sorry.

1666
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:22,191
And now, my friends, let's talk...

1667
02:38:42,346 --> 02:38:45,270
Father Dinis decided to send
me to France for my studies.

1668
02:38:45,599 --> 02:38:47,308
On the night before my departure,

1669
02:38:47,309 --> 02:38:49,687
I went to see my mother, through
the bars of the convent gate.

1670
02:38:52,690 --> 02:38:54,613
We both remained speechless.

1671
02:38:55,693 --> 02:38:59,487
We just kept looking at each
other for the entire visit,

1672
02:38:59,488 --> 02:39:01,573
as if we already knew it might
be the last time

1673
02:39:01,574 --> 02:39:03,121
we would ever see each other.

1674
02:39:54,627 --> 02:39:58,046
While I waited to board the ship
that would take me to France,

1675
02:39:58,047 --> 02:40:01,722
I noticed a man who couldn't
seem to take his eyes off me.

1676
02:40:02,635 --> 02:40:04,886
I could not have imagined
the decisive role

1677
02:40:04,887 --> 02:40:06,855
he had played in my past,

1678
02:40:07,181 --> 02:40:10,151
let alone what role he was
to play in my future.

1679
02:41:08,117 --> 02:41:11,578
In life, there are events and
coincidences of such extravagance

1680
02:41:11,579 --> 02:41:14,082
that no novelist would ever dare
to invent them...

1681
02:41:15,082 --> 02:41:18,835
It was one of those improbable events
that led Alberto de Magalhaes

1682
02:41:18,836 --> 02:41:23,012
to marry Eugenia, the former lover
of the Count of Santa Barbara...

1683
02:41:25,843 --> 02:41:27,220
Superb creature!

1684
02:41:28,095 --> 02:41:31,097
Careful, old man, her husband
is as jealous as a tiger.

1685
02:41:31,098 --> 02:41:32,725
And, as ferocious as two.

1686
02:41:33,392 --> 02:41:34,860
Speak of the devil...

1687
02:41:39,148 --> 02:41:40,365
But I know him.

1688
02:41:41,108 --> 02:41:43,026
Who? Alberto de Magalhaes?

1689
02:41:43,027 --> 02:41:45,280
That's what he calls himself
around here?

1690
02:41:45,654 --> 02:41:48,239
In Paris, his name
was Leopoldo Saavedra

1691
02:41:48,240 --> 02:41:50,783
and in Brussels, Tobias Navarro!

1692
02:41:50,784 --> 02:41:52,744
Are you serious? When?

1693
02:41:52,745 --> 02:41:54,713
About three or four years ago.

1694
02:41:54,997 --> 02:41:57,665
Look, they're leaving. It appears
they didn't like the performance.

1695
02:41:57,666 --> 02:41:59,589
They didn't even stay
for the second act.

1696
02:42:00,669 --> 02:42:03,504
No, my friend, the performance
had nothing to do with it...

1697
02:42:03,505 --> 02:42:09,057
It appears our dear Alberto
de Magalhaes has seen a ghost.

1698
02:42:10,930 --> 02:42:14,140
Magnificent, yes indeed!
Who is she?

1699
02:42:14,141 --> 02:42:17,268
Elisa de Montfort.
The Duchess of Cliton.

1700
02:42:17,269 --> 02:42:19,145
Cliton, a French woman...

1701
02:42:19,146 --> 02:42:20,739
As French as one can be.

1702
02:42:21,023 --> 02:42:22,195
Is she the ghost?

1703
02:42:22,650 --> 02:42:24,118
In flesh and blood.

1704
02:42:24,526 --> 02:42:27,245
Our friend must have had
a fit when he saw her here.

1705
02:42:27,655 --> 02:42:29,407
Why, is there something
between them?

1706
02:42:29,823 --> 02:42:32,793
In Paris it was said they
had been lovers...

1707
02:42:34,328 --> 02:42:38,708
It seems the man behaved
like a genuine savage...

1708
02:42:39,667 --> 02:42:41,965
There was talk of tarnished
reputations and insults.

1709
02:42:41,966 --> 02:42:45,340
Shadowy stories about money.
There may have been bloodshed.

1710
02:42:45,673 --> 02:42:48,517
A duel of honor...
with one of her relatives.

1711
02:42:49,051 --> 02:42:52,806
What is certain is that our Leopoldo
Saavedra vanished rather suddenly,

1712
02:42:53,097 --> 02:42:55,850
and then in Brussels he was already
known as Tobias Navarro.

1713
02:42:57,726 --> 02:42:59,979
The lady Duchess
is also leaving.

1714
02:43:03,107 --> 02:43:05,735
Dear Baron de Sé,
what is your secret?

1715
02:43:06,110 --> 02:43:09,320
There isn't a beautiful woman
who escapes you.

1716
02:43:09,321 --> 02:43:12,245
Where did you meet that goddess
there whom you just approached?

1717
02:43:12,700 --> 02:43:15,419
To be honest, it was she
who approached me!

1718
02:43:15,703 --> 02:43:18,204
And she's not the first,
in any case...

1719
02:43:18,205 --> 02:43:19,956
She says we met in Paris!

1720
02:43:19,957 --> 02:43:22,426
Although I honestly don't remember...

1721
02:43:22,710 --> 02:43:25,179
My time there was spent
with so many pretty women!

1722
02:43:25,462 --> 02:43:28,181
She approached you, nevertheless,
and in what context?

1723
02:43:28,465 --> 02:43:30,217
I don't mean to be indiscreet!

1724
02:43:30,843 --> 02:43:33,642
She implored me to go and
visit her at the Isidro!

1725
02:43:34,221 --> 02:43:35,763
She has been lodging there.

1726
02:43:35,764 --> 02:43:38,267
Her request came under the pretext
of exchanging old memories...

1727
02:43:38,642 --> 02:43:40,895
"Souvenir, souvenir..."

1728
02:43:41,603 --> 02:43:45,403
But to me, something doesn't fit!
There's a mystery there.

1729
02:43:45,899 --> 02:43:49,027
Court, Royal Family,
Versailles...

1730
02:43:49,028 --> 02:43:50,871
Yet she wants to be known
as Madame Cliton,

1731
02:43:50,872 --> 02:43:52,786
like an ordinary "bourgeoisie".

1732
02:43:53,490 --> 02:43:57,870
I must hurry! It would be a sin
to miss the duet. We'll talk later.

1733
02:44:07,921 --> 02:44:09,762
I'm thinking of taking
all the artists here

1734
02:44:09,763 --> 02:44:11,259
away from the Sao Carlos Theatre.

1735
02:44:11,260 --> 02:44:13,509
Brazil must see these productions.

1736
02:44:13,510 --> 02:44:15,887
The second act is even better.

1737
02:44:15,888 --> 02:44:18,389
Yes, but unfortunately
I won't be able to stay.

1738
02:44:18,390 --> 02:44:20,609
Did you say the entire cast?

1739
02:44:20,934 --> 02:44:24,312
Yes, the chorus as well,
everyone.

1740
02:44:24,313 --> 02:44:25,735
That's a lot of people!

1741
02:44:26,398 --> 02:44:28,149
Brazil deserves it..

1742
02:44:28,150 --> 02:44:29,993
That woman is looking at you.

1743
02:44:30,652 --> 02:44:32,495
She has been following us
this whole time.

1744
02:44:33,072 --> 02:44:34,415
I had already noticed.

1745
02:44:34,823 --> 02:44:37,167
I knew her some time ago,
but I don't remember anymore.

1746
02:44:38,702 --> 02:44:39,828
Shall we go?

1747
02:44:40,287 --> 02:44:41,413
Shall we escape?

1748
02:44:42,915 --> 02:44:43,916
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1749
02:44:44,541 --> 02:44:45,713
Good evening.

1750
02:45:53,861 --> 02:45:55,113
A thousand pardons...

1751
02:45:55,114 --> 02:45:57,865
- I was told downstairs to come up.
- That was the order I gave.

1752
02:45:58,615 --> 02:46:00,492
I couldn't wait to see you.

1753
02:46:03,036 --> 02:46:04,787
I didn't come earlier,

1754
02:46:04,788 --> 02:46:07,248
because I feared I would be
bothering you.

1755
02:46:07,249 --> 02:46:10,001
I've been stifling my own
impatience since last night.

1756
02:46:10,002 --> 02:46:14,098
You exaggerate, I'm sure.
But I am flattered.

1757
02:46:15,007 --> 02:46:17,635
I thank you so much for
having come.

1758
02:46:19,261 --> 02:46:21,929
It brings me such happiness
to meet a familiar face

1759
02:46:21,930 --> 02:46:24,274
in a town where really
I know no one at all.

1760
02:46:25,058 --> 02:46:28,733
It would be an honor
to be your guide.

1761
02:46:29,188 --> 02:46:31,898
Please think of me as your servant.

1762
02:46:31,899 --> 02:46:33,401
I certainly intend to.

1763
02:46:36,153 --> 02:46:38,654
But it is I who shall be honored

1764
02:46:38,655 --> 02:46:41,283
to have as my guide
a man of your quality.

1765
02:46:43,327 --> 02:46:45,536
A very modest quality

1766
02:46:45,537 --> 02:46:49,041
compared to the charm and elegance
of Your Excellency...

1767
02:46:49,458 --> 02:46:51,256
It is my tea time.

1768
02:46:54,588 --> 02:46:57,262
I am counting on you
to keep me company...

1769
02:46:59,092 --> 02:47:03,142
I assure you, Madame,
in Portugal there is little conversation..

1770
02:47:04,431 --> 02:47:07,935
We are missing the words that
most captivate the ears.

1771
02:47:08,560 --> 02:47:11,234
Especially the Portuguese ladies.

1772
02:47:12,064 --> 02:47:15,989
In no way can one compare
them to French woman.

1773
02:47:16,360 --> 02:47:21,867
They lack the spirit, the spice,
the champagne!

1774
02:47:22,574 --> 02:47:24,367
I love the French!

1775
02:47:24,368 --> 02:47:26,086
The fortunate Parisian!

1776
02:47:26,703 --> 02:47:30,253
With this ardor you must have
had enormous success there.

1777
02:47:31,083 --> 02:47:34,303
If you permit me, Madame,

1778
02:47:34,878 --> 02:47:39,006
I can tell you without vanity that

1779
02:47:39,007 --> 02:47:43,353
I have taken fortresses that
would have made others desist.

1780
02:47:46,139 --> 02:47:47,436
I am most convinced.

1781
02:47:47,724 --> 02:47:50,694
I'm convinced just by watching
and hearing you.

1782
02:47:51,103 --> 02:47:53,854
But permit me to question you,
in return,

1783
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:56,732
whether all the Portuguese
are as you say...

1784
02:47:56,733 --> 02:48:00,111
For example, the lady with whom
I saw you chatting yesterday

1785
02:48:00,112 --> 02:48:01,159
at the opera...

1786
02:48:02,739 --> 02:48:05,866
Ah, yes: Eugenia de Magalhaes.

1787
02:48:05,867 --> 02:48:07,744
Eugenia. Pretty name...

1788
02:48:10,539 --> 02:48:11,461
And his name?

1789
02:48:11,748 --> 02:48:12,840
His name?

1790
02:48:15,127 --> 02:48:16,003
His name...

1791
02:48:17,296 --> 02:48:21,017
Ah! Alberto.
Alberto de Magalhaes.

1792
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:22,142
Alberto.

1793
02:48:23,010 --> 02:48:24,353
Eugenia and Alberto.

1794
02:48:25,887 --> 02:48:27,638
They're married, of course...

1795
02:48:27,639 --> 02:48:28,806
Of course...

1796
02:48:28,807 --> 02:48:30,104
For long?

1797
02:48:31,393 --> 02:48:33,144
About a year now.

1798
02:48:33,145 --> 02:48:34,937
I'd like to meet him.

1799
02:48:34,938 --> 02:48:35,689
The couple?

1800
02:48:35,690 --> 02:48:37,282
No. Just him.

1801
02:48:38,650 --> 02:48:40,568
Alberto de Magalhaes?!

1802
02:48:40,569 --> 02:48:42,242
Do you find that impossible?

1803
02:48:43,530 --> 02:48:45,953
For a man such as myself, Madame,
nothing is impossible.

1804
02:48:45,954 --> 02:48:47,747
But you find it "inconvenient".

1805
02:48:48,785 --> 02:48:51,037
For someone like Your Excellency,

1806
02:48:51,038 --> 02:48:53,587
"inconvenience" does not exist.

1807
02:48:53,915 --> 02:48:59,422
But your interest, let us say,
in this man...

1808
02:49:01,173 --> 02:49:02,766
How shall I put it?

1809
02:49:06,970 --> 02:49:08,347
Well, it intrigues me. That's all!

1810
02:49:09,556 --> 02:49:10,478
Interest?!

1811
02:49:11,725 --> 02:49:13,272
Let's not exaggerate.

1812
02:49:13,560 --> 02:49:16,234
What is of interest are
my devotions to Your Excellency.

1813
02:49:16,688 --> 02:49:19,032
For him, I have merely curiosity.

1814
02:49:20,984 --> 02:49:24,488
If it is simply to satisfy curiosity,
I will take you to him tomorrow.

1815
02:49:25,072 --> 02:49:27,700
I would prefer that you send him
to me alone.

1816
02:49:28,700 --> 02:49:32,796
I don't like to mix intimate friends
with vulgar acquaintances...

1817
02:49:33,455 --> 02:49:35,628
Your wishes are my commands.

1818
02:50:27,134 --> 02:50:31,981
Forgive me, I had to leave for a minute.
But I'm counting on your support.

1819
02:50:32,681 --> 02:50:34,228
You delight me, Madame.

1820
02:50:36,518 --> 02:50:37,770
You delight me.

1821
02:50:39,646 --> 02:50:42,024
- You delight me.
- I understood!

1822
02:50:42,899 --> 02:50:44,651
Money is in the high seas!

1823
02:50:49,656 --> 02:50:50,748
Hello, Alberto!

1824
02:50:51,283 --> 02:50:54,002
I'm sorry to bother you,
just a few seconds.

1825
02:50:56,079 --> 02:50:57,376
Of course, Baron.

1826
02:51:02,461 --> 02:51:04,179
Make yourself comfortable, have a seat.

1827
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:08,051
I won't be long. I can't be late.
They're waiting for me on the corner.

1828
02:51:09,468 --> 02:51:13,939
Here it is! Someone implored me
to deliver a message...

1829
02:51:14,556 --> 02:51:16,308
An invitation, actually.

1830
02:51:17,309 --> 02:51:20,358
A friend of mine, a close friend,
very close.

1831
02:51:20,729 --> 02:51:24,404
A lady from high society...
French.

1832
02:51:25,358 --> 02:51:28,737
An acquaintance from Paris.
Madame Cliton.

1833
02:51:34,951 --> 02:51:35,918
The Duchess?

1834
02:51:39,080 --> 02:51:40,332
Do you know her?

1835
02:51:40,874 --> 02:51:45,377
The Duchess? Yes, of course...
Yes, the Duchess!

1836
02:51:45,378 --> 02:51:48,131
Intimately!
I know her intimately!

1837
02:51:49,591 --> 02:51:52,720
But don't tell me,
you also know her?

1838
02:51:54,221 --> 02:51:55,848
I've heard her name spoken.

1839
02:51:56,973 --> 02:51:58,350
I see, of course...

1840
02:51:59,351 --> 02:52:01,524
Well, I spoke to her about you.

1841
02:52:02,229 --> 02:52:04,698
I piqued her curiosity, I think.

1842
02:52:05,148 --> 02:52:08,402
In summary,
she would like to meet you.

1843
02:52:08,985 --> 02:52:11,989
Simple curiosity. No bad intentions.

1844
02:52:12,405 --> 02:52:17,662
You know the French:
Free, direct, unprejudiced.

1845
02:52:19,287 --> 02:52:23,633
So there, she's at the Isidro.
She receives visits from five until seven.

1846
02:53:24,436 --> 02:53:26,609
Mister Magalhaes has arrived.

1847
02:53:30,609 --> 02:53:31,656
You may come in.

1848
02:53:34,571 --> 02:53:36,790
You wanted to see me?
Here I am.

1849
02:53:37,949 --> 02:53:39,576
What do you want of me.

1850
02:53:42,454 --> 02:53:44,297
To pay you what I owe you.

1851
02:53:50,378 --> 02:53:51,220
Nothing.

1852
02:53:53,465 --> 02:53:54,887
You owe me nothing.

1853
02:53:56,343 --> 02:53:57,890
Nor do I owe you anything.

1854
02:53:58,720 --> 02:54:01,849
We have both respected
the terms of our transaction.

1855
02:54:02,223 --> 02:54:04,016
The balance has been paid in full.

1856
02:54:04,017 --> 02:54:06,941
No. The balance is right there.

1857
02:54:09,731 --> 02:54:12,484
It has burned my fingers
and my soul for years.

1858
02:54:12,776 --> 02:54:14,244
Take it. It's yours.

1859
02:54:23,745 --> 02:54:24,962
Is that all?

1860
02:54:25,413 --> 02:54:26,505
Does she know?

1861
02:54:26,790 --> 02:54:28,087
Who?

1862
02:54:28,541 --> 02:54:30,669
Eugenia.
That is her name, isn't it?

1863
02:54:31,252 --> 02:54:36,008
I see that fool of a Baron has
spoken of her to you as well.

1864
02:54:36,424 --> 02:54:40,429
But no, she doesn't know.
And I don't want her to know.

1865
02:54:41,054 --> 02:54:44,139
Watch yourself,
if she learns of any of this!

1866
02:54:44,140 --> 02:54:49,442
There are chasms in my life
I don't want her dangling over.

1867
02:54:52,148 --> 02:54:56,824
Feelings you couldn't
possibly understand.

1868
02:54:59,322 --> 02:55:02,826
Get going, Elisa.
Return to France.

1869
02:55:04,911 --> 02:55:08,165
It's useless to try and see me again.

1870
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:13,011
Forget me, as I have forgotten you.

1871
02:55:14,212 --> 02:55:19,139
The past doesn't rewrite itself,
and the dead never rise again.

1872
02:56:53,269 --> 02:56:55,771
You're not going to have me
eat lunch all alone?

1873
02:56:55,772 --> 02:56:58,273
What kind of Christian charity is that?

1874
02:56:58,274 --> 02:57:00,818
Nothing would give me more pleasure,
my child.

1875
02:57:00,819 --> 02:57:02,787
Unfortunately,
the Countess of Santa Barbara

1876
02:57:02,788 --> 02:57:05,072
is waiting for me
in the Convent of Odivelas.

1877
02:57:05,073 --> 02:57:08,293
I'm the only visitor she has left,
since her son left for France.

1878
02:57:10,787 --> 02:57:14,508
There is a foreign lady downstairs.
She's asking for you.

1879
02:57:15,291 --> 02:57:18,710
Foreign? Did she give her name?

1880
02:57:18,711 --> 02:57:21,046
If she did, I didn't understand,
my lady.

1881
02:57:21,047 --> 02:57:22,840
She speaks in her own manner.

1882
02:57:22,841 --> 02:57:26,391
But I did understand that she's
a friend of Sir Alberto.

1883
02:57:27,971 --> 02:57:29,018
A friend?

1884
02:57:30,807 --> 02:57:31,974
Send her up.

1885
02:57:31,975 --> 02:57:34,148
Yes, Madame, excuse me.

1886
02:57:37,856 --> 02:57:38,982
How amusing...

1887
02:57:40,233 --> 02:57:43,235
She's the first acquaintance
I've met of Alberto's...

1888
02:57:43,236 --> 02:57:45,989
apart from you, of course, Father.

1889
02:57:46,865 --> 02:57:49,539
Well, I'll be going...

1890
02:57:49,951 --> 02:57:52,204
At least I leave you with company.

1891
02:58:46,007 --> 02:58:47,304
Sit down, please.

1892
02:58:49,802 --> 02:58:51,770
He's funny, your butler.

1893
02:58:52,805 --> 02:58:57,106
Poor man, he's ill.
Alberto took him under his wing.

1894
02:58:57,894 --> 02:58:59,396
He's like a son to him.

1895
02:59:00,271 --> 02:59:03,241
I hope you'll forgive this intrusion
by a stranger...

1896
02:59:03,775 --> 02:59:05,275
Not a complete stranger...

1897
02:59:05,276 --> 02:59:06,693
You know who I am?!

1898
02:59:06,694 --> 02:59:08,992
No. But I have seen you before.

1899
02:59:09,906 --> 02:59:13,251
Of course, the day before yesterday.
At the opera.

1900
02:59:14,661 --> 02:59:17,079
I thought you hadn't even noticed me...

1901
02:59:17,080 --> 02:59:19,299
It is impossible not to notice you.

1902
02:59:19,666 --> 02:59:21,792
Should I take that as a compliment?

1903
02:59:21,793 --> 02:59:23,887
Take it as you wish, Madame...

1904
02:59:24,712 --> 02:59:28,048
But I beg your pardon:
I didn't catch your name...

1905
02:59:28,049 --> 02:59:29,642
Elisa de Montfort.

1906
02:59:30,927 --> 02:59:33,303
And you are a friend of Alberto's...

1907
02:59:33,304 --> 02:59:37,104
How strange! He has never
spoken about you to me!

1908
02:59:37,850 --> 02:59:40,103
You haven't any reason
to worry,

1909
02:59:40,603 --> 02:59:42,854
our dealings are strictly commercial.

1910
02:59:42,855 --> 02:59:47,452
I am not worried, Madame de Montfort.
I have complete faith in my husband.

1911
02:59:48,111 --> 02:59:52,582
I don't doubt it. He's very good at
winning the confidence of women...

1912
02:59:55,243 --> 02:59:58,588
You still haven't told me
the purpose of your visit.

1913
03:00:00,873 --> 03:00:02,708
I have come to pay a debt.

1914
03:00:02,709 --> 03:00:05,085
A debt? To me?

1915
03:00:05,086 --> 03:00:06,258
To your husband.

1916
03:00:07,213 --> 03:00:09,131
I assume you don't live together

1917
03:00:09,132 --> 03:00:11,009
under the terms of separation
of property.

1918
03:00:11,010 --> 03:00:14,011
I prefer that you settle
your accounts with him directly.

1919
03:00:14,012 --> 03:00:16,390
I am not used to meddling in his affairs.

1920
03:00:17,223 --> 03:00:19,396
If I've understood correctly,
he is away.

1921
03:00:20,393 --> 03:00:23,854
Anyway, I was curious to see,
up close,

1922
03:00:23,855 --> 03:00:26,483
the woman who made Alberto
lay down is guard.

1923
03:00:27,650 --> 03:00:28,993
I have no regrets.

1924
03:00:30,111 --> 03:00:34,082
Your beauty adds further justice
to his great reputation in Europe.

1925
03:00:35,033 --> 03:00:38,118
Unfortunately for you,
it is not his only reputation...

1926
03:00:38,119 --> 03:00:41,038
But it won't take you long
to discover that for yourself.

1927
03:00:41,039 --> 03:00:42,632
If you haven't already...

1928
03:00:43,875 --> 03:00:46,501
From now on you may
count on my compassion.

1929
03:00:46,502 --> 03:00:47,845
Goodbye, Madame.

1930
03:00:49,005 --> 03:00:50,928
Madame! Your purse!

1931
03:00:52,550 --> 03:00:55,224
Take it, if you please.
I cannot accept it.

1932
03:00:56,012 --> 03:00:57,685
You are well obliged to.

1933
03:00:58,639 --> 03:01:00,141
Unless you attach it

1934
03:01:01,017 --> 03:01:02,769
by force around my neck...

1935
03:01:30,838 --> 03:01:34,968
Come in, Duchess, come in.

1936
03:01:36,177 --> 03:01:37,975
Do not fear me.

1937
03:01:38,971 --> 03:01:40,473
I wish you no ill will.

1938
03:01:45,561 --> 03:01:48,314
I am here on behalf
of Blanche de Montfort.

1939
03:01:52,568 --> 03:01:53,785
My mother...

1940
03:01:54,570 --> 03:01:57,949
My friend. Sit down, my girl.

1941
03:02:05,248 --> 03:02:08,798
You knew her?
You knew my mother?

1942
03:02:10,253 --> 03:02:15,054
I was quite close to her.
She died in my arms.

1943
03:02:16,592 --> 03:02:19,845
But I recognize you!
I saw you this morning!

1944
03:02:19,846 --> 03:02:22,139
I saw you at that man's house...

1945
03:02:22,140 --> 03:02:26,270
Alberto de Magalhaes...
Or Leopoldo Saavedra, if you prefer...

1946
03:02:26,978 --> 03:02:29,354
You Know about all that?

1947
03:02:29,355 --> 03:02:33,326
I know almost everything, Duchess.
I know too much.

1948
03:02:34,485 --> 03:02:37,329
I would have preferred not
to know so much...

1949
03:02:37,864 --> 03:02:39,241
But who are you?

1950
03:02:40,116 --> 03:02:43,285
Call me Father Dinis,
young lady.

1951
03:02:43,286 --> 03:02:46,165
I've had other names,
just like Alberto de Magalhaes.

1952
03:02:46,998 --> 03:02:49,626
I've been other men.
But they are all dead.

1953
03:02:50,418 --> 03:02:54,045
They died at the same time
as those whom they held most dear...

1954
03:02:54,046 --> 03:02:56,640
Like your mother.
Like Blanche de Montfort.

1955
03:03:03,306 --> 03:03:06,276
I beg your pardon,
just one moment...

1956
03:03:08,060 --> 03:03:11,405
I'm not well...
I'm feeling dizzy...

1957
03:03:12,064 --> 03:03:17,912
It will pass. Just give me a moment...
I shall return immediately.

1958
03:04:30,101 --> 03:04:32,727
But what did she say to you?
What did she tell you?

1959
03:04:32,728 --> 03:04:34,896
Nothing! Apart from
what I've told you, nothing!

1960
03:04:34,897 --> 03:04:38,358
She referred only to the debt.
She never said what, or why.

1961
03:04:38,359 --> 03:04:39,734
She made insinuations.

1962
03:04:39,735 --> 03:04:41,487
I really don't know what
she meant at all...

1963
03:04:41,488 --> 03:04:43,154
But the worst was her bitterness!

1964
03:04:43,155 --> 03:04:46,157
The hatred I sensed in her voice!
Toward you, and toward me!

1965
03:04:46,158 --> 03:04:48,001
A certain desire to do us harm!

1966
03:05:00,298 --> 03:05:03,051
It's my fault.
I should have told you everything.

1967
03:05:03,384 --> 03:05:04,258
I should have told you.

1968
03:05:04,259 --> 03:05:05,807
No! I don't want to know!
I don't want to know anything!

1969
03:05:05,808 --> 03:05:08,263
Don't tell me anything,
I'm not interested!

1970
03:05:08,264 --> 03:05:11,766
It has nothing to do with us.
It's not a part of our life.

1971
03:05:11,767 --> 03:05:13,565
If you tell me,
it's as if it mattered,

1972
03:05:13,566 --> 03:05:15,186
or that it will matter.

1973
03:05:15,187 --> 03:05:17,022
Don't tell me anything.

1974
03:05:17,023 --> 03:05:18,445
Otherwise, she wins.

1975
03:05:20,067 --> 03:05:21,568
My fear is that she will hurt you.

1976
03:05:21,569 --> 03:05:23,367
No, stop! Don't be afraid.

1977
03:05:24,196 --> 03:05:26,119
She can't do anything to me.

1978
03:05:26,407 --> 03:05:29,035
And if she did something to you...

1979
03:05:38,044 --> 03:05:39,216
I would kill her.

1980
03:05:44,175 --> 03:05:45,472
I would kill her!

1981
03:06:13,496 --> 03:06:15,169
I was born in Venice.

1982
03:06:16,374 --> 03:06:18,208
My parents had taken refuge there

1983
03:06:18,209 --> 03:06:20,712
to escape the scorn
of a wronged husband.

1984
03:06:22,713 --> 03:06:28,095
But their escape was not enough
to avoid God's punishment...

1985
03:06:28,844 --> 03:06:32,144
Two years later, before his death,

1986
03:06:33,265 --> 03:06:36,394
Don Paulo entrusted me,
in turn, to the Marquis of Luso,

1987
03:06:36,769 --> 03:06:38,362
who took me to France,

1988
03:06:38,646 --> 03:06:43,277
where he was appointed for a
diplomatic mission in the town of Caen.

1989
03:06:44,110 --> 03:06:47,330
It is there that we were surprised
by the taking of the Bastille,

1990
03:06:47,738 --> 03:06:51,032
and the bloodshed that followed...

1991
03:06:51,033 --> 03:06:54,412
His relationship with a citizen of
Caen, Charlotte Corday,

1992
03:06:54,745 --> 03:06:57,914
and the revolutionary fervor she
incited within him,

1993
03:06:57,915 --> 03:07:00,750
led the Marquis straight to the gallows.

1994
03:07:00,751 --> 03:07:04,881
I was finally taken into the care
of an old friend of the Marquis de Luso.

1995
03:07:05,548 --> 03:07:09,769
Your grandfather, Madame Duchess,
Raymond de Montfort...

1996
03:07:12,304 --> 03:07:13,806
Whom I never knew...

1997
03:07:15,266 --> 03:07:17,064
He welcomed me like a son.

1998
03:07:17,768 --> 03:07:20,145
And your father, Benoit de Montfort,

1999
03:07:20,146 --> 03:07:21,398
like a brother...

2000
03:07:21,772 --> 03:07:24,566
Benoit and I grew up together.

2001
03:07:24,567 --> 03:07:27,527
We discovered together,
little by little,

2002
03:07:27,528 --> 03:07:29,446
the mysteries of Nature.

2003
03:07:29,447 --> 03:07:33,543
We both fell in love the same day
with the same young lady:

2004
03:07:34,160 --> 03:07:36,788
Blanche de Clermont.
A descendant of kings,

2005
03:07:37,163 --> 03:07:39,791
she was the most modest
and most beautiful of all...

2006
03:07:40,166 --> 03:07:43,670
My mother, Blanche de Montfort...
I never knew her, either.

2007
03:07:44,420 --> 03:07:48,050
She was the most beautiful
and the most modest...

2008
03:07:48,466 --> 03:07:51,515
To us, she was an angel,
who had fallen to earth,

2009
03:07:52,178 --> 03:07:55,148
among men who could not speak
the language of Heaven...

2010
03:07:55,806 --> 03:08:00,310
Both of us had stolen a scarf from her,
secretly, without the other knowing.

2011
03:08:00,311 --> 03:08:02,814
They accompanied us,
close against our hearts,

2012
03:08:03,189 --> 03:08:07,365
through every campaign we led together
under the Emperor's command.

2013
03:08:07,985 --> 03:08:12,081
Montebello, Malta, Alexandria,
Aboukir...

2014
03:08:12,865 --> 03:08:16,415
Up to Portugal, as far as Buçaco,
with Masséna...

2015
03:08:16,702 --> 03:08:20,332
There, we both saved a man's life
together...

2016
03:08:20,748 --> 03:08:24,252
A man who would eventually be the ruin
of Benoit and Blanche:

2017
03:08:24,710 --> 03:08:26,712
Colonel Ernest Lacroze.

2018
03:08:32,134 --> 03:08:34,182
Hoist the flag, in front!

2019
03:08:36,472 --> 03:08:37,644
Halt!

2020
03:08:38,224 --> 03:08:39,567
To the left, turn!

2021
03:08:40,392 --> 03:08:42,190
To the rear! March!

2022
03:08:50,027 --> 03:08:50,949
Halt!

2023
03:08:51,403 --> 03:08:52,825
To the left, turn!

2024
03:09:25,771 --> 03:09:27,273
Prepare arms!

2025
03:09:29,275 --> 03:09:30,367
Aim!

2026
03:09:31,652 --> 03:09:32,574
Fire!

2027
03:10:17,239 --> 03:10:18,411
Ready,

2028
03:10:21,994 --> 03:10:23,086
Aim!

2029
03:10:24,705 --> 03:10:26,082
Long live the Emperor!

2030
03:10:48,228 --> 03:10:50,981
Colonel Ernest Lacroze,
of the Imperial Guard.

2031
03:10:51,357 --> 03:10:55,863
Five minutes more and our heads
would have been placed on a stake.

2032
03:10:56,612 --> 03:10:59,707
I owe you my life, gentlemen
and I will never forget it...

2033
03:11:03,494 --> 03:11:06,998
Nurse, quickly!
Come quickly, Nurse!

2034
03:11:40,656 --> 03:11:43,825
He lay between life and death.

2035
03:11:43,826 --> 03:11:48,002
During the entire time our troops
were retreating from Portugal,

2036
03:11:49,081 --> 03:11:52,381
after the defeats of Buçaco
and Torres Vedras...

2037
03:11:53,585 --> 03:11:58,432
Benoit de Montfort spent every
free moment he had by his side...

2038
03:11:59,717 --> 03:12:01,970
to the point of making me jealous...

2039
03:12:03,053 --> 03:12:06,222
He ended up convincing him
to come with us to the castle

2040
03:12:06,223 --> 03:12:07,816
during his recovery.

2041
03:12:09,226 --> 03:12:14,323
Thus building with his own hands,
the tragedy which was soon to come...

2042
03:12:17,568 --> 03:12:18,615
Benoit, come look!

2043
03:12:31,832 --> 03:12:35,336
You look like the spy
we caught behind the lines, in Aboukir.

2044
03:12:36,962 --> 03:12:39,255
With the same assassin's gaze!

2045
03:12:39,256 --> 03:12:42,842
Your guest has a curious way
of repaying your hospitality...

2046
03:12:42,843 --> 03:12:44,891
He spends his days with Blanche!

2047
03:12:45,512 --> 03:12:47,731
Soon, he'll be spending
his nights with her, too...

2048
03:12:48,223 --> 03:12:52,319
What a thought! That's absurd!
He does it out of kindness.

2049
03:12:53,103 --> 03:12:54,821
Gut of gratitude, really.

2050
03:12:55,856 --> 03:12:57,483
How naive, Benoit!

2051
03:12:57,983 --> 03:13:00,651
What a ridiculous thought!

2052
03:13:00,652 --> 03:13:02,575
Wake up, in the name of God!

2053
03:13:03,155 --> 03:13:06,375
Open your eyes, you idiot,
open your eyes!

2054
03:13:17,920 --> 03:13:19,137
Idiot.

2055
03:13:40,651 --> 03:13:41,994
Where did Benoit go?

2056
03:13:43,529 --> 03:13:44,826
I think he's in there.

2057
03:14:35,330 --> 03:14:37,458
Were you jealous, Father?

2058
03:14:37,958 --> 03:14:41,586
I was by far the more jealous
of the two of us.

2059
03:14:41,587 --> 03:14:43,715
My Lusitanian blood,
no doubt...

2060
03:14:45,090 --> 03:14:48,640
But it didn't take long
for Benoit to surpass my jealousy.

2061
03:14:49,761 --> 03:14:53,723
It's true I never missed
an opportunity to draw his attention

2062
03:14:53,724 --> 03:14:56,193
to Blanche and Ernest's behavior.

2063
03:15:07,362 --> 03:15:09,490
I don't see Mademoiselle Blanche...

2064
03:15:10,157 --> 03:15:12,501
I wouldn't want to go without
bidding her farewell. Did you warn her?

2065
03:15:12,868 --> 03:15:15,369
I told her you were leaving, yes.

2066
03:15:15,370 --> 03:15:17,748
But she feared she might
not be able to come.

2067
03:15:18,165 --> 03:15:20,964
Some story about dresses
ordered in Angouleme...

2068
03:15:21,668 --> 03:15:22,840
Women!

2069
03:15:24,004 --> 03:15:26,923
She should have left this morning
with her father.

2070
03:15:26,924 --> 03:15:29,973
But all of this is unimportant:
I will convey your respects to her.

2071
03:15:30,302 --> 03:15:31,269
A shame.

2072
03:15:32,304 --> 03:15:34,639
In fact, I scribbled a small note

2073
03:15:34,640 --> 03:15:36,267
just in case I didn't see her.

2074
03:15:36,558 --> 03:15:38,184
To thank her for the kindness

2075
03:15:38,185 --> 03:15:40,938
of her hospitality and for her company.

2076
03:15:43,023 --> 03:15:44,400
Would you be so kind?

2077
03:15:45,192 --> 03:15:47,661
Of course, you can count on me.

2078
03:15:49,279 --> 03:15:52,249
Thank you, my friend.
Thank you for everything.

2079
03:15:53,784 --> 03:15:57,129
I will not forget Buçaco. And I
will always remember Montfort.

2080
03:16:00,082 --> 03:16:03,928
Little by little, Benoit's jealousy
became obsessive.

2081
03:16:05,087 --> 03:16:06,837
Under the pretext of being helpful,

2082
03:16:06,838 --> 03:16:09,182
he kept trying to convince the
Emperor to give Colonel Lacroze

2083
03:16:09,183 --> 03:16:13,224
the command of a garrison lost
at the far end of Calabria.

2084
03:16:13,971 --> 03:16:17,225
Far from everything.
And, most of all, from Blanche...

2085
03:17:05,897 --> 03:17:09,151
Careful, Jerome,
don't set the castle on fire!

2086
03:17:10,861 --> 03:17:12,862
No danger, my commander.

2087
03:17:12,863 --> 03:17:15,036
Even the English,
couldn't manage to burn it down.

2088
03:17:15,657 --> 03:17:17,867
It was made the old-fashioned way.

2089
03:17:17,868 --> 03:17:19,290
It won't catch fire.

2090
03:17:20,245 --> 03:17:20,837
Blanche...

2091
03:17:21,747 --> 03:17:24,498
The departure of Ernest Lacroze
did not cause many consequences

2092
03:17:24,499 --> 03:17:26,249
to my relationship with
Blanche de Clermont...

2093
03:17:26,250 --> 03:17:26,877
Come see.

2094
03:17:27,919 --> 03:17:31,005
Only that from then on,
instead of the colonel,

2095
03:17:31,006 --> 03:17:33,930
It was Benoit
who monopolized her company...

2096
03:17:37,637 --> 03:17:39,310
There he is, spying on us.

2097
03:17:41,183 --> 03:17:42,480
You ought to kiss me,

2098
03:17:43,769 --> 03:17:45,692
just to make him burst with jealousy.

2099
03:17:47,522 --> 03:17:48,739
Come closer!

2100
03:17:57,407 --> 03:17:59,080
I don't want him to die.

2101
03:17:59,910 --> 03:18:01,753
And I don't want to kiss you.

2102
03:18:02,537 --> 03:18:04,580
I resigned myself
little by little, to the fact

2103
03:18:04,581 --> 03:18:06,549
that they would end up
getting married.

2104
03:18:07,167 --> 03:18:09,044
And though that made me suffer,

2105
03:18:09,336 --> 03:18:13,011
it was more bearable than thinking
she might marry someone else.

2106
03:18:13,340 --> 03:18:14,557
A foreigner.

2107
03:18:15,050 --> 03:18:17,098
Like Ernest Lacroze or worse!

2108
03:18:37,072 --> 03:18:38,415
You are tired, Father.

2109
03:18:39,449 --> 03:18:41,076
Would you like to rest?

2110
03:18:41,827 --> 03:18:44,330
No, my girl, it's not fatigue...

2111
03:18:46,206 --> 03:18:48,925
it's the pain of recalling that moment...

2112
03:18:49,835 --> 03:18:55,012
when Benoit de Montfort sold his soul
in exchange for Blanche de Clermont...

2113
03:18:57,592 --> 03:19:00,266
It was on that day
that everything changed.

2114
03:19:01,346 --> 03:19:04,850
It was then that he decided
to sacrifice everything.

2115
03:19:05,892 --> 03:19:11,774
His friends, his honor, and with one
sole purpose: to have Blanche.

2116
03:19:12,649 --> 03:19:15,985
Later, I learned that he had
intercepted all the letters,

2117
03:19:15,986 --> 03:19:18,785
that colonel Lacroze
had sent to Blanche.

2118
03:19:20,157 --> 03:19:22,366
Have you not heard more news
of Colonel Lacroze?

2119
03:19:22,367 --> 03:19:23,334
No.

2120
03:19:24,035 --> 03:19:26,413
That's strange.
Don't you think?

2121
03:19:27,247 --> 03:19:28,965
What's strange about it?

2122
03:19:29,875 --> 03:19:31,877
Military life is like that, you know.

2123
03:19:32,544 --> 03:19:34,638
Made up of meetings and separations.

2124
03:19:35,797 --> 03:19:37,765
Today here, tomorrow over there.

2125
03:19:39,676 --> 03:19:42,761
From battle to battle, garrison
to garrison, country to country...

2126
03:19:42,762 --> 03:19:44,514
For them it's best not to become
attached to anything.

2127
03:19:47,642 --> 03:19:50,895
That was not how I saw him.
Quite the contrary.

2128
03:19:50,896 --> 03:19:54,025
He left me the memory
of a man faithful in friendship,

2129
03:19:54,566 --> 03:20:00,539
dedicated, sincere, attentive,
and accountable...

2130
03:20:04,910 --> 03:20:08,162
Enough, that's sufficient, stop!

2131
03:20:08,163 --> 03:20:10,541
That is not a man, you describe.
That is "Prince Charming"!

2132
03:20:12,209 --> 03:20:14,837
Instead, admit that he courted you.

2133
03:20:16,421 --> 03:20:17,217
That is to say,

2134
03:20:17,218 --> 03:20:20,559
he played the role he thought
would be best to seduce you.

2135
03:20:22,719 --> 03:20:24,720
It's true: he courted me.

2136
03:20:24,721 --> 03:20:26,689
But he wasn't playing any role.

2137
03:20:27,682 --> 03:20:28,649
He was sincere.

2138
03:20:30,101 --> 03:20:31,899
I know he was sincere.

2139
03:20:32,562 --> 03:20:35,907
Sincere to the point of not
seeing you before he left,

2140
03:20:37,734 --> 03:20:40,203
of leaving without a word of farewell?

2141
03:20:45,367 --> 03:20:46,334
Blanche,

2142
03:20:49,246 --> 03:20:50,418
did something happen
between you?

2143
03:20:50,705 --> 03:20:52,548
I did not delude myself.

2144
03:20:53,708 --> 03:20:56,086
The Emperor had just given
Benoit the title of Duke.

2145
03:20:56,461 --> 03:20:57,838
Something happened.

2146
03:20:58,129 --> 03:20:59,255
I was just an orphan.

2147
03:20:59,256 --> 03:21:02,100
Without a father, a mother,
or even a country.

2148
03:22:16,583 --> 03:22:19,462
Blanche's father, Richard de Clermont,

2149
03:22:19,836 --> 03:22:23,047
kept harassing
her for a decision.

2150
03:22:23,048 --> 03:22:26,518
And even the Emperor, they had said,
wanted this marriage.

2151
03:22:41,858 --> 03:22:43,485
It's not hot today.

2152
03:22:55,580 --> 03:22:58,749
Benoit's obstinacy,
her father's persistence,

2153
03:22:58,750 --> 03:23:03,221
and the will of the Emperor himself,
toppled Blanche's resistance all together.

2154
03:23:05,340 --> 03:23:09,186
But the news of Lacroze's suicide
had something to do with her decision.

2155
03:23:10,345 --> 03:23:13,138
In spite of that,
your mother added a condition

2156
03:23:13,139 --> 03:23:16,860
that the ceremony would take place
without any splendor. And in intimacy.

2157
03:23:17,977 --> 03:23:20,651
There was no banquet.
Nor a honeymoon...

2158
03:23:36,996 --> 03:23:41,126
Blanche!

2159
03:23:41,668 --> 03:23:43,215
Come back! Blanche!

2160
03:23:46,131 --> 03:23:48,054
Blanche, where are you going?

2161
03:23:48,925 --> 03:23:50,973
I'm going to the hunting lodge.

2162
03:23:51,761 --> 03:23:52,978
I need to be alone.

2163
03:23:53,263 --> 03:23:54,264
Blanche!

2164
03:23:54,639 --> 03:23:55,931
Poor wedding.

2165
03:23:55,932 --> 03:23:57,015
Poor mother.

2166
03:23:57,016 --> 03:23:58,768
My poor family.

2167
03:23:59,269 --> 03:24:01,770
With these origins,
it's not surprising

2168
03:24:01,771 --> 03:24:04,445
that my whole life
has been branded by the iron of evil.

2169
03:24:04,816 --> 03:24:07,317
That iron is the fate of everyone,
my girl.

2170
03:24:07,318 --> 03:24:08,615
Perhaps, Father.

2171
03:24:09,028 --> 03:24:11,907
But then, it's the distribution
that is not done fairly.

2172
03:24:14,784 --> 03:24:17,536
Did you see her very much,
after the wedding?

2173
03:24:17,537 --> 03:24:19,130
Did you speak with her?

2174
03:24:19,581 --> 03:24:20,753
Unfortunately, no.

2175
03:24:21,207 --> 03:24:23,630
I left the castle of Montfort
that same day.

2176
03:24:24,294 --> 03:24:26,795
There was nothing that kept me
there any longer.

2177
03:24:26,796 --> 03:24:30,471
Benoit was no longer the same
and old Raymond was almost senile.

2178
03:24:31,718 --> 03:24:35,097
I was overtaken by the desire
to return to Portugal,

2179
03:24:36,181 --> 03:24:38,682
to strengthen my bond with
the country of my ancestors,

2180
03:24:38,683 --> 03:24:40,685
which I had until now, only glimpsed.

2181
03:24:41,811 --> 03:24:43,484
But I was in no hurry.

2182
03:24:44,564 --> 03:24:47,158
I used the occasion to get to know
France better.

2183
03:24:48,234 --> 03:24:51,408
And to sell off the few possessions
I owned here and there...

2184
03:24:54,949 --> 03:24:56,121
The months went by.

2185
03:24:57,452 --> 03:24:59,369
I found myself in Bordeaux,

2186
03:24:59,370 --> 03:25:02,920
when I received news that Blanche
had just given birth to twins.

2187
03:25:03,208 --> 03:25:07,338
You, Madame Duchess,
and your brother, Arthur.

2188
03:25:08,838 --> 03:25:11,387
I couldn't resist the temptation
to return.

2189
03:25:43,748 --> 03:25:45,625
Good old Sebastiao!

2190
03:25:49,754 --> 03:25:51,347
I knew you'd come back.

2191
03:25:54,551 --> 03:25:57,145
They all end up coming back
sooner or later.

2192
03:26:00,265 --> 03:26:01,562
She will as well, you'll see.

2193
03:26:06,521 --> 03:26:09,991
Your room is just as you had left it.
Get yourself settled in.

2194
03:26:11,276 --> 03:26:13,699
But it's best if you take
your bag up yourself.

2195
03:26:14,904 --> 03:26:16,497
We are lacking staff at the moment...

2196
03:26:21,202 --> 03:26:21,873
Oh!

2197
03:26:22,829 --> 03:26:24,706
Old Raymond has passed away.

2198
03:26:26,332 --> 03:26:29,711
In his sleep. He didn't suffer.

2199
03:26:33,214 --> 03:26:34,966
I inherited his armchair.

2200
03:26:35,717 --> 03:26:38,311
It's quite practical.
You'll have to try it.

2201
03:26:39,804 --> 03:26:40,851
And Blanche?

2202
03:26:42,724 --> 03:26:43,976
And the children?

2203
03:26:46,686 --> 03:26:49,064
Madame de Montfort makes
her home apart from mine.

2204
03:26:49,065 --> 03:26:50,440
She's with the children.

2205
03:26:51,941 --> 03:26:55,991
When she got pregnant, she
moved into the hunting lodge.

2206
03:26:57,488 --> 03:26:59,456
It seems this whole business
was too painful for her.

2207
03:27:00,491 --> 03:27:02,459
Well, that is what she says.

2208
03:27:03,077 --> 03:27:06,547
But I know the real reason...

2209
03:27:08,708 --> 03:27:10,335
it's there that they meet.

2210
03:27:11,377 --> 03:27:12,344
Who?

2211
03:27:14,881 --> 03:27:17,725
She meets with the living-dead.
I saw him.

2212
03:27:19,093 --> 03:27:21,687
But whom? Whom did you see?

2213
03:27:23,139 --> 03:27:24,686
The brave colonel.

2214
03:27:26,351 --> 03:27:27,477
Lacroze?

2215
03:27:29,520 --> 03:27:31,488
The fearless suicide.

2216
03:27:35,860 --> 03:27:37,112
I saw him alive!

2217
03:27:38,488 --> 03:27:39,655
Where?

2218
03:27:39,656 --> 03:27:42,785
Right near here.
I will show you tonight.

2219
03:27:44,744 --> 03:27:46,291
But sit down, sit down.

2220
03:27:47,538 --> 03:27:49,336
Tell me your stories...

2221
03:27:50,124 --> 03:27:51,091
Later.

2222
03:27:53,169 --> 03:27:56,546
Right now I'm going to see Blanche,
and the children.

2223
03:27:56,547 --> 03:27:57,512
I'll be right back.

2224
03:27:57,513 --> 03:27:58,802
That's it, go ahead!

2225
03:27:58,803 --> 03:28:00,097
Go on, go and see them!

2226
03:28:04,764 --> 03:28:05,890
Sebastiao!

2227
03:28:13,898 --> 03:28:14,899
Come.

2228
03:28:24,784 --> 03:28:27,037
You can do me a big favor.

2229
03:28:32,542 --> 03:28:34,167
Take off my boots for me.

2230
03:28:34,168 --> 03:28:35,090
What?

2231
03:28:36,045 --> 03:28:37,092
My boots.

2232
03:30:39,919 --> 03:30:41,842
Good morning.

2233
03:30:42,171 --> 03:30:43,718
I am a friend
of Madame de Montfort's...

2234
03:30:43,719 --> 03:30:46,550
Madame is not here.
She has gone to see her father.

2235
03:30:46,551 --> 03:30:48,098
She will only be back tonight.

2236
03:30:49,053 --> 03:30:50,305
Is he one of the twins?

2237
03:30:50,306 --> 03:30:54,025
Oh, no, this one here, he's mine.
The children are with Madame.

2238
03:30:57,186 --> 03:30:58,353
Thank you.

2239
03:30:58,354 --> 03:31:00,072
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

2240
03:31:16,998 --> 03:31:19,922
Benoit! Benoit!

2241
03:31:22,628 --> 03:31:24,004
Madame? Where is she?

2242
03:31:24,005 --> 03:31:26,006
Sir! She is inside.
I haven't seen her...

2243
03:31:26,007 --> 03:31:26,974
And the children?

2244
03:31:26,975 --> 03:31:29,765
The children stayed with
Madame's father!

2245
03:33:20,705 --> 03:33:24,082
She died in my arms, she never
regained consciousness.

2246
03:33:24,083 --> 03:33:27,053
She hadn't the slightest trace
of burns on her entire body.

2247
03:33:32,133 --> 03:33:37,310
If you ever speak to my wife again.
I'll smash you like a worm.

2248
03:33:51,360 --> 03:33:52,612
Knife-eater!

2249
03:33:55,156 --> 03:33:57,875
Remember Knife-eater,
Alberto de Magalhaesl.

2250
03:33:58,993 --> 03:34:00,495
Remember the assassin!

2251
03:34:03,247 --> 03:34:04,624
Brother...

2252
03:34:14,508 --> 03:34:16,226
All right, brother...

2253
03:34:25,936 --> 03:34:27,233
Thank you, brother.

2254
03:34:28,314 --> 03:34:29,736
You're welcome, brother.

2255
03:34:37,656 --> 03:34:39,784
I'm no brother to any little priest.

2256
03:34:56,175 --> 03:34:58,098
What was this miracle, Father?

2257
03:34:59,929 --> 03:35:02,648
Renounce your vengeance, Duchess.

2258
03:35:04,558 --> 03:35:07,311
It can only lead you into despair.

2259
03:35:09,188 --> 03:35:10,360
Go back to France.

2260
03:35:11,482 --> 03:35:13,029
Forgive and forget.

2261
03:35:14,693 --> 03:35:17,071
I will do what you want, Father Dinis.

2262
03:35:18,239 --> 03:35:21,083
I will go back to France tomorrow.

2263
03:35:21,742 --> 03:35:23,585
But, I do not forgive.

2264
03:35:25,204 --> 03:35:28,708
I do not forget.
I do not renounce.

2265
03:35:58,362 --> 03:36:00,113
Upon my return to Lisbon,

2266
03:36:00,114 --> 03:36:02,082
I paid a visit to my neighbor,
the Viscount of Armagnac,

2267
03:36:02,867 --> 03:36:05,618
in the hopes of distracting myself

2268
03:36:05,619 --> 03:36:08,213
from the obsession
that had tormented me.

2269
03:36:08,497 --> 03:36:11,291
Unfortunately, I was introduced

2270
03:36:11,292 --> 03:36:14,377
to one of his young friends,
Pedro da Silva,

2271
03:36:14,378 --> 03:36:18,303
a Portuguese gentleman
who would reimmerse me, even further...

2272
03:36:31,520 --> 03:36:34,364
I thought you were still in Paris,
my dear Viscount.

2273
03:36:35,399 --> 03:36:38,027
I arrived just two days ago,
Duchess.

2274
03:36:39,653 --> 03:36:40,745
If you please.

2275
03:36:46,452 --> 03:36:49,412
I had intended to go
and pay you my respects today even...

2276
03:36:49,413 --> 03:36:51,131
I shall receive you
with pleasure.

2277
03:36:52,541 --> 03:36:53,417
Sit down.

2278
03:36:53,418 --> 03:36:54,918
Oh, no, I don't have time.

2279
03:36:54,919 --> 03:36:57,172
To make up for it, however,
can I count on you for tea?

2280
03:36:57,173 --> 03:36:58,671
I shall not miss it.

2281
03:36:58,672 --> 03:37:00,970
Your friend will be welcome,
of course.

2282
03:37:05,304 --> 03:37:06,556
Who is she?

2283
03:37:07,806 --> 03:37:12,061
Elisa de Montfort. Duchesse de Cliton.
A neighbor.

2284
03:37:16,857 --> 03:37:19,943
She's lived as a recluse in Montfort
for the past three years.

2285
03:37:19,944 --> 03:37:22,195
She practically never
leaves the castle.

2286
03:37:22,196 --> 03:37:24,369
This is the first time
I've seen her outdoors.

2287
03:37:25,491 --> 03:37:27,075
She doesn't visit anyone.

2288
03:37:27,076 --> 03:37:28,919
She doesn't receive a living soul.

2289
03:37:30,704 --> 03:37:33,457
And she dresses in black...
A romantic?

2290
03:37:35,209 --> 03:37:37,303
I would say more melancholic
than romantic...

2291
03:37:38,128 --> 03:37:39,596
Melancholic? Why?

2292
03:37:41,257 --> 03:37:45,353
The secrets of a proud
and offended woman.

2293
03:37:47,763 --> 03:37:49,722
A fatal passion?

2294
03:37:49,723 --> 03:37:53,142
This is what they say...
In her youth, she had been

2295
03:37:53,143 --> 03:37:55,737
one of the ornaments
in Charles X's salons.

2296
03:37:56,105 --> 03:37:59,154
It was the King himself
who wed her to the Duke of Cliton...

2297
03:38:00,234 --> 03:38:01,736
She is married?

2298
03:38:02,111 --> 03:38:03,203
Oh, not quite.

2299
03:38:04,363 --> 03:38:06,991
The duke soon left
her a widow and in ruin.

2300
03:38:07,992 --> 03:38:11,917
They said that afterwards she found
a mysterious man, a foreigner...

2301
03:38:12,788 --> 03:38:17,589
A shadowy story that ended with
the death of her twin brother in a duel.

2302
03:38:19,503 --> 03:38:24,134
After which, she came here...
Isolated. Alone.

2303
03:38:24,550 --> 03:38:25,972
Always sad.

2304
03:38:29,805 --> 03:38:32,649
Like a character in a novel
by Radcliffe.

2305
03:38:35,644 --> 03:38:37,521
I can't wait to see her again.

2306
03:38:38,814 --> 03:38:40,782
Let's go then, my dear Pedro.

2307
03:38:42,026 --> 03:38:44,199
I wouldn't want you to die of
impatience...

2308
03:39:00,085 --> 03:39:01,052
Thank you.

2309
03:39:05,090 --> 03:39:06,512
No, no, no! No!

2310
03:39:22,316 --> 03:39:23,568
Such rain!

2311
03:39:24,693 --> 03:39:28,243
To think that it was the blue sky
that you had promised me.

2312
03:40:08,362 --> 03:40:09,363
Excuse me.

2313
03:40:55,659 --> 03:40:57,081
Excuse me...

2314
03:41:00,164 --> 03:41:01,837
I'll go see what is going on.

2315
03:41:20,559 --> 03:41:21,902
Excuse me...

2316
03:41:24,813 --> 03:41:26,315
I'm sorry.

2317
03:41:27,441 --> 03:41:29,239
I don't feel very well.

2318
03:41:30,194 --> 03:41:32,037
I'm going to have to leave you.

2319
03:42:10,400 --> 03:42:11,652
We must leave.

2320
03:42:21,995 --> 03:42:22,666
Let's go?

2321
03:42:26,750 --> 03:42:28,218
I'll explain later.

2322
03:42:57,906 --> 03:42:59,448
Don't deny it.

2323
03:42:59,449 --> 03:43:03,035
I'm sure she found me provincial,
awkward, spiritless...

2324
03:43:03,036 --> 03:43:04,954
On the contrary, my dear Pedro.

2325
03:43:04,955 --> 03:43:07,540
I am convinced that you interest
and intrigue her.

2326
03:43:07,541 --> 03:43:08,836
The looks she gave you

2327
03:43:08,837 --> 03:43:10,300
while you weren't looking...
They don't deceive!

2328
03:43:10,301 --> 03:43:11,045
Come in.

2329
03:43:13,046 --> 03:43:15,298
She merely addressed
a single word toward me.

2330
03:43:15,299 --> 03:43:17,301
Exactly. To provoke you.

2331
03:43:18,093 --> 03:43:20,812
There is nothing like the feigned
indifference

2332
03:43:21,096 --> 03:43:23,394
of a woman to excite a man's desire.

2333
03:43:27,436 --> 03:43:32,784
I see your eyes in the warm twilight...

2334
03:43:33,233 --> 03:43:34,610
Shit...

2335
03:43:37,446 --> 03:43:44,876
I see...
I see your eyes in the twilight warm.

2336
03:43:45,329 --> 03:43:46,421
Shit...

2337
03:43:51,835 --> 03:43:54,463
For a week,
it rained constantly.

2338
03:43:54,838 --> 03:43:59,685
And no news of the Duchess of Cliton,
although I thought of her day and night...

2339
03:44:00,469 --> 03:44:03,598
Fallen into oblivion... No, No!

2340
03:44:11,355 --> 03:44:13,107
Policarpo, help me.

2341
03:44:29,790 --> 03:44:35,342
I saw your eyes in the cold twilight.
It was in a sad and morbid castle.

2342
03:44:37,798 --> 03:44:39,548
At the top of a staircase,

2343
03:44:39,549 --> 03:44:41,643
one day when forgetfulness
had taken everything away

2344
03:44:42,052 --> 03:44:43,520
except for your stern gaze...

2345
03:44:45,263 --> 03:44:46,810
But what a charming thing,

2346
03:44:47,182 --> 03:44:51,686
seeing your limpid eyes
in the castle night.

2347
03:44:51,687 --> 03:44:57,149
Our livid bed, I am wounded
by the menacing stare

2348
03:44:57,150 --> 03:45:00,027
of the sad and watchful pupils
in your eyes?

2349
03:45:00,028 --> 03:45:04,532
I suddenly see the solitary figure of a
lunar and yawning woman,

2350
03:45:04,533 --> 03:45:09,289
who rises, so dignified,
from the waters.

2351
03:45:10,330 --> 03:45:13,049
I spent hours there,
hoping to see her leave,

2352
03:45:13,834 --> 03:45:16,836
not knowing if I'd have the courage
to approach her...

2353
03:45:16,837 --> 03:45:19,681
And without daring to knock on that door...

2354
03:45:20,465 --> 03:45:22,092
I finally couldn't resist,

2355
03:45:22,551 --> 03:45:26,055
I brought her the sonnet
I had decided not to show her.

2356
03:45:28,682 --> 03:45:33,153
That's what youth is all about.
Naivete and arrogance.

2357
03:45:50,871 --> 03:45:53,624
She returned it to me the same day,
with a short note...

2358
03:45:54,082 --> 03:45:56,083
I am returning your verses to you.

2359
03:45:56,084 --> 03:45:58,085
Give them to someone your own age

2360
03:45:58,086 --> 03:46:00,009
who deserves them much more than I.

2361
03:46:00,010 --> 03:46:03,132
It would be unusual for any man of mine

2362
03:46:03,133 --> 03:46:05,807
to have a pure enough
soul to understand them.

2363
03:46:06,219 --> 03:46:08,642
The pain, the humiliation,
was unbearable...

2364
03:46:09,222 --> 03:46:10,222
Come in!

2365
03:46:10,223 --> 03:46:12,817
I wanted to die, to run away,
to disappear forever...

2366
03:46:13,894 --> 03:46:15,362
Madame de Montfort.

2367
03:46:18,148 --> 03:46:20,947
Forgive me! I am unforgivable.

2368
03:46:21,735 --> 03:46:25,490
I didn't want to offend you,
I swear. Pardon me.

2369
03:46:26,281 --> 03:46:29,410
How could I do that to you?
Tell me you'll forgive me.

2370
03:46:30,368 --> 03:46:31,460
Forgive you?

2371
03:46:32,913 --> 03:46:35,873
It is I who should be
asking forgiveness from you!

2372
03:46:35,874 --> 03:46:37,249
To think that I dared

2373
03:46:37,250 --> 03:46:38,793
I didn't want to, believe me...

2374
03:46:38,794 --> 03:46:39,670
I shouldn't have done it!

2375
03:46:39,671 --> 03:46:43,094
No, no! It's me alone!
It is I who am unforgivable!

2376
03:46:43,632 --> 03:46:45,634
Don't say that, I beg you!

2377
03:46:46,885 --> 03:46:48,432
But you are soaked!

2378
03:46:49,012 --> 03:46:53,813
How long have you been in the rain?
Come in, sit down, please.

2379
03:46:54,643 --> 03:46:55,986
No, I can't.

2380
03:46:57,521 --> 03:47:00,695
So, it's here that you write your poems?

2381
03:47:03,902 --> 03:47:05,279
How charming...

2382
03:47:08,156 --> 03:47:09,578
What is that?

2383
03:47:10,784 --> 03:47:12,661
A gift from my mother.

2384
03:47:13,453 --> 03:47:14,545
It's pretty.

2385
03:47:17,040 --> 03:47:18,462
Wait! I have an idea!

2386
03:47:19,543 --> 03:47:21,386
Come to the castle this evening.

2387
03:47:21,670 --> 03:47:25,095
At whatever time you want.
I will be waiting for you.

2388
03:47:25,924 --> 03:47:28,222
I'll explain everything, you'll see...

2389
03:47:28,844 --> 03:47:30,471
And bring the poem.

2390
03:47:30,804 --> 03:47:33,683
I beg you. Bring it to me.

2391
03:47:34,558 --> 03:47:36,686
To prove to me that you forgive me...

2392
03:47:42,482 --> 03:47:43,950
Mister da Silva has arrived.

2393
03:47:43,951 --> 03:47:45,034
Thank you.

2394
03:47:46,069 --> 03:47:47,321
I must leave.

2395
03:47:48,238 --> 03:47:49,831
He thinks I am at Angouleme.

2396
03:47:50,824 --> 03:47:52,201
Go out through there.

2397
03:48:33,408 --> 03:48:35,627
I saw you outside, in the rain

2398
03:48:36,369 --> 03:48:38,963
and I burned
with the desire to call you,

2399
03:48:39,623 --> 03:48:42,752
to go find you,
to shelter you in my arms...

2400
03:48:46,922 --> 03:48:48,595
Why didn't you do it?

2401
03:48:49,758 --> 03:48:51,305
Why didn't you call me?

2402
03:48:52,802 --> 03:48:55,555
Because I didn't know
if I had the right...

2403
03:48:57,432 --> 03:48:58,934
Who would refuse it?

2404
03:49:00,268 --> 03:49:02,737
You are free, Elisa.
As free as I am.

2405
03:49:03,063 --> 03:49:06,067
No, Pedro, I'm not free.

2406
03:49:07,776 --> 03:49:11,280
I'm a prisoner of the scruples
of my conscience

2407
03:49:12,697 --> 03:49:14,825
and the stain I have on my heart.

2408
03:49:16,660 --> 03:49:18,708
I don't have the right to be yours.

2409
03:49:20,705 --> 03:49:23,549
I don't understand you.
You talk in riddles.

2410
03:49:24,668 --> 03:49:25,840
You're so young!

2411
03:49:27,212 --> 03:49:29,180
Your verses are so innocent,

2412
03:49:29,798 --> 03:49:31,971
so clear, so pure...

2413
03:49:34,094 --> 03:49:35,812
They made me feel so bad...

2414
03:49:36,846 --> 03:49:38,848
Bad? Why?

2415
03:49:40,433 --> 03:49:42,356
They only meant well...

2416
03:49:42,936 --> 03:49:46,986
They took me back to a time
when I was also pure,

2417
03:49:47,691 --> 03:49:48,988
good and happy...

2418
03:49:52,445 --> 03:49:56,871
Before they made me
unhappy and nasty.

2419
03:49:58,493 --> 03:50:00,086
Elisa! Not nasty!

2420
03:50:01,079 --> 03:50:03,831
One could make you sad.
But not nasty!

2421
03:50:03,832 --> 03:50:07,553
My poor Pedro, if you knew!

2422
03:50:09,879 --> 03:50:12,589
If you knew the desires of death,

2423
03:50:12,590 --> 03:50:15,719
the thirst for blood that fill me
for nights on end!

2424
03:50:17,721 --> 03:50:20,816
The wishes for vengeance
that suffocate my heart

2425
03:50:21,141 --> 03:50:23,851
to the point of preventing it from
beating,

2426
03:50:23,852 --> 03:50:26,895
Or allowing myself to be
paralyzed for days...

2427
03:50:26,896 --> 03:50:30,241
In the darkest despair
and impotent rage...

2428
03:50:33,903 --> 03:50:36,827
That is how I have lived
for years, Pedro.

2429
03:50:38,241 --> 03:50:42,087
Since the day they robbed me
of my honor,

2430
03:50:42,746 --> 03:50:44,999
and of the life of my only brother.

2431
03:50:47,876 --> 03:50:48,718
This man...

2432
03:50:50,128 --> 03:50:51,380
The foreigner?

2433
03:50:53,923 --> 03:50:56,927
They spoke to you about him!
They told you...

2434
03:50:57,802 --> 03:50:58,894
Vaguely.

2435
03:50:59,387 --> 03:51:01,890
They told you he is Portuguese,
like you?

2436
03:51:02,766 --> 03:51:03,608
No!

2437
03:51:06,519 --> 03:51:08,021
What is his name?

2438
03:51:08,938 --> 03:51:10,531
He has had many names.

2439
03:51:11,316 --> 03:51:14,026
Right now, he calls himself
Alberto de Magalhaes.

2440
03:51:14,027 --> 03:51:15,778
Despite my insistence,

2441
03:51:15,779 --> 03:51:18,405
Elisa categorically refused
to give any more details

2442
03:51:18,406 --> 03:51:21,200
about the shadowy story that
had destroyed her life,

2443
03:51:21,201 --> 03:51:23,035
Yet as the night went on,

2444
03:51:23,036 --> 03:51:26,955
it became ever clearer to me that
that man's existence

2445
03:51:26,956 --> 03:51:29,291
was the only obstacle
to our happiness...

2446
03:51:29,292 --> 03:51:31,966
When the day came,
my decision had been made,

2447
03:51:32,796 --> 03:51:36,215
I would return to Lisbon to avenge
the honor of the Duchess of Cliton

2448
03:51:36,216 --> 03:51:38,344
and the death of her only brother...

2449
03:51:39,427 --> 03:51:42,429
Back at the estate, a letter from
Portugal awaited me,

2450
03:51:42,430 --> 03:51:44,899
announcing the death of my mother,

2451
03:51:45,600 --> 03:51:49,355
victim of the cholera epidemic that
had spread throughout the country.

2452
03:51:50,230 --> 03:51:54,441
By the cruel irony of fortune,
my decision to return to Lisbon

2453
03:51:54,442 --> 03:51:57,036
was now painfully justified.

2454
03:52:16,589 --> 03:52:17,681
Yes?

2455
03:52:17,966 --> 03:52:20,342
There is a gentlemen here
with a foreign air

2456
03:52:20,343 --> 03:52:23,345
and I told him you wouldn't
receive anyone, but he insisted.

2457
03:52:23,346 --> 03:52:27,226
He says he is an emissary
on behalf of Artur de Montfort.

2458
03:52:27,600 --> 03:52:29,193
He wrote his name here...

2459
03:52:34,107 --> 03:52:36,030
What kind of bad joke is this?

2460
03:52:47,537 --> 03:52:50,962
Is your Excellency the emissary
of Artur de Montfort?

2461
03:52:52,125 --> 03:52:53,217
I am!

2462
03:52:54,544 --> 03:52:56,763
Artur de Montfort!!

2463
03:52:57,130 --> 03:52:58,723
He died nine years ago!

2464
03:52:59,507 --> 03:53:00,724
Indeed!

2465
03:53:02,886 --> 03:53:05,981
Then I gather your Excellency
has come from the other world!

2466
03:53:07,056 --> 03:53:08,979
Are things well around there?

2467
03:53:11,561 --> 03:53:14,064
There the murderers rest...

2468
03:53:15,273 --> 03:53:18,152
Here, the murderers
await their hour...

2469
03:53:21,070 --> 03:53:25,871
I came precisely to demand
that the murderer of Artur de Montfort

2470
03:53:26,534 --> 03:53:29,913
answers me on the field of honor,
with weapons in hand.

2471
03:53:32,040 --> 03:53:33,041
Demand!

2472
03:53:39,422 --> 03:53:40,674
With what right?

2473
03:53:45,428 --> 03:53:47,977
You probably never knew poor Artur.

2474
03:53:51,226 --> 03:53:55,072
You couldn't have been more than ten
years old when he left us...

2475
03:53:58,066 --> 03:53:59,909
But perhaps you know his sister,

2476
03:54:01,861 --> 03:54:03,363
Elisa de Montfort,

2477
03:54:06,324 --> 03:54:07,997
the Duchess of Cliton...

2478
03:54:11,955 --> 03:54:13,081
Am I mistaken?

2479
03:54:14,207 --> 03:54:18,587
I have no intention of talking
about my personal acquaintances...

2480
03:54:20,588 --> 03:54:22,590
I already told you why I have come.

2481
03:54:23,716 --> 03:54:25,968
I leave the choice of arms up to you...

2482
03:54:25,969 --> 03:54:27,095
And I await your response.

2483
03:54:28,263 --> 03:54:29,014
Very well!

2484
03:54:31,849 --> 03:54:33,396
If you insist!

2485
03:54:36,729 --> 03:54:39,232
I'm just going to send you
my witnesses.

2486
03:54:41,109 --> 03:54:44,534
That is, if you'd be so kind
as to give me your address!

2487
03:54:46,281 --> 03:54:49,000
It's written on the card
I sent to you...

2488
03:54:51,536 --> 03:54:56,918
The Isidro, an excellent hotel!
A wise choice...

2489
03:55:19,397 --> 03:55:20,444
Come here!

2490
03:58:39,347 --> 03:58:40,439
Arms!

2491
03:58:41,474 --> 03:58:43,897
Considering that neither of us
had yet been wounded,

2492
03:58:43,898 --> 03:58:46,988
upon my insistence and despite
Alberto 's resistance,

2493
03:58:47,271 --> 03:58:50,115
it was decided to continue
our duel with pistols...

2494
03:59:19,387 --> 03:59:20,934
Unfortunately, my dear friend,

2495
03:59:23,558 --> 03:59:26,402
one cannot duck bullets
the way one ducks a sword.

2496
03:59:31,899 --> 03:59:34,322
One of us will end up
staying here forever.

2497
03:59:36,654 --> 03:59:38,201
Isn't that the idea?

2498
03:59:43,411 --> 03:59:44,754
In theory, yes!

2499
03:59:47,039 --> 03:59:51,761
And given that I can't dissuade you
to put a stop to this nonsense,

2500
03:59:54,964 --> 03:59:56,798
I find myself forced to suggest

2501
03:59:56,799 --> 03:59:58,972
that we have other means
placed at our disposal.

2502
03:59:59,844 --> 04:00:01,141
I don't understand.

2503
04:00:02,680 --> 04:00:03,897
You will understand...

2504
04:00:07,059 --> 04:00:09,728
I'm talking about where
I should give the money

2505
04:00:09,729 --> 04:00:11,447
that Father Dinis left me
to administer on your behalf.

2506
04:00:13,816 --> 04:00:15,534
On my behalf?

2507
04:00:17,695 --> 04:00:19,493
Father Dinis... You knew him?

2508
04:00:21,741 --> 04:00:23,493
Strange, some things in life...

2509
04:00:25,077 --> 04:00:26,329
I knew Father Dinis.

2510
04:00:28,706 --> 04:00:30,800
And I knew you, Don Pedro.

2511
04:00:33,461 --> 04:00:35,509
I practically saw you being born...

2512
04:00:46,724 --> 04:00:48,226
I fear my dear gentlemen...

2513
04:00:51,354 --> 04:00:55,109
I feel we must change
the agenda...

2514
04:00:58,611 --> 04:01:01,535
I've just spoken to
my valiant opponent,

2515
04:01:04,492 --> 04:01:05,209
and told him some things

2516
04:01:06,661 --> 04:01:11,508
that have changed his mind
about continuing this duel.

2517
04:01:13,125 --> 04:01:17,926
If he agrees, I propose to postpone
this duel until a later date.

2518
04:01:26,931 --> 04:01:29,025
If it's not considered dishonorable
on my part...

2519
04:01:31,060 --> 04:01:33,279
No. Not at all...

2520
04:01:33,813 --> 04:01:35,281
isn't that true, gentlemen?

2521
04:01:48,953 --> 04:01:50,671
Come out from there, Don Pedro.

2522
04:01:51,539 --> 04:01:53,712
Suddenly, I felt lost.

2523
04:01:54,333 --> 04:01:57,507
I was once again the Joao
of Father Dinis's school,

2524
04:01:57,795 --> 04:02:00,639
before I ever found my mother
or knew my name, or my history.

2525
04:02:01,799 --> 04:02:04,973
A mere puppet, manipulated
by invisible hands

2526
04:02:05,302 --> 04:02:07,646
at the mercy of some other will...

2527
04:02:08,472 --> 04:02:12,602
I didn't know what to do,
or what decision to make.

2528
04:02:58,397 --> 04:03:01,649
Everything he had told me was more
than convincing,

2529
04:03:01,650 --> 04:03:04,779
as it corresponded point by point to
what I already knew

2530
04:03:05,112 --> 04:03:08,207
from Father Dinis' intervention
to save my life

2531
04:03:08,532 --> 04:03:11,159
to the role played by Alberto himself

2532
04:03:11,160 --> 04:03:15,131
in defending the reputation
of my mother against her slanderers...

2533
04:03:16,123 --> 04:03:19,667
But despite my insistence,
he refused to reveal the origin

2534
04:03:19,668 --> 04:03:23,923
of the fortune he administered on my
behalf at the request of Father Dinis.

2535
04:03:31,138 --> 04:03:34,563
I met Elisa de Montfort, in Paris,

2536
04:03:37,520 --> 04:03:41,400
at a time when nothing could
make me resist satisfying my whims.

2537
04:03:45,653 --> 04:03:49,408
She had just lost the husband who
had decimated her fortune.

2538
04:03:50,199 --> 04:03:52,826
She was, in those days,
a dangerous woman

2539
04:03:52,827 --> 04:03:55,954
who acted like she wanted
to avenge herself in life,

2540
04:03:55,955 --> 04:03:59,380
and would use romance to crush
the self-esteem of several men

2541
04:04:00,084 --> 04:04:01,802
and several women.

2542
04:04:02,169 --> 04:04:04,763
It was said she had provoked six duels.

2543
04:04:05,548 --> 04:04:09,303
To me at the time, she was
an irresistible challenge...

2544
04:04:10,803 --> 04:04:15,684
It started as a frivolous game,
and ended as a sordid bourgeois drama...

2545
04:04:47,089 --> 04:04:48,636
You wanted to see me?

2546
04:04:49,383 --> 04:04:51,135
I am at your disposal.

2547
04:04:51,719 --> 04:04:55,519
Just now, I heard you say that
every man has his price.

2548
04:04:56,098 --> 04:04:57,600
Do you truly believe that?

2549
04:04:58,225 --> 04:04:59,693
Yes, I believe it.

2550
04:05:00,603 --> 04:05:02,150
That makes you laugh.

2551
04:05:02,730 --> 04:05:06,232
Bonaparte thought the same thing
and that didn't go too well for him.

2552
04:05:06,233 --> 04:05:07,655
I wasn't talking about politics.

2553
04:05:07,656 --> 04:05:08,735
Nor of war.

2554
04:05:08,736 --> 04:05:10,111
Even less.

2555
04:05:10,112 --> 04:05:11,284
So, what were you talking about?

2556
04:05:11,989 --> 04:05:13,865
I was talking about business.

2557
04:05:13,866 --> 04:05:15,083
And of love.

2558
04:05:15,367 --> 04:05:17,410
Yes...of love.

2559
04:05:17,411 --> 04:05:19,996
You mean to say that
I also have a price?

2560
04:05:19,997 --> 04:05:21,340
Yes Madame.

2561
04:05:21,916 --> 04:05:23,293
How much?

2562
04:05:23,626 --> 04:05:25,001
Fifty thousand.

2563
04:05:25,002 --> 04:05:28,381
Is that all?
In that case, for only one day...

2564
04:05:29,757 --> 04:05:31,174
One night.

2565
04:05:31,175 --> 04:05:32,392
One hundred thousand.

2566
04:05:32,393 --> 04:05:33,681
Eighty.

2567
04:05:34,386 --> 04:05:35,558
Done!

2568
04:05:36,138 --> 04:05:38,812
I will bring the contract
this afternoon.

2569
04:05:39,183 --> 04:05:42,268
Even now, I still ask myself
if she accepted the challenge

2570
04:05:42,269 --> 04:05:44,562
out of a real passion
for the game,

2571
04:05:44,563 --> 04:05:46,565
or merely for the love of money.

2572
04:05:48,150 --> 04:05:51,780
I had the contract written up
and sent it to her.

2573
04:05:53,656 --> 04:05:56,125
She came that same night to my hotel...

2574
04:06:12,591 --> 04:06:14,013
If you please, Madame.

2575
04:06:23,060 --> 04:06:24,937
The contract. Signed.

2576
04:07:33,505 --> 04:07:36,007
She returned the signed contract
to me,

2577
04:07:36,008 --> 04:07:38,885
and left the next morning
with the 80 thousand francs

2578
04:07:38,886 --> 04:07:40,888
which I had most discreetly
placed in her bag.

2579
04:07:43,432 --> 04:07:44,979
The game should have ended there.

2580
04:07:48,771 --> 04:07:50,899
But she returned the next night,

2581
04:07:53,525 --> 04:07:55,118
and the one after that,

2582
04:07:55,903 --> 04:07:57,371
and the one after that...

2583
04:08:00,199 --> 04:08:04,420
After a week she wanted
to give me my money back.

2584
04:08:05,954 --> 04:08:08,831
For her it was no longer a game,

2585
04:08:08,832 --> 04:08:11,961
It became serious... I refused.

2586
04:08:14,171 --> 04:08:15,172
At that time,

2587
04:08:17,049 --> 04:08:19,893
the most serious thing
was precisely the game...

2588
04:08:21,804 --> 04:08:23,647
I changed hotels, she found me.

2589
04:08:24,848 --> 04:08:27,809
I gave orders for her not to be
allowed to enter,

2590
04:08:27,810 --> 04:08:30,063
and she left me the 80 thousand francs
at the reception desk,

2591
04:08:30,064 --> 04:08:34,158
with a note I never read.
I sent them back and moved again,

2592
04:08:35,567 --> 04:08:38,946
this time to an obscure inn
in a populated neighborhood.

2593
04:08:43,325 --> 04:08:44,872
Stop, please!

2594
04:08:53,961 --> 04:08:55,554
I'll walk from here.

2595
04:09:43,135 --> 04:09:46,435
In desperation,
she sent her twin brother,

2596
04:09:48,056 --> 04:09:49,433
Artur de Montfort,

2597
04:09:50,267 --> 04:09:52,810
And since then, she regularly
sends someone

2598
04:09:52,811 --> 04:09:55,897
no matter where I am,
with the mission of her vengeance.

2599
04:09:55,898 --> 04:09:59,368
The last time, she came herself
I guess that with time,

2600
04:09:59,651 --> 04:10:02,871
the thirst for vengeance
became her only reason to live...

2601
04:10:06,283 --> 04:10:09,285
At her grave, I couldn't even
cry for my mother,

2602
04:10:09,286 --> 04:10:11,454
whom I had seen so little
while she lived,

2603
04:10:11,455 --> 04:10:14,916
Angela de Lima,
Countess of Santa Barbara,

2604
04:10:14,917 --> 04:10:19,086
rested in an anonymous grave,
together with scores of wretches

2605
04:10:19,087 --> 04:10:21,636
victims like herself, of the cholera
epidemic...

2606
04:10:22,174 --> 04:10:23,925
Is someone there?

2607
04:10:23,926 --> 04:10:26,224
Her poor name was not anywhere
to be seen.

2608
04:10:28,472 --> 04:10:29,644
Can I help you?

2609
04:10:31,058 --> 04:10:32,310
Oh, sir, please...

2610
04:10:39,107 --> 04:10:42,077
Are we in the eastern part
of the cemetery?

2611
04:10:43,445 --> 04:10:47,075
Yes...We're in the right place...
it's here...

2612
04:10:47,950 --> 04:10:49,202
Thank you very much.

2613
04:10:50,118 --> 04:10:53,292
I'm looking for the mausoleum
where my daughter is...

2614
04:10:55,457 --> 04:10:56,674
Mausoleum?

2615
04:10:57,459 --> 04:11:01,009
My friends assure me it is monumental.

2616
04:11:01,880 --> 04:11:05,305
My friends say it is the most beautiful
in the entire cemetery...

2617
04:11:07,135 --> 04:11:08,387
I'm unable to see it.

2618
04:11:09,471 --> 04:11:13,474
With the last money left from
my fortune,

2619
04:11:13,475 --> 04:11:16,604
I had this mausoleum built...

2620
04:11:17,479 --> 04:11:20,904
Would you be so kind
as to describe it to me?

2621
04:11:21,483 --> 04:11:23,030
It's beautiful, isn't it?

2622
04:11:25,112 --> 04:11:27,285
I don't know if I would be able...

2623
04:11:29,366 --> 04:11:33,291
I am the Marquis of Montezelos.
What is your name?

2624
04:11:36,790 --> 04:11:39,213
I am a simple student, Marquis...

2625
04:11:40,377 --> 04:11:43,129
my mother died and
I came to visit her...

2626
04:11:43,130 --> 04:11:46,225
So your mother is also
in a mausoleum, right?

2627
04:11:47,509 --> 04:11:51,059
No, Marquis, my mother is in
a common pauper's grave...

2628
04:11:52,180 --> 04:11:53,477
Poor woman.

2629
04:11:55,058 --> 04:11:57,527
Had I mentioned to you that
I was a bad father?

2630
04:11:58,270 --> 04:11:59,613
No. I hadn't.

2631
04:12:00,939 --> 04:12:06,537
This head of mine,
and now, as you see I am a beggar,

2632
04:12:08,155 --> 04:12:11,375
and now that we're having
this conversation,

2633
04:12:11,783 --> 04:12:14,411
would you happen to have a small coin,
for the love of God?

2634
04:12:16,663 --> 04:12:17,789
Of course...

2635
04:12:19,958 --> 04:12:21,210
Thank you very much...

2636
04:12:21,211 --> 04:12:23,962
Marquis, your friends
are waiting for you...

2637
04:12:28,175 --> 04:12:29,051
Poor Marquis.

2638
04:12:31,553 --> 04:12:33,304
He's lost his mind...

2639
04:12:33,305 --> 04:12:34,602
The accident...

2640
04:12:35,182 --> 04:12:36,557
He had an accident?

2641
04:12:36,558 --> 04:12:40,404
It wasn't an accident...
more of a failed suicide attempt...

2642
04:12:42,064 --> 04:12:43,782
His daughter's dishonor...

2643
04:12:45,067 --> 04:12:50,665
What to us are the things of life,
are enormous tragedies to the nobility...

2644
04:12:53,075 --> 04:12:55,624
He fired the shot as they left the Mass.

2645
04:12:57,829 --> 04:13:00,207
He didn't kill himself,
but he was blinded.

2646
04:13:00,957 --> 04:13:05,838
He wasted away the fortune
and people were moved by this sadness.

2647
04:13:07,839 --> 04:13:11,810
They were moved by a beggar Marquis
and still give him a lot of money.

2648
04:13:12,969 --> 04:13:15,017
That's the blessing of beggars...

2649
04:13:17,099 --> 04:13:18,225
Even in disgrace,

2650
04:13:18,600 --> 04:13:20,227
the nobles are favored.

2651
04:13:22,104 --> 04:13:23,321
And the mausoleum?

2652
04:13:23,605 --> 04:13:27,030
The mausoleum doesn't exist.
It was an invention of the Marquis...

2653
04:13:29,236 --> 04:13:30,738
Where are you, Manuel?

2654
04:13:31,238 --> 04:13:33,366
I'm here, Marquis.

2655
04:13:34,741 --> 04:13:36,539
I'll be right there!

2656
04:13:37,369 --> 04:13:39,087
Please excuse me...

2657
04:14:37,179 --> 04:14:41,309
I've heard that Alberto de Magalhaes
has enjoyed excellent health.

2658
04:14:43,477 --> 04:14:45,696
You lacked courage my dear.

2659
04:14:47,439 --> 04:14:50,318
And I, whose heart you once possessed...

2660
04:15:04,581 --> 04:15:06,504
My life no longer made any sense.

2661
04:15:07,209 --> 04:15:11,635
My only thought was to disappear,
to lose myself quickly, completely,

2662
04:15:11,963 --> 04:15:13,510
and without a trace...

2663
04:15:16,009 --> 04:15:19,388
I caught the first boat I found,
bound for Tangiers,

2664
04:15:20,347 --> 04:15:23,977
which allowed me to board for the coins
I still had in my pocket...

2665
04:15:26,853 --> 04:15:29,104
One soon discovers
that it is not difficult

2666
04:15:29,105 --> 04:15:30,982
to disappear from the eyes of others,

2667
04:15:31,358 --> 04:15:34,328
but that our own eyes follow us
wherever we go.

2668
04:15:37,155 --> 04:15:41,001
I continued to travel randomly,
aimlessly, to lose myself

2669
04:15:42,911 --> 04:15:44,128
I don't know how,

2670
04:15:44,412 --> 04:15:46,255
but the representatives
of Alberto Magalhaes

2671
04:15:46,256 --> 04:15:47,873
never lost my trail

2672
04:15:47,874 --> 04:15:51,219
and I continued to regularly receive
the money intended for me.

2673
04:15:54,422 --> 04:15:56,891
My footsteps have finally led me here.

2674
04:15:58,510 --> 04:16:00,512
I don't think I can go any further.

2675
04:16:01,638 --> 04:16:04,312
My condition doesn't allow me
many illusions.

2676
04:16:05,433 --> 04:16:06,517
Excuse me,

2677
04:16:06,518 --> 04:16:10,944
could you kindly direct me to an inn
that is far from the center of town?

2678
04:16:11,815 --> 04:16:16,992
That won't be easy.
Most of our inns are right in the center.

2679
04:16:19,281 --> 04:16:22,330
In that case, I'll have to settle
for the closest.

2680
04:16:44,055 --> 04:16:46,023
This is the closest.

2681
04:16:47,309 --> 04:16:48,356
Thank you.

2682
04:18:55,186 --> 04:18:58,565
I was fifteen years old
and I didn't know who I was at all...

2683
04:19:04,863 --> 04:19:08,743
Sometimes, the others would ask me
if I was Father Dinis' son...

2684
04:19:11,369 --> 04:19:13,588
I didn't know how to answer them.

2685
04:19:17,625 --> 04:19:19,548
They all had surnames...

2686
04:19:21,463 --> 04:19:25,764
Four, five, even more...

2687
04:19:30,221 --> 04:19:31,768
I was just "Joao."

2688
04:19:39,397 --> 04:19:40,865
Unlike the others,

2689
04:19:45,111 --> 04:19:50,163
I went on no outings,

2690
04:19:51,618 --> 04:19:55,088
had no holidays, received no presents.

2691
04:20:06,758 --> 04:20:10,979
I don't know how long had passed
between the time I lost consciousness...

2692
04:20:13,306 --> 04:20:16,276
and the moment
I opened my eyes again...

2693
04:20:21,147 --> 04:20:23,115
I thought I had dreamt it all.

2694
04:20:43,795 --> 04:20:51,475
Dona Antonia...

2695
04:20:58,810 --> 04:21:00,278
Help him lie down.

2696
04:21:08,361 --> 04:21:09,908
Father Dinis!

2697
04:21:14,200 --> 04:21:15,292
He is cold.

2698
04:21:16,995 --> 04:21:21,717
We'd better find a doctor!
I'll order the coach to be readied.
