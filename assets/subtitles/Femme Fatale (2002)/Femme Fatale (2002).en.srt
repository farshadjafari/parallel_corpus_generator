1
00:00:09,484 --> 00:00:11,687
For once I believe you,
because you're just rotten enough.

2
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:15,531
- We're both rotten.
- And you are a little more rotten.

3
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:17,992
You got me to take care
of your husband for you...

4
00:00:18,124 --> 00:00:20,644
...and you get security to take care
of Lola, maybe take care of me too.

5
00:00:21,324 --> 00:00:23,844
And somebody else would have come
along to take care of the kidy for you.

6
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:25,985
That's the way you operated, baby.

7
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:28,971
Suppose it is? It's what you've got
cooked up for tonight any better?

8
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:33,128
I don't like that music anymore.

9
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:36,008
You mind if I close the window?

10
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:56,327
You can do better than that,
can't you baby?

11
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:58,563
Better try it again.

12
00:01:01,484 --> 00:01:03,688
Maybe if I come a little closer?

13
00:01:13,643 --> 00:01:16,491
How's this?
Think you can do it now?

14
00:01:24,843 --> 00:01:26,730
Why didn't you shoot again, baby?

15
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,691
Don't tell me it's because you've been
in love with me all this time.

16
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,527
No. I never loved you Walter,
not you or anybody else.

17
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:42,731
I'm rotten to the heart,
I used you just as you said.

18
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,287
That's all you ever meant to me...

19
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:50,087
...until a minute ago.
- What the fuck are you doing?

20
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:56,490
Do you know what time it is?

21
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:04,803
Listen up.

22
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:07,371
At twenty two hundred...

23
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:10,244
...Wetsuit's down the hole
when the snake hits the carpet.

24
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,810
Security lifts the key.

25
00:02:13,163 --> 00:02:15,051
I terminate the torpedoes.

26
00:02:15,723 --> 00:02:17,927
You charm the Snake
into the stall.

27
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:20,163
Bait and switch.

28
00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:22,727
At twenty two twenty...

29
00:02:23,403 --> 00:02:25,290
Wetsuit turns
out the lights.

30
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:27,208
Glasses on.

31
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:29,025
I bag the snake.

32
00:02:29,163 --> 00:02:31,367
Key in the bag.
Bag to the boat.

33
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:36,491
No radio unless absolutely necessary.

34
00:02:37,644 --> 00:02:39,848
Code Red.
5 minutes to blackout.

35
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:42,411
Drop everything.
Walk away.

36
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:45,924
If the cops get you,
tell them the truth.

37
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:48,804
You know no one.

38
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:51,368
Got it?

39
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:53,607
Got it?

40
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:00,324
You have your passport?

41
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:08,011
The plane leaves tomorrow
at 0 seven hundred.

42
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:13,444
And remember,
no names and no guns!

43
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:21,924
Are you high?

44
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:27,371
Then stop dreaming, bitch.

45
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:30,243
This isn't a game tonight.
People can die.

46
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:35,043
Now get moving.

47
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:50,403
You forget something?

48
00:04:21,643 --> 00:04:24,490
Stepping onto the red carpet here is
Régis Wargnier...

49
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:26,948
...the director of "East West"...

50
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:29,288
present tonight for
a special screening of his film...

51
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,847
...he is accompanied by
the producer Yves Marmion.

52
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:34,090
And the splendid actress
Sandrine Bonnaire.

53
00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:36,004
On his right is Veronica...

54
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:39,211
...who is wearing an amazing top
in shape of a serpent.

55
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:43,047
It was especially designed
by Elli Medeiros.

56
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:48,393
And the reason why those young brawny
people in tuxedos are surrounding...

57
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:51,687
...the super model is that this piece
of jewelry is priceless.

58
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:54,564
Now, the people from Chopard
are telling me that this top...

59
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:57,128
...is actually adorned with
500 diamonds for...

60
00:04:57,483 --> 00:05:00,647
...a total weight of 385 carats...
- Gee! That's worth a small fortune.

61
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:04,804
With an estimated value
of over 10 million dollars.

62
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:07,367
Check out that ass, man!

63
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:16,163
Look at those boobs!

64
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:18,411
Worth ten million dollars!

65
00:05:48,684 --> 00:05:52,164
Check out the way that slut moves,
fuck, what is she on?

66
00:05:56,364 --> 00:06:00,804
- I can't believe you did that!
- I'm sorry, I was looking at the girl.

67
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:03,051
Yeah, you were looking,
but you ruined my pants!

68
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:05,825
- What am I supposed to do now?
- Ok, I'll fix it.

69
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,851
You'd better fucking
clean it up, man!

70
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:46,247
Regis, we must go,
they're waiting for us.

71
00:07:48,203 --> 00:07:52,327
I just gotta go to the bathroom.
You know how it is for girls.

72
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:53,930
You come back?

73
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:55,527
One minute.

74
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:07,364
- At last!
- Here they are.

75
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:11,204
Okay, great. But look what you did
to my pants!

76
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,970
- I've got just the stuff to fix that.
- Then move your ass!

77
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:09,924
I've gotta piss too,
I'll be right back.

78
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:39,363
Give me the key!

79
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,330
Got a light?

80
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:39,843
- So have you got it?
- Got what?

81
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,970
We've got a problem.

82
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:50,090
Code red.

83
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:54,887
Do you hear me?
Code red, I repeat...

84
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:58,727
...a man is walking
into the ladies room.

85
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:14,083
Miss Veronica?

86
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:26,883
Ok baby, baby we gotta go...

87
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:43,843
Miss Veronica?

88
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:54,090
Are you alright?

89
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:55,843
The key's in the bag.

90
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:57,609
Get moving!

91
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:10,723
You'd better get out of here.
Go!

92
00:17:15,562 --> 00:17:18,083
They stole the diamonds!

93
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,803
Asshole!
You said no fucking guns!

94
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:28,010
They switched them
with the real! They're glass!

95
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:32,166
- Where's my fucking passport?
- They're fucking glass!

96
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,686
- You'd better kill me now, bitch!
- Oh, shut the fuck up!

97
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:44,803
Call security!

98
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:47,050
You understand... dead!

99
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:49,923
I repeat... don't move!

100
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,729
Stay where you are!

101
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:17,282
Don't move!

102
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:19,529
Don't move or I'll shoot!

103
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:30,406
Shit...

104
00:18:39,722 --> 00:18:41,282
Hey, Racine!

105
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,247
Racine?

106
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:52,806
Okay, we're here,
but what's going on?

107
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:58,559
That bitch double crossed us.
She's got the diamonds!

108
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:01,767
Oh no. Where is she?

109
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:04,643
In Paris. She's got some girlfriend
in Belleville.

110
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:14,464
Yeah...

111
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:18,399
No, no. You don't understand.
I need a passport yesterday.

112
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:54,883
Did you get it?

113
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:02,243
What is it?

114
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:08,006
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

115
00:20:09,962 --> 00:20:11,751
Excuse me, madame...

116
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:13,987
...but I believe this is
a free country.

117
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,643
And I'm entitled to make
any picture of anything...

118
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:18,890
...and anyone I want
from my balcony.

119
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:22,090
Go fuck yourself!

120
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,286
Go to church.
Try to save your soul.

121
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,203
Got you!

122
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:44,162
My darling!

123
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:40,483
Yes, that's strange.
Yes, it's her.

124
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:51,366
Do you really think it's her?

125
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:00,643
Lily!

126
00:22:05,162 --> 00:22:06,722
Wait!

127
00:22:09,002 --> 00:22:10,889
But what is she doing?

128
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:13,762
Wait for us!

129
00:22:15,722 --> 00:22:17,282
Lily! Wait!

130
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:24,806
- Wait, Lily!
- Charles De Gaulle. Hotel Sheraton.

131
00:22:25,163 --> 00:22:26,723
Go and get the car.

132
00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:02,089
What do you want?

133
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,766
Don't move!

134
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:44,010
Stay put! Right!

135
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:46,242
Take off your glasses...

136
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:49,766
Good. The light is perfect.

137
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:53,606
- Brought the money?
- Of course!

138
00:24:54,282 --> 00:24:57,446
- Perfect for what?
- I need a picture for the passport.

139
00:25:01,962 --> 00:25:04,166
I got you, fucking bitch!

140
00:25:04,522 --> 00:25:05,766
Come on!

141
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:09,923
Before I snap
your double-crossing neck...

142
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:12,803
...just tell me one thing.

143
00:25:14,762 --> 00:25:16,322
Where are...

144
00:25:17,322 --> 00:25:18,882
...the diamonds?

145
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:26,882
Pay back time, bitch!

146
00:25:45,162 --> 00:25:46,722
Oh my god!

147
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:51,522
Don't touch her!

148
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:13,766
- Are you preparing the tea?
- Yes, of course.

149
00:26:14,762 --> 00:26:16,005
Forget it!

150
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:20,170
- We should have done something.
- It's none of our business.

151
00:26:20,842 --> 00:26:24,322
Oh right, you read two words
and she falls apart.

152
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:27,202
People die and
wills have to be read.

153
00:26:27,882 --> 00:26:31,046
Did you see the look on her face?
And her hair?

154
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:34,886
- What has she done with her hair?
- I'm just a notary, damn it!

155
00:26:35,882 --> 00:26:39,045
What if the kids and I were killed?
Would you give a damn what I left you?

156
00:26:39,722 --> 00:26:42,143
When your gun disappeared,
I knew she would do something crazy.

157
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:44,803
- How do you know she stole it?
- Who else?

158
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:47,042
Go check on the tea.

159
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:55,686
Feeling better, Lily?

160
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,243
Excuse me,
but I don't understand...

161
00:26:58,602 --> 00:27:01,123
Now, you just shut up, honey,
save your strenght.

162
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:03,043
You just have to rest.

163
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,609
You have suffered
a terrible tragedy...

164
00:27:06,282 --> 00:27:08,486
...and you need time to get better,
you know.

165
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:13,599
And if you get the urge to do anything
silly, I want you to call me.

166
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:18,722
Before we leave...

167
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,610
I want you to answer
just one question.

168
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:26,406
Did you borrow Louis's gun?

169
00:27:29,322 --> 00:27:31,210
Are you sure?

170
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:38,890
Okay, but if you come across it,
you'll tell me, won't you?

171
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,086
Good.

172
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:44,966
I'll turn the TV on
so you'll have company.

173
00:27:51,882 --> 00:27:54,085
We'll be back tonight
with some dinner.

174
00:27:58,282 --> 00:28:00,170
Drink your tea while it's hot.

175
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:21,290
Holly shit!

176
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,970
Ah, my god!

177
00:28:33,642 --> 00:28:36,162
And if you could see the future
in a crystal ball...

178
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:39,362
...or in the palm of your hand,
or in a dream...

179
00:28:40,362 --> 00:28:41,922
...would you change it?

180
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:50,246
So what should one think
of these phenomenon?

181
00:28:50,602 --> 00:28:52,806
How can they be explained?

182
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,686
Is it really possible
to receive messages...

183
00:28:56,362 --> 00:28:58,882
...from what one might call
the "hereafter"...

184
00:29:01,482 --> 00:29:04,962
Could one be unconsciously gifted
with a perception power...

185
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:08,486
...which would allow us...

186
00:35:08,202 --> 00:35:10,089
"I thought I could start over
in America.

187
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:12,169
My English is not so good,
but I'm a fast learner.

188
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,248
I even bought myself a ticket
but I lost it.

189
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:16,329
I can't live without
Thierry and Brigitte.

190
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:18,725
Forgive me, my God.
Allow us to be together again."

191
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:38,885
There's been a mistake. The computer
has sold the same seat twice.

192
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,769
I'm terribly sorry.

193
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:46,561
Could we accommodate you
in our first class cabin?

194
00:37:48,522 --> 00:37:50,409
This way please.
It's right here.

195
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:03,048
Excuse me.

196
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:45,922
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

197
00:38:46,921 --> 00:38:49,769
I'm sorry I woke you up.

198
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:55,202
You fell asleep here.
Are you OK?

199
00:38:57,481 --> 00:39:00,002
I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm sorry. Are you OK?

200
00:39:01,321 --> 00:39:02,882
I'm sorry.

201
00:39:03,562 --> 00:39:05,122
Do you speak French?

202
00:39:05,482 --> 00:39:07,369
- I'm sorry.
- Are you American?

203
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:10,885
California.

204
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:13,121
I mean I grew up
in California...

205
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:15,041
...but I live in Washington now.

206
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,641
- What do you do in life?
- In life?

207
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:24,801
Well, I started in software.

208
00:39:27,562 --> 00:39:29,765
And made some money...

209
00:39:30,442 --> 00:39:33,289
...and found out that
I was interested in other things.

210
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:36,482
Like what things?

211
00:39:38,122 --> 00:39:40,227
Well, like the whole world...

212
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,248
I went back to school
in Washington,

213
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:45,122
I got a degree in Foreign Relations.
I taught for a little while...

214
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:48,645
...and then I got a posting
at the State Department.

215
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:54,728
America is a country
very big, no?

216
00:39:57,001 --> 00:39:59,849
Very big.
Is this your first trip?

217
00:40:02,122 --> 00:40:04,009
I begin my new life there.

218
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:07,202
France is no good for me.

219
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:10,402
How can you say that?
France is a fabulous country.

220
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:13,928
Really. That's the...
Queen of Europe to me.

221
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:15,842
The art, the history...

222
00:40:16,201 --> 00:40:19,682
...the sense of language,
Stendhal, Racine, Balzac...

223
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:27,041
I lost my baby there...

224
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:35,369
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

225
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,601
That's terrible.

226
00:40:38,281 --> 00:40:40,169
Please forgive me.

227
00:40:42,121 --> 00:40:43,682
It's OK. It's OK.

228
00:40:45,961 --> 00:40:47,522
That is just awful.

229
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:15,208
Hi! Mister Bardo is not here
at the moment.

230
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:17,765
What are you doing?
Trying to dodge bill collectors?

231
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:20,008
- Nick, it's Johnny.
- I know who you are.

232
00:41:20,361 --> 00:41:21,823
- What are you doing?
- Working.

233
00:41:21,961 --> 00:41:25,125
- Something I can sell?
- Could be. I just need one more piece.

234
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:28,005
Another shot of that table?
What's happen' to you?

235
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,249
- Are you eating?
- Barely.

236
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:33,448
How would you like a break from your
masterwork and make some real money?

237
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:37,125
- What are you selling?
- You know who Bruce Hewitt Watts is?

238
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:41,285
As strange as it may seem to you, Jean,
photographers actually read.

239
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:44,383
You know books, magazines,
and even daily newspapers.

240
00:41:44,521 --> 00:41:46,081
All right, all right, smart ass,
who is he?

241
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:48,965
- The new American ambassador?
- Bingo.

242
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:53,128
He's got a wife but no one seems
to have a picture of her.

243
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:56,863
- Maybe she's camera shy.
- No, she's not camera shy.

244
00:41:57,001 --> 00:41:58,888
She's got a past and
she's not talking about it.

245
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:01,129
And I did some checking and
found out she's really French.

246
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:03,041
Married before
with a kid.

247
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:06,565
I've got an ex I don't talk about
either. What's wrong with that?

248
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:09,029
Nothing except that
you don't dodge photographers...

249
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:10,721
...like you've got something
to hide.

250
00:42:11,721 --> 00:42:14,242
- So you want me to nail her, right?
- You are the best.

251
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:19,038
I don't like to do this.
I feel like shit.

252
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:22,565
- And besides, I am retired.
- On what? IOUs?

253
00:42:22,921 --> 00:42:26,085
I'm not just your agent Nicolas,
I'm your bank and you're way past due.

254
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:29,921
Do yourself a favor and go to work.
I can get 5 figures for this picture.

255
00:42:33,961 --> 00:42:36,164
All right. What's her schedule?

256
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:39,044
She arrives
by private jet tonight.

257
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:43,521
- I gotta go, I gotta go. Bye.
- Take that picture.

258
00:43:06,761 --> 00:43:08,648
Be careful. You almost fell!

259
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:11,368
Where are you going?

260
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:16,325
Let's see if you understand me.
Listen, I'm looking for public toilets.

261
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:18,568
The Champs Elysées are
over there or over here?

262
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:27,838
I'd like to go to the public toilets
which are in that direction. Please.

263
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,962
If you understand me,
in that direction...

264
00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:05,121
And thanks for the ride!

265
00:44:53,321 --> 00:44:54,881
Can we jump in?

266
00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:02,622
Nice wheels!

267
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,924
What did you expect?
I only steal the best!

268
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:11,524
- Is this Nicolas Bardo?
- Speaking.

269
00:45:11,721 --> 00:45:13,608
You took a picture
of Mrs. Watts?

270
00:45:15,561 --> 00:45:17,121
Who wants to know?

271
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,685
Leonard Shiff.
Head of Watts' security.

272
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:21,921
I'd like to buy it.

273
00:45:23,241 --> 00:45:26,405
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Shiff,
but it's already been sold.

274
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:29,921
Unsell it. We'll double
whatever you've got.

275
00:45:30,921 --> 00:45:33,342
That's very generous but I...

276
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,684
I don't think you realize
who you're dealing with, Mr. Bardo.

277
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:38,888
We know all about you,
your overdrawn bank account...

278
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,444
...your criminal record.
I suggest...

279
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,324
...you get that picture back
and you bring it to me...

280
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,521
...at the residence tomorrow
morning 11a.m. Sharp.

281
00:45:48,521 --> 00:45:52,318
- Don't keep me waiting.
- Sir, hold on! Hello!

282
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:56,008
Nice going, man. Really.

283
00:45:57,641 --> 00:45:59,844
Thanks for keeping your mouth shut.

284
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:04,005
They must have offered you
some sweet deals to talk?

285
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:06,568
There was nothing
to talk about.

286
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:12,645
They just asked about the diamonds,
of which I knew shit.

287
00:46:13,641 --> 00:46:16,162
Once the insurance paid off,
they stopped asking.

288
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:21,289
Don't worry, man!
That bitch knows.

289
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:24,804
I thought about her
every fucking minute...

290
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:30,245
...every fucking hour,
for seven fucking years!

291
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:34,408
Where is she?

292
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:42,721
I've been looking. I talked to
everyone, I never stopped.

293
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:47,169
I ran down every scumbag
that ever knew her.

294
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,448
She just vanished off
the face of the earth?

295
00:46:49,801 --> 00:46:52,005
Hey, I'm not Interpol, alright!

296
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:54,889
I've been fucked same as you!

297
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:58,408
I did a hell of a lot
of checking!

298
00:47:00,681 --> 00:47:03,201
I've got one thing,
maybe, one thing...

299
00:47:06,441 --> 00:47:08,328
You know that girlfriend of hers?

300
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:10,561
The brunette...

301
00:47:12,841 --> 00:47:16,321
She's fencing diamonds.
It's all I've got.

302
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,285
Wait, wait.

303
00:47:41,961 --> 00:47:43,521
Excuse me, officer...

304
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:45,928
There is less and less sun.

305
00:48:56,841 --> 00:48:58,401
Let's wait for the sun.

306
00:50:28,841 --> 00:50:31,045
Park Bardo in the office
until I can get...

307
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,681
Hold on a second.

308
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,724
I don't believe it. This paparazzi scum
is wearing a wire.

309
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,440
Make sure he doesn't get
passed security.

310
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,644
Hold on...

311
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,724
- Can you help me, please?
- One minute, pal.

312
00:54:31,881 --> 00:54:33,768
Damn it! Damn it!

313
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:36,321
Oh shit!

314
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,724
- Is the bar open?
- Yes of course, sir.

315
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,247
But you can't stay there.
Please move your bike.

316
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,881
- You can't leave it there.
- I know, I know.

317
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,167
- Please...
- Okay.

318
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,764
Hi! I'm sorry to bother you but
I rented this room last night...

319
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,007
...and I think I left my disk here.

320
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,887
- A disk?
- When I got home...

321
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,761
I checked my laptop,
and the backup disk was gone!

322
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:21,921
It's the only copy I have and I've been
searching like hell for it.

323
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,397
Then I remembered the only place
I could have left it was... here.

324
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,865
So did you mind if I come in
and just take a look around?

325
00:56:29,001 --> 00:56:31,521
- I don't think it's a good idea...
- Thank you very much.

326
00:56:32,841 --> 00:56:34,247
I appreciate it.

327
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,524
Thank you.

328
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,400
Oh my God, I got so much information
in that disk.

329
00:56:45,321 --> 00:56:48,168
You didn't see a disk right?
I mean, actually it's not a disk.

330
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,407
It's not like a CD or a DVD
or anything like that...

331
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,557
...it's called floppy. It's a black thing
that you introduce in the computer.

332
00:56:55,881 --> 00:56:58,728
I am remembering now
that I put it there...

333
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,560
...'cause I was working in bed.
I just love to work in bed.

334
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,240
I bet you do too.
Anyway, let me...

335
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,124
Let just remember
exactly what I did.

336
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,360
I sat over here.

337
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,746
I sat over here and I put it on my lap,
because it's a laptop...

338
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,768
...and I just plugged it
over there and...

339
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,284
Actually, you know what had happened?
What happened is that I wasn't alone.

340
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,520
I wasn't alone and then...

341
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,360
Oh my God!

342
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,244
That's not your business.

343
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,120
Well, ah... No, it's not.

344
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,008
It's not but it is.

345
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,240
Because...

346
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,844
Excuse me...

347
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,720
Are you alright?

348
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,927
I think I can help you.

349
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,168
I have been working in a hospital
for a couple of years and...

350
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,368
I was a kind of a candy striper myself.
Just sit down over here.

351
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,884
Give me your arms. Put them up.
Just like this and... Relax! Relax!

352
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,128
And breathe, breathe and relax.

353
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,000
And now listen to me.
Good.

354
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,160
I know, because I have been accused of
having an overactive imagination...

355
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,724
...but when a classy woman
like yourself...

356
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,600
...checks into an airport hotel,
in the middle of the morning...

357
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,124
...with a bunch of bullets and a gun,
there's only one word that follows.

358
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,527
What word?

359
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,647
"Bang".

360
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,164
Now, if a guy walks in...

361
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,724
...maybe there doesn't have
to be a "bang".

362
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,968
Maybe there is something
to talk about?

363
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,484
Coffee?

364
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,397
Maybe we should have start
with some introductions?

365
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,607
I don't care who you are.

366
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,484
And I definitely don't want
you to know who I am.

367
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,727
All right, that's fair enough.

368
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,641
Let's call me...
"Harry"...

369
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,808
...and let's start with the shiner.

370
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,361
Who's beating you up?

371
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,488
- Must we talk about this?
- Yes.

372
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,003
Or we're gonna find
the local police station...

373
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,248
...and we're gonna talk
about it there.

374
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,880
- My husband.
- All right, why?

375
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,047
He has...

376
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,044
...difficulty to control
his temper.

377
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,167
Why does he lose it?

378
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,680
Because I can't live
with him here.

379
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,447
- Why not?
- I have a past here.

380
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,607
I was safe in the States
but here...

381
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,808
...it only takes one photo...

382
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,480
Like the one today?

383
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,721
I took that picture.

384
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,040
So "Harry" is Nicolas Bardo.

385
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,804
Why did you follow me,
to get more photos?

386
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,360
No, no, I...

387
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,527
I just came to tell
your security goon, Mr. Shiff...

388
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,048
...that I couldn't stop the picture
from being published. I'm sorry.

389
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,564
Anyone can see that.
You've wasted your time.

390
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,207
This espresso is cold.

391
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,767
- Can I get you another cup?
- Why?

392
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,967
There's nothing more to say.

393
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,168
Can I go now?
You have the gun.

394
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,044
Sex Shops are open all day.

395
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,928
I don't think I'll be going to one.

396
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,120
How can I be sure?

397
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,281
Just stay with me.

398
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,444
I need air but I don't want
to talk anymore.

399
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,204
Good...
So where is she?

400
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,767
The ambassador is
extremely worried.

401
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:21,283
The police? God, no.

402
01:01:22,919 --> 01:01:24,163
Keep calling Shiff...

403
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,084
Right when I got divorced,
I just decided to leave Spain...

404
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,287
...and come here to Paris to prevent
myself... kind of think, you know...

405
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,167
I mean I've got these crazy
photographer ideas...

406
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,361
...and don't think for a second that
I am a paparazzi. I hate them.

407
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,568
I feel like shit but I have to make
some money. That's the only way...

408
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,807
But... There is
a square here in Paris...

409
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,963
...full of coffee shops, beautiful,
and there is one in particular...

410
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,524
...in a corner, you know,
with these light reflections...

411
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,767
...and I saw something
that changed my life...

412
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,968
- It's a great story, Nicolas.
- This is the best part!

413
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,207
I know. I know.
Maybe another time.

414
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,363
It's a great story
but right now I'm...

415
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,440
...very tired and I would just like to
take a warm bath and relax a little...

416
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,963
...before I go home, OK?
Thank you for today.

417
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,160
I'll be waiting out here...
Just in case you need anything...

418
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,601
- You don't trust me, do you?
- No, no, no. It's not that.

419
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,160
Its just being careful.

420
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,287
- Are you all right?
- No.

421
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,408
- I'm out of my medicine.
- There was a pharmacy in the airport.

422
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,967
Oh that's right.

423
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,088
My inhaler is in my car.

424
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,320
They can refill it
for me there.

425
01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:19,207
That wouldn't be being careful...

426
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:22,087
Nicolas, take my car...

427
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,160
...take my purse if you're so
worried that I go somewhere.

428
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,807
You can call a taxi,
I don't...

429
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,924
Yes, Nicolas,
I could call a taxi.

430
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,407
But I'm not going to do that.

431
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,047
I'm not going to need these
in the bath.

432
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:53,280
Hey! Wait.

433
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:58,080
I'm definitely not going anywhere
without them.

434
01:04:08,999 --> 01:04:11,203
Are you flirting with me?

435
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:17,126
Was I?

436
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,444
I believe so, yeah.

437
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,127
I didn't mean to.

438
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,007
Its just that...

439
01:04:29,319 --> 01:04:33,116
...all your boyhood stories
make you so...

440
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,327
...damn lovable.

441
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,324
Was that the point?

442
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,807
Hello, is this police?

443
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,967
Madre de Dios.
My name is Sophia.

444
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:45,116
I call now from the airport
De Gaulle. Yes, De Gaulle.

445
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,604
A man just hit the lady
in front of the pharmacy.

446
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:56,641
Yes, wait a second. Yes, man
is still there, but I see no lady.

447
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,524
Yes, he steal her car.

448
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,727
No, I can't. No, not possible.
No, sorry.

449
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,600
My husband calling me. Sorry.
No, I can't.

450
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:13,661
Is it your car?

451
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:16,320
It's not mine but...
Somebody lend it to me and...

452
01:06:36,776 --> 01:06:38,303
Come in!

453
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,367
Good morning.

454
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,727
You can put it there.

455
01:07:00,999 --> 01:07:03,520
- Could you hand me my bag?
- Of course.

456
01:07:03,879 --> 01:07:05,767
It's over there by the bed.

457
01:07:21,319 --> 01:07:24,167
- I can't find it.
- Maybe on the floor?

458
01:07:28,999 --> 01:07:30,887
I'm sorry but I don't see it.

459
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,203
This is the gun
we found in the Mercedes.

460
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:37,763
- Any details?
- No, it's not registered.

461
01:07:38,439 --> 01:07:41,920
Concerning the car...
It belongs to the American Embassy.

462
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:57,763
This doesn't make much sense.
I'm Chief Inspector Serra.

463
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,640
Maybe you can help me out?

464
01:08:01,639 --> 01:08:03,200
I said it already.

465
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,400
But, OK.
Alright.

466
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:09,283
Mrs. Watts was trying
to kill herself.

467
01:08:10,279 --> 01:08:11,686
I stopped her...

468
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:14,083
...so she set me up for you guys,
to get me out of her way.

469
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:16,967
How did you come up with that?

470
01:08:18,919 --> 01:08:22,400
I read a lot of mysteries and I just
figure out the endings half way...

471
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:26,141
I put the clues together and
I know what happened, sir.

472
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:28,166
What happened, Mr. Bardo...

473
01:08:28,519 --> 01:08:32,000
...was a car belonging to Ambassador
Watts was found in your possession.

474
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:33,920
I know, I know that...

475
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,920
On the front seat was
a gun, bullets...

476
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,760
...blouse and dress.

477
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,564
The only thing missing is the woman.

478
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,567
Where is she?

479
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:54,247
I don't know. I don't know...

480
01:08:55,559 --> 01:08:58,080
- You checked out the hotel?
- Yeah, we checked the room.

481
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:00,967
We found a naked waitress
in a coma.

482
01:09:02,919 --> 01:09:05,123
Did you have anything
to do with that?

483
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:08,323
No.

484
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,484
I wasn't there.
I was buying an inhaler.

485
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:14,723
Inhaler?

486
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:16,643
Yes...

487
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:22,243
An inhaler. All right?
Mrs. Watts has asthma.

488
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,723
So I went to a pharmacy to get
her prescription refilled. That's it.

489
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,760
So, you figured...

490
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:38,560
...by having her car and her clothes,
she wasn't going anywhere?

491
01:09:40,519 --> 01:09:42,080
That's correct, yeah.

492
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,240
And you kept the gun
so she wouldn't shoot herself?

493
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,120
That's right.

494
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,327
Why would she want to do that?

495
01:09:55,879 --> 01:09:58,727
- Excuse me?
- Why would she want to do that?

496
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:03,843
Well, her husband was beating her up
because she wanted to leave him.

497
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,363
The American Ambassador
beats his wife?

498
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:15,040
That's right, that's right, yes.

499
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:18,243
And she has
the face to prove it...

500
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,600
You see...

501
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,163
I'm kind of
a mystery buff myself.

502
01:10:30,119 --> 01:10:32,323
And you know what kind
of mystery this is?

503
01:10:35,879 --> 01:10:37,439
- A kidnapping.
- Oh come on!

504
01:10:37,799 --> 01:10:39,686
Ambassador's wife held
for ransom.

505
01:10:40,039 --> 01:10:42,887
Everything was going fine until
someone reported a stolen car.

506
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,566
You didn't even have time
to send the ransom note...

507
01:10:46,759 --> 01:10:49,280
...or did you?
- No. What are you talking about?

508
01:10:50,599 --> 01:10:53,447
I am no kidnapper, sir.

509
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,003
Why don't we take a ride
down to the Residence...

510
01:10:56,359 --> 01:10:58,563
...and see what the Ambassador
has to say about that?

511
01:10:58,919 --> 01:11:01,439
I think this is
a terrible misunderstanding.

512
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,686
I spoke with Mrs. Watts...

513
01:11:04,039 --> 01:11:06,560
...she explained to me how
she let Mr. Bardo use her car.

514
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,760
I don't know who reported it stolen
because it wasn't.

515
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,007
And my attorney,
Mrs. Phillips...

516
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:14,879
...has indicated to me that
no crime has been committed...

517
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:18,719
...so I'm a little confused as to
what we are doing here, inspector.

518
01:11:19,719 --> 01:11:22,240
- You spoke to your wife yourself?
- Yes, I did.

519
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:27,359
- Could I speak with her?
- I don't think that's necessary.

520
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:30,887
This has been an awkward situation
for all of us concerned...

521
01:11:31,559 --> 01:11:34,079
...and I really...
I don't want to prolong it.

522
01:11:38,759 --> 01:11:41,923
Mrs. Phillips will have to handle
your questions from now on.

523
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:44,166
I have an engagement.
Please excuse me.

524
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:59,836
Inspector Serra, you've displayed
a boorish lack of sensitivity...

525
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,720
towards the American Ambassador.

526
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:06,563
We do not need or want your
investigative skills employed...

527
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:11,036
...to discover why Mrs. Watts was in
a hotel bedroom with Mr. Bardo.

528
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,160
I suggest you return to
your duties and drop this matter.

529
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:19,207
The less said about it the better.

530
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:24,228
I'd still like
to talk to Mrs. Watts.

531
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:28,799
- And what crime has she committed?
- No crime, I just want to see her.

532
01:12:29,799 --> 01:12:32,963
Well, I'm sure we all want
to see lots of people...

533
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:37,126
...but fortunately in our country
and in yours...

534
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:40,643
...they are not compelled to see us.

535
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:43,526
Good day, Inspector.

536
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:48,225
Sir!

537
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:50,879
Do you know the penalty for having
an illegal hand gun?

538
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:53,759
- I told you, it's not my gun.
- OK. Then we'll just keep it.

539
01:12:54,759 --> 01:12:56,647
Now, about your motorcycle...

540
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:00,803
- You really want to report it stolen?
- Of course I want to report it stolen.

541
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:02,719
If it wasn't at the hotel,
somebody took it, sir.

542
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:04,639
Why don't you look a little harder?

543
01:13:04,999 --> 01:13:06,886
If it doesn't turn up in a few days,
give me a call.

544
01:13:07,559 --> 01:13:11,683
Sir, you don't believe one goddamn
thing I said, right?

545
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:15,199
Not only don't I believe you,
I don't even like you.

546
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:18,403
Look, Bardo, I know who you are.

547
01:13:18,759 --> 01:13:21,607
Ex-paparazzi smart ass who
hasn't worked for seven years.

548
01:13:22,279 --> 01:13:24,799
I don't know what you're up to
but it's not smart.

549
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:27,679
And if you keep it up, you're going
to wind up on a cell block...

550
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:29,926
...full of smart guys just like you.

551
01:15:32,519 --> 01:15:34,079
"Mr. Watts...

552
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:36,642
...if you ever want
to see your wife again...

553
01:15:37,639 --> 01:15:39,199
...bring 10 million dollars...

554
01:15:39,879 --> 01:15:42,400
...in Bearer Bonds to
the Passerelle Debilly...

555
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:44,639
...at 2 a.m. This morning.

556
01:15:45,319 --> 01:15:48,166
If you inform the police or arrive
with anyone besides yourself...

557
01:15:50,439 --> 01:15:52,000
...she will be killed."

558
01:15:55,559 --> 01:15:57,119
Oh shit.

559
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:04,166
Son of a bitch!

560
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:16,806
Mrs. Watts...

561
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:21,439
Call me Lily.

562
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:24,640
Okay, Lily.

563
01:16:26,599 --> 01:16:28,803
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Lily?

564
01:16:29,799 --> 01:16:31,360
Are you mad at me?

565
01:16:31,719 --> 01:16:33,607
Mad? Nah...

566
01:16:34,599 --> 01:16:36,803
You're making everybody think
I've kidnapped you.

567
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:40,639
Haven't you?

568
01:16:40,999 --> 01:16:42,559
That is not funny...

569
01:16:42,919 --> 01:16:44,806
No, Nicolas. You're right.
It's not funny.

570
01:16:45,799 --> 01:16:48,003
It wasn't funny when you sold my picture
to the papers either.

571
01:16:48,999 --> 01:16:51,104
Then you showed up
to do what?

572
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:54,086
Explain, apologize, lie?

573
01:16:55,239 --> 01:16:58,719
I was afraid for your life.
I felt responsible for it, damn it!

574
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:01,603
That's so sweet, Nicolas.

575
01:17:04,839 --> 01:17:06,726
I'm a bad girl, Nicolas.

576
01:17:08,679 --> 01:17:10,239
Real bad.

577
01:17:11,239 --> 01:17:13,127
Rotten to the heart.

578
01:17:13,799 --> 01:17:16,319
Last scrape I was in
I fucked up a lot of people.

579
01:17:17,639 --> 01:17:20,159
Bad people. People like me.
People that don't forget.

580
01:17:22,759 --> 01:17:24,647
But I was given a second chance.

581
01:17:25,798 --> 01:17:29,595
So I went back to States where I got
everything a bad girl ever wanted.

582
01:17:31,558 --> 01:17:33,446
Fucking Watts!

583
01:17:35,719 --> 01:17:39,516
He was sweet, until being the richest
man in the world wasn't enough.

584
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:43,046
He had to have public glory.

585
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:45,919
So he gave away
a ton of money...

586
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:48,166
...bought himself
the French Ambassadorship.

587
01:17:48,519 --> 01:17:51,683
Which meant the Misses got dragged out
into the Parisian limelight.

588
01:17:53,319 --> 01:17:54,879
Well, I couldn't do that Nicolas...

589
01:17:55,239 --> 01:17:57,443
...'cause bad people
read newspapers too.

590
01:17:58,119 --> 01:17:59,679
There you go.

591
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:03,526
Enter my worst nightmare.

592
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:08,159
You snap that fucking picture,
sell it to the tabloids.

593
01:18:08,839 --> 01:18:12,320
And now it's only a matter of time
before those bad people come running.

594
01:18:15,559 --> 01:18:18,723
So I got the photographer turned
blackmailer to kidnapped me.

595
01:18:20,679 --> 01:18:23,199
Blackmailer?
You offered me money!

596
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:27,047
And I have never kidnapped anybody,
you fucking bitch!

597
01:18:28,039 --> 01:18:29,600
Then where am I, Nicolas?

598
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:34,402
Why did you have my car,
my clothes, a gun?

599
01:18:36,039 --> 01:18:38,886
Why was a ransom note
e-mailed from your computer?

600
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:43,363
- Everyone knows you did it.
- I've got to think. I've got to think.

601
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:46,247
I've got to think.

602
01:18:46,599 --> 01:18:49,119
Don't bother.
You don't have to think about anything.

603
01:18:49,479 --> 01:18:51,682
I've got it all thought out
for you.

604
01:18:52,039 --> 01:18:55,520
Watts is coming up here at 2 a.m.
With 10 million dollars in a briefcase.

605
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:58,402
Now if you start being
a little nice to me...

606
01:18:59,399 --> 01:19:01,286
I might catch you in on the take.

607
01:19:06,759 --> 01:19:08,646
We are going to the police.

608
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:10,886
Why would you want to do that?

609
01:19:11,559 --> 01:19:14,079
Because you're gonna tell them
the crazy story you just told me.

610
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:17,283
Nicolas?
You think I'm stupid?

611
01:19:17,959 --> 01:19:21,123
I'm going to tell them
a kidnapping story...

612
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:23,525
...starring you.

613
01:19:25,639 --> 01:19:27,527
Son of a bitch! Fuck...

614
01:19:27,879 --> 01:19:30,082
- Nicolas!
- Hold. Hold on. Hold on.

615
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:32,960
See, I did have time
to go back to that sex shop.

616
01:19:33,639 --> 01:19:35,199
C'mon!

617
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:38,087
What did you do with that other gun
I gave you?

618
01:19:38,759 --> 01:19:40,646
- The cops took it.
- They took it?

619
01:19:42,759 --> 01:19:45,509
- I got you another one. Come here.
- Be careful with that thing.

620
01:19:45,639 --> 01:19:47,199
It's all right.

621
01:19:52,678 --> 01:19:55,842
Isn't sugar better than vinegar?

622
01:19:57,478 --> 01:19:58,722
Come on.

623
01:20:06,118 --> 01:20:08,006
We've got a couple hours, baby.

624
01:20:09,319 --> 01:20:11,523
Let's go do something fun,
want you?

625
01:20:32,038 --> 01:20:34,886
How come you're the only man in this
room that doesn't want to fuck me?

626
01:20:38,758 --> 01:20:40,962
Nicolas! Where are you going?

627
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:43,424
I'm just going to buy some cigarettes.
And you know...

628
01:20:43,558 --> 01:20:45,446
...don't worry,
I'm not going anywhere...

629
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:48,002
...while you've got my balls
in your pocket, Lily.

630
01:20:55,399 --> 01:20:57,286
Pack of cigarettes.
Anything American.

631
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:04,959
22 francs.

632
01:21:19,719 --> 01:21:21,126
Hey, Nicolas! Come here!

633
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:23,526
Meet my friend, Napoleon.

634
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:26,086
I think he is in love.

635
01:21:27,399 --> 01:21:30,246
Can we just go outside for a second?
I need to talk to you.

636
01:21:30,598 --> 01:21:33,119
Nicolas, com'on we're having fun.
Just be cool.

637
01:21:33,478 --> 01:21:35,366
Well, I'm gonna go outside, all right?

638
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:39,515
Nicolas, we don't want you to wait out
in the cold, do we Napoleon?

639
01:21:41,158 --> 01:21:42,719
I mean, if we hit it off...

640
01:21:48,199 --> 01:21:50,719
I don't know, I was kind of thinking
of letting you off the hook.

641
01:21:51,079 --> 01:21:52,485
- Really?
- Yeah.

642
01:21:52,678 --> 01:21:54,882
I mean, you don't seem to be enjoying
my company much.

643
01:21:55,879 --> 01:21:59,042
Maybe Napoleon and I should just
sail off into the sunset.

644
01:21:59,719 --> 01:22:01,606
And you can go fuck yourself.

645
01:25:42,118 --> 01:25:43,678
I hope you didn't kill him.

646
01:25:45,318 --> 01:25:47,522
He was going to save me
from a dip in the Seine.

647
01:25:47,878 --> 01:25:49,122
What?

648
01:25:49,479 --> 01:25:53,275
We had big plans. I was going off
the bridge into his boat.

649
01:25:55,078 --> 01:25:57,282
Oh poor Lily,
whatever happened to her?

650
01:25:57,638 --> 01:26:00,158
She must have drowned
and washed out to sea.

651
01:26:01,159 --> 01:26:04,006
Thanks a lot,
you've ruined everything.

652
01:26:07,558 --> 01:26:08,965
Fuck you.

653
01:26:15,238 --> 01:26:18,086
What's the matter, Nicolas?
Did I make you jealous?

654
01:26:19,078 --> 01:26:20,639
Jealous? Yes.

655
01:26:23,239 --> 01:26:25,759
I was jealous.
I am jealous.

656
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:30,559
Come on, Nicolas!
You don't have to lick my ass.

657
01:26:31,238 --> 01:26:32,645
Just fuck me.

658
01:26:36,838 --> 01:26:38,398
- You know what?
- What?

659
01:26:39,078 --> 01:26:40,639
We can still go away.

660
01:26:42,279 --> 01:26:44,166
Both of us. Together.

661
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:51,199
That's so sweet.

662
01:26:52,839 --> 01:26:54,399
Come here. Come here.

663
01:27:08,038 --> 01:27:09,599
That's so romantic.

664
01:27:10,918 --> 01:27:12,479
Without the money?

665
01:27:14,758 --> 01:27:16,165
Are you nuts?

666
01:27:42,438 --> 01:27:44,326
That's a choice.

667
01:27:45,639 --> 01:27:48,802
A bad choice.
There are other ones.

668
01:27:49,479 --> 01:27:51,682
What? Like doing the right thing?

669
01:27:56,518 --> 01:27:58,405
That's a start.

670
01:28:00,998 --> 01:28:02,886
I tried that once, Nicolas.

671
01:28:06,438 --> 01:28:07,999
And you know what it got me?

672
01:28:10,278 --> 01:28:12,482
A lifetime of looking
over my shoulder.

673
01:28:15,078 --> 01:28:17,599
You know why no good deed
goes unpunished?

674
01:28:20,198 --> 01:28:23,679
Because this world is hell and
you're nothing but a fucking patsy.

675
01:28:28,838 --> 01:28:31,042
I made everybody think
you kidnapped me...

676
01:28:31,398 --> 01:28:33,919
...so I could screw my husband
out of 10 million bucks.

677
01:28:34,918 --> 01:28:36,478
That's what it's all about...

678
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:39,999
...me disappearing with
10 million bucks.

679
01:28:41,318 --> 01:28:43,522
So... wipe it off...

680
01:28:44,518 --> 01:28:46,078
...and let's go get it.

681
01:28:55,078 --> 01:28:56,322
Fuck you.

682
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:18,405
You're not gonna hurt her, right?

683
01:29:18,758 --> 01:29:20,962
Because I've done exactly
what you told me to do.

684
01:29:23,878 --> 01:29:25,438
I've brought the money...

685
01:29:26,118 --> 01:29:28,005
...and I haven't talked to anyone.

686
01:29:39,718 --> 01:29:42,239
- Don't do anything foolish, darling.
- I won't.

687
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:46,399
He just wants me to take the money
and bring it back to him.

688
01:29:58,279 --> 01:30:00,166
It's Nicolas Bardo.

689
01:30:00,518 --> 01:30:03,365
Your wife is staging this kidnapping
to take you for 10 million bucks.

690
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:06,242
If you don't believe me,
I got it right here on tape.

691
01:30:12,838 --> 01:30:14,725
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

692
01:30:15,078 --> 01:30:16,638
You killed him?

693
01:30:16,998 --> 01:30:18,558
Just being careful.

694
01:30:31,558 --> 01:30:34,722
That fucking bitch.
She's at it again!

695
01:30:48,518 --> 01:30:50,078
The fucking bitch!

696
01:31:15,078 --> 01:31:18,242
You didn't think I'd give you a gun
loaded with real bullets, did you?

697
01:31:27,558 --> 01:31:31,039
Baby, there's one more thing
we gotta do...

698
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:41,282
Oh God, somebody help!
My husband!

699
01:31:45,478 --> 01:31:47,366
Fucking over everyone again!

700
01:31:49,638 --> 01:31:51,842
- How did you find me?
- Not this time.

701
01:31:53,158 --> 01:31:54,402
Where...

702
01:31:55,078 --> 01:31:57,282
...are the diamonds?

703
01:32:00,838 --> 01:32:02,245
Fuck you!

704
01:32:09,158 --> 01:32:10,718
Wake up, bitch...

705
01:32:14,918 --> 01:32:16,478
...before you die.

706
01:35:45,478 --> 01:35:47,038
You know what's in this?

707
01:35:49,638 --> 01:35:52,802
The bullet that is gonna spread
your brains all over that wall.

708
01:35:54,118 --> 01:35:56,005
You know how I know?
Look at me!

709
01:35:57,958 --> 01:35:59,518
I'm your fucking fairy godmother...

710
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:03,685
...and I just dreamt your future.
And mine too.

711
01:36:04,678 --> 01:36:06,238
And all I know is...

712
01:36:06,598 --> 01:36:09,019
...if there's a snowball chance in hell
that any of that shit happening...

713
01:36:09,158 --> 01:36:11,045
...we're gonna change it right here.

714
01:36:14,918 --> 01:36:16,161
Now, listen.

715
01:36:17,798 --> 01:36:19,586
I know you got a bad break,
but that's history...

716
01:36:19,718 --> 01:36:21,605
...and you'd better fuckin' forget it,
'cause if you can't...

717
01:36:22,918 --> 01:36:24,805
Well, then you may as well go
ahead and pull the trigger.

718
01:36:27,878 --> 01:36:29,765
But if you don't end it here...

719
01:36:30,758 --> 01:36:32,645
...and you get your ass
on that plane to America...

720
01:36:33,957 --> 01:36:36,161
...your future will be sitting
right next to you.

721
01:36:38,438 --> 01:36:40,543
His name is Bruce
and he's a really good guy...

722
01:36:40,677 --> 01:36:42,881
...and he's gonna look
into your eyes...

723
01:36:43,878 --> 01:36:45,438
and he's gonna fall in love.

724
01:36:50,918 --> 01:36:52,805
And after that
you're on your own.

725
01:36:55,398 --> 01:36:57,285
So what do you say?

726
01:36:57,957 --> 01:36:59,518
Do I pull the trigger...

727
01:37:00,198 --> 01:37:01,758
...or do you get your ass
on that plane...

728
01:37:03,078 --> 01:37:04,638
...and have a wonderful life?

729
01:37:09,637 --> 01:37:11,841
How do I know that
you tell the truth?

730
01:37:16,357 --> 01:37:18,245
How do I know there is
a bullet in the chamber?

731
01:37:57,637 --> 01:37:59,841
That sure is pretty.
Where did you get it?

732
01:38:04,998 --> 01:38:07,202
In a curio shop in Belleville.

733
01:38:08,518 --> 01:38:10,722
I got it for my daughter.

734
01:38:11,718 --> 01:38:14,565
I've got a little girl myself.
She'll be ten next June.

735
01:38:16,198 --> 01:38:18,085
Do you remember
the name of the store?

736
01:38:18,757 --> 01:38:20,318
I make a lot of deliveries there.

737
01:38:21,318 --> 01:38:23,838
I'd sure like to get her something
like that for her birthday.

738
01:38:33,318 --> 01:38:35,205
You give this to her.

739
01:38:43,557 --> 01:38:45,761
That's sure nice of you.

740
01:38:47,397 --> 01:38:49,285
She'll just love it.

741
01:38:50,277 --> 01:38:52,165
Its just for a little girl.

742
01:38:52,838 --> 01:38:55,358
When she grows up,
she'll think it's too silly.

743
01:38:55,718 --> 01:38:58,238
So just take it
and hang it right there.

744
01:39:00,037 --> 01:39:03,518
So that, when you're
on the road...

745
01:39:06,118 --> 01:39:08,638
...your little girl will always
be with you.

746
01:39:29,158 --> 01:39:32,224
Sir is not at home
at the moment!

747
01:39:32,358 --> 01:39:34,245
What are you doing,
dodging bill collectors?

748
01:39:34,437 --> 01:39:36,804
- I don't understand.
- Nick, asshole, it's Johnny!

749
01:39:36,998 --> 01:39:38,885
- I know who you are.
- What are you doing?

750
01:39:39,078 --> 01:39:41,183
Well just trying to catch
a little lightning in a bottle.

751
01:39:41,317 --> 01:39:43,106
- Are you eating?
- Barely.

752
01:39:43,237 --> 01:39:45,026
How would you like
to make some real money?

753
01:39:45,157 --> 01:39:48,321
- What are you selling, John?
- You know who Bruce Hewitt Watts is?

754
01:39:49,318 --> 01:39:51,205
- The new American ambassador?
- Bingo.

755
01:39:51,877 --> 01:39:54,943
He's got this wife and three kids but
no one seems to have a picture of them.

756
01:39:55,078 --> 01:39:57,183
Well, yeah maybe they're camera shy?

757
01:39:57,318 --> 01:40:00,482
There are some people, they like
to keep their home life private.

758
01:40:00,838 --> 01:40:02,626
I know that is weird
but they do.

759
01:40:02,758 --> 01:40:05,605
What's happening to you? D'you found
a fucking god? You owe me, pal.

760
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:08,162
Then I guess I have
to keep on owing you.

761
01:40:08,838 --> 01:40:10,245
That's your half.

762
01:40:10,758 --> 01:40:12,645
There it is a little under
four million.

763
01:40:13,957 --> 01:40:17,121
That's the best I could do.
I had to fence them off one at a time.

764
01:40:18,118 --> 01:40:20,638
Sorry that it took so long but
it was the safest way.

765
01:40:21,958 --> 01:40:23,518
Not bad for a night's work, huh?

766
01:40:24,517 --> 01:40:26,078
You call that work?

767
01:40:28,357 --> 01:40:31,205
Goodbye, Laure. It's best
we don't see each other again.

768
01:40:51,557 --> 01:40:53,445
Gather around for the picture!

769
01:41:24,837 --> 01:41:26,724
Let's wait for the sun.

770
01:44:18,757 --> 01:44:21,921
- Excuse me lady, are you all right?
- It was an accident, it was a terr...

771
01:44:27,078 --> 01:44:29,598
Sorry, I'm just so shook up.

772
01:44:36,678 --> 01:44:38,882
Actually, you look like
you need a drink...

773
01:44:40,837 --> 01:44:42,081
A drink?

774
01:44:43,077 --> 01:44:44,484
Yes. Come on.

775
01:44:51,877 --> 01:44:53,284
I'm sorry...

776
01:44:54,117 --> 01:44:55,677
You look so familiar.

777
01:44:56,997 --> 01:44:59,201
Haven't we met before?
Somewhere?

778
01:45:00,517 --> 01:45:02,078
Only in my dreams.
