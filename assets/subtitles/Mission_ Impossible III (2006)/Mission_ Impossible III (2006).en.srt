0,163 --> 00:00:32,631
We've put an explosive charge
in your head.

2
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,533
Does that sound familiar?

3
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,972
The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?

4
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,707
I gave it to you.

5
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,840
Ethan, where's the Rabbit's Foot?

6
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,716
Wait... What are you saying?
That wasn't it?

7
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,486
-What I gave you, was that...
-I'm going to count to 10.

8
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:03,653
You're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is or she dies.

9
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,070
Jules, it's going to be okay.

10
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,835
It's going to be okay.
Do you understand?

11
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,104
One.

12
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,508
You listen to me.
I got exactly what you asked for.

13
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,880
Did you want something else?

14
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,148
If there was a misunderstanding,
I will fix it.

15
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,154
I can get it, whatever you want.

16
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,416
Two.

17
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,951
Listen. Talk to me. We can talk,

18
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,853
Iike gentlemen.

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,790
-Three.
-God!

20
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,604
All right. All right, all right.

21
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,638
I know where the Rabbit's Foot is.

22
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,977
I can help you.

23
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,747
The way you helped me
on the airplane?

24
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,517
That way?

25
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,548
You put the gun down.
I'm not talking to you like this.

26
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,093
That's your choice. Four.

27
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,055
The Rabbit's Foot's in Paris.

28
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,895
You want to know where in Paris?
Then let her go.

29
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,095
-'Cause you will not...
-It's not in Paris. Five.

30
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,633
I can get it for you.

31
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,641
But you kill her, you do this,
you get nothing.

32
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,973
-Six.
-Are you listening to me?

33
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,242
The only way you're going
to get what you want is for you to...

34
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,442
-Do you think I'm playing?
-Son of a bitch!

35
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,883
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

36
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,818
Where is it? Where the hell is it?

37
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,389
-Look at me.
-Where the hell is it?

38
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,890
-Stay with me.
-Seven! Seven!

39
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:44,520
I am going to kill you.
I swear to God I'm going to kill you!

40
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,689
-Eight!
-No, please.

41
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,533
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

42
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,476
I promise you. I promise you.

43
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,242
-I can figure out how to get whatever...
-Nine.

44
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,544
Listen to me. Listen to me.

45
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,018
I want to help you.

46
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,850
I want to help you get
whatever you want.

47
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,656
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

48
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,530
No. No.

49
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,333
No.

50
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,311
-Ten.
-Don't!

51
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:31,868
-Ten.
-Don't!

52
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,083
-What are you doing?
-Your brother wants another one.

53
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,846
Oh, God, no.
Ethan, that's what we talked about...

54
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,921
-I'm watching him. He's fine.
-That's how it is with Rick.

55
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,582
He's fine and then suddenly he's naked
and he's hugging everybody.

56
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,558
-I'll take full responsibility for Rick.
-You will? Full?

57
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,152
-Well, mostly full.
-It's a huge responsibility.

58
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,822
It's going well, right?

59
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,230
-It's going really well.
-Yeah.

60
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,064
Julia, your sister's here.

61
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,972
-Give me a hug.
-You look so beautiful.

62
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,166
I don't know about that. So, is this him?

63
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,904
-I hope so.
-Oh, come here. Oh, gosh.

64
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,576
All right. Mom's dying to see you.

65
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,706
I can't believe
you guys came all the way to Virginia.

66
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,044
Like we'd miss your engagement...

67
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:48,985
When Julia called and told me
that she was getting married,

68
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,091
I had one thought,
that it was just too bad

69
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,458
that Daddy wasn't here
to walk her down the aisle.

70
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,794
And then when Julia told me...
Thanks, Mom.

71
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,367
That Ethan doesn't have
his parents anymore, either,

72
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,265
I got really sad.

73
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,534
But it occurred to me
that this is about starting a new family

74
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,604
and how beautiful that is.

75
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,838
And I just want to say
I am making Julia an aunt,

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,778
so I expect the same treatment
very, very soon.

77
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,145
Cheers!

78
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,153
Department of Transportation?

79
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,453
I've been there over 1 0 years now.
Wow.

80
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,118
What do you do at the DOT?

81
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,752
I study traffic patterns.

82
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,161
You hit the brakes for a second,
just tap them on the freeway,

83
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,131
you can literally track
the ripple effect of that action

84
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,758
across a 200-mile stretch of road,

85
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,166
because traffic has a memory.

86
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,262
It's amazing. It's like a living organism.

87
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,068
Freshen that up for you?
What is it, vodka martini?

88
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,267
Yeah. Thanks.

89
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,310
Ladies, do you need...

90
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,339
-I'd marry him.
-I would, too.

91
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,283
Okay, so, a three-week
heli-boarding honeymoon?

92
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,320
-Okay, you actually get dropped...
-From a helicopter, yeah.

93
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,390
-It's how they met.
-Really?

94
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,356
-Tell her the story.
-There's no story.

95
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,052
It is a good story. Tell the story.

96
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,221
First of all,
no one was ever good enough for Julia.

97
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,559
Oh, here we go.

98
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,602
Not spontaneous enough,
adventurous enough, funny enough...

99
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,501
You know what? No, that's not true.
You make it sound like I've never dated.

100
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,630
No one we liked.

101
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,538
-That is true.
-That is true.

102
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,923
Then she goes and gets in a chopper
that takes off from this lake...

103
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,824
-What was the name of that lake?
-Lake...

104
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,298
Lake Wanaka. Wanaka.

105
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,795
Wanaka. Thank you.

106
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,665
-He heard that?
-How did he hear that?

107
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,740
And the hospital's cool
with you taking three weeks?

108
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,832
Yeah, I'm not the only nurse
employed there, you know.

109
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,800
I'm psyched that you're going
to be my brother, man.

110
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,929
So am l, Rick.

111
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,904
No, it's awesome.
I think it's going to be sick.

112
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,408
Me, too, man.
I just got to get the phone.

113
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,341
-You rock hard.
-Okay.

114
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,471
Hello?

115
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,674
-Is this Mr. Ethan Hunt?
-Yes, it is.

116
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,285
This is Ready-Travel Resort Services.

117
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:38,016
We'd like to offer you a chance to win
an all-expense-paid trip to Mexico.

118
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,734
We ran out of ice.
I'll be back in 1 0 minutes.

119
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,109
-Oh, no. Can't somebody else go?
-No, I got it.

120
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,148
I'll be right back. Hi, Betsy.

121
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,580
Thank you.

122
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,701
$1.86.

123
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,079
Thanks for coming.
Can't decide what size Slurpee to get.

124
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,184
I usually go for the 900-ouncer.

125
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,549
How's that party? Sorry I had to call you.

126
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,648
-Yeah, you should have come.
-You should have invited me.

127
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,125
-You know I would have.
-Thanks.

128
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,725
I know we joke about it, but I am always
this close to begging you

129
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,200
to stop training our people
and get your ass back in the field.

130
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,170
But that's not what you do anymore,
and so I respect that choice.

131
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:04,403
You know I do. Family's everything.

132
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,978
Come on, John. What's going on?

133
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,648
It's Agent Farris.

134
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,279
She was on an operation.

135
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,426
She's disappeared.
Been off-grid 1 1 hours.

136
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:27,065
I'm sending in Search and Rescue.
I was hoping you'd want in.

137
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,203
You've got good people for that.

138
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,837
Yeah. Yep, that we do.

139
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,849
Wheels up at sunrise
if you have a change of heart.

140
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,181
Take some pictures of the party for me.

141
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,635
Ethan. Three days ago,

142
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,233
Agent Lindsey Farris was captured
while on a surveillance operation.

143
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,075
This is the man she was tracking.
His name is Owen Davian.

144
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,478
Details are eyes-only,

145
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,346
but I can tell you
that Davian's a black-market trafficker.

146
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,353
Extremely dangerous
and a priority for us.

147
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,417
At 1 400 hours today,

148
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,684
a recon satellite ID'd
a caravan of vehicles

149
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,421
with plates matching those known to
have been used by Davian's operatives.

150
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,089
They stopped at a derelict factory
outside Berlin.

151
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,464
It appears they have a hostage.
We believe it's Agent Farris.

152
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,662
Normally we would disavow,

153
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,830
but Lindsey may be the key
to getting us closer to Davian,

154
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,635
and that's a risk we need to take.

155
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,438
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

156
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,103
is to find Lindsey and bring her home.

157
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,477
I've already assembled a team.

158
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,478
I have them standing by,
awaiting your word.

159
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:58,553
This message, let's call it
my excellent engagement gift to you,

160
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,718
will self-destruct in five seconds.

161
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,420
Good luck, Ethan, and thanks again.

162
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,539
Am I ready?

163
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,425
-You okay?
-Y eah.

164
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,558
Y eah.

165
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:56,145
You know, I'm sorry. I realized
I didn't tell you that the office called

166
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,449
during the party.
I have to go to Houston for a night.

167
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,454
METRO's having
a public transpo conference.

168
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,017
-It's so last-minute.
-I know.

169
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,383
Well, well, well.

170
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,153
Now, if it isn't
Mr. "Those Who Can't Do, Teach"

171
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,785
back in the field.

172
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,057
-What's up, baby?
-Hey, man.

173
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,459
Hey, Ethan, don't worry.
We're going to get the girl.

174
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:54,734
Or have you been away so long
you've forgotten how good we are?

175
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,667
Welcome back, brother.

176
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,467
Is our truck in place?

177
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,694
Weapons good to go?

178
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,533
-Yeah. You?
-Yeah.

179
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,600
You know I got your six.

180
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,141
Hey, man. That's your job.

181
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,559
Guns one, activated.
Guns two, activated.

182
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,660
Guns three, activated.
Guns four, activated.

183
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,138
Guns ready.

184
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,008
All four guns operational.

185
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,811
They've got men on
the second, third, fourth floors.

186
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,316
I count 14 of them.

187
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,548
Observer, I'm in approach position.

188
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,522
Roger that. Stand by.

189
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,926
Target match.

190
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,933
The prize is on the sixth floor.
Two Tangos with her.

191
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,633
Moving in.

192
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,279
So, Raider One, at some point,

193
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,789
we got to go over
this whole "getting married" thing.

194
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,689
Negative, Observer.

195
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,625
I don't respect you nearly enough
to have that conversation.

196
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,890
You may not respect me,

197
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,125
but for now you're stuck
with my voice in your head.

198
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,134
So, this girl,
what the hell do you see in her anyway?

199
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,399
Who, Julia? You've never met her.

200
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,406
Yeah, and the way things are,
I probably never will.

201
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,578
Lucky for her, right?
That's what you're thinking.

202
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,512
They've got communications gear.

203
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,583
Two Tangos, second floor,
northwest corridor.

204
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,418
Groundhog, that's you.

205
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,146
You need to grab that gear
on the second floor

206
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,619
as soon as we go hot.

207
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,213
Copy that. I'll need two minutes,

208
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,091
which means
you'll need me in one, right?

209
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,751
Yeah, just about.

210
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,193
Raider One,
make a left at the top of the stairs.

211
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,233
The prize should be
at the end of the hall.

212
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,879
Phoenix, I have eye on the prize.

213
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,922
Give her 1 0 cc's more.

214
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,361
-Call me when she wakes.
-Okay.

215
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,061
We need touchdown in less than three.
Do you copy?

216
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,600
Roger that, I copy.

217
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,761
Please, when do I not copy?
All I do is copy.

218
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,475
Stand by to go live. On my mark.

219
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,705
Three.

220
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,872
Two.

221
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,711
One. Execute.

222
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,621
Warning. Warning.

223
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,283
Raider One, you're clear. Move!

224
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,126
Lindsey. Lindsey.

225
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,056
Ethan?

226
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,689
I'm going to get you home.

227
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,501
Observer, I've got the prize.
Evac in three.

228
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,040
Roger that.

229
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,710
This is adrenaline.
Lindsey, you're going to feel this.

230
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,732
Groundhog, second floor is clear.

231
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,337
On the move!

232
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,263
Observer, we're on the move. Wrap out.

233
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,558
-Evac in 90 seconds.
-Roger that.

234
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,429
Phoenix, get to the LZ now.

235
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,729
Roger, Observer. On my way.

236
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,578
Ethan. I have to talk to you.

237
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,589
-Come on, come on.
-I have to talk to you right now!

238
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,785
Just for you. Turn off your transmitter.

239
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,452
Do it, Ethan!

240
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,134
Ethan!

241
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,482
-Lindsey! Moving!
-Moving!

242
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:27,824
Mag!

243
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,791
Ready to move.

244
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,725
We evac from here.

245
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,226
Get down!

246
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,128
I'm out. How many rounds you got?

247
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,803
Enough.

248
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,084
Now I'm out.

249
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,891
T minus five, baby.

250
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,497
Lindsey, hold on to me.

251
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,123
Luther!

252
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,228
Rolling!

253
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,284
God! My head! What is that?

254
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,152
-What is...
-ls she okay?

255
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,390
Lindsey! Let's get to the chopper.

256
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,023
Zhen, get rid of the truck.

257
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,465
Let's go!

258
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,838
God! What is that? You can't hear that?

259
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,745
-Oh! God!
-What's wrong with her?

260
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,578
-Let's go!
-We loaded?

261
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,948
Yeah. Let's do it! Move out!

262
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,289
Go, go, go, go, go!

263
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,811
-Son of a bitch.
-No!

264
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,283
Guys, we got company.
I'm going to try and lose them.

265
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,911
Hurts so much.

266
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,353
Turn it off. Please.

267
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,802
Please, Ethan.

268
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,119
Guys, their missiles are hot!

269
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,625
Incoming! Hold on.

270
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,703
Okay. That was lucky.
We only get one of those.

271
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,081
Do we have a defibrillator?

272
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,021
Ethan, turn it off!

273
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:49,994
Bring it on!

274
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,293
Ethan! What is it?
Did they put something in my head?

275
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,334
They injected you
with a time-release charge.

276
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,960
-Do you remember that?
-No. Time-release...

277
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,435
An explosive. They've activated it.

278
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:01,938
It's gonna detonate
unless we fry the charge,

279
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,200
-which is what we're gonna do.
-No, Ethan.

280
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,673
Zap her like that, you'll stop her heart.

281
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,336
Then I'll zap her again
and bring her back.

282
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,538
Do it!

283
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,740
Guys! They're firing another one!

284
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,184
-Ethan!
-Zhen!

285
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,760
Zhen, hold on. Hold on, hold on!

286
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,479
-I want you to set it for 150.
-150.

287
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,315
Lindsey, I'm gonna short out
the explosive in your head.

288
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,389
-You're gonna be okay.
-lt'll need 30 seconds.

289
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,954
Damn it.

290
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,256
-Twenty-five seconds!
-Come on.

291
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,158
We're almost there.

292
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,734
-They have us locked.
-Twenty seconds.

293
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,665
Hold on.

294
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,016
I got them!

295
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,590
-Ten seconds.
-Almost there. Almost there.

296
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,282
Give me the paddles.

297
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,862
Ethan. Thank you.

298
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,160
Shit.

299
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,395
Hey.

300
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,299
Hey.

301
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,405
How did it go?

302
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,914
I'm sorry. Fine. I'm sorry.

303
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,149
I'm just tired.

304
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,749
I read your training brief
on Agent Farris.

305
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,290
The words you used were
"beyond capable."

306
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,791
That still stand, Mr. Hunt?

307
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,226
-Mr. Brassel...
-Does it stand?

308
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,191
Yes, sir, it does.

309
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,529
Because we've got a corpse downstairs
that says otherwise.

310
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,296
Killed by a detonator

311
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,634
implanted in her skull
through the nasal cavity.

312
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,971
Mr. Brassel, it's unacceptable to judge
Agent Farris' competence based...

313
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,171
It's unacceptable
that chocolate makes you fat,

314
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,305
but I've eaten my share.
And guess what?

315
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,748
Now, I approved Agent Farris'
surveillance op

316
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,978
based on your evaluations, Mr. Hunt,

317
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,520
of a woman
who allowed herself to be captured.

318
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,592
So you go to recover her.
You encounter a dozen men.

319
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,354
You don't grab any of them?

320
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:20,090
Our objective, Mr. Brassel,
was to recover Agent Farris.

321
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,193
Davian employs a cellular structure
at his organization.

322
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,360
The men there
more than likely had no information...

323
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,462
Who's drawing these conclusions?
Is it you?

324
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:31,734
-I am, sir. Based upon...
-I'm not on you yet.

325
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,945
You allowed Farris
to board your chopper without a scan.

326
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,105
That explosive device
could have taken you all out.

327
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:41,675
There is one reason that you are sitting
here before me today, and that is luck.

328
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,086
Because your operation was
poorly conceived and executed worse.

329
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,523
-Two laptops were recovered...
-I'm aware of that.

330
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,957
We've talked to Tech Services.

331
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,427
They doubt
if they can reconstitute the drives.

332
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,795
"Crispy," I believe,
is what they called them. Worthless.

333
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,198
Mr. Brassel,
as Operation Manager of this office,

334
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,736
-I have the authority...
-Excuse me.

335
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,864
Did you just throw a title at me,
Mr. Musgrave?

336
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,340
I don't care if your daddy plays golf
with the President.

337
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,538
This is lntelligence.
So far I haven't seen any.

338
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,809
You think this op was worth the risk,
Mr. Hunt.

339
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,346
What do you know about Owen Davian?

340
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,947
He was the one
who brought gas centrifuge technology

341
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,117
to Korea from Pakistan.

342
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:26,391
He was also the man who sold Toxin
Five to the Armahad Republic Jihad.

343
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:31,063
He is a man who provides,
provides, provides!

344
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:36,066
And he remains invisible.
He's a goddamn invisible man.

345
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,142
Wells, not Ellison,
in case you want to be cute again.

346
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,007
We can't find him.

347
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,581
He knows it. It's emboldened him.

348
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,478
I've been trying to bring Davian down
since the day that I got here.

349
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:50,781
Do you know what I've got for it?

350
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,119
It's never been confirmed
the Toxin Five theft was Davian.

351
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:57,251
Mr. Musgrave, please don't interrupt me
when I'm asking rhetorical questions.

352
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,455
Your operation has achieved one thing.

353
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,761
You have reminded Davian
that he is winning.

354
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,261
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go inform Mr. and Mrs. Farris

355
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:11,240
that their baby girl was killed
in a head-on collision on l-95.

356
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,836
I stand here today deeply saddened

357
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,911
by the death of one of God's children,

358
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,748
Lindsey Elizabeth Farris.

359
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:27,288
It is always startling when the Lord
takes one of our young so unexpectedly.

360
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:33,454
Be aggressive. Come on. Stay focused.
Keep your knees bent. Good. Good.

361
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,657
Now, to fire the lock,
the extractor has to be...

362
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,701
That bag's not going to hit you back.
Hit harder.

363
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,202
Don't rely on your sights.
Keep your eyes dead on the target...

364
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,897
Attack me. Come on.

365
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,134
Don't ever release the firing pin
unless the extractor's...

366
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,302
Good. There you go. Good.

367
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:51,911
Identify the target. Point and shoot.
It's very simple. You point and shoot.

368
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,108
Stay focused.

369
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:56,210
Miss Farris, you know
how many recruits I've trained.

370
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,186
I'm proud to say that you are the first

371
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,917
that I've recommended
for active field duty.

372
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,390
Congratulations.

373
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:03,892
Am I ready?

374
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,193
Y es?

375
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,366
Is this Mr. Kelvin?

376
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,770
Y es. Who is this?

377
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,208
I'm calling from Norfolk Mail Service.

378
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,745
Lindsey Farris
rents a post office box here.

379
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,474
She sent you a piece of mail from Berlin

380
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,482
and asked us to call you
when it arrived.

381
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,449
It came this morning.

382
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,155
Thank you.

383
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,055
-This right here.
-Thanks.

384
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:58,750
It's a microdot.

385
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:58,772
It's a microdot.

386
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,181
A microdot with nothing on it.
This is unusual.

387
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,277
Lindsey wouldn't send me
a blank microdot.

388
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,946
I'm telling you, man, there's no image.

389
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,387
Then you're not looking
in the right place.

390
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,958
Where the hell am I supposed to look?

391
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,526
There's not much square footage
to this thing.

392
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,060
Why would Lindsey send me
a blank microdot?

393
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,925
I don't know.
Why would Lindsey send you anything?

394
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,693
You were her instructor,
not her handler.

395
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,427
Listen, man.
I don't mean to cross the line,

396
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:23,469
but was there something going on
between you two?

397
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,269
You and Lindsey.

398
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,301
Lindsey was like my little sister.

399
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,347
And you never

400
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,180
slept with your little sister, right?

401
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,951
Hey, brother, if I don't ask you, who will?

402
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,549
Maybe it's magnetic. The microdot.

403
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,055
Well, that's old school.

404
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:48,654
If she was in a hurry and only had
access to black-market gear, maybe.

405
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,996
-Could you get the tools to read it?
-I might know a guy.

406
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,502
-Magnetic means encrypted.
-Yeah, I know that.

407
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,266
Yeah. Be right there.

408
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,576
The thing about Lindsey is
she was brand-new.

409
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,839
She was sweet.
Remember when you were sweet?

410
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:06,474
-Can you remember that far back?
-Yeah, well, barely.

411
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:10,342
In Germany,
you asked me what it is I see in Julia.

412
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,881
What I see in Julia is life before all this.

413
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,353
And it's good.

414
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,129
Benji, what have you got?

415
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,461
Well, these hard drive platters
are just fried.

416
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,330
-Yeah.
-You know, they made a mess of them.

417
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,834
It's just like...
There's holes in them and stuff.

418
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,837
And it's got scorched
all the way through. And then...

419
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,497
Look, this one's got
a hole in it and stuff.

420
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:30,869
I can't believe. I can't even look at it.

421
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,170
-Benji. Did you recover anything?
-Yes. Yes.

422
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:36,178
Despite the aforementioned conditions
of the hard drive you brought back,

423
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,842
I managed to recover
portions of two dozen e-mail files.

424
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,476
Also made what I believe to be

425
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,556
a thoroughly
promotion-worthy breakthrough.

426
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,450
Your Mr. Davian is going
to arrive in Rome the day after tomorrow

427
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,586
and attend a function
at one Vatican City.

428
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,857
What the hell is Davian
doing at the Vatican?

429
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,991
It's all got to do with the "Rabbit's Foot."

430
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,193
Rabbit's Foot?

431
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,997
Yeah, well,
I'm assuming it's like a code word

432
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,231
for something he's about to sell
to an unspecified buyer,

433
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,935
for $850 million, by the way.
Or maybe it's not a code word.

434
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,739
Maybe it's just a really,
really expensive bunny appendage.

435
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:10,370
You have no idea what it is?

436
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,211
It's interesting. I used to have
this professor at Oxford, okay?

437
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:16,411
Dr. Wickham, his name was,
and he was like this massive, fat guy.

438
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,887
You know, huge, big guy.
We used to call him...

439
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,753
You know... Well, I won't tell you
what we used to call him.

440
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,588
He taught biomolecular kinetics
and cellular dynamics,

441
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,719
and he used to sort of
scare the underclassmen

442
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,993
with this story about how the world
would eventually be eviscerated

443
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,431
by technology.

444
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,993
You see, it was inevitable
that a compound would be created,

445
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,629
which he referred to as the "Anti-God."

446
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,004
It was like an accelerated mutator,
a sort of, you know,

447
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,170
Iike an unstoppable force
of destructive power

448
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,042
that would just lay waste to everything.

449
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,343
To buildings and parks
and streets and children

450
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,942
and ice cream parlors, you know?

451
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,917
So whenever I see, like,
a rogue organization,

452
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:55,686
willing to spend this amount of money
on a mystery tech,

453
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:59,160
I always assume it's the Anti-God.

454
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,527
End-of-the-world kind of stuff,
you know?

455
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,432
But, no, I don't have any idea what it is.
I was just speculating.

456
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,905
-Did you brief Musgrave on this?
-Who, me? No, not yet.

457
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,669
-Good. Don't.
-What?

458
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,539
-Don't tell anyone about this.
-This took me ages.

459
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,044
If something goes wrong
with the operation,

460
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,581
I want Musgrave to have deniability.

461
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,277
-That's great work, Benji.
-What operation?

462
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,554
That look in your eye
is a pain in my ass.

463
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,520
You know that, right?

464
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,489
Any available resident to Pediatrics.

465
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,891
Any available resident to Pediatrics.

466
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,564
Rehabilitative Care, call the pharmacy.

467
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,362
Rehabilitative Care, call the...

468
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,366
I have to go away again.

469
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,841
On business. Two days.

470
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,546
Two days?

471
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,777
Yeah.

472
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,393
Ethan, what's going on?

473
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,587
I keep thinking you just need time

474
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,934
to tell me whatever it is that it's...

475
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,535
But nothing in my mind makes sense.

476
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,406
Yeah.

477
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,941
What's wrong?

478
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,192
What are you not telling me?

479
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,120
I need to ask you for something.

480
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,659
And it's the most...

481
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,931
I need you to trust me.

482
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,507
Of course I trust you.

483
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:34,577
Am I ever going to be able
to understand what this is?

484
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,013
I need you to trust me.

485
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,323
Yes.

486
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,166
I trust you.

487
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,531
Is it...

488
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,336
Tell me it's real.

489
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,212
I mean us.

490
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,511
Tell me it's real.

491
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,686
Follow me.

492
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,556
The vows you're about to take

493
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,220
are not to be taken
without careful thought and prayer.

494
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,298
This love is not to be diminished
by difficult circumstances

495
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,495
and it is only to be dissolved by death.

496
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,371
Do you have the rings?

497
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,801
Yeah.

498
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,918
Repeat after me.

499
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,996
I, Julia Anne Meade...

500
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,262
"l, Julia Anne Meade..."

501
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,832
...hereby take Ethan Matthew Hunt...

502
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,540
"...hereby take Ethan Matthew Hunt..."

503
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,340
...to be my lawfully wedded husband.

504
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,413
"...to be my lawfully wedded husband."

505
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,733
Tomorrow may be the only time
we can predict

506
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,396
where Owen Davian is going to be.

507
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,030
Charity event. Vatican City.

508
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:40,133
Our mission is to get in
and kidnap Davian.

509
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,643
I don't know why he's so happy.

510
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,245
I did remind him
that the Vatican is the Vatican.

511
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:50,452
A 109-acre sovereign state
in the middle of Rome,

512
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:54,149
surrounded by a 60-foot wall,
which is monitored 24/7,

513
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,725
with over 200 CCTV cameras.

514
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,328
That's not even
what makes it a challenge.

515
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:04,629
Getting Davian is good.
But getting his buyers is even better.

516
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,794
If they realize he's been grabbed,
they'll disappear.

517
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,964
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

518
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,405
No matter how we grab Davian,

519
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,341
his clients are gonna know
he's been taken.

520
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,278
No, they won't. Access point is here.

521
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:20,674
It's a one-way street
adjacent to the Vatican wall.

522
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,981
I'll need 30 seconds.
And we'll need a truck.

523
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,649
Now we've pissed off
every ltalian in Rome,

524
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,818
go do what you got to do.

525
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,294
-Don't forget the smoke.
-Yeah.

526
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:49,702
"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall."
