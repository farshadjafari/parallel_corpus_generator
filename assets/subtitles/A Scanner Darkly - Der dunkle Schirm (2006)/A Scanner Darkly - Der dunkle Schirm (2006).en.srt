1
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,290
I looked them up.

2
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:04,871
They're aphids.

3
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:08,545
They're in my hair, on my skin,
in my lungs.

4
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:12,050
And the pain, Barris, it's unreasonable.

5
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:13,879
They're all over the place.

6
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:18,890
<i>-They've completely gotten Millie too.
-Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.</i>

7
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:22,512
Listen, you gotta get out of there.
I'll meet you over at Joe's Cafe at 3.

8
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:24,432
Calm down, everything's gonna be fine.

9
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:27,312
Put a couple of them in a jar
so I can get them examined.

10
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:29,520
I'm sure they're aphids,
but you never know.

11
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:33,278
Just in case, okay? Just do it.
Relax, relax.

12
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:59,390
Gentlemen of the Anaheim 709th chapter
of the Brown Bear Lodge...

13
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,967
...we have a wonderful opportunity
this afternoon.

14
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:04,602
The county of Orange has provided us
with a chance...

15
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:07,561
...to hear from and put questions to...

16
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:11,436
...an undercover narcotics agent
who is out there on our behalf...

17
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:13,985
...fighting this awful
Substance D epidemic.

18
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,994
It's no secret we're living
in a culture of addiction.

19
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:21,028
Nearly 20 percent of the population
can now be classified as addicts.

20
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:23,877
And as far as anyone can tell,
there is but one company...

21
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:26,961
...that is working and helping
this situation.

22
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:30,332
That company is our sponsor, New Path.

23
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:38,930
You will notice
you can barely see this man...

24
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,266
...because he is wearing
what is called a scramble suit. 

25
00:04:42,437 --> 00:04:45,225
The exact same suit he wears
and, in fact, must wear...

26
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,641
...during certain parts,
in fact, most parts...

27
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:50,106
...of his daily activities
of law enforcement.

28
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:53,691
This man, whom we will call Fred
because that is the code name...

29
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:56,237
...under which he reports
information he gathers...

30
00:04:56,451 --> 00:04:59,072
...once within the scramble suit,
cannot be detected...

31
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:02,449
...by even the latest in
voice- and facial-recognition technology.

32
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,079
The scramble suit itself
is purportedly made up...

33
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:09,201
...of approximately a million and a half
fraction-representations...

34
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:13,425
...of men, women, and children
in every variant...

35
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:17,757
...making the wearer of a scramble suit
the ultimate Everyman.

36
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:19,805
This is terrible.

37
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:23,346
He looks, does he not,
like a constantly shifting, vague blur...

38
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:25,478
...and nothing more, am I right?

39
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,848
Let's hear it for the vague blur.

40
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:40,370
lf you saw me on the street
without this suit on, you'd say:

41
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:43,242
There goes a total dope fiend. 

42
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:46,038
You'd feel aversion and walk away.

43
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:49,213
I don't look like you. I can't afford to.

44
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,040
My life depends on it.

45
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:55,420
I'm not going to tell you first
what I do as an undercover officer...

46
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:58,928
...tracking down dealers and the source
of their illegal drugs...

47
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:02,134
...in the streets of our cities
and corridors of our schools...

48
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,387
...here in Orange County.

49
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:07,392
I'm going to tell you what I'm afraid of.

50
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:10,521
What I fear, night and day,
is that our children...

51
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,694
...your children and my children--

52
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:18,076
I have two little ones, very little...

53
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:20,781
...but not too little to be addicted.

54
00:06:20,954 --> 00:06:26,079
Calculatedly addicted to Substance D
for profit by drug terrorists.

55
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:29,576
As many of you know,
our military and their associates...

56
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,747
...are actively engaged in countries...

57
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:35,009
...where it is believed
the organic component of Substance D...

58
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:39,086
...a small, highly toxic flower, originates.

59
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:44,055
And while our troops are down there
fighting for us...

60
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:47,644
...it is up to each and every
one of us here...

61
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:52,442
...to do our part in eliminating
the demand for this drug.

62
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,281
It's important you as citizens
continue to report...

63
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:59,316
...all suspicious activity and individuals...

64
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:03,706
...for, simply put, if there were
no demand in our society...

65
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:07,242
...there would be no market
for these leeches to exploit.

66
00:07:13,675 --> 00:07:16,461
Each day, this disease
takes its toll on us.

67
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,634
And each day, the flow of profits
and where they go... .

68
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:29,262
Well, it isn't about the profits anyhow,
it's something else.

69
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,901
What'd you see happen?

70
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,490
lf you were a diabetic
and you didn't have money for insulin...

71
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,151
...would you steal to get the money
or just die?

72
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,615
<i>I think you better go back to the,
you know, prepared text there, Fred.</i>

73
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,500
I forgot it.
I think I have a block against this shit.

74
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,043
<i>Repeat after me,
but make it sound casual.</i>

75
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,841
<i>Where the profits flow,
we will s--</i>

76
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:03,514
<i>--and then
retribution will swiftly follow.</i>

77
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:07,184
<i>At that moment, I would not
want to be in their shoes.  Got it?</i>

78
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:10,605
You know why I've got a block
against this bullshit?

79
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:13,610
Because this is what gets people
on drugs.

80
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:17,396
It's all so disgusting you want to
lurch off and become a user.

81
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:20,408
<i>Come on, Fred, just say this shit
and get it over with.</i>

82
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,035
Anyway... .

83
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:33,043
Substance D.

84
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:34,709
D.

85
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:39,885
D is for dumbness and despair
and desertion.

86
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:44,100
The desertion of your friends from you,
you from your friends.

87
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:46,225
Everyone from everyone.

88
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:50,264
Isolation and loneliness...

89
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:55,193
...and hating and suspecting each other.

90
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,730
D is, finally, death.

91
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:02,570
Slow death.

92
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:05,821
From the head down.

93
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:13,417
Well, that's it.

94
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:24,386
Okay, let's eat.

95
00:09:40,115 --> 00:09:41,658
All right, what's your name?

96
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:44,446
My name... .

97
00:09:46,163 --> 00:09:48,620
You don't know your name?
Well, that's interesting.

98
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:51,909
Probable cause. Out of the car, sir.

99
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:55,787
Now, you have the right
to remain silent until... .

100
00:09:56,424 --> 00:10:02,544
And... . And anything you say can and
will be used against you when you... .

101
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:04,764
When what?

102
00:10:04,932 --> 00:10:06,972
You know, fuck this shit.

103
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,937
-Hello?
-Hey, how you doing?

104
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:37,350
Oh, I'm all right.

105
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:39,395
<i>Anything wrong?</i>

106
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,525
Just this fucker stole 50 bucks' worth
of shit from us today.

107
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:47,073
<i>My boss said it was somehow my fault,
and it's coming out of my paycheck...</i>

108
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:52,832
<i>... which I don 't even think is legal.
I mean, can he legally do that?</i>

109
00:11:53,001 --> 00:11:54,200
<i>Yeah, they can 't do that.</i>

110
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:59,466
<i>At least, they used to not
be able to do that. I'll check.</i>

111
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:02,755
<i>Hey, Donna,
can I get anything from you?</i>

112
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:05,630
<i>Yeah, how much?</i>

113
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:07,764
<i>-Ten.
-Ten?</i>

114
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:11,100
<i>Yeah, I'm hurting really bad.
I'll pay you back later.</i>

115
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:16,561
<i>-Yeah, okay. Say, day after tomorrow?
-Any sooner?</i>

116
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:19,605
<i>I'll come by later, like around 8?</i>

117
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:21,273
<i>Yeah. I'll see you later.</i>

118
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,113
<i>-Okay. All right, bye.
-Okay, bye.</i>

119
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:32,495
You see, all symptoms are purposeful,
be they positive or negative.

120
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,783
You see?
I wouldn't feel strangely about it.

121
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:37,879
Just the idea of turning yourself
over for rehabilitation...

122
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,716
...is only naturally gonna make you
a little apprehensive.

123
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:43,552
But that's just a manifestation
of the fear.

124
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,389
It's just the:
That's the D talking.

125
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:50,304
You know, the first thing I hear,
that when you go into the New Path...

126
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:52,967
...what they do to you,
they cut your pecker off.

127
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,148
They could never get away with that.
You kidding? That's a myth.

128
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:59,152
It's actually the spleen
that's remanded to their custody.

129
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,477
-The what?
-Hey, how is everything?

130
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:02,984
Everything is super good.

131
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,490
Not with me.
I got a lot of problems nobody else has.

132
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,866
No, no, come on.
More people than you'd think.

133
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,322
And more people each day. This is
a world getting progressively worse.

134
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,697
Can we not agree on that?

135
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,293
-What's on the dessert menu?
-Would you like to order some dessert?

136
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,923
Like what?

137
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,505
Well, we have fresh strawberry pie...

138
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:28,177
...and fresh peach pie
that we make here ourselves.

139
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:35,177
-No, we don't want any dessert.
-All right.

140
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:38,274
Fucking fruit pies are for old ladies.

141
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,695
-What do you think about New Path?
-While it doesn't matter...

142
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,697
...what I think, I kind of
have to tip my hat to any entity...

143
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,154
...that can bring
so much integrity to evil.

144
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,778
I mean, imagine this:
A seemingly voluntary, privatized gulag...

145
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:55,084
...managed to eliminate the middlemen
of public accountability and free will.

146
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,375
Wrapped it up in a bow
and gave it like a gift.

147
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,371
I mean, come on, this is:

148
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,716
This is awe-inspiring stuff.

149
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,552
I heard you have to go cold turkey.

150
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,306
Cold turkey doesn't even apply
to Substance D.

151
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,802
Unlike the legacy
of inherited predisposition...

152
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,020
...to addictive behavior
or substances...

153
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,730
...this needs no genetic assistance.

154
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,230
There's no weekend warriors on the D.
You're either on it...

155
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:26,908
...or you haven't tried it.

156
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,614
-Well, I like it.
-Yeah.

157
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,038
How many caps do you take per day?

158
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,253
Very difficult to determine.

159
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,915
But not that many.

160
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:45,923
Well, like the old-school pharmacopoeia,
a tolerance develops, you know.

161
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:49,595
These visions of bugs,
they're just garden-variety psychosis...

162
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,971
...but a clear indication
that you've hurdled...

163
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:55,642
...over the initial fun and euphoric phase
and passed on...

164
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:58,556
...to the next phase.

165
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:02,441
News from the guinea-pig grapevine
suggests that whatever it is...

166
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:06,062
...we won't know
until it's way too late, you see?

167
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,110
You see that we're all canaries
in the coalmine on this one?

168
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,990
I do think I have another source.

169
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:14,120
That Donna chick.

170
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,116
-Bob's girl?
-Yeah.

171
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:20,076
Yeah, his girl. Although I know
for a fact he never gets in her pants.

172
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,046
Really?

173
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:26,135
-But he talks like he does.
-Oh, yeah.

174
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:28,971
That's Bob Arctor.
He talks like he does many things.

175
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,926
That's not the same, my friend.
That's not the same thing.

176
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,018
Donna has an aversion to bodily contact.

177
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:38,140
I mean, junkies lose their interest in sex,
you realize...

178
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:41,649
...due to organs swelling up
from vasoconstriction.

179
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:46,695
And I have observed in her
an inordinate failure of sexual arousal...

180
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:49,153
...not just toward Bob Arctor...

181
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:52,827
...but other males as well.

182
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:55,831
I can't believe she doesn't put out.

183
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,293
Well, she would
if she were handled right.

184
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:05,131
For instance, I could show you
how to sleep with her...

185
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:07,258
...for less than 3 dollars.

186
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:12,674
I don't wanna sleep with her.
I wanna buy from her.

187
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:15,053
Donna does coke, all right?

188
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:17,303
Three dollars doesn't get you
a line of coke.

189
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,890
That's where you're wrong, pal.

190
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:08,364
What they've deliberately done...

191
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:11,318
...is mix the cocaine with the oil
so it cannot be extracted.

192
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:15,112
But my knowledge of chemistry
is such...

193
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:20,710
...that I know precisely how to
separate the oil from the cocaine.

194
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:24,708
Now, now I will freeze it.

195
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:29,425
Cause cocaine crystals to rise to the top
because they are lighter than the oil.

196
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:33,010
The terminal step, of course,
I keep to myself, but suffice to say...

197
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:37,927
...it involves an intricate and
methodological process of filtering.

198
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:41,596
How long is it gonna be in there?

199
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:43,683
Just about a half an hour.

200
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:46,231
You know, I've been thinking, Barris.

201
00:17:46,403 --> 00:17:50,449
Even if we do get a pure gram of cocaine
out of this deal...

202
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:53,403
...I don't wanna use it on Donna
to get in her pants.

203
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:56,115
-That'd be like buying her.
-No, it'd be an exchange.

204
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:58,697
You give her a gift,
and she gives you one.

205
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:06,454
Besides, we're talking about
Bob's girl here.

206
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:08,967
And this is his house. He's my friend.

207
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,673
He lets you and Luckman live here.

208
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:16,971
There's a great deal about Bob Arctor
you're not aware of.

209
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:24,771
How did New Path rig it?

210
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:28,109
They're the one place in our entire
country that can't be scanned.

211
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,605
All the rest of us can be tracked
24 hours a day...

212
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:32,776
...but no, not at New Path.

213
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:35,490
Hey, that's their contract
with the government.

214
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,457
But I think you're right, it would be
a good place for a dealer to hide.

215
00:18:42,836 --> 00:18:45,624
What about Donna Hawthorne?

216
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:49,461
I'm systematically working up
to her supplier.

217
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:53,170
The quantities I'm buying now
are basically beyond her capacity.

218
00:18:53,347 --> 00:18:55,673
She doesn't have
enough front money to handle it.

219
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:59,468
Matter of time before she's hooking me
up with the next person up the ladder.

220
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:02,136
I think soon we'll have somebody
who knows something...

221
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:03,856
...and they'll be worth busting.

222
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,855
What about Jim Barris
and Ernie Luckman?

223
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:09,319
Same shit. Nothing new.

224
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:13,356
Well, what about Charles Freck
and Robert Arctor?

225
00:19:14,827 --> 00:19:17,828
-Up to pretty much the same old thing.
-Even Arctor?

226
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,540
Arctor?

227
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:24,788
Yeah, he doesn't seem
to be doing much.

228
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:28,498
Still working his nowhere,
Handy Brake and Tire job.

229
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:31,961
Drops a few caps of Death
cut with meth during the day.

230
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:33,548
I'm not so sure.

231
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:35,714
We just got a tip in from an informant...

232
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:38,180
...that Arctor has funds
above and beyond...

233
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:41,057
...what he gets from his little job.

234
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,890
And when we checked into it...

235
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:46,398
...we found he wasn't even
working there full-time.

236
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:48,564
Yeah.

237
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:51,195
Who's this informant?

238
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:52,563
We don't know.

239
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:56,240
Undoubtedly it's a vengeance burn.
That's how these druggies are.

240
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:59,911
I mean, phoning in on each other
every time they get pissed off.

241
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,826
Anyhow, as of now...

242
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,954
...I'm officially assigning you
to observe Arctor.

243
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:10,922
lf we're ever gonna get to the bottom
of this, it'll be through this guy.

244
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,594
So will that mean
full-time viewer recording?

245
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:16,637
We got no choice.

246
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:19,096
We'll install a new
holographic scanning system.

247
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,557
You'll let us know
when they're out of the house.

248
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:24,599
We'll want storage and printout
on everything.

249
00:20:28,153 --> 00:20:33,989
Total, total, total, totally,
total, total, total providence.

250
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,409
I am walking home,
I find myself on a street I am rarely on...

251
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:40,746
...and look what I obtain for a mere $50.

252
00:20:40,915 --> 00:20:43,869
-What is it?
-Oh, this would be an 18-speed bike...

253
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,586
...of the all-terrain variety.

254
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:49,454
I noticed it in a neighbor's yard,
and I inquired as to its availability.

255
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,958
They had four of them.
So I made a cash offer.

256
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:55,634
-Don't. Drugs.
-Fifty dollars. They acquiesced.

257
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:57,882
They threw in these
lemon-yellow racing pants.

258
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:01,509
Even hoisted it over the fence for me,
which I found to be very neighborly.

259
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:06,266
That's weird. I didn't know you could
get a 18-speed bike nearly new for $50.

260
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,647
It's amazing what you can get for $50.

261
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:11,275
I'll give you 60 right now,
no questions asked.

262
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:13,818
You know,
this bike looks a lot like the bike...

263
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,941
...that this girl lives across the street
had that got ripped off a month ago.

264
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,496
This bike could be hot.

265
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:22,333
They probably jacked it,
these hoister friends of yours.

266
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,038
Sure did, if they've got four
and selling it that cheap.

267
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:29,125
Right? You should at least show it to her
so she could see if it's hers.

268
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:30,626
Yeah. Okay, I can do that...

269
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,753
...but this is a boy's bike, okay?
So it can't be.

270
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:37,344
Not to invalidate your intuition,
but it's not possible. Thank you.

271
00:21:37,515 --> 00:21:41,015
Why do you say it's an 18-speed
when it only has nine gears?

272
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,978
Huh, what?

273
00:21:43,145 --> 00:21:46,846
Yeah. Yeah. Six right here,
three at the other end of the chain.

274
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:49,693
Six plus three equals nine.

275
00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:53,695
-It's a nine-speed bike.
-Yeah, but even a nine-speed bike...

276
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:56,355
...for 50 bucks. He still got a good deal.

277
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,532
Okay, those guys told me
it was 18 speeds.

278
00:21:58,702 --> 00:22:00,695
I just got Greeked. I just got... .

279
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:02,663
Wait. Wait.

280
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,950
Now I count eight.

281
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:07,414
Six here and then two in the front.

282
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:09,913
-That makes eight.
-What do you think happened...

283
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:12,047
-...to the missing gears?
-Think? I know.

284
00:22:12,217 --> 00:22:14,423
They were working
on it, these gypsy grifters...

285
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:16,718
...with improper tools,
no technical knowledge.

286
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:18,761
No understanding of reverse engineering.

287
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:21,602
When they attempted to reassemble it,
they panicked.

288
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:23,974
They left nine orphan gears there
on the floor.

289
00:22:24,145 --> 00:22:25,936
They're still there
on the garage floor.

290
00:22:26,105 --> 00:22:28,432
Let's just go rescue
the orphan gears, dude!

291
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,395
Don't you see
that that's part of the plan?

292
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:34,275
They're going to try to sell them to me,
not give them...

293
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:38,660
...as they rightfully should have as
included in part of the original sale price.

294
00:22:38,827 --> 00:22:42,161
Oh, my God, there's no telling
what else they've bait-and-switched.

295
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,580
Yeah, but if all of us go together,
oh, they'll give them back.

296
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,076
Oh, you bet they will.
Oh, you bet they will.

297
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:51,088
-Let's just go as a team, okay.
-Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

298
00:22:51,423 --> 00:22:54,377
Are you sure there are only nine gears
on this bike?

299
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:57,424
-Eight.
-Okay, eight, nine, whatever.

300
00:22:57,596 --> 00:23:02,222
Don't you think that before we go over
and accuse, and start some shit...

301
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:03,804
...we should find out for sure?

302
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:06,433
Right, Donna.
Who do we know who's an authority...

303
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:08,314
...on this type of bi--?

304
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:11,436
Get off me!

305
00:23:11,611 --> 00:23:13,270
Let me--

306
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:16,400
We are all way too close to this.

307
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:18,865
There's only one thing we can do...

308
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:21,952
...to thwart these albino,
shape-shifting lizard bitches.

309
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:24,909
We are gonna take this outside,
ask the first person we see.

310
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,250
Introduce some novelty.
That way we get an objective viewpoint.

311
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,617
Yeah.

312
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:33,295
By the way, I might take you up
on that $60 offer.

313
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:34,961
No, that was for an 18-speed.

314
00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:37,625
You know, for this, 18 minus 10,
I'll give you 23.75.

315
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:40,846
Are you certain
that's the right math on that?

316
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:43,595
Come in.

317
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:49,471
You are Officer Fred?

318
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:53,098
-Yes.
-Have a seat, please.

319
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,819
All right, Fred.

320
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:03,952
We're going to administer
several tests...

321
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:06,952
...and there will be no
physical discomfort involved.

322
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:10,041
lf this is about the speech I gave to the--

323
00:24:10,212 --> 00:24:13,546
What this is about stems from
a recent departmental survey...

324
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:16,289
...showing that undercover agents
have been admitted...

325
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:19,672
...to neural-aphasia clinics
during the last month.

326
00:24:19,846 --> 00:24:23,097
You're conscious of the high factor
of addictiveness of Substance D?

327
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:24,382
Of course I am.

328
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:27,348
Of course,
these tests in no way pertain...

329
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:30,891
...to the addictive properties
of Substance D, but to... .

330
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:34,519
Well, let's start
with the set-ground test first.

331
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:40,189
Within the apparently meaningless lines
is an object that we would all recognize.

332
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:44,698
You are to tell me what that object is
and point to it in the total field.

333
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:46,663
In many of those taking Substance D...

334
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:50,333
...a split between the right and the left
hemisphere of the brain occurs...

335
00:24:50,503 --> 00:24:54,417
...which results in a defect within both
the percept and cognitive systems.

336
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,711
Although apparently the cognitive
continues to function normally.

337
00:24:57,885 --> 00:25:00,259
You located the familiar object
in this drawing?

338
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:03,301
It should just jump right out at you.

339
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:06,561
I see a Coke bottle.

340
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:09,682
A soda-pop bottle is correct.

341
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:11,429
Was it in the speech I gave?

342
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:15,059
Maybe it seemed I showed
a little bilateral dysfunction there.

343
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:19,898
I mean, might have seemed
a little slushed.

344
00:25:20,076 --> 00:25:22,614
Are you getting any cross-chatter?

345
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:28,659
-What?
-Cross-chatter between hemispheres.

346
00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:30,791
lf there's damage to
the left hemisphere...

347
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:33,000
...where the linguistic skills
are located...

348
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:37,086
...then sometimes the right hemisphere
will fill in to the best of its ability.

349
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:42,252
I don't know.
I mean, not that I'm aware of.

350
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:46,382
What do you see in this second picture?

351
00:25:50,731 --> 00:25:51,977
A sheep.

352
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:56,563
Show me the sheep.

353
00:25:57,447 --> 00:25:59,689
An impairment of set-background
discrimination...

354
00:25:59,865 --> 00:26:02,273
...can get you into a heap of trouble.

355
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:07,244
Instead of perceiving no forms,
you perceive faulty forms.

356
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:10,950
So there is no sheep here, is there?

357
00:26:12,753 --> 00:26:13,951
Was I close?

358
00:26:14,131 --> 00:26:16,799
This is not a Rorschach test,
where some abstract blot...

359
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:19,423
...can be interpreted many ways
by many subjects.

360
00:26:19,595 --> 00:26:21,586
This has one specific object.

361
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:25,631
In this case, a dog.

362
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:28,136
A dog.

363
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:32,310
What's that mean,
that I saw a sheep instead?

364
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:35,056
Who knows.
Only after the entire set has been run...

365
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:38,153
-...can we determine--
-Why this is superior to the Rorschach...

366
00:26:38,322 --> 00:26:39,651
...is it's not interpretive.

367
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:42,859
There are many wrongs,
but there is only one right.

368
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,529
You either get it or you don't.

369
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,862
And if you show a run of not getting it...

370
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,494
...then we have a fix on
a functional impairment...

371
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:53,000
...and we dry you out for a while,
until you test better later on.

372
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:55,291
At New Path?

373
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:57,291
-Undoubtedly.
-Undoubtedly.

374
00:26:57,467 --> 00:27:00,468
Now, what do you see in this drawing...

375
00:27:00,636 --> 00:27:04,171
...among these particular
black-and-white lines?

376
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:08,010
Plastic dog shit.

377
00:27:08,185 --> 00:27:10,557
The little kind you can buy
and put in someone's bed.

378
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:13,098
Can I go now?

379
00:27:13,983 --> 00:27:17,317
You know, Fred, if you keep
your sense of humor like you do...

380
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:19,858
...you just might make it after all.

381
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,736
Make it. Make what?

382
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:24,653
The team? The girl?

383
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:26,369
Make good? Make do?

384
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:29,111
Make out? Make sense?
Make money? Make time?

385
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,867
Define your terms.

386
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:33,035
<i>The Latin for make is facere...</i>

387
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:35,334
<i>...which always reminds me of fuckere...</i>

388
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:38,375
...which is Latin for to fuck. 

389
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:41,965
And I haven't been getting shit
in that department lately.

390
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:44,797
lf you guys are psychologist-types...

391
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:49,385
...and you've been monitoring my
endless debriefings with Hank, tell me:

392
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:51,887
What the hell is Donna's deal?

393
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:54,020
What do I do? I mean...

394
00:27:54,191 --> 00:27:58,355
...how do you make it with that kind of
sweet, unique, stubborn little chick?

395
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:00,903
You could buy her flowers.

396
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,865
Really?

397
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:06,532
This time of year, you can get
little blue flowers at any nursery.

398
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:08,661
Give them to her.

399
00:28:17,256 --> 00:28:18,963
Yeah.

400
00:28:20,926 --> 00:28:24,176
Hey, Fred, glad you could make it.

401
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:30,096
This is the informant who phoned in
about Bob Arctor, and I mentioned him.

402
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:31,846
-Yes.
-Anyway, he phoned in again...

403
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:36,102
...and we challenged him to step forth
and identify himself.

404
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:38,269
Do you know this man?

405
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:40,903
Sure do.

406
00:28:41,448 --> 00:28:44,153
You're James Barris, aren't you?

407
00:28:45,117 --> 00:28:48,118
So, Mr. Barris, what's your information?

408
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:53,117
I have evidence that Mr. Arctor is part of
a covert terrorist drug organization.

409
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:57,076
They are well-funded and they have
arsenals of weapons at their disposal.

410
00:28:57,256 --> 00:28:58,798
And what is this organization?

411
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:04,252
I believe it to be political in nature
and very much against this country.

412
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,303
An enemy of the U.S.

413
00:29:06,472 --> 00:29:11,634
Can you give us any specific names of
anyone else in this organization...

414
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:13,436
...persons Arctor meets with?

415
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:15,314
Yes. Miss Donna Hawthorne.

416
00:29:15,482 --> 00:29:19,315
On a variety of pretexts, he will
go over to her place of residence...

417
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:22,938
...and colludes with her regularly,
I've noticed.

418
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:24,574
Colludes.

419
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:26,951
-Colludes.
-What do you mean?

420
00:29:27,118 --> 00:29:30,286
Well, I've followed him in my own car
without his knowledge.

421
00:29:30,455 --> 00:29:32,615
-He goes there often.
-Yes, as often as--

422
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:35,116
-She is his girl.
-Right.

423
00:29:35,294 --> 00:29:38,082
-Mr. Arctor also seemingly--
-Hold up, hold up.

424
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:40,337
You think there's anything to this, Fred?

425
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:44,211
I think we should definitely
look at his evidence.

426
00:29:44,386 --> 00:29:46,344
All right. Bring in your evidence.

427
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:49,219
All of it. We want names most of all.

428
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:53,009
Now, have you seen
Mr. Arctor involved...

429
00:29:53,188 --> 00:29:56,354
...in any large quantities of drugs?

430
00:29:56,523 --> 00:29:58,896
To be certain.
And I have carefully taken samples--

431
00:29:59,528 --> 00:30:00,855
Again, without his knowledge.

432
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:04,195
--when the opportunity presented itself,
strictly for you to analyze.

433
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:06,404
-I can bring those in as well.
-Great.

434
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:10,369
Is there anything else
you wish to state at this time?

435
00:30:10,538 --> 00:30:15,414
There is. Mr. Arctor is an addict.
He is addicted to Substance D.

436
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:18,373
And I fear that his mind has become
deranged over time...

437
00:30:18,547 --> 00:30:24,217
...and he is now officially
to be considered dangerous.

438
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,594
-Dangerous.
-Yes. He is having episodes...

439
00:30:26,763 --> 00:30:29,718
...that would occur with
brain damage from Substance D.

440
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:33,723
I'm quite certain, also, that the optic
chiasm has deteriorated somewhat...

441
00:30:33,895 --> 00:30:36,221
...due to a weak ipsilateral component.

442
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:40,313
This sort of unsupported speculation,
as I've already warned you, Mr. Barris...

443
00:30:40,486 --> 00:30:42,728
...is completely worthless.

444
00:30:42,904 --> 00:30:47,401
Now, we'll be sending an officer
with you to gather your evidence.

445
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:49,568
-All right?
-May I--?

446
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:51,867
An officer out of uniform, of course.

447
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:55,160
No, see, I could be murdered.

448
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:59,663
As I've already said,
Mr. Arctor has this cache of weapons.

449
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:04,631
Mr. Barris, we appreciate this
and the extreme risk you are taking.

450
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:10,259
And if it works out, and your information
is valuable in obtaining a conviction...

451
00:31:10,432 --> 00:31:13,103
-...then naturally--
-But that is not the reason I'm here.

452
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:15,595
You see, this man is--
He just has a soul sickness.

453
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:20,351
His brain is damaged from the use of
this toxic and most terrible substance.

454
00:31:20,527 --> 00:31:25,438
Nonetheless, the reason I am here is
I feel that I may have certain qualities...

455
00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:29,067
...that would qualify me
to perhaps come over to your side.

456
00:31:29,243 --> 00:31:31,781
To surrender and come to
the side of law enforcement.

457
00:31:31,954 --> 00:31:35,655
-I would like an employment application.
-We don't care why you're here.

458
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:40,626
We only care whether your evidence and
material amount to anything.

459
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,003
The rest is your problem.

460
00:31:48,555 --> 00:31:52,719
Perhaps at the desk
I can get an employment... .

461
00:31:54,185 --> 00:31:55,348
You are about to witness...

462
00:31:55,479 --> 00:32:00,141
...for approximately 61 cents of
ordinary household materials...

463
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:03,153
...the perfect homemade silencer.

464
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:05,314
Barris, the neighbors are gonna hear.

465
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:07,862
No, they only call in murders
in this neighborhood.

466
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:11,817
Plus, Freckledeck, it's a silencer.
They're not gonna hear anything.

467
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,661
Well, I'm pretty fucking sure
they're illegal.

468
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:21,374
In this day and age, the type of society
we find ourselves living in...

469
00:32:21,547 --> 00:32:22,791
...every person of worth...

470
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:25,920
...needs to have a gun at all times,
to protect themselves.

471
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:27,505
And we're off.

472
00:32:42,277 --> 00:32:43,818
That sure is some silencer.

473
00:32:43,987 --> 00:32:48,863
Yes. What it did was augment
the sound, rather than dampen it.

474
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:51,903
But I almost have it.
I believe I have it in principle, anyway.

475
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:55,198
Oh, well, the good news is,
regardless of what you do next time...

476
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:59,157
...it'll be a silencer to us,
because we're now deaf!

477
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:15,057
<i>What happened?</i>

478
00:33:18,314 --> 00:33:20,390
<i>How'd I get here?</i>

479
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:31,284
Okay, it's your move now.

480
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,958
Anyone want some popcorn?

481
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:40,501
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

482
00:33:52,848 --> 00:33:54,473
Fuck!

483
00:34:01,232 --> 00:34:02,976
<i>The pain...</i>

484
00:34:03,527 --> 00:34:05,104
<i>...so unexpected and undeserved...</i>

485
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,445
<i>...had, for some reason,
cleared away the cobwebs.</i>

486
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,784
<i>I realized I didn't hate the cabinet door.</i>

487
00:34:12,952 --> 00:34:17,780
<i>I hated my life, my house, my family...</i>

488
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:20,246
-Are you okay, Daddy?
-What happened?

489
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:22,541
<i>...my backyard...</i>

490
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:25,869
<i>...my power mower.</i>

491
00:34:26,925 --> 00:34:29,132
<i>Nothing would ever change.</i>

492
00:34:29,302 --> 00:34:32,719
<i>Nothing new could ever be expected.</i>

493
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:37,304
<i>It had to end, and it did.</i>

494
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,434
<i>Now in the dark world where I dwell...</i>

495
00:34:42,608 --> 00:34:48,313
<i>...ugly things and surprising things
and sometimes little wondrous things...</i>

496
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:51,407
<i>...spill out at me constantly...</i>

497
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:54,949
<i>...and I can count on nothing.</i>

498
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,007
Medfly, got it.

499
00:35:13,014 --> 00:35:15,849
-That would be a Thelma Kornford.
-Oh, yeah, Miss Big-Tits.

500
00:35:16,016 --> 00:35:17,559
lf I had known it was harmless...

501
00:35:17,726 --> 00:35:20,764
-...I would have killed it myself.
-I would have killed it myself.

502
00:35:20,938 --> 00:35:23,014
Thanks for the mammaries.

503
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,021
She had such beautiful... .

504
00:35:28,697 --> 00:35:29,728
Daddy slowpoke.

505
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:33,068
-Oh, get around him, will you?
-You know what to do. Your move.

506
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:35,235
That's a big ten-four.

507
00:35:35,411 --> 00:35:36,954
Got nothing on us.

508
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:40,405
-There we go.
-Get a life!

509
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:41,994
Okay, Bob, no rush.

510
00:35:42,168 --> 00:35:43,710
-Not so fast.
-You are flying.

511
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:45,621
Decelerate.

512
00:35:46,715 --> 00:35:47,913
Steady.

513
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:49,585
-Decelerate.
-Slow down.

514
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:52,719
-Jesus.
-Son of a bitch.

515
00:35:54,264 --> 00:35:56,719
Come on. Decelerate!

516
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,891
Let us over.

517
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:09,902
It's an emergency.

518
00:36:10,072 --> 00:36:12,777
We're getting over. Emergency.

519
00:36:18,081 --> 00:36:20,239
-What the hell was that?
-Jesus fucking Christ.

520
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:22,456
What the hell in the hootenanny
was that?

521
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:26,081
The return spring
on the throttle cable, or... .

522
00:36:26,255 --> 00:36:27,536
Look, the gas.

523
00:36:27,923 --> 00:36:29,382
Was it cut or broken?

524
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,092
Let's give her a look.

525
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:41,556
Oh, my... .

526
00:36:47,068 --> 00:36:51,445
It's not the spring. It's the linkage
from the pedal to the carb. See?

527
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:56,490
It fell apart, so the gas pedal didn't push
back out when you took your foot off...

528
00:36:56,661 --> 00:37:00,077
-...but doesn't explain why--
-There is a safety override on the carb.

529
00:37:00,248 --> 00:37:02,822
-When the linkage parts, it's--
-Why'd it part?

530
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:05,916
Shouldn't this ring
hold the cable in place?

531
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:08,413
I mean, how could it
just come off like that?

532
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,547
Let's have a look. Let's probe a little.

533
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:15,297
All right. This screw has been turned
all the way out, the idle screw.

534
00:37:15,597 --> 00:37:19,132
So when the linkage parted, it went
the other way. Up instead of down.

535
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:22,514
Wait. Now, how could that happen?

536
00:37:22,813 --> 00:37:24,769
There is no way that that screw...

537
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,976
...could turn itself all the way out
like that accidentally.

538
00:37:28,152 --> 00:37:29,315
No way.

539
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:34,275
Motherfucker! They did it deliberately!

540
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:39,657
We almost died!
They almost fucking got us, man!

541
00:37:39,831 --> 00:37:41,788
To loosen the lock ring
and nut assembly...

542
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:43,914
...that holds the linkage rods together...

543
00:37:44,085 --> 00:37:46,706
...a special tool would be needed.
Several, in fact.

544
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,168
It'll take half an hour
to get this back together.

545
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,628
-I have the tools, though.
-Back at the house.

546
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:56,471
Correct. We can always go to
a repair center and borrow theirs...

547
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,012
...or get a tow truck out here.

548
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,777
Here.

549
00:38:11,987 --> 00:38:16,983
You know, maybe that's what's
fucking us up, fucking up our brains.

550
00:38:17,536 --> 00:38:21,153
-We're gonna wind up like Freck soon.
-No.

551
00:38:21,706 --> 00:38:23,864
Okay, these are for us.

552
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:27,916
And I'm going to suggest that you take
several, with the implicit acceptance...

553
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:31,041
...of the fact that Substance D
cannot screw up an accelerator...

554
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:35,047
-...or a carb-idle adjustment.
-Yeah, dude. Don't blame the drugs.

555
00:38:37,306 --> 00:38:38,847
-Come on.
-Well, so much for...

556
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,637
...our great road trip to San Diego, Bob.

557
00:38:41,811 --> 00:38:44,431
I told you we should have gone
to San Francisco.

558
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:46,313
What, like going to San Francisco...

559
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:49,019
...would not have caused
this problem with the engine?

560
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,980
Yeah, because when you're going north,
it screws this way.

561
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:54,146
When you're going south,
it screws that way.

562
00:38:54,322 --> 00:38:55,699
lf we were in Australia.

563
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:07,958
This proves you got somebody
out to get you real bad, Bob.

564
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:10,751
I just hope the house is still there
when we get back.

565
00:39:10,923 --> 00:39:12,333
Yeah, I didn't think of that.

566
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:15,295
-I wouldn't worry about it too much.
-You wouldn't?

567
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:18,920
Christ, they may have broken in
and ripped off all we got.

568
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:21,719
All Bob's got, anyhow.

569
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:24,300
What if they stomped the animals?

570
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:28,262
Don't worry about it.
I left a little surprise for them.

571
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:30,186
What?

572
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,820
Yes, anyone entering the house while we
were gone will receive a little surprise.

573
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:37,278
Little something I perfected
early this morning.

574
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:39,324
What kind of surprise?
It's my house, Jim.

575
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:43,077
You should ask me before
you start wiring up my house.

576
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,918
Why so uptight about
protecting your house from intruders?

577
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:47,413
Why would you care?

578
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,579
I'm just saying,
it's my house, that's all.

579
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:52,958
You can't start going around
booby-trapping my house.

580
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:56,467
<i>Okay, okay. I mean, jeez.
Or as the Germans say, leise...</i>

581
00:39:56,637 --> 00:39:59,306
...which translates to be cool. 
Just be cool.

582
00:39:59,974 --> 00:40:01,253
So, what did you do?

583
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:04,637
lf the front door is opened
while we are in absentia...

584
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:07,896
...thumbnail-sized, auxiliary,
motion-detector...

585
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:10,306
...digital-memory cameras
start recording.

586
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,525
You should have told me.

587
00:40:12,862 --> 00:40:16,112
What if they come in through
the back door or the bathroom window...

588
00:40:16,282 --> 00:40:17,989
...like that infamous Beatles' song?

589
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:20,994
To increase their chances of entering
via the front door...

590
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:23,949
...rather than in other less usual places...

591
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:26,579
...I, fortuitously,
left the front door unlocked.

592
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:30,664
-Suppose they don't know it's unlocked.
-That's why I left a note on the door.

593
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:34,039
-You're kidding me.
-No, no. No.

594
00:40:34,217 --> 00:40:37,336
Yes. But no. But yes.

595
00:40:37,512 --> 00:40:39,469
Are you bullshitting us or not?

596
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,880
I just simply never know with you.

597
00:40:42,057 --> 00:40:45,177
-Is he fucking with us, Bob?
-We'll see when we get back.

598
00:40:45,353 --> 00:40:49,481
lf there's a note on the door and it's
unlocked, we'll know he isn't lying.

599
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:51,476
They'd probably take the note down...

600
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,023
...after ripping off
and vandalizing the house...

601
00:40:54,195 --> 00:40:56,733
...and locking the door behind them,
so we don't know.

602
00:40:56,907 --> 00:40:59,907
We will never know.
It's still that gray area.

603
00:41:00,077 --> 00:41:02,650
Of course I'm kidding.
Only a psychotic would do that.

604
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:05,036
Leave the front door
unlocked with a note on it.

605
00:41:05,206 --> 00:41:06,748
What'd you write
on the note, Jim?

606
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:10,036
I wrote, Come on in,
the door's unlocked. 

607
00:41:10,503 --> 00:41:12,661
He did it. He really did it.

608
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,751
This is the only way we'll know
for sure who's been doing this.

609
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:18,382
And is that not what is
of primary importance?

610
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:22,552
Okay, I'm still gray here.
Now, did you do it or not?

611
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:24,681
Is it really that suspenseful?

612
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:26,844
-Did you?
-He did it.

613
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:28,728
Doesn't matter.
We'll be home shortly.

614
00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:30,978
-Did you?
-We'll be home presently.

615
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,856
Well, Barris, I can see you're right.

616
00:42:20,032 --> 00:42:24,612
This scrupulous covering-over of all
the signs they would've otherwise left...

617
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:27,954
...testifies to their thoroughness.

618
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,619
You're an idiot.

619
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:34,786
Oh, wait, wait. This-- What's that?

620
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:39,297
Come here, come here.
Look at this, look at this.

621
00:42:39,594 --> 00:42:43,094
A still-hot cigarette butt. It sure is.
Wait a second.

622
00:42:43,306 --> 00:42:45,632
They lit a joint
while they were here, Bob.

623
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:48,478
Fuck it. Barris is right,
there was somebody here.

624
00:42:48,646 --> 00:42:50,306
This roach is still hot, smell it.

625
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:54,146
Yes. And that roach may not have
been left here by accident.

626
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:56,110
This evidence may not be a slip-up.

627
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:00,480
-So, what now?
-Maybe they were here specifically...

628
00:43:00,657 --> 00:43:02,449
...to plant drugs in the house.

629
00:43:02,617 --> 00:43:04,990
Setting us up,
then phoning in a tip later.

630
00:43:05,163 --> 00:43:07,286
It could be in the phone,
the wall outlets.

631
00:43:07,456 --> 00:43:10,373
We have to go through this house
and get it absolutely clean...

632
00:43:10,543 --> 00:43:12,998
...before they phone us in,
unless they already have.

633
00:43:13,545 --> 00:43:14,791
We might only have minutes.

634
00:43:16,215 --> 00:43:18,836
You check the wall sockets.
I'll tear this phone apart.

635
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,003
Wait, hold on.
lf they see us scrambling...

636
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:22,721
-...before the raid--
-What raid?

637
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:25,177
lf we're frantically trying to
flush their drugs...

638
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:28,268
...we can't allege, though true,
we didn't know they were here.

639
00:43:28,436 --> 00:43:34,023
They're going to find us holding them,
or maybe that's part of the plan.

640
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:37,521
Shit, shit, shit.

641
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:41,860
We can't do anything.
We're fucked, man. Fuck.

642
00:43:43,202 --> 00:43:44,530
-Fucked, man!
-Barris...

643
00:43:44,702 --> 00:43:47,074
...what about the super-secret
surveillance cameras?

644
00:43:47,246 --> 00:43:50,248
-The what?
-The doodads, man.

645
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:53,952
Oh, yes, of course. Right, of course.
How could I have forgotten?

646
00:43:54,588 --> 00:43:57,161
This should be extremely informational
at this point.

647
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:02,085
I believe this will tell us a great deal.

648
00:44:07,018 --> 00:44:11,929
Although it probably wouldn't have
proven to be that important.

649
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:15,268
Let me guess: didn't record.

650
00:44:16,735 --> 00:44:21,646
Allow me to suggest that it's highly
likely that the tow truck was bugged...

651
00:44:21,824 --> 00:44:27,244
...thus affording them ample time and
opportunity to deploy an operative...

652
00:44:27,413 --> 00:44:30,864
...to diffuse and otherwise erase
the evidence obtained.

653
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:34,710
But we have no other recourse,
in view of their evasive tactics.

654
00:44:34,878 --> 00:44:38,829
There is, of course, one thing you could
do, Bob, although it would take time.

655
00:44:41,594 --> 00:44:44,085
Sell the house and move out?

656
00:44:45,681 --> 00:44:48,469
But hell, this is our home.

657
00:44:48,643 --> 00:44:49,887
You could make a profit.

658
00:44:50,061 --> 00:44:53,431
On the other hand, you might have to
take a loss on a quick sale.

659
00:44:54,106 --> 00:44:55,483
I know a good realtor.

660
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,938
What reason should I give for selling?
They always ask.

661
00:44:59,403 --> 00:45:01,777
Can't tell the truth.
You shouldn't tell the truth--

662
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,822
Why can't we tell the truth?

663
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,565
<i>We put an ad in the L.A. Times.</i>

664
00:45:06,744 --> 00:45:08,653
Modern, three-bedroom tract house...

665
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,403
...with two bathrooms
for easy and fast flushing...

666
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:15,581
...high-grade drugs stashed throughout
all rooms, included in sale price.

667
00:45:15,753 --> 00:45:18,291
It could actually increase the value.

668
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:21,300
But they might call and ask
what kind of drugs are stashed...

669
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,507
...and we don't know,
it could be anything.

670
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,086
Prospective buyers might inquire
as to the quantity.

671
00:45:26,264 --> 00:45:27,842
And we don't know at this point.

672
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:32,346
It could be ounces of weed or pounds of
heroin, or hits of E or killer caps of D.

673
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,643
Hey, you guys.

674
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,306
Fuck! Jesus.

675
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,643
What the fuck is wrong with you?

676
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:45,487
I came in, like the note said.

677
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,992
It didn't say when
you were gonna get back, so I just... .

678
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:54,157
I just sat around for a while
and ended up crashing.

679
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:57,123
-Love your sweater.
-Just-- Don't touch me.

680
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,163
Man, you guys were
making so much noise.

681
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:02,833
-Sorry.
-It woke me up.

682
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:07,425
Did you smoke a joint
before you crashed?

683
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,588
Yeah.

684
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,105
Otherwise, I can't ever sleep.

685
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:16,972
You know,
you guys should seriously think about...

686
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,985
...maybe locking the doors
when you leave.

687
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:24,063
Otherwise you could get ripped off
and it'd be your own fault.

688
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,364
This is all your fault.

689
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:30,532
Did I hear you say
you were gonna sell the house?

690
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:34,117
Or was that, you know, me dreaming?

691
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:36,581
Because what I heard sounded weird.

692
00:46:37,713 --> 00:46:38,958
Yeah, we're all dreaming.

693
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,253
Quiet. Steady. Steady.

694
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,838
Kidney. Kidney. Kidney.

695
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,092
So the information from the holo
scanners installed in Arctor's house...

696
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:52,969
...are transmitted back here,
to station 12-879.

697
00:46:53,896 --> 00:46:57,396
This'll be your new
home away from home, pal.

698
00:46:57,775 --> 00:47:00,396
It's pretty intuitive.

699
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:05,695
You'll just be watching and
scanning through recorded information.

700
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:10,244
You can go live, of course, but that
tends to be excruciatingly boring.

701
00:47:10,413 --> 00:47:13,532
And then, you see
where these holos are placed?

702
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:18,001
What would be great is if they ever
need servicing or changing out...

703
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,876
...you could do that yourself
while no one else is around.

704
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:23,920
But wouldn't you then see me
on the tapes doing that?

705
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:26,585
No. For that, you just edit yourself out.

706
00:47:26,762 --> 00:47:30,048
But be sure to include yourself
in the tapes from time to time...

707
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:32,762
...because if you systematically
edit yourself out...

708
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:35,936
...we can deduce who you are through
the process of elimination...

709
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:37,813
...whether we want to or not.

710
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:41,311
I'm not sure I exactly--

711
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:44,273
We take it for granted that you are
one of the individuals...

712
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:47,733
...that are in Arctor's circle
of roommates and friends...

713
00:47:47,909 --> 00:47:49,487
...that frequent the house.

714
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:53,659
I mean, undoubtedly, you're either
Jim Barris or Ernie Luckman...

715
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:55,827
...Charles Freck...

716
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,085
...even Arctor himself.

717
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:00,753
Hell, you could be Donna,
for all I know.

718
00:48:00,922 --> 00:48:04,257
As my superior,
I figure you'd know all this stuff.

719
00:48:04,427 --> 00:48:05,625
How the hell would I know?

720
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:08,259
I'm just a little guy behind a big desk.

721
00:48:08,431 --> 00:48:12,842
You'd have to go way up the food chain
to access that kind of info.

722
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:15,806
You know, instead of me
doing any maintenance...

723
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,648
...send someone to the house
once a month, in uniform...

724
00:48:18,815 --> 00:48:21,141
...and have him say, Good morning.

725
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:23,476
I'm here to service
the monitoring devices...

726
00:48:23,653 --> 00:48:26,987
...covertly installed on your premises. 

727
00:48:28,034 --> 00:48:31,699
Maybe that sucker Arctor
would even pick up the bill.

728
00:48:32,121 --> 00:48:36,664
Actually, I think Arctor would probably
kill the guy and then disappear.

729
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,664
lf it's proven that Arctor is,
in fact, hiding that much.

730
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:44,541
Believe me, Arctor is hiding a great deal.

731
00:48:44,717 --> 00:48:47,208
We've got more recent
information on him analyzed...

732
00:48:47,387 --> 00:48:51,681
...and there's no doubt about it,
he's a ringer.

733
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:55,135
A three-dollar bill. The guy is a phony.

734
00:48:55,478 --> 00:48:57,186
So keep on him until he drops...

735
00:48:57,356 --> 00:49:00,356
...until we have enough to arrest him
and make it stick.

736
00:49:00,775 --> 00:49:05,235
You think he's high up in the,
you know, Substance D network?

737
00:49:05,405 --> 00:49:08,322
What we think is of
no importance to your work.

738
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:13,034
You report your limited conclusions,
and we evaluate.

739
00:49:13,204 --> 00:49:15,695
-You got it?
-Okay, okay.

740
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:17,534
I got it.

741
00:49:20,211 --> 00:49:23,795
I'd say Arctor is doomed
if he's up to something.

742
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:29,545
And I have a hunch,
from what you're saying, that he is.

743
00:49:32,934 --> 00:49:36,432
The idling jets could be replaced with
smaller jets that would compensate.

744
00:49:36,603 --> 00:49:40,387
And with a tach, he could just watch
his rpms so it didn't over-rev.

745
00:49:40,565 --> 00:49:42,938
Usually just backing off
on the gas pedal...

746
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,862
...causes it to upshift
if the automatic linkage doesn't.

747
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,070
What are you grease monkeys up to?

748
00:49:48,574 --> 00:49:49,902
Bob's got a bent choke shaft.

749
00:49:50,577 --> 00:49:53,530
-How much does this Impala weigh?
-Weighs about 1000 pounds.

750
00:49:53,788 --> 00:49:57,074
Thousand pounds traveling at
80 miles per hour builds up a force of--

751
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,251
That's 1000 pounds with passengers
in it and a full tank of gas.

752
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,911
-For a fact? Okay.
-How many passengers?

753
00:50:03,088 --> 00:50:05,579
-Twelve.
-Six in the front, six in the back.

754
00:50:05,759 --> 00:50:08,961
No, that's 11 in the back
and the driver sitting alone in the front.

755
00:50:09,137 --> 00:50:11,923
Extra weight on the rear wheels
is to keep from fishtailing.

756
00:50:12,097 --> 00:50:14,007
We talking about
12 50-pound passengers?

757
00:50:14,184 --> 00:50:17,268
-Kids' soccer team.
-Now, is that metal or plastic cleats?

758
00:50:17,436 --> 00:50:20,603
-Metal cleats for safety.
-Okay, my computations are complete.

759
00:50:20,773 --> 00:50:24,641
You are just heckle tweak,
but you are bug-bite squared.

760
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,655
-What kind of bug?
-About-to-get-fucked-up-bitch beetle.

761
00:50:28,072 --> 00:50:30,065
-Hey, come on. Cool it, you guys.
-Tell me--

762
00:50:30,242 --> 00:50:34,286
Step back. Freck-and-frack,
Ernie's on the attack.

763
00:50:34,454 --> 00:50:36,079
-What is this?
-Come on.

764
00:50:36,248 --> 00:50:38,952
-I'm desperately afraid.
-I'm gonna knock your nads...

765
00:50:39,126 --> 00:50:42,043
...up into your nostrils
for talking to your betters that way.

766
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:44,501
All right.
I'm a technician, you're an interloper.

767
00:50:44,672 --> 00:50:47,958
You are constitutionally incapable
of not shutting the fuck up.

768
00:50:48,302 --> 00:50:49,630
-Bring it!
-Shut the fuck up!

769
00:50:49,804 --> 00:50:51,961
No, no, proctology boy,
I'm coming after you.

770
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:53,965
Shut it. Hey. Hey.

771
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:57,141
I have the perfect tool for this job.

772
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,016
-I was only kidding him.
-Fuck.

773
00:51:04,485 --> 00:51:05,943
Fuck!

774
00:51:06,612 --> 00:51:09,697
What if he goes in there
and he gets his gun and his silencer?

775
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:12,652
I'm leaving.
This place has become unsafe.

776
00:51:13,536 --> 00:51:17,284
No, hey, hey, Freck. No, come on.
You're a bro, man. Stick around.

777
00:51:21,168 --> 00:51:23,327
What's the hammer for, Barris?

778
00:51:23,505 --> 00:51:27,371
No, I just saw it inside and thought I,
you know, should bring it along with me.

779
00:51:30,637 --> 00:51:33,009
-Same with this.
-You ready?

780
00:51:33,181 --> 00:51:34,675
Yeah, what do you want?

781
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:36,307
-Come on, hammerhead.
-Shut up.

782
00:51:36,476 --> 00:51:37,971
-Make a move.
-Don't like it.

783
00:51:38,144 --> 00:51:41,762
Okay. lf you guys are gonna
kill each other, I'm splitting.

784
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,644
-It's getting very fucked up over here.
-Hey, Freck.

785
00:51:44,818 --> 00:51:48,318
The most dangerous kind of person is
the one who's afraid of his own shadow.

786
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,152
-What is that supposed to mean?
-I'll tell you.

787
00:51:51,324 --> 00:51:53,697
It means that if you take
too much of that stuff...

788
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:55,862
...you not only start seeing
bugs all over...

789
00:51:56,038 --> 00:51:58,873
...but you start talking like...and
no one can understand you.

790
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:01,329
What'd you say, Barris?
I didn't understand.

791
00:52:02,878 --> 00:52:04,371
See, you guys are fucked up.

792
00:52:04,547 --> 00:52:07,547
No, no, it is y-uck-uck-ou
that are fuck-ucked-ed up.

793
00:52:07,715 --> 00:52:09,875
Hey, go Freck yourself.

794
00:52:10,052 --> 00:52:12,210
Don't take the car, you'll kill yourself.

795
00:52:21,396 --> 00:52:26,273
So this guy's been going around claiming
to be a world-famous impostor, right?

796
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:31,023
Says he's posed, at one time or another,
as a surgeon at John Hopkins...

797
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:33,737
...as a theoretical,
submolecular, high-velocity...

798
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:37,278
...particle-research physicist
on a federal grant at Harvard...

799
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:41,619
...as a Finnish novelist
who won the Nobel Prize for literature...

800
00:52:41,793 --> 00:52:43,998
...as a deposed Argentinean president...

801
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:46,922
...who was married to a go-go dancer
from Chicago--

802
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,047
He got away with all that?

803
00:52:49,592 --> 00:52:52,213
-He never got caught?
-Okay, you broke my flow...

804
00:52:52,387 --> 00:52:55,092
...so now I guess I'll just have
to segue down to the near.

805
00:52:55,264 --> 00:52:57,802
That's just it.
You see, he didn't pose as any of those.

806
00:52:57,976 --> 00:53:01,891
He just posed as
a world-famous impostor. Yeah.

807
00:53:02,063 --> 00:53:03,771
<i>It came out later in the L.A. Times.</i>

808
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:07,641
They checked up, and he was pushing
a broom at Disneyland or something.

809
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,480
He saw that old DiCaprio movie.

810
00:53:09,655 --> 00:53:13,106
You know, the one where
he plays a world-famous impostor...

811
00:53:13,282 --> 00:53:15,240
...before Leonardo hit his Elvis stage.

812
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:16,608
And his first thought was:

813
00:53:16,786 --> 00:53:20,487
Hey, I could pose as all those
exotic guys and get away with it. 

814
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:23,121
But then, his next thought was,
Hell, why bother?

815
00:53:23,293 --> 00:53:27,753
I could just pose as an impostor,
and it'd be a lot easier. 

816
00:53:27,922 --> 00:53:31,291
They say that he made more money
than the actual impostor...

817
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:36,463
<i>...although I'm not sure
if they'd adjust for inflation.</i>

818
00:53:37,557 --> 00:53:39,965
<i>Well, you know,
we all see impostors now and then...</i>

819
00:53:40,143 --> 00:53:42,931
<i>...but not posing
as subatomic physicists.</i>

820
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,813
<i>Oh, as a narc, you mean.</i>

821
00:53:45,983 --> 00:53:47,643
<i>What's a narc look like?</i>

822
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:50,985
<i>That's like asking,
What's an impostor look like?</i>

823
00:53:51,322 --> 00:53:53,195
<i>I talked to this dealer
who 'd been busted.</i>

824
00:53:53,365 --> 00:53:56,117
<i>I asked him what the narc
who busted him looked like.</i>

825
00:53:56,286 --> 00:53:58,527
<i>What did he say, he looked just like us?</i>

826
00:53:59,664 --> 00:54:01,407
<i>More so.</i>

827
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:03,989
<i>So I guess the moral of that is...</i>

828
00:54:05,045 --> 00:54:07,998
<i>...stay away from guys
looking the same as us.</i>

829
00:54:11,467 --> 00:54:13,342
<i>Well, there are female narcs.</i>

830
00:54:13,512 --> 00:54:15,550
<i>Oh, hey, I'd like to meet one of those.</i>

831
00:54:15,972 --> 00:54:19,637
<i>No, I don 't mean a female. I mean
just the narc, knowingly, like, positive.</i>

832
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:23,677
<i>Sure. So you could positively know.
And you will.</i>

833
00:54:23,855 --> 00:54:27,188
<i>When he slaps the cuffs on, you'll know
for sure, when that day comes.</i>

834
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:29,186
<i>How could a guy do that?</i>

835
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,855
<i>Pose as a narc?</i>

836
00:54:31,447 --> 00:54:32,775
<i>-What?
-What?</i>

837
00:54:33,614 --> 00:54:35,442
<i>Pose as a narc?</i>

838
00:54:35,617 --> 00:54:38,617
<i>-No, you said it. So yeah.
-Pose as a narc.</i>

839
00:54:39,538 --> 00:54:43,831
<i>Oh, sh-- Shit, I'm spaced.</i>

840
00:54:44,001 --> 00:54:45,827
<i>Pose as a narc, wow.</i>

841
00:54:46,628 --> 00:54:49,036
<i>Pose as a narc.</i>

842
00:54:51,132 --> 00:54:53,375
<i>My brains are scrambled today.</i>

843
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,135
Christ, Barris, what the fuck?

844
00:56:34,697 --> 00:56:36,489
<i>Yes, hi. How are you?</i>

845
00:56:36,657 --> 00:56:39,195
<i>I have something
somewhat emergent to report.</i>

846
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:43,579
<i>I don 't know if I should be summoning
the inhalator squad...</i>

847
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:45,907
<i>...or the resuscitation squad.</i>

848
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:47,996
<i>Yes, ma 'am?</i>

849
00:56:48,168 --> 00:56:50,920
<i>I don 't know. I don 't want to say
it's not cardiac arrest...</i>

850
00:56:51,088 --> 00:56:55,632
<i>...but it's either that or an involuntary
asphyxiation of a bolus within the--</i>

851
00:56:56,177 --> 00:56:59,012
<i>The address, yes.
The address is simple...</i>

852
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:01,719
<i>...although I've never sent myself
a piece of mail here.</i>

853
00:57:01,891 --> 00:57:05,842
<i>Seven-- Seven-- Seven-zero-niner.
Street? Is the street relevant?</i>

854
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:08,476
<i>-Come on.
-Tell you this much, it is a cul-de-sac.</i>

855
00:57:10,067 --> 00:57:12,023
<i>Does that technically qualify as a street?</i>

856
00:57:12,193 --> 00:57:15,396
<i>I'm pleased to report we won 't
be needing your assistance after all.</i>

857
00:57:15,572 --> 00:57:17,648
<i>Thank you. Have a nice day.</i>

858
00:57:18,032 --> 00:57:20,951
<i>There you go. Took care of itself.</i>

859
00:57:22,663 --> 00:57:23,943
<i>-Okay.
-Oh, Jesus.</i>

860
00:57:24,123 --> 00:57:26,411
<i>You all right? There you go.</i>

861
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:28,208
<i>I must've passed out.</i>

862
00:57:28,376 --> 00:57:31,876
<i>-Yeah.
-Well, you-- I was dreaming.</i>

863
00:57:32,547 --> 00:57:34,706
<i>-Must have almost died.
-Yeah.</i>

864
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:36,378
<i>Shit.</i>

865
00:57:37,762 --> 00:57:41,889
<i>And what were you doing while
I was being escorted by dead relatives...</i>

866
00:57:42,057 --> 00:57:44,181
<i>... to the bright light? Jacking off?</i>

867
00:57:44,351 --> 00:57:46,309
<i>No, no, no. You saw me.
I was on the phone.</i>

868
00:57:46,478 --> 00:57:47,938
<i>I summoned the paramedics.</i>

869
00:57:48,106 --> 00:57:51,639
<i>-I sprung into action without delay.
-Bullshit. You were cleaning your pipe.</i>

870
00:57:51,818 --> 00:57:53,856
<i>I was wrapping my pipe.
You were unconscious.</i>

871
00:57:54,027 --> 00:57:57,563
<i>You the only person in the universe who
never heard of the Heimlich maneuver?</i>

872
00:57:57,865 --> 00:58:00,190
<i>All right,
I'm gonna give you a little feedback...</i>

873
00:58:00,367 --> 00:58:04,318
<i>...since you seem to be proceeding
through life like a cat without whiskers...</i>

874
00:58:04,496 --> 00:58:07,119
<i>...perpetually caught
behind the refrigerator.</i>

875
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:10,159
<i>Your life and watching you live it...</i>

876
00:58:10,336 --> 00:58:13,088
<i>...is like a gag reel
of ineffective bodily functions.</i>

877
00:58:13,255 --> 00:58:17,300
<i>I swear to God that a toddler
has a better understanding...</i>

878
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:19,925
<i>...of the intricacies of
chew, swallow, digest...</i>

879
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:22,552
<i>...don 't kill yourself on your TV dinner.</i>

880
00:58:22,724 --> 00:58:25,927
<i>And yet, you've managed to
turn this near-death fuck-up of yours...</i>

881
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:27,811
<i>...into a moral referendum on me.</i>

882
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:30,518
<i>-You are a monster!
-Oh, fuck.</i>

883
00:58:30,648 --> 00:58:33,519
<i>-You are a billy goat.
-A sick, depraved un--</i>

884
00:58:38,824 --> 00:58:41,777
<i>Charles Freck, becoming progressively
more and more depressed...</i>

885
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:45,784
<i>...by what was happening around him,
decided finally to off himself.</i>

886
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:48,447
<i>There was no problem
in the circles where he hung out...</i>

887
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:50,119
<i>...in putting an end to yourself.</i>

888
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:52,333
<i>You just bought a large quantity
of downers...</i>

889
00:58:52,505 --> 00:58:54,414
<i>...and took them with cheap wine.</i>

890
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:56,797
<i>The planning part had to do
with the artifacts...</i>

891
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:59,969
<i>...he wanted found on him
by later archeologists.</i>

892
00:59:00,471 --> 00:59:02,297
<i>He had spent several days deciding...</i>

893
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:06,173
<i>...much longer than he had spent
deciding to kill himself.</i>

894
00:59:06,351 --> 00:59:08,641
<i>He would be found lying on his back
on his bed...</i>

895
00:59:08,813 --> 00:59:11,268
<i>... with a copy of Ayn Rand's
The Fountainhead...</i>

896
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,313
<i>...and an unfinished letter to Exxon...</i>

897
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,688
<i>...protesting the cancellation
of his gas credit card.</i>

898
00:59:16,862 --> 00:59:20,313
<i>That way, he would indict the system
and achieve something by his death...</i>

899
00:59:20,492 --> 00:59:23,492
<i>...over and above
what the death itself achieved.</i>

900
00:59:23,952 --> 00:59:26,907
<i>At the last moment, he changed his mind
on a decisive issue...</i>

901
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:29,998
<i>...and decided to drink the pills
with a connoisseur wine...</i>

902
00:59:30,168 --> 00:59:32,208
<i>...instead of Ripple or Thunderbird.</i>

903
00:59:32,378 --> 00:59:35,463
<i>So he set off on one last drive,
over to Tiny's Liquors...</i>

904
00:59:35,632 --> 00:59:37,340
<i>... which specialized in fine wines...</i>

905
00:59:37,509 --> 00:59:40,463
<i>...and bought a bottle
of 2001 Azalea Springs Merlot...</i>

906
00:59:40,637 --> 00:59:42,510
<i>... which set him back almost $ 7 0.</i>

907
00:59:45,434 --> 00:59:49,681
<i>Back home again, he uncorked the wine,
let it breathe, drank a few glasses of it...</i>

908
00:59:49,855 --> 00:59:52,690
<i>...and tried to think
of something meaningful, but could not.</i>

909
00:59:52,858 --> 00:59:56,690
<i>And then, with a glass of merlot,
gulped down all the pills at once.</i>

910
00:59:58,947 --> 01:00:01,188
<i>However, he had been burned.</i>

911
01:00:01,367 --> 01:00:06,740
<i>Instead of quietly suffocating,
Charles Freck began to hallucinate.</i>

912
01:00:06,914 --> 01:00:09,701
<i>The next thing he knew,
a creature from between dimensions...</i>

913
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:13,789
<i>... was standing beside his bed,
looking down at him disapprovingly.</i>

914
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,922
You're gonna read me my sins?

915
01:00:20,802 --> 01:00:22,711
It's gonna take 100,000 hours?

916
01:00:23,054 --> 01:00:28,179
Your sins will be read to you ceaselessly,
in shifts, throughout eternity.

917
01:00:28,936 --> 01:00:31,391
The list will never end.

918
01:00:33,565 --> 01:00:35,606
The Sins of Freck. 

919
01:00:35,985 --> 01:00:39,436
<i>Charles Freck wished he could take back
the last half-hour of his life.</i>

920
01:00:39,614 --> 01:00:42,947
Age 6, in the first grade:
theft of fingernail clippers.

3:08 p.m. Theft.

922
01:00:45,077 --> 01:00:48,280
You did knowingly and with malice
punch your baby sister, Evelyn.

923
01:00:48,456 --> 01:00:49,570
Kicking the dog.

924
01:00:49,748 --> 01:00:52,454
December: theft of Christmas presents.

One million lies. Destruction of... . 

926

<i>One thousand years later,
they had reached the sixth grade...</i>

masturbation.</i>

<i>Charles Freck thought,
At least I got a good wine. </i>

931
01:01:10,478 --> 01:01:12,518
Where did Substance D come from?

932
01:01:12,648 --> 01:01:14,059
Why can't we stop it?

933
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:17,268
The bigger this war gets,
the more freedoms we lose...

934
01:01:17,443 --> 01:01:20,148
...the more Substance D
is on our streets.

935
01:01:20,322 --> 01:01:21,947
Can't you figure this out?

936
01:01:22,115 --> 01:01:24,653
Look around you.
Look how far we've come.

937
01:01:24,827 --> 01:01:27,282
Humanity wasn't meant to live like this.

938
01:01:27,454 --> 01:01:31,452
Our every waking moment
tracked and traced and scanned.

939
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:33,664
It's time to stop
submitting to this tyranny.

940
01:01:33,835 --> 01:01:36,706
It's time to realize
that we're being enslaved.

941
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,632
It's our tax dollars at work.
Protect us from ourselves.

942
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,592
Hey, guys, I used to be one of you.

943
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,967
Stop selling out your own species.

944
01:01:53,981 --> 01:01:56,472
Hey. Get in.

945
01:01:58,485 --> 01:02:00,146
You scared me.

946
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,527
Got something for you.

947
01:02:04,242 --> 01:02:07,777
I'm seeing some crazy shit tonight.

948
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:09,824
What do you mean?

949
01:02:10,248 --> 01:02:12,157
That fucking Barris.

950
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:14,242
You know how he works?

951
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:16,079
He doesn't kill anybody...

952
01:02:16,253 --> 01:02:20,003
...but he hangs around until
the situation arises where they die.

953
01:02:20,759 --> 01:02:24,376
And then he just sits there.

954
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:29,679
And he sort of sets them up
in the first place while he stays out of it.

955
01:02:29,851 --> 01:02:33,385
But I'm not sure how.

956
01:02:33,563 --> 01:02:37,264
Hey, do you have that money
for the stuff? I need it tonight.

957
01:02:37,443 --> 01:02:40,728
-Yeah. I have it.
-Okay.

958
01:02:42,197 --> 01:02:44,356
You know, I don't like Barris.

959
01:02:44,532 --> 01:02:46,193
And I don't trust him.

960
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:48,076
Guy's fucking crazy.

961
01:02:48,244 --> 01:02:50,570
And when you're around him,
you start acting crazy.

962
01:02:50,748 --> 01:02:53,369
And then when you're not around him,
you're fine.

963
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:56,496
You're acting crazy now.

964
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:59,672
-I am?
-Yes.

965
01:03:02,385 --> 01:03:06,298
Hey, will you take me to a concert
next weekend at Anaheim Stadium?

966
01:03:06,472 --> 01:03:07,635
Sure.

967
01:03:07,806 --> 01:03:09,715
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

968
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:13,387
Yeah. Which night?

969
01:03:13,563 --> 01:03:15,934
It's Sunday afternoon.

970
01:03:18,525 --> 01:03:20,565
Whatever you want.

971
01:03:22,237 --> 01:03:25,405
Well, I'll just drive over to my place.

972
01:03:25,574 --> 01:03:28,065
You have the money,
you'll give it to me.

973
01:03:28,244 --> 01:03:30,735
We'll kick back, drop some Death...

974
01:03:30,914 --> 01:03:33,487
...maybe get some tequila.

975
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:37,085
All right.

976
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:42,295
All right.

977
01:03:45,429 --> 01:03:48,097
Hey, Donna, do you like cats?

978
01:03:49,516 --> 01:03:51,972
Drippy little things.

979
01:03:52,143 --> 01:03:56,438
Moving along
about a foot above the ground.

980
01:03:56,606 --> 01:03:58,266
Above?

981
01:03:59,693 --> 01:04:01,934
You mean, on the ground?

982
01:04:02,112 --> 01:04:04,650
Just dripping...

983
01:04:04,822 --> 01:04:06,233
...behind furniture.

984
01:04:07,201 --> 01:04:12,443
Little spring flowers with blue in them
that come up first.

985
01:04:13,164 --> 01:04:14,659
Yeah.

986
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:16,992
-Before the--
-Before someone stomps on them...

987
01:04:17,168 --> 01:04:18,449
...and they're all gone.

988
01:04:20,922 --> 01:04:22,630
It's like you know me.

989
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,585
You can read me.

990
01:04:29,264 --> 01:04:31,934
Can I put my arms around you?

991
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:38,306
-I wanna hug you, okay?
-No.

992
01:04:38,483 --> 01:04:42,101
-What?
-Look, I do a lot of coke, okay?

993
01:04:42,277 --> 01:04:45,065
I just have to be really careful
because I do a lot of coke.

994
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:47,777
So just leave my body alone, okay?

995
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:50,327
Okay.

996
01:04:51,996 --> 01:04:53,324
Sure.

997
01:04:53,498 --> 01:04:55,076
Yeah.

998
01:04:57,501 --> 01:05:01,036
You know, fuck it.

999
01:05:01,757 --> 01:05:03,465
Hey, I-- I'm sorry.

1000
01:05:03,632 --> 01:05:05,875
I just don't like it
when people grope my body...

1001
01:05:06,052 --> 01:05:09,338
...and I have to watch out for that
because I snort so much coke.

1002
01:05:09,847 --> 01:05:11,840
That's fucking lame. I gotta go.

1003
01:05:12,016 --> 01:05:13,344
Your car's not fixed.

1004
01:05:14,769 --> 01:05:17,059
I drove you here, I'll drive you back.

1005
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,478
Bob.

1006
01:05:22,987 --> 01:05:24,777
Bob.

1007
01:05:25,864 --> 01:05:28,568
Bob, wait.

1008
01:05:28,742 --> 01:05:30,320
Please.

1009
01:05:30,494 --> 01:05:32,072
Please wait.

1010
01:05:32,246 --> 01:05:35,829
I didn't mean-- I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

1011
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,538
I'm just-- I'm so out of it right now.

1012
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:42,329
I-- Sometimes after I've worked
really hard all day, I--

1013
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:43,882
Please, come back.

1014
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:46,338
Come on. With the tequila.

1015
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,003
How much do you do?

1016
01:05:52,641 --> 01:05:56,057
Not that much.
And I don't shoot up.

1017
01:05:56,228 --> 01:05:58,387
I never have and I never will. I--

1018
01:05:58,565 --> 01:06:02,478
Once you start shooting,
you got like six months, maybe.

1019
01:06:02,652 --> 01:06:04,146
And even tap water.

1020
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,063
You get a habit.

1021
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:08,112
You have a habit.

1022
01:06:09,617 --> 01:06:11,277
We all do.

1023
01:06:11,452 --> 01:06:14,822
I mean, so what? What's the difference?

1024
01:06:14,998 --> 01:06:17,121
I'm happy.

1025
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:20,163
-Aren't you happy?
-Listen to me.

1026
01:06:21,295 --> 01:06:23,253
I think it's starting to get bad.

1027
01:06:30,137 --> 01:06:33,092
You know what
I wanna do someday, Bob?

1028
01:06:33,432 --> 01:06:37,099
I wanna move north, live on a farm...

1029
01:06:37,271 --> 01:06:41,599
...near the mountains, in a cabin.

1030
01:06:41,775 --> 01:06:43,434
Can I go with you?

1031
01:06:44,987 --> 01:06:47,025
I hope so.

1032
01:06:48,949 --> 01:06:50,858
I hope so.

1033
01:07:08,552 --> 01:07:11,340
All right. You weren't kidding.

1034
01:07:31,492 --> 01:07:33,780
Do you have a toothbrush?

1035
01:07:33,954 --> 01:07:35,496
What?

1036
01:07:35,664 --> 01:07:37,324
Well, screw it. Screw it.

1037
01:07:37,498 --> 01:07:39,159
Teeth are teeth.

1038
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:42,250
I'll-- I'll brush them.

1039
01:07:46,967 --> 01:07:49,090
Know where the bathroom is?

1040
01:07:50,387 --> 01:07:52,130
What bathroom?

1041
01:07:54,474 --> 01:07:56,052
In the house.

1042
01:07:58,853 --> 01:08:01,096
Who are those guys out there?

1043
01:08:01,273 --> 01:08:03,847
Rolling joints and rattling on and on?

1044
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,146
They live here with you?

1045
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,146
Two of them do.

1046
01:08:09,447 --> 01:08:11,570
So you're gay?

1047
01:08:13,369 --> 01:08:15,907
Try not to be.
That's why I called you tonight.

1048
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:19,163
So you're putting up
a pretty good battle against it.

1049
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:21,868
You better believe it.

1050
01:08:23,587 --> 01:08:24,962
Guess I'm about to find out.

1051
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:30,207
lf you're a latent gay, then
you'll want me to take the initiative.

1052
01:08:30,386 --> 01:08:32,627
You want me to undress you?

1053
01:08:32,805 --> 01:08:34,382
Sure.

1054
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:29,939
Oh, Jesus, fuck.

1055
01:09:47,422 --> 01:09:48,621
Hello?

1056
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:52,927
<i>Fred, we've processed
some more recent material on you.</i>

1057
01:09:53,095 --> 01:09:55,253
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

1058
01:09:55,681 --> 01:09:57,425
Okay.

1059
01:09:58,141 --> 01:09:59,766
<i>Any problems?</i>

1060
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:02,059
Well, I had a fight with my girl.

1061
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:03,475
<i>Any confusion?</i>

1062
01:10:03,648 --> 01:10:08,854
<i>Are you experiencing any difficulty
identifying persons or objects?</i>

1063
01:10:09,028 --> 01:10:11,317
<i>Any language disorientation?</i>

1064
01:10:11,488 --> 01:10:12,984
No.

1065
01:10:13,365 --> 01:10:15,524
<i>Can you come back over to room 203?</i>

1066
01:10:15,702 --> 01:10:19,118
What did you find to be a problem?

1067
01:10:19,288 --> 01:10:21,282
<i>We'll take that up when you get here.</i>

1068
01:11:26,858 --> 01:11:28,399
Connie.

1069
01:11:30,235 --> 01:11:32,028
Donna.

1070
01:11:59,932 --> 01:12:02,886
All right, Fred. Very good.

1071
01:12:03,061 --> 01:12:06,430
And this next test,
with your eyes covered...

1072
01:12:06,606 --> 01:12:10,306
...reach out and feel an object
with each hand.

1073
01:12:10,735 --> 01:12:13,606
You are to tell us if the object
presented to your left hand...

1074
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:16,485
...is identical to the object
presented to your right.

1075
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:43,595
One more thing, Fred.

1076
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:45,478
We need an updated blood test.

1077
01:12:45,646 --> 01:12:48,931
So go down the hall to the
pathology lab, and they'll fix you up.

1078
01:12:49,109 --> 01:12:52,690
And by the time you get back, we should
almost be through with our evaluation.

1079
01:12:52,862 --> 01:12:54,521
I'll be upstairs with Hank.

1080
01:12:54,698 --> 01:12:56,820
You certainly seem
much more depressed today...

1081
01:12:56,992 --> 01:12:59,030
...than you did when we first saw you.

1082
01:13:02,456 --> 01:13:03,949
Pardon?

1083
01:13:04,123 --> 01:13:07,707
Last week, when we first saw you,
you were kidding and laughing.

1084
01:13:07,877 --> 01:13:10,001
Did you ever get her the flowers?

1085
01:13:18,055 --> 01:13:20,627
<i>Crazy job they gave me.</i>

1086
01:13:20,807 --> 01:13:23,809
<i>But if I wasn't doing it,
someone else would be.</i>

1087
01:13:23,976 --> 01:13:25,970
<i>And they might get it wrong.</i>

1088
01:13:26,145 --> 01:13:30,559
<i>They might set Arctor up,
plant drugs on him and collect a reward.</i>

1089
01:13:30,734 --> 01:13:34,483
<i>Better it be me,
despite the disadvantages.</i>

1090
01:13:34,654 --> 01:13:39,483
<i>Just protecting everyone from Barris
is justification in itself.</i>

1091
01:13:41,828 --> 01:13:43,703
<i>What the hell am I talking about?</i>

1092
01:13:43,872 --> 01:13:45,367
<i>I must be nuts.</i>

1093
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:48,827
<i>I know Bob Arctor. He's a good person.</i>

1094
01:13:50,212 --> 01:13:54,506
<i>He's up to nothing.
At least, nothing too bad.</i>

1095
01:13:56,551 --> 01:14:00,252
<i>In fact, he works for the Orange County
Sheriff's Office covertly...</i>

1096
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:03,882
<i>... which is probably why
Barris is after him.</i>

1097
01:14:05,228 --> 01:14:06,507
<i>But that wouldn't explain...</i>

1098
01:14:06,688 --> 01:14:09,557
<i>... why the Orange County
Sheriff's Office is after him.</i>

1099
01:14:12,234 --> 01:14:16,185
<i>Something big is definitely
going down in this house.</i>

1100
01:14:16,363 --> 01:14:20,408
<i>This rundown, rubble-filled house...</i>

1101
01:14:20,577 --> 01:14:22,451
<i>... with its weed-patch yard...</i>

1102
01:14:22,621 --> 01:14:25,242
<i>...and cat box that never gets emptied.</i>

1103
01:14:25,414 --> 01:14:28,368
<i>What a waste of a truly good house.</i>

1104
01:14:28,542 --> 01:14:31,247
<i>So much could be done with it.</i>

1105
01:14:31,587 --> 01:14:34,542
<i>A family and children could live here.</i>

1106
01:14:34,882 --> 01:14:36,876
<i>It was designed for that.</i>

1107
01:14:37,051 --> 01:14:38,594
<i>Such a waste.</i>

1108
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:42,755
<i>They ought to confiscate it
and put it to better use.</i>

1109
01:14:55,613 --> 01:14:58,779
<i>I'm supposed to act like they aren't here.</i>

1110
01:14:58,948 --> 01:15:02,033
<i>Assuming there's a they at all.</i>

1111
01:15:02,536 --> 01:15:05,537
<i>It may just be my imagination.</i>

1112
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:08,501
<i>Whatever it is that's watching...</i>

1113
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:10,791
<i>...it's not human...</i>

1114
01:15:10,962 --> 01:15:13,631
<i>...unlike little dark-eyed Donna.</i>

1115
01:15:13,965 --> 01:15:16,289
<i>It doesn't ever blink.</i>

1116
01:15:17,969 --> 01:15:20,673
<i>What does a scanner see?</i>

1117
01:15:20,846 --> 01:15:22,886
<i>Into the head?</i>

1118
01:15:23,307 --> 01:15:25,632
<i>Down into the heart?</i>

1119
01:15:26,101 --> 01:15:29,554
<i>Does it see into me, into us?</i>

1120
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:31,889
<i>Clearly or darkly?</i>

1121
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,979
<i>I hope it sees clearly, because
I can 't any longer see into myself.</i>

1122
01:15:38,405 --> 01:15:40,481
<i>I see only murk.</i>

1123
01:15:41,326 --> 01:15:44,824
<i>I hope for everyone's sake
the scanners do better.</i>

1124
01:15:45,287 --> 01:15:49,238
<i>Because if the scanner sees only darkly,
the way I do...</i>

1125
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:53,581
<i>... then I'm cursed and cursed again.</i>

1126
01:15:53,755 --> 01:15:56,672
<i>And we'll only wind up dead this way...</i>

1127
01:15:56,841 --> 01:16:02,880
<i>...knowing very little and getting
that little fragment wrong too.</i>

1128
01:16:08,186 --> 01:16:10,179
You show what we regard...

1129
01:16:10,355 --> 01:16:14,733
...more as competition phenomenon
than impairment.

1130
01:16:15,235 --> 01:16:16,350
Yeah?

1131
01:16:16,862 --> 01:16:20,480
Competition between the left and
the right hemispheres of your brain.

1132
01:16:20,658 --> 01:16:23,574
It's like you have two signals
that interfere with each other...

1133
01:16:23,743 --> 01:16:26,234
...by carrying conflicting information.

1134
01:16:26,413 --> 01:16:29,118
It's as if you have two fuel gauges
on your car.

1135
01:16:29,292 --> 01:16:31,248
They're studying
the same amount of fuel...

1136
01:16:31,418 --> 01:16:34,703
...but one says your tank is full,
the other registers empty.

1137
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:36,161
They can't both be right.

1138
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:39,958
And you as the driver have only
an indirect relationship to the fuel tank...

1139
01:16:40,136 --> 01:16:41,511
...via the gauges.

1140
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,554
So, what does all this mean?

1141
01:16:44,932 --> 01:16:47,257
Well, I'm sure you know already.

1142
01:16:47,435 --> 01:16:51,385
You've been experiencing it
without knowing why or what it is.

1143
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:55,234
Two hemispheres of my brain...

1144
01:16:55,859 --> 01:16:57,235
...are competing?

1145
01:16:57,612 --> 01:16:59,237
-Yes.
-Yes.

1146
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:04,319
But why?

1147
01:17:04,493 --> 01:17:05,953
Substance D.

1148
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:10,118
It often causes that, functionally,
and this is what the tests confirm.

1149
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:13,376
Damage has taken place to the
normally dominant left hemisphere...

1150
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:16,082
...and the right hemisphere
is attempting to compensate.

1151
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:17,667
Crosscutting, we call it...

1152
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:19,963
...related to split-brain phenomenon.

1153
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:24,262
We could perform
a right hemispherectomy...

1154
01:17:24,597 --> 01:17:25,926
...but I'd--

1155
01:17:26,265 --> 01:17:28,639
Will this ever go away?

1156
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,886
Probably. It's a functional impairment.

1157
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:35,230
It may be organic damage.

1158
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,943
It may be permanent.

1159
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:41,238
Time will tell, and only after you've
been off Substance D for a long while.

1160
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:47,621
I'll never take Substance D again
for the rest of my life.

1161
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:50,328
How much are you taking now?

1162
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,744
Not much.

1163
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:55,456
More, recently, because of job stress.

1164
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:07,137
<i>Death is swallowed up in victory.</i>

1165
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:10,641
<i>Behold, I tell you the sacred secret now:</i>

1166
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,979
<i>You shall not all sleep in death.</i>

1167
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:21,274
<i>We'll do the other half
of Southern California tomorrow night.</i>

1168
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,864
<i>The Air Force arsenal at Vandenberg
will be hit for automatic weapons--</i>

1169
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:28,036
<i>What about that anthrax
Anwar ripped off for us?</i>

1170
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:31,823
<i>When do we--? Aren't we supposed to
carry the stuff to the watershed area--?</i>

1171
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,376
<i>We need the weapons first.</i>

1172
01:18:33,627 --> 01:18:36,034
<i>Drugs in the water supply is step B.</i>

1173
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,751
<i>Okay, but I gotta go. I got a customer.</i>

1174
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:41,497
I can also identify
the aforementioned terrorist cell.

1175
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:44,381
It's indicated throughout the course
of my observations.

1176
01:18:44,555 --> 01:18:48,302
Do you have any more material of this
sort, or is this tape substantially it?

1177
01:18:48,475 --> 01:18:50,135
No, I have a veritable cornucopia...

1178
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:53,975
...and much of it is directly referencing
the organization and its directives.

1179
01:18:54,148 --> 01:18:56,817
Who are these people?
What organization?

1180
01:18:57,067 --> 01:18:59,984
It is primarily Arctor and Hawthorne.

1181
01:19:00,154 --> 01:19:03,439
I have coded notes here, which may be
of some interest to you.

1182
01:19:03,615 --> 01:19:08,360
I-- My own cryptology
is very difficult to--

1183
01:19:08,537 --> 01:19:11,408
As of now I'm impounding all of this.

1184
01:19:11,582 --> 01:19:15,082
It is our property temporarily,
and we will sort through it ourselves.

1185
01:19:15,252 --> 01:19:19,500
You will be on hand
to explain anything to us...

1186
01:19:19,673 --> 01:19:23,921
...if and when we get to the point where
we feel we need anything explained.

1187
01:19:24,095 --> 01:19:29,515
Mr. Barris, you will not be released
pending our study of this material.

1188
01:19:29,684 --> 01:19:33,515
You will be charged, as a formality,
to keep you available...

1189
01:19:33,688 --> 01:19:37,188
...with knowingly giving the authorities
false information.

1190
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:41,521
This, of course, is just a pretext
for your own safety.

1191
01:19:42,905 --> 01:19:44,697
I always wanted to go
to the Galapagos--

1192
01:19:44,865 --> 01:19:47,570
-Is that satisfactory, Mr. Barris?
-Not entirely.

1193
01:19:47,743 --> 01:19:49,570
Though I wonder,
when I'm locked down...

1194
01:19:49,746 --> 01:19:53,411
...may I be provided with some lotion,
and perhaps some...?

1195
01:20:00,256 --> 01:20:05,417
So, what do you think
of Barris' evidence?

1196
01:20:07,389 --> 01:20:11,172
Seems like what he played--
The little we heard anyway.

1197
01:20:11,351 --> 01:20:13,759
--sounded pretty genuine to me.

1198
01:20:13,938 --> 01:20:17,685
It's fake. Worthless.

1199
01:20:17,858 --> 01:20:19,518
Made on a home computer.

1200
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:21,984
Maybe you're right.

1201
01:20:23,863 --> 01:20:26,615
Is that my medical report
you have there?

1202
01:20:26,783 --> 01:20:28,243
Yep.

1203
01:20:29,244 --> 01:20:30,619
What does it say?

1204
01:20:32,122 --> 01:20:34,448
That you're completely bonkers.

1205
01:20:36,627 --> 01:20:38,122
Completely?

1206
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:43,127
There's maybe two brain cells
that still light up.

1207
01:20:43,301 --> 01:20:45,127
Rest is just...

1208
01:20:45,302 --> 01:20:47,793
...short circuits and sparks.

1209
01:20:47,971 --> 01:20:49,716
Two?

1210
01:20:52,435 --> 01:20:57,014
Listen, when you go to pick up
your next paycheck...

1211
01:20:57,189 --> 01:21:00,807
...there will be a substantial difference
this time.

1212
01:21:00,985 --> 01:21:04,069
I get some sort of bonus for this--?

1213
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:09,067
For this having happened to me on duty?

1214
01:21:09,243 --> 01:21:12,279
No. Read your penal code.

1215
01:21:12,456 --> 01:21:17,082
An officer who willingly becomes an
addict and doesn't report it promptly...

1216
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:19,375
...is subject to a misdemeanor charge...

1217
01:21:19,671 --> 01:21:22,506
...a fine, and/or six months. 

1218
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:25,796
You'll probably just be fined.

1219
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:27,463
Willingly?

1220
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,841
No one held a gun to your head
and shot you up.

1221
01:21:32,016 --> 01:21:34,010
No one dropped something in your soup.

1222
01:21:34,185 --> 01:21:37,222
You knowingly and willingly
took an addictive drug...

1223
01:21:37,398 --> 01:21:39,805
...brain-destructive and disorienting.

1224
01:21:39,984 --> 01:21:41,525
I had to.

1225
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:44,440
You could have pretended to.

1226
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:47,234
Most officers manage to cope with it.

1227
01:21:48,701 --> 01:21:53,695
And from the quantities
you were taking... .

1228
01:21:53,872 --> 01:21:57,372
My God, Fred, I... .

1229
01:21:57,542 --> 01:22:01,375
Hey, you know what I would do
if I were you?

1230
01:22:01,672 --> 01:22:04,876
Once you get out of New Path and,
you know, it's all over--

1231
01:22:05,051 --> 01:22:07,007
But it may never be over.

1232
01:22:09,389 --> 01:22:10,551
Cigarette?

1233
01:22:12,182 --> 01:22:15,350
I'm getting off that too. Everything.

1234
01:22:16,104 --> 01:22:18,429
Including chocolate. Yeah.

1235
01:22:19,356 --> 01:22:20,935
And... .

1236
01:22:21,234 --> 01:22:23,060
Like I tell my kids... .

1237
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:27,947
I've got two kids. Two girls.

1238
01:22:28,742 --> 01:22:30,021
Little ones.

1239
01:22:32,912 --> 01:22:35,319
I don't believe you do.

1240
01:22:37,292 --> 01:22:39,414
You're not supposed to.

1241
01:22:40,628 --> 01:22:41,957
Maybe not.

1242
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:06,442
Listen, is there anywhere specific
you'd like to go?

1243
01:23:07,864 --> 01:23:11,032
Maybe over to
Donna Hawthorne's place?

1244
01:23:11,202 --> 01:23:15,744
From the information you brought in,
sounds like you guys are pretty close.

1245
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:20,166
Yes, we are.

1246
01:23:21,378 --> 01:23:22,658
How'd you know that?

1247
01:23:23,088 --> 01:23:25,923
Process of elimination.

1248
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:28,510
I know who you aren't...

1249
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:31,639
...and we're talking about
a very small group of people...

1250
01:23:31,805 --> 01:23:34,095
...that we hoped would lead us higher.

1251
01:23:34,266 --> 01:23:36,010
And maybe Barris will.

1252
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:40,143
I pieced it together a long time ago
that you're Arctor.

1253
01:23:43,652 --> 01:23:45,524
I'm who?

1254
01:23:48,532 --> 01:23:50,654
I'm Bob Arctor?

1255
01:23:54,246 --> 01:23:56,951
Yeah, get me
Donna Hawthorne's number...

1256
01:23:57,123 --> 01:23:59,496
...or just patch me through
when you locate her.

1257
01:24:00,418 --> 01:24:01,663
Thanks.

1258
01:24:01,837 --> 01:24:05,420
Bud, you are in a very bad way,
my friend.

1259
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:07,582
Maybe Jim Barris poisoned you.

1260
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,381
We're really interested in Barris,
not you.

1261
01:24:10,554 --> 01:24:14,171
The whole scanning of the house
was to keep an eye on him.

1262
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:19,724
We hoped to draw him here, and we did.

1263
01:24:20,396 --> 01:24:24,726
He is deep into it
with some very dangerous people.

1264
01:24:26,112 --> 01:24:29,694
Then I'm a what?

1265
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:32,320
Well, we had to get to Barris
to set him up.

1266
01:24:32,493 --> 01:24:34,615
So how we arranged it was...

1267
01:24:34,787 --> 01:24:37,740
...he grew progressively
more and more suspicious...

1268
01:24:37,914 --> 01:24:39,707
...that you were an undercover cop...

1269
01:24:39,876 --> 01:24:42,367
...trying to nail him
or use him to get high or--

1270
01:24:42,545 --> 01:24:45,913
So he did what you or anyone
would have done.

1271
01:24:46,215 --> 01:24:47,329
Hey, Donna.

1272
01:24:47,716 --> 01:24:51,585
Yeah, hi, this is a buddy of Bob's.
Arctor.

1273
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:53,884
Yeah.

1274
01:24:54,056 --> 01:24:58,268
Listen, he's in a-- He's in a bad way.

1275
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,887
Yeah, way bad.

1276
01:25:02,064 --> 01:25:06,063
I was wondering if I could
ask a favor of you.

1277
01:25:07,154 --> 01:25:08,399
You're a sweetheart.

1278
01:25:08,988 --> 01:25:12,606
Yeah, I'm sure he'll
appreciate it very much.

1279
01:25:12,783 --> 01:25:15,274
Great, thanks. Good news.

1280
01:25:15,453 --> 01:25:19,533
Donna Hawthorne said she'd pick you up
out front in about five minutes.

1281
01:25:22,168 --> 01:25:24,789
You fuckers.

1282
01:26:24,690 --> 01:26:27,311
You're a good man, Bob.

1283
01:26:27,903 --> 01:26:30,274
You've been dealt a bad deal.

1284
01:26:30,447 --> 01:26:34,360
This is not fair, but it has to be this way.

1285
01:26:34,533 --> 01:26:35,814
You just--

1286
01:26:35,993 --> 01:26:40,073
You gotta-- You gotta just wait it out,
just get through it.

1287
01:26:40,248 --> 01:26:42,372
And someday...

1288
01:26:42,876 --> 01:26:45,449
...a long time from now...

1289
01:26:46,003 --> 01:26:47,796
...you'll see the way you saw before.

1290
01:26:49,048 --> 01:26:51,836
There'll be a recognition...

1291
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:57,349
...and some spark in a disguised form...

1292
01:26:57,515 --> 01:26:59,555
...will reveal itself to you...

1293
01:27:00,478 --> 01:27:02,765
...and guide you.

1294
01:27:28,131 --> 01:27:30,668
-Substance D?
-Yeah.

1295
01:27:31,341 --> 01:27:33,216
Ate his head.

1296
01:27:33,386 --> 01:27:35,177
Another loser.

1297
01:27:36,055 --> 01:27:37,764
It's easy to win.

1298
01:27:39,725 --> 01:27:41,552
Anybody can win.

1299
01:27:50,278 --> 01:27:52,021
Goodbye.

1300
01:28:00,372 --> 01:28:04,500
Living and unliving things
are exchanging properties.

1301
01:28:05,377 --> 01:28:10,833
The drive of unliving things is stronger
than the drive of living things.

1302
01:28:13,301 --> 01:28:18,260
The living should never be used
to serve the purposes of the dead.

1303
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,811
But the dead should, if possible...

1304
01:28:23,979 --> 01:28:27,430
...serve the purposes of the living.

1305
01:28:43,582 --> 01:28:44,993
Hey, good news.

1306
01:28:45,167 --> 01:28:47,574
I think I got you transferred
to one of our farms.

1307
01:28:47,962 --> 01:28:50,998
-Can I work with animals?
-I think you'll be working with plants...

1308
01:28:51,173 --> 01:28:53,961
...for a while. In the open,
where you can touch the ground.

1309
01:28:54,135 --> 01:28:57,171
-I wanna be with something living.
-The ground is living.

1310
01:28:57,346 --> 01:28:59,470
The earth is still alive.

1311
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,261
Do you have
any agricultural background?

1312
01:29:02,435 --> 01:29:03,930
I worked in an office.

1313
01:29:04,895 --> 01:29:07,137
Well, you'll be outside from now on.

1314
01:29:31,422 --> 01:29:33,131
Your name is Bruce.

1315
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:35,458
My name is Bruce.

1316
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:39,882
We're gonna try you on farming
for a period, Bruce.

1317
01:29:40,056 --> 01:29:43,841
-Okay.
-Staff thought you'd be better off.

1318
01:29:44,019 --> 01:29:46,261
I think you'll like it here.

1319
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:48,726
I think I'll like it here.

1320
01:29:49,817 --> 01:29:52,569
Come on, I'll show you
where you're gonna be sleeping.

1321
01:29:53,613 --> 01:29:55,770
You like mountains, Bruce?

1322
01:29:55,948 --> 01:29:57,193
Look up.

1323
01:29:57,365 --> 01:29:58,990
Mountains.

1324
01:29:59,159 --> 01:30:02,030
No snow, but mountains.

1325
01:30:02,204 --> 01:30:03,864
I like mountains.

1326
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:06,364
The air is good here.

1327
01:30:06,876 --> 01:30:08,750
I like air.

1328
01:30:09,587 --> 01:30:10,832
Yeah.

1329
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:14,291
We all like air, Bruce. We really do.

1330
01:30:14,466 --> 01:30:16,792
That we have in common.

1331
01:30:19,889 --> 01:30:21,716
4G.

1332
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:23,717
Yours is 4G. Can you remember that?

1333
01:30:23,893 --> 01:30:25,554
4G.

1334
01:30:27,771 --> 01:30:29,564
Will I be seeing my friends?

1335
01:30:30,149 --> 01:30:32,557
What, you mean
from back where you were?

1336
01:30:32,735 --> 01:30:34,444
The Santa Ana facility?

1337
01:30:35,822 --> 01:30:37,233
Mike and Laura...

1338
01:30:37,407 --> 01:30:40,942
...and Mike and Eddie. And--

1339
01:30:41,118 --> 01:30:43,408
The people from
the residence facilities...

1340
01:30:43,579 --> 01:30:45,952
...they don't come out
to the farms, Bruce.

1341
01:30:46,125 --> 01:30:49,576
-See, these are closed operations.
-Closed operations.

1342
01:30:49,752 --> 01:30:52,837
But, you know,
you might get back up there...

1343
01:30:53,006 --> 01:30:54,583
...couple times a year.

1344
01:30:54,757 --> 01:30:57,332
You know,
there are gatherings at Christmas...

1345
01:30:57,511 --> 01:30:59,219
...and the next one is Thanksgiving.

1346
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:00,586
Thanksgiving.

1347
01:31:00,764 --> 01:31:03,967
So you might see them in three months.

1348
01:31:17,489 --> 01:31:19,363
Hey, Audrey.

1349
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:21,614
Glad you could meet.

1350
01:31:22,537 --> 01:31:25,573
So tell me, are they
getting paranoid about him?

1351
01:31:25,747 --> 01:31:28,322
No, not at all. The guy's so burnt-out.

1352
01:31:30,127 --> 01:31:32,796
And we're still convinced
they're growing the stuff?

1353
01:31:33,131 --> 01:31:35,917
They have to be. Who else?

1354
01:31:37,301 --> 01:31:40,302
I just wonder
if it even matters at this--

1355
01:31:40,471 --> 01:31:43,756
It matters, Audrey.

1356
01:31:43,934 --> 01:31:46,970
It matters when we can prove
that New Path is the one growing...

1357
01:31:47,145 --> 01:31:48,971
...manufacturing and distributing.

1358
01:31:50,481 --> 01:31:52,475
How does he look?

1359
01:31:53,275 --> 01:31:56,479
I mean, do you think he's gonna
be able to pull through for us?

1360
01:31:56,654 --> 01:31:59,359
All we can do is hope
that when he finally gets in there...

1361
01:31:59,533 --> 01:32:04,324
...a few charred brain cells will flicker on
and some distant instinct will kick in.

1362
01:32:04,496 --> 01:32:05,989
It's just... .

1363
01:32:06,622 --> 01:32:10,288
-It's just such a cost to pay.
-Yeah.

1364
01:32:10,668 --> 01:32:12,828
But there's no other way to get in there.

1365
01:32:13,005 --> 01:32:16,006
I couldn't, and think how long I tried.

1366
01:32:16,382 --> 01:32:18,042
They got that place locked up tight.

1367
01:32:18,219 --> 01:32:21,469
They're only gonna let a burnt-out husk
like Bruce in.

1368
01:32:21,639 --> 01:32:25,137
Harmless. You have to be,
or they won't take the risk.

1369
01:32:25,309 --> 01:32:28,144
Yeah, but to sacrifice someone...

1370
01:32:28,311 --> 01:32:31,479
...a living person,
without them ever knowing it.

1371
01:32:31,649 --> 01:32:34,899
I mean, if he'd understood,
if he had volunteered...

1372
01:32:35,069 --> 01:32:36,978
...but he doesn't know and he never did.

1373
01:32:37,154 --> 01:32:39,313
He didn't volunteer for this.

1374
01:32:39,489 --> 01:32:42,028
Sure he did. It was his job.

1375
01:32:42,201 --> 01:32:44,573
It wasn't his job to get addicted.

1376
01:32:45,496 --> 01:32:47,239
We took care of that.

1377
01:32:47,414 --> 01:32:49,537
Look, Mike, I gotta get out.

1378
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:51,997
I can't do this again.

1379
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:55,087
I want it to end. I--

1380
01:32:55,256 --> 01:32:57,961
I lay in bed at night, and I can't sleep,
and I just think:

1381
01:32:58,134 --> 01:33:01,882
-Shit, we are colder than they are. 
-I don't think so.

1382
01:33:02,055 --> 01:33:04,971
I mean, I believe God's m.o.
is to transmute evil into good...

1383
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:07,893
...and if he's active here,
he's doing that now...

1384
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:10,386
...although our eyes can't perceive it.

1385
01:33:10,564 --> 01:33:13,766
The whole process is hidden
beneath the surface of our reality...

1386
01:33:13,942 --> 01:33:16,515
...will only be revealed later.

1387
01:33:17,112 --> 01:33:18,903
And even then...

1388
01:33:19,072 --> 01:33:21,279
...the people of the future...

1389
01:33:21,449 --> 01:33:25,033
...our children's children
will never truly know...

1390
01:33:25,203 --> 01:33:28,952
...this awful time that we have
gone through and the losses we took.

1391
01:33:30,708 --> 01:33:33,876
Well, maybe some footnote
in a minor history book.

1392
01:33:35,171 --> 01:33:37,746
A brief mention
with no list of the fallen.

1393
01:34:24,139 --> 01:34:26,463
You're seeing the flower of the future.

1394
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:30,386
-But not for you, Bruce.
-Not for me.

1395
01:34:30,686 --> 01:34:33,177
No, you've had too much
of a good thing already.

1396
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:37,442
Get up, get up. Stop worshipping.

1397
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:40,398
This isn't your god anymore,
although it once was.

1398
01:34:41,489 --> 01:34:43,032
Gone.

1399
01:34:43,908 --> 01:34:45,865
Flowers gone.

1400
01:34:46,036 --> 01:34:47,993
No, you just can't see them.

1401
01:34:48,162 --> 01:34:49,907
Back to work.

1402
01:34:53,085 --> 01:34:54,496
I saw.

1403
01:34:55,421 --> 01:34:57,993
Back to work, Bruce.

1404
01:35:02,136 --> 01:35:05,421
I saw death rising from the earth...

1405
01:35:07,099 --> 01:35:09,555
...from the ground itself...

1406
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:15,813
...in one blue field.

1407
01:35:20,738 --> 01:35:23,655
A present for my friends...

1408
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:26,323
...at Thanksgiving.
