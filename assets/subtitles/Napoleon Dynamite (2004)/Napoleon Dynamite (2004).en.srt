1
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,588
<i>What are you gonna do today, Napoleon?</i>

2
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,129
Whatever I feel like I want to do. Gosh!

3
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,983
<i>Your current event, Napoleon.</i>

4
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,733
Last week, Japanese scientists "explaced"...

5
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,434
placed explosive detonators
at the bottom of Lake Loch Ness...

6
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,568
to blow Nessie out of the water.

7
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,719
Sir Curt Godfrey of the Nessie Alliance...

8
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,221
summoned the help of Scotland's local wizards...

9
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:01,817
<i>to cast a protective spell over the lake
and its local residents...</i>

10
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:07,025
and all those who seek for
the peaceful existence of our underwater ally.

11
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,752
Yes. Yes.

12
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,821
Yes. Yes.

13
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,318
Hey, Napoleon, what'd you do all last summer again?

14
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:38,261
<i>I told you. I spent it with my uncle
in Alaska hunting wolverines.</i>

15
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,458
- Did you shoot any?
- Yes, like 50 of'em.

16
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,503
<i>They kept tryin'to attack my cousins. What
the heck would you do in a situation like that?</i>

17
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:50,406
- What kind of gun did you use?
- A frickin' 12-gauge. What do you think?

18
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,035
You think you're funny?
Just watch your step.

19
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,444
But I didn't...

20
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,118
Hey, could I use your guys's phone for a sec?

21
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,557
- Is there anything wrong?
- I don't feel very good.

22
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,952
- Hi.
- Is Grandma there?

23
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,318
No, she's getting her hair done.

24
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,219
- What do you need?
- Can you just go get her for me?

25
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,663
- I'm really busy right now.
- Well, just tell her to come get me.

26
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,736
- Why?
- 'Cause I don't feel good.

27
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:54,534
- Well, have you talked to the school nurse?
- No, she doesn't know anything.

28
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,666
- Will you just come get me?
- No.

29
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,711
Well, will you do me a favor then?

30
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,576
- What?
- Can you bring me my ChapStick?

31
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,242
- No, Napoleon.
- But my lips hurt real bad.

32
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:09,082
Just borrow some from the school nurse.
I know she has, like, five sticks in her drawer.

33
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,679
I'm not gonna use hers, you sicko.

34
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,691
See ya.

35
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,728
Idiot!

36
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,159
<i>David Dempke, please come to the offiice.</i>

37
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,100
<i>- David Dempke.
- You do understand English?</i>

38
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,866
This isn't that complex.
Look, the cafeteria's down the hall...

39
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,965
to the right and downstairs.

40
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,435
Hey, is that a new kid or something?

41
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,446
Napoleon, this is Pedro.

42
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,709
Would you mind showing him where his locker is?

43
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,751
Sure. Come on.

44
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:48,018
You know, there's, like,
a buttload of gangs at this school.

45
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,120
This one gang kept wanting me to join
'cause I'm pretty good with a bow staff.

46
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,235
Do you ride the bus to school?

47
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,236
No. I ride my bike.

48
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,398
- What kind of bike do you have?
- It's a Sledgehammer.

49
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,601
Dang!

50
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,575
<i>You got shocks, pegs.</i>

51
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,374
Lucky!

52
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,946
You ever take it off any sweet jumps?

53
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,494
You got, like, three feet of air that time.

54
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,665
Can I try it really quick?

55
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,973
Dang it!

56
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,406
I love the way...

57
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,501
your sandy hair...

58
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,172
<i>floats in the air.</i>

59
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,909
<i>To me it's like a lullaby.</i>

60
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,953
<i>I'm just flying by, oh, so high...</i>

61
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,853
like a kite tied to a stake.

62
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,596
How was school?

63
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,166
The worst day of my life.
What do you think?

64
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,532
Well, I want you to go see ifTina wants some of this.

65
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,601
Kip hasn't done flipping anything today.

66
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,304
Look, tonight me and your...
Kip, listen!

67
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,379
What?

68
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,381
Tonight me and your aunt are
gonna go visit some friends...

69
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,383
and we're not gonna be back till tomorrow.

70
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:23,285
We're gettin' low on steak, so I got Lyle
comin' over tomorrow to take care of it.

71
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,187
- Well, what's there to eat?
- Knock it off, Napoleon.

72
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,260
Make yourself a dang quesadilla!

73
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,386
<i>Fine!</i>

74
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,430
I'll be back tomorrow.

75
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,302
Stay home and eat all the freakin' chips, Kip!

76
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:46,572
Napoleon, don't be jealous that I've been
chatting online with babes all day.

77
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,080
Besides, we both know
I'm training to become a cage fighter.

78
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,844
Since when, Kip?
You have the worst reflexes of all time.

79
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,079
- Try and hit me, Napoleon.
- What?

80
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,156
I said come down here and see
what happens if you try and hit me.

81
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,488
Such an idiot.

82
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,723
Let me see what your best move is.

83
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,700
I'll go get it.

84
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,777
Geez!

85
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,586
Um, hello.

86
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,451
Would you like to look like this?

87
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,721
This is a girl.

88
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,489
Because for a limited time only...

89
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,032
glamour shots by Deb are 75% off.

90
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,625
I already get my hair cut at the Cuttin' Corral.

91
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:50,232
Well, maybe you'd be interested
in some home-woven handicrafts.

92
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,810
<i>...- I'm Rex...</i>

93
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,073
founder of the Rex Kwon Do Self-Defense System.

94
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:59,049
After one week with me in my dojo,
you'll be prepared to defend yourself...

95
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,278
with the strength of a grizzly...

96
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:05,483
The reflexes of a puma...

97
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,821
and the wisdom of a man.

98
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,157
Come down today for your free trial lesson!

99
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,761
In here we have some boondoggle key chains.

100
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,601
A must-have for this season's fashion.

101
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,437
I already made, like, infinity of those at Scout camp.

102
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,534
Well, is anyone else here?

103
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,909
I'm trying to earn money for college.

104
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,482
<i>Your mom goes to college.</i>

105
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,417
<i>Let's bring in that...</i>

106
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,937
Tina, you fat lard.
Come get some dinner.

107
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,241
Tina, eat.
Eat the food.

108
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,412
Eat the food!

109
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,868
It'd be nice if you could pull me into town.

110
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,546
My name is Rex, and if you study
with my eight-week program...

111
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,591
you will learn a system of self-defense...

112
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,490
that I developed over two seasons
of fighting in the Octagon.

113
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,564
It's called Rex Kwon Do!

114
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,532
I need a volunteer.

115
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,966
<i>Okay, you'll do.
Come up here.</i>

116
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,871
Bow to your sensei.
Bow to your sensei!

117
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,874
Okay.

118
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,002
Now, I'm gonna give you one chance.

119
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,740
One chance, people.
Give me your best shot.

120
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,346
All right.
That was pretty good. Okay.

121
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,389
<i>Now, watch this, everybody.</i>

122
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,617
Grab my arm.
The other arm.

123
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,660
<i>My other arm.</i>

124
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,525
Now watch this. I'm just gonna break
the wrist and walk away.

125
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,531
Break the wrist, walk away.

126
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,692
- Geez!
- Okay.

127
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,498
It's just that simple.
Now, I want you to kick me.

128
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,664
Come on. Kick me.

129
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,741
Okay, do it again.

130
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,902
Do it again.

131
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,845
- Ouch.
- Okay. You'll block it every time.

132
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,542
Have a seat.

133
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,915
<i>Now, in addition to what you just saw...</i>

134
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,751
<i>if you study with my eight-week program,
you're gonna learn these things.</i>

135
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,791
First off...

136
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,793
Rex Kwon Do, we use the buddy system.

137
00:14:55,895 --> 00:15:00,389
<i>No more flyin'solo. You need somebody
watching your back at all times.!</i>

138
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,730
<i>Second off, you're gonna learn to discipline your image.</i>

139
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,804
Do you think I got where I am today...

140
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,600
because I dress like Peter Pan here?

141
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,102
<i>Take a look at what I'm wearing, people.</i>

142
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,644
Do you think anybody wants
a roundhouse kick to the face...

143
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,510
while I'm wearin' these bad boys?

144
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,743
Forget about it.
Last off...

145
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,879
my students will learn about self-respect.

146
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:28,426
Do you think anybody thinks I'm a failure
because I go home to Starla at night?

147
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,995
<i>Forget about it.!</i>

148
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,031
Now, for only $300, you can sign up right now...

149
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,363
for my eight-week program.

150
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,110
Well, that place was a rip-off.

151
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,664
Hey, Lyle.

152
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,837
Nothin' on here works smooth.

153
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,127
So me and you are pretty much friends by now, right?

154
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,129
Yes.

155
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,461
So, you got my back and everything?

156
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,000
What?

157
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,472
<i>Never mind.</i>

158
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,134
- Have you heard about the dance?
- Yes.

159
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,643
Have you met anyone to ask yet?

160
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,307
<i>No. But I probably will after school.</i>

161
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,646
Who you gonna ask?

162
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,778
That girl over there.

163
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,186
She braided my hair one time...

164
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,486
Summer Wheatly?
How the heck are you gonna do that?

165
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,255
Build her a cake or something.

166
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,865
Yeah, my old girlfriend from Oklahoma...

167
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,900
was gonna fly out here for the dance...

168
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,697
but she couldn't 'cause she's doing
some modeling right now.

169
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,329
Is she hot?

170
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,346
See for yourself.

171
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,539
Wow.

172
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,314
<i>Yeah, I took her to the mall to get
some glamour shots for her birthday one year.</i>

173
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,052
- I like her bangs.
- Me too.

174
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,795
How long did it take you to grow that mustache?

175
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,869
A couple of days.

176
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,234
I wish I could grow one.

177
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,678
Are you gonna eat your Tots?

178
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,543
No.

179
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,911
Can I have 'em?

180
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,106
You see that girl over there?

181
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,946
<i>She came over to my house the other day.</i>

182
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,020
<i>- Why?
- I don't know...</i>

183
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,749
but she left all this crap on my porch.

184
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,684
She's pretty good-looking.

185
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,853
Do you dare me to go talk to her?

186
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,124
Sure.

187
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:16,043
<i>I see you're drinking one-percent.
Is that 'cause you think you're fat?</i>

188
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:21,880
<i>'Cause you're not. You could be
drinking whole if you wanted to.</i>

189
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:27,625
<i>Well, I have all your equipment in my locker.</i>

190
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,958
You should probably come get it 'cause
I can't fit my nunchakus in there anymore.

191
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,333
Where's your locker?

192
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,774
Hey, can I have one of your key chains?

193
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,363
Whoo!

194
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,270
Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!

195
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,129
Hello?

196
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,729
Napoleon, give me some of your Tots.

197
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,856
- No, go find your own.
- Come on. Give me some of your Tots.

198
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,060
No. I'm freakin' starved.
I didn't get to eat anything today.

199
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,661
G...

200
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,172
Gross.

201
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:26,335
Freakin' idiot!

202
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,315
Tina, come get some ham.

203
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,209
What are you doing here, Uncle Rico?

204
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,980
Your grandma took a little spill at
the sand dunes today, broke her coccyx.

205
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,988
What? Since when does she go to the dunes?

206
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,664
Looks like there's a lot you don't know about her.

207
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,272
<i>- So, when's Grandma coming back?
- I don't know.</i>

208
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,474
Not sure.

209
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,483
You don't have to stay here with us.
We're not babies.

210
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,021
Talk to your Auntie Caroline.

211
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,818
<i>Well, Kip is, like, 32 years old.</i>

212
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,825
I don't mind if you stay.

213
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,157
Oh. Thanks, Kip.

214
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,290
<i>What the flip was Grandma doin'at the sand dunes?</i>

215
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,927
She was on a date...
with her boyfriend.

216
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,198
Boyfriend?

217
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,509
Hey, you guys want to see my video?

218
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,625
So, what do you think?

219
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,796
- It's pretty cool, I guess.
- Oh.

220
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,101
Man, I wish I could go back in time.

221
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,473
I'd take state.

222
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,876
This is pretty much the worst video ever made.

223
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,040
Napoleon, like anyone can even know that.

224
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,278
You know what, Napoleon?
You can leave.

225
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,354
You guys are retarded.

226
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:52,480
Hah!

227
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,855
Hey, check that out.

228
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,274
<i>So, you and Tammy still together?</i>

229
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:14,539
<i>No. Not really.</i>

230
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,141
- Why is that?
- Well...

231
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,785
she's jealous.

232
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,685
Says I'm livin' too much in '82.

233
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,689
Well, I dumped her.

234
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,886
What about your girlfriend?

235
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,625
Well, things are gettin' pretty serious right now.

236
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,930
I mean, we chat online for, like, two hours every day...

237
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,472
so I guess you could say
things are gettin' pretty serious.

238
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:47,273
<i>I'm just really tryin'to raise a few bucks right
now so I can bring her around for a few days.</i>

239
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,246
Yep. Well, what's she look like?

240
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,681
<i>She's, uh...
She's got sandy blonde hair.</i>

241
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,685
She's, uh, pretty-look...

242
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,721
pretty good-looking face, but...

243
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:00,017
I'm just gettin' really...
just kinda T.O.'d...

244
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,993
because, I mean, she hasn't even
sent me a full body shot yet.

245
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,700
<i>Hey, you know...</i>

246
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,769
I got a little project...

247
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,431
that we might be able to make a little moola with.

248
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,839
Really? That sounds pretty good.

249
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,845
Have you ever heard of nylon polymer?

250
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,083
Go for it.

251
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:03,620
Back in '82, I used to be able
to throw a pigskin a quarter mile.

252
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,452
- Are you serious?
- I'm dead serious.

253
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,128
Watch this.

254
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,002
What the heck are you doing?

255
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,969
That's what I'm talkin' about.

256
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,040
I better go.

257
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:36,111
How much you want to make a bet I can
throw a football over them mountains?

258
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,758
Yeah. If coach would've put me in fourth quarter...

259
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,692
we'd have been state champions, no doubt.

260
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,628
No doubt in my mind.

261
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,029
You better believe things would have been different.

262
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:52,262
I'd have gone pro...
in a heartbeat.

263
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,668
I'd be makin' millions of dollars and...

264
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:59,142
livin' in a...
big ol' mansion somewhere.

265
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,805
You know, soakin' it up in a hot tub with my soul mate.

266
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,918
Kip...

267
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,047
I reckon you know a lot about cyberspace.

268
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,386
Y- You ever come across anything like time travel?

269
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,464
Easy.

270
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,432
I've already looked into it for myself.

271
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,995
Right on.

272
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,041
Right on.

273
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,408
Is Pedro here today?

274
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,103
I don't think so. Why?

275
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,442
Just wondering.

276
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,742
Can you, uh, give this to him for me?

277
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,775
Okay.

278
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,583
<i>Hey, Summer, you want to play me?</i>

279
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,819
Mm-mmm.

280
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,166
Ow. God.

281
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,782
- What are you drawing?
- A liger.

282
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,980
What's a liger?

283
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,455
<i>It's pretty much my favorite animal.</i>

284
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,685
It's like a lion and a tiger mixed.

285
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,194
Bred for its skills in magic.

286
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,264
Hmm.

287
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,799
Where's your friend?

288
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,203
I don't know.
Did you see him today?

289
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,901
No.

290
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,978
Neither did I.

291
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,013
<i>- Do you need a ride?
- No.</i>

292
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,983
I missed the bus today, but my uncle's coming to get me.

293
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,885
<i>Oh.</i>

294
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,255
See ya.

295
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,407
<i>Right. I... I think...</i>

296
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,774
<i>just a little bit east of the cemetery
is a good little area right here.</i>

297
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,212
We should do it there. Don't go down here,
'cause they don't have any money.

298
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,547
<i>So, how long are we talkin'about workin'?</i>

299
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,382
<i>What are you...
You're already losing your steam?</i>

300
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,855
No. I just...
I have a chat room meeting at 4:00.

301
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,893
I gotta be back here by then.

302
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,259
- All right, you just start a little earlier. That's all.
- All right.

303
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,855
Or else work afterwards.
How long's the chat room?

304
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,130
Geez, sometimes up to three, four hours maybe.

305
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,373
Maybe not.
I don't know.

306
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,442
You... You pay the bills for that?

307
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,637
Does that cost money every time
you're on, like for minutes on the phone?

308
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,646
Yeah. Grandma's still payin' per minute.

309
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,808
She gets kind of pissed at me
sometimes 'cause I'm on there so long.

310
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,785
I'll bet she does.
I'd be throwin' you out the window.

311
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,653
<i>- Bueno.
- Hello?</i>

312
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,058
- Who's this?
- Napoleon Dynamite.

313
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,562
- Who?
- Napoleon Dynamite.

314
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:44,066
- I'm one of Pedro's best friends.
- Your name is Napoleon?

315
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,329
Yes. Is Pedro there?

316
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,428
No, he's not here right now.

317
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,507
Okay, bye.

318
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,177
See, Crystal Street.
That's for you.

319
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,976
<i>I'm goin'to Adams Park.
They got some money in Adams Park.</i>

320
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,510
What?

321
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,520
Let's go, Kipper.
I think we should take this...

322
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,113
- someplace a little more private.
- That's a good idea.

323
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,352
<i>Please. Please. Be good to me.</i>

324
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,861
<i>Please, keep going.
Dead on. Dead on.</i>

325
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,227
Yes!

326
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,436
<i>Before we get started on our new project,
I have a few concerns.</i>

327
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,846
First off, I'm concerned about
your transportation situation.

328
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,319
I mean, do you... you got a car
you can borrow from someone?

329
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,322
Well, that's the problem right now.

330
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,324
At the moment, nothing comes to mind.

331
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:52,793
<i>You can borrow my van for the time being.
I... I do better on foot anyway.</i>

332
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:56,704
We also need some way to make us
look official, like we got all the answers.

333
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,174
How about some gold bracelets?

334
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,379
We need, like, some name tags...

335
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,573
with our picture on it, all laminated and whatnot.

336
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,582
I mean, we gotta look legit, man.

337
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,584
<i>That's true. That's true.</i>

338
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,382
<i>Say, you know of a... a place
we can get our picture taken...</i>

339
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,389
like a... a photo store?

340
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,391
Okay.

341
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,087
Turn your head on more of a slant.

342
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,592
<i>Now, make a fist...</i>

343
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,861
and slowly ease it up underneath your chin.

344
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,673
- This is looking really good.
- You can say that again.

345
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,937
<i>Okay, hold still right there.</i>

346
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,573
Now, just imagine you're weightless.

347
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,846
You're in the middle of the ocean...

348
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,923
surrounded by tiny little sea horses.

349
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:56,021
That was the one. I think
that's gonna come out really nice.

350
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,592
Uh, you did it?

351
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,435
Wow. Wow, that felt really relaxed.

352
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,441
Thanks, Deb.

353
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:09,411
You're up, Kip.

354
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,446
Is there some kind of vest that I can wear?

355
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,894
- Where have you been?
- I got sick.

356
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,992
Has Summer said anything to you yet?

357
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,263
No, not yet.

358
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,168
Well, she said no.

359
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,173
She did?

360
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,635
- Well, what about that other girl?
- What other girl?

361
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,806
- The one that left all that crap on your porch.
- You mean Deb?

362
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,510
<i>- Yes, her.
- What about her?</i>

363
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,416
- Well, I asked her out too.
- What?

364
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,612
<i>Well, nobody's gonna go out with me.</i>

365
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,519
- Have you asked anybody yet?
- No, but who would?

366
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,995
- I don't even have any good skills.
- What do you mean?

367
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,464
You know, like...

368
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,593
nunchaku skills, bow hunting skills...

369
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,934
computer hacking skills.

370
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,675
Girls only want boyfriends who have great skills.

371
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,971
<i>Aren't you pretty good at drawing, like...</i>

372
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,979
animals and warriors and stuff?

373
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,242
Yes.

374
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,682
Probably the best that I know of.

375
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:57,413
Just draw a picture of the girl you want to take out...

376
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,150
and give it to her for, like, a gift or something.

377
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,523
That's a pretty good idea.

378
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:34,124
Now, if you invest in the 24-piece set...

379
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,693
I'm gonna throw in a little gift.

380
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,058
So, what's the gift?

381
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:44,360
I bet you folks don't have one of these.

382
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,568
I want that.

383
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,668
You see, this ain't your run-of-the-mill "crapper-ware."

384
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:58,408
These are some serious "NuPont" fiber-woven bowls.

385
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,508
<i>So, if we purchase the 24-piece set...</i>

386
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,553
the mini sailboat is included?

387
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,747
That's correct, sir.

388
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,984
<i>Lance, you look like a strong young pup.</i>

389
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,955
Why don't you see if you can give that a nice tear.

390
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,602
<i>Don't hurt yourself now.</i>

391
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,643
I can't do it.

392
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,905
Can't.

393
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,774
So, uh...

394
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,352
how does the "dealio" sound to you?

395
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,197
Dang it.

396
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:20,355
- Is Trisha here?
- Oh, I'm sorry, she's not.

397
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,661
<i>- She's at a friend's house right now.
- Well, hey, Napoleon.</i>

398
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:30,798
- Napoleon's my nephew.
- Oh, that's nice.

399
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,376
Could you just give this to her for me?

400
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:38,244
- I certainly could.
- Thanks.

401
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,283
Bye-bye.

402
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:47,749
Poor kid. I've been takin' care of him
while his grandma's in the hospital.

403
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,393
He still wets the bed and everything.

404
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,395
You're kidding.

405
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:57,433
Yeah, he's a tender little guy.
He still gets beat up and whatnot.

406
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,165
Anyway, uh...

407
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:07,108
so we still feelin' pretty good about this,
uh, 32-piece set here?

408
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:10,180
- Ow!
- What the crap was Uncle Rico doin' at my girlfriend's house?

409
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:13,182
Napoleon, let go of me!
I think you're bruisin' my neck meat!

410
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,546
Fine.

411
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,620
<i>What the heck are you guys doin'?</i>

412
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:20,213
Tryin' to ruin my life
and make me look like a friggin' idiot?

413
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,622
I'm out makin' some sweet moola with Uncle Rico.

414
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,786
Geez, I think you ripped my mole off.

415
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,955
- I did?
- Yeah, is it bleeding?

416
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,999
<i>A little bit.</i>

417
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,035
<i>Hey, Kip.</i>

418
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,974
<i>I wish you wouldn't look at me like that, Napoleon.</i>

419
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,636
I wish you'd get out of my life and shut up.

420
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:45,045
I'm gonna tell you somethin'. While you're playin'
patty-cake with your friend Pedro...

421
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,879
your Uncle Rico...
is makin' 120 bucks.

422
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,579
<i>I could make that much money in five seconds.</i>

423
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,714
<i>Geez. Yeah, right, Napoleon.
I made, like, 75 bucks today.</i>

424
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,255
<i>Napoleon, it looks like you don't have a job.</i>

425
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,329
So why don't you get out there and feed Tina.

426
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,660
Why don't you go eat a "decroded" piece of crap.

427
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,032
<i>There's a lot more where this came from...</i>

428
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,073
<i>if you go to the dance with me.</i>

429
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,642
<i>Yours truly, Napoleon Dynamite.</i>

430
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,713
You know you're gonna go to that dance with that boy.

431
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:31,320
<i>By noon I need them 8,000 hens moved into their new cages.</i>

432
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,694
<i>Sometimes they don't want to cooperate.</i>

433
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:38,291
But you give 'em a good shakin',
they'll settle down for ya.

434
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,666
Do the chickens have large talons?

435
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,171
- Do they have what?
- Large talons.

436
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,209
I don't understand a word you just said.

437
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,140
<i>Okay, you meet me back here about noon, and, uh...</i>

438
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,647
we'll have a little lunch waitin' for ya.

439
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,224
Ew!

440
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,778
Well, dig in.

441
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,100
Over there, in that pigpen...

442
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,007
<i>I found a couple of Shoshoni arrowheads.</i>

443
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:43,791
Can't find my checkbook.
Hope you don't mind I pay you in change.

444
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,226
Six dollars.

445
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,903
That's, like, a dollar an hour.

446
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,404
Hello?

447
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,071
- Hi. Is Napoleon there?
- Yes.

448
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,844
- Can I talk to him?
- You already are.

449
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,920
Oh.

450
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,217
Napoleon, this is Trisha.

451
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,485
I'm just calling to tell you that...

452
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,993
I can go to the dance with you.

453
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,120
<i>And also...</i>

454
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,893
I wanted to thank you
for the beautiful drawing you did of me.

455
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,970
- It's hanging in my bedroom.
- Really?

456
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:30,666
Took me, like, three hours
to finish the shading on your upper lip.

457
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,265
It's probably the best drawing I've ever done.

458
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:36,039
Yeah, it's really...
nice.

459
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,741
Yeah, well, I'll probably
pick you up at 6:00 for the dance.

460
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,013
- Is that okay?
- That's fine.

461
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,519
Okay, bye.

462
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,620
Bye.

463
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:58,167
<i>- Who was that?
- Trisha.</i>

464
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:01,795
- Who's she?
- My woman I'm takin' to the dance.

465
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:05,170
- You draw her a picture?
- Heck, yes, I did!

466
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:09,041
<i>Well, what are you going to wear to the dance?</i>

467
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,307
Just, like, a silk shirt or something.

468
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,043
<i>- What are you gonna wear?
- Dad has something for me.</i>

469
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,676
But you should probably get a suit.

470
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:25,293
Pedro, how do you feel about that one?

471
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,296
It looks nice.

472
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,298
Yeah. It looks pretty sweet.

473
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,459
It looks awesome.

474
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:34,435
That suit, it's...
It's incredible.

475
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,138
I need you to give me a ride in an hour.

476
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,648
Where to?

477
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,446
The dance.

478
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,789
<i>- You takin' my client's daughter?
- Yes.</i>

479
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,880
We need to pick her up too.

480
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:33,588
Well, Uncle Rico's got a sale
to finalize in Bonita in five minutes.

481
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:36,791
Can't you take me and then
drop me off when you're done or whatever?

482
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,815
Well, I'll be back in a minute.

483
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,286
Don't disturb me while I'm in there.

484
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:02,153
Well, hurry up, 'cause I gotta get Trisha.

485
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:26,008
Hi. I got your 24-piece set right here.

486
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,355
So you guys are, like,
Pedro's cousins with all the sweet hookups?

487
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,367
<i>Simón.</i>

488
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:39,682
Is Trisha here?

489
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:43,116
Who's that in my driveway?

490
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,285
That's my ride.

491
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:53,221
Do you wanna go over by my friend Pedro
and dance really quick?

492
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,327
<i>Napoleon.</i>

493
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,954
When did you get here?

494
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,863
Just a couple minutes ago.

495
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:13,128
Have you guys seen Trisha anywhere?

496
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,397
No.

497
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,530
Oh.

498
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,609
She probably just went to the bathroom.

499
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,373
Are you guys having a killer time?

500
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,007
Yes.

501
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:43,997
If you can't find Trisha, I'll let you
dance with Deb for a few songs.

502
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:56,211
I like your sleeves.
They're real big.

503
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:59,414
Thank you.

504
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,007
I made them myself.

505
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:08,550
So you and Pedro are getting really serious now?

506
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,558
No.

507
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,560
We're just friends.

508
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:15,187
Huh.

509
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:20,367
How your glamour shots been going lately?

510
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,439
Pretty good.

511
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:30,172
I could do a personal portrait sometime...

512
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,180
if you wanted to come over.

513
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:35,712
Okay.

514
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:28,262
Do you think people will vote for me?

515
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,771
Heck, yes.
I'd vote for you.

516
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,104
Like, what are my skills?

517
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,303
Well, you have a sweet bike...

518
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:38,973
and you're really good at hookin' up with chicks.

519
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:42,483
Plus you're, like, the only guy at school
who has a mustache.

520
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,486
That's true.

521
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,989
If you need to use any of my skills,
I can do whatever you want.

522
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:50,218
Thanks.

523
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:53,558
If I win, you can be my secretary or something.

524
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:57,656
Sweet! Plus I could be your bodyguard too.

525
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:02,101
Or, like, Secret Service captain or... whatever.

526
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,173
Okay.

527
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,413
Is that yours?

528
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,814
<i>Don't touch it.
It's Uncle Rico's.</i>

529
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,978
What's it for?

530
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,654
It's a time machine, Napoleon.
He bought it online.

531
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:29,161
- Yeah, right.
- It works, Napoleon. You don't even know.

532
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,496
Have you guys tried it yet?

533
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,364
No.

534
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:57,855
- So, are you ready?
- Yeah. Hold on.

535
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,522
I forgot to put in the crystals.

536
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:06,830
<i>Okay, turn it on.</i>

537
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,029
Kill...

538
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,164
the pow...

539
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:13,708
Kill...

540
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,505
Turn it off! Turn it off!

541
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:21,244
It's a piece of crap. It doesn't work.

542
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:24,548
<i>Well, I could've told you that.</i>

543
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,061
I-I said the 12 pack, not the 24 pack.

544
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,139
You're just gonna have to mix and match.

545
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,469
Shut up. Say it so the whole world can hear.

546
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:48,066
Well, put it back.

547
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:57,284
Napoleon, you know we can't afford the fun pack.

548
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:01,084
You think money grows on trees in this family?
Take it back.

549
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,659
<i>Get some Pampers for you
and your brother while you're at it.</i>

550
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,197
<i>We can use a little of this.
I can tell you that.</i>

551
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,566
We can use those.

552
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:27,207
The defect in that one is bleach.

553
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,983
- That's correct.
- Yes!

554
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,067
This tastes like the cow got into an onion patch.

555
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:51,803
- Correct.
- Yes!

556
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:58,171
<i>They're pretty good except for one little problem.</i>

557
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:03,986
That little guy right there, he has nipple number five.

558
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,055
A good dairy cow should have, like, four.

559
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:09,091
<i>Well done.</i>

560
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,728
<i>- Vote for Summer.
- Vote for Summer.</i>

561
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,423
Vote for Summer. Thanks.

562
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,864
Yeah.
Vote for Summer.

563
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,429
Hi. Vote for Summer.

564
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,598
Hi, ladies. Vote for Summer.
You guys voting?

565
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:32,040
- Do you think it's kinda warm in here?
- No.

566
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,649
I think it's... They have the heater on or something.

567
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,882
It seems pretty good to me.

568
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:44,517
You don't feel like your head
is burning or... or anything?

569
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,061
No.

570
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:49,529
I'm gonna go home and lay down.

571
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,600
Okay. See ya.

572
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,042
<i>- Vote for Summer.
- Yeah, right.</i>

573
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,309
<i>- I'm not votin' for her.
- Then who are you gonna vote for?</i>

574
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,475
I'm votin' for Pedro Sanchez.
Who do you think?

575
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:15,549
Hey, Don, can I have one of those buttons?

576
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,193
<i>Hey. Vote for Summer.</i>

577
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,329
<i>Hi. Vote for Summer.</i>

578
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:35,841
<i>So, that guy in Florida give you your money back yet?</i>

579
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:38,937
Oh, I wrote him an e-mail,
sayin' I'm gonna contact the authorities...

580
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:42,449
if I don't get a refund in full.

581
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:46,283
<i>Don't you ever wish you could go back...</i>

582
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:49,085
with all the knowledge you have now? Tsk.

583
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,456
I guess so.

584
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:55,053
Well, I'll tell you somethin' right now.
You'd find your soul mate.

585
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:58,793
- I've already got a soul mate.
- Oh, yeah. What's her name again?

586
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:02,269
- Lafawnduh.
- Lafawnduh. Huh.

587
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,899
<i>- How's she doin'?
- Well, I think I'm gonna need some time off.</i>

588
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,910
She's flyin' out from Detroit for a few days.

589
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:13,210
Well, what about work? Well, haven't...
haven't you studied up on the new product?

590
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:17,218
- Yes.
- Well, do you know it backwards and front?

591
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,878
Basically.

592
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,885
Why don't you sell some to that girlfriend of yours?

593
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:25,460
You might as well do somethin' while you're doin' nothin'.

594
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,292
Because she doesn't need any.
That's why.

595
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:36,799
Hey. I did some drawings for the flyers.

596
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,965
Thanks.

597
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,839
Why do you got your hood on like that?

598
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:46,973
Well, when I came home from school,
my head started to get really hot.

599
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:50,780
<i>So I drank some cold water, but it didn't do nothing.</i>

600
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:54,389
<i>So I laid in the bathtub for a while...</i>

601
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:59,757
<i>but then I realized that it was my hair
that was making my head so hot.</i>

602
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:03,263
<i>So I went into my kitchen, and I shaved it all off.</i>

603
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,699
<i>I don't want anyone to see.</i>

604
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:10,297
I know what you mean.

605
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:16,108
There's just so many options.

606
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:22,708
<i>That one's good.
Looks like a medieval warrior.</i>

607
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,949
You know, you're right.
That's a good one.

608
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,397
Sorry.

609
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,703
I think this matches your season, Pedro.

610
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,204
Thank you.

611
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,935
- Vote for Pedro.
- Vote for Pedro.

612
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,273
- Vote for Pedro.
- Vote for Pedro.

613
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:24,278
- Vote for me.
- Vote for Pedro.

614
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,280
<i>- Vote for Pedro.
- Vote for me.</i>

615
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:29,840
<i>- Vote for Pedro.
- Vote for Pedro.</i>

616
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:32,921
- Vote for Pedro. Vote for Pedro.
- Vote for... Pedro.

617
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:38,694
Hey, give me 50 cents so I can buy a pop.

618
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,888
- I don't have any, Randy.
- Come on. I'll pay you back.

619
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:44,433
I don't have...
Stop.

620
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:48,493
<i>- Don't. Stop. Stop.
- I'll do this to you.</i>

621
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,799
<i>Don't. Ow.</i>

622
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:52,875
Here. Here.

623
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:09,756
- How's your neck?
- Stings.

624
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:11,850
That's too bad.

625
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:16,726
<i>Pedro offers you his protection.</i>

626
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:26,672
- Hey, let me borrow your bike.
- No.

627
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,404
- Come on. I'll give you some chips.
- No.

628
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:31,071
Like a wash, and then you blow-dry it with bleach.

629
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,142
Yeah. It's so cool.

630
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,546
Hey, you Trisha?

631
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,585
- Yeah.
- You remember me?

632
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:48,248
I'm a friend of your mom's.
I'm... I'm Napoleon's uncle. Uncle Rico.

633
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:53,350
- Oh. Yeah.
- Hey, could you do me a favor?

634
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:56,429
Could you give your mom a couple of these...

635
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:59,797
<i>and tell 'em to hand 'em out to her friends or whoever?</i>

636
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:01,767
'Kay.

637
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:06,205
You girls give me a call
if you feel like you could use some.

638
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:16,084
Have a nice day.

639
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:18,601
Why the heck you throwin' crap at my van, Napoleon?

640
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:22,508
Everybody at school thinks
I'm a freakin' idiot 'cause of you.

641
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:25,205
You're gonna clean my van... right now.

642
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,714
Get off of me, you "bodaggit."

643
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:48,565
<i>Higher. No, no, higher.</i>

644
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,162
Yeah!

645
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:56,235
<i>Yeah. Hit it.!</i>

646
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,484
Dang.

647
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:37,047
Look, Pedro. I don't know
how they do things down in Juarez...

648
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:40,384
but here in Idaho we have a little something called pride.

649
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,923
Understand?

650
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:47,860
<i>Smashing in the face of a piñata
that resembles Summer Wheatly...</i>

651
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:52,957
is a disgrace to you, me and the entire Gem State.

652
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:09,885
<i>Welcome to D-Qwon's Dance Grooves.
Are you ready to get your groove on?</i>

653
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:13,682
<i>- Yes.
- All right, then. Let's get started.</i>

654
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,533
Are you disqualified?

655
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:33,503
No. They just made me take down
the flyers as a penalty for the piñatas.

656
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,169
Can you still run for president?

657
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,213
Yes.

658
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:43,274
I don't understand.

659
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:48,789
<i>He say... you're not allowed to smash piñatas
that look like real people.</i>

660
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:52,859
But we do it in Mexico all the time.

661
01:08:55,097 --> 01:08:56,997
Your hair looked great today.

662
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,068
Thank you.

663
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:06,470
All right.
See you tomorrow, Pedro.

664
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:22,889
Who are you?

665
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:26,393
- I'm Lafawnduh.
- What are you doing here?

666
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,396
I'm waiting for Kip.

667
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:34,435
- Kip?
- Why are you so sweaty?

668
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,064
<i>- I been practicing.
- Mmm.</i>

669
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,474
- Practicing what?
- Some dance moves.

670
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:47,241
<i>You like dancing?</i>

671
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,582
<i>My chores are done.</i>

672
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,746
- So, you ready, Lafawnduh?
- I am, honey.

673
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,848
Sorry, Napoleon. We're just runnin'
a little bit late for some prime rib.

674
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,393
- Tell Uncle Rico not to wait up for me.
- Here.

675
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:02,464
<i>You might like that.
My cousin made it.</i>

676
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:05,295
<i>I'll be waitin'outside for you, baby.</i>

677
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:08,902
Bye, Napoleon.

678
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:11,268
See ya.

679
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:17,709
<i>Lafawnduh is the best thing that has ever happened to me.</i>

680
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:20,509
I'm a hundred percent positive that she's my soul mate.

681
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:24,347
Napoleon, I'm sure there's a babe out there for you too.

682
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,248
Peace out.

683
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,862
See ya.

684
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,845
<i>Is this what you were looking for?</i>

685
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:59,478
<i>Nah, I was thinkin'of somethin'
a little more... soft around the edges.</i>

686
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:02,580
Hmm. Well...

687
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:05,489
I have a nice, soft pink sheet I could hang...

688
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:10,190
and I could wrap you in some foam or...
something billowy?

689
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,793
Yeah, billowy's good.

690
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:18,939
It'd be really nice...

691
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,703
if I could get the fan going.

692
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:24,301
I could hang some tinsel from the top.

693
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:31,613
<i>You know, Deborah, you have... striking features.</i>

694
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:36,054
<i>Such a soft face should be complimented with a...</i>

695
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:38,183
soft body.

696
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:41,990
Mr. Rico?

697
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:45,692
My friends and clients, they call me "Uncle Rico."

698
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:50,972
What are you doing?

699
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:54,042
Shh. Don't say another word.

700
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:58,079
Napoleon told me you'd be interested.

701
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:06,414
Napoleon?

702
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:10,515
You stop wishin', and call me when you're ready.

703
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:44,124
- Hello?
- Napoleon?

704
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:47,024
- Yeah. Who's this?
- It's Deb...

705
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:49,791
and I'm calling to let you know
I think you're a shallow friend.

706
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:52,799
- What the heck are you even talkin' about?
- Don't lie, Napoleon.

707
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:55,267
Your Uncle Rico made it very clear how you feel about me.

708
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,565
What?

709
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:59,334
I don't need herbal enhancers to feel good about myself.

710
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:03,571
And if you're so concerned about that,
why don't you try eating some yourself?

711
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:16,213
<i>Right on.</i>

712
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:19,385
<i>Grandma just called and said you're supposed to go home.</i>

713
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:22,589
- She didn't tell me anything.
- Too bad. She says she doesn't want you here...

714
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:26,225
when she gets back because you've been ruining
everybody's lives and eatin' all our steak.

715
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:29,600
- I'm not goin' anywhere, Napoleon.
- Get off my property!

716
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:32,731
It's a free country.
I can do whatever I want.

717
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:35,969
Get off my property, or I'll call the cops on you.

718
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,239
Well, then do it.
Go on.

719
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:40,315
Maybe I will. Gosh!

720
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:58,932
- Hello?
- Pedro?

721
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:01,434
- How's it goin'?
- Good.

722
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:04,768
Deb just called me.
She pretty much hates me by now.

723
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:07,603
- Why?
- 'Cause my Uncle Rico's an idiot!

724
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,041
Do you have anything to give to her?

725
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:13,637
No, not unless she likes fish.

726
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:19,018
- Are you still gonna give your speech tomorrow?
- Yes.

727
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:22,613
- Do you already know what you're gonna say?
- Yes...

728
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,624
but not all of it.

729
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:26,694
Just tell 'em that...

730
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:32,290
their wildest dreams will come true if they vote for you.

731
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:36,303
I'll see you tomorrow, Pedro.

732
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:55,516
<i>Dang it.!</i>

733
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:57,854
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

734
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:46,006
<i>Now, if you look right here,
we have SallyJohnson from Manitou, Colorado.</i>

735
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,873
Would you like to read her testimonial right there?

736
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:51,878
<i>Sure. Um...</i>

737
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:56,474
"After using Bust Must Plus, I have such big bosoms..."

738
01:15:57,586 --> 01:16:00,316
I don't feel comfortable reading this.

739
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:03,585
Oh, that's fine.
That's fine.

740
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:06,092
But do you feel comfortable with me?

741
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:14,798
You could be...

742
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:18,464
somewhere around, uh...

743
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,599
here.

744
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:26,413
<i>Come here, boy.!</i>

745
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:44,059
Well, I never thought I would make it here today.

746
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:46,259
<i>I would be a great class president because...</i>

747
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:49,860
<i>I promise to put two new pop machines
in the cafeteria, and...</i>

748
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:53,203
<i>I'm also gonna get a glitter Bonnebell
dispenser for all the girls'bathrooms.</i>

749
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:55,936
<i>Oh, we're gonna get new cheerleading uniforms.</i>

750
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:59,172
<i>Anyway, I think I'd be a great class president, so, uh...</i>

751
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,476
<i>who wants to eat "chimini-changas" next year?</i>

752
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:07,112
Not me. See, with me, it will be summer all year long.

753
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:10,282
<i>Vote for Summer.</i>

754
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:24,331
And now Summer will perform her skit with
members of our very own Happy Hands Club.

755
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:30,539
Your speech is up next.
Your skit had better be pretty good.

756
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:34,946
- A skit?
- You perform a skit after your speech, Pedro.

757
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,780
What?
A flippin' skit?

758
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:40,047
<i>- Why didn't anybody tell us about this?</i>

759
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:44,318
<i>I don't want to be president anyway.</i>

760
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:46,944
Pedro, just listen to your heart.

761
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,580
That's what I do.

762
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:54,421
I'll just tell them that I have nothing to say.

763
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:13,347
Hello.

764
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:17,083
I don't have much to say.

765
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:21,747
<i>But I think it would be good to have
some holy santos brought to the high school...</i>

766
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:25,452
<i>to guard the hallway and to bring us good luck.</i>

767
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:30,327
<i>El Santo Niño de Atocha is a good one.
My Aunt Concha has seen him.</i>

768
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:33,366
<i>And...</i>

769
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:36,995
<i>we have a great F.F.A. Schedule lined up...</i>

770
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:40,131
And I'd like to see more of that.

771
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:48,473
If you vote for me,
all of your wildest dreams will come true.

772
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:52,279
Thank you.

773
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:15,200
<i>Up next, I hope you'll enjoy a skit by Pedro Sanchez.</i>

774
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:23,891
Oh.

775
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:43,894
I caught you a delicious bass.

776
01:25:48,443 --> 01:25:50,809
You wanna play me?

777
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:50,850
I, uh, would like to give you this advice.

778
01:29:50,952 --> 01:29:54,080
And a fella give me some years ago.

779
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:57,715
He said, "When an argument arises...

780
01:29:57,825 --> 01:30:02,353
<i>"if you go outside and take, uh, a nice walk...</i>

781
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:07,230
<i>"you'll calm down and then you can
come back and it won't be an argument.</i>

782
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:09,462
<i>"And you'll find that helps your health.</i>

783
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:13,028
All that fresh air and exercise
will do you a lot of good."

784
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:19,112
Is there anything else you'd like to ask about?

785
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:26,745
<i>Pedro.</i>

786
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:31,254
- Where the heck's Napoleon?
- I don't know.

787
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:37,127
Lafawnduh Lucas, do you take Kipland Ronald Dynamite...

788
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:40,428
<i>to be your lawful wedded husband...</i>

789
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:45,234
<i>to honor in sickness and health till death do you part?</i>

790
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:47,807
I do.

791
01:30:49,577 --> 01:30:52,876
<i>Kipland Ronald Dynamite...</i>

792
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:57,212
<i>do you take Lafawnduh Lucas
to be your lawful wedded wife...</i>

793
01:30:57,318 --> 01:31:01,584
in sickness and health till death do you part?

794
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:04,055
You know I do.

795
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:09,826
<i>By the authority vested in me,
I pronounce you man and wife.</i>

796
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:13,595
You may kiss the bride.

797
01:31:42,463 --> 01:31:45,796
- Why do you love me -

798
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:49,097
- Why do you need me -

799
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:51,763
- Always and forever -

800
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:56,003
- We met in a chat room -

801
01:31:56,110 --> 01:32:00,103
- Now our love can fully bloom -

802
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:04,116
<i>- Sure the World Wide Web is great...</i>

803
01:32:04,218 --> 01:32:07,619
But you, you make me "salvivate" -

804
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:11,021
- Yes, I love technology -

805
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:14,686
<i>- But not as much as you, you see...</i>

806
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:18,231
- But I still love technology -

807
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:21,392
- Always and forever -

808
01:32:21,502 --> 01:32:24,562
- Our love is like a flock of doves -

809
01:32:24,672 --> 01:32:28,039
- Flying up to heaven above -

810
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:31,373
<i>- Always and forever...</i>

811
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:34,380
- Always and forever -

812
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:37,474
- Yes, our love is truly great -

813
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:40,213
<i>- Always and forever...</i>

814
01:32:41,322 --> 01:32:44,849
<i>- Why do you need me...</i>

815
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:48,395
<i>... Why do you love me...</i>

816
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,941
Sorry I'm late.

817
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:39,410
I just got done taming a wild
honeymoon stallion for you guys.

818
01:33:39,513 --> 01:33:41,708
Hmm.

819
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:46,583
Hey, Deb, can you take a photo of me
on the horse real quick?

820
01:33:46,687 --> 01:33:50,123
Sure.

821
01:33:51,525 --> 01:33:54,050
Thanks.

822
01:34:09,176 --> 01:34:12,771
I hope your guys's experiences are unforgettable.

823
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,940
Hmm.

824
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:19,577
Lookee, lookee.
A little keepsake for you guys.

825
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:37,931
Lucky.
