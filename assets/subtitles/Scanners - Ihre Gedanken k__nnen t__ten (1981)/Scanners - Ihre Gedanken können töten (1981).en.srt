1
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,450
Look at that fellow over there.

2
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:45,823
I have never seen anything
so disgusting in all my life.

3
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:50,542
I'll tell you something, he's staring.
I think he's looking at us.

4
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,796
- I think we're being picked up.
- Oh, it's too awful.

5
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:58,094
Can you believe
they allow creatures like that in here?

6
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,218
Really!

7
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,809
Uh...

8
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,769
Uh-uh-uh...

9
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,026
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh...

10
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,565
Oh, help, someone, please!

11
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,149
She's going to be all right.
It's all right. Stand back.

12
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,112
Ugh!

13
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,976
Damn it!

14
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,094
You're 35 years old, Mr. Vale.

15
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:51,135
Why are you such a derelict,

16
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,433
such a piece of human junk?

17
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,645
The answer is simple.

18
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:02,352
You are a scanner, which you don't realize.

19
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,442
That has been the source of all your agony.

20
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:13,823
But I will show you now
that it can be a source of great power.

21
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,629
Let them in.

22
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,657
Hurry up!

23
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,670
Hurry up!

24
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,231
You can talk now.

25
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,446
I would like to scan all of you
in this room, one at a time.

26
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:29,417
I must remind you that the scanning
experience is usually a painful one,

27
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:34,546
sometimes resulting in nosebleeds,
earaches, stomach cramps, nausea,

28
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,920
sometimes other symptoms
of a similar nature.

29
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,967
There's a doctor present. Dr. Gatineau.

30
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:46,598
I know that you've all been prepared for this
but I thought I'd remind you just the same.

31
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,437
There is one other thing.
No one is to leave this room,

32
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,195
once the demonstration has begun.

33
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,481
At this point I'd like to call for volunteers.

34
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,702
Anyone. It doesn't matter.

35
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,369
Fine.

36
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,799
Just sit right here, please.

37
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:36,236
Now, I'd like you to think
of something specific,

38
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:40,022
that will not breach
the security of your organization,

39
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,489
and that can be disclosed to this group.

40
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:45,697
- Something personal, perhaps.
- All right.

41
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:51,204
- I have something. Shall I close my eyes?
- It doesn't matter.

42
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,583
All right, yes, I have something.

43
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,497
Get everybody out, now!
Call ConSec leader!

44
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,549
- I want you to come with me.
- I didn't do anything.

45
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,006
I said I want you to come with me!

46
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,384
Come on!

47
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,844
Gatineau, come with us!

48
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,067
Down there! Quick!

49
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,278
Move it!

50
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,323
Get down!

51
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,243
Give him a shot of Ephemerol!

52
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,370
Come on!

53
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,994
OK.

54
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:52,048
Take it easy.
All we need is to get stopped by a cop.

55
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:56,769
It would serve him right. Why the hell
do they have to send us to the old factory?

56
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:02,146
If this guy's a scanner, they don't want him
down at Central. They're afraid of him.

57
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,193
He is a scanner.

58
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,240
Hey, where's Security 2?

59
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,369
He's moving up fast on the left.

60
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,365
Hey, man, what's happening?

61
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,249
Ray! What the hell's the matter with you?

62
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,173
You gotta pull back behind him, man.
Come on!

63
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,800
Ray, I'm gonna kill you if you don't do it.

64
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,553
Ray!

65
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,733
Oh, my God!

66
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:47,648
Don't stop! Move it!

67
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,946
No, we gotta get him out of there!

68
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,626
Come on now, let's go!

69
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,002
There are people inside!

70
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,131
Get up.

71
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,892
Let's get out of here, man!
Do you want to get us killed?

72
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:22,182
All right, now! Pipe down. All right.

73
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:29,954
Last night, we at ConSec
chose to reveal to the outside world

74
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:35,554
our work with those telepathic curiosities
known as scanners.

75
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:39,557
The result, six corpses...

76
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:45,432
and a substantial loss in credibility
for our organization.

77
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:51,111
So this morning we have a new director
of internal security, Mr. Braedon Keller.

78
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,023
Thank you.

79
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,440
Mr. Trevellyan, gentlemen,

80
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,867
we're in the business
of international security.

81
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:01,908
We deal in weaponry and private armies.

82
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:06,376
We do not trade
in fantasy and pipe dreams.

83
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:11,289
Let us leave the development of dolphins
and freaks as weapons of espionage

84
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,210
to others.

85
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:17,002
With all due respect to Dr. Paul Ruth,

86
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:21,724
I recommend that we drop
our scanner programme immediately, sir.

87
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:25,101
Dr. Ruth, what's your response?

88
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:29,148
Mr. Keller, who composed
our audience last night?

89
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:34,774
We had 25 financial and political VIPs
from all over North America.

90
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,735
Were these VIPs carefully screened?

91
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:41,610
The screening process used
was very sophisticated, yes.

92
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:45,240
Yet an assassin managed
to infiltrate this group.

93
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:50,670
- Yes.
- And kill six of our people?

94
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,922
- Yes.
- How did he kill them?

95
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:59,252
We have reason to believe
he used scanning techniques.

96
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:02,099
Then do you suggest, Mr. Keller,

97
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,683
that this highly skilled assassin, very deadly,

98
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:09,721
who embarrassed us all in front of
the community we were trying to impress

99
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,486
was himself a scanner?

100
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,609
We believe so, yes.

101
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:21,992
That, gentlemen, is my response.
The weapons capability of these telepathic...

102
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,404
Curiosities?

103
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,537
...is obvious.

104
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:35,083
If I may, Doctor? Your programme is based
on a list of 236 known scanners, is it not?

105
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,215
It is.

106
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:42,926
Of that number... Of that number,
how many are now working with us?

107
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,056
As of last night, none.

108
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:50,224
Well, then, we don't even have
a programme to drop, do we?

109
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,731
It shouldn't be very painful for anyone.

110
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:58,647
ConSec Surveillance has gradually lost
contact with all the names on our list.

111
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,492
I submit that this is not an accident.

112
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:05,361
I think we've lost them to a programme
far in advance of ours.

113
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,999
- You might elaborate, Dr. Ruth.
- In my study of the situation

114
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:13,209
I've come to the conclusion

115
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:17,164
that there is a scanner underground
developed at North America.

116
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,091
It has an organization that's well motivated,
it has a leader.

117
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,880
That's ridiculous. You can't get
two of them to sit in the same room

118
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,932
without going berserk.

119
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:30,968
You're making
a very provocative allegation, Dr. Ruth.

120
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,973
Who controls this group?

121
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,186
If you study the descriptions in this report,

122
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:39,647
you'll find that you probably met him
last night.

123
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,027
His name is Darryl Revok.

124
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,159
And he was on our list.

125
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,784
This is total fiction. Mr. Trevellyan...

126
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,281
One moment, Mr. Keller.
What do you suggest?

127
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:56,000
- Eliminate the competition.
- How?

128
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:01,249
Contact a scanner who is as yet
unknown to the underground,

129
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:07,264
convert him to our cause, and then send
him out to infiltrate the underground.

130
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,343
Convert him, Doctor? How?

131
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:13,600
They're all pathetic social misfits.
Unstable, unreliable.

132
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,640
That is because their unique gifts
are not understood, Mr. Keller.

133
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:20,903
There's one point about which
there's no doubt at all,

134
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,527
and that is that ConSec was attacked.

135
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:28,454
For our own peace of mind,
we have to retaliate in some way.

136
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:33,117
And I think Dr. Ruth's suggestion
is a very interesting one.

137
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:39,924
Except that... we don't have
any scanners left to send into the field.

138
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,584
As a matter of fact...

139
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:48,304
I do have one still unaffiliated.

140
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,804
A very special one.

141
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,781
I don't suppose you speak much.

142
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,034
No.

143
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:12,161
It's not surprising.

144
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:16,662
With all those other voices in your head,
how can you hear your own voice?

145
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:19,920
How can you develop a self, a personality?

146
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,381
How do you feel?

147
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,675
I feel... crystal clear.

148
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:33,934
How do you like it? Clarity.

149
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,478
I'm not sure.

150
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,899
I think I'm a bit afraid.

151
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,109
Why?

152
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,112
I feel so exposed.

153
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,408
I can hear myself.

154
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,069
- You hear your own voice?
- Yes.

155
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:55,834
- Good.
- You called me a scanner.

156
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,542
What is that?

157
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:06,423
A freak of nature,
born with a certain form of ESP.

158
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:12,975
A derangement of the synapses,
which we call telepathy.

159
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,769
It could be a disease, possibly.

160
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:21,391
Or a result of radiation.
We don't really know why.

161
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,111
Who are you?

162
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,865
My name is Dr. Paul Ruth.

163
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,404
I'm a psycho-pharmacist by trade,

164
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:37,197
specializing
in the phenomenon of scanners.

165
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:44,757
The woman in the shopping mall,
what were you doing to her?

166
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:48,132
I wasn't doing anything to her.

167
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,378
It was her.

168
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:54,968
She was... forcing me...

169
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,725
'To what?'

170
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:00,728
'To think about her.'

171
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:05,687
'The 50 people that were here
appeared to disturb you.

172
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:09,065
- 'Why was that?'
- 'They talked too loud.

173
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,993
- 'They talked, and they talked...'
- 'Really?

174
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:14,402
'I didn't see their lips move, did you?'

175
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:20,416
'No, it was the other voices, the ones
without lips. They were drowning me.'

176
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,791
I couldn't stop them.

177
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,795
The injection I gave you, with the needle,

178
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:31,633
- what happened to the voices?
- They stopped.

179
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:35,885
The drug is called Ephemerol.

180
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:38,182
It's a scanner-suppressant.

181
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,018
It does nothing
when it's given to ordinary human beings.

182
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:46,734
When given to a scanner,
it prevents the flow of telepathy.

183
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,940
It stops the voices.

184
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,816
- It can help you.
- How do you know these things?

185
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:56,532
It's my profession.

186
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,344
This is Mr. Keller.

187
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,060
Will my car be ready this evening?

188
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,028
'Tell us what you did, please, Darryl.'

189
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:37,781
- 'I drilled a hole in my head.'
- 'Where? '

190
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:41,038
'It's kind of obvious, isn't it? Right here.'

191
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:46,494
'Why did you do it, Darryl?
Why did you drill the hole?'

192
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,628
'Too much pressure.

193
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,090
'To lessen pressure.'

194
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:57,801
'You wanted to let the pressure out? You
wanted to let something out of your head?'

195
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,180
'Listen, I can't get anything past you, can I?'

196
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:05,893
'You wanted to let something
out of your head?'

197
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,059
- 'Uh-huh.'
- 'What?'

198
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,191
'People.

199
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,866
'The people in my head.
They're from the Devil.'

200
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,991
'You mean the voices?'

201
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,706
'No. All people. Arms, legs, hands.'

202
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,330
'What's that you've put over the hole?'

203
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:31,129
'It's a door. I put an eye on it so they won't
know it's a door and they can't get back in

204
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:36,008
- 'cos they'll see the eye, you know...'
- 'Do you think that will fool them? '

205
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:39,842
'Sure. Sure it will.

206
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:44,595
- 'I mean, sure it will, you know.'
- 'I mean, if that's the only way...'

207
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:46,930
'No!

208
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:50,642
'What do you know?
You don't know nothing, do you?

209
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:55,445
'You want to see if I can do it again?
Do you? You want to see how I did it?

210
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,450
'Aaaargh!'

211
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:27,397
- 'Darryl...'
- 'Get your hands off me.

212
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:31,775
'Get your hands... Get your hands off me!

213
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,900
'Get your hands off me!'

214
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:54,205
That's me, isn't it?

215
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,339
As you were...

216
00:27:57,219 --> 00:28:00,588
without Ephemerol, without guidance.

217
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,805
Is he still like that?

218
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:07,308
- Worse.
- How could he be?

219
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:10,847
At the age of 22,
he was extremely self-destructive.

220
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:15,318
Now, at the age of 35,
he is simply destructive.

221
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:19,817
In many ways, Cameron, he is your enemy.

222
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,948
And mine.

223
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,535
But I don't even know him.

224
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,991
He... knows you.

225
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:35,588
Somehow he was able to gather
a master list

226
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,212
of all the scanners who were ever born.

227
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:40,341
He has sought them out, one by one,

228
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:46,799
asked them to join him in an insane crusade
to destroy the society that created him.

229
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:50,017
And me?

230
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:53,723
He was looking for you but I found you first.
You can help me.

231
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,774
I don't understand.

232
00:28:55,861 --> 00:29:00,404
All the scanners
who didn't agree to join him were murdered.

233
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:06,908
These murders represent a loss to mankind
of the most spectacular human beings

234
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:09,702
that ever walked the face of this planet.

235
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,995
You, Cameron,
and your brothers and sisters,

236
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:18,626
can bring a glory and a brilliance to our
society that has never been seen before.

237
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,340
We must stop Revok. Now.

238
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:12,762
ConSec are not ready
to give up their programme.

239
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:18,271
Paul Ruth... came up with a secret weapon.

240
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,400
What?

241
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:23,358
Someone you've been looking for, I think.

242
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:26,782
A scanner. Calls himself Cameron Vale.

243
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:31,451
I've seen him.

244
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,245
And Ruth knew exactly where to find him.

245
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,749
He's in indoctrination right now.

246
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:43,210
Can he do anything?
What kind of shape is he in?

247
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,925
He seems to function.

248
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:49,172
But he's nothing to worry about.

249
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,305
He's weak.

250
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,392
Very weak.

251
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:00,517
Welcome to our little psychic gymnasium...

252
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,986
...Cameron Vale.

253
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,450
And please meet

254
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:13,787
yoga master Dieter Tautz.

255
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:23,705
Mr. Tautz has kindly consented
to be your psychic sparring partner.

256
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,628
He has publicly demonstrated
on many occasions.

257
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:33,808
By the power of his will,
he can control his heart rate,

258
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:36,515
his alpha-wave rhythm,

259
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:41,730
and many other supposedly uncontrollable
functions of the human body.

260
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:44,060
- Are we ready?
- Just about.

261
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:46,194
Proceed.

262
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:50,196
If you'd be kind enough
to sit facing this gentleman here.

263
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,158
I want you...

264
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:05,164
I want you to slowly release your scan.

265
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:07,750
Slowly, with focus.

266
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:12,260
I want it to touch... his heart.

267
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,805
But not his brain. You understand?

268
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:17,683
Telepathy is not mind-reading.

269
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:21,809
It is the direct linking

270
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,605
of two nervous systems

271
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:26,734
separated by space.

272
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:31,193
I want you to make a link...

273
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:37,196
from your brain... to his heart.

274
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,917
I want your brain to make his heart...

275
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,795
beat faster.

276
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:51,340
If his heart beats too quickly,

277
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:55,757
then he will take over control of his heart...

278
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,975
and slow it down.

279
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:04,639
Don't worry about him. All you have to do...

280
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:09,937
is make his heart beat faster.

281
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:12,071
Fast...

282
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,741
Fast.

283
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:16,871
Fast.

284
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,165
Fast.

285
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,462
Faster. Faster...

286
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:27,748
Faster. Faster!

287
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,751
Faster!

288
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:44,645
Aaargh!

289
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:48,183
End your scan.

290
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:50,318
End it!

291
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:55,994
- Stop him!
- End it!

292
00:33:58,038 --> 00:33:59,912
End it!

293
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,803
You were right, Dr. Ruth.

294
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,930
It was easy.

295
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:27,433
This man's name is Benjamin Pierce.

296
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:33,362
These photographs were taken in a prison
for the criminally insane.

297
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:38,157
There's another one.

298
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:41,531
This is a plaster cast of him
at present on display

299
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,865
in the Crostic Art Gallery

300
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:47,083
He's our only lead.

301
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:52,588
A known scanner who may or may not
be part of Revok's underground.

302
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:56,217
Why was he in prison?

303
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:59,219
He tried to kill his entire family.

304
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:03,390
His father, his sister,

305
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:05,471
mother.

306
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:11,934
At the age of ten. That was in 1958.
A few years later, he was released.

307
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:14,986
They say here...

308
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:18,608
"Rehabilitation through art."

309
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:53,187
The man has incredible power, doesn't he?

310
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:55,318
Power?

311
00:35:55,406 --> 00:35:57,528
Oh, yes, he does.

312
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:59,692
I'm Arno Crostic.

313
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:02,536
I'm pleased you came to my gallery.

314
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:06,491
Are you an aficionado of Benjamin Pierce?

315
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:11,325
I'm interested in buying this piece
for my apartment in Paris.

316
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:13,747
- Yes?
- I don't think it'll work out

317
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:16,166
unless I can get to meet the artist first.

318
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:20,218
I'm afraid, no.

319
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:24,517
I hope it won't prejudice you
against acquiring this piece

320
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:30,889
but I would lose Benjamin Pierce for good
if I even approached him with the idea.

321
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:34,102
You see, it's part of our agreement.

322
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,685
He will not meet his public.

323
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:40,777
Maybe you could just tell me where he lives.

324
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:45,328
Then I could approach him myself
and you wouldn't be involved.

325
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:47,453
I'm afraid I can't.

326
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:54,664
Then maybe you could just
think about where he lives.

327
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:57,630
Excuse me.

328
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:01,211
I'm suddenly... feeling ill.

329
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:16,983
Arno, what's the matter?

330
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:21,530
- Are you OK?
- I will be all right.

331
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:25,365
Let me take you back to your office.
You've got to lie down.

332
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:27,992
That's it, take my arm. I'll help you.

333
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:46,030
Benjamin Pierce?

334
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:48,157
Why don't you leave me alone?

335
00:38:57,838 --> 00:38:59,877
I need some help.

336
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:02,538
You're the only one that could give it to me.

337
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:06,301
Is that right?

338
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:08,843
- Me?
- Yes.

339
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:24,235
Then I think you're in big trouble, chum.

340
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:36,249
I've heard you know
a man named Darryl Revok.

341
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:44,881
Who are you?

342
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:07,072
I was told
you were coming to pay me a visit, Mr. Vale.

343
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:10,072
How did you know that?

344
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:12,784
How did I know that? Well...

345
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:16,579
I have friends.

346
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:21,125
I don't want them...

347
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:23,252
but I have them.

348
00:40:29,513 --> 00:40:31,552
Scanner friends?

349
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:37,892
What do you mean by that?

350
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,138
I'm one of you.

351
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:44,232
- You're one of me.
- Yes.

352
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:54,992
You know what I think?

353
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,663
I think you'd better tell me
what you really want.

354
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:12,968
It's the voices in my head.
They're driving me crazy.

355
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:17,093
How do you stop them, your voices?

356
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:24,855
My art.

357
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:29,897
My art keeps me sane.

358
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,742
My art...

359
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:38,995
Sane...

360
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:42,208
I don't have anything like this.

361
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,915
That's why I have to find Darryl Revok.

362
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,751
You,

363
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:53,754
my friend...

364
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,514
are a liar.

365
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:01,601
- Get out!
- Look...

366
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:05,638
I'm not leaving until you tell me
where I can find Darryl Revok.

367
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:09,484
No?

368
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:12,857
All right. Well, then, I'll get out.

369
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:24,284
Aaaargh!

370
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,880
Aaargh!

371
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:41,591
Ow!

372
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:43,726
No!

373
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:20,029
'The eye of Revok...
The eye of Revok...

374
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:24,697

00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,031

'Kill Obrist... Kill Obrist...'

379
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:06,326
Good evening, sir. Can I help you?

380
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:08,454
Are there any messages for me?

381
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:11,543
- Your name, sir?
- Cameron Vale.

382
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:13,787
- And your room number?
- 802.

383
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:17,921
Yes, this package is for you, sir.

384
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:17,291
My name is Cameron Vale.

385
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:20,415
- I've got to talk to Kim Obrist.
- Come on in.

386
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:37,055
Oh, God... They killed Ben Pierce.

387
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:40,565
- Yes.
- Come on upstairs.

388
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,000
Just wait here a sec.

389
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:04,458
Kim, Revok got to Ben Pierce. He's dead.

390
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:09,012
This guy's name is Cameron Vale.
I scanned him. He's for real.

391
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:11,767
He was there when it happened.

392
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:23,232
Sit down.

393
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:35,286
I know you.

394
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:37,413
You were at the gallery.

395
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,161
You were looking for Pierce.

396
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:42,293
I need help.

397
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:33,052
'Scan together. Scan together and
our minds begin to flow into each other

398
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:39,759

00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,192

404
00:50:26,777 --> 00:50:28,816
No!

405
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:30,943
Aaargh!

00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:37,445

409
00:51:43,562 --> 00:51:45,601
Around the side, quick!

00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:47,729
Hurry!

411
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:52,233
Get in!

412
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,074
Let's go!

413
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:02,913
Kim...

414
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:05,037
Kim!

415
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,165
Kim, come on! Kim!

416
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,503
Now I know...

417
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:15,082
what it feels like to die.

418
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:19,928
Everywhere you go, somebody dies.
Who are you?

419
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:21,924
Who sent you?

420
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:24,473
- I'm a scanner.
- Who sent you?

421
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:27,396
I was found by ConSec.

422
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:30,814
- ConSec?
- They wanted me to find Revok.

423
00:52:30,901 --> 00:52:32,940
I think they want to kill him.

424
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:36,235
But they never told me about you.

425
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:53,878
Tony!

426
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:57,003
Tony!

427
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:38,874
Tony...

428
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:43,006
Oh, no...

429
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:49,057
Come on, we gotta get out of here!

430
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:09,037
Come on!

431
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:17,461
Excuse me.

432
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:22,294
Excuse me, outside, ma'am.
OK, let's move out.

433
00:54:23,638 --> 00:54:25,678
Back to the street.

434
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:42,904
Let me get out!

435
00:54:44,868 --> 00:54:47,739
Let's get out of here!

436
00:55:45,596 --> 00:55:47,968
We'll be all right here for a while.

437
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:50,096
It doesn't matter.

438
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:53,224
It's finished.

439
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:56,894
And nothing can stop Revok now.

440
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:01,353
We're the dream, he's the nightmare.

441
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:12,454
There's still us. I can help you.

442
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:16,198
We can destroy Revok together.

443
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:18,333
You?

444
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,329
You're barely human.

445
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:31,220
I'm sorry.

446
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:36,770
I'm sorry, but you don't understand.
You don't know Revok,

447
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:38,895
you don't know how evil he is,

448
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:42,434
how powerful he is, you don't know anything.

449
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:46,587
What are you doing?

450
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:50,174
He must have something
that will lead us to Revok.

451
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:53,344
Us? No, not me.

452
00:57:59,855 --> 00:58:01,894
There it is.

453
00:58:04,192 --> 00:58:06,232
That's it.

454
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:09,402
That's it.

455
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:15,580
Dr. Ruth, telephone call, sir.
You can take it right here.

456
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:24,430
Yes.

457
01:01:24,518 --> 01:01:26,557
'It's Cameron Vale.'

458
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:30,269
We missed you.

459
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:32,682
I made a breakthrough to Revok.

460
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:37,403
I want to come in. I want to bring you
an informant from Revok's group.

461
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:42,398
That's excellent.
I'll arrange for you to be brought in.

462
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:46,163
Can you call me back in about ten minutes?

463
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:49,913
OK. Goodbye, Dr. Ruth.

464
01:01:56,758 --> 01:01:58,798
All set?

465
01:01:58,885 --> 01:02:00,925
Ten minutes.

466
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:27,830
We may have developed a serious problem.

467
01:02:27,914 --> 01:02:32,161
Vale's coming in. He says
he has an informant from your group.

468
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:34,292
Now, is that possible?

469
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:37,587
No, he's lying.

470
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:41,251
Then why is he coming in?

471
01:02:41,345 --> 01:02:43,384
Maybe he's homesick.

472
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:48,513
Vale must know something or his informant
does. It could be about me and you.

473
01:02:48,602 --> 01:02:51,887
Then you'd better be the one
to interrogate the informant.

474
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:55,183
Ruth will talk to Vale.
I won't be able to prevent that.

475
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:59,688
If Ruth finds out anything,
anything at all... kill him.

476
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:04,656
Really?

477
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:07,910
- I thought you didn't want...
- Kill him.

478
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:10,072
Really.

479
01:03:19,091 --> 01:03:23,503
One-six, Central,
this is ConSec two-niner. Clear to land.

480
01:03:23,595 --> 01:03:29,100
'ConSec two-niner, this is ConSec Central.
Security is in place. You are clear to land.

481
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:31,390
'Repeat, affirmative to land.'

482
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:32,953
I'm afraid I'm going to have to
give you both an injection of Ephemerol.

483
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,824
Well, Braedon, no apologies,
no vote of confidence,

484
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:39,410
and my man brought back the goods.

485
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:43,288
We save the party until
we've unwrapped the presents.

486
01:04:43,383 --> 01:04:46,966
It won't take long.
I have a way with these creatures.

487
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:49,093
I know that.

488
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:52,847
So has Trevellyan.

489
01:04:55,938 --> 01:04:58,855
That's why he's asked me
to take the informant.

490
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,099
You can do what you like with Vale.

491
01:05:01,193 --> 01:05:06,947
What if that won't work?
Police-state tactics simply won't work, sir.

492
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:12,736
Really? Why don't you send a letter
to the Board about that, Doctor?

493
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:15,367
I'm sure they'd love to hear from you.

494
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,044
Come in.

495
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:29,467
Welcome.

496
01:05:30,222 --> 01:05:32,261
Congratulations.

497
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:34,389
It's good to have you back home.

498
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:37,014
Where's the girl? She should be here.

499
01:05:37,104 --> 01:05:40,389
She's in another room, being interrogated.

500
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:42,521
I thought it would be you.

501
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:47,647
So did I. That's why I made sure the needles
I gave you both were harmless.

502
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:51,274
She'll be able
to protect herself if there's any problem.

503
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:53,195
Why did you do that?

504
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:56,952
Gesture of trust, dear friend.

505
01:05:58,583 --> 01:06:01,122
I have my own methods.

506
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:03,251
And I've nothing to hide.

507
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:05,378
Nothing at all to hide.

508
01:06:07,259 --> 01:06:09,465
Not even the RIPE programme?

509
01:06:09,553 --> 01:06:11,592
The what?

510
01:06:13,682 --> 01:06:17,383
Do you know of a drug laboratory
called Biocarbon Amalgamate?

511
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:22,145
Yes, of course. I founded it in 1942.

512
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:27,862
- You?
- I sold it to ConSec. That's why I'm here.

513
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:34,281
Let's say that
we have a... genial working relationship.

514
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:38,286
Do you know what that lab does?

515
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:42,038
It's been so long
since I've been in touch with them...

516
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:47,038
As far as I know,
they make some sort of chemical weaponry,

517
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:49,089
among other things.

518
01:06:49,176 --> 01:06:52,592
It manufactures Ephemerol for Darryl Revok.

519
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:55,384
It may even be run by Darryl Revok.

520
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,473
That's impossible.

521
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,597
No. I was there.

522
01:07:02,689 --> 01:07:05,227
I took the place of one of Revok's men.

523
01:07:06,068 --> 01:07:08,191
I saw Revok in the control room.

524
01:07:09,947 --> 01:07:12,864
The production of Ephemerol
is computerized.

525
01:07:14,326 --> 01:07:18,406
It's being manufactured
and sent out in huge tankers.

526
01:07:19,498 --> 01:07:21,656
Ephemerol is being sent out?

527
01:07:28,256 --> 01:07:30,545
Sent out where?

528
01:07:30,634 --> 01:07:33,255
The answer is in your own computer.

529
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:37,674
The programme that controls everything
is called RIPE.

530
01:07:37,766 --> 01:07:39,806
And it's a ConSec programme.

531
01:07:42,729 --> 01:07:48,269
That means that someone,
here at ConSec, is a traitor.

532
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:52,482
That someone is working with Revok.

533
01:07:56,118 --> 01:08:03,532
I want you to access the RIPE programme.
I do not have ConSec computer clearance.

534
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:05,748
Neither do I.

535
01:08:05,836 --> 01:08:07,912
You do have a nervous system.

536
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:10,542
So does a computer.

537
01:08:12,968 --> 01:08:17,760
And you can scan the computer
as you would...

538
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:20,430
another human being.

539
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:25,435
Come.

540
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:47,663
- Hello.
- Hello.

541
01:08:51,089 --> 01:08:53,129
What a pleasant surprise.

542
01:08:55,636 --> 01:08:57,675
You're very attractive.

543
01:08:59,806 --> 01:09:02,178
OK, let's do it the formal way.

544
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:05,141
Your name.

545
01:09:05,229 --> 01:09:07,268
Kim Obrist.

546
01:09:08,565 --> 01:09:10,604
Your name?

547
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,900
Not relevant.

548
01:09:18,867 --> 01:09:24,656
Now... Tell me everything you know
about Darryl Revok's organization.

549
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:27,286
Before I tell you anything...

550
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:30,496
I want to know
how you're going to protect me.

551
01:09:30,587 --> 01:09:33,921
When Revok finds out that I've come here...

552
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,798
he'll try and kill me.

553
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:41,803
Miss Obrist,

554
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:44,381
your best protection...

555
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:48,807
is to tell us everything we need to know.

556
01:09:48,897 --> 01:09:50,641
As soon as you do,

557
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:54,102
Revok will cease to be a threat to anyone.

558
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:00,029
Not good enough.

559
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:03,407
Revok's people are everywhere...

560
01:10:04,788 --> 01:10:06,828
and that scares me.

561
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:10,533
To be honest with you, Kim...

562
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:14,161
the only one you should be afraid of...

563
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:15,666
is me.

564
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,839
Why should I be afraid of you?

565
01:10:19,845 --> 01:10:22,003
I came here of my own free will.

566
01:10:29,813 --> 01:10:31,853
Because...

567
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:36,725
I know you're not what you say you are.

568
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:42,405
I want to see someone else.

569
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:47,827
Listen to me! Listen to me!

570
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:55,502
Now, I have acquaintances
in Revok's group. They tell me...

571
01:10:55,589 --> 01:10:59,290
They tell me
that you have never been one of them.

572
01:10:59,384 --> 01:11:02,171
Why are you here?

573
01:11:08,519 --> 01:11:10,558
Why?

574
01:11:21,365 --> 01:11:23,737
Goodbye, Kim.

575
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:04,980
It must be Kim. Where is she?

576
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:08,782
- Where is she?
- This is more important!

577
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:10,910
No!

578
01:12:14,417 --> 01:12:18,747
'No, this is more important.

579
01:12:18,839 --> 01:12:21,709
'The computer is more important.

580
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,840
'Access the RIPE programme.

581
01:12:23,927 --> 01:12:25,967
'More important...

582
01:12:28,223 --> 01:12:31,224
'But the RIPE programme is the past.

583
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:36,470
'Therefore to access the RIPE programme
is to access the past, no?

584
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:40,105
'Access the past...

585
01:12:40,777 --> 01:12:43,731
'Access the past...'

586
01:12:47,284 --> 01:12:49,323
Security!

587
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:58,492
The scanners. Find them and kill them.
Put it on the air!

588
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:01,541
Find them and kill them.

589
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:12,299
It mustn't happen again.

590
01:13:13,226 --> 01:13:15,848
It's always been there inside me,

591
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:20,895
lurking away, sucking out my joy
and rotting my successes.

592
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:26,063
Cameron...

593
01:13:26,156 --> 01:13:28,196
Poor Cameron.

594
01:13:28,283 --> 01:13:30,525
I have a way with you, Cameron.

595
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:36,412
It mustn't happen again.

596
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:41,209
RIPE. Ripe, indeed.

597
01:13:44,925 --> 01:13:47,629
The RIPE programme... must be stopped!

598
01:13:54,143 --> 01:13:58,639
This isn't the same thing, you understand.
Not the same thing at all.

599
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,770
It's different.

600
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:03,564
The first time was an accident.

601
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:06,437
Fortunate for some.

602
01:14:07,572 --> 01:14:09,612
Unfortunate for others.

603
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:17,073
The RIPE programme is cold and cruel.

604
01:14:21,378 --> 01:14:23,417
Very...

605
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,129
Very cold...

606
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,219
Very cruel...

607
01:15:18,102 --> 01:15:21,138
- What happened?
- Keller tried to kill me.

608
01:15:21,229 --> 01:15:23,934
Keller? Then he's the one.

609
01:15:38,288 --> 01:15:40,328
Oh, my God...

610
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:52,382
Mom, what are you doing here?

611
01:15:55,556 --> 01:15:57,679
I'm sorry, Mom.

612
01:15:59,476 --> 01:16:00,887
Mom...

613
01:16:00,978 --> 01:16:03,017
I didn't...

614
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:05,144
I didn't mean...

615
01:16:09,611 --> 01:16:11,022
Mom...

616
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:16,942
I didn't mean it, Mom. Please...

617
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:21,039
There's blood on my hand.

618
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:23,364
Secure the computer room!

619
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:25,498
Blood on my hand...

620
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:28,709
What's going on?

621
01:16:30,006 --> 01:16:32,046
What the hell is going on?

622
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:35,506
It's the scanners, sir. They're out.

623
01:17:00,412 --> 01:17:02,535
Is this the only way we can do it?

624
01:17:02,622 --> 01:17:06,870
If we don't plug into the computer now,
they're going to reprogramme it.

625
01:17:26,897 --> 01:17:28,937
What does that mean?

626
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:31,941
It means
someone has reprogrammed the computer

627
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:34,981
so that the RIPE programme
is locked away inside.

628
01:17:35,072 --> 01:17:37,693
He threw away the key
and plugged the keyhole.

629
01:17:39,618 --> 01:17:41,860
Try it again. Try it again.

630
01:17:41,954 --> 01:17:43,993
OK.

631
01:17:59,179 --> 01:18:02,050
That's as deep into it as we're going to get.

632
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:05,675
Hey, Lee, punch up your internal monitor.

633
01:18:05,769 --> 01:18:08,853
- Access is IM 863.
- Why, what is it?

634
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:13,233
Someone's inside this thing right now,
getting the RIPE programme.

635
01:18:25,915 --> 01:18:29,829
How can this happen?
This room is max security.

636
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:32,955
We're plugged into the telephone system.

637
01:18:33,838 --> 01:18:38,050
Anybody who has the proper access codes
could get in here long-distance.

638
01:18:40,304 --> 01:18:43,719
- Someone's getting in there right now?
- Yeah.

639
01:18:43,807 --> 01:18:45,847
Damn!

640
01:19:25,057 --> 01:19:27,096
It's him.

641
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:30,135
It's Vale. He's inside.

642
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:32,684
- Is that possible?
- It's got to be.

643
01:19:34,191 --> 01:19:36,230
It's got to be. I want to hurt him.

644
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:40,612
- How can we hurt him before he gets out?
- Hurt him? I don't understand.

645
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:45,193
Vale's nervous system and the computer's
nervous system are joined.

646
01:19:45,285 --> 01:19:47,159
He's scanning it.

647
01:19:47,246 --> 01:19:49,285
I want to cripple them both.

648
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:51,449
Or maybe kill them both. How?

649
01:19:52,959 --> 01:19:55,664
Well, I don't know if it's what you want,

650
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:59,538
but I could override
the max security self-destruct.

651
01:19:59,633 --> 01:20:04,793
It blows all the circuits, in case data is taken
by unauthorized and unfriendly forces.

652
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:07,593
- Do it now.
- That would entail a total loss

653
01:20:07,682 --> 01:20:09,759
of all programmes in the ConSec system.

654
01:20:09,851 --> 01:20:13,018
I'd need written authorization
from ConSec Leader.

655
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:16,771
Mister, this is your authorization.

656
01:20:16,858 --> 01:20:18,898
Sit down!

657
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:27,322
Do it now or I'll kill you.

658
01:20:27,411 --> 01:20:29,699
Yes, sir, I'm doing it now.

659
01:20:58,984 --> 01:21:01,522
Sir, I have to finish it over there.

660
01:21:30,599 --> 01:21:34,217
- Sir, this is the last step. Are you sure?
- Do it!

661
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:52,073
There's no need for that. It's all very quiet.

662
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:54,285
It's just internal switching.

663
01:21:55,791 --> 01:22:00,417
Really? No one's ever switched off
a scanner before.

664
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:47,254
Oh, shit!

665
01:22:49,886 --> 01:22:52,460
See? I told you,

666
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:54,595
no fireworks.

667
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:04,185
- I'll go find the doctor.
- All right, I'll keep an eye on the door.

668
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:19,984
Excuse me.
Is the receptionist coming back soon?

669
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:22,367
- Erm, yeah, I guess so.
- Thanks.

670
01:26:04,998 --> 01:26:09,079
- Please. I'll be with you in a moment.
- I have to talk to you right now.

671
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:12,123
Would you please get out of here?

672
01:26:13,381 --> 01:26:15,670
It's about this drug, Dr. Frane.

673
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:21,551
I understand
you've been prescribing it to some patients.

674
01:26:23,976 --> 01:26:26,680
Excuse me. I'll be back in just a moment.

675
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:30,768
Just relax. Read a magazine.

676
01:26:39,158 --> 01:26:43,107
Where did you get this?
What do you want with me? Who are you?

677
01:26:47,791 --> 01:26:49,665
What happened?

678
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:51,791
I was scanned.

679
01:26:54,256 --> 01:26:57,506
The woman in the... in the waiting room...

680
01:26:57,592 --> 01:26:59,964
She scanned you?

681
01:27:00,054 --> 01:27:02,093
No, not her.

682
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:05,930
Her child.

683
01:27:07,894 --> 01:27:10,053
Her unborn child scanned me.

684
01:27:12,274 --> 01:27:14,646
That's what the RIPE programme is.

685
01:27:14,734 --> 01:27:19,812
The doctors on the computer list are giving
Ephemerol to their pregnant patients.

686
01:27:20,657 --> 01:27:23,113
- I don't understand!
- Ephemerol!

687
01:27:24,244 --> 01:27:26,949
Ephemerol is creating new scanners!

688
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:32,335
- Hold still!
- Ow! God...

689
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:35,705
- Hold still!
- Oh, God... Ow!

690
01:27:35,797 --> 01:27:37,837
OK. OK.

691
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:40,878
- Oh, God...
- Come on, let's get out of here!

692
01:27:43,889 --> 01:27:45,928
Come on.

693
01:27:47,768 --> 01:27:50,223
Come on, you can make it! Come on!

694
01:27:52,689 --> 01:27:54,729
Kim... Kim...

695
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:56,856
Vale.

696
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:24,050
Kim...

697
01:28:24,596 --> 01:28:26,636
Sleeping beauty awakes.

698
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,842
Where is Kim?

699
01:28:30,936 --> 01:28:32,975
The next room.

700
01:28:33,063 --> 01:28:35,103
She'll be awake in a few hours.

701
01:28:36,817 --> 01:28:39,272
We don't want anyone in here with us.

702
01:28:40,695 --> 01:28:43,269
This is just between you and me.

703
01:28:43,365 --> 01:28:46,781
Where's your partner, Keller?
He should be here.

704
01:28:46,869 --> 01:28:51,198
Keller? It seems he died
when you blew up his computer.

705
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:55,329
By the way, that was very impressive.

706
01:28:56,086 --> 01:29:00,333
Keller murdered Dr. Ruth.
He deserved to die.

707
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:05,589
You shouldn't mourn the doctor's death.
Celebrate it with me.

708
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:12,428
Dr. Ruth was a great man.
He tried to help us. He helped me.

709
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:18,023
Great man! There's only one person on
earth who tried to help you, and that's me!

710
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:21,274
You?! You sent your soldiers out to kill me.

711
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:25,987
Never. Never you.
I've spent years looking for you.

712
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:31,116
Then when Keller told me Ruth had dressed
you up and sent you out as an amateur spy,

713
01:29:31,205 --> 01:29:36,412
I tried to take care of you,
look after you, guide you to me.

714
01:29:39,129 --> 01:29:42,083
Now, why would you try to do that?

715
01:29:42,174 --> 01:29:44,462
Who's your mother?

716
01:29:47,512 --> 01:29:49,552
I don't know.

717
01:29:52,434 --> 01:29:55,554
- Who's your father?
- I don't know.

718
01:29:55,645 --> 01:29:58,267
What was your first childhood memory?

719
01:29:58,357 --> 01:30:00,396
I don't have any.

720
01:30:00,483 --> 01:30:03,687
No, you don't.
And it's no accident that you don't.

721
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:05,818
You were kept on ice.

722
01:30:05,906 --> 01:30:10,318
It wasn't till ConSec had trouble putting
me away that they thawed you out.

723
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:13,993
You've been monitored all your life,
allowed to live like garbage.

724
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:18,208
Scum. He knew where you were
but it wasn't till he needed you

725
01:30:18,293 --> 01:30:22,754
- that he hauled you out of the slime.
- Who?

726
01:30:24,257 --> 01:30:26,297
Your father.

727
01:30:26,385 --> 01:30:28,507
Dr. Paul Ruth.

728
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:35,223
Our father.

729
01:30:38,355 --> 01:30:40,395
No...

730
01:30:41,983 --> 01:30:44,023
You're my brother, Cameron.

731
01:30:44,111 --> 01:30:46,103
My kid brother.

732
01:30:46,196 --> 01:30:48,770
No...

733
01:30:56,207 --> 01:30:59,077
Sit down. I want to show you something.

734
01:31:08,343 --> 01:31:12,127
This was a test campaign
used in 1947 to market a new product.

735
01:31:12,222 --> 01:31:14,262
The product was a drug,

736
01:31:14,349 --> 01:31:17,054
a tranquilizer called Ephemerol.

737
01:31:17,144 --> 01:31:20,145
It was aimed at pregnant women.
If it had worked,

738
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:22,935
it would have been marketed
all over North America.

739
01:31:23,024 --> 01:31:26,025
But the campaign failed and the drug failed.

740
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:31,152
It had a side effect on the unborn children.
An invisible side effect.

741
01:31:32,618 --> 01:31:35,951
- It created scanners.
- Yes.

742
01:31:36,038 --> 01:31:41,281
The man who invented Ephemerol was very
excited by this weird mutation it caused,

743
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:45,753
and so was ConSec.
They offered to finance his experiments,

744
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:48,544
so he sold them his company and himself.

745
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:53,008
And that man was Dr. Ruth?

746
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:55,136
That was Daddy.

747
01:31:56,684 --> 01:32:02,104
I said the side effects of Ephemerol were
invisible but that's not completely true.

748
01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:04,976
Daddy could see them.
He could see them in us.

749
01:32:05,066 --> 01:32:10,191
He had given the prototype of Ephemerol
to his pregnant wife, our mother,

750
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:13,898
four years before it hit the market,
and then again a year later.

751
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:16,400
His children turned out to be difficult,

752
01:32:16,495 --> 01:32:22,498
till he realized that the only thing that would
calm them down was his drug, Ephemerol.

753
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:26,503
That's why we're older than all the others.

754
01:32:27,756 --> 01:32:30,081
Not only older, more powerful.

755
01:32:31,134 --> 01:32:34,585
The rest of them,
they're nothing compared to us.

756
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:36,921
Then what did you need Keller for?

757
01:32:37,015 --> 01:32:40,182
ConSec had hardware, it had contacts.

758
01:32:41,061 --> 01:32:43,100
Keller could see the future.

759
01:32:43,188 --> 01:32:45,228
The future?!

760
01:32:45,315 --> 01:32:47,438
You murdered the future!

761
01:32:49,736 --> 01:32:53,070
That's negative, Cam. Defeatist.

762
01:32:53,156 --> 01:32:56,110
It disappoints me to hear you talk that way.

763
01:32:56,201 --> 01:32:58,906
You're starting to sound like them.

764
01:32:58,996 --> 01:33:04,868
A generation of scanner soldiers is a few
months from being born. We'll find them,

765
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,833
train them to be like us,

766
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:09,874
not like Obrist and her band of cripples,

767
01:33:09,965 --> 01:33:12,752
bring the world of normals to their knees.

768
01:33:12,842 --> 01:33:18,548
Build an empire so brilliant, so glorious,
we'll be the envy of the whole planet.

769
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,345
You sound just like him.

770
01:33:21,935 --> 01:33:23,975
Like Ruth.

771
01:33:24,062 --> 01:33:26,814
No, not like him. Like...

772
01:33:26,899 --> 01:33:29,389
Revok! Darryl Revok!

773
01:33:29,484 --> 01:33:32,687
No... Like him.

774
01:33:33,989 --> 01:33:36,741
It's as though he's been reincarnated in you.

775
01:33:39,912 --> 01:33:41,951
You're not listening to me.

776
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:47,201
You're not cooperating, Cam.

777
01:33:47,293 --> 01:33:49,701
You're not cooperating with me at all.

778
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,555
I've been counting on you
for years, Cameron.

779
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:04,800
Tell me you're not going to betray me
like all the rest. Tell me you're not.

780
01:34:04,895 --> 01:34:06,935
No!

781
01:34:16,407 --> 01:34:21,115
All right, we're going to do it the scanner
way. I'm going to suck your brain dry.

782
01:34:21,203 --> 01:34:24,287
Everything you are is going to become me.

783
01:34:24,373 --> 01:34:26,828
You're going to be with me, no matter what!

784
01:34:26,916 --> 01:34:30,962
After all, brothers should be close,
don't you think? Hm?

785
01:38:45,342 --> 01:38:47,382
Cameron?

786
01:38:47,469 --> 01:38:49,509
Kim.

787
01:38:55,644 --> 01:38:58,847
It's me, Kim. Cameron. I'm here.

788
01:39:00,983 --> 01:39:03,022
We've won.

789
01:39:05,696 --> 01:39:07,735
We've won...
