1
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:45,452
Brain is the most important
organ of the human body.

2
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:49,557
The most vital component
in the human system.

3
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:53,460
It's the brain that controls
every body part.

4
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,366
Brain is the king of all
human body parts.

5
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:18,494
Patient Name: Sanjay Singhania

6
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:20,492
Symptom: Anti retrograde
Amnesia Short term memory loss

7
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:22,824
Hey, look at this one.

8
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:26,997
This one's my project.

9
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:28,837
No.

10
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:29,937
Sir, but why?

11
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,004
Forget this case.

12
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,334
But it's such an interesting case.

13
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,440
Interesting yes,
but it's also a police case.

14
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:37,112
But...

15
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,271
Sunita, you want me to
call your parents?

16
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:41,851
Fine, I won't take it up.

17
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:46,181
But as medical students,
we want to know.

18
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:47,022
Okay...

19
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:53,518
That is Sanjay Singhania.

20
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:56,862
Hit on the head with an iron rod.

21
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,028
After the incident,
he lost his memory.

22
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:05,764
He is unable to remember anything now.
We call it short term memory loss.

23
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:10,543
He remembers events for
only about 15 minutes.

24
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:11,372
Afterwards...

25
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:13,039
he forgets everything.

26
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:16,381
For example, he'd ask your name...

27
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,551
and in 15 minutes he will
have forgotten it.

28
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:25,386
He recalls only fragments of the incident.
But we can't say how much of it he remembers.

29
00:05:27,697 --> 00:05:35,468
Regular tasks like eating,
drinking, driving, also his feelings...

30
00:05:35,672 --> 00:05:39,733
lie embedded in his
sub-conscious mind.

31
00:05:39,943 --> 00:05:43,242
How does he go about
his everyday routine?

32
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:46,744
How does a child perform
instructed tasks?

33
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:51,083
By committing to memory,
learning by rote.

34
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:52,686
Or, by jotting things
down in writing.

35
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:56,423
Likewise, he remembers
tasks by writing.

36
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,585
What was that incident?
Who assaulted him?

37
00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:07,601
This, no one knows.

38
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:10,771
Unfortunately, he doesn't
even recall a face.

39
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:19,613
How can someone live on like this...
I wonder, what he's doing this moment...

40
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:06,611
Ghajini

41
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:33,154
Killed, just like Mangesh.

42
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,095
The second, this week.

43
00:11:59,222 --> 00:12:05,559
Even if I've to search every street,
I'm going to get this one in 48 hours.

44
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:07,958
Find out who...

45
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:12,301
I must find him before the
police gets to him.

46
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:16,229
Where to?

47
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:22,300
There...

48
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:25,811
Orchard Avenue.
Pin 400076. My street

49
00:12:27,884 --> 00:12:29,408
We're in Orchard Avenue.

50
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:31,813
Take the next right.

51
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:40,494
Odyssey. It's a building on
your right. I want to go there.

52
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:45,834
My building

53
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:52,671
73 Rupees.

54
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:54,601
Whose address is it?

55
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:56,236
Mine.

56
00:13:41,257 --> 00:13:41,723
Kill him Find Ghajini

57
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:44,893
Find him Kill him

Who is Ghajini?

67
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:48,410
Revenge

00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:44,158
Kill him

71
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:14,382
Day before yesterday. 10 am.
From Hiranandani to Andheri Station.

72
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,558
Yes, I sold that ticket.

73
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:19,392
What's written behind it?

74
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:23,496
He paid me with a five hundred note.

75
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:26,628
I didn't have change.
So I wrote it on the back.

76
00:19:27,436 --> 00:19:32,897
He forgot to take the change...
hey, it must be him.

77
00:19:33,342 --> 00:19:33,808
Who...?

78
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:36,409
This one always forgets.

79
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:40,412
Sometimes he forgets to buy a ticket,
sometimes it's the change.

80
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:43,647
At times, he'll go on buying tickets.

81
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:45,820
He keeps on asking the
names of bus stops.

82
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:49,980
Can you recognise him?
- Why not... looks a strange sort,

83
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:54,084
keeps his head shaven,
has a long scar on the head.

84
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:58,092
Every morning at ten, he takes
the bus from Hiranandani.

85
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:00,598
It's nine.

86
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:03,095
We got an hour to get him. Come on.

87
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:31,957
Take camera

88
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:33,794

There he goes.

90
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:11,837
Hey...

91
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:43,871
Damn it.

92
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:50,168
See you in the canteen after the lecture.

93
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:07,888
Excuse me... excuse me, sir...

94
00:22:08,263 --> 00:22:09,321
Hi sir! I'm Sunita.

95
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:13,894
Sunita. Final year medical student.

96
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:17,234
You don't know me.
But I know you.

97
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,243
Can I talk to you for
two minutes... please?

98
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:30,083
As a medical student,
I want to know how...

99
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:34,013
Camera beeps

100
00:22:34,256 --> 00:22:35,086
What's that?

101
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:37,821
My camera.

102
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:39,316
Why is it beeping?

103
00:22:41,163 --> 00:22:42,596
It buzzes every 15 minutes.

104
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:47,259
So that I can take photos...
of important things, people...

105
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:49,927
to inscribe on them, to remember.

106
00:22:50,806 --> 00:22:51,500
On photos?

107
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:53,107
Yes.

108
00:22:57,646 --> 00:22:58,374
What are you doing?

109
00:22:58,814 --> 00:22:59,940
Making notes...

110
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,608
Tear it out, throw it away. Do it.

111
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:10,889
Can I see a photo?

112
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:32,404
My watchman

113
00:23:33,182 --> 00:23:34,308
My doctor

114
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:35,540
My manager

115
00:23:36,185 --> 00:23:37,083
My building

116
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:40,052
Hiranandani? Do you live there?

117
00:23:41,356 --> 00:23:41,822
Yes.

118
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:47,651
Can I ask...
how you got injured in the head.

119
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,727
My professor told me
about some accident.

120
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:54,826
Do you remember anything
about the incident?

121
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:56,504
Yes

122
00:23:56,705 --> 00:24:00,004
What happened?
Who hit you?

123
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:03,109
We aren't friends enough for me
to confide in you.

124
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:04,904
Sorry sir... sorry.

125
00:24:06,448 --> 00:24:07,915
I'd like to meet you again.

126
00:24:09,017 --> 00:24:10,348
Take my photograph...

127
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,410
I'll use it to remind you
when we meet again.

128
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:26,295
One more...
one for you and one for me.

129
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:33,707
I hope I'm a friend now?
Please write on it "My Friend".

130
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:45,381
Thanks.

131
00:24:45,587 --> 00:24:48,215
The next time we meet,
I'll show this to you.

132
00:26:02,664 --> 00:26:07,795
You think the police is incompetent?

133
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:41,719
My name is Sanjay.

134
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:44,323
Sanjay Singhania.

135
00:27:54,443 --> 00:27:57,071
Business is my passion,
it's also my job.

136
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,580
My dad dreamt of turning the enterprise
into India's largest cellphone company.

137
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:05,912
His dream is now my purpose.

138
00:28:07,122 --> 00:28:09,420
And I'll leave nothing undone
in order to achieve it.

139
00:28:24,873 --> 00:28:27,774
I live in Mumbai.
My mother was born in this city.

140
00:28:28,577 --> 00:28:30,044
I share a bond with this city.

141
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,617
Here we are, in Air Voice.

142
00:28:38,253 --> 00:28:39,117
In my office.

143
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:41,782
And they are my most trusted employees.

144
00:28:49,164 --> 00:28:51,962
Dad said, put all your emotions into work,

145
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:53,795
don't get emotional about it.

146
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:56,798
Across India,

147
00:28:57,005 --> 00:29:00,304
we're targeting a 500 million
subscriber base.

148
00:29:00,976 --> 00:29:01,874
Are you shocked?

149
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:03,811
I can achieve it.

150
00:29:04,346 --> 00:29:06,314
And I'm not being vain,
I'm just confident.

151
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:09,643
It's a fine line between
vanity and confidence.

152
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:12,716
That I can achieve,
speaks my confidence.

153
00:29:13,522 --> 00:29:15,888
Only I can achieve,
would speak of my vanity.

154
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:19,693
We need confidence,
let's build on it.

155
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:25,197
Kindly leave vanity outside office.

156
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:27,496
Thank you.

Hey kiddo,
you better hear

161
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:05,703
Right from my heart,
here's the order

162
00:30:05,907 --> 00:30:08,205
Just live it up,

163
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,707
there are no limits,

164
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:10,707
no borders

165
00:30:11,246 --> 00:30:13,373
There's a heady cocktail,

166
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:16,050
in wines of merriness

167
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:18,548
If you got a taste for life,

168
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,880
toe the line of happiness

169
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:23,216
Listen, here's the secret

170
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:25,723
There's no life in EMls,
take a deep breath

171
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:33,400
Don't you hold back,
just give it away

172
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:35,934
Why hide in hearts,
what you can say

173
00:30:36,104 --> 00:30:38,572
Sing and smile,

174
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:41,241
it's what life teaches

175
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:43,911
Swing it, beat it,

176
00:30:44,112 --> 00:30:46,239
we aren't hostages

177
00:30:46,448 --> 00:30:48,746
Swing in the rhythm of

179

abreast all tides and ebbs

181
00:30:56,458 --> 00:31:00,258

00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:45,828
Kalpana!

184
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:50,003
The call sheet said nine o'clock.

185
00:32:50,071 --> 00:32:51,538
You're in at ten thirty!

186
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,037
Everyone's waiting.

187
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:55,038
So much traffic today...

188
00:32:55,243 --> 00:32:58,701
Don't make excuses.
Go and change.

189
00:32:58,913 --> 00:32:59,709
Okay, sir

190
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,546
Hi... am I too late?

191
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:13,716
What life... filling in for a crowd...

192
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:16,726
and she... preens like a superstar.

193
00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:28,071
Can I go for lights?
- And roll?

194
00:33:29,444 --> 00:33:30,069
Lights.

195
00:33:31,446 --> 00:33:34,074
Roll camera.
- Rolling.

196
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:35,082
Action.

197
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:37,414
Rub and scrub...

198
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:39,744
till my hands tire

199
00:33:39,954 --> 00:33:41,421
The yellow just,
will never wear

200
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:42,917
Camera pan.

201
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:45,755
Action, ma'am...?

202
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,090
That's why you must get Kite!
Then you'll discover white

203
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:52,266
Sparkling white in One Rupee.

204
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:54,094
Gleaming, glistening whites

205
00:33:58,139 --> 00:33:58,935
Kalpana!

206
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:05,271
It'll be our eighth display site
on this road.

207
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,938
Are all six hoardings available?
- Three, sir.

208
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,777
Next choice?
- Over here.

209
00:34:11,986 --> 00:34:13,613
This one...

210
00:34:13,822 --> 00:34:15,619
a hoarding on the terrace...

211
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:17,951
will be visible from the fly-over.

212
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,786
Looks okay to me.

213
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:23,452
Who lives here?
- A girl. Kalpana. We can approach her.

214
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:24,961
Do that.

215
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:29,629
Now what?
- Battery problem.

216
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:32,131
What's going on?
Now it's the battery...

217
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:39,644
Excuse me, can we talk to Kalpana-madam?
- Kalpana isn't "madam". Plain Kalpana.

218
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:44,311
And you are...?
- We're from Air Voice.

219
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:48,319
I'm Mr Sanjay Singhania's
executive assistant.

220
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:49,649
Air Voice?

221
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:53,987
Myself, Satveer Kohli.
I run this ad film company.

222
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:58,996
We've done a range of ads...
soaps, oils, toothbrushes, digestive pills.

223
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,661
Our latest was Monkey Brand toothpowder.
You want an ad film?

224
00:35:04,873 --> 00:35:11,506
We just want to see Kalpana madam.
Mr Singhania has sent me here.

225
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:15,510
Kalpana... is in the green room.
Go ahead.

226
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:18,177
Excuse me, ma'am...

227
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:19,683
Yes?

228
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:24,517
I'm Shroff. From Air Voice.

229
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:40,370
Open the door, go in.

230
00:35:40,575 --> 00:35:41,872
Serve them tea and come out.

231
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:45,879
Sorry, don't try to convince me.

232
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,708
Your boss is enchanted?
But so what?

233
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,385
The proposition ought to be
acceptable to me.

234
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:54,548
It's a matter of love...
matter of love.

235
00:35:57,158 --> 00:36:00,889
Please madam, on behalf of my boss,
I request.

236
00:36:01,095 --> 00:36:02,562
Please think it over.

237
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:06,061
What's there to think over?
You have heard my decision.

238
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:07,564
Now leave, please.

239
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:12,072
They're going.

240
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:26,246
Madam, please...
- Tell your boss, Kalpana is displeased.

241
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:31,747
If you change your mind,

242
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:34,420
here's my card.

243
00:36:35,463 --> 00:36:36,930
Do call.

244
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:37,927
Okay

245
00:36:40,468 --> 00:36:42,095
Sorry... I'll get ready in two minutes.

246
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:42,928
Madam, one minute...

247
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:45,263
Madam...?

248
00:36:45,473 --> 00:36:46,440
Kalpana ji...

249
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,103
Ji...?

250
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:57,273
I apologise for intruding upon
your personal affairs.

251
00:36:57,485 --> 00:37:02,286
But all of us heard whatever
went on inside.

252
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,787
Spot boy, find a chair for madam.

253
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:10,630
Let me surmise what might've happened.

254
00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:15,959
Sanjay Singhania saw you somewhere.

255
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:17,133
And when he saw you,

256
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:22,298
it was love at first sight.
Thereby hangs a question.

257
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,311
He pins his hopes on a yes from you,
it's why he sent his men to you.

258
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:36,484
And you for one, are putting him away?
Am I correct, madam? Correct?

259
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:40,824
Yes, correct.

260
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:46,156
Why are you spurning
a fine proposition?

261
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,999
Today, it's a man who owns Air Voice.
Tomorrow, it'll be a Bill Gates.

262
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:57,507
Am I to just to capitulate?
After all, my choice matters!

263
00:37:57,712 --> 00:38:01,341
Think, what a wonderful
opportunity it is!

264
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,679
On a nod from you, our company will be
transported to such heights!

265
00:38:06,387 --> 00:38:10,847
You must've done a deed of great virtue.
Just say a prayer and take the plunge!

266
00:38:13,061 --> 00:38:16,189
Allow me... I'll call.
- Sir... oh, but no...

267
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,698
Ringing... talk.
- Talk.

268
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:25,865
Air Voice. Can I help you?

269
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:28,709
Hello...

270
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,378
This is Kalpana.

271
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:33,706
Kalpana... who...?

272
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,043
Oh, Kalpana of the terrace-hoarding?

273
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:43,047
We found out about you.
The house isn't yours.

274
00:38:43,257 --> 00:38:46,055
You haven't paid rent in two months.

275
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,388
And you're playing hard to get?
Get lost.

276
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:54,398
That office is all shook-up!

277
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:56,728
Keep talking.

278
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:02,235
Go to your boss and tell him,

279
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:04,570
Kalpana said yes.

280
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:15,248
So what if it isn't gold?
It still shines.

281
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:19,085
Nathumal Gendamal Jewellers.
42 Link Road, Malad West.

282
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:21,261
We have no branches.

283
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:25,925
Mom, in whom do we trust?

284
00:39:26,134 --> 00:39:32,437
In mother first, you must trust.
Only another thing, everyone trusts.

285
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,607
It's our soap. Hamam.

286
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,788
Sir... why must you...?

287
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:53,793
It doesn't matter, my child.

288
00:39:57,498 --> 00:40:00,467
Kalpana, I want to tell you
about something.

289
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:03,637
An ad film agent is coming here.

290
00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:05,969
He's into the big agencies.

291
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:09,135
What if he gets to know that...

292
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:14,975
Sanjay Singhania is romancing
our lead model?

293
00:40:17,185 --> 00:40:17,947
Then...?

294
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:19,983
It'll be a great boost for us.

295
00:40:20,855 --> 00:40:23,653
How long will we keep
making small films?

296
00:40:24,025 --> 00:40:26,823
Our company needs
national clients.

297
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,994
Sir, consider it done.

298
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:34,327
Kalpana is like a magic wand!
One flourish and yesterday's gone.

299
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:35,160
Don't worry.

300
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:44,842
Excuse me... I'm doing an article on
struggling models for Mayapuri.

301
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:49,014
Can I interview some models?
- In the green room.

302
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:55,014
Excuse me...?
- Oh, welcome.

303
00:40:55,723 --> 00:40:57,190
Be seated.
- Thank you.

304
00:40:57,391 --> 00:40:59,188
My director said
you'd be coming.

305
00:40:59,894 --> 00:41:00,690
Really?

306
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:03,688
Setting up these sets
takes so much time.

307
00:41:04,232 --> 00:41:07,201
And I got to get to the airport.
Sanjay is flying in.

308
00:41:07,401 --> 00:41:08,197
Sanjay who?

309
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:10,870
Sanjay Singhania.

310
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:12,696
Of Air Voice.

311
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:14,704
My lover.

312
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:17,711
Sanjay Singhania?
Your lover?

313
00:41:17,912 --> 00:41:21,040
Yes, you know... actually,

314
00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:23,547
we met at Delhi airport.

315
00:41:24,252 --> 00:41:30,054
I never knew he's Sanjay Singhania.
In the airport lobby, he kept staring at me.

316
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:38,064
On the flight, he was on the seat beside me.
Hi, I'm Sanjay Singhania... and I said hi.

317
00:41:38,266 --> 00:41:41,235
That's when I discovered who he is.

318
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:44,063
One minute...
can I write it down?

319
00:41:44,272 --> 00:41:46,570
Yes, why not?
You won't believe this...

320
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:50,069
From Delhi to Bombay,
he talked non-stop.

321
00:41:50,278 --> 00:41:54,078
Plain chatter. I could only
listen on.

322
00:41:54,282 --> 00:41:55,249
Then all of a sudden,

323
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,917
I love you.

324
00:41:57,618 --> 00:41:58,915
Will you marry me?

325
00:42:00,655 --> 00:42:05,251
I say, are you silly.
Are marriages made in thin air?

326
00:42:06,794 --> 00:42:10,924
Back in Bombay, I'm inundated
with phone calls and smses.

327
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:12,597
I never gave him much of a lift.

328
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:26,943
In the end, I took pity on him.

329
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:30,115
So I decided to say yes.

330
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:38,291
This week's breaking news,
right inside Mayapuri.

331
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:43,792
Business tycoon Sanjay Singhania in
an affair with an aspiring model.

332
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:46,626
Read about it in
Kalpana's own words.

333
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:53,467
Two packs of "MDH Masala" free
with this week's edition

334
00:42:59,180 --> 00:42:59,805
Hello...?

335
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:05,478
I don't know who she is,
I haven't even seen her face.

336
00:43:05,853 --> 00:43:06,979
Please don't disturb me.

337
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,157
Hello...?

338
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,152
It's all lies.

339
00:43:14,528 --> 00:43:16,155
How do I know why
she's saying all this?

340
00:43:17,198 --> 00:43:18,825
No, please talk to me later.

341
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,667
No more calls.

342
00:43:26,374 --> 00:43:27,500
Does it have
her photos?

343
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:30,336
Neither yours, nor hers.

344
00:43:32,813 --> 00:43:34,440
I want to meet her. Find out.

345
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:53,530
What do we do now?
- It's impossible. Do we return?

346
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:58,762
Wait, let's see how we can go inside.

347
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:13,046
Something happened...?
- The children are here to see the museum.

348
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:14,380
What are we to do?

349
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:23,893
One second.

350
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:35,742
Careful while you get
your feet into it.

351
00:45:18,652 --> 00:45:20,449
So sweet.

352
00:45:24,492 --> 00:45:26,119
Bye.
- Bye.

353
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:54,647
Sir, should I go in?

354
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:55,651
Wait here.

355
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:02,762
Excuse me, who's Kalpana?
- Up on the terrace.

356
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,761
My name's Sachin. Like, Sachin Tendulkar.
Recommend me, please.

357
00:46:07,134 --> 00:46:09,261
Congratulations for the good news.
- Thank you.

358
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:13,266
Excuse me... I'll see
what I can do.

359
00:46:14,141 --> 00:46:16,200
Hello... thanks.

360
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,139
Did you send the photographs?

361
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:19,141
Excuse me.

362
00:46:23,651 --> 00:46:24,618
One second.

363
00:46:25,252 --> 00:46:26,617
Yes... I'll talk to you later.

364
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:28,950
Yes?

365
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:32,317
Kalpana...?

366
00:46:32,526 --> 00:46:33,823
Yes, I am... go on.

367
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:42,164
I... read the news in Mayapuri.

368
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:50,140
Not Mayapuri again... what a day of calls,
autographs, photographs, bouquets, smses.

369
00:46:50,344 --> 00:46:54,781
I didn't tell my story for all this...
Sanjay must be so annoyed.

370
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:55,979
Sanjay...?

371
00:46:56,183 --> 00:46:57,673
Sanjay Singhania.

372
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,287
Actually,

373
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:02,648
we met at Delhi airport.

374
00:47:02,856 --> 00:47:05,586
I never knew he's Sanjay Singhania.

375
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:09,959
In the airport lobby,
he kept staring at me.

376
00:47:11,265 --> 00:47:13,995
On the flight,
he was on the seat beside me.

377
00:47:15,035 --> 00:47:18,801
Hi, I'm Sanjay Singhania...
and I said hi.

378
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:28,481
That's when I discovered who he is.
From Delhi to Bombay, he talked non-stop.

379
00:47:28,716 --> 00:47:32,652
Plain chatter.
I could only listen on.

380
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:35,319
Then all of a sudden, "I love you. "

381
00:47:36,423 --> 00:47:37,617
Will you marry me?

382
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,995
I say, are you silly.
Are marriages made in thin air?

383
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,467
I said, no.

384
00:47:48,102 --> 00:47:49,126
He said, please.

385
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,528
I said no, he kept on...
please...

386
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:53,104
I said, okay.

387
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:57,339
How can you say no to
such persistence?

388
00:47:58,746 --> 00:48:01,214
That was the long and short of it.

389
00:48:01,649 --> 00:48:04,777
This magazine had to print this
and now everyone's after me,

390
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:08,785
for recommendations,
advertisements.

391
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:19,830
Are you here for the ad shoot?

392
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:24,001
Well I...

393
00:48:24,938 --> 00:48:27,566
Everyone wears suits for the auditions.

394
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:31,069
Have you been selected for the ad?

395
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,212
Do you want me to recommend you?

396
00:48:35,783 --> 00:48:37,808
But it's the talent that you need.

397
00:48:38,452 --> 00:48:40,886
Don't set your sights
on Van Heusen Suitings.

398
00:48:41,288 --> 00:48:44,382
Do what comes your way,
papads, mosquito coils.

399
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:46,584
Catch this.

400
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:50,493
Now let's hear you say,
here's one for men.

401
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:56,327
For the bounce in the hair for alpha males...
a comb. Let's hear you say that.

402
00:49:11,652 --> 00:49:12,949
Never did it before?

403
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:17,914
Very poor...
got to put in hard work.

404
00:49:19,893 --> 00:49:23,260
Leave your number.
If anything comes up, I'll call.

405
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,203
What's your number?

406
00:49:33,707 --> 00:49:37,074
9650055555

407
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,370
Air Voice?

408
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:43,243
Same as mine.

409
00:49:43,684 --> 00:49:44,673
Crap.

410
00:49:45,686 --> 00:49:47,483
You don't find a network anywhere.

411
00:49:47,721 --> 00:49:51,316
I keep telling Sanjay, to try turning
the antenna or something.

412
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:56,686
It may be his pocket borough,
but it ought to meet some standard.

413
00:50:00,968 --> 00:50:03,493
Hi Anjali... one second...

414
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:04,898
What did you say your name was?

415
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:07,401
Sachin?

416
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:08,903
Yes.

417
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:12,470
Sachin, I'm a bit busy.
If something comes up, I'll call. Bye.

418
00:50:12,746 --> 00:50:13,610
Yes Anjali...

419
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:20,577
you know what happened?
Mayapuri just splashed my love story.

420
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:24,690
And now all day, I've been inundated
with calls, smses, oh, I'm drained.

421
00:50:24,892 --> 00:50:30,353
No! Actually,
we only met at Delhi airport.

422
00:50:30,597 --> 00:50:32,895
On the flight,
he was on the seat beside me.

423
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,661
Hi, I'm Sanjay Singhania...
and I said hi.

424
00:50:37,404 --> 00:50:41,101
From Delhi to Bombay,
he talked non-stop.

425
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:46,468
After completing law, I went to USA
and I took my MBA at Harvard.

426
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,072
I've been looking after this business
since my father passed away.

427
00:50:51,018 --> 00:50:55,614
I strongly feel that technology has to reach
people beyond social and economic barriers.

428
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:56,812
And that's the goal of our company.

429
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:02,455
I'm so sorry... cellphones,
I tell you...

430
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:04,497
Excuse me.

431
00:51:04,698 --> 00:51:05,255
Hello?

432
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:07,399
Hello, I'm Kalpana.

433
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:09,967
Kalpana... which Kalpana?

434
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:13,765
Kalpana... Sanjay Singhania's girlfriend.

435
00:51:13,974 --> 00:51:18,240
Oh I see... how have you been?

436
00:51:18,612 --> 00:51:19,306
I'm good.

437
00:51:19,513 --> 00:51:21,174
Will you do an underwear ad?

438
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:22,109
Underwear?

439
00:51:27,287 --> 00:51:29,050
Along with you?

440
00:51:29,456 --> 00:51:31,253
It's a men's only.

441
00:51:32,392 --> 00:51:34,690
Come over quickly.
Take down the address.

442
00:51:35,996 --> 00:51:37,190
One minute.

443
00:51:37,631 --> 00:51:40,998
Mark... make a note of
this address, please.

444
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:41,963
Go on.

445
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:46,602
Building 3. Chinchpokli Bunder.
Khau Galli.

446
00:51:46,807 --> 00:51:51,210
Building 3. Chinchpokli Bunder. Khau Galli.
- I beg your pardon, sir...?

447
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,371
Chinchpokli Bunder. Khau Galli.

448
00:51:55,682 --> 00:51:58,116
Chi...?
- Chinchpokli.

449
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:01,014
Chinchbokli?
- ... Pokli Bunder. Khau Galli.

450
00:52:02,556 --> 00:52:04,456
Khau... Galli.
- Galli.

451
00:52:05,859 --> 00:52:06,917
Got it.
- Thanks.

452
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,687
Arrive in an autorickshaw,
you'll make a nice impression.

453
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:14,497
D'you have the money for it?
- I'll manage.

454
00:52:14,701 --> 00:52:15,429
Fine.

455
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:17,433
I'll be waiting for you.
Bye.

456
00:52:24,011 --> 00:52:27,174
It's just too hot today...
- Are you new to Mumbai?

457
00:52:28,081 --> 00:52:31,107
Come in the rains, here rivers flow.

458
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:38,082
Moron! Can't you drive properly?

459
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:39,189
Sorry...

460
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,154
Why are you saying sorry?

461
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:44,558
Pedestrians are taking up roads,
are we meant to fly?

462
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:47,531
Drive carefully.

463
00:52:47,734 --> 00:52:48,496
Get out of my way.

464
00:52:51,705 --> 00:52:53,332
How much?
- Forty Rupees.

465
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:03,678
Boo

466
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,285
You're gawking like a country bumpkin.

467
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:12,147
The manager wants a new model.
I thought of you.

468
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:16,185
What's this ad about?

469
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:18,363
Zorro elastic underwear.

470
00:53:18,732 --> 00:53:21,724
If you make it to this ad,
you've made it.

471
00:53:21,935 --> 00:53:24,870
Just imagine yourself in
your underwear...

472
00:53:25,072 --> 00:53:27,939
at every traffic junction in town,

473
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:31,941
on sixty feet-by-forty feet banners!

474
00:53:32,913 --> 00:53:34,904
Your luck is going to change.

475
00:53:35,248 --> 00:53:37,648
Don't worry, you're getting selected.

476
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:40,550
Can't I get any other ad?

477
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:43,389
Yes... how about one
on skin allergies?

478
00:53:44,091 --> 00:53:44,750
Allergies...?

479
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:47,893
Salves, for ringworm infections.

480
00:53:48,095 --> 00:53:50,825
Then the first choice is better.
- Okay.

481
00:53:51,131 --> 00:53:53,156
Hello ma'am!
- Hi...

482
00:53:53,367 --> 00:53:56,097
You said you'd recommend me
for the underwear ad...?

483
00:53:56,303 --> 00:54:03,732
The underwear is taken, how about ringworm?
- I'll take anything, I want a break.

484
00:54:03,944 --> 00:54:05,275
That's the spirit.

485
00:54:05,512 --> 00:54:06,069
See?

486
00:54:06,279 --> 00:54:07,109
Come to the studio tomorrow morning.

487
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:09,441
Thank you, ma'am!
- You're welcome.

488
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,152
Wait a minute.

489
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:22,358
Uncle, where are you headed?
- To the bus stop ahead.

490
00:54:22,562 --> 00:54:24,052
I'll take you there.

491
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:28,496
I'll describe to you
whatever's on the way.

492
00:54:28,702 --> 00:54:29,327
Okay.

493
00:54:30,637 --> 00:54:33,606
Four schoolgirls playing tic tac toe.

494
00:54:39,513 --> 00:54:42,107
A wife thrashing her husband.

495
00:54:42,749 --> 00:54:44,444
He has lost his shirt.

496
00:54:48,822 --> 00:54:50,813
That's a radio at the tea shop.

497
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:56,794
We're crossing Sai Baba's temple.

498
00:55:01,902 --> 00:55:04,063
Now we're on the main road.

499
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,531
You've reached your bus stop.

500
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:50,049
I'm swayed

501
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,410
She flew in...

502
00:55:51,618 --> 00:55:53,245
like a swirl of wind

503
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:55,444
With that first look,

504
00:55:55,655 --> 00:55:57,714
she held my eyes

505
00:55:57,924 --> 00:55:58,891
So unlikely,

506
00:55:59,092 --> 00:56:00,719
she's so different,

507
00:56:00,927 --> 00:56:01,894
so unique,

508
00:56:02,095 --> 00:56:05,462
so unpretentious,

509
00:56:05,665 --> 00:56:07,826
and just no attitude

510
00:56:08,034 --> 00:56:12,767
So, I'm swayed

511
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:17,577
And a freshness fills my heart

512
00:56:18,145 --> 00:56:23,344
You're swayed when she flies
in on a swirl of wind

513
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:27,850
And with that first look,
oh how she holds your eyes

514
00:57:00,887 --> 00:57:03,287
The heart went aflutter,

515
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,481
dancing to a new rhythm

516
00:57:05,692 --> 00:57:07,660
My feet faltered

517
00:57:07,861 --> 00:57:10,591
I swooned in ecstasy

518
00:57:10,797 --> 00:57:13,061
I stood each day, staring her way

519
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,630
In endless wake, moments stretch

520
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:17,530
Twisting, turning, tossing, thinking

521
00:57:17,737 --> 00:57:20,570
Thinking, thinking of you

522
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,310
Her images criss-cross my mind,

523
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,488
awash in colours

524
00:57:35,689 --> 00:57:38,453
Like a gushing stream she flows,

525
00:57:38,658 --> 00:57:44,221
drenching me

526
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:49,327
Her murmurs make music

527
00:57:50,604 --> 00:57:54,267
Her trivia are priceless

528
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:57,933
Some innocence,
sweet mischief

529
00:57:58,144 --> 00:58:00,135
Somewhat gossamer,
some odd gloss

530
00:58:00,347 --> 00:58:02,838
At times bashful, then carefree

531
00:58:03,049 --> 00:58:05,882
There are seas in her, but how deep?

532
00:59:00,907 --> 00:59:05,844
Her words could make
Spring blossom

533
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:13,409
Her charm could make
seasons spring

534
00:59:15,789 --> 00:59:17,654
Even her lies...

535
00:59:17,857 --> 00:59:18,915
are so endearing,

536
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:22,492
she could make me believe
illusions in all things

537
00:59:23,496 --> 00:59:28,456
Upon her many paths,
praying, hoping, eager-eyed,

538
00:59:28,668 --> 00:59:33,367
musing fragrant shades of memories,
I stand still and...

539
00:59:33,573 --> 00:59:35,370
Time stands stilled

540
01:00:08,141 --> 01:00:18,107
BIGPictures

541
01:00:47,347 --> 01:00:49,907
Good morning, sir!
- Good morning.

542
01:00:50,116 --> 01:00:55,019
Sit down, my child. Guess what,
our company is going to be famous.

543
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:56,748
Thanks only to you...
- Why are you thanking me?

544
01:00:56,956 --> 01:00:59,925
I've done something
without asking you.

545
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:05,924
Our company is throwing a
big party on New Year's Eve.

546
01:01:06,132 --> 01:01:07,224
Oh, wow!

547
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:09,259
Guess, who's the chief guest?

548
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:10,163
Who...?

549
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:12,065
Your boyfriend.

550
01:01:12,338 --> 01:01:14,169
The man who owns Air Voice.

551
01:01:14,374 --> 01:01:17,866
Sanjay Singhania.

552
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:18,769
Sir...?

553
01:01:19,312 --> 01:01:23,146
And come what may,
you must get him to come.

554
01:01:23,817 --> 01:01:28,254
I'm sure you can, so I went ahead and
printed his name in the invitations.

555
01:01:29,155 --> 01:01:34,115
The biggest of agencies are coming,
top ad film makers, producers, directors.

556
01:01:34,694 --> 01:01:37,788
On whose say-so have
you printed his name?

557
01:01:37,997 --> 01:01:39,589
Where's the need to ask...?

558
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,730
It's the New Years Eve party.
You're coming.

559
01:01:43,937 --> 01:01:47,373
He'll accompany you.
- But I can't invite him!

560
01:01:48,007 --> 01:01:48,473
Why?

561
01:01:50,009 --> 01:01:52,136
We've... had a fight!

562
01:01:53,346 --> 01:01:55,906
You don't say!
All invitations have been distributed.

563
01:01:56,115 --> 01:01:58,675
You've got to make up with him
... got to get him to the party.

564
01:01:58,885 --> 01:02:00,512
But how...?
- Otherwise, I'll lose face.

565
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,621
On whose say-so did you print this?

566
01:02:03,923 --> 01:02:07,552
I would've told you,
but it slipped my mind.

567
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,524
What you've done is so wrong,
hundred percent wrong!

568
01:02:10,763 --> 01:02:14,824
Please, or you'll break everyone's heart.
- Where will I get Sanjay Singhania?

569
01:02:15,034 --> 01:02:18,470
Everyone's dying to see him,
not one of us has ever met him.

570
01:02:20,907 --> 01:02:21,498
What...?

571
01:02:22,475 --> 01:02:23,669
What about what?

572
01:02:24,544 --> 01:02:27,240
Not one of us has ever met him?

573
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,914
How could we?
He has just returned from America.

574
01:02:30,717 --> 01:02:32,275
Then I just...
must get him.

575
01:02:32,886 --> 01:02:34,911
Consider it done

576
01:02:35,154 --> 01:02:39,352
Kalpana is like a magic wand!
One flourish and you've got your wish.

577
01:02:40,126 --> 01:02:41,787
Thank you very much

578
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,063
Dialogue... dialogue!

579
01:02:49,536 --> 01:02:53,267
Hi, I'm Sanjay. Sanjay Singhania.

580
01:02:53,473 --> 01:02:54,497
Perfect.

581
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:56,207
Very good.

582
01:02:57,076 --> 01:02:57,974
Mind it.

583
01:02:58,177 --> 01:03:01,374
At tonight's party,
you're Sanjay Singhania.

584
01:03:03,249 --> 01:03:04,045
One second...

585
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:13,650
Listen, that's a friend of mine.
You'll pretend to be Sanjay Singhania.

586
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,827
If he's convinced,
then you pass muster. Okay?

587
01:03:19,365 --> 01:03:20,161
Ready?

588
01:03:22,502 --> 01:03:23,059
Hi...

589
01:03:23,269 --> 01:03:25,032
Hush!

590
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:26,096
What happened?

591
01:03:27,106 --> 01:03:28,073
Sanjay is here.

592
01:03:28,274 --> 01:03:29,002
Sanjay?

593
01:03:29,776 --> 01:03:31,801
Sanjay Singhania, my boyfriend.

594
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:48,320
Where... is he?
- Where are you looking...?

595
01:03:49,128 --> 01:03:49,651
Here!

596
01:03:50,964 --> 01:03:51,726
Sachin,

597
01:03:52,031 --> 01:03:53,259
meet Mr Sanjay.

598
01:03:54,133 --> 01:03:57,296
Hi, I'm Sanjay. Sanjay Singhania.

599
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:58,962
What... who...?

600
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,438
He is... Sanjay Singhania.

601
01:04:03,643 --> 01:04:04,337
Him...?

602
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,342
Are you joking?
Sanjay Singhania, and him?

603
01:04:25,898 --> 01:04:28,594
Stupid amateur, duffer, idiot!

604
01:04:28,801 --> 01:04:30,598
What did I do...?

605
01:04:30,803 --> 01:04:35,137
The big fish never put out their hands first.
Why did you hold out your hand?

606
01:04:35,642 --> 01:04:39,271
So when do I shake hands?
- You just don't do it!

607
01:04:39,479 --> 01:04:41,970
Go to hell, go do ads!
You've ruined it all.

608
01:04:43,983 --> 01:04:44,642
Idiot!

609
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,682
What happened?

610
01:04:49,288 --> 01:04:52,815
Sachin, shall I tell you something?

611
01:04:53,026 --> 01:04:53,617
What?

612
01:04:53,826 --> 01:04:55,817
You're going to be stunned...

613
01:04:56,262 --> 01:04:56,956
Try me.

614
01:04:57,163 --> 01:04:59,961
I'm not in love with Sanjay Singhania.

615
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:00,989
What?

616
01:05:03,936 --> 01:05:05,164
Actually,

617
01:05:06,139 --> 01:05:07,936
everyone at my workplace thought...

618
01:05:08,141 --> 01:05:09,506
he's my boyfriend.

619
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,678
So, everyone began to respect me.

620
01:05:15,381 --> 01:05:17,110
I played along.

621
01:05:18,951 --> 01:05:21,943
I don't even know what he looks like!

622
01:05:24,057 --> 01:05:26,218
So... what's next?

623
01:05:26,959 --> 01:05:28,893
My boss is hosting a party tonight.

624
01:05:29,095 --> 01:05:32,622
Without even asking me, they sent out
invites naming Sanjay as the chief guest.

625
01:05:32,832 --> 01:05:37,394
So I was preparing this mule for tonight,
but you caught him out in a second!

626
01:05:38,404 --> 01:05:40,429
What am I going to do now?

627
01:05:41,874 --> 01:05:44,172
Relax... I'm right here for you.

628
01:05:44,677 --> 01:05:46,269
I'll train him.

629
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,138
Listen... what's your name?

630
01:05:49,749 --> 01:05:55,085
Hi, I'm Sanjay. Sanjay Singhania.
- No... your real name?

631
01:05:55,521 --> 01:05:57,148
Sampat.
- Look Sampat...

632
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:59,548
cut that extra swagger.

633
01:05:59,759 --> 01:06:02,023
Be relaxed and easy... confident.

634
01:06:02,595 --> 01:06:05,325
Let me show how...
Hi, I'm Sanjay... Sanjay Singhania.

635
01:06:05,531 --> 01:06:10,764
Stop. Don't teach me acting.
I belong in theatre, I've done four plays.

636
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:13,962
I was putting out a first class act,
then he walked in and things went awry.

637
01:06:14,173 --> 01:06:15,834
Hey... take off that coat.

638
01:06:16,843 --> 01:06:20,335
Take it off, get out of that coat!
- I have a shoot tomorrow. It's my only coat.

639
01:06:20,546 --> 01:06:24,277
I just canceled your shoot. You're good only
for rubber slippers, snap out of it!

640
01:06:27,186 --> 01:06:27,982
Who, me...?
- Wear it.

641
01:06:36,629 --> 01:06:39,564
Oh yes!
You are... looking smart.

642
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,867
Put on the goggles.

643
01:06:46,472 --> 01:06:48,406
Oh wow!

644
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:50,140
Perfect!

645
01:06:51,811 --> 01:06:52,675
Perfect!

646
01:06:53,846 --> 01:06:57,646
Sachin! Come for tonight's party.
Be Sanjay.

647
01:06:58,518 --> 01:06:59,610
Please?

648
01:07:00,153 --> 01:07:01,620
Please say yes!

649
01:07:02,421 --> 01:07:03,251
Please!

650
01:07:04,957 --> 01:07:05,855
Please say yes...?

651
01:07:06,859 --> 01:07:07,348
Okay.

652
01:07:07,827 --> 01:07:08,293
Yes!

653
01:07:08,494 --> 01:07:11,190
Welcome to our chief guest,
Mr Sanjay Singhania

654
01:07:18,905 --> 01:07:19,872
Oh hi...
- Hello.

655
01:07:21,574 --> 01:07:23,599
Having a nice time?
- Yes, thank you.

656
01:07:27,947 --> 01:07:28,606
Kalpana

657
01:07:29,282 --> 01:07:31,580
Did you invite him properly?
- Yes, sir!

658
01:07:32,518 --> 01:07:36,579
If he turns up for real,
everyone'll go mad.

659
01:07:38,624 --> 01:07:39,921
If he doesn't turn up,

660
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,225
then I'll go mad.

661
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:48,027
Madam...

662
01:07:49,235 --> 01:07:54,002
The coat is ready. Just give me the go
and I'll give you a grand entry.

663
01:07:54,207 --> 01:07:56,539
I've rehearsed it thoroughly.

664
01:07:57,877 --> 01:08:00,778
I'm Sanjay Singhania...
oh hello Sanjay.

665
01:08:02,882 --> 01:08:03,814
Get out of my face.

666
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,176
You fool!

667
01:08:08,054 --> 01:08:09,578
Hi Kalpana...
- Hi!

668
01:08:10,256 --> 01:08:11,382
Mr Singhania has arrived.

669
01:08:27,673 --> 01:08:31,541
Who told him to get a car like that?
I'm not footing this bill.

670
01:08:32,445 --> 01:08:35,608
Oh... thank you.

671
01:08:36,182 --> 01:08:37,012
How wonderful!

672
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:42,714
He hasn't begun acting and all these fools have
already taken him for Sanjay Singhania?

673
01:08:43,923 --> 01:08:45,083
Oh yes, yes...

674
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:46,887
Will you hold this, please?

675
01:08:47,927 --> 01:08:48,916
Hi darling!

676
01:08:50,196 --> 01:08:52,528
Sorry, I'm late... my God!
You're looking gorgeous... come.

677
01:08:52,732 --> 01:08:55,292
Welcome to this party.
- Thank you.

678
01:08:57,103 --> 01:08:57,899
Hello... hello...

679
01:08:58,104 --> 01:08:59,435
Hello sir!

680
01:09:00,306 --> 01:09:00,829
Sorry.

681
01:09:00,973 --> 01:09:02,270
Welcome, sir.
- Thank you.

682
01:09:02,475 --> 01:09:07,105
Myself, Satveer Kohli. I'm Kalpana's director
and I run this ad film company.

683
01:09:07,313 --> 01:09:09,941
Hello sir, how are you?
- Thank you sir, I'm very good.

684
01:09:10,516 --> 01:09:13,815
I happen to be the one who insisted that
Kalpana must say yes to you.

685
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,844
I see...?

686
01:09:16,389 --> 01:09:19,085
You never told him!
- Of course I told him...

687
01:09:19,392 --> 01:09:21,758
I told you...?
- Oh... yes...

688
01:09:21,961 --> 01:09:23,121
Autograph, please?

689
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:28,498
I read your article in Economic Times.
I fully agree with your policy suggestions.

690
01:09:28,701 --> 01:09:32,262
Please leave him alone...
don't disturb him.

691
01:09:32,471 --> 01:09:34,439
Please come, dinner is ready.

692
01:09:41,981 --> 01:09:43,243
That was too close an embrace.

693
01:09:45,384 --> 01:09:47,511
And that was a kiss in public.

694
01:09:50,222 --> 01:09:51,814
I've done a hundred ads.

695
01:09:52,224 --> 01:09:54,749
Ninety in groups. Ten, solo.

696
01:09:55,194 --> 01:09:59,221
You learn how to respect your seniors or,
you're getting nowhere in life.

697
01:10:04,904 --> 01:10:06,337
I don't believe this.

698
01:10:07,273 --> 01:10:07,932
What?

699
01:10:08,207 --> 01:10:09,469
I just can't believe...

700
01:10:09,675 --> 01:10:11,472
Why not...?

701
01:10:11,677 --> 01:10:14,942
Can't believe that I'm sitting
in such august presence...

702
01:10:16,015 --> 01:10:17,778
Still, he's right amongst us.

703
01:10:21,954 --> 01:10:22,648
Excuse me...

704
01:10:26,525 --> 01:10:27,719
Some ice, please?

705
01:10:28,194 --> 01:10:29,752
So much cold is good enough for you.

706
01:10:31,564 --> 01:10:34,158
Over-acting. He'll get caught.

707
01:10:34,467 --> 01:10:36,025
Please get lost.

708
01:10:39,905 --> 01:10:40,872
Excuse me...

709
01:10:41,707 --> 01:10:44,141
We're from the Dinanath Charitable Trust.

710
01:10:44,543 --> 01:10:46,238
It's an orphanage for girls.

711
01:10:46,445 --> 01:10:47,537
And...?

712
01:10:47,747 --> 01:10:50,181
If you may make a contribution,
we'll be grateful.

713
01:10:50,449 --> 01:10:52,849
Who goes around with cash nowadays?

714
01:10:53,052 --> 01:10:54,485
Your cheque will do.

715
01:10:55,955 --> 01:10:56,751
Cheque?

716
01:10:57,323 --> 01:11:00,019
Who goes to parties with chequebooks?

717
01:11:02,294 --> 01:11:04,626
What are you upto?

718
01:11:04,897 --> 01:11:06,023
Whose chequebook is that?

719
01:11:06,332 --> 01:11:08,266
Even for over-acting, this is too loud!

720
01:11:11,137 --> 01:11:13,799
Five hundred thousand?
Have you gone mad?

721
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:17,240
Thank you, sir.
- All the best.

722
01:11:20,246 --> 01:11:21,008
I'm finished.

723
01:11:25,317 --> 01:11:26,909
I could kill you.

724
01:11:27,553 --> 01:11:29,214
Our leading model, Sonal.

725
01:11:29,422 --> 01:11:30,582
How do you do?
- I'm very good.

726
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:34,556
Kalpana has told us so much about you...
- We all know that... there're others...

727
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:39,163
That article of yours in Economic Times.
- Not again, sir. Please...

728
01:11:47,006 --> 01:11:49,304
You... for Sanjay Singhania!

729
01:11:49,508 --> 01:11:51,237
And they fell for you?

730
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:59,246
Am I'm too clever,
or it's a world of fools?

731
01:12:15,134 --> 01:12:15,896
I love you.

732
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:17,959
What?

733
01:12:21,073 --> 01:12:25,134
I love you.
I want to marry you.

734
01:12:29,048 --> 01:12:31,710
What... so all of a sudden...?

735
01:12:34,353 --> 01:12:35,320
Not so... all of a sudden.

736
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:42,355
I never thought...

737
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,865
Give me time, to think.

738
01:12:50,503 --> 01:12:52,471
Shall I tell you tomorrow?

739
01:12:59,512 --> 01:13:02,106
If I say no, you won't take it badly?

740
01:13:15,027 --> 01:13:15,550
Bye.

741
01:13:18,731 --> 01:13:19,663
Happy new year.

742
01:13:21,233 --> 01:13:22,063
Happy new year.

743
01:13:35,848 --> 01:13:37,679
To her, I'm just an ordinary guy.

744
01:13:39,084 --> 01:13:40,346
I wish to remain this unexceptional man...

745
01:13:40,553 --> 01:13:41,952
who wins her love.

746
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:46,822
So I haven't told her the truth about me.

747
01:13:49,461 --> 01:13:51,361
If she accepts me,

748
01:13:53,232 --> 01:13:55,894
then I'll confess to being Sanjay Singhania.

749
01:13:58,170 --> 01:13:59,694
If she refuses,

750
01:14:01,373 --> 01:14:02,032
then I remain Sachin...

751
01:14:02,241 --> 01:14:05,699
and I fade out of her life.

752
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,809
All I await now, is tomorrow.

753
01:14:20,993 --> 01:14:22,927
End of the diary.
December 31st.

754
01:14:23,762 --> 01:14:27,892
Next day, next year... 2006.

755
01:14:36,842 --> 01:14:39,208
Hey... hey...

756
01:14:39,545 --> 01:14:40,603
The next day, what happened...?

757
01:14:40,879 --> 01:14:43,245
What did she say...
what happened to her?

758
01:14:43,449 --> 01:14:44,973
How did you end up like this?

759
01:14:45,184 --> 01:14:47,709
Speak up!

760
01:16:45,938 --> 01:16:46,666
Hello, sir.

761
01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:48,206
I'm your manager.

762
01:16:49,074 --> 01:16:49,938
Pankaj Shroff.

763
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,044
Hello Sanjay.

764
01:16:56,248 --> 01:16:58,614
I'm your doctor. Dr Peston Wadia.

765
01:17:00,052 --> 01:17:01,542
Not enough sleep.

766
01:17:01,754 --> 01:17:04,086
Are up keeping up till late?

767
01:17:04,289 --> 01:17:07,725
Sir, I'm telling you again,

768
01:17:07,926 --> 01:17:10,918
it's fine if you won't go to the office,
it's okay, no problem.

769
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:15,157
But live in your mansion,
why this tiny flat?

770
01:17:16,769 --> 01:17:20,364
We can get a nurse, a chauffeur here...?

771
01:17:21,206 --> 01:17:22,639
I need no one.

772
01:17:25,277 --> 01:17:26,073
Thank you.

773
01:17:30,282 --> 01:17:32,147
Kill Ghajini.
Check invitation on Calendar.

774
01:17:34,586 --> 01:17:37,419

01:17:40,893 --> 01:17:43,521
Chief Guest: Mr Ghajini Dharmatma

776
01:17:49,768 --> 01:17:53,704
Sir... you're... here...
for our college culture fest?

777
01:17:56,575 --> 01:17:58,065
Oh, I'm sorry.

778
01:17:58,544 --> 01:18:01,877
You won't know me...
I mean, you know me.

779
01:18:02,114 --> 01:18:03,172
I've met you.

780
01:18:04,183 --> 01:18:07,311
Sanjay Singhania...
short term memory loss.

781
01:18:07,786 --> 01:18:08,582
Come on, it's nearly time.

782
01:18:08,787 --> 01:18:09,776
One minute...

783
01:18:10,055 --> 01:18:11,420
We're getting late.
Sunita, let's go.

784
01:18:11,623 --> 01:18:14,387
Don't leave before my performance
... second song.

785
01:18:23,735 --> 01:18:28,434
Girls and boys... please
... calm down.

786
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:35,170
Our chief guest for the
evening has arrived.

787
01:18:35,714 --> 01:18:39,946
He has patronised our college for long.

788
01:18:40,285 --> 01:18:43,846
I'd like you to give him
a hearty welcome.

789
01:18:44,256 --> 01:18:45,280
Boys and girls,

790
01:18:45,491 --> 01:18:48,119
please welcome Mr. Ghajini Dharmatma.

791
01:19:57,963 --> 01:19:59,555
Crazy, crazy!

792
01:19:59,765 --> 01:20:01,665
I'm crazy about him

793
01:20:10,309 --> 01:20:11,901
Why's my body going crazy?

794
01:20:12,377 --> 01:20:14,208
Why's my heart beating crazy?

795
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:16,344
I want to dance,

796
01:20:16,615 --> 01:20:18,606
uninhibited

797
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:22,911
Who's come into my heart today?
What's this scent of love?

798
01:20:23,155 --> 01:20:26,022
Dancing bells are on my feet,
it's my season of youth

799
01:20:30,963 --> 01:20:32,021
Hello

800
01:20:37,069 --> 01:20:38,297
Crazy,

801
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:40,471
I'm crazy for him!

802
01:20:44,676 --> 01:20:46,701
He's my love

803
01:20:53,986 --> 01:20:59,618
His coming has filled the
emptinesses in my heart

804
01:20:59,925 --> 01:21:03,383
He only has to make a sign
and I'll become his slave

805
01:21:26,151 --> 01:21:28,483
Go outside, find out who's calling.

806
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:35,917
Hello?

807
01:21:36,795 --> 01:21:38,262
Get down to the basement car park.

808
01:21:38,463 --> 01:21:39,054
What...?

809
01:21:58,417 --> 01:21:59,247
Who's that?

810
01:22:01,386 --> 01:22:02,444
What are you doing there?

811
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:08,484
Damn you!

812
01:23:11,223 --> 01:23:11,689
Hey...

813
01:23:12,891 --> 01:23:19,694
Hey...

814
01:23:33,078 --> 01:23:34,204
Who was that?

815
01:23:36,915 --> 01:23:38,644
Who tried to kill you?

816
01:23:39,451 --> 01:23:41,715
Not me...

817
01:23:44,656 --> 01:23:45,418
he came to kill you.

818
01:23:45,624 --> 01:23:46,249
Me...?

819
01:23:47,926 --> 01:23:50,360
Came to kill me?
Who was he?

820
01:23:51,263 --> 01:23:52,662
Who was it... who?

821
01:23:53,932 --> 01:23:55,559
Two years ago...

822
01:23:55,767 --> 01:23:58,429
Two years ago... what...?

823
01:24:00,172 --> 01:24:01,264
What was it two years ago?

824
01:24:02,574 --> 01:24:04,041
What...?

825
01:24:04,442 --> 01:24:06,137
Give me his name.

826
01:24:06,344 --> 01:24:07,504
The name!

827
01:24:07,712 --> 01:24:09,236
His name, who was he?

828
01:24:09,447 --> 01:24:11,813
Who wants to kill me?

829
01:24:13,251 --> 01:24:15,549
He's dead.

830
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:19,420
Shit.

831
01:24:24,029 --> 01:24:29,433
Two years ago?
What did I do two years ago?

832
01:24:30,135 --> 01:24:33,536
Which jobs did I get done
two years ago?

833
01:24:35,006 --> 01:24:39,705
Which ones are after my life?

834
01:24:40,979 --> 01:24:44,244
A list... make a list of them all.

835
01:24:44,816 --> 01:24:48,479
I must have the list tomorrow.
You get it?

836
01:24:57,929 --> 01:24:58,896
Excuse me

837
01:24:59,898 --> 01:25:02,366
Where is Mr Sanjay Singhania's flat?

838
01:25:02,734 --> 01:25:04,065
Fourth floor. 401.

839
01:25:04,502 --> 01:25:05,264
Thanks

840
01:25:16,581 --> 01:25:17,377
Sir...

841
01:25:21,052 --> 01:25:21,950
Sir...?

842
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:32,628
Sir...

843
01:25:55,887 --> 01:25:57,320
Kill him

844
01:25:59,057 --> 01:26:00,046
Revenge

845
01:26:00,558 --> 01:26:01,547
Ghajini?

846
01:26:01,893 --> 01:26:03,224
She was murdered

847
01:26:06,064 --> 01:26:07,292
Find him Kill him

848
01:26:13,605 --> 01:26:14,765
Done

849
01:26:18,276 --> 01:26:19,402
Over

850
01:26:19,611 --> 01:26:21,238
Ghajini 10 June 2008

851
01:26:31,957 --> 01:26:36,326
Doctor... restaurant... theatre...

852
01:26:57,983 --> 01:27:00,178
Don't open

853
01:27:04,723 --> 01:27:05,815
I'm a police officer.

854
01:27:06,024 --> 01:27:08,015
Untie me. I'm a police officer.

855
01:27:24,876 --> 01:27:28,004
Get out of here! Fast!
He's a murderer.

856
01:27:28,213 --> 01:27:30,204
Don't you hear?

857
01:27:30,415 --> 01:27:31,609
Just get the hell out of here!

858
01:27:48,199 --> 01:27:49,029
Who are you?

859
01:27:52,771 --> 01:27:53,795
What are you doing here?

860
01:30:31,496 --> 01:30:32,622
The other shade.

861
01:30:47,979 --> 01:30:57,945
BIGPictures

862
01:31:02,227 --> 01:31:02,955
Shall we...?

863
01:31:05,863 --> 01:31:07,558
You've forgotten so quickly?

864
01:31:08,199 --> 01:31:09,564
I was buying nail polish.

865
01:31:11,803 --> 01:31:12,565
Look...

866
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:16,069
My friend... you wrote that out.

867
01:31:16,874 --> 01:31:17,932
Now, come on.

868
01:31:32,223 --> 01:31:36,853
Have I been I chasing you?
- Why should you...? I'm your friend.

869
01:31:37,328 --> 01:31:39,159
No! I'm chasing you.

870
01:31:39,764 --> 01:31:41,755
I'm breathing hard,
you're out of breath.

871
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,433
I'm sweating. Even you are...

872
01:31:44,335 --> 01:31:46,269
Hey! You're smoking in a public place!

873
01:31:46,571 --> 01:31:48,698
Have you no sense of decency?
Idiots.

874
01:31:48,906 --> 01:31:49,600
You're right!

875
01:31:49,807 --> 01:31:51,866
You ought to thrash some
sense into them.

876
01:31:52,076 --> 01:31:54,476
Go on, teach them such a
lesson that they'll quit smoking.

877
01:31:54,746 --> 01:31:56,270
Go... hit them.

878
01:31:57,348 --> 01:32:00,078
You'll teach us lessons?

879
01:32:00,385 --> 01:32:01,477
You're going to hit us?

880
01:32:01,686 --> 01:32:02,550
Come on.

881
01:32:02,754 --> 01:32:04,915
You'll take on all of us?
Come on.

882
01:32:05,123 --> 01:32:06,784
Hit us.
- Come on.

883
01:32:34,352 --> 01:32:36,684
Ghajini... listen...

884
01:32:37,655 --> 01:32:39,418
don't do it.

885
01:32:39,624 --> 01:32:42,684
In four years,
we haven't had any quarrels.

886
01:32:43,094 --> 01:32:44,425
Why do you want to kill me?

887
01:32:44,629 --> 01:32:45,459
Who told you?

888
01:32:45,863 --> 01:32:48,798
I don't care if you want to kill me or not.

889
01:32:49,467 --> 01:32:52,766
I only want to finish off all my enemies.

890
01:32:54,305 --> 01:32:54,964
Shoot.

891
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,684
Everyone's dead.

892
01:33:19,263 --> 01:33:20,321
Why are you still anxious?

893
01:33:22,033 --> 01:33:26,231
No... he's still alive.

894
01:33:27,372 --> 01:33:29,169
He wasn't anyone of them.

895
01:33:32,477 --> 01:33:35,207
These men were afraid of me.

896
01:33:36,447 --> 01:33:39,382
But this is someone else...

897
01:33:40,418 --> 01:33:42,352
someone I'm missing.

898
01:33:43,554 --> 01:33:45,681
A girl is here, asking for you.

899
01:33:46,124 --> 01:33:46,920
What girl?

900
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:50,617
My name is Sunita.
I am a medical student.

901
01:33:51,362 --> 01:33:54,024
I visited a patient
at his home, recently.

902
01:33:54,599 --> 01:33:57,329
He is planning to kill you.

903
01:33:58,903 --> 01:34:04,170
He has already killed two others.
I have seen photos of the dead men.

904
01:34:04,742 --> 01:34:08,906
He is an extremely dangerous man.
I saw him trying to kill a policeman.

905
01:34:09,113 --> 01:34:14,107
The policeman got killed in an accident.
After that he came after me, to kill me.

906
01:34:16,954 --> 01:34:18,819
Look... your photo.

907
01:34:19,524 --> 01:34:20,855
A date is inscribed underneath.

908
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:28,794
I was about to go to the police.
But if my college gets to know, I'm in a mess.

909
01:34:29,567 --> 01:34:32,195
I just couldn't sit on it,
so I came to you.

910
01:34:32,403 --> 01:34:33,802
To warn you.

911
01:34:35,306 --> 01:34:38,241
His photo...
the man who wants to kill you.

912
01:34:44,749 --> 01:34:48,207
Mr Sanjay Singhania. 31 years.
Short term memory loss

913
01:35:08,806 --> 01:35:11,036
Short term memory loss.

914
01:35:13,945 --> 01:35:20,214
A man who forgets everything in
fifteen minutes is planning to kill me.

915
01:35:21,786 --> 01:35:24,914
He even named a day for my death?

916
01:35:26,123 --> 01:35:28,819
I got to fix a time for him to die.

917
01:35:29,861 --> 01:35:34,696
12 hours. This man will be
on earth no more.

918
01:36:05,663 --> 01:36:06,425
The boss?

919
01:36:07,532 --> 01:36:08,658
Watch out.

920
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,224
He's away from home.

921
01:36:10,701 --> 01:36:15,035
If he goes your way, you kill him.
If he comes this way, I'll kill the bastard.

922
01:36:15,306 --> 01:36:16,034
Sure.

923
01:37:16,534 --> 01:37:18,764
I'm into this problem...

924
01:37:18,936 --> 01:37:19,425
What...?

925
01:37:19,837 --> 01:37:21,395
He has my photo.

926
01:37:21,606 --> 01:37:24,074
Who has...?
- That Sanjay Singhania... he has it.

927
01:37:24,275 --> 01:37:25,708
Isn't it the one?

928
01:37:25,943 --> 01:37:28,434
He has another one.
He had taken two photos.

929
01:37:28,646 --> 01:37:30,477
You're the problem.

930
01:37:30,748 --> 01:37:34,013
If it ends up with the police,
I'm in a fix.

931
01:37:34,552 --> 01:37:39,888
Ask Mr Ghajini. He's looking for that guy,
he'll get the photo for you.

932
01:37:57,642 --> 01:37:59,542
Hello, Mr Ghajini...?

933
01:38:01,178 --> 01:38:01,837
Hello...

934
01:38:06,417 --> 01:38:07,315
Mr Ghajini...?

935
01:38:08,986 --> 01:38:09,509
Yes

936
01:38:09,987 --> 01:38:11,818
I'm Sunita...

937
01:38:12,156 --> 01:38:15,887
I met you about Sanjay Singhania.

938
01:38:17,662 --> 01:38:18,253
Who...?

939
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:19,963
Sanjay Singhania,

940
01:38:20,164 --> 01:38:21,995
the man who wants to kill you.

941
01:38:22,433 --> 01:38:24,901
The one with the 15-minute memory...

942
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:30,198
He has a problem remembering,
but best to be cautious.

943
01:38:30,408 --> 01:38:32,933
He's an extremely dangerous man.

944
01:38:33,144 --> 01:38:38,377
You see, he has a photo of mine.

945
01:38:39,016 --> 01:38:40,711
Do what you will to him,

946
01:38:40,918 --> 01:38:43,580
but get me my photo, please.

947
01:38:44,088 --> 01:38:46,886
He took my photo in the college canteen.

948
01:38:52,463 --> 01:38:53,828
What are you wearing in the photo?

949
01:38:54,031 --> 01:38:55,794
Blue top and blue jeans.

950
01:38:59,837 --> 01:39:01,771
Let me find it, I'll send it to you.

951
01:39:02,707 --> 01:39:03,731
What's your address?

952
01:40:47,278 --> 01:40:48,404
Warden...!

953
01:40:48,612 --> 01:40:49,374
Hurry...

954
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:52,378
Help me, please! Help me!

955
01:41:03,561 --> 01:41:04,459
Excuse me.

956
01:41:04,662 --> 01:41:05,424
Stay away.

957
01:41:05,629 --> 01:41:06,493
Where's the lift?

958
01:41:06,697 --> 01:41:07,891
Between second and third floors.

959
01:41:08,098 --> 01:41:09,122
Put on the main switch.

960
01:42:26,176 --> 01:42:27,302
His diaries.

961
01:43:09,053 --> 01:43:11,180
If she accepts me,

962
01:43:12,089 --> 01:43:14,683
then I'll confess to being Sanjay Singhania.

963
01:43:15,626 --> 01:43:17,355
If she refuses,

964
01:43:17,795 --> 01:43:19,854
then I remain Sachin...

965
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,463
and I fade out of her life.

966
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:24,367
All I await now, is tomorrow.

967
01:43:53,163 --> 01:43:56,621
This wait for a yes will keep me up tonight.

968
01:43:57,701 --> 01:44:00,169
This suspense is haunting,

969
01:44:00,371 --> 01:44:01,668
how can I sleep tonight?

970
01:44:02,706 --> 01:44:06,164
To what news my morning light will dawn,

971
01:44:07,378 --> 01:44:09,005
to melodies of love like rain?

972
01:44:09,713 --> 01:44:12,511
Or, is this thirst to go unquenched?

973
01:44:34,738 --> 01:44:37,707
Like a passion, unfulfilled

974
01:44:37,908 --> 01:44:40,376
You hold me in an ecstasy, thrilled

975
01:44:40,577 --> 01:44:43,375
And now,

976
01:44:49,086 --> 01:44:50,553
the consummation,

977
01:44:50,754 --> 01:44:51,880
of that ecstasy,

978
01:44:52,156 --> 01:44:54,215
in your arms,

979
01:44:54,425 --> 01:44:57,553
is all I wish from you

980
01:44:57,761 --> 01:45:00,389
In my heart of hearts, how I pine

981
01:45:00,597 --> 01:45:03,395
To splash you with my colours of life

982
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,727
In every mood, to match my rhythm

983
01:45:05,936 --> 01:45:08,404
It's all I wish from you

984
01:45:09,173 --> 01:45:11,733
If only you say yes, then life...

985
01:45:11,942 --> 01:45:14,740
can spring forth from the fountainhead...

986
01:45:14,945 --> 01:45:20,076
to spew my pearls of life upon your path

987
01:45:24,054 --> 01:45:25,578
Consummation...

988
01:45:25,789 --> 01:45:26,915
of that ecstasy...

989
01:45:27,191 --> 01:45:28,590
in your arms...

990
01:45:28,792 --> 01:45:31,260
is all I wish

991
01:46:05,829 --> 01:46:08,297
My gossamer dreams are cast in glass

992
01:46:08,499 --> 01:46:11,127
As I ford my nights in dark

993
01:46:11,335 --> 01:46:16,466
Fearful, lest my fantasies shatter

994
01:46:17,007 --> 01:46:19,635
My hopes are inflamed

995
01:46:19,843 --> 01:46:22,471
Yet I fear, lest some tempest...

996
01:46:22,679 --> 01:46:27,810
puts out my flame

997
01:46:28,018 --> 01:46:33,479
I wait for a lone yes

998
01:46:33,690 --> 01:46:38,821
To turn on the springs of joy...

999
01:46:39,029 --> 01:46:42,157
in a culmination...

1000
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:44,833
of my dreams...

1001
01:46:45,035 --> 01:46:49,995
in the ecstasy of your embrace

1002
01:46:50,274 --> 01:46:53,835
It's all I wish

1003
01:47:16,233 --> 01:47:19,031
I have my Moon, over me my skies

1004
01:47:19,303 --> 01:47:21,863
Where dense dark clouds also hover

1005
01:47:22,072 --> 01:47:27,032
I wish this Moon is never overcast

1006
01:47:27,311 --> 01:47:30,212
A searing loneliness,

1007
01:47:30,414 --> 01:47:33,212
a pacing heart,

1008
01:47:33,417 --> 01:47:38,548
and not a moment's peace...

1009
01:47:38,755 --> 01:47:43,055
make up a wonderful story of mine;

1010
01:47:44,328 --> 01:47:49,732
I've only a restless yearning...

1011
01:47:49,933 --> 01:47:52,561
for a passion unfulfilled,

1012
01:47:52,769 --> 01:47:55,567
for an ecstasy, the thrill...

1013
01:47:55,772 --> 01:48:00,732
of your embrace

1014
01:48:00,944 --> 01:48:03,913
It's all I wish from you

1015
01:48:04,114 --> 01:48:06,912
In my heart of hearts, how I pine

1016
01:48:07,117 --> 01:48:09,745
To splash you with my colours of life

1017
01:48:09,953 --> 01:48:12,251
In every mood, to match my rhythm

1018
01:48:12,456 --> 01:48:15,425
It's all I wish from you

1019
01:48:15,626 --> 01:48:18,424
If only you say yes, then life...

1020
01:48:18,629 --> 01:48:21,257
can spring forth from the fountainhead...

1021
01:48:21,465 --> 01:48:26,596
to spew my pearls of life upon your path

1022
01:48:26,803 --> 01:48:30,603
For you, I thirst

1023
01:49:16,153 --> 01:49:17,882
All night, I kept thinking.

1024
01:49:19,189 --> 01:49:21,987
Until one o'clock it was, why you?

1025
01:49:23,126 --> 01:49:25,492
By two o'clock, it was why not?

1026
01:49:26,897 --> 01:49:28,296
At three am,

1027
01:49:28,532 --> 01:49:30,022
am I rushing into this?

1028
01:49:31,401 --> 01:49:34,336
At four, if not now then how will I ever...?

1029
01:49:35,038 --> 01:49:37,734
By the time it got to five o'c lock,
I had decided.

1030
01:49:39,276 --> 01:49:40,334
I do.

1031
01:49:47,918 --> 01:49:48,680
I love you.

1032
01:50:17,547 --> 01:50:19,447
Now's my turn to tell her who I am.

1033
01:50:19,649 --> 01:50:21,913
But you don't know who I am.

1034
01:50:22,619 --> 01:50:26,385
What...!
- When you get to know about my dad...

1035
01:50:26,556 --> 01:50:28,421
it'll blow your brains.

1036
01:50:28,625 --> 01:50:31,594
Is she talking my lines?

1037
01:50:32,562 --> 01:50:33,688
Take this.

1038
01:50:33,997 --> 01:50:39,094
In 1992, my dad had three Ambassador cars.

1039
01:50:40,604 --> 01:50:42,128
Oh wow...
- Oh yes.

1040
01:50:42,339 --> 01:50:44,705
He had a travel agency.
Shetty Travels.

1041
01:50:45,008 --> 01:50:47,943
Shitty Travels?
- Hey! Shetty... Travels.

1042
01:50:48,145 --> 01:50:50,306
Yes... I see... Shetty Travels.
- So.

1043
01:50:52,349 --> 01:50:54,340
It was my uncle who cheated him.

1044
01:50:54,551 --> 01:50:55,210
Ohh...

1045
01:50:55,986 --> 01:50:57,578
He stole all three cars.

1046
01:50:58,655 --> 01:51:00,748
Brokenhearted, my dad died.

1047
01:51:01,491 --> 01:51:03,220
That day, I swore...

1048
01:51:03,493 --> 01:51:06,394
until I buy three Ambassador cars,

1049
01:51:06,596 --> 01:51:08,359
I won't marry.

1050
01:51:09,566 --> 01:51:10,328
Three...?

1051
01:51:11,701 --> 01:51:13,100
Can't it climb down by a couple or so?

1052
01:51:14,037 --> 01:51:15,004
No way.

1053
01:51:16,173 --> 01:51:19,040
If you can wait, then wait.

1054
01:51:19,509 --> 01:51:20,237
Otherwise,

1055
01:51:20,444 --> 01:51:22,503
marry a girl of your class.

1056
01:51:25,415 --> 01:51:26,439
I'll wait.

1057
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:30,344
Don't worry.
Even after I'm rich,

1058
01:51:30,554 --> 01:51:33,955
I'll still be the same to you, like I'm now.

1059
01:51:34,658 --> 01:51:37,650
Promise?
- Promise.

1060
01:51:47,537 --> 01:51:48,504
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1061
01:51:48,705 --> 01:51:50,468
A very happy new year to you.
- Thank you.

1062
01:51:50,941 --> 01:51:52,533
Mr Goenka has canceled for the day.

1063
01:51:53,376 --> 01:51:55,435
The board meeting is at eleven thirty.

1064
01:51:56,112 --> 01:51:58,410
The marketing presentation is post-lunch.

1065
01:51:58,615 --> 01:51:59,172
Okay.

1066
01:52:04,421 --> 01:52:08,357
Sir... what did she say when
she got to know about you?

1067
01:52:10,994 --> 01:52:12,052
I haven't told her.

1068
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:14,289
Why, sir?

1069
01:52:16,466 --> 01:52:17,433
Because, in 1992...

1070
01:52:17,634 --> 01:52:19,932
her dad had three Ambassador cars.

1071
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:23,533
Her uncle tricked her dad out of the cars.

1072
01:52:24,441 --> 01:52:27,308
Now she wants to be richer than her uncle.

1073
01:52:28,011 --> 01:52:29,035
Until then, she won't marry.

1074
01:52:29,246 --> 01:52:31,043
What if you just told her...?

1075
01:52:31,248 --> 01:52:33,614
She'd want to be richer than me...

1076
01:52:34,050 --> 01:52:35,347
that'd be the end of my wedding.

1077
01:52:37,687 --> 01:52:42,351
Truth is, I prefer to keep up this facade.

1078
01:52:50,066 --> 01:52:51,829
I had bought this flat...
as my gift to her...

1079
01:52:53,069 --> 01:52:57,733
after telling her about me.
It's not to be,

1080
01:52:58,675 --> 01:53:00,404
but I got to give her the flat, somehow.

1081
01:53:01,077 --> 01:53:02,135
That's your responsibility.

1082
01:53:03,747 --> 01:53:04,645
It'll be done, sir.

1083
01:53:05,448 --> 01:53:06,073
Thanks.

1084
01:53:20,096 --> 01:53:21,358
May no one ever wish you ill.

1085
01:53:21,565 --> 01:53:23,260
And your tank forever be petrol-ful.

1086
01:53:37,647 --> 01:53:40,343
For me too... please.
- Quiet! There's enough for everyone.

1087
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:43,110
For me, too?
- Late, even today?

1088
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:44,810
You bought it?

1089
01:53:45,021 --> 01:53:46,716
Yes... surprise.

1090
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:50,084
One in. Two more to go.
- Great!

1091
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:52,724
I sold the jewellery meant
for my wedding.

1092
01:53:53,229 --> 01:53:54,719
Dear husband to-be,

1093
01:53:54,931 --> 01:53:56,398
I don't think, you care for a dowry.

1094
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:57,760
So, I bought a car.

1095
01:53:58,335 --> 01:54:00,235
Sure... it moves?

1096
01:54:01,504 --> 01:54:03,904
Are you joking?
Take a test drive.

1097
01:54:05,342 --> 01:54:05,967
Come on, kids.

1098
01:54:13,416 --> 01:54:14,610
Smooth drive, isn't it?

1099
01:54:14,951 --> 01:54:15,679
Smooth roads.

1100
01:54:15,885 --> 01:54:16,715
Hey...?

1101
01:54:18,288 --> 01:54:19,619
Smooth as butter.

1102
01:54:21,224 --> 01:54:23,852
The radio, there's one in there.
It works!

1103
01:54:43,913 --> 01:54:47,440
Hey, this car is mine!
I just bought it.

1104
01:54:47,651 --> 01:54:51,587
Nice, isn't it?
- What a pretty car!

1105
01:55:13,076 --> 01:55:13,838
Good news, sir.

1106
01:55:14,144 --> 01:55:15,372
The fax is in from London.

1107
01:55:15,578 --> 01:55:16,704
We've got the licence.

1108
01:55:16,913 --> 01:55:19,381
All calls to UK will be routed through us.

1109
01:55:19,582 --> 01:55:20,640
That's wonderful!

1110
01:55:20,917 --> 01:55:22,043
Give the good news to the staff.

1111
01:55:22,252 --> 01:55:23,947
Sure. You must go to
London immediately.

1112
01:55:24,154 --> 01:55:24,813
Yes

1113
01:55:29,359 --> 01:55:30,348
Hi, how are you?

1114
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:32,960
There's good news!

1115
01:55:33,163 --> 01:55:33,959
Strange!

1116
01:55:34,464 --> 01:55:37,627
She always pips me to the talking post?

1117
01:55:39,202 --> 01:55:40,294
Even I have something to tell you.

1118
01:55:40,503 --> 01:55:41,731
No. Me first.

1119
01:55:43,707 --> 01:55:44,401
Tell me.

1120
01:55:44,674 --> 01:55:48,440
I won a brand new flat in
an Air Voice lucky contest.

1121
01:55:49,446 --> 01:55:51,676
Air Voice lucky contest...?

1122
01:55:53,149 --> 01:55:56,778
Sir... that flat you wanted to give her...
I fixed a contest to do it.

1123
01:55:57,587 --> 01:55:59,612
Wow, that's great! Congratulations.

1124
01:55:59,823 --> 01:56:01,620
Not just congratulations.

1125
01:56:01,825 --> 01:56:03,452
Get over here in five minutes.

1126
01:56:04,027 --> 01:56:06,393
Kalpana, I'm a bit busy.
I can't come.

1127
01:56:06,596 --> 01:56:09,064
I'll hit you for pretending to be busy.

1128
01:56:09,666 --> 01:56:11,327
I'm giving you the address.
Come right away.

1129
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,544
Hi!

1130
01:56:24,748 --> 01:56:26,943
Hi... congratulations.

1131
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:28,139
Thank you

1132
01:56:29,819 --> 01:56:30,786
One second!

1133
01:56:35,258 --> 01:56:35,849
What's this?

1134
01:56:39,929 --> 01:56:41,487
You're taking your first step
into this home.

1135
01:56:41,698 --> 01:56:44,223
I want to capture it for posterity.

1136
01:56:48,505 --> 01:56:49,437
You too, come over.

1137
01:57:44,694 --> 01:57:45,490
Nice, isn't it?

1138
01:57:46,729 --> 01:57:47,423
Beautiful.

1139
01:57:47,630 --> 01:57:49,029
This is how it'll stay forever,

1140
01:57:49,232 --> 01:57:52,065
to remind us of the first step we took.

1141
01:58:03,012 --> 01:58:05,207
So! How is this home?

1142
01:58:06,549 --> 01:58:07,573
Fabulous!

1143
01:58:08,551 --> 01:58:11,315
New home, second hand car...

1144
01:58:11,421 --> 01:58:12,718
lucky strike?

1145
01:58:13,623 --> 01:58:15,090
I'm feeling so happy!

1146
01:58:15,425 --> 01:58:17,393
Weren't you saying something
on the phone?

1147
01:58:17,927 --> 01:58:23,888
Yes... I got to go out of town
for ten days.

1148
01:58:24,601 --> 01:58:25,499
Where to...?

1149
01:58:26,936 --> 01:58:27,868
My village.

1150
01:58:29,606 --> 01:58:31,665
Why, so suddenly?

1151
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:35,573
My mother is sick.

1152
01:58:37,113 --> 01:58:38,512
Then, bring her here.

1153
01:58:39,382 --> 01:58:42,317
I got to go, I have some property there...

1154
01:58:42,518 --> 01:58:43,815
two acres of land.

1155
01:58:44,120 --> 01:58:45,087
I got to sell it...

1156
01:58:45,288 --> 01:58:46,880
for my mother's medical treatment.

1157
01:58:49,025 --> 01:58:54,122
Ten days?
You'll come sooner, if you can...?

1158
01:58:54,998 --> 01:58:55,657
I will.

1159
01:58:57,367 --> 01:58:58,732
You will come, won't you?

1160
01:58:59,869 --> 01:59:01,393
What's it, why are you nervous?

1161
01:59:02,538 --> 01:59:06,167
I don't know, it's just an odd feeling.

1162
01:59:06,376 --> 01:59:07,434
Hey...

1163
01:59:10,413 --> 01:59:11,744
Silly you.

1164
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:18,678
All the rest are standard clauses.

1165
01:59:18,788 --> 01:59:20,517
I think we've covered everything, right?

1166
01:59:20,723 --> 01:59:22,588
Yes, we've clarified all the points.

1167
01:59:23,493 --> 01:59:26,758
I'll need a hard copy on the flight.

1168
01:59:26,996 --> 01:59:27,462
Will be done.

1169
01:59:27,664 --> 01:59:30,030
Make sure, all changes are incorporated.
- Right.

1170
01:59:30,233 --> 01:59:31,996
Yes...?
- Sir, we're getting late.

1171
01:59:33,069 --> 01:59:36,197
It's one o'clock!
All right, let's pack.

1172
01:59:37,807 --> 01:59:39,001
Thank you, gentlemen.

1173
01:59:45,515 --> 01:59:46,174
Hello?

1174
01:59:46,382 --> 01:59:49,146
Hello Sachin... Kalpana.
- Yes Kalpana?

1175
01:59:49,385 --> 01:59:50,716
I got to see you right away.

1176
01:59:51,487 --> 01:59:53,250
Come over to my old place.

1177
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:57,388
It's one am. Say, what's the matter?

1178
01:59:58,061 --> 02:00:02,623
I got to see you before you leave.
Please.

1179
02:00:04,667 --> 02:00:05,964
All right. I'm coming.

1180
02:00:20,483 --> 02:00:21,677
Why are you standing on the street?

1181
02:00:22,085 --> 02:00:24,053
Just waiting, for you.

1182
02:00:30,126 --> 02:00:32,754
So... why did you call me?

1183
02:00:43,373 --> 02:00:44,237
What's this?

1184
02:00:45,208 --> 02:00:47,233
One hundred and thirty five thousand.

1185
02:00:47,610 --> 02:00:49,134
For your mother's treatment.

1186
02:00:51,981 --> 02:00:53,175
Where did you get so much money?

1187
02:00:54,283 --> 02:00:55,341
I sold my car.

1188
02:00:55,551 --> 02:00:57,451
What... why?

1189
02:00:59,122 --> 02:01:01,590
You would've sold the land.

1190
02:01:02,592 --> 02:01:05,459
Don't sell it. It's an inheritance.

1191
02:01:06,396 --> 02:01:08,557
A car... I can buy again.

1192
02:01:11,067 --> 02:01:11,692
But...

1193
02:01:14,203 --> 02:01:15,602
you wanted the car so much!

1194
02:01:15,905 --> 02:01:16,530
Forget it.

1195
02:01:16,739 --> 02:01:19,367
Show your mother my soap ad.

1196
02:01:19,642 --> 02:01:21,200
I'm looking nice in that one.

1197
02:01:26,916 --> 02:01:28,178
Come back quickly.

1198
02:01:29,919 --> 02:01:32,717
Next week, I'm in Goa for an ad shoot.

1199
02:01:33,189 --> 02:01:34,554
I'll be back in two or three days.

1200
02:01:35,324 --> 02:01:37,554
You're getting late... now go.

1201
02:01:42,598 --> 02:01:43,724
Go on.

1202
02:01:55,845 --> 02:02:05,811
BIGPictures

1203
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:45,720
How was it that you came to me

1204
02:02:46,929 --> 02:02:50,729
How blessed I am,
but it's hard to believe

1205
02:02:50,933 --> 02:02:54,733
You descended upon
life's placid lake...

1206
02:02:54,937 --> 02:03:00,671
like a rare Moon,

1207
02:03:00,877 --> 02:03:03,505
slowly,

1208
02:03:03,713 --> 02:03:06,341
gently

1209
02:03:09,385 --> 02:03:13,014
Under a winter's Sun,

1210
02:03:13,222 --> 02:03:16,191
like a warm melody...

1211
02:03:16,626 --> 02:03:19,459
you have caressed me,

1212
02:03:19,662 --> 02:03:27,797
I am enthralled

1213
02:03:28,037 --> 02:03:33,998
In you, my peace.
You are my passion

1214
02:03:34,243 --> 02:03:39,806
Why didn't I find you before?

1215
02:03:40,116 --> 02:03:50,151
How was it that you came to me...
how blessed I am, but it's hard to believe

1216
02:03:51,827 --> 02:03:53,556
That day, I swore...

1217
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:56,728
until I buy three Ambassador cars,

1218
02:03:56,933 --> 02:03:58,730
I won't marry.

1219
02:04:01,504 --> 02:04:04,337
Don't sell it.
It's an inheritance.

1220
02:04:05,274 --> 02:04:07,504
A car... I can buy again.

1221
02:04:13,783 --> 02:04:20,086
And once I believed,

1222
02:04:21,123 --> 02:04:23,751
that the Creator finds...

1223
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:26,190
His urge no more

1224
02:04:26,963 --> 02:04:27,429
And then...

1225
02:04:27,630 --> 02:04:32,590
He created you

1226
02:04:32,902 --> 02:04:39,102
And now He is revealed to me...

1227
02:04:39,308 --> 02:04:44,268
in all His glory

1228
02:04:55,825 --> 02:05:00,455
Chords of a music touch my life,

1229
02:05:01,664 --> 02:05:05,623
I can feel new tunes coming into life

1230
02:05:05,835 --> 02:05:15,540
But I still can't believe...

1231
02:05:15,745 --> 02:05:18,145
how blessed I am,

1232
02:05:18,347 --> 02:05:21,145
how you came to me...

1233
02:05:43,105 --> 02:05:44,037
I love you.

1234
02:05:53,482 --> 02:05:54,608
Come back quickly.

1235
02:06:28,784 --> 02:06:31,651
That's upto 21st June 2006.

1236
02:06:32,521 --> 02:06:35,888
Afterwards, Sanjay went to London
and Kalpana went to Goa.

1237
02:06:36,492 --> 02:06:37,720
What happened after that?

1238
02:06:58,681 --> 02:07:03,380
Anything more on the man
we arrested at the girls' hostel?

1239
02:07:03,586 --> 02:07:06,612
No, it's turning out to be a strange case.
- How come?

1240
02:07:09,392 --> 02:07:10,324
Bring him.

1241
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:15,092
It was tough keeping him under control,
so he was given a sedative.

1242
02:07:20,136 --> 02:07:23,105
He has several names
and numbers tattooed.

1243
02:07:23,305 --> 02:07:25,933
Also, several strange remarks.

1244
02:07:26,375 --> 02:07:27,103
On the head...

1245
02:07:27,410 --> 02:07:28,672
he has a deep scar.

1246
02:07:28,878 --> 02:07:29,606
Found on him...

1247
02:07:29,812 --> 02:07:32,940
a gun, a camera, photographs.

1248
02:07:33,249 --> 02:07:36,309
We haven't been able to
find out who he is.

1249
02:07:38,587 --> 02:07:41,351
Call up those numbers.
Find out who they are.

1250
02:07:57,540 --> 02:07:58,165
Hello?

1251
02:07:59,408 --> 02:08:02,275
Constable Dhuri from
D.N.Nagar Police station.

1252
02:08:19,662 --> 02:08:22,028
Do you recognise this man?

1253
02:08:29,972 --> 02:08:30,700
Yes.

1254
02:08:31,173 --> 02:08:33,733
He is Sanjay Singhania,
chairman of Air Voice.

1255
02:08:33,943 --> 02:08:36,309
The chairman of Air Voice?
- Yes.

1256
02:08:37,279 --> 02:08:39,304
He suffers from short term memory loss,

1257
02:08:39,548 --> 02:08:43,143
doesn't remember anything
beyond 15 minutes.

1258
02:08:43,853 --> 02:08:44,979
A friend of mine,

1259
02:08:45,855 --> 02:08:50,656
he has tattooed in my name and
number, for remembering me.

1260
02:08:53,229 --> 02:08:54,161
That's all.

1261
02:08:55,097 --> 02:08:56,223
Where did you find him?

1262
02:08:56,532 --> 02:08:59,990
Medical college girl's hostel. In a lift.

1263
02:09:00,469 --> 02:09:02,767
Sir, his manager and
his secretary are here.

1264
02:09:03,205 --> 02:09:05,901
Have you written a complaint about him?
- Not yet, sir.

1265
02:09:07,209 --> 02:09:08,176
Wait a while.

1266
02:09:08,477 --> 02:09:09,671
He's only a patient.

1267
02:09:10,446 --> 02:09:12,004
And do you know who he is?

1268
02:09:12,648 --> 02:09:14,775
He was found in a girls' hostel
with a gun.

1269
02:09:14,984 --> 02:09:16,576
How is one to take him
for a medical patient?

1270
02:09:16,785 --> 02:09:18,844
The gun is for his safety.

1271
02:09:19,822 --> 02:09:21,187
Here's the gun licence.

1272
02:09:22,491 --> 02:09:24,220
He didn't shoot at anyone, did he?

1273
02:09:25,961 --> 02:09:27,553
No complaint has been registered.

1274
02:09:27,830 --> 02:09:29,195
You can take him away.

1275
02:09:29,732 --> 02:09:32,030
But from now on, be careful.

1276
02:09:32,401 --> 02:09:34,596
Please take their contact details.

1277
02:09:35,137 --> 02:09:36,900
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1278
02:09:37,039 --> 02:09:38,028
Careful.

1279
02:10:15,544 --> 02:10:16,909
Sorry, you aren't allowed...
- Who are you?

1280
02:10:17,112 --> 02:10:19,137
Move over.
- Whom do you want?

1281
02:10:19,348 --> 02:10:20,406
Silence!

1282
02:10:20,616 --> 02:10:21,913
Why are you locking us?

1283
02:10:25,354 --> 02:10:29,984
171, Cheetah Camp. Deonar

1284
02:10:30,526 --> 02:10:32,994
13.06.2008

1285
02:10:33,629 --> 02:10:34,561
Whose address is it?

1286
02:10:34,763 --> 02:10:35,923
Mine.

1287
02:10:36,632 --> 02:10:40,534
The date is tomorrow's.
One day on, you'd be gone.

1288
02:10:41,870 --> 02:10:43,394
Don't shoot him!

1289
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:48,532
My name and number are on his body.

1290
02:10:49,378 --> 02:10:51,346
In police records,
he's a friend of mine.

1291
02:10:51,914 --> 02:10:56,146
A murder enquiry can
become big trouble.

1292
02:10:56,352 --> 02:10:59,583
You mean, we leave him alive?
- Yes, alive.

1293
02:11:00,923 --> 02:11:02,447
But like the living dead.

1294
02:11:03,158 --> 02:11:06,457
He's got memory tags everywhere.

1295
02:11:07,329 --> 02:11:09,695
We've got to erase what he has written,

1296
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,299
we got to turn him into blank paper.

1297
02:12:23,072 --> 02:12:26,701
Now, he's just like any other furniture

1298
02:12:27,810 --> 02:12:29,835
Just like a vegetable.

1299
02:12:45,728 --> 02:12:48,253
Newspaper archives?
- First floor.

1300
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:33,227
Why are you hiding?

1301
02:14:33,702 --> 02:14:34,760
Come out.

1302
02:14:35,771 --> 02:14:39,207
Come... careful.

1303
02:14:40,542 --> 02:14:41,338
Sit.

1304
02:14:43,045 --> 02:14:44,103
What happened to you?

1305
02:14:44,813 --> 02:14:47,509
I'm from Latur village.

1306
02:14:47,716 --> 02:14:53,177
Ramesh brought me to Mumbai,
saying he'd find a job for me.

1307
02:14:53,388 --> 02:14:57,290
But he sold me to someone.

1308
02:14:58,393 --> 02:15:04,025
Now... he's forcing me to go to Goa.

1309
02:15:04,566 --> 02:15:09,367
And... there are more girls like me
in a bogey up ahead.

1310
02:15:09,571 --> 02:15:14,440
At one of the stations, I managed to
get away and I'm hiding here.

1311
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:18,209
Don't cry. Nothing is going to happen.
I'm here with you.

1312
02:15:23,685 --> 02:15:24,549
She must be around.

1313
02:15:24,887 --> 02:15:26,013
Hurry up.

1314
02:15:26,822 --> 02:15:27,379
Move in.

1315
02:15:29,358 --> 02:15:30,052
Look behind.

1316
02:15:35,530 --> 02:15:38,499
Did you see a girl, wearing a frock?

1317
02:15:38,934 --> 02:15:40,026
Give me ten Rupees.

1318
02:15:41,603 --> 02:15:42,399
Here.

1319
02:15:46,775 --> 02:15:50,575
Open the door.
- Open up!

1320
02:15:50,779 --> 02:15:52,007
Give that girl to me!

1321
02:15:52,614 --> 02:15:54,275
I paid 2000 Rupees to buy her!

1322
02:15:54,483 --> 02:15:55,848
Come on, open up!

1323
02:15:56,051 --> 02:15:57,746
Open the door!

1324
02:16:01,957 --> 02:16:03,857
Open it!

1325
02:16:08,230 --> 02:16:09,527
It's gold!

1326
02:16:09,965 --> 02:16:11,159
Should be worth 3,000.

1327
02:16:12,267 --> 02:16:14,064
Forget the girl. Let's go.

1328
02:16:16,338 --> 02:16:17,327
It's all right.

1329
02:16:41,863 --> 02:16:42,795
Don't be afraid.

1330
02:16:42,998 --> 02:16:45,364
We'll get down at the next station
and we'll go to Bombay.

1331
02:16:54,376 --> 02:16:56,776
We've been after chickens.

1332
02:16:57,412 --> 02:16:59,209
Will we spare a hen if we find one?

1333
02:17:02,784 --> 02:17:05,514
Let go... leave her!

1334
02:17:07,255 --> 02:17:09,086
Sister...

1335
02:17:11,193 --> 02:17:13,753
Help me!

1336
02:17:13,962 --> 02:17:14,223
Leave me!

1337
02:17:14,429 --> 02:17:15,862
How far can she run?

1338
02:17:16,231 --> 02:17:19,064
Sister, do something!

1339
02:17:19,267 --> 02:17:21,098
Look at her... there.

1340
02:17:21,303 --> 02:17:25,831
Sister! Help me!

1341
02:18:32,007 --> 02:18:33,497
Hi, how are you?

1342
02:18:33,708 --> 02:18:35,573
I'm okay. Are you in Goa?

1343
02:18:35,944 --> 02:18:38,003
No, I'm returning to Mumbai.

1344
02:18:38,213 --> 02:18:38,872
What?

1345
02:18:39,081 --> 02:18:40,708
It's a long story.

1346
02:18:40,916 --> 02:18:44,750
In my train, there were some goons.
They were taking 25 kidnapped girls to Goa.

1347
02:18:45,353 --> 02:18:46,786
Somehow, I managed to save them.

1348
02:18:46,988 --> 02:18:49,479
I'm on my way back
to Mumbai with them.

1349
02:18:49,791 --> 02:18:51,918
What! Are you all right?

1350
02:18:52,127 --> 02:18:53,458
Tell me about it, what happened?

1351
02:18:53,795 --> 02:18:55,422
Don't worry, nothing's happened to me.

1352
02:18:55,630 --> 02:18:56,597
Are you sure?

1353
02:18:56,798 --> 02:18:59,824
I'm perfectly all right, really.

1354
02:19:00,535 --> 02:19:01,832
You're too much, Kalpana.

1355
02:19:04,139 --> 02:19:06,699
But it's also what I like the
most about you.

1356
02:19:07,142 --> 02:19:08,234
What...?

1357
02:19:08,443 --> 02:19:09,808
This habit of helping others.

1358
02:19:10,545 --> 02:19:12,274
The first time I saw you,

1359
02:19:12,481 --> 02:19:17,077
you were helping some
disabled girls across a ditch.

1360
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:19,514
How do you know that?

1361
02:19:21,156 --> 02:19:23,386
There's so much I haven't told you.

1362
02:19:24,292 --> 02:19:25,782
Stuff you'll be amazed to hear.

1363
02:19:25,994 --> 02:19:28,121
Drop the melodrama and tell me.

1364
02:19:28,730 --> 02:19:31,756
Not like this...
when I'm saying it,

1365
02:19:31,967 --> 02:19:33,798
I got to see the look on your face.

1366
02:19:34,736 --> 02:19:36,203
So, I'll tell it to you once I'm back.

1367
02:19:36,538 --> 02:19:37,505
See you.

1368
02:19:37,706 --> 02:19:38,730
Take care, bye.

1369
02:19:39,908 --> 02:19:40,772
Bye.

1370
02:19:52,254 --> 02:19:57,351
The biggest news is about kidnapped girls,
trafficking in human organs and flesh trade.

1371
02:19:57,559 --> 02:20:00,926
Last night's revelation has
stunned everyone.

1372
02:20:01,129 --> 02:20:05,498
25 girls from villages in North India lured to
the city on the pretext of giving jobs...

1373
02:20:05,700 --> 02:20:11,297
were being taken from Mumbai to Goa.
With the help of some soldiers,

1374
02:20:11,606 --> 02:20:13,437
Kalpana rescued them.

1375
02:20:13,608 --> 02:20:17,908
Investigations reveal that organs have already
been harvested from these girls.

1376
02:20:18,113 --> 02:20:21,947
Several girls have been operated surgically
and their kidneys have been removed.

1377
02:20:22,150 --> 02:20:27,452
Now they were en route to Goa,
to be pressed into the flesh trade.

1378
02:20:27,789 --> 02:20:31,486
It's apparently a full-fledged racket,
flourishing right across the country.

1379
02:20:31,693 --> 02:20:36,460
Investigations indicate the possible
involvement of influential people.

1380
02:20:36,798 --> 02:20:39,528
Information given by the rescued girls has
led to a country-wide crackdown.

1381
02:20:39,734 --> 02:20:43,761
Several suspects are
being questioned.

1382
02:20:43,972 --> 02:20:49,808
Most of them are women and young girls,
more than half of whom are children.

1383
02:21:00,789 --> 02:21:01,653
Hello

1384
02:21:01,723 --> 02:21:05,420
I'm Constable Vyjayanti.
From Bombay Municipal Hospital.

1385
02:21:05,627 --> 02:21:07,822
Yes, go on.

1386
02:21:07,929 --> 02:21:12,195
Look, you sent 25 girls...?
- Yes?

1387
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:16,564
Two are missing, without a trace.

1388
02:21:17,105 --> 02:21:19,039
Please come over here
and check them out.

1389
02:21:19,574 --> 02:21:22,236
Please do not mention
that I've tipped you.

1390
02:21:22,444 --> 02:21:24,571
Some very influential people
are behind it.

1391
02:21:40,328 --> 02:21:42,387
Madam... here...?
At this hour?

1392
02:21:42,597 --> 02:21:43,621
Please come in the morning.

1393
02:21:43,832 --> 02:21:45,823
The girls will be let off tomorrow morning.

1394
02:21:46,034 --> 02:21:47,524
I had brought 25 girls.

1395
02:21:47,736 --> 02:21:48,862
There are only 23 here.

1396
02:21:49,070 --> 02:21:50,697
Where are the two girls?

1397
02:21:51,306 --> 02:21:52,864
You are mistaken.

1398
02:21:53,074 --> 02:21:54,336
You brought 23.

1399
02:21:54,542 --> 02:21:56,100
Don't you lie!

1400
02:21:56,244 --> 02:21:58,804
I have a list, of names.

1401
02:22:10,091 --> 02:22:11,023
Good evening, sir.

1402
02:22:14,562 --> 02:22:16,029
Yes.

1403
02:22:16,231 --> 02:22:18,222
You brought in 25 girls.

1404
02:22:19,067 --> 02:22:19,624
Who are you?

1405
02:22:19,834 --> 02:22:20,926
Ghajini.

1406
02:22:21,369 --> 02:22:22,700
Ghajini Dharmatma.

1407
02:22:24,072 --> 02:22:29,305
23 out of 25 named my men.
I'd let it pass.

1408
02:22:30,078 --> 02:22:33,343
But these two, pointed fingers at me.

1409
02:22:35,183 --> 02:22:36,878
Where are the two girls?

1410
02:22:37,118 --> 02:22:39,780
Dead and dumped in the sea.

1411
02:22:41,990 --> 02:22:44,083
Are you asking to know more?

1412
02:22:48,897 --> 02:22:50,797
Because of beasts like you,

1413
02:22:50,999 --> 02:22:53,331
girls are afraid to step out
of their homes.

1414
02:22:57,939 --> 02:23:00,703
Of how many apparitions of men,
should women beware?

1415
02:23:01,943 --> 02:23:03,934
Of keepers of faith and religion?

1416
02:23:04,713 --> 02:23:05,702
Of doctors?

1417
02:23:06,348 --> 02:23:09,408
At work places, in schools, colleges?

1418
02:23:25,667 --> 02:23:26,497
Hello

1419
02:23:46,855 --> 02:23:49,483
Dead and dumped in the sea.

1420
02:24:03,805 --> 02:24:04,271
Hello?

1421
02:24:04,472 --> 02:24:07,498
Vyjayanti speaking...

1422
02:24:07,709 --> 02:24:08,698
Go on.

1423
02:24:08,910 --> 02:24:11,674
They're planning to kill you.

1424
02:24:13,848 --> 02:24:15,748
Please do not go home.

1425
02:24:16,217 --> 02:24:17,445
Go elsewhere.

1426
02:24:18,153 --> 02:24:19,620
They're hiding inside your house.

1427
02:24:55,356 --> 02:24:58,848
What happened?
- A power failure... hold it.

1428
02:25:16,978 --> 02:25:19,469
The door is locked from inside.
She's in here.

1429
02:25:22,851 --> 02:25:23,909
Find her.

1430
02:26:33,788 --> 02:26:34,755
Kalpana...?

1431
02:26:43,131 --> 02:26:44,257
Kalpana

1432
02:27:13,428 --> 02:27:14,395
Kalpana

1433
02:27:30,511 --> 02:27:33,207
Don't go away... don't!

1434
02:28:02,310 --> 02:28:02,935
Fast.

1435
02:28:39,714 --> 02:28:40,305
Hey!

1436
02:28:42,050 --> 02:28:42,846
Look!

1437
02:28:47,922 --> 02:28:49,014
What's it?

1438
02:28:49,424 --> 02:28:50,755
She must've gone that way.

1439
02:28:50,958 --> 02:28:51,822
Go.

1440
02:29:37,538 --> 02:29:38,095
Hello?

1441
02:29:38,306 --> 02:29:40,331
Hello Kalpana... Kalpana...

1442
02:30:14,842 --> 02:30:15,809
Kalpana

1443
02:30:21,682 --> 02:30:22,649
Kalpana

BIGPictures

1445
02:30:48,209 --> 02:30:49,176
Go away, Sachin.

1446
02:30:51,646 --> 02:30:52,078
Get out.

1447
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:53,679
Kalpana... what...?

1448
02:30:56,717 --> 02:30:57,911
What happened...?

1449
02:31:04,058 --> 02:31:04,990
Ghajini

1450
02:31:10,731 --> 02:31:11,857
Ghajini

1451
02:31:26,247 --> 02:31:27,214
Kalpana!

1452
02:31:27,748 --> 02:31:28,578
Kalpana...

1453
02:32:23,137 --> 02:32:24,195
Kalpana

1454
02:32:56,103 --> 02:32:57,695
No!

1455
02:34:41,909 --> 02:34:46,073
I'm Sunita. I'm a medical student.

1456
02:36:28,115 --> 02:36:29,241
Forgive me.

1457
02:36:29,450 --> 02:36:31,213
Even I'm responsible for
the state you're in.

1458
02:36:31,418 --> 02:36:33,443
I'll take you to Ghajini.

1459
02:36:33,654 --> 02:36:34,985
I'll bring back your memories.

1460
02:36:35,189 --> 02:36:37,487
I got to talk to him! Now!

1461
02:36:44,532 --> 02:36:46,830
Hello... hello?

1462
02:36:47,034 --> 02:36:48,831
My name is Sanjay.

1463
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:49,998
What?

1464
02:36:50,437 --> 02:36:52,064
Sanjay Singhania.

1465
02:36:53,107 --> 02:36:54,734
Your name is Ghajini.

1466
02:36:56,343 --> 02:36:58,607
Do you remember the first of July, 2006?

1467
02:37:00,181 --> 02:37:03,378
You may forget, but I cannot forget.

1468
02:37:04,051 --> 02:37:05,609
It's the only thing I remember.

1469
02:37:06,987 --> 02:37:09,581
Leaving you alive was a mistake.

1470
02:37:10,424 --> 02:37:14,861
But now, I'll finish you off.

1471
02:37:15,062 --> 02:37:16,791
This time, no sparing you.

1472
02:37:16,997 --> 02:37:19,966
Wait for your death. I'm coming.

1473
02:37:21,202 --> 02:37:22,726
Damn you!

1474
02:37:24,538 --> 02:37:30,272
Damn... a short-term memory-loss
patient is reminding me?

1475
02:37:33,480 --> 02:37:36,916
Get the cars.
We're going into my den.

1476
02:37:37,418 --> 02:37:39,045
Let him come to my area.

1477
02:37:40,721 --> 02:37:43,053
After I'm through,

1478
02:37:43,757 --> 02:37:45,987
they won't find even a fingernail on him.

1479
02:38:01,175 --> 02:38:02,437
They're going somewhere.

1480
02:38:02,910 --> 02:38:03,899
Follow them.

1481
02:38:44,084 --> 02:38:45,415
They're stopping here.

1482
02:38:45,619 --> 02:38:47,052
Which one is Ghajini?

1483
02:38:48,389 --> 02:38:49,856
The man in white.

1484
02:39:02,369 --> 02:39:04,132
This looks like a dangerous area.

1485
02:39:04,338 --> 02:39:06,203
I think we shouldn't wait here.

1486
02:39:10,644 --> 02:39:12,044
Where are you going?

1487
02:39:12,079 --> 02:39:13,137
You can't kill him so easily.

1488
02:39:13,347 --> 02:39:14,609
There are too many of them in there.

1489
02:39:14,815 --> 02:39:16,646
Stop! We'll get him when he's alone.

1490
02:39:16,850 --> 02:39:18,010
This is a very dangerous area.

1491
02:39:18,218 --> 02:39:19,583
Have you gone mad?

1492
02:39:23,524 --> 02:39:24,320
Oh God!

1493
02:39:40,708 --> 02:39:49,741
Hey stop... Where are you going?
Entry is barred

1494
02:40:38,432 --> 02:40:40,059
He's here! Tell the boss.

1495
02:40:54,681 --> 02:40:55,705
He's coming!

1496
02:40:56,784 --> 02:40:57,773
Move it...

1497
02:40:57,985 --> 02:40:59,350
let's get him!

1498
02:40:59,553 --> 02:41:01,885
Don't let him get away!
- Get the irons...

1499
02:41:02,089 --> 02:41:03,522
He won't get away!
- Don't let him in.

1500
02:42:38,685 --> 02:42:40,209
Boss...

1501
02:43:01,008 --> 02:43:05,502
Now you're gone... finished!

1502
02:48:55,762 --> 02:48:56,592
Brother...

1503
02:48:57,130 --> 02:48:59,598
help me... save me!

1504
02:48:59,966 --> 02:49:02,127
Ghajini is coming... that way!

1505
02:49:02,335 --> 02:49:03,359
Please, help me!

1506
02:49:03,970 --> 02:49:05,096
I'm Prakash!

1507
02:49:05,305 --> 02:49:06,135
Have you forgotten?

1508
02:49:06,306 --> 02:49:07,637
We came for Ghajini!

1509
02:49:07,841 --> 02:49:09,103
Look at how badly he has bruised me!

1510
02:49:09,309 --> 02:49:12,335
I'm Prakash...
Ghajini did this to me.

1511
02:49:13,647 --> 02:49:14,614
He hit me so badly.

1512
02:49:14,814 --> 02:49:16,577
He's a very dangerous man!

1513
02:49:17,484 --> 02:49:19,008
Very dangerous!

1514
02:49:19,252 --> 02:49:20,480
He's coming that way.

1515
02:49:21,154 --> 02:49:22,553
Keep an eye out for him.

1516
02:49:23,523 --> 02:49:24,683
Keep an eye on him.

1517
02:49:25,258 --> 02:49:25,986
Watch out

1518
02:49:26,826 --> 02:49:30,455
Cunning man... very cunning man.

1519
02:49:36,803 --> 02:49:38,464
Got you!

1520
02:50:01,962 --> 02:50:03,156
Got you!

1521
02:50:03,697 --> 02:50:05,927
Short term memory loss...

1522
02:50:07,367 --> 02:50:09,528
Look at my face.

1523
02:50:10,370 --> 02:50:11,598
Look.

1524
02:50:11,705 --> 02:50:13,502
I am Ghajini.

1525
02:50:13,840 --> 02:50:14,829
I am.

1526
02:50:15,342 --> 02:50:18,140
I am the one you wanted to kill.

1527
02:50:18,345 --> 02:50:19,471
Do you remember why?

1528
02:50:26,619 --> 02:50:29,019
Your memory is too weak,

1529
02:50:29,756 --> 02:50:31,815
lasts you for just 15 minutes.

1530
02:50:32,625 --> 02:50:33,683
But have no regrets.

1531
02:50:35,595 --> 02:50:42,967
In these final 15 minutes of your life,
I'll give the action replay, over again.

1532
02:50:54,314 --> 02:50:55,747
Remember the rod...?

1533
02:50:57,150 --> 02:50:59,744
The one that I used to kill your fiancee?

1534
02:51:01,755 --> 02:51:02,949
Somewhat like this one...

1535
02:51:04,491 --> 02:51:05,719
it comes to your mind?

1536
02:51:11,564 --> 02:51:14,965
I killed her right in front of your eyes.

1537
02:51:22,042 --> 02:51:24,237
Before I kill you,

1538
02:51:24,444 --> 02:51:29,780
I'll show you exactly
how I killed your Kalpana.

1539
02:51:31,618 --> 02:51:32,482
Watch this.

1540
02:55:55,882 --> 02:55:57,577
Kalpana Home for Orphans

1541
02:56:23,843 --> 02:56:27,108
Let's go cut the cake.
- Yes... let's all go.

1542
02:56:31,150 --> 02:56:33,209
Time to cut your cake.

1543
02:56:34,821 --> 02:56:36,618
Wait!

1544
02:56:37,690 --> 02:56:40,022
Sanjay, what's her name?

1545
02:56:42,729 --> 02:56:43,923
Rahul... no.

1546
02:56:49,669 --> 02:56:50,567
Pooja.

1547
02:56:52,605 --> 02:56:53,970
You read it here!

1548
02:56:54,173 --> 02:56:56,141
Cheater... cheater...

1549
02:56:56,342 --> 02:57:08,550
Happy birthday to you.

1550

BIGPictures

1551
02:58:53,159 --> 02:58:55,787
Pathways, streams and rivers all change

1552
02:58:55,995 --> 02:58:58,657
Glimmering lamps cast lights of change

1553
02:58:58,865 --> 02:59:01,698
When the change strikes life's rhythm

1554
02:59:01,901 --> 02:59:04,631
The rhythm of the rain will also change

1555
02:59:04,837 --> 02:59:10,207
And the nature of seasons will change

1556
02:59:10,776 --> 02:59:14,712
But I shall forever be...

1557
02:59:14,914 --> 02:59:18,714
the same to you as I've been

1558
02:59:18,918 --> 02:59:24,481
Arm in arm, with you my mate,

1559
02:59:24,690 --> 02:59:27,386
every moment,

1560
02:59:27,593 --> 02:59:29,618
always

1561
02:59:45,912 --> 02:59:50,406
How was it that you came to me

1562
02:59:51,751 --> 02:59:55,517
How blessed I was,
but it's hard to believe

1563
02:59:55,721 --> 02:59:59,521
You descended upon
life's placid lake...

1564
02:59:59,725 --> 03:00:05,425
like a rare Moon,

1565
03:00:05,631 --> 03:00:08,293
slowly,

1566
03:00:08,501 --> 03:00:10,765
gently

1567
03:00:14,206 --> 03:00:17,664
Under winter's Suns,

1568
03:00:17,877 --> 03:00:20,710
like a warm melody...

1569
03:00:21,314 --> 03:00:26,911
you caressed me, now you're gone

1570
03:00:27,320 --> 03:00:32,587
But I still live, enthralled

1571
03:00:33,059 --> 03:00:38,793
In you, my peace.
You are my passion

1572
03:00:38,998 --> 03:00:44,436
Why didn't I find you before?

1573
03:00:44,503 --> 03:00:55,072
How was it that you came to me...
how blessed I was, but it's hard to believe

1574
03:02:50,763 --> 03:02:57,100
And once I believed,

1575
03:02:58,170 --> 03:03:03,073
that the Creator finds
His urge no more

1576
03:03:03,909 --> 03:03:09,211
And then He created you...

1577
03:03:09,882 --> 03:03:15,445
for me to sing...

1578
03:03:15,654 --> 03:03:20,956
eulogies to His glory
