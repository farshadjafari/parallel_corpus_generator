It's a lot of water.

-You okay, boss?
-Yeah, I'm fine, I just...

10
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,749
I just can't... Can't stomach the water.

11
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,922
-You're my new partner.
-That's right.

12
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,009
Not the best way to meet,
with my head halfway down the toilet.

13
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,138
Doesn't exactly square with
"Teddy Daniels, the man, the legend,"

-I'll give you that.
-The legend?

What the hell you boys smoking
over there in Portland, anyway?

00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,896
Seattle. I came from
the office in Seattle.

17
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,776
How long you been with the Marshals?

18
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,278
Four years.

19
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,198
So you know how small it is.

20
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,700
Sure.

21
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,704
What about you?
You got a girl? Married?

22
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,789
I was.

-Jesus. I don't...
-Don't worry about it.

27
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,853
There was a fire at the apartment
building while I was at work.

28
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,646
Four people died.

29
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,567
It was the smoke that got her,
not the fire. See, that's important.

30
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,360
I'm sorry, boss.

Oh, here, have one of mine.

I could've sworn they were
in my jacket before I got on.

Government employees
will rob you blind.

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,459
Thanks.

36
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,254
They give you a briefing about
the institution before you left?

37
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,007
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

38

Well, if it's just folks running
around hearing voices

41
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,683
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

42
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,695
-Is that where we're headed?
-Yep.

is rock bluffs

We'll be casting off
as soon as you two are ashore.

I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry up about it.

-Why?
-Storm's coming.

I'm Deputy Warden McPherson,
gentlemen.

Welcome to Shutter Island.

52
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,293
I'll be the one taking you
up to Ashecliffe.

53
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,474
Your boys seem a little on edge,
Mr. McPherson.

54
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,935
Right now, Marshal, we all are.

How can you tell?

57
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,738
I've seen something like it before.

58
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:37,187
All right. You gentlemen will be accorded
all the help we can give,

59
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,232
but during your stay,
you will obey protocol.

60
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,691
Is that understood?

61
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,151
Absolutely.

62
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,947
The red brick building on your right
is Ward A, the male ward.

63
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,409
Ward B, the female ward,
is the one on your left.

64
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,453
Ward C is that building on the bluffs.

65
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,122
An old Civil War fort.

66
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,624
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

67
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,626
Admittance to Ward C is forbidden

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,379

and physical presence

69
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,006
of both myself and Dr. Cawley.

00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,883
Is that understood?

71
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,262
You act like insanity is catching.

72
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,393
You are hereby required
to surrender your firearms.

73
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,273
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

74
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,859
We are required to carry our firearms
with us at all times.

75
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,945
Executive order 31 9
of the Federal Code of Penitentiaries

76
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,072
states that when inside a penitentiary,

77
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,576
the officers of that institution
have final authority.

78
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,458
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

79
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,189
Okay. Now that the official stuff's done,
come on, boys,

80
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,232
what do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

81
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,955
When did she escape? This prisoner?

82
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,210
I'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have
to fill you in on the situation. Protocol.

at a mental institution,

00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,672

of its kind in the U.S., even the world.

We take only the most dangerous,
damaged patients,

00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,847
ones no other hospital can manage.

88
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,849
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

89
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,851
He's created something
really unique here.

90
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,522
It's a hospital for people our society
normally considers beyond treatment.

-MI5, the OSS...
-Why?

What do you mean?

What do intelligence agencies
want to consult a psychiatrist about?

Thank you, Deputy Warden.
That will be all.

Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen.

00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,346
He had a lot to say about you.

106
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,641
McPherson's a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

107
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,019
And what would that be, exactly?

108
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,772
A moral fusion between law and order
and clinical care.

A what between what and what?

Used to be the kind of patients
we deal with here

were shackled and left in their own filth.

113
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,500
They were beaten,

114
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,836
as if whipping them bloody
would drive the psychosis out.

115
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,005
We drove screws into their brains,

116
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,925
we submerged them in icy water
until they lost consciousness

117
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,470
or even drowned.

118
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,513
-And now?
-We treat them.

119

Try to heal, try to cure.

120
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,517
And if that fails,
at least we provide them

121
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,854
with a measure of comfort
in their lives. Calm.

122

-Murdered them in some cases.
-In almost all cases, yes.

125
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,949
Then, personally, Doctor,
I'd have to say,

126
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,410
screw their sense of calm.

127
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,749
It's my job to treat my patients,
not their victims. I'm not here to judge.

-Last night between 10:00 and midnight.
-Is she considered dangerous?

00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,101
You could say that.
She killed all three of her children.

133
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,896
She drowned them in the lake
behind her house.

134
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,274
She took them out one by one,
held their heads under till they died,

135
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,236
then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

136
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,656
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

137
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,742
And what about the husband?

138
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,538
He died on the beaches of Normandy.
She's a war widow.

139
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,582
She starved herself
when she first came here.

140
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,502
She insisted the children weren't dead.

to have an aspirin, do you?

-Prone to headaches, Marshal?
-Sometimes. But today,

-I'm a little more prone to seasickness.
-Ah, dehydration.

-You all right, boss?
-Yeah.

146
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,651
In that case, you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

147
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,278
Thanks so much.

148
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,157
Rachel still believes
the children are alive.

149
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,702
She also believes
this place is her home in the Berkshires.

(CHUCKLES)

151
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,081
-You're kidding me.
-She's never once in two years

152
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,833
acknowledged that she's
in an institution.

153
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,795
She believes we're all deliverymen,
milkmen, postal workers.

154
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,089
To sustain the delusion
that her children never died,

155
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,175
she's created
an elaborate fictional structure,

156
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,636
and she gives us all
parts to play in that fiction.

157
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,639
So have you searched the grounds yet?

158
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,309
The warden and his men
scoured the island.

159
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,894
Not a trace.

160
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:56,024
And what's more disturbing is we don't
know how she got out of her room.

161
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,903
It was locked from the outside,
and the only window is barred.

162
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,201
It's as if she evaporated
straight through the walls.

163
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,919
I brought her right back here
after group therapy, locked her in,

164
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,005
came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

165
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,016
Seriously, Doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

166
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,019
I mean,
she's in a mental institution, right?

167
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,104
Seems like something you'd notice
from time to time.

168
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,357
How many pairs of shoes
are the patients given?

169
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,817
Two pairs.

Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.
You can't just choose to get over it.

171
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,116
So, she left here barefoot?

172

Oh, I don't know, Doctor. You tell us.

Dr. Naehring acts as liaison
to our Board of Overseers.

357
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,514
He relayed your request,
and it's been refused.

358
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,934
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse, and neither do you, sir.

359
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,729
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we'll do all we can to help.

This investigation is over.

and we're gonna hand it over to...

-Hoover's boys. That's right.

We'll be taking the ferry back
in the morning. Come on, Chuck.

Why?

I guess... I don't know,
I just never really quit anything before.

We haven't heard the truth
once yet, Chuck.

370
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:05,289
Listen, Rachel Solando didn't slip out
of a locked cell, barefoot,

371
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,582
without any help.

372
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,668
I think she had a lot of help.

in his mansion right now

-Maybe, in the morning, we'll be...
-You're bluffing?

00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,302
No.

00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,312
Rachel?

387
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,190
She never left.

388
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:30,708
Remember when we stayed in the cabin
in the summer, Teddy?

389
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,210
We were so happy.

390
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,047
She's here.

Well, it's not like we could take the ferry.

become reasonable, docile.

was her refusal
to face what she had done.

-It was obvious.

00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:17,215
She believed her kids were alive.

516
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,343
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires,

517
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:25,390
and we were all her neighbors,
the milkmen, postmen...

518
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,017
Deliverymen.

519
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,645
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

520
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,316
Yes. He talked about anger.

521
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,280
Tell me about him. What's he like?

522
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,783
Uh, he's, uh...

523
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,163
Okay. Nice.

524
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,958
Not hard on the eyes,
as my mother would say.

525
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,794
(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)

526
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,215
-Did he ever make a pass at you?
-No.

527
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,677
No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor,
he would never...

528
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,388
Um...

529
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,350
(STAMMERING) Could I have
a glass of water, please?

530
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,851
No problem.

531
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,035
-Thank you, Marshal.
-CHUCK: Sure.

532
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,125
TEDDY: I just have one more question
for you, Mrs. Kearns.

533
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,674
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

534
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,928
No.

535
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,973
(VOICE BREAKING) Never heard of him.

536
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,063
TEDDY: She was coached.

537
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,233
She used practically the same words
as Cawley and the nurse,

538
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,736
-like she'd been told exactly what to say.
-Who's Andrew Laeddis?

539
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:10,662
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

540

(SIGHS)

541
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,961
What the hell, boss?
I'm your partner, for Christ's sake.

542
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,921
We just met, Chuck.

543
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,925
You've been on the beat for a long time.
You've got a duty. You've got a career.

544
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,430
What I'm doing,
it's not exactly by the book.

545
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,642
I don't give a damn
about by-the-book, boss.

546
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,603
I just wanna know
what the hell's going on.

547
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,485
When this case came over the wires,

548
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,364
I requested it specifically,
you understand?

549
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,991
Why?

550
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,953
Andrew Laeddis,

551
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,956
he was the maintenance man
in the apartment building

552
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,208
where my wife and I lived.

553
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,502
Okay.

554
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,381
He was also a firebug.

555
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,803
Andrew Laeddis lit the match

556
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,476
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

557
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,152
GUARD: Let them out!

558
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:30,158
CHUCK: What happened to Laeddis?
TEDDY: He got away with it.

559
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,660
Laeddis got away with it
and then he disappeared.

560
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,747
About a year ago, I open up the paper
and there he is.

561
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:40,335
Ugly-looking son of a bitch. Huge scar
from his right temple down to his left lip.

562
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,880
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you'd forget.

563
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,092
He burned down a schoolhouse,
killed two people,

564
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,927
said voices told him to do it.

565
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,638
First he went to prison,
then he got transferred here.

566
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,932
-Then what?
-Then nothing.

567
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:57,769
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

568
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,230
Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.
That leaves Ward C.

569
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,606
Or he could be dead.

570
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,275
So could Rachel Solando,
for that matter.

571
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,945
Lot of places to hide a body here.

572
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,657
Only one place
no one would really notice.

573
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:26,297
That patient, Bridget Kearns,
when she sent me for water,

574
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,300
she said something to you back there,
didn't she?

575
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,510
No.

576
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,721
Come on, boss.

577
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,144
She wrote it.

578
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:59,664
Boss! We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into a fucking Kansas out here.

579
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,000
-Hold on.
-No, let's go!

580
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,337
Watch out!

-You okay, boss?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

589
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,679
So if Laeddis is here,

590
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,141
-what are you gonna do about it?
-Mmm.

591
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,187
I'm not here to kill Laeddis.

592
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,697
If it was my wife, I'd kill him. Twice.

593
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:30,088
TEDDY: When we got through the gates
at Dachau, the SS guards surrendered.

594
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:44,352
The Kommandant tried to kill himself
before we got there, but he...

595
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,813
He botched it.

596
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,358
Took him an hour to die.

597
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:59,200
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

598
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,373
Too many to count.

599
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,901
Too many to imagine.

600
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,239
So, yeah, the...

601
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,327
The guards surrendered,
we took their guns,

602
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,329
and we lined them up.

It was murder.

After Laeddis vanished, I started doing
some checking on Ashecliffe.

A lot of people know about this place,
but no one wants to talk.

You know, it's like it...

615
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,867
It's like they're scared or something.

00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,914
You know, this place is funded

Un-American Activities Committee?

are we fighting the communists

619

from an island in Boston Harbor?

At least that's my guess.

622
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,265
And you think that's going on here?

Like I said, no one would talk, right?

624
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,603
Till I found somebody
who used to be a patient here.

625
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:37,066
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid. Socialist.

626
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,193
He gets offered some money
to do a psych study.

627
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,653
Guess what they were testing?

628
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,821
Toothpaste.

629
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,282
So, he starts
seeing dragons everywhere.

630
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:49,370
He almost beats his professor to death.
Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C.

631
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:53,499
They release him after one year, right?
And what does he do?

632
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:58,504
Two weeks on the mainland, he walks
into a bar, stabs three men to death.

633

His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce,
he stands up in the courtroom and he...

634
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:08,556
He begs the judge for the electric chair.
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

-And you found him.
-Yeah, I found him.

637
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,191
Well, he's a mess.

638
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,903
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

639
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,112
What?

640
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,239
They're experimenting on people here.

-That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

Crazy people, they're the perfect
subjects. They talk, nobody listens.

I stood at Dachau.

00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:43,800
We saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

For Christ's sakes, we fought
a goddamn war to stop them,

and now... Now I find out it may be
happening here? On our soil? No.

So what are you really here to do, Ted?

649
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,732
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back,

650
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,068
and I'm gonna blow the lid off this place.

651
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,111
That's it.

652
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,405
Wait a minute.

653
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,784
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

654
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,285
waiting for a chance to get out here,

655
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,955
and then suddenly
they need a U.S. Marshal?

656
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:17,917
Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patient
escape. It was the perfect excuse.

657
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,003
No, no, no, boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

658
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,755
The world doesn't work that way.

659
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,133
They got an electrified fence
around a septic facility.

660
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,345
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

661
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:33,099
A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

662
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:37,770
I mean, Jesus Christ, everything about
this place stinks of government ops.

-What if they wanted you here?
-Bullshit.

664
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,066
-You were asking questions.
-Bullshit! Bullshit!

00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,651
Bullshit. We came here
for Rachel Solando.

666
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,612
Where's one shred of evidence
she even existed?

667
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,864
There's no way they could've known

668
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,323
I'd be assigned to this case.
There's no way.

669
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,743
What if while you were looking into
them, they were looking into you?

670
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:56,038
All they had to do was fake an escape
to get you here, and now they have you.

671
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,915
Now they have us both. Here! Now!

675
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,761
How about that? They found us, huh?

676
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,347
It's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

677
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,350
I know you're in there.

678
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,105
We're getting off this goddamn island.
You and me. Come on.

679
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,528
-Come on!
-Go, go!

680
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,458
McPHERSON: Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now.

681
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,629
And hurry up! This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

682
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:54,138
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
Should be ready by tomorrow.

683
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,016
That is, if we all don't wash away first.

684
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,562
You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid
your smokes are pretty much done for.

685
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,314
So...

686
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,109
This is our only choice, huh?

687
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:10,237
Got something really nice in
a prison gray if that don't work for you.

688
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,240
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

689
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,036
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all Ward C patients

690
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,372
be placed in manual restraints.

691
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,792
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

692
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,502
NAEHRING: That would take
a lot of flooding.

693
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,544
CAWLEY: We're on an island

694
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,254
in the middle of the ocean
during a hurricane.

695
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,007
A lot of flooding seems
like a distinct possibility.

696
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,426
DOCTOR 1: It's a gamble, Stephen.
Say the power fails.

697
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,761
There's a backup generator.

698
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,555
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

699
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,351
Where are they going to go? Mmm?

700
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,437
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

701
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,522
NAEHRING: Oh, you're quite right.

702
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,775
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

703
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,612
If they're manacled to the floor,
they'll die.

704
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,823
This is 24 human beings.

705
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,783
And you can live with that, can you?

706
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,954
Well, frankly, if it were up to me,
I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B

707
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,372
in manual restraints as well.

708
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,333
-Excuse me! Excuse me.
-CAWLEY: Marshal.

709
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,961
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I just have one quick question.

710
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,254
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.

711
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,340
When we spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note...

712
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,134
"The law of four." I love that.

713
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:16,762
...you said you had no idea what that
second line could refer to, correct?

714
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:22,184
"Who is 67?" Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

715
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,937
Uh-huh. Nothing comes to mind?

716
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,858
Nothing?

717
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:37,867
Because I believe I just heard you say
there are 24 patients in Ward C

718
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,411
and 42 patients in Wards A and B,

719
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,956
which means there's a total of,
what, 66 patients at this facility?

720
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,625
That is correct, yes.

721
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,506
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando was suggesting

722
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:56,385
that you have a 67th patient, Doctor.

723
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,388
But I'm afraid we don't.

724
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,932
(CHUCKLING) This is ridiculous.
What are they doing here?

725
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,185
We're doing our goddamn job.

726
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,188
Didn't McPherson tell you
the good news?

727
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,191
(SIGHS) No.
What's the good news, Doctor?

728
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,610
Rachel's been found.

729
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,029
She's here.

730
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,698
Safe and sound.

731
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,420
(SOFTLY) There's not a mark on her.

732

(WHISPERING)
Why are they in my house?

734
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:46,018
Police officers, Rachel.
They have a few questions.

735
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,731
Ma'am.

736
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:58,697
There has been a sighting of a known
communist subversive in this area,

737
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,699
passing out literature.

738
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,702
Here?

739
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,540
In this neighborhood?

740
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,375
Yes, I'm afraid so.

741
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:14,338
Now if you could tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

742
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,549
it would really help us
narrow down our search.

743
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,426
Yes, um...

744
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,514
Well, I, um...

745
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:29,270
I made breakfast
for Jim and the children,

746
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,356
and then I

747
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,443
packed Jim's lunch and he left.

748
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,783
Then I sent the children off to school.

749
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,455
And then

750
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,624
(CHUCKLES)

751
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,923
I decided to take a long swim
in the lake.

752
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,015

753
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,270
And after that?

754
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,526
(SNIFFS) Um...

755
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,779
After that,

756
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,208
I thought of you.

757
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:42,176

I don't know what you're talking about.

how lonely I've been, Jim?

759
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,189
You're gone.

760
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,903

768
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,614

CHUCK: Boss, we got problems.

1026
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:39,302
McPherson and Cawley
are in the building.

1027
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,137
They heard an orderly went batshit
on a patient.

1028
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:44,098
They're looking all over the place for
him and they're on their way to the roof.

1029
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:46,058
Let's get the hell out of here. This way.

1030
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:51,397

-What do you mean?
-I mean,

1035
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,662
where were you?

1036
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,792
After we got that guy to the infirmary,
I took a little detour to patient records.

1037
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:14,003
Did you ever find Laeddis?

1038
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:16,005
No. No, I never found him.

1039
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:19,008
Well, I got the next best thing.
His intake form.

1040
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:21,218
It was the only thing in his files.
There's no session notes,

1041
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:25,014
no incident reports, no photographs,
just this. It was weird.

1042
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:26,766
Here. Take a look.

1043
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:28,934
I'll look at it later.

1044
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:32,229
What's the matter, boss?

1045
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:35,608
I'll look it over later, that's all.

1046
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:40,946
-Ashecliffe's that way.
-I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

1047
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:44,408
I'm going to that lighthouse.

1048
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,827
I'm gonna find out what the fuck
is happening on this island.

1049
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,385
TEDDY: There it is.

1050
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:07,223
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to double back.

1051
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:09,517
There's no way we could cross
those rocks.

1052
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:11,268
There could be a way
behind those trees.

1053
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:14,438
Maybe a path that goes around the
rocks and leads over to the lighthouse.

1054
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:15,564
-Boss...
-Come on.

1055
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,025
Wait, wait, what are we doing?
We got the intake form.

1056
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,902
It's proof there's a 67th patient,

1057
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:22,822
which they said, repeatedly,
doesn't exist.

1058
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:26,492

What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

1060

Why would you want to, Chuck? Why?

1061
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:34,834
Because climbing down there
when it's dark

1062
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:38,087
is a thin step short of suicide,
that's why.

1063
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:41,590
Okay, maybe you better
sit this one out then.

1064
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:45,177
You brought me into this, boss,

1065
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:48,597
and now we're trapped here on this rock,
on this island,

1066
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,224

I was never married.

01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:32,566
And before I was a patient at Ashecliffe,
I worked here.

1107

-And if I say I'm not crazy?

That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:01,470
People tell the world you're crazy,

1114
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:05,474

Once you're declared insane,

then anything you do is called
part of that insanity.

01:25:36,589 --> 01:25:40,008

large shipments of sodium amytal

Psychotropic drugs.

1127

I asked about the surgeries, too.

You ever heard of
a transorbital lobotomy?

1129

They zap the patient with electroshock,

1130
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:58,777
then go through the eye with an ice pick,

1131
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,031
pull out some nerve fibers.

1132
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:07,911
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1134
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,291
It's barbaric,

1135
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:14,793
unconscionable.

1136
01:26:15,795 --> 01:26:19,548
Do you know how pain
enters the body, Marshal? Do you?

1137
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,259
Depends on where you're hurt?

1138
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:24,887
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.

1139
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:27,306
The brain controls pain.

1140
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:32,519
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep,
hunger, anger. Everything.

1141
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:36,648
What if you could control it?

1142
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:40,152
-You mean the brain?
-Recreate a man

1143
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:45,407
so he doesn't feel pain or love
or sympathy.

1144
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:48,410
A man who can't be interrogated,

1145
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:51,205
because he has no memories
to confess.

1146
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:57,461
You can never take away
all a man's memories. Never.

1147
01:26:57,545 --> 01:27:01,673
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1148
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,425
during their brainwashing experiments.

1149
01:27:03,509 --> 01:27:06,929
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

1150
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:09,097
They're creating ghosts
to go out in the world

1151
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:12,434
and do things sane men...
Sane men never would.

1152
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:15,854
To have that kind of ability,
that kind of knowledge,

1153
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,607
-that would take years.
-Years. Years of research.

1154
01:27:18,691 --> 01:27:21,401
Hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1155
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:26,615
Fifty years from now, people will
look back and say, here, this place,

1156
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:29,159
is where it all began.

1157
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:34,039
The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used
prisoners in their own Gulags, and we,

1158
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:38,335
we tested patients on Shutter Island.

1159
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:41,672
No, they won't.

1160
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:43,632
No.

1161
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,220
You do understand

1162
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:53,058
that they can't let you leave.

1163
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:56,687
I am a federal marshal.
They can't stop me.

1164
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:03,151
I was an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family.

1165
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,863
Didn't matter.

1166
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:13,620
Let me ask you.
Any past traumas in your life?

1167
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:16,248
Yes.

1168
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,501
But why would that matter?

1169
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:21,878
Because they're gonna point
to some event in your past

1170
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:24,464
and say it's the reason
you lost your sanity.

1171
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:29,928
So that when they commit you here,
your friends and colleagues will say,

1172
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:31,930
"Of course he cracked.

1173
01:28:32,932 --> 01:28:34,182
"Who wouldn't
after what he'd been through?"

1174
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:36,768
They can say that about anyone,
anyone at all.

1175
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:39,813
The point is
they're gonna say it about you.

1176
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:46,862
-How's your head?
-My head?

1177
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:50,365
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

1178
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:56,913
-Headaches?
-I am prone to migraines, yes.

1179
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,290
Jesus.

1180
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:04,087
You haven't taken any pills, have you?
I mean, even aspirin?

1181
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,340
-The aspirin?
-Jesus.

1182
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:10,719
And you ate the food in the cafeteria
and drank the coffee they gave you?

1183
01:29:10,803 --> 01:29:14,181
You tell me, at least, that you've
been smoking your own cigarettes.

1184
01:29:15,975 --> 01:29:19,269
No.

1185
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,730
No, I haven't.

1186
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:24,566
It takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics

1187
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:27,235
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

1188
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,864
Palsy comes first,

1189
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:35,243
first the fingertips,
then eventually the whole hand.

1190
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:40,332

lately, Marshal? Huh?

1191

Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse.

1203

I'm afraid if they come looking for you,
they might find me.

1204

I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1205
01:30:55,032 --> 01:30:56,658
I'm gonna come back for you.

1206
01:30:56,742 --> 01:30:59,703
I won't be here. I move during the day.
New places every night.

1207
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:02,122
But I could come get you,
get you off this island.

Haven't you heard a word I've said?

and they control it.

You'll never leave here.

1211

I had a friend.

1212
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,978
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1213

1214
01:31:28,941 --> 01:31:30,275

1215
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,945

We were wondering
when you'd show up.

1222
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:35,674
I was just looking around.

1223
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:41,054
Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

1224
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:44,015
-What?
-God's gift.

1225
01:32:46,185 --> 01:32:47,519
The violence.

1226
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:54,734
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1227
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:58,655
it reached out for me like a divine hand.

1228
01:33:00,866 --> 01:33:02,701
God loves violence.

1229
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:08,206
-I hadn't noticed.
-(CHUCKLES) Sure you have.

1230
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:11,543

1231
01:33:11,877 --> 01:33:13,253
It's in us.

1232
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:15,130
It's what we are.

1233
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:18,883
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,

1234
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:21,511
and pillage and plunder
and tear at the flesh of our brothers.

1235
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:25,515
And why? Because God gave us
violence to wage in his honor.

1236
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:31,146
I thought God gave us moral order.

1237

1238

There's no moral order at all.
There's just this,

1239
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:41,197
can my violence conquer yours?

1240
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:48,997
-I'm not violent.
-Yes, you are.

1241
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:52,542
You're as violent as they come.

1242

between you and a meal,

Oh, extremely.
He can be quite upsetting.

1276
01:36:18,147 --> 01:36:19,856
As a matter of fact, two weeks ago,

1277
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:24,402
a patient got so wound up by one
of Noyce's stories that he beat him up.

You know, I've built
something valuable here,

01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:32,134
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1362
01:46:33,845 --> 01:46:36,847
(STAMMERING) I don't know
what you're talking about.

1363
01:46:40,018 --> 01:46:41,936
Yes, he's here.

1364
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:46,023
Have Dr. Sheehan take a look
at your man before you send him up.

1365
01:46:46,108 --> 01:46:50,820
So Dr. Sheehan came in on the ferry
this morning, huh?

1366
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,280
Not exactly.

1367
01:46:54,324 --> 01:46:57,368
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1368
01:46:58,286 --> 01:47:00,371
Sorry to hear about that.

1369
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:06,043
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1370
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:09,088
How are the hallucinations?

1371
01:47:09,172 --> 01:47:13,342
DOLORES: Get out of here, Teddy.
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1372
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:18,222
Not bad.

1373
01:47:18,306 --> 01:47:20,891
-They'll get worse.
-TEDDY: I know.

1374
01:47:21,768 --> 01:47:26,063
Dr. Solando,
she told me about the neuroleptics.

1375
01:47:26,606 --> 01:47:29,066
Did she, now? And when was this?

1376
01:47:29,151 --> 01:47:33,946
I found her, Doctor,
in a cave out by the cliffs.

1377
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:36,574
-But you'll never get to her.
-I don't doubt it,

1378
01:47:37,534 --> 01:47:39,201
considering she's not real.

1379
01:47:41,121 --> 01:47:44,248
Your delusions are more severe
than I thought.

1380
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,626
You're not on neuroleptics.

1381
01:47:48,086 --> 01:47:49,962
You're not on anything,
as a matter of fact.

1382
01:47:50,046 --> 01:47:52,673
Then what the fuck is this? Huh?
What the fuck is this?

1383
01:47:52,757 --> 01:47:53,757
Withdrawal.

1384
01:47:54,759 --> 01:47:56,719
Withdrawal? From what?

1385
01:47:56,803 --> 01:47:59,138
I haven't had a goddamn drink
since I've been on this island.

1386
01:47:59,222 --> 01:48:00,848
Chlorpromazine.

1387
01:48:01,683 --> 01:48:04,935
I'm not a fan of pharmacology,
but I have to say, in your case...

1388
01:48:05,437 --> 01:48:08,689
-(STAMMERING) Chloraproma-what?
-Chlorpromazine.

1389
01:48:08,773 --> 01:48:12,776
The same thing we've been giving you
for the past 24 months.

1390
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:16,197
Oh, so for the past two years, you...

1391
01:48:16,281 --> 01:48:19,575
You've had somebody slipping me drugs
in Boston. Is that it?

1392
01:48:19,659 --> 01:48:21,118
Not Boston.

1393
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:22,786
Here.

1394
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:27,541
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

1395
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:33,464
After everything I've seen here, Doctor,

1396
01:48:35,133 --> 01:48:38,552
you really think you're gonna
convince me I'm crazy, huh?

1397
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:40,596
Do you know the kind of people
that I deal with every day?

1398
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:42,556
I'm a U.S. Marshal, for God's sakes.

1399
01:48:42,641 --> 01:48:44,517
You were a U.S. Marshal.

1400
01:48:44,601 --> 01:48:48,395
Here's a copy of the intake form
you broke into Ward C for.

1401
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,855
Proof of the 67th patient.

1402
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,106
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,

1403
01:48:51,191 --> 01:48:52,983
you could have blown the lid
off this place.

1404
01:48:53,068 --> 01:48:54,443
-Wait. Where did... Where did you...
-Yet somehow,

1405
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:57,446
you couldn't find time to look at it.
Well, read it now.

1406
01:48:58,323 --> 01:48:59,698
Go ahead.

1407
01:49:03,495 --> 01:49:07,331
"Patient is highly intelligent, highly
delusional decorated Army veteran.

1408

01:49:22,847 --> 01:49:25,516
I've had enough of this bullshit!
Where's my partner, huh?

1415
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:27,184
Where's Chuck? Where is he?

1416
01:49:27,978 --> 01:49:29,687
Let's try this another way.

1417
01:49:29,771 --> 01:49:32,314
Your wife's maiden name was Chanal,
am I correct?

1418
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:33,816
Don't you even talk about her.
Don't you...

1419
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:35,776
I'm afraid I have to.

1420
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:39,989
Notice anything
these four names have in common?

1421
01:49:40,198 --> 01:49:41,699
It's your rule of four.

1422
01:49:42,158 --> 01:49:43,284
Andrew, what do you see?

1423
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:46,370
If you've done anything to my partner,
Doctor, that is a violation of...

1424
01:49:46,454 --> 01:49:48,872
Focus, Andrew! What do you see?

1425
01:49:49,874 --> 01:49:52,376
The names have the same letters.

1426
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:56,672
Edward Daniels has exactly
the same 13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.

1427
01:49:56,756 --> 01:49:58,966
The same as Rachel Solando
and Dolores Chanal.

1428
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:01,135
The names are anagrams
for each other.

1429
01:50:01,219 --> 01:50:03,804
Your tactics,
they're not gonna work on me.

1430
01:50:03,888 --> 01:50:06,682
You came here for the truth. Here it is.

1431
01:50:06,766 --> 01:50:08,767
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1432
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:12,396
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1433
01:50:14,232 --> 01:50:15,190
Bullshit.

1434
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:17,484
You were committed here by court order
24 months ago.

1435
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:20,904
Your crime is terrible,
one you can't forgive yourself for,

1436
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:23,324
so you invented another self.

1437
01:50:23,408 --> 01:50:25,451
(BREATHING TREMULOUSLY)

1438
01:50:25,535 --> 01:50:26,952
All right.

1439
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:30,122
(STAMMERING) Let's get down
to the facts, all right?

1440
01:50:30,206 --> 01:50:33,083
You've created a story
in which you're not a murderer.

1441
01:50:33,168 --> 01:50:37,212
You're a hero, still a U.S. Marshal, only
here at Ashecliffe because of a case,

1442
01:50:37,297 --> 01:50:38,797
and you've uncovered a conspiracy

1443
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:42,426
so that anything we tell you
about who you are, what you've done,

1444
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:44,553
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1445
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:45,929
My name is Edward Daniels.

1446
01:50:46,014 --> 01:50:50,267
I've been hearing this fantasy
for two years now. I know every detail.

1447
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:52,311
Patient 67, the storm,

1448
01:50:52,395 --> 01:50:55,606
Rachel Solando, your missing partner,
the dreams you have every night.

1449
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:58,108
You were at Dachau,
but you may not have killed any guards.

1450
01:50:59,861 --> 01:51:01,111
(SIGHS)

1451
01:51:02,155 --> 01:51:05,824
I wish I could let you
just live in your fantasy world.

1452
01:51:05,909 --> 01:51:07,368
I really do.

1453
01:51:08,244 --> 01:51:10,454
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.

1454
01:51:10,538 --> 01:51:12,831
You're the most dangerous patient
we have.

1455
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:15,209
You've injured orderlies, guards,
other patients.

1456
01:51:15,293 --> 01:51:17,211
Two weeks ago,
you attacked George Noyce.

1457
01:51:17,295 --> 01:51:19,546
No, no. I am fucking on to you, Doctor.

1458
01:51:19,631 --> 01:51:21,507
-You had Noyce beaten.
-Of course I didn't!

1459
01:51:21,591 --> 01:51:23,676
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him!

1460
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,136
Because he called you Laeddis,

1461
01:51:26,221 --> 01:51:29,264
and you'd do anything not to be him.

1462
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:32,935
I have a transcript of the conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1463
01:51:33,019 --> 01:51:37,064
"This is about you, and, Laeddis,
that's all it's ever been about."

1464
01:51:38,983 --> 01:51:41,485
No, no. He's saying
this is about me and Laeddis.

1465
01:51:41,569 --> 01:51:43,445
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

1466
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:46,907
he said, now here I'm quoting again,
"You did this."

1467
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:49,118
No, no, he meant that it was my fault.

1468
01:51:49,202 --> 01:51:51,203
You almost killed him.

1469
01:51:52,872 --> 01:51:55,666
The warden and the Board of Overseers
are determined something be done.

1470
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:57,459
It's been decided

1471
01:51:57,544 --> 01:52:00,379
that unless we can bring you
back to sanity now,

1472
01:52:00,672 --> 01:52:01,964
right now,

1473
01:52:02,257 --> 01:52:05,676
permanent measures will be taken to
ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1474
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:12,516
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.
Do you understand?

1475
01:52:16,771 --> 01:52:18,689
Yeah, I understand.

1476
01:52:19,524 --> 01:52:21,734
I understand just fine.

1477
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:26,447
If I don't play along
with your little game here,

1478
01:52:26,531 --> 01:52:29,658
Dr. Naehring's gonna turn me
into one of his ghosts.

1479
01:52:30,118 --> 01:52:31,493
But what about my partner?

1480
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:36,039
You gonna tell the U.S. Marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1481
01:52:37,917 --> 01:52:39,376
Hello, boss.

1482
01:52:56,227 --> 01:52:59,396
(SOFTLY) What the fuck
is going on here? Hmm?

1483
01:53:00,482 --> 01:53:01,565
Huh?

1484
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:05,527
You working for him?

1485
01:53:06,362 --> 01:53:07,863
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.

1486
01:53:07,947 --> 01:53:10,866
Someone had to stick with you,
keep you safe.

1487
01:53:13,745 --> 01:53:15,871
You been watching me, huh?

1488
01:53:16,831 --> 01:53:18,916
Watching me every minute.

1489
01:53:19,834 --> 01:53:21,126
Who are you?

1490
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:22,961
Who are you? Tell me.

1491
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:25,631
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1492
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:30,761
I've been your primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1493
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:33,222
I'm Lester Sheehan.

1494
01:53:39,687 --> 01:53:42,356
-I told you... I told you about my wife, I...
-I know.

1495
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:45,692
I climbed down a cliff to get you.
I trusted you.

1496
01:53:45,777 --> 01:53:49,404
I risked everything to come in here
after you. Everything!

1497
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:52,241
-I know, boss.
-We're running out of time here, Andrew.

1498
01:53:53,785 --> 01:53:55,369
I swore before the Board of Overseers

1499
01:53:55,453 --> 01:53:59,373
that I could construct the most radical,
cutting-edge role-play

1500
01:53:59,457 --> 01:54:01,708
ever attempted in psychiatry,
and it would bring you back.

1501
01:54:01,793 --> 01:54:04,169
I thought that if we let you play this out

1502
01:54:04,921 --> 01:54:08,549
we could get you to see how untrue,
how impossible it is.

1503
01:54:09,634 --> 01:54:12,094
You've had the run of the place
for two days.

1504
01:54:12,178 --> 01:54:15,472
Tell me, where are
the Nazi experiments?

1505
01:54:15,557 --> 01:54:17,349
The satanic ORs?

1506
01:54:30,989 --> 01:54:34,533
Andrew, listen to me.

1507
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:36,827
If we fail with you,

1508
01:54:37,579 --> 01:54:41,498
then everything that we've tried to do
here will be discredited. Everything.

1509
01:54:43,626 --> 01:54:46,795
We're on the front lines of a war
here, old boy.

1510
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:50,424
And right now, it all comes down to you.

1511
01:54:57,348 --> 01:55:00,058
-Don't move! Don't move!
-Andrew! Andrew! No. No.

1512
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:03,353
(ENUNCIATING) My name
is Edward Daniels!

1513
01:55:03,438 --> 01:55:05,480
This one's loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

1514
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:08,150
I see. And that's your firearm, Marshal?
You're sure?

1515
01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:09,443
My initials are on the side.

1516
01:55:09,527 --> 01:55:11,820
There's a dent in the barrel
from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1517
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:14,031
You're not gonna fuck with my mind
on this one, Doctor!

1518
01:55:14,115 --> 01:55:15,157
CAWLEY: Then blast away.

1519
01:55:15,241 --> 01:55:18,577
Because that's the only way
you're ever getting off this island.

1520
01:55:24,667 --> 01:55:26,543
Andrew, please don't.

1521
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:38,722
My gun.

1522
01:55:45,313 --> 01:55:47,898
What did you do to my goddamn gun?

1523
01:55:48,316 --> 01:55:50,484
It's a toy, Andrew.

1524
01:55:52,987 --> 01:55:55,072
We're telling you the truth.

1525
01:55:55,573 --> 01:55:58,825
Dolores was insane,
manic-depressive, suicidal.

1526
01:55:59,494 --> 01:56:02,579
You drank, stayed away,
ignored what everyone told you.

1527
01:56:02,664 --> 01:56:03,789
You moved to that lake house

1528
01:56:03,873 --> 01:56:07,000
after she purposely set
your city apartment on fire.

1529
01:56:07,085 --> 01:56:08,377
-You were...
-(SCREAMING) You're lying!

1530
01:56:08,461 --> 01:56:11,922
-Andrew! Andrew, stop. No.
-You drugged the cigarettes!

1531
01:56:12,006 --> 01:56:13,840
-All you've done is lie!
-Andrew. Andrew.

1532
01:56:13,925 --> 01:56:16,468
Your children. Andrew, your children.

1533

Simon. Henry.

1534
01:56:20,264 --> 01:56:21,556
I never had any children.

1535
01:56:21,641 --> 01:56:25,686
Your wife drowned them
at the cabin by the lake.

1536
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:28,981
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

1537
01:56:29,691 --> 01:56:31,358
every night.

1538
01:56:31,442 --> 01:56:32,609
I never had a little girl.

1539
01:56:32,694 --> 01:56:36,279
The one who tells you over and over
that you should have saved her,

1540
01:56:36,364 --> 01:56:38,281
saved them all.

1541
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:40,826
Your daughter, her name was Rachel.

1542
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:43,787
Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1543
01:56:44,539 --> 01:56:46,289
Andrew, are you?

1544
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:11,356
DOLORES: (WHIMPERING)
I'm so sorry, baby.

1545
01:57:15,737 --> 01:57:18,113
I told you not to come in here.

1546
01:57:18,573 --> 01:57:22,534
I told you this would be the end of you.

1547
01:57:42,889 --> 01:57:44,222
I'm back!

1548
01:57:44,849 --> 01:57:47,601
We got him just outside of Oklahoma.

1549
01:57:47,685 --> 01:57:50,228
Must've stopped 10 places
in between here and Tulsa.

1550
01:57:50,313 --> 01:57:52,397
I could sleep for a week.

(BLUES MUSIC PLAYING)

1552
01:57:56,360 --> 01:58:05,911
Dolores?

1553
01:58:10,708 --> 01:58:13,001
PREACHER: And he said, "Take up
your bed and walk." But God?

1554
01:58:13,086 --> 01:58:14,127
Dolores?

1555
01:58:14,212 --> 01:58:15,504
PREACHER: Then he said, "Take up
your bed and walk."

1556
01:58:15,588 --> 01:58:17,589
Forgive sins, but God?

1557
01:58:28,559 --> 01:58:29,935
Dolores?

1558
01:58:55,253 --> 01:58:56,503
Baby,

1559
01:58:58,548 --> 01:59:00,423
why are you all wet?

1560
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,302
I missed you.

1561
01:59:11,686 --> 01:59:13,353
I wanna go home.

1562
01:59:16,482 --> 01:59:17,983
You are home.

1563
01:59:23,156 --> 01:59:24,990
Where are the kids?

1564
01:59:27,618 --> 01:59:28,618
Hmm?

1565
01:59:29,036 --> 01:59:30,787
They're in school.

1566
01:59:34,959 --> 01:59:36,960
It's Saturday, honey.

1567
01:59:38,129 --> 01:59:40,338
School's not in on Saturday.

1568
01:59:42,967 --> 01:59:44,593
My school is.

1569
01:59:57,940 --> 01:59:59,482
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

Baby.

1581
02:02:12,283 --> 02:02:14,784
Let's put them at the table, Andrew.

1582
02:02:15,619 --> 02:02:18,830
We'll dry them off.
We'll change their clothes.

1583
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,418
They'll be our living dolls. Huh?

1584
02:02:27,465 --> 02:02:30,216
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1585
02:02:35,222 --> 02:02:37,182

please stop talking.

I love you.

1588

Set me free.

Oh, baby.

1590
02:03:07,671 --> 02:03:09,589
We'll give them baths.

Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.

Rachel who?

Rachel. Rachel Laeddis.

1604
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:16,281
My daughter.

1605
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:21,619
Why are you here?

1606
02:04:24,832 --> 02:04:26,374
Because I killed my wife.

1607
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:28,585
And why did you do that?

1608
02:04:32,089 --> 02:04:35,258
Because she murdered our children,

1609
02:04:38,179 --> 02:04:39,721
and she told me to let her go.

1610
02:04:43,767 --> 02:04:46,936
-Who's Teddy Daniels?
-He doesn't exist.

1611
02:04:49,273 --> 02:04:51,733
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1612
02:04:51,817 --> 02:04:55,778
-Why?
-CAWLEY: We need to hear you say it.

1613
02:05:02,369 --> 02:05:05,580
After she tried to kill herself
the first time,

1614
02:05:07,625 --> 02:05:09,584
Dolores told me she...

1615
02:05:10,544 --> 02:05:14,797
She had an insect living
inside her brain.

1616
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:21,513
She could feel it
clicking across her skull,

1617
02:05:21,597 --> 02:05:25,808
just pulling the wires just for fun.

1618
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:31,272
She told me that.

1619
02:05:32,733 --> 02:05:35,568
She told me that, but I didn't listen.

1620
02:05:39,281 --> 02:05:41,574
I loved her so much, you know.

1621
02:05:42,993 --> 02:05:44,619
CAWLEY: Why did you make them up?

1622
02:05:47,248 --> 02:05:51,167
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1623
02:05:55,005 --> 02:05:56,339
And I...

1624
02:05:58,842 --> 02:06:03,346
I killed them 'cause I didn't get her help,
you know.

1625
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,185
I killed them.

1626

Here's my fear, Andrew.

1627
02:06:15,192 --> 02:06:18,403
We broke through once before,
nine months ago,

1628
02:06:18,487 --> 02:06:19,487
and then you regressed.

1629
02:06:22,032 --> 02:06:25,368
-I don't remember that.
-I know.

1630
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:28,663
You reset, Andrew.

1631
02:06:29,123 --> 02:06:33,209
Like a tape playing over and over
on an endless loop.

1632
02:06:34,461 --> 02:06:35,920
I hope that what we've done here
will be enough

1633
02:06:36,005 --> 02:06:39,132
to stop it from ever happening again,

1634
02:06:39,216 --> 02:06:42,719
but I need to know
you've accepted reality.

1635
02:06:49,226 --> 02:06:51,978
You came after me, huh, Doctor?

1636
02:06:53,856 --> 02:06:57,734

when no one else would.

in the spring of '52.

-Can't complain.

02:08:03,759 --> 02:08:05,343
So what's our next move?

1642
02:08:06,637 --> 02:08:08,096
You tell me.

1643
02:08:13,310 --> 02:08:15,144
We gotta get off this rock, Chuck.

1644
02:08:16,313 --> 02:08:17,605
Get back to the mainland.

1645
02:08:17,690 --> 02:08:20,650
Whatever the hell's going on here,
it's bad.

1646

(INAUDIBLE)

(WHISPERING) Don't worry, partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

That's right. We're too smart for them.

1649

Yeah, we are, aren't we?

1650
02:09:13,078 --> 02:09:15,830
You know,
this place makes me wonder...

1651
02:09:16,373 --> 02:09:18,458
Yeah, what's that, boss?

1652
02:09:19,418 --> 02:09:21,377
Which would be worse,

1653
02:09:22,212 --> 02:09:23,880
to live as a monster

1654
02:09:24,798 --> 02:09:26,466
or to die as a good man?

1655
02:09:36,185 --> 02:09:37,477
