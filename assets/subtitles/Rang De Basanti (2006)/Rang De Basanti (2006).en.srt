00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,541
If yet your blood does not rage..

3
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,583
..then it is water that flows in your veins.

4
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,916
For what is the flush of youth..

5
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:20,916
..if it is not of service to the motherland.

6
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,250
Just a minute Mr. McKinley, one revolutionary is meeting another.

7
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,666
Thank you. Shall we go?

8
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:15,666
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

9
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:20,458
This isn't the end Mr. McKinley. This is just the beginning.

10
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:24,458
There will be others after we have gone. Many others.

11
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,791
I always believed that there were two kinds of men in this world.

12
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,625
Men who go to their death screaming and men..

13
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:48,125
..who go to their death in silence.

14
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:52,125
And then I met the third kind.

15
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,541
Sometimes in my dreams I can still see them making their..

16
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,500
..long last walk.

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,500
They never so much as broke their stride.

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,375
They never faltered.

19
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,750
But above all others I remembered his eyes.

20
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,291
How they looked at me. Clear, defiant..

21
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:26,291
..never wavering.

22
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,333
It's time..

23
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,000
Hi.. - Hi..

24
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,000
Good morning..

25
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:06,000
Good morning. - Good morning.

26
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,791
So, Sonia, my contact in Delhi, has gathered some information..

27
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,916
..and we have to wire her some money to secure it.

28
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,916
Everything is cash up there.

29
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,500
Have I come to the wrong meeting?

30
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,250
We had directive from above, by Jacobs.

31
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,041
We had to make some very tough decisions.

32
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:35,083
Sorry Sue, I am really sorry.

33
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,708
If you do an episode on Gandhi that would work for us..

34
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,458
You know Gandhi sells, I suggest some fairy tales or even Robin Hood.

35
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:48,375
But these revolutionaries, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Ali..

36
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,708
It's Azad, Chandrashekhar Azad and Azad means freedom.

37
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,541
Azad sorry and I know what it means Sue.

38
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,500
I don't believe this, everything has been set up..

39
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,041
..and I have been working on this for the past two years.

40
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:01,083
I have been going to Hindi night classes.

41
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,541
Look..- Please, their story deserves to be told.

42
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,041
This is my grandfather's diary. He was an eye witness.

43
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,458
This is filled with real conversations.

44
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,625
Their very words. Boys not older than 23 fighting the empire.

45
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,625
That's an important story. A bloody important..

46
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:56,458
This is not the end Miss McKinley.

47
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,833
Sue.. Sue.

48
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,125
Can I talk to you?

49
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:06,541
Where are you going? - To India, to shoot a documentary.

50
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll send you a postcard. - How? With what?

51
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,000
Your Mother's eye.

52
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,208
Are you talking or hijacking her?

53
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:51,583
Get out of the way! Scoot!

54
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,708
First time in India, madam? Don't worry. - Yes! No..

55
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,541
Are you married? Even I and my wife are married.

56
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,833
Sue, you don't have to worry he is with me.

57
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,541
Yeah, I am with her.. With me.

58
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,125
Oh, it's so good to see you.

59
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,458
I can't believe it you are here. That it's happening at last.

60
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,000
Sorry about the short notice.

61
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,416
Mind-blowing! Your Hindi has really improved. - Thank you.

62
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:19,416
Don't worry, all the preparations are done.

63
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,333
Hey Sue, no need to worry..

64
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,458
All the preparations are done.

65
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,500
..posters have been put up everywhere.

66
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,583
It's also been announced on radio.

67
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:46,708
just see, they'll be lining up for the auditions.

68
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,625
What's wrong?

69
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:57,416
I didn't tell you. The truth is that I've come alone.

70
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,416
..no money, no producer is going to arrive.

71
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,291
I know. - You knew it!

72
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:10,583
After Alice, there was a call from Beth Williams..

73
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,625
..she informed me of the cancellation of the show..

74
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,958
..and also my services.

75
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:23,416
By the way, did you abuse her in Hindi?

76
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,625
She wanted to know what it meant.

77
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,625
I explained to her in graphic detail.

78
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,875
You are amazing.. Sonia.

79
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,750
What's that? - That's the Red Fort.

80
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:04,166
This is Delhi University. Let me help you with your luggage.

81
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:08,500
How much? - Ma'am I've already told you.

82
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,708
No, no.. - I can help.

83
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,083
Thanks Ravi, you are a sweetheart.

84
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,333
Ravi, please get all the luggage to our room. - Fine.

85
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,333
Thank you.

86
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:24,041
Hello which country, madam? - India, I hope.

87
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,166
Your room. - Okay.

88
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,125
Get some rest now. I'll see you tomorrow..

89
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,708
..If you need anything you have my number.

90
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,416
Thanks. - Okay.

91
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:52,083
Let's go Ravi.

92
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,666
My Grandpa was right..

93
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:58,666
..he said when you come to India, it's love at first sight.

94
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,333
Hi this is Dabbo speaking. And my hobbies..

95
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,333
..are bikes, babes and body building.

96
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,750
"Little child what do you behold in your infant hands.."

97
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:49,125
"Little child what do you behold in your infant hands.."

98
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,416
Oh no!

99
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,875
I can't do this.

100
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,375
Listen.. - Just try once.

101
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,416
I can't do this.

102
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:10,875
I deserve a role because I have dimples just like Priety Zinta.

103
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,833
"When flowers in the garden bloom.."

104
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,833
"Jana, Gana, Mana, Vande Matram.."

105
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,041
Because women can make possible impossible..

106
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,708
..impossible possible.

107
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:46,958
I love you.

108
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,750
Hi, how's that?

109
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,666
"When flowers in the garden bloom.."

110
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,541
Don't sing. Just recite "Vande Matram". - Vande Matram?

111
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,541
"Vande Matram Jana, Gana, Mana.." "Vande Matram Jana, Gana, Mana.."

112
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,625
Rascal, if you have the guts then come out.

113
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,916
Everyone calls me Bhai..

114
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,708
Raise your hand and say Vande Matram! - Vande Matram!

115
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,583
Speak loudly, Vande Matram! - Vande Matram.

116
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,208
Loudly and proudly, Vande Matram! - Vande Matram

117
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,541
Vande Matram! - Vande Matram..

118
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,333
I know about the fight.

119
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,166
I have dedicated my life to the freedom of this nation.

120
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,583
I have dedicated my life to the freedom of this nation.

121
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,250
I know you want me to get married.

122
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,791
..but Freedom is my bride.

123
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,791
I know.. I know.. that..

124
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,791
I know.. that you want me to get married..

125
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,000
..but my bride is Freedom

126
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,541
..but my bride is Freedom.

127
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,791
Your obedient son, Bhagat Singh.

128
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,166
Bhagat Singh.

129
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,625
Bhagat Singh. - Anybody.

130
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,041
Bhagat Singh.

131
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,000
My turn. - My turn.

132
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,000
My name is Bhagat Singh. Inquilab Zindabad.

133
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,000
Tea! - Thanks.

134
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,750
Depressed huh?

135
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,500
One or two of them can be used for minor roles..

136
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,666
..but no one's even close for Azad or Bhagat Singh.

137
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,041
I guess it's all my fault.

138
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:39,541
No Sonia. You're my rock. It's my fault. I should have never come.

139
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,958
Sue, don't get so dejected.

140
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,791
I think we need a break.

141
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,416
Let's go and have some fun. - I'm in no mood Sonia.

142
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,291
We are going to the classroom. - Classroom.

143
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:54,291
Lose control.

144
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:03,375
Lose control.

145
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,500
One more chance, Lose.. lose..

146
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,500
Lose control.

147
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,791
C'mon..

148
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,791
Lose control.

149
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,916
Mr. Poet.. - Hey Sonia.

150
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,833
What's happening?

151
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:29,250
How are you? - Fine. How are you?

152
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,666
Aslam.. Sue McKinley. - Hi.

153
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,250
You too study at the University?

154
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,541
Wow! Her Hindi is great.

155
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,083
We live there, eat there..

156
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:41,041
..but no one has ever accused us of studying there.

157
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:46,500
What do you say Sonia? - Come.

158
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,208
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

159
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:56,166
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

160
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:02,583
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

161
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:09,000
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

162
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,041
Who are those maniacs?

163
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,416
That's DJ..

164
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,541
DJ I love you!!!

165
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:20,375
That's Sukhi.

166
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:26,041
Let's rock it!

167
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,541
DJ I love you!!!

168
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:33,291
I love you too baby!

169
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,791
Hey, bring it. .

170
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,250
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

171
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,791
- What are you doing?

172
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:44,708
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

173
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,958
Damn exhibitionists.

174
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,875
They'll never change.

175
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:58,541
Come on dude, let's rock it! - Let's do it.

176
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,375
Come on, Sukhi. Show everyone.

177
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:05,375
DJ! DJ! DJ!..

178
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:15,208
Is he OK?

179
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,541
Is he OK?

180
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,541
That's his natural pose.

181
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,250
Hey, pal. - DJ.

182
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,500
Sukhi, all parts working? - DJ!

183
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,541
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Who is this?

184
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,958
Sue this is DJ. DJ this is Sue. - Hi!

185
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:52,250
Sue? She's so pink her name should be Gulabo (Rose). - DJ.

186
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,416
She's quite hot..

187
00:18:55,916 --> 00:19:00,916
I mean it's very cold.

188
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:08,833
Karan you saved my life. I love you! - Love you too, Sukhi.

189
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,416
Aslam..

190
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,958
..you too saved my life,

191
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,750
I love you too!

192
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,750
It's ok.

193
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,375
She must have saved my life too..

194
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,791
No! Sukhi! She didn't save your life.

195
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,875
No problem. One day she'll save my life.

196
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:37,041
Coming.. - Hey brother, take a hike. She is your sister-in-law.

197
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:41,041
"One more time.." "Lose Control.."

198
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:53,750
"Lose Control."

199
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:00,666
"I'm a Rebel.."

200
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:08,083
"I am a rebel."

201
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:14,583
"There's aren't any students here, no teachers to suffer.."

202
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:20,750
"There's aren't any students here, no teachers to suffer.."

203
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,041
"Our school is a school filled with fun."

204
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:28,041
"Our school is a school filled with fun."

205
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,791
"Lose Control.."

206
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,583
Sukhi you just sit and watch like a dumb-ass..

207
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:43,916
DJ doesn't waste a second.

208
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,375
He's a stud.

209
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,041
Hi! How's everybody? Hi Rahul! What's up?

210
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,791
Got a few gigs lined up.

211
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,458
How's your radio thing going?

212
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,541
Its not Radio thing, it is Radio Jockey.

213
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:55,750
Did anything work out?

214
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,291
All India Radio has given me a night slot.

215
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,250
Means your scene is shaping up!

216
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,000
Not really. When the whole world's sleeping I'm on air.

217
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
But people stay up late..

218
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,041
Criminals, insomniacs, watchmen and idiots!

219
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,541
Have your fun at my expense.

220
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,541
Speaking of expenses.. Can I..

221
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:20,541
Trial Job, No income.

222
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,791
Thanks man, thanks a lot.

223
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,958
See you guys. Got a cigarette?

224
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:35,208
Okay, see you. Take care, thanks.

225
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,583
Fabulous! - Leave it.

226
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,583
It's my Dad's money. He's got loads of it..

227
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,083
Stop this Western music, this obscenity!

228
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,375
How many times do I have to make you understand this!

229
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,166
Polluting the culture of this country..

230
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,041
Leave this place right now. Leave!

231
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:06,083
Can't you understand, bastard!

232
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,750
This is your last warning..

233
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,416
..from now on, nobody plays any Western music out here.

234
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,250
No lewd dancing!

235
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:23,166
It is better you listen or I'll break your legs.

236
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,375
Who are you to warn us? If you don't like it, don't come here.

237
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:30,375
You bloody Pakistani!

238
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:38,416
Let's finish it.

239
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,750
Hey, empty this place.

240
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:59,166
Last warning! Got it?

241
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,166
Long live India!

242
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:10,750
Get up. Empty this place or we will arrest you.

243
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,500
You touch Aslam and see what I do to you..

244
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,083
..even your mother won't recognize you.

245
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:19,666
Ever seen a baboons arse?

246
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,541
Yours will be as red after I've finished with you.

247
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:27,791
Sir, I'm sure we can work it out. Come here. No matter..

248
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:33,416
You think too much of yourself don't you?

249
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:38,125
Keep this..

250
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,458
Was that a bribe?

251
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,375
Welcome to India Sue!

252
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:50,041
Anyone hungry? I'm famished.

253
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,041
Hey Sue, want a ride?

254
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:56,041
You've got insurance?

255
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:11,541
Karan..

256
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,500
Love you..

257
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,166
Shit!

258
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:42,916
Almost, almost..

259
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,833
You..!

260
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,250
How're you?

261
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:55,333
Hey honey! Come here you..

262
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:58,083
If something happened to you, I'd have killed you.

263
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:03,166
Is this any way to greet your boyfriend?

264
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:04,375
How're you?

265
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,333
Hey, how are you? - I am fine, how are you?

266
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,041
Mr. Rathod.. - Aslam, you keep growing tall.

267
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:14,166
Stop acting..

268
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,500
Sexy jacket, bro. - It is.

269
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,791
Hi, Ajay.. - Hi.

270
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,000
Flight lieutenant Ajay Rathod. - She's right.

271
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,291
Hurry guys, I'm famished.

272
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:22,791
You won't get any food here.

273
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,208
Hey Mitro, my mother, how are you? - Your Mitro is dead.

274
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:29,500
Stay away! You remembered your mother after two months..

275
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,833
..I carried you in my stomach for nine months..

276
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,291
..and washed your bum for years..

277
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,708
..and you come here as being a gentleman.

278
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:36,916
Get lost!

279
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:40,458
Does anyone bother to check if Mitro is alive or dead?

280
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,000
What's up?

281
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,458
You're drunk again.

282
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:46,416
No. No. No. - One is in military and other keeps enjoying.

283
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:50,291
First give us food ma, and then yell at us all night.

284
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,791
None of you have eaten? What will happen to this generation?

285
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:57,458
Sonia you've lost even more weight. - Really.. Mitro

286
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:01,541
The girls of today have more bones and less flesh..

287
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,333
How will you bear children?

288
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,250
How will you bear children?

289
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,916
Aslam, how are you my son? I didn't notice you.

290
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:13,708
He is my true son who bothers to check on me.

291
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:19,083
And he is one.. I committed a mistake by sending you to city.

292
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:22,458
Look ma, what I brought for you.

293
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:27,291
Your daughter-in-law. Her name is Sue.

294
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:29,250
What? A foreigner?

295
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,458
Brought her especially from London.

296
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,750
That's why I was away for so long.

297
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,875
I told her that's it's your first trip to India.

298
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,750
Give me your blessings Ma.

299
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,541
Your son's such a brat.

300
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:50,041
God! She understands Hindi!

301
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:54,541
She understands everything.

302
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,541
You really understand everything? - Yes.

303
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:58,833
What a problem!

304
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:03,250
I'm going off to sleep. Your beds are all ready.

305
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,291
No need to drive so late at night.

306
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:09,875
I saw them then..

307
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:13,875
..like they leapt out of the pages of grandpa's dairy.

308
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:37,291
Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Rajguru ..

309
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:40,791
..and Durga Bhabhi, Asfaqulla Khan

310
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:44,916
And they were sitting right in front of me.

311
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:48,083
Sue, where are you?

312
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:50,291
Will you guys act in my film?

313
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:51,541
What?

314
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:55,541
Will you guys act in my film? You all are perfect.

315
00:28:56,041 --> 00:29:00,416
Hey, why are you guys laughing? I'm the hero of her film.

316
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,458
Yeah we guys are champions when it comes to acting..

317
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,666
..clowning around is all they do.

318
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:07,250
I am serious okay.

319
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,583
The four of you will be perfect for the roles of Bhagat Singh..

320
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,458
..Chandrashekar Azad, Ashfaqulla Khan, Rajguru.

321
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,500
And Sonia will be my Durga Bhabhi.

322
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
She really knows Hindi!

323
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,291
All this talk of patriotism is boring.

324
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:25,791
Boring? These guys gave their lives for the freedom of your country.

325
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:28,500
What freedom? Have you seen the state of this country?

326
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,833
No one believes this rubbish thing.

327
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:34,416
Excuse me! I believe in this country, Karan.

328
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,833
Otherwise, why would I be fighting for it? - I don't know.

329
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:41,083
Maybe because it's cool! Being a pilot.. flying an expensive plane.

330
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,416
You get to wear fancy jackets..

331
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:46,625
And the women.. women love men in uniforms.

332
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,416
Sure I love being a pilot. Sure it's cool.

333
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:53,750
But I also feel proud of my country, and I can give my life for it.

334
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,958
Proud of what?

335
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:58,166
..this country's exploding population?

336
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,791
..or unemployment.. - or corruption?

337
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,500
Which of these are you really proud of?

338
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,791
Come on guys..

339
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:07,041
..no country's perfect Karan. We've got to make it better.

340
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,458
Right.

341
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:11,750
Ok, Ajay you make this country perfect.

342
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,041
The minute I get my degree I'm out of this dump..

343
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:19,250
You won't be able to leave us and go. - Wait and see.

344
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,916
She speaks Hindi so well!

345
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:27,125
Why didn't you tell me you son of a bitch..

346
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:31,125
..I was making a fool of myself.

347
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:38,791
At least ask them once, please.

348
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:41,583
So you won't give up.

349
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:45,791
Ok. But nobody will turn up.

350
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:49,791
They will come. I'll get them. That's a promise.

351
00:30:57,125 --> 00:31:01,666
Karan put your cigarette out.

352
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,458
Greetings grandpa!

353
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:06,791
God bless you. When did you come?

354
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:14,041
Just last night. Some friends.

355
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:18,041
Who is he? - DJ's grandfather.

356
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:29,625
Bye. - Bye Mitro.

357
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:33,625
You...

358
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,833
Good morning Karan. Back so early?

359
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,125
I didn't know you were in town.

360
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,416
Just arrived an hour ago.

361
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:08,375
It was a long flight.

362
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,666
Everything Ok at college? - Everything's fine Dad.

363
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,583
Have you decided which American university..

364
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,666
..you want to go to next year?

365
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:20,041
Michigan university, it's a famous university.. then there's..

366
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,250
Carnegie Mellon, Wharton..

367
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,250
I know the list.

368
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:32,041
Hello.. Karan wait!

369
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:38,333
I can't hear you clearly call me later. I told you to call later.

370
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:42,250
I know that you know about the lists.

371
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,041
But life doesn't just happen to you.

372
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:47,666
You've got to plan it..

373
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:52,791
Every second someone is born in this country's drainage.

374
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:56,250
Nobody cares about them. Neither the government nor God.

375
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,916
I don't want.

376
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:02,166
Do something. Or else you will be one of them.

377
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,250
Please, don't start with your lectures.

378
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,458
SMS generation. Any conversation that goes beyond..

379
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:12,500
..four lines becomes a lecture.

380
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,500
Hello..

381
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,958
Signal's weak here give me a second. I will just go out and talk.

382
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:26,791
Yes, tell me. The deal is off then, we are not interested..

383
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:28,958
You are wasting my time.

384
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,375
You know Russian quality is doubtful..

385
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:32,833
..they can't afford to be arrogant.

386
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,000
It is a profitable deal.

387
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,458
Anyway in the open market they'd not get half of it.

388
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:45,083
And you know how many fathers there..

389
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:51,458
..are to every deal in India.

390
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,291
Nothing.

391
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:57,291
Tell them we won't bargain, they should wire the money to us.

392
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,000
I did try to warn you.. they won't turn up.

393
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,708
DJ promised me.

394
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:26,750
Oh! DJ promised you!

395
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,500
So you really are a filmmaker?

396
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,208
Karan.. Why are you so late?

397
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:37,375
And where are the others?

398
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:44,500
The Young Guns Of India. Very dramatic.

399
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,458
Where are you going?

400
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,500
Well that's one part cast.

401
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,500
I am sure Karan can tell us where his friends are.

402
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:08,916
How are you? I am fine. I am preparing omelets.

403
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:11,666
She's an eight. Yeah! Wow! Nine.

404
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:15,333
What a girl! Oye Chotu get me a cup of tea..

405
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:20,541
Two, tell her to go..

406
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:21,916
Six..

407
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:27,500
Ten! What? - Ten from far and enough from close,

408
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Dude.. looks at those legs!

409
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,333
Shake it baby, shake it..

410
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:36,750
Oh shit!

411
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,416
Don't be silly, that's at least an eight.

412
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:41,625
Thought I'd find you stuffing your faces.

413
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,458
You lazy good for nothings.

414
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,833
We were about to come.. but..

415
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,833
..we are waiting for Karan actually.

416
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:51,000
Oh! So you were waiting for Karan. - Yes.

417
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,375
Karan was there on time. ..Yeah!

418
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:57,458
We are waiting for him here and he was waiting for us there.

419
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:01,958
We were supposed to meet here. - What confusion..

420
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,250
You're Ashfaqulla Khan.

421
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,541
You're Rajguru. - The hero right!

422
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,250
And you know who you are?

423
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,958
The Master of Disguise and Deception.

424
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:13,291
Chandrashekhar Azad.

425
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:15,083
I will die on you.

426
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:18,291
Learn the lines properly, we meet tomorrow.

427
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:21,125
The practice will be tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp!

428
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,666
Nine. - Sharp at eight.

429
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:27,666
That's fine. - We've already wasted a day..

430
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:35,666
Aslam, your sister-in-law looks even better when she's angry.

431
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:46,791
I have fallen in love.

432
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,791
What are you doing Laxman?

433
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:56,000
Party High Command is really happy with your work.

434
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,708
These demonstrations that you have started against Western culture..

435
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:05,666
..they've helped us overshadow other parties.

436
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:08,666
Come. Come.

437
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:14,625
Give me. - Take this.

438
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:18,083
This is for you. And this is for your boys.

439
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,333
It's not necessary, Mishraji.

440
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,750
I'm not doing this for money.

441
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,291
I really believe in the principles of my party.

442
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,333
That's fine Laxman..

443
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:35,166
..but every movement needs fuel.. Keep it.

444
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:41,333
Come, how is your work going on?

445
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:45,000
March the 14th we started our rehearsals.

446
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,000
To say I was nervous, would be an understatement.

447
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,333
"There is nothing you can do to break me."

448
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:04,541
"Because I have made pain my friend."

449
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:08,541
"..As I hold Death's fingers."

450
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,875
DJ idiot, don't spoil my concentration.

451
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:27,958
Please guys, be serious. - Okay, sorry..

452
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:33,125
Look, Death's finger.

453
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,041
"I've committed my life to the freedom of this country.

454
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:38,125
..I know you want me to get married..

455
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,125
..but I have made freedom my bride.."

456
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:44,250
"Your son, Bhagat Singh."

457
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,083
Who talks like this for God's sake? - Your son.

458
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:49,166
My bride is freedom.. what's his problem?

459
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:51,625
I think it's a good line for Sukhi..

460
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,166
Since no girl is ever going to marry him..

461
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,291
Let freedom be his bride.

462
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:58,416
Laugh bastards, laugh. I won't invite you in my marriage.

463
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:02,416
You were happy just now and now you turned sad.

464
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:13,958
"What sign did you make by touching my heart?"

465
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:20,041
"The climate has changed and I have started liking the environment.."

466
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:22,791
Wow! Great!

467
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:26,208
This is the sari round of the Miss Freedom contest.

468
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:29,125
Just thought it would help me get into the character.

469
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,666
Wow! - Idiots.

470
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:34,625
Hey, Miss Universe .. ..ity.

471
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,458
Look guys this isn't going to work.

472
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:42,208
You have to work hard to bring out the characters. And be serious.

473
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:46,250
Unless you emote from within..

474
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,375
..you won't understand these characters.

475
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:54,541
Try.. it will come from within you.

476
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:57,833
See, he's got a hold of his character already.

477
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:01,041
You understood the character pretty fast.

478
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,333
Please stop it. Just shut up or get out.

479
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:06,625
See! Now you look like a revolutionary!

480
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:10,500
Whatever you say Gulabo, you need me to create the mood.

481
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,666
DJ watch it.

482
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:17,125
Now she's upset! She's is upset..

483
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:21,583
She is smiling, she will be allured if she smiles.

484
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:25,666
Those are the words of a 23 year old.

485
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:29,416
That's how old Bhagat Singh was when he died: 23.

486
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:31,583
Those were different times Sue.

487
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,333
Today, if you tell people that you ..

488
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,333
..want to give your life for your country..

489
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:39,500
..they'll call you mad.

490
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,750
Exactly.

491
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:46,958
I can't relate to this..

492
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,833
That's it. Don't think.

493
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:54,958
Feel. Just read the words, and you'll get what he was feeling.

494
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,083
Why don't we try again?

495
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,833
Let's try again..

496
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:07,125
I've committed my life to the freedom of this country. - Good.

497
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:13,250
..a job.. a well settled life.. these things don't matter anymore.

498
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:20,750
..I know you want me to get married..

499
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,750
..but I have made freedom my bride..

500
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,250
I the son Mother India.. swear on this..

501
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:53,625
I the son Mother India.. swear on this pious fire..

502
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:56,500
This Aslam is a real stud..

503
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,500
Take a look at the packaging. Poetry, good looks, reading hands!

504
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,708
DJ, I'm scared at times that I'll remain a bachelor all my life.

505
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:14,041
Trust me I won't let you die a bachelor.

506
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:18,291
Promise.. - It's DJ's promise.

507
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:20,125
Oh no.

508
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,458
"You'll be writing people's destinies..

509
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,000
.." "You'll be bringing them on right path.."

510
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,500
Papu, change the channel. - "You know the art of changing destiny.."

511
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,500
"You have to go far beyond the lines.." - I like that.

512
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:40,500
Your love line is very strong..

513
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,166
The man of your dreams will come along in a black T-shirt and say:.

514
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:49,583
"What sign did you make by touching my heart.."

515
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:53,125
Do I even have a love line?

516
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:54,916
You must have washed it off in the loo.

517
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:57,916
"Defence Minister Shastri has also been implicated

518
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,666
in the MIG-21 kickbacks scandal,"

519
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:05,166
This is really depressing nonsense. Let's go DJ.

520
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:09,166
"This is a blatant lie. I am ordering an investigation."

521
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:17,750
"To the Mahal of the Taj.."

522
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,083
"To the Minar of Kutub.."

523
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:24,333
"To the Kumari of Kanya.."

524
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:27,500
"To the beaches of Goa.."

525
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,875
"To the whole of India, Zindabad.."

526
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,750
"All have something to say.."

527
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,875
"They all have something to say.."

528
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:38,791
"All have something to say.."

529
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:42,791
"They all have something to say.."

530
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,875
"India and Pakistan, Bangladesh all in a song.."

531
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,541
"Kajurao in Coimbatore.."

532
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:55,416
"Everyone all around say, our school is a school for fun.."

533
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:58,708
"..everyone all around say, our school is a school for fun.."

534
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:00,375
"To all the corners of the earth."

535
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,000
"To what is all our worth."

536
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,000
"What is out destiny?"

537
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,708
"From the King of India up to the Himalayas."

538
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:15,041
"Across the Ganga Jamuna."

539
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:19,041
"Our school is a school filled with fun."

540
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:25,458
"Lose control.."

541
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:45,625
Bye. - Bye.

542
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:46,875
See you guys.

543
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:50,958
You're my buddy.. I'll drop you home.

544
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:54,333
I don't need any help, it's just two lanes away. You just sit calmly.

545
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:58,333
We are not so drunk.. not to remember your home.

546
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:11,041
We are not so drunk.. not to remember your home.

547
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:14,041
Idiots!

548
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:18,041
You're very lucky to have friends like them.

549
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:25,500
One day this will all end.

550
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,666
We'll all go our separate ways.

551
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:32,000
But you can always keep in touch.

552
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,416
Doesn't happen.

553
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:36,750
Life gets busy.

554
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,333
Too many problems. Getting a job, a house, money.

555
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:45,333
And then dance to the tune of life.

556
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,458
In college we rule our destinies..

557
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:58,458
But after college we have to dance to fate's tune.

558
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:10,250
You know Gulabo, I passed out 5 years ago..

559
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,208
..but I still hang around..

560
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:15,500
I don't understand.

561
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,750
..I don't ever want to leave college.

562
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,666
Why?

563
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:28,333
At least in the campus I'm someone.. people know me.

564
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:32,541
DJ's somebody..

565
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:39,958
People expect me to do something big in life.

566
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:43,958
But when I'm out on the streets..

567
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:04,125
It's all the beer's fault.. Everything came out.

568
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:16,166
You know what else I'm scared of?

569
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:19,375
Acting in your film.

570
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:23,375
Don't worry.. you're in safe hands.

571
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:35,541
"My friend is tall but his lane is small."

572
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:39,041
It's Aslam's lane. - Mind you watch it. I am Muhamad Ali.

573
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:42,458
Don't be silly. Muhamad Ali. - Don't be silly.

574
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:45,375
Where have you been?

575
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:49,375
Hello Uncle..

576
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,208
We'll catch up tomorrow Aslam..

577
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:59,208
Let's go.

578
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,166
You've been drinking?

579
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:08,833
Father, you know I don't drink.

580
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:12,375
Good-for-nothings.. - Whatever, they're my friends.

581
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:16,333
Friends! They feel no shame standing in front of..

582
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:19,541
..your father with alcohol on their breath.

583
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:22,791
Why can't you get friends in your own community?

584
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,458
Why do you make friends with people who..

585
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,500
..corrupt you, disgrace your religion..

586
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,458
This has nothing to do with religion, Father.

587
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:34,583
Shut up! Don't raise your voice in the presence of your father.

588
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:37,291
He's right.

589
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:43,541
This country has never accepted Muslims and it never will..

590
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:46,500
How can you be so passive!

591
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,375
Do you ever see me mixing with a Hindu? Have you ever seen?

592
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:56,041
I'm not you and I don't want to be like you brother.

593
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:58,291
I can't fill myself with so much hate..

594
00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:00,791
Coward that's what you are.

595
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:02,541
Stop it!

596
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,791
I feel suffocated in this house. It's the same ..

597
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:08,791
..old thing every single day..

598
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:21,500
Carnivals will be held on our graves every year,

599
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,666
That's all that will be left of us, when we die for our country.

600
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:28,875
Well said. - Well said Ashfaq Sahab..

601
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:30,500
If the English could hear you they would ..

602
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,708
..leave this country in a moment.

603
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,875
So what has been decided?

604
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:42,750
We'll steal the Empire's money from the train that passes Kakori.

605
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,958
And with that money we will buy arms.

606
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:48,291
Bismil will explain everything.

607
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:51,416
Yes Bismil.. Where is my Ram?

608
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:53,916
Where is my Ram?

609
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:56,166
I just can't find my Ramprasad Bismil.

610
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:57,916
Relax. We will find him.

611
00:49:58,416 --> 00:49:59,875
But where? How?

612
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,625
Very soon. Don't you wo..

613
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,458
Oh no.

614
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:07,833
You won't get Ramprasad Bismil out here.

615
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:10,916
You need a true Indian.

616
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:13,416
How can you find Indian revolutionaries amongst..

617
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:16,500
..people who want to be Westerners?

618
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,208
Ignore him. Let's go.

619
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:23,541
Ramprasad Bismil wished to be reborn a hundred times..

620
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:27,041
..so that he could give his life for his country a hundred times over.

621
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:29,291
Let's go from here Su.

622
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:33,291
So where do you think I can find my Bismil?

623
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:42,833
I don't believe this.

624
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:49,250
'The desire to rebel now fills our hearts'

625
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:55,583
'We have yet to test the strength of the murderer's might'

626
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:59,666
'Why does he not say a word?

627
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:06,458
'The one in my sights has his lips sealed'

628
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:11,458
'O martyrs, O men of valour, I'd give my life for you'

629
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:16,833
'In every lane even the enemy sings your praise these days'

630
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:21,458
'When the time will come, we shall show you, O sky'

631
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:27,041
'What is the point in speaking now of what lies in our hearts?'

632
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:31,208
' They drag us all together in hope of execution'

633
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:35,291
'Those fired by passion are gathered in the murderer's lane'

634
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:40,125
'We have yet to test the strength of the murderer's might'

635
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:47,333
The desire to rebel now fills our hearts

636
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:51,333
' We have yet to test the strength of the murderer's might'

637
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,333
Sue, this isn't London. You don't know what kind..

638
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:09,625
..of scum, men like Laxman Pandey are.

639
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:13,875
Look Sue if he is a part of this, then I can't do the film.

640
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:17,125
If you have any problems with me say it on my face.

641
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:21,416
Don't stab me in the back like a coward.

642
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:24,666
Pandey leave! We don't want trouble..

643
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:28,250
Speak you coward. What were you saying?

644
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:33,541
Aslam, sit here. Where are you going?

645
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:34,916
Bastard, what were you saying?

646
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:38,250
Hey you! How dare you hit Aslam

647
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:39,916
Don't spare him.

648
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:43,583
Sukhi! - Stop it please.. Karan, stop him..

649
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:48,583
Thrash the bastard! Thrash the bastard! Thrash the bastard!

650
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:52,083
Sonia do something.

651
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,708
Hey hit him.. - Stop it..

652
00:52:56,208 --> 00:53:02,541
Stop it.. Stop it.. Stop it.. Stop it before I say..

653
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:04,666
Aslam, do something

654
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:13,083
Stop it.. Stop it.. Stop it.. Stop it before I say.

655
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:20,875
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I took you guys in my film.

656
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:23,458
God knows what made me come here..

657
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:27,500
I was so stupid to pack my bags and come to a place..

658
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,416
..where people are just looking for an excuse to kill each other.

659
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:36,416
Well atleast now you all will have one less excuse.

660
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:25,541
Sue!

661
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:40,541
Sue! Sue, we are sorry.

662
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:43,666
You know we've got a problem with Pandey. There's a lot of bad blood.

663
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:49,291
And if I stay, it's sure to happen again. - No, Sue. I am saying it.

664
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:50,666
We've worked it out.

665
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:54,666
You won't have any problems.

666
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:06,000
Sue.. we all know how much this film means to you.

667
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:11,541
We want to help you finish what you came here to do.

668
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:13,666
Everyone wants you to stay.

669
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:17,666
I want you to stay.

670
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:23,291
Say something..

671
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:27,375
I am scared.

672
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:32,875
Don't worry, you're in safe hands.

673
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,875
Come on.. Get up. ..Come here.

674
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:51,333
"If a girl smiles it means that she is allured.."

675
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:55,375
Hey brother she will stay back. She's not going anywhere.

676
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:59,208
You are a good actor. Now, clean the room.

677
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:02,625
Now just chill. Look at this.

678
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:07,250
The next four weeks were the hardest of my entire life.

679
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:11,250
And the happiest.

680
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,958
God is one. Truth is His name

681
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,333
He is the Creator

682
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:23,208
The Fearless. Without Enmity.

683
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:25,666
The Immortal

684
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:29,833
The Unborn, Self-illuminated

685
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,250
By the grace of the Guru

686
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:33,833
Recite

687
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:35,500
True in the beginning

688
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,291
True before Time

689
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:38,958
True in the present

690
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:44,500
Guru Nanak will be forever true

691
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,666
Thought cannot create Him

692
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:50,875
Even though one may try

693
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:53,916
He cannot be attained through silence

694
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:57,291
Even though meditation is unbroken

695
00:56:57,791 --> 00:57:02,625
The devout's hunger for God can never be satisfied

696
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:06,083
Despite the many worldly riches you may have

697
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:12,791
Use the riches as you will. But none will help you to attain God

698
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:18,000
How shall a man justify himself?

699
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,625
How can the screen of falsehood be torn?

700
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:31,166
Nanak, by abiding the will of God as ordained by Him

701
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:35,166
The Pure belong to God. And Victory is God's alone

702
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:04,458
"Take some soil of my land.."

703
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:13,750
"Take some soil of my land, the scent of this air.."

704
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:18,375
"Add the breath of my being, the throbbing of my heart.."

705
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:24,333
"And the zeal, that races through my blood.."

706
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:28,958
"Take all these, and stir it. Then watch as it brings out the colour"

707
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:33,541
"Take all these, and stir it. Then watch as it brings out the colour"

708
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:36,250
"Watch as it brings out the colour of patriotism, my friend."

709
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:40,208
"Watch as it brings out the colour." ..

710
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:42,750
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

711
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:45,000
"Watch as it brings out the colour.." ..

712
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,333
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

713
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,541
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

714
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:51,875
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

715
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:54,166
"Watch as it brings out the colour.." ..

716
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:56,500
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

717
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,708
"Watch as it brings out the colour.." ..

718
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:00,708
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

719
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,833
"Watch as it brings out the colour.." ..

720
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:07,291
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

721
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:08,916
Bismil's sent a message..

722
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:11,208
..that the Lucknow train..

723
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:14,833
..carrying the Empire's money.. will be looted by us in Kakori..

724
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:17,416
..while eating Kakori kababs.

725
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:20,916
And we will buy bombs with that money. What will we buy? Bombs.

726
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:23,875
Leave her alone.. She will stop giving milk.

727
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:28,416
"Give colour to your dreams. And those of your people."

728
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:33,000
"Give colour to your happiness. And your sadness too."

729
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,416
"Give colour to generations.. Give colour to the field.."

730
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:39,916
"Give colour to the beat of your heart. And that of your music."

731
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:42,333
"Give colour to every cheek. Give colour to your eyes.."

732
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:44,875
"Watch as it brings out the colour of patriotism my friend.."

733
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,500
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

734
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:56,708
"Take some soil of my land, the scent of this air.."

735
00:59:57,208 --> 01:00:01,208
"Add the breath of my being, the throbbing of my heart."

736
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:07,333
"And the zeal, that races through my blood.."

737
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:12,000
"Take all these and stir it. Then watch as it brings out the colour"

738
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,583
"Take all these and stir it. Then watch as it brings out the colour"

739
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:19,208
"Watch as it brings out the colour of patriotism, my friend.."

740
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:21,458
"Watch as it brings out the colour.."

741
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:27,458
Bismil's message and the Train going to Lucknow. Hey Chotu!

742
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:28,833
Did you get Bismil's message?

743
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:30,625
No. - No! Then Listen..

744
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:32,416
The train that is leaving after eight days..

745
01:00:32,916 --> 01:00:34,375
.. we will loot it in Kakori..

746
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:36,500
It's loaded with the Empire's money.

747
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,916
Will you loot it? - No.

748
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:40,750
Oye.. we will be buying arms from it.

749
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,083
What will we buy? - Arms..

750
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:43,708
Yes.. Very Good.. go now.

751
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:48,458
"On a slow fire, won't you, put this passion to cook.."

752
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:53,208
"Then as it simmers, add a babbling brook.." - Let's rock!

753
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:57,625
"Add a river, and an ocean. Maybe a pot of water.."

754
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:00,083
"Then sprinkle a bit. Stir it all up."

755
01:01:00,583 --> 01:01:02,458
"And watch as it brings out the colour.."

756
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:08,750
"Watch as it brings out the colour of patriotism, my friend.."

757
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,125
Bismil has sent a message..

758
01:01:11,625 --> 01:01:12,875
..the Lucknow train..

759
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,875
..which carries the Empire's money..

760
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:18,375
..will be looted by us in seven days, in Kakori..

761
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,583
And we will buy bombs with that money.

762
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:25,166
"Now paint the whole town with it. Paint your very being."

763
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:29,791
"Paint your every vein with it. Paint it with a smile.."

764
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:32,041
"Paint those childhood years, won't you.

765
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:34,291
Paint the flush of youth.."

766
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:38,958
"Don't hesitate, my friend. Paint your patriotism over everything.."

767
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:44,041
"Watch as it brings out the colour of patriotism, my friend.."

768
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:48,583
"Take some soil of my land.."

769
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:57,958
"Take some soil of my land, the scent of this air.."

770
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:02,500
"Add the breath of my being, the throbbing of my heart.."

771
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,541
"And the zeal, that races through my blood.."

772
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:13,250
"Take all these and stir it. Then watch as it brings out the colour"

773
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:20,041
"Watch as it brings out the colour of patriotism, my friend."

774
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:22,416
"Watch as it brings out the colour."

775
01:02:22,916 --> 01:02:24,666
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

776
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:26,541
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

777
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:31,125
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

778
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:37,875
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

779
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:42,583
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

780
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:46,583
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

781
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:56,666
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

782
01:02:57,166 --> 01:03:01,583
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

783
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:06,916
"Watch as it brings out the colour of.."

784
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:18,416
"Watch as it brings out the colour of patriotism, my friend."

785
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:27,541
The Kakori robbery on August 9th 1925 that's where it all started.

786
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:31,541
Nothing would ever be the same after that.

787
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,958
British Officers.. around 20 to 25 of them.

788
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:51,958
We have to call it off! We've nearly reached Kakori.

789
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:55,958
Stop Ashfaq, quick.

790
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:05,166
Ashfaq, stop!

791
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:09,166
It's too late to back out now.. Come on.. Move!

792
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:29,208
Get inside!

793
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:42,625
Keep the windows shut..

794
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:44,833
..no Indian will be hurt..

795
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:46,750
Come on!

796
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,458
The keys! - You won't get away with this.

797
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:52,541
Give me the keys! - I don't have it. I don't have it.

798
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:56,541
Banwari get the sledge-hammer.

799
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:02,291
I'll handle them. You go get the money..

800
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:20,541
Kakori had sent shock waves throughout the establishment.

801
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:23,708
But we had none to blame but ourselves.

802
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:27,708
What we were hearing were the echoes of our own guns.

803
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:42,750
Fire..

804
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:45,958
Load.

805
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:49,958
Fire..

806
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:58,458
Load

807
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:04,166
Fire..

808
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,250
Jallianwala Baug meeting essentially nonviolent people..

809
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,125
..considered taking up arms.

810
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:16,750
This was when Bhagat Singh stepped out of the shadows..

811
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:19,125
..to claim his destiny.

812
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:23,250
I've committed my life to the freedom of this country.

813
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:28,833
Comfort and other worldly desires do not attract me.

814
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:33,125
I know you want me to get married and settle down..

815
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:35,583
..like all parents do.

816
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:39,500
But freedom is my bride.

817
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,208
I hope you'll forgive me. Your most obedient son..

818
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:47,958
Bhagat Singh.

819
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:49,750
Cut.

820
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:53,750
Let's take a break.

821
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:00,750
Breakfast? No..

822
01:08:20,916 --> 01:08:21,541
Put it there.

823
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:29,500
General Dyer? How can one even think of doing something like this?

824
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I can't believe that he actually killed more..

825
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,083
.. than 400 people at Jallianwala Baugh.

826
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:37,250
379.. that was the official figure.

827
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:40,000
Actually nearly 1000 people were butchered..

828
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:44,000
Here.

829
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:53,208
Last year at the tomb of Peer Sai, I prayed for Daljeet's well being.

830
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:54,833
Who's Daljeet?

831
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:58,208
We were the epitome of tolerance.

832
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:01,250
Even an ant reacts. But we are conditioned ..

833
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,666
..to take everything lying down.

834
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:05,375
Rubbish! It's today's generation

835
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:06,833
.. which lacks the will to do anything

836
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:08,708
Have you ever heard of Shaheed Uddham Singh?

837
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:13,083
He went all the way to London and killed that Dyer.

838
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,375
..because he was also a part of the Jallianwala Baugh massacre.

839
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:20,458
Eat it Sonia. The butter will strengthen your bones.

840
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:24,666
In Punjab every mother sends at least one son to the army.

841
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:28,000
Why should we retreat? Sacrifice runs in our blood.

842
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,583
Only idiots like DJ retreat.

843
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,625
Why does it always come back to me?

844
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:35,750
Shut up and eat your paratha. Gollu, bring the lassi.

845
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,791
We are taught from our childhood to adjust our self.

846
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:40,958
Six people sitting on a seat for four..

847
01:09:41,458 --> 01:09:47,125
..someone will squeeze in and say Please adjust!

848
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:51,875
Hey! Why are you adjusting? Come sit, sit.

849
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:58,208
Hey, brother, hey, brother.

850
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:01,416
Strange. Isn't it?

851
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:09,750
We are being hunted like animals in our own country..

852
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:13,625
Ashfaq you should cross the border and get to Afghanistan..

853
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:15,625
We have many Muslim friends there.

854
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:17,625
You will be safe with them.

855
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:19,916
After all you're one of their own.

856
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,125
One of their own? - Hmm..

857
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:26,125
Why am I not one of your own?

858
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,916
Ashfaq.. I never meant..

859
01:10:31,416 --> 01:10:34,875
Ashfaq..

860
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:38,541
I didn't mean to hurt you.

861
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:42,041
This is your country as much as it is mine.

862
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:48,666
You have a right to fight and die for it too..

863
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:51,708
Forgive me. - Ram, let us not talk of dying..

864
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:55,708
I pray that we all live to see our children live in a free country.

865
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:04,750
Ram run!

866
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:05,291
Run.. Run..

867
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:20,125
Where are your other friends?

868
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:24,125
Where's Azad?

869
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:31,083
Azad was not a man to be found easily.

870
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:36,750
A master of disguises appeared and vanished at will.

871
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:39,000
After months of frustration a break through ..

872
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,791
.. came for the British Government.

873
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:46,833
Banwari Lal, weakest of the revolutionaries in captivity.

874
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:50,458
The man who had given us the whereabouts of..

875
01:12:50,958 --> 01:12:54,458
..Bismil and Ashfaqulla agreed to be the bait to trap Azad.

876
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,000
Banwari!

877
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:17,541
Okay! "Just make an eye to eye contact and learn.."

878
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,500
I loved those songs and dances.

879
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,791
That's the reason we make films in this country.. to dance.

880
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,458
Hey, you Hollywood's relative.

881
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:29,000
"Just make an eye contact.."

882
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,541
So where are we going? - Yes, where are we going?

883
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:34,250
Hello! Where?

884
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:38,250
Special day, special place! - Special Day?

885
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:52,791
It's amazing. - Isn't it?

886
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:57,833
Ever since I was a kid I used to come here..

887
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:01,041
..to watch planes take off.. and watch ..

888
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:05,041
.. them till they don't disappear in the sky.

889
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:37,958
These guys have gone crazy!

890
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:40,375
Come on, face it, you'd love to do that really.

891
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:42,791
What? Take my shirt off and howl at planes.

892
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:45,541
I won't mind if you do.

893
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:49,541
Dream on buddy..

894
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:56,916
Hey, Wild people. - Boys and girls and ..

895
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:58,791
.. Sukhi who is always after girls..

896
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:00,083
Why me all the time?

897
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:03,500
I want to make a special announcement..

898
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,250
Ma'am, I was wondering if you'd like to ..

899
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:12,250
.. spend the rest of your life with me..

900
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:20,291
Will you please marry me?

901
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:28,250
This is a real love.

902
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:32,250
"Ajay has done it.." "Ajay has done it.."

903
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:20,500
"Without saying a word, you steal my heart."

904
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:28,541
"I'll find happiness by your..

905
01:18:29,041 --> 01:18:37,583
..side I can't stay apart."

906
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:52,166
"My life tastes sweet now..

907
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:59,583
..since you walked..

908
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:08,625
.. through that door."

909
01:19:09,125 --> 01:19:16,500
"When your arms wrap around me..

910
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:25,583
..I know I've found my shore."

911
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:32,500
"Without saying a word..

912
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,500
..you steal my heart."

913
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:15,750
"Sweep through the streets of..

914
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:25,250
..my mind Like a gentle spring."

915
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:31,666
"Walk through the corridors of my heart..

916
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:40,250
..fill the caravan of my dreams."

917
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:47,583
"I sway to the song..

918
01:20:48,083 --> 01:20:57,375
..of your soul."

919
01:20:57,875 --> 01:21:04,125
"Without saying a word..

920
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:12,291
..you steal my heart."

921
01:21:12,791 --> 01:21:20,041
"I'll find happiness by your side..

922
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:24,041
..I can't stay apart."

923
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:48,041
The first thing that hit me about this man was his voice.

924
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:52,041
I knew then my job was not going to be easy.

925
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:54,041
I'll come back later.

926
01:21:54,541 --> 01:22:01,333
My prayers won't stop till my country gets its freedom.

927
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:05,291
I don't think you can wait till then.

928
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:11,333
My name is James McKinley. I'm here to find out from you..

929
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:15,166
..where Azad and the other terrorists are hiding.

930
01:22:15,666 --> 01:22:19,166
Not terrorists. Revolutionaries. Call them Revolutionaries.

931
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:42,208
Breaking a man bit by bit, they said it would get easier by time.

932
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:46,208
It never did.

933
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:23,833
The torture went on for sometime but Bismil didn't break.

934
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:27,833
Also Ashfaq.

935
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:35,041
Both men had made pain their friend, they didn't break.

936
01:23:35,541 --> 01:23:38,083
Instead they did something that I had never ..

937
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:42,083
.. seen any prisoner do before.

938
01:23:56,375 --> 01:24:00,500
Death cannot take you Ashfaq..

939
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,750
.. live in people's hearts and minds.

940
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:10,041
..as the torture tore their bodies apart.

941
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:15,125
I think it was the poetry that held their souls together..

942
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:19,583
The torture didn't work so we thought of other ways.

943
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:23,875
This is the Holy Quran.

944
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:28,750
Hindus like Bismil will create a country for themselves.

945
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:32,250
They're just using you.

946
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,125
He's not fighting for Hindu freedom, ..

947
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:37,416
.. he's fighting for Hindustan's freedom.

948
01:24:37,916 --> 01:24:41,333
But you won't be able to understand this.

949
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:45,333
You've been a slave so long you've begun to like it.

950
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:55,541
Tell us where Azad and the other terrorists are..

951
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:59,541
..You can still save yourself.

952
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:08,083
19 December.

953
01:25:08,583 --> 01:25:11,458
It's not your fault, Mr. McKinley..

954
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:14,416
..you're only doing your duty.

955
01:25:14,916 --> 01:25:19,041
How can I stay loyal?

956
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:23,458
Tell me..

957
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:28,083
Tell me.

958
01:25:28,583 --> 01:25:32,083
How can this be the will of God?

959
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:48,125
Things have become harder for me.

960
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:54,333
I have not been made to kill these people.

961
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:11,458
Hey, hey guys what's up?

962
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:18,208
What's wrong? Did someone die?

963
01:27:18,708 --> 01:27:23,041
Sue.. I haven't seen these guys so serious.

964
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:25,541
What are you doing to my friends?

965
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:31,333
It's not me.. it's them. They've really begun to get into this.

966
01:27:31,833 --> 01:27:34,041
Hey Laxman, aren't you coming along?

967
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:35,666
No. Some other time.

968
01:27:36,166 --> 01:27:38,083
Come on. It's my last night in town.

969
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:39,916
I'm not really hungry.

970
01:27:40,416 --> 01:27:45,000
Watch us eat then. Come on.

971
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:49,000
Come on.

972
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:03,375
To two lovebirds.. may they always be happy.

973
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:10,291
May the insanity and romance never die. Cheers.

974
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:14,750
I said cheers guys. - Cheers. Cheers.. Cheers..

975
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:17,125
I'm insane only about two things in my life.

976
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:20,541
Sonia and flying.

977
01:28:21,041 --> 01:28:28,291
"What is my heart, take also my life.."

978
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:33,625
You're lucky to feel so passionately about something.

979
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:36,125
You have your poetry Aslam.

980
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:38,875
Just like DJ has his singing.

981
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:40,041
Everyone has passion for something inside ..

982
01:28:40,541 --> 01:28:41,416
.. them, they just have to find this 'thing'.

983
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:43,750
Just like our revolutionaries..

984
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:45,458
..their passion for freedom was greater than ..

985
01:28:45,958 --> 01:28:47,333
.. their love for their own lives.

986
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:52,583
There's nothing in this world worth giving your life for. Nothing!

987
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:55,458
Correct, except Umrao Jaan.

988
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:58,958
Just once.. - Repeat.

989
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:00,416
Easy DJ..

990
01:29:00,916 --> 01:29:02,458
Yes mama.

991
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:06,000
Come on Karan, there are things worth giving your life for Karan.

992
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,625
Please.

993
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:09,291
Like what? Look at Bhagat Singh and Azad ..

994
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:10,833
.. and the rest of those guys.

995
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:12,791
They gave their lives for this country.

996
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:16,125
Look what happened. All for nothing.

997
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:21,791
It's a shit-hole today. Does any one care about them?

998
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:23,291
I give a shit.

999
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:27,291
People like Ajay who fight for their country give a shit.

1000
01:29:27,791 --> 01:29:29,666
So that people like you can sleep peacefully.

1001
01:29:30,166 --> 01:29:34,166
Give life. - Sonia get real.

1002
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:35,750
Sonia's right.

1003
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:39,750
Sue, it's all-fine for a foreigner like you to say all this..

1004
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:44,500
Out here we're fighting for basics..

1005
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,375
..food, clothing and shelter.

1006
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:50,583
Out here you try to change things you'll get even more screwed.

1007
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:54,541
Corruption is in our DNA.

1008
01:29:55,041 --> 01:29:56,375
There is no future for this country.

1009
01:29:56,875 --> 01:30:01,000
She's talking about the past, you're thinking about the future..

1010
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,583
One leg in the past and one leg in the future..

1011
01:30:04,083 --> 01:30:05,958
..that's why we're pissing on the present..

1012
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:09,958
DJ just shut up. For once in life get serious.

1013
01:30:14,291 --> 01:30:19,875
Karan, it's easy to sit on the outside and be a critic..

1014
01:30:20,375 --> 01:30:23,750
..blaming others is even easier.

1015
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:25,666
If you have so many problems then why ..

1016
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:27,250
.. don't you go out there and change things?

1017
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:29,375
This is your country too.

1018
01:30:29,875 --> 01:30:34,500
Join politics, the police force, government and clean it up.

1019
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,291
But you won't! I'll tell you why..

1020
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:45,000
Because that takes hard work. It's easier to crib.

1021
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:48,500
If you have dare then try yourself to change this country.

1022
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,375
Nothing's going to change.

1023
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:54,625
You can go to your grave trying.. it won't make any difference.

1024
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:59,833
Correct.. the only difference will be how you go to your grave..

1025
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:03,875
DJ Releax. - I am relaxed.

1026
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:11,541
I'm not drunk. Am I drunk Sue? - No.

1027
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:18,375
See, the director's word is final. Cut it!

1028
01:31:18,875 --> 01:31:21,708
Where were we?

1029
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:23,375
On the way to our graves.

1030
01:31:23,875 --> 01:31:30,708
Yes, we all will be carried in the same style to our graves.

1031
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:35,125
We'll all be wrapped in white shrouds when we die.

1032
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:40,041
Only Ajay will be wrapped in the national flag. - DJ stop it.

1033
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:43,916
Karan, you can say whatever you want,

1034
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:48,666
Not even the street dogs will bark when we die.

1035
01:31:49,166 --> 01:31:52,666
But Ajay will get a 21 gun salute.

1036
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:09,500
Left, Right. Left, Right. Left, Right..

1037
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,083
What are you doing? - Attention! - Attention!

1038
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:18,083
1Move forward! - Move forward.

1039
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:35,250
Karan, this is for you.

1040
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,208
For me? Thanks dude.

1041
01:32:37,708 --> 01:32:39,458
The girls fall for him anyway..

1042
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:41,125
If anyone deserves the jacket, it's me.

1043
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:44,541
Wow! What a dutiful daughter-in-law.

1044
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:48,666
Now you see, she will touch her f fianc's feet.

1045
01:32:49,166 --> 01:32:52,708
DJ's right. Touch my feet, madam.

1046
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:54,833
Come on. - Stupid.

1047
01:32:55,333 --> 01:32:59,000
See what women in this country have to put up with?

1048
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:03,208
I think DJ's right. You should respect your traditions.

1049
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:04,833
See, even Sue agrees..

1050
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:06,750
.. a woman's place is at her husband's feet.

1051
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:10,833
Honey, you should know it. - I see.

1052
01:33:11,333 --> 01:33:16,666
Mother.. Mother..

1053
01:33:17,166 --> 01:33:18,583
These two can be such children.

1054
01:33:19,083 --> 01:33:22,416
They spend half their time fighting. The other half making up.

1055
01:33:22,916 --> 01:33:25,875
Sweetie-pie, can't you stay a while longer?

1056
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:29,333
No, I have to go..

1057
01:33:29,833 --> 01:33:35,666
Sweetie - Pie! Sweetie - Pie! - Shut up guys.

1058
01:33:36,166 --> 01:33:40,416
"Don't go dear leaving me behind..

1059
01:33:40,916 --> 01:33:45,416
..I swear I will cry.. " - Shut up yaar..

1060
01:33:45,916 --> 01:33:48,500
I know how Sonia must be feeling right now..

1061
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,625
.. my father was also in the army.

1062
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:53,666
I used to think that way too..

1063
01:33:54,166 --> 01:33:56,875
when Ajay's father and I first got married an Air-force pilot's wife.

1064
01:33:57,375 --> 01:34:00,375
You realize that..

1065
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:06,750
..your husband has pledged his life for the country.

1066
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:10,750
Whether you like it or not you have to accept it.

1067
01:34:20,875 --> 01:34:26,208
I'm so happy Ajay's chosen a girl like you..

1068
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:29,125
.. now I can die in peace. - Don't talk nonsense Ma.

1069
01:34:29,625 --> 01:34:33,833
You'll have many more years.. and a dozen grandchildren too.

1070
01:34:34,333 --> 01:34:35,708
Grandchildren? First you've got to stay home..

1071
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:39,708
.. long enough to make them, dude.

1072
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:14,166
"The bugle sounds, the enemy wakes. The battle is upon us.. "

1073
01:35:14,666 --> 01:35:17,750
"And in our hearts, we feel the swell, of..

1074
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:21,541
.. pride and steel and valour.. "

1075
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:24,208
"For we will play the game of blood, if..

1076
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:28,791
.. dark clouds shroud our land.. "

1077
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:31,916
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1078
01:35:32,416 --> 01:35:35,041
.. and laugh at its pale spectre.. "

1079
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:37,583
"We will not fear those cruel swords..

1080
01:35:38,083 --> 01:35:40,000
.. our courage is far sharper.. "

1081
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:46,250
"We will not fear those cruel swords..

1082
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:54,791
.. our courage is far sharper.. "

1083
01:35:55,291 --> 01:36:02,041
"We will not fear those cruel swords..

1084
01:36:02,541 --> 01:36:09,416
"For let them know, their cowardly deeds..

1085
01:36:09,916 --> 01:36:14,375
.. , just serve to stoke our fires.. "

1086
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:19,416
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1087
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:25,500
.. and laugh at its pale spectre.. "

1088
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,375
"We bade farewell, to this day, knowing it could be our last.. "

1089
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:35,208
"We swore to play, with our lives, never waver in our task.. "

1090
01:36:35,708 --> 01:36:37,791
"For we are but the last, few guests..

1091
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:40,166
.. served at fate's great banquet.. "

1092
01:36:40,666 --> 01:36:42,625
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1093
01:36:43,125 --> 01:36:45,000
.. and laugh at its pale spectre.. "

1094
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,583
"We cannot quell, the raging storm, the spirit of revolution.. "

1095
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:50,041
"For it now courses in our veins, like lava truly molten.. "

1096
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:55,041
"We will teach them, the twin lessons, of fear and fortitude.. "

1097
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:57,458
"Our goal cannot now hide for long..

1098
01:36:57,958 --> 01:36:59,791
.. when courage is our beacon."

1099
01:37:00,291 --> 01:37:02,291
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1100
01:37:02,791 --> 01:37:05,833
.. and laugh at its pale spectre.. "

1101
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:08,750
"Because this day, we walk with death..

1102
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:10,541
The entire country is in the deep state of mourning..

1103
01:37:11,041 --> 01:37:12,833
.. because of the demise of Lala Lajpat Rai.

1104
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:15,833
Just before dying he said, "Every blow rendered on me is the..

1105
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:23,708
.. is the nail imbedded in the coffin of the British imperialism.

1106
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:29,291
It was the calm before the storm.

1107
01:37:29,791 --> 01:37:32,833
We have to take drastic measures.

1108
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:36,666
What drastic measures?

1109
01:37:37,166 --> 01:37:40,666
Kill him.

1110
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:04,958
C'mon..

1111
01:38:29,208 --> 01:38:33,458
Bhagat run! Quick!

1112
01:38:33,958 --> 01:38:37,458
Hey go away from here. We don't want to kill any Hindustani.

1113
01:38:55,791 --> 01:38:59,041
And the days that followed Azad, Bhagat Singh..

1114
01:38:59,541 --> 01:39:00,833
and the others went missing.

1115
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:03,750
This was the period when they coined two words..

1116
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:07,625
.. 'Inquilab Zindabad'

1117
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:09,375
Inquilab Zindabad - "Long live the revolution".

1118
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:11,541
Two words that became the slogan for..

1119
01:39:12,041 --> 01:39:15,541
.. the Indian freedom movement.

1120
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:21,208
Great idea!

1121
01:39:21,708 --> 01:39:23,458
But Bhagat, escaping will be impossible.

1122
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:28,041
Our main mission is to get caught.. not escape.

1123
01:39:28,541 --> 01:39:29,500
What?

1124
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,291
If we get caught there will be a trial..

1125
01:39:31,791 --> 01:39:35,875
.. we'll get a chance to speak.

1126
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:39,875
We'll be heard.

1127
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,625
But if they catch us, they'll hang us for certain.

1128
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:50,791
I know.

1129
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:54,791
But it takes a loud noise to open deaf ears.

1130
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:03,166
Long live the revolution!

1131
01:40:03,666 --> 01:40:05,625
They were only smoke bombs, intended to..

1132
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:08,666
.. awaken England from her dreams.

1133
01:40:09,166 --> 01:40:12,666
And they had more than achieved their task.

1134
01:40:22,875 --> 01:40:32,125
"Feel the unrest sweep through the land.. "

1135
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:42,208
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest."

1136
01:40:42,708 --> 01:40:52,000
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest."

1137
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,500
"The embers, they are burning.. "

1138
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
"The tide, it's turning. You can feel the winds of change.. "

1139
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:01,000
"Feel the unrest sweep through the land Feel the unrest.. "

1140
01:41:12,916 --> 01:41:15,500
We are prisoners.. political prisoners..

1141
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,875
.. we should be allowed books.. writing material..

1142
01:41:19,375 --> 01:41:22,166
.. and at least one daily newspaper.

1143
01:41:22,666 --> 01:41:26,166
We will not eat till then. The hunger strike will continue.

1144
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:45,791
The fast and the torture went on for 114 days. 114 days!

1145
01:41:46,291 --> 01:41:48,125
Never before in the history of any revolution..

1146
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:49,333
.. had anyone lasted so long.

1147
01:41:49,833 --> 01:41:56,250
In such inhumane conditions we could crush these young boys..

1148
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:58,791
.. but we could not crush their souls.

1149
01:41:59,291 --> 01:42:05,708
"Our words won't falter now, We will speak our mind.. "

1150
01:42:06,208 --> 01:42:11,625
"We won't back down now. Our dreams we won't leave behind.. "

1151
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:15,625
"We won't let the storm die. Injustice we will defy.. "

1152
01:42:28,791 --> 01:42:33,250
"You can feel it possess you now. Feel it, your soul claim.. "

1153
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:38,208
"You can feel it possess you now. Feel it, your soul claim.. "

1154
01:42:38,708 --> 01:42:40,750
"Drink this spirit in one long swallow.

1155
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:43,166
Feel it course through your veins.. "

1156
01:42:43,666 --> 01:42:48,083
"Let the celebrations begin now. Feel your body sway.. "

1157
01:42:48,583 --> 01:42:53,333
"In every breath feel more alive. To keep the storm at bay.. "

1158
01:42:53,833 --> 01:42:55,958
"See the unrest in those eyes. See it all around.. "

1159
01:42:56,458 --> 01:43:03,458
"See it in the air, my friend. And in those hearts, abound.. "

1160
01:43:03,958 --> 01:43:06,041
"See the unrest in those eyes. See it all around.. "

1161
01:43:06,541 --> 01:43:10,041
"See it in the air, my friend. And in those hearts, abound.. "

1162
01:43:23,625 --> 01:43:30,500
"We are engulfed in the shadows But we will come out brighter.. "

1163
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,125
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest.. "

1164
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:40,375
"We are engulfed in the shadows. But we will come out brighter.. "

1165
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:43,083
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest.. "

1166
01:43:43,583 --> 01:43:53,500
"Feel the unrest. Feel the unrest.. "

1167
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,500
"Injustice we will defy.. "

1168
01:44:00,958 --> 01:44:03,541
Pretty nice huh? Very pretty.

1169
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:07,541
I like these ones, I think I'll buy them.

1170
01:44:11,416 --> 01:44:14,375
This is not an animal.

1171
01:44:14,875 --> 01:44:17,541
In breaking news today..

1172
01:44:18,041 --> 01:44:22,125
.. a MIG-21 fighter plane has just crashed..

1173
01:44:22,625 --> 01:44:25,333
.. this is the second such crash in the past six months..

1174
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:29,250
The Defence Ministry has ordered an investigation into the crash.

1175
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:32,791
We have just received news that the pilot..

1176
01:44:33,291 --> 01:44:37,875
.. Flight Lieutenant Ajay Rathod has died in the crash.

1177
01:44:38,375 --> 01:44:41,541
Flight Lt Rathod apparently did not eject from the burning plane..

1178
01:44:42,041 --> 01:44:45,791
Instead he steered it and crashed it in an open field.

1179
01:44:46,291 --> 01:44:49,833
Thus saving many lives

1180
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:52,416
Viewers may recall..

1181
01:44:52,916 --> 01:44:56,083
.. that until now, 163 MiG-21 of IAF have crashed..

1182
01:44:56,583 --> 01:45:00,083
.. and 66 pilots have lost their lives.

1183
01:46:15,958 --> 01:46:19,916
"This game of hide and seek has gone on too long..

1184
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:24,708
.. come home now, won't you."

1185
01:46:25,208 --> 01:46:29,208
"I've searched high and low."

1186
01:46:29,708 --> 01:46:35,708
"These old eyes are weary so, come home now won't you.. "

1187
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:40,208
"Dusk is spreading like the ache in my heart..

1188
01:46:40,708 --> 01:46:48,333
.. my vision blurs, come home now won't you."

1189
01:46:48,833 --> 01:46:57,458
"I'm in a place you wouldn't believe Ma."

1190
01:46:57,958 --> 01:47:06,750
"Endless skies I can soar."

1191
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:11,291
"Just like your fairy tales, it's filled with dreams."

1192
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:15,583
"A sea of hope with no shore."

1193
01:47:16,083 --> 01:47:24,583
"My soul flies here, like a kite without fear.

1194
01:47:25,083 --> 01:47:32,958
No one to cut my strings, no more."

1195
01:47:33,458 --> 01:47:38,666
Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod stayed in the plane until the very end..

1196
01:47:39,166 --> 01:47:43,291
.. and steered the plane clear of Ambala city.

1197
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:50,583
Thereby saving many lives. But Lt. Rathod

1198
01:47:51,083 --> 01:47:52,875
.. had to give away his life.

1199
01:47:53,375 --> 01:47:54,916
In the last 10 years over 100 MIG-21..

1200
01:47:55,416 --> 01:47:56,750
.. aircrafts of the IAF have crashed..

1201
01:47:57,250 --> 01:48:01,208
.. in which over 30 pilots have lost their lives.

1202
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:03,500
Defence Minister Shastri, the CAG report..

1203
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:04,916
.. states that old and defective..

1204
01:48:05,416 --> 01:48:08,833
.. Russian spare parts were procured by the government.

1205
01:48:09,333 --> 01:48:12,375
Isn't this a case of high-level corruption?

1206
01:48:12,875 --> 01:48:14,750
Not at all. I've personally clarified..

1207
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:18,333
.. the issue in the parliament.

1208
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:20,375
This is a downright lie.

1209
01:48:20,875 --> 01:48:22,291
The youngsters of today are brash and..

1210
01:48:22,791 --> 01:48:23,625
.. irresponsible when it comes to flying planes.

1211
01:48:24,125 --> 01:48:26,000
No! I don't agree..

1212
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,625
Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod was an ace pilot..

1213
01:48:29,125 --> 01:48:30,833
.. who I trained..

1214
01:48:31,333 --> 01:48:35,000
He was a gold medalist. The youngest to clear night sorties.

1215
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:38,000
With over 1000 flying hours..

1216
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,958
This can't be the record of an irresponsible pilot.

1217
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:44,000
Defence Minister, how many more pilots..

1218
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:47,041
.. will you send to their graves..

1219
01:48:47,541 --> 01:48:49,458
.. before you stop the rot in the system?

1220
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:51,583
Will all our boys die the same way?

1221
01:48:52,083 --> 01:48:55,083
We are talking about the one..

1222
01:48:55,583 --> 01:49:04,166
"If only I could show you this place, Ma."

1223
01:49:04,666 --> 01:49:13,458
"Here waterfalls are made of rainbows."

1224
01:49:13,958 --> 01:49:18,083
"There are no roses just bouquets of dreams Ma."

1225
01:49:18,583 --> 01:49:22,583
"Their scent, no flower can hope for."

1226
01:49:23,083 --> 01:49:27,375
"Here sunlight and shadow walk hand in hand."

1227
01:49:27,875 --> 01:49:31,958
"Everything seems bright and new."

1228
01:49:32,458 --> 01:49:36,583
"But what is heaven, and all its wonders,

1229
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:42,166
.. when Ma, I don't have you."

1230
01:49:42,666 --> 01:49:45,583
From now on, the government will make sure that..

1231
01:49:46,083 --> 01:49:51,125
.. only experienced pilots are given access to these machines..

1232
01:49:51,625 --> 01:49:57,666
.. and not to rash pilots like Ajay Rathod.

1233
01:49:58,166 --> 01:49:59,666
What the hell is he talking about!

1234
01:50:00,166 --> 01:50:03,666
I welcome any investigation. I have nothing to hide.

1235
01:50:08,708 --> 01:50:12,875
This damn MIG investigation shouldn't take us down.

1236
01:50:13,375 --> 01:50:20,375
Relax Sir. Public memory is short. Besides, we'll handle things.

1237
01:50:20,875 --> 01:50:26,083
Dead pilots, live very long in the news.

1238
01:50:26,583 --> 01:50:30,083
But then, they join the forces to sacrifice their lives. Don't they?

1239
01:51:38,375 --> 01:51:40,583
The situation is tense at the moment.

1240
01:51:41,083 --> 01:51:43,250
There is growing anger and discontent.

1241
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:44,750
Directed largely towards the government..

1242
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:47,625
.. especially the Defence Minister.

1243
01:51:48,125 --> 01:51:51,625
We have with us Ajay Rathod's mother..

1244
01:51:53,916 --> 01:51:56,708
The government can't wash its hand off the issue like this.

1245
01:51:57,208 --> 01:51:59,791
They are answerable to the public.

1246
01:52:00,291 --> 01:52:02,666
If the MIG spare parts were of doubtful quality..

1247
01:52:03,166 --> 01:52:09,791
.. why were they bought in the first place?

1248
01:52:10,291 --> 01:52:14,000
MIG's can be made again.. But our children..

1249
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:18,541
.. cannot be brought back..

1250
01:52:19,041 --> 01:52:23,458
It is very clear, the Defence Minister is morally responsible.

1251
01:52:23,958 --> 01:52:25,375
He has to resign.

1252
01:52:25,875 --> 01:52:29,250
It looks like the veil has been pulled off the Defence scam.

1253
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:32,625
But how much will be revealed?

1254
01:52:33,125 --> 01:52:39,041
Mishra, what's happening?

1255
01:52:39,541 --> 01:52:43,041
Our Defence minister says that Ajay Rathod was a novice but..

1256
01:52:53,208 --> 01:52:55,875
.. he didn't let his plane crash into the town.

1257
01:52:56,375 --> 01:53:03,541
When it developed a snag he didn't try to save his life.

1258
01:53:04,041 --> 01:53:07,250
He didn't try to save his life.

1259
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:13,750
He steered it clear of Ambala.. saving thousands of civilians.

1260
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:20,791
Yet the Defence Minister calls him rash.

1261
01:53:21,291 --> 01:53:25,125
We want to ask a question that how many of the minister's..

1262
01:53:25,625 --> 01:53:29,125
.. children's are in army.

1263
01:53:39,625 --> 01:53:43,875
I'm not moving.. this is for Ajay.

1264
01:53:44,375 --> 01:53:46,041
This could turn ugly Aunty.

1265
01:53:46,541 --> 01:53:50,041
Let it.

1266
01:54:12,041 --> 01:54:16,333
"Our blood is raging. It's flowing through the streets."..

1267
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:19,375
.. "But it won't go in vain"

1268
01:54:19,875 --> 01:54:27,458
"Our eyes are blood shot for a purpose. A cause we will attain."

1269
01:54:27,958 --> 01:54:35,166
"It fell from our bodies, embraced the earth."

1270
01:54:35,666 --> 01:54:40,458
"Went winding through streets. A river of courage"

1271
01:54:40,958 --> 01:54:44,958
"It surged and swept."

1272
01:54:45,458 --> 01:54:48,958
"It flowed to make a new beginning" "Our blood raging.. "

1273
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:15,000
"From gaping wounds, and gashes large,"

1274
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:22,375
"It oozed, slowly and steadily."

1275
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:30,583
"While the pointing fingers, got fists in reply,"

1276
01:55:31,083 --> 01:55:40,000
"Yet, our blood was raging"

1277
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:48,000
"It flowed not in vain but with a purpose."

1278
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:56,041
"Our eyes are blood shot for a purpose."

1279
01:55:56,541 --> 01:56:03,791
"It fell from our bodies, embraced the earth."

1280
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:09,125
"Our blood is ranging. It's flowing through the streets."

1281
01:56:09,625 --> 01:56:13,500
"It surged and swept."

1282
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,375
"It flowed to make a new beginning"

1283
01:56:18,875 --> 01:56:23,958
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1284
01:56:24,458 --> 01:56:27,916
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1285
01:56:28,416 --> 01:56:31,833
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1286
01:56:32,333 --> 01:56:35,791
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1287
01:56:36,291 --> 01:56:39,750
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1288
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:43,625
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1289
01:56:44,125 --> 01:56:47,625
"Yet, our blood was raging."

1290
01:57:03,875 --> 01:57:04,875
Someone get a doctor! Immediately!

1291
01:57:05,375 --> 01:57:06,291
Take her to emergency ward. - Yes doctor.

1292
01:57:06,791 --> 01:57:09,750
Fast.

1293
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:13,750
Please stay here. I'll take care of patient. Please.

1294
01:57:20,208 --> 01:57:23,708
Greetings!

1295
01:57:33,583 --> 01:57:37,541
They were beating up innocent people..

1296
01:57:38,041 --> 01:57:40,166
Why didn't you stop them?

1297
01:57:40,666 --> 01:57:42,375
You protested against the government, our own party..

1298
01:57:42,875 --> 01:57:44,208
The protest was not against the party..

1299
01:57:44,708 --> 01:57:46,791
The protest was not against the party..

1300
01:57:47,291 --> 01:57:50,541
.. it was for the truth.

1301
01:57:51,041 --> 01:57:53,708
So many pilots have died..

1302
01:57:54,208 --> 01:57:55,791
.. young boys who were fighting for our country.. killed..

1303
01:57:56,291 --> 01:58:01,583
.. so that someone in the government could make money.

1304
01:58:02,083 --> 01:58:04,875
And our party office doesn't do a thing about it.

1305
01:58:05,375 --> 01:58:08,875
Come.. Sit down.

1306
01:58:11,625 --> 01:58:15,125
Have some tea.

1307
01:58:19,083 --> 01:58:22,291
Don't be so emotional.

1308
01:58:22,791 --> 01:58:26,083
In politics there's no place for emotions.

1309
01:58:26,583 --> 01:58:29,333
We have big plans for you.

1310
01:58:29,833 --> 01:58:31,750
You have to go further. - I don't want to go anywhere.

1311
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:37,625
Only dogs salivate when you show them bone Mishraji.

1312
01:58:38,125 --> 01:58:43,958
Beat him.. Beat him..

1313
01:58:44,458 --> 01:58:47,958
Beat him.. Beat him..

1314
01:59:08,041 --> 01:59:09,333
How's Aunty?

1315
01:59:09,833 --> 01:59:13,333
They're doing an MRI. We are waiting.

1316
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:32,541
I am sorry, she's slipped into a coma.

1317
01:59:33,041 --> 01:59:38,708
Severe skull damage, coupled with the shock of her son's death.

1318
01:59:39,208 --> 01:59:43,041
That's an ugly gash. You need attention.

1319
01:59:43,541 --> 01:59:44,333
Nothing will happen to mother.

1320
01:59:44,833 --> 01:59:47,458
If you need anything, I am there.

1321
01:59:47,958 --> 01:59:51,458
Aslam.. How's he?

1322
01:59:54,666 --> 01:59:58,166
What have you come for? Haven't you done enough damage?

1323
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:04,000
Uncle, it isn't what you think.

1324
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:10,500
I'm not interested in what you think and what you want to do..

1325
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,875
I'm just going to say this once.

1326
02:00:13,375 --> 02:00:15,875
Aslam doesn't know what is good or bad for him.

1327
02:00:16,375 --> 02:00:17,083
He's an emotional boy, always has been.

1328
02:00:17,583 --> 02:00:20,458
He listens to his heart, not his head.

1329
02:00:20,958 --> 02:00:23,958
These are bad times, for people like us.

1330
02:00:24,458 --> 02:00:29,625
Don't take him down with you.

1331
02:00:30,125 --> 02:00:33,625
Go on.. He's inside.

1332
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:51,875
Guddu, go out.

1333
02:00:52,375 --> 02:00:55,500
All parts working?

1334
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,750
Don't make me laugh, idiot. It hurts

1335
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:02,125
How's aunty?

1336
02:01:02,625 --> 02:01:06,833
She's in a coma. - Oh God!

1337
02:01:07,333 --> 02:01:10,833
How can this be happening to us?

1338
02:01:22,041 --> 02:01:23,208
Some dinner?

1339
02:01:23,708 --> 02:01:26,500
No, don't worry Aunty.

1340
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,500
We just came to see Aslam.

1341
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,666
We've got to get back to the hospital.

1342
02:01:31,166 --> 02:01:33,416
Take care.

1343
02:01:33,916 --> 02:01:36,916
See you. Take care.

1344
02:01:37,416 --> 02:01:40,916
Take care.

1345
02:01:56,750 --> 02:02:01,083
Listen.. I..

1346
02:02:01,583 --> 02:02:05,083
I always.. I'm sorry.

1347
02:03:08,958 --> 02:03:12,458
Please eat.

1348
02:03:33,041 --> 02:03:37,250
Everything's falling apart..

1349
02:03:37,750 --> 02:03:41,250
.. and all I can do is stand and watch.

1350
02:03:46,750 --> 02:03:50,250
People like us don't count out here.

1351
02:03:54,333 --> 02:04:00,791
A hundred more Ajay's can die and nothing will change.

1352
02:04:01,291 --> 02:04:04,791
..and nothing will change.

1353
02:04:32,791 --> 02:04:36,291
Ajay did everything right, all his life.. yet..

1354
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:47,833
.. he was a good pilot, a good friend, a good son..

1355
02:04:48,333 --> 02:04:54,416
.. he never harmed a soul, he never did anything wrong.

1356
02:04:54,916 --> 02:04:59,875
.. he didn't deserve this.. Everything is over suddenly.

1357
02:05:00,375 --> 02:05:03,875
.. Sonia didn't deserve this..

1358
02:05:17,208 --> 02:05:22,333
As I watched DJ sleep that night a funny thought occurred to me..

1359
02:05:22,833 --> 02:05:25,125
.. may be DJ wasn't sleeping.

1360
02:05:25,625 --> 02:05:29,125
May be none of them were. May be they were all waking up.

1361
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:14,541
Hey Karan.. they've spoilt your jacket.

1362
02:06:15,041 --> 02:06:18,541
Long live India!

1363
02:06:48,541 --> 02:06:51,625
The bastard got away with it again.

1364
02:06:52,125 --> 02:06:54,666
What can we do..

1365
02:06:55,166 --> 02:06:59,625
..when the law of the land protects people like the Defence Minister.

1366
02:07:00,125 --> 02:07:03,666
We have to take drastic measures.

1367
02:07:04,166 --> 02:07:06,000
What drastic measures?

1368
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:10,958
What do you want to do?

1369
02:07:11,458 --> 02:07:14,541
Kill him.

1370
02:07:15,041 --> 02:07:16,375
What?

1371
02:07:16,875 --> 02:07:21,000
Kill the Defence Minister! Have you lost your mind?

1372
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:22,833
We aren't killers Sonia.

1373
02:07:23,333 --> 02:07:24,541
But they are.

1374
02:07:25,041 --> 02:07:26,166
Have you lost it Karan!

1375
02:07:26,666 --> 02:07:29,125
It's not a blood lust..

1376
02:07:29,625 --> 02:07:30,541
.. it's a matter of justice.

1377
02:07:31,041 --> 02:07:32,208
I'll get the gun.

1378
02:07:32,708 --> 02:07:34,833
Don't instigate, Pandey. We can't start killing..

1379
02:07:35,333 --> 02:07:37,625
.. people for any small reason.

1380
02:07:38,125 --> 02:07:41,083
You think Ajay's death is a small reason? - Karan, Karan.

1381
02:07:41,583 --> 02:07:43,000
Ajay's mother is a small reason?

1382
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:46,291
It is not the matter. Understand me.

1383
02:07:46,791 --> 02:07:48,791
Lala Lajpat Rai's death has to be avenged.

1384
02:07:49,291 --> 02:07:50,541
Scott has to be killed.

1385
02:07:51,041 --> 02:07:54,541
But..

1386
02:08:01,250 --> 02:08:06,541
I always thought we didn't believe in anything.

1387
02:08:07,041 --> 02:08:10,541
So did I. Until now.

1388
02:08:20,916 --> 02:08:22,083
You're insane.

1389
02:08:22,583 --> 02:08:26,083
We can get him in the morning while he jogs.

1390
02:08:29,458 --> 02:08:33,458
Who's we, huh? Who's going to pull the trigger?

1391
02:08:33,958 --> 02:08:37,625
I'll do it!

1392
02:08:38,125 --> 02:08:39,958
There's less security in the morning.

1393
02:08:40,458 --> 02:08:42,250
There's a chance of getting caught.

1394
02:08:42,750 --> 02:08:46,250
No matter what we'll have to take this chance.

1395
02:09:32,583 --> 02:09:34,208
The Defence Minister was on his morning walk..

1396
02:09:34,708 --> 02:09:36,583
.. at 07:58AM with two body guards..

1397
02:09:37,083 --> 02:09:38,541
..when two unidentified gunmen opened fire.

1398
02:09:39,041 --> 02:09:40,083
He was hit by 3 bullets in his chest, and..

1399
02:09:40,583 --> 02:09:44,083
.. was declared dead on reaching hospital.

1400
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,500
Government spokesmen believe that this is..

1401
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,166
.. an attempt to destablize the govt.

1402
02:10:02,666 --> 02:10:05,500
The country has lost a great leader because..

1403
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,041
.. of the cowardly act of some terrorists.

1404
02:10:08,541 --> 02:10:10,541
He was a true soldier, a true patriot..

1405
02:10:11,041 --> 02:10:13,833
.. who sacrificed his life for the country.

1406
02:10:14,333 --> 02:10:19,541
His contribution to the country cannot be described in words.

1407
02:10:20,041 --> 02:10:22,541
Sukhi!

1408
02:10:23,041 --> 02:10:24,041
Meanwhile our sources have discovered..

1409
02:10:24,541 --> 02:10:26,083
.. a telephonic conversation..

1410
02:10:26,583 --> 02:10:27,708
.. between the Late Defence Minister Shastri..

1411
02:10:28,208 --> 02:10:30,208
.. This conversation took place just a few..

1412
02:10:30,708 --> 02:10:34,166
.. days before the Defence Minister's murder.

1413
02:10:34,666 --> 02:10:36,500
Sir, nothing to worry, the Russians want..

1414
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:37,958
.. us to reduce our commission.

1415
02:10:38,458 --> 02:10:42,708
Didn't you tell them it's not a defence deal, first it is our deal.

1416
02:10:43,208 --> 02:10:46,375
That's why I was also adamant, this is the deal, if you want..

1417
02:10:46,875 --> 02:10:50,375
Let's go.

1418
02:10:55,375 --> 02:10:58,875
Come on.

1419
02:10:59,791 --> 02:11:06,500
V.K. Shastri was killed by two unidentified persons.

1420
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Paaji, where's DJ?

1421
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:12,000
They were just here.

1422
02:11:15,833 --> 02:11:19,333
He hasn't come home all night.

1423
02:11:21,125 --> 02:11:24,291
Is everything alright? - Yes.

1424
02:11:24,791 --> 02:11:28,291
He said he'd be spending the night at DJ's. - Thank you.

1425
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:46,250
Have you seen DJ?

1426
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:48,625
Is everything alright?

1427
02:11:49,125 --> 02:11:55,375
I can't find them or Sonia.. I don't know where they are.

1428
02:11:55,875 --> 02:12:02,333
Come with me.. Sit, sit.

1429
02:12:02,833 --> 02:12:06,958
Don't worry.. nothing will happen to these boys.. - But DJ..

1430
02:12:07,458 --> 02:12:09,541
Daljeet has always been a brat..

1431
02:12:10,041 --> 02:12:12,916
.. he used to disappear on his bike for days..

1432
02:12:13,416 --> 02:12:15,541
He used disappear for the whole night.

1433
02:12:16,041 --> 02:12:18,208
He is my only son, if it had been two to four..

1434
02:12:18,708 --> 02:12:21,208
.. I would have slept easily.

1435
02:12:21,708 --> 02:12:23,250
I'm scared..

1436
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:26,291
Don't be afraid..

1437
02:12:26,791 --> 02:12:30,125
God will take care of everything..

1438
02:12:30,625 --> 02:12:34,125
God watches over the people we love.

1439
02:12:47,416 --> 02:12:50,375
Defence Minister.. the martyr..

1440
02:12:50,875 --> 02:12:58,875
.. one of India's favourite sons.. Bastard!

1441
02:12:59,375 --> 02:13:02,291
Read it. they're honoring him with the Bharat Ratna.

1442
02:13:02,791 --> 02:13:07,208
All our efforts, wasted.

1443
02:13:07,708 --> 02:13:09,291
People need to know the truth.

1444
02:13:09,791 --> 02:13:11,708
Sure..

1445
02:13:12,208 --> 02:13:14,750
We and have to surrender ourselves for it.

1446
02:13:15,250 --> 02:13:16,583
What?

1447
02:13:17,083 --> 02:13:21,500
Terrific! You want us to walk right..

1448
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:25,958
..in and give ourselves up!

1449
02:13:26,458 --> 02:13:27,500
And whom should we surrender to?

1450
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,166
The police are mere puppets.

1451
02:13:30,666 --> 02:13:32,541
So what should we do? Should we just sit back?

1452
02:13:33,041 --> 02:13:36,333
Let them say anything. - No! Let's kill them all!

1453
02:13:36,833 --> 02:13:38,791
Right Pandey? Bang! Bang! Bang!

1454
02:13:39,291 --> 02:13:42,791
Someone make him shut up!

1455
02:13:49,958 --> 02:13:53,166
You always knew that your father was in it.

1456
02:13:53,666 --> 02:13:57,583
You knew everything.

1457
02:13:58,083 --> 02:14:01,041
No I didn't know, Sukhi.. - Sukhi is dead..

1458
02:14:01,541 --> 02:14:02,583
You're lying!

1459
02:14:03,083 --> 02:14:04,875
You always wanted to take revenge on your father.

1460
02:14:05,375 --> 02:14:08,750
Sukhi, shut up! - I won't shut up.

1461
02:14:09,250 --> 02:14:12,833
Who am I to say anything? This Karan is only yours.

1462
02:14:13,333 --> 02:14:18,250
Hey Sukhi. - DJ he's used you.. - Shut up Sukhi.

1463
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:20,875
.. he's used all of us, all of us.

1464
02:14:21,375 --> 02:14:25,916
Mark my words, he will be safe, his father will bail him out.

1465
02:14:26,416 --> 02:14:30,458
But we'll get caught. And I don't want to die DJ.. - Sukhi.

1466
02:14:30,958 --> 02:14:34,458
I don't want to die.

1467
02:14:38,625 --> 02:14:42,125
We did all this for Ajay.

1468
02:14:45,208 --> 02:14:48,708
What will happen now DJ?

1469
02:14:55,166 --> 02:14:59,000
You've decided? - Yes.

1470
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:04,000
I need to know the truth.. don't worry.

1471
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:07,958
I'm not worried. Just don't be late.

1472
02:15:08,458 --> 02:15:11,083
The night is still young and the show's name is 'Raat Baki Baat Baki'

1473
02:15:11,583 --> 02:15:13,083
.. and I am Rahul, let's rock the party.

1474
02:15:13,583 --> 02:15:15,958
There's great DJ remixes coming up.

1475
02:15:16,458 --> 02:15:19,958
Nowadays new songs don't work old songs are..

1476
02:15:23,541 --> 02:15:25,291
Nothing will happen to you Karan.

1477
02:15:25,791 --> 02:15:27,666
That's a promise, nothing will happen to you.

1478
02:15:28,166 --> 02:15:31,541
Just give me the names of the others.

1479
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:33,541
I have good contacts.

1480
02:15:34,041 --> 02:15:35,708
I'll get you the best lawyers, pull all the strings possible.

1481
02:15:36,208 --> 02:15:38,291
But I will get you out from it.

1482
02:15:38,791 --> 02:15:42,666
You just have to say that you were forced into it..

1483
02:15:43,166 --> 02:15:43,833
.. do you understand ?

1484
02:15:44,333 --> 02:15:48,041
And then you are out of this country.

1485
02:15:48,541 --> 02:15:51,791
Say something. Do you get me?

1486
02:15:52,291 --> 02:15:54,958
Say something Damn it, Your father's reputation..

1487
02:15:55,458 --> 02:15:57,125
..his life's work is at stake.

1488
02:15:57,625 --> 02:16:02,541
Why did you do it? Why did you do it?

1489
02:16:03,041 --> 02:16:03,916
Why did you do it, Dad?

1490
02:16:04,416 --> 02:16:07,500
I.. What did I do?

1491
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,291
These people don't fear death.

1492
02:16:10,791 --> 02:16:13,000
Ajay used to say..

1493
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:18,458
..let death come.. anything for the country.

1494
02:16:18,958 --> 02:16:23,958
Ajay..

1495
02:16:24,458 --> 02:16:29,500
You'll handle it, out of the country.

1496
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:35,500
Ajay was burnt alive.. not for the country.

1497
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,083
You killed him!

1498
02:16:38,583 --> 02:16:40,708
You made him a joke..

1499
02:16:41,208 --> 02:16:43,750
I know you're very disturbed.

1500
02:16:44,250 --> 02:16:46,291
What has happened has happened.

1501
02:16:46,791 --> 02:16:49,791
Relax! Let me handle things.

1502
02:16:50,291 --> 02:16:53,541
I'll find a way out.

1503
02:16:54,041 --> 02:16:55,375
Really Dad? Is there a way out?

1504
02:16:55,875 --> 02:16:59,375
Of course. There are many ways.

1505
02:17:02,166 --> 02:17:05,666
Yes we'll go away from this country tonight.

1506
02:18:07,041 --> 02:18:11,125
You don't have to do this..

1507
02:18:11,625 --> 02:18:14,458
I want to.

1508
02:18:14,958 --> 02:18:19,833
Sukhi, this might end badly.

1509
02:18:20,333 --> 02:18:26,125
Without you guys it will end for me anyway..

1510
02:18:26,625 --> 02:18:30,125
Idiot. Come.

1511
02:18:39,041 --> 02:18:42,541
Ajay passed away. But his death won't go in vain, ma.

1512
02:18:50,500 --> 02:18:56,416
What is it about these boys that make them have no fear?

1513
02:18:56,916 --> 02:18:59,666
I think some times a person can be pushed so..

1514
02:19:00,166 --> 02:19:05,833
.. far that they reach a place beyond fear.

1515
02:19:06,333 --> 02:19:09,875
A place where we find a strange peace where you..

1516
02:19:10,375 --> 02:19:15,916
.. free yourselves to do the right thing.

1517
02:19:16,416 --> 02:19:21,583
And sometimes that's the hardest thing to do.

1518
02:19:22,083 --> 02:19:23,500
Welcome back to Raat Baaki Baat Baaki.

1519
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,833
This is Rahul, and you've tuned in to your favourite radio show..

1520
02:19:27,333 --> 02:19:30,833
.. let's listen to R.D. Burman's romantic music.

1521
02:20:50,291 --> 02:20:53,666
Hey Karan! What a surprise! What're you doing here?

1522
02:20:54,166 --> 02:20:56,416
We need a favour. - Sure!

1523
02:20:56,916 --> 02:20:57,958
I need you to put us on air.

1524
02:20:58,458 --> 02:21:02,875
I didn't understand. Put you on air?

1525
02:21:03,375 --> 02:21:04,916
Yeah, now! Live.

1526
02:21:05,416 --> 02:21:08,041
I want to go on air. Live. Is it some kind of a joke?

1527
02:21:08,541 --> 02:21:11,416
That's impossible man.. I'll lose my job.

1528
02:21:11,916 --> 02:21:14,333
It's payback time.

1529
02:21:14,833 --> 02:21:19,958
Hey! It's your station. Unreal man!

1530
02:21:20,458 --> 02:21:22,458
Gun.. He's got a gun!

1531
02:21:22,958 --> 02:21:25,750
Karan you go in. I'll handle it.

1532
02:21:26,250 --> 02:21:34,541
Keep the show on. Don't mess with us.

1533
02:21:35,041 --> 02:21:40,333
Come on.. leave, don't worry, nothing will happen.

1534
02:21:40,833 --> 02:21:44,083
Paaji is anyone inside?

1535
02:21:44,583 --> 02:21:48,833
Uncle-ji run. Don't stop.

1536
02:21:49,333 --> 02:21:54,750
Gun.. Security he's got a gun!

1537
02:21:55,250 --> 02:21:56,833
Don't be a wise guy.

1538
02:21:57,333 --> 02:21:59,833
Everybody leave! Out! Move!

1539
02:22:00,333 --> 02:22:03,416
Everybody leave! Out! Move!

1540
02:22:03,916 --> 02:22:07,333
Don't panic we won't harm anyone.

1541
02:22:07,833 --> 02:22:10,583
Move! Move! Move! Nothing will happen.

1542
02:22:11,083 --> 02:22:16,208
Move, Nothing will happen to you.

1543
02:22:16,708 --> 02:22:17,375
Nothing will happen to you, don't worry, move..

1544
02:22:17,875 --> 02:22:21,375
Hurry up, quick! Till downstairs.

1545
02:22:38,250 --> 02:22:40,333
The time is 6:05 a.m. My name is Rahul..

1546
02:22:40,833 --> 02:22:44,250
.. And you're listening to "The night is still young".

1547
02:22:44,750 --> 02:22:47,541
Today I've got a surprise guest for you.

1548
02:22:48,041 --> 02:22:50,208
An old friend of mine Karan Singhania who just..

1549
02:22:50,708 --> 02:22:54,208
.. dropped in to say something to all of you..

1550
02:23:00,416 --> 02:23:04,125
My name is Karan Singhania.. My friends and I..

1551
02:23:04,625 --> 02:23:07,791
.. we killed the Defence Minister Shastri..

1552
02:23:08,291 --> 02:23:12,291
I repeat we killed the Defence Minister..

1553
02:23:12,791 --> 02:23:15,958
Ravi take me to the radio station quickly. Hurry up!

1554
02:23:16,458 --> 02:23:22,083
We are not terrorists. We aren't backed by any foreign organisation.

1555
02:23:22,583 --> 02:23:25,541
We don't even belong to any political group..

1556
02:23:26,041 --> 02:23:28,625
We're just five students from Delhi University.

1557
02:23:29,125 --> 02:23:32,125
We killed the Defense Minister because he murdered..

1558
02:23:32,625 --> 02:23:37,166
.. our friend Flight Lieutenant Ajay Rathod..

1559
02:23:37,666 --> 02:23:40,791
.. and many other Air Force pilots..

1560
02:23:41,291 --> 02:23:43,708
We killed him because after he murdered Ajay,

1561
02:23:44,208 --> 02:23:46,708
.. he murdered his name..

1562
02:23:47,208 --> 02:23:50,208
Ajay's mother who not only sacrificed him..

1563
02:23:50,708 --> 02:23:53,291
.. but also her husband..

1564
02:23:53,791 --> 02:24:00,500
.. right now, is fighting for her life..

1565
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:06,458
A Defence Minister is supposed to safegaurd a nation. Not sell it.

1566
02:24:06,958 --> 02:24:09,875
Who will stop them? Law.

1567
02:24:10,375 --> 02:24:11,375
Men like the Defence Minister aren't just..

1568
02:24:11,875 --> 02:24:13,875
.. above the law.. they control it.

1569
02:24:14,375 --> 02:24:16,791
We killed the Defence Minister because..

1570
02:24:17,291 --> 02:24:19,500
.. he was roaming scot-free..

1571
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,833
.. even after committing such a big crime.

1572
02:24:23,333 --> 02:24:28,541
What we have done is wrong, may be it's a crime.

1573
02:24:29,041 --> 02:24:34,916
But we could not see all this. We have come here to surrender.

1574
02:24:35,416 --> 02:24:37,000
We have come here to tell everyone..

1575
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:40,333
.. that we must do something.

1576
02:24:40,833 --> 02:24:46,000
We all have to do something.

1577
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,500
We've just received news that the Defence..

1578
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,958
.. Minister's assassins are hiding in the All India Radio building.

1579
02:24:50,458 --> 02:24:52,666
Karan Singhania and his friends are still with us.

1580
02:24:53,166 --> 02:25:00,791
Listeners can call in on 3291777.

1581
02:25:01,291 --> 02:25:04,791
Until then..

1582
02:25:11,458 --> 02:25:14,958
It's done.

1583
02:25:22,583 --> 02:25:25,708
"Hey, dude!"

1584
02:25:26,208 --> 02:25:34,041
"I just realized."

1585
02:25:34,541 --> 02:25:41,958
"There's a fire burning within me."

1586
02:25:42,458 --> 02:25:45,750
"It's a new dawn."

1587
02:25:46,250 --> 02:25:49,708
"I can feel its light."

1588
02:25:50,208 --> 02:25:56,333
"Burn so bright, I could, scorch the sun."

1589
02:25:56,833 --> 02:26:04,333
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1590
02:26:04,833 --> 02:26:13,125
"Cause I'm face to face with the light."

1591
02:26:13,625 --> 02:26:25,041
"The dream I once lost, I've found."

1592
02:26:25,541 --> 02:26:29,083
"It's blooming."

1593
02:26:29,583 --> 02:26:37,125
"It's melting."

1594
02:26:37,625 --> 02:26:44,833
"Notes arranging."

1595
02:26:45,333 --> 02:26:54,333
"Into a whole new melody."

1596
02:26:54,833 --> 02:26:58,250
Will they give us good food in jail?

1597
02:26:58,750 --> 02:27:02,250
Food? Next he'll want beer.

1598
02:27:09,375 --> 02:27:11,041
You guys have become famous.

1599
02:27:11,541 --> 02:27:14,041
Calls are pouring in from all over the country.

1600
02:27:14,541 --> 02:27:16,750
Come on! They want to talk to you..

1601
02:27:17,250 --> 02:27:21,666
Your news has spread everywhere.

1602
02:27:22,166 --> 02:27:23,916
Police! - Police!

1603
02:27:24,416 --> 02:27:25,916
This is unreal man. How did this happen?

1604
02:27:26,416 --> 02:27:28,916
Where did they come from? This will ruin my career..

1605
02:27:29,416 --> 02:27:31,750
Quiet! You move, Karan, get him out.

1606
02:27:32,250 --> 02:27:34,083
Karan you get on air.. We don't have much time..

1607
02:27:34,583 --> 02:27:36,041
They will catch us within Fifteen minutes..

1608
02:27:36,541 --> 02:27:37,791
.. you go and say whatever you want.

1609
02:27:38,291 --> 02:27:41,791
Take care.

1610
02:27:44,166 --> 02:27:45,500
The Delhi police have reached the spot and..

1611
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,916
.. are rescuing civilians trapped in the building.

1612
02:27:48,416 --> 02:27:50,083
The responsibility of the Minister's murder..

1613
02:27:50,583 --> 02:27:51,666
.. has just reached Calcutta.

1614
02:27:52,166 --> 02:27:54,750
I am in Bangalore and as you can see all the students..

1615
02:27:55,250 --> 02:27:57,166
.. reporting from Mumbai's Churchgate area..

1616
02:27:57,666 --> 02:27:59,250
.. reporting from Cotton College, Guwahati.

1617
02:27:59,750 --> 02:28:01,333
.. reporting from S. P. College, Srinagar..

1618
02:28:01,833 --> 02:28:02,958
.. reporting from Lucknow University..

1619
02:28:03,458 --> 02:28:05,875
.. and the reactions are coming very fast.

1620
02:28:06,375 --> 02:28:09,125
Hi, my name is Prakash. And I want to congratulate you.

1621
02:28:09,625 --> 02:28:10,666
You did the right thing by killing him.

1622
02:28:11,166 --> 02:28:14,666
All our ministers should be lined up and shot.

1623
02:28:15,166 --> 02:28:18,500
Mr. Prakash, who all will you shoot?

1624
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:22,250
These corrupt ministers are a reflection of our society.

1625
02:28:22,750 --> 02:28:24,125
We've chosen them.

1626
02:28:24,625 --> 02:28:26,875
If they are corrupt then so are we.

1627
02:28:27,375 --> 02:28:29,708
We need to change ourselves to bring about a change.

1628
02:28:30,208 --> 02:28:31,500
Hello this is Principal Sharma, Government..

1629
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,541
.. Higher Secondary School from Indore..

1630
02:28:35,041 --> 02:28:36,000
You have set a bad example by taking..

1631
02:28:36,500 --> 02:28:39,791
.. the law into your own hands.

1632
02:28:40,291 --> 02:28:44,208
You're right sir. We're sorry.

1633
02:28:44,708 --> 02:28:47,166
But give me the name of one politician who..

1634
02:28:47,666 --> 02:28:51,000
.. has gone to jail for his crimes.

1635
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:53,375
Who else is on your hit-list?

1636
02:28:53,875 --> 02:28:56,083
We have no hit-list.

1637
02:28:56,583 --> 02:28:58,541
How do you feel after killing the Defence Minister?

1638
02:28:59,041 --> 02:29:02,583
We had no enmity. It's not that we killed him and have cooled down.

1639
02:29:03,083 --> 02:29:06,583
We still have the rage within.

1640
02:29:22,916 --> 02:29:26,958
If you get caught you'll be hanged. Aren't you afraid?

1641
02:29:27,458 --> 02:29:31,125
No.

1642
02:29:31,625 --> 02:29:35,750
As you can see the Black Cats have reached the place.

1643
02:29:36,250 --> 02:29:41,750
And the boys who have killed the minister are still inside.

1644
02:29:42,250 --> 02:29:44,583
Karan, I don't know whether you did right or wrong..

1645
02:29:45,083 --> 02:29:49,208
..while we applaud your courage, do you think you will get out alive?

1646
02:29:49,708 --> 02:29:53,041
Death doesn't scare us.

1647
02:29:53,541 --> 02:29:57,041
No one should remain alive. I don't want any survivor. - Yes sir.

1648
02:30:18,625 --> 02:30:20,875
Sukhi

1649
02:30:21,375 --> 02:30:23,125
Bullets are being shot in All India Radio.

1650
02:30:23,625 --> 02:30:27,125
Ravi, please make him go quickly.

1651
02:30:33,375 --> 02:30:36,375
Shit! They're shooting at us DJ! They're shooting at us!

1652
02:30:36,875 --> 02:30:42,750
Shut up for a second!

1653
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:48,000
They're mistaking us for terrorists. They think we're armed.

1654
02:30:48,500 --> 02:30:52,000
Don't worry, I will handle it, Don't worry.

1655
02:31:05,083 --> 02:31:11,958
No.. Kill me.. Kill me..

1656
02:31:12,458 --> 02:31:22,208
Sukhi.. No Sukhi! What did you do! What did you do?

1657
02:31:22,708 --> 02:31:31,666
Shit DJ! Just when I was getting good with the girls.. - No, Sukhi..

1658
02:31:32,166 --> 02:31:35,666
No, Sukhi..

1659
02:31:50,250 --> 02:31:51,750
My name is Indra. What's the difference..

1660
02:31:52,250 --> 02:31:53,458
.. between you and terrorists?

1661
02:31:53,958 --> 02:31:57,458
There's a big difference.. terrorists kill innocents, we didn't..

1662
02:32:07,458 --> 02:32:10,958
Aslam..

1663
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:16,291
..close the door. Quick!

1664
02:32:16,791 --> 02:32:20,291
We are not terrorists. Why don't they..

1665
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:13,625
It's not a lust for blood.. it's a matter of justice!

1666
02:33:14,125 --> 02:33:15,000
Why are bullets being used when it's clear..

1667
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:18,291
.. that these are college students?

1668
02:33:18,791 --> 02:33:22,291
This is Shomu Bose from All India Radio for NDTV.

1669
02:35:04,375 --> 02:35:07,958
No matter what you do, this country..

1670
02:35:08,458 --> 02:35:16,333
.. will never change. It has no future.

1671
02:35:16,833 --> 02:35:20,333
No country is perfect. You've got to make it perfect.

1672
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Join the police, military, IAS..

1673
02:35:33,500 --> 02:35:38,208
Become a part of the political system..

1674
02:35:38,708 --> 02:35:45,291
This country will change.. We will change it!

1675
02:35:45,791 --> 02:35:47,208
If you believed the Defence Minister..

1676
02:35:47,708 --> 02:35:49,458
.. deserved to be punished then..

1677
02:35:49,958 --> 02:35:55,416
.. what about the allegations against your father?

1678
02:35:55,916 --> 02:35:59,291
Don't worry.. We'll find a way to fix this.

1679
02:35:59,791 --> 02:36:00,666
Is there any way out, Dad?

1680
02:36:01,166 --> 02:36:04,666
Of course, I am there, I will handle everything.

1681
02:36:20,875 --> 02:36:24,375
I'm sorry Dad..

1682
02:36:51,958 --> 02:36:54,833
My name is Daljeet Singh.

1683
02:36:55,333 --> 02:36:58,166
There are only two ways to live your life.

1684
02:36:58,666 --> 02:37:05,583
Tolerate things the way they are.

1685
02:37:06,083 --> 02:37:12,500
Or take responsibility to change them.

1686
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:16,500
Karan Singhania killed his father before coming here.

1687
02:37:25,250 --> 02:37:30,000
Shit DJ!

1688
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:32,708
You're bleeding badly!

1689
02:37:33,208 --> 02:37:37,458
Relax! It got tired of flowing in my veins.

1690
02:37:37,958 --> 02:37:41,041
It just wanted to be free.

1691
02:37:41,541 --> 02:37:44,666
Aslam.. Laxman.. Sukhi?

1692
02:37:45,166 --> 02:37:48,666
All gone.

1693
02:37:58,791 --> 02:38:05,416
.. Karan, I think I'm in love..

1694
02:38:05,916 --> 02:38:08,875
.. I never told you dude..

1695
02:38:09,375 --> 02:38:16,000
.. can't stop thinking about her..

1696
02:38:16,500 --> 02:38:20,875
I know.. she's something else.

1697
02:38:21,375 --> 02:38:24,875
You two'll make a great couple.

1698
02:38:29,291 --> 02:38:32,708
There's just one problem. I don't know if..

1699
02:38:33,208 --> 02:38:36,708
.. the kids will be black or white.

1700
02:38:41,125 --> 02:38:44,625
Damn Exhibitionist!

1701
02:38:59,916 --> 02:39:03,416
Let me go! They're just boys, damn it!

1702
02:39:15,625 --> 02:39:19,041
I always believed that there were two kinds of men in this world.

1703
02:39:19,541 --> 02:39:22,750
.. who go to their death screaming and men..

1704
02:39:23,250 --> 02:39:27,291
Men who go to their death in silence.

1705
02:39:27,791 --> 02:39:31,291
And then I met the third kind.

1706
02:40:18,041 --> 02:40:19,666
Sending the commandoes is the death of democracy.

1707
02:40:20,166 --> 02:40:22,500
Today is a sad day in the history of Indian politics.

1708
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,291
We'll turn this small lamp in to a huge fireball.

1709
02:40:25,791 --> 02:40:28,541
There will be an awakening and will take a huge toll on corruption.

1710
02:40:29,041 --> 02:40:30,708
The truth has to come out in some way and if it has..

1711
02:40:31,208 --> 02:40:32,708
.. to come out like this then we are all for it.

1712
02:40:33,208 --> 02:40:37,541
We need such awakening if we want every individual to step out.

1713
02:40:38,041 --> 02:40:39,583
Are we going to sit and do nothing?

1714
02:40:40,083 --> 02:40:40,958
So we have got to take some steps.

1715
02:40:41,458 --> 02:40:44,000
They have done it. They have taken the right decision.

1716
02:40:44,500 --> 02:40:46,833
That day will come when everything will be beautiful..

1717
02:40:47,333 --> 02:40:48,791
.. and there will be no corruption.

1718
02:40:49,291 --> 02:40:51,333
The fire that you have ignited in our minds and hearts..

1719
02:40:51,833 --> 02:40:53,041
.. it's not going to fizz out very soon.

1720
02:40:53,541 --> 02:40:55,541
We will make sure that your dream goes till the end. - We will do it.

1721
02:40:56,041 --> 02:40:59,541
Dear Lord, please accept the sacrifice of the children.

1722
02:41:10,458 --> 02:41:15,416
I come here with Sonia a lot just like old times.

1723
02:41:15,916 --> 02:41:19,625
And sometimes I hear the voices carried by the evening breeze.

1724
02:41:20,125 --> 02:41:23,625
Not words just sounds, sounds of laughter.

1725
02:41:48,958 --> 02:41:52,750
Come Bhagat Singh..

1726
02:41:53,250 --> 02:41:55,125
Father, what are you doing?

1727
02:41:55,625 --> 02:41:59,125
I'm sowing mango seeds. If I plant one, it will reap thousands.

1728
02:42:26,833 --> 02:42:29,916
"Hey, dude!"

1729
02:42:30,416 --> 02:42:38,250
"I just realized."

1730
02:42:38,750 --> 02:42:46,125
"There's a fire burning within me."

1731
02:42:46,625 --> 02:42:50,125
"It's a new dawn."

1732
02:42:50,625 --> 02:42:53,875
"I can feel its light."

1733
02:42:54,375 --> 02:43:00,500
"Burn so bright, I could, scorch the sun."

1734
