1
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:27,028
Smoke rises over the
mountains to the north.

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,705
It is a sight that man makes
the blood run cold in the Adam.

3
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:39,214
more than 400 years beginning
people lived in this area in peace.

4
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,174
But that's over now The evil spirit
has returned to the Shoukata </?p>

5
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:49,137
And he will not rest until
he has subjected all mankind.

6
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:04,532
There is only one man, the
may oppose the darkness.

7
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,366
a man whom even the ancient
prophecies of the ancestors boast.

8
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:14,329
the chosen warriors.

9
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,645
Hail, Ranger.

10
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,320
do not speak Can you? Did you
about someone cut out the tongue?

11
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:12,993
What just happened here
Yes but you can not speak?

12
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,447
For a modest mite, I'll
tell you everything I know.

13
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,953
Perhaps even more, my friend.

14
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:23,253
I'm not your friend And as a
reward I give you your life!.

15
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,748
Agreed?

16
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,049
You've probably really need it?

17
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,587
I only tried a little
bit strike out for me.

18
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,808
is in times like these,
but totally normal, right?

19
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,432
What is this place? A City

20
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,224
's was certainly times.
Her name was Amandu.

21
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:48,904
once lived here thousands, but now
they are all dead Who did this?

22
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,738
Warriors of Shoukata.

23
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,325
And you'll end up the same
way if you not soon disappear.

24
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,660
nowhere one can see. The
dive on already, no question.

25
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,787
Come, we must go.

26
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,458
Can you tell me what you're
doing I will fight with them!.

27
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,385
And why the only reason why I am here

28
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,832
This Ranger is really good!

29
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,259
Maybe he's there...

30
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,671
I ask forgiveness.

31
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,004
very determined you are the chosen one

32
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,887
standing again. What did you call me?

33
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,437
What does that mean
Please, let's get out!.

34
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:48,773
Then I'll tell you
everything I know. Comes.

35
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,955
I would not have guessed in life,
that I get to meet the chosen warriors.

36
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,042
something is really not!

37
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,270
Most of these stories are
prophecies or just fairy tales!

38
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,463
Because you never know. what is
true of them believe what you can...

39
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:20,343
Who would have thought
that I, Brutus Generavxra,

40
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:23,012
stride on the side
of the chosen warrior.

41
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,137
And then I got in
trouble because I played.

42
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:29,936
drank too much wine,
you know how that is.

43
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,560
What man does not know
that And then the women...!

44
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:36,528
How should a man keep
away from the women?

45
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,739
I am sure that will not do is
predetermined, do not you think?

46
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:44,204
For me at least I can
not stay away from them.

47
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:47,165
Unless you're more
on boys or something.

48
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,373
We are talking only...
And thoughts are free

49
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,548
It goes...

50
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,545
It goes that way.

51
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,176
After almost a year I
think in the Golden City

52
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,560
it was time to move on to see
what the world has to offer you.

53
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,105
To tell the truth, they
put me out the door.

54
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:19,698
And so I end up just landed there

55
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,742
where we met two of us And I realized

56
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,404
I now must fight!

57
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,619
What is not my strong Not really.

58
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:40,381
And, thus, the chosen
warriors on the way

59
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:44,264
Shoukaia to the Lord
of Darkness, to defeat..

60
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,353
Look, a lake Since we'll
have to mix around drum..

61
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,352
This done with the left. No,
we will spend the night here.

62
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:56,900
A good place for us
what we hunt for dinner.

63
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:03,033
If you can keep your mouth shut while
Is that clear, I do my best, my lord.

64
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,045
run of it, my friend Otherwise
you'll unsren silent hunger..

65
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,065
You have attained the
magic of swift sword.

66
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,867
least the gossips not
come back emptyhanded.

67
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,500
What do you mean with empty hands?

68
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,042
man, where did you get that?

69
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,133
can surely be no coincidence
you for such a wonderful weapon

70
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:05,220
in the woods find That was a fish..

71
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,719
fish Ask not just continue?.

72
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,221
Well, I wonder no further.

73
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,512
That would be a true miracle.

74
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,313
Did you hear that noise I know

75
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,611
What noise? The Swords

76
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,366
What swords The enchanted
swords of Demaclus

77
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,369
They were never defeated
we must get out of here.!

78
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,952
No, I'm ready. We stay here

79
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,394
Let go of the thing
Impossible, My Lord!

80
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,419
Was that all? More
you have not 'on that?

81
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,754
If you want to defeat me, you give
more effort! Much more trouble!

82
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,010
You did what any
successful in reaching] e!

83
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:13,014
You besiegtest the enchanted swords
of Demaclus! The other tried already?

84
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,554
Oh Yes. How many?

85
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,976
Many, My Lord, on them every failed
to challenge the Shoukata wanted.

86
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,494
What is it?

87
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:44,296
I think this is a of magic
stones of the ancient gods.

88
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:50,385
It means they enable the wearer
special power. Exactly what power?

89
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,637
Each stone is good for
something else, those

90
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:55,716
things are rare. Since
I'm really stumped.

91
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,334
I feel stronger, This is the
stone of strength, My Lord.

92
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,249
We need to make our
way we have to do much.

93
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,213
No question. Come on, my friend.

94
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,549
After his glorious victory
over the vervvunschenen swords,

95
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,933
the chosen warriors is now
ready for new challenges.

96
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,269
What is our next task
Good question, my lord.

97
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,498
But I do not know.
because before you, did

98
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:49,523
not defeated the
enchanted swords. Really?

99
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:52,113
Otherwise I would certainly
find it... You sure?

100
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,491
Sure, what do you think?

101
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,882
Are you hurt, my lord: no. All good.

102
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,598
That was a real spectacle
how you defeated the Giants.

103
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,059
Come on, let's go.

104
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,693
The bird is delicious.

105
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,401
Not bad

106
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,404
Tell me about the way
ahead of us. By the way?

107
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,873
Yes, our way of...

108
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:30,788
In ancient prophecy says

109
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,339
the chosen warriors
must move towards north,

110
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,876
in the home Shoukatas and defeat him.

111
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,389
And you know what else Hard to say?.

112
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:48,267
Want to be in the forbidden land,
need to log in seven tests set

113
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,229
Of the time are difficult to
date, the time no warrior survived.

114
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,236
Is that all Some say
this and others say so?.

115
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,613
But these are the main points.

116
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:08,033
We need a little rest, I
'll take the first watch.

117
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,996
power that you get back in your holes!

118
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,920
Who are you? Do not worry,
I am the ruler of the forest.

119
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,260
I came because I want to
help you Why did you help me?

120
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,517
Because we have common interests.

121
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,846
Thou shalt conquer the
evil spirit of darkness

122
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,310
and I hope that you succeed.

123
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,318
Please, take a seat

124
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,072
And what were the just for creatures?

125
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,741
The guards of the six kingdom
ready to destroy anyone

126
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,073
opposes the black rulers.

127
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,156
They will report Shoukata
about your successes.

128
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,559
He will send others
to kill you stronger

129
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,577
and more powerful than you may know.

130
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,836
Protects your me also facing. My Lady
I have protected you not know that.

131
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,714
back Since there is no doubt at all..

132
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,425
But I guard your sleep till morning

133
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,472
and'll help you on
your journey if I can.

134
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,351
Now you have to sleep good
advice I will give you even more..

135
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,054
The nearest village
enters only from the east,

136
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,155
My Lady?

137
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,532
My Lady!

138
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,115
what War The most amazing
creature I ever saw?.

139
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:17,166
You are the ruler of the
forest have met Yes, exactly?.

140
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,753
No mortal she got more previously seen.

141
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,966
As you can imagine what you
excited If you're mortal.

142
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,676
But the chosen warriors
must remain vigilant.

143
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,853
because the path on which
he walks, is paved with lies

144
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:36,063
and lined with treason

145
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,651
How far is it? even to the next
village I'm not quite sure, my lord.

146
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,946
But I do. it is here very close.

147
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,326
Then we go from the
south to enter? Exactly

148
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:54,207
Then we have beat an arc we
have to come from the east.

149
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:55,700
But this is the shortest way!

150
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,045
The ruler of the forest said from
the east we have to clean.. Good

151
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,753
We sneak carefully and see.
what she was trying to warn us.

152
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,677
Agreed, but be on the lookout

153
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,413
What a monster

154
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,424
Aha! And you claim the
chosen warriors to be?.

155
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:48,845
No, I never said moment you
talk with the animals there?

156
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,435
For whatever reason, I understand
you I'll let you read my mind

157
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,770
How do you know who I
am Questions, questions!

158
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:03,024
your man is constantly questions.

159
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,938
man. across the country
you will soon sung in songs!

160
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,908
I understand. Should the chosen
warriors fight a duel with me?

161
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:15,489
I wish not then you're
smarter than I thought..

162
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:20,752
But you come one step closer, we
need to fight, there gives no quarter.

163
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,171
Is that your last word I
have nothing more to say?.

164
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,257
I have no choice. Did you exceeded
the limit. I must attack you.

165
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:33,173
Then we go visit
Because you're a coward.?

166
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,226
No. Because I kill such
a majestic creature not.

167
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,938
Come on, Brutus

168
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:46,812
Good luck... Thank you, sir.

169
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,365
You spoke with the
dragon, is that true?

170
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:00,182
Yes. And what did he so the story?

171
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:03,626
Come on, what did he tell you?

172
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:07,006
that it was wise to follow the
advice the ruler of the forest.

173
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,423
Are you sure that the dragon
not following us? Trust me.

174
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,968
He does mom. Come on.

175
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,295
Sorry but you are dead.

176
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,428
Now you have three ways you
can begin your search by from,

177
00:20:58,463 --> 00:21:01,559
your weapon and all
that you are carrying.

178
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:06,725
Or you go on, because where you
were but then you lose your sword.

179
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,487
And the third possibility
You stay here with me?.

180
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,865
for ever

181
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,367
Make your choice. Or
I meet them for you

182
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,245
What's In the second option?

183
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,043
lady choice is made, so be it.

184
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,448
You're alive yet!

185
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,044
Sure You're healed,
it's like a miracle...

186
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,424
This is the second chance
Yes but you yourself know..

187
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:19,927
What I know myself You are
here, and thus a part of that web.

188
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:24,177
You speak in riddles
Never mind, Brutus..

189
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,978
So let's continue...

190
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,736
So far r. Please.

191
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,315
It's so cozy here.

192
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,818
Brutus? It's not serious.

193
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,786
But please. Well, come on,

194
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:48,327
A small piece just yet That's
not true... well. Thank you.

195
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,193
Who are you? Claudius. Pass yes to what

196
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:06,477
you words tumble out
of the tongue, you dog.

197
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,184
Otherwise I cut it out yourself!

198
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,852
Say. I Claudius.

199
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:19,691
This is Teradon We are
from the village Samarin

200
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,906
In the penultimate
night we were attacked

201
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:31,707
by the soldiers of evil Shoukata,

202
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,165
all killed.

203
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,592
men, women, children,

204
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,673
the cattle...

205
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:50,347
The few that have survived
are fled to the mountains.

206
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,564
But there they will not survive.

207
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,859
Shoukatas were warriors? Exactly.

208
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:09,157
A complete company his demon
soldiers. Then I'll help you

209
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,623
What then is ins?

210
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,964
Forgive me, Lord...

211
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,216
But you alone against the
soldiers how will you do that?

212
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:31,433
Do not you understand. you
fool? He is the chosen warrior.

213
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,701
You are the chosen one?
Can you hear bad He is

214
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:38,190
the warrior, to which
we have been waiting for!

215
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:47,036

216
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,663
Forgive me, please.

217
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,242
I beg you.. Get up,

218
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,796
Where is your village?

219
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:02,005
two days' journey to the south.

220
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,968
south We were going
west, right, Brutus?

221
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,223
Yes, My Lord, that is true.

222
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,852
And we can not deviate from the path!

223
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:15,390
Please, My Lord, help me.

224
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,355
Help my relatives.

225
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:25,779
Are women and children in danger
Yes, most will not survive.

226
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,536
Then I'll protect these
people But... My Lord.

227
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:32,115
The search will have to wait a little
This decision was not difficult..

228
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,996
Well, let's go

229
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,151

230
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,641

231
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:47,031
On your knees, you pig but we
wanted to help you, but just!

232
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:50,617

Otherwise I cut it out to you?

233
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,246
Fessle him.

234
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,634
Are you a servant of
the Lord of Darkness?

235
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:17,391
And what are you going to
Wanna kill me with bare hands?

236
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,360
Reptus Tannous, a magic potion.

237
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,409
Mixed from snakes, pigs and dogs blood

238
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,534
wild flowers and roots.

239
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:48,092
Deadly poison It will
flow through your veins.

240
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:53,010
The body is shaken by Krämpíeri.

241
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:59,728
sallow purple And
then approaching death.

242
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,609
But...

243
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:17,701
a sip of this drink and you'll be okay?

244
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:26,626
And if it's the last breath
I would you solder with joy.

245
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:32,427
The Demon Slayer is already go.

246
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,275
No, I'm not the chosen one

247
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,866
You're a pretty stupid
Demon Slayer, right?

248
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,419
? What you gonna do with me?

249
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:14,086
I'm going to kill for. No, the guy
is in there as feast for the beasts

250
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:19,258
to live in the forest. I can not
and I will not perish in this way.

251
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,179
Unfortunately, you have no
choice But I'm a Demon Slayer

252
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:26,516
And my life is ending
I have to die in combat!

253
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:31,404
will happen perhaps even
Brutus Come, let's go.

254
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,031
me to leave here, but it is not fair!

255
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,278
Art thou a coward?

256
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:42,748
Tell me, you're a coward
Get on it not, My Lord!.

257
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,417
But I will.

258
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,419
Promise this man you if you kill me

259
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:53,334
Lets him get away not you
promise, he leaves you in the hole.

260
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,216
And it has all been for nothing.

261
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:59,973
You are well on it from,
me to spoil all the fun.

262
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,808
Agreed so good, I should beat you

263
00:30:04,843 --> 00:30:07,147
I let the dwarf alive.

264
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,605
You must swear to me, you let
me go and krümmst me no hair.

265
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,945
I swear, clear?

266
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,532
Great, the word of a Demon Slayer

267
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,448
Is worse

268
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,726
Brutus! Throw the rope timesdown

269
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,020
Want to solder not the guy
No, not today, Brutus?.

270
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,402
Throw the rope down,

271
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,776
The giant had Achilles heel,

272
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:45,449
and the Demon Slayer pride was fatal.

273
00:31:45,484 --> 00:31:48,915
But Shoukata this kind
human weaknesses are foreign.

274
00:31:56,456 --> 00:32:00,051
My Lord I have news from the forest!.

275
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,924
Then tell 'what you have to say.

276
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,890
The Chosen Warrior is still alive.

277
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,663
And he defeated the
warriors from the villages

278
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:14,189
and enchanted swords of Damaclus

279
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:17,273
And now he's got <br /
defeated> the Demon Slayer.

280
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:20,362
And he comes the fortress ever closer!

281
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:23,901
Who is this man, who
dares to challenge me?

282
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,820
I do not know, My Lord.

283
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,703
You have no idea?

284
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,664
your sword,

285
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:42,882
Is it too hot? Of course, My Lord.

286
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,632
Very good.

287
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:59,294
Let the "Six" of the chain. let
them bring me these stupid people.

288
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:03,949
possible in very small,
appetizing pieces. Yes, My Lord.

289
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,534
How good that you could
overcome the pitfall Claudius.

290
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,199
I was just lucky
happiness.? It was masterful!

291
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:17,079
Once I defeated the rulers of
the darkness, I will reward you.

292
00:33:17,114 --> 00:33:19,831
was very friendly but I wonder

293
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:22,334
what prince of darkness
well planned next for us.

294
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:54,203
The black prince is consistently
powerful We must hurry.

295
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,258
It's getting dark, we be staying here.

296
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:15,766
Then I'll get us something to eat
And I'll take care of the fire.

297
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,661
My Lady, I had so much
hoped meet you again.

298
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:34,539
I'm you never left the side

299
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:38,419
course. I told you, I hope
that you end up 're successful.

300
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,958
reason alone You keep me
in mind No, not sure?.

301
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,549
But for this issue we have
no time Here, take this sword.

302
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:51,719
You'll need very soon.

303
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:59,936
This is a wonderful sword One of
the most precious in our world..

304
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,108
It was forged by the gods personally.

305
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:08,280
Thank you. What do I owe you
for this gift? Nothing at all

306
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:12,286
And yet it is too early to thank me.
To carry the sword of the gods and out,

307
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,245
does not mean your victory.

308
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,374
And what do I have You have
to find the magic of the Samurai

309
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,379
Only then are you ready for the
next task. And where do I find it?

310
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,667
You'll find him when the time
is right, the gods are with you.

311
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,511
Good luck to you my chosen one

312
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,352
My Lady...

313
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,471
My Lady.

314
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,687
My Lady? The mistress of the forest
you already visited again? Yes.

315
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,584
And why the woman always
comes when I hunt now?

316
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:49,360
What I know you gave
me the sword here?.

317
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,408
Six..,

Please? The Black Prince
has sent the six samurai.

319
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,668
Samurai find us so you

00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:07,257
And who are these six samurai? The
nastiest fighters that you can imagine.

321
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:09,296
yet never defeated.

322
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:15,386
The enchanted swords
were also undefeated.

323
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:20,224
Samurai nasty surprise Yes, may be..

324
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,814
the Lady Did you anything else?

325
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,858
you said I must find
the magic of the Samurai

326
00:36:28,893 --> 00:36:30,945
Then we immediately set off.

327
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,200
We have no time to lose
we hurry. All right.

328
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:38,823
Do not worry, my friend,

329
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,661
you Has the lady might tell where
we find the magic of the Samurai?

330
00:37:22,696 --> 00:37:25,709
She said when the time is
right we find him already.

331
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,248
Typical woman, you ask politely,
but 'll never get a straight answer.

332
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:34,299
Now I know why the lady appears never
when you're there. That could agree.

333
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,803
Maybe. If you's right, I'll do the
six samurai existed even before supper.

334
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,802
That's a plan.

335
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,755
Brutus, did you hear
that What is it, my lord?

336
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,216
Someone laughed.

337
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:33,401
There! You hear that?

338
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,656
I can not hear anything
Who's laughing because since.?

339
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:41,574
Who's there Show yourself,
or are you a coward?

340
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,975
A squirrel is not.

341
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:11,232
What do you want from me
We are just passing through?.

342
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:14,480

to pass her my kingdom?

343
00:39:14,515 --> 00:39:17,693
We did not know that the
forest is your property.

344
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:21,735
We simply want to wander through
Please go away and hits the road.

345
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,238
You must not happen,
it unless you pay a fee.

346
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,328
I want to hurt you hate,
magicians, but if I have,

347
00:39:31,363 --> 00:39:35,457
I will cut off your head.

348
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:39,628
It will not come as much Believe
me, Tree Man, he's serious..

349
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,933
So what do you propose?

350
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,555
What you got? I warned you.

351
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:09,825
How did you do the That
far exceeds your mind?.

352
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:15,209
If you want to happen but you
have to me solve a mystery.

353
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,678
And what happens if we go ahead?

354
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,067
Do you listen to my riddle?

355
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:42,362
What is probably harder A pound of
goose feathers or a pound of gold?

356
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,745
Well, both... Yes?

357
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,160
feathers And why?

358
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,127
you weigh gold in troy ounces...

359
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,756
have the troy weights only
twelve ounces per pound.

360
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,634
The springs there are
sixteen ounces per pound.

361
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:04,129
Thus they are probably harder.

362
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,303
You're right, you clever Meier

363
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,906
And I must say that
it is a pleasure for me

364
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:13,681
. Acquaintance <br /
make> a sowellbred man.

365
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,108
Wade, is that it?

366
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,646
That's the key! the gods!

367
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:26,196
Either it was you made of the
mistress of the forest as a gift

368
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:29,704
or you're a thief, of stole
it. He is not a thief.

369
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:36,420
Then almost seems to me
you're the chosen warriors...

370
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:41,208
in search of the magic of the
Samurai Exactly what I look for.

371
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:44,550
Why did you say not the
same from the beginning?

372
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,340
Then we had but can save
this whole shindig here!

373
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,348
Then you have the magic? Sure,

374
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,511
course I have to spell it

375
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,435
But better that you learn
him weasel speedy heart.

376
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,809
The Six Samurai are already here

377
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,904
You have attained the
magic of the samurai.

378
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:17,303
The Six Samurai were defeated
No man can do it, no one!

379
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:19,175
And yet it is true, my lord.

380
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,021
How is one man who
can defeat six samurai?

381
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:26,983
I do not know, My Lord
He's a good fighter.?

382
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:30,813
Only fools mouth make known
this kind nonsense. My Lord?

383
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,322
but has to do with the
fighting strength of nothing!

384
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:36,985
Someone helps him determine
he has received support!

385
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,245
Exactly. The man got help,

386
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,910
Spionier the man out, find
out from whom he gets help!

387
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,704
go early. Yes, My Lord.

388
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,963
Well done, My Lord!

389
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,400
Mistress of the forest
is absolutely right.

390
00:45:53,435 --> 00:45:55,803
You are indeed the chosen warriors.

391
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:59,486
And you should someday
on your quest my need help

392
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:02,928
you only need to call on me
That works but only once.!

393
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,688
Thanks.

394
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,065
But hurry, young man!

395
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,185
Wait! What is your name?

396
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,196
Merlin. As usual

397
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,666
You have attained the magic of healing.

398
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,134
chosen warriors, no doubt.

399
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,549
Los, Hamlet,

400
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,813
I was always on the side of the rabbit,

401
00:46:51,848 --> 00:46:54,437
me too.

402
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:03,534
What are you, My Lord An idea
does not go out of your mind?.

403
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,660
What do you think, as I
was the chosen warrior?

404
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,922
You gives you so chose I decided?

405
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,340
I just remember, that
I woke up in my village,

406
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:22,841
heard loud screams, and
nothing was the same again.

407
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:30,891
They were all dead Sounds to me like
you've got yourself since decided.

408
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:35,729
Anyway determined nobody except
ourselves, about our fate.

409
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,648
decide which route we take.

410
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:43,237
You really much smarter
than I thought, Brutus.

411
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:48,575
Thank you, My Lord
trying to sleep a bit..

412
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,961
I'll take the first
watch Whatever you want.

413
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:12,141
My Lady! Sit.

414
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:20,156
Samurai are beaten Yes.
I was sure you can do it

415
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,371

your visit I've missed you.

416
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,456
I missed? Yes.

417
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:33,586
Will you talk about
the topic possibly? No.

418
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:50,387
Awake The Amazons are on the march!

419
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,437
Awake We get visit. What to visit?

420
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:57,943
Who is coming? The Amazons
the lady warned me just now.

421
00:48:57,978 --> 00:49:00,404
Amazons? Not good, not good at all.

422
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,402
Come we disappear,

423
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:53,158
Los, drop your sword or
you will die on the spot

424
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,832
Drop it!

425
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,379
No, just not Hall mouth!

426
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,294
Or I Consume your tongue for breakfast.

427
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:09,306
better choice, you do what she says.

428
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:22,195
With whom I have the pleasure
I'm Hethera, Queen of the Amazons?.

429
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,822
That's all you need to know

430
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:33,289
sisters, obviously we have caught
this time a magnificent specimen.

431
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:39,337
He will give us heaven on earth
he is better than its predecessors.

432
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,333
So, I think we... Cubes
of it, who is the first turn.

433
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:53,801
The Chosen Warriors won on his
quest of power and strength.

434
00:50:53,836 --> 00:50:58,098
But that will not help him against
the unbridled fury of a woman

435
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,600
who feels scorned.

436
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:29,421
Where am I? We brought
you in our Amazon kingdom.

437
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,802
And what have! you done with my friend?

438
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:38,346
Seems pretty happy right now

439
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,850
What do you want from me?

440
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:47,192
The only thing that we women of
want you men, of course, your seed.

441
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:51,323
I will not do.

442
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,033
In your place I would think
the more difficult times.

443
00:51:56,488 --> 00:52:00,209
your mate says you're the
chosen warriors. Is that true?

444
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,630
it.

445
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,758
So warrior, you have two options

446
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,891
either, do you live with us, so often,

447
00:52:10,892 --> 00:52:13,722
pregnant until we are,
and that each of us!

448
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,184
Then we let you and your friend alive.

449
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,929
Or do us the honor verweigerst

450
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:24,225
and we fry your soft
parts on skewers, warrior.

451
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:28,358
No, attend you is me
impossible for what reason?

452
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:35,320
Because my heart already belongs to
another We would not want your heart.

453
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:42,327
Will you think about it Will not I?.

454
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:49,299
What a waste of pure lust.

455
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,839
Wait! Waits.

456
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,555
What do you want? Fight with me.

457
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:03,143
Why bother? I'll let you
kill and I'm done with you.

458
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,021
defeated all who came in Shoukalas name

459
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,817
you I was also defeated.

460
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:15,367
You beat yourself brave, but for
me it's absolutely irrelevant.

461
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:22,826
You have no honor, girls No
man would let me die like this..

462
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:27,622
But every woman has, in your
opinion It is what it is.

463
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:35,091
As you wish, we just fight.

464
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,572
Come on, finish him!

465
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,991
set your new king to be a man?

466
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,504
I thought 's me.

467
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:03,392
Thank you, My Lord! I think
I never want to eat goat meat.

468
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,141
Brutus... Although it
actually tastes great.

469
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,853
Brutus! Yes, My Lord Was
that also Shoukatas work?

470
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:13,436
Assume we have, he wants to no
case that you see him coming.

471
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:17,190
Then I want to search my not
rest until I've finally defeated.

472
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:24,989
Again a magical stone, My Lord.

473
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,754
Fate but says good cry with you.

474
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,837
Fate would have us today both
nearly killed. No, no, no.

475
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,426
That was just a challenge.

476
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:02,451
What did you I do not
know where we are, My Lord?.

477
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:09,997
We ask the lady of the forest,
the helps. Yes, she is.

478
00:56:10,032 --> 00:56:12,495
But how do we find this woman, then?

479
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,462
Then we'll just keep
marching and keep an eye out.

480
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:22,172
we have pork, they will
perhaps us. Whatever you say.

481
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:28,306
The guy is good.

482
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:33,395
This man who dares. to call themselves
before world "'s chosen warriors."

483
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:38,613
He is better than his predecessors
before him wanted my head.

484
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,824
But he's not good enough

485
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,153
Because now I know his secret,

486
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:50,158
I know that he by the mistress
of forest is protected.

487
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:52,952
The woman is absolutely crazy!

488
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,918
Cursed be the day she was born!

489
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,756
I promise you, they will learn

490
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,840
what a high price must be
paid for this insolence!

491
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:05,180
Come here. you whore

492
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,509
doves, My Lord?

493
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:13,390
No. What do you hope
this of the chosen ones?

494
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,235
I know...

495
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:24,992
The warrior is your strength
not cope in life, My Lord.

496
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:29,579
your Craves the spirits
of Mandinas, sire?

497
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:34,460
No. I have planned for
him something much better.

498
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:44,212
What awaits me now? The Legend
after probably the ghost of Mahdinas

499
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:48,845
The ghosts of Mandinas
What do you mean again?

500
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,561
From Shoukatas warriors
they feared most.

501
00:57:54,429 --> 00:58:00,311
And why These ghosts
can not be killed.

502
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,196
as they're already dead

503
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:07,739
not worry That's the
good news.. Oh yeah?

504
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:12,448
We need to find out just
how we can they kill again..

505
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:17,036
Very good. My Lord, so slow you
get out, how the wind blows here.

506
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:34,224
What is it? A monument to the
gods, a place where one prays.

507
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:40,017
A prayer for the lady of
the forest, what you mean?

508
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:47,737
You my ruler of the
forest I beg you for help!

509
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,907
Who else should I ask?

510
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,250
victims, My Lord... You
have to offer her something.

511
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,666
Sorry I made you an offer.

512
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:02,877
I can only offer one namely myself

513
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,877
What do I do with joy
if you help us again.

514
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:18,555
Now How can I help
you, my brave warrior?

515
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,442
It's about the spirit of
Mandinas No one can kill them.

516
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:26,192
No, they are invulnerable
because they are long dead.

517
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,733
But I know a spell that
of them back to life.

518
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,528
And then.. Then I make them ready.

519
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:36,369
Maybe Where can I find
this spell, My Lady.?

520
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:41,329
There is only one way you have
the mountains to the cavemen..

521
00:59:41,364 --> 00:59:45,130
If you have the defeated
you also get your magic.

522
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:48,840
Where can I find the cavemen
Hike south to the mountains?.

523
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:51,588
There you'll find the cave
entrance But go quickly.!

524
00:59:51,623 --> 00:59:54,762
The ghosts are already
underway Thank you, My Lady!.

525
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:06,354
You fool! No man can survive
a visit to the cavemen.

526
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,359
Even du

527
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,705
You know something about this man cave?

528
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:28,463
little Unfortunately, in the Book
of Wisdom is nothing about it.

529
01:00:28,498 --> 01:00:31,468
also not in the book
of people. Strange.

530
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:36,350
How far do we have to The mountains
are about one and a half days.

531
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:40,012
But I do not know if we are there

532
01:00:40,047 --> 01:00:42,480
Well What's next then?

533
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,191
Do not worry if we are
close enough find us.

534
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:52,070
Sure, My Lord will be all right.

535
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,665
What do you do when
this is over, is Brutus?

536
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:04,165
I have not quite understood the
question When everyone is defeated...

537
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,922
... together Shoukata
when the search is over

538
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:12,219
I'm not sure That's
never happened so far..

539
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:18,597
But I miss my family you have family?

540
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:23,184
Nothing special... A woman
and two small children.

541
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:27,399
But I want to see when
everything is over.

542
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:31,610
You were in this adventure have
frequently, right? That is true.

543
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,446
But it was never too late to...

544
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,952
Beating Shoukata

545
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:41,866
Exactly. The story will
run differently this time.

546
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:46,086
Do you believe me Yes, to who else?

547
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:52,343
Then we find out what is your destiny
Maybe you'll return to your family..

548
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,927
That would be nice.

549
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,460
We are probably there,
My Lord. We are where?

550
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:32,424
At the entrance to the cave
They live under the mountain.?

551
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,506
Yes, at night they come out

552
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,177
Until then, we wait here comfortably.

553
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:44,178
No, if there are more
inputs we miss them.

554
01:02:44,213 --> 01:02:46,600
My God, I do not want to wait!

555
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:51,110
I make them the hell. was
already clear that you say that.

556
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:55,070
Should I go with No, wait here?.

557
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,699
And you'll kill everything which
leaves the cave. Can you do that?

558
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:02,488
Yes, I get to go there
already Thank you

559
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:49,663
Wonderful the chosen
warrior comes to die.

560
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:17,335
My Lady! My Lady! Get up, Brutus.

561
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:20,634
Please tell me: what are you
doing here Comic question?.

562
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:23,007
your self but we have
sent into the mountains.

563
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:26,010
You speak in the plural,
though you're here all alone?

564
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:28,091
chosen warrior came with me.

565
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,977
And where is he? Because in the Cave

566
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,773
What does he want
only with the cavemen?

567
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:40,904
I want an answer! Instant My
Lady, You gave us yet even guess

568
01:05:40,939 --> 01:05:43,239
to hike in the mountains
and kill the caveman.

569
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,115
ways of life spell against the spirits
of Mandinas! I advised you before!

570
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:51,573
Then it was probably... Shoukata!

571
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:56,374
Please be brave you fear
the light.. Yes' My Lady.

572
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:09,697
nice. to see I'm just.

573
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:13,113
're sinister fellows
Yes, very true, thank you..

574
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:15,786
My pleasure What's the magic?

575
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:18,247
No magic, My Lord '
we both were cheated

576
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:27,218
From me out can we
go Good idea, Brutus.

577
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:56,698
My Lady The Lady of the
forest was here? Yes.

578
01:07:56,906 --> 01:08:00,206
I learned Shoukatas of deceit
and could come to your aid.

579
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:05,002
Again she gave me folded
life In the valley.

580
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:11,177
Now he defeated even the cavemen.

581
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:14,182
That can not be a mere mortal.

582
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:18,103
Maybe he's really the
chosen one, My Lord.

583
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:23,100
And maybe you wearing tonight
still the head on your shoulders

584
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:27,108
sending the spirits of
Mandinas immediately!

585
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:31,613
Yes, My Lord. We'll see how it's
chosen warriors now been made.

586
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:36,245
Already very soon we will see it.

587
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,121
He wills. you can free them, What?

588
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:48,466
You listening hard You
should the spirits blank

589
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:51,886
moment.

590
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:56,470
This should inherit my
wife and children. Please!

591
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,719
Agreed.

592
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,565
Come on the door.

593
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,893
Yes.

594
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:54,483
The Chosen Warrior is forewarned

595
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,868
And yet the question remains:

596
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:00,906
like that! He kill the
ghosts are already dead?

597
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:09,005
What are you, My Lord
I feel something?.

598
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,632
the breath of death.

599
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,193
Thank you.

600
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,446
A little bit of fear exciting, huh?

601
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:40,153
Yet another magical stone, My Lord

602
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:43,121
Fate says again good with you.

603
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:46,911
We owe the Lady of the
Forest no question.

604
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:04,936
Now I feel even more strongly That
was not to be overlooked, my friend.

605
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,376
And now we are looking
by the Lady of the

606
01:11:06,377 --> 01:11:07,597
Forest. Have tracked Soon the ghosts Us

607
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,756
to ask whether she knows
a spell of the power of

608
01:11:13,757 --> 01:11:16,023
the spirits of Mandinas
breaks. Yes, let's go.

609
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:25,532
We have little time, my lord. Right.

610
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:32,665
My Lady! I need you needed more
than ever! Please! Come to me.

611
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,049
I am here, my chosen one

612
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:43,133
Now you need from me to spell
to defeat the ghosts of Mandinas.

613
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:46,934
You might as well be
Shoukata and fooled me again.

614
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,189
Shoukata probably does
everything to avoid defeat.

615
01:11:50,224 --> 01:11:52,273
But what is it?

616
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:56,029
No, My Lady, the little well.

617
01:11:56,187 --> 01:12:00,237
Please excuse my suspicion
You've only acted very wisely.

618
01:12:00,272 --> 01:12:02,327
Shoukata your death
would be a feast of joy,

619
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,364
The ghosts of Mandinas are
already broken from his stronghold.

620
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:08,498
So we must hurry But My Lady!

621
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:11,709
The fortress lies a half days from
here This is not true for spirits.

622
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:15,874
This is the magic of Second Life,
he will breathe life into the ghosts.

623
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:19,465
This life can be taken from them,
it gives you exactly two minutes.

624
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,755
That means if you were
not fast enough to defeat

625
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:26,264
Your search sealed unfortunately
and your destiny. You have the magic

626
01:12:26,299 --> 01:12:28,057
obtained of Second Life.

627
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:33,516
me I give my life not mess of ghosts

628
01:12:33,551 --> 01:12:35,189
you are already there!

629
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,949
you die Do you not hope you will today.

630
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,054
Thank you.

631
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:29,974
You did it but only
with your help, My Lady!.

632
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,810
Greif, this is your reward.

633
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,847
The last of the magic stones, My Lord.

634
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:51,654
You have achieved far more
than any man reached before you.

635
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:56,247
It is still not the time to celebrate
It is time for the undisputed victory..

636
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,585
You can not defeat me, warriors Not you

637
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,123
Especially not today Woe
to you on what you're doing.

638
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:05,091
So what? Then what?
Then you'll kill me?

639
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:07,504
But before I die I'll cut her throat..

640
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,672
Then I am indeed dead but
the woman is there too!

641
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:13,096
Do not worry about me, my
love, I will live forever.

642
01:15:13,131 --> 01:15:16,312
Let's bring it here to
the end of you and me.

643
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:20,267
I promise you, we will.

644
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:24,236
What is this? Where have they gone?

645
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:30,284
you go, My Lord Presumably
they are in Shoukatas fortress..

646
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:36,241
You know where that is? In the north
. Then we need also to the north.

647
01:15:36,276 --> 01:15:39,244
No need to rush, My Lord the
lady said, it will survive.

648
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:42,960
She said it will survive, but
Shoukata could use a torturemagic

649
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,793
That would be possible, my lord.

650
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:49,591
I have no choice I must save her.

651
01:15:49,626 --> 01:15:52,223
There would only be
a small thing What?

652
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,884
It is written Shoukata
can only be defeated

653
01:15:54,919 --> 01:15:58,310
a fighter with a flaming
sword! Where can I find it?

654
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:01,519
According to legend it is kept
between the heavens and the earth.

655
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:07,278
This means on top of the mountain
Sounds convincing, My Lord...

656
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:10,908
How long will it take to the summit
The journey is arduous and dangerous?.

657
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:14,243
We need at least ten days, I'm afraid.

658
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:17,703
This is not a good plan
We need another way..

659
01:16:17,738 --> 01:16:19,996
You make me fun and
we would need hill.!

660
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,128
You're absolutely right, my friend.

661
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:27,918
I have an idea as I have
absolutely right? With what do?

662
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:31,921
Although 'the adventure
comes to an end,

663
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,932
although the warrior
his victory gets closer,

664
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:39,141
Shoukata keeps the whole
obviously still for a game

665
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:47,278
There's he.

666
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:52,825
My Lord, he could destroy
you I do not think.

667
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:57,989
Take the sword And wish me luck,

668
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,449
Okay.

669
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,698
Who dares come so close to me?

670
01:17:18,733 --> 01:17:21,015
I am he, the chosen warriors.

671
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:24,474
You're back around you
put me in battle, or.?

672
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:28,398
Very brave me anyway was a bit boring.

673
01:17:28,433 --> 01:17:30,945
No, I do not even want to fight you.

674
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:34,655
but plays no role step one step closer.

675
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:38,324
And I attack you Thus
happens to be the rules..

676
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:41,832
Look at me. I am unarmed Now what?

677
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:44,744
man, what do you want from me '?

678
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:50,209
Now, I ask you for a favor fly
with me to the mountain top!

679
01:17:50,244 --> 01:17:52,960
I absolutely need the flaming sword.

680
01:17:52,995 --> 01:17:57,807
You really beat that a perfectly
