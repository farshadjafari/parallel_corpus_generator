what they were talking about.

Okay. Your turn.

why couldn't you write about the real raccoons?

715
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:05,961

not a nature book.

Oh, the Cherry Lane Theatre is the oldest
continuously running theater off-Broadway.

753

from a box factory in 1924...

and-and then in the '20s and '30s and '40s...

it presented the work of writers
such as F. Scott Fitzgerald...

Julian Beck and Judith Malina's
Living Theatre was based here.

761

Oh, oh! In 1952, Judith Malina chased
a fire marshal down the street...

with a spear from her production of <i>Ubu Roi.</i>
