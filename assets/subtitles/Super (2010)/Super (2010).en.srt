1,271 --> 00:00:23,647
I've had two perfect moments in my life.

2
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,442
The first was when I married Sarah.

3
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,324
The other, I was downtown...

4
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,536
He went in there, Officer!

5
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,329
Thanks, pal.

6
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,666
Two perfect moments...

7
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,169
which offset a life of pain.

8
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,338
Would God hide pictures of Heather Locklear

9
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,258
in His closet, Frank?

10
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,762
A life of humiliation.

11
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,096
And rejection.

12
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,607
Oh, yeah.

13
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,333
What are those?

14
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,628
I'll wake up and see these first thing every morning.

15
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,797
My perfect moments.

16
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,465
They can inform my day,

17
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,219
set me in the right direction.

18
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,553
The hands are a little big,

19
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,306
don't you think, sweetheart?

20
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,121
Frank.

21
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,289
I don't want to snuggle.

22
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,542
I knew I was losing her.

23
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,843
Honey...

24
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,177
Close the fucking door.

25
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,347
Doof.

26
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,141
I should have done something about it then,

27
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,477
saved Sarah from what was about to come.

28
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,480
Crunch!

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,861
But I was weak.

30
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,957
Hey.

31
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,293
Sarah live here?

32
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,295
Uh, she's not home right now.

33
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,967
Hey, what are you cooking there, pal, eggs?

34
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,138
Sounds pretty good right about now.

35
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,600
Do you think maybe I could have a couple of those babies?

36
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,737
Are these some special kind of eggs?

37
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,405
Are these those... those brown kind?

38
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,407
I don't know what those are.

39
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,575
No.

40
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,243
Well, they're fucking fantastic.

41
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,745
I mean, my God.

42
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,582
You, my friend, you have an egg-cooking gift.

43
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,668
God has graced you with a goddamn egg-cooking gift.

44
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,173
Whoa. Horse is at the gate.

45
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,674
Got to run.

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,176
Do me a favor, buddy.

47
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,012
Will you tell Sarah that Jacques stopped by?

48
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,805
Okay.

49
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,811
Amazing eggs. Really.

50
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,156
She was gone five days later.

51
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,465
People look stupid when they cry.

52
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,622
- All right, girls, break's up. Back to work.

53
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,624
Jock?

54
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,376
Excuse me. Jock.

55
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,710
Yeah? - I'm sorry to bother you.

56
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,837
Have you seen my wife?

57
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,505
They say she doesn't work here anymore.

58
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,382
Oh, depends on who your wife is.

59
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,342
Sarah! Sarah.

60
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,261
Oh, yeah, you're the guy that cooks eggs, right?

61
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,429
The brown kind?

62
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,763
Yeah, yeah. They weren't brown.

63
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,348
Oh, that's right. They weren't brown.

64
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:17,060
That's right. - Have you seen my wife?

65
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,562
Shit. Yes.

66
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,230
Yeah, I've seen her.

67
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,566
And I know this is hard, man,

68
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,735
but I don't think... oh...

69
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,572
I don't think she wants to see you anymore.

70
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,240
What?

71
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,243
Oh, buddy.

72
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,370
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,765
Yo, Frank, you're burning 'em.

74
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,434
Come on, man.

75
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,440
That's how people get cancer,

76
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,610
from eating burnt burgers, man.

77
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,279
Frank, man, you got to forget about that bitch.

78
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,114
That's a fucking whore.

79
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,949
She sucked more dick than my brother Victor,

80
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,827
and you saw that faggot come in here once with a cum worm on his beard.

81
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,162
Didn't even know it was there.

82
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,331
How you don't know somebody jizzed on your face?

83
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,167
Don't talk about her that way. Okay?

84
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,502
You're lazy.

85
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,712
I'm the one who does all the cooking around here anyway.

86
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,548
So? - I know.

87
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,218
That dog who was banging her, that Jacques,

88
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,719
Quintell say he's bad fucking news.

89
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,554
You wanna fuck around with a guy like that, you?

90
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,724
Come on, man.

91
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,228
Just get that bitch out your mind, okay?

92
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,729
What's this?

93
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,689
Jock. - The guy I was telling you about.

94
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,525
He stole my wife. - Mm-hmm.

95
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,485
Can you arrest him?

96
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,529
What kind of proof do you have that he kidnapped her?

97
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,074
I asked him where she was, and he was evasive.

98
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,993
He wouldn't answer any questions.

99
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,496
Doesn't sound like proof, Mr. Darbo.

100
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,664
How long has she been missing?

101
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,748
Three days.

102
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,375
How did you discover she was gone?

103
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,043
Her closet was empty.

104
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,378
So this guy Jock kidnapped her

105
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,171
and took all of her clothes out of her closet?

106
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,506
And drugs.

107
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,466
She's a recovering alcoholic and drug addict.

108
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,134
She was really turning her life around,

109
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,178
and then this jerk gave her drugs.

110
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,514
So she kidnapped herself

111
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,432
and took her own clothes out of the closet.

112
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,768
What, is this guy, like, one of these Vegas hypnotists?

113
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,436
No, no. That's not what I'm saying.

114
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,273
Look, Mr. Darbo, what you're telling us is that

115
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,277
your wife left you for this guy Jock.

116
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,820
And now you want us to arrest him.

117
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:32,988
Yes.

118
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,615
We can't do that, Mr. Darbo.

119
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,117
Listen, pal, sometimes it's better

120
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,952
just to accept these things.

121
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,454
Sometimes the best way to forget about someone you care about

122
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:47,127
is to fill the void with someone you don't quite so much.

123
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,467
Yeah, all kinds of rabbits.

124
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,595
Angora, lop-eared...

125
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,054
One missing a leg. That one's free.

126
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,057
'Cause I heard that they make good...

127
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,475
companion animals.

128
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,144
Absolutely, they do.

129
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,813
I mean, not a lot of people know this,

130
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,316
but you can train a rabbit to use a little litter box,

131
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,984
which makes them better than cats.

132
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,238
Their faces aren't as flat and freakish-looking.

133
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,451
Now, she's a real cutie.

134
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,624
Here you go.

135
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,045
What do you think?

136
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,088
Is she the right pet for you?

137
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,176
I better not.

138
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,262
'Cause if I screw it up...

139
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,184
Thanks.

140
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,788
We shouldn't have given Grandpa that Red Bull.

141
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,875
Return to The Holy Avenger on The All Jesus Network.

142
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,378
Demonswill, are you the one responsible

143
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,882
for the laziness of the boys and girls here at Valley High?

144
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,342
That's right, Holy Avenger.

145
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,678
I've been bathing their apple crisp and Tater Tots

146
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,390
in the Beam of Sloth.

147
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,143
But I don't like apple crisp or Tater Tots, Holy Avenger.

148
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,479
And I pack a lunch.

149
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,481
That's why the two of us haven't been affected

150
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,983
and have continued to do our schoolwork and chores.

151
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,485
More importantly,

152
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,153
you're the only ones who have remembered

153
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,364
that it's more important to fight evil in all its forms,

154
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,034
rather than just give in to Satan because it's easier that way.

155
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,372
You'll never stop me!

156
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,541
That's right. I won't.

157
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,503
But the power of Jesus Christ, our Savior, will.

158
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,428
Get him, Jesus!

159
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,512
Yeah!

160
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,390
Thanks, Jesus!

161
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,021
Oh, greet the morning.

162
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,190
Shotgun. Here we go, baby.

163
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,238
Obviously you have no regard for the U.S. Constitution, Abe.

164
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,073
What? - Shotgun is in there.

165
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,045
Sarah!

166
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,047
Oh, no. Again with this guy?

167
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,883
Sarah, come with me. - Frank?

168
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:40,884
What? - Let's go.

169
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,260
Come on, Sarah. Come home with me.

170
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,345
Where are we going? - They've turned you against me.

171
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,346
Boss? - Get in the car.

172
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,347
Let's go! - No!

173
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,390
Sarah, please! - Hold on.

174
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,391
Let go!

175
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,726
Oh, Sarah, look at your pupils.

176
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,894
They're dilated. - Frank...

177
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,228
What have they done to you, Sarah?

178
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,438
Frank, Frank, let go.

179
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,856
Come on, buddy. This isn't right.

180
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,441
You're hurting me!

181
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,567
Come on! - Back off.

182
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,902
Hey, buddy, back off.

183
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,737
Sarah, no! What are you doing?

184
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,738
No!

185
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,739
Come on!

186
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,157
You okay? - Yeah.

187
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,492
Don't listen to him!

188
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,161
Do not listen to him! Don't listen to him!

189
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,164
Hey, hey, hey. Why are you hitting my car?

190
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,415
That's seriously fucked up.

191
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,958
Give her back to me! - What?

192
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,251
Baby, Jacques, it's okay.

193
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,628
It's Frank. It's okay. He's fine...

194
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,629
Oh, Sarah, shut up.

195
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,630
No, you shut up!

196
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,967
All right, pal, haven't I been nice to you?

197
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,302
I mean, I've been nice, right?

198
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,304
I complimented your cooking.

199
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,139
You don't know who I am,

200
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:32,310
so I'm gonna give you one last warning,

201
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,312
out of the fucking kindness of my fucking heart.

202
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,482
Don't fucking touch my car again.

203
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,579
That is the last time.

204
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,252
Frank!

205
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,586
I'm going.

206
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,213
That's not the kind of touching I meant.

207
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,847
No! No! Sarah!

208
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,181
Sarah!

209
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,349
Come here! - No!

210
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,351
Some kind of stalker or something, buddy?

211
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,228
Get off the car!

212
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,242
Come here.

213
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:51,931
God, please guide me.

214
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,766
Tell me what to do.

215
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,102
I hate you, God.

216
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,605
I'm sorry I said that.

217
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,941
It just seems so unfair, God.

218
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,444
Other people have goodness.

219
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,778
They have good things.

220
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,780
They have love and tenderness,

221
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,451
people who care about their lives.

222
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:16,289
They're not humiliated at every turn.

223
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,291
Other people have things, God.

224
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,168
Even the starving children in Africa,

225
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:24,172
even their parents love them.

226
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,591
Why was I so unlucky

227
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,094
to have my soul born into this disgusting me?

228
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,430
This ugly face,

229
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:36,267
this hair, this hair that doesn't comb,

230
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,771
and this dumb, idiotic personality?

231
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,439
Other people stare at me, God.

232
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,274
I can tell.

233
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,609
They are amazed at how

234
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,112
something so stupid and idiotic can even exist.

235
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,200
Why am I that?

236
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,417
Please, God.

237
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,752
I just want this one thing.

238
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,087
I'll ask for one thing.

239
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,797
I'll never ask for anything ever again.

240
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,924
Please.

241
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:17,850
Let Sarah be my Sarah again.

242
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,149
Amen.

243
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,704
I have been plagued by visions throughout my life.

244
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,039
At the age of eight,

245
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,374
I saw Jesus sitting on my wall.

246
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,210
- Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal.

247
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,378
Why does everybody

248
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,464
take everything so seriously all the time?

249
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,632
At 12, I discovered

250
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,469
my friend Johnny Stockwell wasn't all he appeared to be.

251
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,974
And when I first met Sarah, I heard the words of God.

252
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,142
Marry her.

253
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,853
I have never known if these visions

254
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,522
were divinely implanted or something else.

255
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,234
But I never experienced anything...

256
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,736
like this.

257
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,207
The finger of God.

258
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,375
What?

259
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,712
Touching your brain.

260
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:37,550
The tiniest tip of the tiniest tip

261
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,052
of the finger of God.

262
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,221
Even that is too much

263
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,392
for a human being's peanut mind to comprehend.

264
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,477
There's a plan for you, Frank.

265
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:53,191
Some of His children are chosen.

266
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,358
Okay?

267
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,360
Okay.

268
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:00,591
Can I help you with something in particular?

269
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,593
Holy Avenger.

270
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,761
The Avengers?

271
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,596
No.

272
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,599
Holy Avenger.

273
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,601
Oh, Holy Avenger.

274
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,062
Jeez, do you always mumble like that?

275
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,693
Back issues under H. Right there.

276
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,619
Holy Avenger. What a cunt.

277
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:32,123
Hold this, asshole.

278
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,126
Oh, the cook.

279
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,795
Yeah, you're the cook at the diner.

280
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,588
I eat lunch there all the time.

281
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,507
Tuna avocado salad?

282
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,175
Do you remember me?

283
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,176
No.

284
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,470
Really?

285
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,264
Are you really into this Christ-y shit?

286
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,224
I've never read it before.

287
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,892
Well, dude...

288
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,060
God, I got to warn you

289
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,104
that this is pretty fucking stupid.

290
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,605
Well, I mean, unless you're laughing

291
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,274
at how gay it is, 'cause then it's awesome.

292
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Okay.

293
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,776
I mean, just look at this artwork.

294
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,278
They look like a bunch of mongoloids.

295
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,446
You know what I mean?

296
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,448
How mongoloids' eyes are like that?

297
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,116
Speaking of mongoloids,

298
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,119
just how fucking crazy would it be to be a midget?

299
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,620
Just fucking crazy.

300
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,374
I don't understand how you'd operate at all.

301
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,834
Can I just buy it?

302
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,337
Listen, "I'm no different from you or anyone else, Holly.

303
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,671
"All it takes to be a superhero

304
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,674
is the choice to fight evil."

305
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,177
Actually, the guy's kind of got a point.

306
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,845
I mean, I wonder all the time

307
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,389
why no one's ever just stood up and become a real superhero.

308
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,700
"All it takes to be a superhero

309
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:53,037
is the choice to fight evil."

310
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,040
It was all so clear.

311
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,210
Maybe I couldn't shoot beams out of my eyes or fly,

312
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,712
but the finger of God had touched me.

313
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,381
And who's to say what kind of powers

314
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,216
that gives a person?

315
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,676
Jock had stolen Sarah,

316
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,597
propelling me into the depths of hell itself.

317
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,933
But in those depths,

318
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,062
I became myself for the first time ever.

319
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,026
I found my skin.

320
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,362
Everybody give up.

321
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,197
It's me, The Crimson Bolt.

322
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,575
You just made the biggest mistake of your life.

323
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,245
Shut up, crime.

324
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,415
Here's The Crimson Bolt,

325
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,166
crime.

326
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:45,548
Crimson Bolt's journal. Night one.

327
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:49,552
Waiting to protect innocents

328
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:53,013
from the dark forces of evil.

329
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,825
Crimson Bolt's journal. Night two.

330
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,494
There was no crime last night.

331
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,413
I did, however, see a few suspicious characters

332
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,915
who might have been planning something for to-

333
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,250
Hold on!

334
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,067
It was just a box.

335
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,736
The wind was pushing it down the street.

336
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,664
I'm not gonna just leave it there.

337
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,874
I'll pick it up later.

338
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,417
I just don't want to expose my position

339
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,711
at this time.

340
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,215
Hello.

341
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,549
I'm a college student,

342
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:15,054
and I'm doing a report on where to buy drugs...

343
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,891
the streets where all the drug dealers are.

344
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,643
You're writing a report on that?

345
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,061
Yes.

346
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,146
Why are you wearing a fake beard?

347
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,649
It's real.

348
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,692
Just my hair...

349
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,029
growing out of my face.

350
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,532
Oh, well, I guess we can just start

351
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,534
by checking the internet for old news stories.

352
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,327
A lot of people think it's fake, but it's not.

353
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,662
It's real.

354
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,664
They wanted me to be a real-beard Santa

355
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,792
'cause of how real my beard was.

356
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:51,465
But I was like, "No, I have to write this report."

357
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,271
Yo, brothers.

358
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,438
What I do you for? Some smoke?

359
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,439
You got any weed?

360
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,482
Fuck yeah, dog.

361
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,150
Got the motherfucking Thai stick.

362
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,695
This is what you good-looking brothers need for a party.

363
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,862
Pussy comes from miles away

364
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,573
when they smell this Thai stick, you know?

365
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,409
Bet the two of y'all get a lot of pussy, don't you, huh?

366
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,077
Yeah. - Our share.

367
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,203
I knew it. I can tell.

368
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,329
What do you say, man? Hmm?

369
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,624
Thai stick, dude. We got to.

370
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,297
Dude.

371
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,174
What the hell?

372
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,759
Dope-pushing scum!

373
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,927
Get out of here, man!

374
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,637
Dude, I think this is just sunflower seeds

375
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,680
glued to popsicle sticks.

376
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,015
Go! Go, go-go-go-go!

377
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,563
Why are you doing this to me?

378
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,108
No fair!

379
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,944
No! No fair!

380
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,487
Thud!

381
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,661
Clang!

382
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,330
Hey, motherfucker!

383
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,664
Yo-yo-yo!

384
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,166
Yo, you better get off our boy, man.

385
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,169
Yo, Nathaniel, what the hell?

386
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,172
You better run, superbug!

387
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,304
Hey.

388
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,972
Yeah, I'm looking for comic books

389
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,974
with superheroes without powers.

390
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,726
Superheroes without powers?

391
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:26,894
Yeah, they have to use,

392
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,229
you know, weapons to defend themselves.

393
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,191
All right. Yeah. Okay.

394
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,359
Batman.

395
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,861
Batarang, pipe bombs, utility belt.

396
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,029
Utility belt?

397
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,198
Green Arrow has a bow and arrow.

398
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,699
Okay.

399
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,534
Captain America has a shield.

400
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,662
Shield... - No, wait-wait-wait!

401
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,829
No, he has powers.

402
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:46,997
He has powers.

403
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,582
God.

404
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,251
Sorry, you know, he's a supersoldier, so...

405
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,252
Okay.

406
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,253
Don't take that one.

407
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,254
Okay.

408
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,007
Catwoman has a whip.

409
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,676
There's Iron Man.

410
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,345
Now, Iron Man doesn't really have superpowers, per se,

411
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,138
but he's in a superpowered suit.

412
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,973
Does that count?

413
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,642
I think I have enough.

414
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,852
I almost didn't say it, but then I did.

415
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,063
I'm such an idiot.

416
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,565
Why do you need all those?

417
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,109
Research.

418
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,821
I'm making up my own superhero.

419
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,322
He needs a weapon.

420
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,783
Cool.

421
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,086
That'll do.

422
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,556
Oh, no.

423
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,058
Thwack!

424
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,102
Yo, man!

425
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,828
Oh, my neck!

426
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,346
Clang!

427
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,681
Oh!

428
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,938
Gracias, Mister.

429
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,835
Don't steal.

430
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,921
Don't molest kids.

431
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,465
Don't deal drugs.

432
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,718
Shut up, crime!

433
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,063
What?

434
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,617
Yes!

435
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,716
Hey, Frank.

436
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,260
Um, do you think you could do me a favor

437
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,928
and give me a ride to my meeting?

438
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:34,099
My PO's gonna kill me if I miss again.

439
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:38,270
That's when I need to give myself a little KISS, you know?

440
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,440
"Keep It Simple, Stupid."

441
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,233
My sponsor has been great

442
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,277
about helping me to stay grounded.

443
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,614
Well, then after spending that week in jail,

444
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,282
I just... I mean...

445
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,950
man, I don't ever want to go back

446
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,286
to any place like that ever again.

447
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,956
It's been two months now.

448
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,208
I'm gonna stay sober this time.

449
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,794
I really am.

450
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,298
Happy, joyous, and free all the way.

451
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,425
You know what I mean?

452
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,056
I've never really been happy,

453
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,350
not even when I was a little girl.

454
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,185
It's funny.

455
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:24,191
I kind of think happiness is... overrated.

456
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,693
People spend their whole lives chasing it,

457
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,030
like it's the most important thing in the world.

458
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:34,409
Happy people are kind of...

459
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,577
arrogant.

460
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,999
What?

461
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,085
Do people tell you you're weird, Frank?

462
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,173
Yeah.

463
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,470
Yeah, I guess you kind of are.

464
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:58,642
Also, you're different to other guys I've known.

465
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:02,479
You're... good.

466
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,114
Come here.

467
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,783
What?

468
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,951
I want to try something.

469
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,119
What?

470
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,746
Come here.

471
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,601
You can't be happy for me?

472
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,269
I am happy for you, Sarah.

473
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,437
I just know that...

474
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,940
Fuck, you've always been like this.

475
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,608
Even when we were kids, you were like this.

476
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,276
No, Sarah. - Yes.

477
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,611
It's just fast.

478
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,612
Fast?

479
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,114
You just got sober after how long?

480
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,740
I mean, what is it that they say

481
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,409
about not making any major decisions for a year?

482
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,411
Nothing against Frank.

483
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,996
Nothing against you, Frank.

484
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,164
Okay.

485
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,041
Why can't you just be happy for me?

486
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,209
For us?

487
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,877
That is something they say on TV.

488
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,129
See? That is what I mean.

489
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,630
You just cull together

490
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,924
all these things you hear other people say

491
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,384
and put them together into something

492
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,760
you think is a personality.

493
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:39,761
You are a real bitch.

494
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,763
Sarah!

495
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,266
What if I know, Jennifer?

496
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,601
What if I know?

497
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,019
You want me to get my life together?

498
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,020
You want me to change?

499
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,021
Sarah...

500
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,273
What if Frank is the only thing

501
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,440
that will save me?

502
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,567
What then?

503
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,032
The brutal assaults by the costumed man

504
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,701
calling himself The Crimson Bolt

505
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,369
continued last night

506
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,330
when he sent 42-year-old Gerard Mavin to the hospital

507
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,540
with a fractured collarbone.

508
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,708
Fuck. Check this shit out.

509
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,459
Witnesses say this unusual criminal

510
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,461
who wears a superhero costume

511
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,548
attacked Mavin without provocation.

512
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,716
A lot of people in this city

513
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,385
are finding this situation amusing.

514
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,720
But it's not a big leap

515
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,722
for a psychopath to go from serial beatings

516
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,223
to serial murders.

517
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,058
The DPD has asked for your help

518
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,060
in finding The Crimson Bolt.

519
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,438
He's described as a muscular Caucasian,

520
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,107
about 6'5" with dark eyes.

521
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,067
Anyone with information please call...

522
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,736
Fuck.

523
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,988
Must be some sort of sex thing with this motherfucker, huh?

524
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:40,989
What?

525
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,824
No.

526
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,827
I mean, I don't know.

527
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:46,995
Doesn't even interest me.

528
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:47,996
First I've heard of it.

529
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:48,997
What?

530
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,498
Yeah, news to me. Huh...

531
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,833
How could you not hear it, Frank?

532
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,084
That's all they been talking about.

533
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,669
This crazy motherfucker dressed like Superman

534
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,837
is whacking people with a pipe wrench

535
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:56,838
all over the city.

536
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,007
Just boom! You're down.

537
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,176
Maybe they deserve to get whacked.

538
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,469
Deserve it?

539
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,638
Yeah, I heard that the people he's hitting,

540
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,933
they're the real criminals.

541
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,768
You just said you never heard of him, Frank.

542
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,605
I didn't. I haven't.

543
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,606
He just said it.

544
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,732
No, he didn't.

545
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,735
I just watched the whole thing with you.

546
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,029
I thought I heard him say that.

547
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,030
You're like a monkey.

548
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,033
I'm not like a monkey.

549
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,868
Hey, me and Tish going to the movies tomorrow.

550
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:27,869
You wanna meet us there?

551
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,371
No, I got stuff to do.

552
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,872
What, Frank? What?

553
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,707
What do you gotta do?

554
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,875
Nothing.

555
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,211
Good, then you can get there early,

556
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,046
hold a place for us in line, okay?

557
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,384
Come on. Come on.

558
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,551
Okay.

559
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,095
I'll take you to the movies, all right?

560
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,429
My treat. Shake it off, all right?

561
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,430
Got to get out more, baby.

562
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,266
Always kissing me.

563
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,433
Weird.

564
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,851
Order up.

565
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,979
Three, please.

566
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,457
I beg... If I could just...

567
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,459
Oh, come on!

568
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,128
Oh, no, he didn't.

569
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,630
Why do people have to do that?

570
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,632
We've been waiting here forever.

571
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,761
I mean, it's important that you realize that

572
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,763
there's, like, a sailor's hat involved.

573
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,931
Like an actual-

574
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,141
Sailor's hat?

575
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,311
Hey, excuse me.

576
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,772
Hey! No butts.

577
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,274
What difference does it make to you?

578
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,275
Yeah, man.

579
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,776
No butting in line.

580
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,945
Go to the back of the line now.

581
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,280
Yeah.

582
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,116
Go fuck yourself.

583
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,117
Fuck yourself.

584
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,578
Yeah.

585
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,455
Like, you know, this big handsome guy back here,

586
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,789
he looks like fucking shit.

587
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,458
Literally, what's wrong with his face?

588
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,502
I don't know if it's flat or wide or-

589
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,629
Anyway...

590
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,886
Mommy.

591
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,263
Annie, come on.

592
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,143
Don't butt!

593
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,478
Who do you think you're fooling?

594
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,479
I just saw you...

595
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,480
crunch!

596
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,981
Oh, my God! - Oh, God!

597
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,149
Oh, no! - Wait...

598
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,485
Oh, God! Get off him!

599
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,819
What the hell are you doing, you...

600
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,821
You butted too!

601
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,163
Oh, God, Stop him! Someone stop him!

602
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,796
Hey. Have you seen this?

603
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:43,880
It's weird.

604
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,382
What?

605
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,175
It's just what we talked about last week.

606
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,886
I mean, you have to admit, remember?

607
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:50,887
No.

608
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,848
A guy who... can I just...

609
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,558
Can I come back there?

610
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,726
What?

611
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,228
Can I just come back there with you?

612
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,396
We're friends, so...

613
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,563
No.

614
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,357
I'll wear those plastic gloves.

615
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,484
Kitchen door's right there, sweetheart.

616
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,197
Maybe she's fixing to ask you to prom, Frank.

617
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,199
I don't know her.

618
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,617
I mean, come on. Remember?

619
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,369
No.

620
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,037
His name is The Crimson Bolt.

621
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,205
And he just...

622
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,874
like, he just uses a wrench as a weapon.

623
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,209
I mean, somebody did it.

624
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,919
Somebody became a real one.

625
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:27,715
That sounds like a crazy man.

626
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,384
I'm Libby, by the way.

627
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,010
Hello.

628
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,638
Don't go making some joke about "Libby's on your label,"

629
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,142
'cause it just... it pisses me off.

630
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,351
What's your name?

631
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,561
Frank.

632
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,771
Oh, man.

633
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,107
I hope you'll be frank with me.

634
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,775
I hope you'll continue to be frank

635
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,110
in all of our future discussions.

636
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,403
Wait.

637
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,155
You just asked me to not make fun of your name,

638
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,656
and then you just made fun of my name.

639
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,991
I got something for you.

640
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,159
What is it?

641
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,827
You should come.

642
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:56,995
It's gonna be rad.

643
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,081
Lots of really awesome people.

644
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,838
Are you him?

645
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:07,839
What?

646
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,674
Are you the guy?

647
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,342
Are you this guy?

648
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,303
No.

649
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,764
It's okay if you are.

650
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:17,932
No, I'm not him.

651
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:21,936
No.

652
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,605
It's cool.

653
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,774
I hate when people butt.

654
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,527
I got a lot of work to do.

655
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,654
We're really busy right now.

656
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,813
Put your hands behind your head, you freak!

657
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,830
Frank Darbo.

658
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,332
Detective John Felkner.

659
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,833
Hello.

660
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,337
You filed a report with me a couple weeks ago.

661
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,506
You mind if I come inside for a sec?

662
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,840
Inside the house?

663
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:37,637
It's just a bit chilly. Yeah.

664
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,271
Thanks.

665
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,107
Oh, thanks.

666
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:53,778
So you filed that report.

667
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,781
Now, you and I came together to the conclusion

668
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:02,453
that your wife wasn't kidnapped, and she left you.

669
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:07,417
Is there something in there?

670
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,418
What?

671
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,712
Is that a basement?

672
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,547
That's a closet.

673
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,049
You just keep looking over there.

674
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,634
No, I... No, I don't.

675
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,969
Yeah, you do.

676
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,388
No. There's nothing in there.

677
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,724
All right.

678
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,727
There's a dog in there.

679
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,061
A dog?

680
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,439
Yeah.

681
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,898
You keep him in the closet?

682
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,942
I'm afraid he'll bite someone.

683
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,944
Oh, no, you don't have to worry about that with me.

684
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,195
I'm a dog person.

685
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,489
That's who he likes to bite the most.

686
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,075
Dog people.

687
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,496
Thank you for coming.

688
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:49,292
You're quite an intense fellow, there, Frank.

689
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,002
If you wouldn't mind signing this...

690
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,339
It basically just cancels out the charges.

691
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,674
I forgot to do it last time.

692
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,177
Captain is going through the change of life.

693
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,012
She had a conniption fit.

694
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,640
Just sign right here.

695
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,352
There we go.

696
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,187
All right. Thank you, Frank.

697
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,191
I'll let you get back to...

698
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,818
whatever it was you were doing.

699
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,087
God...

700
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,256
Did you really call me to be The Crimson Bolt,

701
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,927
or was that just in my head?

702
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,429
I don't want to go to prison

703
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:46,766
and be butt-raped and work in the library,

704
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,267
rolling those carts around

705
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:53,940
and handing out magazines for the rest of my life.

706
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:57,610
Isn't violence against the Bible?

707
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,780
God, please...

708
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:05,493
Give me a sign that I should continue being The Crimson Bolt.

709
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,161
Or if I should just throw everything away

710
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,329
before it's too late.

711
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,497
I'll even turn myself in,

712
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,165
if that's what you want me to do.

713
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:14,127
But please, don't want me to do that.

714
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,719
Okay, did you just say throw it all away,

715
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,179
or was that just me thinking throw it all away?

716
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,521
Okay, I'm gonna throw it all away.

717
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:39,026
If you don't want me to, please, give me a sign.

718
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:43,948
Maybe you could make something float.

719
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,074
Okay.

720
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,675
Easy turns with minimal effort...

721
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,010
That's right, Holly.

722
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,928
This is the gun that Demonswill used

723
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,930
to spread his lust dust over the school,

724
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,600
the very same lust dust that caused you and Jimmy

725
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,435
to dress in these provocative outfits

726
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,438
and download those pornographic images on your computer.

727
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,773
I'm so stupid.

728
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,441
Sex is a sacred act

729
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:21,110
that should only take place within a loving marriage.

730
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,612
No doubt.

731
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,323
My virginity is something to be proud of.

732
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,657
I'm gonna have these nipple rings

733
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,409
taken out tomorrow.

734
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,411
And to think I missed the field hockey game

735
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,289
all because Jim and I were heavy-petting.

736
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,124
Thank goodness we didn't do more.

737
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,626
If only the two of you

738
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,544
would have had premarital sexual intercourse,

739
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,879
then I would have won,

740
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,590
and you would be damned to hell forever.

741
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:45,593
But they didn't have intercourse, Demonswill.

742
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,762
You see, no matter how much peer pressure

743
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,096
Holly and Jimmy were under

744
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,848
to do what society said was right,

745
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,683
they knew in their hearts,

746
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,018
they couldn't throw away

747
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,146
what Jesus had called on them to do.

748
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,014
Fudge.

749
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,592
Toby, Toby, be careful, man.

750
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,094
And I don't want nothing missing.

751
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,263
So you want something missing?

752
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,431
What?

753
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,099
You just said a double negative, Abe.

754
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,601
You don't want nothing missing.

755
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,852
That means you want something missing.

756
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,896
Hey, these people,

757
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,481
this Range guy ain't gonna fuck around.

758
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,691
You know how hard it was

759
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,067
to get this shit into this country?

760
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,736
I know. - Well, good!

761
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,405
That hurt, Abe.

762
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,409
Okay, baby.

763
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,577
Thanks, brother.

764
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:35,912
Well, it all looks good.

765
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:36,954
I can tell you that.

766
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,040
Definitely.

767
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,709
You ready for this?

768
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,169
Okay, so this is kind of like

769
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,546
hitting the champagne bottle off the side of the boat, right?

770
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,424
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

771
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,183
Yeah, baby.

772
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,692
How do you feel?

773
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,862
Good?

774
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,574
Is that good?

775
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,575
That's good.

776
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,044
I love you. I love you so much.

777
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,129
I love you.

778
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,555
Oh, my beautiful angel.

779
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:44,230
You are so delicious.

780
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,986
What the fuck is that?

781
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,947
Face the wrath of The Crimson Bolt!

782
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,453
That's Sarah's husband, man. That's him.

783
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,080
Fuck, he saw everything. Go get him.

784
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,081
Go get him! Go on!

785
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,332
Go, go, go, go!

786
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,130
Come back here, motherfucker!

787
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:12,800
There.

788
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,555
You can't hide, Frank!

789
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,889
You're dead!

790
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,740
Go!

791
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,241
I got him! I got him!

792
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:35,883
This place is pretty cool.

793
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,384
You know what I'm saying?

794
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:45,726
Libby, somebody's here!

795
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,896
Libby!

796
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,397
She's such a whore. I swear.

797
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,566
Hang on just a second.

798
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,160
Libby, some guy who looks like a bum is at the front door.

799
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,372
His name's Frank. - Frank.

800
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,593
Frank?

801
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,095
Frank!

802
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,930
Why are you wearing garbage bags?

803
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,098
I need to talk to you.

804
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,266
Oh, okay.

805
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,976
Hey, everybody, this is Frank.

806
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:27,977
No. No. Please.

807
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,478
Frank, Molly.

808
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,105
Okay. - Christian.

809
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,106
Hey, what's up?

810
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,232
And Melissa. Will, Grant.

811
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,609
Hello. - Brian and Steve.

812
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:36,944
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

813
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,822
That is Mr. Jake hiding over there.

814
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,115
Okay, okay. Listen.

815
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,199
I need to talk to you.

816
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,536
It's important. Please.

817
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,457
Well, let's go back to my bedroom.

818
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,923
No, Christian.

819
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,635
What?

820
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:02,636
They're after me.

821
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,723
And I was shot.

822
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,683
Oh, my God.

823
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,269
Hey, Lib, babe, you okay?

824
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,353
Yeah.

825
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,354
Oh, my God. You're him.

826
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,355
I knew it.

827
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,690
This is so cool.

828
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,318
This is so fucking-

829
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,319
Are you gonna die?

830
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,987
I don't think so.

831
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,239
We got to clean this up.

832
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,241
I mean, we can't take you to the hospital

833
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,576
because this is a gunshot wound.

834
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,869
They'd have to call the police.

835
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:27,995
I mean, it's the law.

836
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,831
It's the law. I know.

837
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:31,999
Take off your pants.

838
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,668
No. Then I'd be in my underwear.

839
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:35,669
Look, just do it.

840
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,963
It's inappropriate.

841
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,633
I'll get them out of here. I won't say a thing.

842
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,719
My God. My hand is trembling.

843
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,057
Okay, bye.

844
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,393
Bye. See you.

845
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,728
Bye.

846
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:53,896
Libby, are you sure

847
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,439
you want to be here alone with this guy?

848
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,523
Yeah, I'm fine. It's good.

849
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,234
It's... something really important came up.

850
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,443
So I'm just gonna deal with it.

851
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,444
Yeah. You go. Yeah.

852
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,445
All right, good night.

853
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,738
Okay, Christian, you gotta go.

854
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,739
Okay, who is that guy?

855
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:04,907
Is that your sugar daddy?

856
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,283
I don't have to tell you anything.

857
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,701
You don't have to tell me anything?

858
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,036
No. - Okay, fine.

859
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,830
Well, you enjoy that candy that your sugar daddy buys you.

860
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,624
Oh, I will.

861
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:18,879
Wait. What are you doing?

862
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,089
I'm gonna get the bullet out.

863
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,590
No. It's clean.

864
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:22,925
It passed clean through.

865
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,593
No-no-no, but there's particles-

866
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,387
Just...

867
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,650
I'm sorry.

868
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,777
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

869
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,155
I should have used ibuprofens.

870
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,740
I was gonna use ibuprofens.

871
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,410
How were you gonna use ibuprofens?

872
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,869
What were you gonna do with them?

873
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,871
I'll wrap it.

874
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,623
I'm gonna wrap it. Here.

875
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:55,791
No, I'll do it.

876
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:56,792
I can...

877
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,169
Let me do it.

878
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:03,507
So am I the only one that knows you're him?

879
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,342
Yeah.

880
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,927
No, the guys who shot me, they know.

881
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,096
They know your secret identity?

882
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,097
Fuck!

883
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:13,767
Yeah. And where I live.

884
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,978
You can stay here.

885
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,606
Thank you.

886
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,526
No, I was there.

887
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:23,736
You told me you weren't there

888
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,987
when Robbie was shot.

889
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,323
I was there maybe for a minute, not much.

890
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,657
A minute? - Yeah.

891
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,326
It doesn't take a minute to get shot.

892
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,785
I know, I know, but it was like,

893
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,162
the guy was running out...

894
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,792
Holy crap.

895
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:53,098
Hello?

896
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,901
Anybody home?

897
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,905
Hello?

898
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,268
Welcome home, Frank.

899
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,399
Thud!

900
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,320
That's not him, you guys.

901
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,696
Then why did you shoot, man?

902
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:50,697
You shot!

903
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,032
I saw you move your finger.

904
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,534
You're gonna try to blame this on me.

905
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,701
That's fucking evil, man!

906
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,370
Would you shut up?

907
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,288
He's a cop?

908
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,625
I just did what he did, Abe.

909
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,627
If the cops are after Darbo,

910
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,878
and he saw the dope in...

911
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,380
Yeah, I know.

912
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,549
So can we get the body out of here, huh?

913
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,551
Move it.

914
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,053
Thanks, Hamilton. I will.

915
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,889
Okay. Good-bye.

916
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,724
Hey, Frank?

917
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,768
I told the diner that I had pneumonia.

918
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,104
You sure it's okay if I stay here?

919
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,772
Yeah, yeah.

920
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,066
I want to show you something.

921
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,987
What?

922
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,594
So what do you think?

923
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,929
Cartwheels.

924
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,097
Well, you see...

925
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,849
you see what I'm getting at here.

926
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,017
No.

927
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,019
Batman had Robin.

928
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,271
The original Human Torch had Toro.

929
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,857
The Flash had Kid Flash.

930
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,567
I could be your kid sidekick.

931
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:09,776
How old are you?

932
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,778
Well, I'm 22, you know.

933
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,615
But compared to you, I'm a one. I'm a kid, right?

934
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,283
I guess.

935
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,534
Right, now, look.

936
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,453
The most important thing, obviously, is the name.

937
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,454
All right.

938
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,622
And you got to think of it

939
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,790
like how it sounds with The Crimson Bolt.

940
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,292
All right?

941
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,669
So, um...

942
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:28,962
Okay.

943
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:33,300
The Crimson Bolt and Bolt Girl.

944
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:37,596
The Crimson Bolt and Kid Crimson.

945
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,061
The Crimson Bolt and The Creeping Bam.

946
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,646
What's a creeping bam?

947
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,814
What's a toro?

948
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,441
What the fuck is a robin?

949
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,817
A robin is bird.

950
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,319
Why is he named after a bird?

951
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,821
Because he...

952
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,449
he's loyal.

953
00:58:57,575 --> 00:59:01,453
Frank, The Creeping Bam is just this, like,

954
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:04,456
fantastic phrase, you know?

955
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,958
And I wasn't gonna tell you before,

956
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,042
but it's my favorite.

957
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,252
Oh, it's very good.

958
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,003
You're lying.

959
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,588
I don't need a kid sidekick.

960
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,048
Are you kidding me?

961
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,049
No.

962
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,175
Look what happens to you

963
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,344
when you don't have a kid sidekick.

964
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,180
You get shot by people.

965
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,849
Frank, you team up with me,

966
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,518
and I swear to fucking God

967
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,187
that we will take those cocksuckers down

968
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,564
that stole your wife.

969
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,445
Frank?

970
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,614
Yeah?

971
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,575
Are you ready?

972
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,576
Yeah.

973
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,578
May I present to you...

974
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:43,870
Boltie!

975
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,686
That's inappropriate.

976
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,065
How do I look?

977
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,233
It's good.

978
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:17,029
All right, Frank. Let's do this.

979
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,530
Let's go get this Jock fucker.

980
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,157
No. They have guns.

981
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,158
We're not ready yet.

982
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,996
Well, we can fight some other crime.

983
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,497
You know, you can show me how to do it.

984
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,499
You can give me the one-two.

985
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,003
No, my leg isn't healed yet.

986
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,921
Frank, don't be a pussy!

987
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,091
Come on!

988
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,926
I should do something about this.

989
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,762
You know what? I'm gonna get some snacks.

990
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,934
So this is what you do?

991
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:52,314
Yeah.

992
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,318
You just sit here and wait for crime to happen?

993
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,153
That's right.

994
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,837
This is so boring.

995
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,839
We gotta find a criminal, you know?

996
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,509
We gotta go out there, and we gotta find a criminal.

997
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,636
We gotta teach them a lesson that they'll never forget.

998
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,262
Like who?

999
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,475
Well, like this guy Jerry.

1000
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,310
He keyed my friend's car.

1001
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,978
I mean, he completely just...

1002
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,189
he just fucked the side of it right up.

1003
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:36,566
That's not cool.

1004
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,734
No, it is not.

1005
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,236
And it is illegal.

1006
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,738
And he never paid the price.

1007
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:47,786
Are you Jerry?

1008
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,830
Halloween was, like, a month ago, bro.

1009
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,665
That's him.

1010
01:01:56,045 --> 01:02:00,924
Yeah, Frank! Yeah, get him, Frank!

1011
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,928
Fucking cocksucker!

1012
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,098
Ow, my arm!

1013
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:12,060
Frank, it's just like when you got shot!

1014
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,734
Oh, my God, my face!

1015
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,654
No, no, stop! No! Stop! No, please!

1016
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,989
Boltie, no! - Stop, stop, stop.

1017
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:30,662
We did it! We did it!

1018
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,873
We totally fucking beat evil!

1019
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,208
You're not supposed to kill him!

1020
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:38,378
Oh, and then he'd never key a car again, would he?

1021
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,046
A brand-new fucking Jetta, Frank.

1022
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,381
Melissa loved that car.

1023
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:42,591
Don't say that.

1024
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:43,592
What, Frank? - Don't!

1025
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,094
Stop saying...

1026
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,558
He really keyed your friend's car?

1027
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:54,144
Yeah. Yeah, pretty sure it was him.

1028
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,566
Frank! What?

1029
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,401
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to kill him.

1030
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,736
I mean, I'm just learning.

1031
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,404
You have to teach me these things.

1032
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,989
How am I supposed to tell crime to shut up

1033
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:06,990
if I have to shut up?

1034
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:07,991
Look, I know!

1035
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,201
But I'm just trying to help!

1036
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,660
That's what it's all about for me,

1037
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,079
being a kid sidekick, helping people.

1038
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,581
That's helping people?

1039
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:15,749
And he was evil!

1040
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,250
He was so fucking evil!

1041
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:19,586
And you won't believe me, Frank!

1042
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,255
Frank, what does this mean?

1043
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,257
Does this mean that I'm fired?

1044
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:25,425
Yes.

1045
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:28,428
Who are you gonna get to be Boltie?

1046
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,263
I don't need a Boltie.

1047
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,141
God, you're so shallow, Frank.

1048
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,142
I need gas.

1049
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:36,102
This is lame.

1050
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,605
Frank, I'm in my underwear.

1051
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,649
Frank, this isn't cool.

1052
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:51,993
My grandmother or a corpse?

1053
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:53,495
Right, who would you rather fuck?

1054
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,205
Like, if somebody pointed a gun to your head

1055
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,206
and you had to choose?

1056
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,207
Who would do that?

1057
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,375
That's not the point.

1058
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,043
See, like, I'd do my grandma

1059
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,837
'cause at least she got a working pussy.

1060
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:02,838
You want smokes?

1061
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,261
That's the guy.

1062
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,689
Frank?

1063
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:05,483
Come on, man!

1064
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,484
What you doing?

1065
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:07,485
Yeah, 911?

1066
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:10,322
Get off!

1067
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:13,867
Fuck you, Frank.

1068
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:25,003
What is going on?

1069
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:31,760
Run! He's got a gun!

1070
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,604
That's what you get

1071
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,606
for fucking with The Crimson Bolt and Boltie,

1072
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,400
you stupid cocksucker!

1073
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,069
And now your legs are gone.

1074
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,864
Watch out.

1075
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,199
Come on.

1076
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,992
Oh, you too.

1077
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,161
It's called internal bleeding, fucker!

1078
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,704
And then you die!

1079
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:00,705
Get in!

1080
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,127
You tell everyone you know

1081
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,755
that any time some stupid fucking bastard

1082
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:11,091
wants to commit some gay-ass crime,

1083
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,259
that Crimson Bolt and Boltie are gonna be there

1084
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,637
to crush their little fucking evil heads in!

1085
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:31,236
The Boltmobile is kind of fucked up.

1086
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,405
I hope they didn't see the license plate.

1087
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:38,451
Hey, Frank.

1088
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:41,287
What?

1089
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:44,124
I saved your life.

1090
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,583
I could have handled it.

1091
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,085
Yeah, of course.

1092
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:50,797
You're fucking awesome, Frank.

1093
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:54,134
Hey, you want to be my sidekick,

1094
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,301
no cussing.

1095
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:58,263
Right. No, I agree.

1096
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,476
Does that mean I'm not fired anymore?

1097
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,315
We need to get Jock,

1098
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,152
but we need better weapons.

1099
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:13,987
I could get claws like Wolverine.

1100
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,155
Yeah.

1101
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,365
And then I could cut open people's faces.

1102
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:18,533
Yeah, but only people

1103
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,660
that had actually broken the law.

1104
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:22,662
Oh, come on, that Jerry thing was a one-time thing.

1105
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:23,997
I mean, I wasn't thinking.

1106
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,457
It was a complete mistake.

1107
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,917
My head just ran away with my mind,

1108
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,419
and I lost control,

1109
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,755
and there I was with that rodeo statue,

1110
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:32,922
and it wasn't my fault.

1111
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,050
Okay. All right.

1112
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,054
Okay.

1113
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,639
I just got so bored behind that dumpster.

1114
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,185
Maybe you just need to be bored sometimes.

1115
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,605
Yeah, but you don't see them getting bored in comic books.

1116
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,232
That's what happens in between the panels.

1117
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:57,197
In between the panels.

1118
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:03,536
Is that where we are right now?

1119
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,501
We could do anything here.

1120
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:12,796
Frank?

1121
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,422
What?

1122
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,927
Do you want to make out?

1123
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:19,928
What?

1124
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,096
With me.

1125
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:24,307
Libby...

1126
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,810
I am married.

1127
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,480
That is a sacred bond.

1128
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:34,526
And you, you are my kid sidekick.

1129
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,195
Yeah...

1130
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:39,656
Yeah, I know.

1131
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,452
I just thought we could celebrate.

1132
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,746
So bake a cake.

1133
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,047
Public opinion has turned of late

1134
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:22,467
in regard to the costumed man known as The Crimson Bolt.

1135
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,386
At least five of

1136
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:26,971
The Crimson Bolt's assault victims

1137
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:30,975
had felony arrest records, ranging from soliciting drugs

1138
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:34,145
to child molestation to homicide.

1139
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:36,481
Was the law enforcement community rash

1140
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,566
in naming The Crimson Bolt a menace?

1141
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:40,652
The guy in the mask

1142
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,070
was definitely defending himself.

1143
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:43,988
Thank God The Crimson Bolt showed up.

1144
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:45,240
God, the man just attacked me.

1145
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:46,741
He was gonna rape me.

1146
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:49,535
We're talking about a severely disturbed individual

1147
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,204
running around the city wearing a mask

1148
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,538
and assaulting people.

1149
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,915
Bad people.

1150
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:56,584
Helping The Crimson Bolt is his new partner,

1151
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,586
a young woman known only as Boltie.

1152
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,507
Police are still offering a reward for the capture...

1153
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:03,675
Oh, my God, it's me! It's me!

1154
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:04,884
Of the two would-be crime fighters.

1155
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,888
I always knew that I would be on TV some day, Frank.

1156
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:10,556
I just had a feeling.

1157
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:14,936
Watch this.

1158
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,233
Where did you learn to make a projectile thingy?

1159
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:24,362
Jesus, what are these things?

1160
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:26,531
I don't know if I'm doing it right,

1161
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:30,660
but if I am... bombs.

1162
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,168
Hey, Frank.

1163
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,172
Frank, are you awake?

1164
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,891
Why are you wearing your costume?

1165
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,727
Can we go fight some crime?

1166
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:56,728
I'm sleeping.

1167
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,021
Please?

1168
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,523
No.

1169
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:04,027
Hey, Frank.

1170
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,321
Do I look good in my costume?

1171
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:09,157
Yeah. I need to sleep, Libby.

1172
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:10,533
Come on.

1173
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,835
What is going on?

1174
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:30,678
What are you...

1175
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:31,804
what is that supposed to be?

1176
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:32,805
That's weird.

1177
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:35,475
Frank.

1178
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:39,145
Look, I know you can't make out with me.

1179
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,606
But can The Crimson Bolt make out with Boltie?

1180
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:42,982
What?

1181
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:46,277
The Crimson Bolt's not married to Sarah; Frank is.

1182
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:47,528
Right?

1183
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:48,863
No, Libby.

1184
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:51,991
Oh, come on.

1185
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:55,203
Stop it, Libby.

1186
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:56,871
Oh, Frank, ever since you've been here,

1187
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:58,373
I can't do it with any other guys.

1188
01:12:58,499 --> 01:12:59,665
No.

1189
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,417
And when was the last time you did anything?

1190
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:02,835
Come on, just this once, Frank. No.

1191
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,504
I know you like how I look in my costume.

1192
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,671
I can tell.

1193
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:08,674
Don't be a fucking liar, Frank.

1194
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:12,178
Oh, my God, Frank.

1195
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,596
Just look, just for a second.

1196
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:14,764
No.

1197
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:18,518
Frank, come on.

1198
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,186
It's all gushy.

1199
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:26,859
Libby, what are you...

1200
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:28,528
You're... - What are you doing?

1201
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:29,612
No, put this on.

1202
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:30,613
Stop it.

1203
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:31,614
Get off of me!

1204
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,992
Put this on for just a second.

1205
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,994
No.

1206
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,038
Just for a second, Frank.

1207
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:41,374
No! - Just for a second.

1208
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,792
No!

1209
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,261
What are you doing?

1210
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:54,262
No.

1211
01:13:57,182 --> 01:13:58,391
Inside!

1212
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,312
Oh, no.

1213
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,315
Oh, oh, yeah.

1214
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,656
Let me see your mask.

1215
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:15,992
I love the way you look in your mask.

1216
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,829
I'm gonna come!

1217
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,035
We need to go get Sarah.

1218
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,369
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1219
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,370
I was sleepwalking.

1220
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,872
I had no idea. And-

1221
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,040
It doesn't matter.

1222
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,041
We need to go.

1223
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,210
You said we weren't ready.

1224
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,211
We'll never be ready.

1225
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,378
That's the whole point.

1226
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,796
Nobody's ever ready for anything.

1227
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,173
You either just do it, or you don't.

1228
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:14,300
And up until now, I've only been not doing it.

1229
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:15,468
But what if they kill you?

1230
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,428
That's their business.

1231
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,649
Who are those guys?

1232
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,319
Maybe we picked the wrong night to do this.

1233
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:35,279
Do you think?

1234
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:42,995
- Mr. Range. So good to see you, sir.

1235
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:45,498
I'd like to place a couple of my men out here.

1236
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,333
Oh, we've got plenty of guys posted out here.

1237
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:50,002
A few more.

1238
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,838
Oh, oh, this vest thing is heavy.

1239
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,843
Let me rest.

1240
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,595
No, come on.

1241
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:04,433
Right this way, sir.

1242
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,270
This is, you know, the living room.

1243
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,604
Hey, can I get you anything at all,

1244
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,439
anything to drink or something to eat, a smoke?

1245
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,067
No, thank you. Show him.

1246
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,697
Oh, yeah, that's money.

1247
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:20,616
And who are these young ladies, Jac-quez?

1248
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:21,951
Oh, well, you know me,

1249
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,120
Mr. Range, always one for facilitating friendships.

1250
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:25,788
I just thought you might like some company

1251
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,624
while your boys did their work.

1252
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,126
And what is your name, sweetheart?

1253
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:33,045
Oh, that's just Sarah. She's, you know...

1254
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:36,716
Sarah. Very pretty girl.

1255
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,384
Maybe you want to go upstairs

1256
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:41,554
and have a little party with Mr. Range.

1257
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,055
No. Sorry.

1258
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:44,557
Excuse me.

1259
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:47,393
Jacques, baby, this guy is really bothering me.

1260
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,061
Oh, no, Sarah, honey, it's okay.

1261
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,230
Mr. Range is a- he's a nice guy.

1262
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:54,233
He just wants to, you know, show you something.

1263
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:55,860
What do you mean?

1264
01:16:55,986 --> 01:17:00,489
It's okay. I have the finest brown.

1265
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,972
I mean, if the guys start thinking

1266
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:26,140
your girlfriend's a whore,

1267
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:30,978
it's time to move on, right?

1268
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:33,230
Yeah, right.

1269
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,160
You're a jerk.

1270
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,538
What the fuck!

1271
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,642
Dude, don't fucking touch me.

1272
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:13,813
No! Get the fuck off!

1273
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,649
No! No!

1274
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,192
No! - Yeah!

1275
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:24,365
Hey, over here.

1276
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:26,659
I'm a little bird.

1277
01:18:40,173 --> 01:18:43,551
No, no!

1278
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:55,146
No!

1279
01:18:56,898 --> 01:19:00,359
No! Please!

1280
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:05,990
No! Please!

1281
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:09,452
You're that dipshit from the news.

1282
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,871
What's in your hand, you fucking retard?

1283
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,625
Boom!

1284
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:17,626
Oh, man!

1285
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:18,669
What the fuck was that?

1286
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:27,845
Frank, the bombs worked!

1287
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:29,346
The bombs, they really worked!

1288
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:34,435
Frank!

1289
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:56,499
Libby?

1290
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:11,263
Did you get him?

1291
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:12,473
Yeah, I got him.

1292
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:30,157
Hey, he's up!

1293
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:05,901
Fuck.

1294
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:07,987
What the fuck?

1295
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:08,988
It's him. He's back.

1296
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:10,489
Who's him? Who's him?

1297
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:11,866
It's Darbo!

1298
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:13,242
What?

1299
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:27,506
We'll get him. Wait! Whoa, whoa!

1300
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,676
Oh, hey, hey, Mr. Range, how you doing, man?

1301
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:31,677
Everything's fine.

1302
01:21:31,803 --> 01:21:32,678
Totally under control.

1303
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:33,971
What is it?

1304
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:35,639
It's just, this joker's running around,

1305
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:37,016
calling himself The Crimson Bolt.

1306
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,726
You called the goddamn Crimson Bolt on me?

1307
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:39,727
No-no-no-no...

1308
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:41,020
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1309
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:42,021
Pack up, Tim. - Yes, sir.

1310
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:43,355
No, no, no, no.

1311
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:45,858
Hey, come on. Come on. It's just this crazy guy.

1312
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:49,361
I mean, it's funny. Right, Abe?

1313
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:50,362
Yeah.

1314
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:04,877
I don't want to die.

1315
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:09,548
No, he's just some guy whose wife I boned.

1316
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:12,051
Come on. You can't do this to me.

1317
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:13,552
I spent a lot of fucking time

1318
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:15,054
setting this up, all right?

1319
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,723
Mr. Range. Mr. Range, sir.

1320
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:20,225
Please, will you listen to me, you fucking asshole?

1321
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:23,270
Move!

1322
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:24,730
Give me this fucking thing. - Whoa!

1323
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:38,994
Nobody can blame me for this. All right?

1324
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,497
I mean, we had a fucking deal.

1325
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,749
I'm just doing what's fair.

1326
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:50,464
He's up there now.

1327
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:53,300
God, dude, this shit is messed up.

1328
01:22:53,426 --> 01:22:54,468
Oh, shut up, man.

1329
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:56,136
If that motherfucker gets in here, Abe,

1330
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:58,305
I swear to God, you're fired.

1331
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:37,738
Sarah!

1332
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:38,906
Here, you want her?

1333
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:40,574
Here, take her.

1334
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:41,909
There you go, fuckhead.

1335
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:45,245
She's yours. You win.

1336
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:46,955
Hey, I didn't do that to her face, by the way.

1337
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,457
That was that fat nigger down there,

1338
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:49,958
but I took care of him, all right.

1339
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,627
Guess that kind of like, what,

1340
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:55,214
makes me, like, your assistant or something now, right?

1341
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:58,008
Anyway, take her.

1342
01:25:02,138 --> 01:25:03,514
Sarah.

1343
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,390
I'm so sorry.

1344
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:08,185
It's okay, pumpkin.

1345
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:17,653
I mean, what are you thinking?

1346
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:19,238
You think you're some kind of fucking hero?

1347
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,575
Hey, who the fuck do you think you're kidding?

1348
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,744
You fucking stupid son of a bitch.

1349
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,579
This is not about good and evil.

1350
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:30,916
This is about, I had her, and you didn't.

1351
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:33,252
This is about, she loved me more

1352
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:38,632
because I am fucking interesting.

1353
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:41,927
Shut up, crime.

1354
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,275
What are you gonna do?

1355
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,777
You gonna execute me for my sins?

1356
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:00,279
Don't think you're better than me,

1357
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:02,614
you fucking psycho.

1358
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:06,702
You fucking almost kill people for butting into line.

1359
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,537
You don't butt in line!

1360
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,540
You don't sell drugs!

1361
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,251
You don't molest little children!

1362
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:17,421
You don't profit on the misery of others!

1363
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:20,090
The rules were set a long time ago.

1364
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:22,843
They don't change!

1365
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:24,136
All right, just take her, then!

1366
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:25,179
Take her!

1367
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:27,014
You really think that killing me,

1368
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:31,351
stabbing me to death, is gonna change the world?

1369
01:26:31,477 --> 01:26:37,024
I can't know that for sure...

1370
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,609
unless I try.

1371
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:39,610
No.

1372
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:40,611
No!

1373
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:44,740
No, Frank!

1374
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:49,578
Frank!

1375
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:49,596
So maybe you think something's wrong with me.

1376
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:53,308
Maybe you thought I was gonna learn

1377
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:56,311
what Jacques said was true,

1378
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:58,522
that I was deluded...

1379
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:06,405
That I was as evil as the rest of them.

1380
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:10,075
But maybe you're the one who needs to learn something.

1381
01:28:10,201 --> 01:28:13,578
I know how it looks.

1382
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:17,416
But sometimes how it looks and how it is

1383
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:19,543
are two different things.

1384
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,754
The truth was in my heart.

1385
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,091
I followed it...

1386
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:27,759
You okay?

1387
01:28:27,885 --> 01:28:30,762
And I saved Sarah.

1388
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:34,266
She stayed with me a couple months.

1389
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,560
They were not bad times.

1390
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,022
Though, they were most likely

1391
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,399
out of Sarah's sense of obligation.

1392
01:28:47,071 --> 01:28:49,448
But one morning,

1393
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:52,159
she moved on.

1394
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:55,787
I thought it was me at the time,

1395
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:58,457
that I was the chosen one,

1396
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,209
but it was Sarah all along.

1397
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,879
And that's why I needed to save her.

1398
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:08,550
She needed to finish school, to study anthropology,

1399
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:10,635
because Sarah knows something about people.

1400
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,971
We're not able to even feel the love that...

1401
01:29:13,097 --> 01:29:15,140
She needed to go back to her meetings,

1402
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:17,809
where she had insights that struck others uniquely.

1403
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:19,811
"FINE" means, "Fucked up, Insecure,

1404
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:22,647
Neurotic, and Emotional."

1405
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,649
And sometimes she needed to have nightmares

1406
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:28,320
of those ugly times at Jacques' ranch.

1407
01:29:31,824 --> 01:29:35,202
Because a kind man, a man who was good

1408
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:37,204
and didn't know it,

1409
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:42,209
needed to learn how to comfort someone.

1410
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:45,504
And maybe most of all, Sarah needed to have

1411
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:50,342
Patrick and Trevor and Laura and Joy,

1412
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:53,512
four children who probably wouldn't be at all

1413
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,681
if Libby and I hadn't gone to Jacques' ranch that night.

1414
01:29:56,808 --> 01:30:02,396
Maybe, if all of us are lucky,

1415
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:05,732
they're the ones who are gonna change the world.

1416
01:30:05,858 --> 01:30:08,527
And me?

1417
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:12,197
Well, I got that rabbit after all.

1418
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:15,826
That, and something much more.

1419
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:58,543
Sweet Jesus.

1420
01:35:58,669 --> 01:36:01,171
Bathe my hand in the power of God.
