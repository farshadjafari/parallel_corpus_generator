<i>Oh God,</i>

3
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:51,653
<i>God grant me the serenity
to accept the things...</i>

4
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:52,732
<i>I cannot change...</i>

5
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:55,252
- Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?

6
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:57,653
<i>...courage to change the
things that I can...</i>

7
00:00:57,812 --> 00:00:58,533
- Come on!

8
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:00,973
- You have been a good boy for a long time.

9
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:03,252
- You know you want to do this.

10
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:04,252
<i>...and wisdom...</i>

11
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:07,933
<i>...wisdom to know the difference...</i>

12
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:18,613
<i>Taking, as He did, this sinful world</i>

13
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:20,698
<i>as it is, not as I would have it.</i>

14
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:23,732
<i>Trusting that He will make all things
right, If I surrender to His will,</i>

15
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,772
<i>that I may be reasonably
happy in this life</i>

17
00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:30,453
<i>Amen.</i>

18
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:32,658
I could go on and on

19
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,333
about what a great guy here Earl is,

20
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,413
how he gives so freely
of his time and his money.

21
00:01:38,252 --> 00:01:42,573
Even how he... believes in
how he cuts his toenails.

22
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:48,573
Let's get Earl up here and speak for himself.

23
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:49,897
Ladies and gentlemen,

24
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:54,653
I give you a businessman,
philanthropist, a very dear friend,

25
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:56,453
and the Portland Chamber of Commerce

26
00:01:56,488 --> 00:01:57,453
Man of the Year,

27
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,252
Mr. Earl Brooks!

28
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,093
Thank you all

29
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:07,950
very much.

30
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:14,573
First thing I'd like
to say is that I--

31
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:18,853
I don't even know how I cut my toenails.

32
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:24,412
20 years ago,

33
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:26,612
when I started the Brook's box factories,

34
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,173
I never dreamed I would--

35
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,653
I never dreamed that I would one
day be standing here...

37
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:52,653
Did you see
Sis Wallace's dress?

38
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:55,453
You could see her nipples,

39
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:56,333
at her age!

40
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:59,133
Wow, she cannot keep those things hidden.

41
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:03,251
The only thing that would have
made this evening more perfect...

42
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:04,853
is if Jane had been here.

43
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,133
Emma, she called to
congratulate me, right?

44
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:11,772
She has midterms coming up.

45
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:14,653
I think she's dropping out.

46
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:16,573
Let's see.

47
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:20,853
Nothing she does is
wrong with you, is it?

48
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,133
Well,

49
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:25,853
she missed a good party.

50
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,653
It's not like it's not set up.

51
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:40,732
You already know how to
bypass the alarms,

52
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,732
you know I don't pick the locks...

53
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:43,653
- No.

54
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:47,251
You are the fucking Man of the Year,

55
00:03:47,772 --> 00:03:48,972
you deserve a treat.

56
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:50,653
- No, Marshall, I said no.

57
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:52,213
But I heard you.

58
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:55,372
But you don't mean 'no'.

59
00:03:58,732 --> 00:03:59,853
What's wrong?

60
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:03,052
Nothing.

61
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:06,952
You are frowning.

62
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:09,932
I'm thinking about what
I didn't say in the speech.

63
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:10,653

64
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:12,532
Honey,

65
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,932
It was so... moving.

66
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:17,852
You made us all laugh.

67
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:21,372
I don't think anybody felt left out.

68
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:27,652
They have their dance class tonight.

69
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,453
You can just drive by

70
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,612
and look at them.

71
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:35,932
There's no harm
in just having a look.

72
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:38,251
No means no, Marshall.

73
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:39,852
- Please...

74
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:41,453
Pretty please...

75
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:56,652
I thought the food tonight was very good
but I was not crazy about the dessert.

76
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:01,573
Would you like to stop somewhere
and get something sweet?

77
00:05:02,731 --> 00:05:03,772
Ok.

78
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:10,412
You know that I don't want a small dog.

79
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,972
Labradors are supposed to be brave.

80
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:17,251
Golties, always had Golden Retrievers,
they're very happy...

81
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:22,452
An Irish Labrador is in the middle now.

82
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:26,052
It's a little smaller in build.
That still is quite full.

83
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,152
Standard poodles, you call it a very happy fam.

84
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:33,152
How 'bout a rescue dog, what do you think?

85
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,453
Don't let me do this,
don't let me do this, please.

86
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:57,372
I don't want to start again.

87
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:00,812
You promised her, you promised.

88
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:02,812
Please... please.

89
00:06:02,972 --> 00:06:05,932
- Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?

90
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:26,972
I'm going to stay up a while,

91
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:31,052
maybe go to the studio
and play with some glaciers.

92
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:33,852
Okay.

93
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:39,251
I'm gonna read, and if I'm not
awake, wake me when you come back.

94
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:49,532
On the way,

95
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,972
I though you were
wonderful tonight, Mrs Brooks.

96
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:55,772
Thank you, Mr. Brooks.

97
00:08:07,532 --> 00:08:09,532
Oh, Lordie, road man.
Well I have missed this...

98
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:11,932
'cause we are going to have so much fun--

99
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:16,333
This is the last time, Marshall,
understand me? It's the very last time!

100
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:17,952
Don't you dare quit on me,
you piece of shit.

101
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:20,771
I wanna see what they are doing.

102
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:13,652
Hello.

103
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:16,332
Fuck!

104
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:17,892
Be quiet!

105
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:19,133
Sit up!

106
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:56,652
Oh, Earl.

107
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:06,452
What the fuck is this?

108
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:12,612
These fucking pigs like to
do it with the curtains open.

109
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:16,251
You should have known that. This
is a big mistake for you, Earl.

110
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:21,652
Almost like a want to
get caught on, Marshall.

111
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:23,771
Oh, don't fucking do that.

112
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:30,852
I don't think either of us will enjoy spending the
rest of our lives on death row or a lethal injection.

113
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:34,972
Yes, Sir.

114
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,932
Please forgive me.

115
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:39,133
Please forgive me.

116
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:44,671
You're a fucking artist
Earl, I give you that.

117
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:55,652
Don't even think about it.

118
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:57,452
You know the rules.

119
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:24,171
Now go upstairs and make love
to your beautiful wife.

120
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:42,852
Do we have the room, please?

121
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:46,452
Thank you.

122
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,932
There's a thumbprint, right there.

123
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,332
One his, one hers?

124
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:55,532
That's what it looks like.

125
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:58,171
This guy has not been
active for over 2 years.

126
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:03,652
He always rearranges the bodies,
but this is way out of character.

127
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,332
Usually it's much more romantic.

128
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:09,652
Arms around each other, kissing...

129
00:14:10,052 --> 00:14:12,452
mouths open, tongues touching.

130
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:15,052
Bullets from straight through the victims,

131
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:16,251
killer recovered the slugs.

132
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:25,652
Were these open or
closed when you got here?

133
00:14:25,687 --> 00:14:26,572
Closed.

134
00:14:32,052 --> 00:14:33,932
Could be the work of a copycat.

135
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:38,652
It has never been revealed to the
public that the killer retrieves the slugs.

136
00:14:39,652 --> 00:14:41,532
Jesus, I was hoping
this guy was either dead

137
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:43,452
or in jail on some other charge.

138
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:50,652
We checked the whole neighbourhood,
so far nobody saw a thing.

139
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:57,852
Leaving them like this... he must have
been really angry at them for some reason.

140
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,731
Where would they keep their vacuum cleaner?

141
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:15,452
So I bet you 100 bucks, Hawkins,
there is no bag in this vacuum cleaner.

142
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:17,413
I have no idea what
the hell you are looking for.

143
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:21,933
He vacuumed the house
and took the bag.

144
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:26,572
What if he kills somebody that
didn't have a vacuum cleaner?

145
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:28,332
He wouldn't do that.

146
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,173
Our best hope is if someone
in there saw something.

147
00:15:36,731 --> 00:15:37,933
Detective Tracy Atwood?

148
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:39,772
- Yes?
- Hi. This is for you.

149
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,452
You've been served.

150
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,133
You fucking asshole.

151
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,812
I am in the middle of a fucking murdering investigation.

152
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:45,751
- Listen lady, I'm just a messenger here...
- Hawkins!

153
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:46,653
What's the deal?

154
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:47,772
Get this ass out of here!

155
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:51,053
What is it?

156
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,217
Soon to be ex-husband's
scumbag lawyer, trying to show me

157
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:59,133
just how painful she can make my life
if I don't give them what they want.

158
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:00,972
Are there any new members?

159
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:03,072
Okay.

160
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:07,652
Hello, my name is Vaughn,

161
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:12,053
I'm an alcoholic, and I haven't
had a drink in 10 months.

162
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:22,731
Hi, my name is Earl, and...

163
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:24,332
I'm an addict.

164
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:32,251
Anyone else?

165
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,118
You are such a fucking hypocrite.

166
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:38,972
If you were honest, you'd step up there and say:
'Hi, I'm Earl, I killed two people last night',

167
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:43,653
I'd really got off on it but
I need your help to be cured.

168
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:47,133
I'm different, Marshall.
I won't argue that with you.

169
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:52,251
This it is the only place that has ever
helped me be normal, and I've been straight

170
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:55,251
up until last night...
for the past 2 years.

171
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:58,053
I am not going to kill again.

172
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:03,852
And I am not going to quit
coming here because it upsets you.

173
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:07,772
...we need a cleanup crew
for afterwards.

174
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,013
We need some volunteers for the...

175
00:17:10,052 --> 00:17:12,653
Oh, thank you, Earl. I appreciate that.

176
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:26,852
Based on your requirements,
this is our first attempt.

177
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:29,932
<i>Mr. Brooks, your daughter is
waiting for you in your office.</i>

178
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,893
Well, I hope this is what
you had in mind, if not...

179
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:38,732
we would love to work with
you further on the design.

180
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,533
Always find a challenge on machines.

181
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:46,251
Now, if you gentlemen would excuse me,
I need to see how much kin deployment cost me.

182
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,336
I understand.

183
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:51,852
Daughter cost money. Me too.

184
00:17:54,052 --> 00:17:56,052
I believe you do understand.

185
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,852
Matt Johnson wants to schedule
lunch for Friday, can I talk to--

186
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:01,452
- Sunday? Did--?
- Can you hold this for a second?

187
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:06,812
Did Jane call and say she was coming?

188
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,653
Nobody gave me
that message, Mr. Brooks.

189
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:11,852
- She is in there?
- Yeah, she is, and...

190
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:18,251
She has some boxes and suitcases downstairs
and she didn't have any money for the cab.

191
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:20,052
And you paid for that?

192
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,653
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

193
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:23,171
Hold my calls.

194
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:24,133
Sure.

195
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,372
I told you.

196
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:27,772
When it's appropriate.

197
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:29,533
You let me know.

198
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:32,732
And can I have some water?

199
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:35,372
Hello gorgeous.

200
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:39,952
What are you doing here?

201
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:41,152
I'm sorry Daddy.

202
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:44,972
Please don't be angry with me.

203
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:47,497
All right, I can guess what you've done,

204
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:50,533
but why don't you tell me
and then I'll decide.

205
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:52,452
I dropped out of school.

206
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:55,952
Ouch.

207
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:57,872
Oh Jane...
Okay.

208
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:00,052
Have you told your mother?

209
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:01,732
No, I wanted to talk to you first.

210
00:19:01,772 --> 00:19:03,852
Well, you gonna have to
tell her, Jane, all right?

211
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,372
I'm not going to do that for you.

212
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:07,872
- Why can't you--?
- Sit!

213
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:09,052
And then,

214
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:11,452
together, the three of us, will decide

215
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,211
where it'll go from here.

216
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:16,972
Okay, but I thought a lot about this.
College is a waste of time for me.

217
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:19,772
How does...?

218
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:23,211
How does somebody know that,
half way through their freshmen year?

219
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:26,251
You didn't even go to college,
Daddy, and you are successful.

220
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,653
I want to come work for you.

221
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:33,653
She is not telling you
everything, she is hiding something.

222
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:35,251
I know.

223
00:19:39,372 --> 00:19:41,332
I am not hiring right now, sweetheart.

224
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:43,452
Okay, but just listen to me for one second.

225
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,133
All right?
Look.

226
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:50,172
What would happen to the business if, God
forbid, something would happen to you?

227
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:51,732
Okay?

228
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:54,533
Mom would probably have
to sell to strangers.

229
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:57,352
Now look, I am willing to start at the bottom,

230
00:19:57,388 --> 00:19:59,497
you can treat me like a regular employee.

231
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:03,653
I just want to learn everything there is
to know about running the box business.

232
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:05,932
Then, when the time comes...

233
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:08,732
It can stay in the family.

234
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:13,932
Well, that's sweet, honey, but...

235
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,772
you are not talking about business, you
are talking about emotion. Now get up.

236
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:22,332
In fact, your mother and I came
this close to selling out last year.

237
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,133
What?

238
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:25,092
That's right, and had we
been offered a little more money,

239
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:27,772
and they still may come back to us,

240
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:28,932
we would sell.

241
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:31,533
What would you do without the business?

242
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:34,452
Yes?

243
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,932
I'm sorry. The man outside insisted
that I give this to you.

244
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,751
He claims that you'll find what's
inside very interesting.

245
00:20:43,852 --> 00:20:45,772
What is he, Sunday? Is he a salesman?

246
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:47,612
I've never seen him before.

247
00:20:47,653 --> 00:20:49,052
I'll just give him back to him
and I'll tell him to call--

248
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:50,732
No, Sunday. Sunday, come here...

249
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:52,972
Thank you.

250
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:59,472
Jane, part of spending
four years at college is...

251
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:03,771
to give yourself a chance to
find out...

252
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:11,533
who you are...

253
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:14,052
and what you want to do.

254
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:17,497
I'll talk to Mom,

255
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:19,452
but I am not going back to school.

256
00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:23,932
And where would you live?

257
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,133
To save money, I would move back home,

258
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:30,171
but no rules, no curfew. I want to
be treated as an adult.

259
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,653
Would you pay for rent?

260
00:21:35,932 --> 00:21:37,251
Would you pay for food?

261
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,653
No Dad, you are a very wealthy man.
I think you can afford to keep me.

262
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:46,052
Sunday, would you show the
gentleman who gave you the envelope...

263
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:49,171
into the conference room and
tell him that I would meet him there?

264
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:50,332
No problem, Mr. Brooks.

265
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:51,251
And, uh...

266
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:55,533
What happened to the BMW, Jane?

267
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:59,932
A friend is going to drive it up.
It will be here next weekend.

268
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,653
...and get Jane a cab.

269
00:22:07,052 --> 00:22:09,336
Call your mother.

270
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:10,732
Are you going to give me a job?

271
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:15,452
If this were up to me, and I think your
mother will agree with this, I...

272
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:18,653
I think you should go back to school.

273
00:22:19,932 --> 00:22:20,972
You see that, Marshall?

274
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:23,772
That's why I didn't want to
do the dance couple!

275
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:26,852
Stop your fucking whining, Earl.

276
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:32,092
You enjoyed doing that couple just as
as much I did and look at the bright side:

277
00:22:32,332 --> 00:22:34,937
He came to us, he didn't go to the cops.

278
00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:37,732
If he's trying to shake us
down, we kill him, period.

279
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:40,171
We make it fun, but we'll kill him.

280
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:42,171
End of story.

281
00:22:55,452 --> 00:22:57,251
What can I do for you, Mister...?

282
00:22:57,852 --> 00:23:00,251
Let's say... Smith.

283
00:23:01,372 --> 00:23:02,732
Okay, Mr. Smith.

284
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,133
Before you get the wrong impression, Mr. Brooks.
I'm not here to shake you down.

285
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:13,452
Well, then these are the only copies of
these photos and you have no others.

286
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,412
No.
I have other copies and other photos

287
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:18,373
and if anything happens to me...

288
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:20,251
How did you find me, Mr. Smith?

289
00:23:21,372 --> 00:23:23,852
You are the Man of the Year, Mr. Brooks.

290
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,852
Your picture is in the paper.

291
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:33,653
And if it had not have been... I don't know.
I don't know what I would have done.

292
00:23:35,052 --> 00:23:35,852
Lucky me.

293
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:38,572
What is it that I can help you with?

294
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:41,251
I've been watching
that couple for months.

295
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:44,852
Yeah, they liked to make
love with the blinds opened.

296
00:23:46,052 --> 00:23:49,533
Sometimes I would... take pictures,

297
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:51,533
visual aids, for later.

298
00:23:54,452 --> 00:23:56,452
It's a great way to get
off, I tell you that.

299
00:23:56,572 --> 00:23:58,332
It was fun, I thought,

300
00:23:58,772 --> 00:23:59,932
until I saw you've killed them.

301
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:02,533
And I have never

302
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:05,852
ever felt that... rush,

303
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:07,052
like that, ever!

304
00:24:11,932 --> 00:24:13,372
I know you are the thumbprint killer.

305
00:24:14,572 --> 00:24:16,052
You have done this before.

306
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:19,251
What I want...

307
00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:25,452
is for you to take me with
you next time you kill someone,

308
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,772
and I'd like that to be soon.

309
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:39,772
And you were worried this
was going to be unpleasant?

310
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:41,332
The answer is simple:

311
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:45,452
Just tell Mr. Smith that you
have decided never to kill again

312
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:47,052
and he'll go away.

313
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,452
You enjoy watching me suffer, don't you?

314
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:51,251
In a word, yes.

315
00:24:52,572 --> 00:24:54,972
Where do you think he
has the other pictures?

316
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:59,251
He put them in a safety deposit box,

317
00:25:00,251 --> 00:25:03,533
but I bet the box is at the bank
where he keeps his checking account,

318
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:06,171
and the key...

319
00:25:08,732 --> 00:25:11,052
It's on his key chain.

320
00:25:12,572 --> 00:25:14,972
He really wants us to do this.

321
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:17,932
He is not going to the cops.

322
00:25:24,332 --> 00:25:25,772
We have a deal?

323
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,937
From the angle of these pictures...

324
00:25:30,972 --> 00:25:35,533
you live on the 3rd floor of the apartment building
across the alley from the couple's house.

325
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,018
Well...

326
00:25:38,052 --> 00:25:39,932
Yes or no, Mr. Smith?

327
00:25:41,052 --> 00:25:41,772
Yes.

328
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:44,732
What time do you get home from work?

329
00:25:44,772 --> 00:25:45,612
6.30,

330
00:25:45,653 --> 00:25:47,052
7, depending of the traffic.

331
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:51,497
you can never come here again.

332
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,932
You can never call me.
Do you understand that?

333
00:25:54,572 --> 00:25:56,751
- Yes.
- Okay.

334
00:25:58,852 --> 00:25:59,932
Tomorrow night.

335
00:26:00,972 --> 00:26:02,932
Not tonight, tomorrow night at 8 o'clock,

336
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:06,251
leave your apartment
building and walk east.

337
00:26:06,572 --> 00:26:08,171
I will pick you up there.

338
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:15,251
If you are thinking
about doing anything...

339
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,533
We're both aware of the rules, Mr. Smith.

340
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:22,452
But I feel I must warn you:

341
00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:25,852
If it turns out that you enjoy killing,

342
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,852
it can become very addictive.

343
00:26:29,932 --> 00:26:31,452
It could ruin your life.

344
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,271
- I want to do this.
- Okay.

345
00:26:40,972 --> 00:26:42,413
Have I covered everything?

346
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,732
I can't think of anything else.

347
00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:48,171
Then I'll see you
tomorrow night, Mr. Smith.

348
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:04,572
We've talked to our client and we've come up with a figure
that we feel is more than fair.

349
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:10,092
We can have a check for that
amount in your office by 6 o'clock.

350
00:27:10,332 --> 00:27:12,251
We told you at the
beginning what we wanted.

351
00:27:12,492 --> 00:27:13,653
That hasn't changed.

352
00:27:14,452 --> 00:27:16,972
We feel our offer is more than generous.

353
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:19,732
I paid for everything
while we were together,

354
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:23,653
and now I'm being asked
to give this guy a bonus?

355
00:27:24,332 --> 00:27:28,452
For spending time with me, time that
I've already paid for in the first place?

356
00:27:28,692 --> 00:27:32,251
You know as well as I do, counselor,
you're not going to get a million five.

357
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:35,772
Oh, I don't
know that, no, I...

358
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:39,052
Well, in fact, this is the
front page of yesterday's paper.

359
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:42,332
'Hangman escapes'

360
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:44,533
'After torturing his victims,

361
00:27:44,572 --> 00:27:45,452
'Thorton Meeks

362
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,013
'would hang them in public places,

363
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:51,251
'church steeples, balconies,
freeways overpasses--'

364
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:52,251
Where this is going?

365
00:27:52,653 --> 00:27:55,852
Well, your client captured Mr. Meeks.

366
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:58,653
Come on Tracy, this is
not a lot of money for you,

367
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:04,171
and we both know how frightened I was after Meeks
said that he was going to escape and come back and kill you.

368
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:05,452
Let me ask again:

369
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:07,413
What is your point?

370
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:11,336
Our point is that Meeks,
or someone like Meeks,

371
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:14,812
may come after my client
in order to hurt your client.

372
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:17,612
That is very imaginative, counsellor,

373
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:19,612
but it's not based in reality at all.

374
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:21,492
Jesse.

375
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,372
Let's just let us handle this, please.

376
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:24,533
- Tracy?
- Jesse,

377
00:28:24,572 --> 00:28:27,852
you know what would make me
feel really safe right now?

378
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:33,251
If you got hit by a truck...

379
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:34,452
and died.

380
00:28:36,572 --> 00:28:37,932
Well, that's it.

381
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:39,812
Mr. Vialo and I are leaving.

382
00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:42,456
You threatened the safety of my client.

383
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:44,732
We are going to have to get a restraint order.

384
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:46,251
See you in court.

385
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:50,452
Get hit by a truck and die?

386
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:54,251
Fuck it, I felt good.

387
00:28:54,852 --> 00:28:57,452
It's not what's here, it's what's not
here that's interesting.

388
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:00,612
If I had a number, I'd say
these people have been killed by a ghost

389
00:29:00,653 --> 00:29:05,452
The autopsy said there was a tiny
piece of plastic in the female victim's brain.

390
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:10,013
It's a dead end, he bags the gun. He puts a one
gallon plastic freezer bag over his hand to his wrists.

391
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:14,572
Little bit of plastic comes out with the first slug
when the shell's gone in the bag.

392
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:15,812
Were you looking for me?

393
00:29:15,852 --> 00:29:18,932
I've received the subpena from
your husband for your work records,

394
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:22,332
where you worked, date and
times for the past two years.

395
00:29:22,972 --> 00:29:27,133
He's just trying to blackmail me, until a settlement,
but my lawyers assure me that I'll go never to court.

396
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:28,653
I can't take that chance.

397
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:31,533
almost three quarters of
your cases are current,

398
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:35,251
so, until you're settling your divorce,
I'm gonna have to put you on a desk.

399
00:29:35,772 --> 00:29:37,372
That's also blackmail.

400
00:29:38,332 --> 00:29:40,533
Do you have any idea what
this guy has done to me?

401
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,452
While we were married, while
I was paying for everything,

402
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:46,413
he was just out fucking every
woman he can get his hands on.

403
00:29:46,572 --> 00:29:49,133
He fucked my friends,
he fucked my cousins.

404
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:50,332
He made me look like an idiot.

405
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,653
- And?
- And what?

406
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,533
Get over it!

407
00:29:54,653 --> 00:29:58,732
You can't grow old as a woman without
having at least one frowzy man in your life.

408
00:29:58,772 --> 00:30:01,852
Well, I made him an offer and I
am not going to give him a dime more.

409
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:03,452
Did you hear that Meeks escaped?

410
00:30:03,852 --> 00:30:04,533
Yeah.

411
00:30:04,653 --> 00:30:07,772
We got every unit looking for him,
you want me to put a detail on you?

412
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:09,932
I think I can take care of myself.

413
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:14,852
It's one of your biggest problems, Tracy.
You don't know how to ask for help.

414
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:04,052
What the fuck, what the fuck, what...?

415
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:10,251
Don't worry, if I were here to
kill you, you would already be dead.

416
00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:17,413
After you left today, I realized that our
friendship was a little one-sided.

417
00:31:18,452 --> 00:31:21,653
So, tomorrow night when we meet,
would you be so kind as to bring

418
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:24,852
all the pictures and the
memory card from your camera?

419
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:29,251
That way we can like each
other simply for who we are.

420
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:31,452
If you don't show up...

421
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:36,972
I will presume that you have gone
to the police and I will kill you.

422
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:42,452
Even if I'll go to jail because of you, Mr
Smith, someone will find you, wherever you are...

423
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:44,452
and they will kill you.

424
00:31:52,852 --> 00:31:54,052
Mr. Brooks.

425
00:31:57,772 --> 00:32:00,653
Mr. Brooks?

426
00:32:13,053 --> 00:32:14,171
Mr. Brooks?

427
00:32:32,853 --> 00:32:33,853
Wow!

428
00:33:18,573 --> 00:33:20,053
It's nice to have you home.

429
00:33:30,353 --> 00:33:31,968
- Why do I have to know what's expected?

430
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:34,453
- Why do I have to miss you? And isn't my happiness worth anything--?

431
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:38,353
Hello, hello. You have to explain this to me?
It's because you're a mother, that's why!

432
00:33:45,653 --> 00:33:46,573
What's wrong, girls?

433
00:33:54,853 --> 00:33:57,251
Ask your daughter what the
real reason is she dropped out of school.

434
00:33:57,692 --> 00:33:59,533
I told you, it's not the real reason.

435
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:00,812
Honey...

436
00:34:00,853 --> 00:34:02,171
you wanted to go to college.

437
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:04,853
You had good grades, your father put
in favours to get you into that school.

438
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:06,133
If this is not the reason...

439
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:07,812
please, Dear God, tell me the reason.

440
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:10,573
Why does your mother think
you dropped out of the school?

441
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:14,853
I'm pregnant.

442
00:34:15,132 --> 00:34:17,212
But that's not the reason I dropped out.

443
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:19,732
Being pregnant wouldn't keep me
from going to school if I wanted to.

444
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:26,732
Who is the father?

445
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:29,533
Some guy a was seeing.

446
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:31,853
Some...some guy, does he know?

447
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:33,212
Of course he knows, Dad.

448
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:36,053
He is married, he got two kids,
he wants nothing to do with me.

449
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:36,933
Oh, honey.

450
00:34:38,853 --> 00:34:39,933
Oh, honey--

451
00:34:39,973 --> 00:34:41,413
I'm not going to go through with it,

452
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:42,538
so there is nothing to be upset about.

453
00:34:42,573 --> 00:34:44,172
I mean, I wasn't even
going to tell you guys--

454
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:44,732
There will be

455
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:46,653
no abortion, Jane.

456
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:49,813
No, Dad, you're not going to
tell me what to do, ok?

457
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:51,732
It's my body and I'll
do what I want with it.

458
00:34:58,053 --> 00:34:59,533
I'm sorry, you're right. I said it wrong.

459
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:03,853
I wasn't trying to tell
you what to do. What I was...

460
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:08,853
What I was trying to say is that...

461
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,373
a grandchild would be a wonderful gift

462
00:35:11,853 --> 00:35:12,973
for your mother and me.

463
00:35:16,172 --> 00:35:19,533
Would you really want to have a
grandchild? Even if I'm not married?

464
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,053
Yes.

465
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,617
A child is what's important.

466
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:30,251
We would... we would love it and
cheerish it completely and we would...

467
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:33,251
We would help you raise it.

468
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:38,453
If it means that much to
you, I will think about it.

469
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:50,453
I'm gonna have to start getting
up little earlier, uh, honey?

470
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:58,251
Well, we were right.

471
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:00,698
She was hiding something.

472
00:36:00,732 --> 00:36:03,853
The pregnancy is not of all of it,
she's hiding something bigger.

473
00:36:08,853 --> 00:36:10,053
Something much bigger.

474
00:36:10,973 --> 00:36:11,533
You think so?

475
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:13,132
I know so,

476
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,132
and so do you.

477
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,732
It's darker tonight
than it was on your night.

478
00:37:18,973 --> 00:37:20,053
But still...

479
00:37:20,453 --> 00:37:23,732
How did you managed to not
bump into the furniture?

480
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:39,212
Was the light on...

481
00:37:39,251 --> 00:37:40,853
or did you turn it on?

482
00:37:40,973 --> 00:37:43,853
Because I know you, and you
wouldn't risk a shot in the dark.

483
00:37:55,053 --> 00:37:56,297
Where have you been?

484
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:59,533
Did you miss the thrill of killing?

485
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:10,453
What if these are stuck closed,

486
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:13,251
because you yanked them closed?

487
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,653
Which would mean...

488
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:21,212
they were open...

489
00:38:21,251 --> 00:38:23,251
when you came into the room.

490
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,251
Thank you, I appreciate your time.

491
00:38:34,453 --> 00:38:35,973
Oops, sorry. I'm sorry.

492
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:37,053
No, I'm sorry.

493
00:38:38,172 --> 00:38:39,013
I was just about to knock.

494
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:41,053
I'm detective Atwood, Portland police.

495
00:38:41,092 --> 00:38:42,333
How are you doing this evening?

496
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:43,373
Fine.

497
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:47,132
You are a photographer,
Mr... Bafford?

498
00:38:47,172 --> 00:38:48,453
- No.
- No?

499
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:49,973
Thank you.

500
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:53,732
No, actually it's
a hobby I just started.

501
00:38:54,653 --> 00:38:56,653
I don't know if you're aware, but there was a murder.

502
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,712
Yes, in the house, across the way.

503
00:38:59,053 --> 00:39:03,053
You didn't happen to see anything
unusual or suspicious that night, did you?

504
00:39:04,853 --> 00:39:07,973
No, I wondered that
when it happened, but...

505
00:39:08,251 --> 00:39:09,053
No.

506
00:39:09,653 --> 00:39:12,333
I'm sorry, I'm supposed
to be meeting somebody

507
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:13,533
and I don't want to be late.

508
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,933
Well, here is my card.

509
00:39:16,973 --> 00:39:19,732
If you did hear something
or remember anything...?

510
00:39:20,732 --> 00:39:24,573
I wish I could be
more help, but...Sorry.

511
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:40,453
He looks clean.

512
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:43,732
Looks like he's alone.

513
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:47,853
No, I tell you,
he really wants to do that.

514
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:52,653
Maybe I should plow over there.
Pick him up.

515
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:54,973
No, just honk.

516
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:59,453
Maybe he'll get killed crossing the street
and save us the mess of doing it.

517
00:40:18,653 --> 00:40:19,653
Almost...

518
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:33,132
It's coming down hard.

519
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:35,973
They say it will be sunny tomorrow.

520
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:36,813
I never trust those guys.

521
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:38,453
They say it's going to be clear, and it rains.

522
00:40:38,573 --> 00:40:41,533
And they say it's going to rain
and it's... sunny.

523
00:40:43,251 --> 00:40:46,172
I believe this is what you asked for.

524
00:40:48,172 --> 00:40:50,453
The pictures and the memory card,

525
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:51,251
all here?

526
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:53,373
Both.

527
00:40:55,732 --> 00:40:59,533
You and I both know that not
all the pictures are in here,

528
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,053
and you made a copy of the
memory card, as a security option.

529
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:06,653
But you understand my position?

530
00:41:08,653 --> 00:41:10,053
Yes, I do.

531
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:13,005
But it's my hope that once you get to know me better

532
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:15,251
you feel confortable in giving me everything...

533
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:17,053
that I've asked you for.

534
00:41:19,373 --> 00:41:20,251
Sounds correct.

535
00:41:22,732 --> 00:41:23,973
I thought you might be interested in this.

536
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:28,172
this is the police woman,
who is looking for you

537
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:32,653
Wow, we've never known anyone
that was looking for us before.

538
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:36,453
You're going to have to find out everything
there is to know about this...

539
00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:37,732
woman.

540
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:41,453
This is close, Marshall.

541
00:41:42,453 --> 00:41:44,251
This is too damn close.

542
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:48,333
So...

543
00:41:48,732 --> 00:41:49,853
what's the plan?

544
00:41:50,732 --> 00:41:54,053
What do we...
What are we doing here tonight?

545
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:58,053
We'll drive around until we
see someone we think we might...

546
00:41:58,693 --> 00:41:59,653
enjoy killing.

547
00:42:02,732 --> 00:42:03,453
Really?

548
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:05,973
You don't have have somebody in mind?

549
00:42:06,453 --> 00:42:08,732
I don't enjoy this Mr. Smith.
I do it...

550
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:10,573
because I am addicted to it.

551
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:14,853
Before you entered my life I vowed
that I would never kill again,

552
00:42:14,893 --> 00:42:18,053
so, this is... your party.

553
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:22,732
You can choose anyone you
want and we will do it together.

554
00:42:28,653 --> 00:42:30,333
Can I pick somebody that I know?

555
00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:37,732
No.

556
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,853
You never kill someone you know.

557
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:44,172
It's the easiest way to get caught.

558
00:42:45,973 --> 00:42:47,053
- Okay?
- Yeah.

559
00:42:50,453 --> 00:42:51,453
Buckle up.

560
00:42:54,653 --> 00:42:55,973
You look a little bit like that...

561
00:42:56,732 --> 00:42:57,613
E.T. guy.

562
00:42:57,653 --> 00:42:59,853
Remember that movie?
When he flies on the bike?

563
00:42:59,893 --> 00:43:00,853
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

564
00:43:00,973 --> 00:43:02,212
I liked that movie.

565
00:44:01,533 --> 00:44:03,053
Jesus Christ!

566
00:44:07,373 --> 00:44:08,698
Fuck him.

567
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:10,732
It's his fault, he is an asshole.

568
00:44:11,853 --> 00:44:12,653
Fuck you.

569
00:44:15,773 --> 00:44:17,533
Maybe Mr Smith would like to kill

570
00:44:17,573 --> 00:44:19,132
the driver of the pickup?

571
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:24,973
What about the driver of the pickup?

572
00:44:28,172 --> 00:44:29,853
What if we kill him?

573
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:32,853
Yes!

574
00:44:33,453 --> 00:44:36,653
Yes, I always wanted to fucking kill
somebody who fucked with me in traffic.

575
00:44:38,252 --> 00:44:40,653
Well, you want to
kill the driver of the pickup

576
00:44:40,893 --> 00:44:41,653
or the owner?

577
00:44:44,732 --> 00:44:46,251
They may not be the same.

578
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,172
Driver.

579
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:52,653
Okay.

580
00:44:53,132 --> 00:44:55,933
We'll drive around till we get
a good look at him or her.

581
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:58,052
[Any problems] to kill a woman?

582
00:45:01,251 --> 00:45:02,973
No. An asshole is an asshole.

583
00:45:10,853 --> 00:45:12,492
I wasn't in town that night.

584
00:45:12,533 --> 00:45:14,172
My roommate was, maybe he saw something.

585
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:15,053
May I speak to him?

586
00:45:15,373 --> 00:45:18,573
He is in on his way to Tokyo right
now, he is also a flight attendant.

587
00:45:19,251 --> 00:45:21,853
Did the victims ever leave
their bedroom curtains open?

588
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:23,933
All the time.

589
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:26,666
I don't know if they thought we couldn't see them doing it,

590
00:45:26,716 --> 00:45:28,732
if that's why you are asking, or if they didn't care.

591
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:30,973
well, here is my card.

592
00:45:31,053 --> 00:45:32,013
If you could have your roommate call me

593
00:45:32,053 --> 00:45:34,973
and the people at this number know how to
reach me anytime at day or night.

594
00:45:35,007 --> 00:45:36,853
I won't be here, but
I will leave him a note.

595
00:45:36,893 --> 00:45:37,853
Ok great, thank you.

596
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:38,732
Sure.

597
00:46:31,132 --> 00:46:34,653
Would you recognize him if you saw
his driver's licence picture?

598
00:46:35,373 --> 00:46:35,933
Yeah.

599
00:46:38,053 --> 00:46:41,453
I'd memorize the licence
number, you write it down.

600
00:46:42,573 --> 00:46:43,373
I got it.

601
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:46,433
Wow.

602
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:50,453
Well, when you get
home, go on the internet,

603
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:53,533
find out everything you
can about this guy.

604
00:46:54,172 --> 00:46:55,773
We are not going to kill him tonight?

605
00:46:55,808 --> 00:46:56,732
No.

606
00:46:57,933 --> 00:47:00,698
We could, but then we
wouldn't be in control.

607
00:47:00,732 --> 00:47:05,853
We could leave loose ends,
and we both know the danger of that.

608
00:47:06,973 --> 00:47:07,853
Yeah, we do.

609
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:15,853
What are you-- we doing?

610
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:21,132
What are you doing?

611
00:47:21,653 --> 00:47:22,853
Look at me.

612
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:24,853
- Look at me!
- Why?

613
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:28,453
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

614
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:29,453
Close.

615
00:47:31,373 --> 00:47:33,373
What's the licence plate number?

616
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:38,653
Shit!

617
00:47:38,732 --> 00:47:40,013
P4...

618
00:47:40,053 --> 00:47:41,132
no

619
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:42,251
2...

620
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:44,172
I know it's Oregon.

621
00:47:44,853 --> 00:47:45,853
Because of the tree?

622
00:47:48,053 --> 00:47:48,813
Don't feel bad.

623
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:51,653
I've been doing this a
long time. Pen, paper.

624
00:47:52,053 --> 00:47:53,933
Look out the window and write it down.

625
00:47:56,653 --> 00:47:58,172
What was your first time like?

626
00:47:59,132 --> 00:48:01,853
You really don't want to know
that much about me, Mr. Smith.

627
00:48:18,973 --> 00:48:20,333
No, I don't think it was right, go back.

628
00:48:22,251 --> 00:48:24,453
Ok, we are in.

629
00:48:24,973 --> 00:48:28,172
For all the taxes we pay you'd think
they'd make it more difficult...

630
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:30,333
to hack into the police personnel file.

631
00:48:33,132 --> 00:48:35,132
Her father is John Atwood, why...?

632
00:48:35,172 --> 00:48:37,132
Why does that ring a bell?

633
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:39,373
Someone you did business with?

634
00:48:39,933 --> 00:48:41,292
Someone we...

635
00:48:41,533 --> 00:48:42,653
killed?

636
00:48:42,732 --> 00:48:44,251
No, not someone we killed.

637
00:48:45,132 --> 00:48:46,653
Let me see here, MBA...
(Master of Business Association)

638
00:48:47,373 --> 00:48:50,092
College of William & Mary.
She has been a cop for 12 years,

639
00:48:50,132 --> 00:48:52,333
married Dr. Carlson,

640
00:48:52,453 --> 00:48:56,172
divorced Dr. Carlson,
married a Jesse Vialo.

641
00:48:56,973 --> 00:48:59,233
a restaurateur,
seperates from Jesse Vialo,

642
00:48:59,852 --> 00:49:02,653
sued for support by Jesse Vialo, seeing...

643
00:49:03,092 --> 00:49:04,653
seeing a shrink

644
00:49:04,732 --> 00:49:06,453
because of Jesse Vialo.

645
00:49:09,251 --> 00:49:11,413
She has caught a lot of people.

646
00:49:11,453 --> 00:49:16,333
And look here, this is not the first
time she has been looking for us.

647
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:19,853
Okay, here we are.

648
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:25,533
Jesse Vialo, good looking,
a little younger than she is.

649
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:28,573
Younger, restaurateur...

650
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:31,898
She married him on a
rebound from the doctor

651
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:35,251
and I'll bet he married her
for her money and connections.

652
00:49:35,853 --> 00:49:38,973
Just because the old men is rich
doesn't mean she is rich.

653
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:43,251
Maybe is one of the kind of guys
that'd rather give it to the opera

654
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:44,453
than to his kids.

655
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:50,573
What does she have to declare?
Any outside incoming holdings?

656
00:50:00,653 --> 00:50:01,613
Oh, you are a...

657
00:50:01,653 --> 00:50:03,251
You are a genius.

658
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:07,533
The opera didn't get much.

659
00:50:10,853 --> 00:50:15,013
Why would a woman, worth
60 plus million dollars...

660
00:50:15,653 --> 00:50:17,132
and probably more to come...

661
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:20,453
want to be a cop?

662
00:50:21,653 --> 00:50:23,132
I like that about her.

663
00:50:25,453 --> 00:50:29,013
You are a such a fucking snob, Earl.
You like her because she is rich.

664
00:50:29,251 --> 00:50:31,373
No, I like her because she has
found something that's hers,

665
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:33,853
It's not the family business,
and she is good at it.

666
00:50:34,653 --> 00:50:37,773
I'd like Jane to find
something that's hers...

667
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:39,973
and that she could be good at.

668
00:50:43,853 --> 00:50:47,292
That's exactly why Atwood
scares the shit out of me.

669
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,333
She's a cop who doesn't
need the money...

670
00:50:50,573 --> 00:50:52,538
and she is looking for us.

671
00:50:52,573 --> 00:50:54,573
That's one fucking dangerous human being.

672
00:50:56,973 --> 00:50:59,853
The fact that you are not wrong
just not makes me admire her...

673
00:51:00,251 --> 00:51:01,373
any less.

674
00:51:01,853 --> 00:51:02,853
Hey Nancy!

675
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:03,738
Hi Trace,

676
00:51:03,773 --> 00:51:05,373
Thank you for meeting me here

677
00:51:05,408 --> 00:51:06,172
- I got you a latte.
- Thanks.

678
00:51:06,251 --> 00:51:08,732
Do you mind if we walk and talk
while I hear about your big idea?

679
00:51:08,773 --> 00:51:09,653
Oh, sure.

680
00:51:09,773 --> 00:51:10,973
You really want to settle this?

681
00:51:11,007 --> 00:51:11,773
If I can.

682
00:51:13,853 --> 00:51:15,053
I'd like to use your father.

683
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:16,453
No.

684
00:51:16,853 --> 00:51:18,413
My father does nothing for nothing.

685
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:22,172
Tracy, I understand, but your
father has a lot of political muscle.

686
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:23,732
His pull won't make everything go away,

687
00:51:23,773 --> 00:51:25,053
but it would be a tremendous help.

688
00:51:25,092 --> 00:51:26,053
Absolutely not.

689
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:27,413
You're right.

690
00:51:27,453 --> 00:51:28,933
We could have done this all on the phone.

691
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,533
If you are willing to play the game
and ride the desk for a year,

692
00:51:31,573 --> 00:51:33,613
I'm sure we can settle it
at 1.25, 1.5 (million $)

693
00:51:33,653 --> 00:51:34,938
I'm not sitting on a desk.

694
00:51:34,973 --> 00:51:36,732
Then the only other option is your father.

695
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:37,653
Or money.

696
00:51:40,653 --> 00:51:42,172
1.5 and that's it.

697
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:43,632
Okay.

698
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:45,053
I'll call them today.

699
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:48,973
I just need to get this
done as soon as possible.

700
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:51,853
That's what Jesse is counting on.

701
00:51:53,132 --> 00:51:54,653
I'll call you when I have something.

702
00:51:57,533 --> 00:51:58,453
Oh, Tracy.

703
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,251
Your husband says there's a picture of him
holding some trophy that you still have?

704
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,172
What picture? He has everything.

705
00:52:06,573 --> 00:52:08,453
He claims it's his favourite picture...

706
00:52:08,573 --> 00:52:10,573
and you put it up where
you store your suitcases.

707
00:52:11,653 --> 00:52:12,333
I'll look.

708
00:52:13,251 --> 00:52:13,773
I know.

709
00:52:14,251 --> 00:52:16,973
Petty, you are going through a divorce.

710
00:52:18,653 --> 00:52:20,053
Thanks for the latte.

711
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:45,251
I told you I was coming back to get you.

712
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:48,333
I already found a place
where I'm going to hang you.

713
00:52:50,932 --> 00:52:52,953
First, I'm going watch her...

714
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,873
have some fun with you.

715
00:52:57,653 --> 00:53:01,132
Then she is going to watch me
have some fun with you.

716
00:53:02,172 --> 00:53:03,653
You know the drill.

717
00:53:16,172 --> 00:53:17,251
Don't fucking move!

718
00:53:17,453 --> 00:53:18,333
Shoot me!

719
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:21,373
Come on, shoot me, motherfucker!

720
00:53:21,473 --> 00:53:23,473

721
00:53:23,573 --> 00:53:25,573

722
00:53:59,873 --> 00:54:01,873
5 down...

723
00:54:01,973 --> 00:54:03,973
'Sleeper's demon.'

724
00:54:04,073 --> 00:54:06,073
Sleeper's demon.

725
00:54:07,273 --> 00:54:08,773
Incubus.

726
00:54:12,693 --> 00:54:14,212
Maybe he went home with someone else.

727
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:16,693
Can you still see his pickup?

728
00:54:18,853 --> 00:54:20,573
This is not the kind of guy...

729
00:54:20,613 --> 00:54:23,853
who leaves his pickup in an
unguarded lot overnight.

730
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:26,318
How do you know that?

731
00:54:26,453 --> 00:54:29,413
Somebody didn't do
their homework last night.

732
00:54:34,292 --> 00:54:38,453
'Tom Sawyer's villain.'

733
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:46,533
Let me get it.'Injun Joe'.

734
00:54:46,568 --> 00:54:47,453
Yeah!

735
00:54:57,251 --> 00:54:58,773
Where do we know that guy from?

736
00:55:04,813 --> 00:55:07,853
You really should pay more
attention to what you read, Earl.

737
00:55:07,893 --> 00:55:09,813
That's what I have you for, Marshall.

738
00:55:11,092 --> 00:55:14,273
His picture was on the frontpage
of the papers a couple of days ago,

739
00:55:14,308 --> 00:55:17,453
because he escaped from jail.
He is the killer they call 'The Hangman'.

740
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:21,373
You remember that cop...

741
00:55:21,408 --> 00:55:22,613
who you like?

742
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:24,292
Atwood?

743
00:55:26,613 --> 00:55:31,053
Who is chasing us?
She is the one who put him away.

744
00:55:33,453 --> 00:55:34,413
Wow, wow.

745
00:55:34,653 --> 00:55:36,172
What would life be...

746
00:55:36,853 --> 00:55:38,251
without surprises?

747
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:39,953
There he is!

748
00:55:40,251 --> 00:55:40,853
There he is!

749
00:55:44,773 --> 00:55:45,773
I'm in hot wild.

750
00:55:46,453 --> 00:55:49,693
This guy, I bet he's got all sorts of
plans for tonight and tomorrow night.

751
00:55:51,613 --> 00:55:53,132
He has no idea he'll already be dead!

752
00:55:54,773 --> 00:55:56,172
He will not be able to do any of them.

753
00:56:02,573 --> 00:56:04,453
I don't think I want to kill this guy.

754
00:56:06,251 --> 00:56:07,053
What?

755
00:56:07,453 --> 00:56:08,613
Oh, I...

756
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:11,653
love what you are thinking!

757
00:56:13,092 --> 00:56:16,251
You have no idea of what I am thinking.

758
00:56:16,732 --> 00:56:17,533
Yes, I do.

759
00:56:18,013 --> 00:56:20,251
And it's wonderfully twisted.

760
00:56:21,373 --> 00:56:23,212
Wait a minute, are you--?
You promised!

761
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:25,053
I know I said we would,

762
00:56:26,773 --> 00:56:28,613
but I don't think it would be that much fun.

763
00:56:28,648 --> 00:56:30,172
So that's it? Just 'no'.

764
00:56:31,453 --> 00:56:32,292
Yes.

765
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:35,251
- Uh-oh.
- So...

766
00:56:37,413 --> 00:56:38,732
You got the licence plate?

767
00:56:38,773 --> 00:56:39,413
Yeah.

768
00:56:40,853 --> 00:56:44,973
They found the Van in an underground parking
lot about two miles from where they left you.

769
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:46,251
It was stolen last night.

770
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,413
We are checking security camera tapes.

771
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:50,251
If Meeks and the woman left in a car,

772
00:56:50,288 --> 00:56:51,613
we'll have a licence plate number.

773
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:54,092
These are the women we have
pictures of who know Meeks.

774
00:56:54,172 --> 00:56:55,853
None of the attendents
remember seeing them.

775
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:00,613
What about that chiropractor Alvin
Griffin, the other one who sold Meeks steroids?

776
00:57:00,648 --> 00:57:02,773
We've had a tap on his phone
ever since Meeks escaped.

777
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:04,853
No contact there so far...

778
00:57:04,933 --> 00:57:05,973
and sure he is not going to talk to us.

779
00:57:06,453 --> 00:57:07,693
How about a warrant
to search the house?

780
00:57:07,853 --> 00:57:09,613
You get me in the door
and he'll talk to me.

781
00:57:09,653 --> 00:57:10,613
How is your divorce going?

782
00:57:13,413 --> 00:57:15,533
I took your advice and
told my lawyer to settle.

783
00:57:16,613 --> 00:57:18,251
None of these are the woman in the van.

784
00:57:18,653 --> 00:57:19,893
Whoa, I'm trying to stitch you up here.

785
00:57:20,053 --> 00:57:21,813
And your ego can handle that?

786
00:57:23,613 --> 00:57:25,613
No, but it doesn't
likes the other choices.

787
00:57:25,973 --> 00:57:29,893
Because the FBI is wiring hard on me
to take over the thumbprint killer.

788
00:57:31,773 --> 00:57:34,092
Until Meeks is caught,
Hawkins is with you.

789
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:39,132
Nothing personal, Hawkins, but I don't
think you'd take a bullet for me.

790
00:57:39,573 --> 00:57:41,653
I wouldn't take the bullet,
I might push you out the way

791
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:45,053
I'll give two days, then I want a
progress report of your divorce.

792
00:57:45,853 --> 00:57:47,613
Look, I have all the pieces
for the thumbprint killer.

793
00:57:47,653 --> 00:57:49,773
I'm just not looking at it the right way.

794
00:57:50,573 --> 00:57:52,613
I'll keep the FBI out
of it for three days.

795
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:55,893
That is ugly.

796
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:06,492
Mr. Smith wants you to
notice that he's pouting.

797
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:10,172
Yes, I know.

798
00:58:28,933 --> 00:58:31,453
I know you are upset,
Mr. Smith, and I am sorry.

799
00:58:32,053 --> 00:58:34,212
Yeah. I'm upset.

800
00:58:38,053 --> 00:58:41,092
Maybe I was a little brut
back there, but let me explain.

801
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:45,053
Finding someone you think would
be fun to kill is a bit like...

802
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,138
Hell, it's a bit like falling in love,

803
00:58:48,172 --> 00:58:51,132
you meet a lot of candidates, you
like some of them and they're nice.

804
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:53,413
But they are not right.

805
00:58:54,053 --> 00:58:55,573
And that special one comes along...

806
00:58:56,172 --> 00:58:59,533
and your heart... it beats faster.

807
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:02,533
And you know: That's the one.

808
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:07,092
The man in the pickup did not
make my heart beat faster.

809
00:59:08,251 --> 00:59:09,013
Ok.

810
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:11,893
The man didn't make your
heart beat faster. Then who?

811
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,613
I don't know but I think...

812
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:18,773
I think I have someone in mind.

813
00:59:19,933 --> 00:59:21,492
Do you want me to do some work on it?

814
00:59:21,773 --> 00:59:23,453
No, let's just...

815
00:59:24,292 --> 00:59:26,212
Let's just see how it plays out.

816
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:30,773
That's what I'm talking
about, that's my problem.

817
00:59:31,453 --> 00:59:33,732
That...that makes me feel
like I'm being jerked around.

818
00:59:33,768 --> 00:59:36,013
It was supposed to be last night,
then it was going to be tonight,

819
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,613
and now it's 'Let's
see how it plays out'?

820
00:59:39,092 --> 00:59:39,933
I feel like you're...

821
00:59:40,013 --> 00:59:41,933
I feel like you are bagging out of our deal.

822
00:59:43,933 --> 00:59:45,533
- I don't like how that feels.
- I promise you...

823
00:59:45,773 --> 00:59:47,773
I promise you it will happen.

824
00:59:48,413 --> 00:59:48,973
When?

825
00:59:49,933 --> 00:59:51,773
When is it going to happen,

826
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:53,132
Mr. Brooks, when?

827
00:59:54,212 --> 00:59:56,973
Tomorrow night. Same time.

828
00:59:57,773 --> 01:00:00,453
When you come out of your
building, I want you to turn right,

829
01:00:01,053 --> 01:00:03,933
go to the first street
that you can go West on.

830
01:00:04,456 --> 01:00:06,972
I will pick you up, on that street.

831
01:00:07,552 --> 01:00:08,333
Okay.

832
01:00:13,536 --> 01:00:18,333
I want to do this, but if killing
is to drag out, I can change my mind.

833
01:00:20,615 --> 01:00:22,695
Don't you think I
want to do this, Mr. Smith?

834
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:26,052
Maybe you don't think
that you have to anymore!

835
01:00:36,853 --> 01:00:40,734
Even if that guy was charming
and funny I still would not like him.

836
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:16,251
Hi

837
01:01:16,656 --> 01:01:17,616
Hi.

838
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:20,735
What can I do for you?

839
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:23,457
Detective Smolny,
Portland Police Department.

840
01:01:23,776 --> 01:01:26,933
This is Detective Carfagno,
she is in Palo Alto, California.

841
01:01:41,537 --> 01:01:42,132
Emma.

842
01:01:44,457 --> 01:01:45,091
Emma!

843
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:53,892
Did Jane ever tell you that there
was a murderer at her school?

844
01:01:54,696 --> 01:01:55,375
No.

845
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:56,656
Nothing?

846
01:01:58,052 --> 01:02:01,457
Not that her friend died
or somebody she knew died?

847
01:02:01,491 --> 01:02:04,091
or some... somebody in her dorm died?

848
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:07,458
No, why?

849
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,251
Well, there are two detectives
downstairs, one of them is from Palo Alto.

850
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:16,251
They want to ask her some questions about a murder
that occurred there shortly before she came home.

851
01:02:16,292 --> 01:02:17,777
Oh, my gosh.

852
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:22,577
Well, I'm sure if she was
close to somebody who was murdered,

853
01:02:22,611 --> 01:02:23,458
she would have said something.

854
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:24,736
Yeah.

855
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,933
I called Roger. He suggested
a criminal attorney.

856
01:02:31,577 --> 01:02:32,853
They will be here within the hour.

857
01:02:35,933 --> 01:02:36,933
Yeah, I'll get dressed.

858
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:42,091
- This is too close.
- I know!

859
01:02:52,617 --> 01:02:54,577
Jane, how well did you know Philip Ramsey?

860
01:02:54,933 --> 01:02:58,577
He and I were in a couple of
classes together. That's about it.

861
01:02:58,697 --> 01:03:00,972
- Did you ever drive him to class?
- No.

862
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:04,498
You've ever been to his apartment?
Do you know where he lives?

863
01:03:05,091 --> 01:03:07,013
Which complex was he in?

864
01:03:07,091 --> 01:03:08,251
What happened to your BMW, Jane?

865
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:10,972
It was actually stolen...

866
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:15,052
Well, that was interesting.

867
01:04:16,972 --> 01:04:18,052
You know, I don't feel so well.

868
01:04:18,853 --> 01:04:20,853
I think you should lie down, okay?

869
01:04:21,699 --> 01:04:22,972
I think she should lie down.

870
01:04:29,619 --> 01:04:31,933
Dad, I'm sorry I didn't
say anything before.

871
01:04:32,853 --> 01:04:35,933
It was really horrible, but I
didn't know the guy that well and...

872
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:40,853
It happened around the same time I found
out I was pregnant, so...

873
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:42,171
- ...just can I lie down?
- I understand.

874
01:04:47,172 --> 01:04:49,172
I am going to go up with her.

875
01:05:01,052 --> 01:05:03,091
Now tell me, what do I do?

876
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:09,933
She did it.

877
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:11,052
Didn't she?

878
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:14,292
Yeah.

879
01:05:15,853 --> 01:05:19,820
It'll take the cops a week to ten
days to put their case together and then...

880
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:23,541
...and then they will
come back and arrest her.

881
01:05:28,933 --> 01:05:31,416
What are you going to do?

882
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:51,933
Oh God!

883
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:54,052
Oh God!

884
01:05:54,091 --> 01:05:57,132
I've been afraid of this since
before she was born.

885
01:05:59,251 --> 01:06:01,052
She has...

886
01:06:01,251 --> 01:06:02,458
She has what I have.

887
01:06:03,781 --> 01:06:04,972
Yes, she does.

888
01:06:06,621 --> 01:06:09,013
But you're always smarter
about it, she was stupid.

889
01:06:11,251 --> 01:06:13,933
She did it because she got
off on it. Okay, I understand.

890
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:17,933
She did it for fun.
Okay, I understand.

891
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:25,091
But why didn't she think it through
a hatchet, and she left it there?

892
01:06:30,171 --> 01:06:32,013
You are pretty graphic all day.

893
01:06:32,052 --> 01:06:34,052
That was the shock of her making a mistake.

894
01:06:34,201 --> 01:06:35,630
What does she think I think?

895
01:06:37,052 --> 01:06:38,291
I wish she'd remember what she told me,

896
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,552
that the BMW was being driven across the country by her friend,

897
01:06:42,292 --> 01:06:45,210
and now, right, she tells
the cops that it was stolen.

898
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:48,853
You've always cleaned her bathroom,
whatever she did, all her life.

899
01:06:54,091 --> 01:06:58,171
It's the BMW. As anything
incriminating I hope it was stolen.

900
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,660
I hope she dropped it at the
bottom of a very deep lake.

901
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,661
Do you think she knows all
those troubles that she's in?

902
01:07:03,701 --> 01:07:08,822
I think she thought she had gotten
away with it until the cops showed up.

903
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:16,791
I should've listened to her, she was trying to tell me.

904
01:07:16,835 --> 01:07:18,171
It was there.

905
01:07:19,933 --> 01:07:22,011
'I didn't quit school
because I was pregnant.'

906
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:25,621
I should have dug deeper.

907
01:07:25,853 --> 01:07:29,782
And where would you be, but in
exactly the same place that you are in now?

908
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:32,251
It's not your fault, Earl.

909
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:36,707
Part of your problem with her
is that you always think it is.

910
01:07:36,741 --> 01:07:41,416
She has what I have, Marshall, so
on a very basic level, it is my fault!

911
01:07:42,822 --> 01:07:44,933
What are you going to do?

912
01:08:00,621 --> 01:08:03,500
Maybe the best thing for her
would be to let her go to jail.

913
01:08:09,662 --> 01:08:13,375
- What about her child?
- Emma and I will help her raise it.

914
01:08:17,091 --> 01:08:18,662
You might be right Earl, you know?

915
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:20,292
Just might be.

916
01:08:22,662 --> 01:08:26,292
Because if she's not stopped she is going
to kill again and if she really wants...

917
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:28,892
...to take over that box business

918
01:08:28,933 --> 01:08:31,210
the next victim could be...

919
01:08:34,662 --> 01:08:35,375
you.

920
01:08:40,312 --> 01:08:41,052
I...

921
01:08:42,783 --> 01:08:44,458
I don't think she would go that far.

922
01:08:58,458 --> 01:08:59,292
Hey.

923
01:08:59,853 --> 01:09:01,210
We've received a counter offer.

924
01:09:01,853 --> 01:09:03,210
Are you sitting down?

925
01:09:03,784 --> 01:09:04,933
Yeah, go ahead.

926
01:09:04,972 --> 01:09:06,663
5 million dollars.

927
01:09:07,933 --> 01:09:09,416
My God, you got to be kidding me.

928
01:09:10,171 --> 01:09:11,292
He can't get that, can he?

929
01:09:11,416 --> 01:09:13,968
No, no, no, my sense of it is that by asking for 5

930
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:16,933
they are hoping you'll settle anywhere between 2.5 and 3.

931
01:09:16,968 --> 01:09:17,583
Shit!

932
01:09:17,784 --> 01:09:18,784
Can you stall them?

933
01:09:19,052 --> 01:09:23,013
No, they know you want this done quickly
so they're going to expect a quick counter offer.

934
01:09:23,251 --> 01:09:26,743
Look, I need two days, just
wait 2 days, tell them...

935
01:09:27,812 --> 01:09:30,500
that it's a big number and that
I have to think about it.

936
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,132
OK.

937
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:34,052
Oh, and that picture that he wanted...

938
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:40,132
Tell him I couldn't find it.

939
01:09:45,171 --> 01:09:45,784
Yes, Mr. Brooks.

940
01:09:51,892 --> 01:09:52,663
Mr. Brooks?

941
01:09:54,251 --> 01:09:55,784
Before you open your mouth...

942
01:09:57,623 --> 01:09:59,892
be very sure this is the right...

943
01:10:00,458 --> 01:10:01,663
thing to do.

944
01:10:02,251 --> 01:10:04,416
I will never be sure.

945
01:10:07,458 --> 01:10:09,093
You get pissed at me

946
01:10:09,933 --> 01:10:13,458
because I'm always the one
argueing to go ahead and do murder.

947
01:10:13,787 --> 01:10:17,093
Not this time, Earl.
This is your decision.

948
01:10:17,933 --> 01:10:21,666
I know what's wrong.
I know in my heart it's wrong.

949
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:24,853
Then don't do it.

950
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:29,132
Go with Mr. Smith and let it finish that.

951
01:10:29,972 --> 01:10:33,666
And let the police put Jane in jail,
hopefully that will save her.

952
01:10:34,132 --> 01:10:38,625
And we can happily go on
with our tortured lives.

953
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:41,210
That's exactly what I want to do.

954
01:10:42,251 --> 01:10:45,787
That's exactly what I should do.
The thing is, she is my daughter.

955
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:48,853
And I love her.

956
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:51,416
Mr. Brooks?

957
01:10:57,705 --> 01:10:58,933
I'm going home.

958
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:03,251
Cancel everything for
the rest of the day.

959
01:11:03,583 --> 01:11:04,583
I'll take care of it.

960
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:08,666
If you 'need me' need me,
Sunday, I'll be in my studio.

961
01:11:09,093 --> 01:11:10,052
Call me there.

962
01:11:11,251 --> 01:11:15,375
I probably won't pick up,
so... just leave a message.

963
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:18,747
I'll try to not bother you.

964
01:11:46,972 --> 01:11:52,333
The thing that bothers me about this,
besides the fact that we are not prepared and...

965
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:56,666
a multitude of other things, is...

966
01:11:56,788 --> 01:12:00,747
What does Mr. Smith do when
he's walking west tonight and...

967
01:12:01,251 --> 01:12:04,972
...you don't show up.
That little freak will flip out.

968
01:12:07,892 --> 01:12:08,972
I will take care of it,

969
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:11,093
on the way to the airport.

970
01:12:15,251 --> 01:12:16,052
What are we doing?

971
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:19,666
'What are we doing?' 'What are we doing?'
You sound like a whiny-ass kid.

972
01:12:19,789 --> 01:12:23,210
- We are playing a hunch.
- We have been following this guy all day.

973
01:12:23,707 --> 01:12:25,093
He is boring, ok?

974
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:27,431
And everything we run on him
comes out clean.

975
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:29,712
Well, if it didn't,
it wouldn't be called a hunch.

976
01:12:30,541 --> 01:12:33,132
Meeks, he's the guy we
should be looking for, Meeks.

977
01:12:34,251 --> 01:12:37,093
Look where? Please, tell me.

978
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:41,789
Look, everyone knows who Meeks
is and is looking for him.

979
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:44,575
The chiropractor was the last link
to his old life that I know.

980
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:50,583
We are going to find him now, somebody will
turn him in, we are going to troop over him at a bus stop.

981
01:12:51,132 --> 01:12:52,933
On the other hand, nobody knows...

982
01:12:52,972 --> 01:12:55,093
who the thumbprint
killer is or where he is.

983
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:57,416
However, I have a fucking hunch.

984
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:59,093
that this guy, Bafford, does.

985
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:01,292
I've got 2 days to play that hunch

986
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:04,972
So if you think you are wasting your
time with me, then I'd be happy to do it alone.

987
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:08,541
I had a fight with my wife this morning.

988
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,052
What's your problem?

989
01:13:11,853 --> 01:13:13,790
My husband wants 5 million dollars.

990
01:13:24,292 --> 01:13:25,251
Here you are, Sir.

991
01:13:25,892 --> 01:13:26,812
Sir?

992
01:13:29,933 --> 01:13:30,812
Thank you.

993
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:40,790
God grant me the serenity to accept
the things that I cannot change.

994
01:13:42,052 --> 01:13:44,958
Courage to change the things that I can
and wisdom to know the difference.

995
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:47,654
Living one day at a time,
enjoying one moment at a time.

996
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:18,351
'not able to meet'

997
01:14:28,851 --> 01:14:30,851
'Do it same time tomorrow'

998
01:14:34,351 --> 01:14:36,351
'Don't be stupid'

999
01:14:38,093 --> 01:14:39,251
Good for you, asshole!

1000
01:14:47,312 --> 01:14:48,052
Remember me?

1001
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:50,666
Can you step out of the car,
please? I want to talk to you.

1002
01:14:56,583 --> 01:14:58,333
So, Mr Bafford, what is it
that you have to tell me?

1003
01:14:58,708 --> 01:15:00,333
What do you mean? I don't
have anything to tell you.

1004
01:15:01,052 --> 01:15:03,218
Really? Because I was driving around...

1005
01:15:03,251 --> 01:15:06,210
and I suddenly got this feeling that
you had something to tell me...

1006
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:07,132
about the murders.

1007
01:15:08,292 --> 01:15:08,853
No.

1008
01:15:10,052 --> 01:15:10,812
Nothing.

1009
01:15:11,093 --> 01:15:12,210
Oh, that is disappointing.

1010
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:17,500
Because, when I left
after we... we talked last time

1011
01:15:17,892 --> 01:15:20,708
I thought I had missed a clue
that was right in front of me...

1012
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:22,132
that could solve this whole case.

1013
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:25,251
I don't know why you would feel that.

1014
01:15:27,052 --> 01:15:31,933
Can you tell me that you are an amateur
potterer, that you like to make bowls and vases?

1015
01:15:31,972 --> 01:15:32,583
No.

1016
01:15:33,052 --> 01:15:38,292
I told you that my hobby was
photography and not pottery.

1017
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:41,791
Oh, maybe, maybe that was it.

1018
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:46,750
Flight attendant upstairs said that the
victims liked to keep their bedroom curtains...

1019
01:15:47,132 --> 01:15:48,458
open when they had sex.

1020
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:53,416
Can I see some of those
photos you took of that couple?

1021
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:18,791
You are harassing me, Detective Atwood.

1022
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:23,933
You knew very well that I'm not a
potterer and I don't have any pictures.

1023
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:25,666
So my feeling is that your feeling is wrong,

1024
01:16:25,795 --> 01:16:27,655
and you should just move your car and let me go home.

1025
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:33,791
What's your job here?
What... what do you do?

1026
01:16:35,093 --> 01:16:36,666
I am a mechanical engineer.

1027
01:16:37,933 --> 01:16:40,210
You got to be really
smart for that, don't you?

1028
01:16:41,093 --> 01:16:41,791
Yes.

1029
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:44,791
Then be smart, Mr. Bafford.

1030
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:48,853
Because you lied to me,
right there at the end.

1031
01:16:51,093 --> 01:16:52,292
I'll be watching you.

1032
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,251
When you want to tell me the truth,
you have to get in touch with me.

1033
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:58,625
See you later alligator.

1034
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:16,583
Captain Lister got us the
search warrant for Meeks Doctor.

1035
01:17:17,483 --> 01:17:18,110
That's good.

1036
01:17:18,251 --> 01:17:20,251
Goddamnit, this guy knows something.

1037
01:17:21,052 --> 01:17:22,972
Almost told me, and then something happened.

1038
01:17:23,093 --> 01:17:23,791
You think he did it?

1039
01:17:25,052 --> 01:17:26,972
I don't think it's quite that simple.

1040
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:29,458
Do you want to call for backup?

1041
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:31,583
Yeah, we should be ready for anything.

1042
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:33,335
In fact, get a K-9 (canine) unit
and a chopper,

1043
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:36,625
I don't have the energy to chase
this guy if he decides to run.

1044
01:18:10,576 --> 01:18:11,808
<i>This is the Police. The house is surrounded! <i>

1045
01:18:15,558 --> 01:18:16,791
<i> Alvin Griffin, 
fold your hands on top of your head! <i>

1046
01:18:22,853 --> 01:18:23,416
Clear!

1047
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:28,625
Meeks was a steroid freak.

1048
01:18:28,812 --> 01:18:30,812
This was ususally full.
It's empty now.

1049
01:18:31,933 --> 01:18:33,210
You think Meeks has Alvin with him?

1050
01:18:33,933 --> 01:18:36,500
He thinks Alvin turned him in. On me!

1051
01:19:28,052 --> 01:19:31,791
Hawkins, meet Alvin Griffin.

1052
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:43,375
How do you feel?

1053
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,458
Dirty.

1054
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:50,625
That's understandable.

1055
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:55,853
You've never killed for this reason
before, the feeling will pass.

1056
01:20:56,093 --> 01:20:57,052
I don't think so.

1057
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,708
It's the whole thing, Marshall.

1058
01:21:00,933 --> 01:21:04,458
If I could find a way to just end it all,

1059
01:21:05,251 --> 01:21:07,666
...disappear, where there's
absolutely no trace of me.

1060
01:21:09,093 --> 01:21:10,633
Because eventually I will get caught doing this.

1061
01:21:10,683 --> 01:21:12,292
That would be very embarrassing for me...

1062
01:21:12,933 --> 01:21:14,093
and Emma and Jane.

1063
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:16,583
So I have been thinking.

1064
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:22,292
Is there a way that Mr. Smith
could kill me and make me disappear?

1065
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:28,972
Rule no.1: Mr. Smith is
not smart enough to do that.

1066
01:21:29,007 --> 01:21:29,750
I know that.

1067
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:34,750
No.2: There is no reason, if you are
careful, to believe you will ever get caught.

1068
01:21:37,052 --> 01:21:39,933
I know that I will have to plan
it for Mr Smith but I think...

1069
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:42,933
I think that is what I want to do.

1070
01:21:43,093 --> 01:21:47,052
Well, I'm not particulary
fond of that plan, Earl.

1071
01:21:47,093 --> 01:21:51,583
Remember? If you die, I go with
you and I like being alive. I like...

1072
01:21:52,812 --> 01:21:55,583
eating, I like fucking, I like killing.

1073
01:21:56,892 --> 01:22:00,251
I have to end it, Marshall,
one way or another.

1074
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,013
And I think this is the best way.

1075
01:22:09,892 --> 01:22:11,052
Fuck you then!

1076
01:22:13,952 --> 01:22:15,352
Come on.

1077
01:22:38,666 --> 01:22:39,583
- Hi.
- Hi.

1078
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,097
You worked all night?

1079
01:22:41,132 --> 01:22:43,933
(Yes, I had to sort out packets
for 2 women. )

1080
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:45,458
(A packet of money. )

1081
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:47,251
Will be fine.

1082
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:58,210
(And I have these Chinese clients
that I am trying to get right. )

1083
01:23:24,052 --> 01:23:26,251
Hey Daddy, I thought
you've been gone already.

1084
01:23:28,132 --> 01:23:32,210
Roger called. There was another
murder last night at your school.

1085
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:35,791
Yeah

1086
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:38,892
Gone in the same way
as the one they talked to you about,

1087
01:23:38,933 --> 01:23:42,251
right down to the hatchet
being left at the scene.

1088
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:47,853
They think they have a serial killer.

1089
01:23:48,812 --> 01:23:52,625
Obviously, you were here last night.
So, you are in the clear.

1090
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:55,251
Well, it's...

1091
01:23:56,541 --> 01:23:57,972
It's good news, isn't it? I mean...

1092
01:23:58,708 --> 01:24:01,791
Even if you are innocent it's
good to know you are not a suspect.

1093
01:24:04,292 --> 01:24:05,052
Yeah...

1094
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:09,093
How's the... how's the morning sickness?

1095
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:13,625
Better than yesterday.

1096
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,458
Do you want to have lunch with me today?

1097
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:22,292
I'd love to but I don't
know how I will feel later.

1098
01:24:24,052 --> 01:24:24,625
Thank you.

1099
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:41,625
Do you love me, Jane?

1100
01:24:43,892 --> 01:24:45,625
Of course I love you, Daddy.

1101
01:24:46,458 --> 01:24:47,416
You are my father.

1102
01:24:56,251 --> 01:24:58,210
Have you decided whether
or not to have the baby?

1103
01:25:00,093 --> 01:25:00,892
Not yet.

1104
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:45,052
It's time to go.

1105
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:54,625
Dear Emma and Jane, my loves.

1106
01:25:56,251 --> 01:26:01,251
I have a terminal illness and instead
of subjecting you to my deterioration

1107
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:04,708
I have decided to disappear.

1108
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:08,791
Do not try to find me,
I don't want to be found.

1109
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:12,052
Please believe that the
time I spent with you

1110
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:15,013
brought me the greatest joy of my life.

1111
01:26:16,933 --> 01:26:19,812
Love, Dad.

1112
01:26:23,251 --> 01:26:25,093
So you are going to go through with it?

1113
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,666
It's all planned to work out.

1114
01:26:43,791 --> 01:26:47,292
- Ready to rock and roll, Mr. Smith?
- Yeah.

1115
01:26:59,251 --> 01:27:00,583
I smell gun oil,

1116
01:27:01,972 --> 01:27:03,458
different gun oil than yours.

1117
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:05,583
He brought his gun.

1118
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:09,972
If he not gets what he wants,
he plans to kill me.

1119
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:15,132
Oh, now I get it.
You're counting on this.

1120
01:27:15,933 --> 01:27:17,251
It has a certain logic.

1121
01:27:18,093 --> 01:27:23,933
But if you plan was to have him kill you,
why do you have to kill somebody else first?

1122
01:27:26,013 --> 01:27:28,625
I'll need to see that to get up
the courage to kill me.

1123
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:32,853
Not even you believe that, Earl.

1124
01:27:34,132 --> 01:27:35,210
This makes it more exciting,

1125
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:36,013
doesn't it?

1126
01:27:36,853 --> 01:27:39,093
I think that he's going to kill you
after you killed somebody else...

1127
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:41,052
you're getting your rocks on, big time.

1128
01:27:42,292 --> 01:27:43,625
That's why you are doing this.

1129
01:27:43,933 --> 01:27:45,500
Not true. And if it were,

1130
01:27:46,416 --> 01:27:48,333
so what?

1131
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:55,751
Hello.

1132
01:27:56,251 --> 01:27:57,132
Yeah, put it through.

1133
01:27:57,933 --> 01:27:59,052
I just got your message.

1134
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:03,093
The weird thing is that
they closed that curtains.

1135
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:07,541
At first they were open like they always were
and they were make love like they always did.

1136
01:28:07,933 --> 01:28:10,218
Then, when I looked again,
the curtains were closed.

1137
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:13,791
And there were what looked like camera
flashes coming from behind the curtains.

1138
01:28:14,132 --> 01:28:15,132
Camera flashes?

1139
01:28:15,171 --> 01:28:16,251
That's what it looked like.

1140
01:28:17,093 --> 01:28:18,708
That's why he poses them.

1141
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:20,052
I'm sorry?

1142
01:28:20,251 --> 01:28:21,541
No, no, no. Nothing.

1143
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:24,853
Look, the guy you should talk to
is the guy on the floor below us.

1144
01:28:24,972 --> 01:28:26,500
Would that be a Mr. Bafford?

1145
01:28:26,812 --> 01:28:31,416
Yeah, he told me once that he had taken some
great pictures of that couple making love.

1146
01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:33,132
He is the one you should talk to.

1147
01:28:33,853 --> 01:28:35,052
Okay, great. Thank you.

1148
01:28:40,853 --> 01:28:41,625
Yeah?

1149
01:28:41,791 --> 01:28:44,625
Hawkins, meet me at Bafford's
apartment with a search warrant.

1150
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:53,666
Put these on.

1151
01:29:03,251 --> 01:29:05,251
Nice outfit.

1152
01:29:15,132 --> 01:29:18,093
Try a couple of deep
breaths through your nose.

1153
01:29:21,052 --> 01:29:23,791
- I have to take a crap so bad.
- What?

1154
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:26,171
I have to take a crap.

1155
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:29,791
We won't be long.

1156
01:30:05,416 --> 01:30:06,583
I was with your wife's lawyer.

1157
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,375
They are thinking about the 5 million.

1158
01:30:23,933 --> 01:30:26,625
Realistically, how much do
you think we can get?

1159
01:30:26,933 --> 01:30:31,052
Oh, if we go to court,
best case scenario: 2.

1160
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:33,541
I think we should hold fare up for 3.

1161
01:30:34,933 --> 01:30:40,666
Let's not get biggish.
2.5, 2.7 'd still be a great deal.

1162
01:30:47,093 --> 01:30:48,500
There's more if we want it.

1163
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:51,853
We have to do this quickly.

1164
01:30:51,933 --> 01:30:53,892
Remember? Maurice is meeting us here.

1165
01:30:55,353 --> 01:30:56,132
Yes.

1166
01:30:58,853 --> 01:30:59,853
I asked her to join us.

1167
01:31:00,892 --> 01:31:01,853
It's not funny.

1168
01:31:08,132 --> 01:31:09,666
Are we alone?

1169
01:31:11,013 --> 01:31:12,666
Yeah.

1170
01:31:24,292 --> 01:31:25,171
Hello.

1171
01:31:32,052 --> 01:31:34,210
Do it. Do it!

1172
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:37,416
Don't do that.

1173
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:42,251
Mr. Bafford?

1174
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:45,458
Mr. Bafford?

1175
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,812
Yes! Wooooh! Yes.

1176
01:31:49,853 --> 01:31:51,458
Yes. You are the fucking man.

1177
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:55,013
Oh, man, did you see
the look on her face?

1178
01:31:55,791 --> 01:31:58,666
The look on her
fucking face was great!

1179
01:31:59,416 --> 01:32:00,708
It was great, it was fantastic.

1180
01:32:01,251 --> 01:32:01,892
That was...

1181
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:05,933
everything that I hoped it would be.

1182
01:32:06,853 --> 01:32:09,052
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1183
01:32:12,171 --> 01:32:14,625
Mr. Bafford, knock knock.

1184
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:20,458
Anybody home?

1185
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:30,791
Mr. Bafford?

1186
01:32:33,892 --> 01:32:35,500
Hello?

1187
01:32:56,516 --> 01:32:58,271
Obviously Bafford is gone. Hey!

1188
01:33:00,108 --> 01:33:00,775
Obviously Bafford is gone.

1189
01:33:01,916 --> 01:33:04,093
Goddamnit Hawkins, don't you ever knock?

1190
01:33:04,132 --> 01:33:06,210
I wasn't able to get a search warrant.

1191
01:33:06,251 --> 01:33:08,853
We might ourselves gotten lucky.
This is the moving company's work order.

1192
01:33:08,933 --> 01:33:11,416
and this looks like the address where
they are taking Bafford's stuff.

1193
01:33:12,093 --> 01:33:12,853
Where were you when you called me?

1194
01:33:13,583 --> 01:33:14,625
I was at home, in bed.

1195
01:33:15,052 --> 01:33:15,933
Can you prove that?

1196
01:33:16,853 --> 01:33:19,853
I was at home, in bed.
Why do I need to prove that?

1197
01:33:22,093 --> 01:33:24,052
Your husband Jesse and his
lawyer were killed tonight.

1198
01:33:28,013 --> 01:33:28,933
Get the fuck out.

1199
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:32,093
Looks like the thumbprint killer.

1200
01:33:32,625 --> 01:33:35,666
I have an order to bring
you in for questioning.

1201
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:38,171
Why?

1202
01:33:38,853 --> 01:33:41,586
I did't want Jesse dead.
Look, I hated what he was doing to me,

1203
01:33:41,636 --> 01:33:42,853
but I didn't want him dead.

1204
01:33:42,892 --> 01:33:44,625
Got on record you said
you wanted him dead.

1205
01:33:45,853 --> 01:33:48,093
Who better to fake a
thumbprint killing than you?

1206
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:50,625
You don't actually believe I'd do that.

1207
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:54,458
If our jobs have taught us anything, Tracy,
it is that people do strange things.

1208
01:33:54,972 --> 01:33:56,296
They just want to ask you some questions.

1209
01:33:56,333 --> 01:33:59,052
And I'm happyto answer the questions
after we go check out this address.

1210
01:33:59,093 --> 01:34:00,052
- I have to take you in.
- Look.

1211
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:03,750
This is the answer to the
thumbprint killer and this is where I'm going.

1212
01:34:03,933 --> 01:34:06,625
Don't make me cuff you,
because I will if I have to.

1213
01:34:07,666 --> 01:34:08,500
Hey, hey!

1214
01:34:14,052 --> 01:34:15,666
It'd be really nice
if you could go with me.

1215
01:34:15,933 --> 01:34:18,625
But if you do and this goes
bad, they are going to burn your ass.

1216
01:34:19,171 --> 01:34:20,052
So this never happened.

1217
01:34:20,093 --> 01:34:21,210
You're nuts.

1218
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:22,708
Yeah, that's what they say.

1219
01:34:27,052 --> 01:34:28,251
Here comes the gun.

1220
01:34:29,251 --> 01:34:29,933
Yep.

1221
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:34,458
What are you doing?

1222
01:34:35,791 --> 01:34:37,500
You are smart enough to
figure that out, Mr. Brooks.

1223
01:34:38,251 --> 01:34:40,750
Well, we are going 65
miles an hour, Mr. Smith.

1224
01:34:40,791 --> 01:34:43,708
If you shoot me now, there's
a good chance that we both die.

1225
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:45,853
Not now. Take this next off ramp.

1226
01:34:47,933 --> 01:34:49,052
You mean this one?

1227
01:34:52,251 --> 01:34:54,171
That wouldn't be very
smart, I mean now, would it?

1228
01:34:59,416 --> 01:35:00,892
Think about this now, nut nuts:

1229
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:05,791
You pissed yourself back there, you left your
DNA at the scene of a double homicide...

1230
01:35:05,808 --> 01:35:08,750
and there is nothing to
indicate that I was ever there.

1231
01:35:10,132 --> 01:35:13,210
The cops do an analysys
of that urine, and they will.

1232
01:35:14,132 --> 01:35:16,013
You are the thumbprint killer.

1233
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:21,933
No, no. I have pictures of
you from the first murder.

1234
01:35:22,251 --> 01:35:24,666
Yes, but what were you
doing at the second murder?

1235
01:35:29,666 --> 01:35:30,972
Let me help you with the fly.

1236
01:35:32,666 --> 01:35:34,750
You say that I've
forced you to come along

1237
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:35,812
and if I'm not here,

1238
01:35:36,933 --> 01:35:38,625
more specifically my body is not here

1239
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:41,666
to say otherwise, you might
have had a chance to (get out of this mess).

1240
01:35:42,853 --> 01:35:44,750
You are probably asking yourself:
Why would I help you?

1241
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:49,013
Well, I'm tired, Mr. Smith.

1242
01:35:49,292 --> 01:35:50,376
I am tired of killing,

1243
01:35:50,416 --> 01:35:51,920
but I'm an addict. I can't quit.

1244
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:54,325
I've tried, but I cannot do it on my own.

1245
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:56,052
So I need you to kill me.

1246
01:35:56,750 --> 01:36:00,132
But I need for you to do it smart.
Like in a way that I disappear

1247
01:36:00,853 --> 01:36:03,251
and my family never knows what I was.

1248
01:36:05,812 --> 01:36:06,458
How?

1249
01:36:06,972 --> 01:36:08,251
How do I fucking do that?

1250
01:36:12,251 --> 01:36:13,933
There's a cemetery I know about.

1251
01:36:17,052 --> 01:36:20,210
We'll find an open grave, you shoot me.

1252
01:36:20,892 --> 01:36:22,210
I'll fall into the grave.

1253
01:36:23,666 --> 01:36:26,010
You'll shovel in just enough
earth to cover me.

1254
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:28,110
Tomorrow, a casket is lowered onto me.

1255
01:36:29,110 --> 01:36:30,810
And I've disappeared.

1256
01:36:31,251 --> 01:36:32,791
It's a good plan, don't you think?

1257
01:36:36,132 --> 01:36:38,791
Why? Why should I trust you?

1258
01:36:41,013 --> 01:36:42,575
You don't have to trust me, Mr. Smith.

1259
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:43,972
You are the man holding the gun.

1260
01:36:44,791 --> 01:36:47,093
You saw me put mine
in the trunk, remember?

1261
01:36:52,132 --> 01:36:52,791
I know.

1262
01:36:55,093 --> 01:36:56,458
You really want me to kill you?

1263
01:37:00,292 --> 01:37:01,093
Yes.

1264
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:06,210
Okay. Okay.

1265
01:37:07,933 --> 01:37:08,972
But one subtle move...

1266
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:12,013
and I'll drop you.

1267
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:15,458
And I'll make sure that your
family knows what you are.

1268
01:37:19,666 --> 01:37:20,933
I understand.

1269
01:37:31,625 --> 01:37:34,210
You come down on the world, Mr. Bafford?

1270
01:37:46,458 --> 01:37:48,666
Take your hand out of your pocket, real slow.

1271
01:37:52,853 --> 01:37:54,210
You don't want to climb over, do you?

1272
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:56,093
What do you do with the key of a cemetery?

1273
01:37:57,791 --> 01:37:58,583
I own it.

1274
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:01,791
Why do you own a cemetery?

1275
01:38:02,171 --> 01:38:05,052
I always want to invest in
things people can't do without.

1276
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:08,171
Water and cemeteries? Pretty save bets.

1277
01:38:13,013 --> 01:38:13,892
Here.

1278
01:38:15,052 --> 01:38:16,416
You'll need this to get out.

1279
01:39:56,583 --> 01:39:58,458
Hey, Atwood!

1280
01:39:59,132 --> 01:40:00,750
I want to show you something.

1281
01:40:24,171 --> 01:40:24,972
Okay.

1282
01:40:27,052 --> 01:40:27,933
Here we are.

1283
01:40:34,052 --> 01:40:34,750
Okay.

1284
01:40:35,583 --> 01:40:39,853
Now if I stand
here and you stand there...

1285
01:40:40,583 --> 01:40:42,458
Not...not too far away.

1286
01:40:43,416 --> 01:40:46,333
And you shoot me, I should...

1287
01:40:47,093 --> 01:40:49,933
I should fall straight
back into this hole.

1288
01:40:52,892 --> 01:40:55,171
You don't think I have
the guts to this, do you?

1289
01:40:56,251 --> 01:40:58,052
No, I'm hoping you do, Mr. Smith,

1290
01:40:58,972 --> 01:41:00,052
I'm hoping you do.

1291
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:04,791
Okay, let's...

1292
01:41:05,892 --> 01:41:07,853
...let's get this over with.

1293
01:41:19,625 --> 01:41:21,052
I'll close my eyes.

1294
01:41:45,583 --> 01:41:47,541
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.

1295
01:41:50,853 --> 01:41:53,375
I really did want you to kill me.

1296
01:41:54,292 --> 01:41:58,171
But in case, the last
minute I changed my mind,

1297
01:41:58,972 --> 01:42:00,933
I returned to your apartment.

1298
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:04,625
And I've been for firing pin on your gun

1299
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:10,500
In fact, I even brought another one for
you to use so you could finish me,

1300
01:42:11,251 --> 01:42:14,052
if I had decided to go through with it.

1301
01:42:15,625 --> 01:42:19,093
Unfortunately for you,
my daughter is pregnant.

1302
01:42:19,791 --> 01:42:22,554
And just before you pulled that trigger

1303
01:42:22,604 --> 01:42:26,583
I realized how much I want to see the end of that story.

1304
01:42:26,683 --> 01:42:28,283
You fuck can't do this to me.

1305
01:42:28,383 --> 01:42:29,644
If you touch even a hair on my head,

1306
01:42:29,793 --> 01:42:31,308
the cops are going to find those pictures.

1307
01:42:31,933 --> 01:42:33,892
And they will know that
you killed that couple.

1308
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:37,812
The contents of your safety
deposit box, Mr. Smith,

1309
01:42:40,933 --> 01:42:42,171
have vanished.

1310
01:42:46,208 --> 01:42:48,000
It hurts, doesn't it?

1311
01:42:49,093 --> 01:42:50,708
No, please!

1312
01:43:14,458 --> 01:43:17,052
Before I was the
thumbprint killer, Mr. Smith,

1313
01:43:18,972 --> 01:43:20,791
I killed a lot of people...

1314
01:43:21,458 --> 01:43:23,375
in a lot of different ways.

1315
01:43:50,175 --> 01:43:51,875
Thank you.

1316
01:43:55,275 --> 01:43:57,275
<i>Detective Atwood credited for tracking
killer in 'Hangman' case </i>

1317
01:43:59,575 --> 01:44:01,575
<i>Hangman Killer case ends in
murder-suicide</i>

1318
01:44:05,013 --> 01:44:07,853
It says there that the
thumbprint killer is a monster.

1319
01:44:09,791 --> 01:44:11,933
Annoying you a little bit, you
can't take credit, doesn't it?

1320
01:44:12,933 --> 01:44:14,333
No.

1321
01:44:15,132 --> 01:44:18,052
Anyone who's good what
they do wants credit.

1322
01:44:18,708 --> 01:44:20,666
Since I'm not going to do it anymore,

1323
01:44:21,251 --> 01:44:24,458
I'll let Mr. Smith have the credit.

1324
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:28,750
Don't kid yourself, Earl.
You are going to kill again.

1325
01:44:29,251 --> 01:44:30,583
No, I am not.

1326
01:44:31,666 --> 01:44:35,458
I'm going back to tha AA
meetings and I will control it.

1327
01:44:45,093 --> 01:44:47,933
But there is an answer
I would like to have.

1328
01:44:51,933 --> 01:44:52,933
Atwood?

1329
01:44:53,052 --> 01:44:54,853
Why you are a cop?

1330
01:44:54,888 --> 01:44:56,292
Who is this?

1331
01:44:56,853 --> 01:44:58,923
You are rich, you have a good education,

1332
01:44:59,673 --> 01:45:01,513
you could have gone into your father's business,

1333
01:45:01,593 --> 01:45:04,917
instead you went outside all of that
and became successful on your own, why?

1334
01:45:05,458 --> 01:45:08,933
If you want something from me then you
have to tell me who you are...

1335
01:45:08,968 --> 01:45:10,257
...or I'm going to hang up.

1336
01:45:10,292 --> 01:45:13,052
Did you think that your
husband's killing was random?

1337
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:16,251
and I certainly didn't
have to give you Meeks.

1338
01:45:16,292 --> 01:45:17,933
Mr. Bafford?

1339
01:45:18,708 --> 01:45:20,171
What is the answer?

1340
01:45:20,625 --> 01:45:22,093
You do not sound like you.

1341
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:27,251
Well, I have a little cold.
Are you going to give me the answer?

1342
01:45:27,933 --> 01:45:29,416
Where are you?

1343
01:45:29,458 --> 01:45:33,251
I'll tell you if you can give
me the true answer to my question.

1344
01:45:44,666 --> 01:45:48,583
My... My father was very
disappointed that I was born a girl.

1345
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:50,251
And he let me know it.

1346
01:45:51,791 --> 01:45:54,333
I spent my whole life
trying to prove him wrong.

1347
01:45:56,853 --> 01:45:58,052
Thank you.

1348
01:45:58,708 --> 01:45:59,417
Wait.

1349
01:45:59,458 --> 01:46:01,708
You... you promised to
tell me where you are?

1350
01:46:02,093 --> 01:46:03,251
Me?

1351
01:46:04,933 --> 01:46:06,972
I am on top of a building.

1352
01:46:12,812 --> 01:46:14,666
That wasn't Bafford.

1353
01:48:40,708 --> 01:48:41,791
<i>Jane! </i>

1354
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:44,500
<i>Jane! </i>

1355
01:48:45,812 --> 01:48:46,972
Wake up, wake up!

1356
01:48:54,625 --> 01:48:55,933
I woke you up?

1357
01:48:56,666 --> 01:48:57,812
It's okay.

1358
01:48:58,513 --> 01:48:59,353
It's okay.

1359
01:49:01,933 --> 01:49:04,052
I'm here. Go back to sleep.

1360
01:49:09,892 --> 01:49:13,132
<i>Why do you fight it so hard, Earl? </i>

1361
01:49:13,790 --> 01:49:16,790
God grant me the serenity to accept
the things that I cannot change.

1362
01:49:17,052 --> 01:49:20,958
Courage to change the things that I can
and wisdom to know the difference.

1363
01:49:21,052 --> 01:49:24,954
Living one day at a time,
enjoying one moment at a time.

1364
01:49:25,592 --> 01:49:27,732
Taking, as He did, this sinful world

1365
01:49:27,892 --> 01:49:29,132
as it is, not as I would have it.

1366
01:49:30,192 --> 01:49:33,832
Trusting that He will make all things
right, If I surrender to His will,

1367
01:49:33,992 --> 01:49:36,332
that I may be reasonably
happy in this life

1368
01:49:36,392 --> 01:49:39,343
and supremely happy with
Him forever in the next.

1369
01:49:39,493 --> 01:49:40,553
Amen.
