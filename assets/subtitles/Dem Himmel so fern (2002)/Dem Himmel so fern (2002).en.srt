2
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,053
Mother! Mother, can I sleep
over at Hutch's tonight?

3
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,063
Mrs. Hutchinson gave permission.

4
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,099
Not tonight, David. Your
father and I are going out,

5
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,101
and I need you to
look after your sister.

6
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,605
Aw, shucks. Now move out of
the way so Mother can park.

7
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:08,448
Sherry Seeger says they only
cost five or six dollars.

8
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,081
Please, Mother. Please, can I?

9
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,422
Oh, Sybil, thank heavens. Well, I
knew you were going to the grocery.

10
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,689
David, please help Sybil unload the car.

11
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,425
How come Janice doesn't
got to? Doesn't have to.

12
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,592
Because Janice is carrying
in all her belongings...

13
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,761
and marching straight
upstairs into a bath.

14
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:27,397
Your father and I have an engagement tonight,
so I want you to have a nice early dinner.

15
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,464
And help Sybil. Yes, ma'am.

16
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,137
Sybil, did Mr. Whitaker call while I
was out? Not since you’ve been gone.

17
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,273
How do you like that guy?
Mother, can I please get them?

18
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:40,376
Janice, I said we'd discuss it with
your father. Now hurry on inside.

19
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,387
David, put your bike away
and help with the groceries.

20
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,855
Where's your jacket? It's inside.

21
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,926
Well, hello, stranger.

22
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,160
Aren't I seeing you in about
three hours' time? You are.

23
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,395
But I just left the caterers
and I had to dash over.

24
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,869
Oh, you have the samples? You bet.

25
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,133
Oh, come inside. You
just caught me actually.

26
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,471
I could only stay a second.
I still have loads to do.

27
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,774
David, what did I tell you?
I'm getting the last bag.

28
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:10,509
And imagine with the
table setting I showed you.

29
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,484
The aqua trim. Is that smart? Oh, yes.

30
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,487
You like? Mm-hmm.

31
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,991
Well, I'll call the caterer in the morning,
you confirm with Dorothy on the deposit...

32
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,992
and, honey, we're in business.

33
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,757
Magnatech '57, here we come. You betcha.

34
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,629
Thanks for stopping by,
El. I'll see you at 8:00.

35
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,498
You know Frank--
on the dot.

36
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,775
Mother? Mm-hmm.

37
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,539
When you were a little girl,
you looked just like me, right?

38
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,603
Mm-hmm.

39
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,276
So, when I grow up, does
that mean I'll look like you?

40
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,616
I s that what you want,
darling, to look like me?

41
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,385
Yes, I hope I look
exactly as pretty as you.

42
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:57,259
What a lovely compliment coming
from my perfectly lovely daughter.

43
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,058
7:15.

44
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,625
Where on Earth is your father?

45
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,034
Sybil, did I leave my
gloves on the hall table?

46
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,141
Yes, I see them.

47
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,701
It's nearly 20 after and Mr.
Whitaker still hasn't phoned?

48
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,681
I'm at my wits' end.
Oh, thank you, Sybil.

49
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,775
I tried phoning the office even
though I knew no one would be there.

50
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:23,720
I certainly hope that's
him, because if it isn't--

51
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,419
Whitaker residence. This is the
Hartford Police Department...

52
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,360
calling for a Mrs. Frank Whitaker.

53
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,092
Who is it? The police department.

54
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,402
Hello?

55
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,564
Yes, am I speaking with a
Mrs. Frank Whitaker? Yes.

56
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,574
One moment, please.

57
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,912
Cathy? Oh, Frank.

58
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,507
Are you all right? What
happened? Everything's fine.

59
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,609
It was all just
a big mix up--

60
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,881
the whole thing.

61
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:59,118
But you have to come get me. They
won’t let me leave on my own.

62
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,889
Oh, Frank, don't worry, darling.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

63
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,260
Is there anything I
can do, Mrs. Whitaker?

64
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:09,267
Just keep an eye on the children,
please. I don't think I'll be very long.

65
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,749
Big time faggot. Family
man. Never can tell.

66
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,753
Say, get a load of this one. You
don't see that every day of the week.

67
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,053
This is your copy,
ma'am, and your receipt.

68
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,063
Thank you.

69
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,069
Oh, Frank.

70
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,570
I tell you
one thing--

71
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,508
if it hadn't been for
that snivelling junior cop,

72
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,707
they would have never gone through
this whole charade in the first place.

73
00:06:55,782 --> 00:07:00,185
Instead of trying to save face-- I saw that
guy that they were after, that loiterer.

74
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,187
But they wouldn’t listen to me.

75
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:11,589
So, there were drinks after work?

76
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:15,691
What do you mean? They said something,
intoxication level, something--

77
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:20,671
Christ, I had one lousy cocktail with
Bill after work going over the portfolio.

78
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,301
Should I be arrested for that
too? No, of course not, darling.

79
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,107
The whole thing has just
put me in a foul state.

80
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,841
He's fine. Oh, the car's fine.

81
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,010
Frank says it was the
bumper that got hit.

82
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,986
But you know me, I can't
tell the difference.

83
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,715
Oh, I'm just sorry we had to miss it.

84
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,996
She was fine.

85
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,295
Said it was all a dreadful
bore, what with Mona Lauder...

86
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,962
and her gossip. Cathy,

87
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,836
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:58,035
Darling, you've nothing to be sorry for.

89
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,136
It was all just a
silly, wretched mistake.

90
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,343
Ohh.

91
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,391
I'm so tired.

92
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,454
Of course you are.

93
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,465
You sleep now.

94
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,458
The bus is here. Have
a good day at school.

95
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,761
Bye.

96
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,001
I thought you were going to
have another piece of toast.

97
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,164
It's late. I should
be getting down there.

98
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,767
Can I at least fix you lunch? No, thank
you, dear. I've got lunch meetings all week.

99
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,778
It's portfolio season.

100
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,781
Sybil, if that’s the milkman,
his check is in the drawer.

101
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,783
I'm just glad you're
feeling better, dear.

102
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,877
Thank you, darling.

103
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,718
Pardon me, ma'am, sir.

104
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,724
Mrs. Whitaker, this is Mrs. Leacock.

105
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,760
She said she had an appointment
with you this morning.

106
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:25,285
Oh, jiminy, I completely forgot
the time. Please forgive me.

107
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,298
I do apologize, Mrs. Whitaker,

108
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,426
but candid views are always the best.

109
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,437
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, dear.

110
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,736
Mrs. Leacock. Pleasure, Mr. Whitaker.

111
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,633
Your husband's a very
charming man, Mrs. Whitaker.

112
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,408
Thank you. We're rather
fond of him ourselves.

113
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,574
Now, please, won’t you come
in? Make yourselves at home.

114
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,584
I suppose I still can't imagine...

115
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:50,110
why you would want an interview with
someone like me in the first place.

116
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,283
Readers of the Weekly
Gazette, Mrs. Whitaker--

117
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,520
women just
like yourself--

118
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,086
with families and homes to keep up.

119
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,098
A good society paper...

120
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,158
need not be a gossip rag.

121
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,260
You are the proud wife...

122
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,967
of a successful sales
executive-- planning the parties,

123
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,477
and posing at her husband’s
side on the advertisements.

124
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,013
To everyone here in Connecticut,

125
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,380
you are Mr. and Mrs. Magnatech.

126
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,385
Thank you. I 'm very flattered.

127
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:25,152
But, really, my life is like
any other wife or mother's.

128
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,921
In fact, I don't think I've,
I've ever wanted anything--

129
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,161
What is it, dear?

130
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,168
I think I just saw someone
walking through our yard.

131
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,404
What on
Earth--

132
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,737
Oh, my-- Mrs. Whitaker, perhaps
you should call the police.

133
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,716
Excuse me.

134
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:56,050
May I help you?

135
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,181
Who are you?

136
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:02,057
I'm sorry, ma'am. My name is
Raymond Deagan-- Otis Deagan's son.

137
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,062
I was just taking
over some of his--

138
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,064
Oh, you're Otis's son.

139
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,066
Yes.

140
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,160
I-I'm terribly sorry for
speaking to you in that manner.

141
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,172
I-I didn't know who was in my yard.

142
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,835
Oh, no need. How is your father?
I know he was in the hospital.

143
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,778
Yes, well,

144
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,780
my father's passed away, I'm afraid.

145
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,074
Oh--

146
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,917
Oh, I-I had no idea.
I'm, I'm so very sorry.

147
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,922
Please, accept our deepest condolences.

148
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,959
Your father was a
wonderful, dedicated man.

149
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,890
Thank you. Mrs. Whitaker?

150
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,523
The caterer's on the
line. Oh, thank you, Sybil.

151
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:44,535
I beg your pardon. Would you excuse
me for just a moment? Of course.

152
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,107
Mrs. Leacock, I'm terribly sorry.

153
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,905
I’ll just be one minute
more. That's fine, dear.

154
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,145
Good morning, Magnatech International?
How may I direct your call?

155
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,155
Good morning, Mr. Whitaker.
Good morning, Kitty.

156
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,157
Lovely dress you're
wearing. Thank you, sir.

157
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,318
Good morning, Marlene, Stan.

158
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,420
Good morning, Mr. Whitaker. How's the
second-best golfer in Hartford this morning?

159
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,431
Somebody break the books already?

160
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,899
Don't tell me our wives'
party budgets finally came in.

161
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,902
It's almost as fatal. Millstein called.

162
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,564
Looks like New York just shaved
a week off portfolio deadline.

163
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,630
You've got to be kidding
me. I wish I were.

164
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,472
What are they trying to
do, strangle us to death?

165
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,910
Does Doug know? Yeah, I
called him first thing.

166
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,877
All right. Get Doug and the others.

167
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,077
Call a portfolio
meeting for lunch today.

168
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,417
Marlene, see if you can reschedule
the production review for dinner.

169
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,322
And, uh, could you get my
wife on the phone, please?

170
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,325
Thanks, Stan.

171
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,641
Mrs. Whitaker is on line one.

172
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,846
Oh, Frank. I'm sorry.

173
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,855
No, no, I understand.

174
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,414
I just wish you wouldn't overwork
yourself, especially after--

175
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,887
I know.

176
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,487
I will.

177
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,760
See you then.

178
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,735
Good-bye, dear.

179
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,898
I'm terribly sorry about
all the interruptions.

180
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,998
Now, where was it you wanted me?

181
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,805
Just one more at the fireplace.

182
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,380
That's it.

183
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,508
Now smile. Isn't that darling?

184
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,985
Hold it.

185
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,063
Well, I guess that about wraps it up.

186
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,069
Bob, Rick. Gentlemen.

187
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,571
You're sure you’re all
right getting home, sir?

188
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,335
Thank you, Davis. But as 2nd in
command of the U.S.S. McMillan,

189
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,639
I do feel equipped to locate
my own car without cover.

190
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,872
Very good, sir. Bright and early.

191
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,316
Sir, can you spare some change, please?

192
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,152
Spare change? Anything would help.

193
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,297
Spare change?

194
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,408
Where ya headed, tiger?

195
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,188
Look out, Jake!

196
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,196
Oh, for heaven's sake.

197
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:02,564
David, that is the third time I've told you
to turn off that infernal racket and go to bed.

198
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,569
Can I please just this once?

199
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,572
No, you certainly may
not, and that is final.

200
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,509
Ah, geez. That is not the kind
of language we use in this house.

201
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,513
Now march.

202
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,345
And don't forget to wash your teeth.

203
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,191
Hi.

204
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,371
Feeling better now?

205
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,982
Mrs. White?

206
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,295
The picture? Yes.

207
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:07,799
I thought you really enjoyed the
scene in the gentlemen's lounge.

208
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,699
How about a drink?

209
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,067
Sure. I know just the spot.

210
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,299
I'll bet you do.

211
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,720
Identification, please.

212
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,625
Huh? Identification--
Driver's license.

213
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,424
Thank you, sir. Have a pleasant evening.

214
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,278
Yes, sir. What can I
get you this evening?

215
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,215
Uh, just a scotch--
neat, please.

216
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,878
Yes, sir.

217
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,666
There you are, sir.

218
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,600
One more of the same.

219
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:20,999
"So, does the fabled maxim hold that behind
every great man there resides a great lady?

220
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:25,867
"In this case, wife, mother
and Mrs. Magnatech herself,

221
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,965
"Cathleen Whitaker proves that it does.

222
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,408
"A woman as devoted to her family...

223
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,639
as she is kind to Negroes."

224
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:38,615
To Negroes? Let me see that. What
on Earth is that woman thinking?

225
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,710
Cathy? Oh, she's been liberal ever since
she played summer stock at college...

226
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,721
with all those steamy Jewish boys.

227
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,723
Why do you think they
used to call her "Red"?

228
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,851
Oh, for heaven sakes. Let's go inside
before Joe McCarthy comes driving by.

229
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,055
- Uh
-oh. Oh, I love that scarf..

230
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,463
Oh, I'm sure it just blew
behind the house somewhere.

231
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,558
For heaven sakes. This
really isn't your day, is it?

232
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,569
No. Did they really call you "Red"?

233
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,071
Oh, Nancy. Honestly!

234
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,870
Would anyone like another daiquiri?

235
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,637
Better not.

236
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,479
Oh, no, one's my limit.

237
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,710
El? Mmm.

238
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:15,879
All right, girls. No more
beating around the bush.

239
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,821
Nancy. Oh,
I-- I can't.

240
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,257
Oh, come on. It can't be that bad.

241
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,385
Um,
well, uh--

242
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,453
Mike
insists on--

243
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,601
He insists on once a week.

244
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,069
- Ah, you got off easy.
- Once a week?

245
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,538
Oh, you're lucky. Ron's
more like two or three.

246
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,541
Three, really? And how.

247
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,907
That's nothing. Girlfriend
of mine-- Shirley Dawson.

248
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,379
Her husband-- every
night of the week.

249
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:47,350
Plus, three more times on the weekend.

250
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,223
Can you imagine?

251
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,199
It was lovely, Cathleen. Thank you. Bye.

252
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,501
Bye, girls. The chicken was divine.

253
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,508
Oh, thanks, El. I'll call you tomorrow.

254
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,510
All right. Bye-bye.

255
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,272
Could this
possibly--

256
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,740
Oh, I'm sorry. No. You found it.

257
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,607
Yeah, I found it hanging off
one of the birches out back.

258
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,612
It was so windy.

259
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,739
I was going back into the house
and it just sailed off my neck.

260
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,943
I had a feeling it might be yours.

261
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:57,079
Who else could have been so
absentminded? No, no, it's the color.

262
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,350
It just seemed right.

263
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,790
Well, thank you, Mr.
Deagan-- for finding it.

264
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,523
Please, call me Raymond.
Thank you, Raymond.

265
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,531
Everything looks
wonderful, by the way. Good.

266
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,763
I think we got everything
pretty much under control.

267
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:16,467
Well, it can't have been easy...
taking over for your father so quickly.

268
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:20,068
Well, between Pop's
business, my, uh, shop...

269
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,136
and taking care of my little girl,

270
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,182
doesn't leave much time for reflecting.

271
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,343
I didn't know you had children.
Just the one-- Sarah's her name.

272
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,320
And how old is Sarah? Eleven.

273
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,323
Well, I'm sure she's a lovely child.

274
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,189
You and your wife must be very proud.

275
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,320
Well, um, Mrs. Deagan, my wife, uh,

276
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,695
passed away when Sarah was about five.

277
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,859
Oh, Raymond, I'm so sorry.

278
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,868
Thank you.

279
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,370
Sarah and I,

280
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,532
we do just fine.

281
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,667
You know, I got a
picture of her somewhere.

282
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,007
There she is. That's my Sarah.

283
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,138
Oh, she's darling.

284
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,876
Look at those eyes.

285
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,975
Now, what's this I hear about a shop?

286
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,955
Oh, yeah, the plant shop. It's just
a little place down on Hawthorn.

287
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,321
Started out as a
service for gardeners...

288
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,361
till I opened the store
about six years ago, and, uh--

289
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:14,092
Well, it's the only thing that
business degree's been good for yet.

290
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,102
Why, that's marvellous, Raymond.
You should be very proud.

291
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,331
Well, I am.

292
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,737
Uh, if you’re ever in the
neighbourhood, be sure to stop by.

293
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:26,141
I certainly will. All right, then.

294
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,771
Thank you. You’re welcome.

295
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,023
If that’s
your father--

296
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,525
Don't worry Sybil, I'll get it.

297
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,665
Hello?

298
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,293
Frank, you haven't left yet?

299
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,702
Oh, no. Not again.

300
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,865
All right.

301
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,875
Good-bye, dear.

302
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,442
He isn't coming home again?
No, he's going to be late.

303
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,449
Father never wants to come home.

304
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:09,510
Janice, he most certainly does. He's just very
busy at work and under a great deal of strain.

305
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,055
Yeah! Shut up.

306
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,819
Janice, that's enough.

307
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,392
Sybil, you know what?

308
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,930
Wrap up Mr. Whitaker's plate. I'm
going to run down to the office...

309
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,932
and take it to him myself.

310
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,969
All the way downtown?
It's not so very far.

311
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,402
Anyway, the children are fine.

312
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:30,999
Knowing Mr. Whitaker, I'm just saving
him another night of pretzels and coffee.

313
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,478
Thank you.

314
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,351
I'm just dropping something off
for my husband on the 12th floor.

315
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,687
Mr. Whitaker. Thank you. All right.

316
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,537
Frank?

317
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,954
Oh, Frank.

318
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,904
Frank?

319
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,355
Cathy.

320
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,664
Mr. Maynard...

321
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,363
Left an estimate for the roof.

322
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,534
I put it in the kitchen.

323
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,645
Twelve hundred
something. Cathy--

324
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,647
I can't.

325
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,979
I
don't--

326
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,763
What?

327
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,725
Eh, you
see, uh--

328
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,664
Once,

329
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,904
a long time ago,

330
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,845
a long, long time ago,

331
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,808
I had, um,

332
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,021
um,
problems--

333
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,125
I just figured
that was--

334
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,356
that was it.

335
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,491
I-I never imagined--
You had problems?

336
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,565
Y-Yes.

337
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,670
You, uh, never
spoke to anyone--

338
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,271
a-a doctor? No.

339
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,540
No one?

340
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,681
I don't understand.

341
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,162
Neither do I.

342
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,933
What if--
I mean,

343
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,870
there must be
people who--

344
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,099
I-I don't know.

345
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,108
Because--

346
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,205
Otherwise, I don't
know what I-- Cathy.

347
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,813
All right.

348
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,232
Thank you.

349
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,621
Mr. and Mrs. Whitaker,
this is Dr. Bowman.

350
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,790
Mr. Whitaker,

351
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,857
how do you do? Hello.

352
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,370
Mrs. Whitaker, how lovely. Thank you.

353
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,770
I suppose we may as well get started.

354
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,741
Actually, uh, Mrs. Whitaker,
I think it might be best...

355
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,903
if your husband and I
conversed in private.

356
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,913
In private. Yes, of course.

357
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,176
I think it would be
best. Certainly, Doctor.

358
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,083
I'll see you later.
I'll see you later, dear.

359
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,895
Today, the general attitude
regarding this sort of behavior...

360
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,297
is naturally more modern,

361
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,633
more scientific than
it ever has been before.

362
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,729
But for those who do seek treatment,

363
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,901
who possess the will and desire...

364
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,910
to lead a normal life,

365
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,538
there still remains only a scant...

366
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:20,243
five to thirty percent
rate of success...

367
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,980
for complete heterosexual conversion.

368
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:25,818
For many, it's the treatment itself...

369
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,688
that often changes the patient's mind.

370
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,990
What does it, uh, comprise of?

371
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:34,190
- The treatment.
- The treatment's comprised of psychiatric sessions...

372
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,426
twice a week, sometimes more.

373
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,435
Just talking? Yes.

374
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,872
Though some patients have explored
additional, more behavioural methods.

375
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,967
- Behavioural?
- Electroshock aversion therapy for instance.

376
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,672
Or hormonal rebalancing procedures.

377
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,909
I know this can all seem
rather daunting at first.

378
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,588
I suggest you take some time.

379
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,646
Think over the various
options we've discussed.

380
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,192
Discuss it with your
wife. No, I already know.

381
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,694
I want to begin treatment.

382
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:11,361
I can't let this thing...

383
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,904
destroy my life,

384
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,906
my family's life.

385
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,377
I, uh-- I-I know
it's a sickness,

386
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,471
because it makes me feel...

387
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,982
despicable.

388
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:31,152
I promise you, Dr. Bowman,
I'm going to beat this thing.

389
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,281
I'm gonna break it.

390
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:35,417
So help me God.

391
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:39,156
Why don't you confirm those
times we discussed with Rosalyn.

392
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,494
I'll see you here same time
next Tuesday. Thank you, Doctor.

393
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,057
Mr. Whitaker, Mrs.
Whitaker. Thank you, Doctor.

394
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,314
Frank? What?

395
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,319
I'm just proud of you, that's all.

396
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,787
Don't say that. Well, I am.

397
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:08,815
He seems a very decent man,
Dr. Bowman. Don’t you think?

398
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,860
Frank? I don't know, Cathleen.

399
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,992
I suppose he's decent.

400
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,633
But you must have liked him
enough to want to see him again.

401
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,642
Who else am I going to see?

402
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,510
Well, I'm sure there are numerous doctors
in Hartford or Springfield if you--

403
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,276
Look, I just want to get the
whole fucking thing over with!

404
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,446
Can you understand that?

405
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:40,287
Frank, please don't.

406
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,658
I-I'm sorry.

407
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,131
All right, Cathy, I'm so sorry.

408
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,589
Good morning, Mr. Whitaker. Morning.

409
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,992
Morning.

410
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,051
Good morning, Mr. Whitaker. Hi, Kitty.

411
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,689
I hope you have a pleasant
day, sir. Thank you.

412
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,699
Good morning, Mr. Whitaker. Marlene.

413
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,702
I found this in the
cupboard, sir. What's that?

414
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,398
Your office lamp-- the
one that was missing.

415
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,998
Ah-- Should I have
it repaired, sir?

416
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,009
Yes. Yes, thank you, Marlene.

417
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,569
Mr. Whitaker, Mr. Fine's been waiting.

418
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,946
Frank? Uh?

419
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,113
I didn't see you sitting there.

420
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,122
Everything all right?

421
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,385
Oh, with me? Of course.

422
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,292
What's up? Just picked up
the galleys from the printer.

423
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,092
How do they look? Great, just great.

424
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:57,396
Just leave them there. I'll
take a look first chance I get.

425
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:00,266
Sure.

426
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,898
You'll let me know what you think?

427
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,169
Of course I will.
You're first on my list.

428
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,636
What's it gonna take to get
you back on that course anyway?

429
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,045
We haven't seen you for weeks. I know.

430
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,640
Sunday. No excuses.

431
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,210
All right. I'll hold you to it.

432
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,489
Thanks again, El. You sure
that's all I can give you?

433
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,462
Oh, yes. The caterer should have everything.
I just thought a few extras would be nice.

434
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,728
Oh, don't forget. The art show is
Saturday. Start working on Frank tonight.

435
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,895
I swear he's the kind of man
you have to pin messages to.

436
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,371
Though I'm sorry to say,
Mona Lauder will be attending.

437
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:40,707
Turns out her uncle's in town, some
hotshot art dealer from New York.

438
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:44,214
I think I met him at
one of Mona's soirees.

439
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,477
A bit flowery for my taste.

440
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,952
How do you mean? Oh, you know,
a touch light on his feet.

441
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,855
Oh, you mean-- Yes,
darling, he's one of those.

442
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,792
Of course, I could be mistaken.
Just an impression I got.

443
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,795
You don't care for them particularly?

444
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,923
Well, no, not particularly.
Not that I actually know any.

445
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:05,696
Call me old-fashioned, I just like
all the men I'm around to be all men.

446
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,034
Say, why the third degree?
It's not the third degree.

447
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,667
I'm just interested,
that's all, in your views.

448
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,233
I read an article in a magazine.

449
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,145
What? Nothing.

450
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,548
I'm just delighted to see you taking
interest in yet another civic cause.

451
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,085
I can see it now.

452
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,920
"Cathleen Whitaker and her
kindness to homosexuals."

453
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,924
Ugh. That word.

454
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:31,393
See you Saturday-- and
bring Frank. I'll try.

455
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:37,663
Then Billy Hutchinson stole
a pass at the ten-yard line.

456
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:41,569
Ran it all the way for a touchdown.
You should a seen it, Pop.

457
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,073
Father, want to see my
routine for the ballet recital?

458
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,305
Hey, I was talking to Pop. Children, give
your father a moment to eat his dinner.

459
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,369
Would you like another lamb chop, dear?

460
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,574
Oh, I'm fine. Are you sure?

461
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,583
I have plenty in the
oven. No, thank you.

462
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,051
I'm, I'm fine.

463
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,851
We're playing Lincoln on Saturday,
Pop-- if you’re not working.

464
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,883
That reminds me. This Saturday is the reception
for the modern art show I told you about,

465
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,929
the one that Eleanor's
group is sponsoring.

466
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,558
Oh, God. I know how you hate these
things, but I simply have to go.

467
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,159
- Eleanor pleaded with me to ask you.
- Wait, what about me?

468
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,534
No one cares one bit
what I'm doing Saturday.

469
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:15,902
David, I'm sorry.

470
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,876
But this Saturday your mother has an
engagement that simply cannot be changed.

471
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,003
Well, Pop could come.

472
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,912
Couldn’t you, Pop? We’ll see, David.

473
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,179
Janice, could you
please pass the butter?

474
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:34,983
Thank you.

475
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:39,420
President Eisenhower was determined
to keep the troops there until--

476
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:42,762
...satisfactory or
unequivocal assurances that--

477
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:46,132
Frank?

478
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,138
Hmm?

479
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,265
Did you see him?

480
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,504
Yeah.

481
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,809
You didn't say a word.

482
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,986
So how did it go with Bowman?

483
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,954
Did you feel--
It was fine.

484
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:10,588
And there's nothing else you care to
share with your very own adoring wife?

485
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:14,358
Cathleen, what I discuss
with this doctor--

486
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:17,401
it's private, all right.

487
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:20,232
- That's part of it.
- Oh, I understand, darling.

488
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,295
I do.

489
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:27,267
Oh-- Frank, wait till you
see the hors d'oeuvres.

490
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,872
The caterer's doing, just
such a marvellous job.

491
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:34,907
I think you’re going to be so
pleased this year, darling. I really do.

492
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,975
Eleanor, darling, I'm so sorry I'm late.

493
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:02,035
Cathleen, darling. Hello, Mona.

494
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:06,482
Uh, I want to introduce you
to my uncle, Morris Farnsworth,

495
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,542
that wickedly successful
Gotham art dealer...

496
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,920
who was kind enough to attend
our provincial little gathering.

497
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,119
Morris, darling, allow
me to introduce you...

498
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,662
to my dear little
friend, Cathleen Whitaker,

499
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,722
whose face and civic fancies
are hardly strangers...

500
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,768
to the society pages of Hartford.

501
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,804
Oh, Mona. Really, you must
ignore her, Mr. Farnsworth.

502
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,170
Charmed. I do hope you enjoy your stay.

503
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,709
Morris was just telling us
the most delightful tale...

504
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,143
all about a forged Rembrandt.

505
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:39,376
Cathy, don't let us keep you. I know you
want to see the show. I am dying to see it.

506
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,476
Oh, yes, dear, simply charming.

507
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,078
Eleanor, you should be
so proud. Thank you, Mona.

508
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,887
It was lovely to meet you, Mr.
Farnsworth. Likewise, my dear.

509
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,873
Wife of Hartford executive...

510
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,671
communing with Picasso?

511
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,406
Mrs. Leacock, it's
lovely to see you again.

512
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,710
And how is that charming
husband of yours?

513
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,376
Oh, he's very well. Thank you.

514
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,679
Um, would you excuse me just a moment?

515
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,689
Oh, certainly, dear. Thank you.

516
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:24,256
Raymond, what a tremendous
surprise finding you here.

517
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,922
Mrs. Whitaker, hello.

518
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,590
Is this your daughter?
Yep, this is my Sarah.

519
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,032
Hello, Sarah. Hello.

520
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:35,095
-Bobby, get over here!
- Say, Sarah,

521
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,403
isn't that Hutch and his little
brother I see playing out front?

522
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,206
You remember them, don’t you, baby?

523
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,212
Oh, sure you do.

524
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,840
The day we went to the Hutchinson house.

525
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,942
Oh, yeah.

526
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:53,388
What do you say you go out and see
if they’d like to play for a while?

527
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,584
Ah, go on.

528
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,593
For Daddy?

529
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,689
Attagirl.

530
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,769
Oh, Raymond, she's lovely. Thank you.

531
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:08,930
Well, how on Earth did you
find out about this show?

532
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,702
Well, I do read the papers.
W-- No, of course you do.

533
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,904
I just meant that it's-- it's
such a-- it's a coincidence.

534
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,913
I know. I was just teasing you.

535
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:21,008
Because, you know, I'm not prejudiced.

536
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,486
My husband and I have always believed
in equal rights for the Negro...

537
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:27,854
and support the N.A.A.C.P.

538
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,859
I'm glad to hear that.

539
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,488
I just wanted you to
know. Well, thank you.

540
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,931
Oh, not at all.

541
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,469
Go!

542
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:43,303
Straighter, Tommy! You
got to throw it straighter.

543
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,810
And hard. One, two, three, go!

544
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,306
It's too heavy..

545
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,283
What? On the back. Your airplane.

546
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:58,219
Who asked you? Come on, Bobby.

547
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,542
So, what's your opinion on modern art?

548
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,737
Uh, it's hard to put into words really.

549
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,247
I-I just know what I care
for, and, and what I don't.

550
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,911
Like this-- I don't
know how to pronounce it.

551
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,887
"Mira"? Miró.

552
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,890
Miró.

553
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,654
I don't know why, but I just adore it.

554
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,093
A feeling it gives.

555
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,791
I know that sounds terribly vague.

556
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:46,735
No, no, actually it confirms something I've
always wondered about modern art, abstract art.

557
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,772
What is that?

558
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,036
That perhaps it's just picking
up where religious art left off,

559
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:55,738
somehow trying to show you divinity.

560
00:41:55,813 --> 00:42:00,182
The modern artist just pares it down to
the basic elements of shape and color.

561
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,185
But when you look at that Miró,

562
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,456
you feel it just the same.

563
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,458
Why, that's lovely, Raymond.

564
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:15,562
T o tell the truth, I've always
preferred the work of the Masters.

565
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,828
Rembrandt,
Michelangelo--

566
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,836
Would you excuse me a
moment? Oh, certainly.

567
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,771
Cathleen-- Oh, El, honey,
everything looks just marvellous.

568
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,707
Cathy, who on Earth is that man? You
have this whole place in a clamour.

569
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,745
For heaven sakes why? Because
of that ridiculous story?

570
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,746
Who is he?

571
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,544
He's Raymond Deagan, Otis Deagan's son.

572
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:38,086
Your gardener? He passed away and
Raymond's taken over his business.

573
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,214
You certainly seem on
familiar terms with him.

574
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,225
Oh, "familiar terms"--
What does that mean?

575
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,888
He happens to have some very
interesting views on Miró.

576
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,955
Oh, jeepers, look at the time. I have to fly.
I'm having the carpets cleaned for tomorrow--

577
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,365
What time are the caterers
showing? They said 4:00.

578
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:54,268
I'll come early, for moral
support. You're a doll.

579
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,925
So glad you could make
it. Come in. Come in.

580
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:30,936
Not to say that I'm against
integration, mind you.

581
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,738
I do believe it's the
Christian thing to do.

582
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,802
But I still say what
happened in Little Rock...

583
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:38,040
could just as easily have
happened here in Hartford.

584
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,174
- Nonsense.
- Well, why is that?

585
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,742
Well, for one thing, there's no
Governor Faubus in Connecticut.

586
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:47,484
But the main reason,
there are no Negroes.

587
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,556
No, but there are some...

588
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,996
rather dangerous pro-integration
types right here in Hartford.

589
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,033
Dangerous? Oh, yes.

590
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,035
Some very attractive ones, in fact,

591
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,970
noted, I'm told, for
their kindness to Negroes.

592
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,701
Oh, Dick, stop. Where on
Earth did you hear about that?

593
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,709
Shirley read it to me.
I should have known.

594
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,473
- What's all this?
- Absolutely nothing.

595
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:12,379
Now, let me freshen those.

596
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,350
Excuse me, please. Thanks.

597
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:22,252
Oh, by golly, there she is now,
the "purist" gal in the room.

598
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,955
Oh, Stan, liquor brings out the Texan
in you. I hope Eleanor isn't listening.

599
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:30,296
So what if she is. I still say
Frank is the luckiest guy in town.

600
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,768
Hear! Hear! It's all smoke and
mirrors, fells. That's all it is.

601
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,101
You should see her without her face on.

602
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:41,669
- Frank!
-No, he's absolutely right.

603
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:45,203
We ladies are never what we appear,
and every girl as her secrets.

604
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:48,911
I'll say. How about this girl
getting her husband another drink?

605
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,920
Darling, don’t you think
you've already had enough?

606
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,115
No, I don't think
I've had enough--

607
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,684
I'd just like to take a moment to raise a
glass to our marvellous host and hostess...

608
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:02,095
and another glorious annual
party at the Whitakers.

609
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:05,897
To Frank and Cathy, truly
Mr. and Mrs. Magnatech.

610
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,233
Hear! Hear!

611
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,569
My goodness. Thank you very much.

612
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,007
Now, who can I freshen
up? Ron? No, I'm fine.

613
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:16,808
Me. Oh, I think you’re fresh enough.

614
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,871
All right.

615
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,042
Here, Mrs. Whitaker,
let me take that for you.

616
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,052
Thank you, Sybil.

617
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,418
Cathy? Hi.

618
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,957
Honey, is everything all right?

619
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,959
Why? What do you mean?

620
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,995
Frank-- I've never
seen him so soused.

621
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,725
Oh, he's been working so hard
lately. He's under tremendous strain.

622
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,733
You sure that's all? Oh, yes.

623
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:41,134
You'd tell me if there was
anything more? Of course I would.

624
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,638
Well, Cathy,

625
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:46,536
I think we just threw ourselves one class
-"A" swanky function.

626
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,942
It did turn out nicely, didn't it?

627
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:52,812
Cathleen, darling, you've simply
outdone yourself once again.

628
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,817
Thank you so much.

629
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,251
Frank?

630
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,096
Well, if I do say so myself,
it was a lovely party,

631
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,138
all considering.

632
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:27,680
I just wish...

633
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:31,050
it didn't have to turn ugly...

634
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,988
in front of our friends.

635
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:38,223
Honestly, Frank, if
you didn't insist on--

636
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,289
What is it?

637
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,305
Oh, Frank.

638
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,895
Oh, Jesus.

639
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:23,167
Oh, Jesus! What's
happening? I can't even--

640
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,174
God! Frank, it doesn't matter.

641
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,370
The important thing is to
keep, to keep trying. Don't!

642
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,640
What?
Because--

643
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,710
I'm sure, you know,

644
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:39,517
Dick Dawson wouldn't mind lending
his services every once in a while.

645
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,115
Oh, Frank.

646
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,626
I mean, you wouldn't mind
that so much, would you?

647
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,459
A good-looking guy like Dick.

648
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,465
Maybe even Stan would pitch in.

649
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,627
Frank, you're the only
man that I've ever wanted.

650
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,898
Just let go. Frank,
Frank, you're--

651
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:56,906
You're all men to me. You're all man.

652
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,908
Stop it!

653
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:03,704
Cathy. Cathy, I'm sorry. Oh.
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.

654
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,305
It's all right. I'm-I'm all right.

655
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,851
It was an accident. Are you bleeding?

656
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:12,548
Oh, just--just
the littlest bit.

657
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:17,219
Perhaps, um, you could
get me some ice, dear.

658
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:20,320
Some ice? Yes.

659
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,662
Cathy--
I-I know.

660
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,193
Uh, um, it's all right. I'm all right.

661
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:12,475
Hey, there, hon. Listen. I can't stay.
I'm meeting Stan for lunch at the club.

662
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:15,882
Oh, that sounds like fun. Can't believe
I let you get away without these.

663
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,944
It's cute, your hair that way. Oh, yeah?

664
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,955
I experimented. Oh, it's adorable.

665
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:21,957
Thanks. Oh. Whoopsie.

666
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,429
Thanks.

667
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,562
Cathy. What?

668
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,068
What happened to your head?

669
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,728
Oh, nothing. I--
I hit the door.

670
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,069
It was the silliest thing.

671
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,799
Cathy. What?

672
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,178
Did something happen
between you and Frank?

673
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,237
What do you mean?

674
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,876
Cathy, I'm your best friend.

675
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,978
Nothing happened.

676
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:54,285
Nothing at all.

677
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:59,153
Oh, Cathy.

678
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,490
Eleanor.

679
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:12,837
Cathy, I'm your dearest and
closest friend in the world.

680
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,942
You call me--
day or night.

681
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,775
You hear?

682
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,477
Mrs. Whitaker?

683
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,324
Is there anything I can do?

684
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:16,196
You sure?
I'm-- I'm fine.

685
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,935
I just,
um--

686
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:22,035
I-It's a difficult
time with my husband.

687
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:25,343
Oh. It happens with married people.

688
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,942
I know it does. I’m just--
It’s just embarrassing.

689
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,420
Please forgive me. Forgive you?

690
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,952
Mrs. Whitaker, listen.

691
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,591
I have to pick up some shrubs
from a farmhouse just out of town.

692
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,965
Which means I gotta get a move on.

693
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,967
Why don't you come along for the ride?

694
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,475
Some fresh air, change of scenery...

695
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,807
might help you take your mind of things.

696
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:58,143
Ooh. Oh,
no. I, uh--

697
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,115
I couldn't.
Uh--

698
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,749
Thank you, Raymond, for offering.

699
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,756
You're very kind.

700
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:09,985
You sure? Mrs. Whitaker?

701
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,587
Oh. Yes, Sybil? It's
Mrs. Barker on the phone.

702
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:17,258
I'll be right there! Oh.

703
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,825
Mm. I have to get back.

704
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:22,497
Okay.

705
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:35,814
Oh, not at all. Um, well, I-- I was
planning on picking them up at 5:00.

706
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,446
You'd like to switch for Thursday?

707
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,958
I don't see why that would be a problem.

708
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:46,621
Um, No. I'm glad I could be of help.

709
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,789
Certainly.

710
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,856
Bye now.

711
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:11,314
Raymond. Mrs. Whitaker.

712
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:14,186
Hi. Hello.

713
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:18,819
Oh, wouldn’t you know it. I just received
a call and suddenly everything's changed.

714
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,829
Anyway,
I--

715
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:24,162
You changed your mind.

716
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:26,168
Well, good.

717
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,413
Thank you very much,
Mr. Deagan. Thank you.

718
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,407
Oh, it's lovely. What is it?

719
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:13,745
Hamamelis-- well, flowering witch
hazel. Fairly rare in these parts.

720
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:15,751
It's beautiful.

721
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,720
You were right. What a
perfectly lovely spot.

722
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,750
Is that a path?

723
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,760
I think so.

724
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:27,763
Let's have a peek. All right.

725
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:38,269
Sometimes it's the people
outside our world...

726
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:41,105
we confide in best.

727
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:44,613
But once you do...
confide, share with someone,

728
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,945
they're no longer
really outside, are they?

729
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,011
Oh. Look!

730
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,214
How lovely.

731
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,632
Did he cause that?

732
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,809
He didn't mean to strike me.

733
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,676
I am so sorry.

734
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:25,312
No. Heaven knows we
all have our troubles.

735
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:27,583
I'm sure you,
yourself--

736
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,457
What?

737
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:37,092
I don't know. Ever since running
into you at the exhibition,

738
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,998
I kept wondering what it must be like...

739
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,469
to be the only one in a room.

740
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,673
Colored or...

741
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:46,675
whatever it was.

742
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:49,337
How that might possibly feel.

743
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:52,677
I'm sure I've--
I've never--

744
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,951
Well,

745
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,955
I suppose you sort of grow
accustomed to it over time.

746
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,957
I mean, don't get me wrong.

747
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,358
There is a world, even here in Hartford,

748
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,896
where everybody does
indeed look like me.

749
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:12,464
Trouble is, very few people
ever leave that world.

750
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:17,830
I only want what every
father wants for his child.

751
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,899
The opportunities growing
up I never had. Naturally.

752
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:24,743
But I tell you something. If
you’re really interested-- Oh, I am.

753
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,713
You hungry? I mean,
could you eat something?

754
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:32,580
I suppose I could. Tell you what,

755
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:35,351
I'm gonna take you to
one of my favourite spots.

756
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,450
On good days, it's got
hot food, cold drink,

757
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:39,461
and just about discernable music.

758
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:42,225
It's hard to beat that. There you go.

759
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,602
Say, who's green Edsel? Yoo-hoo.

760
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,613
Yoo-hoo. Here I am.

761
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:01,206
Oh. There you are, ma'am.

762
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,275
Let me get that for you.

763
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:24,504
Oh. Thank you very much indeed.

764
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:27,065
Thank you, ma'am.

765
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:30,374
Oh, my God.

766
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:37,412
Let me help you with that,
ma'am. Oh. Thanks very much.

767
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:40,923
Blues ]

768
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,754
Thank you. I'm hardly
dressed for a restaurant.

769
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,818
You look fine.

770
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,772
Raymond. Don't worry.

771
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,001
This is a very friendly place.

772
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:03,070
Say there, Esther.

773
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,273
What, you can't say hello anymore?

774
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,442
Looks like you speakin'
just fine for yourself.

775
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:12,113
Oh, now you just sore because I haven't
been coming around like I used to.

776
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:14,816
Is that so? Mm-hmm.

777
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,382
Now what do you say about bringing
us over a couple of drinks?

778
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,361
What would you like? Oh,
uh, a daiquiri if they--

779
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,864
One daiquiri and a bourbon on the rocks.

780
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:24,957
Thank you, doll.

781
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:32,636
What do you think you're doing, boy?

782
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,438
Thank you.

783
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:49,990
Well, I hope you’re
finding this very amusing.

784
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:54,594
What do you mean? This
is a very welcoming place.

785
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:59,464
How you doing', Gus?

786
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,130
See what I mean?

787
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:07,432
Thank you.

788
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:13,181
Thank you, Esther.

789
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,586
Here's to being the only one.

790
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,655
You know, we don't have to stay here.

791
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,857
If you feel uncomfortable-- No.
As long as I stay away from Esther,

792
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:31,867
I think I'll be fine.

793
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:34,563
All right then.

794
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,969
«

795
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,241
Thank you, Raymond,

796
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,187
for a lovely afternoon.

797
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,917
No. Thank you, Mrs. Whitaker.

798
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:01,589
I've had one as well.

799
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:04,132
Mrs. Whitaker sounds
so formal. Would you--

800
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:07,303
Would I what?

801
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,339
Ask me to dance?

802
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:38,190
«

803
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,448
Oh. That looks
wonderful. Now, let's see.

804
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,152
Where should we put it?
Oh. I know. Right there.

805
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:39,956
Right by the window.

806
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,020
Yes.

807
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:45,465
Yes. That's lovely. It certainly is.

808
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,470
Oh. Now, let's see.
Where did I put that list?

809
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:52,304
Although I promised Janice that I
wouldn't be late for her recital.

810
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,036
Can't miss that.

811
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:58,305
Sybil, I've been meaning
to ask you-- Yes, ma'am?

812
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,316
What's the name of that
church group you belong to?

813
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,581
The one you mentioned to
me. You mean, at Ebenezer?

814
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,918
The Baptist group? Yes.
I believe that's it.

815
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:10,425
Or was it South Green Baptist during
the fair drive, the Ladies Auxiliary?

816
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:12,427
Oh. I didn't know
there was more than one.

817
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,759
Yes. I always seem to be
signing up for something.

818
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:18,995
I think that's marvellous, Sybil, that
you find the time with all you do for us.

819
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:22,936
I just have so much in the attic
I've been meaning to go through.

820
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:25,599
I thought you might know of a
church or civic organization...

821
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,609
that could use a donation.

822
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:30,441
Well, certainly, Mrs. Whitaker, if
that’s what you’re looking for.

823
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:34,347
Places in need are never hard
to find. I'm sure you’re right.

824
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:39,787
Oh! My. Hello. May I help you?

825
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,552
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Allow me to introduce myself.

826
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:46,186
My name's Reginald Carter
and this is Martha Livingston.

827
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,196
We're members of the Hartford Branch...

828
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:51,631
of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People.

829
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:54,761
Oh, well, certainly, I am
familiar with your organization.

830
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:57,863
Perhaps you'd be interested in reading
over our complimentary brochure.

831
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,034
Mm. Yes. I would. If you
wouldn't mind signing our roster--

832
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,772
I'm running so terribly late as it is.

833
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:05,905
Sybil, would you mind
signing for me? Yes, ma'am.

834
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,973
Thank you.

835
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,937
«

836
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:20,417
Mother! Hello, dear.

837
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:24,357
- Did the recital just begin?
- Shh!

838
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:27,988
So where are the other
little girls from your class?

839
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:31,324
Over there.

840
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,788
Janice. Janice!

841
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:06,628
Sybil?

01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,009
Hello. Cathy?

843
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:18,342
El? Oh, Cathy. Thank heavens you're
home. I've been trying you all day.

844
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,349
El, what is it? So you haven't
heard? You haven't heard a thing?

845
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:25,410
No. What happened? Oh, Cathy.
There's been talk. Vicious talk.

846
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,752
What do you mean? About what? About you?

847
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:31,919
Oh, for heaven sake. What
now? Honey. It's Mona, Cathy.

848
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:35,020
She's-- Well, she's just
been on some kind of rampage,

849
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:40,592
swearing up and down that she saw you and
a colored man somewhere out on Franklin.

850
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,104
Getting out of a truck
or some such thing.

851
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:46,107
The same colored man she claims
you were talking to at the art show.

852
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,109
Eleanor, that's--
that's preposterous.

853
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:51,943
I mean, yes, I've spoken to Mr. Deagan on
occasion, but this makes it sound like--

854
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:54,608
I know. You have no idea what
it's been like around here.

855
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:57,278
The phone has been ringing off
the hook since 8:00 this morning.

856
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:01,653
- Eleanor, the entire situation is so absurd.
- Darling, I know.

857
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,658
What in the world am I supposed to do?

858
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:06,388
I suppose you could start by
getting yourself another gardener.

859
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:10,398
Frank? What on Earth-- Eleanor, could
I call you back? Frank just walked in.

860
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,730
Of course. You go ahead.
I'll call you later.

861
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,397
Frank?

862
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,406
What are you doing home?
Is everything all right?

863
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:21,238
Just tell me one goddamned thing. What?

864
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,938
Is it true, what they've been saying?

865
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:25,947
Frank, I can't
believe you even--

866
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:29,917
Because if it is, even in the
slightest, I swear to God, Cathleen--

867
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,750
Frank, I am sorry you even
had to hear such nonsense.

868
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,484
Yeah, well, Dick Dawson didn't seem
to think it was such nonsense...

869
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,583
when he snuck away from
his desk to phone me today.

870
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,787
Good heavens. He says the
whole friggin' town's talking!

871
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,796
Frank, please. Sybil will hear you.

872
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,798
I sent her out!

873
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:48,599
Christ, Cathleen, do you even have the
slightest idea about what this could mean?

874
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,265
Don’t you realize the
effect it's gonna have on me...

875
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,776
and the reputation I have spent the
past eight years trying to build...

876
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,176
for you and the children
and for the company?

877
01:06:57,246 --> 01:07:00,272
Frank, I swear to you, whatever
Mona Lauder saw or thought she saw...

878
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:03,045
was entirely a figment of that
woman's hateful imagination.

879
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,883
Yes. I have spoken to
Raymond Deagan on occasion.

880
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:09,391
He brought his little girl to Eleanor's
art show. But-- But, apparently,

881
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:14,828
even here in Hartford, the idea of a white
woman even speaking to a colored man--

882
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,831
Oh, please! Just save
me the Negro rights!

883
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:19,459
You know what that woman is capable of!.

884
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:23,062
And besides, I-I've
already given him notice...

885
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:27,303
and we-- we won't be
seeing that man again.

886
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,509
Fine.

887
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:46,488
Is that why you came home--
because of what Dick said?

888
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,395
Did something happen at work?

889
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:03,274
Frank.

890
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:10,885
Tsk. I guess you could call it
some sort of early Christmas bonus.

891
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:12,887
What do you mean?

892
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,287
A month of rest and relaxation.

893
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:21,760
Can you imagine? During the
busiest season of the year.

894
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,958
What a goddamn honour.

895
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:28,901
But when you consider the
bang-up job I've been doing...

896
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:32,566
ever since good ol' Dr.
Bowman came on the scene--

897
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:35,838
and for being-- What
did Millstein call it?

898
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:38,903
"Years overdue."

899
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:42,917
They do owe you a vacation
after all you've given them.

900
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:47,422
Palm Springs is supposed to be nice.

901
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,720
So says the word on high.

902
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,528
I know it may not seem like it now,

903
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:57,191
but a little time away, a vacation,

904
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,928
might be the best thing...

905
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:02,027
for both of us.

906
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,275
Frank, what a wretched day
it must have been for you.

907
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:12,041
Say, what do you know? Pop's
home. What you doing' home, Pop?

908
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,048
David, your father has work to do.

909
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:17,882
It's best you help yourself to a glass
of milk and get started on your studies.

910
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:21,548
Yes, Mother. Say, Pop--
Mind your mother, David.

911
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,615
Yes, sir.

912
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:41,242
Uh, say, Mr.
Deagan-- Yes, Jake?

913
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,972
There's a lady on the phone
for you. I'll be right there.

914
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,924
- Hello.
- Hello.

915
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,426
Thank you for meeting me. I
realize you have a busy schedule.

916
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:10,131
Worked out fine. I was glad you called.

917
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:13,241
Are you sure everything's all right?

918
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,843
Uh, is there something
I can do for you folks?

919
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:22,844
Can we leave here? Of course.

920
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:40,596
What is it? What happened?

921
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:44,568
I wanted to see you
in person, Raymond. I--

922
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,973
I just--
I can't.

923
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,705
Can't what?

924
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,247
It isn't plausible for
me to be friends with you.

925
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:59,916
You've been so very kind to me and I've been
perfectly reckless and foolish in return,

926
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:03,083
thinking--
Thinking what?

927
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:05,922
That one person could
reach out to another,

928
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:08,589
take an interest in another...

929
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:10,291
and maybe for one fleeting instant...

930
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:13,995
could manage to see beyond the surface,

931
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:16,663
beyond the color of things?

932
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:19,606
Do you think we ever really do...

933
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:22,143
see beyond
those things--

934
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,145
the surface of things?

935
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:29,878
"Just beyond the fall of grace,

936
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,852
behold that ever-shining place."

937
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:38,019
Yes. I do.

938
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:42,221
I don't really have a choice.

939
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:48,328
I wish I could.

940
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,506
Good luck to you, Raymond.

941
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,605
Mrs. Whitaker. You! Boy!

942
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,575
Hands off!.

943
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:10,019
- Yeah! You!
- Raymond, please don't.

944
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:19,033
You're so beautiful.

945
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:34,279
Come on, dear.

946
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,633
Oh! It is them! It is!

947
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,637
Thank you, Mother. Thank you, Father.

948
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,696
Mwah!

949
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:03,576
Oh-ho. Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

950
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,239
Now I'll be as good as all
the other girls in class.

951
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,579
Here you are, darling.

952
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,745
Just the way you like it. Ahh.

953
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,914
Hey, Pop. Look at this steam engine.

954
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,584
Wonderful. Oh. My goodness.

955
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:19,991
I knew I was forgetting something.

956
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:24,721
A little something
for Mr. and Mrs. Claus.

957
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,997
Well, what have we here?

958
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,875
"Bermuda."

959
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:38,845
"Acapulco. Rio.

960
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,542
Miami." Take your
pick. It's your choice.

961
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,380
Mother, will you help
me lace up my slippers?

962
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:47,617
In a minute, dear. I don't know.
Stan is always raving about Miami.

963
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:51,284
Oh, Frank. Miami would be a dream.

964
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,796
El says it's just
darling. Everything's pink.

965
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:57,127
Oh, really? Hmm.

966
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,396
Maybe we oughta consider Bermuda.

967
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,835
Oh, Frank! I do love you, darling.

968
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:04,839
Mwah. I do.

969
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:06,431
«

970
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:32,863
I must say, you look
extremely fetching...

971
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,267
all gussied up in
your white tux and tie.

972
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:37,771
Well, it's a good thing, since
I can hardly breathe in it.

973
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,001
Oh. It's not that bad.

974
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:44,442
You like my dress? Why, yes.

975
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:46,447
Very much. Didn't I say?

976
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:51,282
You did not. Well, it's
a ravishing dress...

977
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:53,617
with a ravishing girl to go with it.

978
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,782
That's more like it.

979
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:01,662
Very nice.

980
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,791
Right this way, sir.
Hilda, we're over here.

981
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:11,967
Ah. Excuse us. No problem at all.

982
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,168
«

983
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:20,909
You have a lovely family. Thank you.

984
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:23,315
Have a Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

985
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,788
Oh, Kenny, be a darling and
pour the champagne. Sure, Mother.

986
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,983
Ladies and gentlemen,
the time has come...

987
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:32,788
for the countdown into the new year.

988
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:34,795
Must be almost time. All together now!

989
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,832
Five, four, three,

990
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,891
two, one.

991
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:42,163
Happy New Year!

992
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:44,330
Happy New Year, darling. «

993
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:47,999
Happy New Year to you.

994
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,046
- Where do you wanna go?
- Mm. The table.

995
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:03,887
All right. Mary. Did you see Kenny?

996
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:08,555
Martin! Martin!

997
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,155
Martin!

998
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,167
Oh! Caroline.

999
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,363
You know you’re not
supposed to go in there!

1000
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:19,236
Now what did I tell you
about going in that pool?

1001
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:22,141
You know you're not
supposed to go in there!

1002
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,509
Donna!

1003
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,383
- Hello there.
- Well, hello.

1004
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:36,920
Nice swim, darling? Ahh.

1005
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:39,722
Isn't the sun just marvellous? Mm-hmm.

1006
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:42,355
Donna. Time to get out. What? But why?

1007
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,763
Because I said so.

1008
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:00,273
- Here comes Kenny.
- I was looking for you on the other side.

1009
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:02,283
I tell you, we're gonna
have to start meeting points.

1010
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:06,549
That does it. I've had quite enough
fashion advice for the afternoon.

1011
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,886
I do believe it's time
for my Miss Mitchell.

1012
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:14,159
Oh, heavens. What?

1013
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:18,290
I think I left it upstairs. So
silly. You want me to go get it?

1014
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:21,097
No. You just sat down.
Oh, no. I don't mind.

1015
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:24,161
You sure? Yeah. I have
to get a paper anyway.

1016
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:27,072
Thank you, darling.

1017
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:29,474
I think it's right
there on the nightstand.

1018
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:42,349
Hey, Hutch. Look. What?

1019
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,921
Hey, fellas!

1020
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:55,622
Look who's coming. It's daddy's girl.

1021
01:18:56,998 --> 01:19:00,434
Hey there, daddy's girl. Where
do you think you're going?

1022
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:03,198
Home. Home to see your daddy?

1023
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:06,468
Yeah. And his white girlfriend.

1024
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,532
Hey! Where you going?

1025
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,601
We just wanna play.

1026
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:38,306
Uh-oh. Wrong turn, daddy's girl.

1027
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,739
Hey, daddy's girl. Over here.

1028
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:45,644
Yeah. She made a wrong turn
all right. Just like her daddy.

1029
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:12,431
They're here! I see
their car! They're here!

1030
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:17,277
Welcome home, Mr. and Mrs.
Whitaker. Oh, my goodness.

1031
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:20,280
What a lovely greeting.
Hiya, Pop. Hey, Mother.

1032
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:22,282
Hey. So, Mother, was it dreamy?

1033
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,284
Oh-ho. Listen to you. "Dreamy."

1034
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:27,788
Did you have a nice time, Mr.
Whitaker? Yes. It was very relaxing.

1035
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:30,950
Say, Pop-- David, help Sybil
with the luggage please.

1036
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:34,655
Pop, you'll never guess what
happened at school this week.

1037
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:37,254
Try and guess. David. Uh, I give up.

1038
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,800
I'm helping, Mother. Billy
Hutchinson and these two other boys...

1039
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,802
all got expelled from school.

1040
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:45,465
I think you mean "suspended."
No. Expelled. I swear.

1041
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:49,101
For throwing a rock at a
girl's head. That's terrible.

1042
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:52,977
- A little girl at school?
- No. She was a Negro.

1043
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:55,482
What? Who told you such
a thing? Tommy Hawkins.

1044
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,041
He saw it, so he had
to tell the principal.

1045
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:02,413
Sybil, is this true? Yes,
ma'am. I'm afraid it is.

1046
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:05,186
What on Earth has gotten into this town?

1047
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,353
It was just a couple of foolish kids.

1048
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:10,694
Yeah. Hutch said that they were
just trying to teach her a lesson.

1049
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:14,861
Well, I think it's dreadful, and you're not to
play with that Hutch boy again, understand me?

1050
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:17,769
-Yes, ma'am.
- David, while you’re up,

1051
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:19,932
how about flippin'on
the set for your old man?

1052
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:21,999
Sure, Pop.

1053
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:43,459
- Mother, how do you spell "skirt"?
- Uh, just a minute, dear.

1054
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:45,624
Mother's making a call.

1055
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:55,204
Oh. Yes. Hello. Um, I was wondering
if you could help me possibly.

1056
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:57,211
I just received your brochure,

1057
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:59,213
which I found extremely informative,

1058
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:03,081
and I was curious about what was
entailed, precisely, in your--

1059
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:07,417
in your volunteer program in terms
of particular skills and so on.

1060
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,923
You see,
I-- Oh.

1061
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,925
Oh, yes. I can hold.

1062
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:13,984
Father's home.

1063
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:20,264
Frank. What happened to the match?

1064
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:23,429
Oh, my, um, shoulder.
It started acting up.

1065
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:25,336
I-- I just couldn't
sit there any longer.

1066
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:29,138
You didn't say anything. Father,
I did the splits today. Wanna see?

1067
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:32,771
Janice, your father just
walked in the door...

1068
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:34,781
and you have schoolwork to finish.

1069
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:37,340
Yes, Mother.

1070
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:40,388
You know, Frank, you
never had that physical.

1071
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,946
And I think you're due for
one. Can I call Dr. Ellis?

1072
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:45,458
You know, it's been three years.

1073
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:49,088
Oh. Did I tell you that the paediatrician
thinks that Janice is going to need braces?

1074
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:52,327
Father, do I have to? Apparently,
our little girl has an overbite.

1075
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,563
Pop, you'll never guess what
I'm doing. Where is your coat?

1076
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:59,300
It's in the garage. I'm waxing
Pop's car. And what's it doing there?

1077
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:01,069
It's gonna look swell, Pop.

1078
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:04,077
How many times do I have to tell you
children you are not permitted outdoors...

1079
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,170
in this kind of weather unless
you are properly dressed?

1080
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,181
Yes, ma'am. Because I give up.

1081
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:10,945
If you wanna go and catch your
death of cold, then so be it.

1082
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:14,011
You try talking some sense into them,
Frank, because whatever I say doesn't--

1083
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:21,660
Frank?

1084
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:26,098
What's the matter?

1085
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:31,171
God.

1086
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:33,332
David, Janice, go
upstairs to your rooms.

1087
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:35,342
Now.

1088
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:40,379
Now!

1089
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,280
Frank.

1090
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:50,188
What is it?

1091
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:56,463
Cathy,

1092
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,624
something's happened.

1093
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,793
What?

1094
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:10,043
I've fallen in love with someone...

1095
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:14,474
who wants to be with me.

1096
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:19,382
Oh, Cathy,

1097
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:26,250
I-I-I
just-- I--

1098
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:29,160
I never knew
what that felt--

1099
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:32,657
But I know that
sounds so cruel, but--

1100
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:35,532
Oh, God. Cathy, I tried.

1101
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:39,869
I tried so hard to make it go away.

1102
01:24:39,941 --> 01:24:42,933
It-- It-- I thought
that I could do it...

1103
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:45,946
for you and for the kids.

1104
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:49,108
But... I can't.

1105
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,118
I just--
I can't.

1106
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:54,178
I can't.

1107
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,956
I, um, assume then, you'll be...

1108
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:08,934
wanting a divorce.

1109
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:16,200
Cathy.

1110
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:51,275
Eleanor.

1111
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:53,678
Eleanor, it's me, Cathy.

1112
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,155
Oh, Cathy.

1113
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:10,163
So you see, El,

1114
01:26:10,231 --> 01:26:13,689
why I couldn't tell you
anything-- anything at all.

1115
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:15,895
Oh, you dear sweet kid.

1116
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:20,304
In a million years, I couldn't
have imagined. Not Frank.

1117
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:25,938
I think that's what's
been hardest of all.

1118
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,948
The endless secrecy.

1119
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:31,417
Our entire lives just shut in the dark.

1120
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:33,852
Are there savings? None to speak of.

1121
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:36,413
Certainly not with
Frank's job on the line.

1122
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:39,517
Well, honey, if there’s anything
you need, anything at all--

1123
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:43,052
Oh, El. I mean it.
We're here, all right?

1124
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:46,759
Thank you, El,

1125
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:48,893
for always having been.

1126
01:26:56,477 --> 01:26:59,275
You know, it's funny. What's that?

1127
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:04,876
This whole time, the only person I was
able to talk to about any of this...

1128
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:06,978
was Raymond Deagan.

1129
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,046
- What?
- It's true.

1130
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:11,819
Not in the way that Mona
intended. Nothing like that.

1131
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,418
But we would just talk.

1132
01:27:15,964 --> 01:27:19,161
And somehow, it
made me feel--

1133
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,293
I don't know.

1134
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:23,462
Alive somewhere.

1135
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:28,069
Eleanor, I know it's ridiculous and mad,

1136
01:27:28,142 --> 01:27:31,578
but I-- I
think of him.

1137
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:34,513
I do.

1138
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:36,914
What he's doing. What he's thinking.

1139
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:39,749
I--

1140
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,812
I do.

1141
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:52,966
El? What can I say?

1142
01:27:53,034 --> 01:27:55,969
You're so full of
surprises, I'm speechless.

1143
01:27:56,037 --> 01:28:00,030
What do you mean? I'm sure I
must've looked entirely the fool...

1144
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:03,874
crusading away against Mona Lauder
and all her so-called inventions.

1145
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:06,209
Eleanor, how could you say such a thing?

1146
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,215
I didn't say a word.

1147
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:11,810
Who am I to tell anyone
how to lead their lives?

1148
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:14,719
Eleanor, nothing happened
between us. I told you that.

1149
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:17,553
Cathy, it's none of my business,

1150
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,923
but you certainly make it
sound as if something had.

1151
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:48,483
Mrs. Whitaker? Oh. Sybil.

1152
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:51,423
I'm sorry to disturb
you, ma'am. I-I just--

1153
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:54,290
Yes, Sybil?

1154
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:58,093
There's something I've been wanting
to tell you, ma'am, for some time.

1155
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:02,694
Something I believe you surely Anna
know, even if it isn't exactly my place.

1156
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:06,035
Well, what is it? It's about
the little colored girl, ma'am.

1157
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:08,371
The one that got hit. Yes.

1158
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:10,377
What about her?

1159
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:14,211
I'm sorry, ma'am. It was Mr.
Deagan's little girl, Sarah.

1160
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:16,773
What? Oh, Sybil. No.

1161
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:20,480
The neighbours tell me she's doing just
fine. Oh, that poor sweet little girl.

1162
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:24,548
That-- How in God's name could you not
have told me, Sybil? This was weeks ago!

1163
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:27,321
Mrs. Whitaker, please
don't be cross with me.

1164
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:29,329
I didn't wanna make things any worse.

1165
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:31,888
Sybil, do you know
where Mr. Deagan lives?

1166
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:35,561
I believe he's been at his father's
old place on 12th and Governor.

1167
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:37,570
Twelfth and Governor. Thank you.

1168
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:39,572
Are you going there now?

1169
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:42,074
Please keep an eye on the
children. I shouldn't be too long.

1170
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:44,168
Mrs. Whitaker. What?

1171
01:29:44,245 --> 01:29:46,406
Would you like me to go with you, ma'am?

1172
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:48,972
No. No, I'll be fine. Thankyou, Sybil.

1173
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:03,152
Who on Earth?

1174
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,536
Yes. Raymond, I-- I just
heard. Just this instant.

1175
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:11,595
I heard and I jumped into my car.

1176
01:30:11,672 --> 01:30:14,539
How are you? How is Sarah?

1177
01:30:15,676 --> 01:30:19,009
We're fine. Thank you.

1178
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:24,280
Would you meet me around the side?

1179
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:34,288
Sarah, everything's all right. Daddy's
just gonna be out for a minute, okay?

1180
01:30:34,362 --> 01:30:36,353
Okay.

1181
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:47,133
Raymond. What she must've been through.

1182
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,142
What's being done to the boys? Nothing.

1183
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:53,139
I won't put her through that again.

1184
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:56,206
Not now. Not with rocks coming
through the windows every night.

1185
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:59,276
Raymond, that's hateful. Oh,
it's not whites throwin' them.

1186
01:31:00,354 --> 01:31:03,414
It's coloreds. No.

1187
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:05,925
Yeah.

1188
01:31:05,993 --> 01:31:10,054
Seems to be the one place where whites
and coloreds are in full harmony.

1189
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:16,497
Anyway, we'll be outta here
soon enough once and for all.

1190
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:19,439
You're moving?

1191
01:31:21,843 --> 01:31:25,472
Yeah. Where to?

1192
01:31:25,546 --> 01:31:27,537
I have a brother in Baltimore,

1193
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:29,674
says he can find me work there.

1194
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:32,943
So we're packing up the house.

1195
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:36,148
Two weeks, Friday, we'll be on
the 4:30 train heading south.

1196
01:31:37,358 --> 01:31:40,293
What about your-- your
business, your shop?

1197
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:42,352
Oh, the business is through.

1198
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:46,292
Nobody's gonna hire me.

1199
01:31:46,367 --> 01:31:51,236
So I'm gonna sell the
shop to a cousin of mine.

1200
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:54,297
Yeah. Things are...

1201
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:56,366
pretty well finished for me here.

1202
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:03,812
I've never lived anywhere
other than Hartford.

1203
01:32:07,488 --> 01:32:09,422
Perhaps...

1204
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:11,981
sometime in the future...

1205
01:32:12,059 --> 01:32:14,152
after you’re
settled, I could--

1206
01:32:15,997 --> 01:32:18,329
Perhaps I could come for a visit,

1207
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:21,858
see Baltimore.

1208
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:23,995
You
see, I--

1209
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:28,208
Well, it seems as if
I'm to be single again.

1210
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:33,776
Oh, Mrs. Whitaker.

1211
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:35,873
Please call me Cathy.

1212
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:41,554
Cathy.

1213
01:32:44,191 --> 01:32:46,523
No one would know us there.

1214
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:55,525
I'm just not sure that
would be a wise idea.

1215
01:32:57,772 --> 01:33:00,240
After,

1216
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:02,242
well,

1217
01:33:03,477 --> 01:33:05,968
everything
that's--

1218
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:09,973
What matters now,

1219
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:14,648
what has to matter the most,
is what's right for Sarah.

1220
01:33:18,559 --> 01:33:21,653
I've learned my lesson
about mixing in other worlds.

1221
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:28,995
I've seen the sparks fly.

1222
01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:34,804
All kinds.

1223
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,643
Have a proud life.

1224
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:51,014
A splendid life.

1225
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:57,522
Will you do that?

1226
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:17,481
Good-bye, Cathy.

1227
01:35:13,307 --> 01:35:17,038
Hello. Cathy, did I wake you?

1228
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:21,346
I-I'm sorry to call this
late. I hope I didn't, uh--

1229
01:35:21,415 --> 01:35:23,349
Uh, no. I was awake.

1230
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:25,351
I, uh, didn't want
to upset the children.

1231
01:35:25,419 --> 01:35:28,980
No. No, of course not.

1232
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:31,581
How are they, by the way?

1233
01:35:31,659 --> 01:35:35,755
Fine. Just fine. They still
ask when you'll be coming home.

1234
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:37,764
I know.

1235
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:41,768
That's, uh, partly
why I'm calling really.

1236
01:35:41,836 --> 01:35:45,431
I got a call from Dick yesterday...

1237
01:35:45,506 --> 01:35:48,100
and he said that everything was set,

1238
01:35:48,175 --> 01:35:50,609
um, papers drawn up.

1239
01:35:50,678 --> 01:35:55,274
And he wanted to know how Thursday
was for you. 3:00 or sometime?

1240
01:35:55,349 --> 01:35:59,683
I-- I told him I thought
you had car pool Thursdays,

1241
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:02,723
but I wasn't absolutely
certain, so I said I would check.

1242
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:06,893
You never could remember
my car pool days.

1243
01:36:06,961 --> 01:36:09,555
And they've always been the same.

1244
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:11,825
Wednesdays and Fridays,
long as I can remember.

1245
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:14,595
Oh, Wednesdays and
Fridays. Right. Uh--

1246
01:36:14,668 --> 01:36:16,761
Same old
absentminded--

1247
01:36:16,837 --> 01:36:20,136
What time... did you say on Thursday?

1248
01:36:21,642 --> 01:36:25,237
What? The appointment. What time?

1249
01:36:27,581 --> 01:36:30,311
Three. Uh, three o'clock.

1250
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:33,177
All right.

1251
01:36:35,256 --> 01:36:39,920
Okay. Uh, well... great.

1252
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:42,095
That-- That was
it, uh, really.

1253
01:36:42,163 --> 01:36:44,495
I... know it's late.

1254
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:47,930
It is.

1255
01:36:48,002 --> 01:36:50,766
So I'll see you on--
on Thursday then.

1256
01:36:54,608 --> 01:36:57,008
See you Thursday.

1257
01:37:00,614 --> 01:37:03,310
Good-bye, Cathy.

1258
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,281
Good-bye, Frank.

1259
01:37:28,976 --> 01:37:32,412
Sixty-seven dollars
and thirty-two cents.

1260
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:34,606
Now, what day is today?

1261
01:37:56,503 --> 01:37:58,596
Oh, Sybil. You don't need to do that.

1262
01:37:58,672 --> 01:38:00,606
It's Friday.

1263
01:38:00,674 --> 01:38:03,438
I know it's Friday, but
there's so much to be done now,

1264
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:05,671
I can hardly expect you
to be polishing tables.

1265
01:38:05,746 --> 01:38:08,874
No reason not to keep
things up. No reason at all.

1266
01:38:10,451 --> 01:38:12,715
I know. Don't forget the grocery list.

1267
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:16,889
Thank you.

1268
01:38:16,957 --> 01:38:19,892
I don't know how on
Earth I'd ever manage--

1269
01:38:54,161 --> 01:38:56,994
I shouldn't be long, Sybil.
All right, Mrs. Whitaker.

1270
01:39:17,384 --> 01:39:19,215
Why are we turning in here?

1271
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:21,151
I'll be right back. Where are you going?

1272
01:39:21,221 --> 01:39:23,621
Now stay put, both of you.

1273
01:39:26,894 --> 01:39:31,888
All aboard! Southbound train
to New York and Washington...

1274
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:33,900
now departing!

1275
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,959
All aboard!

1276
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:42,301
All right. Thanks. I 'l I be seeing you.

1277
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:53,244
All aboard!

1278
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:57,086
Southbound train to New
York and Washington...

1279
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:59,455
now departing.

1280
01:39:59,526 --> 01:40:01,460
All aboard!

1281
01:40:01,528 --> 01:40:03,996
Ready to go?

1282
01:40:04,064 --> 01:40:06,157
That's my girl.

1283
01:40:10,204 --> 01:40:13,002
Wesley! Come on! We'll miss the train.

1284
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:15,007
Don't forget to call
your mother tomorrow.

1285
01:40:15,075 --> 01:40:19,876
All aboard! Southbound
train to New York City--

1286
01:40:19,947 --> 01:40:22,939
- Thank you, sir.
- Here you go. Thanks.

1287
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:25,008
<i>All aboard!</i>

1288
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:50,780
The End @
