58
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,009
Remember, remember
The 5th of November

59
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,869
The gunpowder treason and plot

60
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,310
I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason

61
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,409
Should ever be forgot

62
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,380
But what of the man?

63
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,079
I know his name was Guy Fawkes...

64
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,989
and I know in 1605, he attempted
to blow up the Houses of Parliament.

65
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,390
But who was he really?

66
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,000
What was he like?

67
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,299
We are told to remember the idea
and not the man.

68
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,039
Because a man can fail.

69
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,210
He can be caught,
he can be killed and forgotten.

70
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,439
But 400 years later...

71
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,349
an idea can still change the world.

72
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:37,349
I have witnessed firsthand
the power of ideas.

73
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,950
I've seen people kill
in the name of them...

74
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,490
and die defending them.

75
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,729
But you cannot kiss an idea...

76
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,140
cannot touch it or hold it.

77
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,909
Ideas do not bleed.
They do not feel pain.

78
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,180
They do not love.

79
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,549
And it is not an idea that I miss.

80
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,689
It is a man.

81
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,379
A man that made me remember
the 5th of November.

82
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,650
A man that I will never forget.

83
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:30,079
So I read that the former United States
is so desperate for medical supplies...

84
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,270
that they have allegedly sent several
containers filled with wheat and tobacco.

85
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:38,889
A gesture, they said, of goodwill.

86
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,920
You wanna know what I think?

87
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,719
Well, you're listening to my show,
so I will assume you do.

88
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:48,259
It's high time we let the colonies know
what we really think of them.

89
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,552
I think it's payback time
for a little tea party

90
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,699
they threw for us a few
hundred years ago.

91
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,069
I say we go down to those docks tonight
and dump that crap...

92
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,539
where everything from
the Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica belongs!

93
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,110
Who's with me? Who's bloody with me?!

94
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:04,879
Did you like that?

95
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,210
U.S.A., Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica.
I mean, what else can you say?

96
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,949
Here was a country that had everything,
absolutely everything...

97
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,449
and now, 20 years later, is what?

98
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,289
The world's biggest leper colony. Why?

99
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:21,560
Godlessness.

100
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,319
Let me say that again.

101
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,800
Godlessness.

102
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,500
It wasn't the war they started.
It wasn't the plague they created.

103
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:30,930
It was Judgment.

104
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,240
No one escapes their past.
No one escapes Judgment.

105
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,639
You think he's not up there?

106
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,310
You think he's not watching over
this country?

107
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:45,680
How else can you explain it?
He tested us, but we came through.

108
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,289
We did what we had to do.

109
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,530
Islington. Enfield.
I was there. I saw it all.

110
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,090
Immigrants, Muslims...

111
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,990
homosexuals, terrorists.

112
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,099
Disease-ridden degenerates.
They had to go.

113
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,430
Strength through unity.
Unity through faith.

114
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,569
I am a God-fearing Englishman,
and I'm goddamn proud of it!

115
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,110
That's quite enough of that,
thank you very much.

116
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,509
Oh, shit.

117
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:20,410
A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.

118
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,889
Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest.

119
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,589
This is for your protection.

120
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,029
A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.

121
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,659
Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest.

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,269
This is for your protection.

123
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,370
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, I didn't see you...

124
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,199
- In a hurry, are we?
- I was just...

125
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:44,069
- It's past curfew, you know.
- My uncle, he's very sick.

126
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,033
Sick uncle? What you
think on that, Willy?

127
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:47,840
It's a load of bollocks.

128
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,920
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.

129
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,449
Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.

130
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,750
See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?

131
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,759
Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.

132
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,629
- Don't touch me!
- Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.

133
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,560
- She just threatened us.
- That she did, that she did.

134
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,329
You know what that means,
don't you?

135
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,230
It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.

136
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,269
And you get to swallow it.

137
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,569
- You're Fingermen.
- She's getting the picture.

138
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,470
No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

139
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,639
Not yet you're not. But you will be.

140
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,339
By sunup, if you're not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of London...

141
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,910
then you'll certainly be the sorest.

142
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,629
Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.

143
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,319
I'll go home.
I won't do it again, I swear! Please!

144
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,730
- What do you think, lads?
- Spare the rod, spoil the child.

145
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:39,490
Help me! Someone help!

146
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,000
The multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him.

147
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,209
- What the hell?!
- Bugger off!

148
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,430
Disdaining fortune,
with his brandish'd steel...

149
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,480
which smoked with bloody execution.

150
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,139
We're Fingermen, pal.

151
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,040
Jesus Christ! Mercy!

152
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,379
We are oft to blame in this...
'Tis too much proved.

153
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,389
That with devotiors visage and pious
action we do sugar o'er the devil himself.

154
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,220
- What's that mean?
- Spare the rod.

155
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,899
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.

156
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:47,730
- Who are you?
- Who?

157
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:50,340
Who is but the form
following the function of what...

158
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,340
and what I am is a man in a mask.

159
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,569
- Oh, I can see that.
- Of course you can.

160
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,870
I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.

161
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,139
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.

162
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,949
- Right.
- But on this most auspicious of nights...

163
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,420
permit me then, in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet...

164
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:12,720
to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona.

165
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,490
Voila!

166
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,660
In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran...

167
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:22,000
cast vicariously as both victim and
villain by the vicissitudes of fate.

168
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,870
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity...

169
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,529
is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished.

170
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:33,079
However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified...

171
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,980
and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice...

172
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:40,949
and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition.

173
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,220
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta...

174
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,100
held as a votive not in vain,
for the value and veracity of such...

175
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:57,569
shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous.

176
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,069
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.

177
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,180
So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you...

178
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,050
and you may call me V.

179
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,310
Are you, like, a crazy person?

180
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,509
I am quite sure they will say so.

181
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:17,660
But to whom, might I ask, am I speaking?

182
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,689
- I'm Evey.
- Evey?

183
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,230
E-vey. Of course you are.

184
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:27,100
- What does that mean?
- It means that I, like God...

185
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:30,500
do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence.

186
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,500
Are you hurt?

187
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,340
No, I'm fine.

188
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,200
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, I merely played my part.

189
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:42,080
- But tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey?
- I suppose.

190
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,279
You see, I'm a musician of sorts...

191
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,850
and on my way to give
a very special performance.

192
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:48,580
What kind of musician?

193
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,620
Percussion instruments
are my specialty.

194
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:54,129
But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event...

195
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,320
and would be honored
if you could join me.

196
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,629
I don't think so.
I should be getting home.

197
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,360
I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.

198
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:04,299
And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.

199
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,769
All right.

200
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,139
It's beautiful up here.

201
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,710
A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.

202
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,379
I don't see any instruments.

203
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:20,450
Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.

204
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,850
But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto...

205
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:29,330
in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts...

206
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,529
and in recognition of the imposter
that stands in her stead.

207
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,929
Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?

208
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:41,470
- November the 4th?
- Not anymore.

209
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,909
Remember, remember
The 5th of November

210
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,149
The gunpowder treason and plot

211
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,289
I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason

212
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,990
Should ever be forgot

213
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,700
First, the overture.

214
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:09,759
Yes.

215
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:12,200
Yes, the strings.

216
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,840
Listen carefully, can you hear it?

217
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,110
Now the brass.

218
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,009
I can hear it!

219
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,080
Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!

220
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,929
- How do you do that?
- Wait.

221
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,029
Here comes the crescendo!

222
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,110
How beautiful, is it not?

223
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,960
Gentlemen, you have had four hours.
You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.

224
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,059
The Bailey area is quarantined.

225
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,460
All significant witnesses
have been detained.

226
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,860
Good. Mr. Etheridge?

227
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:16,059
A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.

228
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,000
The DCD was Tchaikovsky's
1812 Overture.

229
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,610
Add it to the blacklist.
I never want to hear that again.

230
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,009
Yes, sir.

231
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:26,909
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance...

232
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,639
indicating a high percentage of
conversation concerned with the explosion.

233
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,789
Mr. Dascomb,
what are we doing about that?

234
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,360
We're calling it an emergency demolition.

235
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,549
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the interlink.

236
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,817
Several experts have
been lined up to testify

237
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:42,929
against the Bailey's
structural integrity.

238
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,070
I want Prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings...

239
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,690
and how we must avoid clinging
to the edifice of a decadent past.

240
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,539
He should conclude that the New Bailey
will become the symbol of our time...

241
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,840
and the future
that our conviction has rewarded us.

242
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,240
Mr. Heyer.

243
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:01,610
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist...

244
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:05,149
though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.

245
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,490
We also managed to get a picture of the
girl that Creedy's men were detaining.

246
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:12,960
- Who is she, Mr. Finch?
- Not sure yet, sir.

247
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:15,649
- But we're working on several leads.
- Anything else?

248
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,629
We located the fireworks launch...

249
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,669
and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.

250
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,100
Unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication...

251
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,970
these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals...

252
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,639
making them very difficult to trace.

253
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,649
Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.

254
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,190
Spare us your professional annotations,
Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.

255
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,090
Apologies, chancellor.

256
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,889
Gentlemen, this is a test.

257
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:46,690
Moments such as these
are matters of faith.

258
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,059
To fail is to invite doubt
into everything we believe...

259
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,929
everything we have fought for.

260
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,039
Doubt will plunge this country back
into chaos, and I will not let that happen.

261
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,730
Gentlemen, I want this terrorist found...

262
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:04,240
and I want him to understand
what terror really means.

263
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,879
England prevails.

264
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,610
England prevails.

265
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,120
- You think people will buy this?
- Why not?

266
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:20,190
This is the BTN.

267
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,090
Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.

268
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,769
That's the government's job.

269
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:29,029
On the lighter side of things...

270
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,700
seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the Old Bailey...

271
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,940
wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff.

272
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:40,009
Although the demolition had been
planned for some time...

273
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,240
the music and the fireworks were,
according to the crew chief...

274
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:46,289
"definitely not on the schedule."
We'll be right back.

275
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,289
Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.

276
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,929
I saw it, the whole thing.

277
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:54,789
- Did you see it?
- No. Last night I was...

278
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,259
Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?

279
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:00,929
Evey, there you are.

280
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,259
- You are still working for me.
- Sorry, Patricia.

281
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,809
I need two espressos and three coffees.

282
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,970
And Deitrich is ready for his tea.

283
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,440
I don't get it.

284
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,679
Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask?
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?

285
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,809
It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.

286
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,250
Maybe he's just getting started.

287
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,490
Yeah?

288
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,990
Okay. A lead on the girl.

289
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,100
Look, don't get me wrong, I love it.
A cow getting crucified.

290
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,440
It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.

291
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,299
You've got to rewrite it, okay?
Gotta go.

292
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,039
I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.

293
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,970
- Mr. Deitrich...
- Gordon, please.

294
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,710
I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.

295
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,509
Gordon...

296
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,620
I was on my way last night,
but there were Fingermen...

297
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,379
and I got scared and went home.

298
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:57,049
Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.

299
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,870
Gotcha.

300
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:21,210
- Hey, Fred.
- All that been x-rayed?

301
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,250
Nope. They're filled with bombs.

302
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:25,679
Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?

303
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,179
- I can't believe you watch that shit.
- What?

304
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,289
Laser Lass is banging.

305
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:46,159
What's all that?

306
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,440
Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.

307
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,269
Must be Prothero.

308
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,779
I wish someone had the balls to tell that
brat this station ain't his playground.

309
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,409
What the hell is this?

310
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:05,250
Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.

311
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,730
This looks serious.
Her parents were political activists.

312
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,059
- They were detained when she was 12.
- What happened to her?

313
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,570
Juvenile Reclamation Project...

314
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,899
- for five years.
- Shit.

315
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,440
We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.

316
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,940
You sure about that, sir?

317
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,269
I want a chance to talk to her before she
disappears into one of Creedy's black bags.

318
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,649
Who's that?

319
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,659
Don't piss me about. You show me ID,
or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.

320
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,000
Fucking hell.

321
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,539
Come on, let's move!

322
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,099
You two, cover these elevators.
The rest of you follow me.

323
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,930
Attention. Attention.

324
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,900
Will all personnel please
evacuate the building.

325
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,829
This is not a drill.

326
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:30,029
Will all personnel evacuate the building.

327
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,309
What the hell's going on?

328
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,509
- It's jammed.
- Break it down.

329
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,690
Dominic!

330
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,130
Police! Out of the way!

331
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:52,359
Get out the way!

332
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,369
Damn it!

333
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:07,319
I'll tell you what I know.
I'll tell you what I know.

334
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,150
I'll tell you what I know.
England prevails.

335
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,890
- Clear the halls.
- Sir.

336
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:18,089
Help, Storm, help!

337
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,700
Don't touch it.

338
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:33,000
Dad, what's wrong with the telly?

339
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:50,720
Good evening, London.

340
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,190
- Allow me first to apologize...
- That's the emergency channel!

341
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,490
I do, like many of you, appreciate
the comforts of the everyday routine...

342
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,660
the security of the familiar,
the tranquility of repetition.

343
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,930
Bloody hell.

344
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,599
I enjoy them as much as any bloke.
But in the spirit of commemoration...

345
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:08,829
Who's that, Mum?

346
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:10,910
Whereby important events of the past...

347
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:15,109
usually associated with someone's death or
the end of some awful, bloody struggle...

348
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,880
are celebrated with a nice holiday...

349
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:20,579
I thought we could mark
this November the 5th...

350
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:23,049
a day that is, sadly,
no longer remembered...

351
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,829
by taking some time out of our daily
lives to sit down and have a little chat.

352
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,990
There are, of course,
those who do not want us to speak.

353
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,430
Let me think, let me think.

354
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:35,089
Even now, orders are being shouted
into telephones...

355
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:37,470
and men with guns
will soon be on their way.

356
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,470
- It's Chancellor Sutler.
- Damn it!

357
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,009
Why? Because while the truncheon
may be used in lieu of conversation...

358
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,980
words will always retain their power.

359
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,619
Words offer the means to meaning...

360
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,980
and, for those who will listen,
the enunciation of truth.

361
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,549
And the truth is...

362
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,119
there is something terribly wrong
with this country, isn't there?

363
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:01,690
You designed it, wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!

364
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:05,460
Cruelty and injustice,
intolerance and oppression.

365
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,970
And where once
you had the freedom to object...

366
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,930
to think and speak as you saw fit...

367
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:13,339
you now have censors and surveillance
coercing your conformity...

368
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:16,339
and soliciting submission.
Cameras. We need cameras.

369
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,170
How did this happen? Who's to blame?

370
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,619
Certainly there are those
who are more responsible than others.

371
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:24,680
And they will be held accountable.

372
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,819
But again, truth be told,
if you're looking for the guilty...

373
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,720
you need only look into a mirror.

374
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,019
I know why you did it.

375
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,890
I know you were afraid.

376
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:38,589
Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease.

377
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:41,460
There were a myriad of problems
which conspired...

378
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,000
to corrupt your reason
and rob you of your common sense.

379
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,769
Fear got the best of you.

380
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,170
And in your panic, you turned to
the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.

381
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:53,869
He promised you order,
he promised you peace...

382
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,809
and all he demanded in return
was your silent, obedient consent.

383
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,750
- Inspector, they're almost through.
- Last night, I sought to end that silence.

384
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,220
Last night,
I destroyed the Old Bailey...

385
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,759
to remind this country
of what it has forgotten.

386
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,259
More than 400 years ago, a great citizen
wished to imbed the 5th of November...

387
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,900
forever in our memory.

388
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:18,730
His hope was to remind the world
that fairness, justice and freedom...

389
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,900
are more than words.

390
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,670
They are perspectives.

391
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,710
So if you've seen nothing...

392
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,650
if the crimes of this government
remain unknown to you...

393
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:33,079
then I would suggest that you allow
the 5th of November to pass unmarked.

394
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:36,380
But if you see what I see...

395
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,119
if you feel as I feel,
and if you would seek as I seek...

396
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:44,200
then I ask you to stand beside me,
one year from tonight...

397
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,529
outside the gates of Parliament.

398
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,430
And together, we shall give them
a 5th of November...

399
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,799
that shall never, ever be forgot.

400
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:01,109
Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.

401
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,809
Cover the exits.

402
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,750
No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.

403
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,390
Left.

404
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,960
You go right.

405
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,750
Spread out.

406
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,470
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!

407
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,329
Hold your fire!

408
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,470
He put masks on all of us.

409
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,910
Jesus.

410
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,579
- Don't shoot!
- Wait!

411
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:40,309
- Wait!
- Hold your fire!

412
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,650
Freeze! Nobody move!

413
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:45,089
If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!

414
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:52,430
- Get their masks off.
- Please hurry!

415
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,130
There's a bomb in the control booth.

416
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:57,930
Oh, no.

417
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:02,269
- Jones, get anyone not wearing a mask out.
- Yes, sir.

418
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,809
- Marshal, help carry this man.
- Sir.

419
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,539
Everyone else, let's go.

420
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,480
Good God.

421
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,059
Hurry up, you lot! Come on!
Everybody out!

422
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:29,869
Dascomb.

423
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:33,910
Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?

424
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,130
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

425
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:37,470
Wait, wait!

426
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,150
Don't shoot me, please! It's him! It's him!

427
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,809
On your knees! On your knees!

428
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,380
Please! Please don't hurt me!

429
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,079
Here we go.

430
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,119
I did it.

431
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,720
I did it.

432
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:30,900
Freeze!

433
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,859
Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.

434
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,299
I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of Londons finest.

435
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,539
I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.

436
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,309
We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.

437
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,779
I don't know about that.

438
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,423
We're interrupting your
regularly scheduled

439
00:25:05,435 --> 00:25:07,599
program to bring you this
terrifying report...

440
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:11,400
of a terrorist takeover of Jordan Tower
which ended only moments ago.

441
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:14,799
A psychotic terrorist,
identified only as the letter V...

442
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,940
attacked the control booth with
high-powered explosives and weapons...

443
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:23,240
that he used against unarmed civilians
in order to broadcast a message of hate.

444
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,019
We've just received this footage
of a daring police raid.

445
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,829
Stop! Stop, stay where you are,
or we'll shoot! Stay where you are!

446
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:38,329
Now, this is only an initial report...

447
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,500
but at this time, it's believed
that during this heroic raid...

448
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,500
the terrorist was shot and killed.

449
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,900
Bollocks.

450
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:49,529
Again, from what we've been told
by authorities, the danger is now over.

451
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,339
The terrorist is dead.

452
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:58,220
Right there. What's he thinking?

453
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,849
Is he considering leaving her?

454
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,460
After she just saved him?

455
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:09,690
He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.

456
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,920
Some part of him's human.

457
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,029
And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.

458
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,619
- You scared me.
- My apologies.

459
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,720
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, thank you.

460
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,329
- What is this place?
- It's my home.

461
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,960
- I call it the Shadow Gallery.
- It's beautiful.

462
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,069
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Oh, here and there.

463
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,829
Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.

464
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:03,940
- You stole them?
- Heavens, no.

465
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:05,980
Stealing implies ownership.

466
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,309
You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.

467
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,250
God, if they ever find this place...

468
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,380
I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.

469
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:17,819
You mean, after what you've done.

470
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,660
God, what have I done?

471
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:22,960
I Maced that detective.
Why did I do that?

472
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,690
- You did what you thought was right.
- No, I shouldn't have done that.

473
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:28,799
I must have been out of my mind.

474
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,200
Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?

475
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,200
I think I should go.

476
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,430
- May I ask where?
- Home. I have to go home.

477
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:40,549
They're looking for you. If they know
where you work, they know where you live.

478
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,549
- I have friends, I could stay with them.
- I'm afraid that won't work either.

479
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,849
You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us...

480
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,680
but I couldn't see any other way.

481
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:53,119
You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.

482
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:57,490
If I had left you there, right now you'd be
in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.

483
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,569
They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you...

484
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,700
in the pursuit of finding me.

485
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:06,269
After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen...

486
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,430
so I picked you up and carried you
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:

487
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:12,200
Here, to my home.

488
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:16,150
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.

489
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,750
I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.

490
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,910
But I don't even know where this is.

491
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:24,079
You know it's underground.
You know the color of the stone.

492
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:28,289
- That'd be enough for a clever man.
- Are you saying that I have to stay here?

493
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,829
Only until I'm done. After the 5th,
I no longer think it'll matter.

494
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,970
You mean a year from now?

495
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,930
I have to stay here for a year?

496
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:39,069
Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.

497
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,900
You should've left me alone.

498
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,440
Why didn't you just leave me alone?!

499
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:49,440
- Anything else on the parents?
- Yeah, it ain't good.

500
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:51,640
They were interned at Belmarsh.

501
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:53,509
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

502
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,089
She died in a hunger strike.
He died when the military retook the shed.

503
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,549
And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.

504
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,890
- Christ.
- It's nothing but bad luck here.

505
00:30:04,329 --> 00:30:07,769
So we know her story. Now we need his.

506
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:30,789
V?

507
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,019
I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.

508
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,859
I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.

509
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,400
Your hands.

510
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:47,369
Yes.

511
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:53,339
There, that's better.

512
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:55,569
I hope I didn't put you off your appetite.

513
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,623
No, please. It's just...
Are you all right?

514
00:30:57,635 --> 00:30:59,519
Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.

515
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,119
Can I ask what happened?

516
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:05,180
There was a fire. A long time ago.

517
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,490
Ancient history, for some.

518
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,529
Not really very good table conversation.

519
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,359
Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?

520
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,130
- Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually.
- Have a seat.

521
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:26,839
- It's delicious.
- Good.

522
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:30,109
God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.

523
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,509
Where did you get it?

524
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,880
A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.

525
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:38,759
- You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
- Yes.

526
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,150
You're insane.

527
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:44,200
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.

528
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,799
- Macbeth.
- Very good.

529
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,900
My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me...

530
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:52,339
and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.

531
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:54,910
Be in plays, movies.

532
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,640
When I was 9, I played Viola
in Twelfth Night. Mum was very proud.

533
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:00,869
Where is your mother now?

534
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,849
She's dead.

535
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:04,250
I'm sorry.

536
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:07,813
Can I ask about what
you said on the telly?

537
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,059
Yes.

538
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,819
- Did you mean it?
- Every word.

539
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,930
You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?

540
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,390
There's no certainty, only opportunity.

541
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:20,130
You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up...

542
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:22,200
Creedy'll black-bag every one of them.

543
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,940
People should not be afraid
of their governments.

544
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,970
Governments should be afraid
of their people.

545
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,539
And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?

546
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:34,250
The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.

547
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,180
Symbols are given power by people.

548
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:40,119
Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people...

549
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:42,950
blowing up a building
can change the world.

550
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:45,890
I wish I believed that was possible.

551
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:50,589
But every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.

552
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:54,759
I'll tell you what I know.
I know this is not a man.

553
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,930
- What is he?
- A man does not wear a mask.

554
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,728
What is he?

555
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,369
A man does not threaten
innocent civilians.

556
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:05,009
He's what every gutless,
freedom-hating terrorist is:

557
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,410
A goddamn coward!

558
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,920
There will be no negotiation.

559
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:14,579
When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.

560
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,250
I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.

561
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,119
My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.

562
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,750
Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!

563
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,730
So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.

564
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,170
Find another DOP
or find yourself another job.

565
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,230
I'll tell you what I wish.

566
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,369
I wish I'd been there.

567
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,640
I wish I'd had the chance
for a face-to-face.

568
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,609
Just one chance, that's all I'd need.

569
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,920
This so-called V and his accomplice,
Evey Hammond...

570
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:54,390
neo-demagogues,
spouting their message of hate.

571
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,119
A delusional and aberrant voice
delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.

572
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:03,000
An ultimatum that was met
with swift and surgically precise justice.

573
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,970
- No mercy!
- The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is:

574
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,340
Good guys win, bad guys lose...

575
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,909
and, as always, England prevails!

576
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,849
Holy Christ! Jesus!

577
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,119
Good evening, Commander Prothero.

578
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:21,849
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?

579
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:25,150
Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by...

580
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,559
any pesky late-night phone calls,
commander.

581
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,530
Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?

582
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,460
That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.

583
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,360
You wore a uniform in those days.

584
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,130
You.

585
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:46,000
- It is you.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past.

586
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,449
- Yeah?
- Finch, it's Dascomb.

587
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:00,730
- Dascomb.
- I've already called the chancellor.

588
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,730
- We have to get control of the situation.
- What situation?

589
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,289
Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.

590
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:13,030
In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London...

591
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,230
could be devastating to our credibility.

592
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:18,199
Perhaps a stroke?

593
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,150
No, no, it's too horrific.

594
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,050
A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.

595
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,980
- We got any eyes or ears on this?
- No, camcos were cut.

596
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:33,650
It's the same m.o. As before.
But we got an elevator log ID.

597
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:37,230
- Let me guess.
- She's in deep, inspector.

598
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,289
V?

599
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,239
My fat, metal friend.

600
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:02,789
Mondego.

601
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,489
Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.

602
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,329
No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.

603
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,800
My favorite film:

604
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:21,429
The Count of Monte Cristo,
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.

605
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,840
It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.

606
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,610
It gets me every time.

607
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,809
- Never seen it.
- Really?

608
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:33,250
- Would you like to?
- Does it have a happy ending?

609
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,679
As only celluloid can deliver.

610
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:37,550
Okay.

611
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,690
Put the sword away.

612
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,130
Forensics just wrapped.

613
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,960
No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.

614
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,960
You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.

615
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,190
- Drugs?
- Could've started his own hospital.

616
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:51,929
- Interesting.
- Why?

617
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,510
Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country...

618
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,440
before he was
the Voice of London?

619
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,079
- Drugs?
- Legal ones.

620
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,010
Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.

621
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:07,420
Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?

622
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,119
When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.

623
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,619
May we come up?

624
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:17,320
- You find your own tree.
- You find your own tree.

625
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,829
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

626
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,840
- But it made me feel sorry for Mercedes.
- Why?

627
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,840
Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.

628
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,550
Nationwide were devastated
as news of the most popular...

629
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,949
Wait. What's this?

630
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,820
Most awarded stars
in the history of the BTN...

631
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:45,079
a man known to the entire nation
as "The Voice of London"...

632
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,059
passed away late last night
from apparent heart failure.

633
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,489
- She's lying.
- How do you know?

634
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,659
She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.

635
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,000
It came as no surprise
to those who knew him...

636
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,900
that his body was at his office...

637
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,809
where he often worked long hours
after everyone else had gone home.

638
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,500
Lewis, you will be sorely missed.

639
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:16,179
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.

640
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,050
You didn't take it, did you?

641
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,250
Would you prefer a lie or the truth?

642
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,190
Did you have anything to do with that?

643
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,300
- Yes, I killed him.
- You...

644
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:29,940
- Oh, God.
- You're upset.

645
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,570
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.

646
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:36,139
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.

647
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:38,780
- What?
- Violence can be used for good.

648
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,710
- What are you talking about?
- Justice.

649
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:48,150
Oh, I see.

650
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:51,119
There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.

651
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,619
And are you going to kill more people?

652
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,429
Yes.

653
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,900
Take a look at this.

654
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,539
Prothero's military record.

655
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,869
What do you see?

656
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:12,010
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.

657
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:13,769
- Busy boy.
- But after all that...

658
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:17,610
they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.

659
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,579
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

660
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,719
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

661
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:28,760
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

662
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:33,260
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

663
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:38,769
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

664
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,309
- You're welcome to review our records.
- We've been through your records.

665
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,000
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill...

666
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:48,710
approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

667
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,010
Well, there you have it.

668
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,510
This is a matter of some urgency, major.

669
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,849
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

670
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,349
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

671
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,289
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

672
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:06,559
- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?

673
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,639
- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?

674
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,000
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records...

675
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:17,699
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

676
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,809
As head of the Detention Program
at that...

677
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,849
Before you go any further, let me remind
you things were very chaotic back then.

678
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,719
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

679
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:29,480
We all did what we had to do.

680
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:32,889
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

681
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:34,889
That's all I have to say about that.

682
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,000
You can do this.

683
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,579
Hi.

684
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,739
I've been thinking...

685
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,079
There's something I want to ask you...

686
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,090
but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

687
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,860
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

688
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,199
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth...

689
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:16,800
while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.

690
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:19,130
A man after my own heart.

691
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:21,969
He always told the best stories.

692
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,440
Until my brother died.

693
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,750
That was when everything changed.

694
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:34,079
My brother was one of the students
at St. Mary's.

695
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,090
After he died,
my parents became political.

696
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,659
They protested the war
and the Reclamation.

697
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:48,500
When Sutler was appointed high chancellor,
they were at the riot in Leeds.

698
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,639
I watched on the television...

699
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,239
thinking I was going
to see my parents killed.

700
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:56,280
I remember them arguing at night.

701
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,780
Mum wanted to leave the country.
Dad refused.

702
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:02,969
He said if we ran away, they would win.

703
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,809
Win, like... it was a game.

704
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,449
Evey, quick, hide!

705
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,369
- Mummy!
- Evey!

706
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:28,940
I never saw them again.

707
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,280
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.

708
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,210
I'm sorry, Evey.

709
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,980
No, I'm the one that's sorry.

710
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,449
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.

711
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,610
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...

712
00:42:44,989 --> 00:42:46,480
but I'm not.

713
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,360
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

714
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,500
but I am.

715
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:57,230
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

716
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,210
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right...

717
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,340
please let me know.

718
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,170
If you wish.

719
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,380
Do you really think
you'll find something here?

720
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:19,079
Worth a shot.

721
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:22,019
One thing is true of all governments:

722
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:26,000
The most reliable records
are tax records.

723
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,809
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

724
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,880
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

725
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:44,039
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

726
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:46,480
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

727
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:49,119
Thanks. This is a great help.

728
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:04,059
"By the power of truth, I, while living,
have conquered the universe."

729
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:07,369
- Personal motto?
- From Faust.

730
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:09,980
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?

731
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:12,309
It is. And speaking of the devil...

732
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,239
I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.

733
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,750
- Of course.
- It appears unforeseen circumstances...

734
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,719
have accelerated my original plan.

735
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:24,619
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.

736
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:26,050
I'll do my best.

737
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:28,320
I believe you will.

738
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:36,800
Another doctor. Why does
a detention facility need so many doctors?

739
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:38,869
I don't know, but this is interesting.

740
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,500
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

741
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:45,769
- Really?
- Yeah, Father Lilliman.

742
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:49,780
- Lilliman.
- Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

743
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:52,179
Now, that is interesting.

744
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,750
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.

745
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:02,130
- Your Grace.
- Oh, Denis.

746
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,989
- Has everything been arranged?
- Yes.

747
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,289
I've just received your
interlink itinerary.

748
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:09,329
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

749
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,989
You're most diligent, Denis...

750
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:15,130
a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but...

751
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:17,869
- Your Grace?
- It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

752
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:21,070
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

753
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,480
My last little joy.

754
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,409
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

755
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:29,920
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.

756
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,320
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

757
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:34,889
Older?

758
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:37,219
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

759
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,630
That is for Your Grace to decide.

760
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,409
- Oh, my.
- Your Grace.

761
00:45:56,019 --> 00:46:01,010
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.

762
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,619
Mea culpa, my child.

763
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:07,050
Mea culpa.

764
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:16,099
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.

765
00:46:16,269 --> 00:46:20,300
A confession?
I love the confessional game.

766
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:22,369
Tell me your sins.

767
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:24,369
This isn't a game, Your Grace.

768
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,840
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

769
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,780
- I'm sorry?
- I'm telling you this...

770
00:46:28,949 --> 00:46:31,510
because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

771
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:35,349
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.

772
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,619
- I think this should balance it out.
- What are you talking about?

773
00:46:38,789 --> 00:46:40,659
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...

774
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:44,019
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.

775
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:47,500
I'm telling you that any moment,
he's going to come through that door.

776
00:46:47,699 --> 00:46:51,030
I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.

777
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,500
Wonderful!

778
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,969
It's a game I've never played!

779
00:46:56,139 --> 00:47:00,099
What a delightful mind you have. I hope
the rest of you is just as interesting.

780
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,550
- No, please, you have to believe me.
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.

781
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,809
Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.

782
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,420
Stop it! Get off of me!

783
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:09,710
Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.

784
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:11,980
Now, how best to procure
her confession?

785
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,059
You little bitch. You fucking little whore!

786
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,590
- Reverend.
- Oh, my God.

787
00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:23,460
She wasn't lying. It is you.

788
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:25,659
I'm sorry.

789
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,530
- I had to.
- Evey!

790
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:34,440
And thus I clothe my naked villainy...

791
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,639
with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ...

792
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,949
and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil.

793
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,090
Oh, please, have mercy.

794
00:47:43,289 --> 00:47:45,190
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.

795
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,050
Not tonight.

796
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,150
Don't do this, I beg of you.

797
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:53,489
Well, then. Childrens hour at the abbey.

798
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,659
Open your mouth
and stick out your tongue.

799
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,170
- What the...?
- I don't want to die!

800
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,599
This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.

801
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:09,079
Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.

802
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,909
- Tonight.
- Yes, sir.

803
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:13,650
Pucker up, here comes the Finger.

804
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:17,119
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.

805
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:23,260
Creedy.

806
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:24,789
What are you doing here?

807
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:29,829
Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.

808
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,239
This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.

809
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:37,210
The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.

810
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,400
It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.

811
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:43,780
The security of information
is paramount.

812
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,789
In these volatile times...

813
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:48,789
mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated...

814
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,320
if, indeed,
Jordan Tower was an accident.

815
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:53,760
- What does that mean?
- Terrorist seems to have...

816
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:56,519
a rather intimate understanding
of our system.

817
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:59,500
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.

818
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,199
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?

819
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:04,130
At this time, it would behoove you...

820
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:09,300
to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed...

821
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,880
and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.

822
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,840
You mean Larkhill?

823
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:18,579
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.

824
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:22,019
- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?

825
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:26,119
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?

826
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:29,920
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?

827
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,800
I've been a party member for 27 years.

828
00:49:33,969 --> 00:49:36,269
If I were you, chief inspector...

829
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,599
I'd find the terrorist...

830
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:40,739
and I'd find him soon.

831
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,599
Please.

832
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:51,909
Evey? Good God!

833
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,610
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.

834
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:59,579
Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.

835
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:10,730
- Cheers.
- I know every cop's looking for me.

836
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,570
I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.

837
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:16,139
- Evey...
- You could be in terrible trouble.

838
00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:17,800
Evey, listen to me.

839
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,849
If the government ever searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.

840
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,679
You trusted me.

841
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:30,909
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.

842
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:46,699
Oh, my God.
That's God Save the Queen.

843
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:49,570
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.

844
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,800
- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.

845
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,780
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel...

846
00:50:56,949 --> 00:50:58,780
it always cheers me up.

847
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,949
- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.

848
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,289
- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.

849
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:09,489
But why would you keep it?

850
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:12,889
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful, poetry moving.

851
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,030
Is it worth it?
If they found that here...

852
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:17,500
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.

853
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:20,110
Thank you, Gordon.

854
00:51:20,269 --> 00:51:22,400
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.

855
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:26,030
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.

856
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:28,409
I was on my way here, and...

857
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:31,679
Yes.

858
00:51:34,889 --> 00:51:37,409
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.

859
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:39,719
- But...
- You're wondering why...

860
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,449
you were invited here to supper
in the first place...

861
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:46,690
if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.

862
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:50,429
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain...

863
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:53,199
young and attractive ladies
like yourself.

864
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:57,170
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired...

865
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:01,300
I would undoubtedly find myself without
a home, let alone a television show.

866
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,449
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

867
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,650
The truth is, after so many years...

868
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,260
you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.

869
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,449
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.

870
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,260
I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.

871
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,460
You could get these poisons
from any house in London.

872
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,199
Thanks, Delia.

873
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:31,380
Any leads on finding this guy?

874
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,880
Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.

875
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,679
You started as a botanist, didn't you?

876
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,559
It's... It's a Scarlet Carson.

877
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:48,389
They're believed to be extinct.

878
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,489
He leaves them at the crime scenes.

879
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,360
I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.

880
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:57,090
Any information could be helpful.

881
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,429
Of course.

882
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,239
Excuse me.

883
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:04,199
Yeah?

884
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,639
I just finished going through the file,
inspector. You better get back here.

885
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,280
Yeah, okay.

886
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,150
- My God. He's killed them all.
- All but one.

887
00:53:16,289 --> 00:53:18,780
- Who is she?
- Not sure.

888
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,519
She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.

889
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:25,190
But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.

890
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,960
Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.

891
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:30,000
Running away?

892
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:34,329
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.

893
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:36,909
- She changed her name.
- That's what I'm guessing.

894
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:40,139
I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.

895
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:43,650
- It's late, or early.
- Call them again. I want that name.

896
00:53:43,675 --> 00:53:46,675
SharePirate.Com - Convenient Downloads for Members

897
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,429
What? Are you sure about that?

898
00:53:57,929 --> 00:53:59,329
Okay. Thank you.

899
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,699
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.

900
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:06,130
- The coroner?
- Yeah.

901
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,409
Jesus, I just saw her.

902
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:19,280
It's you, isn't it?

903
00:54:19,949 --> 00:54:23,010
- You've come to kill me.
- Yes.

904
00:54:24,489 --> 00:54:26,389
Thank God.

905
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm sorry, I can't get a response
from that number.

906
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:33,099
There's a problem with the connection.

907
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:35,099
Jesus Christ.

908
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,070
He's there.

909
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:41,539
After what happened,
after what they did...

910
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,030
I thought about killing myself.

911
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:49,409
But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.

912
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:52,909
I didn't know what
they were going to do.

913
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:55,309
I swear to you.

914
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,119
Read my journal.

915
00:54:57,289 --> 00:55:00,519
What they did was only possible
because of you.

916
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,989
Oppeneimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.

917
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,000
He changed the entire course
of human history.

918
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:12,829
Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?

919
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,170
I have not come
for what you hoped to do.

920
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,210
I've come for what you did.

921
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,010
It's funny.

922
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:24,010
I was given one of your roses today.

923
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:28,480
I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.

924
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:34,320
What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.

925
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,989
There are no coincidences, Delia.

926
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:41,130
Only the illusion of coincidence.

927
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,289
I have another rose.

928
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,840
And this one is for you.

929
00:55:52,409 --> 00:55:56,349
- You're going to kill me now?
- I killed you 10 minutes ago...

930
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,909
while you slept.

931
00:55:59,949 --> 00:56:02,650
- Is there any pain?
- No.

932
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,289
Thank you.

933
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,820
Is it meaningless to apologize?

934
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,360
Never.

935
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,530
I'm so sorry.

936
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,889
Damn it.

937
00:56:40,389 --> 00:56:43,230
The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.

938
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,960
He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.

939
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:50,159
Am I to understand that you have read
this document, inspector?

940
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:52,429
- Yes, sir.
- Has anyone else read it?

941
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,027
No, sir.

942
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:55,469
Then let me make this
perfectly clear to you.

943
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:59,130
The contents of this document
are a matter of national security...

944
00:56:59,309 --> 00:57:03,179
constituting an assault on the character
of several important party members...

945
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:06,820
as well as a blatant violation
of the Articles of Allegiance.

946
00:57:06,989 --> 00:57:09,889
As the authenticity of this document
cannot be verified...

947
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:13,889
it could be an elaborate forgery
created by the terrorist...

948
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:17,760
as easily as it could be the deranged
fantasy of a former party member...

949
00:57:17,929 --> 00:57:20,090
who resigned
for psychological reasons.

950
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:23,159
Any discussion of this document
or its contents...

951
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,269
will be regarded, at the very least,
as an act of sedition...

952
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,909
if not a willful act of treason.

953
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:32,409
- Is that understood, Mr. Finch?
- Yes, sir.

954
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:35,280
You would do well, inspector...

955
00:57:35,449 --> 00:57:37,849
to put it out of your mind.

956
00:57:46,989 --> 00:57:48,760
May 23rd.

957
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:53,000
My first batch of subjects arrived today...

958
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:56,900
and I have to admit
that I'm very excited.

959
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:02,869
This could be the dawn of a new age.

960
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,809
Nuclear power is meaningless...

961
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,949
in a world where a virus
can kill an entire population...

962
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,170
and leave its wealth intact.

963
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:14,480
- Stay together!
- Come on, move!

964
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,949
May 27th.

965
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,250
Commander Prothero toured the lab
with a priest, Father Lilliman...

966
00:58:20,429 --> 00:58:24,260
who I was told is here to monitor
for Rules and Rights violations.

967
00:58:24,429 --> 00:58:28,699
It made me nervous, but the commander
assured me there wouldn't be a problem.

968
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,730
June 2nd.

969
00:58:31,369 --> 00:58:35,099
I keep wondering if these people knew
how they might be helping their country...

970
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,610
if they would act any differently.

971
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:41,710
They're so weak and pathetic.
They never look you in the eye.

972
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,349
I find myself hating them.

973
00:58:47,449 --> 00:58:49,389
August the 18th.

974
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:53,320
Of the original four dozen,
over 75 percent are now deceased.

975
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:59,090
No controllable pattern has yet emerged.

976
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,599
September the 18th.

977
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:05,829
There is one case that continues
to give me hope.

978
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:10,670
He exhibits none of the immune-system
pathologies the other subjects developed.

979
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:15,340
I've discovered cellular anomalies in his
blood that I've been unable to categorize.

980
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:17,349
The mutations seem to have triggered...

981
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:21,480
the abnormal development
of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.

982
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,820
The subject said
he could no longer remember...

983
00:59:23,989 --> 00:59:26,719
who he was or where he was from.

984
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:30,659
Whoever he was,
he is now the key to our dream...

985
00:59:30,829 --> 00:59:34,360
and the hope that all of this
will not have been in vain.

986
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,130
November the 5th.

987
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,769
It started last night, around midnight.

988
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:46,809
The first explosions tore open
the entire medical section.

989
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:50,809
All my work, gone.

990
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:55,010
I was trying to understand how
it could've happened when I saw him.

991
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:57,420
The man from room 5.

992
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:58,820
He looked at me.

993
00:59:58,989 --> 01:00:02,429
Not with eyes. There were no eyes.

994
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,119
But I know he was looking at me
because I felt it.

995
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:16,599
Oh, God... what have I done?

996
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:50,170
What is that you're making?

997
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,869
We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.

998
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,880
- This is weird.
- What?

999
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:58,510
The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.

1000
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:00,980
- Really?
- I swear.

1001
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:05,920
That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.

1002
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:08,030
- There is?
- Yes, Evey.

1003
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,019
I am V.

1004
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,659
At last you know the truth.

1005
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,530
You're stunned, I know.

1006
01:01:13,699 --> 01:01:17,329
Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior...

1007
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:22,699
there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.

1008
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:26,010
That is not funny, Gordon.

1009
01:01:26,179 --> 01:01:28,840
Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.

1010
01:01:29,449 --> 01:01:31,579
I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.

1011
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,650
Of course, he was right, wasn't he?

1012
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:37,190
There is something wrong
with this country.

1013
01:01:53,269 --> 01:01:54,760
Morning, inspector.

1014
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,269
You're at it early.

1015
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:03,510
Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.

1016
01:02:11,789 --> 01:02:14,280
I wanna ask a question, Dominic.

1017
01:02:15,659 --> 01:02:18,030
I don't care if you answer me or not.

1018
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,190
I just wanna say this aloud.

1019
01:02:22,469 --> 01:02:26,230
But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.

1020
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,699
Yeah, of course, inspector, but...

1021
01:02:29,809 --> 01:02:31,210
Because of the terrorist?

1022
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:34,010
No.

1023
01:02:35,179 --> 01:02:38,280
So, what is it, chief? What's going on?

1024
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:44,550
The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's...

1025
01:02:45,489 --> 01:02:46,860
and Three Waters.

1026
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:53,429
The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours...

1027
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:56,400
the question I have to ask, is:

1028
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,800
What if the worst...

1029
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:05,070
the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history...

1030
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:09,010
was not the work
of religious extremists?

1031
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:12,849
Well, I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.

1032
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:15,150
And they were executed. I know.

1033
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,309
And maybe that's really what happened.

1034
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:23,250
But I see this chain of events...

1035
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:28,289
these coincidences,
and I have to ask:

1036
01:03:28,469 --> 01:03:33,059
What if that isn't what happened?
What if someone else unleashed that virus?

1037
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:37,300
What if someone else
killed all those people?

1038
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,769
Would you really wanna know
who it was?

1039
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,210
Sure.

1040
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,710
Even if it was someone
working for this government?

1041
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,210
That's my question.

1042
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,449
If our own government was responsible...

1043
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:55,920
for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...

1044
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:04,269
if our own government was responsible
for the deaths of almost 100,000 people...

1045
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:08,900
would you really wanna know?

1046
01:04:09,309 --> 01:04:11,539
This has to be the bloody coldest
March in years.

1047
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,110
Keep talking like that,
we'll lose our party status.

1048
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,132
They're a pack of
lying, greedy hypocrites!

1049
01:04:16,146 --> 01:04:18,010
Keep it down, will you?

1050
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,150
Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now...

1051
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:28,559
80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive.

1052
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,489
We're also showing
a 12-percent increase...

1053
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:35,119
over last month's positive mention
in all four quadrants.

1054
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,789
- Mr. Creedy?
- We're handling it as best we can.

1055
01:04:38,969 --> 01:04:41,630
Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.

1056
01:04:41,809 --> 01:04:44,280
I want more than arrests. I want results.

1057
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,670
- What's all this about?
- I'm celebrating.

1058
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:52,980
Celebrating what?

1059
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,179
I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.

1060
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,150
Very good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1061
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:02,619
Listen, we've got an extraordinary
show for you tonight.

1062
01:05:02,929 --> 01:05:06,190
You're not gonna believe it.
As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.

1063
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:08,860
Will you please give
a very warm welcome...

1064
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,440
to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler!

1065
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,500
- No way!
- No, it can't be!

1066
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:23,869
We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.

1067
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:25,639
Oh, my God.

1068
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:39,929
Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor...

1069
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:42,929
I understand you've been under
tremendous strain lately...

1070
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:46,230
since the beginning
of this whole terrorism business...

1071
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:50,500
and we thought it would be a nice idea
to try and help you relax. Girls?

1072
01:05:56,679 --> 01:05:59,949
Warm milk. There's nothing better.

1073
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:03,150
I understand you enjoy a glass
every night, chancellor.

1074
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,119
Since I was a boy.

1075
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:07,780
But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.

1076
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:09,913
The terrorist was never
a serious concern.

1077
01:06:09,925 --> 01:06:11,809
Oh, really?

1078
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,210
- Chancellor, chancellor...
- It's him.

1079
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,610
Are you saying that he's not still alive
and active?

1080
01:06:17,789 --> 01:06:20,449
The terrorist has been neutralized.

1081
01:06:22,119 --> 01:06:24,820
Oh, my God! Chancellor, look!

1082
01:06:24,989 --> 01:06:26,619
The terrorist!

1083
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,719
The terrorist!

1084
01:06:30,469 --> 01:06:32,159
Get him!

1085
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:36,699
Oh, dear.

1086
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,480
At last!

1087
01:06:57,659 --> 01:07:01,599
And now, for all the world to see.

1088
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,989
It's him!

1089
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:09,159
Unhand me! I am your chancellor!

1090
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:13,039
How dare you! I am the chancellor!

1091
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,280
Imposter!

1092
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:23,909
Soldiers! That man is the terrorist!

1093
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:27,019
- I order you to shoot that traitor!
- Liar!

1094
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:28,210
- Faker!
- Fraud!

1095
01:07:28,389 --> 01:07:30,260
- Ready!
- Aim!

1096
01:07:30,429 --> 01:07:31,889
- Fire!
- Fire!

1097
01:07:43,769 --> 01:07:45,760
What are they gonna do, fine us?

1098
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:49,400
Big deal. We've got
the most-watched show on air.

1099
01:07:49,579 --> 01:07:52,070
Well, you're my agent,
that's what I pay you for.

1100
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:54,110
Protect me.

1101
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,110
I should've hired him
to be my mother.

1102
01:07:56,289 --> 01:07:59,050
- You're mad.
- Either that or I wasn't breast-fed.

1103
01:07:59,219 --> 01:08:02,210
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Only the things that matter.

1104
01:08:02,389 --> 01:08:05,619
- What if they come after you?
- I tell you what's gonna happen.

1105
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:08,989
I'll have to make some kind of apology,
do some boring fundraiser.

1106
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:14,230
In the meantime, our ratings will go
through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.

1107
01:08:21,619 --> 01:08:22,850
Gordon?

1108
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:27,119
Quick, Evey, hide!

1109
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,439
Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?

1110
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:37,449
- Gotcha.
- No, no.

1111
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,039
Do you know why you're here,
Evey Hammond?

1112
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:56,539
Please.

1113
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,119
You've been charged
with three counts of murder...

1114
01:09:59,649 --> 01:10:03,140
the bombing of government property,
conspiracy to commit terrorism...

1115
01:10:03,319 --> 01:10:08,220
treason and sedition, the penalty
for which is death by firing squad.

1116
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:14,829
You have one chance,
and only one chance, to save your life.

1117
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,960
You must tell us the identity
or whereabouts...

1118
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,000
of code name V.

1119
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:24,300
If your information leads
to his capture...

1120
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:28,279
you will be released
from this facility immediately.

1121
01:10:28,449 --> 01:10:31,039
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

1122
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:34,310
You can return to your life,
Miss Hammond.

1123
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,819
All you have to do is cooperate.

1124
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,819
Process her.

1125
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:55,289
I know there's no way I can convince you
this is not one of their tricks...

1126
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:56,859
but I don't care.

1127
01:12:57,029 --> 01:12:58,829
I am me.

1128
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,729
My name is Valerie.

1129
01:13:00,899 --> 01:13:05,930
I don't think I'll live much longer,
and I wanted to tell someone about my life.

1130
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:10,510
This is the only autobiography
that I will ever write and, God...

1131
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:13,409
I'm writing it on toilet paper.

1132
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:19,079
I was born in Nottingham in 1985.

1133
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:24,050
I don't remember much of those early years,
but I do remember the rain.

1134
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,689
My grandmother owned a farm
in Tottle Brook...

1135
01:13:26,859 --> 01:13:29,729
and she used to tell me
that God was in the rain.

1136
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:32,659
I passed my 11 Plus
and went to girls' grammar.

1137
01:13:32,829 --> 01:13:35,560
It was at school
that I met my first girlfriend.

1138
01:13:35,729 --> 01:13:37,329
Her name was Sarah.

1139
01:13:37,939 --> 01:13:39,529
It was her wrists.

1140
01:13:39,699 --> 01:13:41,329
They were beautiful.

1141
01:13:43,979 --> 01:13:46,270
I thought we would
love each other forever.

1142
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:49,140
I remember our teacher telling us...

1143
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:52,010
that it was an adolescent phase
that people outgrew.

1144
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,739
Sarah did.

1145
01:13:55,289 --> 01:13:57,119
I didn't.

1146
01:13:57,319 --> 01:14:01,449
In 2002, I fell in love
with a girl named Christina.

1147
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:03,819
That year I came out to my parents.

1148
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,659
I couldn't have done it
without Chris holding my hand.

1149
01:14:07,829 --> 01:14:13,000
My father wouldn't look at me.
He told me to go and never come back.

1150
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,829
My mother said nothing.

1151
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:19,729
But I'd only told them the truth.
Was that so selfish?

1152
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:24,710
Our integrity sells for so little,
but it is all we really have.

1153
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,039
It is the very last inch of us.

1154
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:31,180
But within that inch...
we are free.

1155
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:35,520
It ends whenever you want it to.

1156
01:14:35,689 --> 01:14:38,289
- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.

1157
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:17,369
I'd always known
what I wanted to do with my life...

1158
01:15:17,539 --> 01:15:22,729
and in 2015 I starred in my first film,
The Salt Flats.

1159
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:27,699
It was the most important role of my life.
Not because of my career...

1160
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,869
but because that was how I met Ruth.

1161
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,810
The first time we kissed...

1162
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:38,750
I knew I never wanted to kiss
any other lips but hers again.

1163
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:48,029
We moved to a small flat
in London together.

1164
01:15:48,199 --> 01:15:50,720
She grew Scarlet Carsons for me
in our window box...

1165
01:15:51,739 --> 01:15:54,470
and our place always smelt of roses.

1166
01:15:56,369 --> 01:15:58,970
Those were the best years of my life.

1167
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:07,119
But America's war grew worse and worse,
and eventually came to London.

1168
01:16:07,289 --> 01:16:10,409
The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler...

1169
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:13,520
to close the remaining tube stations
passed with...

1170
01:16:13,689 --> 01:16:16,520
After that, there were no roses anymore.

1171
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:18,430
Not for anyone.

1172
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,689
You won't last much longer.

1173
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:22,529
You're gonna die here.

1174
01:16:22,699 --> 01:16:25,760
Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?

1175
01:16:36,609 --> 01:16:39,979
I remember how the meaning of words
began to change.

1176
01:16:41,189 --> 01:16:46,680
How unfamiliar words like "collateral"
and "rendition" became frightening...

1177
01:16:47,329 --> 01:16:52,130
while things like "Norsefire" and the
"Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.

1178
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,020
I remember how "different"
became dangerous.

1179
01:16:56,199 --> 01:16:58,729
I still don't understand it...

1180
01:16:58,899 --> 01:17:00,960
why they hate us so much.

1181
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:09,409
They took Ruth
while she was out buying food.

1182
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:14,710
I've never cried so hard in my life.

1183
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:18,479
It wasn't long till they came for me.

1184
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:30,319
It seems strange that my life should end
in such a terrible place.

1185
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:35,909
But for three years,
I had roses and apologized to no one.

1186
01:17:38,739 --> 01:17:40,340
I shall die here.

1187
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:44,039
Every inch of me shall perish.

1188
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,909
Every inch...

1189
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,779
but one.

1190
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,579
An inch.

1191
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:56,920
It is small, and it is fragile...

1192
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,789
and it is the only thing
in the world worth having.

1193
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:06,060
We must never lose it or give it away.
We must never let them take it from us.

1194
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:11,210
I hope that, whoever you are,
you escape this place.

1195
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:14,569
I hope that the world turns
and that things get better.

1196
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:19,680
But what I hope most of all
is that you understand what I mean...

1197
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:23,050
when I tell you that
even though I do not know you...

1198
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:25,949
and even though
I may never meet you...

1199
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:29,390
laugh with you, cry with you...

1200
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,489
or kiss you...

1201
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:33,760
I love you.

1202
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:36,460
With all my heart...

1203
01:18:36,729 --> 01:18:38,670
I love you.

1204
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:41,739
Valerie.

1205
01:18:54,449 --> 01:18:59,189
I'm instructed to inform you that you
have been convicted by special tribunal...

1206
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:04,319
and that unless you are ready to offer
your cooperation, you are to be executed.

1207
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:08,260
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

1208
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:12,100
- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?

1209
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:18,170
- No.
- Very well.

1210
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:23,010
Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell.

1211
01:19:24,149 --> 01:19:25,640
Arrange a detail of six men...

1212
01:19:25,819 --> 01:19:28,789
and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her.

1213
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:46,029
It's time.

1214
01:19:47,739 --> 01:19:49,140
I'm ready.

1215
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:53,569
Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.

1216
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,010
Just give them something, anything.

1217
01:19:56,949 --> 01:19:58,380
Thank you...

1218
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:01,539
but I'd rather die
behind the chemical sheds.

1219
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:06,020
Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.

1220
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:13,359
What?

1221
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:39,109
Hello, Evey.

1222
01:21:40,689 --> 01:21:41,949
You.

1223
01:21:44,119 --> 01:21:46,949
- It was you?
- Yeah.

1224
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:49,050
That wasn't real?

1225
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:55,489
- Is Gordon...?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.

1226
01:21:55,699 --> 01:21:57,100
I thought they'd arrest him...

1227
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:00,529
but when they found a Koran
in his house, they had him executed.

1228
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:02,699
Oh, God.

1229
01:22:03,369 --> 01:22:05,143
Fortunately, I got to
you before they did.

1230
01:22:05,155 --> 01:22:06,939
You got to me?

1231
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,510
You did this to me?

1232
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:13,550
You cut my hair?

1233
01:22:15,189 --> 01:22:16,479
You tortured me?

1234
01:22:17,319 --> 01:22:19,149
You tortured me.

1235
01:22:20,689 --> 01:22:21,920
Why?

1236
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:27,529
You said you wanted to live without fear.
I wish there'd been an easier way...

1237
01:22:27,699 --> 01:22:29,760
but there wasn't. Oh, my God.

1238
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:31,829
I know you may never forgive me...

1239
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:35,069
but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me.

1240
01:22:35,239 --> 01:22:38,300
Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.

1241
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:40,869
Every day, I wanted to end it.

1242
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:44,640
But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.

1243
01:22:44,819 --> 01:22:47,550
You're sick! You're evil!

1244
01:22:48,189 --> 01:22:51,180
You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.

1245
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:54,319
- Why?
- Leave me alone! I hate you!

1246
01:22:54,529 --> 01:22:58,050
That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.

1247
01:22:58,229 --> 01:23:00,789
Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me...

1248
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:03,460
taught me how to eat,
how to drink, how to breathe.

1249
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:07,199
I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.

1250
01:23:07,369 --> 01:23:09,310
But then something happened.

1251
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:11,869
It happened to me
just as it happened to you.

1252
01:23:12,039 --> 01:23:14,909
Shut up! I don't want to hear your lies!

1253
01:23:15,079 --> 01:23:18,850
Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.

1254
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:20,779
Yes, I created a lie.

1255
01:23:20,949 --> 01:23:24,550
But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.

1256
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:28,119
- No.
- What was true in that cell is true now.

1257
01:23:28,289 --> 01:23:31,350
What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.

1258
01:23:31,529 --> 01:23:34,119
I can't feel anything anymore!

1259
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:38,029
Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.

1260
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:41,000
I can't... Can't breathe.

1261
01:23:41,539 --> 01:23:45,869
Asthma. When I was little...

1262
01:23:47,949 --> 01:23:49,539
Listen to me, Evey.

1263
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:53,310
This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.

1264
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:58,909
They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.

1265
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:04,949
They put you in a cell and took everything
they could take except your life.

1266
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:08,029
And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?

1267
01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:10,930
The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.

1268
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:14,770
- Oh, please.
- You found something else.

1269
01:24:14,939 --> 01:24:18,770
In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.

1270
01:24:18,939 --> 01:24:22,279
When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave what they wanted...

1271
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:25,310
you told them you'd rather die.

1272
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,409
You faced your death, Evey.

1273
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:30,550
You were calm. You were still.

1274
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,119
Try to feel now what you felt then.

1275
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,260
Oh, God.

1276
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:45,100
I felt...

1277
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:47,199
Yes?

1278
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:50,970
I'm dizzy.

1279
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:53,239
I need air.

1280
01:24:53,409 --> 01:24:56,640
Please, I need to be outside.

1281
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:58,869
There's a lift.
It'll take us to the roof.

1282
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:18,939
God is in the rain.

1283
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:25,130
V.

1284
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:27,640
I'm leaving.

1285
01:26:30,069 --> 01:26:33,640
There are 872 songs in here.

1286
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:37,710
I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.

1287
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:41,010
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

1288
01:26:41,189 --> 01:26:42,649
I can't stay here.

1289
01:26:44,189 --> 01:26:45,710
I know.

1290
01:26:46,989 --> 01:26:50,430
Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.

1291
01:26:51,399 --> 01:26:53,560
I thought about keeping this...

1292
01:26:53,729 --> 01:26:57,220
but it didn't seem right,
knowing you wrote it.

1293
01:27:03,239 --> 01:27:04,670
I didn't.

1294
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:08,899
May I show you something
before you go?

1295
01:27:19,659 --> 01:27:22,250
- She was real.
- Yes.

1296
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:24,159
She's beautiful.

1297
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:27,460
- Did you know her?
- No.

1298
01:27:27,829 --> 01:27:30,300
She wrote the letter
just before she died.

1299
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:33,329
And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.

1300
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:35,430
Then it really happened, didn't it?

1301
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:38,670
- Yes.
- You were in the cell next to her.

1302
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:43,869
And that's what this is all about.

1303
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:47,140
You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.

1304
01:27:47,789 --> 01:27:51,020
- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.

1305
01:27:51,189 --> 01:27:53,090
It's a basic principle of the universe...

1306
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:56,189
that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.

1307
01:27:56,359 --> 01:27:57,760
Is that how you see it?

1308
01:27:57,930 --> 01:28:00,399
- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.

1309
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,619
And they created a monster.

1310
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:16,300
- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.

1311
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:19,979
That would have scared me before...

1312
01:28:20,149 --> 01:28:21,850
but I suppose I should thank you.

1313
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:35,060
Thank you.

1314
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,189
Goodbye.

1315
01:28:41,369 --> 01:28:43,069
Evey...

1316
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:47,039
may I ask you for something?

1317
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:52,010
If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once...

1318
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:53,909
before the 5th.

1319
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:58,819
- All right.
- Thank you.

1320
01:29:20,979 --> 01:29:23,779
Chancellor, I know no one seems
to want to discuss this...

1321
01:29:23,949 --> 01:29:26,380
but if we're to be prepared
for any eventuality...

1322
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:29,449
then it can't be ignored any longer.

1323
01:29:29,619 --> 01:29:34,149
The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.

1324
01:29:34,329 --> 01:29:35,760
Now, it concludes that...

1325
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:39,329
the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use...

1326
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,899
would be an airborne attack.

1327
01:29:42,069 --> 01:29:43,689
A separate report has been filed...

1328
01:29:43,869 --> 01:29:47,699
suggesting a train, despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament...

1329
01:29:47,869 --> 01:29:49,430
have been sealed shut.

1330
01:29:49,609 --> 01:29:51,569
Who filed that report?

1331
01:29:52,739 --> 01:29:54,300
Chief Inspector Finch.

1332
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:57,380
Do you have any evidence
to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?

1333
01:29:57,579 --> 01:30:00,109
No, sir. Just a feeling.

1334
01:30:00,279 --> 01:30:02,250
If I am sure of anything, inspector...

1335
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:06,579
it is that this government will not survive
if it is to be subject to your feelings.

1336
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:09,689
Mr. Dascomb,
what we need right now...

1337
01:30:09,859 --> 01:30:12,920
is a clear message
to the people of this country.

1338
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,430
This message must be read
in every newspaper...

1339
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,119
heard on every radio,
seen on every television.

1340
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,329
This message must resound
throughout the entire interlink!

1341
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:25,909
I want this country to realize
that we stand on the edge of oblivion.

1342
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:30,340
I want every man, woman and child
to understand how close we are to chaos.

1343
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:32,449
I want everyone...

1344
01:30:32,649 --> 01:30:36,350
to remember why they need us!

1345
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:41,050
In the former United States, civil war
continues to devastate the Midwest.

1346
01:30:41,229 --> 01:30:45,529
Scientists attribute this water shortage
to the lack of rainfall the last two years.

1347
01:30:45,699 --> 01:30:48,819
Ministry officials expect
water coupon prices to rise.

1348
01:30:49,029 --> 01:30:50,970
Police have arrested nine suspects...

1349
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:54,899
Can you believe this shit?
Been going on all summer.

1350
01:30:55,069 --> 01:30:59,029
Outside the quarantine zone, a new
airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.

1351
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:03,539
Authorities uncovered new evidence linking
the terrorist organization called V...

1352
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:08,020
to the St. Mary's viral attack
on London 14 years ago.

1353
01:31:20,029 --> 01:31:22,560
My friend inside the Finger
came up with something.

1354
01:31:22,899 --> 01:31:24,630
There were three men.

1355
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,600
Covert intel.

1356
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:29,029
Original black-baggers, all under Creedy.

1357
01:31:30,069 --> 01:31:33,909
Alan Percy, Robert Keyes,
William Rookwood.

1358
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:36,170
The day after
the St. Mary's outbreak...

1359
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:39,750
Percy gives his Beretta a blowjob,
Keyes dies in a fire...

1360
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,409
Rookwood goes missing.

1361
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:44,520
Bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach.

1362
01:31:44,689 --> 01:31:46,449
Rookwood.

1363
01:31:46,619 --> 01:31:48,449
How do I know that name?

1364
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:58,659
Shit. He must have had a hidden trip
on his file at the Finger.

1365
01:31:58,869 --> 01:32:01,100
But how'd he know it was you?

1366
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:04,229
What do we do?

1367
01:32:05,439 --> 01:32:08,239
I'm a cop. I have to know.

1368
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:20,050
I came when they opened it.
It gave me the collywobbles.

1369
01:32:21,729 --> 01:32:23,350
Still does.

1370
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,600
That's close enough, inspector.

1371
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:38,399
We're not wired.

1372
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:42,939
I'm sorry, but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution.

1373
01:32:43,109 --> 01:32:46,380
- You have information for us?
- No, you already have the information.

1374
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:48,609
All the names and dates
are inside your head.

1375
01:32:48,789 --> 01:32:51,250
What you want,
what you really need, is a story.

1376
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,409
A story can be true or false.

1377
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:57,119
I leave such judgments to you, inspector.

1378
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:01,399
Our story begins,
as these stories often do...

1379
01:33:01,569 --> 01:33:04,689
with a young,
up-and-coming politician.

1380
01:33:04,869 --> 01:33:08,829
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

1381
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:13,380
He's completely single-minded and has
no regard for the political process.

1382
01:33:13,539 --> 01:33:16,710
The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry...

1383
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,470
and the more aggressive
his supporters become.

1384
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:25,479
Eventually, his party launches a special
project in the name of national security.

1385
01:33:25,689 --> 01:33:29,060
At first it's believed to be a search
for biological weapons...

1386
01:33:29,229 --> 01:33:31,989
and it's pursued without regard
to its cost.

1387
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:35,890
However, the true goal
of this project is power.

1388
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:38,829
Complete and total
hegemonic domination.

1389
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,560
The project, however, ends violently.

1390
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:45,529
But the efforts of those involved
are not in vain...

1391
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:50,739
for a new ability to wage war is born
from the blood of one of the victims.

1392
01:33:50,909 --> 01:33:54,510
Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can...

1393
01:33:54,689 --> 01:33:57,710
and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.

1394
01:33:57,890 --> 01:34:02,789
But if your ultimate goal is power,
how best to use such a weapon?

1395
01:34:02,989 --> 01:34:06,590
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.

1396
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:09,260
A man seemingly
without a conscience...

1397
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:11,699
for whom the ends
always justify the means.

1398
01:34:11,869 --> 01:34:15,460
He suggests that their target
should not be an enemy of the country...

1399
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,500
but rather, the country itself.

1400
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:20,909
Three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack:

1401
01:34:21,079 --> 01:34:24,069
A school, a tube station
and a water-treatment plant.

1402
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:26,840
Several hundred die
within the first few weeks.

1403
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:29,350
Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated.

1404
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:32,180
Authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread.

1405
01:34:32,359 --> 01:34:34,350
Sent destruction
through the Underground.

1406
01:34:35,789 --> 01:34:38,390
Fueled by the media,
fear and panic spread quickly...

1407
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:43,800
fracturing and dividing the country until,
at last, the true goal comes into view.

1408
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:45,399
Before the St. Mary's crises...

1409
01:34:45,569 --> 01:34:49,770
no one would have predicted the results
of the election that year. No one.

1410
01:34:49,939 --> 01:34:54,399
And then not long after the election,
lo and behold, a miracle.

1411
01:34:54,579 --> 01:34:57,100
Some believed it was the work
of God himself.

1412
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:01,050
But it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members...

1413
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:04,449
that made them all obscenely rich.

1414
01:35:04,659 --> 01:35:08,789
A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed...

1415
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:12,260
while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims.

1416
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:18,060
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.

1417
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,569
Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.

1418
01:35:20,739 --> 01:35:23,369
Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed...

1419
01:35:23,539 --> 01:35:27,500
to the newly created position
of high chancellor.

1420
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,270
The rest, as they say, is history.

1421
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:36,350
- Can you prove any of this?
- Why do you think I'm still alive?

1422
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:42,859
All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.

1423
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:44,890
I'm sure you would.

1424
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:49,970
But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.

1425
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:53,100
Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.

1426
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:56,140
When I feel safe he can't pick his nose
without you knowing...

1427
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:57,770
I'll contact you again.

1428
01:35:57,939 --> 01:36:00,210
Till then, cheerio.

1429
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,210
Rookwood...

1430
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,710
why didn't you come forward before?

1431
01:36:07,779 --> 01:36:09,149
What were you waiting for?

1432
01:36:09,319 --> 01:36:11,510
Well, for you, inspector.

1433
01:36:11,689 --> 01:36:13,489
I needed you.

1434
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,840
What's he doing in the dark there?

1435
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:45,539
Creepy Creedy. Not sure I wanna know.

1436
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:49,319
Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?

1437
01:36:49,489 --> 01:36:51,649
And we both know why.

1438
01:36:52,329 --> 01:36:54,699
After I destroy Parliament...

1439
01:36:54,869 --> 01:36:58,770
his only chance will be to offer them
someone else, some other piece of meat.

1440
01:36:58,939 --> 01:37:00,159
And who will that be?

1441
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:02,569
You, Mr. Creedy.

1442
01:37:02,739 --> 01:37:06,229
A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.

1443
01:37:06,409 --> 01:37:10,210
A man as smart as you
probably has a plan.

1444
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:13,539
That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.

1445
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:16,210
It's the reason why
you're being watched right now...

1446
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:19,180
why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house...

1447
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:21,920
and a tap on every phone.
Bollocks.

1448
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:26,529
Oh, a man as smart as you, I think,
knows otherwise.

1449
01:37:26,699 --> 01:37:29,689
- What do you want?
- Sutler.

1450
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:33,859
Come, now, Mr. Creedy,
you knew this was coming.

1451
01:37:34,039 --> 01:37:36,029
You knew that one day
it'd be you or him.

1452
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:39,539
That's why Sutler's been kept
underground for security purposes.

1453
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:42,869
That's why there are several
of your men close to Sutler...

1454
01:37:43,050 --> 01:37:46,850
men that can be counted on.
All you have to do is say the word.

1455
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:49,920
- What do I get out of this deal?
- Me.

1456
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,920
If you accept,
put an X on your front door.

1457
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:58,960
Why should I trust you?

1458
01:37:59,159 --> 01:38:02,329
Because it's the only way
you're ever going to stop me.

1459
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:13,770
It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.

1460
01:38:15,579 --> 01:38:16,979
May we come up?

1461
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:20,579
You find your own tree.

1462
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:34,489
We got Creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks.

1463
01:38:35,170 --> 01:38:37,529
Still no word. What's he waiting for?

1464
01:38:40,699 --> 01:38:43,140
Yeah? Inspector, it's for you.

1465
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:47,779
- Yeah.
- Is that Chief Inspector Finch?

1466
01:38:47,939 --> 01:38:49,739
- It is.
- This is Captain Clark...

1467
01:38:49,909 --> 01:38:52,010
of the 137th Ward at South end.

1468
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:53,409
- We found him.
- Found who?

1469
01:38:53,579 --> 01:38:55,640
William Rookwood,
the one you're looking for.

1470
01:38:55,819 --> 01:38:59,619
I saw your report a couple weeks back,
thought I'd run it through our John Does.

1471
01:38:59,789 --> 01:39:01,689
I hooked him. Perfect dental match.

1472
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:05,789
A floater. Fishermen picked him up.
No ID, never solved. Till now, that is.

1473
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:09,729
- William Rookwood is dead?
- I'd say so. Twenty years now.

1474
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:14,460
Goddamn it!

1475
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:17,140
That son of a bitch sat there...

1476
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:21,000
and spoon-fed me that bullshit,
and I ate it up!

1477
01:39:21,909 --> 01:39:23,850
So, what do we do now, inspector?

1478
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:26,380
We do what we should have been doing.

1479
01:39:27,149 --> 01:39:28,479
We find him.

1480
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:53,109
Every day, gentlemen.

1481
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:57,300
Every day that brings us closer
to November...

1482
01:39:57,479 --> 01:40:00,210
every day that man remains free...

1483
01:40:00,579 --> 01:40:03,079
is one more failure.

1484
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:05,689
Three hundred and forty-seven days,
gentlemen.

1485
01:40:05,859 --> 01:40:08,260
Three hundred and forty-seven failures!

1486
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:11,119
Chancellor, we do not have
the adequate force...

1487
01:40:11,289 --> 01:40:17,260
We are being buried beneath the avalanche
of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy!

1488
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:35,979
I'll get it.

1489
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:39,649
- Eric Finch?
- Yeah.

1490
01:40:44,529 --> 01:40:45,760
Bloody hell.

1491
01:40:47,529 --> 01:40:49,159
How many went out?

1492
01:40:49,329 --> 01:40:51,029
So far we count eight boxcars.

1493
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:54,000
- Several hundred thousand, at least.
- Christ.

1494
01:40:55,569 --> 01:40:59,630
I want anyone caught
with one of those masks arrested!

1495
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:02,609
Give me the money!
Give me the fucking money!

1496
01:41:02,779 --> 01:41:05,770
We're under siege here.
The whole city's gone mad.

1497
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,920
- This is exactly what he wants.
- What?

1498
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:12,779
- Anarchy in the UK!
- Chaos.

1499
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:18,189
Mr. Creedy, I am holding you
personally responsible for this situation.

1500
01:41:20,630 --> 01:41:25,029
The problem is that he knows us
better than we know ourselves.

1501
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:29,930
That's why I went to Larkhill
last night.

1502
01:41:30,109 --> 01:41:33,539
- That's outside quarantine.
- I had to see it.

1503
01:41:35,210 --> 01:41:36,840
There wasn't much left.

1504
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:40,979
But when I was there, it was strange.

1505
01:41:41,149 --> 01:41:44,810
I suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected.

1506
01:41:50,489 --> 01:41:52,119
Like I could see the whole thing.

1507
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:57,329
One long chain of events that stretched
all the way back before Larkhill.

1508
01:41:59,369 --> 01:42:02,699
I felt like I could see everything
that had happened...

1509
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:10,810
and everything that
was going to happen.

1510
01:42:11,479 --> 01:42:13,010
Hey, you!

1511
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:19,350
It was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me...

1512
01:42:20,689 --> 01:42:23,180
and I realized that
we were all a part of it...

1513
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,590
and all trapped by it.

1514
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:38,840
So do you know what's gonna happen?

1515
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:42,699
No. It was a feeling.

1516
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:46,340
But I can guess.

1517
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:51,850
With so much chaos,
someone will do something stupid.

1518
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:59,859
And when they do...
things will turn nasty.

1519
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:16,170
Rioters were arrested in Brixton.

1520
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:20,819
And then Sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do.

1521
01:43:23,989 --> 01:43:29,319
At which point,
all V needs to do is keep his word.

1522
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:31,920
And then...

1523
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:38,789
Tonight's your big night.

1524
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:41,489
You ready for it?

1525
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:45,890
Are we ready for it?

1526
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:20,760
I missed this song.

1527
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:23,729
I didn't think you'd come.

1528
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:26,239
I said I would.

1529
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:31,770
You look well.

1530
01:45:31,949 --> 01:45:33,380
Thank you.

1531
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:39,550
May I inquire as to how
you've avoided detection?

1532
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:42,689
A fake ID works better
than a Guy Fawkes mask.

1533
01:45:44,289 --> 01:45:48,229
I must confess, every time I heard a siren,
I worried about you.

1534
01:45:48,399 --> 01:45:51,729
I worried about myself for a while.

1535
01:45:51,899 --> 01:45:54,670
But then, one day, I was at a market...

1536
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:58,899
and a friend, someone I had worked
with at the BTN, got in line behind me.

1537
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:04,239
I was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money, I dropped it.

1538
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,880
My friend picked it up...

1539
01:46:08,050 --> 01:46:10,109
and handed it to me.

1540
01:46:10,819 --> 01:46:13,189
She looked at me right in the eyes...

1541
01:46:14,189 --> 01:46:16,060
didn't recognize me.

1542
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:21,449
Whatever you did to me worked better
than I'd have imagined.

1543
01:46:27,439 --> 01:46:29,960
I have a gift for you, Evey...

1544
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:35,130
but before I give it to you,
I'd like to ask you something.

1545
01:46:35,310 --> 01:46:38,279
Would you dance with me?

1546
01:46:39,319 --> 01:46:42,810
Now? On the eve of your revolution?

1547
01:46:42,989 --> 01:46:46,479
A revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having.

1548
01:46:48,090 --> 01:46:49,319
I'd love to.

1549
01:46:50,789 --> 01:46:53,920
Tonight, I will speak directly
to these people...

1550
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:56,529
and make the situation
perfectly clear to them.

1551
01:46:56,699 --> 01:47:02,260
The security of this nation depends
on complete and total compliance.

1552
01:47:02,439 --> 01:47:06,970
Tonight, any protestor,
any instigator or agitator...

1553
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:09,869
will be made example of!

1554
01:47:12,149 --> 01:47:15,119
Chancellor, there is a contingency
that has not been addressed.

1555
01:47:15,279 --> 01:47:17,119
And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?

1556
01:47:17,289 --> 01:47:19,479
- Should the terrorist succeed...
- He won't.

1557
01:47:19,659 --> 01:47:23,180
I understand that it is highly unlikely,
but if he does...

1558
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:27,130
If he does, and something happens
to that building...

1559
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:30,560
the only thing that will change,
the only difference it will make...

1560
01:47:30,729 --> 01:47:33,460
is that tomorrow morning,
instead of a newspaper...

1561
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:37,500
I will be reading
Mr. Creedy's resignation!

1562
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:46,479
You've been busy.
They're very scared right now.

1563
01:47:46,649 --> 01:47:50,710
I heard Sutler's going to make
a public statement tonight.

1564
01:47:50,890 --> 01:47:52,579
It's nearly time.

1565
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:55,420
The masks were ingenious.

1566
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:58,420
It was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere.

1567
01:47:58,590 --> 01:48:01,689
Conceal me what I am,
and be my aid...

1568
01:48:01,859 --> 01:48:05,229
for such disguise as haply shall become
the form of my intent.

1569
01:48:05,399 --> 01:48:08,270
- Twelfth Night.
- Viola.

1570
01:48:08,439 --> 01:48:11,170
- I don't understand.
- What?

1571
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:14,739
How you can be one of the most important
things that has happened to me...

1572
01:48:14,909 --> 01:48:17,350
and yet I know
almost nothing about you.

1573
01:48:17,510 --> 01:48:20,310
I don't know where you were born,
who your parents were...

1574
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:22,920
if you had any brothers or sisters.

1575
01:48:23,090 --> 01:48:26,210
I don't even know
what you really look like.

1576
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:28,409
Evey, please.

1577
01:48:29,659 --> 01:48:31,850
There is a face beneath this mask...

1578
01:48:32,029 --> 01:48:33,859
but it's not me.

1579
01:48:34,029 --> 01:48:37,399
I'm no more that face than I am
the muscles beneath it...

1580
01:48:37,569 --> 01:48:39,229
or the bones beneath them.

1581
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:42,699
I understand.

1582
01:48:43,909 --> 01:48:45,500
Thank you.

1583
01:48:46,239 --> 01:48:48,010
There isn't much time.

1584
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:50,369
I have something I must give you.

1585
01:48:50,649 --> 01:48:52,710
I went by Parliament.

1586
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:57,720
Never seen anything like it.
Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.

1587
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:01,520
Makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight.

1588
01:49:03,489 --> 01:49:06,119
But if they do,
what do you think will happen?

1589
01:49:06,899 --> 01:49:09,460
What usually happens
when people without guns...

1590
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:12,329
stand up to people with guns.

1591
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,630
Pull over here.

1592
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,300
We've searched these tunnels for weeks.
You think you're gonna find him now?

1593
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:23,109
Inspector.

1594
01:49:23,909 --> 01:49:25,779
It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?

1595
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:38,390
The Underground?
I thought they closed this all down.

1596
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:39,789
They did.

1597
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:43,760
It took nearly 10 years to clear the tracks
and lay a bit of my own.

1598
01:49:45,739 --> 01:49:47,260
Let me show you.

1599
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:05,279
These tracks lead to Parliament.

1600
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:06,989
Yes.

1601
01:50:07,689 --> 01:50:09,680
Then it's really going to happen, isn't it?

1602
01:50:09,859 --> 01:50:13,159
It will if you want it to.

1603
01:50:13,659 --> 01:50:15,789
- What?
- This is my gift to you, Evey.

1604
01:50:16,369 --> 01:50:21,829
Everything that I have: My home,
my books, the gallery, this train...

1605
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,970
I'm leaving to you to do with
what you will.

1606
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:26,539
Is this another trick, V?

1607
01:50:26,710 --> 01:50:31,079
No. No more tricks. No more lies.

1608
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:33,149
Only truth.

1609
01:50:33,319 --> 01:50:36,479
And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong...

1610
01:50:36,989 --> 01:50:41,890
that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.

1611
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:44,859
- Why?
- Because this world...

1612
01:50:45,029 --> 01:50:49,489
the world that I'm a part of and
that I helped shape, will end tonight.

1613
01:50:50,529 --> 01:50:52,560
And tomorrow,
a different world will begin...

1614
01:50:52,739 --> 01:50:57,829
that different people will shape,
and this choice belongs to them.

1615
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,779
Where are you going?

1616
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:05,340
The time has come for me
to meet my maker...

1617
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:08,850
and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.

1618
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:11,779
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.

1619
01:51:11,949 --> 01:51:14,510
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.

1620
01:51:14,689 --> 01:51:17,659
No. You were right about what I am.

1621
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:20,090
I have no tree waiting for me.

1622
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:25,060
All I want, all I deserve,
is at the end of that tunnel.

1623
01:51:25,229 --> 01:51:27,000
That's not true.

1624
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,960
I can't.

1625
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:05,670
My fellow Englishmen...

1626
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:08,229
tonight, our country...

1627
01:52:08,409 --> 01:52:09,939
that which we stand for...

1628
01:52:10,149 --> 01:52:11,739
and all that we hold dear...

1629
01:52:11,909 --> 01:52:15,680
faces a grave and terrible threat.

1630
01:52:15,850 --> 01:52:17,319
The area's clean, sir.

1631
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,689
This violent and unparalleled assault
to our security...

1632
01:52:21,859 --> 01:52:23,619
will not go undefended.

1633
01:52:23,789 --> 01:52:25,090
Where is he?

1634
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:26,250
Or unpunished.

1635
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:28,590
Penny for the Guy.

1636
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:32,760
Our enemy is an insidious one,
seeking to divide us...

1637
01:52:33,369 --> 01:52:37,810
and destroy the very foundation
of our great nation.

1638
01:52:37,970 --> 01:52:42,029
I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?

1639
01:52:42,210 --> 01:52:43,369
Bring him down.

1640
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:45,779
Tonight we must remain steadfast.

1641
01:52:46,279 --> 01:52:48,109
We must remain determined.

1642
01:52:48,279 --> 01:52:51,479
But most of all,
we must remain united.

1643
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:58,390
Those caught tonight
in violation of curfew...

1644
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:01,189
will be considered in league
with our enemy...

1645
01:53:01,359 --> 01:53:04,630
and prosecuted as a terrorist
without leniency or exception.

1646
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,289
I want to see his face.

1647
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:09,930
Tonight I give you
my most solemn vow...

1648
01:53:10,109 --> 01:53:12,510
that justice will be swift...

1649
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:15,140
it will be righteous...

1650
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:17,579
and it will be without mercy.

1651
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:21,909
Oh, God. No.

1652
01:53:22,079 --> 01:53:25,989
At last, we finally meet.

1653
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,890
I have something for you, chancellor.

1654
01:53:31,159 --> 01:53:32,960
A farewell gift.

1655
01:53:33,130 --> 01:53:36,720
For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done...

1656
01:53:36,899 --> 01:53:38,920
and for the only thing you have left.

1657
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:43,199
Goodbye, chancellor.

1658
01:53:44,210 --> 01:53:45,399
Mr. Creedy.

1659
01:53:47,779 --> 01:53:49,539
Disgusting.

1660
01:54:02,319 --> 01:54:04,449
Now that's done with...

1661
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:08,460
it's time to have a look at your face.

1662
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,520
Take off your mask.

1663
01:54:10,829 --> 01:54:12,060
No.

1664
01:54:27,479 --> 01:54:29,109
Defiant to the end, huh?

1665
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:34,680
You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.

1666
01:54:34,859 --> 01:54:35,979
You're like me.

1667
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:40,600
The only thing you and I have in common,
Mr. Creedy, is we're both about to die.

1668
01:54:42,229 --> 01:54:43,989
How do you imagine
that's gonna happen?

1669
01:54:44,270 --> 01:54:46,460
With my hands around your neck.

1670
01:54:48,739 --> 01:54:49,859
Bollocks.

1671
01:54:50,970 --> 01:54:53,199
What are you gonna do, huh?

1672
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:55,470
We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.

1673
01:54:55,640 --> 01:55:00,050
Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.

1674
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:01,770
We have guns.

1675
01:55:01,949 --> 01:55:05,220
No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty...

1676
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:07,510
I'm no longer standing,
because if I am...

1677
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:10,449
you'll all be dead
before you've reloaded.

1678
01:55:10,789 --> 01:55:12,949
That's impossible!

1679
01:55:15,359 --> 01:55:16,420
Kill him.

1680
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:42,180
My turn.

1681
01:56:53,859 --> 01:56:56,060
Die! Die!

1682
01:56:56,970 --> 01:56:59,130
Why won't you die?!

1683
01:57:00,069 --> 01:57:01,430
Why won't you die?

1684
01:57:03,310 --> 01:57:06,399
Beneath this mask
there is more than flesh.

1685
01:57:06,579 --> 01:57:09,369
Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.

1686
01:57:10,750 --> 01:57:12,939
And ideas are bulletproof.

1687
01:58:04,670 --> 01:58:07,760
This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.

1688
01:58:07,939 --> 01:58:09,199
This is General Ackroyd.

1689
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:11,159
Keep communication tight.

1690
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:14,609
I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.

1691
01:58:18,510 --> 01:58:19,850
V!

1692
01:58:24,489 --> 01:58:27,010
Oh, God, we have to stop your bleeding.

1693
01:58:27,189 --> 01:58:31,319
Please, don't. I'm finished and glad of it.

1694
01:58:31,729 --> 01:58:33,319
Don't say that.

1695
01:58:33,829 --> 01:58:36,699
I told you, only truth.

1696
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:43,670
For 20 years I sought only this day.

1697
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:45,970
Nothing else existed...

1698
01:58:48,039 --> 01:58:50,029
until I saw you.

1699
01:58:51,210 --> 01:58:53,479
Then everything changed.

1700
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,819
I fell in love with you, Evey...

1701
01:58:58,390 --> 01:59:01,579
like I no longer believed I could.

1702
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:04,229
V, I don't want you to die.

1703
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,760
That's the most beautiful thing...

1704
01:59:10,930 --> 01:59:13,529
you could have ever given me.

1705
01:59:21,079 --> 01:59:22,539
V?

1706
01:59:23,779 --> 01:59:25,039
V?!

1707
01:59:35,489 --> 01:59:38,460
Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading to Trafalgar Square.

1708
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:40,649
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.

1709
02:00:12,899 --> 02:00:14,989
Hold it. Stop right there.

1710
02:00:18,399 --> 02:00:19,890
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?

1711
02:00:27,909 --> 02:00:29,170
Then it's over?

1712
02:00:29,649 --> 02:00:30,869
Almost.

1713
02:00:31,050 --> 02:00:33,479
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.

1714
02:00:35,850 --> 02:00:36,909
No.

1715
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:40,090
Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.

1716
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,489
- What shall we do?
- No response from Command.

1717
02:00:43,930 --> 02:00:46,260
Or from Party Leader Creedy.

1718
02:00:46,430 --> 02:00:47,729
Or from the high chancellor.

1719
02:00:48,630 --> 02:00:49,859
Why are you doing this?

1720
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:52,770
- Because he was right.
- About what?

1721
02:00:52,939 --> 02:00:57,430
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.

1722
02:01:02,479 --> 02:01:04,970
Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!

1723
02:01:31,770 --> 02:01:34,170
Jesus bloody Christ.

1724
02:01:59,470 --> 02:02:00,560
It's time.

1725
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:23,250
Tell me...

1726
02:02:24,289 --> 02:02:26,779
do you like music, Mr. Finch?

1727
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:48,369
That music?

1728
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,319
Yes.

1729
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:52,310
His music.

1730
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:25,810
Who was he?

1731
02:03:27,090 --> 02:03:28,319
He was Edmond Dantes.

1732
02:03:30,489 --> 02:03:35,000
And he was my father...
and my mother.

1733
02:03:35,899 --> 02:03:37,329
My brother.

1734
02:03:39,329 --> 02:03:41,199
My friend.

1735
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:44,130
He was you...

1736
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:47,680
and me.

1737
02:03:49,779 --> 02:03:51,640
He was all of us.

1738
02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:23,539
No one will ever forget that night...

1739
02:04:23,710 --> 02:04:26,369
and what it meant for this country.

1740
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:29,319
But I will never forget the man...

1741
02:04:29,479 --> 02:04:31,149
and what he meant to me.
