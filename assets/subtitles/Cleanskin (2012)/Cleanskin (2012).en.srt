1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,961
Iraq has increased
the level of its oil reserves

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,522
by 24% since Saddam Hussein
was removed.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,768
The country has 133.1 billion barrels

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,330
of extractable oil

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,400
up from 115 billion barrels
estimated previously.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,369
- Under Saddam Hussein...
- Fucking bitch!

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,886
- political isolation meant
little new exploratory work

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,007
was undertaken.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,722
Closer to home, with the government
way ahead in the opinion polls,

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,883
the focus of debate in
the upcoming general election today

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,885
switched from the economy
to the domestic terror threat.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,123
The government claims
that domestic terror groups

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,441
fractured since
Osama Bin Laden's death,

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,887
and due to increased cooperation
with key Middle...

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,405
Unbelievable!

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,968
People have no idea about
the shit storm that's about to go down.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,481
Is this thing real?

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,607
Don't play with it.

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,325
Have I lost weight?

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,243
Was gonna say you look different.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,641
I've lost weight. I mean, I feel good.

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,490
It's 50 short.

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,401
Get her out of here.

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,363
What about my money?

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,283
Get your hands off me.

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,130
Don't touch me!

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,690
You're still fat, Harry.

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,171
- Get off!
- Bitch.

29
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,651
Yeah.

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,446
OK. Now.

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,685
Follow them.

32
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,403
Take a left here,
head to the centre of town.

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,571
I'm going in.

34
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,131
There's too many people.

35
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,885
They're gonna go upstairs, find there's
no one there and that'll be it.

36
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,727
No.

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,400
Give me your fucking gun.

38
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,201
Wait here.

39
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,761
Excuse me, sir.

40
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,731
Move!

41
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,280
Ah!

42
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,487
He never stated his destination?

43
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,571
He gave his driver instructions
as we went along.

44
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,883
He never suspected
who you worked for?

45
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,281
No.

46
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,600
The Semtex?

47
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,681
It was taken.

48
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,571
I placed a tracer in one of the blocks
the night before.

49
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,082
The tracer went offline
when the attack took place.

50
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,481
We're trying to kick-start it
remotely now.

51
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,482
The perpetrators knew
we were gonna be there at that time.

52
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,081
They knew where we were going.

53
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,525
And you didn't stop them?

54
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,481
Perhaps you don't
belong here any more.

55
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,803
So we've no idea to whom
the Semtex was to be delivered?

56
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,961
No.

57
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,806
You and I, Charlotte, in five.

58
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,089
Difficult times.
He's getting pressures from on high.

59
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,330
You did what you could, Ewan.

60
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,651
Charlotte?

61
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,245
Present from my ex-husband.

62
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,687
Get that seen to and get some rest.

63
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,927
On my break.
I've got two minutes left.

64
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,082
No, I'm not smoking.

65
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,443
I'm not inhaling, I'm walking.

66
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,642
I'm out of breath
cos I had to rush back from lunch.

67
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,481
Tuna sandwich.
Tuna sandwich and some crisps,

68
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,722
and a chocolate biscuit
and a coffee, no sugar.

69
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,929
Hey, we gonna go for drinks? Make it...

70
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,162
about quarter past, yeah?

71
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,011
How's Dad? And the fence?

72
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,885
The garden fence.

73
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,321
Just tell him to wait
and I'll help him the next time I'm up

74
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,200
because his back won't hold up.
I'll get time off. It's not a problem.

75
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,200
I don't know when.
I'll let you know when I know.

76
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,921
Hey, one minute.
It's a good job. Gives me time to drink.

77
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,284
Think, I said think!

78
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,364
About whatever. I've got my degree,
I can do what I want.

79
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,761
Look, I've gotta go, I'm late.
Yep, I love you too.

80
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,887
5Ye- Bye, bye, bye.

81
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,761
Sorry.

82
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,526
See ya.

83
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,927
Can I help you, sir? Table for one?

84
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,370
Almost there.

85
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,091
How did you do it?

86
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,045
Slipped.

87
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,283
Doing something strenuous?

88
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,125
Your girlfriend will love the scar.

89
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,765
Sexy.

90
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,006
Wife.

91
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,927
Come back in two days,
take the stitches out.

92
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,050
Might still be here.

93
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,765
Back in a minute with some painkillers.

94
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,080
Yeah.

95
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,971
It's been confirmed

96
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,123
that a suicide bombing
occurred earlier today

97
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,330
at 12:30 in the busy
South London restaurant, Driscoll's.

98
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,210
With currently confirmed casualties
of 20

99
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,567
and with more understood
to be injured.

100
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,450
The restaurant was full
of lunchtime customers,

101
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,369
including a large meeting being held

102
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,568
by the 2004 Committee,

103
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,371
an organization which had
Middle East energy interests

104
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,011
and championed the Iraq war.

105
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,970
Three backbench MPs were members.

106
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,129
All are believed
to be amongst the fatalities.

107
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,889
The same Semtex that was
stolen was used in the bombing.

108
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,089
An element in Whitehall feels that
Obama's inclusive doctrine

109
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,881
has spread across the Atlantic
and has made us complacent.

110
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,321
They're pushing for sweeping changes.

111
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,047
If they discover that the Semtex
was being monitored by us

112
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,963
and that we could have stopped it...

113
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,127
I don't need to tell you
the repercussions for this government,

114
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,089
especially with the election looming.

115
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,401
The clock is ticking on all of us.

116
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,888
It's just you and I here, Charlotte.

117
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,843
What can you do for me?

118
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,810
We are here to remember
Corporal Peter Walcott Tiernan,

119
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,525
taken from us in the service of Queen
and country in Afghanistan.

120
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,451
He bravely answered his country's call,
and leaves a loving wife, Louise,

121
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,330
his brothers, Ian and Daniel,
and his mother, Margaret.

122
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,283
It's at times like these that
we must find strength and peace

123
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,367
in the memories
of what he meant to us,

124
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,727
an honorable son and brother.

125
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,882
He was older than his 25 years
and was the one his family relied upon

126
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,281
since losing their
father at an early age.

127
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,809
He undertook his responsibilities
with dignity and strength

128
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,451
and maintained a strong family bond.

129
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,886
Remember he said
he had a trial for United?

130
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,568
He said he missed out
cos he was too fast.

131
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,970
You remember, sir?

132
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,645
Yeah, I remember.

133
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,529
Last letter I got from him, he...

134
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,407
He said the regiment
weren't the same since you left.

135
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,650
- How are you, mate?
- How do I look like I am?

136
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,203
Cold makes it hurt like a bastard.

137
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,283
I can't sleep properly.

138
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,724
What happened there?

139
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,523
Ah, some stupid accident.

140
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,444
- Is that your wife?
- Yeah.

141
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,484
Thinks I'm some sort of invalid.

142
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,971
She can't stop fussing.

143
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,851
You should be thankful.

144
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,842
See that bomb they set off in London?

145
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,081
It was on the news.
It never ends. None of it.

146
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,128
What was the point of Pete dying, sir?

147
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,482
Dying in some shithole country
for nothing.

148
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,404
- What was the fucking point?
- What's the matter with you?

149
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,563
Have some respect for him,
for his family.

150
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,449
You got hurt, but you're here.
You're alive.

151
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,569
Listen to me,

152
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,044
we move on.

153
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,689
What's here and now,
that's all that matters, all right?

154
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,129
Go back to your wife.

155
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,850
If you need help,

156
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,765
you can always find me.

157
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,251
We stick together, all of us.

158
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,529
Have you moved on, sir?
From what happened?

159
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,966
Hello?

160
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,281
A car will be downstairs
in 15 minutes.

161
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,001
I'm Mark.

162
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,050
Baby daughter.

163
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,048
Take the path through the wood.
You'll find her at the other end.

164
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,526
Bit of a walk.

165
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,085
You've seen the news.
20 dead, scores injured.

166
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,691
Semtex was used. You understand?

167
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,483
Perpetrator?

168
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,847
It was strapped to his jacket,
self-detonated.

169
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,721
No details on who he was.
CCTV have no clear images.

170
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,731
There's nothing left of him.

171
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,564
We're bound by procedure.

172
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,360
In this situation,
we cannot afford those constraints.

173
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,683
This is off-reservation.
It's why you're at my home.

174
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,007
I want you to find who's responsible

175
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,890
and stop him
in whatever way you feel fit.

176
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,644
Let it be done quickly.

177
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,605
It'll be you and Mark.
He's young but capable.

178
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,284
Very good with a gun, I hear.

179
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,170
I want it low-tech, old trade craft.

180
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,122
If you get caught,
I don't want evidence.

181
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,130
I'll supply technical backup
and the sweep and clean.

182
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,251
No luck yet with the tracer
you planted in the Semtex

183
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,210
but we did find something curious
of your man Harry.

184
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,130
No bullets in his automatic.
Any thoughts?

185
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,371
Maybe.

186
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,882
You're my hands on this, Ewan,
my conscience.

187
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,721
Wipe it clean.

188
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,725
No loose ends.

189
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,410
Where's Harry?

190
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,207
Fat cheapskate owes me money.

191
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,211
Harry's dead.

192
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,208
I want you to think carefully,
more carefully than you've ever thought.

193
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,645
Was there anything...

194
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,321
Anything unusual happened
in the last few days?

195
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,481
Anything you know
but you're not telling me?

196
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,922
Dead? What are you talking about?

197
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,966
I'm leaving.

198
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,687
You took the bullets from his gun.
Why?

199
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,763
I don't know what you're talking about.

200
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,604
I don't have time to waste.

201
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,251
I know you know something
and I'm not leaving until you talk,

202
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,005
- one way or another.

203
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,726
Talk.

204
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,041
I don't know anything. Please.

205
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,761
By the time I'm through with your face,

206
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,923
nobody's going to wanna look at you,
let alone pay to fuck you.

207
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,769
He said nothing would happen.

208
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,966
What?

209
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,168
- He told me it was just business.
- Who did?

210
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,050
- A client.
- Which client? Tell me about him.

211
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,327
- Young guy, said his name was Paul.
- Paul?

212
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,768
I saw him regular for two months.
He wanted to know stuff about Harry.

213
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,127
- What stuff?
- What he was up to, his routine,

214
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,930
he paid me extra.

215
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,005
I told him useless stuff-
who he met, what time, his routine,

216
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,401
- just useless stuff.
- What about the bullets?

217
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,164
Said it was a joke to take them out.

218
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,527
Said Harry showed up with a gun.
He wanted to teach him a lesson.

219
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,364
Where did you meet him?
What did he look like?

220
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,408
At his house. Expensive place.

221
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,802
Short hair, brown, slim,
could pass for Greek or Italian

222
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,847
but he was an Arab.

223
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,570
- How do you know?
- I have Arab friends.

224
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,564
I know what the language sounds like.
Heard him speaking it on the phone.

225
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,449
You know his address?

226
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,162
When the bomb went off,
there was a flash,

227
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,049
and then there was lots of smoke.

228
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,567
A lot of glass flying. There was
a lot of people on the ground.

229
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,007
Horrendous, huge explosion...

230
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,207
I don't know.
I just felt it more than anything else.

231
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,731
Ash.

232
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,605
Jesus.

233
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,491
How have you been?

234
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,211
Good, yeah. You?

235
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,370
Yeah, I'm good.

236
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,643
Do you, uh, live around here?

237
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,041
No, I'm just... Coffee.

238
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,604
It's good to see you.

239
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,530
Yeah, you too.

240
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,487
I have to go. I'm late for something.

241
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,571
Listen, um...
Do you have a number?

242
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,680
If you...
If you give me yours, I can...

243
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,006
- If I can get this thing to work.
- It's all right, give me yours.

244
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,366
I'll tap into this.

245
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,364
Um... OK.

246
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,602
07950...

247
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,723
956958.

248
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,408
- Got it.

249
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,325
Look, I have to go.
I'm really late for something, but...

250
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,406
Really nice to see you again.

251
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,846
Horrific.
What we saw was devastation.

252
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,400
It was just horrific, really.
It was like being in a war zone.

253
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,130
It was crazy and I heard screams.

254
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,124
People like, kind of injured,
and their clothes were all, like...

255
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,531
Everyone was just covered in dust.

256
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,046
We have with us
today Crispin Jones,

257
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,610
who is an intelligence expert.

258
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,889
Crispin, what are your thoughts
about the recent spate of bombings?

259
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,964
Well, I think it's too early
for us to speculate

260
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,963
as to who's involved, but, um,

261
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,963
the hallmarks of the bombing
really do point

262
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,202
to home-grown Islamic terrorism.

263
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,085
Cowardly way the bombs were lit
in a public place,

264
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,365
nature of the types of explosives,
and it seems to be...

265
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,170
Off you 9°

266
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,086
Hi.

267
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,889
Can I use your bathroom?

268
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,845
Yeah, you know where it is.

269
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,449
So why are you here?

270
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,689
You always said if I needed any help
I could speak to you.

271
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,970
I need money.

272
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,928
Can I get a drink?

273
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,011
Yeah, sure.

274
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,606
Get your fucking hands up!

275
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,125
- You got me into this!
- Fucking whore!

276
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,611
- Get your hands up!
- Fucking bitch!

277
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,648
- Get away from him!
- You got me into this!

278
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,571
Check outside.

279
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,686
- Hello?
- Why'd you hang up?

280
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,648
Yeah, I didn't know what to say.

281
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,684
Why didn't you move your lips
and something would have come out.

282
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,167
Listen, are you free to meet?

283
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,561
It's a bright,
sunny morning in London town,

284
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,369
with highs in the early 20$...

285
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,447
Coming up, lots of new music
and a few other surprises in store!

286
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,727
It's nine minutes past eight...

287
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,484
Time for some music.

288
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,729
It's Blur, from their last album,
Think Tank.

289
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,210
I love this song.

290
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,609
Oh, God, it's gonna stay in my head
for the whole day now.

291
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,204
Shooting star?

292
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,211
It's going out in beautiful flames.

293
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,722
You remember I said
that I was late a couple of weeks ago?

294
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,966
Yeah.

295
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,281
Well, I came on the other day.

296
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,724
Aren't you relieved?

297
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,770
I'm disappointed, actually.

298
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,410
I mean, obviously, that kid would have
my good looks and massive brain.

299
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,245
When do I get to
meet your mum?

300
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,611
Well, you'd have to put
some clothes on first.

301
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,762
You haven't told her
about me, have you?

302
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,444
Is it cos I'm not a nice Muslim girl?

303
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,326
She doesn't know

304
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,246
that you're a bacon-eating,
lager-drinking sex maniac?

305
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,607
John Major signed a peace treaty
with Sinn Féin

306
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,081
because the IRA's violent actions
forced him to.

307
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,802
Gerry Adams changed from a terrorist
to a politician but it was violence

308
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,009
and legal action that forced the change.
Not one lawyer was involved.

309
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,811
Gerry Adams is a murderer.

310
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,043
This is a law class.
It's not a political forum for you to...

311
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,361
Actually, in today's context
he is recognised and accepted.

312
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,410
He's being invited to have tea
with the Prime Minister, for fuck's sake.

313
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,722
Ash, just keep it civilized.

314
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,520
I'm sorry.

315
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,727
Cos he matched them with violence.

316
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,845
I mean, look at Israel,
created through a violent struggle

317
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,571
and now it's an internationally
recognised state.

318
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,642
In America, the American forefathers
fought the British,

319
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,643
beat them hands down,
and now what are they?

320
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,290
They're the biggest
superpower on this planet.

321
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,966
Why? Because violence
is the supreme authority

322
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,010
all authorities derive
their power and legitimacy from.

323
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,446
Law is completely irrelevant
in the face of true force.

324
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,364
That applies to any country.

325
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,522
And what's your country?

326
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,041
Ash.

327
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,529
Can I have a word?

328
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,330
You may be smart
but you are close to failing.

329
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,604
It's a I'm afraid.

330
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,086
I can handle this.

331
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,288
Ash, do you really want
to practice law?

332
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,204
- Ash?
- Don't worry.

333
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,325
"All right, I'm coming out.

334
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,482
"You, coming out now.

335
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,208
"Any man I see outside
I'm going to shoot.

336
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,248
"Any son of a bitch
who starts to shoot at me,

337
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,288
"I'm going to shoot them, too.

338
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,761
"Then I'm going to kill
all his friends, his family,

339
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,486
"and then second generation,
everybody.

340
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,689
"Then I'm going
to burn their house down."

341
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,001
It's Unforgiven, you know?

342
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,368
Clint Eastwood after he's killed
everyone for murdering his friend,

343
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,923
played by the noble Morgan Freeman.
Oh, man, great actor.

344
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,404
I'm Nabil. You are?

345
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,922
- I'm Ash.
- Ah, Ash.

346
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,844
Like cigarette ash.

347
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,320
It's not your real name, huh?

348
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,410
Don't be ashamed of who you are, huh?

349
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,209
Short for Ashraf, yes?

350
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,886
You look how
they've killed Muslims, huh,

351
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,809
- in Bosnia, Chechnya, Kosovo.

352
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,321
And now they've invaded Iraq
for the bloody oil.

353
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,323
Come to one of my meetings.

354
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,085
Here, take... Take, uh...
Take some of these, yeah?

355
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,050
Take five, you give them
to your friends.

356
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,289
You have friends, don't you?

357
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,489
Your face!

358
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,720
Hey!

359
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,207
Oh, Allah wouldn't be pleased!

360
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,650
Sorry, what did you say?

361
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,001
- What were you guys doing in there?
- Just a little pick-me-up.

362
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,366
Were you doing that shit with him?

363
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,363
Ash, don't start. I'm not in the mood.

364
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,686
Come on, come on.

365
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,601
Oh!

366
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,441
You all right?

367
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,726
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey.

368
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,564
- Get the fuck off me!
- Easy!

369
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,130
Get off me! God.

370
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,331
Come here.

371
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,481
Ash, I'm sorry.

372
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,005
What the fuck's
the matter with you, huh?

373
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,320
Trying to make me
look like a fucking idiot?

374
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,890
- No.
- Doing that shit with him, huh?

375
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,961
That fucking prick.

376
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,565
What were you doing
in the fucking toilets, huh?

377
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,801
- Nothing.
- Sucking his cock?

378
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,166
- I'm sorry.
- Was he feeling...

379
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,765
- Fuck off!
- Come on, Ash.

380
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,524
Just as long as you have
a fucking great time,

381
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,840
you know, fucking get wasted.

382
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,251
You don't give a shit about anything,
do you?

383
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,685
- You don't care about anything.
- Look, I'm sorry.

384
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,250
Listen, look, I'm sorry, OK?

385
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,651
I'm sorry.

386
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,007
I promise I won't do it again.

387
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,969
This is the last time, OK?

388
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,281
You know I love you.

389
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,524
We must rise up against
these Western pigs

390
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,047
who occupy our lands.

391
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,210
Who come at us with smiles
to take what's ours

392
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,850
and turn us against each other.

393
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,048
In this so-called democracy,

394
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,962
if you speak up about
Muslims being slaughtered,

395
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,327
you're an extremist. Huh? Yes?

396
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,129
Yes, yes.

397
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:12,250
But if you are passive, huh?
Silent, easy to control, huh?

398
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,088
You're a good Muslim. Yes?

399
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,482
Just like a dog, they throw you a bone.

400
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,408
But keep you on a leash, ah?

401
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,324
You know the type of Muslim
I'm talking about.

402
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,801
He's so ashamed of who he is.

403
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,641
He gives himself a Western name.

404
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,643
He tries to think and feel
like his Western master.

405
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,529
Live like him, be him!

406
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,170
You say to him...

407
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,811
My friend, you say to him,

408
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,366
"Let's stop the murder of Muslims."

409
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,286
And he would say,
"You ignorant foreigner,

410
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,810
"you want me to jeopardize
my nice life and my country, huh?"

411
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,244
This is the fool who wears
an England football shirt,

412
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,809
and says,
"Ah, we won the match." Huh?

413
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,563
And the man next to him,
in the same shirt,

414
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,442
he calls him a Paki, hmm?

415
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,931
A nigger.

416
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,005
Ask yourself, "Who are you?"

417
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,401
Really?

418
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,045
All right, matey?

419
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,128
I'll just get a couple of pints, please.

420
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,366
How's Kate?

421
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,449
She was off her head last night.
I've never seen anyone drink

422
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,570
or snort as much as that in my life.
An animal.

423
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,969
So how come you weren't there?

424
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,525
She not tell you she was out?

425
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,487
I wanted her to suck me off
but she passed out.

426
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,643
It's OK, hey, no problem.

427
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,641
It's all right, my friend,
it's no problem, no problem.

428
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,728
Come, come, move, come.

429
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,724
It's all right, it's all right, a racist.
Bastard. Come on.

430
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,962
You know, it felt good, what I did.

431
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,369
You know, sometimes to earn respect,

432
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,122
we have to do things
we wouldn't normally do.

433
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,204
You know, people like us
have to do that

434
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,962
just to get the basic respect
most people take for granted.

435
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,925
In Afghanistan, hmm,

436
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,281
we had to fight to earn respect
and freedom from the Russians.

437
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,970
You were there?

438
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,929
What was it like?

439
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,004
What happens on the battlefield
is between you and God.

440
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,450
I am here now.

441
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,605
God didn't will it for me
to enter paradise.

442
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,685
But I'm content, you know?
Contentment is a state of mind.

443
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,124
Like Palestine.

444
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,047
You know, law is not for me.

445
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,681
I don't want to be
part of any hypocrisy.

446
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,450
Look.

447
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,929
Would you call them
dignified human beings, hmm?

448
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,850
They're just having fun.

449
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,563
My friend, no,
we are not like them.

450
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,367
What time is it?

451
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,010
You have a rough night?

452
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,845
My head.

453
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,681
Listen, Kate.

454
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,643
I don't think we should
see each other any more.

455
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,960
Why?

456
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,849
Same shit every day.

457
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,802
You don't know when to stop.

458
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,882
I'm 23, for God's sake.

459
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,204
Look, I'll stop when I'm older.
I'm enjoying myself.

460
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,404
Will you just relax, for Christ's sake?

461
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,768
Right, I don't want to see you
any more. OK?

462
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,688
I don't want this any more.

463
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,684
You can go back to sleep if you like.

464
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,886
Oh, what, just like that?

465
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,246
Black and white?
It's so fucking easy for you, isn't it?

466
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,807
You want to end it with me and...

467
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,642
you end it, just like it's nothing.

468
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,409
You want to leave? Just go.

469
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,010
Get over yourself.

470
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,366
Ash!

471
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,482
The terror level
stays at "critical"

472
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,643
and some are calling London
a city under siege.

473
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,960
The government announced today

474
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,407
that it would proceed as planned
with the general election.

475
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,211
We ask whether it would be best
to postpone the election

476
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,645
in the interests of public safety.

477
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,245
The government, however, may feel

478
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,166
that an alteration to the election date
would be seen as a victory for...

479
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,925
Nice place.

480
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,686
Swish.

481
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,923
Present for my baby daughter.

482
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,168
You have to check for small parts.

483
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,005
Ever wondered why they do it?

484
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,771
Too simplistic to think
they just hate us?

485
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,881
What does that have to do
with this girl?

486
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,571
Look at her.

487
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,491
Have you served for your country?

488
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,610
No.

489
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,371
I fought over there.

490
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,889
To stop this from happening here.
Again.

491
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,569
Didn't stop. They're not going to stop.

492
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,324
And neither will I.

493
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,923
I'm going to find every one of them...

494
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,446
and send them to the death
they pray for.

495
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,366
Hello?

496
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,125
There's a file for you
at the drop box in 10 minutes.

497
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,046
Come on.

498
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,731
You hesitated before
you gave the safe signal.

499
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,611
Is someone following you?

500
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,960
Maybe.

501
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,921
I couldn't say.

502
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,970
Did you walk here?
Circuits?

503
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,884
I've been down Holborn,
Chancery Lane, Oxford Street.

504
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,888
- Two hours.
- Shall I report it?

505
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,166
I'm not sure.

506
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,562
Bombings are making us all nervous.

507
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,405
Don't worry about it.

508
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,124
They found the receipt in Paul's house
for two pay-as-you-go phones.

509
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,771
Paul had one. The other was used
two hours ago from that building.

510
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,888
The phone was used
to call Afghanistan.

511
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,491
He's in there on his own.

512
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,530
It's not registered to anyone.
It's an abandoned council property.

513
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,090
We can go in round the back.

514
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,811
We go in and take him.
Shots to the head.

515
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,326
Anything else allows him to detonate,
understood?

516
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,561
Yeah.

517
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,606
Come on.

518
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,122
- Get up!
- Ah! No!

519
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,884
Don't! Stop! No!

520
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,247
Where's your jacket, hey?

521
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,731
- I said don't shoot!
- Face the wall!

522
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,404
I said face the fucking wall!

523
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,926
- Face the fucking wall!
- I said don't shoot!

524
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,806
Close the door. Go!

525
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,685
Let me just talk to you, man.

526
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,444
I said let me talk to you!

527
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,931
How many people were you gonna kill?

528
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,525
Just give me a second, please.

529
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,364
Get on your fucking knees!

530
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,727
I don't know what
you're talking about, all right?

531
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,802
- How many?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

532
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,646
Just listen to me and calm down,
and me and you can...

533
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,568
An eye for an eye, yeah?

534
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,564
I'm just like you.

535
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,041
I'm just...

536
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,005
I'm just like you, all right?

537
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,606
You're nothing like me,
you fucking animal.

538
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,046
Please, don't!

539
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,326
I can do what I want to you.

540
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,811
I can do anything I want.

541
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,881
You know that?

542
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,845
Please don't!

543
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,720
Move!

544
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,920
Let him burn.

545
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,249
Oh, fucking hell.

546
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,808
The tracer on the Semtex
was kick-started.

547
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,086
This will take you right to it.

548
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,367
Who was the man I just killed?

549
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,004
You have to go now.

550
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,161
Mujeeb Ajmed. Pakistani parents,
23 years old, UK citizen.

551
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,607
At the precise moment
he was signing on, squatting in the flat.

552
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,443
Not a bomber.

553
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,362
What other options
were you faced with?

554
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,850
Considering the past days' events,
your past...

555
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,325
what you've been through,
what we've all been through.

556
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,849
You were not there.

557
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,807
We have removed all traces of you.
It was a squat in a dealer's hangout.

558
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,291
What's done is done.

559
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,651
How did he get the phone?

560
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,001
Stolen, obviously, from Paul.

561
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,845
Do you have anything
that would link you with this incident?

562
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,486
Just his jacket.

563
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,170
Get rid of it.

564
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,843
This is no time to doubt.

565
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,808
Innocent lives are at stake.

566
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,281
Finish it.

567
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,330
Do you remember Ian?

568
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,971
The stoner who used to steal
our milk and top it up with water.

569
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,883
Oh yeah, he used to piss
into a water bottle

570
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,564
cos he couldn't be bothered
to walk to the toilet.

571
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,325
Yeah, I saw three
full bottles in there once.

572
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,167
So what have you been up to
all this time?

573
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,208
Oh, nothing much, just been drifting.

574
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,611
You didn't get into law?

575
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,125
No, it wasn't for me.

576
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,248
I always thought you were
gonna be a high flyer.

577
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,651
Have your own firm.

578
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,883
Not like me. I always knew I'd end up
working in the dullest law practice ever.

579
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,571
Why don't you just quit?

580
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,042
- It's not that easy. I can't just...
- No.

581
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,122
- ...leave my job.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

582
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,170
So are you, um...
Are you married or anything?

583
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,807
No, not married.

584
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,249
Relationships, yeah.

585
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,965
There was this one guy
but that just ended.

586
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,366
No, I loved him.

587
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,644
He just wasn't interested.
Wasted four years of my life.

588
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,688
Lost it a bit, actually.

589
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,331
Still managed to keep my job
at the law firm.

590
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,322
And then I went crazy wanting kids.

591
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,964
Never met anyone.

592
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,401
You?

593
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,770
Nothing serious.

594
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,884
How's your mum?

595
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,330
Is she still trying to get you
to marry a nice Muslim girl?

596
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,131
No. She, um... She died
a couple of years ago.

597
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,364
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

598
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,844
You look beautiful.

599
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,888
I hardly ever think about those days.

600
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,727
Uni feels like another life to me.

601
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,211
What you doing?

602
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,484
We, uh, we organise activities
for young Muslims.

603
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,764
Camping in the Brecon Beacons,
rafting, paintball, team bonding.

604
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,604
And we combine these
with religious teachings.

605
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,968
Now, as a successful Muslim
businessman, you want your staff...

606
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,441
- Your Muslim staff.
- ...to be of good character, right?

607
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,203
Thank you for coming to visit me
and for making this offer,

608
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,611
but I'll have to pass.

609
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,329
I don't involve myself
in my workers' private lives.

610
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,008
I'm not a religious man,
but faith is a...a personal thing.

611
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,088
What they do in their own time
is their business,

612
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,322
and that's what's great
about this country.

613
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,285
But thank you.

614
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,050
Great about this country?

615
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,930
Man, this is the same country
that has destroyed so many cultures.

616
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,843
All our cultures.

617
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,450
- Thanks for your time.
- No problem, thank you.

618
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,483
Oh, Muhammed.

619
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,131
Hey, you look well.

620
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,884
Salam aleikum.

621
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,804
Yeah, how are you?
Good to see you, my friend.

622
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,089
Oi!  Hamed!

623
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,049
Don't shoot me! I'm only...
Hey, good to see you.

624
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,127
How are you?
Good to see you, good to see you.

625
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,361
- Salam aleikum.
- Yussif, yes?

626
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,204
- Yes, yes.
- Which one is this?

627
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,368
This is the one we send to the boys,
but it's the truth.

628
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,124
You're doing excellent work, very good.

629
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,361
- Thanks.
- Now come, we need to talk, huh?

630
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,566
- Yep.
- Shall I come with you, bruv?

631
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,369
No, just, uh, finish up.

632
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,411
He wasn't interested.

633
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,010
No problem. Ah, there...

634
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,811
There are other business people
we can approach, you know?

635
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,886
It's a matter of, uh, getting their
young workers to join us, huh? Huh?

636
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,801
You know,
this gym was a very good idea.

637
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,089
You're doing very, very well, my friend.
Very, very well.

638
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,168
You want to do more, yes?

639
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,165
What have you got in mind?

640
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,766
A test of your will.

641
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,930
And then we shall see about you.

642
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,928
This is Sergeant Glenn Conlon.

643
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,083
Ex-military with
intelligence associations.

644
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,925
He has served in secret prisons
all over the Middle East,

645
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,891
killing and torturing people we know,
you know, people close to us.

646
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,127
He's not in the services any more,
you know, he's...

647
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,485
bought a farm.

648
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,325
Stables, you know,
he wants the quiet life.

649
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,684
He's retired from killing
and humiliating Muslims.

650
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,360
We don't retire.

651
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,321
We don't forget.

652
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,523
There is a man coming from the
Middle East. An important man.

653
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,126
He lands next week.
You'll go and meet him.

654
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,245
You'll do as he asks.
But he needs your assistance.

655
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,290
This is a foreign country to him.

656
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,005
You'll need another man.

657
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,967
You have someone?

658
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,963
Yeah, Yussif.
Good.

659
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,602
You're going to help
our friend with Sergeant Conlon.

660
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,125
Ash raf?

661
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,365
Peaceful streets.

662
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,925
lngleezee.

663
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,326
What?

664
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,610
Englishman.

665
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,687
He gets up at 8:00AM,
goes to the barn,

666
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,366
cleans it for an hour
and then goes to the stables.

667
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,601
Who lives with him?

668
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,404
- Nobody.
- No wife?

669
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,921
No.

670
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,006
When he comes out of his house,
follow him into the barn.

671
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,726
Show him the gun.

672
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,362
We come out, we beat him,
tie him, take him.

673
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,646
You do everything like I tell you to,
you understand?

674
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,889
A knife for you.

675
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,486
No fork.

676
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,325
Go and see what is happening.

677
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,245
I'm going to cut
your head off like a pig's.

678
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,802
- Anyone else here?
- No one.

679
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,328
Put him in the van.
Put your dead friend there, too.

680
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,291
Turn the camera on.

681
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,963
Some breaking news for you now.

682
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,044
A Mr Glenn Conlon
has been reported missing.

683
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,602
Mr Conlon was a banker and
a former private in the Army Reserves.

684
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,289
His sister, Rebecca Conlon,

685
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,728
and her 8-month-old daughter
were found brutally murdered

686
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,763
at his farm in Hertfordshire.

687
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,842
The police have little to go on...

688
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,644
There is anger in you.

689
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,965
Makes no sense.

690
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,004
Why are you helping us?

691
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,366
You're angry with me about
the woman, the baby.

692
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:48,688
Do you think he cared for the families
of the men he tortured and killed?

693
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:56,330
You're confused in the head. Majnoon.

694
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,200
Take it.

695
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,241
These pigs kill our people

696
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:22,928
all over the world
and you feel for them?

697
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,491
What's the matter with you?

698
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,651
Be a man!

699
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,882
The woman saw my face.

700
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,246
The baby.

701
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,529
You're not one of us.

702
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,765
You haven't suffered like we have.

703
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,684
This is your country.

704
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,121
Well, I am sorry about your friend,
you know.

705
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,410
But he was taken doing God's will.

706
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,689
- A true martyr.
- And that soldier?

707
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,451
I mean, he was just a reserve.

708
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,925
My friend.

709
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,766
Do you think they would publicise
the fact that he was a torturer?

710
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,808
And what about the woman
and the baby, huh?

711
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,689
Collateral damage.

712
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,287
Who invented that phrase? That...
Enough of this!

713
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,408
You know you can't stay
in this country, huh?

714
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,764
Too dangerous. One door closes.

715
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,851
Another opens.

716
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,290
Before our colleague left,
he said you were a capable man.

717
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,045
But that you... You know, you need

718
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:18,365
experience to see what
these pigs do to your people.

719
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,441
Hmm?

720
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,684
I think he was right.

721
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,971
Afghanistan.

722
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,282
You'll go there, with a new identity,
to our friends.

723
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,807
Be taught useful things,
then you'll come back.

724
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,211
And if you don't return...

725
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:45,051
then your prize will be more than
anything any one of us could wish for.

726
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,960
Paradise.

727
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,123
It's what you wanted, yes?

728
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,401
An unidentified,
deceased male was found

729
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,768
horrifically burnt in an abandoned
warehouse in East London.

730
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:09,046
The body was so disfigured
no details of him are available.

731
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,602
The location was
a known drugs factory

732
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,251
and haunt of local gangs and dealers.

733
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,651
- Police are treating...

734
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,567
There's nothing we could have done.
We were doing our job.

735
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,569
Our job is to do what's right.

736
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,291
What did she mean?

737
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,970
She said something about you.
What was she talking about?

738
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,365
My wife was killed in the bombings
a few years back.

739
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,571
I'm sorry.

740
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,808
She'd have been 34 this year.

741
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:04,008
She had nothing to do with all...
With all this, you know?

742
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,848
Some days...

743
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,604
Yeah, some days, I...

744
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,846
That thing still in there?

745
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,046
What?

746
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,650
How do you turn it off?

747
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,609
You turn it that way. No.

748
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,361
That way.

749
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,885
The other way.

750
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,289
- The other way. Yeah.

751
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,560
You OK?

752
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,005
Fine.

753
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,084
I remember this.

754
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:22,960
It's embarrassing.

755
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,489
Look, I'm sorry about what happened.

756
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,401
About the way I acted back then.
If I could change it, I would.

757
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,610
Is everything all right with you, Kate?

758
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,168
- With your life?
- It's fine.

759
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,003
It's not as easy as it used to be,
but don't have to talk about that now.

760
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,961
We just... We slipped away.

761
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,887
I have never stopped
thinking about you, Kate.

762
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,723
You have to know that.

763
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,090
Look, if you have things to do,
we could just meet this afternoon.

764
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,284
I know this pub.

765
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,011
I'd like to.

766
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,725
Where have you been?

767
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,241
Paul was meant to go ahead last night.

768
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,485
He's vanished.

769
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,127
- Were you followed?
- No.

770
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,645
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

771
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,242
We have to change our plans.

772
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,880
You have to make contact
with the third man and help him.

773
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:08,889
- You stay with him. I'll be in touch.
- When is he due to go ahead?

774
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,726
Tomorrow.

775
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,766
What's the matter with you?

776
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,321
It isn't time to be weak and emotional.
We have no time for emotions now.

777
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,527
Especially when your brothers
and sisters are suffering.

778
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,610
You know who I am, yeah?

779
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,322
- Yeah.
- Is there anything else?

780
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,562
- Any papers? Receipts?
- No.

781
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,444
OK, use this.

782
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,531
I'm going to go first.

783
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,610
You wait here for a few minutes
and then follow me, OK?

784
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,201
You stay calm.

785
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,568
Have a look round, Mark.
Check round the corner.

786
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,165
Have a look up there.

787
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,090
It's him!

788
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,931
Fuck!

789
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,327
- We got him.
I heard.

790
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,925
There was someone there watching.

791
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,650
- Who?
- I don't know.

792
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,688
Somebody across the road.
He got away on a bike.

793
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,524
He's connected.

794
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,764
Get the CCTV footage.
Should be a clear shot of him.

795
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,723
There are two rooms
at the Glassmore Hotel

796
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,404
booked in the name
of Michael and John Smith.

797
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,086
Check in.
I'll be there when I have something.

798
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,448
One more thing. There is a team
on us, our people. Watch yourselves.

799
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,525
Our people? Why?

800
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,607
What we are doing is not
standard. Make sure that...

801
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,605
Where the fuck's she gone?

802
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,011
Hey-

803
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,205
You look tired.

804
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,691
I'm fine.

805
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,121
It was a nightmare getting
here with all the madness.

806
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,241
What?

807
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,448
There was a bomb scare
on the train coming here.

808
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:52,727
Scared shitless.

809
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,922
Bunch of murdering maniacs.
Hope they kill the lot of them.

810
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,809
You know when I said I didn't think
about those days at uni any more?

811
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,329
- Yeah.
- I was lying.

812
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,921
I know.

813
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,248
You know, I thought I saw you
once a few years ago.

814
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,202
I just lost you in the crowd.

815
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,401
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

816
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:28,164
Especially since it's your round.

817
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,167
Can I get a red wine
and orange juice, please?

818
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,571
No problem at all.

819
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,406
There you go. That's £5 exactly.

820
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,651
Thank you.

821
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,207
Good, good. You take it to the car.

822
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,371
Here, you, take...
Take the cake. I will be five minutes.

823
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,644
My son, it's his birthday.

824
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,688
They were there. They knew.

825
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,683
You shouldn't be here.

826
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,649
Your target is an American neo-con.

827
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,970
Head of a think-tank, instrumental
in planning the war on terror.

828
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,569
His daughter is getting married
to an Englishman.

829
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,801
Where?

830
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,931
I'll know tomorrow.
You still have your phone, huh?

831
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,050
God be with you, my friend.

832
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,766
Will I see my family?

833
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,286
What?

834
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,281
Oh, you'll see everyone
who's important in your life.

835
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,129
Everyone who has passed away,
and... And... And it will seem like

836
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,366
only half a day has passed
since you last saw them.

837
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,521
Huh?

838
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,966
You OK?

839
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,846
I'm good.

840
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,885
You did well.

841
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,681
Stay alert.

842
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,246
- Yeah.

843
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,489
Yeah, I know the place.

844
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,722
For those of you looking for reasons,

845
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,280
then I suggest you pay
attention to what I have to say.

846
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:31,522
For far too long, you've ignored
what is happening around you.

847
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,729
You've not seen the inevitable
that is coming at you.

848
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,723
The inevitability of my actions.

849
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,563
Who are you, hey?

850
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,005
Who are you working for?

851
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,851
- Talk to me. Who sent you?

852
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,843
You've never opened
your mouths in protest

853
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,445
at my people's suffering.

854
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,686
Answer me!

855
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,843
- Your silence has been deafening.
- Who sent you? Talk!

856
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,605
Words have had no impact on you.

857
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,728
Politics has had no impact on you.

858
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,443
Look at Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine.
The list goes on and on.

859
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,090
And you continue to ignore it.

860
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,443
You seem confused at our actions.

861
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,169
Lost in your decadent world.

862
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,606
Unable to act.

863
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,331
Unable to move.

864
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,164
Frozen in time.

865
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,642
So now I'm going to communicate to
you in a language you can understand.

866
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,886
My words are dead

867
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,526
until I give them life with
your blood and mine.

868
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,925
I'm sure by now your
newspapers and television

869
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,968
have depicted me as a madman,

870
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,646
an evil outsider
hell-bent on destruction.

871
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,407
Your corrupt and degenerate media

872
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,051
will spin my actions to suit
the government agenda.

873
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,404
They want you misinformed,
scared and docile,

874
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,086
so that you continue to ignore
their murderous actions.

875
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,645
They are happy for you
to lose yourself and all that this world

876
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,768
has to offer so that you stay unaware

877
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,764
and intoxicated
with their mindless chatter.

878
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,407
So that you do not question
the situation you find yourselves in.

879
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,041
Trapped in a vicious circle
of your own doing.

880
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,642
My life has been a journey
towards violence,

881
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:53,881
but it's not one I regret.

882
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,850
There is no guilt for me.
There is no thoughts of the past

883
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,002
or what I did or didn't do.
My search is over.

884
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,891
My hands have been guided by

885
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,361
a force that's greater
than anything on this world.

886
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,885
I've found my peace.

887
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,450
You must understand that things
do not happen without reason.

888
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,082
There are no coincidences.

889
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,010
Come in, come in.

890
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,889
So listen carefully
to what I have to say.

891
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:21,646
Where are you?
Give us your location, where are you?

892
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,681
Everything is in position.
He has entered and heading towards

893
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,684
the kitchen area.
CCTV has been immobilized.

894
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,766
The material world that you
worship is meaningless and empty.

895
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,724
It means nothing to me.

896
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,370
I leave it behind gladly.

897
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,491
- I have sacrificed myself...

898
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:48,803
...for something higher than what
this world has to offer.

899
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,609
I strive for a higher ground.

900
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,768
Now, your government,

901
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,489
the government that you voted for,

902
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,484
commit atrocities against
my people all over this world.

903
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,570
Your support for them
makes you responsible.

904
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,366
I'm not a hypocrite.

905
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,284
I will not sit by while my brothers
and sisters are being slaughtered.

906
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,405
The path that has led me here
has been littered with obstacles.

907
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,563
But I have remained strong.

908
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,404
I am sure of my actions.

909
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,845
Then I will not falter.

910
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:02,526
Until you stop the bombing,
imprisonment and torture of my people,

911
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,611
we will not stop.

912
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,969
We have entered the realm of war,
and I am a soldier.

913
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,521
Until we feel security,
you will be our targets.

914
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,682
You are all responsible
for turning a blind eye

915
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,524
to the butchery of my people.

916
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,564
I'm only a man, but my actions
are the price you pay

917
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,927
for your apathy, for your debauchery.

918
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,849
I've lived amongst you,
but I'm not a part of you.

919
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,409
You've not seen me until now.

920
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,603
I am God's lonely man.

921
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,330
Your 9/11s, your 7/7s,
are what my people

922
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,767
suffer on a daily basis
around the world.

923
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,683
You know nothing of suffering.

924
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,209
So now I'm going to show you.

925
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:15,161
My prayers have all been answered

926
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:18,084
and no earthly force can
take them away from me.

927
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,769
I will rise up against you.

928
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,849
- You'll not forget me.

929
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,049
You have killed thousands
of my brothers and sisters.

930
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,802
That much death has a consequence
you will pay for with your blood.

931
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,001
There will be more like me,
l promise you.

932
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,410
And we will bring hell
to you and your kind.

933
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,162
And my conscience is clear.

934
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,566
I have no regrets.

935
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:42,845
I live forever. I go to a better place.

936
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,329
What the hell is going on?

937
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,084
You'll need my car.

938
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,641
We need my car.

939
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,803
- Don't! Stop!
- Where's your jacket?

940
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,248
My name is Hussein Malik.

941
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,401
For three years I've worked

942
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,721
as an undercover agent
for our Secret Services

943
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:03,529
and infiltrated Nabil Alawi
and his circle.

944
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,766
Three months ago,
I discovered a plot by Nabil

945
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:10,083
to steal Semtex for the purposes
of an attack on London.

946
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,491
I informed my controllers
to arrest Nabil.

947
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,446
The following day,
the first bomb exploded.

948
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:21,846
I met with my controllers.
They tried to take my life.

949
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,888
My life is in great danger.

950
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,689
I need a guarantee of protection.

951
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,567
A Secret Service team
are after me now.

952
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:33,604
l have enclosed the evidence I have
accumulated and proof of my identity.

953
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:53,203
Since sweeping to
power last month in a landslide victory,

954
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:56,443
the new government has been
quick to make domestic security

955
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,124
the top of their agenda.

956
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,126
Having been given a mandate by
the public with such

957
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,850
a resounding election victory,

958
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:07,164
it's our duty to follow that lead,
and to prioritize making

959
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:11,290
our country absolutely safe
from these cowardly terrorists.

960
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,604
One of the government's first steps

961
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:17,651
was the removal of the Secret
Service's old guard, Sir Scott Catesby,

962
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,481
and the passing of
more stringent terror laws

963
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,962
which saw the deportation
of the radical cleric Nabil Alawi.

964
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:28,565
I am returning to my country
of birth tomorrow

965
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:31,530
but I am distraught that the country

966
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,491
that is my home is expelling me
on false charges.

967
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:40,170
I will fight for my corner.
God save the Queen.

968
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,770
Last week also saw

969
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:45,047
the first official announcement
into the bombings.

970
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:48,291
The perpetrators
were a home-grown cell.

971
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:53,444
None had been identified as
potential threats prior to the attacks.

972
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,530
Meaning they were all cleanskins,

973
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,446
completely unknown to any
of the intelligence services.

974
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,609
The ringleader,Ashraf Ahmed,

975
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:07,082
was personally responsible for
the bombing of the Glassmore Hotel.

976
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,444
The bomb was a timed device
placed in a luggage item,

977
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,410
causing a massive explosion
in the foyer of the hotel.

978
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,525
Ahmed himself was
killed by security services

979
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:21,208
as he tried to trigger a suicide device
just prior to the foyer device exploding.

980
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,604
Helen James, head of the
Glassmore Hotel Victims Committee,

981
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,047
had this to say about the findings.

982
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,964
I don't see how you solve
the underlying problem

983
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:34,170
and I don't think anyone really does.
And, of course, this may lead to...

984
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:38,285
to, you know, more security
and more troops going out

985
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:40,362
and possibly more people being killed,

986
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,090
but I don't see how
that solves the problem.

987
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:00,161
Ewan! I thought they'd gotten to you.

988
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,367
There you go.

989
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,768
It was with his files.

990
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:57,562
You must have left it
when you last met.

991
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,363
You knew all about the bombings.

992
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:05,324
Pretended you were
trying to stop them.

993
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,881
You worked with this Nabil,

994
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,009
then got him safely deported
without arrest.

995
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,082
And I wasn't meant to make it out alive.

996
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,446
You were in line with
a promotion of the new government,

997
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:20,531
helped them win, got rid of your boss.
Must be happy with you.

998
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,809
Played me perfectly.

999
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,849
Knew all about my wife.

1000
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,521
Knew I'd kill anyone you put
in front of me.

1001
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,761
You can use her
as an excuse if you want.

1002
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:44,009
But what you do is in your nature.

1003
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:55,282
I love my country.
I'd kill for it and I'd die for it.

1004
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,405
Good for you.

1005
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,047
The press have been sent
copies of these files.

1006
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:05,884
They show you were responsible.

1007
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:07,849
Those files are nonsense you made up.

1008
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,763
No one will believe it.

1009
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,205
They might...

1010
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:16,449
if you buckle under
the pressure of the story.

1011
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,249
You're out of your mind.

1012
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:27,965
It's in my nature.
