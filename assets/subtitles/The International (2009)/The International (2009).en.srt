1
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:16,072
Listen, I'm from the Bronx,
so you need to keep it simple.

2
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:20,440
Why is the bank buying all this
missile-guidance stuff from Calvini?

3
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,543
I don't get it.

4
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,841
The window will stay closed.

5
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,683
You need to relax.

6
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,052
I'm more comfortable tense.

7
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,283
You came to us, remember?

8
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,655
You wanted a way out
and I'm offering you one.

9
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,627
I only met you 30 minutes ago...

10
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:17,326
...and now you expect me just
to walk away from everything I know...

11
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,662
...put my life in your hands.

12
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,833
You want a little more time
to think things through, I get it...

13
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,109
...but we're gonna need
another meet...

14
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,208
...and I'm gonna need to
see some paper.

15
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,815
Yes. Now get out of the car.

16
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,636
<i>- Hey.
- Ella?</i>

17
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,643
<i>- You done?
- Yeah, I just met with him.</i>

18
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,146
<i>- And?
- Oh, he's real.</i>

19
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,545
He's real enough
to blow this thing wide open.

20
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,085
He told me the bank's
buying $200 million worth...

21
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,154
...of missile-guidance systems.

22
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,689
<i>- What do they need those for?
- I don't know.</i>

23
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,326
<i>You gonna see him a second time?</i>

24
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,726
Yeah, yeah. Listen, we're gonna meet
again. He's agreed to bring me paper.

25
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,730
Right, I'll call you later.

26
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,965
Thanks, Elle.

27
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,757
Hey.

28
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,514
Are you experiencing
any blurred or double vision?

29
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,989
No.

30
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,085
Nothing.

31
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,896
Just follow the light, please.

32
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,271
It's been noted that you were
experiencing ringing in your ears.

33
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,697
Yes.

34
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,742
Well, I would like to keep you here
overnight for observation.

35
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,176
That won't be necessary.

36
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,717
Where's my colleague?

37
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,017
Thomas Schumer.

38
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,496
It was definitely a heart attack?

39
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,476
"Acute myocardial infarction. " Yes.

40
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,018
Your penlight, can I use it?

41
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,230
What are you doing?

42
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,500
Can you help me turn him over?

43
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,545
- I'm afraid I can't allow you to-
- Just help me.

44
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,670
We need to contact the Berlin police
and request an immediate autopsy.

45
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,236
Why?

46
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,698
Because I don't think this man
died of natural causes.

47
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,604
Come on, Ella.

48
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,871
If Schumer met this insider
in Berlin...

49
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,743
...odds are this guy's
a foreign national. So it's federal.

50
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,317
But you're not listening to me.
Let them meet again.

51
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,988
The guy's gonna bring paper
and Tommy will close him.

52
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:34,125
You still have to coordinate with
Justice if you want witness protection.

53
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,057
I just tried both their cells again.
Straight to voicemail.

54
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,423
Shit.

55
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,964
I'm gonna try Tommy's wife at work.
If I have to bring DOJ into this...

56
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,035
...they're gonna do what they've
always done with this.

57
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,105
They're gonna stall us with red tape,
informant's gonna bolt...

58
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,707
...and I'm telling you,
he could be the bombshell...

59
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,435
...we've spent the last two years
looking for.

60
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,943
Voicemail.

61
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,549
What's going on?
Why aren't they calling us back?

62
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,653
What do you want me to do?
I can't afford another turf war.

63
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,791
- It's Salinger.
- Finally. Put him on speaker.

64
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,397
Jesus, Lou.
What took you guys so long?

65
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,433
Hello? You there?

66
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,103
<i>Yeah.</i>

67
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,238
So, what's up?

68
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,598
<i>Tommy's dead.</i>

69
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,472
What?

70
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,011
<i>He's dead, Ella.</i>

71
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,914
<i>I need you to get over here
as soon as you can.</i>

72
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,518
Unnaturally red blood,
lambent membranes.

73
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,956
Two key indicators
of hydrocyanic poisoning.

74
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,663
This lesion on the neck...

75
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,391
...is how the poison was introduced
into the bloodstream, percutaneously.

76
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,626
The lesion tested negative
for any poison.

77
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:54,295
There are any number of reasons
for this discoloration of the blood...

78
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,475
...least likely of which
is hydrocyanic-

79
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,667
I'm telling you, he was murdered.

80
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,487
Well, I'm assuming
you suspect a combination...

81
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,713
...of prussic acid and DMSO...

82
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,116
...but then the reaction time
would have been immediate.

83
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,124
Within one minute.

84
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,093
Which means the killer
would have had to deliver the toxin...

85
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,528
...after Schumer exited the car.

86
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,570
So did you see anything unusual?

87
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,301
Anybody approaching Schumer?

88
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,579
No. I mean...

89
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,683
I don't know.

90
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,421
What is it that makes you so certain
he was assassinated?

91
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,629
Agent Salinger and I have reason
to believe this might be connected...

92
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,066
...to an ongoing investigation
being conducted...

93
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,435
...by both my team at the Manhattan
DA's office and Interpol.

94
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,241
- What investigation?
- I run a group at Interpol...

95
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,902
...that focuses on financial operations
associated with organized crime.

96
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,474
About two years ago, we began
receiving correlated intelligence...

97
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,246
...regarding the illicit activities of
a bank based out of Luxembourg...

98
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,753
...the International Bank
of Business and Credit.

99
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,825
Under the direction of its chairman,
Jonas Skarssen...

100
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,929
...we believe the IBBC has quietly
become the bank of choice...

101
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,998
...for monies associated with
organized crime, capital flight-

102
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,034
How is any of this related to Schumer
and the New York DA's office?

103
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,603
The IBBC's Manhattan branch...

104
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,798
...is the epicenter of its U.S.
money-laundering operation.

105
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,477
Schumer and I
were working this case together.

106
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,273
Agent Salinger and his department
have been assisting us.

107
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,882
Why weren't we informed
of these details prior to this briefing?

108
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,804
What was Schumer doing
here in Berlin?

109
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,768
I set him up on a blind date
with an IBBC executive...

110
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,970
...who was aware of our investigation
and looking to make a deal.

111
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,342
And the identity of this informant?

112
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,077
We don't know. He took precautions
to keep his identity anonymous.

113
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,181
For the past 12 hours,
I've been trying hard to find him.

114
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,518
I believe that if this man isn't
already dead, he soon will be.

115
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,087
Why?

116
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,860
Because, just like Schumer...

117
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,860
...anyone that's in a position
to move against this bank...

118
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,001
...has either ended up dead
or disappeared.

119
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,967
Agent Salinger,
given your history with this matter...

120
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,335
...I should think
you would be more careful...

121
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,977
...before making
such extreme accusations.

122
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,409
My history?
What are you talking about?

123
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,606
We've reviewed your dossier.

124
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,112
Have you?

125
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,048
Well, that means you know
just about shit.

126
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:06,226
I realize this is a trying time
for you both, but until I'm provided...

127
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,629
...with something more compelling
than unsubstantiated theories...

128
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:14,772
...pursuing the IBBC is simply
not going to happen here in Germany.

129
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,183
Concorde Hotel, please.

130
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,159
What was that back there? What
history was Diemer talking about?

131
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,089
- Don't worry.
- Don't give me that shit.

132
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,025
- What do they know that I don't?
- They don't know anything.

133
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,664
Enough to get a rise out of you.

134
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,529
I'm not getting into it.
You're so curious, read my file.

135
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,866
I should never have let Tommy
walk into this.

136
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,442
You didn't. I approved the meet.

137
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,081
I was across the fucking street, Ella.

138
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,112
I was right there.

139
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,320
I saw him go down.

140
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,185
I didn't see a thing.

141
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,297
We won't let them bury this, Lou.

142
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,310
This canvas appeals to you?

143
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,856
I like the look of agony.

144
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,253
Why?

145
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,697
Because I know it's true.

146
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,598
What am I doing here?

147
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,405
Umberto Calvini is disengaging
from the deal.

148
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:44,348
Your principle would like to bring
you in to troubleshoot the situation.

149
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:49,410
If Calvini refuses to move forward, my
involvement won't make a difference.

150
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,955
Your involvement would allow them
to appeal to Calvini's two sons...

151
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,183
...who are much more open-minded.

152
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,428
You'll find all the details in the file.

153
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,566
I'll contact you
once negotiations are underway.

154
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,791
IBBC executive dies
in freak road accident.

155
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,811
Luxembourg high society in shock
at death of André Clément.

156
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,466
Rene?

157
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,695
What are you doing here so early?

158
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,168
Salinger.

159
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,648
I found the insider.

160
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,649
What?

161
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,660
I found the guy that Schumer
met with in Berlin.

162
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,887
André Clément?

163
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,157
The IBBC's senior vice president
of acquisitions.

164
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,200
He was killed in a road accident
just outside Luxembourg...

165
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,638
...approximately nine hours
after Schumer's death.

166
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,540
And this is the gendarmerie's
preliminary accident report.

167
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,976
He arrived in Berlin at 8 am...

168
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,715
...on Luxair, Flight 9871
from Luxembourg.

169
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,745
What doesn't track is in his statement,
the IBBC chairman, Jonas Skarssen...

170
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,359
...claims that Clément had been with
him in Luxembourg since 10 am...

171
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:13,258
...which is obviously impossible
if Clément arrived in Berlin at 8 am.

172
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,566
Did the gendarmerie say anything
about this inconsistency?

173
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,701
Nothing.

174
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,667
- I haven't told them.
- What?

175
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,501
I wanna go to Luxembourg
and question Skarssen myself.

176
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,643
- No. Absolutely no.
- Viktor, listen to me.

177
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,677
I go to Luxembourg,
Skarssen confirms that statement...

178
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,849
...I catch him in that lie,
I can build-

179
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,678
For chrissake, Lou,
you're not at the Yard anymore.

180
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,548
Interpol is not
in the law-enforcement business.

181
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,721
We deal in intelligence
and facilitation.

182
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,389
Focus on that, work that and pass your
take onto the appropriate authorities.

183
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,688
And then what?

184
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,198
You know we've been circulating
our take since the very beginning.

185
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,563
No one ever does anything,
no one ever can.

186
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,434
Whatever case we have gets lost
in the complexities of international law.

187
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,306
Schumer, Clément...

188
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,107
...this entire fucking wall.

189
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,947
There's nothing that complex
about cold-blooded murder.

190
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,933
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Skarssen.

191
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:34,272
- Your name, please?
- Mr. Salinger? Please follow me.

192
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:17,711
Mr. Skarssen.

193
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,856
Mr. Skarssen.

194
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,664
Agent Salinger? Please follow me.

195
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,156
Mr. White.

196
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,655
Agent Salinger.
I apologize for the wait.

197
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,831
I'm Martin White,
the IBBC's legal counsel.

198
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,330
This is Commissioner Villon
of the gendarmerie.

199
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,231
I thought it useful for him to join us,
considering the nature of your query.

200
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,030
Please, have a seat.

201
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,938
I think there's
some misunderstanding.

202
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,942
I'm here to speak with Mr. Skarssen.

203
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:19,413
Yes, but as Mr. Skarssen's attorney,
I insisted that I speak with you first.

204
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,252
Mr. White, I had a confirmed meeting
with Mr. Skarssen at 11:00.

205
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,522
If I was gonna meet with you first,
why didn't anybody tell me?

206
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,319
I understand,
and I'm sorry for the confusion...

207
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,588
...but I'm sure I can help
answer your questions.

208
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,562
Now, please, have a seat.

209
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,483
As I'm sure you're aware...

210
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,919
...I have some questions
regarding André Clément.

211
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,158
Yes.

212
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,828
It's my understanding
that Mr. Clément was working...

213
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,966
...at Mr. Skarssen's residence
the night he was killed.

214
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,658
The night of the accident, yes.

215
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,137
What time did he arrive
at Skarssen's home that day?

216
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,707
If I recall correctly, around 6 pm.

217
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,112
- You were there?
- Yes.

218
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,378
And you're certain about this time?

219
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,877
Quite.

220
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,184
I'm confused.

221
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,423
What you're telling me conflicts
with Skarssen's statement...

222
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,789
...in the gendarmerie's
accident report...

223
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:42,091
...which was that Clément had been
working with him since 10 am.

224
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,433
I was present when Mr. Skarssen
gave his statement.

225
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,663
- That is not what he said.
- It is according to this report.

226
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,136
May I?

227
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,988
There is an error
in the preliminary draft.

228
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,187
The time is wrong.

229
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:19,734
The finalized report here
says Clément arrived at 6 pm.

230
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,341
Clerical errors like this
can happen from time to time.

231
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,010
This is why the gendarmerie
discourages the release...

232
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,408
...of any preliminary documentation
pertaining to open cases.

233
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,078
So is there anything else
we can do for you, Agent Salinger?

234
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:46,586
<i>- Yeah.
- It's me.</i>

235
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,631
<i>I just got the results from
the tox analysis I ran on Schumer.</i>

236
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,827
<i>- And?
- It's inconclusive.</i>

237
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,472
Inconclusive? What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

238
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,234
<i>They found trace elements
of cyanide in his blood...</i>

239
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,536
<i>...but the levels
are not nearly high enough...</i>

240
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,180
<i>...to meet their criteria
for poisoning.</i>

241
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,244
<i>Are you there?</i>

242
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,895
Sorry.

243
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,242
I'm sorry.

244
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,539
Are you crazy?

245
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,100
Madame Clément?

246
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,339
It's Eleanor Whitman from the
New York District Attorney's office.

247
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,479
I already left a couple
messages just-

248
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,862
Mrs. Clément,
I'm sorry to keep calling you.

249
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,506
I can only imagine what a difficult time
this must be for you.

250
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,275
But I'm not convinced your
husband's death was an accident.

251
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,008
Look, here's my cell number.

252
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:49,449
001-917-135-6565.

253
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,053
You can call any time-

254
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:55,716
<i>Stop calling me. I have nothing
to say to you. Just leave me alone.</i>

255
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,725
Please. I just need to ask you
a few questions.

256
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,558
<i>I have two children.
They've already lost their father.</i>

257
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,725
<i>- I understand.
- No, you don't.</i>

258
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,564
Are you aware your husband
met with our investigators...

259
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,504
...the day he was killed?

260
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,350
You ever planning to come to bed?

261
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,714
- I heard your voice.
- I'm sorry.

262
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,358
- When'd he come in here?
- An hour ago.

263
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,823
T.rex was in the closet again.

264
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,162
Let me take him back.

265
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,833
Come on, buddy.

266
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,689
Lou?

267
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,361
They knew about
the discrepancy in the report.

268
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,062
They had Skarssen's
statement changed.

269
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,638
How did they know, Viktor?

270
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:25,867
- Come inside.
- No.

271
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,006
Are you insane? It's freezing out.

272
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,680
Come outside.

273
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,442
Stop it!

274
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,589
Lou, wait.

275
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,187
Lou.

276
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,193
Have you lost your mind?

277
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,650
I think we take the dog for a walk.

278
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,010
Get some fresh air.

279
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,391
Who did this?

280
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:24,932
Who do you think?

281
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,197
From my apartment.

282
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,033
Whitman's got them too.

283
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,975
We need to inform
the secretary general immediately.

284
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,338
You gotta be kidding.

285
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,174
We start setting off alarms,
the opportunity will be lost.

286
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,406
Opportunity?

287
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,208
The last thing Schumer told Ella...

288
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:44,787
...was that Clément was giving him
information on an IBBC arms deal.

289
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,218
Umberto Calvini.

290
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,691
Chairman of Calvini Defense, one
of the largest defense contractors.

291
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,296
And probably
Italy's next prime minister.

292
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,195
This guy standing next to him,
that's our insider.

293
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,263
André Clément.

294
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,595
And?

295
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,673
Whitman found out that Clément
was negotiating for the IBBC...

296
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,242
...to purchase a large number
of missile guidance...

297
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,606
...and control systems
from Calvini Defense.

298
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,214
But at the very last minute,
the deal collapsed.

299
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,406
What happened?

300
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,746
We don't know. Whitman's
meeting me in Milan tomorrow.

301
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,889
We're gonna talk to Calvini
and find out.

302
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,057
- Hey.
- Hey.

303
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,294
Eleanor Whitman,
this is Inspector Alberto Cerutti.

304
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,523
- Charmed.
- Nice to meet you.

305
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,099
Please, there's not much time.

306
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,930
Calvini leaves for Turin
immediately after this engagement.

307
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,629
I didn't realize we were meeting
at a political rally.

308
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,435
Best we could do
on such short notice.

309
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,649
Thirtieth floor. I'll be waiting outside.

310
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,725
You need to press the button.

311
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,592
You look awful.

312
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,771
Thanks.

313
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,701
When was the last time
you got any sleep?

314
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,771
Don't know.

315
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,976
When was the last time
you had a healthy meal?

316
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,111
Can't remember.

317
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:06,489
- How about the last time you got laid?
- Why, are you offering?

318
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,751
You need to take better care
of yourself, Lou.

319
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:14,762
I can't have you crash and burn
like you did two years ago.

320
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,131
Please follow me.

321
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,902
This meeting is strictly off the record.

322
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,405
Mr. Calvini cannot be entangled
in your investigation...

323
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,569
...nor can his participation in this
discussion find its way to the press.

324
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,770
We understand.

325
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,816
Wait here for a moment.

326
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,850
So you read my file.

327
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,483
I made a few calls to London.

328
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,584
You should've told me everything...

329
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,696
...with your IBBC case at the Yard.
You should've told me it's why you left.

330
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,197
What did they tell you?

331
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,127
That you screwed up because
the witness you brought in was a joke.

332
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,171
And when you were forced to
drop him, the case fell apart.

333
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,707
You flipped out, attacked the assistant
commissioner and broke his nose.

334
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,472
My case did not fall apart, it was shut
down, and my witness was rock-solid.

335
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,614
He gave us everything we needed
against the bank...

336
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,117
...and then suddenly, out of nowhere,
my AC forced me to cut him loose.

337
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,051
Three days later,
they all died in a car crash.

338
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,651
- "They"?
- He had a wife and two kids.

339
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,793
Mr. Calvini, we'd like to know
why the IBBC, a bank...

340
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,267
...would be purchasing millions
of dollars worth of missile guidance...

341
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,303
...and control systems
from your company.

342
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,207
The IBBC has purchased
billions of dollars worth...

343
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:39,315
...of Silkworm missiles from
the People's Republic of China...

344
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,645
...which they have presold
to clients in the Middle East...

345
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,412
...contingent upon the missiles...

346
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,250
...being equipped
with VOLCON guidance systems.

347
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:52,262
My company's one of only two in the
world which produce the VOLCON.

348
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:56,729
- Who's the other?
- Sunay. Ahmet Sunay.

349
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,526
Of Turkish Aerotech?

350
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,105
But why is the bank committing
so much capital and resources...

351
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,502
...to the sale of these missiles?

352
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:10,836
It's a test.

353
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,713
Small arms
are the only weapons used...

354
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,218
...in 99 percent
of the world's conflicts...

355
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,358
...and no one has the capacity
to manufacture them...

356
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,357
...faster and cheaper than China.

357
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,227
What Skarssen is attempting to do...

358
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,792
...is to make the IBBC
the exclusive broker...

359
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,638
...of Chinese small arms
to the Third World.

360
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,470
And the missile deal
is the gateway transaction.

361
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,607
Yeah, but billions of dollars invested
simply to be a broker?

362
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,475
There can't be much profit for them.

363
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:48,379
No. This is not about making profit
from weapon sales.

364
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,213
It's about control.

365
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:57,392
Control the flow of weapons,
control the conflict.

366
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,994
No.

367
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,762
No, no. The IBBC is a bank.

368
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,703
Their objective isn't
to control the conflict...

369
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:10,271
...it's to control the debt
that the conflict produces.

370
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:14,243
You see, the real value
of a conflict...

371
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,742
...the true value...

372
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,978
...is in the debt that it creates.

373
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,413
You control the debt...

374
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,346
...you control everything.

375
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,855
You find this upsetting, yes?

376
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,223
But this is the very essence
of the banking industry...

377
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:38,629
...to make us all,
whether we be nations or individuals...

378
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,134
...slaves to debt.

379
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,802
You sound like
you're not very fond of the IBBC.

380
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,875
What happened?

381
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,607
I was fond of André Clément.

382
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,283
I trusted him...

383
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,146
...and he was a good friend.

384
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:07,393
Then help us make sure
he didn't die in vain.

385
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,167
Find me after the speech.

386
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,803
We can talk in the car
on my way to the airport.

387
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,453
Umberto Calvini.

388
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,847
Definitely connected to any-

389
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,425
What the hell is going on?

390
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,157
They shot him!

391
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,189
Secure this area
and block all exits, now.

392
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,989
Go!

393
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,093
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

394
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,286
I think so.

395
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,762
Take that left.
Maybe you can cut him off.

396
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,434
Go.

397
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,160
Go!

398
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,694
Turn off the engine...

399
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:25,273
...and stick your hands
out of the window!

400
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,438
Turn off the engine...

401
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,671
...and stick your hands
out of the window! Now!

402
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:52,629
Our relationship with the Swiss has
become impossible over the past year.

403
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,770
They are discounting
our dollar deposits...

404
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,338
...by 160 basis points below par.

405
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,805
They have doubled the cost
of moving our money.

406
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,740
Well, general, what do you expect?

407
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,777
You've been in the jungle
long enough...

408
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,008
...to know that when the lion kills,
it's the jackal that profits.

409
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,685
Yes.

410
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,185
The IBBC is specifically structured...

411
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,256
...to handle the particular needs
of your type of organization.

412
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,785
We can give you better rates
and terms than other competitors...

413
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,421
...but we can offer you much more:

414
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,288
Weapons...

415
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,235
...intelligence, logistical support...

416
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,837
...everything that
the Revolutionary Freedom Front...

417
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,030
...would need to revive itself.

418
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,436
But in exchange for what?

419
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:37,136
You must understand,
the RFF has no money.

420
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:45,113
Money is not this institution's
primary medium of exchange.

421
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,083
What are you proposing exactly?

422
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,696
We believe that, with the right kind
of direction and support...

423
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,992
...the RFF could become a very
influential force in your country.

424
00:43:58,602 --> 00:43:59,830
Perhaps potent enough...

425
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:03,234
...to stage a successful coup
in the coming months.

426
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,571
And if this were possible...

427
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,913
...what does your bank
hope to gain from it?

428
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:18,049
The gratitude and consideration
of a very influential friend.

429
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,486
Excuse me.

430
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,687
Mr. White and Mr. Ehames
asked me to interrupt.

431
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,260
Would you excuse me, general?
I'll be right back.

432
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:43,743
What is it?

433
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:52,486
Approximately 30 minutes ago,
Umberto Calvini was assassinated...

434
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,921
...while giving a speech
at a political rally in Milan.

435
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,887
We've been discussing it.

436
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,767
I think we should wait until
the authorities resolve the matter...

437
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:08,369
...and then approach the sons
to revive negotiations.

438
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,097
How long will this take?

439
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:14,209
I've been assured the investigation
will move swiftly...

440
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:19,512
...but unexpected fallout of an event
like this can always complicate things.

441
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,151
We only have 60 days left
to deliver the worms.

442
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,910
There's no time for complications.

443
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,215
That's a risk you take
with such an ambitious agenda.

444
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:30,827
I don't foresee any problems.
Had it not been for their father...

445
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:34,020
...Mario and Enzo Calvini
would have made our deal long ago.

446
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,631
Now there's no reason
for them not to move forward.

447
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:41,066
An important man and devoted father
has just been killed.

448
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,708
I suggest that we send a letter
to Calvini's family...

449
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,868
...extending our heartfelt prayers
and condolences for their terrible loss.

450
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,705
I don't know, but I'm okay.

451
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,282
The doctors
checked me out thoroughly.

452
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,919
Kiss Jake for me, will you?

453
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,592
So the shooter was identified
as a member of the Red Brigade.

454
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,494
What about the guy in the car?

455
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,898
Car was stolen. They were unable
to lift prints, fibers or residue...

456
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,335
...or locate any witnesses
who saw him exiting the vehicle.

457
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,600
- So?
- So the carabinieri are announcing...

458
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,675
...that the Red Brigade
was responsible...

459
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,473
...for the assassination
at the press conference tonight.

460
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:26,911
We're not convinced
the Red Brigade's behind this.

461
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,847
Someone could simply be
making it appear as though they are.

462
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,587
This isn't my case...

463
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,759
...and the man in charge
of the investigation is very powerful...

464
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,153
...and a real bastard.

465
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:40,626
All we wanna do
is just look around a little.

466
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,381
- Antonio.
- Alberto.

467
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,220
Just a moment.

468
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,986
They done
the trajectory analysis yet?

469
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,214
Cerutti said no.

470
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,501
If there was a second shooter,
he could've positioned himself here.

471
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,004
The stopwatch they found
in the room...

472
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,235
...it was set on
a one-minute countdown, yes?

473
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,904
Right. Calvini was killed a little
over one minute into his speech.

474
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:16,151
What if this was all synchronized?

475
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,618
Okay...

476
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,122
...let's say I'm the second shooter.

477
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,291
<i>The guy below
doesn't know I'm here...</i>

478
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:31,126
<i>...but I'm positioned
right above his room.</i>

479
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:36,099
<i>I'm armed with a Sauer 200 rifle,
just like he is.</i>

480
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,441
I have a stopwatch set
on a one-minute countdown...

481
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,009
<i>...which I start when Calvini
begins his speech.</i>

482
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,680
The sniper below has been instructed
to do the same...

483
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,543
...because that's when
he's gonna fire his first bullet.

484
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:52,051
If he misses, I'm ready to
follow through with one of my own.

485
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,948
The sniper fires, misses.

486
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,724
<i>Seconds later...</i>

487
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:59,791
...I take Calvini out with a headshot.

488
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:04,093
It's a good theory,
but there's one problem.

489
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:05,962
Why?

490
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:11,006
Two shots were fired
from the window...

491
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,971
<i>...two slugs were recovered...</i>

492
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,474
...and two casings were found
next to the gun...

493
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,240
...ballistics confirming that the casings
came from the gun in the hotel room.

494
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:22,509
<i>So if the kill shot came from
a second shooter here on the roof...</i>

495
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,381
...that'd be a total
of three bullets fired.

496
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,887
How do you explain
the absence of the third bullet?

497
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,290
I can't.

498
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,957
I think I've seen this print before.

499
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,184
Where?

500
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,124
Hanging on the wall of my office.

501
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:26,378
So this was lifted from the scene of the
Stefan Heuss hit in Brussels last year.

502
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,676
A former IMF executive director.

503
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,115
Has he ever seen
a tread pattern like this before?

504
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:43,493
He believes it came from
a custom shoe made for a leg brace.

505
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,725
The braces are typically
made out of steel...

506
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,904
...or alloy,
but the condition of the leg...

507
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,471
...would determine the specific
type of device used.

508
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,904
He says that the prints
are a probable match.

509
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,050
Please get these over to Alan Kovacs
at FBI Impressions right away...

510
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,947
...and make sure
he has my contact numbers.

511
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,582
Thanks.

512
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,320
Ella, if the FBI confirms
that these prints are a match...

513
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,927
...it means the bank's
used the same assassin twice.

514
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:17,799
Which means if we can get him,
we can get the bank.

515
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,631
What was that?

516
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,902
<i>That was Capitano Barillo, the man
in charge of the Calvini investigation.</i>

517
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:05,309
- What did he want?
- My ass on a platter...

518
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,813
...and both of you
on the next flight out of Milan.

519
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,186
Didn't you tell him
what we just found?

520
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,854
I tried.

521
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:15,047
Fuck him.
He can't force us to leave.

522
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:17,852
He has already spoken
to your superiors.

523
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,188
You have both been ordered home.

524
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,894
Arnie, you can't just sit there...

525
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,192
...and lecture me
about protocol and procedure.

526
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,165
You know what's happening here.

527
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,861
Well, who gives a shit
about jurisdictional provenance?

528
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,268
We just had a major breakthrough.

529
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,343
That's great, Arnie.
You're a real stand-up guy.

530
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,673
This is total bullshit.

531
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:41,182
I wish I could have
been more helpful.

532
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,318
Oh, no, you've been great, Alberto.

533
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,455
I'm gonna do everything I can
to take the heat off you.

534
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,322
Thanks.

535
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,693
Thanks for everything.
Sorry for all the trouble we caused.

536
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,030
What?

537
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,643
His leg brace would be made
of metal, right?

538
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:12,209
- So?
- So if he left through an airport...

539
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,610
...security would have made him
show it to them.

540
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,462
That's definitely him.

541
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:39,335
- He doesn't look like much.
- I think that's the idea.

542
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,737
Seems to know
where the cameras are.

543
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,914
Look how he always angles his face
just out of our line of sight.

544
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,514
Even if you do find him...

545
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:49,913
...that's not enough evidence to
convict the man without a confession.

546
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,351
If we find him, prosecution will be
irrelevant. He'll be a marked man.

547
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:56,286
He can either die for the bank
or flip for us.

548
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:01,664
I got him. He is traveling under
the name Sherwood, Timothy M.

549
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:05,995
He boarded Flight Alitalia 422,
departing Milan at 6 pm yesterday...

550
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:08,636
...and arriving in New York
at JFK at 10 pm.

551
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,009
What time's the next flight
to New York?

552
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,016
Detectives Hubbard, Ward, Ornelas,
this is Agent Lou Salinger.

553
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,278
- Finally.
- How you doing?

554
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,013
- Let me take that.
- Thanks. So, what do we have?

555
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,350
Well, we got lucky.

556
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:06,161
Some clip shots of him
moving through customs.

557
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,194
That's a good one.

558
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:13,658
The Sherwood ID he used? It's clean.
All of it attached to a dead address.

559
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,667
Where'd he go
after he cleared customs?

560
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,705
Don't know.
CCTV footage lost him at the curb.

561
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,900
We canvassed all the limousine
and taxicab companies in the city.

562
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:26,014
Airport parking, rental agencies.
Didn't come up with shit.

563
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,275
There's a chance
he might live in the city.

564
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:29,611
Why is that?

565
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,686
Kovacs from FBI Impressions called.

566
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:37,952
"The footprint was left by a shoe
used for knee-ankle-foot orthosis.

567
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:41,125
The tread pattern is exclusive
to shoes produced...

568
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,596
...at the Isaacson Orthopedic Institute
here in the city. "

569
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,735
The shoe could have only come
from there.

570
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,097
Do you have a contact person
to run down?
