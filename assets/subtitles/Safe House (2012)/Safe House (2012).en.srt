9,531 --> 00:01:33,206
I'm going to talk to
Parker about my promotion today.

2
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:38,110
In the worst-case scenario
you're two weeks ahead of me,

3
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:41,279
you get a gorgeous little
apartment in the Marais.

4
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:43,790
What if I don't want
to live in the Marais?

5
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:48,385
We could live
somewhere else, then.

6
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:50,863
Yeah?
Yeah.

7
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:52,491
We could go to Detroit.

8
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:53,591
Detroit?

9
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:55,796
Yeah, you could
meet my mom and dad.

10
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:00,100
You can meet my sister.
She owns a bakery,

11
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,174
and she will
make you fat.

12
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:17,325
I have six hours before I have
to go back to the hospital.

13
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,863
You want to go
back into bed with me?

14
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:24,763
I do.

15
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:28,868
But I got back-to-back
meetings all morning.

16
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:31,475
Too bad for you.

17
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:32,943
Yeah, I know.

18
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:34,636
But I got to get in.

19
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:35,738
There's probably
already 25 people

20
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:37,511
lined up outside
the door, waiting.

21
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:47,453
I love when
you speak French.

22
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,607
Satcom check.

23
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:07,707
Echo Nine Three
Victor Echo Two.

24
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,675
Ops Center.

25
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:11,915
This is safe house 7-R.
We're open for business.

26
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:13,013
Confirmed.

27
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,752
Any reservations?

28
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:16,020
Nothing in
the registry.

29
00:03:16,082 --> 00:03:17,254
Walk-ins?

30
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:20,263
Not expected.
Reconfirm in three hours.

31
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,890
Understood.

32
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:39,785
Matt?
Your cell, really?

33
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:42,914
Relax, I've got
an encryption packet.

34
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,986
You know me,
I never relax.

35
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:47,186
Watch the cholesterol,
old man.

36
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,593
You sound like Miriam.

37
00:03:48,652 --> 00:03:50,325
So, what's new
in Cape Town?

38
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:51,491
Nothing, nothing.

39
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:54,194
I updated my Surveillance Target Analysis.
It's complete now.

40
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,601
Yeah, that's an exit report.
It's not due until you leave.

41
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:59,642
Exactly. Exactly.
And when is that?

42
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,767
How long has it been?

43
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,435
Twelve months.

44
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,309
Well, talk to me
in another four.

45
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,815
David, I'm dying here.

46
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:08,842
What's happening
with the post in Paris?

47
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,118
One slot,
37 applicants.

48
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,553
Every one of them with more
field experience than you.

49
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:15,490
How am I supposed to
get more experience?

50
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:17,653
I'm staring at
four walls all day.

51
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:20,362
I got passed up on Rome,
then Berlin.

52
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,990
You said yourself, my
evaluation was excellent.

53
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:23,865
Just put it in
front of Whitford.

54
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:26,427
I know he'll see that I'm
ready to go, I'm all in.

55
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,266
Matt, I know
this has been hard,

56
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,332
but it's the way
the system works.

57
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:34,910
Look, I'll talk to Whitford about
Paris, but I can't promise anything.

58
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,072
Look, I've got to go.

59
00:04:38,273 --> 00:04:40,844
Don't worry,
I'm looking after you, okay?

60
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:43,622
Yeah, I know,
I know, I know.

61
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,089
This is not a negotiation.

62
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,531
It's 10 million.

63
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,337
You'll get the file,
and if the money

64
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,136
is not in the account
by 3:00 p.m.

65
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:32,071
I'll take it
to another buyer.

66
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,340
How do we know
that you won't do that anyway?

67
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,582
You don't.

68
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:56,594
Here you are, sir.

69
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:01,508
Alec, how are you?

70
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:10,118
Petrus, 1972.

71
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,944
You look good.

72
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:14,251
I do, don't I?

73
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:19,028
So, how are things
at MI6?

74
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:23,157
The usual. Same bureaucratic
bullshit and appalling remuneration.

75
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:24,327
Life of a government man.

76
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:25,461
Mmm-hmm.

77
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,667
So...

78
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:35,441
The original file.

79
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:38,307
Dates,
transactions, names.

80
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:40,045
A bargain
at triple the price.

81
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,516
Take a look.

82
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:44,046
Hmm.

83
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:50,520
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

84
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,595
Tobin...

85
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:57,931
What's in that box
is going to make

86
00:06:57,995 --> 00:06:59,338
the world
a smaller place for you,

87
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:00,568
for both of us.

88
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:04,602
I got your account.

89
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:07,205
You get your cut
24 hours after transaction.

90
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:08,842
Some of our old bosses
aren't going to be happy

91
00:07:08,907 --> 00:07:10,750
these files are out
in the open.

92
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:13,486
Do I make you nervous?

93
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:16,822
Always.
Good.

94
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:45,146
You want her?

95
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,017
Please, listen to me.

96
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:44,314
I had nothing to do
with this.

97
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:45,653
Stop.

98
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:54,057
Let's go.

99
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:04,410
Tobin, you have
to believe me.

100
00:10:04,468 --> 00:10:07,039
I knew nothing
about any of that.

101
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,709
Did you know if
anybody was following you?

102
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:11,913
No, I don't think
anybody was following me.

103
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:13,649
I swear on my life,
Tobin, I had absolutely...

104
00:10:57,894 --> 00:10:58,895
Slow down.

105
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:20,691
We're going by foot.

106
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:22,732
Head towards the square.

107
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:32,170
Move! Move! Move!

108
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:42,285
We're heading west.

109
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:44,751
Holland Street.
Move, move.

110
00:13:19,118 --> 00:13:20,722
Excuse me, sir.
Thank you.

111
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,020
My name is Tobin Frost.

112
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:52,360
Link later.

113
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,126
When?

114
00:13:58,528 --> 00:13:59,666
Lock down the consulate.

115
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,310
Get me a team in the Situation
Room in five minutes.

116
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:03,811
I want everything we got
on Tobin Frost.

117
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:04,868
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:10,318
Is it him?
Yep.

119
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:11,409
Whitford know?

120
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,819
I'm on my way there now.

121
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,928
Sir, place your finger in
there until I tell you to stop.

122
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,392
Thank you.

123
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:31,107
So how long has he been
playing in your backyard?

124
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:33,041
We're working to get you
that answer right now.

125
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,134
Meaning you don't know.

126
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:35,608
No, meaning,
we're looking into it.

127
00:14:36,236 --> 00:14:38,443
The guy goes rogue,
he spends nine years

128
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:40,213
selling out the Agency
to all takers.

129
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:42,345
To Russia, China, Iran,
you name it.

130
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,187
The guy is just not
going to prance

131
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,350
into an American consulate
without good reason.

132
00:14:49,518 --> 00:14:51,156
All right, listen up.

133
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,460
Everybody off the phone.

134
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:57,301
Tobin Frost has
just waltzed his way

135
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,806
into a U.S. Consulate
in Cape Town, South Africa.

136
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:01,970
Now this man,
without question,

137
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:04,137
is one of the most notorious
traders that we've got.

138
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:06,172
Errington, call up
his background profile.

139
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:11,917
Tobin Frost was
recruited into the Agency in 1984.

140
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:15,047
He tested off the charts in aptitude
for psychological field work.

141
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,818
His first assignment was in
Lebanon, in January, 1985.

142
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:21,322
Three months later,
he captured and flipped

143
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:22,660
a high-ranking
Hezbollah leader.

144
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:24,895
Over the next
several years,

145
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,700
Frost successfully questioned and
recruited many high-value individuals.

146
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,708
He became known as an expert
manipulator of human assets,

147
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,608
and he literally rewrote Agency
interrogation protocols.

148
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,204
Frost served
in many active theaters,

149
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,149
including Libya
from 1995 to 1998,

150
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:40,844
Jordan, 1998 to 2000.

151
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:42,552
During his tenure
in Jordan,

152
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,521
Frost was suspected of leaking
information to Mossad,

153
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,718
but nothing
was confirmed.

154
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:49,159
Ten years ago, Frost went off
the reservation completely.

155
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:51,197
He currently
has no allegiances

156
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:53,859
and is wanted for espionage
on four continents.

157
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:57,768
His last known sighting
is Hamburg, Germany, in 2011.

158
00:15:57,827 --> 00:16:01,104
You know, Harlan, we should
interrogate Frost now.

159
00:16:01,164 --> 00:16:02,609
Sweat him for
everything he's got.

160
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,703
Once he's stateside,
we have fewer options.

161
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:06,839
I have an interrogator in Yemen,
can be there in eight hours.

162
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:09,110
I already have a team in Jo'burg
that can be there in two.

163
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:11,050
We'll take Frost to the safe
house, interrogate him there.

164
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:13,020
My people are fully
capable of handling this.

165
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:14,852
This is Tobin Frost.

166
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,561
We'll go with Jo'burg.

167
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:23,522
Okay.

168
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:30,069
You must turn around.

169
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,937
Help. Help.

170
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,280
Accident.

171
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,421
Housekeeping.

172
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:55,934
We have
a last-minute reservation.

173
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:57,300
ETA for check-in?

174
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,931
Sometime tonight.
Freeark Insurance.

175
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:01,304
Got it.

176
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:08,710
Hello.
Hey.

177
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:09,773
Hey, where are you?

178
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,350
Parker just handed me
his oversight papers to finish

179
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,016
and his daughter Chloe's got the
measles, can you believe that?

180
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,825
How long are you
going to be out for?

181
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:19,225
I don't know.
I don't know.

182
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:20,957
Okay. Well, look,
I'm gonna dive into this,

183
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,660
and then hopefully I can meet
up with you later, okay?

184
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:24,996
Yeah, that sounds good.

185
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:26,195
Hey, hey...

186
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:29,395
I love you.

187
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:31,066
I love you, too.

188
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:33,468
Bye.
Bye.

189
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,726
Extraction team
is in the air, sir.

190
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:52,288
They should be on the
ground within the hour.

191
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:54,766
I want that team in and out of
the city in less than 12 hours.

192
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,191
We're not even
supposed to have

193
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:57,828
a presence in Cape Town.
Yes, sir.

194
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:03,037
Any communications about Frost's
whereabouts are strictly need-to-know.

195
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:13,888
Sir, the extraction team is en
route to the consulate now.

196
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:21,395
Who's reaching out
to 7-R?

197
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:22,659
Richards, ma'am.

198
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,132
I want
the housekeeper briefed.

199
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:26,226
High-priority target is coming in.
I want the house quiet.

200
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:27,566
Under no circumstances
should there be

201
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:29,231
any communication
until the team has left.

202
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:30,599
Yes, ma'am.

203
00:19:01,331 --> 00:19:02,332
Yeah?

204
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:03,503
Do you have a room?

205
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:04,874
Account?
Daniel Kiefer.

206
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:07,744
Freeark Insurance.
K- I-E-F-E-R.

207
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:12,146
Kiefer. Freeark Insurance.
K- I-E-F-E-R.

208
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:13,210
You are a go.

209
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,279
You're good to go.

210
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,269
Hi, I'm Weston.
Guest room?

211
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:36,070
It's right around the corner.
Two rights and a left.

212
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:37,672
All the way back.

213
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:02,205
That's Tobin Frost.

214
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:04,608
Stay with him. Let's
go download our gear.

215
00:20:04,668 --> 00:20:05,669
Yes, sir.

216
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,460
Linen closet?

217
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,365
Down the hall. Just right
at the end, there.

218
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,404
Kill all the surveillance
cameras in this room.

219
00:20:52,854 --> 00:20:54,299
My name is Daniel Kiefer.

220
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,197
We were at
The Farm together.

221
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:02,209
Technically,
you were a year ahead.

222
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:08,638
I'm here to make you
aware of your rights.

223
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,042
You're being held under
a National Security Directive,

224
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:13,816
which means you have none,
but you know that.

225
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:14,878
Six-hundreds.

226
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:18,826
The towels,
you need six-hundreds.

227
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:22,421
Those are 350,
375-gram weight.

228
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:26,096
You're gonna
need six-hundreds.

229
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:34,573
I want to know the reasons
for you being in Cape Town.

230
00:21:35,802 --> 00:21:39,511
I want you to name your
resources, contacts, assets,

231
00:21:39,573 --> 00:21:41,018
everybody you've
done business with,

232
00:21:41,074 --> 00:21:42,712
traded intel with,
sold secrets to,

233
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:45,484
in the nine years since you
betrayed your country.

234
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:49,521
Absolutely.
Anything you want, Daniel.

235
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:58,865
Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed lasted 20 seconds.

236
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:01,172
They had six-hundreds.

237
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:21,822
Is this legal?

238
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:31,337
Bring him down.

239
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:57,863
Bring him up.

240
00:23:12,776 --> 00:23:13,982
How long was that?

241
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:23,431
All right,
take him down.

242
00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:42,342
Bring him up!

243
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,263
Get me a knife.

244
00:24:06,102 --> 00:24:07,103
Miller?

245
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:17,385
Get in there
with Frost.

246
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:18,926
Sir, all the security cameras
are down.

247
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:20,929
Reboot. I want to see what's out there
Copy that.

248
00:24:22,186 --> 00:24:23,187
Let's go, boys!

249
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:25,392
Go! Go! Go!

250
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,262
Let's go, move!

251
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:35,970
Velez, take this corner.

252
00:24:36,503 --> 00:24:38,574
Ericksson,
get the back elevator.

253
00:24:44,611 --> 00:24:45,988
Pope, what do you got?

254
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:50,359
Sir, I see approximately 12
heavily armed men in perimeter two.

255
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:53,058
Okay, gents!
Work fore to aft.

256
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,066
Two-by-twos.
Perimeter two.

257
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,509
Greer?
Sir!

258
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:06,076
Ericksson?
Yes, sir.

259
00:25:06,502 --> 00:25:07,708
Velez?

260
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:10,711
Velez?

261
00:25:10,773 --> 00:25:12,081
I'm good!

262
00:25:13,444 --> 00:25:14,889
Let's go, fellas.

263
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:34,236
Incoming!
Grenade!

264
00:25:51,252 --> 00:25:52,788
Greer!

265
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:56,231
Step-slide!
Start walking back!

266
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:01,798
Velez!
Three-round bursts!

267
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,814
Velez, where's Greer?

268
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,120
He's over there, sir.

269
00:26:17,815 --> 00:26:18,816
Go, son.

270
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:30,638
This ain't a test.
This is the real thing.

271
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:35,902
What are you
gonna do?

272
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,539
You don't want
to try me.

273
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:47,220
Magazine!
Let's go.

274
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:55,167
Velez, stay there!

275
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:57,168
Listen to me
stay there!

276
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:03,799
Son of a bitch!

277
00:27:12,209 --> 00:27:13,210
Miller!

278
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:17,214
Miller!

279
00:27:18,682 --> 00:27:20,127
Hey! Get in here!

280
00:27:23,154 --> 00:27:24,929
Hey, hey. Take these.

281
00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:26,400
Go watch him.

282
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:45,054
Hey, they're here for me,
but they want me alive.

283
00:27:45,111 --> 00:27:46,215
You, they'll kill.

284
00:27:51,085 --> 00:27:52,120
You got one
in the chamber?

285
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,399
It's okay.

286
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:01,335
I remember my first posting.
Rio de Janeiro.

287
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:04,070
A house like this.
Beautiful women.

288
00:28:04,132 --> 00:28:06,578
Not one single visitor, but
I remember rule number one.

289
00:28:06,636 --> 00:28:08,673
You are responsible
for your houseguest.

290
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:09,739
I'm your houseguest.

291
00:28:14,878 --> 00:28:18,587
The clock is ticking.
They gave you the keys.

292
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:19,719
Do your duty, son.

293
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:22,429
Shut up. Let me think.

294
00:28:26,724 --> 00:28:28,533
You want to be the guy
that lost Tobin Frost?

295
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:36,639
Tick-took,
tick-took, tick-took.

296
00:29:00,295 --> 00:29:02,036
Where's Frost?

297
00:29:25,824 --> 00:29:27,303
We're leaving.

298
00:29:44,911 --> 00:29:46,219
Where is he?

299
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:06,874
Stay here, stay here!
Wait! Don't move!

300
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:11,573
Hey, hey, hey!

301
00:30:18,114 --> 00:30:19,115
Go!

302
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:23,687
Get in the trunk.

303
00:30:23,754 --> 00:30:25,791
Are you serious?
Yeah, get in.

304
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:27,767
The trunk?
Get in the trunk now!

305
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,951
No!

306
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:10,973
Ops Center.

307
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,247
Echo Three
Victor Echo Nine.

308
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:14,310
Go ahead.

309
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:16,754
This is Weston. 7-R's been hit.
Everyone's dead.

310
00:31:17,347 --> 00:31:19,088
I need you to repeat that, please.
Say again.

311
00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:22,289
Kiefer, his team, everyone,
they're all dead.

312
00:31:22,352 --> 00:31:23,626
Stand by.

313
00:31:25,756 --> 00:31:26,757
Transferring.

314
00:31:27,758 --> 00:31:29,863
It's the house.

315
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:33,033
Linklater.
This is Weston.

316
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:34,577
The safe house
has been breached.

317
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:37,407
What's your location?

318
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:39,515
I'm eastbound
on Albert Road.

319
00:31:39,571 --> 00:31:42,074
I'm just
passing Woodstock.

320
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,881
I want eyes on this.
Real-time sat feed.

321
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:48,849
And what's
the location of the guest?

322
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,458
We escaped.

323
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:52,190
Clarify.
Do you have the guest?

324
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:53,558
Yes, we escaped!

325
00:31:54,388 --> 00:31:55,992
Look, I can make it
to the consulate.

326
00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:57,330
There's no chance
for SDR,

327
00:31:57,391 --> 00:31:58,631
I think I might have
picked up a tail.

328
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:00,902
We can't have a gun battle
in front of the consulate.

329
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,473
Diplomatic catastrophe.

330
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:05,267
Where's that
satellite feed?

331
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,472
Denied by National Recon
War theater use only.

332
00:32:08,436 --> 00:32:10,143
Buy us some time.

333
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,248
Do not go
to the consulate.

334
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:16,857
Follow protocol
Alpha Zero.

335
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,558
Secure the guest
and stay off the grid.

336
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:23,797
Reconnect at 1800 hours.
I repeat, stay off the grid.

337
00:32:24,388 --> 00:32:26,061
Copy. copy. copy.

338
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,114
All right, Cape Town police
have responded to the house.

339
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,412
Confirmed.
I want the site secured.

340
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,474
I'm hearing nine dead.

341
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,181
Initiating damage control.

342
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,016
I'm on it.
Reaching out to NIA now.

343
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:49,053
The locals are going to
have that house locked off.

344
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:53,088
Check all the traffic
cameras, police reports...

345
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,829
Find out why Frost wanted to go
in that consulate to begin with

346
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:58,461
and who in the hell else
might be after him.

347
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:03,401
We need to get Weston and
Frost out of South Africa.

348
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:06,239
Now, do we have any tactical teams?
Anything in play?

349
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:08,713
Yeah, I have assets in
Egypt, but they're in deep.

350
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,114
If I pull them out, that would
compromise two years' worth of work.

351
00:36:11,173 --> 00:36:12,743
I can scramble a team
from Europe or Asia,

352
00:36:12,808 --> 00:36:15,015
but it's going to
take at least 18 hours.

353
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:19,221
At this point,
Weston is all we got.

354
00:36:22,853 --> 00:36:26,198
I need to find out who this
Matt Weston is, right now.

355
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,335
Matthew James Weston.

356
00:36:30,194 --> 00:36:33,334
Born 02-24-82 to
Terry and Madeline Weston

357
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:35,241
in Port Washington,
New York.

358
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,640
An assault arrest,
one month after

359
00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:37,771
both parents and
a younger sister

360
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:39,509
were killed in
a traffic accident

361
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:41,175
in which his
father's blood-alcohol

362
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,947
was twice
the legal limit.

363
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,621
Yale, degree in Economics,
recruited out of Yale law.

364
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:49,927
High marks in analytics
and linguistics at The Farm.

365
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:52,494
Excellent in
tradecraft skills.

366
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:55,624
His girlfriend, Ana Moreau,
is a French national.

367
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:59,859
He reported them as having
"close and continuing contact. "

368
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,806
She's a second year resident in the
oncology department at Groote Schuur.

369
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:03,865
Get in that car.

370
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:06,070
She accepted a
position with Hotel-Dieu Hospital

371
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:07,806
in Paris,
starts in two weeks.

372
00:37:08,203 --> 00:37:10,581
No known political
affiliations. She's clean.

373
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,251
I want you to post a car
outside their apartment.

374
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:14,810
Use back channels.

375
00:37:14,877 --> 00:37:18,689
And get NSA to cross-check their telephone
records and their e-mails, please.

376
00:37:18,748 --> 00:37:19,749
Yes, ma'am.

377
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,076
You know, it would be easier
if I knew where we were going.

378
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:38,307
You just drive, all right?
Just drive, middle lane.

379
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,542
All right.

380
00:37:40,972 --> 00:37:43,714
Hey, what are you doing?
Middle lane.

381
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:46,846
Just drive around.

382
00:37:46,913 --> 00:37:49,052
All right.
I'm driving.

383
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,622
Nice to know who you're talking to.
What's your name?

384
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:57,931
You crushed my windpipe.

385
00:37:57,991 --> 00:37:59,993
Well, you locked me
in the trunk.

386
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,540
Come on, you're not NOC. You're
here under your real name.

387
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,601
What is it?

388
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:07,806
Weston, Matt.

389
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,507
All right.

390
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:11,380
How long you been
a safe house keeper?

391
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,441
Twelve months.

392
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:13,646
Happy birthday.

393
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,324
Cape Town,
that's low-level detail.

394
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,054
You should have been
out of here by now.

395
00:38:21,284 --> 00:38:23,230
Maybe I requested
the assignment.

396
00:38:24,454 --> 00:38:27,901
Or maybe Langley doesn't trust
you with anything else.

397
00:38:30,795 --> 00:38:32,433
So, what's your plan?

398
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:35,541
Oh, let me guess.
Follow protocol.

399
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,773
Protocol states that
if your house is crashed,

400
00:38:37,835 --> 00:38:40,645
you do an SDR to make sure
no one's following you.

401
00:38:41,073 --> 00:38:44,953
Activate your GPS in your Go-Bag,
select another safe house.

402
00:38:46,712 --> 00:38:49,056
You think I'm going to
let you just take me in?

403
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:50,623
I think you need
to shut up.

404
00:38:51,818 --> 00:38:54,526
I think you need to consider how your
house was attacked in the first place.

405
00:38:54,587 --> 00:38:56,589
Have you done that, Matt?

406
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,172
They followed Kiefer. They
followed him from the consulate,

407
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:03,333
and that's how they
found the safe house.

408
00:39:03,397 --> 00:39:05,035
Come on, you don't really
believe that, do you?

409
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:08,603
How did they know I was near the
consulate in the first place?

410
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:11,943
Hmm.

411
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,349
But I like this, you know.
You and me, figuring shit out.

412
00:39:16,212 --> 00:39:18,351
Like the Hardy Boys.

413
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:22,486
That house was
a secure location.

414
00:39:22,551 --> 00:39:23,928
Whoever crashed it

415
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:28,163
didn't stop by a gas station and ask for
directions to the nearest safe house.

416
00:39:28,225 --> 00:39:30,535
They were invited. Someone
told them, Matthew.

417
00:39:30,627 --> 00:39:32,903
Think about it.
Someone you know.

418
00:39:32,964 --> 00:39:35,706
So you better ask yourself,
can you trust your landlord?

419
00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:37,608
Go ahead, you're not
going to get in my head.

420
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:40,149
I already am
in your head.

421
00:39:40,204 --> 00:39:41,842
They're going to
isolate you, Matt.

422
00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:43,249
They're going to be real
nice to you at first.

423
00:39:43,308 --> 00:39:46,050
They're going to put their arm
around you and tell you things like,

424
00:39:46,111 --> 00:39:49,115
"You did a decent job, son.
We'll take it from here. "

425
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:50,626
That's when you know
you're screwed.

426
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:53,689
Forget about me. They're
going to focus on you.

427
00:39:53,753 --> 00:39:55,994
They're going to try and make a
connection between you and I.

428
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:58,068
So that if this
all goes wrong,

429
00:39:58,124 --> 00:39:59,694
they'll have something
to fall back on

430
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:02,171
in their little
Senate hearings.

431
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,002
I'm not your
only enemy tonight.

432
00:40:10,572 --> 00:40:12,051
So, it's someone in-house.

433
00:40:12,107 --> 00:40:14,314
It's the only way this
thing could've happened.

434
00:40:14,376 --> 00:40:16,014
We were
completely buttoned up.

435
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:20,257
I want a list of everyone
who knew about this.

436
00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:21,818
Backgrounds, affiliations,

437
00:40:22,452 --> 00:40:24,523
particularly any
connections with Frost.

438
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:27,158
Every movement right
up until this operation.

439
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,867
Your extraction team, how
long had they been together?

440
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,774
My team had been together
six months. Why?

441
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:36,741
Well, I'm just trying to
get my head around this.

442
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,274
That will do, thank you.

443
00:42:27,691 --> 00:42:29,034
Hello.
Hey.

444
00:42:29,826 --> 00:42:31,169
Baby, where are you?

445
00:42:31,228 --> 00:42:33,139
I'm all right.
I'm okay.

446
00:42:34,198 --> 00:42:35,233
I'm okay.

447
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:39,774
I'm sorry I didn't call you
back, I saw your missed calls.

448
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:41,510
You must be worried sick.

449
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:42,846
Is everything okay?

450
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:46,656
I'm good.
I'm good. Listen.

451
00:42:46,712 --> 00:42:48,350
This sounds so crazy.

452
00:42:48,714 --> 00:42:50,853
We had some threats against
the clinic last night,

453
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:52,122
so Parker and I,
we stayed all night

454
00:42:52,184 --> 00:42:54,391
trying to get to
the bottom of it.

455
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:58,364
And I'm sorry that I didn't cal! you back.
I should have, right away.

456
00:42:58,424 --> 00:42:59,960
I was so worried.

457
00:43:00,226 --> 00:43:01,569
I know.

458
00:43:04,265 --> 00:43:07,474
Can you do me a favor? Can you go
over to the window for a second?

459
00:43:07,534 --> 00:43:08,638
Why?

460
00:43:09,036 --> 00:43:11,175
Can you just take a quick
look out the window?

461
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:13,310
I want you to see if
there's anyone out there.

462
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:15,446
Are there any cars
that don't belong?

463
00:43:15,543 --> 00:43:17,352
Anyone hanging
around out front?

464
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,723
There's a police car.

465
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:23,920
What's going on?

466
00:43:23,986 --> 00:43:25,021
I'm sorry about this.

467
00:43:25,087 --> 00:43:26,327
I know this is a lot,

468
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:27,993
but we felt like
it would be best

469
00:43:28,057 --> 00:43:29,593
if we didn't go home
as a precaution,

470
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,661
and I agree with him.

471
00:43:30,727 --> 00:43:32,468
I know there's nothing to worry
about, but I agree with him.

472
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,839
I think you should just go to
Dena's for a little while,

473
00:43:34,898 --> 00:43:37,742
just for a few hours, and I'll
call you in a little bit.

474
00:43:39,504 --> 00:43:41,177
And we'll
get together, okay?

475
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:50,285
Okay, I'll go.

476
00:43:54,486 --> 00:43:56,966
Okay. I love you. I'll talk
to you soon, all right?

477
00:43:57,023 --> 00:43:59,367
Don't worry. Okay, bye.

478
00:44:22,784 --> 00:44:24,491
She know what you do
for a living?

479
00:44:30,526 --> 00:44:33,996
The girl on the phone.
It was a girl, wasn't it?

480
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:38,175
Maybe it was a guy,
I don't know.

481
00:44:38,268 --> 00:44:39,474
I don't judge.

482
00:44:44,876 --> 00:44:48,517
You can't expect to have a real
relationship in our line of work, Matthew.

483
00:44:51,317 --> 00:44:52,455
Don't worry. She's not
going to leave you.

484
00:44:52,518 --> 00:44:56,398
See, what happens is, you try
to protect her with lies,

485
00:44:56,455 --> 00:44:58,025
and then it starts
to add up.

486
00:45:00,327 --> 00:45:02,364
At the safe house you said that
they'd kill me to get to you.

487
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,908
After awhile,
even the truth...

488
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:06,240
Why?... starts to
sound like a lie.

489
00:45:07,534 --> 00:45:09,741
You have something. You got something
that they want. What is it?

490
00:45:09,804 --> 00:45:10,805
Is she a local?

491
00:45:10,872 --> 00:45:11,907
Don't worry about her.
What is it?

492
00:45:11,973 --> 00:45:13,475
Oh, it is a girl.

493
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:29,927
You'll keep covering your
tracks, she'll keep believing.

494
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:33,099
Because she wants to,
because she needs to.

495
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:38,304
That's why we exist, you
and me, that's our job.

496
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:40,974
To take advantage of that.

497
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:45,179
People's desire
to believe.

498
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:47,084
To trust.

499
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:59,094
She's not going to
leave you, Matthew.

500
00:46:02,061 --> 00:46:03,802
You're going
to leave her.

501
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:11,942
I'm not you.

502
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:29,703
Correct, sir.
We verified it.

503
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,190
That is your boy.
You take it.

504
00:46:57,223 --> 00:46:58,463
Everybody, stand by.

505
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:01,130
Matty, it's me.

506
00:47:02,495 --> 00:47:03,496
How are you holding up?

507
00:47:04,898 --> 00:47:05,899
I'm all right.

508
00:47:10,137 --> 00:47:14,210
Matt, we can't get another
team in for at least 12 hours.

509
00:47:15,644 --> 00:47:16,714
Sorry.

510
00:47:17,979 --> 00:47:20,687
We've cleared a new safe house
for you outside the city.

511
00:47:21,016 --> 00:47:22,495
There's a Go-Bag located

512
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:27,296
at locker number 256, Green Point
Stadium Metrorail station.

513
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:31,403
The combination
is 2-5-1-22.

514
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,939
2-5-1-22.

515
00:47:32,995 --> 00:47:35,100
Now, the bag's
got a GPS in it.

516
00:47:35,165 --> 00:47:36,610
It'll direct you
to the safe house.

517
00:47:36,934 --> 00:47:39,778
But you got to be careful,
it's an active location.

518
00:47:39,836 --> 00:47:41,838
So, approach
with caution.

519
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:47,145
Matt?

520
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:52,354
Do you know how
they found Frost?

521
00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:53,795
Do you know who
led them to us?

522
00:47:56,855 --> 00:47:58,163
We're working on that.

523
00:47:59,091 --> 00:48:00,934
We're counting
on you, Matt.

524
00:48:01,294 --> 00:48:03,797
Get Frost to that safe house and
you can write your own ticket.

525
00:48:05,932 --> 00:48:07,206
I will.

526
00:48:09,837 --> 00:48:10,941
I will.

527
00:48:20,782 --> 00:48:21,920
Left at the light.

528
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:24,363
To the stadium?

529
00:48:24,419 --> 00:48:25,625
Yeah.

530
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:51,119
Hey, scarf.
How much for a scarf?

531
00:48:52,484 --> 00:48:53,792
Only fifty rand.

532
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:54,990
Thanks.

533
00:48:57,523 --> 00:48:58,558
Cuff your hands
together.

534
00:48:58,624 --> 00:48:59,728
Together?
Yeah.

535
00:49:09,703 --> 00:49:10,704
Out.

536
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:17,447
Are you sure you don't
want to just walk away from this?

537
00:49:17,512 --> 00:49:18,513
Can't do that.

538
00:49:18,579 --> 00:49:19,853
Yes, you can.
You should.

539
00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:26,493
Move. Go.
Across the street.

540
00:49:38,168 --> 00:49:42,173
Going to the game.
I like games.

541
00:49:42,406 --> 00:49:43,612
Metrorail,
straight ahead.

542
00:49:43,674 --> 00:49:44,675
Straight ahead.

543
00:49:54,753 --> 00:49:55,754
Right over there.

544
00:50:16,043 --> 00:50:17,044
Let's go.

545
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,911
Help! Help! He's
trying to kidnap me!

546
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:44,008
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

547
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:46,351
He's trying to
kidnap me! Help!

548
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:47,617
He's got a gun!

549
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:51,920
He's got a gun! He's
got a gun right there!

550
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:55,863
I'm undercover.
I'm undercover!

551
00:50:55,921 --> 00:50:58,094
Calm down, sir.
Everybody, calm down!

552
00:51:08,435 --> 00:51:09,937
Get down! Get down!

553
00:51:10,771 --> 00:51:13,411
All right! Okay!

554
00:51:30,326 --> 00:51:31,737
Get him up. Get up.

555
00:51:32,161 --> 00:51:33,299
Ow, ow, ow!

556
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:41,205
I'm an American citizen. I don't
know what he wanted from me.

557
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,378
Just calm down.

558
00:52:09,402 --> 00:52:12,008
Hey, hey, hey. I'm a police officer.
I'm from America.

559
00:52:12,072 --> 00:52:14,484
I arrested this man.
His name is Tobin Frost.

560
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:15,714
Where did you take him?

561
00:52:15,776 --> 00:52:17,653
He's in the infirmary.

562
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:24,858
There, there!
Is that it?

563
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,834
Top left, second screen from the top!
Look, look, the infirmary.

564
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,572
Right. Go back.

565
00:52:43,474 --> 00:52:45,613
Third-tier infirmary,
now! Move!

566
00:52:45,776 --> 00:52:47,653
Third-tier infirmary.
Go, now!

567
00:52:49,613 --> 00:52:50,614
Do you see?

568
00:53:23,464 --> 00:53:24,469
Don't move.

569
00:54:38,814 --> 00:54:39,853
Frost!

570
00:54:42,802 --> 00:54:43,807
Frost!

571
00:54:46,623 --> 00:54:47,662
Frost!

572
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:48,938
Hey!

573
00:54:50,512 --> 00:54:51,929
Stop! Stop!

574
00:54:54,198 --> 00:54:55,341
Get out the way!

575
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:56,680
Stop!

576
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,761
No! Stop!

577
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:22,617
Medic!

578
00:55:48,506 --> 00:55:49,677
Drop the gun.

579
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:51,578
Drop it.

580
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:53,485
I'm responsible for you.

581
00:55:57,181 --> 00:55:58,488
You're responsible
for yourself.

582
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:03,856
Get on your knees.

583
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:17,242
Are you going
to kill me?

584
00:56:29,442 --> 00:56:31,284
I only kill professionals.

585
00:56:50,828 --> 00:56:52,773
Height,
approximately six feet.

586
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:55,468
Anglo, wearing
a stadium security jacket.

587
00:56:55,532 --> 00:56:58,808
The suspect was last seen entering
Green Point Stadium Metrorail,

588
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:01,007
stadium concourse.

589
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:13,651
Sir, we have a thread on what Frost
might be doing in Cape Town.

590
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,183
Can you bring up...

591
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,195
Alec Wade.
Fifteen-year NOC at MI6.

592
00:57:21,255 --> 00:57:24,531
Sabotage, counter-ambush,
counter-IED tactics,

593
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:26,626
until he blew up an op
in Lisbon four years ago

594
00:57:26,692 --> 00:57:28,193
and was put on a desk,
pushing papers.

595
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:30,501
Cape Town Police found him
shot through the head,

596
00:57:30,563 --> 00:57:33,441
high-powered rifle, 14
blocks from the consulate.

597
00:57:33,498 --> 00:57:35,841
Witnesses placed someone
fitting Frost's description

598
00:57:35,901 --> 00:57:37,402
in the car at the time
of the shooting.

599
00:57:37,469 --> 00:57:39,880
And we think, what? That
they were working together?

600
00:57:39,937 --> 00:57:42,849
They ran joint operations
in Hamburg in the mid-'80s.

601
00:57:43,207 --> 00:57:46,050
Frost's last sighting
was in Hamburg, 2011.

602
00:57:46,944 --> 00:57:48,547
And what are the Brits
saying about Wade?

603
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:50,385
Officially,
they're saying nothing.

604
00:57:50,446 --> 00:57:51,480
Unofficially?

605
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:53,823
He's been the subject of a
five-month internal investigation.

606
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:55,589
They think he's
been trading intel.

607
00:57:55,652 --> 00:57:56,686
Hmm.

608
00:57:56,752 --> 00:57:58,890
So what the hell
did Wade leak to Frost

609
00:57:58,954 --> 00:58:02,127
that was so important it was
worth killing six of our men?

610
00:58:04,892 --> 00:58:09,237
I want more details from MI6.
Call in every chit you got.

611
00:58:09,297 --> 00:58:10,331
Yes, sir.

612
00:58:10,398 --> 00:58:12,741
David, I want
an internal investigation

613
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,506
into Daniel Kiefer
and his team.

614
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,679
I've got Weston calling in
for David Barlow.

615
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:06,986
WESTON ON PHONE

616
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:08,457
Frost?

617
00:59:08,515 --> 00:59:09,788
Yeah, he's gone.

618
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:12,351
After I picked up the GPS,
he created a diversion,

619
00:59:12,418 --> 00:59:14,124
took out a couple of cops
at the stadium.

620
00:59:14,187 --> 00:59:15,563
Any idea
where he's headed?

621
00:59:15,622 --> 00:59:17,032
Not exactly,
but I will.

622
00:59:17,089 --> 00:59:19,466
This is Linklater. You
said he took out two cops?

623
00:59:19,524 --> 00:59:21,230
Matt, you're on speaker.

624
00:59:22,794 --> 00:59:25,706
Yes, ma'am.
At the Green Point Stadium.

625
00:59:25,763 --> 00:59:28,140
...involvement
in a possible kidnapping.

626
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:31,179
The suspect is being described
as a white male of medium build.

627
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,544
Stadium police is
reporting you shot a cop.

628
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,673
I returned fire
in self-defense.

629
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,674
The fact of the matter is,
Frost is on the loose.

630
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,820
I've spent the last
14 hours with him.

631
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:43,220
He might have said or done something
that could lead me to him.

632
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:46,953
You are to stand down,
proceed to the consulate,

633
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,325
and present yourself for exfil and debrief.
Acknowledge.

634
00:59:49,518 --> 00:59:51,861
By the time I'm debriefed,
Frost will be gone.

635
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,421
I've spent 12
months researching

636
00:59:53,488 --> 00:59:54,693
every square inch
of this town.

637
00:59:54,756 --> 00:59:57,463
I will find Frost
and I'll deliver him.

638
00:59:57,525 --> 00:59:59,970
Weston, this is
Harlan Whitford, son.

639
01:00:02,963 --> 01:00:06,569
Now, you've done a fine job,
but we'll take it from here.

640
01:00:12,238 --> 01:00:13,545
Understood.

641
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,693
Hello.

642
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:37,168
Sir, I respectfully
request that,

643
01:00:37,226 --> 01:00:38,602
that exchange not
make it onto his files.

644
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,137
He's either incompetent or he's
working with somebody else.

645
01:00:41,196 --> 01:00:42,697
Do not make this
about Weston.

646
01:00:42,864 --> 01:00:44,274
It was your guys
that lost Frost.

647
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:46,039
It was your team that
folded at the safe house.

648
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:49,240
I want both of you on an
airplane to Cape Town.

649
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:53,945
Frost is trying to get out of the country.
Go find his ass.

650
01:01:26,103 --> 01:01:27,809
There you go, baby.

651
01:01:34,243 --> 01:01:35,653
One ticket to Jo'burg.

652
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:45,918
Thank you.

653
01:02:20,984 --> 01:02:24,692
Police had detained
American NGO worker Matthew Weston

654
01:02:24,753 --> 01:02:27,494
as a possible suspect
in the shooting.

655
01:02:27,656 --> 01:02:30,226
Weston had been
detained earlier today,

656
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:34,899
but managed to escape while being
questioned by stadium security officials

657
01:02:34,996 --> 01:02:37,566
about his involvement
in the shootings.

658
01:02:37,765 --> 01:02:41,234
The suspect has been described
as a white male of medium build,

659
01:02:41,301 --> 01:02:44,509
possibly wearing
a stadium security outfit.

660
01:02:49,241 --> 01:02:50,446
Baby

661
01:02:52,845 --> 01:02:54,255
Are you all right?

662
01:03:11,929 --> 01:03:13,430
I lied to you.

663
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,338
About everything.
The NGO, Parker.

664
01:03:20,603 --> 01:03:21,603
My job.

665
01:03:23,171 --> 01:03:24,308
My family.

666
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:29,310
So, who do you work for?

667
01:03:34,682 --> 01:03:35,887
The government.

668
01:03:38,718 --> 01:03:39,718
CIA.

669
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:41,497
No, I don't...

670
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:43,489
I don't do anything.

671
01:03:43,656 --> 01:03:47,660
I sit around in an apartment
all day I answer the phone.

672
01:04:00,638 --> 01:04:02,708
I need you to leave.

673
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:06,419
I need you to do that
for me. Okay?

674
01:04:12,414 --> 01:04:13,448
Here.

675
01:04:15,584 --> 01:04:17,187
This is a ticket
to Jo'burg.

676
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:19,561
When you get there, you go
straight to the airport.

677
01:04:19,621 --> 01:04:21,258
There's a 6:00 a.m. flight
to Paris.

678
01:04:22,056 --> 01:04:23,125
Take this.

679
01:04:23,758 --> 01:04:25,293
You take this.
If anyone stops you...

680
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:28,238
If anyone stops you...
If anybody stops you...

681
01:04:28,295 --> 01:04:29,864
Who do you think I am?

682
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:31,067
Stop, Stop

683
01:04:31,131 --> 01:04:32,165
Fuck you!

684
01:04:32,232 --> 01:04:34,973
Hey, stop. Stop it.

685
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:46,019
We broke up a week ago. You
haven't seen me since, okay?

686
01:04:52,716 --> 01:04:53,921
I'm sorry.

687
01:05:00,456 --> 01:05:03,595
Just leave. Please?

688
01:05:07,629 --> 01:05:08,766
Do you love me?

689
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:10,069
Very much.

690
01:05:11,233 --> 01:05:13,178
Go. Go.

691
01:05:19,807 --> 01:05:20,910
Go.

692
01:05:44,462 --> 01:05:46,771
Attention, all passengers,

693
01:05:46,831 --> 01:05:49,436
Platform 20
for Langa Township

694
01:05:49,499 --> 01:05:51,500
departing in five minutes.

695
01:05:53,637 --> 01:05:56,640
Langa Township,
departing in five minutes.

696
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:24,101
Sir. Someone just logged into our
system using Weston's password

697
01:06:24,163 --> 01:06:26,335
accessing his
stored files.

698
01:06:27,699 --> 01:06:30,201
It's him. What
the hell is he doing?

699
01:06:31,003 --> 01:06:32,242
I'm not sure.

700
01:06:32,304 --> 01:06:33,543
I want to see
what he's looking at.

701
01:06:37,742 --> 01:06:38,913
He's pulled an old report

702
01:06:38,976 --> 01:06:42,320
on surveillance targets living
in the Langa Township area.

703
01:06:44,581 --> 01:06:48,221
It's a profile of Carlos
Villar, a Nicaraguan national.

704
01:06:48,351 --> 01:06:50,523
He's a known
document forger.

705
01:06:50,587 --> 01:06:52,463
Get me a copy
of Weston's report.

706
01:06:52,521 --> 01:06:53,590
Yes, sir.

707
01:06:54,323 --> 01:06:55,426
Logged off, sir.
He's gone.

708
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:57,665
An Internet cafe
on Long Street.

709
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,626
Like a black
Dorian Gray.

710
01:07:26,685 --> 01:07:28,789
That's right.
How you doing, brother?

711
01:07:30,021 --> 01:07:31,465
Come in.
Yes, sir.

712
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,960
Illana?

713
01:07:38,729 --> 01:07:39,763
Hi.

714
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:41,331
We have a guest.

715
01:07:43,132 --> 01:07:44,667
illana.
Good to meet you.

716
01:07:44,734 --> 01:07:46,337
Joseph, my daughter.

717
01:07:46,836 --> 01:07:48,746
How are you?
Hello.

718
01:07:48,804 --> 01:07:49,804
My son-in-law.

719
01:07:52,674 --> 01:07:54,209
May I offer you some tea?

720
01:07:54,743 --> 01:07:56,483
No, we're going
upstairs.

721
01:08:09,122 --> 01:08:10,600
I remembered.

722
01:08:12,692 --> 01:08:14,170
You even let it breathe.

723
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:22,839
"Too long a sacrifice Can
make a stone of the heart

724
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:28,176
"O when may it suffice?

725
01:08:29,207 --> 01:08:31,482
"That is Heaven's part"

726
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,120
In the old days,
a cheap bottle

727
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,216
of Flor de Cana kept us
happy all night.

728
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:42,792
Mmm. Tastes change.

729
01:08:46,855 --> 01:08:48,356
People change.

730
01:08:53,495 --> 01:08:55,440
People don't change.

731
01:08:56,697 --> 01:08:58,471
We grow old.

732
01:08:58,532 --> 01:09:00,943
And some of us adapt.

733
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:04,804
And learn how to enjoy
simple pleasures of life,

734
01:09:05,872 --> 01:09:09,045
like a family, a home.

735
01:09:09,776 --> 01:09:11,448
And for you...

736
01:09:11,977 --> 01:09:14,252
What's in that glass
right now, for you,

737
01:09:14,312 --> 01:09:16,723
is as good as it's
ever going to be.

738
01:09:19,316 --> 01:09:22,421
One day you'll understand.

739
01:09:22,486 --> 01:09:26,058
You got more past
than future, you learn.

740
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:29,792
What is this?
An intervention?

741
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:37,610
I thought you were dead.

742
01:09:52,145 --> 01:09:54,624
So, what brings you to my home
in the middle of the night

743
01:09:54,681 --> 01:09:56,159
after all these years?

744
01:10:10,762 --> 01:10:11,933
Ooh.

745
01:10:18,035 --> 01:10:19,069
Papa?

746
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:20,604
Uh-huh.

747
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,081
We're going.

748
01:10:22,539 --> 01:10:23,676
Okay, be careful.

749
01:10:23,739 --> 01:10:25,240
Okay, Papa

750
01:10:44,992 --> 01:10:46,800
What are you
going to do with this?

751
01:10:47,694 --> 01:10:49,673
Make some money.

752
01:10:49,929 --> 01:10:51,032
Let me borrow
your glasses.

753
01:10:58,537 --> 01:10:59,844
That's it. Listen.

754
01:10:59,905 --> 01:11:04,444
I'm going to need a new passport,
photo ID, driver's license,

755
01:11:04,509 --> 01:11:07,045
the whole shebang.
Can you do that for me?

756
01:11:08,212 --> 01:11:09,315
Yeah.

757
01:11:11,349 --> 01:11:12,383
You sure?

758
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:14,652
Yes.

759
01:11:21,957 --> 01:11:23,993
Weston never
showed at the consulate.

760
01:11:24,059 --> 01:11:26,504
And he was just
accessing our secure server,

761
01:11:26,562 --> 01:11:29,371
searching for someone
to create an alias package.

762
01:11:31,132 --> 01:11:33,907
He's trying to
leave the country.

763
01:11:34,269 --> 01:11:36,111
Or he's going
after Frost.

764
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:39,447
Look at what
happened at the soccer stadium.

765
01:11:39,973 --> 01:11:42,009
This guy
let Frost escape.

766
01:11:45,244 --> 01:11:47,223
I think Weston's turned.

767
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,883
I know this boy.

768
01:11:49,549 --> 01:11:52,495
He's been looking for a
chance to prove himself.

769
01:11:52,551 --> 01:11:54,791
He's trying to
bring in Frost.

770
01:11:56,588 --> 01:11:57,930
Come on, David.

771
01:11:58,023 --> 01:12:00,093
You're not
seeing the evidence.

772
01:12:11,901 --> 01:12:13,504
Not my best work.

773
01:12:13,703 --> 01:12:17,013
But given the pressure
of time, it's passable.

774
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:19,181
It's good.
I'll wire you the money

775
01:12:19,241 --> 01:12:20,685
as soon as
I get out of town.

776
01:12:20,742 --> 01:12:25,315
Tobin, don't do this.
It's different.

777
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,789
You don't need the trouble,
you don't need the money.

778
01:12:28,983 --> 01:12:30,723
You can give it...

779
01:12:50,835 --> 01:12:51,835
Carlos!

780
01:12:51,903 --> 01:12:53,313
Illana!

781
01:12:53,538 --> 01:12:54,641
Carlos!

782
01:12:54,739 --> 01:12:55,842
illana!

783
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:01,144
Carlos.

784
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,249
Carlos!

785
01:13:13,588 --> 01:13:14,725
Go.

786
01:13:15,523 --> 01:13:16,694
Go.

787
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:30,570
He's on the roof!

788
01:14:31,157 --> 01:14:32,157
Go! Go!

789
01:15:58,166 --> 01:15:59,667
Get in the car!

790
01:16:29,426 --> 01:16:31,905
They think they can
come at me like this.

791
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,804
Have to do it a whole
lot better than that.

792
01:16:39,736 --> 01:16:40,770
Shit!

793
01:16:54,315 --> 01:16:55,850
Matt, how'd you find me?

794
01:16:56,517 --> 01:16:57,961
It wasn't that hard.

795
01:17:15,267 --> 01:17:16,574
Let's go.

796
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,030
Wait, wait, wait.

797
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:00,114
Who do you work for?

798
01:20:19,195 --> 01:20:20,195
Who sent you?

799
01:20:22,098 --> 01:20:24,839
Who sent you?
Who sent you?

800
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:27,468
Who?

801
01:20:28,103 --> 01:20:29,172
Vargas.

802
01:20:29,437 --> 01:20:30,437
Vargas.

803
01:20:30,839 --> 01:20:31,942
Who's Vargas?

804
01:20:32,339 --> 01:20:33,544
Who's Vargas?

805
01:20:37,311 --> 01:20:38,846
You want to die?

806
01:20:42,949 --> 01:20:44,393
Who's Vargas?

807
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:49,859
Matt.

808
01:20:57,028 --> 01:20:58,802
CIA.

809
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:04,143
CIA! CIA!

810
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:34,729
Report?

811
01:21:34,795 --> 01:21:36,603
There was a shootout
in the Langa Township.

812
01:21:37,229 --> 01:21:40,266
Two crime scenes. One at the
residence of Carlos Villar.

813
01:21:40,332 --> 01:21:41,867
He's a document forger.

814
01:21:41,934 --> 01:21:43,571
The other in
a nearby tenement.

815
01:21:43,636 --> 01:21:44,773
And where was
Frost last seen?

816
01:21:44,837 --> 01:21:45,940
Tenement.

817
01:21:46,838 --> 01:21:47,975
Have fun at Villar's.

818
01:21:48,039 --> 01:21:49,642
We'll meet up later.

819
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:11,859
You were right
about Ana.

820
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:15,565
That's her name.

821
01:22:18,132 --> 01:22:19,542
Sorry to hear that.

822
01:22:21,869 --> 01:22:26,544
Most case officers get
married three, four times.

823
01:22:28,675 --> 01:22:30,347
You?

824
01:22:33,046 --> 01:22:34,649
Once.

825
01:22:46,757 --> 01:22:48,861
You're falling apart
over here.

826
01:22:56,666 --> 01:22:59,373
Don't kill innocent people,
Matthew.

827
01:23:02,071 --> 01:23:03,276
What?

828
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:13,790
Air traffic controller,
a tiny airstrip in Bermuda.

829
01:23:13,848 --> 01:23:17,385
George Edwart Cox,
I remember that name.

830
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:19,327
Edwart, with a

831
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:25,232
My inside officer said he was
organizing arms shipments,

832
01:23:25,291 --> 01:23:29,102
but he was just an air traffic controller.
He was just a guy.

833
01:23:29,695 --> 01:23:31,833
I put a bullet
in his skull.

834
01:23:35,033 --> 01:23:38,275
Black Ops came in, they replaced
him with one of their own,

835
01:23:38,436 --> 01:23:40,676
and crashed a Gulf stream
in the ocean that night.

836
01:23:40,738 --> 01:23:44,446
The thing was, the family
that was on the plane...

837
01:23:45,576 --> 01:23:48,954
The husband,
he was a whistleblower.

838
01:23:50,113 --> 01:23:52,820
The whole thing was about

839
01:23:52,882 --> 01:23:56,454
stopping him from
testifying about wet works

840
01:23:57,586 --> 01:23:59,690
to a congressional hearing.

841
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:04,563
Is that why you left?

842
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:05,796
No.

843
01:24:07,795 --> 01:24:11,537
I went back to work the next day
like nothing ever happened.

844
01:24:14,501 --> 01:24:17,709
You practice anything a long
time, you get good at it.

845
01:24:17,771 --> 01:24:21,343
You tell a hundred lies a day,
it sounds like the truth.

846
01:24:21,407 --> 01:24:23,784
Everyone betrays everyone.

847
01:24:26,512 --> 01:24:28,855
That's a shitty excuse.

848
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:33,590
Yeah, I used to be
innocent like you.

849
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:36,426
Wrap myself up
in the flag...

850
01:24:43,826 --> 01:24:45,805
I'm going to take you in.

851
01:24:54,402 --> 01:24:55,971
Good for you.

852
01:25:50,184 --> 01:25:51,287
Barlow.

853
01:25:51,352 --> 01:25:53,228
LINKLATER ON PHONE Witnesses
identified a pair of men

854
01:25:53,288 --> 01:25:55,130
fitting Weston and
Frost's description

855
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:57,225
leaving this
location together.

856
01:25:57,391 --> 01:25:58,630
So, he pulled it off.

857
01:25:58,692 --> 01:26:01,570
Weston is aiding and
abetting a fugitive.

858
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:03,066
You're wrong.

859
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:05,735
If he's with Frost, he's
taking him to the safe house.

860
01:26:05,798 --> 01:26:07,606
That's where we got to be.

861
01:26:08,067 --> 01:26:09,636
Fine. Fine.

862
01:26:09,802 --> 01:26:12,543
Meet me at the crossroads
at Old Malmesbury Road.

863
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:40,970
Who are you?

864
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:43,103
You Weston?

865
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:46,369
Give me the shotgun.

866
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:48,037
What the hell is this?

867
01:26:48,102 --> 01:26:49,171
Who are you?

868
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:51,979
I'm Keller.
Safe house keeper.

869
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:55,745
Authorization Index, Bravo
Four Seven Oscar Whiskey Six.

870
01:26:56,343 --> 01:26:58,754
Inside. Let's go.

871
01:27:08,253 --> 01:27:10,095
To the left.

872
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:13,963
Slowly.

873
01:27:14,659 --> 01:27:16,695
I don't know who trained you,
man, but this sure as hell

874
01:27:16,761 --> 01:27:18,501
ain't protocol.
Where's the guest room?

875
01:27:19,429 --> 01:27:21,601
That's the thing, we
don't really have one.

876
01:27:22,632 --> 01:27:25,544
In there. In there.

877
01:27:29,472 --> 01:27:32,247
Cuff him.
To the pipe.

878
01:27:39,848 --> 01:27:41,053
Out. Over there.

879
01:27:41,516 --> 01:27:42,994
All right.

880
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:46,621
Control room.

881
01:27:48,222 --> 01:27:50,792
Whatever you say, man
It's your rodeo.

882
01:28:02,134 --> 01:28:03,669
Call it in.
Let me hear it.

883
01:28:13,744 --> 01:28:14,915
Landlord.

884
01:28:14,978 --> 01:28:17,014
My guest is here.

885
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:18,149
Account?

886
01:28:18,214 --> 01:28:19,419
Abaresque Limited.

887
01:28:21,151 --> 01:28:22,185
With a guest?

888
01:28:22,252 --> 01:28:23,423
Yeah, package delivered.

889
01:28:25,187 --> 01:28:28,258
Confirmed.
Pickup scheduled.

890
01:28:28,857 --> 01:28:30,563
They're on the way.

891
01:28:33,194 --> 01:28:35,503
Can we at least
put the gun down now?

892
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:46,372
Thanks, Clayton. Bye.

893
01:28:48,207 --> 01:28:50,015
It's a microchip.

894
01:28:50,576 --> 01:28:51,849
What?

895
01:28:52,545 --> 01:28:53,989
That was
my guy from MI6.

896
01:28:54,046 --> 01:28:55,490
Wade got his hands
on a microchip.

897
01:28:55,647 --> 01:28:56,852
And what was on it?

898
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:58,154
Only Wade knew,

899
01:28:58,216 --> 01:28:59,592
but I think
it's safe to assume

900
01:28:59,651 --> 01:29:00,788
that's why he
hooked up with Frost.

901
01:29:00,852 --> 01:29:02,330
To sell it.

902
01:29:03,954 --> 01:29:04,988
Let's get moving.

903
01:29:38,051 --> 01:29:39,552
Long day, huh?

904
01:29:45,491 --> 01:29:48,266
I can only imagine.
Tobin Frost.

905
01:29:49,728 --> 01:29:51,502
That man's a legend.

906
01:29:52,331 --> 01:29:53,809
I hope you
picked up something.

907
01:29:53,865 --> 01:29:56,174
You ain't going to
find a better education.

908
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:08,422
This is the most
excitement I've seen.

909
01:30:08,478 --> 01:30:10,980
You're the first guest
I've had in 10 months.

910
01:30:11,647 --> 01:30:14,058
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, right?

911
01:30:14,116 --> 01:30:15,890
You got a city posting.

912
01:30:16,552 --> 01:30:19,998
Yeah, nightlife, beaches.

913
01:30:20,054 --> 01:30:22,761
Little ladies
running around everywhere.

914
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:26,300
Yeah.

915
01:30:28,262 --> 01:30:30,104
I'm jealous.

916
01:30:36,402 --> 01:30:37,744
You got coffee?

917
01:30:37,803 --> 01:30:39,475
Yeah, it's in the cupboard.

918
01:30:39,539 --> 01:30:40,608
Where?

919
01:30:40,673 --> 01:30:42,652
Want me to get it?
I got it.

920
01:34:02,016 --> 01:34:04,222
Why are you
in Cape Town?

921
01:34:07,187 --> 01:34:09,826
Tell me now. Why?

922
01:34:16,361 --> 01:34:18,306
What is it?

923
01:34:18,363 --> 01:34:21,605
A dirt list,
laundry list.

924
01:34:21,666 --> 01:34:25,841
Israeli Intelligence, five years
ago, compiled blackmail intel.

925
01:34:26,771 --> 01:34:30,843
Corrupt agents,
German Intelligence, MI6...

926
01:34:30,907 --> 01:34:31,976
CIA?

927
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:33,747
Yes.

928
01:34:34,945 --> 01:34:36,582
We got to get away.

929
01:34:37,913 --> 01:34:40,358
We got to get out of here.

930
01:34:49,124 --> 01:34:50,158
Ah, shit.

931
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:08,914
Don't, don't, don't.

932
01:35:15,147 --> 01:35:18,218
No, don't leave me here,
please.

933
01:35:18,315 --> 01:35:19,918
Don't do it.

934
01:36:05,057 --> 01:36:06,126
Matt?

935
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,433
Hey.

936
01:36:13,231 --> 01:36:14,732
How you doing?

937
01:36:21,171 --> 01:36:22,581
I'm proud of you.

938
01:36:25,675 --> 01:36:27,654
And what you pulled off.

939
01:36:30,146 --> 01:36:33,490
You're going to make
a hell of a case officer.

940
01:36:35,483 --> 01:36:37,291
Where's Frost?

941
01:36:37,619 --> 01:36:38,995
He's gone.

942
01:36:41,622 --> 01:36:46,161
Place is a wreck.
Blood everywhere.

943
01:36:47,026 --> 01:36:48,629
Was he injured or...

944
01:36:52,699 --> 01:36:55,474
I guess you know
he killed Keller.

945
01:36:56,468 --> 01:36:57,605
No.

946
01:36:59,771 --> 01:37:01,374
I killed Keller.

947
01:37:09,847 --> 01:37:12,122
Frost killed Keller.

948
01:37:14,150 --> 01:37:16,493
He killed Linklater, too.

949
01:37:19,822 --> 01:37:23,530
Did he talk about anything?
Anything he was after?

950
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,604
Anything he might
have had?

951
01:37:28,029 --> 01:37:29,302
The file.

952
01:37:30,198 --> 01:37:31,574
The file?

953
01:37:33,368 --> 01:37:35,210
The file that you're on.

954
01:37:40,574 --> 01:37:42,314
Along with a lot
of other people.

955
01:37:42,476 --> 01:37:44,113
Important people.

956
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:57,488
Listen to me.

957
01:37:58,423 --> 01:38:00,698
What would you do

958
01:38:00,758 --> 01:38:03,397
if someone is
watching your every move?

959
01:38:04,695 --> 01:38:07,470
Some maybe
you're not proud of.

960
01:38:07,531 --> 01:38:11,000
And you will have some you're
not proud of, believe me.

961
01:38:11,067 --> 01:38:13,603
And then tries to
use it against you?

962
01:38:16,204 --> 01:38:18,376
You would do
what you have to do.

963
01:38:19,241 --> 01:38:21,652
You would do
what you have to do.

964
01:38:28,582 --> 01:38:30,254
Where's the file?

965
01:38:37,991 --> 01:38:41,096
Matt, the file.
Where is the file?

966
01:38:43,762 --> 01:38:45,138
You're a dead man.

967
01:38:45,998 --> 01:38:47,476
Yeah, a long time now.

968
01:38:47,733 --> 01:38:49,405
Frost is here.

969
01:40:52,175 --> 01:40:53,517
Let's go.

970
01:41:16,429 --> 01:41:18,032
We got him.

971
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:21,471
A hell of a job.

972
01:41:56,965 --> 01:41:58,375
You smell that?

973
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:01,641
Pinotage. It's a good grape.
Great wine.

974
01:42:01,703 --> 01:42:05,741
Local grape.
Pinotage is great...

975
01:42:13,412 --> 01:42:15,823
I don't want you
losing this one.

976
01:42:16,382 --> 01:42:19,294
It's worth a lot
of money.

977
01:42:22,587 --> 01:42:25,066
You're a good boy,
Matty.

978
01:42:27,425 --> 01:42:29,097
You know what you are.

979
01:42:32,463 --> 01:42:33,805
Hey.

980
01:42:34,798 --> 01:42:36,708
I know what you're not.

981
01:42:40,904 --> 01:42:43,076
You're better than me.

982
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:51,619
No, it's okay,
just be better than me.

983
01:42:56,317 --> 01:42:58,057
You promise me.

984
01:42:59,487 --> 01:43:00,760
Yeah.

985
01:43:06,359 --> 01:43:08,668
Well, let's...

986
01:43:10,996 --> 01:43:12,702
Let's go.

987
01:43:14,099 --> 01:43:17,602
I just got to get up.
I need to get up.

988
01:43:19,837 --> 01:43:20,906
Stay.

989
01:43:23,675 --> 01:43:24,846
Stay.

990
01:43:27,945 --> 01:43:29,184
Hey...

991
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:49,083
That's exactly
as it happened.

992
01:44:53,754 --> 01:44:55,494
Obviously,
this situation needs

993
01:44:55,554 --> 01:44:57,794
to be handled with a
certain amount of finesse.

994
01:44:58,291 --> 01:44:59,963
Has anybody else
seen this report?

995
01:45:00,026 --> 01:45:01,936
No, sir. Not yet.

996
01:45:03,261 --> 01:45:04,898
Matt, I'm sure this
comes as no surprise,

997
01:45:04,963 --> 01:45:09,638
but parts of this report are going to
have to be altered for national security.

998
01:45:10,968 --> 01:45:12,412
Which parts, sir?

999
01:45:12,469 --> 01:45:13,879
Well...

1000
01:45:14,471 --> 01:45:16,541
David Barlow can't
be held responsible

1001
01:45:16,607 --> 01:45:18,483
for what happened
to the safe house.

1002
01:45:19,309 --> 01:45:21,914
We just don't
need the scandal.

1003
01:45:21,978 --> 01:45:24,480
But, sir, you and I both know
that, that is just not the truth.

1004
01:45:24,547 --> 01:45:27,152
People don't want
the truth anymore, Matt.

1005
01:45:27,215 --> 01:45:30,127
It's too messy.
Keeps them up nights.

1006
01:45:34,356 --> 01:45:36,665
I'll tell you what I am
willing to do, though.

1007
01:45:37,491 --> 01:45:40,596
I think the Agency has
grossly underestimated you,

1008
01:45:40,661 --> 01:45:44,802
and I'm recommending you for a
senior case officer position.

1009
01:45:44,864 --> 01:45:46,365
Provided you still want it.

1010
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:49,939
That's a generous
offer, sir.

1011
01:45:51,036 --> 01:45:54,778
There's just one thing you
need to clarify for me.

1012
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,147
Of course.

1013
01:45:57,209 --> 01:46:00,246
Frost may have been
carrying some vital intel.

1014
01:46:00,311 --> 01:46:01,653
A file.

1015
01:46:02,213 --> 01:46:05,091
I'm not seeing that
anywhere in this report.

1016
01:46:12,522 --> 01:46:14,330
What was
on the file, sir?

1017
01:46:14,391 --> 01:46:17,132
Something that, quite frankly,
could be very damaging

1018
01:46:17,193 --> 01:46:19,536
to the Agency
and to our allies.

1019
01:46:22,698 --> 01:46:26,839
I don't see why Frost would even
mention something like that to me.

1020
01:46:32,072 --> 01:46:34,517
No, I suppose he wouldn't,
would he?

1021
01:46:38,879 --> 01:46:42,155
You realize, though,
that if that file did leak,

1022
01:46:43,683 --> 01:46:45,821
what would happen
to the person responsible?

1023
01:46:45,885 --> 01:46:47,886
That person would
be arrested, sir.

1024
01:46:47,953 --> 01:46:49,795
He'd be risking
everything.

1025
01:46:50,822 --> 01:46:54,633
He'd have enemies in every
intelligence agency in the world.

1026
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:59,832
In the eyes of the CIA he'd
be just like Tobin Frost.

1027
01:47:03,634 --> 01:47:06,580
Frost didn't say anything
about a file, sir.

1028
01:47:11,808 --> 01:47:13,150
All right, son.

1029
01:47:14,276 --> 01:47:15,879
Take a few days off.

1030
01:47:15,944 --> 01:47:17,923
We'll get you
started next week.

1031
01:47:19,748 --> 01:47:21,090
Thank you.

1032
01:47:23,284 --> 01:47:26,264
And think about our
conversation, would you?

1033
01:47:26,521 --> 01:47:28,022
Will do.

1034
01:47:28,089 --> 01:47:30,066
I'll take it
from here, sir.

1035
01:47:55,610 --> 01:47:56,882
...and other media outlets

1036
01:47:56,943 --> 01:47:59,782
received a controversial file
from an anonymous source.

1037
01:47:59,975 --> 01:48:01,747
The international intelligence
community is still reeling

1038
01:48:01,808 --> 01:48:04,841
from the release of so many
highly classified documents

1039
01:48:04,906 --> 01:48:08,405
and the revelations of widespread
corruption and criminal activity

1040
01:48:08,471 --> 01:48:09,504
at the CIA,
the BND, and MI6.

1041
01:48:09,571 --> 01:48:10,707
...is in
an uproar over the lack

1042
01:48:10,771 --> 01:48:12,679
of oversight given to
British Intelligence,

1043
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:15,076
demanding accountability
of the rogue agents.

1044
01:48:15,136 --> 01:48:16,942
Officials at MI6
are fully cooperating.

1045
01:48:17,001 --> 01:48:18,534
Chancellor
Merkel insists that the BND

1046
01:48:18,601 --> 01:48:20,475
has already identified
the corrupt agents

1047
01:48:20,533 --> 01:48:22,339
and contained
the intelligence breach.

1048
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,001
She has ensured her
international counterparts...

1049
01:48:24,065 --> 01:48:26,099
Indictments are
now expected within the week,

1050
01:48:26,164 --> 01:48:28,697
and Congress has demanded that
Deputy Director Harlan Whitford

1051
01:48:28,763 --> 01:48:30,706
testify before
a Senate subcommittee

1052
01:48:30,763 --> 01:48:32,467
in an effort to
determine how many people

1053
01:48:32,528 --> 01:48:34,334
at the CIA are
involved in this

1054
01:48:34,395 --> 01:48:38,132
and just how far up
the corruption reaches.
