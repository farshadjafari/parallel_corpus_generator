1
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,756
Did you feel that too?

2
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:36,565
-What?
-Your stomach.

3
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:37,716
lt's like butterflies.

4
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:41,118
My mom said when l met
the right girl, l'd feel butterflies.

5
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:42,276
l think l'm ready.

6
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:46,356
Can you believe him?

7
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:48,199
He falls so easily.

8
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:49,720
l'm a little more guarded.

9
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:53,482
l guess it's because
l've been hurt before.

10
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:55,961
I'll never hurt you.

11
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,680
-My dad.
-My dad.

12
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:05,443
-You guys are sisters?
-Our dads are friends.

13
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,484
They went to the gym.
They're muscle-heads.

14
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:10,525
Your best bet is to curl into a ball
until they stop beating you.

15
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:13,724
l'm telling you this
because l think l might love you.

16
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:20,356
What's our play?

17
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:23,564
Run for the window. I'll get
the car keys. Y formation, dog-leg left.

18
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:25,479
-Ready, break.
-Break.

19
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:47,636
We should wait
two days before we call them.

20
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:52,763
You've gotta be kidding me.

21
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:56,317
Do you think they have any concept
of how fast a car can go?

22
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:07,844
Reverse kitty cat, dog-leg left,
over the fence, on my count, break.

23
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:34,397
-Hey, l'm Nick.
-Shawn. Can we use your pool?

24
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:47,963
Come on, Tigers. Yeah!

25
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,436
Split Johnny left!
Split Johnny left!

26
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:54,521
Come on! Come on, guys!
Set. Hike.

27
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:09,083
Yeah! Yeah! All day. All day.
Candy from a baby.

28
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:12,117
-What do you wanna do?
-That brunette.

29
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:14,960
Looks like she wouldn't mind
St. Nick stuffed down her chimney.

30
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:16,560
No, l mean, the play, in the game.

31
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:19,161
-Come on, guys, focus.
-l've never been more focused.

32
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,522
Check it, couple of meatloaves
in that baby tee.

33
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,200
Not mad at that belly ring either.

34
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:26,518
Have you seen this blond?
Rackety-rack, don't talk back.

35
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:28,279
Wonder if her carpet
matches my drapes.

36
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:30,244
Delay of game, loss of five yards.

37
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:32,557
And just because
it's a spring scrimmage...

38
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:35,161
...doesn't mean you can
shit yourselves out here. Go!

39
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:37,961
-Sorry, coach.
-Go, go, go. Come on, go, go.

40
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:39,964
Tigers!

41
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:42,004
<i>Come on, crowd</i>
<i>Let's hear some noise</i>

42
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,283
<i>N-O-I-S-E</i>
<i>Noise</i>

43
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:46,039
God. See, look, we took too long.

44
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:48,277
Here come
the whack-ass cheerleaders, man.

45
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:51,723
<i>Noise, N-O-I-S-E</i>
<i>Noise</i>

46
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:52,922
Tigers.

47
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:03,647
-Well, l am pumped up.
-All right, what's the play?

48
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:05,877
Hold on,
baby tee is signing me her number.

49
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:09,562
-ls that a seven? A five and a two?
-Any day now, shit buckets.

50
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:12,525
l don't wanna run laps all afternoon.
l have a shrink appointment.

51
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:15,247
Dude, your cousin stuck his finger
in your ass. Get over it.

52
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:19,644
They playing us loose. Let's
get short passes and extra yardage.

53
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:22,401
The hell with that, man.
You either bet big or go home.

54
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:25,680
-You gotta risk it to get the biscuit.
-Aye, my brother.

55
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:29,556
All right. Pro-zoom trips, deep route,
slant slim boogie on my count. Ready?

56
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,160
Break.

57
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:33,405
54s and Mike, watch that blitz.

58
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:36,717
Blue 1 7, set, hut.

59
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,516
Come on, Shawn.

60
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:48,360
Come on, baby. Yeah!

61
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:03,883
-Hey, l'm Nick.
-Shawn.

62
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:11,802
-Hey, Shawn.
-Hey, Maddy.

63
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,959
Thanks for helping me study Bio.
l'm retarded about reverse osmosis.

64
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:16,116
No, you're not.

65
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:18,676
Pressure forcing a solvent
through a membrane...

66
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:21,645
...like when a water balloon
gets too big and then explodes.

67
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:25,277
Got it. Thanks. You're so awesome.

68
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:27,039
No. Science is awesome.

69
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:30,162
And you're awesome.
Now, go crush that test.

70
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:32,204
-Thanks.
-High five.

71
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,278
Nick. Hey, Nick.

72
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:36,324
-Name, name. l need a name.
-Jennifer.

73
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:39,081
-Jennifer, hi, how are you?
-l'm great. Really great.

74
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:41,682
-Are you going to the bonfire tonight?
-You know it.

75
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:43,360
l was just saying to Shawn here...

76
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:46,360
...l cannot wait to go to the bonfire
so l can hang out with....

77
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:48,878
-Jennifer.
-Jennifer.

78
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:52,996
-I'll see you tonight.
-Okay, Jennifer.

79
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:58,203
-lt's not that hard a name to remember.
-l went out with her last semester.

80
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,517
The name gets erased
to make room for new ones.

81
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:04,123
-There's like 3000 kids at this school.
-Can't you just remember more names?

82
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,039
l don't know how it works.
Talk to Tech Support.

83
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:08,323
-There are my guys.
-Let's bet how many times...

84
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:10,637
-...he says "shit." l say seven.
-No way, 1 0.

85
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:11,956
-Hey, coach.
-Hey, coach.

86
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:13,560
Shitheads think you're the shit?

87
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:15,797
That you don't need
to pay attention out there?

88
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:19,243
I'll kick the shit out of you.
You pumped for football camp?

89
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:21,318
-l guess so.
-Yeah, two weeks without girls.

90
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:23,955
-Who wouldn't be pumped?
-Don't mess with me, shit-dick.

91
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:26,961
l am gonna push you like you've
never been pushed before.

92
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:29,083
Your muscles will ache,
your head will throb.

93
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:31,636
You'll shit blood out of holes
you never knew you had.

94
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:34,077
At least we're gonna
be in Daytona Beach.

95
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:38,160
No. Change it up this year.
Camp's gonna be in El Paso, Texas.

96
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:40,079
Hotter than your shithole.

97
00:06:40,247 --> 00:06:42,203
We're gonna get
you shits conditioned.

98
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,245
Bus leaves Monday
at 0-shit-hundred hours.

99
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:47,398
-Which is?
-4:45 a.m.

100
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:48,920
-Of course.
-The usual.

101
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,760
Skip your morning shit
and get down here.

102
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,836
Ten 'shits', you win.
How do you always know?

103
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,680
lt's a gift. l'm not proud of it.

104
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:00,836
Bye.

105
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:04,323
Maybe I'll see you
sometime this summer.

106
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:06,999
Don't be obvious.
He knows you like him.

107
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,919
You guys coming
to my dad's after camp?

108
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:11,157
-Hells, yeah. He gave it to you again?
-Nice.

109
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:13,238
He figures if he lets
me have it one week...

110
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,921
...I'll forgive him for not being there
when l need him.

111
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:18,203
And guess what. He's right.

112
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:22,038
Did you hear football camp's gonna
be in El Paso? How cool is that?

113
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:24,596
We gonna be sweating, hallucinating,
our skin burning.

114
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:27,156
Like being on shrooms,
but without girls to yell at us.

115
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:31,764
"Where's the car? Where's the car?
l'm getting scared. Hold my purse."

116
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:36,764
-Two weeks, Shawn. Two weeks.
-l know.

117
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:39,798
Two weeks out of the best
years of our lives.

118
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:42,242
Two weeks we're never
gonna get back, like, ever.

119
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:43,726
l know.

120
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,517
So are you guys psyched
for cheer camp or what?

121
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,086
lt's, like, all l think about.

122
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:51,205
Know how Martin Luther King
had a dream? Well, l do too.

123
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:55,485
To kick ass at cheer camp. And if
that makes me shallow, then fine.

124
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,322
-Call me and Dr. King shallow.
-That doesn't make you shallow.

125
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:01,321
That makes you real.

126
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:03,804
We have got to do better
than last year.

127
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:07,516
We could take a dump in our pants
and still do better than last year.

128
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,996
-l'm just saying.
-But we're better this year.

129
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:13,079
And if we work hard,
l think we have a real shot.

130
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:15,363
l don't know.
There's 300 girls up there...

131
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:17,438
...who want it just as much
as we do.

132
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:20,121
-And who are much better than us.
-Three hundred girls.

133
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:22,960
Who want it just as much as we do.

134
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,799
And are much better than us.

135
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:28,402
Tell you what, man,
that'd be the place to be.

136
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:31,764
lnstead of sweating our balls off
in the desert with Coach Shit-Shit.

137
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:35,923
-So let's go.
-What?

138
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:37,839
Let's go to cheer camp,
be cheerleaders.

139
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:39,565
-Cheerleaders?
-Yes.

140
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,683
Oh, my God.
Are you coming out to me?

141
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:43,405
l'm so proud of you, man.

142
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,762
And you know what,
l kind of always knew.

143
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:48,395
Will you shut up. All right,
l'm too straight to be gay.

144
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:50,364
l could suck knob
and still be straight.

145
00:08:50,527 --> 00:08:52,722
l could have one in my mouth
and two in each hand...

146
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:55,162
-...and still win a straight award.
-All right.

147
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,887
Which is why l wanna go
to cheer camp. Think.

148
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:01,119
Three hundred hotties
we've never been with before.

149
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:03,403
l wonder if they let guys
go to cheer camp.

150
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,680
Name, name. Give me a name.

151
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,644
-Carly. She's the captain.
-Hey, Carly.

152
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:11,197
Yeah, l know, it's the most beautiful
name you've ever heard...

153
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:12,920
...my eyes look like forever...

154
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:16,124
...and you love every bone in my body,
especially yours.

155
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,084
No, but that's good.
Mind if l use it?

156
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:19,441
No, no. No lines.

157
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:21,438
We wanted to wish you
luck at cheer camp.

158
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:24,758
Sure, you do. l know your game.
No girl left unturned.

159
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,520
-What?
-How dare you?

160
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:29,121
No. We just see how hard
you ladies cheer out there...

161
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:31,084
...and we really hope
that you do good.

162
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:35,081
Yeah, do us proud, you know. Beat
the skirts off those 300 other girls.

163
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:38,159
And guys? Are there guys there?
Do guys go?

164
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,522
-What about guys?
-lt's a good question.

165
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:43,121
There's girls and guys that go.
l don't know if guys--

166
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:45,118
Yes. The good teams are all co-ed.

167
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:48,558
That's interesting. l just didn't
know that. l was just pondering.

168
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:51,878
Carly, come here. We're working on
a new mount Bianca came up with.

169
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:54,003
-Yeah!
-Coming.

170
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:58,002
l'm gonna walk away backwards,
so you guys don't talk about my ass.

171
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,886
Man, she's got nice lumps.
Either one of us ever hit that?

172
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:03,607
l don't think so. l think
she respects herself too much.

173
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:04,836
Right.

174
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:06,679
Who wants to deal with that drama?

175
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:09,566
So, what do you think
about cheer camp?

176
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:11,843
-What do you mean, what do l think?
-Let's go.

177
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:14,760
-We're not cheerleaders.
-We're athletes, we can do anything.

178
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:17,725
They don't just let anybody go.
You've gotta be part of a squad.

179
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:19,684
Let's join a squad.
How hard can this be?

180
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:21,565
A couple of flips, a pyramid.

181
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:22,842
<i>B</i><i>lack sheep</i>

182
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:24,645
Three hundred honeys
on our biscuits.

183
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:27,640
-What about football camp?
-Screw football.

184
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:30,560
The only reason we started playing
was to pull chicks.

185
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:33,958
You can't honestly tell me you enjoy
running in blazing hot pads...

186
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:37,358
...trying to catch a pass two seconds
before some 2000-pound mongoloid...

187
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:40,599
-...crashes into your Nutter Butters.
-El Paso, here we come.

188
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,042
Not if it comes to us first!

189
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:45,360
Oh, shit.

190
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:46,886
-l'm on fire.
-Mookie!

191
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,959
-Water, water, water.
-I'll put you out.

192
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,480
l'm a hero.

193
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:54,357
Screw football. Let's go cheer.

194
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,485
Shawny Shawn!

195
00:10:58,047 --> 00:10:59,958
We need to convince
the squad they need us.

196
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,322
-Not gonna be easy.
-That's why we go to Poppy.

197
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:04,398
-l wish there was another way.
-There's not.

198
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,842
-But l wish there was.
-But there's not. We're here.

199
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:09,396
-l wish we weren't.
-But we are.

200
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:12,725
Hi, sis.

201
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,645
Why am l looking at you? Speak.

202
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,957
Poppy, you're getting so big now.
How old are you?

203
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:19,595
l'm 60. Can we get past
the small talk?

204
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:23,157
The only time you come to see me
is when you need something.

205
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:24,885
What? Tug mags?

206
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:26,765
Mike's Hard Lemonade?

207
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,396
-Another ride to the clinic?
-Poppy.

208
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:34,682
No. We wanna go to that
cheerleading camp you're going to.

209
00:11:34,847 --> 00:11:38,044
Since you're killing on the JV squad
and so advanced beyond your years...

210
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:39,799
...we thought you'd get us
up to speed.

211
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,923
Hey, buddy,
you can piss on my face...

212
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:43,566
...just don't tell me it's raining.

213
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:47,162
You guys have been through
every girl at your school...

214
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,318
...and you're looking
for fresh muff.

215
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:51,921
Some itchy-itchy-nah-nah.
Wall-to-wall carpet.

216
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,043
Okay, seriously, how old are you?

217
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:57,244
Tell you what, I'll teach you
some basic cheerleader moves.

218
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:59,477
High V's, low V's,
touchdown, baskets.

219
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:02,525
Don't the guys just throw
the girls up and then catch them?

220
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,123
Pretty much. But I'll let you practise
on me and tell you what they're called.

221
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:08,278
ln exchange, l get Shawn's room.

222
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:09,516
-No.
-Done.

223
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,006
Those are my terms.

224
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,237
-We'll take them.
-Dude, l've got my own bathroom.

225
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:16,240
Dude, after cheer camp, you won't
even need your own bathroom.

226
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:17,960
What? What does that even mean?

227
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:20,721
Poppy, you got yourself a deal.
Teach us, we go see Carly.

228
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:22,718
-Wrong, Gossip Girl.
-What?

229
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:25,685
Carly's not one of your humpety-hump
football groupies.

230
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:28,805
She's too smart to buy that you guys
wanna be cheerleaders.

231
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,286
Okay, so, what's the play?

232
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:40,486
-Here she comes, here she comes.
-Go, go. Get up there.

233
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:42,321
Oh, rats.

234
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:45,047
-We got our Frisbee stuck.
-How are we gonna get it down?

235
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:47,163
-Go space shuttle.
-That's what l'm thinking.

236
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,561
Good idea.

237
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,524
-Ready?
-Okay.

238
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:56,319
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six</i>
<i>Seven, grab, drop, catch</i>

239
00:12:58,407 --> 00:12:59,965
-Great job.
-Go, buddy.

240
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:01,879
Do they always get
so excited like that?

241
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,515
Haven't you ever seen them
do their touchdown dances?

242
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:08,646
l mean, they flip all over the place.
You'd think they were cheerleaders.

243
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:10,684
-No.
-You guys really like cheering?

244
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:12,758
That wasn't cheering,
just goofing around.

245
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:14,804
You nailed a backward sponge
and go cradle.

246
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:17,401
No. We threw my sister up in the air
to get our Frisbee.

247
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,603
lt was either that
or we get three ladders.

248
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:20,756
Come on, guys.

249
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:25,159
You love cheering. Don't run from it.
This is a safe place.

250
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:29,035
We kind of do. lt's so much
more athletic than football.

251
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:32,165
lf it were up to us, we'd go
with you ladies to cheer camp.

252
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:34,045
But we're football meatheads.

253
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:36,596
We gotta march in lockstep
to what society expects.

254
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:39,281
Don't tell anyone, okay?
Totally ruin our rep.

255
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:41,358
-We'll catch you later.
-Have a good summer.

256
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:43,438
We're gonna go watch
a Bears' game on TV.

257
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:45,598
<i>Go, Bears</i>

258
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:59,836
l'm supposed to believe
the biggest jocks in school...

259
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,083
...all along really wanted
to be cheerleaders?

260
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:05,319
Don't get caught up in the lockstep
of society's expectations.

261
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:07,318
They tossed Poppy
like 20 feet in the air.

262
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:09,717
Look, Carly,
we don't have any muscle.

263
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:13,277
lf you really wanna do better this year,
they're our only hope.

264
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:16,600
Unless you guys wanna try steroids,
which l'm totally open to.

265
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:20,678
-l'm just saying.
-l don't care. l don't trust those guys.

266
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,122
They're not coming. l'm the captain.

267
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:25,960
Miss Klingerhoff is the coach.
Let's see what she thinks.

268
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:31,200
What a fantastic idea.

269
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:35,482
lt's exactly what this squad needs
to just push it over the top.

270
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:38,002
But Miss Klingerhoff,
they have never done it before.

271
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:42,922
They don't know any of our cheers,
and, come on, it's Nick and Shawn.

272
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:44,964
Don't judge a book
by its cover, Carly.

273
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:49,365
You never really know what a book
is about until you get to page 50.

274
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:51,324
Fifty?

275
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:54,957
-Wouldn't guess a page over 40.
-More like 35.

276
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:57,076
My chickens.

277
00:14:58,247 --> 00:14:59,475
You come here, you.

278
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:06,797
All right. One down, one to go.

279
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:10,039
What are we gonna say to Coach
Shit-For-Words to get out of football?

280
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:13,085
What every kid says to get out
of everything he doesn't wanna do.

281
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:17,881
So not only do l find out yesterday
l'm adopted...

282
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,925
...the people l've called mom and
dad are infertile impostors...

283
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,079
...who bought me outside a meth clinic
for two boxes of Sudafed...

284
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:26,477
...but l also get
this news dropped on me:

285
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:29,241
My birth father, Bruce...

286
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,606
...well, he needs a kidney
and l'm the only match.

287
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,798
And apparently Bruce needs it stat.

288
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:37,802
You need it stat, Bruce? Huh?

289
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:40,601
l needed a father stat
instead of the stay-at-home dad...

290
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:43,964
...who showers me with love every
day, this goddamn spermless liar!

291
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:48,245
So now l gotta be at Kaiser
Permanente tomorrow at 6 a.m.

292
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,678
l know. Bruce couldn't even afford
a real hospital.

293
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:54,401
Managed care. lt's ironic, huh?

294
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:56,645
Never managed to care for me.

295
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:58,638
You shitting me?

296
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:00,798
Are you saying you can't go to camp?

297
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:03,117
Yeah, but don't make me say it,
coach.

298
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:07,485
Because it's eating me up inside.
lt's eating me up.

299
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:10,766
Shit!

300
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:15,002
-Cheer camp! Cheer camp!
-One, two.

301
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,725
Cheer camp! One, two.

302
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:19,961
You might have everyone else fooled,
but not me.

303
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,603
Well, if being a fool
for cheering is wrong...

304
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:24,880
...then l don't wanna be right.

305
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:27,402
You might wanna dial back
your bullshit with her.

306
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,795
She seems pretty with-it.

307
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,083
That's a great note. Thanks.

308
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:37,040
We're so psyched you're here.

309
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:39,163
-Yeah, us too. Oh, yeah.
-Me too, yeah, yeah.

310
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:40,442
Don't worry about Carly.

311
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:42,563
-She's really into cheering.
-No worries.

Just wait till their cycles match up.
You'll miss these days.

321
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,364
We're gonna miss
Mookie's dad's house.

322
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:15,995
Oh, buddy, we are not missing
Mookie's dad's house.

323
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:17,885
Yeah.
This thing is three weeks long.

324
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:22,006
Not for us, it isn't. We hook up
like maniacs, we bail in two.

00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:25,364
That's probably gonna piss
some people off.

326
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,483
To make an omelette,
you gotta break some eggs.

327
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,844
Grated cheese, slice some mushrooms,
salt, pepper, don't over-beat.

328
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,918
<i>We are driving again</i>
<i>We are driving</i>

329
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:36,764
<i>We are driving again</i>
<i>We are driving</i>

330
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:38,963
<i>We are driving again</i>
<i>We are driving</i>

331
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:40,196
Sorry.

332
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:44,155
l should say so, handsy.
At least buy me dinner first.

333
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:45,806
Very funny.

334
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,995
All right, now you're just
taking advantage of me.

335
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:57,240
<i>We are here</i>
<i>We, we are here</i>

336
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:00,720
l think we made a big mistake.

337
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:02,843
We may have screwed the pooch
on this one.

338
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,002
Or maybe the pooch
is gonna screw us.

339
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,601
Sweet Mary in a D-cup.

340
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:53,200
l think our bus crashed
and we're in heaven.

341
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:55,359
No. We would've heard:

342
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:59,076
<i>"We are crashing</i>
<i>We, we are crashing"</i>

343
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,083
Let's go see how warm the water is.

344
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:04,807
-Hi. Do l know you?
-l don't think so.

345
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:08,323
Well, l'm Nick. l'm new this year.
Maybe you could show me around.

346
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:10,796
-Who's this?
-Nick. He's new this year.

347
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:13,077
This is Shawn, also new,
needs showing around.

348
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:15,602
-lf it's not too much trouble.
-You gotta check in.

349
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:16,802
Okay, coming.

350
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:19,435
lt was very nice meeting you.
Hope we see you around.

351
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:22,883
I'll put a bookmark between you.
That way we know where we left off.

352
00:19:27,887 --> 00:19:29,525
Hi. What squad are you on?

353
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:37,242
Diora. l believe that's <i>italiano</i>
for " beautiful princess."

354
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:38,636
-No.
-Well, it should be.

355
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:41,401
-l'm calling the dictionary people.
-What squad are you on?

356
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,000
The Tigers, Gerald R. Ford High.

357
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,806
Below-average president,
above-average student body.

358
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,083
So, what are you doing later?

359
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:49,600
Not you.

360
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:51,845
What about accents?
You like Aussies?

361
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:53,360
You wanna wear my leather hat?

362
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:57,722
Mascots, I'll be checking you in
in 1 0 minutes at the mascot table.

363
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:01,360
-Why are you still here?
-You like canopy beds?

364
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:06,679
The last bus from Bitchville
just pulled in.

365
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:11,478
-Who's that?
-The Panthers.

366
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,559
They always come in first
and they don't let anyone forget it.

367
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:20,759
You guys came back.
l think that's so brave.

368
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,362
l just hope one day
there's a special cheer camp...

369
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:26,240
...where squads like yours
really have a shot.

370
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:27,436
-Shut up.
-Truth hurts.

371
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:29,996
-Your face is gonna hurt.
-Does your face hurt...

372
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:33,318
-...when you stuff it with pie?
-You wish you had my body image.

373
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:36,320
l'm healthy. Unlike you, Skeletor.

374
00:20:36,807 --> 00:20:38,638
We're a different team this year,
Gwyneth.

375
00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:41,275
Meet our new squad members.

376
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:42,675
l'm Nick. This is Shawn.

377
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:44,326
Hi. Great to meet you.

378
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:49,045
So you got a little sausage
in your soup this year. BFD.

379
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:52,240
-See you on the cheer field.
-lt's that big chunk of grass...

380
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:53,965
...you come in last on, every year.

381
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,845
Panthers out.

382
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:05,561
Panthers out?

383
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:07,240
What are they, a knife gang?

384
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:10,041
-God, l hate them.
-l think they're kind of cool.

385
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:12,806
l'm just saying.

386
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:24,440
Hey. l'm Nick. This is Shawn.

387
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:26,355
l'm Brewster.

388
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:28,522
Not my real name.

389
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,245
My parents named me Jack.

390
00:21:30,407 --> 00:21:34,719
Jack, so strong, so masculine.
We get it. You wanted a boy.

391
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:38,516
My name's Jack. l punch bad guys,
and l kiss girls.

392
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:40,484
-Save it.
-Okay.

393
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:44,925
Now, just a quick FY <i>información</i>,
l'm kind of a neat freak...

394
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:49,877
...so we'll get along great if you
just keep your area clean.

395
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:51,162
And by "area," you mean?

396
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:53,204
-Your bunks.
-Okay.

397
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:55,642
l can't stand clutter.
That's why we left Calcutta.

398
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:58,526
Well, that and my dad
took a job with United Airlines.

399
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:00,996
Your jobs aren't just
going over there, sailor.

400
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:04,921
Some of us are coming over here.
The world is flat like a son of a bitch.

401
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:07,282
You're giving us a lot to process here.

402
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:10,564
Hey, what's up, guys? l'm Adam.

403
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:12,922
What's up, man?
Hey, l'm Nick. This is Shawn.

404
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:14,836
Well, welcome, welcome.

405
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:17,396
-ls that your girlfriend?
-Yeah.

406
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:20,607
That's Jody. We've been cheering
together since we were 5.

407
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:22,921
So you take this seriously?

408
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:26,363
l wanna be the first in my family to
go to college on a cheer scholarship.

409
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:28,802
Good luck, man.
l hope you break the cycle.

410
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:30,082
-Thanks, man.
-Cool.

411
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:31,236
What's up, Eagle?

412
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:34,916
Mascots don't talk. They just gesture.

413
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,999
-Even in their bunks?
-The whole time, baby girl.

414
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:40,006
lt's total immersion.

415
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,123
Hey. Can someone
help me with my stuff?

416
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,478
l got a huge bag of footballs,
beer, Xbox games.

417
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:46,921
Let's get this party started.

418
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:49,402
Finally, a kindred spirit.
l'm Nick. This is Shawn.

419
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,523
-l'm Downey.
-What's up? Nice to meet you.

420
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:54,679
Downey. Downey. All right,
so break it down for us.

421
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:56,678
How great is this place?

422
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:59,077
-lt's sick, dude.
-Sweet. Right there.

423
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:02,444
The coaches are amazing. Your
cheering's gonna be off the charts.

424
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:05,565
My cheering's gonna be off the charts.
l guess that's a good thing.

425
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:07,877
What about the ladies?
Tell me about the ladies.

426
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:10,083
Oh, yeah, totally.

427
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:14,276
Their cheering gets better too.
They see real progress.

428
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:17,796
What the...?

429
00:23:18,887 --> 00:23:23,324
Wow, look at them all, dude. ln rows.
lt's like the hot-chick produce aisle.

430
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,846
l don't know where to start.

431
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:27,521
Do we go from tall to short
or blond to redhead?

432
00:23:27,687 --> 00:23:29,643
Maybe just iPod-shuffle mode.

433
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:32,924
This is why l'd never wanna
be president. Too many decisions.

434
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:35,157
Don't worry,
l don't think that's in the cards.

435
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:39,161
You say that now, but George W.
was a cheerleader at Yale.

436
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:40,965
He never thought
he'd be president...

437
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:44,278
...snorting coke through his skull and
bones at a New Haven titty bar.

438
00:23:44,447 --> 00:23:46,039
You just never know, Shawnzy.

439
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:49,517
And that is what makes America great.
Any idiot can be president.

440
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:52,520
-Let's hear some noise over here!
-Noise over here!

441
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:55,121
-Let's hear some noise over here!
-Noise over here!

442
00:23:55,287 --> 00:23:57,562
-Are you fired up?
-We're fired up!

443
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,957
-Are you fired up?
-We're fired up!

444
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:01,879
-How do you spell "fired up"?
-F-U!

445
00:24:02,047 --> 00:24:03,321
Not really.

446
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:05,523
-How do you spell "fired up"?
-F-U!

447
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:07,518
-What's that spell?
-Fired up!

448
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:09,206
-Not really that way either.
-Nope.

449
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:12,564
Damn straight. F-U.
You're at university now.

450
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:14,365
-Fired Up University.
-This is awesome.

451
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:17,718
Cheer college, my friends. None
of this high school stuff for you.

452
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:21,562
You got three weeks. We're gonna
take it right to the top to F-U.

453
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,763
-F-U!
-F-U!

454
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:28,959
Howdy do? My name is Coach Keith.
l'm the skipper of this spirit ship.

455
00:24:29,127 --> 00:24:32,597
As many of you know, l was
the very first male cheerleader ever...

456
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,678
...to compete at the Nationals.

457
00:24:34,847 --> 00:24:36,644
l was born cheering.

458
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:39,275
My mother swears
the first thing out of her what's-it...

459
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:42,041
...was a little pair of baby hands
doing spirit fingers.

460
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:47,198
That's a joke, but it really happened.

461
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:50,124
lt is now my absolute pleasure...

462
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:52,278
...to introduce to you
your head counsellor...

463
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:56,679
...and my super-sexy handsome wife,
Diora. Let's bring her out here.

464
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:03,957
-What? Did he say wife?
-No, he couldn't have.

465
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,116
Welcom<i>e, e</i>veryone.

466
00:25:05,327 --> 00:25:08,717
For the next three weeks, you'll train
with me and the other coaches...

467
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:10,605
...and then compete in a tournament...

468
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:14,043
...with the top teams going on
to the State Finals.

469
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:19,324
So that would be the Panthers
and two other teams.

470
00:25:21,247 --> 00:25:23,636
-Oh, me, me, me.
-Yes, ma'am, right here.

471
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:27,197
l heard that there was this really hard
move called the Fountain of Troy...

472
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,085
...that some team did at the Worlds.

473
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:30,362
Are we gonna learn that?

474
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:33,405
Sure, I'll teach you
how to do the Fountain of Troy.

475
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:37,405
Then I'll teach you
to put makeup on a bear!

476
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:39,479
Absolutely not.

477
00:25:39,647 --> 00:25:43,162
Not only is that move nearly impossible
to execute, it's extremely dangerous.

478
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,085
That move is prohibidado.

479
00:25:45,287 --> 00:25:47,243
-Prohibi-what?
-Prohibidado.

480
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:51,878
And l say that in Spanish because
that's how exotic and not-allowed it is.

481
00:25:52,047 --> 00:25:54,686
You can't even say " Fountain of Troy"
at this cheer camp.

482
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:57,156
-Go ahead and say it.
-Fountain of Tr--!

483
00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:59,841
Stop it. What are you doing?
This isn't a game.

484
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:01,565
l'm not playing around up here.

485
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:02,842
Honey.

486
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:06,323
lt's just a joke.
First week of cheer camp.

487
00:26:06,847 --> 00:26:07,882
Lighten things up.

488
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:10,436
Have a good time.
Everybody say it, " Fountain of Troy."

489
00:26:10,607 --> 00:26:13,565
-Fountain of Tr--!
-Oh, my dear Lord! Oh, gosh, shut up!

490
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:15,479
He's lost his mind.

491
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:18,366
Stop it! Nobody does the
Fountain of Troy at this cheer camp.

492
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,916
Now, let's all hit the bunks
and get a good night's sleep.

493
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:22,281
Welcome to cheer camp.

494
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:34,916
Hi.

495
00:26:36,687 --> 00:26:39,599
Dibs, dibs. Dibs on the blond
with the butterfly tattoo.

496
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,803
Dibs on that. l'd like that.
Tell me who it is.

497
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,958
-This is Lanie Brown.
-Lanie Brown.

498
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:47,244
She likes skiing, hip-hop, and playing
with her cat, Sir Pembleton.

499
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,716
-Sir Pembleton? You serious?
-l know, l'm not kidding.

500
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:52,037
l'm gonna write her name
in my book in no time.

501
00:26:52,207 --> 00:26:54,038
Can't believe you document
your conquests.

502
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:56,357
Family owns a payroll company.
Love records.

503
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,438
-lt's just weird.
-Tell it to our dog, FlCA.

504
00:26:58,607 --> 00:26:59,722
Oh, hey, Carly.

505
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:01,161
What's up, Tigers?

506
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:03,085
-Hey.
-Going to take a shower?

507
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,681
Yeah. l had my hand
in some kid's mouth this morning.

508
00:27:05,887 --> 00:27:08,447
Good idea. l know where it's been.

509
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:11,326
And if l don't get some
flesh-eating virus from that...

510
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:13,637
...l probably will
after l take a shower barefoot.

511
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:16,361
-l forgot to pack my flip-flops.
-Sucks! See you later.

512
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:18,040
Oh, here. Take mine.

513
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,644
-l brought two pair.
-Really?

514
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,275
Yeah. No problem.
We're teammates.

515
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:25,842
Thanks.

516
00:27:29,087 --> 00:27:31,203
-Bye.
-See you later.

517
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:35,916
Bro, what did l tell you? No hooking
up with girls from our school.

518
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,123
-l was just being nice.
-l don't care, man.

519
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:39,561
You know where nice leads.

520
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:41,718
Do not poop where you eat,
remember?

521
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:45,886
That's why there are no
restaurants called The Bathroom.

522
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:48,603
There are bathrooms at restaurants.

523
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,685
l was using a metaphor, Shawn.

524
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:54,522
lt is crazy that people think
that you're the smart one.

525
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:57,045
What's up, ladies?

526
00:27:57,207 --> 00:27:58,401
Hi.

527
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:01,559
You wanna borrow some flip-flops?
All right, see you later.

528
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:09,120
Welcome to day on<i>e, e</i>verybody.
Let's start with a warm-up run.

529
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:12,956
God, she's such a fox. l guarantee
l'm gonna tap that before we leave.

530
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:15,875
Dude, she's married,
and like 30 years old.

531
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:19,039
That's just how l like them:
ancient and regretful.

532
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:21,243
Yeah. Take it easy on the Dove bars.

533
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:23,159
-Ready, Shawnzy?
-Sure am, Nicholai.

534
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,396
New guys, move them.

535
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:30,961
l always knew there was
something else l should be doing.

536
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,516
You know,
like there was something more.

537
00:28:34,407 --> 00:28:36,238
Something more inside me.

538
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:39,319
l guess you could say
l had a cheer waiting to get out.

539
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:43,845
And now, well, l live to cheer.

540
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:47,965
And l cheer to live.

541
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,164
l looked that little kitten
in the eyes...

542
00:28:55,327 --> 00:28:56,999
...and l knew l had to take her home.

543
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:01,399
And now, Sniffles,
that's who l tell my secrets to.

544
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,398
My grandmother was a cheerleader.

545
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:05,558
lt was what she loved most
in the world.

546
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:10,842
So when she died, l just
picked up the family pom-poms.

547
00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:14,158
This is weird.
l don't usually open up like this.

548
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:17,842
lt's weird.
l don't usually open up like this.

549
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:44,244
<i>Tigers!</i>

550
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:46,758
l love every bone in your body.

551
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:48,918
Especially mine...?

552
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:12,636
<i>Tigers!</i>

553
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:28,723
<i>Tigers can't be beat</i>
<i>Get up on your feet</i>

554
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:30,400
<i>Tigers can't be beat</i>

555
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:33,320
ls it my imagination, or do they
not completely, totally suck?

556
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:35,205
lt's your imagination.

557
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,164
Now go imagine me
a bottle of water.

558
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:39,560
<i>Tigers!</i>

559
00:30:47,407 --> 00:30:50,285
The French say a day moon brings
good luck to whoever sees it.

560
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:52,403
They also say 8-year-olds
should drink wine.

561
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:56,037
And if it's a crescent moon,
it'll bring good luck for a week.

562
00:30:56,967 --> 00:30:58,286
What is it now?

563
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:02,042
l'm jogging with the captain of the best
squad, so l'd say it's pretty crescent.

564
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:03,925
-Race you.
-Cheering isn't a race.

565
00:31:04,087 --> 00:31:06,885
-This isn't football.
-There's a competition at the end.

566
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:10,084
Yeah, you're right.
On your mark, get set....

567
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:12,124
Oh, she cheats. l like it.

568
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,402
Zucchini?

569
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,000
Leafy greens? Kale? Jicama?

570
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:18,196
And sprouts?

571
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:20,597
That's the only thing
that sucks about cheer camp.

572
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:22,439
The sacrifices
l make for ass.

573
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:25,485
Remember when l pretended to
be into Nickelback for that chick?

574
00:31:25,647 --> 00:31:28,480
-God, they suck.
-So did she. Up top.

575
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:32,162
Dude, l am not gonna high-five you
for a beejer you got a year ago.

576
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:34,199
That doesn't count. No.

577
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,601
-Poppy.
-Hi, sis.

578
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,359
Guys looking to go off-menu?

579
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:41,564
l got Kit Kats, Snickers,
and German sweet tarts.

580
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,998
Wipes out the taste
of every other candy.

581
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:48,119
I'll take everything you got.

582
00:31:48,447 --> 00:31:51,325
Not here, Shawshank.
The screws are watching.

583
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:54,206
Put it in the sycamore tree
out back.

584
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:57,242
-Where's our candy gonna be?
-Check your pockets.

585
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:04,280
l know. She's got the shine.

586
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,317
Oh, my God, this is so good.

587
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:13,082
Yeah, it is.

588
00:32:14,847 --> 00:32:15,836
Diora!

589
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:20,760
Diora!

590
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:23,002
God, it is you.

591
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:24,998
The way the moonlight
caught your cheek...

592
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:27,397
...for a second there,
l thought you were an angel.

593
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:29,478
Nope, just the head
counsellor who decides...

594
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,956
...whether or not to make you
run laps all tomorrow.

595
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:35,244
God, l love it, huh?

596
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:38,439
A little back and forth, witty repartee,
Hepburn and Tracy.

597
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:40,518
l'm not 1 6, kiddo.
Run along and play.

598
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:42,837
Still with the witty repartee,
that's terrific.

599
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:46,317
-You win this round, Miss Tracy.
-Hepburn was the girl.

600
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:48,205
Ding, ding. Knockout.

601
00:32:51,647 --> 00:32:54,036
lt shouldn't be this hard,
she's like 1 00 years old.

602
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:57,877
-Shawn. Got a second?
-Yeah. Sure.

603
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:01,441
Some of the girls have been
talking about you and Nick.

604
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:03,598
Don't believe anything anyone says.

605
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:06,998
They've been saying they think this is
the best the team has ever been.

606
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,364
Well, that you can believe.

607
00:33:09,527 --> 00:33:12,121
l just wanted to say thanks.

608
00:33:12,487 --> 00:33:14,523
You guys have been a big help.

609
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,760
Especially you.

610
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:19,681
Thanks.

611
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:23,203
lt's nice to know that when l get tossed,
you're gonna be there to catch me.

612
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:25,198
l mean, not that Bianca wasn't good.

613
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:28,916
lt's just, l don't know. You feel right.

614
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:31,157
l like it too.
You're like a home-run ball.

615
00:33:31,327 --> 00:33:35,002
Fifteen-inch brown trout.
A mild cold. Double feature.

616
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:37,078
l get it. Things that you catch.
Shut up.

617
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:38,682
l know at the beginning...

618
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:41,520
...l may have been against
you two joining the squad--

619
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,962
l believe you called us
"godless douche-monsters."

620
00:33:44,127 --> 00:33:45,879
lt was "soulless beav-wranglers."

621
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:48,766
Well, that's better.
l totally misunderstood you.

622
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,201
l'm trying to apologise here.

623
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:52,517
No need. And accepted.

624
00:33:56,287 --> 00:33:57,766
Hey.

625
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:02,043
You'd think as a cheerleader
l would be a little more graceful.

626
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:06,323
l like you clumsy.
lt's like l'm looking behind the curtain.

627
00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:09,756
Babe.

628
00:34:11,487 --> 00:34:12,522
Rick.

629
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:15,319
Rick.

630
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:19,796
-Who's the fac<i>e-e</i>ater?
-Guys, come meet my boyfriend.

631
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:24,524
-What is with that car?
-Maybe he won an LPGA tournament.

632
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:32,761
l missed you.

633
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:34,997
Me too. Definitely.

634
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,964
Guys, this is my boyfriend.

635
00:34:37,127 --> 00:34:40,199
-Pre-fiancé, actually.
-These are the guys l told you about.

636
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:43,040
-Nick and Shawn.
-What's up, guys? l'm Dr. Rick.

637
00:34:45,327 --> 00:34:46,316
Really?

638
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:48,836
Pound?

639
00:34:49,007 --> 00:34:50,998
Aren't you a little young
to be a doctor?

640
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,317
-He's pre-med.
-Then why call yourself "doctor"?

641
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:54,840
Why put off the inevitable?

642
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,724
You should get
that mole checked out.

643
00:34:58,927 --> 00:35:02,397
l'd do it myself,
but l don't have my bag on me.

644
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:04,606
Your book bag?

645
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:07,918
-How'd you two crazy kids meet, Rick?
-lt's a funny story, actually.

646
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:11,836
Our parents knew each other from
way back, and they introduced us.

647
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:19,315
Not that funny a story. Not really
even a story. Just like a fact.

648
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:21,717
We've been going out
since l was a sophomore.

649
00:35:21,927 --> 00:35:25,636
We should hit it, Carly. l told the guys
we'd be done dinner in 45.

650
00:35:25,887 --> 00:35:28,959
-The guys are with you?
-lt was a long-ass drive, babe.

651
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,119
You didn't want me falling asleep
at the wheel, did you?

652
00:35:32,287 --> 00:35:33,800
No, l'm glad you made it.

653
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:37,118
Yeah, you're glad.
l got a rezzy at Red Lobster.

654
00:35:37,287 --> 00:35:40,245
We've got a booth in the back
behind a plant...

655
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:43,319
...so no one can see how much
we're all-you-can-eating.

656
00:35:43,847 --> 00:35:45,963
lf you know what l'm saying, boys.

657
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:49,556
Okay. Oh, Shawn.
l have something for you.

658
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:56,685
Sweet deal you kids
got going on here.

659
00:35:56,847 --> 00:35:58,519
Wish l could hang out,
play all summer.

660
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:01,765
l'm just a little busy
picking my speciality.

661
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:03,963
Speciality? You're a freshman.

662
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:06,800
Your speciality should be putting a cow
in the dean's office.

663
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:09,117
<i>Anima</i>/ <i>House</i> reference. Love it!

664
00:36:12,447 --> 00:36:14,881
My mom sent mine,
so l don't need yours anymore.

665
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,719
-Thanks.
-Sure.

666
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:22,445
And, chief. Next time, if my girl needs
something, she can borrow it from me.

667
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:25,446
Rick, he was just being nice.

668
00:36:25,607 --> 00:36:28,041
Those feet look pretty small.
What are they, a seven?

669
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:29,720
Ten and a half, papo.

670
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,683
Eleven in Crocs.

671
00:36:40,607 --> 00:36:43,599
What's the name of that girl
who was 5'7", blond hair, blue eyes?

672
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:45,837
She's like a dragon.
Reminds me of Christmas.

673
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:50,363
lt's Carols, Care-holes, Car--
Caroline. Caroline.

674
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:52,444
l'm running out of ink.
You got a pen?

675
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:54,006
Mopey, l'm talking to you here.

676
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:56,761
You been sitting out here staring
into space for two hours.

677
00:36:56,927 --> 00:36:59,566
-lt's been five minutes.
-Really? That was five minutes?

678
00:36:59,727 --> 00:37:02,605
Guess l really do suck in bed.

679
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:05,687
Get it? Like l think l'm Sting,
and in all reality...

680
00:37:05,847 --> 00:37:09,123
...l'm like Chad Michael Murray
douching it out in five minutes.

681
00:37:09,287 --> 00:37:10,606
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

682
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:12,485
-Come on, tell me.
-lt's nothing.

683
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,716
-Tell me.
-lt's nothing.

684
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:16,959
Tell me. Tell me, tell me, tell me....

685
00:37:17,127 --> 00:37:18,401
-Nick.
-Sorry.

686
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:21,277
-Tell me?
-Carly's boyfriend's a real schwanz.

687
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,915
Dude, you like her. l knew it.
l knew you liked her.

688
00:37:24,087 --> 00:37:25,725
-So? lt's no big deal.
-No big deal?

689
00:37:25,887 --> 00:37:28,037
She's on our squad.
You're gonna ruin everything.

690
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:31,722
Why you gotta do this, huh? Why you
gotta take a leak all over my dreams?

691
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:33,878
Why you lay a hot toddy
all over my hopes?

692
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:36,481
-You're being a little dramatic.
-Well, l have never.

693
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,996
What makes this girl so great, bro?

694
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:42,079
Yeah. What makes this girl
so great, bro?

695
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:43,805
There's just something about her.

696
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:46,322
You know when she bumped into me
on the bus?

697
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:51,163
Or when l saw her reading that book.
That she orders pudding for dessert.

698
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:54,046
Okay, now you're just listing things
that people do.

699
00:37:54,207 --> 00:37:55,765
No, l'm not.

700
00:37:55,927 --> 00:37:59,078
-Sometimes she writes with a pencil.
-So much worse than l thought.

701
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,755
You're really into this girl.

702
00:38:00,927 --> 00:38:02,201
-No, l'm not.
-Yes, you are.

703
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,323
Why is she with that knob-rocket?

704
00:38:04,487 --> 00:38:07,240
Enough already. You're even
depressing me, and l'm a Virgo.

705
00:38:07,407 --> 00:38:09,477
We have got to cheer you up.

706
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:11,958
l'm two steps ahead of you, my man.

707
00:38:12,127 --> 00:38:14,277
All right, gentlemen, saddle up.

708
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:17,883
Listen, ladies,
l couldn't help but notice...

709
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:20,277
...you were practising your lifts
on dry ground.

710
00:38:20,447 --> 00:38:22,085
Well, where else
would we practise?

711
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:27,003
The pond. That's where the top teams
do. Water resistance, better training.

712
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,044
Why do you think octopuses
have skinny arms?

713
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,686
That sounds like a good idea.

714
00:38:30,887 --> 00:38:33,606
We can't. Our swimsuits are
all the way back at the bunks.

715
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:37,644
We could just go in our underwear.
l mean, that's all swimsuits are.

716
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:40,480
lt's gonna be dark soon anyway,
so no one would see us.

717
00:38:40,647 --> 00:38:44,242
l never thought about it like that,
but l guess you're right.

718
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:46,841
Look at that. We're all here
thinking inside the box...

719
00:38:47,007 --> 00:38:49,157
...and you're outside
playing a game of "What lf?"

720
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,558
Gorgeous and brilliant.
The triple threat.

721
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,602
And we're off. Gentlemen, ladies.

722
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:59,040
Adam, you've done enough
working out. Let's go.

723
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:04,400
Oh, there it is.

724
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:09,841
l am so excited.

725
00:39:10,007 --> 00:39:12,680
l have not been skinny dipping
since lndian Scouts.

726
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:15,485
Nobody look.

727
00:39:16,327 --> 00:39:17,885
Windmill.

728
00:39:18,047 --> 00:39:20,845
We're leaving our underwear on.
We talked about this, remember?

729
00:39:21,007 --> 00:39:22,565
You talked. l listened.

730
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:27,919
Paint the fence. Cutting the cake.
Hangman's noose. Hangman's noose.

731
00:39:28,087 --> 00:39:29,600
lncoming.

732
00:39:38,927 --> 00:39:43,796
Misjudged the depth.
lt's all good. Learn from me.

733
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:18,195
This feels great.

734
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:20,437
lt's the water resistance.
lt helps strengthen.

735
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:22,598
lt's twice the compound,
half the measure...

736
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:26,442
-...and if you equivalate that to--
-Nick. Enough of that.

737
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:28,677
-Enough of what?
-Drop the game.

738
00:40:28,847 --> 00:40:32,157
There are 300 girls at this camp
and only four straight guys.

739
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:35,205
lt's no mystery why you're ripping
through the place. So come on.

740
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:39,960
Come on.

741
00:40:40,927 --> 00:40:42,326
Tick tock.

742
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:46,077
Oh, all right.

743
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:54,240
You're next.

744
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,236
Ladies.

745
00:41:04,407 --> 00:41:06,716
-Where are our clothes?
-We left them right here.

746
00:41:06,887 --> 00:41:09,720
l know. That's why l'm saying,
"Where are our clothes?"

747
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:13,675
l'm blazing a trail. l'm blazing a trail.

748
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,166
See you guys.

749
00:41:15,327 --> 00:41:17,443
-Okay, have a great Thanksgiving.
-What?

750
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:18,642
l don't know, l'm cold.

751
00:41:22,007 --> 00:41:24,202
-l'm cold and l'm flailing.
-l know, l know.

752
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:25,641
How are you not flailing?

753
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:27,923
l'm flailing. l too am also flailing.

754
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:31,085
-So how was she?
-How was who?

755
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:33,761
-The blond you were making time with.
-l wasn't.

756
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:36,999
We just talked. She's really nice.
Her grandmother's from Cincinnati.

757
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:39,238
She helped me on
my crossover basket launches.

758
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:41,398
l can't believe how high
my extensions are.

759
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:43,478
l don't know who you are anymore.

760
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:46,078
Boys.

761
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:48,317
What are you doing?
lt's way past curfew.

762
00:41:48,487 --> 00:41:49,556
We were just....

763
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:53,245
Practising.

764
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:55,526
-Yeah.
-Al dente?

765
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:59,197
Yeah. We like to do cheers in the nude
so that they really sink in.

766
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:02,086
That way our bodies learn it
as well as our minds.

767
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:05,527
That's very Alvin Ailey of you.
l like it.

768
00:42:05,687 --> 00:42:08,326
-Proceed.
-Proceed with what, running away?

769
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:10,239
No, with the cheer, you goose.

770
00:42:10,407 --> 00:42:13,604
Don't you wanna wait for
another coach? Or a witness?

771
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:14,882
Five, six, seven, eight.

772
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:16,236
-Ready?
-Okay.

773
00:42:16,407 --> 00:42:17,635
<i>Hey, Tigers!</i>

774
00:42:17,807 --> 00:42:19,081
<i>-Yeah?</i>
<i>-Hey, Tigers!</i>

775
00:42:19,247 --> 00:42:22,796
<i>Yeah? What do we</i> <i>like to eat?</i>
<i>Panther meat</i>

776
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:24,446
<i>l said, hey, Tigers!</i>

777
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:26,040
<i>-Yeah?</i>
<i>-Hey, Tigers!</i>

778
00:42:26,207 --> 00:42:29,563
<i>Yeah? What do we</i> <i>like to do?</i>
<i>Defeat</i>

779
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,083
-Dude, your crankshaft.
-Two.

780
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:34,927
<i>Orange, b</i><i>lack and white unite</i>

781
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:37,476
<i>Tigers, Tigers, fight, fight, fight!</i>

782
00:42:37,647 --> 00:42:39,285
Tailpipe.

783
00:42:41,247 --> 00:42:43,238
Your counts are off,
your spacing is insane...

784
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,967
...and your moves sloppier
than a kiss from a midshipman.

785
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:48,886
-What?
-Take it from the top. Positions.

786
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,641
Parallel positions!

787
00:42:50,807 --> 00:42:52,559
Five, six, seven, eight.

788
00:42:52,727 --> 00:42:55,799
<i>Go bananas</i>
<i>Go, go bananas</i>

789
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:59,516
<i>Go bananas</i>
<i>Go, go bananas</i>

790
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,124
You can put me down now.

791
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:05,646
Oh, can l?

792
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:07,721
You jerk.

793
00:43:08,407 --> 00:43:09,396
Jack-knocker.

794
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:11,125
Oh, look.

795
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:13,881
-What are they doing?
-lt's the Fountain of Troy.

796
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,958
l thought that move
was prohibidimabido.

797
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:20,558
-My face!
-lt's okay, it's okay.

798
00:43:20,727 --> 00:43:22,763
What'd l tell you about
that Fountain of Troy?

799
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:24,485
Look, you broke her face.

800
00:43:24,647 --> 00:43:27,798
Where am l gonna get another one
of those this late in the day?

801
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:29,764
Someone call a doctor!

802
00:43:29,927 --> 00:43:31,201
Damn, l wish Rick were here.

803
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:34,165
Why, so he could ask someone
to call a doctor?

804
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:37,598
Ever been to
a cheerleading competition?

805
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:39,644
Oh, you mean like a football game?

806
00:43:39,807 --> 00:43:42,640
No, not a game.
Those are like practises for us.

807
00:43:42,807 --> 00:43:44,718
l'm talking about a tournament.

808
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:48,596
ESPN cameras all around. Hundreds
of people in crowds cheering.

809
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:51,440
Wait.
People cheering cheerleaders?

810
00:43:53,887 --> 00:43:55,878
You should be in the movies.

811
00:43:56,087 --> 00:43:59,204
You're hotter than all of these
cheerleaders rolled together.

812
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:02,401
Cheerleaders rolled together.

813
00:44:04,847 --> 00:44:06,166
l gotta take a Louis Leakey.

814
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:10,081
Listen, you, don't get any cuter
while l'm gone. l'm serious.

815
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:13,364
And let me give you a little tip
from a cheerleader.

816
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:16,883
<i>Be aggressive</i>
<i>B-E aggressive</i>

817
00:44:18,687 --> 00:44:21,724
Where's that Jesse Bradford boy?
l love him. No, seriously.

818
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,525
Seriously. l love him.

819
00:44:26,807 --> 00:44:28,206
l gotta be honest with you, man.

820
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:30,597
l don't think l'm into
all this hooking up anymore.

821
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:33,327
-lt feels wrong.
-Yeah, it's supposed to feel wrong.

822
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:35,000
No, l mean, l feel guilty.

823
00:44:35,207 --> 00:44:37,880
l don't know what you're saying.
Milty? Wilty?

824
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:39,162
Something's not right.

825
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:42,046
-Tilty?
-l've never felt this way before.

826
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:43,802
Maquilty?

827
00:44:48,567 --> 00:44:50,159
ls that Dr. Rick?

828
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:55,125
Awesome song.

829
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:59,800
Dude, these local chicks are so easy.
lt's like banging fish in a barrel.

830
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:03,516
That Gina was a freak. l've got
bite marks all over my badonkadonk.

831
00:45:03,887 --> 00:45:06,355
Or was that Aubrey?
Whichever one smells like lavender.

832
00:45:06,527 --> 00:45:07,801
l got that stuff all over me.

833
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,401
One of you smell my rod,
will you?

834
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,125
Jesus. This guy's a dick.

835
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:14,801
l don't get why you came here.
You don't even like Carly.

836
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:17,242
l told you, man.
Our parents are old friends...

837
00:45:17,407 --> 00:45:20,638
...which means they approve of her,
they give me anything l want...

838
00:45:20,807 --> 00:45:23,765
...including this sick
3-series Beemer, with nav...

839
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:25,758
...that drove your fat ass up here.

840
00:45:25,927 --> 00:45:27,201
Rock it.

841
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,519
Why you gotta take a shot
at my weight?

842
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:30,961
You know l'm working on it.

843
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:32,156
He's just using her.

844
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:35,916
And he likes to get bit in
the badonkadonk, that sick bastard.

845
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:37,076
l gotta tell her.

846
00:45:37,247 --> 00:45:40,319
-Yeah, no, buddy. Don't tell her.
-No, l have to.

847
00:45:40,527 --> 00:45:41,755
No, no, you really don't.

848
00:45:41,927 --> 00:45:42,996
Yeah, l kind of do.

849
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:47,001
lt's pretty obvious that you're gonna
go against everything l stand for...

850
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:51,638
...and poop where you eat, so at least
let me help you take that poop, okay?

851
00:45:51,807 --> 00:45:53,684
Trust me, bro, don't tell her.

852
00:45:53,847 --> 00:45:56,441
Why? She needs to find out
what kind of guy he really is.

853
00:45:56,607 --> 00:46:00,316
lf you tell her, you'll be the guy who
told her her boyfriend is cheating.

854
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:03,604
-Yeah?
-Bro, that's all you're ever gonna be.

855
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:06,076
Best-case scenario,
she looks at you as a girlfriend.

856
00:46:06,247 --> 00:46:09,603
Worst-case scenario, she's pissed
at you for poking in her business.

857
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:11,843
Either way, you're not poking
in her business.

858
00:46:12,887 --> 00:46:13,876
You marinate with that.

859
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,716
-l hear you. That's good advice.
-lt is good advice.

860
00:46:19,887 --> 00:46:21,684
-Thanks.
-That's what friends are for.

861
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:22,962
-Are you good?
-l'm good.

862
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:24,202
Carly!

863
00:46:24,887 --> 00:46:27,640
Hey, Carly. There's something
l have to tell you. Carly!

864
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,438
l was wondering where you were.

865
00:46:30,607 --> 00:46:33,644
l was looking for you too.
But you go first. What's up?

866
00:46:33,807 --> 00:46:36,321
l was just wondering
about the moon.

867
00:46:36,487 --> 00:46:40,400
l mean, is it still crescent
or a half-moon?

868
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:42,205
What the French
have to say about it?

869
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:44,756
l'm an idiot.

870
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:49,000
No. No, it's a waxing crescent moon
tonight, and you're not an idiot.

871
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:51,476
Unless you don't know
what "waxing" means.

872
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,445
l'm a cheerleader,
l know what "waxing" means.

873
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:57,757
-Carly horse.
-Rick.

874
00:46:57,927 --> 00:47:00,805
-That's what he calls you?
-Yeah. He means it cute.

875
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,359
-What's up, high school?
-You smell like lavender.

876
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:08,326
Yeah.

877
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:10,955
We're learning about the effects
of lavender therapy...

878
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:12,805
...on type-two carcinoma patients.

879
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:17,677
How's that working out? Anyone go
into remission after smelling a flower?

880
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,839
All right, you caught me, man.

881
00:47:23,527 --> 00:47:27,600
-l picked you some flowers, Carly.
-That is so sweet. Where are they?

882
00:47:28,447 --> 00:47:31,007
l made a special wish on them
and threw them into the sky.

883
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:32,436
That is so romantic.

884
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:36,122
We should hit it, Carlito's Way. l told
the guys l'd be done with dinner in 40.

885
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:38,200
I'll see you at practise?

886
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:40,676
Shawn here is a great
leather-basket tosser.

887
00:47:42,007 --> 00:47:43,679
What a great trick.

888
00:47:43,847 --> 00:47:45,246
Not as good as yours.

889
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,159
I'll see you tomorrow, Shawn.

890
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:05,527
-Awesome date.
-I'll see you at the competition?

891
00:48:05,687 --> 00:48:07,279
l wouldn't miss it for the world.

892
00:48:14,487 --> 00:48:15,476
Bye.

893
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,236
l like you a lot, Carles Barkley.
You're one of the good ones, babe.

894
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:43,643
You know what reminds me
of the better times?

895
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:47,686
Before Carly started hanging out
with those two little suck-buckets.

896
00:48:47,887 --> 00:48:49,320
Something's up with them.

897
00:48:49,487 --> 00:48:51,478
Wanna stay and do some digging?

898
00:48:51,647 --> 00:48:53,763
Big-time. You know why?

899
00:48:59,527 --> 00:49:04,123
Awesome song. Chumbawamba.
lt's the soundtrack to my life, man.

900
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:12,800
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

901
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:14,525
<i>Go, Tigers!</i>

902
00:49:14,727 --> 00:49:17,446
Cradle. One, two.

903
00:49:20,687 --> 00:49:22,882
Great job, guys.
Let's take a little water break.

904
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:25,402
Are my hips rotating too late
before the final toss?

905
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:28,604
l wasn't gonna say anything,
but you gotta rotate and then catch.

906
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:30,485
Rotate, then catch.

907
00:49:30,647 --> 00:49:33,320
-We're out of water.
-We need two volunteers to refill.

908
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:34,602
-I'll go.
-Me too.

909
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:38,158
Dude, don't go. Hey, Shawn.

910
00:49:38,887 --> 00:49:39,876
God--

911
00:49:40,047 --> 00:49:42,356
That was really good.
Keep it up, okay?

912
00:49:43,087 --> 00:49:44,486
Hi.

913
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,476
Listen, l don't know
if l've told you this yet...

914
00:49:48,647 --> 00:49:51,844
...but your coaching, l mean,
it's been incredible.

915
00:49:52,047 --> 00:49:55,960
And whatever happens between us,
you've made me a better cheerleader.

916
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:58,965
-And for that, l owe you--
-You have some food in your teeth.

917
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:03,197
And your pecs are uneven.
Make sure you don't favour one side.

918
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:04,916
Always coaching.

919
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:07,400
God bless you!

920
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:10,725
Why can't l crack this?

921
00:50:10,887 --> 00:50:11,922
Damn it.

922
00:50:12,287 --> 00:50:13,561
So...

923
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:17,515
...how often did you see Dr. Rick
during the school year?

924
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:20,997
l don't know why he keeps calling
himself that. lt's kind of douchey.

925
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:23,397
Oh, no, no, no. lt's super cool.

926
00:50:24,247 --> 00:50:26,283
l can't believe he's my pre-fiancé.

927
00:50:26,447 --> 00:50:28,483
l remember when l was 7,
l decided...

928
00:50:28,647 --> 00:50:31,559
...that l was not gonna get married
until l was 34.

929
00:50:31,727 --> 00:50:35,720
-That's very specific.
-Oh, l had it all thought out.

930
00:50:35,887 --> 00:50:38,162
High school, college,
a year abroad in Greece...

931
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:41,239
...and because, don't laugh,
l always loved Greek salad.

932
00:50:41,407 --> 00:50:45,161
Tomatoes, cucumbers, feta.
No, that makes perfect sense.

933
00:50:45,327 --> 00:50:46,521
l know. lt's silly.

934
00:50:46,687 --> 00:50:48,439
l love that you had it
all planned out.

935
00:50:48,607 --> 00:50:51,758
-You know what John Lennon said.
-Not really. l'm not in my 50s.

936
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:52,962
l could ask my dad.

937
00:50:53,127 --> 00:50:55,721
" Life is what happens when
you're busy making other plans."

938
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:57,406
Yeah.

939
00:51:05,367 --> 00:51:07,119
Damn, this is heavy.

940
00:51:07,287 --> 00:51:09,517
Are you okay? You look hot.
Do you want some water?

941
00:51:09,687 --> 00:51:11,086
-Yeah, sure. Thanks.
-Here.

942
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:17,720
Did you say l looked hot?
l'm pretty sure that's what l heard.

943
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,447
-l heard you screaming like a girl.
-Oh, really?

944
00:51:20,607 --> 00:51:22,723
Oh, my God. Don't move.
There's a bee on you.

945
00:51:22,887 --> 00:51:25,560
What? No. Get it off.

946
00:51:27,047 --> 00:51:28,446
You little bitch!

947
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:33,362
All right, week three of cheer camp,
here we come.

948
00:51:33,527 --> 00:51:35,438
l love the smell of pom-pom
in the morning.

949
00:51:35,607 --> 00:51:37,006
Let's do this.

950
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:40,123
-Where you going?
-Post-breakfast practise.

951
00:51:40,287 --> 00:51:43,643
And then, you know, Carly and l are
gonna work on reverse cartwheels.

952
00:51:43,807 --> 00:51:47,322
My left foot keeps hitching when
l do my inverse swing-over. lt's like:

953
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:49,762
Take it easy.
We're done with this, all right?

954
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:51,446
Week three. Hit it and quit it.

955
00:51:51,607 --> 00:51:54,201
Oh, no, we gotta--
We gotta stay longer.

956
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:56,961
Dude, it's time to go.
Remember Mookie's dad's house?

957
00:51:57,127 --> 00:51:58,480
The plasmas and the Jacuzzis.

958
00:51:58,647 --> 00:52:01,605
Yeah, but l just-- l think
we should stay just a touch longer.

959
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:03,644
l'm done. All right?
l've had enough girl.

960
00:52:03,807 --> 00:52:06,401
Breadsticks only keep you
at the Olive Garden for so long.

961
00:52:06,567 --> 00:52:07,841
Till, at some point, you say:

962
00:52:08,047 --> 00:52:10,242
"Why am l at Olive Garden
with these fat people?"

963
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:11,965
-What? No....
-Let's go.

964
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:14,766
-Let's talk about this.
-All right, let's go. Let's pack.

965
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:16,605
Let's just dialogue for a second.

966
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,076
-We don't have to go right now.
-Yeah, we do.

967
00:52:19,247 --> 00:52:21,807
The bus leaves in an hour.
Next one's not until tomorrow.

968
00:52:21,967 --> 00:52:24,356
Yeah, but come on, man.
What about our squad?

969
00:52:24,527 --> 00:52:26,245
You know,
the competition's coming up.

970
00:52:26,407 --> 00:52:29,046
Dude, the squad? The competition?
Listen to yourself.

971
00:52:29,207 --> 00:52:31,357
We had a deal. Two weeks. Right?

972
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:33,882
Kiss, kiss, bang, bang,
sayonara, cheer camp.

973
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:35,958
<i>We are</i> <i>leaving</i>
<i>We, we are</i> <i>leaving</i>

974
00:52:36,127 --> 00:52:37,116
<i>We are</i> <i>leaving</i>

975
00:52:37,447 --> 00:52:39,005
Now, come on, dude, start packing.

976
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:42,045
l need a little bit more time with Carly.
There. l said it. Okay?

977
00:52:42,207 --> 00:52:44,767
l know you think that's lame,
but can you give me one day?

978
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,282
That's not lame, bro. That's gay.

979
00:52:47,447 --> 00:52:50,803
Well, technically, pursuing a woman
you have heterosexual feelings for...

980
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:52,406
...that's not gay, Nick.

981
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:55,559
But using a rotating inverse
swing-over to do it? Yeah, that is.

982
00:52:55,727 --> 00:52:59,356
Shawn. Don't forget we're gonna
go over our reverse cartwheels.

983
00:52:59,527 --> 00:53:01,882
-Okay, I'll be right there.
-See you there.

984
00:53:02,047 --> 00:53:03,526
All right. Right behind him.

985
00:53:03,687 --> 00:53:06,565
All right, come on, man, let's go.
You know the deal.

986
00:53:07,047 --> 00:53:09,277
And trust me,
you're gonna thank me for this.

987
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:13,006
All right, let's go, Shawnzy.
And no more moping. All right?

988
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:15,635
Not an attractive colour on you,
nor is orange and grey.

989
00:53:15,807 --> 00:53:17,399
Takes away from your eyes.

990
00:53:25,487 --> 00:53:28,877
Damn it, damn it, damn it....

991
00:53:34,447 --> 00:53:35,482
What are you doing?

992
00:53:35,647 --> 00:53:37,956
Well, probably making
the biggest mistake of my life.

993
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:40,163
Except that year
l wore that leather wristband.

994
00:53:40,327 --> 00:53:43,558
How did l possibly think that's cool,
you know? l'm not a blacksmith.

995
00:53:43,727 --> 00:53:45,285
That was a little Nickelback-y.

996
00:53:45,447 --> 00:53:47,677
You like this girl,
you're my boy, we stay.

997
00:53:47,847 --> 00:53:49,519
Well, what about Mookie's house?

998
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:51,200
Are you coming or not?

999
00:53:52,247 --> 00:53:54,636
Are you sure we are staying?
We, we are staying?

1000
00:53:54,807 --> 00:53:57,401
No, l'm not sure,
so don't turn a yes into a no.

1001
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,523
Thank you, Nick.
Thank you so much, man.

1002
00:53:59,687 --> 00:54:01,598
l know you don't like
man-to-man touching...

1003
00:54:01,767 --> 00:54:05,157
...but my arm is on your shoulder.
Here comes my arm right now.

1004
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:07,204
<i>-Another day</i>
<i>-Another ho</i>/<i>ler</i>

1005
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:11,440
You're wasting my precious breath.
l can't hear you.

1006
00:54:11,607 --> 00:54:13,598
<i>-Another day</i>
<i>-Another ho</i>/<i>ler</i>

1007
00:54:13,767 --> 00:54:15,644

1008
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,796
<i>Another day</i>

1009
00:54:17,727 --> 00:54:19,285
Hey, bro, got a second?

1010
00:54:20,447 --> 00:54:21,846
Wrong section of the woods.

1011
00:54:22,047 --> 00:54:24,436
You want the northeast corner
near the redwoods.

1012
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:27,958
What? l wanna know if you know
two dudes named Nick and Shawn.

1013
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,246
Yeah. They're my bunkmates. Why?

1014
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:33,567
Five, six, seven, eight. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1015
00:54:33,567 --> 00:54:37,242
Five, six, seven, eight. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1016
00:54:39,047 --> 00:54:40,526
-Angela, no.
-Are you okay?

1017
00:54:40,687 --> 00:54:43,281
Easy, Tiger. Easy, Tiger.

1018
00:54:44,807 --> 00:54:48,356
-l'm fine. l'm fine, l'm fine.
-You all right?

1019
00:54:48,527 --> 00:54:49,596
l'm okay.

1020
00:54:51,447 --> 00:54:53,517
Sorry, guys, l just suck.

1021
00:54:53,687 --> 00:54:57,123
-lt's not just you. We all kind of suck.
-We're not good at all.

1022
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,799
-Hey, stop. Stop talking like that.
-But it's true.

1023
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:02,525
We're just not that good.

1024
00:55:03,327 --> 00:55:04,396
Stop.

1025
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,525
Enough of that.
You can go as far as you want.

1026
00:55:08,327 --> 00:55:10,363
What do the Panthers have
that you don't have?

1027
00:55:10,527 --> 00:55:11,642
-Skills.
-Athleticism.

1028
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:13,286
-Kickass cheers.
-Hair removal.

1029
00:55:13,447 --> 00:55:15,836
Big-ass titties. l'm just saying.

1030
00:55:16,007 --> 00:55:18,726
Confidence.
They're cocky assholes.

1031
00:55:18,887 --> 00:55:22,243
Like Nick, the cockiest asshole on the
football field. That's why he's good.

1032
00:55:22,407 --> 00:55:24,557
-l'm awesome.
-Because he believes in himself.

1033
00:55:24,727 --> 00:55:25,842
Also because l'm awesome.

1034
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:28,999
He knows he's gonna be good,
so he's good. And he takes chances.

1035
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:30,805
Due to the fact that l'm awesome.

1036
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:33,686
-Nick. Trying to make a speech here.
-l'm sorry.

1037
00:55:33,847 --> 00:55:36,361
Either bet big or go home.

1038
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:39,798
lf you don't wanna take any chances,
then you shouldn't even be here.

1039
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:43,283
l know you wanna be here, because
you finish last every single year...

1040
00:55:43,447 --> 00:55:45,005
...but you keep coming back...

1041
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:47,237
...even if it means
taking endless shit...

1042
00:55:47,407 --> 00:55:49,841
...from total dong-knockers
like the Panthers.

1043
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,526
l wanna cut the blond one.

1044
00:55:51,687 --> 00:55:52,881
-What?
-What?

1045
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:54,560
-What?
-What?

1046
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:57,400
-What?
-l'm just saying.

1047
00:55:58,127 --> 00:56:00,322
Come on, guys.
Let's be cocky assholes.

1048
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:01,840
He's right.

1049
00:56:02,007 --> 00:56:02,996
And l can say that...

1050
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:06,682
...because l am the best cheerleader
here, so you can all suck my dick.

1051
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,005
l was just being a cocky asshole.

1052
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:14,637
Oh, nice. Did you see
what she was doing there?

1053
00:56:14,807 --> 00:56:17,162
That's exactly what l want
from everybody.

1054
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:18,885
All right, let's do this.

1055
00:56:19,047 --> 00:56:22,357
And remember, you're awesome.
Let's risk it to get the biscuit.

1056
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,926
All right, get cocky, bitches.

1057
00:56:27,127 --> 00:56:29,197
Let's do it. Come on, guys. Ready.

1058

All right, get cocky.

Here we go, here we go.

00:57:12,247 --> 00:57:13,521
Everybody, let's work.

There it is.

1074
00:57:28,167 --> 00:57:29,566
Go big, Shawnzy.

1075
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,641
l'm doing it, brother.

1076
00:57:35,727 --> 00:57:38,082
Awesome. So much better.

1077
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:47,556
<i>Tigers!</i>

1078
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:51,758
All right, <i>la tigres</i>. Come on.

1079
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:54,037
That's my girls,
bringing some A-game.

1080
00:57:54,727 --> 00:57:56,206
You are some cocky bitches.

1081
00:57:56,367 --> 00:57:59,564
l think it's safe to say that you guys
are now officially Tigers.

1082
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:01,558
-Right, girls?
-All right.

1083
00:58:01,727 --> 00:58:03,126
One, two, three.

1084
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:04,606
Tigers!

1085
00:58:05,087 --> 00:58:07,476
One, two, three, frauds!

1086
00:58:07,887 --> 00:58:10,321
-Rick?
-These two have been playing you.

1087
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,603
They didn't come
because they like cheerleading.

1088
00:58:12,767 --> 00:58:14,883
They came here because
they like cheerleaders.

1089
00:58:15,047 --> 00:58:17,242
-Yeah, we know.
-Everyone knows.

1090
00:58:17,407 --> 00:58:19,204
Why are you here?
What's going on, Rick?

1091
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:22,120
-Bus tickets.
-Damn it.

1092
00:58:22,287 --> 00:58:25,199
Your friends were planning on leaving
before the competition...

1093
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:28,325
...without any feeling for anyone
they may have left in their wake.

1094
00:58:28,487 --> 00:58:29,886
-Animals.
-You were gonna leave?

1095
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:33,244
Well, we were gonna, but we didn't.
That's way before you and l ever--

1096
00:58:33,407 --> 00:58:35,967
-You were gonna do this to the squad?
-l can explain.

1097
00:58:36,127 --> 00:58:39,722
l can't believe you. l mean,
l knew you were here to get girls, but...

1098
00:58:39,887 --> 00:58:42,082
-...l thought you started to get into it.
-l did.

1099
00:58:42,247 --> 00:58:45,319
lt started off being about girls,
but then it became about you.

1100
00:58:45,487 --> 00:58:48,206
-Wait, that doesn't sound right.
-That sounds exactly right.

1101
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:49,846
Bail, brother. Bail.

1102
00:58:50,047 --> 00:58:51,605
l really like you, Carly.

1103
00:58:51,767 --> 00:58:53,086
That's close enough, dicklick.

1104
00:58:53,247 --> 00:58:57,081
This is how you show someone you
like them, Shawn? By lying to them?

1105
00:58:57,247 --> 00:58:59,966
To be fair, he lied to you
before he really cared...

1106
00:59:00,127 --> 00:59:03,437
...then he tried super hard to word it
so it wouldn't be a lie after that.

1107
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:05,120
Just so we're on the same page.

1108
00:59:06,047 --> 00:59:08,925
lf these weren't tools for healing,
l would crack you in the jaw.

1109
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,918
-You're a tool for healing.
-That's right.

1110
00:59:11,087 --> 00:59:12,918
You're the guy
who's fancy with his words.

1111
00:59:13,087 --> 00:59:15,601
Well, then, why don't
l just read your diary?

1112
00:59:15,767 --> 00:59:18,520
-Where did you get that?
-l've done a bad thing. l'm so sorry.

1113
00:59:18,687 --> 00:59:21,485
l'm sorry. l'm a sorry Suzy
right now. He tricked me.

1114
00:59:21,647 --> 00:59:23,080
You tricked me.

1115
00:59:23,247 --> 00:59:24,600
This is how it happened.

1116
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:26,356
Brewster!

1117
00:59:26,527 --> 00:59:29,405
He said he wanted to leave you a note,
l brought him to the bunk.

1118
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:31,319
He must've seen
your stuff on the couch.

1119
00:59:31,487 --> 00:59:33,955
-Why was it on the couch?
-l was cleaning up your mess.

1120
00:59:34,127 --> 00:59:36,163
l told you l can't stand clutter.
l warned you.

1121
00:59:36,327 --> 00:59:39,637
-Give me the book back.
-" Cheer camp, day one.

1122
00:59:40,527 --> 00:59:43,599
The sun rises in the summer sky...

1123
00:59:43,767 --> 00:59:46,759
...like Rembrandt's brush
on a dogwood branch."

1124
00:59:47,527 --> 00:59:49,882
-Queeratron.
-Let's go. Give it to me.

1125
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:53,076
Back up, Abercrombie & Bitch.

1126
00:59:54,847 --> 00:59:56,565
"And thereby Diora--"

1127
01:00:01,087 --> 01:00:04,921
" l lie awake thinking, will l ever say
'Diora,' as a whisper in an ear?

1128
01:00:05,087 --> 01:00:07,760
Will she ever say " l love you,"
in a moment with a tear?"

1129
01:00:07,927 --> 01:00:10,487
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1130
01:00:12,287 --> 01:00:14,517
Carly, l'm really sorry.
l didn't mean to hurt you.

1131
01:00:14,687 --> 01:00:18,202
Just leave, okay? Just leave
like you always planned on doing.

1132
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:21,086
Carly, please, let me explain.
Give me just one second.

1133
01:00:21,247 --> 01:00:22,999
See you later, high school.

1134
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,886
l didn't write that. l bought the book.
lt was in there.

1135
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:27,321
lt was beautiful.

1136
01:00:28,127 --> 01:00:29,321
Thanks.

1137
01:00:32,607 --> 01:00:34,484
Never really thought of that one.

1138
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:38,003
Using one's true feelings
to wrangle snooch.

1139
01:00:39,007 --> 01:00:40,440
So simple.

1140
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:57,240
So we lied and we got caught.
So what, huh?

1141
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:59,079
We're humans. Humans lie.

1142
01:00:59,247 --> 01:01:02,523
They tell big gigantic two-week-long
lies because they're humans.

1143
01:01:02,687 --> 01:01:05,326
Stop saying " humans." We did this.

1144
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:07,045
Because we're humans.

1145
01:01:07,207 --> 01:01:10,040
All right, humans are
the only species that can lie.

1146
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,722
Except for maybe chameleons.

1147
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:15,716
And possums. They play dead.

1148
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:20,122
What's that?

1149
01:01:20,287 --> 01:01:23,324
lt's Downey's bracelet.
Yeah, l love that kid, huh?

1150
01:01:23,487 --> 01:01:25,717
Said it was cool, so he gave it to me.
How nice.

1151
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,845
Those are his...beads, bro.

1152
01:01:29,007 --> 01:01:31,157
Downey liked you.
Like, " liked you" liked you.

1153
01:01:31,327 --> 01:01:33,887
What? That's crazy.
Downey isn't gay.

1154
01:01:34,047 --> 01:01:36,845
Nick, come on. Think about it.

1155
01:01:37,367 --> 01:01:39,039
l'm Nick. This is Shawn.

1156
01:01:39,207 --> 01:01:42,040
-What's up? l'm Downey.
-Hey. Nice to meet you.

1157
01:01:42,207 --> 01:01:45,677
Put it in there.
A little cheer camp. Crazy good times.

1158
01:01:45,847 --> 01:01:47,121
Yeah. lt's gonna be fun.

1159
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,596
<i>Panther meat!</i>
<i>l said, hey, Tigers!</i>

1160
01:01:49,767 --> 01:01:51,803
<i>-Yeah?</i>
<i>-Hey, Tigers!</i>

1161
01:01:52,927 --> 01:01:53,996
Diora.

1162
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:56,044
Hey, Nick.
You wanna go out on the field...

1163
01:01:56,207 --> 01:01:58,163
...and maybe count shooting stars
with me?

1164
01:01:58,327 --> 01:02:00,557
You're classic, Downey. Classic.

1165
01:02:07,407 --> 01:02:09,079
Raw-hamburger fight!

1166
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:24,361
l'm hit.

1167
01:02:25,847 --> 01:02:29,078
Medic!
This man needs some jocks-ygen.

1168
01:02:29,727 --> 01:02:31,683
Come on, we're losing him.

1169
01:02:31,847 --> 01:02:36,159
Don't you die on me. Don't die on me.
Don't you die on me.

1170
01:02:36,447 --> 01:02:38,722
<i>You prance around</i> <i>lik e</i> <i>litt</i><i>le toys</i>

<i>You can mak e some noise?</i>

1172
01:02:41,327 --> 01:02:43,079
Five, six, seven, eight.

1173
01:02:43,247 --> 01:02:45,078
<i>Tigers!</i>

1174
01:02:49,567 --> 01:02:52,127
Welcome back to Sucktown.
Population: you.

1175
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:56,326
Without your gigolos, looks like
you got last place sewn up, again.

1176
01:02:56,487 --> 01:02:59,559
Why don't you get your nose job
out of everybody else's business.

1177
01:02:59,727 --> 01:03:00,876
l got thrown by a horse.

1178
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:03,561
Why? Was he spooked because
you both have the same face?

1179
01:03:03,727 --> 01:03:05,399
You're gonna die. You're gonna die.

1180
01:03:05,567 --> 01:03:06,716
Carly, don't.

1181
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:10,675
You're placing your anger at the boys
on them. lt's transference.

1182
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:13,077
You're right.
l'm gonna punch you in the throat!

1183
01:03:13,327 --> 01:03:14,316
Let it go.

1184
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:21,042
Look at that little hottie. Wonder
what she wants to do with her life.

1185
01:03:21,407 --> 01:03:22,396
What?

1186
01:03:22,567 --> 01:03:25,035
You know how Bianca
wants to go to cooking school...

1187
01:03:25,247 --> 01:03:27,477
...and Sylvia wants to be a pilot,
and... .

1188
01:03:27,647 --> 01:03:28,636
Oh, my God.

1189
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:32,205
l actually know these girls,
as, like, friends.

1190
01:03:32,367 --> 01:03:33,720
And l care.

1191
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,684
l'm becoming
like a fully formed person...

1192
01:03:35,847 --> 01:03:37,724
...with like sensitivity and empathy.

1193
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:40,638
All right, l'm a person!

1194
01:03:40,807 --> 01:03:43,799
Look at the pooper on that one.
l could rest my beer on that shit.

1195
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:46,640
And you're back. What kind of
dressing goes on a Greek salad?

1196
01:03:46,807 --> 01:03:48,445
Olive oil, top shelf.

1197
01:03:55,567 --> 01:03:59,242
ls it me, Shawnzy, or is this not nearly
as much fun as it was last year?

1198
01:03:59,407 --> 01:04:00,396
lt's not you.

1199
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:02,523
This is too high. Give me a boost.

1200
01:04:05,327 --> 01:04:06,362
Shoulder stand.

1201
01:04:06,527 --> 01:04:07,926
-Ready?
-Okay.

1202
01:04:08,487 --> 01:04:10,796
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1203
01:04:10,967 --> 01:04:12,958
-Grab.
-Out, drop, catch, dismount.

1204
01:04:13,847 --> 01:04:15,644
Catch. Yeah, buddy.

1205
01:04:15,807 --> 01:04:17,126
Guys?

1206
01:04:17,927 --> 01:04:19,360
Don't take this the wrong way...

1207
01:04:19,527 --> 01:04:21,882
...but l think there's someone
you should talk to.

1208
01:04:22,607 --> 01:04:25,167
Hello, l'm am Reginald
von Belly Button.

1209
01:04:25,327 --> 01:04:27,602
l love Twinkies.

1210
01:04:38,043 --> 01:04:40,796
The competition's tomorrow.
l wonder if we could win it.

1211
01:04:41,723 --> 01:04:43,441
Did you say
" l wonder if we could win"?

1212
01:04:43,603 --> 01:04:44,877
-No.
-Yes, you did.

1213
01:04:45,043 --> 01:04:46,715
-You totally did.
-Didn't.

1214
01:04:46,923 --> 01:04:49,073
You wanna go back.
You're into cheering.

1215
01:04:49,243 --> 01:04:52,758
l'm the captain of the football team.
l could give a rat's ass about cheering.

1216
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:55,278
-You're a cheerleader.
-You're misquoting me.

1217
01:04:55,443 --> 01:04:56,432
Do you wanna go back?

1218
01:04:56,603 --> 01:04:59,561
For you. Because l can't stand
seeing my best friend in Frown Town.

1219
01:04:59,723 --> 01:05:00,872
That's how selfless l am.

1220
01:05:01,043 --> 01:05:03,682
l would sacrifice myself
to cheer you up. l'm like Gandhi.

1221
01:05:03,843 --> 01:05:06,152
-Gandhi?
-Gandhi!

1222
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:09,360
-Mahatma K. Gandhi.
-Quake'n Bake!

1223
01:05:11,763 --> 01:05:13,833
Bus leaves in 20 minutes.

1224
01:05:15,483 --> 01:05:18,680
lf we extend our high V's, we have
a chance at landing that aerial.

1225
01:05:18,843 --> 01:05:20,959
l don't know who you are anymore.

1226
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:23,311
Kenny's asleep on the couch.

1227
01:05:23,483 --> 01:05:25,872
We're gonna get whipped cream
and paint his face.

1228
01:05:26,043 --> 01:05:27,681
-Come on.
-Be right there, dudes.

1229
01:05:27,843 --> 01:05:30,311
-Right behind you, bro.
-Oh, my horse is peeing.

1230
01:05:47,163 --> 01:05:48,721
What is that?

1231
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:50,995
Go back to sleep.

1232
01:05:55,323 --> 01:05:57,075
Why are you in my bed?

1233
01:05:57,243 --> 01:05:59,359
l must have sleepwalked.

1234
01:05:59,523 --> 01:06:02,037
l'm here now.
Let's just make the best of it.

1235
01:06:02,323 --> 01:06:04,678
Get out of my bed, Bianca.

1236
01:06:04,843 --> 01:06:07,960
-l kind of can't.
-Why?

1237
01:06:08,123 --> 01:06:09,954
l might not have pants on.

1238
01:06:12,523 --> 01:06:14,479
-What are you doing here?
-l came back.

1239
01:06:14,643 --> 01:06:17,715
-l can see that. Goodbye.
-Carly, just listen to me.

1240
01:06:17,883 --> 01:06:19,236
-Why?
-We're teammates.

1241
01:06:19,403 --> 01:06:21,712
Teammates don't join a team
under false pretences...

1242
01:06:21,883 --> 01:06:23,794
...then leave once they
get what they want.

1243
01:06:23,963 --> 01:06:26,636
l know you're pissed at me,
and you should be. l lied to you.

1244
01:06:26,803 --> 01:06:30,716
But this is about the squad. We all
worked way too hard to throw it away.

1245
01:06:30,883 --> 01:06:32,635
How are you standing in the air?

1246
01:06:32,803 --> 01:06:34,998
Just take us back already. Christ!

1247
01:06:35,163 --> 01:06:36,676
Nick. Carly...

1248
01:06:36,843 --> 01:06:38,834
...l like you,
but that's not why l'm here.

1249
01:06:39,003 --> 01:06:40,322
Oh, rock me, sexy Jesus.

1250
01:06:40,483 --> 01:06:41,882
-Why are you here?
-Honestly?

1251
01:06:42,043 --> 01:06:44,921
-No. Lie to me again.
-Shawnzy, make it quick, buddy.

1252
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:47,677
-Buddy.
-l like cheering.

1253
01:06:49,483 --> 01:06:50,552
Fraggle Rock.

1254
01:06:50,723 --> 01:06:51,792
l'm sorry, man.

1255
01:06:52,203 --> 01:06:53,192
My pecs are sore.

1256
01:06:53,363 --> 01:06:56,912
Oh, my God, Diora's right.
My left side is weaker.

1257
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:59,233
-l favour one side.
-Pull me up. Pull me up.

1258
01:06:59,403 --> 01:07:01,758
ls this your plan
to get a little face time with me?

1259
01:07:01,923 --> 01:07:04,483
No. l'm dying here, seriously.

1260
01:07:05,323 --> 01:07:08,679
-Carly, come on. We need them.
-l don't wanna come in last again.

1261
01:07:10,603 --> 01:07:12,912
Fine. But l'm only doing this
for the squad.

1262
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,402
You got it.

1263
01:07:16,883 --> 01:07:19,113
-Bianca?
-Yeah.

1264
01:07:19,283 --> 01:07:22,639
Any chance you could throw on
a pair of underpants?

1265
01:07:23,963 --> 01:07:27,035
lt's competition day today.
Competition.

1266
01:07:34,123 --> 01:07:36,193
-Wow, this is big-time.
-Yeah, it is.

1267
01:07:36,363 --> 01:07:39,321
Well, well, well, if it isn't a couple
of wolves in cheer clothing.

1268
01:07:39,483 --> 01:07:42,520
Which part of " next time l see
your punim they'll be on the moon" ...

1269
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:45,561
-...didn't you understand?
-Like, the whole thing?

1270
01:07:45,723 --> 01:07:48,283
l'm gonna have to go ahead
and ask you both to go ahead...

1271
01:07:48,443 --> 01:07:50,673
...and leave right now to leave now.

1272
01:07:50,843 --> 01:07:52,754
lt's all right.
l told them they could stay.

1273
01:07:52,923 --> 01:07:55,801
You really want these strong-jawed
philanderers on your squad?

1274
01:07:55,963 --> 01:07:56,952
Yeah.

1275
01:07:57,603 --> 01:07:59,992
lt was just a little misunderstanding
we had before.

1276
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:01,232
All right. Your choice.

1277
01:08:01,403 --> 01:08:05,032
Next time you screw up,
l'm gonna have both your asses.

1278
01:08:05,483 --> 01:08:06,472
That's frightening.

1279
01:08:06,643 --> 01:08:08,599
Let's move it along.
Giddyup and roar.

1280
01:08:08,763 --> 01:08:10,993
Let me see those claws.
Move it along.

1281
01:08:11,163 --> 01:08:15,873
Meet me on Taryn Field tonight
after the competition. Bring your diary.

1282
01:08:16,283 --> 01:08:18,160
Only if you bring the dance
in your step...

1283
01:08:18,323 --> 01:08:21,395
...like a shimmering nymph
travelling the back of the wind.

1284
01:08:24,483 --> 01:08:27,361
Good afternoon, and welcome
to Channel 29's coverage...

1285
01:08:27,523 --> 01:08:30,560
...of the Regional Southeastern
lllinois Cheerleading Competition.

1286
01:08:56,963 --> 01:09:00,797
Bend at the hips and reach through
your hands. Don't lock--

1287
01:09:00,963 --> 01:09:04,558
God, please give us the strength to
land our flip-flops and basket tosses.

1288
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:06,475
Amen. Oh, and fix the economy.

1289
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:09,157
-Red leather, yellow leather.
-Red leather, yellow leather.

1290
01:09:09,323 --> 01:09:11,678
-Unique New York.
-Unique New York.

1291
01:09:11,883 --> 01:09:14,841
-Barack, Barack, Barack Obama.
-Barack, Barack, Barack Obama.

1292
01:09:15,003 --> 01:09:20,680
Five, six, seven, eight.
Kill, Panthers, kill. Panthers, kill....

1293
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:27,041
-Shawn.
-Carly.

1294
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:30,162
-What you did really hurt me.
-l know, l know. l know.

1295
01:09:30,323 --> 01:09:34,874
l want you to know why. lt's just
l thought you and l got really close...

1296
01:09:35,043 --> 01:09:36,192
...and l trusted you.

1297
01:09:36,363 --> 01:09:38,513
l know.
l felt the same way about you.

1298
01:09:39,403 --> 01:09:43,442
l'm really sorry, Carly.
And l don't expect you to forgive me.

1299
01:09:43,603 --> 01:09:45,002
l want you to know l'm sorry.

1300
01:09:45,603 --> 01:09:47,912
There's my Carly Davidson!

1301
01:09:51,363 --> 01:09:52,637
Hi, Rick.

1302
01:09:54,763 --> 01:09:58,358
-Just came by to say break a leg.
-That's theatre. This is cheering.

1303
01:09:58,523 --> 01:09:59,956
You better believe it.

1304
01:10:00,123 --> 01:10:02,683
-What's up, Dick?
-lt's Rick. Dr. Rick.

1305
01:10:03,523 --> 01:10:06,515
God, l keep doing that.
You just look like such a Dick to me.

1306
01:10:06,683 --> 01:10:08,514
What are you crunt-sacks
doing back here?

1307
01:10:08,683 --> 01:10:11,436
lt's okay. They're just helping us
do our final routine.

1308
01:10:11,603 --> 01:10:12,831
I'll be watching you.

1309
01:10:13,003 --> 01:10:16,678
Yeah. That's exactly what an audience
member does at a performance event.

1310
01:10:16,883 --> 01:10:18,282
Just go sit down, Rick.

1311
01:10:20,323 --> 01:10:23,474
Robert De Niro,
<i>Meet the Parents</i> reference. Love it.

1312
01:10:24,683 --> 01:10:26,639
-God, he seems great.
-Really nice.

1313
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:27,792
l like him.

1314
01:10:37,043 --> 01:10:38,112
Here you go. Look alive.

1315
01:10:38,283 --> 01:10:40,035
Coming at you.
Here you go. Look alive.

1316
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:43,001
Coming at you. Here you go,
freak shows. New uniforms.

1317
01:10:43,723 --> 01:10:46,032
-Here you go. Look alive.
-We didn't order these.

1318
01:10:46,203 --> 01:10:48,239
No shit, lesbatron. My brother did.

1319
01:10:48,403 --> 01:10:50,473
We're a new squad.
We need new uniforms.

1320
01:10:50,643 --> 01:10:53,521
-Thank you, Shawn.
-Awesome. Thank you.

1321
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:56,641
-Okay. You owe me 1 27.80.
-You said it was gonna be 200.

1322
01:10:56,803 --> 01:10:59,112
-l cut you a deal.
-Wow, Poppy. Thank you.

1323
01:10:59,283 --> 01:11:01,035
That's actually human of you.

1324
01:11:01,203 --> 01:11:03,273
Don't get all ABC Family
on me here, buddy.

1325
01:11:03,443 --> 01:11:04,558
You're doing me a favour.

1326
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:08,113
l guaranteed Staples 45 seconds
of airtime, so cheat out to camera.

1327
01:11:08,283 --> 01:11:10,080
And work this into your cheer:

1328
01:11:10,243 --> 01:11:12,632
"Staples now carries 30-percent
recycled copy paper.

1329
01:11:12,803 --> 01:11:15,271
Staples, committed to the
environment, committed to you."

1330
01:11:15,443 --> 01:11:16,432
-Hey.
-Okay.

1331
01:11:16,603 --> 01:11:18,912
lf l don't have the money,
it's my shoe in your ass.

1332
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:21,916
-That seems fair.
-You look great. Are you in love?

1333
01:11:24,803 --> 01:11:25,838
Stay safe.

1334
01:11:28,643 --> 01:11:29,632
What's up, kid?

1335
01:11:29,803 --> 01:11:31,202
-Downey.
-Good to have you back.

1336
01:11:31,363 --> 01:11:34,912
Why didn't you tell me you're gay?
l'd have been totally okay with that.

1337
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:38,792
-Paint with all the colours of the wind.
-Wait. You're straight?

1338
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:43,438
Am l straight? Yes.

1339
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:44,922
But what about your diary?

1340
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:47,756
Then you asked for my beads
and stuck them in your mouth--

1341
01:11:47,923 --> 01:11:50,483
-l thought it was a bracelet.
-A bracelet in your mouth?

1342
01:11:50,643 --> 01:11:52,122
-l don't know.
-The closet door...

1343
01:11:52,283 --> 01:11:54,080
...is made of all kinds of wood,
brother.

1344
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:55,676
What?

1345
01:11:57,683 --> 01:11:59,036
-All kinds.
-Okay.

1346
01:12:00,163 --> 01:12:02,677
God, that is so awkward.

1347
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:09,872
The Panthers, clear favourites,
have really come to play today.

1348
01:12:37,283 --> 01:12:40,673
<i>Fierce, brave, hungry, Panthers</i>

1349
01:12:40,843 --> 01:12:41,878
<i>Ki</i>/<i>l!</i>

1350
01:12:52,003 --> 01:12:54,471
-Dude, they're kind of great.
-Yeah.

1351
01:12:54,643 --> 01:12:56,156
lt's not about them, guys.

1352
01:12:56,323 --> 01:12:59,520
lt's about us. Just stay focused.
We'll be fine.

1353
01:12:59,683 --> 01:13:00,672
Panthers out.

1354
01:13:08,883 --> 01:13:10,236
Oh, let me get that for you.

1355
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:16,072
Drool much?

1356
01:13:17,163 --> 01:13:18,835
Panthers out.

1357
01:13:30,003 --> 01:13:33,916
Free paper, courtesy of Staples.
30-percent recycled copy paper.

1358
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:36,677
Staples, committed to the
environment, committed to you.

1359
01:13:36,883 --> 01:13:38,680
Do you have
50-percent recycled paper?

1360
01:13:38,843 --> 01:13:42,472
No. But l have 50-percent recycled
asshole paper. lt's in the men's room.

1361
01:13:42,643 --> 01:13:44,873
lt's free, gay bar, just take it.

1362
01:13:45,043 --> 01:13:46,442
Let's do this.

1363
01:13:46,603 --> 01:13:47,283
-Tigers!
-Let's go. Let's go.

1364
01:13:47,283 --> 01:13:48,716
-Tigers!
-Let's go. Let's go.

1365
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:52,319
Now, the Tigers from Gerald R. Ford
High School in Hinsdale, lllinois.

1366
01:13:52,923 --> 01:13:55,801
This team historically ranks last
like their namesake president.

1367
01:13:55,963 --> 01:13:58,158
Let's see if they've
stepped it up this year.

1368
01:13:58,323 --> 01:14:00,996
Hey. ls this on TV?
Dude, this can't be on TV.

1369
01:14:01,163 --> 01:14:04,360
Don't worry. lt's NBC. No one
watches network television anymore.

1370
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,559
Look, it's Nick on TV, cheerleading.

1371
01:14:07,163 --> 01:14:09,233
Shawn too. They're cheerleaders.

1372
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,871
l thought those dudes
were in the kitchen.

1373
01:14:12,683 --> 01:14:15,993
<i>A</i>// <i>you chumps think you got poise</i>
<i>You prance around</i> <i>lik e</i> <i>litt</i><i>le toys</i>

1374
01:14:16,163 --> 01:14:17,391
Shit.

1375
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:19,311
My chickens.

1376
01:14:19,483 --> 01:14:21,201
Five, six, seven, eight.

1377
01:14:21,363 --> 01:14:22,842
<i>Tigers!</i>

1378
01:14:43,643 --> 01:14:46,760
Risky floor stunts, athletic tumbling,
tight formations.

1379
01:14:46,923 --> 01:14:49,995
Looks like the addition of those
two new guys is really paying off.

1380
01:14:53,883 --> 01:14:55,077
Oh, my God, that bitch.

1381
01:14:57,163 --> 01:15:00,235
-lt's not totally her fault.
-l was talking about Dr. Dick.

1382
01:15:00,403 --> 01:15:02,758
lt sucks. Don't let it distract you.
We're gonna win.

1383
01:15:02,923 --> 01:15:05,153
No, we're not.
We're not as good as the others.

1384
01:15:05,323 --> 01:15:07,553
Yeah, we are. And there's
one way we can prove it.

1385
01:15:11,563 --> 01:15:13,394
-The Fountain of Troy.
-Yeah, right.

1386
01:15:13,563 --> 01:15:16,123
l thought that move
was prohibidimibidibabido.

1387
01:15:25,203 --> 01:15:26,192
Remember Lennon?

1388
01:15:26,363 --> 01:15:28,752
" Life's what happens when
you're busy making other plans."

1389
01:15:28,923 --> 01:15:31,721
-This is it. Life's happening.
-lt's not that easy, Shawn.

1390
01:15:31,883 --> 01:15:35,717
l never said it was. You can do it.
l know you can. I'll jump it with you.

1391
01:15:35,883 --> 01:15:38,192
l still just don't see them
qualifying for States.

1392
01:15:38,363 --> 01:15:41,321
They are just not in the same league
as the top teams here.

1393
01:15:42,843 --> 01:15:44,561
-Who's gonna catch me?
-Nick.

1394
01:15:44,723 --> 01:15:47,999
-Who's gonna catch you?
-Them.

1395
01:15:48,163 --> 01:15:50,597
l have total faith in them.
They're Tigers.

1396
01:15:50,763 --> 01:15:52,958
-But what if they don't?
-Bet big or go home.

1397
01:15:53,123 --> 01:15:55,034
You gotta risk it to get the biscuit.

1398
01:16:01,803 --> 01:16:03,122
-We're doing it.
-You sure?

1399
01:16:03,283 --> 01:16:04,682
We're doing a lot of talking.

1400
01:16:04,843 --> 01:16:07,152
This seems like a lot
of talking during the routine.

1401
01:16:09,963 --> 01:16:11,555
Lot of talking during the routine.

1402
01:16:13,163 --> 01:16:15,279
l'm the fountain.
Shawn, base. Nick, back.

1403
01:16:15,443 --> 01:16:17,877
Girls, catch. Shawn,
double-back handspring to end it.

1404
01:16:18,043 --> 01:16:19,032
-Got it.
-Ready?

1405
01:16:19,203 --> 01:16:20,636
Break.

1406
01:16:28,363 --> 01:16:31,673
ls this what l think it is? Are the Tigers
trying the Fountain of Troy?

1407
01:16:32,523 --> 01:16:36,072
This is the most dangerous move
in cheerleading. OMG.

1408
01:16:36,283 --> 01:16:37,716
That's prohibidado.

1409
01:16:38,363 --> 01:16:41,275
l told them in Spanish. How much
clearer could l have been?

1410
01:16:42,123 --> 01:16:43,192
Here comes the build.

1411
01:16:44,443 --> 01:16:45,432
Nice.

1412
01:16:47,763 --> 01:16:49,799
An awesome flying pose.

1413
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:57,633
Here it comes, the final fountain.

1414
01:17:02,523 --> 01:17:04,036
And now for the final dismount.

1415
01:17:04,683 --> 01:17:05,911
Yes.

1416
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:08,641
Perfect.

1417
01:17:09,203 --> 01:17:10,318
And the final flip out.

1418
01:17:10,843 --> 01:17:12,162
Here it comes, and....

1419
01:17:12,763 --> 01:17:14,196
<i>Tigers!</i>

1420
01:17:25,363 --> 01:17:26,682
Shawn!

1421
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:37,072
Tigers!

1422
01:17:43,363 --> 01:17:44,876
That little shit.

1423
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:46,516
My chicken shit.

1424
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:50,952
Shawnzy. No, come here.
Come here, buddy. God.

1425
01:17:55,723 --> 01:17:56,712
Hey.

1426
01:17:58,083 --> 01:17:59,072
Hey.

1427
01:18:00,283 --> 01:18:02,080
Did we win?
Are we going to States?

1428
01:18:02,243 --> 01:18:03,801
No, we came in 1 9th.

1429
01:18:05,243 --> 01:18:06,232
l'm sorry.

1430
01:18:06,403 --> 01:18:09,281
Are you kidding? That's 1 0 places
better than we did last year.

1431
01:18:09,443 --> 01:18:11,957
lf they didn't deduct points
for the Fountain of Troy...

1432
01:18:12,123 --> 01:18:13,442
...we might've made top three.

1433
01:18:14,003 --> 01:18:15,834
You nailed your triple backflip.

1434
01:18:16,003 --> 01:18:17,641
l nailed my double backflip...

1435
01:18:17,803 --> 01:18:21,318
...because a triple backflip
would've landed me in the water.

1436
01:18:22,163 --> 01:18:24,597
Yeah, l did do three.
That makes more sense.

1437
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:41,035
-What was that?
-About three weeks overdue.

1438
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:53,235
What the hell are you doing?

1439
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:56,402
Kissing my teammate.

1440
01:18:56,603 --> 01:19:00,596
You wanna die today? l can take life
just as fast as l can give it.

1441
01:19:00,763 --> 01:19:02,321
First of all, you're not a doctor.

1442
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:04,880
Second of all,
you're not my boyfriend.

1443
01:19:05,043 --> 01:19:06,795
What? Carly Fries, come on.

1444
01:19:07,723 --> 01:19:10,112
You're dumping me for him?

1445
01:19:10,523 --> 01:19:11,842
No, l'm dumping you, period.

1446
01:19:12,003 --> 01:19:16,758
And then l'm gonna be with him,
period. lf that's okay with him.

1447
01:19:18,203 --> 01:19:19,318
Question mark.

1448
01:19:19,523 --> 01:19:22,037
Totally. Exclamation point.

1449
01:19:22,443 --> 01:19:25,480
Oh, puke.
Parentheses, bold, underline.

1450
01:19:26,603 --> 01:19:31,313
Carly Horse. Carly's Jr. baby.
Larry, Moe and Carly.

1451
01:19:32,243 --> 01:19:34,757
Carly and the Chocolate Factory,
sugar.

1452
01:19:36,403 --> 01:19:38,837
Carlsbad, Carly-fornia.

1453
01:19:39,643 --> 01:19:41,440
Why don't you run along now?

1454
01:19:41,603 --> 01:19:43,559
The longer you watch,
the sadder it gets.

1455
01:19:43,723 --> 01:19:45,679
-I'll show you sad.
-Hey, buddy.

1456
01:19:45,843 --> 01:19:46,992
Oh, Jesus.

1457
01:19:47,163 --> 01:19:48,232
-Nick.
-Nick.

1458
01:19:51,003 --> 01:19:52,277
That was for the Crocs.

1459
01:19:52,443 --> 01:19:55,003
You're not an old lady gardening
or a baby on the beach.

1460
01:19:55,163 --> 01:19:58,439
Okay? Now put on some shoes,
you're embarrassing yourself.

1461
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:02,515
l'm just saying.

1462
01:20:02,683 --> 01:20:05,516
-You okay?
-Nothing a kiss can't fix.

1463
01:20:05,683 --> 01:20:07,241
Wait till tonight.

1464
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:11,961
l'm gonna make a wish on these
and throw them into the sky.

1465
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:17,357
l hope one of you ends up
in my ER one day, bleeding...

1466
01:20:17,523 --> 01:20:19,798
...I'll make you wait for days.

1467
01:20:20,043 --> 01:20:22,762
Unless one of you has Blue Cross...

1468
01:20:23,323 --> 01:20:26,281
...that's a PPO,
none of that HMO bullshit!

1469
01:20:30,483 --> 01:20:32,041
This is so cute.

1470
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:35,798
The 1 9th-placers.
You're like the littlest pigs.

1471
01:20:38,123 --> 01:20:41,274
-How does it feel to still suck ass?
-You tell me.

1472
01:20:44,723 --> 01:20:48,318
Please don't hurt us. l was just kidding
about the whole rivalry thing.

1473
01:20:48,483 --> 01:20:51,395
Cheering doesn't mean that much
to me. l wanna be a paralegal.

1474
01:20:51,563 --> 01:20:53,440
l love your hair. Go.
That bitch is crazy.

1475
01:20:53,603 --> 01:20:57,039
Way to go, Bianca.
l didn't know you had it in you.

1476
01:20:57,203 --> 01:20:59,398
There's a lot you don't know
about her.

1477
01:21:00,163 --> 01:21:03,200
You know that John Lennon
" life happening" ...

1478
01:21:03,363 --> 01:21:06,719
..." risk it to get the biscuit"
stuff you said back there?

1479
01:21:06,883 --> 01:21:08,157
lt didn't really make sense.

1480
01:21:08,323 --> 01:21:09,961
Well, it got you to do it.

1481
01:21:10,123 --> 01:21:12,637
No. You got me to do it.

1482
01:21:20,323 --> 01:21:23,713
Well, congratulations, kid.
You got what you wanted.

1483
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:26,472
Thanks to you.
l couldn't have done it without you.

1484
01:21:26,643 --> 01:21:29,316
-Just shut up. Shut up.
-ls it hard for you to accept thanks?

1485
01:21:29,483 --> 01:21:31,792
-You want me to accept thanks?
-Yeah. Open up to me.

1486
01:21:31,963 --> 01:21:34,431
Here it comes from my mouth.
And you're welcome.

1487
01:21:36,443 --> 01:21:37,671
Diora.

1488
01:21:37,843 --> 01:21:39,595
Lose the clothes.

1489
01:21:43,123 --> 01:21:44,761
That's good. No.

1490
01:21:46,483 --> 01:21:48,280
-Read me something from your diary.
-What?

1491
01:21:48,443 --> 01:21:52,721
" Perchance to dream,
perchance to love a wind-- Hair....

1492
01:21:52,883 --> 01:21:56,273
--the summer skies
as teardrops cascade from my lo--"

1493
01:21:59,523 --> 01:22:01,479
Oh, my God. My husband.

1494
01:22:02,683 --> 01:22:04,116
This is not what it looks like.

1495
01:22:04,283 --> 01:22:06,160
Looks like you're running
some naked drill.

1496
01:22:06,323 --> 01:22:07,312
Exactly.

1497
01:22:07,483 --> 01:22:09,713
-Carry on.
-With what? Kissing your wife?

1498
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,158
Good one. Five, six, seven, eight.

1499
01:22:12,323 --> 01:22:15,076
<i>l said, hey, Tigers! Yeah?</i>
<i>l said, hey, Tigers! Yeah?</i>

1500
01:22:15,243 --> 01:22:16,756
Hold it.

1501
01:22:18,963 --> 01:22:23,275
l'm gonna lay my hands on you to get
a really good sense of your movement.

1502
01:22:23,443 --> 01:22:24,922
Five, six, seven, eight.

1503
01:22:25,123 --> 01:22:26,875
<i>-l said, hey, Tigers!</i>
<i>-Yeah!</i>

1504
01:22:27,043 --> 01:22:28,999
<i>-l said, hey, Tigers!</i>
<i>-Yeah!</i>

1505
01:22:29,163 --> 01:22:31,597
<i>-What do we</i> <i>like to--?</i>
<i>-Panther meat!</i>

1506
01:22:31,803 --> 01:22:33,998
Sweet Jesus, mother of God!

1507
01:22:34,963 --> 01:22:38,194
l don't wanna run laps all afternoon.
l have a shrink appointment.

1508
01:22:38,363 --> 01:22:41,161
Dude, your cousin stuck his finger
in your ass. Get over it.

1509
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:43,200
Dude, your dad put his wang
on your shoulder.

1510
01:22:43,363 --> 01:22:45,593
Dude, your mom gave you an HJ
and tipped you a dollar.

1511
01:22:45,763 --> 01:22:47,833
Your cousin whacked you
in the face with his wang.

1512
01:22:48,003 --> 01:22:51,279
Come on, your cousin put his weiner
on your plate. You gotta get over it.

1513
01:22:51,443 --> 01:22:53,593
Will you shut up, man?
l'm too straight to be gay.

1514
01:22:53,763 --> 01:22:57,642
l could watch <i>What Not to Wear</i>
with Nathan Lane in my blouse...

1515
01:22:57,843 --> 01:22:59,799
...and still win a straight award.

1516
01:22:59,963 --> 01:23:00,952
That's not right.

1517
01:23:01,123 --> 01:23:02,954
l could smoke pole
and still be straight.

1518
01:23:03,123 --> 01:23:05,193
-l can't say "smoke pole"?
-No.

1519
01:23:07,003 --> 01:23:08,595
Carly. Come here.

1520
01:23:08,763 --> 01:23:11,323
We're working on a new mount
Bianca came up with.

1521
01:23:11,483 --> 01:23:14,122
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1522
01:23:14,283 --> 01:23:16,399
-We didn't order these.
-No shit, lesbatron.

1523
01:23:16,563 --> 01:23:19,316
No shit, lndigo Girl.
No shit, Lesbos, island of Greece.

1524
01:23:19,483 --> 01:23:21,917
No shit, queer-leader.
No shit, Dixie Chick.

1525
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:24,472
Wait, what? Just joking. Sorry.

1526
01:23:24,683 --> 01:23:26,514
The Fountain of Troy?

1527
01:23:26,683 --> 01:23:28,719
l thought that move
was prohibidabido.

1528
01:23:30,683 --> 01:23:32,275
lt's not prohibidabido?

1529
01:23:32,443 --> 01:23:34,274
No, l'm pretty sure
it's prohibibabido.

1530
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:37,272
Cut.

1531
01:23:37,443 --> 01:23:39,559
Go ahead and clap.

1532
01:23:40,283 --> 01:23:42,319
Mediocrity des<i>erve</i>s applause.

1533
01:23:42,483 --> 01:23:45,475
Why don't we go find a Ford Focus
and clap around it?

1534
01:23:49,283 --> 01:23:50,682
Mascot down!

1535
01:23:52,483 --> 01:23:54,201
lt's a dragon!

1536
01:23:56,443 --> 01:23:57,762
Tell me about that road.

1537
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:03,155
ls it lonely on that road?

1538
01:24:08,763 --> 01:24:10,082
Have you made up your mind?

1539
01:24:12,203 --> 01:24:15,320
-You gonna waste any more time?
-No!

1540
01:24:17,603 --> 01:24:18,638
Then here we go.

1541
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:34,832
-F-U!
-F-U!

1542
01:24:41,523 --> 01:24:42,797
You're damn straight. F-U!

1543
01:26:15,163 --> 01:26:18,473
l can't take this head anymore.
Oh, the air feels so good.

1544
01:26:20,123 --> 01:26:21,397
All right, kiss me.

1545
01:26:22,683 --> 01:26:23,798
What are you doing?

1546
01:26:24,883 --> 01:26:26,760
Keep it on, sexy beast.

1547
01:26:40,963 --> 01:26:43,523
And that's how you kiss a guy.

1548
01:26:44,443 --> 01:26:45,432
Okay.

1549
01:26:45,603 --> 01:26:47,798
All right, again.
