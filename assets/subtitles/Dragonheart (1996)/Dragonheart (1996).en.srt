2
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,607
Not bad.

3
00:01:07,738 --> 00:01:10,312
But not good enough to live.

4
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:24,252
Mind if I sit down?
I don't have your energy.

5
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:26,584
Fight with your head.

6
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:31,465
Not your heart.

7
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:46,439
Straight.

8
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:48,938
Better, Einon.

9
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:51,820
But you're still dead.

10
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:01,034
Purpose, not passion.

11
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:14,716
No one ever found victory
in the dirt.

12
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:20,637
The peasants are revolting.

13
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:23,007
They've always been revoltin', Prince.

14
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,343
But now they're rebellin'.

15
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,013
King Freyne wants his son
to witness his noble victory.

16
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,648
There's nothing noble
about crushing desperate men.

17
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:34,650
They're traitorous scum!

18
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:36,937
The king commands!
Bring him!

19
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,452
You can come, too, nursemaid.

20
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:51,602
Die, you dog!

21
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:05,781
- I wish we were down there.
- No, you don't.

22
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:08,274
Yes, I do. Just to see you
in action, Bowen.

23
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:10,948
Yours would be
the finest blade on the field.

24
00:04:10,996 --> 00:04:13,951
My blade was not made
for your father's slaughter.

25
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,119
He is my father, Bowen,
and he is the king.

26
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,126
Yes.

27
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:21,579
But when you are king,
remember today...

28
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:24,467
and the difference
between battle and butchery.

29
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:26,758
And remember the Old Code.

30
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:28,962
Then you'll be a greater king
than your father.

31
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:34,133
I promise, Knight...

32
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:36,765
I will be greater.

33
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:16,351
Freyne!

34
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:19,843
Now, Hewe, now!

35
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,200
- He's trapped!
- Einon!

36
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:37,200
Einon!

37
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:49,374
Einon, no!

38
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:05,555
Enough! Enough!

39
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:07,938
The battle's out there!

40
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:31,252
Father?

41
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:48,187
Die! It's mine!

42
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:39,107
Einon! Einon!

43
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:42,820
I'm here, Einon!

44
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:45,777
I'm here, my King.

45
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,147
Dead, madam.

46
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:22,485
King Freyne,
your husband, slain.

47
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,691
In here!

48
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:33,488
In here, on the bed.

49
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,502
Get out! Out!
Out! Brok, out!

50
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:45,207
You stay, Bowen.

51
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,968
Forgive me, Queen Aislinn.

52
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:56,973
There's nothing to forgive.

53
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:59,683
His father's tyranny
brought him to this end.

54
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:05,224
He's beyond all help.

55
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,613
Not all.

56
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,750
A knight is sworn to valor.

57
00:09:23,837 --> 00:09:26,079
Sworn to valor.

58
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,586
- His heart knows only virtue.
- Virtue.

59
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:32,754
His blade defends the helpless.

60
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:34,882
His might upholds the weak.

61
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:39,307
You must stay awake, my son!

62
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:41,802
- You must stay awake. Repeat the Code.
- The Code.

63
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:43,889
His might upholds the weak.

64
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,144
H-His word speaks only truth.

65
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,145
His wrath...

66
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:51,277
Undoes the wicked.

67
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:05,367
Brok, stay there.

68
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:17,421
Lord! Great one!

69
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:23,638
Your song is sad!

70
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:26,349
Are the stars shining tonight?

71
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:30,306
No.
No bright souls glitter in this darkness.

72
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:40,319
Leave us. Go.

73
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:44,369
Aislinn, daughter of the Celts.

74
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,991
Whose people loved your kind
and called you friend.

75
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:50,997
Ah, the king's son...

76
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:53,496
cruel and full of trickery.

77
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,588
- Is this why you've come, dragonslayer's wife?
- Dragonslayer's widow!

78
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:02,469
This boy is not his father.

79
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:05,719
This knight here is his mentor.
He has taught him the Old Code.

80
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:10,513
I need your help.

81
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:25,110
The wound is deep.

82
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:27,741
You know what you ask.

83
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:30,405
I will teach him your ways.

84
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:33,584
He will grow in your grace.
He will grow just and good.

85
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,578
I swear.

86
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:39,882
No! The boy must swear.
Give me your sword, Knight.

87
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:41,882
Your sword!

88
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:52,561
Do not be afraid.
He can save you.

89
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:54,562
Now listen to me, boy.

90
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:58,355
Swear that your father's
blood lust and tyranny died with him.

91
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:01,568
Swear that you will live
and rule with mercy.

92
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:04,069
Come to me
and learn the Once-ways.

93
00:12:04,116 --> 00:12:06,073
Now swear!

94
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:08,489
I swear.

95
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:22,290
He's dead!

96
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,093
Peace, Knight of the Old Code.

97
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:30,091
Witness the wonders
of an ancient glory.

98
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:24,604
Half my heart
to make you whole.

99
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:27,818
Its strength
to purify your weakness.

100
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:31,273
Live, and remember your oath.

101
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:11,196
I served the father only
for the sake of the son.

102
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:14,072
All my hopes rest on him.

103
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:16,647
Forgive a doubting fool.

104
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:20,863
Call when you need of me.
Ask what you will of me.

105
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:25,083
My sword, my service are yours.

106
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:28,785
Only remind him
always of his vow...

107
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,879
Knight of the Old Code.

108
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,429
Brok.

109
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,354
Your Majesty?

110
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,566
The Romans built
this great fortress.

111
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:56,111
I will rebuild it,
and mine will be greater.

112
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,324
It will take many men, my Lord,
to rebuild this ruin.

113
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:04,237
Yes.

114
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:06,576
Yes, it will.

115
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:39,652
Not so rebellious now.

116
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:43,820
You should thank me, boy.
It was my stroke made you king.

117
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:49,445
No, Brok, I want no martyrs.

118
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:51,870
Death should be a release,
not a punishment.

119
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,793
Look good, dog.

120
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:58,962
I'm the last thing
you'll ever see.

121
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,341
Burn the insolence
out of his eyes.

122
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:07,009
No! No!
Not my eyes! No!

123
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,424
Father!

124
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,219
Run!

125
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:22,477
How dare you defy me!

126
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:26,153
Einon, you're unwell.
You've been bewitched.

127
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,490
Look at this!
It's madness!

128
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:32,200
- Remember the Code!
- The king is above the Code!

129
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,665
Have you forgotten
everything I taught you?

130
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:41,496
No one is above the Code...

131
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:44,342
especially the king.

132
00:17:05,446 --> 00:17:08,862
Dragon, I loved that boy,
and you changed him!

133
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:11,191
You tricked me, Dragon!

134
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:14,411
No matter where you fly...

135
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:17,699
no matter where you go,
I will find you!

136
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,703
Today I make a new vow!

137
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:26,214
I will spend the rest of my life
hunting you down!

138
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:33,757
Avalon, oh, Avalon.

139
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:36,519
For you I quest each day...

140
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:39,016
the resting place of Arthur...

141
00:17:39,063 --> 00:17:42,181
and the Old Code of his way.

142
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:45,232
And when I find
those holy stones...

143
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:49,060
I'll pray, I'll pray, I'll pray.

144
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:52,026
Oh, Avalon, bright Avalon...

145
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:54,909
think me not a fool.

146
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:59,864
My quest is not for vanity,
my quest is spiritual.

147
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,074
Spiritual!

148
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:05,375
Merlin, spiritual!

149
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,791
Whoa! Merlin!

150
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,789
Merlin! Ow!

151
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,926
Everyone's a critic!

152
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,454
- Dragon, dragon.
- Yes, I know. Where?

153
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,117
There, there.

154
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,283
Get back here, horse.
You coward.

155
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,825
Marvelous! Heroics befitting the days
of Arthur and the Round Table!

156
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:32,042
Never have I seen such skill!

157
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,167
Then you must have lived
the sheltered life...

158
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,338
of a mon...monk.

159
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:41,174
Why, yes. A scribe, scholar,
historian and poet.

160
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:44,180
Your servant, sir,
Brother Gilbert of Glockenspur.

161
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,723
My humble life is in debt
to your exalted prowess...

162
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,510
your dauntless courage,
and your superb, swift sword.

163
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:53,681
You have the poet's gift
of exaggeration.

164
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:55,892
Sir, you should read
my histories.

165
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:59,851
But you belittle your talent.
Modesty as well as valor.

166
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:02,651
The Code of ancient Camelot
still lives.

167
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:07,112
Hardly worthy of Camelot.
Still, it's one less dragon.

168
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:12,781
Well done, Knight!
Congratulations.

169
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,081
Our gratitude,
mine and King Einon's.

170
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:18,373
Uh, you can keep your gratitude.
I'll take the gold.

171
00:20:18,465 --> 00:20:20,837
- Yours or the king's.
- Gold, Knight?

172
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:24,381
We made a bargain, remember?
One dragon put down, one bag of gold.

173
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:27,173
Your honor has a price,
Sir Knight?

174
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:29,548
It has expenses.

175
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:32,216
Honor won't feed my belly
nor shoe my horse.

176
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,345
The priest is right.

177
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:38,346
It is your duty to protect King Einon's
vassals as a knight of the realm.

178
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,153
Not of this realm.
I bend no knee to Einon.

179
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:45,405
I should have known.
Foreign riffraff!

180
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:48,152
Well, begone, vagabond,
before I arrest you!

181
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:51,575
Back to work, you scum!

182
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:54,830
If King Einon's wheat
isn't cut before the rain...

183
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,323
I'll do a little cutting
of my own!

184
00:20:58,294 --> 00:21:00,500
Sir Knight!
Sir Knight, wait!

185
00:21:02,172 --> 00:21:03,798
Sir Knight!

186
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:05,923
Hear me out!

187
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:08,541
I'm on a pilgrimage.
Might we travel together?

188
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:11,880
The road's still free,
unless Einon's taxed it.

189
00:21:21,774 --> 00:21:25,474
A road tax, King Einon. Hmm?

190
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:28,108
A road tax.

191
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:31,239
They are your roads, after all.

192
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:33,739
People really ought to pay
for the privilege of using them.

193
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:36,905
- And those that can't pay will have to work it off.
- Ingenious, Felton.

194
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:39,743
Only you could keep such a good brain
under such a bad hat.

195
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:42,958
That's very good, "bad hat."

196
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:45,291
Out of my way, peacock.

197
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:48,423
Brok, some are good at hunting men,
some are good at hunting money.

198
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:51,173
Both have value for me.

199
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:56,862
Kara?

200
00:22:59,036 --> 00:23:01,989
Kara, I told you...

201
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:05,572
- I told you not to come here anymore.
- I'm a disobedient child.

202
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:10,077
Go on. Take a drink. Go on.

203
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:13,377
Magnificent shot, Your Highness!

204
00:23:13,465 --> 00:23:16,714
- Care to double the wager?
- Ah, yes, happily.

205
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,752
Shall we say the water bucket?

206
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:21,134
Stand still. Stand still.

207
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:25,888
Superb!

208
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:27,886
Double again?

209
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:30,766
Double again. Why not?

210
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:35,023
I say.

211
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,062
A moving target.

212
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:39,230
Peasant scum.

213
00:23:45,872 --> 00:23:48,623
You've got a nerve,
interfering with the king's sport!

214
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,411
There's no sport in tormenting a sick, old man.

215
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:56,586
I beg Your Majesty,
let him go.

216
00:23:56,632 --> 00:24:00,131
It's been 12 years.
Your castle is built.

217
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:03,669
He can do you no more harm.

218
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:08,089
For God's sake, release him.

219
00:24:13,772 --> 00:24:16,262
Father!

220
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:18,979
I've always said death is a release,
not a punishment.

221
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:21,606
Go.

222
00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:28,784
Kara.

223
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:16,825
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!

224
00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:20,493
I've decided to compose
"The Ballad of Bowen"!

225
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:24,798
- How do you prefer I should write this?
- Far away!

226
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,044
Oh, don't concern yourself
with my safety!

227
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:31,302
I mean verse, meter.

228
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:35,925
Shall I spice it up
with a poetical flourish...

229
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:38,639
or just the cold, hard facts?

230
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:40,646
If you do not be quiet...

231
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:43,692
you and I shall be the only things
that are cold and hard around here.

232
00:25:43,777 --> 00:25:47,690
I mean, it's all very well to go
hacking and whacking at dragons.

233
00:25:47,738 --> 00:25:52,364
But if a dragon falls in the forest and
nobody gets to hear about it, does it make a thud?

234
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:54,982
- Brother Gilbert.
- What?

235
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:08,296
The quill is mightier than the s...

236
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:10,291
Ooh.

237
00:26:10,384 --> 00:26:14,003
The quill is mightier than the...

238
00:26:22,646 --> 00:26:25,732
That's all that's left
of the last dragonslayer...

239
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,059
who tangled with me!

240
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,560
If I were you,
I'd quit while I was ahead.

241
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:41,946
Is that the best you can do?

242
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:47,876
Catch!

243
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:51,420
You know, I've got quite
a collection of victims in here.

244
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:53,714
I won't be added to it!

245
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:59,715
I've given you
my final warning.

246
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:02,719
Into the mouth of death he strode.

247
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:05,804
Into the gringy gloom.

248
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:08,647
Into the pit of fear unknown...

249
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:11,402
perhaps to court his doom.

250
00:27:11,444 --> 00:27:13,981
That was good.

251
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:16,396
What did I say?
What did I say?

252
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:26,791
A little damp for fire, isn't it?

253
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:30,575
Why must you knight-errants
out to make a name for yourselves...

254
00:27:30,628 --> 00:27:32,620
always pick on us dragons?

255
00:27:32,713 --> 00:27:35,040
I don't need a name!

256
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:37,422
And I have a collection of my own!

257
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:40,918
Yeah? You're one
who kills dragons for money.

258
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,378
It's honest enough work.

259
00:27:43,473 --> 00:27:45,429
One must earn a living.

260
00:27:45,474 --> 00:27:49,638
Oh, yes, one must live.

261
00:27:49,729 --> 00:27:53,643
Well, since you seek a profit,
we might as well begin.

262
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:56,306
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

263
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,813
It's not the profit.
It's the pleasure.

264
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:04,116
Perhaps less pleasurable
and more costly than you think!

265
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:11,957
Bowen! Bowen, take care!

266
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,668
He went that way!

267
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:16,874
Take care, Bowen!

268
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:10,218
You can't fly forever!

269
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:13,841
- Neither can you!
- Slow down!

270
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:17,476
Come, visit the woods!

271
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:21,891
Whoa!

272
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:32,365
Look out! Well done!

273
00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:35,412
- Ow!
- Pity. That must have hurt.

274
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:37,573
- Yeah!
- Again?

275
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,575
- Ow!
- And again?

276
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:41,869
How do you like the ride so far?

277
00:29:43,672 --> 00:29:46,589
We're earning our money now,
aren't we?

278
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:51,550
Now, is there somewhere you
would like me to drop you off?

279
00:29:58,685 --> 00:30:01,140
Yikes!

280
00:30:07,653 --> 00:30:11,816
The sword against the fang and claw.
The flame against the shield.

281
00:30:11,906 --> 00:30:13,899
Blah, blah, blah,
which one would win?

282
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,617
Blah, blah,
field, shield, wield.

283
00:30:17,706 --> 00:30:20,327
Whose flesh from bones
be peeled. Oh, no.

284
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,412
Whose fate would soon be sealed.

285
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,453
Whose fate would soon be sealed?

286
00:30:26,546 --> 00:30:29,583
Whose fate would soon be sealed!

287
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:36,094
Oh, you're good. Haven't had
this sort of challenge in some time.

288
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:38,216
Nor likely to again!

289
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,575
Drat!

290
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:14,496
A little overconfident, aren't we?

291
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:18,174
Hardly. But if you win,
you'll be out of work.

292
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,170
I will not stop until I've rid the world
of every last one of you.

293
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:24,509
I am the last one!

294
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:51,210
You're just trying to save
your scaly hide with tricks.

295
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:56,339
Haven't you noticed the pickings
are rather slim these days?

296
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:59,708
I got me one just the other day.

297
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:04,214
So it was you who killed the Scarred One.
She and I were the last.

298
00:32:04,264 --> 00:32:07,181
Must've been a proud kill, warrior.

299
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,560
How much gold did her tattered carcass
put in your purse?

300
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:12,770
That's none of your business.

301
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:16,558
Couldn't have been very much.
And you'll kill me for sport?

302
00:32:16,862 --> 00:32:19,565
And when there are
no more dragons to slay...

303
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:21,778
how will you make
a living, Knight?

304
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:23,609
Shut up!

305
00:32:38,883 --> 00:32:41,253
Whoa!

306
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:48,588
If your teeth come down, my sword
goes up, right into your brain!

307
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:57,519
If your sword goes up,
my teeth come down!

308
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:01,273
Into the moonlit night
the titans dueled...

309
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:04,277
in mortal combat bound.

310
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:08,824
Oh, who'd the fatal
false step make?

311
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,279
Whose blood
would stain the ground?

312
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:35,342
Oh, good Lord.
Sir Eglamore.

313
00:33:35,435 --> 00:33:38,471
Oh, thank you very much.

314
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:40,810
It's been stuck down there
for months.

315
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:43,147
Can you get your buttocks
off my tongue?

316
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:45,316
Why should you be comfortable?

317
00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:49,779
My armor is rusting in your drool,
and your breath is absolutely foul.

318
00:33:49,823 --> 00:33:51,946
Well, what do you expect...

319
00:33:51,991 --> 00:33:54,946
with old knights rotting
between my molars?

320
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:57,118
Oh, God, my mouth is so dry.

321
00:34:00,334 --> 00:34:02,622
No, no, no, stop!

322
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:04,662
No, stop!

323
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:11,170
Sorry about that.

324
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,173
It seems we're in a bit of a stalemate,
wouldn't you say?

325
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:17,348
Yuck! But I can go
three days without sleep.

326
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:19,556
I can go three weeks.

327
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:23,060
Ooh!
I'll stab you before I nod off.

328
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:27,525
And I'll chomp you.
Marvelous, we'll kill each other.

329
00:34:27,611 --> 00:34:30,149
- What do you suggest?
- A truce.

330
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:33,316
Get out of my mouth
and let's talk face-to-face.

331
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:36,200
How do I know I can trust you?

332
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:39,113
I give you my word.

333
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:42,240
The word of a dragon.
It's worthless.

334
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:45,866
Stubborn lout!

335
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:52,045
I should have known!

336
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,921
Go on. Kill me!

337
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,559
I don't want to kill you!
I never did!

338
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:05,050
And I don't want you to kill me!

339
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,055
How do we gain?

340
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:10,149
If you win, you lose a trade.

341
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:13,069
If I win, I wait around
for the next sword slinger...

342
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,647
thirsting to carve a reputation
out of my hide.

343
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:19,067
And I'm tired of lurking in holes...

344
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:21,200
and skulking in darkness.

345
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:23,946
I'm gonna let you up now.

346
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,412
And if you insist...

347
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:29,910
we can pursue this fracas
to its final stupidity.

348
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:34,124
Or you can listen
to my alternative.

349
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:44,759
Hmm?

350
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,928
What's the alternative?

351
00:35:53,108 --> 00:35:56,109
Father, Father, look!

352
00:35:58,947 --> 00:36:00,905
Dragon!

353
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:07,950
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

354
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,074
Out of the way!

355
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:39,278
Pesky critters, dragons.

356
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:42,986
You!

357
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:46,484
Like big rats.
You never seem to get rid of them.

358
00:36:46,577 --> 00:36:50,325
Unless you pay me
two bags of gold, in advance.

359
00:36:59,004 --> 00:37:01,128
Come on, Dragon.

360
00:37:03,008 --> 00:37:05,581
Come on, Dragon.

361
00:37:06,846 --> 00:37:08,805
Yes!

362
00:37:10,434 --> 00:37:12,343
Ow!

363
00:38:00,522 --> 00:38:03,806
Hmm.

364
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:07,144
Hello.

365
00:38:08,238 --> 00:38:11,772
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine.

366
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:15,234
Most profitable, Dragon.
I should have met you a long time ago.

367
00:38:15,285 --> 00:38:17,742
There is much gold in the world.

368
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:21,456
Perhaps when you've had your fill of it,
you'll no longer need me.

369
00:38:21,544 --> 00:38:25,078
I am a Knight of the Old Code.
My word is my bond.

370
00:38:25,131 --> 00:38:28,664
- No compunctions then?
- About what?

371
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:32,802
Well, such deception hardly befits
a Knight of the Old Code.

372
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:37,429
Fleecing Einon's lackeys.
That's a service to mankind.

373
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:39,093
Is it?

374
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:42,269
When you squeeze the nobility,
it's the peasants who feel the pinch.

375
00:38:42,313 --> 00:38:44,520
That's not my concern.

376
00:38:44,608 --> 00:38:48,190
Why should I stick my neck out
for people afraid to risk their own?

377
00:38:48,277 --> 00:38:50,814
Don't clutter up
a clever scheme with morality.

378
00:38:50,903 --> 00:38:53,146
Mmm, so be it...

379
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,241
Knight of the Old Code.

380
00:38:57,285 --> 00:39:01,151
If I wanted my conscience pricked,
I would have stayed with the priest!

381
00:39:01,246 --> 00:39:04,415
Huh! And what does a dragon
know of the Old Code, anyway?

382
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,618
His blade defends the helpless.

383
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:11,083
His might upholds the weak.
His word speaks only truth.

384
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:13,919
Shut up! I remember.

385
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:17,171
That's all it is, a memory.
Nothing can bring it back.

386
00:39:17,263 --> 00:39:20,133
You sound like one who tried.

387
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,133
And failed.

388
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:25,807
So I no longer try to change the world,
Dragon. I just try to get by in it.

389
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:28,856
Yes, it's better than death,
I suppose.

390
00:39:28,941 --> 00:39:31,645
Oh, is it? I should think
you'd welcome death.

391
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:35,778
You know, the last of your kind,
all your friends dead,
hunted wherever you go.

392
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:40,902
Do you delight in reminding me?

393
00:39:40,994 --> 00:39:44,444
Yes, Knight,
I do long for death.

394
00:39:45,706 --> 00:39:47,781
But fear it.

395
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:57,122
Why? Aside from your misery,
what's to lose?

396
00:39:58,051 --> 00:40:00,007
My soul.

397
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,205
Finish him, Brok!

398
00:40:35,672 --> 00:40:38,079
Well, are you a man?

399
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:51,517
Should he continue, Mother?

400
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:58,228
Oh, the field belongs to the apparently
inexhaustible Sir Brok, my son.

401
00:41:21,424 --> 00:41:24,341
The quarry!

402
00:41:26,345 --> 00:41:29,262
First you beg mercy
for your father's fate.

403
00:41:29,347 --> 00:41:31,340
Then you try to avenge it.

404
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:35,097
Now, you'll share it.

405
00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:38,347
In your kingdom, Einon,
there are worse fates than death.

406
00:41:41,191 --> 00:41:43,230
I'll think one up for you.

407
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:48,818
- Take her away.
- No! No!

408
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:54,903
He killed my father!

409
00:41:54,954 --> 00:41:57,446
He killed my father!

410
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:02,663
He killed my father!

411
00:43:00,101 --> 00:43:02,557
I remember you now.

412
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:06,603
I remember you.

413
00:43:09,026 --> 00:43:13,272
Your hair, like fire.

414
00:43:17,452 --> 00:43:19,989
You gave me this scar.

415
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:24,448
Didn't you?

416
00:43:31,548 --> 00:43:35,710
I...owe...you.

417
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:53,139
I can, uh...

418
00:43:53,234 --> 00:43:55,475
I really can.

419
00:44:02,745 --> 00:44:06,529
Sorry, Bowen.
I hope you like it well done.

420
00:44:12,377 --> 00:44:15,628
You must have hated us very much.

421
00:44:15,714 --> 00:44:18,252
I hated one of you.

422
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,593
These I killed because I wanted
to kill him. But I never found him.

423
00:44:22,678 --> 00:44:25,931
I never will.
If you're the last, he must be dead.

424
00:44:25,976 --> 00:44:27,932
Oh, yes.

425
00:44:27,977 --> 00:44:30,265
Tell me, what was he like...

426
00:44:30,312 --> 00:44:32,803
this, uh, dragon
that you hated?

427
00:44:34,691 --> 00:44:37,526
He only had half a heart.

428
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:40,101
But even that was enough
to pollute an innocent boy.

429
00:44:40,154 --> 00:44:43,108
Einon was no innocent!
He polluted the heart!

430
00:44:44,617 --> 00:44:46,573
How do you know that?

431
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:48,826
How do you know that, Dragon?

432
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,627
All dragons know that story.

433
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:56,202
What was to be their hope
became their doom.

434
00:44:56,297 --> 00:45:00,625
A spoiled, ungrateful child was given
a great gift and destroyed it!

435
00:45:00,675 --> 00:45:05,965
No! I knew Einon.
I was his teacher.

436
00:45:06,055 --> 00:45:09,470
I taught him
the ways of honor, of right.

437
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:13,261
Then he betrayed you...

438
00:45:13,313 --> 00:45:17,013
just as he betrayed
the dragon whose heart he broke.

439
00:45:17,108 --> 00:45:19,017
That's a lie, Dragon!

440
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:23,321
Stop calling me "Dragon"!
I have a name.

441
00:45:24,865 --> 00:45:27,437
Well, what is it?

442
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:30,492
You couldn't possibly pronounce it
in your tongue.

443
00:45:30,536 --> 00:45:33,738
- Try me.
- It's...

444
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:55,179
Next time stab more flesh,
less cloth.

445
00:45:55,268 --> 00:45:57,761
I'll pierce your heart!

446
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,192
You already did.

447
00:46:11,618 --> 00:46:16,243
A very special heart,
like no other.

448
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,532
A black, withered thing
without pity.

449
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,336
Then teach me.

450
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:29,956
Pity me.

451
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:33,884
I'll give you everything.

452
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,844
Even power.

453
00:46:37,892 --> 00:46:40,762
You're so beautiful.

454
00:46:48,778 --> 00:46:51,447
Even power.

455
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:54,772
Even a throne.

456
00:47:15,804 --> 00:47:17,760
Oh, dear.

457
00:47:17,805 --> 00:47:20,675
Thank you.
It's passed now.

458
00:47:20,766 --> 00:47:23,007
What was it?

459
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:26,351
An old complaint
that acts up now and again.

460
00:47:28,482 --> 00:47:32,943
Forgive me if anything
I said, if I upset you.

461
00:47:33,029 --> 00:47:36,065
It wasn't you, not you.

462
00:48:11,148 --> 00:48:13,022
Don't be afraid.

463
00:48:13,108 --> 00:48:16,692
I won't let you suffer
the same fate as me.

464
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,820
I've come to help you.

465
00:48:25,204 --> 00:48:28,489
This will bring you out
well below the castle walls.

466
00:48:43,596 --> 00:48:45,838
Thank...

467
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,179
You.

468
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:01,900
Have you been watching over me
all night?

469
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,358
I've been thinking.

470
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:08,363
Yes? About what?

471
00:49:08,454 --> 00:49:12,866
Many things.
Mostly about what to call you.

472
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:15,034
I think I've found you a name.

473
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:18,542
You say that as though you reached up
and plucked it from the sky.

474
00:49:18,629 --> 00:49:21,167
I did.

475
00:49:21,215 --> 00:49:23,540
Up there.

476
00:49:23,633 --> 00:49:25,877
Do you see that group of stars?

477
00:49:26,972 --> 00:49:30,221
I know those stars very well.

478
00:49:30,308 --> 00:49:33,806
- Do you see the shape that they make?
- Mm-hmm, a dragon.

479
00:49:33,894 --> 00:49:35,803
Yes.

480
00:49:35,895 --> 00:49:38,019
They call it "Draco."

481
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:41,724
It means "dragon"
in the scholars' speech.

482
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:44,391
So instead of calling me
"Dragon" in your tongue...

483
00:49:44,487 --> 00:49:46,979
you'll call me "Dragon"
in some other tongue.

484
00:49:47,032 --> 00:49:49,820
You're right.
It's silly.

485
00:49:49,911 --> 00:49:54,488
No. No, I would be honored
to be named after those stars.

486
00:49:54,581 --> 00:49:57,416
I...I truly would.

487
00:49:58,793 --> 00:50:00,702
Thank you, Bowen.

488
00:50:01,837 --> 00:50:03,747
Draco.

489
00:50:09,804 --> 00:50:13,339
Throw off the yoke
of Einon's oppression!

490
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:16,557
We must start to fight back!

491
00:50:16,644 --> 00:50:19,846
Your father sang that sour tune once,
and we did fight back.

492
00:50:19,896 --> 00:50:22,221
And once was enough!
We'll not dance to it again!

493
00:50:22,315 --> 00:50:24,806
No, Hewe, just cringe
like a dog under Einon's boot.

494
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,225
At least a cringing dog's
a live one!

495
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:30,528
Hey! Why waste good food
on bad rhetoric?

496
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:33,651
I speak the truth.

497
00:50:33,744 --> 00:50:37,611
Truth?
It's rarely inspiring, lass.

498
00:50:37,705 --> 00:50:39,828
And it never wins rebellions...

499
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:43,913
but it will stretch necks,
if there is a neck...

500
00:50:44,002 --> 00:50:46,753
underneath that little mud pie.

501
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:57,347
Ready or not, here I come!

502
00:50:58,435 --> 00:51:00,226
Dragon!

503
00:51:06,901 --> 00:51:09,522
It's Draco!

504
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:11,520
About time.

505
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:20,154
Mmm!

506
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:23,616
It seems you people
are in need of a dragonslayer.

507
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,961
Where is the lord responsible
for this village?

508
00:51:29,547 --> 00:51:31,954
Brok lives in a big house
about six miles away.

509
00:51:32,049 --> 00:51:35,417
But he'll only blame any damage on us
and pluck our pockets to pay for it.

510
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:39,377
I won't pluck them as deeply.
I'll make you a fair offer.

511
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:41,881
Take it, or leave him!

512
00:51:52,445 --> 00:51:55,813
It's enough you people
grovel to Einon.

513
00:51:55,906 --> 00:51:58,906
Will you be bullied by some broken-down,
blackmailing knight as well?

514
00:51:58,992 --> 00:52:02,574
That's right, you don't need me.

515
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,571
Settle it yourself.

516
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:07,072
Of course, there are other ways.

517
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:09,408
Perhaps you'll part with...

518
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:12,502
one of your precious daughters,
instead of gold.

519
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:22,885
Dragons are partial
to maiden sacrifices, I hear.

520
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:27,349
Don't do this!
Don't do this to me!

521
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,726
I was born in this village!

522
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,771
You knew my father!
You knew my mother!

523
00:52:32,857 --> 00:52:35,976
- Who's the girl?
- A nuisance. Get rid of her.

524
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,897
- Why?
- They're trying to placate you with a sacrifice.

525
00:52:38,987 --> 00:52:41,657
Now, whoever gave them that bright idea?

526
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:44,368
- Never mind. Just get rid of her!
- How?

527
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:46,361
- Eat her!
- Oh, please! Yuck!

528
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,909
Aren't we squeamish?
You ate Sir Eglamore, hypocrite.

529
00:52:48,997 --> 00:52:52,165
I merely chewed in self-defense,
but I never swallowed.

530
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,167
Improvise.

531
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,537
All right, all right.

532
00:52:57,631 --> 00:53:00,039
He's coming! Quick!

533
00:53:29,327 --> 00:53:31,319
You have a beautiful voice.

534
00:53:31,412 --> 00:53:35,955
Oh, thank you. We dragons
love to sing when we're happy.

535
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:38,960
Well, you're not like a dragon at all.

536
00:53:39,046 --> 00:53:41,963
Well, how many dragons do you know?

537
00:53:42,048 --> 00:53:44,374
Well, you're the first.

538
00:53:44,426 --> 00:53:47,380
You should never listen
to minstrels' fancies.

539
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:51,212
A dragon would never hurt a soul,
unless they tried to hurt him first.

540
00:53:51,307 --> 00:53:54,224
Really?
Then why were you in my village?

541
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:56,598
Oh! The village!

542
00:53:56,686 --> 00:53:59,558
Yes, the village!
You remember the village?

543
00:53:59,607 --> 00:54:03,688
Leave him alone, you bully!
Run, Draco, fly! I'll hold him!

544
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:06,814
- Pick on someone your own size!
- Where have you been?

545
00:54:06,906 --> 00:54:08,898
I'm truly sorry, Bowen.

546
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:12,116
I've been distracted.

547
00:54:13,786 --> 00:54:16,990
Bowen, meet Kara.

548
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:22,324
- You should have eaten her.
- Oh, don't get angry, Bowen.

549
00:54:22,419 --> 00:54:24,379
Why not?

550
00:54:24,466 --> 00:54:27,086
You left me high and dry.
I was worried to death!

551
00:54:27,134 --> 00:54:29,803
Worried? About me?

552
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,128
Yes, about you!

553
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:36,426
I had the whacker all set up.
Half the village is out there with me.

554
00:54:36,475 --> 00:54:39,559
We're searching the skies for you,
I don't know where you are.

555
00:54:39,645 --> 00:54:42,646
If you're coming back,
when you're coming back. You just...

556
00:54:44,441 --> 00:54:45,985
Disappear.

557
00:54:47,487 --> 00:54:49,444
Be careful!
He's coming!

558
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,089
Well, well, well,
it can't be!

559
00:55:09,174 --> 00:55:11,083
But it is!

560
00:55:11,176 --> 00:55:14,212
My old mentor.
Still giving carving lessons?

561
00:55:14,304 --> 00:55:16,343
Get off your horse.
I'll give you one.

562
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:19,930
Time's not been
kind to you, Bowen.

563
00:55:20,018 --> 00:55:23,765
- You should never have broke with me.
- It was you who broke with me!

564
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:27,020
And yet you return to me
with this girl I lost.

565
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:32,653
I think she wants to stay lost.

566
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:35,317
Not her decision, I'm afraid!

567
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,368
I'm ready for my lesson now, Knight.

568
00:56:18,866 --> 00:56:21,736
That's one lesson you never learned!

569
00:56:21,827 --> 00:56:24,234
Only expose your back to a corpse!

570
00:56:26,497 --> 00:56:29,167
You are a corpse!

571
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,242
You just don't know it!

572
00:56:36,923 --> 00:56:39,249
Lie down, Bowen!

573
00:56:39,343 --> 00:56:42,630
You're the sorry scrap
of dead worlds and dead beliefs.

574
00:56:42,723 --> 00:56:46,091
No! They were your beliefs!

575
00:56:46,184 --> 00:56:48,176
Never. Never mine.

576
00:56:52,523 --> 00:56:56,056
You said the words!
You spoke them from your heart!

577
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:58,433
I vomited them up
because I couldn't stomach them!

578
00:56:58,527 --> 00:57:01,528
Because I knew it was
what you wanted to hear!

579
00:57:01,614 --> 00:57:05,150
Lies! Liar!
I taught you!

580
00:57:05,244 --> 00:57:08,078
You taught me to fight,
that's all!

581
00:57:08,121 --> 00:57:11,739
I took what I needed from you.

582
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:14,791
You taught me to fight!

583
00:57:27,808 --> 00:57:29,883
You taught me well.

584
00:58:10,847 --> 00:58:13,256
Who asked you to interfere?

585
00:58:14,435 --> 00:58:17,601
I had everything under control!

586
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,904
Here, let me see.

587
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:40,662
It's knitted well.

588
00:58:40,752 --> 00:58:43,622
You have a healer's touch, Kara.

589
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:48,420
In a few days,
it'll be just another scar.

590
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:51,794
And what's one more scar?

591
00:58:51,887 --> 00:58:55,302
To a knight, I mean.
I once knew a knight.

592
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:57,548
He stood all alone
against an evil king...

593
00:58:57,641 --> 00:59:00,051
and even saved a rebel leader
from blinding.

594
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:02,268
He must have had many scars.

595
00:59:02,356 --> 00:59:05,522
- That knight died of his wounds long ago.
- That's too bad.

596
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,015
His kind is badly missed
in this world.

597
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:11,361
- That's the way the wretched world is, girl.
- Doesn't have to be.

598
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,943
Men like you could...
could lead others.

599
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:18,276
You could give people
courage and hope.

600
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:22,238
Hope? Even if you
could raise your army...

601
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:24,906
do you think they'd stand a chance
against seasoned troops?

602
00:59:25,002 --> 00:59:27,124
Last time they tried
it was a massacre.

603
00:59:27,212 --> 00:59:30,876
- I remember. I was there.
- So was I.

604
00:59:32,425 --> 00:59:34,418
That rebel was my father.

605
00:59:36,387 --> 00:59:40,255
Let others stand with you. You'll see
this time the end will be different.

606
00:59:44,563 --> 00:59:46,805
What are you looking at?

607
00:59:46,899 --> 00:59:51,275
Myself, once upon a time.

608
00:59:54,697 --> 00:59:56,904
I'll see you in the village, Draco.

609
00:59:56,991 --> 01:00:00,109
That's easy for you to say.

610
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:03,778
This time I'll collect the money,
and you can die.

611
01:00:25,975 --> 01:00:28,892
We can lose no more pigs
to this dragon.

612
01:00:28,977 --> 01:00:31,222
Wait!

613
01:00:31,316 --> 01:00:34,851
This man is a fraud!

614
01:00:36,279 --> 01:00:38,604
It's her!

615
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:41,782
This girl is a...
wandering idiot.

616
01:00:41,868 --> 01:00:43,861
She babbles nonsense.

617
01:00:43,954 --> 01:00:47,617
I'm telling you,
this knight is no dragonslayer.

618
01:00:47,706 --> 01:00:49,828
You're mistaken, my child!

619
01:00:49,874 --> 01:00:53,160
He's the greatest dragonslayer
there is!

620
01:00:53,211 --> 01:00:55,501
Possibly the greatest
there ever will be!

621
01:00:55,547 --> 01:00:57,920
- Brother Gilbert!
- Bowen!

622
01:00:58,009 --> 01:01:00,048
You're alive.

623
01:01:00,094 --> 01:01:03,509
Praised be the saints.
The saints be blessed.

624
01:01:03,555 --> 01:01:05,679
You're alive!

625
01:01:05,724 --> 01:01:09,803
- And whole.
- Brother Gilbert.

626
01:01:09,893 --> 01:01:12,680
You could not put your trust
in a better man.

627
01:01:12,729 --> 01:01:15,729
I personally have seen him slay
almost two dragons.

628
01:01:15,815 --> 01:01:17,856
- Oh, Brother Gilbert.
- Almost.

629
01:01:17,902 --> 01:01:21,235
Well, I didn't actually see
the death blow of the second...

630
01:01:21,321 --> 01:01:24,358
but as Bowen is here,
he must have won.

631
01:01:26,243 --> 01:01:29,577
Don't you see?
He's in league with the dragon.

632
01:01:47,263 --> 01:01:49,387
Hold that there.

633
01:01:52,186 --> 01:01:54,391
And here he comes.

634
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:18,162
Sink! Sink!

635
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,871
I can't!
It doesn't get any deeper!

636
01:02:20,961 --> 01:02:23,796
Well done, Bowen!
You've done it again!

637
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:27,968
What a brute!
That's even bigger than the last one!

638
01:02:28,052 --> 01:02:30,293
Actually, he's about the same size.

639
01:02:39,647 --> 01:02:41,888
- Meat.
- Meat.

640
01:02:41,982 --> 01:02:44,733
Meat! Meat!

641
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:54,443
Oh, dear.

642
01:02:55,954 --> 01:02:59,322
Run! He's getting away!

643
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:29,064
What's going on?

644
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:30,859
Meat!

645
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:34,231
- Meat! Meat!
- Meat!

646
01:03:34,325 --> 01:03:36,994
Run. That's what's going on!

647
01:03:37,036 --> 01:03:39,870
- Run.
- Run?

648
01:03:45,209 --> 01:03:47,119
Kara! Kara!

649
01:03:56,761 --> 01:04:00,891
Peace, brothers, peace!
Heathens!

650
01:04:00,976 --> 01:04:02,884
Brother Gilbert!

651
01:04:05,396 --> 01:04:08,396
Oh, good Lord.
Forgive me, my child.

652
01:04:08,482 --> 01:04:10,391
Liar! Liar!

653
01:04:16,321 --> 01:04:19,405
No dragon, no charge.

654
01:04:19,491 --> 01:04:21,651
Meat. Meat.

655
01:04:21,744 --> 01:04:23,653
Meat. Meat.

656
01:04:23,746 --> 01:04:26,238
Meat. Meat. Meat.

657
01:04:33,048 --> 01:04:35,040
We're going to die!

658
01:04:35,092 --> 01:04:37,759
God help us!
We're all going to die!

659
01:04:37,843 --> 01:04:40,416
Calm yourself, Brother Gilbert,
we're not going to die.

660
01:04:40,512 --> 01:04:42,420
We're just flying.

661
01:04:42,513 --> 01:04:45,006
If you're going
to get yourself killed...

662
01:04:45,101 --> 01:04:47,342
you might as well do it
in the fight against Einon.

663
01:04:47,436 --> 01:04:49,926
I think Kara has a point. Oh!

664
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,898
But I'd rather discuss it
on the ground.

665
01:04:58,613 --> 01:05:02,610
Draco, what unholy place is this?

666
01:05:02,657 --> 01:05:04,650
Unholy?

667
01:05:04,743 --> 01:05:08,824
This is Avalon, the resting place
of King Arthur himself.

668
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:13,085
So it was foretold...

669
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:16,495
and so have I found you,
brave King Arthur.

670
01:05:16,587 --> 01:05:19,127
Valor,

671
01:05:19,217 --> 01:05:22,915
virtue, truth.

672
01:05:22,969 --> 01:05:26,302
Ah, yes, truth.

673
01:05:26,388 --> 01:05:29,925
Amen. Ready now, Kara.

674
01:05:30,978 --> 01:05:32,887
And you, Bowen?

675
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:39,775
This is Avalon,
the shadow realm of the Round Table.

676
01:05:39,819 --> 01:05:43,236
- It's a divine omen.
- Omens won't win battles.

677
01:05:43,323 --> 01:05:45,231
Nor will you.

678
01:05:45,324 --> 01:05:49,024
And you'll find out
when you try to raise your army.

679
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,656
You already know
the courage in your village.

680
01:05:51,746 --> 01:05:54,665
They're very brave at pelting
young girls with vegetables.

681
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,873
It must start somewhere.

682
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,000
Will you wish us luck, Draco?

683
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:04,794
Long ago, when man was young
and the dragon already old...

684
01:06:04,843 --> 01:06:07,333
the wisest of our race
took pity on man.

685
01:06:07,427 --> 01:06:09,800
He gathered together all the dragons...

686
01:06:09,847 --> 01:06:13,013
making them vow
to watch over man always.

687
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,390
And at the moment of his death...

688
01:06:15,478 --> 01:06:19,013
the night became alive
with those stars.

689
01:06:19,106 --> 01:06:22,023
And thus was born
the dragons' heaven.

690
01:06:22,109 --> 01:06:26,986
But when we die, not all dragons
are admitted to this shining place.

691
01:06:27,031 --> 01:06:29,024
No, we have to earn it.

692
01:06:29,116 --> 01:06:31,273
And if we don't...

693
01:06:31,367 --> 01:06:34,700
our spirit disappears
as if we never were.

694
01:06:34,787 --> 01:06:39,285
And that's why I shared my life force
with a dying boy...

695
01:06:39,377 --> 01:06:41,618
so I would reunite man and dragon...

696
01:06:41,712 --> 01:06:46,040
and ensure my place
among my ancient brothers of the sky.

697
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:50,302
But my sacrifice
became my sin.

698
01:06:50,387 --> 01:06:54,798
It was you.
Your heart beats in Einon's breast.

699
01:06:59,643 --> 01:07:02,434
Yes, my half-heart...

700
01:07:02,525 --> 01:07:05,608
that cost me all of my soul.

701
01:07:05,694 --> 01:07:09,940
Even then I knew
his bloodthirsty nature...

702
01:07:10,031 --> 01:07:13,364
but I thought my heart
could change him.

703
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:15,402
My God, I was so naive.

704
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,278
No more than I.

705
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:22,118
All my life I've dreamed
of serving noble kings...

706
01:07:22,207 --> 01:07:24,249
noble ideals.

707
01:07:25,338 --> 01:07:27,246
Dreams die hard...

708
01:07:27,339 --> 01:07:30,257
and you hold them in your hands
long after they've turned to dust.

709
01:07:31,761 --> 01:07:34,333
I will not be that naive again!

710
01:07:38,142 --> 01:07:40,429
Kara, I will go with you.

711
01:07:46,606 --> 01:07:48,766
So be it.

712
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:51,231
Farewell, Bowen.

713
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,071
Valor!

714
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:05,245
Valor!

715
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:09,537
Valor!
A knight is sworn to valor.

716
01:08:55,588 --> 01:08:57,666
A knight is sworn to valor.

717
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,047
A knight is sworn to valor!

718
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,922
His heart knows only virtue.

719
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:05,219
His heart knows only virtue!

720
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,632
His blade defends the helpless.

721
01:09:07,684 --> 01:09:09,842
His blade defends the helpless!

722
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,183
His might upholds the weak.

723
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:14,471
His might upholds the weak!

724
01:09:14,523 --> 01:09:16,930
His word speaks only truth.

725
01:09:17,025 --> 01:09:19,185
His word speaks only truth!

726
01:09:19,237 --> 01:09:21,361
His wrath undoes the wicked!

727
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:24,235
His wrath undoes the wicked!

728
01:10:06,741 --> 01:10:09,196
Now I know you're completely mad.

729
01:10:09,243 --> 01:10:11,485
- You want us to follow you
and a priest against Einon?
- Yes.

730
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:14,284
- To hell, more like. - But this time we can win.
You don't understand.

731
01:10:14,373 --> 01:10:16,912
I don't want to understand!
I understand this!

732
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,495
I understand six years in a quarry!
That's all I need to understand!

733
01:10:20,589 --> 01:10:23,078
Believe me, I know what you've
been through, Hewe.

734
01:10:23,173 --> 01:10:25,746
- But this time we've been joined...
- Only a fool would join you!

735
01:10:25,842 --> 01:10:28,002
You're not listening to what I'm saying!

736
01:10:28,096 --> 01:10:30,088
I've had enough
of your mischief!

737
01:10:41,067 --> 01:10:43,640
Save your strength
for the fight against Einon.

738
01:10:43,736 --> 01:10:47,897
- There isn't any fight against Einon.
- I'm going to start one.

739
01:10:49,072 --> 01:10:51,481
You and what army, Knight?

740
01:11:16,725 --> 01:11:19,133
You have never fired
a bow in your life...

741
01:11:19,228 --> 01:11:21,932
- in anger or in practice?
- No.

742
01:11:22,022 --> 01:11:24,478
Draw your bow.

743
01:11:24,566 --> 01:11:28,647
Sight along the arrow.
Release.

744
01:11:32,656 --> 01:11:35,229
Beginner's luck.
Try again.

745
01:11:40,831 --> 01:11:42,740
Steady.

746
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:49,455
Brother Gilbert, you're a natural.

747
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:54,632
Easy!

748
01:11:56,929 --> 01:11:59,502
Here, widen your stance.

749
01:12:02,268 --> 01:12:06,052
Up, down. Up, down.

750
01:12:06,147 --> 01:12:08,933
One fluid stroke.

751
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:18,487
This could cleave
a man's skull.

752
01:12:24,082 --> 01:12:26,074
Like a pudding.

753
01:12:37,677 --> 01:12:40,795
Eat.

754
01:13:01,491 --> 01:13:04,028
Whoa! Whoa!

755
01:13:06,244 --> 01:13:09,247
- I need more men!
- It's just a few peasants waving pitchforks!

756
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:11,621
I noticed they're all on your land.

757
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:15,244
You're not too busy hawking in your old
age to keep control of your minions, are you?

758
01:13:15,338 --> 01:13:18,256
You acuse me?

759
01:13:18,299 --> 01:13:22,380
I was just saying that any one of us
is worth a hundred of them.

760
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:28,972
My brave Felton,
an army unto himself.

761
01:13:29,059 --> 01:13:30,968
Well.

762
01:13:31,604 --> 01:13:34,275
Fool!

763
01:13:34,358 --> 01:13:39,268
I know this man who leads them,
and I will not underestimate him!

764
01:13:39,362 --> 01:13:41,687
Him or the dragon!

765
01:13:41,781 --> 01:13:44,023
Don't be afraid of the dragon, my son.

766
01:13:46,702 --> 01:13:49,156
I'm afraid of nothing!

767
01:13:49,245 --> 01:13:51,154
Nothing!

768
01:13:51,247 --> 01:13:53,488
You understand?

769
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,792
A mother's gift to her son.

770
01:14:03,885 --> 01:14:07,052
The finest to be had.

771
01:14:08,515 --> 01:14:10,637
The finest what?

772
01:14:11,809 --> 01:14:13,717
Dragonslayers.

773
01:14:28,826 --> 01:14:31,400
Have you thought beyond tomorrow?

774
01:14:31,496 --> 01:14:33,784
It's hard to see that far.

775
01:14:33,831 --> 01:14:36,367
Look at the camp.
What do you see?

776
01:14:36,457 --> 01:14:40,324
- What do you hear?
- Hope.

777
01:14:40,418 --> 01:14:42,329
Exactly.

778
01:14:42,422 --> 01:14:46,004
Down there you have life,
songs and courage.

779
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:49,253
You have everything you'll ever need.

780
01:14:49,344 --> 01:14:52,466
And now, so do I.

781
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:39,766
He dares defy me at my own gates.
Look at him!

782
01:15:41,895 --> 01:15:45,762
Well, today his Code
dies once and for all!

783
01:15:45,856 --> 01:15:49,642
No!
We're safe here, Your Majesty!

784
01:15:49,737 --> 01:15:52,309
That rabble couldn't possibly
storm the castle!

785
01:15:52,405 --> 01:15:55,157
By tonight they'll be
cold and wet and tired.

786
01:15:55,241 --> 01:15:57,233
They'll probably just limp off home.

787
01:16:00,579 --> 01:16:03,035
We're safe here, Einon!

788
01:16:03,082 --> 01:16:05,406
Remember your father!

789
01:16:43,788 --> 01:16:45,864
Gotcha!

790
01:17:01,638 --> 01:17:04,639
Bear to the right!

791
01:17:20,614 --> 01:17:23,367
Let's shear them
like the sheep they are!

792
01:17:25,495 --> 01:17:29,030
To the forest!

793
01:18:04,322 --> 01:18:06,148
Form up!

794
01:18:07,535 --> 01:18:10,655
Form up!

795
01:18:14,124 --> 01:18:16,117
Halt! Halt!

796
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:28,002
Second line!

797
01:18:29,846 --> 01:18:31,841
Right flank, advance!

798
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:37,060
Get in there,
second line!

799
01:18:42,068 --> 01:18:45,068
Charge!

800
01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:16,466
Scatter or die!

801
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,596
Scatter or die! Go!

802
01:20:06,066 --> 01:20:07,975
Like a pudding.

803
01:20:20,496 --> 01:20:22,819
Pride goeth before the fall.

804
01:20:22,913 --> 01:20:25,156
Help! Help!

805
01:20:27,252 --> 01:20:29,577
Help! Help!

806
01:20:31,673 --> 01:20:33,630
Turn the other cheek, brother.

807
01:21:05,998 --> 01:21:08,666
Retreat! Retreat!

808
01:21:08,707 --> 01:21:11,378
Retreat!

809
01:21:11,462 --> 01:21:14,130
Return to the castle!
Retreat!

810
01:21:14,214 --> 01:21:17,463
Brother Gilbert, it's Einon!
Stop him!

811
01:21:21,053 --> 01:21:22,796
Thou...

812
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:27,722
shalt...

813
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:30,135
not...

814
01:21:30,229 --> 01:21:32,386
kill!

815
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:08,130
The dragonslayers.

816
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:30,983
Open up! It's the king!

817
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:38,742
Stop!

818
01:22:38,835 --> 01:22:41,705
No! I want it alive!

819
01:22:45,801 --> 01:22:48,920
Alive and safe.

820
01:22:52,223 --> 01:22:55,260
Safe for all eternity.

821
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:57,598
Oh, no.

822
01:22:57,645 --> 01:23:01,263
I go to save the dragon!

823
01:23:01,316 --> 01:23:03,474
Who will go with me?

824
01:23:36,225 --> 01:23:39,973
Come from the shadows, Aislinn.
Come where I can see you.

825
01:23:52,657 --> 01:23:55,942
- You know why I've come.
- I know.

826
01:23:56,034 --> 01:24:00,911
In giving my heart, I've taken on every
poison stirring in his evil breast.

827
01:24:00,999 --> 01:24:03,536
Even the pain of his death
must be mine.

828
01:24:03,584 --> 01:24:06,372
You cannot blame yourself.

829
01:24:08,297 --> 01:24:10,539
Death without immortality?

830
01:24:10,633 --> 01:24:13,169
That was not the only reason.

831
01:24:13,217 --> 01:24:15,460
I had to wait for a time when mankind...

832
01:24:15,554 --> 01:24:19,172
would not repeat my mistake
and let tyranny thrive.

833
01:24:19,224 --> 01:24:21,928
When there would be those
who remembered the Once-ways...

834
01:24:22,018 --> 01:24:25,469
remembered that even in the darkness
there is still light.

835
01:24:27,066 --> 01:24:31,063
I cannot see.
Are the stars shining tonight?

836
01:24:34,572 --> 01:24:37,357
Brightly, my lord.

837
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,365
Brightly.

838
01:24:39,410 --> 01:24:41,735
Then let us end it.

839
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:50,786
Forgive me!

840
01:24:53,757 --> 01:24:56,841
I know why you brought me
the dragonslayers.

841
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,966
You wanted them to kill him
because you wanted me dead.

842
01:25:01,055 --> 01:25:03,761
I wanted to correct
a mistake made years ago...

843
01:25:03,809 --> 01:25:06,928
when I saved a creature
not worth saving.

844
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:16,434
How un-motherly of you.

845
01:25:49,226 --> 01:25:51,219
We have to open the gates.

846
01:25:51,311 --> 01:25:53,884
The rest of us are waiting outside.

847
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:56,518
Go save your dragon, Bowen.

848
01:25:56,607 --> 01:25:59,182
Hurry, all of you.

849
01:25:59,278 --> 01:26:01,187
It's this way.

850
01:26:06,993 --> 01:26:09,364
Well, well, well,
what a pleasant surprise.

851
01:26:09,452 --> 01:26:13,667
I expected you, Bowen,
but with my bride-to-be as well?

852
01:26:13,751 --> 01:26:16,917
- And with a priest to wed us.
- To bury you.

853
01:26:19,423 --> 01:26:21,665
Well, to bury one of us.

854
01:26:26,012 --> 01:26:28,503
Kara, the door, quickly!

855
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,287
Hurry up. That way.
That way.

856
01:26:59,378 --> 01:27:02,331
Quickly, this way.
This way.

857
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,338
Come on. Hurry up.

858
01:27:47,256 --> 01:27:51,003
Now, I don't know how
you all got in here...

859
01:27:51,092 --> 01:27:55,840
but I tell you this:
You are going to get me out.

860
01:28:05,941 --> 01:28:08,942
Hewe, thank you.

861
01:28:43,142 --> 01:28:45,977
Let me cut it down to size for you.

862
01:28:58,324 --> 01:29:00,482
A girl.

863
01:29:02,327 --> 01:29:04,404
A girl!

864
01:29:34,525 --> 01:29:36,932
Bowen!

865
01:29:47,204 --> 01:29:50,040
Lo, I'm immortal.

866
01:30:12,146 --> 01:30:14,933
- Yeah!
- Huh?

867
01:30:47,303 --> 01:30:50,387
Now it's you, Bowen.
It's you that has to do it!

868
01:30:50,431 --> 01:30:52,424
What are you talking about?

869
01:30:52,517 --> 01:30:56,384
As the heart binds Einon to me in life,
it binds us in death.

870
01:30:56,437 --> 01:31:00,021
- That's not true!
- You've seen that it is!

871
01:31:00,108 --> 01:31:03,025
Through the heart, we share
each other's pains and power.

872
01:31:03,111 --> 01:31:05,317
But in my half beats the life source.

873
01:31:05,404 --> 01:31:07,645
For Einon to die, I must die!

874
01:31:07,739 --> 01:31:09,733
Einon is dead.

875
01:31:09,784 --> 01:31:12,784
- He lives!
- It doesn't matter.

876
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:15,621
Don't you hear it?
Our rebels have stormed the castle.

877
01:31:15,705 --> 01:31:18,196
Alive or dead, Einon's beaten.
We've won!

878
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:21,541
You will never win until Einon's
evil is destroyed...

879
01:31:21,628 --> 01:31:23,834
and to do that,
you must destroy me!

880
01:31:25,966 --> 01:31:28,717
Once you swore your sword
and service were mine...

881
01:31:28,801 --> 01:31:32,171
to call when I had need of you,
to ask what I would of you.

882
01:31:32,263 --> 01:31:34,801
I hold you to your vow, Knight!

883
01:31:36,267 --> 01:31:38,473
He's coming,
coming to stop you!

884
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,644
Strike before it's too late!

885
01:31:51,073 --> 01:31:53,066
You are the last.

886
01:31:53,158 --> 01:31:56,160
My time is over. Strike!

887
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:59,739
You are my friend.

888
01:31:59,831 --> 01:32:03,531
Then, as my friend, strike, please!

889
01:32:04,669 --> 01:32:07,836
- I can't.
- Then I will make you.

890
01:32:10,299 --> 01:32:13,798
Fight back, dragonslayer!
Defend yourself!

891
01:32:26,689 --> 01:32:30,225
Pick it up!

892
01:32:30,318 --> 01:32:33,153
Move, and she dies!

893
01:34:11,374 --> 01:34:13,497
What now, Draco?

894
01:34:15,795 --> 01:34:17,953
Without you...

895
01:34:19,256 --> 01:34:21,663
what do we do?

896
01:34:21,758 --> 01:34:24,214
Where do we turn?

897
01:34:39,650 --> 01:34:42,520
To the stars, Bowen.

898
01:34:42,611 --> 01:34:45,018
To the stars.

899
01:36:27,421 --> 01:36:30,873
And in the days following
Draco's sacrifice...

900
01:36:30,925 --> 01:36:35,088
Bowen and Kara led the people
in a time of justice and brotherhood.

901
01:36:35,179 --> 01:36:38,714
As I remember it now,
those were golden years...

902
01:36:38,766 --> 01:36:41,719
warmed by an unworldly light.

903
01:36:41,768 --> 01:36:44,439
And when things
became the most difficult...

904
01:36:44,481 --> 01:36:47,814
Draco's star shone more brightly...

905
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:50,735
for all of us who knew where to look.

906
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,100
