1
00:00:56,212 --> 00:00:59,350
Hand Salute!

2
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:15,195
October 7, 2007

3
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:18,351
Four days till we deploy.

4
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:22,404
Grace knows I would do
anything to get back to her.

5
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,240
Anything.

6
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:29,499
Today, I wrote her a letter.

7
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:43,290
Good afternoon sir, I have the
briefing papers from the colonel's office.

8
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:46,701
Put them on the desk.

9
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,123
Thank you, Corporal!

10
00:01:57,758 --> 00:02:00,717
Major!
- Yeah.

11
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:02,127
Hope you don't have to deliver.

12
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:04,458
"Grace"

13
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,841
- God be there, be safe out there, Sam.
- Thanks, sir.

14
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,211
- See you when you get back.
- Alright.

15
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:21,530
- Have this.
- Love.

16
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:27,311
- Hello.
- Dad!

17
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,993
- Hey, baby!
- Hi, daddy.

18
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:32,464
- How are you doing? How was school?
- Great.

19
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,796
They gave me a new dress
to dye. She's in my room.

20
00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:39,657
Issy.

21
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:45,054
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

22
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,518
- What's wrong, honey?
- You're leaving again.

23
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:53,956
- Come give your daddy a hug.
- No.

24
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:57,767
- Come on, give me a kiss, honey.
- Just go.

25
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:00,938
- Two kisses?
- No.

26
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:02,882
Three kisses?

27
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:07,836
- I wanna read my book.
- Oh, you wanna read your book?

28
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,297
Oh yeah?

29
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:13,668
Oh, I see a smile coming out here.

30
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:19,282
- Now, you're getting a hundred kisses.
- Relax.

31
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:32,504
- Come on, daddy's got to go.
- Okay.

32
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,044
- Please, daddy. Will you let him stay?
- Yeah, can't you stay?

33
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:42,280
- It's my brother.
- He doesn't deserve you.

34
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:58,545
I feel alive.

35
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:26,503
How about my little brother?

36
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,634
No fucking way.

37
00:05:00,057 --> 00:05:04,064
Did you ever think of
apologizing to that woman?

38
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:09,933
- It's green.
- I got it.

39
00:05:21,352 --> 00:05:23,145
So, what are you gonna do?

40
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:29,074
I don't know. I was gonna...
cash this check and who knows...

41
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,898
- We'll see you later.
- Alright.

42
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:35,744
Don't rob the place.

43
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:52,194
You got hot water in this place?

44
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:56,155
No hot water... I'm freezing.

45
00:06:01,716 --> 00:06:06,128
- I'm sorry.
- I'm used to too much kitchen.

46
00:06:06,214 --> 00:06:08,798
He didn't expect to be
deploying again so soon.

47
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:13,020
- Yeah, they're ripping your hair off.
- What are you gonna do? They called, he answered.

48
00:06:15,606 --> 00:06:18,997
- We got you, granddad!
- Your raising a real hustler here, Grace.

49
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,387
I know.

50
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,902
- My birthday is this Spring.
- Didn't you say, it was at March 2?

51
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,017
- Hi.
- Hi.

52
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:41,021
- Are you Isabelle?
- No, I'm Maggie. If the bowl is big.

53
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:44,839
- I'm Tommy.
- Mom doesn't like you.

54
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:49,219
- Maggie!
- Well, that's what you said to dad.

55
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:52,724
This is for your mom.

56
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:56,349
- Mom, they're for you.
- Thank you.

57
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:59,265
Come in.

58
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,543
- Hi, sweetie.
- Mom.

59
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,057
- You made it.
- Yeah.

60
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:16,149
- Son.
- Sir.

61
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:20,528
- What? Hi.
- Hi.

62
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:25,612
Bless us O Lord and these thy
gifts which we are about to receive
from thy bounty through Christ our Lord.

63
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:26,961
- Amen.
- Amen.

64
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:33,867
And this is a very special meal for us
because we welcome my one son home
and we're sending another one off.

65
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:38,697
And we ask you Lord to keep him
safe and bring him back really soon.

66
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,158
- Amen.
- Amen.

67
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:45,006
You can do it.
You wanna try it.

68
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:48,761
Here, let me...

69
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:52,924
They're delicious.

70
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:02,873
- Why aren't you eating your peas?
- I hate peas.

71
00:08:03,444 --> 00:08:07,050
- I do, too.
- Honey, eat your peas.

72
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:10,988
Hey, dad.
I like peas.

73
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,237
So do I.

74
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:16,066
- When are you leaving?
- Tuesday.

75
00:08:18,345 --> 00:08:21,357
You love it over there, huh.

76
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,946
- It's my job.
- They only shoot the bad guys.

77
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:29,271
Who are the bad guys?

78
00:08:30,181 --> 00:08:33,343
The ones with the beards.

79
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,911
Your brother's a hero.

80
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:41,848
He's serving his country.
Don't you forget that.

81
00:08:43,878 --> 00:08:47,058
Will you be here for my birthday?

82
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:50,264
You know I will sweetie.

83
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:53,127
Sarah Miller's dad wasn't
there for her birthday.

84
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,577
- Isabelle.
- It's true.

85
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:59,090
She had to bring him
a cake in prison.

86
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:00,977
It's not just military families.

87
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:04,962
There's a lot of folks
on a pressure these days.

88
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,594
There's problems in all
walks of life.

89
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:13,031
Every family got their own set of problems.

90
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:18,025
They sure do.

91
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:23,189
What's that suppose to mean?

92
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:29,166
Every family has their own set of problems.

93
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:33,017
- You sound like a damn parrot.
- What?

94
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:36,001
Why don't you try mimicking
your brother, huh, for a change?

95
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:38,188
Dad.

96
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:42,080
This food is great, Elsie.
Thank you.

97
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:46,177
Compared to what?

98
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:52,666
- Other food.
- Prison food?

99
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:55,440
Tommy!

100
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:03,559
Excuse me.

101
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:07,995
It's okay, honey.

102
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:11,106
- It's his first night out.
- No.

103
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:35,380
Stay out of trouble.

104
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:39,200
Fine.

105
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:45,867
Be safe over there, alright.

106
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:01,923
- It's not coming off
- Try more soap.

107
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:05,600
Yeah, I almost got it.

108
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:11,270
There you go.

109
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:16,664
- Don't lose that.
- I'll do my best.

110
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:23,292
- Stick on your patience when I'm gone.
- I always do.

111
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:28,654
I love you.

112
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,723
I love you too.

113
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:00,817
Sam.

114
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,309
Take me with you.

115
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:09,458
Sure.

116
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:15,624
How about I go and
you stay with the kids?

117
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:20,161
Okay.

118
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:25,471
Don't go.

119
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,961
October 12, 2007

120
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:36,517
Back in Afghanistan with my men.

121
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:42,804
Weird, it almost feels like home.

122
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:22,663
Hi Cassie, George Jr.
was so great.

123
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:46,464
What's the distance to the out scene?

124
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,317
Three minutes up to the
tights of the out scene.

125
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:52,120
- Roger that.
- Three minutes!

126
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:43,934
Who is it?

127
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,554
It's Captain Sanders
and Chaplain Davis.

128
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:52,709
Hi.

129
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:57,646
- Hi, is your mother home?
- Yeah.

130
00:14:58,382 --> 00:15:02,424
- Where is she?
- In the bath.

131
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,514
Would you call her for us please?

132
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,664
What's wrong?

133
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:20,399
- Issy.

134
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:36,819
Come in.

135
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,725
You've reached Capt. Sam Cahill.
Please leave a message.

136
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,531
You've reached Capt. Sam Cahill.
Please leave a message.

137
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:42,826
Grace.

138
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:46,865
I didn't mean to wake you up.

139
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:53,261
I'm just driving off the car, Sam told
me I could borrow it whenever I wanted to.

140
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:59,469
The tail lights are all busted.
Some asshole...

141
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:06,466
Look, I don't...

142
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:11,310
Just say it, you know what I mean?
He told me I could borrow the car
whenever I wanted, Grace.

143
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:13,537
You look at me with this pissed off look.

144
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:16,017
Sam is dead.

145
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,812
He crashed.

146
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:24,070
- What are we talking about?
- He's dead, Tommy.

147
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:27,174
Come in.

148
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:36,277
What, fucking come in!

149
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:39,588
I just came here to drop off...

150
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:43,506
- Why didn't you call me?
- I've been trying to call you all night.

151
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:48,609
- Why didn't anybody call me!?
- We've all been trying Tommy.

152
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,443
Okay.

153
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:57,668
- How did let him go over there, Grace?
- Tommy!

154
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:02,240
For what now, huh!

155
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:21,365
Come inside.

156
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:25,517
Yeah, I just had to sit
down for a second.

157
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:36,307
He's with your mama now.
They're together.

158
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:10,067
Drink.

159
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:13,462
No.

160
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:47,135
Hey girls, are you ready?

161
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:48,136
In about just one minute.

162
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,639
- Why did you take your dress off?
- I hate it.

163
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:58,930
You gotta put it on, okay.
We have to go.

164
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:01,851
I don't want to.

165
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:06,782
I don't wanna wear mine
either, it's itchy.

166
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:22,312
Okay, come here, okay.

167
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:25,402
Come here.

168
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:33,411
Is Dad really dead like
your mom and dad?

169
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:25,021
- I'm sorry.
- Appreciate it.

170
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,296
- Sorry dear.
- Thank you for coming.

171
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,968
Sir, your son is the best
damn marine I ever commanded.

172
00:21:39,054 --> 00:21:41,922
I appreciate it.

173
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:47,775
Come on girls,
get in the car.

174
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:51,682
I'm so sorry for your loss.

175
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:57,768
Grace, Sam wrote this for you
before he left. He never wanted
me to have to deliver it.

176
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:08,614
I don't believe it, John.
I can't feel it.

177
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,685
Shouldn't I be able to feel it?

178
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:17,184
It's hard to accept.
He was a good friend, good marine.

179
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,466
- Why don't you let me drive?
- What are you talking about?

180
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:21,860
Come on, girls.

181
00:22:23,946 --> 00:22:28,953
- Why don't you give me the keys, Dad?
- What makes you so responsible all of a sudden?

182
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:34,161
- Let Tommy drive.
- Let Tommy drive. Look, I tell you what...

183
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:40,978
...why don't you get a job and earn some money,
buy yourself a car and then you can drive
wherever the hell you want.

184
00:22:41,064 --> 00:22:44,354
Give me the keys!

185
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:48,700
Did you hear those marines in there
today talking about your brother?

186
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:51,350
Did you?

187
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:56,679
Who's gonna stand up and
testify for you once you're dead?

188
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:01,195
It's my fault Sam's dead, right?
That's what you think.

189
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:04,706
It's got nothing to do with you, okay.

190
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:09,434
- What are you saying to me?
- Hank.

191
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,562
Forget it.

192
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:17,721
- You never had any guts.
- Oh, and you did.

193
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:20,134
That's why you screamed
at mom every fucking night.

194
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,565
That's why you drove us drunk.
Oh, hang in there, marines.

195
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:24,718
- Don't. Come on.
- Well, you put all that shit in his head.

196
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:28,717
- You'll never fill up my shoes.
- I know that.

197
00:23:28,803 --> 00:23:31,347
- You never could make me proud.
- Oh, for God's sake.

198
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:34,595
- Pride is a sin.
- Stop it! Give me the keys!

199
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:37,887
Here you go.
I'm walking.

200
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,564
This is a nightmare.

201
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,228
What's going on?

202
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:16,528
What are they gonna do with us?

203
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:20,936
- Is that yours?
- Yeah.

204
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:26,230
- Is that your wife?
- Cassie...

205
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:30,034
No, she's not.

206
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,401
You don't have a wife.

207
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:35,343
You don't have a family.

208
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:37,996
The only person you know...

209
00:25:38,082 --> 00:25:43,537
..is Private Willis and Captain Cahill.
You know nothing else.

210
00:25:43,623 --> 00:25:46,740
Yes, sir.

211
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:05,778
- Hello.
- Grace.

212
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,929
Tommy?

213
00:26:08,015 --> 00:26:10,253
Hi, I don't know it's like one in the morning...

214
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:13,876
It's three, it's three
in the morning.

215
00:26:13,962 --> 00:26:18,665
Great. I had a couple of drinks.

216
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:24,085
And apparently they're the most
expensive drinks in the world.

217
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:27,689
And now, I owe like $47.

218
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:34,297
I could've just walked out, but then,
this guy says that he's gonna tip me out of
disorderly

219
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:38,621
...and then I'd lose my parole.

220
00:26:39,123 --> 00:26:40,552
Which bar?

221
00:26:51,617 --> 00:26:55,253
Your nose is like a lunar eclipse.

222
00:26:55,673 --> 00:26:59,105
- Come on, let me touch it.
- Get your hands off me.

223
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:01,502
- Tommy, I'm sick of you.
- Just for a second. Come on.

224
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:03,003
Why get so upset with me?

225
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,049
- Alright, go ahead.
- See, nothing to it.

226
00:27:05,135 --> 00:27:09,322
- Big deal.
- That thing is huge, man.

227
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,043
- Grace.
- How much does he owe you?

228
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,330
$47 and two broken glasses.

229
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:16,272
-...so how about we say...
- Ready, come on, Cyrano...

230
00:27:16,358 --> 00:27:20,435
- Get your hands off the bar.
- Ignore it. That thing is huge.

231
00:27:20,521 --> 00:27:22,733
- How about we say fifty?
- I don't care about your money.

232
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:25,488
Just get him out of here.
I'm gonna call the cops.

233
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:28,776
Tommy, I have two little girls sleeping
in a parking lot at three in the morning.

234
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:32,150
You think you're funny?

235
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:37,486
Go home.

236
00:27:50,645 --> 00:27:53,346
Oh God!

237
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,935
- My head's spinning.
- Be careful.

238
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:01,475
- I don't think I should be carrying your child.
- Just put her in her bed, okay.

239
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:02,560
Oh yeah.

240
00:28:10,449 --> 00:28:12,427
- Uncle Tommy.
- Oh God.

241
00:28:12,513 --> 00:28:15,696
Uncle Tommy, wake up!

242
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:20,942
- Can you stop that?
- I'm making pancakes for mom.

243
00:28:21,028 --> 00:28:24,620
I can't stop, my sister said.

244
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,281
Stop it.

245
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:32,021
No.

246
00:28:42,062 --> 00:28:43,945
What are you doing here?

247
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:46,928
You want me to whisk in your face too?

248
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:51,516
This is not your house and
you are not the boss here.

249
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,966
Come on.

250
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,796
I'm making pancakes for mom
so she won't be sad.

251
00:29:06,882 --> 00:29:09,947
- Our dad's dead.
- He knows. He's his brother.

252
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:15,890
I know that.
Don't you get on a carton, it's gross!

253
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:20,692
- Shut up, you're gross.
- Do you want a pancake?

254
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:23,767
No... I don't like that.

255
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:27,356
- Our pancakes are the best.
- Eat your own crap, alright.

256
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:31,368
- Mom, you're supposed to be upstairs.
- What are you doing?

257
00:29:31,454 --> 00:29:36,196
- Surprise!
- I am surprised. Thank you.

258
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:40,743
One of the nicest little
girls in the world.

259
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:45,070
Who's that?

260
00:29:45,156 --> 00:29:47,715
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

261
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:53,514
- Good day babies, what have you got in your hand?
- Pancake butter.

262
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,798
Hi, sweetie.

263
00:29:55,884 --> 00:29:58,667
- Hey, let's go watch TV.
- Come on, girls.

264
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:06,639
- Bye Tommy!
- Well, we'll clean the mess up later.

265
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:21,530
Good morning.

266
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:26,124
Pancakes, huh.

267
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:30,712
Yeah, actually there's one
on the floor if you want it.

268
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:43,950
- What are they doing here?
- They're making pancakes.

269
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:52,136
Look um....

270
00:30:52,336 --> 00:30:56,606
- I was a little stupid the other day...
- Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

271
00:30:57,107 --> 00:31:01,674
- It was okay to drive...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know...

272
00:31:20,126 --> 00:31:23,774
I know Sam is always smarter than me.

273
00:31:27,582 --> 00:31:30,489
Not really that smarter...

274
00:31:30,575 --> 00:31:33,951
He was a damn good athlete.

275
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:38,290
Remember that game
with Easton.

276
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:41,319
Truly delightful.

277
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:50,540
He have some talent too,
you know, I mean...

278
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,676
He doesn't quit all the time.

279
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:57,679
That was different between you and him.

280
00:31:57,765 --> 00:32:01,361
Sam had no quitting in him.

281
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,627
I'll cut my throat to bring him back, Dad.

282
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:37,599
I don't know...

283
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:42,219
how they can live with
this kitchen the way it is.

284
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,910
Private, come here!
Fucking help me!

285
00:32:53,996 --> 00:32:57,153
I can't see anything.

286
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,298
They're looking for us.

287
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:10,757
Shit!

288
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:25,977
- Should we try again?
- Not right now.

289
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:49,286
Come on man, just put it where it is.

290
00:33:49,372 --> 00:33:52,195
Grace! Hey!

291
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:56,347
You remember AJ, Owen...

292
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:02,441
Sweeney, I don't remember your first name.

293
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:05,358
There was a reason for that.
It's nice to meet you, Grace.

294
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:09,257
You too.
What's going on?

295
00:34:10,137 --> 00:34:14,787
We're just fixing up the kitchen for you.

296
00:34:14,982 --> 00:34:17,406
Tommy...

297
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:22,694
Are you ever gonna
run this by me?

298
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,752
- Can you believe that? She's gorgeous.
- This is my house.

299
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:26,866
- Everybody's all grown up.
- It's not funny.

300
00:34:26,952 --> 00:34:29,912
- What the hell is wrong with you, guys?
- She's been...

301
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:33,460
You have to run this by me.

302
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,184
I was...

303
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:47,330
- Can I get you guys coffee, something?
- No, thanks.

304
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:51,393
- Maybe a beer.
- I would like a beer too.

305
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:55,914
Don't tell them anything.
Don't you tell them anything, private.

306
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,048
They aren't asking me anything.

307
00:34:59,134 --> 00:35:03,181
- They'll just starve us.
- Stick on, private.

308
00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:07,173
- Be present.
- I am fucking present.

309
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:11,142
I'm fucking present. I've been present
in this shithole for two fucking months.

310
00:35:11,228 --> 00:35:16,062
What the fuck did you save me for?
Why did you come after me?

311
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:20,523
I should've drowned in that lake.
We both be better off dead.

312
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:25,110
What day is it?

313
00:35:35,571 --> 00:35:38,340
Saturday.

314
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:42,124
What time is it?

315
00:35:49,025 --> 00:35:51,793
About noon.

316
00:36:21,214 --> 00:36:25,572
Remember what I told you.
No information. You give them nothing.

317
00:36:25,658 --> 00:36:30,122
- You give them nothing, private.
- Yeah.

318
00:36:37,676 --> 00:36:39,725
- Where will they take us?
- Don't speak.

319
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:43,099
- What?
- Don't speak!

320
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:50,719
- They're gonna cut our heads off.
- Not another fucking word.

321
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:32,396
Welcome.

322
00:37:43,186 --> 00:37:46,436
Use the satellite phone
to call my wife.

323
00:37:46,522 --> 00:37:48,807
She is pregnant.

324
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:53,837
You jeopardized your location
and your mission, Holy Amo.

325
00:37:53,923 --> 00:37:56,506
We have the same blood.

326
00:37:56,592 --> 00:38:00,061
Sayid is my nephew.

327
00:38:22,765 --> 00:38:25,557
Fuck!

328
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:36,124
This is our country.

329
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,994
You should not be here.

330
00:38:42,812 --> 00:38:45,946
Tell this message to America.

331
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,712
You say it...

332
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,588
I'll force you to say it.

333
00:39:39,663 --> 00:39:41,796
The girls are back.

334
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:45,153
It's a good thing downstairs.

335
00:39:49,817 --> 00:39:52,939
I'll see you tomorrow.

336
00:39:53,522 --> 00:39:58,128
Thanks, Elsie.

337
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:08,311
- Oh, she's painting the kitchen.
- I am.

338
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:11,279
Yeah, that's a spot right there.

339
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:14,783
You know, your dad was a great
football player in high school.

340
00:40:15,068 --> 00:40:16,068
Yeah.

341
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:20,276
He was small but he was a great quarterback.

342
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:26,048
Me and AJ and Owen used to go
to the games just to watch him play.

343
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:28,986
- Have you ever had the chance to see him play?
- No.

344
00:40:29,072 --> 00:40:32,990
- Issy, you're so tall.
- Thank you.

345
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:39,562
- Great job, Mag.
- Thanks Mom.

346
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:51,072
- Do they need to do their homework or something?
- No, they're just having fun.

347
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,107
Dip it real good.

348
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:57,107
Shit the pants!

349
00:40:57,792 --> 00:41:01,402
- What are you doing?
- Painting.

350
00:41:03,996 --> 00:41:06,499
These are brand new pants.

351
00:41:06,585 --> 00:41:09,133
- Hey, man.
- I'm sorry.

352
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,874
Man, she said she was sorry.

353
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,239
It's okay, Maggie.
I think I have something for you, okay.

354
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:15,060
- Just wait here.
- You have a bathroom.

355
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:19,326
- No, please don't bring the paint in okay.
- It's not that bad, man.

356
00:41:19,412 --> 00:41:23,537
- That's easy, man.
- There's almost nothing on you man, you look
fine.

357
00:41:23,623 --> 00:41:27,184
That will come out?
I mean, the real major cleanup is the floor.

358
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,381
- They're used to that.

359
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:32,896
It doesn't look that bad.

360
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,698
Right. Let's hug it out.

361
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:41,274
- What are you talking about?
- Hugs.

362
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,831
What?

363
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:47,402
Stay away from the kids.

364
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:28,078
You have a lovely body, Owen.

365
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:32,724
Laugh at me.

366
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,741
Do you workout?

367
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:41,752
Can I ask you where you got your underwear?
Coz they fit, they fit perfectly like...

368
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:44,187
You three weird guys
are so fucking funny.

369
00:42:44,273 --> 00:42:46,052
I'm asking you a serious question.
That's all.

370
00:42:46,138 --> 00:42:50,939
- This should all fit you.
- All I need is a t-shirt, pants, pants...

371
00:42:51,025 --> 00:42:55,771
- Take it all.
- I don't need all these.

372
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:04,451
You don't have to give me all these.

373
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:08,126
Take it all, Owen.

374
00:43:09,007 --> 00:43:12,061
- Alright, I'll bring it back.
- Jesus, are you listening? Take the clothes.

375
00:43:12,147 --> 00:43:15,746
- I'm not fucking asking you.

376
00:43:43,568 --> 00:43:46,932
You want to help your friend?

377
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:53,016
No, it's his turn.

378
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:59,259
- Just be strong private.
- Yes sir.

379
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:05,571
Fuck!

380
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:09,641
Don't give them anything.

381
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:11,993
Private!

382
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,248
- Your life depends on it.
- Please, please.

383
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:24,910
Motherfucker!
I'll fucking kill you lately!

384
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:31,570
My name is Private Joe Willis
of the United States Marine Corps.

385
00:44:31,656 --> 00:44:35,936
I was told I was coming here
to fight for my country...

386
00:44:36,326 --> 00:44:41,030
...but now I realized that
Afghanistan belongs to its people.

387
00:44:41,408 --> 00:44:44,834
And we have no business being here.

388
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,203
I love you, Cassie.

389
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:52,425
Joe Jr, your daddy always loves you.

390
00:44:56,744 --> 00:45:00,264
You have two daughters.

391
00:45:05,548 --> 00:45:07,670
- Great. Great.
- Come on.

392
00:45:07,756 --> 00:45:10,290
Stop.

393
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:15,815
"Do Not Enter"

394
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,710
"Don't come upstairs, go ->"

395
00:45:28,778 --> 00:45:31,099
"This way"

396
00:45:31,185 --> 00:45:33,491
"A little further"

397
00:45:40,308 --> 00:45:43,524
Happy Birthday!

398
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:51,239
- You like the kitchen.
- I love it. Thank you.

399
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,509
- Mom, this is from Deedee.
- Thank you.

400
00:45:53,695 --> 00:45:56,691
- You're welcome.
- Can I help you open it?

401
00:45:56,777 --> 00:45:59,473
- Yes, please.
- Is she looking out?

402
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:02,364
- No, she's occupied with her presents.
- Great job with the kitchen.

403
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:05,752
- What did he just tell me?
- He said you did a good job on the kitchen.

404
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:07,052
Okay, go, go.

405
00:46:07,715 --> 00:46:15,651
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

406
00:46:16,365 --> 00:46:27,043
Happy Birthday dear Grace!
Happy Birthday to you!

407
00:46:27,676 --> 00:46:30,639
Blow out the candles!
Come on, come on!

408
00:46:31,677 --> 00:46:34,552
Do it!

409
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:42,123
- Happy Birthday!
- Happy Birthday Momma!

410
00:46:42,209 --> 00:46:45,243
Thank you!

411
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:51,868
- Maggie!, Maggie!
- No!

412
00:46:51,954 --> 00:46:55,406
- Maggie, slow down.
- Maggie, be careful.

413
00:46:58,078 --> 00:47:02,120
- What are you doing?
- I wanna get to the ice before my momma.

414
00:47:02,206 --> 00:47:05,124
You gotta wait for her, sweetie.

415
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:08,262
Everybody loves Maggie.

416
00:47:08,348 --> 00:47:13,003
- Why do you say that?
- Coz she's lovable.

417
00:47:19,176 --> 00:47:24,421
Your dad saved me in that water
right there when we were kids.

418
00:47:25,816 --> 00:47:28,035
You know you're like your dad.

419
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:31,178
Am I?

420
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:36,698
Am I like my mom?

421
00:47:37,258 --> 00:47:40,342
Speed and image, yeah.

422
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:44,599
Accept to yourself, Isabelle
that everybody loves you.

423
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,900
Come on.

424
00:48:11,982 --> 00:48:14,949
I made it!

425
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:22,570
I talked to her for over an hour.

426
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:28,385
She said to me that she hadn't
slept right in over three years.

427
00:49:28,471 --> 00:49:32,542
She kept having these nightmares
that I'd come back and shoot her.

428
00:49:36,263 --> 00:49:39,065
And then...

429
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:44,300
I told her that it was alright,
that I wasn't gonna hurt her.

430
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:48,344
She just started to cry.

431
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:53,980
Right there in the bank,
she started to cry.

432
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:57,856
And...

433
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:01,272
then she thanked me.

434
00:50:02,308 --> 00:50:04,610
She...

435
00:50:04,883 --> 00:50:08,150
she said that she felt like...

436
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:11,509
she's safe.

437
00:50:12,174 --> 00:50:15,440
Like she could breathe again.

438
00:50:16,032 --> 00:50:18,910
Then she asked if I wanted
to open up a bank account.

439
00:50:18,996 --> 00:50:20,762
No.

440
00:50:20,848 --> 00:50:23,278
- Swear to God.
- What did you do?

441
00:50:23,364 --> 00:50:26,620
I opened an account.

442
00:50:29,386 --> 00:50:33,088
- I'm proud of you.

443
00:50:33,272 --> 00:50:36,937
I can't wait to start
bouncing checks.

444
00:50:49,128 --> 00:50:52,140
When I was like...

445
00:50:52,681 --> 00:50:55,712
seventeen or eighteen.

446
00:51:00,956 --> 00:51:03,625
I used to listen to this song like...

447
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:07,712
- ...over and over again.
- Me too!

448
00:51:09,738 --> 00:51:13,891
- Really?
- Why is that so surprising?

449
00:51:15,487 --> 00:51:18,229
I don't know...
I just...

450
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:24,460
- I took you more for like an NSync fan.
- Fuck you.

451
00:51:24,546 --> 00:51:26,649
Give me that.

452
00:51:26,735 --> 00:51:30,118
- Really?
- Really.

453
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:45,064
You think I'm such a square.

454
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:48,589
I'm starting to reassess Snoop Dogg.

455
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:57,902
Just 'cause I'm the cheerleader doesn't...

456
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:03,801
- Yeah, and you dated a football player.
- I am such a clich?

457
00:52:09,581 --> 00:52:11,873
You were kind of a pain in
the ass, you gotta admit that.

458
00:52:11,959 --> 00:52:14,289
No, I wasn't.

459
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:18,620
Guys always that girls were stocked up
if they won't talk to them.

460
00:52:18,706 --> 00:52:24,332
I just didn't like you.
You're always drunk and fighting...

461
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:06,099
I have to get some air.

462
00:54:52,609 --> 00:54:56,063
God!
Captain!

463
00:54:57,247 --> 00:55:00,267
Captain!

464
00:55:40,506 --> 00:55:43,663
Take it.

465
00:56:02,436 --> 00:56:05,505
What do we do?

466
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:09,271
He has no value for us.

467
00:56:10,257 --> 00:56:13,700
Just a weight on our shoulder.

468
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:18,744
Waste of food and water.

469
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,976
Kill him.

470
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:41,256
Pick up the pipe.

471
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:45,027
Pick it up.

472
00:56:45,455 --> 00:56:48,670
You have a family?

473
00:56:49,892 --> 00:56:52,875
Do you want to see them again?

474
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:56,360
Pick up the pipe!

475
00:57:00,857 --> 00:57:04,281
- Captain.
- It's you or him.

476
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:07,742
Kill him or I will kill you.

477
00:57:07,997 --> 00:57:09,758
Kill him!

478
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:14,926
- Kill him or I will cut his head off.
- Kill him!

479
00:57:15,854 --> 00:57:18,479
Kill him!

480
00:57:18,565 --> 00:57:20,756
Kill him!

481
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:48,456
There!

482
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:32,727
I brought you some molding.

483
00:58:47,805 --> 00:58:51,972
Hey look, I don't wanna ruin anything, alright.
I just wanna be able to come over and see the
girls.

484
00:58:52,058 --> 00:58:56,666
Please, I would love you
to come, see the girls.

485
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:03,953
We just miss Sam.

486
00:59:04,649 --> 00:59:07,231
Yeah.

487
00:59:11,034 --> 00:59:14,008
That's Hank.

488
00:59:22,097 --> 00:59:25,140
You still had it, huh.

489
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:32,249
When did you ever learn to be so handy?

490
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:20,227
- Got one there!
- Open fire, I got two more!

491
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:25,650
- All on board. We're moving forward.
- Come on, let's go.

492
01:00:27,784 --> 01:00:29,798
Raise your hands!

493
01:00:29,884 --> 01:00:33,413
- Stop right there!
- Raise your hands up. Come to me.

494
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:36,377
Come on, get your hands up.

495
01:00:36,463 --> 01:00:40,047
Get your hands up right here.
Get down.

496
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:46,583
Are you a marine?

497
01:00:48,553 --> 01:00:53,236
Cahill? Is that your name?
Is there anyone else with you?

498
01:00:56,521 --> 01:00:57,703
Coming!

499
01:01:01,383 --> 01:01:06,041
Get up! Get up!
We need a nose.

500
01:01:06,127 --> 01:01:08,653
Nose!
Nose!

501
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:13,162
- Here.
- There goes the nose.

502
01:01:14,459 --> 01:01:17,669
He is looking fat, guys.

503
01:01:18,453 --> 01:01:22,884
Did you teach them how to throw
snowballs coz they can't even hit me.

504
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:27,797
I can defeat you!

505
01:01:27,883 --> 01:01:31,286
Maybe I should give you the mask.

506
01:01:31,471 --> 01:01:35,300
- Oh come on.
- Issy, are you okay?

507
01:01:35,386 --> 01:01:38,453
- Issy?
- Are you okay?

508
01:01:38,539 --> 01:01:42,389
- Grace?
- Sucker! Sucker!

509
01:01:42,475 --> 01:01:45,764
Get him! Get him!

510
01:01:49,712 --> 01:01:51,303
Hello.

511
01:01:51,389 --> 01:01:54,377
Yes, this is she.

512
01:01:54,463 --> 01:02:00,301
You see this cheater player over here, huh.
Come on, you freaked me out.

513
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:11,939
What?

514
01:02:34,897 --> 01:02:36,281
What's going on?

515
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:42,361
- Uncle Tommy she grabbed me hair.
- I'm sorry, I wanna keep playing.

516
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:00,300
- Can I go out?
- Not yet.

517
01:03:00,386 --> 01:03:05,587
- Why?
- Coz we have to be patient.

518
01:03:06,933 --> 01:03:10,511
- Sir.
- Welcome home, Sam.

519
01:03:19,418 --> 01:03:21,163
Daddy!

520
01:03:21,249 --> 01:03:26,021
- We miss you so much.
- I miss you too.

521
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:29,217
My babies.

522
01:03:59,446 --> 01:04:02,705
- Don't cry.
- I love crying.

523
01:04:09,647 --> 01:04:12,909
Let me take a picture.

524
01:04:22,273 --> 01:04:27,015
Come on, come on, hurry.
Do you like it? Do you like it?

525
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:32,649
- It's amazing.
- I think he likes it.

526
01:04:32,742 --> 01:04:33,990
- Who did it?
- Me.

527
01:04:34,076 --> 01:04:36,173
- You did.
- And Uncle Tommy.

528
01:04:36,259 --> 01:04:40,104
Uncle Tommy and three amigos.

529
01:05:05,225 --> 01:05:07,944
Are you tired, honey?

530
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:13,914
- Come get in bed, everyone.
- This is fun.

531
01:05:15,322 --> 01:05:18,088
- We missed you, daddy.
- Me too.

532
01:05:19,074 --> 01:05:21,189
My girls.

533
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:25,052
And it's all so right.

534
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:37,935
Can I get up, mom?

535
01:05:38,038 --> 01:05:41,399
Dad, it's not bedtime.

536
01:05:54,086 --> 01:05:57,402
I locked that door.

537
01:05:57,661 --> 01:06:00,700
It's broken.

538
01:06:17,282 --> 01:06:20,630
I'm just gonna finish shaving.

539
01:06:35,396 --> 01:06:40,567
"Hero's Body Comes Home"

540
01:06:49,124 --> 01:06:52,347
- Banged up a little, huh.
- Yeah.

541
01:06:56,404 --> 01:07:00,458
Can't you take that down to the mechanic?

542
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:04,195
Yeah, I got...

543
01:07:04,281 --> 01:07:07,572
nothing else to do.

544
01:07:08,533 --> 01:07:11,723
Are you okay?

545
01:07:12,034 --> 01:07:14,563
Yeah.

546
01:07:18,397 --> 01:07:26,868
Is that...After I got back from 'Nam
you know, I can't talk to your mother.

547
01:07:27,696 --> 01:07:32,849
I guess I...take it out on you and Tommy.

548
01:07:32,935 --> 01:07:36,058
I don't know why.

549
01:07:37,449 --> 01:07:43,576
If you ever wanna talk
let me know.

550
01:08:07,408 --> 01:08:11,502
Are you okay?

551
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:15,147
You're good.

552
01:08:15,233 --> 01:08:18,374
Better than I thought.

553
01:08:18,746 --> 01:08:22,267
You look good out there with them.

554
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:33,744
Thanks for taking care of them.

555
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:38,331
- I didn't expect that.
- It comes natural, you know.

556
01:08:42,973 --> 01:08:46,341
It makes me start to think, you know.

557
01:08:53,603 --> 01:08:56,948
Grace is something, huh.

558
01:08:59,215 --> 01:09:02,520
Did you fuck her?

559
01:09:04,172 --> 01:09:07,602
What, are you kidding?

560
01:09:07,688 --> 01:09:11,092
I'd understand.

561
01:09:11,253 --> 01:09:15,606
- You thought I was dead.
- Stop it.

562
01:09:15,692 --> 01:09:18,242
Tommy.

563
01:09:18,431 --> 01:09:21,825
I could forgive you.

564
01:09:30,204 --> 01:09:33,468
What's going on with your head?

565
01:09:33,554 --> 01:09:36,869
What's making you think that?

566
01:09:40,288 --> 01:09:46,572
You guys just look like
two teenagers in love out there.

567
01:09:46,691 --> 01:09:49,056
Really.

568
01:09:49,142 --> 01:09:54,657
I mean, you know...
You can't deny that.

569
01:10:09,029 --> 01:10:12,024
You can tell me.

570
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:15,332
You gotta tell me, you understand?

571
01:10:15,418 --> 01:10:18,508
- I know you slept at my house.
- Sam... Sam...

572
01:10:18,909 --> 01:10:22,812
Don't bullshit me.

573
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:40,925
Joe Jr., come back.

574
01:10:41,311 --> 01:10:44,562
Cassie, it's fine.

575
01:10:44,734 --> 01:10:49,030
Ever since his dad died I can't
let him out of my sight.

576
01:10:49,726 --> 01:10:53,069
Look at him!
He's got a mind of his own.

577
01:10:53,155 --> 01:10:57,957
I had this nightmare where
Joe was looking up at me.

578
01:10:58,043 --> 01:11:01,745
And he's trying to tell me something.
He's trying to talk to me.

579
01:11:01,831 --> 01:11:07,596
His teeth just fall out off
his mouth and there's blood...

580
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:12,978
and I'm scrabbling around picking them up.

581
01:11:13,064 --> 01:11:17,588
And then last night,
your husband was there...

582
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:22,067
and he looks at my hand and he takes
my hand and looks at my wedding ring
and he just smiles at me.

583
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:27,379
- Did he say anything?
- No, he just smiled.

584
01:11:29,091 --> 01:11:31,192
But I hated him.

585
01:11:31,278 --> 01:11:35,481
In the dream, I hated
him for being alive.

586
01:11:35,772 --> 01:11:40,155
That's why I came over
to apologize, I'm sorry.

587
01:11:40,241 --> 01:11:44,785
I'm sick of feeling like this
all the time I wanna forgive them.

588
01:11:44,871 --> 01:11:47,990
I wanna be able to forgive them.

589
01:11:51,835 --> 01:11:54,742
For Joe Jr....

590
01:11:54,828 --> 01:11:56,807
He knows.

591
01:11:56,893 --> 01:12:01,257
He's just like his daddy who
knows exactly what I'm thinking.

592
01:12:06,801 --> 01:12:10,118
Where are you going, huh?

593
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:15,433
- Sam.
- Hi.

594
01:12:15,862 --> 01:12:19,068
Did you see him die?

595
01:12:21,678 --> 01:12:23,662
No.

596
01:12:23,748 --> 01:12:26,350
Did you hear anything?

597
01:12:26,436 --> 01:12:29,500
Was he on his own?

598
01:12:29,826 --> 01:12:33,326
He was brave.
I know that.

599
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:39,925
That's Captain Cahill.
He was friends with your daddy.

600
01:12:45,495 --> 01:12:47,372
You're a good man.

601
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:52,402
Oh baby, where are
you going? Come here.

602
01:14:23,304 --> 01:14:27,110
- Sir, Captain Cahill.
- Turn him in.

603
01:14:27,447 --> 01:14:30,612
I wanna go back sir.

604
01:14:30,698 --> 01:14:33,542
I'm ready.
I need to see my men.

605
01:14:33,628 --> 01:14:36,192
How's the counseling going?

606
01:14:36,278 --> 01:14:38,969
Yeah, Sir Thompson...

607
01:14:39,055 --> 01:14:42,811
everything pretty good there and...

608
01:14:42,907 --> 01:14:46,087
you know I'm just thinking about my men.

609
01:14:46,173 --> 01:14:49,772
- I wanna get back.
- That's good.

610
01:14:50,595 --> 01:14:53,935
How's your family?

611
01:14:55,776 --> 01:14:59,710
- I can't be there sir.
- Yeah?

612
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:04,511
They don't understand.

613
01:15:05,345 --> 01:15:09,268
I mean, nobody understands.

614
01:15:10,028 --> 01:15:16,699
It's gonna take a little time, Sam.
You've been through a lot of shit.

615
01:15:16,785 --> 01:15:19,195
So as your family.

616
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,248
I don't mind Bryan.

617
01:15:21,334 --> 01:15:25,436
He never hits people.
Only the boys, that is. Not the girls.

618
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:27,313
- That is nice.
- Yeah.

619
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:32,083
And he has a dog with really big ears.
I can't remember his name though.

620
01:15:32,169 --> 01:15:35,443
Elephant?

621
01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:42,399
- Elephant's not a dog.
- I know that elephant's not a dog.

622
01:15:42,485 --> 01:15:43,843
Then why'd you say it?

623
01:15:43,929 --> 01:15:48,645
Because elephants have big ears
and so does his dog.

624
01:15:48,731 --> 01:15:51,256
So...

625
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:53,609
Big ears.

626
01:15:53,695 --> 01:15:57,054
- Get it?
- It's really funny if you think about it, Dad.

627
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:00,990
- Sam, relax.
- But how's that funny?

628
01:16:01,384 --> 01:16:04,562
Big ears.

629
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:19,597
Is Dad okay, Mom?

630
01:16:19,683 --> 01:16:23,501
Yeah, of course.

631
01:16:23,764 --> 01:16:27,563
- When is Uncle Tommy coming?
- He's coming soon, sweetie.

632
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:31,227
Okay?
He wants to play with you.

633
01:16:33,033 --> 01:16:37,142
- I'm gonna check...check on daddy, okay.
- Okay.

634
01:16:49,743 --> 01:16:52,517
Sammy, what happened?

635
01:16:52,603 --> 01:16:54,896
What's going on?

636
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:58,235
Talk to me.

637
01:16:58,321 --> 01:17:01,363
What happened?

638
01:17:01,449 --> 01:17:04,794
What did they do to you?

639
01:17:05,112 --> 01:17:08,663
What happened with you and Tommy?

640
01:17:20,956 --> 01:17:24,439
We kissed, that's it.

641
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:31,589
I missed you. I thought you were dead.

642
01:17:31,675 --> 01:17:38,746
I couldn't get out of bed.
That's it.

643
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:47,462
Are you telling me the truth?

644
01:17:47,548 --> 01:17:50,831
You know.

645
01:17:54,478 --> 01:17:57,678
Now, tell me...

646
01:18:14,416 --> 01:18:19,279
- I think you're fucking Tommy.
- Oh, Sam...

647
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:09,868
Hey, come on, come on.
Faster, faster.

648
01:19:12,599 --> 01:19:15,979
Why did you stop pulling?

649
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:17,953
Hey!

650
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:22,890
Are you girls playing?

651
01:19:26,254 --> 01:19:29,308
What's wrong?

652
01:19:34,602 --> 01:19:37,420
It's okay.

653
01:19:40,793 --> 01:19:44,036
I was just confused.

654
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:48,964
It's gonna be okay.

655
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:52,690
Come here!
Give me a hug.

656
01:19:52,841 --> 01:19:54,878
Now...

657
01:19:54,964 --> 01:19:58,272
those are my girls.

658
01:20:04,262 --> 01:20:07,748
Why did the girl blushed
when she opened the refrigerator?

659
01:20:07,834 --> 01:20:11,943
She saw the "salad dressing".

660
01:20:12,029 --> 01:20:14,995
Have I told you guys that one?

661
01:20:15,081 --> 01:20:19,135
- A thousand times.
- It's still funny, though.

662
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:26,567
Have fun.

663
01:20:49,923 --> 01:20:52,137
Where have you been?

664
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:54,854
I was...

665
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:58,155
I was outside.

666
01:20:59,665 --> 01:21:02,591
Thinking...

667
01:21:02,677 --> 01:21:05,286
and...

668
01:21:11,069 --> 01:21:14,027
I was just thinking about you...

669
01:21:14,113 --> 01:21:17,493
and the kids and...

670
01:21:17,722 --> 01:21:21,136
the sun came up and I thought...

671
01:21:21,222 --> 01:21:24,646
I'm so lucky to be alive.

672
01:21:44,509 --> 01:21:46,968
We're gonna be late!

673
01:21:47,054 --> 01:21:49,071
- Come on!
- Do you have a spelling test today?

674
01:21:49,157 --> 01:21:53,647
Come on, grandpa.
It's my birthday. It's my birthday!

675
01:21:57,753 --> 01:22:01,686
Can I open my present now?
Please.

676
01:22:01,787 --> 01:22:03,961
- I think we should wait.
- Wait for Uncle Tommy.

677
01:22:04,047 --> 01:22:07,417
- Pretty please!
- Let her open just one.

678
01:22:07,503 --> 01:22:10,358
- It wouldn't hurt.
- You can open grandpa’s.

679
01:22:10,444 --> 01:22:13,506
- Thank you.
- Just one.

680
01:22:13,592 --> 01:22:16,155
- Okay, mom.
- Let me show you which it is.

681
01:22:16,241 --> 01:22:18,658
Is it the big one?

682
01:22:18,744 --> 01:22:22,051
- It's Uncle Tommy.
- Lucky guess.

683
01:22:27,432 --> 01:22:28,896
Issy.

684
01:22:28,963 --> 01:22:30,654
- Hey.
- Hey.

685
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:35,441
What's the matter?

686
01:22:35,678 --> 01:22:38,867
Is she okay?

687
01:22:38,953 --> 01:22:41,763
- Oh Grace, this is Tina.
- Hi, I am Tina.

688
01:22:41,849 --> 01:22:44,557
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my brother's wife, Grace.

689
01:22:44,643 --> 01:22:48,095
We're all in the dining room.

690
01:22:48,817 --> 01:22:52,600
Oh my God, she's so pretty.

691
01:23:00,965 --> 01:23:02,826
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

692
01:23:02,912 --> 01:23:05,779
This is Tina.

693
01:23:05,865 --> 01:23:08,871
She's an old friend.

694
01:23:08,957 --> 01:23:15,670
- Actually, we just met an hour ago.
- Yeah, I think an hour and a half.

695
01:23:16,893 --> 01:23:20,231
You got quite a charmer here.

696
01:23:20,419 --> 01:23:31,289
He's hiding inside that shell
putting its head in the shell
and its arms and legs.

697
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:36,211
And when the thing that's
scaring him goes like this...

698
01:23:36,451 --> 01:23:39,849
The turtle doesn't come out so the...

699
01:23:39,935 --> 01:23:45,546
thing that scares the turtle
goes away coz it thinks it's a rock.

700
01:23:45,632 --> 01:23:47,459
- You are a smart girl.
- Happy Birthday.

701
01:23:47,545 --> 01:23:50,749
Yes, you are.

702
01:23:51,896 --> 01:23:54,663
- Be careful.
- Everyone needs some reassurance.

703
01:23:54,749 --> 01:23:57,702
- Everyone's different, dad, you know.
- Stop playing with your cake.

704
01:23:57,788 --> 01:24:01,480
- What do you mean?
- I just think it's necessary that...

705
01:24:01,884 --> 01:24:06,098
- everybody has someone to listen to them.
- Well, you know, these days...

706
01:24:06,184 --> 01:24:08,460
they need therapy if they stab their toe.

707
01:24:08,546 --> 01:24:12,639
These guys are marines,
they're trained for it.

708
01:24:12,725 --> 01:24:17,286
They're marines but they're still people and...

709
01:24:19,655 --> 01:24:21,956
I don't think that anybody
is trained to shoot somebody.

710
01:24:22,042 --> 01:24:26,743
- What do you think they are trained for?
- I think that they're...what?

711
01:24:26,829 --> 01:24:29,780
- They're trained to use deadly force.
- Trained to kill.

712
01:24:29,866 --> 01:24:33,663
But nobody can really be
trained to watch someone die.

713
01:24:33,749 --> 01:24:37,537
- Just something that, not taught.
- Hey.

714
01:24:40,311 --> 01:24:42,962
Isabelle.

715
01:24:43,535 --> 01:24:47,318
- Let it go.
- Thank you.

716
01:24:47,404 --> 01:24:49,893
So what do you do?

717
01:24:49,979 --> 01:24:55,372
- I...I'm gonna be a nurse.
I'm in nursing school.
- Give it. Give it.

718
01:24:55,955 --> 01:24:59,056
- Dad!
- Isabelle.

719
01:24:59,142 --> 01:25:01,595
- That's my kitty.
- You're a nurse?

720
01:25:01,681 --> 01:25:06,359
- I'm a nurse, sir. You need a nurse?
- No, that won't do.

721
01:25:06,445 --> 01:25:08,875
Maggie gets everything.

722
01:25:08,961 --> 01:25:11,872
- She got the best doll.
- It's her birthday, honey.

723
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:16,035
I didn't get anything that
I wanted in my birthday.

724
01:25:16,597 --> 01:25:20,372
And you're in stupid Afghanistan.

725
01:25:24,394 --> 01:25:26,887
Nursing.
How's nursing been for you, Tina?

726
01:25:26,973 --> 01:25:33,611
It's been a challenge.
My stepfather actually encouraged me.

727
01:25:33,891 --> 01:25:36,200
Where did you grow up, Tina?

728
01:25:36,286 --> 01:25:40,742
Just 20 miles south,
actually I've never really left.

729
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:42,443
I'm gonna change that though.

730
01:25:42,529 --> 01:25:49,430
I'm moving at home right now.
It's kind of my home because nobody
else is really there most of the time.

731
01:25:49,516 --> 01:25:53,561
That's good to help me
save money for school and stuff.

732
01:25:53,647 --> 01:25:57,248
- An R.N.
- An R.N., yeah.

733
01:25:57,334 --> 01:26:00,658
I have another year to go,
but hopefully my grades...

734
01:26:00,744 --> 01:26:02,510
Isabelle, we're trying to
listen to our guest alright.

735
01:26:02,696 --> 01:26:04,784
So you're in 8-hour shifts, 12-hour?

736
01:26:04,870 --> 01:26:08,196
Now, I am praying for 12-hour shift.
I have to get...

737
01:26:08,282 --> 01:26:12,324
- For the money?
- Student loans are killing me.

738
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:15,124
I don't know how anyone does it.
How did they do it?

739
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:18,277
Isabelle.

740
01:26:20,444 --> 01:26:23,994
- Stop it.
- What got you into it?

741
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:29,603
I genuinely like people and I grew up...

742
01:26:30,422 --> 01:26:33,477
Enough!

743
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,103
- Couldn't you just stay dead?
- Isabelle!

744
01:26:37,189 --> 01:26:40,626
You're just mad coz mom rather
sleep with Uncle Tommy than you.

745
01:26:40,712 --> 01:26:42,456
Isabelle!
Why would she say that?

746
01:26:42,542 --> 01:26:47,270
- Mom and Uncle Tommy have sex all the time.
- Enough!

747
01:27:12,289 --> 01:27:15,243
Can I go home now?

748
01:27:15,329 --> 01:27:18,725
I wanna go to bed.

749
01:27:37,302 --> 01:27:40,508
Sorry, mom.

750
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:50,107
Why did you say that?
You know it's not true.

751
01:27:51,594 --> 01:27:54,838
I don't like Dad.

752
01:27:55,479 --> 01:28:01,102
I'd rather have Uncle Tommy around instead of Dad.

753
01:28:01,659 --> 01:28:04,801
Me too.

754
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:09,934
Daddy's gonna be better okay.

755
01:28:10,052 --> 01:28:13,682
- Really?
- Yeah.

756
01:28:14,945 --> 01:28:18,061
Thanks, mom.

757
01:28:19,955 --> 01:28:24,751
- Mom, I love you.
- I love you, baby.

758
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:52,798
Elsie, I don't know what he's gonna do.

759
01:28:55,152 --> 01:28:57,398
Where are you going?

760
01:28:59,571 --> 01:29:03,102
It's none of your damn business, you know.

761
01:29:04,049 --> 01:29:07,178
Just stay the hell out of it!

762
01:29:07,264 --> 01:29:10,707
You gotta call the police, Hank.

763
01:29:21,213 --> 01:29:24,232
What is that?

764
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:30,838
- Where are the kids?
- In bed.

765
01:29:32,579 --> 01:29:36,166
- They're all tucked in.
- Yeah.

766
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:39,638
Say their prayers.

767
01:29:47,449 --> 01:29:49,878
Sam.

768
01:29:49,964 --> 01:29:52,495
Sam.

769
01:29:53,344 --> 01:29:57,212
What am I supposed to do now, Grace?

770
01:30:16,554 --> 01:30:20,020
You know what I did to get back to you?

771
01:30:20,106 --> 01:30:22,973
- No.
- You know what I did!?

772
01:30:23,059 --> 01:30:28,235
To fucking get back to you!

773
01:30:29,413 --> 01:30:34,601
You know how he fucking suffered!
He fucking suffered because of you!

774
01:30:34,687 --> 01:30:39,069
And what is he doing with my fucking house
and my fucking kids, Grace?

775
01:30:39,155 --> 01:30:41,938
- You're fucking my brother!
- Sam, you know I didn't.

776
01:30:42,024 --> 01:30:44,553
You're fucking my brother
in my fucking house!

777
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:46,627
- Sam, please.
- I love you, Grace!

778
01:30:46,713 --> 01:30:50,426
- The girls, please.
- You know how much I love you!?

779
01:30:50,512 --> 01:30:52,553
You know what I...

780
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:55,805
Grace, do you know what I fucking...

781
01:30:55,891 --> 01:30:59,677
You know what I can do with
these fucking hands, Grace?

782
01:30:59,763 --> 01:31:03,185
Fuck!

783
01:31:05,428 --> 01:31:08,898
Fuck!

784
01:31:11,362 --> 01:31:14,849
What are you doing here?

785
01:31:29,338 --> 01:31:32,299
Come here, man.

786
01:31:49,168 --> 01:31:50,662
What the fuck are you doing here?

787
01:31:50,753 --> 01:31:52,140
Go in the room.

788
01:31:52,317 --> 01:31:54,359
- Fuck, fuck!
- Don't shoot me.

789
01:31:54,526 --> 01:31:56,876
- What the fuck did you do, motherfucker!?
- Don't lock the door.

790
01:31:56,962 --> 01:32:00,367
Going behind my bare back!

791
01:32:00,885 --> 01:32:02,858
- You called the cops.
- No.

792
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:06,717
You called the fucking cops.

793
01:32:19,277 --> 01:32:22,671
Is there a disturbance?

794
01:32:24,207 --> 01:32:26,356
Hold back!

795
01:32:26,442 --> 01:32:28,900
- What are you doing here?
- Drop your weapon!

796
01:32:28,986 --> 01:32:30,970
- What are you doing?
- Hold up. Put your gun down.

797
01:32:31,056 --> 01:32:33,498
- Tommy, get back in the house.
- What are you doing?

798
01:32:33,584 --> 01:32:36,071
Hold on, officers.
Calm down, captain.

799
01:32:36,157 --> 01:32:39,604
- Do you know me?
- Hey you shut up, okay?

800
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:43,164
- Stay back!
- Hey! Hey! Alright.

801
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:47,527
- You're a war hero, sir.
- I'm no fucking hero! I'm no fucking hero!

802
01:32:47,613 --> 01:32:49,583
- You know what I've done!?
- Hey, it's alright!

803
01:32:49,669 --> 01:32:51,409
- Just relax!
- Sam!

804
01:32:51,495 --> 01:32:54,500
- Put the gun down.
- What are you gonna do?

805
01:32:54,786 --> 01:32:58,170
- You're gonna shoot me.
- Calm down.

806
01:32:58,256 --> 01:33:00,220
- Hold your fire!
- Shoot me!

807
01:33:00,621 --> 01:33:02,031
Shoot me, come on!

808
01:33:02,117 --> 01:33:04,986
Shut the fuck up!
This is a family matter!

809
01:33:05,072 --> 01:33:08,414
Shut up! Shut up!
He is my brother.
Just stop for a second.

810
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,062
- Put the gun down sir!
- Just let me talk to him, he is my brother.

811
01:33:11,126 --> 01:33:11,953
Give him a minute.

812
01:33:17,251 --> 01:33:21,501
- Sam!
- You are my brother, Sam!

813
01:33:21,949 --> 01:33:23,213
Sam!

814
01:33:25,559 --> 01:33:28,377
Don't kill yourself.

815
01:33:28,463 --> 01:33:31,911
Sam!
One second.

816
01:33:32,248 --> 01:33:35,550
You're my brother.

817
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:39,110
You're my family.

818
01:33:40,504 --> 01:33:43,729
You hear me?

819
01:33:44,551 --> 01:33:47,091
Sam!

820
01:34:03,999 --> 01:34:07,149
What's going on, Sam?

821
01:34:07,819 --> 01:34:10,961
I'm drowning, Tommy.

822
01:34:15,929 --> 01:34:18,553
- Go! Go! Go!
- Get on the ground!

823
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,413
- Get on the ground now!
- Gun's here! Get down!

824
01:34:20,599 --> 01:34:24,505
Get down!
Give me your hand.

825
01:34:26,062 --> 01:34:30,369
On your knees!

826
01:34:31,367 --> 01:34:34,472
Get him up.

827
01:36:12,117 --> 01:36:15,173
My darling Grace.

828
01:36:15,715 --> 01:36:22,025
If you're reading this,
it means I didn't make it back.

829
01:36:22,155 --> 01:36:26,031
Nothing is certain in this life.

830
01:36:26,175 --> 01:36:30,628
The only thing I know for sure
is that I love you...

831
01:36:30,714 --> 01:36:34,030
and our girls.

832
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:37,754
That is the only
thing I know.

833
01:36:45,687 --> 01:36:48,591
- Hello.
- Hey, Tommy.

834
01:36:48,677 --> 01:36:51,977
- Sam here.
- Hey.

835
01:36:55,805 --> 01:37:04,424
- I was just...thinking about you.
- Are you alright?

836
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:07,974
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm just calling...

837
01:37:09,529 --> 01:37:10,531
you know...

838
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:17,323
you're my brother, Tommy.

839
01:37:30,474 --> 01:37:33,886
When's your birthday, Uncle Tommy?

840
01:37:56,043 --> 01:38:00,775
Okay sir, you know the drill.
See in about thirty minutes.

841
01:38:32,113 --> 01:38:36,340
Sam, tell me what happened.

842
01:38:42,171 --> 01:38:44,724
Sam.

843
01:38:45,269 --> 01:38:48,748
What happened?

844
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:54,085
Why are you punishing yourself?

845
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:11,172
I've loved you since
I was sixteen years old.

846
01:39:11,258 --> 01:39:12,996
You know that?

847
01:39:13,082 --> 01:39:18,334
If you won't tell me what happened,
you're not gonna see me again.

848
01:39:41,944 --> 01:39:45,079
I killed him.

849
01:39:50,365 --> 01:39:53,969
I killed Joe Willis.

850
01:40:05,723 --> 01:40:11,726
I don't know who said,
"Only the dead had seen the end of war."

851
01:40:12,291 --> 01:40:16,151
I have seen the end of war.

852
01:40:16,815 --> 01:40:20,087
The question is...

853
01:40:21,812 --> 01:40:25,284
Can I live again?
