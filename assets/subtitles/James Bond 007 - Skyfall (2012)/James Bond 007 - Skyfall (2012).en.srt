2
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:22,219
Ron is down.

3
00:01:23,103 --> 00:01:24,834
He needs a medical evac.

4
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:26,426
Where is it? Is it there?

5
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:28,754
- Oh, the drive is gone.
- Are you sure?

6
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:34,606
It's gone.
Give me a minute.

7
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,935
They must have it.
Get off to them.

8
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:43,960
- I'm stabilizing Ronson.
- We don't have the time.

9
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,164
- I have to stop the bleeding.
- Leave him!

10
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:23,695
Have you got him?

11
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:25,984
He is in the black Audi.

12
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,953
- What about Ronson.
- He's been hit.

13
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:30,722
I'm sending an emergency
evacuation squad.

14
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:33,078
They'll be too bloody late.

15
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:35,146
Have they seen us?

16
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,383
Medical Evac for Ronson,
five minutes away.

17
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:46,920
It's alright?
You'll wait using it.

18
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,383
I wasn't using that one either.

19
00:03:36,058 --> 00:03:37,539
Keep your head down!

20
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:13,515
Just get clear!

21
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,805
Tanner, which way?

22
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:18,793
Keep going.
I can direct you from here.

23
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,110
We both know what's at stake here.

24
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,283
We can't afford to lose that list.

25
00:04:22,374 --> 00:04:23,649
Yes, ma'am.

26
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:54,119
Where are they now?

27
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:57,072
They're on the top roof
of the Grand Bazaar.

28
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,437
Take the left, there's a bridge.
You can cut him off.

29
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:45,415
- What happened?
- They're on the train, ma' am.

30
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:46,377
What do you mean on the train?

31
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:47,937
I mean they're on the top
of the train.

32
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:50,141
Well, get off to them, for God's sake.

33
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,016
He's going out of range.

34
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,588
We've lost tracking.
We are blind here.

35
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,353
- What's going on?
- I'm still with them.

36
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:26,901
Skip to satellite TV.

37
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:17,930
What was that?

38
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,675
VW Beetles, I think.

39
00:08:47,756 --> 00:08:49,702
He's un-coupling the cars.

40
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:30,966
- 007, are you alright?
- Just changing carriages.

41
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,967
What's going on? Report!

42
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:35,947
It's rather hard to explain, ma'am.

43
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:38,504
007 is the follow-up.

44
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:46,312
This side there isn't much more road.
I don't think I can go any further.

45
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:23,043
I may have a shot.

46
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:30,859
It's not clean.

47
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:33,551
Repeat. I did not have a clean shot.

48
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:42,417
There's a tunnel ahead.
I'm gonna lose them.

49
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:45,793
- Can you get into a better position?
- Negative. There's no time.

50
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,850
Take the shot.

51
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:52,488
I said, "Take the shot!"

52
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:55,809
I can't. I may get Bond.

53
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,551
Take the bloody shot.

54
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,750
Agent down.

55
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:42,128
It's like being summoned
into the headmaster study.

56
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,381
It's the new chairman.
Just standard procedure.

57
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:47,080
Bloody waste of my time,
that's what I'd call it.

58
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:49,009
I'm sorry to have deal with such...

59
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:50,884
a delicate subject
at our first encounter...

60
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:55,051
but...

61
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,137
I have to be frank with you.

62
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:00,467
And it would be a good idea.

63
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:04,462
The Prime Minister is concerned.

64
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,467
You can tell him my operatives
are pursuing every avenue.

65
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:10,308
Have you considered
pulling out the agents?

66
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:11,792
I've considered every option.

67
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:14,061
Forgive me,
but that sounds like an evasion.

68
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,417
Forgive me, but why am I here?

69
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:20,384
Three months ago
you lost the computer drive

70
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,317
containing the identity
of almost every NATO agent

71
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:26,710
embedded in terrorist organizations
across the globe.

72
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:29,434
A list which,
in the eyes of our allies,

73
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,702
never existed.

74
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:34,298
So, if you'll forgive me,
I think you know why we're here.

75
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:36,121
We are to call this civilian oversight?

76
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:38,255
No, what we are to call this is...

77
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:40,425
a retirement planning.

78
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:43,763
Your country has
the highest respect for you

79
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:45,782
and your many years of service.

80
00:18:45,904 --> 00:18:47,445
When your current posting
is completed,

81
00:18:47,572 --> 00:18:49,826
you'll be awarded to JCMG

82
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:51,549
with full honors.

83
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,228
Congratulations.

84
00:18:55,096 --> 00:18:56,237
You are firing me?

85
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,380
No, ma'am, I'm here to oversee
the transition period...

86
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:01,617
leading to your voluntary retirement
in two months' time.

87
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:04,151
Your successor has yet to be appointed,
so we'll be asking you...

88
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:06,016
I'm not an idiot, Mallory.

89
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:08,563
I know I can't do this job forever.

90
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:11,065
But I'll be damned if I'm going
to leave the department

91
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:13,234
in worst shape than I found it.

92
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:16,137
M... you've had a great run.

93
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:19,551
- You should leave with dignity.
- Go to hell with dignity.

94
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:23,383
I'll leave when the job's done.

95
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:41,422
Yes?

96
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,729
Now?

97
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:47,697
Main alert from Q Robson,

98
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:50,381
He's trying to decrypt
the stolen hard drive.

99
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:53,092
We are tracing the encryption signal.

100
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:54,703
Localizing now.

101
00:19:57,092 --> 00:20:00,342
It's sent from here in the UK.

102
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,230
London.

103
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:05,057
Get us back to base
as soon as possible.

104
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:14,057
- It's coming from MI6.
- What?

105
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:17,092
The data back,
it is linking to our network.

106
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:19,608
This is behind our firewall.

107
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:22,403
- We should shut down.
- No, track it.

108
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:24,107
We have to know
where it's coming from.

109
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:26,636
Strip the header and trace the source.

110
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:28,527
How the hell did it get
into our system?

111
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:30,736
Getting trace right now.

112
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:41,299
- It is addressed to your computer, ma'am.
- Shut it down.

113
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:48,814
What is this?

114
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,829
For God's sake!

115
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:14,762
Just get out of the way.

116
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:17,532
- Don't you recognize the car?
- Madam...

117
00:24:42,677 --> 00:24:44,945
I will find who ever did this.

118
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:35,682
Where the hell have you been?

119
00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:39,482
Enjoying death.

120
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:43,008
007, reporting for duty.

121
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,627
Why didn't you call?

122
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:53,336
Didn't you get the postcard?

123
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:55,397
You should try it sometimes.

124
00:25:55,617 --> 00:25:58,330
Get away from it all,
it really lends perspective.

125
00:25:58,587 --> 00:26:01,055
Run out of drink.
Were you awarded?

126
00:26:01,105 --> 00:26:02,145
What was you said?

127
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:04,711
Take the bloody shot.

128
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,720
I made a judgment call.

129
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:09,192
You should have trusted me
to finish the job.

130
00:26:09,242 --> 00:26:10,667
It was the possibility
of losing you...

131
00:26:10,758 --> 00:26:13,702
or the certainty of losing
all those other agents.

132
00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:16,632
I made the only decision I could
and you know it.

133
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,036
I think you've lost your nerve.

134
00:26:19,227 --> 00:26:21,443
What do you expect,
a bloody apology?

135
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,984
You know the rules of the game.
You've been playing it long enough.

136
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:28,529
- We both have.
- Maybe too long.

137
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,820
Speak for yourself.

138
00:26:33,353 --> 00:26:35,130
Ronson didn't make it, did he?

139
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:37,430
No.

140
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:41,895
So, this is it.

141
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:44,144
We are both played out.

142
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,034
Well, if you believed that,
why did you come back?

143
00:26:48,288 --> 00:26:49,566
Good question.

144
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:52,834
Because we are under attack.

145
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:57,924
And you know we need you.

146
00:27:01,357 --> 00:27:02,646
Well, I'm here.

147
00:27:04,407 --> 00:27:05,486
You'll have to be debriefed

148
00:27:05,577 --> 00:27:07,423
and declared fit for active service.

149
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:11,509
You can only return to duty
when you've passed the tests.

150
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:12,750
So take them seriously.

151
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:15,819
The shower might be in order.

152
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,846
I'm going home and change.

153
00:27:18,895 --> 00:27:20,280
Oh, we sold your flat.

154
00:27:21,112 --> 00:27:22,715
Put your things in storage.

155
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:24,729
Standard procedure...

156
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:28,294
on the death of an unmarried
employee with no next of kin.

157
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:30,824
You should have called.

158
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:32,442
I'll find a hotel.

159
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:35,075
Well, you're bloody not sleeping here.

160
00:28:03,491 --> 00:28:05,865
The assailant hacked into the
environmental control system

161
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:09,128
locked out the safety protocols
and turned on the gas.

162
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:10,961
All of which should have been impossible.

163
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:13,557
On top of that they have hacked
into her files.

164
00:28:13,807 --> 00:28:14,938
They knew her appointments.

165
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:17,189
They knew she'd be out
of the building.

166
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,551
They weren't targeting her.

167
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,561
They wanted us to see it.

168
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:26,088
- Where are we, Tanner?
- New digs.

169
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:36,557
The old building was declared
strategically vulnerable.

170
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:38,826
That's putting it marvelly.

171
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:42,177
He was able to breach the most secure
computer system in Britain.

172
00:28:42,202 --> 00:28:44,557
So we are on war footing now.

173
00:28:45,144 --> 00:28:47,405
This is part of Churchill's bunker.

174
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:50,348
They are still discovering tunnels
dating back of the 18th century.

175
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:52,707
Quite fascinating,
if it wasn't for the rats.

176
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:55,549
- When do I see M?
- Tomorrow you'll see M...

177
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:58,515
and Mallory too if you're lucky.

178
00:28:58,565 --> 00:28:59,202
Who is Mallory?

179
00:28:59,382 --> 00:29:01,432
He's the chairman of Intelligence
and Security Committee.

180
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:04,717
A charming man. I think you and him
are really going to hit it off.

181
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,843
Welcome to the new MI6.

182
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:27,784
We've have attempted to trace
the computer message, but...

183
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,080
it was sent by an asymmetrical
security algorithm...

184
00:29:31,588 --> 00:29:32,961
which bounces the signal
all over the globe

185
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:35,201
through thousands
of different servers.

186
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:36,671
And now that they've accessed
M's code,

187
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:39,472
it's only a matter of time
before they are able to decrypt the list.

188
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:42,932
Q branch has been analyzing pictures,
but so far nothing.

189
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:45,281
General feeling it's probably
someone from her past.

190
00:29:45,574 --> 00:29:47,779
Perhaps when she was running
things in Hong Kong.

191
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:51,508
- He's no idea what it all means.
- And you believe that?

192
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,582
The truth is we don't have
a clue who took the list...

193
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:57,758
or what they plan to do with it.

194
00:30:03,523 --> 00:30:05,497
We can always do this later.

195
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:09,192
You know what? Let's.

196
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:18,212
I'd like to start with some
simple word associations.

197
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:20,894
Just tell me the first word
that pops into your head.

198
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,351
For example I might say "day",
and you might say...

199
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:25,374
Wasted.

200
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:30,759
All right.

201
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:36,097
Gun.

202
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:37,826
Shot.

203
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:39,912
- Agent.
- Provocateur.

204
00:31:40,621 --> 00:31:42,355
- Woman.
- Provocatrix.

205
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,480
- Heart.
- Target.

206
00:31:46,065 --> 00:31:48,366
- Bird.
- Sky.

207
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:50,670
- M.
- Bitch.

208
00:31:53,652 --> 00:31:55,703
- Sunlight.
- Swim.

209
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:57,439
- Moonlight.
- Dance.

210
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:00,423
- Murder.
- Employment.

211
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:02,394
- Country.
- England.

212
00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:04,411
Skyfall.

213
00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:11,125
Skyfall.

214
00:32:14,448 --> 00:32:16,692
Done.

215
00:32:21,887 --> 00:32:23,829
This is going well.

216
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:12,869
Get these analyzed.

217
00:33:14,153 --> 00:33:16,003
For her eyes only.

218
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:45,134
She's ready for you.

219
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:47,614
I'm sorry. Have we met before?

220
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,911
I am the one who should say "sorry".

221
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:54,933
It was only four ribs.

222
00:33:55,648 --> 00:33:57,522
That's nonetheless vital organs.

223
00:33:59,513 --> 00:34:01,530
Nothing major.

224
00:34:06,465 --> 00:34:08,114
No enough excitement in Istanbul?

225
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:09,610
I've been reassigned.

226
00:34:09,677 --> 00:34:11,972
Temporary suspension
from field work.

227
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:15,304
- Really?
- Something to do with killing 007.

228
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,130
- Well, you gave your best shot.
- It was hardly my best shot.

229
00:34:19,782 --> 00:34:21,500
I'm sure I can survive your best.

230
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,684
Perhaps you'll get the chance.

231
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,036
Would you do me a favor, will you?

232
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:27,164
If they'll do let you back out there,

233
00:34:28,382 --> 00:34:30,282
warn me first.

234
00:34:30,496 --> 00:34:33,081
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory
in the transition...

235
00:34:33,132 --> 00:34:35,331
and then I'll be back in the field.

236
00:34:35,536 --> 00:34:38,070
- That's what you want?
- Yes, of course.

237
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:41,342
- It's not for everyone.
- Ah, 007...

238
00:34:42,072 --> 00:34:43,510
This way.

239
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:45,092
In your defense...

240
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:48,134
a moving target
is much harder to hit.

241
00:34:49,317 --> 00:34:52,525
Then you better keep moving.

242
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:06,353
The whole office goes up in smoke
and that bloody thing survives.

243
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,764
Your interior decorating tips
have always been appreciated, 007.

244
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,376
007, Gareth Mallory.

245
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:16,822
I hope I haven't miss anything
the P.M.does place a lot in the crisis.

246
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:19,525
- Bond.
- Mallory.

247
00:35:24,364 --> 00:35:26,510
I have just been reviewing
Bond's tests.

248
00:35:27,155 --> 00:35:28,347
Seemed you passed. By the skin
of your teeth.

249
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:32,396
You're back on active service.

250
00:35:33,706 --> 00:35:36,255
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

251
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:40,483
- I'll be outside.
- I only have one question.

252
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:44,483
Why not stay dead?

253
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:46,951
You have the perfect way out.

254
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:48,670
Go and live quietly somewhere.

255
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:52,590
Not many field agents
get to leave this cleanly.

256
00:35:52,641 --> 00:35:54,543
Do you get out in the field much?

257
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:58,152
You don't need to be an operative
to see the obvious.

258
00:35:59,476 --> 00:36:01,248
It's a young men's game.

259
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:03,800
Look, you've been
seriously injured.

260
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:06,347
There's no shame in saying
you have lost a step.

261
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:09,579
The only shame it'd be not admitting
until it's too late.

262
00:36:10,614 --> 00:36:14,202
Hire me or fire me.
It's entirely up to you.

263
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,369
If he says he is ready,
he is ready.

264
00:36:17,606 --> 00:36:19,693
Perhaps you can't see at all.

265
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:20,521
Maybe you will.

266
00:36:20,572 --> 00:36:22,213
What exactly are you implying?

267
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:24,588
You are sentimental about it.

268
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:27,277
As long as I am at the head
of this department,

269
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:29,923
I'll choose my own operatives.

270
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,161
Fair enough.

271
00:36:37,588 --> 00:36:38,967
Good luck, 007.

272
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,496
Don't cock it up.

273
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,110
We've analyzed
the scharpnel fragments.

274
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,965
You're lucky it wasn't a direct hit.
It would have cut you in half.

275
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:58,313
It's a depleted uranium shell.
Military grade.

276
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,327
Hard to get,
extremely expensive

277
00:37:01,626 --> 00:37:05,092
and only used by a select few.

278
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,532
Recognize anyone?

279
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:09,563
Him.

280
00:37:10,514 --> 00:37:12,657
Okay, the name is Patrice.

281
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:13,677
He's a ghost.

282
00:37:13,728 --> 00:37:15,554
An unknown resident
or country of origin.

283
00:37:15,588 --> 00:37:17,144
How do we find him?

284
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:20,476
Well, luckily we stil have one or two
friends left in the CIA.

285
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:23,378
They're after him for the Yemeni
ambassador's murder.

286
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:24,659
And they're getting close.

287
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,737
Intel is he's gonna be in Shanghai
in two days time. Probably a new job.

288
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:31,313
You have to go there
and wait further instructions.

289
00:37:31,364 --> 00:37:33,335
If he turns up, it's yours.

290
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:36,646
Find out who he worked for
and who has the list.

291
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,431
- Then, terminate him for Ronson.
- With pleasure.

292
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:44,657
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

293
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:47,076
No.

294
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:49,987
Report to the new Quarter Master
for your documentation.

295
00:37:50,327 --> 00:37:53,885
He hasn't set up shop yet, but
Tanner will put you two together.

296
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:55,059
Good luck.

297
00:37:55,422 --> 00:37:56,827
Thank you.

298
00:38:00,501 --> 00:38:01,840
007...

299
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:05,460
You are ready for this?

300
00:38:06,728 --> 00:38:08,057
Yes, ma'am.

301
00:38:11,827 --> 00:38:13,221
I didn't know Bond passed the tests.

302
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,001
He didn't.

303
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,507
Always makes me feel
a little melancholy.

304
00:38:48,088 --> 00:38:52,168
A grand whole warship been hit
ominously all the way to scrap.

305
00:38:54,951 --> 00:38:57,617
Inevitability of time, don't you think?

306
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,318
What do you see?

307
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:04,972
A bloody big ship.

308
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:07,340
Excuse me.

309
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,965
007...

310
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:11,873
I'm your new Quarter Master.

311
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:15,653
You must be joking.

312
00:39:16,378 --> 00:39:18,123
Why, because I'm not wearing
a lab coat?

313
00:39:18,336 --> 00:39:20,594
Because you still have spots.

314
00:39:21,434 --> 00:39:23,135
My complexion is hardly relevant.

315
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,621
And your confidence is.

316
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:27,927
Age is no guarantee of efficiency.

317
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:30,440
And youth
is no guarantee of innovation.

318
00:39:31,364 --> 00:39:33,496
I can do more damage
on my laptop

319
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:36,393
sitting in my pyjamas before
my first cup of Old Grey

320
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,411
than you could do yourself
a year in the field.

321
00:39:38,436 --> 00:39:40,092
So why do you need me?

322
00:39:41,414 --> 00:39:43,675
Every now and then
a trigger has to be pulled.

323
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,293
Or not pulled.

324
00:39:46,797 --> 00:39:49,916
It is hard to know which
in your pyjamas.

325
00:39:53,282 --> 00:39:56,407
Q...

326
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:59,532
007.

327
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:03,032
Ticket to Shanghai.

328
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,282
- Documentation and passport.
- Thank you.

329
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:08,532
And this.

330
00:40:10,802 --> 00:40:13,554
Walter PPK, 9 mm short.

331
00:40:14,282 --> 00:40:16,429
There's a micro dermal sensor
in the grip...

332
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:20,293
encoded to your palm print,
so only you can fire it.

333
00:40:21,072 --> 00:40:24,632
That's a random killing machine
more than a personal statement.

334
00:40:25,282 --> 00:40:26,641
And this?

335
00:40:28,036 --> 00:40:30,492
Standard radio transmitter.

336
00:40:30,898 --> 00:40:33,860
Activated to broadcast
your location.

337
00:40:34,585 --> 00:40:35,827
Distress it.

338
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:40,492
And that's it.

339
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:44,626
A gun... and a radio.

340
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:48,657
Not exactly Christmas, isn't it?

341
00:40:49,766 --> 00:40:52,262
Were you expecting an exploding pen?

342
00:40:53,907 --> 00:40:56,065
We don't really go in
for that anymore.

343
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:05,563
Good luck out there on the field.

344
00:41:06,081 --> 00:41:08,954
And please,
return the equipment in one piece.

345
00:41:14,336 --> 00:41:16,047
Brave new world.

346
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,000
Who's got the list?

347
00:49:41,536 --> 00:49:41,947
Help me!

348
00:49:42,336 --> 00:49:43,347
Who are you working for?

349
00:51:14,496 --> 00:51:15,675
He has posted the first five names.

350
00:51:16,536 --> 00:51:20,121
Their cover is blown.
They're in danger. Get them out now.

351
00:51:59,371 --> 00:52:00,623
Room service.

352
00:52:09,717 --> 00:52:11,114
I didn't order anything.

353
00:52:11,635 --> 00:52:12,769
Not even you.

354
00:52:13,012 --> 00:52:14,639
I have got some new information.

355
00:52:15,721 --> 00:52:18,885
Are not you a little too qualified
to be delivering messages?

356
00:52:19,864 --> 00:52:21,996
It's all part of the learning curve.

357
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,371
And Q is afraid of flying.

358
00:52:26,896 --> 00:52:30,771
So, whoever stole the list
has already decrypted it.

359
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,889
They posted the first five names
on the web.

360
00:52:33,938 --> 00:52:37,326
- It was only a matter of time.
- That should be the start.

361
00:52:37,376 --> 00:52:40,713
They're posting five more next week
and the week after.

362
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:43,788
It's some kind of sadistic game.

363
00:52:48,572 --> 00:52:50,193
Cut through razor.

364
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:53,621
How very traditional.

365
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:57,985
All I like is to do something the
old-fashioned way.

366
00:53:00,297 --> 00:53:02,914
Sometimes the old ways
are the best.

367
00:53:13,492 --> 00:53:15,860
Are you putting your knife
in my hands again?

368
00:53:20,853 --> 00:53:23,168
They've already briefed me
on the list...

369
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:28,699
raising the tantalizing question
of what you are really doing here.

370
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:32,916
The official directive was to help...

371
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:37,699
in anyway I can.

372
00:53:37,862 --> 00:53:40,606
Like spying for Mallory.

373
00:53:42,315 --> 00:53:44,550
You know, Mallory is not as bad
as you think.

374
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:48,264
He is a bureaucrat.

375
00:53:48,822 --> 00:53:50,701
You should do your homework.

376
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:53,559
Gareth Mallory
was lieutenant colonel...

377
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,807
lieutenant colonel in Northern
Ireland Hereford regiment.

378
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:59,489
He spent three months
at the hands of the IRA.

379
00:54:01,043 --> 00:54:03,514
So there's more to him
that meets the eye.

380
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,144
We'll see.

381
00:54:09,851 --> 00:54:11,360
Keep still.

382
00:54:13,588 --> 00:54:16,184
This is the tricky part.

383
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,617
That's better.

384
00:54:30,472 --> 00:54:33,364
- You know the part now.
- Mmh, mmh.

385
00:54:35,394 --> 00:54:37,036
And what part is that?

386
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:40,570
Old dog...

387
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,885
new tricks.

388
00:55:55,409 --> 00:55:56,644
Good evening.

389
00:55:57,148 --> 00:55:58,369
Good evening.

390
00:55:58,418 --> 00:56:00,478
Don't you touch your ear.

391
00:56:01,563 --> 00:56:03,023
There are three exits.

392
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,344
And lots of blind spots.

393
00:56:07,195 --> 00:56:08,815
I've got them covered.

394
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,530
You look beautiful in that dress.

395
00:56:18,246 --> 00:56:21,353
It's amazing what one could do
with an extra pair of hands.

396
00:56:21,672 --> 00:56:23,262
You're telling me.

397
00:56:25,027 --> 00:56:26,088
You gamble?

398
00:56:26,608 --> 00:56:29,079
Don't you like a little flat
now and then?

399
00:56:31,063 --> 00:56:33,465
He doesn't like to take chances.

400
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,858
Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?

401
00:56:41,009 --> 00:56:42,775
I'd like to cash these, please.

402
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,367
One moment, sir.

403
00:57:23,826 --> 00:57:25,972
Good fortune tonight, sir.

404
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,260
Let's hope so.

405
00:57:42,092 --> 00:57:44,074
With compliments of the house.

406
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:46,534
Thank you.

407
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:08,639
Now you can afford to buy me a drink?

408
00:58:11,195 --> 00:58:13,715
Maybe I could even stretch it to two.

409
00:58:15,061 --> 00:58:17,393
I guess I've got 4 million euros
in here.

410
00:58:17,657 --> 00:58:19,226
Not bad.

411
00:58:19,251 --> 00:58:22,672
- I like this game.
- Why don't we play another?

412
00:58:23,811 --> 00:58:25,280
I don't gamble.

413
00:58:28,773 --> 00:58:30,438
I'm not very lucky.

414
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:33,282
With lucky old friend in Shanghai.

415
00:58:37,027 --> 00:58:40,146
I've been waiting to see
who will redeem for chips.

416
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:44,365
You made such a bold entrance
into our little drama.

417
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:46,666
Do I have a complicated plot?

418
00:58:47,797 --> 00:58:50,032
Who doesn't appreciate
the occasional twists?

419
00:58:50,498 --> 00:58:54,934
- Mr...
- Bond. James Bond.

420
00:58:55,443 --> 00:58:58,507
Severine, so Mr. Bond...

421
00:58:58,556 --> 00:59:01,974
shall we discuss your next
performance over that drink?

422
00:59:02,179 --> 00:59:03,740
Not bad.

423
00:59:06,527 --> 00:59:09,893
Will your friends be joining us?

424
00:59:10,684 --> 00:59:13,893
That I'm afraid... is inevitable.

425
00:59:17,322 --> 00:59:19,561
- She's pretty.
- No, no.

426
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:22,643
Do you like that ass, don't you think?

427
00:59:22,693 --> 00:59:24,164
I'll keep you posted.

428
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:37,085
Perfect.

429
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:42,103
Would you mind if I ask you
a business question?

430
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:46,398
Depends on the question.

431
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:49,110
It has to do with... death.

432
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:52,219
A subject in which you're well versed.

433
00:59:53,043 --> 00:59:55,048
How would you know that?

434
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:59,097
Only a certain kind of woman
wears a backless dress

435
00:59:59,123 --> 01:00:02,126
with a Beretta .70
strapped to her thigh.

436
01:00:02,748 --> 01:00:04,682
One could never be too careful when...

437
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:08,387
a handsome man in tuxedo
carries...

438
01:00:10,922 --> 01:00:13,851
I'm correct in assuming
you killed Patrice?

439
01:00:15,056 --> 01:00:16,237
Yes.

440
01:00:17,885 --> 01:00:19,731
Might I ask why?

441
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:23,179
I want to meet your employer.

442
01:00:35,271 --> 01:00:38,809
Be careful what you wish for.

443
01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:40,735
You are scared.

444
01:00:41,851 --> 01:00:43,878
Thank you for the drink...

445
01:00:45,543 --> 01:00:47,025
Mr. Bond.

446
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:56,632
You put on a good show.

447
01:00:58,961 --> 01:01:00,407
But ever since we sat down here

448
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:03,400
you haven't stop looking
at your bodyguards.

449
01:01:04,876 --> 01:01:07,135
Three of them is a bit excessive.

450
01:01:07,612 --> 01:01:09,324
They're controlling you.

451
01:01:09,817 --> 01:01:11,228
They're not protecting you.

452
01:01:13,414 --> 01:01:14,717
Tattoo on your wrist...

453
01:01:15,284 --> 01:01:16,719
is Macao's sex trade.

454
01:01:16,811 --> 01:01:19,876
You belong to one of the Houses.
At 12?

455
01:01:20,447 --> 01:01:22,039
13?

456
01:01:22,976 --> 01:01:24,989
I guess you're imaging a way out.

457
01:01:25,777 --> 01:01:28,376
Perhaps you thought you were in love.

458
01:01:29,742 --> 01:01:32,416
But that was a long time ago.

459
01:01:34,534 --> 01:01:36,579
You know nothing about it.

460
01:01:37,106 --> 01:01:40,568
I know when a woman is afraid
and pretending not to be.

461
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:45,757
How much do you know
about fear?

462
01:01:46,317 --> 01:01:48,572
All there is.

463
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:51,173
Not like this.

464
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:56,797
And... not like him.

465
01:01:56,847 --> 01:01:58,304
I can help you.

466
01:01:59,141 --> 01:02:01,907
- I don't think so.
- Let me try.

467
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,512
How?

468
01:02:06,547 --> 01:02:08,195
Bring me to him.

469
01:02:10,867 --> 01:02:14,525
- Can you kill him?
- Yes.

470
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:18,525
- Will you?
- Someone usually dies.

471
01:02:23,155 --> 01:02:26,525
Perhaps you can.

472
01:02:32,764 --> 01:02:34,773
When I leave,
they're going to kill you.

473
01:02:36,065 --> 01:02:38,762
If you survive, I'm on the Kimera.

474
01:02:39,242 --> 01:02:40,427
North Harbour...

475
01:02:41,282 --> 01:02:42,945
berth 7.

476
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:47,483
We cast off in an hour.

477
01:02:51,795 --> 01:02:54,199
Very nice to have met you,
Mr. Bond.

478
01:02:55,849 --> 01:02:57,257
Good luck.

479
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:24,742
Good luck with that.

480
01:04:48,934 --> 01:04:50,092
Thank you.

481
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:56,980
Put it all on red.

482
01:04:59,101 --> 01:05:01,425
That's the circle of life.

483
01:05:25,302 --> 01:05:26,635
Yes?

484
01:05:30,235 --> 01:05:33,318
It's time to cast off.

485
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:35,353
Right.

486
01:06:30,715 --> 01:06:33,228
I like you better without
your Beretta.

487
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:41,034
I feel naked without it.

488
01:06:56,411 --> 01:06:57,099
"Good evening."

489
01:06:57,224 --> 01:06:58,963
"The controversy surrounding
the Ministry of Defence..."

490
01:06:59,088 --> 01:07:00,541
"has escalated today"

491
01:07:00,788 --> 01:07:04,447
"as images of the Hussein
assassination continue to circulate."

492
01:07:04,704 --> 01:07:08,210
"We should warn you, some viewers
might find these images disturbing."

493
01:07:09,728 --> 01:07:13,157
"Captain Hussein, an MI6 operative
embedded in the Middle East"

494
01:07:13,365 --> 01:07:16,893
"was one of the five agents exposed
in what is now been considered"

495
01:07:17,168 --> 01:07:20,923
"the greatest internal security breach
in modern British history."

496
01:07:21,195 --> 01:07:24,820
"The Prime Minister continues
to express public support for MI6"

497
01:07:25,231 --> 01:07:27,170
"while the opposition has taken
the position..."

498
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:29,782
has taken the position where a bunch
of antiquate bloody idiots

499
01:07:29,934 --> 01:07:33,108
are fighting a war we don't understand
and can't possibly win.

500
01:07:33,565 --> 01:07:35,728
Look, three of my agents
are dead already.

501
01:07:35,887 --> 01:07:37,965
Don't you embroil me in politics now.

502
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,237
The Prime Minister has ordered
an enquiry.

503
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:40,804
You'll have to appear.

504
01:07:40,853 --> 01:07:44,353
Standing in the stocks of mid day?
Who is antiquated now?

505
01:07:44,378 --> 01:07:46,751
For Christ sake, listen to yourself.
We are a democracy...

506
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:49,077
and are accountable to the people
who are trying to defend.

507
01:07:49,101 --> 01:07:50,521
We can't keep working
in the shadows.

508
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:52,902
There are no more shadows.

509
01:07:52,927 --> 01:07:54,751
You don't get this, do you?

510
01:07:55,597 --> 01:07:58,496
Whoever is behind this,
whoever is doing this, he knows us.

511
01:07:59,188 --> 01:08:00,298
He is one of us.

512
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,711
He comes from the same place as Bond.

513
01:08:02,737 --> 01:08:04,989
The place you say doesn't exist.

514
01:08:05,528 --> 01:08:07,286
The shadows.

515
01:09:16,229 --> 01:09:18,458
They abandoned it almost overnight.

516
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:23,305
He made them think there was a leak
at the chemical plant.

517
01:09:24,735 --> 01:09:28,667
It is amazing the panic you can
cause with a single computer.

518
01:09:29,135 --> 01:09:31,064
He wanted the island.

519
01:09:31,182 --> 01:09:33,086
So he took it.

520
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:36,248
Does he always get what he wants?

521
01:09:37,403 --> 01:09:39,283
More than you know.

522
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:45,900
I'm sorry.

523
01:10:12,564 --> 01:10:15,488
Hello, James. Welcome.

524
01:10:15,835 --> 01:10:17,335
Do you like the island?

525
01:10:20,899 --> 01:10:22,430
My grandmother had an island.

526
01:10:23,032 --> 01:10:24,154
Nothing to boast off.

527
01:10:24,533 --> 01:10:26,230
You could walk along
within an hour.

528
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:28,903
But still it was,
it was a paradise for us.

529
01:10:30,261 --> 01:10:32,466
One summer, we went for a visit...

530
01:10:32,697 --> 01:10:36,301
and discovered the place
had been infested with rats.

531
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:40,536
They'd come on a fishing boat
and gorged themselves on coconut.

532
01:10:41,623 --> 01:10:45,134
So, how do you get rid of the rats
off an island?

533
01:10:45,184 --> 01:10:46,402
My grandmother showed me.

534
01:10:47,559 --> 01:10:50,118
We buried an whole drum
and changed the lead.

535
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:52,404
Then we wired the coconut
to the lead as bait...

536
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:56,286
and the rats would come
for the coconut, and...

537
01:10:56,574 --> 01:10:58,059
They would fall into the drum.

538
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:03,384
And after a month
you've trapped all the rats.

539
01:11:03,628 --> 01:11:06,240
But what did you do then?

540
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:08,291
Throw the drum into the ocean?

541
01:11:08,997 --> 01:11:11,140
Burn it? No...

542
01:11:11,707 --> 01:11:13,396
You just leave it...

543
01:11:14,662 --> 01:11:16,972
and they begin to get hungry.

544
01:11:17,835 --> 01:11:21,939
And one by one...

545
01:11:21,988 --> 01:11:23,699
they start eating each other...

546
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:27,485
until there are only two left,
the two survivors.

547
01:11:27,862 --> 01:11:30,070
And then what, do you kill them?
No.

548
01:11:30,734 --> 01:11:33,829
You take them
and releasing them into the trees.

549
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:36,787
And now they don't eat
coconut anymore.

550
01:11:37,476 --> 01:11:39,878
Now they only eat rat.

551
01:11:41,104 --> 01:11:43,662
You have changed their nature.

552
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,005
The two survivors.

553
01:11:47,998 --> 01:11:50,238
This is what you made us.

554
01:11:52,268 --> 01:11:54,359
I made my own choices.

555
01:11:55,327 --> 01:11:56,945
You think you did.

556
01:11:58,011 --> 01:11:59,569
That's their genius.

557
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:03,057
Station H.

558
01:12:03,967 --> 01:12:05,648
Am I right, Hong Kong?

559
01:12:06,838 --> 01:12:08,957
'86 to '97.

560
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,887
Back then, I was her favorite.

561
01:12:12,131 --> 01:12:13,811
And you're not nearly the agent
I was.

562
01:12:13,972 --> 01:12:15,529
I can tell you that.

563
01:12:17,293 --> 01:12:20,439
Just look at you.
Barely held together by your pills...

564
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,981
- and your drink.
- Don't forget my pathetic love of country.

565
01:12:26,057 --> 01:12:28,979
You're still clinging to your faith
in that old woman...

566
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:32,551
- ...when all she does is lie to you.
- She never lied lied to me.

567
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,268
- No?
- No.

568
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:39,259
- What do you score your marksmanship evaluation?
- 70.

569
01:12:39,309 --> 01:12:40,752
40.

570
01:12:42,556 --> 01:12:45,819
- Did she tell you the psychologist
cleared you for duty?
- Yes.

571
01:12:45,868 --> 01:12:48,185
No. No.

572
01:12:56,177 --> 01:12:58,118
Medical evaluation, fail.

573
01:12:58,198 --> 01:13:00,146
Physical evaluation, fail.

574
01:13:00,515 --> 01:13:05,204
Psychological evaluation, alcohol
and substance addiction indicated.

575
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:09,734
Pathological rejection
of authority

576
01:13:09,984 --> 01:13:12,832
based on unresolved
childhood trauma.

577
01:13:18,605 --> 01:13:21,240
Subject is not approved
for field duty

578
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:24,480
and immediate suspension
from service advised.

579
01:13:24,569 --> 01:13:26,581
What is this, if not betrayal?

580
01:13:26,957 --> 01:13:29,479
She send you off to me,
knowing that you're not ready

581
01:13:29,492 --> 01:13:30,701
knowing you will likely die.

582
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,583
Mommy was very bad.

583
01:13:57,337 --> 01:13:59,409
See what she's done to you?

584
01:14:00,483 --> 01:14:03,751
Well, she never tied me
to a chair.

585
01:14:03,801 --> 01:14:08,176
Her loss.

586
01:14:08,931 --> 01:14:11,331
Are you sure this is about her?

587
01:14:11,435 --> 01:14:13,067
It's about her...

588
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:16,233
and you and me.

589
01:14:17,172 --> 01:14:19,475
You see, we are last two rats.

590
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:22,150
We can either eat each other.

591
01:14:29,483 --> 01:14:31,028
Or eat everyone else.

592
01:14:33,811 --> 01:14:37,134
How you're trying to remember
your training now?

593
01:14:38,565 --> 01:14:41,225
What's the regulation to cover this?

594
01:14:45,076 --> 01:14:48,367
Well, first time for everything.

595
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:54,149
What makes you think
this is my first time?

596
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:59,134
Oh, Mr. Bond...

597
01:14:59,738 --> 01:15:03,530
All the physical stuff's so dull.
So dull.

598
01:15:06,519 --> 01:15:07,855
Chasing spies.

599
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:10,180
So old-fashioned.

600
01:15:13,282 --> 01:15:15,073
Your knees must be killing you.

601
01:15:19,981 --> 01:15:21,158
England...

602
01:15:22,024 --> 01:15:24,470
the Empire, MI6.

603
01:15:24,881 --> 01:15:26,703
You're living in the ruins as well.

604
01:15:27,134 --> 01:15:28,594
You just don't know it yet.

605
01:15:29,904 --> 01:15:32,417
At least here there are no
old ladies giving orders...

606
01:15:32,626 --> 01:15:35,400
and no little...

607
01:15:36,653 --> 01:15:39,439
gadgets from those fools
in Q print.

608
01:15:42,063 --> 01:15:43,247
If you'd want it,

609
01:15:43,842 --> 01:15:46,216
you could pick
your own secret missions

610
01:15:46,265 --> 01:15:48,189
as I do.

611
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:50,113
Name it.

612
01:15:51,134 --> 01:15:52,648
Name it.

613
01:15:55,391 --> 01:15:59,908
You destabilize a multinational
by manipulating stocks. Easy.

614
01:16:00,842 --> 01:16:04,452
Interrupt transmission
from a spy satellite over Kabul.

615
01:16:04,487 --> 01:16:06,051
Done.

616
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:10,051
Rig an election in Uganda.
All to the highest bidder.

617
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:12,162
Or a gas explosion in London.

618
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:15,664
Guess the point, anglic.

619
01:16:15,715 --> 01:16:19,051
Well, everyone needs a hobby.

620
01:16:23,194 --> 01:16:26,051
So what's yours?

621
01:16:27,395 --> 01:16:31,051
Resurrection.

622
01:16:32,966 --> 01:16:34,873
Let me show you something.

623
01:16:47,405 --> 01:16:50,208
Tells a story, doesn't it?

624
01:16:53,332 --> 01:16:55,152
They left the island so quickly

625
01:16:55,494 --> 01:16:59,177
that couldn't decide what to take
what to leave, what was important.

626
01:16:59,943 --> 01:17:03,368
And this every day reminds me
to focus on the essentials.

627
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:07,577
There is nothing...
nothing superfluous in my life.

628
01:17:07,838 --> 01:17:11,208
When a thing is redundant,
it is... eliminated.

629
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,189
Fifty-year-old McCullan.

630
01:17:24,269 --> 01:17:26,833
A particular favorite of yours,
I understand?

631
01:17:29,153 --> 01:17:31,814
So... what's the toast?

632
01:17:34,427 --> 01:17:36,751
To the women we love?

633
01:17:47,234 --> 01:17:48,166
Darling...

634
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,454
Darling, your love is out here.

635
01:17:57,729 --> 01:17:58,681
No, no, no, no...

636
01:17:59,747 --> 01:18:01,863
Stand up straight, keep still

637
01:18:04,007 --> 01:18:05,390
and whatever you do,
don't lose your head.

638
01:18:05,782 --> 01:18:08,622
Don't lose your head.

639
01:18:10,907 --> 01:18:12,505
Don't lose your head.

640
01:18:13,813 --> 01:18:16,791
Time to redeem your
marksmanship shoot scores.

641
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:19,720
Let's see.

642
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:21,815
You can be the first...

643
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:25,583
to knock the glass from her head.

644
01:18:31,261 --> 01:18:34,036
And just to be sporting,
I'll let you go first.

645
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,792
Let's see who it's up on top.

646
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:08,743
Oh, I can't believe it.

647
01:19:09,386 --> 01:19:11,079
Can't believe it.

648
01:19:11,438 --> 01:19:13,082
Did you really die that day?

649
01:19:13,778 --> 01:19:17,801
Is there any,
any of the old 007 left?

650
01:19:26,342 --> 01:19:27,805
My turn.

651
01:19:31,324 --> 01:19:33,962
I win. What do you say to that?

652
01:19:37,537 --> 01:19:38,908
A waste of good scotch.

653
01:19:49,917 --> 01:19:51,317
What are you going to do now?

654
01:19:51,502 --> 01:19:53,935
Take me back to her?
All on your own?

655
01:19:54,546 --> 01:19:56,440
Who says I'm on my own?

656
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,844
Alright, time to say hello.

657
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,617
You are smaller than I remembered.

658
01:21:13,865 --> 01:21:16,072
Whereas I barely remember you at all.

659
01:21:16,148 --> 01:21:19,655
Strange, for me it feels just...
like yesterday.

660
01:21:21,064 --> 01:21:23,898
- Are you surprised?
- Not particularly.

661
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:26,105
But then you've always were
a slippery one.

662
01:21:26,398 --> 01:21:29,832
Maybe that's why
you liked me so much.

663
01:21:29,881 --> 01:21:33,265
- You flatter yourself.
- No remorse.

664
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,757
Just as I can imagine it.

665
01:21:37,341 --> 01:21:39,586
Regret is unprofessional.

666
01:21:45,804 --> 01:21:46,956
"Regret is unprofessional"...

667
01:21:47,243 --> 01:21:51,212
They kept for five months
in a room with no air.

668
01:21:51,261 --> 01:21:52,101
They tortured me.

669
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:56,028
And I regretted your secrets.
I regretted you.

670
01:21:57,007 --> 01:21:58,680
But they made me suffer...

671
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,318
and suffer...

672
01:22:01,768 --> 01:22:03,376
and suffer...

673
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,185
until I realized...

674
01:22:07,926 --> 01:22:10,551
it was you... who betrayed me.

675
01:22:11,632 --> 01:22:13,345
You betrayed me.

676
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:17,645
So I had only one thing left.

677
01:22:19,523 --> 01:22:23,136
My cyanide capsule
in my back lift molar.

678
01:22:23,185 --> 01:22:26,182
You remember, right?

679
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:31,070
So I broke the tooth...

680
01:22:32,435 --> 01:22:35,105
and bit into the capsule.

681
01:22:39,796 --> 01:22:41,951
It burned all my insides...

682
01:22:42,914 --> 01:22:44,438
but I didn't die.

683
01:22:47,926 --> 01:22:50,141
Life climbed to me like a disease.

684
01:22:55,127 --> 01:22:56,185
And then...

685
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:57,829
I understood...

686
01:22:58,061 --> 01:23:00,167
why I had survived.

687
01:23:02,893 --> 01:23:06,724
I needed to look in your eyes
one last time.

688
01:23:10,038 --> 01:23:12,181
Well, I hope it was worth it.

689
01:23:14,203 --> 01:23:15,390
Mr. Silva...

690
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:17,684
you are going to be transferred
to Belmarsh Prison...

691
01:23:17,761 --> 01:23:19,837
where you will be remanded
in custody...

692
01:23:20,442 --> 01:23:23,733
until the Crown prosecution service
deem you fit to stand trial...

693
01:23:24,381 --> 01:23:26,871
Say my name. Say it.

694
01:23:26,889 --> 01:23:28,412
My real name.

695
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,341
I know you remember it.

696
01:23:32,536 --> 01:23:36,820
Your name is on the memorial wall
of the very building you attacked.

697
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:39,335
I will have it struck off.

698
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:44,570
Soon, your past will be
as nonexistent as your future.

699
01:23:45,063 --> 01:23:46,967
I'll never see you again.

700
01:23:49,884 --> 01:23:51,954
Do you know what it does to you?

701
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,386
Hydrogen cyanide?

702
01:24:08,731 --> 01:24:11,613
Look at what you do,

703
01:24:12,355 --> 01:24:14,115
Mother...

704
01:24:52,194 --> 01:24:54,247
Let me know what you recover
from his computers.

705
01:24:54,387 --> 01:24:56,219
Has he transmitted the list?
If such, to who?

706
01:24:56,485 --> 01:24:59,015
- I want this resolved.
- Yes, ma' am.

707
01:25:05,373 --> 01:25:07,300
His name is Tiago Rodriguez.

708
01:25:08,506 --> 01:25:10,108
He was a brilliant agent.

709
01:25:10,993 --> 01:25:14,516
But he started operating beyond
his brief, hacking the Chinese.

710
01:25:14,847 --> 01:25:17,560
The hand over was coming up
and they were haunting him, so...

711
01:25:17,582 --> 01:25:18,713
I gave him up.

712
01:25:18,899 --> 01:25:20,390
I got six agents in return...

713
01:25:20,979 --> 01:25:22,556
and a peaceful transition.

714
01:25:22,582 --> 01:25:24,838
We should go, ma' am.
Board Enquiry begins in thirty minutes.

715
01:25:25,844 --> 01:25:28,090
I want to know
what's on that computer.

716
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:43,287
Now, looking at Silva's computer

717
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:47,247
it seems to me he's done a number
of slightly unusual things.

718
01:25:47,796 --> 01:25:49,612
It's established
fail safe protocols...

719
01:25:49,797 --> 01:25:53,157
to wipe the memory if there's
any attempt to access certain files.

720
01:25:54,337 --> 01:25:57,301
Only about six people in the world
can program safe guides like that.

721
01:25:57,326 --> 01:25:59,010
Of course there are.
Can you get past them?

722
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,556
I invented them.

723
01:26:04,737 --> 01:26:06,159
Right then.

724
01:26:07,555 --> 01:26:10,939
Let's see what you got for us...
Mr. Silva.

725
01:26:13,069 --> 01:26:14,738
We're in.

726
01:26:20,613 --> 01:26:21,850
Sir...

727
01:26:22,179 --> 01:26:24,090
what you'd make of this?

728
01:26:28,493 --> 01:26:30,113
This is Omega site.

729
01:26:31,006 --> 01:26:33,037
That's the encrypted level it has.

730
01:26:34,631 --> 01:26:37,588
Looks like obfuscated code
to conceal its true purpose.

731
01:26:39,447 --> 01:26:41,690
Security through obscurity.

732
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:45,747
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I might have order.

733
01:26:47,443 --> 01:26:49,266
I'd like to begin proceedings.

734
01:26:51,047 --> 01:26:52,987
We are gathered today
to address some important issues

735
01:26:53,597 --> 01:26:57,047
concerning the future
of our national security.

736
01:27:02,547 --> 01:27:04,547
Going somewhere?

737
01:27:06,713 --> 01:27:09,896
So you believe your stewardship of MI6
during the recent crisis

738
01:27:10,287 --> 01:27:11,645
has been up to scratch?

739
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,016
Well, I believe we've have
apprehended the responsible party

740
01:27:15,067 --> 01:27:16,429
undertaking the necessary steps

741
01:27:16,587 --> 01:27:19,710
to ensure that the sensitive
information is contained.

742
01:27:20,658 --> 01:27:22,563
Such a job well done.

743
01:27:22,881 --> 01:27:24,588
I'm not saying
all gone perfectly, but...

744
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:27,150
You forgive me for not putting up
the bunting.

745
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:30,511
I find rather difficult to overlook
the monumental security breaches

746
01:27:30,551 --> 01:27:34,568
and dead operatives which you were
singled handedly responsible.

747
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:40,087
He's using a polymorphic engine
to mutate the code.

748
01:27:40,136 --> 01:27:42,664
Whenever I try to gain an access,
it changes.

749
01:27:42,877 --> 01:27:46,060
It's like solving the Rubik's cube
that's fighting back.

750
01:27:51,271 --> 01:27:52,715
Stop.

751
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,734
Go in now.

752
01:28:02,525 --> 01:28:04,000
Grandsborough.

753
01:28:04,046 --> 01:28:05,496
Grandsborough Road,
it's an old...

754
01:28:05,889 --> 01:28:08,047
tube station on the metropolitan line.

755
01:28:08,055 --> 01:28:09,963
Been closed for years.

756
01:28:11,747 --> 01:28:13,590
Use that as a key.

757
01:28:24,403 --> 01:28:26,380
Now, look at it. It's a map.

758
01:28:28,802 --> 01:28:30,805
It's London.

759
01:28:30,855 --> 01:28:33,297
Subterranean London.

760
01:28:34,844 --> 01:28:36,302
What's going on?

761
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:37,761
Why the doors open?

762
01:28:48,337 --> 01:28:51,030
Can someone tell me how to hell
he got into our system?

763
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:56,396
Oh, shit.

764
01:28:57,015 --> 01:28:59,595
Shit, shit, shit.

765
01:29:00,972 --> 01:29:03,547
He hacked this.

766
01:29:10,047 --> 01:29:11,653
Oh, no.

767
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:20,671
Q...

768
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:23,010
He is gone.

769
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:34,344
I'm on the stairwell of the low isolation.

770
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:35,782
Are you with me, Q?

771
01:29:35,922 --> 01:29:37,890
I can hear you.
I'm looking for you.

772
01:29:48,527 --> 01:29:50,186
I've got you.
Tracking your location.

773
01:29:50,391 --> 01:29:51,570
Just keep moving forward.

774
01:29:52,416 --> 01:29:54,431
Enter the next service door
on your right.

775
01:30:01,507 --> 01:30:03,413
If you're through that door,
you should be in the tube.

776
01:30:04,341 --> 01:30:05,623
I'm in the tube.

777
01:30:07,217 --> 01:30:10,282
Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years in the planning.

778
01:30:10,524 --> 01:30:13,198
He wanted us to capture him,
he wanted us to access his computers.

779
01:30:13,429 --> 01:30:14,344
It was all planned.

780
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:18,180
Roving up HQ,
only emergency protocols...

781
01:30:18,722 --> 01:30:20,922
now we have retrieved down here.

782
01:30:20,972 --> 01:30:21,853
I got all that.

783
01:30:22,582 --> 01:30:25,015
What it's got planned next
it worries me.

784
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:28,220
Going through that post, it should be
a service door on your left.

785
01:30:29,884 --> 01:30:31,681
Got it.

786
01:30:34,838 --> 01:30:35,783
It won't open.

787
01:30:35,882 --> 01:30:37,328
Of course it will.
Put your back into it.

788
01:30:37,337 --> 01:30:39,716
Why don't you come down here
and put your back into it?

789
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:45,403
No, it's stuck.

790
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:47,350
Not good.

791
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:49,654
There's a train coming.

792
01:31:08,819 --> 01:31:10,297
I'm through.

793
01:31:10,529 --> 01:31:11,557
I told you.

794
01:31:12,114 --> 01:31:14,863
We've alerted security.
The police are on the way.

795
01:31:51,774 --> 01:31:52,550
Where are you now?

796
01:31:53,121 --> 01:31:54,380
Trampled in the tube station.

797
01:31:54,628 --> 01:31:57,047
Together with half of London.

798
01:32:00,819 --> 01:32:01,875
Oh, I see you.

799
01:32:02,849 --> 01:32:04,756
I know where I am, Q.

800
01:32:05,689 --> 01:32:06,609
Where is he?

801
01:32:06,805 --> 01:32:09,231
Give us a second. I'm looking for it.

802
01:32:17,213 --> 01:32:19,421
There's still many people.
I can't see him.

803
01:32:19,471 --> 01:32:20,967
Welcome to rush hour on the tube.

804
01:32:21,809 --> 01:32:24,188
Something we do not know much about.

805
01:32:34,274 --> 01:32:35,644
The train's leaving.

806
01:32:36,025 --> 01:32:37,490
Do I get on the train?

807
01:32:37,622 --> 01:32:39,692
Don't get on the train unless he's
on it. Wait a minute.

808
01:32:42,922 --> 01:32:44,631
Do I get on the train?

809
01:32:50,006 --> 01:32:51,922
- Bond...
- What?

810
01:32:52,256 --> 01:32:53,797
Get on the train.

811
01:33:07,261 --> 01:33:09,078
He's keen to get home.

812
01:33:09,685 --> 01:33:11,248
Open the door, please.

813
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:15,631
Open the door.

814
01:33:18,604 --> 01:33:21,237
I'm from Safety. Carry on.

815
01:33:27,604 --> 01:33:30,643
- Where are you?
- Take a wild guess, Q.

816
01:33:31,255 --> 01:33:33,199
He's in disguise, now.
Disguised as a policeman.

817
01:33:33,576 --> 01:33:35,000
Of course he is.

818
01:33:58,009 --> 01:33:59,484
Where is he going?

819
01:34:06,435 --> 01:34:07,301
He's going for M.

820
01:34:07,422 --> 01:34:09,341
Tell Tanner. Get her out of there.

821
01:34:09,365 --> 01:34:11,708
You overlooked or chosen to ignore

822
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:13,059
hard evidence

823
01:34:13,676 --> 01:34:16,791
and consistently, almost obstinately...

824
01:34:17,073 --> 01:34:18,412
Silva has escaped.

825
01:34:18,921 --> 01:34:19,653
Bond is in pursuit.

826
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,591
We need to get you to a security
station immediately, ma'am.

827
01:34:22,672 --> 01:34:24,922
I doubt I can now show my back.

828
01:34:25,213 --> 01:34:27,279
Are we straining your attention?

829
01:34:27,435 --> 01:34:31,045
No. Please, Minister. Proceed.

830
01:34:38,922 --> 01:34:40,381
Excuse me.

831
01:36:03,005 --> 01:36:04,650
It's as if you insist on pretending

832
01:36:04,701 --> 01:36:07,136
we are still living in the golden age
of espionage

833
01:36:07,186 --> 01:36:10,784
when human intelligence
was the only resource available.

834
01:36:10,802 --> 01:36:12,841
I find this rather old-fashioned belief

835
01:36:13,104 --> 01:36:15,751
demonstrates a reckless disregard...

836
01:36:15,801 --> 01:36:18,127
Excuse me, Minister.
I don't mean to interrupt.

837
01:36:18,216 --> 01:36:19,800
But, just for the sake of variety

838
01:36:20,578 --> 01:36:23,149
might we actually hear
from the witness?

839
01:36:24,206 --> 01:36:25,694
Of course.

840
01:36:28,963 --> 01:36:30,713
Thank you.

841
01:36:58,849 --> 01:37:01,036
I won't miss next time, Mr. Silva.

842
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:01,970
Not bad.

843
01:37:02,078 --> 01:37:04,793
Not bad, James,
for a physical wreck.

844
01:37:05,087 --> 01:37:06,645
Oh, thank you.

845
01:37:07,104 --> 01:37:08,520
You got me.

846
01:37:10,277 --> 01:37:13,405
Now, here's your prize.

847
01:37:13,456 --> 01:37:16,792
The latest thing
from my local toy store.

848
01:37:17,172 --> 01:37:20,095
It is called "radio".

849
01:37:28,118 --> 01:37:29,940
I do hope that wasn't for me.

850
01:37:30,297 --> 01:37:31,338
No.

851
01:37:32,131 --> 01:37:33,256
But that is.

852
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:25,815
Chairman, Ministers...

853
01:38:26,488 --> 01:38:28,282
today I repeatedly heard how

854
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:31,005
irrelevant my department
has become.

855
01:38:31,179 --> 01:38:33,856
Why you need agents
for 00 section...

856
01:38:33,962 --> 01:38:35,859
isn't it all rather quaint.

857
01:38:37,237 --> 01:38:40,373
Well, I suppose I see a different
world than you do.

858
01:38:41,501 --> 01:38:44,967
And the truth is that
what I see frightens me.

859
01:38:46,756 --> 01:38:50,484
I'm frightened because our enemies
are not longer known to us.

860
01:38:51,255 --> 01:38:53,261
They do not exist on the map.

861
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:55,207
They're no nations.

862
01:38:55,635 --> 01:38:57,069
They are individuals.

863
01:38:58,659 --> 01:39:00,542
But look around you,
who do you fear?

864
01:39:01,168 --> 01:39:04,795
When you see a face, a uniform? No.

865
01:39:05,631 --> 01:39:07,743
Our world is not
more transparent now.

866
01:39:07,969 --> 01:39:09,425
It's more opaque.

867
01:39:09,856 --> 01:39:11,627
It's in the shadows.

868
01:39:12,695 --> 01:39:15,021
That's where we must do back.

869
01:39:16,024 --> 01:39:19,154
So, before you declare
this irrelevant, ask yourselves.

870
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:21,963
How safe do you feel?

871
01:39:27,364 --> 01:39:29,006
Just one more thing to say.

872
01:39:29,605 --> 01:39:32,242
My late husband was
a great lover of poetry.

873
01:39:32,658 --> 01:39:34,266
And...

874
01:39:34,317 --> 01:39:36,225
I suppose some fit some kin

875
01:39:36,251 --> 01:39:38,391
despite my best intentions.

876
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:41,132
And here today, I remember this.

877
01:39:41,182 --> 01:39:43,246
I think... from Tennyson.

878
01:39:45,845 --> 01:39:48,609
"We are not now that strength"

879
01:39:49,296 --> 01:39:52,002
"which in old day moved
Earth and Heaven."

880
01:39:53,331 --> 01:39:55,271
"That which we are, we are."

881
01:39:56,301 --> 01:39:59,296
"One equal temper of heroic hearts."

882
01:40:00,233 --> 01:40:04,375
"Made weak by time and fate."

883
01:40:05,006 --> 01:40:08,090
"But strong in will..."

884
01:40:08,139 --> 01:40:11,466
"to strive, to seek, to find"

885
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:15,136
"and not to yield."

886
01:41:36,542 --> 01:41:37,804
Move.

887
01:41:37,828 --> 01:41:40,414
Move. Move.

888
01:42:21,108 --> 01:42:22,847
007, what the hell are we doing?

889
01:42:22,963 --> 01:42:24,261
You're kidnapping me.

890
01:42:24,286 --> 01:42:26,542
That will be one way of looking at it.

891
01:42:28,796 --> 01:42:31,193
Too many people are dying
because of me.

892
01:42:31,552 --> 01:42:33,984
If he wants you,
he's gonna have to come and get you.

893
01:42:34,034 --> 01:42:36,417
We've been one step behind Silva
from the start.

894
01:42:36,467 --> 01:42:38,822
It's time to get out in front
and change the game.

895
01:42:39,182 --> 01:42:40,894
And I'm to be the bait?

896
01:42:43,105 --> 01:42:44,559
All right.

897
01:42:45,134 --> 01:42:47,439
Just us. No one else.

898
01:42:48,394 --> 01:42:50,677
Q, I need help.

899
01:42:50,814 --> 01:42:52,604
I'm tracking the car.
Where are you going?

900
01:42:52,884 --> 01:42:55,117
I got M.
We're about to disappear.

901
01:42:55,506 --> 01:42:56,443
What?

902
01:42:56,643 --> 01:42:57,890
I need you to lay
a trail of breadcrumbs

903
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:00,091
impossible to follow
for anyone except Silva.

904
01:43:00,115 --> 01:43:01,610
Think you can do it?

905
01:43:03,278 --> 01:43:04,886
I'm guessing
this isn't strictly official.

906
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:06,402
Not even remotely.

907
01:43:06,572 --> 01:43:09,725
So much for my promising career
in espionage.

908
01:43:18,453 --> 01:43:21,136
Well, I'm not hiding in there,
if that was your brilliant plan.

909
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:22,689
We're changing vehicles.

910
01:43:23,277 --> 01:43:26,556
The trouble with company cars
is that they have trackers.

911
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:39,457
And I suppose
that's completely inconspicuous.

912
01:43:40,394 --> 01:43:41,833
Get in.

913
01:44:04,087 --> 01:44:05,923
It's not getting comfortable, is it?

914
01:44:07,863 --> 01:44:09,697
Are you going to complain
the whole way?

915
01:44:09,801 --> 01:44:11,600
Oh, go on and eject me.

916
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:12,936
See if I care.

917
01:44:15,489 --> 01:44:16,733
Where are we going?

918
01:44:18,483 --> 01:44:19,398
Back in time.

919
01:44:20,599 --> 01:44:22,595
Somewhere we'll have the advantage.

920
01:44:24,648 --> 01:44:25,773
Really not easy.

921
01:44:26,375 --> 01:44:28,847
With the breadcrumbs too small
and we might miss it.

922
01:44:28,988 --> 01:44:31,354
Too big and Silva will smell the rat.

923
01:44:31,404 --> 01:44:34,265
That's why you think even Silva
will be able to spot that?

924
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,011
He's the only one who could.

925
01:44:38,515 --> 01:44:39,591
Sir...

926
01:44:42,578 --> 01:44:43,805
What are you doing?

927
01:44:43,831 --> 01:44:45,234
We just... monitoring...

928
01:44:45,484 --> 01:44:48,872
creating a false tracking
signal for Silva to follow.

929
01:44:49,168 --> 01:44:50,305
Well, sir...

930
01:44:51,234 --> 01:44:53,119
Excellent thinking. Get him isolated.

931
01:44:53,212 --> 01:44:55,015
Send him on the A9.
It's the direct route.

932
01:44:55,104 --> 01:44:57,217
You can monitor his progress
more accurately.

933
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,713
You can you confirm it
with the traffic cameras.

934
01:44:59,764 --> 01:45:01,835
But... what if the P.M. finds out?

935
01:45:02,939 --> 01:45:04,585
Then, we're all buggered.

936
01:45:05,148 --> 01:45:06,807
Carry on.

937
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:50,271
This is where you grew up.

938
01:45:51,489 --> 01:45:52,699
Mmhh...

939
01:45:55,193 --> 01:45:57,145
How old were you when they died?

940
01:46:00,581 --> 01:46:02,498
You know the answer to that.

941
01:46:04,662 --> 01:46:06,581
You know the whole story.

942
01:46:15,042 --> 01:46:17,572
Orphans always make
the best recruits.

943
01:46:23,668 --> 01:46:25,311
Storm's coming.

944
01:47:25,122 --> 01:47:26,956
Christ...

945
01:47:29,211 --> 01:47:30,949
No wonder you never came back.

946
01:48:24,747 --> 01:48:26,158
James...

947
01:48:26,331 --> 01:48:27,998
James Bond.

948
01:48:28,048 --> 01:48:29,667
Good God.

949
01:48:31,114 --> 01:48:32,761
You're still alive.

950
01:48:34,337 --> 01:48:36,706
Nice to see you, too.

951
01:48:38,573 --> 01:48:40,630
M... this is Kincade.

952
01:48:41,291 --> 01:48:43,581
Kincade is keeping here
since I was a boy.

953
01:48:43,661 --> 01:48:46,411
- Please to meet you, Emma.
- Mr. Kincade.

954
01:48:47,878 --> 01:48:51,234
You are a tad late. They sold the place
when they thought you were dead.

955
01:48:51,298 --> 01:48:53,083
Seems they were wrong.

956
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:55,240
What are you doing here?

957
01:48:55,712 --> 01:48:57,533
Some men are coming to kill us.

958
01:48:58,907 --> 01:49:00,465
I'm gonna kill him first.

959
01:49:02,279 --> 01:49:04,622
Then we'd better get ready.

960
01:49:06,163 --> 01:49:07,663
Do we still have a gun room?

961
01:49:11,408 --> 01:49:15,890
They sold a lot to a collector
from Idaho or some such place.

962
01:49:16,002 --> 01:49:18,524
They were shipped up weeks ago.

963
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:24,439
There's just your father's
old hunting rifle.

964
01:49:25,306 --> 01:49:27,484
We couldn't let that go.

965
01:49:33,364 --> 01:49:34,764
And this is what we've got.

966
01:49:36,304 --> 01:49:39,353
There might be a couple of sticks
of dynamite from the quarry.

967
01:49:40,385 --> 01:49:43,873
But, if all else fails, sometimes...

968
01:49:44,365 --> 01:49:47,627
the old ways are the best.

969
01:49:52,668 --> 01:49:55,193
So, who we are supposed
to be fighting?

970
01:49:55,622 --> 01:49:57,563
No "we", Kincade.

971
01:49:58,168 --> 01:50:00,010
This is not your fight.

972
01:50:00,034 --> 01:50:03,206
Try to stop me,
you jumped-up little shit.

973
01:50:04,872 --> 01:50:06,960
Now, remember what I taught to you.
Don't let it pull to the left.

974
01:50:09,775 --> 01:50:11,497
I'll do my best.

975
01:50:20,283 --> 01:50:22,569
What did you say you did
for the living?

976
01:50:37,889 --> 01:50:39,201
Emma...

977
01:50:40,069 --> 01:50:42,101
I brought you some things.

978
01:50:44,936 --> 01:50:46,856
The nights get cold here.

979
01:50:47,716 --> 01:50:49,391
Thank you, Mr. Kincade.

980
01:50:51,029 --> 01:50:52,372
It's a beautiful old house.

981
01:50:52,456 --> 01:50:53,872
She is.

982
01:50:54,163 --> 01:50:56,059
And like all great ladies...

983
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:58,956
she still has her secret ways.

984
01:50:59,628 --> 01:51:01,087
Let me show you this.

985
01:51:06,171 --> 01:51:07,342
A priest hole.

986
01:51:07,393 --> 01:51:09,761
Yes, from Reformation times.

987
01:51:10,277 --> 01:51:11,917
The tunnel leads under the moor.

988
01:51:11,967 --> 01:51:14,662
If you get in danger,
this is the place to come.

989
01:51:15,595 --> 01:51:17,626
The night I told him
his parents have died...

990
01:51:18,506 --> 01:51:21,081
he hid in here for two days.

991
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:24,511
But he did come out

992
01:51:25,051 --> 01:51:26,979
he was no boy anymore.

993
01:51:28,094 --> 01:51:30,152
Ehm, we must get on.

994
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:32,948
I fucked this up, didn't I?

995
01:53:34,283 --> 01:53:35,614
No.

996
01:53:37,403 --> 01:53:39,212
You did your job.

997
01:53:44,363 --> 01:53:46,100
I read your obituary of me.

998
01:53:47,756 --> 01:53:50,045
- And?
- Appalling.

999
01:53:50,890 --> 01:53:52,595
Yes, I knew you'd hated it.

1000
01:53:54,904 --> 01:53:56,997
It could be an example
of the British fortitude.

1001
01:53:57,947 --> 01:53:59,317
That was all right.

1002
01:54:04,806 --> 01:54:06,118
Are you ready?

1003
01:54:06,127 --> 01:54:08,747
I was ready before
you're were born, son.

1004
01:55:28,805 --> 01:55:30,659
Welcome to Scotland.

1005
01:56:47,139 --> 01:56:48,972
Did he drop something?

1006
01:57:15,139 --> 01:57:16,280
Are you hurt?

1007
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:17,863
Only in my pride.

1008
01:57:18,047 --> 01:57:19,867
I never was a good shot.

1009
01:57:24,775 --> 01:57:25,801
He's not here...

1010
01:57:26,778 --> 01:57:27,998
and he's not here.

1011
01:58:02,487 --> 01:58:04,652
Always good to make an entrance.

1012
01:58:05,694 --> 01:58:07,564
Each of you, go to the kitchen.
Now!

1013
01:58:32,104 --> 01:58:33,761
Go behind the yard.

1014
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:18,417
Go to the chapel. Use the tunnel.

1015
02:00:39,695 --> 02:00:42,849
Everyone listen to me.
Don't you dare touch M.

1016
02:00:42,899 --> 02:00:44,438
She's mine.

1017
02:01:01,101 --> 02:01:03,488
Can't you just come out and say hello?

1018
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:12,953
Come on. This way.

1019
02:03:09,998 --> 02:03:12,284
I always hated this place.

1020
02:03:22,297 --> 02:03:24,457
Are you getting warm?

1021
02:04:52,850 --> 02:04:54,864
Just make sure Bond is dead.

1022
02:04:58,314 --> 02:05:00,720
Now it's me and her.

1023
02:06:58,364 --> 02:07:02,170
You see what comes of all
this running around, Mr. Bond?

1024
02:07:03,070 --> 02:07:05,743
All this jumping and fighting.

1025
02:07:05,769 --> 02:07:07,256
It's exhausting.

1026
02:07:10,664 --> 02:07:11,868
Relax.

1027
02:07:13,818 --> 02:07:15,518
You need to relax.

1028
02:07:34,958 --> 02:07:36,917
Well, Mother's calling.

1029
02:07:38,729 --> 02:07:41,145
I'll give her a goodbye kiss for you.

1030
02:09:59,775 --> 02:10:01,426
Of course.

1031
02:10:01,750 --> 02:10:03,465
It had to be here.

1032
02:10:06,025 --> 02:10:08,175
It had to be this way.

1033
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:10,847
Thank you.

1034
02:10:11,006 --> 02:10:12,194
- I can't find it, though.
- Don't.

1035
02:10:16,529 --> 02:10:17,577
Please.

1036
02:10:18,319 --> 02:10:19,720
Don't.

1037
02:10:34,439 --> 02:10:36,029
You're hurt. You're hurt.

1038
02:10:40,972 --> 02:10:43,247
What have they done to you?

1039
02:10:43,730 --> 02:10:45,847
What have they done to you?

1040
02:11:17,979 --> 02:11:19,360
Free both of us.

1041
02:11:20,041 --> 02:11:21,332
Free both of us.

1042
02:11:23,154 --> 02:11:24,921
With the same bullet.

1043
02:11:26,189 --> 02:11:27,225
Do it.

1044
02:11:28,203 --> 02:11:29,484
Do it!

1045
02:11:30,970 --> 02:11:32,556
Only you can do it.

1046
02:11:33,384 --> 02:11:34,474
Do it!

1047
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:18,930
Last rat standing.

1048
02:12:29,514 --> 02:12:31,162
007.

1049
02:12:31,222 --> 02:12:32,345
What took you so long?

1050
02:12:33,992 --> 02:12:36,203
I got into this deep water.

1051
02:12:51,756 --> 02:12:53,219
I suppose it's...

1052
02:12:54,175 --> 02:12:56,856
too late to make a run for it.

1053
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:04,399
Well, I'm game if you are.

1054
02:13:14,567 --> 02:13:17,226
I did get one thing right.

1055
02:14:43,997 --> 02:14:46,342
Wow. I didn't even know
you could come up here.

1056
02:14:47,529 --> 02:14:49,537
I hate to waste a view.

1057
02:14:49,587 --> 02:14:51,597
I can see why.

1058
02:14:53,389 --> 02:14:56,123
I thought you were going back out
on active service.

1059
02:14:57,534 --> 02:14:59,167
I declined.

1060
02:15:00,930 --> 02:15:02,377
You said it yourself.

1061
02:15:02,979 --> 02:15:04,966
Field work is not for everyone.

1062
02:15:05,863 --> 02:15:08,597
If it helps, I feel a lot safer.

1063
02:15:13,972 --> 02:15:15,690
Her will was read today.

1064
02:15:16,738 --> 02:15:18,472
She left you this.

1065
02:15:30,463 --> 02:15:33,117
Maybe it's her way to tell you
to take a desk job.

1066
02:15:34,231 --> 02:15:35,823
Just the opposite.

1067
02:15:39,088 --> 02:15:40,805
Thank you.

1068
02:15:59,306 --> 02:16:01,752
You know, we've never formally
been introduced.

1069
02:16:05,559 --> 02:16:07,261
Oh, my name is Eve.

1070
02:16:07,896 --> 02:16:09,457
Eve Moneypenny.

1071
02:16:10,023 --> 02:16:12,673
I look forward to our time
together, Miss Moneypenny.

1072
02:16:13,268 --> 02:16:14,509
Me too.

1073
02:16:15,092 --> 02:16:17,716
I'm sure we will have
one or two close shaves.

1074
02:16:19,606 --> 02:16:20,764
Good morning, 007.

1075
02:16:21,042 --> 02:16:23,699
- Good morning, Tanner.
- He'll see you now.

1076
02:16:38,864 --> 02:16:40,388
How's the arm, sir?

1077
02:16:41,781 --> 02:16:43,057
It's fine.

1078
02:16:43,237 --> 02:16:44,513
It'll get better.

1079
02:16:44,648 --> 02:16:46,251
All pretty shocking for someone...

1080
02:16:46,275 --> 02:16:48,688
unused to field work.

1081
02:16:50,513 --> 02:16:52,347
So, 007...

1082
02:16:52,769 --> 02:16:54,888
lots to be done.

1083
02:16:58,213 --> 02:17:00,391
Are you ready to get back to work?

1084
02:17:02,041 --> 02:17:03,638
With pleasure, M.

1085
02:17:06,168 --> 02:17:07,763
With pleasure.

1086
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:11,055
