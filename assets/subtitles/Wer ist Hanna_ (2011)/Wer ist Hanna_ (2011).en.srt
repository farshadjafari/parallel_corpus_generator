1
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,228
I just missed your heart.

2
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:30,626
You are dead right now.

3
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:32,922
I've killed you.

4
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:46,130
Use your hands.

5
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:04,444
Drag the deer back yourself

6
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,243
What's wrong?

7
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,095
Are you hurt?

8
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:13,333
You were half asleep.

9
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:15,674
You must always be ready.

10
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:17,706
Even when you're sleeping.

11
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:19,666
Think on your feet.

12
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,713
- Adapt...
- Or die.

13
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,495
I'll do better next time.

14
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:25,251
German.

15
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:27,960
I'll do better next time.

16
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,353
Italian

17
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:32,489
I'll do better next time.

18
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:35,441
Spanish

19
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:39,234
Español

20
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,638
Did you really want
me to snap your neck?

21
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:46,440
How much did you pull off the deer?

22
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:49,916
In 120 parts.

23
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:51,806
200 pounds in total.

24
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,102
I think so.

25
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:55,637
That explains it.

26
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,446
What?

27
00:04:58,447 --> 00:04:59,886
How you beat me.

28
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:02,517
You've getting stronger.

29
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:13,159
I'm glad you didnt snap my neck.

30
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:18,260
The great blue whale is the
largest animal to have ever existed.

31
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:20,956
Its heart weighs 1300 pounds.

32
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:23,064
And the male has 7 gallons of...

33
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,170
testicles.

34
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,879
The blue whale's music can be
heard for over five hundred miles..

35
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:34,276
A blue whale's tongue weighs
overs two and a half tons. 41.

36
00:05:34,277 --> 00:05:35,790
What does music feel like?

37
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:43,398
Music
- a combination of sounds

38
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:47,653
with a view to beauty of form
and expression of emotion.

39
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:50,775
I want to hear it for myself.

40
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,290
We've all we need right here.

41
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:55,143
It's not enough.

42
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:00,747
I'm ready.

43
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:03,606
Papa, I'm ready.

44
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:25,457
Grimm's Fairy Tales

45
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:18,470
One, two, three, four, five, six

46
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:21,813
I live in Leipzig German city

47
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:23,937
Population: 0.7 million peoples

48
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,733
Tell me again 54.

49
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:27,492
Wilhelm Grimm's House Stefan Straza,

50
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:29,141
21610559, Berlin, Germany.

51
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:31,589
We live at number 7, Vicenza Platz.

52
00:07:32,964 --> 00:07:34,541
I go to school at The
Klaus College Gymnasium.

53
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:37,539
And my best friends are Rudy
Gunter and Clara Scheitz.

54
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:40,045
Wilhelm Grimm's House Stefan Straza,

55
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:43,277
21610559, Berlin, Germany.
I like literature and sport.

56
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:45,329
In particular, tennis and athletics.

57
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,358
We live at number 7, Vicenza Platz. I go
to school at The Klaus College Gymnasium.

58
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:52,408
And my best friends are Rudy
Gunter and Clara Scheitz.

59
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,227
I also have a dog called Trudy.

60
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:28,983
I'm ready.

61
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:30,709
I'm ready now.

62
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,189
Did you see it? Did you hear it?

63
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,312
It's like thunder! It was so beautiful!

64
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:46,975
What is it?

65
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:49,278
It tells Marissa Wiegler where we are

66
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,140
If you think you're ready,
and you want to leave here,

67
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:56,414
all you have to do is flip that switch.

68
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:02,689
But once it's done
there's no going back.

69
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:06,283
She won't stop until you're dead,

70
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:09,406
or she is. You understand?

71
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:13,453
I won't be there to hold your hand.

72
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:17,212
So be sure

73
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,955
Be sure it's what you really want.

74
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:28,429
It's here. There's no rush. 80mm

75
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,528
Laika, a mongrel dog
from the street of Moscow,

76
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:44,505
was the first animal to orbit the Earth.

77
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:49,720
She was launched into outer space
on the third of November, 1957.

78
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,554
Scientists believe humans

79
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:55,709
would be unable to survive
the conditions of outer space.

80
00:10:56,063 --> 00:10:58,620
So flights by animals were used

81
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:01,273
as experiments precursory
to human missions.

82
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:05,238
A rocket was not designed
to be retrievable,

83
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:09,376
and laika has always
been, intended to die

84
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,816
But she didn't, did she?

85
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:14,338
They couldn't bring the
rocket back, remember?

86
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:16,622
I remember.

87
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:19,790
But sometimes I wish you
would read it differently.

88
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:28,255
When a star collapses,

89
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:30,778
the supernova explosion
is ten billion times

90
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,488
brighter than the other stars

91
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:05,203
Will you hunt with me?

92
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:08,001
If you want.

93
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:10,423
Well, it's up to you.

94
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:14,579
Me? Yes

95
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:19,649
I'll stay.

96
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:26,994
Yes, good.

97
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,680
Marissa Wiegler...

98
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,495
...come and find me.

99
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:30,398
You were lucky to have caught that deer.

100
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,019
There was nothing out there today.

101
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:43,193
The smell's good.

102
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,415
When will it be ready?

103
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:48,348
Soon.

104
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:40,876
We've picked up an unencrypted
signal. One of ours.

105
00:14:40,877 --> 00:14:43,014
When?
- 0630, 2 Eastern Standard.

106
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,201
Triangulated about 60 miles
below the Arctic Circle.

107
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:47,115
Near kazuma. We think it is Erik Heller.

108
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:48,830
- Erik Heller?
- You're his handler, right?

109
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,485
Sure, the name sounds familiar.

110
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,539
Fuck Erik.

111
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:02,942
Why now?

112
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,415
How does it look?

113
00:15:13,992 --> 00:15:15,336
Good...

114
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:20,827
Almost good.

115
00:15:20,862 --> 00:15:23,113
Erik Heller, recruited in 1991.

116
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:25,157
Formal FSK operative He
became integral to our

117
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,154
Counter Intelligence Ops in Eastern

118
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,849
Europe and Central Asia.

119
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,930
His file ends in '94.

120
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,004
There was no sign of
life until April 18, 1996,

121
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:36,898
when his fingerprints were
found on a 22 calibre ruger,

122
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,211
found beside body of one, Johanna Zadek.

123
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:42,008
Johanna Zadek, born in 1970, German

124
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,542
She was spotted and
developed by Heller in 1994.

125
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,655
- Never recruited.
- Why was she being developed?

126
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:48,735
That's not in the file.
Let's keep on the past.

127
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,842
Heller is a rogue asset. I
propose we go and pull him out.

128
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:53,360
We got bigger problems, Marissa.

129
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:56,261
Let Interpol pick him up. He's
no longer our responsibility.

130
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:59,300
Interpol nabs him, that
exposes him to BND, FSB, France.

131
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:01,602
Do you really want
every intelligence agency

132
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:03,825
in Europe scratching at this threat?

133
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:05,104
- Lewis?
- I'm Sorry,

134
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:06,847
but we need to keep this
contained, gentlemen.

135
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:08,675
Keep it small. I've
worked with this man.

136
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,647
He knows things I don't
think you wanna know.

137
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:11,992
I appreciate your candor.

138
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:14,769
- What do you need Lewis? -
One man, one-day operation.

139
00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:23,963
- Tell me again.
- Marissa Wiegler.

140
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:25,482
- Then?
- Postcard.

141
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:26,696
- Then?
- What?

142
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:28,869
- The address where we meet.
- Wilhelm Grimm House,

143
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,903
Stefan Straza, 21610559,
Berlin, Germany.

144
00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:32,630
- Then what else?
- Adapt or die.

145
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:35,179
- Think on your feet...
- ... Even when I'm sleeping.

146
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,856
Papa.

147
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:42,275
Remember what I taught
you and you will be fine.

148
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:44,474
I'll see you there.

149
00:18:24,877 --> 00:18:26,460
Macalahan, do you read me?

150
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:31,608
Macalahan.

151
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:33,336
Macalahan, do you read me?

152
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,972
Go, go, go.

153
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:56,427
Erik Heller escaped.

154
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:57,989
How did that happen?

155
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,254
Unclear. We think he got
away in the snow storm or

156
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,996
And 'something bigger
than that I can manage.

157
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:05,116
- One man, one day of operations. Just find him, Lewis.
- Look there were many variables.

158
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:06,654
Find him and bring him to me.

159
00:19:06,655 --> 00:19:09,083
There was a kid. Things
got out of our control!

160
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:12,619
Wiegler

161
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:14,841
Wiegler, are you there?

162
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:16,297
Where is she now?

163
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:22,661
Hello, Hanna.

164
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:24,659
Hello

165
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:27,939
My name is Dr. Burton.
Would you like to talk to me?

166
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:32,586
I was told by my father
to gain the upper hand.

167
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:34,140
That's very interesting.

168
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:36,843
What else did your father tell you?

169
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:39,752
Where am I?

170
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,617
You are in holding.

171
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,610
I've never been in a room like this.

172
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:46,972
Must all be very strange for you.

173
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:49,259
How long have you been
in the forest? 180mm.

174
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:55,968
Hanna?

175
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:03,274
- Are those cameras?
- Uhuh.

176
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:06,764
They're taking our pictures right now,

177
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:08,560
to keep a record.

178
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:10,066
How does that make you feel?

179
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:12,427
Camera obscura...

180
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:15,122
It's Latin, for dark chamber.

181
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:17,918
It was first described
by the Arabic scientist

182
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,838
Ibn al-Haytham in the year 1021.

183
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,667
Plug the cctv through to Langley.

184
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:27,483
Hey, you should have a visual
on the psych evaluation there

185
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,570
Can I get you something?
What do you like?

186
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:31,372
Music, magazines

187
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:33,508
Just ask, anything.

188
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,600
I want to speak to Marissa Wiegler.

189
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:41,956
- Tell her I'll be there tonight.
- I can handle this.

190
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,865
Just do what you're told.

191
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,697
John, take a look at
this kid's blood sample

192
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:53,872
- Is that right?
- Is it?

193
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:56,561
- Can be right.
- Got a sample of her hair.

194
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,711
Must be contaminated. Run it again.

195
00:21:25,723 --> 00:21:27,834
My name is Marissa Wiegler.

196
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,239
You wanted to speak with me?

197
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:40,171
You can wait outside.

198
00:21:46,537 --> 00:21:48,072
Where am I?

199
00:21:48,118 --> 00:21:50,216
You are in a safe place, sweetie.

200
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:54,489
Where did you meet my father?

201
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:57,149
Erik.

202
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,589
You mean Erik?

203
00:22:00,794 --> 00:22:02,195
Yes

204
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:05,884
I met him by a news kiosk at
Alexander Platz. East Berlin.

205
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:09,188
I met him at a news kiosk,

206
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:12,245
- Alexanderplatz...
- Say it was raining.

207
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:13,685
...in the rain.

208
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:20,156
He'd just arrived from Prague.

209
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:28,940
You know where your father is?

210
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:31,909
Did he tell you where he was going?

211
00:22:33,627 --> 00:22:35,258
We're are worried about him.

212
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,739
It's okay.

213
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,453
Agent, keep your distance.

214
00:22:43,885 --> 00:22:45,326
It's okay.

215
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:48,003
It's okay.

216
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:51,185
Do you want me to give her something?

217
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,920
I think that might be necessary.

218
00:22:55,095 --> 00:22:56,391
Abort.

219
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:00,207
Open up.

220
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,310
I repeat agent, abort!

221
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,392
Oh, my...

222
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:26,890
Wiegler!

223
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,636
Wiegler!

224
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:46,179
I want everyone here now

225
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:53,929
Do not let it escape from the gallery.

226
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,540
- Do you think she got out?
- She can't get out.

227
00:26:22,994 --> 00:26:27,372
Detail every unit available

228
00:29:29,526 --> 00:29:30,966
Mama

229
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:21,763
She will never be yours.

230
00:31:39,976 --> 00:31:42,194
She will never be yours.

231
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,635
Hey, hello.

232
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:23,440
Don't you speak English?

233
00:32:24,852 --> 00:32:26,291
It's not your fault if you can't.

234
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,307
Emma Ackery couldn't speak
English until she was eight,

235
00:32:29,308 --> 00:32:32,284
because she was like, a refugee
or something from Sri Lanka.

236
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:34,590
But now she's a pop
star, in America too.

237
00:32:34,591 --> 00:32:37,027
So don't worry if you
can't speak English yet.

238
00:32:37,028 --> 00:32:38,414
Who's she?

239
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,869
I found her, She can't speak
English. She's from Sri Lanka.

240
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,166
I'm from Germany.

241
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,166
Oh

242
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,199
I live in Leipzig, Population:
0.7 million peoples.

243
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,804
We live at No. 7 Vicenza Platz.

244
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:53,625
I like literature and sport, in
particular tennis and athletics.

245
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:55,935
I go to school at The
Klaus College Gymnasium.

246
00:32:55,936 --> 00:32:58,647
And my best friends are Rudy
Gunter and Clara Scheitz.

247
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:00,301
They sound fun.

248
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:02,287
I also have a dog called Trudy.

249
00:33:02,322 --> 00:33:05,356
We had a dog called Vincent,
But he went mad and died.

250
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:15,965
Sophie, come on.

251
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,661
See ya.

252
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,101
Sophie, come on.

253
00:33:34,477 --> 00:33:36,992
I'm Sophie and that
is my brother, Miles.

254
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,614
I am... Hanna.

255
00:33:40,003 --> 00:33:41,827
Do you need a lift somewhere?

256
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:46,022
No. I prefer to walk.

257
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,830
Suit yourself

258
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:54,382
Sophie, come on, We
are all waiting for you

259
00:33:56,865 --> 00:33:59,196
Tacticle says she's in the desert,
south east of vessel we're in.

260
00:33:59,197 --> 00:34:00,803
Focus all operations on Heller.

261
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:03,138
Are you saying the girl's
not of interest to us?

262
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:05,200
Yes, of course she's of interest, Lewis.

263
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:07,702
But not an immediate threat to the
security of the United States of America.

264
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:10,929
Erik Heller is the immediate
threat. Focus on Heller.

265
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,010
Where is your family?

266
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:28,123
- Are you Arabic?
- I am Moroccan.

267
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,675
Morocco Capital city: Rabat.

268
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:34,173
Marrakech, Salé.

269
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:36,190
Religion: Islam. Language: Arabic.

270
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,332
I like Arabic very much.

271
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:43,757
It's like Japanese, it's big.

272
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,235
You speak Arabic?

273
00:36:46,447 --> 00:36:47,886
Yes, of course.

274
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,047
Where is your family?

275
00:36:52,194 --> 00:36:54,435
I need a room for the night.

276
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:57,816
Can you help? I have no money.

277
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:15,711
It's the best we've got.

278
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:17,927
Thank you.

279
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:27,999
Do you have one of these in every room?

280
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:30,401
All the rooms are the same.

281
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,265
It's electricity.

282
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:34,897
Of course, all mod cons.

283
00:37:38,263 --> 00:37:39,985
I know a little about electricity.

284
00:37:39,986 --> 00:37:42,105
They say Edison invented it

285
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,823
- Or was it Franklin?
- Some American I'm sure.

286
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:53,089
This is an electrical kettle.

287
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,584
It's for the English.

288
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:57,791
They like to make their own tea.

289
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,539
What is it?

290
00:38:15,846 --> 00:38:17,478
It's the best we can do.

291
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:27,053
Where do you come from?

292
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:29,918
The forest.

293
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:44,252
It's the German girl.

294
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:45,857
It's Kraut in a big Djellaba.

295
00:39:45,858 --> 00:39:47,848
Like quail or lesbo.

296
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:49,630
I think I'd quite like to be lesbian.

297
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:52,474
But not one of those fat ones,
one who's like, a supermodel.

298
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:55,557
But who don't hold hands, and I
think I'd probably marry a man.

299
00:39:55,918 --> 00:39:57,261
What?

300
00:40:40,465 --> 00:40:41,809
No kiss?

301
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,825
She's a bit old for you, isn't she?

302
00:40:44,597 --> 00:40:46,958
She has male and female genetalias.

303
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:49,264
And you love her just the way she is.

304
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:51,376
I like to give people what they want.

305
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,141
Vera

306
00:40:52,142 --> 00:40:55,023
Make my friend something sweet

307
00:40:55,024 --> 00:40:56,931
I'll save it for when I need it.

308
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:00,375
What do you want, Marissa?

309
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,564
Erik Heller's still alive.

310
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:04,004
Of course.

311
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:05,807
And the girl.

312
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:07,010
Ah.

313
00:41:07,996 --> 00:41:09,919
Why are you here precisely?

314
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:11,880
I need you.

315
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:15,434
You need me? Little old
me! I'm very flattered.

316
00:41:15,435 --> 00:41:17,942
I need your talents, darling.

317
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:19,670
I need you to do things

318
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:21,339
my agency will not let me do.

319
00:41:21,998 --> 00:41:23,295
Stop!

320
00:41:24,012 --> 00:41:25,307
Again.

321
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:27,534
Start again.

322
00:41:31,752 --> 00:41:34,152
The devil is in the details, isn't it?

323
00:41:37,443 --> 00:41:40,270
- It's the girl or Erik?
- She is in Morocco.

324
00:41:40,305 --> 00:41:43,192
It's all in the envelope.
Let me worry about Erik.

325
00:41:44,183 --> 00:41:45,718
Shall I kill her?

326
00:41:46,873 --> 00:41:48,314
Just find her.

327
00:41:51,604 --> 00:41:53,044
Marissa.

328
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:56,909
Did she turn out as you hoped?

329
00:41:58,614 --> 00:42:00,053
Better.

330
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:04,298
Once more.

331
00:42:05,247 --> 00:42:06,543
Again.

332
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:11,392
...and gave me lots of advices.

333
00:42:11,393 --> 00:42:13,735
About how to spend these
money do these taxes.

334
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:16,079
You see even though she is beautiful,
she is actually brilliant with money.

335
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,328
Get off.

336
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,826
Like for one of the
anniversary, he said his 15 grand

337
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:21,838
For a Hermes kelly bag or a boob job.

338
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,879
Now she said she knew that the boob implant
will have to be replaced every 10 years.

339
00:42:25,914 --> 00:42:28,695
But that the Hermes kelly bag
never depreciates in value.

340
00:42:28,696 --> 00:42:30,394
- That's enough for the boob job
- I mean that's not just common sense

341
00:42:30,395 --> 00:42:31,932
And that's why I really love her.

342
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,320
Mum is against plastic surgery.

343
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,498
- I am. - Mum doesn't
even wear make-up.

344
00:42:36,532 --> 00:42:38,356
I don't. I think it's dishonest.

345
00:42:38,357 --> 00:42:40,374
This is my face, Take it or leave it.

346
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,445
If you study History
of Art, Anthropology...

347
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:44,832
Rachel got a first at Cambridge.

348
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:46,530
...you learn that red
lipstick mimic arousal

349
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:48,528
and suggests the geography
of the labia minora.

350
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:50,670
- Puke!
- Where as I have a lot of natural red pigments

351
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:52,120
in my lips and so I
really don't need it.

352
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:53,335
- Vomitory
- Sophie!

353
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:55,350
- It's embarrassing.
- Just grow up! All right?

354
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:56,736
- Grow up?
- Yeah

355
00:42:56,737 --> 00:42:58,713
Oh, because yesterday mum was saying
how I shouldn't act beyond my years.

356
00:42:58,714 --> 00:43:00,442
No, it does leave her with
mixed messages, darling.

357
00:43:00,443 --> 00:43:03,093
Because we're trying to communicate
to her how to enjoy childhood.

358
00:43:03,094 --> 00:43:05,478
I just want her to stop
saying vomitory, all right?

359
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,183
Oi, It's not funny.

360
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:13,741
So, Hanna. Hanna?

361
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,370
I'm quite impressed about you
traveling around on your own.

362
00:43:17,315 --> 00:43:19,277
My father encourages
me to be independent.

363
00:43:19,278 --> 00:43:20,588
You see, that's wonderful.

364
00:43:20,623 --> 00:43:22,698
- I was back packing at your age.
- And where is he, your father?

365
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:26,157
I spent a heavenly summer, just
island hopping around Greece,

366
00:43:26,158 --> 00:43:27,789
Island hopping around Greece!

367
00:43:28,668 --> 00:43:31,131
What? No. It's valuable.

368
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:34,238
Our experience makes us who
we are. Isn't that right, kids?

369
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,701
So Hanna, is your mum
and dad still together?

370
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,142
My mother is dead.

371
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,679
Nice one, dad!

372
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:45,755
I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my
mum when I was very young, so...

373
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,252
It's all right. It
happened a long time ago.

374
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:50,752
Hanna,

375
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,037
what did your mum die of?

376
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,649
Three bullets.

377
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:57,492
Omg, That's appalling!

378
00:44:06,987 --> 00:44:08,801
Combination of sounds

379
00:44:09,432 --> 00:44:11,352
with a view to beauty of form

380
00:44:12,777 --> 00:44:14,921
and expression of emotion..

381
00:44:20,882 --> 00:44:22,418
MEDICAL REPORT

382
00:44:24,065 --> 00:44:25,504
"Abnormal. "

383
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:36,716
What happen if it rains?

384
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:38,061
Well, you going to get wet. Aren't you?

385
00:44:38,062 --> 00:44:39,986
Because someone broke the sunroof.

386
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:41,995
- Your mother and I are...
- Your mother and I...

387
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:45,715
Your mother and I are
responsible adults...

388
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,230
My fungus nail infections' back.

389
00:44:57,176 --> 00:44:58,520
Who are you?

390
00:44:58,521 --> 00:44:59,961
What do you want from the girl?

391
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,904
I am her uncle. 400mm

392
00:45:02,531 --> 00:45:04,355
We are very concerned about her.

393
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,979
I don't know what you're looking for.

394
00:45:07,429 --> 00:45:10,791
She came, she was nice, she left.

395
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,232
Bingo!

396
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,221
Voila!

397
00:45:19,691 --> 00:45:22,284
The van has checked out?

398
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,098
Today

399
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:25,827
North or south?

400
00:45:26,108 --> 00:45:29,133
The ferry. They caugh
the ferry to Spain.

401
00:45:29,134 --> 00:45:31,264
Can you lend me your pen?

402
00:47:44,768 --> 00:47:47,169
- I've contacted Interpol.
- On who's authority?

403
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,284
Walt. We can't keep this
to ourselves anymore.

404
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:52,069
- Were you not listening?
- He killed two policemen.

405
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:55,143
He's reframed the situation.
It is out of our control.

406
00:47:55,317 --> 00:47:57,936
Then we must regain control, Mr. Lewis.

407
00:47:57,966 --> 00:48:02,191
I am the first and the last person
Erik Heller will see. Are we clear?

408
00:48:05,072 --> 00:48:06,658
Are we clear?

409
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:08,529
- Mr. Lewis?
- Yes, Madam.

410
00:48:21,643 --> 00:48:24,427
THE WITCH IS DEAD.

411
00:50:03,678 --> 00:50:06,051
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

412
00:50:07,494 --> 00:50:09,978
The sun roof, was it you?

413
00:50:10,313 --> 00:50:11,658
Would it be very bad if it was?

414
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:14,251
You mean you were in
the van, the whole time?

415
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:17,063
My dad would have a heart
attack if he found out.

416
00:50:17,064 --> 00:50:20,123
- Will you have to tell him?
- Hanna, you are so mental!

417
00:50:20,124 --> 00:50:22,035
Of course I'm not going to tell him.

418
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:25,288
I think it's brilliant. Have
you got anywhere to stay?

419
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,420
- No.
- Yes, you do.

420
00:50:27,421 --> 00:50:29,466
- You're staying with me.
- I am?

421
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:32,673
Yeah, obviously. I'm sneaking
you in, on one condition.

422
00:50:33,047 --> 00:50:34,269
What?

423
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:38,541
These boys. Spanish. Gorgeous.

424
00:50:39,546 --> 00:50:42,382
No, don't look. Don't go all
pruny about it, like footballers.

425
00:50:42,383 --> 00:50:45,315
Haven't got their eyebrows
waxed, or anything!

426
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,763
- Good.
- Anyway, we're going out tonight and you have to come.

427
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:52,091
- All right..
- God, you're not hard to convince! Perv.

428
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:53,388
Who?

429
00:50:55,045 --> 00:50:56,870
Have you got anything to wear?

430
00:50:57,725 --> 00:51:00,509
You can't wear those, you
look like some mad German.

431
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:11,288
Are you scared?

432
00:51:11,425 --> 00:51:12,865
Of what?

433
00:53:56,621 --> 00:53:58,253
Are we going to kiss now?

434
00:54:01,765 --> 00:54:03,108
Would you like to?

435
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,722
Kissing requires a total
of 34 facial muscles

436
00:54:10,723 --> 00:54:13,848
and 112 postural muscles.

437
00:54:15,454 --> 00:54:17,588
The most important muscle involved

438
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:19,048
is the orbicularis oris muscle,

439
00:54:19,638 --> 00:54:22,576
because it is used to pucker the lips

440
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,948
Hanna, you mentalist!

441
00:54:40,949 --> 00:54:44,438
Please tell your friend
I wanted just a kiss.

442
00:54:44,441 --> 00:54:45,881
Hanna!

443
00:54:46,174 --> 00:54:48,864
- Should I let him go?
- As opposed to what?

444
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:50,688
Yes, you should let him go!

445
00:54:54,832 --> 00:54:56,368
I'm going to go now.

446
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,919
Okay.

447
00:54:59,748 --> 00:55:01,188
It was nice.

448
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,417
Sophie, is that you?

449
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,448
It is the sandman.

450
00:55:40,925 --> 00:55:42,652
Go to sleep.

451
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:02,318
Oh, my God You acted like
a bandit. It's embarrassing.

452
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,648
- Like what?
- Oh I can't believe you.

453
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,026
Hello, Mama.

454
00:56:21,626 --> 00:56:23,572
I know you're disappointed in me.

455
00:56:23,573 --> 00:56:26,820
I know it. I am very sorry, Mama.

456
00:56:27,565 --> 00:56:32,125
But.. But maybe I've found
a way to make it better.

457
00:56:32,576 --> 00:56:34,880
I'm in a programme now.

458
00:56:35,112 --> 00:56:37,512
A programme to make babies stronger.

459
00:56:37,788 --> 00:56:40,476
It's an American
programme, very scien...

460
00:56:41,808 --> 00:56:44,016
How did you get into
my house, Mrs. Wiegler?

461
00:56:45,124 --> 00:56:46,756
I'm looking for Erik.

462
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:53,436
He said you were dead.

463
00:56:54,171 --> 00:56:56,187
So you've seen him?

464
00:56:57,823 --> 00:57:01,283
He sent word.

465
00:57:03,004 --> 00:57:04,443
Where is Hanna?

466
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:13,584
Did you ever have children of your own?

467
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:18,662
I made certain choices.

468
00:57:20,912 --> 00:57:24,176
Then you will never understand
what it is like to lose your child.

469
00:57:26,549 --> 00:57:28,788
To not know what happened.

470
00:57:31,936 --> 00:57:34,084
The years of waiting.

471
00:57:38,311 --> 00:57:39,847
Of watching from the window. 480mm

472
00:57:41,184 --> 00:57:42,625
And waiting..

473
00:57:44,874 --> 00:57:46,314
Waiting..

474
00:58:06,341 --> 00:58:07,876
Have you seen her?

475
00:58:08,742 --> 00:58:10,037
Hanna!

476
00:58:11,129 --> 00:58:13,523
Can you tell me what she looks like?

477
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,280
Like her mother.

478
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:25,764
- Hanna?
- Yes

479
00:58:26,237 --> 00:58:27,772
Where do you really come from?

480
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:32,463
Leipzig. I live in Leipzig.

481
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:34,978
If we're going to be friends, you're
going to have to be honest with me.

482
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:36,592
Those are the rules.

483
00:58:38,283 --> 00:58:40,203
- Are we friends?
- Yes

484
00:58:40,829 --> 00:58:42,269
I like you.

485
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,211
I'd like to have a friend.

486
00:58:46,979 --> 00:58:49,475
I mean, you're a freak and
everything, but I like you.

487
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:54,232
I like you too. I really do.

488
00:58:54,233 --> 00:58:55,528
But

489
00:58:56,075 --> 00:58:57,996
There are things I can't tell you.

490
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:01,428
- Do you understand?
- Yes

491
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:05,430
Actually, no I don't.

492
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,579
There are peoples that want to harm me.

493
00:59:09,518 --> 00:59:11,632
- Bad peoples.
- I see.

494
00:59:11,633 --> 00:59:14,034
- And they won't stop.
- Right.

495
00:59:14,035 --> 00:59:16,723
So, for your own safety.

496
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,332
Can we still be friends?

497
00:59:22,852 --> 00:59:24,291
I don't know.

498
00:59:25,665 --> 00:59:27,680
I mean I don't really
know who you are, do I?

499
00:59:28,176 --> 00:59:29,615
That's just it.

500
00:59:30,888 --> 00:59:32,328
Neither do I.

501
00:59:38,152 --> 00:59:40,553
- What is it?
- It's something about me.

502
00:59:42,023 --> 00:59:46,441
I know what DNA means, but I
don't understand the rest of it.

503
00:59:46,442 --> 00:59:49,034
- Are you sick?
- I don't feel sick.

504
00:59:49,767 --> 00:59:51,879
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with me.

505
00:59:54,169 --> 00:59:55,609
What are you going to do?

506
00:59:58,665 --> 01:00:00,661
I'm going to Berlin.

507
01:00:01,153 --> 01:00:03,903
I have to meet meet my father
at the House of Wilhelm Grimm.

508
01:00:03,904 --> 01:00:05,921
From Grimms fairy tales?

509
01:00:06,294 --> 01:00:07,733
That's right.

510
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,411
If you say so.

511
01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:11,332
Did I say the wrong thing again?

512
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:20,321
Keep this.

513
01:00:20,322 --> 01:00:21,953
To remember me.

514
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,638
It's a friendship bracelet.

515
01:00:31,153 --> 01:00:32,592
Thank you.

516
01:01:11,246 --> 01:01:12,591
Where's Hanna?

517
01:01:12,592 --> 01:01:14,577
Wow, you look rough! Do want some tea?

518
01:01:14,578 --> 01:01:16,292
I had some. Who's Hanna?

519
01:01:16,293 --> 01:01:18,177
The girl we ate dinner with in Morocco.

520
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:20,569
She's here, or was. She
came out with me last night.

521
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:22,780
How did she get here?
Is she with her father?

522
01:01:22,781 --> 01:01:24,220
No, she came on her own.

523
01:01:24,663 --> 01:01:26,008
What?

524
01:01:26,009 --> 01:01:28,218
Look, other people have
their own style of parenting.

525
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:30,427
He's promoting independence.

526
01:01:30,428 --> 01:01:32,444
She's like an orphan!
Call me conservative.

527
01:01:32,445 --> 01:01:35,136
- Are you really conservative, darling?
- No I'm not.

528
01:01:35,137 --> 01:01:37,544
I said we'll give her a lift to
Lyon. We are going to Lyon, aren't we?

529
01:01:38,169 --> 01:01:39,870
- I found breakfast.

530
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,787
That's gross!

531
01:04:08,515 --> 01:04:10,723
We've got him! We have Heller.

532
01:04:40,775 --> 01:04:44,713
Do you read me? Bring him to
Wiegler. She will id an interview

533
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,882
- Is that what she said?
- Confirmed with her two minutes ago.

534
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:51,191
Marissa, damn it!

535
01:05:16,897 --> 01:05:19,716
I feel so grounded in the countryside.

536
01:05:21,615 --> 01:05:23,919
The city stifles me,

537
01:05:24,571 --> 01:05:27,162
emotionally, creatively, spiritually.

538
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:31,413
Places like this bring us closer to God.

539
01:05:31,962 --> 01:05:33,307
God?

540
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:35,228
Well, not any modernistic sense.

541
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:38,850
Buddha, Krishna, the God within.

542
01:05:39,822 --> 01:05:41,261
Whatever you believe in.

543
01:05:45,403 --> 01:05:47,035
What do you believe in, Hanna?

544
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,561
Nothing.

545
01:06:01,149 --> 01:06:02,684
Everything alright?

546
01:06:06,037 --> 01:06:07,476
I think so.

547
01:06:37,033 --> 01:06:40,011
I'm not sure if it's true
that the baby can hear me,

548
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:42,027
but at night I feel her.

549
01:06:42,379 --> 01:06:44,202
I hope she hears me.

550
01:06:44,342 --> 01:06:46,583
Was it like this for you, mama?

551
01:06:46,584 --> 01:06:49,537
I think I know what she looks like.

552
01:06:49,768 --> 01:06:52,458
I can see her when I close my eyes.

553
01:06:52,459 --> 01:06:56,300
I can hear her inside me.

554
01:06:56,818 --> 01:07:00,370
Do you think is that silly?
Oh, I think it's a girl.

555
01:07:00,669 --> 01:07:02,205
I hope so.

556
01:07:04,627 --> 01:07:06,068
Erik...

557
01:07:06,303 --> 01:07:07,598
What?

558
01:07:08,444 --> 01:07:09,760
Oh for Christ's sake, Lewis.

559
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:11,157
Hello, Marissa.

560
01:07:13,477 --> 01:07:15,281
I heard you were dead.

561
01:07:16,322 --> 01:07:18,134
Did your little girl tell you that?

562
01:07:19,049 --> 01:07:21,399
- What are you listening to?
- Self help.

563
01:07:22,403 --> 01:07:23,843
Are you in need of help?

564
01:07:25,196 --> 01:07:26,540
It's good to hear you.

565
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:29,916
I didn't imagine we'd
have the chance to talk.

566
01:07:29,917 --> 01:07:32,463
You don't have her, do
you? You're not that good.

567
01:07:32,464 --> 01:07:34,480
Oh, Erik! You're such a flirt.

568
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:40,254
- Tech's on the way.
- You were a good agent, Erik.

569
01:07:40,411 --> 01:07:42,908
Sad to see you go dumb.

570
01:07:45,454 --> 01:07:46,858
What did I miss?

571
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:48,561
I couldn't do it anymore.

572
01:07:48,591 --> 01:07:50,031
The things we did.

573
01:07:51,007 --> 01:07:53,230
I... I'm sorry with Johanna.

574
01:07:54,484 --> 01:07:56,962
With all of them. With Hanna.

575
01:07:58,242 --> 01:07:59,778
So, why come back now?

576
01:08:01,317 --> 01:08:02,661
Tech guys.

577
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,485
I asked you a question, Erik?

578
01:08:07,523 --> 01:08:09,442
Erik, are you still there?

579
01:08:47,579 --> 01:08:49,307
Move. Get up.

580
01:09:18,263 --> 01:09:21,240
Shit... shit... shit...

581
01:09:22,168 --> 01:09:23,609
Hanna, I think we're lost.

582
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,104
- I have to pull over.
- No, don't.

583
01:09:33,105 --> 01:09:34,544
Can't see the map.

584
01:09:49,973 --> 01:09:52,182
Have we stopped? I need to pee.

585
01:09:52,183 --> 01:09:54,844
Don't want you going
too far right now, love.

586
01:09:54,845 --> 01:09:56,478
I think you should stay
where you are, Sophie.

587
01:09:56,479 --> 01:09:57,919
Hanna, what's going on?

588
01:10:03,289 --> 01:10:05,018
Keep calm.

589
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:19,429
- Are we are in Lyon?
- No we're not.

590
01:10:20,597 --> 01:10:23,190
Whatever you do, don't follow me!

591
01:10:23,745 --> 01:10:25,186
Promise not to follow me.

592
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:26,915
I promise.

593
01:10:36,513 --> 01:10:38,529
Thank you for being my friend.

594
01:10:41,182 --> 01:10:42,477
Hanna!

595
01:10:42,524 --> 01:10:43,965
Come on, come on!

596
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:49,065
Silence! Shut up

597
01:12:21,044 --> 01:12:22,340
Hanna.

598
01:14:37,664 --> 01:14:40,448
Definitely odd. Disconnected.

599
01:14:41,668 --> 01:14:44,809
You know, I like to think that
I have a rapport with kids.

600
01:14:45,154 --> 01:14:46,680
You know, I get with them.

601
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:51,455
You know, sir, it's days like
this that I really hate my job.

602
01:14:52,841 --> 01:14:56,019
- Yeah, I'm sure you do..
- This is very, very difficult.

603
01:14:57,777 --> 01:15:00,527
But sometimes children
are bad people too.

604
01:15:00,528 --> 01:15:03,243
- Stop crying.
- I'm not telling you anything!

605
01:15:03,244 --> 01:15:04,684
- Do you know this boy?
- No!

606
01:15:04,685 --> 01:15:08,431
He knows you. Your friend
is in a lot of danger.

607
01:15:08,432 --> 01:15:09,880
I don't know anything!

608
01:15:10,816 --> 01:15:12,644
She said she lived in Leipzig.

609
01:15:12,645 --> 01:15:16,283
She went to The Klaus College Gymnazium.
Her friends were Rudy and Gunter

610
01:15:16,284 --> 01:15:18,589
She likes tennis and she
has a dog named Trudy.

611
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:20,990
- She lied to you.
- Absolutely.

612
01:15:21,245 --> 01:15:24,268
It is not lost, but we must act very
carefully. But she needed taken care of.

613
01:15:25,093 --> 01:15:26,807
I've got something to show you.

614
01:15:26,905 --> 01:15:29,594
- A little help from mom.
- This is Hanna's mother.

615
01:15:29,595 --> 01:15:30,940
Biological mother.

616
01:15:30,941 --> 01:15:34,457
15 years ago, she was shot
to death by Hanna's father

617
01:15:34,458 --> 01:15:35,993
on a camping trip.

618
01:15:37,595 --> 01:15:39,418
Don't you wanna see what's inside?

619
01:15:42,044 --> 01:15:44,253
- Say "Please. "
- Please.

620
01:16:11,049 --> 01:16:12,585
You like her, don't you?

621
01:16:12,702 --> 01:16:15,103
It's okay. I won't tell anyone.

622
01:16:16,611 --> 01:16:18,051
She's very pretty.

623
01:16:18,967 --> 01:16:21,360
- Where is she?
- You tell me.

624
01:16:21,531 --> 01:16:24,651
- Is she in lots of trouble?
- The worst kind, sweetheart.

625
01:16:24,652 --> 01:16:26,957
Some very bad men are looking for her,

626
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:28,782
and I need to find her.
I wanna protect her.

627
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,307
Do you want her to get hurt?

628
01:16:37,815 --> 01:16:38,488
No.

629
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:43,263
She's going to Berlin.
To Wilhelm Grimm's house.

630
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:44,747
To meet her dad.

631
01:18:24,044 --> 01:18:27,885
Hanna. Hanna... Hanna come, come.

632
01:18:29,945 --> 01:18:31,385
This way.

633
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,919
Been waiting for you a long time.

634
01:18:39,616 --> 01:18:41,536
What did Erik told you about me?

635
01:18:41,794 --> 01:18:44,644
Wilhelm Grimm's House Stefan Straza,

636
01:18:44,645 --> 01:18:47,156
21610559, Berlin, Germany.

637
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:49,350
That's it.

638
01:18:50,034 --> 01:18:53,604
He didn't tell you of my magic.

639
01:19:04,871 --> 01:19:07,122
Klaus, 09/05. Be there Tuesday. Erik.

640
01:19:08,932 --> 01:19:10,796
- What day is it?
- It's today, my dear.

641
01:19:10,797 --> 01:19:13,486
Come, come. 650mm

642
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,760
Sit.

643
01:19:27,297 --> 01:19:28,737
Sit.

644
01:19:29,236 --> 01:19:31,252
Oh, you're hungry.

645
01:19:39,245 --> 01:19:41,261
- Waffles.
- May I have one?

646
01:19:41,304 --> 01:19:43,224
An egg? Of course.

647
01:19:45,201 --> 01:19:47,122
You can eat whatever you want, my dear.

648
01:19:47,123 --> 01:19:48,668
My shoe!

649
01:19:49,482 --> 01:19:50,921
Oh, I've almost forgotten.

650
01:19:55,543 --> 01:19:56,983
A present.

651
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:00,956
For me?

652
01:20:04,858 --> 01:20:08,013
You will need a fresh photograph.
But everything's in order, yes?

653
01:20:08,014 --> 01:20:10,703
Why do I need a piece of
paper to tell me my name?

654
01:20:10,704 --> 01:20:12,746
Not you, not you my dear.

655
01:20:12,747 --> 01:20:16,275
But everyone else we
need paper and computers,

656
01:20:16,276 --> 01:20:19,832
so we don't have to ask people
their names to look them in the face.

657
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:25,497
You have a good face.

658
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,431
You look just like your father.

659
01:20:28,405 --> 01:20:30,036
And you walk like him too, uh uh uh.

660
01:20:31,241 --> 01:20:34,680
- I don't walk like that.
- Yes, you do! You do, my dear! Uh uh.

661
01:20:41,746 --> 01:20:43,377
Did you know my mother too?

662
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:46,989
But, of course.

663
01:20:48,149 --> 01:20:52,278
She was a singer. A wonderful singer.

664
01:20:54,093 --> 01:20:55,533
Do you sing?

665
01:20:56,463 --> 01:20:59,342
Papa.. Erik, didn't teach me.

666
01:20:59,592 --> 01:21:01,031
Oh, you poor child.

667
01:21:01,837 --> 01:21:03,469
He has truely limited you

668
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:06,351
from all the wonderful
things the world has to offer.

669
01:21:07,149 --> 01:21:08,516
No magic.

670
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:10,974
No music.

671
01:21:38,157 --> 01:21:39,597
I'll teach you.

672
01:21:44,177 --> 01:21:45,617
Is that him?

673
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:51,886
Upstairs with you, my dear Quickly.

674
01:22:04,575 --> 01:22:06,206
Good day.

675
01:22:06,787 --> 01:22:09,281
We're closed, boys and girl.

676
01:22:14,756 --> 01:22:16,196
Where is Erik?

677
01:22:55,769 --> 01:22:57,673
He doesn't know much

678
01:22:57,677 --> 01:22:59,308
or he is a very good liar.

679
01:23:00,335 --> 01:23:01,679
He knew Johanna.

680
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:04,464
- Yes, of course.
- Bits and pieces about the programme.

681
01:23:04,669 --> 01:23:08,125
- What does he know about the girl?
- He thinks Erik's the father.

682
01:23:08,995 --> 01:23:11,945
- Everybody thinks Erik's the father.
- That's precious!

683
01:23:12,542 --> 01:23:15,229
Yes? This is Marissa Wiegler.

684
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,086
Walt, I didn't recog...

685
01:23:18,087 --> 01:23:19,655
Lewis is dead.

686
01:23:19,656 --> 01:23:21,876
Do you think it's important to tell us?

687
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:23,172
Why didn't you call us yet?

688
01:23:23,391 --> 01:23:26,175
One man, One-day operation.

689
01:23:28,642 --> 01:23:31,406
Yes. Yes. Yes! We all want, Lewis.

690
01:23:34,532 --> 01:23:36,409
He was shooting through the door, Walt.

691
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:40,224
No, I'm not standing down...

692
01:23:41,962 --> 01:23:43,401
No, I'm interest..

693
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:47,732
Well, yes.

694
01:23:51,761 --> 01:23:55,318
No, listen, Walt.

695
01:25:22,941 --> 01:25:24,315
Heizinger.

696
01:25:41,482 --> 01:25:45,252
So off to grandmother's house, we go.

697
01:26:48,533 --> 01:26:50,550
Have you seen her?

698
01:26:50,888 --> 01:26:52,328
Hanna!

699
01:26:55,434 --> 01:26:56,874
SOUGHT

700
01:27:06,165 --> 01:27:07,605
Sit down.

701
01:27:10,611 --> 01:27:12,051
Are you my father?

702
01:27:13,672 --> 01:27:14,922
Sit down, Hanna.

703
01:27:14,923 --> 01:27:17,257
- Are you my father?
- Please, sit.

704
01:27:17,258 --> 01:27:18,554
Are you?

705
01:27:18,589 --> 01:27:21,470
Hanna, of course I'm your father.

706
01:27:22,908 --> 01:27:25,038
- I raised you.
- But Marissa said...

707
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:26,783
- Hanna!
- Don't lie to me!

708
01:27:28,323 --> 01:27:31,428
I'm your father. I've been
with you your whole life.

709
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:34,016
Treated you like my own flesh and blood.

710
01:27:34,051 --> 01:27:35,794
But I was not your flesh and your blood.

711
01:27:37,897 --> 01:27:39,621
- I am abnormal?
- No!

712
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:41,024
Where was I born?

713
01:27:44,866 --> 01:27:46,306
Tell me the truth.

714
01:27:48,857 --> 01:27:50,970
You were born in a research facility.

715
01:27:51,951 --> 01:27:53,259
In rural Poland, Galinki.

716
01:27:54,873 --> 01:27:56,314
What was the research?

717
01:27:56,877 --> 01:27:58,431
They took fertilized embryo's

718
01:27:58,466 --> 01:28:01,298
and made small changes
to them to improve them.

719
01:28:01,299 --> 01:28:04,413
To reduce the capacity
for fear, for pity,

720
01:28:04,414 --> 01:28:06,385
to increase muscle strength,

721
01:28:06,386 --> 01:28:09,820
heightened senses. Anything
to make a better soldier.

722
01:28:10,415 --> 01:28:11,711
The perfect soldier.

723
01:28:15,421 --> 01:28:17,629
I've recruited your mother
in an abortion clinic.

724
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:20,694
I've recruited twenty
women the same way.

725
01:28:24,697 --> 01:28:27,289
- There were other children?
- Yes

726
01:28:28,902 --> 01:28:30,680
When you were two,

727
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:32,457
Marissa Wiegler, she
closed the whole programme

728
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:34,443
and all of this research,

729
01:28:35,573 --> 01:28:37,187
it was disposed of.

730
01:28:37,682 --> 01:28:39,121
Do you understand?

731
01:28:44,034 --> 01:28:47,516
I love you, Hanna.
You have to know that.

732
01:28:50,795 --> 01:28:52,427
Because I'm a freak?

733
01:28:53,668 --> 01:28:55,109
No.

734
01:28:55,759 --> 01:28:57,487
Because you are my child.

735
01:29:05,332 --> 01:29:06,963
Where are you going?

736
01:29:09,353 --> 01:29:10,698
Stop this.

737
01:29:10,699 --> 01:29:12,140
Let me go!

738
01:29:25,858 --> 01:29:27,299
Stop this.

739
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,491
Hanna! Hanna, please!

740
01:29:42,969 --> 01:29:46,235
I tried to prepare for what
that would be your life.

741
01:29:46,651 --> 01:29:48,379
You didn't prepare me for this.

742
01:29:52,604 --> 01:29:54,044
Run!

743
01:29:55,337 --> 01:29:56,777
Run!

744
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:07,671
Take it.

745
01:30:23,935 --> 01:30:26,720
That's all you got?

746
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:29,414
Run, pig!

747
01:32:23,398 --> 01:32:25,126
Why now, Erik?

748
01:32:29,063 --> 01:32:30,503
Kids grow up.

749
01:33:04,619 --> 01:33:06,155
Mr. Grimm!

750
01:33:08,622 --> 01:33:10,015
Mr. Grimm!

751
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:11,409
Mr. Grimm.

752
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:22,606
Hanna

753
01:34:36,144 --> 01:34:37,585
I'm here, Hanna.

754
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:03,700
Oh, don't worry sweetheart.

755
01:36:03,701 --> 01:36:06,896
Don't! Don't move any closer!

756
01:36:09,035 --> 01:36:11,926
Hanna, I can help you.

757
01:36:12,489 --> 01:36:13,788
Please!

758
01:36:14,987 --> 01:36:16,856
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore..

759
01:36:18,651 --> 01:36:20,204
I just wanna talk.

760
01:36:21,697 --> 01:36:23,143
It's over now, Marissa.

761
01:36:27,571 --> 01:36:29,017
Let me go.

762
01:36:30,617 --> 01:36:32,064
Hanna!

763
01:36:32,989 --> 01:36:35,356
Don't walk away from me, young lady!

764
01:39:02,832 --> 01:39:04,541
I just missed your heart
