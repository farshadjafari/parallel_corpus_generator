1
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,525
Harry, answer that.

2
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,738
So, what do you wanna
hack for, Bickle?

3
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,406
I can't sleep nights.

4
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:41,369
- There's porno theaters for that.
- Yeah, I know. I tried that.

5
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,667
So, what do you do now?

6
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:51,754
Now? Ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses.

7
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,882
Figure I'm gonna do that,
I might as well get paid for it.

8
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,426
You wanna work uptown?
South Bronx, Harlem?

9
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,345
I'll work anytime, anywhere.

10
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,013
Will you work Jewish holidays?

11
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,932
Anytime, anywhere.

12
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,560
All right.
Let me see your chauffeur's license.

13
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,606
- How's your driving record?
- It's clean.

14
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,984
It's real clean, like my conscience.

15
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,988
You gonna break my chops? I got
enough trouble with guys like you.

16
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,575
If you're gonna break my chops,
you can take it on the arches.

17
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,160
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean that.

18
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,539
- Physical?
- Clean.

19
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,541
- Age?
- Twenty-six.

20
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,459
Education?

21
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,128
Some.

22
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,422
Here, there, you know.

23
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,719
Military record?

24
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,138
Honorable discharge.

25
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,640
May 1973.

26
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,851
- Were you in the Army?
- Marines.

27
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,105
I was in the Marines too.

28
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,484
So, what is it?

29
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,778
You need an extra job?

30
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,281
Are you moonlighting?

31
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,285
Well, I...
I just wanna work long hours.

32
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,953
What's moonlighting?

33
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,290
Look, just fill out these forms
and check back tomorrow...

34
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,459
...when the shift breaks.

35
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,294
O'Brien, please step up.

36
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,047
Take the car out
through 58th Street, please.

37
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,090
Because it's crowded on 57th.

38
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,761
Hey, Rodriguez!

39
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,771
All right, all right,
I'm coming down there.

40
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,356
May 10th.

41
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,817
Thank God for the rain,
which has washed away...

42
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,320
...the garbage and the trash
off the sidewalks.

43
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,115
I'm working long hours now.

44
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:28,119
Six in the afternoon to 6 in the morning,
sometimes even 8 in the morning.

45
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,455
Six days a week,
sometimes seven days a week.

46
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,583
It's a long hustle,
but it keeps me real busy.

47
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,044
I can take in $300,
$350 a week.

48
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,839
Sometimes even more
when I do it off the meter.

49
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,283
All the animals come out at night.

50
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:12,538
Whores, skunk-pussies, buggers,
queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.

51
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,708
Sick, venal.

52
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:23,299
Someday a real rain'll come and
wash all this scum off the streets.

53
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:35,269
I go all over. I take people to the
Bronx, Brooklyn. I take them to Harlem.

54
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,439
I don't care.
Don't make no difference to me.

55
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,234
It does to some.
Some won't even take spooks.

56
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,028
Don't make no difference to me.

57
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,863
Driver, 48th and 6th, please.

58
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:50,159
Man, you are gorgeous!
Beautiful little girl.

59
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,955
I can't afford
to get stopped anywhere.

60
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,333
Oh, no.
We wouldn't want that to happen.

61
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,253
There'll be a big tip in it for you,
you do the right things.

62
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:05,049
You got a way.

63
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,719
Yeah. Now you're talking!

64
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,430
Driver, hurry up, will you?

65
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,137
Each night when I return the cab...

66
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,181
...I have to clean the come
off the back seat.

67
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,480
Some nights, I clean off the blood.

68
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,348
Can I help you?

69
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,601
Yeah, what's your name?

70
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,186
My name is Travis.

71
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,189
That's nice.
What can I do for you?

72
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,234
I'd like to know what your name is.
What's your name?

73
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,486
Give me a break.

74
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,616
Look, you can tell me what your
name is. I'm not gonna do anything.

75
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,453
- Do you want me to call the manager?
- You don't have to call the manager.

76
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:01,123
- Troy!
- All right. Okay, I mean...

77
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,502
Okay. Can I have a Chuckles there?

78
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,799
And do you have any Jujubes? They
last longer. I'd like to get some Jujubes.

79
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,219
What you see is what we got.

80
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,892
A Clark.

81
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,854
I'll take these.

82
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,691
Coca-Cola.

83
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,779
We don't have Coca-Cola.
Royal Crown Cola is all we got.

84
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,115
A dollar eighty-five.

85
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,557
Twelve hours of work
and I still can't sleep.

86
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,685
Damn.

87
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,981
The days go on and on.
And they don't end.

88
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,860
All my life needed was
a sense of some place to go.

89
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:16,448
I don't believe that one should devote
his life to morbid self-attention.

90
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,994
I believe that someone should
become a person like other people.

91
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:27,293
I first saw her at Palantine campaign
headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.

92
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,255
She was wearing a white dress.

93
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,924
She appeared like an angel...

94
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,052
...out of this filthy mass.

95
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,138
She is alone.

96
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,849
They...

97
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,726
...cannot...

98
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,602
...touch...

99
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,688
...her.

100
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,077
Yes. Well, you delivered two boxes.

101
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,039
I think it's a total
of 5000 campaign buttons.

102
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,584
Now, all the ones we had before
and our slogan is:

103
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,503
"We are the people,"
and "are" is underlined.

104
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,214
These new buttons
have "we" underlined.

105
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:19,011
That reads, "We are the people."
Well, I think there's a difference.

106
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,140
"We are the people" is not
the same as "We are the people."

107
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,434
Let's not fight.

108
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,354
Look, we'll make it real simple.

109
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,689
We don't pay for the buttons.

110
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,235
- We throw the buttons away, all right?
- Tom, come here a minute.

111
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,155
What?

112
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,871
What is it?

113
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,459
If Andy okays this canvass report,
send a copy to all headquarters.

114
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,961
I gotta get that New York Times article
xeroxed.

115
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,714
- Don't forget the new photos.
- I didn't forget.

116
00:11:55,924 --> 00:12:00,177
We have to emphasize mandatory
welfare. That's the issue to push.

117
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,262
First push the man, then the issue.

118
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,473
Senator Palantine is a dynamic man.

119
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,726
An intelligent, interesting,
fresh, fascinating man.

120
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,103
You forgot sexy.

121
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,687
I did not forget sexy.

122
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,524
Listen to you. You sound
like you're selling mouthwash.

123
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,900
We are selling mouthwash.

124
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,069
- Are we authorized to do that?
- Very funny.

125
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,489
You can get in trouble selling
pharmaceuticals in a campaign office.

126
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,200
My uncle's in jail because of that.

127
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:27,538
It's not really jail. Of course, living
with his wife, anything would be jail.

128
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,039
Look over there.

129
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,499
I love you.

130
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,834
Notice anything?

131
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,253
- No.
- Well, put your glasses on.

132
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,047
Okay, just a minute. All right.

133
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,550
That taxi driver's been staring at us.

134
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,102
What taxi driver?

135
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,438
That one, the one that's sitting there.

136
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,024
- How long has he been there?
- I don't know. It feels like a long time.

137
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,069
- Does he bother you?
- No.

138
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,363
You mean yes,
and you're being sarcastic.

139
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,449
Oh, you're quick.
You're really quick.

140
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,200
Well, I try to be real quick.

141
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,661
I'll play the male
in this relationship...

142
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,121
Good luck.

143
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,666
- And tell him to move. And I don't
need good luck. Thank you.

144
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,627
Oh, yes, you do.
You just think you don't.

145
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,639
Say, you're blocking our doorway.
You think you might move your cab?

146
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,076
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

147
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,786
...lipstick, rouge.

148
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,872
Not rouge. Blush-on, they call it.

149
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,460
- The kind with the brush.
- Yeah, it's Blush-on.

150
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,338
Travis.

151
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,342
- Hey, Wiz.
- That's Blush-on. My wife uses it.

152
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,636
Ask Travis. He's a ladies' man.

153
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,264
A cup of coffee, please.

154
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,267
Anyway, whatever the fuck it is,
she uses a lot of it.

155
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,894
And then perfume. The spray kind.

156
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,606
Get this. In the middle
of the Triborough Bridge...

157
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:44,026
And this woman is beautiful.
- She changes her pantyhose.

158
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,527
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

159
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,822
- What'd you do?
- I throw the meter, you know...

160
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,410
...and I jump in the back seat and whip
it out. I said, "You know what this is?"

161
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,413
She says, "It's love."
I'm gonna fuck her brains out.

162
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,248
She goes wild and she said:

163
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,168
"That's the greatest
single experience of my life."

164
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,921
Then she gave me a $200 tip
and her phone number in Acapulco.

165
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,425
Travis, you know Doughboy,
Charlie T?

166
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,846
Hey, Travis.
Got change for a nickel?

167
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,432
Doughboy'll do anything for a buck.

168
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,686
So how's it hanging?

169
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,317
What's that?

170
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:32,199
I turn on the radio. Some fleet driver
from Bell just got all cut up.

171
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,492
Stickup?

172
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,412
No, he got cut up by some
crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.

173
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:41,249
- Where?
- It was at 122nd Street.

174
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,835
Fucking Mau Mau land.

175
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,133
You run all over town,
don't you, Travis?

176
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,595
Travis?

177
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,351
Travis.

178
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,521
- You run all over town, don't you?
- Yeah.

179
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,065
You handle some
pretty rough customers, huh?

180
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,817
Yeah, I have.

181
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,278
- You carry a piece?
- No.

182
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,572
- You need one?
- No.

183
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,992
I know a fella who can get you
a real nice deal.

184
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,078
There's lots of shit around.

185
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,747
I never use mine.
I'm conservative, you know.

186
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,835
But it's a good thing to have
just as a threat.

187
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,098
I'm gonna go dig my dirt.

188
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,976
Travis.

189
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,729
Look.

190
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,065
Piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.

191
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,192
Dig the symbols.

192
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:53,238
F-4-0-5-4-3-4.

193
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,241
And the watermark.

194
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,160
There's one person...

195
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,036
...there's two persons...

196
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,747
...and there's three persons.

197
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,166
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

198
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,626
Why don't you take it,
and if you can sell it...

199
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,630
...you give me half of what you got.
- I don't want to.

200
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,550
Hey, I'm gonna get in my cab
and boogie.

201
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,984
- Oh, I'm so terribly sorry.
- Well...

202
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,030
- Nothing.
- That's very cute. Thank you.

203
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,115
Hey, you wanna see something?

204
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,869
Wait, I just typed,
"You wanna see something?"

205
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,872
- What?
- If you had...

206
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,333
...these three fingers
missing on this hand...

207
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,794
...and that hand missing
on that hand...

208
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,672
...how would you light the match?
- I wouldn't.

209
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,050
Go ahead. Give it a try.

210
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,012
Well, I don't think I could do it.

211
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,514
No?

212
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,390
It's gonna be difficult.

213
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,434
I'll give it a try.

214
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,278
I got my thumb back for a second.
Thank God.

215
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,989
Just a minute.

216
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,040
I can't do it.

217
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,292
The guy at the newsstand can do it.

218
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,545
Well, I don't work at a newsstand.

219
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,798
- Anyway, he's probably Italian.
- No.

220
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,591
- You're sure?
- He's black.

221
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:40,136
If he had been Italian, he might've been
a thief. The mob does that.

222
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,974
If a thief screws up on the job,
they'll blow his fingers off.

223
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,726
This sounds like a joke,
but it's true.

224
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:50,105
If they kill a stool pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.

225
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,608
- It's symbolic.
- Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

226
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,528
I don't know why not a pigeon.
Wait a minute.

227
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,615
You gotta catch a pigeon. A canary,
you can walk into a pet store...

228
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,618
...boom, kill it right there.
Put it on anyone you want.

229
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,940
- Hi. I'd like to volunteer.
- Great. I'll take you right over here.

230
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,818
I'd rather volunteer to her,
if you don't mind.

231
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,908
Why do you feel
you have to volunteer to me?

232
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:47,245
Because I think that you are the most
beautiful woman I have ever seen.

233
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,041
Thanks.

234
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,501
But what do you think of Palantine?

235
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,715
Well, I...

236
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,177
Palantine, the man you're volunteering
to help elect president.

237
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,597
I'm sure he'll make a good president.

238
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:09,184
I don't know what his policies are,
but I'm sure he'll make a good one.

239
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,271
- You wanna canvass?
- Yeah, I'll canvass.

240
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,066
How do you feel about
the senator's stand on welfare?

241
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,737
I don't really know his stand on
welfare, but I'm sure it's a good stand.

242
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,865
- You're sure of that?
- Yeah.

243
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,536
We all work together here,
day and night...

244
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,915
...so I'm sure the gentlemen
will sign you up over there.

245
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:36,670
The thing is, I drive a taxi at night,
so it's kind of hard for me...

246
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,047
...to work in the day.

247
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,300
Then what exactly do you want?

248
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,261
Would you like to come have
some coffee and pie with me?

249
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,721
Why?

250
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,140
- Why? I'll tell you why.
- Yeah.

251
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,435
I think you're a lonely person.

252
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,271
I drive by a lot, and I see you here.

253
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,482
I see a lot of people around you...

254
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,777
...and I see these phones
and all this stuff on your desk...

255
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,320
...that means nothing.

256
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,656
And when I came inside and met you...

257
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,617
...I saw in your eyes
and how you carried yourself...

258
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,036
...that you're not a happy person.

259
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,414
And I think you need something.

260
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:15,500
And if you wanna call it a friend,
you can call it a friend.

261
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,796
- You're gonna be my friend?
- Yeah.

262
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,180
What do you say?

263
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:37,022
It's a little hard standing here
and asking you, so...

264
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,988
Five minutes, that's all.
Just outside. Right around here.

265
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,906
I'm there to protect you.

266
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,248
Come on. Just take a little break.

267
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,503
I have a break at 4:00.
And if you're here...

268
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,756
- 4:00 today?
- Yes.

269
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,884
- I'll be here.
- I'm sure you will.

270
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:09,012
- All right, 4 p.m.
- Right.

271
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,056
- Outside in the front?
- Yes.

272
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,474
Okay.

273
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,101
Oh, my name is Travis. Betsy?

274
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,937
Travis.

275
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,690
I appreciate this, Betsy.

276
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,624
May 26th, 4:00 p.m.

277
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,753
I took Betsy to Charles' Coffee Shop
on Columbus Circle.

278
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:47,383
I had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese.

279
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,844
I think that was a good selection.

280
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,388
Betsy had coffee
and a fruit salad dish.

281
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,516
She could've had
anything she wanted.

282
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,435
Fifteen thousand volunteers
in New York alone's not bad.

283
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,479
But the organizational problems.

284
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,609
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I got the same problems.

285
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,906
I gotta get organized. Little things,
like my apartment, my possessions.

286
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,536
I should get one of those signs: "One
of these days, I'll get organiz-ized."

287
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,412
You mean "organized"?

288
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,498
Organiz-ized.

289
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,167
Organiz-ized. It's a joke.

290
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,629
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

291
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,134
You mean "organiz-ize." Like those
little signs in offices that say, "Thimk."

292
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,724
Do you like where you work?

293
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,063
We've got some good people. And
I think Palantine's got a good chance.

294
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,278
You know you have beautiful eyes?

295
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,953
Do you like the guy you work with?

296
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,788
He's okay.

297
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,041
Yeah, I know.
But do you like him?

298
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:07,005
He's funny, good at his job. He's okay.
Though he does have a few problems.

299
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,382
I would say
he has quite a few problems.

300
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:14,179
His energy seems to go
in the wrong places.

301
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,599
When I walked in and I saw
you two sitting there...

302
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,685
...I could just tell
that there was no connection...

303
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,270
...whatsoever.

304
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,732
And I felt when I walked in,
there was something between us.

305
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,651
There was an impulse
that we were both following.

306
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:31,571
So that gave me the right
to talk to you.

307
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,533
Otherwise, I never would've felt
that I had the right to talk to you.

308
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,745
I never would've had
the courage to talk to you.

309
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,123
And with him,
I felt there was nothing.

310
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,418
When I walked in, I knew I was right.
Did you feel that way?

311
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,299
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

312
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:54,886
Where are you from?

313
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,596
Upstate.

314
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,310
That fellow, I don't like him.

315
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,521
Not that I don't like him,
I just think he's silly.

316
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,235
I don't think he respects you.

317
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:14,489
I don't believe I've ever met
anyone quite like you.

318
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,543
You wanna go to...

319
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,546
...a movie with me?

320
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:35,051
- I have to go back to work now.
- I don't mean now. Another time?

321
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,018
Sure.
You know what you remind me of?

322
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,355
- What?
- That song...

323
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,609
...by Kris Kristofferson.

324
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:57,198
- Who's that?
- The songwriter.

325
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,950
"He's a prophet...

326
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,910
He's a prophet and a pusher...

327
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,164
...partly truth, partly fiction,
a walking contradiction."

328
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,251
You saying that about me?

329
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,169
Who else would I be talking about?

330
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,463
I'm no pusher.
I've never pushed.

331
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,384
No, just the part
about the contradictions.

332
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,428
You are that.

333
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:52,837
I called Betsy again at her office.
She said maybe we'd go to a movie...

334
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,965
...after work tomorrow.
That's my day off.

335
00:27:56,216 --> 00:28:00,345
At first she hesitated,
but I called her again and she agreed.

336
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,514
Betsy, Betsy. Oh, no.

337
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:06,434
Betsy what?
I forgot to ask her last name.

338
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,937
Damn! I gotta remember
stuff like that.

339
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,785
Don't worry about anyone
committing themselves...

340
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,662
...until things start coming in
from California.

341
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,791
Listen, I think we should've
waited for the limo.

342
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,793
I don't mind the cab,
but I mind...

343
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,797
...going to California without the right
preparation. That'll get us in trouble.

344
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,049
Are you Charles Palantine,
the candidate?

345
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,677
Yes, I am.

346
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,305
I'm a big supporter.

347
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,975
I tell everybody that comes in this taxi
they have to vote for you.

348
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,769
Why, thank you...

349
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,897
...Travis.

350
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,025
I'm sure you'll win.
Everybody I know's gonna vote for you.

351
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,653
I was gonna put one of
your stickers in my taxi...

352
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,781
...but the company said
it was against their policy.

353
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,616
They're a bunch ofjerks.

354
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,661
Let me tell you, I have learned
more about America...

355
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,081
...from riding in taxicabs than
in all the limos in the country.

356
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,794
- Oh, yeah?
- That's true.

357
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,839
- Can I ask you something, Travis?
- Sure.

358
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:21,217
What is the one thing about this
country that bugs you the most?

359
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:27,723
Well, I don't know. I don't follow
political issues that closely, sir.

360
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,435
Oh, well, there must be something.

361
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,814
Well, whatever it is, he should
clean up this city here...

362
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:39,527
...because this city here's like an
open sewer. It's full of filth and scum.

363
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,821
Sometimes I can hardly take it.

364
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:45,032
Whatever ever becomes the president
should just...

365
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,785
...really clean it up.
Know what I mean?

366
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,664
Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.

367
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,959
And they just like... They just
never go away, you know?

368
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,545
I think that the president
should just...

369
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:02,550
...clean up this mess. He should
flush it right down the fucking toilet.

370
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,186
Well, I think I know
what you mean, Travis.

371
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,438
But it's not gonna be easy.

372
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,108
- We'll have to make radical changes.
- Damn straight.

373
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,528
Here you go, Travis.
Keep the change.

374
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,030
Thank you.

375
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,577
- Nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.

376
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,163
You're a good man.
I know you're gonna win.

377
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,373
Thank you. Drive safe.

378
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,482
Come on, man.
Get me out of here, all right?

379
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,695
Come on!

380
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,198
Come on, baby.
This is a real drag.

381
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:10,034
Now, come on!
Come on, don't make no scene.

382
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,120
You wanna get busted?

383
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,622
Now, bitch, be cool!

384
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,591
Don't start no trouble.

385
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,761
Cabbie, forget about this.
It's nothing.

386
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,221
Be cool, bitch!

387
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,483
- Stop!
- Wanna hear something?

388
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,032
What's the matter, baby?

389
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,402
Get your ass out of here!

390
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,848
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

391
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,352
- Have a nice day today?
- Not particularly.

392
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,229
I got a present for you.

393
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:51,153
Now back to Gene Krupa's
syncopated style shortly.

394
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,538
Why'd you do that?

395
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,666
What else am I gonna do
with my money?

396
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,168
I wish you'd have listened to this.

397
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,755
I would have, except my record
player doesn't work now.

398
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,215
Your stereo's broken?

399
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,884
How can you stand it?
I can't live without music.

400
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:17,763
I don't follow music too much,
but I would really like to.

401
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,890
Then you haven't played
this record yet?

402
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,559
No.

403
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:27,064
But I was thinking maybe we could
listen to it on your record player.

404
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,985
Now, going back to
40 years of Chick Webb.

405
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,753
You gotta be kidding.

406
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:52,256
- What?
- This is a dirty movie.

407
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,677
No, no. This is a movie
that a lot of couples come to.

408
00:34:56,887 --> 00:35:00,806
- All kinds of couples go here.
- You sure about that?

409
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,726
Yeah, I see them all the time.

410
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,105
Come on.

411
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,314
Shut the fuck up.

412
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,775
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.

413
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,277
- Why?
- I don't know why I came in here.

414
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,780
- I don't like these movies.
- Well, I mean...

415
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,908
I didn't know you'd feel
that way about this movie.

416
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,036
- If I had known...
- These the only movies you go to?

417
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,248
Yeah, I mean I come and...
This is not so bad.

418
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,293
Taking me to a place like this is as
exciting to me as saying, "Let's fuck."

419
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,300
There are other places
I can take you.

420
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,637
I don't know much about them,
but I can take you other places.

421
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,639
We're just different.

422
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,433
- Wait a second.
- I have to go.

423
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:27,852
- I've gotta go now.
- Wait.

424
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:31,689
- Wait a second, I wanna talk to you.
- Look, I have to go.

425
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,399
Taxi!

426
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,778
Can I talk to you at least? Won't you at
least talk to me? I didn't know you'd...

427
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,321
Won't you take the record?

428
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,866
- I've already got it.
- But, please.

429
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:46,078
- I bought it for you, Betsy.
- Now I've got two. Let's go.

430
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:47,997
Can I call you?

431
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,333
Jesus Christ, I got a taxi.

432
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,799
Hello, Betsy.

433
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,718
Hi, it's Travis.

434
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,556
How you doing? Listen,
I'm sorry about the other night.

435
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,851
I didn't know that was
the way you felt about it.

436
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:15,733
Well, I didn't know. If I... I would
have taken you somewhere else.

437
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,069
Are you feeling better or?

438
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,657
Maybe you had a virus or something.
A 24-hour virus, you know.

439
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,160
It can happen. Yeah.

440
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,459
You've been working hard, huh?
Yeah.

441
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,799
Would you like to have
some dinner with me...

442
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:43,677
...in the next few days or something?

443
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,307
How about just a cup of coffee?

444
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:52,645
I could come by the headquarters
or something, and we could...

445
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,356
Okay, okay.

446
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,569
Did you get my flowers in the?

447
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:06,825
You didn't get them?
But I sent some flowers.

448
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,123
Yeah. Well... Okay, okay.

449
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,376
Can I call you again?

450
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,337
Tomorrow or the next day?
Okay.

451
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:21,423
No, I'm gonna...
Okay, yeah, sure. Okay.

452
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,092
So long.

453
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,346
I tried several times to call her...

454
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:31,433
...but after the first call, she wouldn't
come to the phone any longer.

455
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,269
I also sent flowers,
but with no luck.

456
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,106
The smell of the flowers
only made me sicker.

457
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:41,860
The headaches got worse.
I think I got stomach cancer.

458
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,571
I shouldn't complain, though.

459
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,074
You're only as healthy...

460
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,411
You're only as healthy as you feel.

461
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,122
You're only...

462
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,040
...as healthy...

463
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,667
...as...

464
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,460
...you...

465
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,045
...feel.

466
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:14,018
- Let's not have any trouble, okay?
- Why won't you talk to me?

467
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,687
You think I don't know you're here?

468
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,939
You think I don't know?

469
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,816
- Please leave.
- Take your hands off!

470
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,193
I just want you to know...

471
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,863
Please, just leave.
This is no place to do this.

472
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,156
Take your hands off me.

473
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,033
- Take your hands off!
- Just leave.

474
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,369
- All right, just leave, then.
- I'm gonna tell you...

475
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,205
...you're in a hell!
You'll die in hell like the rest.

476
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:38,167
- Come on. There's a cop.
- You're like the rest of them.

477
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,711
Look, I'm calling the cop.
Officer!

478
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,090
Officer!

479
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:50,054
Look, don't come around here,
because I'll call the police!

480
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:55,976
I realize now how much she's just
like the others, cold and distant.

481
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:57,853
And many people are like that.

482
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,356
Women for sure.
They're like a union.

483
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,109
Yo, cab!

484
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:15,788
Okay, pull over to the curb over there.
Right over to the curb. Over there.

485
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,875
No, no, don't... Don't... Don't...

486
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,461
The fucking meter.
What are you doing?

487
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,838
What are you doing with the meter?

488
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:28,217
Did I tell you to put...?
Did I tell you to do that with the meter?

489
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,469
Put the meter back.
Let the numbers go on.

490
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,346
I don't care what I have to pay.

491
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:36,183
I'm not getting out.
Put the meter back on.

492
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,392
Put it down.

493
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,772
Put it... That's right.
Put it... Put it down!

494
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,900
That's right.

495
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,278
Why are you writing?
Don't write!

496
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,988
Put the thing down. Just sit.

497
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,578
I didn't tell you to write.
I just said, "Pull over."

498
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,289
We pulled over to the curb.
We're gonna sit here.

499
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,876
We're gonna sit.

500
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:25,566
Cabbie, you see that light up there?
The window?

501
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,403
The light?
The window in the second floor.

502
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,993
The one that's closest
to the edge of the building.

503
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,581
The light up in the window.
Second story.

504
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,959
What are you, blind?

505
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,794
Do you see the light?

506
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,548
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you see it. Good.

507
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:52,843
You see the woman?

508
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,182
Do you see the woman in the window?

509
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,353
- Yeah.
- You see the woman. Good.

510
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,440
I want you to see that woman
because that's my wife.

511
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,819
But that's not my apartment.

512
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:16,450
It's not my apartment.
You know who lives there, huh?

513
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:21,038
No, I mean, you wouldn't know.
But you know who lives there?

514
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,957
A nigger lives there.

515
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,043
How do you like that?

516
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,219
And I'm g... I'm gonna kill her.

517
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:40,307
There's nothing else.
I'm gonna kill her.

518
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,517
Well, what do you think of that?

519
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,480
I said, what do you think of that?

520
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,398
Don't answer.

521
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,859
You don't have to answer everything.

522
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,783
I'm gonna kill her
with a.44 Magnum pistol.

523
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,537
I have a.44 Magnum pistol.
I'm gonna kill her with that gun.

524
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,541
Did you ever see what a.44 Magnum
pistol can do to a woman's face?

525
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:10,671
I mean, it'd fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.

526
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,173
That's what it can do to her face.

527
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,635
Did you ever see what it can do to
a woman's pussy? You should.

528
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:21,723
You should see what a.44 Magnum's
gonna do to a woman's pussy.

529
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,023
What's that?

530
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:33,193
I know you must think
that I'm, you know...

531
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:37,155
You must think
I'm pretty sick or something.

532
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,534
Right? You must think
I'm pretty sick?

533
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:48,208
Right? I bet you really
think I'm sick, right?

534
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,758
You think I'm sick?

535
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:03,473
You don't have to answer.
I'm paying for the ride.

536
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,394
I picked up this midget, you know.

537
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,147
He's very well-dressed,
Italian suit...

538
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,816
...good-looking,
with a beautiful tall blonde.

539
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,569
- Was it a lady midget?
- No, the guy was a midget.

540
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,071
- The blonde was a lady.
- I got you.

541
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,324
Those midgets are funny.

542
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,660
Sometimes I like to hold a midget.

543
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,663
They're funny. They always
wanna sit in the front seat.

544
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:32,169
Then I pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.

545
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:38,508
They're wearing rhinestone T-shirts.
They start arguing and yelling.

546
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,720
The other one says, "You bitch,"
and starts beating him.

547
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,431
I say, "I don't care
what you do in the privacy...

548
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,017
...of your own home,
behind closed doors.

549
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,935
This is an American free country.

550
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:53,732
We got a pursuit of happiness thing.
You're consenting, you're adult.

551
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:58,528
But, you know, in my fucking cab,
don't go busting heads.

552
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,948
- God loves you, do what you want."
- Tell them to go to California.

553
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:06,828
In California, when two fags split up,
one's gotta pay the other one alimony.

554
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:13,043
Not bad. They're way ahead
out there, you know? California.

555
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,170
So I tell them to get out of the cab.

556
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,006
One time, I saw a cop chase
this guy with one leg.

557
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,343
- He was on crutches, you know.
- The cop?

558
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,846
No, the dude he was chasing.
Fucking cops, they chase anything.

559
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:28,517
- Hey, Travis.
- Hey, you got that 5 you owe me?

560
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:33,939
My man is loaded. Loaded.

561
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:38,819
I'd be broke if I hadn't caught me
some people from Ohio out at Kennedy.

562
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:43,156
I took them into Manhattan by way
of Long Beach, tipped me $5.

563
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,409
What's the action around?

564
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,202
It's pretty slow.

565
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,788
I'm shoving on.

566
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,332
Hey, Wiz, wait.

567
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:56,586
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Bye, Killer.

568
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,716
Thank you. Night.

569
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,109
- You put it down.
- You can have them all you want!

570
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,695
Hey, don't be hitting my man!

571
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,991
You better take your ass out, boy!

572
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,955
Yeah?

573
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,624
I know you and I ain't talked
too much, you know.

574
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,711
But I figure you've been around a lot,
so you could...

575
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,422
Shoot, that's why
they call me the Wizard.

576
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,923
I got...

577
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:46,636
It's just that I got a... I got a...

578
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,096
Things got you down?

579
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,349
Yeah, happens to the best of them.

580
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,061
Yeah, they got me real down.
Real...

581
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,152
I just wanna go out...

582
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:06,531
...and you know, like, really...
Really... Really do something.

583
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,494
Taxi life, you mean?

584
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:14,039
Yeah, well...

585
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,124
No, it's...

586
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,627
I don't know.

587
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,006
I just wanna go out...

588
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,675
I really...

589
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:28,261
I really wanna...

590
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:31,556
I got some bad ideas in my head.
I just...

591
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,810
Look. Look at it this way.

592
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:40,941
A man...
A man takes a job, you know.

593
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,068
And that job...

594
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,614
...you know, that becomes what he is.

595
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,699
You know, like...

596
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,870
You do a thing,
and that's what you are.

597
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,917
I've been a cabbie for 17 years.
Ten years at night.

598
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,003
And I still don't own my own cab,
you know. Why?

599
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:06,967
Because I don't want to.
That must be what I want.

600
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:10,345
You know, to be on the night shift,
driving somebody else's cab.

601
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,222
You understand?

602
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,226
You get a job, you become the job.

603
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,980
One guy lives in Brooklyn,
one guy lives in Sutton Place.

604
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,691
You get a lawyer,
another guy's a doctor.

605
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:26,027
Another guy dies,
another guy gets well...

606
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,029
...and people are born.

607
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,365
I envy you, your youth.

608
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:34,995
Go out and get laid.
Get drunk. You know, do anything.

609
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,625
You got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're all fucked.

610
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,546
More or less, you know?

611
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:52,470
I don't know. That's about
the dumbest thing I ever heard.

612
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:57,309
It's not Bertrand Russell,
but what do you want? I'm a cabbie.

613
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,768
What do I know?

614
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,855
I don't even know what the fuck
you're talking about.

615
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,357
Maybe I don't know either.

616
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:10,238
Don't worry so much. Relax,
Killer, you're gonna be all right.

617
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,366
I know.
I've seen a lot of people...

618
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,745
...and I know.
- Okay.

619
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,330
Okay. Thanks, man.

620
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,875
I'll see you. I guess...

621
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:27,297
Yeah, you know. You're all right.
You're all right.

622
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:49,778
What do you think of your opponent's
chances in the upcoming primary?

623
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,571
Mr. Goodman is a fine man.

624
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:55,116
I would certainly,
if it came to it, prefer him...

625
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,911
...to our opponent
in the other party.

626
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,748
I think that my programs
are better defined than his.

627
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,669
They're more imaginative.
I have a better chance of winning.

628
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,713
It's academic, though. He's not
gonna win the primary. I am.

629
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,674
I see.

630
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,260
Well, one more thing
I'd like to ask you.

631
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,721
How do you feel
your campaign is going?

632
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,100
When we came up with our slogan
"We are the people"...

633
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,602
...when I said
"Let the people rule"...

634
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,689
...I felt I was being
somewhat overly optimistic.

635
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,484
I must tell you that I am more
optimistic now than ever before.

636
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:33,613
The people are rising to the demands
that I have made on them.

637
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:36,282
The people are beginning to rule.

638
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:39,119
I feel it is a groundswell.
I know...

639
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:42,288
...it will continue
through the primary and in Miami.

640
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,250
And I know it will rise...

641
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,169
...to an unprecedented swell
in November.

642
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,674
That bitch, goddamn!
I'll blow her brains out!

643
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:21,054
I'll kill her, goddamn it! I'm gonna
get my hands on her, I'll kill her!

644
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,555
Shoot, goddamn it! Fucker!

645
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:26,476
I swear if I get my hands on her,
I'll kill that fucking bitch!

646
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,771
- Hey, Sport.
- Hey, Sport.

647
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:32,148
I'll kill her! Damn it!

648
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:35,401
- That guy keeps following us.
- Don't look at him.

649
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:53,127
Hey, guys.

650
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:58,633
- You wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

651
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:14,315
Loneliness has followed me
my whole life, everywhere.

652
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,110
In bars, in cars...

653
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:19,988
...sidewalks, stores, everywhere.

654
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:22,532
There's no escape.

655
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,451
I'm God's lonely man.

656
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,124
June 8th.

657
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,043
My life has taken another turn again.

658
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:37,755
The days move along
with regularity, over and over...

659
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,508
...one day indistinguishable
from the next.

660
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,219
A long, continuous chain.

661
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,263
And then suddenly...

662
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,557
...there is change.

663
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:05,074
Travis, this here's Easy Andy.
He's a traveling salesman.

664
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:07,368
How you doing, Travis?

665
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:32,810
- You got a.44 Magnum?
- It's an expensive weapon.

666
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,063
That's all right. I got money.

667
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,981
It's a real monster.

668
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,778
Stop a car at 100 yards, put a round
right through the engine block.

669
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,499
Here you go.

670
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:57,543
It's a premium, high-resale weapon.

671
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,257
Look at that.

672
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,594
Look at that. That's a beauty.

673
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:14,811
I could sell this gun to some
jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.

674
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:19,107
But I just deal high-quality goods
to the right people.

675
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,609
How about that?

676
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:24,988
This might be a little too big
for practical purposes.

677
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,448
In which case,
for you, I'd recommend...

678
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,659
...38 snub-nosed.

679
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,079
Look at this.

680
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,750
Look at that.
That's a beautiful little gun.

681
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,169
It's nickel-plated with a snub-nose...

682
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,797
...otherwise the same
as a service revolver.

683
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,258
That'll stop anything that moves.

684
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:48,845
The Magnum, they use that
in Africa for killing elephants.

685
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:52,265
That.38, that's a funny gun.

686
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,605
Some of these guns are like toys.

687
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:02,942
That.38, you go out and
hammer nails with it all day...

688
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:06,446
...come back and it'll cut
dead center on target every time.

689
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:10,616
It's got a really nice action to it
and a heck of a wallop.

690
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,038
You interested in an automatic?

691
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:19,375
It's a Colt.25 automatic.
It's a nice little gun.

692
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:20,793
It's a beautiful gun.

693
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:23,588
Holds six shots in the clip,
one shot in the chamber.

694
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,882
If you're dumb enough
to put a round there.

695
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,802
Here. Look at this.

696
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,512
.380 Walther.

697
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,973
Holds eight shots in the clip.

698
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:37,101
That's a nice gun.

699
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,812
That's a beautiful little gun.
Look at that.

700
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,528
During World War II, they used
this gun to replace the P 38.

701
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,573
Just given out to officers.

702
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,372
Ain't that a little honey?

703
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,134
- How much for everything?
- All together?

704
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:14,430
Well, only a jackass would carry
that cannon in the streets like that.

705
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:19,018
Here's a beautiful handmade holster
I had made in Mexico.

706
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,104
Forty dollars.

707
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,857
Three-fifty for the Magnum,
250 for the.38...

708
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:28,653
...one and a quarter for the.25,
150 for the.380.

709
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:32,073
You take this and wait here.
I'll walk down with you.

710
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,952
How about dope? Grass?
Hash? Coke?

711
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:40,123
Mescaline? Downers? Nembutal?
Tuinal? Chloral hydrates?

712
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:43,876
- How about uppers, amphetamines?
- No, I'm not interested in that stuff.

713
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:46,754
I can get you crystal meth,
nitrous oxide.

714
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,382
How about a Cadillac?
A brand-new Cadillac...

715
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,425
...with the pink slip, two grand.

716
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,561
June 29th.

717
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:05,523
I gotta get in shape now.
Too much sitting has ruined my body.

718
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:08,276
Too much abuse has gone on
for too long.

719
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:10,945
From now on, it'll be
50 pushups each morning.

720
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:14,282
Fifty pull-ups.
There will be no more pills.

721
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:18,661
There will be no more bad food,
no more destroyers of my body.

722
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:22,957
From now on, it'll be total organization.
Every muscle must be tight.

723
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:45,062
Look at the size of that.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

724
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,440
Oh, it looks so good.

725
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:57,241
It's getting harder and harder,
and it's throbbing now.

726
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:02,788
The idea had been growing
in my brain for some time.

727
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,124
True force.

728
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:09,962
All the king's men cannot
put it back together again.

729
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,420
- Where do we get more of these?
- Where do you think? At headquarters.

730
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,797
All the way back there?

731
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,215
- Come on.
- They'll work.

732
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:21,135
- Maybe it's the speakers.
- I've done this 100 times.

733
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,637
- You've done this before?
- Yes, don't worry.

734
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,766
- When was the last time?
- I've never done this before.

735
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:28,476
Betsy!

736
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,895
- Betsy!
- What?!

737
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,648
Betsy. Come here, come here.

738
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,538
Hey.

739
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,334
Hey, you're a Secret Service man,
aren't you?

740
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:39,505
Just waiting for the senator.

741
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,675
You're waiting for the senator?

742
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:48,722
That's a very good answer.

743
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:51,183
Shit, man.

744
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:55,771
I'm waiting for the sun to shine.
Yeah.

745
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:59,942
No, the reason I asked
if you were a Secret Service man...

746
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,735
I won't say anything.

747
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:03,487
- Is because I...

748
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,785
I saw some suspicious-looking
people over there.

749
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,204
- You did?
- They were right over there.

750
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,962
They were just here.

751
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,468
They were very, very...

752
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:28,053
- Suspicious.
- Yeah.

753
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:33,058
Where'd he go?

754
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,061
Is it hard to get to be in
the Secret Service?

755
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,313
Why?

756
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:40,441
Well, I was just curious,
because I think I'd be good at it.

757
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,485
I'm very observant.

758
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:45,404
I was in the Marine Corps, you know.

759
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,740
I'm good with crowds.

760
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:53,579
I noticed your little pin there.
That's like a signal, isn't it?

761
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,872
Sort of.

762
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:59,168
A signal. A secret signal
for a Secret Service.

763
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,590
Hey, what kind of guns
you guys carry?

764
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:09,845
.38s? .45s? .357 Magnums?
Something bigger, maybe?

765
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:14,808
Look, if you're really interested, if
you give me your name and address...

766
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,562
...we'll send you all the information
on how to apply. How's that?

767
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:22,233
- You will?
- Sure.

768
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,943
Okay.

769
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,861
Why not?

770
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,283
My name is Henry...

771
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,663
...Krinkle. K-R-I-N-K-L-E.

772
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,962
154 Hopper Avenue.

773
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,297
- "Hopper"?
- Yeah.

774
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:50,302
You know, like a rabbit? Hip, hop.

775
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,307
Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

776
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,144
Is there a zip code?

777
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:02,356
Yeah, 6-1-0-4-5-2.

778
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:08,362
- Okay?
- That's six digits. 6, 1...

779
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:12,533
Oh, well, 6-1-0-4-5.

780
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,827
Okay.

781
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,122
I was thinking of
my telephone number.

782
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:19,456
Well, I've got it all.

783
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,418
Henry, we'll get all the stuff
right out to you.

784
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:26,130
Thanks a lot. Hey, great.
Thanks a lot. Hell. Jesus.

785
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,173
- Be careful today.
- Right. Will do.

786
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:32,595
You have to be careful around
a place like this. Bye.

787
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,229
Damn it!

788
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,003
Yeah.

789
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:13,260
I'm faster than you,
you fucking sick...

790
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,180
I saw you coming, you fuck.

791
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,057
Shitheel!

792
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:24,396
I'm standing here.
You make the move.

793
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:26,273
You make the move.

794
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,400
It's your move.

795
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,656
Don't try it, you fuck.

796
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:49,922
You talking to me?

797
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:55,552
Well, then who the hell else are you
talking to? You talking to me?

798
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:58,055
Well, I'm the only one here.

799
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:03,268
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

800
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,145
Oh, yeah?

801
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,941
Okay.

802
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,617
Listen, you fuckers,
you screwheads.

803
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:21,370
Here is a man who would not
take it anymore.

804
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:23,747
Who would not let...

805
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,834
Listen, you fuckers,
you screwheads.

806
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:30,504
Here is a man who would not
take it anymore.

807
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,798
A man who stood up
against the scum...

808
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:35,384
...the cunts, the dogs,
the filth, the shit.

809
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:38,637
Here is someone who stood up.

810
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,979
You're dead.

811
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,215
Hey, Travis.

812
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,092
Hi, Melio.

813
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,438
Yeah, man?

814
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:33,776
Okay, shut your fucking mouth and give
me the cash out the drawer. Come on!

815
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:36,820
- Let's go. Give me the damn cash.
- Don't shoot.

816
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,239
Stop taking so long. Come on!

817
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,909
Let me have it. Give me the bread.

818
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,702
- This all you got?
- That's it.

819
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,205
I don't have any more money, man.

820
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:48,207
- That's all I got!
- You got more.

821
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,460
- I tell you, I got no money!
- Reach in your sock.

822
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,629
- Give me the rest of the bread.
- Hey. Hey.

823
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:01,595
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, I got him.

824
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,560
Shit, man.

825
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:13,315
- Is he dead?
- I don't know. His eyes are moving.

826
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:22,825
I ain't got a permit for this thing.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

827
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,331
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

828
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:32,417
- Can I give you some money?
- No, man, just get out of here.

829
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:35,170
No, man. I'll take care of it.
Go ahead.

830
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:41,844
The fifth motherfucker this year!

831
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:30,118
Walt Whitman, that great
American poet...

832
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,371
...spoke for all of us when he said:

833
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:35,374
"I am the man. I suffered.

834
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:38,752
I was there."
Today I say to you:

835
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:42,381
We are the people. We suffered.

836
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,883
We were there.

837
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,389
We, the people,
suffered in Vietnam.

838
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:53,725
We, the people, suffered.
We still suffer...

839
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:56,728
...from unemployment, inflation...

840
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,981
...crime and corruption.

841
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:04,194
Dear Father and Mother...

842
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:06,738
...July is the month I remember...

843
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:10,158
...which brings not only
your wedding anniversary...

844
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:13,578
...but also Father's Day
and Mother's birthday.

845
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:16,707
I'm sorry I can't remember
the exact dates...

846
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:20,919
...but I hope this card
will take care of them all.

847
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:24,339
I'm sorry, again, I cannot
send you my address...

848
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:27,009
...like I promised to last year.

849
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:30,012
But the sensitive nature of my work
for the government...

850
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,431
...demands utmost secrecy.

851
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:35,767
I know you will understand.

852
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:39,104
I am healthy and well
and making lots of money.

853
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,606
I've been going with a girl
for several months...

854
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,443
...and I know you'd be proud
if you could see her.

855
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:48,780
Her name is Betsy, but I can tell
you no more than that.

856
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:51,324
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.

857
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:56,413
Come on! Come on, let's go!
Let's go! Move it!

858
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:02,252
- Bear the burden of suffering
for the few.

859
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:05,797
No more will we fight the wars
of the few...

860
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:08,300
...through the heart of the many.

861
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:16,224
I hope this card finds you
all well, as it does me.

862
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:19,811
I hope no one has died.
Don't worry about me.

863
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:23,440
One day there will be a knock
on the door and it'll be me.

864
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,234
Love, Travis.

865
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,659
Don't you have some idea?

866
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,661
I'm not the one who
wants to talk.

867
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:40,916
But you must know that the reason
that I didn't marry him...

868
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:45,003
...is because I couldn't stand
to be a cause of divorce.

869
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:51,134
Now he's getting a divorce anyway.

870
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:57,307
Phillip wants to marry me, Brock.

871
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,687
I do love him.

872
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,360
What about us, June?

873
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:11,696
Our marriage?

874
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:16,493
You gotta know
our marriage wasn't legal.

875
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,830
In the eyes of God, we are married.

876
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:26,336
Brock, please don't do this to me.

877
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:29,840
I love him so...

878
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,684
Damn.

879
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,229
Goddamn!

880
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:20,765
They trying to get in the picture.

881
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:27,606
- You looking for some action?
- Yeah.

882
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:34,237
- You see that guy over there?
- Yeah.

883
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:36,573
You go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.

884
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:40,285
- I'll be over there waiting for you.
- Okay.

885
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,209
Your name Matthew?
I want some action.

886
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,127
Officer.

887
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:54,299
I swear I'm clean.
I'm just waiting here for a friend.

888
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,801
You gonna bust me
for nothing, man?

889
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,387
I'm not a cop. I ain't a...

890
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,806
Then why are you
asking me for action?

891
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,394
Because she sent me over.

892
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:11,441
I suppose that ain't a.38
you've got in your sock.

893
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:13,276
A.38?

894
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,739
I'm clean, man.

895
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,659
- Shit, you're a real cowboy?
- Yeah.

896
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:24,329
That's nice, man. All right.
That's all right.

897
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:28,291
Fifteen dollars, 15 minutes.
Twenty-five dollars, half an hour.

898
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:31,419
Shit.

899
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:33,046
A cowboy, huh?

900
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:37,008
I once had a horse.
In Coney Island.

901
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,927
She got hit by a car.

902
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:43,306
Well, take it or leave it.

903
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:46,643
If you wanna save yourself
some money, don't fuck her.

904
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:48,645
Because you'll be back for more.

905
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:52,691
She's 12 and a half years old.
You ain't never had no pussy like that.

906
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,610
Do anything you want.
Come on her...

907
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,697
...fuck her in the mouth, in the ass.
Come on her face.

908
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:02,284
She'll get your cock so hard,
she'll make it explode.

909
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:07,706
But no rough stuff. All right?

910
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,379
All right, I'll take it.

911
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:18,216
Hey, man! Don't take out no money
over here.

912
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:19,634
You wanna fuck me?

913
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,887
You're gonna fuck her,
you give her the money.

914
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:25,890
Catch you later, copper.

915
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,394
- What'd you say?
- I'll see you later, copper.

916
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:32,897
I'm no cop, man.

917
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,527
Well, if you are,
it's entrapment already.

918
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,865
I'm hip.

919
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:45,243
Funny, you don't look hip.

920
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:51,708
Go ahead. Have yourself a good time.
Go ahead, man.

921
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,552
You're a funny guy.

922
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,766
But looks aren't everything.

923
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,060
Go ahead, man. Have a good time.

924
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:17,275
You're a funny guy.

925
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:58,983
Hey.

926
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:01,444
The room'll cost you 10 bucks.

927
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,334
I'm timing you too.

928
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:36,938
Come on.

929
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,116
Are you really 12 and a half?

930
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:54,247
Listen, mister, it's your time.
Fifteen minutes ain't long.

931
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,669
When that cigarette burns out,
your time is up.

932
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,300
How old are you?

933
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:09,053
You won't tell me?

934
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:12,557
- What's your name?
- Easy.

935
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,685
- That's not any kind of name.
- It's easy to remember.

936
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:18,354
Yeah, but what's your real name?

937
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:20,064
I don't like my real name.

938
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:22,400
But what's your real name?

939
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:27,655
Iris.

940
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,158
What's wrong with that?
It's a nice name.

941
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,452
That's what you think.

942
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:42,754
No, don't do that. Don't do that.
Don't you remember me?

943
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:47,091
Remember when you got into
a taxi? It was a checkered taxi.

944
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,427
You got in and that guy
Matthew came by...

945
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:52,096
...and he said he wanted to
take you away.

946
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:53,431
He pulled you away.

947
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:56,809
I don't remember that.

948
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:01,272
- You don't remember any of that?
- No.

949
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:04,150
I'm gonna get you out of here.

950
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,653
Listen, we better make it
or Sport'll get mad.

951
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:09,948
- How do you wanna make it?
- I don't wanna make it. Who's Sport?

952
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:12,951
That's Matthew. I call him Sport.

953
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:19,999
Wanna make it like this?

954
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:27,298
Listen, I...

955
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:28,967
Can't you understand something?

956
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:32,804
You're the one that came into my cab.
You wanted to get out of here.

957
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,472
Well, I must've been stoned.

958
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:38,309
- Why? They drug you?
- Oh, come off it, man.

959
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,938
What are you doing?

960
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:44,148
Don't you wanna make it?

961
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:49,487
No, I don't wanna make it.
I wanna help you.

962
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:52,323
Well, I could help you.

963
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:58,204
Damn, man!

964
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:00,498
Goddamn it!

965
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:07,672
Shit, man. What the hell's
the matter with you?

966
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:10,341
We don't have to make it, mister.

967
01:22:10,551 --> 01:22:12,594
Damn it!
Don't you wanna get out of here?

968
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:18,016
Can't you understand why I'm here?

969
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,518
I think I understand.

970
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:24,022
I tried to get into your cab...

971
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,733
...and now you wanna
come and take me away.

972
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,571
- Is that it?
- Yeah, but don't you wanna go?

973
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:35,700
- I can leave any time I want to.
- Then what about that one night?

974
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,871
Look, I was stoned.

975
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:44,500
That's why they stopped me.

976
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:49,213
When I'm not stoned I got
no place else to go.

977
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,425
So they just...

978
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,136
...protect me from myself.

979
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:04,062
I don't know.

980
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:08,900
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

981
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:12,111
Hey, look, I understand.

982
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:17,408
- And it means something, really.
- Yeah, well.

983
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:19,744
Well, look, can I see you again?

984
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:22,413
- That's not hard to do.
- I don't mean like that.

985
01:23:22,623 --> 01:23:26,417
I mean, you know, regularly.
This is nothing for a person to do.

986
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:28,586
How about breakfast tomorrow?

987
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:30,797
- Tomorrow?
- I get up at 1:00.

988
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:33,424
- One o'clock?
- One o'clock.

989
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:38,096
Well, I got a thing. I don't know...

990
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:39,597
Do you want to or not?

991
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:41,808
Yeah, I want...
Okay, all right.

992
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:43,559
- Okay, 1:00.
- One o'clock.

993
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:46,437
Okay. See you tomorrow.

994
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:50,608
Oh, Iris. My name is Travis.

995
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:53,945
Thanks a lot, Travis.

996
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:58,950
So long, Iris.
See you tomorrow.

997
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,286
Sweet Iris.

998
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:28,146
This is yours.

999
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:29,981
Spend it right.

1000
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:37,196
Come back anytime, cowboy.

1001
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,240
I will.

1002
01:24:57,843 --> 01:25:00,678
Why do you want me
to go back to my parents?

1003
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,388
They hate me.

1004
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:05,892
Why do you think I split?
There ain't nothing there.

1005
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:09,645
Yeah, but you can't live like this.
It's a hell.

1006
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:11,689
A girl should live at home.

1007
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,358
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?

1008
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:16,360
What do you mean, "women's lib"?

1009
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:19,405
You're a young girl.
You should be at home now.

1010
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,741
You should be dressed up,
going out with boys.

1011
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,534
You should be going to school.

1012
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:27,455
- You know, that kind of stuff.
- Oh, God, are you square.

1013
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:29,707
Hey, I'm not square. You're square.

1014
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,751
You're full of shit, man.

1015
01:25:31,919 --> 01:25:34,212
What are you talking about?
You walk out with...

1016
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:36,756
...fucking creeps,
lowlifes and degenerates...

1017
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:40,426
...and you sell your little
pussy for nothing, man?

1018
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,553
For some lowlife pimp?

1019
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:44,889
Stands in a hall.

1020
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:49,101
I'm the...? I'm square?
You're the one that's square, man.

1021
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:52,730
I don't go screw and fuck with
killers and junkies the way you do.

1022
01:25:53,774 --> 01:25:55,733
You call that being hip?

1023
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:58,402
What world you from?

1024
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:06,410
- Who's a killer?
- That guy Sport's a killer.

1025
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,079
Sport never killed nobody.

1026
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:09,747
- He killed...
- He's a Libra.

1027
01:26:09,957 --> 01:26:11,123
He's a what?

1028
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:14,710
I'm a Libra too.
That's why we get along so well.

1029
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:19,757
He looks like a killer to me.

1030
01:26:19,967 --> 01:26:23,636
I think that Cancers
make the best lovers...

1031
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,097
...but my whole family
are air signs.

1032
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:27,473
He's also a dope-shooter.

1033
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:31,644
What makes you so high and mighty?
Will you tell me that?

1034
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:35,022
Did you ever try looking at
your own eyeballs in the mirror?

1035
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,447
What'll you do about
Sport and that old bastard?

1036
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:45,783
- When?
- When you leave.

1037
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:50,621
I'll just leave them.

1038
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:52,665
- Just leave?
- They got other girls.

1039
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:55,793
You just can't do that.
What are you gonna do?

1040
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:00,131
Want me to call the cops?

1041
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,842
The cops don't do nothing.
You know that.

1042
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:07,179
Look, Sport never treated me bad.
He didn't beat me up once.

1043
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:10,808
But you can't allow him to do
the same to other girls.

1044
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:12,560
You can't allow him to do that.

1045
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:14,979
He is the lowest kind of person.

1046
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:17,148
Somebody's got to do
something to him.

1047
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:18,816
He's the scum of the earth.

1048
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,568
He's the worst...

1049
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:24,363
...sucking scum
I have ever, ever seen.

1050
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,535
You know what he told me about you?

1051
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:35,583
He called you names. He called
you a little piece of chicken.

1052
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:40,171
He does... He...
He doesn't mean it.

1053
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:45,843
I'll move up to one of them
communes in Vermont.

1054
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:53,184
I never seen a commune before,
but I don't know.

1055
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,519
I saw...

1056
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:58,940
...some photos once in a magazine.
It didn't look very clean.

1057
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,442
Why don't you come with me?

1058
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:05,237
What? Come to the commune
with you? No, no.

1059
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:06,864
Why not?

1060
01:28:08,742 --> 01:28:12,620
- I don't go to places like that.
- Oh, come on, why not?

1061
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:14,872
I don't get along with
people like that.

1062
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:17,249
- Are you a Scorpion?
- What?

1063
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:20,878
That's it. You're a Scorpion.
I can tell every time.

1064
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:24,048
Besides, I gotta stay here.

1065
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:27,051
- Come on. Why?
- I got something very important to do.

1066
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:28,844
So, what's so important?

1067
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,932
I'm doing something
for the government.

1068
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:36,060
The cab thing is just part-time.

1069
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:38,729
Are you a narc?

1070
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,358
Do I look like a narc?

1071
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:44,902
Yeah.

1072
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:47,363
I am a narc.

1073
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:51,909
God! I don't know who's
weirder, you or me.

1074
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:02,253
- Sure you don't wanna come with me?
- I'll give you the money to go.

1075
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:05,464
- You don't have to do that.
- I want you to take it.

1076
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:08,467
I don't want you to take
anything from them.

1077
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:10,511
And I wanna do it.

1078
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:13,264
I don't have anything better
to do with my money.

1079
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:17,435
I might be going away
for a while.

1080
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:46,464
You're just a little tense,
that's all.

1081
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:49,175
I don't like what I'm doing, Sport.

1082
01:29:49,468 --> 01:29:52,428
Baby, I never wanted you
to like what you're doing.

1083
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:56,557
If you ever liked what you were doing,
you wouldn't be my woman.

1084
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,811
You never spend any time
with me anymore.

1085
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:04,065
Well, I got to attend
to business, baby.

1086
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:07,651
You miss your man, don't you?

1087
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:12,364
I don't like to be away
from you either.

1088
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:15,159
You know how I feel about you.

1089
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:18,245
I depend on you.

1090
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:21,832
I'd be lost without you.

1091
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:25,753
Don't you ever forget that.

1092
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,473
How much I need you.

1093
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:41,393
Come to me, baby.

1094
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:53,280
Let me hold you.

1095
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:04,125
When you're close to me like this,
I feel so good.

1096
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:13,300
I only wish every man could know
what it's like to be loved by you.

1097
01:31:18,265 --> 01:31:21,225
That every woman, everywhere...

1098
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:26,063
...had a man who loves her
like I love you.

1099
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:33,320
God, it's good so close.

1100
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:47,293
You know, at times like this...

1101
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:50,629
...I know I'm a lucky man.

1102
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:56,677
Touching a woman who
wants me and needs me.

1103
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:06,103
It's only you that keeps me together.

1104
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:41,031
Now I see it clearly.
My whole life has pointed...

1105
01:33:41,241 --> 01:33:43,534
...in one direction. I see that now.

1106
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:48,247
There never has been
any choice for me.

1107
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:24,408
Ladies and gentlemen...

1108
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:28,912
...the next president of the United
States, Senator Charles Palantine.

1109
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:36,628
Thank you, Tom.

1110
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:39,089
Ladies and gentlemen...

1111
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:44,428
...we are met today at a crossroads,
Columbus Circle.

1112
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:46,764
This is no ordinary place.

1113
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:51,769
It is a place where many roads
and many lives intersect.

1114
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:55,606
It is appropriate that
we meet here today...

1115
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:59,151
...because these
are not ordinary times.

1116
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:02,446
We meet at a crossroads in history.

1117
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:07,785
For far too long, the wrong roads
have been taken.

1118
01:35:08,078 --> 01:35:12,289
The wrong roads have led us
into war, into poverty...

1119
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:15,417
...into unemployment and inflation.

1120
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:19,963
Today I say to you,
we have reached the turning point.

1121
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,971
No longer will we, the people,
suffer for the few.

1122
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:40,442
Now, I would lie to you if I told you
the new roads would be easy.

1123
01:35:41,111 --> 01:35:43,153
They will not be easy.

1124
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:46,949
Nothing that is right and good
has ever been easy.

1125
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:49,159
We, the people, know that.

1126
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:57,418
And we, the people,
know the right roads and the good.

1127
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:02,714
Today I say to you,
we are the people, you and I.

1128
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:06,218
And it is time to let the people rule!

1129
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:07,678
Thank you.

1130
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:26,196
All right, let him through. Pull back.

1131
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:33,078
Palantine.

1132
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:42,546
Thank you. Thank you.

1133
01:36:47,469 --> 01:36:48,844
Over there. Get that man.

1134
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:52,764
Give him some air!

1135
01:36:53,475 --> 01:36:55,392
Give him some air, will you?

1136
01:36:55,685 --> 01:36:57,561
- I never saw him.
- I saw him run.

1137
01:36:57,854 --> 01:36:59,730
- I saw him.
- Where was he?

1138
01:37:26,382 --> 01:37:27,549
What's happening?

1139
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:29,092
Got the money?

1140
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:41,438
- Iris in her room?
- Yeah.

1141
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:43,106
Okay.

1142
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:20,811
Hey, Sport, how you doing?

1143
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:23,105
Okay, okay, my man. How...?

1144
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:27,484
- Where do I know you from, man?
- I don't know.

1145
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:29,987
How's everything
in the pimp business?

1146
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:33,323
- Do I know you?
- No.

1147
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:34,992
Do I know you?

1148
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:37,119
Get out of here.
Come on, get lost.

1149
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:38,954
Do I know you?

1150
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:42,666
How's Iris?

1151
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:44,334
You know Iris.

1152
01:38:44,586 --> 01:38:47,296
No, I don't know nobody named Iris.

1153
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:49,590
Iris? Come on, get out of here, man.

1154
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:54,803
- You don't know anybody named Iris?
- I don't know nobody named Iris.

1155
01:38:55,305 --> 01:38:56,513
No?

1156
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:59,391
Get back to your fucking tribe
before you get hurt.

1157
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:02,102
I don't want no trouble, okay?

1158
01:39:03,605 --> 01:39:05,022
You got a gun?

1159
01:39:06,232 --> 01:39:09,359
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get out of here.

1160
01:39:09,861 --> 01:39:11,486
Suck on this.

1161
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:47,564
Hey!

1162
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,771
You crazy son of a bitch!

1163
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:29,439
Fucking son of a bitch!

1164
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:34,319
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1165
01:40:34,487 --> 01:40:37,489
I'll kill you!
I'll fucking kill you!

1166
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,825
Crazy son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

1167
01:40:57,468 --> 01:40:58,802
Crazy son of a bitch!

1168
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:02,431
You fucking bastard! I'll kill you!

1169
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:05,767
You crazy son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

1170
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:09,980
I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1171
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:14,651
Stop!

1172
01:41:27,457 --> 01:41:28,540
Don't shoot him!

1173
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:09,612
Dear Mr. Bickle:

1174
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:13,783
I can't say how happy
Mrs. Steensma and I were...

1175
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:16,953
...to hear that you are
well and recuperating.

1176
01:46:17,163 --> 01:46:20,040
We tried to visit you at the hospital...

1177
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:22,959
...when we were in New York
to pick up Iris...

1178
01:46:23,252 --> 01:46:25,795
...but you were still in a coma.

1179
01:46:26,088 --> 01:46:28,131
There is no way we can repay you...

1180
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:31,468
...for returning our Iris to us.

1181
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:33,428
We thought we had lost her...

1182
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:36,806
...and now our lives are full again.

1183
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:38,641
Needless to say...

1184
01:46:38,851 --> 01:46:43,354
...you are something
of a hero around this household.

1185
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:47,609
I'm sure you want to know about Iris.

1186
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:51,321
She's back in school and working hard.

1187
01:46:51,614 --> 01:46:54,657
The transition has been
very hard for her...

1188
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:56,159
...as you can well imagine.

1189
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:59,204
But we have taken steps to see...

1190
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:03,625
...she has never cause
to run away again.

1191
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:05,627
In conclusion...

1192
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:09,589
...Mrs. Steensma and I
would like to again thank you...

1193
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:12,509
...from the bottom of our hearts.

1194
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:16,805
Unfortunately, we cannot afford
to come to New York again...

1195
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:20,975
...to thank you in person,
or we surely would.

1196
01:47:21,185 --> 01:47:24,020
But if you should ever
come to Pittsburgh...

1197
01:47:24,313 --> 01:47:28,858
...you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home.

1198
01:47:29,151 --> 01:47:34,030
Our deepest thanks,
Burt and Ivy Steensma.

1199
01:47:35,241 --> 01:47:39,536
Eddie, the owner-operator, comes up,
he says, "Hey, I wanna swap tires."

1200
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:41,329
I say, "These are new tires.

1201
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:44,707
Why not throw in something else,
like your wife?"

1202
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:49,003
- His wife was Miss New Jersey of 1957.
- That's why the fleet has no spares.

1203
01:47:49,213 --> 01:47:51,631
- Doughboy, Wizard, Killer.
- Hey.

1204
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:54,259
- Charlie T.
- What's happening?

1205
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,761
Hey, Travis, you got a fare.

1206
01:47:58,264 --> 01:47:59,556
Shit.

1207
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:01,766
Well, see you later.

1208
01:48:02,059 --> 01:48:03,685
See you, Travis.

1209
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,583
Hello, Travis.

1210
01:48:28,043 --> 01:48:29,252
Hello.

1211
01:48:50,191 --> 01:48:52,901
I hear Palantine got the nomination.

1212
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:57,280
Yeah, won't be long now.
Seventeen days.

1213
01:48:58,324 --> 01:49:00,200
Well, I hope he wins.

1214
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:16,925
I read about you in the papers.
How are you?

1215
01:49:19,762 --> 01:49:22,472
Oh, it was nothing, really.
I got over that.

1216
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:27,477
The papers always
blow these things up.

1217
01:49:29,313 --> 01:49:32,607
Just a little stiffness. That's all.

1218
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:10,853
Travis.

1219
01:50:16,568 --> 01:50:18,278
How much was it?

1220
01:50:27,413 --> 01:50:28,788
So long.
