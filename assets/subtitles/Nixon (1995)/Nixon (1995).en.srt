1
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,680
I just don't understand it, Bob.
I've logged a lot of miles.

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,480
I've followed
the sales textbook by the letter.

3
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,600
I've applied myself diligently.

4
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,570
I mean, I try and I try,
and I just cannot get in the door.

5
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:07,200
- I mean... what am I doin' wrong?
- Earl, sit down.

6
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,280
Sure, you've got a great product,

7
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,750
but you have to remember
what you're really selling: yourself.

8
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,880
So it's not necessarily what I say
as how I say it?

9
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,920
<i>That's right, Earl.
A good salesman can sell anything.</i>

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,380
<i>And I remember when you were
a good salesman at the beginning.</i>

11
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,850
<i>Something's changed.
I don't want to pry,</i>

12
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,390
<i>but is everything all right at home,
with Margie?</i>

13
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,560
- Will there be anything else?
- Leave it.

14
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,230
- Just leave it.
- Yes, sir.

15
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,610
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

16
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,650
<i>I watched you walking in front
of my desk in an agitated manner,</i>

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,740
<i>smoking without having asked
if you could smoke in my presence.</i>

18
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,950
0121, mark.

19
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,120
OK, listen up. Fire team
discipline in there at all times.

20
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,500
Keep your radios on at all times
during the entire penetration.

21
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,130
Check yourselves. False IDs?

22
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,010
- Jim.
- No wallets, no keys?

23
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,680
We rendezvous where?
The Watergate, room 214. When?

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,560
At 0300 hours.

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,020
<i>Jawohl, mein fartin' f√ºhrer.</i>

26
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,690
I swear, Frank,
I'm gonna make you a new asshole.

27
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,440
Let's get the fuck out of here.

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,610
Years of decency
and clean living are over.

29
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,280
If anything goes wrong, sit tight.
You'll hear from me or Howard.

30
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,030
Personally, if anything goes wrong,

31
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,870
I'll be calling the President
of the United States.

32
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,450
<i>I'm not just gonna be
a good salesman.</i>

33
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,040
<i>No, doggone it,
I'm gonna be a great salesman.</i>

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,290
- That's the spirit.
- Thanks.

35
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,630
And remember, Earl,
always look them in the eye.

36
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,300
Nothing sells like sincerity.

37
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,980
<i>Five men wearing
white surgical gloves, business suits,</i>

38
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,020
<i>carrying camera and electronic
surveillance equipment</i>

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,030
<i>were arrested in the headquarters
of the Democratic Committee.</i>

40
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,740
<i>They were unarmed.
Nobody knows yet why they were there</i>

41
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,910
<i>or what they were looking for.</i>

42
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,260
Good evening, General Haig.

43
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,180
Good evening, sir.

44
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,310
<i>Judge John Sirica today
sentenced the Watergate burglars</i>

45
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,530
<i>to terms ranging up to 40 years.</i>

46
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,860
<i>The White House continues
to deny any involvement.</i>

47
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,240
<i>Presidential counsel, John Dean,</i>

48
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,950
<i>testified before
the Senate Watergate committee</i>

49
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,500
<i>that the scandal reaches
to the highest levels.</i>

50
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,380
<i>Presidential aides
Haldeman and Ehrlichman</i>

51
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,300
<i>were ordered to resign today.</i>

52
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,510
<i>In a stunning announcement, White
House aide Alexander Butterfield</i>

53
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,590
<i>revealed the existence
of a secret taping system.</i>

54
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,470
<i>Vice President Agnew resigned
today after pleading no contest</i>

55
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,560
<i>to a charge of income tax evasion.</i>

56
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,940
<i>The president has fired
the Watergate special prosecutor,</i>

57
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,360
<i>Archibald Cox, provoking the greatest
constitutional crisis in history.</i>

58
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,200
<i>Eight resolutions
calling for the impeachment</i>

59
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,030
<i>of the president were referred
to the judiciary committee by the House.</i>

60
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,040
<i>It was disclosed to Judge Sirica</i>

61
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,200
<i>that there is
an 18-and-a-half-minute gap</i>

62
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,330
<i>in a June 20th, 1972
taped conversation</i>

63
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,750
<i>between the president
and Bob Haldeman.</i>

64
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,840
<i>Shock and anger are coming
from all sectors of the nation.</i>

65
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,970
<i>Sirica ordered the president
to turn over tapes</i>

66
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,220
<i>to special prosecutor Leon Jaworski.</i>

67
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,930
<i>The tapes contain conversations
between the president and his aides</i>

68
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,060
<i>and are believed to include discussions
of the scandal.</i>

69
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,310
<i>The White House has not yet
responded to Judge Sirica's order</i>

70
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,150
<i>and it is not yet known
whether the president will comply.</i>

71
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,530
Yeah.

72
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,880
These are the tapes you requested,
Mr. President.

73
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,850
OK.

74
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,030
Cocksucker!

75
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,160
Nixon's never been good
with these things, Al.

76
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll take care of it, sir.
Do you mind, sir?

77
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,210
- Sorry.
- OK. Go on.

78
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,260
You know, Al,

79
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,970
if Hoover were alive,

80
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,980
these tapes would never have gotten out.

81
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,650
I want the little shit back.

82
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,940
- Mr. Hoover was a realist, sir.
- Yeah. Not like the others.

83
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,780
Dean, McCord, the rest.

84
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,410
We never got our side
of the story out, Al.

85
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,580
People have forgotten.

86
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,880
Such violence.

87
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,590
The tear gassing, the riots,

88
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,010
burning the draft cards,

89
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,220
the Black Panthers.

90
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,340
We fixed it, Al,
and they hate me for it.

91
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,640
'Cause it's Nixon.
They always hated Nixon.

92
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,850
You're all set, sir.

93
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,860
- OK.
- Good night, Mr. President.

94
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,980
Good night, Al.

95
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,910
Hey, Al.

96
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,330
Men in your profession,

97
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,870
give 'em a pistol
and then leave the room.

98
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,880
I don't have a pistol, Al.

99
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,980
Goddamn it.

100
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,190
Pause.

101
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,200
Start.

102
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,370
<i>- They did what?
- Install bugs, photo documents.</i>

103
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,700
<i>It was a fishing expedition. It was
their fourth attempt at the DNC.</i>

104
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,540
<i>O'Brien doesn't use that office.</i>

105
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,210
<i>Possibly looking for an illegal
Hughes donation to the Democrats,</i>

106
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,920
<i>so they couldn't make an issue
of your Hughes money.</i>

107
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,260
<i>It was a legal contribution.</i>

108
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,180
<i>Not clear the burglars
knew what they were looking for.</i>

109
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,600
They were headed for
McGovern's office later that same night.

110
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,390
- Christ, did Mitchell know?
- I don't know.

111
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,190
Mitchell's out of his mind.
Martha put her head through a window.

112
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,770
- Jesus. Through a window?
- Yeah, they're taking her to Bellevue.

113
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,530
- Maybe she'll stay this time.
- Martha's an idiot.

114
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,280
She'll do anything
to get Mitchell's attention.

115
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,370
If Mitchell had been minding the store
instead of Martha,

116
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,910
we wouldn't have Magruder
running some third-rate burglary.

117
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,540
We feel the bigger concern
is Gordon Liddy.

118
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,000
- Liddy? That fruitcake? What about him?
- That's just it, sir. He is a nut.

119
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,800
Used to work with the plumbers,
turns up running this Watergate caper.

120
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,380
Remember his plan to firebomb Brookings
using Cubans as firemen?

121
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,470
- What's Liddy got?
- He was using some campaign cash

122
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,760
that was laundered for us
through Mexico, the FBI's onto it.

123
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,940
- We could have a problem with that.
- That's a campaign finance violation.

124
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,980
- So if...
- Liddy takes the rap for Watergate,

125
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,650
we can take care of him
and that lets us off the hook.

126
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,240
I don't have time for this.
Just handle it, Bob.

127
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Keep it out of the White House.
I gotta see Kissinger.

128
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,950
He's throwing a tantrum,
threatening to quit. Again.

129
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,290
What else?

130
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,420
Well, sir, one of the people implicated
is still on the White House payroll.

131
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,630
Who? Not another goddamn Cuban.

132
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,470
Uh, no, sir. A guy named Hunt.

133
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,050
Howard Hunt, sir.

134
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,270
Hunt? Howard Hunt?

135
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,480
Left his White House
phone number in his hotel room.

136
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,230
He works for Colson.
He used him on the Pentagon Papers.

137
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,990
After arrest, he dumps his wiretapping
stuff into his White House safe.

138
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,030
We're trying to figure out when he
stopped being a White House consultant.

139
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,250
Howard Hunt is working
for the White House? Jesus Christ.

140
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,620
This is goddamn Disneyland.
Since when?

141
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,000
Since Chappaquiddick.
He wanted dirt on Kennedy.

142
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,960
- Colson brought him in.
- You know Hunt, sir?

143
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,550
Yeah, on the list of horribles.

144
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,640
I know what he is
and I know what he tracks back to.

145
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,310
- He was involved in the plumbers?
- Definitely.

146
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,060
Colson had him break into Bremer's
apartment after Bremer shot Wallace

147
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,440
to plant McGovern's campaign literature.

148
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,360
I had nothing to do with that.

149
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,320
- He was in this Ellsberg thing?
- Yes. You approved it.

150
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,910
- I did?
- Right after the Pentagon Papers broke.

151
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,870
They went in to get his psychiatric
records. We were working on China.

152
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,420
Fuck.

153
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,810
What the fuck?! You're not
supposed to take pictures of me!

154
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,680
Take pictures of the files!
Give me the fuckin' film!

155
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,650
Howard Hunt.

156
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:10,530
Jesus Christ. You open up that scab,
you'll uncover a lot of pus.

157
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,900
What do you mean?

158
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,450
- Where's Hunt now?
- He's in hiding.

159
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,910
- He sent Liddy in to talk to Dean.
- And?

160
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,960
- He wants money.
- Pay him.

161
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,500
Pay him? I told him get out
of the country. It's crazy to start...

162
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,000
What the hell are you doing,
John, screwing with the CIA?

163
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,130
I don't care how much he wants.
Pay him.

164
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:38,470
- What are we paying him for, sir?
- Silence.

165
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,390
But you're covered.
It's only this Ellsberg thing,

166
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,730
and if that comes out,
it's national security.

167
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,990
Cut ourselves loose from these clowns,
and that's all there is to it.

168
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,660
No, it's more than that.
I want Hunt paid.

169
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,790
We've never done that before, sir.
How do we do it?

170
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,920
We should set up a Cuban defense fund
on this and take care of all of 'em.

171
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,130
- Should we talk to Trini about paying?
- Keep Trini out.

172
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,090
And for God's sake, keep Colson out.

173
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,590
It's time to baptize
our young counsel here, Mr. Dean.

174
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,470
That means John can never talk about it.
Attorney-client privilege.

175
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,060
So get to it.
John, you stay close to this, OK?

176
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,020
- Don't worry, sir.
- Good.

177
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,360
OK.

178
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,660
Did I approve the Ellsberg thing?

179
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,120
Huh?

180
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,700
I'm glad we tape
all these conversations,

181
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,370
but I never approved
the break-in at the Ellsbergs'.

182
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,500
Maybe I approved it after the fact.

183
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,050
Someday we gotta
start transcribing these tapes.

184
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,470
You approved that before the fact
because I went over it with you. But...

185
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,760
- No one's gonna see these tapes.
- Right.

186
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,390
It's more of a problem for Ehrlichman.
He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA IDs.

187
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,810
But... what else does Hunt have on us?

188
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,780
We gotta turn off the FBI, Bob.

189
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,450
You go to the CIA and tell Helms
that Hunt is blackmailing the president.

190
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,040
Tell him Hunt and his Cuban friends
know too damn much,

191
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,370
and, uh, if he goes public,
if Hunt goes public,

192
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,540
it will be a fiasco for the CIA.
He'll know what I'm talking about.

193
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,420
- All right.
- Play it tough.

194
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,840
That's the way they play it,
that's the way we're gonna play it.

195
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,640
Don't lie to Helms
and say there's no involvement.

196
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,310
Just say this is, uh,
a sort of comedy of errors,

197
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,600
bizarre, without getting into it.
And, uh...

198
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,310
Say the president believes

199
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,900
it's gonna open up the whole
Bay of Pigs thing again.

200
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,940
And tell Helms he should call
the FBI, call Pat Gray,

201
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,570
and say that we wish,
for the sake of the country,

202
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:06,120
don't go any further
into this... hanky-panky, period.

203
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,040
Bay of Pigs?
That was Kennedy's screw-up.

204
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,130
- Why would that threaten us?
- Just do what I say, Bob.

205
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,090
<i>The only problem
with that, sir...</i>

206
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,050
<i>- ...gets us to obstruction of justice.
- Got nothing to do with justice.</i>

207
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,300
<i>- It's national security.
- How is this national security?</i>

208
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,560
<i>The president says it is.</i>

209
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,220
<i>Now, this isn't a moral issue, Bob.</i>

210
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,140
<i>My job is to protect this country
from its enemies,</i>

211
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,940
<i>and its enemies are inside the walls.
We gotta keep our enemies at bay,</i>

212
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,990
<i>or our whole program
goes down the tubes.</i>

213
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,700
<i>Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union.</i>

214
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,160
<i>- Look at the big picture...
- Damn.</i>

215
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,910
<i>...we end up doing a hell of a lot
of good in this world.</i>

216
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,040
<i>Let's not screw it up
with a shit-ass, third-rate burglary.</i>

217
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,790
<i>What should
I tell Ziegler to tell the press?</i>

218
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,210
<i>Tell 'em what we always
tell 'em. Anything but the truth.</i>

219
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,590
<i>- Fuck!
- Say the president believes</i>

220
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,390
<i>it's gonna open up
the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.</i>

221
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,010
<i>- Put me in this position.
- Bay of Pigs?</i>

222
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,930
<i>- Expose me like this.
- Why would that threaten us?</i>

223
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,640
Why don't they fucking shoot me?

224
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,850
In the election of 1860,

225
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,530
Lincoln said the question
was whether this nation could exist,

226
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,190
half-slave or half-free.

227
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,660
In the election of 1960,
with the world around us,

228
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,950
the question is whether the world
will exist half-slave or half-free.

229
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,210
I think, in the final analysis,
it depends upon what we do here

230
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,380
in the United States. I think
it's time America started moving again.

231
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,380
- Mr. Nixon?
- When it comes to experience,

232
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,550
through the years I have sat
on the National Security Council,

233
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,220
I have been in the cabinet,

234
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,140
I have met with
the legislative leaders...

235
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,770
- Be quiet.
- Relax, everybody, relax.

236
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,770
...discussions with 35 presidents,
nine prime ministers,

237
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,860
- two emperors and the Shah of Iran.
- Jesus Christ.

238
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,570
Has he told them
how many push-ups he can do yet?

239
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,370
- ...hydroelectric power.
- What the hell happened?

240
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,200
He just got out of the hospital.

241
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,990
He hasn't taken one hour off.

242
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,000
When we consider
the line-up of the world,

243
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,880
we find there are 590 million people
on our side,

244
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,500
800 million people
on the Communist side...

245
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,670
- Shoulda slapped makeup on.
- It's not a beauty contest.

246
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,680
- We'd better hope not.
- ...600 million people who are neutral.

247
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,430
What are you doing to him, Murray?
He's not well.

248
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,350
- He doesn't have to debate Kennedy.
- The odds are 5-3 against us.

249
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,060
- When it comes to politics...
- He can win without this.

250
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,230
Senator, one minute for rebuttal.

251
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,530
Castro is only the beginning of our
difficulties throughout Latin America.

252
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,110
Oh, shit, he's gonna do it.
Here it comes.

253
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,070
We've seen Cuba go
to the Communists.

254
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,490
Eight jet minutes
from the coast of Florida.

255
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,660
We must attempt to strengthen the
democratic anti-Castro forces in exile.

256
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,790
These fighters have had
no support from our government.

257
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,630
- Son of a bitch!
- What?

258
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,960
Kennedy was briefed last week
by CIA. He's using it against us.

259
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,970
We can't respond,
he welshed on a deal.

260
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,010
- It's a disgrace.
- ...we might never have had Castro.

261
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,600
- Why didn't we?
- Mr. Nixon?

262
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,640
- Man, he's treading water.
- All right, come on.

263
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,480
He violated national security.
Attack the bastard.

264
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,820
<i>...Constitution of the United States,
so help me God.</i>

265
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,110
- Mr. Nixon.
- Yeah.

266
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,200
I think...

267
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,830
I think that's the sort
of, uh, very dangerous

268
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:42,000
- and irresponsible suggestion that...
- It's over. More coffee?

269
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,340
...helping Cuban exiles
who oppose Castro would

270
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,710
not only be a violation
of international law,

271
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,180
it would be an open invitation
for Mr. Khrushchev...

272
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,390
<i>It's still very close.</i>

273
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,640
<i>Senator Kennedy's lead
is about, uh, 700,000.</i>

274
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,400
Think Daley stuffed
the ballot boxes himself?

275
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,860
In Texas,
they had the goddamn cattle voting.

276
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,610
It was he closest race in history,
Dick, and he stole it. Son of a bitch.

277
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,870
He outspent us and he still cheated.

278
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,330
A guy who's got everything.

279
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,490
I can't believe it.

280
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,460
We came to Congress together. We were
like brothers, for Christ's sake.

281
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,040
Got all the figures. It's an obvious
fraud. We ask for a recount.

282
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,920
Don't be ridiculous. Nobody has
contested a presidential election.

283
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,800
Who's gonna do the counting?
The Democrats control Texas, Illinois.

284
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,390
- We shift 25,000 votes in two states.
- And how long will that take?

285
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,810
- Six months, a year?
- What happens to the country?

286
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,810
If I'd called his shot on Cuba,
I'd have won.

287
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,980
- That's what I say.
- Made me look soft.

288
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,530
"I feel very sorry for Nixon

289
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,450
because he does not know who he is."
You believe this?

290
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:56,370
"At each stop he has to decide which
Nixon he's going to be at the moment,

291
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:59,740
which must be very exhausting."
Jack Kennedy.

292
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,660
- It's a disgrace.
- "Nixon is a shifty-eyed goddamn liar.

293
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,000
If he had to stick to the truth,
he'd have very little to say.

294
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,760
If you vote for Nixon, then you
oughta go to hell." Harry S. Truman.

295
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,090
That's what killed us, Dick, not Cuba.

296
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,720
It's the personality problem. You gonna
let the Democrats get away with this?

297
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,430
Goes to Harvard. His father hands him
everything on a silver platter.

298
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,900
All my life,
they've been sticking it to me.

299
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:32,070
Not the right clothes, not
the right schools, not the right family.

300
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,280
And then he steals from me.

301
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,780
Heh, he says I have no class,
and they love him for it.

302
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,450
Dick, you're only 47.

303
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,460
If you contest this election,
you'll be finished.

304
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,250
You gotta swallow this one.
They stole it fair and square.

305
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,920
We'll get 'em next time, Dick.

306
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,640
We'll get 'em next time.

307
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,680
What makes you think there's
gonna be a next time, Murray?

308
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,230
Because if he's not this Nixon,

309
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,980
he's nobody.

310
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,990
- Good morning, sir.
- Hi.

311
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,580
- Hi.
- Hi.

312
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,750
We lost.

313
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,800
I know.

314
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,220
I hate to lose.

315
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,470
It makes us human.

316
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,480
It's not fair, Buddy.

317
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,520
I can take the insults,
I can take the name-calling.

318
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,230
But I can't take the losing.
I hate it.

319
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,330
We don't have to put ourselves
through this again, Dick.

320
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,370
We worked for it. We earned it.

321
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,290
- It's ours.
- It is. We know that.

322
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,880
And it's enough that we know.

323
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,260
Just think of the girls.

324
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,220
They're still young.

325
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,640
We never see them.

326
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:36,110
I lost my parents when I was young.
I don't want them to lose theirs.

327
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,290
Maybe I should get out of the game.

328
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,590
What do you think, Buddy?

329
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,920
And go back to being a lawyer.

330
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,220
End up with something solid,
some money at the end of the line.

331
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,140
You know, I, uh...

332
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,640
I keep thinking of my old man tonight.

333
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,980
- He was a failure too.
- You're not a failure, Dick.

334
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,570
You know how much money he
had in the bank when he died?

335
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,110
Nothing.

336
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,370
He was so damned honest.

337
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,290
But I miss him.

338
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,580
I miss him a hell of a lot.

339
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,480
- Dad! Dad!
- I got the beets for him.

340
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,770
- Dad.
- Is she in there?

341
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,030
I don't have time for you right now.
I got work to do.

342
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,660
- How is thy son?
- Very well, thank you.

343
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,670
- What'd he say?
- He said, in life,

344
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,250
- there's no free ride.
- What'd you say?

345
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,960
I told them I didn't need a ride,
I need a suit.

346
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:27,260
Oh, no. Harold,
he doesn't respond well to humor.

347
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,970
Maybe Mother can help straighten it out.

348
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,180
I'd rather get a whippin'
than listen to another of her talks.

349
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,150
Relax, Dick.

350
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,480
Donald, finish thy sweeping,
then pick out the bad apples.

351
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,030
Yes, Mother.

352
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,570
I'm working.

353
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,620
Richard, come with me, would thee?

354
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,710
Why me?

355
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,930
Because Harold hast thy father's will
is no reason to admire him.

356
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:11,060
Let Harold's worldliness
be a warning to thee, not an example.

357
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,810
Yes, Mother.

358
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,270
Harold may have lost touch
with his Bible,

359
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,150
but thee must never lapse.

360
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,030
Now, give it to me.

361
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,950
Do not tell a lie, Richard.

362
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,710
The corn silk cigarette Harold
gave thee behind the store this morning.

363
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,420
I don't have them. Mother, I...

364
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,460
I promise I didn't smoke.

365
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,170
I see.

366
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:52,680
Well, then Richard, we have
nothing more to talk about, do we?

367
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,060
Please!

368
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,180
Please.

369
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,350
Mother, I'm sorry. It was...

370
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,690
It was just one time. I'm sorry.

371
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,700
So am I.

372
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,280
Thy father will have
to know of thy lying.

373
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,700
No, please, don't... don't...
don't tell him.

374
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,040
I'll never do it again,
I promise. Please.

375
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,790
- Richard, I expected more from thee.
- Please, Mama.

376
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,260
I shall never let thee down again.

377
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,760
Then this shall be our little secret.

378
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,680
Remember, I see into thy soul.

379
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,610
Thee may fool the world,
even thy father,

380
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,610
but not me, Richard. Never me.

381
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,820
Mother...

382
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,910
...think of me always
as thy faithful dog.

383
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,390
- Thank you.
- We'll say grace in the next room.

384
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,730
- Richard.
- Is it my turn?

385
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,490
Oh, Heavenly Father,
we humbly thank you...

386
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,700
I'll do it. There's a couple
of things I wanna say.

387
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,450
Could thee at least remove
thy apron, Frank?

388
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,210
This blood pays the bills, Hannah.
I'm not ashamed of how I earn my money.

389
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,210
Heavenly Father,

390
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,550
you told Adam in the garden,
after that business with the snake,

391
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:58,350
that man would have to earn his way
by the sweat of his face.

392
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,600
Well, as far as I can tell, Father,

393
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,560
what was true in Eden
is true in Whittier, California.

394
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,730
So we ask you now to remind
certain of our young people

395
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,690
the only way to get a new suit to go to
the promenade with Margaret O'Herlihy,

396
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,530
who happens to be a Catholic,
by the way,

397
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,990
is to work for it. Amen.

398
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,080
- Amen.
- Amen.

399
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,920
- Amen.
- Are we gonna pray now, Daddy?

400
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,340
- Don't be silly.
- You think this is funny?

401
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,880
Maybe a trip to the
wood shed'll straighten you out.

402
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,300
Pretty soon you boys are gonna
have to get out there and scratch.

403
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,260
'Cause you're not gonna
get anywhere on your good looks.

404
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,520
Just ask those fellas.

405
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,060
Charity's only gonna get you so far,

406
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,900
even with saints
like your mother around.

407
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,110
Struggle's what gives life meaning.
Not victory, struggle.

408
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,900
When you quit struggling,
they've beaten you.

409
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,160
And then you end up in the street
with your hand out.

410
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,910
<i>My mother was a saint,</i>

411
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,370
<i>but my old man struggled his whole life.</i>

412
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,920
<i>They could call him a little man,
a poor man,</i>

413
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,590
<i>but they never beat him.</i>

414
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:18,090
<i>I always tried to remember that,
when things didn't go my way.</i>

415
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,100
Let's really get fired up now!

416
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:25,230
-Get on your stand, Nixon!
- Twenty-eight, 44!

417
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,410
- What's Nixon doing here?
- He thinks he can make it.

418
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,990
Four years of being a tackling dummy.
Poor guy.

419
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,080
- All right! Let's go, defense!
- Hike!

420
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:54,130
Worst athlete I've ever seen.
But he's got guts.

421
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,720
OK, let's go! Let's do it!

422
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,010
<i>In California's gubernatorial race,
Nixon returned to the political arena</i>

423
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:09,310
<i>in a long and acrimonious bid against
popular incumbent Edmund G. Brown.</i>

424
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,150
<i>Brown's campaign has benefited greatly
from the support of President Kennedy,</i>

425
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,610
<i>while Nixon has had trouble
convincing voters</i>

426
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,990
<i>this is not another run
for the presidency.</i>

427
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,240
<i>With only a few precincts
left unreported,</i>

428
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:21,950
<i>all indications are
of another defeat for Nixon,</i>

429
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,870
<i>all indications are
of another defeat for Nixon,</i>

430
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,160
<i>who lost the presidency just two
years ago by a paper-thin margin.</i>

431
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,540
<i>It seems his brief political comeback</i>

432
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,540
<i>- is in ruins.
- Making a statement?</i>

433
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,460
Thank you, Fidel Castro.

434
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:40,010
- You're not going to blame Castro?
- I sure am!

435
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,180
Goddamn missile crisis united
the country behind Kennedy.

436
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,850
He was supporting Brown.
People were scared.

437
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,980
Castro staged this just to beat you.

438
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,520
Before you join the jubilation
of my being beaten,

439
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,810
remember people vote
not out of love but fear.

440
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:58,240
They don't teach that at Sunday school
or the Whittier Community Playhouse.

441
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,360
- I should go check in with our people.
- I'm glad they don't, Dick.

442
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,580
I'm glad they don't because life
is tough and it is unfair

443
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,330
and sometimes you forget
that in your self pity.

444
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,750
You forget sometimes, Dick, that I had
a life before you, before California.

445
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,510
Cocksucker!

446
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,100
Don't you want to listen
to Governor Brown's victory speech?

447
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,600
Nope. Not going to listen
to any more speeches ever again.

448
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,640
Amen to that.

449
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,850
It's over, Dick.

450
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,280
- I'll concede in the morning.
- Not that.

451
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,160
Buddy?

452
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,640
I have always stood by you.

453
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,310
I campaigned for you
when I was pregnant.

454
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,190
During Checkers, when Ike
wanted you out, I told you to fight.

455
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,650
This is different, Dick.

456
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,200
You've changed.

457
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,160
You've grown more bitter,
like you're at war with the world.

458
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,250
You weren't that way before.

459
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,630
I'm 50 years old now, Dick.

460
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,460
How many millions of miles
have I traveled?

461
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,170
How many millions of peoples' hands
have I shaked I just don't like?

462
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,890
How many thank-you notes have I written?

463
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:51,140
It's as if I, I don't know,
just went to sleep a long time ago

464
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,430
and missed the years between.

465
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,480
I've had enough.

466
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,320
What are you saying?
What are you talking about?

467
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,910
I want a divorce.

468
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,990
My God. Divorce?
What about the girls?

469
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,130
The girls'll grow up. They only
know you from television anyway.

470
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:23,380
- It'll ruin us, our family.
- No, you're ruining us.

471
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,050
If we stay with you,
you'll take us down with you.

472
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,300
This isn't political.
This is our life.

473
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,850
Everything's political.

474
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,520
- I'm political, you're political.
- No, I'm not. I'm finished.

475
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,730
Well, this is just
what they want, Buddy.

476
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,610
Don't you see?

477
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,490
They want to drive us apart, to beat us.

478
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,580
We can't let them do it.

479
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,710
We've been through too much together.

480
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,080
We belong together.

481
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,340
That's what you said
the first time we met.

482
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,170
You didn't even know me.

483
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,970
Oh, yes, I did.

484
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,770
I asked you to marry me, didn't I?

485
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,640
On our first date.

486
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,020
I said it because I knew...

487
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,690
I knew you were the one.

488
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,570
So solid.

489
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,110
So strong.

490
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,410
- So beautiful.
- Hi, I'm Pat Ryan.

491
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,080
- Richard Nixon.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

492
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,960
Pleasure to meet you.

493
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,060
Well, in a way, yes.

494
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,310
Don't tell me you've
been cutting my part.

495
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:03,150
Of course, honey, you know I
would never deceive you. Don't you?

496
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,890
You were the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen.

497
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,430
I don't want to lose you.

498
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,810
- Ever.
- Dick, don't.

499
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,610
You really want me to quit?

500
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,290
We can be happy.

501
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,620
We really can.

502
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,130
The girls and I love you, Dick.

503
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,180
And if I stop,

504
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:19,060
there'll be no more talk of divorce?

505
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,570
I'll do it. No more.

506
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,820
Are you serious?

507
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,700
Yeah. I'm out.

508
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,750
Is that the truth?

509
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,840
I'll never run again. I promise.

510
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,760
Yeah.

511
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,890
I love you, Buddy.

512
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,140
I love you.

513
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,020
I love you.

514
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,560
Where are they?

515
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:13,110
- You don't have to make a statement.
- No!

516
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:18,070
Gentlemen, I can tell you Mr. Nixon
is a man who is graceful in defeat,

517
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,080
and if he was here with us...

518
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,460
Can I have some quiet, please?

519
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,170
Give the... Just a second!

520
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,880
Some quiet, please. Quiet!

521
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,470
Thank you!

522
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,640
- Mr. Nixon!
- Uh... Ahem.

523
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,230
I believe Governor Brown has a heart,

524
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,810
even though he believes I do not.

525
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,980
I believe he's a good American,

526
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,650
even though he feels I am not.

527
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:59,990
I'm proud of the fact that I
defended my opponent's patriotism.

528
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,410
You gentlemen didn't report it,
but I'm proud I did that. And...

529
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,000
And I would appreciate,
for once, gentlemen,

530
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,710
if you would just print what I say.

531
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,340
For 16 years, uh,
ever since the Hiss case,

532
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,840
you've had a lot of fun. A lot of fun.

533
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,350
But recognize you have a responsibility,

534
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,850
if you're against the candidate,
to give him the shaft.

535
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,600
But if you do that, at least put
one lonely reporter on the campaign

536
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:34,190
who will report
what the candidate says now and then.

537
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:39,240
I think, all in all,
I've given as good as I've taken.

538
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,070
But as I leave you, I...

539
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,040
I want you to know,
just think what you're gonna be missing.

540
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,410
You won't have Nixon
to kick around anymore.

541
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,290
Kick around anymore.

542
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,630
Uh...

543
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:05,060
Because, gentlemen,
this is my last press conference.

544
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,730
- Thank you and good day.
- Is this the end of politics for you?

545
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,860
Will you run again?

546
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,780
<i>In California, we can
officially write the political obituary</i>

547
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,080
<i>of Richard Milhous Nixon.
A small town lawyer like Lincoln,</i>

548
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,910
<i>Nixon became a representative at 33
and a senator at 35,</i>

549
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,370
<i>as part of the postwar Republican sweep
of the congressional elections</i>

550
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,340
<i>that attacked FDR's
big-government New Deal.</i>

551
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,920
<i>Running as
a South Pacific veteran,</i>

552
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,170
<i>victories over
Congressman Jerry Voorhis</i>

553
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,590
<i>and Senator Helen Gahagan Douglas
made it clear that, to Nixon,</i>

554
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,600
<i>politics was war. He didn't
have opponents, he had enemies.</i>

555
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,980
Why, she's pink,
right down to her underwear!

556
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,900
<i>Nixon became one of the
leading lights on the notorious</i>

557
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,610
<i>House Un-American Activities Committee,
questioning labor leaders,</i>

558
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,650
<i>Spanish Civil War veterans,
Hollywood celebrities.</i>

559
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,160
<i>- They'd all be sent back to Russia.
- But it was the Alger Hiss case</i>

560
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,120
<i>that made Nixon a household name.</i>

561
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,240
<i>One of the architects
of the United Nations,</i>

562
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,700
<i>intimate of FDR
and Oliver Wendell Holmes,</i>

563
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,370
<i>Alger Hiss was
a State Department diplomat</i>

564
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,210
<i>accused by freelance journalist
Whittaker Chambers</i>

565
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,880
<i>of passing secret documents
to the Soviet Union.</i>

566
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,420
<i>- Hiss is lying.
- Hiss claimed he was being set up</i>

567
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,010
<i>by Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover
to discredit the New Deal's policies.</i>

568
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:30,100
<i>I am not, and never have been,
a member of the Communist party.</i>

569
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,930
<i>The case came down
to an Underwood typewriter</i>

570
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,230
<i>and a roll of film hidden
in a pumpkin patch.</i>

571
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:41,820
<i>I asked Hiss if he'd known Chambers.
When he said no, I knew he was lying.</i>

572
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,150
<i>I knew I had him.</i>

573
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,240
<i>After two trials, Hiss was
convicted not of spying but of perjury.</i>

574
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,990
<i>To some, Nixon was a hero and a patriot.</i>

575
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,080
<i>But to many, he was a self-promoter.</i>

576
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,290
<i>Eleanor Roosevelt
angrily condemned him.</i>

577
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:59,670
<i>Nixon continued to tear into Truman,
Acheson and the Democratic party</i>

578
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,340
<i>for losing mainland China in 1949,</i>

579
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,840
<i>and blamed the Korean War
on a weak foreign policy.</i>

580
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,600
<i>I promise to expose and to continue
to expose the people that have sold</i>

581
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,140
<i>- this country down the river!
- His speeches, if more subtle</i>

582
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,230
<i>than those of his Republican ally,
Joe McCarthy, were just as aggressive.</i>

583
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,980
<i>The direct result
of Truman's decision</i>

584
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,190
<i>is that China has gone Communist!</i>

585
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,150
<i>Mao is a monster! Why?</i>

586
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,530
<i>Who in the State Department
is watching over American interests?</i>

587
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,830
<i>Who has given the Russians
the atomic bomb?</i>

588
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:36,920
<i>The Soviet Union is an example of the
slave state in the ultimate development.</i>

589
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,880
<i>Driven by demons that
seemed more personal than political,</i>

590
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,970
<i>Nixon became Eisenhower's
vice presidential candidate in 1952.</i>

591
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,050
<i>But then came the Checkers crisis.</i>

592
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,050
<i>Nixon was accused
of hiding a secret slush fund.</i>

593
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,640
<i>About to be kicked off the ticket
by Ike, he went live on television...</i>

594
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,980
<i>- ...in an unprecedented appearance.
- ...give this television audience</i>

595
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,070
<i>a complete financial history.
Everything I've earned...</i>

596
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,690
<i>The list included their house,
their Oldsmobile,</i>

597
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,860
<i>Pat's Republican cloth coat. And lastly,
in what was to become history,</i>

598
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,030
<i>a sentimental gift
from a Texas businessman.</i>

599
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,580
<i>You know what it was? It was a little
cocker spaniel dog in a crate</i>

600
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,870
<i>that he'd sent
all the way from Texas,</i>

601
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,210
<i>black and white, spotted.
And our little girl Tricia,</i>

602
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,290
<i>the six-year-old, named it Checkers.</i>

603
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,260
<i>- Fifty-eight million people saw it.
- Like all kids, they love the dog.</i>

604
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,550
<i>It was shameless. It was manipulative.</i>

605
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,720
<i>Regardless of what they say about him,
we're gonna keep him.</i>

606
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,850
<i>It was a huge success.</i>

607
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,100
<i>He stayed on the national scene,
serving two terms as vice president</i>

608
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:44,360
<i>under Eisenhower, against Khrushchev
at the Kitchen Debate in Moscow</i>

609
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,240
<i>and stoned by Latin mobs in Venezuela.
Nixon once again became a national hero.</i>

610
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,410
<i>But it all came to a crashing end
against Kennedy in 1960</i>

611
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,080
<i>and Pat Brown in California in '62.</i>

612
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,670
<i>And thus ends
a great American political story.</i>

613
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,590
<i>The truth is we never knew
who Richard Nixon really was,</i>

614
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,670
<i>and now that he is gone, we never will.</i>

615
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,470
Poor little Tricia.

616
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,230
I told her her daddy couldn't get a job
in this city when he got out of Duke.

617
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:25,020
Every white-shoe lawyer firm turned
me down. Didn't have the right look.

618
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,650
- I couldn't even get into the FBI.
- Hi! How are ya?

619
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,900
Did you catch that picture of you
in the news last week, Dick?

620
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:33,780
- You were standin' on Fifth Avenue.
- Oh, yeah.

621
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:37,870
You were lookin' straight ahead and
everyone else was lookin' the other way,

622
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,370
- like you just farted or somethin'.

623
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,340
It said, "Who remembers Dick Nixon?"

624
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,170
Unbelievable. I was screamin'.

625
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,210
Yeah, that was hilarious, Martha.

626
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,970
They were looking the other direction,
waiting for the light to change.

627
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,600
Typical of the press,
they wouldn't correct it.

628
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,350
I think we oughta catch Rocky
before he leaves.

629
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,140
I'm sure it's just a little
run of bad luck, Mr. Nixon.

630
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,150
- He can walk this direction, can't he?
- Oh, I don't know.

631
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:08,940
- I've read some nice things about you.
- Maybe where you come from.

632
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:13,780
But where I come from, Dick Nixon is
as misunderstood as a fox in a henhouse.

633
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,030
And do you know why?
Because, my darlin',

634
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,370
they all think that
your smile and your face

635
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:22,750
are never in the same place
at the same time.

636
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,630
You and me, we're gonna
have to work on that, sweetie.

637
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,380
Someone freshen Martha's drink.
She's down a quart.

638
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,050
Well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah!

639
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:35,390
- I think he is frightened by my charm.
- I know I am.

640
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,890
- Pat can't stand her.
- It's the thing she does.

641
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,890
- She talks at night.
- Talks all day too.

642
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,060
How the hell can you
put up with her, John?

643
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,980
Well, I'm in love with her.
And she's great in bed.

644
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,650
If a Rockefeller can't
become president of the United States,

645
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,570
then what is the point of democracy?

646
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,530
The point of democracy is that even the
son of a grocer can become president.

647
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,910
And you came damn close, Dick.
How are you?

648
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,580
Hi, John.
New York treating you all right?

649
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,830
I'm sorry I haven't
been able to see you.

650
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,090
- You're looking happy, Rocky.
- Happy. Happy, Dick Nixon.

651
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,250
- You remember him.
- Nice to see you again.

652
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:16,840
- You're obviously making him happy.
- Oh! Repartee, Dick! That's marvelous!

653
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:21,260
What you predicting? Your boy
Goldwater gonna split the party?

654
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:24,020
- Some say you are, Rocky.
- Let me tell you something.

655
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:28,770
Every time the Republican party is a
home to extremism, we lose the election.

656
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,150
- You oughta know better than anybody.
- Yeah.

657
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,940
This guy Goldwater
is as stupid as McCarthy.

658
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:38,030
And McCarthy never did you any good
in the long run, now, did he?

659
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,870
That's right.

660
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:46,580
- I hate these cocktail parties.
- John, I'm in hell.

661
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,790
I'll be mentally dead in two years
and physically dead in four.

662
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,970
Make some money, Dick.
Prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd.

663
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:59,640
Let Goldwater and Rockefeller
take the fall against Kennedy.

664
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,140
I don't know.
I miss making love to the people.

665
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,350
I miss entering a room.

666
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:08,600
I miss the pure acting of it, John.

667
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,360
I gotta get back in the arena.

668
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,400
Ladies and gentlemen, it's showtime!

669
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:22,490
Come on up.
Right this way, ladies and gentlemen.

670
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,910
It's for you, it's for me.
It's Studebaker for 1963.

671
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,830
Amen. Bless you for being here.
There's a man that loves Studebakers.

672
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,090
- Can I get your autograph?
- Mr. Nixon, please run again.

673
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:38,470
The ex-vice president of the United
States, Richard M. Nixon!

674
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,970
- You throw a hell of a party, Jack.
- The party ain't even started yet.

675
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,350
I've asked these gals out to the ranch
for a little private thing.

676
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,150
We're gonna have some fun,
I guarantee ya.

677
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,860
And there's some fellas
I'd really like you to meet.

678
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,940
Trini and I got an early plane. We're
hoping to be back in New York for...

679
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:03,120
It'll be OK. These guys are interesting.
And quiet. The girls are too.

680
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,370
It's not often us Texans
get an opportunity to entertain

681
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,790
- the future president.
- Here.

682
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:11,210
Like you said, Jack,
I'm just a New York lawyer.

683
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,420
- We'll see about that.
- Mr. Nixon, are you gonna run again?

684
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,750
- I don't know.
- He will! I guarantee it!

685
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,550
- Name it, baby.
- That little convertible?

686
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,100
I'll buy you a diamond ring.
I'll buy you one.

687
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,770
- Thank you.
- Hello, baby.

688
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,890
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

689
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:35,400
This is Julie there.
And that's Tricia.

690
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,240
- Oh, yeah.
- She reminds me a bit of you, Sandy.

691
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,370
She really is wholesome.
But, um, what about you?

692
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:47,830
- What do you like?
- Well, I like music.

693
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,910
- I like jazz.
- Jazz, yeah. Guy Lombardo.

694
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,370
How about rock and roll?

695
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,880
- Elvis Presley?
- Yeah, he's good. Yeah.

696
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,420
- Decent guy.
- Well, I guess,

697
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,050
for me, it also depends on
what I'm doin' to the music, Dick.

698
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,430
- Yeah.
- So, what's it like bein' so famous?

699
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,680
A vice president!

700
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:14,230
Well, it's, uh, not like that, Sandy.

701
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,730
You see, the reason I got
into politics in the first place was,

702
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,280
well, to do something for the people.

703
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,280
So, how are you two doing?

704
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:30,290
You know, Dick, there's more privacy
in the back of the...

705
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:35,120
- No, Trini, we're fine here.
- OK.

706
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,630
Hell, Kennedy just pissed Cuba away
to the Russians. Just pissed it away.

707
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,630
And he doesn't know what the hell
he's doin' in Vietnam.

708
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,300
These are dangerous times,
especially for business.

709
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,640
- Agreed.
- We know what you tried to do for Cuba.

710
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,560
If you had been elected in '60,
Castro would be dead now.

711
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,400
Gentlemen, I tried.
I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.

712
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,280
He heard me and he made his decision.
I appreciate your sentiments.

713
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:10,080
I've heard them
from many fine Cuban patriots.

714
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,660
But it's nothing
I can do anything about.

715
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:18,000
It's a long drive to Dallas. Trini and I
have a plane to catch tomorrow. So...

716
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,750
- Dick, these boys want you to run.
- Absolutely.

717
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,090
- That's right.
- Now, they're serious.

718
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:27,340
They can deliver the South
and put Texas in your column.

719
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,010
They would have done it in '60.

720
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,260
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
That'll never happen.

721
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,980
I don't think you know how much
people hate Kennedy down here.

722
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:40,360
He's comin' to town tomorrow, and they
will run his ass outta town on a rail!

723
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,690
- Damn right.
- That we will.

724
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,950
We are willing to give you a shit pot
full of money to get rid of him.

725
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,740
More than you ever dreamed of.

726
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:56,620
Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64
with all the money in the world.

727
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:04,130
Suppose Kennedy don't run in '64.

728
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,630
Not a chance.

729
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,720
Yeah.

730
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:16,140
Well, gentlemen, I promised my wife I...
I'm out of politics.

731
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,600
You just came down here for the weather,
is that right, Mr. Nixon?

732
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:24,900
I came down here
to close a deal for Studebaker.

733
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,070
- What about '68, Dick?
- Five years, Trini.

734
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,700
In politics, that's an eternity.

735
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:36,580
Dick... your country needs you.

736
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,870
Unfortunately, the country's
not available right now.

737
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,360
President Kennedy's due in
from Fort Worth in about an hour.

738
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,990
- Kennedy is due in from Fort Worth.
- Yeah, I know.

739
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,320
OK. Let's go through here.

740
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,780
- Excuse us.
- Excuse me. Coming through.

741
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,240
- Excuse us.
- Thank you.

742
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:21,250
Step away from the gate there.
Thank you.

743
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,720
Go find the pilot.
Let's get out of here.

744
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,760
Look, Edgar, these, uh...
these guys were really strange.

745
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:19,970
<i>- You know, extremists.
- What do you mean by "strange"?</i>

746
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,060
<i>- Right-wing stuff.
- Birchers?</i>

747
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,730
<i>- Birchers, yeah.
- This thing's pretty straight.</i>

748
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:28,860
<i>- In Dallas, Lee Harvey Oswald...
- Oswald's got a Cuba connection?</i>

749
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,190
<i>- To Castro?
- ...maximum security facility.</i>

750
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,910
<i>- Mrs. Kennedy...
- He's a real Communist.</i>

751
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,200
Well, that makes sense.

752
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,990
OK, well, thank you, Edgar.

753
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:46,290
<i>Senator Ted Kennedy, arriving early
this morning with his mother and sister.</i>

754
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:52,130
Hoover says this Oswald
checks out as a beatnik,

755
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,840
- a real bum.
- Dick, you should call Bobby.

756
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:58,890
He doesn't want me at the funeral.

757
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:02,140
- You don't have to go.
- De Gaulle's gonna be there.

758
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:07,730
<i>- McMillan. Adenauer.
- We go now to the rotunda...</i>

759
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,400
Nixon can't not be there.

760
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,490
Then call him.
I'm sure it was an oversight.

761
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:18,240
<i>- Yeah.
- ...to pay their respects...</i>

762
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,620
<i>- Jesus.
- ...to their fallen leader.</i>

763
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,910
It's awful.

764
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,670
- It's an awful thing for this country.
- Dick?

765
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,960
No, it's his way.

766
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:34,090
He hates me.

767
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,760
He and Teddy.

768
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,760
They always hated me.

769
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,140
They've lost their brother.
You know what that means, Dick.

770
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:48,060
<i>These are perhaps the last
images of him alive with his family.</i>

771
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,190
Please, make it stop!

772
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,070
Hold him tighter.
Hold him tighter.

773
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,120
Hold him tighter. Hold him tighter.

774
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,410
Daddy, please make it stop!

775
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,170
Hold him tighter.

776
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,460
The infection's spread to his spine.

777
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:13,960
Come on!

778
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,070
Stop it!

779
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:36,860
Get off!

780
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:58,050
You're it!

781
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,770
No. No, don't!

782
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:22,490
If I'd been president,
they never would've killed me.

783
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,540
<i>Vice President Johnson,
shown here being sworn in...</i>

784
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,790
- Dick, are you gonna call? Bobby.
- Hmm?

785
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:39,300
I'll go through Johnson.
We'll be invited.

786
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,970
<i>This is a sad time
for all people.</i>

787
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,890
<i>I ask for your help.</i>

788
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:55,360
<i>...and are going
to see Vietnam through</i>

789
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,820
<i>to an honorable peace...</i>

790
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,280
<i>...to defend an honored cause,</i>

791
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,410
<i>whatever the price,
whatever the burden...</i>

792
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:13,420
<i>...whatever the sacrifice
that duty may require.</i>

793
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:18,710
<i>Accordingly... I shall not seek...</i>

794
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,760
<i>...and I will not accept...</i>

795
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,970
<i>...the nomination of my party
for another term as your president.</i>

796
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,810
<i>Good night, and God bless all of you.</i>

797
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,520
<i>Johnson's withdrawal
resurrects Richard Nixon</i>

798
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:41,110
<i>as a strong Republican candidate
with a secret plan to end the war.</i>

799
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:44,450
<i>His mother, Hannah Nixon,
just before her death last year,</i>

800
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:47,200
<i>commented on her son's chances.</i>

801
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,790
Mrs. Nixon, do you think your son
will ever return to politics?

802
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:56,000
I don't think he has a choice.

803
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,920
He has always been a leader.

804
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,550
Do you think he'd make
a great president, Mrs. Nixon?

805
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,800
If he's on God's side, yes.

806
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:10,430
You must be very proud of your son.

807
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,730
I have always been proud
of all of my children.

808
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,150
Of course,
no one can see into the future.

809
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,480
We didn't know this day would come.

810
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:25,070
- Where'd he go?
- In the side door.

811
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,070
- Is that Mitchell?
- Shit! Missed him.

812
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,740
I thought that guy was gonna
kiss your hand on the side of it.

813
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,000
- Congratulations, sir.
- Yeah, thanks.

814
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,040
Jesus, Dick!
I've never seen anything like it.

815
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,630
Even the goddamn Times
is saying you've got it.

816
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:43,880
- Vietnam's gonna put you in there.
- We got the press this time.

817
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,680
- We got the big mo. We're back.
- So you've decided.

818
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,220
Were you planning to tell me?

819
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:58,900
We haven't announced
anything yet, but...

820
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,110
Jesus. Uh... Pat?

821
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:09,030
Uh, wait in the living room,
will you, fellas? What is it, John?

822
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,700
You need her, Dick. In '60,
she was worth five, six million votes.

823
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,370
Yeah. Don't worry.
I'll use the old Nixon charm.

824
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,960
In there. OK.

825
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,290
Who could resist that?

826
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,300
Buddy?

827
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,560
You should be going.

828
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,520
Primaries are soon,
aren't they? New Hampshire.

829
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,230
I love you, Buddy. I need you.

830
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,770
I don't want them to love me.

831
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,820
But I need you out there.

832
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:49,910
It won't be like the last time.
The war's crippled the Democrats.

833
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:52,570
I can win. We deserve it.

834
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:55,740
It's ours, Buddy, at last.

835
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:59,080
Nobody knows that better than you.

836
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,170
Frank Nixon's boy.

837
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:05,420
Do you remember what Mom said?
We're not like other people. We...

838
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,630
We don't choose our way.

839
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,930
We can really change things, Buddy.

840
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:14,600
We got a chance to get it right.
We can change America.

841
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:18,310
It was our dream, Buddy,
together, always.

842
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:24,440
- Do you really want this, Dick?
- Yeah. This, above all.

843
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:29,820
- And then you'll be happy?
- Yeah, you know I will. Yes! I will.

844
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,990
Then I'll be there for you.

845
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,950
And we are gonna win this time.
I can feel it.

846
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,540
Yeah!

847
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,460
You're the strongest woman
I ever met, Buddy.

848
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,630
- Can I just ask for one thing?
- Anything.

849
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,130
- Would you kiss me?
- Yeah!

850
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,810
We're gonna win the race.

851
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,810
<i>My thanks. It's on to Chicago
and let's win there. Thank you.</i>

852
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,810
I would never question
Senator Kennedy's patriotism.

853
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,650
But going around the country,
promising peace at any price

854
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,570
is, uh, exactly what the
North Vietnamese want to hear.

855
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,110
Cue the crowd.

856
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:18,540
Go to this bald guy.
Yeah, he's great, isn't he?

857
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:21,750
<i>I, unlike Senator Kennedy,</i>

858
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:24,670
<i>have a plan to end the war immediately.</i>

859
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:29,670
<i>But not for peace at any price,
but peace with honor.</i>

860
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,630
What do you think this plan is, Edgar?
A nuclear attack?

861
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,510
He's lying, Clyde. Always has.

862
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,100
That's why Nixon's always been useful.

863
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,100
Hold still.

864
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,770
- OK, who's next?
- The Negro.

865
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,480
No, we gotta have a Negro.
This guy right here.

866
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:50,610
Negro, front row.

867
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:55,030
- Mr. Nixon, sir.
- Yeah.

868
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,030
We all know you have built your career

869
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,040
on smearing people as Communists.

870
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,870
And now you are building your campaign

871
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,380
on the divisions in this country,

872
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,960
stirring up hatred
and turning people against each other.

873
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:13,220
- What the fuck's he doing? A speech!
- Cut him off.

874
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,760
- I can't. This isn't Russia.
- Sounds like a Negro.

875
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,470
- Saying Negro things. What's he doing?
- Sounded white when we screened.

876
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,560
Doesn't sound white now,
sounds like Angela Davis.

877
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,520
When are you gonna tell us
what you really stand for?

878
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,060
- Go to commercial!
- There are no commercials.

879
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,190
- You bought the whole half hour.
- Shit!

880
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:33,570
When are you going to take off that mask
and show us who you really are?

881
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:34,860
Shut up and sit down!

882
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:37,450
- OK. OK.
- It's a high hard one, chief.

883
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,990
- Park it.
- There are divisions in this country.

884
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,750
- That's because you created them.
- I did not. The Democrats did.

885
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:46,540
If it's dialogue you want,
you're more likely to get it from me

886
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,250
than from people burning down cities.
Just think about it.

887
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,550
- Dr. King said the same thing.
- Oh, please.

888
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:54,590
You know, young man,
who a great hero is? Abraham Lincoln.

889
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:57,220
- Abraham Lincoln.
- Lincoln. Is he beautiful?

890
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,350
He believed in common ground.
He brought this country together.

891
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,560
I love that man. I love him.

892
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,020
I want the son of a bitch
who got that agitator in here fired!

893
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,440
- I have another question.
- There's a little girl sitting here.

894
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,820
- A little girl sitting with a sign.
- Bag the spook. Go to the girl.

895
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:16,610
- Can you see the girl?
- There are three simple words:

896
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,990
"Bring us together."
That is what I want,

897
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:22,490
and that is what the great
silent majority of Americans want.

898
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:27,120
And that is why I want to be president.
To bring us together.

899
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,710
<i>- Give me a break, Mary.
- Now, you all know me. I'm one of you.</i>

900
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,130
<i>I grew up here,
a stone's throw from here,</i>

901
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:37,800
<i>- on a lemon ranch in Yorba Linda.
- Poorest lemon ranch in California.</i>

902
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,930
<i>Poorest lemon ranch in California,
I can assure you of that.</i>

903
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:44,930
<i>- My dad sold it before they found oil.
- My dad sold it before they found oil.</i>

904
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:48,270
<i>- But it was all we had.
- But it was all we had.</i>

905
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:53,230
<i>- My dad built the house with his hands.
- You're new here. What's your name?</i>

906
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,280
Joaquin, Mr. Hoover.

907
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,740
Oh.

908
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:04,080
<i>My father sacrificed everything he had
so that his sons could go to college.</i>

909
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,790
<i>- A gentle Quaker mother quietly wept
- Oh, Christ.</i>

910
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,500
<i>- when he went to war.
- Turn this crap off, Clyde.</i>

911
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,090
<i>- It's giving me a headache.
- A great teacher.</i>

912
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,760
You may go, Joaquin.

913
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:24,850
- I want to see him, Clyde.
- Edgar, he works in the kitchen.

914
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:28,560
Not the boy, you idiot. Nixon.

915
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:33,770
Hear what he said in Oregon
about me having too much power?

916
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:37,360
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again.

917
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,400
- Who do you want?
- Kennedy?

918
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,200
Never.

919
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,910
He'll fry in hell for what he did to me.

920
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,200
But Nixon don't know that.

921
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:52,500
Which is why I'm gonna have
to remind him that he needs us

922
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:55,460
a hell of a lot more than we need him.

923
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,780
Your boy's on the way up.

924
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,410
You know, I met this guy years ago
in Havana. You know that.

925
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,160
Come on!

926
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,130
He's folding, Johnny.

927
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,880
No, no, no.
You just wait a second.

928
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:44,880
<i>Olly's Boy on the inside!</i>

929
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,600
Come on! Come on!

930
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:58,900
<i>And a tragedy! Olly's Boy
has fallen on the sixteenth pole.</i>

931
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:05,700
<i>Sunday's Chance goes on
to win it in 25,000...</i>

932
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,620
A bit extreme, isn't it?

933
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,910
It's the drama.
Look, the crowd loves this shit.

934
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:15,620
May I have your autograph?

935
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:18,460
Hey, there's Randolph Scott over there.
Look at that.

936
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,710
Cash these for me, would you, Johnny?

937
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:27,180
- Easy! Easy, easy!
- It's a two-dollar bet, Edgar.

938
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:30,430
You got thousands coming on this.
I mean, what the fuck?

939
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:34,810
I told you, just cash it, Johnny.
And don't swear around me. Come on.

940
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,230
Uh-huh.

941
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,060
Hello.

942
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:43,740
Edgar. Wonderful to see you.

943
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,150
- Clyde.
- Mr. Nixon.

944
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,660
- Hi.
- Thank you for coming, Richard.

945
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:49,820
OK. Winning?

946
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:53,870
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
Are you gonna win?

947
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,000
You should ask Bobby.

948
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,130
- Little Bobby.
- Yeah, Bobby Kennedy.

949
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:00,670
Yeah.

950
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:03,300
Would you, uh, walk with me
down to the paddock?

951
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,340
- I'd like to look at the horses.
- Can we talk here?

952
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,930
I got the police chiefs in San Diego.

953
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:13,010
Actually, I'm trying
to spare you an embarrassment.

954
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:17,440
That was Johnny Roselli you just
passed. He's on his way back.

955
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,610
Roselli? Johnny Roselli?

956
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:27,030
Yes. You know him, Richard? No?
From Cuba?

957
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:36,080
- Hey, Johnny Roselli. How're you doin'?
- Dick Nixon.

958
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,500
How are you?

959
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,880
I never met the man. Uh...

960
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,800
Well, I know you've...

961
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:49,010
...been very careful not to.
That's why I'm so concerned.

962
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:52,550
OK.

963
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,850
<i>- They're off and running!</i>

964
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,730
You'll win the nomination.

965
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:09,900
- It could be 1960 all over again.
- Love you, Dick!

966
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:14,240
And Bobby's got the magic
like a goddamn rock star.

967
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:17,910
They climb all over each other
just to touch his clothes.

968
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,250
He'll ride his brother's corpse
right into the White House.

969
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:27,460
If things remain as they are.
He's got the anti-war vote.

970
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:30,550
Or he'll steal it, like his brother.

971
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,090
Bobby's a mean little son of a bitch.

972
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:36,970
He had the IRS audit my mother
when she was dying in the nursing home.

973
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:40,730
- I know.
- We should shoot the son of a bitch.

974
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:49,570
- I wanna fight just as dirty, Edgar.
- His women. Use his women.

975
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,700
Any information you have.

976
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,580
The son of a bitch is not
gonna steal from me again.

977
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:01,080
Can you back me up on this?
Can I count on your support?

978
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:07,300
I look at it from the point of view that
the system can only take so much abuse.

979
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:10,300
- It adjusts itself eventually.
- Yeah.

980
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:14,510
But there are times...
There are savage outbursts.

981
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:18,970
The late Dr. King, for example.
Amoral hypocrite.

982
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,810
Screwing women
like a degenerate tomcat,

983
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:26,900
stirring up the blacks,
preaching against our system.

984
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:30,690
Sometimes the system
comes very close to cracking.

985
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:37,080
We've already had one radical
in the White House.

986
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,410
I don't believe we
could survive another.

987
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:48,000
- Well, like I said, Edgar...
- You ask...

988
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,630
...if you can count on my support.

989
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,260
As long as I can count on yours.

990
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,310
Yeah.

991
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:04,190
Yeah, the old queen did it on purpose.

992
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,310
No, he wasn't protecting me.

993
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,230
- He was just putting me on notice.
- That he knew Roselli?

994
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,530
- No.
- Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.

995
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:16,280
Johnny Roselli wasn't just any gangster.

996
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:20,950
Johnny Roselli was one of the
gangsters who set up Track Two in Cuba.

997
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:25,330
Oh, well, I know all about that.

998
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:28,210
I don't understand it.
Track Two is Chile.

999
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:32,880
<i>Yeah, Chile, Congo,
Guadalajara, Iran, Cuba.</i>

1000
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,930
<i>Wherever there was need for, uh,
an executive action capability,</i>

1001
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:40,140
<i>there's Track Two.</i>

1002
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:45,310
In Cuba, Track One
was, uh, the Bay of Pigs invasion.

1003
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,900
Track Two was our idea.

1004
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:51,770
We thought that the invasion wouldn't
work unless we got rid of Castro.

1005
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:57,570
So we asked ourselves, uh,
"Who else wants Castro dead?"

1006
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,660
The Mafia or money people?

1007
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:03,620
So we put together Track Two.

1008
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:20,680
First assassination attempt was in '60.

1009
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:24,430
- Just before the election.
- Before? Eisenhower approved that?

1010
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,350
Yeah. Well, he didn't veto it.

1011
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,440
I ran the White House side,

1012
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,110
and the Mob contact was Johnny Roselli.

1013
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:40,410
One of the CIA guys was this jackass,
Howard Hunt.

1014
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,280
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

1015
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:45,910
Not just Howard Hunt,
but Frank Sturgis

1016
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,080
and all those other Cubans.

1017
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:52,090
All of them in the Watergate.

1018
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,670
They're all involved in Cuba.

1019
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:06,430
Yeah, Hunt reported to my military aide.

1020
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:10,350
I don't know how much Hunt knows
or the Cubans, but...

1021
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:13,690
...you never know.

1022
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:17,740
So you wanted Castro dead.
Everybody wanted Castro dead.

1023
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:22,370
You know, if Hunt
and the others are CIA...

1024
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:26,080
...why don't we just dump this
back in the CIA's lap,

1025
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:30,670
- let Dick Helms take the fall?
- Because...

1026
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:34,420
Because Helms knows too much.

1027
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:38,720
If there's anyone in this country
who knows more than me,

1028
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,430
it's Hoover and Helms, and you
don't fuck with Dick Helms, period.

1029
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:46,810
All right. But why,
if Kennedy was so clean in all this,

1030
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:50,770
- didn't he cancel Track Two?
- 'Cause he didn't even know about it.

1031
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:56,610
The CIA, uh, never told him.
They just kept it going.

1032
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,240
It had a life of its own
like it was some...

1033
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:04,530
...kind of a thing, you know?

1034
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,580
It doesn't even know it exists.

1035
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,540
It just eats people
when it doesn't need 'em anymore.

1036
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:14,170
<i>Two days after the Bay of Pigs,</i>

1037
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:18,550
<i>Kennedy called me
and he reamed me out.</i>

1038
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:22,550
- He just found out about Track Two.
- You never told him?

1039
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:25,470
I didn't want him to get the credit.

1040
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,430
He said I'd stabbed him in the back

1041
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,680
and called me a two-bit
grocery clerk from Whittier.

1042
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,280
That's the last time I ever saw him.

1043
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:52,870
See, when I saw Bobby
lying there on the floor,

1044
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,710
arms stretched out like that,
his eyes staring...

1045
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,090
...I knew then I'd be president.

1046
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:06,760
His death paved the way, didn't it?

1047
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,930
Yeah. Vietnam, the Kennedys

1048
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:13,310
cleared a path
through the wilderness just for me.

1049
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:17,360
Over the bodies.

1050
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,690
Four bodies.

1051
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:30,410
You mean two.

1052
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,750
Two bodies.

1053
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,170
Four.

1054
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:52,970
How many did you have?

1055
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,230
Hundreds of thousands?

1056
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,400
Where would we be without death, huh?

1057
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:06,150
Abe?

1058
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,830
Who's helping us?

1059
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,250
Is it God, or is it...

1060
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,460
...death?

1061
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,430
Harold.

1062
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:19,810
Harold, why don't you sit down, huh?

1063
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:24,070
Here.

1064
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,990
That was a whopper.

1065
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,200
You'll be able to do it now.

1066
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:42,420
- What?
- Go to law school.

1067
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,670
- Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it.
- Harold.

1068
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:49,170
Mama expects great things from you.

1069
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:53,180
Can I... Can I get you anything?

1070
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,890
Relax, Dick.

1071
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,230
It's just me, all right?

1072
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:09,530
The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?

1073
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:17,870
I want to go home, Dick.

1074
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,960
Time to go home.

1075
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:26,880
You... You're not gonna quit
on me now, are you, Harold?

1076
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,380
Richard.

1077
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:21,060
- I can't.
- You must.

1078
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:26,900
This law school,
it's a gift from thy brother.

1079
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:30,230
He had to die for me to get it?

1080
01:17:34,110 --> 01:17:36,860
Something has to come of this.

1081
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:41,490
It's meant to make us stronger.

1082
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:45,370
Thee art stronger than Harold,
stronger than Arthur.

1083
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:51,300
- God has chosen thee to survive.
- What about happiness, Mother?

1084
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:57,550
Thee will find thy peace
at the center, Richard.

1085
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:02,430
Strength in this life,
happiness in the next.

1086
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,980
Now tell me you didn't want this, Buddy.

1087
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,080
Hey!

1088
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:25,970
When the strongest nation
in the world can be tied down

1089
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:30,350
for four years in a war in Vietnam
with no end in sight,

1090
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:34,770
when the richest nation in the world
can't manage its own economy,

1091
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:38,320
when the nation with the greatest
tradition of the rule of law

1092
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,660
is plagued by unprecedented lawlessness,

1093
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:45,870
when a nation that has been known for
a century for equality of opportunity

1094
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:49,460
is torn by unprecedented
racial violence,

1095
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:53,080
when the president of the United States
cannot travel abroad

1096
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:57,630
or to any major city at home without
fear of a hostile demonstration,

1097
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:02,800
then it is time for new leadership
for the United States of America.

1098
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,680
As we look at America, we see cities
enveloped in smoke and flame,

1099
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:12,310
millions of Americans
crying out in anguish,

1100
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:17,820
"Did we come all the way for this?
Did American boys die in Normandy

1101
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,610
and Valley Forge for this?"

1102
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:24,160
I pledge to you
that the current wave of violence

1103
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,330
will not be the wave of the future.

1104
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:32,750
Now let us begin
by committing ourselves to the truth,

1105
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:36,880
to find the truth, to speak the truth
and to live the truth.

1106
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,420
A new voice is being heard
across America today.

1107
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:43,380
It is not the voice
of the protesters or the shouters.

1108
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:47,640
It is the quiet voice of the majority
of Americans who've been forgotten,

1109
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:51,060
the non-shouters,
the, uh, non-demonstrators.

1110
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:56,110
They're the good people. They work hard
and they save and they pay their taxes.

1111
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,610
Now, who are they?
Let me tell you who they are.

1112
01:20:58,690 --> 01:21:00,900
They're in this audience
by the thousands.

1113
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,530
They're the white Americans
and black Americans,

1114
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:06,240
Mexican Americans
and Italian Americans.

1115
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,620
They're the great silent majority,

1116
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:12,120
and they have become angry, finally.
Angry, not with hate,

1117
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,870
but angry, my friends,
because they love America

1118
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:19,170
and they don't like what's happened
to America these last four years.

1119
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:24,550
Let us understand North Vietnam cannot
defeat or humiliate the United States.

1120
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,720
Only Americans can do that!

1121
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,930
I say to you tonight...

1122
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:36,020
I say to you tonight we must have
a new feeling of responsibility,

1123
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:40,400
of self-discipline. We must look
to renew state and local government.

1124
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:45,530
We must have a complete reform
of a big, bloated federal government.

1125
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:47,740
Those of us in public service know

1126
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:50,740
we can have full prosperity
in peacetime.

1127
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:52,950
Yes, we can cut the defense budget.

1128
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,960
We can reduce, uh,
conventional forces in Europe.

1129
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,130
We can restore the natural environment.

1130
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:01,380
We can improve health care,
make it more available to all people.

1131
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:04,970
And yes, we can have a complete reform
of this government.

1132
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:08,390
We can have a new American revolution!

1133
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,940
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

1134
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,000
It'd be a disaster.

1135
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:39,290
There's a lot of sympathy
out there for Cambodia.

1136
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:42,460
Tiny, little, neutral Buddhist country.

1137
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,760
They'll be rioting in the streets,
on your front lawn!

1138
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,340
Building the Cambodian army up? That
would be harder than a Vietnamese Army.

1139
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:55,430
They have no tradition. Mr. President,
the government there will collapse.

1140
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,770
- So you're saying do nothing.
- No, sir, continue the bombing.

1141
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:01,690
The same old horseshit.
Well, that's not good enough.

1142
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:04,320
I'm sick of being pushed around
by the Vietnamese

1143
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:08,360
like we're some, uh,
you know, pitiful giant.

1144
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:11,320
They're using our POWs
to humiliate us.

1145
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:14,240
What we need now
is a bold move into Cambodia

1146
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:17,660
and go right after their
VC base camps

1147
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:21,830
and, uh... make 'em scream,
hit 'em in the ass.

1148
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,210
- What do you think, Henry?
- Well, as you know,

1149
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,720
most of my staff have weighed in
against this incursion.

1150
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:33,720
They believe it will fail to achieve
anything fundamental militarily

1151
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,140
and will result
in crushing criticism domestically.

1152
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:41,060
I didn't ask what your staff thinks.
What do you think, Henry?

1153
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:43,810
What I think is they're cowards.

1154
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:47,440
Their opposition
represents the cowardice

1155
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:51,950
of the eastern establishment.
They don't realize, as you do, sir,

1156
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:54,580
that the Communists
only respect strength

1157
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:57,040
and they will only negotiate
in good faith

1158
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,910
if they fear the mad man, Richard Nixon.

1159
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,710
Exactly!
Unpredictability is our best asset.

1160
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:07,500
We gotta take the war to 'em, hit 'em
where it hurts, right in the nuts.

1161
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:11,880
- More assassinations. Right, Al?
- That's what they're doing.

1162
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:15,680
See, your people in the State
Department, Bill, they don't understand.

1163
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,600
- Mr. President...
- Electrify people with bold moves.

1164
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:23,190
Bold moves make history.
Like, uh... Teddy Roosevelt, TR,

1165
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:27,230
rushing up San Juan Hill.
Small event, but dramatic.

1166
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:30,360
- People took notice.
- They'll take notice, all right.

1167
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:35,450
If we sneak out of this war,
another will start a mile down the road.

1168
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:39,290
We bite the bullet here in Cambodia.
There.

1169
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:42,160
We bomb the hell out of these people.

1170
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:49,550
Tonight, American
and South Vietnamese units

1171
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:51,380
will attack the headquarters

1172
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:55,550
for the entire Communist military
operation in South Vietnam.

1173
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,810
This is not an invasion of Cambodia.

1174
01:24:58,890 --> 01:25:03,980
We take this action not for the purpose
of expanding the war into Cambodia,

1175
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:07,400
but for the purpose
of ending the war in Vietnam.

1176
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:13,860
<i>All across the nation,</i>

1177
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:16,660
<i>major student protests
against the U.S. invasion</i>

1178
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:19,490
<i>of Cambodia rocked college campuses.</i>

1179
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:23,250
<i>At Jackson State, two Negro students
were killed and ten were wounded.</i>

1180
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:26,790
<i>- ...unanimously and united behind...
- In the streets of New York,</i>

1181
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,420
<i>protesters were attacked
by construction workers</i>

1182
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,710
<i>supporting President Nixon's policies.</i>

1183
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:37,340
<i>In Washington, protesters
have barricaded the White House</i>

1184
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:39,470
<i>and are camping out
at the Lincoln Memorial.</i>

1185
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:55,110
See, when I think of those kids
out there in Vietnam doing their duty,

1186
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:58,280
uh, I bet they were scared.
I was when I was there.

1187
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,240
But when it comes down to it,

1188
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:04,450
you really have to look up to these men
because they're the greatest.

1189
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:11,300
I mean, you see these bums, you know,

1190
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:14,880
blowing up the campuses,
burning books and so forth.

1191
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:18,050
And they call themselves
"flower children."

1192
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:21,890
I call them spoiled rotten.
And I tell you what would cure them.

1193
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:26,350
A good, old-fashioned trip to my Ohio
father's woodshed. Right, Julie?

1194
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:29,190
- Right, Dad.
- That's what these bums need.

1195
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:32,400
- Well, thanks and congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

1196
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,490
Yeah. OK. Thanks, everybody. Bye.

1197
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:38,780
The whole world is watching.

1198
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:57,090
<i>Less than 24 hours after
President Nixon called them bums,</i>

1199
01:26:57,090 --> 01:27:00,760
<i>Less than 24 hours after
President Nixon called them bums,</i>

1200
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:04,770
<i>four students were shot dead
at Kent State University in Ohio.</i>

1201
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:07,770
<i>Enraged student groups are calling</i>

1202
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:10,270
<i>for a general strike
tomorrow to shut down...</i>

1203
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:14,570
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.
Now, stop this pussyfooting around.

1204
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:16,190
Jesus Christ, dead kids.

1205
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,280
How the hell did we give the Democrats
a weapon like this?

1206
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,530
Well, one way or the other,
Kent State is not good.

1207
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:25,740
- We have to get out in front of this.
- Follow the money.

1208
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:29,290
- Sir?
- These kids are manipulated

1209
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:32,330
by the Communists,
like Chambers and Hiss.

1210
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:33,920
What's the matter with you?

1211
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,130
- This isn't '48. They'll never buy it.
- How do you know that, John?

1212
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:40,130
What's Hoover found,
for God's sake?

1213
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:44,510
He called the other day, sir.
He asked for President Harding.

1214
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:48,810
- We can have a national prayer day.
- Never complain, never explain.

1215
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:52,850
Come on, these
are not fraternity pranks, John.

1216
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:55,110
No, this is anarchy.
It's a revolution.

1217
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:58,190
- I wouldn't go that far, sir.
- Why not?

1218
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:03,700
Well, is it worth it, sir? I mean,
is the war worth a one-term presidency?

1219
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:06,160
Right now I think
that's what we're looking at.

1220
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,450
I will not go down as the first
American president to lose a war.

1221
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:12,500
Going to Cambodia, bombing Hanoi,
bombing Laos buys us time

1222
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:15,420
so we can get out and give
the South Vietnamese a chance.

1223
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:19,340
- Exactly, sir.
- If we keep our heads, we'll win this.

1224
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,930
- What, win Vietnam, sir?
- No, no.

1225
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,180
No, but we can drive a stake through
the heart of the Communist alliance.

1226
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:30,480
Henry's getting strong signals
from the Chinese.

1227
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,150
They fear the Vietnamese
more than the Russians

1228
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:36,150
and they're worried
about a united Vietnam.

1229
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:39,400
Now, if we stick it out,
we'll end up negotiating separately

1230
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,200
with both the Chinese and the Soviets.

1231
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:45,530
And we'll get better deals
than we ever dreamed of from both.

1232
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:51,120
- That is triangular diplomacy.
- Exactly, Mr. President.

1233
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,210
That's what geopolitics is about.

1234
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:57,880
The linking of the whole world
for self-interest.

1235
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,800
You tell me, Ron,
how the hell I can explain that on TV

1236
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,130
to a bunch of simpleminded reporters
and, uh, weeping mothers.

1237
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,010
But what am I telling the press

1238
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,640
- about Kent State?
- Tell 'em what the hell you like.

1239
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,850
- They don't understand anyway.
- Excuse me, sir.

1240
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:16,060
Are you saying you're
gonna recognize Red China?

1241
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:18,860
That would cost us
our strongest support.

1242
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:21,740
No, I can do this because
I spent my whole career

1243
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:25,570
- building anti-Communist credentials.
- If Kennedy or Johnson tried it,

1244
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:28,120
they'd have crucified them,
and rightfully so.

1245
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:32,290
Damned risky, Mr. President.
Why don't we wait until the second term?

1246
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:35,580
- This will get us a second term.
- This will get me a second term.

1247
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:39,460
Damn it, without risk, there's
no heroism, there's no history.

1248
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,260
Nixon was born to do this.
Give history a nudge.

1249
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,880
- Come on!
- Hear, hear.

1250
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:48,180
If Cambodia doesn't work,
we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.

1251
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:51,810
That's right.
And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.

1252
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,230
We have to entertain the possibility.

1253
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:06,400
Goddamn it! Who cooked this damn steak?

1254
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:09,320
Manolo, there's blood all over my plate.
Take it away.

1255
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:11,030
I'm sorry, sir.

1256
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,590
You all right?

1257
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,220
Yeah.

1258
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:33,600
My brother, Harold,
was the same age as those kids, John.

1259
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:38,150
- Tuberculosis got him.
- It wasn't your fault.

1260
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:42,150
The soldiers were kids too.
They just panicked.

1261
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:43,400
Yeah.

1262
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:48,160
They were throwing rocks,
John, just rocks.

1263
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:53,080
They don't think I feel,

1264
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:56,160
but I feel too much sometimes.

1265
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:01,210
I just can't let a whole policy
be dominated by our sentimentality.

1266
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:05,170
You're doing the right thing.
Don't let 'em shake you.

1267
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:10,430
You know, it broke my heart
when Harold died.

1268
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:13,310
That was a long time ago.

1269
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,310
Yeah.

1270
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:19,520
I think that's when it starts,
when you're a kid.

1271
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,440
The laughs and snubs
and slights you get

1272
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,860
because you're poor or Irish

1273
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:30,530
or Jewish or just ugly.

1274
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:35,120
Get off that. That leads nowhere.

1275
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:40,330
But you should offer condolences
to the families of those kids.

1276
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:41,790
Sure.

1277
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:46,880
I'd like to.
I'd like to offer my condolences.

1278
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,760
But Nixon can't.

1279
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:09,240
<i>Enraged student groups
across the country</i>

1280
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,400
<i>are calling for
a general strike tomorrow</i>

1281
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:15,870
<i>to shut down the entire university
system until the Vietnam War is ended.</i>

1282
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:18,540
Oh, this is nothing
compared to Venezuela.

1283
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:22,500
When I was vice president, Ike sent me
down there like a blocking tackle.

1284
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:25,500
They threw rocks, broke out windows.

1285
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:28,670
<i>Almost overturned the car.
Read Six Crises, Bob.</i>

1286
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,130
- I did, sir.
- Pat was brave.

1287
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:39,430
Jesus, they're serious.
Why are we stopping? Come on, move it!

1288
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:47,940
- Jesus!
- Get that little punk!

1289
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:49,900
Tackle! Go on, get him!

1290
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:51,110
Yeah!

1291
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:56,870
Yeah. Reminds me
of my days at Whittier.

1292
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:59,620
- These kids are useless.
- Probably flunking.

1293
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,410
Nothing to do except come here
and chase girls.

1294
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:06,960
Their parents' fault.
They're poisoning the upper class, Bob.

1295
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,630
- Too soft, too many cars, color TVs.
- Don't forget the South, the West.

1296
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:13,430
Good football colleges.
More with than against you.

1297
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:17,050
Let's not forget they're just kids.
They don't vote.

1298
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:19,850
This is the fall of the Roman Empire.
Are you blind?

1299
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:22,310
We're putting the fig leaves
on the statues.

1300
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:35,070
Mr. President.

1301
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,700
- Bob.
- I don't know what to say, sir.

1302
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:41,080
Soon as we learned from the Secret
Service that you were en route,

1303
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,580
the director was notified.
He should be here.

1304
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:47,960
- So where the hell is he?
- Rushing back from his tennis game.

1305
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:50,920
- So let's go.
- Told me to take you

1306
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,210
- to his conference room.
- No, his office.

1307
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:56,590
I want a private conversation with him.
I don't wanna be bugged.

1308
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,470
- Then his office will be fine.
- OK.

1309
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:08,690
All right.

1310
01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:14,280
- How's the job going, Bob?
- Frankly, it stinks, sir.

1311
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:16,280
I have no access.

1312
01:34:17,570 --> 01:34:21,240
- We'll see to that.
- He's nervous, sir.

1313
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:24,160
He's heard you're looking
for a new director.

1314
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:27,710
- Certainly isn't acting like it.
- That's Helms.

1315
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:32,710
He's the epitome of sang-froid.
A world-class poker player.

1316
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,510
Yeah? Well, I own the fucking casino.

1317
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:46,430
I'm honored, Dick,
that you've come all the way out here

1318
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,150
to Virginia to visit us at last.

1319
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,530
- My friends call me Mr. President.
- Then so shall I.

1320
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:57,990
- Mr. Helms.
- Arrange for some coffee,

1321
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,910
will you, General Cushman?

1322
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:03,870
Gentleman, please.

1323
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:14,840
Bob Cushman is a lieutenant general
in the Marine Corps,

1324
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:18,590
deputy director of the CIA.

1325
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:23,220
- This is what you use him for?
- I didn't choose him as my deputy.

1326
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:28,020
- You did.
- You live pretty well out here.

1327
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:31,600
I understand why you keep
your budgets classified.

1328
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:35,780
I suppose you're unhappy...

1329
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:41,700
...because I haven't implemented
your domestic intelligence plan.

1330
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:43,370
Yeah, you're correct.

1331
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:46,950
I'm concerned these students
are being funded by foreign interests

1332
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:50,960
whether they know it or not.
The FBI's useless in this area.

1333
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,460
I want your full attention
on this matter.

1334
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:56,250
We've tried, but so far
we've come up with nothing.

1335
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:59,420
Then find something!
I want these leaks stopped.

1336
01:35:59,510 --> 01:36:03,300
Jack Anderson, The New York Times,
the State Department.

1337
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:06,390
- I wanna know who's talking.
- I'm sure you realize

1338
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:08,730
that this is a tricky area,

1339
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:12,440
given our charter and
the Congressional oversight committee.

1340
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:16,320
Screw congressional oversight.
I know damn well, going back to the '50s

1341
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:20,200
this agency reports what it wants
and buries what it wants.

1342
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:25,280
- Pay close attention to this.
- Is something else bothering you?

1343
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:26,950
Yes.

1344
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,660
It involves some old
and forgotten papers...

1345
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:33,080
...things I signed as vice president.

1346
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:38,300
I want the original in my office
and I don't want copies anywhere else.

1347
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:42,180
You're referring, I believe,

1348
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:45,600
to chairing
the special operations group

1349
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,520
- as vice president.
- Yeah.

1350
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:52,640
As you know, that was unique.

1351
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:59,150
Not an operation so much
as an organic phenomenon.

1352
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:03,570
It grew, it changed shape,

1353
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:07,370
it developed appetites.

1354
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:13,670
It's not unusual in such cases
that things aren't committed to paper.

1355
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:16,580
That could be very embarrassing.

1356
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:22,340
I, for one, saw to it that my name was
never connected with these operations.

1357
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:24,380
Diem.

1358
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:30,010
Trujillo.

1359
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:31,390
Lumumba.

1360
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:32,680
Guatemala.

1361
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:37,190
Iran.

1362
01:37:37,730 --> 01:37:38,860
Cuba.

1363
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:51,450
It's a shame you didn't
take similar precautions, Dick.

1364
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,960
I'm interested in those documents
that put your people together

1365
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:03,510
with the gangster elements.

1366
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:07,890
- All the documents.
- President Kennedy threatened

1367
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:11,220
to smash the CIA into 1,000 pieces.

1368
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:13,350
You could do the same.

1369
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,600
I'm not Jack Kennedy. Uh...

1370
01:38:17,690 --> 01:38:22,480
- Your agency is secure.
- Not if I give you all the cards.

1371
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:32,700
I promised the American people
peace with honor in Southeast Asia.

1372
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:38,290
That may take time.
Two, maybe three years.

1373
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:42,000
But, in the meantime,
your agency will continue

1374
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:44,550
at current levels of funding.

1375
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:49,140
Current levels may not be sufficient.

1376
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:54,140
Well, the president will support
a reasonable request for an increase.

1377
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:55,930
And me?

1378
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,860
Of course,
you will continue as DCI, Dick.

1379
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,860
You're doing a magnificent job.

1380
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:08,780
Of course, I accept. I'm flattered.

1381
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:15,240
And I want you to know that
I serve only one president at a time.

1382
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:20,420
Yes. And you'll give
General Cushman full access.

1383
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:26,920
It could take a little time.

1384
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:29,720
But I'll order a search
for your papers.

1385
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,640
- Good.
- It does raise...

1386
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:35,930
- ...a troubling issue.
- What?

1387
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:38,350
Castro.

1388
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:43,400
- Yes?
- We have recent intelligence

1389
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:46,480
that a Soviet nuclear submarine

1390
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:51,990
- has docked at Cienfuegos.
- We'll launch a formal protest.

1391
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:56,290
I don't think we can treat this
as a formality.

1392
01:39:57,830 --> 01:40:02,880
Mr. Kennedy gave the Russians a verbal
promise that he would not invade Cuba.

1393
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:07,000
But you authorized Dr. Kissinger
to put this in writing?

1394
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:14,220
- Are you tapping Kissinger?
- My job, unpleasant at times,

1395
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:16,640
is to know what others
don't want me to know.

1396
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:20,180
Not if you have spies
in the White House.

1397
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:23,400
It is not my practice
to spy on the president.

1398
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:27,190
Dr. Kissinger manages to convey his
innermost secrets to the world

1399
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,110
without my help.

1400
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,240
Dick...

1401
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:36,030
We've lived with communism in Cuba
for ten years.

1402
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:39,750
But it's never been the policy
of this government to accept that.

1403
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:44,080
- And it's certainly not CIA policy.
- CIA policy?

1404
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:48,380
The CIA has no policy
except what I dictate to you.

1405
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:55,550
I tried to, uh, adjust to the world
as it is today,

1406
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:59,220
not as you or I wanted it
to be ten years ago.

1407
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:03,020
Is that why you and Kissinger
are negotiating with the Chinese?

1408
01:41:04,350 --> 01:41:08,480
This is a very dangerous direction,
Mr. President.

1409
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:12,740
Terrible consequences can result
from such enormous errors of judgment.

1410
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:18,620
If we were able to separate
China from Russia once and for all,

1411
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:21,250
we can, we could create
a balance of power

1412
01:41:21,330 --> 01:41:23,960
that would secure peace
into the next century.

1413
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:27,460
And offer Cuba to the Russians
as a consolation prize?

1414
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:35,300
- Cuba would be a small price to pay.
- So President Kennedy thought.

1415
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:44,230
I never thought Kennedy
was ready for the presidency.

1416
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:50,650
Well, now...

1417
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:53,400
...I would never, uh...

1418
01:41:53,490 --> 01:41:56,200
...never consider...

1419
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:59,830
His death was awful.

1420
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:03,410
It was an awful thing
for this country.

1421
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:07,080
Yeah.

1422
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:12,340
Do you ever think of death, Dick?

1423
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,640
Flowers are a continual reminder
of our mortality.

1424
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:21,760
- Do you appreciate flowers?
- No.

1425
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:26,640
No, they make me sick
and they smell like death.

1426
01:42:28,770 --> 01:42:31,110
I had two brothers die young.

1427
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:34,900
Let me tell you,

1428
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:37,530
there are worse things than death.

1429
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:39,070
Yes.

1430
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:44,830
There's such a thing as evil.

1431
01:42:47,290 --> 01:42:51,710
You must be familiar
with my favorite poem by Yeats,

1432
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:53,800
<i>The Second Coming.</i>

1433
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:58,890
Black Irish, very moving.

1434
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:06,230
Turning and turning
in the widening gyre

1435
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:10,400
The falcon cannot hear the falconer

1436
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,480
Things fall apart

1437
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:17,360
The center cannot hold

1438
01:43:17,450 --> 01:43:21,820
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world

1439
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:26,950
And everywhere, the ceremony
of innocence is lost

1440
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:31,290
The best lack all conviction

1441
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:37,340
And the worst are full
of passionate intensity

1442
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,680
But it ends so beautifully ominous.

1443
01:43:44,390 --> 01:43:47,270
What rough beast

1444
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:51,310
Its hour come round at last

1445
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:56,400
Slouches toward Bethlehem
to be born?

1446
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:00,280
Yes.

1447
01:44:01,530 --> 01:44:05,160
This country stands at such a juncture.

1448
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,210
Manolo?

1449
01:44:16,210 --> 01:44:17,630
Mano?

1450
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:20,420
- Mr. President.
- Yeah.

1451
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:23,970
I'm sorry. I was asleep.

1452
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:26,970
What can I get you?

1453
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:31,060
- Well, you know.
- Of course.

1454
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:48,330
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?

1455
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:51,410
Yes, Mr. President.

1456
01:44:56,590 --> 01:45:01,010
We let you down, didn't we?
Your people.

1457
01:45:01,090 --> 01:45:04,140
That was Mr. Kennedy, sir.

1458
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:13,350
You don't think he was a hero, do you?

1459
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:18,270
He was a politician.

1460
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:30,240
Did you cry when he died?

1461
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,000
Yes, sir.

1462
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:38,960
Why?

1463
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:42,720
I don't know.

1464
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:47,640
He made me...

1465
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:50,310
...see the stars.

1466
01:45:57,190 --> 01:45:59,480
How did he do that?

1467
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:03,530
Those kids.

1468
01:46:05,530 --> 01:46:09,080
Why do they hate me so much?

1469
01:47:47,510 --> 01:47:50,510
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.

1470
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:52,300
Hi, there.

1471
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:56,020
- Where you from?
- Syracuse.

1472
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:59,480
Oh, yeah, the, uh, Orangemen.

1473
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:02,150
Now, there's a football program.

1474
01:48:02,230 --> 01:48:06,440
Jim Brown and that other tailback,

1475
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:09,650
- the one with the blood disease.
- Ernie Davis.

1476
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:11,740
Yeah, right, right, right.

1477
01:48:11,990 --> 01:48:15,700
I used to play a little ball myself
at Whittier.

1478
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:20,870
Of course, they used
to use me as a tackling dummy.

1479
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,420
We didn't come here
to talk about football.

1480
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,670
Yeah, I understand that.

1481
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:32,640
- How old are you, young lady?
- Nineteen.

1482
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:34,640
Yeah.

1483
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:40,230
Well, probably most of you think
I'm a real SOB. I know that.

1484
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:42,900
I understand how you feel.
But, you know,

1485
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:45,690
I want peace too.
But peace with honor.

1486
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:48,070
- What does that mean?
- Bullshit.

1487
01:48:48,150 --> 01:48:51,740
Well, you can't have peace
without a price.

1488
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:55,490
Sometimes you have to be
willing to fight for peace,

1489
01:48:55,570 --> 01:48:57,580
and sometimes to die.

1490
01:48:57,660 --> 01:49:01,410
Yeah? Tell that to the GIs who are
gonna die tomorrow in Vietnam.

1491
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:05,080
- What lets you kill women and children?
- What you have to understand

1492
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:08,090
is we're willing to die
for what we believe in.

1493
01:49:08,170 --> 01:49:10,170
- That's the truth.
- Yeah.

1494
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:11,670
Yeah.

1495
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:17,600
Look, that man up there,
he lived in similar times.

1496
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:22,020
Oh, he had chaos, civil war,
hatred between the races.

1497
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:26,440
- This is all bullshit.
- Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room

1498
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:29,980
at the White House and just pray.
But, you know,

1499
01:49:30,070 --> 01:49:34,280
liberals act like idealism
belongs to them.

1500
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,780
That's not true.

1501
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:42,710
My family went Republican
because Lincoln freed the slaves.

1502
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:45,000
My grandmother was an abolitionist.

1503
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:49,210
It was Quakers who founded Whittier,
my hometown...

1504
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:52,130
- Address the issues.
- ...to abolish slavery.

1505
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:55,300
They were, you know,
conservative Bible folk,

1506
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:59,350
but they had a powerful sense
of right and wrong.

1507
01:49:59,430 --> 01:50:02,810
Forty years ago,
I was like you.

1508
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:07,480
- Looking for answers. See?
- Come on.

1509
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,480
Tricky Dick himself.

1510
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:15,780
My mother used to feed hobos
stopping over at our house.

1511
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:17,320
We got him.

1512
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:19,120
- Don't push, pig.
- Move away.

1513
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:22,450
It's OK, Bob, we're just rapping,
my friends and I.

1514
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:25,250
In fact, we agree on a lot of things,
don't we?

1515
01:50:25,330 --> 01:50:28,670
No, we don't.
You say you want to end the war,

1516
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:34,380
- so why don't you?
- Change always comes slowly.

1517
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:37,510
I pulled out more than half the troops.

1518
01:50:37,590 --> 01:50:41,140
I'm trying to cut the military budget
for the first time in 30 years.

1519
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:43,180
I want a volunteer army.

1520
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:46,140
But it's also a question
of American credibility.

1521
01:50:46,230 --> 01:50:48,980
- Our position in the world.
- Come on, Mr. Nixon.

1522
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:53,730
- It's a civil war between Vietnamese.
- You don't want the war.

1523
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:57,360
We don't want the war.
The Vietnamese don't want the war.

1524
01:50:57,450 --> 01:50:59,450
So why does it go on?

1525
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:07,250
- You should be going, Mr. President.
- OK.

1526
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,250
Please.

1527
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:14,550
You can't stop it, can you?

1528
01:51:15,510 --> 01:51:17,170
Even if you wanted to.

1529
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:21,010
'Cause it's not you, it's the system.

1530
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:24,100
The system won't let you stop it.

1531
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:30,560
There's... There's more at stake here

1532
01:51:30,650 --> 01:51:33,230
than what you want or what I want.

1533
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:34,730
Then what's the point?

1534
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:38,400
What's the point of being president?
You're powerless!

1535
01:51:38,490 --> 01:51:41,820
No! No, I'm not powerless.

1536
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:44,740
Because I understand the system,
I believe I can...

1537
01:51:44,830 --> 01:51:48,210
I can control it,
maybe not control it totally,

1538
01:51:48,290 --> 01:51:51,040
but tame it enough
to make it do some good.

1539
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:55,090
Sounds like you're talking
about a wild animal.

1540
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:00,550
Yeah, maybe I am.

1541
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:03,220
We really must go,
Mr. President. Please.

1542
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:07,350
- Hey, what about the war, man?
- When you gonna get us out?

1543
01:52:07,430 --> 01:52:10,440
- The old man's moving.
- Move it. Get away.

1544
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:13,190
She got it, Bob.
Nineteen-year-old college kid.

1545
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:15,610
- What? Who?
- She understood something

1546
01:52:15,690 --> 01:52:18,610
that's taken me 25 years
in politics to understand.

1547
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:22,360
The CIA, the Mafia,
those Wall Street bastards.

1548
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:24,620
- Sir?
- The beast.

1549
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:28,120
Nineteen-year-old kid.
She called it a wild animal.

1550
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:29,710
Yes, sir.

1551
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:57,480
<i>In Washington, the size
of the crowds have swelled to over</i>

1552
01:52:57,570 --> 01:53:01,650
<i>a quarter of a million demonstrators
protesting the ongoing war in Vietnam.</i>

1553
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:04,490
There must be
a quarter million out there.

1554
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:08,410
They've been at it for a whole year.
Young kids just like Tricia.

1555
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:13,290
You think they got a point, Edgar?

1556
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:19,090
- This whole damn system of government.
- Remember what Lenin said in 1917.

1557
01:53:19,170 --> 01:53:21,550
The power was lying in the street.

1558
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:24,300
Just waiting for someone to pick it up.

1559
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:26,680
Communists have never
been closer than now.

1560
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:30,020
Now is the time to get back
to the old themes.

1561
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:32,850
The ones that made you president.

1562
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:35,350
Let the communists
know you're on to them.

1563
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:38,650
Little bastards think they can
ruin Tricia's wedding

1564
01:53:38,730 --> 01:53:41,190
by dancing naked in the reflection pool.

1565
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:44,200
Don't listen to 'em.
And don't quit.

1566
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:48,450
Remember, Kennedy and King
were against the war.

1567
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:50,330
Where are they now?

1568
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:55,920
How the hell The Times got a hold of
this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace.

1569
01:53:57,750 --> 01:54:00,460
Yeah. We can't keep a damn secret
in this government.

1570
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:03,380
They're stealing papers
right out of this office.

1571
01:54:03,470 --> 01:54:05,590
Johnson had the same damn problem

1572
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,720
- until he bugged his own office.
- We took that system out.

1573
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,270
That was a mistake.

1574
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:14,480
The White House was full
of Kennedy people then.

1575
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:17,520
- It still is.
- Who's behind this?

1576
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:21,940
Well, you have CIA people
all over this place.

1577
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:26,410
Helms has seen to that.
Then there's Kissinger's staff.

1578
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:30,580
Kissinger himself, I believe,
may be the leaker.

1579
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:32,240
- Kissinger?
- Hmm.

1580
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:35,080
He's obsessed with his own image.

1581
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:38,420
He wants his Nobel Peace Prize
a little too much.

1582
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:41,250
And as the late Dr. King proved,

1583
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:44,630
even an ape can win a prize
with good press.

1584
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:47,760
Jesus, I'd like to book him
into a psychiatrist's office.

1585
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:51,600
He comes in here ranting and raving,
dumping his crap all over the place.

1586
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:56,940
- Could you prove it, Edgar?
- Mr. President,

1587
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:59,020
I always get my man.

1588
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:01,940
Yeah, you do.

1589
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:05,320
This damn tie. Could you help me?

1590
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:06,820
Yeah.

1591
01:55:10,530 --> 01:55:13,700
- See, I'd be bugging myself.
- Look.

1592
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:19,630
- Who'd get the tapes?
- No one. Your property.

1593
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:22,790
And it would prove your case.

1594
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,670
Why do you think Kissinger
is taping all your calls?

1595
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,680
For history.

1596
01:55:30,970 --> 01:55:32,800
His word against yours.

1597
01:55:32,890 --> 01:55:36,310
And right now, he's got the records.

1598
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:43,070
I'll get Manolo to do this.

1599
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:45,780
Thanks.

1600
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:47,990
You know, Churchill once said to me,

1601
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:50,490
"If you want your own
history written properly,

1602
01:55:50,570 --> 01:55:52,570
you better write it yourself."

1603
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:54,790
The only thing is, Edgar,

1604
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:57,250
I don't want this to come back
and haunt me.

1605
01:55:57,330 --> 01:56:00,210
It won't, as long as I'm here.

1606
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:02,380
Good.

1607
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:10,680
This way.

1608
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:17,810
What's wrong?

1609
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:21,270
We're just not going
to buckle to these people.

1610
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:23,440
No more war!

1611
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:32,450
- It's beautiful.
- OK.

1612
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:38,540
Yes, thank you.

1613
01:56:48,130 --> 01:56:50,970
Princess, may I?

1614
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:53,800
Thank you.

1615
01:57:06,820 --> 01:57:10,400
I'm very proud of you today,
Princess. Very.

1616
01:57:10,490 --> 01:57:11,820
Thank you, Daddy.

1617
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:29,340
Yeah?

1618
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:33,430
Some very secret essays on Vietnam have
been leaked to The New York Times.

1619
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:35,760
I know, I know. Not now, Chuck.

1620
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:44,440
<i>- The New York Times.
- Get Ron over here.</i>

1621
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:51,530
It's the happiest day of my life.

1622
01:57:57,370 --> 01:58:01,160
<i>The New York Times began
publishing the first in a series</i>

1623
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:06,790
<i>of 47 volumes of top-secret Pentagon
tapes relating to the war in Vietnam.</i>

1624
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:10,250
<i>The papers, leaked by defense analyst
Daniel Ellsberg,</i>

1625
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:15,130
<i>reveal a pattern of government lies
and American involvement in the war.</i>

1626
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:18,300
Mr. President,
we are in a revolutionary situation.

1627
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:22,060
We are under siege.
The Black Panthers, the Weathermen.

1628
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:25,270
The State Department under Rogers
is leaking like a sieve.

1629
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:28,810
And now this little,
insignificant little shit, Ellsberg,

1630
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:31,730
publishing all the diplomatic secrets
of this country

1631
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:34,780
is destroying our ability
to conduct foreign policy.

1632
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:37,610
I wonder if people here wouldn't
think ten years in prison

1633
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:40,240
was cheap if they could contribute
to ending this war.

1634
01:58:40,330 --> 01:58:45,870
The man has become a drug fiend. He
shot people from helicopters in Vietnam.

1635
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:49,750
He's had sexual relations with his wife
in front of their children.

1636
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,260
He sees a shrink in LA.
The man's all fucked up.

1637
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:56,090
And now he's trying
to look good for the liberals.

1638
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:59,180
And if he gets away with it,
everybody will follow his lead.

1639
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:03,100
- This man must be stopped at all costs.
- I'm as frustrated as you are, Henry,

1640
01:59:03,180 --> 01:59:06,770
but don't you think this is a Democrat
problem? They started the war.

1641
01:59:06,850 --> 01:59:10,900
- It makes them look bad.
- But, Mr. President, the Russians,

1642
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:13,900
the Vietnamese...
it makes you look like a weakling!

1643
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:17,360
Goddamn it. How long have we had
this jackass dog? Two years?

1644
01:59:17,450 --> 01:59:20,700
Still doesn't come. We need a dog
that looks happy when the press is here.

1645
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:23,370
- He's photogenic. Try new biscuits.
- Ah, fuck it.

1646
01:59:23,450 --> 01:59:26,000
He doesn't like me, John.
It's your fault, Henry.

1647
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:29,790
- I beg your pardon?
- It's your people talking to the press.

1648
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:33,250
This Ellsberg, wasn't he
a student of yours at Harvard?

1649
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:36,550
I mean, he's your idea, Henry.
So why are you running for cover?

1650
01:59:36,630 --> 01:59:38,720
Yes, we taught
a class together at Harvard,

1651
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:42,010
but you know these back-stabbing
Ivy League intellectuals.

1652
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:45,930
<i>- No, I don't, Henry.
- Prosecute The New York Times.</i>

1653
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:49,140
- Go for injunction.
- Yeah, but it's not, bottom line,

1654
01:59:49,230 --> 01:59:51,150
gonna change a goddamn thing, John.

1655
01:59:51,230 --> 01:59:54,940
The... question is how do we
screw Ellsberg so bad,

1656
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:57,400
it puts the fear of God
into all leakers?

1657
01:59:57,490 --> 02:00:00,820
The other issue is how the hell
we stop these leaks once and for all?

1658
02:00:00,910 --> 02:00:04,700
Now, someone is talking to the press.
We gotta stop these leaks at any cost.

1659
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:07,250
You hear me?
Then we can go for the big pick:

1660
02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:09,330
- China, Russia.
- Sir, if I might?

1661
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:12,920
- Go, Chuck.
- We can do this ourselves.

1662
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,500
The CIA and the FBI
aren't doing the job.

1663
02:00:15,590 --> 02:00:20,130
Now, we can create our own intelligence
unit right here inside the White House.

1664
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:27,640
- Well, why not?
- Our own intelligence plugs the leaks?

1665
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:31,270
- Yeah. Like plumbers.
- Plumbers.

1666
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:37,190
I like it. I like the idea.

1667
02:00:38,190 --> 02:00:41,490
Yeah, but is it legal?
Has it ever been done before?

1668
02:00:42,610 --> 02:00:44,200
Oh, sure.

1669
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:47,830
Lyndon, JFK, FDR.

1670
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:53,540
I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my
investigation of the Hiss case in '48.

1671
02:00:53,630 --> 02:00:56,460
- What he did was illegal.
- With this kind of thing,

1672
02:00:56,540 --> 02:01:00,340
you got to be brutal. A leak happens,
the whole damn place should be fired.

1673
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:03,800
Really, I mean, you do it
like the Germans in World War II.

1674
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:06,810
They went through these towns,
and a sniper hit one of 'em,

1675
02:01:06,890 --> 02:01:09,220
they'd line the whole
goddamn town up and say,

1676
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:11,480
"Until you talk,
you're all getting shot."

1677
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:14,020
Really, I think that's
what has to be done.

1678
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:16,980
I don't think you
can be Mr. Nice Guy anymore.

1679
02:01:17,070 --> 02:01:20,360
You just whisper the word to me,
and I'll shoot Ellsberg myself.

1680
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:24,990
- We're not Germans.
- Yeah. Ellsberg's not the issue.

1681
02:01:25,070 --> 02:01:28,330
The Pentagon Papers aren't the issue.

1682
02:01:28,410 --> 02:01:31,370
It's the lie.

1683
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:34,670
<i>- Mr. Hiss is lying.
- Yeah.</i>

1684
02:01:35,790 --> 02:01:37,590
Remember, John, back in '48?

1685
02:01:37,670 --> 02:01:40,510
Nobody believed Alger Hiss
was a communist except me.

1686
02:01:40,590 --> 02:01:43,760
They loved Hiss like they
love this Ellsberg character.

1687
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:46,590
He was their kind:
Ivy League establishment.

1688
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:50,430
<i>- l am not, and never have been...
- Mr. Hiss is lying.</i>

1689
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:53,690
<i>- Mr. Hiss?
- I was dirt to them, nothing.</i>

1690
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:57,610
- And Dick kicked the shit out of 'em.
- I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied

1691
02:01:57,690 --> 02:02:01,150
about knowing Chambers. The
documents were old and out of date,

1692
02:02:01,230 --> 02:02:03,780
just like these Pentagon Papers.

1693
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:07,030
The key thing we proved
was that Hiss was a liar.

1694
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:09,870
Then people bought that he was a spy.

1695
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:11,750
It's the lie that gets you.

1696
02:02:13,290 --> 02:02:15,870
All right, Henry,
we're gonna go your way.

1697
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:18,210
Crush this Ellsberg
same way we did Hiss.

1698
02:02:18,290 --> 02:02:20,130
There is no other choice,
Mr. President.

1699
02:02:20,210 --> 02:02:23,760
We'll hit him so hard, he'll look
like everything that's sick and evil

1700
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,760
about the eastern establishment.
You and your plumbers,

1701
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:28,430
you get all the dirt
on this guy.

1702
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:31,220
See him going to the bathroom
in front of the public.

1703
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:33,810
And when we finish with him,
they'll crucify him.

1704
02:02:33,890 --> 02:02:35,810
Then we'll get our second term.

1705
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:53,330
The claws are out, Frank.

1706
02:02:54,870 --> 02:02:57,750
- You seen the guys?
- They're around.

1707
02:02:57,830 --> 02:02:59,830
Why? You got a customer?

1708
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:06,010
- The White House.
- You're fuckin' me.

1709
02:03:06,090 --> 02:03:09,300
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.
We're gonna plug leaks.

1710
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:13,470
- Who are we workin' for?
- A guy named Gordon Liddy.

1711
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:16,770
He thinks he's Martin Bormann.
He wants to meet you.

1712
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:22,980
- Gordon Liddy, Frank Sturgis.
- Hey, Frank.

1713
02:03:28,490 --> 02:03:32,240
Did you see the look on
Hoover's face? He's redder than a beet.

1714
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:34,490
That little closet fairy's
got no choice.

1715
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:37,620
He hates McGovern and Kennedy
so much, he's gotta love me.

1716
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:41,290
- And Lyndon?
- He looked old, didn't he?

1717
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:44,800
<i>- Have you talked to Lyndon?
- I asked, "Lyndon, what would you do</i>

1718
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:48,970
on a scale of one to ten?" He said,
"Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy.

1719
02:03:49,050 --> 02:03:51,140
Bomb them where they live."

1720
02:03:51,220 --> 02:03:56,180
Yeah. Bob, tell Trini I'll be
in Key Biscayne at 4:00.

1721
02:03:56,270 --> 02:03:58,730
<i>- With Pat?
- No, alone.</i>

1722
02:03:58,810 --> 02:04:01,310
Pat's staying here with Mrs. Eisenhower.

1723
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:03,570
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Good.</i>

1724
02:04:05,730 --> 02:04:08,820
Hi, Buddy. What are you doing here?

1725
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:10,360
I missed you.

1726
02:04:11,990 --> 02:04:14,660
Why don't we go down
to Key Biscayne together?

1727
02:04:14,740 --> 02:04:17,950
Because I have to relax.

1728
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:26,500
You know, I was just thinking tonight.

1729
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:31,550
Remember when you used to drive me
on dates with other boys?

1730
02:04:31,630 --> 02:04:35,310
- Yeah.
- Didn't let me out of your sight.

1731
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:38,850
Yeah. Sure.

1732
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:42,600
It was a long time ago.

1733
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:47,610
Yes, it's been a long time.

1734
02:04:52,990 --> 02:04:54,780
Now, look, Buddy.

1735
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:59,080
I don't need that.

1736
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,340
I'm not Jack Kennedy.

1737
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:13,890
No, you're not.

1738
02:05:13,970 --> 02:05:18,970
So stop comparing yourself to him.
You have no reason to.

1739
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:25,810
You have everything you ever wanted.
You earned it.

1740
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:31,150
- Why can't you just enjoy it?
- I do.

1741
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:36,950
- I do in my own way.
- Then what are you scared of, honey?

1742
02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:42,330
I'm not scared, Buddy.
You don't understand.

1743
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:48,500
They're playing for keeps, Buddy.

1744
02:05:48,590 --> 02:05:51,970
You know, the press, the kids,
the liberals out there.

1745
02:05:52,050 --> 02:05:55,010
They're out there trying
to figure out how to tear me down.

1746
02:05:55,090 --> 02:05:58,430
- They're all your enemies?
- Yes.

1747
02:05:58,510 --> 02:06:03,640
- You, personally?
- Yes!

1748
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:10,190
Listen, this is about me.
Why can't you understand that?

1749
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:12,360
I mean, you of all people.

1750
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:16,740
It's not the war. It's Nixon!

1751
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:21,330
It's not Vietnam, it's Nixon.
They want to destroy Nixon.

1752
02:06:21,410 --> 02:06:25,960
If I expose myself just the slightest
bit, they'll tear my insides out.

1753
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:29,790
You want that? You know?
You want to see that, Buddy?

1754
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:31,420
It's not pretty!

1755
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:35,590
Sometimes I think that's
what you want, Dick.

1756
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:37,890
What the hell are you saying?

1757
02:06:39,510 --> 02:06:41,140
Are you drunk?

1758
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:45,100
Jesus, you sound just like them now.

1759
02:06:47,230 --> 02:06:49,690
I gotta keep fighting, Buddy,
for the country.

1760
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:53,150
These people running things, the elite!

1761
02:06:53,230 --> 02:06:56,240
They're just soft, chicken-shit faggots.

1762
02:06:57,740 --> 02:07:00,120
They don't have
the long-term vision anymore.

1763
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:04,040
They just want to cover their ass and
meet girls and tear each other down.

1764
02:07:04,120 --> 02:07:07,920
Oh, God, this country's in deep,
deep, deep trouble, Buddy.

1765
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,500
I have to see this through, you know.

1766
02:07:10,590 --> 02:07:13,340
Mother would have expected
no less of me.

1767
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:18,130
I'm sorry, Buddy.

1768
02:07:20,890 --> 02:07:24,020
I just wish you knew
how much I love you, that's all.

1769
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:29,270
It took me a long time to fall
in love with you, Dick, but I did.

1770
02:07:30,150 --> 02:07:32,860
And it doesn't make you happy.

1771
02:07:32,940 --> 02:07:35,610
- You want them to love you.
- No, I don't.

1772
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:38,530
- I'm not Jack Kennedy.
- They never will, Dick.

1773
02:07:38,610 --> 02:07:43,370
No matter how many elections you win,
they never will.

1774
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:10,560
Gentlemen, the president.

1775
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:24,580
Gentlemen, this is our last damn leak.

1776
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:27,250
It's no way to run
a goddamn government.

1777
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:32,080
We're gonna prosecute Ellsberg
and anyone else who wants to leak

1778
02:08:32,170 --> 02:08:36,340
and that means anyone here
who crosses the line, I'm going after.

1779
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:40,220
OK? The permissiveness
of this year is over.

1780
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:43,760
The belts are coming off and people
are gonna go to the woodshed.

1781
02:08:43,850 --> 02:08:48,140
'Cause the government cannot survive
with a counter-government inside it.

1782
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:51,600
I know how traitors operate.
I've dealt with them all my life.

1783
02:08:51,690 --> 02:08:53,600
I've worked with these cases.

1784
02:08:53,690 --> 02:08:56,570
It's never little people.
The little people do not leak.

1785
02:08:56,650 --> 02:09:00,110
It's always some smooth son of a bitch
like Ellsberg.

1786
02:09:00,190 --> 02:09:05,120
The Harvard Hebrew boys who leak.

1787
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:09,830
I hear people say, "But Ellsberg
did it for the good of the country.

1788
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:12,370
People's right to know."

1789
02:09:13,370 --> 02:09:17,880
Well, that's in every case.
Alger Hiss said the same thing.

1790
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:20,590
So did the Rosenbergs.
Look what happened to them.

1791
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:23,220
Old Sparky got 'em.

1792
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:25,600
They always
underestimated old Nixon, see.

1793
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:29,180
We're gonna fight just as dirty.
This is sudden death, gentlemen.

1794
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:31,180
We're gonna get 'em on the ground,

1795
02:09:31,270 --> 02:09:34,520
stick in our spikes and twist
and show them no mercy.

1796
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:39,280
So, uh, starting today,
no one in this room talks to the press

1797
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:43,610
without checking with Mr. Haldeman here.

1798
02:09:43,700 --> 02:09:47,990
That means we're on complete freeze
on The New York Times, CBS,

1799
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:51,910
<i>PBS, Jack Anderson
and The Washington Post.</i>

1800
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,750
Mr. Haldeman is the chief high
executioner from now on.

1801
02:09:55,830 --> 02:10:00,170
Don't come whining to me when he tells
you to do something. That's me talking.

1802
02:10:00,250 --> 02:10:03,630
If you do come to me,
I'm tougher than he is.

1803
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:07,430
Anyone who screws with us,
his fucking head comes off.

1804
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:08,850
You got that?

1805
02:10:12,850 --> 02:10:15,310
Well, thank you very much, gentlemen.

1806
02:10:15,390 --> 02:10:17,400
Good day to you.

1807
02:10:23,950 --> 02:10:28,700
<i>History will never be the same.</i>

1808
02:10:28,780 --> 02:10:31,700
<i>We've taken a step into the future.</i>

1809
02:10:31,790 --> 02:10:33,660
<i>We have changed the world.</i>

1810
02:10:33,750 --> 02:10:36,920
- Five, ten.
- What else you got?

1811
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:05,740
I must say, you look very good,
Mr. Chairman.

1812
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:10,910
Looks can be deceiving.

1813
02:11:10,990 --> 02:11:14,830
We know what risks you've taken
in inviting us here.

1814
02:11:14,910 --> 02:11:16,750
I took no risk.

1815
02:11:16,830 --> 02:11:20,790
I am too old to be afraid
of what anyone thinks.

1816
02:11:28,590 --> 02:11:31,930
Don't ever trust them.
They never tell the truth

1817
02:11:32,010 --> 02:11:34,640
or honor their commitments.

1818
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:38,100
Vietnamese are like Russians.

1819
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:39,850
Both are dogs.

1820
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:42,980
Mr. Chairman,
there's an old saying in my country:

1821
02:11:43,070 --> 02:11:46,570
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

1822
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:51,620
That has
the added virtue of being true.

1823
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:54,790
Your writings have
changed the world, Mr. Chairman.

1824
02:11:58,620 --> 02:12:03,880
Bullshit.
My writings mean absolutely nothing.

1825
02:12:06,630 --> 02:12:11,340
- I want to know your secret.
- My secret, Mr. Chairman?

1826
02:12:17,980 --> 02:12:20,690
How a fat man gets so many girls.

1827
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:29,320
Power, Mr. Chairman,
is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

1828
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:39,660
You know,
I voted for you in your last election.

1829
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:41,920
I was the, uh, lesser of two evils.

1830
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:46,250
You are too modest,
Mr. Nixon.

1831
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:50,550
You are as evil as I am.

1832
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:54,010
We are the new emperors.

1833
02:12:55,350 --> 02:13:00,770
We are both from poor families
and others pay to feed the hunger in us.

1834
02:13:01,690 --> 02:13:04,690
In my case, millions of reactionaries.

1835
02:13:04,770 --> 02:13:08,610
In your case, millions of Vietnamese.

1836
02:13:08,690 --> 02:13:11,530
Civil war is always
the cruelest kind of war,

1837
02:13:11,610 --> 02:13:14,370
but our two nations
were forged by revolution.

1838
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:16,280
The United States, China.

1839
02:13:16,370 --> 02:13:20,750
Peace? Is peace
all you're interested in?

1840
02:13:20,830 --> 02:13:23,420
The real war is in us.

1841
02:13:28,380 --> 02:13:32,130
History is a symptom of our disease.

1842
02:13:37,140 --> 02:13:39,890
<i>In a surprise Christmas
bombing of Hanoi,</i>

1843
02:13:39,970 --> 02:13:42,310
<i>President Nixon delivered more tonnage</i>

1844
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:45,400
<i>than was used at Dresden
in World War II.</i>

1845
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:49,690
<i>It is without doubt the most brutal
bombing in American history.</i>

1846
02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:53,240
<i>Newspapers are calling it
a Stone Age tactic</i>

1847
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:56,990
<i>and Nixon a maddened tyrant.
Nixon's response:</i>

1848
02:13:57,070 --> 02:14:01,950
<i>"When the Vietnamese take the Paris
peace talks seriously, I'll stop."</i>

1849
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:18,890
A penny for your thoughts.

1850
02:14:21,850 --> 02:14:24,020
Just think of the...

1851
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:25,850
Think of the life Mao's led.

1852
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:30,650
In '52, I... I called him a monster.

1853
02:14:31,690 --> 02:14:35,490
Now he could be our most important ally.

1854
02:14:35,570 --> 02:14:38,910
Only Nixon could've done that.

1855
02:14:38,990 --> 02:14:41,160
You're a long way from Whittier.

1856
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:45,790
Yep. Yes, I am.

1857
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:49,960
Congratulations, Dick.

1858
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:52,050
- Mr. Ziegler.
- Mr. President,

1859
02:14:52,130 --> 02:14:54,630
the press guys asked
if you could come back.

1860
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:57,640
- The hell with them.
- I'll go back, Mr. President.

1861
02:14:57,720 --> 02:15:00,930
No, they want you, Mr. President.
I, uh...

1862
02:15:01,010 --> 02:15:03,220
I think it would be a good move.

1863
02:15:07,810 --> 02:15:09,310
- Who's back there?
- Everybody.

1864
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:11,270
OK.

1865
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:16,150
Gentlemen, I go now
to discover the exact length,

1866
02:15:16,240 --> 02:15:17,950
width and depth of the shaft.

1867
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:29,040
Ladies and gentlemen, the president.

1868
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:31,250
- Hi.
- Hi.

1869
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:33,670
- Mr. President...
- Congratulations, sir.

1870
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:36,170
- Well done!
- Thank you, sir!

1871
02:15:57,400 --> 02:16:00,660
Well, it looks to me

1872
02:16:00,740 --> 02:16:04,990
like we're gonna lose a war
for the first goddamn time.

1873
02:16:05,080 --> 02:16:08,460
- Yep.
- You're goin' right along with it,

1874
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:11,330
buyin' into this Kissinger bullshit,

1875
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:15,750
this... detente with Communists.

1876
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:18,970
Detente. Sounds like
a couple of fags dancin'.

1877
02:16:23,890 --> 02:16:27,600
Jack, we're not living in the same
country you and I knew in '46.

1878
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:31,150
Our people are just not gonna sacrifice
in major numbers for war.

1879
02:16:31,230 --> 02:16:34,360
Can't even get 'em to accept cuts
in their gas tax.

1880
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:38,280
Now, the Arabs and the Japanese
are draining the gold reserves...

1881
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:39,400
Whose fault is that?

1882
02:16:39,490 --> 02:16:42,910
If we'd won in Vietnam,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

1883
02:16:42,990 --> 02:16:46,490
Nobody's fault, Jack. It's, uh, change.
It's a fact of history.

1884
02:16:46,580 --> 02:16:49,710
Even that old cocksucker
J. Edgar Hoover's dead.

1885
02:16:49,790 --> 02:16:52,040
Now who'd have thought that possible?

1886
02:16:53,830 --> 02:16:56,500
How's the food over there in China,
Mr. Nixon?

1887
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:59,010
It's delicious, if you're president.

1888
02:17:01,050 --> 02:17:04,600
So, what are you gonna do
about that Allende fella

1889
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:09,180
nationalizing our businesses in Chile?
You gonna send Kissinger down there?

1890
02:17:09,270 --> 02:17:13,650
We're gonna get rid of him, Allende,
I mean, just as fast as we can.

1891
02:17:13,730 --> 02:17:17,270
- He's at the top of the list.
- How about Kissinger along with him?

1892
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:20,240
Now, Kissinger's misunderstood.

1893
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:23,030
He acts like a liberal
for his establishment friends,

1894
02:17:23,110 --> 02:17:26,620
- but he's even tougher than I am.
- So Kissinger stays.

1895
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:29,290
Just like Castro, Mr. Nixon.

1896
02:17:30,870 --> 02:17:33,500
Yeah. He stays.

1897
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:37,800
And you are comfortable
with that decision?

1898
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:42,380
Desi's got a point.

1899
02:17:42,470 --> 02:17:47,640
What the hell are we gonna do about
the Communists in our own backyard?

1900
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:49,890
What do you really mean, Jack?

1901
02:17:49,970 --> 02:17:53,310
I mean, I got
federal price controls on my oil.

1902
02:17:53,390 --> 02:17:57,310
And the rag heads
are beatin' the shit out of me, Dick.

1903
02:17:57,400 --> 02:18:01,240
And your EPA environmental agency
has got its thumb so far up my ass,

1904
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:04,360
- it's scratchin' my ear!
- I think it's time for us to be...

1905
02:18:04,450 --> 02:18:07,450
- Let him finish, Bob.
- I got a federal judge orderin' me

1906
02:18:07,530 --> 02:18:12,250
to bus my grandkids halfway across this
town to go to school with nigger kids.

1907
02:18:13,580 --> 02:18:17,380
Now, Dick, Mr. President,

1908
02:18:17,460 --> 02:18:20,300
aren't you forgetting
who put you where you are?

1909
02:18:21,550 --> 02:18:25,470
The American people
put me where I am, Jack.

1910
02:18:25,550 --> 02:18:27,590
Really?

1911
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:31,810
- Well, that can be changed.
- In a heartbeat.

1912
02:18:41,030 --> 02:18:44,820
Jack, I've learned politics
is the art of compromise.

1913
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:48,530
I learned it the hard way.
I don't know if you have.

1914
02:18:48,620 --> 02:18:50,490
Well, let me tell you this, Jack.

1915
02:18:50,580 --> 02:18:53,290
If you don't like it,
there's an election in November

1916
02:18:53,370 --> 02:18:56,960
and you can take your money out
in the open and give it to Wallace.

1917
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:00,920
How about it, Jack? Willing to do that?

1918
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:06,260
Hand this country over to some pansy
poet socialist like George McGovern?

1919
02:19:08,140 --> 02:19:11,640
'Cause if you're not happy
with the EPA up your ass,

1920
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:14,270
try the IRS.

1921
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:17,900
Goddamn, Dick.

1922
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:23,400
- You're not threatening me, are ya?
- Presidents don't threaten, Jack.

1923
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:25,530
They don't have to.

1924
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:30,490
Good day to you, gentlemen. Thank you.

1925
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:58,890
<i>With third party candidate
George Wallace out of the race,</i>

1926
02:19:58,980 --> 02:20:00,850
<i>paralyzed by an assassin's bullet,</i>

1927
02:20:00,940 --> 02:20:03,570
<i>Richard Nixon
has crushed George McGovern</i>

1928
02:20:03,650 --> 02:20:06,690
<i>in the 1972 presidential election.</i>

1929
02:20:06,780 --> 02:20:11,570
<i>It is the second-biggest landslide
in American history.</i>

1930
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:13,280
<i>As the new term begins,</i>

1931
02:20:13,370 --> 02:20:16,790
<i>it does not seem the Watergate
investigations have damaged Nixon</i>

1932
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:20,170
<i>politically in any significant way.</i>

1933
02:20:21,670 --> 02:20:24,710
Probably our biggest achievement
as an administration,

1934
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:27,970
when it's all said and done,
isn't China or Russia.

1935
02:20:28,050 --> 02:20:31,720
It's pulling out of Vietnam
without a right-wing revolt.

1936
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:36,270
- I believe you're right.
- The presidency isn't enough anymore.

1937
02:20:37,890 --> 02:20:42,190
- Sir?
- The presidency by itself

1938
02:20:42,270 --> 02:20:46,730
won't protect us, Bob.
We're beyond politics now.

1939
02:20:50,950 --> 02:20:54,490
- Mr. Ehrlichman.
- Yeah.

1940
02:20:55,530 --> 02:20:59,750
Sir, just in from Paris. The Vietnamese
have accepted Henry's peace proposal.

1941
02:20:59,830 --> 02:21:02,170
- Good.
- The bombing worked. They're caving.

1942
02:21:02,250 --> 02:21:04,000
Congratulations!

1943
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:08,210
That mad bomber theory
wasn't so crazy after all.

1944
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:10,010
Henry is coming back to join us.

1945
02:21:10,090 --> 02:21:13,180
He wants to be included
in the photographs, of course.

1946
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:15,890
- There's a surprise.
- This could be it.

1947
02:21:15,970 --> 02:21:18,850
This could be it. Four long years. Jeez.

1948
02:21:18,930 --> 02:21:22,810
Incidentally, I don't know if this is
the right time, but you should know.

1949
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:27,070
Bill Sullivan at the FBI got back
to us with his report on Kissinger.

1950
02:21:28,780 --> 02:21:31,740
- I didn't wanna bring it up because...
- Go on.

1951
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:37,620
Well, Sullivan, uh, thinks he's the one.
Henry's the leaker.

1952
02:21:46,750 --> 02:21:48,340
Yeah, I knew it.

1953
02:21:48,420 --> 02:21:51,010
I knew it from '69 on
and I said it all along.

1954
02:21:51,090 --> 02:21:53,630
- I remember.
- I didn't, Bob.

1955
02:21:54,970 --> 02:21:58,310
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft
and The Times.

1956
02:21:59,310 --> 02:22:01,810
Claims that he was dead
set against the bombing,

1957
02:22:01,890 --> 02:22:05,900
that you were unstable and that, uh,
he has to handle you with kid gloves.

1958
02:22:05,980 --> 02:22:08,230
That explains
his press notices.

1959
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:10,690
Working both sides of the fence.
Jew-boy Henry.

1960
02:22:12,490 --> 02:22:14,280
My God.

1961
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:17,030
- He talked to The New York Times?
- Yes, he did.

1962
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:20,160
We ought a fire his whining
ass right now, when he's on top.

1963
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:23,910
You know what? It'd set the right
example for the this administration.

1964
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:27,330
I would personally
volunteer for that assignment right now.

1965
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:37,010
No. No.

1966
02:22:37,090 --> 02:22:40,850
He's our only star right now.
He'd go crying to the press.

1967
02:22:40,930 --> 02:22:43,850
He'd crucify us.

1968
02:22:43,930 --> 02:22:46,060
Son of a bitch.

1969
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:47,980
Get someone on our staff on his ass.

1970
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:50,610
Tap his phones.
I wanna know everyone he talks to.

1971
02:22:50,690 --> 02:22:53,650
Let's see how long
the Kissinger mystique lasts.

1972
02:22:53,740 --> 02:22:56,950
So, John, what about
these Watergate clowns?

1973
02:22:57,030 --> 02:23:00,780
This, uh, Sirica's crazy.
Thirty-five year sentence.

1974
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:04,580
No weapons, right? No injuries.

1975
02:23:04,660 --> 02:23:06,960
There's no success.
It's just ridiculous.

1976
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:10,630
Sirica's just trying to force someone
to testify, but they're solid.

1977
02:23:10,710 --> 02:23:14,970
What about this Washington Post crap?
Woodwind and Fernstein.

1978
02:23:15,050 --> 02:23:17,880
- Bernstein, sir.
- Who the fuck are they, anyway?

1979
02:23:17,970 --> 02:23:20,890
Bob, you working on revoking
their television license?

1980
02:23:20,970 --> 02:23:22,350
- Yes, sir, I am.
- Good.

1981
02:23:22,430 --> 02:23:25,810
Well, they're trying to connect
Bob and John with the secret fund.

1982
02:23:25,890 --> 02:23:28,900
- But they don't have much.
- They don't have anything.

1983
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:32,690
The F.B.I.'s feeding me their reports.

1984
02:23:32,770 --> 02:23:35,900
I didn't think you should lose any
more sleep over it, sir.

1985
02:23:35,990 --> 02:23:38,570
Good man, John, good man.

1986
02:23:50,750 --> 02:23:56,010
I can therefore announce that our long
and tragic involvement in Vietnam...

1987
02:23:56,090 --> 02:24:00,090
...is at an end.
Our mission is accomplished.

1988
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:04,810
We have a cease-fire...

1989
02:24:04,890 --> 02:24:08,520
...and our prisoners of war
are coming back home.

1990
02:24:08,600 --> 02:24:13,940
South Vietnam has the right
to determine its own future.

1991
02:24:14,020 --> 02:24:17,150
So, we have peace with honor.

1992
02:24:22,780 --> 02:24:25,370
The president will take
some of your questions now.

1993
02:24:25,450 --> 02:24:27,450
- Mr. President!
- Dan.

1994
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:29,500
Isn't it true little has been achieved

1995
02:24:29,580 --> 02:24:32,380
that the Communists
have not been offering since 1969,

1996
02:24:32,460 --> 02:24:35,960
that in fact your administration
has needlessly prolonged the war

1997
02:24:36,050 --> 02:24:38,300
and escalated it
to new levels of violence?

1998
02:24:38,380 --> 02:24:43,720
I will, uh... try to answer
that question in some detail.

1999
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:45,310
Mr. President!

2000
02:24:45,390 --> 02:24:47,970
What is your reaction
to James McCord's statement

2001
02:24:48,060 --> 02:24:50,140
that high-level White House officials

2002
02:24:50,230 --> 02:24:52,400
were involved
in the Watergate break-in?

2003
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:55,650
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

2004
02:24:55,730 --> 02:24:59,150
The Washington Post is reporting
that Mr. Haldeman and Ehrlichman

2005
02:24:59,240 --> 02:25:01,990
secretly dispersed
up to $900,000 in campaign funds.

2006
02:25:02,070 --> 02:25:03,570
Is there any truth to that?

2007
02:25:03,660 --> 02:25:05,830
Now, let me make this perfectly clear.

2008
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:09,330
<i>I will not respond to the charges
of The Washington Post.</i>

2009
02:25:09,410 --> 02:25:13,420
Nor will I comment on a matter
that is currently before the courts.

2010
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:16,210
- Mr. President!
- Sir!

2011
02:25:16,290 --> 02:25:19,590
Sir, do you intend to cooperate
with Senator Ervin's committee?

2012
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:22,760
Will you agree to the appointment
of a special prosecutor?

2013
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:25,550
- Mr. President, sir!
- Mr. President!

2014
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:30,890
- Thank you.
- Mr. President!

2015
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:38,230
Mr. President, sir...

2016
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:40,530
Ron, get in there and do something!

2017
02:25:45,530 --> 02:25:47,620
I end the longest war
in American history

2018
02:25:47,700 --> 02:25:51,790
and they keep harping on this
chicken-shit! God!

2019
02:25:51,870 --> 02:25:53,460
God!

2020
02:25:56,250 --> 02:25:59,050
You know who's behind this, don't you?
Teddy Kennedy.

2021
02:25:59,130 --> 02:26:03,300
Yeah, he drowns a broad in his car,
and he can't run for president.

2022
02:26:03,380 --> 02:26:06,180
He did get pretty
burned at Chappaquiddick.

2023
02:26:06,260 --> 02:26:09,970
My point exactly! Somebody had to die
before he got his shit in the papers!

2024
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:13,730
Fucking Kennedys get away
with everything! Goddamn them!

2025
02:26:13,810 --> 02:26:16,190
You see me screwin'
everything that moves?

2026
02:26:17,230 --> 02:26:20,480
For Christ's sake, I did what
The New York Times editorial page

2027
02:26:20,570 --> 02:26:24,070
said for me to do!
I ended the war!

2028
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:28,200
I got S.A.L.T. One with the Russians,
I opened China.

2029
02:26:28,280 --> 02:26:31,200
So why are these assholes
turning on me?

2030
02:26:31,290 --> 02:26:34,410
'Cause they don't like the way I look,
where I went to school!

2031
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:37,630
- Because they're not Americans.
- They don't trust America.

2032
02:26:37,710 --> 02:26:39,340
Why would they?

2033
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:42,300
They just come here to stick
their snouts in the trough.

2034
02:26:42,380 --> 02:26:44,340
Who are these people? Sulzberger.

2035
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:47,140
Their parents are gold traders
from eastern Europe,

2036
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:49,010
with due respect.
They buy things.

2037
02:26:49,100 --> 02:26:52,930
They come to "Jew" York city and buy up
things. And one of the things they buy,

2038
02:26:53,020 --> 02:26:57,020
Mr. President, is The New York Times.
You know what? You should be proud,

2039
02:26:57,100 --> 02:26:59,310
because they'll never trust you, sir.

2040
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:02,110
Because we speak
for the average American.

2041
02:27:02,190 --> 02:27:04,780
You know why they're turning on me?

2042
02:27:04,860 --> 02:27:08,450
It's because they're not serious
about power, that's why.

2043
02:27:08,530 --> 02:27:10,700
They're playing with power.

2044
02:27:10,780 --> 02:27:13,330
They're forgetting
the national interest.

2045
02:27:13,410 --> 02:27:17,250
In the old days people knew
how to hold power, how to set limits.

2046
02:27:17,330 --> 02:27:21,040
They wouldn't have torn this country
apart over a third-rate burglary.

2047
02:27:21,130 --> 02:27:24,710
For Christ's sake, now all they
care about are their egos,

2048
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,720
looking good at cocktail parties.

2049
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:29,050
Beating out other papers
and chasing girls.

2050
02:27:29,140 --> 02:27:32,220
Wondering whether someone
said something nice about them.

2051
02:27:32,310 --> 02:27:34,140
Short-term, frivolous bullshit.

2052
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:37,640
Ben Bradlee worrying
about Teddy Kennedy liking him.

2053
02:27:38,350 --> 02:27:40,940
- Get Mr. Dean in here, Will you?
- Mr. President,

2054
02:27:41,020 --> 02:27:45,690
I fear we are drifting toward oblivion.
We are playing a totally reactive game.

2055
02:27:45,780 --> 02:27:51,160
We have to get ahead of the ball.
Now, we all know that you are clean.

2056
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:53,240
Right?

2057
02:27:53,330 --> 02:27:57,750
Then let's take off the gloves.
Let's do a housecleaning.

2058
02:27:57,830 --> 02:28:00,040
Housecleaning?

2059
02:28:07,510 --> 02:28:09,930
No, it could be ugly, Henry,
really ugly.

2060
02:28:10,010 --> 02:28:12,600
It must be done, sir.
Your government is paralyzed.

2061
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:15,390
All kinds of shit could come out.
The Ellsberg thing.

2062
02:28:15,470 --> 02:28:17,480
You knew about that, didn't you, Henry?

2063
02:28:17,560 --> 02:28:19,940
Well, I heard something.
It sounded idiotic.

2064
02:28:20,020 --> 02:28:21,650
Idiotic.
Yeah, I suppose it was.

2065
02:28:21,730 --> 02:28:24,860
I thought it was your idea
to expose Ellsberg as a sex fiend.

2066
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:27,280
I guess somebody just
took you too literally.

2067
02:28:27,360 --> 02:28:31,570
I never suggested a bunch of imbeciles
break into a psychiatrist's office.

2068
02:28:31,660 --> 02:28:35,450
It doesn't matter. The point is you
might lose your media darling halo

2069
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:38,460
if the media start sniffing
around our dirty laundry.

2070
02:28:38,540 --> 02:28:42,330
Sir, I never had anything to do with
that and I resent the implication...

2071
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:46,880
Resent it all you want, Henry,
but you're in with the rest of us.

2072
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:51,340
Cambodia. Ellsberg.
The wiretaps you put in.

2073
02:28:51,430 --> 02:28:54,640
The president wants you to know
you can't just click your heels

2074
02:28:54,720 --> 02:28:58,020
and head back to Harvard Yard.
It's your ass too, Henry,

2075
02:28:58,100 --> 02:29:01,560
and it's in the wind
twisting with everyone else's.

2076
02:29:11,530 --> 02:29:14,320
- Sir.
- Yeah?

2077
02:29:14,410 --> 02:29:19,580
There are times when
even the president can go too far.

2078
02:29:23,460 --> 02:29:26,670
You played it perfectly, sir.
That cocksucker'll think twice

2079
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:29,130
- before he leaks again.
- Yeah.

2080
02:29:29,210 --> 02:29:32,840
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl
every time he pulls the chain.

2081
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:36,260
Hunt wants more money.

2082
02:29:36,350 --> 02:29:38,720
- Another 122,000.
- Fuck.

2083
02:29:38,810 --> 02:29:42,350
If he doesn't get it right away,
he's going to blow us out of the water.

2084
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:45,360
He means it. Since his wife died
in the plane crash, he's over the edge.

2085
02:29:45,440 --> 02:29:47,020
Pay him. Pay him what he wants.

2086
02:29:47,110 --> 02:29:51,490
We gotta turn the faucet off on Hunt and
these Cubans. They're out of control.

2087
02:29:51,570 --> 02:29:53,780
John, you might want to...

2088
02:29:53,860 --> 02:29:55,950
It's gotta be Helms. He's behind this.

2089
02:29:56,030 --> 02:29:58,490
- I think we can leverage Helms.
- How?

2090
02:29:58,580 --> 02:30:02,870
When I met with him,
he kind of tipped his hand.

2091
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:05,210
This affair,
the president wants you to know,

2092
02:30:05,290 --> 02:30:07,960
is related to the Bay of Pigs.
And if it comes out...

2093
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:10,380
This has nothing to do
with the Bay of Pigs!

2094
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:14,050
I have no concern
about the Bay of Pigs!

2095
02:30:14,130 --> 02:30:16,390
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

2096
02:30:16,470 --> 02:30:19,850
This is what the president
told me to relay to you, Dick.

2097
02:30:19,930 --> 02:30:22,390
I had to remind him
who he was talking to.

2098
02:30:22,480 --> 02:30:26,190
So I was wondering? What's such
dynamite in this Bay of Pigs thing?

2099
02:30:26,270 --> 02:30:27,980
Sir.

2100
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:35,410
Though it was clearly effective, because
all of a sudden it was no problem

2101
02:30:35,490 --> 02:30:38,660
for Helms to go to the FBI
and try to put a lid on Watergate.

2102
02:30:39,530 --> 02:30:43,120
- What about the documents promised?
- He'll give us the documents.

2103
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:46,750
But I think if we offer him
an ambassadorship,

2104
02:30:46,830 --> 02:30:50,040
the ambassadorship to Iran,
we can get rid of him. He'll go...

2105
02:30:50,130 --> 02:30:54,760
- No, I promised Iran to Townsend.
- Townsend in Belgium. It's available.

2106
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:59,430
He gave us 300 grand. Belgium's
not worth more than 100, 150.

2107
02:30:59,510 --> 02:31:01,180
What about England?

2108
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:04,100
Forget it.
Annenberg's paid three times that much.

2109
02:31:04,180 --> 02:31:07,350
Helms wants Iran,
or there might be a problem.

2110
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:10,230
All his old buddies are over there
making a fortune...

2111
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:11,780
When does this end, Bob?

2112
02:31:11,860 --> 02:31:13,360
- Executive clemency.
- What?

2113
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:17,570
Hunt and the Cubans have nothing to lose
now. Pardon them all.

2114
02:31:17,660 --> 02:31:20,780
Nobody investigates a crime
for which criminals have been pardoned.

2115
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:22,910
- Yeah, I like that.
- But it'll never do.

2116
02:31:22,990 --> 02:31:26,370
Pardoning them means we're guilty.
Press, the people'll go nuts.

2117
02:31:26,460 --> 02:31:29,290
Am I supposed to sit here
and watch them coming closer,

2118
02:31:29,380 --> 02:31:31,040
eating their way to the center?

2119
02:31:31,130 --> 02:31:33,250
Lyndon bugged, so did Kennedy.

2120
02:31:33,340 --> 02:31:37,970
F.D.R. cut a deal with Lucky Luciano.
Christ, even Eisenhower had a mistress.

2121
02:31:38,050 --> 02:31:41,470
What's so special about me? Huh?

2122
02:31:41,550 --> 02:31:46,020
What about Lyndon? He could make
a couple calls to the... Hell, and...

2123
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:48,600
...shut this whole damn thing down.

2124
02:31:48,690 --> 02:31:50,310
- Anyone talk to him?
- I have.

2125
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:52,650
- What'd he say?
- No dice, he hit the roof.

2126
02:31:52,730 --> 02:31:54,110
Why?

2127
02:31:54,190 --> 02:31:57,650
He said if you go out with a story
about how he bugged your plane,

2128
02:31:57,740 --> 02:31:59,610
he's gonna reveal...

2129
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:09,620
He's gonna reveal...

2130
02:32:10,580 --> 02:32:12,840
- ...Vietnamese peace talks...
- All right.

2131
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:14,840
All right! Stop!

2132
02:32:14,920 --> 02:32:16,590
What's the matter with you?

2133
02:32:18,050 --> 02:32:22,680
I know. I just know
we've made too many enemies.

2134
02:32:23,430 --> 02:32:27,350
There's another thing. Bob and I have to
testify before the urban committee.

2135
02:32:27,430 --> 02:32:30,650
No, you're not.
You're gonna claim executive privilege.

2136
02:32:30,730 --> 02:32:33,020
You're gonna stonewall it
all the way.

2137
02:32:33,110 --> 02:32:35,440
Plead the 5th Amendment.
I don't give a shit.

2138
02:32:35,530 --> 02:32:38,190
They can't force
the president's people to testify.

2139
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:40,820
Executive privilege
looks like we're covering.

2140
02:32:40,910 --> 02:32:43,320
We are covering up
for God's sake.

2141
02:32:43,410 --> 02:32:45,450
Some petty, stupid shit.

2142
02:32:46,540 --> 02:32:50,460
There are things I can say what
other people said, and they'd be lies.

2143
02:32:50,540 --> 02:32:53,790
When I say them,
nobody believes me anyway.

2144
02:32:55,550 --> 02:32:58,300
Then, we're going to
have to give them Mitchell.

2145
02:33:00,220 --> 02:33:02,510
Mitchell's family.

2146
02:33:02,590 --> 02:33:05,680
Either it goes to Mitchell,
or it comes here.

2147
02:33:07,020 --> 02:33:08,810
John's right, boss.

2148
02:33:09,980 --> 02:33:13,730
It's not personal.
It's just the way the game is played.

2149
02:33:13,810 --> 02:33:16,150
Sometimes you gotta punt.

2150
02:33:21,820 --> 02:33:23,410
Jesus.

2151
02:33:23,490 --> 02:33:26,580
I'm so goddamn worn-out with this.

2152
02:33:35,710 --> 02:33:37,300
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?

2153
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:39,050
- You do it.
- Why me?

2154
02:33:39,710 --> 02:33:43,300
'Cause he hates you. It's worse
when you get it from someone you trust.

2155
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:45,510
Hey. He's wrong, you know.

2156
02:33:47,060 --> 02:33:49,640
About Kennedy and L.B.J. and Truman.

2157
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:50,770
How so?

2158
02:33:50,850 --> 02:33:54,310
Well, I mean, sure, they did stuff, Bob,
but nothing like this.

2159
02:33:54,400 --> 02:33:59,610
I mean, forget about the break-in,
the, the enemies list, the... You know?

2160
02:33:59,690 --> 02:34:03,200
You got the attempted firebombing
of the Brookings Institution.

2161
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:06,620
Planting McGovern stuff
on the guy that shot Wallace?

2162
02:34:06,700 --> 02:34:08,740
Trying to slip L.S.D. to Jack Anderson?

2163
02:34:08,830 --> 02:34:11,330
Old man plays politics
harder than anybody else.

2164
02:34:11,410 --> 02:34:13,620
You think this is about politics?

2165
02:34:13,710 --> 02:34:17,420
Do you think L.B.J. would have
ever asked Hunt to forge a cable

2166
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:21,300
implicating Kennedy in the assassination
of the president of Vietnam?

2167
02:34:21,380 --> 02:34:23,590
How long have you known Bob,
20 years?

2168
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:27,140
This is the Roosevelt Room,
named after our 26th president

2169
02:34:27,220 --> 02:34:29,430
20 years, you ever shake hands with him?

2170
02:34:29,510 --> 02:34:31,850
Ever have a real conversation with him?

2171
02:34:34,310 --> 02:34:37,650
No, this...
This is about Richard Nixon.

2172
02:34:37,730 --> 02:34:40,980
You got people dying because
he didn't make varsity football.

2173
02:34:41,070 --> 02:34:43,650
You got the Constitution hanging by
a thread

2174
02:34:43,740 --> 02:34:47,070
because he went to Whittier,
not to Yale.

2175
02:34:47,740 --> 02:34:49,990
And what is this Bay of Pigs thing?

2176
02:34:50,080 --> 02:34:52,250
Goes white every time you mention it.

2177
02:34:54,120 --> 02:34:57,790
- It's a code or something.
- Well, shit, even I figured that out.

2178
02:34:59,210 --> 02:35:01,090
I think he means...

2179
02:35:03,010 --> 02:35:05,720
- The Kennedy assassination...
- Yeah?

2180
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:10,180
They went after Castro and in some
crazy way it got turned back on Kennedy.

2181
02:35:10,260 --> 02:35:14,390
I don't think the old man knows what
happened. But he's afraid to find out.

2182
02:35:14,480 --> 02:35:17,690
He's shitting peach pits every time
he thinks about it.

2183
02:35:17,770 --> 02:35:20,480
Created a Frankenstein
with those damn Cubans.

2184
02:35:20,570 --> 02:35:23,400
Eight words back in '72:

2185
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:29,160
"I covered up." "I was wrong."
"I'm sorry."

2186
02:35:29,240 --> 02:35:31,950
And the American public
would've forgiven him.

2187
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:35,160
But we never opened our mouths, John.

2188
02:35:36,120 --> 02:35:38,040
We failed him.

2189
02:35:38,120 --> 02:35:42,210
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"?
That'll be the day.

2190
02:35:42,300 --> 02:35:44,880
His whole suit of armor would fall off.

2191
02:35:44,960 --> 02:35:49,180
- So, you tell Mitchell.
- Yeah.

2192
02:35:49,260 --> 02:35:53,260
And John, you do know
that we're next, don't you?

2193
02:36:08,490 --> 02:36:10,620
You're early, John.

2194
02:36:12,950 --> 02:36:16,660
If you'd been that stealthy at the
Watergate, we wouldn't be in this mess.

2195
02:36:18,660 --> 02:36:22,210
- I was sorry to hear about your wife.
- Yes.

2196
02:36:23,880 --> 02:36:25,550
Take out the money.

2197
02:36:25,630 --> 02:36:28,760
The president would like to know
if that was the last payment.

2198
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:31,510
- I'll bet he would.
- Is it?

2199
02:36:32,970 --> 02:36:35,930
In Richard Nixon's long history
of underhanded dealings

2200
02:36:36,020 --> 02:36:39,810
he's never had better value for his
money. If I were to open my mouth,

2201
02:36:39,890 --> 02:36:42,440
all the dominoes would fall.

2202
02:36:43,860 --> 02:36:45,940
Can I ask you a question?

2203
02:36:46,030 --> 02:36:47,940
How the hell do you have the temerity

2204
02:36:48,030 --> 02:36:50,910
to blackmail the president
of the United States?

2205
02:36:50,990 --> 02:36:55,200
That's not the question, John.
The question is, why is he paying?

2206
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:59,120
- To protect his people.
- I'm one of his people.

2207
02:36:59,210 --> 02:37:02,580
The Cubans are his people.
And we're going to jail for him.

2208
02:37:02,670 --> 02:37:06,550
Howard, you will serve no more
than two years, then he'll pardon you.

2209
02:37:06,630 --> 02:37:09,760
Maybe. Maybe not.

2210
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:13,850
But you don't leave your men
on the beach, John.

2211
02:37:13,930 --> 02:37:16,640
You don't make them beg for their money
like thieves.

2212
02:37:16,720 --> 02:37:20,060
You don't dump men with families
who've served their country.

2213
02:37:20,140 --> 02:37:23,150
He didn't know.
This thing has gotten out of hand.

2214
02:37:23,230 --> 02:37:27,070
You think a man as controlled as Richard
Nixon would've allowed a break-in

2215
02:37:27,150 --> 02:37:30,570
at the Democratic National Headquarters
without knowing it?

2216
02:37:30,650 --> 02:37:35,280
You think Mitchell or Haldeman wouldn't
have run it by him at least once?

2217
02:37:35,370 --> 02:37:37,950
The president's men did nothing,

2218
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:41,750
nothing without
Richard Nixon's permission.

2219
02:37:45,380 --> 02:37:47,550
John, sooner or later...

2220
02:37:47,630 --> 02:37:52,180
Sooner, I think, you're going to learn
the lesson that's been learned

2221
02:37:52,260 --> 02:37:55,760
by everyone who's ever
gotten close to Richard Nixon.

2222
02:37:55,850 --> 02:38:00,930
That he's the darkness
reaching out for the darkness.

2223
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:06,310
And eventually it's either you or him.

2224
02:38:08,860 --> 02:38:11,570
Your grave's already been dug, John.

2225
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:28,380
<i>F.B.I. director-designate
L. Patrick Gray</i>

2226
02:38:28,460 --> 02:38:31,170
<i>shocked the Senate
by revealing that John Dean</i>

2227
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:34,680
<i>has been secretly receiving
F.B.I. reports on Watergate.</i>

2228
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:37,010
Crown, this is Echo Six.
How are you, sir?

2229
02:38:37,090 --> 02:38:40,060
<i>Gray also said that Dean lied
when he claimed Howard Hunt</i>

2230
02:38:40,140 --> 02:38:42,390
<i>did not
have an office in the White House.</i>

2231
02:38:42,480 --> 02:38:44,690
- How is he?
- He's in a bad mood.

2232
02:38:44,770 --> 02:38:47,020
He's running late. Have a seat.

2233
02:38:51,030 --> 02:38:53,530
This is the sort of thing
Mafia people can do.

2234
02:38:53,610 --> 02:38:56,990
Washing money, things like that.
We don't know about these things

2235
02:38:57,070 --> 02:38:59,990
- because we're not criminals.
- How much you need?

2236
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:06,370
I would say these people will cost a
million dollars over the next two years.

2237
02:39:06,460 --> 02:39:09,250
We could get that.

2238
02:39:09,340 --> 02:39:13,510
Get a million dollars in cash.
I know where it could be gotten.

2239
02:39:16,380 --> 02:39:19,100
I'm still not confident
we can ride through this.

2240
02:39:19,180 --> 02:39:22,810
Some people are gonna have to go
to jail. Hunt's not the only problem.

2241
02:39:22,890 --> 02:39:27,600
Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash
fund in his safe to make the payments.

2242
02:39:27,690 --> 02:39:31,440
Ehrlichman had a role, a big role,
in the Ellsberg break-in.

2243
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:33,570
Oh, I don't know about that.

2244
02:39:33,650 --> 02:39:37,820
And... And I'm...

2245
02:39:37,910 --> 02:39:41,660
I think it's time we begin to think
in terms of cutting our losses.

2246
02:39:45,370 --> 02:39:49,460
Are you... You're saying
cut our losses, John, and all the rest.

2247
02:39:49,540 --> 02:39:53,670
And, you know, suppose the thing blows
and they indict Bob and the others?

2248
02:39:53,750 --> 02:39:56,970
Jesus, you'd never recover
from that, John. I mean...

2249
02:39:57,050 --> 02:40:01,220
No, it's better to fight it out instead
and not let people testify.

2250
02:40:01,300 --> 02:40:05,890
Sir, I, I still don't think
we can contain this anymore.

2251
02:40:06,810 --> 02:40:10,560
There's a cancer on the presidency,
and it's growing with every day...

2252
02:40:10,650 --> 02:40:12,360
Jesus, you know, every...

2253
02:40:12,440 --> 02:40:16,360
Everything's a crisis among the upper
intellectual types, the softheads.

2254
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:19,490
The average people don't think
it's much of a crisis.

2255
02:40:19,570 --> 02:40:22,950
For Christ's sake, this is not Vietnam.
No one's dying here.

2256
02:40:23,030 --> 02:40:25,160
I mean, isn't it ridiculous?

2257
02:40:25,240 --> 02:40:28,250
- I agree. It's ridiculous but...
- It's goddamn crazy!

2258
02:40:28,330 --> 02:40:30,120
Goldwater was right when he said

2259
02:40:30,210 --> 02:40:34,210
"For Christ's sakes, everybody bugs
everybody else." We know that.

2260
02:40:35,340 --> 02:40:39,720
It's the cover-up, John,
not the deed, that's really bad here.

2261
02:40:41,590 --> 02:40:46,020
If only Mitchell could step up
and take the brunt of it, you know.

2262
02:40:46,100 --> 02:40:50,270
Give 'em the hors d'oeuvre. Maybe they
won't come back for the main course.

2263
02:40:52,100 --> 02:40:54,860
You know, that's the tragedy
in all this. Uh...

2264
02:40:54,940 --> 02:40:58,780
Mitchell's gonna get it anyway,
so it's time he assumed responsibility.

2265
02:40:58,860 --> 02:41:00,780
You're not paying attention.

2266
02:41:00,860 --> 02:41:04,280
He won't. He's told Ehrlichman he won't.

2267
02:41:04,370 --> 02:41:07,870
You tell my good friend Dick
I got suckered into this thing

2268
02:41:07,950 --> 02:41:11,790
by not paying attention
to what these bastards were doing.

2269
02:41:11,870 --> 02:41:15,210
I don't have a guilty conscience,
and he shouldn't either.

2270
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:18,050
Yeah.

2271
02:41:22,470 --> 02:41:23,760
Well, he's right.

2272
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:28,310
Maybe it is time to, uh,
go the hang-out route, John.

2273
02:41:28,390 --> 02:41:31,730
A full and thorough investigation.

2274
02:41:31,810 --> 02:41:36,190
We've cooperated with the F.B.I.
We'll cooperate with the Senate.

2275
02:41:36,270 --> 02:41:39,240
- What have we got to hide?
- No, we've nothing to hide.

2276
02:41:39,320 --> 02:41:41,740
No. Nothing to hide.

2277
02:41:41,820 --> 02:41:42,910
You know, the only...

2278
02:41:42,990 --> 02:41:46,490
The only fault in the plan is
they're not gonna believe the truth.

2279
02:41:46,580 --> 02:41:50,200
- That's the incredible thing.
- I agree. It's... it's tricky.

2280
02:41:51,210 --> 02:41:53,710
Everything seems to lead back here.

2281
02:41:53,790 --> 02:41:56,540
- People would never understand.
- No.

2282
02:41:56,630 --> 02:42:00,010
John, I want you to get away
from this madhouse.

2283
02:42:00,090 --> 02:42:01,880
I want these reporters.

2284
02:42:01,970 --> 02:42:06,760
I want you to go up to Camp David
for the weekend and write up a report.

2285
02:42:06,850 --> 02:42:10,140
Put everything you know
about Watergate in there and say,

2286
02:42:10,220 --> 02:42:13,020
"Mr. President, here it all is." OK?

2287
02:42:13,100 --> 02:42:15,980
You want me to put it all in writing
over my signature?

2288
02:42:17,190 --> 02:42:21,820
Well, uh... nobody knows more
about this thing than you do, John.

2289
02:42:21,900 --> 02:42:24,990
You know, the details.
That stuff I don't know. But.

2290
02:42:29,290 --> 02:42:33,910
Sir, I'm not going to
be the scapegoat for this.

2291
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,830
Haldeman and Ehrlichman
are in it just as deep as I am.

2292
02:42:36,920 --> 02:42:41,710
No, now, John, you don't wanna
start down that road. I remember, uh...

2293
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:45,300
...Whittaker Chambers
telling me back in '48.

2294
02:42:45,380 --> 02:42:47,470
He was a man who suffered greatly.

2295
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:52,140
And he said, "On the road of the
informer, it is always night."

2296
02:42:52,220 --> 02:42:58,060
Now, it's beyond you, or even me, John.
It's the country. It's the presidency.

2297
02:42:58,150 --> 02:43:01,480
- I understand that, sir.
- You know how I feel about loyalty.

2298
02:43:01,570 --> 02:43:05,280
I'm not gonna let any of my people
go to jail, that I promise you.

2299
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:10,490
The important thing is to keep this
away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman.

2300
02:43:10,580 --> 02:43:14,410
I'm trusting you to do this, John, and
I have complete confidence in you. OK?

2301
02:43:14,500 --> 02:43:16,290
- I'll work on it.
- OK.

2302
02:43:16,370 --> 02:43:18,920
Say hi to that wife of yours,
will you? Good.

2303
02:43:20,250 --> 02:43:22,880
- Shit.
- It happens.

2304
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:25,170
The place is a shambles.

2305
02:43:25,260 --> 02:43:26,380
Hey!

2306
02:43:29,640 --> 02:43:33,100
<i>I was determined that we should
get to the bottom of Watergate</i>

2307
02:43:33,180 --> 02:43:37,520
<i>and the truth should be fully brought
out, no matter who was involved.</i>

2308
02:43:38,600 --> 02:43:43,360
<i>Today, in one of the most difficult
decisions of my presidency</i>

2309
02:43:43,440 --> 02:43:47,860
<i>I accepted the resignations of two of my
closest associates in the White House,</i>

2310
02:43:47,950 --> 02:43:50,370
<i>Bob Haldeman and John Ehrlichman,</i>

2311
02:43:50,450 --> 02:43:54,200
<i>two of the finest public servants
it has been my privilege to know.</i>

2312
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:00,670
More light, Chief?

2313
02:44:01,670 --> 02:44:03,300
No, Bob.

2314
02:44:10,430 --> 02:44:11,720
Six bodies.

2315
02:44:11,800 --> 02:44:15,810
<i>The counsel to the president,
John Dean, has also resigned.</i>

2316
02:44:15,890 --> 02:44:18,600
<i>I will not place the
blame on subordinates,</i>

2317
02:44:18,690 --> 02:44:21,810
<i>on people whose zeal
exceeded their judgment,</i>

2318
02:44:21,900 --> 02:44:26,990
<i>and who may have done wrong in a cause
they deeply believed to be right.</i>

2319
02:44:28,650 --> 02:44:33,620
<i>In any organization, the man at the top
must bear the responsibility.</i>

2320
02:44:33,700 --> 02:44:38,910
<i>That responsibility, therefore, belongs
here in this office and I accept that.</i>

2321
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,830
<i>There can be no whitewash
at the White House.</i>

2322
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:44,750
<i>Two wrongs do not make a right.</i>

2323
02:44:44,840 --> 02:44:47,050
<i>Now, l love America.</i>

2324
02:44:47,130 --> 02:44:51,640
God bless America, and God bless each
and every one of you.

2325
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:55,600
And we're clear.

2326
02:44:59,140 --> 02:45:00,600
Out.

2327
02:45:20,410 --> 02:45:21,750
Thank you.

2328
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:30,720
Are you going to Key Biscayne?

2329
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:33,550
- Yeah.
- Excuse me, sir.

2330
02:45:33,640 --> 02:45:35,260
When?

2331
02:45:36,970 --> 02:45:38,520
Tomorrow.

2332
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:49,780
Ron told me that, um...
Bob Haldeman has been calling,

2333
02:45:49,860 --> 02:45:51,990
but you won't talk to him.

2334
02:45:53,450 --> 02:45:55,950
If he's convicted,
will you pardon him?

2335
02:45:59,910 --> 02:46:01,210
No.

2336
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:11,470
Why are you cutting yourself off
from the rest of us?

2337
02:46:13,470 --> 02:46:15,680
Can't we discuss this?

2338
02:46:15,760 --> 02:46:20,680
- What exactly do you want to discuss?
- You. What you're doing.

2339
02:46:21,930 --> 02:46:25,440
- What am I doing?
- I wish I knew. You're hiding.

2340
02:46:28,820 --> 02:46:32,860
- Hiding what?
- Whatever it is you've been hiding.

2341
02:46:32,950 --> 02:46:35,780
You're letting it destroy you, Dick.

2342
02:46:37,450 --> 02:46:39,580
You won't even ask for help...

2343
02:46:44,620 --> 02:46:47,080
Manolo, uh...

2344
02:46:47,170 --> 02:46:49,460
Mrs. Nixon's finished.

2345
02:46:53,050 --> 02:46:55,550
I am the only one left, Dick.

2346
02:46:56,510 --> 02:46:59,050
If you don't even talk to me...

2347
02:47:07,860 --> 02:47:10,770
Brezhnev's coming in three days.

2348
02:47:10,860 --> 02:47:14,860
I don't wanna deal with them
and him and you.

2349
02:47:17,490 --> 02:47:20,740
How much more?
How much more is it going to cost?

2350
02:47:20,830 --> 02:47:24,330
When do the rest of us
stop paying off your debts?

2351
02:47:28,540 --> 02:47:32,340
I'd like to finish my dinner in peace

2352
02:47:32,420 --> 02:47:35,340
if it's not too much to ask.

2353
02:47:39,430 --> 02:47:41,430
No, it isn't.

2354
02:47:45,350 --> 02:47:48,850
I won't interfere with you anymore.
I'm finished trying.

2355
02:47:50,900 --> 02:47:52,940
Thank you.

2356
02:47:53,030 --> 02:47:54,780
"Thank you"?

2357
02:47:55,900 --> 02:47:58,990
Dick, sometimes I understand
why they hate you.

2358
02:48:06,870 --> 02:48:11,960
The committee will come to order.
Counsel will call the first witness.

2359
02:48:12,040 --> 02:48:14,050
Mr. John W. Dean, III.

2360
02:48:14,130 --> 02:48:16,470
After I departed the president's office

2361
02:48:16,550 --> 02:48:20,640
I went to a meeting with Haldeman
and Ehrlichman to discuss the matter.

2362
02:48:20,720 --> 02:48:24,470
<i>The sum and substance
of that discussion was,</i>

2363
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:27,810
<i>the way to handle this now
was for Mitchell to step forward.</i>

2364
02:48:27,890 --> 02:48:31,860
<i>It was a disappointment to me because
it was quite clear that the cover-up,</i>

2365
02:48:31,940 --> 02:48:35,820
<i>as far as the White House was...
was concerned, was going to continue.</i>

2366
02:48:35,900 --> 02:48:38,740
Why is he doing this?
He's our goddamn lawyer.

2367
02:48:38,820 --> 02:48:41,410
If he had a problem,
why didn't he come talk with us?

2368
02:48:41,490 --> 02:48:44,200
Remember, the weasel's got no proof.

2369
02:48:45,580 --> 02:48:48,660
It's still an informer's word
against the president's.

2370
02:48:48,750 --> 02:48:51,500
<i>...were all indictable
for obstruction of justice.</i>

2371
02:48:51,580 --> 02:48:55,500
<i>That was the reason I was disagreeing
with all that was being discussed.</i>

2372
02:48:55,590 --> 02:48:57,090
Give 'em hell, general.

2373
02:49:03,930 --> 02:49:07,310
Mao taught me in 1963...

2374
02:49:09,890 --> 02:49:12,310
...if I have nuclear weapons...

2375
02:49:14,610 --> 02:49:17,610
...let 400 million Chinese die...

2376
02:49:18,780 --> 02:49:21,150
...300 million will be left.

2377
02:49:22,280 --> 02:49:25,240
- Mao!
- Yeah.

2378
02:49:25,870 --> 02:49:29,290
I can tell you what happened.
You want names? I can give you names.

2379
02:49:29,370 --> 02:49:31,620
Haldeman.
I'm talking about the president.

2380
02:49:31,710 --> 02:49:34,000
- Mao!
- We all know in our country...

2381
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:36,000
I can give you the president.

2382
02:49:36,300 --> 02:49:38,630
This man in his dog heart.

2383
02:49:40,970 --> 02:49:43,300
You want him
to be your ally?

2384
02:49:44,680 --> 02:49:47,890
Well, he was your ally
for 20 years, Leonid.

2385
02:49:47,970 --> 02:49:49,560
Yes, yes, Dick.

2386
02:49:55,110 --> 02:49:57,110
Mr. Nixon...

2387
02:49:58,320 --> 02:50:01,860
Life is the best teacher,
and therefore it must not interfere

2388
02:50:01,950 --> 02:50:05,820
with the building of the S.A.L.T. Two
treaty between our great countries.

2389
02:50:09,160 --> 02:50:12,540
Peace in our era is possible.

2390
02:50:14,250 --> 02:50:18,340
- Excuse me, uh, Leonid.
- It's OK, Dick. It's OK.

2391
02:50:32,180 --> 02:50:35,190
He's spilling his guts to the
Ervin committee. Unfortunately...

2392
02:50:53,410 --> 02:50:54,750
Did you?

2393
02:50:55,540 --> 02:50:58,090
- Daddy?
- What?

2394
02:50:58,170 --> 02:50:59,880
Did you cover it up?

2395
02:51:06,510 --> 02:51:09,220
You think I'd do
something like that, honey?

2396
02:51:12,220 --> 02:51:15,980
Well, then you can't give up.
You just can't.

2397
02:51:16,060 --> 02:51:19,230
You're one of the best presidents
this country has ever had.

2398
02:51:19,310 --> 02:51:23,820
You've done what Lincoln did, brought
this country back from civil war.

2399
02:51:23,900 --> 02:51:26,910
You can't let your enemies
tear you down.

2400
02:51:26,990 --> 02:51:29,450
You've gotta stay and fight.

2401
02:51:29,530 --> 02:51:32,830
I'll go out there and make speeches.
Nobody knows the real you,

2402
02:51:32,910 --> 02:51:36,710
how sweet you are,
how nice you are to people.

2403
02:51:36,790 --> 02:51:39,000
I'll tell them.

2404
02:51:40,750 --> 02:51:43,590
You're the most
decent person I know.

2405
02:51:46,430 --> 02:51:49,050
I just hope I haven't
let you down, Kitten.

2406
02:51:51,010 --> 02:51:53,600
They just don't know
the real you.

2407
02:51:55,230 --> 02:51:57,770
They just don't know.

2408
02:51:57,850 --> 02:52:01,900
Tricky Dick always knew
what was goin' on.

2409
02:52:02,690 --> 02:52:05,820
Every last goddamn detail.

2410
02:52:05,900 --> 02:52:09,780
And my husband is not going
to take the rap this time.

2411
02:52:09,870 --> 02:52:13,950
They know they can't shut me up.
Probably end up killin' me.

2412
02:52:14,040 --> 02:52:17,330
She doesn't know what she's
talking about. Stop bothering her!

2413
02:52:17,410 --> 02:52:19,920
Hell, she's nuts.
You bastards have seen to that.

2414
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:21,460
Will you get together again?

2415
02:52:21,540 --> 02:52:24,960
Our marriage is finished, thank you.
Stick that up your keister!

2416
02:52:31,760 --> 02:52:35,470
Now, were the visitors that
went into the White House warned

2417
02:52:35,560 --> 02:52:39,350
that their conversations with
the president would be taped?

2418
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:41,810
<i>Again, I am not aware
of the technical details.</i>

2419
02:52:41,900 --> 02:52:45,400
On Friday, we have the high
school students from Ohio.

2420
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:49,650
Saturday is the National
Women's Republican Club.

2421
02:52:49,740 --> 02:52:52,280
<i>...Watergate wide open,
former White House aide</i>

2422
02:52:52,370 --> 02:52:56,080
<i>Alexander Butterfield testified
before the Senate Select committee.</i>

2423
02:52:56,160 --> 02:52:59,920
<i>He revealed a taping system
that may have recorded conversations</i>

2424
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,790
<i>in the White House,
the executive office building</i>

2425
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:05,170
<i>and even members of his own family.</i>

2426
02:53:05,250 --> 02:53:08,420
<i>All calls to the White House</i>

2427
02:53:08,510 --> 02:53:11,340
<i>of whatever nature and character,
would be taped?</i>

2428
02:53:11,430 --> 02:53:14,640
<i>- The tape would not discriminate.
- None of them had knowledge</i>

2429
02:53:14,720 --> 02:53:17,140
<i>that their conversations
were being taped?</i>

2430
02:53:17,220 --> 02:53:18,850
<i>This is a stunning revelation.</i>

2431
02:53:18,930 --> 02:53:21,770
<i>If such tapes exist,
they could tell us, once and for all</i>

2432
02:53:21,850 --> 02:53:25,610
<i>what did the president know,
and when did he know it.</i>

2433
02:53:25,690 --> 02:53:25,770
<i>I want Hunt paid.</i>

2434
02:53:25,770 --> 02:53:27,030
<i>I want Hunt paid.</i>

2435
02:53:27,110 --> 02:53:29,320
<i>It's time to go the hang-out route.</i>

2436
02:53:31,030 --> 02:53:34,740
<i>- If they fear the madman...
- It's a legal contribution.</i>

2437
02:53:34,830 --> 02:53:36,790
<i>Who the hell authorized this?</i>

2438
02:53:36,870 --> 02:53:39,700
<i>- I still don't...
- ...the CIA...</i>

2439
02:53:41,210 --> 02:53:44,840
<i>There's a cancer on the presidency,
and it's growing with every day...</i>

2440
02:53:44,920 --> 02:53:46,340
<i>...too damn much...</i>

2441
02:53:47,130 --> 02:53:51,130
<i>If Hunt goes public,
it'll be a fiasco for the C.I.A.</i>

2442
02:53:51,220 --> 02:53:52,800
They're like love letters.

2443
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:57,810
You should burn 'em.

2444
02:53:57,890 --> 02:54:00,520
Why didn't you?

2445
02:54:01,560 --> 02:54:05,060
They're evidence.
You can't legally destroy evidence.

2446
02:54:05,150 --> 02:54:09,190
You don't expect me to believe that
for one minute, do ya?

2447
02:54:11,280 --> 02:54:16,280
Does it matter what's on 'em?
Really? Murder, Dick?

2448
02:54:16,370 --> 02:54:19,740
Sex? Your secrets, your fantasies?

2449
02:54:19,830 --> 02:54:23,500
- Or is just me and you and...
- Don't be ridiculous.

2450
02:54:23,580 --> 02:54:26,500
I remember Alger Hiss.

2451
02:54:26,590 --> 02:54:29,420
I know how ugly you can be.

2452
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:31,720
You're capable of anything.

2453
02:54:39,430 --> 02:54:42,850
See, it doesn't really matter
at the end of the day what's on them

2454
02:54:42,930 --> 02:54:47,980
because you have absolutely no remorse.
No concept of remorse.

2455
02:54:48,060 --> 02:54:52,440
You want the tapes to get out.
You want them to see you at your worst.

2456
02:54:52,530 --> 02:54:54,030
- You're drunk.
- Oh, yeah!

2457
02:54:54,110 --> 02:54:56,780
No one'll ever see those tapes,
including you.

2458
02:54:56,870 --> 02:55:00,040
And what would I find out
that I haven't known for years?

2459
02:55:02,450 --> 02:55:07,580
What makes it so damn sad is that
you couldn't confide in any of us.

2460
02:55:07,670 --> 02:55:10,710
You had to make a record
for the whole world.

2461
02:55:12,460 --> 02:55:17,930
- They were for me. They're mine.
- They're not "yours". They are you.

2462
02:55:25,140 --> 02:55:27,480
You should burn them.

2463
02:55:46,750 --> 02:55:50,170
- What has changed in you, Richard?
- Go away!

2464
02:56:00,180 --> 02:56:04,180
<i>These guys went after Castro
seven times, ten times.</i>

2465
02:56:04,270 --> 02:56:09,270
<i>What, do you think people like that,
just gave up? They just don't walk away.</i>

2466
02:56:14,360 --> 02:56:16,360
<i>- What, do you think?
- I never said this.</i>

2467
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:18,320
<i>- Seven times, ten times.
- Ten times.</i>

2468
02:56:18,410 --> 02:56:21,950
<i>- You think people like that gave up?
- Never.</i>

2469
02:56:22,030 --> 02:56:25,500
<i>Castro. These guys went after Castro.</i>

2470
02:56:30,880 --> 02:56:33,800
<i>If this got out,
they'd blame me for everything.</i>

2471
02:56:33,880 --> 02:56:36,840
<i>Forget Kennedy or Johnson. It's Nixon!</i>

2472
02:56:55,400 --> 02:57:00,160
<i>Whoever killed Kennedy came from
this thing we created, this beast.</i>

2473
02:57:05,870 --> 02:57:09,040
<i>In the latest bombshell,
the president's lawyers revealed</i>

2474
02:57:09,120 --> 02:57:11,370
<i>that there is
an 18-and-a-half-minute gap</i>

2475
02:57:11,460 --> 02:57:13,460
<i>in a critical Watergate tape.</i>

2476
02:57:13,540 --> 02:57:17,920
Reactions of disbelief and anger are
being heard across the country.

2477
02:57:21,550 --> 02:57:23,350
My God.

2478
02:57:23,430 --> 02:57:25,010
Pat!

2479
02:57:26,890 --> 02:57:27,930
Pat!

2480
02:57:28,020 --> 02:57:30,810
- Has he had chest pains?
- He woke up coughing blood!

2481
02:57:30,890 --> 02:57:31,940
I'm in charge here!

2482
02:57:32,020 --> 02:57:33,440
Has he been short of breath?

2483
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:36,400
- No, and he's sure that he has T.B.!
- Why T.B.?

2484
02:57:36,480 --> 02:57:39,400
Because his family had it.
His brother had it.

2485
02:57:42,070 --> 02:57:44,410
<i>- I think it's flooded.
- Richard.</i>

2486
02:57:47,450 --> 02:57:49,750
Get those I.V.s started.

2487
02:57:52,420 --> 02:57:53,710
Please lie down, Dick.

2488
02:57:53,790 --> 02:57:56,210
- They need you to lie down!
- Sedate him!

2489
02:57:56,290 --> 02:57:57,710
Dick. Dick.

2490
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:03,760
<i>Richard?</i>

2491
02:58:05,050 --> 02:58:08,220
<i>- Mother.
- Pretty soon, you boys'll have to...</i>

2492
02:58:08,310 --> 02:58:10,180
Maybe a trip to the woodshed'll...

2493
02:58:11,390 --> 02:58:12,980
<i>Daddy?</i>

2494
02:58:53,350 --> 02:58:57,060
<i>Vice President Agnew
has resigned today pleading no contest</i>

2495
02:58:57,150 --> 02:58:59,480
<i>to charges of income tax evasion.</i>

2496
02:58:59,570 --> 02:59:02,820
<i>This follows Watergate Special
Prosecutor Archibald Cox's</i>

2497
02:59:02,900 --> 02:59:06,610
<i>continuing investigation
into President Nixon's finances.</i>

2498
02:59:06,700 --> 02:59:08,990
<i>The president paid no income tax</i>

2499
02:59:09,080 --> 02:59:12,040
<i>- in 1971 and '72
- They need you to lie down, Dick.</i>

2500
02:59:12,120 --> 02:59:15,920
<i>...and may have used funds to improve
his residence in San Clemente...</i>

2501
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,880
Where's the blood coming from?
What's wrong with him?

2502
02:59:18,960 --> 02:59:22,260
He's got an acute viral pneumonia
and a very serious phlebitis.

2503
02:59:22,340 --> 02:59:25,510
If a clot were to break loose,
it could go into his lungs.

2504
02:59:25,590 --> 02:59:26,800
Oh, no.

2505
02:59:26,890 --> 02:59:29,510
<i>The president has returned
to the White House.</i>

2506
02:59:29,600 --> 02:59:31,180
<i>But Archibald Cox has declared war
by issuing a subpoena</i>

2507
02:59:31,180 --> 02:59:32,600
<i>But Archibald Cox has declared war
by issuing a subpoena</i>

2508
02:59:32,680 --> 02:59:35,850
<i>- for nine of the president's tapes.
- Never! Over my dead body.</i>

2509
02:59:35,940 --> 02:59:38,150
It's the president's personal property.

2510
02:59:38,230 --> 02:59:42,980
I'll never give up my tapes to a bunch
of Kennedy-loving, Democrat cocksuckers.

2511
02:59:43,070 --> 02:59:46,910
This could trigger the impeachment.
They'll go to the Supreme Court.

2512
02:59:46,990 --> 02:59:50,530
I appointed three of those bastards.
I'll never give them my tapes.

2513
02:59:50,620 --> 02:59:53,160
Can the president afford
to ignore a subpoena?

2514
02:59:53,240 --> 02:59:57,170
Who the hell does Cox think he is? I've
never made a dime from public office.

2515
02:59:57,250 --> 03:00:00,340
I'm honest. My dad died broke. Jesus.

2516
03:00:00,420 --> 03:00:04,760
That son of a bitch Cox, he went
to the same law school as Jack Kennedy.

2517
03:00:04,840 --> 03:00:07,510
The last gasp of the establishment.

2518
03:00:07,590 --> 03:00:10,550
Yeah, they got the hell
kicked out of 'em in the election

2519
03:00:10,640 --> 03:00:12,970
so now they gotta squeal
about Watergate

2520
03:00:13,060 --> 03:00:15,980
'cause we were the first
real threat to them in years.

2521
03:00:16,060 --> 03:00:21,560
My God, we would've changed it so they
couldn't have changed it back in years.

2522
03:00:21,650 --> 03:00:22,860
Yeah.

2523
03:00:24,940 --> 03:00:27,650
- If only the, uh...
- Mr. President.

2524
03:00:27,740 --> 03:00:30,450
- Sir, Congress is...
- No, over here, sir.

2525
03:00:30,530 --> 03:00:33,700
Sir, Congress is considering
four articles of impeachment.

2526
03:00:33,790 --> 03:00:37,250
- Yeah. For what?
- They're very serious charges, sir.

2527
03:00:37,330 --> 03:00:39,000
- First, abuse of power.
- Yep.

2528
03:00:39,080 --> 03:00:41,460
- Second, obstruction of justice.
- What else?

2529
03:00:41,540 --> 03:00:44,460
Third, the failure
to cooperate with Congress.

2530
03:00:44,550 --> 03:00:48,220
- And last, bombing Cambodia, sir.
- Can't impeach me for Cambodia.

2531
03:00:48,300 --> 03:00:50,390
The president can bomb anybody he likes.

2532
03:00:50,470 --> 03:00:53,350
- That's true.
- We'll win that, but the other three...

2533
03:00:53,430 --> 03:00:55,600
- Fred, they sell tickets.
- It's Ron, sir.

2534
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:58,560
They sell tickets to an impeachment
like a damn circus.

2535
03:00:58,640 --> 03:01:01,480
OK, so they impeach me.
Well, fuck 'em!

2536
03:01:02,900 --> 03:01:05,690
Yeah, well,
it's just a matter of mathematics.

2537
03:01:05,780 --> 03:01:08,150
How many votes we have in the Senate?

2538
03:01:08,240 --> 03:01:10,490
- About a dozen.
- A dozen?

2539
03:01:10,570 --> 03:01:13,240
Jeez, I got half of 'em elected.

2540
03:01:13,320 --> 03:01:18,250
OK, so I got the South
and Goldwater and his boys.

2541
03:01:19,580 --> 03:01:21,540
I'll take my chances in the Senate.

2542
03:01:21,620 --> 03:01:23,380
- Yes, we should.
- This damn leg.

2543
03:01:23,460 --> 03:01:25,960
Well, then, sir, we'll, uh...

2544
03:01:26,050 --> 03:01:29,380
...have to deal with the possibility
of removal from office,

2545
03:01:29,470 --> 03:01:33,260
loss of pension and possibly...
possibly even prison.

2546
03:01:33,340 --> 03:01:37,020
Yeah, well, plenty of people
did their best writing in prison.

2547
03:01:37,100 --> 03:01:39,930
- Gandhi, Lenin.
- That's right.

2548
03:01:40,020 --> 03:01:42,980
What I know about this country,
I could rip it apart.

2549
03:01:43,060 --> 03:01:46,860
If they want a public humiliation,
that's what they'll get.

2550
03:01:46,940 --> 03:01:50,740
- Yes, they will.
- I'll never resign this office. Never.

2551
03:01:50,820 --> 03:01:54,530
- Where the fuck am I? What's in there?
- The P.O.W.s and their families.

2552
03:01:54,620 --> 03:01:57,540
- I'm supposed to be...
- Compassionate, grateful...

2553
03:01:57,620 --> 03:01:58,750
- Proud.
- Sir?

2554
03:01:58,830 --> 03:02:01,120
- Proud. Of them.
- Oh, yes, of course.

2555
03:02:01,210 --> 03:02:03,630
- Fire him.
- Who?

2556
03:02:03,710 --> 03:02:08,460
- Cox. Archibald Cox. Fire him!
- He works for the attorney general.

2557
03:02:08,550 --> 03:02:11,550
- Only Richardson can fire him.
- May I echo my concern, sir?

2558
03:02:11,630 --> 03:02:16,140
- Then tell Richardson to fire him!
- Well, Richardson won't do that, sir.

2559
03:02:16,220 --> 03:02:18,890
- He'll resign.
- The hell he will. Then fire him too.

2560
03:02:18,970 --> 03:02:22,140
If you have to go down to the janitor
at the justice department

2561
03:02:22,230 --> 03:02:23,810
fire that son of a bitch.

2562
03:02:23,900 --> 03:02:27,440
Mr. President, may I
just say something, sir?

2563
03:02:29,070 --> 03:02:31,570
I think that you should
welcome this subpoena.

2564
03:02:31,650 --> 03:02:33,570
- Why?
- Well, sir,

2565
03:02:33,660 --> 03:02:37,080
the tapes can only prove
that Dean was a liar. Right?

2566
03:02:37,160 --> 03:02:39,580
That's right, sir.

2567
03:02:42,660 --> 03:02:45,000
Well, there's more.

2568
03:02:45,080 --> 03:02:47,170
There's more than just me.

2569
03:02:47,250 --> 03:02:49,840
You can't break, my boy.

2570
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:52,260
Even though it's ended.

2571
03:02:52,340 --> 03:02:55,800
You can't admit,
even to yourself, when it's gone.

2572
03:02:57,010 --> 03:02:59,930
Do you think those P.O.W.s
in there did?

2573
03:03:00,770 --> 03:03:03,350
Now, there's some people,
and we both know them, Al

2574
03:03:03,430 --> 03:03:06,020
think you can go stand
in the middle of a bull ring

2575
03:03:06,100 --> 03:03:07,980
and cry "mea culpa, mea culpa,"

2576
03:03:08,060 --> 03:03:12,280
while the crowd is hissing
and booing and spitting on you.

2577
03:03:13,110 --> 03:03:16,950
Well, a man doesn't cry. I don't cry.

2578
03:03:17,700 --> 03:03:20,950
You don't cry. You fight.

2579
03:03:24,790 --> 03:03:26,040
OK.

2580
03:03:26,120 --> 03:03:30,380
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States!

2581
03:03:35,380 --> 03:03:39,470
<i>Good evening. We interrupt this program
for a special report from NBC news.</i>

2582
03:03:39,550 --> 03:03:41,220
<i>The country is in the midst</i>

2583
03:03:41,310 --> 03:03:45,230
<i>of what may be the most serious
constitutional crisis in its history.</i>

2584
03:03:45,310 --> 03:03:49,150
<i>President Nixon has fired special
prosecutor Archibald Cox.</i>

2585
03:03:49,230 --> 03:03:51,650
<i>Attorney General Elliot Richardson
has quit</i>

2586
03:03:51,730 --> 03:03:55,530
<i>and his deputy William Ruckelshaus
was fired when he refused to fire Cox.</i>

2587
03:03:55,610 --> 03:03:58,530
<i>Attorney General Robert Bork
executed Nixon's orders,</i>

2588
03:03:58,610 --> 03:04:01,870
<i>- fired the prosecutor.
- ...to head off impeachment proceedings</i>

2589
03:04:01,950 --> 03:04:05,870
<i>the president has agreed to release
transcripts of 46 taped conversations.</i>

2590
03:04:05,960 --> 03:04:09,250
<i>In a simple ceremony, Gerald
Ford was sworn in as vice president.</i>

2591
03:04:09,330 --> 03:04:13,920
<i>Citing wrongdoing, a judge has dismissed
all charges against Daniel Ellsberg.</i>

2592
03:04:14,010 --> 03:04:17,680
<i>A grand jury has indicted former
Nixon aides Haldeman, Ehrlichman...</i>

2593
03:04:17,760 --> 03:04:21,260
You're a lawyer, for God's sake.
How can you let this shit go through?

2594
03:04:21,350 --> 03:04:24,470
- Look. This. Nixon can't say that.
- Well, you did say it, sir.

2595
03:04:24,560 --> 03:04:26,770
Never! I never
said that about Jews.

2596
03:04:26,850 --> 03:04:30,270
- Makes me sound like an anti-Semite.
- We can check the tapes again.

2597
03:04:30,350 --> 03:04:34,940
No need. I know what I said.
Have you lost your mind? Look, Al!

2598
03:04:35,030 --> 03:04:38,820
Nixon can't say this!
"Niggers. Niggers." It can't say that!

2599
03:04:38,910 --> 03:04:41,450
- We could delete it.
- We're doing the best we can.

2600
03:04:41,530 --> 03:04:44,580
- It's not good enough!
- Would you have us black it out, sir?

2601
03:04:44,660 --> 03:04:48,790
- We could write "expletive deleted."
- Cut all these "goddamns"

2602
03:04:48,870 --> 03:04:51,960
and "Jesus Christs" out. Jesus.

2603
03:04:52,040 --> 03:04:56,340
Mr. President. Don't you see that all
these deletion marks in the transcripts

2604
03:04:56,420 --> 03:04:59,880
make it look as though you...
you do nothing but swear?

2605
03:05:04,010 --> 03:05:06,270
It soils my mother's memory.

2606
03:05:06,350 --> 03:05:10,310
You think I want the whole goddamn
world to see my mother like this?

2607
03:05:10,390 --> 03:05:12,730
Raising a dirty-mouth?

2608
03:05:12,810 --> 03:05:17,150
We could start again, sir, but we
don't really have the staff to do that.

2609
03:05:17,240 --> 03:05:20,490
Then start over! Just start over!

2610
03:05:20,570 --> 03:05:23,660
The world will see only what I show 'em!

2611
03:05:23,740 --> 03:05:26,450
From page one, Al. Page one, Ron!

2612
03:05:26,540 --> 03:05:28,960
Ron, get in there and do something.

2613
03:05:29,040 --> 03:05:31,210
All this stuff.

2614
03:05:37,590 --> 03:05:40,300
Five seconds, Mr. President.

2615
03:05:40,380 --> 03:05:44,760
And four, three, two...

2616
03:05:49,850 --> 03:05:52,900
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

2617
03:05:52,980 --> 03:05:54,940
Tonight I'm taking an action

2618
03:05:55,020 --> 03:05:57,860
unprecedented in the history
of this office.

2619
03:05:57,940 --> 03:06:01,530
<i>I had no knowledge of the cover-up
till John Dean told me about it</i>

2620
03:06:01,610 --> 03:06:04,490
<i>- on March 21st, a year ago.
- I think I'm going to throw up.</i>

2621
03:06:04,570 --> 03:06:06,830
<i>...no payment to Hunt
or anyone else be made.</i>

2622
03:06:06,910 --> 03:06:11,370
<i>- He's lost touch with reality.
- I've made my mistakes,</i>

2623
03:06:11,460 --> 03:06:14,830
<i>but in all my years of public life,
I have never profited.</i>

2624
03:06:14,920 --> 03:06:18,250
Can you imagine
what this man would have been

2625
03:06:18,340 --> 03:06:21,220
<i>- had he ever been loved?
- I've earned every penny.</i>

2626
03:06:21,300 --> 03:06:25,010
<i>In all of my years of public life
I have never obstructed justice.</i>

2627
03:06:25,090 --> 03:06:28,560
It's a tragedy
because he had greatness in his grasp.

2628
03:06:28,640 --> 03:06:32,230
<i>- I welcome this examination.
- But had the defects of his qualities.</i>

2629
03:06:32,310 --> 03:06:35,060
<i>- I made $250,000...
- They'll crucify him.</i>

2630
03:06:35,150 --> 03:06:37,270
Does anybody
really care anymore?

2631
03:06:37,360 --> 03:06:40,030
<i>...which many of you
were good enough to purchase.</i>

2632
03:06:41,570 --> 03:06:44,910
And what happens after?

2633
03:06:44,990 --> 03:06:46,740
<i>...every year.</i>

2634
03:06:48,160 --> 03:06:51,870
<i>When l, in 1968 decided to become
a candidate for the president,</i>

2635
03:06:51,950 --> 03:06:56,580
<i>I decided to clean the decks
and to put everything in real estate.</i>

2636
03:06:56,670 --> 03:07:00,420
<i>So, that's where the money came from.
That's all I own.</i>

2637
03:07:00,500 --> 03:07:03,510
<i>That's what we have,
and that's what we owe.</i>

2638
03:07:03,590 --> 03:07:06,840
<i>Because people have got to know
whether or not their president...</i>

2639
03:07:06,930 --> 03:07:08,930
<i>...their president is a crook.</i>

2640
03:07:09,010 --> 03:07:12,850
<i>Well, l am not a crook.
I've earned everything I have</i>

2641
03:07:12,930 --> 03:07:14,560
<i>...doesn't have a mink coat.</i>

2642
03:07:14,640 --> 03:07:17,520
<i>She does have a respectable
Republican cloth coat.</i>

2643
03:07:17,610 --> 03:07:20,940
<i>And I always tell her
she'd look good in anything.</i>

2644
03:07:21,030 --> 03:07:26,860
<i>There has never been any feathering
of nests. Not in this administration.</i>

2645
03:07:27,620 --> 03:07:29,330
<i>Now, let me just say this.</i>

2646
03:07:29,410 --> 03:07:32,450
<i>And I want to say this
to the television audience...</i>

2647
03:07:32,540 --> 03:07:35,790
<i>Supreme Court ruled today
eight to nothing that Nixon's claims</i>

2648
03:07:35,870 --> 03:07:38,710
<i>of executive privilege
cannot be used in criminal cases</i>

2649
03:07:38,790 --> 03:07:42,300
<i>- and must turn over subpoenaed tapes.
- The House Judiciary Committee</i>

2650
03:07:42,380 --> 03:07:44,300
<i>has voted 27 to 11</i>

2651
03:07:44,380 --> 03:07:47,050
<i>to recommend impeachment
to the House.</i>

2652
03:07:47,130 --> 03:07:49,800
<i>The deliberations
now go to the House floor.</i>

2653
03:07:49,890 --> 03:07:53,640
<i>In its report, the committee offers
evidence Nixon obstructed justice</i>

2654
03:07:53,720 --> 03:07:57,770
<i>on at least 36 occasions, that he
encouraged his aides to commit perjury</i>

2655
03:07:57,850 --> 03:08:00,980
<i>and that Nixon abused
the powers of his office.</i>

2656
03:08:01,070 --> 03:08:03,650
<i>In a separate report,
the Senate Select committee</i>

2657
03:08:03,730 --> 03:08:07,570
<i>details the misuse of the l.R.S.,
the F.B.l., the C.l.A.</i>

2658
03:08:07,660 --> 03:08:09,660
<i>and the justice department.</i>

2659
03:08:09,740 --> 03:08:12,490
<i>It denounces the plumbers
and it raises the question</i>

2660
03:08:12,580 --> 03:08:17,370
<i>of whether the United States
had a valid election in 1972.</i>

2661
03:08:31,010 --> 03:08:32,430
Come in.

2662
03:08:44,440 --> 03:08:49,740
Victory at Sea, Al. Henry.
The Pacific Theatre.

2663
03:08:49,820 --> 03:08:53,910
Christ, you can almost hear the waves
breaking over the decks.

2664
03:08:59,500 --> 03:09:02,330
I'm afraid we have another problem,
Mr. President.

2665
03:09:03,170 --> 03:09:04,960
Excuse me, gentlemen.

2666
03:09:09,590 --> 03:09:12,140
June 23rd, '72, sir.

2667
03:09:14,810 --> 03:09:19,270
Your instructions to Haldeman
regarding the C.I.A. and the F.B.I.

2668
03:09:20,520 --> 03:09:22,060
So?

2669
03:09:22,150 --> 03:09:26,900
Your lawyers feel that
it's the smoking gun.

2670
03:09:26,980 --> 03:09:30,240
Totally out of context.
I was protecting the national security.

2671
03:09:30,320 --> 03:09:32,910
Sir, the deadline is today.

2672
03:09:36,080 --> 03:09:38,040
Can we get around this, Al?

2673
03:09:39,370 --> 03:09:43,920
It's the Supreme Court, sir.
You don't get around it.

2674
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:49,880
If, uh...

2675
03:09:49,970 --> 03:09:54,260
If you resign, you can keep your tapes
as a private citizen.

2676
03:09:54,350 --> 03:09:56,970
You could fight them for years.

2677
03:09:59,850 --> 03:10:01,770
What if I stay?

2678
03:10:04,690 --> 03:10:07,270
You have the army.

2679
03:10:07,360 --> 03:10:08,940
The army?

2680
03:10:10,900 --> 03:10:12,360
Lincoln used it.

2681
03:10:19,200 --> 03:10:20,700
That was civil war.

2682
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:23,370
How do you see this?

2683
03:10:27,130 --> 03:10:28,460
Oh, God.

2684
03:10:28,550 --> 03:10:31,590
We can't survive this, sir.

2685
03:10:34,550 --> 03:10:39,220
They also have you instructing Dean
to make the pay off to Hunt.

2686
03:10:39,310 --> 03:10:43,390
There's nothing in that statement
the president can't explain.

2687
03:10:43,480 --> 03:10:48,980
Sir, you talked about opening up
the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.

2688
03:10:49,070 --> 03:10:52,150
- That's right.
- Three days before, the June 20th tape.

2689
03:10:52,240 --> 03:10:55,950
- The one with the 18-minute gap.
- I don't know anything about that.

2690
03:10:56,030 --> 03:10:59,160
You mentioned
the Bay of Pigs several times.

2691
03:10:59,240 --> 03:11:03,290
Sooner or later, they're going to
want to know what that means.

2692
03:11:03,370 --> 03:11:06,290
They're going to want to
know what's on that gap.

2693
03:11:06,380 --> 03:11:09,630
It's gone. No one will
ever find out what's on it.

2694
03:11:12,380 --> 03:11:16,510
They might if there was
another recording.

2695
03:11:18,850 --> 03:11:20,760
We both know it's possible.

2696
03:11:25,520 --> 03:11:29,190
I know for a fact
that it's possible.

2697
03:11:32,280 --> 03:11:33,740
I've spoken to Ford.

2698
03:11:33,820 --> 03:11:38,660
There's a very strong chance
that he'll pardon you.

2699
03:11:38,740 --> 03:11:42,580
I don't need a goddamned deal,
for God's sake. I...

2700
03:11:42,660 --> 03:11:47,670
This is something that
you will have to do, Mr. President.

2701
03:11:49,710 --> 03:11:54,130
I thought you'd rather do it now.

2702
03:11:58,640 --> 03:12:00,640
I'll wait outside.

2703
03:12:05,890 --> 03:12:07,650
Sir.

2704
03:12:08,810 --> 03:12:12,230
May I say, sir, that if you stay now,

2705
03:12:12,320 --> 03:12:16,570
it will paralyze the nation
and its foreign policy.

2706
03:12:20,160 --> 03:12:23,490
You always had a great
sense of timing, Henry.

2707
03:12:23,580 --> 03:12:27,370
When to give and when to take.

2708
03:12:30,460 --> 03:12:34,210
How do you think Mao
and Brezhnev will react?

2709
03:12:34,300 --> 03:12:37,590
Do you think they'll
remember us, Henry,

2710
03:12:37,680 --> 03:12:40,390
after all the great things
you and I did together,

2711
03:12:40,470 --> 03:12:45,310
as some kind of...
of crooks?

2712
03:12:45,390 --> 03:12:50,100
They will understand.
To be undone by a third-rate burglary

2713
03:12:50,190 --> 03:12:53,190
is a fate of biblical proportions.

2714
03:12:55,400 --> 03:12:59,280
History will treat you far more
kindly than your contemporaries.

2715
03:12:59,360 --> 03:13:01,120
Yeah.

2716
03:13:01,200 --> 03:13:04,990
Depends who writes the history books.

2717
03:13:05,080 --> 03:13:08,540
I'm not a quitter, never have been.

2718
03:13:08,620 --> 03:13:11,540
But I'm not stupid either.

2719
03:13:11,630 --> 03:13:15,130
A trial would kill me.
That's what they want.

2720
03:13:15,210 --> 03:13:19,220
They won't get it. Fuck 'em.

2721
03:13:41,530 --> 03:13:45,620
If they harass you, I too will resign,
and I will tell the world why.

2722
03:13:45,700 --> 03:13:49,540
Don't be stupid.
The world needs you, Henry.

2723
03:13:51,080 --> 03:13:53,540
You always saw the big picture.

2724
03:13:57,090 --> 03:14:00,010
You were my equal in many ways.

2725
03:14:09,350 --> 03:14:12,310
You're the only friend I got, Henry.

2726
03:14:14,940 --> 03:14:17,270
Do you ever pray?

2727
03:14:18,440 --> 03:14:23,780
You know, believe in a supreme being?

2728
03:14:25,490 --> 03:14:29,700
Not really.
You mean on my knees?

2729
03:14:33,710 --> 03:14:37,290
My mother used to pray a lot.

2730
03:14:37,380 --> 03:14:42,300
It's been a long time
since I really prayed.

2731
03:14:48,060 --> 03:14:50,890
Let's pray, Henry.

2732
03:14:50,970 --> 03:14:55,480
Let's pray a little.
Just you and me.

2733
03:15:03,610 --> 03:15:06,410
I hope this doesn't embarrass you,
Henry.

2734
03:15:06,490 --> 03:15:09,330
No. Not at all, no.

2735
03:15:09,410 --> 03:15:13,500
This is not going to leak, is it?

2736
03:15:15,960 --> 03:15:19,000
Don't be too proud, Henry.

2737
03:15:19,090 --> 03:15:23,760
Never be too proud
to go on your knees before God.

2738
03:15:35,690 --> 03:15:38,690
God.

2739
03:15:44,650 --> 03:15:46,610
How can a...

2740
03:15:46,700 --> 03:15:50,280
How can a country come apart like this?

2741
03:15:50,370 --> 03:15:53,370
What have I done wrong?

2742
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:59,540
I opened China.
I made peace with Russia.

2743
03:16:00,790 --> 03:16:03,880
I ended the war.

2744
03:16:05,550 --> 03:16:08,340
I did what I thought was right.

2745
03:16:13,560 --> 03:16:16,270
God, why do they hate me so?

2746
03:16:16,350 --> 03:16:20,480
It's unbelievable. It... It's insane.

2747
03:16:21,900 --> 03:16:27,320
Oh, Mom, I'm sorry. God, please
forgive me, God. I didn't mean it.

2748
03:16:27,400 --> 03:16:31,070
I never wanted to do...
I don't want this to... Is it me?

2749
03:16:31,160 --> 03:16:34,910
Is this happening?
I can't believe...

2750
03:16:40,750 --> 03:16:42,590
Al.

2751
03:16:58,060 --> 03:17:03,520
They smelled the blood on me
this time, Al. I got soft, you know?

2752
03:17:04,400 --> 03:17:07,860
A rusty, metallic smell.

2753
03:17:07,950 --> 03:17:12,570
- I know it well, sir.
- It came over from Vietnam, you know?

2754
03:17:12,660 --> 03:17:15,200
- Sir?
- That smell.

2755
03:17:16,330 --> 03:17:19,250
I mean, everyone suffered so much.

2756
03:17:19,330 --> 03:17:22,460
Their boys killed.

2757
03:17:22,540 --> 03:17:26,260
They need to sacrifice something.

2758
03:17:26,340 --> 03:17:29,260
You know, appease the gods of war.

2759
03:17:30,130 --> 03:17:33,260
Mars, Jupiter.

2760
03:17:36,350 --> 03:17:39,430
I am that blood, General.

2761
03:17:41,440 --> 03:17:44,230
I am that sacrifice.

2762
03:17:45,020 --> 03:17:47,780
In the highest place of all.

2763
03:17:51,240 --> 03:17:55,410
Yeah. All leaders
must finally be sacrificed.

2764
03:17:56,660 --> 03:17:59,580
Things won't be the same after this.

2765
03:17:59,660 --> 03:18:05,380
No, I played by the rules. Rules changed
right in the middle of the game.

2766
03:18:05,460 --> 03:18:09,170
There's no respect for American
institutions anymore.

2767
03:18:10,920 --> 03:18:13,930
No, people are cynical.

2768
03:18:14,010 --> 03:18:17,680
The press, ah,
the press is out of control.

2769
03:18:19,140 --> 03:18:22,440
People spit on soldiers.

2770
03:18:22,520 --> 03:18:25,060
Government secrets mean nothing.

2771
03:18:26,520 --> 03:18:29,690
I pity the next guy who sits here.

2772
03:18:32,530 --> 03:18:34,700
Good night, gentlemen.

2773
03:18:40,620 --> 03:18:43,170
Mr. President.

2774
03:19:19,660 --> 03:19:24,580
When they look at you,
they see what they want to be.

2775
03:19:27,330 --> 03:19:32,340
When they look at me,
they see what they are.

2776
03:19:37,680 --> 03:19:40,810
Dick, please don't.

2777
03:19:47,350 --> 03:19:49,480
I can't.

2778
03:19:49,560 --> 03:19:52,570
I don't have the strength anymore.

2779
03:19:54,030 --> 03:19:56,200
It'll be over soon.

2780
03:19:56,280 --> 03:19:59,450
No, it's going to start now.

2781
03:20:00,450 --> 03:20:05,500
Oh, Buddy.
If I could just sleep.

2782
03:20:05,580 --> 03:20:08,960
- If I could just sleep.
- There'll be time for that.

2783
03:20:09,040 --> 03:20:10,880
Yeah.

2784
03:20:15,380 --> 03:20:20,220
You know, once when I was sick as a boy,

2785
03:20:20,300 --> 03:20:25,310
my mother gave me this stuff
and she made me swallow it.

2786
03:20:26,730 --> 03:20:29,940
It made me throw up all over her.

2787
03:20:32,070 --> 03:20:35,610
I wish I could do that now.

2788
03:20:41,530 --> 03:20:44,290
I'm so afraid.

2789
03:20:44,950 --> 03:20:47,750
There's darkness out there.

2790
03:20:49,540 --> 03:20:54,840
I could always see where I was going.
But it's dark out there.

2791
03:20:57,170 --> 03:21:01,430
God, I've always
been afraid of the dark.

2792
03:21:03,010 --> 03:21:05,020
Buddy.

2793
03:21:32,040 --> 03:21:32,120
There are many fine careers.
This country needs good farmers,

2794
03:21:32,130 --> 03:21:37,590
There are many fine careers.
This country needs good farmers,

2795
03:21:37,670 --> 03:21:42,640
good businessmen, good plumbers

2796
03:21:42,720 --> 03:21:45,810
good carpenters.

2797
03:21:45,890 --> 03:21:49,390
I remember my old man.

2798
03:21:49,480 --> 03:21:53,060
I think that they would
have called him sort of a,

2799
03:21:53,150 --> 03:21:56,110
sort of a little man, a common man.

2800
03:21:56,190 --> 03:22:01,950
Well, he didn't consider
himself that way.

2801
03:22:02,030 --> 03:22:06,620
You know what he was?
He was a streetcar motorman first.

2802
03:22:06,700 --> 03:22:10,290
Then he was a farmer.

2803
03:22:10,370 --> 03:22:12,330
Then he had a lemon ranch.

2804
03:22:12,420 --> 03:22:16,170
It was the poorest lemon ranch
in California, I can assure you.

2805
03:22:16,250 --> 03:22:19,300
He sold it before they found oil on it.

2806
03:22:22,380 --> 03:22:25,010
Then he was a grocer.

2807
03:22:25,100 --> 03:22:27,600
But he was a great man

2808
03:22:27,680 --> 03:22:30,980
because he did his job.

2809
03:22:31,060 --> 03:22:34,230
And every job counts up to the hilt

2810
03:22:34,310 --> 03:22:36,900
regardless of what happens.

2811
03:22:38,280 --> 03:22:41,780
Nobody will ever write a book,
probably, about my mother.

2812
03:22:41,860 --> 03:22:47,870
Well, I guess all of you would
say this about your mother.

2813
03:22:49,540 --> 03:22:52,910
My mother was a saint.

2814
03:22:53,000 --> 03:22:58,550
And I think of her
two boys dying of tuberculosis

2815
03:22:58,630 --> 03:23:03,430
and seeing each of them die.
And when they died...

2816
03:23:07,890 --> 03:23:13,480
Yes, she will have no books
written about her.

2817
03:23:14,810 --> 03:23:18,400
But she was a saint.

2818
03:23:19,440 --> 03:23:23,400
Now, however, we look to the future.

2819
03:23:23,490 --> 03:23:27,700
I remember something, uh,
Theodore Roosevelt wrote

2820
03:23:27,780 --> 03:23:31,950
when his first wife died
in his twenties.

2821
03:23:32,040 --> 03:23:35,750
He thought the light had gone
from his life forever.

2822
03:23:35,830 --> 03:23:39,420
But he went on, and he not
only became president

2823
03:23:39,500 --> 03:23:42,300
but as an ex-president,
he served his country

2824
03:23:42,380 --> 03:23:46,430
always in the arena,
tempestuous, strong,

2825
03:23:46,510 --> 03:23:49,050
sometimes right, sometimes wrong.

2826
03:23:49,140 --> 03:23:52,310
But he was a man.

2827
03:23:52,390 --> 03:23:58,020
And as I leave that's an example
I think all of us should remember.

2828
03:23:58,100 --> 03:24:03,740
See, we think sometimes when, things
happen that don't go the right way;

2829
03:24:03,820 --> 03:24:07,610
we think that when someone
dear to us dies,

2830
03:24:07,700 --> 03:24:10,530
when we lose an election,

2831
03:24:10,620 --> 03:24:14,290
or when we suffer defeat
that all is ended.

2832
03:24:14,370 --> 03:24:19,330
Not true.
It's only a beginning, always,

2833
03:24:19,420 --> 03:24:23,630
because the greatness comes,
not when things go always good for you,

2834
03:24:23,710 --> 03:24:27,680
but the greatness comes
when you're really tested,

2835
03:24:27,760 --> 03:24:31,470
when you take some knocks,
some disappointments

2836
03:24:31,550 --> 03:24:33,640
when sadness comes.

2837
03:24:33,720 --> 03:24:37,810
Because only if you've been
in the deepest valley

2838
03:24:37,890 --> 03:24:43,480
can you ever know
how magnificent it is

2839
03:24:43,570 --> 03:24:45,820
to be on the highest mountain.

2840
03:24:49,410 --> 03:24:52,700
So, I say to you on this occasion,

2841
03:24:52,780 --> 03:24:57,160
we leave, proud of the people
who have stood by us and worked for us

2842
03:24:57,250 --> 03:25:00,710
and served this government
and this country.

2843
03:25:00,790 --> 03:25:03,590
They want you to continue
to serve in government

2844
03:25:03,670 --> 03:25:05,800
if that is what you wish.

2845
03:25:05,880 --> 03:25:09,380
Remember, always give your best.

2846
03:25:09,470 --> 03:25:13,720
Never get discouraged.
Never be petty.

2847
03:25:13,810 --> 03:25:17,390
Always remember, others may hate you.

2848
03:25:17,480 --> 03:25:21,730
But those who hate you don't win
unless you hate them.

2849
03:25:21,810 --> 03:25:26,480
And then, you destroy yourself.

2850
03:25:26,570 --> 03:25:32,280
And so we leave with high hopes
and good spirits and with deep humility.

2851
03:25:32,370 --> 03:25:34,490
And I say to each
and every one of you,

2852
03:25:34,580 --> 03:25:36,950
not only will we always remember you

2853
03:25:37,040 --> 03:25:42,290
but always, you will be
in our hearts.

2854
03:25:42,380 --> 03:25:46,960
And you'll be in our prayers.

2855
03:25:47,050 --> 03:25:53,050
And only then will you find what
we Quakers call "peace at the center".

2856
03:26:07,820 --> 03:26:13,780
He gave of himself with intelligence
and energy and devotion to duty.

2857
03:26:13,870 --> 03:26:19,700
<i>Richard Nixon was buried and honored
by five presidents on April 26, 1994.</i>

2858
03:26:19,790 --> 03:26:24,580
<i>Less than a year after his beloved wife,
Pat, had died.</i>

2859
03:26:24,670 --> 03:26:28,460
<i>Nixon always maintained that
if he had not been driven from office</i>

2860
03:26:28,550 --> 03:26:33,800
<i>the North Vietnamese would not have
overwhelmed the South in 1975.</i>

2861
03:26:33,890 --> 03:26:38,560
<i>In a sideshow, Cambodian society was
destroyed and mass genocide resulted.</i>

2862
03:26:38,640 --> 03:26:43,270
The second half of the 20th century
will be known as the age of Nixon.

2863
03:26:43,350 --> 03:26:46,860
<i>ln his absence, Russia and the
United States returned to a decade</i>

2864
03:26:46,940 --> 03:26:49,610
<i>of high-budget military expansion
and near war.</i>

2865
03:26:50,530 --> 03:26:53,570
<i>Nixon, who was pardoned
by President Ford,</i>

2866
03:26:53,660 --> 03:26:59,240
<i>lived to write six books and travel
the world as an elder statesman.</i>

2867
03:26:59,330 --> 03:27:04,370
<i>For the remainder of his life, he fought
successfully to protect his tapes.</i>

2868
03:27:04,460 --> 03:27:09,250
<i>The National Archives spent
14 years indexing and cataloging them.</i>

2869
03:27:09,340 --> 03:27:13,800
<i>Out of 4,000 hours,
60 hours have been made public.</i>

2870
03:30:15,800 --> 03:30:15,800
