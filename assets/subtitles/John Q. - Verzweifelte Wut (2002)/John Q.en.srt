1
00:01:45,183 --> 00:01:46,216
Come on.

2
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:59,747
The problem is,
our economy is slowing down.

3
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:02,589
You all know that
as well as anybody does.

4
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,425
I bet you've got friends and maybe
yourself understand what it means

5
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:10,302
to have credit card debt, and when
you couple that with high energy bills,

6
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:13,011
there are some people
beginning to feel pinched.

7
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:15,272
It makes sense.
To take control...

8
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,516
John?

9
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,150
Honey, what's wrong?

10
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:27,035
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like?

11
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:29,914
- That's my car.
- That's not what the bank says.

12
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,958
- Come on!
- Try paying your bills.

13
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:57,232
What's going on?

14
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:08,784
I'm sorry. I talked to the bank.
They promised they'd work with me.

15
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:13,290
- John, that was two months ago.
- We're down to one last month's rent.

16
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:15,908
It's either the car
or the house, so I thought...

17
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:19,415
- You thought.
- You want them to throw us out?

18
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:23,380
I'm down to 20 hours at the plant.
They're shipping all the jobs to Mexico.

19
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,548
- What do you want me to do?
- John, my car is gone.

20
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:30,548
I understand. Now you see I'm trying
to find a second job, baby.

21
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:34,053
You want me to say it's fine?
All right, it's fine.

22
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:37,562
The car is still ours. We own it.

23
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:41,026
I got to wait for my next cheque.
In two weeks, we'll be fine.

24
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:42,862
Mikey!

25
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,155
Yeah! Ronnie Coleman.

26
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:52,153
Mr Olympia two year running.

27
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,201
- Sit down. Eat breakfast.
- I am eating.

28
00:04:57,336 --> 00:05:00,254
- A doughnut isn't breakfast.
- It's the continental breakfast.

29
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,509
- We're not on a continent right now.
- Dad, what do you call North America?

30
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:07,043
You're not going to school
till you eat breakfast, so eat.

31
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:08,673
Both of you.

32
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:14,928
I can't believe those jerks took our car.
Can you, Mom?

33
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:17,979
- No, I can't.
- What are we going to do?

34
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:22,318
You're going to do something, right, Dad?
You know what I'd do?

35
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:26,063
I'd get so big and mad,
I'd go crazy and kick someone's butt.

36
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,610
- Watch your language.
- I would.

37
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:30,068
You been watching
too much WW Wrestling.

38
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:34,283
Not wrestling, Dad. Bodybuilding.
There's a big difference.

39
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:36,988
Get your books.
You're going to be late.

40
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:40,082
Hurry up, baby.

41
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:48,630
Can I get a ride to work?

42
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:10,066
п I love you ап

43
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:13,866
п Oh, you know I really do ап

44
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:18,457
- All right, all right. I got a good one.
- ап If I ever seen a girl ап

45
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:20,707
п That... ап
Go ahead.

46
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:24,288
п That you needed ап
Go ahead.

47
00:06:24,424 --> 00:06:27,044
- Radishes.
- No, it's...

48
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:29,005
Reddish stick.

49
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:30,965
- I swear.
- It's "radio station."

50
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:34,133
Radio station. Okay.
That's a good one. You got me.

51
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:42,763
Honey?

52
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:48,489
- Hundred dollars?
- No, we talked about it this morning.

53
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:53,070
- Continent.
- Continent.

54
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:56,203
- Got you, right? Mom?
- How about you, Mom?

55
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,291
- Come on, baby.
- You just laugh at me.

56
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:05,080
- I don't like it. I'm no good at it.
- All right, something in the car.

57
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:07,338
- We won't laugh.
- We won't laugh.

58
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,797
Please?

59
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:14,301
- All right.
- We can't know what you're saying.

60
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:20,473
What? What did you say?

61
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,561
I said...

62
00:07:28,488 --> 00:07:29,520
What?

63
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:37,738
- Come get this woman, please.
- What, it's no good?

64
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:43,460
Come on. Come on, baby.
I'll thumb-wrestle you.

65
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,546
- All right.
- One, two, three.

66
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:53,053
- One, two, three. She wins.
- You got it.

67
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:55,219
I am queen.

68
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:59,883
- All right, I got one.
- I got one for you. You're going to school.

69
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:03,147
Get your lunch.

70
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:18,204
Dad, I got $46
I saved from my allowance.

71
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:20,785
- You can have it if you want.
- Yeah?

72
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,834
We're a family.
We got to stick together, right?

73
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:28,089
That's right. But you earned
that money, so you keep it, okay?

74
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,254
All right. See you later.

75
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:35,969
- Bye, Mike.
- Not good-bye. I hate good-bye.

76
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:40,143
- Remember? "See you later."
- All right, see you later.

77
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:50,067
Flex Wheeler...
275 pounds, 2% body fat.

78
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,695
Yeah, baby.

79
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:36,325
- John! You take my grinding wheel?
- What?

80
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,244
My grinding wheel!

81
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,079
- I do, don't I?
- You do?

82
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:43,409
- Yeah, I have sex appeal.
- No, it's not in my locker.

83
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:45,867
- My grinding wheel.
- Do you want mine?

84
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,957
Only two people know
the combination to my locker.

85
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,496
That's my grinder and you know it.

86
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:55,134
- John! Smoke, all right?
- All right.

87
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:03,303
- What's with the tie? Somebody die?
- You like that?

88
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:06,936
That's the tie I'm wearing to my funeral
if I don't get this job at Otisville today.

89
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,600
- There are no jobs.
- I saw it in the classifieds. They're hiring.

90
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,894
- Forget about it.
- I got to go, though.

91
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,613
- How come?
- They repo'd our car this morning.

92
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:18,118
Oh, boy.

93
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:21,070
- You want me to go with you?
- Come on.

94
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:29,121
Fifty cents!
This is a frigging waste of time.

95
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,090
Four hundred people for one job?
Give me a break.

96
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:37,215
Guaranteed somebody's son, cousin,
uncle already got this job sewn up.

97
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:39,672
Why did they put it in the paper
if they're not hiring?

98
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:41,765
It's a frigging run-around.
Mark my words.

99
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:46,388
It's either, "We'll keep your application
on file" or, "You're overqualified."

100
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:50,727
- Either way, they screw you.
- Archibald!

101
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:59,660
I've been working heavy machinery
for 15 years.

102
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:04,078
I really want the job.
Anything you want, I can do.

103
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:08,667
- I see.
- I can start today if you need.

104
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:15,582
Your rжsumж is very impressive.
You've certainly got the experience.

105
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:21,051
Frankly, you may be overqualified.

106
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:23,553
We'll keep your application on file.

107
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,474
п Jesus loves me, this I know ап

108
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:35,898
п For the Bible tells... ап

109
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:40,573
Dad, the game starts in 15 minutes.
We're going to be late.

110
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:44,070
п... to him belong ап

111
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:50,078
п They are weak, but he is strong ап

112
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:55,798
п Yes, Jesus loves me ап

113
00:11:55,925 --> 00:12:01,050
п The Bible tells me so ап

114
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:08,766
Knock it out, baby!
Come on! To the fence!

115
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:11,139
Come on, Tommy!

116
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:17,608
Ball four!

117
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:23,775
Go, Mikey!

118
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:29,042
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, son. All right.

119
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:31,705
- Come on, boy!
- Knock it out!

120
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:36,083
- Keep your head down on the ball, son.
- Knock it out for your mama, baby.

121
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:37,379
Come on, Mikey!

122
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,712
- Sometime today, pitcher.
- There you go.

123
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:46,092
- Strike!
- Don't worry about it, son.

124
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:48,800
- You blind?
- Keep your head down on the ball!

125
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:51,689
- I hate this pitcher. How old is he?
- He's supposed to be twelve.

126
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:56,061
Twelve, my ass. Look at him.
His beard grew an inch between pitches.

127
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:59,148
- For your mama, baby.
- Put your elbow up, son.

128
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:04,069
- Go, baby!
- There you go, baby!

129
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:05,198
Safe!

130
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:08,116
- Safe?
- Tie goes to the runner.

131
00:13:11,418 --> 00:13:13,126
Run!

132
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,545
Second base!

133
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:34,268
- Michael?
- Mikey, baby.

134
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,190
Somebody call an ambulance!

135
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:40,517
Somebody call
a frigging ambulance!

136
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:46,406
- Get the door!
- Get the door, Jimmy.

137
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:49,110
- Got it. Come on, let's go!
- It's going to be okay.

138
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,076
- Take him, baby.
- Give him to me.

139
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:59,920
It's Mama. Come on, Mikey.
We got to get out of here. Go!

140
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:32,495
- Help us!
- Help! Please, somebody.

141
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,079
- Calm down.
- He's not breathing.

142
00:14:35,211 --> 00:14:36,703
All right, come with me.

143
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:40,422
He was just playing baseball,
running to second base.

144
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:44,131
- I don't know what happened.
- I need a doctor right away, please!

145
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,334
No. Jesus.

146
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:49,053
- What happened?
- He collapsed playing baseball.

147
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:51,139
- Get him on oxygen.
- Look at Mama.

148
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,842
- He's going to be all right, isn't he?
- Wake up.

149
00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:56,815
- Anything like this ever happen before?
- No, ma'am.

150
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,185
- Any allergies?
- Nothing.

151
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,356
- No medication within the past year?
- Nothing!

152
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:03,606
- Allergies to medication?
- He's fine. He just fell down.

153
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:05,363
His liver's enlarged. Flip him.

154
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:09,073
- He's going to be all right, isn't he?
- Pulse is 150, pulse ox 78%.

155
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:11,659
- B.P. 68 over 34.
- What is the matter with him?

156
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:15,205
Would you come with me?
There are procedures we need to go over.

157
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:17,706
- What kind of procedures?
- We're admitting your son.

158
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:20,125
- You need to fill out the proper forms.
- What kind of forms?

159
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:24,040
Your son may need a transfusion.
We'll need to test you both for blood type.

160
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:27,509
- We're coming right back, baby.
- Wait a minute!

161
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:31,765
- First name, Mr Archibald.
- John.

162
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:35,095
- Middle initial?
- Q. Quincy.

163
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:37,138
Name of your insurance company?

164
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:41,066
- Where is he? Is he okay?
- We don't know. They're running tests.

165
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:44,694
- We're waiting to find the results.
- Is there anything we can do?

166
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:47,777
- Your card, Mr Archibald.
- I'm sorry.

167
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:51,859
Your insurance card.
I'll need to make a copy for our files.

168
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:59,160
It's okay. You can go in now.

169
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,697
Sweetheart.

170
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:36,535
How you doing, slugger?

171
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:42,083
I can't talk.

172
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:46,674
Don't worry about it. Get your rest.
We're going to be out of here in a while.

173
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,887
- We love you, son.
- I love you, too.

174
00:16:56,853 --> 00:16:59,142
What is all this?

175
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:02,190
This? This is so we can
monitor Mike's vitals.

176
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:06,065
Respiratory rate,
pulse oximetry, heart rate.

177
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:10,444
And this one is blood pressure...
diastolic and systolic.

178
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:13,494
We'd like this top number
to stay above 90.

179
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,111
If his blood pressure drops,
we're going to have to do something.

180
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:18,240
We can't have him going
below 70 again.

181
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:22,668
Why? What would that mean,
if he went below 70 again?

182
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:26,129
70 and below, he's in heart failure.

183
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,586
- If you need anything.
- Thank you.

184
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:42,522
- How's the company insurance?
- He works part time.

185
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:46,441
- She works as a grocery store clerk.
- Can we do anything?

186
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:47,981
I got to go.

187
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:52,898
Mr and Mrs Archibald.
I'm Rebecca Payne, Hospital Director.

188
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:54,694
Hi there.
It's nice to meet you.

189
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:58,078
This is Dr Turner, head of Cardiology
and Michael's doctor.

190
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:00,949
- How do you do?
- Good. My wife.

191
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:03,164
How's our boy doing?

192
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:06,125
Please sit down.

193
00:18:28,196 --> 00:18:31,195
This x-ray shows
a normal nine-year-old's heart.

194
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:34,490
This x-ray is that of your son Michael.

195
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:41,497
There are septal defects
here, here, and here

196
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:44,413
which have induced myopathy,
resulting pulmonary edema,

197
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:46,419
and malignant ventricular ectopy.

198
00:18:46,548 --> 00:18:50,924
Michael's heart is approximately
three times larger than normal size.

199
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:52,249
I'm sorry.

200
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:57,386
I didn't understand what you said.
Could you put that in layman terms?

201
00:18:57,516 --> 00:19:02,059
Basically, there's not enough blood
being pumped by Michael's heart,

202
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:06,233
so it backs up in the lungs
like a sponge getting wet.

203
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:10,645
His heart is trying,
but it's working too hard.

204
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,448
What, does he need
an operation, or...

205
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:19,866
We're considerably beyond
corrective surgery, Mr and Mrs Archibald.

206
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:21,872
Mike's heart is useless.

207
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:24,622
He's going to need a transplant
or he's going to die.

208
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:29,959
Wait a second.
There are other options.

209
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:33,257
- What options?
- To do nothing.

210
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:36,801
Medicate him. Make him feel
as comfortable as possible.

211
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,386
You're going to have to start thinking
about quality of life now.

212
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:41,142
I don't understand.

213
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,018
We were just with him
and he seemed fine.

214
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:48,853
He's going to seem fine,
but as his heart gets worse,

215
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:53,895
he will become increasingly fatigued,
and he will sleep more and more,

216
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:58,659
until one day he will fall asleep,
and he won't wake up.

217
00:20:00,622 --> 00:20:03,456
I know this is difficult,
but you have to face the fact

218
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:06,667
that your son
may not live much longer.

219
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:10,162
You might want to make it
a happy time, say good-bye.

220
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:13,087
God.

221
00:20:13,216 --> 00:20:16,966
Transplantation is a high-risk operation.
You could lose your son on that table.

222
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:19,256
You might not want
to take that chance.

223
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:25,269
If he doesn't have the surgery...

224
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:33,737
If he doesn't have the surgery,
how long would he live?

225
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:36,401
Not long. Months, weeks.

226
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:38,993
Days.

227
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:43,702
Come on. All right.

228
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:45,325
Come on, now.

229
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:54,462
I'm sorry.

230
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:58,214
This is a lot.

231
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:15,644
All right.

232
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:21,575
If he was your son,
what would you do?

233
00:21:24,204 --> 00:21:29,495
- I'd do the transplant, absolutely.
- Okay. Okay?

234
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:34,331
Let's do that. Let's do it.

235
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,254
First we've got to get Mike's name
on the organ recipient list.

236
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,425
He's B-positive, so his name
should go right to the top.

237
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:45,590
It's not so simple.

238
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:50,056
There are other considerations before
a recipient can be placed on a donor list.

239
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:55,066
Transplant surgery is very expensive.
In most cases, prohibitively so.

240
00:21:55,195 --> 00:21:58,362
We got insurance, major medical.
He's covered.

241
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,065
We've already checked
with your carrier, Mr Archibald.

242
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:04,155
There are no provisions in your policy
for a procedure of this magnitude.

243
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:08,708
That's a mistake.
Not that you're making a mistake.

244
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:13,544
I'm just saying that I'm insured.
My son's covered.

245
00:22:13,672 --> 00:22:15,713
Mrs Archibald,
do you have coverage?

246
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:18,593
No. I've only been working
at the supermarket a couple months.

247
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,253
- You don't get benefits until...
- Doesn't matter. We got insurance.

248
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:28,060
I can see here
that you don't own your home.

249
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:30,808
You have no stocks,
no bonds, no investments.

250
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,440
- You have a little over $1,000 in savings.
- But we got insurance.

251
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:37,569
That may very well be. You're going to
have to check with your carrier.

252
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:40,733
In the meantime, we're going to
have to treat this as a cash account.

253
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:43,357
- What?
- How much does a transplant cost?

254
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:46,863
Wait a minute.
How much does it cost?

255
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,706
Transplant surgery,
doctors' fees, postoperative care,

256
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:54,418
immunosuppressant drugs...
you're looking at a minimum of $250,000.

257
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:59,256
If you opt for transplant surgery,
that is your choice,

258
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:04,047
but the hospital maintains a very
strict policy with regard to cash patients.

259
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,511
We require down payment before we put
a patient's name on a receivers' list.

260
00:23:08,645 --> 00:23:11,016
- How much?
- What kind of down payment?

261
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:14,517
30%... $75,000.

262
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:16,691
$75,000...

263
00:23:19,071 --> 00:23:21,609
- To put my son's name on a list.
- Our son is upstairs dying.

264
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,285
- All you can do is talk about money?
- It costs money to provide health care.

265
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,910
It's expensive for you,
it's expensive for us.

266
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,164
You're going to
have to guarantee payment

267
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:34,536
before I can put
your son's name on the list.

268
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:39,751
Mr and Mrs Archibald,
please wait!

269
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:45,589
If you people don't want to treat our son,
we'll take him over to County Memorial.

270
00:23:45,723 --> 00:23:48,214
- You don't want to do that.
- They have to treat him.

271
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:52,479
Heart transplantation is
always considered an elective procedure.

272
00:23:52,606 --> 00:23:56,021
- You're in the right place.
- What are we supposed to do?

273
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:58,060
Talk to your insurance company again.

274
00:23:58,194 --> 00:24:00,566
Check with our human resources
department for medical assistance.

275
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:04,232
There's money. There's Children's
State Services and Medicaid.

276
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:09,160
You find a way to keep him here.
You just don't take no for an answer.

277
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:13,997
Your policy has changed,
Mr Archibald.

278
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,749
Changed to what?

279
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,080
We've recently switched carriers
from a PPO to an HMO.

280
00:24:21,217 --> 00:24:25,713
It's a less expensive policy.
Unfortunately, there are some restrictions.

281
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:29,595
- What kind of restrictions?
- Here's how it works.

282
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:32,217
Non-management
part-time employees such as yourself

283
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:36,185
only qualify for second-tier
catastrophic coverage.

284
00:24:36,316 --> 00:24:39,400
I'm not part time, I'm full time.
It's just slow right now.

285
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:43,063
Sure, but your coverage
is based on hours worked.

286
00:24:43,197 --> 00:24:45,903
Like I said,
you only qualify for second tier.

287
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:49,569
That has a maximum
payout limit of $20,000.

288
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:50,985
What?

289
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,907
You have been taking money
out of my cheque every week.

290
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:58,749
I've been paying into
this policy for years.

291
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,502
That's why we're going to cover you
for the full $20,000.

292
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:05,886
You're kidding me, right?
Come on.

293
00:25:07,346 --> 00:25:12,342
You have dropped me from full time
to part time. You switched carriers.

294
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:17,851
Now you're telling me I'm not fully covered
even though I got a policy that says I am?

295
00:25:19,192 --> 00:25:23,059
- It doesn't seem right, does it?
- No, it doesn't. My son is very sick.

296
00:25:23,197 --> 00:25:25,521
If I'm not covered,
I got a serious problem.

297
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,991
I understand that,
but there's nothing I can do.

298
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,953
- You can file an appeal.
- Yeah?

299
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:36,077
Here you go. That takes
about seven working days.

300
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,721
Says here you already have
medical insurance.

301
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,806
- Not enough.
- What little we have is already used up.

302
00:25:57,354 --> 00:25:58,470
You on welfare?

303
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:03,560
- You should be on welfare.
- We both have jobs.

304
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,154
That's too bad.

305
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,521
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

306
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:09,236
Try County Medical.

307
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,941
Yes, ma'am, I need to speak
to somebody in Financial Aid.

308
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,166
No, I don't want to hold.
I've been holding for 15 minutes.

309
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,422
We don't have enough money!
Should I get another job?

310
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,300
- I'm not yelling.
- You're yelling in here!

311
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:34,927
Next, please.

312
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:44,064
- Wrong line. Window 15.
- What?

313
00:26:44,194 --> 00:26:45,392
Window 15.

314
00:27:03,464 --> 00:27:05,622
- No.
- No, what?

315
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,501
No, you don't qualify.

316
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:11,051
My son is dying, I'm broke.
If I don't qualify, who the hell does?

317
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:12,509
I'm sorry.

318
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:15,130
I don't need you to be sorry!
I need you to help me!

319
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:42,251
No, this is an appeal.

320
00:27:43,044 --> 00:27:47,957
An appeal is for an already existing claim.
You needed to file a grievance.

321
00:27:48,092 --> 00:27:50,631
- You filed the wrong paperwork.
- Wait a minute.

322
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:53,298
You're going to have to resubmit.
It could take 30 days.

323
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:55,173
- I don't have 30 days.
- I know.

324
00:27:55,307 --> 00:28:00,052
I'm getting sick of the run-around.
I need my son's name on that list.

325
00:28:00,188 --> 00:28:02,974
Your account is in excess of $30,000.

326
00:28:03,107 --> 00:28:05,859
The hospital has bent over backwards
to help you out.

327
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:08,655
- Is that right?
- Yes, it is right.

328
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:11,022
But there is a limit to our generosity.

329
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:14,442
Once and for all,
your insurance does not cover this.

330
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,421
Take it.

331
00:28:35,557 --> 00:28:38,642
- Watch your step.
- This thing is frigging heavy.

332
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,601
Get out of the way.

333
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:48,735
Friends, one among us
is suffering in great pain today.

334
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:52,657
This is a good man.

335
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,068
"'You can't say
that you're not going to pitch. '

336
00:29:38,203 --> 00:29:41,409
Bernie frowned,
puzzled by Babe's answer. 'Okay, Babe."'

337
00:29:45,212 --> 00:29:46,326
Let us pray.

338
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:50,582
God of mercy, into his hands
Your son Jesus Christ

339
00:29:50,717 --> 00:29:53,337
commended his spirit
at his last hour.

340
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:57,218
Into those same hands,
we commend Your servant...

341
00:30:01,187 --> 00:30:05,481
You should try that news guy
does all them special investigative reports.

342
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:08,144
You know the one,
the guy with the frigging hair?

343
00:30:08,276 --> 00:30:11,063
- Pretty boy. What's his frigging name?
- Lampley.

344
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:15,063
- Tuck Lampley.
- I'll give you $20 for the TV.

345
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:17,870
- It's a colour TV.
- $20.

346
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:23,374
Call him up, Jimmy.

347
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,501
You don't mind if we walk and talk.
I'm up to here today.

348
00:30:26,628 --> 00:30:29,083
- Not at all.
- What can I do you for?

349
00:30:29,214 --> 00:30:34,552
My son Mike, he fell into heart failure
at this Little League game.

350
00:30:34,677 --> 00:30:38,842
I got full insurance from the job.
Now they're telling me they won't pay.

351
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:41,050
What about the hospital?
Don't they have to cover it?

352
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:44,470
- That's what I was saying.
- They're telling me I got to pay cash.

353
00:30:44,604 --> 00:30:47,355
Otherwise I got to take my son home
and watch him die.

354
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,271
We was thinking you can do
one of them special interest pieces.

355
00:30:51,402 --> 00:30:53,360
Send donations,
write your congressman.

356
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:56,323
Anything you can do,
Mr Lampley, would help.

357
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,072
I think what's happening to your son
is outrageous. I want to help.

358
00:31:00,204 --> 00:31:03,158
I got to run this by my producers.
I got bosses like everybody else.

359
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:06,492
- Right.
- Leave your number with Karen up front.

360
00:31:08,378 --> 00:31:10,869
Thank you very much.

361
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,430
Give me $100.

362
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:29,600
Come on, it's a diamond ring.

363
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:32,397
All right, $90.
Give me $90, then.

364
00:32:13,694 --> 00:32:15,734
He's going to die.

365
00:32:15,863 --> 00:32:18,781
- What?
- They're releasing him.

366
00:32:18,907 --> 00:32:23,485
- Who?
- Dr Turner just left here.

367
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:27,369
They are releasing Mike this morning.

368
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:30,703
They're not going to send him home.
I gave them money yesterday.

369
00:32:30,836 --> 00:32:35,047
It doesn't matter. Listen to me.
They are releasing him.

370
00:32:35,174 --> 00:32:38,091
I talked to the hospital.
They said... I'll take care of it.

371
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:42,963
You always take care of everything,
but it's never enough, is it?

372
00:32:43,098 --> 00:32:46,015
You need to do something,
do you hear me?

373
00:32:46,141 --> 00:32:47,767
Do something!

374
00:33:32,731 --> 00:33:36,681
You're doing great. You really are.
You've gained what, five pounds?

375
00:33:37,778 --> 00:33:41,146
You're the only patient I have
who eats the food in this place.

376
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:45,066
Doc, let me ask you something.
How long before I'm able to play tennis?

377
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:49,615
You couldn't play before you had
a new heart. Take up knitting.

378
00:33:49,749 --> 00:33:52,074
- I play tennis.
- We don't care.

379
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:54,535
Would you please
get back to work? Thank you.

380
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,078
Heidi, make an appointment
for us to have dinner next week.

381
00:33:57,214 --> 00:33:58,413
I'm going to cook.

382
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:01,917
No, and you're not wearing lingerie
around him the next month.

383
00:34:02,052 --> 00:34:05,920
You're not in his will. He told me.
Don't push your luck.

384
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:09,140
I gave the hospital $6,000 yesterday.

385
00:34:11,437 --> 00:34:14,058
- Can I talk to you?
- Yes, sure.

386
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,062
- Take care of him.
- Take care. Thank you.

387
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:30,868
My wife Denise says you're going to
send Michael home. Is that true?

388
00:34:30,998 --> 00:34:34,118
I'm a physician.
I don't make policy decisions.

389
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:37,918
- That's handled by the board of trustees.
- You're the head of cardiac surgery.

390
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:40,717
You make a recommendation,
they're going to listen, aren't they?

391
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:44,922
I make recommendations all the time.
The final decision rests with the board.

392
00:34:45,055 --> 00:34:48,590
- That's it? Send him home.
- I'm afraid so.

393
00:34:49,852 --> 00:34:54,181
Can we take a little walk?
It won't take long, I promise you.

394
00:34:54,314 --> 00:34:55,559
Fine.

395
00:34:57,192 --> 00:35:00,311
I'm looking at the brochure last night.

396
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:05,073
It says this hospital
does over 300 heart surgeries a year.

397
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,071
300 surgeries, $250,000 a pop.

398
00:35:08,203 --> 00:35:10,529
You know how much that is?
I did the math.

399
00:35:10,664 --> 00:35:13,333
That's $75 million worth
of heart surgeries.

400
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:16,792
You're telling me
you can't do one for me in good faith?

401
00:35:16,921 --> 00:35:19,707
I waived my fee in your son's case.
I know you're not asking...

402
00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:23,173
Nobody asked you to waive the fee.
I can raise the money.

403
00:35:23,302 --> 00:35:28,047
I already came up with $22,000,
and I swear to God on my life

404
00:35:28,182 --> 00:35:30,969
I will pay for this
if you give me the opportunity.

405
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:35,051
I'm only getting 20 hours on the job.
I can do this. I can pay.

406
00:35:35,189 --> 00:35:37,810
I swear to God,
I'll pay you the money back.

407
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:41,192
I don't know how,
but I promise you I will. Trust me.

408
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:45,152
I give you my word
as a man. Please.

409
00:35:47,242 --> 00:35:49,781
Could you take your hands
off me, please?

410
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:55,077
- I've done everything I can. I'm sorry.
- No, you haven't.

411
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:58,792
- Yes.
- Let's go inside and talk about it.

412
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:06,131
I'm not asking anymore, Doctor.
I'm telling you.

413
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:09,630
You are going to give my son
a new heart, you understand me?

414
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:20,066
Don't move.

415
00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:33,904
Don't even think about it.

416
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:36,248
Put your hands down.

417
00:36:37,294 --> 00:36:39,084
- Mr Archibald, I...
- Shut up.

418
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:42,248
I know how upset you are,
but this is not the way to handle it.

419
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:45,003
You can't go through this way.

420
00:36:45,134 --> 00:36:46,592
Put your hands up.

421
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,091
- Put them up.
- Oh, God.

422
00:36:50,223 --> 00:36:52,345
- Give me your gun.
- I don't have a gun.

423
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:54,514
They don't have guns.
They're not armed.

424
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:58,344
All right. Put your hands down.
Sit down. No, get up.

425
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:01,232
- You fail to realise the jeopardy...
- Get over here. Shut up!

426
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,359
- We have got to talk about this.
- Shut up. Don't move.

427
00:37:04,487 --> 00:37:07,571
John, wait.
Just stop. Stop!

428
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,570
If you do this, you're on
an irreversible course of action.

429
00:37:12,704 --> 00:37:15,075
Put on the brakes
and think about this.

430
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:17,827
- We really need to talk.
- Mr Archibald, I hope...

431
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:19,536
- Back up, please.
- What?

432
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:21,625
- Do as he says.
- Would you please back up?

433
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:24,671
- What are you doing?
- I'm not taking no for an answer.

434
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:27,586
- Back up.
- That guy's got a gun!

435
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,501
Stay right there.

436
00:37:36,894 --> 00:37:39,052
What are you doing?
Get back over there.

437
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:43,317
Sit on your hands over there!
Get over there!

438
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:47,654
Turner, everybody, get down!
Sit on your hands!

439
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,150
Put your hands under your butt!
Don't anybody move.

440
00:37:57,456 --> 00:37:58,867
What are you doing?

441
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,750
I'm bleeding. Trying to get
my goddamned finger sewn back on.

442
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:07,925
Mr Archibald, these people
have nothing to do with this.

443
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,091
Let them go.
They need treatment.

444
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,885
This is a hospital. You're a doctor.
Why don't you treat them? Start with him.

445
00:38:15,307 --> 00:38:19,056
What's the matter, Doctor?
You want to see his insurance card first?

446
00:38:20,188 --> 00:38:22,725
- I'll do it.
- Okay, you do it.

447
00:38:22,857 --> 00:38:25,348
Wait a minute.
I got a pregnant wife here.

448
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:31,155
Listen, all right, wait.
Listen, everybody.

449
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,863
The hospital's
under new management now.

450
00:38:39,165 --> 00:38:42,368
From now on, free health care
for everybody. How's that?

451
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:44,079
Righteous, man.

452
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:47,086
Don't have to squeeze it like...
You crazy?

453
00:38:47,216 --> 00:38:49,173
- What's your name?
- Max.

454
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,458
You and Dr Turner come with me.

455
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:55,048
- You got keys for that elevator?
- Yeah.

456
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:57,256
I want you to kill the power.
Turn it off.

457
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:20,035
- Keep an eye on him, Max.
- You got to sit still.

458
00:39:20,164 --> 00:39:24,163
- I can't do this with you moving around.
- You remind me of Doogie Howser.

459
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:29,089
- We were here before the black guy.
- Everybody's going to get their turn.

460
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:31,753
We're not going anywhere
for a while, so just sit tight.

461
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:34,759
Just relax, okay?

462
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:51,695
- Is this Hope Memorial Hospital?
- Yeah, emergency room.

463
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:54,691
Could you give me directions?
I need to get over there.

464
00:39:54,824 --> 00:39:56,235
No, ma'am.

465
00:39:56,367 --> 00:40:00,531
We're closed for repairs right now.
You're going to have to call...

466
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:06,085
- This is an emergency!
- Have you tried Mount Angel?

467
00:40:06,212 --> 00:40:09,911
No. That's too far.
My husband usually drives.

468
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:14,509
- I'm going to need directions.
- Which way are you coming from?

469
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:18,719
Go down Flower, make a right turn,
go all the way to the end, make a left.

470
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:21,470
- You understand?
- I'm asking you to do something.

471
00:40:21,603 --> 00:40:23,891
You're welcome.
Miss, come from under there.

472
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,515
Come from out of there.
Come on out.

473
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:31,560
What? No, what?

474
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,024
Go sit over there.

475
00:40:35,364 --> 00:40:38,152
Unbelievable.
This place is a joke.

476
00:40:38,286 --> 00:40:42,069
Good thing I'm not cut.
I'd bleed to death in this joint, am I right?

477
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:44,993
Excuse me, brother man!

478
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:48,412
No. You need to do something,
Steve, all right?

479
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:50,253
You need to get your butt up!

480
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,168
- I want you to do something.
- Would you please sit down?

481
00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:56,052
- I don't want to sit down!
- What is wrong with you?

482
00:40:56,178 --> 00:40:57,175
Wait a minute.

483
00:40:59,098 --> 00:41:01,590
Relax. Don't have the baby yet.
When is it due?

484
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:04,562
- Any minute.
- Don't have it.

485
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:06,810
- I'm having it.
- Not yet. Hang on.

486
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,857
- Brother.
- She's having a baby. Hang on a second.

487
00:41:09,983 --> 00:41:13,933
- Excuse me, brother man.
- The woman's having a baby!

488
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,741
- When is she going to see a doctor?
- Sit down!

489
00:41:18,369 --> 00:41:20,076
- That's cool.
- Dr Klein!

490
00:41:20,204 --> 00:41:23,987
- I'll be there in a minute.
- You and me, we got no problems.

491
00:41:24,123 --> 00:41:26,200
That's right.
Just stay in your seat.

492
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:34,003
I don't understand
what you're saying, ma'am.

493
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:41,136
The ear? Ear infection?
Can you help her with the ear infection?

494
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:44,931
- Me? I can't.
- Why not?

495
00:41:45,062 --> 00:41:47,812
I don't know anything.
It's my first day.

496
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:01,657
Everybody, in the other room.
Everybody, in the other room right now.

497
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:06,121
They're going to take
great care of you, I promise.

498
00:42:08,084 --> 00:42:11,037
- What? Open up!
- It's dropping.

499
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:14,256
We've got a gunshot victim out here.
He's lost a lot of blood.

500
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:18,460
- Go to another hospital.
- Let's go. Open the door.

501
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,596
You know these guys?
You sure?

502
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:25,130
- They're here all the time.
- Open the door.

503
00:42:28,437 --> 00:42:30,395
- Take your jacket off.
- What?

504
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:33,941
Open it up. Take it off.

505
00:42:35,195 --> 00:42:40,237
Put it on the ground. Walk away.
Just leave him right there. Go!

506
00:42:41,952 --> 00:42:43,150
Just go.

507
00:42:45,746 --> 00:42:49,162
- What's wrong with him?
- He got shot.

508
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,132
All right, come on.

509
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:11,061
Wait a minute.
I want to see what's in that bag.

510
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:13,147
What happened to you, buddy?

511
00:43:13,275 --> 00:43:19,895
I gave them all the money in the register.
They shot me anyway.

512
00:43:20,032 --> 00:43:22,985
Jesus Christ.
He needs to go into surgery right now.

513
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:25,074
Can I take him to Trauma One?

514
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:27,112
- Thanks.
- What do we got?

515
00:43:27,246 --> 00:43:30,083
- Gunshot wound to the belly.
- Anything from the EMTs?

516
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:32,700
No. Dr Turner,
we're going to need your hand.

517
00:43:32,835 --> 00:43:36,668
- I just bought this suit.
- Can you give me a hand?

518
00:43:36,798 --> 00:43:40,463
On three, two, one, lift.
Thank you.

519
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,296
I can't handle a gut shot.

520
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:47,101
I'm a cardiac surgeon,
not an emergency room physician.

521
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:50,677
It's like riding a bike, Doctor.
Just pretend you're getting paid.

522
00:43:50,813 --> 00:43:54,430
- This is apples and oranges. I can't.
- The man is dying. Help him.

523
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:56,773
- I'd like to. I haven't done this...
- Do it!

524
00:43:59,196 --> 00:44:01,816
75 milligrams Demerol I.V.,
lidocaine 2% local.

525
00:44:01,948 --> 00:44:03,905
I'll scrub now.

526
00:44:05,034 --> 00:44:08,072
When I get out of here, I'm suing
this hospital and your security company.

527
00:44:08,205 --> 00:44:10,281
What makes you so sure
you're getting out at all?

528
00:44:21,718 --> 00:44:22,713
Right behind you!

529
00:44:22,845 --> 00:44:24,422
Here we go.

530
00:44:37,694 --> 00:44:41,062
You've got to stand
behind the line, sir.

531
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:44,730
Move this out of here for me, please?
Thank you very much.

532
00:44:44,867 --> 00:44:47,904
- Lieutenant, we got a real problem here.
- What's that?

533
00:44:48,036 --> 00:44:51,203
This guy's in for the long haul...
locked down the E.R.,

534
00:44:51,332 --> 00:44:54,083
barricaded himself in,
killed power in the elevators.

535
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,413
We can bust down the door, but this
son of a bitch might start killing people.

536
00:44:57,547 --> 00:45:00,119
There's two pinpoint cameras
hidden in the E.R.

537
00:45:00,256 --> 00:45:03,211
- The hospital's own surveillance.
- We got a video tap being set up.

538
00:45:03,344 --> 00:45:06,594
- Are you in charge of security?
- No, that would be Wally Pitoniak.

539
00:45:06,722 --> 00:45:10,802
- He's at home. It's his day off.
- Not anymore, it ain't. Get him here.

540
00:45:12,727 --> 00:45:15,398
All right,
can you get me a secure line?

541
00:45:15,522 --> 00:45:18,689
We've got one of our guys inside.
He's got a walkie-talkie.

542
00:45:18,818 --> 00:45:20,442
You might want to try this.

543
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:23,061
Put a clamp on all phone lines
to the emergency room.

544
00:45:23,197 --> 00:45:25,984
If this guy picks up the phone,
I want him talking to me.

545
00:45:26,117 --> 00:45:29,034
- Done.
- Who's in charge here?

546
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,079
Rebecca Payne, sir.
It's her day off, too.

547
00:45:32,205 --> 00:45:35,077
Jesus Christ, does anybody
work at this hospital?

548
00:45:35,209 --> 00:45:37,664
- It's Saturday, sir.
- So what?

549
00:45:37,795 --> 00:45:40,250
People get sick
on Saturday, don't they?

550
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:47,797
Seыor, no cry.

551
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:55,476
Mr Archibald, I need to do
an internal examination on her.

552
00:45:55,604 --> 00:45:58,059
- Where you going to take her?
- Examination room there.

553
00:45:58,191 --> 00:45:59,221
Good. Go.

554
00:46:07,324 --> 00:46:11,453
- Just remember, it ain't your fault.
- Excuse me.

555
00:46:11,578 --> 00:46:14,069
I think my fiancжe
might have broken her arm.

556
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:16,877
I was wondering if we could
get somebody to look at her.

557
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:19,954
- Sure. What happened?
- A drunk ran a red light...

558
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:23,290
Ran a red light.
He slammed into us. Right?

559
00:46:23,423 --> 00:46:26,959
- It was an accident.
- Yes, it was.

560
00:46:27,094 --> 00:46:31,508
This is the police depantment.
I'm speaking to the man in charge.

561
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:34,595
Please pick up the walkie-talkie.

562
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:37,728
The building is surrounded.
There's no way in or out.

563
00:46:37,855 --> 00:46:40,345
If you hear me.
I advise you to respond.

564
00:46:43,694 --> 00:46:45,651
Hello. Is anyone there?

565
00:46:48,282 --> 00:46:51,733
This is Lieutenant Frank Grimes
of the Chicago Police Department.

566
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,992
Are you the man in charge?

567
00:46:56,207 --> 00:46:59,373
- That's right.
- Who am I speaking to?

568
00:47:01,212 --> 00:47:02,374
John...

569
00:47:04,217 --> 00:47:05,296
Q.

570
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,213
All right, John Q.

571
00:47:09,347 --> 00:47:13,180
Again, I'm Lieutenant Grimes,
but I want you to call me Frank.

572
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,349
- Can you do that?
- Sure, Frank.

573
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:18,977
I'll be the hostage negotiator.
I've been a cop for 35 years.

574
00:47:19,107 --> 00:47:22,273
This is all I do.
I don't play games. I don't fool around.

575
00:47:22,402 --> 00:47:25,486
If I say something,
you can take it to the bank.

576
00:47:25,613 --> 00:47:29,825
Let's get down to it.
Is anybody hurt?

577
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:32,075
It's an emergency room.
Everybody's hurt.

578
00:47:32,204 --> 00:47:33,283
Right.

579
00:47:33,414 --> 00:47:35,037
- They're fine.
- Good.

580
00:47:35,165 --> 00:47:38,451
As long as it stays that way,
we can keep talking.

581
00:47:38,585 --> 00:47:40,079
What is it you want?

582
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:44,957
Find Rebecca Payne, Hope Memorial's
Administrative Supervisor.

583
00:47:45,091 --> 00:47:50,299
You find her. Tell her I want
my kid's name on the donors' list.

584
00:47:52,558 --> 00:47:55,261
- Kid boy or girl?
- A boy.

585
00:47:55,393 --> 00:47:59,854
I got two boys myself.
Two girls and two boys.

586
00:48:01,941 --> 00:48:04,065
Don't handle me.
I don't want to be handled.

587
00:48:04,194 --> 00:48:06,482
It insults my intelligence
as a human being!

588
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:09,899
Take it easy. The idea is
not to get too excited, all right?

589
00:48:10,034 --> 00:48:12,704
I'm going to take it
any way I can get it, understand?

590
00:48:12,828 --> 00:48:18,497
If I don't get it, there's going to be
some dead bodies on your hands in here.

591
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:22,539
I hear you loud and clear. I'm going to
jot that down. Rebecca Payne, right?

592
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,295
All right.

593
00:48:24,965 --> 00:48:27,586
There's a lot of cops
out here, John.

594
00:48:28,803 --> 00:48:30,879
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

595
00:48:31,013 --> 00:48:32,472
I'm sure.

596
00:48:33,723 --> 00:48:37,258
All right, sit tight.
You're in a tough spot, a lot of trouble.

597
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:39,635
If you work with me,
if you're reasonable,

598
00:48:39,771 --> 00:48:41,894
we'll figure a way
out of this, okay?

599
00:48:42,024 --> 00:48:44,146
We have to have a little faith
in one another.

600
00:48:44,734 --> 00:48:46,692
- Why is that, Frank?
- Why?

601
00:48:47,655 --> 00:48:53,028
Because that's what faith's all about...
believing when you don't want to believe.

602
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:55,531
Besides, what else
are you going to do?

603
00:48:58,081 --> 00:49:00,038
- I want my epidural.
- Too late for that.

604
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:04,295
- Something for the pain.
- Out! She'll be fine.

605
00:49:14,347 --> 00:49:16,838
- First child?
- Yeah.

606
00:49:18,893 --> 00:49:21,052
Just kind of nervous.
You know how it is.

607
00:49:21,187 --> 00:49:24,520
I was, too. What do you want,
a boy or a girl?

608
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:28,564
Doesn't matter to me, man,
as long as my kid's healthy.

609
00:49:28,696 --> 00:49:30,155
That's all I want.

610
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:36,656
Listen, I didn't mean
anything by that.

611
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:48,211
Who was driving?
The car... who was driving?

612
00:49:48,342 --> 00:49:52,337
I was. What's that
got to do with anything?

613
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:54,378
Why is your girl
all banged up and you're not?

614
00:49:58,141 --> 00:49:59,802
What do you call this?

615
00:50:01,227 --> 00:50:04,063
- What are you laughing at?
- Somebody get this fool a Band-Aid.

616
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:08,898
- I don't want you to bleed to death.
- Screw you. That shit hurts.

617
00:50:09,861 --> 00:50:14,108
- His air bag went off and mine didn't.
- What kind of car you drive?

618
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,158
- Mercedes 500.
- You drive a Mercedes 500?

619
00:50:18,078 --> 00:50:22,491
- What year?
- 1986. It's a classic.

620
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:27,587
Mercedes didn't make
passenger-side air bags till 1988.

621
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,247
- Busted.
- What's your point, John?

622
00:50:32,384 --> 00:50:35,967
- What's yours, Mitch?
- You from the Slap-a-Ho tribe.

623
00:50:36,095 --> 00:50:39,761
You like to beat on that young lady,
and everybody here knows it.

624
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,355
I was drunk, all right?

625
00:50:58,076 --> 00:51:02,455
- Don't smoke in here, Mitch.
- Give me a break. Work with me here.

626
00:51:02,582 --> 00:51:07,327
- I'm trying my best.
- Mr Q, could I get some water?

627
00:51:07,462 --> 00:51:11,293
- I need to tinkle.
- I got missed-meal cramps.

628
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:14,210
I'm hungry. Let's get a bucket
of chicken or something.

629
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:15,587
In a minute.

630
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:19,303
- How's it going in there?
- He's going to make it.

631
00:51:19,432 --> 00:51:22,883
You have any idea how much blood
this guy lost? It's incredible.

632
00:51:23,018 --> 00:51:25,012
He saved this man's life.

633
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:40,736
- What's that?
- Lasix.

634
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:44,037
It's a diuretic to help get rid
of some of the fluid build-up.

635
00:51:44,165 --> 00:51:47,284
It's potassium-depleting,
so he needs this one to supplement.

636
00:51:48,377 --> 00:51:49,408
And those?

637
00:51:49,544 --> 00:51:53,459
Dopamine for his blood pressure,
Dig for his heart, Primacor.

638
00:51:55,091 --> 00:51:58,212
- It seems like so much.
- Yeah, it's a lot.

639
00:51:58,346 --> 00:52:00,919
- This is antibiotic.
- What for?

640
00:52:01,057 --> 00:52:03,630
It's prophylactic, just in case.

641
00:52:06,812 --> 00:52:09,054
- And those?
- These two?

642
00:52:09,189 --> 00:52:14,231
- They're for pain.
- I don't feel so good.

643
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:17,696
This is going to make you feel yucky
for a few minutes, buddy.

644
00:52:17,824 --> 00:52:20,990
I'm going to get you some of those
crunchy ice chips you want.

645
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,494
How does that sound?

646
00:52:23,872 --> 00:52:28,082
Mike, by the way, there was this guy,
he stopped by to see you.

647
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:32,669
He said he was a friend of yours.
I got him right here.

648
00:52:32,796 --> 00:52:36,213
I didn't know if I should let him in.
What do you think?

649
00:52:36,343 --> 00:52:37,966
- He's okay.
- He's okay?

650
00:52:38,095 --> 00:52:40,051
Said he wanted
to hang out with you.

651
00:52:40,179 --> 00:52:41,508
He's okay.

652
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:42,754
That's great.

653
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:46,476
Thank you.

654
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:05,068
Oh, my baby!

655
00:53:05,204 --> 00:53:07,777
Let me hold my baby!

656
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:17,331
- Mom? Is Dad coming?
- Yeah, he's coming.

657
00:53:17,467 --> 00:53:21,300
When? Where is he?

658
00:53:22,515 --> 00:53:26,179
I don't know, but he's coming.

659
00:53:36,278 --> 00:53:37,939
What are you up to?

660
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:41,074
Never mind me. You're worthless.
Some security guard.

661
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,071
You should have zapped the bastard
when you had the chance.

662
00:53:44,202 --> 00:53:49,446
With what? Besides, I'm not sticking
my neck on the line for $8.50 an hour.

663
00:53:59,218 --> 00:54:00,926
- Pay dirt.
- Are you nuts?

664
00:54:01,054 --> 00:54:04,337
- What the hell are you doing?
- Looking out for number one.

665
00:54:04,473 --> 00:54:08,139
You want to stay alive, sit tight
and wait for the cavalry to get here.

666
00:54:08,269 --> 00:54:12,053
The cops are coming in shooting.
They don't care about his kid.

667
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:16,732
Once he realises that,
we're all history.

668
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:21,238
If he catches you with that scalpel,
you're the one that's history, asshole.

669
00:54:21,365 --> 00:54:25,279
He don't look so bad to me.
"Ethyl chloride." Just like mace.

670
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,744
Put that stuff back
before you get us in trouble.

671
00:54:28,873 --> 00:54:31,958
You listen, you stupid rent-a-cop.
I am not a slob.

672
00:54:32,084 --> 00:54:35,288
I have a life.
It means something to me.

673
00:54:35,421 --> 00:54:38,540
I'm not going down
in this shit-hole. No, sir.

674
00:54:40,175 --> 00:54:42,049
Back it up.

675
00:54:47,142 --> 00:54:49,430
How are you?
How you all doing?

676
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,392
Good. How are you?
How are you, fellows?

677
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:56,144
Is it true the man inside
wants an operation for his son?

678
00:54:56,276 --> 00:54:59,063
Everything good?
Good to see you.

679
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,898
- Do you know what weapon he has?
- You'll talk to me, right?

680
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,865
I'll let you know when I know, okay?
You'll be the first.

681
00:55:06,578 --> 00:55:08,950
- I'll let you know later.
- Gus, how are you?

682
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:12,034
- How you doing, Frank? It's hot.
- Yeah, it is.

683
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:16,164
- A little early for heavy artillery, isn't it?
- Maybe. Maybe not.

684
00:55:16,294 --> 00:55:19,047
- You should tell me. What's going on?
- You're looking at it.

685
00:55:19,173 --> 00:55:23,634
A very upset father inside. We'll give him
a couple of minutes to cool off.

686
00:55:27,766 --> 00:55:32,060
Let's not give him too much time.
Let's end this quick and quiet.

687
00:55:32,186 --> 00:55:34,474
- That's the plan.
- All right. Good.

688
00:55:34,606 --> 00:55:38,057
In that case, I'm just here
to lend my support in any way that I can.

689
00:55:38,192 --> 00:55:41,063
I don't need a babysitter on this.
It's under control.

690
00:55:41,195 --> 00:55:42,358
- Is it?
- Yes.

691
00:55:42,488 --> 00:55:46,356
All right. Can't have people
running around the street using guns.

692
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,235
Makes it look like the city's unsafe.

693
00:55:50,204 --> 00:55:51,948
Besides, I got to be here.

694
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:54,620
Chief doesn't show up,
looks like he's asleep at the wheel.

695
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,585
Just stay out of my way.
The TV cameras are over there.

696
00:55:57,712 --> 00:56:00,464
They should make you feel
right at home.

697
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,163
Right. Why don't you just relax?

698
00:56:06,012 --> 00:56:07,590
- Why can't you relax?
- I'm fine.

699
00:56:07,722 --> 00:56:10,296
- Why don't you just do your job?
- I'm doing my job.

700
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:13,185
We're both cops, right?
We're on the same side, remember?

701
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:15,102
- Right.
- Right?

702
00:56:16,523 --> 00:56:18,681
It's good to see you. Thanks.

703
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:23,275
Yes, Mr Mayor.
I'll see you in a little bit.

704
00:56:23,404 --> 00:56:25,777
No, we got it. I got it.

705
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:27,897
How are you?

706
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:30,822
The old man, looking for his Depends.
He leave them over here?

707
00:56:42,367 --> 00:56:45,289
What I don't understand is why
they never found it, the doctors.

708
00:56:45,497 --> 00:56:49,253
My son has had clean checkups
every year since the day he was born.

709
00:56:49,461 --> 00:56:53,422
- How could the doctors not pick it up?
- He might not have been tested enough.

710
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:54,675
Why not?

711
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,575
You got an HMO, right?

712
00:57:00,724 --> 00:57:02,288
There's your answer.

713
00:57:02,393 --> 00:57:07,713
HMOs pay their doctors not to test.
It's their way of keeping costs down.

714
00:57:07,816 --> 00:57:11,466
Say Mike did need additional testing
and insurance says they won't cover them.

715
00:57:11,675 --> 00:57:13,969
The doctor keeps his mouth shut,
and come Christmas,

716
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:17,930
the HMO sends the doctor
a fat-ass bonus cheque.

717
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:22,626
- Is that true?
- Possible. Not likely, but possible.

718
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:25,440
These doctors may have known
what was wrong with my son,

719
00:57:25,648 --> 00:57:27,839
and they could have
treated him all along?

720
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:32,532
- Who knows? I don't know.
- Don't take this personal, Doc.

721
00:57:32,637 --> 00:57:35,454
- You're a bunch of crooks.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

722
00:57:35,558 --> 00:57:38,789
- What about that thing you take?
- The thing?

723
00:57:38,893 --> 00:57:40,249
That promise.

724
00:57:40,353 --> 00:57:44,004
- It's called the Hippocratic Oath.
- More like the hypocritical oath.

725
00:57:44,108 --> 00:57:46,091
How's it go, Doc?

726
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:49,427
"I solemnly swear to take care
of the sick and damn-near-dying,

727
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:51,305
unless they ain't got major medical."

728
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:53,599
- Something like that?
- You've got it perfectly.

729
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:58,293
It's funny, but it's not far from the truth.
This shit happens all the time.

730
00:57:58,397 --> 00:58:00,273
Paramedics bring in
some accident victim.

731
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:04,029
When the boys in Accounting find out
they can't pay, they send them packing.

732
00:58:04,237 --> 00:58:06,948
- Hospitals can't turn people away.
- Isn't there laws against that?

733
00:58:07,157 --> 00:58:10,702
There's also ways around those laws.
We have to stabilise them.

734
00:58:10,806 --> 00:58:12,998
After that, we're off the hook.

735
00:58:13,103 --> 00:58:15,815
- That's not how it works.
- That's exactly how it works.

736
00:58:15,919 --> 00:58:19,256
Maybe not on the fifth floor,
but in here if you don't have money,

737
00:58:19,465 --> 00:58:22,385
you get a Band-Aid, a foot in the ass,
and you're out the door.

738
00:58:22,487 --> 00:58:26,764
Enough already. I've heard all the bitching
and moaning I can stand for one day.

739
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:30,937
If you all want to regard me as some kind
of blood-sucking vampire, great.

740
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,316
I'll be the bad guy.
But who's holding the fucking gun?

741
00:58:43,452 --> 00:58:46,266
Sir? Lieutenant!

742
00:58:51,064 --> 00:58:57,217
This is Frank Grimes.
You pick up the phone, you get me.

743
00:58:57,322 --> 00:59:01,286
- What can I do for you?
- What's going on with the list?

744
00:59:01,495 --> 00:59:05,249
- I'm working on it, but I need time.
- Time I don't have.

745
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:09,001
- Let's talk about the hostages.
- What do you want to know?

746
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:13,069
- What's going on? How are they?
- They're fine. They're full.

747
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:17,242
We're eating candy bars
and discussing HMOs, waiting for you.

748
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:20,265
- I want you to let some of them go.
- For what?

749
00:59:20,475 --> 00:59:22,979
I do for you, you do for me.
Show some good faith.

750
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:25,064
A lot of nervous people out here.

751
00:59:25,273 --> 00:59:28,711
Make everybody breathe a lot easier
if we saw some happy faces.

752
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:33,198
I'll do for you when you start doing for me.
I want my kid's name on that list.

753
00:59:33,302 --> 00:59:36,222
- I'm not kidding around here.
- Good faith.

754
00:59:36,327 --> 00:59:39,145
- Good faith only takes you so far...
- What's that?

755
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:42,479
...merit system. So far,
you haven't earned any points.

756
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,669
Excuse me.
I need to talk to you.

757
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,486
This woman is six centimetres dilated.
The baby is breeched.

758
00:59:47,695 --> 00:59:51,344
I've medicated her, but we have to
move her up to Maternity immediately.

759
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:54,369
- Hang on, Frank.
- Right down here.

760
00:59:56,037 --> 00:59:58,541
- What the hell is going on?
- Do you know this man?

761
01:00:01,982 --> 01:00:04,278
His name is John Archibald.
He has a son here in ICU.

762
01:00:04,485 --> 01:00:07,512
Put people on the door.
Find the mother. I need to talk to her.

763
01:00:07,615 --> 01:00:09,804
- Are you there, Frank?
- I'm here, John.

764
01:00:10,014 --> 01:00:14,392
I changed my mind, all right?
I'm going to let some of the hostages go.

765
01:00:14,498 --> 01:00:16,166
That's the right thing.

766
01:00:16,373 --> 01:00:19,608
But when I do,
the clock starts, you understand?

767
01:00:20,338 --> 01:00:25,760
It's 4:15. You got one hour.
You got till 5:15, you understand?

768
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:29,515
If my boy's not on that list by 5:15,
somebody in here is going to die.

769
01:00:29,619 --> 01:00:31,916
- Don't be stupid.
- 5:15, Frank!

770
01:00:32,124 --> 01:00:36,502
- 5-1-5, something happens for me!
- Got it.

771
01:00:36,607 --> 01:00:38,797
You're a cop. Call the coroner.

772
01:00:40,153 --> 01:00:43,805
This is bad, Frank.
This has just got to go away.

773
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:48,913
All right, Miriam...

774
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,276
And Rosa. Vamos.  Let's go.

775
01:00:55,379 --> 01:00:59,342
Mr Archibald,
please let my husband come with me.

776
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:02,157
I need you to get out of here.
I will be okay. Just go.

777
01:01:02,262 --> 01:01:05,706
- Shit, I'll go. I'm free.
- Steve, baby, no, please.

778
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:08,729
- What kind of man are you?
- Screw you, Tyrone.

779
01:01:08,938 --> 01:01:10,920
What? Screw me, Tyrone?

780
01:01:11,128 --> 01:01:14,467
Wait a second.
Wait a minute. Just relax.

781
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:20,410
That's right, tough guy.

782
01:01:26,564 --> 01:01:29,587
Julie, baby.
Get the gun! Come on!

783
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:31,674
Go over there
and pick up that gun.

784
01:01:31,884 --> 01:01:35,948
Shoot him! Shoot him
right in the face, Julie!

785
01:01:36,156 --> 01:01:39,602
Get up! Get the gun!
There you go, baby.

786
01:01:39,705 --> 01:01:43,666
What are you... are you crazy?
What are you doing?

787
01:01:43,771 --> 01:01:44,815
Come on now!

788
01:01:47,735 --> 01:01:49,610
Max, you got cuffs?

789
01:01:49,717 --> 01:01:51,593
Oh, God!

790
01:01:54,722 --> 01:01:57,433
You stupid bitch!

791
01:01:57,537 --> 01:02:00,251
That's for beating the shit out of me!

792
01:02:02,439 --> 01:02:05,777
And that's for being an asshole!

793
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:14,121
And this,
this is for calling me a bitch!

794
01:02:15,997 --> 01:02:17,457
I felt that one.

795
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,315
And I'm not going to be
your Barbie anymore!

796
01:02:22,359 --> 01:02:27,052
Goddamn! All that ass
and muscles to go with it.

797
01:02:27,157 --> 01:02:30,389
- I knew damn well you wasn't no blonde.
- Give them to me.

798
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:33,935
Mitch! Look at me!

799
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:40,716
Come here.

800
01:02:52,604 --> 01:02:54,585
Let's go, both of you.

801
01:02:56,149 --> 01:03:00,113
Whatever happens, I want you to know
everything's going to be okay.

802
01:03:00,218 --> 01:03:02,199
- You understand me?
- Yes.

803
01:03:02,303 --> 01:03:06,475
Don't worry.
Don't worry about anything.

804
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:09,081
I'll always be there for you, baby.

805
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,464
Don't shoot!

806
01:03:17,633 --> 01:03:21,077
I'm letting some hostages go!
Don't shoot!

807
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,186
All right, Steve. You, too.
Let's go, both of you.

808
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:31,296
- Thank you.
- Muchas gracias. Seыor.

809
01:03:31,504 --> 01:03:33,696
- Thank you, Mr Archibald.
- You, too.

810
01:03:35,467 --> 01:03:36,927
Take care of his ear.

811
01:03:37,032 --> 01:03:39,744
The gunman has just freed
several hostages.

812
01:03:39,952 --> 01:03:43,393
who will immediately be debriefed
by members of the crisis team.

813
01:03:43,498 --> 01:03:46,941
Will the man known as John Q
get a heant for his little boy?

814
01:03:47,046 --> 01:03:48,400
Only time will tell.

815
01:03:48,504 --> 01:03:51,110
From Hope Memorial Hospital.
I'm Tuck Lampley.

816
01:03:51,215 --> 01:03:55,387
Is it true an ambulance dropped off
a victim after the gunman took over?

817
01:03:55,596 --> 01:03:57,891
He unlocked the door
and he let him inside!

818
01:03:57,995 --> 01:04:00,706
- Can you comment?
- The man was critically injured.

819
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:03,000
If he hadn't let him in,
he would have died.

820
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:08,111
- Ma'am, are you all right?
- I feel good. We're having a baby!

821
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:10,510
Ma'am, any comments
about the gunman?

822
01:04:10,615 --> 01:04:13,846
- John Q very good man.
- The gunman?

823
01:04:14,055 --> 01:04:15,306
Very good man!

824
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,448
They got a camera.
They're watching a video feed.

825
01:04:28,553 --> 01:04:30,743
- How do you know?
- They're looking at something.

826
01:04:30,847 --> 01:04:35,540
- I want to know what. Can you get it?
- Boss, if they got it, I can get it.

827
01:04:35,644 --> 01:04:38,669
You give in, there's going to be guns
in every hospital in the country.

828
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:41,692
You think Mr Archibald's
the only one who has a sick child?

829
01:04:41,901 --> 01:04:44,926
Have you checked the HIV ward?
There's a whole floor full.

830
01:04:45,031 --> 01:04:48,055
People get sick. They die.
That's the way it goes.

831
01:04:48,158 --> 01:04:50,350
I'm faced with
decisions like this every day.

832
01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:54,834
There's a man threatening innocent people
because you refused to help his son.

833
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:59,318
There are 50 million people in this country
without medical insurance.

834
01:04:59,525 --> 01:05:02,342
If you'd like to change it,
call your congressman.

835
01:05:02,552 --> 01:05:06,930
Excuse me. Why don't we just tell him
his son's name's on the list?

836
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:11,520
Doesn't that make sense?
How's he going to know, anyway?

837
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,424
Sir? Pardon me.
Can you come take a look at this?

838
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:23,931
Sarge, Chief Moroe,
this is Wally Pitoniak, head of security.

839
01:05:24,036 --> 01:05:26,225
Nice to meet you.
I got your spot.

840
01:05:26,955 --> 01:05:31,129
Here's your sight.
That's going to be your perch.

841
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:33,419
The X there, that's your phone.

842
01:05:34,988 --> 01:05:37,177
- Which phone?
- Bring it up, Jeff.

843
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,662
The phone right there.

844
01:05:45,415 --> 01:05:48,857
It is. Tom. But Chief Moroe maintains
the police will do whatever is necessary

845
01:05:48,962 --> 01:05:51,673
to preserve the lives
and safety of these hostages.

846
01:05:51,777 --> 01:05:53,655
- Thanks. Tuck.
- This country, man.

847
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:58,766
Can't go anywhere anymore without
getting mugged or murdered or stabbed.

848
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:01,581
Kids killing their classmates.
Drive-bys.

849
01:06:01,788 --> 01:06:05,440
- I won't even go into a post office.
- Shut up, Mitch.

850
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:08,984
You shut up.
I hate the little bastard, but he's right.

851
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:12,322
You know how easy it is to get a gun?
Five minutes. Gun show.

852
01:06:12,531 --> 01:06:16,285
I understand your kid is sick, John,
but what makes him better than me?

853
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:18,893
- I got a life, too.
- But you got insurance.

854
01:06:19,102 --> 01:06:22,335
So what, are you going to shoot me?
That's what you're telling the cops.

855
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:26,716
If your son doesn't get
the very first heart available, we all die.

856
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:31,827
How's it going to end, John?
What's your move?

857
01:06:32,661 --> 01:06:36,100
I got no moves, okay?
I don't know what I'm going to do.

858
01:06:39,334 --> 01:06:41,524
I'm waiting on a miracle, okay?

859
01:06:42,674 --> 01:06:44,757
I'm waiting on an act of God.

860
01:07:13,332 --> 01:07:14,792
Could we have a word
with you, please?

861
01:07:17,506 --> 01:07:19,276
This is all my fault.

862
01:07:19,381 --> 01:07:22,199
When the hospital told me
they were releasing Mikey,

863
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:26,369
I called John and yelled at him,
told him to do something, anything.

864
01:07:26,472 --> 01:07:29,290
But I never thought...

865
01:07:29,394 --> 01:07:32,627
I understand.
Is he a violent man, Mrs Archibald?

866
01:07:32,838 --> 01:07:39,407
No! He's sweet and gentle.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

867
01:07:39,511 --> 01:07:43,370
That's not what he's saying.
He's talking about killing people.

868
01:07:43,579 --> 01:07:49,314
I may be fishing, but has he spent time
in the military or anything like that?

869
01:07:51,298 --> 01:07:53,694
- What is this?
- What?

870
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,241
I see what's going on here.

871
01:07:58,596 --> 01:08:02,455
You're trying to get me to say something
you can use against my husband.

872
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,104
He's in a lot of trouble.
We're going to need you to talk to him.

873
01:08:06,313 --> 01:08:08,816
Let's get something straight, mister.

874
01:08:09,025 --> 01:08:12,257
You cannot use me
to build a case against my husband.

875
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:17,472
I support him in everything he does.
I'm on his side, not yours.

876
01:08:17,577 --> 01:08:19,558
And you don't talk to me!

877
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:24,983
I would tell you
what I think of you...

878
01:08:26,546 --> 01:08:28,423
...but I'm a Christian woman.

879
01:08:30,718 --> 01:08:34,158
Now you two leave me alone.
I have a sick child to look after.

880
01:08:38,644 --> 01:08:42,085
I've decided to put Michael's name
on the recipient list.

881
01:08:43,545 --> 01:08:45,630
The hospital will pay for everything.

882
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:49,803
Really?

883
01:08:49,908 --> 01:08:51,474
Really.

884
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:54,183
Thank you.

885
01:08:54,914 --> 01:08:57,521
Oh, God, thank you.

886
01:09:05,237 --> 01:09:06,488
You're good.

887
01:09:08,053 --> 01:09:10,036
- Excuse me?
- Quite the performance.

888
01:09:10,244 --> 01:09:12,955
- What are you talking about?
- Comforting embrace, sincere look.

889
01:09:13,164 --> 01:09:15,667
For a minute,
I actually believed you cared.

890
01:09:28,912 --> 01:09:32,772
We go now to Hope Memorial Hospital.
live... Tuck Lampley.

891
01:09:32,981 --> 01:09:36,421
As you can see. The crowd
in front of Hope Memorial is growing.

892
01:09:36,526 --> 01:09:39,968
The S.W.A.T. Team has arrived.
The situation is becoming tense.

893
01:09:40,071 --> 01:09:43,827
Standing next to me is James Palumbo.
friend of John Archibald.

894
01:09:43,932 --> 01:09:47,371
Mr Palumbo. What can you tell us
about John Archibald?

895
01:09:47,476 --> 01:09:53,108
You know. I got to be honest. Tuck.

896
01:09:53,213 --> 01:09:57,280
This whole thing sucks.

897
01:09:57,489 --> 01:10:01,555
It all could have been avoided
so incredibly easy.

898
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:04,892
None of this had to happen
if John had been a frigging millionaire

899
01:10:04,997 --> 01:10:08,335
or if his last name was Rockefeller.
but sometimes John don't get it.

900
01:10:08,439 --> 01:10:12,923
He don't understand that what
we hold sacred in this country isn't values.

901
01:10:13,028 --> 01:10:16,993
It's value that's important.
We got haves. We got have-nots.

902
01:10:17,097 --> 01:10:20,120
We've got white collar.
blue collar. And no collar.

903
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:26,169
Inside there we got surgery.
outpatient surgery. Out-of-luck surgery.

904
01:10:27,316 --> 01:10:32,007
There's a lot of people out there
who don't got 250 grand in their billfold.

905
01:10:32,531 --> 01:10:36,181
To shame a man like that
and back him into a corner.

906
01:10:36,285 --> 01:10:40,353
seems to me that something
is out of whack. Not someone.

907
01:10:40,561 --> 01:10:43,898
But what do I know?
I'm a factory worker.

908
01:10:44,003 --> 01:10:47,131
I see this is making you upset.
but if you could look into the camera

909
01:10:47,235 --> 01:10:50,157
and speak to John Q right now.
what would you say to him?

910
01:10:51,722 --> 01:10:53,910
I'm there with you.
and you take care.

911
01:10:55,161 --> 01:10:56,414
That's one man's opinion.

912
01:10:56,517 --> 01:11:00,168
Live at the crisis at Hope Memorial.
this is Tuck Lampley.

913
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:34,480
What's going on?
Where's everybody?

914
01:11:34,688 --> 01:11:37,713
We're sending one of our guys
in through the air duct.

915
01:11:37,816 --> 01:11:41,780
If we can get the target
to this phone, we got a clear shot.

916
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:44,908
- Is that right?
- Yes, Lieutenant, that is right.

917
01:11:45,012 --> 01:11:46,473
When you're ready, Chief.

918
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:05,350
- My wife's calling.
- Worse than that. It's Father Time.

919
01:12:05,559 --> 01:12:07,332
Come over here!

920
01:12:08,061 --> 01:12:10,669
Not one word.
I don't want to hear it.

921
01:12:10,773 --> 01:12:12,963
You're going behind my back!

922
01:12:13,067 --> 01:12:16,406
What do you want from me?
Look at the clock! Look at your watch!

923
01:12:16,616 --> 01:12:20,262
The guy said at a quarter after,
he's going to start killing people.

924
01:12:20,472 --> 01:12:23,393
- This is so goddamned stupid!
- What's your great idea?

925
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,938
There are no great ideas,
especially this!

926
01:12:27,043 --> 01:12:29,650
I got a shot at this guy,
I'm going to take it.

927
01:12:29,755 --> 01:12:33,092
You know the drill.
Always take the open shot.

928
01:12:33,302 --> 01:12:35,595
The wife has agreed to speak to him.
Let her talk him down.

929
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:39,767
- That's exactly what I'm going to do.
- You used the wife to set him up?

930
01:12:39,975 --> 01:12:43,521
I'm going to use whatever works.
Let me paint a picture for you.

931
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:47,797
What we have is a lose/lose. This guy
starts whacking hostages, that's bad.

932
01:12:47,902 --> 01:12:50,509
If we give into this asshole,
it's also bad.

933
01:12:50,613 --> 01:12:54,157
- Bad for who?
- Everybody. Me, you, everybody.

934
01:12:54,262 --> 01:12:55,933
It's an election year.

935
01:12:56,142 --> 01:12:58,852
However it goes down,
this guy's not going to make it.

936
01:12:58,956 --> 01:13:02,816
- You kill him, that's a P.R. bonanza?
- I can live with one dead bad guy.

937
01:13:02,921 --> 01:13:08,345
What I can't live with is one innocent
person being hurt, not on my watch.

938
01:13:09,596 --> 01:13:12,202
You know what, Frank?
You're out!

939
01:13:12,307 --> 01:13:16,061
- I'm out?
- You're officially relieved of duty.

940
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:18,251
- I'm going to handle this now.
- You?

941
01:13:18,355 --> 01:13:21,484
Me. You think it's my first time
around the dance floor?

942
01:13:21,589 --> 01:13:24,507
How do you think I got these?
And watch it.

943
01:13:24,611 --> 01:13:27,843
I got a lot of pressure on me.
There's a lot of eyes watching.

944
01:13:27,948 --> 01:13:31,496
Someone's got to make the call.
You're not going to do it, are you?

945
01:13:31,599 --> 01:13:32,851
I'll do it.

946
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:36,292
What about the hostages,
the human beings?

947
01:13:36,502 --> 01:13:37,856
Better keep their heads down.

948
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:52,144
- Great.
- What is it?

949
01:13:52,248 --> 01:13:54,230
The air conditioning just turned off.

950
01:14:00,488 --> 01:14:03,827
I'm counting on you.
Don't let me down, okay? I'll call you!

951
01:14:04,034 --> 01:14:06,329
Right on. Excuse me. Sorry.

952
01:14:06,433 --> 01:14:08,832
Don't touch me!
Excuse me. Thank you.

953
01:14:09,042 --> 01:14:11,230
Tuck Lampley, Channel 8?
Right. You got it.

954
01:14:11,437 --> 01:14:13,108
Thanks, Officer! Excuse me.

955
01:14:16,028 --> 01:14:17,278
Where's my picture?

956
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:19,990
I got to unscramble the police encryption.
We're almost there.

957
01:14:20,094 --> 01:14:22,494
Hurry up.
I got a contact in Cardiology.

958
01:14:22,597 --> 01:14:26,041
The cops are going to set up a call
between this guy and his wife.

959
01:14:30,212 --> 01:14:33,548
Are you with the wife?
All right, let's patch it through.

960
01:15:05,254 --> 01:15:07,026
This better be good, Frank.

961
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:14,223
God, baby.

962
01:15:16,204 --> 01:15:18,706
- We're on the list.
- What?

963
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:22,462
Payne just left here.
Mikey's name is on the list.

964
01:15:22,566 --> 01:15:26,008
- Baby, you did it.
- What? We're on the list?

965
01:15:32,476 --> 01:15:34,457
This is great, baby.

966
01:15:42,068 --> 01:15:46,136
- We got sound.
- Where's the video? I need picture.

967
01:15:46,345 --> 01:15:49,159
Boss, hang on.
I'm going to make you really famous.

968
01:15:50,098 --> 01:15:52,602
I'm just...

969
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:57,713
That's great, baby.
How's Mikey doing?

970
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:08,246
Not too good.
I think he's going away.

971
01:16:08,352 --> 01:16:10,540
What?

972
01:16:10,643 --> 01:16:17,004
They've done everything they can for him,
but he keeps getting worse and worse.

973
01:16:18,573 --> 01:16:21,596
Oh, God.

974
01:16:21,805 --> 01:16:23,889
Our poor baby.

975
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:37,342
Are you praying for him, John?
Are you praying for our baby?

976
01:16:37,447 --> 01:16:40,160
Yes, sweetheart.
You know I am.

977
01:16:40,995 --> 01:16:43,184
Checkmate.
This is the White Rook. Copy.

978
01:16:43,287 --> 01:16:44,538
I copy, White Rook.

979
01:16:44,643 --> 01:16:46,626
It's going to be all right, sweetheart.
Listen to me.

980
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:49,752
He's going to make it.

981
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:54,135
I swear on my life, he's going to make it.
You understand me?

982
01:16:56,846 --> 01:17:00,287
You just got to believe me,
you understand?

983
01:17:00,496 --> 01:17:01,643
I believe.

984
01:17:02,791 --> 01:17:06,234
Is he awake? Is Mikey awake?
Can I talk to him?

985
01:17:07,171 --> 01:17:08,526
Hold on.

986
01:17:18,851 --> 01:17:20,000
Oh, my God.

987
01:17:20,104 --> 01:17:23,543
We got it! Boss!
The video's online.

988
01:17:23,648 --> 01:17:25,527
- You are a genius.
- I got to get the monitor.

989
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:29,280
What are you doing standing around?
Move your ass! This is it!

990
01:17:29,384 --> 01:17:32,096
Thank you.
Freddy, I swear to God...

991
01:17:32,201 --> 01:17:34,494
Nigel, you're moving
like lava. Hustle.

992
01:17:34,705 --> 01:17:36,894
How's my hair?
Never mind. Let's get this.

993
01:17:36,998 --> 01:17:38,981
And three, two, one.

994
01:17:39,084 --> 01:17:41,586
This is Tuck Lampley,
live at Hope Memorial Hospital,

995
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:44,612
bringing you exclusive coverage
between a father and his son

996
01:17:44,714 --> 01:17:46,696
he's fighting
most desperately to save.

997
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,348
Honey?

998
01:17:50,452 --> 01:17:52,539
It's your dad.
He's on the phone.

999
01:18:01,091 --> 01:18:02,236
Champ.

1000
01:18:04,634 --> 01:18:06,306
How's my boy?

1001
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:07,765
You hanging in there?

1002
01:18:10,685 --> 01:18:14,960
- How are you?
- How am I? I'm good.

1003
01:18:16,002 --> 01:18:17,777
Don't worry about me.
I'm good.

1004
01:18:25,703 --> 01:18:27,685
How come you're not here, Dad?

1005
01:18:37,591 --> 01:18:44,266
I'm tied up. I can't get away now.
But I'm close. real close to you.

1006
01:18:44,476 --> 01:18:47,292
Mom says I need a new heart.

1007
01:18:47,396 --> 01:18:49,689
That's right, champ. You do.

1008
01:18:51,046 --> 01:18:54,278
But what's wrong with my heart?

1009
01:18:54,383 --> 01:18:57,617
There's nothing wrong.
It's just that you...

1010
01:19:01,057 --> 01:19:05,123
You just need a...
They're going to...

1011
01:19:05,228 --> 01:19:09,505
You got to get a better heart
to be stronger, that's all.

1012
01:19:09,713 --> 01:19:12,633
They're giving you a new one
that's going to make you real strong.

1013
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:29,216
Am I going to die?

1014
01:19:30,678 --> 01:19:33,284
No, you're not going to die.
Of course not.

1015
01:19:35,266 --> 01:19:37,664
How do you know?

1016
01:19:37,768 --> 01:19:41,001
What good would
the world be without you?

1017
01:19:41,107 --> 01:19:43,817
Oh, my God. This is
the greatest thing I've ever seen.

1018
01:19:44,026 --> 01:19:46,006
Without you there is no world.

1019
01:19:46,737 --> 01:19:48,406
This is my white Bronco.

1020
01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:52,265
Listen to me.

1021
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:54,352
On your command.

1022
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,835
You know I love you, don't you?
You know how proud I am of you?

1023
01:20:00,711 --> 01:20:02,901
I just wanted to make sure
you know that.

1024
01:20:03,843 --> 01:20:06,656
I just wanted to tell you that
in case I forgot.

1025
01:20:09,473 --> 01:20:10,516
Take the shot.

1026
01:20:12,184 --> 01:20:13,644
It's not clear.

1027
01:20:14,687 --> 01:20:16,461
Holding.

1028
01:20:18,859 --> 01:20:21,676
Why don't you give me
one of those Chris Cormeirs?

1029
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:30,435
Chris Cormeir. He's great.

1030
01:20:30,643 --> 01:20:32,835
He's great and so are you, baby.

1031
01:20:37,319 --> 01:20:39,510
I love you, Dad.

1032
01:20:41,907 --> 01:20:43,369
Okay, son.

1033
01:20:45,559 --> 01:20:47,642
I'll talk to you later, okay?

1034
01:20:48,372 --> 01:20:50,564
With all my heant. Son.
I love you.

1035
01:20:50,668 --> 01:20:53,380
- I love you. Too. Dad.
- Oh, shit!

1036
01:20:56,092 --> 01:20:59,636
You're on TV, man.
Channel 8.

1037
01:21:31,655 --> 01:21:33,636
He's down. We got him.

1038
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,671
He's not down.

1039
01:21:57,206 --> 01:21:59,292
Goddamn it!

1040
01:21:59,396 --> 01:22:01,482
Command. Yes, sir.

1041
01:22:01,587 --> 01:22:04,506
- This is very bad, Gus.
- Not now.

1042
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:07,322
It's the mayor, sir.
We better kill this video feed.

1043
01:22:07,532 --> 01:22:11,599
The press hacked into our signal.
This went out live over national television.

1044
01:22:34,438 --> 01:22:36,631
- Mikey's not going to make it.
- What about the list?

1045
01:22:36,734 --> 01:22:39,547
What list? They're shooting
at me, shooting at us.

1046
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:41,634
They're not going to help my son.

1047
01:22:41,739 --> 01:22:44,139
The sniper gained access
to the hospital through the venti...

1048
01:22:44,867 --> 01:22:46,952
- Are you going to bust me?
- Out of here.

1049
01:22:47,161 --> 01:22:49,560
You just shot an innocent man
on prime-time TV.

1050
01:23:14,903 --> 01:23:16,676
Where's Grimes?

1051
01:23:18,032 --> 01:23:19,910
Hang in there, man!

1052
01:23:20,118 --> 01:23:22,206
Where's Lieutenant Grimes?

1053
01:23:22,829 --> 01:23:25,853
- All right.
- All right what?

1054
01:23:26,061 --> 01:23:29,295
- Let's go see what he wants.
- You've got to be kidding.

1055
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,215
Don't start breaking my balls.
I screwed up, all right?

1056
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:35,553
I need you to save my ass.
I really stepped in shit. Please.

1057
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:38,684
Come on, I'll buy you a steak.

1058
01:23:40,559 --> 01:23:44,210
Peking duck. Let's go.

1059
01:23:44,315 --> 01:23:47,650
A-R-C-H-l-B-A-L-D.

1060
01:23:47,755 --> 01:23:50,780
I'm faxing you
all the stuff right now.

1061
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:02,357
Come over here.

1062
01:24:04,026 --> 01:24:07,570
- Hold your fire!
- Don't fire. Turn them down.

1063
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:10,699
There's a lot of cameras.
I don't want anybody doing anything.

1064
01:24:12,266 --> 01:24:13,620
Who's that with you?

1065
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:17,060
- Sergeant...
- Moody!

1066
01:24:17,165 --> 01:24:20,190
Police Chief Moroe.

1067
01:24:20,293 --> 01:24:22,275
What's going on here, John?

1068
01:24:25,718 --> 01:24:27,699
He's got no pants on.

1069
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:36,981
You lied to me, Lieutenant.

1070
01:24:37,086 --> 01:24:39,901
You said you were going to
call me back, but you didn't.

1071
01:24:40,005 --> 01:24:43,655
I gave you your hostages,
but you didn't call me back. Why?

1072
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,620
- Because you want me dead.
- Nobody wants to kill you.

1073
01:24:47,724 --> 01:24:50,019
Nobody wants to kill me?

1074
01:24:50,226 --> 01:24:53,250
None of these guys? Not him?

1075
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:55,024
What is this?

1076
01:25:01,489 --> 01:25:05,557
What did you think would happen?
You want truth? Here's some truth.

1077
01:25:05,766 --> 01:25:10,564
This is going to end up bad for you.
There's only two ways out of here.

1078
01:25:10,771 --> 01:25:14,317
Jail or dead.

1079
01:25:14,422 --> 01:25:18,905
My son is very sick
and he needs some help.

1080
01:25:19,009 --> 01:25:23,599
It's hard to be a man these days,
hard to know what the right thing is.

1081
01:25:23,807 --> 01:25:27,562
- But put the gun down, John.
- You're not hearing me, Frank!

1082
01:25:27,771 --> 01:25:32,883
My son is sick! That's it!
There's nothing else. End of story.

1083
01:25:34,656 --> 01:25:37,678
When people are sick,
they deserve a little help.

1084
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:41,223
Sick, help.

1085
01:25:45,605 --> 01:25:49,150
I am not going to bury my son!

1086
01:25:50,401 --> 01:25:53,636
My son is going to bury me.

1087
01:25:53,741 --> 01:25:56,868
You think these people
give a shit about you? They don't.

1088
01:25:56,974 --> 01:26:02,083
You're just the cause of the moment.
Nobody cares. That's the real truth.

1089
01:26:02,187 --> 01:26:04,691
Nobody cares. Only you.

1090
01:26:05,942 --> 01:26:11,991
And it's only you and me out here
and all these guns pointed at you.

1091
01:26:13,033 --> 01:26:15,015
What do you want to do?
It's your call.

1092
01:26:15,224 --> 01:26:16,685
I want my son.

1093
01:26:17,937 --> 01:26:22,002
- I want my son inside with me.
- Can't do it, John!

1094
01:26:22,107 --> 01:26:25,131
You give me my boy,
I give you your sniper.

1095
01:26:25,234 --> 01:26:26,801
It's all over.

1096
01:26:28,573 --> 01:26:30,868
You bring my son,

1097
01:26:30,972 --> 01:26:32,848
I give up...

1098
01:26:33,789 --> 01:26:35,665
...everybody goes home.

1099
01:26:38,272 --> 01:26:40,047
Everybody's safe.

1100
01:26:43,799 --> 01:26:45,676
You bring me my son.

1101
01:26:46,824 --> 01:26:48,180
Come on.

1102
01:26:48,284 --> 01:26:49,640
All right.

1103
01:26:51,205 --> 01:26:53,081
What do you think, Frank?

1104
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:57,046
Give it to him. He's not going to
hurt anybody with his boy in there.

1105
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:59,860
The object is to get hostages out,
not bring them in.

1106
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:02,782
It's not a hostage.
It's his son.

1107
01:27:02,886 --> 01:27:06,638
Have all these people
been on the news?

1108
01:27:06,743 --> 01:27:08,726
It's your call, Frank.

1109
01:27:13,836 --> 01:27:15,297
All right, give it to him.

1110
01:27:17,798 --> 01:27:20,615
- Hold it!
- No, listen to me.

1111
01:27:20,823 --> 01:27:23,013
I'm his mother.
I need to be in there!

1112
01:27:24,996 --> 01:27:28,228
Stop! Stop right there!

1113
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:31,252
Go! Beat it! Now!

1114
01:27:47,419 --> 01:27:51,380
We're in trouble. Mike's blood pressure
has dropped into the mid-40s.

1115
01:27:51,485 --> 01:27:55,032
His atrial blood pressure
should be in the low teens. It's 35.

1116
01:27:55,135 --> 01:27:56,595
I'm sorry, John.

1117
01:27:56,804 --> 01:28:00,558
Without a new heart,
he's not going to make it.

1118
01:28:07,753 --> 01:28:08,799
Then take mine.

1119
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:11,926
- What?
- You heard me.

1120
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:14,637
Take my heart,
and you put it in Mike.

1121
01:28:14,741 --> 01:28:18,286
- You done lost your damn mind.
- You can't be serious.

1122
01:28:18,391 --> 01:28:20,584
You bet I'm serious.
I'm dead serious.

1123
01:28:20,689 --> 01:28:21,730
Oh, my God.

1124
01:28:23,401 --> 01:28:25,797
- You'll be dead.
- And my son will live.

1125
01:28:25,902 --> 01:28:28,509
- You can't do this.
- It's the only way.

1126
01:28:28,615 --> 01:28:32,368
- Physically, you can't do this.
- I kill myself.

1127
01:28:32,472 --> 01:28:34,453
You open me up, take my heart.

1128
01:28:34,558 --> 01:28:36,226
- It's perfect.
- That's just crazy.

1129
01:28:36,435 --> 01:28:38,937
We can't just remove your heart
and put it into Michael's body.

1130
01:28:39,042 --> 01:28:40,397
There are too many unknowns.

1131
01:28:40,502 --> 01:28:43,111
Matching donor and recipient
is extremely complicated.

1132
01:28:43,217 --> 01:28:45,613
- Critical tests have to be taken.
- Like what?

1133
01:28:45,823 --> 01:28:48,114
Cross matches for blood type,
chest cavity measurements.

1134
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:50,723
If blood tissues
are not completely compatible...

1135
01:28:50,932 --> 01:28:54,163
I know about compatibility.
We've been tested up the wazoo.

1136
01:28:54,268 --> 01:28:56,772
We're both B-positive.
Our tissues match.

1137
01:28:56,981 --> 01:28:59,692
His heart's three times the size
of normal, so mine will fit.

1138
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:03,341
- You know we're compatible.
- Out of the question. Too risky.

1139
01:29:03,447 --> 01:29:06,680
- I'm telling you he will make it!
- Can't do it.

1140
01:29:06,784 --> 01:29:11,164
If I'm laying dead, you're not going to
take my heart and save his life?

1141
01:29:11,267 --> 01:29:14,084
You'll let two die instead of one
because of a technicality?

1142
01:29:14,189 --> 01:29:18,360
- I think what John is trying to do is right.
- Me, too. I think it's so brave.

1143
01:29:18,569 --> 01:29:20,966
What do you think Mike would want?
What about your wife?

1144
01:29:21,176 --> 01:29:23,054
Mike's too young to know
what's good for him.

1145
01:29:23,158 --> 01:29:26,911
It's my job to protect him.
Denise would do the same thing.

1146
01:29:28,998 --> 01:29:33,065
I know what's happening to Mike is bad.
Matter of fact, it's the worst.

1147
01:29:33,274 --> 01:29:36,613
But killing yourself
ain't going to solve a damn thing.

1148
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:40,470
Sometimes you just
got to let go and let God...

1149
01:29:41,305 --> 01:29:43,182
Just accept it, brother.

1150
01:29:43,807 --> 01:29:45,373
Accept it?

1151
01:29:46,728 --> 01:29:47,771
Accept what?

1152
01:29:51,213 --> 01:29:53,403
That Mike is going to die.

1153
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:58,095
No, I don't accept that. Ever.

1154
01:29:59,347 --> 01:30:02,580
I reject that out of hand.

1155
01:30:02,788 --> 01:30:07,272
All right, he's a patient to you,
I understand, but he's a good kid.

1156
01:30:07,376 --> 01:30:10,505
He loves bodybuilding.

1157
01:30:10,611 --> 01:30:13,115
He wants to be a bodybuilder.
Can you believe that?

1158
01:30:13,218 --> 01:30:15,826
He's funny. You'd like him.

1159
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:19,997
- You'd like him if you got to know him.
- I do like him.

1160
01:30:20,101 --> 01:30:23,541
Then, please, I'm just begging you,
step outside the rules.

1161
01:30:23,646 --> 01:30:27,819
I'd like to, John, I really would,
but what you're asking crosses the line.

1162
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:30,424
It is completely unethical.

1163
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:34,701
I'm crossing the line? You're crossing.
The whole system is crossing the line.

1164
01:30:34,806 --> 01:30:37,101
Maybe you don't understand
what I'm talking about.

1165
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:41,065
I don't give a damn.
My son's going to live.

1166
01:30:41,273 --> 01:30:45,651
Maybe you haven't figured that out by now.
I'll do whatever I got to do for him to live.

1167
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:50,345
What are you going to do,
shoot me if I don't operate?

1168
01:30:52,745 --> 01:30:54,726
I'm going to kill myself.

1169
01:30:56,602 --> 01:30:59,316
All right?
Let's just see what happens.

1170
01:30:59,837 --> 01:31:02,653
That's what this is about, right?
He needs a donor.

1171
01:31:02,756 --> 01:31:06,927
Somebody's got to die for him to live.
I'm his father. It's me.

1172
01:31:16,105 --> 01:31:18,921
- All right.
- All right what?

1173
01:31:19,026 --> 01:31:21,008
I'll do it, if that's what you want.

1174
01:31:21,112 --> 01:31:23,926
- You're going to let him kill himself?
- Once he's dead, why not?

1175
01:31:24,135 --> 01:31:26,430
You are the finest surgeon
I have ever known.

1176
01:31:26,534 --> 01:31:30,079
You cannot throw your career,
your life away for this.

1177
01:31:30,288 --> 01:31:33,836
- If you do this, you're finished.
- What are they going to do, sue me?

1178
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:35,817
Disbar me?

1179
01:31:36,024 --> 01:31:38,110
Evict me from the country club?

1180
01:31:38,321 --> 01:31:40,824
This is still a hospital.

1181
01:31:41,343 --> 01:31:45,099
If there's a heart available,
I'm not going to let it go to waste.

1182
01:31:45,308 --> 01:31:48,437
Doctor, Mr Maguire,
let's get ready for surgery.

1183
01:32:17,847 --> 01:32:21,184
- They're ready to harvest.
- All right, hurry up, guys.

1184
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:23,685
Get her on the table.

1185
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:26,608
- What's our time?
- All right, ready to lift.

1186
01:32:26,816 --> 01:32:29,631
- Count of three.
- Oh-four-five.

1187
01:32:33,491 --> 01:32:35,367
- Scalpels laid out.
- Where's his tray?

1188
01:32:35,472 --> 01:32:38,808
Got the other one ready?
Bring the cart around, please.

1189
01:32:44,544 --> 01:32:46,110
What do we have?

1190
01:32:46,318 --> 01:32:49,134
Female donor, 26 years old.

1191
01:32:49,238 --> 01:32:53,307
- She is 26 years old, 5'7".
- Liver, kidneys usable.

1192
01:32:53,412 --> 01:32:56,956
Liver and kidneys
are both usable. Lungs?

1193
01:32:58,102 --> 01:33:01,858
- Lungs are okay. Heart?
- Heart is good.

1194
01:33:01,963 --> 01:33:03,109
Blood type?

1195
01:33:04,569 --> 01:33:06,238
B-positive.

1196
01:33:09,575 --> 01:33:11,347
This is my...

1197
01:33:13,644 --> 01:33:14,792
...my will.

1198
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:21,777
It says I'm leaving my heart to my son,
and I need two witnesses to sign.

1199
01:33:21,881 --> 01:33:24,906
I'm not signing it.
I ain't going to watch you kill yourself.

1200
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:26,576
Me, neither.

1201
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,869
The sooner you sign it,
the sooner you go home.

1202
01:33:32,311 --> 01:33:35,230
- I'll sign.
- Me, too.

1203
01:33:45,242 --> 01:33:47,850
You're just going to go in there
and off yourself?

1204
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:50,770
- Only one thing will stop me.
- What's that?

1205
01:33:50,978 --> 01:33:52,648
If Mitch is B-positive.

1206
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:56,505
Type O. Swear to God.

1207
01:34:01,722 --> 01:34:03,075
Thank you.

1208
01:34:03,181 --> 01:34:05,788
You be good.
Be careful.

1209
01:34:18,617 --> 01:34:20,388
See you in the funny papers.

1210
01:34:30,296 --> 01:34:31,756
Can I have a word with him?

1211
01:34:35,304 --> 01:34:36,451
Thank you.

1212
01:35:14,725 --> 01:35:16,290
How you doing, buddy?

1213
01:35:19,002 --> 01:35:21,921
Did you find me a new heart?

1214
01:35:25,573 --> 01:35:30,058
We got you one.
I guess you got a guardian angel.

1215
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:34,851
Just try to stay awake
for a minute, okay?

1216
01:35:34,955 --> 01:35:37,878
I just need to tell you a few things.

1217
01:35:45,595 --> 01:35:48,726
You always listen to your mother.

1218
01:35:48,932 --> 01:35:50,915
You understand?

1219
01:35:51,019 --> 01:35:53,211
Do what she tells you to do.

1220
01:35:55,922 --> 01:35:58,005
She's your best friend.

1221
01:35:58,945 --> 01:36:01,239
You tell her you love her every day.

1222
01:36:06,766 --> 01:36:09,478
You're too young
for girls right now, but...

1223
01:36:11,251 --> 01:36:13,860
...there's going to come a time.

1224
01:36:13,962 --> 01:36:17,300
When it does,
you treat them like princesses.

1225
01:36:18,552 --> 01:36:20,325
'Cause that's what they are.

1226
01:36:24,392 --> 01:36:26,583
When you say
you're going to do something...

1227
01:36:42,852 --> 01:36:45,563
When you say you're going to
do something, you do it.

1228
01:36:48,171 --> 01:36:51,717
Because your word is your bond, son.
It's all you have.

1229
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:56,932
And money. You make money
if you get a chance,

1230
01:36:57,035 --> 01:36:59,122
even if you got to sell out
once in a while.

1231
01:36:59,226 --> 01:37:02,875
Make as much money as you can.
Don't be stupid like your father.

1232
01:37:03,814 --> 01:37:06,839
Everything is so much easier
with money, son.

1233
01:37:08,923 --> 01:37:10,280
Don't smoke.

1234
01:37:14,243 --> 01:37:16,852
Be kind to people.

1235
01:37:16,955 --> 01:37:18,833
When somebody chooses you...

1236
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:22,482
We talked about this.
You stand up. You be a man.

1237
01:37:26,861 --> 01:37:30,305
You stay away
from the bad things, son, please.

1238
01:37:31,972 --> 01:37:34,163
Don't get caught up
in the bad things.

1239
01:37:36,875 --> 01:37:39,586
There's so many great things
out there for you.

1240
01:37:49,702 --> 01:37:51,477
I'll never leave you.

1241
01:38:00,862 --> 01:38:02,531
I'm always with you.

1242
01:38:06,598 --> 01:38:08,162
Right there.

1243
01:38:14,211 --> 01:38:15,878
I love you, son.

1244
01:38:40,805 --> 01:38:42,475
I'll see you later.

1245
01:38:47,898 --> 01:38:49,463
Turner gets the other one.

1246
01:38:55,929 --> 01:38:57,804
Match with donor.

1247
01:39:06,879 --> 01:39:08,861
Oh, my sweet Jesus.

1248
01:39:24,190 --> 01:39:25,548
Let's do it.

1249
01:39:45,468 --> 01:39:49,325
Wait a minute. Are you telling me
that gun was empty the whole time?

1250
01:39:51,306 --> 01:39:52,455
I'm all talk.

1251
01:39:53,705 --> 01:39:56,207
The only one
I ever considered killing was me.

1252
01:40:11,957 --> 01:40:13,939
Maybe we should get some towels.

1253
01:40:16,545 --> 01:40:18,631
You're not going to believe this.
We got a match.

1254
01:40:18,839 --> 01:40:22,698
B-positive. Michael William Archibald,
the only status one in the country.

1255
01:40:22,907 --> 01:40:24,471
I'll be damned.

1256
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,165
I'm thirsty.

1257
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:56,490
We have very good news.

1258
01:41:08,275 --> 01:41:09,839
Jesus.

1259
01:41:15,887 --> 01:41:17,347
The safety's on.

1260
01:41:17,451 --> 01:41:19,745
- Is this for real?
- The jet landed at O'Hare.

1261
01:41:19,849 --> 01:41:22,771
The helicopter's
going to be here in 15 minutes.

1262
01:41:22,981 --> 01:41:25,795
You do the honours, okay? Go.

1263
01:41:30,383 --> 01:41:32,262
Baby. It's me.

1264
01:41:35,182 --> 01:41:36,954
It's not working.

1265
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:43,318
Please. Baby. Pick up.
John. Can you...

1266
01:42:02,923 --> 01:42:05,635
It's a miracle, baby!
They found a heart!

1267
01:42:09,598 --> 01:42:10,744
The heant is here!

1268
01:42:10,954 --> 01:42:14,081
I repeat... the heant for little
Mike Archibald has arrived.

1269
01:42:14,185 --> 01:42:18,046
What an unbelievable ending
to this incredible. Tumultuous day.

1270
01:42:18,150 --> 01:42:21,383
- There they are.
- Okay. Here we go.

1271
01:42:25,136 --> 01:42:27,431
Yes. The hostages
are coming out.

1272
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:29,727
One. Two.

1273
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:32,019
They appear to be unharmed
but centainly exhausted

1274
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:34,942
from what must have been
an excruciating ordeal.

1275
01:42:35,043 --> 01:42:38,381
More now! More coming out.
hands waving in the air.

1276
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:40,677
Freedom. Freedom at last.

1277
01:42:40,781 --> 01:42:43,180
Police are esconting them
one by one to safety.

1278
01:42:43,389 --> 01:42:45,891
- How do you feel?
- Somebody else is coming.

1279
01:42:45,995 --> 01:42:47,767
It's John Q.

1280
01:42:47,977 --> 01:42:49,855
John Q has come out.
hands in the air.

1281
01:42:50,064 --> 01:42:53,816
He's putting the gun down.
He appears to be surrendering.

1282
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:57,365
The police
are approaching cautiously now.

1283
01:42:57,469 --> 01:43:00,805
And they've got him.
They've subdued John Q.

1284
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:03,726
The handcuffs are on.
and it appears to be over.

1285
01:43:03,831 --> 01:43:05,811
It's all over.

1286
01:43:05,915 --> 01:43:11,027
If pictures speak a thousand words.
then these images do speak volumes.

1287
01:43:11,236 --> 01:43:14,574
And now. As the bloody standoff
comes to an end. We remind you

1288
01:43:14,677 --> 01:43:16,865
that Channel 8 News was here first

1289
01:43:16,970 --> 01:43:19,787
with exclusive
moment-to-moment live coverage

1290
01:43:19,994 --> 01:43:23,331
of "Crisis at Hope Memorial."

1291
01:43:23,437 --> 01:43:25,106
I'm Tuck Lampley.

1292
01:43:34,594 --> 01:43:36,266
Open those doors!

1293
01:43:36,476 --> 01:43:38,036
Look out!
We're coming through! Come on!

1294
01:43:47,944 --> 01:43:50,032
We love you, John!

1295
01:43:50,137 --> 01:43:52,848
God bless you!
I'd do the same thing!

1296
01:44:18,815 --> 01:44:19,858
Heart.

1297
01:44:22,153 --> 01:44:23,405
Thank you.

1298
01:44:26,219 --> 01:44:27,263
Metzenbaums.

1299
01:44:31,330 --> 01:44:32,790
Prepare for cutting.

1300
01:44:49,164 --> 01:44:52,084
Put these on for me,
would you do that?

1301
01:44:52,188 --> 01:44:53,858
Take your time.

1302
01:45:05,538 --> 01:45:06,581
Lift it.

1303
01:45:08,979 --> 01:45:11,900
All right, done.
How beautiful was that?

1304
01:45:12,108 --> 01:45:13,881
- Pressure up.
- Pressure up.

1305
01:45:14,819 --> 01:45:17,950
And now one, two, three.

1306
01:45:25,039 --> 01:45:26,188
It worked!

1307
01:45:40,789 --> 01:45:42,876
The other big story...
John Q goes on trial today

1308
01:45:42,979 --> 01:45:45,691
for kidnapping
and attempted murder charges

1309
01:45:45,795 --> 01:45:49,862
all because an HMO denied coverage
for his son's heant transplant.

1310
01:45:49,965 --> 01:45:53,825
... more expensive for you in the future.
HMOs. To deny coverage...

1311
01:45:54,033 --> 01:45:57,996
There are still 40 million Americans
who are uninsured...

1312
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:00,187
Tonight. As the trial continues.

1313
01:46:00,395 --> 01:46:04,881
John Quincy Archibald...
vigilante or heroic father?

1314
01:46:04,986 --> 01:46:09,574
... is to sue the pants off them
for millions of dollars to let them know...

1315
01:46:12,076 --> 01:46:16,144
We have known foryears
this is a crappy health care system.

1316
01:46:16,249 --> 01:46:18,438
We've known
we had to do something...

1317
01:46:18,542 --> 01:46:21,983
John Q was using one of those
faith-based health care plans.

1318
01:46:22,088 --> 01:46:24,800
You just pray.
and the government does nothing.

1319
01:46:25,008 --> 01:46:29,806
... not agree with that? The point is.
the enemy we're trying to identify is us.

1320
01:46:31,579 --> 01:46:33,456
We are the ones
who shot down national health care.

1321
01:46:33,558 --> 01:46:36,063
We are the ones
who don't want our taxes raised.

1322
01:46:36,168 --> 01:46:38,879
You have to look in the mirror
for this problem.

1323
01:46:41,485 --> 01:46:43,155
Back up. Come on.

1324
01:46:44,926 --> 01:46:46,805
Just one question, please!

1325
01:46:50,976 --> 01:46:52,750
How's your son doing, John?

1326
01:46:53,899 --> 01:46:55,670
A statement, please!

1327
01:46:55,774 --> 01:46:57,965
Out of the way.
Let's go.

1328
01:46:58,902 --> 01:47:02,449
- How are you feeling right now?
- Smile, John!

1329
01:47:17,779 --> 01:47:21,325
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honour.

1330
01:47:21,430 --> 01:47:24,663
As to count one,
attempted murder...

1331
01:47:24,767 --> 01:47:28,835
we find the defendant
John Quincy Archibald not guilty.

1332
01:47:31,025 --> 01:47:32,590
Quiet, please.

1333
01:47:32,695 --> 01:47:38,012
On count two,
armed criminal action... not guilty.

1334
01:47:39,056 --> 01:47:40,828
Quiet!

1335
01:47:41,037 --> 01:47:45,416
On the final count, the kidnapping
and false imprisonment

1336
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:49,067
of Julie Byrd, Max Conlan,

1337
01:47:49,171 --> 01:47:53,240
Rosa Gonzalez, Dr Allen Klein,

1338
01:47:53,344 --> 01:47:56,889
Lester Matthews, Steve Maguire,

1339
01:47:57,098 --> 01:48:02,208
Miriam and Steve Smith,
Dr Raymond Turner,

1340
01:48:02,312 --> 01:48:06,170
Mitch Quigley, Debby Utley,

1341
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:08,884
we find the defendant...

1342
01:48:08,988 --> 01:48:10,030
guilty.

1343
01:48:12,742 --> 01:48:15,975
Quiet, please. Sentencing will be
one week from today.

1344
01:48:17,017 --> 01:48:18,061
All rise.

1345
01:48:21,504 --> 01:48:24,943
- What are we looking at?
- He's going to do some time.

1346
01:48:25,046 --> 01:48:27,655
The judge is not going to give him
more than three to five.

1347
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,410
I'll try and get it down to two.
I'm sorry.

1348
01:48:35,061 --> 01:48:36,936
You all right, slugger?

1349
01:48:38,502 --> 01:48:42,257
You take good care of your mother, okay?
You're the man of the house now.

1350
01:48:42,361 --> 01:48:46,114
You have any problems,
Jimmy and Gina will be here for you, too.

1351
01:48:59,047 --> 01:49:01,031
I'm so proud of you.

1352
01:49:06,661 --> 01:49:08,955
Give them frigging hell, Johnny.
Don't worry about nothing.

1353
01:49:15,006 --> 01:49:16,672
It's not good-bye, son.

1354
01:49:18,654 --> 01:49:19,906
See you later.

1355
01:49:43,476 --> 01:49:46,918
Take care, man.
You my hero.

1356
01:50:25,088 --> 01:50:26,028
Thank you.
