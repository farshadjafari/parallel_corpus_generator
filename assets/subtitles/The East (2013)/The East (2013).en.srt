3
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,638
<i>Your kids, your wife.</i>

4
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,099
<i>But when it's your fault...</i>

5
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,102
<i>...it shouldn't be so
easy to sleep at night.</i>

6
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,980
<i>Especially when we know where you live.</i>

7
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,900
<i>Barry Redmond, CEO of Lorex Oil.</i>

8
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,571
<i>2641 River Rock Road, East Hampton.</i>

9
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:15,742
<i>You dumped fifteen million barrels of
crude into the Atlantic.</i>

10
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,661
<i>We don't care how rich you are.</i>

11
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,749
<i>We want all those who are guilty
to experience the terror of their crimes.</i>

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,294
<i>Because it shouldn't be
so easy to get away with murder.</i>

13
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,589
<i>Lie to us... we'll lie to you.</i>

14
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,759
<i>Spy on us... we'll spy on you.</i>

15
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,969
<i>Poison our habitat...</i>

16
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,055
<i>...we'll poison yours.</i>

17
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,559
<i>We are The East
and this is just the beginning.</i>

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,771
<i>We will counterattack three corporations...</i>

19
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,190
<i>...in the next six months
for their worldwide terrorism.</i>

20
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,685
No matter what happens today,
you're still a winner to me.

21
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,688
I'm only a winner if I get it.

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,483
Your mysterious assignment.

23
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,949
I think I knew more about you
when you worked for the FBI.

24
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,040
Want to meet at Clyde's after work
and watch the game?

25
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,793
You're on.

26
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,462
Wish me luck.

27
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,118

29
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,625
Hello, Jane. Good to see you.

30
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,335
Good morning.

31
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,554
Jane?

32
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,056
Sharon's ready for you.

33
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,318
Who would you choose?

34
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,237
Me.

35
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,322
I'm unexpected.

36
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,534
Being unexpected
is the only advantage that matters.

37
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,330
But you chose Tom.

38
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,833
Why do you say that?

39
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,628
He's your last interview.

40
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,800
You remind me of myself at your age.

41
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,928
Smart enough for it to be a disadvantage.

42
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,224
You haven't failed
at anything yet... not really.

43
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,729
That kind of arrogance is dangerous.
They'd smell it on you.

44
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:35,233
I've been researching this field
exclusively for nine months.

45
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,987
You had a goldfish as a kid?

46
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,700
- Sure.
- You remember taking it home?

47
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,703
You had to float the bag in the aquarium...

48
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:51,332
...gradually letting the water in
little by little, so the fish can adjust.

49
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,126
Okay.

50
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,547
Don't follow your ego out of the bag early.

51
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,092
That's how you end up dead.

52
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,315
You put your first choice in the middle.

53
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,069
Because to put it last is expected.

54
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,643
<i>Talk to your doctor to see

55
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,436

58
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,737

00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,486
<i>Welcome to Washington Dulles

61
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:48,158
I was thinking maybe
when you get back from Dubai...

62
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,745
- ...maybe you and I...
- Tim?

63
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,708
Can we just see if I can
pull this off first?

64
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,628
Yeah.

65
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,469
I'm going to miss you.

66
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,768
Text me when you land?

67

<i>This is the final boarding call

72

Anti-corporate terrorism is all about risk.

73
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,828
Our job is to assess that risk for you.

74
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,914
Are you dealing with a fly?

75
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,458
It's harmless, easily swatted.

76
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,128
<i>Or is it a mosquito?</i>

77
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,338
<i>Can it draw blood?</i>

78
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,633
Or... is the threat the black widow?

79
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,554
<i>Sending you to the hospital,
crashing your stock.</i>

80
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,767
Let's say it's a fly.
You deal with it internally.

81
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,937
<i>Mosquito, our operative handles it...</i>

82
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,815
<i>...neutralizing the threat. Now...</i>

83

...if it's the black widow...

84
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,112
...we'll have to see.

85
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,534
<i>We can extract our operative,

Gentlemen, we are in thirty-two countries,
protecting your good names.

87
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,919
Which is why it is essential
very few have ever heard of ours.

88
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,846
<i>Please give me the strength to do well.</i>

89
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,224
<i>To not be arrogant.</i>

90
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,021
<i>But to not be weak.</i>

91
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,988
Amen.

92
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,703
Hi. Checking in.

93
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,205
<i>Where are you?</i>

94
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,916
Delaware Seashore State Park.
I've been sleeping here.

95
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,417
<i>How'd you get there?</i>

96
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,628
Rideshares off Craigslist.

97
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,630
<i>Smart. Any luck?</i>

98
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,801
No. Building confidence. Meeting dropouts,
counterculture types, freegans.

99
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,636
<i>Have fun.</i>

100
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,847
<i>You get any matches on the pictures

101
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,226
<i>Just dead ends. If any of these kids

102
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,437
<i>...covering their online footprint.</i>

103
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,024
<i>I haven't met anyone
even close to that sophisticated.</i>

104
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,317
<i>What about Trevor Landen?</i>

105
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,820
<i>Served a year for ski resort vandalism.</i>

106
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,573
<i>Facebook links him to
the Katrina Anarchist Kitchen.</i>

107
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,702
I saw him again last night.

108
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,663
He mentioned hopping to Pittsburgh.

109
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,623
I'll check him out.

110
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:11,504
<i>Anti-corporate activism initially surfaced

111
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,673
<i>...but now more radical cells,
like The East...</i>

112
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,307
It's picking up speed.

113
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,809
I'm looking for The East tag.

114
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,772
I've heard folks from
The East hop out in Pittsburgh.

115
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,607
I heard The East doesn't exist.

116
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,283
<i>Said I ain't no doctor</i>

117
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,703
<i>Ain't no doctor's son</i>

118
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,291
<i>Said I ain't no doctor</i>

119
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,211
<i>Ain't no doctor's son</i>

120
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,882
<i>But I'll cling to him</i>

121
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,510
<i>Until the doctor come</i>

122
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,941
Everybody out! Move it now!

123
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,360
Let's go! Get up!

124
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,154
Move it, move it. Come on.

125
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,490
Move! Let's go!

126
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,867
Get off my train!

127
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,160
Let's go.

128
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,164
That means you, too, you dirty queer!

129
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,583
We're moving out.

130
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,504
Wipe that off your face.

131
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,381
No one's being violent.

132
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,299
Hey, that's a girl, you animal!

133
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,759
Who gives a shit?

134
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,971
Who the hell are you?
I'm cuffing you till the cops get here.

135
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,642
Come on, come on.

136
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,565
What are you doing?!

137
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,778
Stop, you stinking trash!

138
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,041
Come on. Get in.

139
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,923
Go, go, go.

140
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,555
Are you hurt?

141
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,935
- I can help you.
- No, I'm okay. Just hungry.

142
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,521
<i>I know a good place to eat.</i>

143
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,710
Eat these. You need some sugar.

144
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,754
I'm going to dive the next one. Stay here.

145
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,694
Trevor was a fed.

146
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,988
I've been following a fed.

147
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,531
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

148
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,825

<i>What are you going to do?</i>

150
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,833
I'm going to check into a hotel.
Take a shower.

151
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,045
<i>Jane?</i>

152
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,838
Let me call you back.

153
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:17,852
They're good, yeah?

154
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,690
Let me see that arm.

155
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,483
- No, I'm fine.
- Hold on.

156
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,487
Is that from the fence?

157
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,490
You need stitches.

158
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,702
I can't go to a hospital.

159
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,716
Do you have a phone?

160
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,357
You only have nine numbers.

161
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,285
- What are you doing?
- You want our help?

162
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,578
Don't...

163
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,582
<i>Hello?</i>

164
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,504
Sarah, are you there?

165
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,302
<i>Just say something, honey,
so I know you're okay.</i>

166
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,807
<i>The dogs miss you.</i>

167
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,563
All right, I'll talk and you can listen.

168
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,275
<i>You don't have to say anything
if you don't want to.</i>

169
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,362
<i>Sarah...</i>

170
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:53,948
<i>Sarah?</i>

171
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:08,857
What is this, Luca?
I thought you were scavenging for the jam.

172
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,942
I was. She's in trouble, dude.

173
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,736
No, Luca, she needs to go.

174
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,071
She needs to see Doc.

175
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,282
You should talk to Benji first.

176
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,370
Doc?

177
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:28,585
This is Sarah. She slipped the cops.
She's got a bad gash.

178
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,171
Benji know?

179
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,721
Sit down.

180
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,938
Drink this. It'll numb the pain.

181
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,151
I'm okay.

182
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,737
It's no chemical. Purely vegetal.

183
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,972
- What is that?
- Superglue.

184
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,266
That doesn't seem safe.

185
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,561
It's a trick I learned in med school.
It's perfectly safe.

186
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,271
You're a real doctor.

187
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,690
Sort of.

188
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,739
Most people don't like to look.

189
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,950
I'm looking because I don't want to.

190
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,796
My uncle has Parkinson's.

191
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,881
That's not Parkinson's.

192
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:02,846
I was in Kenya as an aid worker
and I took an antibiotic called Denoxin.

193
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,848
Had an adverse reaction.

194
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,814
Snapped tendons, seizures, brain damage.

195
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,233
From an antibiotic?

196
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,820
Did you sue them?

197
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:23,700
Oh, no. Those side effects
are listed on the side of the bottle.

198
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:25,744
That's how they rape you.

199
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,204
In broad daylight.

200
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:44,012
I feel... I feel dizzy. Do you have water?

201
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,722
Just relax. Don't fight it.

202
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:52,979
Don't fight it.

203
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:56,900
Don't fight it.

204
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:07,869
You smell like soap.

205
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,416
I snuck into a hotel.

206
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,293
I'm just here to watch you.

207
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,506
I snuck into a hotel.

208
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:23,718
Who's deaf in your family?

209
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,762
No one.

210
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,182
My friend growing up.

211
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,267
What's your name?

212
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,064
Sarah.

213
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,191
I'm Eve.

214
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:45,824
Sometimes

215
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,367
living like

216
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,245
a stray dog

217
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:51,705
sucks.

218
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:59,713
We've been squatting here
for three months. It's nice.

219
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,966
Benji doesn't like to stay
in one place that long.

220
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,801
Who's...

221
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,595
- ...Benji?
- You'll meet him.

222
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,765
Benji made me speak.

223
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,352
He told me I was waking people up...

224
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,271
...with my voice.

225
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:24,154
You have to put this on.

226
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,702
I'm not wearing that.

227
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:34,372
If you want to come to dinner,
you wear this.

228
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,725
Sarah Moss from Arizona.

229
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,854
Who used to work in an office
but is now a traveler.

230
00:23:58,646 --> 00:23:59,939
Sit.

231
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,044
Since you're new...

232
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,672
...we'll wait till you begin.

233
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:34,015
I've never eaten this way before.

234
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:37,352
Do as you wish,
but we'd rather wait till you begin.

235
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,554
There's no wrong way.

236
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,009
What are you doing?

237
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:36,179
I'm going to hitch a ride.

238
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,767
I can't let you leave on your own.

239
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:44,187
Luca will drive you back
to wherever he picked you up.

240
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,983
Come get something to eat before you go.

241
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:52,404
So you can keep making
an example of me to your followers?

242
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:53,905
I have no followers.

243
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:56,533
Well, I think you all made your point.

244
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:58,785
Really?

245
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:02,414
What do you think we figured out?

246
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,874
That I'm selfish.

247
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,002
Maybe that's what you figured out.

248
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,217
Why does self-righteousness
always go hand-in-hand...

249
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,844
...with resistance movements?

250
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,681
I don't know.

251
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,394
I hear you got in some kind of trouble.

252
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:25,854
I can handle myself.

253
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,731
So why come here?

254
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,774
I was hurt. There was a doctor.

255
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,485
And now you're better.

256
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,655
So you should go.

257
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,704
You wouldn't like
what you find here anyway.

258
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:43,788
What?

259
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:47,083
I said, you wouldn't like
what you find here, anyway.

260
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:48,877
Why?

261
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:50,879
Because this is the end of the road.

262
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:52,797
There's nowhere to hide.

263
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,883
And I'm not tough enough for the truth.

264
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,844
No. I think you're not soft enough for it.

265
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:02,349
No one should be by the road.

266
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,352
She's right.

267
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,729
Let's go back inside.

268
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,481
Not her.

269
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,150
Who is she?

270
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:14,486
Who are you?

271
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:15,945
I'm Sarah.

272
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,281
Who are you?

273
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,492
- Drive her back.
- Izzy.

274
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:25,163
She took a punch for me today
and fought off a bull.

275
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,582
Since when do we turn away outlaws?

276
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,170
Two nights.

277
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,173
That's it.

278
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:53,858
Can we get a hand?

279
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,617
Found her shot dead in the woods.

280
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,744
Thrill kill.

281
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:06,955
Idiots.

282
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:10,583
The best way to honor her
is to not let her go to waste.

283
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:16,673
You can remove the innards.

284
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:29,936
Cut along here.

285
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,440
Slow.

286
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,819
Slow.

287
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,155
Slowly.

288
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:47,162
More to the left.

289
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,248
Not that far!

290
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,804
Intestine got clipped.

291
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,016
That's just shit you're smelling.

292
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:25,658
Every day our society
abuses the environment.

293
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,161
What's the easiest way to handle that pain?

294
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:29,746
Never talk about it.

295
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:30,830
Yep.

296
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,667
To bury the horror, pretend it isn't real.

297
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,543
If it's real, you have to do something.

298
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,045
Like this deer.

299
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:38,588
Someone hurt her.

300
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,049
Someone you trusted, because...

301
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:44,761
...you trusted the system, trusted
the government, trusted the church.

302
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,221
Please stop talking about it.

303
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:54,604
Feel her.

304
00:30:57,607 --> 00:31:00,110
Feel the last of her living parts.

305
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,100
What if they share?

306
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,186
People don't share champagne.

307
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,749
- Champagne, sir?
- May I have your glass?

308
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:46,758
Enjoy.

309
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,183
Champagne, sir?

310
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:57,394
Doc!

311
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,396
He's having a seizure!

312
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,065
Get away.

313
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,493
Doc, we're all here for you.

314
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:14,869
Relax.

315
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,666
Don't say another word.

316
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,502
The stress of all this
is too much for his system.

317
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,005
What if this happens when we're there?

318
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:28,967
Why?

319
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:30,010
I'm

320
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,720
undercover.

321
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,597
Do you know what happens

322
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,016
to terrorists these days?

323
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:37,475
I'm not a terrorist.

324
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:39,519
Life

325
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:41,312
in prison.

326
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,858
He's back.

327
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:46,776
He's back.

328
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,279
- Hey, Doc.
- Doc, are you okay?

329
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:51,281
Sit up.

330
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,450
I know

331
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:54,576
Eve

332
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:55,952
is not your real name.

333
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,538
No one uses their real name.

334
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:08,465
J - E - S - S - I - C - A

335
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:10,091
JESSICA

336
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,844
How do you know that name?

337
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:14,054
I know

338
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,597
a lot

339
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,599
about you.

340
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:20,643
One, two, three.

341
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,480
Let's get him back inside. We're done.

342
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:24,647
Where's Eve?

343
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:28,068
- Don't tell them. Don't.
- Where did she go?

344
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:31,571
Jessica.

345
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,698
Don't throw

346
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:35,116
everything away

347
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,284
because these people

348
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:37,702
have convinced you

349
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:39,704
that no one

350
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:41,831
could love you

351
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,083
but them.

352
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:45,669
- Where did she go?
- Eve!

353
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,348
Eve, you have to stay focused,
even when shit hits the fan.

354
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:01,351
I had to take a piss. Relax.

355
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:20,370
- What did Eve mean?
- I'm not sure, but her stuff is gone.

356
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:24,958
I knew it.

357
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,168
Eve's chickenshit.

358
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,379
Better to know now than later.

359
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:31,673
This always happens.

360
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,718
And you always act so surprised.

361
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:39,014
When it comes to actually breaking
the law, most people can't handle it.

362
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:43,435
We shouldn't have given an important role
to a 22-year-old deaf girl.

363
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:44,602
We don't need Eve.

364
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:48,732
- We can do it without her.
- I disagree. It's too risky.

365
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,651
He's a child. He needs distraction.

366
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:56,656
Don't look at me. I'm not an option.

367
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,452
What was Eve supposed to do?

368
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:06,708
- Maybe I can do it.
- No.

369
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,126
No.

370
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,754
- You can't.
- Why not?

371
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:12,922
She only needs to know her part.

372
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:17,427
You'd only know your role, right before
you do it. Would you be up for that?

373
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,686
You helped me when I needed it.

374
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:28,688
I'll help you.

375
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:31,107
Are you serious?

376
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:34,235
There are consequences.

377
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:35,695
I know.

378
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:37,447
I'll do it.

379
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:41,242
It's not a good idea. She can't do it.

380
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:44,829
Sorry.

381
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:47,665
All in favor?

382
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,491
So if anything goes wrong, we split up...

383
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:47,702
...go back to the streets. Lawyer's number?

384
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:51,706
212-555-0106.

385
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:05,553
You only have one job on this jam.

386
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:08,765
Keep your mark engaged in you and not us.

387
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:10,934
Okay?

388
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:13,770
He's a sex addict, so...

389
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:17,357
...you have that in your favor.

390
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:30,161
Thomas, you son of a bitch!

391
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:32,580
You a famous doctor yet?

392
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:37,752
Peter. This is Sarah,
the girl I told you about.

393
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:39,504
Very nice. Want a lick?

394
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:42,716
In this weather? I'll pass.

395
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:45,635
- You're not deaf.
- No, that was a joke.

396
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:49,931
You're a sick dude. I love it.
You got nasty in Africa, didn't you?

397
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:52,767
At Groton, this guy's name
comes up all the time.

398
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:56,271
Tommy wins this award,
Tommy's banging so-and-so.

399
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:58,773
The past few years,
I haven't heard the name.

400
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:02,277
Which is, frankly, quite a relief.
I feel like less of a loser.

401
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:07,365
Porty, my two friends I was telling
you about, Edward and Isabella.

402
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,743
Porty McCabe. Porty McCabe.

403
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:11,870
Tommy, you're kind of rolling deep.

404
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,581
I mentioned them in my email.

405
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:16,958
Porty, come on.

406
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,376
Tommy.

407
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,878
I'm sorry.

408
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:21,713
They're my friends.

409
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:24,132
I thought it was a party.

410
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,343
It is, it is.

411
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,347
But it's kind of a work party. So it's...

412
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,560
You brought us to a work party?

413
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:41,149
Yeah, yeah, but it'll be fine.
It'll be fine, come on.

414
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:42,942
Come on!

415
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:52,577
You're protecting the jam. I get it. But...

416
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:55,872
...I don't want to mess this up because
I don't know what's going on.

417
00:40:56,164 --> 00:41:00,251
You're doing fine. Just don't leave the tent.
Keep Porty occupied.

418
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:03,254
And don't drink the champagne.

419
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:05,590
I have to go.

420
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:07,717
Can I get you a drink?

421
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:10,804
- No, I'm great.
- You are great, aren't you?

422
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:13,723
I guess a match isn't in our future.

423
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,433
I like hard courts.

424
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:17,936
You're too young to know better.

425
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:21,022
Edward, this is Rory Houston.

426
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,024
He's on Mr. McCabe's board.

427
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,819
Nice meeting you, sir. Edward Eneicher.

428
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:29,823
I didn't realize you had a glass, honey.

429
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:32,450
Want some champagne?

430
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:34,619
Thank you.

431
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:38,873
Have you felt the fake grass courts
with your bare feet?

432
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:40,625
It's impossible to tell the difference.

433
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:44,963
That's why there's such a fervent
pro-life movement in this country.

434
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:46,589
I don't follow.

435
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:50,010
Everything else is dead or dying.

436
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:53,221
Even the grass is fake.

437
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,516
We should probably go find...

438
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:58,935
- Porty.
- Excuse us.

439
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:04,607
Cool it.

440
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:11,656
Here you go.

441
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,618
Bob, Sarah. This is my stepfather.
This is his party.

442
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,913
Robert. Is this your friend
from boarding school?

443
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:21,458
I went to public school.

444
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,545
Me, too. I believe in pulling yourself up
by your bootstraps.

445
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:28,631
Nothing to stop you
but laziness and terrorism.

446
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:31,634
Where did you find this firecracker?

447
00:42:33,511 --> 00:42:37,098
It's nice to see so many people in uniform.
You're in the military?

448
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:39,601
I work in the private sector now.

449
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:43,688
Robert is being modest.
He's the McCabe in McCabe-Grey.

450
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:47,108
The pharmaceutical company.

451
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:49,069
Excuse me.

452
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:53,698
Sir?

453
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:58,244
Can I use your phone?

454
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:03,917
Yes, but this one's actually dying.
I have one in my room.

455
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:06,628
You want to...? Wonderful.

456
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:08,171
This way.

457
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,407
Just a minute!

458
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:53,174
Our Vice President, Paige Williams.

459
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:56,386
Tonight we're happy to announce...

460
00:43:56,803 --> 00:44:00,765
...the government will be supplying
our miracle drug, Denoxin...

461
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:05,270
...to every man and woman in uniform.

462
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:11,067
Allow me to introduce our CEO...

463
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:15,196
...who has led this particular charge
and welcomed us into his home.

464
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,614
Mr. Robert McCabe.

465
00:44:17,657 --> 00:44:19,284
Thank you, Paige.

466
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:33,631
It's me. Can you hear me?

467
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:36,343
- Where are you?<i>
- Cape Cod.</i>

468
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:40,138
I'm at the home of
the CEO of McCabe-Grey.

469
00:44:40,555 --> 00:44:43,725
I think they're poisoning
the company with their own drug.

470
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:45,560
<i>- When?
- Right now.</i>

471
00:44:46,811 --> 00:44:49,731
- What's the potential damage?<i>
- I don't know.</i>

472
00:44:50,648 --> 00:44:54,444
But the side effects seem severe.
There are families downstairs.

473
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:56,654
You talking to your boyfriend?

474
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:01,451
<i>You there?</i>

475
00:45:01,534 --> 00:45:05,914
It wouldn't be on the market
if it were life threatening, okay?

476
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:08,333
No, just listen.

477
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,836
Stay calm. You hold your cover.

478
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:14,214
<i>That's our asset.</i>

479
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:18,885
But people could get hurt.
I have no idea...

480
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,595
<i>...what the dosage is.</i>

481
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:23,515
McCabe-Grey is not my client.

482
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,743
Better? Who were you talking to?

483
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:45,620
Told my mom we got here safely.

484
00:45:45,912 --> 00:45:48,915
A little old to be checking in with Mom,
don't you think?

485
00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:52,502
- I came up here to use your phone.
- Yeah, you did.

486
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:53,712
Where you going?

487
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:55,672
Stop. Stop!

488
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:57,507
Calm down!

489
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:12,605
Tonight marks a special occasion...

490
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:15,692
...in the McCabe-Grey family with
this announcement.

491
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:19,988
It warms my heart to be surrounded
by so many familiar faces...

492
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,407
...at our party.

493
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:25,118
At McCabe-Grey, we always ask...

494
00:46:26,202 --> 00:46:28,413
...how can we keep people healthy...

495
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:31,708
...so they can enjoy their lives
to the fullest?

496
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:35,420
- I'd like to refresh your glass for you.
- And among those we care about most...

497
00:46:35,503 --> 00:46:37,630
...are our young men and women
in the Armed Forces.

498
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:40,300
Hi, I'll bring a new
glass in just a second.

499
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,594
I'll take that for you.

500
00:46:43,803 --> 00:46:46,681
Pardon me. Let me take that, thank you.

501
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:49,684
Protecting them from
Third World diseases...

502
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:52,771
...and biochemical agents
such as anthrax...

503
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:56,524
...allowing them to continue bringing
freedom and democracy...

504
00:46:57,692 --> 00:47:00,487
...to the darkest regions of the world.

505
00:47:01,279 --> 00:47:02,697
To them...

506
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:04,866
...and to us.

507
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:41,986
I'm sorry we couldn't tell you before
we started. It must have been hard.

508
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:48,576
What's going to happen to those people?

509
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,786
Nothing.

510
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:52,288
If their drug is as safe as they claim.

511
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:55,959
But you know Porty.

512
00:47:58,628 --> 00:48:01,339
Couldn't you have just
talked to his stepdad?

513
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:02,674
Please.

514
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,721
They make $1.4 billion
a year off of Denoxin alone.

515
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:09,848
They don't give a shit.

516
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:12,726
Maybe, but wouldn't people know about it?

517
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:16,855
Doc...

518
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:19,065
...tell her.

519
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:24,738
She deserves to know.

520
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:27,949
Tell her everything.

521
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:37,959
My sister traveled with me
to do aid work in Kenya.

522
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:43,340
She took Denoxin.
I prescribed it as an anti-malarial.

523
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:48,178
Some weeks later,
she woke up one morning...

524
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:50,722
...and didn't recognize
her face in the mirror.

525
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:58,730
The drug I had prescribed...

526
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:02,609
...had damaged her brain.

527
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:05,945
It's a condition known as prosopagnosia.

528
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:09,449
No one believed it was the Denoxin, but...

529
00:49:09,824 --> 00:49:12,660
...I prescribed myself the same drug.

530
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:14,746
And day by day...

531
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:18,625
...my mind and body deteriorate.

532
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:25,590
She killed herself some months later.

533
00:49:38,603 --> 00:49:40,605
We are The East.

534
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:44,025
And we are your wakeup call.

535
00:49:45,443 --> 00:49:47,612
And we are not hiding from you.

536
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:49,447
We are you.

537
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:55,245
We are the morning you got off the
treadmill and ran under the open sky.

538
00:49:56,162 --> 00:49:58,957
We're the first time you kissed someone
and they kissed you back.

539
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:03,336
<i>We are the night you couldn't sleep.</i>

540
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:07,799
<i>The night you stared at the ceiling,
thinking, "Is this it?</i>

541
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:10,552
<i>"Is this the best life has to offer?"</i>

542
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:13,013
<i>No.</i>

543
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:17,434
<i>There is a freedom in you
that knows no fear.</i>

544
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,023
<i>Last night, we gave
pharmaceutical giant McCabe-Grey...</i>

545
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:25,942
<i>...a taste of their best-selling poison,
Denoxin.</i>

546
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:31,531
<i>We encourage the media to follow
the company's members.</i>

547
00:50:31,614 --> 00:50:35,618
<i>We will counterattack
two more corporations for their injustice.</i>

548
00:50:35,952 --> 00:50:37,662
<i>We will not show mercy.</i>

549
00:52:37,615 --> 00:52:41,786
So you spin the bottle.
Whoever it lands on is your partner.

550
00:52:42,203 --> 00:52:45,123
You ask them permission
for what you want to do.

551
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:49,669
Like, "Can I shake your hand?"
And they'll say, "Yeah", or...

552
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:51,588
..."No, I'd rather not."

553
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:54,507
Or they'll pose an alternative, like...

554
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:57,761
..."Why don't we high
five?" Or something.

555
00:52:59,387 --> 00:53:00,638
Here you go.

556
00:53:17,864 --> 00:53:20,658
Can Thumbs and I hug you for one minute?

557
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:24,662
All right.

558
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:31,586
Come on.

559
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:37,050
This is ridiculous.

560
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:56,486
Thank you.

561
00:54:08,748 --> 00:54:11,918
I would like you and Thumbs
to hug me for one minute.

562
00:54:23,638 --> 00:54:25,640
Can I kiss your belly button?

563
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,561
You may.

564
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:41,156
Thank you.

565
00:54:49,247 --> 00:54:50,665
Can I kiss you?

566
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,427
Oh, that's good.

567
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:14,439
Can I kiss you?

568
00:55:19,652 --> 00:55:21,446
Okay. You may.

569
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,148
Can I kiss you?

570
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:03,113
Can we hug instead?

571
00:56:05,323 --> 00:56:06,533
Sure.

572
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:23,299
I can't believe these were
going to a landfill.

573
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:26,011
Tess.

574
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,430
- Where'd you harvest?
- Hartford.

575
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:30,432
New apples come in, old ones are dumped.

576
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:32,892
Give me a hand?

577
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:47,699
Where's Benji been?

578
00:56:49,534 --> 00:56:51,119
He sometimes takes days to himself.

579
00:56:51,661 --> 00:56:52,662
Guys?

580
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:56,207
You should see this.

581
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:01,796
<i>Shocking news Friday that the board of
McCabe-Grey...</i>

582
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,798
<i>...had been drugged by a terrorist group...</i>

583
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:07,302
<i>...calling themselves The East.
McCabe-Grey Vice President...</i>

584
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:10,180
<i>...Paige Williams spoke to reporters today.</i>

585
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:13,099
I had a bad rash
and a nasty stomach ache...

586
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:17,771
...but those are mild side effects
for a drug that has...

587
00:57:18,188 --> 00:57:21,775
...and will continue to save
thousands of lives.

588
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:26,821
As you can see, I'm in perfect health,
so we at McCabe-Grey...

589
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:30,784
...are glad to be given a taste of
our own medicine. It tastes great.

590
00:57:31,117 --> 00:57:32,911
We should have used the higher dose.

591
00:57:34,371 --> 00:57:37,624
They've paid hackers to break
the encryption on my last video.

592
00:57:37,707 --> 00:57:38,667
They won't break it, but...

593
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,585
- You don't know that.
- I do.

594
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,879
Mine makes theirs look like pig Latin.

595
00:57:43,296 --> 00:57:46,174
We still have two more jams
before we leave.

596
00:57:46,716 --> 00:57:51,721
I think we should let other collectives draw
some attention first, and cool out for a bit.

597
00:57:52,597 --> 00:57:53,598
I agree.

598
00:57:56,768 --> 00:57:57,769
Let's break for a while.

599
00:57:58,311 --> 00:58:01,690
It's a good opportunity to keep up cover
on the outside, for those of us who do.

600
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:04,484
If you like it better, stay.

601
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,821
If not...

602
00:58:09,698 --> 00:58:10,865
...come back.

603
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,284
We have a lot of work to do.

604
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:23,461
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
next and final stop, Union Station.</i>

605
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:27,799
<i>Watch your step as you exit the train.
Thank you for choosing Amtrak.</i>

606
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:04,252
Wow.

607
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:06,546
Your hair.

608
00:59:08,548 --> 00:59:10,717
I didn't even recognize you.

609
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:19,559
How was Dubai?

610
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:24,147
Can we not talk about it?

611
00:59:28,151 --> 00:59:30,737
So you missed me a little bit?

612
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:35,700
Excited to sleep in your own bed?

613
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,343
Mr. Douglas, step aside
for additional screening.

614
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,720
Hello, Jane. Good to see you back.

615
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:01,976
The group says they have two jams left...

616
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,313
...until they disappear and resurface with
a larger organization.

617
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:06,773
How will they do that?

618
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:08,358
There's a girl they call Tess.

619
01:00:08,441 --> 01:00:11,528
She's interfacing with other cells
in the deep Web.

620
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:13,029
What cells?

621
01:00:13,321 --> 01:00:17,117
We assume other likeminded groups.
But we don't know who or where.

622
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:21,663
We need to start information sharing with
the Bureau to cover ourselves.

623
01:00:21,746 --> 01:00:25,959
You've been in the field quite some time.
There are too many unanswered questions.

624
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:27,669
Too many questions.

625
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:31,965
Understood, but we were able to identify
two key members.

626
01:00:32,298 --> 01:00:34,300
That's William Woodhouse III.

627
01:00:34,592 --> 01:00:36,177
We're waiting on real estate records...

628
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:39,681
...but we think it's his property the group
thinks they're squatting on.

629
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:44,894
Using Stanford medical records,
we were able to identify Dr. Thomas Ayers.

630
01:00:44,978 --> 01:00:47,814
That is his current Facebook page.

631
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:50,817
"Mimi" is a fake profile.

632
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:55,196
That's how 450 friends think
they're in touch with you...

633
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:58,116
...when no one has actually seen you
for years.

634
01:01:03,663 --> 01:01:06,750
<i>Okay, Bob, exactly what
are we talking about?</i>

635
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:09,836
<i>We're talking about a class of drugs...</i>

636
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:12,630
It seems so loud.

637
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:17,052
You usually ask me to turn it up.

638
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:27,604
You okay?

639
01:01:27,854 --> 01:01:30,482
Just jet lag. I'm just tired.

640
01:01:43,828 --> 01:01:47,457
I know you're not allowed
to talk about what's happening...

641
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:49,834
...but do you want to...

642
01:01:50,669 --> 01:01:53,254
...talk to me about how you feel?

643
01:01:56,257 --> 01:01:58,677
Like I've been in a foreign country.

644
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:04,140
But I was there for such a long time that
it all started to feel really familiar.

645
01:02:04,557 --> 01:02:06,351
So when I came home...

646
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:09,771
...it feels like a foreign country, too.

647
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:17,779
That's hard.

648
01:02:18,738 --> 01:02:20,573
Yeah, it sucks.

649
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:27,539
Maybe we can make something
familiar for dinner tonight.

650
01:02:28,748 --> 01:02:31,918
To welcome you back into this country.

651
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:34,838
Like what?

652
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:36,923
Like spaghetti and meatballs.

653
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:38,466
Really?

654
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:40,135
Okay, yeah.

655
01:02:40,468 --> 01:02:43,638
Or, we can go to the store
together and find...

656
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:45,932
What's she saying?

657
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:47,851
Turn it up!

658
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:49,144
Why?

659
01:02:52,564 --> 01:02:53,732
<i>And...</i>

660
01:02:55,358 --> 01:02:57,152
<i>...I don't know, it's hard...</i>

661
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:03,033
<i>It's hard to communicate
what it feels like to have...</i>

662
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:07,620
<i>...your mind and your body taken hostage.</i>

663
01:03:08,538 --> 01:03:10,749
<i>And I don't just mean...</i>

664
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:15,211
<i>...my body. I mean, my mind.</i>

665
01:03:16,212 --> 01:03:19,799
<i>My mind, I feel different. I feel...</i>

666
01:03:23,428 --> 01:03:27,223
<i>I don't feel...
I don't recognize myself in the mirror.</i>

667
01:03:31,644 --> 01:03:35,023
<i>I used to hear about their stories.</i>

668
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:37,609
How do they let this stuff on the market?

669
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:41,029
Oh, my God.

670
01:03:42,238 --> 01:03:44,824
We never took any of that stuff, did we?

671
01:03:45,116 --> 01:03:48,703
No. I checked your medical records.
I forgot something at work...

672
01:03:48,995 --> 01:03:51,706
...so I have to run to the office.
I'll stop at the store on my way home.

673
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:54,417
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

674
01:03:56,419 --> 01:03:58,338
<i>I do love to be proven wrong.</i>

675
01:03:59,214 --> 01:04:00,882
<i>When you came to me...</i>

676
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:04,094
...with those videos
and wanted to start a file on those kids...

677
01:04:04,427 --> 01:04:07,013
...I thought I'd recruited
another Bureau idiot.

678
01:04:07,514 --> 01:04:09,891
Robert McCabe called me himself.

679
01:04:10,308 --> 01:04:12,894
I told him, in one month's time...

680
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:18,233
...I would have the identities of every
person who poisoned his company.

681
01:04:19,442 --> 01:04:20,819
We'll send you back in.

682
01:04:21,236 --> 01:04:22,612
Why not just raid the house?

683
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:25,323
Have you been smoking pot with them?

684
01:04:25,615 --> 01:04:27,409
They don't smoke pot.

685
01:04:27,992 --> 01:04:32,205
We're not some blue-collar security firm. I
didn't send you there to find the location.

686
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:34,082
I have GPS for that.

687
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:37,585
We spend 99% of our time
pitching clients we never sign.

688
01:04:37,669 --> 01:04:41,506
I want to know what the next two jams are,
avert those disasters...

689
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:44,676
...come out looking like a leader
in the intelligence community...

690
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:46,011
...with two new clients.

691
01:04:46,302 --> 01:04:48,680
Then you can lock them up till middle age.

692
01:04:51,307 --> 01:04:53,518
What are we not talking about?

693
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:06,197
Getting attached to them is all right.
It's human.

694
01:05:06,781 --> 01:05:09,784
We know it happens.
It's the first thing we cover in training.

695
01:05:10,076 --> 01:05:13,872
If you spent every day with
a pack of White supremacists...

696
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:16,374
...you'd develop feelings for them, too.

697
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:23,798
But do not get soft.

698
01:05:26,384 --> 01:05:30,722
If they find out who you are, they won't
give a second thought to your destruction.

699
01:06:11,846 --> 01:06:13,264
Sarah!

700
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:19,479
You dance, don't you? Come on.

701
01:06:26,194 --> 01:06:28,613
Guess you didn't like it better
on the outside.

702
01:06:30,156 --> 01:06:31,658
The jam worked.

703
01:06:35,578 --> 01:06:37,163
Is that why you came back?

704
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:41,626
I came back because
I missed being uncomfortable.

705
01:06:42,168 --> 01:06:43,586
You want to keep going?

706
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:46,840
Yeah.

707
01:07:24,669 --> 01:07:25,670
Sorry.

708
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:27,255
That's okay.

709
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:29,758
You left. I thought you got lost.

710
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:34,137
I couldn't sleep.

711
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:38,725
- Want to go for a ride?
- Yeah.

712
01:08:02,999 --> 01:08:04,751
We can go down there.

713
01:08:05,418 --> 01:08:07,420
You know these woods well.

714
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:10,006
Have you lived here before?

715
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:14,761
Yeah. I was born here.

716
01:08:18,598 --> 01:08:20,433
How did the house burn?

717
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:23,228
I set it on fire.

718
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,443
Where was your family?

719
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:33,822
My parents were already dead.

720
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:41,204
We were out on a night sail...

721
01:08:42,205 --> 01:08:44,624
...Mom, Dad, and my dog, Growl.

722
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:46,710
Your dog's name was Growl?

723
01:08:54,592 --> 01:08:58,596
We hit a submerged shipping container
and the boat capsized.

724
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:05,520
Growl and I ended up beside it,
and Mom and Dad underneath.

725
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:12,736
At first, I could hear them in there...

726
01:09:15,488 --> 01:09:17,699
...and then I couldn't.

727
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:30,295
So when I got back, I had all this money
and this huge house and everything.

728
01:09:32,672 --> 01:09:35,675
And people had changed.
They treated me differently.

729
01:09:36,676 --> 01:09:40,013
Everyone. My friends,
my uncles, my grandparents.

730
01:09:42,682 --> 01:09:44,517
But what scared me...

731
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:48,313
...was the fact that I let them.

732
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:52,317
That I liked it.

733
01:09:54,694 --> 01:09:59,532
I saw how money corrupts everything
and I felt that it started to corrupt me.

734
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:04,412
That's why I set the house on fire.

735
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,293
Things would be easier
if we didn't feel the need to fight.

736
01:10:10,627 --> 01:10:12,420
If we could just let go.

737
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:16,299
Maybe you should.

738
01:10:21,304 --> 01:10:23,431
Just disappear one night.

739
01:10:47,288 --> 01:10:48,415
Can we wash you?

740
01:10:55,296 --> 01:10:57,882
I don't think I'll feel comfortable
unless you say it.

741
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:01,386
Yeah.

742
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:04,597
You all can wash me.

743
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:21,156
Are you okay?

744
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:25,785
I don't think so.

745
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:28,705
Nothing will happen that you don't want.

746
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:30,749
You're in control.

747
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:32,959
Do you want to stop?

748
01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:38,798
No.

749
01:11:40,675 --> 01:11:42,385
I want to keep going.

750
01:12:02,822 --> 01:12:06,826
Okay, we're going to wash you
as fast as we can. Will you help?

751
01:12:07,827 --> 01:12:10,622
Sweetie! Sweetie, please! Hey!

752
01:12:11,664 --> 01:12:14,250
Set a good example for your brother.
Stop it.

753
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:17,253
I have an idea.

754
01:12:17,587 --> 01:12:19,964
You do my head and I'll do my body,
then it's faster.

755
01:12:20,256 --> 01:12:21,633
Why is she timing them?

756
01:12:22,175 --> 01:12:24,594
Because the water's filled with
arsenic and lead.

757
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:26,638
It's Ambler, Pennsylvania.

758
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:29,974
The whole town's downstream
from a Hawkstone mine.

759
01:12:30,266 --> 01:12:32,852
They've pumped waste
into that ground for years.

760
01:12:33,269 --> 01:12:34,771
Just like Sago, where I grew up.

761
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:38,650
Get in bed and I'll read you a story.
Pick one out.

762
01:12:39,067 --> 01:12:41,277
We put the house on the market...

763
01:12:41,569 --> 01:12:45,740
...once we found out the water was eating
away at the enamel in Taylor's teeth, but...

764
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:50,662
...unfortunately, no one wants to buy
a house in a town with poisoned water.

765
01:12:50,745 --> 01:12:54,249
My husband's work gets
a great deal on bottled water.

766
01:12:54,582 --> 01:12:57,460
We use it to brush our teeth.
We're really lucky.

767
01:12:57,794 --> 01:12:59,671
The little one died three months ago.

768
01:13:00,338 --> 01:13:01,923
Brain tumors.

769
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:07,929
Okay, I think that's enough.

770
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:12,350
Okay, do we agree on the plan?

771
01:13:12,684 --> 01:13:13,852
An eye for an eye.

772
01:13:14,352 --> 01:13:16,146
Can't be more. Can't be less.

773
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:19,482
So, technically, we could kill them
and be in your moral clear.

774
01:13:19,774 --> 01:13:21,276
That's not funny.

775
01:13:21,568 --> 01:13:24,154
How we perform a jam
is as important as its outcome.

776
01:13:24,446 --> 01:13:28,241
What outcome? Nobody cares about
that freaky Paige Williams anymore.

777
01:13:28,533 --> 01:13:30,910
The McCabe-Grey jam
worked like gangbusters.

778
01:13:31,327 --> 01:13:33,121
True, but it's blown over now.

779
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:38,126
People don't respond to your intellectual
bullshit. They respond to firepower.

780
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:41,921
It's like 9/11. That's why I was in Iraq.
You got to get people mad.

781
01:13:42,255 --> 01:13:45,050
Okay, just wait.
What are the real risks here?

782
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:50,263
Twenty-five years for kidnapping,
if they can prove intent to bodily harm.

783
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:52,724
Sarah...

784
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:54,934
...what do you think?

785
01:13:56,770 --> 01:14:00,607
I think hurting people
isn't going to bring that little boy back.

786
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:05,153
Paige is going to have seizures like Doc.

787
01:14:05,403 --> 01:14:07,781
We saved tens of thousands of
people from that fate.

788
01:14:08,114 --> 01:14:11,409
But if we hurt people,
aren't we just as bad as they are?

789
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:14,996
Then why are you here?

790
01:14:15,413 --> 01:14:17,582
What, I have to agree? Are we fascists?

791
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:18,917
Of course not.

792
01:14:19,209 --> 01:14:23,338
You told me five years ago,
individuals had to be held accountable.

793
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:27,217
I joined this group for this jam.

794
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:28,718
This is my jam.

795
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:32,013
It's our jam! We work together.

796
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:34,224
Don't forget that.

797
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:43,525
Hi. I'm Diane Wisecarver,
senior-level management at Hawkstone.

798
01:14:43,608 --> 01:14:47,612
You'll notice behind me here,
an array of large machinery...

799
01:14:47,904 --> 01:14:50,699
...but rest assured, it
is state of the art...

800
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:53,702
...up to the latest environmental
codes and standards.

801
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:58,123
This beautiful lake is a natural wildlife
preserve. It's tested twice a year.

802
01:14:58,415 --> 01:15:01,418
We have an abundance of
wildlife that visits.

803
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:05,088
And we've had all nearby creeks tested
by three independent agencies.

804
01:15:05,422 --> 01:15:07,590
There is nothing wrong with
the water in Ambler.

805
01:16:06,107 --> 01:16:07,525
Katie.

806
01:16:07,942 --> 01:16:09,361
Hello, Dad.

807
01:16:11,571 --> 01:16:13,073
What are you doing here?

808
01:16:13,865 --> 01:16:15,575
I set this up.

809
01:16:20,372 --> 01:16:21,873
You're so different.

810
01:16:25,085 --> 01:16:26,503
Beautiful.

811
01:16:28,088 --> 01:16:29,673
Not that you haven't always been beautiful.

812
01:16:29,756 --> 01:16:31,091
More beautiful in a dress.

813
01:16:33,677 --> 01:16:35,095
You're a woman.

814
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:38,598
All grown up.

815
01:16:41,518 --> 01:16:42,977
Where have you been?

816
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:45,605
Around.

817
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:48,191
Traveling.

818
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:51,569
Have you seen your mother?
Does she know you're back?

819
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:52,737
I'm not back.

820
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:57,367
And since when
do you care about my mother?

821
01:17:07,585 --> 01:17:09,754
Looks like you stopped
running with those freaks.

822
01:17:12,257 --> 01:17:13,675
Are you okay?

823
01:17:14,467 --> 01:17:15,844
Are you short on funds?

824
01:17:17,262 --> 01:17:19,264
I don't need anything from you.

825
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:24,602
I came to ask you a question.

826
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:28,648
You came all the way to this hotel...

827
01:17:29,649 --> 01:17:31,484
...and my company's summit...

828
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:33,611
...to ask me a question.

829
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:35,363
Shoot.

830
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:40,660
Did you know Johnny Perkins
died from brain tumors?

831
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:42,454
Who the hell is Johnny Perkins?

832
01:17:42,746 --> 01:17:47,375
He died from cancer because the water
in his house was filled with arsenic.

833
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,631
He was four.

834
01:17:56,259 --> 01:17:57,677
And he lived in Ambler.

835
01:18:05,268 --> 01:18:06,269
What is this?

836
01:18:07,145 --> 01:18:09,939
Is this part of some rehab or something?

837
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:16,112
A lot of people have been hurt...
because of what you've done.

838
01:18:18,531 --> 01:18:21,117
I just need to hear you say it out loud.

839
01:18:31,127 --> 01:18:33,546
I'm not playing this game with you.

840
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:56,736
You know how they say two wrongs
don't make a right?

841
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:07,997
I'd say whoever said that
has never been wronged before.

842
01:19:15,755 --> 01:19:16,589
Sit.

843
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:20,719
Help! Someone call an ambulance!

844
01:19:20,802 --> 01:19:22,595
I'm a doctor! I can help!

845
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:53,793
What's wrong with the fish?

846
01:19:54,627 --> 01:19:59,341
Nothing is wrong with the fish. They're
dying because you poisoned the water.

847
01:19:59,632 --> 01:20:01,009
This has gone on far enough.

848
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:02,594
We've had enough of this.

849
01:20:03,428 --> 01:20:04,596
It's 2:58.

850
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:07,724
Almost time to get in.

851
01:20:11,561 --> 01:20:12,729
I don't understand.

852
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:14,773
It's pretty simple, really.

853
01:20:15,023 --> 01:20:20,028
You make your living by poisoning
this creek and other rivers and lakes.

854
01:20:20,403 --> 01:20:24,616
You separate yourselves
in gated communities with golf courses...

855
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:26,201
...from the world you're destroying.

856
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:30,580
From the families who cannot afford
to move away from this creek.

857
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:34,584
Or from the cancer their children
are dying of.

858
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:38,213
You create for a living...

859
01:20:39,005 --> 01:20:43,426
...toxic chemicals that will
outlive us all and feel nothing.

860
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:46,805
But tonight, you will feel something.

861
01:20:49,224 --> 01:20:50,350
Strip.

862
01:20:50,642 --> 01:20:53,728
Be reasonable.
You're threatening our lives.

863
01:20:53,812 --> 01:20:57,732
You're the CEO of this company.
How many lives are you threatening?

864
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:04,698
- We can't go in there right now.
- Why?

865
01:21:05,657 --> 01:21:07,784
Why can't you go in there?
What happens at three?

866
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:14,082
Take off your clothes or
I will do it for you.

867
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:18,878
We could pay you.
We could pay you to have it cleaned up.

868
01:21:19,295 --> 01:21:21,881
- Just tell her the truth.
- Shut up, Sarah.

869
01:21:25,593 --> 01:21:26,803
Time to get in.

870
01:21:29,514 --> 01:21:31,016
We can pay you!

871
01:21:31,641 --> 01:21:33,309
That's enough! Izzy!

872
01:21:33,893 --> 01:21:35,311
Sarah, back off!

873
01:21:38,064 --> 01:21:40,483
- I didn't know!
- You did!

874
01:21:40,567 --> 01:21:44,404
You did know!
It's just easier to pretend you didn't!

875
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:49,200
Get in the water!

876
01:21:49,492 --> 01:21:52,662
All right, okay, yes!
Yes, we treat the coal!

877
01:21:52,996 --> 01:21:56,207
We treat the coal because
it burns more efficiently!

878
01:21:56,708 --> 01:22:01,171
Yes, we do! And we dump the slurry in the
river because it has to go someplace!

879
01:22:01,588 --> 01:22:03,590
People need power for their homes!

880
01:22:05,759 --> 01:22:06,968
Get in the water!

881
01:22:07,302 --> 01:22:10,096
She said it! We made our point!
We made our point!

882
01:22:20,732 --> 01:22:22,400
God help me.

883
01:22:23,985 --> 01:22:26,404
I don't know how it got this far.

884
01:22:29,407 --> 01:22:30,992
I'm sorry, Katie.

885
01:22:32,202 --> 01:22:33,620
I'm so...

886
01:22:33,995 --> 01:22:35,413
...sorry.

887
01:22:43,922 --> 01:22:45,340
- Pigs!
- Let's go!

888
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,591
Dad?

889
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:48,718
Dad?

890
01:22:48,802 --> 01:22:50,136
Izzy, we have to go!

891
01:22:50,804 --> 01:22:52,222
Get off!

892
01:22:58,019 --> 01:22:59,437
Let me go!

893
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:00,814
Freeze!

894
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:03,191
- Get on the bike!
- Let me go!

895
01:23:03,483 --> 01:23:04,693
Get on the bike!

896
01:23:17,872 --> 01:23:19,290
Okay, we're here.

897
01:23:21,084 --> 01:23:22,502
Izzy, we're here.

898
01:23:24,087 --> 01:23:25,296
Izzy?

899
01:23:26,089 --> 01:23:28,508
Doc! Doc! Clear the table.

900
01:23:30,218 --> 01:23:32,220
Somebody get Doc! Clear the table!

901
01:23:38,643 --> 01:23:40,812
- She's been shot.
- Where's the wound?

902
01:23:41,229 --> 01:23:42,564
In the back.

903
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:44,482
- We need a light.
- I'll get it.

904
01:23:44,566 --> 01:23:49,195
I need a BMV mask. The one I showed you.
It's in my room. And I need alcohol.

905
01:23:49,487 --> 01:23:51,072
And salt! Get salt.

906
01:23:53,867 --> 01:23:57,704
I need to cut her dress away.
Can we flip her?

907
01:23:59,414 --> 01:24:00,707
Easy.

908
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:04,878
Okay, roll her back.

909
01:24:05,962 --> 01:24:08,173
I need to get to her abdomen.

910
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:10,383
Cut that cloth away.

911
01:24:15,096 --> 01:24:16,514
I want you to breathe.

912
01:24:16,806 --> 01:24:17,974
Just breathe.

913
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:24,606
Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

914
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:30,945
When she's out, I want you to put the mask
over her face. Regular breaths.

915
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:32,947
- She's out.
- You got it.

916
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:35,367
Squeeze it. Full compression.

917
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:51,966
Guys, he needs to focus. Get out.

918
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:56,388
You okay?

919
01:25:02,185 --> 01:25:03,603
Give it to me.

920
01:25:03,978 --> 01:25:05,271
Give it to me.

921
01:25:05,605 --> 01:25:06,815
Tell me what to do.

922
01:25:07,941 --> 01:25:09,359
Give it to her.

923
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:12,821
Come here. Put it over your arms.

924
01:25:15,615 --> 01:25:17,659
Okay, scalpel.

925
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:22,622
You need to make an incision
a quarter-inch deep...

926
01:25:22,956 --> 01:25:25,625
...and two and a half inches across.

927
01:25:25,959 --> 01:25:27,669
- Starting here?
- Yeah.

928
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:32,549
Good. Okay.

929
01:25:32,632 --> 01:25:36,970
You'll have to go through the muscle
tissue, so you have to go deeper.

930
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:38,638
Go along the same line.

931
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:41,266
Okay, just clamp that.

932
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:44,477
Push it deeper. Now close it.

933
01:25:44,811 --> 01:25:46,479
Okay, just lay that down.

934
01:25:46,771 --> 01:25:49,607
You're going to need to
make your hand flat and push it...

935
01:25:49,941 --> 01:25:53,028
...through the abdomen
into the large intestine.

936
01:25:53,361 --> 01:25:56,781
You need to feel around
in there and find the bullet.

937
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:39,532
Oh, my God, you got it.

938
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:44,746
Thank you. We have to sew that up.

939
01:29:24,781 --> 01:29:26,574
Why did you come here?

940
01:29:40,755 --> 01:29:43,383
Sometimes people die before they're ready.

941
01:29:44,175 --> 01:29:45,885
Perfect relationships end in ruin.

942
01:29:46,594 --> 01:29:48,763
Adventures peter out.

943
01:29:52,183 --> 01:29:54,728
Izzy always said she wasn't scared.

944
01:29:56,563 --> 01:29:58,273
She was scared shitless.

945
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:01,943
But she didn't flee.

946
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:05,780
That's what made her braver than me.

947
01:30:49,574 --> 01:30:50,784
Benji!

948
01:30:51,743 --> 01:30:53,787
Stop it! Stop it!

949
01:30:55,372 --> 01:30:56,373
Benji!

950
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:02,253
Where are you going to go?

951
01:31:06,966 --> 01:31:11,388
What did you expect, that it would be easy?
That it would be painless?

952
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:12,764
No.

953
01:31:12,847 --> 01:31:14,808
A revolution is never easy.

954
01:31:16,017 --> 01:31:17,936
But that doesn't make it
any less important.

955
01:31:18,019 --> 01:31:20,605
You can't just walk away from it.

956
01:31:21,022 --> 01:31:22,440
Yes, I can!

957
01:31:24,609 --> 01:31:27,445
I would trade the revolution
for Izzy any day.

958
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:30,448
That's it.

959
01:31:30,949 --> 01:31:32,826
That's the difference between you and me.

960
01:32:01,312 --> 01:32:02,897
That was a Hawkstone jam.

961
01:32:03,314 --> 01:32:05,108
It obviously has not been released.

962
01:32:06,317 --> 01:32:10,905
The group has unraveled
without executing their last jam.

963
01:32:18,747 --> 01:32:20,623
Her name was Kate Cannon.

964
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:25,712
Her cover identity was Isabella Duncan.
They called her Izzy.

965
01:32:28,757 --> 01:32:31,718
She dropped out of Brown her junior year...

966
01:32:32,135 --> 01:32:34,554
...when she met William.

967
01:32:56,451 --> 01:32:59,662
I'm subletting a basement apartment
in Georgetown.

968
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:04,793
I don't want to lie to you.

969
01:33:06,586 --> 01:33:11,216
You can still spend Christmas with
my family. You're still family.

970
01:33:13,218 --> 01:33:17,806
But it's just been a long time since
I knew what you were thinking.

971
01:33:23,603 --> 01:33:25,397
I haven't been to Dubai.

972
01:33:26,773 --> 01:33:29,776
I've been in an anarchist collective
not that far from here.

973
01:33:37,117 --> 01:33:39,703
Why does someone do a job like this?

974
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:58,490
<i>It looks like they're regrouping.
You have to go back.</i>

975
01:34:58,573 --> 01:35:02,243
<i>Sharon wants more intel.
The FBI's looking to make arrests.</i>

976
01:35:49,749 --> 01:35:51,167
Come sit.

977
01:35:56,172 --> 01:35:59,175
I'm a pretty terrible cook,
I should warn you.

978
01:36:07,225 --> 01:36:10,437
Remember when I said
you could just disappear?

979
01:36:16,818 --> 01:36:18,611
I think it's time.

980
01:36:19,654 --> 01:36:23,450
Izzy's dad was all over the news.
I think me and you...

981
01:36:25,035 --> 01:36:28,830
I mean, Doc, everyone.
I think we should go.

982
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:34,627
- I think we have to leave this place.
- No. We can't do that.

983
01:36:35,253 --> 01:36:36,463
Why?

984
01:36:41,384 --> 01:36:43,178
I have something planned for us.

985
01:36:43,845 --> 01:36:45,055
A jam?

986
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:53,646
Could you just forget that for a moment?
For a month?

987
01:36:57,442 --> 01:36:58,610
Leave with me.

988
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,739
This is going to be our last jam here.

989
01:37:03,531 --> 01:37:04,699
Then we'll take off.

990
01:37:05,325 --> 01:37:07,535
But this has to happen now.

991
01:37:10,830 --> 01:37:11,831
I need you.

992
01:37:17,128 --> 01:37:19,714
I took a bullet out of Izzy's stomach.

993
01:37:20,924 --> 01:37:23,343
She's in a hole in the ground.

994
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:27,347
I don't want to keep going like this.
I can't.

995
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:29,099
No one will get hurt this time.

996
01:37:29,724 --> 01:37:31,434
You can't promise me that.

997
01:37:33,728 --> 01:37:34,688
Okay.

998
01:37:36,106 --> 01:37:38,024
But I'll do this, with or without you.

999
01:37:56,918 --> 01:37:58,545
What's the jam?

1000
01:38:01,798 --> 01:38:04,592
- I won't go in there blind.
- You don't have to.

1001
01:38:06,428 --> 01:38:07,721
I'll take you there.

1002
01:38:09,681 --> 01:38:10,682
<i>Tonight.</i>

1003
01:38:50,055 --> 01:38:51,473
Are we almost there?

1004
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:54,476
Yep.

1005
01:38:56,061 --> 01:38:58,188
So you can tell me where we're going.

1006
01:39:01,483 --> 01:39:02,650
I think you know.

1007
01:39:23,505 --> 01:39:24,673
Since when?

1008
01:39:25,507 --> 01:39:28,385
The early companies
we jammed were clients of Hiller Brood.

1009
01:39:31,721 --> 01:39:34,349
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

1010
01:39:35,141 --> 01:39:36,768
Did everyone know?

1011
01:39:38,353 --> 01:39:39,354
No.

1012
01:39:40,647 --> 01:39:42,065
Just me and Luca.

1013
01:39:48,738 --> 01:39:49,739
What do you want?

1014
01:39:50,156 --> 01:39:53,702
A list of every Hiller Brood operative
all over the world.

1015
01:39:54,953 --> 01:39:56,579
Their identities...

1016
01:39:56,955 --> 01:39:58,748
...locations, assignments.

1017
01:39:59,165 --> 01:40:00,750
You're going to recruit them.

1018
01:40:01,084 --> 01:40:03,169
No. I'm going to watch them.

1019
01:40:04,379 --> 01:40:06,965
Spy on us and we'll spy on you.

1020
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:13,722
To even get into the building,
you need clearance.

1021
01:40:23,148 --> 01:40:26,651
What makes you so certain
I'll get you that list?

1022
01:40:26,735 --> 01:40:28,153
I'm not.

1023
01:40:29,738 --> 01:40:31,781
I'm not certain of anything.

1024
01:40:33,658 --> 01:40:35,076
I'm going to wait.

1025
01:40:35,785 --> 01:40:36,745
Here.

1026
01:40:38,788 --> 01:40:40,582
For whatever you decide to do.

1027
01:41:27,504 --> 01:41:28,505
Pigs!

1028
01:41:37,806 --> 01:41:39,724
I need to see Sharon.

1029
01:41:39,808 --> 01:41:41,935
She's in video conference upstairs.

1030
01:41:42,435 --> 01:41:44,646
It's urgent. Please let her know I'm here.

1031
01:42:28,732 --> 01:42:32,902
It's urgent as in "Will you go upstairs
and get her?" Right now.

1032
01:43:22,786 --> 01:43:25,914
What is so important
it couldn't wait fifteen minutes?

1033
01:43:27,749 --> 01:43:28,917
The final jam.

1034
01:43:31,211 --> 01:43:32,921
It's Lyra.

1035
01:43:34,631 --> 01:43:36,633
They're going to hack the satellite.

1036
01:43:36,925 --> 01:43:41,721
Turn all the cameras in the sky against
the CEO, the CFO, the COO. Spy on them.

1037
01:43:41,971 --> 01:43:44,391
- They can do that?
- Yeah.

1038
01:43:45,392 --> 01:43:48,520
- And broadcast it online.
- That's clever.

1039
01:43:49,771 --> 01:43:51,314
I'm glad you're back.

1040
01:43:51,981 --> 01:43:53,191
Safe.

1041
01:43:53,983 --> 01:43:57,570
Oh, the Bureau raided
The East house today.

1042
01:43:58,405 --> 01:44:00,281
I thought you'd want to know.

1043
01:44:02,075 --> 01:44:04,577
Another cell will probably pick up the jam.

1044
01:44:05,078 --> 01:44:09,082
I was sharing some of your report
with the Bureau...

1045
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:12,544
...and they reminded me of something
I wondered about.

1046
01:44:12,627 --> 01:44:14,087
Why all the dumpster diving?

1047
01:44:14,504 --> 01:44:17,173
Why not just grow your own food?

1048
01:44:17,257 --> 01:44:19,300
He's got money.
Why not buy an organic farm?

1049
01:44:19,634 --> 01:44:21,678
They eat garbage on principle.

1050
01:44:22,679 --> 01:44:24,848
It's not rotten food.

1051
01:44:26,057 --> 01:44:30,478
It's good food that has to be
thrown away legally.

1052
01:44:31,855 --> 01:44:33,690
The system is broken.

1053
01:44:34,482 --> 01:44:37,068
And the evidence is the trash.

1054
01:44:45,076 --> 01:44:46,661
It has value.

1055
01:44:52,709 --> 01:44:56,296
I know... I've been eating
three square meals a day from it.

1056
01:45:14,647 --> 01:45:16,858
Step aside for additional screening.

1057
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:19,486
I'm grabbing something
for Sharon from her car.

1058
01:45:19,778 --> 01:45:21,571
Please spread your arms and legs.

1059
01:45:21,946 --> 01:45:23,156
Greg?

1060
01:45:54,729 --> 01:45:57,774
We'll send your BlackBerry upstairs
when we're done.

1061
01:46:00,151 --> 01:46:01,569
Thank you.

1062
01:46:11,621 --> 01:46:12,831
Wait!

1063
01:46:26,803 --> 01:46:28,430
They raided the house.

1064
01:46:31,433 --> 01:46:32,434
Did you get it?

1065
01:46:32,809 --> 01:46:35,437
The FBI raided The East house.

1066
01:46:37,230 --> 01:46:39,232
Doc is probably on his way to jail.

1067
01:46:39,566 --> 01:46:42,235
Not in vain if you wipe out
the agents on that list.

1068
01:46:44,362 --> 01:46:45,947
Did you get it?

1069
01:46:47,657 --> 01:46:48,616
No, I didn't.

1070
01:46:52,245 --> 01:46:53,830
They took my BlackBerry.

1071
01:46:58,251 --> 01:47:02,130
I know a lot of the people on that list.
We could go to them.

1072
01:47:02,922 --> 01:47:06,051
If some of them saw
the things that I've seen...

1073
01:47:06,634 --> 01:47:08,219
...they would turn.

1074
01:47:08,553 --> 01:47:09,512
They would turn.

1075
01:47:09,596 --> 01:47:11,598
Sarah, this was supposed to be a jam.

1076
01:47:12,682 --> 01:47:17,437
We'd destroy Hiller Brood by posting
their agents' real identities online.

1077
01:47:18,313 --> 01:47:22,650
Those people work undercover. You can't
expose them. You could get them killed.

1078
01:47:31,242 --> 01:47:34,120
You told me you wanted to watch them.

1079
01:47:34,746 --> 01:47:37,123
I want them to feel the consequences
of their actions.

1080
01:47:38,708 --> 01:47:40,710
Then you should start with me.

1081
01:47:47,217 --> 01:47:48,802
I'm on that list, too.

1082
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,889
You're burned there.

1083
01:47:53,682 --> 01:47:55,725
They'll be coming after us.

1084
01:47:56,101 --> 01:47:58,103
We have to get across the border.

1085
01:48:25,922 --> 01:48:27,340
I can't get on the truck.

1086
01:48:28,550 --> 01:48:30,677
We have to go. It's not safe for you here.

1087
01:48:30,969 --> 01:48:32,762
I can't go.

1088
01:48:35,974 --> 01:48:37,392
Can't or won't?

1089
01:48:41,563 --> 01:48:42,981
I won't.

1090
01:48:53,408 --> 01:48:54,617
Jane.

1091
01:48:58,788 --> 01:49:00,498
Come with me.

1092
01:49:12,052 --> 01:49:14,054
We don't have that list.

1093
01:49:14,846 --> 01:49:16,639
But if we did...

1094
01:49:20,643 --> 01:49:24,272
...I think that you and I would want to do
different things with it.

1095
01:50:41,057 --> 01:50:43,643
<i>Please give me the strength to do well.</i>

1096
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:45,854
<i>To not be arrogant.</i>

1097
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:50,066
<i>But to not be weak.</i>

1098
01:50:52,652 --> 01:50:53,102
<i>Amen.</i>
