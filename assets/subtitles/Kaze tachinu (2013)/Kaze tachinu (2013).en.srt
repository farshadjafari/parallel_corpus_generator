3
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,732
Jiro, here it is.

4
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,948
Would it be alright if I borrow it?

5
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,784
- It's not Japanese.
- That's okay. I have a dictionary.

6
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,453
- Alright then, give it a try.
- Thank you.

7
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,141
- Knock it off.
- Stay out of it, Jiro!

8
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,809
Go home! Now!

9
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,644
Jiro...

10
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,272
He's half your size, Katayama.

11
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,458
Ah...you look quite the hero.

12
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,836
No, I just slipped and fell.

13
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,339
- Fighting is never justified.
- Yes, mother.

14
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,593
Alright. now you can go have your snack.

15
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,344
Thanks.

16
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,515
Jiro, you're home!

17
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:21,979
- Welcome home.
- Oh, Jiro , now we can pick some bamboo grass.

18
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,982
Jiro!

19
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,529
Wait, where are you going?

20
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,703
You promised to pick bamboo grass today.

21
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,079
I got homework.

22
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,296
What kind of homework is that?

23
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,839
It's an English magazine.

24
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,844
Oh, look at that stupid moustache.

25
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,889
He's a very famous Italian
aircraft designer.

26
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,727
His name is Caproni.
Wow, it says he's a count.

27
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,022
- What happened? Your face is scratched.
- Leave it alone, Kayo!

28
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,858
You should put iodine on it. I'll do it for you.

29
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:09,502
Would you cut it out!

30
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,082
What are you doing up here?

31
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,917
You're not suppose to be up here.

32
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,585
Where are your glasses?

33
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:30,090
I heard you can fix your eyesight
by focusing very intently on the stars.

34
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,761
- Mom will be mad if you're not in your bed.
- I see a shooting star!

35
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,847
Oh, there's another one.

36
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,435
Ah, they're pretty.
Oh, look at that one!

37
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,939
Wow, there's so many of them.

38
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,145
I'm a Japanese boy.

39
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,445
I'm dreaming. I think this is my dream.

40
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,505
This is my dream, you know.

41
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,424
I think it's mine too.

42
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,009
Your dream?

43
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:00,680
Listen, Japanese boy. So you think
we are sharing this dream?

44
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,015
I hope so.

45
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,519
You're Count Caproni, aren't you?
I've been reading all about you.

46
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:12,192
Interesting. Yes, this is a dream.
This world is a dream.

47
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,194
Welcome to my kingdom.

48
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,862
I'm honored.

49
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,865
Look at them.

50
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:28,124
They will bomb an enemy city.
Most of them will never return.

51
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,384
Well, it'll all be over very soon.

52
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,228
Come on up, Japanese boy.

53
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,943
This is my true dream. When the war is over, I'll build this.

54
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,363
What do you think? Magnificent, isn't she?

55
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,907
Let's take off.

56
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,664
Instead of bombs,
she'll carry passengers.

57
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,592
I find dreams are a good way 

58
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,762
to see my designs.
I can go anywhere.

59
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,982
Come on, walk along the spar, Japanese boy.

60
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,280
Look at that.

61
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:19,319
- She's beautiful, yes?
- Yes, incredible.

62
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,577
She'll carry a hundred people
across the Atlantic.

63
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,831
Mr. Caproni,
may I ask you a question?

64
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,336
I know I can't be a pilot because of my eyesight.

65
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,841
If I'm not a pilot, can I still design airplanes?

66
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,512
Japanese boy,

67
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:50,015
I've been around planes all my life. You know how many I've flown? None! Not any one!

68
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,019
Many can fly a plane but I design them.

69
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,774
I create airplanes and so can you.
An aeronautical engineer!

70
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,317
Yes!

71
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,694
But remember this, Japanese boy.

72
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:06,199
Airplanes are not tools for war.
They are not for making money.

73
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,868
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

74
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,163
Engineers turn dreams into reality.

75
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,665
Yes!

76
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,793
Arrivederci. We'll meet again.

77
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:34,060
Jiro, you were talking in your sleep.

78
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,899
You were smiling. You must be having the most wonderful dream, Jiro.

79
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,403
Mother, I'm going to be
an aeronautical engineer.

80
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,406
Oh, that does sound like a good dream.

81
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:50,159
(sigh) He told me that airplanes are beautiful dreams. 

82
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,704
So I'm going to make beautiful airplanes.

83
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,068
Excuse me Miss, please,
take my seat.

84
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,278
Pardon me, sir.

85
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,529
I insist.

86
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,817
(French) The wind feels wonderful.

87
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,737
Miss, you'll lose your hat.

88
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,988
I got it.

89
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,998
- Miss! Miss!
- Hold on!

90
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,336
Are you all right?

91
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,129
Safe!

92
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,964
Nice catch.

93
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,050
You speak French?

94
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,344
"Le vent se lève."
It's a French poem.

95
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,181
"Il faut tenter de vivre."

96
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,334
"Le vent se lève.
Il faut tenter de vivre."

97
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,714
"The wind is rising.
We must try to live."

98
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,226
Earthquake.

99
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,489
Get away! The boiler's going to blow!

100
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,459
- What's wrong?
- Her leg.

101
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,794
Here, let me see.

102
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,130
Ah...

103
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,590
Be brave, Kinu.

104
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,385
It's broken.
She won't be able to walk.

105
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,638
Miss, the boiler.
Please save yourself, go!

106
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,306
That's nonsense.

107
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,977
Nothing's going to explode.

108
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,480
We need to brace her leg.

109
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,197
This will hurt a little, relax.

110
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,997
She can't walk on this.
Where do you live?

111
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,666
- In Ueno.
- Don't worry, I'll get you there.

112
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,347
- Fire.
- Let's go.

113
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,449
- What about your luggage?
- It's not important.

114
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,390
I'm so sorry.

115
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,892
- You alright?
- Okay.

116
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,445
Better hurry.

117
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,617
Here, my mother made me this shirt. You must be thirsty.

118
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,285
Don't worry, it's clean.

119
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,251
The well's almost dry...
and for you?

120
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,502
Please.

121
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,635
The fire hasn't reached Ueno and 

122
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,346
I'm heading for the university. So, I can take you there.

123
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,515
And help bring someone, from my house.

124
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,851
Then we should get going, now.

125
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,812
- Kinu, look after my suitcase. 
- Okay.

126
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,231
We'll bring someone to get you home. I promise.

127
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,608
- Stay strong.
- Okay. I will.

128
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,776
- Thank you very much for helping us.
- Take care of her.

129
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,778
But wait, at least tell us your name.

130
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,119
What a great guy.
Who was he, Kinu?

131
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,764
Well, it isn't Jiro. You picked a lovely day to come back.

132
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,474
How bad is it, Honjo?

133
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,144
Bad enough.
The whole east side is burning.

134
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,565
We grabbed everything we could carry out of the library.

135
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,108
Got a smoke?

136
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,617
A flying door? Don't see that everyday.
We'll never gonna stop the fire now.

137
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,452
Tokyo's finished.

138
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:54,971
It's as beautiful as it was in the dream. I can't really believe he built it.

139
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,575
Cut! Cut! Cut!

140
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,378
Damn wind's picking up.
We need to hurry.

141
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,343
What do you think, Japanese boy?
Is the wind still rising?

142
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,388
Yes, it's a gale.

143
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,517
Well then, you must live.
"Le vent se lève."

144
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,061
"II faut tenter de vivre."

145
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,456
Jiro, let's eat.

146
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,211
Look, even the new buildings
are old-fashioned.

147
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,464
If the streets are a little wider.

148
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,841
So? The airplanes are still old.

149
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,470
Welcome!

150
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,018
Oh look, Mackerel again?

151
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,644
Yeah, it's always good.

152
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,647
Always. Always the same lunch, always the same Mackerel.

153
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,716
- Kina, can you help me?
- Coming up!

154
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,153
Meanwhile, other countries are building metal planes.

155
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,781
We're 10 years behind

156
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:02,384
and you're still stuck with Mackerel.

157
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,161
What is that?

158
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,704
Beautiful, isn't it?

159
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,665
Look at that wonderful curve.

160
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,710
Only you would get a thrill from fish bones.

161
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,339
Come on, finish up.
I need a coffee.

162
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,520
What on earth is Jiro working so hard on?

163
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,355
Fish bones.

164
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,066
Is Mr. Horikoshi back from lunch?

165
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,234
Jiro!

166
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,653
Honjo, listen to this.

167
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:42,032
The NACA has a standard wingcross section just like the curve of this fish bone.

168
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,867
Maybe the Americans eat mackerel too.

169
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,161
Jiro, you got a visitor.

170
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,999
- Yes?
- A young lady came by and brought this package for you, Mr. Horikoshi.

171
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,419
You were out,
so she left it with me.

172
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,046
I see. Thank you very much.

173
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,217
Ah, is that a present from your girlfriend, Jiro?

174
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,220
Can it, freshman, and give me a smoke.

175
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,655
- Jiro!
- Let him go.

176
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,474
- Oh, Mr. Horikoshi.
- Yes, Mam?

177
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:52,769
You've a guest waiting for you upstairs. It's a young lady.

178
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,605
Huh, young lady?

179
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,657
- Hello?
- Finally, where were you?

180
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,160
Kayo, I'm sorry.

181
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,412
Completely forgot.

182
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,788
I'm not surprise!

183
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,500
- Where's mother?
- At uncle's.

184
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,169
- Is she staying there?
- Just for a night.

185
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:21,924
Kayo, you've gotten so tall 
and very pretty too.

186
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:27,428
You're so insensitive. I'm still mad at you 'cause you never come home!

187
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,768
Oh, the sun is already down.
I'm going to be late.

188
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:37,314
I'll tell them it's my fault. Don't worry. We'll take the penny steamer.

189
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,027
I think she must really like you.

190
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,821
I don't know, it's been over two years.

191
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,658
Didn't you ever try to see her again?

192
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,369
I did. I went back after the fire was out.

193
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,175
- Her house has burnt down.
- That's terrible.

194
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,760
Here, let's catch this one.

195
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,191
Are you cold, Kayo?

196
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:25,404
I'm fine. I didn't think
Tokyo would recover so quickly.

197
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,369
Jiro, maybe I can stay here with you?

198
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,747
Father won't let me
live here by myself.

199
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,751
Well, I might be at Nagoya
by the time you come.

200
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,920
- With an airplane company?
- I hope so.

201
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,922
Men have it so good.

202
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,676
Why can't I live in Tokyo and go to medical school?

203
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,179
Medical school? You should, I think you make a great doctor.

204
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,181
I think so too.

205
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:56,059
When I'm home for New Years,
I'll talk to father about it.

206
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,562
Oh, thank you.

207
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,962
Hey, Jiro!

208
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,633
- Heavy?
- Yep.

209
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,176
- Glad you made it.
- Me too.

210
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,845
- We are just getting started.
- We certainly are.

211
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,492
Well, they are probably heading for the city to look for work.

212
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,160
There are dozens of of them.

213
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,287
And there will be hundreds more.

214
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:47,045
Ah, looks like we lost another bank. Tough time is coming, Hachi.

215
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,678
- It's awful.
- I'm so sad.

216
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,180
There were rumors.

217
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:02,185
The economy's in the tank.
I hate to break to you Jiro but so is our new employer.

218
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,994
Mitsubishi Internal
Combustion Engine CO.

219
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,666
You know the pressure we are under. We needed you here over a month ago.

220
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,502
But sir, I was told I could start 
anytime in April.

221
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,380
- Then you should've been here in March!
- Yes, sir.

222
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,341
- I got a very important assignment for you.
- Yes, sir.

223
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,387
- It's the design for the
wing strut fitting and by the way, it's already late!
- Yes, sir.

224
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,891
- I need the plan in the shop as soon as possible. Do what you have to do.
- Yes, sir.

225
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,063
Here.

226
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,735
Let's get you ? specification.
Follow me.

227
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,411
This will be your desk.

228
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,915
- It's imported, nobody likes it. Maybe you will.
- Yes, sir.

229
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,292
- Work goes here, hat goes there.
- Yes, sir.

230
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,879
Listen up! This is the new engineer on the Falcon Project.

231
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,883
It's that genius we've been hearing all about.

232
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,218
Name? Genius.

233
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,261
Jiro Horikoshi. I'm very happy to be here.

234.1
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,430
- Get to work.
- Yes, sir.

234.1
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,430
And the rest of you, get back to work!

235
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,487
Jiro, Jiro.

236
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,365
Let's eat.

237
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,121
- Let's go see the assembly floor.
- Could we maybe have lunch first?

238
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:13,877
Maybe Kurokawa simply hates you. Why else would he have you design that strut on your first day.

239
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,253
Two, please.

240
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,049
Excuse me.
Could we ask a slight favor?

241
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,718
Wow, it's really coming along.

242
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,930
Thank you again for making time for us on your break.

243
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:29,059
No problem at all. You young engineers should visit here more often.

244
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,687
Honjo, look, the strut has
already been installed.

245
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,189
I knew it.

246
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:38,234
Kurokawa is obviously just hazing you, unless his fitting is better than yours...

247
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,946
Mr. Kurokawa is always tough
on new employees.

248
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,282
Honjo, come up here
and take a look.

249
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,409
Something is not right.

250
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,709
- What do you think?
- It looks all right to me .

251
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:58,088
No, this isn't good.
It got the same problem with my design.

252
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,965
Then it must be bad. 

253
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,300
Foreman, lunch's over. What's going on?

254
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,927
Quiet! They are working.

255
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,263
I love it! Airplanes are fascinating!

256
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,474
Yea, fascinating but we're late.

257
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,985
Young man.

258
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,157
This is our boss, Mr. Hattori.

259
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,993
This is his first assignment?

260
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,495
Strut fitting for the Falcon Project, sir.

261
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,665
Not what I've expected. What am I looking at here?

262
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,919
Sir, the steel leaf-spring
will ease the stress from the wing.

263
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,006
This wire expands and contracts, absorbing the forces that act on the wing.

264
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:45,343
I have it running thru' the strut and anchoring it on the fuselage.

265
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,180
That means that we would have to entirely re-design the length of the wing!

266
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:52,183
You're right. I'll run the 
calculations tonight, sir.

267
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:56,354
You're wasting your time.
Where's the assignment that I gave to you this morning?

268
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,689
Right here, sir. I finished it.

269
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,197
Well done. What do you think, Kurokawa?

270
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,783
It's perfect.

271
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,162
- Turn in your work
as soon as you're done!
- Yes, sir.

272
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,209
- What a day, I'm heading out.
- Me too.

273
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:21,046
Wild guess, you already finished Kurokawa's homework?

274
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,380
Just about.

275
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,553
What's the oxen for?

276
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,972
Oh, they haul the prototypes
to the field.

277
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:35,560
Takes them 2 days to drag it out there. You believe that? That's how backward we are.

278
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,395
I don't know. I like them.

279
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,003
Here she comes.

280
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,131
Almost here!

281
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,802
Almost here!

282
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,311
Damn it!

283
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,658
- Tell me you got it?
- 13.3 seconds. 146 knots.

284
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,327
Blast. She needs more horse power.

285
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,664
She deserves better.

286
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,667
- Hey, Kurokawa!
- Yes, sir?

287
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,503
A word with the clients.

288
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,213
- Gentlemen?
- Well done.

289
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,176
- Yea, your Falcon is one hell of a plane!
- And I bet Mitsubishi couldn't do it. Now I'm buying drinks!

290
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,030
Power dive.
He's trying to break 200 knots.

291
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,056
- The chute!
- Go get him!

292
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:38,243
Mr. Kurokawa, let's investigate
what happened when the weather clears. It would be easier.

293
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,411
- How's the pilot?
- He's okay.

294
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,746
That's good.

295
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:46,334
Let's go, Mr. Kurokawa.
We'll re-group, for Falcon Two.

296
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,463
Here you'll be straight with me. Do you think the strut fitting failed?

297
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:55,760
No. I think the problem here is much deeper and more complicated than we thought.

298
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,763
I'll never forget what I saw today.

299
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,267
It's like an endless road is
opened up before my eyes.

300
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,770
There won't be a Falcon Two.

301
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,482
The Army has decided
to go with the competing design.

302
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,487
Today was our last shot
to change their minds.

303
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:19,117
We'll have to shift course. We're gonna to design and build the heavy bomber,

304
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,452
with help from the Germans.

305
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:27,458
You're going to Germany to study Junker's design. I recommended you.

306
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,538
- Still open?
- Ah, welcome back.

307
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,999
Your usual?

308
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,002
- Yea, but 2 slices this time.
- Coming up.

309
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,844
Here you go.

310
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,013
Who looks after them?

311
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:27,018
Well, their parents work late.
They wait there every night.

312
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,854
I feel bad closing the place up.

313
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,689
I see. Well, thanks.

314
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,191
See you tomorrow.

315
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,701
Are you hungry?
I've 2 slices of sponge cake.

316
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,704
You can have them.
It's okay, I just bought them.

317
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,718
Go ahead, take it.

318
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,553
Come on!

319
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,071
Jiro?

320
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:26,077
Wake up! I heard they axed the Falcon Project. I need details.

321
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,082
Sponge cake again? How do you stay alive?

322
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,428
What did you expect?

323
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:47,849
Did you think she was just going to smile and say "thank you, sir"

324
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,434
Of course not.

325
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,104
Well, maybe I did.

326
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,776
Well, if you're looking for a mouth to feed, there happen to be 
plenty of other hungry kids in this neighborhood.

327
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:04,991
And their parents are probably hungrier. It's shameful. I bet it's gonna get worse before it gets better.

328
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,119
I don't understand why this country is so poor.

329
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:13,791
Poor Jiro, stuck in his happy dreams. What Japan is paying the Germans,

330
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:18,838
they can feed every single man, woman and child 
a mountain of sponge cake

331
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,967
but if this country wants airplanes, then I'm goona make the most of it.

332
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,802
Really? They're sending you too?

333
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,137
They told me today.

334
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,139
That's great.

335
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,267
The fact is this poor country pays us 

336
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,812
a lot of money to design war planes. Embrace the irony.

337
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:39,317
I'm going to Tokyo 
tomorrow to get married.

338
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,776
Marry?

339
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:45,323
To work hard at the office,
you need a family at home.

340
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:48,158
More irony for you.
Goodnight.

341
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:27,698
These tight-fisted Germans aren't
letting us see any of Dr.Junker's work.

342
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,700
I don't see any oxen.

343
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,036
Jiro, the airstrip's right next to the plant.

344
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,538
Wow, everything's so big.

345
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,480
It's the G-38.
Is this what we're buying?

346
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,900
Yep, to convert to a bomber.

347
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,237
Who's The Army planning
to bomb with this one?

348
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,906
America, probably.
Not that they could.

349
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,578
This is something.

350
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:14,954
It's amazing.

351
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:19,458
Look. Passengers sit in the wings.
It would be a shame to put bombs there.

352
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:24,589
That's the job, pal. This is our chance to get the all-metal technology.

353
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,262
What? They're not letting us in?

354
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,292
Beautiful.

355
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,343
Take your hands off.

356
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,970
You've been slamming doors on our faces all day.

357
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:17,308
You Japanese copy everything.
All these technology belong to Germany.

358
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:21,145
Oh, I get it. So you're afraid we'll actually improve it!

359
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,772
Honjo, let me talk to them.

360
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:27,151
(German) We have a license
to your technology.

361
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,531
Therefore we officiallly have a right to be in this hangar examining these airplanes.

362
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,495
I understand you're just doing your job but please understand I'm just doing mine.

363
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,332
When I saw Dr.Junkers' single engine plane, I had to get a closer look.

364
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,671
I'm not a soldier, simply an engineer admiring a fellow engineer's work.

365
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:51,008
And as soldier, my orders are not to leave you Japanese unattended.

366
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,028
That's Dr. Junkers.

367
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,030
What an engineer.

368
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,369
Dr. Junkers gave you permission to go inside.

369
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,551
So Jiro, what do you think?

370
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,720
There's more vibration
than I expected.

371
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,973
Our bosses are kids in a candy store.

372
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:43,393
- Hey, you two should let the Army reps sit here, okay?
- Yes, sir.

373
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,399
Just one moment, please.

374
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,402
It's fantastic, what a fortress.

375
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,740
Look, you can walk thru' the wing.

376
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,243
It's amazing.

377
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,247
It's like being
inside a power plant.

378
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,422
Guten tag. We've permission to be here from Dr. Junkers.

379
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,716
Would you mind telling us a bit about your station.

380
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,718
Here is the engineer's station.

381
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,762
It's such a marvelous aircraft.

382
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,600
Young man, you can't go any further.

383
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,437
We understand, my friend.

384
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,607
- Are you seeing this?
- It's incredible.

385
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,943
A triumph of
German industrial technology.

386
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:08,479
Junkers let us in, the Germans shut us out! These specs are useless!

387
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,316
Jiro, give me a cigarette.

388
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,819
Jiro!

389
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,155
Give me a smoke.

390
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,491
We're out.

391
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:40,511
It's cold outside
but this room is quite cozy.

392
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,181
You know that Junkers make these radiators too?

393
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:49,353
Funny, they look just like his planes with such strong paralel lines.

394
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,521
Hmm...

395
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:54,859
Okay, I get it. German's technology is so superior that they can put wings on anything and fly it,

396
00:50:55,427 --> 00:51:00,364
- including their damn radiators.
- Jiro, would you just give it a rest, please.

397
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,702
We can't learn anything from these government specs.

398
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,038
They're nothing but a bunch of pretty numbers.

399
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,709
"This technology
belongs to Germany."

400
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,713
Honjô, maybe we don't need their technology afterall.

401
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,549
Wood and canvas
could be just as good as metal.

402
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:23,053
Jiro, we cannot be stuck in the past forever. We're already 20 years behind!

403
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,393
Let's get some air.

404
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,563
My brain is going to explode.

405
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:45,034
It's as if we were a hare chasing a tortoise with a 20-year lead.

406
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:50,372
But in our little story, the hare doesn't sleep.

407
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,042
We can close the gap but how could we beat it?

408
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,378
We're too far behind. 
We'll always be chasing it.

409
00:51:56,404 --> 00:52:01,342
But what other choice do we have?
Keep running and catch up someday?

410
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,220
I wonder if there's a different way to run.

411
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,062
What is it?

412
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,317
Schubert's "Winter Journey".

413
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:27,242
Well, that's perfect for us. Masterpiece of misery memoir.

414
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,936
- What was that?
- Secret Police. We saw them in the hangar.

415
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,496
<i>Jiro?<i>

416
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,500
Jiro, I'm done. The bath is yours.

417
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,673
Dead to the world...

418
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:09,178
because he thinks he's shouldering the future of Japanese aviation.

419
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,683
There's a telegram
from headquarters.

420
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,560
- Come in.
- No need.

421
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:20,856
Some of us will be returning to Japan right away. You're staying here in Germany.

422
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,359
<i>Jiro will continue west
and return to Japan.<i>

423
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,362
- <i>West?<i>
- <i>They want him to see the world.<i>

424
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,031
<i>Alone?<i>

425
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,892
Mr. Caproni.

426
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,186
Is the wind still rising?

427
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,772
Yes sir, it sure is.

428
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:06,568
Then it's a perfect time to embark on my final flight. Join me.

429
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,570
Wait, you're retiring?

430
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,907
It's a pretty big jump.

431
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,412
Come on, jump!

432
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,508
Why are you sitting there? 
Let's go!.

433
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,512
There's a hatch underneath the fuselage.

434
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,430
- Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.

435
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,807
Let him through, girls.

436
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,100
Up here!

437
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,111
- Come in!
- Yeh! Yeh!

438
00:55:56,311 --> 00:56:01,165
These are all my workers and their families. Practically the whole village.

439
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,792
I thought we take a little journey

440
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:07,629
before we deliver this bomber
to the government.

441
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,138
- What do you think?
- Incredible!

442
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,641
It's like a building
out of ancient Rome.

443
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:23,312
This plane is too big
to be used for fighting

444
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,856
but the military has a weakness for big things.

445
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,817
Japan can never build anything

446
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,821
as grand and as beautiful as this.
The country is too poor and backward

447
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,949
Inspiration is more important than scale.

448
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:40,704
Inspiration unlocks the future.
Technology eventually catches up.

449
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,167
That's my family.

450
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:50,172
We Italians are very poor as well.
Too many mouths to feed.

451
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,514
Hey, settle down or
the bottom will fall out.

452
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,516
Come on.

453
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:10,359
Be careful. This may be a dream
but you can still lose your head.

454
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:24,706
Which would you choose, a world
with pyramids or without?

455
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,250
What do you mean?

456
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:31,213
Humanity has always dreamt of flight, but the dream is cursed.

457
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:36,051
My aircrafts are destined to become tools for slaughter and destruction.

458
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,219
I know.

459
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:41,723
But still, I chose a world
with pyramids in it.

460
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,726
Which world will you choose?

461
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:48,230
I just want to create
beautiful airplanes.

462
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,731
Like that?

463
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,416
Very graceful.

464
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:11,878
I have a long way to go.
I don't even have an engine or a cockpit yet.

465
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:25,267
Bravo! A beautiful dream.

466
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,111
This is my last design.

467
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,614
Artists are only creative
for ten years.

468
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,784
We engineers are no different.

469
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:48,123
Live your ten years well, Japanese boy.

470
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,808
Jiro, let's go get some coffee.

471
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,977
- But I gotta go to a...
- Cancel it.

472
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,830
- This is a very tall order.
- They're always tall.

473
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,500
How long have you
been here, Jiro?

474
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,002
Jiro! 

475
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,505
- How long have you been here?
- Five years.

476
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:40,342
Jiro, we're going to bid for the Navy's carrier base fighter.

477
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:44,012
We think we're ready to beat the Navy's chief designer.

478
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,514
It's a plum job.

479
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,060
It's a plum job!

480
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,864
What do you think?

481
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,574
Leave it to me, sir.

482
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,034
Good.

483
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,203
I'd like Honjo on the team, sir.

484
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,579
Not a good idea.

485
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:13,375
You'd just end up competing.
Friendships are always more important.

486
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,877
Relax, finish your coffee.

487
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,380
My check, please. Kurokawa.

488
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,550
We've got other plans for your friend Honjo.

489
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,098
Damn these Japanese engines!

490
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,944
Damn these short runways.

491
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,284
I brought some clean uniforms.

492
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,328
Oh, thank you very much.

493
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,966
These are clean uniforms.

494
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,301
Yes, we are ready.

495
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,163
Man overboard!

496
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,384
Stop!

497
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,947
Whoa!

498
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,783
<i>(cheering on)<i>

499
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,016
Father!

500
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:11,441
Bravo! That was a nice catch.

501
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:18,239
It nearly took you away.
Are you all right?

502
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:19,908
I'm fine.

503
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:23,077
Thank you. I'll make sure that it stays grounded.

504
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,579
Yes, sir.

505
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:41,095
I feel bad. I wanted to say thank you.

506
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:43,431
Nice young man. Don't worry.

507
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:46,643
He's staying at our hotel.
You'll have a chance
to say thank you.

508
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,934
What is it, dear?

509
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:36,938
There's something about that man
who caught the parasol.

510
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:40,108
Oh, he seems to be 
here by himself.

511
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,389
I'm very sorry.

512
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:59,187
Please don't go.
I was giving thanks to the spring.

513
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:03,524
I asked it to bring you here. I asked it to bring you to me.

514
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:11,574
You haven't changed at all from that day years ago. You look just the same.

515
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:16,079
We were so grateful
for your help after the earthquake.

516
01:11:16,271 --> 01:11:19,415
I wanted to see you
again and thank you.

517
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,584
Oh, I remember.

518
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,587
My name is Nahoko Satomi.

519
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,423
I'm Jiro Horikoshi.

520
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,947
This umbrella is useless. Are you alright?

521
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,448
Oh, I'm fine.

522
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:58,788
Kinu searched for you for years. Then she found you just before she got married.

523
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,542
She cried with joy after she dropped off your shirt.

524
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:06,129
You see, you were our knight
in shining armor.

525
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,296
Your knight?

526
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:10,800
You, I think I remember you were on a white horse.

527
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,636
Well, I'm not doing much now to keep you dry.

528
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,304
It's okay.

529
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,306
I don't mind at all.

530
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,810
Kinu will be so excited when I tell her.

531
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,937
I found our hero again.

532
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,651
Oh, your painting is ruined.

533
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,821
No, it's not. I'll always remember this day when I look at it.

534
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,157
Well, look, it's clearing up.

535
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:42,832
It's like another land!

536
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,669
Oh, Jiro, look!

537
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,180
I almost forgot
what rainbows look like.

538
01:12:57,372 --> 01:12:59,682
Life is wonderful, isn't it?

539
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,353
Oh, we should go. My father's probably worried sick.

540
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,193
There he is.

541
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:12,695
Father!

542
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,199
- Come with me. I would really love to introduce you.
- Of course.

543
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,369
You're soaking wet.

544
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:25,541
No, no, I'm fine. I was just with
Mr. Horikoshi, he saved me again.

545
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,043
Jiro Horikoshi.

546
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:31,672
I'm Satomi. It's so very good to meet you, Mr. Horikoshi.

547
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,928
May I sit here?

548
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:21,931
Certainly.

549
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,035
German tobacco. I've been saving it. Last one.

550
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:48,291
I understand. Japanese cigarette always taste like home to me.

551
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:53,045
You must've visited Germany, yes? Perhaps to Dessau?

552
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,549
Oh, you must be Sherlock Holmes.

553
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,968
You read magazines.

554
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:03,306
German magazines about airplanes.
All Japanese engineers

555
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:07,310
visit Dessau. It's elementary. my dear Watson.

556
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,314
You cracked the case.

557
01:15:12,507 --> 01:15:16,610
- Dr. Junkers is in trouble.
- In trouble?

558
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,325
He fights the hand that feeds him and he will lose.

559
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,827
He fights Mr. Hitler's government?

560
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:28,331
The Nazis are a gang of hoodlums.

561
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,167
This is quite a good place.

562
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:35,838
No mosquitoes.
Not too hot. Good watercress.

563
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:38,799
A good place to forget bad things.
Isn't that right?

564
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,344
Cigarette? I'm afraid
they're Japanese.

565
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,678
Thank you.

566
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:52,355
It is a nice night.
"Hier ist der Zauberberg."

567
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,565
"The Magic Mountain"
by Thomas Mann?

568
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,360
Yes, a good place for forgetting.

569
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,696
Make a war in China. Forget it.

570
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,949
Make a puppet state
in Manchuria. Forget it.

571
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,370
Quit the League of Nations.
Forget it.

572
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,206
Make the world your enemy.
Forget it.

573
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,875
Japan will blow up.

574
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,878
Germany will blow up too.

575
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:20,549
- Do you think Germany will go to war again?
- Yes. They must be stopped.

576
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,762
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting.

577
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,390
Naoko has a fever.

578
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:30,559
We'll have to cancel our dinner plans.

579
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:34,563
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I hope that she feels better soon.

580
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,900
The doctor will be here soon.
I must go.

581
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,519
"Who has seen the wind?"

582
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,688
"Neither I nor you."

583
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:45,860
"But when the leaves hang trembling,
the wind is passing through."

584
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:53,501
Let the wind carry these wings,

585
01:18:53,728 --> 01:18:55,913
carry these wings to you.

586
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,450
Jiro?

587
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,910
Naoko!

588
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:56,765
Be careful!

589
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:57,803
Nice catch.

590
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:14,630
Bravo! Bravo!

591
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,466
Well, is your daughter feeling better?

592
01:23:17,992 --> 01:23:19,968
Yes, thank you, much better.

593
01:23:19,994 --> 01:23:21,470
Wonderful.

594
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:25,307
This is the magic mountain.
It cures everyone.

595
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,476
I think you're right.

596
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:32,314
At the begining, this young
man was very gloomy.

597
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,483
Now he is very happy

598
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:36,693
because he's in love.

599
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:38,654
Yes.

600
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,658
But summer love is seasonal.

601
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:46,495
You will go down the mountain
and forget all about it.

602
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:48,664
That's not true.

603
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:53,502
This love of yours, it wouldn't be about my daughter, right?

604
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,838
Yes sir, I love her very much.

605
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:00,217
And I sincerely hope you'll approve, Mr Satomi.

606
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:02,845
Well, I don't, uh...

607
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,179
Father!

608
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,267
I would very much like to have your approval too.

609
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,519
Now, that's a beauty.

610
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:16,859
But Jiro, there's something
I need you to understand.

611
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:17,985
Anything.

612
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:22,197
My mother died of tuberculosis 
two years ago.

613
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,200
And now I have it too.

614
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:29,955
Naoko, I'm in love with you. Nothing ever going to stop me.

615
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:34,376
I've loved you since the day the
wind brought you to me.

616
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:36,879
Will you please marry me.

617
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:38,005
Yes.

618
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:42,217
But I first I'm gonna get well.
Will you please wait for me?

619
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:45,220
I'll, even if it's gonna take a hundred years.

620
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,389
Congratulations.

621
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:52,144
He is a nice young man
and your daughter is wonderful.

622
01:24:53,087 --> 01:24:56,106
This is a summer to remember.

623
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:21,423
- If it isn't the long lost Jiro!
- Honjo!

624
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,759
- When did you get back?
- Two days ago.

625
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,427
Hot, isn't it?

626
01:25:28,122 --> 01:25:30,098
Come, take a look at this.

627
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,271
She's beautiful.

628
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,440
Good clean lines.

629
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,948
They gave me free rein, so I designed something radical.

630
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,284
But it won't mount to anything if she doesn't fly.

631
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:53,288
Oh, I'm sure she'll fly.
I feel the wind rising.

632
01:26:14,168 --> 01:26:18,313
Honjo, you've closed the gap and in one huge step.

633
01:26:19,173 --> 01:26:21,149
My plane was just a tin duckling.

634
01:26:21,175 --> 01:26:22,985
But here's an idea for you.

635
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,654
I thought of it too late to implement on my plane.

636
01:26:28,182 --> 01:26:30,993
It's a way to reduce drag by using 

637
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,828
flathead screws on all the access hatches

638
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:39,499
and the fueling port. Maintenance will be easy with a hinge on one side.

639
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:45,507
I think a spring of this diameter
should be fine.

640
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:49,428
Jiro, that's it! What a great idea, as usual.

641
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:50,679
You should use it.

642
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,348
Thanks pal, but not this time.

643
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:56,810
I'll keep these but I won't use them

644
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:00,188
before you. Your idea belongs in your next plane.

645
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:02,357
Thanks, Honjo.

646
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,985
You're welcome. You better hurry up.

647
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:07,863
Jiro! Where are you?

648
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,866
- Mr. Kurokawa.
- Jiro.

649
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,200
Get back to the office!

650
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:13,535
Thanks. I'm coming!

651
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,537
- Come to the house for a drink next time.
- Sure!

652
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,372
Jiro, you pedal.

653
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:25,047
- The Secret Police are looking for you.
- Oh, what?

654
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,383
Did you hear me? The fight crime boys.

655
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,218
But why me?

656
01:27:30,244 --> 01:27:32,554
Didn't ask. 
I told them you were away.

657
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:46,735
They're just pretending to leave.
We won't fall for that.

658
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,571
You work up here today.
I've arranged it.

659
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:52,574
But why would they possibly be after me? I don't understand.

660
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:58,080
They've already arrested some of my friends.
None of them understood why.

661
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,582
Enter.

662
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:02,084
Here's your stuff.

663
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,921
I think we got everything.

664
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,589
I can go back and check.

665
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,592
- Nah, just leave it and go.
- Jiro, the flange is here!

666
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,594
Can't wait to see it!

667
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:24,439
It's perfect.

668
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,441
Sure is. I wish we had that a year ago.

669
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,235
So, what do you think, Jiro?

670
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:32,614
Our next plane won't just be a duckling, it'll be a full-grown duck.

671
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,951
A full metal duck.

672
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,702
Mr. Kurokawa, what do you think?

673
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:42,290
I hope you youngsters appreciate the luxury of extruded aluminum alloy.

674
01:28:42,316 --> 01:28:44,042
That's it, now back to work!

675
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:58,640
- Alright, the coast looks clear.
- Okay, Jiro.

676
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:03,145
You should keep a low profile for a few days, just in case.

677
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,313
We'll try to smooth things over.

678
01:29:05,381 --> 01:29:07,149
I'll put you up at my house.

679
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:10,277
Can we stop at my apartment first?
I've to check my mail.

680
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,654
Is it sensitive?

681
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,322
Yes, it's very sensitive.

682
01:29:14,557 --> 01:29:16,658
The police will be
opening all your mail.

683
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:18,243
It's from my fiancée.

684
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:21,997
This is outrageous. These things shouldn't happen in a modern country.

685
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:25,500
You're engaged?

686
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:28,503
You're a human after all.

687
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:30,839
I thought you would marry an airplane!

688
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,382
I don't find that very funny!

689
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:36,011
Of course it's not funny.
The police are waiting for you at your apartment.

690
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,388
If they want to read your love letters, let them!

691
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:42,017
Jiro, we need you to focus on the fighter project.

692
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:47,022
That's why we sent you away to rest after the crash. The company will do everything to protect you.

693
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:49,524
If you keep your mind in your work.

694
01:29:50,593 --> 01:29:54,196
<i>I can't bear being apart from you.<i>

695
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:59,699
<i>Why do you suppose the police are looking for Mr. Castorp? He left so suddenly.<i>

696
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:15,133
<i>I pray everyday that he managed to
leave Japan safely.<i>

697
01:30:32,468 --> 01:30:34,236
Jiro, you've a telephone call.

699
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,740
- The telephone is over there.
- Thank you, Mrs. Kurokawa.

700
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:44,579
- Hello?
- <i>Jiro? It's me. You have a telegram.<i>

701
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:45,705
Yes?

702
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:50,252
<i>Your landlord received it two days ago. We just brought it in here now.<i>

703
01:30:50,653 --> 01:30:51,920
Would you please read it to me?

704
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:53,255
- <i>Now?<i>
- Yes

705
01:30:55,324 --> 01:31:00,011
"Nahoko...has had
a lung...heh, heh...

706
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:02,597
hemorrhage. Satomi."

707
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:11,439
<i>Jiro? Are you still there?<i>

708
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,276
Thank you. I've to go now.

709
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:15,944
<i>Jiro, wait!<i>

710
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:19,781
What is it?

711
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:24,035
Mrs. Kurokawa, please, I need to know the quickest way to get to Tokyo!

712
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,620
Tokyo? Today?

713
01:31:25,688 --> 01:31:28,290
Yes, it's an emergency. I have to be there as soon as possible.

714
01:31:28,357 --> 01:31:30,125
Alright.

715
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:34,462
If you take the noon bus, then you'll just be able to catch the express.

716.1
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:37,632
- I'll send someone to hold the bus for you. Go get your things.
- Thank you.

717
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,301
Jiya!

718
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:27,909
Darling!

719
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:40,088
I'm sorry I wasn't here sooner.

720
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:47,262
You'll catch it.

721
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:48,930
You're beautiful.

722
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:51,099
I love you.

723
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,270
Jiro? Through the garden?

724
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:06,281
Come in, father.

725
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,952
Father, look who's here? Jiro.

726
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:13,621
He came all the way from Nagoya
but can't stay for long.

727
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:18,293
- I'll be sure to use the front door the next time I come
- Hah, the garden, it's faster.

728
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:20,295
Okay, garden it is.

729
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:22,630
Take care, my darling.

730
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:24,299
Sleep well.

731
01:34:25,701 --> 01:34:27,302
Goodnight, sir.

732
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,636
I'll see you out.

733
01:34:33,876 --> 01:34:36,978
<i>You better hurry if you gonna catch the last train.<i>

734
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:42,650
I wish I could look after her, 
Mr. Satomi. She seems so tired.

735
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:46,154
The last thing Naoko wants is 
to be a burden to you.

736
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:47,989
You better go.

737
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:56,998
Naoko?

738
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,001
Are you alright?

739
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:07,342
I'm going to the sanatorium in the mountain, the one the doctor recommended.

740
01:35:07,576 --> 01:35:11,012
Why? It's so far and I don't want you to be alone.

741
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:13,515
Because I want to get better, father. 

742
01:35:13,707 --> 01:35:15,850
I want to have a life with Jiro.

743
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:24,526
Just made it.
The whole board is waiting.

744
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:33,284
So, are you ready?

745
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:35,787
Gentleman, I'll do my best.

746
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:38,706
Now you'll see the Navy.
They're the client.

747
01:35:49,618 --> 01:35:51,302
Gentleman, I'll do my best.

748
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:54,055
- You weren't even listening.
- Nope.

749
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,726
So I gave up on that idea.

750
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:04,899
- Very well, they're late.
- Jiro's in the middle of a review with the design team.

751
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:10,405
I wanted this design to use
the latest aeronautical advances.

752
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:13,575
- Take a look.
- Retractable undercarriage!

753
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:16,244
It's built to reach 270 knots.

754
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:19,706
270 knots?
That's 500 kilometers per hour!

755
01:36:19,982 --> 01:36:22,458
But the Navy only 
asked for 220 knots.

756
01:36:22,985 --> 01:36:25,420
220 will be obselete by next week.

757
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:28,590
The wing load is 120 kilos
per square meter.

758
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:33,261
Minimal drag will be the key.
I pushed the design to the limit   

759
01:36:33,829 --> 01:36:36,764
of technology,
with split flaps and slats on the leading edges.

760
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,116
We can do it!

761
01:36:55,434 --> 01:36:57,493
When do we start?

762
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:00,496
But the weight becomes the big problem.

763
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:06,628
One solution would be, we could leave out the guns.

764
01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:16,137
So, I decided to put this design back on the shelf.

765
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:19,307
This is refreshing, delightful.

766
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:20,892
He nearly had it.

767
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:23,436
But we're not giving up because
our engines 

768
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:26,648
are underpowered.
We'll build a light, strong air frame.

769
01:37:26,715 --> 01:37:30,985
We'll cut every ounce of excess weight and minimize drag with a smooth skin.

770
01:37:31,053 --> 01:37:33,821
We're going to build
an all-metal fighter,

771
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:36,157
like nothing the world has ever seen!

772
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:38,326
I have a question!

773
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:40,161
Mr. Hirayama, please.

774
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:44,332
This is Mr. Hirayama, he's our
production engineer.

775
01:37:44,733 --> 01:37:45,625
Thank you, sir.

776
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:50,838
He's going to tell us about the new rivets that he's developing.

777
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:57,136
I believe it's technically possible to match the strength of conventional rivets with rivets that are flushed.

778
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:58,680
What's he talking about?

779
01:37:59,081 --> 01:38:00,640
A new way to cut drag.

780
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:06,229
We're going to skin the entire
plane with flushed rivets to produce a nimble, fast aircraft.

781
01:38:06,255 --> 01:38:08,690
- Question!
- I have a question!

782
01:38:11,093 --> 01:38:13,528
I must say, that was interesting.

783
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:15,196
It was inspiring.

784
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,552
Miss Satomi, today's letter.

785
01:38:37,786 --> 01:38:39,554
Thank you.

786
01:39:59,034 --> 01:40:00,635
Chief, you've a phone call.

787
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:03,930
- I'll have to call him back.
- I think it's an emergency.

788
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:07,308
Hello, Mr. Satomi. Good to hear from you, sir.

789
01:40:07,876 --> 01:40:09,477
Yes, yes, what?

790
01:41:22,284 --> 01:41:24,385
- Jiro!
- I'm here now. 

791
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:27,222
- Jiro!
- I'm here.

792
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:32,727
You alright, my love? Can you walk?

793
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:35,062
Come.

794
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:45,406
I've to go back.
I just needed to see you.

795
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:46,407
No, don't go back.

796
01:41:50,145 --> 01:41:51,913
We should be together.

797
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:07,261
- Oh, you must be Naoko.
- Please to meet you.

798
01:42:07,329 --> 01:42:10,097
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Jiro.

799
01:42:10,165 --> 01:42:12,433
Mr. Kurokawa,
we've a request.

800
01:42:13,335 --> 01:42:15,436
We've plenty of room, dear.

801
01:42:15,504 --> 01:42:17,271
I know we've the room,

802
01:42:17,339 --> 01:42:22,610
that's not the problem. I simply can't approve an unmarried couple living under this roof.

803
01:42:23,178 --> 01:42:24,779
Then we'll marry tonight.

804
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:27,865
Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa,
will you please be our witnesses.

805
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:29,450
What? Tonight?

806
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:31,619
Of course we'll, dear.

807
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:35,122
Naoko travelled all this way, it's the least we can do.

808
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:39,627
My doctors know about this and my father has given his blessing.

809
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:41,128
Please, help us.

810
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:46,801
The bride and I have a lot of work to do, and so do you.

811
01:42:47,202 --> 01:42:48,803
Come, Naoko.

812
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,478
Oh, don't mind him, he's always like that.

813
01:43:01,383 --> 01:43:06,320
If you care about her at all, Jiro, you'll send her back on the morning train.

814
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:11,659
I'll have to give up the fighter project, Mr. Kurokawa, because I would go with her. 

815
01:43:11,894 --> 01:43:15,162
Is that your heart
or your ego talking?

816
01:43:16,064 --> 01:43:19,417
Naoko doesn't have much time.
We've made our decision.

817
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:21,836
I see.

818
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:25,172
All right.
So I guess it's on with wedding!

819
01:43:49,848 --> 01:43:51,198
Here they come.

820
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:53,701
She's coming!

821
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:18,225
Hear me! I bring to you a lovely maiden who has come from the mountain

822
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:23,898
to be with her beloved.
She has given up everything for him. What say you?

823
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:27,401
Hear me! The man I present is
an insensitive  

824
01:44:27,469 --> 01:44:29,737
charcoal head
without even a home to call his own.

825
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:33,240
but if that's what she wants, she can come in.

826
01:44:33,308 --> 01:44:36,911
And then, they shall exchange
the sacred vows.

827
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:00,935
You're beautiful.

828
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:39,640
Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa.

829
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:44,979
All Jiro and I've in this world is each other, I cannot thank you enough for your kindness.

830
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:47,648
We will never forget
our debt to you.

831
01:45:50,385 --> 01:45:55,489
Nonsense, there's absolutely no debt to repay. We're both so happy that you've found each other.

832
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:56,657
Aren't we, dear?

833
01:45:56,725 --> 01:46:00,995
Um...hmm, you both are very, very brave!

834
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:18,179
You must be exhausted.

835
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:22,683
I feel like I'm in a wonderful dream. Feel like the room is spinning.

836
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:25,144
You should try to get some rest.

837
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:27,271
Come here.

838
01:46:27,589 --> 01:46:29,023
Are you sure?

839
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:32,359
Come here.

840
01:47:14,052 --> 01:47:16,737
- Kayo!
- You're going to tell me you completely forgotten I was coming?

841
01:47:16,763 --> 01:47:18,447
Yes, I completely forgot you were coming.

842
01:47:18,723 --> 01:47:20,699
You're so insensitive.

843
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:25,037
Congratulations on
finishing medical school.

844
01:47:25,063 --> 01:47:28,040
Congratulations on your marriage to Naoko.

845
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:31,877
I've come to thank Mr. and  Mrs. Kurokawa 
on behalf of the entire family.

846
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:33,379
Are they still up?

847
01:47:33,488 --> 01:47:35,047
They've gone to bed.

848
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,383
- So, you've met Naoko?
- Yes.

849
01:47:41,246 --> 01:47:46,225
Jiro, what're you going to do?
She's alone in that room all day.

850
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:50,187
You won't know it because you come home so late!

851
01:47:50,255 --> 01:47:53,232
Do you know she puts rouge on her cheek so that you won't worry? 

852
01:47:53,758 --> 01:47:59,071
Naoko condition is much worse than you think, Jiro. I know because at school I watch these people...

853
01:48:00,432 --> 01:48:04,076
She's my sister now. I really like her.

854
01:48:04,102 --> 01:48:06,370
How can you do this to her?

855
01:48:10,817 --> 01:48:13,252
Does Naoko really have to stay here?

856
01:48:13,278 --> 01:48:14,420
Yes.

857
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:19,758
She does because each day together is very precious to us now.

858
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:26,664
Get some rest. We can talk more in the morning. I'm glad you're here.

859
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:41,780
I'm home.

860
01:48:41,806 --> 01:48:44,116
- I must have dozed off.
- Go back to sleep.

861
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:53,625
- Thank you.
- Did you see your sister?
- Yes.

862
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:56,628
I like her a lot.

863
01:48:57,656 --> 01:49:01,633
So confident and strong. She has got
such a bright future ahead of her.

864
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:06,138
I told her I wanted her to be my doctor.

865
01:49:07,499 --> 01:49:12,311
She brought me a gift from your mother, this nightgown and robe. 

866
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:14,688
See, she made it for me.

867
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:16,899
Is that too bright?

868
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:18,901
No, it's fine.

869
01:49:21,012 --> 01:49:23,489
I have to finish
the design by tomorrow.

870
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:24,990
Your Mackerel bones?

871
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:26,825
You remembered.

872
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:30,496
I think I may have a way to make it a bit lighter.

873
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:34,541
Come a little closer.

874
01:49:43,868 --> 01:49:45,511
Give me your hand.

875
01:49:48,707 --> 01:49:53,018
This is nice. I really like looking at you while you're working, Jiro.

876
01:49:53,545 --> 01:49:58,357
On a contest for one-handed slide ruler users, I'd win first prize for sure.

877
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:02,528
Look at that, I can make each rib
half an ounce lighter.

878
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:04,530
You can? That's good.

879
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:06,865
Thirty ribs, that almost make a pound.

880
01:50:07,058 --> 01:50:08,492
See, I knew it.

881
01:50:08,893 --> 01:50:11,495
You were better when you're holding my hand.

882
01:50:11,896 --> 01:50:16,208
You're right. If only I could leave my hand right here for a test-flight.

883
01:50:21,906 --> 01:50:24,383
You my dear,
should get some sleep.

884
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:27,719
- Don't let go.
- No, I won't let go.

885
01:50:30,081 --> 01:50:33,559
I need a cigarette.
Can I let go for a minute?

886
01:50:33,752 --> 01:50:36,228
No, smoke here.

887
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:38,730
- It's not good for you.
- I don't care.

888
01:50:58,109 --> 01:50:59,751
Hey, Honjo.

889
01:50:59,944 --> 01:51:01,420
Can I take a look?

890
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:04,631
- Sure. I hear good things about your heavy bomber.
- Ah, it's not bad.

891
01:51:04,783 --> 01:51:08,927
Jiro, she's beautiful.

892
01:51:12,123 --> 01:51:14,433
The infamous flush riveting.

893
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,269
Feels a little rough.

894
01:51:18,296 --> 01:51:20,105
Yea, we're still learning how to do it.

895
01:51:20,298 --> 01:51:25,277
Well, you'll get it. You already left the Germans behind.
I'm still stuck with them.

896
01:51:27,722 --> 01:51:32,075
This design is classic Jiro,
right down to the Mackerel bones.

897
01:51:34,312 --> 01:51:39,625
Jiro, is it alright if I use your flush rivets and that spring-loaded hatch.

898
01:51:39,651 --> 01:51:41,460
Um...hmm, of course.

899
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:42,794
Skeched a redesign?

900
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:47,132
Yeah, I wanted to redo the whole thing but they only let me touch the fuselage.

901
01:51:47,492 --> 01:51:48,967
But, what about the wings?

902
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:52,346
That's what keeps me up at night. The wings still carry all the fuel

903
01:51:52,831 --> 01:51:56,642
and I can't shield them because she has to fly over 1,800 miles.

904
01:51:56,668 --> 01:52:00,771
It's already too heavy. We can't even add an ounce of weight.

905
01:52:02,674 --> 01:52:06,652
So without a redesign, Japan's first advance bomber

906
01:52:07,011 --> 01:52:10,655
only needs 2 or 3 hits and she will burn like a torch.

907
01:52:22,777 --> 01:52:24,670
And who are they going to bomb with it?

908
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:28,840
China. Russia. Britain.
The Netherlands. America.

909
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:30,342
Japan will blow up.

910
01:52:31,202 --> 01:52:35,180
We're not arms merchants. We just
want to build good aircraft.

911
01:52:35,206 --> 01:52:36,181
That's right.

912
01:52:36,207 --> 01:52:38,183
Good night, pal. Try to get some sleep.

913
01:52:38,209 --> 01:52:40,227
You too.

914
01:52:41,379 --> 01:52:42,854
<i>Boss, I'm calling it a day.<i>

915
01:52:43,047 --> 01:52:44,356
<i>Good night, sir.<i>

916
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:45,899
Good night.

917
01:53:11,075 --> 01:53:12,718
Welcome home.

918
01:53:13,077 --> 01:53:16,221
My plane is finished.
Now we'll see how she flies.

919
01:53:16,414 --> 01:53:19,558
Congratulations.
You worked so hard.

920
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:23,103
The oxen are taking her way to the field now.

921
01:53:23,254 --> 01:53:25,897
I'll probably have to spend the next few nights there.

922
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:28,567
You must be tired, my love.

923
01:53:30,762 --> 01:53:32,362
Just a little.

924
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:34,573
She will fly beautifully.

925
01:53:34,933 --> 01:53:37,367
Hmm, she will.

926
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,954
I couldn't have done
it without you here.

927
01:53:41,272 --> 01:53:43,415
I love you, Jiro.

928
01:53:44,108 --> 01:53:45,584
Naoko...

929
01:54:38,663 --> 01:54:39,971
I'm off.

930
01:54:39,998 --> 01:54:41,473
Good luck.

931
01:55:07,859 --> 01:55:09,710
What are you doing up?

932
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:15,006
I'm feeling so much better today, Mrs. Kurokawa. So I thought I'll take a walk.

933
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:18,009
- Be careful, don't tire yourself out.
- I know.

934
01:55:19,037 --> 01:55:23,348
The room's still a mess but I'll straighten it up when I get back.

935
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:26,017
All right but remember,

936
01:55:26,044 --> 01:55:28,854
Kayo's coming soon to be here for her brother's celebration.

937
01:55:29,047 --> 01:55:31,022
Yes. I'll be back soon.

938
01:56:12,423 --> 01:56:14,566
Please come inside.

939
01:56:20,598 --> 01:56:22,574
Oh, no.

940
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:34,503
she left us letters!
This letter is for me.

941
01:56:40,284 --> 01:56:44,596
Says she's going back to the sanatorium! I'll find her.

942
01:56:44,789 --> 01:56:46,264
No! Let her go.

943
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:52,771
We shouldn't do anything
until after Naoko's train leaves.

944
01:56:54,298 --> 01:56:58,109
She wants him to always remember her as she was.

945
01:57:44,932 --> 01:57:48,785
Wonderful, just look at her, true Japanese fighter.

946
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:50,996
What about speed?
How she do? 

947
01:57:51,189 --> 01:57:54,583
The numbers, they're off the charts. We're checking them again.

948
01:57:54,692 --> 01:57:56,001
How fast is she?

949
01:57:56,027 --> 01:57:59,337
- 240.
- Two forty?

950
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:37,542
- Fantastic!
- What a fighter.

951
01:58:38,736 --> 01:58:40,211
Hey, Jiro.

952
01:58:40,571 --> 01:58:41,880
Jiro!

953
01:58:49,747 --> 01:58:52,724
She flies like a dream.
Thank you.

954
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:08,842
So, we meet again, Japanese boy.

955
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:11,302
Mr. Caproni...

956
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:18,143
I remember this place.
This is where we first met

957
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:20,645
in our kingdom of dreams.

958
02:00:21,088 --> 02:00:22,814
Now it's the land of the dead.

959
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:25,817
Not quite but in some ways, yes.

960
02:00:26,177 --> 02:00:30,238
But what about your ten years in the sun, did you live them well?

961
02:00:30,264 --> 02:00:33,158
Yes. Things fell apart in the end, though.

962
02:00:33,351 --> 02:00:35,952
That's what happen when you lose a war.

963
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:38,663
There's your fighter.

964
02:01:16,018 --> 02:01:18,870
Truly, truly a masterful design.

965
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:21,539
Not a single one returned.

966
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:24,209
There was nothing to return to.

967
02:01:24,402 --> 02:01:27,504
Airplanes are beautiful 
curse of dreams,

968
02:01:27,655 --> 02:01:30,090
waiting for the sky 
to swallow them up.

969
02:01:31,659 --> 02:01:33,551
Someone is waiting for you.

970
02:01:48,634 --> 02:01:49,734
Naoko...

971
02:01:49,927 --> 02:01:53,196
She's been waiting
here for a long time.

972
02:01:53,597 --> 02:01:56,074
You must live, darling.

973
02:02:00,312 --> 02:02:01,579
You must live...

974
02:02:23,794 --> 02:02:25,770
She was beautiful,

975
02:02:27,131 --> 02:02:29,607
like the wind.

976
02:02:30,968 --> 02:02:34,779
Thank you. Thank you.

977
02:02:36,223 --> 02:02:38,449
You must live.

978
02:02:38,642 --> 02:02:43,329
But now, shall we drop by my house?
I've some very excellent wine.
