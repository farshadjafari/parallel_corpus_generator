HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE

3
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,811
Miss Sophie

4
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,354
I've closed up the shop

5
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,941
You should come too, Sophie

6
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:50,027
I'll just finish this
Go have some fun

7
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,153
All right, then, I'm off

8
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,448
I'm going

9
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,575
Look, it's Howl's castle

10
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,161
What? Howl? Where, where?

11
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,204
Look how close it is

12
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,248
Oh, no

13
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,334
I wonder if Howl's in town

14
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,592
It took off

15
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,346
No, just hiding
from all the soldiers

16
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:20,056
Say, did you hear?
Remember Martha, from South Haven?

17
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,560
They say Howl tore her heart out

18
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,561
How scary...

19
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,062
Don't worry, he's not going
to want yours

20
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,191
Hurry up

21
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,485
Really?

22
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,156
Oh, cut it out...

23
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,194
Hey there little mouse,
lost your way?

24
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,363
Oh, no... I'm fine

25
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,908
Then how about a cup of tea?

26
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,284
Care to join me?

27
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,077
No thank you, I'm busy

28
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,831
She sure is a cute little mouse

29
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:51,165
Say, how old are you?
You live around here?

30
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,002
Let me pass!

31
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,547
See, it's those whiskers of yours

32
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,632
She's even cuter when she's mad

33
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,509
Hey, there, I'm sorry

34
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,886
Where've you been?

35
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:04,346
Who are you?

36
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,889
I'm with her

37
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,850
Why don't you two take
a little walk

38
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,564
What the... '?
Hey, wha...

39
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,817
Don't hold it against them

40
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,153
They're harmless

41
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,490
Where to? I'll be your escort

42
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,076
No, really, I'm only going to Cesari's

43
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,786
Act normal
I'm being followed

44
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,079
Just walk

45
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,228
Sorry, I got you involved

46
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,192
This way

47
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:06,742
Hold on

48
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,250
Drop your legs, keep walking

49
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,966
That's right, don't be frightened

50
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,942
Very nice

51
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,792
I'll draw them off

52
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,627
Wait here until the coast is clear

53
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,170
Yes

54
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,338
That's my girl

55
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,437
Any chocolate Letties?

56
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,062
Look this way, Lettie

57
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,189
- Hey, make room
- Let's go for a walk, Lettie

58
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,274
My sister?

59
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,694
Come back soon, Lettie

60
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,615
Sophie?

61
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,161
How did you land
on the veranda like that?

62
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,663
Have you become an angel?

63
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,875
It feels like I'm in a dream...

64
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,209
Lettie, why not use the office?

65
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,672
Thanks, but I should really
be working

66
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,427
What?
You sure he wasn't a wizard?

67
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,512
He was so kind...

68
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,514
He rescued me...

69
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,350
Don't tell me he's stolen your heart

70
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:01,064
If that was the wizard Howl,
he'd have eaten it right up

71
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,067
Don't worry,
Howl's only after beauties

72
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,987
There you go again

73
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,365
Listen to me,
we live in dangerous times

74
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,285
They say even the Witch of the Waste
is back on the prowl

75
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,870
Sophie?

76
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:18,874
Oh, you...

77
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,836
Lettie, the Madeleines are done

78
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,214
Okay, be right there

79
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,507
All right

80
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,886
I'm going home

81
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,221
It's a relief to know
you're doing well

82
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,350
Hello, Lettie

83
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,558
Nice to see you

84
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:41,562
Listen, are you going to spend
your whole life in that shop?

85
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:46,692
It meant so much to Papa
Besides, I'm the eldest

86
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,780
That's not what I meant
Are you sure you want to be a hatter?

87
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,365
Well, I...

88
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,700
Bye, Lettie

89
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,159
Come by the shop next time

90
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,161
Sure

91
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,412
I'll be on my way

92
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:01,250
Sophie, you've got to
look out for yourself

93
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,570
Sorry, the shop's closed

94
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,155
I thought I'd looked the door

95
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:21,163
What a cheap shop,
full of cheap little hats

96
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,333
And you're quite cheap-looking yourself

97
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,254
This is just a simple hat shop

98
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,511
I think you had better leave

99
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,017
You're very brave, taking on
the Witch of the Waste

100
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,186
The Witch of the Waste?

101
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:55,197
You won't be able to tell anyone
about that spell

102
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,615
My regards to Howl

103
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,831
Is this really me!

104
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,417
I've got to stay calm

105
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,768
I've got to calm down

106
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,645
It's no use panicking, Sophie

107
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,817
I'll be fine, I'll be fine

108
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,780
I've got to calm down

109
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,626
I'm back!

110
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,211
Welcome home, Ma'am!

111
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,922
- Welcome home
- How do you like it?

112
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,883
It's all the rage in Kingsbury

113
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,091
Amazing

114
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,134
It suits you

115
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,553
Don't you think it's wonderful?

116
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,471
Sophie!

117
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,309
Mrs. Hatter, Sophie hasn't come down
to work yet

118
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,312
I wonder what's the matter?

119
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,316
Sophie!

120
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,908
Don't come in

121
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,326
I've got an awful cold

122
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,162
I don't want you to catch it

123
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,914
You sound just awful...

124
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,042
Like some 90 year-old woman

125
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,878
I'll stay in bed today

126
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,672
You sure? All right, then

127
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,927
Here we go...

128
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,855
You'll be fine, old lady

129
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:39,193
You're still healthy, and these clothes
finally suit you

130
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,032
But I can't stay here

131
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,876
Ouch, ouch

132
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,922
It's not easy being old

133
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,643
They're saying this war
is going to be terrible...

134
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,573
Like a hand, granny?

135
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:29,619
Such a gentleman,
but I'll manage

136
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,331
Sure, old lady,
but where are you off to?

137
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,084
Just a bit farther than where
you're going

138
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,841
I don't recommend it, granny

139
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,594
Nothing but witches and wizards ahead

140
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,511
Thank you

141
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,599
Going to the Folding Valley,
at this hour?

142
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,100
Says her youngest sister's there

143
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,118
I've hardly made any progress at all

144
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:15,289
Thank goodness I've still got my teeth

145
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,883
That'll make a good cane

146
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,801
Up we go

147
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,393
Might be a bit too thick

148
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,570
Ouch, ouch

149
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,947
What a stubborn branch

150
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,786
Never underestimate
Grandma Sophie

151
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,620
Heave

152
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,677
A Scarecrow, eh? I thought you were
working for the Witch

153
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,972
But how do you stand by yourself?

154
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,601
Your head's a turnip

155
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,438
I've always hated turnips

156
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,192
At least you're not
upside down anymore

157
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,860
So long

158
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,869
It's so cold

159
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,663
The town's still so close

160
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,756
Don't follow me
You don't owe me a thing

161
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,217
You must be a magical whatever-you-are

162
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,096
I've had enough of witches and spells!

163
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,515
Just go stand wherever you like!

164
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:21,040
This is a perfect cane
Thank you kindly

165
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,420
While you're at it, could you bring me
a house to sleep in?

166
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,267
Seems you get more cunning with age

167
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,988
What a huge battleship

168
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,827
I never realized how weak you feel
when you get old

169
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,557
I smell smoke
Maybe there's a cabin

170
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,954
Turnip-head, isn't that Howl's Castle?

171
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:46,125
This is hardly what I meant
when I asked for shelter!

172
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,555
What is this?

173
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,140
You call this a castle?

174
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,412
Is that the way in?

175
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,249
Just wait up there

176
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,086
Hey, there!

177
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,132
Are you going to let me on, or not!

178
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,471
My shawl!

179
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,279
It seems warm enough inside, Turnip
I'm going in

180
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,573
Thank you

181
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:02,576
Even Howl wouldn't want
an ancient heart like mine

182
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,207
This time, it's really goodbye

183
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,167
You may be a turnip,
but you're a good turnip

184
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,211
May you find happiness

185
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:03,680
What is this place?
Just looks like a dilapidated heap

186
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:16,984
Well, one nice thing about getting old
is that nothing surprises you anymore

187
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,788
That's some spell you're under

188
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,750
It won't be easy to break

189
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,877
The fire talked

190
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,381
And you can't even
tell anyone about it

191
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,465
You're Howl?

192
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:45,054
Wrong. I'm the fire demon, Calcifer!

193
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:49,851
Well, then, Calcifer, can you break
the spell I'm under?

194
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,560
Easy

195
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,188
If you break the spell that chains me
to this place,

196
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,857
I'll break your spell in a flash

197
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,528
In other words, bargain with a demon

198
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,904
You sure you can keep that promise?

199
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,575
Demons don't make promises

200
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,869
I suggest you look elsewhere

201
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,079
But I'm an exploited demon

202
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,709
I'm chained here by a contract with Howl,
who works me to death

203
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:17,836
I'm the one who keeps
this castle moving

204
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,548
My, you've got it rough

205
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:26,179
If you figure out the secret contract,
the spell will break

206
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,057
If you do that,
I'll break your spell, too

207
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,603
All right
A bargain, eh?

208
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,901
Granny

209
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,778
Granny

210
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,576
Boy...
I've got my doubts about her

211
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,423
Hey, who's this?

212
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,299
Porthaven!

213
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,469
When did she get in?

214
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,602
Stand by

215
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,983
Why, Mayor, sir

216
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,988
The sun is already high
Is Master Jenkins at home?

217
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,323
The Master is out

218
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,992
I answer in his stead

219
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,454
An invitation from His Majesty

220
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,830
It has come to war

221
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,791
His Majesty desires every wizard

222
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,795
and magician, even the witches,
to aid our homeland

223
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,173
His presence is imperative
That is all

224
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,510
War, how awful

225
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,346
And who might you be?

226
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,766
Calcifer let me in

227
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:39,144
Don't look at me
She wandered in from the Wastes

228
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,688
The Wastes?

229
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:44,025
That's strange
You're not a witch, are you?

230
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,903
A witch could never get in

231
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,363
Porthaven, again

232
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,615
A customer?

233
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,911
Stand by

234
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,624
State your purpose

235
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,375
Mama sent me

236
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,545
The usual spell?

237
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,007
Behave yourself, now

238
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,442
It's not the Wastes

239
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,362
Granny, are you a witch, too?

240
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:34,200
That's right,
I'm the scariest witch in the land

241
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,327
Sprinkle this powder on your ship
and the winds will favor it

242
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,496
Sure

243
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,415
Many thanks

244
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,836
I can't have you making up things

245
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,838
You should give up that disguise

246
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,759
It's not a disguise, it's magic

247
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,387
The Kingsbury door

248
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,057
Stand by

249
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,398
Is this the residence of
Wizard Pendragon?

250
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,607
It is, indeed

251
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,944
I bear an invitation
from His Majesty

252
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:15,449
Please inform Master Pendragon
that he is required at the Palace

253
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,286
Our thanks to you

254
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,635
A city fit for a king

255
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,388
Get back in or you'll lose your nose

256
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,813
Stop wandering around

257
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,934
That's enough!
I'm going to get really mad

258
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,896
This is a magic house, isn't it?

259
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,022
Oh, boy!

260
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,317
Where does the black one lead?

261
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,692
Only Master Howl knows

262
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,695
I'm having my breakfast

263
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,375
But you've got bacon and eggs

264
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:51,420
We can't use the fire
when Master Howl's away

265
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,884
I'll cook for you

266
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,426
But you can't

267
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,513
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl

268
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:04,724
That's right, I won't cook for you

269
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,019
Oh, here's my hat

270
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:13,733
All right, Calcifer
Be a good fire, now

271
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,403
Forget it, I'm a demon

272
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,073
I answer to no one

273
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,742
You'll do as I say,
or I'll pour water on you

274
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,746
Or would you rather I told Howl
about our bargain?

275
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:31,085
Hey! Hey!
I never should've let this old lady in

276
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:33,086
So, what'll it be?

277
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,551
That's right, there's a good fire

278
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,432
Hey! Hey!
I'll burn the bacon

279
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,101
Calcifer's doing what she says

280
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,936
I'd like some tea, too
Have you got a kettle?

281
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,105
Sure

282
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,490
Welcome home, Master Howl

283
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,701
You have letters from the king

284
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,121
To Jenkins and to Pendragon

285
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,134
Calcifer, you're so obedient

286
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,136
She bullied me

287
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,390
Not an easy thing to do

288
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,349
Who exactly are you?

289
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:31,561
I'm Grandma Sophie

290
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,355
You see, I'm your
new cleaning lady

291
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,025
Give me that

292
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:43,156
Pass me two more bacon slices
and six more eggs

293
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,678
Yummy

294
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,013
Yummy

295
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,147
And who hired you to clean?

296
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,526
Why, I hired myself

297
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:21,028
I've never seen such a filthy house

298
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,904
Hmm

299
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,781
Markl, plates

300
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,746
You're all ganging up on me

301
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,623
Please join us, Sophie

302
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,755
Sit over here

303
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,563
Pick one

304
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,065
Everything else is dirty

305
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,069
I've got my work cut out for me

306
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,406
Markl

307
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,407
Yes

308
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,286
Sophie

309
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,744
Thank you

310
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,833
Brethren, let us partake
of our daily bread

311
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:16,959
Our daily bread

312
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,461
Haven't had a real breakfast
in along while

313
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,137
So many manners to teach...

314
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,974
So, what's that in your pocket?

315
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,269
What?

316
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:45,613
I wonder what it is

317
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,280
Let me

318
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,123
It's scorched into the table
Master Howl, this is...

319
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,750
Ancient sorcery

320
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,126
And powerful, too

321
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,961
The Witch of the Waste?

322
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:06,842
“He who catches a falling star,
oh heartless men

323
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,260
“Your heart shall be mine..."

324
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,762
Well, so much for the table

325
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,487
Wow, it's gone!

326
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:28,989
The Scorch mark has vanished,
but not the spell

327
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,201
Brethren, continue your meal

328
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,497
Calcifer, move the castle
100 kilometers

329
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,128
And send hot water to the bath

330
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,297
Not that, too!

331
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,176
Do you work for the
Witch of the Waste?

332
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:55,516
Don't be stupid! The witch...

333
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:02,940
Actually...
the witch... I...

334
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,026
Confound it!

335
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:10,154
Damn that Witch of the Waste
Wait 'til I get my hands on her!

336
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,199
Let me finish eating this

337
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:19,873
Bugs, you'd better scurry away
or I'll sweep you out

338
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,420
Every last one of you, mocking me

339
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,470
There's a spell I need

340
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,721
Later

341
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,890
A witch rages within

342
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,897
Sophie

343
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:50,069
Sophie, I'm going out

344
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,156
I'll die without some fresh wood

345
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,616
What, what are you doing?

346
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:59,288
I'll fall, I'll fall
I'm in peril

347
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,623
I'm sweeping the ashes

348
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:02,750
Won't be a minute

349
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,792
Oh, no
Oh, no

350
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,586
I'm in danger

351
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,047
I'm in danger...

352
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,632
I'll go out

353
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,722
Oh, no
I'm slipping...

354
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,938
Hurry, Sophie

355
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,130
Try not to torment my friend

356
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,679
Master Howl, are you going out?

357
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:04,644
Markl, tell our cleaning lady
not to get too carried away

358
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,318
What'd you do, Sophie?

359
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,820
She abused me

360
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,240
If I die, Howl goes with me

361
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,826
I'm the cleaning lady

362
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,119
It's my job to clean

363
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,164
No, not the 2nd floor!

364
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,668
If I were you, I'd put your
precious things away in a hurry

365
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,672
Save my room for later

366
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:38,010
My little outburst gave me back
my strength

367
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,891
What a strange house

368
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,139
Amazing!

369
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,391
Calcifer, Calcifer!

370
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,684
Are you moving the castle?

371
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,396
What a lot of fuss! Of course I am

372
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:30,898
You're incredible, Calcifer

373
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:34,443
Your magic's first class
I misjudged you completely

374
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,362
You think so?

375
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,782
You really think so!

376
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,208
Oh, no, not yet!

377
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,074
How beautiful

378
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,202
It's called Star Lake

379
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,251
Something's stuck in there

380
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,753
Oh, dear
Lend me a hand, Markl

381
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:35,878
Sure

382
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:43,302
And up!

383
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,972
A Scarecrow

384
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,931
He's called Turnip, the Turnip-head

385
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,976
You sure like being upside down

386
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,405
The odd creature seems to have
taken a liking to me

387
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,447
He followed me here

388
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,742
Are you sure you're not a witch, Sophie?

389
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:09,496
That's right, I'm the cleanest witch
in the land

390
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,570
Turnip, don't pull it so tight

391
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,873
Seems like he likes doing the wash

392
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,666
They'll dry in no time

393
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:00,547
Turnip must belong to the demons

394
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,382
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him

395
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:05,385
You're right,
maybe he's a demon of the dead

396
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:10,139
But he led me
to this wonderful place

397
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:55,434
I've put away all the laundry, Sophie

398
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,896
Why, thank you
We'd better be getting back

399
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:01,023
How mysterious

400
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:04,568
I've never felt such peace

401
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,231
Stinks

402
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,318
You reek of burnt flesh and steel

403
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,050
Keep flying and one day you
won't be able to change yourself back

404
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:57,181
Isn't it great! Sophie did this for me

405
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,853
The fighting is fierce

406
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:05,940
The country's ablaze, from the
southern coast to the northern border

407
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,275
I hate the fire in gunpowder

408
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,570
They have no manners

409
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,199
My own kind attacked me

410
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,742
The Witch of the Waste?

411
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:19,286
Hack wizards masquerading
as monsters

412
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,666
They'll cry plenty later on,

413
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,126
when they can't regain human form

414
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,588
No, they'll just forget
they ever knew how to cry

415
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:31,590
Aren't you supposed to report
to the king yourself?

416
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,009
Yes, well...

417
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,635
Hot water for my bath

418
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,637
Oh, no, not again

419
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,922
Is that Howl?

420
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,300
Yeah, wasting my hot water again

421
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,557
I'm sure Howl won't eat any breakfast

422
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,766
No matter'

423
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,351
Morning

424
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,481
It's lovely shopping in the morning

425
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,443
I've never seen the ocean

426
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:34,237
Such beautiful, sparkling water

427
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,280
Same as it always is

428
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,500
I myself hate potatoes

429
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,668
Pay up

430
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,210
Thank you

431
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:51,463
Thanks

432
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,842
Fish, all fresh off the boat

433
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,260
That one's tasty

434
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,304
I myself hate fish

435
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,139
The fleet's come home

436
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,224
Is that the smoke?

437
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:04,851
There's been another battle

438
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,186
Really? Sorry, lady, later

439
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,771
That ship's on fire!

440
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,255
Sophie, let's go get a closer look

441
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,467
No, I've no stomach for such things
Let's go home

442
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,887
Our most advanced battleship,
reduced to this

443
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,936
Markl, there are Blob Men nearby

444
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,603
Don't move

445
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,856
They work for the Witch of the Waste

446
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:58,987
They're gone

447
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,365
Don't people notice
those terrible monsters?

448
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,956
Look! Up there!

449
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,041
That's what dropped those bombs!

450
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,043
An enemy airship, Sophie

451
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:20,802
Sophie, flyers

452
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,139
Ignore the flyers
They're enemy propaganda!

453
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,394
Are you OK, Sophie?

454
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,737
A glass of water, please

455
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:39,862
Sure

456
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:58,505
Sophie, what did you do
to the bathroom shelves? Look!

457
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,634
My hair's turned this weird color!

458
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:03,594
What... what beautiful hair

459
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,762
Take a good look!

460
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,349
You mixed up everything on
the shelves and ruined the spells

461
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:12,144
I didn't mix up anything,
I simply cleaned up

462
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,146
Cleaning, always cleaning

463
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:17,483
I told you not to get
too carried away

464
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,360
It's hopeless

465
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,322
How humiliating

466
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,284
It's not so very bad

467
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,045
This new shade's quite lovely
in its way

468
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:42,050
I'm done for. What's the point
in living, if you aren't beautiful...

469
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,481
Stop, Howl! Cut it out!

470
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,858
He's calling on
the spirits of Darkness

471
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:02,027
He did this last time
a girl ditched him

472
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,407
Please, Howl, that's enough

473
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:11,371
You can just dye your hair again

474
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,050
I've had enough of you, Howl!

475
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:27,387
I've never once been beautiful!

476
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:30,931
I've had enough of this place!

477
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:14,099
Thank you, Turnip
You're a kind Scarecrow

478
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,103
Please come back, Sophie
Howl's in trouble!

479
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,648
Cut it out, Howl
I'm going out

480
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:23,108
Sophie!

481
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,527
Get over here

482
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,072
My, he's dramatic

483
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,365
Is he dead?

484
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,619
Don't worry
A tantrum never killed anyone

485
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,038
Help me, Markl

486
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,668
Get that hot water running, Markl

487
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:45,005
C'mon, you can still walk

488
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:58,353
You look after him now, Markl

489
00:48:58,353 --> 00:48:59,603
Sure

490
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,148
I'll have to clean all over again

491
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:27,965
I'm coming in

492
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,934
Here's some hot milk
Drink up

493
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:45,900
I'll leave it here
Drink it while it's hot

494
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,405
Don't leave me, Sophie

495
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,081
Try a little milk?

496
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,262
The Witch of the Waste
is searching for my house

497
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:19,057
You're right, I saw her cronies
down at the port

498
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,893
The truth is, I'm a coward

499
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,565
All this junk is just sorcery
to keep her away

500
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,775
I'm scared to death

501
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:32,780
Tell me, why is
the Witch of the Waste after you?

502
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:37,326
She seemed quite interesting,
so I approached her

503
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:41,289
But she terrified me
and I ran away

504
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,170
Now the king's ordered
me to report to him

505
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:50,172
As Jenkins and as Pendragon...

506
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,507
How many names do you use, Howl?

507
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:55,260
Enough to guarantee my freedom

508
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,597
Can't you refuse the king?

509
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,141
See that...

510
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:04,896
The oath I took at
the Sorcery Academy

511
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,775
Say, Howl
Why not visit the king?

512
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,110
What!

513
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,737
Just say it to his face

514
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:17,617
“Stop this foolish war
I refuse to help you”

515
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:22,496
Sophie, you don't know
what they're like

516
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:28,126
But he's the king, right? A king thinks
only of what's best for his people

517
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,128
I know!

518
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,465
You'll go in my place, Sophie!

519
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:36,677
Pretend you're Pendragon's mother

520
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:40,472
Just tell him your son is
an idle good-for-nothing

521
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,476
Maybe Madam Suliman
will even give up on me

522
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,811
Madam Suliman?

523
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,108
You're wearing that hat?

524
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,485
After all the magic I spent
making your dress pretty...

525
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,570
Off I go

526
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,655
Sure

527
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,614
See you later!

528
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:08,668
This charm
assures your safe return

529
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:13,547
Don't worry, I'll follow you in disguise

530
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,340
There
Off you go!

531
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:26,184
I'm sure this will never work

532
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,364
I don't suppose he's following me,
disguised as a crow

533
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:47,539
I'm sure Howl would pick
a more dramatic disguise

534
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,213
Not that...

535
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,561
The Palace is so far away

536
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:54,440
Howl?
Don't tell me you're Howl

537
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,822
Disguising yourself as an old dog,
of all things

538
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,617
Do you know how exhausting
it is to be old?

539
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:11,998
How nice to see you
The little hatter, right?

540
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,960
The Witch of the Waste!

541
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,128
Thank you so much for
delivering my note to Howl

542
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,592
How's Howl doing?

543
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,469
Quite terrified

544
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:27,056
Thanks to you,
I've become a cleaning lady

545
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,976
My how delightful

546
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:34,230
By the way, what brings you
to see the king?

547
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:37,817
Job hunting
I'm sick of working for Howl

548
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:38,985
And yourself?

549
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,945
The king invited me

550
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,992
It seems that idiot, Suliman,
finally needs my power

551
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,621
Why don't you break the spell
you put on me

552
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,539
That's impossible

553
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:56,751
My gifts lie in casting spells,
not breaking them

554
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,297
See you later, then

555
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:03,175
Hey, wait a minute
Just wait!

556
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:07,012
If you weren't here,
I'd have hit her with my cane

557
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:26,489
What's wrong with you?

558
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,994
Madam, vehicles are prohibited
beyond this point

559
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,704
Please continue on foot

560
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,371
That Suliman

561
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:37,208
Using magic to force me
to climb these stairs

562
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:51,097
We'll catch up
Pay her no mind

563
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:19,293
Heavy, why are you so heavy?

564
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:33,099
You... Hey... Wait

565
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:34,934
What is it?

566
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:39,105
Suddenly remembered...
how to break my spell?

567
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:42,690
I told you...

568
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,110
I don't know how

569
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,277
Then, start studying up

570
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,202
I don't get it

571
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:56,414
Where does she get all that energy?

572
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:06,507
I have to put you down

573
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:16,641
Why don't you call it a day?
You can't make it

574
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:22,148
It's been 50 years now,
since they drove me out of here...

575
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:27,445
I've been longing for this day...
Ever since

576
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:28,987
Good luck to you, then

577
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,532
Still, I'm not nice enough
to help you out

578
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,367
Come, Howl

579
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,954
You heartless wench

580
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,666
Next time I'll turn you feeble, too

581
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,688
Hurry up!

582
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,567
Madam, follow me

583
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,070
First, you should help her

584
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,864
We are forbidden to assist anyone

585
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:16,202
But the king himself invited her

586
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,996
Hang in there!

587
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,539
Just a little farther

588
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,751
And you call yourself a witch?

589
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,838
Who asked you?

590
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,510
You suddenly look older

591
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:36,679
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

592
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,766
Pull yourself together

593
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,018
Isn't this what you've been waiting for?

594
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:48,817
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

595
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:53,030
Pendragon...
That name sounds familiar

596
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:56,742
Of course it does
That was the name of my hat shop

597
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:57,952
It was?

598
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,246
Please wait here

599
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,878
A chair!

600
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,838
It's mine!

601
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,726
Howl, get back here

602
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,487
Madam, this way please

603
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,007
I understand you're Howl's mother

604
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,010
Yes
My name is Pendragon

605
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,014
I'm sure you're weary
Please have a seat

606
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:43,514
Yes

607
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:56,987
I am Madam Suliman, His Majesty's witch

608
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:04,536
Um, that dog is...

609
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,454
Ah, you mean Heen?

610
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:10,376
He does my errands
I asked him to escort you

611
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:16,882
Howl won't join us, then?

612
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:21,427
You see, he sends his mother
to make excuses

613
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:24,389
I'm sure he'd be utterly useless
to His Majesty

614
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,726
What a shame

615
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,230
He was my lest apprentice...

616
01:01:32,398 --> 01:01:35,733
A student of such marvelous gifts

617
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:39,780
I rejoiced in finally finding
a worthy heir

618
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:45,369
But then, a demon stole his heart,

619
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:47,413
and he abandoned me

620
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:51,750
He turned his magic
to purely selfish uses

621
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,628
Mrs. Pendragon

622
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:57,922
That boy is dangerous

623
01:01:57,922 --> 01:02:01,885
His power is too great
for one with no heart

624
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:07,682
If he follows that path he'll wind up
like the Witch of the Waste

625
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,391
Bring her

626
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,608
What happened?

627
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,572
I just restored her to her real age

628
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,574
All her powers are gone

629
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:28,077
Once upon a time,
she was a magnificent witch

630
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:31,331
She made a bargain with a demon

631
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:34,668
who consumed her, body and soul,
long, long ago

632
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:38,672
Our kingdom can no longer afford
to turn a blind eye

633
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,507
to disreputable wizards and witches

634
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:44,344
If Howl comes here
to serve the kingdom,

635
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,306
I will teach him how to break
with the demon

636
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:51,601
If hot, I'll strip him of his powers
as I have taken hers

637
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,811
Now just a minute

638
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:58,442
Now I understand why Howl
refused to come here

639
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,485
Something's not right

640
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:04,947
Forcing your aged guests to climb
stairs, dragging them into strange rooms

641
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,324
It's like a trap

642
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:08,659
You call Howl heartless!

643
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:12,831
Yes, he's selfish and cowardly
and unpredictable

644
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:16,335
But he's straight as an arrow
He only wants to be free

645
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,338
Howl won't turn into an evil monster

646
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:22,173
He'll battle the demon on his own

647
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,342
I believe in him

648
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,637
Mrs. Pendragon...
You're in love with Howl

649
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:31,516
Howl...
Howl's coming?

650
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,811
I want Howl's heart, I want it

651
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:38,690
That's enough from you
Howl's not coming

652
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,318
Howl will most certainly come

653
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:45,864
Now, I've found his weakness

654
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:53,704
Your Majesty

655
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,164
As you are

656
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,041
How are you feeling?

657
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,418
Thank you for asking

658
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:01,880
Meetings bore me
I flew out for e breather

659
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:03,882
How lovely

660
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,132
These are?

661
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,219
This is Wizard Howl's mother

662
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,387
I see

663
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:18,063
I appreciate it, but I don't intend
to win any war with magic

664
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:23,068
It's true that Suliman's powers
shield our palace from bombs

665
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:25,945
But they just fall on neighboring towns

666
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,614
That's how magic works
Right, Suliman?

667
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:31,076
Such eloquence today, Your Majesty

668
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:32,577
Suliman!

669
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:39,543
This is the final battle
This time, we'll beat them to a pulp

670
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:46,717
Suliman, you've outdone yourself
with that double. Await good news

671
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:48,092
Thank you kindly

672
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,596
Have my generals assembled?

673
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:57,143
It's been awhile, Howl

674
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,563
Delighted to see you doing so well

675
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:01,981
I saw right through you

676
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,942
I've kept my oath

677
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,945
I've no wish to fight you

678
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,447
I'll take my mother

679
01:05:08,447 --> 01:05:10,114
I won't let you go

680
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:34,014
Don't look down,
you'll be dragged down

681
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:37,516
It's time I showed your mother
what you really are

682
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,532
Howl, don't! It's a trap

683
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:48,880
Hold tight

684
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,389
Sophie, sit up front

685
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,811
Oh, ho, Sophie,
you brought the whole gang along

686
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:06,690
Nice doggie

687
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:10,152
You're just Suliman's spy

688
01:07:10,402 --> 01:07:13,070
Oh, well, too late to toss you now

689
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,905
Sophie, you steer

690
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:17,409
What! I can't possibly!

691
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:18,659
They're after us

692
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:27,335
I'll tackle them. Fly straight
to the castle in the Wastes

693
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:29,378
What! That's impossible!

694
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:32,548
Don't worry, the ring will guide you

695
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,925
Summon Calcifer with your heart

696
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:36,510
Summon Calcifer?

697
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:40,806
It's glowing

698
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:45,436
Follow the light
You'll be there by nightfall

699
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:48,940
Why send me to Suliman
if you were coming yourself?

700
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,568
Your presence gave me
the courage for it

701
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:54,070
She's too terrible to
face on my own

702
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:58,657
You've saved me
I was in grave danger back there

703
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:01,619
Don't let go!

704
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,503
- You're good
- Stop joking!

705
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,673
We've got a lead now

706
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:17,844
I can give you 5 minutes of invisibility,
now's your chance

707
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,849
HOWL!

708
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:36,947
No, thank you

709
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:40,867
Thank you. That's the most fun
I've had in ages

710
01:08:41,243 --> 01:08:43,787
I supposed Howl thinks
he's escaped...

711
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:47,373
His mother's awfully young

712
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,510
We're not far
That's my hometown

713
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,391
Don't look so friendly
I don't trust you

714
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:13,376
The castle
They've come to meet us

715
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,382
Sophie!

716
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:22,135
Markl, help!

717
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:24,386
I don't know how to stop this thing!

718
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,234
Sophie!

719
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:40,278
Doggie

720
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:43,657
Markl

721
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:45,951
I'm home

722
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,244
Sophie, are you hurt?

723
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:50,287
You're home!

724
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:52,873
Thank you for coming to meet us

725
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:26,490
Oh, no, you've gone too far

726
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:47,177
I wonder if Howl's back

727
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:42,900
Howl?

728
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:47,131
Howl? Is it you?

729
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:52,470
Are you hurt? In pain?

730
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:55,640
Stay away

731
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,559
I want to help you

732
01:13:57,809 --> 01:13:59,810
I want to break the spell you're under

733
01:14:00,979 --> 01:14:04,314
You can't even break your own spell

734
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:06,818
But I love you!

735
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,028
Too late

736
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,492
HOWL!

737
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,340
Howl must be back

738
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:33,845
Sophie, you'd better figure out
how to break my spell quick

739
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:36,597
We're both running out of time

740
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:39,516
Meaning Howl will turn into
a monster? Is it true?

741
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:43,061
I can't tell you that
I'm a demon

742
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:47,274
Calcifer, Suliman told me,

743
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:50,360
Howl has given you
something very precious

744
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,363
What is it?
Where is it?

745
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:55,283
That's confidential information

746
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:57,952
And if I threaten
to dump water over you?

747
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:00,704
How dare you!
Howl will die with me

748
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:22,185
Good morning, Turnip

749
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:23,770
We've got to be brave

750
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,775
Ready, Sophie!

751
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:33,112
OK! Open wider, Calcifer

752
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:37,367
Here goes! Push!

753
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:39,077
Heave!

754
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:51,256
I... said... move!

755
01:15:51,838 --> 01:15:53,257
Come on!

756
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:18,615
They call it a castle, but once
you get inside, it's a junk heap

757
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:23,621
It's time to eat!

758
01:16:29,836 --> 01:16:31,587
Here, old girl

759
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:35,341
But, Sophie
she's the Witch of the Waste

760
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,301
No need to worry

761
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:39,470
Why's she staring at me?

762
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,055
Such a pretty fire

763
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:45,935
Howl

764
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:47,270
Hello, everyone

765
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,354
Welcome home

766
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,523
Master Howl,
can we keep this puppy?

767
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:54,152
An old Witch and
Madam Suliman's dog

768
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:56,529
VVhy'd you let them in, Calcifer?

769
01:16:56,988 --> 01:17:00,824
Don't look at me!
They blew in with Sophie

770
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,329
Sophie, always dramatic...

771
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:08,416
So you're Turnip

772
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:13,003
You're under quite a spell, too

773
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:16,173
Seems everyone in our little family
is complicated...

774
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:18,384
He's so handsome

775
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:22,220
This is a busy day
We're moving

776
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,305
Moving?

777
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:26,559
Oh, good. There aren't any shops,
here in the middle of nowhere

778
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:30,438
Madam Suliman can track us down
in no time, here

779
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:34,859
But you'll have to stay behind
The magic in your spell's too risky

780
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,533
All right, that's done

781
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:45,328
Take it away, Calcifer

782
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,011
Excehent

783
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,680
Stay right where you are

784
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,018
Be gentle...

785
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,689
Here goes

786
01:18:58,109 --> 01:19:00,610
We've moved
You can get up now

787
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:05,408
Amazing, Master
It's so grand

788
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:08,618
What a pretty fire

789
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:23,801
This is...

790
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,805
I added a bathroom
For our growing family

791
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:31,184
Sophie, come here!
Sophie!

792
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:37,481
I added a bedroom, too
Go in

793
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,659
This is... why?

794
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:53,122
I thought it would suit you
Do you like it?

795
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:57,627
Yes, it's perfect
for a housekeeper

796
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,005
I got you new clothes, too
Open them later. Next

797
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:04,550
Sophie! Come here!
Quick!

798
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:06,969
A courtyard!

799
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:08,512
There's a shop, too

800
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,847
Let's go, Heen!

801
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:14,435
See that new color on the dial?
There's a new exit

802
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:20,858
My gift to you, Sophie
Step outside

803
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:47,926
It's my secret garden

804
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,304
Beautiful

805
01:20:52,472 --> 01:20:54,684
Did you make it with your magic?

806
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:57,854
Only a little, to help the flowers

807
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,407
Thank you, Howl!

808
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,408
It's like I'm dreaming

809
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:35,600
Sophie

810
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:41,021
How mysterious
I feel I've been here before

811
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:43,440
I could cry with happiness

812
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,692
Come

813
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,284
Look

814
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:01,207
A sweet little house

815
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,461
My favorite hideaway

816
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:07,422
When I was little I spent
my summers there alone

817
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,426
Alone?

818
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:15,055
My Uncle, the Wizard,
left it to me in secret

819
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,891
Make yourself at home there, Sophie

820
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:22,771
What's wrong?

821
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:24,523
I'm scared

822
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:27,652
I'm afraid you'll go off and disappear
somewhere, once I'm inside

823
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,657
Howl, tell me the truth

824
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:35,659
I don't mind if you're a monster

825
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:44,877
I want to make sure that
you'll all live comfortably

826
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:49,172
Why not a flower shop,
with all these flowers?

827
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:52,176
You'd be good at it, Sophie

828
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:54,345
And then, you'd go away?

829
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:59,057
I want to help you, Howl

830
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:03,395
I'm not beautiful
and I'm only good at cleaning...

831
01:23:03,813 --> 01:23:06,439
Sophie, you are beautiful

832
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:14,198
The good thing about being old
is that you've so little to lose...

833
01:23:27,795 --> 01:23:29,796
Why's that flying here?

834
01:23:29,796 --> 01:23:30,756
A battleship?

835
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,341
On its way to burn cities and people

836
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:33,967
The enemy's'? Ours?

837
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:36,052
What difference does it make?

838
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:49,859
Murderers

839
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,202
Look at all those bombs

840
01:24:16,135 --> 01:24:17,552
It stopped

841
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:18,804
Did you do that?

842
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:21,806
I'm just tinkering
It won't crash

843
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:26,353
HOWL!

844
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,980
Oops, looks like they're onto us

845
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:41,786
Madam Suliman's deputies
Let's go back

846
01:24:41,786 --> 01:24:43,787
Run! Move those legs

847
01:24:58,219 --> 01:24:59,595
Hurry on in!

848
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,221
No! Don't let go!

849
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:12,524
What happened, Sophie?

850
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,485
I've had it with this place!

851
01:25:25,328 --> 01:25:26,913
Good night, Sophie

852
01:25:27,206 --> 01:25:28,623
Good night

853
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:35,131
Don't worry about Master Howl, Sophie
Sometimes, he's gone for days on end

854
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:37,632
Thank you, Markl

855
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:38,967
Need the toilet?

856
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,511
I'm fine

857
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:42,179
Good night

858
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:43,721
You're in love

859
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,020
Sighing away like that

860
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,576
I thought so

861
01:26:03,576 --> 01:26:06,119
Were you ever in love?

862
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:09,081
Of course I was
I'm still in love

863
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,207
What?

864
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:13,543
Men, why ever should we went them...

865
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:16,212
But a young man's heart is so delicious!

866
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,215
Unbelievable

867
01:26:18,631 --> 01:26:20,801
And so adorable, too

868
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:25,930
What is that?

869
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:27,557
Air raid siren

870
01:26:28,559 --> 01:26:29,435
Air raid?

871
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:34,939
It's not for here
But best not go out tonight

872
01:26:36,442 --> 01:26:41,070
Suliman's creatures are searching
high and low for our house

873
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:48,078
What a good fire,
hiding us so well

874
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:25,783
Sophie, a stranger got in!

875
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:34,332
Mother

876
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:36,793
Sophie!

877
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:42,091
Where have you been!
I searched for you everywhere!

878
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:45,094
But, oh, look how you've aged!

879
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:47,512
It's all my fault

880
01:27:49,472 --> 01:27:52,059
I'm so sorry, Sophie!

881
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:54,185
Mother...

882
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,815
I barely recognize the house

883
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:00,484
Who is that?

884
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:02,653
Oh, your landlady

885
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:06,323
Sophie, I've got a new husband!

886
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,493
He's such a wonderful man
And he's rich, too!

887
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:11,161
We can all live together again

888
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:13,956
You'll never have to clean again

889
01:28:14,497 --> 01:28:17,333
But I'm happy here...

890
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,336
Really?

891
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:20,628
Oops, I forgot

892
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:23,047
My car's waiting
I've got to run

893
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:31,180
I'm so glad I found you again

894
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,350
We'll really catch up next time

895
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:35,644
In the meantime, you take care

896
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:45,154
A peeping-bug, eh?
The oldest trick in the book, Suliman

897
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:47,030
All yours, Cal

898
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:59,042
May you find happiness, Mother

899
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,337
Thank you
You too, Sophie

900
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:08,594
I've done what I was told
Take me back to my husband

901
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:11,930
Yes, I'm sure Madam Suliman
will be pleased

902
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:15,934
Forgive me, Sophie...

903
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,398
Look at all these people

904
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:25,444
They're all running away
The town will be empty

905
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:27,237
Do you wish to run, too?

906
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,908
That's what that lady spoke of...

907
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:34,703
So, she did
I'm glad we made up

908
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,662
Don't go, Sophie!

909
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:40,917
I love you, Sophie
Please stay

910
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:45,588
I love you, too, Markl
Don't worry, I won't go

911
01:29:45,588 --> 01:29:46,756
Really!

912
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,592
Are we a family?

913
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:51,427
Yes, we're family

914
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:53,055
Oh, good!

915
01:30:01,604 --> 01:30:04,274
I'll never let Suliman
get hold of Howl

916
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:23,502
But the paper says we won

917
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:26,337
Only fools swallow such lies

918
01:30:27,381 --> 01:30:31,009
How strange
I can't get Calcifer going

919
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:33,636
Grandma, will you stop that?

920
01:30:33,636 --> 01:30:35,305
Such an awful stink

921
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:38,307
Why deny an old lady her pleasures

922
01:30:38,891 --> 01:30:40,476
Open the window, Markl

923
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:46,984
I wouldn't open that now...

924
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:53,323
In Calcifer's present state,
he can't possibly keep them out

925
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,409
Markl!

926
01:31:07,171 --> 01:31:08,505
Close it quick!

927
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,680
Look after Grandma, Markl
I'll check on the shop

928
01:31:36,492 --> 01:31:40,244
How dare you, now? If you've
energy to spare, put out the fires

929
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:05,895
HOWL!

930
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:21,078
Dramatic as usual...

931
01:32:34,423 --> 01:32:35,259
HOWL!

932
01:32:37,426 --> 01:32:39,805
I'm sorry
I had too many enemies, tonight

933
01:32:40,596 --> 01:32:43,475
Howl, oh, Howl

934
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:02,368
Master Howl!
Sophie!

935
01:33:05,122 --> 01:33:08,250
Calcifer, be strong

936
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:17,091
Madam, was that a gift
from Suliman?

937
01:33:17,551 --> 01:33:20,636
That granny fed me something nasty

938
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:23,640
Why, if it isn't HOWL

939
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:27,853
I feel we need a nice long chat

940
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:32,231
Likewise, Madam
But we've no time, now

941
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:37,069
How unlike you
You're not running away

942
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:38,572
Until later, then

943
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:42,826
Stay here, Sophie
Calcifer will protect you

944
01:33:42,826 --> 01:33:44,619
I'll see to things outside

945
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:47,831
Wait, Howl!

946
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:50,207
Don't go! Please stay

947
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:54,378
Another round of bombs is coming
Even Calcifer can't stop those

948
01:33:54,755 --> 01:33:56,715
Let's run away
Don't fight

949
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,717
I'm through running away

950
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:03,055
I've finally found someone
I want to protect...

951
01:34:03,512 --> 01:34:04,765
You

952
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:10,561
HOWL!

953
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:36,605
That's our town

954
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:42,404
There's Howl

955
01:35:51,787 --> 01:35:52,831
HOWL!

956
01:36:02,798 --> 01:36:04,676
Sophie!
Turnip...

957
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:10,265
Markl, come inside!

958
01:36:10,474 --> 01:36:13,601
Move? You're nuts
There's nothing there

959
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:16,979
No, as long as we stay here,
Howl will keep fighting

960
01:36:17,314 --> 01:36:18,856
He's better off a coward

961
01:36:19,064 --> 01:36:20,484
Grandma, get up

962
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,319
Going for a stroll?

963
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:24,695
Suliman will find us, right away

964
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:28,492
She already has. At this rate,
Howl will never make it back alive

965
01:36:28,492 --> 01:36:29,826
Sophie!

966
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:31,368
The castle's falling apart

967
01:36:31,368 --> 01:36:33,579
That's all right
Markl, take Grandma

968
01:36:33,579 --> 01:36:34,581
Sure

969
01:36:36,832 --> 01:36:38,335
You, too, hop up now

970
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:42,338
I can't! My contract says
I can't leave the fireplace

971
01:36:42,756 --> 01:36:45,341
If you two can't solve this,
I'll do it for you

972
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:47,301
Watch it!

973
01:36:47,551 --> 01:36:49,679
Cut it out! Cut it out!

974
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,974
If I leave, the house will collapse

975
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:53,850
Fine!

976
01:36:57,729 --> 01:36:59,271
We're out

977
01:36:59,271 --> 01:37:01,358
I'd better go last

978
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:05,694
Even I don't know what'll happen...

979
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:36,893
I told you, it would collapse

980
01:37:36,893 --> 01:37:38,228
Rain!

981
01:37:40,814 --> 01:37:42,481
Is that heading for town?

982
01:37:42,481 --> 01:37:44,192
Look after Grandma, Markl

983
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,110
Turnip, find us a way in

984
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:49,573
Don't worry, Grandma
I'll take care of you

985
01:37:52,449 --> 01:37:54,661
Markl, we can get in here

986
01:38:04,421 --> 01:38:07,090
The roof's leaking
I'll go out

987
01:38:07,506 --> 01:38:08,884
Wait here

988
01:38:08,884 --> 01:38:10,217
It's wet here...

989
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:18,350
Hurry

990
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,146
Too damp

991
01:38:25,774 --> 01:38:27,610
Bring Grandma here, Markl

992
01:38:27,903 --> 01:38:29,570
The castle's empty

993
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:33,408
I told you, if we'd stayed put,
Howl and I could've handled it

994
01:38:35,784 --> 01:38:38,454
Calcifer, please
You're my last hope

995
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:41,625
I want to go to Howl
Move the castle

996
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:46,587
I know you can do it
You're so strong

997
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:49,798
But there's no chimney here...

998
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:51,926
And the wood's damp...

999
01:38:52,594 --> 01:38:56,972
As the saying goes, “The best
blaze brightest in adversity”

1000
01:38:56,972 --> 01:38:59,309
I've heard that, but...

1001
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:01,101
You really think so?

1002
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:03,229
You're so pretty, Cal

1003
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:04,480
Sit here, Grandma

1004
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:07,734
Then, give me something of yours,
Sophie

1005
01:39:07,734 --> 01:39:08,777
Of mine?

1006
01:39:08,777 --> 01:39:11,488
I can't do it alone
How about your eyes?

1007
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,822
My eyes?

1008
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:13,907
This?

1009
01:40:19,722 --> 01:40:22,434
Amazing, Calcifer!
You are the best!

1010
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:25,936
Imagine what I could do with
your eyes and your heart

1011
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:28,898
Heart! You have a heart?

1012
01:40:31,693 --> 01:40:33,403
Oh, my!

1013
01:40:45,748 --> 01:40:48,292
There's Howl
He's trapped

1014
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:55,425
Hurry, Calcifer!

1015
01:40:56,009 --> 01:40:57,426
Don't!

1016
01:40:58,219 --> 01:40:59,304
Grandma!

1017
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:01,221
Stop it!

1018
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:04,016
Howl's heart

1019
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:06,935
Cut it out!

1020
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:17,113
Grandma!

1021
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:21,158
It's hot, hot!

1022
01:41:21,618 --> 01:41:22,952
Let go!

1023
01:41:23,453 --> 01:41:24,996
You'll die, Grandma

1024
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:27,289
No, it's mine!

1025
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:47,060
Sophie!

1026
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:52,023
Sophie!

1027
01:41:52,731 --> 01:41:56,069
She's so mean
That's mine

1028
01:42:39,319 --> 01:42:42,990
Oh, no, Heen, look what I've done
I poured water on Calcifer

1029
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:48,872
What if I've killed Howl, too...

1030
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:17,774
It's moving...
Is Howl alive?

1031
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:19,652
Show me where he is

1032
01:43:41,841 --> 01:43:43,259
The castle door...

1033
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:02,671
Heen...

1034
01:45:38,248 --> 01:45:39,207
Howl...

1035
01:45:57,851 --> 01:46:00,395
This must be Howl's childhood...

1036
01:47:19,434 --> 01:47:21,310
Howl!
Calcifer!

1037
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:26,940
It's Sophie! Wait for me!
I promise I'll come back for you

1038
01:47:28,443 --> 01:47:30,444
Wait for me in the future!

1039
01:48:03,435 --> 01:48:06,104
I'll walk there
Heen, I'll walk

1040
01:48:06,771 --> 01:48:08,483
I can't stop crying

1041
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:33,882
Howl

1042
01:48:40,722 --> 01:48:43,350
I'm sorry I took so long

1043
01:48:43,893 --> 01:48:46,186
You've been waiting all this time

1044
01:48:51,149 --> 01:48:53,903
Take me to Calcifer

1045
01:49:56,881 --> 01:49:57,966
Is he dead?

1046
01:49:57,966 --> 01:49:59,467
No, he's fine

1047
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:05,515
Grandma...

1048
01:50:05,515 --> 01:50:08,769
Don't look at me
I don't have anything

1049
01:50:09,645 --> 01:50:10,645
Please

1050
01:50:13,064 --> 01:50:14,524
Grandma

1051
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:19,988
You want it that badly?

1052
01:50:19,988 --> 01:50:21,157
Yes

1053
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:25,578
Oh, well, in that case...
You'd better take good care of it

1054
01:50:26,494 --> 01:50:27,704
There

1055
01:50:29,164 --> 01:50:31,333
Thank you, Grandma

1056
01:50:47,515 --> 01:50:49,018
Calcifer

1057
01:50:50,185 --> 01:50:53,021
Sophie...
I'm all worn out

1058
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:56,192
If I give Howl's heart back,
will it kill you?

1059
01:50:56,524 --> 01:50:59,069
Probably not, if you do it, Sophie

1060
01:50:59,779 --> 01:51:04,033
After all, we both survived
the water you dumped on me

1061
01:51:04,033 --> 01:51:05,618
I'd better try, then

1062
01:51:08,912 --> 01:51:12,332
It's all warm and fluttery
like a little bird

1063
01:51:12,332 --> 01:51:14,585
It's still only a child's heart

1064
01:51:15,543 --> 01:51:18,713
May Calcifer live a thousand years,

1065
01:51:18,713 --> 01:51:21,759
and may Howl recover his heart...

1066
01:51:33,479 --> 01:51:34,604
I'm alive!

1067
01:51:34,604 --> 01:51:36,273
I'm free!

1068
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:44,489
He moved, he's alive!

1069
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:51,079
You broke Calcifer's spell!

1070
01:52:05,927 --> 01:52:06,929
Turnip!

1071
01:52:19,942 --> 01:52:21,484
Turnip, are you OK?

1072
01:52:21,484 --> 01:52:23,445
I'll get you a new stick, right away

1073
01:52:26,073 --> 01:52:27,615
Thank you, Turnip

1074
01:52:36,082 --> 01:52:37,626
Thank you, Sophie

1075
01:52:38,752 --> 01:52:40,962
I'm a prince from the next kingdom

1076
01:52:40,962 --> 01:52:43,466
A cruel spell turned me
into a Scarecrow

1077
01:52:43,466 --> 01:52:44,507
A spell that only your beloved's
kiss could break

1078
01:52:44,507 --> 01:52:46,719
“beyond these fears ” A spell that
only your beloved's kiss could break

1079
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:46,844
“beyond these fears ”

1080
01:52:46,844 --> 01:52:49,889
“beyond these fears ” Exactly.
And if Sophie hadn't saved me, I would have died

1081
01:52:49,889 --> 01:52:51,515
Exactly. And if Sophie hadn't saved me,
I would have died

1082
01:52:51,806 --> 01:52:54,100
“my flickering smile”
My, you're good-looking

1083
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:54,268
“my flickering smile”

1084
01:52:54,268 --> 01:52:56,979
“my flickering smile” What
a racket What's the fuss?

1085
01:52:57,854 --> 01:52:58,564
I feel terrible
Like I'm trapped under a stone

1086
01:52:58,564 --> 01:53:00,315
“holds the promise of love”
I feel terrible
Like I'm trapped under a stone

1087
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:00,690
“holds the promise of love”

1088
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:03,027
“holds the promise of love”
Oh, yes, a heart's a heavy burden

1089
01:53:03,402 --> 01:53:05,488
Oh, Sophie, your hair is
