given the circumstances.

- Yes... Why?

Because you think you talking to say?

497

I've never cheated on my wife.
I'm not in love quickly.

498
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:32,074
I do not want love. We see

- I would like to give it a chance, Ann.

If you are not silent,
I say mean things.

You can only hurt

I will never hurt you, Ann.

505

But I am talking not about you.
You know me.

- I'm a whore, Chris. Okay?

That is what I am. A whore.

mispeuterd what, huh, pal?

Why does your wife
separate from you?

Separation has been said.
We're just a little while apart.

517

- Why?
- My wife has found out something...

I hope my wife forgives me quickly,
because I see her happy.

526
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,036
Cheating is all nothing,
it is true, eh.

527
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,638
- Have you been with her to the loft?
- No, that's happened in Düsseldorf.

528

- In Düsseldorf?
- Why were you there?

529
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,513
There was a lounge building.
Vince had a few vipkaarten

in a chic hotel, away from home.

- You drive people away with your nonsense.

1307
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:28,713
I must leave. I have children
this weekend. I have many plans.

1308
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,751
Leave me alone with my wife?

1309
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,555
- You drink something there?
- We will drink a lot.

1310
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:42,994
[SQUEALING TIRES]

1311
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:56,519
ANN: Chris?

1312
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,595
Day, Ann.

1313
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:06,436
- Long ago.
- Yes.

1314
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:12,397
I still have a key
that I have to give back.

1315
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:16,195
I do not think that still fits.
Vincent lives there now.

1316
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:19,233
That is all he
should love his wife.

1317
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:25,632
- And what about your brother?
- The case is next month.

1318
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,512
We'll see, huh.

1319
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,193
- And you? Everything okay?
- Yes.

1320
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,960
- Most of the time.
- Most of the time...

1321
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,633
Yes...

1322
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:43,875
I made you hard.
And I'm sorry. Really.

1323
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:51,110
You can only hurt
by those who see you happy.

1324
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:55,679
- I learned from you.
- I do not know whether I still believe.

1325
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:57,472
You get lost by many.

1326
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:00,189
Yes.

1327
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:04,195
I have changed.

1328
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,713
You even changed jobs,
I've heard.

1329
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:12,793
- So you follow me a little?
- A little, yes.

1330
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,035
A little...

1331
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:23,716
You may want to me a little
to follow for a cup of coffee or something?

1332
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:29,232
I am changed, Ann.

1333
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,279
Ok.

1334
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,438
But...

1335
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:48,431
I still drink coffee.
