1
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:05,737
- Is he here yet?
- No.

2
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:10,008
- You scared him.
- I gotta take a massive piss.

3
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:13,779
Dude, any excuse for you to pull that thing out.

4
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:31,032
Anyone got any beer?

5
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:36,267
We finished them all back at school.
Besides, you've had enough.

6
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,346
I've got one. It's not cold,
but it's yours if you want it.

7
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,986
All you gotta do is sit up, beg,
roll over and shake that booty.

8
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:47,849
- Thanks a lot, Eric.
- Anytime, anywhere.

9
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:51,992
- This is gonna be sweet.
- I'm glad I thought of it.

10
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:54,754
You're animals.
Just because he's new.

11
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:58,797
You've talked shit the whole time.
Why don't you be quiet?

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,198
You know how it is.
Nobody's forcing him to show up.

13
00:02:04,673 --> 00:02:07,938
What if he doesn't?
I want to go back to the dance.

14
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:12,307
Belinda, why don't you go back to the dance by yourself?

15
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:15,706
I wasn't talking to you, Dean.

16
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,817
You know I don't dance.

17
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:21,682
It's true. I've seen him bust a move.
It ain't pretty.

18
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,190
But a brother like me is ready
to get his freak on. What you say?

19
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,761
Put it away before you hurt somebody.

20
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:31,364
Like yourself.

21
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:32,828
He's here!

22
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:35,628
All right, here he comes.

23
00:02:36,772 --> 00:02:39,798
Hey, check out the Safari Joe truck.

24
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:43,375
I can't wait to see you fly!

25
00:02:49,384 --> 00:02:51,909
Hey, nice shirt, Opie.

26
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,220
You're late.

27
00:02:57,426 --> 00:03:01,089
I thought I said be here at 10, but you know...

28
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:06,199
When I say be here at 10, be here.
Can you remember that next time?

29
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,137
If there is a next time!

30
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,810
Dean! Is he always like that?

31
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:20,971
Always, man. So how about it?
You ready to fly?

32
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:23,708
Wait up, baby!

33
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,022
Let me get on your back.
Giddyap! Giddyap!

34
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:55,548
Okay, here's the deal.

35
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,345
You're gonna jump from up there into here.

36
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:02,148
That's it, and you're one of us. Okay?

37
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:04,587
- You ready?
- Yeah.

38
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:07,557
All right. All right.

39
00:04:08,263 --> 00:04:10,322
Let's do this, okay?

40
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:19,807
It's cake, man.
Hell, I'm jumping with you.

41
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:23,968
- How deep is this?
- I don't really know.

42
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:25,737
Let's go find out.

43
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:30,641
Let's do it.

44
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:01,245
Yeah! Shit, yeah!

45
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:05,879
Come on, let's go!

46
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:07,550
Jump!

47
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:13,085
- You done this?
- We've all done it.

48
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:18,426
- I hope you had your Wheaties!
- You guys gonna do this tonight?

49
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,533
On three.

50
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:22,759
One.

51
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:24,666
Two.

52
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:26,135
Three!

53
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,089
Oh, shit.

54
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,653
Landon, he's hurt!

55
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:50,160
- Is he okay?
- Landon, get down here!

56
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:52,629
- What the hell?
- Dean, what the hell?

57
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:55,200
- You guys, he's hurt!
- Come on, man!

58
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:59,863
- I told you it was a bad idea!
- Get him out of the water!

59
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:05,211
- Hurry up!
- Is he dead? What are we gonna do?

60
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:07,838
Help me!

61
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:14,250
- Get him over here!
- There's a pipe. He must have hit it!

62
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,524
Get him out of the water!

63
00:06:17,726 --> 00:06:20,456
Watch his head! Watch his head!

64
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:24,028
Hey, who's down there?

65
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:26,496
Tracie, come on!

66
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:31,402
Central, we've got trespassers.
Send a squad car.

67
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:33,597
Come on, Landon.

68
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:36,372
Come on!

69
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:38,603
You guys, just take him!

70
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:40,804
Give me his arms!

71
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,883
I got him.

72
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:48,687
We gotta get out of here.

73
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,624
- Go! Get out of here!
- Landon, come on!

74
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:58,493
I told you not to do this!

75
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,224
Calm down.

76
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:06,507
Belinda, let's go!

77
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:11,107
Come on, get in! I'm driving.

78
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:34,633
Damn it!

79
00:07:57,592 --> 00:07:58,957
Shit!

80
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,488
Put your hands on the wheel.

81
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:02,112
You know, Mama, my leg really hurts today.

82
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:05,019
I don't think I can go anyplace.

83
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:10,253
- Maybe I should call your father.
- No.

84
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:12,730
I'm not talking to him.

85
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:18,634
This has gotta stop between you two.
You can't do that. You need a father.

86
00:09:20,642 --> 00:09:25,238
Let us be thankful today
that a life was saved by our Lord.

87
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,782
And let us pray for the lives of the others involved...

88
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:33,818
...who are clearly not
on the path of righteousness.

89
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:16,346
- So how's the leg, man?
- It's good.

90
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:18,752
I can't believe you were in jail.

91
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,521
- What'd you tell them?
- It was a nice night for a drive.

92
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,131
Ended up at the cement factory, found Gephardt.

93
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,461
Tried to help him, got spooked.

94
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,128
Figured I'd leave before they thought I was involved.

95
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,674
Gotta hand it to you.
You're a Jedi Master of bullshit.

96
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:40,177
Damn, that Jamie Sullivan sure has style.

97
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:42,679
Wore that dress in the fourth grade.

98
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:45,444
It's the quiet ones you gotta watch.

99
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:48,645
She might put it on a brother
like a Pop-Tart.

100
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:52,383
A little maintenance, she might not look bad.

101
00:11:52,593 --> 00:11:54,356
Nice sweater.

102
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:56,427
Thank you.

103
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:05,568
Thank you.

104
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,485
A student claims you were drinking on school property.

105
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,352
Lucky for you, Clay Gephardt isn't talking.

106
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,520
The factory owners aren't pressing
charges. At least not today.

107
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:33,599
I said I'd arrange appropriate punishment.

108
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,792
What, are you gonna expel me?

109
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:37,737
Not yet.

110
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:44,236
Besides attending class, you will help
our janitorial staff after school.

111
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:47,903
- For pay?
- For the inner satisfaction it brings.

112
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:52,545
Saturdays, you'll tutor students at our sister school.

113
00:12:52,754 --> 00:12:56,019
You'll take part in the drama club's final event.

114
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:58,522
The spring play?

115
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:02,594
It's time you experienced other things.

116
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:06,699
Started spending time with other kinds of people.

117
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:09,027
Don't blow it, Landon.

118
00:13:14,642 --> 00:13:20,239
This is a device made of plastic wrap,
a coat hanger and Wite-Out.

119
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:24,248
- Does anyone know what it is?
- It's a star frame.

120
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,283
This is a star frame.

121
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,789
It will help you locate stars with your naked eye.

122
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:38,899
Mercury and Jupiter can be seen just
over the west horizon after sunset.

123
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,627
Bet you can see angels up there, flying around.

124
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:45,671
There are things that could be called miraculous.

125
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:50,537
The more Einstein studied the universe,
the more he believed in a higher power.

126
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:54,038
Well, if there is a higher power...

127
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:56,843
...why can't he get you a new sweater?

128
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:59,711
He's too busy looking for your brain.

129
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,055
Laugh, it's a joke.

130
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:06,988
- Let's get out of here.
- I gotta stay.

131
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:10,426
Principal's gone.
Let's make some moves.

132
00:14:10,865 --> 00:14:12,730
Come on. Come on.

133
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:16,563
I don't know.
The custodian thing kind of suits you.

134
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:19,831
Thanks, buddy. Thank you.

135
00:14:24,412 --> 00:14:27,381
Look at the chart, you'll see Halley's comet.

136
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:33,750
Okay, so I'll see you at school.

137
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:37,186
My parents aren't home, if you want to come inside.

138
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:41,727
Come on, Belinda. Nothing's changed.

139
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,990
I know. I just thought...

140
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,757
It's over.

141
00:14:47,735 --> 00:14:50,863
Yeah. Whatever.

142
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:03,080
Okay.

143
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:10,190
Good morning, Landon.

144
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:12,951
Landon, wake up!

145
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:15,994
Come on. Up, up, up, up!

146
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:18,728
Up!

147
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,833
It's Saturday, no school.

148
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,901
Tutoring.

149
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:44,617
Let's try this again.

150
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:49,122
Which of these are similar triangles?
This one or that one?

151
00:15:49,463 --> 00:15:51,328
What do you think?

152
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:54,394
Man, I think this is bullshit!

153
00:15:57,672 --> 00:15:59,902
Makes two of us.

154
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:25,956
Do you wanna buy some raffle tickets?

155
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:30,194
I'm trying to raise money to buy Jefferson new computers.

156
00:16:30,404 --> 00:16:32,167
No.

157
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:37,905
So I saw you in there with Luis.

158
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:40,703
And I know it can be difficult...

159
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:44,510
...but maybe you should back
into it from somewhere else.

160
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:52,251
Are you gonna go visit Clay Gephardt?

161
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:57,726
That would be a no.

162
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,501
They moved him from the hospital to a rehab place.

163
00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:05,604
Is this your idea of small talk?

164
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:09,572
If so, your social skills need work.
No one made him jump.

165
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,574
- It's called peer pressure.
- How do you know?

166
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,044
You read it in your precious book?

167
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,112
Please don't pretend like you know me, okay?

168
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:26,259
But I do. I do.

169
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,759
We have all the same classes since kindergarten.

170
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:33,798
Why, you're Jamie Sullivan.
You sit at lunch table seven.

171
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:38,768
It's not the reject table, but it's
definitely self-exile territory.

172
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:43,569
You have exactly one sweater.
You look at your feet when you walk.

173
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:46,303
And for fun, you tutor on weekends...

174
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:49,210
...and hang out
with the Stars and Planets kids.

175
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:50,975
How's that sound?

176
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:56,955
Fairly predictable.
Nothing I haven't heard before.

177
00:17:57,158 --> 00:18:01,390
- You don't care what people think?
- No.

178
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:34,122
I don't know what your problem is.
Miss Garber has nice hooters.

179
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:37,957
This is bullshit. Thanks.

180
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:42,363
I can't wait to see you in stage
makeup. That's gonna be cool.

181
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,336
- Be back in an hour.
- Tell them to do West Side Story.

182
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:52,672
Get that nice big-booty girl
from Selena. Maria! Maria!

183
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,011
This year's spring musical is about
fiery passion and blazing Tommy guns.

184
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:03,521
Written by our own Eddie Zimmerhoff.
Words and music by Jamie Sullivan.

185
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:09,319
It tells the story of Tommy "The Gun"
Thornton in Prohibition-era New York.

186
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,963
Eddie, perhaps...

187
00:19:11,165 --> 00:19:14,726
Mr. Carter, better late than never.
Please join us.

188
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:16,698
Sure.

189
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,064
Now then, let's see...

190
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:27,006
Jamie will be our Alicia, a mysterious club singer.

191
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:31,242
- Sally will be playing Caroline.
- Congratulations.

192
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:34,615
And Landon will read Tommy Thornton.

193
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:40,586
No. No. See, I didn't plan
on acting or anything.

194
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:43,286
When did you know, Tommy?

195
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:45,927
I know what?

196
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:48,499
That we were in love.

197
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,004
Love?

198
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:58,235
Baby, you don't want to fall in love with a guy like me.

199
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:01,108
It's too late. I'm crazy about you.

200
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:05,911
I'm breathing it, drinking it all in.
Aren't you?

201
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:13,388
I don't know what I'm drinking,
dollface, but if this is love...

202
00:20:13,594 --> 00:20:15,755
...pour me another glass.

203
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:18,727
Are you trying to be bad at this?

204
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:22,096
No, just comes naturally.

205
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:27,334
All right, everybody, let's go to the end.

206
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:34,612
Don't even pretend you won't be great.

207
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:38,717
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right. See you.

208
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:43,514
Bye.

209
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:55,563
- So would it kill you to try?
- Yep, and I'm too young to die.

210
00:20:55,736 --> 00:20:58,933
You don't care about classes, but you like school...

211
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:02,870
...because you're popular
and you'll never be on top again.

212
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:08,413
- That's thoroughly predictable.
- Your act only works on an audience.

213
00:21:40,748 --> 00:21:42,113
Feeling Christian?

214
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,009
Seat belt?

215
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:08,508
- I forfeit.
- Thank you.

216
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:10,973
Forty-two.

217
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:13,310
What do you mean, forty-two?

218
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:16,677
Forty-two is befriend somebody
I don't like.

219
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:21,913
It's a to-do list I have for my life.

220
00:22:22,122 --> 00:22:24,147
Like getting a new personality?

221
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:27,327
Join the Peace Corps, make a medical discovery.

222
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:28,517
Ambitious.

223
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:32,426
Be in two places at once, get a tattoo.

224
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:36,193
What's number one?

225
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:41,967
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.

226
00:22:57,157 --> 00:22:57,987
I've come...

227
00:22:58,258 --> 00:22:59,555
...to see if you're ready.

228
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,696
Take a good look. The only thing
I'm ready for is a dirt nap.

229
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:06,730
Ready to look into your heart, Tom Thornton.

230
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:11,064
Your words have been heard, and not just by me.

231
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:14,063
When you walked into...

232
00:23:15,843 --> 00:23:21,008
Shit. When you walked into my club,
that wasn't just a coincidence.

233
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:23,308
Nothing's coincidence, baby.

234
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:27,146
You know you're the only one who can make me sing.

235
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:30,721
Yeah, Miss Garber!
You'll put Eric in all your plays!

236
00:23:30,924 --> 00:23:33,586
Eric, I'll put you in all my plays!

237
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:37,763
Come on. Do you know I got
three weeks to memorize all this?

238
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:42,459
You couldn't pull this off
in three months! De Niro couldn't!

239
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,262
I didn't write it, okay?

240
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:49,067
But you're gonna make a jackass
of yourself in front of everyone.

241
00:23:49,276 --> 00:23:53,679
Look, I don't have a choice,
so would you help me out, please?

242
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:57,909
I'm just busting on you.

243
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:03,249
I'll be there opening night,
front row. And you can count on it.

244
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:05,789
With tomatoes.

245
00:24:06,293 --> 00:24:07,988
Thanks, man.

246
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:11,926
Landon? Boys, can you help
with these groceries?

247
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:14,100
- Yeah.
- No problem.

248
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:24,472
Jamie.

249
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:27,537
What do you want?

250
00:24:27,748 --> 00:24:32,481
I've known you for years. You've
never been the first to say hello.

251
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:36,182
I need help with my lines.

252
00:24:37,624 --> 00:24:41,890
- Landon Carter's asking me for help?
- Yeah.

253
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:44,894
Okay, I'll pray for you.

254
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:47,099
Jamie, look...

255
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:51,635
You've obviously never asked anybody
for help before, right?

256
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,776
A request like yours requires flattery and groveling.

257
00:24:56,977 --> 00:25:00,469
It can't be about you.
It has to be for the common good.

258
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:05,482
It is for the common good.
Eddie Zimmerhoff deserves the best.

259
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:10,417
- Please?
- Okay. One condition, though.

260
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:12,284
What's that?

261
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:15,894
You have to promise you won't fall in love with me.

262
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:24,598
- That's not a problem.
- Okay. I'll see you today after school.

263
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:30,908
Landon Carter is coming here?

264
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:34,342
He's dangerous, careless, the worst kind of bully.

265
00:25:34,548 --> 00:25:37,483
Daddy, what about forgiveness?

266
00:25:37,751 --> 00:25:41,209
I thought we had discussed that I would decide...

267
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:44,447
...how I wanted to spend
my time and my life.

268
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:47,889
It's him I don't trust, not you.

269
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,138
You gonna keep me out here all afternoon?

270
00:26:03,744 --> 00:26:05,302
Come on in.

271
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:14,717
My script is in my room. I'll be
right down. Make yourself at home.

272
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:16,913
Oh, yeah.

273
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:19,319
It's not likely.

274
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:40,172
That is one scary-looking...

275
00:26:40,814 --> 00:26:43,180
- Jesus!
- No, Jamie's father.

276
00:26:44,284 --> 00:26:48,186
Hello, Mr. Carter. I understand
you're the lead in the play.

277
00:26:48,388 --> 00:26:50,117
Congratulations.

278
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:53,293
Thanks for letting me come over and run lines.

279
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:55,586
I didn't let you.

280
00:26:56,396 --> 00:27:01,561
It's a school night. Let's get
one thing straight, Mr. Carter.

281
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:07,467
You think that, on Sundays,
I don't see you from where I stand.

282
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:10,669
But I see you.

283
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,613
I'll be in my office, just here.

284
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:17,772
Ready?

285
00:27:19,453 --> 00:27:21,717
Yeah, let's go.

286
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,760
- Landon! Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

287
00:27:30,964 --> 00:27:33,762
- Hey, come here.
- What's up?

288
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:37,300
- Are we cool?
- Yeah, sure.

289
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,353
What the hell?

290
00:28:13,173 --> 00:28:16,734
- What are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same.

291
00:28:16,944 --> 00:28:20,641
Do you normally walk alone in a cemetery at night?

292
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:22,280
Maybe.

293
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:25,008
Where you going?

294
00:28:26,086 --> 00:28:28,054
Come and see.

295
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:36,987
Okay. What is that?

296
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:41,930
This is my telescope.
I built it when I was 12.

297
00:28:42,936 --> 00:28:45,029
Take a look.

298
00:28:49,343 --> 00:28:52,779
Saturn. Very cool.

299
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,247
I'm planning on building a larger one
so I can see the comet Hyakutake.

300
00:28:58,452 --> 00:29:02,320
It comes this spring.
Nobody knows when it'll be back.

301
00:29:02,522 --> 00:29:06,288
Nature's miracles. I get it.

302
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:10,327
- Get what?
- That you're into all this stuff.

303
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:13,056
This stuff?

304
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:17,635
I have my beliefs.
I have faith, but don't you?

305
00:29:17,804 --> 00:29:21,399
No. There's too much bad shit
in this world.

306
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:24,066
Without suffering, there's no compassion.

307
00:29:24,277 --> 00:29:26,939
Tell that to those who suffer.

308
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:33,953
This is what I love about early
spring. Where those legs been hiding?

309
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:37,652
- She's trashy.
- Well, if it isn't the Virgin Mary.

310
00:29:38,325 --> 00:29:40,691
Here comes your leading lady.

311
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:44,921
Hey, Carter.
So I'll see you after school?

312
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:47,961
In your dreams.

313
00:29:57,944 --> 00:30:01,971
Hi. Where's your sweater?

314
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:11,089
Let's get out of here.

315
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:14,158
What's up, dude?

316
00:30:41,054 --> 00:30:45,855
Come on, Jamie.
Open the door, please!

317
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:49,786
What do you want?

318
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:53,762
- You're not in a good mood.
- You don't miss a thing.

319
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:57,964
Listen, I was hoping we could run lines together.

320
00:30:58,205 --> 00:31:01,333
Okay, but just not so anybody knows, right?

321
00:31:01,808 --> 00:31:06,177
I just figured we could surprise
everyone with how good I get.

322
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:08,176
We could be secret friends.

323
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:12,147
Exactly! It's like
you're reading my mind.

324
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:15,788
Great. Maybe you could read mine?

325
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,190
Jamie, I can't just be your friend.

326
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:28,595
Landon, I thought I saw something
in you. Something good.

327
00:31:28,835 --> 00:31:31,303
But I was very wrong.

328
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:39,511
Damn it!

329
00:31:43,984 --> 00:31:46,953
Sorry. Sorry.

330
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,785
You know the answer?

331
00:32:27,194 --> 00:32:29,628
Come on, man, I know you know.

332
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:40,598
Okay. It's you, me and the basket.

333
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:43,367
We form the three corners of a triangle.

334
00:32:43,577 --> 00:32:46,171
Take a step towards the basket.

335
00:32:48,715 --> 00:32:52,310
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?

336
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,316
- Yeah.
- Are you?

337
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:58,150
- Yeah.
- So, what did we just make?

338
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:05,689
- A similar triangle?
- Yes. Okay, make me an isosceles.

339
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:10,966
You got it, two sides the same.

340
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:13,901
Okay, enough of this. Let's play.

341
00:35:24,504 --> 00:35:27,234
I came to say I'm sorry.

342
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:33,770
Well, you did. Feel better?

343
00:35:33,947 --> 00:35:36,177
No. I feel like shit.

344
00:35:36,383 --> 00:35:41,343
You know what? I actually thought
I wanted to be your friend.

345
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:48,559
And now I have no idea why. No idea.

346
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:53,394
I made that jump once.

347
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:56,458
I thought I was a badass.

348
00:35:57,737 --> 00:36:02,868
I remember actually saying that I meant to belly flop.

349
00:36:05,512 --> 00:36:07,036
Did it hurt?

350
00:36:09,716 --> 00:36:11,650
Like hell.

351
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,414
Good.

352
00:36:22,695 --> 00:36:25,425
So I guess I'll see you at school then.

353
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:33,272
- Pour me a drink, Joey.
- You promised me, Tommy.

354
00:36:33,473 --> 00:36:36,636
No more of your no-goodnik schemes.

355
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:39,243
You promised me we'd go to Paris.

356
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:43,212
I won't sit on my keister and watch the fat cats get rich.

357
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:46,352
Trust me. This is a sure thing.

358
00:36:46,553 --> 00:36:49,420
That's it! We are through!

359
00:36:49,856 --> 00:36:52,586
Go ahead and run your booze, you big dope!

360
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:55,522
And I hope you drown in it!

361
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:59,357
So you must be the new girl he's hired.

362
00:36:59,866 --> 00:37:02,300
The singer?

363
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:07,303
You want some free advice
about this one? Stay far away.

364
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:10,943
He's nothing but trouble in cheap spats.

365
00:37:13,613 --> 00:37:16,707
Look, I ain't blaming you.

366
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:19,646
I ain't asking for forgiveness, either.

367
00:37:20,753 --> 00:37:22,983
I just did what I had to.

368
00:37:28,328 --> 00:37:33,265
When you walked out of the rain and into my club...

369
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:37,092
...that wasn't just coincidence,
was it?

370
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:39,464
Nothing's coincidence.

371
00:37:39,672 --> 00:37:44,166
Your face... You look so familiar.

372
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:49,073
Like this dame I knew once,
only it wasn't real, it was a dream.

373
00:37:49,315 --> 00:37:51,806
Tell me about this dream girl.

374
00:37:56,689 --> 00:38:00,648
Well, I don't remember.

375
00:38:04,631 --> 00:38:06,792
All I know...

376
00:38:10,603 --> 00:38:13,163
...is you're beautiful.

377
00:38:22,515 --> 00:38:24,039
The song, the song.

378
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:26,485
The dream.

379
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,519
Help me to remember.

380
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:33,850
Will you sing for me?

381
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:40,862
That was great.

382
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:47,637
Hi, kids.

383
00:42:48,047 --> 00:42:52,211
Honey, I couldn't believe it.
What a transformation.

384
00:42:52,418 --> 00:42:54,010
Thanks, but please stop.

385
00:42:54,187 --> 00:42:56,712
- Don't be home too late.
- Okay. Thanks.

386
00:42:56,923 --> 00:42:59,153
Okay, okay.

387
00:43:00,026 --> 00:43:03,689
- Interesting rewrite you did there.
- I did my best.

388
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:06,296
Your acting didn't suck either.

389
00:43:06,499 --> 00:43:10,094
- Gotta go. Take it easy, man.
- Okay.

390
00:43:10,303 --> 00:43:13,568
- Landon, you were marvelous!
- Thank you.

391
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,435
Landon? Fine performance, son.

392
00:43:20,646 --> 00:43:24,514
- What are you doing here?
- I thought we'd get a bite.

393
00:43:24,717 --> 00:43:26,912
- I'm not hungry.
- Don't walk away.

394
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,882
You taught me how.

395
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:39,856
Oh, my God.

396
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:42,361
Look who's here.

397
00:43:47,106 --> 00:43:48,801
Don't look at him.

398
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:51,568
You don't want to stare too much.

399
00:43:53,713 --> 00:43:56,682
I guess he doesn't want to sit with us.

400
00:44:10,429 --> 00:44:13,990
- People can see.
- That would ruin your reputation how?

401
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:15,690
What's that?

402
00:44:17,637 --> 00:44:22,165
I'm reading books on Rothman's list
of contemporary American authors.

403
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:26,869
- And how many books are there?
- A hundred.

404
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:31,914
But then there's his British list and his European list.

405
00:44:32,118 --> 00:44:36,418
So is this on your list, to read all these books?

406
00:44:42,895 --> 00:44:47,127
Jamie, I'm trying here, okay?

407
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:49,028
Maybe...

408
00:44:50,636 --> 00:44:54,299
Maybe I miss spending time with you.

409
00:44:54,507 --> 00:44:59,342
- Maybe you inspire me.
- Sounds like bull.

410
00:44:59,545 --> 00:45:01,240
- Which part?
- All of it.

411
00:45:01,447 --> 00:45:04,348
- It's not.
- Prove it.

412
00:45:12,391 --> 00:45:14,120
Jamie!

413
00:45:15,161 --> 00:45:19,063
- You've no idea how to be a friend.
- I don't just want that.

414
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,395
- You don't know what you want.
- You're scared someone wants you.

415
00:45:23,602 --> 00:45:27,902
- Why would that scare me?
- You couldn't hide behind books...

416
00:45:28,107 --> 00:45:31,907
...or your fricking telescope,
or your faith.

417
00:45:32,078 --> 00:45:35,343
No. You know the real reason
why you're scared?

418
00:45:35,514 --> 00:45:38,347
It's because you want to be with me too.

419
00:45:58,938 --> 00:46:01,964
We gonna get this party jumping!

420
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:06,143
Can you turn down Soul Train?
Some of us are trying to work.

421
00:46:06,345 --> 00:46:09,746
You really know how to bust a robot's groove.

422
00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:14,579
It's all good because we'll get Club
Landon and Club Eric jumping now.

423
00:46:14,787 --> 00:46:17,449
What we got here?

424
00:46:17,656 --> 00:46:22,855
Okay, okay, you're not feeling my
hip-hop, but what the hell is this?

425
00:46:23,229 --> 00:46:25,697
Jamie lent it to me.

426
00:46:25,898 --> 00:46:28,492
You're listening to her people's music.

427
00:46:28,701 --> 00:46:30,293
- Her people?
- Yeah...

428
00:46:30,503 --> 00:46:34,940
...her Bible-hugging,
crucifix-wearing...

429
00:46:35,141 --> 00:46:37,974
...honk-if-you-love-Jesus people.

430
00:46:38,177 --> 00:46:40,077
- She's not like that.
- Well...

431
00:46:40,246 --> 00:46:44,046
...you got Belinda thinking
that little lip action...

432
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,083
...between you and Jamie
was kind of real.

433
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:58,453
What's with you? You don't have time
for your real friends anymore.

434
00:46:58,664 --> 00:47:02,760
I don't know, buddy. I'm just over it.

435
00:47:02,968 --> 00:47:06,597
I'm sick and tired of doing the same shit all the time.

436
00:47:06,806 --> 00:47:11,038
This girl's changed you, and you don't even know it, man.

437
00:47:11,243 --> 00:47:14,940
- Let me guess, Belinda say that too?
- No.

438
00:47:15,247 --> 00:47:16,908
I did.

439
00:47:28,694 --> 00:47:30,184
You.

440
00:47:30,362 --> 00:47:32,694
Me.

441
00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:38,896
What is it?

442
00:47:39,105 --> 00:47:41,335
I got you something.

443
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,944
Thank you.

444
00:47:50,249 --> 00:47:53,150
Well, I'll see you at school.

445
00:47:53,786 --> 00:47:55,447
Okay.

446
00:48:04,663 --> 00:48:08,099
- Mr. Carter.
- Later, Reverend.

447
00:48:30,456 --> 00:48:32,481
Boys like that...

448
00:48:34,527 --> 00:48:36,461
...they have...

449
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:43,863
They have expectations.

450
00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:47,664
The rules around here aren't going to change.

451
00:48:47,873 --> 00:48:49,841
Fine.

452
00:48:53,895 --> 00:48:56,796
You might not care what I say or think...

453
00:48:56,999 --> 00:48:59,991
...but you should care
about God's opinion.

454
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:03,770
I think he wants me to be happy.

455
00:49:06,942 --> 00:49:10,434
Dad, it's just a sweater.

456
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:13,547
I'm going to make us some dinner, okay?

457
00:49:24,993 --> 00:49:27,461
I talked to your dad today.

458
00:49:27,663 --> 00:49:32,498
Said he saw you at the play for about 10 seconds.

459
00:49:32,701 --> 00:49:37,070
Sending a check once a month doesn't
exactly make him a father.

460
00:49:39,207 --> 00:49:43,906
- Landon, there are a lot of reasons...
- He left us.

461
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,674
You need to forgive him too.

462
00:49:52,854 --> 00:49:57,450
Jamie Sullivan! Oh, me, oh, my,
look at Jamie Sullivan.

463
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:01,356
She was looking all right in that play.

464
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:02,928
She doesn't look hot.

465
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:08,398
Yeah, I would have to say during the play, she looked hot.

466
00:50:08,603 --> 00:50:10,468
I have the best idea.

467
00:50:11,606 --> 00:50:14,905
Can you do something, like, move it?

468
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:18,212
Maybe move it around a little something here.

469
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,439
Take one.

470
00:50:23,919 --> 00:50:26,945
Let me stop it for a second.
Check it out.

471
00:50:29,324 --> 00:50:31,952
Hey, look at this.

472
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,025
Here.

473
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,362
Take one. Look.

474
00:50:42,003 --> 00:50:45,404
- Jamie. Hi.
- Hi.

475
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:49,976
Listen, I just want you to know, no hard feelings.

476
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:53,341
Landon and I are way over.

477
00:50:53,548 --> 00:50:56,847
I really don't know what you're talking about.

478
00:51:00,822 --> 00:51:02,756
You'd be so beautiful...

479
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:05,825
...if you knew how to do your makeup.

480
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,764
- Come on, eat lunch with me.
- Okay.

481
00:51:10,966 --> 00:51:12,957
- Want a Tic Tac?
- No, thanks.

482
00:51:13,168 --> 00:51:14,658
Okay.

483
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:28,042
Wow.

484
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,718
Is that you?

485
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:38,519
Nice bod.

486
00:52:06,721 --> 00:52:11,351
Look, this is about me, okay?
This is not you.

487
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,551
Stay here.

488
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:20,632
Hey, man, no wonder you been keeping her locked up.

489
00:52:20,836 --> 00:52:24,101
I had no idea this was underneath all that.

490
00:52:26,408 --> 00:52:28,876
- Dean, stop!
- You stay out of this!

491
00:52:37,352 --> 00:52:40,788
- We're through. We're through.
- That's great.

492
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:43,117
- We're through forever!
- You okay?

493
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:45,883
- You made a mistake, Landon!
- You sure?

494
00:52:46,094 --> 00:52:47,857
Let's get out of here.

495
00:52:48,063 --> 00:52:50,531
Hey! You're a little chickenshit!

496
00:52:52,634 --> 00:52:55,831
Baby, I'm sorry. Okay?

497
00:52:56,037 --> 00:52:59,268
They're animals, all right?

498
00:52:59,474 --> 00:53:01,840
You want me to take you home?

499
00:53:04,112 --> 00:53:05,739
Let's get out of here.

500
00:53:06,948 --> 00:53:11,647
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

501
00:53:12,654 --> 00:53:16,920
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.

502
00:53:22,831 --> 00:53:27,063
- I want to ask you something.
- Okay.

503
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:35,840
Will you go out with me on Saturday night?

504
00:53:38,947 --> 00:53:41,711
I'm sorry. I can't go.

505
00:53:45,453 --> 00:53:48,889
- You have something else going on?
- No.

506
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:53,356
- It's not that.
- Then what is it?

507
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:01,731
I'm not allowed to date.

508
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:11,035
"Do not be deceived.
God is not mocked.

509
00:54:13,048 --> 00:54:17,917
Whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.

510
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:22,886
For he who sows to his flesh,
will of the flesh reap..."

511
00:54:23,091 --> 00:54:25,924
- Can I help you?
- Yes, sir.

512
00:54:26,094 --> 00:54:29,860
I'd like to ask your daughter to dinner on Saturday night.

513
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:32,258
That's not possible.

514
00:54:34,436 --> 00:54:40,136
With all due respect, sir, I ask you to reconsider.

515
00:54:40,342 --> 00:54:44,779
With all due respect, Mr. Carter,
I made my decision.

516
00:54:46,781 --> 00:54:50,581
You can exit the way you entered.

517
00:54:55,123 --> 00:54:58,889
I'm sorry I haven't treated Jamie the way I should have.

518
00:54:59,094 --> 00:55:01,756
She deserves more than that.

519
00:55:02,597 --> 00:55:05,293
I'm asking you for the same thing...

520
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,731
...you teach us every day in church.

521
00:55:10,405 --> 00:55:12,396
And that's faith.

522
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,614
I can't believe you asked permission.

523
00:55:21,783 --> 00:55:24,843
It's no big deal.
He was cool about it, anyway.

524
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,885
- Thank you.
- This is for you.

525
00:55:27,088 --> 00:55:30,819
- Thank you very much.
- Would you like something to drink?

526
00:55:31,026 --> 00:55:33,290
- Sweet tea, please.
- Make that two.

527
00:55:33,495 --> 00:55:35,224
Right away.

528
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:40,862
This place is really nice.
Is this okay?

529
00:55:41,136 --> 00:55:43,900
- Don't even worry about it, okay?
- Okay.

530
00:55:44,105 --> 00:55:46,403
Choose whatever you want.

531
00:55:47,108 --> 00:55:49,736
So, what'll it be?

532
00:55:50,712 --> 00:55:52,942
Is everything okay?

533
00:55:53,548 --> 00:55:57,245
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, me too. Thanks.

534
00:56:04,025 --> 00:56:06,323
Would you like to dance?

535
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:11,262
Sorry, I don't dance.

536
00:56:11,466 --> 00:56:15,232
Me neither. I mean, not usually
in front of anybody.

537
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:21,237
Well, no. I mean, I don't at all.
As in, I can't.

538
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:24,207
Everybody can dance.

539
00:56:24,412 --> 00:56:27,210
Come on, you can't be that bad.

540
00:56:28,383 --> 00:56:30,283
Please?

541
00:56:30,919 --> 00:56:32,580
For me?

542
00:56:33,888 --> 00:56:35,583
Come on.

543
00:56:50,105 --> 00:56:54,667
Sorry, I told you I was bad at this.

544
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:59,108
- In all fairness, you warned me, right?
- That's right.

545
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:06,784
So, what's number one on your list?

546
00:57:08,957 --> 00:57:11,391
Okay.

547
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:16,087
Number one on my list is getting out of Beaufort.

548
00:57:17,732 --> 00:57:20,257
Getting out won't be your problem.

549
00:57:20,468 --> 00:57:25,030
It's more like figuring out what to do
when you get somewhere.

550
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,174
What do you mean?

551
00:57:29,177 --> 00:57:32,010
I mean, you can do anything.

552
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:53,166
- Where are we going?
- Just hold on, you'll see.

553
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:59,997
Come on, come on. Let's go!

554
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:02,972
- What are we doing?
- Run!

555
00:58:03,178 --> 00:58:06,443
- Okay, okay. Stand there.
- All right.

556
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:10,584
- One foot there, and one foot here.
- Okay.

557
00:58:12,687 --> 00:58:15,656
You're acting crazy. What's going on?

558
00:58:15,857 --> 00:58:19,122
Right now, you're straddling the state line.

559
00:58:20,795 --> 00:58:22,524
Okay.

560
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,862
You're in two places at once.

561
00:58:40,348 --> 00:58:44,444
Okay, butterfly, rosebud or star?

562
00:58:44,652 --> 00:58:46,643
You choose.

563
00:58:48,723 --> 00:58:51,351
- Butterfly.
- Okay.

564
00:58:56,464 --> 00:58:58,489
Where do you want it?

565
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,735
Right here.

566
00:59:11,346 --> 00:59:13,246
Okay.

567
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:23,915
How can you see places like this...

568
01:00:24,118 --> 01:00:28,953
...and have moments like this,
and not believe?

569
01:00:30,892 --> 01:00:33,452
You're lucky to be so sure.

570
01:00:37,932 --> 01:00:40,230
It's like the wind.

571
01:00:40,601 --> 01:00:45,504
I can't see it, but I feel it.

572
01:00:45,707 --> 01:00:47,800
What do you feel?

573
01:00:50,678 --> 01:00:55,206
I feel wonder and beauty...

574
01:00:55,416 --> 01:00:59,182
...joy, love.

575
01:01:00,655 --> 01:01:04,386
I mean, it's the center of everything.

576
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:10,193
I might kiss you.

577
01:01:12,533 --> 01:01:14,831
I might be bad at it.

578
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:20,707
That's not possible.

579
01:01:45,133 --> 01:01:47,192
I love you.

580
01:02:00,181 --> 01:02:04,618
Now would be the time to say something.

581
01:02:07,188 --> 01:02:10,680
I told you not to fall in love with me.

582
01:03:17,925 --> 01:03:22,157
Jamie. Say good night to Mr. Carter.

583
01:03:23,831 --> 01:03:26,925
Landon, go home. The night's over.

584
01:03:27,135 --> 01:03:28,830
- Good night.
- Good night.

585
01:03:29,036 --> 01:03:30,936
Good night, sir.

586
01:03:34,408 --> 01:03:37,844
Jamie, your behavior's sinful.

587
01:03:39,247 --> 01:03:43,741
- You act with that boy like you're...
- In love?

588
01:03:43,951 --> 01:03:48,251
- Jamie, you are a child.
- Dad, look at me...

589
01:03:48,456 --> 01:03:52,051
...I'm not a child.
- Then stop acting childish.

590
01:03:55,763 --> 01:03:57,628
I love him.

591
01:04:00,401 --> 01:04:04,804
Then be fair to him, Jamie, before things get worse.

592
01:04:26,227 --> 01:04:28,718
- Hey.
- Hey.

593
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:33,866
- Will you help me?
- Yeah.

594
01:04:34,068 --> 01:04:37,003
So, what did you tell your father?

595
01:04:37,205 --> 01:04:41,164
The truth. I just left you out of it.

596
01:04:42,276 --> 01:04:44,437
So, what do you want to see?

597
01:04:45,279 --> 01:04:46,871
Pluto.

598
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:50,606
Pluto only rises a few minutes before the sun.

599
01:04:50,818 --> 01:04:52,649
Right...

600
01:04:53,721 --> 01:04:57,885
...and I have brought us
a thermos of hot coffee...

601
01:05:00,494 --> 01:05:02,792
...and a blanket.

602
01:05:02,997 --> 01:05:06,831
- You planned this.
- Oh, I hoped for it.

603
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:11,195
Are you trying to seduce me?

604
01:05:11,405 --> 01:05:14,602
Why? Are you seducible?

605
01:05:16,577 --> 01:05:19,774
That's what I thought...

606
01:05:19,981 --> 01:05:22,643
...ergo, a second blanket.

607
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:26,843
- One for me, and one for you.
- Thank you.

608
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:43,898
- Can you find this star right here?
- Sure.

609
01:05:53,814 --> 01:05:57,375
So why am I looking for this star?

610
01:05:58,386 --> 01:06:01,082
Because I had it named for you.

611
01:06:03,257 --> 01:06:04,918
See?

612
01:06:05,726 --> 01:06:07,591
It's official.

613
01:06:08,195 --> 01:06:12,632
It's from the International Star Registry.

614
01:06:16,203 --> 01:06:18,433
This is wonderful!

615
01:06:23,344 --> 01:06:25,403
I love you.

616
01:06:38,326 --> 01:06:42,285
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm stopping.

617
01:06:51,038 --> 01:06:54,872
So, what's your number one?

618
01:06:59,013 --> 01:07:02,676
To marry in the church where my mother grew up.

619
01:07:02,883 --> 01:07:05,716
That's where my parents were married.

620
01:07:35,116 --> 01:07:38,779
- Did you just get in?
- Yeah.

621
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,385
Thank heavens I didn't know.
I'd have been panicked.

622
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:44,285
Sorry.

623
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:49,428
Landon, were you with Jamie?

624
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:52,997
Landon, be careful.
She's the reverend's daughter.

625
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,668
- Mom...
- Please!

626
01:07:56,036 --> 01:07:57,936
It's different with her.

627
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:01,606
- It's different with her.
- Yes.

628
01:08:04,011 --> 01:08:06,673
It better be different with her.

629
01:08:09,016 --> 01:08:13,817
I was doing laundry the other day, and I found this.

630
01:08:21,595 --> 01:08:24,530
"Examine a moon rock.

631
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:28,063
Go to college.

632
01:08:28,736 --> 01:08:31,967
Get into medical school."

633
01:08:35,709 --> 01:08:42,012
Honey, these are really beautiful ambitions.

634
01:08:42,216 --> 01:08:48,712
- But you'll have to work really hard.
- I can do that.

635
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:53,555
Yeah, you can.

636
01:08:58,065 --> 01:09:00,260
Mama...

637
01:09:00,968 --> 01:09:04,096
...Jamie has faith in me.

638
01:09:05,706 --> 01:09:07,230
You know?

639
01:09:07,942 --> 01:09:12,140
She makes me want to be different.

640
01:09:13,047 --> 01:09:15,015
Better.

641
01:09:16,217 --> 01:09:20,119
I was so drunk, I don't remember anything.

642
01:09:25,025 --> 01:09:29,121
That's great.
Citizen high to citizen low.

643
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:35,192
Are you worried about your college applications?

644
01:09:35,402 --> 01:09:36,835
No.

645
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:39,567
I'm not applying.

646
01:09:39,773 --> 01:09:43,573
- I thought you said...
- No, you assumed.

647
01:09:43,777 --> 01:09:48,180
- Take a year off, try the Peace Corps?
- No.

648
01:09:50,117 --> 01:09:52,415
What are you gonna do?

649
01:09:55,856 --> 01:09:57,756
I'm sick.

650
01:09:57,958 --> 01:10:01,655
- I'll take you home, you'll be...
- No, Landon!

651
01:10:02,496 --> 01:10:03,963
I'm sick.

652
01:10:07,935 --> 01:10:10,426
I have leukemia.

653
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:17,434
No.

654
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:21,077
- You're 18, you're perfect.
- No.

655
01:10:21,282 --> 01:10:25,912
I found out two years ago.
I've stopped responding to treatments.

656
01:10:30,724 --> 01:10:33,090
So why didn't you tell me?

657
01:10:33,294 --> 01:10:37,628
The doctor said I should live life
normally, as best I could.

658
01:10:37,831 --> 01:10:41,198
I didn't want anybody to be weird around me.

659
01:10:41,368 --> 01:10:44,667
- Including me?
- Especially you!

660
01:10:47,641 --> 01:10:52,669
I was getting along fine.
I accepted it, and then you happened!

661
01:10:57,017 --> 01:11:01,351
I do not need a reason to be angry with God.

662
01:12:09,823 --> 01:12:12,417
Dad, open the door!

663
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:24,260
Landon?

664
01:12:25,806 --> 01:12:28,741
- I need your help.
- What's wrong? You okay?

665
01:12:28,942 --> 01:12:32,400
It's my girlfriend, Jamie. She's...

666
01:12:34,248 --> 01:12:39,481
She's got cancer. And I need you
to come and see her right now.

667
01:12:39,653 --> 01:12:41,416
Okay, calm down.

668
01:12:41,588 --> 01:12:45,149
- Can you help me or not?
- I don't know her case.

669
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:49,455
I don't know her history.
I'm a cardiologist. I can't...

670
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:54,191
You know, just forget it. I knew it.

671
01:12:54,401 --> 01:12:57,768
Would you wait? Landon, wait!

672
01:14:35,736 --> 01:14:38,330
Your mom called me.

673
01:14:39,406 --> 01:14:41,738
Talk to me, man.

674
01:14:41,975 --> 01:14:44,136
About what?

675
01:14:46,446 --> 01:14:48,311
About you...

676
01:14:48,515 --> 01:14:50,608
...about Jamie.

677
01:14:53,987 --> 01:14:56,512
What's there to talk about?

678
01:14:58,325 --> 01:15:01,453
She's the best person I've ever known.

679
01:15:05,732 --> 01:15:08,394
I didn't understand.

680
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,904
It's okay, man.

681
01:15:17,311 --> 01:15:19,279
It's okay.

682
01:15:41,134 --> 01:15:46,299
It's so nice to see you again.
You're welcome. Watch yourself now.

683
01:15:49,209 --> 01:15:51,609
I'm not going anywhere.

684
01:15:51,945 --> 01:15:54,436
Please tell Jamie that.

685
01:16:23,744 --> 01:16:28,977
I'm so sorry.
I really should have told you sooner.

686
01:16:29,182 --> 01:16:31,275
I made you do too many things...

687
01:16:31,485 --> 01:16:34,682
If anything, you kept me healthy longer.

688
01:16:43,864 --> 01:16:46,230
Are you scared?

689
01:16:47,301 --> 01:16:48,791
To death.

690
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,104
Lighten up.

691
01:16:54,308 --> 01:16:56,572
It's not funny.

692
01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:20,861
I'm scared of not being with you.

693
01:17:24,604 --> 01:17:27,596
Oh, baby, that will never happen.

694
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,581
I'll be here.

695
01:17:41,722 --> 01:17:43,053
Mom.

696
01:17:45,559 --> 01:17:47,686
Can you do me a favor?

697
01:19:20,087 --> 01:19:22,419
So I talked to Eric.

698
01:19:29,096 --> 01:19:31,724
Need some help with this stuff?

699
01:19:32,265 --> 01:19:33,789
Sure.

700
01:20:11,404 --> 01:20:14,066
What's that boy doing in the yard?

701
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:20,102
What's the matter? Jamie, honey?

702
01:21:26,179 --> 01:21:30,616
Landon. Run along, son.

703
01:21:30,817 --> 01:21:33,081
I'm not tired.

704
01:21:34,554 --> 01:21:37,523
I need just a minute with her.

705
01:21:45,532 --> 01:21:49,332
- I'll be back, okay?
- Okay.

706
01:22:13,159 --> 01:22:15,127
Daddy...

707
01:22:16,463 --> 01:22:18,693
...so serious.

708
01:22:28,742 --> 01:22:34,738
Do you remember when you were about 5 or 6...

709
01:22:34,981 --> 01:22:38,212
...and you said you hated gravity...

710
01:22:38,418 --> 01:22:41,819
...and you wanted
to jump off the roof and fly?

711
01:22:44,124 --> 01:22:48,754
I was so angry at you for making me come down.

712
01:22:48,962 --> 01:22:54,366
Honey, if I kept you too close, it's
because I wanted to keep you longer.

713
01:22:55,535 --> 01:22:57,196
Dad...

714
01:23:01,608 --> 01:23:05,772
You know, when I lost your mother...

715
01:23:10,784 --> 01:23:15,084
...I was afraid that my heart
would never open again.

716
01:23:23,063 --> 01:23:26,590
Jamie, I couldn't look at you for days.

717
01:23:32,072 --> 01:23:34,006
But then...

718
01:23:38,445 --> 01:23:41,778
I love you so much.

719
01:24:09,309 --> 01:24:11,869
I wanted to give you these.

720
01:24:12,278 --> 01:24:15,042
The pictures from the play.

721
01:24:21,321 --> 01:24:24,688
- I'm sorry about the flyers.
- It doesn't matter.

722
01:24:28,495 --> 01:24:31,658
I guess you're with who you should be.

723
01:24:32,999 --> 01:24:35,194
It's like she chose you.

724
01:24:36,536 --> 01:24:39,835
Yeah, I don't even know why.

725
01:24:42,575 --> 01:24:44,543
I do.

726
01:25:24,584 --> 01:25:26,313
How you feeling?

727
01:25:26,519 --> 01:25:30,114
- I'm okay. How are you?
- Pretty good.

728
01:25:30,323 --> 01:25:33,349
- I have something for you.
- You do?

729
01:25:38,631 --> 01:25:41,896
Don't worry, it's not a Bible.

730
01:25:42,268 --> 01:25:47,706
It was my mother's. It's got quotes
from her favorite books...

731
01:25:48,975 --> 01:25:52,570
...and quotes by famous people.
Her thoughts.

732
01:25:54,481 --> 01:25:58,781
- Come on.
- Okay, let's check it out.

733
01:26:06,459 --> 01:26:08,552
"What is a friend?

734
01:26:08,761 --> 01:26:14,256
It's a single soul dwelling
in two bodies. Aristotle."

735
01:26:15,134 --> 01:26:18,035
- Right here.
- Okay.

736
01:26:18,671 --> 01:26:21,162
"Find out who you are...

737
01:26:21,374 --> 01:26:24,275
...and do it on purpose."

738
01:26:25,378 --> 01:26:27,243
That's Dolly Parton.

739
01:26:28,748 --> 01:26:31,410
I always thought she was smart.

740
01:26:41,394 --> 01:26:47,299
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous.

741
01:26:47,934 --> 01:26:51,734
Love is never boastful or conceited.

742
01:26:52,138 --> 01:26:55,699
It is never rude or selfish.

743
01:26:55,909 --> 01:27:01,040
It does not take offense
and is not resentful."

744
01:27:09,889 --> 01:27:13,188
- You know what I figured out today?
- What?

745
01:27:17,096 --> 01:27:19,792
Maybe God...

746
01:27:20,567 --> 01:27:25,334
...has a bigger plan for me
than I had for myself.

747
01:27:26,706 --> 01:27:31,370
Like, this journey never ends.

748
01:27:33,313 --> 01:27:37,511
Like, you were sent to me because I'm sick.

749
01:27:40,587 --> 01:27:43,522
To help me through all this.

750
01:27:54,734 --> 01:27:57,168
You're my angel.

751
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:16,218
What's going on?

752
01:28:16,422 --> 01:28:21,291
I get to go home.
Please thank your father for me.

753
01:28:21,494 --> 01:28:25,396
- What does she mean?
- He's been trying to reach you.

754
01:28:25,598 --> 01:28:29,227
He's going to pay for private home care.

755
01:28:58,798 --> 01:29:00,663
Thank you.

756
01:29:20,653 --> 01:29:22,644
Sorry.

757
01:29:24,757 --> 01:29:27,624
It's all right, son.

758
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:09,200
- I gotta finish this tonight.
- Here, something hot.

759
01:30:11,571 --> 01:30:14,597
Almost finished.
Did you order the mirrors?

760
01:30:14,807 --> 01:30:17,401
- Yeah, they're in here.
- Good.

761
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:21,569
- What about side bearings?
- An old phonographic turntable.

762
01:30:21,781 --> 01:30:25,512
So you think you can get all this done by tomorrow?

763
01:30:27,653 --> 01:30:30,816
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

764
01:30:31,124 --> 01:30:33,183
It's beautiful.

765
01:30:33,392 --> 01:30:36,259
Okay, it's time. Go check it out.

766
01:31:16,702 --> 01:31:18,067
There it is.

767
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:24,376
Come here. Come look.

768
01:31:26,445 --> 01:31:29,346
Come here. Come look, quick.

769
01:31:38,658 --> 01:31:40,888
That is cool.

770
01:31:50,703 --> 01:31:52,227
Do you love me?

771
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:04,446
- Will you do something for me then?
- Anything.

772
01:32:07,486 --> 01:32:09,977
Will you marry me?

773
01:33:34,173 --> 01:33:40,544
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous."

774
01:33:40,746 --> 01:33:45,979
- I love you.
- "Love is never boastful nor conceited.

775
01:33:46,185 --> 01:33:48,710
It is never rude or selfish.

776
01:33:48,921 --> 01:33:53,756
It does not take offense and is not resentful.

777
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:58,329
Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins...

778
01:33:58,531 --> 01:34:02,467
...but delights in the truth.

779
01:34:02,668 --> 01:34:08,038
It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope...

780
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:10,800
...and to endure...

781
01:34:12,178 --> 01:34:14,271
...whatever comes."

782
01:34:15,081 --> 01:34:19,450
- I, Landon Rollins Carter...
- I, Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan...

783
01:34:19,652 --> 01:34:22,018
...do solemnly swear...

784
01:34:22,221 --> 01:34:26,351
...to take Jamie Sullivan...
...to take Landon Rollins Carter...

785
01:34:26,559 --> 01:34:28,720
...as my wife.
...as my husband.

786
01:34:28,928 --> 01:34:34,889
To honor and to cherish her, all the days of my life.

787
01:34:54,653 --> 01:34:58,350
Jamie and I had a perfect summer together...

788
01:34:58,557 --> 01:35:03,324
...with more love than lots of people
know in a lifetime.

789
01:35:03,529 --> 01:35:08,057
And then she went, with her unfailing faith.

790
01:35:30,589 --> 01:35:33,183
It's been four years...

791
01:35:34,293 --> 01:35:37,990
...but the vision of Jamie
walking towards me...

792
01:35:39,298 --> 01:35:42,233
...will stay with me forever.

793
01:35:43,769 --> 01:35:46,738
Hello, Mr. Carter. Come in.

794
01:35:53,512 --> 01:35:56,777
- Have a seat, please.
- Thank you.

795
01:36:03,889 --> 01:36:05,447
Landon.

796
01:36:09,428 --> 01:36:12,158
- You look good.
- Thank you. You too.

797
01:36:12,364 --> 01:36:14,525
I'm getting by.

798
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:30,610
- What's new, Landon?
- Well, I got into medical school.

799
01:36:30,816 --> 01:36:32,977
Your mother told me that.

800
01:36:33,786 --> 01:36:38,814
We're so proud of you. Jamie would
have been proud of you too.

801
01:36:41,494 --> 01:36:43,519
Listen.

802
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:53,800
I want you to have this.

803
01:36:54,273 --> 01:36:56,571
Oh, Landon.

804
01:37:02,615 --> 01:37:04,606
Oh, my.

805
01:37:07,553 --> 01:37:08,577
Thank you.

806
01:37:13,192 --> 01:37:16,457
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.

807
01:37:21,534 --> 01:37:23,058
She did.

808
01:37:25,271 --> 01:37:27,262
It was you.

809
01:37:36,182 --> 01:37:39,242
Jamie saved my life.

810
01:37:39,885 --> 01:37:42,752
She taught me everything.

811
01:37:43,122 --> 01:37:46,489
About life, hope...

812
01:37:46,692 --> 01:37:49,422
...and the long journey ahead.

813
01:37:50,829 --> 01:37:53,229
I'll always miss her.

814
01:37:54,567 --> 01:37:58,799
But our love is like the wind.

815
01:38:00,573 --> 01:38:03,007
I can't see it...

816
01:38:03,375 --> 01:38:05,673
...but I can feel it.
