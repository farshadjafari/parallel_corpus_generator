hands and sing <i>Kumbaya.</i>

694
00:29:56,827 --> 00:29:58,496
Black.

695
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,330
So as long as you guys get numbers,

696
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:03,034
we are gonna get along just fine.

697
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:06,104
Now, if you don't,
I am gonna be icy.

698
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:07,438
And unpleasant, you dig?

699
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,575
I dig. We all dig.

700
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,844
I like to dig.
One time I went digging

701
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,045
for treasure and I
found a half a body.

702
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:17,582
Get out of my office!

703
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,450
I'm telling you, you can't give

704
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,986
an inch in those situations,

705
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,954
and I think we held our
ground pretty firmly.

706
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:27,357
Guys. Guys, we got
you an apartment

707
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:30,295
on the Upper East Side
and a whole new wardrobe.

708
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:33,263
That's wonderful!
When do we begin our broadcast?

709
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:34,531
Well, the big launch is tomorrow

710
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,601
at 12:00 noon.
Okay.

711
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:40,572
You guys are slotted for the
2:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. slot.

712
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:44,142
What? That's the graveyard shift!

713
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,243
"I ain't afraid of no ghost."

714
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,246
Oh, come on, it's
going to be great.

715
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:50,114
Let's get your keys.
Come on!

716
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,482
(PHONE RINGING)

717
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:52,482
RON: Is there booze
in the apartment?

718
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,218
FREDDIE: Of course
there's gonna be booze.
Of course.

(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)

720
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:19,477
BRICK: It won't stop.

721
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:22,346
Sometimes it stops,
but then it starts again.

722
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:27,317
What are you doing,
Chani? Answer it!

723
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,519
Hi. Yes, let me transfer you.

724
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:34,192
Your job is to answer the phones.

725
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,527
I'm getting ready for Secret Santa.
When is that again?

726
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:39,261
It's at Christmastime.
When else would it be?

727
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,034
(CLEARS THROAT)

728
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,734
I'm Brick.
I was dead last week.

729
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,505
I'm Chani.

730
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,407
I like the place between
your head and your body.

731
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,075
I like your hair.

732
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,144
It looks like wet popcorn.

733
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:57,548
Thank you.

734
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:58,916
Would you like to see
the smile that I use

735
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,084
when I pose for photographs?

736
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:00,920
Yes, please.

737
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:04,288
Do you want to see the face I make

738
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,056
when I see a snake
made out of candy?

739
00:32:06,223 --> 00:32:07,289
Yes.

740
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,528
That's good.

741
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,196
What's your favorite time of day?

742
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,398
Now.

743
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,536
What's your favorite time of day?

744
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,103
A minute ago.

745
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,405
Um...

746
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,259
(CHUCKLES)

747
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,712
Surprise!
Big daddy's back.

748
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,079
Ron.

749
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,550
What are you doing here?

750
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,721
I'm over at GNN.
I'm living in the city again.

751
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,423
I really wish that you
would have called first.

752
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,459
Look, it doesn't matter whose
fault the break-up was, okay?

753
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,361
I was stubborn.

754
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:18,462
You were like a mentally ill whore

755
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,731
having PMS from the 1800s.

756
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,700
What's your point, Ron?

757
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,568
The point is

758
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,238
(SIGHS) I'm back home.

759
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,307
And I want to spend
the rest of my life...

00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:30,673
MAN: Honey, who is it?

761
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,182
Hi, Ron. I'm Gary,
Veronica's lover.

762
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:50,728
So, is that a gift for me, Ron?

763
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,729
No, it's not.

764
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:55,198
It's for Walter.

765
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,134
Okay.

766
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,136
So when were you going
to tell me about Gary?

767
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,105
Ron. You walked
out on me.

768
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:04,241
What did you expect me to do?

769
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,612
Ron. This is awkward,
I know.

770
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:11,282
I'm sitting here with your wife.
We make love.

771
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,052
I'm this close to shooting
a flare gun at your dick.

772
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,686
Oh, Ron!

773
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,789
So what does this Gary
do for a living, huh?

774
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,356
Have you done a
background check on him?

775
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,659
Gary is actually one
of the most successful

776
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:24,161
psychologists in
all of Manhattan, Ron.

777
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,797
Really sweet.

00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,532
Are you reading my mind right now?

779
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:30,199
Ron, do you even know
what a psychologist is?

780
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,668
(QUIETLY) Fuck you.

781

GARY: It's okay.
VERONICA: You stop that!

783
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,108
He's externalizing.
That's okay.

784

No, it's not okay.
He's mad.

to throw that punch

Hey, Dad.

has a gift for you.

I have a gift specifically
for you, Walter.

Yes, Gary.

Okay, that's actually
for me, Walter.

796
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,509
No, it's not.
It's for Walter.

797
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,708
It's a superhero costume.

798
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,213
What is it?

799
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,581
It's "Lace Man."
It's a brand new superhero.

I'm going to be Lace Man!

801

Look, Ron.
Joint custody isn't easy.

802
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,320
But what we need to do is

803
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:26,123
rally around this little
guy right now, okay?

804
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,525
That's never gonna happen.

are unfit to be a mother!

that you took that
child to a cock fight?

I'm Lace Man!
The game of champions!
He had the time of his life!

He came home splattered in blood!

811
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:42,340
He picked eight winning cocks.

812
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,608
It's never been done!

813
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,275

to connect with Walter.

that's appropriate.

they got the curves,

and then at some point
during the evening,

00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:23,813
you reach down below the belt

a little muffellita,

about him, you know?

to be friends with him.

big deal is, you know.

you say something.

No, no, no!
Just give me a little piece of him.

The guys look up to
you so much, and

I just was a little jealous.
I just said some junk.

00:37:37,554 --> 00:37:38,856
That's funny.

All right, guys, that's enough.

00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,873
No, shut up, Freddie!

872
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,543

mouth, okay, Jack "Lame!"

Ooh.

Yeah. Mr. Butt-Vagina's
got some fight in him.

You listen to this one,

Yeah.

No, no, no.
Don't do this. Don't do this.

You're on at 2:00 a.m.

882
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,735
Jack has prime time!

883
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,137
Maybe... No.
Hey, Freddie, no, no. Hey.

884
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:32,543
I'll take that bet.
What are the stakes?

885
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,943
If we lose, I'll leave New York.

886
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,648

read the news again.

My late, great father,
Vadge Allenby,

924
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:15,146
gave me 300 million dollars,

925

and I toiled my whole bloody life

926
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,451
to turn that into
305 million dollars.

927
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:21,918
True story. True story.

928
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,487
Wow.

This is history.

931
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,460
This is like Columbus
discovering the New World.

932
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,096

933

954
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,581

How are they gonna keep
coming up with this stuff?

958
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,820
My guess is they'll
probably be scraping

959
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,157
the bottom of the barrel.

960
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,826
No, I have a feeling they'll
stick with their integrity

961
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,061

that needs to be reported.

Freddie?

971
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,282
No. Absolutely not.

972
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,818
I know. What if we get one
of those wildlife handlers?

973
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:04,188
We have him bring in,
oh, big game cats.

You know, wild, dangerous tigers and
lions and leopards and the such.

with about a dozen chickens.

to make the news less boring,

in your milkshake.

988

to be boring, Ron!

made this stupid bet!

Why can't we just tell them
what they want to hear?

999
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,356
And what do they
want to hear, Ron?

1000
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,990

country God ever created.

00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:24,827
Freddie, I can't.

1381
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:28,864
Listen to me, Burgundy. This is
far from over, do you hear me?

1382
00:59:29,898 --> 00:59:31,766
I'll see you on the playground.

1383
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:36,103
Well.

1384
00:59:37,606 --> 00:59:39,007
This, uh,

1385
00:59:39,675 --> 00:59:41,208
meeting has been

1386
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:43,780
very productive.

1387
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,248
You can pick
me up at 8:00.

1388
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:50,117
Okay, I'm very confused
by what's going on here.

1389
00:59:51,019 --> 00:59:52,288
Get out!

1390
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:54,155
(ALL LAUGHING)

1391
01:00:02,731 --> 01:00:05,601
Oh, Ron. Ron, you are missing
some real high-quality

1392
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:07,335
Garfield laughs over here!

1393
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:10,373
I think our boss just raped me.

1394
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,375
What?

1395
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:15,110
I don't know what happened.
All a bit of a blur.

1396
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,813
There was hands

1397
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:19,248
and hair, and breath, and lips.

1398
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,750
There might have been other
people, I don't know.

1399
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:22,251
Sounds like she wants you.

1400
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,619
Hey, man. Women have
been all over me

1401
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:25,387
since we got crazy famous.

1402
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,023
Not to brag or anything,

1403
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,692
but I just gave
Florence Henderson crabs.

1404
01:00:29,693 --> 01:00:33,161
That is in no way a brag,
Brian. That's horrible.

1405
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:36,331
Hey, it's just doing something
beautiful, that two people do.

1406
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,900
Except one of them has
microscopic dust mites

1407
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:41,036
all over his penis and testicles.
RON: I'm just saying,

1408
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:44,139
the mom of <i>The Brady Bunch</i>
<i>had a fun time with you,</i>

1409
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:47,175
and then woke up the next day
and realized she had crabs.

1410
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:50,112
I gave her a whole
Brady Bunch of crabs.

1411
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:51,179
(LAUGHS) Sounds to me
like it's her fault

1412
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:52,849
for being a randy gal.

1413
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:54,217
I have a date!

1414
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:55,751
Brick has a date?

1415
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:56,853
Good for Brick!

1416
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,655
What's a date?

1417
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,922
A date is simply when two
people get together,

1418
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,190
do something social,
have a few drinks,

1419
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:03,393
yadda-yadda-yadda...

1420
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:04,661
Take their shirts off...

1421
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,396
(GROWLS)

1422
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,130
Oh, it's okay.
RON: No, it's a fun thing.

1423
01:01:08,132 --> 01:01:09,898
It's fun.
It's all right.

1424
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,135
Look. Don't worry, Brick,
we got your back, okay?

1425
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:16,204
First things first, we need to
get you a little protection.

1426
01:01:18,407 --> 01:01:19,775
RON: Oh!

1427
01:01:20,242 --> 01:01:22,144
There it is.

1428
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:25,081
Brian Fantana's glorious
cabinet of condoms.

1429
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:28,717
Oh, Brian, I know.
How about The Hooded Guest?

1430
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:30,284
I like the cut of your jib.

1431
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,789
RON: That one
is ultra-ribbed.

1432
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:36,391
It's like you're wearing an
armadillo shell on your privates.

1433
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:38,193
It takes two hours to get on.

1434
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,730
It's hooded.
She'll never see you coming.

1435
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:42,065
Oh, oh. Wait, wait, wait.

1436
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:43,465
You thinking what I'm thinking?

1437
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:45,007
"Lou Dobin's
Good Time Weiner Pouch."

1438
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,869
That's a good one.

1439
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:50,039
Dobin. Just a drifter who loves
to watch people have sex.

1440
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,708
They're made of denim,

1441
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,275
so they look better
after each washing.

1442
01:01:53,277 --> 01:01:55,010
Talk about a great ride.

1443
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:56,112
BRIAN: I think I have it.

1444
01:01:56,878 --> 01:01:58,047
Po' Boy Condom.

1445
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,215
It's a terrific condom.

1446
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,952
Although it does burn a bit because
it's covered in Cajun spices.

1447
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:05,987
It'll put a blister
on your po' boy.

1448
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,724
Brian, what's the nickname for your
penis whenever you wear a Po' Boy?

1449
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,192
Fat Tuesday.

1450
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:11,592
Wait a minute.
I've got it.

1451
01:02:13,228 --> 01:02:14,963
"The Rigid Ghost."
RON: Mmm.

1452
01:02:14,965 --> 01:02:17,766
Ah, it's the best damn
rubber on the market.

1453
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:21,503
Hah, I got four of my seven illegitimate
children using this condom.

1454
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:24,206
Uh, but, Brian, isn't that the
whole point of wearing a condom?

1455
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:26,342
To not impregnate the woman?

1456
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:28,943
Well, you know the old
expression. "Nope."

There's no map, it's just green.

No, there's a map there.
Look at the monitor.

Where are my legs?
Your legs are there.

I don't have any legs, Ron.

I don't even know
how I'm standing up.

01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:28,371
You're so impressive, and I've...

I've only been out of
the United States twice.

God, yes.

1487
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:41,570
Did I scare you
by coming on so strong?

1488
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:44,186
A little bit, sure.

1489
01:03:44,188 --> 01:03:46,188
Look, it's not that
you're not attractive...

1490
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:48,356
It's just I'm a little
old-fashioned.

1491
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:50,958
Well, I am a modern woman.
Mmm.

1492
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,594
And let me tell you,

1493
01:03:52,596 --> 01:03:55,297
when I see something
that I want, I go for it.

1494
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,365
Can I ask you a question?

1495
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:58,867
Mmm-hmm.

1496
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:01,036
Is that your foot

No.

Oh. I'm sorry.

1499
01:04:05,173 --> 01:04:06,608
It was my hand.

We're going to do this,
aren't we?

We most definitely
are gonna do this.

1503
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:17,186
I feel a little awkward,
because I'm...

I sometimes lose control

Well, I don't mind,

to have you tonight.

Of course.

01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:48,376
Then, yes. I have kissed
Angie Dickinson and Dr. Zaius.

1526
01:05:50,045 --> 01:05:52,315
I've only kissed people
in my dreams.

1531
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:05,293
Always get your teeth involved.

01:07:39,454 --> 01:07:42,358
You seem a little quiet,
I must say.

1550
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:44,693
Just so you know,
I'm absolutely fine

1551
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,114
with going to this family dinner.

1552
01:07:46,494 --> 01:07:47,929
They're going to love you.

1553
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:51,266
Mmm. This is delicious!

1554
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:54,235
So...

1555
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,838
How long have you
and Linda been dating?

1556
01:07:56,838 --> 01:07:57,840
Mother.
(CHUCKLING)

1557
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,442
Oh.

1558
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:01,309
No, it's all right.
It's a logical question.

1559
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:03,311
Um...

1560
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:07,215
Ours is a new love,
but it burns very brightly.

1561
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:12,387
And it gets hot
and sweaty and stanky.

1562
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:15,257
There's some stank on that love.

1563
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:16,826
What... What are you
talking about?

1564
01:08:16,827 --> 01:08:19,694
Let's put it this way, I be
busting nuts like a squirrel.

1565
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:22,331
Oh, now, we don't have conversations
like that over dinner.

1566
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:22,331
(WHISPERING) What are you doing?

1567
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:26,234
I'm addressing the white
elephant in the room.

1568
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:27,636
I'm breaking down the barriers

1569
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:29,738
of race by assimilation.

1570
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,739
That's all I'm doing.
Well, you're coming off like a jerk.

1571
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,742
I think it's going well.

1572
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:35,277
LINDA'S FATHER: (CLEARS THROAT)
If you haven't noticed,

1573
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,545
we don't converse like that.

1574
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,814
Okay, okay.

1575
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:41,117
Look at big papa down here.

1576
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:43,618
He's saying to himself,
"Shit! Look at this honky.

1577
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:47,256
"Sittin' at my table, eatin' my food.
In my house? Touching my daughter?"

1578
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:48,623
I have.

1579
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,192
I have touched your daughter.
LINDA: Honey!

1580
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:52,293
We have done things, Papa.

1581
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,596
You ain't gonna like.
You ain't gonna like it none!

1582
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:56,698
Oh, my goodness!

1583
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:01,436
I mean, I'm just a guy
from Terre Haute, Indiana

1584
01:09:01,438 --> 01:09:06,408
with a big ol' dick and a fat wallet
and a spleef the size of a baby arm.

1585
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:08,543
Just looking for someone
who wants to smoke it.

1586
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:10,445
Let's get some smoke
going in this place, right?

1587
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:12,546
This ain't no <i>Super Fly.</i>
<i>What is your problem, man?</i>

1588
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,487
Linda, I don't understand
what you are doing with him.

1589
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,588
Oh, you know what
I'm comin' at you with,

1590
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:23,626
you big black mother of Linda.
Mix it up in a pot!

1591
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:26,395
Makin' it spicy!
Oh, my Lord.

1592
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:28,796
Hey.
In the back, cooking up chitlins.

1593
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:31,233
Big ol' titties.
Big ol' titties.

1594
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:32,935
Excuse me?

1595
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:34,636
That's my mama, man.
RON: Hey.

1596
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:36,905
Wave your hands in the air.

1597
01:09:36,907 --> 01:09:38,841
Wave your hands in the air
like you just don't care.

1598
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,676
Please, don't do this.

1599
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,279
Now, which one of you
pipe-hittin' bitches

1600
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,547
can pass me the mashed potatoes?
(ALL GASPING)

1601
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:47,382
RON: Oh, I don't think that
dinner could've gone any better.

1602
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:48,751
LINDA: (YELLING)
Are you nuts?

1603
01:09:48,752 --> 01:09:50,952
No, I'm not!
I had a wonderful evening!

1604
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,323
My dad was kicking you
in the head!

1605
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,792
I thought it was like
being jumped into a gang.

1606
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,661
Only with dinner guests!

1607
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:00,962
You called my family
"pipe-hittin' bitches!"

1608
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,863
I hate to pin it on you, but

1609
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,119
you did invite me to dinner.

1610
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,336
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1611
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:09,438
No, I'm sorry.
I just...

1612
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:12,408
I'm just under
a lot of stress because...

1613
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:14,475
Because Allenby, he
doesn't want you to do

1614
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:16,096
the story that
you're doing for sweeps.

1615
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:17,880
"Death From Above."

1616
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:19,347
It's an excellent story.
Wonderful expose.

1617
01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:20,881
Listen, Ron.

1618
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:23,984
Have you ever heard of synergy?

1619
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:32,661
So your mom thought
we should get together,

1620
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:34,362
spend a little time.

1621
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:38,800
She doesn't think I connect
with you as a child.

1622
01:10:40,668 --> 01:10:42,470
Can you believe that bullshit?
(SCOFFS)

1623
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,442
Oh! This is hard.

1624
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:49,377
Things you say
to a 6-year-old...

1625
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:53,448
Oh! Guess what?
I slept with a black woman.

1626
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:55,551
What?
Nothing.

1627
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:58,253
Dad, do you like Spider-Man?

1628
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:02,323
Nope. Don't care for him.
Never have.

1629
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:05,927
Don't like the mask, the costume,
the get-up, the webs.

1630
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:08,764
He comes off like a real dickhead.
Real poser.

1631
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,666
What's a poser?

1632
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:15,503
A poser is Gary.
That's what a poser is.

1633
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:17,338
By the way, how is that shitheel?

1634
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,542
What's a shitheel?

1635
01:11:18,873 --> 01:11:21,743
A shitheel is a real fun term

1636
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:24,380
that you should call Gary
every time you see him.

1637
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:27,850
When he wakes you up for breakfast,
say, "Good morning, shitheel."

1638
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:30,351
He'll probably give you
$5 or some candy.

1639
01:11:30,353 --> 01:11:32,387
Does that sound good?
Yeah.

1640
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:34,489
You're a shitheel, Dad.

1641
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:34,489
(LAUGHS) Good.

1642
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:39,662
You should just call Gary that.
'Cause it makes him really happy.

1643
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:42,029
It makes me sort of happy,
but it makes him really happy.

1644
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:44,966
Dad.
Huh?

1645
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,702
Sometimes I hear sounds at night

1646
01:11:46,703 --> 01:11:48,470
and I get scared.

1647
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,372
I think there's
a ghost in my closet.

1648
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:53,074
Now, you listen to me, son.

1649
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:57,313
There is no such thing
as ghosts. Case closed.

1650
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:58,881
So what's real that's scary?

1651
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:00,349
You really want to know

1652
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,930
the one thing
you should be afraid of?

1653
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:03,751
Yes, I really do.

1654
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,387
Voodoo.
Voodoo?

1655
01:12:06,389 --> 01:12:07,823
Yes, voodoo.

1656
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,824
That shit will mess you up.

1657
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:12,460
And it is 100% real.

1658
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,729
Promise me

1659
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,030
that you'll never go to Haiti.

1660
01:12:16,064 --> 01:12:18,067
I promise, Dad.

1661
01:12:18,068 --> 01:12:20,002
This was good. I enjoyed
spending time with you.

1662
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,804
Me, too, Dad.

1663
01:12:21,805 --> 01:12:23,805
Oh, and hey. Do you want
to go to Haiti sometime?

1664
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:26,007
No.
Good. Good.

1665
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:27,943
(YELLING) What did you tell him?

1666
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,912
I didn't tell him anything.

1667
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:32,547
He hasn't slept
for four days, Ron!

1668
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:35,050
Everywhere we go, he asks
me if we're going to Haiti!

1669
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:36,752
What does that even mean?

1670
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:39,654
I am so sick and tired
that you've sheltered him

1671
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,756
from the evils of voodoo.

1672
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:44,827
You need to learn to connect
with him in a healthy way!

1673
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:46,862
Let me ask you something, and I'm
not trying to be funny here.

1674
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:49,465
Are you sure he's not a midget
with a learning disability?

1675
01:12:49,466 --> 01:12:52,701
He is seven years old, Ron.

1676
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,502
All right.
<i>Now listen to me.</i>

1677
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,840
He has a science fair
tomorrow, at 8:00,

1678
01:12:57,841 --> 01:12:59,440
and he wants you to be there.

1679
01:12:59,442 --> 01:13:02,444
I will be there.
All right?

1680
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:03,878
Now, who do you have
for sweeps week?

1681
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,114
I'm not discussing
work with you, Ron, okay?

1682
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:08,583
Just be there
at the science fair tomorrow.

1683
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:09,649
Fine!

1684
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:13,154
<i>Well, they're calling it</i>
<i>the interview of the decade.</i>

1685
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,417
<i>Veronica Corningstone will</i>
<i>sit down with Yasser Arafat.</i>

1686
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:16,992
Yasser who?

1687
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:16,992
<i>The head of the PLO and some say</i>

1688
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:16,992
<i>the key to peace</i>
<i>in the Middle East.</i>

1689
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:23,966
<i>Of course, Ms. Corningstone is</i>
<i>the ex-wife of Ron Burgundy,</i>

1690
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:26,100
<i>so you know that's got to be</i>
<i>a little stinger for Ronny.</i>

1691
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:28,537
Tony Danza's scrotum!

1692
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,805
<i>Well, that'll do it</i>
<i>for all of us here at GNN.</i>

1693
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:33,775
<i>Thank God for the events,</i>
<i>thank me for the news.</i>

1694
01:13:33,777 --> 01:13:35,141
<i>I'm Dick Phuc.</i>

1695
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:42,917
We're going to get crushed
in ratings. Just crushed.

1696
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:45,421
I really thought we had
a chance this time.

1697
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,220
What about my
"Death From Above" story?

1698
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,158
You better ask Ron about that.

1699
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:54,095
We're pulling that story, Brian.

1700
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,931
What? Why?
I worked hard on that story.

1701
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:58,533
It was my call, all right, Brian?

1702
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,202
Just let it go.
It's synergy.

1703
01:14:00,203 --> 01:14:01,470
What does that mean?

1704
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,704
Take it easy, Ron.

1705
01:14:03,706 --> 01:14:05,807
We got further than anybody
thought we would.
We'll get 'em next time.

1706
01:14:05,809 --> 01:14:07,542
You take it easy!

1707
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:09,110
I'm not in this to finish second!

1708
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:10,979
I think Champ is just saying...

1709
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:14,550
I know what he was trying
to say, Brian, okay?

1710
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:17,185
And it doesn't surprise me
that you guys don't care.

1711
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,554
Let's face it, I'm the one
who gets the ratings.

1712
01:14:20,721 --> 01:14:22,822
I'm starting to wonder
what you clowns actually do.

1713
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,561
Chani likes clowns.

So, Ron, what do you do
with yourself all day?

1937
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,405
You're just out here pretty
much away from everything.

Well, every day begins
about the same.

1939
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:43,144

One time I bit hard
into a marble ashtray,

1947
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:00,761
thinking it was a savory waffle.

1948
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:05,432
I wanted that waffle so bad!
Completely shattered my teeth.

1949
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:07,668
Couldn't you tell the ashtray
wasn't hot like a waffle?

1950
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:10,471
No! I couldn't!
Because I'm blind!

Do you have any idea
what it's like

1954
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,681
to drink a half a bottle
of ketchup

1955
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:24,350
thinking it was a bottle of
1946 Chateauneuf-Du-Pape?

1956
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:27,488
I even decanted it!

1957
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:30,492
If you drank half a bottle
of that, that's like...

1958
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:32,527
That's like nine or ten gulps.

1959
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:33,761
I mean, you couldn't tell
that was ketchup?

wondering, "Where's the sensation?

"Where's the pleasure coming?"

RON: That should keep him in
there until he's strong enough

2053
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:42,475

2054

Seriously, you've got one of the
most vicious predators in the ocean,

2059
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,091
you're gonna name him "Crackers"?

something, don't be a dick about it.

2061

Why don't we do this?
Let's name him Doby.

2062

You talk all that smack and that's
the best name you come up with?

Well, we're not gonna get
any better than that.

2064
01:30:11,672 --> 01:30:16,144
I mean, you obviously can't name
him anything that sounds good.

a cut-off penis,
a TV star and a car chase.

2251
01:38:54,996 --> 01:38:56,095

Ron, are you okay?

You see, folks, I've read
a lot of news in my day,

2262
01:39:22,989 --> 01:39:26,359
but it's...
It's taken me until now

2263
01:39:27,328 --> 01:39:30,331
to realize what real news is.

2264
01:39:30,332 --> 01:39:33,300
Real news is supposed
to let people know

2265
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:37,537
what the powerful are up to, so that,
that power doesn't become corrupt.

2266
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:39,539
But what happens when
the powerful own the news?

2267
01:39:39,541 --> 01:39:42,141
Ugh! You piece of shit!

01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:44,511
Shit. He's blowing
the whole thing up.

2269
01:39:44,511 --> 01:39:47,514
Recently, I've been on a
bit of a personal journey.

2270
01:39:47,515 --> 01:39:51,283
I made love to a proud,
intelligent black woman.

2271
01:39:52,519 --> 01:39:55,055
I became blind.

2272
01:39:55,055 --> 01:39:57,658
I bottle-fed
and raised a shark.

2273
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:01,060
And I smoked
a fair amount of crack.

2274
01:40:01,061 --> 01:40:03,082
But the most important thing
I've learned is that

2275
01:40:03,262 --> 01:40:06,233
there was an emptiness left

2276
01:40:06,234 --> 01:40:09,333
after turning my back on three of the
best friends anyone could ever ask for.

2279

I'm going to see
my child's recital

2280
01:40:15,577 --> 01:40:19,177

that I still love her.

your own ego and your own hubris.

And before others
can forgive you,

2300
01:41:17,805 --> 01:41:19,266

to forgive yourself.

2565
01:54:44,978 --> 01:54:49,248
And now, before I join this
couple in holy matrimony,

2566
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:51,516
Brick and Chani
ask us to join them

2567
01:54:51,518 --> 01:54:53,284

I will never forget
the exact moment I saw you.

2575
01:55:14,975 --> 01:55:18,978
My pee-pee got all uncomfortable
in my pants, and I thought,

"Here comes the warm milkshake out
of the tip of my belly stick."
