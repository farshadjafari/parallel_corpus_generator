00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:36,000
DONNIE DARKO

2
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,000
( thunder rumbling )

3
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,319
## Under blue moon,
I saw you ##

4
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,840
## So soon
you'll take me ##

5
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,240
## Up in your arms,
too late to beg you ##

6
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,920
## Or cancel it
though I know it must be ##

7
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,240
## The killing time ##

8
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,039
## Unwillingly mine ##

9
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,479
## Fate ##

10
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,560
## Up against your will ##

11
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,360
## Through the thick
and thin ##

12
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:18,079
## He will wait until ##

13
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,639
## You give yourself
to him ##

14
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,360
( whirring )

15
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,360
## ln starlit nights
I saw you ##

16
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,199
## So cruelly
you kissed me ##

17
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,800
## Your lips
a magic world ##

18
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,240
## Your sky all hung
with jewels ##

19
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,719
## The killing moon ##

20
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,960
## Will come too soon ##

21
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,039
## Fate ##

22
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,120
## Up against your will ##

23
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,400
## Through the thick
and thin... ##

24
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,319
I'm voting
for Dukakis.

25
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,399
Well...

26
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,040
Maybe when you have children
of your own

27
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,839
who need braces
and you can't afford them

28
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,160
because half
of your husband's paycheck

29
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,079
goes to the Federal Government,
you'll regret that.

30
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,759
My husband's
paycheck?

31
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,120
( chuckles )

32
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,519
Anyway, I'm not going to squeeze
one out till I'm, like, 30.

33
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,639
Will you still be working
at the Yarn Barn?

34
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,079
I hear that's a great place
to raise children.

35
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,800
That's really funny.

36
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,399
No, I think a year
of partying is enough.

37
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,959
She'll be going
to Harvard next fall.

38
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,680
Mom, I haven't even
gotten in yet.

39
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,000
Do you honestly think
Michael Dukakis will provide

40
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,079
for this country till
you're ready to squeeze one out?

41
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,680
Yeah, I do.

42
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,720
- When can I squeeze one out?
- Not until 8th grade.

43
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,040
Excuse me?

44
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,439
Donnie, you're such
a dick.

45
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,399
Donnie:
Whoa, Elizabeth!

46
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,800
A little hostile there.

47
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,839
Maybe you should be
the one in therapy.

48
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Then Mom and Dad
can pay someone $200 an hour

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,639
to listen to your thoughts
so we don't have to.

50
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,839
Okay.
You want to tell Mom and Dad

51
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,439
why you stopped taking
your medication?

52
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,040
- You're such a fuck-ass!
- What?!

53
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,879
Please.

54
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,040
Did you just call me
a "fuck-ass"?

55
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,920
- Elizabeth, that's enough.
- You can go suck a fuck.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,360
Tell me, Elizabeth,
how does one suck a fuck?

57
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,159
- You want me to tell you?
- Tell me.

58
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,759
We will not have this
at the dinner table.

59
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,680
- Mother: Stop.
- Fuck.

60
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,879
What's a fuck-ass?

61
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,240
( brief laugh )

62
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,439
( quick knocking )

63
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm reading.
Get out of my room.

64
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,040
Where do you go at night?

65
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,680
Would you just get out
of my room?

66
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,480
Did you toilet paper
the Johnsons' house?

67
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,040
Is that what
you came in here to ask me?

68
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,240
No.

69
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,839
I stopped rolling houses
in the sixth grade, Mom.

70
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
What happened to my son?

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,800
I don't recognize
this person today.

72
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,360
Then why don't you start
taking the goddamn pills?

73
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,279
Bitch.

74
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,439
Our son just
called me a bitch.

75
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,240
You're not
a bitch.

76
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,959
You're bitchen,
but you're not a bitch.

77
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
I want to be a President
of the United States

78
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,360
who makes sure that
we never again do business

79
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,600
with a drug-running
Panamanian dictator.

80
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,199
- That we never again...
- Dukakis!

81
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,959
funnel aid to the Contras
through convicted drug dealers.

82
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,759
Son of a bitch.

83
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,279
Panama is a friendly country.

84
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,680
I went down and talked
to the President of Panama...

85
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,600
- Tell him, George!
- about cleaning up

86
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,680
their money laundering.
And Mr. Noriega was there,

87
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,639
but there was no evidence
at that time.

88
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,439
When the evidence was there,
we indicted him.

89
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,319
Gruff voice:
Wake up.

90
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,560
Voice:
I've been watching you.

91
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,159
Come closer.

92
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,159
Closer.

93
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,679
28 days...

94
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,320
six hours...

95
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,320
42 minutes...

96
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,919
1 2 seconds.

97
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,399
That is
when the world

98
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
will end.

99
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,639
Why?

100
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,200
( static buzz )

101
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,080
( car engine rumbles )

102
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,399
( crash )

103
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,840
( car alarms blaring )

104
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,200
( Elizabeth breathing )

105
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,440
Son?

106
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,639
Son.
Donnie Darko?

107
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,039
Donnie Darko.

108
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,480
What the heck's
going on here?

109
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,679
- Who is it?
- It's Eddie Darko's kid.

110
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sorry about this, Jim.
He's a neighborhood kid.

111
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,200
Guess he was
sleep-golfing?

112
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,639
( laughing )

113
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,480
Watch out
for that drool spot.

114
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,600
Jim:
Are you all right, son?

115
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,919
So, let's stay off
the links at night, okay?

116
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,320
Donnie:
I'm sorry, Dr. Fisher.

117
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,320
It won't happen again.

118
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,240
Dr. Fisher:
I hate kids.

119
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,759
Jim:
Let's golf.

120
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,759
( siren blast )

121
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,799
Firefighter:
Let's go, fire it up!

122
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,600
Woman:
Donnie, Donnie, Donnie!

123
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,519
What happened
to your house?

124
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,720
- No one's allowed.
- This is my house.

125
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,559
- I said--
- This is my house!

126
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,759
He's okay.

127
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,919
Reporter:
...Channel 6 News.

128
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,519
We have just arrived
on the scene...

129
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,559
Wait a minute.

130
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,879
Here's your brother.

131
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
It fell in your room.

132
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,440
Watch yourself
down there!

133
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,919
Ms. Darko,
I'm Bob Garland.

134
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,679
I'm with
the F.A.A.

135
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,759
- The what?!
- I'm with the F.A.A.

136
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,440
We'd like to speak to you
and your husband privately.

137
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,440
- In private?
- Please.

138
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,159
Rose:
All right.

139
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,639
And... here.

140
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,879
- You got it.
- All right.

141
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,600
We have arranged for you
to stay at a hotel.

142
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,360
Get some sleep and we will
take care of things here.

143
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,360
- Great.
- Thank you.

144
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,679
Eddie: Kids, come on,
we're going to a hotel.

145
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:31,000
They don't know
where it came from.

146
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,519
Firefighter #1 :
That's good! Right there.

147
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,360
Just leave it.

148
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,240
Firefighter #2: Yeah,
just tying it off right now.

149
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,240
Reporter: Local and national
transportation authorities

150
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,840
have begun
a nationwide search...

151
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,480
Frankie Feedler.

152
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,000
...despite the fact
that no airline will claim...

153
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,159
You remember him?

154
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,600
From high school.

155
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,519
Reporter: The F.A.A. remained
tight-lipped on the details

156
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,360
of the current situation.

157
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,720
He died.

158
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,840
Reporter: The engine,
which appears to have detached...

159
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,759
On his way to the prom.
Remember?

160
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,240
They said
he was doomed.

161
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,799
Jesus.

162
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,960
They could have said
the same thing about Donnie.

163
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,360
( TV news continues )

164
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,840
If it fell
from a plane,

165
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,799
then what happened
to the plane?

166
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,279
They don't know,
Samantha.

167
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,480
Rose: Mrs. Farmer will
bring you home after practice.

168
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,320
- Bye, Mommy!
- Bye, honey.

169
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,960
Rose:
Donnie, good luck.

170
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,639
Oh, my God!
Okay, tell me everything.

171
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,519
- I'm not allowed to talk about it.
- Oh, my God.

172
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
- Hi, Cherita.
- Shut up!

173
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,919
Darko cheats death!

174
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,080
You're like
a celebrity.

175
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,960
I've been calling you
a jillion times.

176
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,840
- Where you been?
- We stayed at a hotel.

177
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,960
My dad said he saw you
at the golf course.

178
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,879
You sleepwalking
again, buddy?

179
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,360
I don't want
to talk about it.

180
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,360
Boy #2:
And now that you're famous,

181
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,279
you gotta have
a smoke.

182
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,360
What happens if you tell
Mom and Dad about this, Sam?

183
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,000
You'll put Ariel
in the garbage disposal.

184
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,480
Goddamn right,
I will.

185
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,960
Schoolgirl:
So grotty.

186
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,159
Boy #1 : Hey, Cherita,
you want a cigarette?

187
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,879
- Chut up!
- Chut up!

188
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,480
Go back to China,
bitch!

189
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,919
Just leave her
alone.

190
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,440
Boy #1 :
That's some good shit, huh?

191
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,720
Donnie:
It's a fucking cigarette.

192
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,960
( tower bell rings )

193
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:28,399
## I wanted to be
with you alone ##

194
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,519
## And talk
about the weather ##

195
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,720
## But traditions
I can trace ##

196
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,120
## Against the child
in your face ##

197
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,720
## Won't escape
my attention ##

198
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,360
## You keep your distance
via the system of touch ##

199
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,679
## And gentle persuasion ##

200
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,159
## With one foot
in the past ##

201
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,480
## Nowjust how long
will it last? ##

202
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,399
## No, no, no ##

203
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,799
## Have you no ambition? ##

204
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,480
## You keep your distance
via the system of touch ##

205
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,359
## And gentle persuasion ##

206
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,680
## I'm lost in admiration ##

207
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
## Could I need you
this much? ##

208
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:19,640
## Oh, you're wasting
my time ##

209
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,559
## You're, just, just,
just wasting time ##

210
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:26,000
## Something happens
and I'm head over heels ##

211
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,559
## I never find out ##

212
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,279
## Till I'm head over heels ##

213
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,279
## Something happens,
and I'm head over heels ##

214
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:39,119
## Ah, don't take my heart,
don't break my heart ##

215
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,720
## Don't-- don't--
don't throw it away ##

216
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,960
## ln my mind's eye ##

217
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:10,599
## One little boy...
one little man ##

218
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,359
## Funny how... ##

219
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,079
## Time... ##

220
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,680
## Flies. ##

221
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,640
"There would be headlines
in the papers.

222
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,160
Even the grown-up gangs
who ran the betting

223
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,440
at the all-in wrestling

224
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,079
and the barrow-boys
would hear with respect

225
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,759
of how Old Misery's house
had been destroyed.

226
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,200
It was as though
this plan had been

227
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,680
with him all his life,
pondered through the seasons,

228
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,279
now in his 1 5th year
crystallized

229
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,200
with the pain of puberty."

230
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,440
What is Graham Greene
trying to communicate

231
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,440
with this passage?

232
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,640
Why did the children
break into Old Misery's house?

233
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:54,039
- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.

234
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:57,000
Joanie, if you had actually
read the short story,

235
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,920
which, at a whopping 1 3 pages
would have kept you up all night,

236
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,559
- you would know that the children...
- You suck.

237
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,319
...find a great deal
of money in the mattress,

238
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,599
but they burn it.

239
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,200
Donnie Darko,

240
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,799
perhaps with your recent brush
with mass destruction,

241
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,359
you can give us
your opinion.

242
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,440
They say it right
when they flood the house

243
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,079
and they tear it
to shreds,

244
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,359
that destruction
is a form of creation.

245
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,720
So the fact that they
burn the money is ironic.

246
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,519
Theyjust want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart.

247
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,440
They want to change things.

248
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,559
May we help you?

249
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,480
Yeah, I just registered

250
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,440
and they put me
in the wrong English class.

251
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,759
You look like
you belong here.

252
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,200
Where do I sit?

253
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,160
Sit next to the boy
you think is the cutest.

254
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,200
- ( students murmur )
- Quiet!

255
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,960
Let her choose.

256
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,839
Joanie, get up.

257
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,079
The construction guys
say it will take

258
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,960
about a week
to fix the roof.

259
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,559
That damned airline better not
fuck us on the shingle match.

260
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,240
They still don't know?

261
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,839
- Know what?
- Where it came from.

262
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,960
No. Apparently they can't
tell us what happened yet.

263
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,839
Something about...

264
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,759
a matching serial number
that got burned.

265
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:07,160
I had to sign a form saying
I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

266
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,720
So, we're not supposed
to tell anyone

267
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:14,799
- what nobody knows?
- Yeah.

268
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,640
But, you tell--

269
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,359
What's your doctor's name?

270
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,119
- Dr. Thurman, Dad.
- Yes.

271
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,559
You tell Dr. Thurman
whatever you want.

272
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,559
- Dad?
- What?

273
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
Dad!

274
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,440
No mail today.
Maybe tomorrow.

275
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,799
( whispering )

276
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,119
Well?
What did she say to you?

277
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,039
I made a new friend.

278
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,920
Real or imaginary?

279
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,720
Imaginary.

280
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,640
Would you like to talk
about this friend?

281
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,799
- Frank.
- Frank.

282
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,599
- What did Frank say?
- He said to follow him.

283
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,119
- Follow him? Where?
- Into the future.

284
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,680
And then what happens?

285
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,839
And then he said...

286
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,440
Then he said that the world
was coming to an end.

287
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,680
Do you think the world
is coming to an end?

288
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,680
No.

289
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:57,039
That's stupid.

290
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,519
Woman: For my entire life,
I was a victim of my own fear.

291
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,400
Love.

292
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,519
Woman: I was feeding
fear through food.

293
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,480
Fear.

294
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,920
And finally, I looked
in the mirror.

295
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,480
Notjust in the mirror...

296
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,799
I looked through
the mirror.

297
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,799
In that image,

298
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,720
I saw my ego reflection.

299
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,720
For two years,
I thought it was normal

300
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,160
for a 1 0-year-old
to wet the bed.

301
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,079
- We tried everything.
- Shh!

302
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,640
Teacher:
Quiet!

303
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,480
But the solution
was there all the time.

304
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,400
I'm not afraid anymore!

305
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,960
All over America,

306
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,400
people have come together
tojoin hands.

307
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,559
People who believe

308
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,759
that human life

309
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,480
is absolutely too important,

310
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,359
too valuable,

311
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,640
and too precious
to be controlled by fear.

312
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,160
Hello, my name
is Jim Cunningham.

313
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,119
And welcome
to "Controlling Fear."

314
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,720
Frank:
Wake up, Donnie.

315
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,039
"And the prince was led
into a world

316
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,519
of strange
and beautiful magic."

317
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:14,440
Girl: Hey, you guys,
guess what?!

318
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,160
I can't
believe this!

319
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,079
My mom said the school
is closed today

320
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,240
- because it's flooded.
- No way.

321
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,279
- Yeah.
- Holy shit!

322
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,200
That's the best news
I've ever heard!

323
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,079
Principal: My God, is this
ever going to stop?

324
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,039
Eventually,
yes it will.

325
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,160
But right now I got
1 2 classrooms full of water,

326
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,480
all coming from
a busted water main.

327
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:44,319
- What else?
- What else?!

328
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,599
Principal Cole,
I'll show you what else.

329
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,559
Security guard:
That's unbelievable.

330
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,200
That's solid bronze,
isn't it?

331
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,200
- Yep.
- How did this happen?

332
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,039
Beth's mom said
the boys' locker room

333
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,480
was flooded and they found
feces everywhere.

334
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,640
- What are feces?
- Baby mice.

335
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,519
Aw-ww...

336
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,559
Hey...

337
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,839
Has anyone ever told you
that you're sexy?

338
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,599
I like
your boobs.

339
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,160
Hey.

340
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,079
Hey.

341
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,119
School was cancelled.

342
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,440
Do you want
to walk me home?

343
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,720
Sure.

344
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not.

345
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,680
You should check
your backpack,

346
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
those guys love
to steal shit.

347
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,519
So, why did you
move here?

348
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,440
My parents
got a divorce.

349
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,960
My mom had to get a restraining
order against my stepdad.

350
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,319
- He has emotional problems.
- I have those, too.

351
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,079
What kind of emotional problems
does your dad have?

352
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,720
He stabbed my mom
four times in the chest.

353
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,480
Oh.

354
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:20,400
Did he go
tojail?

355
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,759
No, he fled.
They still can't find him.

356
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,880
But my mom and I
had to change our names.

357
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,319
And I thought "Gretchen Ross"
was really cool.

358
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:32,039
I was in jail once.
I mean...

359
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,960
I accidentally
burned down this house.

360
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,920
It was abandoned,
but still,

361
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,319
I got held back in school
and I can't drive until I'm 21 .

362
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,480
But I'm over
all of that.

363
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,240
I'm painting
and stuff.

364
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:47,559
Writing.
I want to be a writer

365
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,400
or maybe a painter,
or maybe both.

366
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,559
I'll write a book
and draw the pictures.

367
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,839
Then maybe people
will understand me.

368
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,839
I don't know,
change things.

369
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,839
"Donnie Darko"? What the hell
kind of name is that?

370
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,160
It's like some sort
of superhero or something.

371
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,440
What makes you think I'm not?

372
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,519
I should go.

373
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,480
For physics, Monnitoff is having
me write this essay...

374
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,000
"Greatest invention
ever to benefit mankind."

375
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,839
It's Monnitoff.
But that's easy.

376
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,640
Antiseptics.

377
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,880
The whole
sanitation thing.

378
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,799
Joseph Lister, 1 895.

379
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,119
Before antiseptics,
there was no sanitation,

380
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,000
especially
in medicine.

381
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,559
You mean, soap?

382
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,559
Well, I'm really glad
school was flooded today.

383
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,559
Why is that?

384
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,279
Because you and I would have
never had this conversation.

385
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,440
You're weird.

386
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,039
Sorry.

387
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:56,079
No, that was
a compliment.

388
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,559
Well, look...

389
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,200
you want to go
with me?

390
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,920
Where do you want
to go?

391
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,559
No, I mean, like,
"go" with me.

392
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,200
It's what
we call it here.

393
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,759
- "Going together."
- Sure.

394
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,200
Okay.
Where are you going?

395
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,519
I'm going home.

396
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,720
So stupid!

397
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:35,599
"Where are you going?"

398
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,720
I'd like to try
something new this time.

399
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,160
Have you ever been
hypnotized?

400
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,759
No.

401
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:03,519
And when I clap
my hands twice,

402
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,880
you will wake up.
Do you understand?

403
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,319
Yes.

404
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,400
So... tell me
about your week.

405
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,519
I met a girl.

406
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,880
What is her name?

407
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,319
Gretchen.

408
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,599
We're going together now.

409
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:28,400
Do you still think
about girls a lot?

410
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,680
Yeah.

411
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,079
How are things
going at school?

412
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,680
I think about
girls a lot.

413
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:41,000
I asked you about school,
Donnie.

414
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,680
I think about...

415
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,559
fucking a lot
during school.

416
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,119
What else do you think
about during school?

417
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,240
"Married With Children."

418
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,440
Do you think
about your family?

419
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,839
I just turn down the volume

420
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,440
and think about fucking
Christina Applegate.

421
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:01,079
I asked you about
your family, Donnie.

422
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,079
No.

423
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,799
I don't think about
fucking my family.

424
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,759
That's gross.

425
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,640
I'd like to hear
about your friend, Frank.

426
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,920
Principal:
Sam Bylen?

427
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,880
Ahem.

428
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,440
( writing on blackboard )

429
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,799
Donald Darko.

430
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,920
Principal:
Daye Dennis.

431
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,599
( toilet flushing )

432
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,599
Hey, you fuck!

433
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,079
Did you tell them that
I flooded the school?

434
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,880
I didn't say shit.

435
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,039
That's not what I heard.
They think I did it.

436
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,599
Yeah, well,
if you're innocent,

437
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,720
then you have nothing
to worry about, right?

438
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,559
Fuck you!
You know what I think?

439
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,279
( knife clicks )

440
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,039
I think you did it.

441
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,759
( Donnie coughing )

442
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,920
( coughing )

443
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:50,240
( rifleshot )

444
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,039
( rifleshot )

445
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,039
Ronald: Beer and pussy,
that's all I need.

446
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:58,279
Sean: We gotta
find ourselves a Smurfette.

447
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,720
Smurfette?

448
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,160
Mm-hmm.

449
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,799
Not some, like, tight-ass,
Middlesex chick, you know?

450
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,119
Like this cute little blonde,

451
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,319
that will get down
and dirty with the guys.

452
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,319
- Like Smurfette does.
- Donnie: Smurfette doesn't fuck.

453
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
( cocks rifle, fires )

454
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,000
Sean:
That's bullshit.

455
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,680
Smurfette fucks
all the other Smurfs.

456
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,279
Why do you think
Papa Smurf made her?

457
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:19,640
Because all the other Smurfs
were getting too horny.

458
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,039
No, no, no,
not "Vanity."

459
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,480
I heard he was
a homosexual.

460
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,920
Okay, well,
you know what?

461
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,359
Then, she fucks them
while Vanity watches. Okay?

462
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,119
What about
Papa Smurf?

463
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,440
He must get in
on the action.

464
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:33,079
Yeah, what he does,
he films the gang-bang.

465
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,799
Later on, he beats off
to the tape.

466
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,319
First of all,

467
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,559
Papa Smurf didn't
create Smurfette.

468
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:43,039
Gargamel did. She was sent
in as Gargamel's evil spy

469
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,599
with the intention
of destroying the Smurf village.

470
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,400
But the overwhelming
goodness

471
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,079
of the Smurf way of life
transformed her.

472
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,559
And as for the whole
gang-bang scenario,

473
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,000
( laughs )
itjust couldn't happen.

474
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:58,400
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have...

475
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,559
reproductive organs under
those little white pants.

476
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,319
That's what's
so illogical, you know,

477
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,279
about being a Smurf.

478
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:09,199
What's the point
of living...

479
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,599
if you don't
have a dick?

480
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,960
( sighs )
Damn it, Donnie.

481
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,880
Why do you gotta
get so smart on us?

482
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,239
- ( honking )
- Donnie: Grandma Death.

483
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,679
Woman:
Excuse me! Excuse me!

484
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,920
Please stay off the road,
Miss Sparrow.

485
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,400
If this happens again,

486
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,039
I am going to call
Social Services.

487
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,599
I hate that
Mrs. Farmer.

488
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,960
- Watch your step. That's it.
- She's such a fucking bitch.

489
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:36,559
- There you are, that's a girl.
- Donnie: Yeah.

490
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,519
- Ronald: How old is Grandma Death?
- Donnie: 1 01 .

491
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,440
She does the same thing
every day.

492
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,360
Just walks
back and forth

493
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,199
and back and forth
to the mailbox.

494
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,679
Nothing
ever in there.

495
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,760
Sean:
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

496
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,039
She goes--
she's going back to the box.

497
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,840
We may
still have mail.

498
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,599
- Ronald: Mail, mail, mail.
- Sean: Here it is.

499
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,320
- And...?
- This could be it.

500
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,639
Oh-hhh!

501
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:11,159
No dice, Grandma.
No, sorry. Sorry.

502
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,079
Someone ought
to write that bitch.

503
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,480
( loud whirring )

504
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:16,280
Reporter: Authorities
continued their search today

505
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,920
for a suspect in the Middlesex
Ridge School vandalism.

506
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,400
The private school has
asked for public donations

507
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,159
to help restore
its beloved mascot,

508
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:25,599
known only as "The Mongrel."
In other news--

509
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,280
Principal: ln cooperation
with the county police,

510
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,639
we have begun
an active investigation

511
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,880
into the cause
of the flooding.

512
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,440
And our suspects include
several of our own students--

513
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:43,519
Mrs. Farmer: I want
to know why this filth

514
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,360
is being taught
to our children.

515
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,079
Parent:
That's what I want to know.

516
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,159
( panting )

517
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,719
Kitty,
I would appreciate--

518
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,199
Man: Let her speak,
for God's sake!

519
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,280
- If you would wait--
- Dr. Cole,

520
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,159
not only am I a teacher,

521
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,719
but I am also a parent
of a Middlesex child.

522
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,239
Therefore I am
the only person here

523
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,159
who transcends
the parent-teacher bridge.

524
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,679
Frank:
Don't worry.

525
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,199
You got away with it.

526
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,719
I have in my hand

527
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,679
Graham Greene's
"The Destructors."

528
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,280
This short story

529
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,920
is part of my daughter's
English assignment.

530
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,599
Woman:
We're with you, Kitty!

531
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,719
In this story,
several children

532
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,679
destroy an elderly man's
house from inside out.

533
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,000
( thumps )

534
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,159
How can you do that?

535
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,639
( thumps )

536
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,079
And how do they do this?

537
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,719
They flood the house

538
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,639
by breaking through
a water main.

539
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,639
Frank:
I can do anything I want.

540
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,480
And so can you.

541
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,679
Parent: We pay good money
for this school.

542
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,719
- It's our children!
- ( applause )

543
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,800
And I think that this garbage
should be removed.

544
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,639
Excuse me.

545
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:20,480
What is the real issue here?
The P.T.A. doesn't ban books.

546
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:23,159
The P.T.A. is here
to acknowledge

547
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:26,480
that pornography is being
taught in our curriculum!

548
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:28,280
It's meant
to be ironic.

549
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,000
Excuse me. You need
to go back to grad school.

550
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,079
Why did you make me
flood the school?

551
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,440
They are in great danger.

552
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,960
- Woman: We have rights here!
- Kitty...

553
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,719
do you even know
who Graham Greene is?

554
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,119
I think we have
all seen "Bonanza."

555
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,599
- ( gasps )
- ( scattered applause )

556
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,480
Well...

557
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,960
- Good work, Kitty.
- while we are on other topics...

558
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,760
Where did you come from?

559
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,039
Do you believe
in time travel?

560
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,159
Samantha:
Who are you talking to?

561
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,880
I was just taking
my pills, Sam.

562
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,000
It is time
to breathe.

563
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:26,119
Both:
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.

564
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:28,239
Linda:
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.

565
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:33,239
So now let us begin Life Line
Exercise Number One.

566
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,800
Please press "Stop" now.

567
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,960
Mrs. Farmer:
As you can see,

568
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,840
the Life Line is divided

569
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,800
into two polar extremes.

570
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,320
Fear and love.

571
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,039
Fear is in the negative
energy spectrum.

572
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,039
And love is in the positive
energy spectrum.

573
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,039
No duh.

574
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,679
Excuse me?
"No duh..."

575
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,679
is a product offear.

576
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,519
Now, on each card

577
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,880
is a character dilemma

578
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,519
which applies
to the Life Line.

579
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,320
Please-- take this!

580
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,159
Thank you.

581
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,880
Please read each
character dilemma aloud,

582
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,920
and place an "X"

583
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,599
on the Life Line
in the appropriate place.

584
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,519
Cherita?

585
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,079
"Juanita has an important
math test today.

586
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:40,559
She has known about the test
for several weeks,

587
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,840
but has not studied.

588
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,119
In order to keep
from failing her class

589
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:48,039
Juanita decides
that she will

590
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,039
cheat on the math test."

591
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,440
Good, good.
Very good.

592
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,920
Mr. Darko.

593
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,159
"Ling Ling finds a wallet
on the ground filled with money.

594
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,639
She takes the wallet to the address
on the driver's license

595
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:12,400
but keeps the money inside
the wallet."

596
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,800
( scoffs )

597
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,199
I-l'm sorry, Mrs. Farmer.
I don't get this.

598
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,880
Just place an "X"
on the Life Line

599
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,199
in the appropriate place.

600
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,559
Donnie: No. I know what to do.
I just-- I don't get this.

601
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:24,440
You can't lump things
into two categories.

602
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,920
Things aren't that simple.

603
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,119
The Life Line is
divided that way.

604
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,480
Life isn't that simple.

605
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:32,840
I mean, who cares
if Ling Ling

606
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,119
returns the wallet
and keeps the money?

607
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,199
It has nothing to do
with either fear or love.

608
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,840
Fear and love are the deepest
of human emotions.

609
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,360
Okay. But you're
not listening to me.

610
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,480
There are other things that
need to be taken into account.

611
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:47,679
Like the whole spectrum
of human emotion.

612
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,719
You can'tjust lump everything
into these two categories

613
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,599
and then just deny
everything else.

614
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:54,639
If you don't complete
the assignment,

615
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,760
you'll get a zero
for the day.

616
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,239
Principal:
Donald...

617
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,280
Iet me preface this
by saying

618
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,719
that your lowa Test
scores are...

619
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,159
intimidating.

620
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:14,079
So...

621
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:16,079
Iet's go over
this again.

622
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:19,320
What exactly did you say
to Mrs. Farmer?

623
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:23,239
Mrs. Farmer:
I'll tell you what he said.

624
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,079
He asked me
to forcibly insert

625
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,320
the Life Line exercise card
into my anus!

626
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,599
( Eddie snickers, coughs )

627
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,960
Woman:
These are modern times.

628
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:37,920
My political attitudes
are forthright.

629
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,320
And if there's
a Vice-Presidential candidate

630
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,039
worthy of my vote,
it has to be Dan Quayle.

631
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,519
Mrs. Farmer: Nobody cares
about responsibility,

632
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,440
morality, family values.

633
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,159
Mm-hmm.

634
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,639
( sighs )

635
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,719
Kitty...

636
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,480
Excuse us, please.

637
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,199
They've suspended him
from afterschool activities

638
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,159
for the next six months.

639
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,559
Ever since
this jet engine fiasco,

640
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,920
I honestly don't know
what's gotten into him--

641
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,760
Rose, I'll tell you this
because our daughters

642
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,000
have been on the dance team
together for two years,

643
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:16,800
and I respect you
as a woman.

644
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,400
But after witnessing your son's
behavior this afternoon,

645
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,400
I have significant
doubts about your--

646
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,519
Our paths through life
must be righteous.

647
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:29,239
I urge you to go home
and look in the mirror,

648
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,079
and pray that your son doesn't
succumb to the path offear.

649
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,719
Elizabeth:
Wait. Do you remember

650
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,000
that weird gym teacher,
Mrs. Farmer?

651
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,920
Yeah. Okay, well,
my brother

652
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,239
told her to shove
a book up her ass today.

653
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,559
And then my parents just
bought him all this new shit.

654
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,119
Yeah, I know. I wish a jet engine
would fall in my room.

655
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:02,480
Frank:
I can show you the way.

656
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:05,719
( bells ringing )

657
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,239
- Donnie: Dr. Monnitoff?
- Donnie.

658
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,039
I know this is gonna sound
kind of weird,

659
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:23,039
but... do you know
anything about...

660
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,920
time travel?

661
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,440
Dr. Monnitoff: Ah, a wormhole with
an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

662
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,159
which is...

663
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,199
theoretically,
a wormhole in space

664
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,039
controlled by man.

665
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:42,360
So, according to Hawking,

666
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,559
a wormhole may be able
to provide a shortcut

667
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,679
forjumping between two distant
regions of space-time.

668
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,119
In order to travel back in time,
you have to have a big spaceship

669
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:54,159
or something that can travel
faster than the speed of light?

670
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,760
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find

671
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,239
one of these wormholes?

672
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,440
The basic principles
of time travel are there.

673
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:00,719
You've got your vessel
and your portal,

674
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,880
and your vessel could be
just about anything,

675
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,400
- most likely a spacecraft.
- Like a DeLorean?

676
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,119
Metal craft
of any kind.

677
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:09,039
You know, I love that movie,
the way they shot it.

678
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,440
It's so...

679
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:12,239
Iike futuristic,
you know?

680
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:15,519
Listen...

681
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,760
Don't tell anybody
that I gave you this.

682
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,280
The woman who wrote this
used to teach here.

683
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,599
She was a nun many years
before that, but...

684
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:26,320
then overnight,
she just--

685
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,679
she became this
entirely different person.

686
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,840
She up and left the church,
she wrote this book.

687
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,639
She started
teaching science,

688
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,239
right here in Middlesex.

689
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,199
"The Philosophy
of Time Travel."

690
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,840
Roberta Sparrow?

691
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,920
That's right.

692
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:47,519
( chuckles )
Come on.

693
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,559
Roberta Sparrow?

694
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:10,519
Roberta Sparrow.

695
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,039
"Grandma Death."

696
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:17,719
It's called "The Philosophy
of Time Travel."

697
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,239
What does philosophy
have to do with time travel?

698
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,360
- Let me see.
- Donnie: Guess who wrote it.

699
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,920
Who?

700
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,960
Roberta Sparrow?!

701
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,079
Huh. She wrote a book.

702
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,920
"Grandma Death"
wrote a book.

703
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,920
That's a terrible
nickname.

704
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,880
We almost hit her
with the car the other day.

705
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,519
She lives up there
in that piece of crap house

706
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:42,440
and you know
she's loaded. She's--

707
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:44,119
Eddie:
Yeah, you're right.

708
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,039
She used to be known
for her gem collection.

709
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,280
Kids...

710
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,639
used to go up there
all the time

711
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,559
and try to steal stuff
from her.

712
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:55,320
She became
a total recluse.

713
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,639
Huh-- I didn't even know
she was alive

714
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:01,199
till we damn near knocked
her down the other day.

715
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,880
Donnie:
She was just standing there

716
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,840
in the middle
of the road, frozen.

717
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,719
So I got out of the car

718
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,559
and I walked over to her
to see if she was okay.

719
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:15,039
And she leaned over
and whispered in my ear.

720
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,760
What did she say?

721
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,800
I think Frank wants me
to go talk to her,

722
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,599
because the last time
I saw him,

723
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:22,719
he asked me if I knew
about time travel.

724
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,599
She wrote a book
about it,

725
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:26,239
so that can't be
a coincidence, right?

726
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:31,440
Donnie, what did
Roberta Sparrow say to you?

727
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,119
She said that every living
creature on Earth dies alone.

728
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,760
How did that
make you feel?

729
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,119
It reminded me
of my dog, Callie.

730
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,239
She died
when I was eight,

731
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,559
and she crawled
underneath...

732
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:56,360
the porch.

733
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:00,880
To die?

734
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:05,199
To be alone.

735
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,880
Do you feel
alone right now?

736
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,599
I don't know.

737
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,519
I'd like to believe
I'm not, but I just--

738
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:24,599
I've just never
seen any proof, so l--

739
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:26,920
I just don't
debate it anymore, you know?

740
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,760
It's like I could
spend my whole life

741
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,599
debating it over and over again,
weighing the pros and cons,

742
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:34,079
and in the end, I still wouldn't
have any proof. So I just--

743
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:36,000
I just don't debate it
any more.

744
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:38,440
( laughs )
It's absurd.

745
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,199
The search for God
is absurd?

746
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:48,719
It is if everyone
dies alone.

747
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,480
Does that scare you?

748
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,039
I don't want
to be alone.

749
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,239
( classical music plays )

750
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:12,400
And so his tapes
have made me realize

751
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,679
that for the last
39 years,

752
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,320
I have been a prisoner
of my own fear.

753
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,320
Fear?

754
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,400
Rose, you have got
to meet this Jim Cunningham.

755
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,119
I can't believe
he's single.

756
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:29,039
Announcer #1 : And it has been
a disappointing night

757
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,079
indeed for these
Super Bowl champions.

758
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,920
Announcer #2:
You're right, Dan.

759
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,679
Coach Joe Gibbs
is on the sidelines,

760
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,159
water dripping off his glasses,
but he's gotta be thinking,

761
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:39,760
"What happened?
What went wrong tonight?"

762
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,199
And here's the kick...

763
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,880
( men groan )

764
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,159
And it's no good.

765
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:48,119
- Shit, we need a quarterback.
- And a miracle.

766
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,360
Ronald:
We need to go for a safety.

767
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,000
Announcer #1 : Mark Rypien
has some big shoes to fill,

768
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:55,320
that's for certain.

769
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,880
Announcer #2:
He sure does.

770
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,719
So what the future holds
for this Super Bowl M.V.P.

771
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,480
we're just gonna
have to wait and see.

772
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:05,800
( sighs )

773
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,480
- You guys want anything?
- Man: No.

774
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:09,880
Announcer #1 : Darrell Green again
with a display of amazing speed...

775
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,840
I'm gonna get a beer.

776
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,840
...deep into the end zone.

777
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,840
It's gonna be brought out
to the 20-yard line.

778
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,679
First down and 1 0.

779
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,639
Man: Good evening,
ladies and ghouls.

780
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:40,239
Join us at the Middlesex
Pavilion Mall

781
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,719
for the Middlesex
Halloween Haunt...

782
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,719
( man laughs )

783
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,519
( chuckles )

784
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:51,639
( airplane engine whines )

785
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,639
Gretchen: And what if
you could go back in time

786
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:10,079
and take all those hours
of pain and darkness

787
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:12,320
and replace them
with something better?

788
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,239
Like images, or what?

789
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,599
Yeah, like a Hawaiian sunset
or the Grand Canyon.

790
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:20,079
Things that remind you
of how beautiful the world--

791
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,039
We've been going together
for like, two weeks.

792
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:24,920
Yeah?

793
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:28,880
Well, l...

794
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,079
Do you want to kiss me?

795
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,800
- I-- I'm sorry.
- Look, Donnie, wait.

796
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,239
- I like you a lot.
- I just want it to be...

797
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,000
at a time when it...

798
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:50,880
When what?

799
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,119
When it
reminds me--just...

800
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:57,519
When it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be?

801
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:00,320
Yeah.

802
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,119
And right now there's some fat guy
over there staring at us.

803
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,119
Thank you for seeing us
at such late notice.

804
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:17,079
We both felt
that it was time

805
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:18,639
for us to come in
and discuss...

806
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,320
What I think is
going on with your son?

807
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,800
Yes.

808
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,880
Well, he's--

809
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,519
You know
about his past,

810
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,079
and he was suspended
from school

811
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:34,519
for insulting
his gym teacher.

812
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:36,440
I'm not really sure
that's a good example.

813
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:39,039
I think he had just cause
to insult her.

814
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,719
Rose, let me
just lay out

815
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,159
what I believe
is happening here.

816
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:48,440
Dr. Thurman:
Donnie's aggressive behavior...

817
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,639
his increased detachment
from reality,

818
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:57,519
seem to stem
from his inability to cope

819
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,920
with the forces in the world
he perceives to be threatening.

820
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,880
Has he ever told you
about his friend Frank?

821
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,199
Frank?

822
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,480
Yes, the giant
bunny rabbit.

823
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,119
The what?

824
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,559
I don't recall...

825
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:29,440
him ever having
mentioned a rabbit.

826
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:32,119
Donnie is experiencing
what is commonly called

827
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:34,119
a daylight hallucination.

828
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,119
( thumping )

829
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:41,599
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

830
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,559
What can we do?

831
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,639
I would like to...

832
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:49,400
do more hypnotherapy,

833
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:53,920
and increase his medication.

834
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,920
( grunts )

835
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,840
( thunderclap )

836
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,639
Rose:
Whatever will help him, really,

837
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,960
because that's why
we're here.

838
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:09,320
We just would like him
to experience some...

839
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,280
relief.

840
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,920
So if you think that
more medication will do that,

841
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:20,119
then I think we should
give it a try.

842
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:21,719
( tower bell rings )

843
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:22,480
( tower bell rings )

844
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,840
Donnie Darko.

845
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,400
I know.

846
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,039
( both laughing )

847
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,760
( applause )

848
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:48,719
Good morning,
you mongrels!

849
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,039
Good morning.

850
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:51,760
Is that all the gusto
you can muster?

851
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,079
I said, "Good morning!"

852
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:55,599
Good morning!

853
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:57,440
Now that's a tiny,
tiny bit better.

854
00:54:57,519 --> 00:54:59,960
But I can still sense
some students out there

855
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:03,079
who are actually afraid
to say, "Good morning!"

856
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:06,320
- Good morning!
- Yeah, that's what I like to hear!

857
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,440
Because entirely too many
young men and women today

858
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:12,679
are completely paralyzed
by their fears.

859
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,639
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation

860
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:20,559
and destruction of drugs,
alcohol, and premarital sex.

861
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,239
Now, I'm going to tell you
a little story today.

862
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,480
It's a heartbreakingly
sad story

863
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:29,519
about a young man

864
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,719
whose life was
completely destroyed

865
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,880
by these instruments
offear.

866
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,760
A young man,

867
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,960
searching for love
in all the wrong places.

868
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,559
His name was Frank.

869
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,280
Hi, my stepsister...

870
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,039
Iike, I sometimes worry
that she eats too much.

871
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,440
- Shut up, Kim!
- Sweetheart, please.

872
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:55,440
How can I decide what I want
to be when I grow up?

873
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:56,760
That's a hard one.

874
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,000
( feedback squeals )

875
00:55:58,039 --> 00:55:59,960
What do I do
to learn how to fight?

876
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,239
"What do I do
to learn how to fight?"

877
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,079
Son, violence is
a product offear.

878
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:08,840
Learn to truly love
yourself.

879
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,119
- Okay.
- Okay, get yourself up here.

880
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:13,880
- Okay.
- Jim: All right.

881
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:19,079
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

882
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:21,039
Um...

883
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,639
How much are they
paying you to be here?

884
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,519
Uh... excuse me?

885
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:29,199
Jim:
What is your name, son?

886
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,039
Gerald.

887
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,559
Well, Gerald,

888
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,119
I think you're afraid.

889
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:35,840
Are you telling us this stuff
so we can buy your book?

890
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,760
Because I got to tell you,
if you are,

891
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,679
that was some of the worst
advice I ever heard.

892
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:41,239
Jim: Do you see
how sad this is?

893
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,760
Do you want your sister
to lose weight?

894
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,519
Tell her to get off the couch,
stop eating Twinkies,

895
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:47,519
and maybe go out for field hockey.
You know what?

896
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,000
No one ever knows what they
want to be when they grow up.

897
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,679
It takes a little while
to find that out.

898
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,559
Right, Jim?
And you...

899
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:56,639
Yeah, you.

900
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:00,599
Sick of some jerk shoving
your head down the toilet?

901
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:02,760
Maybe you should
lift some weights

902
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,119
or take a karate lesson.
And the next time he tries to do it,

903
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:07,000
you kick him
in the balls.

904
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:09,159
( adults gasp;
students laugh )

905
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:11,119
( Jim chuckles )
Son. Do you see this?

906
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:13,320
- Right?
- This is an anger prisoner,

907
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,000
- Man: Remove him.
- Jim: A textbook example.

908
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:16,519
Do you see
the fear, people?

909
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,320
This boy is scared to death
of the truth.

910
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,360
Son, it breaks my heart
to say this,

911
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,800
but I believe you are a very
troubled and confused young man.

912
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,760
I believe you are searching for
the answers in all the wrong places.

913
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,360
You're right, actually.

914
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,679
I am pretty--
I'm pretty troubled

915
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,639
and I'm pretty confused,
but l--

916
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,480
and I'm afraid, really,
really afraid.

917
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:38,920
Really afraid.
But l--

918
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,880
I think you're
the fucking Antichrist.

919
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,800
( audience gasping )

920
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,599
Man: Get him out of here!
Who do you think you are?

921
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:49,039
( whistling; cheering )

922
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,639
It's amazing.

923
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,440
The man thinks
he's telling the truth,

924
00:57:56,519 --> 00:57:59,440
and everything he says
is just a fucking lie!

925
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:01,599
Everything he says!

926
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,960
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a fucking chud.

927
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:07,280
- Everything he does--
- Are you okay?

928
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,239
- Yeah.
- Sit down. Calm down.

929
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,079
You ever hear
of Grandma Death?

930
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:23,360
Who?

931
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,679
"The Philosophy
of Time Travel."

932
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:32,760
What is this?

933
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,280
She wrote it.

934
00:58:43,159 --> 00:58:45,199
I'm--

935
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:46,920
I've been seeing stuff.

936
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,599
Like, a lot of really
messed up stuff.

937
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,400
And there are chapters
in that book

938
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,119
that describe the stuff
I've been seeing.

939
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:56,159
It can'tjust be
a coincidence.

940
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:01,320
Dr. Monnitoff: Each vessel
travels along a vector...

941
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,159
through space-time,
along its center of gravity.

942
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:05,719
Like a spear.

943
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,280
I beg your pardon?

944
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,960
Like a spear
that comes out of your chest.

945
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:13,559
Umm... sure.

946
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:17,119
And in order for the vessel
to travel through time,

947
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:20,079
it's got to find a portal,
or in this case a wormhole--

948
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:22,039
Could these portals--

949
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:26,119
Could these portals
just appear anywhere, anytime?

950
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:28,199
I think that's
highly unlikely.

951
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,119
No, I think what you're
talking about is...

952
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:31,519
an act of God.

953
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,960
If God controls time,
then all time is pre-decided.

954
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,559
I'm not following you.

955
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,000
Every living thing
follows along a set path.

956
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:43,239
And if you could see
your path or channel,

957
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,400
then you could see
into the future, right?

958
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,559
Like... that's
a form of time travel.

959
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:51,159
Well, you're
contradicting yourself.

960
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:52,880
If we were able to see

961
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,320
our destinies manifest
themselves visually,

962
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,360
then we would be
given a choice

963
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,679
to betray
our chosen destinies.

964
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,360
And the mere fact
that this choice exists,

965
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,599
would make all pre-formed
destiny come to an end.

966
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:07,360
Not if you travel
within God's channel.

967
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,719
Um...

968
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,800
I'm not going to be able
to continue this conversation.

969
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:20,679
- Why?
- I could lose myjob.

970
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,960
Okay.

971
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,480
( chuckles )

972
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:17,679
Frank:
Now you know where he lives.

973
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,360
Dr. Thurman: And they grow
out of our chest...

974
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,280
solar plexus?

975
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,320
Donnie: Just like she
described in the book,

976
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,639
the way they moved
and they smelled.

977
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:30,320
It's like--
Iike they're workers.

978
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,719
Assigned to each one of us.

979
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,239
Theyjust--
they're like liquid.

980
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:39,880
I followed it...

981
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,480
into my parents' bedroom.

982
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:44,079
What did you find?

983
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,719
Nothing.

984
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,320
Donnie:
So we call them IMGs.

985
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,679
Gretchen:
lnfant Memory Generators.

986
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,639
The idea is that you buy
these glasses for your infant,

987
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:04,559
and they wear them
at night when they sleep.

988
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,920
Gretchen: But inside the glasses
are these slide photographs.

989
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,400
And each photograph is of something
peaceful or beautiful...

990
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,920
whatever the parents
want to put inside.

991
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,440
And what effect do you think
this would have on an infant?

992
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:19,639
Well...

993
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:21,480
the thing is, nobody
remembers their infancy.

994
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:23,800
Anyone who says
they do is lying.

995
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,199
So we think this will help develop
memory earlier in life.

996
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:27,639
Yeah.

997
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:30,039
Did you stop and think that maybe
infants need darkness?

998
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:32,960
That maybe darkness is part
of their natural development?

999
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:38,360
- Gretchen: No.
- Mm-mm.

1000
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,079
( snaps fingers )

1001
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,519
Yeah.

1002
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:45,079
What if the parents
put in pictures of Satan?

1003
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:47,039
Or, like, dead people?
Crap like that.

1004
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:49,480
Is that what you'd
show your kids?

1005
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,920
Well, I mean...

1006
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,960
didn't your dad, like,
stab your mom?

1007
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,000
( screeches )

1008
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,800
Get out.

1009
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,000
( class bell rings )

1010
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,760
Gretchen!
I'm sorry, Gretchen.

1011
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,079
Gretchen,
I'm sorry about those guys.

1012
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:14,400
They're fucking--

1013
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:41,840
Two for "Evil Dead,"
please.

1014
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,239
That'll be $2.

1015
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,920
( slow pounding )

1016
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,599
Why do you wear
that stupid bunny suit?

1017
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:40,320
Why are you wearing
that stupid man suit?

1018
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,719
Take it off.

1019
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,440
What happened
to your eye?

1020
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:21,039
Frank:
I'm so sorry.

1021
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,880
Why do they
call you Frank?

1022
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,880
It is the name
of my father...

1023
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,239
and his father
before me.

1024
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,519
Frank?

1025
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,159
When's this going
to stop?

1026
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:51,719
You should already
know that.

1027
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,039
( giggles )

1028
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:57,280
I want you
to watch the movie screen.

1029
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,880
There's something
I want to show you.

1030
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:12,079
Have you ever
seen a portal?

1031
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,079
( bell ringing )

1032
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,440
Burn it to the ground.

1033
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:12,920
( music plays )

1034
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,280
Okay, now girls...

1035
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,599
I want you
to concentrate.

1036
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:49,320
Failure is not
an option.

1037
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,159
And Bethany, if you feel
the need to vomit up there...

1038
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:56,280
-just swallow it.
- Okay, Mom.

1039
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,840
Hey, you guys,
good luck out there.

1040
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:13,719
( rude whistling )

1041
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,800
Seth:
Get off the stage, Cherita!

1042
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,199
You suck!

1043
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,560
Principal:
Hold on.

1044
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,159
Now that was
really something.

1045
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,560
Thank you, Cherita Chen,
with "Autumn Angel."

1046
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,279
And now the moment we've
all been waiting for is here.

1047
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,159
It is my very distinct
pleasure

1048
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:47,880
to introduce to you...

1049
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,640
Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey,

1050
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,039
Samantha Darko,
Beth Farmer,

1051
01:08:52,119 --> 01:08:55,000
and Joanie James.
They are... "Sparkle Motion."

1052
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:01,520
## No-- no-- notorious...
Notorious ##

1053
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:08,000
## No-- no--
notorious ##

1054
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:20,560
## I can't read about it ##

1055
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,479
## Burns the skin
from your eyes ##

1056
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:29,359
## I'll do fine
without it ##

1057
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:33,319
## Here's one
you don't compromise ##

1058
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:38,880
## Lies come
hard in disguise ##

1059
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,279
## They need to fight it out,
not wild about it ##

1060
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,960
## Lay your seedyjudgments ##

1061
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,800
## Who says they're
part of our lives? ##

1062
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,399
## You own the money ##

1063
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,000
## You control the witness ##

1064
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:57,640
## I'll leave you lonely ##

1065
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,880
## Don't monkey
with my business ##

1066
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,960
## You pay the prophets ##

1067
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:04,560
## Tojustify your reasons ##

1068
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,760
## I heard your promise,
but I don't believe it ##

1069
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,560
## That's why
I've done it again... ##

1070
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:37,720
Girl:
All right, Sparkle Motion!

1071
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:36,720
( man screaming )

1072
01:11:43,239 --> 01:11:45,479
Gretchen:
How long was I asleep for?

1073
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,880
Whole movie.

1074
01:11:57,319 --> 01:11:58,840
Captain...

1075
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,600
Iooks like we've got
another room back here.

1076
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:03,520
TV Reporter:
The blaze was extinguished

1077
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,039
sometime after 8:00 last night.

1078
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:08,760
Firefighters discovered
what has been referred to

1079
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,159
as a "kiddie porn dungeon."

1080
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:13,600
Cunningham, who has become
a recent celebrity

1081
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,319
for his books
and motivational tapes,

1082
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,039
- was arrested early this morning...
- Oh, my God!

1083
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:20,600
...at Sarasota Heights Country Club.

1084
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,479
Arson has not
been ruled out

1085
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,199
as part of the cause
of the fire.

1086
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:27,880
A group of Cunning Vision
employees...

1087
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,800
Oh, my God.
Dad played golf with that guy.

1088
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,159
...vehemently denied
the alleged link

1089
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,319
to a child pornography
publishing circuit.

1090
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:36,119
In a vicious statement,

1091
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,880
Cunningham attacked the Middlesex
Fire Department officials,

1092
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,079
claiming a vast conspiracy.

1093
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:44,119
Principal: I'm sorry, Karen,
but we don't think the methods

1094
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,560
you've undertaken here
are appropriate.

1095
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,279
With all due respect, sir,
what exactly about my methods

1096
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:51,279
do you find
inappropriate?

1097
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,760
I don't have time to get
into a debate about this.

1098
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,840
I believe I've
made myself clear.

1099
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,479
You call this clarity?

1100
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,000
I don't think
that you have a clue

1101
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:04,279
what it's like to communicate
with these kids.

1102
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:08,119
And we are losing them
to apathy...

1103
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,199
to this prescribed nonsense.

1104
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:16,279
They are slipping away.

1105
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:19,079
I am sorry
that you have failed.

1106
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:23,199
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have another appointment.

1107
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,199
You can finish out the week.

1108
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,159
( screams )
Fuck!

1109
01:13:55,079 --> 01:13:56,720
Good afternoon.

1110
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,039
It gives me
great pleasure to announce

1111
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:01,239
that the Middlesex Ridge
School dance team

1112
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:03,279
has been invited to perform

1113
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:05,640
on Ed McMahon's
"Star Search '88"

1114
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,880
in Los Angeles, California.

1115
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,279
( silent )

1116
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,640
( doorbell rings )

1117
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:44,359
No, it was ridiculous.
I'll call you back.

1118
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:48,520
- Rose.
- Kitty.

1119
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,720
I'm sure you're aware
of the horrible allegations

1120
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,199
against Jim Cunningham.

1121
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:55,640
I know,
I saw it on TV.

1122
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,600
Something about a...
"kiddie porn dungeon."

1123
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,920
Please, please.
Don't use those words!

1124
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,680
It's obviously some kind
of conspiracy

1125
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,560
to destroy
an innocent man.

1126
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,439
I have taken it upon myself
to spearhead

1127
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:10,359
the Jim Cunningham
defense campaign.

1128
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:13,760
Rose...

1129
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,319
I have to appear at his arraignment
tomorrow morning.

1130
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:18,600
As you know, the girls
are scheduled to leave

1131
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,359
for Los Angeles
in the morning.

1132
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:23,119
As their coach,
I was the obvious choice

1133
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:24,760
to chaperone them
on their trip--

1134
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,319
But now...
you can't go.

1135
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,079
- Yes.
- Hmm.

1136
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:31,720
Believe me,
of all the other mothers,

1137
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,960
I would never dream
of asking you.

1138
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:36,520
But none of the other mothers
are available to go.

1139
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,000
I don't know, Kitty.

1140
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:44,119
It's a bad weekend.
Eddie's in New York.

1141
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,079
Rose!

1142
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,319
I don't know
if you realize

1143
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:52,199
what an opportunity
this is for our daughters!

1144
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:54,319
This has been
a dream of Samantha's

1145
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:56,760
and all of ours
for a long time.

1146
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,920
I made her lead dancer!

1147
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,520
Sometimes I doubt
your commitment

1148
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,479
to Sparkle Motion.

1149
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,039
Elizabeth will be
in charge.

1150
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:39,359
She'll drive you
to therapy.

1151
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:42,319
If you need anything,
you promise me

1152
01:16:42,359 --> 01:16:44,640
that you will call
Dr. Thurman?

1153
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:48,439
( softly )
Okay.

1154
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,520
How's it feel to have
a wacko for a son?

1155
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,520
It feels wonderful.

1156
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,439
So what do I tell the other kids
when they ask about you?

1157
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:52,159
Tell them that everything
is going to be just fine.

1158
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,520
What's "Cellar Door"?

1159
01:17:58,359 --> 01:18:00,199
This famous linguist
once said,

1160
01:18:00,279 --> 01:18:03,680
that of all the phrases
in the English language...

1161
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,159
of all the endless
combinations...

1162
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,079
of words
in all of history,

1163
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,880
that "cellar door"
is the most beautiful.

1164
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,479
Donnie:
"Cellar door"?

1165
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,000
I promise
that one day

1166
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:50,079
everything's going
to be better for you.

1167
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,279
Chut up!

1168
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:08,640
Dr. Thurman: I want to talk
about your past today.

1169
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,439
Donnie:
No.

1170
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,840
Dr. Thurman: I want to talk about...
you and your parents.

1171
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:15,199
Donnie:
They didn't buy me

1172
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,079
Donnie:
They didn't buy me

1173
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,600
what I wanted
for Christmas.

1174
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,640
What did you want
for Christmas that year?

1175
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,439
"Hungry, Hungry Hippos."

1176
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:28,760
How did you feel,

1177
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:31,720
being denied
these "Hungry, Hungry Hippos"?

1178
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,720
Regret.

1179
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,359
What else
makes you feel regret?

1180
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,600
That I did it again.

1181
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,560
You did it again?

1182
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:46,159
I flooded my school

1183
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:49,720
and I burned down
that pervert's house.

1184
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,640
( laughing )

1185
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,279
I only have a few days left
before they catch me.

1186
01:19:54,359 --> 01:19:56,720
Did Frank tell you
to do these things?

1187
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,600
I have to obey him.
He saved my life.

1188
01:20:01,239 --> 01:20:04,079
I have to obey him
or I'll be left all alone.

1189
01:20:04,119 --> 01:20:06,399
And then--

1190
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:08,479
and then I won't be able
to figure out

1191
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,439
what this is all about.

1192
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:13,960
I won't be able
to know his master plan.

1193
01:20:14,039 --> 01:20:17,560
Do you mean,
God's master plan?

1194
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,279
Do you now
believe in God?

1195
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:23,840
I have the power to build
a time machine.

1196
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,880
How is that possible?

1197
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:31,000
How is time travel
possible?

1198
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:32,760
Donnie?

1199
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,920
Time's up,
Frank said.

1200
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,159
When is this
going to happen?

1201
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:39,560
Soon.

1202
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,880
Soon.

1203
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:00,600
What is going to happen?

1204
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,399
Frank is going to kill.

1205
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:08,399
Who is he going to kill?

1206
01:21:12,199 --> 01:21:14,359
Who is he going to kill, Donnie?

1207
01:21:14,439 --> 01:21:15,960
I can see him right now!

1208
01:21:20,119 --> 01:21:22,680
The sky is going
to open up.

1209
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,720
If the sky were
to suddenly open up,

1210
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,199
there would be no law.
There would be no rule.

1211
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:38,159
There would only be you
and your memories--

1212
01:21:38,199 --> 01:21:40,760
the choices you've made,

1213
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,960
and the people
you've touched.

1214
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,800
If this world were to end,

1215
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,840
there would only be you...

1216
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,840
and him...

1217
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,800
and no one else.

1218
01:22:28,039 --> 01:22:30,479
Hey.

1219
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,239
Elizabeth:
I got in.

1220
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,119
I'm going to Harvard.

1221
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:42,399
We should totally
throw a party.

1222
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:44,399
I mean,
Mom and Dad are gone.

1223
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:47,239
It's Halloween Carnival.
We could get away with it.

1224
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:51,119
Okay, but it has to be
small, all right?

1225
01:22:51,159 --> 01:22:53,680
- What do you guys got?
- Nothing good.

1226
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,960
Kid:
Happy Halloween!

1227
01:22:59,319 --> 01:23:01,159
( rock music playing )

1228
01:23:11,479 --> 01:23:14,960
( doorbell rings )

1229
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,560
We got eggs,
water balloons

1230
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,479
and a dozen rolls
of toilet paper.

1231
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,720
I stole four beers
from my dad.

1232
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,199
- Well, we got a keg.
- Keg beer is for pussies.

1233
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,399
( phone ringing )

1234
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:47,720
( beep tone )

1235
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,439
Rose, this is Lilian Thurman.

1236
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,880
It is extremely important
that you call me

1237
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,560
as soon as you get
this message.

1238
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,079
Thank you.

1239
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,279
- Hi.
- Hey.

1240
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,359
Are you okay?

1241
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,359
Yeah, my mom's gone.

1242
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:17,119
You want to come in?

1243
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,680
Yeah.

1244
01:24:21,399 --> 01:24:23,640
( music plays louder )

1245
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,439
I don't know, she...

1246
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,279
she didn't leave a note

1247
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:46,960
and the house
was all messed up.

1248
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,239
But you're okay?

1249
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,520
Did you call the cops?

1250
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,640
Yeah, they said I should
leave the house

1251
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:00,119
and that I should go
to a safe place.

1252
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,560
I'm just so scared.

1253
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,479
I keep thinking
something awful

1254
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:08,399
is happening, and...

1255
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:11,479
it's my fucking stepdad,
I know it.

1256
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:22,920
I guess some people
are just born

1257
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
with tragedy
in their blood.

1258
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,680
Hey, have you guys
seen Frank?

1259
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,680
No, I think they were going
on a beer run.

1260
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,000
- Shit.
- ( phone ringing )

1261
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:35,960
( beep tone )

1262
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,039
Rose: lf you're there,
please pick up.

1263
01:25:38,119 --> 01:25:40,039
Oh, well.
Good news.

1264
01:25:40,119 --> 01:25:41,960
The girls, they got
three and a half stars,

1265
01:25:42,039 --> 01:25:44,239
and they get to come back
for the quarterfinals.

1266
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:47,960
It was amazing.
Anyway...

1267
01:25:48,039 --> 01:25:51,199
we're going to take the red-eye
back tonight, and we ought to arrive--

1268
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:52,880
Samantha: Mom--
the plane's about to leave.

1269
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,800
Okay, okay. We'll take
the red-eye back tonight.

1270
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,920
We should arrive around
8:30 in the morning.

1271
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I hope everything's
all right.

1272
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:04,680
I love you. Bye.

1273
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,560
## ...no private
consultation ##

1274
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,239
## Under the Milky Way
tonight ##

1275
01:26:15,479 --> 01:26:20,039
## Wish I knew
what you were looking for ##

1276
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:25,960
## Might have known
what you would find ##

1277
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,319
## And it's something
quite peculiar ##

1278
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:39,319
## Something shimmering
and white ##

1279
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:44,279
## It leads you here ##

1280
01:26:44,359 --> 01:26:47,920
## Despite
your destination ##

1281
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:52,439
## Under the Milky Way
tonight ##

1282
01:26:55,960 --> 01:27:00,159
## Wish I knew
what you were looking for ##

1283
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,960
## Might have known
what you would find ##

1284
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:14,479
## Wish I knew
what you were looking for ##

1285
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:19,560
## Might have known
what you would find ##

1286
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:47,000
Karen's voice:
"...the cellar door..."

1287
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:54,000
## And it's something
quite peculiar... ##

1288
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:56,760
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

1289
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,439
- Donnie.
- Look, we gotta go.

1290
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,319
- Where?
- You ever see Grandma Death?

1291
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:04,159
Why, is this about the book?

1292
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:05,680
- No, it's Frank.
- Ronald: Donnie--

1293
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,640
Time is running out!
We gotta go.

1294
01:28:37,399 --> 01:28:39,920
Donnie:
Roberta Sparrow.

1295
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:43,319
Grandma Death.

1296
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:54,800
Sean: Donnie, nobody's here.
Let's just forget about it.

1297
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,840
Huh--
"Cellar door."

1298
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,399
What?

1299
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:39,880
( sustained low note )

1300
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,840
( brief keystroke )

1301
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,399
Oh, my God!
Donnie! Donnie!

1302
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:07,000
Donnie--!

1303
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:09,960
Why the fuck
are you here?!

1304
01:30:10,039 --> 01:30:11,399
Oh, my God!

1305
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,039
You're dead!

1306
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:17,239
What are we doing?

1307
01:30:17,319 --> 01:30:19,119
- Sean: Shit!
- Ronald: Leave him alone!

1308
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,760
Don't fucking move!
Don't fucking move!

1309
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,640
Fuck!

1310
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:36,560
- There's a car.
- ( coughing )

1311
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,359
Get the hell
out of here. Now!

1312
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,199
Ricky: Seth, there's
a car coming. Let's go!

1313
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:44,439
I have a bigger
knife now.

1314
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,159
Let's go!
He called the cops!

1315
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,079
Did you call
the fucking cops?!

1316
01:30:56,199 --> 01:30:58,760
- Deus ex machina.
- What did you just say?

1317
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,560
- What the fuck did you just say?
- Our savior.

1318
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,800
Donnie!

1319
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:19,199
( car engine sputters )

1320
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,319
Donnie:
Gretchen...?

1321
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:29,159
Gretchen...?

1322
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,520
Gretchen.

1323
01:31:36,279 --> 01:31:38,319
Wake up, Gretchen.

1324
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:40,800
- Frank...
- Wake up.

1325
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,720
What did you do?

1326
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,560
Donnie: Gretchen,
wake up. Wake up.

1327
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,399
Wake up.

1328
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,520
Gretchen...

1329
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,399
Gretchen...

1330
01:31:55,479 --> 01:31:57,840
"Clown": What the fuck
did you do, man?

1331
01:31:59,319 --> 01:32:01,159
You killed her,
Frank!

1332
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,239
Is she dead?

1333
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:16,880
What were you guys doing
in the middle of the road?!

1334
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:18,479
What are you thinking?!

1335
01:32:25,479 --> 01:32:28,000
Go home.

1336
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:30,359
Go home and tell your parents
everything will be okay.

1337
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:33,680
Go!

1338
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,079
( engine starts )

1339
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,199
( tires screeching )

1340
01:34:22,359 --> 01:34:24,640
( sirens blaring )

1341
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:37,000
Frank's voice:
28 days...

1342
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:40,079
Donnie's voice:
Six hours...

1343
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:43,640
42 minutes...

1344
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,960
1 2 seconds.

1345
01:34:49,319 --> 01:34:51,479
Frank: I'm going home.

1346
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:09,000
( Donnie chuckling )

1347
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:11,479
Donnie's voice: So in order
to travel back in time,

1348
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:13,880
you have to have a big spaceship
or something that can travel

1349
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,199
- faster than the speed of light?
- Dr. Monnitoff: Theoretically.

1350
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:18,039
And be able to find
one of these wormholes?

1351
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:20,079
Dr. Monnitoff: The basic principles
of time travel are there.

1352
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:22,399
You've got your vessel
and your portal.

1353
01:35:22,479 --> 01:35:24,239
And your vessel could be
just about anything,

1354
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:26,520
most likely a spacecraft.

1355
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,680
Metal craft of any kind.

1356
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:33,600
( loud bang )

1357
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,680
Gretchen's voice: What if you
could go back in time

1358
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:45,079
and take those hours
of pain and darkness

1359
01:35:45,159 --> 01:35:47,800
and replace them
with something better?

1360
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,439
Donnie's voice:
"Dear Roberta Sparrow,

1361
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:35,119
I've reached you
in your book,

1362
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:37,359
but there's so many things
I need to ask you.

1363
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:40,800
Sometimes I'm afraid
of what you might tell me.

1364
01:36:46,039 --> 01:36:47,640
Sometimes I'm afraid
that you'll tell me

1365
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,239
this is not a work
offiction.

1366
01:36:50,439 --> 01:36:53,199
I can only hope
that the answers

1367
01:36:53,239 --> 01:36:55,920
will come to me
in my sleep.

1368
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:58,159
I hope that when
the world comes to an end,

1369
01:36:58,199 --> 01:37:00,720
I can breathe
a sigh of relief,

1370
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:04,840
because there will be
so much to look forward to."

1371
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,840
( laughing )

1372
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,600
## All around me
are familiar faces ##

1373
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:53,600
## Worn out places ##

1374
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:56,840
## Worn out faces ##

1375
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:01,239
## Bright and early
for their daily races ##

1376
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:04,159
## Going nowhere ##

1377
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:07,800
## Going nowhere ##

1378
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:11,840
## Their tears are filling up
their glasses ##

1379
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:14,479
## No expression ##

1380
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,880
## No expression ##

1381
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:22,560
## Hide my head,
I want to drown my sorrow ##

1382
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:25,439
## No tomorrow ##

1383
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,039
## No tomorrow ##

1384
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:32,000
## And I find it kind offunny ##

1385
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:34,319
## I find it kind of sad ##

1386
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:36,760
## The dreams in which I'm dying ##

1387
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,359
## Are the best I've ever had ##

1388
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:42,680
## I find it hard to tell you ##

1389
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:45,079
## I find it hard to take ##

1390
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:47,560
## When people run in circles ##

1391
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:50,119
## It's a very, very... ##

1392
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:53,520
## Mad world ##

1393
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:58,720
## Mad world ##

1394
01:40:00,439 --> 01:40:04,760
## Children waiting
for the day they feel good ##

1395
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,760
## Happy birthday ##

1396
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:11,000
## Happy birthday ##

1397
01:40:11,039 --> 01:40:15,560
## Made to feel the way
that every child should ##

1398
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,840
## Sit and listen ##

1399
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:21,880
## Sit and listen ##

1400
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:26,079
## Went to school
and I was very nervous ##

1401
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:28,920
## No one knew me ##

1402
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,800
## No one knew me ##

1403
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:36,520
## Hello, teacher,

1404
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:39,279
## Look right through me ##

1405
01:40:39,319 --> 01:40:42,880
## Look right through me ##

1406
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,960
## And I find it kind offunny ##

1407
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:48,520
## I find it kind of sad ##

1408
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,159
## The dreams in which I'm dying ##

1409
01:40:51,239 --> 01:40:53,760
## Are the best I've ever had ##

1410
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,520
## I find it hard to tell you ##

1411
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,960
## I find it hard to take ##

1412
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,760
## When people run in circles ##

1413
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,560
## It's a very, very... ##

1414
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:07,279
## Mad world ##

1415
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:12,800
## Mad world ##

1416
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,079
## Enlarged in your world ##

1417
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:24,279
## Mad world. ##

1418
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:26,000

Horrible accident.

1421
01:41:30,279 --> 01:41:31,760
My neighbor...

1422
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,520

1427
01:41:50,359 --> 01:41:52,479
I feel bad

1431
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:33,039
Police radio:
...switch back to base.

1432
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:36,079
All units should be
back on base frequency.
