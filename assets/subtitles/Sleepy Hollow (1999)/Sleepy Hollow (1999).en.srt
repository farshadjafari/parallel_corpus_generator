1
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:58,872
Help here! Lend a hand here! Anyone!

2
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,292
Constable Crane?

3
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:04,211
Ichabod Crane, is that you?

4
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:05,629
None other.

5
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:07,631
Not only me.

6
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:11,635
I have found something,
which was lately a man.

7
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:17,850
- Burn it.
- Yes, sir.

8
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,937
Just a moment, if I may.
We do not yet know the cause of death.

9
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:25,524
When you find them in the river,
cause of death is drowning.

10
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:27,234
Possibly so,
if there is water in the lungs,

11
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:30,446
but by pathology we might be able to
determine whether or not he was dead

12
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,738
before he went into the river.

13
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:33,866
I will need to examine the body.

14
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,869
Cut him up. Are we heathens?

15
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:39,788
What happened to him?

16
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:42,124
Nothing, sir. Arrested for burglary.

17
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,258
Good work.

18
00:04:52,427 --> 00:04:54,595
The millennium is almost upon us.

19
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:58,515
In a few months,
we will be living in the 19th century,

20
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:02,060
yet our courts continue
to rely on medieval devices of torture.

21
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:03,228
Stand down!

22
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:06,398
I stand up for sense and justice.

23
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:08,692
Our jails overflow with men and women

24
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,861
convicted on confessions
worth no more than this one.

25
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:12,279
Constable Crane!

26
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:17,242
This is a song that we have heard
from you more than once.

27
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:21,079
Now, there are two courses open to me.

28
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:25,083
First, I can let you cool your heels
in the cells

29
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:28,253
until you learn respect
for the dignity of my office.

30
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:29,880
I beg pardon.

31
00:05:29,923 --> 00:05:33,550
But why am I the only one
who sees that, to solve crimes,

32
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:36,929
to detect the guilty,
we must use our brains

33
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:41,600
to recognize vital clues,
using up-to-date scientific techniques?

34
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:44,811
Which brings me to the second course.

35
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:49,525
There is a town upstate,
two days' journey to the north

36
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:51,527
in the Hudson Highlands.

37
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:55,364
It is a place called Sleepy Hollow.

38
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:57,783
Have you heard of it?

39
00:05:58,201 --> 00:05:59,284
I have not.

40
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:03,038
An isolated farming community,
mainly Dutch.

41
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:07,584
Three persons have been
murdered there, all within a fortnight.

42
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:12,464
Each one found
with the head lopped off.

43
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:13,966
Lopped off?

44
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:17,010
Clean as dandelion heads, apparently.

45
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:21,265
You will take
these experimentations of yours

46
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:23,141
to Sleepy Hollow

47
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:26,937
and there you will detect the murderer.

48
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,816
Bring him here to face our good justice.

49
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:33,569
Will you do this?

50
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:36,113
I shall.

51
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:40,158
Remember, it is you,

52
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:42,744
Ichabod Crane,

53
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:46,081
who is now put to the test.

54
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:53,263
"The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch

55
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:55,348
"Who's got a kiss for the Pickety Witch?

56
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:57,767
"The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch

57
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,645
"Who's got a kiss
for the Pickety Witch?"

58
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,149
Is it Theodore?

59
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,318
No, pardon, miss. I am only a stranger.

60
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,194
Then have a kiss on account.

61
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:18,997
I'm looking for Baltus Van Tassel.

62
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,750
I'm his daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.

63
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,419
And who are you, friend?
We have not heard your name yet.

64
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:26,922
I've not said it. Excuse me.

65
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:29,674
- You need some manners.
- Brom.

66
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,968
Come, come.
We'll have no raised voices.

67
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:34,846
It is only to raise spirits
during this dark time

68
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:39,017
that I and my dear wife
are giving this little party.

69
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:43,021
Young sir, you are most welcome,
even if you are selling something.

70
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:44,689
Thank you, sir.

71
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:48,109
I am Constable Ichabod Crane,
sent to you from New York

72
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:50,070
to investigate murder in Sleepy Hollow.

73
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:53,698
Then Sleepy Hollow
is grateful to you, Constable Crane.

74
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:56,826
And we hope you will honor us
by remaining in this house.

75
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:58,411
Well spoke, dear.

76
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:01,623
Come, sir, we'll get you settled. Play on!

77
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:10,048
Excuse me, please.

78
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:16,721
Thank you.

79
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:19,683
Please tell Mr. Van Tassel
I will be down in a moment.

80
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:20,976
I will, sir.

81
00:13:24,563 --> 00:13:26,398
Thank God you're here.

82
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:41,496
Excellent. Come in. Leave us, my dear.

83
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:48,753
We are joined by
Dr. Thomas Lancaster,

84
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:50,422
Reverend Steenwyck,

85
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:53,216
our able Magistrate Samuel Philipse,

86
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:54,384
and lastly,

87
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:58,722
this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook,
our notary.

88
00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:00,598
And you, sir?

89
00:14:00,683 --> 00:14:03,810
A simple farmer who has prospered.

90
00:14:03,894 --> 00:14:07,272
The town looks to me
as friend and counsel.

91
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,275
And landlord and banker.
Can we proceed?

92
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,443
Thank you.

93
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:14,863
So...

94
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:19,325
Three persons murdered.

95
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:23,830
First, Peter Van Garrett

96
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,459
and his son, Dirk Van Garrett.

97
00:14:28,544 --> 00:14:32,756
Both of them strong, capable men,

98
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,133
found together

99
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:37,677
decapitated.

100
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,891
One week later, the Widow Winship.

101
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:47,353
Also decapitated.

102
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,985
Now, I will need to ask you
many questions.

103
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,490
But first, let me ask,
is anyone suspected?

104
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:06,122
How much have your superiors
explained to you, Constable?

105
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:11,544
Only that the three
were slain in open ground,

106
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:15,673
their heads found severed
from their bodies.

107
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:18,510
Their heads were not found severed.

108
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:20,720
Their heads were not found at all.

109
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:26,810
The heads are gone?

110
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:28,061
Taken.

111
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:31,064
Taken by the Headless Horseman.

112
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:33,024
Taken back to hell.

113
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:36,027
Pardon, I don't...

114
00:15:36,112 --> 00:15:38,696
Perhaps you had better sit down.

115
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,367
Yes.

116
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:49,499
The horseman was
a Hessian mercenary

117
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:52,293
sent to these shores by German princes

118
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:55,296
to keep Americans
under the yoke of England.

119
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:59,425
But unlike his compatriots,
who came for money,

120
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:03,179
the horseman came for love of carnage.

121
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:07,016
When battle was joined,
there you'd find him.

122
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:13,314
He rode a giant black steed
named Daredevil.

123
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:19,404
He was infamous
for riding his horse hard into battle,

124
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:22,031
chopping off heads at full gallop.

125
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:25,702
He had filed his teeth
down to sharp points

126
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:28,413
to add to the ferocity of his appearance.

127
00:16:37,256 --> 00:16:40,466
This butcher didn't finally reach his end

128
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:43,094
until the winter of '79

129
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:48,266
not far from here in our Western Woods.

130
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:45,073
They chopped off his head
with his own sword.

131
00:17:45,157 --> 00:17:48,201
Even today,
the Western Woods is a haunted place

132
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:50,495
where brave men will not venture.

133
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:55,416
For what was planted
in the ground that day

134
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:58,461
was a seed of evil.

135
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:04,008
And so it has been for 20 years.

136
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:06,594
But now the Hessian wakes.

137
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:10,640
He's on the rampage,
cutting off heads where he finds them.

138
00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:17,814
Are you saying...

139
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,650
Is that what you believe?

140
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:24,445
Seeing is believing.

141
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:30,868
They tell me that you've brought books
and trappings of scientific investigation.

142
00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:35,456
This is the only book
I recommend you read.

143
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:44,716
I see.

144
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:48,386
Reverend Steenwyck.

145
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,221
Gentlemen.

146
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:55,143
Murder needs no ghosts
to come from the grave.

147
00:18:55,227 --> 00:18:59,522
We have murders in New York
without benefit of ghouls and goblins.

148
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:02,066
You're a long way
from New York, Constable.

149
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:05,862
The assassin is
a man of flesh and blood

150
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:07,739
and I will discover him.

151
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,156
Come out, devil.

152
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:44,168
His name's Gunpowder.

153
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:47,338
He should do just fine, Mr. Killian.

154
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:49,132
Thank you.

155
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:51,634
Good luck, sir.
If you need help, you call my name.

156
00:20:51,677 --> 00:20:53,136
Much appreciated.

157
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,097
Now, don't you worry about a thing.

158
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:58,307
Everything's going to be just fine.

159
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:02,937
Thomas! Inside!

160
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:06,524
Run along for your breakfast.

161
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,818
Kiss your mother
once for you and twice for me.

162
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:11,863
Murder! The horseman's killed again!

163
00:21:13,657 --> 00:21:16,409
All right, Gunpowder, we're off.
Come on.

164
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:18,453
No, no. Come on, the other way.

165
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:20,037
No, no. Turn around.

166
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:27,003
Good horsy.

167
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:42,518
- Mr. Miller, ride back for the coffin cart.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,896
The rest of you keep a sharp lookout.

169
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,858
It's all right. I'm here now.

170
00:22:13,926 --> 00:22:16,427
The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath.

171
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,098
I see.

172
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:24,143
And the head?

173
00:22:25,938 --> 00:22:29,023
Taken.

174
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:33,027
Interesting. Very interesting.

175
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:34,153
What is?

176
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,032
In headless-corpse cases of this sort,
the head is removed

177
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:39,909
to prevent identification of the body.

178
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:42,995
But we know
this was Jonathan Masbath.

179
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,456
Precisely. So why was
the head removed?

180
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:46,707
- Why?
- Right.

181
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:52,046
- You have moved the body?
- I did.

182
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,924
- You must never move the body!
- Why not?

183
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:56,342
Because.

184
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:13,317
The stride is gigantic.

185
00:23:16,113 --> 00:23:18,072
The attacker rode Masbath down,

186
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:20,783
turned his horse,

187
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,911
came back.

188
00:23:23,996 --> 00:23:25,913
Came back to claim the head.

189
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:44,932
Yes.

190
00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:47,977
There's a chemical reaction.

191
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,397
It shows there was a powerful,
singular thrust to the neck.

192
00:24:18,717 --> 00:24:21,010
- Interesting.
- What is it?

193
00:24:22,554 --> 00:24:25,097
The wound was cauterized
in the very instant,

194
00:24:26,892 --> 00:24:29,060
as though the blade itself were red hot.

195
00:24:29,144 --> 00:24:32,563
And yet, no blistering,
no scorched flesh.

196
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,275
The Devil's fire.

197
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:46,619
"Be vigilant,"
as it sayeth in the Book of Peter,

198
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:48,954
chapter five, verse eight.

199
00:24:49,748 --> 00:24:51,582
"Because your adversary the devil,

200
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:54,877
"as a roaring lion, walketh about,

201
00:24:55,796 --> 00:24:58,005
"seeking whom he may devour."

202
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:02,134
God rest Jonathan Masbath.

203
00:25:03,762 --> 00:25:05,137
Amen.

204
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:30,621
Mr. Constable, sir.

205
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,542
You're young Masbath.

206
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:38,295
I was young Masbath,
but now the only one.

207
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,381
Masbath, at your service.

208
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:42,800
In honor bound to avenge my father.

209
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:47,096
Well, one and only Masbath,
I thank you very much,

210
00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:50,015
but your mother will need you
more than I.

211
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:52,643
My mother is in heaven, sir.

212
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:55,938
She has my father now to care for her.

213
00:25:55,981 --> 00:26:00,401
But you have no one to serve you.
I am your man, sir.

214
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:04,155
Yes, and a brave one, too. But I cannot
be the one to look after you.

215
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:09,034
I'm sorry for your loss,
young Mr. Masbath.

216
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:23,924
- Constable Crane.
- Mr. Philipse?

217
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:25,718
Something you should know.

218
00:26:26,344 --> 00:26:29,054
Jonathan Masbath
was not the fourth victim,

219
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:32,433
- but the fifth.
- The fifth?

220
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:33,642
Aye.

221
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,063
Five victims in four graves.

222
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:51,035
Young Masbath.

223
00:26:51,787 --> 00:26:53,788
Find a place
in the Van Tassel's servants' quarters.

224
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:55,372
Wake me before dawn.

225
00:26:55,665 --> 00:26:57,750
I hope you have a strong stomach.

226
00:27:00,337 --> 00:27:01,754
Peter Van Garrett.

227
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,298
Dirk Van Garrett.

228
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,592
Jonathan Masbath.

229
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:11,180
There are five victims, four graves.

230
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:27,738
The Widow Winship.

231
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:53,848
Bring the Widow in.

232
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:58,435
This is most irregular, Constable.

233
00:27:58,478 --> 00:28:01,313
I should hope so, Doctor,
but in this case, necessary.

234
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:02,982
We need to operate immediately.

235
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:05,901
Operate? She's dead.

236
00:28:06,736 --> 00:28:07,945
When we say "operate,"

237
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:10,906
we mean, of course,
I will need the operating table.

238
00:28:14,411 --> 00:28:17,872
Once more, the neck wound cauterized.

239
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:23,669
The sword thrust to the stomach,
the same.

240
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:25,462
But to what purpose?

241
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:27,923
To what is your purpose
is the question.

242
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:31,635
What manner of instruments are these?

243
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,304
Some of my own design.

244
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,600
All right, then.
Step outside, young Masbath.

245
00:28:37,642 --> 00:28:39,685
Thank you very, very much
for your help, Mr. Killian.

246
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:42,062
And if you don't mind, Doctor,

247
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:45,441
my concentration suffers greatly
when I'm observed.

248
00:29:25,482 --> 00:29:26,732
I am finished.

249
00:29:26,942 --> 00:29:29,693
What in the name of God
have you done to her?

250
00:29:29,778 --> 00:29:32,237
We are dealing with a madman.

251
00:29:32,697 --> 00:29:34,698
What did you find out, Constable?

252
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:37,159
The Widow Winship was with child.

253
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:01,058
Ichabod.

254
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:05,604
Ichabod. Ichabod.

255
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:08,065
Ichabod.

256
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:24,415
Who's there?

257
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:37,988
Ichabod.

258
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,989
Oh, pardon my intrusion. I saw a light.

259
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:05,492
It is no intrusion.
I come here to read when I am wakeful.

260
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:13,584
To read books which you must hide?

261
00:33:13,668 --> 00:33:16,420
They were my mother's books.
My father believes

262
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:19,256
tales of romance caused the brain fever
that killed my mother.

263
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,592
She died two years ago
come midwinter.

264
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,469
The nurse who cared for her
during her sickness

265
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:26,180
is now Lady Van Tassel.

266
00:33:27,515 --> 00:33:29,433
There was something else, too.

267
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:31,643
Why did no one think to mention that

268
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:34,730
the Van Garretts are kith and kin
to the Van Tassels?

269
00:33:34,772 --> 00:33:37,316
Why, because there is hardly
a household in Sleepy Hollow

270
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,611
that is not connected
to every other by blood or marriage.

271
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,945
I see.

272
00:33:47,118 --> 00:33:49,661
This land we're looking at
was Van Garrett land,

273
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:52,497
given to my father
when I was in swaddling clothes.

274
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:55,083
The Van Garretts were
the richest family around these parts.

275
00:33:55,126 --> 00:33:57,252
When my father brought us
to Sleepy Hollow,

276
00:33:57,295 --> 00:34:00,214
Van Garrett set him up with an acre
and a broken-down cottage.

277
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:04,384
My father worked hard for his family,
and prospered and built this house.

278
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:06,470
And I owe my happiness to him.

279
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:09,932
I remember living poor in the cottage.

280
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:12,643
Should I show you?

281
00:34:13,353 --> 00:34:14,478
Yes.

282
00:34:17,565 --> 00:34:20,651
Take this. It is my gift for you.

283
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:23,195
No, I have no use for it.

284
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:25,364
Are you so certain of everything?

285
00:34:38,044 --> 00:34:39,169
It was your mother's.

286
00:34:39,254 --> 00:34:42,798
Keep it close to your heart.
It is sure protection against harm.

287
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,013
Are you so certain of everything?

288
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,907
These are strange.
These markings, what are they?

289
00:35:08,992 --> 00:35:11,159
I've had them since I can remember.

290
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:24,506
I used to play by this hearth as a child.

291
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:30,595
It was my first drawing school,

292
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,556
and my mother was my teacher.

293
00:35:35,226 --> 00:35:37,227
Oh, look. See?

294
00:35:37,312 --> 00:35:40,022
Carved into the fire back? The archer.

295
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:42,524
I'd forgotten it.

296
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,737
This was from long before
we lived here.

297
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:52,534
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

298
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:57,414
A cardinal. My favorite.

299
00:35:57,915 --> 00:36:01,793
I'd love to have a tame one, but
I wouldn't have the heart to cage him.

300
00:36:02,086 --> 00:36:05,797
Well, then I have something for you.

301
00:36:08,426 --> 00:36:11,887
Cardinal on one side. An empty cage.

302
00:36:12,764 --> 00:36:14,139
And now...

303
00:36:17,435 --> 00:36:19,853
You can do magic. Teach me.

304
00:36:19,937 --> 00:36:24,441
It is no magic. It is what we call optics.

305
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:27,819
Separate pictures
which become one in the spinning.

306
00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:31,531
It is truth,
but truth is not always appearance.

307
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:23,834
What are you running from,
Magistrate Philipse?

308
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:25,001
Damn you, Crane.

309
00:37:25,086 --> 00:37:27,170
- You had a mind to help me?
- Yes,

310
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:30,006
- and it's put me in mortal dread of...
- Of what?

311
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:32,801
Of powers against which
there is no defense. Come.

312
00:37:32,844 --> 00:37:35,011
How did you know the Widow Winship
was expecting a child?

313
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:36,304
She told me.

314
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:39,808
- Then I deduce you are the father.
- I'm not the father.

315
00:37:39,851 --> 00:37:42,018
Did she tell you
the name of the child's father?

316
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:44,104
Yes, she did.

317
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:46,773
She came to me for advice
as town magistrate

318
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:48,984
to protect the rights of her child.

319
00:37:49,026 --> 00:37:51,862
I was bound by my oath of office
to keep the secret, but...

320
00:37:51,946 --> 00:37:53,405
Do you believe the father killed her?

321
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:55,991
The Horseman killed her.

322
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:58,243
How often do I have to tell you?
There is no Horseman.

323
00:37:58,327 --> 00:38:01,371
Never was a Horseman,
and never will be a Horseman.

324
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:03,206
What is that thing?

325
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:05,792
My talisman.
It protects me from the Horseman.

326
00:38:05,877 --> 00:38:09,004
You, a magistrate,
and your head full of such nonsense.

327
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:10,881
Now, tell me the name of...

328
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:32,694
Oh, my God.

329
00:39:18,574 --> 00:39:21,618
Constable Crane? Constable Crane?

330
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:24,037
Has he not come out at all?

331
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:32,379
- It was a headless horseman.
- You must not excite yourself.

332
00:39:32,463 --> 00:39:33,588
But it was a headless horseman!

333
00:39:33,631 --> 00:39:35,549
Of course it was.
That's why you're here.

334
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:39,261
No, you must believe me. It was
a horseman, a dead one. Headless.

335
00:39:39,303 --> 00:39:40,428
I know. I know.

336
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:44,099
You don't know because
you were not there! It's all true.

337
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:47,102
Of course it is. I told you.
Everyone told you.

338
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:50,647
I saw him.

339
00:39:56,153 --> 00:39:58,488
I suppose it's back to the city, then.

340
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:25,241
All right, this time
I'll go to New York myself.

341
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:27,994
I won't be fobbed off
with an amateur deductor.

342
00:41:40,091 --> 00:41:42,384
This time, it's a magistrate
that's dead and...

343
00:41:42,426 --> 00:41:43,677
Gentlemen.

344
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:47,430
I need able men to go with me
into the Western Woods.

345
00:41:47,515 --> 00:41:50,809
You? We thought you'd shot your bolt.

346
00:41:50,893 --> 00:41:52,977
I have faced my fears,
and come out determined

347
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:54,646
to locate the Horseman's grave.

348
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:58,316
In short, to pit myself
against a murdering ghost.

349
00:42:00,611 --> 00:42:01,903
Who's with me?

350
00:42:05,032 --> 00:42:06,116
Me.

351
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:10,495
The Van Garretts, Widow Winship,

352
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:14,290
your father, Jonathan Masbath,
and now Philipse.

353
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:16,668
Something must connect them.

354
00:42:17,169 --> 00:42:19,838
Did your father
have dealings with the Van Garretts?

355
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:22,632
He worked for them.
We lived in the coach house.

356
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:25,510
It's nothing.

357
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,557
But there was something that happened
one night, a week before the murder.

358
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:33,768
An argument upstairs
between father and son.

359
00:42:33,811 --> 00:42:36,771
And my father was later sent for
by Mr. Van Garrett.

360
00:42:38,524 --> 00:42:41,317
An argument between father and son.

361
00:42:42,153 --> 00:42:45,655
After which the elder Van Garrett sent
for his servant Masbath.

362
00:42:46,282 --> 00:42:47,449
Listen.

363
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:50,827
- I hear nothing.
- Nor I.

364
00:42:51,912 --> 00:42:56,332
No birds. No crickets.
It's all gone so quiet.

365
00:43:05,176 --> 00:43:06,426
Quicken pace.

366
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,560
Pardon our intrusion,

367
00:43:57,603 --> 00:44:01,731
- but perhaps you could help us?
- You're from the Hollow.

368
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:04,984
Yes. In a way, yes.

369
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:12,575
I should like to say that I make
no assumptions about your occupation.

370
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:16,329
Nor your ways, which, which, which are

371
00:44:16,413 --> 00:44:18,414
nothing to me, whatever you are.

372
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,750
Each to his own.

373
00:44:24,463 --> 00:44:25,588
Oh.

374
00:44:31,262 --> 00:44:35,557
Do you know of the Horseman, ma'am?
The Hessian?

375
00:44:38,769 --> 00:44:40,353
That'll be him, ma'am.

376
00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:43,523
You, come with me.

377
00:44:44,441 --> 00:44:47,110
Go out, child. Keep away.

378
00:44:47,152 --> 00:44:49,445
Whatever you hear, keep away.

379
00:44:56,161 --> 00:44:58,872
What might he hear
that he must keep away from?

380
00:45:05,129 --> 00:45:08,590
He rides. To the Hollow and back.

381
00:45:08,632 --> 00:45:13,219
- I hear him. I smell the blood on him.
- Do you?

382
00:45:14,972 --> 00:45:19,684
Well, I'm here to find him
and make him stop.

383
00:45:26,817 --> 00:45:28,651
You seek knowledge
of the netherworld?

384
00:45:28,694 --> 00:45:29,944
I can show you.

385
00:45:39,038 --> 00:45:42,665
- What are you doing?
- Do not move or speak.

386
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:45,251
When the other comes, I will hold him.

387
00:45:45,336 --> 00:45:48,504
- The other?
- Silence. He comes now.

388
00:45:58,641 --> 00:45:59,724
Madam?

389
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:04,187
Madam, do you hear me?

390
00:46:16,742 --> 00:46:20,703
You seek the warrior bathed in blood,
the Headless Horseman.

391
00:46:20,788 --> 00:46:24,540
Follow the Indian trail
to where the sun dies.

392
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:26,626
Follow it to the Tree of the Dead.

393
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,380
Climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

394
00:46:37,721 --> 00:46:38,888
We're leaving.

395
00:46:38,931 --> 00:46:41,057
- What happened?
- We're leaving now.

396
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,645
We take the Indian trail
to the Tree of the Dead.

397
00:46:45,729 --> 00:46:48,898
- How will we recognize it?
- Without difficulty, I rather fear.

398
00:46:48,983 --> 00:46:51,359
We climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

399
00:46:51,402 --> 00:46:53,403
- His camp?
- His grave.

400
00:47:04,665 --> 00:47:06,249
Stay here.

401
00:47:43,787 --> 00:47:46,039
Halt and turn, I have a pistol aimed.

402
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:49,584
Katrina?

403
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,170
I might have killed you.
Why have you come?

404
00:47:52,254 --> 00:47:54,505
Because no one else would go with you.

405
00:47:55,591 --> 00:47:57,717
Well, then I am now twice the man.

406
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:00,845
It is your white magic.

407
00:48:04,933 --> 00:48:06,434
Pardon my intrusion.

408
00:48:06,477 --> 00:48:09,228
I think you'd better come
and look at this.

409
00:48:51,772 --> 00:48:54,023
The Tree of the Dead.

410
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:12,458
Blood.

411
00:49:15,337 --> 00:49:18,339
Stay where you are.

412
00:49:57,754 --> 00:50:02,341
- What is it?
- Just stay where you are. Don't move.

413
00:50:17,649 --> 00:50:22,111
This tree is a gateway.
A gateway between two worlds.

414
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:38,794
This ground has been disturbed.
The soil is loose.

415
00:50:38,879 --> 00:50:40,796
Bring the shovel.

416
00:50:58,398 --> 00:51:02,902
The skull is gone. Taken.

417
00:51:03,445 --> 00:51:06,155
That is why
the Horseman returns from the grave.

418
00:51:06,323 --> 00:51:10,493
To take heads
till his own is restored to him.

419
00:51:28,345 --> 00:51:30,346
Ichabod?

420
00:52:18,895 --> 00:52:22,064
Split up. Glenn. Theodore.

421
00:52:41,335 --> 00:52:44,587
Don't pick your teeth,
you'll teach Thomas bad habits.

422
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:49,008
- I am a bad habit. There's nothing for it.
- Oh, isn't there?

423
00:53:08,737 --> 00:53:12,114
- Come on, let's get ready for bed.
- Yes.

424
00:53:33,887 --> 00:53:36,222
Beth, run!

425
00:53:56,785 --> 00:53:58,786
Stay quiet.

426
00:56:43,618 --> 00:56:47,288
- Wait! He's not after you.
- I'll get him.

427
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:09,184
We cannot win this.

428
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:10,245
Remarkable.
A wound like this should've killed him.

429
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:13,582
But it needs no stitch,
and there's hardly a loss of blood.

430
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:18,712
You must be still. The fever is on you.

431
00:58:20,423 --> 00:58:21,799
Katrina.

432
00:58:22,217 --> 00:58:25,719
Nostradamus mediamus, milk of mercy,

433
00:58:26,096 --> 00:58:29,098
in media nos laudamas.

434
00:58:45,824 --> 00:58:49,660
Katrina, I tried to stop Brom, but...

435
00:58:50,662 --> 00:58:53,288
Drink this down. It'll make you sleep.

436
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:58,919
The Horseman was not set to kill Brom
or me. Had Brom not attacked him...

437
00:58:58,962 --> 00:59:00,629
Later. Rest now.

438
00:59:00,714 --> 00:59:04,508
I've discovered something.
The Horseman does not kill at random.

439
00:59:04,843 --> 00:59:07,720
His victims are chosen
by someone who controls him.

440
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:10,639
By that very person who took his skull.

441
00:59:11,474 --> 00:59:13,225
Someone who knew where to dig.

442
00:59:13,309 --> 00:59:16,603
Someone of flesh and blood,
as I've always said.

443
00:59:16,896 --> 00:59:20,232
- These are ravings.
- Drink.

444
00:59:53,933 --> 01:00:11,241
Ichabod.

445
01:00:32,138 --> 01:00:33,931
- You were dreaming.
- Yes.

446
01:00:35,391 --> 01:00:37,518
Things I had forgotten.

447
01:00:40,855 --> 01:00:44,817
- And would not like to remember.
- Tell me what you dreamt.

448
01:00:45,568 --> 01:00:48,862
My mother was an innocent.
A child of nature.

449
01:00:51,032 --> 01:00:53,075
Condemned.

450
01:00:54,077 --> 01:00:56,578
Murdered. By my father.

451
01:00:57,413 --> 01:01:00,249
- Murdered by...
- Murdered to save her soul

452
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:05,587
by a Bible-black tyrant
behind a mask of righteousness.

453
01:01:07,048 --> 01:01:10,300
I was seven when I lost my faith.

454
01:01:12,637 --> 01:01:14,388
What do you believe in?

455
01:01:14,931 --> 01:01:18,433
Sense and reason.
Cause and consequence.

456
01:01:21,312 --> 01:01:23,605
I should not have come to this place,

457
01:01:23,898 --> 01:01:27,442
where my rational mind has been
so controverted by the spirit world.

458
01:01:27,485 --> 01:01:29,111
Will you take nothing
from Sleepy Hollow

459
01:01:29,195 --> 01:01:31,154
that was worth the coming here?

460
01:01:33,491 --> 01:01:36,451
No. No, not nothing.

461
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,623
A kiss from a lovely young woman,

462
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:44,918
before she saw my face
or knew my name.

463
01:01:45,211 --> 01:01:48,422
Yes, without sense or reason.

464
01:01:52,218 --> 01:01:55,721
Forgive me, I speak of kisses

465
01:01:56,806 --> 01:01:59,141
and you've lost your brave man, Brom.

466
01:02:00,435 --> 01:02:04,980
I have shed my tears for Brom,
and yet my heart is not broken.

467
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:10,944
- Do you think me wicked?
- No.

468
01:02:12,697 --> 01:02:15,741
But perhaps there is a bit
of a witch in you, Katrina.

469
01:02:16,618 --> 01:02:20,704
- Why do you say that?
- Because you have bewitched me.

470
01:02:34,177 --> 01:02:35,177
Oh.

471
01:02:35,845 --> 01:02:39,514
- You slept like the dead.
- You're too kind to me.

472
01:02:40,058 --> 01:02:42,392
I do not look to be served
by the lady of the house.

473
01:02:42,477 --> 01:02:46,980
Nor would you be,
but that the servant girl has vanished.

474
01:02:47,023 --> 01:02:50,984
- Sarah?
- Run away like so many others.

475
01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:53,528
They're all leaving in fear.

476
01:02:55,198 --> 01:02:56,990
Where is Katrina?

477
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,787
She watched over you till dawn.
Now it is her turn to sleep.

478
01:03:07,752 --> 01:03:10,712
Well, I'm fit for another day, I think.

479
01:03:12,757 --> 01:03:15,592
Fit enough to face a mortal adversary.

480
01:03:17,595 --> 01:03:20,973
Doctor Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck,

481
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:29,022
Notary Hardenbrook,
and Magistrate Philipse.

482
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,527
Who tried to cut and run,
and lost his head.

483
01:03:34,445 --> 01:03:37,406
All frightened men,
arguing together on the very night

484
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:39,825
Magistrate Philipse was killed.

485
01:03:41,869 --> 01:03:44,079
There is conspiracy here.

486
01:03:48,334 --> 01:03:51,712
The doctor, the reverend, the notary

487
01:03:52,255 --> 01:03:54,047
and the magistrate.

488
01:03:55,925 --> 01:03:58,552
What is this secret that unites them?

489
01:04:01,889 --> 01:04:05,142
Magistrate Philipse knew
there were five bodies to four graves.

490
01:04:06,602 --> 01:04:08,979
He knew the Widow was pregnant.

491
01:04:09,939 --> 01:04:12,482
He would not tell me
the name of the father.

492
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,652
What does this point to?

493
01:04:23,036 --> 01:04:25,871
We must proceed
by a process of elimination.

494
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:29,332
I shall make a list of
every man and woman in Sleepy Hollow,

495
01:04:29,417 --> 01:04:32,878
starting with its chief citizen,
Baltus Van Tassel.

496
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,883
I feel we're getting very close.

497
01:04:37,967 --> 01:04:41,595
Yes, I suppose
Baltus is the chief citizen,

498
01:04:41,637 --> 01:04:43,722
now that old Van Garrett is dead.

499
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:48,727
Yes, the Van Garretts.
I'd almost forgotten them.

500
01:05:00,782 --> 01:05:02,157
Come with me.

501
01:05:02,283 --> 01:05:04,576
- Where?
- To Notary Hardenbrook's.

502
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:09,498
- Have you thought of something?
- Yes. I have.

503
01:05:24,806 --> 01:05:26,348
Hopeless.

504
01:05:35,233 --> 01:05:39,528
My father's satchel. Why is it here?

505
01:05:44,033 --> 01:05:45,867
- Leave me alone.
- Notary Hardenbrook.

506
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:47,869
Leave me alone!

507
01:05:47,954 --> 01:05:50,288
Just as soon as you show me
the last will and testament

508
01:05:50,373 --> 01:05:52,040
of old man Van Garrett.

509
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:55,043
The will leaves everything to his son.

510
01:05:55,086 --> 01:05:59,381
Who died with him.
So the estate passes to the next of kin.

511
01:05:59,465 --> 01:06:03,593
- Naturally. All legal and above board.
- Sir.

512
01:06:05,972 --> 01:06:08,765
I'm a dead man. No.

513
01:06:10,268 --> 01:06:13,228
Van Garrett's seal. Broken.

514
01:06:15,898 --> 01:06:18,817
Seems Van Garrett
made a new will just before he died.

515
01:06:18,901 --> 01:06:23,238
Naming Widow Winship?

516
01:06:23,364 --> 01:06:26,741
And here, look. A marriage certificate.

517
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:31,746
Old Van Garrett
secretly married the Widow.

518
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:34,791
Left everything to her
and her unborn child.

519
01:06:35,793 --> 01:06:38,962
So the new will
stood between the Van Garrett fortune

520
01:06:39,046 --> 01:06:42,090
and the person who would have
otherwise inherited everything.

521
01:06:42,133 --> 01:06:46,928
It's true. But we four were drawn in
against our will.

522
01:06:47,346 --> 01:06:49,681
- Your will?
- He means...

523
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:53,560
Of course. The four town elders.

524
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:56,938
Now I see what parts you had to play.

525
01:06:58,191 --> 01:07:01,610
Reverend Steenwyck knew the secret
because he performed the marriage.

526
01:07:01,652 --> 01:07:04,446
Dr. Lancaster attended
the pregnant woman.

527
01:07:04,864 --> 01:07:07,699
Magistrate Philipse
gave protection of the law.

528
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:10,619
And Notary Hardenbrook
concealed the documents,

529
01:07:10,995 --> 01:07:14,372
which had been entrusted
by Van Garrett to his faithful servant.

530
01:07:14,457 --> 01:07:17,292
The four conspirators
drawn into the plot.

531
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:20,795
We did not know
it was a murdering plot.

532
01:07:20,838 --> 01:07:22,881
But I have not finished, sir.

533
01:07:23,132 --> 01:07:26,468
First, the Van Garretts, father and son,
slain by a horseman

534
01:07:26,552 --> 01:07:28,511
raised from the grave to chop heads.

535
01:07:28,596 --> 01:07:32,474
Now, up pops a widow with a claim
on a fortune. Off with her head!

536
01:07:33,142 --> 01:07:35,310
But murder begets murder.

537
01:07:35,937 --> 01:07:39,147
It was the servant, Jonathan Masbath.

538
01:07:39,815 --> 01:07:42,817
The night father and son
quarreled over the new will,

539
01:07:42,985 --> 01:07:46,071
Jonathan Masbath was summoned
upstairs to bear witness.

540
01:07:46,906 --> 01:07:48,657
Here is his signature.

541
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:51,493
I'm afraid it was his death warrant,
young Masbath.

542
01:07:51,577 --> 01:07:53,912
The Horseman came for him.

543
01:07:55,164 --> 01:07:59,042
Came for him at the bidding of
someone who had power over him.

544
01:07:59,418 --> 01:08:02,629
Someone who dug in the earth in
the Western Woods and stole the skull.

545
01:08:02,672 --> 01:08:05,257
The missing head, which must
be restored to the Horseman

546
01:08:05,341 --> 01:08:07,259
before he will return to Hell.

547
01:08:07,468 --> 01:08:10,303
Someone who stood to gain
or lose a fortune.

548
01:08:10,805 --> 01:08:15,767
None other than Van Garrett's
next of kin, Baltus Van Tassel!

549
01:08:21,983 --> 01:08:26,861
- Katrina? Why are you in my room?
- Because it is yours.

550
01:08:30,574 --> 01:08:34,536
- Was it wicked of me?
- No. No, not at all.

551
01:08:36,414 --> 01:08:38,581
I missed you. Where did you go?

552
01:08:38,666 --> 01:08:41,668
To the notary.
I had questions to ask Hardenbrook.

553
01:08:42,044 --> 01:08:44,421
And did you learn anything of interest?

554
01:08:46,674 --> 01:08:48,049
Perhaps.

555
01:08:48,843 --> 01:08:50,885
- My father...
- Your father?

556
01:08:51,137 --> 01:08:55,056
Yes. My father thinks
you should return to New York.

557
01:08:55,182 --> 01:08:58,393
Really? Why is that?

558
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:00,729
I don't know.

559
01:09:01,063 --> 01:09:04,482
Perhaps he looked in your ledger
and did not like what he saw.

560
01:09:10,031 --> 01:09:14,075
- What have you there?
- Evidence. I'm sorry, I must ask you...

561
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,411
Then I'll leave you to your thoughts.

562
01:09:30,926 --> 01:09:35,388
- It's just a spider.
- Kill it! Kill it! No, no, stomp it!

563
01:09:37,683 --> 01:09:40,268
- There's something under here.
- What is it?

564
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:45,231
- Help me move the bed.
- No, no, I mustn't. You do it.

565
01:09:52,031 --> 01:09:56,868
The evil eye. It is someone
casting spells against you.

566
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:00,455
The evil eye?

567
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,133
Wait here.

568
01:12:08,584 --> 01:12:12,921
Katrina, you took the evidence

569
01:12:13,005 --> 01:12:14,047
and burned it.

570
01:12:14,089 --> 01:12:16,591
So you would not have it
to accuse my father.

571
01:12:16,675 --> 01:12:18,426
I accuse no one.

572
01:12:18,511 --> 01:12:20,386
But if there is guilt, I cannot alter it,

573
01:12:20,429 --> 01:12:21,971
no matter how much it grieves me.

574
01:12:22,056 --> 01:12:24,599
And no spells of yours
can alter it, either.

575
01:12:24,642 --> 01:12:26,142
Your father has the motive.

576
01:12:26,227 --> 01:12:28,436
It is he who stands to profit
from these murders.

577
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:32,106
If you knew him, you would not have
such harsh thoughts about him.

578
01:12:32,358 --> 01:12:34,400
No, nor if you felt anything for me.

579
01:12:34,443 --> 01:12:36,236
I am pinioned by a chain of reasoning.

580
01:12:36,278 --> 01:12:38,530
Why else did his four friends
conspire to conceal...

581
01:12:38,614 --> 01:12:40,448
You are the constable, not I.

582
01:12:40,491 --> 01:12:43,117
So find another chain of reasoning
and let me be.

583
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:48,081
I cannot, not the one or the other.
And I am heartsick with it.

584
01:12:48,415 --> 01:12:53,127
I think you have no heart.
And I had a mind once to give you mine.

585
01:12:54,088 --> 01:12:57,757
Yes, I think you loved me that day
when you followed me

586
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,802
into the Western Woods
to have braved such peril.

587
01:13:00,886 --> 01:13:02,178
What peril was there for me,

588
01:13:02,263 --> 01:13:05,640
if it was my own father who controlled
the Headless Horseman?

589
01:13:10,563 --> 01:13:12,021
Goodbye, Ichabod Crane.

590
01:13:12,106 --> 01:13:14,774
I curse the day
you came to Sleepy Hollow.

591
01:13:19,697 --> 01:13:24,284
- She will not see you.
- Did she say anything?

592
01:13:26,704 --> 01:13:29,038
Only that she will not come down.

593
01:13:30,165 --> 01:13:32,250
I see. Thank you.

594
01:13:32,501 --> 01:13:34,335
Constable?

595
01:13:35,754 --> 01:13:39,507
You have not asked me how
I have hurt my hand since yesterday,

596
01:13:40,467 --> 01:13:42,343
which would have been polite.

597
01:13:44,013 --> 01:13:46,347
In fact, you have been as careful

598
01:13:46,724 --> 01:13:50,602
not to look at it as not to mention it.

599
01:13:52,146 --> 01:13:54,731
Yes, I'm sorry. How did you...

600
01:13:54,815 --> 01:13:58,192
- I know you saw me.
- What?

601
01:13:58,944 --> 01:14:01,654
I know you followed last night.

602
01:14:02,072 --> 01:14:05,241
And you must promise
not to tell my husband what you saw.

603
01:14:05,618 --> 01:14:07,035
Promise me!

604
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:09,871
The town is in ferment.

605
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,166
Horror piled on tragedy.
Hardenbrook is dead.

606
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:17,003
- Oh, no! That harmless old man?
- Hanged himself in the night.

607
01:14:17,046 --> 01:14:18,212
Hanged himself?

608
01:14:18,297 --> 01:14:21,007
Reverend Steenwyck's
called a meeting in the church tonight.

609
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:24,636
Every man, woman, and child
is going to speak out against you.

610
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,555
If you are wise, you will leave this place.

611
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:33,061
- What is that?
- I was careless with the kitchen knife.

612
01:14:33,103 --> 01:14:34,854
The wound looks angry.

613
01:14:34,897 --> 01:14:38,399
I will bind it later
with wild arrowroot flowers.

614
01:14:38,484 --> 01:14:40,276
I know where some grow.

615
01:14:50,496 --> 01:14:53,790
Come on, hurry up.
The meeting bell started tolling.

616
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:19,607
The Horseman!

617
01:15:21,193 --> 01:15:22,527
- Katrina!
- Father?

618
01:15:22,611 --> 01:15:24,946
The Horseman! Save me!

619
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:30,118
He killed her.
The Horseman killed your stepmother.

620
01:15:39,128 --> 01:15:40,795
Oh, God!

621
01:15:52,349 --> 01:15:54,308
Fire!

622
01:16:10,826 --> 01:16:14,787
You'll kill us all!
You're the one the Horseman wants.

623
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:37,143
He cannot enter.

624
01:16:37,186 --> 01:16:38,811
Over here!

625
01:16:47,029 --> 01:16:48,029
The Horseman cannot enter.

626
01:16:48,113 --> 01:16:49,489
Why should we die for you?

627
01:16:49,531 --> 01:16:51,866
The Horseman cannot enter.
He cannot cross the gate.

628
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:54,202
We have to save ourselves.

629
01:16:55,412 --> 01:16:58,581
The next person that lays a hand on me
will get a bullet!

630
01:17:00,918 --> 01:17:02,543
He's coming back!

631
01:17:09,718 --> 01:17:12,804
Enough have died already.
It's time to confess our sins.

632
01:17:12,888 --> 01:17:16,265
- What is it that you know?
- Your four friends played you false.

633
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:18,810
We were devilishly possessed
by one who...

634
01:17:27,444 --> 01:17:31,405
Get out of my way!
Stand back! Stay back!

635
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:44,669
Back! Stand back!

636
01:17:49,174 --> 01:17:52,969
There is a conspiracy here,
and I will shake it out.

637
01:19:08,837 --> 01:19:11,047
It was an evil spirit possessed you.

638
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:15,217
I pray God it is satisfied now,
and that you find peace.

639
01:19:15,302 --> 01:19:17,178
The evil eye's done its work.

640
01:19:17,596 --> 01:19:22,308
My life is over, spared for
a lifetime of horrors in my sleep,

641
01:19:23,352 --> 01:19:25,353
waking each day to grief.

642
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:33,361
Goodbye, Katrina.

643
01:20:11,566 --> 01:20:15,736
- You think it was Katrina, don't you?
- That can never be uttered.

644
01:20:15,821 --> 01:20:19,240
A strange sort of witch,
with a kind and loving heart.

645
01:20:19,324 --> 01:20:21,826
- How can you think so?
- I have good reason.

646
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:25,204
- Then you are bewitched by reason.
- I am beaten down by it!

647
01:20:30,752 --> 01:20:32,253
It is a hard lesson for a hard world,

648
01:20:32,295 --> 01:20:34,463
and you had better learn it,
young Masbath.

649
01:20:34,548 --> 01:20:36,424
Villainy wears many masks.

650
01:20:36,591 --> 01:20:39,552
None so dangerous
as the mask of virtue.

651
01:20:47,644 --> 01:20:49,103
Farewell.

652
01:22:19,111 --> 01:22:20,653
- Van Ripper, turn the coach.
- What?

653
01:22:20,695 --> 01:22:22,238
Turn around now!

654
01:22:35,877 --> 01:22:37,378
Pardon my intrusion.

655
01:22:48,098 --> 01:22:51,892
No blood flow, no clotting, no healing.

656
01:22:54,813 --> 01:22:58,566
When this cut was made,
this woman was already dead.

657
01:23:09,161 --> 01:23:10,828
Dear stepdaughter,

658
01:23:13,123 --> 01:23:15,291
you look as if you'd seen a ghost.

659
01:23:46,907 --> 01:23:50,618
Rise up once more, my dark avenger.

660
01:23:50,869 --> 01:23:55,789
One more night of beheading.
Rise up with your sword.

661
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:59,793
A head for a head.

662
01:23:59,961 --> 01:24:02,880
My unholy horseman, rise!

663
01:24:03,715 --> 01:24:07,885
Come now for Katrina!

664
01:24:21,233 --> 01:24:23,150
Awake at last.

665
01:24:24,152 --> 01:24:27,071
Did you think it was all a nasty dream?

666
01:24:27,155 --> 01:24:29,240
Father saw the Horseman kill you.

667
01:24:29,658 --> 01:24:33,494
He saw the Horseman come
towards me with his sword unsheathed,

668
01:24:33,912 --> 01:24:37,331
but it is I who govern the Horseman,
my dear.

669
01:24:37,666 --> 01:24:40,167
And Baltus did not stay to watch.

670
01:24:44,673 --> 01:24:48,175
- But there was a body.
- The servant girl, Sarah.

671
01:24:48,218 --> 01:24:50,594
And I always thought she was useless.

672
01:24:54,057 --> 01:24:56,892
But it seems
she had a purpose after all.

673
01:25:02,148 --> 01:25:03,899
Who are you?

674
01:25:04,526 --> 01:25:09,405
- My family name was Archer.
- The archer.

675
01:25:16,246 --> 01:25:20,541
I lived with my father and mother
and sister in a cottage not far from here.

676
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:22,459
Until one day my father died,

677
01:25:22,544 --> 01:25:25,713
and the landlord, who had received
many years of loyal service

678
01:25:25,797 --> 01:25:27,840
from my parents, evicted us.

679
01:25:28,383 --> 01:25:31,051
No one in this God-fearing town
would take us in

680
01:25:31,136 --> 01:25:33,971
because my mother
was suspected of witchcraft.

681
01:25:34,723 --> 01:25:36,598
But she schooled her daughters well,

682
01:25:36,683 --> 01:25:39,852
while we lived as outcasts
in the Western Woods.

683
01:25:40,603 --> 01:25:43,188
She died within a year.

684
01:25:48,111 --> 01:25:52,948
My sister and I remained in our refuge,
seeing not a soul.

685
01:25:53,616 --> 01:25:57,619
Until one day, whilst gathering firewood,

686
01:25:57,704 --> 01:26:00,289
we crossed the path of the Hessian.

687
01:26:06,046 --> 01:26:07,880
I saw his death.

688
01:26:08,423 --> 01:26:12,343
At that moment,
I offered my soul to Satan,

689
01:26:12,427 --> 01:26:16,930
if he would raise the Hessian
from the grave to avenge me.

690
01:26:21,436 --> 01:26:24,271
- Avenge you?
- Against Van Garrett.

691
01:26:24,481 --> 01:26:27,691
The landlord who showed us no mercy
and left us to starve,

692
01:26:27,776 --> 01:26:31,612
whilst Baltus Van Tassel
and his simpering wife and girl child

693
01:26:31,654 --> 01:26:33,113
stole our home.

694
01:26:33,281 --> 01:26:36,408
I swore I would make myself
mistress of all he had.

695
01:26:36,451 --> 01:26:38,744
The easiest part was the first.

696
01:26:38,828 --> 01:26:41,497
To enter your house
as your mother's sick nurse,

697
01:26:41,581 --> 01:26:45,793
and put her body into the grave
and my own into the marriage bed.

698
01:26:46,211 --> 01:26:49,463
Not quite so easy
was to secure my legacy.

699
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:52,633
The Widow had to go, of course.

700
01:26:53,343 --> 01:26:55,177
And the servant, Masbath.

701
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:58,806
And then, just the other day,
that silly midwife Killian

702
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:02,267
told me the Widow had told her
a big secret.

703
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:05,479
And she told me this
right in front of her husband.

704
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:06,980
What a goose!

705
01:27:08,441 --> 01:27:10,734
So, another little job for the Horseman.

706
01:27:13,947 --> 01:27:18,867
But lust delivered
the Reverend Steenwyck into my power.

707
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:23,205
Fear did the same
for the notary, Hardenbrook,

708
01:27:23,289 --> 01:27:24,998
and the drunkard Philipse.

709
01:27:25,458 --> 01:27:28,127
And the doctor's silence I exchanged

710
01:27:28,169 --> 01:27:33,173
for my complicity in his fornications
with the servant girl, Sarah.

711
01:27:33,842 --> 01:27:37,428
- Yes, you have everything now.
- No.

712
01:27:37,846 --> 01:27:41,473
You have, my dear, by your father's will.

713
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:45,144
I get everything
in the event of your death.

714
01:27:46,938 --> 01:27:51,108
My sister, by the way,
sadly passed away.

715
01:27:53,903 --> 01:27:55,529
Quite recently.

716
01:27:57,866 --> 01:27:59,908
You killed your own sister?

717
01:28:00,034 --> 01:28:04,538
She brought it on herself
by helping you and your master.

718
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:09,710
You're just in time
to have your head cut off.

719
01:28:10,044 --> 01:28:14,381
The Horseman comes!
And tonight, he comes for you!

720
01:28:20,472 --> 01:28:21,847
Katrina!

721
01:28:28,104 --> 01:28:29,521
Thank God.

722
01:28:38,448 --> 01:28:40,407
Watch your head.

723
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:57,925
To the roof! I have an idea.

724
01:29:58,194 --> 01:29:59,820
Jump for the sails.

725
01:30:15,169 --> 01:30:16,420
Jump!

726
01:30:22,135 --> 01:30:23,218
Hurry!

727
01:30:43,531 --> 01:30:45,949
- Is he dead?
- That's the problem.

728
01:30:46,034 --> 01:30:47,743
He was dead to begin with.

729
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:12,893
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

730
01:31:26,699 --> 01:31:28,241
Here, take the reins.

731
01:31:48,596 --> 01:31:50,222
Ichabod!

732
01:32:45,987 --> 01:32:47,320
My bag!

733
01:33:04,922 --> 01:33:06,089
Jump!

734
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:11,446
- Still alive?
- Run, Katrina.

735
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:16,576
Yes, do run, and jump, and skip.

736
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:20,247
No!

737
01:34:28,965 --> 01:34:31,925
Here! Take her!

738
01:34:32,426 --> 01:34:34,761
She's yours!

739
01:34:37,473 --> 01:34:40,183
Sir, you're not dead.

740
01:35:21,726 --> 01:35:23,059
Horseman!

741
01:38:55,731 --> 01:38:58,024
Just in time for a new century.

742
01:39:10,996 --> 01:39:13,039
You'll soon get your bearings,
young Masbath.

743
01:39:13,082 --> 01:39:15,458
The Bronx is up, the Battery's down,

744
01:39:15,543 --> 01:39:18,543
and home is this way.
