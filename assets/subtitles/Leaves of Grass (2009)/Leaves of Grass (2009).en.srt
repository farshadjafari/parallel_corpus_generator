1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,347
The scene is Athens, 400 BC.

2
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:12,893
A bunch of the local braniacs have
gotten together, the wine is being passed,

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,900
and the ideas are flowing fast and furious.
The debate's in full force,

4
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,686
and Socrates has the floor.
Who enters? Alcibíades,

5
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:26,799
drunk, a beautiful man, hopelessly
in love with his mentor, Socrates.

6
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:29,971
And, uniquely, in all of
these dialogues,

7
00:00:30,357 --> 00:00:34,191
Socrates doesn't get the last word.
Alcibíades does. Why?

8
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,525
Because passion, Plato seems to be saying,
is essentially and mercilessly human.

9
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:44,717
And the best that we can
hope to do is to quell it,

10
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:46,818
through relentless discipline.

11
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:51,910
To Socrates, the healthy life is comprised
of constant focus by the individual,

12
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:57,776
to excise those forces that weaken
or... or confuse his

13
00:00:57,874 --> 00:00:58,974
understanding of the world
around him.

14
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:04,988
He implores us to devote our
lives to this kind of control.

15
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:07,981
Meaning, our every waking moment.

16
00:01:08,393 --> 00:01:13,324
Socrates recognized what
every philosopher

17
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:16,714
and religion, for that matter,
in the history of the world,

18
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:20,747
from Plato to Aristotle,
from Epicurus to the Stoics,

19
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:26,170
from the Judeo-Christians to
the Buddhists, have all observed,

20
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:31,100
which is that the balance
needed for a happy life

21
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:33,465
is illusory.

22
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:38,172
And as soon as in our
gorgeously-flawed human way

23
00:01:38,243 --> 00:01:40,997
we think that we've attained it.

24
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,064
We're pretending divinity,
and we're gonna crash,

25
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,577
like Icarus, flaming
into the sea.

26
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:52,516
So think about that this
weekend, when you think you're

27
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:54,717
on top of the world,
and then you pour a pitcher of beer

28
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:59,543
down your throat and chase that
upper-classman, who's out of your league.

29
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:04,999
Aristotle is next week.
Don't just look at it as words.

30
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:08,994
Imagine the scene. These were people.
They were alive, like you and me.

31
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:11,338
They thought these things.
Breathe 'em into life.

32
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:15,515
So, I was thinking about
doing a sort of contrast

33
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:18,416
between dialogue and
chorus in Sophocles.

34
00:02:18,427 --> 00:02:20,560
Now you should check out
Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy.

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,480
He says that tragedy emerges from
the clash between Apollo,

36
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,293
god of reason and harmony, and
Dionysus, god of intoxication.

37
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:32,992
And that their struggle within our
human condition is inevitable, and

38
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:36,706
that is what has produced the most salient
form of art the world's ever known.

39
00:02:36,794 --> 00:02:39,179
- Tragedy?
- What, you don't think so?

40
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:42,552
I like comedies.
'Ya wanna see a movie?

41
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:45,237
No, Miss Greenstein, I'm sorry.

42
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:47,788
- Did you get my note?
- I did. - And?

43
00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:50,524
It was very clever of you
to write it in Latin.

44
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:53,344
With the repeated use of the
passive periphrastic?

45
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:56,540
- It was quite propagate.
- And how I was sending up Cicero

46
00:02:56,596 --> 00:03:00,256
with all those alliterative adjectives
thrusting themselves into the verbs?

47
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:02,443
- None of this was lost on me.
- So?

48
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:04,541
Miss Greenstein,

49
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:08,943
you are very, very bright and
very profession in your way,

50
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:13,922
But there are certain rules,
mores (mawr-eyz), if you will,

51
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:16,148
lines that we don't cross.

52
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:18,149
(Laughs) Ah, ha.

53
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:22,814
I'm not joking, actually, and I'm gonna
ask you in the future to refrain...

54
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:24,899
No! No, no, no... No!
Please, don't do that!

55
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,100
I'm gonna ask you to open
that door, Miss Greenstein.

56
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,880
Lingua sed torpet, tenuis sub artus
[But my tongue becomes immobile]

57
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,986
Flamma demanat, sonitu suopte
[A thin flame goes down under my weak limbs]

58
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,853
Catullus 51, the Lesbia
cycle, yes. However,

59
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:40,779
Oh, no, no, no!
Abs... Absolutely not!

60
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:43,058
Miss Greenstein!

61
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:45,658
This is not good for either of us!

62
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:48,384
No, Miss Greenstein! No!
Restrain yourself!

63
00:03:49,058 --> 00:03:51,058
Oh! Oh! Excuse me! Um... I... I... I...

64
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:57,017
Maggie! Mag... Maggie! Please don't go.
Miss Greenstein was just leaving.

65
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:15,735
- Maggie. Absolutely nothing.
- You don't have to say anything.

66
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:18,428
I would never...
She... She... She went and just puh!

67
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:23,928
They're all in love with you.
Just like Harvard.

68
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:25,473
Who told you that?

69
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:29,991
This is the classics department. No one is
more gossipy than you people.

70
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:35,354
Ok, I am going to Cambridge in
the morning. It's just a lunch.

71
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:37,594
I don't wanna know.

72
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:55,251
We don't deal in crystal meth.
We don't deal in cocaine.

73
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:58,012
Not your rock stuff or your powder.

74
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:02,051
We don't do nothing ya gotta cook up
in a spoon and shoot into your arm.

75
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:05,451
Pills? Pharmaceuticals?
Hell, no, by and large.

76
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,070
Maybe, well, maybe the black molly's
gonna pass through these hands

77
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:13,350
on his way to somewheres else, just
on account of the fact I used to like

78
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,650
pop in high school, 'cuz I had
to get my homework done.

79
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:18,728
But that's generally where
we draw the line.

80
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:23,329
No, sir. We deal in 100% pure
Oklahoma grown, exclusive. Why?

81
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:28,213
Because I ain't gonna blow my house up
mixing up antihistamines into dynamite.

82
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,094
And, spiritually, I don't
cotton to somethin'

83
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:31,795
that's gotta pass
through a needle.

84
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:33,941
Chemicals, well, I just don't like 'em.

85
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:36,928
My people was bootleggers
before all this.

86
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:40,967
It was a backyard operation.
They did it natural.

87
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:45,520
Little bit more of a science nowadays.
I will grant ya that.

88
00:05:46,786 --> 00:05:49,386
You say you changed your mind,
getcha up north.

89
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:51,659
- He mentioned Texas.
- Texas ain't gonna happen.

90
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:53,873
Dick, we don't wanna sell in Texas.

91
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:57,166
Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri.

92
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:01,532
I ain't interested.

93
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:03,933
He say you'd better get your
mind around being interested.

94
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,033
Meaning what?

95
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:10,385
Meaning your choice is to expand your
business, or we shut you down entire.

96
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:12,402
Then how you gonna pay your debt?

97
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:15,104
- Well, what happened to Fat Back?
- Arrested last week.

98
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:18,657
- And the Rawls feller up in Liberty Mans?
- Blowed his house up.

99
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:20,983
Oh, see, that's.. that
what I'm talkin' about.

100
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:22,084
Well, it's tough times.

101
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:23,284
Well, ain't it the truth.

102
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:25,690
Used to be, you could get a couple
of trip wires, a couple of booby traps,

103
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:27,636
a good set of dogs,
you pay off your local constable,

104
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,822
and you just live out on the property.

105
00:06:29,902 --> 00:06:34,035
Feed her a little 13-13-13 fertilizer,
like growing summer beans.

106
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:36,736
Even the war on drugs passed us by.

107
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:38,708
Course, now they come up
with the war on terror.

108
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:42,209
Not that I ain't interested in the travails
of a small-time drug dealer,

109
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,548
- Oh, you calling me small-time?
- We gotta make it to Tulsa.

110
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:47,561
Do you know that I was the first grower
in the State that ever employed hydroponics?

111
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,720
What's hydroponics?

112
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:51,121
Germinating the seed in water,
you shit-for-brains.

113
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,333
Do you know how many
generations of hybridization

114
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:55,134
I've had to do to get my
top three varietals?

115
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,198
There is a goddamn reason
I grow the best!

116
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,113
- Enough, Brady. What's it gonna be?
- Pug wants his money!

117
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,013
Well, If I'd a known about a timetable,
we'd have been doing that.

118
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,819
Shut your face about a timetable.
He's offering you a way out.

119
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,159
You sure as shit better take it,

120
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,360
or he's gonna bust up in your
glory hole, like nobody's business.

121
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:43,268
We should turn it loose.

122
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:15,212
I ain't gonna manufacture or purvey

123
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:18,158
anything that I won't ingest into my
own sweet self. Lookit here.

124
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,964
How you gonna call that
a controlled substance?

125
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:27,130
- Well, the government do.
- Look at the bud structure on it.

126
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:31,571
The crystal density, the smell of them
terpenes. You can't synthesize that.

127
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,543
That is nature's delivery
system for goodness,

128
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,710
distilled into a pure form.

129
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:42,329
It glides down into your belly,
and blooms into a feeling of peace,

130
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:44,835
in this world beset by evil.

131
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:48,529
That world is gonna be there, no matter
how much grass you smoke.

132
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:53,495
Now, look here. You wanted to build
the fucking Taj Mahal to hydroponics.

133
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,848
- Well?
- And you done it.

134
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:58,628
But you know what you
was gettin' into with him,

135
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:01,929
and he sure as shit
ain't goin' away.

136
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:04,547
Brady!

137
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:10,786
My mind's workin' on it.

138
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:20,387
<i>Well, I sat down in the
closet, with all my overalls</i>

139
00:09:20,788 --> 00:09:25,688
<i>Tryin' to get away from
all the ears inside my walls</i>

140
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:31,189
<i>Dreamed the police heard
everything I thought... what then?</i>

141
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,390
<i>Well, I went to court and the
judge's name was Hoffman</i>

142
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:38,863
- Howdy, Sharon. Where's she at?
- Oh, she's in her usual spot.

143
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,916
- Hi, Joe!
- Brady.

144
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:43,617
<i>...to escape reality</i>

145
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:49,418
<i>And you may see me
tonight, with an illegal smile</i>

146
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,919
<i>It don't cost very much...</i>

147
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:55,535
- Hey, mama.
- Oh, hey. Whatcha got there?

148
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:59,935
Oh... It's a new article on Billy,
and a theory he wrote hisself.

149
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,387
Thank you.

150
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:05,588
- Ya know, I've been thinkin'.
- Hmm?

151
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,481
Maybe, maybe your daddy
wanted to get killed.

152
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,467
Somehow, I got this picture of him,
runnin' toward a machine gun,

153
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:16,258
because he'd rather die that way,

154
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,593
than come back to Little Dixie, and
grow old, stare through a window.

155
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:24,919
Well, seeing how he was on about
every drug imaginable,

156
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:26,892
I... I wouldn't spend my time
trying to figure out

157
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,093
what was in his head
over 30 years ago.

158
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:31,218
Do you remember him at all?

159
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:35,492
I remember smelling weed the
first time... on him.

160
00:10:35,777 --> 00:10:37,706
Well, that certainly had its impact.

161
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:40,004
Daisy, why... why don't you
come home with us

162
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,805
and live with me and
Colleen for awhile?

163
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:44,251
- Colleen and me.
- Colleen and me.

164
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:46,703
What's your version
of proper grammar?

165
00:10:47,736 --> 00:10:50,737
Rhythm, maybe.
Dumb Dutch question.

166
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,270
You're 12 years younger than
anyone in here. This is ridiculous!

167
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,869
I like it here. I can do what I want,

168
00:10:57,255 --> 00:11:01,389
and I'm not eager to get stranded when you
get yourself killed or taken back to prison.

169
00:11:02,415 --> 00:11:05,181
Mama, Colleen is pregnant.

170
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:08,213
You don't say?

171
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:10,214
I've been dying to tell 'ya!

172
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:12,434
Ahhh, well, I'm happy for you.

173
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:14,568
Well, how 'bout you?
You're gonna be a grandma.

174
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:17,969
Are you gonna be a husband?

175
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:20,212
I ain't dead.

176
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,814
Your father was a freaked-out
genius who wasted his life.

177
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:26,131
He could have done anything.

178
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:29,966
Got a higher IQ than your brother,
and he just passed you by.

179
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:32,999
I... I... I ain't tryin'
to keep up with Billy.

180
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,852
I ain't him, and he ain't me.

181
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:40,378
Mama, I like who I am just fine.

182
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:44,651
You think I'll see him again before I die?

183
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,317
I think it's gonna take one of us dying
to get him to come back down here.

184
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:04,736
Well, nice sittin' with ya.

185
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:57,856
Gorgeous.

186
00:12:58,484 --> 00:13:02,991
This is wonderful. I... I... I almost
never eat out in Providence.

187
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:06,630
Ya know, now and then on Federal Hill,
but not nearly enough.

188
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:10,893
I hear your book on Marcus Aurelius
has the whole community astir.

189
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:14,435
- Oh, thanks.
- Which press was that again? -Oxford.

190
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,990
But they did your translation
of the Menaechmi last year.

191
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:20,491
They did. They've been terrific.

192
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:23,621
Plautus. How do you find the time?

193
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,527
Well, I don't have a life.

194
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,334
I read some biographical material
on you last week, Bill.

195
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:35,735
You, ah, you come from
humble beginnings.

196
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,839
I do, yea.

197
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,145
- Where was it? Omaha?
- Oklahoma.

198
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,700
Oh, why don't you, ah,
why don't you have an accent?

199
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,601
With some considerable
effort, I lost it.

200
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:50,545
- Your father was a bootlegger.
- It was my grandfather, actually.

201
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,699
- Fantastic.
- Why fantastic?

202
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:56,352
I don't know. So many of us were
trained for this life.

203
00:13:56,997 --> 00:13:59,294
Fancy private schools,
parents in academia.

204
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:01,818
I'm always astounded by those
who made their own way.

205
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:07,976
Oh, thank you. I, ah, my
family is a bit eccentric.

206
00:14:08,316 --> 00:14:09,835
I found discipline in books.

207
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:13,272
Well, you're probably wondering
why Dean Sorenson is here.

208
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:18,650
Bill, we'd like to offer you
a position in the Law School.

209
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:22,235
You can't be serious?

210
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,996
We've been wanting to incorporate
more philosophy into the curriculum,

211
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:30,975
and when we got wind of your hesitancy
in transferring up from Brown in Classics,

212
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:33,168
we came up with the idea
of letting you create

213
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:36,369
your own institute
for our law students.

214
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:47,134
I, ah, don't even know how to begin to
respond. That is such a precipitous offer.

215
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,913
Savor it. Digest it.

216
00:14:50,192 --> 00:14:53,426
Moments like this come
too seldom in life.

217
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:56,232
I, ah, I'll say.

218
00:14:56,272 --> 00:15:00,639
We all want you here, Bill.
You've crafted your career diligently.

219
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:03,952
It makes absolute sense
as your next step.

220
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:07,505
You've a dollop of japeno.

221
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,223
Mmm, honey, that's better,
you're the best.

222
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:16,124
Thank you, Brady.

223
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:19,450
- Look how sexy you look.
- I do not. - You do.

224
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:22,800
How long the doctor give me till I
got to throw up that old detour sign?

225
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:24,347
Well, just wait till I'm
done with these dishes.

226
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:29,349
Oh, well, push that... Gonna put
you right on the burner. Bring it, electric!

227
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:33,382
Comin' at ya. Dug in
and comin' at ya.

228
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:36,388
Hello?

229
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:39,501
Well, can I ask who's calling?

230
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:43,354
Can I ask what this is about?

231
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:47,368
Because I'm the girlfriend
he's fixin' to marry, is why.

232
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,626
- Who is it? Who is it?
- Some fellow named Pug.

233
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:53,554
- I'll take it in the back there.
- It better not be...

234
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:55,355
It ain't, it ain't.
It's a man about a truck.

235
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:57,306
Hey, Brady!

236
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:02,952
- Hey, Pug. How are y...
- [indistinct] down there, Brady?

237
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:05,966
- Ooh, oh, ah, yes we did.
- They told you I needed an answer?

238
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:08,039
Yes, sir, they made that pretty
clear. I was just hopin'...

239
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,340
I want to see you tomorrow evening.

240
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:15,931
- Well, tomorrow night's gonna be...
- You heard me, Brady!

241
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:37,809
- Yea? - Bolger! - Hey, buddy.
- Pug just called me.

242
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:38,910
Pug called you hisself?

243
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:41,117
Yea, he want us up there.

244
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:44,018
- What does he want?
- No, he want to see us.

245
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:46,755
- You gonna change...?
- No, I ain't changin' my mind one bit.

246
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:49,488
- I don't like this at all, Brady.
- Well, we just gonna have to

247
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:51,089
be ready to deal then
and come what may.

248
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,407
You know me, I'm gonna
be up there with ya.

249
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:56,308
I'll see ya.

250
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,659
Hello?

251
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:08,699
Lola who?

252
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:11,172
Ah, ah, ah, hang on, hang on.

253
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:19,457
How did you get this number?

254
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:27,931
Hi, did that man get a hold of you?

255
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:30,015
He did, yea.

256
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,216
He said it was an emergency, so I...

257
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:35,644
You did the right thing, thanks.

258
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:46,174
Was there something else?

259
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:48,175
Is everything all right?

260
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:50,662
Well, my brother's been murdered.

261
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:52,934
Bill, that's awful!

262
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:55,315
I didn't even know
you had a brother!

263
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:57,654
How?

264
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:00,600
He got shot with a crossbow.

265
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,532
I beg your pardon?

266
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:05,900
They're inexplicably popular
where I come from.

267
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:08,960
Was it an accident?

268
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:13,973
No, because then it
wouldn't be a murder.

269
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:18,985
Ah, oh, I don't know even know what...
When was the last time you saw him?

270
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:22,011
Um, it had been a long time.

271
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:24,532
What will you do?

272
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,951
Well, ah, I suppose I
have to go home.

273
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:37,644
What brings you to Tulsa?

274
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,523
Pardon? Oh, ah, family matter.

275
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:44,243
I was gonna say, because
nobody visits Oklahoma, ya know,

276
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:48,416
and it's one of those states where you
live there, maybe you got business there,

277
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:51,569
but you don't see people
coming for the attractions.

278
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:54,695
- Right.
- What do ya do?

279
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:59,415
I, ah, I write and teach.
I'm a professor.

280
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:03,368
- Of?
- Classical Philosophy.

281
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:07,840
There's not too much
use for that these days.

282
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:11,954
Humanity hasn't changed
that much, actually.

283
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:14,325
Do you have family in Tulsa?

284
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:16,626
No, no. Idabel.

285
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:19,612
Little Dixie?

286
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:24,173
I hope it's not tragedy
that brings you back.

287
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:29,892
- It is for someone.
- I'm sorry. - Thanks

288
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:38,011
I'm an orthodontist.

289
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,044
Was, I mean. Will be again.

290
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:45,317
Have you had work done?

291
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:50,303
- No, no, actually, I haven't.
- Yea, I can.. I can tell.

292
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,321
You got a nice face, though.

293
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:56,322
Thanks.

294
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,296
- Ken Feinman
- Bill Kincaid

295
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:03,402
- You have kids, Bill?
- No

296
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:06,815
I'm starting out
all over. Yea.

297
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:11,075
People don't realize it, but it's...
it's tough to break in, and you get

298
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,304
most of your business, ya know,
through your kids' school, in your church,

299
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,799
synagogue, in my case, ya know,

300
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,967
but it's tough, I mean the costs
of a practice these days

301
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:23,440
is just, ah, it's
downright humiliating.

302
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,733
Honestly, it's
downright humiliating.

303
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:30,606
- Hmm, yea, I believe you.
- We were living in Manhattan,

304
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:34,985
but, ah, I grew up in Tulsa, so,
ya know, we just moved back.

305
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:37,658
Are there a lot
of Jews in Tulsa?

306
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:39,459
That's.. that's what..
that's what everyone asks,

307
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,501
but.. but there are. No, it's...

308
00:20:41,502 --> 00:20:44,902
it's a small community,
but very cohesive,

309
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:47,824
and, ya know, the pull
was unimaginable.

310
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,831
Kenny, do you see
the man is reading?

311
00:20:51,257 --> 00:20:53,457
I don't think he wants
to sit and listen to you

312
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,558
chronicle the evolution
of Tulsa Jewry.

313
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:59,216
I'll let you get back
to your reading.

314
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:01,876
Thanks.

315
00:21:11,314 --> 00:21:13,214
It's a little embarrassing.
I don't.. don't mean to be..

316
00:21:13,215 --> 00:21:15,215
It's just, ah, if you've got
family down there.

317
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,915
- Ya know, nieces and nephews...
- I don't.

318
00:21:18,114 --> 00:21:20,781
I mean, if you did or,
you know...

319
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:24,334
It's, ah, it's.. it's not too far away,

320
00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:28,554
- and, ah, you know, I do great work.
- I.. I know you do.

321
00:21:30,712 --> 00:21:33,079
I never take accidental
encounters for granted.

322
00:21:33,112 --> 00:21:36,753
- Kenny! Kenny!
- So... I'm gonna run.

323
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,109
- Rick Bolger
- Hey, Rick.

324
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,377
-Folks call me Bolger.
- Nice to meet ya.

325
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:07,536
Man! You sure do
look like him.

326
00:22:07,537 --> 00:22:10,137
I think that's what they
mean by identical.

327
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:12,502
Your brother was
a great friend to me.

328
00:22:12,688 --> 00:22:15,855
I... I hadn't seen him
in awhile, but.. thanks.

329
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:18,689
- You ain't got no bags?
- No, that's it.

330
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:22,941
Nice to meet you.

331
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:30,542
<i>My wildest dreams grow
wilder every day</i>

332
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:34,343
<i>There's nothing I can
think or do or say</i>

333
00:22:34,907 --> 00:22:38,974
I ain't been up here in awhile.
I was gonna stay in a hotel.

334
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:40,333
Where'd ya go?

335
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:45,134
Found me a dead-end in a
construction site near the airport.

336
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:49,923
Laid out, counting stars. Crazy how
much building they got goin' on up there.

337
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:52,925
Folks just don't take to the
country no more, I guess.

338
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:55,544
You figure?

339
00:22:57,984 --> 00:22:59,984
Mystery...

340
00:22:59,985 --> 00:23:01,585
<i>I swear I'll get it right</i>

341
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:07,486
<i>My wildest dreams grow
wilder every day</i>

342
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:12,787
<i>I'm wonderin' just how far
my mind can stray</i>

343
00:23:15,088 --> 00:23:18,788
<i>Just how wild is too
high a price to pay</i>

344
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,541
You need a drink or anything?

345
00:23:21,622 --> 00:23:24,622
Comin' up on Broken Bow.
Can stop off at the Me Tote Em.

346
00:23:25,381 --> 00:23:27,381
Sure.

347
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:32,468
Me Tote?

348
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:52,546
Oh! I almost forgot.
This here is your brother's.

349
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,019
I don't know if you want it.

350
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:41,814
You're shittin' me.

351
00:24:45,593 --> 00:24:47,593
Buddy!

352
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:53,287
You clean up nice.

353
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:55,609
How's that?

354
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:57,646
Where's the tux from?

355
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,466
Oh, God, no, no, wait a second,
wait a second. You, you...

356
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:06,731
- Where's Bolger at? - He's around back,
but I'm... I'm not who you think I am.

357
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:09,525
- Oh, you're not?
- No, you don't know me.

358
00:25:09,526 --> 00:25:11,926
Oh, well, what I wanna know is what
you're doin' up here in Broken Bow,

359
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:16,227
when we don't want
you in Broken Bow?

360
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,337
Um, it's my mistake.
I'm... I'm just gonna leave.

361
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:22,238
Yea, well, not till Buddy
gets here, you won't.

362
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,649
Buddy?

363
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,750
Calm down! Calm down!

364
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:31,083
- Keep it up, Brady.
- I'm his brother! I'm not... Ohhhh! Ohhhh!

365
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:37,555
You don't wanna be comin' up north,
where you ain't got no tripwires,

366
00:25:37,556 --> 00:25:40,656
or booby traps, and hos you done bribed.

367
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:44,821
Maybe even sell your souped-up turbo
grass to whoever you... [Gunshot]

368
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,259
- I wondered where you was at.
- Don't seem like too fair a fight.

369
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:52,347
Well, nobody asked you two
to come up north, neither.

370
00:25:52,448 --> 00:25:54,848
Well, we had some business
to take care of up in Tulsa.

371
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:57,160
- I heard somethin' about that.
- What you heard?

372
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,126
Heard that Brady here
owes Pug a lot of money.

373
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:01,327
Will you explain this, please.

374
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:04,646
The less you say to these two
fuckin' inbreds, the better.

375
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:07,613
Heard he thinks you're gonna expand
business down to our Little Dixie.

376
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:11,758
- The young pussy already said.
- How 'bout I say THIS!

377
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,883
How ya feelin'?

378
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:31,633
- Brady?
- Hey, buddy.

379
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:34,163
What the hell is goin' on?

380
00:26:34,783 --> 00:26:37,750
Well, I think Sally got razor happy.

381
00:26:38,622 --> 00:26:41,409
- What? Are you out of your mind?
- Okay, easy now.

382
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,010
Hold on to him, now. Hold on.

383
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:46,585
- No, let go of me! Let me go!
- Not until you calm down, he won't!

384
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:50,275
You had him tell me you were dead?
With a fucking crossbow?

385
00:26:50,282 --> 00:26:52,319
Well, all right,
I'm sorry 'bout that,

386
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,420
but there were no other way for me
to get you to come down here.

387
00:26:54,461 --> 00:26:58,419
Ow! Ow! Ahhh...
Down here for what?

388
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,654
- I'm gettin' married.
- As if I care. What kind of excuse is that?

389
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,500
And I'm having a baby.
You're gonna be an uncle.

390
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,486
Who... Who would be dumb enough
to have a child with you?

391
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:11,719
I would.

392
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,679
You remember the Dentons?
On Luminus back home?

393
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:18,559
- Colleen Denton?
- You remember.

394
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,512
I babysat you when
we were in high school.

395
00:27:24,318 --> 00:27:28,958
You was my favorite. You used
to sit in the kitchen reading books.

396
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:32,531
I got to watch all the TV I wanted,
as long as I kept the door shut.

397
00:27:32,797 --> 00:27:35,964
You were reading Shakespeare sonnets
when I was going to sleep.

398
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:38,563
And now you're gonna
marry this pothead?

399
00:27:38,677 --> 00:27:41,244
- No, he's not no more.
- Ah, leaving all that behind.

400
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:44,183
Oh, oh, yea, I can see the
evidence for that everywhere.

401
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:47,715
I get to keep on smokin' till my baby comes,
and then it's cold turkey on that, too.

402
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:51,256
But me and Bolger's gonna smoke
till the bottom drops out, ain't we?

403
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:54,834
Oh, what a... what a great time.

404
00:27:54,835 --> 00:27:58,735
Anyway, you know what? I wanna leave
as quickly and painlessly as possible.

405
00:27:58,995 --> 00:28:02,307
- Hang on. Just stay through the weekend.
- No. - You could go see mom.

406
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:06,935
Look, Brady, I am leaving. What... What you
did here is cruel and irresponsible

407
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:08,673
and exactly why I stay away.

408
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,153
No. You... You know I read every
goddamn article you write.

409
00:28:11,353 --> 00:28:14,986
I read 50 pages on the interpretation
of one word in Aristol.

410
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,871
Sat there the whole fucking
day with a dictionary,

411
00:28:16,872 --> 00:28:19,672
and not the Merriam Webster,
either, the motherfucking OED.

412
00:28:19,793 --> 00:28:22,112
Ain't 20 people in the world
read that whole piece, I'll bet,

413
00:28:22,113 --> 00:28:23,213
and you're lookin' at one of 'em.

414
00:28:23,272 --> 00:28:25,996
What do you... What do you want, Brady?
I mean, what do you fuckin' want?

415
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:28,809
I just want to see my brother,
who I love. What's the crime?

416
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:32,649
Why couldn't you pick up the phone, and
call me, and just ask me to come down,

417
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:35,731
- like anyone normal person?
- Because when I do, you never call me back.

418
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,704
And, if you did, you'd just
say no. Am I lying?

419
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,584
- Well, am I lying?
- No. No, you're not.

420
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:50,729
- Wow... We ain't bad people, Billy.
- I know you're not.

421
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,910
You know mom put
herself in a home?

422
00:28:52,989 --> 00:28:55,629
- A rest home?
- She did. - Jesus.

423
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:58,949
You want her to die down here, and
you don't even come to say goodbye.

424
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:02,935
- Is she still using drugs?
- Just go see her and find out for yourself.

425
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:06,842
I can't. I c.. I.. I.. I just
can't. I can't go and...

426
00:29:06,948 --> 00:29:10,451
What the hell did any of us ever
do that made you hate us this way?

427
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:14,133
I don't hate you.
I really don't. I just...

428
00:29:14,326 --> 00:29:16,093
And.. And where you're from don't
matter to ya? Your family?

429
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:17,294
Your own fuckin' brother?

430
00:29:17,307 --> 00:29:20,807
Look, I try to live my life with a
purposeful measure of control.

431
00:29:20,946 --> 00:29:25,213
I adhere to certain philosophic tenets
that were laid down centuries ago

432
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,946
by some very
introspective thinkers.

433
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:30,886
I'm talking about three
fucking days in Idabel.

434
00:29:33,424 --> 00:29:35,458
Son of a bitch.

435
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:40,745
Ok, look, I will stay through the
weekend. But then I'm out of here.

436
00:29:41,224 --> 00:29:43,224
Do you understand?

437
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:48,297
Hey! Hey, don't you
fuck around. Stop! Jesus!

438
00:29:55,183 --> 00:29:58,050
God! I think he thought
we were selling dime bags.

439
00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:00,016
What is all this?

440
00:30:00,017 --> 00:30:02,417
Well, let me enlighten
you on a point or two.

441
00:30:02,662 --> 00:30:05,595
It all starts in the mama room.
Ya got your young'uns over here,

442
00:30:06,342 --> 00:30:08,508
your juvies, and your
adults in the back.

443
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:10,820
All these lights are sodium-vapor.

444
00:30:10,821 --> 00:30:12,821
Portalux HP 1000 watts

445
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,961
Incandescent's got too much
far red in the spectrum.

446
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,520
Makes the plant grow
too tall on the stem,

447
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:21,121
and the leaves get all nine,
and the whole thing just keels over.

448
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,920
Plus, it reduces the potency,
which is definitely not what we want.

449
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:26,459
Now, LED's gettin'
to be all the rage

450
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,760
'cause it's cooler and
saves ya on power costs, but...

451
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,858
I'm a sodium-vapor man!

452
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:34,226
Ya know, we got your
electronic digital balance

453
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:37,526
Hey, raise 'er up, Bolger!

454
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:42,242
- Who built all this?
- Me and Bolger.

455
00:30:42,295 --> 00:30:44,257
Had a few buddies help
us with the heavy liftin'.

456
00:30:44,258 --> 00:30:46,158
Your brother designed
every bit of it.

457
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:47,697
The horticultural part.

458
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:51,131
Quonset, ah, comes in a fuckin' catalog kit.
Grade-schoolers could've assembled it.

459
00:30:51,138 --> 00:30:52,691
We should've got a contractor
to pour the pad,

460
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:55,592
but we couldn't likely hire
one of those, could we?

461
00:30:55,676 --> 00:31:00,370
- And, and, what... what are all these?
- Oh, NFT Spiral System. - NFT?

462
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:02,736
Yea, nutrient film technique.

463
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:05,279
No soil in there. These pipes
are filled with hydroclay.

464
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:08,962
It's like an expanded clay aggregate,
supports the active capillaries.

465
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:11,596
It's just that and coconut husks,
if you can believe that shit.

466
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:16,072
No acid, no alkaline in the base,
totally sterile medium.

467
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:19,981
You're lookin' at cell generation
of hybridization cloning,

468
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:22,248
through all my special
little children.

469
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,475
And we feed ya good,
too, don't we?

470
00:31:24,694 --> 00:31:27,428
Pump the nutrients, see, up into the
medium from underneath.

471
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:32,321
Big Bud, Connoisseur, Nirvana, Jungle
Juice, Tarantula, the whole shitteroo.

472
00:31:34,013 --> 00:31:37,146
You're looking at the
motherfuckin' state of the art.

473
00:31:38,972 --> 00:31:39,900
I don't know what to say.

474
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:43,901
You hear that, Bolger, we
rendered him speechless! Huh!

475
00:31:44,172 --> 00:31:46,355
- You wanna try some?
- No

476
00:31:46,452 --> 00:31:49,986
I make my living with my mind,
and, so, I like to keep it clear.

477
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,625
I forgot who I was talking to.

478
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,391
Traveling through his
optic space-time. Shit.

479
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:56,691
Let's go sit on the back porch.
I've got a new varietal.

480
00:31:56,692 --> 00:31:59,192
I really gotta give her a test drive.

481
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,904
Now, I read an article you wrote in
the New York Review of Books,

482
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,637
- 'bout a fellow called Heidegigger.
- Heidegger?

483
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,057
That's the one.
What kind of name is that?

484
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:15,263
Oh, it was a review of a book exploring
Jacques Lacan's take on Heidegger.

485
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:18,256
Exactly! That right there is what I
don't understand about y'all! I mean...

486
00:32:18,448 --> 00:32:20,702
Y'all ever... hardly ever
write about a topic!

487
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:24,342
I mean, you write about what some
other fellow wrote about the topic.

488
00:32:24,448 --> 00:32:28,302
So, so Heidegger's got some idea, and then
some, some French guy's got a take on that,

489
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:29,624
then you write a review of that,

490
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:32,425
and some other fellow's gonna come
along and on and on and on and on.

491
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:34,891
You very neatly explained
academia, Brady.

492
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,320
So, I'll write and say for all y'all.

493
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,421
It's just called,
"What the Fuck's the Point"?

494
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:40,547
Ya know what? I think this is
right about where I leave.

495
00:32:40,646 --> 00:32:42,913
Come on, come on.

496
00:32:43,014 --> 00:32:45,514
- Give you a tug on that.
- I said no.

497
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:48,232
You used to do this more'n I did.
You couldn't get enough of it.

498
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:51,052
Well, I just don't do it anymore.

499
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:55,053
Oh, I know you want some.
It's written all over your face.

500
00:32:55,164 --> 00:32:58,698
Look, the shit I grow is better than
anything you're gonna taste anywhere.

501
00:32:58,804 --> 00:33:01,305
Makes that Jamaica shit we
used to buy taste like tobacco.

502
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:03,111
Oh, I'll bet it does.

503
00:33:03,184 --> 00:33:08,517
A tiny taste. A little, little,
bitty, ole taste. Just.. Taste!

504
00:33:09,023 --> 00:33:14,373
Fine, fine. Fuck, I don't believe I'm
doing this. This is so fucking stupid!

505
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:16,923
When was the last time you did it?

506
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:21,070
- Graduate school.
- I'll bet this is gonna lay you out.

507
00:33:22,243 --> 00:33:26,343
- You remember the first time? With ma?
- I remember.

508
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:28,929
[Both] Fucking ridiculous.

509
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,398
I guess she just figured we were
gonna find out on our own, anyway.

510
00:33:31,522 --> 00:33:33,889
I... I don't wanna know
what she was thinking about.

511
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:44,621
Oh, come on, give it a real pull there.

512
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,020
Now, how many buds are you
gonna smoke that's that

513
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:55,421
smooth after you ain't done
it in a number of years?

514
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,836
I've been lengthening the maturing
process more in the Dutch tradition,

515
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:01,746
- and I got just the right amount of resin.
- Wow!

516
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:23,317
Ooohhh! Now we're cookin'.

517
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:25,877
So, anyways, I seem
to recall you didn't..

518
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:28,378
you didn't think too much
of this fellow, Heidegigger.

519
00:34:28,476 --> 00:34:33,809
What? No, he was a fucking fascist.
He... He held down the National Socialists.

520
00:34:34,356 --> 00:34:38,856
All right, but this article was about
logic and... and truth, and

521
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:42,994
about him and some other fellow
related to, uh...

522
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:46,507
- Analytic philosophy.
- What was it? - Analytic philosophy.

523
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:50,053
Analytic philosophy.
Analytic philosophy.

524
00:34:50,473 --> 00:34:53,153
There was one word I didn't know.
I had to look it up. Epista...

525
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:55,927
- Epistemology.
- Epista what? - Epistemology.

526
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:58,012
Epistemology, bingo, bingo.

527
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,333
Why are we talking about this?

528
00:35:01,713 --> 00:35:03,996
Just solving problems.

529
00:35:04,432 --> 00:35:06,071
Just solving problems.

530
00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:09,472
Like... Like, when all of a sudden,
you get hit with a answer,

531
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:12,110
to a mess you've been in,

532
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:15,295
and as soon as it hit ya, ya can't hardly
believe ya didn't think of it before.

533
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:18,311
What is it you want, Brady?

534
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:21,698
- Here, git ya another pull on that.
- No, I'm fucking euthanized.

535
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,357
Go on, now.
Go on!

536
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,357
All right, now, here's the thing.

537
00:35:30,749 --> 00:35:33,916
All that equipment you see
out yonder. It was expensive.

538
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,630
So I had to go see this Jew up in
Tulsa, who's kinda in the business.

539
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:40,995
- What do ya mean, he's in the business?
- Well, the dope dealing business.

540
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:43,936
A Jew in the business?
How do ya know he's a Jew?

541
00:35:43,937 --> 00:35:46,237
Well, he... Trust me, he's a Jew.

542
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:48,121
Well, what does that mean?
He has a Jewish last name?

543
00:35:48,122 --> 00:35:49,322
He's a goddamn Jew!

544
00:35:49,368 --> 00:35:52,208
- Don't be anti-Semitic.
- Anti what? - Anti-Jew.

545
00:35:52,347 --> 00:35:54,994
I ain't anti-Jew!
I loves everybody!

546
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,998
Oh, Jesus! So, okay, he's a
dope dealer. So what...

547
00:35:58,267 --> 00:36:00,534
Well, he's not really a dealer. He's...
He's a little more upstream than that,

548
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:02,535
but I've been his main supplier of grass.

549
00:36:02,586 --> 00:36:04,756
- I still don't see...
- Will ya listen? Ya just..

550
00:36:04,757 --> 00:36:05,957
Ya know, ya never listen!

551
00:36:06,026 --> 00:36:08,860
Okay, okay, fine, I'm listening.

552
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,165
I need you to be me.

553
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,166
What?

554
00:36:13,206 --> 00:36:16,039
Down here, just like we
used to back at home,

555
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,440
while I go up there and
figure out this whole situation.

556
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:20,995
No fucking chance, Brady.

557
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:23,518
Well, look, I've got this one
figured. It's so simple.

558
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,419
All you gotta do is go and visit mom.

559
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:27,991
You don't think mom is gonna know
the difference between you and me?

560
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:31,311
It ain't about mom, goddamn it.
It's the sheriff. It's he we're gonna fool.

561
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:34,157
We don't even look alike, anymore.
Has that occurred to you?

562
00:36:34,383 --> 00:36:36,317
Bolger said when you walked into
that Me Tote Em, it took all of

563
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:39,518
five seconds for them boys to figure
out it was me with a shave and haircut.

564
00:36:39,603 --> 00:36:43,493
- Which is why he took me to Broken Bow.
- He said you wanted to go.

565
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:49,383
Brady, Brady, I swear
to God, even for you...

566
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,141
Well, that might have
been Bolger's idea,

567
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,842
but I didn't know nothing about
it till you all showed up here.

568
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:55,035
And let me tell you something else.
We're going back up to Broken Bow,

569
00:36:55,036 --> 00:36:56,736
and we're gonna whip some country ass.

570
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,314
No, no, you're not.

571
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:01,661
Started without us?

572
00:37:02,062 --> 00:37:03,862
Well, you know you can't have
none of this good stuff.

573
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,991
I know, but I'm being polite.
The rest of 'em came.

574
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,754
That is so weird.

575
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:13,686
Oh, Janet, this is my dear brother, Bill.
Bill, this is our good friend, Janet.

576
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,739
- Hi, I'm Bill. - You havin' a smoke?
- Oh, I wa... I was, yea.

577
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:22,299
- Oh, uh, do you want some?
- Oh, I'm gonna get a beer, thanks.

578
00:37:22,398 --> 00:37:25,872
Yea, I... I... I usually
don't, either. I... I...

579
00:37:25,873 --> 00:37:27,973
Actually, actually,
I never do. I... I'm...

580
00:37:28,017 --> 00:37:30,674
It's all right. Nobody
can say no to Brady.

581
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:32,575
Mojo, I got the mojo.

582
00:37:32,657 --> 00:37:33,994
I kinda forgot.

583
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:36,195
So, Bolger says you're a famous,
what was it you said, Bolger?

584
00:37:36,257 --> 00:37:38,597
- A famous thinker.
- A famous thinker.

585
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:42,243
- He's real famous.
- In certain esoteric circles, aught maybe.

586
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:44,860
And they pay you for that?

587
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:48,661
Well, I... I... I lecture,
and I... I teach. I am a professor.

588
00:37:48,695 --> 00:37:52,529
- I was just fuckin' with you.
- Ah, you're... Yea... - Nice to meet you.

589
00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:55,915
Go ahead, get in the coda.

590
00:37:58,516 --> 00:38:02,916
- She's a poet. - What?
- Seriously, she writes fuckin' poetry.

591
00:38:03,095 --> 00:38:05,992
And she's the ladies
noodling champion of '05.

592
00:38:06,254 --> 00:38:11,158
125 pounds of catfish, in under 10 hours,
with nothing but her bare hands.

593
00:38:13,173 --> 00:38:15,441
I tried to get her and Colleen
in a three-way once,

594
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:19,642
but wouldn't neither of 'em go for it.

595
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:22,807
- I'm... I'm leaving on Sunday, you do
understand that, right? - I understand that.

596
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:25,735
- I am not gonna participate...
- No, no, we'll talk about that later.

597
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:28,779
Hey, Bolger, crank her up, man!

598
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:34,712
All this happened in one day.

599
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:38,913
Almost everything that has happened here
has only served to vindicate why I stay away.

600
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:42,911
Oh, come on. Don't tell me that goblet of
goodness in your hand hadn't made ya happy.

601
00:38:43,611 --> 00:38:45,944
No, even that, whatever it actually is.

602
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:49,924
That's Ambrosia, Billy.
That's pure Ambrosia.

603
00:38:55,525 --> 00:39:01,225
<i>Oh, ride the blue wind high and free,
she'll lead you down through misery,</i>

604
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:07,979
<i>Leave you low, come time to go,
alone and low as low can be.</i>

605
00:39:12,993 --> 00:39:19,705
<i>Well, if I had a nickel, I'd find a game.
If I won a dollar, I'd make it rain.</i>

606
00:39:19,706 --> 00:39:26,390
<i>If it rained an ocean, I'd drink it dry,
lay me down dissatisfied.</i>

607
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:35,560
<i>Oh, legs to walk and thoughts to fly,
eyes to laugh...</i>

608
00:39:35,595 --> 00:39:39,972
- So, where do you live now?
- Mmm, Providence, Rhode Island.

609
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:45,211
- Why, why would you come back here?
- It's where I wanna write.

610
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:51,204
- I teach for money. - Is it a college?
- High school, here in town.

611
00:39:51,604 --> 00:39:53,604
High school?

612
00:39:54,123 --> 00:39:57,500
I tried the tenure track,
but college students are already

613
00:39:57,555 --> 00:40:01,207
too culturally informed.
Closes their minds.

614
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:03,743
How come there aren't more
girls, like you, writing Hugo?

615
00:40:03,762 --> 00:40:06,829
Maybe they don't know
how to look.

616
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:13,876
Well, you... you teach... English?

617
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:17,095
- I do.
- Hmm...

618
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:23,121
- My mother used to do that for awhile.
- She must be very proud of you.

619
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,387
- I haven't talked to her in quite awhile.
- Why not?

620
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,973
That is a very complicated subject.

621
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:36,246
- You're some world-famous thinker?
- Har... Hardly

622
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:39,433
Some minorly famous thinker?

623
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:43,992
- And you don't let your mother enjoy that?
- That's correct.

624
00:40:44,238 --> 00:40:48,005
It's not good to have unresolved
problems with your mother.

625
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:56,328
- Why? - Because some day, she'll
be gone. Then where will you be?

626
00:40:56,757 --> 00:41:01,824
- Probably the same place I am right now.
- Exactly.

627
00:41:03,756 --> 00:41:07,957
- You're smart.
- You aren't as smart as you think you are.

628
00:41:08,236 --> 00:41:11,970
Well, hey, I just got tricked by
my dope-dealing brother.

629
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:15,522
We all get tricked some time or other.

630
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:27,195
- Mmm, I don't think so. - No?
- No - Why?

631
00:41:29,234 --> 00:41:32,991
A combination of what you've been
smoking and what I'd do with you.

632
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,200
You'd never recover.

633
00:41:36,793 --> 00:41:39,127
I'll do my best.

634
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:43,673
I'm goin' home.

635
00:41:44,232 --> 00:41:48,686
Well, can't light a cake.
Can... could we just like, um...

636
00:41:50,392 --> 00:41:53,459
I mean, we were, we were
kind of lost... having a hug.

637
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:05,205
I'm going noodling tomorrow,
if you want to tag along.

638
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,037
My brother said that
you did that.

639
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,137
Sweet dreams.

640
00:42:20,709 --> 00:42:23,076
Here you go.

641
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:27,675
Check out the best part.

642
00:42:28,348 --> 00:42:31,989
- Holy shit!
- This here's why I keep it alive.

643
00:42:33,227 --> 00:42:36,361
- Wait a minute. Some of these
are from our room. - Oh, yea.

644
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:43,367
Yup, a few more I picked up along the
road, but all originals. Ain't no knockoffs.

645
00:42:43,387 --> 00:42:46,320
- Wow
- Now sit you down.

646
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:52,966
Ain't that the coup de grace?
I got her off from Taylor in Ponca City,

647
00:42:53,185 --> 00:42:55,486
before me and Colleen hooked up.
That was my deal closer, baby.

648
00:42:56,105 --> 00:42:59,539
If Colleen knew what went on in that
bed, she'd never let me [indistinct].

649
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:03,545
- Lovely. - Let's get you somethin'
for that buzz you got workin'.

650
00:43:03,585 --> 00:43:06,458
- Hey! Remember this?
- You still goin' with vinyl, huh?

651
00:43:06,665 --> 00:43:11,465
Oh, hell, yea! I don't go in for no digital.
They can't improve a phono classics man.

652
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,823
- Come on, lay you down.
- Lie down.

653
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:17,697
- Now you sound like mom.
- Sorry.

654
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:25,698
<i>Lady in a turban, a cocaine tree</i>

655
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:27,616
- How's that for a lullaby [indistinct].
- Ahhh...

656
00:43:30,617 --> 00:43:33,717
<i>Does a dance so rhythmically</i>

657
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:36,281
Hey, don't think that this
means that I'm in any way...

658
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:38,882
We ain't gonna talk
about that right now.

659
00:43:38,982 --> 00:43:41,682
<i>Having a time</i>

660
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,894
I'm just glad you're here, Billy.

661
00:43:46,095 --> 00:43:47,695
<i>Cocaine tree lookin' fine</i>

662
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:52,657
<i>Gotta put on your sailin' shoes.</i>

663
00:43:52,658 --> 00:43:57,228
<i>Put on your sailin' shoes</i>

664
00:43:57,229 --> 00:44:00,229
<i>Everyone will start to cheer</i>

665
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:07,430
<i>When you put on your sailin' shoes</i>

666
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:09,831
<i>Doctor, doctor, ahhh</i>

667
00:44:31,016 --> 00:44:33,016
Oh, cut it out.

668
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:36,999
How ya feelin', professor?

669
00:44:37,096 --> 00:44:41,789
- Mmmm, what did you do?
- Well, I bumped into some clippers.

670
00:44:42,775 --> 00:44:45,275
Hmm, feels weird.

671
00:44:47,135 --> 00:44:49,668
- Whaddya think?
- Ahhh...

672
00:44:51,574 --> 00:44:54,464
- Oh, God. What time is it?
- It's time to get up.

673
00:44:54,974 --> 00:44:56,787
Here, I bought you a few
things. Put 'em on.

674
00:44:56,888 --> 00:44:58,188
What? Why?

675
00:44:58,253 --> 00:45:00,887
Remember that thing we were
talkin' about [indistinct].

676
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:05,673
- No, no, Brady. That's... that's
just not gonna work. - Why?

677
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:07,900
Well, for one thing,
because you've given

678
00:45:07,901 --> 00:45:09,801
yourself the stupidest
haircut in human history.

679
00:45:09,892 --> 00:45:12,792
Oh, bullshit, you ain't that fancy.
Can't hardly tell the difference.

680
00:45:12,891 --> 00:45:14,892
No, I'm... I'm sorry, I never said...

681
00:45:14,972 --> 00:45:18,672
Haven't I fixed you up with Janet?
And then you like her?

682
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:22,912
My opinion of her is totally unrelated
to your infantile scheme.

683
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,551
You listen!

684
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,591
I ain't foolin'. You gotta help me,
because if I don't get up to Tulsa,

685
00:45:30,592 --> 00:45:32,392
I'm gonna be in some real trouble.

686
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,584
Then go up to Tulsa.
Why do I have to...

687
00:45:34,585 --> 00:45:36,485
Because some shit might
happen in Tulsa to where I...

688
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:39,889
Where... Where you would rather be seen
down here, so that you're not implicated in

689
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:43,090
whatever typically insane
criminal behavior that you intend.

690
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:44,996
No fucking way!

691
00:45:44,997 --> 00:45:47,797
All I'm askin' you to do
is go and see mom.

692
00:45:47,808 --> 00:45:49,808
That one little good deed.
That's all.

693
00:45:49,888 --> 00:45:53,155
Well, it's not a good deed,
and I really don't wanna see mom.

694
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:55,207
You come all the way down here!

695
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:58,008
No! No! You tricked me
into coming, actually.

696
00:45:58,038 --> 00:46:00,774
Oh! Please! It's...
It's so simple!

697
00:46:00,775 --> 00:46:02,975
All you gotta do is walk
into a fucking rest home

698
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:06,401
and see your own mother you ain't
seen in 12 years, for God knows why!

699
00:46:06,427 --> 00:46:08,940
I don't know why you wanna
pass a pig eatin' a bear claw.

700
00:46:08,946 --> 00:46:10,969
They don't call them that anymore.

701
00:46:10,987 --> 00:46:15,017
- What? - Nope! They aren't called
pigs anymore. That's exactly...

702
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:16,725
Called the police.

703
00:46:16,726 --> 00:46:18,952
How do you even know
that he'll be there?

704
00:46:19,053 --> 00:46:21,953
'Cuz he's got a shine on his heifer
who sits behind the desk.

705
00:46:22,005 --> 00:46:26,119
All you gotta do is walk in and say,
"Hi, ya, Sharon. I'm goin' to see my ma."

706
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,341
And don't say another fuckin' word.
And just walk on by.

707
00:46:28,444 --> 00:46:30,715
That is the most ridiculous alibi.

708
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:34,078
All anyone would have to do is find out that
you have a twin and that I was down here.

709
00:46:34,164 --> 00:46:36,877
When we ever been busted before?
You took tests for me all the time.

710
00:46:36,963 --> 00:46:41,844
- And I let you go on dates as me.
- No, I did that one time when we were 16.

711
00:46:41,963 --> 00:46:45,997
- And she guzzled your custard, didn't she?
- I have felt bad about that ever since.

712
00:46:46,163 --> 00:46:50,596
Come on, Billy.
I'm trying to change my life here.

713
00:46:50,722 --> 00:46:54,336
- Fucking hell.
- I'm asking, as your brother.

714
00:46:54,822 --> 00:46:57,489
Ugg.. I just walk by.

715
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:06,190
<i>I got kicked off of Noah's Ark
I turn my cheek to unkind remarks</i>

716
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:09,591
<i>There was two of everything
but one of me</i>

717
00:47:09,681 --> 00:47:12,781
- Say, ain't it Saturday?
- Yeah, so?

718
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,914
Think the Jews is in church Saturdays.
You know where it's at?

719
00:47:17,479 --> 00:47:21,693
- Can't we look it up?
- What if it's more'n one?

720
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,992
There can't be more than one.

721
00:47:29,439 --> 00:47:32,239
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot

722
00:47:33,439 --> 00:47:36,039
Do you believe in a higher power?

723
00:47:37,998 --> 00:47:41,791
Yea, I do. I do. It's the only
way to make sense of all this.

724
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,517
Otherwise, it's just pure fucking chaos.

725
00:47:45,277 --> 00:47:49,578
Like, the world was created by Him,
and He judges what we do?

726
00:47:49,996 --> 00:47:54,873
No, I think it's more
like, like parallel lines.

727
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:57,243
Parallel lines?

728
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:59,544
Ya know, like two lines go on and on
forever and don't ever touch.

729
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:02,845
Yea

730
00:48:02,915 --> 00:48:06,482
'Cept, 'cept they don't
actually exist in nature.

731
00:48:06,995 --> 00:48:12,329
And man can't create no true parallel.
It's just more of a concept.

732
00:48:12,954 --> 00:48:15,721
I learned that shit in
high school geometry.

733
00:48:15,722 --> 00:48:17,322
Ah huh

734
00:48:18,114 --> 00:48:21,998
Well, that concept, that perfection...

735
00:48:23,273 --> 00:48:26,907
We know it exists,
and we think about it.

736
00:48:27,313 --> 00:48:30,947
But we can't never
get there ourselves.

737
00:48:31,673 --> 00:48:34,573
I think that right there is God.

738
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:51,964
- You ready? - For what?
- Come on over here.

739
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:02,883
- Jesus!
- You just gonna stand there?

740
00:49:12,228 --> 00:49:15,162
You have a spiritual aversion
to monofilament?

741
00:49:18,787 --> 00:49:21,588
This is the way it was done
a thousand years ago.

742
00:49:22,307 --> 00:49:24,907
I think I can understand that.

743
00:49:26,027 --> 00:49:28,661
You still leavin' tomorrow?

744
00:49:29,346 --> 00:49:31,346
I think so.

745
00:49:31,547 --> 00:49:36,680
- I'll miss you.
- And we barely even know each other.

746
00:49:39,026 --> 00:49:41,593
<i>You have not known what you are.</i>

747
00:49:41,785 --> 00:49:44,452
<i>You have slumbered upon
yourself all your life.</i>

748
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:48,232
<i>Your eyelids have been the same
as closed most of the time.</i>

749
00:49:48,624 --> 00:49:51,725
<i>What you have done returns
already in mockeries.</i>

750
00:49:52,024 --> 00:49:54,424
<i>The mockeries are not you.</i>

751
00:49:54,704 --> 00:49:58,971
<i>Underneath them and within
them, I see you lurk.</i>

752
00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:08,303
- Who is that?
- Walt Whitman

753
00:50:09,223 --> 00:50:11,656
I don't think I ever imagined
hearing him recited to me by a

754
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:14,689
girl getting a 40-pound catfish.

755
00:50:15,342 --> 00:50:19,076
That's exactly how he should be recited.
He wrote without rhyme or meter.

756
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,749
Free verse... just
whatever he felt inside,

757
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:24,754
coming out in his own intricate rhythm.

758
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,994
Pure, unashamed passion,
without definable restriction.

759
00:50:30,221 --> 00:50:33,388
- I'm sorry, see, I ha.. have a few
issues with that. - Why?

760
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,914
Because some have dared to suggest
that even poetry has rules.

761
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,360
Or you make your own.

762
00:50:40,361 --> 00:50:42,961
Right there, that's the
part I never bought into.

763
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:46,353
- Because? - Because if everybody runs
around, making their own rules,

764
00:50:46,459 --> 00:50:49,460
how can you find what's true?

765
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:53,585
There's nothing... There's
nothing to rely on.

766
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,305
<i>One night,</i>

767
00:51:00,017 --> 00:51:02,484
<i>I [indistinct],</i>

768
00:51:02,658 --> 00:51:04,995
<i>devoured your leaves,</i>

769
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:08,917
<i>knowing no poison,
no love nourishment</i>

770
00:51:10,417 --> 00:51:14,517
<i>in that larval blindness,
a hunger finally true.</i>

771
00:51:18,456 --> 00:51:22,042
- Who's that?
- That's me.

772
00:51:29,975 --> 00:51:32,241
Maybe what's true is in front of us,

773
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:36,208
and we're moving toward it
without even knowing it's there.

774
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:40,347
Once you think you've got it all solved,

775
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,340
what's left?

776
00:51:51,373 --> 00:51:53,773
Don't get any fish innards on me, okay?

777
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:56,579
Shut up.

778
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,770
So, what is the Halakhah?

779
00:52:20,449 --> 00:52:22,449
It's the law.

780
00:52:22,689 --> 00:52:25,990
It's the path we follow
in our daily lives.

781
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:31,343
It comprises those rituals that
make our lives complete.

782
00:52:32,129 --> 00:52:36,029
Without them, the violence and
anarchy of the world prevail.

783
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:40,921
When Moses talks with
God on Sinai,

784
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:43,141
the Jews abandoned the law,

785
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,794
and danced ecstatically
before the calf,

786
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:49,234
forgetting the one who brought
them out of Egypt.

787
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:52,767
My friends, in every generation,
we are threatened

788
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:55,568
with chaos and slavery and despair.

789
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,973
And then this... this spirit
and confusion.

790
00:52:59,606 --> 00:53:03,840
Halakhah allows refuge in a
world we can't explain.

791
00:53:06,045 --> 00:53:07,712
Violence, anarchy

792
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:12,995
in which the workings of justice may falter,
there is a larger and deeper coherence.

793
00:53:13,964 --> 00:53:15,523
Who the fuck is that?

794
00:53:15,524 --> 00:53:19,324
To know this with certainty
is to belief as a Jew.

795
00:53:20,724 --> 00:53:23,957
Without law, we are lost

796
00:53:24,443 --> 00:53:26,163
Fuckin' faggot.

797
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:28,797
in an arid wasteland.
No good to each other.

798
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:30,298
Not this mess

799
00:53:30,399 --> 00:53:31,799
No good to our God.

800
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:34,109
- Shabbat Shalom
- AUDIENCE: Shabbat Shalom

801
00:53:35,802 --> 00:53:39,036
So, I would like to thank
the Taubmann family

802
00:53:39,037 --> 00:53:42,037
for the beautiful flowers
that adorn our bema,

803
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:47,475
and please join us after the
Musaf service for Kish [fades out]

804
00:53:56,801 --> 00:54:00,101
- Thanks for doing this.
- Happy to.

805
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,313
All right.

806
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,523
- You sure you don't wanna come in?
- I'll be waitin' right over there.

807
00:54:08,959 --> 00:54:13,726
But will look kindly later on boys who
sort shit out with their mamas.

808
00:54:15,078 --> 00:54:17,579
How do I look?

809
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:26,898
Well, hi ya, Sharon, just
goin' to see my mom.

810
00:54:28,237 --> 00:54:30,437
Officer

811
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:37,438
Oh, oh, oh, ah! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Wait! Wait!

812
00:54:37,956 --> 00:54:39,723
Oh, okay, okay, hang on, man!

813
00:54:39,824 --> 00:54:46,424
No, no, not a word from you, Brady,
you hear, you're just gonna listen.

814
00:54:46,435 --> 00:54:49,469
The staff here, they found your
mama smokin' pot the other day.

815
00:54:50,315 --> 00:54:52,982
Now she's a crazy lady, don't
even belong in here,

816
00:54:53,194 --> 00:54:55,928
but it wouldn't do nobody no
good to put her away.

817
00:54:56,274 --> 00:54:58,678
The only reason I ain't
haulin' you in is 'cuz

818
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:01,479
I ain't got proof it was
you give it to her.

819
00:55:01,513 --> 00:55:04,193
As soon as I do, we gonna get on
your property and we gonna

820
00:55:04,194 --> 00:55:09,327
find every last ounce of that super
charged grass you're growin' out there.

821
00:55:10,233 --> 00:55:14,699
I don't care how many money men you're
payin' off. You understand?

822
00:55:15,032 --> 00:55:17,466
Yessir.

823
00:55:27,071 --> 00:55:31,772
You ain't foolin' a soul
by cleanin' up.

824
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:38,698
I know just what you is.

825
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:48,330
That ain't at all what I asked you.

826
00:55:48,369 --> 00:55:54,136
I asked you why you was supposed
to be here three days ago,

827
00:55:54,137 --> 00:55:55,837
and you just walk in here now?

828
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:59,059
We just had some business back at home
we had to take care off, is all.

829
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:01,582
I heard you made an appearance
in Broken Bow.

830
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:05,761
Well, I just stopped in at
the Me Tote Em, there.

831
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,462
My girl wanted some licorice.

832
00:56:07,467 --> 00:56:10,554
Everybody knows those Fuller boys
work out of the Me Tote Em.

833
00:56:10,555 --> 00:56:13,455
Even the police know that.

834
00:56:13,467 --> 00:56:15,467
She wanted the licorice.

835
00:56:15,707 --> 00:56:18,774
I sure hope my money's in Yonder Bay.

836
00:56:18,946 --> 00:56:20,579
Well, that's just the thing.

837
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,780
Either that, or you got samples of what
you goin' be up to down there.

838
00:56:24,785 --> 00:56:27,952
Don't tell me you done interrupted
my day of rest.

839
00:56:28,025 --> 00:56:32,182
To other shit, I got no interest makin'
its way between my ears.

840
00:56:32,345 --> 00:56:34,545
We went to the wrong temple at first.

841
00:56:34,664 --> 00:56:36,831
- Temple Jester?
- Over on Utica.

842
00:56:37,425 --> 00:56:39,691
If I wanted to go to church,
I'd be a Krustian.

843
00:56:39,824 --> 00:56:41,583
Might make your life a little easier.

844
00:56:41,584 --> 00:56:43,617
Who says my life ain't easy?

845
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:46,657
I don't know. Maybe folks ain't
too partial to Jews.

846
00:56:46,783 --> 00:56:49,950
Law would never mark out a
Jew as a dope dealer, neither.

847
00:56:50,383 --> 00:56:52,983
They leave me alone,
by and large.

848
00:56:53,662 --> 00:56:55,929
The way of the world is mysterious,

849
00:56:56,542 --> 00:57:00,576
but every man has his place,
each accordin' to his lights.

850
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:02,021
That could be.

851
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:07,329
Shaver and Wendell done presented
to you a deal, Brady.

852
00:57:07,621 --> 00:57:14,421
Uh, opportunity. Now, either you
got my money in that bag,

853
00:57:14,741 --> 00:57:18,474
or we gonna talk about expanding
your situation down there.

854
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,960
Well, I can't do neither.

855
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,987
- Why not?
- I wanna have a family.

856
00:57:24,699 --> 00:57:27,966
I ain't never had a dad myself,
so I aim to be a good one.

857
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:30,626
So, I'm done. I might be
growin' for myself,

858
00:57:30,699 --> 00:57:32,999
but I ain't gonna be growing
for you or nobody no more.

859
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:35,217
At least, not in the
selling facet.

860
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:40,385
So, that's a bag full of money payin' me
back for settin' you up down there.

861
00:57:40,478 --> 00:57:43,397
- Well, now, hear me out, Pug.
- That's gettin' harder,

862
00:57:43,398 --> 00:57:44,931
because of all the shit I'm listenin' to.

863
00:57:44,937 --> 00:57:47,838
Okay, look. Me and Bolger. We gonna
take that whole operation

864
00:57:47,939 --> 00:57:50,739
that you paid for, we gonna
haul it up to Broken Bow.

865
00:57:50,777 --> 00:57:53,456
We gonna set it up, turn
it over to the Fuller brothers.

866
00:57:53,457 --> 00:57:56,057
I'm gonna teach them
everything I know.

867
00:57:57,816 --> 00:58:02,117
You can take Bobby Fuller and brain,
and stick it in the head of a cat,

868
00:58:02,536 --> 00:58:05,003
that animal will keel
over and die.

869
00:58:05,655 --> 00:58:10,179
- Me and Bolger will do whatever it takes.
- Who is paying me back?

870
00:58:10,415 --> 00:58:12,696
I'm working on that, but you ain't never
said nothing about a timetable.

871
00:58:12,975 --> 00:58:17,761
- Ohhh! It has been over a year, hadn't it?
- Yea, so?

872
00:58:18,174 --> 00:58:21,298
In all that time, have you heard
me ask you for a nickel?

873
00:58:21,694 --> 00:58:23,012
In all those 12 months?

874
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:25,710
No, but you and me both know I've
been selling you at a cut rate.

875
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:29,927
Ohhh! So! Now you
want me to be nice!

876
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:33,334
Well, I guess I do. What the fuck
is wrong with that?

877
00:58:33,533 --> 00:58:38,367
Brady, my people been kicked out of
near every country on this planet.

878
00:58:38,372 --> 00:58:42,906
My granddaddy came here, because
of the pogroms in Russia.

879
00:58:43,412 --> 00:58:48,312
He traveled all over the South,
selling czachkers out of a wagon,

880
00:58:48,411 --> 00:58:51,221
because nobody else wanted the job

881
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:53,671
of taking a wagon 50 miles a day.

882
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:58,624
Jews got good with money, because
Krustians didn't wanna touch it.

883
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:01,904
Now, Krustians say, Jews
got all the money.

884
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:03,768
I wonder how that happened?

885
00:59:03,769 --> 00:59:07,970
I give nearly every cent I make
to the State of Israel,

886
00:59:08,609 --> 00:59:15,206
because Israel is where we put our
foot down, and we said no more.

887
00:59:15,268 --> 00:59:18,332
We ain't gonna be took
advantage of no more!

888
00:59:18,769 --> 00:59:20,769
I would just like a little
more fucking time.

889
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:22,242
Well, ya know what I'd like?

890
00:59:22,243 --> 00:59:25,943
I'd like everybody in the world to call me
a cocksucker and give me a dollar!

891
00:59:25,977 --> 00:59:27,166
Why is that?

892
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:30,701
Because that way I'd be rich and
everybody'd love me!

893
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:40,166
Shaver, check that pickle. And if they ain't
got my money, kill those sons-of-bitches!

894
00:59:47,845 --> 00:59:50,946
Now, Pug, it ain't gotta go this way.

895
00:59:54,765 --> 00:59:56,765
Oh, bring it on, sonny.

896
00:59:58,205 --> 01:00:02,305
You tricked me, motherfucker!
I sure as shit gonna bleed.

897
01:00:15,323 --> 01:00:18,123
All right, shit! All right, shit!

898
01:00:20,282 --> 01:00:22,816
Get the spray paint!

899
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:28,975
Because Jesus is a loving and forgiving God,

900
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:33,208
He don't care where you've been.
He don't care whatcha done.

901
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:38,260
He just wants to love ya up, and
wants you to do the same to him.

902
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:41,634
Ya know, He was there
when you was born,

903
01:00:41,635 --> 01:00:45,135
and He just wants you back
again before you perish.

904
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:48,900
He loves ya and holds ya
and He comforts ya,

905
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,953
and gives ya everlasting rest,

906
01:00:52,439 --> 01:00:55,973
because Jesus is a compassionate God.

907
01:00:56,718 --> 01:01:01,419
Brings to mind the story of the old
man who's walking down the beach,

908
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:06,558
He stops and he's just... he's just
takin' in the glory of the creation.

909
01:01:06,758 --> 01:01:10,291
And, suddenly he realizes there's somebody
behind him, and he turns, and he looks,

910
01:01:10,457 --> 01:01:11,955
and it's Jesus!

911
01:01:11,956 --> 01:01:13,715
And he says, "Lord, Lord, if..."

912
01:01:13,716 --> 01:01:16,250
Are you listenin' to this bullshit?

913
01:01:17,756 --> 01:01:19,923
Hey, Mom.

914
01:01:25,076 --> 01:01:27,076
Billy?

915
01:01:30,475 --> 01:01:32,842
Well, you've got a nice view.

916
01:01:33,795 --> 01:01:36,596
I like watching the storms come in.

917
01:01:40,234 --> 01:01:42,335
You used to get so scared of 'em.

918
01:01:42,554 --> 01:01:44,554
Do ya still?

919
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:48,614
I don't think anything like that
scares me anymore.

920
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:53,800
If you aren't scared these days,
you aren't alive.

921
01:01:54,472 --> 01:01:57,939
I'm sure many people would agree with you.

922
01:01:58,112 --> 01:02:00,812
Coming here didn't scare you?

923
01:02:02,472 --> 01:02:05,959
- Nah, ah, maybe a little.
- Why?

924
01:02:06,471 --> 01:02:09,838
Ah, I didn't come here to have
that conversation, Daisy.

925
01:02:13,031 --> 01:02:18,930
So, one minute you were there, and
then you were gone. What happened?

926
01:02:18,951 --> 01:02:22,284
No, I'm... I'm serious, I'm really...
really not gonna do this.

927
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,363
Why, Billy?

928
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:28,683
Billy? Why?

929
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:33,723
All right. Because we
needed a mother,

930
01:02:34,388 --> 01:02:36,788
and not another friend
to get fucked up with.

931
01:02:36,949 --> 01:02:40,395
- I could be both.
- But you weren't both.

932
01:02:40,908 --> 01:02:43,708
Are you saying that I didn't raise you?

933
01:02:43,828 --> 01:02:47,095
I don't know what the
fuck you were doing.

934
01:02:47,307 --> 01:02:50,248
Reading every book you read,
every paper you wrote,

935
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:51,946
even when they were beyond me.

936
01:02:51,947 --> 01:02:53,786
I didn't need you to tell me I was smart,

937
01:02:53,787 --> 01:02:56,553
- I needed guidance.
- You never needed anything.

938
01:02:56,667 --> 01:02:59,200
- Brady did!
- You don't have to tell me about Brady.

939
01:02:59,706 --> 01:03:03,073
I... I don't need to be reminded. Don't you
think I know that every time he comes here?

940
01:03:03,306 --> 01:03:07,403
All I ever wanted was a
tiny taste of something

941
01:03:07,404 --> 01:03:09,704
resembling a normal
and rational life.

942
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:11,265
Where everything's a lie?

943
01:03:11,266 --> 01:03:13,966
Do you know that I actually
went away to school

944
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:16,667
and took a class in the
culture of the 60s,

945
01:03:17,004 --> 01:03:20,238
just to try to understand
the way you lived?

946
01:03:20,744 --> 01:03:22,313
The... The choices that you made,

947
01:03:22,314 --> 01:03:25,714
just to... to try to make sense out
of all that new freedom,

948
01:03:25,815 --> 01:03:29,015
and... and upheaval
and fucking anarchy?

949
01:03:29,104 --> 01:03:32,271
Ya know, and the... the problem is
you tore everything down,

950
01:03:32,343 --> 01:03:36,943
but you were too lazy to actually
build anything, as an alternative.

951
01:03:38,383 --> 01:03:41,683
As usual, you've got it all figured out.

952
01:03:46,702 --> 01:03:49,002
Am I ever gonna see you again?

953
01:03:49,622 --> 01:03:52,122
I don't know.
I don't think so.

954
01:03:54,261 --> 01:03:56,427
I'm sorry.

955
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,180
Yea, me, too.

956
01:03:59,681 --> 01:04:06,181
<i>They say everything can be replaced.</i>

957
01:04:06,682 --> 01:04:11,782
<i>They say every distance is not near.</i>

958
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:19,983
<i>So I remember everything
- [indistinct]</i>

959
01:04:21,339 --> 01:04:25,805
<i>- [indistinct]
Of every man who put me here.</i>

960
01:04:28,006 --> 01:04:33,606
<i>I see my light come shinin'</i>

961
01:04:35,907 --> 01:04:41,207
<i>From the west unto the east</i>

962
01:04:42,408 --> 01:04:44,008
<i>Any day now</i>

963
01:04:44,055 --> 01:04:48,256
- He's gonna get here in time.
- Ugh! Brady! Ugh! Oooh!

964
01:04:50,055 --> 01:04:52,055
[indistinct]

965
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:55,608
Now you tell Buddy, the next time
I slide into Broken Bow,

966
01:04:55,695 --> 01:04:59,728
if Bolger wants to shake a snake,
or if I just want a refreshin' potable,

967
01:04:59,735 --> 01:05:02,102
I expect a little more fucking time...

968
01:05:02,104 --> 01:05:11,904
<i>[Screaming on and on and on]
They say that every man must fall</i>

969
01:05:11,905 --> 01:05:17,005
<i>Yet I swear I see my reflection</i>

970
01:05:18,106 --> 01:05:23,506
<i>Somewhere so high above this wall</i>

971
01:05:25,572 --> 01:05:27,999
Jack Rothbaum, known as
Pug to his friends,

972
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:31,625
was a controversial figure in
Tulsa's small Jewish community.

973
01:05:31,891 --> 01:05:34,925
An enormous success in the
oil bill equipment business,

974
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:37,957
he gave millions of dollars
to the State of Israel,

975
01:05:38,211 --> 01:05:40,991
- as well as, other Jewish and
statewide causes. - Uh, oh.

976
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:45,144
Pug Rothbaum was a man of
generosity and valor.

977
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,757
Every nickel he made, most of it
went to help others,

978
01:05:48,809 --> 01:05:53,009
- Jews, Christians, everyone.
- He didn't. - What?

979
01:05:53,109 --> 01:05:55,910
Our community and the city of
Tulsa have lost a great man.

980
01:05:56,089 --> 01:06:00,923
Indeed, Pug Rothbaum's name adorns buildings
and signs all over our city and state,

981
01:06:01,448 --> 01:06:05,845
including various hospital wings,
his Museum of Indian Heritage,

982
01:06:05,968 --> 01:06:08,802
and this rest stop on the
Will Rogers Turnpike.

983
01:06:08,927 --> 01:06:11,761
Hey, y'all, we're home! Hey, buddy.

984
01:06:11,887 --> 01:06:15,454
- What have you done?
- What's it all about? - This?

985
01:06:15,887 --> 01:06:20,354
One curious aspect of this case is that
the swastikas were drawn backwards,

986
01:06:20,806 --> 01:06:22,673
indicating either haste

987
01:06:22,766 --> 01:06:26,533
or a lack of familiarity with this most
infamous of anti-Semitic emblems

988
01:06:26,686 --> 01:06:30,919
or, perhaps, rather more implausibly,
that Hindus were involved.

989
01:06:31,586 --> 01:06:32,844
I ain't no Hindu!

990
01:06:32,845 --> 01:06:35,479
The guy you owed money to,
a Jew up in Tulsa?

991
01:06:35,684 --> 01:06:37,098
Don't point your finger at me!
I've been with Bolger all day!

992
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:39,099
Oh! Come! Ugh! Hey, Billy! Hey!

993
01:06:39,124 --> 01:06:42,458
Ah! Calm 'er down now, I don't
want to upset Colleen. I mean it.

994
01:06:43,284 --> 01:06:47,791
- Tell me that you didn't do this.
- He was gonna kill us, and I had no choice.

995
01:06:48,123 --> 01:06:53,363
Ugh, ugh! You... You... You... You go to
the cops and explain things.

996
01:06:53,464 --> 01:06:57,864
You go and hide! You do anything
but that! And... And... What...

997
01:06:57,883 --> 01:06:59,283
What were those swastikas?

998
01:06:59,363 --> 01:07:02,430
Well, those were the symbols that
the Nazis put on all their little trinkets.

999
01:07:02,642 --> 01:07:05,242
I... I... I'm familiar with the
contextual history of the swastika.

1000
01:07:05,282 --> 01:07:07,949
Why would you want it to
look like a hate crime?

1001
01:07:08,121 --> 01:07:09,601
So it don't look like a drug crime!

1002
01:07:09,602 --> 01:07:11,769
Great! Perfect! Just...
just confirm that we're the

1003
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:14,070
rednecked hick state that
everybody thinks we are.

1004
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:15,960
Don't you talk down on Oklahoma!

1005
01:07:15,961 --> 01:07:19,662
How? How is it possible that
you are so brilliant,

1006
01:07:19,741 --> 01:07:22,948
and so monumentally, selfishly
ignorant at the same time?

1007
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,181
Oh, look! When you ever been in a
situation you had to fight your way out of?

1008
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,199
Whether it was you or someone else?

1009
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,880
I don't put myself in
those kind of situations!

1010
01:07:29,981 --> 01:07:31,981
Well, that's the real world, Billy.
I hate to tell ya,

1011
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,259
and if you had to kill
someone to protect you

1012
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,860
or your own, you'd do
the same thing I done.

1013
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,966
I got a baby coming.

1014
01:07:40,638 --> 01:07:42,972
I... I... I am leaving tomorrow.

1015
01:07:44,837 --> 01:07:46,700
You gonna turn me in?

1016
01:07:46,701 --> 01:07:51,701
No. I don't know. I don't know
what I'm going to do!

1017
01:07:51,758 --> 01:07:55,625
Listen, listen. This guy. He hauled
drugs all over this state.

1018
01:07:55,957 --> 01:07:59,291
- You said he didn't sell.
- He sold to the ones what sold 'em.

1019
01:07:59,556 --> 01:08:01,823
All right? Now, he will come
down here to force me

1020
01:08:02,024 --> 01:08:04,624
to explain the shit I don't
even wanna talk about.

1021
01:08:04,716 --> 01:08:07,119
They're gonna find you,
and you're gonna get killed,

1022
01:08:07,556 --> 01:08:11,109
or you're gonna go to jail, and then
where are your wife and kid gonna be?

1023
01:08:11,236 --> 01:08:14,936
That's the beauty of it.
Well, I wasn't up there.

1024
01:08:14,937 --> 01:08:17,137
I was down here. Remember?

1025
01:08:17,255 --> 01:08:18,955
Ah! You asshole!

1026
01:08:20,035 --> 01:08:21,935
Do you have any idea
what you're doin' to me?

1027
01:08:21,936 --> 01:08:23,336
Son of a bitch!

1028
01:08:26,794 --> 01:08:28,794
Billy! Ugh!

1029
01:08:29,454 --> 01:08:34,854
- You are going to ruin my life!
- Ain't nobody gonna know! Ugh!

1030
01:08:36,473 --> 01:08:39,073
[Phone ringing]

1031
01:08:39,174 --> 01:08:40,974
Go answer the phone.

1032
01:08:41,712 --> 01:08:45,246
- Colleen'll get it!
- Just answer the fucking phone!

1033
01:08:49,952 --> 01:08:51,952
Hello?

1034
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:55,012
No, it ain't. It's his brother.

1035
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:59,224
- Who... Who is it?
- Well, he's right here, I know.

1036
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:02,430
Hello?

1037
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:05,731
- Bill, ah, Nathan Levy.
- Nathan?

1038
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:12,210
Ah... How did.. How did you get this number?

1039
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:16,910
I hope you don't mind. I, ah, spoke to
Maggie Harmon down at Brown.

1040
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:20,329
Is this a bad time?

1041
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:24,130
It's fine. Ah, you know what?
Hang on one second.

1042
01:09:31,347 --> 01:09:33,247
Sorry, Nathan, go ahead.

1043
01:09:33,347 --> 01:09:38,128
Well, you didn't hear this from me, Bill.
But you're about to be ambushed down there.

1044
01:09:39,106 --> 01:09:42,627
- By whom?
- Something about a coed and a poem,

1045
01:09:43,226 --> 01:09:45,926
and some other behavior, which I would
rather allow you to infer.

1046
01:09:46,027 --> 01:09:49,387
What? You've got to be kidding me.
Nobody would say that.

1047
01:09:49,466 --> 01:09:52,232
Apparently there was
a witness, Bill.

1048
01:09:54,505 --> 01:09:57,639
Nathan... Nate... Nathan, listen to me.

1049
01:09:57,705 --> 01:10:00,905
- That is absurd.
- That's why I'm reaching out.

1050
01:10:01,465 --> 01:10:05,498
But until whatever happened
blows over, we can't...

1051
01:10:05,599 --> 01:10:06,899
I understand.

1052
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:10,204
- Everything all right?
- No, it isn't.

1053
01:10:10,784 --> 01:10:12,663
Now, where can I find the signal for this?

1054
01:10:12,664 --> 01:10:16,364
I wrote a poem for you in Latin
for when you got back.

1055
01:10:16,542 --> 01:10:19,343
It was incentive of Virgil
in dactylic hexameter,

1056
01:10:19,443 --> 01:10:23,423
and it was all about what would happen
if we were together in the [indistinct].

1057
01:10:23,503 --> 01:10:26,990
Stop. Inappropriate. I
don't wanna hear it.

1058
01:10:27,461 --> 01:10:31,405
So, I was in the library, and Mark Laub
read it over my shoulder.

1059
01:10:31,501 --> 01:10:34,215
He site-translated it?
Oh, no, he was really good.

1060
01:10:34,622 --> 01:10:36,755
He had like five hortatory subjunctives.

1061
01:10:36,842 --> 01:10:41,009
Anne, didn't you tell him that it was just a
fucking poem, that it never happened?

1062
01:10:41,181 --> 01:10:44,314
Yes, but he didn't believe me, so
he went to the Department.

1063
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:49,584
I guess he was really pissed about some B+
you gave him on a Lucretius paper last year.

1064
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:51,458
Fucking hell!

1065
01:10:51,459 --> 01:10:55,613
- Did you give him a B+?
- I don't remember, Anne.

1066
01:10:55,699 --> 01:10:59,500
So, that bitch, Maggie Harmon,
said she caught us that day

1067
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:03,058
- making out with my shirt
off in your office. - Ohhh!

1068
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:07,806
So, I went to her, and I told
her the truth, and I begged her.

1069
01:11:07,977 --> 01:11:11,644
But the door was closed, and I was
partially undressed.

1070
01:11:11,818 --> 01:11:14,236
And then Professor Lockwood said that,

1071
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:16,938
in a world of phenomena,
appearances are truth.

1072
01:11:17,297 --> 01:11:19,990
Going around quoting the cynics.
He's such a fucking lightweight!

1073
01:11:20,257 --> 01:11:25,757
- I don't.. I don't wanna hear any more.
- Bill! When are you coming home?

1074
01:11:26,736 --> 01:11:29,170
Stop it!
I told you to leave Stacy alone!

1075
01:11:29,815 --> 01:11:31,915
She's been on my nerves since Hebrew school.

1076
01:11:32,016 --> 01:11:34,083
- Eat shit, Gabe!
- Well, after you eat mine!

1077
01:11:34,084 --> 01:11:36,084
Don't you dare speak to anyone
that way, Stacy Feinman!

1078
01:11:37,175 --> 01:11:39,189
He cusses all the time!
And so do you!

1079
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:41,390
You both make spectacles
of yourselves back there!

1080
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,407
The pizza there sucks compared
to the pizza in New York!

1081
01:11:44,408 --> 01:11:47,808
Well, it is the pizza that we have!

1082
01:11:47,814 --> 01:11:50,547
And, by the way, did I hear you
ask your mother for money?

1083
01:11:50,654 --> 01:11:52,167
Honey, I don't wanna talk about it.

1084
01:11:52,168 --> 01:11:53,968
- Don't you have any pride?
- Of course, I do.

1085
01:11:53,974 --> 01:11:57,960
- It's your mother!
- We're strangling, Suzie. Strangling!

1086
01:11:58,073 --> 01:12:00,073
The credit card bills alone.

1087
01:12:00,123 --> 01:12:03,960
- Now, until I get my practice up...
- When? When? - I told you. I told you.

1088
01:12:04,003 --> 01:12:07,167
It's when the kids make friends at school,
and we meet the parents.

1089
01:12:07,192 --> 01:12:10,092
I hate the kids at school! They suck!
They're a bunch of idiots!

1090
01:12:10,252 --> 01:12:14,219
A brutal murder occurred earlier today,
after Mr. Rothbaum attended Sabbath services.

1091
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:17,145
- I said, when?
- Yea, Dad? - Shh! Everyone be quiet!

1092
01:12:17,222 --> 01:12:22,170
Sources close to the investigation
say it was a hate crime.

1093
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:25,844
Mr. Rothbaum was last seen alive
at approximately 1:00 pm

1094
01:12:25,931 --> 01:12:30,464
by fellow worshippers in
Congregation Nevei Kodesh, here in Tulsa.

1095
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:36,576
I'm supposed to get three kids
out of the car by myself?

1096
01:12:36,609 --> 01:12:38,743
Just give me a minute!

1097
01:12:39,195 --> 01:12:41,195
Bill Kincaid

1098
01:12:52,328 --> 01:12:54,928
Hugo Central High School

1099
01:13:17,445 --> 01:13:21,546
Honey! I'm just gonna, ah...
Don't wait up for me!

1100
01:13:22,324 --> 01:13:23,843
What?

1101
01:13:23,844 --> 01:13:27,944
Well, 180 dollars will limit ya, but it
don't mean you can't put a bullet

1102
01:13:28,012 --> 01:13:29,763
in there that's gonna pack a wallop.

1103
01:13:29,764 --> 01:13:32,798
I... I really don't need...
need the bullets.

1104
01:13:33,084 --> 01:13:36,610
None of my business, friend, but you carry
a firearm, you'd better be ready to use it.

1105
01:13:36,643 --> 01:13:40,844
Uh, huh. Well, ah, see, it's... it's
really more for protection.

1106
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:44,230
Now, these here is hollow points.

1107
01:13:45,122 --> 01:13:49,956
I... I appreciate that, but, um,
like I said, I... I'm content...

1108
01:13:50,002 --> 01:13:53,903
Dog eat dog. You wanna be the
one who's chowin' down.

1109
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:57,868
I really don't... I don't plan to chow down.

1110
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:02,520
I'll just take the gun.

1111
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:07,454
Yup, nope. Well, that's what... honey,
you just got to trust me on this.

1112
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,167
Yes, right.

1113
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,560
Tomorrow night at the latest.

1114
01:14:14,919 --> 01:14:17,419
Just give 'em... Give everyone a big kiss.

1115
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:32,559
And I'm telling you, you was at
that rest home, plain as day.

1116
01:14:32,638 --> 01:14:34,972
And Erica. Looked like a choirboy.

1117
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:38,904
So, how could he have been
there, here, and in Tulsa?

1118
01:14:39,197 --> 01:14:41,798
He was in Tulsa before
he was here.

1119
01:14:41,997 --> 01:14:44,390
This is one big waste of my time.

1120
01:14:44,477 --> 01:14:48,510
And I tell you what else! I'd better
not hear about any vigilante bullshit.

1121
01:14:48,756 --> 01:14:51,889
And you know why he
would've been in Tulsa?

1122
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:53,690
No, Buddy, educate me!

1123
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:58,093
Because him and Pug Rothbaum was fixin'
to make a lot more than grass down here.

1124
01:14:58,195 --> 01:15:00,996
- Who told you that?
- Pug Rothbaum

1125
01:15:01,115 --> 01:15:03,515
He was gonna push me and
Jimmy out of Broken Bow.

1126
01:15:04,154 --> 01:15:08,522
He was into Pug for more than $200,000
for the equipment in his grow house.

1127
01:15:09,234 --> 01:15:11,768
You tellin' me the truth, Buddy?

1128
01:15:23,872 --> 01:15:28,173
Ya know, there's... there's rumored to be

1129
01:15:29,179 --> 01:15:33,189
excellent noodling in the
rivers around Boston.

1130
01:15:37,251 --> 01:15:39,218
How about that.

1131
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:43,017
Something you might want to confirm.

1132
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:48,070
Okay

1133
01:16:05,268 --> 01:16:06,535
Hey

1134
01:16:09,136 --> 01:16:11,636
You ain't gonna stop off and
see mom one more time?

1135
01:16:11,668 --> 01:16:13,668
I don't think so.

1136
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:16,528
Well, I'll see ya when I see ya.

1137
01:16:19,787 --> 01:16:21,787
Hello, there.

1138
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:27,147
You have got to be kidding me.

1139
01:16:29,266 --> 01:16:33,207
- You know this guy?
- Sort of.

1140
01:16:34,146 --> 01:16:36,646
- Well, I'll be damned.
- How can we help ya?

1141
01:16:36,946 --> 01:16:40,613
Okay, ah, which of you was it
I met on the airplane?

1142
01:16:41,465 --> 01:16:44,965
You! And you murdered Pug Rothbaum!

1143
01:16:49,065 --> 01:16:52,631
- Get in the house! Get in the house!
- No! Don't go there! Don't go there!

1144
01:16:53,104 --> 01:16:56,437
- Over there!
- Just calm down! Just calm down!

1145
01:16:56,543 --> 01:16:57,610
Calm down! It's all right!

1146
01:16:57,611 --> 01:17:00,111
No, no, you get back...
Get back... No, no...

1147
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:04,636
No, no, no... Back! Back!

1148
01:17:07,062 --> 01:17:09,992
- I got hollow points!
- Hollow points?

1149
01:17:10,223 --> 01:17:12,956
Join it! Join over! Get in the
cluster! Get in the cluster!

1150
01:17:15,061 --> 01:17:19,095
No, this is not happening.
I've got a plane to catch.

1151
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,968
Well, I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

1152
01:17:22,141 --> 01:17:24,041
You are not pointing that gun at me.

1153
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:26,514
- Join the group!
- This is not happening!

1154
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:30,860
- Join the group!
- Billy, Billy, come on.

1155
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:34,549
Thank you!

1156
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,613
Now, lis..., now, listen.
Wha... Wha... Wha...

1157
01:17:35,614 --> 01:17:37,614
Why don't you stop waving
that thing around?

1158
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:39,386
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

1159
01:17:39,387 --> 01:17:41,387
No, all right. Then let's... let's just
put the gun down, then.

1160
01:17:41,419 --> 01:17:43,337
I just wanna talk.

1161
01:17:43,338 --> 01:17:48,505
- Why are you doing this?
- You flew down here to be his alibi.

1162
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:54,912
Making him a murderer, and you an
accessory, and this is a Christian state.

1163
01:17:56,118 --> 01:17:58,618
We're very Old Testament,
when it comes to murder.

1164
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:02,518
He'll get the chair, and you'll get life!

1165
01:18:02,696 --> 01:18:05,197
Who the fuck is this guy?

1166
01:18:06,097 --> 01:18:08,300
You're an orthodontist.

1167
01:18:08,356 --> 01:18:12,883
I am drowning in debt! I've been
trying to set up a new practice,

1168
01:18:13,396 --> 01:18:17,350
but I still owe on the insurance
premiums from the last one!

1169
01:18:17,535 --> 01:18:21,252
Plus all the equipment!
I have a wife and three kids!

1170
01:18:21,376 --> 01:18:22,994
Why don't you get to the fucking point?

1171
01:18:22,995 --> 01:18:26,548
Until my kids can make friends
at school, and we meet their parents!

1172
01:18:26,615 --> 01:18:28,613
No, no, no, listen. Bill, Bill, hey, Bill!

1173
01:18:28,614 --> 01:18:33,315
- I am a guy that you met on an airplane!
- Keep back! Keep back! I said keep back!

1174
01:18:33,414 --> 01:18:36,701
- Really, really, please.
- I really mean it.

1175
01:18:36,783 --> 01:18:39,000
Get the hell back!

1176
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:45,290
Pull the trigger. Put a bullet
in my skull. I give up. It's perfect.

1177
01:19:02,211 --> 01:19:04,912
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1178
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:08,610
It's fine. Just go home.

1179
01:19:08,691 --> 01:19:11,664
- Billy, we can't let him go now.
- We are.

1180
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:16,417
Just let it go, and
everybody just go home.

1181
01:19:19,818 --> 01:19:20,918
Go, go.

1182
01:19:21,429 --> 01:19:23,049
-Brady! Brady!
- Hey, hey, you!

1183
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,450
Where do ya think you're going?

1184
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:26,750
- Get back!
- Aaahhh!

1185
01:19:28,751 --> 01:19:29,851
- Bill, no!
- Aaahhh!

1186
01:19:35,852 --> 01:19:36,952
Brady!

1187
01:19:43,247 --> 01:19:45,380
Janet, call 911!

1188
01:19:45,967 --> 01:19:48,700
Baby, I think my mama
might have called it.

1189
01:19:49,407 --> 01:19:52,073
She might have been right!

1190
01:19:56,326 --> 01:19:58,593
Police coming.

1191
01:20:00,185 --> 01:20:04,085
Bill. Hey, Bill!

1192
01:20:04,445 --> 01:20:06,945
We're gonna need an EMT.

1193
01:20:07,165 --> 01:20:11,965
- Bill... Hey, Bill!
- Bill... Bill... Bill...

1194
01:20:13,244 --> 01:20:15,278
Gimme that! Gimme it.

1195
01:20:17,364 --> 01:20:19,697
Look at me... at me...

1196
01:20:20,363 --> 01:20:22,663
Go see that rabbi up in Tulsa.

1197
01:20:23,283 --> 01:20:27,416
All those drawings we did at Pug's.
Tell her we didn't mean nothing by 'em.

1198
01:20:28,963 --> 01:20:31,096
Just promise me. You promise me?

1199
01:20:31,842 --> 01:20:34,309
You're gonna tell her yourself.

1200
01:20:38,942 --> 01:20:42,709
Okay. Now you ain't killed nobody.

1201
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:55,887
Diogenes Laertius has recorded for us
the Greek philosopher, Epicurus's

1202
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:58,020
thoughts on death.

1203
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,987
It is irrational to fear an event,

1204
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:04,679
if when that event occurs,
we are not in existence.

1205
01:21:05,739 --> 01:21:11,730
And, since when death is, we are not,
and when we are, death is not,

1206
01:21:12,518 --> 01:21:15,385
then it's irrational to fear death.

1207
01:21:16,198 --> 01:21:18,532
One might just as well, Epicurus argued,

1208
01:21:19,157 --> 01:21:21,791
fear birth.

1209
01:21:22,997 --> 01:21:26,964
I was born just a few minutes
before my brother, Brady.

1210
01:21:28,637 --> 01:21:34,436
He lived life on his own terms,
indifferent to fear,

1211
01:21:35,036 --> 01:21:38,670
either his own, or those of others.

1212
01:21:39,355 --> 01:21:41,889
And, let's be honest.

1213
01:21:44,115 --> 01:21:50,115
By any normal measure, my brother
was a criminal and a colossal fuckup.

1214
01:21:52,554 --> 01:21:56,548
But, in the years that we were together,

1215
01:21:58,513 --> 01:22:00,880
when we were growing up,

1216
01:22:02,114 --> 01:22:06,647
he gave me the happiest, freest times

1217
01:22:08,712 --> 01:22:11,579
that I will ever know.

1218
01:22:12,552 --> 01:22:16,053
I don't know why it took
me so long to realize that.

1219
01:22:16,912 --> 01:22:21,542
I left Little Dixie because of my own fears.

1220
01:22:24,511 --> 01:22:27,111
My greatest regret is that

1221
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:31,965
I never told him how
difficult that really was.

1222
01:22:44,529 --> 01:22:46,829
Bolger, how'd you get those scars?

1223
01:22:47,389 --> 01:22:50,489
- Prison, with your brother.
- My brother wasn't in prison.

1224
01:22:50,908 --> 01:22:56,575
Two years on possession. I think he
ain't wanted you to know that.

1225
01:22:57,307 --> 01:22:59,441
Saved my life, too.

1226
01:23:00,027 --> 01:23:04,514
Three guys jumped me with box cutters.
Your brother, Brady, went berserk.

1227
01:23:05,068 --> 01:23:07,668
Kept the both of us alive in there.

1228
01:23:10,706 --> 01:23:13,773
Can't believe he never...

1229
01:23:14,246 --> 01:23:17,313
Wished I could've repaid the favor.

1230
01:23:17,314 --> 01:23:20,514
<i>So tell my baby I said so long</i>

1231
01:23:20,515 --> 01:23:23,115
<i>Tell my mother I did no wrong</i>

1232
01:23:23,116 --> 01:23:26,116
<i>Tell my brother to watch his own</i>

1233
01:23:26,217 --> 01:23:28,917
<i>Tell my friends to mourn me none</i>

1234
01:23:33,918 --> 01:23:36,918
<i>I'm chained upon the face of time</i>

1235
01:23:36,919 --> 01:23:40,219
<i>Feelin' full of foolish rhyme</i>

1236
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:43,020
<i>There ain't no dark till something shines</i>

1237
01:23:43,021 --> 01:23:47,421
<i>I'm bound to leave this dark behind</i>

1238
01:23:50,502 --> 01:23:53,336
So, to what do I owe this visit?

1239
01:23:55,222 --> 01:23:58,155
My brother killed Pug Rothbaum.

1240
01:23:59,742 --> 01:24:01,409
Your brother?

1241
01:24:01,481 --> 01:24:07,681
Who's the... same man who was
shot by Ken Feinman.

1242
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:11,827
Have you told the police?

1243
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:15,160
I will.

1244
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:23,834
He wanted you to know
that it wasn't a hate crime.

1245
01:24:24,379 --> 01:24:27,513
I find it hard to believe your brother
didn't have something against Jews.

1246
01:24:27,939 --> 01:24:30,439
I know, but he didn't.

1247
01:24:33,459 --> 01:24:36,259
Then I'll have to believe you.

1248
01:24:42,337 --> 01:24:44,538
Is there something else?

1249
01:24:46,697 --> 01:24:49,497
Why... Why do you think...

1250
01:24:51,616 --> 01:24:53,616
Why do we...

1251
01:24:53,897 --> 01:24:57,264
We are animals, Professor Kincaid.

1252
01:25:00,456 --> 01:25:03,823
Brains that trick us into
thinking we aren't.

1253
01:25:04,655 --> 01:25:07,255
What do I... What can I do with that?

1254
01:25:07,935 --> 01:25:10,035
- Repair.
- What?

1255
01:25:10,614 --> 01:25:12,815
All of us. You, me,

1256
01:25:13,414 --> 01:25:15,881
your brother, Pug...

1257
01:25:18,974 --> 01:25:21,241
We break the world.

1258
01:25:23,933 --> 01:25:26,634
Help repair it.

1259
01:26:11,228 --> 01:26:15,795
Hey, come on over here.

1260
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:35,087
- What's this about, Bolger?
- I'll let Billy speak.

1261
01:26:35,926 --> 01:26:38,027
Have a seat.

1262
01:26:40,205 --> 01:26:42,806
Well, go on. Say whatcha got to say.

1263
01:26:43,485 --> 01:26:47,185
- My brother had a lot of equipment.
- His grow house. - Yea

1264
01:26:48,845 --> 01:26:52,605
We talked to a lawyer.
The police can't confiscate it.

1265
01:26:53,165 --> 01:26:55,865
Now, it's a high quality system.
It's hydroponic.

1266
01:26:56,564 --> 01:26:59,364
I'm proposing to sell it to you.

1267
01:27:00,444 --> 01:27:02,911
That's the whole list.

1268
01:27:03,563 --> 01:27:05,863
That's at a... a discount price.

1269
01:27:09,563 --> 01:27:11,929
Yea, well, I don't see it quite like this.

1270
01:27:13,723 --> 01:27:15,361
Why not?

1271
01:27:15,362 --> 01:27:19,163
Because your brother never paid
Pug for that equipment.

1272
01:27:20,082 --> 01:27:22,842
- So what?
- So why I gotta pay you for it?

1273
01:27:23,281 --> 01:27:28,341
Because my brother is dead.
I have to cover funeral costs.

1274
01:27:28,801 --> 01:27:30,501
He had bills that weren't paid.

1275
01:27:30,502 --> 01:27:33,502
He had a mortgage, and his wife
is expecting a baby now.

1276
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:37,114
Okay, all I'm trying to do
is to cover his debts

1277
01:27:37,115 --> 01:27:39,415
and leave his family
with a little something.

1278
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,879
- Can you understand that?
- Well, I'm one of his debts, see.

1279
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:46,673
Ya know, before your brother and
Bolger got out of the penitentiary,

1280
01:27:46,879 --> 01:27:49,946
I had this whole area,
southeastern Oklahoma.

1281
01:27:50,359 --> 01:27:53,293
And Pug Rothbaum come
to me for his grass!

1282
01:27:54,038 --> 01:27:58,472
And now you're going to have all of that
again and better product besides.

1283
01:27:59,038 --> 01:28:00,877
Your brother owes
me that equipment!

1284
01:28:00,878 --> 01:28:04,411
Come on, man! Don't you
want to repair the world?

1285
01:28:05,278 --> 01:28:10,798
- What? - We're breaking the world!
Don't you want to fucking repair it?

1286
01:28:10,917 --> 01:28:15,247
What I want is for you to give me that
equipment and then to go back East

1287
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:19,289
with all the other faggots who think that
New York City is the only place on Earth.

1288
01:28:19,476 --> 01:28:22,289
- I don't live in New York.
- Well, that don't mean that

1289
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:23,890
you don't think you're better
than us! Now, do it.

1290
01:28:23,915 --> 01:28:28,382
You know what? We are better than you!
We use our powers of thought!

1291
01:28:28,515 --> 01:28:31,449
- Don't you turn your back on me!
- Fucking hick!

1292
01:28:32,194 --> 01:28:36,342
- Don't you walk away!
- Just keep walking. Don't look back.

1293
01:28:36,914 --> 01:28:39,007
- Watt's wife.
- Who?

1294
01:28:39,274 --> 01:28:42,241
She turned into a pillar of salt.

1295
01:28:44,113 --> 01:28:46,113
Motherfucker.

1296
01:28:53,053 --> 01:28:55,553
Help! Help me!

1297
01:28:55,712 --> 01:28:57,311
- I can't.
- Get it out!

1298
01:28:57,312 --> 01:29:00,012
It's a bow. I think got a fletchette.

1299
01:29:34,774 --> 01:29:40,174
Oh, my God! No, no, no!

1300
01:30:09,615 --> 01:30:11,915
He's been shot! Fuckin' arrow!

1301
01:30:46,061 --> 01:30:48,928
Folks, wanna come with me.

1302
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:58,694
Now, the arrow missed
his heart by an inch

1303
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:01,547
and his spine by centimeters.

1304
01:31:02,139 --> 01:31:04,573
So, what does this mean for him?

1305
01:31:05,219 --> 01:31:07,919
Well, it'll be a long recovery.

1306
01:31:08,279 --> 01:31:13,699
I guess I don't need to tell ya this,
but you saved his life.

1307
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:32,700
[Baby crying]
Yes, yes, yes, dear...

1308
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:35,104
Billy, it's fixin' to rain.

1309
01:31:38,256 --> 01:31:40,457
Thanks, mom.

1310
01:31:53,054 --> 01:31:56,721
Think I'm just gonna
sit here for awhile.

1311
01:31:57,415 --> 01:31:59,648
In the rain?

1312
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:05,174
I used to be so scared of
these summer storms.

1313
01:32:06,253 --> 01:32:09,253
And when I went East,
I missed them.

1314
01:32:10,013 --> 01:32:12,990
I was so frightened, I used to hide in
the closet and cover my ears.

1315
01:32:13,613 --> 01:32:15,713
And I hated that.

1316
01:32:16,052 --> 01:32:20,220
So, I went to the library,
and I studied them.

1317
01:32:21,212 --> 01:32:26,466
Learned everything I could about them.
How they happened. What made them happen.

1318
01:32:26,512 --> 01:32:28,512
The name of every cloud.

1319
01:32:28,851 --> 01:32:30,851
And?

1320
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:34,758
They still happened.

1321
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:38,304
Mind if I stay out here with you?

1322
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:41,530
I wish you would.

1323
01:33:01,047 --> 01:33:03,031
<i>Lonely are the free</i>

1324
01:33:03,732 --> 01:33:05,432
<i>'Cuz there ain't that many of 'em</i>

1325
01:33:05,933 --> 01:33:08,233
<i>They don't walk like you and me</i>

1326
01:33:11,834 --> 01:33:14,134
<i>They just tumble in the breeze</i>

1327
01:33:14,835 --> 01:33:19,035
<i>Lighter than a feather all
together separately</i>

1328
01:33:22,736 --> 01:33:30,436
<i>That's how it supposed to be, no matter
where they wander, from post to in-between</i>

1329
01:33:30,637 --> 01:33:35,637
<i>From here to over yonder,
there's no place for them to land</i>

1330
01:33:39,538 --> 01:33:45,038
<i>Lonely are the free</i>

1331
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:54,839
<i>The silent are the strong, not so much as
a whisper, tell ya anything is wrong</i>

1332
01:33:55,040 --> 01:34:00,240
<i>You've known all along that you
can't help but listen</i>

1333
01:34:00,541 --> 01:34:03,941
<i>And now the moment's gone</i>

1334
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:14,642
<i>It keeps you hanging on until the
stillness signaling the breaking of the dawn</i>

1335
01:34:14,643 --> 01:34:21,743
<i>is shattered by the sirens,
singing sacrificial songs</i>

1336
01:34:23,044 --> 01:34:27,644
<i> The silent are the strong</i>

1337
01:34:29,645 --> 01:34:49,645
