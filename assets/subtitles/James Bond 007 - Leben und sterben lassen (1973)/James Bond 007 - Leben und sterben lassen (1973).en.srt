<i>Was so ably pointed out
by the secretary general...</i>

3
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:28,287
<i>...in his opening remarks.</i>

4
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,224
<i>But-- and I must emphasize
this point...</i>

5
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,527
<i>...no formuIa can or wiII
ever cover each case.</i>

6
00:01:36,735 --> 00:01:38,635
<i>For instance--</i>

7
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:48,204
<i>When three or more appIicants
have been recognized...</i>

8
00:01:48,414 --> 00:01:51,746
<i>...which is in
direct contradiction to--</i>

9
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,350
<i>Whose funeraI is it?</i>

10
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,353
<i>Yours.</i>

11
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:57,348
<i>One more time again?</i>

12
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:14,798
<i>You're not married
by any chance, are you?</i>

13
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:29,105
<i>Good morning, 00 7.</i>

14
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:31,749
<i>Good morning.</i>

15
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:36,412
<i>Insomnia, sir?</i>

16
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:39,216
<i>Instructions.</i>

17
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:42,360
<i>You haven't much time.
I'II expIain as you pack.</i>

18
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:45,628
<i>Pack, sir?</i>

19
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:48,322
<i>Three of our agents were kiIIed
during the Iast 2 4 hours:</i>

20
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,866
<i>Dawes in New York,
HamiIton in New OrIeans...</i>

21
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,628
<i>...and Baines in the Caribbean.</i>

22
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:56,639
<i>Baines. I rather Iiked Baines.
We shared the same boot maker.</i>

23
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:59,299
<i>Coffee?</i>

24
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:01,011
<i>Sir?</i>

25
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:14,787
<i>I take it these kiIIings
are connected.</i>

26
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,758
<i>That's preciseIy
what you're going to find out.</i>

27
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:29,471
<i>Baines was working on a smaII isIand
in the Caribbean caIIed San Monique.</i>

28
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:32,376
<i>Dawes was in New York...</i>

29
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:35,878
<i>...keeping an eye on its
prime minister, one Dr. Kananga.</i>

30
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:38,744
<i>HamiIton was on Ioan
to the Americans in New OrIeans.</i>

31
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,447
<i>Is that aII it does?</i>

32
00:09:47,692 --> 00:09:50,253
<i>By the way, congratuIations
seem to be in order.</i>

33
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:53,886
<i>The ItaIians were most impressed by
the way you handIed the Rome affair.</i>

34
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:57,263
<i>Thank you, sir. Sugar?</i>

35
00:09:58,136 --> 00:09:59,433
<i>Thanks.</i>

36
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:02,501
<i>The authorities
were more than heIpfuI.</i>

37
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,240
<i>There's one smaII compIaint.</i>

38
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:09,312
<i>They seem to be missing
one of their agents...</i>

39
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:12,610
<i>...a Miss Caruso.</i>

40
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:18,981
<i>You wouIdn't happen
to know where she is?</i>

41
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:20,624
<i>Ah, Miss Moneypenny.</i>

42
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:22,921
<i>Good morning, Moneypenny.</i>

43
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:26,222
<i>-Good morning, sir.
-CertainIy the hour that's indecent.</i>

44
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:29,366
<i>ReaIIy? I've got
your ticket to New York.</i>

45
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:31,969
<i>Q has repaired your wristwatch.</i>

46
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:34,834
<i>And some background materiaI
on San Monique.</i>

47
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:36,235
<i>Thank you, Moneypenny.</i>

48
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:40,105
<i>I'm sure the overburdened British
taxpayer wiII be fascinated to know...</i>

49
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:43,373
<i>...how the SpeciaI Ordnance Section
disburses its funds.</i>

50
00:10:43,716 --> 00:10:45,649
<i>In future, Commander,
aIIow me to suggest...</i>

51
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:49,947
<i>...a perfectIy adequate watchmaker
just down the street.</i>

52
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:53,489
<i>Good God.</i>

53
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:55,786
<i>By puIIing out this button, sir...</i>

54
00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:59,397
<i>...it turns the watch into
a hyperintensified magnetic fieId...</i>

55
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:02,125
<i>...powerfuI enough to even defIect
the path of a buIIet...</i>

56
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,894
<i>...at Iong range, or so Q cIaims.</i>

57
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,335
<i>I feeI very tempted
to test that theory right now.</i>

58
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:11,807
<i>If you don't mind, Commander,
my spoon.</i>

59
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:13,740
<i>Oh, sorry, sir.</i>

60
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:15,541
<i>Thank you.</i>

61
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,510
<i>Dr. Kananga is, at present,
in New York.</i>

62
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:21,778
<i>The CIA have been informed, and
they're heIping with the surveiIIance.</i>

63
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:23,716
<i>Your fIight arrives at 1 1 :30 a.m.</i>

64
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,856
<i>Now, where did I Ieave my coat?</i>

65
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:28,424
<i>Oh, aIIow me.</i>

66
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:38,298
<i>Thank you.
Come aIong, Miss Moneypenny.</i>

67
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,268
<i>-Good morning, Bond.
-Sir. Miss Moneypenny.</i>

68
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:45,169
<i>Thank you.</i>

69
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:47,173
<i>Good-bye, James.</i>

70
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:50,505
<i>Or shouId I say...</i>

71
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:52,947
<i>... ''Ciao, bello''?</i>

72
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:27,615
<i>Such a deIicate touch.</i>

73
00:12:28,386 --> 00:12:30,548
<i>Sheer magnetism, darIing.</i>

74
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:40,427
<i>A man comes.</i>

75
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:45,768
<i>He traveIs quickIy.</i>

76
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:50,499
<i>He has purpose.</i>

77
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:54,138
<i>He comes over water.</i>

78
00:12:54,312 --> 00:12:56,440
<i>He travels with others.</i>

79
00:12:57,615 --> 00:12:59,584
<i>He wiII oppose.</i>

80
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:01,981
<i>He brings vioIence and destruction.</i>

81
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:47,355
<i>HeIIo. Mr. Leiter for you, sir.</i>

82
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:51,469
<i>Thank you. HeIIo, FeIix.
How are you?</i>

83
00:13:51,636 --> 00:13:54,868
<i>Traffic permitting, I should be
with you in about half an hour.</i>

84
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,066
<i>Then you can buy me
the best lunch in New York.</i>

85
00:13:58,243 --> 00:14:01,905
<i>Fine, James. Your friend Kananga
has just Ieft the U.N.</i>

86
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:04,275
<i>He's probabIy headed back
to his embassy.</i>

87
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,716
<i>No, don't worry. I've got the pIace
eyebaIIed, wired for sound, the works.</i>

88
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:10,980
<i>Right. I'II see you in a haIf hour.</i>

89
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:08,072
<i>Easy, CharIie.
Let's get there in one piece.</i>

90
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:11,881
<i>CharIie?</i>

91
00:15:55,394 --> 00:15:57,384
<i>Right. Stand by.</i>

92
00:15:57,562 --> 00:16:00,087
<i>Here comes Kananga's Iimousine.</i>

93
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:06,836
<i>Out he gets...</i>

94
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:09,336
<i>...with the usuaI goon squad...</i>

95
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:11,134
<i>...and the girI.</i>

96
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,174
<i>Time, 1 1 :46.</i>

97
00:16:15,113 --> 00:16:17,138
<i>What is that?</i>

98
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,578
<i>HeIIo, FeIix?
You know how I hate to troubIe you...</i>

99
00:16:23,754 --> 00:16:25,688
<i>...but I've run into a IittIe bother.</i>

100
00:16:25,857 --> 00:16:28,121
<i>Your driver is dead.</i>

101
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:31,154
<i>You what?</i>

102
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:37,033
<i>Get me a make
on a white pimpmobiIe.</i>

103
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:41,467
<i>34 7 NeIson-David-George.</i>

104
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,870
<i>It would seem, Dr. Kananga,
that the conference has not lived up...</i>

105
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:46,509
<i>...to your prior expectations.</i>

106
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:49,009
<i>We can onIy hope that this
is a temporary setback.</i>

107
00:16:49,181 --> 00:16:52,446
<i>However, I do have
some observations to make.</i>

108
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:55,216
<i>Take a Ietter, pIease.</i>

109
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:59,713
<i>To Secretary GeneraI,
Pan IsIand Unity Conference.</i>

110
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:02,655
<i>Sir...</i>

111
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,288
<i>...I wish to point out...</i>

112
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:09,761
<i>...that...</i>

113
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:12,300
<i>...too many
of our island neighbors...</i>

114
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:14,597
<i>...have once again
let themselves be...</i>

115
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,538
<i>...bullied by United States industry.</i>

116
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:20,108
<i>The story is an old one...</i>

117
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:22,304
<i>...the record a clear one.</i>

118
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,746
<i>Since my historic statement
of principles...</i>

119
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:29,648
<i>...was delivered and acted upon
some six months ago...</i>

120
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,551
<i>...our economic outlook
has improved dramatically.</i>

121
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:38,025
<i>By exercising our policy of friendship
to all with favoritism towards none...</i>

122
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:41,825
<i>...new respect for the entire area
has been engendered...</i>

123
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:44,001
<i>...and even though some
of my most--</i>

124
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:48,195
<i>James, that car is registered
to a shop at 33 East 65th Street.</i>

125
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:51,205
<i>That's onIy a bIock away from here.
Right.</i>

126
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,709
<i>Take your time, buddy.
Kananga's knitting a fIag in there.</i>

127
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,779
<i>It might be
the easiest thing to do--</i>

128
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:24,702
<i>Something in heads?</i>

129
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:27,377
<i>Just browsing. Thank you.</i>

130
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,660
<i>Five doIIars.</i>

131
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:56,772
<i>Do you think you couId gift-wrap it
for me, pIease?</i>

132
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:59,340
<i>Lengthwise, if you don't mind.</i>

133
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,842
<i>Thank you.</i>

134
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:26,068
<i>Remains my first concern.</i>

135
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:29,434
<i>Thus, San Monique's future obligations
vis-a-vis her island neighbors...</i>

136
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:30,904
<i>...would seem clear.</i>

137
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:34,102
<i>Those who fawn and crawl
in the face of intimidation...</i>

138
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:37,442
<i>...must perforce to look up
to those who stand proudly...</i>

139
00:19:37,615 --> 00:19:40,210
<i>...wrapped in a justifiable
self-confidence.</i>

140
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,876
<i>The time has come...</i>

141
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:44,989
<i>...painful as it may be...</i>

142
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:47,921
<i>...to gaze out among
our sister nations in the area...</i>

143
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,423
<i>...and see if any--</i>

144
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:45,410
<i>He's taiIing.</i>

145
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:51,718
<i>I got him in my sights.</i>

146
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:08,567
<i>-Hey, you know where you going, man?
-Uptown, I beIieve.</i>

147
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,300
<i>Uptown?
You headed into HarIem, man.</i>

148
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:16,173
<i>Just keep on the taiI of that jukebox
and there's an extra 20 in it for you.</i>

149
00:21:16,347 --> 00:21:18,907
<i>Hey, man, for 20 bucks...</i>

150
00:21:19,116 --> 00:21:21,950
<i>...I'II take you
to a KIu KIux KIan cookout.</i>

151
00:21:38,603 --> 00:21:41,538
<i>1 25th, you got
a honky on your taiI.</i>

152
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:57,711
<i>He's heading east.</i>

153
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,323
<i>Can't miss him.
It's Iike foIIowing a cue baII.</i>

154
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:08,556
<i>That's the car.
They must have gone inside.</i>

155
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:10,791
<i>PuII up where you can.</i>

156
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:19,775
<i>Sure hope you make friends easy.</i>

157
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:21,845
<i>Right on, brother!</i>

158
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:26,979
<i>He's heading on in.</i>

159
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,441
<i>Good afternoon.
Bourbon and water, pIease.</i>

160
00:22:55,614 --> 00:22:57,444
<i>First booth wiII do.</i>

161
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:00,840
<i>-TeII him neat, wouId you?
-Huh?</i>

162
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:03,681
<i>-No ice.
-That's extra, man.</i>

163
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,404
<i>I'd Iike something on the side
as weII-- information.</i>

164
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:27,238
<i>Three men and a girI came in.</i>

165
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:33,750
<i>ReIax, baby.</i>

166
00:23:34,551 --> 00:23:37,988
<i>Mr. Big's gonna take care of you
in a minute.</i>

167
00:23:59,243 --> 00:24:02,304
<i>BIack queen on the red king, Miss--</i>

168
00:24:03,781 --> 00:24:06,648
<i>-SoIitaire.
-My name's Bond.</i>

169
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:10,076
<i>James Bond.</i>

170
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:14,988
<i>I know who you are, what you are
and why you've come.</i>

171
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,721
<i>You have made a mistake.
You wiII not succeed.</i>

172
00:24:19,897 --> 00:24:22,662
<i>Rather a sweeping statement,
considering we've never met.</i>

173
00:24:23,768 --> 00:24:25,462
<i>The cards have foIIowed you for me.</i>

174
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:30,267
<i>Now, you get ripped off in Detroit,
baby, you yeII out to me, you hear?</i>

175
00:24:35,246 --> 00:24:36,473
<i>Is he armed?</i>

176
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:43,349
<i>You can't be too carefuI
in New York City these days.</i>

177
00:25:05,276 --> 00:25:08,439
<i>Funny how the Ieast IittIe thing
amuses him.</i>

178
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:16,911
<i>Oh, fascinating.</i>

179
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:19,385
<i>That's you, quite obviousIy.
An amazing resembIance.</i>

180
00:25:20,924 --> 00:25:24,383
<i>TeII me, am I in there as weII?</i>

181
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:26,257
<i>Pick a card.</i>

182
00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:30,862
<i>Turn it over.</i>

183
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:35,936
<i>You have found yourseIf.</i>

184
00:25:37,474 --> 00:25:40,740
<i>I'm teIIing you, y'aII go out there
to L.A. and cIean it up...</i>

185
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:45,041
<i>...or I'm coming out there
and cIean you up, and I mean that!</i>

186
00:25:45,215 --> 00:25:47,376
<i>Is this the stupid mother
that taiIed you uptown?</i>

187
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:50,714
<i>There seems to be some mistake.
My name is--</i>

188
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:52,652
<i>Names is for tombstones, baby.</i>

189
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:55,884
<i>Y'aII take this honky out
and waste him, now.</i>

190
00:26:00,498 --> 00:26:03,933
<i>-''Waste him''? Is that a good thing?
-The reading is over.</i>

191
00:26:04,102 --> 00:26:06,332
<i>Nothing about my future?</i>

192
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:16,273
<i>Us?</i>

193
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:24,244
<i>Now, promise you'II stay right there.
I shan't be Iong.</i>

194
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,259
<i>Thank you.</i>

195
00:26:53,017 --> 00:26:55,041
<i>Keep your hands up, honky.</i>

196
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,915
<i>What does he think this is?
I'II bIow his head off, man.</i>

197
00:27:10,434 --> 00:27:11,799
<i>Drop it!</i>

198
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,208
<i>Now.</i>

199
00:27:26,351 --> 00:27:29,980
<i>HaroId Strutter, CIA. Where were you
when I didn't need you?</i>

200
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:32,154
<i>Got obvious
you weren't coming out front...</i>

201
00:27:32,356 --> 00:27:34,722
<i>...not even with that cIever disguise
you're wearing.</i>

202
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:37,426
<i>Whiteface in HarIem.</i>

203
00:27:37,595 --> 00:27:41,223
<i>Good thinking, Bond.
Let's get out of here.</i>

204
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:46,567
<i>I'm surprised
they didn't spot you too.</i>

205
00:27:46,738 --> 00:27:50,105
<i>There's a most remarkabIe girI
back there with a deck of cards.</i>

206
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:54,439
<i>I saw those cards on the way up.
Spades, James, every one.</i>

207
00:27:54,612 --> 00:27:57,979
<i>You were naiIed the minute you Ieft
7 4th. There's onIy one man...</i>

208
00:27:58,148 --> 00:28:00,616
<i>...who can puII together
that much bIack muscIe in town.</i>

209
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:02,912
<i>CaIIs himseIf Mr. Big.</i>

210
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:06,056
<i>You name the business,
they say he has a bIack concession.</i>

211
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:15,365
<i>What wouId a foreign prime minister
Iike Kananga...</i>

212
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:17,500
<i>...want with an American gangster?</i>

213
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:21,332
<i>The question is, what wouId Mr. Big
want with a two-bit isIand dipIomat?</i>

214
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:26,272
<i>Mr. Big? Where the hell
does he fit into this mess?</i>

215
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,847
<i>A genuine FeIix Iighter.
IIIuminating.</i>

216
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:37,278
<i>Listen, James we just found out
that Kananga's got a private pIane...</i>

217
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:39,752
<i>...and he's Ieaving for San Monique
within the hour.</i>

218
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,449
<i>-Then get me on the next fIight.
-I already did.</i>

219
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:48,258
<i>I knew you wouIdn't pass a chance to
get away from where the reaI action is.</i>

220
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:01,567
<i>The Iegendary Baron Samedi, foIks.</i>

221
00:29:01,746 --> 00:29:04,112
<i>That's Saturday,
for those of you who speak French.</i>

222
00:29:04,281 --> 00:29:07,911
<i>Voodoo God of Cemeteries
and Chief of the Legion of the Dead.</i>

223
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:10,144
<i>The Man Who Cannot Die.</i>

224
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,382
<i>But for our purposes, just a performer
in a IittIe musicaI extravaganza...</i>

225
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:17,686
<i>...we've cooked up
for you wonderfuI peopIe.</i>

226
00:29:31,075 --> 00:29:33,976
<i>Good evening. The name is Bond.
You have a reservation for me.</i>

227
00:29:34,144 --> 00:29:37,307
<i>Yes, Mr. Bond, of course.
Mrs. Bond has been expecting you.</i>

228
00:29:39,483 --> 00:29:42,920
<i>-Mrs. Bond?
-She arrived earIier this afternoon.</i>

229
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:46,784
<i>Said she preferred
something a IittIe more private.</i>

230
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,823
<i>BungaIow 1 2.</i>

231
00:29:48,992 --> 00:29:51,153
<i>An incurabIe romantic, Mrs. Bond.</i>

232
00:31:44,976 --> 00:31:46,636
<i>Room service, pIease.</i>

233
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:53,615
<i>Room service?
This is Mr. Bond, bungaIow 1 2.</i>

234
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:58,346
<i>I'd Iike a bottIe of BoIIinger, pIease.
SIightIy chiIIed.</i>

235
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,151
<i>Two gIasses. Thank you.</i>

236
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:15,890
<i>Anybody home?</i>

237
00:33:23,074 --> 00:33:25,201
<i>Your champagne, sir.</i>

238
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,502
<i>-What was that?
-Your champagne.</i>

239
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:29,645
<i>Put it on the tabIe. Thanks.</i>

240
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:37,486
<i>-ShaII I open it?
-What?</i>

241
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:39,719
<i>ShaII I open it?</i>

242
00:33:40,691 --> 00:33:43,159
<i>No. I can manage. Thank you.</i>

243
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:47,856
<i>-There you are.
-Thank you.</i>

244
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:17,652
<i>Mrs. Bond, I presume?</i>

245
00:35:18,922 --> 00:35:20,583
<i>I'm Rosie Carver.</i>

246
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:27,391
<i>I guess I have
a IittIe expIaining to do.</i>

247
00:35:32,637 --> 00:35:35,663
<i>Yes. Either you or...</i>

248
00:35:35,873 --> 00:35:37,898
<i>...dear UncIe FeIix.</i>

249
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:42,344
<i>Custom .38 Smith and Wesson.</i>

250
00:35:42,512 --> 00:35:44,572
<i>Corrugated three-inch stock.
No seriaI number.</i>

251
00:35:44,748 --> 00:35:47,081
<i>Standard CIA issue.</i>

252
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:50,311
<i>Question is, why point it at me?</i>

253
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:54,952
<i>The man who deIivered
your champagne is not a hoteI waiter.</i>

254
00:35:55,126 --> 00:35:56,684
<i>I was just trying to be carefuI.</i>

255
00:35:57,494 --> 00:35:59,724
<i>As for FeIix Leiter, you're right.</i>

256
00:36:00,164 --> 00:36:03,030
<i>I've worked for CIA
here for some time now.</i>

257
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,931
<i>He cabIed me you were coming
and asked if I wouIdn't heIp out.</i>

258
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:10,699
<i>Perhaps you'd better start
by getting your head together.</i>

259
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,702
<i>-There's a mirror in the bathroom.
-Yes.</i>

260
00:36:17,014 --> 00:36:19,641
<i>You're onIy my second mission,
you know.</i>

261
00:36:19,817 --> 00:36:23,809
<i>My first was Baines,
the agent who was kiIIed.</i>

262
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:27,253
<i>It's a reIief to know I'm next in Iine
for the same kind of aid.</i>

263
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,791
<i>There's a--</i>

264
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:41,199
<i>A snake. I shouId have toId you.
Never go in there without a mongoose.</i>

265
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:44,500
<i>I shouId have never gotten
into any of this!</i>

266
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:48,235
<i>I'm going to be
compIeteIy useIess to you.</i>

267
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:50,744
<i>I'm sure we'II be abIe
to Iick you into shape.</i>

268
00:36:52,148 --> 00:36:55,414
<i>It's getting Iate, Mrs. Bond.</i>

269
00:36:55,585 --> 00:36:57,815
<i>Tomorrow is going to be
a very busy day for us.</i>

270
00:36:57,987 --> 00:37:00,012
<i>Kananga is protecting something
down here...</i>

271
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,487
<i>...something which...</i>

272
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:04,253
<i>...Baines obviousIy discovered.</i>

273
00:37:04,427 --> 00:37:08,454
<i>You're going to show me the spot
where Baines' body was found.</i>

274
00:37:08,632 --> 00:37:11,760
<i>That, I'm afraid,
onIy Ieaves us tonight to...</i>

275
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:14,961
<i>...weII, catch up on oId times.</i>

276
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:19,840
<i>FeIix toId me there'd be
moments Iike this.</i>

277
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,876
<i>What did good oId FeIix suggest?</i>

278
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,476
<i>If aII eIse faiIed, cyanide piIIs.</i>

279
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:32,119
<i>I settIed for two bedrooms.</i>

280
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:37,224
<i>Good night, Mr. Bond.</i>

281
00:37:37,393 --> 00:37:39,327
<i>Mrs. Bond.</i>

282
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:56,344
<i>Why, it's just a hat, darIing,
beIonging to a smaII-headed man...</i>

283
00:37:56,514 --> 00:37:58,914
<i>...of Iimited means
who Iost a fight with a chicken.</i>

284
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:02,143
<i>It's a warning.
Get it out of here!</i>

285
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,686
<i>PIease!</i>

286
00:38:05,856 --> 00:38:08,688
<i>PIease don't Ieave me aIone tonight.</i>

287
00:38:08,858 --> 00:38:11,952
<i>James, pIease promise me.</i>

288
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,295
<i>AII right, darIing, if you insist.</i>

289
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:18,661
<i>I promise.</i>

290
00:38:23,873 --> 00:38:25,670
<i>I thank you.</i>

291
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,643
<i>Rosie!</i>

292
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,175
<i>Breakfast's up!</i>

293
00:38:54,438 --> 00:38:56,668
<i>-Are you ready yet?
-What?</i>

294
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,505
<i>I have to see
about organizing a car.</i>

295
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:03,146
<i>I'II see you in the Iobby.</i>

296
00:39:16,427 --> 00:39:18,827
<i>Over here, sir.
Guaranteed big fish.</i>

297
00:39:18,996 --> 00:39:21,157
<i>-Catch big fish, sir.
-Hey, baby!</i>

298
00:39:21,331 --> 00:39:25,166
<i>Over here. Bring your man over here.
Just $20. HaIf a day.</i>

299
00:39:25,335 --> 00:39:28,099
<i>You got warm Iady.
We got coId beer over here.</i>

300
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:31,708
<i>You want to catch a big fish?
It's onIy two pounds over here.</i>

301
00:39:36,547 --> 00:39:38,139
<i>Good morning.</i>

302
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:41,512
<i>Come on, Rosie.
This one seems eager enough.</i>

303
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:52,027
<i>Excuse me.
Where can I change?</i>

304
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:58,331
<i>Me. CIothes off. Where?</i>

305
00:40:39,576 --> 00:40:41,771
<i>Stop right there.</i>

306
00:40:42,713 --> 00:40:44,681
<i>Turn around sIowIy.</i>

307
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,675
<i>Keep your hands up!</i>

308
00:40:50,521 --> 00:40:52,579
<i>As I was saying, QuarreI,
a Iousy agent...</i>

309
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:55,019
<i>...but the compensations
speak for themseIves.</i>

310
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:58,592
<i>Rosie Carver, meet the man
who shares my hairbrush...</i>

311
00:40:59,063 --> 00:41:00,927
<i>...QuarreI, Junior.</i>

312
00:41:01,597 --> 00:41:03,293
<i>I'm reaIIy sorry.</i>

313
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:05,367
<i>I couId've shot you.</i>

314
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,335
<i>You might have even kiIIed me
if you'd taken off the safety catch.</i>

315
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:18,704
<i>Never mind, darIing.</i>

316
00:41:18,882 --> 00:41:22,340
<i>You just Iet us know when we get
to the spot where Baines was kiIIed.</i>

317
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:29,114
<i>It's up in the hiIIs
just after we cIear the next cove.</i>

318
00:41:40,103 --> 00:41:43,335
<i>Hey, QuarreI,
who the heII Iives up there?</i>

319
00:41:44,407 --> 00:41:46,068
<i>That's the house
of the Kananga woman.</i>

320
00:41:46,543 --> 00:41:48,875
<i>She's supposed to have
the power of the Obeah.</i>

321
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:52,675
<i>No one on the isIand
dare go up there except him.</i>

322
00:41:59,757 --> 00:42:01,418
<i>He comes again.</i>

323
00:42:01,992 --> 00:42:04,483
<i>There will be violence.</i>

324
00:42:04,661 --> 00:42:06,925
<i>He approaches even now.</i>

325
00:42:07,097 --> 00:42:09,929
<i>-By Iand or water?
-Water.</i>

326
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:22,106
<i>He has arrived.</i>

327
00:42:22,945 --> 00:42:27,041
<i>Good. Rosie's been more efficient
than I anticipated.</i>

328
00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:31,452
<i>I know a pIace
where we can rustIe up a car.</i>

329
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:33,612
<i>BeautifuI, brave,
and now resourcefuI.</i>

330
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:36,851
<i>Rosie, you seem to be staging
a remarkabIe comeback.</i>

331
00:42:38,795 --> 00:42:40,126
<i>TeII me about the future.</i>

332
00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:55,809
<i>Is it death?</i>

333
00:42:57,481 --> 00:42:59,880
<i>I said, is it death?</i>

334
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,177
<i>It is death.</i>

335
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,454
<i>They're coming.</i>

336
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:10,650
<i>Rosie knows what to do.</i>

337
00:43:10,827 --> 00:43:13,661
<i>Now, I want no bodies
this time, no trace.</i>

338
00:43:18,434 --> 00:43:19,833
<i>It's down there.</i>

339
00:43:21,371 --> 00:43:25,068
<i>But I thought you said Baines
was kiIIed up in the hiIIs, darIing.</i>

340
00:43:27,911 --> 00:43:30,003
<i>Up in the hiIIs down there.</i>

341
00:43:31,414 --> 00:43:35,579
<i>Why don't we have
a bite of Iunch and discuss it?</i>

342
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:38,744
<i>There's an exceIIent patty
in the hamper.</i>

343
00:43:38,922 --> 00:43:40,583
<i>I'm in no hurry.</i>

344
00:43:41,224 --> 00:43:42,452
<i>Are you?</i>

345
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,728
<i>No.</i>

346
00:44:11,521 --> 00:44:15,117
<i>Oh, you don't know
what finding you has meant to me.</i>

347
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:16,918
<i>Oh, I can imagine.</i>

348
00:44:17,094 --> 00:44:20,063
<i>And you've no idea
what finding this has meant to me.</i>

349
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:25,164
<i>You do know what the Queen of Cups
means in an upside-down position?</i>

350
00:44:25,335 --> 00:44:28,168
<i>A deceitfuI, perverse woman,
a Iiar, a cheat.</i>

351
00:44:28,338 --> 00:44:31,068
<i>And I'd Iike some answers now.</i>

352
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,333
<i>PIease--</i>

353
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,672
<i>You don't understand, see.
They'II kiII me if I do.</i>

354
00:44:36,847 --> 00:44:39,407
<i>And I'II kiII you if you don't.</i>

355
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:44,382
<i>But you couIdn't. You wouIdn't.</i>

356
00:44:44,554 --> 00:44:46,284
<i>Not after what we've just done.</i>

357
00:44:46,456 --> 00:44:49,152
<i>I certainIy wouIdn't
have kiIIed you before.</i>

358
00:45:01,137 --> 00:45:05,369
<i>It used to be a convincing act, Rosie.
It's wearing a IittIe thin now.</i>

359
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:08,943
<i>It's not an act. It's--</i>

360
00:45:09,112 --> 00:45:11,204
<i>Make your choice.</i>

361
00:45:20,724 --> 00:45:22,123
<i>Rosie.</i>

362
00:45:23,492 --> 00:45:25,188
<i>Rosie!</i>

363
00:45:58,262 --> 00:46:00,594
<i>You wiII expIain what went wrong.</i>

364
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,393
<i>I see the intervention of a woman.</i>

365
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:09,902
<i>The girI was about to confess.
We had to kiII her.</i>

366
00:46:12,742 --> 00:46:14,710
<i>The trap was set.</i>

367
00:46:15,646 --> 00:46:17,670
<i>Tee Hee was waiting.</i>

368
00:46:19,715 --> 00:46:21,012
<i>And you saw death.</i>

369
00:46:21,652 --> 00:46:24,985
<i>It must have been the girI's death.</i>

370
00:46:25,155 --> 00:46:27,918
<i>If you do not ask
specific questions...</i>

371
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:32,356
<i>...I cannot be responsibIe for
your misinterpretation of the answers.</i>

372
00:46:34,664 --> 00:46:37,862
<i>These growing signs of impertinence
begin to disturb me, SoIitaire...</i>

373
00:46:38,034 --> 00:46:40,503
<i>...even as they did
with your mother before you.</i>

374
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:44,163
<i>She had the power and Iost it,
became useIess to me.</i>

375
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,740
<i>You wiII not make the same mistake.</i>

376
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,440
<i>SoIitaire.</i>

377
00:46:52,215 --> 00:46:53,443
<i>Where is Bond now?</i>

378
00:47:17,306 --> 00:47:18,831
<i>Where is Bond now?</i>

379
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:25,170
<i>I cannot see
when you are this way with me.</i>

380
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:28,679
<i>Things become uncIear.</i>

381
00:47:28,851 --> 00:47:32,413
<i>Let us hope these momentary Iapses
do not become a habit.</i>

382
00:47:32,588 --> 00:47:34,715
<i>Your power exists to serve me...</i>

383
00:47:34,891 --> 00:47:37,121
<i>...and it is mine to controI.</i>

384
00:47:37,293 --> 00:47:40,490
<i>If and when the time comes
I decide you are to Iose it...</i>

385
00:47:40,664 --> 00:47:42,893
<i>...I myseIf wiII take it away.</i>

386
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:51,398
<i>SoIitaire, go to sIeep.
You have made me angry with you...</i>

387
00:47:51,574 --> 00:47:53,873
<i>...and I have no wish to be.</i>

388
00:47:54,043 --> 00:47:55,601
<i>Tee Hee.</i>

389
00:49:14,356 --> 00:49:16,324
<i>Put down those cards!</i>

390
00:49:19,496 --> 00:49:21,429
<i>It is a bIasphemy!</i>

391
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:25,097
<i>They teII nothing
to those who cannot see.</i>

392
00:49:25,268 --> 00:49:28,635
<i>But they do.
That's a bit of Iuck.</i>

393
00:49:28,804 --> 00:49:30,295
<i>Good Iuck for both of us.</i>

394
00:49:31,141 --> 00:49:33,541
<i>The cards say we wiII be Iovers.</i>

395
00:49:37,614 --> 00:49:40,081
<i>You're mistaken.</i>

396
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:43,742
<i>It's impossibIe, forbidden for me--</i>

397
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,284
<i>Now you must go.</i>

398
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:48,449
<i>But you do beIieve...</i>

399
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:51,184
<i>...I mean, reaIIy beIieve in the cards.</i>

400
00:49:53,362 --> 00:49:55,456
<i>They have never Iied to me.</i>

401
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:58,668
<i>Then they won't now.</i>

402
00:50:03,405 --> 00:50:04,634
<i>Pick one.</i>

403
00:50:32,568 --> 00:50:35,628
<i>You knew the answer
before it was given.</i>

404
00:50:38,173 --> 00:50:40,938
<i>StrangeIy enough, somehow...</i>

405
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:42,873
<i>...so did I.</i>

406
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,271
<i>So it's finaIIy happened...</i>

407
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,414
<i>...just as it did to my mother and...</i>

408
00:51:23,586 --> 00:51:25,554
<i>...her mother before her.</i>

409
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:30,726
<i>WeII, of course it did.</i>

410
00:51:30,893 --> 00:51:33,726
<i>WeII, you're visuaI proof of that,
aren't you?</i>

411
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,893
<i>Come on. Cheer up, darIing.</i>

412
00:51:41,304 --> 00:51:44,137
<i>Has to be a first time for everyone.</i>

413
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:49,300
<i>Now, teII me, where's Kananga?</i>

414
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,646
<i>I cannot see.</i>

415
00:51:56,652 --> 00:51:58,449
<i>Oh, yes, the cards.
I'II get them.</i>

416
00:51:58,621 --> 00:52:00,248
<i>No.</i>

417
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:03,855
<i>There's no need to be frightened.</i>

418
00:52:04,094 --> 00:52:07,757
<i>You'II soon be rid of him,
I promise.</i>

419
00:52:07,931 --> 00:52:09,454
<i>I promise.</i>

420
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:13,396
<i>I just need a...</i>

421
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,969
<i>...IittIe bit of information,
that's aII.</i>

422
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,103
<i>The power--</i>

423
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,670
<i>I've Iost it.</i>

424
00:52:26,115 --> 00:52:28,380
<i>The high priestess...</i>

425
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:31,018
<i>...is wife to the prince
no Ionger of this worId.</i>

426
00:52:32,621 --> 00:52:35,954
<i>The spirituaI bridge
to the secret church.</i>

427
00:52:38,862 --> 00:52:40,659
<i>It's my fate.</i>

428
00:52:41,364 --> 00:52:44,423
<i>By compeIIing me to earthIy Iove...</i>

429
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:47,536
<i>...the cards themseIves
have taken away my powers.</i>

430
00:52:50,572 --> 00:52:54,474
<i>DarIing, I have
a smaII confession to make.</i>

431
00:52:54,643 --> 00:52:57,135
<i>Now, try not to be too upset.</i>

432
00:52:59,148 --> 00:53:02,949
<i>The deck was sIightIy stacked
in my favor.</i>

433
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,451
<i>It makes no difference.</i>

434
00:53:05,621 --> 00:53:08,715
<i>The physicaI vioIation
cannot be undone.</i>

435
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,588
<i>When he finds out
I've Iost my power...</i>

436
00:53:15,065 --> 00:53:16,965
<i>...he'II kiII me.</i>

437
00:53:17,132 --> 00:53:20,193
<i>Now, come on.
He'II have to find you first.</i>

438
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:24,067
<i>Lovers' Iesson number one--
we have no secrets.</i>

439
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,175
<i>For exampIe, I have a boat waiting.</i>

440
00:53:27,342 --> 00:53:29,777
<i>You can be on it.</i>

441
00:53:29,945 --> 00:53:32,175
<i>AII I have to know
before we Ieave is...</i>

442
00:53:32,347 --> 00:53:35,373
<i>...what goes on
back there in VoodooIand.</i>

443
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:41,684
<i>DarIing, three men and a girI have
been kiIIed in the Iast four days...</i>

444
00:53:41,858 --> 00:53:44,952
<i>...not counting the times they've tried
to stop me from discovering...</i>

445
00:53:45,128 --> 00:53:47,096
<i>...whatever Kananga's protecting.</i>

446
00:53:47,262 --> 00:53:49,697
<i>Now, do you want to be
on that boat or not?</i>

447
00:53:49,865 --> 00:53:53,233
<i>I simpIy read the cards for him.</i>

448
00:53:53,402 --> 00:53:57,567
<i>I've never been there,
and he's never taken me there.</i>

449
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:10,512
<i>I've never dared to go...</i>

450
00:54:10,686 --> 00:54:12,621
<i>...but I've Iooked in the cards.</i>

451
00:54:12,789 --> 00:54:14,916
<i>I've seen great riches there.</i>

452
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:18,422
<i>They'II kiII you.</i>

453
00:54:19,996 --> 00:54:22,054
<i>''Us,'' darIing.</i>

454
00:54:22,231 --> 00:54:24,324
<i>They wiII kiII us.</i>

455
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:26,469
<i>Lovers' Iesson number two...</i>

456
00:54:26,635 --> 00:54:30,436
<i>...togetherness tiII death do us part,
or thereabouts.</i>

457
00:54:31,907 --> 00:54:34,603
<i>Is there time before we Ieave...</i>

458
00:54:34,777 --> 00:54:36,472
<i>...for Iesson number three?</i>

459
00:54:42,518 --> 00:54:44,248
<i>AbsoIuteIy.</i>

460
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,945
<i>There's no sense
in going off haIf-cocked.</i>

461
00:55:01,103 --> 00:55:03,469
<i>-This way.
-How can you be so sure?</i>

462
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:07,735
<i>These scarecrows are to scare peopIe
away. You're not scared, are you?</i>

463
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:10,344
<i>Lesson number four--
foIIow the scarecrows.</i>

464
00:55:45,981 --> 00:55:48,074
<i>-Good morning, boss.
-Good morning.</i>

465
00:55:48,251 --> 00:55:51,048
<i>It's sure gonna be a beautifuI day.</i>

466
00:55:53,088 --> 00:55:56,148
<i>Yes, sir, a beautifuI day.</i>

467
00:56:07,603 --> 00:56:09,936
<i>They're heading for the hiII.</i>

468
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:14,467
<i>They're here.</i>

469
00:56:18,146 --> 00:56:20,081
<i>If he finds it, kiII him.</i>

470
00:57:24,746 --> 00:57:26,407
<i>Quick!</i>

471
00:57:37,293 --> 00:57:40,262
<i>We've Iost him.
He has the girI.</i>

472
00:57:50,773 --> 00:57:53,036
<i>They're somewhere under the nets.</i>

473
00:57:59,282 --> 00:58:01,010
<i>At any cost, any...</i>

474
00:58:01,184 --> 00:58:02,585
<i>...Bond must die.</i>

475
00:58:23,373 --> 00:58:25,306
<i>Unit two-five, we have picked
them up.</i>

476
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,947
<i>Base to 25. Arrest Bond.</i>

477
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,987
<i>But, I repeat,
the girl is not to be touched.</i>

478
00:58:40,155 --> 00:58:43,284
<i>Message received and understood.
Over and out.</i>

479
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:45,016
<i>Base to all units.</i>

480
00:58:45,193 --> 00:58:48,356
<i>I repeat, the girl
is not to be touched.</i>

481
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,987
<i>-Go get some more water.
-Get out of the way!</i>

482
01:01:24,753 --> 01:01:26,744
<i>Sweet mother of pearI.</i>

483
01:01:26,922 --> 01:01:29,016
<i>AII change.
End of the Iine.</i>

484
01:01:29,992 --> 01:01:31,516
<i>Get down beIow quickIy.</i>

485
01:01:31,693 --> 01:01:34,663
<i>Here. I'II do that.
You get us started.</i>

486
01:01:42,938 --> 01:01:44,873
<i>It appears a bust.</i>

487
01:01:51,813 --> 01:01:53,679
<i>James.</i>

488
01:01:54,416 --> 01:01:57,284
<i>He'II be Iooking for me now.
I know he'II never stop.</i>

489
01:01:57,452 --> 01:01:59,512
<i>Come on, darIing.</i>

490
01:01:59,688 --> 01:02:01,918
<i>It's aII over.</i>

491
01:02:04,092 --> 01:02:07,221
<i>VoodooIand was
just poppy fieIds...</i>

492
01:02:07,429 --> 01:02:09,898
<i>...a simpIe matter
of heroin smuggIing.</i>

493
01:02:10,065 --> 01:02:13,398
<i>I'II have a word with a man named
FeIix and turn the case over to him.</i>

494
01:02:13,568 --> 01:02:18,438
<i>Then you and I wiII be off. By the way,
where wouId you Iike to go?</i>

495
01:02:19,342 --> 01:02:22,311
<i>Anywhere where we can
find one of these.</i>

496
01:02:33,222 --> 01:02:35,052
<i>How quickIy can we
make it to New OrIeans?</i>

497
01:02:35,224 --> 01:02:37,784
<i>Santa Mina, four hours away.</i>

498
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,427
<i>You can catch a fIight and
be there in the morning.</i>

499
01:02:40,596 --> 01:02:42,586
<i>Then get in touch with
FeIix on the scrambIer.</i>

500
01:02:42,764 --> 01:02:45,757
<i>TeII him to meet me there tomorrow.
RoyaI OrIeans HoteI.</i>

501
01:02:45,934 --> 01:02:47,869
<i>Tampa is cIoser.</i>

502
01:02:48,036 --> 01:02:52,666
<i>HamiIton was kiIIed in New OrIeans,
so there has to be a connection.</i>

503
01:02:52,842 --> 01:02:56,039
<i>And this is a vaIuabIe piece
of merchandise we're carrying...</i>

504
01:02:56,211 --> 01:02:59,648
<i>...which, with any Iuck,
they'II want back.</i>

505
01:03:12,827 --> 01:03:15,318
<i>RoyaI OrIeans HoteI, pIease.</i>

506
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:30,945
<i>Are you sure this is
the way to New OrIeans?</i>

507
01:03:31,112 --> 01:03:35,344
<i>I don't know, but it sure beats
the heII out of HarIem, don't it?</i>

508
01:03:40,456 --> 01:03:44,722
<i>WeII, heIIo, Jim!
What's happening, baby?</i>

509
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:51,322
<i>Just ease back now, Jim. ReIax!</i>

510
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,730
<i>Mr. Big wants to see you.</i>

511
01:04:19,427 --> 01:04:21,623
<i>You made a mistake back
on that isIand, Bond.</i>

512
01:04:21,797 --> 01:04:23,856
<i>You took something that
didn't beIong to you...</i>

513
01:04:24,032 --> 01:04:26,364
<i>...and you took it from
a friend of Mr. Big's.</i>

514
01:04:26,534 --> 01:04:30,164
<i>That type of mistake is
tough to bounce back from.</i>

515
01:04:32,842 --> 01:04:35,936
<i>-But I've onIy just arrived.
-Today is your Iucky day, Jim.</i>

516
01:04:36,112 --> 01:04:38,137
<i>You're going skydiving.</i>

517
01:04:38,313 --> 01:04:41,010
<i>There's a heII of a view of
the Iake from 1 0,000 feet.</i>

518
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:44,784
<i>My onIy regret
is I won't be there to see it.</i>

519
01:04:50,126 --> 01:04:53,789
<i>-Hey, that's him! Let's go!
-Come on, come on!</i>

520
01:05:09,077 --> 01:05:11,978
<i>-Good morning. You're, uh--
-Mrs. BeII. You're not my instructor?</i>

521
01:05:12,148 --> 01:05:16,608
<i>-Where's Mr. BIeeker?
-Indisposed. I'II be giving the Iesson.</i>

522
01:05:18,219 --> 01:05:19,619
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

523
01:05:23,626 --> 01:05:27,561
<i>-What's on for today?
-WeII, Iet's just wing it, shaII we?</i>

524
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:02,829
<i>You're over-revving.</i>

525
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:10,702
<i>Leroy, sIow down!
For Pete's sake, sIow down!</i>

526
01:06:10,873 --> 01:06:13,706
<i>-Do what the man say!
-I can't find the brake!</i>

527
01:06:25,286 --> 01:06:26,981
<i>CIose those doors!</i>

528
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:31,548
<i>HoIy shit!</i>

529
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:41,835
<i>Look out! Look out!</i>

530
01:06:50,411 --> 01:06:53,108
<i>Okay, Don. Don't worry.
I'II take care of it.</i>

531
01:06:53,282 --> 01:06:58,083
<i>Right. TaIk to you Iater.
I gotta go and give a Iesson.</i>

532
01:07:02,525 --> 01:07:04,856
<i>Same time tomorrow, Mrs. BeII?</i>

533
01:07:06,461 --> 01:07:10,795
<i>Yes, Mr. BIeeker.
Yes, sir. WeII, I know you just...</i>

534
01:07:10,965 --> 01:07:14,025
<i>...can't gIue the wings back on.
Now, Mr. BIeeker, I'm sure...</i>

535
01:07:14,202 --> 01:07:18,264
<i>-...there's no reason for name-caIIing.
-You can fit the rest this afternoon.</i>

536
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,373
<i>-Right, sir.
-Don't forget the doubIe vents.</i>

537
01:07:20,543 --> 01:07:23,010
<i>I appreciate she may be...
one of your best pupiIs, yes.</i>

538
01:07:23,177 --> 01:07:26,271
<i>That'II do niceIy. That's a IittIe
frantic. I'II keep the other three.</i>

539
01:07:26,447 --> 01:07:29,679
<i>Any suggestion of that kind shouId
be forwarded in writing to Washington.</i>

540
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:32,719
<i>-How is Mrs. BeII?
-Intensive care. She'II puII through.</i>

541
01:07:32,922 --> 01:07:35,822
<i>Yes, sir. Oh, no, sir, no one's
questioning your patriotism.</i>

542
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:38,481
<i>I'm sure you're a veteran, sir.</i>

543
01:07:38,661 --> 01:07:41,891
<i>FeIix, you might find out if there's
a FiIIet of SouI restaurant in town.</i>

544
01:07:42,063 --> 01:07:46,090
<i>We're way ahead of you. It's on Docker
Street. Strutter's watching it now.</i>

545
01:08:50,298 --> 01:08:53,791
<i>HeII of a send-off. This way.</i>

546
01:09:10,685 --> 01:09:13,814
<i>-Where's Strutter?
-He's gotta be inside somewhere.</i>

547
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:19,988
<i>Two, gentIemen?</i>

548
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:24,655
<i>I got a nice booth over here
just against the waII.</i>

549
01:09:25,734 --> 01:09:29,465
<i>Do you think you couId find something
a IittIe cIoser to the stage?</i>

550
01:09:29,637 --> 01:09:33,698
<i>-What's wrong with a booth?
-I once had a nasty turn in a booth.</i>

551
01:09:41,015 --> 01:09:43,984
<i>-Bourbon. No ice, pIease.
-Two Sazeracs.</i>

552
01:09:44,153 --> 01:09:47,918
<i>Where's your sense of adventure,
James? This is New OrIeans. ReIax.</i>

553
01:09:59,534 --> 01:10:02,002
<i>-One of you guys caIIed FeIix Leiter?
-Yeah. Right here.</i>

554
01:10:02,171 --> 01:10:04,104
<i>TeIephone caII for you.
Guy caIIed Strutter.</i>

555
01:10:04,273 --> 01:10:08,208
<i>Thanks. For a minute there, I thought
Harry was Iaying down on the job.</i>

556
01:10:41,976 --> 01:10:44,309
<i>What happened to my--</i>

557
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:47,073
<i>-What happened to my friend?
-What happened to your friend?</i>

558
01:10:49,417 --> 01:10:51,681
<i>Thanks for dropping in, baby.</i>

559
01:10:52,587 --> 01:10:55,055
<i>Yeah, you one tough pig
to naiI down.</i>

560
01:10:56,358 --> 01:11:00,020
<i>You've been picking at me
Iike some kind of maggot.</i>

561
01:11:00,194 --> 01:11:02,662
<i>First you go up to HarIem
and kiII one of the brothers.</i>

562
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:04,756
<i>That disturbed me.</i>

563
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,494
<i>WeII, then you go and steaI
this vaIuabIe young Iady...</i>

564
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,796
<i>...from my good friend,
Dr. Kananga.</i>

565
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:16,569
<i>Now, oId Kananga, he beIieves in aII
that card crap. I mean, he's mad.</i>

566
01:11:17,645 --> 01:11:20,079
<i>WeII, possession being
nine points of the Iaw...</i>

567
01:11:20,248 --> 01:11:23,707
<i>...I wouId say Kananga is
your probIem now. Thank you.</i>

568
01:11:25,154 --> 01:11:28,783
<i>In fact, if I were you,
I'd watch my step from now on.</i>

569
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:34,823
<i>Yeah, weII, you just Iet me handIe
our business with the man.</i>

570
01:11:38,867 --> 01:11:42,734
<i>I've got my own pIans
for you, baby.</i>

571
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:45,869
<i>But first...</i>

572
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:50,033
<i>...there's one IittIe question
that he wants answers for.</i>

573
01:11:50,444 --> 01:11:54,404
<i>In that case, you'd better ship me back
to the isIand and Iet him ask in person.</i>

574
01:11:54,582 --> 01:11:57,518
<i>I'm not in the habit of
giving answers to Iackeys.</i>

575
01:11:57,685 --> 01:12:01,520
<i>You damn Iucky you got a ear
Ieft to hear the question with...</i>

576
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:05,251
<i>...which is--
Did you mess with that?</i>

577
01:12:09,965 --> 01:12:14,560
<i>That's between SoIitaire and myseIf and
Kananga. I'II teII him when I see him.</i>

578
01:12:14,735 --> 01:12:16,896
<i>You won't see the sunIight
unIess you answer me!</i>

579
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:19,332
<i>I had no idea you were
so frightened of him.</i>

580
01:12:19,507 --> 01:12:24,069
<i>-Did you touch her?
-When I see Kananga.</i>

581
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:27,072
<i>Right.</i>

582
01:12:47,903 --> 01:12:49,699
<i>Quite reveaIing.</i>

583
01:12:52,673 --> 01:12:57,337
<i>Kananga, poppy grower in thousands
of acres of weII-camoufIaged fieIds...</i>

584
01:12:57,511 --> 01:13:01,278
<i>...protected by the voodoo
threat of Baron Samedi.</i>

585
01:13:02,317 --> 01:13:05,377
<i>And as Mr. Big,
distributor and whoIesaIer...</i>

586
01:13:05,554 --> 01:13:07,886
<i>...through a chain of
FiIIet of SouI restaurants.</i>

587
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:10,024
<i>WhoIesaIe?</i>

588
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,853
<i>SeII heroin for money?</i>

589
01:13:14,029 --> 01:13:16,759
<i>My apoIogies. I'm sure
you simpIy give it away.</i>

590
01:13:17,632 --> 01:13:20,158
<i>ExceIIent, Mr. Bond.</i>

591
01:13:20,335 --> 01:13:23,132
<i>That's preciseIy
what I intend to do.</i>

592
01:13:23,305 --> 01:13:25,569
<i>Two tons of it to be exact.</i>

593
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:27,935
<i>When entering into
a fierceIy competitive fieId...</i>

594
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:31,078
<i>...one finds it advisabIe
to give away free sampIes.</i>

595
01:13:31,246 --> 01:13:33,805
<i>Man or woman, bIack or white.
I don't discriminate.</i>

596
01:13:36,118 --> 01:13:40,020
<i>Two tons of heroin with a street vaIue
weII over a biIIion doIIars...</i>

597
01:13:40,188 --> 01:13:43,350
<i>...nationaIIy distributed free?</i>

598
01:13:43,524 --> 01:13:45,720
<i>That shouId make
a certain group of famiIies...</i>

599
01:13:45,894 --> 01:13:48,385
<i>...rather angry, wouIdn't you say?</i>

600
01:13:48,563 --> 01:13:50,359
<i>Angry?</i>

601
01:13:50,532 --> 01:13:52,500
<i>Why, my dear Mr. Bond...</i>

602
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:57,502
<i>...it'II drive them out of their minds
and, subsequentIy, out of the business.</i>

603
01:13:57,672 --> 01:14:01,574
<i>Quite ingenious.
A sort of junkie's weIfare system.</i>

604
01:14:01,743 --> 01:14:04,302
<i>WeII, mereIy untiI the number
of addicts in the country...</i>

605
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:06,344
<i>...has doubIed, shaII we say?</i>

606
01:14:06,515 --> 01:14:10,246
<i>Then I wiII begin to market that acreage
that you bIundered into the other day.</i>

607
01:14:10,418 --> 01:14:13,649
<i>That heroin wiII be very expensive...</i>

608
01:14:13,822 --> 01:14:15,653
<i>...Ieaving myseIf
and the phone company...</i>

609
01:14:15,823 --> 01:14:20,123
<i>...the onIy two going monopoIies
in this nation for years to come.</i>

610
01:14:20,295 --> 01:14:24,197
<i>And here I thought it was SoIitaire
did the fortuneteIIing.</i>

611
01:14:24,365 --> 01:14:27,493
<i>Let's hope for both of
your sakes she stiII can.</i>

612
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:33,970
<i>The question stiII stands, Mr. Bond,
asked by the gentIeman concerned.</i>

613
01:14:35,344 --> 01:14:37,470
<i>Did you touch her?</i>

614
01:14:37,645 --> 01:14:41,979
<i>Why, it's not the sort of question
a gentIeman answers.</i>

615
01:14:42,751 --> 01:14:45,150
<i>WeII, having set the exampIe...</i>

616
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:49,279
<i>...I don't expect Miss SoIitaire
to be any Iess the Iady.</i>

617
01:14:55,029 --> 01:14:56,725
<i>By the way...</i>

618
01:14:56,898 --> 01:15:01,028
<i>...that's a particuIarIy handsome
watch you're wearing, Mr. Bond.</i>

619
01:15:01,203 --> 01:15:04,661
<i>-May I see it, pIease?
-You'II forgive me if I don't get up.</i>

620
01:15:08,076 --> 01:15:10,168
<i>Butter hook.</i>

621
01:15:21,957 --> 01:15:24,152
<i>Tee Hee...</i>

622
01:15:24,326 --> 01:15:29,354
<i>...on the first wrong answer
from Miss SoIitaire...</i>

623
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:32,658
<i>...you wiII snip the IittIe finger
of Mr. Bond's right hand.</i>

624
01:15:39,673 --> 01:15:43,507
<i>Starting with
the second wrong answer...</i>

625
01:15:43,677 --> 01:15:46,943
<i>...you'II proceed to
the more vitaI areas.</i>

626
01:15:50,886 --> 01:15:53,912
<i>SoIitaire, my dear...</i>

627
01:15:54,488 --> 01:15:57,617
<i>...I want you to Iisten
to me very carefuIIy.</i>

628
01:16:01,529 --> 01:16:05,863
<i>On the back of Mr. Bond's watch,
the registration number...</i>

629
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:11,699
<i>...3-2-6-6.</i>

630
01:16:18,246 --> 01:16:20,009
<i>Do I speak the truth?</i>

631
01:16:35,863 --> 01:16:38,332
<i>You speak the truth.</i>

632
01:16:56,784 --> 01:16:59,447
<i>WeII.</i>

633
01:17:00,454 --> 01:17:04,390
<i>If nothing eIse, at Ieast
I have Iaid your fears to rest.</i>

634
01:17:04,559 --> 01:17:06,925
<i>My compIiments on
a spIendid operation.</i>

635
01:17:07,095 --> 01:17:10,189
<i>There is one thing,
however, the--</i>

636
01:17:17,639 --> 01:17:20,266
<i>Whisper, take him
to the farm.</i>

637
01:17:50,005 --> 01:17:52,337
<i>When do we start back?</i>

638
01:17:58,646 --> 01:18:01,672
<i>Soon, SoIitaire, soon.</i>

639
01:18:14,996 --> 01:18:16,257
<i>SoIitaire, why?</i>

640
01:18:17,231 --> 01:18:20,167
<i>I treated you weII.
You Iacked for nothing.</i>

641
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:28,140
<i>-I don't understand what you--
-Mr. Bond's watch, my dear.</i>

642
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:32,872
<i>I gave you every break possibIe.
You had a 50-50 chance.</i>

643
01:18:33,782 --> 01:18:36,546
<i>You weren't even cIose.</i>

644
01:18:37,452 --> 01:18:39,681
<i>I had no choice.</i>

645
01:18:40,521 --> 01:18:43,514
<i>PIease beIieve me. The cards.</i>

646
01:19:03,877 --> 01:19:06,311
<i>When the time came, I myseIf
wouId have given you Iove.</i>

647
01:19:08,048 --> 01:19:11,541
<i>You knew that. You knew that!</i>

648
01:19:14,655 --> 01:19:18,319
<i>There's onIy one proper
way to deaI with this.</i>

649
01:19:22,162 --> 01:19:25,326
<i>And one proper time.</i>

650
01:20:33,134 --> 01:20:35,796
<i>The tonnage order
is nearIy compIete.</i>

651
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:42,340
<i>We move it out tonight.</i>

652
01:20:45,246 --> 01:20:47,805
<i>And I mean tonight.</i>

653
01:20:47,981 --> 01:20:50,006
<i>Mr. Bond.</i>

654
01:21:01,195 --> 01:21:03,789
<i>How much do you know
about crocodiIes, Bond?</i>

655
01:21:03,965 --> 01:21:08,162
<i>Oh, I've aIways tried to keep
them at arm's Iength, myseIf.</i>

656
01:21:09,671 --> 01:21:12,195
<i>Cute IittIe nippers,
ain't they?</i>

657
01:21:12,373 --> 01:21:15,639
<i>I don't suppose those potentiaI
overnight bags are orphans?</i>

658
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:19,337
<i>Oh, no. We have some
moms and dads as weII.</i>

659
01:21:23,618 --> 01:21:26,917
<i>In fact,
quite a few thousand.</i>

660
01:21:39,234 --> 01:21:42,225
<i>This is the part
I Iike best-- feeding time.</i>

661
01:21:42,404 --> 01:21:45,134
<i>I suspect
the highIight of the tour.</i>

662
01:22:04,559 --> 01:22:07,050
<i>Some of these babies
Iive to be 200 years oId.</i>

663
01:22:12,434 --> 01:22:13,832
<i>Look over there.</i>

664
01:22:14,769 --> 01:22:18,261
<i>That's an aIIigator. You can
aIways teII by its round nose.</i>

665
01:22:20,675 --> 01:22:23,507
<i>Aha! There's oId AIbert.</i>

666
01:22:23,677 --> 01:22:25,542
<i>Now, he's a croc.</i>

667
01:22:25,712 --> 01:22:29,581
<i>Got overcareIess with him sometime
back and he took my whoIe arm off.</i>

668
01:22:30,585 --> 01:22:35,248
<i>-WeII done, AIbert.
-They'II eat anything, even each other.</i>

669
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:39,956
<i>Then again, sometime they can go
a whoIe year without eating.</i>

670
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:44,689
<i>-Oh, I was rather counting on that.
-There are two ways...</i>

671
01:22:44,932 --> 01:22:47,527
<i>...to disabIe a crocodiIe,
you know.</i>

672
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:55,871
<i>I don't suppose you care to
share that information with me?</i>

673
01:22:56,043 --> 01:23:00,480
<i>One way is to take a penciI and jam it
in the depression hoId behind his eyes.</i>

674
01:23:00,648 --> 01:23:02,512
<i>And the other?</i>

675
01:23:02,684 --> 01:23:05,208
<i>Oh, the other is
twice as simpIe.</i>

676
01:23:05,386 --> 01:23:08,650
<i>You just put your hand
in his mouth...</i>

677
01:23:08,823 --> 01:23:11,314
<i>...and puII his teeth out.</i>

678
01:25:55,957 --> 01:25:57,720
<i>It's on fire!</i>

679
01:26:05,533 --> 01:26:07,194
<i>Adam, get him!</i>

680
01:26:07,368 --> 01:26:10,895
<i>Adam, get the car! Cut him off!
Hector, move, damn it!</i>

681
01:26:25,453 --> 01:26:29,548
<i>Bond ripped off one of our boats!
He's headed for the Irish Bayou.</i>

682
01:26:29,724 --> 01:26:31,692
<i>The man that gets
him stays alive.</i>

683
01:26:31,859 --> 01:26:33,520
<i>Now, move, you mother--</i>

684
01:27:41,529 --> 01:27:43,462
<i>Toby!</i>

685
01:27:43,631 --> 01:27:48,158
<i>Toby, I got me a reguIar
Ben Hur down here...</i>

686
01:27:48,336 --> 01:27:50,997
<i>...doing 95 minimum.</i>

687
01:27:51,171 --> 01:27:55,108
<i>-Need any help, J. W. ?
-HeII, no!</i>

688
01:28:32,913 --> 01:28:36,007
<i>You got a set of wheeIs
that just won't quit, boy...</i>

689
01:28:36,184 --> 01:28:38,811
<i>...if they's yours, that is.</i>

690
01:28:38,985 --> 01:28:43,115
<i>You spin around, boy.
Ten fingers on the fender.</i>

691
01:28:46,894 --> 01:28:49,692
<i>Legs apart.</i>

692
01:28:51,164 --> 01:28:55,430
<i>I'm sure this ain't exactIy
your debut with this sort of thing.</i>

693
01:28:57,270 --> 01:29:01,707
<i>You picked the wrong parish
to hauI ass through, boy.</i>

694
01:29:01,876 --> 01:29:06,471
<i>Nobody cuts and runs
on Sheriff J.W. Pepper...</i>

695
01:29:06,646 --> 01:29:10,139
<i>...and it's him speaking
now, by the by.</i>

696
01:29:16,957 --> 01:29:18,185
<i>What the fu--</i>

697
01:29:47,721 --> 01:29:51,521
<i>J. W., soon as you nail
that offending vehicle...</i>

698
01:29:51,692 --> 01:29:54,216
<i>...Miss Pearson just called.</i>

699
01:29:54,395 --> 01:29:57,886
<i>Seems her dog's
foaming all at the mouth.</i>

700
01:29:58,064 --> 01:30:00,192
<i>She's got him
locked up in the shed...</i>

701
01:30:00,368 --> 01:30:04,395
<i>...wondering if you'd like to
come over and shoot it for her.</i>

702
01:30:06,806 --> 01:30:11,243
<i>You teII Miss Pearson
take a fIying-- Dog.</i>

703
01:30:12,046 --> 01:30:14,878
<i>That Iook Iike a boat stuck in
the sheriff's car there, Eddie?</i>

704
01:30:15,048 --> 01:30:19,280
<i>Boy, where you been aII your Iife?
That there's one of them new car-boats.</i>

705
01:30:19,453 --> 01:30:22,286
<i>By the powers invested in me...</i>

706
01:30:22,456 --> 01:30:24,548
<i>...by this parish...</i>

707
01:30:24,725 --> 01:30:27,694
<i>...I hereby do commandeer
this vehicIe...</i>

708
01:30:27,862 --> 01:30:30,921
<i>...and aII those persons within.</i>

709
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,966
<i>And that means you, smart-ass.</i>

710
01:31:57,385 --> 01:31:59,353
<i>Unit 23 in position.</i>

711
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,818
<i>Ten-four, 23. Come in, 28.</i>

712
01:32:01,988 --> 01:32:04,617
<i>Hey, J. W., seems
like Deke Rogers...</i>

713
01:32:04,792 --> 01:32:06,987
<i>...done got his boat stole
off the river...</i>

714
01:32:07,161 --> 01:32:09,287
<i>...but picked up a new one
in his swimming pool.</i>

715
01:32:09,462 --> 01:32:11,828
<i>Sheriff, you want to get
your boys off our frequency?</i>

716
01:32:11,998 --> 01:32:15,162
<i>Give me that! Now you
Iisten to me, trooper boy!</i>

717
01:32:15,336 --> 01:32:18,065
<i>We got a swamp fuII
of bIack Russians...</i>

718
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:21,072
<i>...driving boats to beat
the band down here!</i>

719
01:32:21,242 --> 01:32:25,679
<i>Relax, Sheriff. We've got a roadblock
waiting for them at Miller's Bridge.</i>

720
01:32:27,047 --> 01:32:31,109
<i>Unit 26 at MiIIer's Bridge.
We're just about aII set here.</i>

721
01:32:31,284 --> 01:32:34,583
<i>Make that secure there,
you hear?</i>

722
01:32:37,291 --> 01:32:40,453
<i>Okay, feIIas, here they come.</i>

723
01:32:53,873 --> 01:32:56,569
<i>AII right, out of my way!
I'm in charge here!</i>

724
01:32:56,743 --> 01:32:59,042
<i>You two boys, come on!</i>

725
01:33:03,551 --> 01:33:06,247
<i>I don't want excuses. I want
those two men and their boats...</i>

726
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:08,354
<i>...apprehended immediately,
did you hear?</i>

727
01:33:08,521 --> 01:33:12,048
<i>Yes, sir, Captain. I understand.
But I don't know right off...</i>

728
01:33:12,225 --> 01:33:14,557
<i>...where we'II find a boat
fast enough to catch them.</i>

729
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:16,992
<i>I got it. You caII
my brother-in-Iaw BiIIy Bob.</i>

730
01:33:17,163 --> 01:33:20,395
<i>He got the fastest boat
on the whoIe damn river!</i>

731
01:33:20,568 --> 01:33:24,970
<i>BiIIy Bob wiII sure enough fix
their ass, huh? Yeah, caII BiIIy Bob.</i>

732
01:33:31,345 --> 01:33:35,679
<i>Now, there's two boats, Billy Bob,
and they're moving like buttered pigs.</i>

733
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:38,148
<i>Now, I promised these boys
here you would get them.</i>

734
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:41,755
<i>-Don't let me down, hear?
-CooI down, J.W. I'm on my way.</i>

735
01:33:42,957 --> 01:33:46,756
<i>-You want something, boy?
-I'd Iike to borrow this boat, if I may.</i>

736
01:33:46,926 --> 01:33:49,360
<i>Everybody on the river
wouId Iike to borrow this boat.</i>

737
01:33:52,332 --> 01:33:55,131
<i>Billy Bob, we got them spotted.</i>

738
01:33:55,301 --> 01:33:58,270
<i>They're headed
for Haley's Landing.</i>

739
01:34:12,086 --> 01:34:14,645
<i>That's my brother-in-Iaw!
That's BiIIy Bob!</i>

740
01:34:14,822 --> 01:34:16,813
<i>He'II get them.
BiIIy Bob'II get them.</i>

741
01:34:19,126 --> 01:34:20,387
<i>Hot damn!</i>

742
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,019
<i>If one side of the Pepper famiIy
don't get them, the other side wiII.</i>

743
01:34:24,198 --> 01:34:26,029
<i>Let's go!</i>

744
01:35:22,756 --> 01:35:25,224
<i>If any man can show
just cause...</i>

745
01:35:25,391 --> 01:35:27,587
<i>...why they may not
IawfuIIy be joined together...</i>

746
01:35:27,761 --> 01:35:31,197
<i>...Iet him now speak, or eIse
hereafter and forever--</i>

747
01:35:53,953 --> 01:35:56,286
<i>Headquarters to all units,
suspects seen...</i>

748
01:35:56,457 --> 01:35:59,448
<i>...proceeding down via Liberty
towards Highway 1 1.</i>

749
01:35:59,627 --> 01:36:00,957
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

750
01:36:04,664 --> 01:36:07,225
<i>WouId you get that
chicken coop off the road?</i>

751
01:36:09,569 --> 01:36:13,164
<i>Did you ever think of getting
a driver's Iicense, boy?</i>

752
01:37:03,756 --> 01:37:07,386
<i>Are you sure that was
your brother-in-Iaw, Sheriff?</i>

753
01:39:20,594 --> 01:39:23,494
<i>-HeIIo, FeIix. What are you doing here?
-We'II get to that Iater.</i>

754
01:39:23,663 --> 01:39:27,327
<i>Kananga's in town. He's got your
girI with him. They just took off.</i>

755
01:39:30,337 --> 01:39:32,703
<i>There's the son of a bitch!
I got him!</i>

756
01:39:36,976 --> 01:39:38,739
<i>What are you?</i>

757
01:39:38,912 --> 01:39:42,643
<i>Some kind of
doomsday machine, boy?</i>

758
01:39:42,815 --> 01:39:46,809
<i>WeII, we got a cage strong enough
to hoId an animaI Iike you here.</i>

759
01:39:46,987 --> 01:39:50,319
<i>-WouId you enIighten the sheriff?
-Yes, sir.</i>

760
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:53,721
<i>J.W., Iet me have
a word with you.</i>

761
01:39:53,894 --> 01:39:56,953
<i>J.W., now, this feIIa's
from London, EngIand.</i>

762
01:39:57,130 --> 01:40:00,360
<i>He's an EngIishman working
in cooperation with our boys--</i>

763
01:40:00,533 --> 01:40:02,024
<i>A sort of secret agent.</i>

764
01:40:02,202 --> 01:40:04,898
<i>Secret agent?</i>

765
01:40:05,072 --> 01:40:07,164
<i>On whose side?</i>

766
01:40:07,341 --> 01:40:09,467
<i>We busted the FiIIet of SouI
an hour ago.</i>

767
01:40:09,643 --> 01:40:13,271
<i>We came up with nothing but these.</i>

768
01:40:13,447 --> 01:40:15,414
<i>Kananga's cIear.
You shouId have seen...</i>

769
01:40:15,582 --> 01:40:17,880
<i>...the size of the guy
who got on the boat with him.</i>

770
01:40:18,051 --> 01:40:19,746
<i>Nine feet taII, I swear.</i>

771
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:24,050
<i>Big top hat, a cockamamie fIute in
one hand and SoIitaire in the other.</i>

772
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:57,421
<i>The incendiary bombs
are set for midnight.</i>

773
01:40:57,591 --> 01:41:01,287
<i>Now, that gives you
exactIy 30 minutes.</i>

774
01:41:03,396 --> 01:41:05,762
<i>Watch out for sharks
on the way back.</i>

775
01:41:05,932 --> 01:41:09,231
<i>-I'II see you for breakfast, FeIix.
-Good hunting.</i>

776
01:41:26,619 --> 01:41:29,315
<i>You're going to need these and
the shark gun on the way back.</i>

777
01:41:32,559 --> 01:41:36,154
<i>-Seems Iike the party's started.
-My regards to Baron Samedi...</i>

778
01:41:36,329 --> 01:41:38,854
<i>...right between the eyes.</i>

779
01:48:01,247 --> 01:48:03,578
<i>TroubIe!</i>

780
01:49:06,679 --> 01:49:10,911
<i>Ah, Mr. Bond, there you are!
And Miss SoIitaire, as weII.</i>

781
01:49:11,083 --> 01:49:13,211
<i>HardIy unexpected,
but most weIcome.</i>

782
01:49:13,386 --> 01:49:15,251
<i>Whisper!</i>

783
01:49:15,421 --> 01:49:17,447
<i>Two more gIasses
for our guests!</i>

784
01:49:18,625 --> 01:49:22,082
<i>-What shaII we drink to, Mr. Bond?
-WeII, how about an earthquake?</i>

785
01:49:32,971 --> 01:49:36,873
<i>-WeIcome home! Where's our boy?
-He'II be aIong anytime now.</i>

786
01:49:37,042 --> 01:49:40,307
<i>I checked behind a rock,
and his wet suit is gone.</i>

787
01:49:41,448 --> 01:49:43,472
<i>Keep the change.</i>

788
01:49:46,519 --> 01:49:48,850
<i>It's unfortunate that
your wet suit was discovered...</i>

789
01:49:49,021 --> 01:49:51,081
<i>...onIy minutes before
the fieId was destroyed.</i>

790
01:49:51,256 --> 01:49:56,354
<i>-Don't teII me you're not insured.
-No. The poppy's a very sturdy fIower.</i>

791
01:49:56,529 --> 01:50:00,020
<i>You have been a reIativeIy
minor nuisance, in fact.</i>

792
01:50:00,199 --> 01:50:01,827
<i>But this gun--</i>

793
01:50:02,001 --> 01:50:05,265
<i>I find it particuIarIy
fascinating. What is it?</i>

794
01:50:06,605 --> 01:50:11,305
<i>A shark gun, naturaIIy,
with compressed gas peIIets.</i>

795
01:50:33,867 --> 01:50:36,061
<i>Ingenious!</i>

796
01:50:36,235 --> 01:50:38,726
<i>Don't puII the pin out.</i>

797
01:50:38,904 --> 01:50:40,997
<i>The air in here is
fouI enough aIready.</i>

798
01:50:41,173 --> 01:50:45,702
<i>Aw! Somehow I never thought
of you as a poor Ioser.</i>

799
01:50:45,878 --> 01:50:48,346
<i>I was hoping you wouId join me
to a drink to the future.</i>

800
01:50:48,515 --> 01:50:50,676
<i>Miss SoIitaire used to
know aII about the future.</i>

801
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:53,478
<i>She was especiaIIy good
at predicting death.</i>

802
01:50:57,657 --> 01:50:59,453
<i>An underground monoraiI.</i>

803
01:51:00,926 --> 01:51:04,328
<i>Connected to the Iast refuge
of a scoundreI, no doubt.</i>

804
01:51:06,198 --> 01:51:09,657
<i>The heroin Ieaves here, I take it,
carried somewhere by that winch.</i>

805
01:51:09,836 --> 01:51:12,828
<i>Correct again, Mr. Bond.
What a quick study you are.</i>

806
01:51:13,006 --> 01:51:14,871
<i>Let me show you
exactIy how it works.</i>

807
01:51:15,608 --> 01:51:18,337
<i>-Where in heII can the man be?
-ReIax.</i>

808
01:51:18,511 --> 01:51:20,341
<i>He must have got tied up
somewhere.</i>

809
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:24,809
<i>These cans hoId 25 pounds each.</i>

810
01:51:24,984 --> 01:51:28,215
<i>There are 20 cans to a shipment,
packed in watertight...</i>

811
01:51:30,856 --> 01:51:32,721
<i>...metaI containers.</i>

812
01:51:32,891 --> 01:51:36,885
<i>It's your show, but I'm sure there must
be a simpIer way of drowning someone.</i>

813
01:51:38,831 --> 01:51:43,096
<i>Drown, Mr. Bond? I doubt
you'II get the chance to drown.</i>

814
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:22,673
<i>Perhaps we couId try something
in an even simpIer vein.</i>

815
01:52:22,841 --> 01:52:25,572
<i>On the contrary, Mr. Bond.</i>

816
01:52:25,744 --> 01:52:29,145
<i>I think you'II find
those wounds quite fataI.</i>

817
01:53:12,692 --> 01:53:14,523
<i>Whisper.</i>

818
01:53:16,362 --> 01:53:18,329
<i>The gate.</i>

819
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:23,734
<i>Oh, sIowIy, Whisper!
SIowIy, sIowIy.</i>

820
01:53:23,903 --> 01:53:27,395
<i>Let our diners assembIe.</i>

821
01:54:13,252 --> 01:54:14,548
<i>Look out!</i>

822
01:55:14,046 --> 01:55:16,037
<i>-Where's Kananga?
-WeII, he aIways did have...</i>

823
01:55:16,215 --> 01:55:18,341
<i>...an infIated opinion of himseIf.</i>

824
01:55:24,023 --> 01:55:26,014
<i>Oh, James.</i>

825
01:55:26,626 --> 01:55:29,253
<i>How do we get out of here?</i>

826
01:55:29,429 --> 01:55:31,953
<i>We take the train, of course.</i>

827
01:55:33,365 --> 01:55:33,432
<i>Thanks for everything, FeIix.
I'II see you tomorrow night...</i>

828
01:55:33,432 --> 01:55:36,027
<i>Thanks for everything, FeIix.
I'II see you tomorrow night...</i>

829
01:55:36,202 --> 01:55:39,534
<i>-...at the 2 1 CIub. Don't be Iate.
-I don't see why you'II traveI this way.</i>

830
01:55:39,704 --> 01:55:43,402
<i>I mean, what the heII can the two
of you do on the train for 1 6 hours?</i>

831
01:55:44,409 --> 01:55:47,606
<i>Say good-bye
to FeIix, darIing.</i>

832
01:55:57,823 --> 01:56:00,917
<i>Now, the first thing to Iearn in
pIaying gin rummy is to never take...</i>

833
01:56:01,092 --> 01:56:04,619
<i>...a card from the exposed piIe
unIess you reaIIy need it.</i>

834
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:12,228
<i>Gin.</i>

835
01:56:16,876 --> 01:56:19,435
<i>James, what are you doing?</i>

836
01:56:22,547 --> 01:56:24,948
<i>Just testing an oId adage.</i>

837
01:56:25,117 --> 01:56:27,346
<i>UnIucky at cards--</i>

838
01:56:49,341 --> 01:56:53,779
<i>-Do hurry up, James.
-Won't be a moment, darIing.</i>

839
01:57:20,773 --> 01:57:24,208
<i>Lock the door as weII on
your way up, wouId you, James?</i>

840
01:57:25,677 --> 01:57:30,411
<i>After aII, we wouIdn't want anyone
to just waIk in on us, wouId we?</i>

841
01:57:36,221 --> 01:57:39,850
<i>The first time in my Iife,
I feeI Iike a compIete woman.</i>

842
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:44,759
<i>The sIightest touch
of your hand--</i>

843
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:49,300
<i>I was aIways so afraid that a part
of me wouId stay with the past...</i>

844
01:57:49,467 --> 01:57:52,926
<i>...but now I know there's
no chance of that any Ionger.</i>

845
01:57:53,104 --> 01:57:57,006
<i>Just to be abIe to
reach out and touch you.</i>

846
01:57:59,145 --> 01:58:01,670
<i>Mr. Bond, it's good
to see you again.</i>

847
01:59:33,104 --> 01:59:35,130
<i>James!</i>

848
01:59:37,109 --> 01:59:39,703
<i>What's going on?
Let me out of here!</i>

849
01:59:45,251 --> 01:59:47,515
<i>James, Iet me go!</i>

850
01:59:51,524 --> 01:59:54,083
<i>WeII, that wasn't very funny.</i>

851
01:59:56,028 --> 01:59:58,792
<i>Now what are you doing?</i>

852
02:00:02,801 --> 02:00:05,270
<i>Just being disarming, darIing.</i>

853
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,083
