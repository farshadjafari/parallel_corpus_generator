1
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:07,857
<i>One con under escort.
Open gate one.</i>

2
00:00:10,902 --> 00:00:12,737
<i>Man walking.</i>

3
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:15,533
<i>Open gate two.</i>

4
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:24,249
<i>Let's go. Face the wall.
Got one under escort.</i>

5
00:00:40,348 --> 00:00:42,851
- Good morning.
- Morning.

6
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:46,646
- State your name for the record.
- Daniel Ocean.

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,817
Thank you. The purpose of this
hearing is to determine...

8
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:54,154
...whether you are
likely to break the law again.

9
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:58,825
This was your first conviction,
but you've been implicated...

10
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,953
...in a dozen other schemes
and frauds.

11
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,706
What can you tell us about this?

12
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:08,501
As you say, ma'am,
I was never charged.

13
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:11,588
We're trying to find out...

14
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:14,716
...if there was a reason
for committing this crime...

15
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:17,886
...or just a reason
you got caught this time.

16
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:22,974
My wife left me. I was upset.
I got into a self-destructive pattern.

17
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:28,772
If released, is it likely you'd fall
back into a similar pattern?

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,526
She left me once. I doubt
she'd do it again just for kicks.

19
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:39,407
Mr. Ocean, what do you think
you would do if released?

20
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:04,868
- Chips, please.
- Sure.

21
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:11,332
- Change 150. Quarters or nickels?
- Quarters are fine.

22
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,796
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:27,557
20. Dealer has 19.
Good start.

24
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:35,398
- I'm going on break now.
- Here. Thank you very much.

25
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,527
- Good luck.
- You have a good one.

26
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:43,364
- How are you, sir?
- Hello, Frank.

27
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,998
I beg your pardon. You must have me
confused with someone else.

28
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:56,002
My name is Ramón.
As you can see right here.

29
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:02,217
- My mistake.
- No problem, sir.

30
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:05,136
The table's cold anyway.

31
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:09,891
You might want to try the lounge
at Caesars. Gets busy after 1:00.

32
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,935
- 1:00?
- Yes, sir.

33
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:14,604
Thanks, Ramón.

34
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:17,357
Thank you.

35
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:30,745
- Checking up on current events?
- Ramón?

36
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:35,917
Glad to meet you. Frank Catton
can't get past the gaming board.

37
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:38,545
- You just got out?
- This afternoon.

38
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,130
You seen him?

39
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:45,468
I heard he was teaching movie stars
how to play cards. Why?

40
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,804
You have a plan already?

41
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:51,266
Are you kidding?
I just became a citizen again.

42
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:52,809
<i>Officer Brooks...</i>

43
00:04:53,184 --> 00:04:57,772
...this is Danny Ocean. I was told
to contact you within 24 hours.

44
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,985
No, sir, I haven't
been getting in trouble.

45
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:06,114
No, sir, I haven't been drinking.

46
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:09,576
No, sir, I wouldn't even think
about leaving the state.

47
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:27,343
Hey, Russ! Rusty. What's up, man?

48
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:34,601
Let me ask you a question.
Are you incorporated?

49
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:38,605
You should think about it.
I talked to my manager...

50
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:42,567
- Bernie?
- Not Bernie. My business manager.

51
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,528
Actually, they're both named Bernie.

52
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:49,908
He said what we do could
be considered research...

53
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:54,162
...for a future gig, so I could
make it a tax write-off.

54
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,249
The one thing is, and this is
his thing and it's stupid...

55
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,461
...but I'd have to pay you by check.

56
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,052
Or we could just stick to cash.

57
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,721
Yeah, let's just stick to cash.

58
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:23,483
We'll begin with five-card draw.
Everyone remember that?

59
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,569
Who wants to start us out? Josh?

60
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,407
Josh. To the left.

61
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,201
Deal to your left.

62
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,994
- Shane?
- Hit me.

63
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:37,914
- It's not blackjack.
- Dude!

64
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,586
Looking at them doesn't change them.
You know what you have.

65
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,548
- Left. Left.
- Left, I'll get it.

66
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:48,925
Lady bets. Let's keep it moving.

67
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:51,594
- Blue.
- Blue, that's a 50.

68
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:53,513
- I'll call?
- Okay.

69
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:55,890
Shane's calling. 50.

70
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,893
What the hell, it's only
pocket change.

71
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:02,856
That's your business.
Pretend it's for a reason.

72
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:04,441
Yeah, thanks, man.

73
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,860
- Right.
- How many?

74
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:11,030
- Four.
- You don't want four. You wanna fold.

75
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:12,991
- I wanna fold?
- Fold.

76
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,617
Is that good?

77
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:18,204
You're done. Let's take that.
You're done.

78
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,708
You're done.
You have three pairs.

79
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,462
You can't have six cards
in a five-card game.

80
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:27,839
- Maybe one was mine.
- Wasn't me.

81
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,132
Fellas!

82
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:32,469
All reds.

83
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:35,388
What up, dog?

84
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:45,565
I'm gonna love spending your money.
I'm gonna get my car washed.

85
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:03,124
- How's the game going?
- Longest hour of my life.

86
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:07,003
- What?
- I'm running away with your wife.

87
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:08,963
Great.

88
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:22,143
Isn't that hard, crossing over
from television to film?

89
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:24,312
Not for me, dude.

90
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:28,191
Hey, Russ. We got another player...

91
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,443
...if that's cool with you.

92
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:36,658
What do you do for a living?
If you don't mind me asking.

93
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:39,119
Why would I mind you asking?

94
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,745
Two cards.

95
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,498
I just got out of prison.

96
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,211
- Really?
- Why were you in prison?

97
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:50,839
I stole things.

98
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:54,551
You stole things?
Like jewels?

99
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:58,096
Incan matrimonial head masks.

100
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:03,101
- Any money in Incan matrimonial...?
- Head masks. Some.

101
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,355
Don't let him fool you.
There's loads if you can move them.

102
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:11,025
I'll take one. But you can't.

103
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:14,362
- My fence was confident.
- You don't need a fence.

104
00:09:14,571 --> 00:09:18,116
- Some people lack vision.
- Everybody in cellblock E.

105
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,118
That's $500.

106
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:24,706
- What's the first lesson in poker?
- Never bet on the...

107
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:27,542
- Leave emotion at the door.
- Right, Topher.

108
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,587
Today's lesson:
How to draw out the bluff.

109
00:09:30,795 --> 00:09:32,964
That much money, this early...

110
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:36,634
He has nothing better than
a pair of face cards.

111
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:38,303
Barry?

112
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:42,599
All right.

113
00:09:43,057 --> 00:09:44,851
I fold.

114
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:49,522
- Josh?
- Don't worry, I'm game.

115
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:54,486
I will see your $500
and I will raise you another...

116
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:58,531
...$500 of my own.
- That's a very handsome bet.

117
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:04,412
But don't push him too high, too fast.
Keep him on the leash.

118
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,623
- Holly?
- Call.

119
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:08,792
Call.

120
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:11,336
And I'll call.

121
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:18,676
I'll see your $500
and raise you $2000.

122
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:22,847
Guys, you do what you like.
That's a lot of money.

123
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:28,269
I'm staying in. He's trying to buy
his way out of his bluff.

124
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,315
- Josh?
- Two.

125
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:39,072
Thattagirl. Call.

126
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:42,283
- Call.
- Call.

127
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:46,913
Let's see them.

128
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:53,002
I'm not sure what four nines does,
but the ace, I think, is pretty high.

129
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:56,422
Thanks for the tip on bluffing.

130
00:10:57,048 --> 00:11:02,011
Hey, Topher! How about an autograph?
Come on, real quick.

131
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:21,614
- God, I'm bored.
- You look bored.

132
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:26,077
How was the clink?
You get the cookies I sent?

133
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:29,581
Why do you think
I came to see you first?

134
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:32,750
<i>- So tell me.
- It's tricky.</i>

135
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:37,630
It's never been done before.
It'll need planning and a large crew.

136
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:41,926
- Guns?
- Not quite. High security. The take...

137
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:44,220
- The target?
- Eight figures.

138
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:46,347
What's the target?

139
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,977
When was the last time
you were in Vegas?

140
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:53,980
You want to knock over a casino?

141
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:09,245
The vault at the Bellagio.

142
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:18,087
If I'm reading this right,
and I'd like to think I am...

143
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:23,051
...this is probably the least
accessible vault ever designed.

144
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,179
You said three casinos?

145
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:32,393
These feed into the Mirage and MGM
Grand, but every dime ends up there.

146
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:35,939
The Bellagio and the Mirage.

147
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:40,318
- These are Terry Benedict's places.
- Yes, they are.

148
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:43,404
- Think he'll mind?
- More than somewhat.

149
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:47,700
You'd need at least 12 guys
doing a combination of cons.

150
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,577
Like what, you think?

151
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:55,041
Off the top of my head, I'd say you're
looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown...

152
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,669
...a Miss Daisy and a Leon Spinks.

153
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,798
Not to mention the biggest
Ella Fitzgerald ever.

154
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:04,884
Where will you get
the money to back this?

155
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:08,221
Hit these three casinos,
we'll get our bankroll.

156
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,849
Benedict's got a list of enemies.

157
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:14,936
But enemies with loose
cash and nothing to lose?

158
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:19,732
- Reuben.
- Reuben.

159
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:21,443
Hey.

160
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,113
Oscar, lower it a bit,
would you?

161
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:28,700
Sorry. You guys done?
Find what you want?

162
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,995
We'll take these for the night
to make copies.

163
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:35,206
- Whatever you need.
- Appreciate it.

164
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:43,965
What?

165
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:47,051
I need a reason.

166
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:50,305
And don't say money. Why do this?

167
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:52,640
Why not do it?

168
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:01,608
I just left the joint after
losing four years of my life...

169
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:04,903
<i>...and you're cold-decking
Teen Beat cover boys.</i>

170
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:09,032
Because the house always wins.

171
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,410
Play long enough,
the house takes you.

172
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:18,333
Unless, when that perfect hand comes,
you bet big. Then you take the house.

173
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:24,130
- You practiced that speech?
- Did I rush it?

174
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,841
<i>It was good.
The Teen Beat thing was harsh.</i>

175
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,972
I wonder what Reuben will say.

176
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:36,559
You're out of your damn minds!

177
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,063
You're both of you nuts!

178
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:45,735
I know more about casino security
than any man. I invented it.

179
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:47,821
And it cannot be beaten.

180
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:51,199
They got cameras and watchers,
they got locks.

181
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,243
They got timers, vaults.

182
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:57,038
They got enough armed
personnel to occupy Paris!

183
00:14:58,081 --> 00:15:00,291
Okay, bad example.

184
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,252
It's never been tried.

185
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:07,882
It's been tried.
A few guys even came close.

186
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:11,803
You know the three most successful
robberies in Vegas?

187
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,013
Number three, the bronze medal.

188
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:17,350
Pencil neck grabs
a lockbox at the Horseshoe.

189
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,853
Grab the guy in the suit!

190
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:24,399
He got two steps closer
to the door than anyone before.

191
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:25,775
Leave the money!

192
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:27,944
Second most successful robbery:

193
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:32,657
The Flamingo in '71. This guy
actually tasted fresh oxygen...

194
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,909
...before they grabbed him.

195
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:39,914
Of course, he was breathing out
of a hose for the next three weeks.

196
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:41,916
Goddamn hippie.

197
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:47,505
And the closest any man has come
to robbing a Las Vegas casino...

198
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:50,967
...was outside of Caesars in '87.

199
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:53,136
He came...

200
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:55,472
...he grabbed...

201
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:58,183
...they conquered.

202
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:07,984
But what am I saying?
You guys are pros. The best.

203
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:11,279
I'm sure you can make
it out of the casino.

204
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:13,740
Of course, lest we forget...

205
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:19,245
...once you're out, you're still
in the middle of the fucking desert!

206
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:21,164
You're right.
He's right.

207
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:24,167
Our eyes were bigger
than our stomachs.

208
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,545
- That's what it is. Ego.
- Yeah, blah, blah.

209
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:30,757
- Thanks for lunch.
- The nicoise was delicious.

210
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:34,135
- Sorry to bother you.
- Look, we go way back...

211
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:37,847
...and I owe you from the thing
with the guy.

212
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:40,517
- Our pleasure.
- I'd never been to Belize.

213
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:45,688
Give Dominic your addresses.
I got some furniture to send you.

214
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:52,779
Just out of curiosity, which casinos
did you geniuses pick to rob?

215
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,367
The Bellagio, the Mirage
and the MGM Grand.

216
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:02,664
Those are Terry Benedict's casinos.

217
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:05,250
- Is that right?
- That's right.

218
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,919
You guys...

219
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:11,798
...what do you got against
Terry Benedict?

220
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:15,677
What do you have against him?
That's the question.

221
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:20,640
He torpedoed my casino.
Muscled me out.

222
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:26,187
Now he's gonna blow it up next month
to make way for some monstrosity.

223
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:30,066
- I see what you're doing.
- What are we doing?

224
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:35,989
If you're gonna steal from Terry
Benedict, you better goddamn know.

225
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:40,326
This used to be civilized.
You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you.

226
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:42,412
But Benedict...

227
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:47,292
At the end of it, he'd better not
know you're involved.

228
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,338
Because he'll kill you,
then he'll go to work on you.

229
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:56,843
That's why we have to be
very careful, very precise.

230
00:17:57,093 --> 00:17:58,470
Well-funded.

231
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:01,598
You gotta be nuts, too.

232
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:06,102
And you're gonna need
a crew as nuts as you are.

233
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:11,232
Who do you got in mind?

234
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:14,736
<i>- All right, who 's in?
- Frank C. Is in.</i>

235
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:21,409
<i>Frank has bronchitis and is applying
for a transfer to warmer climates.</i>

236
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:28,208
<i>Drivers?</i>

237
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,960
<i>- I talked to the Malloys.
- Mormon twins?</i>

238
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:33,630
<i>They're in Utah, off the job.</i>

239
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:37,342
<i>They're having
trouble filling the hours.</i>

240
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:55,026
- Waiting, sweetheart.
- Good. Go.

241
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,611
- Waiting for you.
- Why?

242
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,696
- You're a little girl!
- Relax.

243
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:03,493
I'm going to get out and
drop you like third-period French.

244
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,036
Relax.

245
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,201
<i>- Electronics?
- Livingston Dell.</i>

246
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:49,539
<i>He's been doing surveillance
work for the FBI mob squad.</i>

247
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:52,125
<i>- How are his nerves?
- Not so bad.</i>

248
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,669
Move in a little bit.

249
00:19:56,379 --> 00:20:00,341
- Don't touch that.
- Why not?

250
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:04,971
Do you see me grabbing your gun
and waving it around?

251
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:07,766
Hey, RadioShack. Relax.

252
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:18,818
Munitions.

253
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,070
- Phil Turrentine.
- Dead.

254
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:23,740
- No shit. On the job?
- Skin cancer.

255
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:27,327
- You send flowers?
- Dated his wife for a while.

256
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,704
Basher's in town.

257
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,333
There may be an issue
with availability.

258
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:41,299
All right, chaps...

259
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:44,552
...hang on to your knickers.

260
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,948
Oh, leave it out!

261
00:21:07,325 --> 00:21:10,787
You tossers!
You had one job to do!

262
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,377
<i>That's all you used in the event?</i>

263
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,922
- You accusing me of booby-trapping?
- Well?

264
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:25,301
Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.
Isn't that right?

265
00:21:25,802 --> 00:21:27,262
Basher?

266
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:29,639
Peck. ATF.

267
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,683
Let me venture a guess.

268
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:37,355
Simple G-4 mainliner, back wound,
quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet.

269
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:40,984
Let me ask you this.
You search this scumbag...

270
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:44,320
...for booby traps?
I mean, really searched.

271
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:46,072
Stand back.

272
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,949
Here we go.

273
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:50,743
- Find Griggs. I need him.
- Who?

274
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,912
Just find him, will you?

275
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:57,959
Can you put something together
with what I gave you?

276
00:21:58,209 --> 00:21:59,377
Done.

277
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,923
- Is Danny about?
- He's around the corner.

278
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:08,094
Terrific. It'll be nice working
with proper villains again.

279
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:10,722
Everybody down! Get down!

280
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,059
They weren't expecting that shit!

281
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:17,020
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

282
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:40,084
- Which one's the Amazing Yen?
- The little Chinese guy.

283
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:47,592
- Who else is on the list?
- He is the list.

284
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:54,224
It doesn't seem that diff...

285
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:07,654
- We got a grease man.
- We got a grease man.

286
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,951
We need Saul.

287
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:17,038
- He got out of the game a year ago.
- He get religion?

288
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:19,040
Ulcers.

289
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:24,295
- You could ask him.
- Hey, I could ask him.

290
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:55,118
I saw you at the paddock...

291
00:23:55,452 --> 00:24:00,457
...before the second race, outside
the men's room when I placed my bet.

292
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:04,836
I saw you before you even
got up this morning.

293
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:08,465
- How you been, Saul?
- Never better.

294
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,592
What's with the orange?

295
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,388
- My doctor says I need vitamins.
- Why don't you take vitamins?

296
00:24:15,764 --> 00:24:18,224
You come here to give me a physical?

297
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:20,643
Box seats. Come on.

298
00:24:33,323 --> 00:24:37,786
You gonna tell me? Or should I
say no and get it over with?

299
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:41,581
You're the best. You're in
Cooperstown. What do you want?

300
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,501
Nothing. I got a duplex now.

301
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:47,504
I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish.

302
00:24:47,712 --> 00:24:51,466
I'm seeing a lady who works
the counter at Macy's.

303
00:24:51,674 --> 00:24:53,635
I've changed.

304
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:01,810
Guys like us don't change.
We stay sharp or get sloppy.

305
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,020
Quit conning me.

306
00:25:04,312 --> 00:25:06,648
That your hound way in the rear?

307
00:25:06,898 --> 00:25:09,692
He breaks late.
Everyone knows this.

308
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,616
You going to treat me
like a grownup at least?

309
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:19,119
Tell me what the scam is?

310
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:52,652
<i>Exhibit C: His belt as king
of the heavyweight crown.</i>

311
00:25:53,194 --> 00:25:57,031
<i>Lennox Lewis has proven
he's the champion.</i>

312
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:02,412
Saul makes 10.
Ten should do it, don't you think?

313
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,582
You think we need one more?

314
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,544
You think we need one more.

315
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:12,881
All right, we'll get one more.

316
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:34,170
Hello, Linus. Whose is this?

317
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:38,675
- Who are you?
- A friend of Bobby Caldwell's.

318
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:43,346
You're either in or out.
Right now.

319
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:50,395
- What is it?
- It's a plane ticket. A job offer.

320
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:55,358
- You're pretty trusting.
- Bobby has faith in you.

321
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:57,902
Fathers are like that.

322
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:02,073
He didn't tell you? He doesn't
want me trading on his name.

323
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:05,160
Do this job,
he'll be trading on yours.

324
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:08,913
Don't, and you can go back
to feeling up stockbrokers.

325
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:11,499
Can you get the check, please?

326
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:16,921
That's the best lift you've made yet.

327
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:19,007
Las Vegas?

328
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:20,925
America's playground.

329
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:10,058
Did you guys get a group rate,
or something?

330
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:18,858
Saul, do you get out to Utah much?

331
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:22,779
Not as often as I'd like.

332
00:29:23,113 --> 00:29:27,992
Check it out. I think you'd dig Provo.
You could do well there.

333
00:29:28,284 --> 00:29:30,120
I'll look into it.

334
00:29:31,121 --> 00:29:35,750
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Has everybody eaten? Good.

335
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:38,002
Everybody sober?

336
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:43,049
Close enough. Before we start,
nobody's on the line yet.

337
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:47,887
What I'm about to propose is highly
lucrative and highly dangerous.

338
00:29:48,096 --> 00:29:50,849
If that's not your brand of vodka...

339
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:55,812
...eat as much as you like and have
a safe journey. No hard feelings.

340
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,772
Otherwise, come with me.

341
00:30:07,198 --> 00:30:09,325
You're Bobby Caldwell's kid?

342
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:13,746
- From Chicago?
- Yeah.

343
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:17,292
- You like it there?
- Yeah.

344
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,546
That's wonderful.
Get in the goddamn house.

345
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:34,184
The 3000 block
of Las Vegas Boulevard...

346
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,937
...also known as the Bellagio,
Mirage and MGM Grand.

347
00:30:38,188 --> 00:30:42,358
They're three of the most
profitable casinos in Las Vegas.

348
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:47,572
This is the Bellagio vault, located...

349
00:30:47,822 --> 00:30:50,533
...beneath 200 feet of solid earth.

350
00:30:50,742 --> 00:30:55,830
It safeguards every dime that passes
through each of the three casinos.

351
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,125
- We're gonna rob it.
- Smash-and-grab job?

352
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,795
Slightly more complicated than that.

353
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:04,130
Well, yeah.

354
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:09,969
This is courtesy of Frank Catton,
a new dealer at the Bellagio.

355
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:11,638
Bad news first.

356
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:16,184
This place houses a security system
rivaling most nuclear silos.

357
00:31:16,392 --> 00:31:21,481
First, we have to get in the casino
cages, which takes more than a smile.

358
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:24,192
Next, through these doors...

359
00:31:24,442 --> 00:31:28,863
...each one requiring a different
code changed every 12 hours.

360
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:32,784
Past those, the elevator.
Here's where it gets tricky.

361
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:37,664
- It won't move without fingerprint I.D.
- Which we can't fake.

362
00:31:37,914 --> 00:31:42,877
And vocal confirmation from the system
within the Bellagio and the vault.

363
00:31:43,128 --> 00:31:44,629
Which we won't get.

364
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:47,882
The elevator shaft is rigged
with sensors.

365
00:31:48,091 --> 00:31:52,929
If we override the lift, the exit
would lock and we'd be trapped.

366
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:56,558
Once we get down the shaft,
it's a piece of cake.

367
00:31:56,808 --> 00:32:00,145
Just two more guards with Uzis...

368
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:04,149
...and the most elaborate
vault door ever conceived.

369
00:32:04,774 --> 00:32:06,443
Any questions?

370
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,114
Tunneling's out. There are...

371
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:16,202
...sensors monitoring the ground.
If a groundhog nested, they'd know.

372
00:32:16,786 --> 00:32:19,706
- Anyone else?
- You mentioned good news?

373
00:32:19,914 --> 00:32:23,293
Yeah. The Nevada Gaming
Commission requires...

374
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:28,089
...a casino to keep enough cash
to cover every chip on the floor.

375
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:32,135
That means on a weekday, by law,
it must carry...

376
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:35,221
...between $60 and $ 70 million
in cash and coin.

377
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,601
On the weekend, between 80 and 90
million. On a fight night...

378
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:42,896
...in two weeks,
the night we're robbing it...

379
00:32:43,104 --> 00:32:46,483
...$ 150 million,
without breaking a sweat.

380
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:50,737
There are 11 of us,
each with an equal share.

381
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:52,572
You do the math.

382
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:54,240
Exactly.

383
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:55,825
I have a question.

384
00:32:56,367 --> 00:33:00,455
Say we get into the cage
and through the security doors...

385
00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:03,041
...down the elevator
we can't move...

386
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:07,420
...past the guards with the guns,
into the vault we can't open...

387
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:12,258
- Without being seen by cameras.
- Sorry, I forgot to mention that.

388
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,178
Yeah, well, say we do all that...

389
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:20,058
...we're just supposed to walk out
of there with $ 150 million...

390
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:22,811
...without getting stopped?

391
00:33:27,774 --> 00:33:29,109
Yeah.

392
00:33:31,402 --> 00:33:34,531
Oh. Okay.

393
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:45,708
<i>First task: Reconnaissance.
I want to know what goes on...</i>

394
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:48,795
<i>... in all casinos,
from the dealers ' rotation...</i>

395
00:33:49,003 --> 00:33:55,051
<i>... to the path of cash carts. I want
to know everything about every guard.</i>

396
00:33:56,428 --> 00:34:01,474
<i>Find out where they're from,
nicknames, how they take their coffee.</i>

397
00:34:01,766 --> 00:34:04,894
She dances at Crazy Horse Too,
to pay for school.

398
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:08,356
- I think she really likes me.
- Cool.

399
00:34:13,736 --> 00:34:17,490
<i>Know these casinos.
They were built to keep people in.</i>

400
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,492
<i>Know the quick routes out.</i>

401
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:23,288
- He went through at 10:44.
- 10:46. Get a watch that works.

402
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:27,041
- You make me sick, dude. It's 10:44.
- 10:46.

403
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:33,673
<i>Second task: Power.</i>

404
00:34:34,215 --> 00:34:38,720
<i>Fight night, we throw the switch
on Sin City. It's Basher's show.</i>

405
00:34:38,928 --> 00:34:41,765
<i>You want broke, blind or bedlam?</i>

406
00:34:41,973 --> 00:34:45,351
<i>- How about all three?
- Right, it's done.</i>

407
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,563
<i>Third task: Surveillance.</i>

408
00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:51,816
<i>Security has an eye
and an ear on everything.</i>

409
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:54,527
<i>We want an eye and ear on them.
Livingston?</i>

410
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:58,364
Not the least accessible system
I've seen, but close.

411
00:34:58,573 --> 00:35:01,951
- There's no closed-circuit I can tap?
- No.

412
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,415
Then it's definitely a black bag job.
They employ an in-house technician?

413
00:35:07,624 --> 00:35:10,376
Two. And one of them is lonely.

414
00:35:24,808 --> 00:35:27,977
Thanks, Charmaine.
I'll return it in an hour.

415
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:32,524
- Say hi to your mom for me.
- Say it yourself. She's on-stage soon.

416
00:35:55,922 --> 00:35:56,923
Watch it, bud!

417
00:35:57,132 --> 00:36:00,051
- You call me bud, pal?
- You call me pal, friend?

418
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,222
- You call me friend, jackass?
- Don't call me jackass.

419
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:09,769
433, we have a visual impairment
on the northwest 052 exit-door camera.

420
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,814
Copy that. I see them.

421
00:36:41,134 --> 00:36:46,222
- Is that a word? You made that up?
- "Obsequious" is a word.

422
00:36:56,941 --> 00:37:00,111
- Please move your balloons.
- You got in my way!

423
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,656
- I was trying to deliver my balloons!
- Gentlemen!

424
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:08,995
- He's a balloon boy! Balloon boy!
- You're spitting in my face.

425
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:29,682
And we're up and running.

426
00:37:30,391 --> 00:37:35,980
- Why are hallways always that color?
- They say taupe is very soothing.

427
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:41,277
- Hi.
- Fine, thanks.

428
00:37:52,914 --> 00:37:55,041
- Move the balloons.
- Move them?

429
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,293
I have a client waiting for these.

430
00:37:57,502 --> 00:38:03,049
I don't have time to fool around
with you circus animals.

431
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,960
Hey! Hold up a minute!

432
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:41,379
Excuse me!

433
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:44,591
Hey! Excuse me!

434
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:50,263
- Hey, you dropped this.
- Oh, thank you.

435
00:38:50,472 --> 00:38:53,808
- How's the reception on those things?
- Excellent.

436
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,437
- Take care.
- Thanks.

437
00:39:03,777 --> 00:39:06,404
- Well...
- Yeah.

438
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:10,158
<i>Fourth task: Construction.</i>

439
00:39:10,408 --> 00:39:13,912
<i>We need to build an exact
replica of the Bellagio vault.</i>

440
00:39:14,078 --> 00:39:17,624
<i>- To practice?
- Something like that.</i>

441
00:39:18,124 --> 00:39:19,834
<i>Fifth task: Intelligence.</i>

442
00:39:20,043 --> 00:39:24,047
We need those codes, Linus,
from the guy who has all three.

443
00:39:24,255 --> 00:39:27,592
- Who, Benedict?
- Learn to love his shadow.

444
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:32,514
- All I get to do is watch the guy?
- Gotta walk before you crawl.

445
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:36,351
- Reverse that.
- Sixth task: Transport.

446
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,693
Well, I am sorry, but $ 18,500 a piece
is the best offer that I can make.

447
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:48,655
Well, I understand.

448
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,827
- They are some great-looking vans.
- Yes, sir, top of the line.

449
00:39:54,869 --> 00:40:00,250
- Okay. Thank you for your time, Mr...?
- Denham. Billy Tim Denham.

450
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:05,505
- Denham like a jean.
- That's it. Just like the jean.

451
00:40:06,714 --> 00:40:10,677
Man, you got some lovely hands here.
Do you moisturize?

452
00:40:10,885 --> 00:40:13,388
- I'm sorry?
- I've tried lots of lotion.

453
00:40:13,596 --> 00:40:17,308
I even went fragrance-free
for a year. Now my sister...

454
00:40:17,517 --> 00:40:22,272
...she uses aloe vera
with a little sunscreen in it.

455
00:40:23,565 --> 00:40:26,943
Ideally, we all should
wear gloves to bed...

456
00:40:27,152 --> 00:40:33,158
...but I found there was interference
with my social agenda, you know.

457
00:40:33,575 --> 00:40:39,038
Plus, I react to the camphor. So
I'm not into the traditional remedies.

458
00:40:39,247 --> 00:40:42,751
Let me tell you something.
If you could pay cash...

459
00:40:43,042 --> 00:40:45,211
...I could drop that
down to seven...

460
00:40:45,545 --> 00:40:47,422
Sixteen each.

461
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:49,674
- No?
- Yes, sir.

462
00:40:49,883 --> 00:40:51,593
- You'd do that?
- Yes, sir.

463
00:40:51,926 --> 00:40:54,387
That'd be lovely.
They told me to see you.

464
00:40:54,846 --> 00:40:58,016
- Well, I'm glad they did.
- They told me.

465
00:40:58,224 --> 00:41:03,688
Well, let me go get the paperwork.
You just wait here at the table.

466
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:05,482
- You do that.
- Thank you.

467
00:41:13,448 --> 00:41:17,619
- Very nice material.
- It's imported silk, Saul.

468
00:41:18,411 --> 00:41:21,039
It's very nice.

469
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:26,377
Gentlemen, would you
excuse us for a second?

470
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:38,389
Saul, you sure you're ready
to do this?

471
00:41:41,643 --> 00:41:45,438
If you ever ask me
that question again, Daniel...

472
00:41:45,647 --> 00:41:48,483
...you won't wake up
the following morning.

473
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:55,031
He's ready.

474
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,956
My name is Lyman.
Zerga.

475
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,960
<i>My name is Lyman Zerga.</i>

476
00:42:08,628 --> 00:42:12,173
<i>My name is Lyman Zerga.</i>

477
00:42:34,904 --> 00:42:37,323
Okay, tell me about Benedict.

478
00:42:37,532 --> 00:42:38,992
That guy's a machine.

479
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,452
Good afternoon.

480
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,330
<i>He arrives at the Bellagio
every day at 2 p.m.</i>

481
00:42:44,664 --> 00:42:46,124
How are you, Tommy?

482
00:42:46,332 --> 00:42:48,376
<i>He remembers every valet's name.</i>

483
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:51,963
<i>Not bad for a guy
worth 3/4 of a billion.</i>

484
00:42:52,172 --> 00:42:55,884
<i>He works hard, hits
the lobby floor at 7 on the nose.</i>

485
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:58,178
- Good evening, sir.
- How are you?

486
00:42:58,386 --> 00:43:01,598
<i>- Talks with his casino manager.
- About what?</i>

487
00:43:01,806 --> 00:43:02,807
<i>All business.</i>

488
00:43:03,183 --> 00:43:06,728
<i>Benedict likes to know
what's going on. Be in control.</i>

489
00:43:06,936 --> 00:43:12,025
<i>There's rarely an incident he doesn 't
know about or handle personally.</i>

490
00:43:13,526 --> 00:43:17,197
<i>Spends a few minutes
glad-handing the high rollers.</i>

491
00:43:18,907 --> 00:43:23,870
<i>He speaks Spanish, German and Italian
and is getting good at Japanese.</i>

492
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:29,250
<i>He's out by 7:30
and is handed a black portfolio.</i>

493
00:43:29,584 --> 00:43:34,714
<i>Contents: Profits and new security
codes. He heads to the restaurant.</i>

494
00:43:40,762 --> 00:43:42,931
Like I said, a machine.

495
00:43:43,223 --> 00:43:46,726
That portfolio contains
codes to all the cage doors?

496
00:43:46,935 --> 00:43:50,563
And two minutes after they're changed,
he's got them.

497
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:56,903
You guys really can pick them.
This guy's as smart as he is ruthless.

498
00:43:57,153 --> 00:44:01,491
Last guy he caught cheating,
he not only sent up for 10 years...

499
00:44:01,699 --> 00:44:04,577
...he seized his house
and bankrupted his...

500
00:44:04,786 --> 00:44:06,246
In-law's dealership.

501
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:11,084
He takes out your knees and ruins
your life and anybody you know.

502
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:12,710
You scared?

503
00:44:13,044 --> 00:44:14,712
You suicidal?

504
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:18,133
Only in the morning.

505
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,802
- Now what?
- Now comes the girl.

506
00:44:21,886 --> 00:44:25,014
She comes down after him
if they're in a snit.

507
00:44:25,223 --> 00:44:29,769
- Where does she come from?
- The museum, there. She's the curator.

508
00:44:31,646 --> 00:44:33,106
Here she is.

509
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:37,444
This is the best part of my day.

510
00:44:50,957 --> 00:44:55,462
I'm not sure we can use her yet.
I haven't even caught her name.

511
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,464
Tess.

512
00:44:57,714 --> 00:44:59,591
Huh?

513
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:01,468
Her name is Tess.

514
00:45:24,491 --> 00:45:26,868
- We have to talk. Now.
- Okay.

515
00:45:31,331 --> 00:45:35,001
Tell me this is not about her
or I walk off the job.

516
00:45:35,376 --> 00:45:36,836
Who?

517
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,964
Tess. Benedict.
Tell me this isn't about...

518
00:45:40,173 --> 00:45:43,218
...the guy who's screwing your wife.
- Ex-wife.

519
00:45:43,426 --> 00:45:45,845
- Tell me.
- It's not about that.

520
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:53,353
It's not entirely about that.
Remember when we got in this business?

521
00:45:53,561 --> 00:45:56,856
We said we'd play
like we had nothing to lose.

522
00:45:57,065 --> 00:45:58,858
Well, I lost something.

523
00:45:59,734 --> 00:46:03,738
I lost someone.
That's why I'm here.

524
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:11,830
The problem is,
now we're stealing two things.

525
00:46:12,038 --> 00:46:16,334
And if you can't have both,
which do you choose?

526
00:46:16,543 --> 00:46:19,379
Remember, Tess does not split 11 ways.

527
00:46:19,712 --> 00:46:25,385
If everything goes to plan, I won't be
the one that has to make that choice.

528
00:46:30,056 --> 00:46:32,559
- How did she look?
- She looked good.

529
00:46:32,767 --> 00:46:34,060
Thanks.

530
00:47:05,592 --> 00:47:06,968
You like it?

531
00:47:09,053 --> 00:47:11,598
I like that you like it.

532
00:47:14,726 --> 00:47:16,770
- I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

533
00:47:24,152 --> 00:47:27,572
In my hotel, there's always
somebody watching.

534
00:47:29,032 --> 00:47:30,575
I'll see you tonight.

535
00:47:45,173 --> 00:47:47,300
Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?

536
00:47:48,134 --> 00:47:51,971
I don't believe in weakness.
It costs too much.

537
00:47:52,388 --> 00:47:54,933
I don't believe in questions either.

538
00:47:55,141 --> 00:47:58,353
Oh, really? Well then,
let me give you a tip.

539
00:47:58,645 --> 00:48:02,273
Don't get into Terry Benedict
for too much money.

540
00:48:02,565 --> 00:48:04,359
He doesn't fool around.

541
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:06,569
- How are you, Eddie?
- Fine, sir.

542
00:48:06,778 --> 00:48:08,113
Anything for me?

543
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:12,784
Mr. Lyman Zerga. Third position.
Wants to talk to you privately.

544
00:48:14,828 --> 00:48:16,121
Who is he?

545
00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:19,249
Businessman of some kind,
from Europe.

546
00:48:19,457 --> 00:48:23,837
Very vague. I asked around.
Word is, he deals primarily in arms.

547
00:48:24,212 --> 00:48:26,089
- One of the biggest.
- Zerga.

548
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:27,966
Yes, sir.

549
00:48:28,425 --> 00:48:31,970
- Never heard of him.
- That's why I don't doubt it.

550
00:48:32,178 --> 00:48:36,015
- He's staying here?
- He's in the Mirador suite.

551
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:40,019
- How's he doing?
- Up, almost 200.

552
00:48:41,521 --> 00:48:43,481
Good for him.

553
00:48:58,204 --> 00:49:02,917
You're 30 seconds late.
I was about to send out a search...

554
00:49:04,252 --> 00:49:05,920
Hello, Tess.

555
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,090
What are you doing here?

556
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,551
I'm out.

557
00:49:12,177 --> 00:49:13,470
- Out?
- Of prison.

558
00:49:13,678 --> 00:49:17,015
Remember? I went for cigarettes
and didn't come back.

559
00:49:17,265 --> 00:49:20,059
I don't smoke.
Don't sit.

560
00:49:20,602 --> 00:49:25,940
- They say I paid my debt to society.
- Funny, I never got a check.

561
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:28,568
You're not wearing your ring.

562
00:49:29,402 --> 00:49:33,031
I don't have a husband,
or didn't you get the papers?

563
00:49:33,656 --> 00:49:37,327
- My last day inside.
- I told you I'd write.

564
00:49:40,455 --> 00:49:45,460
- Danny, go now before...
- What? Benedict?

565
00:49:46,628 --> 00:49:49,631
How you doing?
Whiskey and whiskey.

566
00:49:51,049 --> 00:49:55,595
You're doing a great job at the museum.
The Vermeer is quite good.

567
00:49:55,845 --> 00:49:59,891
- Vibrant. But his work fell off later.
- Remind you of anyone?

568
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:05,105
I always confuse Monet and Manet.
Which one married his mistress?

569
00:50:05,438 --> 00:50:07,649
- Monet.
- And Manet had syphilis.

570
00:50:08,191 --> 00:50:10,652
They also painted occasionally.

571
00:50:14,447 --> 00:50:16,908
All right, I'll make this quick.

572
00:50:17,117 --> 00:50:18,993
I came here for you.

573
00:50:20,745 --> 00:50:24,249
I want to get on with my life.
I want you with me.

574
00:50:24,874 --> 00:50:26,709
You're a thief and a liar.

575
00:50:27,335 --> 00:50:30,547
I lied about being a thief.
I don't do that now.

576
00:50:30,755 --> 00:50:32,632
- Steal?
- Lie.

577
00:50:33,341 --> 00:50:35,844
Terry doesn't have to make
the distinction.

578
00:50:36,052 --> 00:50:39,180
He's clear on both.

579
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:41,808
- You have a problem.
- Only one?

580
00:50:42,016 --> 00:50:47,313
You've met too many people like you.
I'm with Terry now.

581
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,694
Does he make you laugh?

582
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,240
He doesn't make me cry.

583
00:51:09,502 --> 00:51:14,507
- The fight is Saturday night?
- Yes, would you like tickets?

584
00:51:14,716 --> 00:51:18,511
No. Hand-to-hand combat
does not interest me.

585
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,182
I have a package arriving
here that evening.

586
00:51:22,766 --> 00:51:25,310
A black briefcase, standard size...

587
00:51:25,894 --> 00:51:30,064
...the contents of which
is very valuable to me.

588
00:51:31,065 --> 00:51:33,193
I'll put it in the house safe.

589
00:51:33,401 --> 00:51:37,447
The house safe is for brandy
and grandmother's pearls.

590
00:51:38,531 --> 00:51:43,161
- I need something more secure.
- Mr. Zerga, I can assure you our...

591
00:51:43,411 --> 00:51:48,208
I can assure you, Mr. Benedict,
that your generosity in this matter...

592
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:51,294
...will not go overlooked.

593
00:51:51,503 --> 00:51:57,383
Now, what can you offer me
besides the safe?

594
00:51:58,093 --> 00:52:02,722
People you steal from have insurance.
They get made whole again.

595
00:52:03,056 --> 00:52:07,811
I had to leave New York to escape.
How do I get my five years back?

596
00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:12,232
- What you can do is not throw...
- You don't know anything.

597
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,193
You don't love me,
you want someone else.

598
00:52:15,401 --> 00:52:21,407
- I must live with that. But not him.
- Spoken like a true ex-husband.

599
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:24,410
- I'm not joking.
- I'm not laughing.

600
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:28,581
There's a conflict of interest
when you give me love advice.

601
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:32,919
Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong.

602
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:38,341
Do you remember what I said
when we first met?

603
00:52:39,092 --> 00:52:43,763
- That I better know what I'm doing.
- Do you? Now?

604
00:52:44,597 --> 00:52:46,266
You should go if you don't.

605
00:52:46,683 --> 00:52:49,769
- I know what I'm doing.
- What are you doing?

606
00:52:51,479 --> 00:52:53,148
Just catching up.

607
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:55,817
- Meet my ex-husband.
- Danny Ocean.

608
00:52:56,025 --> 00:52:58,653
- Mr. Ocean.
- I'm in your seat.

609
00:52:59,279 --> 00:53:02,740
Forgive my lateness.
A guest required my attention.

610
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:07,245
That's fine. Danny was walking
through and spotted me.

611
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:09,539
- Is that so?
- Imagine the odds.

612
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:12,584
Of all the gin joints
in all the world.

613
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:15,420
You recently were
released from prison?

614
00:53:15,628 --> 00:53:16,629
That's right.

615
00:53:16,838 --> 00:53:19,966
- How does it feel to be out?
- About the same.

616
00:53:21,134 --> 00:53:25,805
- Danny was just about to...
- I just stopped by to say hi to Tess.

617
00:53:26,014 --> 00:53:27,265
Stay, have a drink.

618
00:53:27,515 --> 00:53:29,142
- I can't.
- He can't.

619
00:53:33,229 --> 00:53:35,148
Well, then...

620
00:53:36,274 --> 00:53:39,444
I imagine we won't see
Mr. Ocean anytime soon.

621
00:53:39,652 --> 00:53:41,154
You never know.

622
00:53:41,362 --> 00:53:44,324
I know everything
happening in my hotels.

623
00:53:44,657 --> 00:53:47,327
So I should put
those towels back.

624
00:53:47,535 --> 00:53:49,996
No, the towels you can keep.

625
00:53:55,251 --> 00:53:58,004
- Good to see you, Tess.
- Take care, Danny.

626
00:53:58,213 --> 00:54:00,340
- Terry.
- Danny.

627
00:55:26,176 --> 00:55:27,343
Stinking...

628
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:29,012
<i>Tomorrow the day is yours.</i>

629
00:55:30,805 --> 00:55:33,725
Call is at 5:30, makeup and costume.

630
00:55:33,933 --> 00:55:37,771
Saul's package arrives at 7:05.
Linus grabs our codes.

631
00:55:38,146 --> 00:55:43,151
All goes well, we're a go. At 7:30,
Yen is locked in and we're committed.

632
00:55:43,485 --> 00:55:48,615
From this point, we have 30 minutes
to blow the power or he suffocates.

633
00:56:02,462 --> 00:56:06,174
<i>Once the electricity goes,
access to the vault...</i>

634
00:56:06,382 --> 00:56:11,137
<i>... and its elevator shut down
for two minutes. That's when we go.</i>

635
00:56:15,141 --> 00:56:19,229
You're in the middle of the room,
10 feet from everything.

636
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:23,316
You have to get to the door
without touching the floor.

637
00:56:23,817 --> 00:56:25,151
What do you do?

638
00:56:25,652 --> 00:56:28,655
- Ten says he shorts it.
- Twenty.

639
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:38,373
Window or aisle, boys?

640
00:56:39,707 --> 00:56:41,835
Yeah, we're in deep shit.

641
00:56:42,168 --> 00:56:45,839
That poxy demo crew
didn't back the main line.

642
00:56:46,172 --> 00:56:49,217
They naused up the mainframe.
Naused it up!

643
00:56:49,968 --> 00:56:52,595
- You understand him?
- I'll explain later.

644
00:56:53,012 --> 00:56:57,142
They're so pony they blew
the backup grids one by one.

645
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:58,935
Basher, what happened?

646
00:56:59,561 --> 00:57:02,814
<i>They did what I would have done
but by accident.</i>

647
00:57:03,022 --> 00:57:06,651
<i>Now they know their weakness,
they're fixing it.</i>

648
00:57:07,277 --> 00:57:11,781
So unless we intend to do this job
in Reno, we're in Barney.

649
00:57:14,242 --> 00:57:16,953
Barney Rubble.
Trouble!

650
00:57:20,081 --> 00:57:22,625
- We could always...
- By tomorrow?

651
00:57:23,585 --> 00:57:27,213
Hang on a minute, hang on.
We could use a pinch.

652
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:31,801
What's a pinch?

653
00:57:32,385 --> 00:57:36,890
A device which creates a cardiac
arrest for broadband circuitry.

654
00:57:37,098 --> 00:57:40,643
Better yet, a pinch is
a bomb without the bomb.

655
00:57:40,894 --> 00:57:44,981
When a nuclear weapon detonates,
its electromagnetic pulse...

656
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:48,401
...shuts down any power source
within its blast radius.

657
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:53,615
It usually doesn't matter because
a nuclear weapon destroys everything.

658
00:57:53,907 --> 00:57:57,368
A pinch creates a similar
electromagnetic pulse...

659
00:57:57,619 --> 00:58:01,956
...without mass destruction and death.
Instead of Hiroshima you get...

660
00:58:02,165 --> 00:58:04,584
...the 17th century.
- How long?

661
00:58:04,793 --> 00:58:05,877
30 seconds.

662
00:58:06,336 --> 00:58:11,049
Could a pinch knock out
the power of an entire city?

663
00:58:11,257 --> 00:58:14,302
- Like, for instance...
- Las Vegas?

664
00:58:16,513 --> 00:58:18,139
Yeah, I think it might.

665
00:58:18,681 --> 00:58:21,893
There's only one pinch
big enough to do it.

666
00:58:22,102 --> 00:58:23,269
Where?

667
00:58:36,491 --> 00:58:38,785
Let's go.
Yen, Basher, come on.

668
00:58:39,327 --> 00:58:40,620
Where you going?

669
00:58:40,954 --> 00:58:42,580
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

670
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:46,126
Oh, no, no, no!
Don't leave me with these guys!

671
00:58:55,552 --> 00:58:56,553
Start.

672
00:58:56,761 --> 00:58:58,972
- I got one.
- You thinking of one?

673
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:02,600
- No, I've thought of one.
- You're thinking of one.

674
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:04,894
No, I'm done. I have it.

675
00:59:05,103 --> 00:59:06,604
- You a man?
- Yes. 19.

676
00:59:06,813 --> 00:59:08,231
- You alive?
- Yes. 18.

677
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:10,900
- Evel Knievel.
- Shit!

678
00:59:11,151 --> 00:59:12,819
- Don't touch me.
- I'm not.

679
00:59:13,027 --> 00:59:15,613
- Your hand's in my face.
- It's not.

680
00:59:15,864 --> 00:59:18,741
- Am I touching you?
- Your hand's in my face.

681
00:59:18,992 --> 00:59:20,744
- Move.
- I didn't touch you.

682
00:59:20,994 --> 00:59:24,038
- You just touched me.
- You made me touch you.

683
00:59:24,289 --> 00:59:26,916
This is your side.
This is your side.

684
00:59:28,209 --> 00:59:30,253
Get off. Get off.

685
00:59:58,281 --> 01:00:01,076
I'm gonna need a score
of car batteries...

686
01:00:01,284 --> 01:00:04,579
Where's Linus?
Where's Linus?!

687
01:00:13,129 --> 01:00:16,633
- There he is.
- Oh, would you look at this doughnut?

688
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:30,188
Should someone help him?

689
01:00:30,396 --> 01:00:34,526
That's a great idea, Albert.
Let's all get nicked.

690
01:00:39,823 --> 01:00:41,074
Back it up.

691
01:00:58,216 --> 01:00:59,676
Let him in.

692
01:01:07,183 --> 01:01:09,561
You stupid bastard!

693
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:17,277
- I say stay, you stay.
- Got it.

694
01:01:17,485 --> 01:01:20,697
Lose focus for one second,
somebody gets hurt!

695
01:01:20,947 --> 01:01:22,323
I got it.

696
01:01:26,703 --> 01:01:28,455
Where are they?

697
01:01:29,122 --> 01:01:32,625
That's what I want to know.
Where the hell are they?

698
01:01:32,834 --> 01:01:36,671
- They will be here.
- "They will be here." Schmuck!

699
01:01:44,304 --> 01:01:46,306
<i>You boys have a nice trip?</i>

700
01:01:57,317 --> 01:01:58,860
We have a problem.

701
01:01:59,903 --> 01:02:01,821
You've been red-flagged.

702
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:05,867
The moment you enter the casino,
they'll be watching.

703
01:02:06,076 --> 01:02:10,163
Like hawks.
Hawks with video cameras.

704
01:02:11,998 --> 01:02:13,792
That's a problem.

705
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,753
- Saul, turn that off.
- When I'm ready...

706
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:20,381
- Saul!
- It's off! It's off!

707
01:02:22,842 --> 01:02:25,053
Any idea how this happened?

708
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:27,972
- No.
- Oh, come on.

709
01:02:28,181 --> 01:02:33,061
He's been chasing Benedict's girl.
They had an argument two nights ago.

710
01:02:34,229 --> 01:02:36,314
- I tailed you.
- Who told you to?

711
01:02:36,523 --> 01:02:39,651
I did. I worried you couldn't
leave Tess alone.

712
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:41,111
- Tess?
- My wife.

713
01:02:41,361 --> 01:02:43,822
- Ex-wife.
- Tess is here?

714
01:02:45,198 --> 01:02:49,577
I'm sorry. I didn't know if it
would sting you, but it did.

715
01:02:49,786 --> 01:02:51,830
- You're out, Danny.
- He's out?

716
01:02:52,038 --> 01:02:55,625
Or we call it off.
His involvement puts us at risk.

717
01:02:55,875 --> 01:03:00,004
- It's not your call.
- You put her before us and made it mine.

718
01:03:00,213 --> 01:03:02,090
This is my job.

719
01:03:02,507 --> 01:03:03,508
Not anymore.

720
01:03:03,716 --> 01:03:07,220
He can't just be out.
Who's gonna trigger the vault?

721
01:03:07,429 --> 01:03:09,222
Kid, you up for it?

722
01:03:14,936 --> 01:03:16,354
I can do it.

723
01:03:16,729 --> 01:03:20,358
Done. Locate the others.
Tell them the change in plan.

724
01:03:20,567 --> 01:03:22,235
Curtain goes up at 7.

725
01:03:22,444 --> 01:03:27,449
Tess is with Benedict now?
She's too tall for him.

726
01:03:28,867 --> 01:03:31,244
Yes. No.

727
01:03:32,704 --> 01:03:34,456
Very much no.

728
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:42,422
Then inform Mr. Levin he'll be better
off watching the fight at home on TV.

729
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:46,509
Surely, he must have HBO.
That's it.

730
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:52,265
Hi.

731
01:03:55,226 --> 01:03:57,896
What were you thinking about?

732
01:03:58,396 --> 01:04:00,231
You.

733
01:04:02,942 --> 01:04:05,069
<i>Where you gonna put your hands?</i>

734
01:04:07,781 --> 01:04:09,157
No good.

735
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,411
Don't touch your tie. Look at me.

736
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:17,123
You need to answer my question.
Where do you look?

737
01:04:17,332 --> 01:04:22,337
No. Look down, they know you're lying.
Up, and you don't know the truth.

738
01:04:22,545 --> 01:04:25,298
Don't use seven words if four will do.

739
01:04:25,548 --> 01:04:30,929
Be specific, but not memorable.
Be funny, but don't make him laugh.

740
01:04:31,137 --> 01:04:34,933
He's got to like you,
then forget you once you leave.

741
01:04:35,141 --> 01:04:38,269
And, for God's sake,
whatever you do, don't...

742
01:04:38,478 --> 01:04:40,730
Russ! Can you take a look at this?

743
01:04:40,939 --> 01:04:42,357
Sure.

744
01:04:58,915 --> 01:05:00,375
Saul?

745
01:05:05,588 --> 01:05:07,048
It's time.

746
01:05:25,483 --> 01:05:26,901
Okay.

747
01:05:27,318 --> 01:05:28,820
Let's do it.

748
01:05:32,073 --> 01:05:34,909
<i>On a perfectly clear night
in Las Vegas...</i>

749
01:05:35,118 --> 01:05:39,164
<i>... with the expected crowd
of celebrities and sports fans...</i>

750
01:05:39,372 --> 01:05:44,335
<i>... piling into the MGM Grand, the two
best heavyweights in the world...</i>

751
01:05:44,544 --> 01:05:50,508
<i>... prepare to meet after an eight-month
dance toward each other.</i>

752
01:05:53,052 --> 01:05:54,387
Mr. Zerga?

753
01:05:54,888 --> 01:05:56,556
Mr. Benedict.

754
01:05:56,806 --> 01:06:02,061
- I'm very busy. Are we on schedule?
- I have no reason to suspect otherwise.

755
01:06:02,604 --> 01:06:06,399
<i>My courier should be here momentarily.</i>

756
01:06:27,087 --> 01:06:30,715
Eighteen.
Blackjack!

757
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:48,525
Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean
is in the west slots.

758
01:06:50,276 --> 01:06:54,697
I can't have private security
personnel in the casino cages.

759
01:06:54,906 --> 01:06:56,241
Of course not.

760
01:06:57,742 --> 01:07:00,745
Saul!
Saul Bloom, is that you?

761
01:07:00,995 --> 01:07:04,249
Saul! Saul, it's me!
Bucky Buchanan!

762
01:07:04,457 --> 01:07:06,793
Remember?
From Saratoga!

763
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:12,382
Mikael. Vladimir.

764
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:16,177
Hey! Hey, Saul!

765
01:07:18,263 --> 01:07:19,764
Mr. Benedict, please.

766
01:07:19,973 --> 01:07:24,310
I have never enjoyed the touch
of steel to my skin.

767
01:07:31,484 --> 01:07:33,361
Lift them up, please.

768
01:07:41,745 --> 01:07:46,583
I acknowledge your briefcase contains
nothing dangerous or illicit.

769
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:50,670
I agree to take said briefcase
and store it in my vault...

770
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,839
...for a period of 24 hours.

771
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:56,718
- I cannot allow you into the vault.
- Why not?

772
01:07:56,926 --> 01:08:02,474
Insurance, for one. Security.
Most of all, I just don't trust you.

773
01:08:03,808 --> 01:08:05,977
Excuse me.

774
01:08:09,397 --> 01:08:13,818
I put two plainclothes on Ocean.
He's in the keno bar now.

775
01:08:14,027 --> 01:08:17,864
Mr. Zerga, this is my
casino manager, Mr. Walsh.

776
01:08:18,073 --> 01:08:22,452
He will have your briefcase stored
in our vault while you watch.

777
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:25,080
Those are my terms.
Yes or no?

778
01:08:25,872 --> 01:08:29,250
You leave me no choice.

779
01:08:32,796 --> 01:08:35,548
Dude, don't do that
in front of the pinch.

780
01:09:20,218 --> 01:09:23,430
<i>Deep breaths.
You'll do fine.</i>

781
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,224
<i>- Thank you.
- No sweat. You're a natural.</i>

782
01:09:26,433 --> 01:09:28,643
<i>But don 't screw up.</i>

783
01:09:35,817 --> 01:09:38,736
- Who gets the penne?
- Right here.

784
01:09:44,701 --> 01:09:45,952
You ready?

785
01:09:48,204 --> 01:09:52,751
This is our security center,
where we oversee the casino and vault.

786
01:09:53,001 --> 01:09:55,712
You'll monitor your briefcase
from here.

787
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,464
Don't let me keep you.

788
01:09:57,672 --> 01:10:00,508
- Mr. Zerga.
- Mr. Benedict.

789
01:10:06,556 --> 01:10:08,183
Linus, you're up.

790
01:10:09,559 --> 01:10:10,727
Got him.

791
01:10:11,102 --> 01:10:12,562
Mr. Benedict.

792
01:10:13,354 --> 01:10:16,274
Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

793
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:19,027
I need two minutes of your time.

794
01:10:20,278 --> 01:10:22,280
- Anything for the NGC.
- Thanks.

795
01:10:22,489 --> 01:10:25,325
Will you accompany me
to pit five, please?

796
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:47,138
<i>- You make the deposit when?
- At your signal.</i>

797
01:10:47,347 --> 01:10:51,351
What do we look like,
a couple of peckerwood jackasses?

798
01:10:52,769 --> 01:10:54,979
How does that feel?
You all right?

799
01:10:55,188 --> 01:10:57,982
Want something to read?
A magazine?

800
01:10:58,191 --> 01:11:00,193
All right.
Counting down.

801
01:11:00,527 --> 01:11:03,905
Thirty minutes of
breathing time starts now.

802
01:11:04,531 --> 01:11:07,158
This just came to our attention today.

803
01:11:07,367 --> 01:11:10,537
Apparently, he's got
a record longer than my...

804
01:11:11,454 --> 01:11:13,039
It's long.

805
01:11:16,876 --> 01:11:19,212
If he is who you say he is.

806
01:11:24,384 --> 01:11:26,636
You been at the commission long?

807
01:11:27,262 --> 01:11:31,307
- About 18 months.
- You know Hal Lindley? Worked with him?

808
01:11:33,309 --> 01:11:35,728
Not since he died last year.

809
01:11:39,732 --> 01:11:44,195
Ramón Escalante? Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

810
01:11:44,446 --> 01:11:46,030
What's going on here?

811
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:50,869
- It's come to our attention...
- We should speak off the floor.

812
01:11:51,453 --> 01:11:53,496
Charlie.

813
01:12:15,018 --> 01:12:16,770
Thank you.

814
01:12:18,438 --> 01:12:21,775
- No. I want you out of here.
- Give me one moment.

815
01:12:22,025 --> 01:12:25,570
- I've had it. I want you gone.
- Tess, come here.

816
01:12:25,779 --> 01:12:27,489
You're up to something.

817
01:12:27,697 --> 01:12:31,826
Don't say you're here for me.
You're pulling a job, aren't you?

818
01:12:32,035 --> 01:12:35,413
Well, no matter what it is,
you won't win me back.

819
01:12:35,663 --> 01:12:38,291
Tess, I just came to say goodbye.

820
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:47,300
Goodbye.

821
01:13:01,147 --> 01:13:03,191
You be good.

822
01:13:13,493 --> 01:13:16,538
- Mr. Ocean.
- Mr. Benedict wishes to see you.

823
01:13:16,996 --> 01:13:18,748
I thought he might.

824
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,710
Good afternoon, Mr. Escalante.

825
01:13:22,877 --> 01:13:25,171
Or should I call you Mr. Catton?

826
01:13:26,506 --> 01:13:30,260
You're Frank Catton,
of the Tropicana, the Desert Inn...

827
01:13:30,468 --> 01:13:34,722
...and the New York state
penitentiary system. Are you not?

828
01:13:36,891 --> 01:13:40,645
I take it from your silence
you won't refute that.

829
01:13:41,104 --> 01:13:45,108
Mr. Benedict, you're employing
an ex-convict. As you know...

830
01:13:45,316 --> 01:13:47,485
Goddamn cracker.

831
01:13:49,654 --> 01:13:52,157
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

832
01:13:52,365 --> 01:13:55,201
Black man can't earn a decent wage?

833
01:13:55,452 --> 01:13:58,913
- You wanna throw me on the street.
- I'm doing my job.

834
01:13:59,122 --> 01:14:04,669
Want me to get on the table and dance?
Shine your shoes? Smile at you?

835
01:14:05,128 --> 01:14:10,425
You sure won't let me deal the cards.
You might as well call it whitejack!

836
01:14:12,802 --> 01:14:17,891
I don't know what to say to that.
Race has nothing to do with it.

837
01:14:18,099 --> 01:14:21,561
- Yeah, right.
- What a horrible thing to say!

838
01:14:23,104 --> 01:14:28,985
You, of all people, know the NGC has
always supported hiring colored...

839
01:14:29,527 --> 01:14:33,239
- No! I didn't mean it!
- Okay. Come on, sit down.

840
01:14:34,157 --> 01:14:36,409
- Sit down.
- You better talk to him.

841
01:14:37,077 --> 01:14:39,412
<i>- He's got it.
- Sit down.</i>

842
01:14:39,662 --> 01:14:42,415
Virgil. Turk.
Deliver the package.

843
01:14:54,636 --> 01:14:56,596
- Where's your card?
- I lost it.

844
01:14:56,805 --> 01:14:58,598
- You serious?
- I'm so stupid.

845
01:14:58,807 --> 01:15:01,518
- You are so stupid! You know that?
- Hey!

846
01:15:01,768 --> 01:15:05,563
You think it helps to call someone
names who's upset?

847
01:15:05,814 --> 01:15:09,484
- Hey! Keep it down.
- Sorry. Sorry.

848
01:15:09,692 --> 01:15:13,363
- Where did this come from?
- High roller's room.

849
01:15:13,571 --> 01:15:17,158
- It's Mr. Benedict's stuff.
- Joe, take this inside.

850
01:15:17,367 --> 01:15:21,079
- Count room?
- No, to the vault.

851
01:15:21,329 --> 01:15:23,748
Benedict's money goes in the vault.

852
01:15:23,957 --> 01:15:28,503
Next time, remember the card,
and we won't run into this again.

853
01:15:28,753 --> 01:15:30,839
- Stupid.
- Jeez!

854
01:15:37,637 --> 01:15:39,639
<i>Yo! Hold that, please.</i>

855
01:15:41,391 --> 01:15:46,438
- There's your briefcase now, Mr. Zerga.
- Wonderful.

856
01:15:52,318 --> 01:15:54,028
That's my cue.

857
01:15:55,029 --> 01:15:56,990
Give Basher the go.

858
01:15:57,991 --> 01:15:59,617
Bash, what's your status?

859
01:15:59,826 --> 01:16:03,371
<i>- Bash!
- Easy. No need to shout, guv'nor.</i>

860
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:06,916
<i>- What's your status?
- I'm nearly there.</i>

861
01:16:24,684 --> 01:16:26,352
Come on, come on.

862
01:16:27,395 --> 01:16:31,441
Mr. Walsh, show this man
off the premises.

863
01:16:31,775 --> 01:16:34,652
Don't ever set foot
in my casino again.

864
01:16:34,861 --> 01:16:36,112
Sir?

865
01:16:37,363 --> 01:16:39,449
- Cracker!
- Oh, dear God!

866
01:16:47,707 --> 01:16:52,295
Oh! I forgot my pager.
I left it. Sorry.

867
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,423
- Know the way back?
- I do.

868
01:16:55,632 --> 01:16:56,758
Good.

869
01:16:57,383 --> 01:16:59,260
Okay. Enjoy the fight.

870
01:17:00,428 --> 01:17:02,013
Sorry!

871
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:11,189
How much longer you figure
Mr. Benedict's gonna be?

872
01:17:20,907 --> 01:17:23,743
No cameras in this room, huh?

873
01:17:25,245 --> 01:17:26,704
Yeah.

874
01:17:28,164 --> 01:17:31,418
Don't want anybody seeing
what goes on in here.

875
01:17:34,129 --> 01:17:36,297
He's not coming, is he?

876
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:50,770
We're gonna step outside.
Leave you to talk things over.

877
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:57,777
I hadn't seen my wife in three weeks,
so I decided to call her.

878
01:17:57,986 --> 01:18:01,906
"I love you, you love me."
"I miss you, you miss me."

879
01:18:02,115 --> 01:18:05,410
That went well, but then
I went to this party...

880
01:18:09,664 --> 01:18:12,917
I show up at 1 p.m.
She expected me at 11 a. M...

881
01:18:13,126 --> 01:18:16,963
...so she was going crazy.
I said, "What do you expect?

882
01:18:17,172 --> 01:18:20,925
What do you think goes on?
It's not choir practice."

883
01:18:21,217 --> 01:18:22,886
Oh, shit.

884
01:18:26,097 --> 01:18:28,349
Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?

885
01:18:28,558 --> 01:18:32,187
I am very satisfied.

886
01:18:34,814 --> 01:18:39,819
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

887
01:18:41,821 --> 01:18:43,198
All right.

888
01:18:47,869 --> 01:18:49,329
Jesus!

889
01:18:50,747 --> 01:18:52,207
Bruiser!

890
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:56,836
- Not until later!
- Sorry, Danny. I forgot.

891
01:18:57,045 --> 01:18:58,630
It's all right.

892
01:19:00,381 --> 01:19:03,218
- How's your wife?
- Pregnant again.

893
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:07,764
Well, it happens.
Let's get started. Come here.

894
01:19:36,835 --> 01:19:40,255
- You're almost there, Linus.
- Who's that guy?

895
01:19:40,713 --> 01:19:43,716
- I got a bogey in west corridor.
- Mr. Zerga!

896
01:19:47,762 --> 01:19:51,558
- Call a doctor! Mr. Zerga!
- Put this under his head.

897
01:19:51,766 --> 01:19:54,686
Going to video now.

898
01:19:54,936 --> 01:19:57,230
- To the Eye in the Sky ASAP.

899
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,066
We have a man down
who's unconscious.

900
01:20:11,286 --> 01:20:12,912
Oh, Jesus!

901
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:18,543
- Did you really think I'd sit this out?
- You didn't trust me?

902
01:20:18,752 --> 01:20:20,253
I do now.

903
01:20:20,962 --> 01:20:22,422
Come on.

904
01:20:52,118 --> 01:20:54,329
Someone call for a doctor?

905
01:21:03,338 --> 01:21:07,258
- How'd you get here?
- Had to give a friend two million.

906
01:21:07,509 --> 01:21:12,263
But what about Rusty? The argument?
I mean, what was that about?

907
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:18,353
Come on. Why not just tell me?
Why put me through all this?

908
01:21:18,561 --> 01:21:21,815
Where's the fun in that?
Let's get going.

909
01:21:22,524 --> 01:21:25,360
Come on, man! Breathe!

910
01:21:25,735 --> 01:21:28,154
Breathe, damn it! Breathe!

911
01:21:33,993 --> 01:21:37,997
I'm sorry. We've lost him.

912
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:43,211
- Dude, I told you to hurry.
- Don't do that. Just don't.

913
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:45,338
I didn't tell you to hurry?

914
01:21:46,214 --> 01:21:49,050
Come on, get up! Get up!

915
01:21:54,431 --> 01:21:56,266
Had enough yet?

916
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:26,045
- These things will hold us, right?
- They should.

917
01:22:41,936 --> 01:22:43,855
Livingston, we're set.

918
01:22:44,564 --> 01:22:47,484
- Livingston, we're set.
- Basher, we're set.

919
01:22:48,401 --> 01:22:50,570
Hang on a minute, chief.

920
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,531
<i>We don 't have one.
Yen 's gonna suffocate.</i>

921
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:58,411
Well, then you better leave off
bothering me, don't you think?

922
01:23:54,717 --> 01:23:56,719
All right, crack them.

923
01:24:06,729 --> 01:24:08,231
Go.

924
01:24:14,821 --> 01:24:16,364
Shit!

925
01:24:17,282 --> 01:24:18,616
Cut it.

926
01:24:43,516 --> 01:24:44,851
Hey!

927
01:24:46,853 --> 01:24:49,814
Pit six, table five.
Dealers compromised.

928
01:24:50,023 --> 01:24:53,526
Trade's breached at tables three,
five, six and ten.

929
01:25:05,121 --> 01:25:07,874
Get your coat.
Get your coat.

930
01:25:08,541 --> 01:25:10,794
Look, this is crazy!
What...?

931
01:25:52,919 --> 01:25:54,838
Not yet.
Not yet.

932
01:26:00,218 --> 01:26:01,761
Go ahead.

933
01:26:03,888 --> 01:26:07,934
- You think Yen made it out okay?
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

934
01:26:09,269 --> 01:26:10,728
How we doing?

935
01:26:11,729 --> 01:26:14,524
Okay, I guess.

936
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:36,087
There's a 95-pound Chinese man
with $ 160 million behind this door.

937
01:26:36,296 --> 01:26:38,548
- Let's get him out.
- Yeah.

938
01:26:49,142 --> 01:26:51,478
- 10 cents he shorts it.
- No bet.

939
01:26:51,686 --> 01:26:53,396
Try him again.

940
01:27:25,053 --> 01:27:26,513
Okay.

941
01:27:33,686 --> 01:27:36,022
Hey.
Where we at, boys?

942
01:27:36,231 --> 01:27:40,276
- Pins and floor sensors, now.
- Blinding.

943
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:48,618
Here we go.

944
01:27:57,043 --> 01:28:00,213
Counting down from 20.
Now.

945
01:28:00,463 --> 01:28:01,840
Twenty.

946
01:28:04,676 --> 01:28:08,805
- Don't blow the door. Can you read me?
- Ten...

947
01:28:09,055 --> 01:28:10,974
...nine, eight...

948
01:28:11,182 --> 01:28:15,437
- Maybe the pinch blew out his earwigs.
- Do not blow the door!

949
01:28:17,564 --> 01:28:20,316
...two, one.

950
01:28:28,491 --> 01:28:29,743
What's wrong?

951
01:28:29,951 --> 01:28:31,453
Something...

952
01:28:44,132 --> 01:28:46,593
Did you check the batteries?

953
01:28:48,678 --> 01:28:52,098
You know, lose focus
in this game for one second...

954
01:28:52,307 --> 01:28:56,561
I know, somebody gets hurt.
You don't hear Yen complaining.

955
01:29:17,165 --> 01:29:18,666
Yen?

956
01:29:26,674 --> 01:29:28,802
Where the fuck you been?

957
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:33,223
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

958
01:29:43,233 --> 01:29:47,654
That is the sexiest thing
I have ever seen.

959
01:29:51,032 --> 01:29:52,325
Rusty, you're up.

960
01:30:03,795 --> 01:30:07,507
- You gonna answer that?
- I don't have a cell phone.

961
01:30:11,553 --> 01:30:13,263
This isn't mine.

962
01:30:15,014 --> 01:30:16,641
See who it is.

963
01:30:18,643 --> 01:30:21,646
<i>- Hello?
- May I have a word with Mr. Benedict?</i>

964
01:30:21,855 --> 01:30:23,398
It's for you.

965
01:30:27,986 --> 01:30:31,614
<i>- Who the hell is this?
- The man who 's robbing you.</i>

966
01:30:36,536 --> 01:30:41,875
- What's going on in the vault?
- Nothing, sir. It's all normal.

967
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:43,585
Show me.

968
01:30:45,587 --> 01:30:48,673
<i>- You're mistaken.
- Watching your monitors?</i>

969
01:30:48,882 --> 01:30:51,217
<i>Okay, keep watching.</i>

970
01:31:01,019 --> 01:31:04,064
In this town,
luck can change that quickly.

971
01:31:04,272 --> 01:31:07,692
- Find out how much money's down there.
- Yes, sir.

972
01:31:24,626 --> 01:31:26,002
Tess?

973
01:31:26,669 --> 01:31:28,296
Tess?

974
01:31:29,172 --> 01:31:30,924
Perhaps you should...

975
01:31:31,257 --> 01:31:33,176
Perhaps I should what?

976
01:31:34,052 --> 01:31:37,931
It would be better if you weren't
around here for this.

977
01:31:45,897 --> 01:31:48,608
All right, you proved your point.

978
01:31:48,817 --> 01:31:53,947
You broke into my vault.
Congratulations. You're a dead man.

979
01:31:54,155 --> 01:31:58,952
<i>- Maybe.
- Maybe? May I ask how you will leave?</i>

980
01:31:59,285 --> 01:32:03,081
<i>You think I'll let you
take my money out my casino doors?</i>

981
01:32:03,289 --> 01:32:07,460
<i>- No. You'll carry it out for us.
- Why would I do that?</i>

982
01:32:07,669 --> 01:32:09,295
Look at your monitor.

983
01:32:11,047 --> 01:32:15,635
<i>As your manager's probably reporting,
you have over $ 160 million...</i>

984
01:32:15,885 --> 01:32:19,973
<i>... in your vault tonight.
We're only packing up half that.</i>

985
01:32:20,223 --> 01:32:24,436
<i>The other half we're leaving,
booby-trapped, as a hostage.</i>

986
01:32:24,727 --> 01:32:28,940
You let our $80 million go,
and you get to keep yours.

987
01:32:29,149 --> 01:32:32,777
You try and stop us,
we'll blow both cashloads.

988
01:32:36,531 --> 01:32:42,537
You can lose $80 million secretly
or lose $ 160 million publicly.

989
01:32:42,746 --> 01:32:44,080
Your decision.
Hi.

990
01:32:55,383 --> 01:32:57,010
Make the call.

991
01:33:02,348 --> 01:33:04,184
<i>911 emergency response.</i>

992
01:33:05,477 --> 01:33:08,521
- Where's Danny?
- He's fine. He's in good form.

993
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:12,609
- He asks that you go up and watch TV.
- He does?

994
01:33:13,026 --> 01:33:17,822
We have three men with explosives
who have taken control of our vault.

995
01:33:20,617 --> 01:33:22,660
- Okay.
- It's okay.

996
01:33:23,078 --> 01:33:24,746
<i>- You have a deal.
- I promise.</i>

997
01:33:24,954 --> 01:33:27,582
Fantastic.
Here's what you do:

998
01:33:29,084 --> 01:33:32,879
<i>The guys in the vault will put
six bags in the elevator.</i>

999
01:33:33,129 --> 01:33:35,006
<i>It will rise to your cages.</i>

1000
01:33:35,256 --> 01:33:39,385
<i>Three of your guards will carry
the bags into the casino.</i>

1001
01:33:39,803 --> 01:33:45,308
If they take more than 20 seconds
to reach the floor, or there's a switch...

1002
01:33:45,558 --> 01:33:48,103
...we'll blow all the money.

1003
01:33:49,896 --> 01:33:53,274
<i>- He's in the casino by the slots.
- Of course I am.</i>

1004
01:33:53,483 --> 01:33:58,905
<i>I'm staying in your hotel.
I have two words for you: Mini bar.</i>

1005
01:34:00,657 --> 01:34:03,243
<i>Once the guards
hit the casino floor...</i>

1006
01:34:03,451 --> 01:34:08,873
<i>... a white van will pull up outside.
Your guards will load the rear.</i>

1007
01:34:09,082 --> 01:34:14,379
<i>If anyone so much as approaches
the driver's door, we'll blow everything.</i>

1008
01:34:15,797 --> 01:34:20,552
<i>When I hear the van is away and
the money is secure, my men will leave.</i>

1009
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:24,347
<i>Once their safety is confirmed,
you get your vault.</i>

1010
01:34:24,931 --> 01:34:26,850
The S.W.A.T. Team is here.

1011
01:34:28,476 --> 01:34:30,061
All right.

1012
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:35,442
Now, I have complied with your
every request. Would you agree?

1013
01:34:35,692 --> 01:34:36,985
<i>I would.</i>

1014
01:34:37,444 --> 01:34:40,321
Good. Because now
I have one of my own:

1015
01:34:41,156 --> 01:34:44,951
Run and hide, asshole.
Run and hide.

1016
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:50,206
If you're picked up buying a $ 100,000
sports car in Newport Beach...

1017
01:34:50,415 --> 01:34:55,712
...I'll be disappointed. I want my
people to find you, and when they do...

1018
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,716
...rest assured, we won't
hand you over to the police.

1019
01:34:59,924 --> 01:35:04,679
So, my advice to you again
is this: Run and hide.

1020
01:35:05,388 --> 01:35:07,766
That is all that I ask.

1021
01:35:30,163 --> 01:35:34,751
Mr. Benedict, our guys say that
van is headed for McCarran Airport.

1022
01:35:34,959 --> 01:35:38,546
I want my vault back
before that van hits the tarmac.

1023
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:51,518
<i>Night goggles on.
Prepare to cut power.</i>

1024
01:35:55,063 --> 01:35:56,314
Ready.

1025
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:00,985
Cutting power now.

1026
01:36:03,363 --> 01:36:04,531
Do it.

1027
01:36:06,324 --> 01:36:08,660
<i>Breaching elevator doors now.</i>

1028
01:36:09,244 --> 01:36:12,705
<i>We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.</i>

1029
01:36:13,248 --> 01:36:14,457
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

1030
01:36:14,707 --> 01:36:16,543
<i>Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!</i>

1031
01:36:16,793 --> 01:36:19,295
<i>- Take him down, now!
- I got him!</i>

1032
01:36:21,047 --> 01:36:24,134
<i>- Lights! We need power now!
- Give it to him.</i>

1033
01:36:35,729 --> 01:36:37,647
What's going on?
Talk to me.

1034
01:36:37,856 --> 01:36:42,026
<i>It appears an explosive incendiary
device has been detonated.</i>

1035
01:36:42,235 --> 01:36:45,947
<i>Continuing search for survivors.</i>

1036
01:36:46,156 --> 01:36:48,992
Tell them to take the van.
I'll be there.

1037
01:36:49,242 --> 01:36:52,328
And find out how they
hooked into my system!

1038
01:36:52,537 --> 01:36:54,080
Yes, sir.

1039
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:15,727
Get out of the van, now.
Now!

1040
01:37:20,231 --> 01:37:21,983
Tires. Tires.

1041
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:40,960
Our search yielded no suspects.

1042
01:37:41,211 --> 01:37:45,465
Nor can we determine how they
entered or exited the premises.

1043
01:37:47,967 --> 01:37:50,762
- Take your men out.
- May I suggest...?

1044
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:52,472
Now.

1045
01:37:52,847 --> 01:37:55,934
It's your vault.
Blue team, move it out!

1046
01:38:04,484 --> 01:38:06,778
Walsh, where are
we with the van?

1047
01:38:25,088 --> 01:38:27,966
I just want to try
something for a second.

1048
01:38:29,259 --> 01:38:31,594
There's nobody inside.

1049
01:38:33,263 --> 01:38:38,226
- I'm sorry. Did you want to get in?
- Enough monkey business.

1050
01:38:38,435 --> 01:38:40,061
Do it already.

1051
01:38:55,452 --> 01:38:58,580
<i>Mr. Benedict.
We took the van, sir.</i>

1052
01:38:58,788 --> 01:38:59,831
<i>And?</i>

1053
01:39:00,039 --> 01:39:03,376
<i>They say there was no
money in the bags, sir.</i>

1054
01:39:03,626 --> 01:39:05,170
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1055
01:39:05,378 --> 01:39:10,133
<i>They say the bags were filled
with fliers, sir. For hookers.</i>

1056
01:39:16,473 --> 01:39:17,599
Walsh?

1057
01:39:17,932 --> 01:39:19,768
Cue the tape to the robbery.

1058
01:39:22,353 --> 01:39:24,898
Yes, sir.
I'm looking at the tape now.

1059
01:39:25,648 --> 01:39:29,194
<i>Does it say "Bellagio"
on the vault floor?</i>

1060
01:39:29,402 --> 01:39:32,030
No, it doesn't.
I don't understand.

1061
01:39:34,365 --> 01:39:36,326
We had it installed Tuesday.

1062
01:39:36,534 --> 01:39:40,205
The images we saw of those
men robbing us was a tape.

1063
01:39:40,497 --> 01:39:41,748
<i>What?</i>

1064
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:47,629
It was staged. Somebody made
a duplicate of my vault.

1065
01:39:47,837 --> 01:39:51,966
What we saw on the monitor
wasn't actually happening.

1066
01:39:53,051 --> 01:39:56,930
<i>I don 't understand.
What happened to all that money?</i>

1067
01:40:07,482 --> 01:40:08,775
Make the call.

1068
01:40:16,449 --> 01:40:18,451
911 emergency response.

1069
01:40:22,205 --> 01:40:24,332
- Night goggles on.
- Clear.

1070
01:40:24,541 --> 01:40:26,042
Prepare to cut power.

1071
01:40:31,172 --> 01:40:33,716
Breaching elevator doors now.

1072
01:40:34,092 --> 01:40:37,303
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

1073
01:40:37,512 --> 01:40:38,680
Wait a minute.

1074
01:40:38,888 --> 01:40:40,682
Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!

1075
01:40:40,974 --> 01:40:43,727
- Take him down, now!
- I got him!

1076
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:33,526
Open the door.

1077
01:41:39,866 --> 01:41:43,828
Hey, Benedict.
How's the other fight going?

1078
01:41:49,542 --> 01:41:50,627
Pick him up.

1079
01:41:59,886 --> 01:42:01,805
Did you have a hand in this?

1080
01:42:03,056 --> 01:42:05,392
Did I have my hand in what?

1081
01:42:10,021 --> 01:42:12,065
I'll ask you one more time.

1082
01:42:12,315 --> 01:42:14,567
Did you have a hand in this?

1083
01:42:17,445 --> 01:42:21,449
Benedict, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1084
01:42:25,912 --> 01:42:27,330
Okay.

1085
01:42:28,581 --> 01:42:30,458
You're free to go.

1086
01:42:32,544 --> 01:42:34,295
Show him out.

1087
01:42:40,927 --> 01:42:43,596
<i>- Hello.
- Turn to channel 88.</i>

1088
01:42:43,805 --> 01:42:45,557
Who is this?

1089
01:42:54,566 --> 01:42:57,277
<i>What happened, Benedict?
You get robbed?</i>

1090
01:42:57,485 --> 01:42:58,987
<i>Stop.</i>

1091
01:43:09,998 --> 01:43:12,459
<i>I'll give you one last chance.</i>

1092
01:43:13,543 --> 01:43:14,794
<i>Where's my money?</i>

1093
01:43:15,003 --> 01:43:18,173
<i>What if I said you could
get your money back...</i>

1094
01:43:19,048 --> 01:43:21,050
<i>... if you give up Tess?</i>

1095
01:43:21,634 --> 01:43:23,595
<i>What would you say?</i>

1096
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:27,807
<i>I would say yes.</i>

1097
01:43:32,854 --> 01:43:34,147
<i>All right.</i>

1098
01:43:36,149 --> 01:43:39,194
<i>I know a guy.
We were in the joint together.</i>

1099
01:43:39,402 --> 01:43:43,656
<i>Anybody pulls a job in the Western
U. S., he knows about it.</i>

1100
01:43:44,282 --> 01:43:48,286
Give me 72 hours, I'll find
out who took your money.

1101
01:43:52,624 --> 01:43:54,667
You know a guy.

1102
01:43:57,378 --> 01:44:02,300
Contact the police. I'm sure he's
in violation of his parole.

1103
01:44:02,509 --> 01:44:04,010
Yes, sir.

1104
01:44:29,869 --> 01:44:31,371
Tess.

1105
01:44:33,289 --> 01:44:34,833
Tess.

1106
01:44:35,458 --> 01:44:38,002
You of all people
should know, Terry.

1107
01:44:38,211 --> 01:44:42,048
In your hotel, there's
always someone watching.

1108
01:46:22,482 --> 01:46:24,067
Wait!

1109
01:46:24,859 --> 01:46:26,194
Wait!

1110
01:46:27,654 --> 01:46:30,657
Wait, that's my husband!

1111
01:46:34,077 --> 01:46:37,497
- Danny.
- Tess, I told you...

1112
01:46:38,748 --> 01:46:40,750
...I knew what I was doing.

1113
01:46:41,626 --> 01:46:43,128
I didn't.

1114
01:46:43,336 --> 01:46:45,130
All right, let's go.

1115
01:46:46,339 --> 01:46:48,133
How long will you be?

1116
01:46:48,341 --> 01:46:50,844
About three to six months, I guess.

1117
01:49:46,394 --> 01:49:48,354
I hope you were the groom.

1118
01:49:51,566 --> 01:49:55,320
Ted Nugent called.
He wants his shirt back.

1119
01:50:02,952 --> 01:50:07,332
Thirteen million and you drive
this piece of shit to pick me up?

1120
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:09,375
I blew it all on the suit.

1121
01:50:09,584 --> 01:50:13,797
- Where are they?
- Back row, silver sedan. Ten o'clock.

1122
01:50:14,047 --> 01:50:17,801
I picked up your personal
effects. Hope you don't mind.

1123
01:50:20,303 --> 01:50:22,764
I'm not sure these belong to me.

1124
01:50:33,691 --> 01:50:35,151
- Hi.
- Hi.

1125
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,694
Rusty needs a girl.

1126
01:50:36,903 --> 01:50:39,739
There's a women's
prison down the road.

1127
01:50:41,366 --> 01:50:43,410
You said that you sold this.

1128
01:50:43,618 --> 01:50:45,245
I said that.

1129
01:50:45,537 --> 01:50:46,996
Liar.

1130
01:50:48,706 --> 01:50:50,083
Thief.
