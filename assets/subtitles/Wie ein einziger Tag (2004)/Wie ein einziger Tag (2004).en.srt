1
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,576
Excuse me.

2
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,209
Come on, honey, let's
get you ready for bed.

3
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,757
I am no one special,

4
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,734
just a common man
with common thoughts.

5
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,033
I've led a common life.

6
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,971
There are no monuments
dedicated to me.

7
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,100
And my name
will soon be forgotten.

8
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,940
But in one respect,

9
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,505
I've succeeded as gloriously
as anyone who ever lived.

10
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,641
- Looking good, Duke.
- Feeling good.

11
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,447
I've loved another
with all my heart

12
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:43,512
and soul and for me
that has always been enough.

13
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,955
How's it hanging, Harry?

14
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,687
I keep trying to die,
but they won't let me.

15
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,752
Well, you can't
have everything.

16
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,160
Big day today.

17
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,896
You say that every day,
you old devil.

18
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,239
It's a lovely day
outside.

19
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,503
Let's take a walk.

20
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,600
I don't think so.

21
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,941
Well, we've got to get
you out of this room.

22
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,571
Come on now, honey.
Some fresh air

23
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,048
- would do you good.
- Hello.

24
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,319
I'm sorry,
it's not a good day.

25
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,322
I don't think
she's up for anything.

26
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,516
Hello?

27
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,352
This is Duke,
he's come to read to you.

28
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,660
- Read?
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,732
No.
I don't know.

30
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,830
Oh, come on,
you'll like him, he's very funny.

31
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,882
Ahh...

32
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:52,257
All right now,
where did we leave off?

33
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,625
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it was the night of the carnival.

34
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,790
"Noah, was there with his friends,
Fin and Sarah."

35
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:02,028
- Noah?
- That's where they met...

36
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,161
June 6th, 1940.

37
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,505
Allie was
17 years old.

38
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,271
- Little man wins a prize.
- Damn!

39
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,540
- Thank you for playing.
- Ha, you're real funny.

40
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,840
Man, I clobbered
that thing.

41
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,848
I'm tellin' you,
these games are fixed.

42
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,509
- Hello.
- How are you?

43
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,484
Hi, what's your name?

44
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,214
Step right up here.

45
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,449
Over the hook, yeah.

46
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,490
Whoa.

47
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,553
- Who's this girl with Sara?
- Her name's Allie Hamilton.

48
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,030
She's here for the summer
with her family.

49
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,363
Dad's got more
money than God.

50
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,493
- Hi, Fin!
- Hi, honey.

51
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,334
Look, I won you a prize.

52
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,705
Oh, Fin, thank you!

53
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,111
- Oww!
- Yeah.

54
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,909
Hey great, huh?

55
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,779
Hey Allie, you want
some cotton candy?

56
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,842
- Umm, okay.
- That would be so much fun.

57
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,281
You only get
one chance, son.

58
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,689
- You want to dance with me?
- No.

59
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,854
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't want to.

60
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,887
Noah, she's with us.

61
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:09,834
Hey Allie, you want
to ride the Ferris wheel?

62
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,393
- I'd love to.
- All right.

63
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,064
Excuse me.

64
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,898
Excuse me.

65
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,880
- Noah Calhoun.
- What?

66
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,679
Works down at the lumber yard
with Fin.

67
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,879
Oh...

68
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,889
Did you see he was standing like
two inches away from my face?

69
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,050
Yeah, I saw.
That's Noah, though.

70
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,319
You know I'm surprised
he even came over.

71
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,693
I think he likes you.

72
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,512
Hey what... jerk...

73
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,919
Get off me.
Don't touch me.

74
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,014
- Hey!
- Well, I... ugh!

75
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,048
- What are you doing?
- Hey, you can't do that!

76
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,788
I'll pay you
when I get down, Tommy.

77
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,625
I'm Noah Calhoun.

78
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,756
- So?!
- So, it's really nice to meet you.

79
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,359
- Allie, who is this guy?
- I don't know, Noah Calhoun.

80
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,835
- I would really like to take you out.
- Friend! Do you mind?

81
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,473
You can't sit more than two people
in a chair, Noah.

82
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,975
Okay, Tommy,
all right.

83
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,607
Get down, Noah,
you're gonna kill yourself!

84
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,843
Noah, cut it out.

85
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,544
Now, will you
go out with me?

86
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,246
What?

87
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,221
- No.
- No?

88
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,586
- No.
- No?

89
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,284
Hey pal,
she just told you.

90
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,417
Why not?

91
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,451
I don't know,
because I don't want to.

92
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,519
Noah!

93
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,895
What? Well, you leave me
no other choice then.

94
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,125
Oh my God.

95
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,156
I'm not kidding.

96
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,931
- Noah, stop fooling around.
- What are you doing?

97
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,370
- Noah, grab the bar.
- I'm gonna ask you one more time.

98
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,998
Will you...

99
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,771
- or will you not go out with me?
- Noah, you best come on.

100
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,711
- God damn, my hand's slipping.
- Then grab the bar, you idiot.

101
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,476
- Not until she agrees.
- Ah, go on out with him, honey.

102
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,711
- Okay, okay, fine,
I'll go out with you.

103
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,013
- What?
- No, don't do me any favors.

104
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,384
No, no. I want to.

105
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,752
- You want to? You want to?
- Yes!

106
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,757
- Say it.
- I want to go out with you.

107
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,385
- Say it again.
- I want to go out with you.

108
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,759
All right, all right
we'll go out.

109
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,560
You think
you're so smart, don't you?

110
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,260
That wasn't funny,
Noah, you idiot!

111
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,736
No, it's okay,
I'll take care of this.

112
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,465
What are you doing?

113
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,495
Please don't do that.

114
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,064
Please don't do that, Allie.

115
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,837
I can't believe...

116
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,504
Oh God.

117
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,110
You're not so cocky now,
are ya?

118
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,013
I'm gonna get you for that.

119
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,450
Ah, maybe you will,
maybe you won't.

120
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,321
- Did he say anything to you?
- Oh, yeah, will you look at that?

121
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,259
It's that girl from the Carnival,
right?

122
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,763
Do you remember me?

123
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,289
Yeah, sure,
Mr. Underwear, was it?

124
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,063
- Well, I...
- How could I forget.

125
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,593
Yeah, I wanted to clear
that up with you,

126
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,128
because
I'm really sorry about that.

127
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,469
It was a really stupid thing
to do...

128
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,099
crawl up a Ferris wheel
to talk to somebody.

129
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,042
But I had
to be next to you.

130
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,238
I was being
drawn to you.

131
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,717
Oh... oh, jeez,
what a line!

132
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,118
You use that
on all the girls?

133
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,883
- No.
- Right.

134
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,221
I saw you the other night
with little Miss Ribbons.

135
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,919
- What are you doing tonight?
- What?

136
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,985
Or tomorrow night,
or this weekend, whatever.

137
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,963
- Why?
- Why? Our date.

138
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,259
What date?

139
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,028
- The date that you agreed to.
- No...

140
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,262
Yes, you did.
You promised and you swore it.

141
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,066
Well, I guess
I changed my mind.

142
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,039
Look, I know you get some dirty guy
coming up to you

143
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,599
on the street...
you don't know him.

144
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,474
You don't know me,
but I know me.

145
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,876
And when I see something
that I like,

146
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,247
I gotta ha...
I love it.

147
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,343
I go... I mean,
I go crazy for it.

148
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,150
Okay, what are you
talking about?

149
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,383
Well, you.

150
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,253
Oh, you're good.

151
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,920
- What?
- You're good.

152
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,430
- No. No, you're getting me wrong.
- You're good. You are.

153
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,988
- You're fantastic.
- I'm not.

154
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,897
You really are.
I'm impressed.

155
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,233
- I'm not usually like this, I'm sorry.
- Oh, yes, you are.

156
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,364
I can be fun,
if you want...

157
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,898
pensive, uh, smart,

158
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,673
uh, superstitious,
brave.

159
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,648
And uh... I can be light on my feet.

160
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,242
I could be
whatever you want.

161
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,015
You just tell me what you want
and I'll be that for you.

162
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,588
You're dumb.

163
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,224
I could be that.

164
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,121
Come on, one date.
What's it gonna hurt?

165
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,826
Umm...
I don't think so.

166
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,698
Well, what I can I do
to change your mind?

167
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,670
Guess you'll figure
something out.

168
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,141
- You sure she's coming?
- Relax, pal, it's all set up.

169
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,699
We're meeting her
for the late show.

170
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,575
Look... what did
I tell you? Come on.

171
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,654
Oh my goodness,
what a coincidence!

172
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,417
I need to talk to you
for a second.

173
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:01,222
- He's here!
- Allie, you remember Noah, don't you?

174
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,249
- Yes, I remember.
- Yeah.

175
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,228
- Come here.
- Fin!

176
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,924
- Hi.
- Hi.

177
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,297
- It's nice to see you again.
- You too.

178
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,495
- You look great.
- Aw, thanks.

179
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,231
Really, really great.

180
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,966
You do look great.
You look great.

181
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,407
And I know I look great,
so could we please go see this movie?

182
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,207
- The show's about to start.
- After you.

183
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,874
You come back here,
Li'I Abner.

184
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,475
You ain't gonna catch me,
Daisy Mae!

185
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,782
It's Sadie Hawkins Day,
I'm supposed to catch you!

186
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,549
I'm faster than you.

187
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,320
No, No!

188
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,554
I'll get you!

189
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,663
I'm going get...

190
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,165
Here I come!

191
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,690
You better run fast!

192
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,302
You ketchum Polecat
far and squar.

193
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,248
Wait for me.

194
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,314
What happened
in that movie?

195
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,820
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

196
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,423
- What are you guys doing?
- Want to walk with me?

197
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,454
Yeah, what's going on?

198
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,932
- Yeah.
- We're gonna walk.

199
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,458
Do you guys
love each other?

200
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,801
Huh?
Oh, I get it.

201
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,637
- You guys do love each other.
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

202
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,767
Okay, good bye.

203
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,300
- All right, all right.
- Mmm...

204
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,441
That was fun.

205
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,350
Mm-hmm.

206
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,786
I haven't seen a movie
in ages.

207
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,585
- Really?
- Huh-uh.

208
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,422
Not since
I was a little kid.

209
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,052
What?

210
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,892
No, I, uh...

211
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,524
I'm busy, you know,
I don't have a lot of time.

212
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,267
- You're busy?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,897
I have a very
strict schedule.

214
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,702
My days are all
planned out.

215
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,973
I get up in the morning... breakfast,
math tutor, Latin tutor, lunch,

216
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,743
tennis lessons, dance lessons...
sometimes both...

217
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,617
French tutor, piano lesson,
then I eat dinner.

218
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,644
And after dinner
I spend time with my family.

219
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,486
And then I... I catch up
on some reading.

220
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,994
Wow.

221
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,961
Sounds like the road
to success.

222
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,660
Oh, you bet.

223
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,361
We're applying
to all these colleges...

224
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:27,862
umm... Radcliffe, Sarah Lawrence...
those are the ones we want.

225
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,443
- And who's we?
- What?

226
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,571
You just said,
"The ones that we want."

227
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,274
Oh, Mom and Daddy.

228
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,112
We decide
everything together.

229
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,680
Everything?

230
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,381
No, not everything.

231
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,151
But the important
things, yes.

232
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,990
And then everything else,
you get to decide all by yourself?

233
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,698
- Don't be rude.
- I'm sorry.

234
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,329
Just trying to figure out
what you do for fun.

235
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,239
What do you mean?

236
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,641
I mean...

237
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,270
I don't know,
I mean all those things

238
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,873
are things you
have to do, right?

239
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,783
So what do you do
because you want to?

240
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,946
I just told ya.

241
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,685
I don't know.

242
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,217
This surprises me.

243
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,559
Why?

244
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:28,055
I just always figured
you were kinda...

245
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,897
Kinda what?

246
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,232
Just...

247
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,105
- Free.
- What?

248
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,665
Free.

249
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,470
I am free.

250
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,278
You don't seem like it.

251
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,285
Well, I am.

252
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,412
Come here,
I want to show you something.

253
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:55,120
- Noah, what are you doing?
- Just come on.

254
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,596
- You're gonna get run over.
- By all the cars?

255
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,964
My Dad and I used
to come out here

256
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,738
and lay down and watch
the lights change.

257
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,769
And watch them go
from green to red to yellow.

258
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,179
You could try it,
if you wanted to.

259
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,618
- No.
- Why not?

260
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,418
Because I don't know...
will you just get up?

261
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,856
That's your problem,
you know that?

262
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,717
You don't do
what you want.

263
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,661
Okay.

264
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,857
What happens
if a car comes?

265
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,586
- We die.
- What?

266
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,560
Just relax.
Just trust.

267
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,028
You need to learn
how to trust.

268
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,199
Okay.

269
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,999
- Painting.
- Hmm?

270
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,598
You asked me
what I do for me.

271
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,372
- What now?
- I love to paint.

272
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,608
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

273
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,707
Huh.

274
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,686
Most of the time, I have all these
thoughts bouncing around in my head.

275
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,020
But with a brush
in my hand,

276
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,821
the world just gets
kinda quiet.

277
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,562
Get out of the street!

278
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,436
Are you okay?

279
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,242
Why are you laughing?

280
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,988
Oh, that was fun.

281
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,090
Do you want
to dance with me?

282
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,822
Sure.

283
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,360
- Now?
- Mm-hmm.

284
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,031
- Here?
- Mm-hmm.

285
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,666
Not supposed to dance
in the middle of the street.

286
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,802
Who said dance
in the street?

287
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,471
And we don't
have any music.

288
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,981
Well,
we'll make some.

289
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,355
Bum bum

290
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,054
Bum bum bum

291
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,960
Bum

292
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,124
Bum bum

293
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,225
Bum bum bum
bum bum.

294
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,236
You're a terrible singer.

295
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,862
I know.

296
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,303
But I like this song.

297
00:17:56,341 --> 00:18:03,110
I'll be seeing you

298
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,345
In all the old

299
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,718
Familiar places

300
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,987
That this heart
of mine

301
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,793
Embraces

302
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,857
All day
and through

303
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:33,877
In that small cafe

304
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:41,785
The park
across the way

305
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:48,225
The children's
carousel

306
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,626
- The chestnut trees...
- Southern summers

307
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,892
are indifferent
to the trials of young love.

308
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,729
- The wishing well
- Armed with warnings and doubts,

309
00:18:55,767 --> 00:19:00,329
Noah and Allie gave a remarkably
convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl

310
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,102
traveling down
a very long road

311
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,337
with no regard
for the consequences.

312
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,072
They fell in love,
didn't they?

313
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,137
- Yes, they did.
- Good.

314
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,843
I like this kind
of story. Go on.

315
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,789
After that night,

316
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,021
Allie and Noah spent
every waking hour together.

317
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,756
And soon
they were inseparable.

318
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,663
- Noah, come on.
- Your boat cannot beat me there.

319
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,004
- That's really nice.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm...

320
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,020
"Beautiful dripping fragments.

321
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,752
The negligent list

322
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,987
of one after another,

323
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,394
as I happen to call
them to me.

324
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,295
Or drink to them.

325
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,425
The real poems,
what we call poems,

326
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,800
being merely pictures.
The poems of the privacy of the night.

327
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,806
And of men like me.

328
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,070
This poem,
drooping shy and unseen,

329
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,306
that I always carry.
And that all men carry."

330
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,576
Not bad for Whitman.

331
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,277
Hey, look,
we got a visitor.

332
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,151
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

333
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:25,088
Well, don't apologize,
come on up here, darling.

334
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,354
We could use a little something here
besides the smell of lumber.

335
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,522
Dad,
this is Allison Hamilton.

336
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,087
Allison,
I'm glad to meet you.

337
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,325
- Allie.
- Allie.

338
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,799
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Calhoun.

339
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,064
Well Mr. Calho...
What, am I old or something?

340
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,695
You can call me Frank.

341
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,763
- Here, come in and have a seat.
- Okay.

342
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,535
So, Allie.
Well, yeah, she is pretty, son.

343
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,273
- Yes.
- She's a lot prettier than you let on.

344
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,281
- Oh, is that right?
- No, it's not right.

345
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,543
Don't believe what he says.

346
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,177
- What is this you got?
- Umm, I... uh, I just...

347
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,516
I brought you something.

348
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,614
Let me see.
Let's have a look.

349
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,682
- Did you do this?
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,523
Well, that's beautiful.
Look at that.

351
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,222
That's a damn picture there.

352
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,461
Well, I know just where we can
put that, thank you.

353
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,094
Oh, that was
a lovely poem.

354
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,694
What was it?

355
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,330
- EI...
- Whitman.

356
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,900
See when he was a little kid
he used to stutter real bad.

357
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,503
- Dad...
- So... well, you did.

358
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,604
- I didn't know that.
- God. I stammered.

359
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,081
Stammered, stutter,
what's the difference?

360
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,880
Couldn't understand
a damn thing he said.

361
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:30,217
So, I got him to read me poetry
out loud.

362
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,722
It wasn't
very pretty at first,

363
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,019
but then his stutter
went away.

364
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,958
Well, it's a good idea,
that poetry.

365
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,517
- Yeah, I thought so.
- Huh?

366
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,325
Unbelievable,
unbelievable.

367
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,832
I'm a Tennyson man,
myself, but he likes Whitman...

368
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,732
For some reason,
I don't know.

369
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,294
Say, how would you like some breakfast?
Would you like some breakfast?

370
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,828
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.

371
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,273
- Dad, it's 10:00.
- What's that got to do with it?

372
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,607
You can have pancakes
any damn time of night you want.

373
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,545
- Come on, you want some breakfast?
- Sure.

374
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:00,045
It was an improbable romance.

375
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,919
He was a country boy.
She was from the city.

376
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,684
She had the world
at her feet,

377
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,919
while he didn't have
two dimes to rub together.

378
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,288
Noah, come on.

379
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,458
Whoo!

380
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,697
Look at us.

381
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,602
What are we doing?

382
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,508
Do you think in another life,
I could have been a bird?

383
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,705
What do you mean?

384
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,874
Like reincarnation.

385
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,782
I don't know.

386
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,377
I think I could.

387
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,021
Say I'm a bird.

388
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,686
No.

389
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,756
- Don't do it.
- Say I'm a bird.

390
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,767
- Stop it. Stop it now.

391
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,564
- You're not.
- Say it!

392
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,098
- You're a bird.
- Yeah.

393
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,645
Now say
you're a bird too.

394
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,546
If you're a bird,
I'm a bird.

395
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,248
- Come on, darling.
- What are you doing?

396
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,984
Don't.
Don't!

397
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,661
Here we go,
on the count of three, okay?

398
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,193
Real easy,
on three, ready?

399
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,796
- Okay, okay.
- One...

400
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,104
- Two... two...
- two...

401
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,700
...three!
- No! I can't.

402
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,939
Get in the water!

403
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,140
- Get in! I'm sorry.
- Come on, chicken.

404
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,116
Get in the water, baby.
Baby, would you get in.

405
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,141
- Get in the water.
- I can't.

406
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,653
- Go!
- Get in the water!

407
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:16,984
- One...
- Come on, jump.

408
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,081
- Two...
- Three.

409
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,299
Keep 'em together!
No, no, no.

410
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,237
- Get to your place.
- Down here.

411
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,740
And move.
And keep it.

412
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,764
No, don't move it!

413
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,674
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

414
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,179
They didn't agree on much.

415
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,012
In fact, they rarely agreed on
everything. They fought all the time.

416
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,642
- Don't kick me!
- Don't push me.

417
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,085
And they challenged
each other every day.

418
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,179
But despite
their differences,

419
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:54,158
they had one
important thing in common.

420
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,820
They were crazy
about each other.

421
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,228
Okay,
I have to go.

422
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,324
- No.
- Yes, I do.

423
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,379
Allie.

424
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,714
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy you're...

425
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:21,776
I didn't see you there.

426
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:24,744
You kinda scared me.

427
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,061
Becoming friendly
with that boy down there.

428
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:33,890
Yes.

429
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,792
Bring him
to the house on Sunday.

430
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,803
I want to meet
this young man.

431
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,601
Okay.

432
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,800
Good night, Daddy.

433
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,832
Good night.

434
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,810
Oh, boy.

435
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,614
This bug goes
"Daddy, I don't understand."

436
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:59,090
He goes, "Well, in theory,
we're both millionaires, but in reality,

437
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,648
we live with
a bunch of whores."

438
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,688
Bishop Stevens
told me that.

439
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:10,326
Olivier, please remove the... the liquor
decanter from in front of my husband.

440
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,767
I think he's had
a little too much to drink.

441
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,465
- I don't get it.
- Pay attention.

442
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,066
So, what do
you do, Noah?

443
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,975
I work at the lumber yard
with Fin.

444
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:24,141
Mainly milling and receiving logs...
and stripping the bark.

445
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,672
Oh, that's lovely, dear.

446
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,412
Thank you.

447
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,977
If you don't mind my asking, uh,
how much do you make at your job?

448
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,818
Uh, how much money
do I make?

449
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,756
Mm-hmm.

450
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,352
About 40 cents an hour.

451
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,965
Yeah, it's not much,
but I don't need a lot.

452
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,127
And I...
I save most of it.

453
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,461
Let's eat. Shall we?

454
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,633
Yes! Oh,
it looks delicious.

455
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,376
So Noah, you and Allie have been
spending a lot of time together.

456
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,450
You must be very fond
of each other.

457
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,619
It's getting
pretty serious, huh?

458
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,385
Yes, ma'am.

459
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:10,656
Well, summer's almost gone.
What will you do?

460
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,323
You know, Charleston's
only a couple of hours away.

461
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,491
But Allie's going
to Sarah Lawrence.

462
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,962
Didn't she tell you?

463
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,133
No, she didn't
tell me that.

464
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,707
I just got the letter.
I was going to tell you.

465
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,770
It's okay.

466
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,973
And Sarah Lawrence
is in New York.

467
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,715
I didn't know that.

468
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:42,493
Anne, this conversation's
too stuffy for the dinner table.

469
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,860
Let the children have fun without
bringing in the Spanish Inquisition.

470
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,058
My lips are buttoned,
right now.

471
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,626
I do know another joke about the Nun
and the full standing bishop.

472
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:53,960
- Stop
- That wasn't me.

473
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,132
I'm leaving the table
if you tell another joke.

474
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,175
Whoo!

475
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,473
I'm gonna do it.

476
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,504
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

477
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,451
That child's got too much spirit for
a girl of her circumstance.

478
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,516
Nah, it's just
summer love.

479
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,152
Trouble
is what it is.

480
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,063
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

481
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,816
Is that Allie
out there?

482
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,321
Do you want
to go somewhere?

483
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:51,652
Okay.

484
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,399
Wait here.

485
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,422
Allie!

486
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,588
Come on.

487
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,664
All right,
take a step.

488
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,101
Step. No, don't...

489
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,434
All right,
just stay there.

490
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,634
Don't open
your eyes.

491
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,214
Okay.

492
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,481
The Windsor Plantation.

493
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,045
It was built in 1772.

494
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,387
- Rumor has it that Francis Marion...
- Mm-hmm?

495
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:56,552
Proposed to his wife right here under
these... uh, these steps.

496
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,219
- Huh?
- Watch out.

497
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,323
You be careful, these are broken.
Look at that.

498
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,334
This...

499
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,131
This place is gigantic.

500
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,331
Yeah, a gigantic
piece of crap.

501
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,840
It is.

502
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:13,037
But I'm gonna buy it one day
and I'm gonna fix it up.

503
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,840
All it needs
is a new floor.

504
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,743
And new walls
and a roof.

505
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,842
- Is that all?
- And plumbing and electric.

506
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,353
- And furniture.
- Yes, and furniture.

507
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,980
But it's right
on the water.

508
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,820
And there's a big
old barn out there...

509
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,019
I could turn that
into my workshop.

510
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,153
Well, what about me?

511
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,686
Now don't I get
any say in this?

512
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,762
You want a say in this?

513
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:39,599
Yes, I would.

514
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:40,968
What do you want?

515
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,267
I want
a white house...

516
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,969
- with blue shutters...
- Mm-hmm.

517
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,671
And a room overlooking
the river so I can paint.

518
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,203
- Anything else?
- Yes.

519
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:54,150
I want a big old porch that
wraps around the entire house.

520
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,880
- We can drink tea...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

521
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,649
and watch
the sun go down.

522
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,788
- Okay.
- You promise?

523
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,294
Mm-hmm,
I promise.

524
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,660
Good.

525
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,462
- Where are you going?
- In here.

526
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,495
Wow.

527
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,876
I can't play chopsticks
if you're doing that.

528
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,173
Oh, God.

529
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,108
Oh, make love to me.

530
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:21,952
- Noah.
- Yeah?

531
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,553
Um...

532
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,961
I know I said that I wanted you
to make love to me,

533
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,192
- but I think you...
- Yeah?

534
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,427
You're gonna have
to talk me through this.

535
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,162
- Right. You all right?
- Yeah.

536
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,935
- Did I hurt you?
- No, no.

537
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,807
I'm just...
I'm just having a lot of thoughts.

538
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:43,143
I'm just...
I'm just having a lot of...

539
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,273
never mind.

540
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,690
Like what are you thinking?
What are you thinking, right now?

541
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,555
You know,
right this second?

542
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,619
Uh.

543
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:01,189
Did you know that this was going
to happen when you brought me here?

544
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,460
- No.
- No?

545
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,958
- No.
- No, you didn't think about it?

546
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,301
- Of course I thought about it.
- You did?

547
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,069
- Uh-huh.
- Well, what did you think?

548
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,236
Uh, I'm talking
too much, aren't I?

549
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,007
Okay, okay,
I'm just going to shut up.

550
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,537
Mum's the word.

551
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,016
Okay.

552
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:23,020
- You all right?
- Yeah.

553
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,454
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

554
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,085
I just don't understand
how come you're so quiet.

555
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,687
You don't have
one thought?

556
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,128
I'm going crazy
over here,

557
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,564
but no, with you,
everything's fine.

558
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,500
You don't have
a care in the world?

559
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,341
I'm sorry.

560
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,108
I wanted this
to be so perfect.

561
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,275
Now I can't shut up.

562
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,553
I love you.

563
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,617
Did you know that?

564
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,929
I love you too.

565
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,609
Yeah.

566
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:36,420
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

567
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,793
No, no, I want to,
I do.

568
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,731
Noah!
Noah!

569
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,429
What? Fin,
get out of here!

570
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,869
Look, I'm sorry,
but Allie's parents are going crazy.

571
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,805
They got every cop in town
out looking for her.

572
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,412
- You sent the police for me?
- Yes.

573
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,720
It is two in the morning.
We sent the police.

574
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,955
Thank God you're all right.
Where you been?

575
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,020
Mr. Hamilton,
all this is my fault.

576
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,998
Would you give us
a moment please?

577
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,933
I'd like to talk
to my daughter.

578
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,732
Alone, young lady.

579
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,676
Thanks for everything,
Lieutenant.

580
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,806
You bet, John, anytime.

581
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:33,339
You go straight home now,
it's late.

582
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,584
Sir, it's really
not her fault.

583
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,924
I lost track
of time.

584
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,261
Sit down.

585
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,499
I'm sorry, Daddy.

586
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,314
- Is he a rapist?
- No.

587
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:14,987
- Like what, mother?
- You are going to stop seeing Noah.

588
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,790
She is out fooling around
with that boy till 2:00 in the morning

589
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,126
and it has got
to stop.

590
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,927
I didn't spend
17 years of my life

591
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,231
raising a daughter
and giving her everything...

592
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,100
so she could throw it away
on a summer romance.

593
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,127
Daddy, come on!

594
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,140
She will wind up with her
heart broken or pregnant.

595
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,869
- Anne, please.
- Now, he is a nice boy.

596
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:35,845
- He's a nice boy, but he's...
- He's what? He's what? Tell me.

597
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,075
He is trash, trash, trash...
not for you.

598
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,310
Trash?

599
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,354
Don't touch me!

600
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,828
Now that is enough. You are not to see
him anymore. And that's final.

601
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,333
- No, it's not final.
- Yes it is.

602
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,858
- No, it's not final!
- Allie!

603
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,303
You're not going to tell me
who I'm gonna love.

604
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,002
- Love?
- Yes Daddy, I love him.

605
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,738
I love him.

606
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,769
He's not suitable
for you, baby.

607
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,424
I love him.

608
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,896
You are 17 years old,
you don't know anything about love.

609
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,899
Oh, and you do?

610
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,197
You don't look at Daddy
the way I look at Noah.

611
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,135
You don't touch
or laugh.

612
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,333
You don't play.
You don't know anything about love.

613
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,275
Noah?

614
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,777
Noah?

615
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,446
Hey, hey.

616
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,144
You leaving?

617
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,220
Oh my God,
I'm so sorry.

618
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,748
I don't even know what to say.
I'm humiliated.

619
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,852
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

620
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,988
- Yeah.
- No, it's not.

621
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,622
Shh...

622
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,738
No.

623
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,610
- I'm gonna go.
- No, I don't want you to go.

624
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,843
I got to think
about some stuff.

625
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,375
What do you
got to think about, huh?

626
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,320
Come here
and talk to me.

627
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,913
Talk to me!

628
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,924
About what?
You want...

629
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,721
you're going away!

630
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,523
You're leaving.

631
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,192
And I'm staying here.

632
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,895
And I'm so happy
that you're doing it,

633
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,336
but you're gonna have
a million things to do.

634
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,067
- No.
- You got so much ahead of you.

635
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,041
- Don't talk like that.
- It's true.

636
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:48,909
I'm not going to have
nice things, fancy things.

637
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,437
It doesn't...

638
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,007
It's never gonna happen for me.
It's not in the cards for me.

639
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,882
I don't have
to go to school, okay?

640
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,547
- Yes, you do.
- I can stay here.

641
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,056
No. Do you see, that's exactly
what I am talking about.

642
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,421
Then you can
come with me.

643
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,887
- To New York?
- Yes.

644
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,527
What am I going
to do in New York?

645
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,502
Be with me?

646
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,303
Yeah.

647
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,706
I don't know.

648
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,079
We don't got to figure all this
out tonight, ya know?

649
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,681
We'll finish out the summer and we'll
see what happens.

650
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,856
You saying you want
to break it off?

651
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,761
What I'm saying we see how it goes
later on.

652
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,695
Are you breaking up
with me?

653
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,276
I don't see
how it's gonna work.

654
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,244
I see...

655
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,182
Please don't do this.

656
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,685
You don't mean it.

657
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,319
Oh hell, well if you're
going to do it,

658
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,382
why wait until
the summer ends, huh?

659
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,655
Why don't you
just do it, right now?

660
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,389
Huh?

661
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:13,691
Come on.

662
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,062
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

663
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,158
Do it!
Do it!

664
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,862
Do it right now.

665
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,633
Do it!

666
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:22,798
Stop it!

667
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,068
Oh!

668
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:26,804
You know what? I'm gonna do it.
It's over.

669
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,812
Okay? It's over.

670
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,337
- Come here.
- Don't touch me.

671
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,373
I hate you,
I hate you.

672
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,679
I'm gonna go.

673
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,209
Why don't you, why don't you
just go. Get out.

674
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:40,951
Leave!
Go! Go!

675
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,456
No, no, just wait a minute. We're not
really breaking up, are we?

676
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,554
Come on.

677
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,121
This is just a fight
we're having,

678
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,225
and tomorrow it will be
like it never happened, right?

679
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,400
- Going?
- Gone.

680
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,240
Well, she must have
been devastated.

681
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,609
She was.

682
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,511
He was only trying
to do the right thing.

683
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,038
Yeah.

684
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,880
But what he really should have done

685
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,715
is just told those parents
to go to hell.

686
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,584
Just stick it
where the sun don't shine.

687
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:14,716
Yeah, you're right,
probably should have.

688
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,658
The next day,
Allie woke up

689
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:21,221
to find her world
completely changed.

690
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,540
What's going on?

691
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,337
We're going home.

692
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,934
- We're going now?
- Mm-hmm.

693
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,447
No, we're not supposed to be leaving
for another week.

694
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,177
Get dressed and then come and have
some breakfast, dear.

695
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:41,707
Willow will pack
your things.

696
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,811
Why, I'd be happy to pack your things,
Miss Allie.

697
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,151
I don't want
you to pack my things.

698
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,316
I don't want you to touch my stuff.
I'm not going.

699
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,825
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

700
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,020
- Yes, Allie, you are.
- No, I'm not.

701
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,723
Allie, you are going whether
you like it or not.

702
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,494
Now, even if Aaron
has to throw you over his shoulder

703
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:00,264
and drag you the whole way,
you're going.

704
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,701
Excuse me.

705
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,005
- All right, let's go.
- Come on.

706
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,739
We have to have all these
done by lunch.

707
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:09,768
Come on, get on!

708
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,405
You shouldn't be standing around.
Here we go.

709
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:12,437
Let's go.
Come on.

710
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,417
Fin!

711
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,115
Where's Noah?

712
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,886
He's out
delivering a load.

713
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:25,691
- What's going on?
- I'm leaving town.

714
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,287
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

715
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,822
- When?
- Now, right now... like today.

716
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,936
Look, I need you to tell Noah
something, okay?

717
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,700
I need you
to tell him that I love him.

718
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,264
And tell him
that I'm sorry for everything, okay?

719
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,905
Look, I was up all night
with him, Allie.

720
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,470
I've never seen him
so low.

721
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,712
It's over. Don't make it any harder
than it already is.

722
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,616
No! No, it's not over.

723
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,450
Fin, we had a fight
last night.

724
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:54,082
No, we said some things we didn't mean,
but it's not over.

725
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,523
- It is over.
- No.

726
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,186
Leave it alone.
Let it go.

727
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,593
I'm coming.

728
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,825
Mama, I'm coming!

729
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:07,692
- Look, he understands.
- But...

730
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:10,104
It's hard,
but he really does.

731
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,938
Summer's over
and it's time to go home.

732
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,308
If he wants to talk to you,
he'll write. If not?

733
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,012
Okay.

734
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,352
Okay, can you just... can you just
tell him that I love him, then?

735
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,416
- Can you do that?
- I'll tell him.

736
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,286
Thank you.

737
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,157
Bye, Fin.

738
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,573
She's gone.

739
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,822
Summer romances end
for all kinds of reasons.

740
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:41,020
But when all
is said and done,

741
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,895
they have
one thing in common:

742
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,959
They are shooting stars...

743
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:49,063
a spectacular moment
of light in the heavens,

744
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,835
a fleeting glimpse
of eternity.

745
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:55,106
And in a flash,
they're gone.

746
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,442
Noah was desperate.

747
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,643
He wrote to Allie
that he was sorry and stupid

748
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,618
for breaking up
with her.

749
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,419
He wrote to tell her that he still loved
her, and he wanted to see her.

750
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:10,552
And that if she would write back,
he would come to wherever she was.

751
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:16,296
He wrote one letter
a day for a year...

752
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,767
365 letters,

753
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:20,531
but they all
went unanswered.

754
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,335
Hey Fred!
Nothing?

755
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:24,670
Sorry.

756
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,438
All right,
thank you.

757
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,468
Finally, after a year
of silence,

758
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:33,643
he decided to put it all behind him
and start a new life.

759
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,618
So he wrote
a farewell letter

760
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:38,246
And he and Fin
packed their bags

761
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,119
and headed for Atlanta.

762
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,057
Noah! Noah!

763
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,957
Noah!

764
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,859
Come on,
listen to this!

765
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:52,665
A state of war has existed

766
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,638
between
the United States and the...

767
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,435
The Constitution
of the United States,

768
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,807
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

769
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,870
Noah and Fin
enlisted together.

770
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:05,905
And after two years
of chasing Rommel

771
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,746
through
the North African desert,

772
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:11,345
they were deployed
to Patton's Third Army in Europe.

773
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:21,957
Go!

774
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,838
Fin!

775
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,897
Do I contradict myself?

776
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,093
Very well then,
I contradict myself.

777
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,329
Allie was in her
third year of college

778
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:02,429
when she volunteered
as a nurse's aid.

779
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:05,236
To her, the broken men
with shattered bodies,

780
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,335
who filled the ward
were all Noah.

781
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:11,404
Or someone who fought
beside him in the jungle

782
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,212
or frozen
snow swept road.

783
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,650
I'm gonna lift you up.

784
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,210
Ready?

785
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,451
There we go.

786
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,891
Now, I'm gonna bring
this leg over.

787
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:25,087
- Set it on the stool.
- All right.

788
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,722
- You okay?
- Yeah.

789
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:31,097
Miss, can I
ask you a question?

790
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,102
Hmm?

791
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,967
I noticed that you
aren't wearing a ring.

792
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:39,339
And I was wondering
if I could take you out.

793
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,244
- Excuse me?
- On a date.

794
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:49,150
Now, before you go
and say no,

795
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:52,622
I'll have you know that
I am an excellent dancer

796
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,648
and my intentions
are completely dishonorable.

797
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:03,496
Okay, okay
"Casanova," come on.

798
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,626
Let's just
get you better,

799
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,899
then we'll talk
about a date, okay?

800
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,638
Would you get
a load of him?

801
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,979
Oh my gosh,
he is dreamy.

802
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:28,048
- What is he doing here?
- Mmm.

803
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,490
He's staring at you.

804
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,925
Oh, miss?

805
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,130
I'm all better.

806
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,861
Now, how's
about that date?

807
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,995
Allie was surprised
how quickly

808
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,370
she fell in love
with Lon Hammond.

809
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,805
He was handsome, smart,

810
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:52,679
funny, sophisticated
and charming.

811
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,809
Hey!

812
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,815
He also came from
old Southern money,

813
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,657
and was
fabulously wealthy.

814
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,801
What?

815
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:18,763
Hya!

816
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:22,468
Oh, what's happening?

817
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,002
- Where you going?
- Where they going?

818
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,675
- See you later, sweetheart.
- Oh dear, look at that.

819
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,949
Allie, I've been thinking a lot about
why we shouldn't get married.

820
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:34,616
Okay, I give up,
why shouldn't we get married?

821
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:37,149
Well see, that's the thing,
I couldn't think of anything at first.

822
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,992
An then, it just dawned on me.
Your parents...

823
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,861
- My parents?
- Absolutely.

824
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,832
- Your old mom and dad.
Thank you for that.

825
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,198
Mom?

826
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:46,793
You see, the problem is
that they love me.

827
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,395
- I'm exactly the type of man
- They do.

828
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,167
- They want you to end up with.
- Really?

829
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:53,768
You know, I'm wealthy,
I'm from the South, I got a decent job.

830
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:57,109
You know, I'm an incredible dancer,
I'm a really smart guy.

831
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,615
You look great.

832
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:02,117
- I like to think...
- So what's the problem, huh?

833
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,643
- Now just this, if you marry me...
- Mm-hmm.

834
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,349
- Now listen close.

835
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,152
- If you marry me...
- Mm-hmm.

836
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:11,490
Then you will have lost a life long
battle of defiance against them.

837
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,223
Oh my goodness,
what are we going to do?

838
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,491
- I do not know.
- Huh!

839
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:17,466
Hey, band,
you feeling all right?

840
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,696
Hey, band,
you feeling all right?!

841
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,704
Ooh bop sha bam,
shi bimmy bop

842
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,172
- Oh bop sha bam, shi bimmy bop
- You say it!

843
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:26,675
- Ally ally ally ooh
- Ally ally ally ooh

844
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,644
- Olly olly olly ooh
- Olly olly olly ooh

845
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,077
- Whooly ooh
- Whooly ooh

846
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,513
- Whooly ooh
- Whooly ooh

847
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:37,716
See Allie, I think...
damn it, I think you have to marry me.

848
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,813
- I think you need to marry me.
- I do?

849
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:41,050
- Yes you do.
- I do, why?

850
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,355
Because if you do,
you parents will always know

851
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:46,988
the unhappiness that you feel for
not being able to disappoint them.

852
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,828
I think you may
have overlooked one minor detail.

853
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,026
And what's that?

854
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,900
Well, you see you have to
get their permission first.

855
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:56,838
And I think you may have overestimated
their affection for you.

856
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,340
Is that right?

857
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,866
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I don't think so.

858
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:01,900
Then why not?

859
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,345
Oh, 'cause I asked them
already and they said yes.

860
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,178
What?

861
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:11,380
One more thing.

862
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,047
I love you.

863
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:17,355
Will you marry me, honey?

864
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:20,363
I know I kid around a lot,
but I'm crazy about you.

865
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:25,259
Marry me? Make me
the happiest man in the world.

866
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:30,097
Yes. Yes!

867
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,745
- Just hold tight.
- Where are you going?

868
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:40,648
Oh my God. Mama.

869
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,549
Okay, stop the band.

870
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,417
Excuse me. I'd like
everyone here to know

871
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,388
that this young lady
and I are getting married.

872
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,997
She agreed with all her heart,
but couldn't understand

873
00:53:57,033 --> 00:54:00,196
why at the very moment
she said yes,

874
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,263
Noah's face
came to her mind.

875
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,178
Hey, Noah, yeah!

876
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,915
Oh, good to see you.
Let me see you.

877
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,684
You bleeding anywhere?
No?

878
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,191
- Everything good?
- Yeah.

879
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:23,783
Oh, I love you.

880
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,694
Come on, there's something
I got to show you.

881
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,163
- Come on.
- All right.

882
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,497
What's going on?

883
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,799
What is this?

884
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,500
Here.

885
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,030
I sold the house.

886
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,502
- You sold the house?
- Yup.

887
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,376
Gotta be out
by the end of the month.

888
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,144
Between that and your GI Bill,
you ought to be able to get it now.

889
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,285
- Get what?
- Your dream house.

890
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,685
- The Windsor Plantation.
- Dad...

891
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,848
Now, don't Dad me,
I don't want to hear about it.

892
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:57,451
I already talked to the bank,
they're gonna give you the loan.

893
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:01,328
- Well, I can't let you sell your house.
- It's done.

894
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:04,856
It's a good thing.
You should do it.

895
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:13,465
Wait a second. You sell the house,
where are you gonna live?

896
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,068
With you, dummy,
what do you think?

897
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,443
Somebody's got
to help you fix it up.

898
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:28,282
Noah took a look
at the house,

899
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,816
but only saw
one thing...

900
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,158
Allie.

901
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:36,529
He decided right there
to fulfill his life-long dream.

902
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:41,162
He would rebuild the old house
from the ground up.

903
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:48,169
And when Noah went to Charleston
to get the building plans approved,

904
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:52,113
fate stepped in
and dealt him a sweet card.

905
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,990
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus.

906
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,255
Sorry, Mac, I can't stop the bus
until I get to the depot.

907
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,421
No, no, no, please stop
the bus now. Please!

908
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:08,021
Do you understand
English, pal?

909
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:11,363
No one gets off till we get
to the depot. Now sit down.

910
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,926
- God.
- Hey!

911
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,032
Watch it, screwball!

912
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,805
What are you doing?

913
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:23,710
Hey!

914
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,374
How old is your daughter now?

915
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,679
- Well, you mind.
- He's right over there.

916
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:48,133
Baby, hello.

917
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,304
- Oh!
- Hold it.

918
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:06,856
Oh, come with it.

919
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,760
After seeing Allie that day,

920
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,256
something inside
Noah snapped.

921
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:19,893
He got the notion
into his head

922
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,494
that if he restored
the old house

923
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:23,870
where they had
come that night,

924
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:27,502
Allie would find a way
to come back to him.

925
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,774
Some called it
a labor of love.

926
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:32,077
Others called it
something else.

927
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:36,279
But in fact,
Noah had gone a little mad.

928
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:37,980
- Excuse me.
- Would...

929
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:40,649
It's time to eat.

930
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,658
Lunch will be served
in the Sun Room today.

931
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:49,195
The melon is good.
I had a bite.

932
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,723
Did they ever
see each other again?

933
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,032
Noah and Allie?

934
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,538
Now you don't want
me to spoil the end of the story

935
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,542
before I get
to the good part, do you?

936
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,806
Where did I leave off?

937
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,506
I shall not want.

938
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,878
When Noah's father
died in November,

939
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,644
the house
was all he had.

940
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,914
He leadeth me down...

941
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:30,896
In time, Noah
finished the house.

942
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,931
Okay, smile.
Here we go.

943
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,773
He took a good look
at what he had accomplished,

944
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,783
got rip-roaring drunk
for 10 days,

945
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:44,116
thought seriously
about setting it on fire,

946
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:46,280
then finally
put the house up for sale.

947
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,119
I'm prepared
to offer you this much.

948
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,991
He had a number
of interested buyers,

949
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,895
but he always found a reason
not to sell it to them.

950
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,421
No.

951
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,491
Either the bids
were too low,

952
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,833
or if they met
his asking price,

953
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,464
he felt it was worth
a lot more.

954
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,270
It's a lot of money,
but I'll take it.

955
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,043
$50,000.

956
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,015
- That's more than my asking price.
- That's right.

957
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,449
It's a great deal more.

958
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,818
He told the man that offered him
$5,000 over his price

959
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,829
that no one in his right mind
would do that

960
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:29,627
and he wouldn't have
a lunatic living in his house.

961
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:35,861
He worked out his frustration with life
on the creek every morning.

962
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:41,204
And in the evenings,
to temper the sting of loneliness,

963
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,769
there was Martha Shaw.

964
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:45,576
Martha was a war widow

965
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:48,277
who lived in Quail Ridge,
a town away.

966
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:55,252
So you want to go out
tomorrow?

967
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,986
I got to work.

968
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:58,994
Well, we could
down to the river if you want to.

969
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,791
Next week, sometime.

970
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,491
Maybe we could
take a drive somewhere?

971
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,432
No.

972
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,628
Well,
I'm just asking you.

973
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:20,575
What do you want, Noah?

974
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:25,215
What do you mean,
what do I want?

975
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,721
From me.

976
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:37,459
Sometimes when you talk to me,
you don't even see me.

977
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:45,063
Look, a woman knows
when a man looks into her eyes

978
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,973
and sees someone else.

979
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:56,479
Now you know I want to give you
all the things that you want,

980
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,754
right?

981
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,587
But I can't,

982
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:08,495
because they're gone...

983
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,295
they're broken.

984
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,237
All right?

985
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,058
Is the veil too much?

986
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,158
Are you kidding?
You look perfect!

987
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,102
You're the most
beautiful bride.

988
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:52,232
- You look gorgeous, honey.
- Thank you.

989
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:56,234
Wait until Lon sees you in this dress,
he's gonna go crazy.

990
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,009
He won't be able
to take his eyes off you,

991
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,242
or his hands.

992
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:01,944
Oh, you're bad!

993
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:03,576
Have you seen
this morning's paper?

994
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:05,678
The "Daily Journal" says
that you are going to be

995
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,953
- the social highlight of the season.
- Of the season?

996
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,789
This is gonna be a celebration the likes
of which this town's never seen!

997
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:14,994
She doesn't plan,
she plots, doesn't she?

998
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,166
- Mama, look, the Governor's coming.
- He better. Let me see.

999
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,537
Oh, boy.

1000
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:54,728
- All right Savannah, where are we at?
- We're 82 now.

1001
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,413
- Memphis, where are at?
- We're 89 now.

1002
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,574
89, great,
up from 85.

1003
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,742
- Sir?
- Yes.

1004
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,217
You have a visitor.

1005
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,148
Well, hello.
Baby, I didn't know you were coming.

1006
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:16,352
I'm... I'm so sorry,
I should have called.

1007
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:19,418
Baby, what are you talking about?
You don't have to call.

1008
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,623
- Guys, could you give us a minute?
- All right.

1009
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:23,689
Yes, sir.
Miss Allie.

1010
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:24,893
Ma'am.

1011
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:33,105
So what's up?

1012
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:36,540
I don't paint anymore.

1013
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,815
I used to paint
all the time.

1014
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,181
I really loved it.

1015
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:45,016
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

1016
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:48,754
So paint.

1017
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:50,759
I will.

1018
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:55,724
- I'm gonna start.
- Great.

1019
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,467
Is everything okay?

1020
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:07,699
I need to get away.

1021
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,071
Okay.

1022
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:13,172
I need to take care
of a few things.

1023
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:15,207
I need to clear
my head.

1024
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:17,583
Okay,
should I be worried?

1025
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:20,987
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh, that's reassuring.

1026
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,790
Listen, are you
all right?

1027
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:28,491
- Yeah.
- Okay, then go.

1028
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,624
Take your time,
do whatever you need to do.

1029
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,861
It's okay to be nervous,
all right?

1030
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:35,097
It's normal to get
cold feet before your wedding.

1031
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:37,264
No, no second
thoughts, huh-uh.

1032
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:44,041
I love you.

1033
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,810
I'm going to be back from Seabrook
in a couple of days, okay?

1034
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:51,614
- Seabrook?
- Yeah, Seabrook.

1035
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:38,956
Hello.

1036
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:46,574
I saw your picture
in the paper,

1037
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,406
the one with you
and the house.

1038
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:51,311
And I just wanted to come
and see if you were okay.

1039
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:53,508
I mean, I wasn't
in the neighborhood or anything.

1040
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:54,538
I just...

1041
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:03,757
So are you okay?

1042
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,162
Okay, good.

1043
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:17,003
I'm a stupid woman,
I shouldn't have come.

1044
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,356
You want to come in?

1045
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:42,193
Okay.

1046
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,993
This is a good story.

1047
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:49,129
I'm glad you like it.

1048
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,235
I think
I've heard it before.

1049
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,368
Yes.

1050
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:59,409
Perhaps more than once?

1051
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:00,915
Doctor needs
to see you.

1052
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,180
- Me? Now?
- No, him.

1053
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,687
But he hasn't finished
reading his story.

1054
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:08,121
I'll read some more
when I'm through with the doctor.

1055
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:10,182
This shouldn't take
too long.

1056
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:11,955
- All right.
- Don't you go away.

1057
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:14,895
I'll be right back.

1058
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:18,058
While you waiting, maybe you'd like
to play the piano for a few minutes.

1059
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,089
You do like that.

1060
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,296
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

1061
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:24,738
- I don't know any tunes.
- You can read music.

1062
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:27,971
- No kidding?
- Mm-hmm.

1063
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:33,805
Who are you?

1064
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:37,114
I'm Dr. Barnwell,
one of the new attending physicians.

1065
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:39,587
We haven't met,
so I thought I'd examine you myself.

1066
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:44,525
Okay, so I see here

1067
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,791
that you've had two heart attacks
over the last 18 months.

1068
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:50,128
Yeah, minor ones,
I think one was angina.

1069
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:53,135
- Okay, any complications?
- Nope, feel fine.

1070
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:55,660
Okay, deep breath
for me.

1071
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:58,696
Okay, one more time.

1072
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:02,435
And deep breath.

1073
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:05,845
And one more.

1074
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:08,850
Terrific, terrific.
You still taking your medication?

1075
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:11,785
- Every day, twice a day.
- Good, good, good, good, good.

1076
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:14,255
Okay, you can
put your shirt on.

1077
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,989
So I understand that you
read to Miss Hamilton.

1078
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:24,591
Yeah, to help
her remember.

1079
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,931
- Hmm.
- You don't think it'll help?

1080
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:28,869
No, I don't.

1081
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:31,372
She remembers, Doc.

1082
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:34,672
I read to her
and she remembers.

1083
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:37,304
Not always,
but she remembers.

1084
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:39,473
But senile dementia
is irreversible.

1085
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,244
It's degenerative.

1086
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:44,309
After a certain point,
its victims don't come back.

1087
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:46,218
Yeah, that's what
they keep telling me.

1088
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:48,280
Well, I just don't want
you to get your hopes up.

1089
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:52,158
Well, thanks, Doc,
but you know what they say?

1090
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:55,789
Science goes only so far
and then comes God.

1091
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:57,526
Then comes God.

1092
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:02,996
Damn, I forgot to turn the page for her.
You through with me?

1093
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:25,019
I guess they flipped
that page.

1094
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,393
No, that she's playing
by memory.

1095
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:33,094
His name
is Lon Hammond, Jr.

1096
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:35,865
Hammond?
As in Hammond Cotton?

1097
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:37,429
As in Hammond Cotton.

1098
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,873
Well, your parents
must love him.

1099
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:44,642
He's a really good man, Noah.
You'd really like him.

1100
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,614
You love him?

1101
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:51,876
Yeah, I do.
I love him very much.

1102
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:00,755
Well, that's that.

1103
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:04,323
You marry Lon
and we can be friends...

1104
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,468
right?

1105
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:09,266
Right.

1106
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,573
Are you hungry?

1107
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,705
Do you want to stay
for dinner?

1108
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:21,642
Umm...

1109
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:32,826
I have to warn you,
I'm a cheap drunk.

1110
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:36,490
A couple more of these and you're gonna
be carrying me right out of here.

1111
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:39,467
Well, you go slow then, I don't want
to have to take advantage of you.

1112
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:41,992
You wouldn't dare.
I'm a married woman.

1113
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:43,766
Not yet.

1114
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:51,879
What?

1115
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,445
Why are you
looking at me like that?

1116
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,556
Just memories.

1117
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:08,488
This room.

1118
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,625
This...
is this where we...

1119
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,770
This is the room?

1120
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:23,804
Huh...

1121
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:34,712
- I'm full.
- Me too.

1122
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,624
"Oh how your fingers
drowse me.

1123
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:43,131
Your breath falls
around me like dew.

1124
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:46,328
Your pulse lulls
the tympans of my ears.

1125
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:48,859
I feel a merge
from head to foot.

1126
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:50,804
Delicious enough."

1127
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,506
It was real, wasn't it?

1128
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:59,109
You and me.

1129
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,640
Such a long time ago,
we were just a couple of kids.

1130
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:09,481
But we really loved
each other, didn't we?

1131
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,962
I should go.

1132
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:24,400
Goodbye.

1133
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:28,435
Do you think
you could back tomorrow morning?

1134
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:30,445
There's some place
I'd like to show you.

1135
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,839
Please.

1136
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,347
- Okay.
- Okay.

1137
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,726
She had come back into his life

1138
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:55,760
like a sudden flame,

1139
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:58,329
blazing and streaming
into his heart.

1140
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:00,740
Noah stayed up
all night

1141
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:04,303
contemplating the certain agony
he knew would be his,

1142
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:06,906
if he were
to lose her twice.

1143
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:10,908
Oh, I do wish I could
figure out the end of this story.

1144
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:13,717
The children are here.

1145
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:15,246
Children?

1146
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,383
- Not yours, his.
- Oh...

1147
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:19,417
Do you mind?

1148
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:21,520
Why, I'd love
to meet them.

1149
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,555
Come over here.

1150
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,000
- Hi, Daddy.
- Sweetheart, how are you?

1151
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,662
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Maggie.

1152
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:31,468
Hi, I'm Allie.

1153
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:33,498
- Hi, I'm Mary Allen.
- Mary Allen.

1154
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:36,010
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1155
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,602
- Hi.
- Hi, Maggie.

1156
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:40,171
Maggie, how are you?

1157
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,273
Hello there, honey.

1158
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:42,374
Hi, Davanee.

1159
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,909
- What a pretty name.
- Thank you.

1160
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:48,980
- Oh...
- Oh, how cute, thank you.

1161
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,224
- And who's this?
- Edmond.

1162
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,786
Hi, Edmond.

1163
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,806
You know, I think
I'll run on up

1164
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:11,836
and take my afternoon
nap, all right?

1165
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,111
- Come on, honey, let's go.
- There you go.

1166
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,947
- All right. Good.
- Thank you.

1167
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:18,976
I'll read some more later.

1168
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:21,615
All right, thank you.

1169
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:23,716
I'm so happy
to meet you all.

1170
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,190
- Goodbye.
- Bye, bye.

1171
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,491
- Nice to meet you.
- Goodbye.

1172
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:29,997
Bye.

1173
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:34,058
- She seems good today.
- She is good.

1174
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:38,365
I don't know, there's
something about today.

1175
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,705
Maybe it's a day
for a miracle.

1176
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:46,170
Daddy, come home.

1177
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,513
Mama doesn't know us.

1178
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:51,314
She doesn't recognize you.
She'll never understand.

1179
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:53,514
We miss you.

1180
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:55,386
This is crazy,
you living here.

1181
01:14:55,424 --> 01:15:00,088
Yeah, you know we'll all help with Mom.
We can take shifts visiting.

1182
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:04,330
Look, guys,

1183
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:06,926
that's my sweetheart
in there.

1184
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,733
I'm not leaving her.

1185
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:12,638
This is my home now.

1186
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,335
Your mother is my home.

1187
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:22,249
- Hello?
- Hey, there.

1188
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:24,946
Hi, who is this?

1189
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:26,750
It's Lon,
who were you expecting?

1190
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:29,780
Uh, nobody, I...

1191
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:32,453
I just... I'm just surprised.
How... how did you find me?

1192
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,394
Well, there's only one
hotel in Seabrook.

1193
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:36,420
And when you didn't call,
I got worried.

1194
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:39,764
Where you been?
Are you all right?

1195
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:43,498
You know, I feel like an idiot, 'cause I
called your hotel about a hundred times.

1196
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,873
I'm fine.

1197
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,104
Anything you want
to tell me?

1198
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:51,874
- No.
- No?

1199
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:53,006
No.

1200
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:58,080
Okay.

1201
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:02,621
Lon, I love you.

1202
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:05,183
Call you tomorrow?

1203
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,717
Okay.

1204
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:38,014
Noah?

1205
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:41,224
Noah!

1206
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:59,204
Hey, there.

1207
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,354
Well, we better get going,
the rain's coming in.

1208
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,408
- You like it?
- It's spectacular.

1209
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:42,212
It's like a dream.

1210
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:46,256
- Do you want to feed them?
- Yeah.

1211
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:05,769
What are they all
doing here?

1212
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,416
I don't know.

1213
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:12,215
They're supposed to migrate
to the Guatemala sound.

1214
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:13,915
They won't stay here?

1215
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:15,855
No...

1216
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:20,061
they'll go back
where they came from.

1217
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:32,531
You're different.

1218
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:35,065
What do you mean?

1219
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:39,738
Just the way you look.
Everything.

1220
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:42,750
You look different too,
but in a good way.

1221
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:50,515
You know, you're kinda
the same though.

1222
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:54,361
Yeah?

1223
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,523
Yeah.

1224
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:00,933
And you really did it.

1225
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:03,403
- What?
- Everything.

1226
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:05,167
The house...

1227
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,933
it's beautiful
what you did.

1228
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:14,976
Well, I promised you
I would.

1229
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:26,553
Great.

1230
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,620
We got to go.

1231
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:01,154
Noah!

1232
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:54,876
Why didn't you
write me?

1233
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:57,249
Why?

1234
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,747
It wasn't over for me.

1235
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:03,451
I waited for you
for seven years.

1236
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:05,083
And now it's too late.

1237
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:09,058
I wrote you 365 letters.

1238
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:12,966
I wrote you every day
for a year.

1239
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,401
- You wrote me?
- Yes.

1240
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:17,337
You...

1241
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,670
It wasn't over.

1242
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:21,801
It still isn't over.

1243
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,334
Oh...

1244
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:34,138
You got
to be kidding me.

1245
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:38,276
All this time,
that's what I'd been missing?

1246
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:44,949
Let's do it again.

1247
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:00,260
Noah.

1248
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:21,983
Noah.

1249
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,867
Wake up.

1250
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:36,399
- Wake up.
- Um-mmm.

1251
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:39,339
- Um-mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

1252
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:41,205
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm...

1253
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:46,146
- Hi.
- You're trying to kill me, woman.

1254
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:48,672
- Huh-uh.
- Mm-hmm.

1255
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:51,014
- Mmm...
- Mmm...

1256
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:54,385
I need rest.

1257
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:58,688
I need food
so I can regain my strength.

1258
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,559
Okay, what do you want?

1259
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:08,135
Umm... umm...

1260
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:10,137
some pancakes.

1261
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:12,332
Okay.

1262
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:14,466
And bacon.

1263
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:17,444
- Okay.
- And some chicken.

1264
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,826
She's the one,
isn't she?

1265
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,928
Can I meet her?

1266
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:17,398
I'd really like to meet her.

1267
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:19,269
I don't know if that's
a good idea, Martha.

1268
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:25,145
So this is Martha?

1269
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:28,149
Hi, I'm Allie.

1270
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,174
I've heard
a lot about you.

1271
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:33,320
I've heard
a lot about you, too.

1272
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:35,185
You want to come in?

1273
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:38,925
Are you sure?

1274
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,157
Yeah, yeah,
Noah's just saying how hungry he was.

1275
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,631
And, you know,
you could put on a pot of tea.

1276
01:26:46,734 --> 01:26:48,167
Come on in.

1277
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:53,170
Come on in.

1278
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,081
It was nice meeting you,
Martha.

1279
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:06,382
- Nice meeting you too.
- Goodbye.

1280
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:07,979
Take care.

1281
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:30,604
She's sensational.
She really is.

1282
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,744
I'm really glad
that I came, Noah.

1283
01:27:39,153 --> 01:27:41,246
I'd forgotten
what it's like.

1284
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,420
For the first time
since I lost Richard,

1285
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:50,931
I feel like I've got something
to look forward to.

1286
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:38,573
Mmm...

1287
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:11,330
Lon is on his way here.

1288
01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:16,768
I'm afraid your father spilled
the beans about Noah,

1289
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:18,711
and when Lon didn't hear
from you again last night,

1290
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:19,838
he decided to come.

1291
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:23,044
Well, that's great.
That's just terrific.

1292
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:26,576
You, me, Noah and Lon,
one big happy family.

1293
01:30:32,226 --> 01:30:35,059
Tell me about
the letters, Mother.

1294
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:37,360
- Is it true?
- Yes.

1295
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:41,130
You watched me
cry myself to sleep

1296
01:30:41,169 --> 01:30:43,569
for months and months

1297
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:46,072
and you never
said anything.

1298
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:47,768
- How could you do that?
- I'm sorry.

1299
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:50,209
- You're sorry? You're sorry?
- Yes, I am... I am sorry.

1300
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:51,905
Because of you,
my entire life is ruined!

1301
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,573
Okay, yes,
I stole your letters.

1302
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:55,241
It was wrong,
but stop being dramatic

1303
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,251
and at least take some
of the responsibility.

1304
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:02,322
You came down here.
You knew what you were doing.

1305
01:31:02,356 --> 01:31:03,721
You knew this would happen.

1306
01:31:03,758 --> 01:31:05,885
Oh, so now I'm a tramp?

1307
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:07,656
You are unbelievable.

1308
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:09,788
Unbelievable.

1309
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,062
Go on and get
some clothes on.

1310
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:18,196
Let's take a drive.

1311
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:20,935
Let's take a drive? Why would I want
to go anywhere with you?

1312
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:24,604
Because I might know you
a little better than you think.

1313
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:27,136
And I don't want
you waking up one morning

1314
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:28,808
thinking that
if you'd known everything,

1315
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,408
you might have
done something different.

1316
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:46,928
What are we
doing here, Mama?

1317
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:51,202
Do you see
that man, there?

1318
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:56,776
Mm-hmm.

1319
01:31:59,113 --> 01:32:02,048
Don't look like it now,
but 25 years ago...

1320
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:06,643
oh my goodness,
he was really something.

1321
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,315
We were out of our minds
in love, let me tell you.

1322
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:15,151
Wow.

1323
01:32:16,597 --> 01:32:18,929
Well, naturally,
your grandfather was furious, so...

1324
01:32:18,966 --> 01:32:21,161
we decided
to run away.

1325
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:27,674
We didn't even make the next town
before the police picked us up.

1326
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:32,338
But that was then.

1327
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:37,743
You know sometimes
when I'm in the area,

1328
01:32:37,785 --> 01:32:40,379
I just stop here
and I watch him,

1329
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:46,990
trying to picture how different my life
might have been.

1330
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:04,270
I want you to know
that I love your father.

1331
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:06,337
- Mama, I'm...
- No, goddamn it, this is important

1332
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:08,678
and you need
to hear it. I do.

1333
01:33:08,716 --> 01:33:11,207
He is a wonderful man.

1334
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:14,415
He is good to me
and I don't deserve him.

1335
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:17,253
I love him, Allie,
I do, I love him.

1336
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:21,961
I know.

1337
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:29,100
Oh, God.

1338
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:33,632
Oh, this is just
very embarrassing.

1339
01:33:33,674 --> 01:33:37,007
Oh, I'm a stupid woman.

1340
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:39,740
Look at me,
the big old bawl-bag.

1341
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:44,415
It's crazy.

1342
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:55,529
I don't even know
who that person is.

1343
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:05,662
Oh, boy.

1344
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:35,200
Okay.

1345
01:34:45,046 --> 01:34:46,513
Allie!

1346
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:05,059
Here.

1347
01:35:09,937 --> 01:35:12,963
I hope you make
the right choice.

1348
01:35:39,133 --> 01:35:41,533
Interesting morning?

1349
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:42,558
Yeah.

1350
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:46,666
Lon's here in town.

1351
01:35:49,844 --> 01:35:51,607
He's here?

1352
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:55,811
Yeah, we saw
his car on the way,

1353
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:57,442
at the hotel.

1354
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:04,916
Huh.

1355
01:36:07,628 --> 01:36:09,528
I see you
got my letters.

1356
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,931
Finally.

1357
01:36:21,842 --> 01:36:23,469
What are you
going to do, Al?

1358
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:29,875
I don't know.

1359
01:36:36,991 --> 01:36:39,016
We're back to that?

1360
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,220
Are we back there?

1361
01:36:44,098 --> 01:36:46,931
What about the past couple of days?
They happened, you know?

1362
01:36:46,967 --> 01:36:49,162
I know that they happened,
and they were wonderful,

1363
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:52,400
but they were also
very irresponsible.

1364
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:54,407
I have a fiance
waiting for me at a hotel,

1365
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:55,669
who's going
to be crushed

1366
01:36:55,709 --> 01:36:57,199
- when he finds out.
- So you make love to me

1367
01:36:57,244 --> 01:36:59,508
and then you go back
to your husband?

1368
01:36:59,547 --> 01:37:01,378
Was that your plan?

1369
01:37:01,415 --> 01:37:03,246
Was that a test
that I didn't pass?!

1370
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:05,912
No, I made a promise to a man, he gave
me a ring and I gave him my word.

1371
01:37:05,953 --> 01:37:07,181
And your word is
shot to hell now,

1372
01:37:07,221 --> 01:37:08,745
- don't you think?
- I don't... I don't know.

1373
01:37:08,789 --> 01:37:10,313
I'll find out
when I talk to him.

1374
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:12,348
This is not about
keeping your promise,

1375
01:37:12,393 --> 01:37:14,953
and it's not about
following your heart,

1376
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:16,724
it's about security.

1377
01:37:16,764 --> 01:37:18,891
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Money!

1378
01:37:18,933 --> 01:37:20,901
- What are you ta...
- He's got a lot of money.

1379
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:22,994
- Now I hate you, you smug bastard.
- Well, I hate you.

1380
01:37:23,037 --> 01:37:24,902
- If you leave here, I hate you.
- You wou...

1381
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:26,463
- Hate you if you leave here.
- Have you been paying attention

1382
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:27,599
to anything that's happening?

1383
01:37:27,641 --> 01:37:29,609
I guess not.
I think I must have misread

1384
01:37:29,643 --> 01:37:31,372
- all of those signals.
- I guess you did.

1385
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:36,778
You're bored.
You're bored and you know it.

1386
01:37:36,817 --> 01:37:39,285
You wouldn't be here
if there wasn't something missing.

1387
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:42,050
You arrogant
son of a bitch!

1388
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:45,021
Would you just
stay with me?

1389
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:46,890
Stay with you?
What for?

1390
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:49,919
- Look at us, we're already fighting.
- Well, that's what we do.

1391
01:37:49,964 --> 01:37:51,363
We fight.

1392
01:37:51,398 --> 01:37:53,593
You tell me when I'm being
an arrogant son of a bitch

1393
01:37:53,634 --> 01:37:55,932
and I tell you when you're
being a pain in the ass.

1394
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:59,167
Which you are
99% of the time.

1395
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:01,538
I'm not afraid
to hurt your feelings.

1396
01:38:01,575 --> 01:38:03,475
They have like
a two second rebound rate

1397
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:06,308
and you're back doing the next
pain-in-the-ass thing.

1398
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:07,336
So, what?

1399
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:09,941
So it's not gonna be easy.
It's gonna be really hard.

1400
01:38:09,984 --> 01:38:12,282
And we're gonna have to work
at this every day,

1401
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:14,287
but I want to do that,
because I want you.

1402
01:38:14,321 --> 01:38:19,315
I want all of you,
forever, you and me, every day.

1403
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,760
Will you do
something for me?

1404
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:24,821
Please?
Will you just picture your life for me?

1405
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,827
30 years from now,
40 years from now, what's it look like?

1406
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:32,566
If it's with
that guy, go! Go!

1407
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:35,336
I lost you once,
I think I could do it again,

1408
01:38:35,376 --> 01:38:37,310
if I thought it's
what you really wanted.

1409
01:38:37,344 --> 01:38:39,938
But don't you take
the easy way out.

1410
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:42,175
What easy way?
There is no easy way,

1411
01:38:42,216 --> 01:38:44,548
no matter what I do,
somebody gets hurt.

1412
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:46,815
Would you stop thinking
about what everyone wants.

1413
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:49,516
Stop thinking
about what I want, what he wants,

1414
01:38:49,556 --> 01:38:52,582
what your parents want.
What do you want?

1415
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:56,291
- What do you want?
- It's not that simple.

1416
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:59,595
- What do you want?
- It's not...

1417
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:02,802
Goddamn it,
what do you want?

1418
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:07,506
I have to go.

1419
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:18,874
My dearest Allie,

1420
01:40:18,912 --> 01:40:22,245
I couldn't sleep last night because
I know that it's over between us.

1421
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:27,518
I'm not bitter anymore, because I know
that what we had was real.

1422
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:31,089
And if in some distant
place in the future

1423
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:33,753
we see each other
in our new lives,

1424
01:40:33,794 --> 01:40:35,421
I'll smile
at you with joy

1425
01:40:35,462 --> 01:40:39,592
and remember how
we spent a summer beneath the trees

1426
01:40:39,633 --> 01:40:43,501
learning from each other
and growing in love.

1427
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:03,453
The best love
is the kind that awakens the soul

1428
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:05,981
and makes us
reach for more,

1429
01:41:06,026 --> 01:41:08,324
that plants a fire
in our hearts

1430
01:41:08,362 --> 01:41:11,160
and brings peace
to our minds.

1431
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:13,996
And that's what you've
given me.

1432
01:41:14,034 --> 01:41:16,901
That's what I'd hoped
to give to you forever.

1433
01:41:16,937 --> 01:41:20,998
I love you.
I'll be seeing you, Noah.

1434
01:41:22,309 --> 01:41:26,040
It's beautiful.
It's a beautiful story.

1435
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,377
Yes, it is.

1436
01:41:27,414 --> 01:41:30,747
I don't know why,
but it makes me feel sad.

1437
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,711
I know you feel
lost right now,

1438
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:37,587
but don't worry,

1439
01:41:37,624 --> 01:41:40,115
nothing is ever lost,
nor can be lost.

1440
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:43,960
The body sluggish,
aged, cold,

1441
01:41:43,997 --> 01:41:46,192
the embers left

1442
01:41:46,233 --> 01:41:47,928
from earlier fires.

1443
01:41:47,968 --> 01:41:49,833
Shall duly flame again.

1444
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:53,198
Did you write that?

1445
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,607
No, that was Walt Whitman.

1446
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,239
I think I knew him.

1447
01:42:01,248 --> 01:42:02,647
I think you did.

1448
01:42:02,683 --> 01:42:07,677
Shall we go in?
I'm feeling a little chilly.

1449
01:42:07,721 --> 01:42:09,746
Okay.

1450
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:11,587
Thank you.

1451
01:42:21,502 --> 01:42:23,094
Well, who did
all of this?

1452
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:27,130
I did, with a little help
from my friends on the nursing staff.

1453
01:42:27,174 --> 01:42:29,369
Oh...

1454
01:42:42,356 --> 01:42:45,917
I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

1455
01:42:45,959 --> 01:42:47,688
Neither have I.

1456
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:51,859
Shall we?

1457
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:02,407
- Some grape juice?
- I'd love it.

1458
01:43:05,145 --> 01:43:08,137
Ah, so many pills.
How sick are you?

1459
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:12,050
The sickness has become
a relative term for me.

1460
01:43:12,085 --> 01:43:16,715
I think of it now as more a general
wearing out process.

1461
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:19,514
To you.

1462
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:30,533
So what happened?

1463
01:43:30,571 --> 01:43:32,334
In the story,

1464
01:43:32,372 --> 01:43:34,533
which one did she choose?

1465
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:40,077
Okay,

1466
01:43:42,015 --> 01:43:44,848
the way I see it,
I got three choices.

1467
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:46,477
One, I can shoot him.

1468
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:50,513
Two, I can kick
the crap out of him.

1469
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:53,856
Or three...
I leave you.

1470
01:44:00,267 --> 01:44:02,531
Well, all that's no good.

1471
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:06,100
You see, 'cause...

1472
01:44:07,774 --> 01:44:10,299
none of those options
get me you.

1473
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:15,808
And in spite of everything,

1474
01:44:15,849 --> 01:44:17,316
I love you.

1475
01:44:20,153 --> 01:44:21,484
I love you too.

1476
01:44:23,423 --> 01:44:25,550
I meant what I said
when I gave you that ring.

1477
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:26,923
I did too.

1478
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,588
I did too.
It's just that when I'm...

1479
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:31,791
when I'm with Noah
I feel like one person

1480
01:44:31,832 --> 01:44:35,131
and when I'm with you
I feel like someone totally different.

1481
01:44:37,371 --> 01:44:41,171
Look, it's normal
not to forget your first love.

1482
01:44:49,016 --> 01:44:51,507
I love you, Allie,

1483
01:44:51,551 --> 01:44:54,645
but I want you
for myself.

1484
01:44:54,688 --> 01:44:56,417
I don't want to have
to convince my fiance

1485
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:58,947
that she should be
with me.

1486
01:44:58,992 --> 01:45:02,155
You don't have to.

1487
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:05,595
I already know
I should be with you.

1488
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:09,966
And they lived happily
ever after.

1489
01:45:10,003 --> 01:45:13,598
Who? Who did?

1490
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:24,715
Oh yes,

1491
01:45:24,751 --> 01:45:26,685
of course.

1492
01:46:08,562 --> 01:46:10,427
I remember now.

1493
01:46:11,732 --> 01:46:13,700
It was us.

1494
01:46:14,868 --> 01:46:17,200
- It was us. It was us.
- Oh, my darling.

1495
01:46:17,237 --> 01:46:19,603
Oh my sweetheart.

1496
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:22,608
I love you so much.

1497
01:46:24,644 --> 01:46:26,111
Oh, my baby.

1498
01:46:28,315 --> 01:46:30,146
Noah, Noah.

1499
01:46:30,183 --> 01:46:32,674
I love you, Angel.

1500
01:46:35,455 --> 01:46:37,582
- What happened to me?
- Nothing.

1501
01:46:37,624 --> 01:46:40,252
You just went away
for a little while.

1502
01:46:44,297 --> 01:46:48,495
- How much time do we have?
- I'm not sure.

1503
01:46:48,535 --> 01:46:50,867
Last time it was no more
than five minutes.

1504
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:55,735
Okay.

1505
01:46:55,776 --> 01:46:59,940
Hey, I brought along
an old friend.

1506
01:47:17,063 --> 01:47:21,193
I'll be seeing you

1507
01:47:21,234 --> 01:47:26,331
In all the old
familiar places

1508
01:47:26,373 --> 01:47:31,777
That this heart
of mine embraces

1509
01:47:31,812 --> 01:47:34,679
All day through

1510
01:47:37,317 --> 01:47:40,844
In that small cafe...

1511
01:47:40,887 --> 01:47:44,186
- How are the children?
- Oh, they're fine.

1512
01:47:44,224 --> 01:47:46,192
Now,
they were here today...

1513
01:47:46,226 --> 01:47:48,990
Little Noah, Davanee too.

1514
01:47:49,029 --> 01:47:50,621
They're getting so big.

1515
01:47:50,664 --> 01:47:55,067
...carousel, the chestnut trees
- Oh, boy.

1516
01:47:55,101 --> 01:47:57,126
- The wishing well...
- How fast the time goes.

1517
01:47:57,170 --> 01:47:58,660
Mm-hmm.

1518
01:47:58,705 --> 01:48:00,696
It flies right on by.

1519
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:02,674
Oh yes, it does.

1520
01:48:02,709 --> 01:48:08,147
In every lovely
summer's day...

1521
01:48:08,181 --> 01:48:10,376
Will you tell them
I love them?

1522
01:48:10,417 --> 01:48:13,716
- That's light and gay
- Of course I will.

1523
01:48:13,753 --> 01:48:15,516
- I'll always
- And that I'm sorry.

1524
01:48:15,555 --> 01:48:18,115
Think of you that way

1525
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:20,149
- I'll tell them, sweetheart.
- I'll find you

1526
01:48:20,193 --> 01:48:23,993
In the morning sun

1527
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:27,727
And when
the night is new

1528
01:48:29,035 --> 01:48:33,131
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you...

1529
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:36,165
Remember that story you were
reading to me?

1530
01:48:36,209 --> 01:48:38,109
Why, yes.

1531
01:48:44,618 --> 01:48:47,451
Do you think that
I could be her tonight?

1532
01:48:49,222 --> 01:48:50,814
Would that be
all right?

1533
01:48:51,858 --> 01:48:53,621
You know what
we could do?

1534
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:57,255
Maybe we could get a car
and we could go for a ride.

1535
01:48:57,297 --> 01:49:00,858
Why could get out of here
and just go someplace, you want to?

1536
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:04,029
I don't think so.
Not tonight, darling.

1537
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:06,800
Come on, why not?

1538
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,831
Wait a minute...

1539
01:49:10,744 --> 01:49:14,271
why did you call me darling?
I don't know you.

1540
01:49:14,314 --> 01:49:17,306
What's going on here?
Am I supposed to know you?

1541
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:20,148
- Allie... Allie, sweetheart.
- No, no, no!

1542
01:49:20,186 --> 01:49:22,746
Hey, Allie, I love you,
stay with me, don't leave...

1543
01:49:22,789 --> 01:49:25,053
No!

1544
01:49:25,091 --> 01:49:28,219
- Who are you?
- I'm Noah, I'm Noah and you're Allie.

1545
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:30,821
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

1546
01:49:30,864 --> 01:49:33,094
- Come on, baby.
- Don't come near me!

1547
01:49:33,133 --> 01:49:34,998
- Don't you come near me!
- Allie... Allie, I...

1548
01:49:35,035 --> 01:49:36,730
Help! Help!

1549
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:38,761
- Help me!
- Calm down, Allie, calm down.

1550
01:49:38,805 --> 01:49:39,794
No, no, not you!

1551
01:49:39,839 --> 01:49:41,466
Calm down, Allie! It's all right, sugar,
come on.

1552
01:49:41,508 --> 01:49:43,408
- No! Let me go!
- It's all right, baby. Just calm down!

1553
01:49:43,443 --> 01:49:46,810
- No! Leave me alone.
- Calm down, Allie, it's all right.

1554
01:49:46,846 --> 01:49:48,814
- Somebody help me!
- Now calm down.

1555
01:49:48,848 --> 01:49:49,940
- Help!
- Doctor!

1556
01:49:49,983 --> 01:49:51,917
Talk to me.

1557
01:49:51,952 --> 01:49:54,318
- Somebody help me!
- Calm down!

1558
01:49:54,354 --> 01:49:57,289
- Give her two cc's.
- No! No!

1559
01:49:57,324 --> 01:49:58,450
Calm down, Allie.

1560
01:49:58,491 --> 01:50:00,118
- Calm down, Allie, yes.
- One, two...

1561
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,855
...three.

1562
01:50:01,895 --> 01:50:04,796
- Allie, it's all right. It's all right.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1563
01:50:04,831 --> 01:50:06,389
Okay, now take a look.

1564
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:09,197
Let's take a look.
One... oh, she's fine.

1565
01:50:09,235 --> 01:50:11,465
- Good. Just breathe.
- She's fine. She's fine.

1566
01:50:11,504 --> 01:50:14,302
Stay calm, just breathe
in and out, come on.

1567
01:50:14,341 --> 01:50:16,571
- Relax...
- You're going to be okay, Allie.

1568
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:17,975
- Relax.
- Allie?

1569
01:50:18,011 --> 01:50:20,605
You're fine, honey.

1570
01:50:20,647 --> 01:50:21,841
Shh...

1571
01:50:21,881 --> 01:50:26,250
I'll be seeing you

1572
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:31,656
In every lovely
summer's day

1573
01:50:31,691 --> 01:50:37,391
In everything
that's light and gay

1574
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:41,799
I'll always think
of you that way

1575
01:50:41,835 --> 01:50:47,239
I'll find you
in the morning sun

1576
01:50:47,273 --> 01:50:50,640
And when
the night is new...

1577
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:57,649
I'll be looking
at the moon

1578
01:51:01,021 --> 01:51:06,323
But I'll be seeing you

1579
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:08,486
I'll be seeing you

1580
01:51:08,528 --> 01:51:12,225
I'll be seeing you.

1581
01:51:19,172 --> 01:51:21,197
Morning, Mr. Calhoun.

1582
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:23,567
Mr. Calhoun?

1583
01:51:25,812 --> 01:51:28,303
Call Dr. Von Pettit
and USC, okay?

1584
01:51:28,348 --> 01:51:30,714
I've got no BP, I got no pulse.
I've got nothing.

1585
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:33,048
Let them know we are in full arrest.
Call me on my cell.

1586
01:51:33,086 --> 01:51:35,486
Okay, will do.

1587
01:51:51,838 --> 01:51:54,739
We talked about this.

1588
01:51:54,774 --> 01:51:57,436
It's all right now.
Come on, come on, precious.

1589
01:51:57,477 --> 01:52:00,173
Okay, yes,
come on, let's go.

1590
01:52:00,213 --> 01:52:01,976
It's okay, baby,
come on.

1591
01:52:02,015 --> 01:52:04,449
You know Mr. Holmes.

1592
01:52:08,188 --> 01:52:10,019
Just try it.

1593
01:52:55,568 --> 01:52:57,263
Oh, Mr. Calhoun.

1594
01:52:58,705 --> 01:53:00,297
Welcome back.

1595
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:04,071
- How do you feel?
- Fine. Fit as a fiddle.

1596
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:07,546
- Where you going?
- I was just taking a walk.

1597
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:09,946
I can't sleep.

1598
01:53:09,983 --> 01:53:12,679
Well, you know you're not supposed to,
it's against the rules.

1599
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:15,153
Yeah, I know.

1600
01:53:15,188 --> 01:53:18,385
You weren't really
going for a walk, were you?

1601
01:53:18,424 --> 01:53:20,619
You were going
to see Miss Allie.

1602
01:53:21,928 --> 01:53:24,226
I just got out
of the hospital

1603
01:53:24,264 --> 01:53:26,095
and I miss her.

1604
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:28,123
Mr. Calhoun,

1605
01:53:28,168 --> 01:53:30,796
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you see her tonight.

1606
01:53:30,837 --> 01:53:34,364
Now you're gonna have
to go back to your room.

1607
01:53:36,376 --> 01:53:37,570
As for me,

1608
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:39,601
I'm gonna
go downstairs

1609
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:42,240
and get myself
a cup of coffee.

1610
01:53:42,282 --> 01:53:45,115
I won't be back
to check on you for a while,

1611
01:53:45,151 --> 01:53:47,210
so don't
do anything foolish.

1612
01:54:43,476 --> 01:54:44,966
Hi.

1613
01:54:54,254 --> 01:54:55,243
Noah.

1614
01:54:57,557 --> 01:54:58,785
Noah.

1615
01:55:01,661 --> 01:55:04,357
Hi, sweetheart.

1616
01:55:04,397 --> 01:55:07,628
I'm sorry I haven't
been able to be here to read to you.

1617
01:55:08,935 --> 01:55:11,529
I didn't know
what to do.

1618
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:14,199
I was afraid
you were never coming back.

1619
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:16,208
I'll always come back.

1620
01:55:21,114 --> 01:55:24,106
What's gonna happen

1621
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:27,244
when I can't
remember anything any more?

1622
01:55:29,222 --> 01:55:30,416
What will you do?

1623
01:55:30,456 --> 01:55:33,516
I'll be here.

1624
01:55:33,559 --> 01:55:35,789
I'll never leave you.

1625
01:55:45,004 --> 01:55:47,472
I need to ask
you something.

1626
01:55:47,507 --> 01:55:49,304
What is it,
sweetheart?

1627
01:55:53,813 --> 01:55:56,941
Do you think

1628
01:55:56,983 --> 01:55:58,974
that our love

1629
01:55:59,018 --> 01:56:01,111
can create miracles?

1630
01:56:02,655 --> 01:56:04,520
Yes, I do.

1631
01:56:05,925 --> 01:56:09,190
That's what brings
you back to me each time.

1632
01:56:17,403 --> 01:56:20,668
Do you think our love

1633
01:56:20,707 --> 01:56:22,937
could take us
away together?

1634
01:56:29,649 --> 01:56:33,346
I think our love
can do anything we want it to.

1635
01:56:46,366 --> 01:56:49,358
I love you.

1636
01:56:49,402 --> 01:56:51,427
I love you, Allie.

1637
01:57:08,254 --> 01:57:10,688
Good night.

1638
01:57:10,723 --> 01:57:12,714
Good night.

1639
01:57:17,630 --> 01:57:20,098
I'll be seeing you.

1640
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:23,967
La la la la

1641
01:57:24,003 --> 01:57:25,732
Da da da da

1642
01:57:25,772 --> 01:57:27,899
Dum ba da
