Can we do it some other day?

19
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:35,542
It's not convenient right now

20
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,375
Since I'm  already here,

21
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:40,000
let's just play around for a bit

22
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:44,417
It's all private. No one else shall know who wins

23
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:47,417
It's not a matter of winning. I'm  having dinner

24
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:50,375
In that case... I'll wait for you

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,375
Master Liu

26
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:03,250

That's good

33
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,250

00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:39,875
Master Liu

39
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:32,332
I'm  fine...

40
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's start again!

41

00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:44,957
All touch

45
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,500
Thanks for being lenient, Master Liu

46
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:18,957
Thanks for teaching me. I've learnt a lot

47
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:20,500
The pleasure was all mine

48
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:23,625
Regarding this private duel, Master lp...

49
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:26,332
l won't tell anyone. Don't worry

50
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,625
Thanks so much. I'm  totally grateful

51
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,750
Goodbye

52
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,375
Farewell

53
00:07:33,457 --> 00:07:34,750
So long

54
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,625


55
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,125
lp pushed Master Liu's whole body away

56
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,167
Isn't "Move 1000 Catties with 4 Taels" Tai Chi?

57
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,250
l thought Master Ip practiced

58
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,457
Anyway, he pushed him away with one hand

59
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:51,042
Liu refused to admit de

60
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,792
lp kept chasing after him fiercely!

61
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:57,167
But Liu remained indignant after being hit

62
00:07:57,457 --> 00:07:59,500
He jumped at Ip like a hungry dog

63
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,791
These tea leaves are pretty good and cheap

64
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,875
Thank you

65
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,500
Got to go Farewell

66
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,750
Goodbye Goodbye, see you next time

67
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,500
Who put these here, Uncle Ping?

68
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:18,082
Your brother

69
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,042
l thought Liu was good but he's so bad at defense

70
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,417
and was beaten up like a pighead

71
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:27,957
He co-owns his dad's restaurant. He's always idle

72
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,042
Ask that kid to serve the customers

73
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,000
Good morning

74
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:31,917
Brother lp!

75
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:33,000
Morning, Master lp

76
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:33,832
ls Quan here yet?

77
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,417
He's waiting for you upstairs

78
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,125
Been here long, Quan?

79
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,042
You're always late

80
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:44,042
I'm  busy

81
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:46,417
Busy with what?

82
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:50,500
Drinking tea, eating, practicing

83
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,750
What else?

84
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,292
This tea smells nice

85
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:00,292
I'm  talking about you

86
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,332
Have you ordered yet?

87
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:04,375
l got something to discuss with you

88
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:05,917
Let's eat first and then we'll talk

89
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,207
This just came out of the oven! Try it...

90
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,792
Heard that you had a duel with Master Liu

91
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,542
and had beaten him quickly. ls that true?

92
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,582
Who told you that, Lin?

93
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,542
My brother

94
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:22,125
Should've told me earlier. I'm  his disciple now!

95
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,707
But you've been a disciple of every master

96
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,125
Was the duel private, Brother lp?

97
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,500
We have things to discuss. Leave us for now

98
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,875
Then l won't disturb your private conversation

99
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,125
Good!

100
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,750
Morning, Master! Morning

101
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:54,500
Morning

102
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:55,250
Master

103
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,457
Heard that you were beaten by Ip Man

104
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:58,875
Everyone in Fo Shan knows about it now

105
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:00,292
Nonsense!

106
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,042
Yuan at the restaurant

107
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,667
Everything is costly in Fo Shan these days

108
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:07,832
So what?

109
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,417
That means the economy is good in Fo Shan

110
00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:14,750
Everybody can afford to spend money

111
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:16,625
ls that so?

112
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:20,167
Clothing is the most important in our daily lives

113
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:25,707
There will be lots of demand forfuture clothing

114
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:29,832
I'll open a cotton mill to provide cotton for them

115
00:10:33,707 --> 00:10:35,000
l want you to be my partner

116
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,667
l don't know anything about business

117
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:39,417
But l do

118
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,957
I'm  not in need of money

119
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:44,582
Who's Yuan? Show yourself!

120
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:46,000
l am

121
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,875
You rascal. You ruined my reputation

122
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,750
l must teach you a lesson!

123
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,292
Master...

124
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:58,667
He's my brother. Let's talk

125
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:00,332
Calm down. Okay, Master?

126
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,667
Your brother? He ruined my reputation

127
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,042
He said l was beaten by Ip Man

128
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,167
What's gonna happen to my martial club?

129
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,042
Who will want to be my disciples?

130
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:11,292
Apologize!

131
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,417
l didn't do anything wrong. l told the truth!

132
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:16,375
You're bullshitting again! You... Master...

133
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:19,457
Master Ip is upstairs. Seek him out if you have guts!

134
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,125
What? Go!

135
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:25,332
Take it easy, Master...

136
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,707
Master...

137
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:30,625
Don't be angry, Master

138
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,707
I've been wronged, Master lp

139
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,167
Master...

140
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,000
Please tell everybody

141
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:39,417
you've defeated Master Liu in a duel

142
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:48,707
Master lp...

143
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,542
You got to clear my name

144
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:55,332
You liar, why're you bothering Brother lp?

145
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:57,792
I'm  no liar

146
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:00,167
l sawthe duel when l was picking up my kite

147
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:04,417
Your kite was cut and fell into Brother Ip's house

148
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:08,667
You saw the whole duel between the two masters

149
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,582
lsn't that too much of a coincidence?

150
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:11,875
That's exactly what happened

151
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,167
Even if it's true, you shouldn't have told everyone

152
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,500
You're not supposed to admit to certain things

153
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,707
What's wrong with admitting to the truth?

154
00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:18,042
That might cause embarrassment for others

155
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,042
What embarrassment? I don't know so much

156
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,582
This is embarrassment!

157
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,042
You don't need to do that, Lin

158
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,292
Why're you laughing? You think I'm invisible?

159
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:35,332
Captain... it's no big deal

160
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:36,167
What no big deal?

161
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:38,250
Leave! Don't you leave!

162
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:39,417
Captain, it's no big deal

163
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:41,957
l saw everything. I'm  warning you...

164
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,875
I'll nab whoever that causes trouble on my turf

165
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:48,207
l didn't cause any trouble

166
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:51,542
Someone ruined my name. I'm  here to claim justice

167
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:53,832
What justice? I am justice

168
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,125
You hooligans are fighting all the time

169
00:12:58,582 --> 00:12:59,832
What age are we in now.

170
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,375
Still talking about martial arts?

171
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:04,500
We're talking about arms and guns!

172
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,750
Guns. Got it?

173
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,542
You know, Captain Li...

174
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,792
We martial artists are energetic

175
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,250
Sometimes we might be a bit too loud

176
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:40,042
But that doesn't mean we're not civilized

177
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:45,042
We're civilized folks. Please don't pull the gun

178
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,792
Cut me some slack

179
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:50,500
Lin, set a table for Captain Li. It's on me

180
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,957
Yes... Captain Li, this way please

181
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,042
What you looking at? Get lost

182
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,667
Don't look Don't look... Get out of the way

183
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:57,832
Please

184
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:02,792
Master Liu

185
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:05,082
As you please

186
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,417
Why so secretive?

187
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:15,582
I'm  really not good at business

188
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,582
Take this to set up the mill.
Pay me back if you make a profit

189
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:26,832
lt'll be a while before l can repay you

190
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:28,707
Take your time

191
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,957
Another request: take my son as your disciple

192
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:37,167
There're so many martial club masters. Ask them

193
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,167
None of them is better than you

194
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:41,667
We're similar

195
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:43,375
Brother lp

196
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:44,582
Lin

197
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,125
Brother Quan

198
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,125
l learnt some new moves. Practice with me

199
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,875
You got so much time. You found your brother?

200
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,167
Let him be

201
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,292
He'll come back once he spent all his money

202
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:57,875
Let's try

203
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,542
Dad, did Uncle Ip agree?

204
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,917
Let's go watch over there

205
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:11,207
You draw very well, Zhun

206
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:13,082
What new moves have you learnt? Let's see

207
00:15:14,457 --> 00:15:16,167
Brother lp, my master says

208
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,082
this move is offense and defense all in one

209
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:19,667
Attack while defending. Defend while attacking

210
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:22,292
Aren't they the same?

211
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Go away, ignorant kid

212
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,832
Here l come

213
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:40,332
This move attacks the midrib

214
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:43,125
Stop reciting mantra. Hit your target

215
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,250
Mom, I'm  done with my drawing

216
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:48,957
So beautiful. Show it to Dad

217
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,042
Hit to disperse. Disperse while hitting

218
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:53,707
My last move was "disperse while hitting"...

219
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:54,792
Dad, look

220
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,125
Wait. I'm not free at the moment

221
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:57,625
You don't get it? No

222
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:58,792
Come again if you don't get it

223
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,917
Try again

224
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:04,500
Dad doesn't want to see it

225
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,417
There you go What?

226
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:15,000
That was "disperse while hitting" Once more, Master lp

227
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,332
l couldn't see clearly

228
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:17,917
See?

229
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,542
You guys fight every day. Aren't you tired?

230
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,582
You okay, Brother lp?

231
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:34,625
Sorry, Mrs lp

232
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,750
Goodbye, Mrs lp

233
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,625
l wasn't talking about you

234
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,707
No, there're things to take care of at the mill

235
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,167
Yao

236
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,582
l gotta go, Uncle lp

237
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,417
Okay, see you next time

238
00:16:57,457 --> 00:16:58,667
Bye, lp

239
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:06,041
Talk to me if you're not happy

240
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,208
No need to throw a tantrum

241
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,958
Okay, please take a look at your son's drawing

242
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,916
Spend more time with him instead of your pals

243
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,791
Let's go inside, okay?

244
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,500
Go

245
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Brother

246
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,875
Where's the martial club street?

247
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:52,791
Martial club!

248
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,666
Go straight ahead

249
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:28,166
One, two...

250
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,333
Which martial club should be challenge first, Bro?

251
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,750
One... two!

252
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,083
One...

253
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,208
Back!

254
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,250
You teach martial arts here?

255
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,250
Come in if you wanna learn

256
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,083
Who's the patriarch?

257
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,666
l am

258
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,375
My name is Jin

259
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,333
l come here as Fo Shan is famous for martial arts

260
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,750
l'd like to practice with Fo Shan's martial artists

261
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,125
Practice?

262
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,333
Yes!

263
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,708
Provocation rather?

264
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm  obliged

265
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,500
Okay!

266
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,083
Stand aside

267
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,166
See how I'll beat these out-of-towners!

268
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,416
Not here. Stand over there

269
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,416
What about it?

270
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,583
Wait and see!

271
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,416
Very good!

272
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,166
Where's your master?

273
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,000
Here!

274
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,333
You wanna hack me to death?

275
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,375
Our master is not here

276
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:55,166
Weather is so treacherous in Fo Shan these days

277
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,375
Let me

278
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,875
What are you drawing, Zhun?

279
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,791
He's ignoring you. Spend more time with him

280
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,666
Okay

281
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,041
So early, Lin?

282
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,250
Yes

283
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,041
I'm  not here to fight. Just a few words

284
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,166
What's the matter?

285
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,125
Some out-of-towners are provoking all the clubs

286
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,875
Their kung fu is too good for all the masters

287
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,583
Can you look into that if you can?

288
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,000
That good?

289
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,166
Yes

290
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,375
l gotta go, Mrs lp

291
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,291
Hang in there, Master Liu!

292
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,541
We depend on you, Master Liu!

293
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,583
Damn it

294
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,333
No one in Fo Shan knows martial arts at all

295
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,208
l thought everyone was

296
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,666
lt turns out you are just bums

297
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,833
You can't even fight, let alone defend yourselves

298
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,583
Brothers, our efforts have not been wasted

299
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,791
Nobody in Fo Shan knows martial arts

300
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,583
We'll be rich this time

301
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,291
Brothers, let's keep it up

302
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,875
We open a club here to showthem our might

303
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,500
We will be No.1 in Fo Shan!

304
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:54,750
You think you're good by beating a few nitwits

305
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,500
Wait till you beat the best

306
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,416
Who's the best in Fo Shan?

307
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,958
lp Man, of course!

308
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:10,583
Go!

309
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,041
Come with us!

310
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,333
See how we shall defeat Ip Man

311
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,791
Dad, there're lots of people outside

312
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,875
What can I help you?

313
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Sir...they...

314
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:50,833
Are you Ip Man?

315
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm Jin. Heard that Fo Shan's famous for kung fu

316
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,875
l understand, Master Jin. I understand

317
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,916
You bring a crowd here to challenge me to a duel?

318
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,125
Of course

319
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,791
We're opening a club here to show our might

320
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,166
To open a martial club...

321
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:09,541
you need a good site. No need to fight with me

322
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,416
Please leave!

323
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,958
Uncle

324
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:19,416
lp Man!

325
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:24,291
Don't dillydally. Are you scared?

326
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:29,375
You think our house is a martial club?

327
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,375
Who's going to fight with you? Get lost!

328
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,791
You heard that. l won't fight with you

329
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,541
Please leave immediately

330
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,958
l heard Wing Chun was invented by a woman

331
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:41,000
That suits you just right

332
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,958
Are you afraid of your wife, lp?

333
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,166
No men are afraid of their wives

334
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:49,583
There're only men who respect their wives

335
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:54,500
Don't worry, Mrs lp. l won't beat him to death

336
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:59,916
If you fear he'll lose, I'll use only one hand

337
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,291
lf that's not enough, l can use no hands at all

338
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,875
Fight with him, Master lp! Beat him up!

339
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:09,791
I'm  too disappointed by Fo Shan. Damn it!

340
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:10,916
So many martial artists but none of them good

341
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,666
Shut up!

342
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,708
Don't break my things

343
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,875
Get out of my way!

344
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:35,458
You rascals

345
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:36,625
You come at the right time

346
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:39,875
This place is small. Please get outside

347
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,250
and close the door on your way out

348
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,000
You have to redeem our honor

349
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,583
Ask them to leave. Hurry up!

350
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,666
Can l just watch?

351
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,583
Get out

352
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:02,958
Hurry up! Get out!

353
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,125
Get out! Get out!

354
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,083
Wing Chun, Ip Man

355
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:19,458
l really wanna see...

356
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:24,500
how a man can fight like a woman

357
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:30,833
Good kung fu does not depend on age or sex

358
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,000
but on how well you fight. You will know later

359
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:13,083
I'll pay!

360
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:15,458
Good!

361
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:34,291
I'll pay!

362
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,708
Dad, Mom said if you don't start fighting

363
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:45,833
everything in the house will be broken

364
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,208
Okay

365
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,000
Little rogue

366
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,916
Mind you language

367
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:32,625
Bro...

368
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:33,958
Bro...

369
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,666
You all right, Master

370
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,416
I'm  fine!

371
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:12,541
How about that, Master

372
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,541
My kung fu isn't too bad, eh?

373
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:15,708
That's enough

374
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:20,500
My northern boxing has lost to your southern one

375
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,750
No, it's not a matter of northern or southern style

376
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,500
The problem is you

377
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:35,583
So who won?

378
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,833
Look how depressed he is. He must have lost

379
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,541
Get lost! Go back to your hometown!

380
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:45,708
Get lost, you out-of-towners!

381
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:50,958
Master! You fought very well, lp!

382
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:54,125

l was just lucky...

384
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:58,166
Don't be modest. You are Canton's treasure!

385
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,791
Thank you

386
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:05,750

391
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,541
How can that be?

392
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:14,833
You're running a business

393
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,000

How are you, Master lp?

404
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,333
That isn't bad at all

00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,833
Yes, this is the best in our shop

406
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:36,875
Really?

407
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,333
It's our honor if it can be placed in your house

00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:41,458
Thank you

409
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,416
What's the occasion?

410
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,333
Uncle Man. Auntie

411
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,958
You plan on opening a martial club...

412
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,958
why didn't you inform me first?

413
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:53,000
When did I say that?

414
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,916
Everybody in Fo Shan knows about it

415
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,291
Everybody in Fo Shan but me

416
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,166
Let me help you, Uncle Man

417
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,541
Please accept me as your disciple, Master lp

418
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,583
Master. Madam

419
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:09,625
Bro

420
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,416
You must be the one spreading the rumor

421
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,291
Keep order for me

422
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,541
Come. Go yourself

423
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,500
l don't care. Yao has to be your first disciple

424
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:24,166
Come on. You've known me long enough

425
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:25,750
l don't like having disciples

426
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,500
Be quiet

427
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:29,041
Stay in order

428
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:33,750
Stay in order and hail: Master lp! Master lp...

429
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:49,583
Master lp! Master lp...

430
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,541
On July 7, 1937, the Marco Polo Incident broke out.
Japan invaded China

431
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:04,500
robbing its people of their livelihood and causing
rampant starvation all over the country.

432
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,958
In October, 193
Fo Shan was occupied by the Japanese army

433
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:02,625
...who destroyed factories, infrastructures and
buildings.

434
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:07,333
The population of Fo Shan shrunk
from more than 300,000 to just over 70,000.

435
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:12,250
Only a dozen factories in the whole city
remained in operation still.

436
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:25,583
 Ip's residence was also confiscated and
turned into the headquarters the Japanese army.

437
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:29,500
 Ip's family was rendered homeless,
living an abject existence.

438
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,750
Cheng, I'll step out for a sec. Will be right back

439
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,125
Wait

440
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:49,791
It's cold outside. Wear a jacket

441
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,958
Hurry up. Me this side, you that side

442
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,791
Be careful, Zhun. Don't hurt others

443
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,125
I'll give you more, Master lp

444
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:34,583
Thank you

445
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:37,416
Don't push! One by one

446
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,541
Don't push

447
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,458
One by one

448
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:46,625
You get out of the way!

449
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:07,000
The mill may be old but it's still productive

450
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,166
Fo Shan is very chaotic these days

451
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:16,875
You left already. Why did you come back?

452
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:19,791
Who's going to feed the workers otherwise?

453
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,625
All my money is invested in this mill

454
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,375
l can't pay you back for now

455
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,708
Don't worry. l almost forgot

456
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,500
No, I'll consider you a shareholder then

457
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,708
Let me calculate...

458
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,916
you should have ten percent shares

459
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,333
It's really unnecessary

460
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:41,708
Stay and help out, now that you own it too

461
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:44,958
Uncle lp

462
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,125
Yao

463
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,958
You'll be helping out? That's great!

464
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,958
Everyone will be lively under your leadership

465
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,250
And l can watch you practice

466
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,583
lp, stay for lunch. It's lunchtime for the workers

467
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,750
Yes, let's have lunch together

468
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,416
No, thanks

469
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,958
I'm  not free. Next time

470
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:04,291
Goodbye

471
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:17,375
Dad, why didn't you ask Uncle Ip to stay?

472
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,333
He doesn't like to owe people favors

473
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:31,208
Dad, you used to practice martial arts, right?

474
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:33,208
Why did you stop?

475
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:35,916
l get hungry when l exercise

476
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,041
So l need to exercise less, okay?

477
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:42,125
Got it. l won't play outside from now on

478
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:46,166
You'll only stop playing today. Go eat

479
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,166
Hurry up and eat

480
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,333
This congee is a bit too thick

481
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,375
But you need to eat some

482
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:09,458
Be careful it's hot

483
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,041
How much rice is left at home?

484
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,333
Don't worry

485
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:31,375
I've pawned everything worth pawning

486
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:36,416
l am strong. l can look for a job

487
00:41:36,791 --> 00:41:37,750
It's not the end of the world

488
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,833
You look for a job?

489
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,416
l didn't need to work. But it's different now

490
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:47,750
There's always a first time

491
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,583
We have enough people here

492
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:56,291
We don't need to hire more. Sorry

493
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,166
Boss, are you hiring?

494
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,500
No

495
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:03,750
Thank you

496
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:09,791
You want to hire me, Boss...

497
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,125
Boss...

498
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,916
You, you, you... Come up here...

499
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,166
You want to hire me, Boss...

500
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:16,666
Here

501
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,166
You're looking for a job, Master lp?

502
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:23,375
Come, come up...

503
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,125
Thank you

504
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,166
Brother lp!

505
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:04,750
You can't dress like that to work

506
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,291
l didn't expect to pour coals here

507
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,625
How are you, Master lp?

508
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:11,958
How are you?

509
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:14,791
How are you, Master lp?

510
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:20,000
So many martial club masters here?

511
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,500
The boss here used to practice martial arts too

512
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:27,083
That's why he likes to employ martial artists

513
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:29,791
By the way, are you still practicing?

514
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:34,000
l'd rather used my time to scrape a living

515
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:55,333
l can't finish it all. Help me, okay?

516
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,625
Eat some

517
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,083
How're your wife and son?

518
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,333
They're fine. Thank you

519
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:13,250
Did you find your brother?

520
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:15,625
l couldn't locate him since he left

521
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:17,000
Don't know if he's still alive

522
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:20,583
l don't even have the chance to say sorry

523
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:29,625
What have you lost?

524
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,625
l lost an iron box

525
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:32,875
What iron box?

526
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:34,958
Japanese solders are coming!

527
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:56,250
Dear workers

528
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:58,875
This is Colonel Sato

529
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:02,125
He appreciates Chinese martial arts

530
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:04,666
He knows Fo Shan is famous for martial arts

531
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,208
He wants to find Chinese martial artists
to fight with the Japanese

532
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,666
Would anyone want to go?

533
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:13,458
Would anyone want to go?

534
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,000
Would anyone want to go?

535
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:26,791
Master?

536
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,791
You want us to be sandbags?

537
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:36,041
There's no door, l tell you!

538
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:38,875
Airhead

539
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:41,541
Whoever that wins will get one sack of rice

540
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:48,083
Whoever that wins will get one sack of rice

541
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,458
I'll go!

542
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,416
Lin...

543
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,083
Don't get into trouble

544
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,416
I'm  going too! Me too!

545
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,208
They took all our rice. Now l can get them back

546
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:00,916
The world is fair

547
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,166
Forget it

548
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:08,125
Help me find the iron box

549
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:14,500
Let's go. It's okay. Come

550
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:16,458
Be careful

551
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:17,916
Come, let's line up

552
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:19,166
Come, come, come...

553
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,666
Anything else?

554
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:25,041
No, let's go Yes!

555
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:55,166
Master?

556
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:58,458
General

557
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:32,208
Thank you, General!

558
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,291
Got to beat them all

559
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:50,833
Let me join in the fun

560
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:56,041
They're not good enough for General Miura

561
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,833
I'll show the Chinese what Japanese kung fu's like

562
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:04,666
Find three men to fight with me

563
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:08,583
Give them rice even if they lose

564
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:10,541
Yes, sir!

565
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,291
I've done you a favor again

566
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:18,791
General Miura will fight with three of you

567
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:23,000
You can get rice whether you win or not

568
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,625
The rice is not important. l just wanna beat them

569
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:27,416
Who will be going?

570
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,041
l will...

571
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,166
Let go of me... Stop shouting!

572
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:34,000
Lin, you and you... The three of you

573
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:34,958
Okay!

574
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:36,041
You've spit blood. Stop fighting

575
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:38,708
We've lost

576
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:42,458
General, they admitted defeat

577
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:10,041
Your really wanna die?

578
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:16,875
You asshole!

579
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,625
Lin, how are you? Lin...

580
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,583
Lin...

581
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,291
Were you tired today?

582
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:55,416
Pouring coal is not tiring at all

583
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:03,125
l saw Lin today

584
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:05,333
Really? How is he?

585
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:06,666
Not bad

586
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:09,916
l didn't expect to see him again

587
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,458
Master Li, Master Hong

588
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:37,500
Master lp

589
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:39,083
Did you see Lin?

590
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,166
Lin? No

591
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:42,666
No, l didn't

592
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,291
Let's eat first

593
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,666
Lots of us received rice yesterday

594
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,500
General Miura was very satisfied.
Anybody wants to go today?

595
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:11,541
Anybody? Li...

596
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,250
Li...

597
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:14,791
Where's Lin?

598
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:18,250
Anybody wants to go?

599
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:20,250
I'm  asking you.

600
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:22,083
l don't know

601
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:25,333
Of course you do. You took him away

602
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:27,458
Anybody wants to go?

603
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,458
You'll get rice if you win

604
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:30,416
Me!

605
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:32,333
lf Master Ip is going, I'll go too!

606
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:33,666
Me too!

607
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:35,791
l wanna have a good fight with the Japanese

608
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,458
Anything else l can do?

609
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:42,041
No, you can go

610
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:12,291
Thanks

611
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,958
Can l fight three more people?

612
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:22,583
He said he wanted to fight three more people

613
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,875
That's it for me...

614
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,708
Why did you open fire?

615
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:05,125
Li! Why did you open fire?

616
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:09,083
Li! Why did you open fire?

617
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:11,541
Who let you open fire?

618
00:55:12,666 --> 00:55:18,708
He took the rice even though he's lost

619
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:21,625
so... l wanted to teach him a lesson

620
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:28,625
This place is for tournaments only

621
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:41,708
Never open fire here anymore

622
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:44,750
Got it!

623
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:53,666
Please calm down, General Miura

624
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:56,833
I'll arrange the next tournament for you

625
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:01,166
Continue!

626
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:17,250
Who else wants to fight?

627
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,291
Me!

628
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,208
Li! Open the gate!

629
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:27,416
Master... Open the gate!

630
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,875
Tell me, was Lin beaten to death?

631
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,500
Open the gate

632
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:39,625
Master...

633
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:40,500
Open the gate!

634
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,208
Please open the gate

635
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,000
l wanna fight ten people!

636
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:03,166
You crazy? Please don't

637
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:04,625
l wanna fight ten people!

638
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:14,958
He said he wanted to fight ten people

639
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:23,750
Ten?

640
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,250
Yes

641
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:30,333
Let's see how good he is

642
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:36,041
Unit 5!

643
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:39,583
Unit 1, Unit 3, Unit 5

644
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:41,500
Start!

645
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:46,416
Be careful

646
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,208
Stay back!

647
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,375
Come back again

648
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:47,500
He wants you to come back again

649
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,041
I'm  not here for the rice

650
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,875
He said... he would come back

651
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:02,875
What's your name?

652
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:04,416
He wants to know your name

653
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:13,625
I'm  just a Chinese

654
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:19,000
His name is Ip Man

655
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:52,958
Be careful in the future

656
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,833
l don't know what Miura might do

657
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:01,708
Lackey!

658
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:04,541
Why am I a lackey?

659
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:09,125
Their deaths got nothing to do with me.
I'm  just an interpreter

660
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:11,750
l need to scrape a living too!

661
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:13,291
Scrape a living?

662
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:17,333
You watch your countrymen get beaten to death.

663
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:22,708
l don't have any

664
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:24,458
You do. You have lots of it

665
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:27,125
lf you have the guts, go beat them up!

666
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:29,291
Beat as many as you can!

667
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:32,666
I'm  an interpreter, not a lackey...

668
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,625
I'm  a Chinese!

669
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,250
I'm  back

670
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,458
Daddy

671
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:35,500
You're back?

672
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:38,333
Have you been good?

673
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:39,125
Yes

674
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:40,666
Good boy

675
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,333
Are you tired today?

676
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,375
Go wash your face first

677
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:11,000
You're so good

678
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,375
l realize today I'm  useless

679
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:29,500
l can't do anything

680
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:36,125
l practiced marital arts before

681
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:39,958
But so what?

682
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:47,833
This world...

683
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:54,750
is minuscule

684
01:05:58,416 --> 01:05:59,708
I'm  so useless

685
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,041
l don't care what the world is like

686
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:08,375
l only know I'm  very happy now

687
01:06:11,125 --> 01:06:14,708
As long as you, me, and Zhun...

688
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:19,083
can stay together, everything will be okay

689
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:24,916
It's essential for a family to stay together

690
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:58,208
Get off! Get off!

691
01:06:58,916 --> 01:07:00,458
Get off...

692
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:02,500
Stand over there! On the side!

693
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:03,666
Stand over there...

694
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:30,083
Who's the boss? Come out!

695
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:35,750
l am

696
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:49,125
l just took your goods. You can buy them back

697
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,500
ls that okay?

698
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:52,666
l don't have money

699
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:56,083
Don't beat my dad anymore!

700
01:07:58,625 --> 01:07:59,583
Wing Chun?

701
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:05,916
Damn it! Wing Chun?

702
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:07,416
Don't beat him!

703
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:11,958
Do you have money?

704
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:13,375
l don't

705
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:14,125
Do you?

706
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,042
No...

707
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:17,292
I'll keep beating you till you have!

708
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:26,042
The goods haven't been sold...

709
01:08:27,417 --> 01:08:28,792
l don't have money

710
01:08:33,582 --> 01:08:35,375
Uncle lp! Uncle lp...

711
01:08:35,957 --> 01:08:38,457
Please save my dad. He's almost beaten to death

712
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:39,917
What's the matter, Yao?

713
01:08:40,042 --> 01:08:40,582
Auntie

714
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:42,375
Let me go see what happens. It's okay

715
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:55,625
I'm  very reasonable

716
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:57,875
It's fine if you don't have money now

717
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,292
I'll give you some time to raise it

718
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:02,167
As for the goods, I'll keep them for now

719
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:21,792
Master lp

720
01:09:25,042 --> 01:09:26,207
Dad, are you okay?

721
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,957
I'm  fine. Go help Uncle Fu

722
01:09:48,082 --> 01:09:49,207
How can l help?

723
01:09:51,042 --> 01:09:53,957
l thought your martial arts were impractical

724
01:09:54,582 --> 01:09:56,000
Now l know it's very useful

725
01:09:57,542 --> 01:10:00,167
l should've learnt some martial arts from you

726
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:01,875
At least l can de

727
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:06,125
Uncle lp, please stay and teach us martial arts

728
01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:09,207
so thatwe can defend myself

729
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:11,750
Master lp

730
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:16,000
You're such an expert. Please teach us

731
01:10:16,332 --> 01:10:20,207
Yes, Master lp. Please teach us

732
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:25,542
I'm  a businessman

733
01:10:27,332 --> 01:10:28,750
l know nothing other than running a business

734
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:32,250
l can't protect them, but you can

735
01:10:34,457 --> 01:10:36,875
In peaceful days, it's okay if you refused to teach

736
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:41,707
But in bad times now, shouldn't you do something?

737
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:46,625
Teaching martial arts is very costly

738
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:50,917
Are you paying their fees? You owe me again?

739
01:10:57,417 --> 01:10:59,917
Uncle lp, I'll be your first disciple

740
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,332
Dad, l wanna be taller

741
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,000
Taller?

742
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,332
Why hasn't Ip Man come back?

743
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:40,750
l... l don't know...

744
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,082
Find him

745
01:12:45,332 --> 01:12:50,332
l don't know where he is

746
01:12:50,542 --> 01:12:51,832
l don't know how to find him

747
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,417
How big is Fo Shan?

748
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,832
How difficult can it be to find him?

749
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,207
Fo Shan is indeed very big

750
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:07,917
No...

751
01:13:09,292 --> 01:13:10,207

01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:37,332

759
01:13:41,457 --> 01:13:42,250
Zhun

760
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:43,750
That way

Master

What're you here for?

765
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,292
Miura wants you to go back and fight him

766
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:02,542
Go away

767
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:05,457

Why not? What do you want?

770

What do you want?

01:14:33,042 --> 01:14:34,207

01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:54,875
How could you let Ip run away?

I'm  sorry...

779
01:15:58,167 --> 01:16:01,707
Even Colonel Sato could not stop him...

780
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:09,125
I've tried my best already...

781
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,417
Sorry

782
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,542
Shut up!

783
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:15,582
Utterly useless!

784
01:16:17,292 --> 01:16:18,417
Tell them...

01:16:22,542 --> 01:16:23,957

786
01:16:25,207 --> 01:16:25,792

Okay. They are all fine

791
01:17:06,582 --> 01:17:07,457
Master

Thank you

803
01:17:40,332 --> 01:17:40,957
It's okay

804
01:18:04,542 --> 01:18:06,167
We better leave Fo Shan as soon as possible

805
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:09,957
Quan is trying to find a solution for us

806
01:18:10,375 --> 01:18:11,292
Where shall we go?

807
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,750
Hong Kong

808
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,792
In fact, it doesn't matter where

809
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:22,582
l still have some friends in Hong Fong

810
01:18:24,792 --> 01:18:26,042
lf something happens to me...

811
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,082
What can happen to you?

812
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,792
Nothing will happen to you

813
01:18:35,542 --> 01:18:37,292
They are here again! Let's scram!

814
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,457
They are here! They are here!

815
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:05,332
ls the money ready?

816
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,167
We won't give you money!

817
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:10,250
What did you say?

818
01:19:12,542 --> 01:19:14,875
I'm  not afraid of you! You can't bully us!

819
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,332
You want me to beat you up?

820
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:26,542
Damn it!

821
01:19:27,207 --> 01:19:28,082
just beat him up!

822
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,542
Stop it!

823
01:20:31,082 --> 01:20:32,417
No wonder they dare to resist

824
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,875
They've found a bodyguard

825
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:38,457
You spurned me for opening a club in Fo Shan

826
01:20:40,207 --> 01:20:42,207
And today, you wanna mess with me again?

827
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:45,500
You wanna chase me away?

828
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,125
No one wanna chase you away

829
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:51,375
lp, have you ever been hungry every day?

830
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:55,417
Everybody is hungry nowadays

831
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:59,832
The first day l came to Fo Shan, l told myself...

832
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:02,582
l would never be hungry again

833
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,125
l will never be hungry again!

834
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:06,542
Feep beating!

835
01:21:14,832 --> 01:21:15,625
Beat them!

836
01:22:18,332 --> 01:22:20,457
Yuan, why you still idling here? Go!

837
01:22:25,292 --> 01:22:26,207
Fill them!

838
01:22:28,832 --> 01:22:29,832
Fill them!

839
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:42,792
Go

840
01:22:43,082 --> 01:22:44,792
How can we get near him?

841
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:39,957
Let's go!

842
01:23:43,582 --> 01:23:45,125
Master, you were so good!

843
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:55,917
Yuan

844
01:23:59,332 --> 01:24:00,125
Stop there!

845
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:10,125
You know what you're doing?

846
01:24:10,375 --> 01:24:12,082
l know. I'm  a robber

847
01:24:13,082 --> 01:24:14,375
You're robbing the Chinese

848
01:24:14,707 --> 01:24:16,832
l'd rather be the bully than the bullied

849
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,082
l want everyone to be scared of me!

850
01:24:21,917 --> 01:24:24,000
Your brother asked me to give this...
Don't talk about him!

851
01:24:29,082 --> 01:24:30,292
You know your brother is dead?

852
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:32,667
He's beaten to death by the Japanese

853
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:44,082
He looked for you everywhere but couldn't find you

854
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:51,042
Everyone needs to choose his own path

855
01:26:02,125 --> 01:26:02,957
Master

856
01:26:04,457 --> 01:26:07,125
That guy told Miura you're at the cotton mill

857
01:26:07,207 --> 01:26:08,667
Don't go back, ok?

858
01:26:09,667 --> 01:26:12,000
l gotta go. Remember, don't go back

859
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:49,500
Scram! Hurry up!

860
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,457


861
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:56,042


862
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,332
Don't say a word

863
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:03,707
You, come here

864
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:07,875
Where's Ip Man?

865
01:27:08,667 --> 01:27:10,582
Tell me!

866
01:27:11,667 --> 01:27:13,167
I'm  asking you!

867
01:27:13,457 --> 01:27:14,917
Hang in there. I'll figure out something

868
01:27:16,292 --> 01:27:16,957
Speak!

869
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:19,042
Speak! Speak up...

870
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:22,125
I'm  here! I'm  Ip Man...

871
01:27:22,792 --> 01:27:24,332
I'm  here... Li!

872
01:27:25,832 --> 01:27:27,207
Wait! Wait!

873
01:27:27,332 --> 01:27:29,082
Please wait!

874
01:27:29,207 --> 01:27:32,457
Li, tell Miura the workers are innocent

875
01:27:33,082 --> 01:27:34,750
Ask Miura to release them

876
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,332
l told you not to come back.

877
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:37,332
Tell him!

878
01:27:37,582 --> 01:27:38,832
Shit!

879
01:27:43,082 --> 01:27:44,000
Sato!

880
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:51,417
He dares to hit me... Can't we put him to death?

881
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,792
l know what I'm  doing

882
01:27:53,582 --> 01:27:54,707
Li Yes

883
01:27:56,457 --> 01:28:00,875
Since the day you resisted the Japanese army

884
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:04,207
you've already been a dead man

885
01:28:05,167 --> 01:28:10,125
But you're talented, you can be useful to us

886
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:20,000
So I'll give you one chance to be loyal
to the Japanese Emperor

887
01:28:20,332 --> 01:28:24,167
Teach our army Chinese kung fu

888
01:28:25,207 --> 01:28:28,667
That way, we might still spare your life

889
01:28:30,832 --> 01:28:34,082
He wanted you to teach the Japanese kung fu

890
01:28:36,332 --> 01:28:37,917
l won't teach the Japanese

891
01:28:38,917 --> 01:28:42,750
You wanna see me fight? I'll fight with you

892
01:28:50,667 --> 01:28:54,082
He said he would think about it

893
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:59,957
He wants to have a duel with General Miura

894
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,417
Take him away!

895
01:29:04,832 --> 01:29:05,707
Take him away!

896
01:29:12,332 --> 01:29:14,875
Quan, take my wife and kid away from Fo Shan

897
01:29:16,707 --> 01:29:20,750
Master lp...

898
01:29:25,707 --> 01:29:28,707
General, you really wanna fight with lp?

899
01:29:29,167 --> 01:29:30,207
Of course

900
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:32,917
He's an expert

901
01:29:33,457 --> 01:29:34,957
But he doesn't look like...

902
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:38,332
he wants to teach the Imperial Army

903
01:29:38,792 --> 01:29:42,167
He must have other motives trying to fight with you

904
01:29:42,707 --> 01:29:46,332
General, don't fight with him

905
01:29:47,042 --> 01:29:49,792
Let me simply shoot him dead

906
01:29:54,250 --> 01:30:00,500
He challenges me to a fight

907
01:30:02,332 --> 01:30:04,082
because he thinks he's better than me

908
01:30:06,707 --> 01:30:08,500
lf l refuse to accept the challenge

909
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:15,707
but shoot him instead...

910
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:24,082
isn't that the same as admitting defeat?

911
01:30:24,832 --> 01:30:27,332
Fighting with a Chinese

912
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:31,207
is not just a matter of personal honor for you

913
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:35,457
lt has to do with the national honor of our Empire

914
01:30:35,542 --> 01:30:37,707
Are you saying l will lose?

915
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:41,457
l only fear for the worst

916
01:30:41,707 --> 01:30:43,332
l will win for sure

917
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:46,500
I'll let the whole China know I've won

918
01:30:47,457 --> 01:30:50,082
Yes! l understand!

919
01:31:26,707 --> 01:31:32,667
l want you to teach us instead of killing you

920
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,792
because l appreciate your talent

921
01:31:35,917 --> 01:31:42,332
But l don't think Chinese kung fu
is better than Japanese

922
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:48,375
We will fight in front of everybody

923
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,417
That's why we need a fair tournament

924
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:57,667
You invaded our country and killed our people

925
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:03,542
Stop being hypocritical

926
01:32:07,457 --> 01:32:08,500
Excuse me

927
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,457
Let go of me! Let me go back! Let go of my mom...

928
01:32:27,582 --> 01:32:30,750
l promised Ip nothing would happen to you

929
01:32:31,332 --> 01:32:32,542
It's too dangerous to go back

930
01:32:39,792 --> 01:32:41,417
I heard the Japanese are fighting the Chinese

931
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,792
Who's fighting? Lp Man

932
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:44,500
Look, the whole place is sealed up now

933
01:32:51,917 --> 01:32:52,832
In the past...

934
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:56,375
l wished he could be with me every day

935
01:32:58,375 --> 01:33:00,667
So l always complained about his practice

936
01:33:03,292 --> 01:33:05,417
Every time he had a duel with someone...

937
01:33:06,707 --> 01:33:08,082
l would throw a tantrum

938
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:14,582
l never truly supported him

939
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
doing what he liked

940
01:33:18,457 --> 01:33:19,332
Now...

941
01:33:20,332 --> 01:33:23,417
This could be his last duel

942
01:33:26,582 --> 01:33:29,292
I fear there won't be another chance

943
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:32,957
Why don't you give me this chance?

944
01:33:33,707 --> 01:33:35,125
Why?

945
01:33:43,542 --> 01:33:44,542
General Miura says...

946
01:33:46,167 --> 01:33:47,957
For the sake of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange

947
01:33:48,667 --> 01:33:51,375
he is having a fair tournament with Master Ip today

948
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:55,375
to share their knowledge in a friendly manner,

949
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:57,750
and to bring true peace between the two countries

950
01:33:58,582 --> 01:34:00,792
Fair tournament? ls it possible?

951
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:05,582
That traitor will surely be killed by the Japanese

952
01:34:05,707 --> 01:34:07,042
That's right

953
01:34:08,207 --> 01:34:09,417
Shut up!

954
01:34:15,542 --> 01:34:16,500
Here comes Master lp!

955
01:34:27,917 --> 01:34:31,832
General Miura talked about a tournament

956
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:33,957
But l don't give a damn!

957
01:34:34,457 --> 01:34:35,625
Listen up

958
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,082
lf you win

959
01:34:40,707 --> 01:34:43,582
l will kill you

960
01:34:43,707 --> 01:34:44,582
Remember this!

961
01:34:44,667 --> 01:34:45,375
Yes!

962
01:34:48,332 --> 01:34:50,000
You better let Miura win later

963
01:34:50,792 --> 01:34:52,250
Or he won't let you live

964
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:56,332
It's more important to stay alive

965
01:34:59,832 --> 01:35:01,792
Although martial arts involves armed forces

966
01:35:02,582 --> 01:35:05,542
Chinese martial arts is Confucian in spirit

967
01:35:06,207 --> 01:35:08,832
The virtue of martial arts is benevolence

968
01:35:09,582 --> 01:35:12,792
You Japanese will never understand the principle
of treating other people as you would yourselves

969
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:15,250
Because you abuse military power

970
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:17,292
You turned it into violence to oppress others

971
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,542
You don't deserve to learn Chinese martial arts

972
01:38:51,332 --> 01:39:14,292
lp Man! Ip Man!

973
01:41:37,457 --> 01:41:41,792
lp Man refused to be subjugated by the Japanese army...

974
01:41:42,042 --> 01:41:47,375
...and used his fists to call forth
the unity ofthe Chinese people.

975
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:54,667
Assisted by his good friend Zhou Qingquan,

976
01:41:54,917 --> 01:42:00,250
the wounded Ip Man successfully
fled Fo Shan with his wife and son.

977
01:42:06,125 --> 01:42:09,292
On August 15, 1945

978
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:13,582
Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced
that Japan would surrender unconditionally.

979
01:42:13,667 --> 01:42:19,292
The Chinese finally won and
ended a war that lasted eight long years.

980
01:42:22,582 --> 01:42:25,917
In 1949, the Grandmaster Ip Man settled in Hong Kong.

981
01:42:26,417 --> 01:42:31,750
He started his first Wing Chun class at
Kowloon Hotel's Staff Association Headquarters

982
01:42:31,917 --> 01:42:35,375
turning a new leaf in his life.

983
01:42:35,832 --> 01:42:38,917
In 1967, Grandmaster Ip Man started
the Wing Chun Athletic Association to foster...

984
01:42:39,167 --> 01:42:41,625
...the spirit of Wing Chun
with a group of like-minded enthusiasts,

985
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:46,292
fulfilling the most cherished dream of his later years.

986
01:42:48,417 --> 01:42:53,417
Until now,
renowned branch of Chinese martial arts.

987
01:42:53,832 --> 01:42:59,832
The lineage of Grandmaster Ip Man's disciples has
exceeded 2 million people.

988
01:43:00,582 --> 01:43:06,707
There are lots of talented people among his disciples,

989
01:43:07,542 --> 01:43:17,750
including the most illustrious action star of all,
Bruce Lee.

990
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,069
