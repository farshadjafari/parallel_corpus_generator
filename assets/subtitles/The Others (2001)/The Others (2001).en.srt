00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,032
GRACE: Now, children,
are you sitting comforably?

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,958
Then I'll begin.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,117
This story stared
many thousands of years ago...

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,357
but it was all over
in just seven days.

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,277
All that long, long time ago...

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,356
none of the things
we can see now--

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,358
the sun, the moon,
the stars, the earh...

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,029
the animals and plants--
not a single one existed.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,957
only god existed...

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,514
and so only He
could have created them.

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,152
And He did.

12
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,597
[Screaming]

13
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,828
[Sobs]

14
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,751
[Panting]

15
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,234
[gasping]

16
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,471
[Laughter]

17
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,513
MRS MILLS : Simpson.
what a character he was.

18
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,710
I wonder
whatever became of him ?

19
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,035
MR TUTTLE: oh, I imagine
he 's dead like all the rest.

20
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,594
MRS MILLS :
Ah, those were the days.

21
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,550
[Bell rings]

22
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,511
Mr Tuttle, your hair.

23
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,590
[Lock clicks]

24
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,513
Yes ?

25
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,393
good morning, ma 'am.
we 've come about the--

26
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,830
oh, yes, of course.

27
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,074
Come in.

28
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,676
I wasn 't expecting you so soon.

29
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,634
You are... ?

30
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,193
I'm Berha Mills, ma 'am.

31
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,390
And this is Edmund Tuttle.

32
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,032
Pleased to meet you, ma 'am.

33
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,752
You must be the gardener.

34
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,030
That's right. The gardener.

35
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,914
And this young lady
is called Lydia.

36
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,315
Have you had
much experience in service ?

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,432
oh, don 't let that angel face
fool you, ma 'am.

38
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,471
She 's older than she looks.

39
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,317
Can you iron ?

40
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,550
what's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue ?

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,673
She can 't talk, ma 'am.

42
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,312
The poor little mite 's a mute.

43
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,793
oh.

44
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,319
oh, but she 's
a good little worker.

45
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,509
I can promise you that.

46
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,994
All right.

47
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,474
All right. The other girl
I had spoke too much, anyway.

48
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,114
Follow me.
Mrs Mills, you and the girl...

49
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,799
will sleep in the attic room
at the top of the stairs.

50
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,071
-And you, Mr...
- Tuttle, ma 'am.

51
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,477
You could sleep in the shed
around the back.

52
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,751
As you can see, the housework
has been rather neglected...

53
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,109
since the servants disappeared
almost a week ago.

54
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,196
You mean they just vanished?

55
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,913
GRACE: Into thin air.

56
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,110
No notice, nothing. They didn 't
even collect their wages.

57
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,913
They... they just left us.

58
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,110
MRS MILLS :
what a strange thing to do.

59
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,071
GRACE: You 'll soon find out
there are times...

60
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,476
when this house is not
exactly an ideal home.

61
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,158
Hence my adverisement
in the newspaper...

62
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,510
requesting honest,
hard-working people.

63
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,199
There 's nobody more honest
or hard-working than us.

64
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,514
Isn 't that right, Mr Tuttle ?

65
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,630
oh, aye, we 're very honest.

66
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,672
And, um, very hard-working.

67
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,715
The kitchen.

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,557
I have breakfast at 8. 00...

69
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,556
the children at 9. 00.

70
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,672
Lunch will be served at 1. 00
and dinner at 7 30.

71
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,950
MRS MILLS :
And the master, ma 'am ?

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,829
The master went off to war...

73
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,677
a year and a half ago.

74
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,508
I've had no news
since the war ended.

75
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,959
which of you does the cooking?

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,275
MRS MILLS :
I'm so sorry, ma 'am.

77
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,311
which of you does the cooking?

78
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,157
You 'll notice what I'm doing.

79
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,590
In this house,
no door must be opened...

80
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,676
without the previous one
being closed first.

81
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,280
It is vital
that you remember this.

82
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,276
It's not as easy
as it may seem.

83
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,278
There are 1 5 different keys
for all of the 50 doors...

84
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,596
depending on which area of
the house you 're in at the time.

85
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,108
Mrs Mills,
from tomorrow onwards...

86
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,515
I will be leaving
a set of keys in your charge.

87
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,959
Yes, ma 'am.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,877
The music room.

89
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,150
That old piano was already here
when we moved in.

90
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,159
Please do not let
the children thump away on it.

91
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,838
It sets off my migraine.

92
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,351
Silence is something that we
prize very highly in this house.

93
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,960
That is why you will not find
a telephone, a radio...

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,116
or anything else
that makes a racket.

95
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,310
oh, we don 't have
electricity, either.

96
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,590
During the war, the germans
kept cutting it off...

97
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,108
so we learned to live
without it. Let's continue.

98
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,674
Ma 'am, there 's no need
to show us the whole house.

99
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,869
GRACE: Yes!.

100
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,878
Yes, there is.

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,434
Most of the time,
you can hardly see your way.

102
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,277
It's often difficult
to make out...

103
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,392
if there is a table, a chair,
a door, a sideboard...

104
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,319
or one of my children
playing hide and seek.

105
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,318
what do you mean, ma 'am ?

106
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,272
Perhaps I should introduce you
to the children.

107
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,588
[Lock clicks]

108
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,870
Mr Tuttle,
you can see to the garden now.

109
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,114
You 'll find tools in the shed.

110
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,752
Yes, ma 'am.

111
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,234
You two can star closing
the curains.

112
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,872
All of them.

113
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,472
Come.

114
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,036
I'll wake them.
You wait here.

115
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,230
whatever you do,
don 't open the curains.

116
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,595
wakey, wakey.

117
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,791
: Now, come on.

118
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,593
Eyes closed, hands together.

119
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,552
CHILDREN:
Let it be, at light of day...

120
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,716
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

121
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,035
Blessed be the Virgin pure...

122
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,071
whom I greet with faith
too shor.

123
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,190
Jesus, Mary, spotless rose...

124
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,357
keep us till this day
doth close.

125
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,595
:
They're still half asleep.

126
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,076
MRS MILLS :
what sweet little children.

127
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,317
well... what do you say?

128
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,316
How do you do ?

129
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,191
How do you do ?

130
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,550
How do you do, children ?

131
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,272
My name is Mrs Mills...

132
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,357
but you can call me
Berha if you like.

133
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,152
what are your names ?

134
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,794
-Anne.
-Nicholas.

135
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,038
Anne and Nicholas.
what pretty names.

136
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,833
ANNE: Are you going to be
our new nanny?

137
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,757
Mm-hmm.

138
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,070
Yes, my dears.
I'm your new nanny.

139
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,838
It's time for their breakfast.

140
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,871
Lydia, go to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

141
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,592
[Keys jingle]

142
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,233
The doctors were never able
to find a cure.

143
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,157
For what?

144
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,430
Their condition.

145
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,792
The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

146
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,070
They are photosensitive
and must never be exposed...

147
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,395
to any light
much stronger than this.

148
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,590
otherwise,
in a matter of minutes...

149
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,392
they will break out
in sores and blisters...

150
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,557
and begin to suffocate.

151
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,079
It would eventually be fatal.

152
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,350
MRS MILLS : good heavens.

153
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,998
I don 't like this toast.

154
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,598
oh ? why not?

155
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,710
It tastes funny.

156
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,637
I liked it better before.

157
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,832
That's because before,
somebody else made it.

158
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,996
when are they coming back?

159
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,478
They're not coming back, child.

160
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,353
Just like Daddy.

161
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,789
Daddy is coming back, though.

162
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,719
Mrs Mills, our father's
fighting in a war in France.

163
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,113
NICHOLAS : It's the world war.

164
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,957
I know, but he 's in France.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,118
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

166
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,550
Are you going to leave us, too ?

167
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,876
of course not!

168
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,638
why should I leave you?

169
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,636
The others
said they wouldn 't...

170
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,591
but they did,
and then it happened.

171
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,517
Be quiet!

172
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,710
what do you mean, Anne ?
what happened?

173
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,799
Mummy went... mad.

174
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,513
-Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

175
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,437
-No, it didn 't!
- Yes, it did!

176
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,550
GRACE: Be quiet.

177
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,232
what's going on ?
I want those plates empty...

178
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,475
in less than a minute.
Is that clear?

179
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,790
Mrs Mills, would you
come outside a moment?

180
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,796
I'd like a word with you.

181
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,913
Yes, ma 'am.

182
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,439
The postman usually
comes every wednesday.

183
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,879
But I just checked
the letter-box...

184
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,115
and this week he hasn 't.

185
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,071
I'm afraid
I don 't follow, ma 'am.

186
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,951
This letter
should have been collected...

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,560
and delivered to
the newspaper five days ago.

188
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,999
It's an adverisement
for servants.

189
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,234
Since it was never published...

190
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,874
would you explain
what you 're doing here ?

191
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,718
oh, I understand.

192
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,718
Ma 'am, that's what
I was going to say to you...

193
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,193
when you opened the door to us.

194
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,629
The truth is
that we just come by...

195
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,875
on the off chance.

196
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,433
A big house like this...

197
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,948
is always in need of someone
who knows the ropes.

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,798
You 've served in a house
like this one before ?

199
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,354
This may come as a surprise
to you, ma 'am, but...

200
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,029
we, in fact,
used to work here.

201
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,349
Here ?

202
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,678
oh, now,
'twas a few years ago.

203
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,553
If you don 't mind
my saying so, ma 'am...

204
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,229
they were the best years
of my life.

205
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,477
That's why we come by,
because this house...

206
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,351
means a lot to us.

207
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,233
Perhaps I'd best show you
our references, ma 'am.

208
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,953
No, no, no. Don 't bother.
There 's no need.

209
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,070
So you say
you know the house well?

210
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,475
MRS MILLS :
Like the back of my hand.

211
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,512
That is assuming the walls
haven 't sprouted legs...

212
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,471
and moved in the meantime.

213
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,557
GRACE: The only thing
that moves here is the light.

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,992
[Sighs]
But it changes everything.

215
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,994
It's rather difficult,
to say the least.

216
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,239
one might
almost say... unbearable.

217
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,750
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

218
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,995
oh, yes, ma 'am.

219
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,600
I don 't like fantasies.

220
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,915
Strange ideas.
Do you know what I mean ?

221
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,918
I think so, ma 'am.

222
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,748
My children sometimes
have strange ideas.

223
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,473
But you mustn 't pay
any attention to them.

224
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,398
Children will be children.

225
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,715
Yes, of course, ma 'am.

226
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,550
All right. You can stay.

227
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,554
Thank you very much, ma 'am.

228
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,630
It did happen.

229
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,038
NICHOLAS : "The Roman governor
tried to make them...

230
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,832
"change their minds
afterwards... "

231
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,031
"To make them change
their minds. " Full stop.

232
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,991
- "Afterwards... "
-Mm-hmm.

233
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,553
"He ordered them
to be beaten.

"But Justus and Pastor,
far from being afraid...

235
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,034
"rejoiced and showed themselves

"when he saw this...

237
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,557

[Snickers]

241
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,838
what do you find so amusing?

242
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,279
well...

243
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,197
well, what?

244
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,629
Those children
were really stupid.

245
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,636
why?

246
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,398
Because they said
they only believed in Jesus...

247
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,000
and then
they got killed for it.

248
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,190
And what would you have done,
deny Christ?

249
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,639
ANNE: well, yes.

250
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,511
Inside I would have
believed in him...

251
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,279
but I wouldn 't have told
the ROMANS that.

252
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,791
Is that what you think, too,
Nicholas ?

253
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,715
I see.

254
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,150
So you would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

255
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,432
You 'd have saved your heads
from the ROMANS, that's true.

256
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,118
But what would have
happened afterwards ?

257
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,309
when ?

258
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,510
In the next life.

259
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,596
The one waiting for us
after we die.

260
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,517
where would you have gone ?

261
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,709
Ahh.

262
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,273
where, Nicholas ?

263
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,799
To the children 's limbo.

264
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,717
GRACE: what is
the children 's limbo, Anne ?

265
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,796
one of the four Hells.

266
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,193

GRACE: No. Let him answer.
which are ?

270
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,160
There 's the Hell
where the damned go...

271
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,156
then there 's Purgatory...

272

Yes.

273
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,112
And the bosom of Abraham
where the just go...

274
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,832
and limbo where children go.

275
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,199
At the centre of the earh.

276
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,152
where it's very, very hot.

277
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,679
That's where children
go who tell lies...

278
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,711
but they don 't just go
there for a few days.

279
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,113
oh, no.

280
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,709
No, they're damned. Forever.

the end of eternity.

Close your eyes
and try to imagine it.

Forever.

286
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,876
Pain... forever.

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,197
I'm getting dizzy. Heh.

288
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,196
:
Now do you understand...

289
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,198
why Justus and Pastor
told the truth ?

290
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,673
[Sighs] All right.

291
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,156

293
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,152
:
You most cerainly cannot.

294
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,553
First you 're going
to read the lesson...

295
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,670

to learn it by hear.

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,869
All of it?

297
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,114
Any more protests...

298
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,628
and there 'll be
no playing at all today.

299
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,070

study in separate rooms.

if we 're separated!

used to this house by now.

what if we see a ghost?

304
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,352
Has your sister been telling you
one of her stories ?

305
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,072
I haven 't told him anything!

306
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,519
If you see a ghost
you say "Hello "...

307
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,959
and continue on studying.

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,070
-Come to the music room.
- why me ?

309
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,997
Because I say so!
Now come on.

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,789
No.

356
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,876
I think
I've finished here, ma 'am.

357
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,911
If you 'll excuse me,
I think I'll go...

358
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,394
and see if Mr Tuttle
needs a hand.

359
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,153
[Door closes]

[Child sobbing]

362
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,593
Nicholas!

363
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,038
Nicholas, I'm coming!

364
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,114
oh!

365
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,796
-Nicholas ?
- what's the matter?

366
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,989
why were you crying?

367
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,554
I wasn 't crying.
I was reading.

368
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,558
But I just heard you...
Anne!

369
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,674
[Door closes]

370
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,472
[Child sobbing]

371
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,594
Anne!

372
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,231
Anne ?

373
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,111
ANNE:
I haven 't learned it yet, Mummy.

374
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,675
-Are you all right?
- Yes.

375
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,678
- why were you crying?
-I wasn 't.

376
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,269
I just heard you a moment ago.

377
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,231
There 's no need
to feel ashamed, darling.

378
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,508
I don 't.

379
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,835
If I'd been crying,
I'd tell you.

380
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,916
oh, really.
So I imagined it, did I?

381
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,235
No. It was that boy.

382
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,111
: what boy?

383
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,593
Victor.

384
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,870
who 's Victor?

385
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,151
The boy that was here
a moment ago.

386
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,997
I told him to let me study...

387
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,110
but he wouldn 't stop crying.

388
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,991
I think he 's a spoiled brat.

389
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,156
He said we 'd have
to leave the house.

390
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,670
GRACE: oh, did he, now?
And why was he crying?

391
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,312
Because he doesn 't
like this house...

392
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,477
but he has to live here.
His father's a pianist--

393
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,875
-His father's a pianist?
- Yes.

394
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,117
I already told him he 's not
allowed to touch the piano.

395
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,309
He isn 't, is he, Mummy?

396
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,793
[Sighs]

397
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,070
So, you 've spoken
to his father as well?

398
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,917
ANNE: No, only with Victor.

399
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,359
His father's with the others
in the hall.

400
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,675
I've just come from the hall.
There 's no one there.

401
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,238
They must've gone upstairs.
They're viewing the house.

402
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,875
That'll do, Anne!
That's enough!

403
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,148
Now why were you crying?

404
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,519
It was Victor!

405
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,994
-So where is he now?
-He went out through there!

406
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,553
would you mind
telling me how a boy...

407
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,398
can get in and out
of this room if it's locked?

408
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,197
[gasps]

409
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,437
GRACE: I thought
I made myself quite clear.

410
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,879
No door is to be opened...

411
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,638
without the previous one
being closed first.

412
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,796
Is that so hard to understand?

413
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,831
This house is like a ship.

414
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,836
The light must be contained
as if it were water...

415
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,872
by opening and closing
the doors.

416
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,751
My children 's lives
are at stake!

417
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,949
MRS MILLS : But, ma 'am--

418
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,560
Do not argue with me!
Be quiet!

419
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,478
which was the last of you
to enter that room ?

420
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,748
Lydia ?

421
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,398
She hasn 't got a key.
I already told you that.

422
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,396
That leaves you, then.

423
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,919
But I was in the hall
the whole time.

424
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,393
And then I went out
into the garden.

425
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,634
You saw me with your own eyes.

426
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,877
I hope you are not suggesting
that it was me!

427
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,150
Do you think that
I would overlook such a thing...

428
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,237
and endanger
the life of my own daughter?

429
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,351
[Fire crackling]

430
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,710
NICHOLAS : You 're not supposed
to read at the table.

431
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,954
ANNE: oh, really?

432
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,719
who 's going to tell Mummy?
You?

433
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,839
or perhaps you?
[Giggles]

434
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,795
Did you really see a boy?

435
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,478
Yes. He 's called Victor.

436
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,477
Is he a ghost?

437
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,750
Don 't be stupid.
Ghosts aren 't like that.

438
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,597
what are they like ?

439
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,995
I've told you
a thousand times.

440
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,032
They go about in white sheets
and carry chains.

441
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,355
-How do you know?
-Because I've seen them.

442
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,868
They come out at night.

443
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,990
Fibber. where ?

444
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,712

[Laughs]

447
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,028
- You 're stupid.
-Not half as much as you.

448
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,150
I don 't believe
you saw that boy.

449
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,633
Believe what you like.

450
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,353
You 'll soon be begging us
to play with you.

451
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,509
ANNE: Nicholas!

452
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,473
NICHOLAS : Huh ? what?

453
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,034
Look.

454
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,911
why have you opened
the curains ?

455
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,916
-It wasn 't me.
- who was it, then ?

456
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,076
It was Victor.

457
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,429
He 's been doing it all night.

458
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,550
You 're lying.
I'm going to tell Mummy.

459
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,114
-So I'm a liar, am I?
- Yes.

460
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,754
Victor, come out from
behind that curain...

461
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,553
so my stupid brother
can see you.

464
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,712
Leave me alone.

465
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,716
ANNE: So you don 't want
to see him now, eh ?

466
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,273
You 're a cowardy custard.

467
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,154
Cowardy cowardy custard.

468
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,354
I'll just have
to do it myself, then.

469
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,513
ANNE: That's enough, Victor.

470
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,316
Nicholas. Nicholas.

471
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,634
Tell him to leave
the curains alone.

472
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,874
He won 't listen to me.

473
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,150
VICTOR: Stop it.
Get off my bed, both of you.

474
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,838
ANNE: This is our bed.

475

Anne, please stop
putting on that voice.

00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,948
You be quiet, cowardy custard.

478
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,117
Listen, if you don 't stop,
I'll call my mother...

479
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,559
and she 'll kick you out.

480
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,795
You don 't know my mother.

481
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,398
VICTOR:
And you don 't know my parents.

482
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,273
Anne, I'm going to tell
Mummy about you.

483
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,551
Don 't be stupid.
Can 't you see it's not me ?

484
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,831

so he knows you 're real.

00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,033
what is it?

493
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,516
She was fighting with me,
and I told her to be quiet.

494
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,869
I'm fed up.
Do you hear me ?

495
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,558
I am fed up with you!

496
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,158
I didn 't do anything!

508
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,720
Now you can ask the Virgin
for forgiveness.

509

what?
That's not what we agreed!

510
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,831
we didn 't agree anything,
young lady.

Today you 're being punished,
and you 'll do as I say.

512

You can 't make me
ask the Virgin for forgiveness.

How dare you!

514
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,272
Mummy, I won 't ask forgiveness
for something I didn 't do!

someone else was in the room!

do you remember the story
about Justus and Pastor?

Children who don 't tell
the truth end up in limbo.

That's what you say,
but I read the other day...

that limbo 's only for children
who haven 't been baptized.

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,476
"and said, 'My father... '

531
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,956
"and he said,
'Here I am, my son. "'

532
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,198
Did you look in on Nicholas ?

533
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,915
Yes, ma 'am.
The little angel is fast asleep.

534
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,190
what about Anne ?

535
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,878
Is she still on the stairs ?

536
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,639
oh, yes, ma 'am.

537
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,511
: I'd prefer to have her
where I can see her...

538
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,597
but I can 't embroider
in such poor light.

539
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,357
How long is this punishment
going to go on ?

540
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,277
It's been three days now.

541
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,833
It's up to her.

542
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,392
She 's got to learn
to swallow her pride...

543
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,749
and ask for forgiveness.

544
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,553
Anyway, it's time
she stared to read the Bible.

545
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,912
The priest will be very pleased
to hear that, ma 'am.

546
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,791
GRACE: If he ever deigns
to pay us another visit.

547
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,876
He knows perfectly well
that the children can 't go out.

548
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,239
MRS MILLS :
He told me yesterday...

549
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,033
he 'd be by
as soon as possible.

550
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,755
I'm beginning to feel
totally cut off from the world.

551
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,598
This fog doesn 't exactly help.

552
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,153
It's never lasted
this long before.

553
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,270
oh, that's true, ma 'am.

554
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,515
Even the seagulls
have gone quiet.

555
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,159
Anne!

556
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,760
Anne, I can 't hear you.

559
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,475
Incidentally, Mrs Mills, I've
had to put up with the noise...

560
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,431
of Lydia running around
above my head.

561
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,038
She 's been hurling
backwards and forwards...

562
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,071
as if there were three of her.

563
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,758
would you kindly tell her
it's not necessary...

564
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,473
to kick up quite such a rumpus
just to do a little cleaning?

565
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,239
I couldn 't bear to get
another migraine attack.

566
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,077
I'll tell her, ma 'am.

567
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,031
GRACE: Thank you.

who 's making that noise.

You tell me.

I told you
there was someone in the room...

596
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,397
and you punished me.

597
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,668

opening and closing the doors.

This is the father,
this is the mother...

this is Victor,
and this is the old woman.

what do these numbers stand for?

the most.

- Yes, ma 'am. There, now.
-Mummy!

Yes, darling. It's all right.

she 's not looking at you...

642

but she can see you.

saying "Come with me "--

No, Anne, don 't lie to me.

ANNE: Honestly, Mummy.
And she asks me things.

646

00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,793
: what does she ask you?

648
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,717
Things.

649
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,278

all the curains.

where someone could hide.

Yes, ma 'am.

00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,069
You both search the right side,
and I'll take the left.

654
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,917

in this house before.

00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,309
Don 't be stupid.
I've already told you.

659
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,873
ghosts go about
in white sheets...

660
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,514

and go "ooo. "

MRS MILLS : Now, Anne.

662
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,274
why do you make up
such stories ?

663
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,311
ANNE: I don 't.
I read them in books.

664
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,191
well, you shouldn 't
believe everything...

665
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,389
that you read in books.

666
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,919
That's what our mother says.

667
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,350
She says all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish...

668
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,277
and then she expects us...

669
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,390
to believe everything
written in the Bible.

670
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,873
And don 't you believe it?

671
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,069
I believe some things.

672
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,350
But, for example,
I don 't believe...

673
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,914
that god made the world
in seven days.

674
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,552
And I don 't believe
that Noah...

675
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,716
got all those animals
into one boat...

676
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,228
or the Holy Spirit is a dove.

677
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,475
No, I don 't
believe that, either.

678
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,192
ANNE:
Doves are anything but holy.

679
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,753

everywhere, ma 'am.

00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,478
GRACE: get rid of it.
I don 't want it in the house.

707
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,317
MRS MILLS : Yes, ma 'am.

708
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,996
Mrs Mills, it's cold.

709
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,156
why don 't you come
and sit by the fire ?

710
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,237
Thank you very much, ma 'am.

711
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,989
So... tell me about
when you worked here before.

712
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,156
Did you have
to look after children then ?

713
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,432
No, I was in charge of
organizing the housework.

714
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,040
Hmm.
were there many servants ?

715
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,834
oh, about fifteen.

716
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,074
Though in the end...

717
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,270
there were just
the three of us left.

718
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,594
why?

719
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,790
My employers moved to London.

720
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,628
They came here
less and less...

721
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,796
it being
so out of the way like.

722
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,038
So gradually the house
just became empty.

723
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,676
Everybody ends up leaving
this damned island.

724
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,871
My family left
in the summer of 1 940....

725
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,196
just before the invasion.

726
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,435
That was the last
I've heard of them.

727
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,838
ohh.

728
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,440
I don 't blame them.

729
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,870
Actually, we left, too.

730
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,592
Although, you know...

731
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,631
sometimes when
you leave a place...

732
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,037
it's like it's there
with you all the time.

733
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,629
I always felt like I
never left this house.

734
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,830
why did you leave ?

735
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,075
oh, 'twas on account
of the tuberculosis.

736
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,237
The whole area was evacuated.

737
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,589
ohh.

738
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,835
was that when Lydia went dumb ?

739
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,678
Yes, I think so...

740
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,429
though my memory's
a bit rusty these days, ma 'am.

741
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,072
what happened to her?

742
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,078
It was suddenly one day.

743
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,954
She just... stopped talking.

744
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,833
There must've been a reason.

745
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,269
People don 't just stop talking.

746
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,673
These things
are always the result...

747
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,792
of some sor of trauma.

748
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,831
Something
must've happened to her.

749
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,558
Did your employers
treat you well?

750
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,477
oh, they were always
very kind to us.

751
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,432
They treated us
just like family.

752
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,871
You know, ma 'am,
I think I will go to bed.

753
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,514
I'll never be able
to get up in the morning.

754
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,118
: off you go.

755
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,912
I'm going to stay here
a while longer.

756
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,518
Yes, ma 'am.

757
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,193
[Sighs]

758
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,829
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

759
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,148
Can you forgive me ?

760
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,073
Anne.

761
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,429
NICHOLAS : Mummy.

762
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,629
what?

763
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,989
when 's Daddy coming home ?

764
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,316
when the war's over.

765
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,396
why did he go to war?

766
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,150
I mean, nobody's done
anything bad to us.

767
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,031
Daddy went...

768
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,468
Daddy went
because he 's very brave...

769
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,476
and because
he wasn 't prepared...

770
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,910
to let the germans tell him
what he had to do.

771
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,552
NICHOLAS : why?

772
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,993
[Sobbing]

773
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,350
Charles...

774
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,391
where are you?

[Door locking]

787
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,753
Mrs Mills!

788
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,631
Mrs Mills!

789
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,359
what's the matter, ma 'am ?

790
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,836
The key to the music room,
give it to me! Quickly!

791
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,348
- what's happening, ma 'am ?
-Come on!

792
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,234
oh, my god.

793
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,952
ohh!

794
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,878
I checked that room myself.

795
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,671
It was empty.

796
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,359
Take these tablets, ma 'am.

797
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,231
They'll do you good.

798
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,397
And yet I felt as if
there was someone else there.

799
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,989
And it wasn 't human.

800
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,191
There is something
in this house.

801
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,037
Something diabolic.

802
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,513
Ma 'am...

803
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,438
Something which is not...

804
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,759
not at rest.

805
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,837
[Sighs]

806
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,440
I know you don 't believe it.

807
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,994
You don 't believe it, do you?

808
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,359
I don 't blame you.

809
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,279
I used to not believe
these things.

810
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,514
[Sighs]

811
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,950
I do believe it, ma 'am.

812
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,432
I've always believed
in those things.

813
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,630
They're not easy to explain...

814
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,272
but they do happen.

815
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,075
we 've all heard stories
of... the beyond...

816
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,953
now and then...

817
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,872
and I think sometimes
the world of the dead...

818
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,515
gets mixed up
with the world of the living.

819
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,393
But it's impossible.

820
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,670
The Lord would never allow
such an aberration.

821
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,869
The living and the dead...

822
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,833
will only meet
at the end of eternity.

823
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,474
It says so in the Bible.

824
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,829
Ma 'am...

825
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,590
there isn 't always
an answer for everything.

826
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,033
[Door opens]

827
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,112
MRS MILLS :
where are you off to, ma 'am ?

828
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,879
I'm going to the village
to pay Father McGraw a visit.

829
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,911
If he won 't come here,
then I shall go to him.

830
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,234
I shall bring him back.

831
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,316
Ma 'am, you should wait
till the weather improves.

832
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,112
:
I've waited long enough.

833
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,230
Ma 'am,
the priest told me that--

834
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,350
: I don 't care
what he told you!

835
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,436
I want him to tell me
personally!

836
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,993
He must come today!

837
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,758
MRS MILLS : But what are you
going to tell him ?

838
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,439
: That we have searched
every room inch by inch...

839
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,040
and now I need them
to be blessed.

840
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,430
MRS MILLS :
Ma 'am, please, wait.

841
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,833
Still, it's very early.

842
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,030
-Mr Tuttle.
-Morning, ma 'am.

843
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,913
I need you to search
the garden for gravestones.

844
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,154
gravestones ?

845
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,519
Yes. when my husband
bought this house...

846
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,357
we were told
there was a little cemetery.

847
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,675
I think it was over there,
amongst the trees.

848
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,869
I've not seen anything.

849
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,878
Check carefully.
It could be overgrown.

850
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,148
Yes, ma 'am.

851
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,430
I need to know if there was
a family buried here...

852
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,074
and if they had
a little boy-- Victor.

the house is haunted.

Do you think
it's safe to let her go ?

856
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,676
oh, don 't worry. The fog
won 't let her get very far.

oh, yes, the fog.

The fog, of course.

859
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,233
And when do you think...

860
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,511
we should bring
all this out into the open ?

861
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,357
All in good time, Mr Tuttle.

give you up for dead.

888
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,111
But where have you been
all this time ?

889
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,597

So different.

893
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,919

Here.

902
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,638
I want you to prepare a hot bath
and some clean clothes.

903

And something to eat.

904

we 've been very good.

Have you been good
to your mother?

when 's Daddy coming down ?

925

: Be patient, Anne.
Daddy is... not well.

926

a lot of dead men.

: Shh.

928
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,952
Mummy, when people die
in the war...

929
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,149
where do they go ?

930
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,031
oh, what a question.

931
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,755
-It depends.
-on what?

932
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,270
whether they fought on the side
of the goodies or the baddies.

933
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,788
Your father, for example,
fought for England...

934
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,831
on the side of the goodies.

935
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,108
How do you know who the goodies
and the baddies are ?

Eat your food.

00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,513
You 're not missing out
on anything.

941

You 're much better off at home
with your Mummy and Daddy...

No, I said that
there are no intruders here.

947
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,591
I don 't want to hear
another word on the subject.

948
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,108
-But you said--
- That is enough!

949

Can I say something?

-No!
- why not?

Yes.

why don 't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she 'll believe me.

There are things your mother
doesn 't want to hear.

971

She only believes
in what she was taught.

sooner or later...

Leave it to us.

1067
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,949
we know what has to be done.

1068
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,792
what do you mean by that?

1069
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,430
what do you mean
you know what has to be done ?

1070
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,232
Nothing, ma 'am.
I was just suggesting--

1071
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,033
There 's nothing to suggest.

1072
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,479
who do you think you are ?

1073
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,351
You have no idea
what has to be done.

[Softly] or do you?

1075
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,075
what are these ?

1076
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,755
The tablets
for your migraine, ma 'am.

1077
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,518
The ones you always take.

1078
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,996
Please,
I need to be on my own.

1079
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,474
Yes, ma 'am.

1080
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,911

Anne told me everything.

1084
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,957
I wish I had an explanation,
but I haven 't.

1085
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,275
At first, I thought there
was someone else in the house.

1086
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,753
Even thought there were ghosts.

1087
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,553
I'm not talking about
the ghosts.

1088
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,512
I'm talking about
what happened that day.

1089
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,078
I don 't know what
you 're talking about.

I don 't know
what came over me that day.

during the night.

to tell me to my face.

1097

They knew that I couldn 't
leave the house.

1098
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:14,398
They knew. [Sobs]

1099

01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,118
Anne, what happened?

1101
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,035
She hit me.

1102
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,390
She went mad
like she did that day.

1103
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,716
Do you remember?

1104
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,876
No.

1105
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:37,914
You must forgive me, Charles.

1106
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:41,509
Not me. The children.

1107
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,950
They know that I love them.

1108
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,309
They know I'd never hur them.

1109
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,476
I'd die first.

1110
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,439
what are you going to do ?

1111
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,278
Are you angry with me ?

1112
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,150

to say good-bye...

to my wife and children.

1114

Now I must go.

1115

go where ?

1116
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,553
To the front.

1117
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,999
No. The war's over.

1118
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,759
The war is not over.

You 're not going,
do you hear me ?

You left us once already.
You can 't go!

why?

1123
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,999
why did you have
to go to that stupid war...

1124
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,429
that had nothing to do with us ?

1125
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:34,313
why couldn 't you have
stayed here like the others ?

1126
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:35,509
The others surrendered.

1127
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,391
we all surrendered!

1128
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,671

what were you trying to prove
by going to war?

1132
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,274
Your place was here with us.

1133
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,790

But not for you.

I wasn 't enough for you.

1141

oh, dear.

1198
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:14,070
why should anyone want
to take all the curains ?

1199
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:17,874
To let some daylight
into this house, I imagine.

1200
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,992

1201
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,235

my children.

1202

why do you think that
the daylight would kill them ?

Are you mad?

1204
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,915
I told you.

1205
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,518
I already told you!

1206
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,791
The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them!

1207

Yes, but that was before.

1208

The condition could have
cleared up by itself.

1209

expose them to daylight...

how do you know
they're not cured?

they disappeared.

to find those curains...

helping me hang them...

01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,472
what happened?

1425
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,512
They made contact.

1426
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,073
All three ?

1427
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:30,998
Apparently, yes.

1428
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:34,635
The mother
and the two children.

1429
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,318
Quite interesting,
don 't you think?

1430
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,237
MRS MAPLISH: Interesting?

1431
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,952
I was scared out of my wits!

1432
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,433
Darling, calm down.

1433
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,313
No. So far, we have handled
this matter your way...

1434
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:45,952
but now you listen to me.

1435
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,309
we can 't possibly stay
in this house any longer.

1436
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:51,670
It is quite clear these beings
do not want us to live here.

1437
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,199
we don 't know anything
about them yet.

1438
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:55,037
Yes, we do!

1439
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,718
we know the woman went mad...

1440
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,479
smothered her two children,
and then shot herself.

1441
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,592
That's quite enough.
Think of our son.

1442
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,358
There 's nothing wrong
with Victor.

1443
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,073
Yes, there is!
He has nightmares.

1444
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,917
He says he has seen that girl...

1445
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,235
and even this lady
has been possessed by her.

1446
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,158
Please,
let us leave this house.

1447
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,428
All right.

1448
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:18,631
we will leave tomorrow morning.

1449
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,035
oh, thank god for that.

1450
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,630
I'll just go
and check on Victor.

1451
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,551
once again,
thank you so much for coming.

1452
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,794
MAN: A pleasure.

1453
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,637
I hope we 've been of some help.

1454
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,558
MR MAPLISH: oh, yes, of course.
Though I must admit...

1455
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,276
: At first,
I couldn 't understand...

1456
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,154
what the pillow
was doing in my hands...

1457
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,553
or why you didn 't move.

1458
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,350
But then I knew.

1459
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,991
It had happened.

1460
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,114
I had killed my children.

1461
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,754
[Inhales]

1462
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:17,953
I got the rifle.

1463
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,150
I put it to my forehead.

1464
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:26,310
Then I pulled the trigger.

1465
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,070
Nothing.

1466
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:43,196
Then I heard your laughter
in the bedroom.

1467
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:46,118
Ahh.

1468
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,513
You were playing
with the pillows...

1469
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,869
as if nothing had happened.

1470
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:58,272
And I thought
the Lord in His great mercy...

1471
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:03,997
was giving me another chance...

1472
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:08,352
telling me, "Don 't give up. "

1473
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,952
"Be strong. "

1474
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,318
"Be a good mother. "

1475
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:19,959
"For them. "

1476
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:28,749
But now...

1477
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,313
now...

1478
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,511
what does all this mean ?

1479
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,233
where are we ?

1480
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,548
MRS MILLS : Young Lydia
said the very same thing...

1481
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,070
when she realized
the three of us were dead.

1482
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,312
And that was the last time
she ever spoke.

1483
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,113
But I couldn 't tell you
that before now.

1484
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:05,716
Shall I make us
a nice cup of tea, ma 'am ?

1485
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,471
The intruders are leaving...

1486
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,750
but others will come.

1487
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,756
Now, sometimes we 'll sense them.

1488
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:19,236
other times, we won 't.

1489
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,477
But that's the way
it's always been.

1490
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,628
Ma 'am.

1491
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,320
NICHOLAS : Mummy...

1492
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,590
Daddy died in the war,
didn 't he ?

1493
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,073
GRACE: Yes.

1494
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,792
will we ever see him again ?

1495
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,673
I don 't know.

1496
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:45,316
If we 're dead, where 's limbo ?

1497
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,998
I don 't know
if there even is a limbo.

1498
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,833
I'm no wiser than you are.

1499
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:02,913
But I do know that I love you.

1500
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,633
I've always loved you.

1501
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,198
And this house is ours.

1502
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:15,797
You say it with me.

1503
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,034
This house is ours.

1504
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:18,559
NICHOLAS :
This house is ours.

1505
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,670
This house is ours.

1506
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,598
[All repeating]

1507
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,870
Mummy, look.
It doesn 't hur any more.

1508
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:57,113
No one can make us
leave this house.

1509
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:23,712
Come along, Victor.

1510
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,114
[Chain clanks]

1511
