1
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,261
Open your eyes.

2
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,564
Open your eyes.

3
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,799
Open your eyes.

4
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,102
Open your eyes.

5
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,404
Open your eyes.

6
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,639
Open your eyes.

7
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,942
Open your eyes.

8
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,143
Open your eyes.

9
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,627
Open your eyes.

10
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,504
Why tell me that dream?

11
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,971
You said I could tellyou
whatever I wanted.

12
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,940
All right. Anything else you
should tell me before we start?

13
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,037
Nothingyou don 't know.
I was about to turn 25.

14
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,708
I liked eating, sleeping,
making love, like everyone.

15
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,945
Andyou know what everyone
does when they get up.

16
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,123
OPE N Y OU R EYES

17
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,479
Where are you going?

18
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,987
Out.

19
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,885
Stop leaving messages on the alarm.

20
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,358
Why?

21
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,560
Just don't.

22
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,434
Because it pisses me off.

23
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,594
Come on, for fuck's sake.

24
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,666
- I'll slaughteryou.
- We'll see about that.

25
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:53,041
You've got three cars.
Why do we always go in this wreck?

26
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,943
Come on. I'm in a hurry.

27
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,710
Are you backing out?
I missed class for this.

28
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:01,275
I'm seeing my partners after.
Why do you think I'm dressed up?

29
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,151
So you can shout at them.
You like that.

30
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,122
I don't shout.

31
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,554
- So tell me, did you screw her?
- Screw who?

32
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,857
Whoever was there
when I rang last night.

33
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,458
I was alone last night.
Anyway, what is it to you?

34
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,331
Nothing. You can do what you want
with your life.

35
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,200
Thanks very much.

36
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,171
Let's change the subject.

37
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:27,279
- Did you screw her?
- Give me a break. I was on my own.

38
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,440
So, you did. Was it the one
you talk so much about?

39
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,450
- Who?
- That Nuria.

40
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,019
My God, I can't believe it!

41
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,091
Cesar seeing the same woman twice!

42
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,956
- She must be great in bed.
- She isn't bad.

43
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,054
Bastard! When are you going
to tell me the secret?

44
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,223
- What secret?
- The recipe for Coca-Cola.

45
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,857
- Look, the kind you like.
- Yeah. Change the--

46
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,167
What did you eat today?

47
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,508
Nothing. That's my problem.
I'm starved!

48
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,681
It's funny when you ask them
what they value most in a man.

49
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:08,481
"I like him to be intelligent,
to be honest, to be kind."

50
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,887
It's all shit! You'd have problems
ifyou were like me.

51
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,255
Not that again!
You aren't ugly.

52
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,954
Anybody would like to have
your face. You're normal.

53
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,795
- Normal. That doesn't mean handsome.
- You're handsome.

54
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,926
I'm acceptable,
when you're not beside me.

55
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,029
You're like anorexics. They insist
they're fat, and end up crazy.

56
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,666
When some girl ties you down,
the rest of us will get a chance.

57
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,575
- Yeah, yeah.
- Why not?

58
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,613
Ifyou meet the right girl--

59
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,013
She doesn't exist.

60
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,711
Shit!

61
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,652
- How did I miss that?
- God punished you.

62
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,883
You're for it.

63
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,756
- Who are you saying that to?
- To God.

64
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,861
Do you believe in God?

65
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,800
- Don't start all that shit.
- Ijust asked a question.

66
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,532
Ifyou don't want to,
don't answer.

67
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,332
I don't believe in God.

68
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,311
How do you explain
what happened?

69
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:11,645
- How do you mean?
- Your face.

70
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,312
- There is no explanation.
- I believe there is.

71
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,982
- You believe I'm mad.
- I only believe what I see.

72
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,321
You haven't let me see
your face yet.

73
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,325
And I won't.

74
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,023
Do you really think
you're a monster, Cesar?

75
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,897
- Come on, let me see.
- Stickyour hand up your ass!

76
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,803
Take it easy, brat!
I'm sick of all your stories.

77
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,807
- Leave me alone!
- I'll kick the shit out ofyou!

78
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,342
Leave me alone!

79
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,345
I can't work with you in here.
Leave us on our own.

80
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,211
On my responsibility.

81
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,079
You're just a spoiled brat who--

82
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,555
My parents are dead, asshole!

83
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,558
You made up a story
so as not to admit what you did.

84
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,534
Is that true?

85
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,030
What?

86
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,040
That you're a spoiled brat.

87
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,337
My father had a restaurant chain.
That's not my fault.

88
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,484
When did your parents die?

89
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,855
Fifteen years ago,
in an accident.

90
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:28,149
- And now you're rich.
- So they say.

91
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,493
Then why don't you want
a lawyer?

92
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,966
They say they can get me
the best.

93
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:39,060
- But they want me stuck here forever.
- Who are they?

94
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,073
My partners. They've been sucking
my blood since I was a kid.

95
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,944
Now they've got everything.
They've cut me out.

96
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,015
It wasn't them.
It was me.

97
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,112
I don't care.

98
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,522
Let's see, Cesar.
Do you know why you're here?

99
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,223
- Because I wear a mask, I guess.
- No.

100
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,227
Because you killed someone.

101
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,199
Or don't you remember?

102
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,600
- Tell me, don't you remember?
- Fuck! Stop it!

103
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,105
We must get things clear
ifyou want us to get on.

104
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,833
I don't want us to get on!

105
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,139
Is your solution to sit
in this hole and not talk?

106
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,840
- Aren't we talking now?
- After two months.

107
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,953
I've been trying
for two months.

108
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,285
- Read the reports.
- I've read them.

109
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,325
I want you to tell me,
if possible, sitting on a chair.

110
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,657
Or are you going to stay there?

111
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,661
I like the floor.

112
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,928
It's the only thing
that seems real.

113
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,436
What does everything else seem?

114
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,438
Everything else is a lie.

115
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:51,306
All this seems a lie,
including you.

116
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,675
You don't even wear a white coat.

117
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,771
- Do you think I should?
- Doctors wear them.

118
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,874
I took it off so you'd forget
I was a doctor.

119
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,350
So that you'd like me more.

120
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,854
It didn't work.
I hate the sight ofyou.

121
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,995
Now that we're friends--

122
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,895
- I've got no friends.
- Tell me what happened.

123
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,593
The sooneryou talk,
the sooner I'll go.

124
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,753
Hey! Happy birthday and all
the things people usually say.

125
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,793
Thankyou, thankyou.

126
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,961
- Where did you find her?
- In the library.

127
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,432
- She tried to steal my book.
- It was mine.

128
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,504
- Anyway, Cesar, Sofia.
- Hello.

129
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,238
Happy birthday.

130
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,069
- Thankyou.
- Your present.

131
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,441
- Thanks a lot.
- We bought it between us.

132
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,846
Then I have to thank
both ofyou.

133
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,917
Stop chatting her up
and open it.

134
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,282
- I'd rather open them tomorrow.
- Whatever.

135
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,878
- Like a drink?
- Sure.

136
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,150
I'll leave this upstairs.

137
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,503
Hello.

138
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,751
- What are you doing here?
- Happy birthday, darling.

139
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,344
Thankyou.

140
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,686
But I didn't askyou
to the party.

141
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,918
That was nice ofyou.

142
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,403
I brought you a present, too.
Why not open it?

143
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,266
No, thanks. I already know
what's inside.

144
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,275
- And last night?
- Listen, Nuria.

145
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,938
I don't like you just turning up,
much less coming into my room.

146
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,814
- Well! Do I have to apologize?
- No.

147
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,512
You have to go.

148
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,580
Right. I know what it is.

149
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,158
You don't want to be seen twice
with the same girl.

150
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,251
It would ruin your reputation.

151
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,524
- You got it in one.
- And there's someone else.

152
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,896
- Right?
- Who?

153
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,166
The brunette you were talking to
a minute ago?

154
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,796
Well, she's not bad.

155
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,200
I don't care.

156
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,711
I don't need to be seen
with you.

157
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,118
Hold me.

158
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,156
Come on.

159
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,123
A little kiss.

160
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,430
Come on.

161
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,381
Until when?
Until next Friday?

162
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,917
Can you manage a weekend
without me?

163
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,854
Excuse me. I must see
to my guests.

164
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,324
Yes, the brunette will take time.
She looks that type.

165
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,994
- That type?
- Yes.

166
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,793
The kind who can't find
your zipper.

167
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,235
- Hello.
- Hello.

168
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,741
- What did you want?
- To open this.

169
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,208
Wait.

170
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,176
I'll serve you.

171
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,075
Since when are you the waiter?

172
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,551
Don't you know I'm in catering?

173
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,847
Are you all right?

174
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,417
- Can't you tell I'm elbowing in?
- A bit.

175
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,497
I've got a slight problem.

176
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,555
- A girl's chasing me.
- You don't say.

177
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,602
- I need help to get rid ofher.
- And I'm that help.

178
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,194
Shit! There she is!

179
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,070
- Where?
- Don't look. Look over here.

180
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,701
That's it. Yes.

181
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,280
Yes, yes, yes.

182
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,282
- Here we are.
- Here we are.

183
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:31,212
Well, act as ifwe were talking about
something real interesting.

184
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,159
Nod your head, agree,
say yes.

185
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,419
You know.

186
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,429
- What a nice conversation.
- Yes.

187
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,535
- And she's coming this way.
- Fuck!

188
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,933
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, I'll guide you.

189
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,304
- Straight on.
- I don't see her.

190
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,843
Here it is.
Go right in.

191
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,278
- I'm not going in there.
- Well, I am. So long.

192
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,659
- He's in here.
- You--

193
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,123
Well, we're safe.

194
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,068
But we've got nothing
to drink here.

195
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,003
I think all you really want
is to chat with me.

196
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:24,041
Yes, that too.
First, I want to save my skin.

197
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,475
Can't you say
you aren't interested?

198
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,138
She wouldn't care.
She never gets tired.

199
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,113
- She must be feeling bad.
- Yeah.

200
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,581
Of course.

201
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,866
So you're studying drama,
like Pelayo?

202
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,597
- For now.
- Scenography?

203
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,664
- Acting.
- Really? To be an actress?

204
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,107
I am an actress.
Is that a problem?

205
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,112
Yes. Aren't you ashamed?

206
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,843
Ashamed?
Why should I be ashamed?

207
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,612
Actors aren't honest.

208
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,882
You're able to show emotions
you don't have...

209
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,550
or which, at most,
you invent.

210
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,752
Right now you could be thinking...

211
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,329
"This guy is a real drag.
How can I dump him? "

212
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:22,560
- Really?
- "And in catering. A pain in the ass."

213
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,796
But you're a good actress.
It doesn't show.

214
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,649
- Hey, Pelayo!
- I caught you.

215
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,352
- Come in.
- How's it going?

216
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,587
Great. I'm a bit out of it now.

217
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,196
Drunk, you mean.

218
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,697
Why are you in here?

219
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:58,600
Sofia was protecting me
from a female psychopath out there.

220
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,764
- She seemed dangerous.
- Yeah.

221
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,277
- What about you?
- I was drinking. Women don't chase me.

222
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,870
- We're out of drink.
- Here.

223
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,949
- Shit.
- I'll get some more.

224
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,248
For all of us.

225
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,648
Well, I guess I'll be going.

226
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,561
- Why?
- I'm drunk and don't feel well.

227
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,894
Don't be stupid.
It's just starting.

228
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:32,129
- Foryou, it is.
- Pelayo, you can't go.

229
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,205
You're my guest ofhonor.

230
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,441
You're a son of a bitch, Cesar.

231
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,205
- Why'd you say that?
- The party's full of girls.

232
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,680
I go for a piss, you start
talking to her, and--

233
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,580
What?

234
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,853
Nothing. And I look like
an asshole.

235
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,685
Tell me what's wrong.

236
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:57,319
- Why do you have to chat up Sofia?
- No one's chatting up Sofia.

237
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,362
Yeah, and I'm blind, right?

238
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,757
You're certainly drunk.

239
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,340
I'm drunk,
but I'll tell you this.

240
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,501
I like Sofia a hell of a lot.

241
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,944
She may even be
the girl of my dreams.

242
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:20,041
But if she fucks up our friendship,
she can go to hell.

243
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,450
I feel the same.

244
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,954
Sure.

245
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,097
Pelayo, where are you going?

246
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,134
- Home.
- Already?

247
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,864
- Yeah, I'm wrecked.
- I'll come with you.

248
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,463
Don't bother. You stay.

249
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,169
Are you going, too?

250
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,911
I have to get up early.

251
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,538
I can run you home later.

252
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,046
Stay on. I'm leaving you
in good hands.

253
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,457
What's wrong with him?

254
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,550
He's drunk.

255
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,162
- Is he annoyed with us?
- No.

256
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,662
You sure?

257
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,970
She doesn't look too happy.

258
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,164
Didn't you have to get up early?

259
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,845
I'm doing too much
foryou tonight.

260
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,014
- Maybe it means something.
- Yeah. That you've got a nerve.

261
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,016
It's just for a minute.

262
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,780
Long enough for my friend Nuria
to admit defeat.

263
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,355
This is my place.

264
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,654
- Don't dare laugh at it.
- Why would I laugh?

265
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,661
It's nothing special,
but it's cheap.

266
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,528
- Do you like clowns?
- They're not clowns.

267
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,970
They're mime artists.

268
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,438
Pancho!

269
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,703
- I've got a cat.
- I hate cats.

270
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,748
They're almost as false
as actresses.

271
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,908
Says the caterer.

272
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,151
How do you pay for this?

273
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,815
Do your parents help?
Do you work?

274
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,586
He's real nosy,
isn't he, Pancho?

275
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,627
I'm an arms dealer.

276
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:15,029
Fancy that! I always wanted to know
how arms dealers lived.

277
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,067
Now you do.

278
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,288
How can I explain it to you?

279
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:47,026
You wouldn't understand.
Even I don't understand.

280
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:51,727
She was making coffee
and I started snooping around.

281
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:55,705
Suddenly, I got this stupid feeling
a lot ofpeople get.

282
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,468
Wel l, I I i ke it.

283
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,945
- What didyou feel?
- That I loved her.

284
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,346
- God, I'm even embarrassed to say it.
- I d id n't hear you.

285
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,516
I said I like your place.

286
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,985
And I like yours.
Let's swap.

287
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,716
You wouldn't like it
tomorrow morning.

288
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,793
I said it because of the decor.

289
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,725
Your place is more personal.

290
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,390
- And warmer.
- Warmer?

291
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,934
- Yes.
- You think my house is cold?

292
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,197
- A bit.
- And am I?

293
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:29,000
- I don't know.
- You said my house seemed cold.

294
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,135
Ifyou're waiting for me
to list your virtues, hard luck.

295
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,541
You thinkyou're real smart.

296
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,513
- Maybe.
- Well, you're wrong.

297
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,016
I don't need you
to list my virtues.

298
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,417
No, I'm sure you know
what they are.

299
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,923
- But you'd like me to see them, too.
- So you say.

300
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,993
I'm not going
to argue about it.

301
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:53,393
- Just as well. You'd lose.
- Oh, yeah?

302
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:57,730
But I don't want to argue either.
I propose we do the opposite.

303
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,270
- We don't argue?
- We show our defects.

304
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,406
Great!

305
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,388
I hope you're being fair.

306
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,651
This is absolutely you.

307
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,162
Well, mine is finished.

308
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,038
Fuck!
That's how you see me?

309
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,305
- Did I go too far?
- Sign it.

310
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,642
Let's see mine.

311
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,185
It's lovely!

312
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,789
- It's not a caricature.
- You see.

313
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,358
You draw beautifully.

314
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,021
- I'll sell it to you.
- Miser. How much?

315
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,462
As it's you,
I'll sell it for...

316
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:02,931
a kiss.

317
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,540
That smile's going to kill me!

318
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,577
It would be wrong
ifwe did anything tonight.

319
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,713
- Why?
- Pelayo. Remember?

320
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,020
Your best friend.

321
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:29,020
He doesn't have to find out.
Besides, he'd do the same.

322
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,622
I see friendship
really matters to you.

323
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:36,131
It does. That's why
I wouldn't tell him.

324
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,500
Some people...

325
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:50,809
say that they would be happy
with a normal life span.

326
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:54,181
But "normal" means different things,
depending on--

327
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,447
What are you looking at?

328
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,421
I'm watching TV.

329
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,358
The Romans, for instance,
lived only 25 years.

330
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,893
Today...

331
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,397
that figure has tripled,
which means that--

332
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,401
- What the fuck is he on about?
- I saw this before.

333
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,437
It's about cryonization.

334
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,302
Cryo what?

335
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,773
When they freeze you
or something.

336
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,809
Like Walt Disney.

337
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,580
Wow, that's cold!

338
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,050
Hey, you!

339
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,812
There won't be a landslide.

340
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,219
It isn't dangerous. The ground
is firm here and very solid.

341
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:38,323
- Are you leaving?
- I'm going home. Here's my number.

342
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,056
But I'll call tomorrow.

343
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,667
What for?

344
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,300
All right, I won't call.

345
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:53,037
- Cesar?
- What is it?

346
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:56,443
Come here.
I want to tell you a secret.

347
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,057
Come here.

348
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,719
Hello, darling.

349
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,656
Did you follow me?

350
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,997
Of course I didn't.

351
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,128
But I had the feeling
we'd meet.

352
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:57,036
- How was the brunette?
- Good. Why?

353
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:00,703
From your face, I'd say
you didn't sleep with her.

354
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:04,646
Let me guess. You didn't sleep
with her, but you don't mind.

355
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,509
You have all the time
in the world for that.

356
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,053
And I bet you're
seeing her tomorrow.

357
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,920
- Brilliant.
- Aren't I? There's more.

358
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,323
- Well?
- I scored at the party, too.

359
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,761
But he wasn't up for it,
so I'm still hot for it.

360
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,833
- And?
- And until you meet up again...

361
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,698
with your Miss Universe,
you could have fun.

362
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,007
No. I think I prefer
to go home and sleep.

363
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:33,236
Come on, Cesar.
It's your birthday.

364
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,876
- Skip it. I'm going home.
- What's up, Cesar?

365
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,441
Are you scared?

366
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,391
- Want some of this?
- No, thanks.

367
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,488
Sure, act innocent now.

368
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,123
I don't need that
to enjoy myself.

369
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,895
I see that.

370
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,294
That's not a good idea.

371
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,475
Do what you want.

372
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,507
What's happiness for you?

373
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,880
- What?
- For me, this is happiness.

374
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:53,389
Being here with you.
What about you?

375
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:57,518
I can't handle heavy conversations
right now.

376
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:03,065
Your thoughts are
somewhere else, right?

377
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,658
Maybe.

378
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,977
One thing really bothers me.

379
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:19,840
- What?
- You know nothing about me.

380
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,216
Except my name's Nuria
and I'm a good fuck.

381
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,914
Two important things.

382
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,388
You don't know my address
or telephone number.

383
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,794
We have to start somewhere.
I'm going to see your house now.

384
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,997
It's not far.

385
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,910
Tell me something.

386
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,572
Do you believe in God?

387
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,166
- Hello.
- Hello.

388
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,913
- How are you?
- You got home all right?

389
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:01,474
Yeah. Well, I had
a horrible dream.

390
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,918
That you never saw me again.

391
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:07,185
Yes. I came out ofyour house,
go to my car...

392
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,556
and that crazy bitch
has been following me.

393
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,753
- Who, that Nuria?
- Yes.

394
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,797
She comes over and says,
"Want a lift? "

395
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,425
She goes on so much
I don't know how to say no.

396
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:20,026
So I get in the car,
she drives faster and faster...

397
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,071
and kills herself.

398
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,038
- With me inside.
- That's horrible.

399
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,642
But the worst part...

400
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,702
is that my face
is completely destroyed...

401
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,611
Iike "The Phantom of the Opera."

402
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,412
I couldn't wake up.

403
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,384
I was a monster.

404
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:40,050
You're a monster anyway.

405
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,992
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. I'm a monster, too.

406
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,927
Look.

407
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,566
How was your house?

408
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,571
Was anyone left?

409
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,873
Left where?

410
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:00,206
In your house.
There was a party, remember?

411
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,275
A party?

412
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,488
Dreaming is shit.

413
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,291
Unless the dream was nice.

414
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,590
In the park, children playing,
a girl who lovesyou.

415
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,322
That's why.

416
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,195
Then you wake up
andyou want to die.

417
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,306
At first, I didn 't even have
the strength to react.

418
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,814
I'd been in a coma
for three weeks.

419
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,543
You were lucky.

420
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,813
You could've died
like Nuria.

421
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,287
And what?
I would've been better off.

422
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,382
Didyou see her body?

423
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,223
- I never d id.
- You think she didn't die?

424
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,830
I'm like you.

425
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,957
I only believe what I see.

426
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,202
Cesar, show me your face,
please.

427
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,762
- What for?
- Look.

428
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,502
It's true you had an accident.
It's true...

429
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,703
that you were disfigured,
but not anymore.

430
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,213
Take that off.
The doctors fixed you.

431
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,545
They didn't have
a fucking clue!

432
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:16,246
In the accident, you didn't lose
just skin and some muscle.

433
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,450
The blow was so severe it caused
a multiple fracture of the skull.

434
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,493
We secured the osseous structure
with metal wires...

435
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,688
and over that,
we reinserted the muscles...

436
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,731
we could still retrieve.

437
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,301
Yes, very nice,
but I know all that.

438
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,929
I've had it explained to me
1 50 times.

439
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,006
But you never say
when you'll operate.

440
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:40,373
- I've been waiting two months.
- But we've operated three times.

441
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,811
I wouldn't call that
an operation. I'd call it--

442
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:47,840
Well, I don't know
what you'd call it.

443
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,079
The symmetry isn't perfect...

444
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:53,749
but what we've done with your face is,
if I may say so...

445
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,381
a craftsman's job.

446
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,757
We can't work on skin
which is pure scars.

447
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,056
No, no, there must be some way.

448
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,597
- What?
- "What? "

449
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,827
You're the doctors, aren't you?

450
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,069
A transplant, whatever!

451
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:10,538
There's a problem with fibrosis,
ifwe operate again...

452
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,666
we may just cause
further damage.

453
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,302
We'd need
millimetric precision...

454
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,404
and as of today
it's impossible.

455
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,949
Let's look at this.
I'm not an idiot.

456
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,385
Today, people change
their breasts.

457
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,514
They have hair implants.

458
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:29,649
They even change the color
of their skin.

459
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,389
Are you saying that on
the threshold of the year 2000...

460
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,763
you can't do a simple operation
and sort out this fuck-up?

461
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,305
- It isn't so simple, Cesar. Remember--
- Don't patronize me!

462
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,305
Stop treating me like a child!

463
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,944
I'm not just any patient.

464
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,412
And this isn't a welfare hospital.

465
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,152
I'm willing to pay any amount.

466
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,921
You're in charge.

467
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,491
They say you're the best
in your field.

468
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,564
Well, invent something.
Experiment with me.

469
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,667
I've seen patients
who've lost all their features...

470
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,600
who can't even talk.

471
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,672
At least you can lookyourself
in the eyes.

472
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,231
What good is that?

473
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,936
Every time I look in the mirror,
I want to die.

474
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:23,172
Your case isn't so serious.

475
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,147
Just learn to accept it.

476
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,615
And who will accept me?

477
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,983
Will you explain to the people
who look at me in the street?

478
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,390
Will you tell them
that looks aren't important?

479
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,859
That beauty is on the inside?

480
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,895
We'd like to show you something.

481
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:06,522
What is this?

482
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,253
A facial prosthesis.

483
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,488
We use it in extreme cases
of rejection like yours.

484
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,171
This is shit!

485
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,708
It's not the best solution...

486
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,142
but it's all we can do
for the moment.

487
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,215
I want a face!
Not a mask!

488
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,311
I don't work miracles.

489
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,751
That's what the bastard said.

490
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,155
But in the end, they did.

491
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,616
Did what?

492
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,127
Work a miracle.

493
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,563
So it seems.

494
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,429
So it seems?
Things are or they aren't?

495
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,765
- Did they do it or not?
- I'm tired. Why don't you go?

496
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,706
I'll be back on Tuesday.
Want anything?

497
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,678
- No.
- All right. See you on Tuesday.

498
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,749
A pad and a pencil.

499
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,376
But don't tell them.
I don't want to owe them anything.

500
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,763
Have I changed so much?

501
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,773
Because I recognize you.

502
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,246
How are you?

503
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,146
"How are you? "

504
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:05,553
You're playing a part now, but I don't
know what. Your lips are smiling.

505
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,488
- But your eyes are trembling.
- What?

506
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:10,958
You're really very good
as an actress.

507
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:14,497
I asked you how you were.
You didn't answer.

508
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:18,126
I'm alive.
How should I be?

509
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,998
And I'm tired.

510
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:24,437
Tired ofwaiting foryou to call,
even to say "Tough luck."

511
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:27,102
- I was busy.
- Bullshit!

512
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,642
I was afraid you'd feel uncomfortable
if I rang.

513
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:38,182
You were afraid
you'd feel uncomfortable.

514
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:42,248
Afraid you couldn't
look me in the face, like now.

515
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,471
That's not true.

516
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,723
I've often dreamed
of this moment.

517
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,223
What moment?

518
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:23,166
The moment we'd meet again.

519
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:26,134
In my dream,
we were just like this.

520
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,704
Here, in the park.

521
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,776
Although something was different.

522
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,206
What?

523
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,346
It wasn't raining.

524
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,682
I have to go, Cesar.

525
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,784
- What are you doing tomorrow night?
- Studying. I'm very busy.

526
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,898
- It's Friday. We could meet.
- I've got a lot to do.

527
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,126
All right, so long.

528
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,893
Cesar!

529
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,534
We'll meet ifyou want.

530
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,177
Ifyou want.

531
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,511
As soon as there is
the slightest possibility ofdeath...

532
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,610
the stabilization and transport team
goes into action.

533
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,915
Once the client is declared
legally dead...

534
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,958
he is put into
a maintenance capsule...

535
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:25,426
and the transport legalities
are sorted out.

536
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:28,089
In the storeroom in Arizona
in the U.S.A...

537
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:31,963
a team ofspecialists prepare the body
for final freezing.

538
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,631
Among other measures...

539
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:39,039
blood is replaced by a solution
which preserves the organs.

540
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,172
Finally...

541
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,543
the client is put
in the capsule....

542
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:47,776
where he will remain
until medicine can reenergize him.

543
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,917
To be honest,
I'd have to think it over.

544
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,586
It's hard to accept the idea.

545
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,027
How should we view it?

546
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:04,625
We are, undoubtedly,
facing a major development...

547
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,703
a new challenge for humanity.

548
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:11,206
It's understandable that
the first reaction is rejection.

549
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:14,300
We have now got the means
to do it.

550
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,710
We've got the technology.

551
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:20,306
But, above all, we have
sufficient moral maturity...

552
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:23,352
to understand what
this new step means...

553
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,355
for human evolution,
to look at the future...

554
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,551
and put an end to certain
meaningless taboos...

555
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,184
inherited from ancient religions...

556
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,025
old and useless memories.

557
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,633
Thankyou for speaking to us.

558
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,498
And thankyou
to our audience--

559
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,154
- Hi.
- Hi.

560
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,701
- What's that?
- Shit, isn't it?

561
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,635
But they suggested I wear it
in case of infection.

562
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:21,333
Well, kid, what're you up to?

563
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,605
Arguing with doctors all day.

564
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,739
- You should go out more.
- I'm trying.

565
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,909
- What're you having?
- Rum and Coke. You want one?

566
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,920
- Yes.
- I'll get you one.

567
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,081
I'm going to the bathroom.

568
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:39,123
- Take that off.
- Why?

569
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:42,630
Don't you realize you won't
be able to hide your face?

570
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,966
I told you,
it's to stop infections.

571
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,536
Sure.

572
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:51,199
Ifyou're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to come.

573
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,368
- Sofia did.
- What?

574
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:57,670
- She didn't want to be alone with you.
- Why not?

575
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:01,148
- You're giving her a hard time.
- I'm having a hard time.

576
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,379
Talk to a psychologist,
or to me.

577
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,047
Don't take it out on a girl
you met once.

578
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,919
Did she say that?

579
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,127
Did she say that?

580
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,959
- Bitch!
- Come back!

581
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,867
Whiskey and Coke.

582
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:28,173
- What whiskey?
- What did you say?

583
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:33,280
What whiskey?

584
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,875
Why don't you ask me
to my face, son of a bitch?

585
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,024
Ballantine's.

586
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,483
- Same again.
- No, this one's on me.

587
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:14,585
- Why?
-Just is.

588
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,822
Fix your face, man!

589
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:43,402
- Hello.
- Hello.

590
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:47,466
- Where were you?
- Around.

591
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,478
Pelayo went to look foryou.

592
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,415
And I came to look foryou.

593
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:54,950
Why?

594
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,986
To-- No reason.

595
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:00,953
To buy you a drink.

596
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,660
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

597
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:11,428
Can you tell I'm elbowing in?

598
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,902
The thing is,
I've got a problem.

599
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:19,908
A girl's chasing me, and I need
some help to get rid ofher.

600
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,877
Shit, shit, shit!
She's coming this way.

601
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:26,437
She's coming this way.
Don't look. Don't look.

602
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:31,578
You carry on talking,
act as if he weren't here.

603
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,588
I mean, as if I were here.

604
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,783
Keep talking.
Tra-la-lee, tra-la-la.

605
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,362
What a lovely conversation
we're having.

606
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,598
So that's it, here we are...

607
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:48,432
having a bit of a chat
about life.

608
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:49,904
That's enough!

609
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,349
Where the hell were you?

610
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,020
Around.

611
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,884
I'm leaving. I'm tired.

612
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,326
You two stay ifyou want.

613
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:22,099
Well, this is where
I leave you.

614
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:24,935
- I'll see you home.
- No, I live very close.

615
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,009
- I've got the motorbike.
- No.

616
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:29,704
- Don't be silly.
- Lay off, Pelayo.

617
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,770
She wants to go on her own.

618
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,112
Shut up. You're drunk.

619
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:37,950
I might be drunk,
but I'm not an idiot.

620
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:41,455
- Anyway, I'm not drunk.
- Really, you needn't bother.

621
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:44,688
- As you wish.
- You're the one who's drunk.

622
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,661
We'll call you to meet
some other day.

623
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,891
All right. We could go
to the movies.

624
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,900
- You hear?
- Great!

625
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,095
Well, that's it, then.

626
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,872
No, don't kiss me. You might
get poisoned by my drunken breath.

627
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:05,108
Well, we'll meet up soon.

628
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:06,580
Sure.

629
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,582
We'll meet up soon.

630
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:26,134
It's not cold.

631
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,209
Well...

632
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,616
I'm gonna have to go.

633
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,675
Where are you going?

634
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:45,118
I've just remembered
my bike is back there.

635
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:49,249
- I'll go with you.
- No. Why? You're almost home now.

636
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,260
- See you tomorrow.
- Pelayo, wait a minute.

637
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,459
What?

638
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:03,705
I don't know.

639
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:08,041
You drank too much.
We'll talk tomorrow ifyou want.

640
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:11,170
- Tomorrow I'll wish I were dead.
- You won't.

641
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:13,272
You just need to rest.

642
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:15,750
Pelayo!

643
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:22,722
You're my best friend.

644
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,980
Son of a bitch!

645
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:10,826
Open your eyes.

646
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,507
Cesar.

647
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,017
It's me.

648
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,588
Sofia!

649
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,653
- What are you doing here?
- Forgive me.

650
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,025
Why?

651
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,912
I love you.

652
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:07,955
Come on.

653
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:15,186
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

654
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:18,300
I still can't believe
this is really happening.

655
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:22,527
Where's Pelayo?

656
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,574
I don't know.
He went with you, didn't he?

657
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,472
Yes.

658
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:28,977
Of course.

659
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:35,115
Come on.

660
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:02,344
God, what a sensation!

661
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,038
Ofwhat?

662
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,879
Do you ever feel
you've lived something before?

663
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,886
Yes.

664
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:13,388
Why is that?

665
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,856
They say it's a lapse
in the brain.

666
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,124
I've been here before.

667
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,965
It usually goes away
after a few seconds.

668
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,235
I don't want it to go away.

669
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:43,583
You've made use ofyour time.

670
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,247
That's all there is here.

671
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,822
Very pretty. Is it Sofia?

672
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:05,267
How much longer will I be here?

673
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,502
No one ever knows that.

674
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:10,478
Even my worst nightmare
was never like this place.

675
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:14,347
It's a psychiatric penitentiary.
No more, no less.

676
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:20,854
- I shouldn't be here.
- You're accused of murder.

677
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:23,893
- I don't even know what I did.
- Tell me something.

678
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:29,192
-Does the name Eli mean anything to you?
-Eli?

679
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,563
You know a girl with that name?

680
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,398
No. Why do you ask?

681
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,405
It seems you kept
repeating it last night.

682
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:40,169
I guess I was dreaming.

683
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:43,575
- What did you dream?
- I can't remember.

684
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:48,106
- It could be important.
- How could it be important?

685
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:52,210
Look, I can prove you didn't know
what you were doing...

686
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,257
but first I have to find
some explanation for all this.

687
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:58,783
There is no explanation.
I told you the other day.

688
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,351
What did you dream, Cesar?

689
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,133
I don't know.

690
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,668
I only remember bits.

691
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:14,301
First, I'm in a kind of office.

692
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,674
A secretary shows me
into another office.

693
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,975
There's a photo
ofa sunset and a man.

694
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:24,485
Then, I don't know.

695
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:27,682
- They show me lots ofpapers.
- What papers?

696
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,417
I don't know.

697
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:32,119
But I sign them.

698
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:35,096
Does the office belong
to your company?

699
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:38,166
No, I don't recognize it.

700
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,327
You dreamed of a place
you'd never been?

701
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:44,133
Yes. That happens a lot,
doesn't it?

702
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,403
Are they the papers
you signed with the doctors?

703
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:51,310
No, what happened with the doctors
was surreal.

704
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:54,906
- Why?
- They rang me to go to the hospital.

705
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,811
When I arrived,
the whole surgical team was waiting.

706
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:05,588
Formonths, those faces had looked at me
with indifference and impotence.

707
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:08,253
Now they were all smiles.

708
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:13,335
The same bastard who had said my case
was hopeless talked about an operation.

709
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:17,702
They had a new revolutionary system
in the clinic now.

710
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:22,370
They said that within two weeks my face
would be completely reconstructed.

711
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:24,378
You didn 't believe them?

712
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:30,316
Not at fi rst. I thought it was just
a way to get more money out of me.

713
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,856
But they showed me
all the gad gets for the operation.

714
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:37,187
It looked like science fiction.

715
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,957
All I could see were cables,
switches, monitors.

716
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:45,431
Actually, I never really knew
what they were going to do.

717
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,526
But I thought I'd nothing to lose.

718
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,606
Those people
were used to rhinoplasties...

719
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:54,973
Iiposuctions, hair transplants,
but my operation was much more.

720
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:57,308
In less than a week...

721
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:00,246
my life had turned around.

722
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:05,048
One night, I was lying
on the ground drunk, waiting to die.

723
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:07,418
The next morning,
my dreams were coming true...

724
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,855
I i ke i n the movies.

725
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:13,919
Sofia loved me, and the doctors
found the miracle cure.

726
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:17,796
I don't know.
Obviously, I was suspicious.

727
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,629
Suspicious?

728
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:23,103
Ofwhom? Ofwhat?

729
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:25,106
I don't know.

730
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:28,300
In life, you never know.

731
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,936
Happiness comes
when you least expect it.

732
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,483
I once knew a guy
who was alone in the world.

733
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,419
Suddenly, he was married
with two daughters.

734
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:43,152
Fuck, you've got
a strange idea of happiness.

735
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:55,970
Well, that depends on the individual.
What's happiness foryou?

736
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,006
What's happiness foryou?

737
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,569
Don't ask any more stupid questions.

738
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:06,046
But at that time, you were happy.
Or weren't you?

739
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:09,482
So what?
My life now is shit.

740
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:14,045
All I can do is eat, shit, sleep
and dream of my memories.

741
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:17,622
It's good that you remember.

742
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:36,109
- Well?
- Well, what?

743
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:40,444
They were to remove
the plates today.

744
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,519
- And they did.
- And?

745
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:47,317
Well, my ears are where
they should be.

746
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,620
Cesar, don't scare me.

747
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:55,224
- Take off the plates.
- You can do it.

748
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:16,507
How did they do it?

749
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:58,646
Wait.Just to say
that I love you.

750
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:02,915
You're going too fast...

751
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:06,257
considering we met yesterday.

752
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:07,453
Yesterday?

753
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:10,531
My birthday, don't you remember?

754
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:15,930
I met an incredible girl.
Her name was Sofia.

755
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:19,667
But today I woke up feeling great...

756
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,300
and now I'm with the girl again.

757
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,215
What is it?

758
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:33,052
What is it?

759
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,352
Ifyou want me to move,
you have to put in a coin.

760
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:43,731
Ting!

761
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:55,467
We never appreciate the good moments
till they're over.

762
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:57,671
Maybe that's why
they're good moments.

763
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:00,978
- We don't stop to think about them.
- Perhaps.

764
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,984
What happened to Pelayo?

765
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:05,646
- What's up?
- Hang on a minute.

766
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,456
- That's it.
- About time.

767
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,925
- Want anything else?
- No, thanks.

768
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:17,631
How's things, Pelayo?

769
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:19,325
Fine.

770
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,629
How's things, Pelayo?

771
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:24,205
Fine.

772
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,604
Yeah.

773
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,642
I'm actually not as fucked up
as I look.

774
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:33,510
I'm used to you always winning,
you bastard.

775
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:36,574
- And Sofia isn't that great.
- You said she was ideal.

776
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,380
Really?

777
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,980
I was drunk.

778
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,116
Anyway, we're friends.

779
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,803
Bastard!

780
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,967
- What's that on your face?
- What?

781
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:07,311
- Fuck, there's a seam opening!
- What are you on about?

782
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,489
You fucking idiot!

783
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:17,609
What's the matter?

784
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,222
I hate dreaming.

785
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,498
You're tickling me.

786
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:45,907
What's wrong?

787
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,175
What is it?

788
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,013
- Where's Sofia?
- What?

789
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:57,712
What have you done with Sofia?

790
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:00,685
- I am Sofia.
- You bitch!

791
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:08,752
- You're mad. You're mad.
- Where is she?

792
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:33,313
In one minute,
I'm going to call the police.

793
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,847
You'll be in trouble
if Sofia doesn't appear.

794
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,484
So you survived the accident.

795
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:41,426
What accident?

796
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:45,021
- Whose body was it?
- I didn't have an accident.

797
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:48,398
No. It wasn't an accident.
It was attempted murder.

798
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,631
A pity you didn't see my face, bitch!

799
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:54,971
- Why do this? How have I changed?
- You haven't.

800
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:58,012
You're the same lunatic
who gate-crashed my party.

801
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,073
I'm the girl you made love to just now.
I'm Sofia.

802
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:05,745
Stop saying you're Sofia,
do you hear?

803
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:08,982
Don't say her name!

804
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:11,924
You won't tell me where she is.

805
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,758
You never will.

806
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,435
Cesar.

807
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:26,540
I love you.

808
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:32,580
- Hello.
- Hello.

809
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:39,384
You can go. I'll see to this.

810
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,553
Right.

811
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,957
Let me get this clear.

812
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:51,991
- Where were you last night?
- At home. I told that gentleman.

813
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:54,102
At home. With whom?

814
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:57,570
- With a girl.
- The girl just questioned?

815
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:00,335
No, that's another girl.
I was with Sofia.

816
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,309
The girl I spoke to was Sofia.

817
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:04,709
Yes, that's what she says,
but it's a lie.

818
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:08,546
- Who is she then?
- She's Nuria.

819
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:09,947
Nuria what?

820
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:15,020
I don't know.
She never told me her surname.

821
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,524
Let's see.

822
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:21,392
You were at home with a girl
called Sofia, and suddenly--

823
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:24,364
I go to the bathroom, come back,
and she's in Sofia's place.

824
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:25,694
Where's Sofia?

825
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,666
Ask Nuria.
She's pretending to be her.

826
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,437
You don't know her surname?

827
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,532
But who do you believe, her or me?

828
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:38,841
Listen, that girl's papers
are all in order. We've let her go.

829
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:44,445
- You've what?
- And I assure you she's called Sofia.

830
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,956
Sofia Cueto, and she lives
at number 2, Quiros St.

831
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:50,388
- No!
- No, what?

832
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:54,724
Well, yes, but that's another girl.
I know the real Sofia.

833
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:57,127
Then tell me where she is.

834
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,927
Because, legally the girl
you're talking about...

835
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:05,005
only exists in your imagination.

836
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,376
- I don't believe this.
- And another thing.

837
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,948
The girl looks as if she'd been hit.

838
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:16,211
She was in my house
supplanting my girlfriend!

839
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:20,379
I don't know why,
but she wouldn't press charges.

840
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:24,325
Fucking great!
So now she's the victim!

841
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:26,792
Tell me.
Are you on drugs?

842
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:30,457
- God!
- You were under psychiatric care.

843
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:33,467
My face was destroyed
in a car crash she caused!

844
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,264
Your face looks fine.

845
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,201
Because--

846
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,173
It doesn't matter.
I've got nothing more to say.

847
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:41,834
Young man.

848
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:45,038
I'd advise you to see a psychiatrist.

849
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,178
Are you an idiot?

850
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,780
- What the fuck is this?
- What do you mean?

851
01:14:56,925 --> 01:15:01,362
Ifyou wanted to fuck her up,
there are other ways to do it!

852
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:05,432
- Keep away from Sofia!
- It isn't Sofia. It's Nuria!

853
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:06,831
Nuria's dead!

854
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:09,962
Calm down, oryou'll be sleeping
in a cell tonight!

855
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:12,335
Don't ever talk to me again!

856
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:15,865
I don't know what the cops told you,
but Nuria is alive!

857
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:18,037
The cops didn't tell me,
Sofia did.

858
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,671
Listen, you spoke to her by phone,
didn't you?

859
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:23,182
- Let go!
- It wasn't Sofia.

860
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:26,483
Nuria can imitate her voice.
She took her ID, her apartment.

861
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:30,685
It wasn't over the phone.
I've just dropped her home.

862
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:32,726
She looked like this.

863
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:41,902
Nice photo, isn't it?

864
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:43,995
You going to say that isn't Sofia?

865
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:47,234
But that's--
Is this a joke or what?

866
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,174
You're crazy, man.

867
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:53,243
I'm crazy? I'm crazy?

868
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:58,215
You're the ones who are mad!
You're all mad!

869
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:00,187
Let go of me!

870
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,290
God, what's happening?

871
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,293
It's my partners, right?

872
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:08,623
They've paid you.
This is a plot!

873
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:12,666
Look at yourself. You haven't
been right since the accident.

874
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:15,503
Fuckyou!

875
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,400
Are you saying--

876
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:23,706
Are you saying this is the girl
you ran after the other night?

877
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:26,077
- Is this your ideal girl?
- Yes!

878
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,481
And you took her.

879
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,784
You need a psychiatrist!

880
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:48,636
Problems?

881
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,138
I'm in no mood, so just--

882
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,800
There's an explanation for all this.

883
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:56,309
Cesar.

884
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:00,713
Who are you?

885
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:03,649
- You've seen me on TV.
- What do you want?

886
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:07,718
I'm here to help you.

887
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:11,418
First of all, it's very important
that you calm down.

888
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:12,754
Calm down?

889
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:16,386
You must overcome your fears
and regain control.

890
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:19,467
What control do you mean?
I'm fine.

891
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:21,263
Who says you aren't?

892
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:24,066
They do. All of them.

893
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:26,231
They think I'm mad.

894
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:28,309
No, of course you're not mad.

895
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:32,973
But what if I told you
you were dreaming?

896
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:39,153
No, no, no.

897
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:41,086
Why not?

898
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:44,647
- I know what's real, and this is real.
- How do you know?

899
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:47,318
You discoveryour dreams
when you wake.

900
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:49,157
I just know.

901
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:52,926
- My dreams are much simpler than this.
- No dream is simple.

902
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:55,866
Look at those people.

903
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:59,236
They seem to be talking
about their own business.

904
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,673
Completely unaware ofyou.

905
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:05,770
And yet, they could be there
because you wanted it.

906
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:10,648
What's more, you could have them
at your complete service...

907
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:12,913
or have them destroy you.

908
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:15,148
I want them to be quiet.

909
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:17,157
And you, too.

910
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:33,139
See?

911
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:46,152
What's going on here?

912
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,051
Someone tell me the fucking truth!

913
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,926
The truth?
Maybe you couldn't take it.

914
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:03,131
It had to be a setup,
a big joke to drive me crazy.

915
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:05,900
They all knew. Nuria, Pelayo,
the police, the guy at the bar.

916
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:08,134
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

917
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,643
You said you saw him on TV.
On what program?

918
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,270
I don't know!

919
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:16,680
I don't know. One that talked
about freezing the dead.

920
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,516
- Freezing the dead?
- Cryonization.

921
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,715
Like they did to Walt Disney.

922
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:29,863
Maybe I can help you remember.

923
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,660
Is that a threat?

924
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:36,895
Lie down.

925
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,776
What's that?

926
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:45,346
A syringe.

927
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,277
Relax.

928
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:51,979
My arm's stinging.

929
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:54,578
It's a tranquilizer.

930
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:56,351
What for?

931
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,835
These things are all bullshit.

932
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:11,839
Ifyou'd trusted psychiatrists more,
you mightn't be here now.

933
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:17,973
That finger,
it's making me nervous.

934
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:20,014
You needn't be afraid.

935
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:22,709
- I'm not afraid.
- Stop talking and concentrate.

936
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,013
Come on.

937
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:26,519
Fuck.

938
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:29,848
I feel dizzy.

939
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,425
Good-bye, Cesar.

940
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:39,561
Very good. Now let's see
ifyou can tell me about that dream.

941
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:45,068
- In my dream, it isn't raining.
- The office dream.

942
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:46,231
Eli.

943
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,741
That's it. I want you
to tell me who Eli is.

944
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,438
- A secretary.
- Eli is a secretary?

945
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:54,276
She tells me to go in.
They're expecting me.

946
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,247
Who 's expecting you?

947
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,621
- The Frenchman from the TV.
- Sit down, please.

948
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,849
It's a contract.

949
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:04,915
- Eli--
- Cesar, who is Eli?

950
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:10,190
You won 't regret it.
Sign.

951
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:14,200
- What are you signing?
- Eli will see to everything.

952
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,829
What have you signed?

953
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:22,174
What's wrong?

954
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:24,177
What's wrong, Cesar?

955
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:26,179
Why are you crying?

956
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:29,182
- I'm going to die.
- You're not going to die.

957
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,551
- I don 't know how many.
- How many what?

958
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:36,750
- Pills.
- You took pills?

959
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:40,350
- How many should I take?
- Pills to feel better?

960
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:42,019
I don 't want to.

961
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:45,190
When I count to three,
you'll wake up. One. Two.

962
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:53,636
I thought that, up to now,
you'd told me the truth.

963
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:57,177
What do you mean?

964
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:59,179
You said you took nothing.

965
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:02,583
Cesar, I'll ask you
for the last time.

966
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:05,585
- Did you take drugs?
- Fuck! Why does everyone--

967
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:08,350
Stop playacting.
Tell me the truth!

968
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,254
- I must know what you took.
- I didn't take anything!

969
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:15,660
Don't you see? Your brain
could have been affected by the pills.

970
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,925
- I didn't take any!
- You said you did!

971
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:20,331
It's just a dream!

972
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,426
Why make it more important
than it is?

973
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:25,836
Can't you tell dreams from reality?
I can!

974
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:29,274
Really? Don't make me laugh!

975
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:32,279
Bodies that come to life,
people who disappear...

976
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:34,372
you, the Phantom of the Opera!

977
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:42,353
Tell me one thing. Do you remember
what you did to Sofia?

978
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:46,960
It wasn't Sofia.

979
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:51,192
I don't care who it was.
What did you do to her?

980
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,197
You remember?

981
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:32,432
My God!

982
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:38,995
What are you doing?
I thought you were a burglar.

983
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,603
Who are you?

984
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:45,269
I'm Sofia.

985
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:48,047
Sofia.

986
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:52,847
You're not Sofia.

987
01:24:57,725 --> 01:25:00,091
Cesar, this will all
be over soon.

988
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:02,095
We'll be together again.

989
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:06,434
You'll forget Nuria
and I won't be afraid ofyou.

990
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:13,099
- I'm thirsty.
- I'll get some water.

991
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:55,077
Sofia!

992
01:25:56,885 --> 01:25:59,353
Yes, Cesar, I'm Sofia.

993
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:05,152
I'm Sofia.

994
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:42,014
I want to see you.

995
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:45,251
I want to see you.
I want to see you!

996
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:51,995
I want to see you!

997
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:37,470
At times you dream
you're with someone.

998
01:29:37,672 --> 01:29:40,300
For example, your father.

999
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:43,206
In seconds,
he becomes your mother...

1000
01:29:43,277 --> 01:29:47,179
and then, the news vendor
on the corner.

1001
01:29:47,248 --> 01:29:51,241
Yet you still feel as if
you're talking to the same person.

1002
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:57,389
You thought you were at home, but
suddenly you realize you're in a school.

1003
01:29:57,458 --> 01:30:00,916
Or a hospital, or a prison.

1004
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,198
Dreams are like that.

1005
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:08,132
And at times the mind behaves
as if it were in a dream.

1006
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:11,000
- You know what derangement is?
- For fuck's sake!

1007
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:14,540
Say I'm stupid ifyou want,
but this isn't derangement!

1008
01:30:14,642 --> 01:30:16,633
Then what is it?

1009
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:19,338
You tell me,
because I don't know.

1010
01:30:20,481 --> 01:30:23,450
I don't know what's in here,
or why you killed your girlfriend.

1011
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:26,612
I don't know who Eli is,
or that man from the TV.

1012
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:30,054
- I don't know anything.
- That makes two of us.

1013
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:44,637
Will you still come
after the trial?

1014
01:30:44,705 --> 01:30:46,764
Don't you hate the sight of me?

1015
01:30:49,577 --> 01:30:52,705
- What will you plead?
- Why do you ask that?

1016
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:55,749
The first hearing
is next week.

1017
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:01,482
Temporary derangement.

1018
01:31:01,589 --> 01:31:04,387
It's your best chance.

1019
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:06,483
Even so, it won't be much use.

1020
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:09,095
They won't believe me.

1021
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:11,097
Even I don't believe it.

1022
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,598
What do you believe?

1023
01:31:14,202 --> 01:31:18,434
I thinkyou're very sick
and should stay here for a long time.

1024
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:22,838
Don't worry.
I'll get at least 20 years.

1025
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:26,004
Cesar, you may not believe it,
but I care about you.

1026
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,605
I care a lot about you.

1027
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:32,176
Look, kid.

1028
01:31:32,253 --> 01:31:35,848
Your case interests me.
I'm sorry about what's happened.

1029
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:39,358
I even thought someone
was playing tricks on you, but...

1030
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:41,918
I can't and mustn't
exceed my duties.

1031
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:45,022
- I'm just a psychiatrist.
- You don't look like one.

1032
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,726
- What do I look like?
- My father.

1033
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:49,860
Preaching at me all day.

1034
01:31:49,937 --> 01:31:52,770
Your father's dead.

1035
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:54,466
There you go.

1036
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:06,614
By the way, what happened to that man
with the wife and two daughters?

1037
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:12,893
I don't know.
I never saw him again.

1038
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:14,895
Take my advice, get a lawyer.

1039
01:32:14,929 --> 01:32:17,056
Good-bye, Cesar.

1040
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:21,895
Good-bye.

1041
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:25,928
...the main Spanish investment,
but certainly the most novel.

1042
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,880
...its economic presence in Cuba.

1043
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:47,416
...depending on the era.

1044
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:51,464
In the Roman Empire, for example,
the normal thing was to live...

1045
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:53,567
only 25 years.

1046
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:02,066
Who's got the remote?

1047
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:05,737
Give it to me!

1048
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:14,678
Get it off him!

1049
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:32,570
What's up?

1050
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:35,301
There's a computer here
connected to Internet.

1051
01:33:35,376 --> 01:33:38,277
They'll only let me use it
ifyou come with me.

1052
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:41,804
- Why do you want Internet?
- I know what Eli is.

1053
01:33:41,882 --> 01:33:43,315
Wait!

1054
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:46,285
Eli isn't a person,
it's a company.

1055
01:33:46,354 --> 01:33:48,686
- How do you know?
- It isn't Eli.

1056
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:51,815
It's L.E. They're the initials
of an American company.

1057
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:55,451
- What are you doing?
- Checking the "initials program."

1058
01:33:55,563 --> 01:33:58,157
It'll tell us all it knows
about L.E.

1059
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:04,129
Shit!

1060
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:07,365
- It'll take ages.
- No, wait.

1061
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:14,942
Fuck!

1062
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:17,280
I feel like
I've done this before.

1063
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:20,013
A cerebral dysfunction.
A lapse in the brain.

1064
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:22,612
No, not this time.

1065
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:24,123
My God!

1066
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:26,489
- That's it.
- The photo in your dream?

1067
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:29,653
I had to see it before
I could dream about it, right?

1068
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:30,992
"Cyronics."

1069
01:34:31,098 --> 01:34:33,123
- Cryonization.
- I'll print this.

1070
01:34:33,234 --> 01:34:37,364
Wait a minute. I don't see
what this has to do with your case.

1071
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:40,872
The key is in here.
Look, there's an office in Madrid.

1072
01:34:40,941 --> 01:34:43,341
I'll go and check it out.

1073
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:45,879
No! I have to go, too.

1074
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:49,575
- I can't get you out of here.
- I'd be let out under supervision.

1075
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:51,379
Make up some excuse.

1076
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:53,214
- It isn't easy.
- You can do it.

1077
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:55,881
You know something else,
don't you?

1078
01:34:58,793 --> 01:35:00,124
I don't know anything.

1079
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:02,992
- I've just got a feeling.
- What is it?

1080
01:35:03,097 --> 01:35:05,895
I have to go there,
one way or another.

1081
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:54,141
Let's get things straight.
We're outside, I'm armed.

1082
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:56,808
My job is to stop you
doing anything stupid.

1083
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:59,181
Try anything,
and you get a bullet.

1084
01:36:33,187 --> 01:36:35,417
I've been here before.

1085
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:37,787
- This way.
- Move.

1086
01:36:52,973 --> 01:36:54,964
You've got 20 minutes.

1087
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:07,852
It's just like in my dream.

1088
01:37:12,026 --> 01:37:14,017
Good morning.
Can I help you?

1089
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:18,761
Well, actually, we wanted
to speak to Mr. Duvernois.

1090
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:22,566
He's my son.

1091
01:37:24,872 --> 01:37:26,703
He's very shy.

1092
01:37:29,109 --> 01:37:31,339
Mr. Duvernois isn't here
right now.

1093
01:37:31,412 --> 01:37:34,848
But, first of all, do you know
what cryonization is?

1094
01:37:34,949 --> 01:37:36,678
Well, more or less.

1095
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:40,709
Here are some leaflets.
You can read them while you're waiting.

1096
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:43,688
One of my colleagues
will be with you soon.

1097
01:37:43,791 --> 01:37:44,849
Thankyou.

1098
01:37:44,925 --> 01:37:48,952
"Live without limits.
Tomorrow is for the foresighted."

1099
01:37:49,063 --> 01:37:50,963
What is this?
Some kind of sect?

1100
01:37:51,098 --> 01:37:55,535
"Cryonization is the biostasis
or preservation of human beings.

1101
01:37:55,603 --> 01:37:59,004
It is the bridge to carry
our patients to a future...

1102
01:37:59,106 --> 01:38:02,075
when technology
will restore them to life."

1103
01:38:05,813 --> 01:38:08,043
You pay to live eternally.

1104
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:12,814
They laughed at Jules Verne.

1105
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:16,550
Cesar, all this
is absolutely impossible.

1106
01:38:16,657 --> 01:38:18,625
What do you know
of the future?

1107
01:38:18,759 --> 01:38:22,354
They promise what the Church
has always promised.

1108
01:38:22,463 --> 01:38:24,863
Immortality.
Except they're quacks, not priests.

1109
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:26,958
How are you involved?

1110
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:29,535
You're not cryonized.
You're alive.

1111
01:38:29,603 --> 01:38:32,504
This is the contract,
ifyou want to look at it.

1112
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:36,839
The procedure is very simple.
You could die at any time.

1113
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:39,777
Today, tomorrow, in 20 years.
It doesn't matter to us.

1114
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,441
At the very moment
you're declared legally dead...

1115
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:47,452
Life Extension transfers your body
to our store in Arizona.

1116
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:50,045
There, it's frozen
at minus 78 degrees.

1117
01:38:50,124 --> 01:38:53,958
We call that "total suspension,"
and it costs $240,000.

1118
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:57,394
30,000 pays for the freezing process,
and the rest...

1119
01:38:57,498 --> 01:38:59,523
goes into
an investment fund...

1120
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:02,227
the interests from which
pay for maintenance...

1121
01:39:02,369 --> 01:39:05,497
and resurrection costs,
the day that it's possible.

1122
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:07,403
If it is possible.

1123
01:39:07,474 --> 01:39:11,706
We believe that the reanimation
of the dead will be possible.

1124
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:13,770
- What's this?
- What?

1125
01:39:13,881 --> 01:39:16,281
Clause 1 4.
Artificial perception.

1126
01:39:16,383 --> 01:39:20,843
It's a concept that we haven't
fully developed yet.

1127
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:23,617
Look. This is a life.

1128
01:39:23,724 --> 01:39:25,624
Birth and death.

1129
01:39:25,759 --> 01:39:28,751
Let's say you've got
a terminal illness.

1130
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:32,730
Of course you want to go on living,
but not in the future.

1131
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:37,133
That doesn't interest you.
You want to live your life now.

1132
01:39:37,204 --> 01:39:40,435
Very well.
You die, we freeze you...

1133
01:39:40,507 --> 01:39:44,967
and when we can resuscitate you,
we'll have you live...

1134
01:39:45,746 --> 01:39:47,008
a dream.

1135
01:39:48,515 --> 01:39:51,177
- A dream?
- It will all look real.

1136
01:39:51,285 --> 01:39:53,480
Your family and friends,
your city...

1137
01:39:53,554 --> 01:39:55,488
the world, even this office.

1138
01:39:55,589 --> 01:39:57,523
But it'll be a virtual reality.

1139
01:39:57,624 --> 01:40:01,321
What's more, we'll make you forget
that you've died...

1140
01:40:01,428 --> 01:40:03,362
and that you signed
this contract.

1141
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:05,193
- How?
- Very simple.

1142
01:40:05,332 --> 01:40:07,323
Wiping it from your memory.

1143
01:40:07,434 --> 01:40:10,301
You'll live your life linearly,
as if nothing had happened.

1144
01:40:10,404 --> 01:40:14,170
And best of all, you'll live it
as you like, as you wish.

1145
01:40:14,241 --> 01:40:16,709
You'll decide at all times.

1146
01:40:16,777 --> 01:40:20,713
But what ifthere were mistakes?

1147
01:40:20,781 --> 01:40:24,376
What if the dream
was transformed into a nightmare?

1148
01:40:24,485 --> 01:40:27,511
Well, the subconscious
can always play a dirty trick.

1149
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:31,149
But we're not cowboys.
This is a serious company.

1150
01:40:31,258 --> 01:40:35,592
And virtual reality technology
is constantly making huge advances.

1151
01:40:35,729 --> 01:40:37,720
Look.

1152
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:39,594
I'll be honest.

1153
01:40:40,734 --> 01:40:43,760
Signing Clause 1 4
is like signing for paradise.

1154
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:50,469
It's hard to believe.
But they laughed at Jules Verne.

1155
01:40:55,315 --> 01:40:56,373
Excuse me.

1156
01:41:01,321 --> 01:41:04,154
- Where are you going so fast?
- To the bathroom.

1157
01:41:04,258 --> 01:41:06,886
- Well, not so fast.
- I'll go with him.

1158
01:41:06,994 --> 01:41:09,462
He just felt ill, don't worry.

1159
01:41:15,502 --> 01:41:17,470
Cesar, calm down, please.

1160
01:41:17,571 --> 01:41:19,937
This is a dream.
It's the only explanation.

1161
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:22,008
What he said is impossible.

1162
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:24,474
In the 20th century,
but maybe not in the 30th.

1163
01:41:24,578 --> 01:41:27,979
- Maybe not, but we're in 1 997.
- That's what it seems.

1164
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:31,051
- I paid for it to seem like that.
- Listen! If this is a dream--

1165
01:41:31,151 --> 01:41:35,315
Look at me! If this is a dream,
it means that I don't exist!

1166
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:37,754
- I just imagine you.
- No!

1167
01:41:37,858 --> 01:41:41,294
- Cesar, I'm real.
- How do I know that?

1168
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:45,320
Can't you tell a dream from reality?
Is this a dream, eh?

1169
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:47,832
Tell me, is this a dream?

1170
01:41:50,437 --> 01:41:52,962
Cesar, I'm wearing myself out
over this case.

1171
01:41:53,073 --> 01:41:56,668
There is no case. I didn't kill anyone.
It's all a nightmare.

1172
01:41:56,743 --> 01:42:00,270
Fuck it, Cesar, trust me!
This isn't a dream.

1173
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:02,280
- They got it wrong.
- Who?

1174
01:42:02,382 --> 01:42:07,251
I don't know! But they mixed up Sofia
and Nuria! I see a face that isn't mine.

1175
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:10,154
I'm sick of hearing that!
Your face is fine.

1176
01:42:10,257 --> 01:42:13,715
You're behaving like a child,
hiding behind that mask.

1177
01:42:13,861 --> 01:42:16,796
- Go on, take it off!
- I don't want to see myself!

1178
01:42:16,864 --> 01:42:19,332
I don't care about that.
I want to see you.

1179
01:42:19,433 --> 01:42:23,631
Don't you realize? All that matters
is what I see! It's my dream!

1180
01:42:23,704 --> 01:42:28,334
Say that once more and
I'll have you locked up in an asylum.

1181
01:42:28,442 --> 01:42:32,344
Show me your face.
Now. You owe it to me.

1182
01:42:52,499 --> 01:42:57,596
Cesar, look in the mirror and tell me
ifyou thinkyou're disfigured.

1183
01:43:02,209 --> 01:43:03,267
God!

1184
01:43:03,377 --> 01:43:05,777
Why do you keep seeing
what isn't there?

1185
01:43:05,879 --> 01:43:08,040
- You look fine.
- I'm a monster!

1186
01:43:08,148 --> 01:43:11,675
What do you mean?
Anybody'd like to have your face.

1187
01:43:11,785 --> 01:43:13,514
You look normal.

1188
01:43:13,587 --> 01:43:16,351
Not just normal.
You're handsome!

1189
01:43:17,558 --> 01:43:21,517
Cesar, listen. Maybe you've got
something like anorexia.

1190
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:24,996
Some girls insist they're fat
and end up crazy.

1191
01:43:25,098 --> 01:43:26,122
Cesar!

1192
01:43:28,135 --> 01:43:30,194
I want to wake up!

1193
01:43:30,337 --> 01:43:32,999
I want to wake up!

1194
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:35,973
- Hold it!
- I want to wake up!

1195
01:43:36,109 --> 01:43:37,474
Fuck!

1196
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:39,572
Shit!

1197
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:42,308
- Freeze!
- Don't shoot!

1198
01:43:43,483 --> 01:43:46,782
This is a nightmare!
It's a nightmare!

1199
01:43:58,699 --> 01:44:02,692
You! Wait a minute!
You're not to leave!

1200
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:04,236
Stop!

1201
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,840
Wait a minute!

1202
01:44:31,498 --> 01:44:32,931
It's a dream!

1203
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,298
It's a dream!

1204
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:56,912
Don't move!
Drop the gun!

1205
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:02,387
- I want to wake up. I want to wake up.
- Don't move!

1206
01:45:02,496 --> 01:45:05,954
I want to wake up!

1207
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:18,473
Antonio.

1208
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:21,813
Antonio!

1209
01:45:23,183 --> 01:45:25,083
What?

1210
01:45:25,185 --> 01:45:27,312
You're crushing me.

1211
01:45:28,588 --> 01:45:32,649
I'd better not move.
I've been shot in the back.

1212
01:45:33,927 --> 01:45:36,020
How do you know?

1213
01:45:37,230 --> 01:45:39,824
Well...

1214
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,299
because--

1215
01:45:55,115 --> 01:45:57,879
What's going on here?

1216
01:45:57,951 --> 01:45:59,976
What the fuck's going on?

1217
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:01,884
I told you, it's a dream.

1218
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:04,252
Shut up! Shut up!

1219
01:46:06,259 --> 01:46:10,355
I know what this is.
It's one of those Candid Camera jokes.

1220
01:46:11,264 --> 01:46:14,290
You did a great job, I loved it,
but enough's enough!

1221
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:16,869
- I see someone.
- Where?

1222
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:18,995
Up there, on the roof.

1223
01:46:19,139 --> 01:46:21,403
I can't see a thing.

1224
01:46:22,275 --> 01:46:24,539
Where are you going?

1225
01:46:26,847 --> 01:46:31,375
Come on, Antonio. Don't think
about it anymore oryou'll go crazy.

1226
01:46:47,634 --> 01:46:49,226
Hello, Cesar.

1227
01:46:51,138 --> 01:46:53,106
It's time I introduced myself.

1228
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:56,903
My name is Serge Duvernois.
I represent Life Extension.

1229
01:46:56,977 --> 01:46:58,376
We met...

1230
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:00,910
1 50 years ago.

1231
01:47:01,014 --> 01:47:03,710
What? Has the world gone mad?

1232
01:47:03,817 --> 01:47:07,514
There's no world.
It's all in that gentleman's mind.

1233
01:47:07,587 --> 01:47:09,521
Including you and me.

1234
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:12,387
Sure! Shall I thump you
to see if it hurts?

1235
01:47:12,492 --> 01:47:17,589
Try it. They can make you disappear
right now, like everyone else.

1236
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:20,598
- And who are "they," may I ask?
- The company.

1237
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:23,032
Life Extension.

1238
01:47:23,136 --> 01:47:25,536
They know everything
we're saying.

1239
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:31,305
They know what is going through Cesar's
mind an instant after he thinks it.

1240
01:47:31,411 --> 01:47:34,938
If they can make me disappear,
why haven't they done it?

1241
01:47:35,048 --> 01:47:37,039
It would be virtually incorrect.

1242
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:39,277
You've just saved his life.

1243
01:47:39,386 --> 01:47:42,947
Virtually incorrect?
Do you think I'm an idiot or what?

1244
01:47:43,056 --> 01:47:46,583
No, quite the opposite.
You're a great guy.

1245
01:47:46,693 --> 01:47:49,491
A character who is
very necessary for Cesar.

1246
01:47:50,564 --> 01:47:52,293
A character?

1247
01:47:53,533 --> 01:47:55,433
- Where are you going?
- To look for someone.

1248
01:47:55,535 --> 01:47:59,027
There is no one.
People aren't necessary now.

1249
01:48:06,813 --> 01:48:08,838
Why didn't you wake me before?

1250
01:48:09,983 --> 01:48:13,544
You only had to ask.
But that was difficult.

1251
01:48:13,653 --> 01:48:17,612
Because, in theory,
you wouldn't know you were dreaming.

1252
01:48:17,757 --> 01:48:19,452
Since when?

1253
01:48:19,593 --> 01:48:21,618
Remember the day
of the discotheque?

1254
01:48:21,761 --> 01:48:25,595
That night, when you fell asleep
on the sidewalk...

1255
01:48:25,699 --> 01:48:28,167
was the one chosen
for the splice.

1256
01:48:28,268 --> 01:48:29,860
What splice?

1257
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:33,462
The splice between your real life
andyour virtual life.

1258
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:37,135
A splice of 1 50 years
which you didn 't notice...

1259
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:40,611
because you were dead
and frozen.

1260
01:48:40,714 --> 01:48:42,705
From when you woke up...

1261
01:48:42,816 --> 01:48:45,011
nothing was real.

1262
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:48,246
We wiped what really happened
from your memory.

1263
01:48:49,556 --> 01:48:52,150
What was it?

1264
01:48:52,225 --> 01:48:54,716
You never saw Sofia again.

1265
01:48:54,828 --> 01:48:58,093
And the doctors were never able
to rebuild your face.

1266
01:48:59,299 --> 01:49:03,497
You woke up on that street
with an awful hangover.

1267
01:49:03,603 --> 01:49:05,935
You shutyourselfaway
for months.

1268
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:08,007
One dayyou learned
that we existed.

1269
01:49:09,075 --> 01:49:12,533
You came to the office,
you signed the contract...

1270
01:49:12,646 --> 01:49:14,876
and then...

1271
01:49:14,981 --> 01:49:16,949
you killedyourself.

1272
01:49:18,418 --> 01:49:20,249
I paid for this?

1273
01:49:21,288 --> 01:49:24,815
I paid for Nuria
to come back as Sofia?

1274
01:49:24,891 --> 01:49:27,155
I paid to look like
a monster again?

1275
01:49:27,227 --> 01:49:29,195
I paid to live this nightmare?

1276
01:49:29,329 --> 01:49:32,025
You paid to live
whatever you wanted.

1277
01:49:32,132 --> 01:49:34,396
We just provided the setting
and the characters.

1278
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:36,901
You invented your hell.

1279
01:49:37,003 --> 01:49:39,699
I tried to warn you
in that bar.

1280
01:49:39,773 --> 01:49:41,900
I said it all depended
on your mind.

1281
01:49:42,809 --> 01:49:45,744
Do I just have to want it?

1282
01:49:45,845 --> 01:49:48,473
- Can Antonio come--
- There's no one here.

1283
01:49:49,382 --> 01:49:52,579
They can't have made
4 million people disappear!

1284
01:49:53,853 --> 01:49:55,912
You've overcome your fears.

1285
01:49:56,022 --> 01:49:58,081
Ifyou want,
we can try again...

1286
01:49:58,191 --> 01:50:00,352
have you live
a wonderful dream...

1287
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:04,191
with money, friends, Sofia,
or whatever girl you want.

1288
01:50:04,331 --> 01:50:06,799
You just have to ask.

1289
01:50:08,668 --> 01:50:10,602
I don't want more dreams.

1290
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:12,729
It isn't a dream!

1291
01:50:12,839 --> 01:50:14,739
Cesar, listen to me.

1292
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:17,332
This is real.
This man is a sham.

1293
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:19,969
Let's go down
and look for people.

1294
01:50:20,046 --> 01:50:22,776
Ignore him. It's logical
for him to behave like this...

1295
01:50:22,849 --> 01:50:25,340
but he doesn't
feel anything.

1296
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:27,682
I don't feel anything?

1297
01:50:27,787 --> 01:50:31,314
I don't feel anything?
What do you know about what I feel?

1298
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:33,119
Ignore him, he isn't real.

1299
01:50:33,193 --> 01:50:35,855
Yes, I am real!

1300
01:50:35,962 --> 01:50:38,192
I've got a wife
and two daughters.

1301
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:42,267
His personality is designed
so that he'll say all this now.

1302
01:50:42,402 --> 01:50:45,371
Where are my daughters?
God!

1303
01:50:45,438 --> 01:50:48,498
Cesar, we can offeryou
another possibility.

1304
01:50:48,575 --> 01:50:51,806
In 1 997, it was impossible
to rebuild your face.

1305
01:50:51,911 --> 01:50:55,540
But out there,
it's the year 2 1 45.

1306
01:50:55,649 --> 01:50:58,982
You wouldn't believe
the things surgery can do.

1307
01:50:59,085 --> 01:51:01,349
You could wake up...

1308
01:51:01,454 --> 01:51:04,287
and live in the future
like a normal person.

1309
01:51:04,357 --> 01:51:07,520
- In the future?
- You have to choose.

1310
01:51:10,563 --> 01:51:12,497
How could I wake up?

1311
01:51:12,565 --> 01:51:16,763
How would you wake
from your worst nightmare?

1312
01:51:22,909 --> 01:51:24,843
No, Cesar, don't listen to him!

1313
01:51:24,911 --> 01:51:28,210
Your partners set this up!
They want you to kill yourself!

1314
01:51:28,281 --> 01:51:31,773
He's done that.
Now it'll just be a formality.

1315
01:51:33,153 --> 01:51:35,644
- I'm going to do it.
- Very well.

1316
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:41,154
Do you have any wish
before you die?

1317
01:51:55,475 --> 01:51:58,137
Let them out there read my mind.

1318
01:53:02,142 --> 01:53:03,541
Who are you?

1319
01:53:04,844 --> 01:53:06,436
I don't know.

1320
01:53:06,546 --> 01:53:10,038
Don't keep suffering.
It's all in your head.

1321
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:12,618
It's all psychological.

1322
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:40,712
Come on, Cesar.

1323
01:53:54,527 --> 01:53:57,826
- What will happen to them?
- Don't prolong this farewell.

1324
01:53:57,931 --> 01:54:01,332
You think they're your friends,
but they're just images.

1325
01:54:01,467 --> 01:54:03,458
That man isn't really crying.

1326
01:54:26,993 --> 01:54:31,020
- I forgot, I get vertigo.
- Then don't look.

1327
01:54:33,266 --> 01:54:34,756
Good-bye, Cesar.

1328
01:55:18,378 --> 01:55:19,777
Relax.

1329
01:55:22,048 --> 01:55:23,447
Relax.

1330
01:55:26,019 --> 01:55:27,987
Open your eyes.
