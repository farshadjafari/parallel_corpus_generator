1
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:52,177
Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.

2
00:00:52,427 --> 00:01:01,019
But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort,
which could only be broken by Love's first kiss.

3
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:07,609
She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible
fire breathing dragon.

4
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,992
Many brave knights had attempted to free her from
this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.

5
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:22,040
She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest
room of the tallest tower for her true love

6
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:26,253
and true love's first kiss.

7
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,714
Like that's ever going to happen.

8
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:33,552
What a loony.

9
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:56,658
Shrek

10
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,752
Beware

11
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,157
Stay out

12
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,552
I think he's in here.

13
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,845
All right. Lets get it!

14
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,848
Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

15
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,394
Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains.

16
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,981
Well actually that would be a giant.

17
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,234
Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse.

18
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,655
They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin.

19
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,576
They'll chew your livers,
squeeze the jelly from your eyes.

20
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,286
Actually, it's quite good on toast.

21
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,788
Back, back beast, back!

22
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,335
I warned you!

23
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:16,798
Right.

24
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,774
This is the part, where you run away.

25
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:38,320
Yeah!

26
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,868
And stay out.

27
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:51,250
Wanted. Fairytale creatures.

28
00:04:54,586 --> 00:05:00,342
Right, this one is full. Take it away.

29
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,137
Give me that.

30
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:07,099
Your fine days are over.
-25 pieces of silver for the witch.

31
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:12,396
Next.
-Come on.

32
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:16,567
Sit down there! And be quiet!

33
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,986
This cage is so small.

34
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,488
You wouldn't turn me in.
I'll never be stubborn again. I can change.

35
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,031
Please, give me another chance.

36
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,033
Oh, shut up!

37
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,076
Next.

38
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:26,827
What do we got?

39
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,620
This little wooden puppet.

40
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:34,042
I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy.

41
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,420
Five shillings for the possessed toy.
Take it away.

42
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,463
No! Please, don't let them do it!

43
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,090
Next. What do you got?

44
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,385
Well, I've got a talking donkey!

45
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,469
Right.

46
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,723
Well that's good for ten schillings,
if you can prove it.

47
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:52,519
Oh, go ahead fella.

48
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,896
Well?

49
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,398
He's just a li..., just a little nervous.

50
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,109
He's really quite a chatterbox.

51
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,402
You boneheaded donkey!

52
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:01,862
That's it. I have heard enough. Guards!

53
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,907
No, no, he talks, he does!

54
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,618
I can talk. I love to talk.

55
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,413
I've talked to...

56
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:17,544
Get her out of my sight! 
-No, no, I swear!

57
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,884
Hey, I can fly. 
-He can fly! -He can fly!

58
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,762
He can talk! 
-That's right, fool!

59
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,806
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey!

60
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,850
You might have seen house fly,
maybe even a superfly.

61
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:38,941
But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly!

62
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,156
Seize him!

63
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:02,589
Get him! This way! Hurry!

64
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,804
You there. Ogre. 
-I.

65
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,597
By the order of lord Farquaad.

66
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,183
I am authorized to place you
both under arrest.

67
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:19,439
And transport you to designated
resettlement facility.

68
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,149
Oh really?

69
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,238
You and what army?

70
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,248
Can I say something to you?

71
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,751
Listen, you were really, really something,
back there. Incredible.

72
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,963
Are you talking to...

73
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,382
...me?

74
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,842
Yes, I was talking to you.

75
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,644
Can I just tell you that you were
really great back there with those guards.

76
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:50,721
They thought that was all over there.

77
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,683
And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping
on over themselves like babes in the woods.

78
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,468
That really made me feel good to see that.

79
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,769
Oh, that's great. Really.

80
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,062
Man, it's good to be free.

81
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:05,135
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom
with your own friends?

82
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,904
But I...

83
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,488
I don't have any friends.

84
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,116
And I'm not going out there by myself.

85
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,618
Hey wait a minute. I have a great idea...

86
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,077
I'll stick with you.

87
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,454
You and me in green fighting machine.

88
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:21,110
Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us.

89
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,088
Oh, a, that was really scary.

90
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,709
Maybe you don't mine me saying. If that don't work,
your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause...

91
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,111
you definitively need some tic-tac or something,

92
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,722
'cause your breath stinks!

93
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,474
Man you've ???  my note!

94
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,268
Just like the time...

95
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,853
...and then I ate some rotten berries.

96
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,189
Man I had some strong gases leaking 
out of my but that day.

97
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:46,026
Why are you following me?

98
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,446
I'll tell you why.

99
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,657
'Cause I'm all alone,

100
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,786
there is no one here, beside me.

101
00:08:56,036 --> 00:09:03,001
My problems have all gone.
There's no one to derive me.

102
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:08,006
But you got to have free ... 
-Stop singing!

103
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,801
Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends.

104
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,628
Wow! Only a true friend would be that truly honest.

105
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,222
Listen! Little donkey.

106
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,434
Take a look at me! What am I?

107
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,771
A...

108
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:23,689
...really tall?

109
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:29,278
No! I'm an Ogre.
You know, grab your torch and pitchforks.

110
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,573
Doesn't that bother you?

111
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,491
Nope.

112
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,785
Really? 
-Really really.

113
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:37,828
Oh?

114
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,080
Man, I like you. What's your name?

115
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,500
A..., Shrek.

116
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,169
Shrek?!

117
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,378
But do you know, what I like about you, Shrek?

118
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,381
You've got that kind of:
"I don't care what nobody thinks of me" thing.

119
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:54,970
I like that, I respect that, Shrek. You're all right.

120
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,847
Uh, look at that.

121
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,141
Who would wanna live in
a place like that?

122
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,602
That would be my home.

123
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:06,607
Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful.
You know you're quite a decorator.

124
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,276
It's amazing what you did with such a modest budget.

125
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:15,741
I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.

126
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,454
I guess, you don't entertain much, do you?

127
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,539
I like my privacy.

128
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,833
You know I do to. 
That's another thing, we have in common.

129
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,170
Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face.
You try to give them a hint and they won't leave.

130
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,842
And then there's that big occurred silence, 
you know?

131
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,221
Can I stay with you? 
-What?

132
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,848
Can I stay with you, please.

133
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,184
Of course! 
-Really?

134
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,770
No. 
-Please! I don't want to go back there.

135
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,147
You don't how is like to be concerned like a freak.

136
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,942
Well..., maybe you do. 
But that's why we have to stick together!

137
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,277
You got to let me stay! Please! Please!

138
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,613
OK, OK.

139
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,199
-But one night only. 
-Huh, thank you!

140
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,617
A, what are you do... No!

141
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,453
This is going to be fun.
We can stay up late, swap the manly stories.

142
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,829
And in the morning...

143
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,999
I'm making waffles.

144
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,001
Where do I sleep?

145
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,754
Outside!

146
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,716
Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know,
I don't know you and you don't know me...

147
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,470
... so I guess, outside is best for me.

148
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,016
Here I go.

149
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:27,145
Good night.

150
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:31,066
I do like that half door. 
I'm a donkey all alone outside.

151
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:36,280
Sit by myself outside, I guess.

152
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:44,454
I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me.

153
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:52,564
-I thought, I told you to stay outside.
-I am outside.

154
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:00,489
Well James. This is far from the farm,
but what choice do we have?

155
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,076
It's not...

156
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,620
What a lovely bed. 
-Got you!

157
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,292
I found some cheese. Awful stuff.

158
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,586
-Is that you Gordon? 
-How did you know?

159
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:20,876
Enough! What are you doing in my house?

160
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,887
Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table!

161
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:29,560
Where would we supposed to put her.
The bed's taken.

162
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:31,478
What?

163
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:36,900
I live in a swamp. I've put up signs.
I'm a terrifying Ogre!

164
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:43,282
What do I have to do, to get a little privacy?

165
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:50,747
Oh, no! No, no!

166
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:04,678
What are you doing in my swamp?

167
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,270
All right, get out of here. All of you.
Move it! Come on, let's go.

168
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,023
And hurry up, hurry up.

169
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:22,154
No, no, not there. Not there!

170
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,824
Hey don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

171
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,702
Oh gosh, no one invited us. 
-What?

172
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,330
We were forced to come here. 
-By who?

173
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,043
Lord Farquaad. He ??? 

174
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:39,838
All right.

175
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:45,302
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is? 

176
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,554
Oh I do. I know where he is.

177
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:52,809
Does anyone else know where to find him? 

178
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,604
-Anyone at all? -Me. -Anyone?

179
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:59,650
Oh pick me, I know! Me, me.

180
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,236
Ok, fine.

181
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:07,366
Attention all fairy tale things!

182
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:11,411
Do not get comfortable.
Your welcome is officially warned up.

183
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:22,256
In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now
and get all off my land and back where you came from.

184
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:32,057
You. You're coming with me.

185
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,475
All right. That's what I like to hear, man.

186
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:39,565
Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a
world and big city adventure. I love it.

187
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:45,195
I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek!
I'm on road again...

188
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,573
What did I say about singing?

189
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:48,699
-Can I whistle? 
-No.

190
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:54,037
-Well, can I hummer? 
-All right.

191
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:27,529
That's enough. He's ready to talk.

192
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:41,418
Run, run, run as fast as you can,
you can't catch me.

193
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,837
I'm the gingerbread man.

194
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,297
You monster.

195
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,132
I'm not a monster here. You are.

196
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:51,887
You and the rest of that fairytale trash,
poisoning my perfect world.

197
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:56,391
-Now tell me! Where are the others?
-Eat me.

198
00:16:56,642 --> 00:17:01,188
I've tried to be fair to you, creatures.
Now my patience has reached its end!

199
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,149
-Tell me! Or I'll...
-No, no, not the buttons.

200
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,109
Not gumdrop buttons.

201
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,278
All right! Who's hiding them?

202
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,781
Ok, I'll tell you.

203
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:14,076
-Do you know the muffin-man?
-The muffin-man?

204
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,746
-The muffin-man.
-Yes, I know the muffin-man.

205
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,706
Who lives on Proully lane?

206
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,418
-Well, she's married to the muffin-man.
-The muffin-man!

207
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,840
-The muffin-man!
-She's married to the muffin-man.

208
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,050
My lord! We found it.

209
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,889
Well then, what are you waiting for?
Bring it in.

210
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,319
Magic mirror.

211
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,616
Don't tell him anything!

212
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,578
Evening.

213
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:03,083
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?

214
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,378
Well, technically, you're not a king.

215
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,089
A..., felonious.

216
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,133
-You were saying.
-What I mean is a...

217
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,593
...you're not a king, yet.

218
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:17,598
But you can become one.
All you have to do, is marry a princess.

219
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,766
Go on.

220
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,978
So, just sit back and relax my lord,

221
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:28,066
because it's time for you
to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.

222
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:31,320
And here they are.

223
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,949
Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused
shading from a kingdom far, far away.

224
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,619
She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime.

225
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:42,080
Her hobbies include cooking and 
cleaning for two evil sisters.

226
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,250
Please welcome... Cinderella.

227
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,504
Bachelorette number two is a
 kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy.

228
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,590
Although she lives with seven other man,
she is not easy.

229
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,302
Just kiss hers dead frozen lips
and find out what a live wife she is.

230
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:59,389
Come on. Give it up for... Show-white.

231
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,558
And last but certainly not least.

232
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,477
Bachelorette number three is a 
fire-breathing ????,

233
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:07,940
dragon guarded castle, surrounded by a hot 
boiling lava. But don't let that cool you off.

234
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,860
She's a loaded pistol who likes
Pina Coladas and getting cut in the rain.

235
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,198
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona.

236
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:20,577
So will it be, bachelorette number one?
Bachelorette number two?

237
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,955
Or bachelorette number three?

238
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:26,625
-Two... -Three! -Two!

239
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,544
One. No, no, no.

240
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,879
Three. Pick number three my lord.

241
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,966
Ok, ok. Number three.

242
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:42,516
Lord Farquaad. You've chosen...
princess Fiona.

243
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:48,564
She's nice. Fiona. She's perfect.

244
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,858
All I have to do is just find someone...

245
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,694
But I probably should mention little thing 
that happens at night...

246
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,445
-I'll do it! 
-Yes, but after sunset...

247
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,197
Silence!

248
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,658
I will make this princess Fiona my queen.

249
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:03,996
And Duloc will finally have the perfect king!

250
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,456
Captain! Assemble your finest man.

251
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:12,337
We're going to have a tournament!

252
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,340
That's it, that's, right there, that's Duloc.

253
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,009
I've told you I'll find it.

254
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,930
So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle.

255
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:24,099
Aha, that's the place.

256
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:29,688
Do you think maybe he's compensating for something.

257
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:36,528
Hey, hey wait up Shrek!

258
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,532
-Hey, you! 
-No, no!

259
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,451
Wait a second.

260
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:48,540
Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just...

261
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,116
It's quiet.

262
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:27,538
Too quiet.

263
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,457
Where is everybody?

264
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:35,212
Hey look at this.

265
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,717
Wow!

266
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:27,514
-Let's do that again. 
-No. no.

267
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,902
All right. 
You're going the right way for smack bottom.

268
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,404
Sorry about that. 

269
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,657
That champion should have the honor, no, no...

270
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:55,167
...the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely 
princess Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon.

271
00:22:55,417 --> 00:23:02,674
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful,
the first runner up will take his place.

272
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,219
And so on, and so forth.

273
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:14,061
Some of you may die,
but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

274
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,104
Applause.

275
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:22,110
Let the tournament begin.

276
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,324
What is that?

277
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,992
Ugh, it's hideous.

278
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:32,120
Oh, that's not very nice.

279
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,581
It's just a donkey.

280
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,124
Indeed.

281
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:41,463
Knights! New plan. The one, who kills the Ogre,
will be named champion.

282
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,632
How about him.

283
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:49,012
Oh, hey. Now, come on.

284
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:53,767
Can't we just settle this over a pint?

285
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:55,352
No?

286
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,438
All right then.

287
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:02,985
Come on.

288
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:36,894
Hey Shrek! Let me, let me!

289
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:51,033
The chair! Give him the chair!

290
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:15,057
Thank you. Thank you, very much.

291
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:19,478
I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel!

292
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:25,984
Shall I give the order sir?

293
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:29,780
No. I have a better idea.

294
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,910
People of Duloc. I give you our champion!

295
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,079
What?

296
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,206
Congratulation, Ogre.

297
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:43,085
You've won the honor of embarking
on a great and noble quest.

298
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,963
Quest? I'm already on a quest.

299
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,840
A quest to get my swamp back!

300
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,968
-Your swamp? 
-Yeah, my swamp!

301
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:54,638
Where you dumped those fairytale creatures.

302
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,014
Indeed.

303
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:58,267
All right Ogre, I'll make you a deal.

304
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:02,771
Go on this quest for me and
I'll give you your swamp back.

305
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:05,315
Exactly the way it was?

306
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,818
Down to the last slime covered toast tool.

307
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:12,364
-And the squatters? 
-As good as gone.

308
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:18,954
What kind of quest?

309
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:19,746
Ok, let me get this straight!

310
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:24,293
We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess 
just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp,

311
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:26,628
which you only don't have, 'cause he filled it 
with full of freaks on the first place.

312
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:28,422
-Is that about right? 
-You know what?

313
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,592
Maybe there is a good reason, donkeys shouldn't talk.

314
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:34,720
I don't get it Shrek. 
Why didn't you just pull some old Ogre stuff on them?

315
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:40,066
You know, ??? . Grab his bones to make you brave.
You know the whole Ogre trick.

316
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:46,179
Oh, you know what. Maybe I could have decapitated 
entire village and put their heads on plate.

317
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:50,652
Got a knife, cut open their spleens 
and drink their fluids.

318
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:53,572
Does that sound good to you?

319
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,282
A, no, not really, no.

320
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,994
For your information,
there is a lot more to Ogres than people think.

321
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:01,622
-Example. 
-Example?

322
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:06,168
OK, A-a-m, Ogres are like onions.

323
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:08,921
-They stink? 
-Yes, no.

324
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:10,339
-O, they make you cry. 
-No.

325
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:13,917
Oh, you leave them out on the sun and 
they get all brown and start ??? little wild hairs?

326
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:18,263
No! Layers! Onions have layers.

327
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:21,517
Ogres have layers. Onions have layers.

328
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:26,063
You get it? We both have layers.

329
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:30,651
O, you both have layers.

330
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:32,986
You know not everybody likes onions.

331
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:36,031
Cake! Everybody loves cakes. Cakes have layers.

332
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:39,868
I don't care what everyone likes.

333
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:44,414
Ogres are not like cakes.

334
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:47,918
You know what else everyone likes? Paffe.

335
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,796
Have you ever met a person and you say: 
"Hey, let's get some paffe" and

336
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,131
they say I don't like paffe. Paffe is delicious.

337
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:57,678
No! You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden.

338
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,514
Ogres are like onions. End of story.

339
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:05,060
Bye, bye. See you lather.

340
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:11,441
Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing 
on the whole damn planet.

341
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:14,194
You know I think I've preferred your humming.

342
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,780
Do you have a tissue or something, 
 'cause I'm making a mess.

343
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:21,326
Just the word paffe has made me start slimying

344
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,783
Why, Shrek, did you do that?

345
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,369
Man you got to warn somebody 
before you just crack one off.

346
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,662
My mouth was opened and everything.

347
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:10,209
Believe me donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead.

348
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:13,754
It's brimstone. We must be getting close.

349
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:16,381
Yeah, right, brimstone.

350
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:19,635
Don't be talking ??? brimstone. 
I know what I smell and ??? no brimstone.

351
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:24,181
And they don't come of stone neither.

352
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:44,159
Sure it's big enough, but look at the location.

353
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:52,125
Oh, Shrek, remember when you said 
that Ogres have layers?

354
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,503
Oh, yeah.

355
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:57,923
Well, I have a confession to make. 
Donkeys don't have layers.

356
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:00,259
We wear ??? sleeves.

357
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:02,636
Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.

358
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:07,182
-You know what I mean. 
-Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs.

359
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:11,854
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being 
on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava!

360
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:15,607
Come on donkey, I'm right here beside you. Ok?

361
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:18,402
For emotional support.

362
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:22,948
We'll just hackle this thing together
one little baby step after time.

363
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,033
-Really? 
-Really really.

364
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,302
Ok. That makes me feel so much better.

365
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:30,414
Just keep moving and don't look down.

366
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:34,960
Don't look down, don't look down.

367
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:41,675
Shrek! I'm looking down!

368
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,427
I can't do this. Just let me off right now, please.

369
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:46,889
-But you're already half way. 
-Yeah, but I know that half is safe.

370
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:49,850
Ok, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

371
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,396
Shrek, no, wait.

372
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:56,607
Don't do that!

373
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:59,860
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

374
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,864
-Oh. This? 
-Yes, that!

375
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:07,451
Yes, yes. Do it. OK.

376
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:11,997
-No, Shrek! 
-I'm doing it.

377
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:16,418
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die.

378
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:23,133
That will do Donkey, that will do.

379
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:28,639
Cool.

380
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,341
So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway?

381
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:35,145
Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her.

382
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:39,691
I was talking about the dragon Shrek.

383
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:59,253
-Are you afraid? 
-No, but shhhhh.

384
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:04,174
Oh, good. Me neither.

385
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:08,720
Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid. 
Here's a..., something responsible of the situation.

386
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:13,767
Not to mention dangerous situation. 
And there's dragon that breathes fire.

387
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:17,846
I'm sure he's meaner than a cow or anything, 
but they're scare. You know what I mean.

388
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:22,192
I'm sure he's heavier than a cow...

389
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:25,737
Donkey. Two things. Ok?

390
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:28,323
Shut, up.

391
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:30,909
Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.

392
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,345
Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess.

393
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:37,791
The princess will be up the stairs in the 
highest room in the tallest tower.

394
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,169
What makes you think she'll be there?

395
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:42,754
I read it in a book once.

396
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:46,800
Cool. You handle the dragon, I'll handle the stairs.

397
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,553
Oh, I'll find those stairs. I'll ???. That's right.

398
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:54,099
Those stairs won't know which way they go.

399
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,729
The drafting stairs, ???

400
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:01,815
Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. 
I'm master of the stairs.

401
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:06,361
I wish I had a stair right here right here now, 
I'd step all over it.

402
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,074
Well, at least we know where the princess is.

403
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:15,621
-But where is the... 
-Dragon!

404
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:34,306
Donkey, look out!

405
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:46,570
Got you.

406
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:27,860
Oh, what large teeth you have.

407
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,487
I mean, white sparkling teeth.

408
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,656
You probably hear this all the time from your food, but

409
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:36,368
you must bleach yourself, 
because that is one dashing smile you got there.

410
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:39,329
And do I detect the hint of minty freshness?

411
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,249
And you know what else?

412
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:47,795
You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure. 
I mean 'course you're a girl dragon,

413
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:53,135
'cause you're just ricking the feminine beauty out.

414
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,556
What's the matter with you? 
Do you have something in your eye?

415
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,143
Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know 
I'm a asthmatic and

416
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:04,354
I don't know if we would worked out. 
You'd be blowing smoke and stuff.

417
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:08,609
Shrek!

418
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:13,155
No, Shrek! Shrek!

419
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:46,730
-Wake up! 
-What?

420
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,274
Are you princess Fiona?

421
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:51,276
I am.

422
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:54,071
Awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

423
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,323
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go.

424
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:58,534
But wait, sir knight.

425
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,702
This be our first meeting.

426
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:04,414
Should not be wonderful, romantic moment?

427
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:07,793
Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time.

428
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:11,288
Hey, what are you doing? 
You know, you should sweep me out of my feet.

429
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:15,092
Out through the window and down 
the rope by to your valued steed.

430
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,302
You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

431
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:21,849
Uh-um.

432
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:24,518
But we have to sing through this moment.

433
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,354
You can residing of a poem to me.

434
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:31,900
A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti. Or something.

435
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,652
I don't think so.

436
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:38,198
Well, can I at least know a name of my champion?

437
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:40,868
Shrek.

438
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:43,662
So, Shrek.

439
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:48,208
I pray that you take this favor 
as a token of my gratitude.

440
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:54,298
Thanks.

441
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:59,887
-You didn't slay the dragon? 
-It's not my job to do this. Now, come on!

442
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,516
But this isn't right. ???

443
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:06,852
That's what all the other knights did.

444
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:09,980
Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame.

445
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,983
That's not the point.

446
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:15,569
Wait. Where are you going? Exit is over there.

447
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,363
Well, I have to save my ass.

448
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:21,491
What kind of knight are you?

449
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:26,038
One of a kind.

450
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:36,882
...rush into a physical relationship.

451
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:41,386
I'm not that emotionally ready 
for commitment of a this  magnitude.

452
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:44,014
That was the word I was looking for. Magnitude.

453
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,642
Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.

454
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,560
Hey, what are you doing?

455
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,064
Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and 
take this one step at the time.

456
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:54,558
I mean, we really should get to know each other first, 
you know what am I saying.

457
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:58,904
As friends, maybe even as ???

458
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:05,410
Hey don't do that. That's my tail. 
That's ma personal tail.

459
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:09,957
And you're going to tear it off....

460
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:17,339
Oh, no. No!

461
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:48,203
-It talks?! 
-Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick.

462
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:28,327
Ok, you two. Head for the exit.

463
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:32,831
I'll take care of the dragon.

464
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:41,089
Ruuuuun!

465
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:29,680
You did it. You rescued me.

466
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,226
Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a ...

467
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,230
...a little unorthodox I admit, but

468
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,776
by deed is great and by heart is pure. 
I'm entirely in your debt.

469
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:51,076
And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed.

470
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:53,912
I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed.

471
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:56,623
She thinks I'm a steed.

472
00:40:56,874 --> 00:41:01,170
The battle is won. 
You may remove your helmet good sir knight.

473
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:04,923
-Aah, no. 
-Why not?

474
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:06,466
I have helmet hair.

475
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:09,603
Please. I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer.

476
00:41:09,753 --> 00:41:12,306
Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust.

477
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:14,850
But, how will you kiss me?

478
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,396
What? That wasn't in a job description.

479
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:23,025
-Maybe it's a perk? 
-No. It's destiny.

480
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:25,819
You must know how it goes.

481
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:32,365
A princess locked in a tower and besieged 
by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight.

482
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:36,413
And then they share true love's first kiss.

483
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:39,041
With Shrek? You think, wait...

484
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:41,502
...you think Shrek is your true love?

485
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:46,048
Well, yes.

486
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:49,885
You think that Shrek is your true love.

487
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:52,095
What is so funny?

488
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:54,848
Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok?

489
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:58,644
Of course you are. You're my rescuer.

490
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:00,854
Now, now remove your helmet.

491
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:03,390
Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

492
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,317
-Just take off the helmet. 
-I'm not going to.

493
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:06,527
-Take it off! 
-No!

494
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:10,531
-Now! 
-Ok, easy.

495
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:15,077
As you command your highness.

496
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:28,048
You're an Ogre.

497
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:30,926
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

498
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:35,472
Well, yes, actually.

499
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:40,819
Oh no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an Ogre.

500
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:46,400
Princess, I was sent to rescue you by lord Farquaad, ok?

501
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,443
He's the one, who wants to marry you.

502
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:50,946
Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me?

503
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:54,491
Good question. 
You should ask him that, when we get there.

504
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:57,744
But I have to be rescued by my true love.

505
00:42:57,995 --> 00:43:00,831
Not by some Ogre and his pet.

506
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:02,749
Well so much for noble steed.

507
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,535
Look princess. You're not making my job any easier.

508
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:08,881
Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.

509
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:14,327
You can tell lord Farquaad 
that if he wants to rescue me properly,

510
00:43:14,569 --> 00:43:16,763
I'll be waiting for him right here.

511
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:20,475
Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right?

512
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:25,022
-I'm a delivery boy. 
-You wouldn't dare.

513
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:26,815
-You coming donkey? 
-Put me down!

514
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:28,692
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

515
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:31,945
Put me down or you will suffer the consequences.

516
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:36,533
This is not dignified. Put me down.

517
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,988
Ok, here's another question. Let's say that a woman 
'digged' you, but you don't really like her,

518
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:45,325
that way. Now, how you let her down real easy, 
so her feelings aren't hurt?

519
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:48,186
But you don't get burned to a crisp neither. 
How do you do this?

520
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:50,422
Just tell her, she's not your true love.

521
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:53,842
Everyone knows it what happens when you find...

522
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:58,588
Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc, the better.

523
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:01,308
Oh, yeah. You gonna love it there princess. 
It's beautiful.

524
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:05,178
And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad. 
What's he like?

525
00:44:05,229 --> 00:44:08,106
Well, let me put it this way, princess.

526
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:12,694
Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.

527
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:17,824
Oh no, Shrek. There are those who think little of him.

528
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:22,788
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

529
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:27,534
You know, you're just jealous that you can never 
measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad.

530
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:34,606
Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess. But I'd like 
you do that measuring when you see him tomorrow

531
00:44:34,983 --> 00:44:37,219
Tomorrow?

532
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:39,179
It will take that long?

533
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:43,725
-Shouldn't we stop to make camp? 
-No. That would take longer.

534
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:44,893
We can keep going.

535
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:48,021
But there are robbers in the woods.

536
00:44:48,272 --> 00:44:51,266
Whoa, time out Shrek. 
Camp is definitely something that sounds good.

537
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:55,237
Hey. Come on. 
I'm scarier than anything we're gonna see in this forest.

538
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:59,783
I need to find somewhere to camp, now!

539
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,832
Hey, over here.

540
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:11,378
Shrek, we can do better than that. 
Now, I don't think this is decent for princess.

541
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:14,756
No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

542
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:19,303
Homey touches? Like what?

543
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,388
A door.

544
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:23,932
Well, gentleman I'll be d..., good night.

545
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:26,301
Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story, 
'cause I will...

546
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:30,647
I said good night!

547
00:45:32,282 --> 00:45:34,860
Shrek! What are you doing?

548
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,486
I just..., you know...

549
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:41,033
Oh, come on, I was just kidding.

550
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:48,498
And that one, that's Throwback.

551
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:52,211
The only Ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.

552
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:56,381
Right. Yeah.

553
00:45:56,532 --> 00:45:58,133
Hey, can you tell my future form these stars?

554
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:00,385
Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey.

555
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:03,222
They tell stories. Look.

556
00:46:03,372 --> 00:46:05,349
There's Blodna, the "Flatulent"

557
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,809
You can guess what he is famous for.

558
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,520
All right. Now I know you're making this up.

559
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:14,066
No. Look. There he is and there's the group of hunters 
running away from his stag.

560
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:18,028
Man, there ain't nothing, but a bunch of little dots.

561
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:22,574
You know donkey, 
sometimes things are more than they appear.

562
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:28,705
Forget it.

563
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:33,168
Hey Shrek. 
What are you gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway?

564
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:37,214
-Our swamp? 
-You know. When we're through rescuing the princess 
 and all that stuff.

565
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:41,343
We? Donkey, there is no we. There's no our.

566
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:43,679
There's just me and my swamp.

567
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:48,225
And the first thing I'm gonna do,
is build a ten foot wall around my land.

568
00:46:49,726 --> 00:46:54,022
You cut me deep Shrek, you cut me real deep just now.

569
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:58,894
You know, what I think? I think this whole wall thing 
is just a way to keep somebody out.

570
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:03,073
No, do you think?

571
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:06,493
-Are you hiding something? 
-Never mind Donkey.

572
00:47:06,743 --> 00:47:09,788
Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

573
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:13,250
No. This is one of those drop it and leave it alone things.

574
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,045
-Why don't you want to talk about it? 
-Why do you want to talk about it?

575
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:19,590
-Oh, Why you block?
-I'm not blocking. 
-Oh yes you are.

576
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,135
-Donkey, I'm warning you. 
-Who are you trying to keep out? 
 Just tell me that Shrek. Who?

577
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,888
Everyone, ok?

578
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:30,434
-Oh, now we're getting somewhere. 
-Oh, for 'the love of pit'.

579
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:34,354
Hey, what's your problem Shrek? 
What do you got against the whole world anyway?

580
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:36,648
Look. I'm not the one with the problem, ok?

581
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:39,610
It's the world that seems to have a problem with me.

582
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,822
People take one look at me and go: AAA... Help! Run!

583
00:47:43,972 --> 00:47:48,368
A big stupid ugly Ogre.

584
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:51,755
They judge me, before they even know me.

585
00:47:52,006 --> 00:47:56,302
That's why I'm better off alone.

586
00:48:03,075 --> 00:48:07,471
You know what? When we met, 
I didn't think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.

587
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:13,268
Yeah, I know.

588
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:16,480
So, a... Are there any donkeys up there?

589
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:21,026
Well, there's a Cabby. The small and annoying.

590
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:26,532
Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big shining one, right there. 
That one, over there?

591
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:31,745
That's the moon.

592
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:57,104
Again. Show me again.

593
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:02,943
Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess.

594
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:13,161
Perfect.

595
00:50:16,217 --> 00:50:20,812
Yeah. You know I like like that. Oh come on baby...

596
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:25,150
-Donkey. Wake up. 
-What? -Wake up.

597
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:30,405
Morning. How do you like your eggs?

598
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:34,209
-Good morning princess. 
-What's all this about?

599
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:39,456
You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday 
and I wanted to make it up to you.

600
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:44,586
I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

601
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:48,173
Thanks.

602
00:50:48,423 --> 00:50:52,719
Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

603
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:00,394
-Shrek! 
-What? It's a compliment.

604
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:03,213
Better out than in I always say.

605
00:51:03,364 --> 00:51:06,984
But that's no way to behave in front of a princess.

606
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:10,863
-Thanks. 
-She's as nasty as you are.

607
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:14,533
You know. You're not exactly what I've expected.

608
00:51:14,783 --> 00:51:19,079
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people 
before you get to know them.

609
00:51:25,394 --> 00:51:28,163
Princess!

610
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:30,048
What are you doing?

611
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:38,595
???mon shery, for I am your saviour. 
And I am rescuing you from this green...beast.

612
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:42,853
Hey! That's my princess. Go find your own.

613
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:47,399
Please, monster. Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

614
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:51,862
Look, pal. I don't know who you think you are.

615
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:53,822
Oh, of course. How rude that was.

616
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:58,368
Please, let me introduce myself. Oh marry men!

617
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:47,459
Man, that was annoying.

618
00:52:47,709 --> 00:52:52,005
Oh, you little...

619
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:21,034
Shall we?

620
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:25,080
???all the forin???

621
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:28,333
Whoa, hold on, now. Where did that come from?

622
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:32,171
-What? 
-That. Back there. That was amazing.

623
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:33,755
Where did you learn that?

624
00:53:34,006 --> 00:53:39,502
Well, when one lives alone one has to learn 
these things in case there's a...

625
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:41,346
There is an arrow in your butt.

626
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:44,183
What? Oh, would you look at that.

627
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:47,311
Oh, no... This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

628
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:51,190
-What's wrong? 
-Shrek's hurt. 
-Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt!

629
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,734
-Oh, no. Shrek's going to die. 
-Donkey, I'm ok.

630
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:56,403
You can't do this to me Shrek. 
I'm too young for you to die.

631
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:57,988
Keep your legs elevated. Turn your head ???.

632
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:01,241
-Does anyone know how to handle... 
-Donkey! Calm down.

633
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:05,787
If you want to help Shrek, run into woods and 
find me a blue flower with red thorns.

634
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:10,334
Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it. 
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

635
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:12,878
Don't die Shrek. 
And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

636
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:17,090
-Donkey! 
-Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. 
 Blue flower, red thorns.

637
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:21,178
-What are the flowers for? 
-For getting rid of the Donkey.

638
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:23,722
Now, you hold still and I'll yank this thing out.

639
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:27,809
-Hey! Easy with the yanking. 
-I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

640
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,438
No, no. It's tender. 
What you're doing here is the opposite...

641
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:37,984
-Don't move. 
-Ok, look. Time out. 
-Would you... Ok.

642
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:40,197
What do you propose we do?

643
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:42,533
Blue flower, red thorns. 
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

644
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:44,952
This would be so much easier if I wasn't colorblind.

645
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:47,120
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

646
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:50,667
Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming!

647
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:54,086
Not good.

648
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:58,632
Ok, ok, I can lose it. It's just about it.

649
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,263
Nothing happened.

650
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:06,181
We were just a...

651
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:09,142
Look if you want to be alone, 
all you had to do is ask, ok?

652
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:12,771
Oh, come on. That's the last thing on my mind.

653
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:17,317
The princess here was just... Au!

654
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:26,368
Hey, what's that? Is that...

655
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:58,585
There it is, princess.

656
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:01,547
-Your future awaits you. 
-That's Duloc?

657
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:07,293
Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things lord Farquaad is 
compensating for something, which I think needs, he has a

658
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:11,765
I guess we better move on.

659
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:16,311
Sure, but Shrek...

660
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:17,980
-I'm worried about Donkey. 
-What?

661
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:21,692
I mean. Look at him. He doesn't look so good.

662
00:57:21,942 --> 00:57:24,444
-What are you talking about? I'm fine. 
-Well, that's what they always say.

663
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:28,574
And the next thing you know you're on your back.

664
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:31,952
-Dead! 
-You know she's right. You look awful.

665
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:35,414
-Do you want to sit down? 
-You know, I'll make you up some tea.

666
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:36,874
Well, I won't say nothing, but

667
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:40,419
I've got this twinge in my neck. 
And if I turn my neck like this, look. Au, see?

668
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:43,630
-He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner. 
-I'll get the firewood.

669
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:50,177
Hey, where are you going? Oh man, I can't feel my thumbs.
I don't have any thumbs!!!

670
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:54,059
I think I need a hug.

671
00:58:00,772 --> 00:58:05,068
This is good. This is really good.

672
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:08,655
-What is this? 
-Wheat rat.

673
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:13,202
-Rotisserie style. 
-No kidding.

674
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:16,788
-Oh, this is delicious. 
-Well, they also great in stews.

675
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:21,335
Now, I don't mean to brag, 
but I make a mean wheat rat stew.

676
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:29,885
I guess I'll be dining a little different 
late tomorrow night.

677
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:34,097
Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime.

678
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:36,558
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.

679
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:41,104
Swamp toast, soup fish, eye tartar. You name it.

680
00:58:42,406 --> 00:58:44,902
I'd like that.

681
00:58:53,011 --> 00:59:00,207
-Ah... , princess? 
-Yes, Shrek?

682
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:05,170
I'm a.... I was wondering.

683
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,716
Are you... a...

684
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:14,805
Are you gonna eat that?

685
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:22,437
Man, isn't this romantic. Just look at that sunset.

686
00:59:22,688 --> 00:59:26,984
Sunset?! Oh, no. It's late. It's very late.

687
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:31,321
-What? 
-Wait a minute. I see what's going on here.

688
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:33,282
You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you?

689
00:59:33,532 --> 00:59:37,828
Yes, yes. That's it. That's, I'm terrified. 
You know I'll better go inside.

690
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:40,581
But don't feel bad, princess. 
I used to be afraid of the dark too.

691
00:59:40,831 --> 00:59:45,127
Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

692
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:50,424
-Good night. 
-Good night.

693
00:59:53,303 --> 00:59:56,597
Ahh. Now I really see what's going on here.

694
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:58,599
Oh, what are you talking about.

695
00:59:58,749 --> 01:00:00,976
Hey I don't wanna even hear. 
Look, I'm an animal and I got instincts.

696
01:00:01,226 --> 01:00:03,437
And I know that you two are digging on each other. 
I can feel it.

697
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:07,983
Oh, you're crazy. 
I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

698
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:10,402
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the fairemones.

699
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:13,197
Just go in there and tell her how you feel.

700
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:17,784
There's nothing to tell. 
Besides, even if I did tell her that... well you know.

701
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:22,915
I'm not saying that I do, 'cause I don't.

702
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:25,751
She's a princess and I'm...

703
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:28,212
...an Ogre.

704
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:31,173
Yeah, an Ogre.

705
01:00:31,423 --> 01:00:35,719
-Hey, where are you going? 
-To get more firewood.

706
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:58,700
Princess. Princess Fiona?

707
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:07,751
Princess, where are you?

708
01:01:11,088 --> 01:01:15,384
Princess?

709
01:01:17,094 --> 01:01:21,390
It's very spooky in here and are we playing little games.

710
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:33,443
-No, no.
-Help! Shrek! Shrek!

711
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:35,362
-No. -Shrek! 
-It's ok. It's ok.

712
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:38,657
-What did you do with the princess? 
-Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess.

713
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:43,203
-It's me, in this body. 
-Oh my god. You ate the princess.

714
01:01:43,662 --> 01:01:45,080
-Can you hear me? 
-Donkey!

715
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,500
Listen, keep breathing. I'll get you out of there!

716
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,461
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

717
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:56,008
This is me.

718
01:01:58,343 --> 01:02:02,181
Princess? What happened to you?

719
01:02:02,431 --> 01:02:06,059
You're a... different.

720
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:08,320
-I'm ugly, ok? 
-Yeah.

721
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:11,607
Was it something that you ate? 
'Cause I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea.

722
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:17,153
-You are what you eat, I say. 
-No. I've been this way as long as I can remember.

723
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:20,407
What do you mean? 
Look, I've never seen you like this before.

724
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:24,953
It only happens when the sun goes down.

725
01:02:25,087 --> 01:02:33,083
By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm 
until you find true love's first kiss.

726
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:38,675
Then, take love's true form...

727
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:43,931
-Oh, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry. 
-It's the spell.

728
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:49,728
When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.

729
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:54,274
Every night I become this. This horrible ugly beast.

730
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:03,325
I was placed in a tower to await the day 
when my true love would rescue me.

731
01:03:03,825 --> 01:03:11,121
That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow, 
before the sun sets and he sees me, like this?

732
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:18,298
All right, all right. Calm down. 
Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly.

733
01:03:18,423 --> 01:03:22,719
Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly. But you only look like this at night.

734
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:24,888
Shrek's ugly 24/7.

735
01:03:25,138 --> 01:03:30,434
But Donkey, I'm a princess. 
And this is not how a princess is meant to look.

736
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:35,816
Princess. How about if you don't marry Farquaad?

737
01:03:36,066 --> 01:03:40,362
I have to. Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell.

738
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:44,449
But you know, you're kind of an Ogre.

739
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,911
And Shrek... Well you've got a lot in common.

740
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:49,621
Shrek?

741
01:03:49,872 --> 01:03:56,168
Princess, I... How is it going first of all? 
Good? Good for me to. I'm ok.

742
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:01,842
I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty.

743
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:07,388
And, well, I don't really like it, but I thought 
you may like it, because you're pretty.

744
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:12,394
But I like you anyway. A....

745
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:17,316
I'm in trouble. Ok, here we go.

746
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:27,826
Who could ever love a piece so hideous and ugly? 
Princess and ugly don't go together.

747
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:34,748
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek, but only chance 
to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

748
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:41,798
Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be.

749
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:45,844
It's the only way to break the spell.

750
01:04:45,904 --> 01:04:47,846
Well, at least you've got tell Shrek the truth.

751
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:50,891
No, no. You can't breathe the word. 
No one must ever know.

752
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:53,602
What's the point of being unable to talk? 
You got to keep secrets.

753
01:04:53,852 --> 01:04:56,104
Promise you won't tell. Promise!

754
01:04:56,355 --> 01:05:00,651
All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should.

755
01:05:00,026 --> 01:05:02,861
You know, before this is over, 
I'm going to need whole lot of serious therapies.

756
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:07,407
Look at my eye twitching.

757
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,976
I tell him, I tell him not.

758
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:37,980
I tell him. I tell him not.

759
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,815
I tell him!

760
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:44,361
Shrek! Shrek! There's something I want ...

761
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:09,887
Shrek. Are you all right?

762
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:12,806
Perfect. Never been better.

763
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:16,310
I... There's something I have to tell you.

764
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,355
You don't have to tell me anything, princess. 
I heard enough last night.

765
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:23,442
-You've heard what I said? 
-Every word.

766
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:24,735
I thought you'd understand?

767
01:06:24,985 --> 01:06:30,281
Oh, I understand! 
Like you said, who could love a hideous, ugly beast!

768
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:36,496
-I thought that wouldn't matter to you. 
-Yeah, well, it does.

769
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:43,219
Ah, right on time. Princess. 
I brought you a little something.

770
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:53,555
What I missed?  What I missed?

771
01:06:55,933 --> 01:07:00,229
-Princess Fiona. 
-As promised. Now hand it over.

772
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:06,150
Very well, Ogre. The deed to your swamp. 
Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go.

773
01:07:07,069 --> 01:07:10,113
Before I change my mind.

774
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:14,701
Forgive me princess for startling you, 
but you startled me.

775
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:18,455
For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before.

776
01:07:18,705 --> 01:07:23,001
-I am lord Farquaad. 
-Lord Farquaad?

777
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:33,582
Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for 
I was just saying short... farewell.

778
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:38,350
Oh. That is so sweet. 
You don't have to raise good manners on the Ogre.

779
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:43,647
-It's not like it has feelings. 
-No. You're right. It doesn't.

780
01:07:45,566 --> 01:07:49,319
Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona,

781
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:55,866
I ask your hand in marriage. 
Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

782
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:05,460
Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make...

783
01:08:05,711 --> 01:08:09,173
Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wedd...

784
01:08:09,423 --> 01:08:13,302
No! I mean I... Why wait?

785
01:08:13,552 --> 01:08:17,472
Let's get married today. Before sunset.

786
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:21,268
Oh, anxious are we? You're right. The sooner, the better.

787
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:24,038
There's so much to do.

788
01:08:24,088 --> 01:08:28,984
There is the camera, the cake, the band, the guests... 
Captain! Round up some guests.

789
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,446
Farewell Ogre.

790
01:08:32,696 --> 01:08:34,781
Shrek, what are you doing? 
You let her get away.

791
01:08:35,032 --> 01:08:38,911
-Yeah, so what. 
-Shrek. There's something about her that you don't know.

792
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:42,873
-I talked to her last night. She's... 
-Yeah I know you talked to her last night.

793
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:47,419
You're great pal, aren't you? Now, if you two are such 
good friend, why didn't you follow her home?

794
01:08:48,295 --> 01:08:51,423
-Shrek. I want to go with you. 
-I told you, didn't I?

795
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:56,969
You're not coming home with me. 
I live alone. My swamp, me and nobody else!

796
01:08:57,363 --> 01:09:04,059
Understand? Nobody! 
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

797
01:09:05,062 --> 01:09:09,358
-But. I thought... 
-Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong.

798
01:09:11,902 --> 01:09:16,198
Shrek.

799
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:37,089
Donkey?

800
01:11:37,339 --> 01:11:38,215
What are you doing?

801
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:41,552
I was thinking of all the people, 
you would recognize a wall when you see one.

802
01:11:41,802 --> 01:11:46,698
Well, yeah. But the wall supposed to go around my swamp. 
Not through it.

803
01:11:46,807 --> 01:11:49,476
It is around your half. 
See? That's your half and this is my half.

804
01:11:49,726 --> 01:11:52,354
Oh, your half?

805
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:55,482
Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.

806
01:11:55,732 --> 01:12:00,028
I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me 
that big old rock, the one that looks like your head

807
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:03,365
-Back off! 
-No. You back off!

808
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:05,284
-This is my swamp. 
-Our swamp.

809
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:07,119
-Let go, Donkey! 
-You let go!

810
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:09,204
-Stubborn jackass. 
-Smelly Ogre.

811
01:12:09,454 --> 01:12:11,373
Fine!

812
01:12:11,623 --> 01:12:13,792
Hey, hey, come back here. 
I'm not through with you, yet.

813
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:18,338
-Well, I'm through with you! 
-Well, you know. You were always me, me, me.

814
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:20,841
Well, guess what? Now it's my turn!

815
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:24,761
So you just shut up and pay attention!

816
01:12:24,912 --> 01:12:28,015
You are mean to me, you insult me, 
you don't appreciate anything that I do!

817
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:30,475
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

818
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:35,022
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, 
how come you came back?

819
01:12:35,147 --> 01:12:38,567
Because that's what friend do. 
They forgive each other!

820
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:44,571
Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey. 
I forgive you for stabbing me in the back!

821
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:51,580
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy.
You're afraid of your own feelings.

822
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:55,042
-Go away. 
-See? There you are, doing it again.
 Just like you did it to Fiona.

823
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:57,544
And all she ever do, was like you. 
Maybe even love you.

824
01:12:57,794 --> 01:13:02,090
Love me? She said I was ugly! A hideous creature.

825
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:06,512
-I heard that you two were talking. 
-She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about...

826
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:10,724
...somebody else.

827
01:13:10,974 --> 01:13:15,270
She wasn't talking about me? 
Well then, who was she talking about?

828
01:13:15,979 --> 01:13:19,441
No way, I'm not saying anything. 
You won't listen to me, right? Right?

829
01:13:19,691 --> 01:13:21,985
-Donkey. 
-No!

830
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:26,532
Ok, look. I'm sorry, all right?

831
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:34,164
I'm sorry.

832
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:38,710
I guess I am just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.

833
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:43,882
Can you forgive me?

834
01:13:43,974 --> 01:13:47,135
-Hey, that's the friends are for, right? 
-Right.

835
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:50,848
-Friends? 
-Friends.

836
01:13:51,098 --> 01:13:55,394
So? What did Fiona said about me?

837
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,231
Why are you asking me for? 
Why don't you just go ask her.

838
01:13:59,481 --> 01:14:02,985
The wedding! We'll never make it in time!

839
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:05,237
Never fear! For where there is a will, 
there is a way.

840
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:09,783
And I have I way.

841
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:14,746
Donkey?

842
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:20,293
-I guess this is just my act of magnetism. 
-Oh, come here, you.

843
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:23,463
All right. All right. 
Don't get all started. No one likes kissass.

844
01:14:23,714 --> 01:14:25,507
All right, hop on. Hold on tight.

845
01:14:25,757 --> 01:14:30,053
I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts, yet.

846
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:11,088
People of Duloc. We gather here today 
to bear witness to reunion of our new king...

847
01:15:11,261 --> 01:15:15,557
Excuse me. Could you just skip ahead to "I do's"?

848
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:19,521
Go on.

849
01:15:21,774 --> 01:15:28,070
Go ahead and have some fun,
if we need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

850
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:31,782
Shrek, wait, wait a minute. 
You want to do this right, don't you?

851
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:35,160
-What are you talking about? 
-It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for.

852
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,704
The priest is going to say: 
"Speak now or forever hold your peace".

853
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:40,249
And that's where you say: "I object".

854
01:15:40,499 --> 01:15:43,627
-I don't have time for this. 
-Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!

855
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:45,087
Look, you love this woman, don't you?

856
01:15:45,337 --> 01:15:46,296
-Yes. 
-You want to hold her!

857
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:48,674
-Yes. 
-Please her! 
-Yes!

858
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:52,052
Then you got to, got to try a little tender love.

859
01:15:52,202 --> 01:15:56,598
-The chicks love that romantic crap. 
-All right. Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?

860
01:15:57,516 --> 01:15:59,151
We got to check it out.

861
01:15:59,201 --> 01:16:02,271
And as so by the power of these two...

862
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:04,231
What do you see?

863
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:08,777
-I now pronounce you... 
-There they go!

864
01:16:10,729 --> 01:16:14,783
-...he all ready said it. 
-Oh, for 'the love of pit'.

865
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:17,619
I object!

866
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:19,413
Shrek?

867
01:16:19,663 --> 01:16:23,959
Oh, now what does he want?

868
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:28,964
Hi, everyone. Having a good time, aren't you?

869
01:16:29,214 --> 01:16:30,883
I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.

870
01:16:31,133 --> 01:16:35,429
-What are you doing here? 
-Really, it's rude enough being alive, when no one wants you.

871
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:37,848
But showing up uninvited to a wedding...

872
01:16:38,098 --> 01:16:42,394
-Fiona! I need to talk to you. 
-Oh, now you wanna talk?

873
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:45,147
Well it's a little late for that. 
So if you'll excuse me.

874
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:47,900
-But you can't marry him!
-And why not?

875
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:52,446
Because, because he's just marrying you 
so he can be king.

876
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:55,866
-Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him. 
-He's not your true love.

877
01:16:56,116 --> 01:17:01,712
-What do you know about true love? 
-Well, I ...I'm in...

878
01:17:01,788 --> 01:17:05,083
Oh, this is precious.

879
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:09,630
The Ogre has fallen in love with the princess.

880
01:17:10,172 --> 01:17:14,468
Laugh.

881
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:22,559
Shrek. Is this true?

882
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:30,105
Who cares. It's preposterious. Fiona, my love, we gonna kiss 
away for our happily ever after. Now kiss me!

883
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:40,494
By night one way, by day another.

884
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:45,999
I wanted to show you before.

885
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:11,525
Well. That explains a lot.

886
01:18:12,409 --> 01:18:17,905
Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards. 
I order you to get them out of my sight.

887
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:22,995
-Now! Get them! Get them, both! 
-No!

888
01:18:24,121 --> 01:18:28,417
This marriage is minding,  and that makes me king. See? See?

889
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,835
-Shrek! 
-No.

890
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:34,381
-Don't just stand there, you dogs. 
-Get out of my way.

891
01:18:42,472 --> 01:18:45,184
No! Shrek!

892
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:47,728
-And as for you my wife.
-Fiona!

893
01:18:47,978 --> 01:18:52,274
I'll have you locked back in that tower 
for the rest of your days!

894
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:57,487
I will have order. I will have potential. 
I will have...

895
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:07,247
All right, nobody move! 
I got a dragon here and I'm not afraid to use it.

896
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:11,919
I'm a donkey on the edge!

897
01:19:13,295 --> 01:19:17,591
Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

898
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:22,346
Go ahead Shrek.

899
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:26,892
-Fiona? 
-Yes, Shrek?

900
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:31,522
I love you.

901
01:19:31,813 --> 01:19:34,358
Really?

902
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:38,028
Really, really.

903
01:19:38,278 --> 01:19:42,574
I love you too.

904
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:53,669
A time for true love's first kiss...

905
01:20:28,328 --> 01:20:32,624
Fiona?

906
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:37,504
Fiona? Are you all right?

907
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:43,343
Yes. But I don't understand.

908
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:47,890
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

909
01:20:48,599 --> 01:20:52,895
But you are beautiful.

910
01:20:52,936 --> 01:20:57,232
I was hoping this would be a happy ending.

911
01:21:43,054 --> 01:21:46,950
God bless us, everyone.

912
01:22:50,888 --> 01:22:55,184
The End.
