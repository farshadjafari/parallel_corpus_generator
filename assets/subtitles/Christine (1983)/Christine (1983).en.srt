Don't go anywhere else.
You've got enough trouble.

164
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:20,365
Now...

165
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:24,873
if you don't empty your pockets
right now, I'm gonna call the cops.

166
00:14:36,953 --> 00:14:38,443
Go to the office, Buddy.

167
00:14:44,662 --> 00:14:46,596
I'll fix you!

168
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,326
You're gonna wish you were
never fucking born!

169
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:07,711
So, all in all,
it wasn't a bad first day.

170
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:13,293
Think Repperton
will try to get even?

171
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,520
No, he's a douche bag.

172
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:18,224
He'll find somebody
else to pick on.

173
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:21,326
- They kicked him out, you know.
- Good.

174
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,562
They kick Moochie out?

175
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,765
Probation.

176
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,774
Those assholes.

177
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:32,176
Stop the car! Quick!
Go back!

178
00:15:32,246 --> 00:15:34,272
- What's the matter?
- I want to look at her!

179
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,511
- All right, Arnie.
- Just go back. All right?

180
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:38,519
Jesus Christ.

181
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:47,864
What is it?

182
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,727
Do you know someone who lives here?

183
00:15:59,677 --> 00:16:01,110
What?

184
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:10,321
Jesus.

185
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:27,474
Be careful, Dennis.

186
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:33,778
- This is a piece of shit,
- She could be fixed up.

187
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:36,750
- Yeah.
- Oh, she could be really tough.

188
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:45,817
Forget it. This baby's got
93,000 miles on it.

189
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:49,090
Probably 193.

190
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:51,134
I don't care.

191
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:54,602
- I bet it won't even start.
- She'll start.

192
00:16:54,671 --> 00:16:57,606
You need these.

193
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,309
How much do you want for her?

194
00:17:06,384 --> 00:17:09,752
- Whatever it is, it's not enough.
- Jesus, Arnie.

195
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:21,601
Sonny, you ever owned a car before?

196
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:27,467
- Yeah, he owns a Mustang--
- No. I just got my license.

197
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:31,036
Name's George LeBay.

198
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:35,145
Arnie Cunningham.
What are you asking?

199
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:37,617
Start her up.

200
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:41,055
Really?

201
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:50,365
Her name's Christine.

202
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,737
I like that.

203
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,435
Come on. We gotta get going.

204
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,671
My asshole brother
bought her in September, '57.

205
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:04,044
You got your new model year
in September.

206
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:06,640
Brand-new, she was.

207
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,585
She had the smell
of a brand-new car.

208
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:14,025
About the finest smell in the world,
except maybe for pussy.

209
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:18,923
When he got her,
she had six miles on the odometer.

210
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,233
Goddamn Roland went through hell
and back with Christine.

211
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:27,667
lf your brother loves this car so much,
why is he selling it?

212
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:32,169
'Cause he's stone cold dead.

213
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:34,839
Died six weeks ago.

214
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,182
So, Mr. LeBay...

215
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:39,880
how much do you want for her?

216
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:42,685
I've been asking 300.

217
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:45,823
I'll make it 250 for you.

218
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:49,454
250? This isn't worth 50 bucks.

219
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:52,762
The money's not important,
and there'll be no bringing her back here...

220
00:18:52,835 --> 00:18:55,236
'cause I'm selling this shit hole
and buying me a condo.

221
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:57,296
You got a deal.

222
00:18:57,374 --> 00:18:59,807
I'll get the pink slip.

223
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:07,105
Will you stop and think about this
for a moment?

224
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:09,550
- Where are you getting the money?
- I've been saving all summer.

225
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:12,715
- For college.
- You already have a car.

226
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,623
He's screwing you.

227
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:17,059
You could get a decent car
for that much money.

228
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:19,825
Christine is decent.

229
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,890
The guy's weird, Arnie.

230
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:24,027
He's fucking weird.

231
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:27,767
- So that was 300?
- Yeah, that's it.

232
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,741
- You said 250.
- 250 would do it.

233
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:34,976
It this is a good idea,
let's just come back tomorrow.

234
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,778
Do you realize
she's 20 years old?

235
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:40,412
I mean, that makes her
officially an antique.

236
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:44,949
Great. Darnell's junkyard
is full of official antiques.

237
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:48,223
I'm buying her.
I don't care what you say.

238
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:50,265
It's your funeral, man.

239
00:19:56,806 --> 00:20:00,241
Would you give
Arnie a break?

240
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,301
He doesn't know what he's doing.

241
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,307
You don't know half as much
as you think you do...

242
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,147
shitter.

243
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,653
You did what?

244
00:20:12,723 --> 00:20:16,421
- She's outside.
- You're kidding, right?

245
00:20:16,494 --> 00:20:20,192
You can't buy a car.
What are you talking about?

246
00:20:20,265 --> 00:20:23,723
- You're 17 years old.
- Oh, boy.

247
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:25,566
Actually, you're wrong.

248
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:29,596
I couldn't finance it,
but buying it for cash is no problem.

249
00:20:29,676 --> 00:20:33,009
Registering a car at 17
is something else...

250
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:35,412
and for that
I need your permission.

251
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:37,712
You know how we do things.

252
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:40,451
You could've consulted with us.

253
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:45,550
I've consulted with you
about every damn thing I've ever done.

254
00:20:45,627 --> 00:20:49,621
If it's something I want,
I get outvoted, two to one!

255
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:52,166
This is no committee meeting.
I bought the car, and that's it!

256
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:56,364
It most certainly
is not it!

257
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:59,807
How could you have
let him do this?

258
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:03,606
I didn't let him.
He wanted the car, and he bought it.

259
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:07,311
I tried to talk him out ot it.

260
00:21:07,384 --> 00:21:10,912
I doubt you tried very hard.

261
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:14,755
- Yeah, well, I'm going home.
- I think you should.

262
00:21:14,826 --> 00:21:16,759
That's it. I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

263
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:20,355
- What kind of lang--
- What did you say!

264
00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:26,396
You wanted me in college courses.
I'm there.

265
00:21:26,472 --> 00:21:29,442
You wanted chess club instead of band.
I'm there too.

266
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:33,740
I've managed 17 years without
embarrassing you or landing in jail.

267
00:21:33,813 --> 00:21:36,713
I'm gonna have this one thing!

268
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:41,949
You are not keeping
any car at this house.

269
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:43,579
Fine!

270
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,259
Thanks for the milk.

271
00:22:32,677 --> 00:22:36,273
- What's the problem?
- Could you honk your horn for me?

272
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:38,839
Christine's doesn't
seem to work.

273
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,853
- Ah. Sure,
- Thanks.

274
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:16,259
Stall 20.

275
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:20,790
Get it over there
and shut it off...

276
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:23,163
before we all
choke to death.

277
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,230
Kiddo, if you sold him that piece of
shit, you ought to be fuckin' ashamed.

278
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:33,335
I didn't sell it to him.
I tried to talk him out of it.

279
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,573
You should have tried harder.

280
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:52,930
I knew a guy who had
a car like that once.

281
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,867
Fuckin' bastard
killed himself in it.

282
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,871
Son of a bitch was so mean...

283
00:23:57,939 --> 00:24:00,101
if you poured boiling water
down his throat...

284
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:03,404
he would have pissed ice cubes.

285
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:07,244
Okay.
That's the last time...

286
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:10,580
you run that mechanical asshole
in here without an exhaust hose.

287
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:13,486
I catch you doin' it one time,
and you're out. You understand?

288
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:17,018
- Huh?
- Yes.

289
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:19,561
I'm gonna tell you
something else right now.

290
00:24:20,497 --> 00:24:23,625
I don't take any shit
from you kids.

291
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:27,898
This place is for working stiffs,
gotta keep their cars runnin'.

292
00:24:27,971 --> 00:24:31,374
It's not for rich-assed, snot-nosed kids
draggin' on the Orange Belt.

293
00:24:31,442 --> 00:24:35,573
I don't allow no smoking in here
neither. You go out in the junkyard.

294
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:39,173
- I don't smoke.
- Don't interrupt me, punk.

295
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,118
Don't interrupt me.
Don't get smart.

296
00:24:43,556 --> 00:24:45,523
- Ah, sir?
- What?

297
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:51,395
Those men over there are smoking.
Better tell them to stop.

298
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:56,228
You trying to help your buddy
right out of here, Chuck?

299
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,473
Then shut your pie hole.

300
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,515
I know a creep when I see one.

301
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,346
I think I'm looking
at one right now.

302
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:17,218
You're on probation.
You get it?

303
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:19,090
You screw around with me...

304
00:25:19,162 --> 00:25:21,221
I don't care how much money
you paid up in front...

305
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:25,325
I'll throw you out
on your ass! You got it?

306
00:25:25,402 --> 00:25:28,337
- Huh?
- Yes, sir.

307
00:25:28,405 --> 00:25:30,031
Good.

308
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:35,945
Now get the hell out of here.
We're closed.

309
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:56,167
You gonna be okay?

310
00:25:58,705 --> 00:26:00,640
Yeah. I'm okay.

311
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:10,480
You know, you better find yourself some
other charity besides me and Christine.

312
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:14,944
What is it about that car?

313
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:20,228
I don't know.

314
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,968
Maybe it's just that for the first time
I've found something uglier than me.

315
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:29,996
And I know I can fix her up.

316
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:32,008
You're not ugly, Arnie.

317
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:36,078
I know what I am,

318
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:39,750
Queer, maybe, but not ugly.

319
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:42,609
Fuck you.

320
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:52,926
Oh, bug out, Dennis.
You don't need this shit.

321
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:05,137
Where have you been?
You had us worried sick!

322
00:27:05,211 --> 00:27:07,942
You don't just up and drive off
whenever you--

323
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:24,092
<i>♪ As I walk along I wonder ♪<i/>

324
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:28,900
<i>♪ What went wrong
with our love ♪<i/>

325
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:31,805
<i>♪ A love that
was so strong ♪<i/>

326
00:27:46,223 --> 00:27:50,023
He's done all this shit
in three weeks.

327
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:53,394
Look how cockeyed he works.

328
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:56,799
He's got fuckin' brand-new
windshield wipers...

329
00:27:56,869 --> 00:27:59,098
for a busted windshield.

330
00:28:01,107 --> 00:28:03,372
Well, the boy does
have good hands.

331
00:28:03,442 --> 00:28:04,875
Good hands.

332
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,005
Bad taste in cars.

333
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:14,319
You know, Papa,
you can't polish a turd.

334
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:45,518
When I said you could scrounge through
that shit pile out back...

335
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:50,528
I didn't mean you could build
your whole fuckin' car with my stuff.

336
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:54,055
What do you care?
You're not doing anything with it.

337
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:58,000
Hey! Don't think you
got the gold key to the crapper.

338
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,436
Nobody takes advantage
of me, understand?

339
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,507
Yeah.

340
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:08,240
If it wasn't for me, it'd cost you
a shit pile to put this heap together.

341
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:09,748
I know.

342
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,023
Look.

343
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:22,726
I know you ain't got money
falling out of your asshole.

344
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:25,231
If you did,
you wouldn't be here.

345
00:29:27,603 --> 00:29:30,903
Maybe we could work out
some kind of a deal.

346
00:29:36,747 --> 00:29:39,113
You...

347
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:41,615
pick up around the place.

348
00:29:41,684 --> 00:29:43,619
Do a few lubes...

349
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,751
put the toilet paper
on the little spools...

350
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:50,088
shit like that.

351
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:52,288
Do that and you can--

352
00:29:52,364 --> 00:29:56,993
you can raid my junk pile
for whatever you want.

353
00:29:57,068 --> 00:30:00,299
I might even throw in
a few bucks.

354
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,809
I'll have to think about it.

355
00:30:04,877 --> 00:30:08,836
Well, don't think about it too long!
I'll throw you out on your fuckin' ass.

366
00:31:19,426 --> 00:31:21,361
Just 'cause she shot you down?

367
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:24,192
She says no to everybody.

368
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:34,633
Look what she's doing
to that pencil.

369
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,440
I wish I was an eraser.

370
00:31:40,717 --> 00:31:43,184
Go on, studley.
Ask her out.

371
00:31:43,252 --> 00:31:45,618
Mind your own business.
Just read the book.

372
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:49,557
Yeah. Come on.
Just don't tip the table over.

373
00:32:49,526 --> 00:32:51,461
What are you reading?

374
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:55,521
- History.
- Oh.

375
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,730
- It's pretty boring, huh?
- Yeah.

376
00:32:59,804 --> 00:33:01,567
Listen, do you like music?

377
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,638
What about dancing?

378
00:33:07,712 --> 00:33:09,374
Yes.

379
00:33:10,182 --> 00:33:12,980
Do you think you might...

380
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,451
want to go dancing with me...

381
00:33:15,521 --> 00:33:18,923
like maybe this Friday night
after the game?

382
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,651
I'm sorry. I can't.

383
00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:34,939
Why not?

384
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:39,045
I have a date.

385
00:33:39,114 --> 00:33:42,881
Mr. Gilder! Are you lost?

386
00:33:44,818 --> 00:33:46,412
No, ma'am.

387
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:49,424
Why don't you return to your own seat
and get back to work.

388
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:52,192
Yeah.

389
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:18,085
Arnie, stay here
so we can talk this over.

390
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:21,753
Mister, this is not a hotel
you can just drop into.

391
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,818
- I don't need this.
- What do you need?

392
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:28,094
- I need to leave. I'm late.
- You come back here this instant.

393
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,498
Oh, shit.

394
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:35,041
Greetings to you too.

395
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:40,876
Hey, man, no glasses.
You're lookin' good.

396
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:44,009
I can't make it.
I meant to call you, but I forgot.

397
00:34:46,855 --> 00:34:49,416
Is Dennis going with you?

398
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:53,018
- Are you going with him?
- Am I?

399
00:34:53,096 --> 00:34:56,121
No. I've gotta do an errand
for Darnell.

400
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:59,362
- You need a ride?
- Got his car. Thanks, though.

401
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:02,132
I'm sorry about the movie,
but this is work. Gotta go.

402
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,268
- Don't worry about it.
- Did you have plans with Dennis?

403
00:35:08,612 --> 00:35:13,949
You are going to have no friends at all
if you keep treating people this way.

404
00:35:14,018 --> 00:35:15,485
Get off my back!

405
00:35:19,523 --> 00:35:22,460
You're his best friend.
What's going on?

406
00:35:26,931 --> 00:35:29,923
I don't know.
I hardly see him anymore.

407
00:35:31,938 --> 00:35:33,871
Neither do we.

408
00:35:35,976 --> 00:35:40,471
Ever since he bought that car
he's been obsessed with it.

409
00:35:40,547 --> 00:35:43,108
And you know what else?

410
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,516
When we signed the registration papers
at Town Hall...

411
00:35:47,288 --> 00:35:51,452
they told us the man
who owned that car last...

412
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:54,690
died in it
of carbon monoxide poisoning.

413
00:35:57,398 --> 00:36:01,335
Jesus.
Does Arnie know about that?

414
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:06,869
Arnie doesn't know anything anymore.

415
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,717
What the hell do you want?

416
00:36:22,793 --> 00:36:24,762
I know about your brother.

417
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:30,661
I know he died
choking on exhaust fumes.

418
00:36:30,737 --> 00:36:33,331
You don't know shit, kid.

419
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:36,934
My brother died
'cause he wanted to.

420
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,239
He ran a rubber hose
from the exhaust pipe.

421
00:36:39,313 --> 00:36:42,304
Arnie wouldn't have bought it
if he'd known somebody died in it.

422
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:46,485
Either you're dumb or you
don't know your friend very well,

423
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:50,152
He had the same look
my brother always had.

424
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,320
Probably the only thing my brother
ever loved in his life was that car.

425
00:36:56,398 --> 00:37:01,199
No shitter ever came between him
and Christine. If they did, watch out.

426
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,905
His five-year-old daughter choked to
death in it. He wouldn't get rid of it.

427
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:11,005
He rode around without a care
in the world except for Christine.

428
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:15,811
Only time I ever interfered
was when Rita killed herself.

429
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:19,481
- Who's Rita?
- His wife!

430
00:37:19,556 --> 00:37:22,047
He didn't care
a rat's ass about her.

431
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:24,389
She died the same way he did.

432
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:27,329
Then I made him get rid of it.

433
00:37:27,398 --> 00:37:31,061
For decency, you know.

434
00:37:31,135 --> 00:37:33,367
Of course, the car came back
three weeks later.

435
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,429
What do you mean, '' came back? ''

Ready?

442
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,849
Want me to go deep or flat?

443
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,913
Flat. I'll hit you
on the second shot comin' around.

444
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:06,097
Hey, Trelawney.

445
00:40:06,173 --> 00:40:09,576
- Is that Cuntingham's car?
- Yep.

446
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:12,713
I know where he keeps it.

447
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:32,592
Down...

448
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,297
set, go!

449
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,273
Fucking shit!

450
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:20,278

''5,000 Dirty Limericks.''

452
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:26,858
Ought to keep you busy for a while.

453
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:29,864
This is the third time
I've come by.

454
00:42:29,932 --> 00:42:33,800
Must be dynamite drugs.
You're always asleep.

455
00:42:33,871 --> 00:42:35,804
Doesn't quite kill the pain.

456
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:41,574
Rockbridge hasn't won a game
since you got hurt.

457
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:43,443
That makes you a hero, right?

458
00:42:44,548 --> 00:42:49,146
Did I tell you that I'm not gonna
be playing football again? Ever.

459
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:55,150
The doctor said that
one centimeter more...

460
00:42:55,226 --> 00:42:58,286
and I would have been paralyzed
from the waist down.

461
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:02,731
Shitters did some job on you, huh?

462
00:43:05,105 --> 00:43:08,074
So what's this
about you and Leigh Cabot?

463
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:15,347
- We like each other okay.
- Ho-ho. Listen to Mr. Cool.

464
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:18,784
She just happens to be
the most beautiful girl in the school.

465
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:23,347
Well, it's not what you think.
I really...

466
00:43:23,425 --> 00:43:25,485
respect her mind.

467
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,858
She lusts after my body.
What can I say?

468
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:29,364
Fuck you.

469
00:43:32,768 --> 00:43:34,963
I saw you guys at the football game.

470
00:43:37,206 --> 00:43:39,697
How'd you ever get that car
fixed up like that?

471
00:43:39,777 --> 00:43:44,112
Oh, just plain
old-fashioned hard work.

472
00:43:45,782 --> 00:43:47,273
I still can't keep her at home.

473
00:43:47,351 --> 00:43:49,945
Mom says it makes
the yard look crowded.

474
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:53,286
I'm surprised they let you register it.

475
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:55,985
I told them it they didn't,
I'd drop school.

476
00:43:56,061 --> 00:43:58,222
Are you serious?

477
00:44:02,302 --> 00:44:06,739
They just don't want me to grow up
because they'd have to face getting old.

478
00:44:17,085 --> 00:44:20,748
Has it ever occurred to you...

479
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:24,155
that part of being a parent...

480
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:26,420
is trying to kill your kids?

481
00:44:29,597 --> 00:44:31,588
See you around, pal.

482
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:24,882
I'm sorry, Arnie. I can't.

483
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,844
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

484
00:45:51,856 --> 00:45:54,416
I can't. Here.

485
00:45:57,795 --> 00:45:59,728
In that car.

486
00:46:02,034 --> 00:46:03,967
What are you talking about?
Why not?

487
00:46:06,072 --> 00:46:07,766
'Cause I hate that car.

488
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,400
You care more about that car
than me.

489
00:46:15,215 --> 00:46:16,704
That's crazy, Leigh.

490
00:46:16,782 --> 00:46:18,717
Who do you spend
more time with?

491
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:27,056
Look--
You're gonna get a cold. Come on.

492
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:56,956
I thought girls are supposed to
be jealous of other girls, not cars.

493
00:46:58,530 --> 00:46:59,961
This car's a girl.

494
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,588
Oh, please.

495
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:07,768
Cut it out. Don't.

496
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,969
What? You don't like me
slapping your girl?

497
00:47:21,987 --> 00:47:25,184
It seems like nobody
likes my car these days.

498
00:47:47,884 --> 00:47:49,612

00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:40,835
Yeah, I'm fine now.

509
00:49:40,909 --> 00:49:43,275
You scared the hell out of me.

510
00:49:43,344 --> 00:49:45,405
Then get rid of that car.

511
00:49:47,514 --> 00:49:50,005
I'm not going in it again.

512
00:49:50,085 --> 00:49:53,954
Wait a minute. Don't you blame
your choking on Christine.

513
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:55,956
It happened, Arnie.

514
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:59,722
When I choked, something happened.
The radio came on.

515
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:04,096
- Everything got bright.
- So, what are you saying?

516
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:08,135
I could've died,
and you couldn't even help.

517
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:10,231
My door was locked.

518
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,275
You didn't want that man
to help me either!

519
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,905
I thought he was attacking you!
I could have done the Heimlich maneuver.

520
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,447
But you didn't.

521
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:22,646
There are other things.
That radio.

522
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:26,054
All it gets is those old songs.

523
00:50:26,126 --> 00:50:28,184
Sometimes when we're making out...

524
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,389
it just stalls.

525
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:33,398
As if the car
were jealous, Arnie.

526
00:50:34,768 --> 00:50:36,793
A goddamn car!

527
00:50:40,173 --> 00:50:41,731
I'Il get it.

528
00:50:42,777 --> 00:50:44,768
Know what I think?

529
00:50:44,844 --> 00:50:47,713
I think you're just
sexually frustrated.

530
00:50:57,893 --> 00:50:59,690
I'm sorry, okay?

531
00:51:01,697 --> 00:51:04,326
Can I at least call you tomorrow?

00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:14,876
I don't know.

You know, I've been thinking.

Maybe we should apply
to the same colleges next year.

549
00:55:53,552 --> 00:55:55,612
- Really?
- Yeah.

550
00:55:55,688 --> 00:55:57,782
If we get accepted
by the same schools...

551
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:02,295
we could take it as a sign of fate.

552
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:05,594
You'd have me to help you

553
00:56:08,268 --> 00:56:11,329
Arnie, what's wrong?

554
00:57:04,097 --> 00:57:06,032
Who did this?

555
00:57:25,353 --> 00:57:28,518
Don't touch me, shitter!
This is just what you wanted!

556
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:30,753
You get away from her!

557
00:57:34,498 --> 00:57:36,431
Arnie, I'm sorry.

558
00:57:39,036 --> 00:57:40,663
Sorry?

559
00:57:40,737 --> 00:57:42,170
Yes.

560
00:57:43,407 --> 00:57:47,036
I--
That is, we--

561
00:57:47,112 --> 00:57:48,806
It's your fault.

562
00:57:50,414 --> 00:57:54,784
If you hadn't been so damn selfish that
you wouldn't let me park my own car...

563
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:57,184
in your precious driveway,
this never would have happened.

564
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,782
That's not fair.

565
00:57:59,858 --> 00:58:02,157
Oh, it's fair.

566
00:58:04,164 --> 00:58:07,293
Can't we even talk about this...

567
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:09,302
like rational human beings?

568
00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:12,065
One of them took a shit
on the dashboard of my car, Ma.

569
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:14,471
How's that for rational, huh?

570
00:58:18,213 --> 00:58:20,077
Why don't we--

571
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:25,443
Your mother and I have decided
to help you buy a new car.

573
00:58:34,898 --> 00:58:36,559
Well, fuck you.

574
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:40,228
I'm fixing up Christine.

575
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:51,106
Listen, mister, you've been
disrespectful to us once too often!

576
00:58:51,181 --> 00:58:53,583
You apologize to your mother
right now!

577
00:58:53,652 --> 00:58:55,916

Oh, cherry.

598
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:49,974
I spent a shitload of money on her,
and she's perfecto now.

599
01:06:52,414 --> 01:06:54,608
That's funny, you know, 'cause...

600
01:06:54,682 --> 01:06:56,617
I heard she was totaled.

601
01:06:57,853 --> 01:07:01,550
After I cleaned up the broken glass,
it wasn't so bad.

602
01:07:06,228 --> 01:07:08,164
I bet you a hundred bucks...

603
01:07:09,565 --> 01:07:11,556
it was Buddy Repperton.

604
01:07:12,902 --> 01:07:14,335
Maybe.

605
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:19,639
So what if you fix it up and he
just comes back and does it again?

606
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:21,735
He won't do it again.

607
01:07:24,215 --> 01:07:25,978
What does that mean?

608
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:28,483
Man, I gotta go.

609
01:07:28,554 --> 01:07:32,251
I hope you didn't think
I could hang around here all day.

610
01:07:32,324 --> 01:07:34,985
Yeah, that's you, Arnie,
always in demand.

611
01:07:36,695 --> 01:07:38,128
Stay loose.

612
01:07:41,001 --> 01:07:42,592
You know it.

613
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:47,297

615
01:08:06,228 --> 01:08:07,661
They let you out early?

616
01:08:09,398 --> 01:08:10,889
Yeah, that's right.

617
01:08:13,402 --> 01:08:16,565
I'm Rudolph Junkins,
State Police, Detective.

618
01:08:16,639 --> 01:08:19,472
I'm just missing a study hall.
I got to get to work.

619
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:22,376
I don't care about that.
I want to ask you about your car.

620
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:27,009
You do nice body work.
I thought this thing was totaled.

621
01:08:28,185 --> 01:08:30,654
- Who told you that?
- Why, hell, everybody.

622
01:08:30,722 --> 01:08:34,283
Local police, your mom and dad,
your girl. Cute girl, by the way.

623
01:08:35,827 --> 01:08:38,159
It wasn't as bad as it looked.

624
01:08:40,734 --> 01:08:43,667
The report said
they punched holes in the body.

625
01:08:43,737 --> 01:08:45,670
Damned if I can see the fill.

626
01:08:45,738 --> 01:08:47,934
You can if you look.

627
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:50,568
It's right over there...

628
01:08:50,645 --> 01:08:52,805
and back here.

629
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,509
I've been lucky with parts.
I replaced the entire door on this side.

630
01:08:56,582 --> 01:08:59,347
- Yeah?
- See where the paint doesn't match?

631
01:09:01,421 --> 01:09:05,791
Nope. A hell of a job, Arnie.

632
01:09:05,859 --> 01:09:07,623
Well, thank you very much.

633
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,390
So what do you want?

634
01:09:36,461 --> 01:09:40,363
I really like this shade of red.
Didn't think they made this anymore.

635
01:09:40,431 --> 01:09:42,627
Do they still make this shade?

636
01:09:42,702 --> 01:09:45,500
Well, they must.
I bought it, didn't I?

637
01:09:45,572 --> 01:09:49,132
- Where?
- Baker Auto out on Route 5.

638
01:09:50,243 --> 01:09:53,610
- You still got the receipt?
- Tossed it out.

639
01:09:57,417 --> 01:10:00,717
You know, it's funny--
Cigarette?

640
01:10:00,788 --> 01:10:02,449
No, thanks.

641
01:10:02,524 --> 01:10:05,686
Usually when somebody trashes a car,
we get photographs.

642
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,059
Wait. They didn't really trash it.

643
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:11,257
That's not what Leigh said.

644
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:14,530
She was so shaken up,
giving me all the details...

645
01:10:14,604 --> 01:10:16,265
she broke down crying.

646
01:10:16,338 --> 01:10:18,306
I understand...

647
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:24,073
one of the perpetrators
defecated on the dashboard.

648
01:10:24,146 --> 01:10:26,877
I would've thought you'd
be madder than hell at that...

649
01:10:26,949 --> 01:10:29,818
and I would've thought
you would've reported that.

650
01:10:30,686 --> 01:10:32,814
Shit wipes off.

651
01:10:34,123 --> 01:10:37,060
Moochie Welch
kind of got wiped off too.

652
01:10:39,297 --> 01:10:40,730
I don't know.

653
01:10:40,797 --> 01:10:43,926
- You don't know?
- No.

654
01:10:44,002 --> 01:10:45,527
Scout's honor?

655
01:10:46,438 --> 01:10:48,372
I'm not a Scout.

656
01:10:49,842 --> 01:10:53,573
The kid was cut in half. They had
to scrape his legs up with a shovel.

657
01:10:53,646 --> 01:10:56,582
Isn't that what you're supposed
to do with shit...

658
01:10:56,649 --> 01:10:58,845
scrape it up with a shovel?

659
01:11:00,488 --> 01:11:02,512
Don't get smart with me, son.

660
01:11:03,957 --> 01:11:06,792
Your girlfriend is
more convincing than you are.

661
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:16,061
She's not my girlfriend.

662
01:11:16,139 --> 01:11:19,506
And since when is it against the law
to fix your own car...

663
01:11:19,574 --> 01:11:21,872
when somebody else busts it up?

664
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,740
Since never.

665
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:26,747
Then you get off my back.

666
01:11:47,273 --> 01:11:50,673
I need to see you.

667
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:55,011
I care about you.

668
01:11:59,453 --> 01:12:01,113
Look, I love you.

669
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:05,818
I think we deserve one more try.

670
01:12:07,095 --> 01:12:09,654
Don't you?

671
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:12,198
Would you give me a yes or no!

672
01:12:12,265 --> 01:12:15,202
Please don't do this to me.

673
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:18,238
Just be straight with me.
You've had it, right?

674
01:12:18,306 --> 01:12:20,002
Well, fuck you, bitch!

675
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:07,893
Want to do the honors?

676
01:13:10,296 --> 01:13:12,230
I'd love to bring her along.

677
01:13:12,298 --> 01:13:13,891
Sure.

678
01:13:13,967 --> 01:13:16,458
- She can earn her way.
- Bullshit.

679
01:13:16,537 --> 01:13:18,335

01:13:20,307 --> 01:13:21,899

Let's give this asshole
some of his own medicine.

689
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:41,494
He's backing up too.

690
01:15:17,104 --> 01:15:19,731
Some shithead's following me!

691
01:15:21,108 --> 01:15:22,972
I hope he comes in here!

692
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:54,507
- Is that Cunningham?
- It can't be.

693
01:15:56,113 --> 01:15:58,082
Look at my car.

694
01:15:58,149 --> 01:16:00,981

697
01:19:19,604 --> 01:19:21,766
Listen. Cunningham get there?

698
01:19:23,074 --> 01:19:25,010

699
01:19:25,078 --> 01:19:26,703
Good.

700
01:19:26,779 --> 01:19:29,715
Listen. He was driving
my Caddy, wasn't he?

701
01:19:31,283 --> 01:19:33,877
Good. Yes. Take it easy.

702
01:20:05,421 --> 01:20:09,358
Okay, Jack. Come on out.

703
01:20:11,429 --> 01:20:13,225
The ride is over.

704
01:20:16,734 --> 01:20:20,694

705
01:20:20,771 --> 01:20:22,466
I'm gonna get ya.

01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:41,386

- Where were you last night?
- Home.

719
01:23:11,493 --> 01:23:14,054
- What are you doing to my car?
- You didn't go out at all?

720
01:23:14,965 --> 01:23:19,298
Of course I went out. I got Darnell's
car out front with a load of parts.

721
01:23:19,368 --> 01:23:21,529
- You want the receipt?
- Yeah.

722
01:23:31,216 --> 01:23:33,707
How come you're showing up just now?

723
01:23:33,786 --> 01:23:36,448
Why didn't you unload
the stuff last night?

724
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:38,489
Because I was tired, that's why.

725
01:23:40,658 --> 01:23:43,628
If you don't believe me,
you can ask my mother.

726
01:23:43,697 --> 01:23:46,631
Why do you keep
butting into my life?

727
01:23:46,699 --> 01:23:51,159
Because we found your boss,
Will Darnell, dead in your front seat...

728
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:53,365
with a shotgun by his side.

729
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:13,390
- Why?
- I was hoping you could answer that.

730
01:24:13,462 --> 01:24:16,659
Somebody saw your car cruising
behind Buddy Repperton last night.

731
01:24:16,733 --> 01:24:19,030
He's dead too.

732
01:24:19,101 --> 01:24:22,367
So are Don Vandenberg
and Richard Trelawney.

733
01:24:23,706 --> 01:24:25,902
Guess nobody'll be trashing
your car anymore.

734
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,976
Well, all I know--

735
01:24:34,552 --> 01:24:36,315
I got a Cadillac full of parts...

736
01:24:36,387 --> 01:24:38,480
and I'm supposed to be
at school in half an hour.

737
01:24:38,556 --> 01:24:41,822
We'll take care of the Caddy.
I don't want you touching it.

738
01:24:47,766 --> 01:24:52,363
Honest, I don't know what's going on.
I swear I don't.

739
01:24:57,712 --> 01:24:59,645
May I please speak to Dennis?

740
01:25:00,981 --> 01:25:02,972
It's a girl.

741
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:08,711
Happy New Year.

742
01:25:09,657 --> 01:25:12,649
Can I come over there?
I need to talk to you.

743
01:25:13,862 --> 01:25:16,591
- What, about Arnie?
- About Christine.

744
01:25:21,302 --> 01:25:22,998
You first.

745
01:25:25,743 --> 01:25:27,573
I'm afraid for Arnie.

746
01:25:29,113 --> 01:25:31,274
I thought you wanted to talk
about Christine.

747
01:25:31,349 --> 01:25:34,011
What do you know about that car?

748
01:25:35,519 --> 01:25:38,283
I know that the guy
who owned the car before Arnie--

749
01:25:38,356 --> 01:25:39,846
Yeah?

750
01:25:39,925 --> 01:25:42,621
His daughter choked to death
in Christine.

751
01:25:42,694 --> 01:25:45,287
How do you know that?

752
01:25:45,363 --> 01:25:48,457
LeBay's brother sold Arnie the car,
and the guy's a jerk.

753
01:25:48,533 --> 01:25:52,833
- He just came out and told me.
- I think I was supposed to be next.

754
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:57,509
Come on.

755
01:26:00,046 --> 01:26:01,980
Arnie would never do that.

756
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:05,609
Not in a million years.

757
01:26:09,355 --> 01:26:11,551
I don't think he's Arnie.

758
01:26:15,029 --> 01:26:18,591
It's that car.
I swear it's the car.

759
01:26:19,335 --> 01:26:20,666
Maybe.

760
01:26:22,003 --> 01:26:24,439
I'm going to Arnie's tonight
for New Year's--

761
01:26:24,507 --> 01:26:27,601
- I wouldn't.
- It's okay.

762
01:26:27,677 --> 01:26:31,078
We do it every year.
His folks are going to be there.

763
01:26:31,148 --> 01:26:34,515
Maybe if I get him alone,
maybe he'll talk to me.

764
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:36,016
What if he doesn't?

765
01:26:37,421 --> 01:26:41,119
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

766
01:26:41,193 --> 01:26:43,559
What if that car doesn't let him?

767
01:26:47,466 --> 01:26:49,592
Then we destroy it.

780

787
01:29:04,317 --> 01:29:06,181

of the world in 1979.

790
01:29:12,257 --> 01:29:14,524

I can't drink to that.

791
01:29:15,828 --> 01:29:17,922

792
01:29:17,997 --> 01:29:21,024
What about to us?
You know, to friendship?

793
01:29:21,101 --> 01:29:25,162
Oh, friendship. Right.
That's real good.

794
01:29:47,396 --> 01:29:48,729

795
01:29:48,798 --> 01:29:51,164
I want you to see this.

796
01:29:51,234 --> 01:29:55,069
This is great alignment.
You just don't see this anymore.

797
01:30:02,015 --> 01:30:03,676

798
01:30:06,019 --> 01:30:08,680
I'm scared for you,

01:30:08,755 --> 01:30:10,346
It's this fucking car.

800
01:30:11,591 --> 01:30:13,149
I know you're jealous.

801
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:18,993
We'll always be friends,
as long as you stick with me.

802
01:30:19,065 --> 01:30:22,399
You know what happens
to shitters who don't.

803
01:30:22,469 --> 01:30:24,733
No. What does happen?

804
01:30:25,673 --> 01:30:28,234
Let's not kid each other.

805
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:30,734

806
01:30:32,546 --> 01:30:34,606
All of 'em.

807
01:30:39,689 --> 01:30:42,213
Leigh's on your side.

808
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:45,283
- Oh, yeah?
- She cares a lot about you.

809
01:30:48,533 --> 01:30:50,625
She does.

810
01:30:50,702 --> 01:30:51,962
Yeah.

811
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:56,034
Don't you like this beer?
I thought you liked beer.

812
01:30:56,106 --> 01:30:58,041
Did you hear what I just said?

813
01:30:59,143 --> 01:31:02,135
Let me tell you
a little something about love.

814
01:31:02,212 --> 01:31:04,978
It has a voracious appetite.

815
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:09,850
It eats everything--
friendship, family.

816
01:31:09,921 --> 01:31:12,515
It kills me, how much it eats.

817
01:31:12,591 --> 01:31:14,354
I'll tell you something else.

818
01:31:14,426 --> 01:31:16,690
Feed it right,
and it can be a beautiful thing...

819
01:31:16,762 --> 01:31:19,527
and that's what we have.

820
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:23,434
When someone believes in you, you can do
any fucking thing in the universe...

821
01:31:23,502 --> 01:31:25,938
and when you believe right back
in that someone...

822
01:31:26,006 --> 01:31:29,238
then watch out, world,
'cause nobody can stop you ever!

823
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,841
You feel this way about Leigh?

824
01:31:37,418 --> 01:31:41,445
What? Fuck, no!
I'm talkin' about Christine, man.

825
01:31:41,523 --> 01:31:43,923
No shitter ever came
between me and Christine.

826
01:31:45,528 --> 01:31:47,018
Watch this.

827
01:31:51,266 --> 01:31:52,895
Oh, shit.

828
01:32:00,377 --> 01:32:02,173
Chicken shit!

829
01:32:04,783 --> 01:32:09,413
Man, there is nothin' finer than being
behind the wheel of your own car...

830
01:32:10,655 --> 01:32:12,590
except maybe for pussy.

831
01:33:46,828 --> 01:33:48,762
It's kinda spooky in here, huh?

832
01:33:50,733 --> 01:33:53,759
Looks like they cleaned out
the whole place.

833
01:33:53,836 --> 01:33:55,600
Jesus.

834
01:33:58,274 --> 01:34:01,608
That's where he used to keep it.
Down there.

835
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:03,770
Yeah.

836
01:34:06,449 --> 01:34:08,041
You better get started,

837
01:34:30,143 --> 01:34:31,905
Yeah!

838
01:34:31,978 --> 01:34:33,742
What do you think?

839
01:34:35,548 --> 01:34:38,073
Let's try it.

840
01:35:26,738 --> 01:35:28,832
Christine's gonna come
through the door.

841
01:35:31,344 --> 01:35:34,039
You better get in the office
and stay out of sight.

842
01:35:34,113 --> 01:35:38,050
Once she gets inside, hit the button
and bring the door down.

843
01:35:39,118 --> 01:35:41,020
Then we'll have her trapped.

844
01:35:41,087 --> 01:35:43,021
What if he doesn't come?

845
01:35:44,391 --> 01:35:46,292
Christine will.

846
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:15,850
You better get in the office.
