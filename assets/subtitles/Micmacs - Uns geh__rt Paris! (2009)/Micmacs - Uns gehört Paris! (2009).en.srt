1
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,000
Hello?

2
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,082
Good morning, is your mother in?

3
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:57,211
Are your ready?

4
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:02,925
I need to go now.

5
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:15,062
Jesus, the son of God...

6
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:19,024
...descended to earth and suffered...

7
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:21,818
...to pay for our sins.

8
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,849
THIRTY YEARS LATER

9
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:54,351
<i>You're in danger.</i>

10
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:57,562
<i>I don't care
as long as I'm near you.</i>

11
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,692
<i>I never thanked you for your help.</i>

12
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:04,111
<i>It was brave, very courageous.</i>

13
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:06,655
<i>I've never seen anybody so beautiful.</i>

14
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,574
<i>I think I'm in love with you.</i>

15
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:14,955
<i>- You'll come with me to the police?
- No.</i>

16
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:16,248
<i>Why?</i>

17
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:20,001
<i>I killed Charles Ringan.</i>

18
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,295
<i>Would you tell the Commissioner?</i>

19
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,006
<i>If you insist.</i>

20
00:04:27,217 --> 00:04:28,719
<i>I don't want to.</i>

21
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,431
<i>Listen, I'm very tired, I feel stiff.</i>

22
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:37,102
<i>I killed a man and I witnessed
the murder of a poor soul.</i>

23
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:40,856
<i>It's all because Geiger was singing Carmen.</i>

24
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:44,985
<i>If I told, your house would
be invaded by police...</i>

25
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:47,904
<i>...before you'd have time to flee.</i>

26
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:22,689
<i>Perhaps she'll recover.
I've seen it in the past.</i>

27
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:26,735
<i>We'll let your father know about Ringan.</i>

28
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:28,862
<i>You forgot something.</i>

29
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,072
<i>Me?</i>

30
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:33,992
<i>What do you have?</i>

31
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:37,162
<i>Nothing you can't heal.</i>

32
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:55,347
OH!

33
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:20,997
"The Slide Whistle Micmacs"

34
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,346
If I extract the bullet,
he may become a vegetable.

35
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,308
If I don't extract it,
he'll be living on a knife edge.

36
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,353
Better to be alive and at risk of dying...

37
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,356
...than to live without being
conscious of living.

38
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,276
This is closer to philosophy then medicine.

39
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:33,445
Heads or Tails?

40
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:37,615
Heads!

41
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:41,870
OK, I'll leave it be.
It will set off airport alarms!

42
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:04,350
They changed the lock.

43
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:08,021
What happened,
did you comb your hair with a can opener?

44
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:09,898
Where are my belongings?

45
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,317
Initially, in the cellar.
But you know people...

46
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:16,946
After 3 days, there was
little more than odd socks left.

47
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,747
That's my cap

48
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:30,376
Hey...

49
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:56,819
My little Bazil...

50
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:59,322
For you,
they fell off the back of a truck.

51
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:00,990
100% cotton.

52
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,786
You've a job, you'll find a new home.

53
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,502
Good morning.
Is Serge in?

54
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:15,755
Well! If it isn't Bazil!
You've come back!

55
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,382
I almost didn't.

56
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:20,551
I hope they took the lead
from your head.

57
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:23,137
I'm back, faithful to the position.

58
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,099
But the position was not faithful to you.

59
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,558
I had to replace you.

60
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,104
This is Lola.

61
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:32,897
Three month trial.

62
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:36,150
We just signed a permanent contract.
Ah...

63
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,195
Well, we haven't kissed...

64
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:50,039
Mr Bazil!

65
00:09:50,331 --> 00:09:52,959
Don't listen to him.
In fact, I have a boyfriend.

66
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,711
His name's Ricardo.

67
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:58,881
He picks me up every night on his motorbike.

68
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:00,508
He always parks over there.

69
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,219
Where you were shot.

70
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,887
One day, while riding...

71
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:10,476
We heard a little noise,
like a pebble stuck in the tyre.

72
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:15,189
Mr Bazil, it was no pebble.

73
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,192
Which hand?

74
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,905
Try again.

75
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:36,753
<i>She puts her head under her feet
and her toes in her nose</i>

76
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:40,173
<i>And then does the splits</i>

77
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:43,843
<i>She spins and
coils like a caterpillar</i>

78
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:46,888
<i>Suddenly, her legs around his neck</i>

79
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,809
<i>She spins, like ball
And nibbles his knees</i>

80
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:55,229
<i>The rubber woman</i>

81
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,691
<i>With her, what fun they can have
Ah, it's crazy</i>

82
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:02,195
<i>It's enough
to make you go funny in the head</i>

83
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:06,157
<i>They search below
And they find it underneath</i>

84
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:09,660
<i>The rubber woman</i>

85
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,704
Thank you...

86
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,308
You got five minutes?

87
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,272
I spent my life in jail.

88
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:45,274
So they call me "Closet".

89
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:47,026
Mine's Bazil.

90
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:49,195
I know.
You're a sweet in jar.

91
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:54,158
You've been on the streets for 2 months,

92
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,369
but you're not beaten, you have a purpose.
What is it?

93
00:13:58,245 --> 00:13:59,497
I live day to day.

94
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:02,958
With the bullet,
that can make me trip out anytime.

95
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:06,587
Me, the widow maker gave me
this injury.

96
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,215
The guillotine in 59.

97
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:13,260
The guillotine jammed.

98
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,596
It happened 2 times.
I was pardoned.

99
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,807
Get that bullet out of your head.

100
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:21,602
Impossible.
The surgeon said...

101
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:22,895
Because...

102
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:26,899
You follow me.
A family will adopt you.

103
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,590
Hi.

104
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:53,092
Hi!

105
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,719
That's Max.
Here we're home.

106
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:59,431
We share our home.
This is our little goose of the Capitol.

107
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:01,642
If the robber is pointing...

108
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,315
Ha! Ha!
Go, go, my little guy.

109
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:29,420
Come on in, don't be shy.

110
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,395
Wakey...

111
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,022
Come, let me introduce you.

112
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:52,109
She decides who is recruited.

113
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:55,362
You collect stray bullets?
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,739
Say!

115
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:58,782
I'm Tambouille.

116
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:02,244
Here stuff is recovered,
we sort it and repair it.

117
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:04,288
Everybody together.

118
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,040
Even little Pierre.

119
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:09,626
And he's an artist.

120
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:20,679
He brings anything we can use.

121
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:01,428
59...

122
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,971
42...

123
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,932
104!

124
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:08,852
Nickel.

125
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:12,523
She's called "Calculator".
Father and mother unknown.

126
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:15,067
He has a compass in his eye.

127
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,195
The white man
a compass in the eye

128
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:21,573
...starvation,
begins at the top...

129
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:23,951
...and goes from cock to the ass.
Yes!

130
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,120
"The compass in the eye".
Note.

131
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:28,914
He was a writer in Brazil.

132
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:31,166
Fracasse is my name.

133
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,876
I have carbon staples...

134
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,545
...in my throat.

135
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:38,674
He lost a lung in a
water bottle explosion

136
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:42,511
...and also have a bicycle Dynamo
in my stomach

137
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:45,097
...and 3 neck joints
of titanium.

138
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:49,184
Well, go ahead, tap away.
Go ahead, it's titanium!

139
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:50,394
Go!
Go ahead!

140
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,187
Oh!

141
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:55,107
He dreams of getting his name
in the Guinness Book of Records.

142
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:59,027
I already did. in 77!
212 metres: Record for the human-cannonball.

143
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,363
We never saw
the certificate.

144
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:03,740
I was robbed!
I've told you already.

145
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:07,619
Hey, you!
Why do you get him upset?

146
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:20,757
Now that you belong to our
family...

147
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:25,554
...get me a small pot of cream
from the fridge.

148
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:40,444
Further down, boy!

149
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:43,989
Aaaahh!

150
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:52,539
You want my picture?

151
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,833
She's a little snappish...

152
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:59,046
...but she's always the first
to bend for others...

153
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,841
You're a contortionist?
No, I am the vegetable crisper!

154
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,676
She was like that from birth...

155
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:08,639
At 5, she was already hiding
in the pantry.

156
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,350
And he remained so long
in the closet...

157
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:15,395
...without laces in his shoes
that he's forgot how to tie them!

158
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:19,107
Come!

159
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:21,902
Go to the table, the mash is ready.

160
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,877
*Speaking a Flemish dialect*

161
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,867
Can I help you?

162
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,204
Yes, I would like to see Mr. De Fenouillet.

163
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:21,247
Of course,
you have an appointment?

164
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,209
That is to say,
I have something in mind.

165
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:25,710
It concerns him.

166
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:29,464
If this is a project or idea,
send an email.

167
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:34,094
I could send him a scan,
but I prefer to see him.

168
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,054
You'll have to leave.

169
00:22:36,346 --> 00:22:37,305
Yes. Warning!

170
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:38,348
Warning!

171
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,767
Warning! Warning!

172
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:51,903
Boo!

173
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:54,989
Show this clown to the street, that's all.

174
00:22:56,032 --> 00:22:57,700
A bullet in the head?

175
00:22:57,992 --> 00:23:00,328
At least he'll remember us!

176
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:30,150
Guys, I need someone here!
Go!

177
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,460
You know we're leaders...

178
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:52,547
...in the field of cluster munitions.

179
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,259
We have quadrupled our sales
in the Gulf...

180
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,555
...decreased by 7 to 9%
on collateral damage.

181
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:04,601
As you know, we're not monsters.

182
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:07,145
We don't want anyone dead.

183
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:09,022
We all know too well...

184
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,859
...that a wounded soldier is more expensive
than a dead soldier!

185
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:17,906
Our CBS-87 fires off
202 projectiles...

186
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:21,201
...and cleans the equivalent
of 4 football fields.

187
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:24,662
We have been present in the Gulf, Kosovo...

188
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:28,875
..and Afghanistan...
In short, it's time to call...

189
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:32,462
...to this forum
the architect of our success.

190
00:24:32,754 --> 00:24:35,548
Our CEO...
Francois Marconi!

191
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:42,180
Thank you, Thank you.
Thank you very much.

192
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:49,562
Tracers...

193
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:52,857
...explosives or bullets...

194
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:55,318
...ours are the best...

195
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,071
...the most aggressive and successful.

196
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:05,328
Rimbaud started out as a poet,
but is now an arms dealer.

197
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,164
Well, I...
I'll do the opposite.

198
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:10,667
But until retirement...

199
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:14,879
..I will continue to rhyme
ambition with ammunition...

200
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:17,340
...Living with dynamite.

201
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:20,760
Long live Vigilante Armament!

202
00:25:39,112 --> 00:25:40,863
Goodnight, Mr. President.

203
00:25:41,864 --> 00:25:43,574
General...

204
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:45,827
Joseph, good night!

205
00:26:27,076 --> 00:26:28,578
May I remind you...

206
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,580
...of the new rule in effect.

207
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:34,542
A landmine was placed
under the playing surface.

208
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:37,170
Yes, it is a renewed challenge...

209
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,921
...offered by the league.

210
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:45,678
The suspense was short lived
as the centre -forward...

211
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,640
...the visiting team
just payed the price.

212
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:03,571
You were brilliant tonight.
Thank you, Georges.

213
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,909
Arthur Rimbaud was an arms dealer,
in history?

214
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:12,079
Yes, but it didn't prevent him from dying
of gangrene, when they amputated his leg.

215
00:27:14,248 --> 00:27:16,000
Baudelaire, of syphilis?

216
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:17,543
Verlaine, delirium tremens...

217
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:19,712
...Lorca was shot...

218
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:22,006
...Nerval hanged himself from a lamppost.

219
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:25,968
I will never encourage my son to
become a poet, sir.

220
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:39,565
Tomorrow,
wake me up at 10am.

221
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:42,026
Yes, sir.

222
00:27:44,695 --> 00:27:47,365
You've worked for us for how long?

223
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:49,825
30 years next month.

224
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:51,410
Ah...

225
00:27:52,286 --> 00:27:53,329
Why don't we...

226
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:56,832
...upgrade this place for your 30 years?

227
00:27:57,124 --> 00:27:59,460
With some hightech equipment.

228
00:28:00,795 --> 00:28:04,423
The old pots make the best soups.

229
00:28:05,132 --> 00:28:06,258
Hum...

230
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:08,135
Change is coming.

231
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,806
At least once every 30 years.

232
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:22,311
Why can't he sleep at the foot of the bed?

233
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,021
Stop moaning!

234
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:26,023
Birds of a Feather.

235
00:30:26,315 --> 00:30:28,359
Hey, Grandma?
Croutons!

236
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,555
The day went well?

237
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:01,267
Yes, papa!
I was brilliant tonight.

238
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:05,354
My Speech was fantastic,
I was compared to Rimbaud.

239
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:06,772
You know who he is?

240
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:08,607
Yes, but your not that muscular.

241
00:31:11,235 --> 00:31:13,737
No, not "Rambo" darling... "Rimbaud".

242
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:18,283
Put him to bed.

243
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:19,660
Yes, Sir.

244
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:46,246
Hello, Yes.

245
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:49,792
No, wait...
How did you get this number?

246
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:51,210
Yes, I see.

247
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:55,339
No, not this kind of transaction,
not over the phone.

248
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:57,633
No! neither...

249
00:32:57,925 --> 00:32:59,676
I prefer a public place.

250
00:32:59,968 --> 00:33:01,803
I know... Say Wednesday...

251
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:04,640
...3pm, the sports department
of Galeries Lafayette.

252
00:33:05,265 --> 00:33:06,391
Yes, that's it.

253
00:33:18,987 --> 00:33:19,947
Waffles...

254
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:21,156
...in Brussels!

255
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:26,578
Don't eat too much, I put rum in the batter.

256
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,121
Hey, stop!

257
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:31,625
*Speaking in Flemish dialect*

258
00:33:38,924 --> 00:33:41,677
*She speaks Chinese*

259
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:48,392
Hurry, the minots!
They'll be ready soon!

260
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:50,102
Mr Fracasse...

261
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:53,772
Isn't this you, here in the
Guinness Book of Records?

262
00:33:54,064 --> 00:33:55,357
Yikes!

263
00:33:56,608 --> 00:33:58,110
The 77!

264
00:34:00,988 --> 00:34:02,656
What did I tell you!

265
00:34:02,948 --> 00:34:05,993
What did I tell you...
Ha! Ha!

266
00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:10,872
"On July 14, 1977,
Theodore Henri de Montreuil"...

267
00:34:11,164 --> 00:34:13,125
Who is Theodore Henry?

268
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,377
..."beat by 9 metres"...

269
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:19,923
..."the record for Human-Canonball
established by Mr. Grampee in 66"! Ha!

270
00:34:20,215 --> 00:34:24,052
"Beat by 9 metres!"

271
00:34:28,932 --> 00:34:29,766
Yes!

272
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:35,355
Give it to me, kid?
Oh no.

273
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:37,149
Ah yes, please, give me.

274
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:39,901
But no...
If you give to me...

275
00:34:40,193 --> 00:34:42,279
You autograph my T-shirt, then.

276
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,784
"T. Henri"...

277
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:49,536
Thierry Henri.

278
00:34:49,828 --> 00:34:52,164
Fracasso, I have a job for you.

279
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:54,416
I'm not joking...

280
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:57,210
...but I think
there's a catch.

281
00:34:57,502 --> 00:34:59,796
You've an idea in mind?

282
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,467
Mister poses a mystery.

283
00:35:03,717 --> 00:35:06,511
Well, who cares, you're not curious.

284
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:19,357
Oh...Oh!

285
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:27,324
What time?

286
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,203
Tomorrow, 10am,
opposite the tomb of Sacha Guitry.

287
00:35:55,143 --> 00:35:56,311
Mister Marconi?

288
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:59,815
I am the messenger
of Omar Boulounga.

289
00:36:00,565 --> 00:36:03,068
Omar Boulounga...
The former dictator...?

290
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,405
The former and the next.
He's preparing a revolution.

291
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,033
I don't have a polical view.

292
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:14,037
We require rifles, grenades and mines.

293
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:17,916
And the DGA, the Export Committee,
the Ottawa Treaty?

294
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:20,168
You have the weapons.
In stock.

295
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,338
You don't have an export sector in Zamibia.

296
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,465
We'd like one.

297
00:36:25,757 --> 00:36:29,177
And this should interest me?
Check us out.

298
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:34,558
We'll give you double the cash and more...
in diamonds if the coup succeeds.

299
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:35,809
Continue.

300
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:37,978
Mr. Bouloungas' national account...

301
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,771
...the diamond mines...

302
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:43,149
Don't Sneeze!
Think of something, fast!

303
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:47,445
Zebras are white with black stripes
or black with white stripes?

304
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:48,863
Oh, pygmies!

305
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:52,033
Are there dwarfs among pygmies?

306
00:36:52,325 --> 00:36:54,327
Why do we say "CIA" and not "If-E-O"?

307
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:57,247
Or "FBI-Ouch" and not "FBI?

308
00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:58,582
Think...

309
00:36:58,873 --> 00:37:01,918
...but do not delay too much,
we returned to Conakry on Monday.

310
00:37:28,194 --> 00:37:29,112
You!

311
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:31,865
Yes, You!

312
00:37:32,157 --> 00:37:34,367
I don't know what your shenanigans
are about...

313
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:38,121
...but either you go and continue
doing everything by yourself...

314
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:41,291
...or you stay and ask us for help.

315
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:43,251
Am I clear?

316
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:45,503
Some of them want to help me?

317
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:46,838
What?

318
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:52,218
I found the manufacturer of the bullet
that killed my father.

319
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,806
I need to do two things at once
I can't do it alone.

320
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,938
Stick together...

321
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:13,865
They're the watchmen.

322
00:38:14,157 --> 00:38:16,785
Inside is the dealer.

323
00:38:17,035 --> 00:38:19,996
The drug's hidden in the mailbox.

324
00:38:20,288 --> 00:38:22,582
That way, if they're ever searched...

325
00:38:22,874 --> 00:38:25,293
...they are white as snow. Let's go!

326
00:38:36,054 --> 00:38:40,642
You've already done it for the crash
and whiplash at the same time?

327
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:42,185
You're old school.

328
00:38:47,607 --> 00:38:48,525
Yes?

329
00:38:48,817 --> 00:38:51,778
Asbestos Control. A problem was reported.

330
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,280
But there's no asbestos here!

331
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,409
We didn't find asbestos in
the devil vauvert.

332
00:38:58,701 --> 00:38:59,744
From the crack of dawn...

333
00:39:00,036 --> 00:39:02,413
...we dealt with that problem.

334
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:05,333
So, no need to rock the boat.

335
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:06,709
Ah!

336
00:39:07,293 --> 00:39:08,795
Oh! But...

337
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:11,256
The widow told me she'd
never leave.

338
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:14,843
Wherever I go, it's on my back.

339
00:39:15,134 --> 00:39:16,177
Hats off!

340
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:40,702
And my receipt?

341
00:39:40,994 --> 00:39:43,162
The more one drinks, the more one is right!

342
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:04,851
The boarding hall, please?

343
00:40:08,313 --> 00:40:12,984
My brother, you want a magical necklace?
Get you into heaven.

344
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:16,487
This powder wards off evil spirits.

345
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:18,197
But yes! Ha! Ha!

346
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:20,908
Ah, you're the boss? Commander!

347
00:40:28,082 --> 00:40:29,083
Here!

348
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,210
It will protect you against the devil...

349
00:40:31,502 --> 00:40:32,670
...and the vagaries of fait.

350
00:40:32,962 --> 00:40:35,965
Incense that'll allow you to contact
the deceased.

351
00:40:36,257 --> 00:40:40,595
Let the passengers be!
I've told you a 100 times!

352
00:40:40,887 --> 00:40:42,847
This is your last warning. Get away!

353
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:47,393
Sorry, gentlemen.
I wish you a safe journey.

354
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:06,829
Excuse me, please sir.

355
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:08,039
Hello.

356
00:41:08,331 --> 00:41:09,957
We're after a flight to America.

357
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:11,793
The departure hall?

358
00:41:12,085 --> 00:41:14,253
Yes, we're off to Manhattan to visit...

359
00:41:14,545 --> 00:41:15,546
...my son.

360
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:19,092
You must register your baggage before.

361
00:41:19,384 --> 00:41:20,718
She's the stepsister...

362
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,930
...my son who left in 1989 for New York.

363
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,059
New York...
You're talking to me?

364
00:41:28,768 --> 00:41:30,019
In 1988.

365
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:31,562
On December 12, 1988.

366
00:42:04,804 --> 00:42:06,931
*Last call for Conakry*

367
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:09,267
*Lufthansa Flight 202*

368
00:42:14,313 --> 00:42:16,524
The vertebra of Tino Rossi.

369
00:42:18,776 --> 00:42:21,195
Winston Churchills
Fingernail clippings.

370
00:42:24,448 --> 00:42:26,117
The molar of Marilyn...

371
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:28,786
Monroe.

372
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:34,083
The foot of Salma Lazarus...

373
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,960
Heart of Louis XVI.

374
00:42:36,252 --> 00:42:37,920
The finger of Matisse.

375
00:42:39,714 --> 00:42:41,841
The eye of Mussolini...

376
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:52,476
It is expected that the DGA launched
the study and called the Saudis...

377
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:56,647
Yes, it was an individual effort more
than group...rather well done.

378
00:42:58,024 --> 00:43:00,902
Well, they will not provide the
source code.

379
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:05,615
If it works?
Remember the Sarajevo market...

380
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:26,385
Collateral damage added value
in the media.

381
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,480
But of course...

382
00:43:42,401 --> 00:43:44,570
That's why it kills me to say.

383
00:43:45,529 --> 00:43:47,281
You and I, we work...

384
00:43:48,366 --> 00:43:50,493
...in the defense industry...

385
00:43:50,785 --> 00:43:52,745
...not in the attack industry.

386
00:43:53,037 --> 00:43:55,247
I beg you, dear friend.

387
00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:57,792
You are always welcome.

388
00:43:58,542 --> 00:43:59,877
My respects to madame.

389
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:43,504
Appointment at 5 pm Train Bleu restaurant:
The eye of Mussolini has arrived.

390
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:55,599
I'm already 10 minutes late,
hurry!

391
00:44:59,728 --> 00:45:00,896
What was that, Maurice?

392
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:03,065
"It's Stephen", sir.
Stephen, yes!

393
00:45:03,357 --> 00:45:06,610
We have a puncture, I think.
Sorry, I'll see.

394
00:45:09,947 --> 00:45:11,115
Peasant!

395
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:33,554
Hello.

396
00:45:33,846 --> 00:45:37,099
I have a reservation
in the name of De Fenouillet.

397
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:39,518
Yes.
You are expected.

398
00:45:45,232 --> 00:45:47,610
I am Mr. De Fenouillet's right hand.

399
00:45:47,902 --> 00:45:51,822
He asked me to tell you that the
Eye of Mussolini interests him

400
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:56,619
In exchange for Achilles heel and
Adam's apple of...

401
00:46:01,749 --> 00:46:04,960
1, 2, 3...test.
1, 2, 3...test.

402
00:46:05,252 --> 00:46:08,213
I am the messenger of Omar Boulounga.

403
00:46:24,355 --> 00:46:26,398
Go ahead, make me an offer.

404
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,985
Do not put the cart
before the horse. It will save us...

405
00:46:30,277 --> 00:46:32,696
...from having 2 feet
in the same hoof.

406
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,158
If you have the Eye of Mussolini...

407
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:39,578
...I'll give you the molar of Marilyn.

408
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:40,829
It's worth it.

409
00:46:41,538 --> 00:46:43,957
I've got the finger of Matisse
and fingernails Churchill...

410
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:47,044
...name the price.
What say you, Mr. Lazarus?

411
00:46:48,671 --> 00:46:51,298
Mr. Lazarus has had a setback,
he had to leave.

412
00:46:52,466 --> 00:46:55,427
Unfortunately,
Mr. Lazarus has had to stand you up.

413
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:57,513
He's returned to his household.

414
00:46:58,055 --> 00:46:59,139
Who are you?

415
00:47:00,766 --> 00:47:04,144
I am the messenger of Omar Boulounga.

416
00:47:05,562 --> 00:47:06,689
Boulounga?

417
00:47:07,564 --> 00:47:09,817
I thought...
We were done?

418
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:10,984
Nay.

419
00:47:11,902 --> 00:47:13,570
A popular revolution...

420
00:47:14,697 --> 00:47:16,615
A popular revolution...

421
00:47:16,907 --> 00:47:19,451
...Omar will return where
Omar belongs.

422
00:47:20,494 --> 00:47:22,287
I'm not interested in politics.

423
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:24,081
It doesn't feed you bread...

424
00:47:28,836 --> 00:47:30,212
Double the cash...

425
00:47:30,504 --> 00:47:31,880
...plus more diamonds...

426
00:47:32,172 --> 00:47:33,173
...if the usurper...

427
00:47:33,465 --> 00:47:37,469
...takes to his heels
and we get back Boulounga.

428
00:47:40,556 --> 00:47:41,974
When, how and where?

429
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:45,227
Tuesday, 27th, one of your men.
Just one...

430
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:49,148
...will be at the station
at 14.45 with the samples.

431
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,776
He'll buy a ticket for
Crecy-la-Chapelle and leave...

432
00:47:53,068 --> 00:47:54,194
...with a deposit...

433
00:47:54,486 --> 00:47:55,571
...of 30% Cash...

434
00:47:55,863 --> 00:47:58,157
...dollars and cents.

435
00:48:01,368 --> 00:48:04,163
Well?
The operator's transferring me.

436
00:48:04,455 --> 00:48:07,332
Marconi?
Omar Boulounga in person.

437
00:48:07,624 --> 00:48:10,252
So you thought?
Ha! Ha!

438
00:48:10,544 --> 00:48:13,046
Congratulations, you're now looking
at noon to 2pm.

439
00:48:13,338 --> 00:48:15,841
I didn't invent sliced bread...

440
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:19,011
...but I don't mistake candles
for lanterns.

441
00:48:19,303 --> 00:48:21,680
Well, I want one man
present...

442
00:48:21,972 --> 00:48:25,184
... with samples at the Eastern
railway station tomorrow at 14:45.

443
00:48:25,475 --> 00:48:28,937
He'll get a ticket
for La Ferte-Milon.

444
00:48:29,229 --> 00:48:32,774
He'll leave with the 1st
installment of the order. ok?

445
00:48:33,066 --> 00:48:34,234
Right. Ok!

446
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:41,074
Ready for more, guys?

447
00:48:42,367 --> 00:48:43,493
Why "guys"?

448
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,791
Well, because there'll be action.

449
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:53,086
Ah! When there's action, it's not for girls?

450
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:56,423
Preconception...

451
00:48:56,715 --> 00:48:58,216
Uh...

452
00:49:00,218 --> 00:49:01,762
You're not a real...

453
00:49:02,638 --> 00:49:03,722
Real what?

454
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:08,268
A real girl! Is that it?

455
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,811
I wouldn't say that.

456
00:49:10,103 --> 00:49:11,104
If that's it.

457
00:49:11,396 --> 00:49:14,107
No.
Is it! Is that what you wanted to say.

458
00:49:14,399 --> 00:49:15,358
No.

459
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:19,738
Did you mean I'm a 'Tomboy'?

460
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,490
That's right.

461
00:49:21,782 --> 00:49:25,786
When I have to fold into a bag,
I'm in the club!

462
00:49:50,268 --> 00:49:53,188
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
arms traffickers...</i>

463
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,358
<i>...currently waiting in the station.</i>

464
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,235
<i>Be vigilant.</i>

465
00:49:59,069 --> 00:50:02,948
<i>Don't buy a land mine from
a dealer on the run.</i>

466
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,868
<i>You risk him using it.</i>

467
00:50:07,828 --> 00:50:09,663
<i>Thank you for your attention.</i>

468
00:50:39,401 --> 00:50:42,696
Wow! What's that?

469
00:50:42,988 --> 00:50:46,283
1 kg 720 steel,
350 grams of polycarbonate...

470
00:50:46,575 --> 00:50:48,243
...70 grammes of kevlar.

471
00:50:51,746 --> 00:50:54,082
And that's not a small Uzi is it?

472
00:50:54,374 --> 00:50:57,210
It's a MAC 10, maybe even 11.

473
00:50:57,502 --> 00:50:59,087
No, no!

474
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,340
You step on it and it'll take your foot!

475
00:51:02,632 --> 00:51:03,516
Oh...

476
00:51:04,009 --> 00:51:05,594
Or your life, perhaps.

477
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:16,980
Hold there!

478
00:51:17,272 --> 00:51:19,649
That's for recycling!
It's not for us.

479
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:22,903
I didn't recycle it,
it fell off the back of a tank!

480
00:51:23,195 --> 00:51:24,362
Confiscated!

481
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:26,698
It's a nasty game!

482
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,659
If you want to be Al Capone, go to Chicago!

483
00:51:29,951 --> 00:51:30,827
Ah... if I wasn't here...

484
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,581
Ready for Phase 2?
Strike while the iron is hot!

485
00:51:34,873 --> 00:51:37,209
Let's draw!

486
00:51:38,084 --> 00:51:40,086
De Fenouillet, here's Boulounga.

487
00:51:40,378 --> 00:51:42,631
Your man didn't turn up!

488
00:51:42,923 --> 00:51:46,593
The deal is obsolete.
Vigilante Armament offered me better.

489
00:51:46,885 --> 00:51:51,264
Make a cross on the diamonds and
butter in the spinach.

490
00:52:18,416 --> 00:52:20,126
Marconi Boulounga for Omar.

491
00:52:20,418 --> 00:52:22,754
If you could do it a bit more sober.

492
00:52:23,046 --> 00:52:25,215
Marconi? Boulounga is pissed!

493
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:28,718
Your boy took to his heels.

494
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,595
The deal is dead and gone.

495
00:52:30,887 --> 00:52:35,308
Aubervilliers Armaments are
better customers. Goodbye!

496
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:33,742
Tambouille,
I have to go out between 1 and 2pm.

497
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:35,869
Your 2 sharks have taken the bait?

498
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:39,330
For now, they're biting.
I'm...

499
00:53:39,622 --> 00:53:40,915
...just going to sweeten the pot!

500
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,128
But when it bites, it will be well hooked...

501
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,714
It's big.
Then I...

502
00:53:48,006 --> 00:53:51,676
Then 'We'...
We'll turn the screws.

503
00:53:52,385 --> 00:53:54,554
No, not until we see their faces.

504
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:00,894
Not Gay, Gay.
Lookout!

505
00:54:01,186 --> 00:54:02,520
Lookout.

506
00:54:03,062 --> 00:54:04,772
Yes. Oh well...

507
00:54:05,064 --> 00:54:08,860
I need volunteers to go on the roofs.
Thank you, calculator.

508
00:54:09,152 --> 00:54:12,655
It's good to have people who count.

509
00:54:13,156 --> 00:54:14,032
Good...

510
00:54:21,247 --> 00:54:23,666
Uh...where are you going then?

511
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,502
Well, wherever you go.

512
00:54:26,503 --> 00:54:29,881
Excuse me,
but I must handle a delicate matter.

513
00:54:30,173 --> 00:54:31,799
I prefer to go alone.

514
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:34,928
Ah, I understand.

515
00:54:35,512 --> 00:54:38,223
It's true that in matters of delicacy...

516
00:54:38,515 --> 00:54:41,226
...and even subtlety...

517
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:45,897
...you're an expert.

518
00:55:03,122 --> 00:55:05,917
"The diva of porn",
she'll please you!

519
00:55:06,209 --> 00:55:08,211
Something of a pencil sharpener!

520
00:55:09,003 --> 00:55:12,757
Great, but do you own a nightgown.

521
00:55:13,049 --> 00:55:14,384
I sleep naked.

522
00:55:14,676 --> 00:55:15,969
Hey, Henry...

523
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:18,054
...you spell Henri...

524
00:55:18,346 --> 00:55:20,181
...not with a Y but with an I.

525
00:55:23,726 --> 00:55:25,019
Oh? Are you sure?

526
00:55:25,311 --> 00:55:27,188
Thierry Henri?
Yeah.

527
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,817
It would be wrong, Thierry Henry?

528
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:35,280
Do not worry, I'm always game
for the Cyclops sneeze.

529
00:55:35,822 --> 00:55:38,283
Well, we'll do as you ask?
Yeah.

530
00:55:39,575 --> 00:55:41,452
Soon.
This evening.

531
00:55:48,543 --> 00:55:49,666
What?

532
00:55:50,175 --> 00:55:51,200
I thought...

533
00:55:51,212 --> 00:55:54,882
...you're fishing for shark,
not cod or herring!

534
00:55:57,093 --> 00:55:58,302
We're not married.

535
00:56:00,221 --> 00:56:01,889
No, we're not married.

536
00:56:02,932 --> 00:56:05,768
Anyway,
perverts are not my thing.

537
00:56:06,894 --> 00:56:09,564
Mine's like...
with contortionists.

538
00:56:09,856 --> 00:56:13,109
My mother always told me
to distrust twisted...

539
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:16,279
I am not twisted.

540
00:56:19,157 --> 00:56:22,785
I am a sensitive soul
in a flexible body.

541
00:56:23,077 --> 00:56:24,412
That's not the same

542
00:56:33,504 --> 00:56:35,298
Hello?
Listen to me.

543
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:36,549
You listen to me!

544
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:37,967
Camel!

545
00:56:38,259 --> 00:56:40,178
I despise your shenanigans!

546
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,972
Put the Boulounga diamonds
where you like!

547
00:56:43,264 --> 00:56:47,477
You want to play the bloody idiot? You want
that I take out more teeth, fingers...

548
00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:52,356
...and bones of the Assyrian kings.
More looting of the Baghdad museum...

549
00:56:52,648 --> 00:56:55,359
If you want war,
think twice about it!

550
00:56:56,986 --> 00:56:59,071
When one is fortunate to have divorced...

551
00:56:59,363 --> 00:57:01,991
...to advantage, one doesn't choose
as a mistress...

552
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:04,535
...the wife of the Prime Minister.

553
00:57:05,161 --> 00:57:09,290
I also have the recording at home.

554
00:58:19,026 --> 00:58:20,695
Well, I gotta say...

555
00:58:20,987 --> 00:58:24,073
...that Grandpa and Grandma
did it in the dark...

556
00:58:24,365 --> 00:58:27,827
So doing it in front of everyone...

557
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:31,455
...is just a little more dramatic...

558
00:58:31,747 --> 00:58:36,002
...a little more creative,
a little more flexible, right?

559
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,589
Bazil! Hey!

560
00:58:40,881 --> 00:58:41,841
Boo!

561
00:58:45,511 --> 00:58:46,429
Oh...

562
00:58:55,521 --> 00:58:56,480
Let's go.

563
00:59:09,785 --> 00:59:14,790
There... I'm not too much girl
to act like an alley cat?

564
00:59:15,374 --> 00:59:18,627
No, precisely why we needed a person...

565
00:59:18,919 --> 00:59:19,837
Flexible!

566
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:25,384
We needed someone like you,
feline and female.

567
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:32,368
Oh dear...

568
01:02:17,222 --> 01:02:18,766
Marignan?
1515.

569
01:02:19,058 --> 01:02:20,809
Nagasaki?
17 kilotonnes.

570
01:02:21,101 --> 01:02:22,019
Kiss?

571
01:02:31,695 --> 01:02:32,863
Hello, sir.

572
01:02:33,155 --> 01:02:37,493
Something happened during the night.
It's most unusual.

573
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:45,626
Sir!

574
01:02:49,505 --> 01:02:52,424
Come on, Maurice.
"Stephen", Sir.

575
01:03:10,734 --> 01:03:13,487
I have a delivery for
Mr. De Fenouillet

576
01:03:13,779 --> 01:03:16,698
You're out of luck,
he just left.

577
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:18,242
Leave it to me.

578
01:03:18,534 --> 01:03:20,327
It's a bit heavy.

579
01:03:20,619 --> 01:03:21,370
Ah...

580
01:03:24,206 --> 01:03:25,290
Go ahead.

581
01:03:31,672 --> 01:03:32,756
There.

582
01:04:11,003 --> 01:04:13,839
7 metres, 50 centimetres, 4 millimetres.

583
01:04:45,078 --> 01:04:47,956
The same rubber

584
01:04:48,248 --> 01:04:50,959
With her, you can go crazy

585
01:04:52,836 --> 01:04:54,379
She'll send you funny in the head

586
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:56,632
It seeks the above

587
01:04:56,923 --> 01:04:59,551
And is found below

588
01:05:00,093 --> 01:05:04,681
The same rubber

589
01:05:25,202 --> 01:05:27,162
Child!

590
01:05:27,704 --> 01:05:30,374
You've washed your hands?
YES!

591
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:32,584
Let's see.

592
01:05:32,876 --> 01:05:34,628
Hey, you!

593
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,673
There is no laughing at the table.

594
01:05:41,176 --> 01:05:43,428
How are you going,
with your merchants of death?

595
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,557
They're hooked! The more they struggle
the more their trapped.

596
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:50,268
Oh... When I think of
those poor mothers...

597
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,188
...who lose their children
because of mines.

598
01:05:55,482 --> 01:05:57,150
You know Tambouille?

599
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:01,530
She had 2 little girls.
One evening at the Foire du Trône...

600
01:06:01,822 --> 01:06:03,949
...she saw them enter
the labyrinth.

601
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:05,909
She never saw them come out.

602
01:06:06,201 --> 01:06:09,704
For years, she has searched
the streets.

603
01:06:09,996 --> 01:06:12,082
Eventually, she became a tramp.

604
01:06:12,374 --> 01:06:15,460
And after all that,
She adopted us.

605
01:06:15,752 --> 01:06:16,837
Fifififi...

606
01:06:17,129 --> 01:06:19,339
Enough, my lowly masses.

607
01:06:20,215 --> 01:06:22,217
What can you see my
little salty?

608
01:06:22,509 --> 01:06:25,137
Fats: 62%, proteins: 4%...
OH!

609
01:06:25,387 --> 01:06:26,304
Ben who?

610
01:06:26,596 --> 01:06:29,224
A little salty is as it should be...

611
01:06:29,474 --> 01:06:32,185
...a black belt
at Cordon Bleu.

612
01:06:32,477 --> 01:06:33,979
Oh, surely not...

613
01:06:34,271 --> 01:06:36,314
Even if...oh no.

614
01:06:36,606 --> 01:06:39,359
You've got an idea for cooking
your 2 big fish?

615
01:06:39,651 --> 01:06:42,654
Frying.
There's more to roll in flour.

616
01:06:44,531 --> 01:06:45,615
In the flour!

617
01:07:22,444 --> 01:07:26,364
Fracasse, you sure?
No! He's okay.

618
01:07:33,121 --> 01:07:35,582
Go! We we will do Fracasse's final checks!

619
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:48,011
Calculator!

620
01:07:48,303 --> 01:07:49,721
Distance: 138 meters.

621
01:07:50,013 --> 01:07:52,641
Wind Speed: 12 km/h,
Direction South/SouthWest.

622
01:07:52,891 --> 01:07:54,434
There.
Weight of the projectile?

623
01:07:54,726 --> 01:07:56,102
76 kilos.

624
01:07:56,394 --> 01:07:59,064
Add 4.
It's Tambouilles fault.

625
01:07:59,356 --> 01:08:00,774
OK...say 80.

626
01:08:01,066 --> 01:08:02,484
Why did you add more?

627
01:08:02,776 --> 01:08:06,237
Slice: 70 grammes.
Butter: 37 g. Jam...

628
01:08:06,529 --> 01:08:08,615
Okay, okay!
Come on, get ready.

629
01:08:17,999 --> 01:08:19,334
Remington!

630
01:08:20,293 --> 01:08:22,170
For the committees approval!

631
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:24,506
Engine!

632
01:08:30,929 --> 01:08:32,263
It's time to go.

633
01:08:32,555 --> 01:08:35,433
No, it's too early. 59...

634
01:08:37,394 --> 01:08:38,895
58...

635
01:08:39,187 --> 01:08:40,563
57...

636
01:08:41,856 --> 01:08:42,649
56...

637
01:08:44,442 --> 01:08:46,111
55 seconds.

638
01:08:46,403 --> 01:08:47,404
Oh!

639
01:08:57,247 --> 01:08:58,498
Closet, what happened?

640
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:03,128
What? It's recycled!
It's old...

641
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:04,295
Oh!

642
01:09:17,684 --> 01:09:18,685
Closet!

643
01:09:19,602 --> 01:09:21,604
You Bastard!

644
01:09:22,564 --> 01:09:24,149
But it's recycled!

645
01:10:18,661 --> 01:10:19,579
Fire!

646
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:38,491
Watchout!

647
01:11:45,206 --> 01:11:46,332
Come on, move!

648
01:11:51,629 --> 01:11:52,380
Watchout!!

649
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:21,534
No batteries?!
How?!

650
01:12:21,826 --> 01:12:23,828
It's recycled.
It's recycled?

651
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,498
I broke the altitude record!
And I had proof!

652
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:28,916
One Minute, butterfly!

653
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:30,042
What?

654
01:12:30,334 --> 01:12:34,797
I devoted myself to the the filming!
That's the last straw!

655
01:12:35,089 --> 01:12:36,799
No Battery!

656
01:12:40,636 --> 01:12:43,556
It's an unwritten law:
One key to the equipment.

657
01:12:43,931 --> 01:12:45,141
It's going to explode.

658
01:12:45,433 --> 01:12:48,519
It's her.
Code 5, no quarter.

659
01:12:53,482 --> 01:12:56,444
You are Madame Cisse?
Yes.

660
01:12:56,736 --> 01:12:58,279
Your husband has a problem.

661
01:12:58,946 --> 01:13:00,948
What happened?

662
01:13:01,782 --> 01:13:05,161
Your husband is ashamed:
He lost your residency permit.

663
01:13:05,953 --> 01:13:07,663
Then I only have to request a duplicate.

664
01:13:07,955 --> 01:13:11,334
That's what I organised with
Edward Mangin...

665
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:13,586
... my friend the Prefect of Police.

666
01:13:13,878 --> 01:13:15,588
But your record as not been found.

667
01:13:16,297 --> 01:13:18,424
But I assure you...

668
01:13:18,716 --> 01:13:20,051
Why have you done this?

669
01:13:21,469 --> 01:13:22,386
Who are you?

670
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:26,599
I'm part of the company that
employs your husband.

671
01:13:26,891 --> 01:13:29,352
You see, our activities relate to...

672
01:13:29,644 --> 01:13:31,187
...national defense.

673
01:13:31,479 --> 01:13:32,897
At the same time, obviously...

674
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:35,900
...we feel obliged to protect children...

675
01:13:36,192 --> 01:13:40,196
I always try to put pressure on
my friend Mangin

676
01:13:40,488 --> 01:13:42,657
That's good,
I'm seeing him tomorrow night.

677
01:13:42,949 --> 01:13:44,909
I know, you know what?

678
01:13:47,662 --> 01:13:48,704
Show him.

679
01:13:50,122 --> 01:13:52,458
In Naval shipyards,
they have the same machine.

680
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,335
You see where it is?

681
01:13:54,627 --> 01:13:56,754
It's essential, it must be installed with...

682
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:59,674
...the bulkhead opening on the outside...

683
01:13:59,924 --> 01:14:01,008
...like that.

684
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:04,553
This has been done to guide the air out...

685
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:06,347
...in case of...

686
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:11,060
...the technician activating the machine
from behind the door...

687
01:14:11,352 --> 01:14:13,396
Ideally we would proceed...

688
01:14:13,688 --> 01:14:17,024
...during lunch, when the machine is paused.

689
01:14:17,316 --> 01:14:19,193
What should I do?
Almost nothing.

690
01:14:19,485 --> 01:14:23,781
You unscrew the small tube here,
you slide the steel ball out...

691
01:14:24,073 --> 01:14:26,283
...and that's all.

692
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:29,245
It's dangerous?

693
01:14:29,537 --> 01:14:31,831
Returning to Somalia...
is dangerous too.

694
01:14:32,498 --> 01:14:34,542
I put it where?
Ah!

695
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:39,296
Do not bother to clean the
dust underneath.

696
01:15:12,288 --> 01:15:14,373
Do you have a minute?

697
01:15:17,793 --> 01:15:20,588
It's forbidden to park here
with this load.

698
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,048
Don't worry, I'll be quick.

699
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:18,312
By God!

700
01:16:43,379 --> 01:16:46,090
That's strange.
Usually, he warns me.

701
01:16:46,382 --> 01:16:49,385
In the time of his father,
you would not have come.

702
01:16:51,303 --> 01:16:52,596
There's nothing to sign?
No.

703
01:16:52,888 --> 01:16:54,014
Thank you very much.

704
01:17:05,693 --> 01:17:08,946
Bazil, this blackmail evidence, what is it?

705
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:11,073
It may be a video...

706
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:14,243
...tape, envelopes,
photos...

707
01:17:14,535 --> 01:17:16,745
It can be anything
and anywhere.

708
01:17:17,663 --> 01:17:18,872
Thank's for the clarification.

709
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:21,083
it's somewhere there.

710
01:17:23,085 --> 01:17:24,503
That slab...

711
01:17:33,429 --> 01:17:34,888
Where's this package?

712
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:37,641
I understand, it was there.

713
01:17:37,933 --> 01:17:39,476
The nanny has put it away?

714
01:17:39,768 --> 01:17:42,146
No, your son is with his mother.

715
01:17:42,438 --> 01:17:44,481
His mother...
Ah yes, true.

716
01:17:44,773 --> 01:17:46,358
Get me the package.

717
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:49,695
I assure you...
Just go.

718
01:17:51,989 --> 01:17:53,657
Oh, this'll be sweet...

719
01:18:01,331 --> 01:18:03,751
<i>this afternoon in the
Naval shipyards of Aubervilliers...</i>

720
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:06,253
<i>...it did extensive damage.</i>

721
01:18:06,545 --> 01:18:08,422
<i>No casualties were reported.</i>

722
01:18:08,714 --> 01:18:11,759
<i>An investigation is underway
to determine the cause.</i>

723
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:15,637
<i>...recall the CEO
Nicolas Thibault de Fenouillet...</i>

724
01:18:15,929 --> 01:18:18,891
<i>...has been cited in cases of
influencing the deal...</i>

725
01:18:19,183 --> 01:18:21,977
<i>...but he's not been replaced at this time.</i>

726
01:18:22,269 --> 01:18:24,313
<i>- I defy anyone to make...
- Rubbish.</i>

727
01:18:24,605 --> 01:18:26,273
<i>...no tangible evidence!*</i>

728
01:18:26,565 --> 01:18:28,609
<i>It's a scandal!</i>

729
01:18:28,901 --> 01:18:30,611
<i>Ongoing information on LCI.</i>

730
01:18:50,255 --> 01:18:52,883
Calm, calm...Breath.

731
01:18:55,802 --> 01:18:59,097
Practice:
The key issues.

732
01:18:59,389 --> 01:19:00,933
Number 12: Who...

733
01:19:01,225 --> 01:19:03,477
...invents jokes?

734
01:19:03,769 --> 01:19:07,773
No. 27: Why is the place we seek on a
map always in the fold?

735
01:19:08,065 --> 01:19:11,568
No. 62:
How much erosion is caused by walking?

736
01:19:16,323 --> 01:19:18,951
<i>The CEO,
Nicolas Thibault de Fenouillet...</i>

737
01:19:19,201 --> 01:19:22,537
<i>...has been cited with charges
of influencing the sales...</i>

738
01:19:22,829 --> 01:19:24,915
<i>...and has been fired.</i>

739
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:27,459
Ah! Rubbish!

740
01:19:27,751 --> 01:19:29,127
<i>...no tangible evidence!</i>

741
01:19:29,419 --> 01:19:30,170
<i>It's a setup.</i>

742
01:19:30,462 --> 01:19:32,839
<i>Ongoing information on LCI.</i>

743
01:19:39,763 --> 01:19:41,765
So you want war?

744
01:19:42,057 --> 01:19:43,976
Well it will be a Blitzkrieg!

745
01:19:44,268 --> 01:19:45,769
Sir, we have to go?

746
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:47,271
Go!

747
01:19:47,854 --> 01:19:49,606
Go.
Go.

748
01:19:50,148 --> 01:19:51,358
Go!

749
01:20:29,062 --> 01:20:30,355
Ah! What now!...

750
01:20:51,251 --> 01:20:52,127
That's it then?

751
01:20:53,837 --> 01:20:56,923
You thought we'd rot in prison?

752
01:20:57,549 --> 01:21:00,469
You're impressed by our resolve?

753
01:21:11,438 --> 01:21:13,064
Exercise # 8: Money...

754
01:21:13,356 --> 01:21:16,401
Dough, cash, money, moola, wonga,
lucre, grease...

755
01:21:16,693 --> 01:21:19,404
...dosh, pennies!

756
01:21:35,712 --> 01:21:36,755
Yeah!

757
01:22:07,953 --> 01:22:08,870
No!

758
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:12,666
Tut tut tut...Hush.

759
01:22:14,751 --> 01:22:15,835
Oh...

760
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:53,081
Oh! No!

761
01:23:01,673 --> 01:23:04,384
I came to teach you a little lesson...

762
01:23:04,676 --> 01:23:08,930
...but these clowns gave me another idea.

763
01:23:12,142 --> 01:23:13,727
Oh no...

764
01:23:15,312 --> 01:23:16,438
How?

765
01:23:19,441 --> 01:23:21,401
You'd never take such a risk.

766
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,695
What risk?

767
01:23:25,196 --> 01:23:30,201
You refused to sell arms to rebels
who were formenting a coup.

768
01:23:30,493 --> 01:23:33,038
They planted a bomb in the
Naval shipyards...

769
01:23:33,330 --> 01:23:35,498
...before coming to attack you!

770
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:38,543
We rushed to your aid...

771
01:23:39,544 --> 01:23:40,795
Isn't that so, Libarski?

772
01:23:41,087 --> 01:23:43,006
We arrived a bit too late.

773
01:23:44,632 --> 01:23:46,092
This is perfect.

774
01:23:46,384 --> 01:23:47,677
Wait, wait...

775
01:24:06,529 --> 01:24:07,363
Ah!

776
01:24:07,655 --> 01:24:10,158
I'll give you the tape with the evidence.

777
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:13,203
The teeth, the fingers,
the looting of Baghdad Museum.

778
01:24:13,495 --> 01:24:15,955
You take it and you leave.

779
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:20,293
It's not enough.

780
01:24:20,585 --> 01:24:23,546
Oh, okay,
stop your bullshit!

781
01:24:26,049 --> 01:24:28,676
Ok,
I would not have sabotaged your plant.

782
01:24:28,927 --> 01:24:30,637
But you stole my shells.

783
01:24:32,138 --> 01:24:33,056
What shells?

784
01:24:33,932 --> 01:24:35,350
Well...

785
01:24:36,017 --> 01:24:37,560
...the ammo truck.

786
01:24:38,686 --> 01:24:40,814
You stole an amunition truck.

787
01:24:41,105 --> 01:24:42,774
We did what?
No.

788
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:44,776
It wasn't us.

789
01:24:46,236 --> 01:24:47,612
The truck, wasn't me.

790
01:24:47,904 --> 01:24:50,406
It was probably them.

791
01:24:51,574 --> 01:24:54,202
Yes, it must be them.

792
01:24:54,661 --> 01:24:57,121
Him...it's him!

793
01:24:57,413 --> 01:25:00,250
He was spotted in the video!

794
01:25:00,542 --> 01:25:02,085
He was disguised as a server!

795
01:25:02,377 --> 01:25:04,504
I thought he worked for you.

796
01:25:04,796 --> 01:25:06,172
I thought he worked for you...

797
01:25:06,464 --> 01:25:07,799
...dirty trick number 2.

798
01:25:08,091 --> 01:25:11,219
What madness!
Who do you work for?

799
01:25:11,511 --> 01:25:15,348
Er...I'm on my own.

800
01:25:16,891 --> 01:25:18,893
I have a bachelor flat.

801
01:25:19,185 --> 01:25:20,770
We'll question him there?

802
01:25:21,062 --> 01:25:22,814
My car is outside.

803
01:25:23,106 --> 01:25:24,732
I'm not too early!

804
01:25:25,024 --> 01:25:27,860
You're late.
The problem is over.

805
01:25:28,695 --> 01:25:29,571
That's him.

806
01:25:31,906 --> 01:25:33,116
Oh...

807
01:25:33,992 --> 01:25:36,286
Aeschylus died after...

808
01:25:36,578 --> 01:25:38,162
...a turtle hit him in the head.

809
01:25:38,454 --> 01:25:42,875
Jean-Baptiste Lully,
died of gangrene.

810
01:25:43,167 --> 01:25:47,505
Barbarossa drowned by forgetting to remove
his armor to cross a river.

811
01:25:47,797 --> 01:25:52,635
And me, I'm dying stupidly too,
feeling like a jerk.

812
01:26:34,969 --> 01:26:37,263
Closet, Plan B.

813
01:26:37,555 --> 01:26:42,643
E-m-e-r-g-e-n-c-y!

814
01:28:01,973 --> 01:28:04,600
Everyone out!
Ha! Ha! Ha!

815
01:28:18,823 --> 01:28:20,283
Hop on!

816
01:28:28,291 --> 01:28:30,251
240, 230...

817
01:28:30,543 --> 01:28:32,378
...220, 210...

818
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:37,633
...200, 190, 180, 170...

819
01:28:37,925 --> 01:28:40,344
...160, 150...

820
01:28:42,513 --> 01:28:44,181
...130, 120...

821
01:28:44,473 --> 01:28:47,018
...110, 90, 70...

822
01:28:49,061 --> 01:28:51,022
And...and...and...now!

823
01:28:51,314 --> 01:28:52,773
Dump the trash!

824
01:29:02,617 --> 01:29:03,701
Slowly.

825
01:29:18,049 --> 01:29:19,508
Oh shit...

826
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,594
Garbage pick-up!

827
01:29:56,796 --> 01:29:58,506
They're over us...
on the bridge!

828
01:29:58,798 --> 01:30:01,759
The carrots are cooked,
and you've drawn a blank!

829
01:30:03,677 --> 01:30:05,262
Hope you enjoy the sun.

830
01:30:05,554 --> 01:30:07,890
We're paying for your vacation
to North Africa.

831
01:30:16,148 --> 01:30:18,818
Closet, good landing, thank you

832
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:21,862
He! He! It's...
RECYCLED'!!!

833
01:30:38,879 --> 01:30:39,880
Again!

834
01:30:42,633 --> 01:30:43,676
Again!

835
01:31:31,515 --> 01:31:32,808
You recognise this?

836
01:31:49,992 --> 01:31:53,203
And you, recognise this?

837
01:32:07,593 --> 01:32:10,638
Shhh! Tut tut tut...

838
01:32:10,929 --> 01:32:12,306
Don't move.

839
01:32:13,766 --> 01:32:14,808
Don't move.

840
01:32:30,699 --> 01:32:32,368
You want a ransom?

841
01:32:35,454 --> 01:32:37,956
Demand a price...
we can afford it.

842
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:41,251
I'm Friends...

843
01:32:41,543 --> 01:32:43,462
...with the President of the Republic.

844
01:32:43,754 --> 01:32:47,049
Take away this grenade, it's ridiculous!

845
01:32:47,841 --> 01:32:51,303
We'll call,
you'll see, he will pay

846
01:32:51,595 --> 01:32:53,013
Articulate, idiot!

847
01:32:58,435 --> 01:32:59,645
What do you want?

848
01:33:02,815 --> 01:33:04,775
Sorry...

849
01:33:05,067 --> 01:33:07,111
...for the kids.

850
01:33:09,154 --> 01:33:12,074
Ah yes...
Sorry.

851
01:33:12,366 --> 01:33:13,826
Apologies to the women...

852
01:33:14,118 --> 01:33:16,286
...who are raped
in the wars!

853
01:33:16,578 --> 01:33:19,998
I sell weapons to people
who stop wars.

854
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:21,333
You bastard!

855
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:23,961
You still sell
Landmines!

856
01:33:29,133 --> 01:33:31,844
I'm for terrorism.
Me too.

857
01:33:32,136 --> 01:33:34,430
The Boeing 300 who died in Ankara...

858
01:33:34,721 --> 01:33:37,182
The explosive were ours!

859
01:33:37,474 --> 01:33:40,436
You were using, I was providing...

860
01:33:40,727 --> 01:33:42,312
...ETA and the IRA.

861
01:33:42,604 --> 01:33:46,358
And Darfur, where do you think
they get their explosives from?

862
01:33:47,025 --> 01:33:49,194
You encouraged the markets?

863
01:33:49,486 --> 01:33:51,488
Kind of pathetic!

864
01:37:03,597 --> 01:37:06,600
Video traffickers

865
01:37:19,821 --> 01:37:21,907
Go to YouTube...

866
01:37:22,199 --> 01:37:24,910
...and type
"arms dealers caught".

867
01:37:46,598 --> 01:37:48,975
Guys, come see.

868
01:37:57,692 --> 01:37:59,569
Mr. Marconi, please!

869
01:37:59,861 --> 01:38:02,322
The price of your shares collapsed.

870
01:38:02,614 --> 01:38:06,284
You may serve 15 years.
What's your defense?

871
01:38:06,576 --> 01:38:08,536
We can send you a YouTube link...

872
01:38:11,456 --> 01:38:14,960
Fenouillet dropped by his former
political friends...

873
01:38:15,251 --> 01:38:17,879
...by the President himself...

874
01:38:18,129 --> 01:38:20,423
...has fled to an unknown location...

875
01:38:20,715 --> 01:38:25,553
We expect one day to see the closing
of the Naval shipyards of Aubervilliers.

876
01:38:39,859 --> 01:38:42,278
As soon as the 2 merchants of
death hit the floor...

877
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:46,866
...Bazil, proud as Lucifer,
beat his breast and made amends...

878
01:38:51,371 --> 01:38:53,832
There's no need
to be a genius...

879
01:38:54,124 --> 01:38:57,293
...to understand that they would
see with eyes of Chimene.

880
01:38:57,585 --> 01:38:59,170
And it was no secret...

881
01:38:59,462 --> 01:39:02,132
...they get along like a house on fire.
