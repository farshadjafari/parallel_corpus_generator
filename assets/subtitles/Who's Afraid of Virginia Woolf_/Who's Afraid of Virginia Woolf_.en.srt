1
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,600
- It's 2 o'clock in the morning.
- Oh, George!

2
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,100
Well, it is.

3
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,200
What a cluck you are!

4
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,900
It's late, you know. It's late.

5
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,000
What a dump!

6
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,500
Hey, what's that from? "What a dump!"

7
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,700
How would I know?

8
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,900
Oh, come on, what's it from?
You know!

9
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,200
What's it from, for Christ's sake?

10
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,100
What's what from?

11
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,900
I just told you. I just did it.

12
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
"What a dump!"

13
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Huh? What's that from?

14
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
I haven't the faintest idea.

15
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,300
Dumbbell!

16
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,100
It's from some Bette Davis picture...

17
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
...some goddamn Warner Brothers epic.

18
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,700
Martha, I can't remember all the films
that came out of Warner Brothers.

19
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,100
Nobody's asking you to remember
every Warner Brothers epic.

20
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,600
Just one single little epic.
That's all.

21
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,800
Bette Davis gets peritonitis at the end.

22
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,800
And she wears a fright wig
throughout the picture.

23
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,300
She's married to Joseph Cotten
or something.

24
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Somebody.

25
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,300
She wants to go to Chicago because
she loves that actor with the scar.

26
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,100
She gets sick...

27
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,400
...and sits down at her dressing table...

28
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,300
What actor? What scar?

29
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,400
I can't remember his name!
What's the picture?

30
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
I want to know the name of the picture.

31
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,600
She gets this peritonitis...

32
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,800
...and decides to go to Chicago anyway.

33
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
"Chicago"! It's called "Chicago."

34
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
What is?

35
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,700
I mean the picture. It's "Chicago."

36
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Oh, good grief!

37
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,100
Don't you know anything?

38
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,600
"Chicago" was a '30s musical...

39
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,500
...starring little Miss Alice Faye.
Don't you know anything?

40
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
This picture...

41
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,300
...Bette Davis comes home from
a hard day at the grocery store...

42
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,300
She works in a grocery store?

43
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,300
She's a housewife. She buys things.

44
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
She comes with the groceries...

45
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,300
...and she walks into
the modest living room...

46
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,500
...of the modest cottage
modest Joseph Cotten set her up in.

47
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,700
Are they married?

48
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,700
Yes, they're married.
To each other, cluck!

49
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,200
And she comes in
and she looks around this room...

50
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,000
...and she sets down her groceries.

51
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,900
And she says...

52
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,900
..."What a dump!"

53
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,700
She's discontent.

54
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,400
What's the name of the picture?

55
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,700
I really don't know.

56
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,400
Well, think!

57
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
I'm tired, dear.

58
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,400
I don't know why you're tired.
You didn't do anything today.

59
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,500
- I'm tired.
- You didn't have classes.

60
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,600
If your father didn't always set up
these Saturday night orgies...

61
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,700
Well, it's just too bad about you.

62
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,700
Well, that's how it is anyway.

63
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,400
You didn't do anything. You never do.
You never mix!

64
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,400
You just sit around and talk.

65
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,200
What do you want me to do?
Bray at everyone all night like you do?

66
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,200
I don't bray!

67
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
All right, you don't bray.

68
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,100
I did not bray.

69
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,900
I said you didn't bray!

70
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
Fix me a drink.

71
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,700
Haven't you had enough?

72
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
I said fix me a drink!

73
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,800
Well, I don't suppose a nightcap
would kill either of us.

74
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,900
A nightcap? Are you kidding?

75
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,700
We've got guests.

76
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,900
Got what?

77
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,900
Guests. Guests!

78
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,300
Yeah, guests. People.
We've got guests coming over.

79
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,800
When?

80
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Now.

81
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,100
Good Lord, Martha,
do you know what time it is?

82
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,300
Who's coming over?

83
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,700
- What's-their-name.
- Who?

84
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,100
Who's what's-their-name?

85
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,100
I don't know their name, George.

86
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,100
We met tonight. They're new. He's
in the math department or something.

87
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't remember
meeting anybody tonight.

88
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,800
Well, you did.

89
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,800
Of all the asinine...
Who are these people?

90
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,000
He's in the Math Department.

91
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,100
Who?

92
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,200
He's in the Math Department.
He's young and he's blond...

93
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,500
He's good-looking, well-built?

94
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,300
Yes, good-looking, well-built.

95
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
- It figures.
- What?

96
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,000
Nothing.

97
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,000
His wife's a mousy little type
without any hips or anything.

98
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Remember them now?

99
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,700
I guess so. But why do they
have to come over now?

100
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Because Daddy said
we should be nice to them, that's why.

101
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,300
- Daddy said we should be nice to them.
- Why now...?

102
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,200
Because Daddy said
we should be nice to them!

103
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,000
He didn't mean we were supposed
to stay up all night with them.

104
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
We could have them over
some Sunday.

105
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, never mind.
Besides, it is Sunday.

106
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Very early Sunday.

107
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,500
- It's ridiculous!
- Well, it's done.

108
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,900
Where are they?
If we've got guests, where are they?

109
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,700
They'll be here soon.

110
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,400
What'd they do, go home
and get some sleep first?

111
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
They'll be here.

112
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,800
I wish you'd tell me...

113
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,100
...about things. Stop springing
things on me all the time.

114
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,300
I don't spring things
on you all the time.

115
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,200
You really do! You're always
springing things on me.

116
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,400
Always.

117
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,000
Poor Georgie Porgie put-upon-pie.

118
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,900
What are you doing? Are you sulking?

119
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,900
Let me see. Are you sulking?

120
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,600
Is that what you're doing?

121
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,600
Never mind.

122
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,900
Just don't bother yourself.

123
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,600
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf,
Virginia Woolf, Virginia Woolf?

124
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,900
What's wrong? Didn't think it's funny?
I thought it was a scream.

125
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,400
It was all right.

126
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,900
You laughed when you heard it
at the party.

127
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,800
I smiled. I didn't laugh.

128
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,400
You laughed your goddamn head off!

129
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,600
It was all right.

130
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,600
It was a scream.

131
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,800
It was very funny, yes.

132
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,200
You make me puke.

133
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,600
You make me puke.

134
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,400
Wasn't a very nice thing to say.

135
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,300
That wasn't what?

136
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,500
A very nice thing to say.

137
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,500
Oh, I like your anger.

138
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,300
I think that's what I like
about you most.

139
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,000
Your anger.

140
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,500
You are such a simp!

141
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,600
You haven't got...

142
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,100
...the what?

143
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Guts?

144
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,000
Phrase-maker.

145
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,700
You never put any ice in my drink.
Why is that?

146
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,700
I always put ice in your drinks.
You eat it, that's all.

147
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,500
It's this habit you've got of chewing
on your ice cubes like a cocker spaniel.

148
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,200
You'll crack your big teeth.

149
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,200
Well, they're my big teeth.

150
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,400
Yeah, some of them, some of them.

151
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
I've got more teeth than you have.

152
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,200
Two more.

153
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,500
And you're going bald.

154
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,400
So are you.

155
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,000
Hello, honey.

156
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,100
Come on and give your mommy
a big sloppy kiss.

157
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,200
I want a big sloppy kiss!

158
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,400
I don't want to kiss you right now.

159
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,700
Where are these people you invited?

160
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,700
Where is this good looking, well-built
young man and his slim-hipped wife?

161
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,900
Talking to Daddy. They'll be here.

162
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,600
Why didn't you want to kiss me?

163
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,700
Why didn't you want to kiss me?

164
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,100
If I kissed you I'd get all excited.
I'd get beside myself...

165
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,800
...and then I'd have to take you by
force on the living room rug.

166
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,600
Then our guests would walk in and
what would your father say about that?

167
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
Oh, you pig!

168
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,400
Fix me another drink, lover.

169
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,500
God, you can swill it down, can't you?

170
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,100
I'm thirsty!

171
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Oh, Jesus!

172
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,800
I can drink you under any table you
want, so don't worry about me.

173
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,800
You got the prize years ago.
You've won every abomination award.

174
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,300
I swear if you existed I'd divorce you.

175
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,800
- Stay on your feet for your guests.
- I can't even see you!

176
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,300
If you pass out or throw up...
And try to keep your clothes on too.

177
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,000
There's no more sickening sight than
you drunk and your skirt over your head.

178
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,300
Your heads, I should say.

179
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,700
Party! Party!

180
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,700
I'm really looking forward to this.

181
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,900
- Go answer the door.
- You answer it.

182
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,300
Get to that door, you!

183
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Come on in!

184
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,500
Get over and answer that door.

185
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,000
All right. Whatever love wants.
Just don't start on the bit, that's all.

186
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,900
The bit?

187
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,500
What language is that?
Imitating one of your students?

188
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,800
Don't start in on the bit
about the kid, that's all.

189
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,500
- What do you take me for?
- Much too much.

190
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,700
I'll start in on the kid if I want to.

191
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,200
I'd advise against it.

192
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,700
Well, good for you.
Get over there and open that door.

193
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,200
You've been advised.

194
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,500
Sure. Get over there.

195
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,700
Yes, love. Whatever love wants.

196
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,200
Some people still have manners...

197
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,200
...and just don't break into
people's houses.

198
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,200
Even if they hear a subhuman monster
yowling at them from inside.

199
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,700
Goddamn you!

200
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,700
You must be our little guests.

201
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,500
Just ignore old sourpuss here.
Come on in, kids!

202
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,900
Just hand your coats to old sourpuss
here.

203
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,700
Perhaps we shouldn't have come.

204
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,600
Yes, it is late!

205
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,700
Late! Are you kidding?
Just throw your stuff down any place.

206
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,900
Furniture, floor.
Makes no difference around here.

207
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,600
I told you we shouldn't have come.

208
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,900
I said come on in. Now come on!

209
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,600
Look, muckmouth, you cut that out!

210
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,900
Martha's a devil with language.

211
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,000
Kids, sit down.

212
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,900
Isn't this lovely?

213
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,000
- Yes, indeed. Very handsome.
- Thank you.

214
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,900
Who did the painting?

215
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,900
Some Greek with a mustache
Martha attacked one night in a...

216
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,000
It's got a...

217
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
- Quiet intensity?
- Well, no...

218
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,000
Then a certain
noisy relaxed quality maybe?

219
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,000
How about a quietly
noisy relaxed intensity?

220
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,000
Dear, you're being joshed.

221
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,800
I'm aware of that.

222
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,100
I am sorry.

223
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,000
It's actually a pictorial representation
of the order of Martha's mind.

224
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,600
Fix the kids a drink.

225
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,700
What would you like to drink?

226
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,500
What would you like?

227
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,700
A little brandy maybe.
Never mix, never worry!

228
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,200
Brandy? Just brandy.
Simple, simple.

229
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,000
What about you...

230
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,400
Bourbon, if you don't mind.

231
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Mind? I don't mind.
Don't think I mind.

232
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,200
Martha, rubbing alcohol for you?

233
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Sure. Never mix, never worry!

234
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,700
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

235
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,000
Wasn't that funny? That was so funny!

236
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,500
Yes, it was.

237
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,900
I thought I'd bust a gut!

238
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,900
George didn't think it was funny.

239
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,700
Martha thinks that unless you
bust a gut you're not amused.

240
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,700
Unless you carry on like a hyena
you're not having fun.

241
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,900
I certainly had fun.
It was a wonderful party!

242
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,200
- It certainly was.
- Your father, he is so wonderful!

243
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,400
He's quite a guy, isn't he?

244
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,100
You better believe it.

245
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,900
He's a marvelous man.

246
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,400
I'm not tearing him down.
We know he's a god.

247
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,100
You lay off my father.

248
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,400
When you've had as many
faculty parties as I have...

249
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,100
I rather appreciated it.

250
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,700
I mean aside from enjoying it,
I appreciated it.

251
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,700
Meeting, introducing, how he had us
stay at the Inn till our place is ready.

252
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,700
When I taught in Kansas...

253
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,400
You won't believe it...

254
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,600
...but we had to make our way all by
ourselves. Isn't that right, dear?

255
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,800
We had to make our own way.

256
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,300
I'd have to go up to the wives
in the library or the supermarket...

257
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,100
...and say, "Hello, I am new here."

258
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,900
"You must be Mrs. So-and-so,
Doctor So-and-so's wife."

259
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,400
It really wasn't very nice at all.

260
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,800
Daddy knows how to run things.

261
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,000
He's a remarkable man.

262
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,600
You bet your sweet life.

263
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,800
I'll tell you a secret.

264
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,000
There are easier things in this world,
if you teach at the university...

265
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
...than being married
to the daughter of...

266
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,300
...the president of that university.
There are easier things.

267
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,600
It's a great opportunity. For some men
it would be the chance of a lifetime.

268
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,300
There are, believe me,
easier things in this world.

269
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,300
Some men would give their right arm
for the chance!

270
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,200
In reality that sacrifice is of a more
private portion of the anatomy.

271
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,200
Could you show me where the...

272
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,500
Are you all right?

273
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,000
Of course, dear. I just want to
put some powder on my nose.

274
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,700
Show her where we keep the euphemism?

275
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm sorry. I want to show you
the house anyway.

276
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,900
We'll be back, dear.

277
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,400
Honestly, George, you burn me up!

278
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You really do!

279
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,400
Don't shoot your mouth off
about you-know-what.

280
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'll talk about
any goddamn thing I want to!

281
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,500
Okay, vanish!

282
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,200
Any goddamn thing I want!

283
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,700
What'll it be?

284
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,400
I'll stick to bourbon.

285
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,100
You're in the Math Department?

286
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,200
No.

287
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,900
Martha said so.
I think that's what she said.

288
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,600
Why'd you decide to be a teacher?

289
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,900
The same things that motivated you,
I imagine.

290
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,600
Oh? What were they?

291
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
What were the things that motivated me?

292
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,100
Well, I'm sure I don't know.

293
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,100
You said the things that motivated you
and me were the same.

294
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,800
I said I imagined they were.

295
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,400
Oh, did you?

296
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,100
You like it here?

297
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,300
Yes, it's fine.

298
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,000
I meant the university.

299
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,900
I know. I meant the university.

300
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,800
Well, I like it fine.

301
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,800
You've been here for quite a long time,
haven't you?

302
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh, yes. Ever since I married
what's-her-name. Martha.

303
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,700
Even before that. Forever.

304
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,000
Dashed hopes and good intentions.

305
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Good, better, best, bested!

306
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,000
How do you like that for a declension?

307
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,900
You didn't answer my question.

308
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,400
Don't condescend. I asked you
how you liked that declension.

309
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,900
I don't know what to say.

310
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,700
You don't know what to say?

311
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,700
Shall I say it's funny,
so you can say it's sad?

312
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,700
Or shall I say it's sad so you can say
it's funny? You can play that game!

313
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,200
- Very good!
- I think we'll just...

314
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,200
Now, calm down. Just calm down.
All right?

315
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,700
Another drink? Here.

316
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,400
I still have one.
And when my wife comes down...

317
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,700
What I mean is, you and your wife
seem to be having some sort of a...

318
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,100
Martha and I are having nothing.
Martha and I are merely exercising.

319
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,600
We're walking what's left of our wits.
Pay no attention.

320
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,900
Now let's sit down and talk, huh?

321
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,400
It's just I don't like to become
involved in other people's affairs.

322
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,600
You'll get over that. Small college.
Musical beds is the faculty sport.

323
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,800
Sir?

324
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,900
Never mind. I wish you wouldn't go
"sir." How old are you?

325
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Twenty-eight.

326
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,900
I'm forty-something.

327
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,400
Aren't you surprised?
Don't I look older?

328
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,300
I think you look fine.

329
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,900
I've always been lean. I play handball.
How much do you weigh?

330
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,300
155,160, something like that?
You play handball?

331
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,500
- Not very well.
- We'll play sometime.

332
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,100
Martha is 108... years old.
She weighs somewhat more than that.

333
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
How old is your wife?

334
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,100
She's twenty-six.

335
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,000
Martha is a remarkable woman.
I imagine she weighs around 110.

336
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,300
Your wife weighs...

337
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,100
No, my boy, your wife.
My wife is Martha.

338
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,100
Yes, I know.

339
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,800
If you were married to Martha
you'd know what it means.

340
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,800
If I were married to your wife,
I'd know what that means.

341
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,100
Martha says you are in
the Math Department or something.

342
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
No, I'm not.

343
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,100
She's seldom mistaken.
Maybe you should be in it.

344
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,600
I'm a biologist.
I'm in the Biology Department.

345
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,800
You're the one's going to make all
that trouble making everyone the same.

346
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,300
Rearranging the chromozones,
or whatever it is, right?

347
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,300
Not exactly. Chromosomes.

348
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm very mistrustful.

349
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,800
You think we learn nothing from history?
I'm in the History Department.

350
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,500
Yes, I know.

351
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,200
Martha tells me I'm in
the History Department...

352
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,000
...as opposed to being the History
Department, in the sense of running it.

353
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,200
I do not run the History Department.

354
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,400
I don't run the Biology Department.

355
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,200
You're twenty-one. Twenty-eight.

356
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,700
Perhaps when you're forty-something
you'll run the History Department.

357
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,900
Biology Department.

358
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,900
I'm really very mistrustful!

359
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,700
I read somewhere that science fiction
is not really fiction at all.

360
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,200
That you rearrange my genes so that
everyone will be like everyone else.

361
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,400
I suspect we shall not have
much music or painting.

362
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,400
But we'll have a civilization of
sublime young men much like yourself.

363
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,900
Cultures and races will vanish.
The ants will take over the world.

364
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,400
Don't know much about science, do you?

365
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,600
I know history.
I know when I'm being threatened.

366
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,900
Your wife doesn't have any hips,
does she?

367
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,200
I'm not hip-happy. I was implying
that your wife is slim-hipped.

368
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,800
Yes, she is.

369
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
You got any kids?

370
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,900
No. Not yet. You?

371
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,700
For me to know and you to find out.

372
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,500
No kids, huh?

373
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,200
What's wrong?

374
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,700
Nothing. We wanted to wait
till we're settled.

375
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,900
Think you'll be happy
here at New Carthage?

376
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,900
Well, we hope to stay here.
I don't mean forever.

377
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,600
Don't bandy that about.
The Old Man wouldn't like it.

378
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,400
Martha's father expects his staff
to come here and grow old...

379
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,200
...and fall in the line of service.

380
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,600
One man, a professor of Latin...

381
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,600
...actually fell in the
cafeteria line one lunch.

382
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,500
But the Old Man isn't falling anywhere.
He isn't going to die.

383
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,600
There are rumors...

384
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,600
...which you can't breathe to Martha
for she foams at the mouth...

385
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,600
...that the Old Man, her father...

386
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,100
...is over two hundred years old.

387
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,800
There's an irony there, but I'm not
drunk enough to figure it out.

388
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Damnit!

389
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,500
I wonder what women talk about
when men talk. I must find out.

390
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,800
What do you want?

391
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,000
Isn't that a wonderful sound?

392
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,200
How many kids you having?

393
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,800
I don't know. My wife is...

394
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,000
Slim-hipped.
Well, there's one of you at least.

395
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,000
You must see this house, dear.
This is such a wonderful old house.

396
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,800
For Christ's sake, hang on a minute!

397
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,800
She'll be right down, she's changing.

398
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
She's changing? What, her clothes?

399
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,800
- Her dress.
- Why?

400
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,800
I imagine that she wants
to be comfortable.

401
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,700
Oh, she does, does she?

402
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,500
You don't know!

403
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,500
- You all right, dear?
- Yes, dear, perfectly fine.

404
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,700
She wants to be comfortable?

405
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,700
Well, we'll see about that!

406
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,000
I didn't know that you had a son.

407
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,200
- A son. I hadn't known.
- You to know and me to find out, huh?

408
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,200
Tomorrow is his birthday.
He will be sixteen.

409
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,700
She told you?

410
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,500
- She told you about him?
- Yes.

411
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,300
You said she's changing?

412
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,200
- And she mentioned...
- Your son's birthday.

413
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600
You look pale. Would you like...

414
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,400
Yes, dear a little more brandy maybe.
Just a drop.

415
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,400
The bar?

416
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,700
Yes, by all means, drink away.
You'll need it as years go on.

417
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,100
Damn destructive...

418
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,900
What time is it, dear?

419
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,400
- 2:30.
- So late!

420
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,900
We should get home.

421
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,900
Keeping the baby sitter up?

422
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,200
I said we didn't have children.

423
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
Sorry, I wasn't even listening.

424
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,200
Or thinking. Whichever applies.

425
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,200
We'll go in a while.

426
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,100
No, you mustn't!

427
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,600
Martha is changing, and not for me.
Martha hasn't changed for me in years.

428
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,900
It means we're going to be here days.
You're being accorded an honor.

429
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,400
Don't forget Martha is the daughter
of our beloved boss... his right arm.

430
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,800
I'd use another word,
but leave that sort of talk to Martha.

431
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,600
What sort of talk?

432
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Well, now!

433
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,200
Why, Martha, your Sunday chapel dress!

434
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,900
Oh, that's most attractive!

435
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,600
You like it? Good.

436
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,600
What do you mean screaming
up the stairs at me?

437
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,900
We got lonely for the soft purr
of your little voice.

438
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,400
Well, you just trot over
to the bar-ie-poo...

439
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,800
...and make your little mommy
a gweat big dwink.

440
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,300
That's right!

441
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,100
You're quite a guy, getting your masters
when you were what, 12?

442
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,400
- Hear that, George?
- 12 and a half, actually.

443
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,300
19, really.

444
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,400
- You needn't have mentioned it.
- I'm proud of you!

445
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,900
- I'm very impressed.
- You're damn right!

446
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm wracked with jealousy.
What do you want me to do, throw up?

447
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,000
That's very impressive.
You should be proud.

448
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
He's a pretty nice fellow.

449
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,100
You might take over
the History Department.

450
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,600
Biology Department.

451
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,000
Yes. I'm preoccupied with history.

452
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,800
What a remark.
"I am preoccupied with history."

453
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,300
George is not. George is preoccupied
with the History Department.

454
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
He's preoccupied with it...

455
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,300
...because he is not the
History Department, he is only in it.

456
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,200
We went through that
while you were upstairs.

457
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,300
That's right, baby, keep it clean.

458
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,000
George is bogged down
in the History Department.

459
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,700
He's an old bog
in the History Department.

460
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,700
That's what George is...

461
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,900
...A bog, a fen, a G.D. Swamp!

462
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,800
Hey, swamp! Hey, swampy!

463
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,000
Can I get you something?

464
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,000
Well, sure.

465
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,200
You can light my cigarette
if you're of a mind to.

466
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,500
No. There are limits.

467
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,900
A man puts up with only so much...

468
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,900
...before he descends on the
evolutionary ladder which is your line.

469
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,500
I'll hold your hand when it's dark
and you're afraid of the bogeyman.

470
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,900
And I'll tote your gin bottles
out after midnight so no one sees.

471
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,500
But I will not light your cigarette.
And that, as they say, is that.

472
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,900
Hey, you played football, huh?

473
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,100
Yes, I was a quarterback.

474
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,700
But I was much more adept at boxing.

475
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,200
Boxing? You hear that, George?

476
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,900
Must've been good. Doesn't look
like you got hit in the face.

477
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,100
He was intercollegiate state
middleweight champion.

478
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,100
Still looks like you have a
pretty good body, is that right?

479
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,700
Decency forbids...

480
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,100
Shut up!

481
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,600
Is that right?
Have you kept your body up?

482
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,600
It's still pretty good. I work out.

483
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,900
Yes, he has a very firm body.

484
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,900
Have you? I think that's very nice.

485
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,900
You know, once you have it,
you never know...

486
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,800
...when it'll come in handy!

487
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,900
I say, why give it up until you have to?

488
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,900
I couldn't agree with you more!

489
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,900
Your obscenity is beyond human...

490
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,100
George here doesn't cotton
too much to body talk.

491
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,300
Paunchy isn't happy when the talk
moves to muscles. How much you weigh?

492
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,600
155,150...

493
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Still at the old middleweight limit?
That's pretty good!

494
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,000
Tell them about the boxing match we had.

495
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,600
Christ!

496
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,600
Tell them about it.

497
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,000
You tell them, you're good at it.

498
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,100
- Is he all right?
- Him? Oh, sure.

499
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,900
We had this boxing match...

500
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,100
...a couple years after we married.

501
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
A boxing match? The two of you?

502
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,600
Yeah, the two of us. Really.

503
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,200
I can't imagine it!

504
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,200
Well, it wasn't in a ring
or anything like that.

505
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,200
Daddy was on this physical fitness kick.

506
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,500
He had a couple of us over one Sunday
and we all went out back...

507
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:50,000
...and Daddy put the gloves on himself
and asked George to box with him.

508
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,800
And George didn't want to.

509
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,600
So Daddy said, "Come on, young man!
What sort of a son-in-law are you?"

510
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,000
And while this was going on,
I don't know why I did it...

511
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,900
...I got into a pair of gloves myself...

512
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,500
...and I snuck up behind George,
just kidding and yelled, "Hey, George!"

513
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,200
And let go with a sort of roundhouse
right. Just kidding, you know.

514
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,600
And George wheeled around real quick
and caught it right in the jaw!

515
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,300
He caught it right in the jaw!

516
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,800
He was off-balance. He must have been.
And then he landed...

517
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,500
...flat in a huckleberry bush!

518
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,500
Pow, you're dead.

519
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,200
Where'd you get that, you bastard?

520
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,200
I've had it awhile. Liked that, did
you?

521
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Bastard!

522
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Oh, that was pretty good.
Hey, give me a kiss.

523
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,100
- Later, sweetie.
- Give me a kiss.

524
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,300
So that's what you're after?
We having blue games for the guests?

525
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,900
Everything in its place.
Everything in it's own good time.

526
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
Drinks now. Drinks for all.

527
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
You've nibbled away at your glass.

528
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,300
I need something.
I was never so frightened in my life.

529
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,200
Weren't you frightened?

530
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,400
- I don't remember.
- I bet you were.

531
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,500
Did you think I was going to kill you?

532
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,300
You? Kill me? That's a laugh!

533
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,800
I might some day.

534
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,500
Fat chance!

535
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,100
Where's the john?

536
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,300
Down the hall and right.

537
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,100
Don't come back with
any guns or anything.

538
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,100
You don't need any props,
do you, baby?

539
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,100
I'll bet not.

540
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,600
- No fake gun for you!
- May I leave my drink here?

541
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,600
Why not? We've got half-filled glasses
wherever Martha left them.

542
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,800
In the closet, the bathtub.
I found one in the freezer.

543
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
- Oh, you did not!
- Yes, I did.

544
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,400
- Brandy gives you no hangover?
- I never mix.

545
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,000
- I don't drink very much either.
- Oh, good.

546
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,500
Your husband was telling us
about chromosomes.

547
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,800
- Chromosomes. He's a biologist.
- He's in the Math Department.

548
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,500
- Biologist.
- He's in the Math Department!

549
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,700
Biology.

550
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,700
Are you sure?

551
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,200
Well, I ought to be sure.

552
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,400
So he's a biologist. Good for him!

553
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,000
Biology's even better.

554
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,700
It's at the meat of things.
You're at the meat of things.

555
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,000
- She thought you were Math Department.
- Maybe I ought to be.

556
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,000
You stay right where you are.
Stay right at the meat of things.

557
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,200
You're obsessed by that phrase.
It's ugly.

558
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,900
You stay right there.

559
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,000
You can take over the History Department
as easy from there as any place else.

560
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,000
Somebody's got to take over
the History Department some day.

561
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,700
And it ain't gonna be Georgie-boy
over there, that's for sure.

562
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,600
Are you swampy, are you?

563
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,400
In my mind you are bedded in cement
up to the neck.

564
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,700
No, up to the nose, it's quieter.

565
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,100
When is your son...

566
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,100
What?

567
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,600
Something about your son.

568
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
When is your son coming home?

569
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,600
When's our son coming home?

570
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,800
Never mind.

571
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,400
I want to know. You brought it up.
When's he coming home?

572
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,100
I said never mind.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

573
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,800
Him up! Not it! You brought him up,
more or less.

574
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,600
When's the little bugger appearing?
Isn't tomorrow his birthday?

575
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,800
I don't want to talk about it.

576
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
I don't want to talk about it!

577
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,100
She doesn't want to talk about it, him.

578
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,200
Martha is sorry she brought it up. Him.

579
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,800
When's the little bugger coming home?

580
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,800
Since you had the bad taste to
bring it up, when is the bugger coming?

581
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,500
George talks disparagingly about
the little bugger...

582
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
...because he has problems.

583
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,200
What problems has the little bugger got?

584
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,100
Not the little bugger.
Stop calling him that!

585
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,300
- You! You've got problems!
- Never heard anything more ridiculous.

586
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,300
Neither have I!

587
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,000
George's biggest problem
about the... about our son...

588
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,200
...about our great big son is that deep
down in the private pit of his gut...

589
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,700
...he is not completely sure that it's
his own kid.

590
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
My God, you're a wicked woman!

591
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,500
And I've told you a million times,
I wouldn't conceive with anyone else.

592
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,700
A deeply wicked person.

593
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,300
I'm not sure this is a subject for...

594
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,300
Martha's lying. I want you
to know that Martha is lying.

595
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,000
There are few things I am certain of,
but the one thing...

596
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,800
...in this sinking world
that I am sure of...

597
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,200
...is my partnership,
my chromosomoligical partnership...

598
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,600
...in the creation of our blond-eyed,
blue-haired son.

599
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm so glad.

600
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,200
- A very pretty speech, George.
- Thank you, Martha.

601
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,800
You rose to the occasion good.
Real good.

602
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,500
Well. Real well!

603
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,600
Martha knows better.

604
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,700
Yes, I've been to college
like everybody else.

605
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,500
George, our son does not
have blue hair.

606
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,200
Or blue eyes for that matter.
He has green eyes like me.

607
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,800
Beautiful, beautiful green eyes.

608
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
He has blue eyes.

609
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,600
Green.

610
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,800
Blue, Martha.

611
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,600
Green, you bastard!

612
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,800
Tut-tut yourself, you old floozy.

613
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,800
He's not a floozie.

614
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,400
He can't be a floozie.
You're a floozie.

615
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,600
Now you just watch yourself!

616
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,400
All right!

617
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,200
I'd like another little nipper
of brandy please.

618
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,400
- I think you've had enough.
- Nonsense!

619
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,300
- We're all ready, I think.
- Nonsense!

620
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
George has watery blue eyes,
kind of milky blue.

621
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,600
Make up your mind.

622
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,500
I gave you the benefit of a doubt.
Daddy has green eyes too.

623
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:55,200
No, he has tiny red eyes, like a white
mouse. In fact, he is a white mouse.

624
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,400
You wouldn't say that if he was here.
You're a coward!

625
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,100
You know that shock of white hair
and these beady red eyes?

626
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,100
A great big white mouse.

627
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,400
George hates Daddy. Not for anything
Daddy's done to him, but for his own...

628
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,900
Inadequacies?

629
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,200
That's right.
You hit it right on the snout!

630
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,400
You know why the S.O.B.
Hates my father?

631
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,100
When George came to the History
Department, about 500 years ago...

632
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,600
...Daddy approved of him.

633
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,100
And you want to know what I did,
dumb cluck that I am?

634
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,300
I fell for him!

635
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,100
I like that!

636
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
She did, you should have seen it.

637
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,100
She'd sit outside my room at night
and howl and claw at the turf.

638
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,200
I couldn't work so I married her.

639
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,400
I actually fell for him.

640
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,800
It! That! There!

641
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,600
Martha's a romantic at heart.

642
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,400
That I am.

643
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,600
I actually fell for him.
And the match seemed practical too.

644
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,300
For a while Daddy thought
George had the stuff...

645
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,800
...to take over when
he was ready to retire.

646
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,000
- Stop it!
- What do you want?!

647
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,200
- I wouldn't go on if I were you.
- You wouldn't? Well, you're not!

648
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,200
You've already sprung a leak
about you-know-what.

649
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,500
What?

650
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,800
About the little bugger. Our son.

651
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,100
If you start in on this, I warn you...

652
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,300
- I stand warned.
- Do we have to go through this?

653
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,000
Anyway, I married the S.O.B.
I had it all planned out.

654
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,500
First he'd take over the History
Department, then the whole college.

655
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,500
That's how it was supposed to be!

656
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
Getting angry?

657
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,300
That was how it was supposed to be.
All very simple.

658
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,500
Daddy thought it was a good idea too.
For a while!

659
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,500
Until he started watching
for a couple of years.

660
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,800
Getting angry?

661
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
Till he watched for a couple years...

662
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,200
...and started thinking
it wasn't such a good idea.

663
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,500
That maybe Georgie-boy
didn't have the stuff!

664
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,700
That he didn't have it in him!

665
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,300
- Stop it, Martha!
- Like hell, I will!

666
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,500
George didn't have much push.
He wasn't aggressive.

667
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,300
In fact, he was sort of a flop!

668
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,200
A great big, fat flop!

669
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,700
I said stop it!

670
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,400
I hope that was an empty bottle.
You can't afford to waste good liquor.

671
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,500
Not on your salary! Not on
an associate professor's salary!

672
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,500
So here I am, stuck with this flop...

673
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,200
...this bog in the History Department.

674
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,000
Who's married
to the president's daughter...

675
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,400
...who's expected to be somebody.
Not just a nobody!

676
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,400
A bookworm who's so
goddamn complacent...

677
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,000
...he can't make anything
out of himself.

678
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,700
That doesn't have the guts
to make anybody proud of him!

679
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,400
All right, George, stop it!

680
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,400
I'm going to be sick!

681
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,600
She'll be all right.
I'll make some coffee.

682
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,100
- You sure?
- She'll be okay.

683
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,600
I'm really very sorry.

684
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,100
She really shouldn't drink.
She's frail.

685
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,100
Slim-hipped, as you say.

686
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,900
Where's my little yum-yum?
Where's Martha?

687
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,600
I think she's going to make some coffee.

688
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,700
She gets sick quite easily.

689
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,300
Martha? No, she hasn't been
sick a day in her life.

690
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,900
Unless you count time
she spends in the rest home.

691
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,800
No, no. My wife.

692
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,300
My wife gets sick quite easily.
Your wife is Martha.

693
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,600
I know.

694
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,800
She doesn't really spend any time
in a rest home?

695
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,300
Your wife?

696
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,900
No, yours.

697
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,100
Mine?

698
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,100
She doesn't. I would.

699
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,500
If I were her... she... I would.

700
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,100
But then I'm not and so I don't.

701
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,300
I'd like to, though.

702
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,800
It gets pretty bouncy
around here sometimes.

703
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,500
Yes, I'm sure.

704
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,400
- Your wife throws up a lot?
- I didn't say that.

705
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,000
I said she gets sick quite easily.

706
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,800
By sick I thought that you meant she...

707
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,300
It's true, actually.
She does throw up a lot.

708
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,700
The word is often.

709
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,800
Once she starts
there's practically no stopping.

710
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,900
She'll go right on for hours.

711
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,600
Not all the time.

712
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,800
Regularly.

713
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,900
- You can tell time by her?
- Just about.

714
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,700
I married her because she was pregnant.

715
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,000
But you said you didn't have
any children.

716
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,700
She wasn't really. It was a...

717
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,200
...hysterical pregnancy.

718
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,500
She blew up and then she went down.

719
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,300
And when she was up you married her?

720
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,800
Then she went down.

721
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,500
When I was 16...

722
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,400
...and going to prep school,
during the Punic Wars...

723
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,900
...a bunch of us would go to town
the first day of vacation...

724
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,200
...before we fanned out to our homes.

725
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,800
And in the evening
we would go to a gin mill...

726
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,700
...owned by the gangster-father
of one of us...

727
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:12,100
...and we would drink with the grown-ups
and listen to the jazz.

728
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,700
And one time, in the bunch of us...

729
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,600
...there was this...

730
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,800
...boy who was 15...

731
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,700
...and he had killed his mother
with a shotgun some years before.

732
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,100
Completely accidentally...

733
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,100
...without even an unconscious
motivation, I have no doubt at all.

734
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,800
And this one time this boy
went with us and...

735
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,800
...we ordered our drinks...

736
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,000
...and when it came his turn he said...

737
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,600
"I'll have bergin.

738
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:51,800
"Give me some bergin please.
Bergin and water."

739
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,400
We all laughed.

740
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,400
He was blond and he had the face
of a cherub, and we all laughed.

741
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,100
And his cheeks went red
and the color rose in his neck.

742
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:12,500
The waiter told people at the next table
what the boy said and they laughed...

743
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,500
...and then more people were told
and the laughter grew and grew.

744
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,400
No one was laughing more than us...

745
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,600
...and none of us more than the boy
who had shot his mother.

746
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,200
And soon everyone in the gin mill
knew what the laughter was about...

747
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:41,200
...and everyone started ordering bergin
and laughing when they ordered it.

748
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,400
And soon, of course,
the laughter became less general...

749
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:50,100
...but it did not subside entirely
for a very long time.

750
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,400
For always at this table or that...

751
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,900
...someone would order bergin...

752
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,800
...and a whole new area
of laughter would rise.

753
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,100
We drank free that night.

754
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,600
We were bought champagne
by the management...

755
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,100
...by the gangster-father of one of us.

756
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,900
And, of course,
we suffered the next day...

757
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,600
...each of us alone,
on his train away from the city...

758
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:27,100
...and each of us
with a grown-up's hangover.

759
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,700
But it was the grandest day...

760
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,500
...of my...

761
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,300
...youth.

762
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,800
What happened to the boy?

763
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,300
The boy who had shot his mother.

764
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,100
I won't tell you.

765
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,000
The next summer on a country road,
with his learner's permit...

766
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,900
...and his father sitting to his right,
he swerved to avoid a porcupine...

767
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,800
...and drove straight into a large tree.

768
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,700
He was not killed, of course.

769
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:23,300
In the hospital when he was conscious
and out of danger...

770
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,200
...when they told him
his father was dead...

771
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,800
...he began to laugh, I have been told.

772
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,900
And his laughter grew
and would not stop.

773
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,500
And it was not until after
they'd jammed a needle in his arm...

774
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:46,200
...not until his consciousness
had slipped away from him...

775
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,200
...that his laughter subsided. Stopped.

776
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,700
When he recovered
from his injuries enough...

777
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:59,700
...so he could be moved without damage
should he struggle...

778
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,100
...he was put in an asylum.

779
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,100
That was thirty years ago.

780
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,400
Is he still there?

781
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,500
Oh, yes.

782
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,100
I'm told that for these thirty years...

783
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,700
...he has not uttered...

784
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,100
...one sound.

785
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,600
That's Big Martha.

786
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,900
She's making coffee.

787
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,900
For your hysterical wife,
who goes up and down.

788
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,800
Went.

789
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,800
Up and down.

790
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,300
Went? And no more?

791
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,400
No more. Nothing.

792
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,700
Martha doesn't have
hysterical pregnancies.

793
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,400
My wife had one.

794
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,100
Martha doesn't have pregnancies at all.

795
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,300
Do you have any other kids,
any daughters or anything?

796
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,600
Do we have any what?

797
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,100
I mean, do you only have
the one...

798
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,500
...kid, your son?

799
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,100
No, just one.

800
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,100
One boy.

801
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,900
Our son.

802
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,400
That's nice.

803
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
He's a comfort.

804
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,200
He's a beanbag.

805
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,300
A what?

806
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,300
A beanbag. You wouldn't understand.

807
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,400
A beanbag!

808
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,100
I heard! I didn't say I was deaf,
I said I didn't understand!

809
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,200
- You didn't say that at all.
- I was implying I didn't understand.

810
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,700
- You're getting testy.
- I'm sorry!

811
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:27,200
I just said our son, the apple of
our 3 eyes, Martha being a Cyclops...

812
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,900
...our son is a beanbag,
and you get testy.

813
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,500
It's late, I'm tired.
I've been drinking since 9 o'clock.

814
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,100
My wife is vomiting.
There's been a lot of screaming here.

815
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,600
You get testy, naturally.
Don't worry about it.

816
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,000
Anybody coming here gets testy.
Don't be upset.

817
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,400
- I'm not upset.
- You're testy.

818
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,900
I'd like to set you straight
about something while we're out here.

819
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,900
About something Martha said.

820
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,200
Hark! Forest sounds.

821
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,600
Animal noises.

822
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,100
Oh, well, here's nursie!

823
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,400
We're sitting up, we're having coffee.

824
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,100
Is there anything I should do?

825
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,700
No, you just stay there
and listen to Georgie's side of things.

826
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,900
Bore yourself to death!

827
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,700
You clean up the mess you made in here?

828
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,100
No, Martha, I did not
clean up the mess I made.

829
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,300
I've been trying for years
to clean up the mess I made.

830
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,300
Have you been trying for years?

831
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,600
Accommodation, adjustment...

832
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,600
...those do seem to be
in the order of things.

833
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,600
Don't put me in the same class with you.

834
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,400
No, of course not.
I mean things are simpler for you.

835
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,100
You marry a woman
because she's all blown up.

836
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:54,100
- Where I, in my old-fashioned way...
- There was more to it than that.

837
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,200
Sure. I bet she has money too.

838
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,300
Yes.

839
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,100
You mean I was right? I hit it?

840
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,700
My God, what archery! First try, too.
How about that?

841
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,300
- There were other things.
- Yes.

842
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,100
To compensate.

843
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,800
There always are.

844
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,200
Allow me.

845
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Tell me about your wife's money.

846
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,100
No.

847
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,100
Okay, don't.

848
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,900
My father-in-law was a man of the Lord.

849
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,600
And he was very rich.

850
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,100
What faith?

851
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,000
My father-in-law...

852
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,300
...was called by God
when he was six or something.

853
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,800
He started preaching, baptized people,
and he saved them and then...

854
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,700
...he traveled around a lot and
became pretty famous. Not like...

855
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,800
...some of them but...

856
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,300
...pretty famous.

857
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,700
When he died he had a lot of money.

858
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,300
- God's money?
- No, his own.

859
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,000
- What about God's money?
- He spent it and he saved his own.

860
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,200
I think that's very nice.

861
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Martha has money because...

862
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,400
...Martha's father's second wife...

863
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,500
...not Martha's mother,
but after her mother died...

864
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,100
...was a very old lady...

865
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,300
...who had warts, who was very rich.

866
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,300
She was a witch!

867
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
She was a good witch,
and she married the white mouse...

868
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,500
...with the red eyes,
and he must have...

869
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,500
...nibbled her warts
or something...

870
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:04,100
...because she went up in a
puff of smoke almost immediately.

871
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,600
And all that was left,
apart from some wart medicine...

872
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,200
...was a big, fat will.

873
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,300
Maybe my father-in-law...

874
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,800
...and the witch with the warts
should have gotten together.

875
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,100
Because he was a mouse too.

876
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,700
- He was?
- Sure!

877
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,300
He was a church mouse!

878
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,200
Your wife never mentioned a stepmother.

879
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,700
Maybe it isn't true.

880
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,100
You realize I've been
drawing you out on this stuff...

881
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,500
...because you're a threat to me
and I want to get the goods on you.

882
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:08,700
Sure.

883
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I've warned you. You stand warned.

884
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,800
I stand warned.

885
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,300
You sneaky types
worry me the most, you know.

886
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,400
You ineffectual sons of bitches,
you're the worst.

887
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,600
I'm glad you don't believe me.
You've got history on your side.

888
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,500
You've got history on your side.
I've got biology on mine.

889
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
History, biology.

890
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,300
- I know the difference.
- You don't act it.

891
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,800
We decided you'd take over the History
Department first, then the whole works.

892
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,800
A step at a time.

893
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:49,200
What I thought I'd do is sort of
insinuate myself generally. You know!

894
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,200
Find all the weak spots.

895
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,600
Like me.

896
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:58,300
Become sort of a fact
and then turn into a...

897
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,100
A what?

898
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,200
- An inevitability?
- Exactly!

899
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,300
An inevitability.

900
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,600
Take over a few courses
from the older men.

901
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,300
Plow a few pertinent wives.

902
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,600
Now that's it!

903
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,000
You can shove aside
all the older men...

904
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,500
...but until you're plowing pertinent
wives you're not working.

905
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,800
That's the way to power. Plow 'em all!

906
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,300
The way to a man's heart...

907
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,600
...the wide, inviting avenue to his job
is through his wife...

908
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,200
...and don't you forget it.

909
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,700
I bet your wife's got the most inviting
avenue on the whole campus!

910
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,100
I mean, her father
being president and all.

911
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,700
You bet your historical inevitability.

912
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,500
I just better get her off
into the bushes right away.

913
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,200
You'd certainly better.

914
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,800
I almost think you're serious.

915
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,800
No, you almost think you're serious.
And it scares you.

916
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,000
Me?

917
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,400
Yes, you.

918
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,700
You're kidding!

919
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:12,700
I wish I were. I'll give you some
good advice if you want me to.

920
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,500
Good advice? From you?

921
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,500
You haven't learned yet. Take it
wherever you can get it. Listen.

922
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,900
I'm giving you good advice now.

923
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,000
There's quicksand here and you'll be
dragged down before you know it.

924
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,500
Sucked down!

925
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,100
You disgust me on principle and you're
a smug son of a bitch...

926
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:38,200
...but I'm trying to give you
a survival kit. Do you hear me?

927
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,200
I hear you. You come in loud.

928
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,400
You want to play it by ear, right?

929
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,400
Everything will work out anyway,
because the timetable's history, right?

930
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,700
Right. Just tend to your knitting,
grandma. I'll be okay.

931
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,400
I've tried to...

932
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,900
...tried to reach you, to...

933
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,200
Make contact?

934
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,400
Communicate?

935
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,700
Yes, exactly.

936
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:03,600
Aw, that's touching. That's downright
moving, that's what that is.

937
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,100
Up yours!

938
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,100
- What?
- You heard me.

939
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,100
You take the trouble
to construct a civilization...

940
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,100
...to build a society based on
the principles of... principle.

941
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:27,900
You make government and art and realize
they are, must be, the same.

942
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:32,800
You bring things to the saddest point,
where there is something to lose.

943
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,800
Then, all at once,
through all the music...

944
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,400
...through the sensible sounds
of building...

945
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,000
...attempting, comes the Dies Irae.

946
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,000
And what is it?
What does the trumpet sound?

947
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,000
Up yours!

948
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,800
Here we are.
A little shaky, but on our feet.

949
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
It wasn't too bad, dear, really.

950
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,000
- I'm not cold.
- Just put it on, we're leaving.

951
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,100
- You're what?
- We're going home.

952
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,000
What's been going on here?

953
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,200
- What have you been up to?
- I'll get the car.

954
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,600
I'll call a cab.

955
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,500
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

956
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:16,200
Now let me see.
I think what I'm doing is...

957
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,700
...I'm getting the car to take
our little guests home.

958
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,000
Aren't you going to apologize?

959
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,800
The road should've been straight.

960
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,200
Not that. For making her throw up.

961
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,000
- I did not make her throw up.
- You certainly did.

962
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:44,200
Who do you think did, sexy there?
He made his own wife sick?

963
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,800
- You make me sick.
- That's different.

964
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,000
Please! I throw up.

965
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,200
I get sick occasionally all by myself,
without reason.

966
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,000
- Is that a fact?
- You're delicate, honey.

967
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,500
I've always done it.

968
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,000
Like Big Ben?

969
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,400
Watch it.

970
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,800
George makes everybody sick.
When our son was a little boy...

971
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,900
...he threw up all the time
because of George.

972
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,900
It got so whenever George came into
a room, he'd start right in retching.

973
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,900
Our son used to throw up all the time...

974
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,000
...because you were always
fiddling at him.

975
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,000
Into his bedroom,
kimono flying, fiddling...

976
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,400
I suppose that's why he ran away
twice in one month.

977
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,600
Twice in one month!
Six times in one year...

978
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:29,400
Our son ran away from home
because Martha used to corner him.

979
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,900
I never cornered
the son of a bitch in my life!

980
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:37,200
He'd run to me when I got home
and say, "Mama's always coming at me."

981
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,700
Liar!

982
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,800
Always coming at him.
Very embarrassing!

983
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,900
If it was so embarrassing,
why are you talking about it?

984
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,400
I didn't want to talk about it at all.

985
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:51,600
I wish I had some brandy.
I love brandy, I really do.

986
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,500
- Good for you.
- It steadies me.

987
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,400
I used to drink brandy.

988
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,800
You used to drink bergin, too.

989
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,100
Shut up, Martha!

990
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,800
- What?
- Nothing.

991
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:10,400
Did he tell you about that?
Come on, he must have said something.

992
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,300
Actually what we did is
we sort of danced around a little.

993
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,900
I love dancing. I really do.

994
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:17,900
He didn't mean that.

995
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:22,100
Well, I didn't think that he did!
Two grown men dancing!

996
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:27,500
He didn't tell how he tried to publish
a book and Daddy wouldn't let him?

997
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,500
- A book? What book?
- Just a book.

998
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,100
Just a book!

999
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,900
Oh, look, dancing!

1000
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,300
Why don't we dance?
I'd love some dancing.

1001
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,600
- We're almost home.
- I want some dancing!

1002
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,600
- That's not such a bad idea.
- Don't you love dancing?

1003
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,100
- With the right man, yeah.
- I dance like the wind.

1004
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,100
Stop the car. We're going dancing!

1005
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,100
- For heaven's sake!
- Did you hear me?

1006
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,100
Whatever love wants.

1007
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,700
I dance like the wind!

1008
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,800
Put one on, will you?

1009
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,300
How are we going to work this,
mixed doubles?

1010
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,800
You don't think I'm going
to dance with you?

1011
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,800
Not with him around.
And not with twinkle-toes either.

1012
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,900
I'll dance with anyone!
I'll dance with myself!

1013
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:24,500
- Honey, you'll get sick again.
- I dance like the wind!

1014
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,700
All right, kiddies, choose up
and hit the sack.

1015
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,500
All right, George, cut that out!

1016
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,200
Cut it out, George!

1017
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:43,700
What, Martha?

1018
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,200
All right, you son of a bitch!

1019
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,200
- What'd you say, love?
- It stopped!

1020
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,800
Why did it stop?

1021
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,400
I said give me some change.

1022
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,600
Stop that!

1023
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:02,200
You are always at me
when I'm having a good time!

1024
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,700
Just leave me alone. I like to dance
and you don't want me to.

1025
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,100
Just leave me alone!

1026
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,600
Choose it. Do your stuff.

1027
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,600
You're damned right.

1028
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,400
Hi, sexy!

1029
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,500
You want to dance, angel boobs?

1030
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,200
What'd you call my wife?

1031
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,500
No, if I can't do my interpretive dance,
I don't want to dance at all.

1032
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,400
I'll just sit here.

1033
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,600
Okay, stuff, let's go.

1034
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,600
- We'll just sit here and watch.
- That's right.

1035
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,600
You are strong, aren't you?

1036
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,400
I like that.

1037
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,500
They dance like they've danced before.

1038
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,700
A familiar dance, monkey nipples,
they know it.

1039
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,600
I don't know what you mean.

1040
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,300
- I like the way you move.
- I like the way you move too.

1041
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,700
- They like the way they move.
- That's nice.

1042
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,700
I'm surprised George didn't tell you
his side of things.

1043
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,300
- Well, he didn't.
- That surprises me.

1044
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,300
- Does it?
- Aren't they cute?

1045
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,100
He usually does when he can.

1046
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,900
I don't think he trusts me.

1047
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:32,500
It's really a very sad story.

1048
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,300
It would make you weep.

1049
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,700
You have ugly talents, Martha.

1050
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,400
Is that so?

1051
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,600
Don't encourage her.

1052
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:44,300
Encourage me.

1053
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,200
I warned you, don't encourage her!

1054
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,700
He warned you.

1055
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:52,000
- Don't encourage me.
- I heard him. Tell me more.

1056
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,700
Georgie-boy had lots of big ambitions...

1057
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,600
...in spite of something funny
in his past...

1058
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,800
...which Georgie-boy here
turned into a novel.

1059
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,600
His first attempt and also his last!

1060
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,600
I rhymed!

1061
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,800
I warn you!

1062
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:20,500
But Daddy took a look
at Georgie's novel.

1063
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,700
You're looking for a punch in the mouth.

1064
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,000
Do tell!

1065
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,900
And he was very shocked by what he read.

1066
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,000
- He was?
- Yes, he was.

1067
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,300
A novel all about a naughty boy-child.

1068
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,800
I will not tolerate this!

1069
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,200
Oh, can it!

1070
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,200
A naughty boy-child...

1071
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,000
...who killed his mother...

1072
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,500
...and his father dead!

1073
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:46,700
Stop it!

1074
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,000
And Daddy said, "Look here...

1075
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,800
"...I will not let you
publish such a thing!"

1076
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,400
The dancing's over!

1077
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,100
Violence!

1078
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,500
And Daddy said...

1079
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:04,400
..."You don't think I'm going to
let you publish this kind of crap?"

1080
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,400
"Not on your life,
not while you're teaching here."

1081
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:11,200
"You publish that
and you're out on your ass!"

1082
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,200
Desist! Desist!

1083
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,900
I will not be made mock of.

1084
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,200
He will not be made mock of,
for cripes sake!

1085
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,700
The game is over!

1086
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,600
Just imagine...

1087
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:27,000
...a book all about a boy who murders
his mother and kills his father...

1088
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,000
...and pretends it's all an accident.

1089
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,300
Hey, wait a minute!

1090
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,600
You want to know the clincher?

1091
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:37,900
You want to know what
big brave Georgie said to Daddy?

1092
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,800
But Daddy...

1093
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,800
I mean, "But, Sir, this isn't
a novel at all."

1094
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,100
You will not say this!

1095
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,600
The hell, I won't! Keep away!

1096
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,900
"No, sir, this is no novel at all."

1097
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,500
"This is the truth.
This really happened to me!"

1098
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:58,100
- I'll kill you.
- It happened!

1099
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:02,700
Violence!

1100
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,800
Very quiet now.

1101
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,100
We'll all be...

1102
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,800
...very quiet.

1103
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,000
Murderer!

1104
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,300
What's the trouble in here?

1105
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,800
Nothing. No trouble,
just playing a game.

1106
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,200
Well, we're closing.

1107
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,700
One more round.

1108
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,100
Same for everybody.

1109
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:40,000
Give us one more round
and we'll be on our merry way.

1110
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,300
All right? Good!

1111
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,500
Thanks.

1112
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,200
Well, that's one game.
What shall we do now?

1113
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:58,000
Let's do something else. We played
Humiliate the Host, what'll we do now?

1114
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,800
Oh, look!

1115
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,700
We must know other games,
us college types.

1116
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,800
- Can't be the limit of our vocabulary.
- Haven't had enough?

1117
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,400
There are other games.

1118
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,200
How about...

1119
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,500
How about Hump the Hostess?

1120
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,400
Want to play that one? Do you want
to play Hump the Hostess?

1121
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,500
Or do you want to wait till later,
off in the bushes?

1122
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,800
Hump the Hostess!

1123
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Will you shut up?

1124
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:43,100
You want to save that for later.
What shall we play now?

1125
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,600
- Portrait of a Man Drowning.
- I'm not drowning.

1126
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,500
- You told me to shut up.
- I'm sorry.

1127
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:50,500
I'm sorry!

1128
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,600
I know what we do.

1129
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,900
Now that we've done this round
of Humiliate the Host...

1130
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,400
...and don't want to play
Hump the Hostess yet.

1131
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:02,900
I know what! How about a little round
of Get the Guests?

1132
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,400
How about that? Get the Guests?

1133
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,100
Book dropper, child mentioner!

1134
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,200
I don't like these games.

1135
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,800
We've only had one game, we've got to
have another. You can't fly on one.

1136
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,000
Silence!

1137
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,500
How will we play Get the Guests?

1138
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,800
You be quiet!

1139
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,800
I wonder.

1140
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:30,100
Martha, in her indiscreet way,
told you all about my first novel.

1141
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,400
True or false that there
was such a thing.

1142
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,800
She told you about my first novel,
my memory book.

1143
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,400
I preferred she hadn't, but
that's blood under the bridge.

1144
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,300
But what Martha didn't tell you...

1145
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,600
...what Martha didn't tell at all about
was my second novel.

1146
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:48,100
You didn't know about that, did you?
True or false?

1147
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,500
Well, it's an allegory really, probably.

1148
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,100
It's about a nice young couple
who comes out of the Middle West.

1149
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,000
It's a bucolic, you see.

1150
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:01,000
This nice young couple
comes out of the Middle West.

1151
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,100
He's blond and he's about thirty.

1152
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:07,000
And he's a scientist,
a teacher, a scientist.

1153
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:11,400
- His mouse, wifey, gargles brandy...
- Just a minute here!

1154
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,900
This is my game!
You've had your game!

1155
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,800
I want to hear. I love stories.

1156
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Mousie's father was a holy man, see?

1157
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:22,300
He ran a traveling clip joint and he
took the faithful, just took them.

1158
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,000
- This is familiar.
- No kidding.

1159
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:28,800
Anyway, Blondie and his frau
out of the Plains States came.

1160
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,200
Very funny, George.

1161
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:32,500
Thank you.

1162
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:35,000
They settled in a town
like Nouveau Carthage.

1163
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,000
- I don't think you should go on.
- Do you not?

1164
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,000
I love familiar stories.
They're the best.

1165
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:42,700
How right you are! But Blondie
was all in disguise as a teacher...

1166
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,300
...because his baggage ticket had
bigger things writ on it. H.I.!

1167
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,300
Historical Inevitability.

1168
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:52,300
- There's no reason to go further.
- Let them go on.

1169
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
He had this baggage, and part of his
baggage was in the form of his mouse.

1170
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,600
We don't have to listen.

1171
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,400
- Why not?
- She has a point.

1172
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,400
Nobody could figure out
Blondie's baggage, his mouse.

1173
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:07,400
I mean, here he was pan-Kansas
swimming champion or something...

1174
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:08,900
...and he had this mouse.

1175
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,900
Of whom he was solicitous to a point
that faileth human understanding...

1176
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,400
...given that she was
something of a simp.

1177
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,000
This just isn't fair of you.

1178
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,300
Perhaps not. His mouse
tooted brandy immodestly...

1179
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,000
...and spent half her time
in the upchuck.

1180
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,700
- I know these people.
- Do you?

1181
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,200
But she was money baggage
among other things.

1182
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,200
Godly money from the golden teeth of the
unfaithful and she was put up with!

1183
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,500
- I don't like this story.
- And she was put up with!

1184
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:36,700
Stop? Hah!

1185
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:39,400
- Please, please, don't.
- Beg, baby!

1186
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,400
- Flashback to "How they got married."
- No!

1187
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:46,200
- Why?
- How they got married was this.

1188
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,900
The mouse got all puffed up one day...

1189
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:53,600
...and she went over to Blondie's house
and stuck out her puff...

1190
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,200
...and she said, "Look at me."

1191
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,600
I don't like this.

1192
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:01,300
"Look at me, I'm all puffed up."
"Oh, my goodness," said Blondie.

1193
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,400
And so they were married.

1194
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,300
And then what?

1195
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,300
And then the puff went away again
like magic. Poof!

1196
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:14,300
The puff went away?

1197
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,300
Honey, I didn't mean to. Honestly.

1198
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,200
You shouldn't have told them!

1199
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,400
No! You couldn't have told them!

1200
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,700
And that's how you play Get the Guests.

1201
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,300
Oh, please! I'm going to be sick!

1202
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:45,600
You shouldn't have done that.

1203
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,500
- I hate hypocrisy.
- That was cruel and vicious.

1204
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,600
She'll get over it. She'll recover.

1205
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,400
- And damaging to me.
- To you!

1206
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,400
To me!

1207
01:19:56,300 --> 01:20:00,900
Beautiful. You got to have a swine
to show you where the truffles are.

1208
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,700
Rearrange your alliances.
Make the best of things.

1209
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,500
Put your wife in the car.

1210
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,200
I've had enough rides tonight.
We'll walk.

1211
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,500
Right, you go plan some new strategy.

1212
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:14,800
You'll regret this.

1213
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,600
No doubt. I regret everything.

1214
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
No, I mean I'll make you regret this.

1215
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,000
Clean up the mess.

1216
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,500
You just wait.

1217
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,000
- Very good, George.
- Thank you.

1218
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,500
- Really good!
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1219
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:32,300
I mean, you did a good job.
You really fixed it.

1220
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,400
That's the most life you've shown
in a long time.

1221
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,100
You bring out the best in me.

1222
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:43,900
You really are a bastard!

1223
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,700
You can go around like
a hopped-up Arab...

1224
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,700
...slashing at everything,
scarring up half the world...

1225
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,700
...but let somebody else try it?
Oh no!

1226
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:58,100
Why, baby, I did it all for you!
I thought you'd like it, sweetheart.

1227
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:01,400
It's to your taste,
blood, carnage and all.

1228
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,100
I thought you'd sort of get excited.

1229
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,800
Heave and pant and come running at me,
your melons bobbling...

1230
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,400
You have really screwed up, George.

1231
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,800
I mean it! You really have!

1232
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,800
You can sit,
gin running from your mouth...

1233
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:20,100
...you can humiliate me, tear me to
pieces all night, it's perfectly okay.

1234
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,600
You can stand it!

1235
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:22,900
I cannot stand it!

1236
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,100
You can stand it!
You married me for it!

1237
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,900
That's a desperately sick lie.

1238
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,300
Don't you know it even yet?

1239
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,000
My arm's gotten tired whipping you.

1240
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,500
- Year after year!
- Deluded, Martha.

1241
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,800
It's not what I wanted.

1242
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,800
I thought at least you were onto
yourself. I didn't know.

1243
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,800
No. You're sick!

1244
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,300
I'll show you who's sick!

1245
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,800
You really are having
a field day, aren't you?

1246
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,800
Well, I'm gonna finish you
before I'm through with you.

1247
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:20,300
You and that quarterback?
You both going to finish me?

1248
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:24,800
Before I'm through with you you'll
wish you'd died in that automobile!

1249
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,500
You'll wish you'd never mentioned
our son.

1250
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,600
I warned you.

1251
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,200
- I'm impressed!
- I warned you not to go too far!

1252
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,600
I'm just beginning!

1253
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,300
I'm numbed so I can take you
when we're alone. I don't listen.

1254
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,500
And if I do listen I sift it so I don't
really hear, which is the only way.

1255
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,400
But you've taken a new tack
in the last century...

1256
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:50,000
...which is just too much. Too much!

1257
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:56,000
I don't mind your dirty underthings in
public. I do, but I'm reconciled to it.

1258
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,700
You've moved into your own
fantasy world! You don't know...

1259
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,900
- You have!
- Nuts!

1260
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,400
You can go on...

1261
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:08,000
Have you ever listened to your
sentences? You're so convoluted.

1262
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,000
You talk like one of your stupid papers.

1263
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,500
Actually, I'm rather worried about you.
About your mind.

1264
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:17,400
Don't you worry
about my mind, sweetheart!

1265
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:18,700
I'll commit you.

1266
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,200
You what?

1267
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,600
I think I'll have you committed.

1268
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,600
Baby, aren't you something?

1269
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,100
I've got to find a way to get at you.

1270
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,900
You've got at me, you don't have to
do anything, George.

1271
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,900
A thousand years of you
has been enough!

1272
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,200
You'll go quietly then?

1273
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:44,200
Do you want to know what's
really happened?

1274
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:49,100
It snapped! Finally. Not me, it!
The whole arrangement.

1275
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,900
You can go on forever and ever,
everything is manageable.

1276
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:57,100
You make all sorts of excuses:
"To hell with it, this is life."

1277
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,600
"Maybe tomorrow he'll be dead.
Maybe tomorrow you'll be dead."

1278
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:01,600
All sorts of excuses.

1279
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,200
Then one day...

1280
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,000
...one night, something happens...

1281
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,700
...and snap!

1282
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:12,300
It breaks and you just don't
give a damn anymore!

1283
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,300
I tried with you, baby. I really tried.

1284
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,300
Come off it.

1285
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,900
You're a monster. You are.

1286
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,100
I'm loud, and I'm vulgar...

1287
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,600
...and I wear the pants in the house
because somebody's got to!

1288
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,600
But I am not a monster!

1289
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,600
I'm not!

1290
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,900
You're a spoiled, self-indulgent,
dirty-minded, liquor-riddled...

1291
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,300
Snap! It went snap.

1292
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,500
I won't try to get through
to you any more.

1293
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,600
There was a second back there,
when I could've...

1294
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,300
...gotten through to you.

1295
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:56,300
When maybe we could've out
through all this crap!

1296
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:01,200
But it's past.
And I'm not going to try.

1297
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:04,300
Once a month, Martha.
I've gotten used to it.

1298
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:09,600
We get Misunderstood Martha, the
good-hearted girl beneath the barnacles.

1299
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:13,200
The little miss that a touch of kindness
will bring to bloom again.

1300
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:18,000
I believed it more times than I'd admit.
I'm that much of a sucker.

1301
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,300
But I don't believe you,
I just don't believe you!

1302
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:25,500
There is no moment any more
when we could come together.

1303
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,500
You can't come together with nothing.
And you're nothing!

1304
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Snap!

1305
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,400
I looked at you tonight
and you weren't there!

1306
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:41,200
It finally snapped.
And I'm gonna howl it out!

1307
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,200
I won't give a damn what I do.

1308
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:47,000
And I'll make the biggest goddamn
explosion you've ever heard!

1309
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,500
And I'll beat you at your own game.

1310
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,700
- Is that a threat, George?
- That's a threat, Martha.

1311
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,200
You're going to get it, baby!

1312
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,700
Be careful, I'll rip you to pieces.

1313
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:00,200
You are not man enough.
You haven't the guts!

1314
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:02,700
Total war?

1315
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,800
Total!

1316
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:16,600
Bells.

1317
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:23,600
I've been hearing bells!

1318
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:26,400
Bells ringing.

1319
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,400
And I couldn't sleep for the bells.

1320
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,000
That woke me up.

1321
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,600
What time is it?

1322
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:48,800
Don't bother me.

1323
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:53,900
I was asleep.

1324
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:57,800
And I was dreaming of something...

1325
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,600
...and I heard the sounds coming...

1326
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,200
...and I didn't know what it was...

1327
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,100
...and it frightened me.

1328
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,600
I'm going to get you, Martha.

1329
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,100
Somehow, Martha.

1330
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:16,400
And there was someone there and...
I didn't want someone there.

1331
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:18,600
I was naked.

1332
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,800
You don't know what's going on, do you?

1333
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,500
I don't want to know.

1334
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,000
Listen to them!

1335
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,300
- I don't want to!
- Look at them!

1336
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,600
I don't want any children.

1337
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,800
I don't want any children, please!

1338
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,300
I'm afraid. I don't want to be hurt.

1339
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,500
I should have known.

1340
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,100
Does that stud you married
know about that?

1341
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:54,300
How do you make your
secret little murders? Pills?

1342
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,700
You got a secret supply of pills?
Apple jelly? Willpower?

1343
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:58,900
Going to throw up?

1344
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:01,200
Where is he? I want my husband!
I want a drink!

1345
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,500
That's right, go at it!

1346
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:06,500
You know what's going on there?

1347
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:12,500
I don't want to know anything.
You leave me alone.

1348
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,400
Who rang?

1349
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,800
What were the bells? Who rang?

1350
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,000
He's up there and you ask who rang?

1351
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,600
Someone rang!

1352
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:27,300
Someone rang.

1353
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,400
The bells rang and it was someone...

1354
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:33,700
Somebody.

1355
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,000
Somebody rang.
The bells rang and it was somebody...

1356
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,200
I've got it!

1357
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,900
I've got it, Martha!

1358
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:50,000
It was a message. The message was...

1359
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,500
...our son... it was a message...
The bells rang...

1360
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,900
...and it was a message.
And it was about...

1361
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,000
...our son...

1362
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,900
And the message was...

1363
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,200
...our son...

1364
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,700
...is dead!

1365
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:09,800
Our son is dead
and I haven't told Martha!

1366
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:13,200
Our son is dead, Martha doesn't know,
and you won't tell her!

1367
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:19,400
I'll tell her myself.
In good time I'll tell her myself.

1368
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:21,100
I'm going to be sick.

1369
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:23,000
Are you? That's nice.

1370
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:26,600
- I'm going to die.
- Good, go right ahead.

1371
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,100
Martha, I have some...

1372
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,300
...terrible news.

1373
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,000
It's about our son.

1374
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,100
He's dead.

1375
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,300
Do you hear me, Martha?

1376
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,100
Our boy is dead.

1377
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,000
Where the hell is everybody?

1378
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:50,200
I'll give you bastards five to come from
wherever you're hiding!

1379
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,300
By God, you've gone crazy too.

1380
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,100
I said you've gone crazy too.

1381
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,100
Probably.

1382
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:22,200
You've all gone crazy.

1383
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:25,800
I come downstairs and what happens?

1384
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:35,900
What happens?

1385
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:44,100
My wife's in the can with
a liquor bottle and she winks at me.

1386
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:46,700
Winks at me!

1387
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,700
She's never winked at you?

1388
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:52,500
What a shame!

1389
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:57,000
She's lying down on the floor,
on the tiles, all curled-up...

1390
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:02,100
...and she starts peeling
the label on the brandy bottle.

1391
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:05,200
Maybe she'd be
more comfortable in the tub.

1392
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,900
And I asked her what she's doing
and she goes...

1393
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,700
..."Sshh, nobody knows I'm here."

1394
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,400
And I come down here...

1395
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:23,200
...and you're stumbling around going
"clink", for God's sake, "clink".

1396
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,400
You've all gone crazy.

1397
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,900
Sad but true.

1398
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,200
Where is your husband?

1399
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,400
He is vanished.

1400
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,100
You're all crazy.

1401
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:48,000
Nuts!

1402
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:52,600
'Tis the refuge we take
when the unreality of the world...

1403
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:55,200
...sits too heavy on our tiny heads.

1404
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:01,400
Relax! Sink into it. You're no better
than anybody else.

1405
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:04,400
I think I am.

1406
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:13,800
You're certainly a flop
in some departments.

1407
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,300
What'd you say?

1408
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:28,800
I said you're a flop
in some departments.

1409
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,800
I'm sorry you're disappointed.

1410
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:33,900
Maybe some time
when I didn't drink for ten hours.

1411
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:37,800
Baby, you sure are a flop!

1412
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:42,000
You're something. You know that?
You're really something!

1413
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:46,600
To you, everybody's a flop!

1414
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,500
Your husband's a flop, I'm a flop.

1415
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:49,800
You're all flops.

1416
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:54,000
I am the Earth Mother
and you are all flops.

1417
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:01,100
I disgust me.

1418
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:12,100
There's only been one man in my life
who's ever made me happy.

1419
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:16,200
You know that? One.

1420
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,700
The gym instructor or something?

1421
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:22,900
George.

1422
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,300
My husband.

1423
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,000
You're kidding?

1424
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,000
You must be. Him?

1425
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:36,800
You don't believe it.

1426
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,500
Why, of course I do.

1427
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,800
You always deal on appearances?

1428
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:42,300
For God's sake!

1429
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,500
George who is out
somewhere there in the dark.

1430
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:51,700
Who is good to me. Whom I revile.

1431
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:57,900
Who can keep learning the games we play
as quickly as I can change them.

1432
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:01,700
Who can make me happy
and I do not wish to be happy.

1433
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,700
Yes, I do wish to be happy.

1434
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
George and Martha.

1435
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,200
Sad, sad, sad.

1436
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:17,500
Whom I will not forgive
for having come to rest.

1437
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,500
For having seen me and having said...

1438
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:24,100
..."Yes, this will do."

1439
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:28,700
Who has made the hideous, the hurting...

1440
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:33,600
...the insulting mistake of loving me.

1441
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,200
And must be punished for it.

1442
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:44,900
Sad, sad, sad.

1443
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:49,700
Some day...

1444
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:53,100
...some night...

1445
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:57,800
...some stupid liquor-ridden night
I will go too far.

1446
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:03,100
I'll either break his back or I'll
push him off for good, which I deserve.

1447
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,400
I don't think he's got
a vertebrae intact.

1448
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:10,600
Oh, you don't?

1449
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,500
You don't think so?

1450
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:14,900
Oh, little boy!

1451
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:19,300
You've got yourself so hunched over
your microphone...

1452
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:20,900
Microscope!

1453
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,600
Yes. And you don't
see anything, do you?

1454
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:26,600
You see everything
but the goddamn mind.

1455
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:31,300
You see all the specks and the crap,
but you don't see what goes on, do you?

1456
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:36,600
You know so little. And you're going
to take over the world, huh?

1457
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:38,600
I said, all right!

1458
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:42,600
The stallion's mad, huh?

1459
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,300
The gelding's getting all upset, huh?

1460
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,600
You swing wild, don't you?

1461
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,600
You poor little bastard!

1462
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,300
Hit out at everything!

1463
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,300
Go answer the door.

1464
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,100
What'd you say to me?

1465
01:42:57,500 --> 01:43:00,000
I said go answer the door.
What are you, deaf?

1466
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:02,500
You want me to go answer the door?

1467
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,300
That's right, lunkhead,
go answer the door.

1468
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,300
Or are you too drunk to do that, too?

1469
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,100
There's no need for you to...

1470
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:11,700
Answer it!

1471
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,100
You be houseboy around here awhile.

1472
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:16,300
You can start in
being houseboy right now.

1473
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:18,300
Look, I'm no flunky to you.

1474
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:21,200
Sure, you are!
You're ambitious, aren't you?

1475
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:25,700
You didn't come back here with me
out of driven passion, did you?

1476
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:29,300
You were thinking a little bit
about your career.

1477
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:34,700
You can just houseboy your way up
the ladder for awhile.

1478
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:37,900
There's no limit to you, is there?

1479
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,400
No, baby, none. Go answer the door.

1480
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:42,200
Go on, git!

1481
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,000
Aimless. Wanton.

1482
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,500
Now, you just do as you're told.

1483
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:51,400
You show ol' Martha
there's something you can do.

1484
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:54,000
I'm coming, for Christ's sake!

1485
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,000
Wonderful! Marvelous!

1486
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,100
Just a gigolo everywhere I go.

1487
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,200
Stop that!

1488
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:04,400
Sorry, baby. Now you go
answer the little door, huh?

1489
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:15,400
How lovely!

1490
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:21,400
Why, sonny, you came home
for your birthday at last!

1491
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:23,300
Get away from me!

1492
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:26,700
That's the houseboy, for God's sake!

1493
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:31,200
That's not our own little Sonny-Jim,
our own all-American something or other?

1494
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:35,600
I certainly hope not.
He's been acting awful funny if he is.

1495
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:37,700
I'll bet. Chippie, chippie, huh?

1496
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,500
I brung these flowers...

1497
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,200
...'cause youse...

1498
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,700
Aw, hell, Martha!

1499
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:55,200
Pansies, rosemary, violence,
mah wedding bouquet!

1500
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,200
If you don't mind, I'll get my wife...

1501
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:01,900
You stay right where you are.
Make my hubby a drink.

1502
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,500
I don't think I will.

1503
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:08,200
No, Martha. That would be too much.
He's your houseboy, not mine.

1504
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,500
I'm nobody's houseboy!

1505
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:16,500
I'm nobody's houseboy now

1506
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,000
Vicious.

1507
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,500
Children? That right?

1508
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:25,000
Vicious children with their sad games
hopscotching their way through life?

1509
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,500
Something like that.

1510
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:27,700
Screw, baby.

1511
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Him can't! Him too full o' booze!

1512
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:34,700
Weally? Here! Dump these in some gin.

1513
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:40,000
A terrible thing to do
to Martha's snapdragons!

1514
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,700
Is that what they are?

1515
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:46,200
Yup. And I went by moonlight to Daddy's
greenhouse to pick them for her.

1516
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:49,400
There is no moon.
I saw it go down from the bedroom.

1517
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:50,900
From the bedroom?

1518
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:54,200
There is a moon.

1519
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:57,100
There is no goddamn moon,
the moon went down.

1520
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:59,100
That may be, Chastity,
but it came back up.

1521
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:00,100
Bull!

1522
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:03,300
Once when I was sailing past Majorca,
the moon went down...

1523
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:06,600
...thought about it awhile then,
pop, came up again.

1524
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:09,800
That is not true. That is such a lie!

1525
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:12,400
You must not call everything a lie.
Must she?

1526
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:14,900
I don't know when you people are lying.

1527
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:18,100
- You're damn right!
- You're not supposed to.

1528
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:23,600
- So, I was sailing past Majorca...
- You never sailed past Majorca.

1529
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:27,600
You were never in
the Mediterranean at all, ever!

1530
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:30,900
My mom and dad took me
as a college graduation present.

1531
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,800
After you killed them?

1532
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:35,500
Maybe.

1533
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,300
Yeah. And maybe not too.

1534
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,900
Jesus!

1535
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:45,100
Truth and illusion. Who knows
the difference, toots? Houseboy?

1536
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:46,300
I'm not a houseboy.

1537
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:49,900
You don't make it in the sack,
you're a houseboy.

1538
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,600
Then you must have made it, yes?

1539
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:57,600
Somebody's lying, not playing the
game straight. Who's lying? Martha?

1540
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,000
Tell him I'm not a houseboy.

1541
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:03,800
You're not a houseboy.

1542
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
So be it.

1543
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,800
Truth and illusion.
You don't know the difference.

1544
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,300
No, but we must carry on
as though we did.

1545
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:19,700
Amen.

1546
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:22,700
Snap went the dragons.

1547
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:23,700
Thank you.

1548
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:25,500
Skip it.

1549
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,000
I said snap went the dragons!

1550
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:28,700
Yeah, we know.

1551
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:30,700
Don't!

1552
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,200
Don't do that.

1553
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:33,300
Shut up, stud!

1554
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:34,700
I'm not a stud.

1555
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Then you're a houseboy. Which is it?

1556
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,500
Does it matter to you?

1557
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:43,300
No, actually it doesn't.
Either way I've had it.

1558
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,900
Stop throwing these damn things at me!

1559
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:49,400
- Either way. Snap!
- Shall I do something to him?

1560
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:51,000
You leave him alone!

1561
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:53,700
Which are you, baby, houseboy or stud?

1562
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:59,700
Truth or illusion, George?
Doesn't it matter to you at all?

1563
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:05,400
Snap! You got your answer, baby.

1564
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:11,500
Got it.

1565
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,400
You just gird your
blue-veined loins, girl.

1566
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:21,900
There's one more game to play.
It's called Bringing up Baby.

1567
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:26,200
I don't want a fuss. Don't want
any scandal around here, do you?

1568
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,400
Want to keep to your timetable?
Then sit!

1569
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:33,700
And you, pretty miss, you like fun and
games! You're a sport from way back!

1570
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:35,100
All right.

1571
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:37,600
Good. But we're not all here.

1572
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,900
Your little wifelet isn't here.

1573
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:43,600
She had a rough night...

1574
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:47,200
We can't play without everybody.
We need your little wife.

1575
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:51,100
Cut that!

1576
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:55,400
Just get off your butt and bring
that little dip back in here!

1577
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:58,800
Now be a good puppy, go fetch.
Fetch, good puppy.

1578
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:10,200
One more game.

1579
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:20,600
I don't like what's going to happen.

1580
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:22,400
Do you know what it is?

1581
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:25,700
No. But I don't like it.

1582
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:27,700
Maybe you will, Martha.

1583
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:30,900
It's a real fun game.

1584
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:32,600
No more games.

1585
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:36,800
One more, Martha. One more game
and then beddie-bye.

1586
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:41,400
Everybody packs up his tools
and baggage and stuff and go home.

1587
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:43,400
And you and me...

1588
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,500
...we're going to climb
them well-worn stairs.

1589
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,400
No, George, no.

1590
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,100
Yes, baby.

1591
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,600
It'll all be done before you know it.

1592
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,400
No climb stairs with Georgie?

1593
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:01,100
No more games. It's games I don't want.
No more games, please.

1594
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:05,300
Sure you do. Original game girl!
Of course you do.

1595
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:10,300
Don't you touch me!

1596
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,700
Keep your paws clean
for the undergraduates.

1597
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:15,800
Listen to me!

1598
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:17,400
You've had an evening.

1599
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:22,100
You can't stop when there's enough
blood in your mouth. We're going on.

1600
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:26,100
I'm having at you, and your performance
will look like an Easter pageant.

1601
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,700
Get yourself alert.

1602
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,500
- Get some life in you.
- Stop!

1603
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:30,900
Pull yourself together!

1604
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:34,400
I'm going to knock you around
and I want you up for it!

1605
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:36,600
What do you want?

1606
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,600
- An equal battle.
- You'll get it.

1607
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,300
- I want you mad.
- I'm mad. Don't worry about it!

1608
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,100
Good girl!
We'll play to the death.

1609
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:46,200
- Yours?
- You'll be surprised.

1610
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,800
Here come the tots. Be ready.

1611
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:49,100
I'm ready for you.

1612
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,000
Hip, hop. Hip, hip, hop.

1613
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,300
Are you a bunny, honey!

1614
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:56,900
- How's the bunny?
- Bunny funny!

1615
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:58,800
Bunny funny. Good for bunny.

1616
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:00,500
Honey funny bunny.

1617
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:04,000
All right, here we go.

1618
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:06,000
Last game. All sit.

1619
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:11,000
- Sit down. This is a civilized game.
- Just get on with it.

1620
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:15,500
I think we've been having a real good
evening, all things considered.

1621
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:18,700
We've got to know each other.
And we've had fun and games.

1622
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:20,900
Like Curl Up On The Floor.

1623
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:21,800
The Tiles.

1624
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,400
The Tiles, Snap The Dragon.

1625
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:24,700
Peel the Label!

1626
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:27,800
Label. Peel the Label.

1627
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:29,700
I peel labels.

1628
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:31,900
We all peel labels, sweetie.

1629
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:35,200
When you get through the skin,
and through the muscle...

1630
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:39,700
...and slosh aside the organs, down to
the bone, you know what you do?

1631
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:42,500
When you get down to the bone...

1632
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:45,300
...you aren't all the way.
Something's inside the bone.

1633
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:47,800
The marrow.
That's what you got to get at.

1634
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:51,500
But bones are pretty resilient,
especially in the young.

1635
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:53,000
Now take our son...

1636
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:57,700
Our son. Martha's and my little joy.

1637
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:01,200
Just what are you doing?

1638
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,800
- I'm talking about our son.
- Well, don't.

1639
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:06,400
I want to.
It's important we talk about him.

1640
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:09,700
You want to hear about our
bouncy boy, don't you?

1641
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:13,200
Martha's and my son.

1642
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:17,100
You have a child?

1643
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,500
Yes indeed, do we ever!

1644
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,400
Will you talk about him or shall I?

1645
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:24,300
- Don't.
- All rightie, now let's see.

1646
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:26,300
He's nice, despite home his life.

1647
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:30,400
Most kids would be neurotic,
Martha carrying on the way she does.

1648
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:33,900
Sleeping till 4 p. M.
Climbing over the poor bastard...

1649
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:38,700
...trying to break the bathroom door
to wash him in the tub when he's 16.

1650
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:41,400
Dragging strangers
to the house all hours.

1651
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:44,400
That's enough.

1652
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,000
Do you want to take over?

1653
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:48,900
Why would anyone want to
wash a 16 year-old?

1654
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:50,600
For Christ's sake!

1655
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:52,000
Well, why?

1656
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,700
Because it's her baby-poo.

1657
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:55,200
All right.

1658
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:58,600
Our son, you want our son?
You'll have it.

1659
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:02,600
Do you want a drink?

1660
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:09,100
We don't have to hear it
if you don't want to.

1661
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,900
Who says? You in a position
to set the rules?

1662
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:15,800
Good boy. You'll go far.

1663
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:18,600
All right, your recitation please.

1664
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:25,700
Our son...

1665
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:26,900
All right!

1666
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,100
Our son.

1667
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:35,600
Our son was born in a September night,
a night not unlike tonight...

1668
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:38,900
...though tomorrow...

1669
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:41,500
...and sixteen years ago.

1670
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:43,100
See, I told you.

1671
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:47,900
- It was an easy birth.
- No, you labored, how you labored!

1672
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:49,800
It was an easy birth!

1673
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:52,400
Once it had been...

1674
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:54,000
...accepted.

1675
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:57,600
- Relaxed into.
- That's better.

1676
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:02,000
It was an easy birth,
once it had been accepted.

1677
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:05,100
And I was young.

1678
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:07,300
And he was healthy...

1679
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,700
...a red, bawling child.

1680
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:13,500
Martha thinks she saw him at delivery.

1681
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,200
With slippery, firm limbs.

1682
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:21,200
And a full head of black, fine hair.

1683
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:23,700
Which, later...

1684
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,500
...later became...

1685
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:29,000
...blond as the sun.

1686
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:32,000
Our son.

1687
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:33,700
He was a healthy child.

1688
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:39,100
And I had wanted a child.
Oh, I had wanted a child!

1689
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:41,000
A son? Daughter?

1690
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,400
A child!

1691
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:49,000
I had my child.

1692
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:50,500
Our child.

1693
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:55,000
And we raised him.

1694
01:54:57,900 --> 01:54:59,900
Yes, we did. We raised him.

1695
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:06,400
And he had green eyes.

1696
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:12,000
Such green, green eyes.

1697
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:15,100
Blue, green, brown.

1698
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:17,800
And he loved the sun.

1699
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:21,500
And he was tan
before and after everyone.

1700
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,200
And in the sun...

1701
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:27,600
...his hair became...

1702
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:29,700
...fleece.

1703
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:36,700
Beautiful, beautiful boy.

1704
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:45,000
So beautiful, so wise.

1705
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:46,900
All truth being relative.

1706
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,300
It was true.

1707
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,300
Beautiful, wise, perfect!

1708
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:55,100
There's a real mother talking.

1709
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:57,300
I want a child!

1710
01:55:59,000 --> 01:55:59,900
On principle?

1711
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:02,800
I want a child. I want a baby.

1712
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:05,400
This perfection could not last.

1713
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,000
Not with George.

1714
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:10,600
Not with George around.

1715
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,200
There, you see, I knew she'd shift.

1716
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,100
- Be still!
- Sorry, Mother.

1717
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:15,700
Can't you be still?

1718
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:20,900
Not with George. A drowning man takes
down those nearest, and he tried.

1719
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:24,600
And, God, how I fought him!
How I fought him!

1720
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,300
The one thing...

1721
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:29,100
...I tried to carry unscathed
through the...

1722
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:31,500
...sewer of our marriage...

1723
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,600
...through the sick nights and the
pathetic, stupid days...

1724
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,300
...through the derision and the
laughter. God, the laughter!

1725
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:43,300
Through one failure after another.

1726
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:47,500
Each attempt more numbing,
more sickening than the one before.

1727
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:51,700
The one thing, the one person
I tried to protect...

1728
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:56,800
...to raise above the mire of this vile,
crushing marriage...

1729
01:56:57,700 --> 01:57:01,700
...the one light in all this
hopeless darkness! Our son!

1730
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:02,700
Stop it!

1731
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:08,800
Why, don't you like it?

1732
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,500
You can't do this.

1733
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:11,500
Who says?

1734
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:13,900
- I say!
- Tell us why, baby.

1735
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:16,300
Is this game over?

1736
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:20,800
Oh, no! Not by a long shot.

1737
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:24,700
I've got a surprise for you.
It's about sonny-Jim.

1738
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:28,200
I'm running this show!

1739
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,200
Sweetheart...

1740
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:33,700
...I'm afraid I've got
some bad news for you.

1741
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:36,200
For both of us, I mean.
Some rather sad news.

1742
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:38,700
What is this?

1743
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:42,900
Martha, while you were busy,
while the two of you were busy...

1744
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:45,200
...I don't know where,
but you were somewhere...

1745
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:47,600
...while you were busy for awhile...

1746
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:51,100
...Missy and I
were having a little talk.

1747
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:53,400
You know, a chaw and a talk.

1748
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:55,300
And the doorbell rang.

1749
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:56,500
Chimed.

1750
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:04,400
It's hard for me to tell you.

1751
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:07,300
Please don't!

1752
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:08,600
Tell me!

1753
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:13,600
It was good old Western Union,
some little boy about seventy.

1754
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,500
Crazy Billy?

1755
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:17,400
That's right. Crazy Billy.

1756
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:20,600
And he had a telegram and it was for us.

1757
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:23,700
I have to tell you about it.

1758
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:29,600
Why did they bring it?
Why didn't they telephone it?

1759
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:34,700
There are some telegrams you have to
deliver, Martha. Some you cannot phone.

1760
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:37,400
What do you mean?

1761
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:41,800
I can hardly bring myself to say it.

1762
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:43,900
You want to do it?

1763
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:54,100
Well, Martha, I'm afraid our boy
isn't coming home for his birthday.

1764
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,400
Of course he is!

1765
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:58,900
Of course he is! I say he is!

1766
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,100
He can't.

1767
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:05,700
Our son...

1768
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:07,800
...is...

1769
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:10,200
...dead.

1770
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:14,500
He was killed late in the afternoon...

1771
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:17,400
...on a country road with his
learner's permit.

1772
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:20,100
He swerved to avoid a porcupine
and drove...

1773
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:21,600
You can't do that!

1774
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:24,000
...into a large tree.

1775
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:26,600
You cannot do that!

1776
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:29,800
I thought you should know.

1777
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:33,300
You cannot do that!

1778
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:36,500
You can't decide these things
for yourself!

1779
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:39,000
I will not let you do that!

1780
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:41,000
Have to leave around noon, I suppose.

1781
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:43,300
I won't let you decide these things.

1782
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:46,800
There are matters of identification,
arrangements to be made.

1783
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,300
You can't do this! I won't let you!

1784
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,800
- Get your hands off me!
- I haven't done anything!

1785
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:55,500
Now you listen to me. Our son is dead!

1786
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:57,300
Can you get that through your head?

1787
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:02,700
Listen carefully. We got a telegram.
There was a car accident and he's dead!

1788
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,700
Poof! Just like that!
Now how do you like it?

1789
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:11,800
Let her go.
She'll be all right.

1790
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,400
He is not dead.

1791
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:28,900
He is dead.

1792
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,500
You cannot decide.

1793
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:39,000
He hasn't decided anything.

1794
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:42,500
It's not his doing.
He doesn't have the power.

1795
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:47,200
That's right. I'm no god. I have
no power over life and death, do I?

1796
02:00:49,100 --> 02:00:51,200
You can't kill him.

1797
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:54,100
You can't let him die!

1798
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,400
There was a telegram.

1799
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:07,400
Show it to me! Show me that telegram!

1800
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:13,400
I ate it.

1801
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:16,900
What did you just say to me?

1802
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,600
I ate it.

1803
02:01:23,900 --> 02:01:25,300
Good for you, Martha.

1804
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:28,800
You make a joke at a time like this?

1805
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,400
Did I not eat the telegram?

1806
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:33,400
You ate it. I watched you
and you ate it all down.

1807
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:34,800
Like a good boy.

1808
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:38,200
You won't get away with this.

1809
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,800
You know the rules, for God's sake!

1810
02:01:44,100 --> 02:01:45,600
What are you talking about?

1811
02:01:45,900 --> 02:01:47,300
I can kill him if I want to.

1812
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:48,700
He is our child.

1813
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:52,200
- You bore him. A good delivery.
- He is our child.

1814
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,600
And I've killed him.

1815
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,500
Oh my God, I think I understand this.

1816
02:01:59,000 --> 02:01:59,900
Do you?

1817
02:02:00,700 --> 02:02:04,000
- Oh my God, I think I understand this.
- Good for you.

1818
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:11,900
You've no right.
You've no right at all.

1819
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:16,600
I have the right, we never spoke of it.
I could kill him any time I wanted.

1820
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:18,500
Why?

1821
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,000
You broke our rule, Martha.

1822
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:23,800
You mentioned him to somebody else.

1823
02:02:24,100 --> 02:02:26,000
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

1824
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:31,500
To me, you mentioned him to me.

1825
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:35,800
I forget.

1826
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:41,100
Sometimes when it's late night
and everybody's talking...

1827
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:43,500
...I forget and I want to mention him.

1828
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:46,500
But I hold on. I hold on.

1829
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:50,500
I've wanted to so often.

1830
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:53,500
But, George, you've pushed it.

1831
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:57,000
There was no need,
there was no need for this!

1832
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:00,500
I mentioned him, all right?

1833
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:04,400
But you didn't have
to push it over the edge.

1834
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:07,200
You didn't have to kill him.

1835
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:18,700
You didn't have to have him die.

1836
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:27,000
That wasn't needed.

1837
02:03:56,700 --> 02:03:58,200
It's dawn.

1838
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:01,700
I think the party's over.

1839
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:09,300
You couldn't have any?

1840
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,200
We couldn't.

1841
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:20,900
Home to bed, children.
It's way past your bedtime.

1842
02:04:31,900 --> 02:04:33,300
You two go now.

1843
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:49,500
- I'd like to...
- Goodnight.

1844
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:18,000
You want anything?

1845
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:20,800
No. Nothing.

1846
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:28,000
Time for bed.

1847
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:35,700
Tired?

1848
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:37,100
Yes.

1849
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:39,400
I am.

1850
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:50,400
Sunday tomorrow.

1851
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,000
All day.

1852
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:33,600
Did you have to?

1853
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:36,700
Yes.

1854
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:42,900
You had to?

1855
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,700
I don't know.

1856
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:56,400
- It was time.
- Was it?

1857
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:09,200
I'm cold.

1858
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:12,800
It's late.

1859
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:26,800
It will be better.

1860
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:31,700
I don't know.

1861
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:34,500
It will be. Maybe.

1862
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,800
I'm not sure.

1863
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:48,800
Just us?

1864
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:55,000
- You don't suppose maybe...
- No.

1865
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,700
- You all right?
- Yes.

1866
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:17,500
No.

1867
02:08:22,700 --> 02:08:26,100
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

1868
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:29,800
I am, George.

1869
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:34,800
I am, George.

1870
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:37,900
I am.
