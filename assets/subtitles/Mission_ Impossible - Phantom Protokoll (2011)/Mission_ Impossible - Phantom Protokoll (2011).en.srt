1
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,871
Hey!

2
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,510
Let's give you a few friends to play with.

3
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,526
Sorry.

4
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,336
Okay, I'm set.
How's things going down below?

5
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:15,253
How do you think? I'm in a sewer.

6
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,870
I'm in position.

7
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,038
Move to phase 2.

8
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,511
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

9
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,430
What's wrong?
What's happening, Benji?

10
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,139
Oh, God.
He's not going to the extraction point.

11
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,433
Stay focused.
He knows where he's going.

12
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,944
No, I'm not. I won't.
I will not open that door.

13
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,281
Please go to the extraction point, Ethan.
I know.

14
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,117
I know what this means, but I can't.
I'm not authorized.. .

15
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,286
Go to the extraction point, Ethan.

16
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,954
Go to the extraction point!

17
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,165
Oh, you're just going to wait.

18
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,334
We're going to wait. Great. I can wait.

19
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,471
Okay, fine. Fine! Fine!

20
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,014
There.

21
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:33,725
We'll just screw
the whole thing up on purpose.

22
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,317
Jane? We're going
to have a slight delay.

23
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,297
Why do you want to go in there?

24
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,362
I don't know what he's doing,
and for some reason, I'm helping him.

25
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,781
As long as he's where he should be
when the song ends.

26
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,079
We have a passenger.

27
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:02,898
Sergei!

28
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,076
Open all of them!

29
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,394
Agent Hunt?

30
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
And you are?

31
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,231
Agent Carter.

32
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:28,067
Okay.

33
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,945
Who's your pal?

34
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,238
I'll tell you on the way!

35
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,034
Light the fuse.

36
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,908
I don't mean to bring up
the elephant in the room,

37
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,786
but what's with the big, hairy Russian?

38
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:47,121
Who, Bogdan? He fed me intel. If I left
him there, they would've killed him.

39
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,706
So we're gonna give him his freedom.

40
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:49,875
Did you call in the sweepers?

41
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,959
On their way.

42
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,794
Good, good.

43
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,881
Benji, how is it you're here?

44
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,009
Oh, I passed the field exam.

45
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,135
Crazy, right?

46
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,179
Yeah. Crazy.

47
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,889
-DNA test.
-It's me.

48
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,808
It's procedure.
I'm just confirming it's you.

49
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,726
-You're very thorough.
-Sergei?

50
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,144
Are you not Russian?

51
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,316
Sweepers approaching! Brooms are out!

52
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,900
-Roger that.
-Sergei.

53
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,363
Are you not Sergei?

54
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,576
You'll be fine.

55
00:12:25,702 --> 00:12:26,912
Bogdan.

56
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,455
I always take care of my friends.

57
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,499
My friend.

58
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,256
Messy bringing him along.

59
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,924
I thought it went rather well.

60
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,009
Mind telling me what you were doing
in a Russian prison?

61
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,971
Mind telling me why you broke me out?

62
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:47,349
This wasn't a rescue mission?

63
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,975
Let me put it this way.

64
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,727
If the Secretary wanted me out of there,

65
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,856
it must be pretty bad out here.

66
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,653
We were after a file.

67
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,697
We lost it.

68
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,323
"We"? Who lost it? You?

69
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,038
Agent Hanaway.

70
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,749
Where's Hanaway?

71
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,178
It was a letter drop.

72
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,929
Classified file.

73
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:29,600
It should have been a simple intercept.

74
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,902
We knew which train
the courier was on.

75
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,820
ETA, two minutes on the courier.

76
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,363
But there was one thing we didn't know.

77
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,657
Bobcat, your train's six minutes out.

78
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,908
Who the courier was.

79
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,341
It's now or never, Bobcat.

80
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,595
The courier delivering the file,
what's his name?

81
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:08,221
Go ahead. Shoot.

82
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,224
We are out of time.

83
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,399
I need a name, folks.
I can't track all these people at once.

84
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:24,071
Marek. Stefanski. For the love of God!

85
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,197
You got it?

86
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,323
Marek Stefanski.

87
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,952
Searching.

88
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,176
I'll take it from here.

89
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:57,854
Hey, you all right, buddy?

90
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,065
Hanaway dropped the mark
and grabbed his bag.

91
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,650
Sit down. Catch your breath.

92
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,572
He had the file in his hands.
Easy in, easy out.

93
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,698
File secured.

94
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,287
But we weren't the only ones after it.

95
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,289
Bobcat, someone else
has crashed this party.

96
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,500
I'm not alone.

97
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,586
Local police?

98
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,879
No. Armed hostiles.

99
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,057
Hang tight, I'm coming!
Outrigger, back him up.

100
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,975
Negative, Outrigger.

101
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:38,477
Rendezvous southwest corner,
60 seconds.

102
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:43,609
Hanaway's lens cam drew a facial
match and triggered a warning.

103
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,113
But it was too late.

104
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,413
No!

105
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,711
You're going to be okay.

106
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,883
You're so beautiful.

107
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,054
I'm sorry, I. .. I should have told you.

108
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,394
It was my op.

109
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,898
I put him in the field.

110
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,777
And she left him
just alive enough for me to see him die.

111
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,586
I'm sorry.

112
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,924
You know her?

113
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,052
That's Sabine Moreau. Contract killer.

114
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,764
Works for diamonds.

115
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,265
What was in the file?

116
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,402
Russian nuclear launch codes.

117
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:20,079
IMF's been looking for an emerging
extremist, code name, Cobalt.

118
00:17:20,163 --> 00:17:23,290
He's determined to detonate
a nuclear weapon however he can.

119
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,544
We know Moreau's
worked for him before.

120
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,796
What else does IMF know about him?

121
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,298
As much as you do now.

122
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,425
But if Moreau has nuclear launch codes,

123
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,136
you can bet Cobalt's gone
from a person of interest

124
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,637
to enemy number one.

125
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,640
We're here.

126
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,498
Agent confirmed.

127
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,666
Why was he in prison?

128
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:10,463
He disappeared after he and his wife.. .
You know.

129
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,634
I thought he'd just been transferred.
Put on leave.

130
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:19,765
There were rumors, though.
Talk of an unsanctioned hit.

131
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,432
Welcome back, Mr. Hunt.

132
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,769
In your absence,
IMF has learned that Cobalt is or was

133
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,564
a level-1 nuclear strategist
for Russian intelligence.

134
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:30,776
Therefore, the only way to uncover
his actual identity

135
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,153
is to infiltrate the Kremlin itself.

136
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,614
In order to get past their checkpoints,

137
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,616
you'll be impersonating
General Anatoly Fedorov.

138
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,660
We believe Cobalt
will do everything he can

139
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,746
to destroy any record of his identity.

140
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,914
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

141
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,125
is to penetrate the highly-secured
archive inside the Kremlin

142
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,420
and retrieve Cobalt's file
before he can destroy it.

143
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,883
New intel suggests Cobalt
is already en route, leaving you. ..

144
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,551
...4 hours 52 minutes...

145
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,929
...to infiltrate.

146
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,681
To save time,
we've chosen your team for you.

147
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,141
Agents Carter and Dunn.

148
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:10,065
As always, should you or any member
of your team be caught or killed,

149
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:13,151
the Secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.

150
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,737
This message
will self-destruct in five seconds.

151
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,071
Good luck, Ethan.

152
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:42,221
What do you got?

153
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,894
We're going into the Kremlin.

154
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:56,819
I thought you said "The Kremlin."

155
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,531
Okay.

156
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,988
This is very exciting.

157
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,949
Being out in the field.

158
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,784
With you, you know.

159
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,453
It's a bit of a dream for me.

160
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:53,084
Love your disguise, by the way.
You look just like him.

161
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,463
It's a shame we're not wearing masks.
You know, like, full masks.

162
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,967
Everybody gets to
wear a mask but Benji.

163
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,053
Sorry.

164
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,930
I'm tense. I babble when I'm nervous.

165
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,972
I'm doing it again. Shut up, Benji.

166
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,571
Okay, seven security guards.

167
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,282
X-ray machines. Cameras.
Metal detectors.

168
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,535
Just what we expected. We can do this.

169
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,835
Releasing in three, two, one.

170
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,679
Game face, game face.
Kremlin game face.

171
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,304
I think that went quite well.

172
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,016
It's going to work.

173
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:42,020
I'm sorry, by the way.
About you and Julia.

174
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,357
You know, not working out.

175
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,112
I wanted to say something
before you went away, but. ..

176
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:50,572
I liked her, you know.

177
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,365
He's off the phone now.

178
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,959
It's empty.

179
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:34,503
The nest is empty.

180
00:28:49,435 --> 00:28:50,728
Check in, Team Leader.

181
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:51,938
Over.

182
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,272
Repeat. Check in, Team Leader.

183
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,776
Have you made it to the Archive Room?

184
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,490
Someone is piggybacking our frequency.

185
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,826
Team Leader,

186
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:09,747
awaiting your go-sign.
Standing by to detonate.

187
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,957
Abort.

188
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,295
Rendezvous nine-two.

189
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:34,160
Our media is no more
truthful than yours,

190
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,494
American.

191
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,833
But we both know
that the real cause of the explosion

192
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,500
was you.

193
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,967
Awaiting your go-sign, Team Leader.

194
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,052
Standing by to detonate.

195
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,512
The worst part for you,

196
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,598
"Team Leader,"

197
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,728
is I am the man assigned
to make you suffer for it.

198
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,396
For what you did to my country.

199
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,661
Not a good idea.

200
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,958
It seemed like one a minute ago.

201
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,327
Consolidated Insurance.

202
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,452
How may I help you?

203
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:08,498
SAT 20. Agent 82-Delta-Echo
requesting immediate evac.

204
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,126
Rendezvous Alpha 1 13.

205
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,045
Confirmed. Alpha 113.

206
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,364
Details surrounding
the intricate system of gas lines

207
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:43,117
that run beneath the square
are still forthcoming,

208
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,202
but the majority of
those lines date back to the Soviet era

209
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,496
and have not been updated in at least. ..

210
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,719
We should leave town
for a couple of days.

211
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,431
Alex, you, me. Vacations.

212
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,766
-Now?
-Tonight.

213
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,061
Just.. .

214
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,898
Just the three of us.

215
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,735
.. .may not have been an accident,
but a targeted attack.

216
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,445
Preliminary numbers are just starting. ..

217
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,864
Where will we go?

218
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:24,240
.. .to come in regarding
those wounded in the blast.

219
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,577
We can confirm that 11 tourists...

220
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,744
Leonid?

221
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,246
. ..their nationalities still unconfirmed,

222
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:32,666
have been transported
to area hospitals for treatment.

223
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:36,461
While Russian officials continue
to blame a gas-main break,

224
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:40,925
experts are citing the shape of the blast
area and the size of the debris field

225
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,760
as more consistent
with that of a set explosive,

226
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,846
leading to speculation
that this may have been

227
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,181
an undeclared act of aggression.

228
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,434
Although the Defense Ministry
is maintaining

229
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,851
that this is strictly an accident. ..

230
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,646
Anna, pack a bag for Alex.

231
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,315
We're leaving now.

232
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:03,030
Anya!

233
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,876
We have work to do.

234
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,782
Mr. Secretary.

235
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,454
I wasn't aware you were in Russia.

236
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:57,126
I'm not.
Not since a bomb blew up the Kremlin.

237
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:04,298
Yesterday I flew in
to accept the Order of Friendship

238
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,925
from the Russian Prime Minister.

239
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,679
Now I'm headed back to Washington

240
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:11,431
to hand the President my resignation.

241
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,811
My Chief Analyst, William Brandt.

242
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,690
Do you have a pen?

243
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:20,773
-Pardon me?
-A pen.

244
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,402
Yeah.

245
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,239
Ethan, what happened in the Kremlin?

246
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,657
Chief Analyst, you say?

247
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,534
If you're implying that
I made a bad call.. .

248
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,827
European male.

249
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:36,206
Fifties. About six-foot,
180 pounds. Blue eyes.

250
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,623
Who is he?

251
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,295
A crude drawing,
but by your description,

252
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,755
that could be Kurt Hendricks.

253
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,425
190 IQ. Served in
Swedish Special Forces.

254
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,429
Professor of physics,
Stockholm University.

255
00:39:50,512 --> 00:39:52,222
Specialist in nuclear endgame theory.

256
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,974
Asked to resign.. .

257
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,268
Well, because he's crazy.

258
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,271
Cobalt.

259
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,568
You have to alert the Kremlin
that one of their strategists

260
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,070
has a nuclear launch device

261
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,280
and one of his operatives
has the codes to activate it.

262
00:40:09,364 --> 00:40:10,615
And what makes you say that?

263
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,867
I saw him

264
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,288
leaving the executive armory,
bag in hand.

265
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:18,664
He set off that explosion
to cover his tracks.

266
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,876
It could be weeks
before the Russians know it's missing.

267
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,085
Unless we tell them.

268
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,711
They won't listen to us.

269
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:27,757
As far as the Russians are concerned,
we just bombed the Kremlin.

270
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,802
The tension between
the United States and Russia

271
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,889
hasn't been this high
since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

272
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:38,351
And the blame, right or wrong,
points to IMF.

273
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,735
The President has initiated
Ghost Protocol.

274
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,530
The entire IMF has been disavowed.

275
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,494
So what happens now?

276
00:40:55,577 --> 00:40:58,914
Now, I've been ordered
to take you back to Washington,

277
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,041
where the DOD will label you
as a rogue extremist

278
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,753
and hang the Kremlin bombing
on you and your team.

279
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,130
Unless,

280
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,465
you were to escape

281
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,760
somewhere between here
and the airport,

282
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:16,472
having assaulted Mr. Brandt and me.

283
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,557
Sir?

284
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,809
You would then

285
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:21,853
illegally scrounge
whatever material you could

286
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,481
from a backup supply cache
that I've overlooked.

287
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,900
The same cache where
your team are waiting for further orders.

288
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:28,985
Sir, you may want to. ..

289
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,865
You will then disappear, and this
conversation never having taken place,

290
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,617
your intentions would be unclear.

291
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,496
But if any one of your team
is caught or killed,

292
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,708
they will be branded terrorists,

293
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:46,295
out to incite global nuclear war.

294
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,510
Your mission,

295
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,847
should you choose to accept it.

296
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,688
Ethan, you were my best man.

297
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,733
And I'm sorry it's come to this,

298
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,318
after all the sacrifices you made.

299
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,780
If we don't meet again,
I just want you to know,

300
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,451
I've always considered you a friend.

301
00:42:19,786 --> 00:42:21,663
Stay down! Drive, drive, drive!

302
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:49,358
You okay?

303
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,483
Yeah.

304
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,737
Take a deep breath. Stay with me.

305
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,112
-Ready?
-Yeah.

306
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:21,014
What do we do?

307
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,599
Wait here.

308
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,688
Where else am I going to go?

309
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,579
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

310
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:51,146
Why would that work?

311
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,981
Why would what work?

312
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,193
The flare on the body,
why would that work?

313
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,443
It did work.

314
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:59,362
-Yeah, I know, but.. .
-Hey!

315
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:03,699
But why? I mean, how did you know
that would draw their fire?

316
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,952
I didn't. I played a hunch.

317
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,956
Okay. All right,
so what was your scenario?

318
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,793
Right, you. ..
There's a guy being shot at in the water.

319
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:17,005
All of a sudden, decides to light up
a flare and swim around?

320
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,759
I mean, what did you assume
they'd be thinking?

321
00:45:20,842 --> 00:45:22,552
-Thinking?
-Yeah.

322
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,514
I didn't assume they were thinking.

323
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,599
I assumed they were shooting
at anything that moved.

324
00:45:27,682 --> 00:45:30,059
I just gave them a target. Look, these. ..

325
00:45:30,143 --> 00:45:32,938
These guys aren't
Rhodes Scholars, you know?

326
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,652
It's really happening, isn't it?

327
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:40,528
Yeah.

328
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,114
Okay, you know what that sound is?

329
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,032
That's our ride out of here!

330
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,327
All right, it's a green car. Number 47.

331
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,083
I see green!

332
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,751
Okay, let's do it.

333
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,335
Go, go, go, go.

334
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,132
All right, 47.

335
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,465
I don't see it.

336
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,009
47.

337
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,427
Oh, shit!

338
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,936
This is it. The manifest.

339
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:14,603
Enter your code.

340
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:15,688
Pole!

341
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:19,860
Jeez.. .

342
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,903
Press enter.

343
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,615
Retinal scanner!

344
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,456
Retinal scan required.

345
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,873
Watch out!

346
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,668
Retinal scan required.

347
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:38,378
Agent confirmed.

348
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,686
Ethan? Jeez, I thought you were dead!

349
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:56,521
-We are.
-Who's this?

350
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:59,983
Agents Dunn and Carter.
William Brandt, Chief Analyst.

351
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,400
Analyst?

352
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,907
Agent confirmed.

353
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,126
How will the world finally end?

354
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,255
It is my job to predict the unthinkable.

355
00:47:23,798 --> 00:47:26,342
To treat the death of billions as a game.

356
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:31,306
After 20 years of this, I was numb.

357
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:35,143
Until a new question crossed my mind.

358
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,938
What happens after
the end of the world?

359
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,233
Are you sure your line is secure?

360
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,068
Every two or three million years.. .

361
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:46,237
Are you certain your line is secure?

362
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:50,407
. ..some natural catastrophe
devastates all life on Earth.

363
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,159
But life goes on.

364
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:56,081
And what little remains
is made stronger.

365
00:47:56,164 --> 00:48:00,210
Put simply,
world destruction is an unpleasant,

366
00:48:00,293 --> 00:48:02,670
but necessary part of evolution.

367
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:07,384
What happens then, I wondered,

368
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:10,094
when mankind faces
the next end of the world?

369
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,222
I don't care what you have to do
to get him to Dubai.

370
00:48:13,306 --> 00:48:15,766
I'll make it worth his while. Just do it.

371
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,394
I looked to Hiroshima, Nagasaki.. .

372
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,603
I'll be waiting for your call.

373
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,231
. ..thriving cities rebuilt from the ashes,

374
00:48:22,315 --> 00:48:24,650
monuments to the unimaginable,

375
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,610
dedicated to the concept of peace.

376
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,824
It occurred to me here
that nuclear war might have a place

377
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,409
in the natural order.

378
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,536
But only if it could be controlled.

379
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:40,208
Only if it touched
every living soul equally.

380
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,753
IMF now believes this man,
Kurt Hendricks,

381
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,798
is the nuclear extremist,
code name Cobalt.

382
00:48:47,882 --> 00:48:49,800
Today he was seen leaving the Kremlin,

383
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,554
with what is likely
a nuclear launch device.

384
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:58,018
Two days ago, Sabine Moreau killed
one of our agents in Budapest

385
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,769
and relieved him
of Russian nuclear launch codes.

386
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:05,358
Intel indicates she will check into
the Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.

387
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,777
Marius Wistrom
is a known operative of Cobalt.

388
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,322
Wistrom is currently en route to Dubai.

389
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:15,117
For the launch device to work,
Cobalt needs the activation codes.

390
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,038
He's sending Wistrom
to buy them from Moreau.

391
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,539
The Secretary

392
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:23,293
is dead.

393
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,467
The President
has invoked Ghost Protocol.

394
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,762
We're shut down.

395
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:37,849
No satellite, safe house,
support, or extraction.

396
00:49:37,932 --> 00:49:41,143
The four of us
and the contents of this car

397
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,855
are all that remain of the IMF.

398
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:48,318
And as of this moment, any action
is unsanctioned. So if you want out,

399
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,735
speak now.

400
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,503
Our mission is Hendricks.

401
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,713
We're all that stands
between him and his goal.

402
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,048
Nothing can be left to chance.

403
00:50:11,132 --> 00:50:13,175
Everyone connected with this man

404
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,512
is considered an asset with valuable
information about our target.

405
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,014
No one can know we're still on line.

406
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,391
We lose Hendricks now,
we lose him forever.

407
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,059
So, what's the play?

408
00:50:22,143 --> 00:50:24,771
Wistrom will take delivery from Moreau
in 36 hours.

409
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,023
Now we cannot let
the launch codes leave the hotel,

410
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:29,983
but we need Wistrom
to lead us to Hendricks.

411
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,195
He'll only do that if he has the codes.

412
00:50:32,278 --> 00:50:33,697
Or if he thinks he has them.

413
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,989
Our objective is to intercept the sale,

414
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,367
replace the authentic
codes with counterfeits

415
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,202
and follow Wistrom to Hendricks.

416
00:50:40,286 --> 00:50:41,704
Well, that's simple enough.

417
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,956
We snatch the codes,
we gin up some fakes.

418
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:48,711
Jane, you double Moreau, and sell the
codes to Wistrom and Bob's your uncle.

419
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:52,215
And how do you propose
we just snatch the codes from Moreau?

420
00:50:52,298 --> 00:50:53,298
We take her out.

421
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,221
Yeah, we take her out.
But, you know, discreetly.

422
00:50:58,304 --> 00:50:59,472
Discreetly?

423
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,224
Yeah.

424
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:05,644
Right, she's an asset. Right. I get it.
Sorry. Nothing left to chance.

425
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,231
He said. .. I'm spitballing.
It's not all gonna be gold.

426
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,940
-We don't touch Wistrom.
-All right.

427
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,025
Or Moreau.

428
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:16,447
She'll answer for Hanaway,
but it has to be when I say.

429
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,240
After we hit Hendricks.

430
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,498
Only pack what we need.

431
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,168
Yeah, absolutely. Only pack what we.. .
You never know.

432
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,489
So even if we can double
Wistrom and Moreau,

433
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,367
how do we keep them in separate rooms

434
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:04,119
while having them think that
they're in the same room?

435
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,206
We give the hotel a facelift.

436
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,166
Wistrom will think
he's arriving at Moreau's suite,

437
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,503
but, really, he'll be
walking into our decoy room.

438
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,128
Where I'll double Moreau.

439
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,755
Downstairs, Benji will double Wistrom.

440
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,215
Masks!

441
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,759
And meet with the real Moreau.

442
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:19,344
And.. .

443
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,221
What am I doing?

444
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,474
You? You're the helper!

445
00:52:27,393 --> 00:52:28,769
Helper. That's great.

446
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:33,315
Okay, so to the extent I understand
what you're talking about here. ..

447
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,985
The Burj Khalifa,
it's the tallest building in the world,

448
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,364
and you want to alter its infrastructure

449
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:42,242
with the hopes of convincing
two people that they've

450
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:45,661
had a meeting,
which actually really never happened.

451
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,413
Right?

452
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,090
Camels.

453
00:53:44,637 --> 00:53:46,806
ETA on dry cleaning.

454
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,391
On my way up.

455
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:53,771
Okay, 34 minutes to door knock.

456
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,318
Wow. ..

457
00:54:00,653 --> 00:54:04,782
Okay, this is a slight wrinkle,
but nothing to worry about.

458
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:08,202
We're just going to have to go into
the server room from the outside.

459
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,413
What?

460
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:14,208
Well, the firewalls on this building's
server are military grade.

461
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,126
I mean, this would be a cinch

462
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:17,628
if I could call Youssef
back at headquarters,

463
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,713
but Youssef doesn't exist anymore,
and neither do we.

464
00:54:19,797 --> 00:54:21,215
I could hack it,
but it would take too long.

465
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,425
Then hardwire in.

466
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,052
And there's four layers
of next-gen security

467
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,427
between us and the server room.

468
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,304
There's no way
we can get to it from inside.

469
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,557
If we can't get to the server,
we don't control the elevators,

470
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:32,518
we don't control the security cameras.

471
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,686
This operation is over
before it even begins.

472
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,773
I'm telling you,
we can get to it from outside.

473
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:37,856
"We"?

474
00:54:39,108 --> 00:54:40,360
I'm. .. I'm on the computer.

475
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,197
I'm just.. .

476
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,614
The helper.

477
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,202
What floor is it on?

478
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:51,871
130.

479
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,289
130?

480
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,670
-Vent ducts.
-Pressure sensitive.

481
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:00,755
Not enough time.

482
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:02,297
-Elevator shaft.
-Infrared sensors.

483
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,382
Not enough time.

484
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:08,721
How am I supposed to do this?

485
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,353
God damn it!

486
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,192
Oh, that's high.

487
00:55:26,739 --> 00:55:30,742
Okay, now remember, it's a rolling off
motion that disengages the bond.

488
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,996
When the meter is blue,
that's full adhesion.

489
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,248
Easy way to remember, blue is glue.

490
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:36,791
-And when it's red?
-Dead.

491
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,751
Here's your cutter, okay?
And your server interface.

492
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,672
Both going back here. One, two.

493
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:46,842
Okay, Ethan, the hotel server is
eleven stories up and seven units over.

494
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,927
Okay? Comm check.

495
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,179
Yeah. Copy.

496
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,932
So. ..

497
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,440
It's 26 minutes to door knock.

498
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:03,650
Yeah.

499
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,458
25 minutes to door knock.

500
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,849
What the hell is that?

501
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,492
Yeah, what the hell is that?

502
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,702
It's a sandstorm.

503
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,914
It's a long way off, Ethan.

504
00:57:40,998 --> 00:57:42,375
Shouldn't be a problem.

505
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,880
24 minutes to door knock.

506
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:51,967
Where's Ethan?

507
00:57:55,012 --> 00:57:56,389
You've got to be kidding me.

508
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:49,400
23 minutes to door knock.

509
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,378
I'm at server level.

510
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,485
22 minutes to door knock.

511
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,239
The countdown is not helping.

512
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,242
I'm just saying.

513
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:11,606
I'm in.

514
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:13,108
That's great, Ethan.
You're halfway home.

515
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,201
Located server.

516
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:30,835
Please tell me we're online.

517
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,210
All right, we're live.

518
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:36,548
Okay, I now have control of
the elevators and the security cameras.

519
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:37,632
Time to redecorate.

520
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,635
Okay, you drive.
And look out for Wistrom and Moreau.

521
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,737
Moreau is at the elevators
ahead of schedule.

522
01:00:58,739 --> 01:00:59,905
Go.

523
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,204
We can't open this door, can we?

524
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:08,581
The door? No.

525
01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:10,498
Ethan, you gotta get down here now.

526
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,376
Ethan!

527
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,088
Is there a problem? Ethan?

528
01:01:23,387 --> 01:01:24,387
We're not gonna make it.

529
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,472
We have to make it.

530
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:27,724
Where's Ethan?

531
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,083
Your line's not long enough!

532
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:53,918
No shit!

533
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,590
That was not easy,

534
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:44,342
but I did it.

535
01:02:46,762 --> 01:02:47,972
What'd I miss?

536
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:58,731
The lens might be a little uncomfortable.

537
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:01,652
It captures images and transmits them
to the printer in the briefcase.

538
01:03:02,778 --> 01:03:04,697
All right?

539
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:07,282
I can't see out of one eye, but I'm fine.

540
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,992
Blink twice to activate the shutter.

541
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,871
Notice the numbers are in order?

542
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,500
A perfect copy.

543
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,463
But the numbers are scrambled.

544
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:23,132
Masks?

545
01:03:23,215 --> 01:03:25,217
60 seconds.
You sure I shouldn't wear a mask?

546
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,469
You know,
'cause I'm not exactly Omar Sharif.

547
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,722
I'll play it French.
This is your tracking device.

548
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,474
-This is what you're tracking.
-The paper clip?

549
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,557
No, it's the paper.

550
01:03:32,641 --> 01:03:35,186
It's in the briefcase. It's coated with
isotopes which give off a unique.. .

551
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:36,769
It just means
that you can track the documents

552
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:37,980
even if they switch briefcases.

553
01:03:38,063 --> 01:03:39,023
Range?

554
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,148
Not that good. It's, like, half a mile.

555
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,400
Safest thing to do would be not let
Wistrom out of your sight.

556
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,902
Is that Wistrom?

557
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,324
Who's that with him?

558
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,994
I don't know. We don't have an uplink,
so there's no facial recognition.

559
01:03:52,077 --> 01:03:53,496
Who's that with him?

560
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,500
That's Leonid Lisenker.
Polish-born cryptographer.

561
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,001
He redesigned Russia's nuclear
security after the Cold War.

562
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,670
He's here to authenticate
the launch codes.

563
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,840
-Yes, he is. We are blown.
-No, we're not blown.

564
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:07,134
Well, we will be as soon as he sees
the counterfeit launch codes.

565
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:08,219
We're not blown.

566
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,054
He's in the elevator.

567
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,347
Delay them.

568
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,483
Benji, how long would it take you
to reprogram the case?

569
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,777
A couple of seconds. What for, though?

570
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,028
To make an exact copy
of the launch codes.

571
01:04:27,112 --> 01:04:28,697
-What?
-You can't do that.

572
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,282
-Wistrom's on 22!
-Slow him down.

573
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,367
I'll do what I can.

574
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:35,788
Wait, wait. Ethan, hang on now!

575
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:37,206
Hang on. Just a second.

576
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:40,793
You're talking about handing over active
nuclear launch codes to Wistrom?

577
01:04:40,876 --> 01:04:41,960
Yes. Reprogram the case.

578
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:43,045
Listen.. . Stop!

579
01:04:43,128 --> 01:04:44,128
Just listen to what you're saying.

580
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,005
You're fixating.
You're not thinking clearly.

581
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,134
It's not gonna happen. I won't let it!

582
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,552
33 and climbing!

583
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:51,804
Brandt, use your head now.

584
01:04:51,887 --> 01:04:53,597
The mission is not the codes,
the mission is Hendricks.

585
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,099
Then just let it play out.
Give him bad codes. Neutralize him.

586
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:57,226
You know that won't do it.

587
01:04:57,309 --> 01:04:59,894
Failure to a terrorist
is just a rehearsal for success.

588
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,313
41!

589
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,648
We lose Hendricks today,
he shows up somewhere else tomorrow.

590
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:04,817
He finds another way.

591
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,402
With no IMF to stop him.

592
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,653
No. It's now or never.
Now, Brandt, give me the case.

593
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:10,905
Nothing can be left to chance.
You said that.

594
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:11,990
You're the analyst.

595
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,159
Now, tell me there's not another way
for Hendricks to get those codes.

596
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,244
50!

597
01:05:15,327 --> 01:05:17,913
You tell me that this is his only avenue,
right here, right now, today.

598
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:20,416
You tell me that, I'll walk away.

599
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,757
-We go without.
-Without masks?

600
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,135
-Jane needs to go.
-Ethan!

601
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:32,219
We have no choice.

602
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:33,929
Ethan, you'd be walking in
on Moreau unarmed.

603
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:35,264
Face-first. Literally.

604
01:05:35,347 --> 01:05:36,347
How do we know they've met?

605
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,434
-How do we know they haven't?
-Doesn't matter!

606
01:05:39,768 --> 01:05:41,103
Damn it.

607
01:05:41,353 --> 01:05:42,688
We have no choice.

608
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:35,490
Goggles.

609
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,411
What if they have met?

610
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,831
Come in.

611
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:23,371
Which one of you is Wistrom?

612
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,543
I am.

613
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,878
I admire your work.

614
01:07:46,311 --> 01:07:47,478
Sit.

615
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:57,989
Where are my codes?

616
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:00,992
Where are my diamonds?

617
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,411
Close by.

618
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:05,664
You have my payment?

619
01:08:05,914 --> 01:08:07,623
When I see the codes.

620
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,460
Not to worry. Come in!

621
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,920
I thought we could have tea.

622
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,597
No diamonds, no codes.

623
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,434
No codes, no diamonds.

624
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:30,396
Kill this one.

625
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,440
We didn't come alone.

626
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,443
That hallway out there is a kill-box.

627
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,944
You know who we work for.

628
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:38,529
We come back with the codes,
or we don't come back.

629
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,783
How good is your backup?

630
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:43,452
The best.

631
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:49,166
I've killed the best.

632
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,793
Do you care for some sugar?

633
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:57,800
Enough. Let's get this done.

634
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,551
You want payment, I want guarantees.

635
01:09:01,136 --> 01:09:02,470
When he's authenticated the codes,

636
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,056
I'll make the call
and you get your diamonds.

637
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,809
That or

638
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:09,353
we all go home in buckets.

639
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,814
Nobody leaves this hotel alive.

640
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:17,528
Get the papers.

641
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:33,668
Is there a problem?

642
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,671
It's locked.

643
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:43,511
Forgive me. There must be a key.

644
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,347
One moment, huh?

645
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:48,201
My mistake.
It is a combination, not a key.

646
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,412
You tell me the numbers.

647
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:57,377
They're good.

648
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:04,259
Zero.

649
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:22,694
Come on, come on, come on.

650
01:12:06,154 --> 01:12:08,407
It was a pleasure doing business with.. .

651
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,658
Wistrom has the launch codes.
He's on the move.

652
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:14,662
Hey, I did as you asked. I did.
Now let my family go!

653
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:16,331
Release Leonid's family.

654
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:17,707
Thank God.

655
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,251
You can thank him in person.

656
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:37,435
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

657
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:55,203
Moreau's on the move!

658
01:12:56,204 --> 01:12:57,538
I've got her.

659
01:12:58,875 --> 01:12:59,875
Jane?

660
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:00,958
She's an asset!

661
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:02,543
I need her

662
01:13:02,627 --> 01:13:03,627
alive!

663
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,841
Acknowledge!

664
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:22,730
Ethan, Wistrom is in the elevator.
I can't see Leonid, though.

665
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:27,735
Benji, slow him down.
Get me an elevator.

666
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,332
Find Leonid.

667
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,140
Benji, I've got a lock on Wistrom.
But I can't tell.

668
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:58,891
Is he still in the elevator?

669
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:01,353
Benji?

670
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:06,358
Ethan. Over?

671
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,484
Benji.

672
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:08,609
Benji, I lost. ..

673
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,278
Ethan, can you hear me?

674
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:11,863
Ethan, can you hear me? Over.

675
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,198
Jesus!

676
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:21,581
Sit down!

677
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,210
-Watch her.
-Why me?

678
01:14:25,293 --> 01:14:26,795
Because if I do, I'll kill her.

679
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,909
Hold it, Team Leader.

680
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,329
Did you really think
I wouldn't catch up with you?

681
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:04,416
You and I are not enemies.
It was a set-up.. .

682
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,293
We'll find out your lies soon enough.

683
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:08,920
Move it!

684
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,547
I'm sorry about this.

685
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:35,822
Leonid. Benji?

686
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:37,323
Go for Benji.

687
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:39,283
I've got Leonid by the elevators.
He's been shot.

688
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,368
What?

689
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,965
Hey, hey. Stay with me. Stay with me.

690
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:14,610
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

691
01:16:20,952 --> 01:16:22,577
Jane! No!

692
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,551
Come on. Come on.

693
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,685
Now, what happened
with Moreau, Jane?

694
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:21,810
She couldn't help us with Hendricks.

695
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,438
So let's throw her off the building!

696
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:24,521
I didn't throw her.

697
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:25,606
Let's throw her off the building!

698
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:28,150
She was not the mission, Jane!

699
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:33,197
The mission was to track the file
back to Hendricks, who is in the wind

700
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,449
with nuclear launch codes!

701
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:38,286
Maybe you didn't notice the gun
she had pointed at me.

702
01:22:38,369 --> 01:22:40,622
Yeah, like you didn't notice
the open window,

703
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,539
or that we're about a mile up in the air!

704
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,292
It was an instinctive move.

705
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:45,376
It doesn't matter!

706
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:47,295
We're talking about a nuclear war.

707
01:22:47,378 --> 01:22:49,838
The asset is more important than you.

708
01:22:49,922 --> 01:22:52,300
Where do you get off telling me
how well I executed?

709
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:53,592
We inherited you.

710
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:56,179
You're just a bureaucrat!

711
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:58,680
Better have good news for me.
Is he here?

712
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:01,059
You think I need you to tell me
what the mission is?

713
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,935
Yeah, I got it. Dunhill lighter.
I'll be there.

714
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,688
And no one will be following me.

715
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:07,564
Just make sure no one's following you.

716
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,359
And how the hell
did the Russians find us?

717
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:11,277
-What are you asking me for?
-Because you're communications!

718
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:13,154
You're in charge of covering our tracks.

719
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:16,032
You cannot afford to make mistakes
like that now, Benji.

720
01:23:16,115 --> 01:23:18,451
You're not a technician anymore.
You're a field agent.

721
01:23:18,534 --> 01:23:21,078
And you're just an "analyst."

722
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:24,207
Right?

723
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,542
Who are you really, Brandt?

724
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:31,088
-What are you asking?
-What am I asking?

725
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:32,923
Let me see if I can put it another way.

726
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:44,268
How does an agent with skills like that
end up an analyst?

727
01:23:52,403 --> 01:23:54,612
Well, we all have our secrets.

728
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:57,698
Don't we, Ethan?

729
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:05,247
You tell me yours, I'll tell you mine.

730
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:27,185
I have friends in the region.
Just sit tight.

731
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:28,813
I'll send someone to get you out of here.

732
01:24:28,896 --> 01:24:30,064
What about Hendricks?
What's the plan?

733
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:32,859
The plan was for us
to stop him together.

734
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:35,444
Well, what are you going to do?

735
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:36,570
Change the plan.

736
01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:38,864
Wait. That's it?

737
01:24:38,948 --> 01:24:41,868
What are you going to do,
go after him alone?

738
01:24:43,494 --> 01:24:46,581
Would you care to explain yourself,
Agent Brandt?

739
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:53,480
I was on a protection detail in Croatia.

740
01:25:53,564 --> 01:25:56,650
Shadowing the assets,
husband and wife.

741
01:25:57,735 --> 01:25:59,612
They were never supposed to know
we were there.

742
01:25:59,695 --> 01:26:02,405
Whole thing's routine, it was a milk run.

743
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,536
Three days in

744
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:11,332
we caught wind that a Serbian hit squad
was after our couple.

745
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:14,001
But my team had it under control.

746
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:16,087
We knew they were coming.

747
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:20,925
But I couldn't shake this feeling that I
should warn the couple somehow.

748
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,386
I wanted to find a way to let them know.

749
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:28,682
But, you know, orders are orders,
so I didn't.

750
01:26:33,604 --> 01:26:38,024
One day, the husband decides
to leave the hotel and go for a run,

751
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:42,113
so I follow him,
and I leave two men with the wife.

752
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:47,784
When I get back, my guys are
unconscious and the wife is gone.

753
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:52,622
Local police found her body
three days later.

754
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:55,585
What was left of her, anyway.

755
01:27:01,257 --> 01:27:03,634
That was my last day in the field.

756
01:27:04,677 --> 01:27:07,721
I couldn't face another
life-or-death situation after that.

757
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:10,390
So what happened to the husband?

758
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:11,641
I never saw him again.

759
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,313
Until two days ago in Moscow,

760
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:18,149
when the Secretary
introduced me to Ethan Hunt.

761
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:25,323
No, that's not what happened.
She left him.

762
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:28,158
Yeah, I heard that one, too, Benji.

763
01:27:28,659 --> 01:27:31,578
But, unfortunately, I was there.

764
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:36,751
Just like I was there
when the Secretary got the phone call

765
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:41,171
that Ethan was in custody for killing
six Serbian nationals in cold blood.

766
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,422
An unsanctioned hit.

767
01:27:42,506 --> 01:27:43,466
Yeah.

768
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,301
Disavowed.

769
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:55,269
The next thing I know,

770
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:58,189
I'm on a plane to Dubai,

771
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:03,277
wondering the whole time, do I tell him?

772
01:28:05,529 --> 01:28:07,198
How do I tell him?

773
01:28:09,408 --> 01:28:11,202
That I'm responsible.

774
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:14,956
I could have warned him.

775
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:17,041
I should have warned him.

776
01:28:19,502 --> 01:28:20,962
But I didn't.

777
01:28:22,713 --> 01:28:24,172
And she died.

778
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,307
Sergei! Sergei, my friend!

779
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:37,435
I told you I would get him here.
Didn't I say?

780
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,645
How do I know it's him?

781
01:28:38,729 --> 01:28:42,233
Yes, it's him.
You trust me, I trust you. Right?

782
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,193
This is the guy!

783
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:46,988
This is the guy, the one I told you about.

784
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:49,614
So we can take these things off.

785
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:57,247
Sorry. He's a great guy,
but he doesn't know you like I do.

786
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:00,417
So, you work for
the American government.

787
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:03,295
And you're an arms dealer.

788
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,715
No, no, no. Sergei. Sergei.

789
01:29:06,298 --> 01:29:10,344
He's "independent
defense coordinator." Right?

790
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:13,514
That you are. Very classy job.

791
01:29:13,597 --> 01:29:14,681
Listen. He's a friend.

792
01:29:14,765 --> 01:29:16,350
Those diamonds are for Bogdan.

793
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,435
No, no. It's okay. You can have them.

794
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,689
Whatever arrangements you made with
my cousin is between you and him.

795
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,608
You want something from me, you pay.

796
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:28,945
You misunderstand.
I'm not buying. I'm selling.

797
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:31,865
You're selling.

798
01:29:31,949 --> 01:29:33,158
Selling what?

799
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:34,618
The future.

800
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:37,496
Yeah, I got all I need, thank you.

801
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:39,247
Our countries are on the brink of war.

802
01:29:39,832 --> 01:29:41,708
War is very good for business.

803
01:29:41,792 --> 01:29:43,335
Nuclear war?

804
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:54,889
Go on.

805
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:56,931
I'm looking for a man
named Kurt Hendricks.

806
01:29:57,016 --> 01:29:58,641
You may know him as Cobalt.

807
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:01,479
In either case,
I think you know what he wants.

808
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:04,230
I'll bet he even tried
to buy it from you at some point.

809
01:30:05,649 --> 01:30:06,692
Go on.

810
01:30:06,777 --> 01:30:08,860
He has a case, he has codes.

811
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:12,907
But they're worthless
without a tactical satellite.

812
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:15,326
I want to know where he'd get it.

813
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:19,497
A man with information like that
would be a potential terrorist.

814
01:30:20,414 --> 01:30:22,373
And to your government,

815
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:26,545
a potential terrorist is a terrorist.

816
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:30,507
If you help me,

817
01:30:31,842 --> 01:30:34,845
my friends become your friends.

818
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:39,140
Sorry.

819
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,103
I cannot help you.

820
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:50,653
I certainly cannot tell you
that Russia quietly sold

821
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:54,532
an obsolete tactical satellite
to a certain telecom in Mumbai.

822
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:58,284
And whoever gave them that idea?

823
01:31:00,247 --> 01:31:02,163
An enterprising third party.

824
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:03,748
Working on commission.

825
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:07,086
Helping old friends. Making new ones.

826
01:31:07,753 --> 01:31:09,130
Can the satellite be shut down?

827
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,131
That would take special skills,

828
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:13,551
and you cannot do it alone.

829
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:41,537
What's in the bags?

830
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:42,997
It's our gear.

831
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:44,873
How'd you get it?

832
01:31:44,957 --> 01:31:46,125
Made a friend.

833
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:48,502
Well, I'm glad we could help.

834
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:50,378
You could help now.

835
01:31:50,462 --> 01:31:52,338
Look, Ethan, before we.. .

836
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:53,673
Whatever happened, happened.

837
01:31:54,216 --> 01:31:56,969
We still have a chance to clean this up,
but we have to do it now.

838
01:31:57,970 --> 01:32:00,180
And we have to do it together.

839
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:08,814
Okay. So, where are we going?

840
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:11,567
India.

841
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:16,613
-India? India?
-Sure.

842
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:17,780
Okay. Great.

843
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:22,953
Love the jet.

844
01:32:23,662 --> 01:32:25,456
Wait till you see the car.

845
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:55,819
You're also looking for a nuclear launch device
stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.

846
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:57,320
I am?

847
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:11,126
Brij Nath.

848
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:13,712
Brij Nath. Playboy. Multimedia tycoon.

849
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:16,756
On the surface,
his entire network is state-of-the-art.

850
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:18,759
But it's built on illegally acquired

851
01:33:18,842 --> 01:33:22,720
Cold War cast-offs, including this,
the Novosti satellite.

852
01:33:22,805 --> 01:33:24,597
Hendricks needs it
to launch a nuclear strike,

853
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:27,184
and we have to shut it down
before he gets that chance.

854
01:33:27,269 --> 01:33:29,853
And to do that, we need to get
the access code from him.

855
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:31,271
One way or another.

856
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:34,065
And if I don't,

857
01:33:35,025 --> 01:33:36,568
none of this works.

858
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:38,988
You can do this.

859
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:40,197
Yeah.

860
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,826
A week ago, I would have believed you.

861
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:51,457
I don't blame you for what happened.

862
01:33:56,213 --> 01:33:59,882
She took someone you cared about.
That's not something you just

863
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,301
let go.

864
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:05,180
Did it make you feel better?

865
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:10,601
When you killed the men
who killed your wife?

866
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:20,570
We can't get them back.

867
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:28,203
Okay, to shut down the satellite,

868
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:31,081
we have to manually tap into
the central server.

869
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:34,792
You'll enter through the exhaust vent,
wearing this under your suit.

870
01:34:34,877 --> 01:34:37,503
Drop down into the computer array,
and I'll catch you,

871
01:34:37,588 --> 01:34:40,923
then move you along the relay room
and you jack into the panel.

872
01:34:44,595 --> 01:34:47,180
Okay, so we enter the party
separately as guests.

873
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,057
Ethan quarterbacks while Jane.. .

874
01:34:49,141 --> 01:34:50,641
Gets the codes from the billionaire.

875
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:52,770
I switch off the fan,
you jump into the computer array,

876
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:54,896
and I catch you,
you plug in the transmitter

877
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:58,649
then Ethan feeds me the codes which I
then use to pinpoint Hendricks' location.

878
01:34:58,734 --> 01:35:01,904
Okay, but you just breezed over
something I think is really important.

879
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:04,823
The computer array part, where I just.. .

880
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:06,908
Jump?

881
01:35:07,743 --> 01:35:09,369
-And I catch you.
-Yeah.

882
01:35:09,453 --> 01:35:11,204
I don't. .. Why is that so hard to grasp?

883
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,914
Well. ..

884
01:35:12,998 --> 01:35:17,711
Why? It's a 25-foot drop.
And we're using magnets.

885
01:35:17,796 --> 01:35:19,128
Yeah.

886
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:22,966
In light of our recent efforts,
the technology's. ..

887
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:25,010
The science is sound. All right?

888
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:26,720
I'd be more worried about the heat.

889
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:30,140
And then there's that. What heat?

890
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,141
Well, it's like any computer, isn't it?

891
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:35,229
If you switch off the fan,
it's gonna get really hot!

892
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:36,396
Of course.

893
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,106
Relatively, you know.

894
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:43,112
Of course it will. So I'm jumping into a. ..

895
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:47,490
An oven, essentially.

896
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:49,784
Yeah. Essentially.

897
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:52,287
But I'll catch you.

898
01:35:54,164 --> 01:35:55,332
Great.

899
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:26,529
Aapka swagat hai, sir. Welcome, sir.

900
01:37:18,207 --> 01:37:19,582
Comm check.

901
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:22,961
Saturn's got your five-by-five, Jupiter.

902
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:26,088
This is Pluto.

903
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:30,344
I have arrived at the party.

904
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:34,765
There he is.

905
01:37:46,985 --> 01:37:48,612
Get us that code.

906
01:37:57,287 --> 01:37:59,081
Venus moving in on target.

907
01:38:10,926 --> 01:38:12,261
Hook's in.

908
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:16,305
You do make an impression.

909
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:21,310
Why am I Pluto?

910
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:23,229
It's not even a planet anymore.

911
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:25,064
Well, I think Uranus is available.

912
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:27,442
It's funny 'cause you said "anus."

913
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:42,832
I'm in position.

914
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:45,210
Sending in the Rover.

915
01:38:49,841 --> 01:38:51,048
He's moving to you.

916
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:52,842
Give him your back.

917
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:55,345
Don't want to make it too easy for him.

918
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:56,930
Are you gonna be talking
the whole time?

919
01:38:58,099 --> 01:39:01,475
In 20 minutes, I want a glass of
Cuvée Louis in every guest's hand.

920
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,563
And make sure all of them have a bottle
to take home by the end of the night.

921
01:39:04,646 --> 01:39:05,730
Sure.

922
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:10,569
Impressed yet?

923
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:13,404
I'm more of a bourbon girl.

924
01:39:19,578 --> 01:39:20,703
I'm Brij Nath.

925
01:39:21,204 --> 01:39:23,247
Welcome to my humble home.

926
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:47,396
And Rover's in position.

927
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:49,940
Spinning down the turbine.

928
01:39:58,117 --> 01:39:59,117
He's e-mailing.

929
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:01,328
Venus. Be Venus.

930
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:02,746
Be Venus.

931
01:40:11,046 --> 01:40:12,255
Husband?

932
01:40:12,923 --> 01:40:13,923
Boyfriend?

933
01:40:14,966 --> 01:40:16,301
More of a

934
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:18,261
co-worker.

935
01:40:19,055 --> 01:40:21,055
Saturn, take the leap.

936
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:26,770
Okay.

937
01:40:30,733 --> 01:40:32,192
Jumping.

938
01:40:32,275 --> 01:40:33,944
Jumping now.

939
01:40:36,322 --> 01:40:37,322
Jump now?

940
01:40:37,407 --> 01:40:39,448
Yes. Commit. Jump.

941
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:41,409
-Jump.
-Jump.

942
01:40:41,493 --> 01:40:43,412
-And I catch you.
-Now.

943
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:50,085
So, you're sure
about this suit, right, Benji?

944
01:40:50,168 --> 01:40:51,211
Pretty sure.

945
01:40:51,962 --> 01:40:54,756
Now you're pretty sure?

946
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:56,841
Jump.

947
01:40:57,969 --> 01:41:00,136
Oh, God. All right.

948
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:02,139
Jump.

949
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:04,599
Jump!

950
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:25,203
Jupiter, he's gone.

951
01:41:29,708 --> 01:41:30,708
Did you jump?

952
01:41:30,792 --> 01:41:32,668
Should I not have jumped?

953
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:34,671
'Cause I jumped!

954
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:38,257
Stand by.

955
01:41:46,266 --> 01:41:47,768
I'm playing a hunch.

956
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:50,311
Don't hit me.

957
01:42:07,704 --> 01:42:08,747
Hello?

958
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:10,582
My God, you are

959
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:12,792
a passionate creature.

960
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:17,671
I would like to show you
my collection of art.

961
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:20,175
I was waiting for you to ask.

962
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:22,010
Then you have to find me.

963
01:42:22,094 --> 01:42:23,302
You're on.

964
01:42:23,386 --> 01:42:25,555
I'm heading upstairs.

965
01:42:43,365 --> 01:42:44,865
All right, now be careful,

966
01:42:44,951 --> 01:42:47,159
because it's probably getting a bit hot.

967
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:49,578
We have to get to that satellite
before Hendricks does.

968
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:07,346
Look left. Look up.

969
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:10,100
I find your capricious passion intriguing.

970
01:43:11,435 --> 01:43:13,603
Let me tell you one thing.
He's not your type.

971
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:16,939
Completely not your type.
He's completely cold. I'm hot.

972
01:43:19,025 --> 01:43:21,485
Like all Indian men, I'm very hot.

973
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:22,529
Eight o'clock.

974
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:23,613
Hot! Very hot.

975
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:25,532
He's at your eight o'clock.

976
01:43:25,615 --> 01:43:27,951
As you move towards me,
you're getting hotter.

977
01:43:28,953 --> 01:43:31,872
Whoa. Up, up! Up, up!

978
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:34,416
Too much, too much, too much!

979
01:43:38,962 --> 01:43:40,296
I see you.

980
01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:45,551
I'd heard you have one of the finest
private collections in the world.

981
01:43:45,636 --> 01:43:48,220
Well, at the very least, it's private.

982
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:09,283
Saturn? How we doing
in the relay room?

983
01:44:09,368 --> 01:44:10,368
In position.

984
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:14,079
I see the satellite.

985
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,130
Can I help you, gentlemen?

986
01:44:22,213 --> 01:44:23,797
I don't think so.

987
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:31,680
Need those codes, guys.

988
01:44:40,565 --> 01:44:43,568
All originals from Chhatarpur District.

989
01:44:46,905 --> 01:44:49,114
You know, the Tantrics believe

990
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:55,454
that the Swadhisthana chakra hides
our most subconscious of desires.

991
01:45:47,425 --> 01:45:51,344
Uplink to satellite.
Reboot to original military specs.

992
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:53,430
Download the virus.

993
01:46:01,271 --> 01:46:05,524
What the hell is that?

994
01:46:05,609 --> 01:46:06,568
What the hell is what?

995
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:08,028
It's going haywire!

996
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:10,029
It's downloaded a virus
from the satellite.

997
01:46:10,113 --> 01:46:11,322
Hendricks is killing the server

998
01:46:11,407 --> 01:46:13,033
before we can kill the satellite.

999
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:15,201
Hendricks is reprogramming
the satellite.

1000
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:18,371
He's gonna have launch
capability in five minutes!

1001
01:46:18,456 --> 01:46:20,414
-Something wrong?
-No.

1002
01:46:21,082 --> 01:46:23,251
Jane, you gotta move.
We need that code.

1003
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:25,211
Finally we're alone.

1004
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:35,387
Venus, now's the time. Kick his ass

1005
01:46:35,472 --> 01:46:37,140
and get the code.

1006
01:46:37,475 --> 01:46:40,643
We are alone, aren't we?

1007
01:46:41,311 --> 01:46:43,979
No one will interrupt us.

1008
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:49,985
Move and I break your neck.

1009
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,654
The override sequence
for the relay station.

1010
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:55,033
Say it now or never speak again.

1011
01:46:56,034 --> 01:46:57,243
The codes.

1012
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:00,788
46, 82,

1013
01:47:01,664 --> 01:47:03,166
93.

1014
01:47:06,087 --> 01:47:07,087
Benji, what happened?

1015
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:08,921
The system's crashed! We're too late.

1016
01:47:09,006 --> 01:47:10,631
No, no, no. He's revealed himself.

1017
01:47:10,716 --> 01:47:12,341
Benji, can you pinpoint
Hendricks' location?

1018
01:47:13,551 --> 01:47:15,595
Hendricks is signaling out of a state-run

1019
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:17,555
TV station 6.7 miles from here.

1020
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:18,680
Send me the coordinates.

1021
01:47:18,765 --> 01:47:20,432
Good work, Brandt.
Now get the hell out of there.

1022
01:47:20,518 --> 01:47:21,600
Back me up!

1023
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:23,770
Jane, tie it off with Nath
and meet me at the rally point.

1024
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:33,904
Faster, Benji! Just straight through!

1025
01:47:38,034 --> 01:47:39,409
Wait! Stop!

1026
01:47:39,494 --> 01:47:40,994
Take me through!

1027
01:47:41,079 --> 01:47:44,082
It's not responding! A little bit of
patience would be appreciated!

1028
01:47:59,765 --> 01:48:01,640
I can't reach the top!

1029
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:05,435
More fan! More fan!

1030
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,895
More fan!

1031
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:08,856
There's nothing I can do! It's maxed out!

1032
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:28,751
Brandt?

1033
01:48:30,296 --> 01:48:33,631
Next time, I get to seduce the rich guy.

1034
01:48:44,435 --> 01:48:46,685
Satellite weaponized and online.

1035
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:49,146
Upload the new authentication codes.

1036
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:51,190
Lock Russian Central Command
out of the system.

1037
01:48:51,609 --> 01:48:53,025
Isolate the sub.

1038
01:48:53,109 --> 01:48:57,779
We'll fire just one missile,
an apparent retaliation for the Kremlin.

1039
01:48:58,282 --> 01:49:00,073
That should start the ball rolling.

1040
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:01,242
I'm here, Ethan.

1041
01:49:01,327 --> 01:49:03,411
How long until Hendricks
can launch a missile?

1042
01:49:04,454 --> 01:49:05,704
Less than 30 seconds!

1043
01:49:07,498 --> 01:49:09,375
We need another route.

1044
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:12,127
Turn left up ahead,
take the alley on the right.

1045
01:49:27,394 --> 01:49:28,394
We have uplink.

1046
01:49:39,113 --> 01:49:41,698
Ethan, Hendricks
has started the launch sequence.

1047
01:49:41,783 --> 01:49:43,451
How much time until missiles are flying?

1048
01:49:43,534 --> 01:49:44,786
Three minutes!

1049
01:49:48,539 --> 01:49:50,041
We're three and a half minutes out.

1050
01:49:53,503 --> 01:49:57,340
We can make it.

1051
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:22,198
Cease all further communication.

1052
01:50:25,786 --> 01:50:26,994
Next left.

1053
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:04,990
Ethan? We're too late.

1054
01:51:05,074 --> 01:51:07,076
The missile's in the air.

1055
01:51:19,465 --> 01:51:21,215
There has to be a way
to abort the warhead.

1056
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:23,051
If there is one,
it'll be on the launch device.

1057
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:24,510
We're gonna get that case.

1058
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:37,774
May there be peace on Earth.

1059
01:51:42,779 --> 01:51:44,404
Disable the relay.

1060
01:51:45,783 --> 01:51:47,867
Get Wistrom! Inside, inside!

1061
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:24,237
Wistrom destroyed the relay.

1062
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,529
Ethan went after Hendricks
and the case, but.. .

1063
01:52:25,613 --> 01:52:27,823
Doesn't matter if he has the case.
We can't transmit the abort codes.

1064
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:29,117
Can you fix it?

1065
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:31,911
Yeah.. . It's gonna be pointless
if we don't have any power.

1066
01:52:31,994 --> 01:52:32,994
Wistrom!

1067
01:52:35,082 --> 01:52:36,748
-Jane!
-I'm okay.

1068
01:52:38,502 --> 01:52:40,795
No, you are not okay. She's hit.

1069
01:52:41,212 --> 01:52:42,796
You stay here and cover Benji.

1070
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:45,882
Benji, get this thing rewired
and back online. I'll get the power on.

1071
01:52:45,967 --> 01:52:47,510
We can do this.

1072
01:56:01,912 --> 01:56:04,707
I'm taking that briefcase!

1073
01:56:08,252 --> 01:56:09,753
No! No!

1074
01:56:57,051 --> 01:56:58,511
He's been gone too long.

1075
01:56:58,595 --> 01:57:00,054
Damn it! Listen.

1076
01:57:00,137 --> 01:57:03,099
When the power comes on,
these two drives go into this bay, okay?

1077
01:57:47,101 --> 01:57:49,729
Mission accomplished!

1078
01:58:39,112 --> 01:58:40,945
This one is mine.

1079
01:58:53,083 --> 01:58:55,877
So, we are not enemies.

1080
01:58:57,797 --> 01:59:00,507
The phone call
from that arms dealer in Dubai.

1081
01:59:00,801 --> 01:59:02,384
You wanted me to find you.

1082
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:08,474
How else to believe this?

1083
01:59:16,106 --> 01:59:17,106
Hospital?

1084
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:21,444
And in other news, eight weeks later,

1085
01:59:21,529 --> 01:59:23,113
the debate continues.

1086
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:27,534
Eyewitnesses remain adamant
that the object was some sort of aircraft,

1087
01:59:27,618 --> 01:59:31,454
but officials with the Department of
Defense insist it was simply a meteor

1088
01:59:31,539 --> 01:59:34,250
large enough to be
visible during daylight.

1089
01:59:34,501 --> 01:59:36,417
You actually said that.

1090
01:59:36,752 --> 01:59:38,045
Out loud.

1091
01:59:38,671 --> 01:59:40,088
"Mission accomplished."

1092
01:59:40,172 --> 01:59:41,215
I said it.

1093
01:59:41,298 --> 01:59:43,842
You're still corny, Ethan.

1094
01:59:43,926 --> 01:59:46,761
I can't imagine
the look on that guy's face.

1095
01:59:48,556 --> 01:59:50,599
-Hey.
-This must be them.

1096
01:59:50,684 --> 01:59:53,978
Luther Stickell,
the firm of Carter, Dunn and Brandt.

1097
01:59:55,604 --> 01:59:59,440
I blew an entire weekend
on the bottom of the San Francisco Bay

1098
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:02,528
no thanks to you clowns.

1099
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:06,448
No, man, you know I got this.

1100
02:00:07,449 --> 02:00:09,952
I know. I'll see you in Kandahar.

1101
02:00:13,747 --> 02:00:15,875
Thanks for meeting me.

1102
02:00:15,958 --> 02:00:18,252
So, I hear the insurance
company's refusing

1103
02:00:18,336 --> 02:00:20,546
to pay the claim
on that car you crashed, Ethan.

1104
02:00:20,630 --> 02:00:24,257
Something about intentional 100-meter
vertical drops not being covered.

1105
02:00:24,341 --> 02:00:25,509
Go figure.

1106
02:00:29,096 --> 02:00:30,722
How's the leg?

1107
02:00:30,806 --> 02:00:32,056
Still working.

1108
02:00:32,975 --> 02:00:34,018
You?

1109
02:00:34,435 --> 02:00:35,644
Healing.

1110
02:00:37,521 --> 02:00:38,689
I'm fine, by the way.

1111
02:00:40,024 --> 02:00:41,692
I mean, I'm not actually sleeping, per se.

1112
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:44,819
You know. Cold sweats.
Middle of the night.

1113
02:00:46,488 --> 02:00:49,073
All these people
are just happy and smiling

1114
02:00:49,158 --> 02:00:50,909
and they are completely
oblivious to the fact

1115
02:00:50,993 --> 02:00:53,078
that they were almost vaporized.

1116
02:00:54,163 --> 02:00:55,788
And if it hadn't been for. ..

1117
02:00:55,873 --> 02:00:57,207
Dumb luck?

1118
02:00:57,667 --> 02:00:58,667
Was it?

1119
02:01:00,127 --> 02:01:03,631
I mean, look,
we were unprepared, in the dark.

1120
02:01:04,131 --> 02:01:05,466
Disavowed.

1121
02:01:06,676 --> 02:01:08,469
And the only thing
that functioned properly

1122
02:01:09,386 --> 02:01:10,930
on that mission

1123
02:01:11,847 --> 02:01:13,349
was this team.

1124
02:01:15,435 --> 02:01:18,020
I don't know how we ended up together,

1125
02:01:19,814 --> 02:01:21,230
but I'm glad we did.

1126
02:01:28,698 --> 02:01:29,907
Your missions.

1127
02:01:30,867 --> 02:01:32,701
Choose to accept them.

1128
02:01:38,291 --> 02:01:39,958
Hey, look, I'm in.

1129
02:01:40,335 --> 02:01:41,918
Seriously. It's not as if any mission

1130
02:01:42,002 --> 02:01:44,128
is gonna be rougher
than the last one, is it?

1131
02:01:45,547 --> 02:01:46,798
I mean, that's just.. .

1132
02:01:46,882 --> 02:01:48,550
Bomb. .. Is it?

1133
02:02:06,903 --> 02:02:08,237
Thanks, Ethan.

1134
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:09,738
Thank you.

1135
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:12,740
Agent Hunt.

1136
02:02:12,826 --> 02:02:14,201
Agent Carter.

1137
02:02:22,793 --> 02:02:23,836
Brandt.

1138
02:02:27,506 --> 02:02:29,007
I'm not picking up that phone, Ethan,

1139
02:02:29,091 --> 02:02:31,719
because I don't think
you want me in the field.

1140
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,640
I know your wife is dead.

1141
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:41,020
I was there in Croatia.

1142
02:02:42,771 --> 02:02:44,230
I was there for one reason.

1143
02:02:44,314 --> 02:02:45,481
One.

1144
02:02:46,275 --> 02:02:47,734
And I failed.

1145
02:02:52,282 --> 02:02:53,865
It was my job to protect her.

1146
02:02:54,576 --> 02:02:56,034
How do you know she's dead?

1147
02:02:59,413 --> 02:03:00,456
There was a body.

1148
02:03:00,957 --> 02:03:02,166
Did you see it?

1149
02:03:05,878 --> 02:03:07,921
You killed those Serbians.

1150
02:03:08,006 --> 02:03:09,047
I had to get her back.

1151
02:03:09,131 --> 02:03:10,716
You were sent to Rankow Prison.

1152
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,592
That was a sacrifice
I was willing to make.

1153
02:03:12,676 --> 02:03:15,470
IMF suspected Hendricks
had people in Rankow.

1154
02:03:18,182 --> 02:03:20,809
And six dead Serbians
was the ideal cover.

1155
02:03:22,686 --> 02:03:24,520
Waste not, want not.

1156
02:03:41,538 --> 02:03:43,664
The Secretary never told me.

1157
02:03:46,961 --> 02:03:50,797
I accepted the Rankow Prison mission
on one condition :

1158
02:03:50,881 --> 02:03:53,091
That no one could know
she was still alive.

1159
02:03:54,676 --> 02:03:56,970
But you're telling me.

1160
02:04:05,020 --> 02:04:07,605
When did you find out
that I was in Croatia?

1161
02:04:08,274 --> 02:04:10,234
I pulled your file after India.

1162
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:12,319
Right.

1163
02:04:14,279 --> 02:04:16,823
So you had to fake your wife's death.

1164
02:04:17,658 --> 02:04:21,036
As long as we were together,
she could never be safe.

1165
02:04:21,996 --> 02:04:24,789
It wasn't your job to protect her, Brandt.

1166
02:04:27,292 --> 02:04:28,543
It's mine.

1167
02:04:30,712 --> 02:04:31,838
Okay.

1168
02:04:35,801 --> 02:04:37,051
So we're good.

1169
02:04:38,387 --> 02:04:39,720
We're good.

1170
02:05:39,448 --> 02:05:41,199
Come on!

1171
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:02,304
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

1172
02:06:02,387 --> 02:06:06,682
36 hours ago, there was a breach
in our military's communication network.

1173
02:06:06,809 --> 02:06:10,270
Now, an emerging terror
organization known as The Syndicate

1174
02:06:10,354 --> 02:06:14,024
has control of our entire drone fleet.
Their targets: Unknown.

1175
02:06:14,317 --> 02:06:17,027
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it.. .
