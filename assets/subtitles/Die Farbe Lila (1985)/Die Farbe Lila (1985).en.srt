Celie! Nettie!
Come back to the house now.

5
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,811
Girls, your mama got supper.

6
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:19,407
Celie, you got the ugliest smile
this side of Creation.

7
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,479
Ain't you done yet?

8
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,334
A girl!

9
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:37,234
No.

10
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,031
- I want it.
- Shh. Celie.

11
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,117
Nettie!

12
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,375
You better not tell nobody but God.

13
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,835
It'd kill your mama.

14
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:07,014
Dear God, I'm 1 4 years old.

15
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,309
I've always been a good girl.

16
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,896
Maybe you can give me a sign.

17
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,315
Let me know what's happening to me.

18
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:24,323
One day, my daddy come and say,
"You gonna do what your mama wouldn't."

19
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:28,536
Now, I got two children by my daddy.

20
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:33,833
A baby boy called Adam,
he took while I was sleeping...

21
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,920
...and a baby girl called Olivia...

22
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,923
...that he took right out of my arms.

23
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,302
Then my mama died...

24
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,097
...cussing and screaming...

25
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,933
...because her heart been broke.

26
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,953
Dear God, he act like he can't stand me no more.

27
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,331
I don't think he killed my baby boy.

28
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:20,463
I heard he sold it to a preacher and his wife.

29
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,638
I keep hoping he'll find somebody to marry.

30
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,974
I seen him looking at my little sister.

31
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,809
She's scared.

32
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,813
But I say, "I'll take care of you,
with God's help."

33
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,696
- Come on! Push!
- Hurry up! Hurry!

34
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,992
- Come on, guys!
- Hurry up!

35
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,078
Shh! Shh!

36
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:58,667
Dear God, he come home with a girl
from around the town called Gray.

37
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,630
She be almost my age,
but they getting married now.

38
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,052
My little sister, Nettie, has got
a man always looking at her.

39
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,807
His wife's dead. She was killed by her
boyfriend, coming home from church.

40
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,142
He got three children.

41
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,269
He seen Nettie in church.

42
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,690
Now every Sunday evening, here come Mister.

43
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:26,320
It is therefore not to be
entered into lightly or unadvisedly...

44
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:32,284
...but reverently and soberly
and in the fear of God. Let us pray.

45
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:37,206
Dear Lord, we ask your blessing
on our brother, Harris!

46
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,834
Amen!

47
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,752
Amen!

48
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,229
I want to marry your Nettie.

49
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,984
I got to have somebody right now.

50
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,571
I got nobody to watch over my young ones.

51
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:13,200
They be fighting and bleeding
and throwing up on the floor...

52
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,995
...while I got a farm to run.

53
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,375
I'll take right good care of your Nettie.

54
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,963
I can't let you have Nettie.
She too young.

55
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,218
But I tell you what.
I can let you have Celie.

56
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,971
She oldest and should marry first.

57
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,766
She ain't fresh, but I expect you know that.

58
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,769
She's spoiled, twice.

59
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,398
Celie is ugly but she works hard,
and she can Iearn.

60
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,066
And God fixed her.

61
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,404
You can do what you like.
She won't make you feed or clothe it.

62
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:55,910
But Nettie, you flat out can't have.
Not now, not never.

63
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:02,499
Well, I ain't never Iooked
at the other one before.

64
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,002
Let me see her again.

65
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,088
Celie, Mister want another look at you.

66
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,677
Move up. He won't bite.

67
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,062
Turn around.

68
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,364
What you doing that for?

69
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,783
Your sister's thinking about marriage.

70
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,805
How come y'all standing
out here. What you waiting on?

71
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,060
- This here's your new mammy.
- She ain't my mammy.

72
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,480
Harpo! Come here!

73
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,400
Harpo! Get here! Come here, boy!

74
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,156
Come here. Come here.

75
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,160
Harpo! Don't you run from me, boy!

76
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,888
I don't cry.

77
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:44,935
I laid there thinking about Nettie
while he on top of me.

78
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,230
Wonder if she's safe.

79
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,318
Then I think about
that pretty woman in the picture.

80
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,239
I know what he doing to me, he done to her.

81
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,616
And maybe she like it.

82
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,497
Jesus!

83
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,272
Harpo, didn't I tell you to clean my saddle?

84
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,066
I did do it, Pa.

85
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,194
Look at the mold on the side.

86
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:21,365
Look at the dirt on it.
This don't look like it's clean.

87
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,743
The new mule had it on. Joey, had it.
I couldn't get it from him.

88
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,829
- He was biting and kicking on it.
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

89
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,623
When's the last time their hair was combed?

90
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,875
Not since their mammy did it.

91
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,419
Go clean my saddle.

92
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,046
I'll have to shave it off.

93
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,842
No, no, no.
It's bad Iuck to cut a woman's hair.

94
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,844
This'll take all day.

95
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,555
Shut up!

96
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,015
- I can't. It hurts her.
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

97
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,487
- Ahh!
- Don't talk back to me.

98
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,205
You do what I tell you.

99
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:34,605
Dear God, I seen my baby girl.

100
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,398
I know it was her.

101
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,692
She looked just like me and my daddy.

102
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,862
Like more us than us is ourself.

103
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,324
My little girl looks like
she fretting over something.

104
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,702
She got my eyes, just like they is today.

105
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,789
Like everything I see, she's seeing.

106
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,918
How are you today?

107
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,254
Thank you.

108
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,137
That's real pretty.

109
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,932
Yes. I'm making me
and my little girl a new dress.

110
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,392
Her daddy will be so pleased.

111
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,186
Who her daddy?

112
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,938
Mr. Samuel.

113
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,191
Mr. Samuel. Who he?

114
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,276
The reverend Mr. Samuel.

115
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,571
You want that cloth or not?
We got other customers.

116
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,950
Yes, sir. I want five yards, sir.

117
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,663
- You want something, gal?
- No, sir!

118
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,293
How long you had your little girl?

119
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,296
She be seven months on the fifteenth.

120
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,385
Can I hold her?

121
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,971
If you like.

122
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,765
Watch her head now. Be careful.

123
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,809
There you go.

124
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,692
I think she mine.

125
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,236
My heart say she mine.

126
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,488
But I don't know if she mine.

127
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,741
If she my baby, her name Olivia.

128
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,204
I stitch "Olivia" on all the seat
of her diapers.

129
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:18,250
I stitch a lot of little flowers and stars too.

130
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,086
He took all the diapers when he took her.

131
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,546
What's her name?

132
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,840
Pauline.

133
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,177
But I calls her Olivia.

134
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,681
- Come on, sweetie. Come on.
- Olivia.

135
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,642
- Come on. Come on.
- Olivia.

136
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,453
Olivia.

137
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:49,197
Whys you call her Olivia
when that ain't her name?

138
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,534
Don't she look Iike an Olivia to you?

139
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,079
Just look at those eyes.

140
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,041
Only somebody old would have eyes like that.

141
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,376
So I call her Ole Livia.

142
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,595
Well, nice talking to you.

143
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,056
My husband's waiting.

144
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,069
You gonna buy anything or not, gal?

145
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,971
Whoa, whoa.

146
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,268
I thank you, sir.

147
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,313
- Give these to Mr. Johnson.
- Yes, sir.

148
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,778
Nettie!

149
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,864
Celie!

150
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,535
Nettie!

151
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,205
Celie!

152
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,877
I'm so glad to see you!

153
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,173
I just couldn't keep him off me.
Could I stay here with you?

154
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,195
Can Nettie stay with us for a spell?

155
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,788
Sure. She be kin now.

156
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,227
What happened with you and Pa?

157
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,521
I just couldn't keep him off me.

158
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:30,650
He'd try everything.
You know how he is.

159
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,694
I ain't never going back there!

160
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,698
You hear what I say? I'd die first, Celie.

161
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,826
Hush now!

162
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:43,830
Don't let them run over you.
Show them who's got the upper hand.

163
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,290
They got it.

164
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,834
You got to fight, Celie. You got to.

165
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,086
I don't know how to fight.

166
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,924
All I know how to do is stay alive.

167
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,554
You sure look pretty today, Nettie.

168
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,350
Celie, my boy be needing his supper.

169
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,316
Sure is a pretty dress you have on.

170
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,904
Oh, Nettie, you have such nice skin...

171
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,490
...and such soft, beautiful hair.

172
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,995
And you smell so good
when I sit close to you. And your teeth....

173
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,164
He talk about your teeth?

174
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,750
Yeah, about how bright they shine.

175
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:37,801
Celie! My boy wants supper. The kitchen
needs cleaning. The cow needs milking.

176
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:41,513
My shirt needs mending. My pants
need fixing. My shoes need shining.

177
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,807
My children need feeding.

178
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,934
And when you're tired...

179
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:49,020

We could write.

186
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,124
- Can you read good?
- I can't say that I do.

187
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,459

215
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:59,192
Like how we hang the sheets

00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:39,535
Where's my black tie?
I mean the yellow one with black in it!

312
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,287
It's in there.

313
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:43,998
I don't see it!
Where's my suit pin?

314
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,333
- In the drawer.
- Is it on the shelf?

315
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,044
Uh-huh.

316
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,006
Is it the right side or the left side?
The left side?

317
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,883
The left.

318
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,178
Is this the right vest for my suit?

319
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,847
Shit.

320
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:02,516
Where's my blue--
Oh, here it is.

00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,698
I like the black one.

323
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,970
Oh, no.

324
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,902
I hate this tie!
It don't go with nothing I got on!

325
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,029

326
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,199

327
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:22,429
Hyah! Come on, come on. Hyah!

328
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,949
She said she write, but she never write.

329
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,953
She said only death could keep her from me.

330
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,622
Maybe she dead.

331
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,802

Looks like you got yourself in trouble.

342
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:45,346
I ain't in no trouble.

343
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,556
Big, though.

344
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,308
Who the daddy?

345
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,310

346
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,437
How does he know that?

347
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,690
He knows because he the only one!

348
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,363
Celie, get me some lemonade.

349
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,783

Got their legs open for every Tom,
Dick and Harpo.

351
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:23,050
Don't think I'll let my boy marry you
just because you in the family way.

352
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,969
Ain't cold enough.

353
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,974
He young and limited. Pretty gal Iike you
could put anything over on him.

354
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:36,605
Why I need to marry Harpo?
He living here with you.

355
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:40,067
What food and clothes he get, you buy.

356
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:45,364
I know your daddy throwed you out.
Ready to live in the street.

357
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:49,994
No, sir, I ain't living in no streets.

358
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,746
I'm living with my sister and her husband.

359
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:56,583
I can live with them
the rest of my life if I want to.

360
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:01,005
I don't need you to tell me how
to take care of me and my baby.

361
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,758
I can take care of my baby myself.
Nice visiting.

362
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,302
No, you stay right here, Harpo.

363
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,515
When you free, me and the baby be waiting.

364
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:21,233
Well, look like somebody around here
know how to treat a visitor.

365
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,739
Harpo, don't you move one step.

366
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,161
Just don't make me wait too long, Harpo.

367
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,667
Harpo?

368
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:40,961
Harpo!

369
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,132
I won't! I will! I will! I do.

370
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,425
I do!

371
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:47,634
I do.

372
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,428
Now, Sofia.

373
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,431
Do you take this man to be your
lawful wedded husband?

374
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:57,686
To love, honor and cherish?
Forsaking all others for him alone...

375
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:01,106
...you will perform unto him
all duties owes to a husband...

376
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,817
...until death shall separate you?

377
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,652
I do!

378
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,239
You may now salute the bride.

379
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,116
Amen!

380
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:21,835
I's married now!
I's a married woman!

381
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,453
I declare....

382
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,170
Come on, push now. Push now.

383
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:10,175
I been needing so many curtains,
but I ain't had time.

384
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,719
You children, get out of this yard.
Go on home!

385
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,223
Harpo, come on down here.
I need you to hold this baby.

386
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,432
I'm busy!

387
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,352
Busy making a racket.
Now come on down here!

388
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,565
Damn, Sofia! I'll come down
when I'm good and ready!

389
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:31,155
I tell you the truth! It is!

390
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,033
Child, we're going to get you a little milk.

391
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:38,620
A little milk for the baby.
Yes, indeed.

392
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,914
Here. Go to your daddy.

393
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,332
What should I do with it?

394
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,378
Try feeding her, then fix up the mess
you done made here.

395
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,380
I can smell the rain coming.

396
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:53,302
Miss Celie, we got ourselves some
new curtains I want to put in the bedroom.

397
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,930
The living room
has already got itself some flowers.

398
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,849
What you looking at?

399
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,351
It's gonna rain on your head!

400
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,396
You ever hit her?

401
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,357
No, sir.

402
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,444
How you expect her to mind?
Heh, heh.

403
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,238
Wives is like children.

404
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,617
You have to let them know
who got the upper hand.

405
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,621
Nothing can do it better than a good beating.

406
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,791
Sofia thinks too much of herself.

407
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,252
Needs to be taken down a peg or two.

408
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,636
Got a new baby and it cry all night long.

409
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,347
Kept him up so he said he wasn't going to work.

410
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:42,351
She got all upset but I said,
"Leave the man alone.

411
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,437
Sometimes a man just needs
to be left alone."

412
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,939
I need something to eat!

413
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,651
Pie's in the pantry. Women need
to be left alone sometimes.

414
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,654
I tell Harpo when I'm fussing,
"Leave me alone!"

415
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,573
- Ain't you gonna get it for me?
- What's the matter with you?

416
00:42:57,951 --> 00:43:00,661
That's my own baby crying. Lord.

417
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,831
Make yourself useful, Harpo.
Hush now, honey.

418
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:14,341
What am I gonna do about Sofia?

419
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,519
Beat her.

420
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,119
You told Harpo to beat me!

421
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:48,041
It was that mule, Old Joey.
Old Joey, the mule.

422
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,670
I was plowing the north field
and the mule went crazy.

423
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,841
He started kicking.
Busted my eye and my lip.

424
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:58,510
All my life I had to fight.

425
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:02,764
I had to fight my daddy,
I had to fight my uncles.

426
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,225
I had to fight my brothers.

427
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,812
Girl child ain't safe in a family of mens.

428
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,982
But I never thought I had to fight
in my own house!

429
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,486
I loves Harpo.

430
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,072
God knows I do.

431
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:23,660
But I'll kill him dead before I let him beat me!

432
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:27,080
- That's a hoof print.
- No, that look like a fist print.

433
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:30,208
No, sir. Ain't no fist touched my face.
No, sir.

434
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,420
You want a dead son-in-law, Miss Celie?

435
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,631
You keep on advising him like you doing.

436
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:42,220
This life be over soon.
Heaven lasts always.

437
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:46,600
You should bash Mister's head open
and think about Heaven later.

438
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,956
Sofia beat on Harpo.

439
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,209
Then Harpo beat on Sofia.

440
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,462
And then Sofia beat on Harpo some more.

441
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,174
In between the beatings,
the children keep coming.

442
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:28,767
And then one day, Sofia can't take it no more.

443
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,977
And good riddance!

444
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:49,204
Bye, Clarence!

445
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:52,332
Bye, Emma! Bye, Ruby!

446
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,752
Bye, Sofia! Bye!

447
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,261
Nettie.

448
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:26,241
- Morning, Mr. Huntley!
- Whoa.

449
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,701
Morning, Mr. Johnson.

450
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:31,705
I brung you some fresh-baked cookies
made in my stove!

451
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:35,167
- Thank you. They look good.
- Bring the plate back tomorrow.

452
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,641
Now giddyup! Giddyup!

453
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,647
Have a fine day, Mr. Huntley!
And keep the plate!

454
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,238
Anything come for me?

455
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,971
Dear God, today was a peculiar day.

456
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:33,975
I was sitting on the porch
reading to the kids...

457
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,312
...when all of a sudden,
something struck me.

458
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,273
I got up and looked at the sky.

459
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:43,235
It was dark and there wasn't nothing moving.

460
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:49,449
I got down off the porch to see what
was coming. It felt like twister weather.

461
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:53,703
I didn't see nothing.
But I know something's there.

462
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,207
Yes, indeed, Lord.
I know something's coming.

463
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:30,532
Pa! Who that, Pa? Who this?

464
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,576
Pa, who this?

465
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,662
The woman that should have been your mammy.

466
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,038
Shug Avery?

467
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:40,417
Give me a hand and get her in the house.

468
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:44,045
Celie! Help me get her in the house.

469
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,508
Celie! Damn it! Get here!

470
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,766
Celie!

471
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,444
Hey, Celie! Get here!

472
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:17,495
Celie, this Shug Avery, a friend
of the family. Fix up the spare room.

473
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,997
I can't move.

474
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:22,459
I can't move. I need to see her eyes.

475
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:26,004
I feel that once I see her eyes,
my feet can let go...

476
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,214
...of where they're stuck.

477
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,642
You sure is ugly!

478
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,939
Come on, now.

479
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:58,370
Turn loose my goddamn hand!

480
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,581
What's the matter with you? You crazy?

481
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:05,085
I don't need no weak Iittle boy...

482
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,380
...can't say no to his daddy,
hanging on me!

483
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:12,509
I need me a man! You hear?

484
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,761
A man!

485
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:27,023
And I don't want to smell
no goddamn stinking pipe, Albert!

486
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:34,614
Get that thing to make me something to eat.

487
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,325
No, no. I'll make it myself.

488
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,495
Albert?

489
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,461
Ahh! Shit!

490
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:57,804
Eggs. Skillet.
Why you put the pots up here?

491
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,014
Nobody can get to them.

492
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,573
Butter, butter, butter.

493
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,825
It's in the cooler, on the shelf.

494
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:23,830
- Butter? Butter!
- Huh?

495
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,750
In the cooler, on the shelf.

496
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,502
Albert.

497
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,677
Ain't warm enough.
How do you work this stove?

498
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,180
Ain't hot enough.

499
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:46,144
Can't even keep a stove burning good all day.

500
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,689
Can't even keep a oven hot!

501
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:52,025
You're useless sometimes!

502
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:58,364
Wood. Wood. Wood. Wood.

503
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,576
Ah.

504
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:08,583
Did you ever cook here?

505
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,381
It still ain't hot enough!

506
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:27,602
I'll get it hot.
I'll show you how to make it hot.

507
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,229
Yeah.

508
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:59,217
Mm-mm!

509
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:06,307
Baby, look what I brought you.

510
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,269
Mm!

511
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:13,648
Baby, have I got a surprise for you.
This'll make you all well.

512
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:17,026
This got burnt, but the eggs
are just the way you like them.

513
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,736
Are you trying to kill me?

514
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,115
No. Now, baby, don't be that way!

515
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:20,673
I told you, I don't want nothing!

516
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:27,972
I just stand back and wait to see
what the wall gonna look like.

517
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,809
See what kind of colors
Shug's gonna put on there now.

518
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:58,378
What you staring at?
Never seen a naked woman before?

519
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,755
You got any children?

520
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,548
Yes, ma'am.

521
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,634
"Yes, ma'am"? I ain't that old.

522
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,845
Two.

523
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,722
Where they at?

524
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,891
I don't know.

525
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,727
Who are you?

526
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,563
Celie, ma'am.

527
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,287
You ain't well.

528
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:37,750
Mind your own goddamn business.
I feel just fine. Just had to eat.

529
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:41,045
Now, put some more bubbling oil in this tub.

530
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,345
You got kids?

531
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,389
Yeah.

532
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,184
They with my ma and pa.

533
00:55:55,602 --> 00:56:01,607
Never knowed a child to come out right
unless there's a man around.

534
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,903
Children...

535
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,656
...got to have a pa.

536
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:14,287
Your pa love you?

537
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,125
My pa loved me.

538
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:21,878
My pa still loves me...

539
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,797
...except he don't know it.

540
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,884
He don't know it.

541
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:12,470
Hey, boy! Here, boy!

542
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,347
Nobody here to greet your pa?

543
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,393
Sure ain't nobody in the fields,
that's for sure.

544
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:03,354
Just couldn't rest till you got her
in your house, could you?

545
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:08,067
Cool drink?

546
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,736
Take your hat?

547
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,541
What is it with this Shug Avery?

548
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,128
She black as tar...

549
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:29,255
...nappy-headed....

550
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:33,467
She got Iegs like baseball bats.

551
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,596
Her own daddy won't have nothing to do with her.

552
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,099
Old Mister talking trash about Shug.

553
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:43,144
Folks don't like nobody
being too proud or too free.

554
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:46,856
She's no more than a jook-joint Jezebel.

555
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:49,650
She ain't even clean.

556
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:54,071
I hear she's got that nasty women's disease.

557
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:58,534
You ain't got it in you to understand.

558
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,621
I love Shug Avery.

559
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,123
Always have, always will.

560
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,918
Should've married her when I had a chance.

561
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,377
Yeah.

562
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:14,217
And throwed your life away. And a right
smart amount of money with it.

563
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:20,806
Plus, I hear all her children's
got different daddies.

564
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,478
It's all too trifling and confused.

565
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,774
All Shug's children got the same daddy.
I can vouch--

566
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:31,484
You can vouch for nothing!

567
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:37,907
Shug Avery done set the population
of Hartwell County a new high.

568
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:42,828
You just one of the roosters, boy.

569
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,586
Celie.

570
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,965
You has my sympathy.

571
00:59:55,008 --> 01:00:00,054
Ain't many women's allow their
husband's whore to lay up in their house.

572
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,139
Celie.

573
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:05,017
Hand Pa his hat.

574
01:00:57,738 --> 01:01:01,699
Next time, I'll put
a little Shug Avery pee in his glass...

575
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,909
...and see how he like that.

576
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:24,930
I ain't heard so much racket
since before Sofia left.

577
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,683
Every evening after he leave the field...

578
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,812
...he knocking down
and piling things up.

579
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,482
Sometime his friend Swain come by to help.

580
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,490
Hey, Harpo!

581
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:46,827
Swain! Ahh!

582
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,373
Two ofthem worked long way past supper.

583
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,876
Mister have to call and tell them
to shut up the racket.

584
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,881
What you doing?

585
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,383
Building a jook joint.

586
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,635
- Way back here?
- Yeah!

587
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:05,805
Jook joint's supposed to be
way back in the woods.

588
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,315
You never seen this before.

589
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,442
- Now you close your eyes.
- Keep your eyes closed.

590
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,236
I know what a cow looks like.

591
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:22,696
You ain't never seen a cow like this.

592
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,741
Yeah. Come on now! Come on.

593
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:30,746
Ready. One, two, three!

594
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,164
Ha, ha!

595
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:35,000
Look at that! Look at that!

596
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:50,141

Oh, sugar dumpling,
let me taste some! Aw, baby!

604
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:16,750
You can catch a fish without a hook, girl.

605
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:30,556
I like your uncle, Like your brother too

606
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,100
I did like your pappy But your pappy wouldn't do

607
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:36,061
I met your daddy On the corner the other day

608
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,731
You know about that That he was funny that way

609
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:41,609
Now he's a funny mistreater,
A robber and a cheater

610
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,403
Slip you in the dozens Your pappy's, your cousin

611
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:47,948
And your mama do the Lordy, Lord

612
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:10,429
Now God made him an elephant Made him stout

613
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:13,307
Wasn't satisfied till he made him a snout

614
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,560
Looks like Albert brought his maid.

615
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:21,524
Last time I saw that kind of hat
was at my mama's funeral.

616
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,235
Wasn't satisfied until He made him some eyes

617
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:26,946
Made him some eyes Just to lose on the ground

618
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:31,033
Wasn't satisfied till he made his yes, yes
Made his yes, yes, yes

619
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:32,826
Whoo!

620
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,120
Wasn't satisfied till he made him sick

621
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,957
Made him sick, Lord It made him well

622
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,459
You know about that The elephant caught hell

623
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:43,504
'Cause he's a dirty mistreater
A robber and a cheater

624
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:46,298
Slip you in your dozens Your papa's, your cousin

625
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:50,636
Mama, do the Lordy, Lord

626
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,600
Oh, Lordy, Lord!

627
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:04,525
There's only two kinds
of children in this world.

628
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:06,986
God's children and Satan's children.

629
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,905
Babylon ain't no far-off place
in the desert.

630
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:14,743
It's right here! Just a few hundred yards
from this holy place.

631
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,912
Whoo.

632
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:19,873
The song I'm about to sing...

633
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:24,169
...is called "Miss Celie's Blues."

634
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:32,386
Because she scratched it
out of my head when I was ailing.

635
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:11,759
Sister, you've been on my mind

636
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:16,889

But singing the blues

641
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:40,204
Oh, sister, have I got news for you

642
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:43,207

01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:18,492
So let me tell you something, sister

649
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:21,412

01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:26,834
No twister, Gonna steal your stuff away

651
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:30,129

Because honey this Shug Is feeling fine

655

I know you don't believe it,
but I used to live here.

656
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:13,714
This used to be my living room.
That was my kitchen.

657
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:16,675
Harpo run the doors and windows
from the creek to here.

658
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:19,511
Now, somewhere is my dining room.

659
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,224
Lord, look at who's here. It's Miss Celie.

660
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:28,353
Miss Celie, it sure is good to see you.

661
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,816
Pull up a chair. Have a cold drink.

662
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:37,196
I believes I want me some of this here.

663
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:42,034
I want to introduce y'all to my friend.
Henry Broadnax is his name.

664
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:45,871
Everybody call him Buster.
He's a good friend of the family.

665
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:48,040
How you doing? How you feel?

666
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:51,794
- Where are your children?
- At home. Where are yours?

667
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,212

You said it's our jook joint!

687
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:41,236
Can't a man dance with his wife?

688
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:43,739
Not if she left him.

689
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:48,744
Good night, y'all.

Come on, I don't want to have

01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:38,103
Lord, have mercy! Firemen ain't
gonna get it, somebody call the Iaw!

701
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,522
You can light a fire without a match.

702
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:44,943
You can catch a fish without a hook.
You can make a blind man see.

703
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,278
Oh!

704
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:48,905

Mister.

723
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,180
Why he do that?

724
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:51,570
He beat me for not being you.

725
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,431
I know he a bully...

726
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,935
...but there's some things
I love about him.

727
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,021
You still love him?

728
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,690
I got what you call a passion for him.

729
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:33,320
If I was ever going to have a husband,
he'd been it. But he weak.

730
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,822
Tell me the truth.

731
01:15:36,324 --> 01:15:38,366
Do you mind if Albert sleep with me?

01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,994
You Iike sleeping with him?

733
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:45,081
I have to confess, I love it. Don't you?

734
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:46,666
No.

735
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:49,920
No, most time I pretend I ain't even there.

736
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,339
He don't know the difference.

737
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:54,341
He don't never ask me how I feel.

738
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:57,469
He never ask me about myself.

739
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,555
He just climb on top of me and do his business.

740
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:03,099
"Do his business"?

741
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:08,605
You sound like he going to the toilet on you.

742
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:11,691
That's what it feel like.

743
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,404

Ohh! I'm driving!

833
01:26:50,581 --> 01:26:51,789
I'm driving.

834
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:55,501
Hey! Watch it!

01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,632

Whoo! Isn't that fun?

837
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:16,147
Dear God, after many years,
they let Sofia out of jail...

838
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:18,816
...just to put her in the next.

839
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:22,486
She ended up being Miss Millie's maid after all.

840
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:27,992
Mayor bought Miss Millie a car,
and she had Sofia teach her how to drive.

841
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:32,788
Poor Sofia, stuck with Miss Millie
for the rest of her life.

842
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:34,498
- We went past the store.
- Top the H.

843
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:38,044
I've got it. Top of the H.
Here we go.

844
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:50,806
Oh, my. That was exciting, wasn't it?

845
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:53,559
Yes, ma'am, I reckon it was.

846
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:57,813
Well, let's do the shopping!

847
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:03,277
Sofia, I need apples, raisins,
cinnamon, currants, lemons...

848
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:07,448
...crackers, brown sugar, oranges,
nutmeg, flour, salt, pepper...

849
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:10,701
...cloves, eggs, and some candy
for the children.

850
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:17,375
- How are you today?
- Nice to see you!

851
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:21,295
- Have a nice Christmas.
- Same to you.

852
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:25,049
I've been wondering about
starting a fund for the colored children.

853
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:26,634
It's a little late this year.

854
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:29,387
I meant to talk
to some of the shopkeepers about it.

855
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:30,805
We could do one next year.

856
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:36,644
Set up a fund so they could have some toys
and some clothes, a toy or two.

857
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:39,397
I started taking driving lessons.
Did you see me out there?

858
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:43,567
- Sofia's been teaching me how to drive.
- That's wonderful.

859
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:46,153
Have you ever thought about going to Mars?

860
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,155
I wonder what it's like.

861
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:51,242
They call it the red planet.
Does it look red?

862
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:57,581
- How are you doing today?
- Good to see you. Hello.

863
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:07,008
How do, Mr. Peters?
Look at me, I'm driving.

864
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,592
Yes, ma'am.

865
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:22,982
Sofia, I'm gonna drive you home tomorrow.

866
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:28,612
Did you hear what I said?
I'm gonna drive you home.

867
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,451
- Home?
- Yes, home.

868
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,162
You haven't seen your children in a while.

869
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:43,502
No, I ain't seen them in about eight years.

870
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:46,005
That's a shame.

871
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:52,261
Tomorrow's Christmas!
You can stay all day!

872
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:55,264
You can stay all day!

873
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:02,521
I will drive myself back.

874
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,242
Thank you.

875
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:54,865
That's your mama.

876
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,035
That's her.

877
01:31:04,543 --> 01:31:06,252
Go on.

878
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,698
Hi, my name is Emma.

879
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,285
I'm very pleased to meet you.

880
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,277
Sofia back!

881
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:19,283
- Sofia, I'll pick you up at 5:00.
- Yes, ma'am.

882
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:20,826
Come on.

883
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:49,605
Oh, Miss Sofia, it's so good to have you home.

884
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,108
Oh, yes.

885
01:32:53,652 --> 01:32:55,402
So good.

886
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:24,848
Mama, why are you crying?

887
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:29,311
Because I don't know y'all no more.

888
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:48,163
This is going to be a happy Christmas!

889
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:51,375
I can do it.
I can put it in reverse.

890
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:54,878
I can make it go the right way.
Come on. Ohh!

891
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:57,548
She can't get it out of reverse.

892
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:02,469
Mrs. Millie! Whoa, whoa!

893
01:34:08,268 --> 01:34:09,643
Take off your coat.

894
01:34:26,036 --> 01:34:27,745
Get away from me!

895
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:41,675
You get away from me!
Don't touch me!

896
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:45,637
- Don't you know who I am?
- Yes, ma'am.

897
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:49,224
- I've always been good to you people!
- We know that, ma'am.

898
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:50,768
Calm down.

899
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:53,812
- I am Miss Millie! I'm the mayor's wife!
- Yes, ma'am.

900
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:56,106
I've always been good to you people!

901
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:58,859
I've always gone out of my way for coloreds!

902
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:00,027
Yes, ma'am.

903
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:03,197
Miss Millie, what's the matter?

904
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:06,533
Those boys....

905
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,786
Those boys tried to attack me.

906
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:10,996
No such a thing.

907
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:16,835
How could you leave me alone for so Iong?

908
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:21,006
Come on now. Come on.

909
01:35:21,341 --> 01:35:23,926
What am I gonna do about the car?

910
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:29,723
Jack will drive you home, Miss Millie.

911
01:35:31,017 --> 01:35:35,979
I can't ride in a car
with some strange colored man.

912
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:41,985
I'll ask my sister Odessa to squeeze in.

913
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:45,155
That way I have more time with my children.

914
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:54,832
I don't know her either.

915
01:35:58,044 --> 01:36:00,045
Goodbye!

916
01:36:22,068 --> 01:36:23,694
It's Shug.

917
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:28,490
- Shug.
- Heh. Hot diggidy-dog!

918
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:32,327
I'm coming, Shug!

919
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:34,872
- It's sugarbaby!
- Hey, Shug!

920
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,221
Hey, Shug!

921
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,144
Albert!

922
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:01,648
Hey, Shug--

923
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:04,485
Oh! Miss Celie!

924
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:09,490
I've heard so much about you!
Feels like we old friends!

925
01:37:24,047 --> 01:37:25,506
This is Grady.

926
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:29,676
This is my husband.

927
01:37:31,471 --> 01:37:33,430
Us been driving all night.

928
01:37:33,723 --> 01:37:38,435
No place to stop. But here us is!
Well, how are you?

929
01:37:39,312 --> 01:37:41,188
We're fine.

930
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:43,273
Got colds though.

931
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:49,613
This here's my wedding present.
Brand new.

932
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:52,199
I want Albert to learn how to drive it.

933
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:55,494
Grady drive like a fool.
I thought the police would get us.

934
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:59,665
Us two married Iadies now.
Two married ladies, and hungry!

935
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:01,750
What us got to eat?

936
01:38:12,178 --> 01:38:14,972
Yeah, you know, Grady, we done had the best.

937
01:38:17,267 --> 01:38:20,477
- It's true.
- Yeah, we done had the best.

938
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:25,232
You had her your way. I had her mine.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

939
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:27,901
But we had her!

940
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,487
We had her!

941
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:34,700
Let's us drink to having some Shug.

942
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:47,462
I'll get my mail. I'm expecting
an agreement from Memphis.

943
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:49,464
You ought to wait for Mister.

944
01:38:49,632 --> 01:38:52,676
If I was to wait for Albert,
I'd wait till Christmas.

945
01:39:05,815 --> 01:39:08,025
I's married now!

946
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:13,864
I said I's married now.

947
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:51,568
Well, let's toast it at somebody.

948
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:55,113
All the evil, and all the love.

949
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:03,413
I like you, boy!

950
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,208
I like you too!

951
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:13,173
Come upstairs with me.

952
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:15,592
I got to finish stuffing the turkey.

953
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:22,057
You're my kind of man!

954
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:51,396
"April 1 8..."

955
01:41:52,607 --> 01:41:54,274
...1 935.

956
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:58,361
Dear Celie:

957
01:41:59,405 --> 01:42:01,865
I know you think I'm dead...

958
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:03,867
...but I am not.

959
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:08,038
I've been writing to you over the years...

960
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:11,541
...but Albert said
you'd never hear from me again...

961
01:42:11,709 --> 01:42:14,795
...and since I never heard from you
all this time...

962
01:42:15,213 --> 01:42:17,047
...I guess he was right.

963
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:22,219
Now I only write at Christmas and Easter...

964
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:27,641
...hoping my letters get lost among
the Christmas and Easter greetings...

965
01:42:27,809 --> 01:42:31,853
"...or that Albert get the holiday spirit
and have pity on us."

966
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:35,899
"There is so much to tell you..."

967
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:39,236
...I hardly know where to begin.

968
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:44,115
And anyway,
you probably won't get this letter either.

969
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:47,577
I am sure Albert is still the only one...

970
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:49,996
...to take the mail out of the box.

971
01:42:50,873 --> 01:42:54,084
But if this does not get to him...

972
01:42:54,669 --> 01:42:57,295
...one thing I want you to know"....

973
01:43:00,132 --> 01:43:01,967
"I Iove you..."

974
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:05,887
...and I'm not dead.

975
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:14,646
I love you and I'm not dead.

976
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:19,943
"The lady you met in town is named Corrine."

977
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:22,237
Her husband's named Samuel.

978
01:43:24,323 --> 01:43:28,743
Sanctified, religious and very good to me.

979
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:32,455
Their only sorrow in the beginning was...

980
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:35,417
...that they could not have children.

981
01:43:35,585 --> 01:43:37,919
And then they say"....

982
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:44,384
"Then they say..."

983
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:50,515
...God sent them Olivia...

984
01:43:51,434 --> 01:43:53,393
...and Adam.

985
01:43:58,566 --> 01:44:02,319
Yes, their children sent by God
are your children.

986
01:44:04,822 --> 01:44:09,075
And they have been brought up in love.

987
01:44:09,535 --> 01:44:12,913
And now God has sent me to watch over them...

988
01:44:13,497 --> 01:44:16,166
...to protect and cherish them...

989
01:44:16,334 --> 01:44:20,003
...to lavish all the love
I feel for you on them.

990
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:22,923
It's a miracle, isn't it?

991
01:44:23,215 --> 01:44:26,509
And no doubt impossible for you to believe.

992
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:29,763
Olivia and Adam are with me...

993
01:44:30,306 --> 01:44:32,641
...all growing up together...

994
01:44:33,225 --> 01:44:35,060
...a family.

995
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:38,772
"Your loving sister, Nettie."

996
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:53,161
I got two children...

997
01:44:54,664 --> 01:44:56,498
...and they's alive.

998
01:44:57,833 --> 01:44:59,709
Hear that, Miss Shug?

999
01:45:01,629 --> 01:45:05,548
Olivia and Adam.

1000
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:12,138
And they's alive.

1001
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:25,151
I love her as much as you, probably more.

1002
01:46:21,751 --> 01:46:23,793
I's getting real tired of this cat.

1003
01:46:30,134 --> 01:46:31,718
He coming back soon.

1004
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:34,012
You crazy? He in the jook joint.

1005
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:17,305
This doesn't look nothing Iike me.

1006
01:47:17,473 --> 01:47:19,015
Damn him.

1007
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:10,024
"Celie."

1008
01:48:25,624 --> 01:48:27,333
There's so many of them.

1009
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:29,169
What us gonna do?

1010
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:33,214
Go to my room and put them in order
by the postmark.

1011
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:41,181
"Dear Celie, the reason why
I am in Africa is because..."

1012
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:46,394
...one of the missionaries that was
supposed to go with Corrine and Samuel...

1013
01:48:46,562 --> 01:48:50,732
...to help with the children
and setting up the school...

1014
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:54,611
"...suddenly married a man,
and I came in her place."

1015
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:58,281
I wrote a letter to you
almost every day on the ship.

1016
01:48:58,449 --> 01:49:01,284
On my first sight of the Africa coast...

1017
01:49:01,452 --> 01:49:05,872
...something struck in me, in my soul,
Celie, like a large bell.

1018
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:07,665
I just vibrated.

1019
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:27,393
It has been a long time
since I had time to write, but always...

1020
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:32,398
...no matter what I'm doing,
I'm writing you. Dear--

1021
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:34,859
Celie! Bring me a cool drink.

1022
01:49:45,746 --> 01:49:49,332
Olinka is four days march
through the bush from the harbor.

1023
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,251
Do you know what a jungle is?

1024
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:56,047
Trees and trees and then more trees
on top of that.

1025
01:49:56,215 --> 01:49:57,298
And big!

1026
01:49:57,466 --> 01:50:00,468
They are so big, they look like they were built.

1027
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:04,597
And vines and ferns and animals and noises...

1028
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:09,018
...that make you wonder
what is lurking behind the shadows...

1029
01:50:09,186 --> 01:50:11,312
...of every bush.

1030
01:50:17,152 --> 01:50:23,366
We're up at 5:00 for a breakfast of
millet, porridge, fruit, then morning classes.

1031
01:50:23,742 --> 01:50:27,120
We teach the children English,
reading, writing...

1032
01:50:27,288 --> 01:50:31,374
...history, geography, arithmetic,
and the stories of the Bible.

1033
01:50:36,714 --> 01:50:39,716
The older children are used
to coming to the mission school.

1034
01:50:39,883 --> 01:50:41,551
The smaller ones are not.

1035
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:45,888
Their mothers sometimes drag them here
screaming and kicking.

1036
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:49,892
They're all boys. Olivia's the only girl.

1037
01:51:01,864 --> 01:51:04,699
There is a little African girl called Tashi.

1038
01:51:04,867 --> 01:51:07,160
She plays with Olivia after school.

1039
01:51:07,328 --> 01:51:10,496
"Why can't Tashi come to school?"
she asks me.

1040
01:51:10,664 --> 01:51:14,042
I told her the Olinka don't believe
in educating girls.

1041
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:16,085
She said, quick as a flash:

1042
01:51:16,253 --> 01:51:20,381
"Like white people at home
who don't want black people to learn."

1043
01:51:20,841 --> 01:51:22,967
She is sharp, Celie.

1044
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:26,929
When Tashi can get away
from her chores her mother assigns her...

1045
01:51:27,097 --> 01:51:29,515
...she and Olivia hide in my hut.

1046
01:51:29,683 --> 01:51:33,269
To Olivia right now, Tashi alone is Africa.

1047
01:51:33,437 --> 01:51:38,399
Everything she learns,
she shares with Tashi. Sound familiar?

1048
01:51:53,582 --> 01:51:58,461
At first, there was the faintest
sound of movement in the forest.

1049
01:51:58,796 --> 01:52:03,549
A kind of low humming. Then there was
chopping and the sound of dragging.

1050
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:07,011
Then the scent.
Some days there's smoke.

1051
01:52:07,179 --> 01:52:10,848
Now, after two months during which
I or the children...

1052
01:52:11,016 --> 01:52:12,558
...or Corrine has been sick...

1053
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:15,812
...all we hear is chopping
and scraping and dragging.

1054
01:52:16,146 --> 01:52:18,981
And every day we smell smoke.

1055
01:52:19,149 --> 01:52:23,236
Today a boy in my afternoon class
burst out as he entered:

1056
01:52:23,404 --> 01:52:25,738
"The road approaches!"

1057
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:29,784
♪ <i>If you live right</i> ♪
♪ <i>Heaven belongs to you</i> ♪

1058
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:33,162
♪ <i>If you live right</i> ♪
♪ <i>Heaven belongs to you</i> ♪

1059
01:52:34,123 --> 01:52:38,292
Dear Celie, the white man is building a road.

1060
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:41,796
It finally reached the cassava fields
nine months ago.

1061
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:47,009
The morning after the road was done,
as far as Olinka was concerned...

1062
01:52:47,177 --> 01:52:50,680
...what should we discover,
but that the road builders were back.

1063
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:56,060
They have instructions to continue
the road for another 30 miles...

1064
01:52:56,270 --> 01:53:01,107
...and continue it on its present course
right through the village of Olinka.

1065
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:19,208
The road builders didn't deviate
an inch from the head man's plan.

1066
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:23,546
Every hut that lay in the road's path
was leveled.

1067
01:53:23,714 --> 01:53:27,884
Celie, our church, our school...

1068
01:53:28,051 --> 01:53:29,385
...my hut...

1069
01:53:29,553 --> 01:53:31,637
...all went down in a matter of hours.

1070
01:53:42,733 --> 01:53:45,401
But the worst is yet to be told.

1071
01:53:46,028 --> 01:53:51,032
Sweet Corrine died from fever and grief.

1072
01:53:51,867 --> 01:53:54,911
We buried her in the Olinka way.

1073
01:53:57,915 --> 01:54:00,416
But, Celie, my dear, sweet sister...

1074
01:54:00,626 --> 01:54:05,838
...we'll all be coming home once we work
something out with U.S. lmmigration.

1075
01:54:06,006 --> 01:54:09,800
They don't know if we're American,
African, or missionary.

1076
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:12,011
Just pray for us, Celie.

1077
01:54:12,679 --> 01:54:14,847
Watch for me in the sunset.

1078
01:54:20,229 --> 01:54:23,397
What's with you?
I was calling you for an hour!

1079
01:54:23,732 --> 01:54:26,275
Now get my shave and don't keep me waiting!

1080
01:54:26,443 --> 01:54:30,780
Left, right! Left, right! Left, right!

1081
01:54:30,948 --> 01:54:34,659
- Where's Celie?
- Home fixing to shave Mister.

1082
01:55:01,228 --> 01:55:06,315
You got a fever? I didn't come here
for you to take all day to shave me.

1083
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:09,944
Get the molasses out of your ass!

1084
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:48,733
The longer I'm married to you,
the slower and dumber you get.

1085
01:55:49,610 --> 01:55:53,070
Your ass is as slow as I ever seen it before.

1086
01:56:21,224 --> 01:56:24,268
Celie! Ain't that razor sharpened yet?

1087
01:56:24,645 --> 01:56:28,022
Get on out here and do me right now!
Get on out here!

1088
01:56:33,528 --> 01:56:34,945
All right.

1089
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:56,509
No!

1090
01:57:17,656 --> 01:57:18,948
Put your head back.

1091
01:57:34,548 --> 01:57:37,091
Cut my neck and I'll get you by the ears.

1092
01:57:51,148 --> 01:57:54,108
That razor looks dull to me, Miss Celie.

1093
01:58:03,785 --> 01:58:05,411
Damn women.

1094
01:58:27,934 --> 01:58:30,311
How you feeling, Miss Sofia?

1095
01:58:30,979 --> 01:58:32,646
Confused.

1096
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:35,357
Ain't you glad to be home?

1097
01:58:36,818 --> 01:58:38,110
Maybe.

1098
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:47,203
Grandpa, I'm full.
I'm not hungry anymore.

1099
01:58:48,288 --> 01:58:52,416
- Now come the time for me to tell you.
- What?

1100
01:58:53,543 --> 01:58:55,503
It's time for us to go.

1101
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:59,715
You're such good people.
Salt of the earth.

1102
01:58:59,883 --> 01:59:01,550
It's time to move on.

1103
01:59:01,718 --> 01:59:04,804
- Celie is coming with us.
- Say what?

1104
01:59:05,889 --> 01:59:08,557
Celie is coming to Memphis with us.

1105
01:59:08,725 --> 01:59:10,810
Over my dead body!

1106
01:59:10,977 --> 01:59:13,646
You satisfied? That's what you want?

1107
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:16,440
Now what's wrong with you?

1108
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:20,444
You a lowdown, dirty dog, that's what's wrong.

1109
01:59:22,322 --> 01:59:26,367
It's time for me to get away from you
and enter Creation.

1110
01:59:26,535 --> 01:59:29,078
Your dead body be just the welcome mat I need.

1111
01:59:29,246 --> 01:59:32,039
You can't talk to my boy that way.

1112
01:59:32,249 --> 01:59:33,791
Your boy.

1113
01:59:34,251 --> 01:59:38,629
If he hadn't been your boy,
he might have been a halfway decent man.

1114
01:59:38,797 --> 01:59:39,839
Say what?

1115
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:42,466
You took my sister Nettie away from me.

1116
01:59:44,970 --> 01:59:48,973
You knew she was the only somebody
in the world who loved me.

1117
01:59:53,854 --> 01:59:56,772
But Nettie and my kids are coming home soon.

1118
01:59:56,940 --> 02:00:00,901
And when we all get together,
we're going to whup your ass.

1119
02:00:03,822 --> 02:00:07,491
Nettie and your kids?
Woman, you talking crazy.

1120
02:00:07,784 --> 02:00:12,204
I got children.
My children are Iiving in Africa.

1121
02:00:13,623 --> 02:00:14,957
Africa!

1122
02:00:15,792 --> 02:00:17,376
Learning different languages.

1123
02:00:18,044 --> 02:00:20,671
Fresh air, plenty of exercise.

1124
02:00:21,256 --> 02:00:25,759
They'll turn out better than these fools
you never tried to raise.

1125
02:00:25,969 --> 02:00:28,304
- Hold on, here!
- No "hold on," Harpo.

1126
02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:33,642
If you hadn't tried to rule over Sofia,
white folks wouldn't have got her.

1127
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:36,645
- That's a lie!
- A Iittle truth in it.

1128
02:00:38,398 --> 02:00:43,819
Y'all was rotten kids.
You was. You was rotten kids!

1129
02:00:46,197 --> 02:00:48,657
Made my life here hell.

1130
02:00:49,701 --> 02:00:53,245
Your daddy ain't nothing
but some dead horseshit.

1131
02:00:58,668 --> 02:01:01,795
Shut up! It's bad luck for a woman
to laugh at a man!

1132
02:01:21,650 --> 02:01:25,027
My God, the dead has arisen.

1133
02:01:27,781 --> 02:01:33,160
I had enough bad luck
to keep me laughing the rest of my life.

1134
02:01:34,788 --> 02:01:40,250
Sat in that jail
till I near about done rot to death.

1135
02:01:41,711 --> 02:01:44,213
I know what it like, Miss Celie.

1136
02:01:44,798 --> 02:01:47,216
Want to go somewhere and can't.

1137
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:53,347
I know what it like to want to sing
and have it beat out of you.

1138
02:01:55,016 --> 02:01:57,851
I want to thank you, Miss Celie...

1139
02:01:58,144 --> 02:02:00,854
...for everything you done for me.

1140
02:02:02,148 --> 02:02:05,734
I remember the day I was in the store
with Miss Millie.

1141
02:02:07,153 --> 02:02:11,365
I was feeling real down.
I was feeling mighty bad.

1142
02:02:12,659 --> 02:02:14,576
And when I see'd you...

1143
02:02:16,246 --> 02:02:18,497
...I knowed there is a God.

1144
02:02:19,666 --> 02:02:25,170
I knowed there is a God, and one day
I was going to get to come home.

1145
02:02:26,131 --> 02:02:28,966
You won't get a penny of my money.
Not one thin dime!

1146
02:02:29,134 --> 02:02:32,344
Did I ever ask you for anything?
Did I ever ask you for anything?

1147
02:02:32,512 --> 02:02:36,098
I never asked you for nothing! Not even
for your sorry-ass hand in marriage!

1148
02:02:36,266 --> 02:02:38,434
Nothing. I never asked you for nothing!

1149
02:02:40,645 --> 02:02:44,064
Old Sofia home now. Sofia home.

1150
02:02:44,232 --> 02:02:46,442
Things are going to change around here.

1151
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:48,444
I'm going with Shug.

1152
02:02:49,237 --> 02:02:52,781
- You going where?
- With Miss Celie and Shug.

1153
02:02:53,158 --> 02:02:55,367
I'm fixing to sing.

1154
02:02:56,119 --> 02:02:59,413
Too much racket going on in this house.
Pass me them peas.

1155
02:02:59,581 --> 02:03:03,167
- Listen, Squeak--
- My name ain't Squeak.

1156
02:03:05,045 --> 02:03:07,212
- What?
- My name is Mary Agnes.

1157
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:09,923
- Mary what?
- Mary Agnes.

1158
02:03:10,467 --> 02:03:11,759
I thought it was Squeak.

1159
02:03:11,926 --> 02:03:16,638
Who gives a damn? Boy, you going
to let this nappy-haired gal sit here...

1160
02:03:16,806 --> 02:03:20,225
...and cuss you out?
You're at the head of your own table...

1161
02:03:20,393 --> 02:03:22,186
...and you acting like a waiter!

1162
02:03:22,353 --> 02:03:24,813
Hush, you old fool!
Always meddling in somebody's business.

1163
02:03:24,981 --> 02:03:26,690
Sofia home now. Just hush up!

1164
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:34,114
She'll be back. Shug got talent.
She can sing.

1165
02:03:34,282 --> 02:03:39,495
She got spunk and can talk to anybody.
She can stand up and be noticed.

1166
02:03:39,662 --> 02:03:41,246
What you got?

1167
02:03:41,706 --> 02:03:44,333
You're ugly. You're skinny.
You're shaped funny.

1168
02:03:44,501 --> 02:03:47,252
You're too scared to open your mouth to people.

1169
02:03:47,587 --> 02:03:51,673
- All you fit to do is be Shug's maid.
- Albert, no.

1170
02:03:51,841 --> 02:03:57,096
Take out her slop jar, maybe cook her food.
You ain't even that good a cook.

1171
02:03:57,263 --> 02:04:00,766
She's a lot better than that
first wife you married.

1172
02:04:00,934 --> 02:04:04,019
This house ain't been cleaned good
since my first wife died.

1173
02:04:04,187 --> 02:04:06,605
Nobody's crazy enough to marry you.

1174
02:04:06,773 --> 02:04:09,775
So what you gonna do?
Hire yourself to farm?

1175
02:04:09,943 --> 02:04:14,071
Maybe somebody will let you
work on their railroad.

1176
02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:16,949
Maybe sweep out the caboose.

1177
02:04:20,912 --> 02:04:22,746
Any more letters come?

1178
02:04:23,706 --> 02:04:28,585
Could be. Could be not. Who's to say?

1179
02:04:29,712 --> 02:04:31,171
Celie, no!

1180
02:04:31,339 --> 02:04:34,633
I curse you! Until you do right by me...

1181
02:04:34,801 --> 02:04:37,845
...everything you think about
will crumble!

1182
02:04:38,012 --> 02:04:43,350
Don't do it. Don't trade places
with what I been through.

1183
02:04:46,896 --> 02:04:49,606
Come on, Miss Celie. Let's go to the car.

1184
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:54,236
He ain't worth it.

1185
02:04:56,156 --> 02:05:00,993
Who you think you is?
You can't curse nobody. Look at you!

1186
02:05:01,161 --> 02:05:06,248
You're black, you're poor, you're ugly,
you're a woman! You're nothing!

1187
02:05:06,416 --> 02:05:11,712
Until you do right by me,
everything you even think about gonna fail!

1188
02:05:14,883 --> 02:05:18,051
It's been a pleasure meeting all of you.
Goodbye.

1189
02:05:18,595 --> 02:05:20,762
Glad I came back just in time.

1190
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:23,932
We need some stability around here,
that's for sure.

1191
02:05:24,684 --> 02:05:28,312
I should have locked you up!
Just let you out to work!

1192
02:05:28,521 --> 02:05:31,940
The jail you planned for me
is the one you gonna rot in.

1193
02:05:32,108 --> 02:05:34,735
Celie, get in the car. Get in the car.

1194
02:05:42,285 --> 02:05:44,620
Everything you done to me...

1195
02:05:46,831 --> 02:05:48,832
...is already done to you.

1196
02:06:03,681 --> 02:06:06,975
I'm poor, black.

1197
02:06:07,852 --> 02:06:10,187
I may even be ugly.

1198
02:06:10,438 --> 02:06:13,482
But dear God, I'm here!

1199
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:15,150
I'm here!

1200
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:20,656
Hey, you'll be back!
Ha-ha-ha!

1201
02:06:20,823 --> 02:06:24,117
What are you going to do?
You'll be back!

1202
02:09:40,356 --> 02:09:44,526
Hey, boy.

1203
02:09:46,612 --> 02:09:49,322
Boy, what's the matter with you?

1204
02:09:50,032 --> 02:09:52,075
Hey, Pa.

1205
02:09:52,243 --> 02:09:54,578
This house is a wreck!

1206
02:09:55,455 --> 02:09:57,372
Been drinking.

1207
02:09:58,082 --> 02:09:59,666
You want some supper?

1208
02:09:59,834 --> 02:10:01,251
No, thank you.

1209
02:10:01,752 --> 02:10:07,132
I hear you been spending more time
at Harpo's and less in the fields.

1210
02:10:09,886 --> 02:10:12,846
I guess I just raised you wrong.

1211
02:10:13,014 --> 02:10:14,222
How's that, Pa?

1212
02:10:14,390 --> 02:10:15,974
How's that?

1213
02:10:16,893 --> 02:10:21,062
The fields are overgrown,
the animals ain't tended to...

1214
02:10:21,355 --> 02:10:23,315
...this house is a wreck.

1215
02:10:23,483 --> 02:10:26,985
And what you doing about it? Nothing.

1216
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:31,114
Just sitting here drinking, ruining your life.

1217
02:10:31,282 --> 02:10:33,408
My Iife's already ruined.

1218
02:10:34,118 --> 02:10:38,163
This house is dead.
There ain't no Shug, no children...

1219
02:10:38,331 --> 02:10:41,166
...no laughter and no life. Just me.

1220
02:10:41,334 --> 02:10:44,794
I ain't heard such nonsense in all my life.

1221
02:10:45,379 --> 02:10:50,133
Now listen to me.
I know just what you need.

1222
02:10:52,053 --> 02:10:54,346
We need you a woman.

1223
02:10:54,514 --> 02:10:58,517
Nice, little, young girl clean up the house,
iron your shirts--

1224
02:10:58,684 --> 02:11:00,977
- Bye, Pa.
- Clean up this house.

1225
02:11:01,687 --> 02:11:04,189
- Goodbye, Pa.
- You listen to what I say.

1226
02:11:04,357 --> 02:11:08,276
I ain't listening to you.
Goodbye, Pa! Bye!

1227
02:11:08,444 --> 02:11:12,447
Get yourself a young girl.
You heed your daddy's advice.

1228
02:11:12,907 --> 02:11:15,242
Get these chickens back in the coop...

1229
02:11:15,409 --> 02:11:18,203
...before they Iay eggs all over the place.

1230
02:11:24,585 --> 02:11:27,504
It's time to go now.
Time to go home.

1231
02:11:27,672 --> 02:11:29,589
You know I don't want to dance.

1232
02:11:29,799 --> 02:11:32,008
I move good for an old man.

1233
02:11:32,301 --> 02:11:35,804
Come on, time to go.
Time to go now. Come on!

1234
02:11:36,264 --> 02:11:40,976
I got some Tennessee tobacco,
cured with whiskey.

1235
02:11:41,769 --> 02:11:43,728
You know I don't smoke.

1236
02:11:44,981 --> 02:11:46,565
Time to go!

1237
02:11:46,732 --> 02:11:48,942
That's right. Time to go now.

1238
02:11:49,110 --> 02:11:51,152
Time to go.

1239
02:12:13,718 --> 02:12:16,678
Time to go. Time to go.

1240
02:12:23,811 --> 02:12:25,770
Time to go.

1241
02:12:28,524 --> 02:12:30,233
Whoo!

1242
02:12:31,402 --> 02:12:33,403
It sure is nice...

1243
02:12:37,533 --> 02:12:40,952
...to see you two together again.

1244
02:12:57,261 --> 02:12:59,638
Maybe you ought to see him home.

1245
02:12:59,805 --> 02:13:01,973
He gonna be just fine.

1246
02:13:04,685 --> 02:13:06,311
Just fine.

1247
02:13:37,968 --> 02:13:41,513
Dear God, after all these years...

1248
02:13:41,681 --> 02:13:44,766
...the man I knew as my pa is dead.

1249
02:13:49,021 --> 02:13:52,857
But then, Nettie write
that my real daddy lynched.

1250
02:13:53,067 --> 02:13:58,029
My mama marry this dead man
two years after my real daddy dead.

1251
02:13:58,197 --> 02:14:01,783
My children, not my sister and brother.

1252
02:14:01,951 --> 02:14:04,327
Pa, not Pa.

1253
02:14:05,955 --> 02:14:07,997
You his wife?

1254
02:14:08,916 --> 02:14:10,583
Yes, ma'am.

1255
02:14:12,378 --> 02:14:14,045
How'd he die?

1256
02:14:19,635 --> 02:14:21,511
On top of me.

1257
02:14:39,697 --> 02:14:42,782
Well, it's all yours now.

1258
02:14:45,327 --> 02:14:48,329
Yeah, but I still don't understand how.

1259
02:14:48,497 --> 02:14:53,334
Your real daddy owned this land
and the house and the store.

1260
02:14:53,502 --> 02:14:55,670
He left it to your mama.

1261
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:59,758
When your mama died, it passed on
to you and your sister, Nettie.

1262
02:15:00,509 --> 02:15:03,011
He left me the money though.

1263
02:15:03,179 --> 02:15:07,682
Well, if you'll excuse us,
we got a train to catch.

1264
02:15:30,790 --> 02:15:32,540
Ya-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha!

1265
02:15:44,887 --> 02:15:49,974
I ain't never figured I'd wear pants.
Not to mention the things Miss Celie made.

1266
02:15:50,226 --> 02:15:51,601
What you think?

1267
02:15:51,769 --> 02:15:54,395
Sofia, Sofia. That sure is a pretty name.

1268
02:15:56,190 --> 02:16:00,735
Now let me see you. How can a pair
of pants that fits Sofia fit me?

1269
02:16:00,903 --> 02:16:04,155
Well, Harpo,
you just going to have to try them on.

1270
02:16:04,323 --> 02:16:06,199
It's just like my sign say:

1271
02:16:06,367 --> 02:16:09,035
"One size fit all."

1272
02:16:09,286 --> 02:16:11,663
Go in there, try them on and you'll see.

1273
02:16:11,831 --> 02:16:13,998
- Sure enough?
- Sure enough. Go on, now.

1274
02:16:14,166 --> 02:16:16,167
Make sure you close that curtain.

1275
02:16:16,335 --> 02:16:19,587
I don't want you showing Emma all your business.

1276
02:16:20,256 --> 02:16:22,257
He ain't changed a lick.

1277
02:16:22,424 --> 02:16:26,302
I got this fabric from Washington.
I wanted to make you a pair of pants.

1278
02:16:26,470 --> 02:16:28,054
I don't know about no....

1279
02:16:35,312 --> 02:16:37,480
Harpo says I spend too much money.

1280
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:40,608
Miss Celie, you is a miracle!

1281
02:16:40,776 --> 02:16:43,528
Ho, ho, Harpo.
Where will you wear them britches?

1282
02:16:43,696 --> 02:16:47,323
- Nowhere.
- I know you're not! Look at you!

1283
02:16:53,914 --> 02:16:57,709
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.

1284
02:16:57,877 --> 02:17:01,129
Me and Shug, I smile.

1285
02:17:01,589 --> 02:17:03,089
But us still longing.

1286
02:17:03,257 --> 02:17:05,633
More than anything, God love admiration.

1287
02:17:05,801 --> 02:17:07,260
You saying God is vain?

1288
02:17:07,928 --> 02:17:12,223
No, not vain.
Just wanting to share a good thing.

1289
02:17:13,350 --> 02:17:17,645
I think it pisses God off
if you walk by the color purple...

1290
02:17:17,813 --> 02:17:19,355
...in a field...

1291
02:17:19,690 --> 02:17:21,482
...and you don't notice it.

1292
02:17:23,110 --> 02:17:27,739
Are you saying it just want
to be loved like it say in the Bible?

1293
02:17:28,115 --> 02:17:32,201
Yeah, Celie.
Everything want to be loved.

1294
02:17:33,037 --> 02:17:36,706
Us sing and dance and holler...

1295
02:17:37,458 --> 02:17:39,876
...just trying to be loved.

1296
02:17:41,629 --> 02:17:43,338
Look at them trees.

1297
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:48,092
Ever notice how trees do everything
to get attention that we do...

1298
02:17:48,636 --> 02:17:50,386
...except walk?

1299
02:17:53,974 --> 02:17:58,519
