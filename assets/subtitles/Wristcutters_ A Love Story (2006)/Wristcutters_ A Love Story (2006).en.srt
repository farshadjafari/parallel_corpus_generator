1
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,755
I think she cried at my funeral.

2
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,593
I don't mean to brag about it or anything,

3
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,294
but I'm pretty sure she did.

4
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:33,305
Sometimes I can picture her talking about me

5
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,500
to some guy she feels really close to.

6
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,373
You're never going
to see him again, you know?

7
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,036
How they lowered me
into the grave

8
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,375
all pathetic and shriveled up,

9
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,314
like a melted chocolate bar
or something.

10
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,411
About how we never
actually got a chance.

11
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,049
Then the guy fucks her real nice...

12
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,288
a fuck that's all about
making her feel better.

13
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,218
Soon after I killed myself,

14
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,780
I found a job here at Kamikaze Pizza.

15
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,487
It's not a great job, but it'll do for a while.

16
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,096
The manager was cool enough

17
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,499
to hook me up with a place to live, too,

18
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,505
with this Austrian guy named Erik.

19
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,404
You did it again, Zia.

20
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,874
Did what?

21
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,036
Don't play dumb. You promised.

22
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,103
If you're going to live in this apartment,

23
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,274
you have to sit while you piss.

24
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,284
That. I'm sorry. I forgot.

25
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,947
How in the world you forget
something like that?

26
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,680
Sit, sit, sit.

27
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,533
Who could think
of a better punishment, really?

28
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:16,166
Everything's the same here.
It's just a little worse.

29
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,608
I've thought about suicide again,

30
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,813
but I haven't tried it.

31
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:34,520
I didn't want to end up
in a bigger shit hole than this one.

32
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:40,760
Yeah, I was missing Desiree.

33
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,200
I even had a feeling
that this whole suicide thing

34
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,864
just made me miss her
and love her more.

35
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,339
But... who knows?

36
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,877
Maybe you just need a drink.

37
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,430
Hi.

38
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,557
Listen, my friend Rachel and I,
we play this game

39
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,727
where we try to figure out
how people off themselves.

40
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,829
We were just guessing about you.

41
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,067
How'd you do it?

42
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,838
Three points for me!

43
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,444
That's an extremely rude question to ask.

44
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,181
Precisely.

45
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,849
That's what the game's all about.

46
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,586
I see. What about you?

47
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,423
Me?

48
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,042
No, no, no, no, no.
Look at him.

49
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,943
He can't stop burping.
It's definitely drowning.

50
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,309
No, I'm telling you,
look at the bluish face.

51
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,750
It's got to be gas.

52
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,014
Go over and ask him.

53
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,924
No. I don't know about this one.

54
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,895
- He seems ill-humored.
- No, no, you got to...

55
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,625
Why don't you try it with me?

56
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,634
Do you know this guy?

57
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,701
I'll bet you girls a beer you won't guess.

58
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,246
Tania, look who's here.

59
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,580
We'll be right back.

60
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,948
Right back.

61
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,247
I will tell you something.

62
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,687
Whenever a chick says
"I'll be right back,"

63
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,622
write them off, man.

64
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,923
They always end up leaving
with some retarded big-Joe guy.

65
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,063
So what was it?

66
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,001
What was what?

67
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,768
How did you, uh,
you know, off yourself?

68
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,969
Oh, that.

69
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,571
Let me go, lovely

70
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,775
Let me go

71
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,418
You guys suck!

72
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,750
Suck big time!

73
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,585
Get off the stage!

74
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,091
Fuck it all!

75
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,923
Jesus! Go home, man!

76
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,462
Boo!

77
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,092
You offed with the guitar?

78
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,602
Sure, I did.

79
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,104
On stage, man.

80
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,639
It was wild.

81
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,437
Iggy Pop almost came to see that gig.

82
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,871
No way.

83
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,538
It's true.

84
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,846
I live with my parents
and my kid brother Kostya.

85
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,477
You're fucking with me.

86
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,045
I'm not fucking with you.

87
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,320
I've never heard of
a whole family here before.

88
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,054
Mom...

89
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,461
offed because she was
missing Russia a lot.

90
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,433
And my father, he just didn't feel
like going on without her.

91
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:48,675
But what really did it for him
was my little brother turning out to be gay.

92
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,682
And your kid brother?

93
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,911
- Kostya?
- Kostya.

94
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,614
I guess he had it in his genes, man.

95
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,583
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard, man.

96
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,460
When, uh, Kostya came here,

97
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:09,194
my father...
a man who wouldn't cry...

98
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,964
if you dropped 10-pound
sledgehammer on his foot.

99
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,973
Hugged kid, though,
and cried like baby. No shit.

100
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,531
Wow.

101
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,205
We have to kill those germs.

102
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,770
- For borscht...
- We have a saying in Russia.

103
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,907
How much you eat,
that's how old you are.

104
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,578
My grandpa, before
he'd hire anybody,

105
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,314
he'd feed them a free meal.

106
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,379
- Those who ate the most...
- Whoa.

107
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,391
...that's the ones
he hired, 'cause...

108
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,222
Those were the best workers.

109
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,229
Are you trying
to hire me or something?

110
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,162
How about
doing the dishes after dinner?

111
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,393
Kostya, no.

112
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,528
You know, Zia, dishwashing was Eugene's
first job in America.

113
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,696
No way.

114
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,364
I did a lot of shit.

115
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,535
Last job I had before I offed
was waiting tables.

116
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,135
I thought it was the band thing.

117
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,272
I had to eat, too.

118
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,146
You know, I wish
we were there for Eugene.

119
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,813
You see, Zia, all of us,
we were always together.

120
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,824
First in Russia,
then in America, now here.

121
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,555
When lvan and I came here and left our boys
alone, they just couldn't make...

122
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,221
Mom, that's all over now.

123
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,629
Yeah.

124
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,690
Where are you from, Zia?

125
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,030
Uh, New Jersey.

126
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,401
Oh. What about your parents?

127
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,337
Uh, it's... it's a long story.

128
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,671
It's not... Basically, at the end,

129
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,677
- I hadn't talk to them in a while.
- Zia, it's okay.

130
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,474
They hadn't talked to each other.

131
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,478
It is, yeah.

132
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,310
<i>Nyet.</i>

133
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,543
Not every family is lucky like we are.

134
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:33,880
That's true.

135
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,784
But all of us being together...

136
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,464
You know,

137
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,626
I'd be here a long time ago
if it weren't for Eugene.

138
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,533
Yeah? How come?

139
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,901
I was 10.

140
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,462
We had these soccer finals.

141
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,065
I was the goalie for my school.

142
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,338
Eugene!

143
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,448
Don't you hear I'm jamming?

144
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,747
How is it possible
for the better team to lose?

145
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,879
We didn't deserve to!

146
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,348
The ball just wouldn't get in!

147
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,327
And they won it in the finals!

148
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,489
So what's the point of living

149
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,534
when life is so unfair
and everything?

150
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,502
I'm just telling you this because you're
the smartest person I know.

151
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,335
If you don't give me one
good reason to keep living

152
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,967
and tell me what's the meaning of life,

153
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,773
I'm gonna do this.

154
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,447
Step down from the table.

155
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,848
No. First tell me.

156
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,684
Step down from the table,
and I'll tell you.

157
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,811
He just smacked you?

158
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,144
Yeah.

159
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,242
I don't exactly know what he was trying
to tell me when he did it,

160
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,050
but it worked fine
up until a couple months ago.

161
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,561
You know, when I see
you guys like this,

162
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,256
it kind of makes me
miss my parents,

163
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,233
even though most of the time
they just kind of freaked me out.

164
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,571
You know...

165
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,881
why didn't we move in together earlier?

166
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,577
'Cause we didn't know
it'd be this fun.

167
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:47,812
Yeah.

168
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,392
Oh, God, I love those things.

169
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,626
These what? These?

170
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,001
Who? Ophelia?

171
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,872
Desiree.

172
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,744
Whatever. An ex-girlfriend from an ex-life.

173
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,977
Listen, tonight when we go out,
man, you got to promise...

174
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,987
No, no, no. Eugene, I'm not going out
tonight or any other night.

175
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,683
- What?
- It just makes me depressed.

176
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,158
So what are you going to do?
Kill yourself?

177
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,491
I don't know. Maybe.

178
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,355
As if anything would make you happy.

179
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,799
I love you.

180
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,168
- I love you.
- You do?

181
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,677
Did you finish my cottage cheese?

182
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,406
Zia, did you finish my cottage cheese?

183
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,281
Calm down, Erik. I'll buy you
some more cottage cheese.

184
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,945
No. That's not the point.

185
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,616
I was planning on having some right now.

186
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,422
Don't you have a plan B
or something?

187
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,462
Zia, you do it all the time!

188
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,897
All right! All right!

189
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,231
I'll go get some more
cottage cheese.

190
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,208
Zia?

191
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,405
I was hoping we'd run into
each other sooner or later.

192
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,574
Brian, what are you doing here?

193
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,619
Same as everyone else.
Same as everyone else.

194
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,779
Only it's got a little something to do with you.

195
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,288
Oh, yeah?

196
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,451
Did you come all the way here
to get the 200 bucks I owe you?

197
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,460
Ha ha. You were always a million laughs.

198
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,893
But, no, that's not it.

199
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,830
You know how people say that
suicides happen in threes?

200
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,230
Well, there's something to that.

201
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,827
Hey, is this cheese any good?

202
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,202
Uh, my roommate likes it.

203
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,207
You know, when people start
offing themselves around you,

204
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,835
you start asking yourself,
what makes me so different?

205
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,277
You know?
What's keeping me alive?

206
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,372
Then it hit me like a mallet.

207
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,179
I don't have the answers.
Too much sodium.

208
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,813
But I think it was Desiree's suicide
that really hit me.

209
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,187
- D-Desiree's what?
- Yeah, Desiree's.

210
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,783
She offed herself about a month after you.
I figured you'd know that.

211
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,658
- No.
- Hey!

212
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,857
What about the 200 you owe me?
I still want that.

213
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,800
So I'm saying I got a pretty good idea

214
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,035
she's not in the city.

215
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,600
Call it, you know, intuition or whatever.

216
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,772
Listen, man, worst-case scenario,
we just take a ride, right?

217
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,645
Who, we?

218
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,742
All right.

219
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,753
Let me put it this way.

220
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,415
Since you got here,
how many times did you get laid, man?

221
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,620
- Why?
- Just a question.

222
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,358
Actually laid?

223
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,092
Yes.

224
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,134
- None, I think.
- You think?

225
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,601
None. But what's that got
to do with any of this?

226
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,104
Plenty. 'Cause your sperm count is so high,

227
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,038
you think you're having
an out-of-body experience

228
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,372
like nobody in the whole
fucking universe, man.

229
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,775
Eugene.

230
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,405
Sperm count too high?
That's a crock.

231
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,244
Listen, man, just let me borrow the car.

232
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,749
You don't have to do anything else.

233
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,752
Don't... Don't get so touchy
on me all of a sudden.

234
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,084
All I said is not good enough reason
for me to go.

235
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,851
Listen, you know what?
Forget Desiree.

236
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,189
I got another reason for you to go.

237
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,989
Give it a shot.

238
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,757
You got anything better to do?

239
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,111
I mean, what's the big deal?

240
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,376
It's just the headlights, right?

241
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,815
You wouldn't
believe how many times

242
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,318
I've tried to have it fixed.

243
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,648
You're telling me this now?

244
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,656
I mean, this means we can't
drive at night. At all.

245
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,316
We'll stop somewhere
before it gets dark.

246
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,327
We'll just get them fixed.
It's on me. I'll pay for it.

247
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,828
If you insist.

248
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,229
But I'll bet you a beer it can't be fixed.

249
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,065
Let's get some music, man.

250
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,265
What is this? These work, right?

251
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,274
- Oh, shit.
- What?

252
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,243
Anything that goes underneath that seat,
forget about it.

253
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,711
Is there a hole or something?

254
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,270
Yeah.

255
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,976
No. It's, uh...

256
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,143
Kind of.

257
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,619
It's more like... I guess you'd say black hole

258
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:20,385
or a... a... a Bermuda Triangle.

259
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:24,327
You know, things just
disappear on you.

260
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,903
That's not very good.

261
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,404
What is it?

262
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,464
- It's my old band.
- Really?

263
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,942
I had it in my pocket when I offed.

264
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,147
Take that for a sec.

265
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,420
Oh, man, that's worse
than I remember.

266
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,423
What are you talking about? I like it.

267
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,425
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

268
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,824
It's not bad at all.

269
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,312
Mike's Car Shop.

270
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,013
Perfect timing, huh?

271
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,022
I'll bet you a beer they can't fix it.

272
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,354
You're on, man.

273
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,166
Uh, okay.

274
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,726
Um, uh, it's broken.

275
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,328
And so I don't... I don't...

276
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,272
I'm not sure what it is that's wrong.

277
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:47,972
But Mike is my... is my boss,
and he's an absolute genius.

278
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,980
We're gonna get it fixed.
You guys just wait right here.

279
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,676
Okay? Okay?

280
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,489
Hey, see that car?

281
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,460
It's been cruising back and forth
since we got here.

282
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,019
I saw it five times already.

283
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,259
It's a taxicab, Eugene.

284
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,198
Think, man.

285
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,670
Who the fuck would need taxi here?

286
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,333
I don't... I don't know.
What are you trying to say?

287
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,342
Look at the driver.

288
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,640
- Why?
- He's Arab.

289
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,840
You've never seen
an Arab taxi driver before?

290
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,678
Oh, sure, I did.

291
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,946
But not since I offed.

292
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,954
Connect the dots.

293
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,923
Arabs, suicides.

294
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,357
Doesn't that freak you out
even a little bit?

295
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,827
No, man. You sound
like a fucking, uh,

296
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,330
Homeland Security agent.

297
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,991
I mean, you forget where we are.

298
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,159
He's dead already.

299
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,793
We're dead.
Everybody here is dead.

300
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,395
He's not gonna try anything.
Nobody gives a shit here.

301
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,906
We're all immigrants now, man.

302
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,943
Then why is he looking
at me like that?

303
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,211
'Cause you're staring at him
like you need a fucking taxicab.

304
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,772
Quit looking at him. He'll go away.

305
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,913
Oh, shoot.

306
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,182
It looks like we're staying here tonight.

307
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,555
Hey, boy, how you doin'? You're pretty.

308
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,891
Hey, Jimmy, why don't you
go start this thing up?

309
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,692
Let's hear this beauty moan.

310
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:17,098
Well... Moan?
No, no. We just want to...

311
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,934
The headlights.

312
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,468
Oh, you need a...

313
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:32,779
You need an exhaust system,
valves got to be adjusted.

314
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,115
Oh, what a bitch
of a fuel pump you got in there.

315
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,950
No, no, no, no. No, no.

316
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,887
We just want to fix the headlights.

317
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,435
Honey, are you home?

318
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,868
Honey?

319
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,576
He hasn't slept a wink
since we got here.

320
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,142
We'll fix your headlights by tomorrow.

321
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,984
- Get them fixed by tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

322
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,024
Yeah. Tomorrow.

323
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,557
Fucking shift stick.

324
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,563
This is the last time I sleep in the car.

325
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,565
Yeah.

326
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,897
Where are my shades?

327
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,734
I dr... I dropped them.

328
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,742
Man, I told you to be
careful about that, man.

329
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,675
- I know, I know.
- God damn it.

330
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,509
I was, Eugene. It's... It's so bright.

331
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,242
I didn't mean to drop them
under there.

332
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:14,877
I gotta... I gotta piss, man.

333
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,717
Aah! God damn!

334
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,950
What the hell?

335
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,016
Morning, boys.

336
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,026
Nothing like a good
night's sleep, huh?

337
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,532
These headlights
are giving me a headache.

338
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,535
But you give me a day or two,

339
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,367
I'll have it fixed up
once and for all and forever.

340
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,202
That's how Mike does it.

341
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,869
Once and all and for... forever.

342
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:43,403
Wait. Look at this,
look at this, look at this.

343
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,076
Looks like you owe me
first beer of the day.

344
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:54,549
I told you, man. No one can fix
the headlights in this car.

345
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,525
You asleep?

346
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,500
Yeah, man, I'm asleep.

347
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,232
You're missing a lot of beautiful shit.

348
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,679
Can't believe you lost my shades.

349
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,884
Holy shit.

350
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,262
Oh, geez!

351
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,131
What the... Wait. What... Oh...

352
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,695
Eugene, what?

353
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:42,933
What?

354
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,245
Afternoon, lady.

355
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,746
Where you guys going?

356
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,441
East-ish.

357
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:52,847
East-ish?

358
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,588
You guys don't have any clue
where you're going, do you?

359
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,818
Well, you haven't been here very long, right?

360
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,883
Why's that?

361
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,124
'Cause if anybody here had a clue,
we wouldn't be here in the first place.

362
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,767
True.

363
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,428
I am pretty new.

364
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:16,804
Actually, I've been hitchhiking
ever since I got here.

365
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,137
How come?

366
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,769
Because I'm looking
for the people in charge.

367
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,608
- People in charge?
- Yeah.

368
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,115
Just where do you think you are?

369
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,685
Some kind of country club

370
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,813
where you can just walk
into the main office?

371
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,051
Tell me, please,
when you were still living,

372
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,956
did you ever try to go looking for God?

373
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,890
No. But I really didn't have
any reason to back then.

374
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,762
And what reason do you have now?

375
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,859
I mean, you know,
are you just sorry you offed?

376
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,097
You, uh, changed your mind?

377
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,037
Because, you know, if that's the case,

378
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,699
and you're just waiting
for visa back home...

379
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,834
- Eugene, Eugene, Eugene.
- What? What?

380
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,173
What's your name?

381
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,837
Mikal.

382
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,575
- What's your name?
- Zia.

383
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,583
- Eugene.
- Nice to meet you.

384
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,518
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks.

385
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,282
So you're trying to leave?

386
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,789
You don't like it here?

387
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,484
Are you joking?

388
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:12,151
Do you guys like it here?

389
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,927
Who the hell likes being stuck in a place
where you can't even smile?

390
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,629
It's hot as balls. Everybody's an asshole.

391
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,636
I just want to go home.

392
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,574
- I don't know.
- I like it.

393
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,779
Yeah, better than sleeping
in the car, man.

394
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,082
All right.

395
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,487
I'll go get the cashier.

396
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:45,419
I like that it has a window right here.

397
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,397
It's nice.

398
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,232
You want to try it out?

399
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,032
What do you mean?

400
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,335
You know what I mean.

401
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,968
I think I'm gonna go
see how Zia's doing.

402
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:36,739
I wonder if people who die normally
end up with no stars.

403
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,079
I really miss the stars.

404
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,116
You get used to it.

405
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,816
I don't want to get used to it.
I want to go home.

406
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,052
This guy who gave me
a ride the other day,

407
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,756
he said that he actually heard rumors
about the people in charge.

408
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,822
Um, apparently they wear
white outfits or something.

409
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,800
That's a crock of shit... white outfits.

410
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,962
He was just trying to get into your pants.

411
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,802
No, he wasn't.

412
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,808
He said he thought I had a really good case.

413
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,037
Oh, and what makes
your case so special,

414
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,273
if you don't mind me asking?

415
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,577
That I got here by mistake.

416
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:16,813
Well, we all got here by some mistake
one way or another.

417
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,822
And believe me,
you have as much chance

418
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,951
at finding your folks in white
as Zia has to find his dead princess.

419
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,688
You don't know that.

420
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,698
No, you don't. I bet he'll find her.

421
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,327
Yeah. Besides, I got a hunch
she's not that far away.

422
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,629
Wherever she is,

423
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,504
I bet she found someone by now.

424
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:41,409
Probably some black guy
who hanged himself by his dick.

425
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,811
It wouldn't matter, Eugene.

426
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,661
You know, I was thinking.

427
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,993
Yeah?

428
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:03,227
If you were to ever cheat on me...

429
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,567
make sure you do it
with somebody who's really pretty.

430
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,575
What are you...
What are you talking about?

431
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,668
I'm not gonna cheat on you.
Why do you say that?

432
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,736
I know, baby.

433
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,979
Hey, Eugene, do you mind if I drive?

434
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,648
I'll get us there in half the time.

435
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,248
Get us where?

436
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,161
Over there.

437
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,328
Oh, there.

438
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,391
All right, then.

439
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,106
I'm not sitting in the back.

440
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,474
Why not?

441
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,207
'Cause everybody knows
guy in the back seat doesn't have a cock.

442
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,308
- What?
- That's a fact.

443
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,352
If the guy in the back seat
had a cock,

444
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,182
he wouldn't be back there
in the first place.

445
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,017
Well, l... I mean, I got a cock, man.

446
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,924
So how can... I'm not...

447
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,020
Mik, do you have a cock?

448
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,792
Yeah, I have a cock.

449
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,492
A big fat one.

450
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,287
I'm looking for the people in charge

451
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,447
because I'm here by mistake.

452
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:06,888
I'm not supposed to be here.

453
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,756
I've been looking for a while.

454
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,125
I'm looking for a girl named Desiree.

455
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,959
Short blonde hair,
about this tall.

456
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:17,263
I'm not sure what you're
trying to accomplish is completely legal.

457
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,394
- Well, that's very...
- Can I see some I. D?

458
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,301
We're looking for the people in charge
of this place

459
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,862
because I've only been
here a couple weeks

460
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,033
and I got here by mistake.

461
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,973
Did I show you...

462
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,376
Thanks, "Ociffer," but we...

463
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,913
The people in charge.

464
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,243
- <i>Nyet,</i> Mom.
- P. I.C.

465
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,750
About this tall.

466
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,752
Her name's Desiree. She's really pretty.

467
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,838
When there's a trap

468
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,706
Set up for you

469
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:04,043
In every corner of your room

470
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,210
And so

471
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,845
The only way to go

472
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,684
Is

473
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,951
Through the roof

474
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,622
Through the roof

475
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,668
Underground

476
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,137
Through the roof

477
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,474
Underground

478
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:38,948
And as we crossing border after border

479
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,509
We realize the differences now

480
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,687
It's underdogs who

481
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,692
And if you want it, too

482
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,459
You'll always have to make your own fun

483
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,661
Hey, man, you need
to wipe these off for me.

484
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:03,332
# The local cultures
are dying and dying #

485
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,673
# The product growers
are buying and buying #

486
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:09,008
Man, are you doing that
intentionally to hurt me?

487
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,945
No. No. It's... It's not my fault.

488
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,482
I just wanted you to clean those off.

489
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,415
- I know. I was cleaning.
- That's a hole. I told you.

490
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,248
You want to see if my hat
drops down the hole?

491
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,083
No, I'm not gonna
drop your hat in the hole!

492
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,646
Guys, guys, guys, guys!

493
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,658
Here's my tobacco.
See if that goes down.

494
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,251
Guys, guys, please stop bickering.

495
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,319
Please?

496
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,592
Eugene, there's a diner right there.
Will you stop?

497
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,190
Good. Perf... Perfect timing.

498
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,293
And you, don't touch my stuff no more.

499
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,032
- You handed me the shades, man.
- Don't touch my stuff no more.

500
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,176
Yes, Mama.

501
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,315
Didn't he already talk
to his mom this morning?

502
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,876
Yeah, but, supposedly,
that's, uh, normal in Russia.

503
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,716
I don't think that's normal anywhere.

504
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,225
Yeah, I know.

505
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,990
I'm gonna go get some smokes.
Do you want anything?

506
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,305
Next time you grab my ass,

507
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,309
I'm going to tell your mom, asshole, okay?

508
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,208
Okay?

509
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:45,039
All I'm saying is neither of us
have scored with her, you know?

510
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,202
I don't know about that.

511
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,907
The other night, uh, she said
she thought you were cute.

512
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,813
Cute?

513
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,375
That's what they say about a puppy.

514
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,684
The only thing worse
is "good friend" or "nice person."

515
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,224
In plain English it means
"I'll leech off you as long as I can,

516
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,193
but don't even think
about getting into my pants."

517
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,127
Yeah, well, you might be right about that.

518
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,530
Of course I'm right.
I say we get rid of her while we still can.

519
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,692
I mean, look.

520
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:13,601
Look at what we're losing out on
because of her.

521
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,268
Yeah, I don't know.

522
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,606
The whole "people in charge" thing
is a little weird.

523
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,805
See? That's what I'm talking about.

524
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,579
Shoot.

525
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,488
Look, fuck her, man.

526
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,150
Okay? That's what I'm talking about.

527
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,750
She's eavesdropping
on her friends now.

528
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,114
Where'd you get those shades?

529
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,912
What shades?

530
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,756
Mikal bought us shades, man.

531
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,262
Sweet of her.

532
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,598
But it is good to be on our own, you know?

533
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,807
Eugene, you know, I love you, man,

534
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,502
but you can be an asshole.

535
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,205
What do you care?

536
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,214
We're looking for Irene, right?

537
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,977
Yeah, we're looking for Irene.

538
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,177
All right. Then let's look for Irene.

539
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,443
Okay, just calm down.

540
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,848
If you just comply,
everything's gonna be just fine.

541
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,545
On what charges?

542
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,713
Breaking that sign is
a clear case of vandalism.

543
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:45,915
That's absolutely retarded.

544
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,046
- You're handcuffing me, too?
- Yes.

545
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,216
Are you serious?

546
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,522
Yes, I'm placing you under arrest.
Hands behind your back.

547
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,493
I was just trying to make this place

548
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,929
a little bit less depressing.

549
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,466
What's the big deal with that?
This is so dramatic.

550
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,126
You don't even need to be doing this.

551
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,102
- No. Wait, Officer.
- What the hell is your problem?

552
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,399
That's my sister. What's going on?

553
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,304
Your sister?

554
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,865
Yeah, yeah. What's going on?

555
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,934
I'm afraid your sister's been arrested.

556
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,536
Arrested?

557
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,343
Wait. Can I talk to you for a minute?

558
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,679
What have you got to say?

559
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,221
l... I mean, she's only
been here a few mo...

560
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,350
- You know, how long you been here?
- Some time.

561
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,951
First of all, she just got here.

562
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,531
Well, you remember what it's like
those first couple months, right?

563
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,128
I mean, the no-smiling thing's
really getting to her.

564
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,436
Nobody's got any good humor
or anything like that.

565
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,764
Well, I can turn
my head away this once.

566
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,673
Yeah?

567
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,804
Ma'am, you better watch your behavior.

568
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,111
You bet, Officer.

569
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,714
You didn't have to do that.

570
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,891
Thank you.

571
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,932
What are you... You gonna...

572
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,573
Can we still give you a ride?

573
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,375
No, thanks. I think I'm headed
the other way.

574
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,247
Listen, l...

575
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:56,718
I'm sorry about all that back there.

576
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,550
It's...

577
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,182
We didn't mean that.
It's just Eugene's venting.

578
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:02,816
That's okay.

579
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,327
Doesn't matter.

580
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,359
I just want to...

581
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,797
We don't...
We don't mean that.

582
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,494
You know what?
It's probably gonna be hard

583
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,969
for me to get a ride
with you standing there, so...

584
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,503
Yeah. Probably right.

585
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,604
I hope you find what you're looking for.

586
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,774
Thank you.

587
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,580
I really do.

588
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,157
- Where were you, man?
- Guess who I just saw.

589
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,167
Who?

590
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,101
Mikal. She's right back there.

591
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,234
What the fuck was that?

592
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:53,401
Oh, man. You didn't
take out the nozzle?

593
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,004
You deal with this guy. I'm not into it.

594
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,173
What?

595
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,707
I'm sorry again.

596
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:04,276
Oh, it happens all the time.

597
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,755
At least twice a week.

598
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,657
- Really?
- It happens. See?

599
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,992
All these are already filled out.

600
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,122
Right here.

601
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,100
What's this here about, uh,

602
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:29,373
"What were you thinking
when the incident occurred?"

603
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,243
Exactly that.

604
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,704
Here I am again, buried in debt.

605
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,002
If pulling the trigger
didn't solve my problems,

606
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,008
what the hell will?

607
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:05,009
I was wondering if I
was too drunk to drive.

608
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,325
But the problem with you
is that you don't think it's fucked up

609
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,368
- to talk shit about me when I'm not there.
- I was kidding.

610
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,336
You were kidding?
You didn't know I was listening.

611
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,736
No, I didn't.
That's eavesdropping.

612
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,570
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Whatever.

613
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,507
- Look, I found...
- Calm down, man.

614
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,010
- Look at this.
- Calm down. Relax.

615
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,512
It's her phone number. It's Desiree.

616
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,844
It's her phone number, her address,
everything. Look at that.

617
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:43,182
I spaced out because the man at pump 3
looked just like my ex-boyfriend.

618
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:45,187
Where is he?

619
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,086
He feels so close.

620
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:50,820
I knew she was close, man.
I told you, man. I felt it.

621
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:53,920
All right. What do you want to do?
You want to call her?

622
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,124
No, let's go over there.

623
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,759
That guy said it's
not very far from here.

624
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,565
Let's go, man. Let's go!
I told you, man.

625
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,232
You should buy her
some flowers at least.

626
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,068
Flowers would be nice, but l... l...

627
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,203
did you see the flowers in there?

628
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,509
Yeah.

629
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,552
That's not too bad, huh?

630
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,463
- Yeah. Desiree has some taste.
- No shit.

631
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:33,025
What other color could someone
named Desiree like but turquoise?

632
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,783
Oh, holy shit.

633
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,821
Yeah, it doesn't look good.

634
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,457
What happened?

635
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,559
She moved.

636
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,104
Where?

637
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,696
He doesn't know.

638
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,345
Any forward address?

639
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,279
Sorry, Zia.

640
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,285
At least we know we're
getting closer, right?

641
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,189
Yeah.

642
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,490
You deserve a drink, man.

643
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,171
He's sleeping.

644
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,109
Fucker's always sleeping in the car.

645
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:57,845
What's this button do?

646
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,042
That doesn't work.
No, don't. Don't push that.

647
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,244
That doesn't...

648
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,947
Christ, are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

649
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,059
In-fucking-credible!

650
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,931
What?

651
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,095
Look! Look! Look!

652
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,934
You're a genius.

653
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,098
Oh, it's the headlights...

654
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:30,105
Okay, Eugene. Take it easy.

655
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,841
It's just the headlights, man.

656
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,849
It's great, but it's...

657
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:40,723
Oh, that is beautiful.

658
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,316
Do it again, Eugene.

659
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,190
Yeah?

660
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:47,560
Beautiful.

661
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,191
Eugene, watch out!

662
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:05,113
What happened? Fuck.

663
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,410
Oh, my God.

664
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,115
You all right, Eugene?

665
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,120
Yeah, I'm fine, man.

666
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:13,121
Yeah?

667
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,454
Oh, my God.

668
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:17,482
What the...

669
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,791
Hey. Hey. Hey.

670
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,024
Maybe he's sleeping.

671
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,433
Be careful.

672
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:27,800
Hey.

673
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,805
Hey, man.

674
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,143
You on drugs or something?

675
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,046
Jesus.

676
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,125
I must've dozed off.

677
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,855
I think I slept on my ear wrong.

678
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,388
Do I look asymmetrical to you at all?

679
00:48:56,466 --> 00:49:01,529
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm Raife Kneller.

680
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:06,304
Um... don't call me Raife.

681
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,674
My mom used to call me Raife, and l...

682
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,305
Don't get me started on it.
Just call me Kneller.

683
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:16,148
I lost my dog,
and I'm just sick about it.

684
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:19,052
You haven't seen a dog.
His name's Freddy.

685
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,285
You'd look for him
while laying in the middle of the road.

686
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,657
Well, I had to take a break.

687
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,218
I mean, it's emotional work.

688
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,230
Emotio... In the middle
of the fucking road?

689
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,892
Don't you think that's
a bit irresponsible?

690
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:36,133
Hey, look, it's too late, really,
to continue looking for Freddy.

691
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,138
You know, I, uh...

692
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,335
Why don't we go to my place?

693
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,274
Nothing really is for rent here.

694
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,911
I mean, it was at one time.

695
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:55,516
I rented the place
several years ago, and l...

696
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:59,858
The other thing is
it's not really a camp.

697
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:03,457
It's just a joke a friend of mine
thought would be funny.

698
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,058
I really don't think it's funny.
Do you think it's funny?

699
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,468
I don't. Actually...

700
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,336
Guys. Eugene, Mik, look at that.

701
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:18,472
What?

702
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:25,352
That guy was just floating in the air.

703
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:28,990
Floating?

704
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,549
He was. He was...

705
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,595
I wouldn't pay any attention to it.

706
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,823
It happens all the time around here.

707
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:36,763
What happens? Miracles?

708
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:40,428
Yeah, people floating in the air,

709
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:45,203
like, uh, people turning
stones into plants

710
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:50,042
or changing the color
of different objects.

711
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,671
Fixing the headlights, maybe?

712
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:53,978
What do you mean,
fixing the headlights?

713
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,952
His headlights have
been broken for ages,

714
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,046
and she fixed them not far from here
just by touching a button.

715
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:03,889
Oh. Yeah, something
small and insignificant like that.

716
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,557
Is that another one of your miracles?

717
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:11,761
No, that's Nanuk. She's a mute.

718
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,167
She does this throat singing.

719
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,206
She's hilarious. I'll be right back.

720
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,439
Nanuk, we... we have new guests.

721
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:26,004
That guy was 3 feet off the ground.

722
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,881
Fresh sheets, coffee, and all that.

723
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:31,716
People, Nanuk.

724
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:32,914
Nanuk will look after you.

725
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,549
I got some business.

726
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:39,026
Hey, make sure you
take care of my car, man.

727
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,664
All right, Nanuk.

728
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:45,565
I guess you take care of us.

729
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:59,071
Once upon a time,
there was a crooked tree

730
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:00,878
and a straight tree,

731
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:05,285
and they grew next to each other.

732
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:09,121
And every day the...

733
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:11,387
straight tree would look
at the crooked tree.

734
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,588
He would say, "You're crooked.

735
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,494
"You've always been crooked,

736
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:18,432
"and you'll continue to be crooked.

737
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:21,699
But look at me. Look at me,"
said the straight tree.

738
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:26,037
He said, "I'm tall and I'm straight."

739
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:30,239
And then one day,
the lumberjacks came into the forest

740
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,837
and looked around.

741
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,882
And the manager in charge said,

742
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:39,080
"Cut all the straight trees."

743
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:43,752
And that crooked tree
is still there to this day,

744
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,490
growing strong and growing strange.

745
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:05,241
Just forget about the miracles, Zia.

746
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,476
They don't mean a thing.

747
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:10,213
Everybody in camp
can do that but me.

748
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:12,448
Hey, give yourself a break, man.

749
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:15,418
I'm dying to do one.

750
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:19,428
Just a small one, even if it's stupid.

751
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,157
Here's the deal.

752
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:24,826
As long as you want it so bad,
it's not gonna happen.

753
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:29,167
The only way it's gonna work
is if it doesn't matter.

754
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,969
Here you go, girl.

755
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,135
Drink up, my man.

756
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,803
You know what I'm saying?

757
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,176
I don't know. I guess.

758
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,647
I don't know.
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

759
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,880
It will. It will.

760
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:48,721
Hey, Kneller, do you mind
if I use your truck?

761
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:49,918
'Cause we're out of logs.

762
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:52,518
Sure. You look great in that.

763
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:54,325
I know. I like it.

764
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:59,659
Zia, you wanna go for a ride?

765
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,169
Yeah.

766
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,830
Are you gonna be all right, Kneller?

767
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,033
Go ahead.

768
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,489
It's nice here, right?

769
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,426
Yeah.

770
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,464
You ever miss the things
from before you offed?

771
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,668
No, I don't really remember much.

772
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,267
I think the only thing
I missed is Desiree.

773
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:45,576
Now that she's here,
it's like the only thing I can think about.

774
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,607
I miss everything.

775
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,654
I miss my friends, I miss my dog,

776
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:56,420
I miss my family, my house, everything.

777
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:59,656
I even miss the things I hated at this point.

778
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:01,925
I don't know.

779
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:03,829
It's weird. I had this dream the other night

780
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,269
that I woke up in the hospital
because my... my suicide didn't work.

781
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,875
And while I was there, I just...

782
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:16,744
I just kind of missed this.

783
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:31,187
He's teaching her
how to open a beer with a lighter.

784
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,729
He's teaching her how to open
a beer with a lighter.

785
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:36,129
She doesn't even drink. Let me see.

786
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,427
You see?

787
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,730
Yeah. Yeah.
You should've seen him the other day.

788
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,168
He was trying to teach her

789
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:43,569
the famous basketball players names

790
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,505
and their positions and everything.

791
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,736
She had no clue what he was saying.

792
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:51,008
The secret is that
she's from way too far away

793
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,878
to pick up on his character.

794
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:55,876
- And half her family offed just like his.
- I know.

795
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:59,221
She doesn't live with him, though.

796
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:04,026
Holy shit. He caught a fish.

797
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,291
- Oh, my God, he's doing it.
- What?

798
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,662
He's changing the color of the fish.

799
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,325
With his bare hand,
he's holding the fish,

800
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,800
and he changed the color.

801
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,600
Oh, Zia, when are you gonna
stop being obsessed

802
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:18,072
with those silly little miracles?

803
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:22,743
I don't know.

804
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:26,441
When you stop being obsessed
with all that people in charge shit.

805
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:29,679
That is not the same.

806
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:30,981
Yeah, right, you know,

807
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,147
because you're here
by mistake or whatever.

808
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,622
I'm sorry, I guess I just...

809
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,283
I don't see how
you could possibly be...

810
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,793
You know what, listen, you little jerk.

811
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:41,592
I never killed myself.

812
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,497
I just OD'd.

813
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:26,040
All right, go.

814
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,402
Zia, what are you waiting for?

815
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,606
Come on, man.

816
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,609
Zia, hurry.

817
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:34,877
Ow! Shit.

818
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,919
- Hey, Zia!
- Kneller?

819
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,647
Float on up.

820
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,586
Come on, we gotta go.

821
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:41,681
Float on up.

822
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:42,747
Float?

823
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,453
Come on, man.

824
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,085
I can't.

825
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:48,187
You gonna spend the rest
of your life down there?

826
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:49,731
No, but what if l...

827
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,494
They're gonna be here in a second.

828
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:56,666
No, no, no. Wait! Wait for me!

829
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:02,740
Mom? Dad? What are
you guys doing here?

830
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:03,801
Where have you been all this time?

831
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,781
Why haven't you called us?

832
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:35,171
You're awake?

833
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:40,205
I've been thinking.

834
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,841
If I'm gonna find the people in charge,

835
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,044
I have to keep looking.

836
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,021
I'm not gonna find them here.

837
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,022
You know?

838
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:51,390
Yeah, I think you're right.

839
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,190
I think if I'm gonna find Desiree,

840
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:55,788
I'm gonna have to start
looking elsewhere, too.

841
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,568
We can't wait for Eugene forever.

842
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,734
Yeah, I know.

843
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:13,882
Mom?

844
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:46,880
I found him! I found him!

845
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,815
I found Kneller's dog!

846
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:50,318
I found Freddy!

847
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:53,184
Yan, what happened to you?

848
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:59,852
Messiah King lives
at the other side of the forest,

849
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,523
and he's holding Kneller's dog captive.

850
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,827
What?

851
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,832
And so many people are there,

852
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:08,598
like, hundreds to witness the miracle
he's gonna perform tomorrow.

853
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,332
Freddy's performing miracles?

854
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:12,169
No. Messiah.

855
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:16,177
But not like our miracles.
A planned, significant miracle.

856
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:19,180
Here. You're bleeding.

857
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,311
Well, what about Freddy?

858
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,013
How's Freddy?

859
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:28,847
Yan, is Freddy okay?

860
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,562
Freddy's fine.

861
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,193
They feed him T-bone steak,
and he refuses to come back.

862
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:40,701
Freddy's been brainwashed.

863
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,238
We're driving over there right now.

864
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,864
I only know how to get there on foot.

865
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,909
How far is it?

866
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,173
I'm not sure. I got lost on the way,
but five, six hours, I'd say.

867
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,077
All right, first thing in the morning.

868
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,639
Hey, do you guys mind
if Zia and I tag along with you?

869
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:58,380
Why? You guys are dying to see miracle
that asshole's gonna perform?

870
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,388
Yeah, I wanna go.

871
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:02,583
T-bone?

872
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,093
16 ounce, thick cut.

873
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,924
Damn.

874
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:19,006
Uh, Yan, you sure
we're going the right way?

875
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:21,509
We've been six hours or so.

876
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:24,671
Yes. We should be there soon.

877
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:27,739
I think.

878
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,088
I don't know what happened.

879
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:37,320
I was sure we'd find it before dark.

880
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:47,962
Actually, I think it's a good sign.

881
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:51,803
I mean, you got lost last time, right?

882
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,638
Yeah. You're right.

883
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,406
That's a really good sign.

884
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,683
I hope we at least find
our way back to the camp.

885
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:11,420
Yeah, that'd be nice.

886
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:15,055
I mean, I have no clue where we are.

887
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:17,361
We've been hiking for,
like, 12 hours straight.

888
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:19,765
I mean, I don't really know
how fast we've been going...

889
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,170
What?

890
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,172
- Shh!
- What?

891
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,469
Listen. Listen. Listen.

892
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,106
Do you hear that?

893
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:32,670
Yeah, but...

894
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,910
it sounds like a...

895
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,020
Holy shit.

896
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,523
Let's go.

897
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:53,802
How come no one in camp
ever mentioned the beach is so close?

898
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,770
Maybe they don't know.

899
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,136
Maybe we're the only ones who know.

900
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:02,409
Hi.

901
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,036
Hi.

902
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:11,144
You remember the other day
when you were talking

903
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,180
about missing things
from life and, uh...

904
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:17,817
how you wanted to go back

905
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,226
and I told you I didn't miss anything?

906
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,661
Yeah.

907
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:25,428
Well...

908
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:29,733
when I'm here...

909
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:34,198
with you, I kind of miss myself

910
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,905
the way I used to be.

911
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,140
What were you like?

912
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:42,150
I was... I was happy at a time.

913
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:47,554
Obviously before I came here, but...

914
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:48,555
Yeah.

915
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:51,957
...something about
being here with you

916
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:54,553
reminds me of that.

917
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,895
It's just, I don't know,
it's just weird to me

918
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,527
that you can feel that
in a place like this.

919
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:05,733
We're all... We're all dead.

920
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:09,836
You know what?

921
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:12,142
Most the people that I knew before I got here

922
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:16,345
were either half dead
or just completely dead already.

923
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,853
You know, completely dead.

924
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:22,482
And you're doing pretty good, Zia.

925
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,651
You think so?

926
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,957
Yeah, definitely.

927
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,260
Freaking out.

928
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,233
Fuck. Mik, get up.

929
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,800
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

930
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,907
There they are.

931
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:23,451
I've just been worried sick about you.

932
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:25,316
Careful. Careful. Don't step on it.

933
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:26,878
Put your shoes on.

934
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:29,254
I hope you didn't sleep here.

935
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:31,486
Well, yeah.

936
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:36,759
This is where intravenous drug users
and prostitutes congregated.

937
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:38,697
It was too revolting for them.

938
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,395
Can we get the hell out of here?

939
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,266
Yeah. Careful.

940
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:45,000
I hope Yan doesn't get lost.

941
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,077
Yan's already lost.

942
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,476
Shit.

943
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:52,946
Yan!

944
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:05,724
We're never gonna
make it anywhere now.

945
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,320
I found it! I found it!

946
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:09,557
Where?

947
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,691
Right over the hill. It's real close.

948
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:16,932
Come on, there's music
and cold drinks and dancing girls.

949
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:30,450
Excuse me.

950
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:32,419
Who's in charge here?

951
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,422
The King, of course.

952
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,516
Can you believe how privileged we are?

953
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:39,322
Hmm. Why is that?

954
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,955
Because of the miracle.

955
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:45,762
He will actually separate
his body from his soul.

956
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:48,065
Actually, we're just
looking for our dog.

957
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,399
Guys, I think you should come.

958
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:50,666
Why? What's going on?

959
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,105
Kneller's with the King,
and he's raising hell.

960
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,106
Come on.

961
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,870
Raising hell? Yan, wait.

962
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:57,742
That dog came to me.

963
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:00,213
Begged me to be part
of what we're doing here.

964
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:01,681
Everybody knows that's my dog.

965
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:02,877
Nobody owns a dog.

966
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,852
You kidnapped that dog.

967
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:07,046
Those are very
serious charges, friend.

968
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:09,250
We need to speak to the Messiah.

969
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,589
He's in a meeting.

970
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,059
He's with my friend.

971
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:14,619
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

972
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:15,959
That dog's never been on a leash.

973
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:19,468
That dog wanted to be
on that leash.

974
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,297
Zia?

975
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,136
Desiree.

976
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,008
My God.

977
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:36,144
Oh, my God, I can't believe it's you.

978
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:39,119
I can't believe it's you.

979
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:41,656
You look absolutely the same.

980
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:45,717
Well, almost, right? But you do.

981
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:47,729
I mean, you haven't changed your hair.

982
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:48,729
I always...

983
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:49,822
I know, you love this haircut.

984
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,491
- Yeah.
- I remember.

985
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,501
I remember. How are you, Zia?

986
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,093
I'm good.

987
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,196
Can we deal with
the dog business here?

988
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,571
All right, let's deal with the dog.

989
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:03,373
We are going to deal with the dog.

990
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,146
Don't do that.
You're confusing the dog.

991
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,208
What's your name, Honeysuckle?

992
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:11,719
Come on, Freddy. Come on.

993
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,880
Treat. Treat.

994
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,386
The dog has spoken.

995
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:21,487
I'm tired, and I need to concentrate.

996
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,156
I'll see you at the ceremony.

997
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:26,030
It's gonna be a hell of a show.

998
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:30,068
And then, after you offed,

999
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:33,302
I just cried and cried.

1000
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,502
And I had to leave town

1001
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:37,739
because everything reminded me of you.

1002
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:44,343
Trust me. I never knew
how much I hurt you

1003
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,354
until you were gone.

1004
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:51,589
Oh, thank God.

1005
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,094
Thank God I can finally
ask you to forgive me.

1006
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:02,397
King. King?

1007
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,235
He was a real friend.

1008
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:08,003
He got me out of town,
and I started to get

1009
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,773
more and more into his teachings,

1010
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,575
and I just stopped crying.

1011
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:16,675
So then King was supposed to separate
his body from his soul

1012
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,481
so he could discover
the other, better world

1013
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:21,580
and come back
and show everyone the way.

1014
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,592
'Cause you know he believes

1015
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:29,597
we're all trapped
in the world of the living.

1016
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:34,228
But something went terribly wrong,

1017
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:37,500
and his soul never made it back.

1018
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,371
So at the hospital,

1019
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:43,843
when they confirmed his death...

1020
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:46,143
I heard his soul calling me,

1021
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:50,982
and I just knew...
I knew I had to be with him, so...

1022
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:55,614
...I took the elevator
to the hospital roof...

1023
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,496
and flew.

1024
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:11,895
Oh.

1025
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:16,674
Oh, God, time flies with you, Zia.

1026
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,872
Let's go. King's about to begin.

1027
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:21,940
And this time, I know...

1028
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:24,076
He's gonna make it.

1029
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:27,748
Come on. I have to help King prepare.

1030
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:43,465
You two made up, huh?

1031
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:46,804
Well, I forgive, but I don't forget.

1032
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:50,938
What keeps happening to Yan?

1033
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:52,810
Have you seen Mikal?

1034
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,145
Last time I saw her,
she was talking to the big guy up there

1035
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:56,741
about, you know, going home

1036
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:59,219
and people in charge and the usual.

1037
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:01,119
Right. What'd he tell her?

1038
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:05,251
He said, "I'm taking you all
to a better place."

1039
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:06,555
Asshole.

1040
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:30,045
Don't be alarmed, friends.

1041
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:35,453
The vessel will die soon,

1042
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:38,982
and the spirit will rise.

1043
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:42,690
The first time was only a test...

1044
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:46,861
a precursor to the real thing.

1045
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:48,425
Why don't you just tell her?

1046
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,131
Tell her what?

1047
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:52,264
Tell her that you love her.

1048
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:54,809
Don't be afraid when I leave.

1049
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:57,539
You do, don't you?

1050
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,547
For I will be back to save you all.

1051
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:01,378
It's too far. She won't hear.

1052
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:19,831
What is he doing?

1053
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:26,173
He's bluffing.

1054
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:28,801
Nobody would do that twice.

1055
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:30,902
You know how much that hurts.

1056
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:31,968
Yeah.

1057
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:58,395
Oh, my God.

1058
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:03,537
We're at the compound.
I need backup.

1059
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:09,213
Come right now.
This guy's gone crazy.

1060
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,923
Everyone, look! There he is!

1061
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:23,362
He's coming. He's coming.

1062
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:25,457
They're... They're coming.

1063
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:30,037
Kneller.

1064
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:35,938
Blessings. Blessings.
He's gonna show us the way.

1065
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:39,538
Everyone, keep your hands
lifted up to King.

1066
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:41,105
See us for bruises! Go home!

1067
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:45,244
Everybody, go home!
Everybody, go home!

1068
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,584
Move! Move! Move! Go! Move! Move!

1069
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:51,057
Everybody disperse. This is the P. I.C.

1070
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,560
Go immediately. Everyone.

1071
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:55,722
King? Wait.

1072
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:58,062
Who are you? No, no, no!

1073
01:13:58,133 --> 01:13:59,100
King! King!

1074
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:01,466
Please disperse immediately.

1075
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,004
Please disperse.

1076
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,470
- Yan.
- What the fuck is going on?

1077
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,030
I don't know. Have you seen Mikal?

1078
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,804
She was right here a second ago.

1079
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:10,742
Please disperse.
This is the People In Charge.

1080
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:11,905
Where's Kneller?

1081
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,743
I don't know. I'll be right back.

1082
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:17,752
This is the P. I. C:
the People In Charge.

1083
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,448
I repeat: P. I.C.

1084
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:23,719
People In Charge.

1085
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:29,720
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Evacuate immediately.

1086
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:37,234
Zia! Zia, I'll be back in five minutes.

1087
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,667
Please leave immediately.

1088
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,481
What are you guys doing here?

1089
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,420
Came to pick you up, man.

1090
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:29,980
Yan tell you what happened?

1091
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,650
Kneller did.

1092
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,718
Is Mikal with him?

1093
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:36,195
No.

1094
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:37,459
Did he mention anything about her?

1095
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,263
Not to me. Jump in.

1096
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:42,496
I can't. I gotta stay here
and wait for her.

1097
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:46,063
How long you gonna wait, man?

1098
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:48,371
She's an adult.
She'll find her way back.

1099
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,375
What's Freddy doing here?

1100
01:15:57,452 --> 01:16:00,421
Get in, dickhead.
We have a train to make.

1101
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:03,690
Train?

1102
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,454
Get in.

1103
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,079
So Kneller never did actually kill himself.

1104
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,671
No, of course not.

1105
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,545
He was working for
the People In Charge.

1106
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:31,586
Undercover.

1107
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:34,918
I always had a feeling
he was an angel or something.

1108
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,390
An angel? Come on.

1109
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:38,551
Well...

1110
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,561
So now that he blew his cover,

1111
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:44,565
he'll be transferred
out of the undercover unit.

1112
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:46,191
Transferred? Where's he going?

1113
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,896
Don't know. Wherever
the People In Charge operate.

1114
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:52,570
Looks like that's it.

1115
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,980
So camp is totally over?

1116
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:09,114
Yup.

1117
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:14,390
Turns out Kneller ran it completely illegally.

1118
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,624
And on the P. I.C. property, no less.

1119
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:23,831
So what are you gonna do?

1120
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:26,474
I don't know.

1121
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:28,907
I'm definitely gonna go back to camp
and wait for Mikal,

1122
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:32,310
but after that, I guess I'll see.

1123
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:37,049
You'll see?

1124
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:42,248
What?

1125
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:45,088
Listen.

1126
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,186
I didn't want to tell you this.

1127
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:52,427
According to Kneller, in the middle
of that whole Messiah hassle,

1128
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:56,437
Mikal talked to one of
those P. I.C. guys and...

1129
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,439
and asked him to check her file.

1130
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,407
And I know it sounds crazy,

1131
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:03,603
but it turns out there really was
some kind of mistake,

1132
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,409
and it looks like they'll be sending her back...

1133
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:08,244
back to life.

1134
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:21,794
It's a good thing, you know?

1135
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,524
'Cause she gets to go back.

1136
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,532
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1137
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:27,627
It is.

1138
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,695
I mean, it's what she wanted, so...

1139
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:38,142
Take care of her.

1140
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:47,580
Bye, Nanuk.

1141
01:19:00,635 --> 01:19:02,034
Come here.

1142
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:08,203
See you, man.

1143
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:22,984
Hey, don't forget to give
that package to my folks.

1144
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,130
They went to the North Pole

1145
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:43,371
or whatever the place
Nanuk is from is called.

1146
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,003
He wanted to meet her family

1147
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,980
and get into that throat singing,

1148
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:50,745
saw playing, weird instruments,
and all that stuff.

1149
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:54,152
It's good that he's back into music, I think.

1150
01:20:57,752 --> 01:21:00,050
And me?

1151
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,816
I think I finally understand

1152
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:04,950
what Kneller was trying to say.

1153
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:08,257
It only happens if it doesn't matter.

1154
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:11,589
It comes without effort.

1155
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:17,795
Maybe Eugene's right.

1156
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:22,572
Maybe I only get stuck on girls
I don't have a chance of being with.

1157
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:26,509
I am glad for Mikal, though.

1158
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:29,072
I hope she got her visa
all straightened out.

1159
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:35,617
I mean, she did say
she'd be right back.

1160
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:40,150
Then again, Eugene's old wisdom
is when a girl says that,

1161
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,822
she never does actually come back.

1162
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,800
So I don't know. Go figure it out.

1163
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:48,311
Zia, you are one lucky son of a bitch.

1164
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:53,290
Pays to know people
in high places, huh?

1165
