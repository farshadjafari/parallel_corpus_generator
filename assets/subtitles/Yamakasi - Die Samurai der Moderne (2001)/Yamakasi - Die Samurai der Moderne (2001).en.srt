No.
-A mistake.

56
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,900
That was no mistake,
but very stupid.

57
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,500
Who will fall for that,
will get one week street patrol.

58
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,900

59
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,900
Jean-Michel Lucas alias Tango.

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,600

69
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,200
You wait and see.

70
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,400

71
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,500

Bruno Duris alias the Spider.

72
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,000

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,700

76
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,100

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,100
What are you doing, men?
Put that trampoline back.

82
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,400
Terrible.

83
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,100
Just laugh. But with the next one
you will stop laughing.

84
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,800
Baseball.

85
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,600

Stop the thief. Help.
Stop him.

88
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,400
How is it possible?

89
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,000
They think they are hero's.
-They are criminals.

90
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,300
Buildings are no klimtorens.
-They steal nothing.

91
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,700
It's their hobby.
-o, are we their hobby?

92
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,900
We have got enough work already.
Let them play soccer like everybody does.

93
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,500
Chef...
-silence, Asmine.

94
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,200
We are here to life by the law.
The law says: Do not climb on buildings.

95
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,800
Do not take people out of there bed
and don't make fun at the police.

96
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,900
Is that understood?

97
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,800
And at the end, the last one of the group:
ousmane Bana.

98
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,500
Alias Sitting Bull.

99
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,100
Come on, Sitting Bull.

100
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,000
On a nice day he will fall.
And I wanna see that.

101
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,000
Japan has his seven samoerais,
the VS has seven hirelings...

102
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,300
...and we get the seven jerks.

103
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,600
You will arrest them. The city is no zoo.
And before the end of the week...

104
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,200
...otherwise I will call the special force
and Monday it will be... safari.

105
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,900
Get to work.

106
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,800
Hello, cousin. What brings you here?
Good news?

107
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Good and bad.
-You fired?

108
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,400
not yet.
-oke, and now the good news.

109
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,800
I have no shift now.
I come to talk to you as a friend.

110
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,400
I知 scared now.

111
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,800
In the office they have a big file of you. 
The chef hates you.

112
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,200
That's a compliment.
-Keep quite for a while.

113
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,800
Why don't you go to the mountains?

114
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,900
Nice chalet, pannkeeks
and all day climbing.

115
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,900
Why? We didn't do nothing?

116
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,000
Some people are mad at you.
And what to think about the parents?

117
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,600
why?

118
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,600
The kids admire you.
they are trying to be you.

119
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,500
Bulling the police, that痴 cool.
But you are trained.

120
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,800
One day a boy will fall.
How will you react?

121
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,600
I知 just a little inspector.
My power is small.

122
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,500
Very small.

123
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,400
And with Arabic blood
it will lesser then normal.

124
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,300
If you don't want to work together,
I can do nothing.

125
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,500
Mom is giving a party .

126
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,800
She is making kip-combo. wanna come?

127
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000

128
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,500
we play Yamakasi.
-come.

129
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,500
Come, Djamel.
-I can't. My hart.

130
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,100
That's not true you don't want to climb.
Are you a sissy?

131
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,200
I can't.
-and pee, may you do that?

132
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,900
Are you going to run forever?

133
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,900
Come, let see that you are
a Yamakasi.

134
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,300
Come, everybody is watching.
You can do it.

135
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,000
Proof that you are a Yamakasi.
Its a little three.

136
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,200
And we yel at you.
Djamel. Djamel.

137
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Come on, Djamel.
-Let see that your a Yamakasi.

138
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,300
Come on, Djamel. Climb.

139
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,500
Your almost there.

140
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,700
don't do stupid, your almost there.

141
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,300
Come.

142
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,300
Djamel.

143
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,900
Djamel, no.

144
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,900
Miss El hadj? with Mme Guerin
from school. I wanna talk about Djamel.

145
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,900
Ala, come quick.
It goes about Djamel.

146
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
Good afternoon.

147
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,800
It's all right.

148
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,600
It's all right, It's all right.

149
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,600
This time its worse.
No physical activity.

150
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,100
He has to go to school?

151
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,000
And now? what is going to happen?

152
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
He must have a transplant within
24 hours, and...

153
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,300
no.

154
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,200
He is on the list right?
You said so.

155
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,700
Off course,
but this is complicated, Ala.

156
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,000
he has priority,
but there must be a donor.

157
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,500
on a good moment.
And the list changes every hour.

158
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,300
What can we do?
Can we do nothing?

159
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,200
Come on.

160
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,400
Just as I suspected, nothing in France.

161
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,200
What can we do?
-not much. wait.

162
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,500
Sometimes we get donors very
late. we have to keep hoping.

163
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,300
And outside Of France?

164
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,000
That痴 something else.
That goes by a firm.

165
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,200
We can look for you.

166
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,600
I got one here.

167
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,000
In Swiss.
Dead in a couple of hours.

168
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,400
And there is no option on it.
-What does that means?

169
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,900
That is not reserved..
its available.

170
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,900
In a couple of hours.

171
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,500
And how are going to work for 
that option?

172
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,300
official I can't do anything.

173
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,300
But looking at the fast needs
I could try something.

174
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,300
Try it. we will accept.

175
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Do you know how much it costs?
-no.

176
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,000
Minimum FF 400.000.

177
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,700
We don't have that.

178
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,700
Try the neighbours or friends.
All little things will help.

179
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,100
And the insurance?

180
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,100
The transplantation is covered.
But not the extra things.

181
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,200
I知 willing to help you 
to take the risk.

182
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,100
So, now you have an option on it.
Its reserved.

183
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,700
The little Djamel will get his new hart.
You have till tomorrow afternoon.

184
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,900
The ball is on your side now.

185
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Do you want us dead?
-You don't die from music.

186
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,700
put the noise down a little please,
my head begins to pop.

187
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Take an aspirin.
-I already did.

188
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,900
I can cry about you, wezel.
Really cry.

189
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,300
And, are my mates not cool?

190
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,900
Look out.
-Sorry, let me get the spons.

191
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,500
Why not a mob?

192
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,000
Are those diet pills?

193
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,600
no, for asthma.
halfway diner I have to take them.

194
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,300
your halfway?

195
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,300
I had bought two kilo's of citrus.

196
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,900
They can't leave like that.
Who has mine...

197
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,000
Rocket, I was practicing.

198
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,500
Practice with bananas.
The Cooling is full with it.

199
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,100
You run quickly, but you don't
get faster then light.

200
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,800
Aren't you coming in?
-yes I知 coming.

201
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,600
Is there something?
-A boy fell at school.

202
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,800
Djamel, from the other side.
You know him?

203
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,100
Yes, the brother of Ala.
-he is on the intensive care.

204
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,900
he has a change for one out of thousand.

205
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,000
Did you know how it happened?
-no.

206
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,500
He was climbing a tree.
to follow the bigger boys.

207
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,600
Vincent. what nice to see you
at our house.

208
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,800
why aren't you coming in uniform?
-I知 at the office, Miss Bana.

209
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,300
And you don't have to look nice
at the office?

210
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,300
With one part you don't have enough.

211
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,000
We are not that small.

212
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,600
Is it true?

213
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
We climbed Les Bleuets
in less than 10 minutes.

214
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,500
And as usual I was the fastest.

215
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,600
Me, Rocket.
-Rasta Rocket.

216
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,700
Fast are you sure.

217
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,400
It was fine, but I can't eat anymore.
-Don't you get food at the police office?

218
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,000
How do you want to catch criminals
when they are not affraid?

219
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,300
Fatima, don't.

220
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,900
I don't wanna lose my son.

221
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,100
Fatima, don't do it.
Come back.

222
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,700
It will not matter.

223
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,300
You there downstairs.

224
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,700
Ala.

225
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,600
Fatima.

226
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,900
Mom.

227
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,800
What? I don't want nothing.
My son needs help.

228
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,100
Fatima, go sit down please...

229
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,700
...we will find a way to solve it
for your son.

230
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,700
be careful. Look at me.

231
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,600
Listen...

232
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
we will take care about Djamel.

233
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,400
I swear.

234
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,300
Are you proud of yourself?
You are jerks.

235
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,900
We will save your mother and you will
thank us?

236
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,600
And my little brother?
Who is going to save him?

237
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,700
You with you pirouettes?

238
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,500
Djamel is going to die...

239
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,600
...and it is your fault.
Leave me alone.

240
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,100
We never wanted that.

241
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,300
We do nobody harm.
We only help.

242
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
We helped an old woman with her
purse last time.

243
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,200
Yeah. And she couldn't say
thank you.

244
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,500
We like challenges,
but we are not criminals.

245
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,100
wait a sec.

246
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,700
What? we are not leaders.
we never said that we want look a likes.

247
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,900
we are getting up at 6 o'clock
because nobody will see our work.

248
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,900
Don't do that you are blind.

249
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,600
Kids always do bad things.

250
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,700
they see us and try to be us.
-ok, what痴 the solution?

251
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,700
You quite with it.
-with what?

252
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,700
Climbing. That痴 crap.
-And what must we do then?

253
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,100
Lijm snuiven, destroy cars?
-Don't be a fool.

254
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,900
I知 a fool?
-Are you going to beledigen us more?

255
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,500
Watch out.
-Think on your words.

256
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,600
Shut up.

257
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,800
was tonight not bad enough?

258
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,200
And you would go fight?

259
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,200
what do we do?
-the only thing to do is.

260
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,700
take some responsibility.

261
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,500
who let you in?

262
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,100
we don't want to disturb.
we are coming for Djamel.

263
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,400
Visiting hour is over.
Come back tomorrow.

264
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,200
Its to important.
-It can't.

265
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
When the chef sees you,
you will get punishment.

266
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,200
Michelin?

267
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,200
It doesn't take long.

268
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,500
Can we come in?

269
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,800
Great.
Are you coming to visit me?

270
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,600
Did you really climb Les Bleuets
on the east front?

271
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,600
the news is going fast.

272
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,700
The police will be furious.
-they see green and blue.

273
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,800
Greenblue police, cool.

274
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,400
When I知 older,
may I be a Yamakasi too?

275
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,300
You don't become a Yamakasi of yourself.

276
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,900
But when you池e out of here
and you really want it...

277
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,000
...we will teach you.

278
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,100
Promise.

279
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,100
where are you coming from?
I call you back.

280
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,600
we don't have an appointment.
-Its urgent. The little Djamel.

281
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Right, yes.

282
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,600
what can I say...
-the truth.

283
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,900
you are letting him die.

284
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,400
I took the risk
to get an option.

285
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,500
I don't know what I can do more.

286
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,500
what is money problem?
-Simple.

287
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,900
the hospital can't and may not
pay for the bringing.

288
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,000
I hope that you understand that.

289
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,900
And who are those people?
-A contract firm.

290
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,500
the firm hTC.

291
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,800
And when they give us credits
so we can pay in parts?

292
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,600
Impossible. And I would have to ask
the seven directors first.

293
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,300
seven calls.

294
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,200
I can't call them like that.
-where a will is, is a way.

295
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,600
Try it. Its simple.

296
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,200
no, not on this time of the day.
I can't call because...

297
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
because a child is dying?

298
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,300
I was not saying that.
-Your children?

299
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
Give it.
-they look healthy.

300
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,500
Leave that.

301
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,800
Enough jokes.

302
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,500
In 10 seconds you will leave the room
and in one minute you will leave the hospital.

303
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,200
You get your money.
Tomorrow on 12.00 its on your table.

304
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,200
because of money they let a child die,
and they call us trash.

305
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,300
they deserve a knife in the ribs.

306
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,700
That is not smart.
-you have a better idea?

307
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,100
Everything is better. In this country
we don't leave people die.

308
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,700
Maybe is that in your nice
law books...

309
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,900
...but reality is different.

310
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,600
The city is a jungle.
who has no money can die.

311
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,600
don't become mad. we will
find something. with the banks.

312
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
did you look at our faces?

313
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,200
we don't enter a club,
so never mind a bank.

314
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,000
Unless we have a gun.
-You have one, give it to me.

315
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,100
Give me 2 hours. With my workmates
we will find a solution.

316
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,700
But it has to go legal.

317
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,700
You know, you can do it with the law,
we do it with our heart.

318
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,600
The first one that saves Djamel, wins.
-no stupid things.

319
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,900
I will do what I can.
Promise.

320
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,700
How did you get that?
-Stolen from the doctor.

321
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,800
The seven addresses are in it.

322
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,900
We are going to nail them.
-no violence doesn't solve anything.

323
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,400
That痴 right, but we are going to
get them.

324
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,500
no, better.

325
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
we tell them a story.

326
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,200
Getting money from the rich
for the poor.

327
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,700
Yes, like in the cartoon.
-Robin hood.

328
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,500
Great. The sister of Rachid
has him on video.

329
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,600
Stealing is stealing.
-This is not stealing.

330
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,900
we are giving there own money back.

331
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,700
Great.

332
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,500
I like that.
I like it very much.

333
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,000
Great idea.
Great plan. Nice.

334
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,400
Yes, we get in jail or in the
hospital.

335
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,300
Don't think so low.
Everybody agree?

336
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes.
-and what must I do?

337
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,400
I want to help the little djamel too.

338
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,700
Michelin, you are standing stand-by.
When its going bad we will call you.

339
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,300
Good?
-Cool.

340
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,100
Meeting at 5 0'clock.

341
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,700
You can't sleep inspector?

342
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,900
Do you know how late it is?
-Sorry, yes.

343
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,400
Dad kills you.

344
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,200
There is happend something important.

345
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,600
When we never see each other...
nah, we will see each other, but...

346
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,000
Ah, damn.

347
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,000
Love discussions,
is nothing for me.

348
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,600
You will be proud of me.

349
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,600
we have an idea for Djamel.

350
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,100
But it takes time.

351
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And I知 not there today.
I can't prik today.

352
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,200
What if there's no money?

353
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,200
Jewels, credit cards. No big
or heavy things

354
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,000
The last one is for us together, 10 O'clock.

355
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,500
Two hours a piece should be sufficient, don't rush!.

356
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,300
Observe, go in and disappear.

357
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,200
Michelin, you are staying with the cell-phone.
-I've got 2 new batteries.

358
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,600
half past five.

359
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,500
fourth floor.

360
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Late, that's the kitchen.

361
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,400
You shouldn't eat now
We're going to watch there.

362
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,700
shall we?
-no.

363
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,100
we got 4 hours to save Djamel..

364
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,600
You go left, I go right.

365
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,500
Call the cops.

366
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,100
Fine thank you.
-Good morning.

367
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,800
I want to talk to the minister
-he's not coming today.

368
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,800
and his chief?.

369
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,300
I hear he's at the office early usually?

370
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,700
indeed. Do you have an appointment?

371
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,800
It's about a nine-year-old...
-Do you have an appointment?

372
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,200
No, but it's very urgent.

373
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,900
You need an appointment!
U can order it by filling in an application form.

374
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,700
I really have to...
-I'm sorry..

375
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,700
the protocol has is very strict.

376
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,700
there's a life at stake and you
are arguing about a protocol?

377
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,300
Calm down!

378
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,600
And you call the chief
Am I clear now?

379
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,600
What's happening?
-Sir...

380
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,100
inspector Asmine,
sir the chief.

381
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,200
I知 sorry,
but a child is about to die

382
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,900
Only you can do something.

383
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,500
I didn't know I had so much power.

384
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,700
Please, come to my office.

385
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,000
Okay, after you.

386
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,200
Take a seat.

387
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,000
Yuk!. that guy can paint.

388
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,900
That's much too complicated

389
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,700
No big or heavy stuff.
we have to look for something else.

390
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,400
Yech.

391
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,800
That's awful.

392
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,200
You are bound to dislike music.

393
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,300
Five minute, and flee.

394
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,100
How do you know that?
-Mission Impossible.

395
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,700
There should be a key somewhere.

396
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,400
l know where.

397
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,300
Wait a minute.
We're going to teach him in culture.

398
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,400
"Listen to thick, prick.
That's music!"

399
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,000
A unusual story.
Extraordinary I would say.

400
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,100
That's why I pushed so much
My excuses again.

401
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,700
No, u did the right thing.

402
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,300
We should be at service of our people,
It should be the other way around.

403
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,400
Your initiative is admirable
-Thank you.

404
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,100
I there something that can be done against it?

405
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,500
I shall look at the medics.

406
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,800
Otherwise I will call the air force.

407
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,400
They should have a proper plane
-Thank you, in the name of Djamel.

408
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,100
You池e welcome.

409
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,600
Isn't life wonderful?
A big house like this all by ourselves.

410
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,700
We are scared stiff.

411
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,400
You're terrible.

412
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,900
Everywhere those alarms.
-l will kill those electronics.

413
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,500
Easy.
-Too easy if I say.

414
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,100
Too heavy.
-Too vulnerable.

415
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,600
Too beautiful.

416
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
Oh no.
-Yikes.

417
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,700
Damn.

418
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,300
They are coming from both sides
-What now?

419
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,400
let them come, distance.

420
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,700
More distance.
Now!

421
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,000
I never ich dowgs again.

422
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,400
I said to stay alert.
-30 million peace loving people my ass.

423
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,300
hopefully the other got more.

424
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,200
we're fine after the other.
I'll stay out of this.

425
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,500
Ala, with Vincent.
-Yes?

426
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:18,000
Good news I spoke with the chief
personally

427
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,400
He was extremely touched by our cause..
by Djamel

428
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,300
He would take care of it today.

429
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,300
He can call any minute.
Great isn't it?
hij kan elk moment bellen.

430
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,200
yes, but what is he going to do
exactly?

431
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,100
He gets an army plane and people for us.

432
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,200
Ala?
-Hold on...

433
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,600
Are they going to do all this for Djamel?

434
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,600
yes, he seemed very committed.
Truly.

435
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Are u doubting me?
-It's not you, but the rest.

436
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,500
Stay focused, Ala.
djamel will be save in a few hours.

437
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,900
It's will succees, believe me.

438
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,100
Asmine, what are you doing?
-I値l call you back.

439
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,400
You are a cop,
not a social servant.

440
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,600
You should protect people,
not harass them.

441
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,900
I have talked to an angry chief.

442
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,100
What's wrong with you, insulting
a chief?

443
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,900
I didn't insult him.

444
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,500
You got to a guard and...

445
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,900
...said a lot of bullshit..

446
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,700
That's  not true. I just asked
-I don't care

447
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We don't care about the truth.
Our job is to clean up rubbish.

448
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,100
I don't get it.

449
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,000
Don't be so ignoring, that's hard
-The life of a child is at stake.

450
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,500
And then? we are cops.

451
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,600
Not god, the pope or the doctors without bounds.
We carry out orders.

452
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,100
A child is dieing?
Too bad, but not our cause.

453
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,000
We don't ask you to think.

454
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,700
We are the cement.
And cement doesn't think.

455
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,200
If everybody does his job,
everything goes well. So stay focused.

456
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,300
here, start with this case.

457
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,700
Are u going to operate him?
-No, all good. just routine.

458
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,600
Djamel can't stay in the room
-why?

459
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,300
There are other patients.
He stays here now.

460
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,300
in the lobby?
-It's just for a short time.

461
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,200
We will watch him just as good
-You are pretending if he's already dead.

462
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,500
Diseased are downstairs.
over here they are patients.

463
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,300
We got 5 people for the whole shift.

464
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,700
two heavily wounded are on their way
and we don't have enough space.

465
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,600
is my brother not ill enough?

466
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,100
We can't do anything for him at the moment.

467
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,200
We are helping the ones we can
take care of at the moment.

468
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,300
it's his turn soon.

469
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:00,100
the best you can do is stay calm and stay
with him.

470
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:09,700
Good, boys.

471
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,800
Hello, sir. Police
-Come in please.

472
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,500
You are coming for the burglary?

473
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,000
they didn't take much.
My dogs didn't give them the time.

474
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,600
They came in here,
switched off the alarm....

475
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,900
...and went straight to the living room.

476
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,500
How do u know it wasn't one person?

477
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,900
Because of that.

478
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,600
I have eight of them covering the whole house.

479
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,500
You are secured very well.
-After five burglarys I got fed up with it.

480
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,800
What do you do for a living?
-Surgeon. That's why i'm never at home.

481
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:03,000
Hmm. sluggy boys. real burglars.
-maybe they work in a circus?

482
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,800
May I?

483
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,900
Check if there were similar causes
this morning.

484
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,500
Coffee?
-Please.

485
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,600
For me also.

486
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,800
Can I attach it somewhere?
-Over there.

487
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,600
Thank u.

488
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,500
Great instinct you have.

489
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,800
Hmm.. already four acrobat burglaries 
Since six O'clock.

490
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,700
Till now.

491
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,300
check if the victims are related.

492
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,900
Sports club, carbrand or whatever.

493
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,800
Simple, they are all doctors
-That's what I already thought.

494
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,400
And, are you making any progress?

495
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,600
Yes quite .

496
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,300
Do you know Henri Picard?
-That's a colleague.

497
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,800
Pierre Gautier, Jacques Bernier...
-we are in the same council of commissionars

498
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,900
seven in total.
all at the same firm.

499
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,200
Number seven we see never.
He is the boardchief.

500
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,900
Do you have a printerr?
-three.

501
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,800
Warn the others
that they get a visit.

502
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,600
I go to the board chief.

503
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,500
see you.

504
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,600
the minister falls out of our jurisdiction.
Don't worry.

505
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,700
Makes that sense,
seeing the surroundings?

506
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,000
after your conversation this morning...

507
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,200
you are not here too think,
but to obey.

508
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,900
Yes?
Police,madam.

509
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:16,000
Madam, we are after a burglar.
maybe they will strike here

510
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,800
what? Good God.
-Don't panic.

511
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,500
With us around you don't have to fear
May we?

512
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,700
Yes, go ahead.

513
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,800
Nice.
-Yes, it's a Klimt.

514
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,400
can we look around?
-Yes, sure, go ahead.

515
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,400
Nothing here.
-did they already pass by?

516
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,800
no.
But to protect is better than too cure.

517
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,900
when we do our job...

518
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,400
...we do it thoroughly.

519
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,000
Nobody around it seems.

520
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,300
Everything痴 okay it seems.
I知 saying: it seems.

521
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,200
We should be careful, they are fast.

522
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,600
And if you consider their pace..

523
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,200
they aren'dagnerous?
-You never know.

524
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,900
Everything searched?
-you can sleep on both ears.

525
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,700
Madam.
-What if they do come?

526
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,500
The builing is surrounded.
they won't get any further that 10meter.

527
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,500
not even a mouse will slip through.

528
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,200
Thank u.
I feel comfortable.

529
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,800
Just doing our job, madam.

530
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:27,300
Ten minutes extra
And i get her flat and in extacy.

531
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,100

-Police. Don't move.

01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:38,000
And you? did you speak with the minister?

580
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,000

-l can't let you go

582
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,300

585
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,900
Please let us pass.
-If you cross now, it would't end nice.

586
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,400
They will open fire.
You get in a coffin.

587
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,100
You're not Clint Eastwood.

588
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,200
Shut up, Rasta-Rocket.

589

01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,100
you don't get anything do you?

591
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,800
There's friendship, but there's law also.

592
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,400
if I betray my principles,
I have nothing anymore.

593
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,100
Our principles keep us going.

594
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,900
And they give selfrespect.
-Do you get it?

595
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,400
It's they same way with us.

596
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,800
A few rich doktors don't decide
a boys future.

597
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,100
we carry out our idea's...
-Without them we are nothing.

598
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,500
...we regret our whole life.
-there are other solutions than stealing.

599
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,300
Shut up, check your watch.

600
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,400
We see Ala and her mother daily.

601
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:44,400

602
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,300

Wow, what a house...

605
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,700
i can put my half flat in this.

606
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,100
It will cost a day to open all doors.

607
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,400
we spread us.
Meeting outside in 5 minutes.

608

Three teams with walkie-talkie.

617
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,600
Look out.
-Take cover.

618
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,400

619
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,700
In the closet.

620
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,400
The police is everywhere.

621
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,200

-This is not going good.

622
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,900
they are everywhere.
-I ratter have dogs.

623
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,800
we got a emergency plan right?
-we will keep searching for it.

624
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,400
"heavly armed",
isn't that special?

625
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,000
we don't if they shot.

626
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,800
It will be the cleaner then.

627
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,900
Go back to Vitry
and let us do our job.

628
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,100

629
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,500

632
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,100

I asked you to leave.

633
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,000
How? Everything is blocked.

634
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,300
Commissaris orsini.
I lead this operation.

635
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,600
lnspecteur Asmine caught
the burglers and called u and us.

636
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,700
we have them surrounded.
-so they are still in the house?

637
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:28,100
Let them first steal everything
before we kick them?

638
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:32,200
offcourse not. But an interventie
like this needs preparation.

639
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,600
Is there any personel in the hous?

640
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:39,600

I want an attack.

641

663
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,100
carefull.
There can still be civilians in the house.

664

711
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:06,700
I will die on your feed,
but you will not get promoted.

712
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,800
Commissaris, I saw two shadows on
the second floor.

713
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,500

No problem.
-Your turn, Baseball.

01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,400

719
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,400
They are on the roof.

720
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,400
Yankee 0, visiters 1 .

721
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,100

that you better keep in mind.

722
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,700

723
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,800
Situation under control.
no victims.

724
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,400
Finally. I was getting mad.

725
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,600
Thnx, Asmine.
Come with us for the report.

726
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,600
It will be needed,
against the kabinetschef.

727
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,700
forward, men.

728
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,800
Are you comming?

729
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,100
I have my own car.

730
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,700
drive.

731
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,200
I have good news.
the swiss donor died.

732
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:24,400
we have to answer within 1 hour
otherwise the hart will be unusefull.

733
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,900
How much many do you have now?

734
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:35,100
The money is underway.
At 12 o'clock its here.

735
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,600
Nice.

736
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,500
That is not looking good.

737
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,300
lndiaan with your plans,
How do we come out of this?

738
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,100
It was jail or hospital.
-I had choose hospital.

739
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,700
after the hospital it went
jail also.

740
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:05,100
I hope it was not for nothing
and that Djamel is going to make it.

741
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,000
Don't make illusions.
-why?

742
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:12,000
That fatass will lose the money
before he is in the hospital.

743
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,000
how much do you want?

744
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,000
FF 227.500.
-for everything?

745
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,000
yes, and now penny less.

746
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:42,600
it's a lot of money,
but it's for a good cause.

747
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,200
If it's for a good cause,
we got a deal.

748
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,000
Deal.

749
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,900
Come with me.
The boss wants to talk to you.

750
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,600
Tell. We listen.

751
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,800
I wanted to go to Paris with a friend
just to get out.

752
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:18,100
In the suburbs the air is not the best.

753
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,400
We were walking to a good neighbourhood.
We like to come there.

754
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,400
It's like a museum.
-and free.

755
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,200
We passed a beautifull villa.
-Pure luxiory.

756
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,400
Cinderella's castle.
-And then...

757
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,100
we heard screams.
-A yel.

758
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,600
As if they were trying to strangle Cinderella
-we didn't hesitate.

759
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,600
We acted.
-and could call the cops.

760
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,800
But we're not like that.
-Excuse us.

761
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:42,200
The cops scare our pitbulls.

762
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,300
We climb over the fence
-to save the woman.

763
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,000
A window was open
-There were 2 burglars

764
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,900
Three burglars.
-At least five.

765
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,000
Bold headed guys
-Maybe six even.

766
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,500
They were hitting the poor woman.
-they threw her into the closet.

767
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,400
We attaced.
-and beat the crap out of them.

768
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,900
Hard.
Uou would have done the same thing.

769
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,400
Then we heard sirens.
-cops everywhere.

770
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,100
The two burglars ran away.

771
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,200
We realised that noone
would believe us.

772
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:11,800
And your collegues started shooting.

773
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:15,100
Without being able to say anything...
-we pannict.

774
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,500
You are kidding me right?
It's true, I swear.

775
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,200
On my mother
-on my brother.

776
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,200
On my 2 brothers
-On everyone I know.

777
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,300
Not on my father he's dead.
-On my family.

778
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,200
I would spit on the floor
if you wouldn't get angry.

779
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,900
To the jail.

780
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,000
Have you ever read such nonsense?

781
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:41,400
Sadly, it's the truth.
I'll back that as a witness.

782
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:49,100
That'll make the case easier.
I hope he has some good insurance.

783
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,200
Let's hope so.

784
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:59,100
Hey, seven dwarfs. Get out.

785
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:02,100
Get out i said!
You can go.

786
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,600
The inspector backed your story up.

787
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,800
Hurry before he changes his mind.

788
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,000
Ala, I got it.

789
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,500
Ala, I got it.

790
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,400
I got it Ala.

791
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,300
Here, count it.

792
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,600
I believe you.
-FF 400.000 in cash, before noon.

793
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,800
You can call.
There is no time to waste.

794
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:52,300
Yeah, but it's 10 past twelve.

795
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,700
Ten minutes late, I'm sorry.
Take the phone and call your friends.

796
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,600
They got a offer for FF 500.000.

797
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,100
The offer got prosponed until 12.05,
but no longer.

798
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,400
I'm sorry.

799
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,200
Are you sure?

800
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:27,200
You tried everyting
because our patience is running out.

801
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,900
Back up.

802
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,800
I will shoot if I have to.
Get lost or I'll call the cops.

803
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,300
The cops are already here.

804
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,600
I'll come closer so you can read.

805
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,100
Am I close enough? Can you read it?

806
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,200
You see whats on it?
Federal Police.

807
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,400
Put your gun down.

808
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:17,400
Aim a weapon without this card
is punishable by 1 year of prison.

809
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,300
Buit we'll forget the cops for a while,
to have a man-to-man talk.

810
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,900
How much is is your life worth?
FF 20.000 ?

811
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,700
Let's be generous,
FF 100.000.

812
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,100
And 400.000, that's 500.000.

813
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,400
Exactely the right amount.

814
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,700
If Djamel doesn't have a new heart
in two hours...

815
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,300
...yours will get smashed.
You understand?

816
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,100
Turn it of, we can't hear anything.

817
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,700
I'm proud of you.
-I know.

818
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,200
Be carefull with your jacket.
-Nutcase.

819
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:37,900
I have some good news.
-You got fired?

820
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,300
Even better. I quit.

821
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:56,300
I'll make a cassette for Djamel.
you wanted to say something?

822
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,800
can you see us?
-Everything okay?

823
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,500
And leave the nurses alone.

824
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:04,600
get better fast,
because your training is afterwards.

825
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,800
Yamakasi.
