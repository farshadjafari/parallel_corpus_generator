1
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,600
Gentlemen, cock your pistols.

2
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,700
Barry's father had been bred,
like many sons of genteel families...

3
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
...to the profession of the law.

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,400
There is no doubt he would've made
an eminent figure in his profession...

5
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,099
...had he not been killed in a duel...

6
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,500
...which arose over the purchase
of some horses.

7
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,799
Barry's mother,
after her husband's death...

8
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,900
...lived in such a way
as to defy slander.

9
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,000
Many a man who had been charmed
by the spinster...

10
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:45,500
...renewed his offers to the widow.

11
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,200
But she refused all proposals
of marriage...

12
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,799
...declaring that she lived
only for her son...

13
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,700
...and the memory of her departed saint.

14
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,400
First love! What a change
it makes in a lad.

15
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,800
What a magnificent secret it is
he carries with him!

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,699
The tender passion gushes out
of a man's heart.

17
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,400
He loves as a bird sings...

18
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,599
...or a rose blows from nature.

19
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,900
Killarney.

20
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,800
Now, what shall it be?

21
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,599
Turn around and face the wall.

22
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,900
The object of Barry's attention, and...

23
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,199
...the cause of his early troubles...

24
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,599
...was his cousin,
Nora Brady by name.

25
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,199
I have hidden my neck ribbon
somewhere on my person.

26
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,900
If you find it, you can have it.

27
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,199
You are free to look anywhere for it.

28
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,699
I will think little of you
if you do not find it.

29
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,500
I cannot find it.

30
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
You haven't looked properly.

31
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,500
I cannot find it.

32
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,199
I'll give you a hint.

33
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,800
I feel the ribbon.

34
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,300
Why are you trembling?

35
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,800
At the pleasure of finding the ribbon.

36
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Liar.

37
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,199
About this time the United Kingdom
was greatly excited...

38
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,399
...by the threat...

39
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:54,899
...of a French invasion.

40
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,899
The noblemen and people of condition...

41
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:00,199
...loyally raised regiments...

42
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,899
...to resist the invaders.

43
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,600
Their scarlet coats and swaggering airs
filled Barry with envy.

44
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,399
Brady Town sent a company to join...

45
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,399
...the Kilwangen Regiment
of which John Quin was the Captain.

46
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,100
The whole country was alive
with war's alarums...

47
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:39,899
...the kingdoms ringing
with military music.

48
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,200
Redmond, what is the matter?

49
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,100
Were you obliged to dance
five times with Captain Quin?

50
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't care a fig for Captain Quin.

51
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:35,399
He dances prettily,
and is a pleasant rattle of a man.

52
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,500
He looks well in his regimentals.

53
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,200
He asked me to dance.
How could I refuse him?

54
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,799
But you refused me.

55
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
I can dance with you any day.

56
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,899
To dance with my cousin looks as though
I could find no other partner.

57
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,600
Besides, Captain Quin is a man.

58
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,000
You're only a boy and penniless.

59
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,700
If I meet him again,
you will find out who is the best man.

60
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,299
I'll fight him Captain as he is.

61
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh, don't be so silly!

62
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,299
I mean it.

63
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,000
But Captain Quin is known
as a valiant soldier.

64
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,399
It is mighty well of you
to fight yokels...

65
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,399
...but to fight an Englishman
is a different matter.

66
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
You best have him take you home.

67
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,399
Redmond!

68
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,100
Barry resolved never to see Nora again.

69
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,000
But such resolutions,
steadfastly held for a whole week...

70
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,399
...are abandoned
in a few moments of despair.

71
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,600
No, Nora, no, except for you
and four others...

72
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,100
...I vow before all the gods my heart...

73
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:14,000
...has never felt the soft flame.

74
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:19,100
Ah, you men, you men, John...

75
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,899
...your passion's not equal to ours.

76
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,500
We are like some plant I've read of.

77
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,399
We bear but one flower and then we die.

78
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,100
You, you, you mean you...

79
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,700
...never felt an inclination for another?

80
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:39,899
Never, my John.
How can you ask such a question?

81
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,200
Oh, darling Norelia!

82
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,399
Nora was chaperoned by her brothers
Mick and Ulick...

83
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,600
...whose interests would be affected...

84
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,299
...by the favourable outcome
of her affair with Quin.

85
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,299
Redmond, how nice to see you.

86
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Redmond!

87
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,100
How could you do this to me?

88
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,600
Redmond, what's the matter?

89
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,100
What are you saying?

90
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,200
I think this might be the moment
to return something to you.

91
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:32,799
Thank you, Redmond.

92
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,399
I must have forgotten it.

93
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,799
Yes, you did.

94
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,799
Captain Quin, may I introduce
my cousin, Redmond Barry.

95
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Miss Brady, it would appear...

96
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,799
...you both have something
private to discuss.

97
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,200
It would be best for me to withdraw.

98
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,100
Captain Quin, I have nothing private
to discuss with my cousin.

99
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,700
Miss Brady, it appears you have
a great deal to discuss.

100
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,700
Captain Quin, he don't signify any more
than my parrot or lapdog.

101
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,799
Indeed!

102
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you in the habit of giving...

103
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,899
...intimate articles of your clothing
to your parrot or lapdog?

104
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,200
Mayn't I give a bit of ribbon
to my own cousin?

105
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,399
You're welcome, miss.

106
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,500
As many yards as you like.

107
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,299
When ladies make presents to gentlemen,
it's time for other gentlemen to retire.

108
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:28,399
I wish you both a good day.

109
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,600
Jack Quin!

110
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,500
What's the matter?

111
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,100
I'll tell you, sir.

112
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:36,500
I've had enough of Miss Brady
and your Irish ways.

113
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,100
What is it?

114
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,799
We'll accustom you to Irish ways,
or we'll adopt English ones.

115
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,200
It is not the English way
for ladies to have two lovers.

116
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,700
And so, I'll thank you to pay me
the sum you owe me.

117
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,899
And I resign all claims
to this young lady.

118
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,500
If she fancies schoolboys,
let her take 'em, sir.

119
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,600
You're joking!

120
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,100
I never was more earnest.

121
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,600
John, wait.

122
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,799
Meddling brat!

123
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Your hand is in everybody's pie!

124
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,299
What business have you to quarrel
with a gentleman of substance?

125
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,799
Redmond, me boy, take a seat.

126
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,100
Mrs. Brady and ladies, if you please.

127
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,500
This sort of toast is drunk
too seldom in my family...

128
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,700
...and you'll please to receive it
with all honours.

129
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,799
Here's to Captain and Mrs. John Quin
and a long life to them.

130
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:47,299
Kiss her, Jack,
for faith you've got a treasure.

131
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,399
Come on, Jack.

132
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,299
There's the man!

133
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:04,200
A long and happy life together.

134
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,599
A long and happy life together.

135
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,500
Thank you.

136
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,799
Redmond!

137
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,900
Here's my toast to you,
Captain John Quin.

138
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,700
Redmond, how dare you behave like that
in my house!

139
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,000
Mrs. Brady, take the children out.

140
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,700
My dear fellow, are you all right?

141
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,200
In heaven's name,
what does all the row mean?

142
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,599
The fact is, sir...

143
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,099
...the young monkey's in love with Nora.

144
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,400
He found her and the Captain
in the garden today.

145
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:01,500
Now he's for murdering Jack Quin.

146
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:05,700
Mr. Brady, I've been insulted grossly
in this house.

147
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm not satisfied
with these ways of going on.

148
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:11,900
I'm an Englishman!
And a man of property!

149
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,299
And this impudent young swine...

150
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,700
...should be horsewhipped!

151
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:19,599
Mr. Quin can have satisfaction
any time he pleases...

152
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,799
...by calling on Redmond Barry,
Esquire of Barryville.

153
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,799
I'll see the boy home.

154
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,599
A pretty day's work, Master Redmond.

155
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,900
Knowing your uncle is distressed
for money...

156
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,200
...trying to break off a match which
will bring Ł1,500 a year into the family...

157
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,400
Quin has promised to pay off the Ł4,000
which is bothering your uncle.

158
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,299
He takes a girl without a penny...

159
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,900
...a girl that's flinging herself
at the head of every man in these parts.

160
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,900
And missing them all!

161
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,200
And you, who ought to be attached
to your uncle as to your father...

162
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:11,299
I am.

163
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,799
And this is the return
you make for his kindness?

164
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,700
Didn't he harbour you
when your father died?

165
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,900
Hasn't he given you and your mother
a fine house, rent free?

166
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,200
Mark this, and come what will of it...

167
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,299
...I will fight the man who pretends
the hand of Nora Brady.

168
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,500
I'll follow him if it's into the church
and fight him there.

169
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,099
I'll have his blood, or he'll have mine.

170
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,400
Faith, and I believe ye!

171
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,900
I never saw a lad more game in me life.

172
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:49,799
Give me a kiss, me boy.

173
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,599
You're after me own soul.

174
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,700
As long as I live, you shall never want
a friend or a second.

175
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,099
Will you take my message to him?
And arrange a meeting?

176
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,299
Well, if it must be, it must.

177
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:18,799
Look here, Redmond, me boy,
this is a silly business.

178
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,299
The girl will marry Quin, mark my words.

179
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,000
And as sure as she does,
you'll forget her.

180
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,799
You're but a boy and Quin is willing
to consider you as such.

181
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,400
Right, Quin?

182
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yes.

183
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Now, Dublin's a fine place.

184
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,599
If you've a mind to ride there
and see the town for a month...

185
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,400
...here's ten guineas at your service.

186
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,400
Will that satisfy you, Captain Quin?

187
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,799
Yes, if Mr. Barry will apologize
and go to Dublin...

188
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,400
...I will consider the whole affair
honourably settled.

189
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,299
Say you're sorry, Redmond.

190
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,099
You can easily say that.

191
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,700
I'm not sorry.

192
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,000
And I'll not apologize.

193
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,599
And I'd as soon go to Dublin as to hell.

194
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,700
Then there's nothing else for it.

195
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,099
God bless you.

196
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,200
This isn't my pistol.

197
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,099
It's all right, it's one of mine.

198
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,700
Yours will serve, if it's needed,
for the next round.

199
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,000
Good luck, Redmond.

200
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,200
Gentlemen...

201
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,900
...cock your pistols.

202
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,200
Gentlemen...

203
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,900
...aim your pistols.

204
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:53,299
One.

205
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:56,799
Two.

206
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:00,400
Three.

207
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,599
Is he dead?

208
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:16,799
Quite dead.

209
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,599
This has been a sad day's work
for our family.

210
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,599
Ye've robbed us of 1,500 a year.

211
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,099
Now you'd better ride off
before the Police are up.

212
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,599
They'd wind of this
before we left Kilwangen.

213
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:38,200
Come on, Redmond, I'll go home with you.

214
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,000
How different Barry's fate
might have been...

215
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,900
...had he not fallen in love
with Nora...

216
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,400
...and had he not flung the wine
in Captain Quin's face.

217
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:12,400
But he was destined to be a wanderer.

218
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,299
And the battle with Quin set him
on his travels at an early age...

219
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,799
...as you shall soon see.

220
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,799
The boy must go into hiding
for a short time, anyway.

221
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Dublin's the best place for him.

222
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,700
He can stay there
'til matters have blown over.

223
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,900
But the child has never been
away from home before.

224
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,900
Wouldn't he be as safe here?

225
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,900
I wish that were true, Aunt Belle.

226
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,799
But the Bailiffs may be
on their way already.

227
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,599
Now, Dublin is five days ride
away from here.

228
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,200
There's not a soul who'll know him there.

229
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:52,299
I don't want to harp
on unpleasant matters...

230
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:56,599
...but you do know what can happen
to him if he's taken.

231
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:06,700
I'll be all right.

232
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,200
I'll be all right in Dublin, Mother.

233
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:49,900
No lad with liberty for the first time,
and 20 guineas in his pocket...

234
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:51,599
...is very sad.

235
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,500
Barry rode towards Dublin
thinking not so much of...

236
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,000
...the kind mother left alone,
and the home behind him...

237
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,000
...but of tomorrow
and all the wonders it would bring.

238
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,099
Excuse me, miss.

239
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,099
Would it be possible to have
a drink of water?

240
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,200
Good day to you, young sir.

241
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Good day.

242
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,599
Will you join us in a drink?

243
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,900
No, thank you.

244
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Would you like something to eat?

245
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,599
That's very kind of you,
but I have to be on my way.

246
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:01,900
Thank you.

247
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Goodbye.

248
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,400
Excuse me, sir.

249
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,700
Good morning again, young sir.

250
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,799
Don't even think about it.

251
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
Get down off that horse.

252
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:28,500
Raise your hands above your head, please.

253
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,900
Come forward.

254
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,299
Stop.

255
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,700
How do you do. I'm Captain Feeney.

256
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,200
Captain Feeney!

257
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,799
Captain Feeney, at your service.

258
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,200
The Captain Feeney?

259
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,099
None other.

260
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,000
May I introduce you to my son... Seamus?

261
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,099
To whom do I have
the honour of speaking?

262
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,700
My name's Redmond Barry.

263
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,400
How do you do, Mr. Barry?

264
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,599
Now we must get onto the more
regrettable stage of our brief acquaintance.

265
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,799
Turn around and keep your hands
high above your head, please.

266
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:55,200
There must be 20 guineas
in gold here, Father.

267
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,200
You seem to be a very well set up
young gentleman, sir.

268
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,200
Captain Feeney, that's all the money
my mother had in the world.

269
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,700
Mightn't I keep it?

270
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,400
I'm just one step ahead
of the Law myself.

271
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,099
I killed an English Officer in a duel, and
I'm going to Dublin until things cool down.

272
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,099
Mr. Barry...

273
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,500
...in my profession
we hear many such stories.

274
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,299
Yours is the most intriguing and touching
I've heard in weeks.

275
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,500
Nevertheless,
I cannot grant your request.

276
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,000
But, I'll tell you what I will do.

277
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,400
I'll allow you to keep those fine boots,
which normally I would have for myself.

278
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,700
The next town is only five miles away.

279
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,400
And I suggest you now start walking.

280
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,500
Mightn't I keep my horse?

281
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,599
I would like to oblige you...

282
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,099
...but, people like us must be able
to travel faster than our clients.

283
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,799
Good day, young sir.

284
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,000
You can put down your hands now,
Mr. Barry.

285
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:40,000
Gale's Regiment of Foot, commanded
by Lieutenant General Charles Gale...

286
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,700
...which has distinguished itself
during the recent troubles...

287
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,700
...wants several men to supply
the places of those veterans...

288
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,299
...who have deserved to be pensioned
at one shilling a day.

289
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,099
All clever young fellows
who are free and able...

290
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:01,400
...and are ambitious of becoming
gentlemen by bearing arms...

291
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,099
...are hereby invited to meet
the Recruiting Officer...

292
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:08,799
...who promises that they shall meet
with every encouragement...

293
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,000
...that merit and good behaviour
can entitle them to.

294
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:16,299
Those meeting the qualifications
will immediately receive...

295
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,700
...His Majesty's Royal Bounty
of one and a half guineas...

296
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,900
...with complete clothing, arms
and accoutrements.

297
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,700
King George and Old England forever.

298
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
For a young man in difficulty...

299
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,900
...who had killed a man in a duel and
was anxious to find refuge from the Law...

300
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:49,500
...the chance to earn distinction
in the European wars...

301
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,799
...seemed a stroke of good fortune.

302
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,700
And King George needed men too much
to heed from whence they came.

303
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,400
Hey, lad! Lad!

304
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Can I have a new beaker?
This one is full of grease.

305
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,699
Covered in grease! Give the gentleman
a towel and a basin of turtle soup.

306
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,199
If you want to vex him,
ask him about his wife...

307
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:16,300
...the washerwoman, who beats him.

308
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:20,800
Mr. Toole, is it a towel
of your wife's washing?

309
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,599
They say she wipes your face
often with one.

310
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,500
Ask him why he wouldn't see her
yesterday when she came here.

311
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,900
Mr. Toole, why did you hide
when Mrs. Toole came to visit you?

312
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,000
Afraid of getting your ears boxed?

313
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,599
Gentlemen, you may fight it out
with fists if you choose.

314
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:47,699
We'll form a square for that purpose.

315
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:01,099
Gentlemen, step this way, please.

316
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,900
Shake hands.

317
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,300
Shake hands.

318
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,800
Take your stance.

319
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,500
No biting, kicking or scratching.

320
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,099
The last man to remain standing
is the winner.

321
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,800
Gentlemen, commence fighting, now!

322
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,599
Barry's training continued at the camp.

323
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:46,300
Within a month he was transformed
into a proper young soldier.

324
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,400
The Regiment's strength
was steadily increased...

325
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,500
...by the arrival of other troops...

326
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,599
...in preparation for joining
their armies fighting in Germany.

327
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:01,000
One occasion...

328
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,500
...brought the welcome appearance
of his second in the fatal duel...

329
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,300
...Captain Grogan.

330
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,699
It would have helped if we'd known
what had become of you.

331
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,500
Didn't you think of writing
to your mother?

332
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,000
Of course.

333
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,599
But the shame I felt of losing
her money...

334
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:44,800
...my father's sword and pistols...

335
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,300
I couldn't tell her.

336
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,500
She wouldn't care about those things.

337
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,300
You are her only concern.

338
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,099
Tonight you must write her
a proper letter.

339
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:01,500
Tell her that you're safe and well.

340
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,900
I will.

341
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:14,500
Is Miss Brady well?

342
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,400
There are only six Miss Bradys now.

343
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,599
Has something happened to Nora?

344
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,900
She took on so about your going away...

345
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,699
...that she had to console herself
with a husband.

346
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,500
She is now Mrs. John Quin.

347
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,500
Mrs. John Quin?

348
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:49,000
Was there another John Quin?

349
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:50,599
No.

350
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:54,000
The same, me boy.
He recovered from his wound.

351
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:01,099
The shot you hit him with could not
hurt him. It was made of tow.

352
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Tow?

353
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,900
The Bradys wouldn't let you kill
1,500 a year out of the family.

354
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,099
The plan of the duel was arranged
in order to get you out of the way.

355
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:19,500
The cowardly Quin couldn't
be brought to marry...

356
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,300
...from fear of you.

357
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,199
But hit him you certainly did, me lad.

358
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,199
With a fine thick plugget of tow.

359
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:31,800
He was so frightened,
it took him an hour to come to.

360
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,199
Are you in want of cash?

361
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,699
You may draw on me. For I got
a couple of hundred from your uncle.

362
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,099
While that lasts, you shall never want.

363
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:56,199
It would require a great historian
to explain the causes...

364
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,800
...of the Seven Years' War in Europe...

365
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,800
...to which Barry's regiment
was now on it's way.

366
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,699
Let it suffice to say,
that England and Prussia were allies...

367
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,300
...and at war against...

368
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,300
...France, Sweden, Russia and Austria.

369
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:28,900
Barry's first taste of battle...

370
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,599
...was only a skirmish against
a rearguard of Frenchmen...

371
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:35,199
...who occupied an orchard
beside a road...

372
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,099
...down which the English main force
wished to pass.

373
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,699
Though this encounter is not recorded
in any history book...

374
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,699
...it was memorable enough
for those who took part.

375
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,400
I've only a hundred guineas
left to give you...

376
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,300
...for I lost the rest at cards.

377
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:15,300
Kiss me, me boy,
for we'll never meet again.

378
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:51,599
It is well to dream of glorious war
in a snug armchair.

379
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,500
It is a different thing
to see it first hand.

380
00:45:56,699 --> 00:46:01,699
After his friend's death, Barry's thoughts
turned from military glory...

381
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:04,800
...to those of escaping the Service...

382
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,599
...to which he was tied for six years.

383
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,800
Gentlemen talk of the Age of Chivalry...

384
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,599
...but remember the ploughmen,
poachers and pickpockets they lead.

385
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:34,000
It is with these sad instruments
great warriors and kings...

386
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:37,199
...have been doing their murderous work
in the world.

387
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:50,300
Barry could not have fallen
into worse circumstances...

388
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,699
...than those in which he found himself.

389
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,099
But fate did not intend he should
remain long an English soldier.

390
00:46:57,699 --> 00:46:59,300
An accident occurred...

391
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,099
...which took him out of the Service
in a rather singular manner.

392
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,599
Freddie, I hope you won't be angry
with me, but...

393
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:38,500
...I've got something to tell you
which you won't be happy about.

394
00:47:39,699 --> 00:47:40,900
What is it?

395
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,500
First, promise me
you'll keep your temper.

396
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:49,500
Jonathan, don't be an ass!
You're making a big mystery of it.

397
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,300
What is going on?

398
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,400
I have to go away again.

399
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:56,800
For about two weeks.

400
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,199
Oh, God, you're not serious?

401
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,400
I am. There's nothing I can do about it.

402
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,800
Where to this time?

403
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:11,500
To Bremen, carrying important despatches
to Prince Henry.

404
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,699
But you promised me last time
it would be never again.

405
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,699
I know. And I've kept my part
of the bargain, but...

406
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,699
...Pontersby insists I'm the only one
who can be entrusted with the trip.

407
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:29,199
Here was the opportunity to escape from
the Army for which he had been searching.

408
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:35,400
It was only a few miles to the area
occupied by their Prussian allies...

409
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,599
...where this Officer's uniform
and papers...

410
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,400
...should allow him to travel
without suspicion...

411
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,599
...and to stay ahead of the news
of his desertion.

412
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,800
Then, we'll have little time together.

413
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,099
Are you cross with me?

414
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:56,400
Damn you, I can't stay cross
with you for long.

415
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,699
Oh, Jonathan...

416
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,000
...at times like this I realize
how much I care for you...

417
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:07,400
...and how empty life would be
without you.

418
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,900
Frederick!

419
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:37,099
Barry was glad to see the uniforms
of the Prussian Infantry.

420
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:42,199
They showed him that he was
out of English occupied territory.

421
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,900
His intention was to make for Holland...

422
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,400
...almost the only neutral country
in Europe, in those times...

423
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,400
...and thence to get a passage home,
somehow.

424
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,800
As he rode away...

425
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:03,099
...Barry felt he was now
in his proper sphere.

426
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:07,699
And determined never again
to fall from the rank of a gentleman.

427
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,300
Excuse me, miss.

428
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,300
Yes.

429
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,800
Good day.

430
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:32,699
Good day.

431
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:36,099
Do you speak English?

432
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:40,800
I'm speaking little.

433
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,699
I have not eaten all day, no food.

434
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:52,000
Is there an inn nearby
where I might have a meal?

435
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,000
No... I don't think so.

436
00:50:57,699 --> 00:51:02,099
There is nothing to eat before Grunberg.

437
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,099
Do you live near here?

438
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,300
Yes.

439
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:19,599
Would you... feed me?
I'd be happy to pay you.

440
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:24,400
I think so.

441
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:50,599
Is it a boy or girl?

442
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,400
A boy.

443
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,800
What's his name?

444
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,900
Peter.

445
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,500
How old is he?

446
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:03,199
He's one year old.

447
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:08,300
Where is Peter's father?

448
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,900
Where he is?

449
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Yes.

450
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,199
In the war.

451
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,699
How long has he been gone?

452
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,199
Sorry... I didn't understand.

453
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:31,900
What?

454
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,500
Oh! A long time.

455
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:40,599
Since springtime.

456
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:48,400
It must be hard for you to be alone.

457
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,300
It is.

458
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,300
It must be dangerous for you in the war.

459
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,400
I'm an Officer and must do my duty.

460
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:20,900
You are sometimes...

461
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:22,400
...Lonely?

462
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:26,199
Sometimes.

463
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:45,699
What did you say your name is?

464
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,099
Lieutenant Fakenham.

465
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:52,099
No, I mean...

466
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,400
...what is the name before Fakenham?

467
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,300
My first name?

468
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,199
Jonathan.

469
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:07,099
Would you like...

470
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:08,699
...to stay with me?

471
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,500
For a few days, or sometimes?

472
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:17,800
That would be very nice.

473
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,599
Goodbye, my beautiful Lischen.

474
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:58,500
Goodbye, Redmond.

475
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,699
I love you.

476
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,000
I love you.

477
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,300
Look after yourself.

478
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:13,099
God be with you.

479
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,599
A lady who sets her heart
on a lad in uniform...

480
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,300
...must be prepared to change lovers
pretty quickly...

481
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,599
...or her life will be a sad one.

482
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,199
This heart of Lischen's was like
many a neighboring town...

483
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:38,900
...that had been stormed and occupied
many times before Barry came to invest it.

484
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,699
During five years of war...

485
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,900
...the illustrious Frederick had
so exhausted the males of his kingdom...

486
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:13,500
...that he had to employ recruiters...

487
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,199
...who would commit any crime,
including kidnapping...

488
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:22,099
...to keep supplied those brilliant
regiments of his with cannon fodder.

489
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,099
Good evening, sir.

490
00:56:55,699 --> 00:56:59,900
I'm Captain Potzdorf.
To whom have I the honour of speaking?

491
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,699
Good evening. I'm Lieutenant Fakenham,
Gale's Regiment of Foot.

492
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,400
Pleased to meet you.

493
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,000
Can we be of assistance to you?

494
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,099
Thank you, but I am carrying urgent
despatches and must continue on my way.

495
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,400
And your destination?

496
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,599
Bremen.

497
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:25,900
Then you're obviously lost, Lieutenant.

498
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,000
Bremen is in the opposite direction.

499
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,099
Are you sure?

500
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:30,000
Yes.

501
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,400
Wouldn't you know it!

502
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,400
My departure was so hasty that
my orderly forgot to prepare proper maps.

503
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,300
I understand.

504
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,800
Please, do not be offended, Lieutenant...

505
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,900
...but are you carrying
your identity papers?

506
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,199
Yes, of course.

507
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,199
May I see them?

508
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:00,300
Of course.

509
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,000
Thank you.

510
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,400
Thank you, Lieutenant,
I hope I haven't inconvenienced you.

511
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,000
Not at all.

512
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,099
Now that we are riding
in the same direction...

513
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:36,199
...may I offer you a meal and a bed
for the night...

514
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:38,699
...and a proper map for the journey?

515
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:45,599
That's kind of you, Captain.
I'd be honoured to accept.

516
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,099
Barry was treated with great civility...

517
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,400
...and was asked questions
about England.

518
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:18,300
He answered as best he could,
inventing many stories.

519
00:59:19,699 --> 00:59:22,000
He described the King and Ministers...

520
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,900
...boasted that the British Ambassador
in Berlin was his uncle...

521
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:29,099
...and even offered Potzdorf
a letter of introduction.

522
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:33,500
His host seemed satisfied
with these stories.

523
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:40,000
But, he led Barry on with
a skillful combination of questions...

524
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,199
...and flattery.

525
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:44,400
I know so little of your country
of England...

526
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,099
...except that you are
the bravest nation in the world...

527
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,099
...and that we are fortunate
to have such allies.

528
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,400
Lieutenant Fakenham...

529
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:58,900
...let us drink to the friendship
of our two great nations.

530
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,300
To our two great nations.

531
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,500
Aren't you lucky,
going to Bremen tomorrow?

532
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:29,500
I know one of the loveliest women
in Europe there.

533
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,599
Would you take a letter to her?

534
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,300
Certainly.

535
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:40,000
By the way, to whom are you carrying
your despatches?

536
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,500
General Williamson.

537
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,300
General Williamson?

538
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:53,699
General Percival Williamson?

539
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,699
Yes, the same.

540
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,800
This man is under arrest.

541
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,400
Under arrest? Captain Potzdorf, sir...

542
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,699
...I'm a British Officer.

543
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,000
You're a liar and an imposter.

544
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,400
You're a deserter.

545
01:01:27,699 --> 01:01:31,699
I suspected you this morning.
Your lies and folly have confirmed this.

546
01:01:32,699 --> 01:01:36,800
You pretend to carry despatches
to a General, dead these ten months.

547
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,400
You say the British Ambassador in Berlin...

548
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:43,300
...is your uncle,
with the ridiculous name of O'Grady.

549
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:48,000
Now, will you join and take the bounty,
or be given up?

550
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,800
I volunteer.

551
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,400
The Prussian Service was worse
than the English.

552
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:06,099
The life of a Private Soldier
was frightful.

553
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:12,500
Punishment was incessant.
Every Officer had the right to inflict it.

554
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:18,099
The gauntlet was a common penalty
for minor offences.

555
01:02:19,099 --> 01:02:23,699
More serious ones were punishable
by mutilation or death.

556
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,500
At the close of the Seven Years' War
the army...

557
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:41,199
...renowned for its disciplined valour,
was officered by native Prussians.

558
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,500
But it was mostly composed...

559
01:02:44,199 --> 01:02:46,900
...of men from the lowest levels
of humanity...

560
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,000
...hired or stolen
from every nation in Europe.

561
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,800
Thus, Barry fell
into the worst company...

562
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:02,400
...and was soon far advanced in
the science of every kind of misconduct.

563
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,400
Help.

564
01:04:57,099 --> 01:04:59,099
Get me out of here.

565
01:06:13,099 --> 01:06:18,000
The Colonel's speech declared
the King's satisfaction...

566
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,300
...with the conduct of the Regiment
at the Battle of Audorf...

567
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:26,400
...and with Corporal Barry's bravery
in rescuing Captain Potzdorf...

568
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,900
...which was to be rewarded
with the sum of two frederick d'or.

569
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:39,400
Corporal Barry, eight paces forward...

570
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,099
...march!

571
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,199
Corporal Barry.

572
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,000
You're a gallant soldier,
and evidently of good stock...

573
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,800
...but you're idle and unprincipled.

574
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,500
You're a bad influence on the men.

575
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And for all your bravery,
I'm sure you'll come to no good.

576
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,699
I hope the Colonel is mistaken.

577
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,800
I have fallen into bad company,
but I've only done as other soldiers do.

578
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:26,500
I've never had a friend
or protector before...

579
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,000
...to show that I was worthy
of better things.

580
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,000
The Colonel may say I'm ruined,
and send me to the Devil.

581
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,699
But, I would go to the Devil
to serve the Regiment.

582
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,000
Corporal Barry, fall in.

583
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:57,500
The war ended and Barry's regiment
was garrisoned in the Capital.

584
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:04,900
He had, for some time, ingratiated himself
with Captain Potzdorf...

585
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,699
...whose confidence in him
was about to bring its reward.

586
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,100
Good morning, Redmond.

587
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:20,800
Good morning, Captain.

588
01:08:21,699 --> 01:08:26,199
I should like you to meet my uncle,
the Minister of Police.

589
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,800
Good morning, Herr Minister.

590
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:31,899
Redmond...

591
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:36,300
...I've spoken to the Minister regarding
your services and your fortune is made.

592
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,899
We shall get you out of the Army...

593
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:42,800
...appoint you to the Police Bureau,
and, in time...

594
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:47,600
...we'll allow you to move
in a better sphere.

595
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,199
Thank you, Captain.

596
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:58,500
Your loyalty to me and service
to the Regiment has pleased me.

597
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:03,500
Now there is another occasion
on which you can assist us.

598
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,199
If you succeed...

599
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,600
...your reward will be secure.

600
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,699
I'll do my best, sir.

601
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:27,300
There is a gentleman in Berlin
in the service of the Empress of Austria.

602
01:09:27,699 --> 01:09:31,000
He calls himself
the Chevalier de Balibari.

603
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:34,399
He appears to be a professional gambler.

604
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,199
He's a libertine:

605
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:40,100
Fond of women, of good food...

606
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:42,800
...polished, obliging.

607
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:47,399
He speaks French and German indifferently.

608
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:52,000
But we have reason to fancy
that Monsieur de Balibari...

609
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,399
...is a native of your country of Ireland.

610
01:09:57,399 --> 01:10:00,500
And that he has come here as a spy.

611
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Your knowledge of English...

612
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:16,699
...makes you an ideal choice
to go into his service...

613
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:20,100
...and find out whether or not
he is a spy.

614
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,399
Does this assignment interest you?

615
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:31,500
Minister, I'm interested in anything
that can be of service to you...

616
01:10:31,399 --> 01:10:33,100
...and Captain Potzdorf.

617
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:46,699
You will not know a word of English.

618
01:10:47,899 --> 01:10:53,100
If the Chevalier remarks on your accent,
say you are Hungarian.

619
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,300
You served in the war.

620
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,800
You left the Army for medical reasons...

621
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:03,500
...then served Monsieur de Quellenberg
for two years.

622
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
He's now with the Army in Silesia,
but you'll have a certificate from him.

623
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,500
Good morning, Your Honour.

624
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,600
So you are the young man
recommended by Seebach.

625
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:59,899
Yes, Your Honour,
here are my credentials.

626
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,399
Your name is Lazlo Zilagy?

627
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,600
Yes, Your Honour.

628
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:22,399
Monsieur de Quellenberg
recommends you highly.

629
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:26,899
Monsieur is a very good man.

630
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,300
It was imprudent of him...

631
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:39,899
...but when Barry saw
the Chevalier's splendour...

632
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,199
...and noble manner...

633
01:12:42,899 --> 01:12:45,699
...he felt unable to keep disguise
with him.

634
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:49,500
Those who have never been exiled...

635
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,600
...know not what it is to hear
a friendly voice in captivity...

636
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:58,100
...and would not understand the cause...

637
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,500
...of the burst of feeling
now about to take place.

638
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,699
You seem the right one to me.

639
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,800
Thank you, Your Honour.

640
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:19,600
Are you ill?

641
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:26,300
Sir...

642
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,699
...I have a confession to make to you.

643
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,500
I'm an Irishman.

644
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,600
My name is Redmond Barry.

645
01:13:38,899 --> 01:13:41,899
I was abducted into the Prussian Army.

646
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,199
Now I've been put into your service...

647
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:50,500
...by my Captain Potzdorf
and his uncle, the Minister of Police...

648
01:13:53,899 --> 01:13:57,500
...to serve as a watch
upon your... actions...

649
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,500
...and to give information to them.

650
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:28,800
The Chevalier was much affected
at thus finding one of his countrymen.

651
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,600
For he too was an exile.

652
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:35,000
And a friendly voice, a look...

653
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:38,699
...brought the old country
back to his memory.

654
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:45,500
He is very religious
and attends church regularly.

655
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,600
After Mass he comes home for breakfast.

656
01:14:52,699 --> 01:14:55,100
He then takes an airing in his carriage.

657
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:58,500
Barry presented his reports
regularly to the Minister.

658
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,899
The details were arranged
beforehand with the Chevalier.

659
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:07,300
He was instructed to tell the truth...

660
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,600
...as much as his story
would possibly bear.

661
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:16,300
The information he gave
was very minute and accurate...

662
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,699
...though not very important.

663
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,699
Wine or punch, Your Honour?

664
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:42,399
Wine.

665
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:47,600
It was agreed that Barry should keep
his character of valet.

666
01:15:48,199 --> 01:15:52,000
That, before strangers,
he should not know a word of English.

667
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:58,100
And that he should keep a lookout
on the trumps when serving the wine.

668
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:01,500
Having excellent eyesight...

669
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,600
...and a natural aptitude...

670
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:08,199
...he was able to give his dear patron
much assistance...

671
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:11,000
...against his opponents
at the green table.

672
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,800
Lf, for instance, he wiped
the table with a napkin...

673
01:16:15,899 --> 01:16:18,699
...the enemy was strong in Diamonds.

674
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:22,300
If he adjusted a chair it meant Ace King.

675
01:16:22,699 --> 01:16:25,600
If he said, '"Punch or wine, My Lord? '"...

676
01:16:25,399 --> 01:16:28,100
...Hearts were meant, and so forth.

677
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,699
The Prince of Tubingen...

678
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,300
...who had intimate connections
with the Great Frederick...

679
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:50,800
...was passionately fond of play
as were the gentlemen...

680
01:16:50,699 --> 01:16:52,800
...of almost all the Courts of Europe.

681
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,100
You owe 15,500 frederick d'or.

682
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,100
Chevalier...

683
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,899
...though I cannot say how...

684
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:39,600
...I believe you have cheated me.

685
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,300
I deny Your Grace's accusation...

686
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,800
...and beg you to say
how you have been cheated.

687
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,399
I don't know.

688
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:58,899
But I believe I have been.

689
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,300
Your Grace owes me
15,500 frederick d'or...

690
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,100
...which I have honourably won.

691
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:11,300
Chevalier...

692
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:17,399
...if you will have your money now
you must fight for it.

693
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,000
If you will be patient...

694
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,800
...maybe I will pay you something
another time.

695
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:33,399
Your Grace, if I am to be so tame
as to take this...

696
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,100
...then I must give up an honourable
and lucrative occupation.

697
01:18:38,899 --> 01:18:41,000
I have said all there is to be said.

698
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:46,000
I am at your disposal
for whatever purposes you wish.

699
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:48,800
Good night.

700
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:11,899
Was the Prince cheated?

701
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:17,899
In as far as I am able to tell,
Herr Minister, no.

702
01:19:18,199 --> 01:19:20,399
I believe he won the money fairly.

703
01:19:24,699 --> 01:19:26,899
What are the Chevalier's intentions?

704
01:19:27,899 --> 01:19:29,100
I'm not sure.

705
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:34,100
The Prince told him that if he wanted
his money he'd have to fight for it.

706
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,899
A meeting with the Prince is impossible.

707
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,199
The Prince has left him no other choice.

708
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:16,399
Will you be able to return here tomorrow
without arousing suspicion?

709
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,899
I know they won't allow a meeting
with the Prince.

710
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,399
But if I say that, do you know any reason
why he'll pay me what he owes?

711
01:20:26,699 --> 01:20:29,899
You must tell them I intend
to demand satisfaction.

712
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,899
Don't look so downcast, my boy.

713
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:37,399
They cannot harm me,
the Austrian Embassy will see to that.

714
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,100
The worst they can do is send me
out of this dreary country of theirs.

715
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:46,199
If they should, don't worry...

716
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,899
...you shall not be left behind.

717
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,000
Have no fear of that.

718
01:20:52,899 --> 01:20:56,699
The King has determined to send
the Chevalier out of the country.

719
01:20:57,699 --> 01:21:00,300
Has he already demanded satisfaction?

720
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:05,000
Not yet, but I believe he intends to...

721
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,399
...possibly today.

722
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:10,300
Then this must be done tomorrow.

723
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,600
All the arrangements are made.

724
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:21,399
You said he takes a drive
after breakfast every day.

725
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,500
Yes, sir.

726
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:27,899
Is there any reason he should do
any different tomorrow?

727
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
No, sir.

728
01:21:30,699 --> 01:21:31,699
Good.

729
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,699
When the Chevalier comes out
to his carriage in the morning...

730
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,899
...two Officers will meet him
and escort him to the frontier.

731
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,699
His baggage will be sent after him.

732
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,100
Excellent.

733
01:21:55,899 --> 01:21:58,199
At ten o'clock the next morning...

734
01:21:58,699 --> 01:22:00,899
...the Chevalier de Balibari...

735
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:04,100
...went out for his regular morning drive.

736
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,800
Where's my servant, Lazlo?

737
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,699
I will let down the steps, Your Honour.

738
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,199
What is this about?

739
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,699
Please get inside.

740
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:34,699
Am I under arrest?

741
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,100
We're driving to the frontier.

742
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:42,000
Frontier? But I'm on my way
to the Austrian Ambassador's house.

743
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,899
My orders are to escort you
to the frontier...

744
01:22:44,899 --> 01:22:47,300
...and see you safely across the border.

745
01:22:47,699 --> 01:22:49,600
But, I'm not going to the frontier.

746
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,600
I have very important business
at the Austrian Ambassador's house.

747
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,300
My orders are to take Your Honour
to the frontier by any means necessary.

748
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,000
If you come willingly...

749
01:22:59,899 --> 01:23:03,100
...I'm to give you this purse
on behalf of the Prince of Tubingen...

750
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,600
...containing 2,000 frederick d'or.

751
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,699
All Europe shall hear of this.

752
01:23:22,699 --> 01:23:26,800
And so, without papers or passport...

753
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:30,000
...and under the eyes
of two Prussian Officers...

754
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:35,199
...Barry was escorted across the frontier
into Saxony and freedom.

755
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:41,000
The Chevalier himself had uneventfully
crossed the frontier the night before.

756
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,199
By these wonderful circumstances,
Barry was once more free...

757
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:01,100
...and began his professional work
as a gamester...

758
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:06,899
...resolving, thenceforward and forever,
to live the life of a gentleman.

759
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:09,800
The four wins.

760
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,100
Soon he and the Chevalier were received
in all the Courts of Europe...

761
01:24:15,899 --> 01:24:17,199
...and were speedily...

762
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:21,000
...in the very best society
where play was patronized...

763
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:24,399
...and professors of that science
always welcome.

764
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,800
The seven.

765
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:30,899
Why not the seven?

766
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,899
All... all, yes.

767
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,100
No more bets.

768
01:24:45,899 --> 01:24:47,000
Number seven...

769
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,100
...loses.

770
01:24:56,399 --> 01:24:57,899
Place your bets.

771
01:25:00,899 --> 01:25:04,899
Chevalier, will you give me credit
for 5,000 louis d'or, please?

772
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,100
Of course, Lord Ludd.

773
01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:19,899
Five thousand.

774
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:24,000
Now, everything on the four.

775
01:25:27,399 --> 01:25:30,000
Yes, I know, everything on the four.

776
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,399
No more bets.

777
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,600
The four loses.

778
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,500
It is not important.

779
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,399
Now, I'm weary.

780
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:13,399
I would like dinner. Shall we?

781
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,600
Excuse me, Lord Ludd.

782
01:26:18,899 --> 01:26:20,300
If you don't mind.

783
01:26:21,399 --> 01:26:22,500
Not at all.

784
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:30,300
They always played on credit with
any person of honour or noble lineage.

785
01:26:30,699 --> 01:26:32,899
They never pressed for their winnings...

786
01:26:32,899 --> 01:26:35,800
...or declined to receive
promissory notes.

787
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:40,500
But woe to the man who did not pay
when the note became due.

788
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:44,199
Barry was sure to wait upon him
with his bill.

789
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,399
There were few bad debts.

790
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,399
Salute.

791
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:51,899
It was Barry's skill with the sword,
and readiness to use it...

792
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,300
...that maintained the reputation
of the firm, so to speak.

793
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:56,399
On guard!

794
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:46,600
I will pay you today, sir.

795
01:27:48,199 --> 01:27:51,000
Thus, it will be seen, their life...

796
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,100
...for all its splendour,
was not without danger and difficulty...

797
01:27:55,399 --> 01:27:58,199
...requiring talent and determination
for success.

798
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:02,899
And required them to live
a wandering and disconnected life.

799
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:08,699
And, though they were swimming
upon the high tide of fortune...

800
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:13,000
...and prospering with the cards,
they had little to show for their labour...

801
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,399
...but some fine clothes
and a few trinkets.

802
01:28:27,899 --> 01:28:33,000
Five years in the Army,
and considerable experience of the world...

803
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:37,699
...had dispelled any romantic notions
regarding love...

804
01:28:38,199 --> 01:28:40,399
...with which Barry commenced life.

805
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:45,000
And he had it in mind,
as many gentlemen had done before him...

806
01:28:45,399 --> 01:28:48,600
...to marry a woman
of fortune and condition.

807
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,000
And, as such things so often happen...

808
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:56,699
...these thoughts coincided
with his setting sight upon a lady...

809
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,899
...who will play a considerable part
in the drama of his life.

810
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
The Countess of Lyndon...

811
01:29:04,699 --> 01:29:07,100
...Viscountess Bullingdon of England...

812
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:09,500
...Baroness Castle Lyndon of Ireland.

813
01:29:10,699 --> 01:29:13,800
A woman of vast wealth and great beauty.

814
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,600
She was the wife of Sir Charles Lyndon...

815
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,199
...Knight of the Bath...

816
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:25,399
...Minister to George III
at several of the Courts of Europe.

817
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,600
A cripple, wheeled about in a chair...

818
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:32,600
...worn out by gout
and a myriad of diseases.

819
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,500
Her Ladyship's Chaplain, Mr. Runt...

820
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:41,100
...acted as tutor to her son,
the little Viscount Bullingdon...

821
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,000
...a melancholy little boy,
much attached to his mother.

822
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,600
I'm going outside for a breath of air.

823
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:02,399
Yes, My Lady.

824
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,100
To make a long story short...

825
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:01,100
...six hours after they met...
Her Ladyship was in love.

826
01:34:01,699 --> 01:34:03,800
And once Barry got into her company...

827
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:08,100
...he found innumerable occasions
to improve his intimacy...

828
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,899
...and was scarcely out
of Her Ladyship's sight.

829
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,800
Good evening, gentlemen.

830
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,699
Sir Charles.

831
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:13,100
Good evening, Mr. Barry.

832
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,800
Have you done with my Lady?

833
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:19,300
Pardon?

834
01:35:20,199 --> 01:35:24,899
Come, sir. I'm a man who would rather
be known as a cuckold than a fool.

835
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,100
I think, Sir Charles,
that you've had too much to drink.

836
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:32,800
What?

837
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:38,500
As it happens, your Chaplain, Mr. Runt,
introduced me to your Lady...

838
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,800
...to advise me on a religious matter,
of which she is an expert.

839
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:53,199
He wants... to step into my shoes.

840
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:57,100
He wants to step into my shoes.

841
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,800
Is it not a pleasure for me,
as I am drawing near the goal...

842
01:36:02,699 --> 01:36:05,300
...to find my home such a happy one...

843
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:09,399
...my wife so fond of me, that she is even
now thinking of appointing a successor?

844
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:12,300
Isn't it a comfort to see her
like a prudent housewife...

845
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:15,399
...getting everything ready
for my departure?

846
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:20,300
I hope you're not thinking of leaving us,
Sir Charles?

847
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:25,800
Not so soon as you may fancy, perhaps.

848
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:29,600
I've been given over many times
these four years.

849
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:32,699
And there was always
a candidate or two...

850
01:36:32,699 --> 01:36:35,500
...waiting to apply for the situation.

851
01:36:35,699 --> 01:36:37,399
I'm sorry for you, Mr. Barry.

852
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:40,300
It grieves me to keep you
or any gentleman waiting.

853
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,399
Had you not better arrange
with my doctor...

854
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:46,399
...or have the cook flavour my omelette
with arsenic, eh?

855
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:51,800
What are the odds, gentlemen,
that I live to see Mr. Barry hang yet?

856
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,699
Sir, let those laugh that win.

857
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:02,399
Gentlemen.

858
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:24,699
I'll get a surgeon.

859
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:30,899
Have some brandy, Sir Charles.

860
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:34,399
From a report in
The Saint James' Chronicle:

861
01:37:35,699 --> 01:37:38,699
'"Died at Spa in Belgium...

862
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:42,699

01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:57,100
'"He has left behind him a name
which is endeared to all his friends. '

867
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:39,699
"Dearly beloved...

868
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,300
"...we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...

869
01:38:44,899 --> 01:38:47,600
"...and in the face of this congregation...

870
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:52,399
"...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony."

871
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:55,500
A year later,
on the fifteenth of June...

872
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:58,800
...in the year 1773...

873
01:38:58,899 --> 01:39:04,199
...Redmond Barry had the honour to lead
to the altar the Countess of Lyndon.

874
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:10,600
The ceremony was performed by the
Reverend Runt, Her Ladyship's Chaplain.

875
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,899
"And therefore is not in any way
to be enterprised...

876
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:18,300
"...nor taken in hand unadvisedly...

877
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,000
"...lightly or wantonly...

878
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:26,300
"...to satisfy men's carnal lusts
and appetites...

879
01:39:26,199 --> 01:39:29,300
"...like brute beasts
that have no understanding.

880
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:33,899
"But reverently...

881
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,300
"...discreetly...

882
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:38,500
"...advisedly...

883
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:40,699
"...soberly...

884
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,100
"...and in the fear of God.

885
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,000
"Duly considering the causes
for which matrimony was ordained.

886
01:39:51,699 --> 01:39:52,699
"First...

887
01:39:53,399 --> 01:39:56,399
"...it was ordained for the procreation
of children to be brought up...

888
01:39:56,300 --> 01:40:01,300
"...in the fear and nurture of the Lord,
and to the praise of His holy name.

889
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:03,800
"Secondly...

890
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:09,899
"...it was ordained for a remedy
against sin, and to avoid fornication."

891
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:15,500
Barry had now arrived
at the pitch of prosperity...

892
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:21,800
...and by his own energy had raised
himself to a higher sphere of society...

893
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:27,699
...having procured His Majesty's
gracious permission to add the name...

894
01:40:27,699 --> 01:40:30,100
...of his lovely Lady to his own.

895
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:35,100
Thenceforth, Redmond Barry
assumed the style...

896
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,399
...and title of Barry Lyndon.

897
01:41:08,199 --> 01:41:11,800
Redmond, would you mind not smoking
for a while?

898
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:31,800
Lady Lyndon was soon destined
to occupy a place in Barry's life...

899
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:37,300
...not very much more important
than the elegant carpets and pictures...

900
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:40,600
...which would form
the pleasant background of his existence.

901
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:53,399
My Lord Bullingdon,
you seem particularly glum today?

902
01:41:57,899 --> 01:42:01,100
You should be happy
that your mother has remarried.

903
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:06,399
Not in this way.

904
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:10,800
And not in such haste.

905
01:42:12,899 --> 01:42:14,899
And certainly not to this man.

906
01:42:18,199 --> 01:42:20,699
I think you judge your mother too harshly.

907
01:42:22,199 --> 01:42:25,000
Do you not like your new father?

908
01:42:26,899 --> 01:42:28,100
Not very much.

909
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:32,600
He seems to me little more
than a common opportunist.

910
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,100
I don't think he loves my mother at all.

911
01:42:36,899 --> 01:42:40,600
And it hurts me to see her
make such a fool of herself.

912
01:43:00,199 --> 01:43:04,800
At the end of a year Her Ladyship
presented Barry with a son.

913
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,500
Bryan Patrick Lyndon, they called him.

914
01:43:31,399 --> 01:43:35,800
Her Ladyship and Barry lived,
after a while, pretty separate.

915
01:43:37,399 --> 01:43:42,100
She preferred quiet, or to say the truth,
he preferred it for her...

916
01:43:42,699 --> 01:43:46,699
...being a great friend to a modest
and tranquil behaviour in woman.

917
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:52,199
Besides, she was a mother,
and would have great comfort...

918
01:43:52,199 --> 01:43:56,100
...in the dressing, educating
and dandling of their little Bryan.

919
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
For whose sake it was fit,
Barry believed...

920
01:44:00,199 --> 01:44:04,100
...that she should give up the pleasures
and frivolities of the world...

921
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:07,500
...leaving that part of the duty
of every family of distinction...

922
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:09,800
...to be performed by him.

923
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:28,300
Lady Lyndon tended to a melancholy
and maudlin temper...

924
01:45:29,399 --> 01:45:33,399
...and, left alone by her husband,
was rarely happy or in good humour.

925
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:37,899
Now she must add jealousy
to her other complaints...

926
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:41,800
...and find rivals even among her maids.

927
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:12,600
Samuel, what would the time be?

928
01:46:15,699 --> 01:46:18,199
Twenty-five minutes past eleven,
My Lady.

929
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:34,000
Shall we make this the last game, ladies?

930
01:47:20,899 --> 01:47:22,500
Good morning, ladies.

931
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,600
Would you mind excusing us?
I'd like a word alone with Lady Lyndon.

932
01:47:54,399 --> 01:47:55,500
I'm sorry.

933
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:40,100
This coat is made of the finest velvet...

934
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,399
...all cunningly worked
with silver thread.

935
01:48:43,699 --> 01:48:47,800
No finer velvet has ever been woven,
and you will see none better anywhere.

936
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,199
Pardon me, gentlemen.

937
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:55,300
Good morning, dearest.

938
01:48:56,500 --> 01:49:00,399
We're taking the children for a ride
to the village. We'll be back for tea.

939
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:02,600
Have a nice time. I'll see you then.

940
01:49:02,699 --> 01:49:04,500
Goodbye, little Bryan.

941
01:49:08,699 --> 01:49:10,199
Lord Bullingdon.

942
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:14,399
Take good care of your mother.

943
01:49:19,899 --> 01:49:22,500
Come now, give your father a proper kiss.

944
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,899
Lord Bullingdon...

945
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,600
...is that the way to behave
to your father?

946
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:43,699
Lord Bullingdon,
have you lost your tongue?

947
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:51,500
My father was Sir Charles Lyndon.
I have not forgotten him, if others have.

948
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:55,199
Lord Bullingdon,
you have insulted your father!

949
01:49:56,699 --> 01:49:59,199
Madam, you have insulted my father.

950
01:50:03,699 --> 01:50:08,000
Dearest, would you excuse us?
We have something to discuss in private.

951
01:50:08,199 --> 01:50:09,500
Gentlemen.

952
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:22,600
One.

953
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:26,800
Two.

954
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:43,500
Six.

955
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:53,800
Lord Bullingdon...

956
01:50:54,899 --> 01:50:58,399
...I have always been willing
to live with you on friendly terms.

957
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,800
But be clear about one thing:

958
01:51:01,899 --> 01:51:04,000
As men serve me, I serve them.

959
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:08,199
I never laid a cane on the back
of a Lord before...

960
01:51:08,199 --> 01:51:12,199
...but, if you force me to, I shall
speedily become used to the practice.

961
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,899
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

962
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:19,899
No.

963
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,699
You may go.

964
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:30,000
Barry believed, and not without
some reason, that it had been...

965
01:51:29,899 --> 01:51:33,899
...a declaration of war against him
by Bullingdon from the start...

966
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:37,199
...and that the evil consequences
that ensued...

967
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:39,600
...were entirely of Bullingdon's creating.

968
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:45,300
I shall make you into
a real magician now, Bryan.

969
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:48,399
I shall show you the knot that never was.

970
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:51,600
As Bullingdon grew up to be a man...

971
01:51:52,699 --> 01:51:55,699
...his hatred for Barry
assumed an intensity...

972
01:51:56,199 --> 01:51:59,500
...equaled only by his
increased devotion to his mother.

973
01:51:59,699 --> 01:52:01,800
Very good, Bryan. A little bow.

974
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,899
Put it on the table for me.
Thank you.

975
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:13,000
For Bryan's eighth birthday the local
nobility, gentry and their children...

976
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,300
...came to pay their respects.

977
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:18,500
The inside and outside are quite empty.

978
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:21,500
Wave your hand over the top.
Is there anything there?

979
01:52:23,399 --> 01:52:26,600
Wonderful! Wonderful, colourful
silk handkerchiefs!

980
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:29,300
Take a bow, Bryan,
you did that beautifully.

981
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:30,500
Very good.

982
01:52:30,899 --> 01:52:33,500
Let's see if you have something
behind your ear.

983
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:34,600
Yes, you have.

984
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:37,000
A little ball. Let's make it vanish.

985
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:38,000
It's gone.

986
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,600
Here it is, behind my elbow.

987
01:52:42,699 --> 01:52:45,399
Wave your hand
over my green silk handkerchief...

988
01:52:45,399 --> 01:52:49,300
...and see if we can produce
a magic flower. I wonder if we can?

989
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:51,399
Here it comes.

990
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,500
The colours of the rainbow.

991
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:59,100
You know all the colours of the rainbow
produce but one colour, Bryan.

992
01:52:59,399 --> 01:53:01,000
Nothing in my magic cabinet.

993
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:03,000
They produce the colour... white.

994
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:05,199
And there is my own...

995
01:53:05,699 --> 01:53:08,699
...beautiful white rabbit.

996
01:53:10,199 --> 01:53:13,100
Bryan, you have done very well.
A little bow.

997
01:53:36,199 --> 01:53:39,800
We crept up on their fort,
and I jumped over the wall first.

998
01:53:39,899 --> 01:53:41,699
My fellows jumped after me.

999
01:53:42,199 --> 01:53:47,000
You should have seen the Frenchmen's
faces when 23 rampaging he-devils...

1000
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:51,800
...sword and pistol, cut and thrust,
came tumbling into their fort.

1001
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,100
In three minutes we left
as many Artillery men's heads...

1002
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:57,899
...as there were cannon balls.

1003
01:53:59,399 --> 01:54:03,199
Later we were visited
by our noble Prince Henry.

1004
01:54:03,399 --> 01:54:06,800
"Who is the man who has done this?"
I stepped forward.

1005
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:10,399
"How many heads was it
that you cut off?" He says.

1006
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:13,199
"Nineteen," says I,
"besides wounding several."

1007
01:54:14,199 --> 01:54:18,199
Well, I'll be blessed,
if he didn't burst into tears.

1008
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:20,600
"Noble, noble fellow," he said.

1009
01:54:20,699 --> 01:54:25,000
"Here is nineteen golden guineas,
one for each head that you cut off."

1010
01:54:25,699 --> 01:54:27,300
What do you think of that?

1011
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:29,600
Were you allowed to keep the heads?

1012
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:33,100
No, they always become
the property of the King.

1013
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,600
Will you tell me another story?

1014
01:54:35,899 --> 01:54:37,699
I'll tell you one tomorrow.

1015
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:40,100
Will you play cards with me tomorrow?

1016
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:42,800
Of course I will. Now go to sleep.

1017
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,800
Will you keep the candles lit?

1018
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,199
Bryan, big boys don't sleep
with the candles lit.

1019
01:54:52,899 --> 01:54:54,600
I'm afraid of the dark.

1020
01:54:54,899 --> 01:54:57,500
My darling, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

1021
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:01,000
But, I like it with the candles lit.

1022
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
All right, you can sleep
with the candles lit.

1023
01:55:04,899 --> 01:55:06,300
Thank you, Papa.

1024
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:07,699
Good night.

1025
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:30,399
Ah, Redmond!

1026
01:55:31,399 --> 01:55:36,800
It's a blessing to see my darling boy
has attained a position I knew was his due.

1027
01:55:38,699 --> 01:55:41,699
And for which I pinched myself
to educate him.

1028
01:55:43,399 --> 01:55:45,399
Little Bryan is a darling boy...

1029
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:48,300
...and you live in great splendour.

1030
01:55:48,899 --> 01:55:51,199
Your lady wife knows
she has a treasure...

1031
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:53,899
...she couldn't have had,
had she married a Duke.

1032
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:59,800
But, if she should tire
of my wild Redmond...

1033
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:02,699
...and his old-fashioned Irish ways...

1034
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:06,000
...or if she should die...

1035
01:56:06,899 --> 01:56:10,300
...what future would there be
for my son, and my grandson?

1036
01:56:11,899 --> 01:56:14,100
You have not a penny of your own...

1037
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:18,800
...and cannot transact any business
without her signature.

1038
01:56:20,199 --> 01:56:25,000
Upon her death the entire estate
would go to young Bullingdon...

1039
01:56:26,399 --> 01:56:28,699
...who bears you little affection.

1040
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:32,199
You could be penniless tomorrow...

1041
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:36,399
...and darling Bryan at the mercy
of his stepbrother.

1042
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:42,300
Shall I tell you something?

1043
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:48,300
There is only one way for you
and your son to have real security.

1044
01:56:48,899 --> 01:56:51,699
You must obtain a title.

1045
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I shall not rest
until I see you Lord Lyndon.

1046
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:01,699
You have important friends.

1047
01:57:01,699 --> 01:57:04,199
They can tell you
how these things are done.

1048
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,000
For money, well-timed
and properly applied...

1049
01:57:09,399 --> 01:57:11,500
...can accomplish anything.

1050
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:19,300
And Barry was acquainted with someone
who knew how these things were done.

1051
01:57:19,899 --> 01:57:24,800
This was the distinguished Barrister
and former Government Minister...

1052
01:57:24,699 --> 01:57:26,100
...Lord Hallam...

1053
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:31,500
...whose acquaintance he had made,
like so many others, at the gaming table.

1054
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:36,199
Do you happen to know
the Thirteenth Earl of Wendover?

1055
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:38,800
I don't believe I do.

1056
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:43,399
Well, this nobleman is one
of the Gentlemen of His Majesty's Closet...

1057
01:57:43,899 --> 01:57:49,000
...with whom our revered Monarch
is on terms of considerable intimacy.

1058
01:57:49,899 --> 01:57:53,800
In my opinion, you would be wise
to fix upon him...

1059
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:59,300
...your chief reliance for the advancement
of your claim to the peerage.

1060
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,399
When I take up a person, Mr. Lyndon,
he, or she, is safe.

1061
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:08,199
There is no question about them anymore.

1062
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:14,000
My friends are the best people.
I don't mean they're the most virtuous...

1063
01:58:13,899 --> 01:58:17,199
...or, indeed, the least virtuous,
or the cleverest...

1064
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:20,300
...or the stupidest,
richest or best born.

1065
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:21,800
But, the best.

1066
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:25,500
In a word, people about whom
there is no question.

1067
01:58:27,199 --> 01:58:30,000
I cannot promise how long it will take.

1068
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:33,300
You can appreciate
it is not an easy matter.

1069
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:38,399
But, any gentleman with an estate,
and 30,000 a year...

1070
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:40,000
...should have a peerage.

1071
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:48,000
And there standing behind me
was a total stranger.

1072
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,300
I looked at him, and he said to me:

1073
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:55,600
"Excuse me, sir, could you tell me,
is Lord Wendover alive or dead?"

1074
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:00,100
I was so astonished,
I couldn't think of what to say.

1075
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,600
Then I became angry,
and said to him, "He's dead."

1076
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:08,899
The striving after this peerage was
one of Barry's most unlucky dealings.

1077
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:12,399
He made great sacrifices
to bring it about.

1078
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:16,800
He lavished money here,
and diamonds there.

1079
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:20,300
He bought lands
at ten times their value...

1080
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:25,000
...purchased pictures and articles
of virtue at ruinous prices.

1081
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,800
He gave entertainments
to those friends to his claim...

1082
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:33,899
...all, being about the Royal person,
were likely to advance it.

1083
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:40,500
And, I can tell you, bribes were
administered. And in high places, too.

1084
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:46,300
So near the person of His Majesty
that you would be astonished to know...

1085
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:50,300
...what great noblemen condescended
to receive his loans.

1086
01:59:53,399 --> 01:59:55,699
This is by Ludovico Cordi...

1087
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,699
...a disciple of Alessandro Allori.

1088
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:02,000
It's dated 1605...

1089
02:00:02,899 --> 02:00:05,300
...and shows,
"The Adoration of The Magi."

1090
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:09,000
It's beautiful.

1091
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Yes.

1092
02:00:11,399 --> 02:00:14,399
I love the use of the colour blue
by the artist.

1093
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:16,500
Yes, that is very beautiful.

1094
02:00:19,199 --> 02:00:21,100
What is the price of this one?

1095
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,100
Well, this is one of my best pictures.

1096
02:00:25,699 --> 02:00:31,000
But, if you really like it, I'm sure
we can come to some arrangement.

1097
02:00:43,199 --> 02:00:44,800
Lord Wendover, Your Majesty.

1098
02:00:44,899 --> 02:00:47,199
I'm glad to see you here today,
Lord Wendover.

1099
02:00:47,199 --> 02:00:49,199
What news of Lady Wendover?

1100
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:52,199
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Lady Wendover is much better.

1101
02:00:52,199 --> 02:00:57,100
Good! Present my compliments to her.
Say we miss her company here.

1102
02:00:58,199 --> 02:01:00,100
And what of those excellent boys
of yours?

1103
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:04,800
They're well. Charles has gone to sea
under Captain Geary on the Ramillies.

1104
02:01:04,899 --> 02:01:08,000
John has gone to Oxford to learn
how to preach and pray.

1105
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,100
Good, good!

1106
02:01:10,100 --> 02:01:13,199
Your Majesty, may I present
Mr. Barry Lyndon.

1107
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:16,500
Mr. Lyndon. We were very fond
of Sir Charles Lyndon.

1108
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:18,000
And how is Lady Lyndon?

1109
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
She's very well, Your Majesty.

1110
02:01:20,399 --> 02:01:25,600
Mr. Lyndon raised a company of troops
to fight in America against the rebels.

1111
02:01:25,699 --> 02:01:29,500
Good, Mr. Lyndon. Raise another company
and go with them, too.

1112
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:45,399
Barry was born clever enough
at gaining a fortune...

1113
02:01:45,899 --> 02:01:48,000
...but incapable of keeping one.

1114
02:01:49,399 --> 02:01:53,500
For the qualities and energies
which lead a man to achieve the first...

1115
02:01:53,699 --> 02:01:57,000
...are often the very cause of his ruin
in the latter case.

1116
02:01:58,699 --> 02:02:02,600
Now he was burdened with
the harassing cares and responsibilities...

1117
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:06,399
...which are the dismal adjuncts
of great rank and property.

1118
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:08,899
And his life now...

1119
02:02:09,399 --> 02:02:13,899
...seemed to consist mostly of drafts
of letters to lawyers and money-brokers...

1120
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:15,800
...and endless correspondence...

1121
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:18,000
...with decorators and cooks.

1122
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:45,800
Gentlemen, I'm going to leave you for
a few minutes. Carry on with your work.

1123
02:02:45,899 --> 02:02:47,000
Yes, sir.

1124
02:03:04,199 --> 02:03:05,199
Bully.

1125
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:09,800
What does...

1126
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,199
..."strenuous" mean?

1127
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,800
Bryan, I'm trying to work.

1128
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:23,000
But what does it mean?

1129
02:03:26,699 --> 02:03:29,300
It means "an effort requiring strength."

1130
02:03:35,699 --> 02:03:37,699
What does "quadrangle" mean?

1131
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:47,600
A quadrangle is a four-sided figure
like a square or a rectangle.

1132
02:03:48,399 --> 02:03:51,300
Now, please be quiet,
and let me get on with my work.

1133
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:07,600
Bryan, please be quiet!

1134
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:13,199
Have you seen my pencil?

1135
02:04:16,399 --> 02:04:17,699
No, I haven't.

1136
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:34,500
Bryan, please stop making so much noise.

1137
02:04:38,699 --> 02:04:39,800
That's my pencil.

1138
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
No, it isn't.

1139
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:43,000
It is. It's my pencil!

1140
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,300
I've had this all morning.

1141
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:45,800
It's my pencil!

1142
02:04:45,699 --> 02:04:47,500
Listen, will you be quiet!

1143
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:48,800
It's my pencil!

1144
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:52,100
I'll teach you a lesson.

1145
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:56,800
What the devil's going on in here?

1146
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:00,899
I told you never
to lay a hand on this child.

1147
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:03,899
One.

1148
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:08,100
Two.

1149
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,399
Six.

1150
02:05:30,100 --> 02:05:32,399
Will that be all, Mr. Redmond Barry?

1151
02:05:33,899 --> 02:05:35,600
Yes, that will be all.

1152
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:40,899
Well then, look you now.

1153
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:47,600
From this moment, I will submit
to no further chastisement from you.

1154
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:52,300
I will kill you, if you lay hands
on me ever again.

1155
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,699
Is that clear to you, sir?

1156
02:06:00,399 --> 02:06:01,699
Get out of here!

1157
02:07:57,399 --> 02:08:00,699
Don't you think he fits my shoes
very well, Your Ladyship?

1158
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:07,800
Dear child...

1159
02:08:08,899 --> 02:08:11,899
...what a pity it is I'm not dead,
for your sake.

1160
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:17,600
The Lyndons would then have
a worthy representative...

1161
02:08:17,699 --> 02:08:19,500
...and enjoy all the benefits...

1162
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:22,600
...of the illustrious blood
of the Barrys of Barryville.

1163
02:08:26,899 --> 02:08:28,300
Would they not...

1164
02:08:29,300 --> 02:08:30,800
...Mr. Redmond Barry?

1165
02:08:36,899 --> 02:08:39,199
From the way I love this child...

1166
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:42,199
...you ought to know how
I would've loved his elder brother...

1167
02:08:42,199 --> 02:08:45,000
...had he proved worthy
of any mother's affection.

1168
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:47,300
Madam!

1169
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:53,300
I have borne as long
as mortal could endure...

1170
02:08:53,199 --> 02:08:57,899
...the ill-treatment of the insolent Irish
upstart whom you've taken to your bed.

1171
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:04,300
It is not only his lowly birth and the
brutality of his manners which disgust me.

1172
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:08,199
But the shameful nature of his conduct
toward Your Ladyship...

1173
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:11,100
...his brutal and
ungentlemanlike behaviour...

1174
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:13,000
...his open infidelity...

1175
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:17,199
...his shameless robberies and swindling
of my property, and yours.

1176
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:22,800
And as I cannot personally chastise
this low-bred ruffian, and cannot bear...

1177
02:09:22,699 --> 02:09:24,800
...to witness his treatment of you...

1178
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:27,800
...and loathe his company
as if it were the plague...

1179
02:09:28,899 --> 02:09:31,899
...I have decided to leave my home
and never return.

1180
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:35,199
At least, during his detested life...

1181
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:37,100
...or during my own.

1182
02:11:09,699 --> 02:11:11,699
Will anyone be joining
Your Lordship?

1183
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:13,300
No, I shall be alone.

1184
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,500
The roast beef's very good, My Lord.

1185
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:47,800
Hello, Neville. How are you?

1186
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:49,899
Ah, Barry. Hello.

1187
02:11:50,100 --> 02:11:52,699
I see you're alone.
Why don't you join me?

1188
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:56,100
Oh, thank you, Barry,
you're very kind, but...

1189
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:58,600
...I'm expecting someone to join me.

1190
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:03,300
What a shame! Lady Lyndon and I
have missed your company lately.

1191
02:12:03,399 --> 02:12:05,899
Please give my respects to Lady Lyndon...

1192
02:12:05,899 --> 02:12:09,300
...and say I've been very busy of late
and not been able to go about much.

1193
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:10,399
I shall.

1194
02:12:10,699 --> 02:12:14,300
The eighth of next month we're
having some guests over for cards...

1195
02:12:14,199 --> 02:12:17,100
...we'd love to have you
and Lady Wendover join us.

1196
02:12:17,899 --> 02:12:22,399
I'll check my diary, but I think
I'm engaged on that evening.

1197
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:25,699
I hope you're not engaged.
We'd love to see you again.

1198
02:12:25,899 --> 02:12:28,300
I'll write and say if I'm free or not.

1199
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,600
I look forward to hearing from you.
It's nice to see you again.

1200
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:38,800
If he had murdered Lord Bullingdon...

1201
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:43,500
...Barry could scarcely have been received
with more coldness and resentment...

1202
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:46,199
...that now followed him
in town and country.

1203
02:12:47,399 --> 02:12:49,399
His friends fell away from him.

1204
02:12:49,699 --> 02:12:52,699
A legend arose of his cruelty
to his stepson.

1205
02:13:02,899 --> 02:13:05,899
Now all the bills came down
on him together.

1206
02:13:06,699 --> 02:13:10,500
All the bills he had been contracting
for the years of his marriage...

1207
02:13:10,399 --> 02:13:13,600
...and which the creditors sent in
with a hasty unanimity.

1208
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:15,899
Their amount was frightful.

1209
02:13:17,399 --> 02:13:21,600
Barry was now bound up in an
inextricable toil of bills and debts...

1210
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:26,899
...of mortgages and insurances,
and all the evils attendant upon them.

1211
02:13:28,199 --> 02:13:32,300
Lady Lyndon's income was hampered
almost irretrievably...

1212
02:13:32,399 --> 02:13:34,199
...to satisfy these claims.

1213
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:21,199
Do you think that's good?

1214
02:14:21,199 --> 02:14:22,399
Excellent.

1215
02:14:22,899 --> 02:14:24,199
Who's this?

1216
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:26,399
It's a peacock on the wall.

1217
02:14:28,199 --> 02:14:29,500
What's it say?

1218
02:14:29,699 --> 02:14:31,699
I saw this bird yesterday.

1219
02:14:36,699 --> 02:14:37,899
Who's that?

1220
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:40,199
Mama in her coach.

1221
02:14:41,300 --> 02:14:42,800
Is she going to London?

1222
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:44,800
I don't know.

1223
02:14:51,199 --> 02:14:53,000
Barry had his faults...

1224
02:14:53,899 --> 02:14:58,000
...but no man could say of him
that he was not a good and tender father.

1225
02:14:59,399 --> 02:15:02,000
He loved his son with a blind partiality.

1226
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,600
He denied him nothing.

1227
02:15:06,100 --> 02:15:09,699
It is impossible to convey
what high hopes he had for the boy...

1228
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:13,699
...and how he indulged
in a thousand fond anticipations...

1229
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:17,100
...as to his future success
and figure in the world.

1230
02:15:19,399 --> 02:15:23,699
But fate had determined that he should
leave none of his race behind him...

1231
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:26,800
...that he should finish his life...

1232
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
...poor, lonely...

1233
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:30,800
...and childless.

1234
02:15:39,399 --> 02:15:40,300
Papa.

1235
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:41,699
Yes, Bryan?

1236
02:15:41,899 --> 02:15:43,699
Will you buy me a horse?

1237
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:45,300
Buy you a horse?

1238
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:46,600
Yes, Papa.

1239
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:49,000
But you already have little Julia.

1240
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,899
She's only a pony, I want a real horse.

1241
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,199
Then I can ride with you on the hunt.

1242
02:15:54,399 --> 02:15:56,199
You think you're big enough for the hunt?

1243
02:15:56,199 --> 02:15:57,199
Oh, yes!

1244
02:15:57,500 --> 02:16:02,199
Jonathan Plunkett is only a year older
than I am and he rides with his papa.

1245
02:16:03,100 --> 02:16:04,899
I'll have to think about it.

1246
02:16:05,199 --> 02:16:10,000
Please, say yes. There's nothing I want
in the whole world more than a horse.

1247
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,399
I'll think about it.

1248
02:16:12,399 --> 02:16:14,600
Oh, thank you, Papa. Thank you!

1249
02:16:19,100 --> 02:16:21,100
How much are you asking for him?

1250
02:16:21,399 --> 02:16:22,899
One hundred guineas.

1251
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:27,000
He's a nice little horse,
but I don't think he's worth that.

1252
02:16:27,399 --> 02:16:30,000
Seventy-five seems
more like the right price.

1253
02:16:31,699 --> 02:16:35,100
I'll accept eighty guineas,
and not a shilling less.

1254
02:16:36,500 --> 02:16:40,100
Five guineas should never keep two
gentlemen from their drink. Eighty then.

1255
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:41,200
Done, sir.

1256
02:16:42,299 --> 02:16:46,700
Take the horse to Doolan's farm.
Tell him he needs a bit of breaking in.

1257
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:50,299
Say it's for Master Bryan's birthday,
and I want it to be a surprise.

1258
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:52,000
And remember that yourself.

1259
02:17:35,399 --> 02:17:36,399
Papa.

1260
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:39,600
What is it, lad?

1261
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:41,299
Did you buy that horse?

1262
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:45,700
What horse is that?

1263
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,899
The horse you were going
to buy me for my birthday.

1264
02:17:51,399 --> 02:17:53,399
I know nothing about any horse.

1265
02:17:53,899 --> 02:17:58,000
But one of the stable boys told Nelly
you'd already bought it...

1266
02:17:58,200 --> 02:18:02,000
...and it was at Doolan's farm
where Mick the groom was breaking it in.

1267
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:03,299
Is that true?

1268
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,000
When is your birthday?

1269
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:08,799
Next Tuesday.

1270
02:18:10,899 --> 02:18:13,700
Well, you'll have to wait till then
to find out.

1271
02:18:13,899 --> 02:18:17,100
Then, it's true! Oh, thank you, Papa.

1272
02:18:22,700 --> 02:18:23,799
Yes, Mama?

1273
02:18:24,899 --> 02:18:28,500
Promise me you won't ride that horse
except with your father.

1274
02:18:29,799 --> 02:18:31,700
Yes, Mama, I promise.

1275
02:18:32,799 --> 02:18:35,100
And I promise you a good flogging...

1276
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:38,700
...if you even go to Doolan's farm
to see him before your birthday.

1277
02:18:39,299 --> 02:18:40,200
Yes, Papa.

1278
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:41,100
You understand?

1279
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:42,500
Yes, Papa.

1280
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:44,000
You promise me?

1281
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:45,799
Yes, Papa, I promise.

1282
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:49,299
All right, eat your food.

1283
02:19:14,799 --> 02:19:17,100
I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr. Lyndon...

1284
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:19,600
...but I believe Master Bryan
has disobeyed you...

1285
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:21,799
...and stolen away to Doolan's farm.

1286
02:19:22,799 --> 02:19:26,100
On going to his room this morning,
I found his bed empty.

1287
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:29,100
One of the cooks saw him
cross the yard at daybreak.

1288
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,600
Didn't you see him go?

1289
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:33,799
He must have passed through my room
while I was asleep.

1290
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:08,299
Oh, my God! What has happened here?

1291
02:20:08,399 --> 02:20:12,500
I noticed the lad riding
across the field, sir...

1292
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:16,600
...and having trouble with the horse,
which was playing up.

1293
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:21,299
Suddenly the animal plunged and reared,
and the poor lad was thrown.

1294
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:26,200
Oh, Bryan, why did you disobey me?

1295
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:29,100
I'm sorry, Papa.

1296
02:20:29,700 --> 02:20:31,500
You won't whip me, will you?

1297
02:20:34,399 --> 02:20:35,799
No, my darling.

1298
02:20:36,899 --> 02:20:38,200
I won't whip you.

1299
02:20:42,299 --> 02:20:46,799
Take my horse and ride like the Devil
for Doctor Broughton.

1300
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:50,600
Tell him whatever he's doing
he must come at once. Understand?

1301
02:20:59,799 --> 02:21:01,500
The doctors were called.

1302
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:06,700
But what does a doctor avail in a contest
with the grim, invincible enemy?

1303
02:21:07,899 --> 02:21:12,500
Such as came could only confirm
the hopelessness of the poor child's case.

1304
02:21:14,100 --> 02:21:16,700
He remained with his parents
for two days.

1305
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:21,700
And a sad comfort it was to know
that he was in no pain.

1306
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:33,100
Papa.

1307
02:21:34,799 --> 02:21:36,899
Am I going to die?

1308
02:21:42,299 --> 02:21:46,700
No, my darling, you're not going to die.
You're going to get better.

1309
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:55,399
But I can't feel anything,
except in my hands.

1310
02:21:57,799 --> 02:22:01,500
Does that mean I'm already dead
in part of my body?

1311
02:22:08,799 --> 02:22:12,200
No, my darling, that's where
you were hurt by the horse.

1312
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:16,899
But you're going to be all right.

1313
02:22:21,299 --> 02:22:25,100
Papa, if I die, will I go to heaven?

1314
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:32,299
Of course you will, my darling...

1315
02:22:33,799 --> 02:22:35,799
...but you're not going to die.

1316
02:22:40,399 --> 02:22:42,100
Mama, give me your hand.

1317
02:22:51,799 --> 02:22:53,600
Papa, give me your hand.

1318
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:02,399
Will you both promise me something?

1319
02:23:05,399 --> 02:23:06,200
Yes.

1320
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:10,799
Promise me never to quarrel so.

1321
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:12,799
But to love each other.

1322
02:23:13,799 --> 02:23:17,600
So that we may meet again, in heaven...

1323
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:22,799
...where Bullingdon said
quarrelsome people will never go.

1324
02:23:30,799 --> 02:23:31,899
We promise.

1325
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:38,500
Will you tell me the story
about the fort?

1326
02:23:40,799 --> 02:23:41,899
Of course.

1327
02:23:45,899 --> 02:23:47,500
We crept up on the fort.

1328
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:56,799
I jumped over the wall first,
and my fellows jumped after me.

1329
02:23:57,399 --> 02:23:59,899
And you should have seen the look...

1330
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:07,000
...on the Frenchmen's faces when
23 he-devils, sword and pistol...

1331
02:24:07,700 --> 02:24:10,799
...cut and thrust,
came tumbling into the fort.

1332
02:24:12,399 --> 02:24:13,899
In three minutes...

1333
02:24:16,799 --> 02:24:18,000
...we left...

1334
02:24:27,799 --> 02:24:31,200
"'I am the resurrection and the life,'
saith the Lord.

1335
02:24:32,799 --> 02:24:36,299
"'He that believeth in me,
though he were dead...

1336
02:24:37,799 --> 02:24:39,399
"'... yet shall he live.

1337
02:24:40,299 --> 02:24:44,000
"'And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me...

1338
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:46,899
"'... shall never die.'

1339
02:24:49,299 --> 02:24:51,600
"I know that my Redeemer liveth...

1340
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:55,500
"...and that He shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth.

1341
02:24:56,299 --> 02:25:00,200
"And though after my skin
worms destroy this body...

1342
02:25:00,799 --> 02:25:04,299
"...yet in my flesh shall I see God.

1343
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:10,200
"Whom I shall see for myself
and mine eyes shall behold...

1344
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:12,200
"...and not another.

1345
02:25:14,399 --> 02:25:16,700
"We brought nothing into this world...

1346
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:20,000
"...and it is certain
we can carry nothing out.

1347
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:26,399
"The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away.

1348
02:25:27,299 --> 02:25:29,399
"Blessed is the name of the Lord."

1349
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:14,799
Barry's grief was inconsolable.

1350
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:19,799
Such solace as he could find,
came only from drink.

1351
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:27,399
His mother was the only person who would
remain faithful to him in his misfortune.

1352
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:32,200
And many a night, when he was
unconscious of her attention...

1353
02:26:32,399 --> 02:26:34,399
...saw him carried off to bed.

1354
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:41,100
"O blessed Lord...

1355
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:44,600
"...the Father of mercies
and God of all comforts.

1356
02:26:44,899 --> 02:26:48,399
"We beseech Thee, look down
in pity and compassion upon this...

1357
02:26:48,299 --> 02:26:50,100
"...Thy afflicted servant.

1358
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,200
"Thou writest bitter things against her...

1359
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:55,600
"...and makest her to possess
her former iniquities."

1360
02:26:55,500 --> 02:26:59,200
Her Ladyship,
always vapourish and nervous...

1361
02:26:59,600 --> 02:27:01,399
...plunged into devotion...

1362
02:27:01,399 --> 02:27:06,600
...with so much fervour, that you would
have imagined her distracted at times.

1363
02:27:30,299 --> 02:27:34,200
In the doleful conditions
which now prevailed at Castle Hackton...

1364
02:27:34,799 --> 02:27:38,299
...management of the household,
and of the Lyndon estate...

1365
02:27:38,899 --> 02:27:42,299
...fell to Mrs. Barry,
whose spirit of order...

1366
02:27:42,100 --> 02:27:46,500
...attended to all the details
of a great establishment.

1367
02:27:55,899 --> 02:27:57,600
You wish to see me, madam?

1368
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,299
Yes, Reverend. Please sit down.

1369
02:28:04,899 --> 02:28:07,899
I have some matters I would like
to discuss later, Graham...

1370
02:28:07,899 --> 02:28:10,000
...but just now would you go
to Her Ladyship...

1371
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,100
...and have her sign these papers.

1372
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:13,799
Yes, madam.

1373
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,500
Reverend Runt...

1374
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:32,100
...I need not tell you
that the recent tragedy to this family...

1375
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:36,000
...has made the services of a tutor
no longer required here.

1376
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:41,000
And as we are in considerable difficulty
about money...

1377
02:28:41,399 --> 02:28:45,299
...I'm afraid I must ask you,
with the greatest reluctance...

1378
02:28:45,700 --> 02:28:47,299
...to resign your post.

1379
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:56,700
Madam, I'm sensible
to your predicament...

1380
02:28:57,100 --> 02:29:01,899
...and you need have no concern about
my wages, I can willingly forego them...

1381
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:07,100
...but it is out of the question for me
to leave Her Ladyship in her present state.

1382
02:29:10,399 --> 02:29:12,500
I'm sorry to say this to you...

1383
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:17,700
...but I believe you are largely responsible
for her present state of mind.

1384
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:22,200
The sooner you leave,
the better she will be.

1385
02:29:27,299 --> 02:29:29,500
Madam, with the greatest respect...

1386
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,799
...I take my instructions
only from Her Ladyship.

1387
02:29:35,399 --> 02:29:36,799
Reverend Runt...

1388
02:29:37,399 --> 02:29:41,399
...Her Ladyship is in no fit mind
to give instructions to anyone.

1389
02:29:42,799 --> 02:29:46,299
My son has charged me with managing
the affairs at Castle Hackton...

1390
02:29:46,299 --> 02:29:50,600
...until he recovers from his grief and
resumes his interest in worldly matters.

1391
02:29:51,399 --> 02:29:52,799
While I'm in charge...

1392
02:29:52,799 --> 02:29:55,700
...you'll take your instructions from me.

1393
02:29:56,600 --> 02:29:58,799
My only concern is for Lady Lyndon.

1394
02:30:01,799 --> 02:30:02,799
Madam...

1395
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:07,600
...your only concern is
for Her Ladyship's signature.

1396
02:30:08,500 --> 02:30:13,100
You and your son have almost succeeded
in destroying a fine family fortune.

1397
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:16,000
And what little remains for you...

1398
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:19,299
...depends on keeping Her Ladyship
prisoner in her own home.

1399
02:30:19,500 --> 02:30:20,899
Reverend Runt...

1400
02:30:21,899 --> 02:30:24,600
...this matter bears
no further discussion.

1401
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:27,700
You will pack your bags
and leave by tomorrow.

1402
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:49,000
God, help. Help!

1403
02:30:52,600 --> 02:30:55,299
In the midst of these great perplexities...

1404
02:30:55,200 --> 02:30:58,799
...Her Ladyship made an attempt
to kill herself by taking poison.

1405
02:30:59,899 --> 02:31:02,700
Though she only made herself
dangerously ill...

1406
02:31:03,500 --> 02:31:06,299
...due to the very small amount
which she swallowed...

1407
02:31:06,299 --> 02:31:10,200
...this, nevertheless, caused
an intervention from a certain quarter...

1408
02:31:10,600 --> 02:31:12,299
...which was long overdue.

1409
02:31:12,299 --> 02:31:13,399
Oh, my God!

1410
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:46,299
If my mother had died...

1411
02:31:47,299 --> 02:31:49,700
...it would've been as much
my responsibility...

1412
02:31:49,700 --> 02:31:52,600
...as if I had poured
the strychnine for her myself.

1413
02:31:53,899 --> 02:31:56,899
For to the everlasting disgrace
of my family name...

1414
02:31:57,899 --> 02:32:01,100
...I have, by my cowardice,
and by my weakness...

1415
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,799
...allowed the Barrys
to establish a brutal...

1416
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,500
...and ignorant tyranny over our lives...

1417
02:32:07,799 --> 02:32:10,399
...which has left my mother
a broken woman...

1418
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:15,799
...and to squander and ruin
a fine family fortune.

1419
02:32:18,899 --> 02:32:22,899
My friends profess sympathy,
but behind my back...

1420
02:32:23,899 --> 02:32:25,600
...I know I am despised.

1421
02:32:26,799 --> 02:32:28,799
And quite justifiably so.

1422
02:32:35,799 --> 02:32:36,899
However...

1423
02:32:40,600 --> 02:32:42,399
...I know now what I must do.

1424
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:46,700
And what I shall do.

1425
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:50,600
Whatever be the cost.

1426
02:33:04,100 --> 02:33:05,799
Good morning, My Lord.

1427
02:33:06,100 --> 02:33:07,299
Good morning.

1428
02:33:08,299 --> 02:33:09,899
Is Mr. Barry Lyndon here?

1429
02:33:09,799 --> 02:33:11,600
Yes, My Lord, he's inside.

1430
02:34:46,399 --> 02:34:47,799
Mr. Redmond Barry.

1431
02:34:51,299 --> 02:34:53,600
The last occasion on which we met...

1432
02:34:54,299 --> 02:34:57,100
...you wantonly caused me injury
and dishonour.

1433
02:34:58,500 --> 02:35:03,500
In such a manner, and to such an extent
no gentleman can willingly suffer...

1434
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,200
...without demanding satisfaction...

1435
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:10,100
...however much time intervenes.

1436
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:17,500
I have now come to claim
that satisfaction.

1437
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:01,600
Mr. Lyndon...

1438
02:36:02,100 --> 02:36:05,200
...these are a matched pair of pistols,
and as you have seen...

1439
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:08,500
...your second has loaded one,
and I have loaded the other.

1440
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:12,799
As they belong to Lord Bullingdon,
you may have whichever one you wish.

1441
02:36:20,299 --> 02:36:21,799
Lord Bullingdon.

1442
02:36:29,399 --> 02:36:33,100
Now, gentlemen, to determine
who will have first fire...

1443
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:35,600
...I will toss a coin in the air.

1444
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:39,500
As the offended party, it is
Lord Bullingdon's choice to call the toss.

1445
02:36:40,500 --> 02:36:42,799
Is that agreeable to both of you?

1446
02:36:44,899 --> 02:36:45,899
Yes.

1447
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:52,000
If Lord Bullingdon calls correctly
he will have the first fire.

1448
02:36:53,100 --> 02:36:57,000
If incorrectly, Mr. Lyndon
will have the first fire.

1449
02:36:58,600 --> 02:37:00,399
Is that clearly understood?

1450
02:37:07,899 --> 02:37:10,200
What is your call, Lord Bullingdon?

1451
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:12,700
Heads.

1452
02:37:20,899 --> 02:37:22,000
It is heads.

1453
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:26,100
Lord Bullingdon will have the first fire.

1454
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:31,700
Lord Bullingdon...

1455
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:34,100
...will you take your ground?

1456
02:37:47,399 --> 02:37:49,799
One... two... three...

1457
02:37:49,700 --> 02:37:51,600
...four... five... six...

1458
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:55,000
...seven... eight... nine... ten.

1459
02:38:00,799 --> 02:38:03,700
Mr. Lyndon, will you take your ground?

1460
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:28,299
Mr. Lyndon, are you ready to receive
Lord Bullingdon's fire?

1461
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:40,200
Yes.

1462
02:38:43,899 --> 02:38:45,299
Lord Bullingdon...

1463
02:38:46,399 --> 02:38:48,000
...cock your pistol...

1464
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:50,299
...and prepare to fire.

1465
02:39:04,500 --> 02:39:06,899
Sir Richard, this pistol must be faulty.

1466
02:39:07,799 --> 02:39:09,600
I must have another one.

1467
02:39:10,299 --> 02:39:13,799
I'm sorry, Lord Bullingdon,
but you must first stand your ground...

1468
02:39:13,799 --> 02:39:16,200
...and allow Mr. Lyndon his turn to fire.

1469
02:39:19,399 --> 02:39:21,500
That is correct, Lord Bullingdon.

1470
02:39:22,399 --> 02:39:26,399
Your pistol has fired,
and that counts as your shot.

1471
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Mr. Lyndon, are the rules of firing
clear to you?

1472
02:39:45,700 --> 02:39:46,600
Yes.

1473
02:39:50,399 --> 02:39:51,799
Lord Bullingdon...

1474
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:55,799
...are you ready to receive
Mr. Lyndon's fire?

1475
02:40:02,299 --> 02:40:03,299
Yes.

1476
02:40:06,399 --> 02:40:07,899
Very well, then.

1477
02:40:11,100 --> 02:40:12,399
Mr. Lyndon...

1478
02:40:13,700 --> 02:40:15,200
...cock your pistol...

1479
02:40:16,100 --> 02:40:17,700
...and prepare to fire.

1480
02:41:12,399 --> 02:41:15,299
Are you ready, Lord Bullingdon?

1481
02:41:24,399 --> 02:41:26,600
Is your pistol cocked, Mr. Lyndon?

1482
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:30,500
Yes.

1483
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:37,000
Then prepare to fire.

1484
02:41:43,399 --> 02:41:44,500
One...

1485
02:41:46,100 --> 02:41:47,299
...two...

1486
02:41:59,100 --> 02:42:03,500
Lord Bullingdon, in view of Mr. Lyndon
having fired into the ground...

1487
02:42:03,700 --> 02:42:07,000
...do you now consider
that you have received satisfaction?

1488
02:42:20,100 --> 02:42:22,799
I have not received satisfaction.

1489
02:42:53,399 --> 02:42:55,500
Mr. Lyndon, are you ready?

1490
02:43:06,500 --> 02:43:07,399
Yes.

1491
02:43:09,899 --> 02:43:11,299
Lord Bullingdon...

1492
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:14,600
...cock your pistol
and get ready to fire.

1493
02:43:32,299 --> 02:43:33,399
One...

1494
02:43:36,100 --> 02:43:37,299
...two...

1495
02:43:56,600 --> 02:44:00,799
Barry was carried to an inn nearby
and a surgeon was called.

1496
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:15,600
I'm nearly finished.

1497
02:44:36,899 --> 02:44:39,899
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Mr. Lyndon.

1498
02:44:40,799 --> 02:44:43,299
I'm afraid you'll have to lose the leg...

1499
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,899
...most likely below the knee.

1500
02:44:54,200 --> 02:44:55,500
Lose the leg?

1501
02:44:57,100 --> 02:44:58,100
What for?

1502
02:45:00,299 --> 02:45:02,799
The simple answer is to save your life.

1503
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:08,100
The ball has shattered the bone
below the knee and severed the artery.

1504
02:45:09,299 --> 02:45:12,399
Unless I amputate, there's no way
that I can repair the artery...

1505
02:45:12,299 --> 02:45:14,000
...and stop the hemorrhage.

1506
02:45:44,500 --> 02:45:45,600
Graham.

1507
02:45:45,700 --> 02:45:46,899
Yes, My Lord?

1508
02:45:47,299 --> 02:45:51,899
When we arrive at Castle Hackton,
inform Mrs. Barry of what has happened.

1509
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:54,899
Don't go into any unnecessary detail.

1510
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Just tell her where he is
and that he has been wounded in the leg.

1511
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:01,399
She will want to go to him.

1512
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:06,200
See that she is out of the house and
on her way to London as soon as possible.

1513
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:07,299
And in no event...

1514
02:46:07,299 --> 02:46:10,000
...is she to be allowed to see my mother...

1515
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:13,399
...or create any disturbance at the house
before she leaves.

1516
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,200
Yes, My Lord.

1517
02:47:24,799 --> 02:47:26,700
Mrs. Barry, how do you do?

1518
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:29,799
How nice to see you, Graham.
Come in.

1519
02:47:29,700 --> 02:47:30,799
Thank you.

1520
02:47:32,399 --> 02:47:34,799
You... received my note?

1521
02:47:35,299 --> 02:47:36,899
Yes, we were expecting you.

1522
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,799
Oh, good, I didn't want
to call unannounced.

1523
02:47:40,899 --> 02:47:42,899
Mr. Lyndon, how are you feeling?

1524
02:47:44,700 --> 02:47:47,299
I'm feeling much better,
thank you, Graham.

1525
02:47:48,600 --> 02:47:49,899
Won't you sit down?

1526
02:47:49,799 --> 02:47:51,399
Thank you, Mrs. Barry.

1527
02:47:59,500 --> 02:48:01,200
Would you like some tea?

1528
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:04,399
Oh, no! No, thank you, Mrs. Barry.
Not just now.

1529
02:48:09,799 --> 02:48:11,899
How's the world treating you, Graham?

1530
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:13,600
Oh, not too bad.

1531
02:48:16,600 --> 02:48:18,600
Are you comfortable here?

1532
02:48:18,600 --> 02:48:19,899
Most comfortable.

1533
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,200
Good, good!

1534
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,500
Shall we get down to the matter at hand?

1535
02:48:39,299 --> 02:48:40,500
By all means.

1536
02:48:46,600 --> 02:48:47,899
Mr. Lyndon...

1537
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:53,500
...Lord Bullingdon has instructed me...

1538
02:48:54,200 --> 02:48:57,200
...to offer you an annuity...

1539
02:48:57,899 --> 02:49:01,700
...of 500 guineas a year for life.

1540
02:49:03,899 --> 02:49:07,000
Specifically on the condition of your...

1541
02:49:08,700 --> 02:49:10,399
...leaving England...

1542
02:49:10,899 --> 02:49:13,600
...and to be stopped...

1543
02:49:14,600 --> 02:49:16,799
...the instant of your return.

1544
02:49:19,700 --> 02:49:23,799
Lord Bullingdon has also asked me
to point out to you...

1545
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:27,700
...that should you decide to remain here...

1546
02:49:28,399 --> 02:49:32,100
...your stay would infallibly plunge you...

1547
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:35,500
...into jail.

1548
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:41,700
As in view of the present circumstances
there will soon be...

1549
02:49:42,500 --> 02:49:45,600
...innumerable writs taken out
against you for...

1550
02:49:45,899 --> 02:49:48,000
...debts long-outstanding...

1551
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:51,799
...and your credit is so blown that...

1552
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:54,799
...you could not hope...

1553
02:49:55,299 --> 02:49:56,899
...to raise a shilling.

1554
02:50:26,299 --> 02:50:28,399
Utterly baffled and beaten...

1555
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:33,000
...what was the lonely
and broken-hearted man to do?

1556
02:50:34,799 --> 02:50:38,600
He took the annuity and returned
to Ireland with his mother...

1557
02:50:39,100 --> 02:50:41,000
...to complete his recovery.

1558
02:50:42,100 --> 02:50:44,600
Sometime later he traveled abroad.

1559
02:50:46,500 --> 02:50:50,299
His life there, we have not the means
of following accurately.

1560
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:54,600
He appears to have resumed
his former profession of a gambler...

1561
02:50:54,600 --> 02:50:56,500
...without his former success.

1562
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
He never saw Lady Lyndon again.

1563
