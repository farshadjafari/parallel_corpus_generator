2
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,700
The late fourth century A.D. the
Roman Empire began to crumble.

3
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,700
Alexandria, in the province of Egypt,
still retained some of its lustre,...

4
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,700
...possessed one of the Seven
Wonders of the ancient world:...

5
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,200
...the legendary lighthouse,
and the biggest library known.

6
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:47,799
The library was a not only
cultural but a religious symbol,...

7
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,799
a place where the pagans worshiped
their ancestral gods.

8
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,399
The traditional pagan worship
in the city now coexisted...

9
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,899
...with the Jews, and an unstoppable
religion up to now banned,...

10
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,899
...Christianity.

11
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Library of Alexandria, 391 A.D.

12
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,900
After taking the library, many
pagans were converted...

13
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,900
Hipatia continued teaching and
researching,...

14
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,900
...while his former students held...

15
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,900
...important positions in the
social elite.

16
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,900
The empire was split in two forever.

17
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,900
Many Christians saw this as a
sign of the end of the world...

18
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,900
...and decided to prepare by
practicing a more holy life.

19
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,400
The order of "Parabolanos" monks
was charged to go...

20
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,900
...through the streets and watch
for Christian morality...

21
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:50,000
...now uneven by the presence
of the Jews.

22
00:56:55,400 --> 00:01:21,400
The Library, years later.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,000
How many fools
have wondered

24
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,700
why not the stars fall
from the sky

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,799
<i> But you,
not happy to cease of the wise, </ i>

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,299
<i> You know that the stars
do not move up or down. </ i>

27
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,000
only reborn <i>
from east to west, </ i>

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,500
<i> following the most perfect post
ever can see , </ i>

29

<i> circle. </ i>

30
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,900
Because the circle <i> reigns
in heaven, </ i>

31
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,200
<i> the stars would never have fallen
and never will. </ i>

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,000
But what about here on Earth?

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,900
Here, bodies do fall.

34
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,099
But their movements
are not circular but linear.

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,500
Look again.

36
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,400
Again.

37
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,000
No, leave it.

38
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,699
So,

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
<i> What mysterious wonder
do you would think </ i>

40
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:25,000
<i> that may lurk beneath the earth
for every single person and animal, </ i>

41
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,900
<i> and object and all laid exact

42
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,800
What may should be?

43
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,400
The highness, madame.

44
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,699
No.

45
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,300
Sinesio.

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,900
The weighty.

47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,000
<i> No, you both speaking about the same thing,
but you not talking about primary course. </ i>

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Has anyone ever thought about
your..

49
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:56,699
your feet ...

50
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,000
your feet

51
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,400
<i> standing perched on the
very center of the cosmos </ i>

52
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,199
that holds all things together,
pull them together

53
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,199
If there is no center,
the universe would be

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,199
deformed, infinite, formless,

55
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,699
<i> chaotic. </ i>

56
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,199
Doesn't matter that we were <i>

57
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,599
What you will do? That's right
never being born

58
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,599
Library of Alexandria 391 AD

59
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,099
God, Our Father,

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
lord of the universe,

61
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,199
origin of all things,

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,099
eternal force of the cosmos,

63
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,099
where everything has
its beginning and its end.

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,900
Mighty Serapis,
Isis, Horus,

65
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:58,599
And all the gods Anubis
that protect us

66
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,099
both in heaven
and on earth ...

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,699
Something happens in the market.

68
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,100
I know you also feel something.
I've seen.

69
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,100
Tell the master that we leave.

70
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,699
Can you believe. He was counting me
as the part of their conquests

71
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,199
This Orestes also foolish
as his father.

72
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,199
I have already suggested that you take
his heart to another muse

73
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,899
one more beautiful than me.

74
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,199
- Who?
The music.

75
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,199
<i> Music </ i>

76
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,500
He find his music.

77
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,000
What happen 227 had become
16 ?

78
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,899
Divide  with 14.

79
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,899
<i> They behave like humans!
Eat, drink and fornicate! </ I>

80
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,000
If my gods <i> eat, drink
and fornicate, good for them </ i>

81
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,500
Know this,

82
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,699
you who console yourself
with pagan images.

83
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,600
Men, women,
birds, reptiles!

84
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,399
Serapis!

85
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,100
Serapis! Who could trust
the God, need a flower pot

86
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,000
for crown?

87
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,300
Hey You, Christians, how arrogant you
to take another

88
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,800
Empire attitude like this

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,699
My father's father saw them

90
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:18,800
slaughtered at the circus

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
and ate to the lions.

92
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
Enough! Watch.

93
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,000
Watch.

94
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,800
You see now
I walk cross the fire.

95
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,300
If my god ...

96
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:40,399
If my God is the true god,
I unscathed, no hurt.

97
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,199
And if your gods exist,

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
<i> they'll roast me like a pig. </ i>

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,100
You ...

100
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,300
You're lie!

101
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,899
You'll burn!

102
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:54,199
You will have what you deserve!

103
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,399
Let's see if you can walk cross
the fire.

104
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,199
What are you doing?

105
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
<i> Stop, you can not do that!
Leave him alone. </ I>

106
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,500
<i> Quiet! or you will follow. </ i>

107
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,299
Who is this?

108
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,500
Who is this?

109
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,000
How many times should I
must repeat message?

110
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Today,

111
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,799
Christians
burn a man.

112
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,799
Right in the middle of agora!

113
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,200
I will not have this in my house!

114
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,700
Not in the house of Theon!

115
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,299
Give it to me.

116
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,399
Give it to me!

117
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,899
No terrific mercy is way go

118
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
- Davo!
Get up.

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
You have nothing to do
with this.

120
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,700
I do, i am a Christian.

121
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,200
<i> What did you say? </ i>

122
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,200
I do. I am a Christian
Punish both of us.

123
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,799
So, now we'll presume to teach
us a mercy

124
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Get a whip.
- Father!

125
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,299
Calm ...

126
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,299
Father, I beg you.
I begged you

127
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:59,299
wrapped in.. in blazing, right?

128
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,399
To the flames, stupid.

129
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,799
<i> Why did not you burned like the heathen?
Tell me. </ I>

130
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,600
Leave us ...

131
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,799
Come here.

132
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,299
Kneel.

133
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,700
<i> Tell me, is true
you are a Christian? </ i>

134
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,899
I do not know what to say, madame.
- Why not?

135
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,399
If i say yes, that will be a lie

136
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:02,299
If I said no, i lied to
my master and I do not know which is worse.

137
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,299
Then say nothing.

138
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,799
That's it.

139
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,200
Thank you.

140
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,399
<i> The master is very angry

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,000
What is that?

Have you done?

148
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Earth

149
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,299
is the center of the cosmos

150
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,700
and revolve around

151
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,500
the sun

152
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,200
and the five wanderers: Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

153
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,799
Never disobeying
the law of the circle.Never

<i> own each wandering. </ i>

Loop, the epicycles
"say you see is not happen on the earth"

163
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,600
but our eyes
deceive us.

164
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,700
Well search, Davo.

165
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:36,299
I like you do the explanation search even
paying course attention or not

166
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,600
One or two..up here

167
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,799
I tell you The Gods should consulted
to me before they creating anything.

168
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,899
Why say that?

169
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
<i> It's all so whimsical! </ i>

170
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,299
Why is the joint take of
two circles?

171
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,000
Would not be more, perfect
if the wander is..

172
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
if wander and a single circle
give sense to everything?

173
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,299
What authority do you judge
the work of God?

174
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,700
What is wrong with you, Christians?

175
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,100
The man is no longer with brief mouth
in this city

176
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:16,799
Could you decide creation, you could decide
a Lord,

177
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,299
and you offended.
You should move to the desert.

178
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,299
You will not hear anything offensive there.

179
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,799
You know nothing about you speak.

Are you going to attack them?

354

The insult must to be answered.

From now on, in Alexandria

Damn Jews!

628
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,099
They're just a bunch of thugs,
a bunch of animals.

629
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,900
Joran, my dear friend, calm down.

630
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,599
Let Bishop Cyril
begun his own depend.

631
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:26,300
Prefect

632
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,199
our blessed parabolans,

633
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,099
Hung hi has just called

634
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:33,199

637
00:59:39,699 --> 00:59:40,900
And stones!

638
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:42,699
Prefect can carry stones.

639
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,300
I know they was enter the theater

640
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,400
and stoned knowing we'll do nothing
to defend

641
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,800
Non sense. Because it is the Sabbath!

642
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,199
On the Sabbath you should
honor God

643
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,000
in your synagogues
instead stopping yourself

644
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:56,699
set in theater.

645
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,199
Therefore I showered stones.

646
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,099
<i> Prefect, you hear that?
Now he threatened us. It is too much..</ i>

647
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,400
Friends, there are more things that unite
us than divide us.

648
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,599
We are brothers!
We are all brothers

649
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,699
Where would you Christians be

650
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,900
without the Jews?
Jesus was a Jew!

651
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:17,300
Jesus was Jewish!

652
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,199
There is .a .something I find

653
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,199
stubbing what You've told.

654
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
- What?
Well,

655
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,099
Why Cyril begin
to cleaning up the city?

656
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,400
is he not satisfied
with what they already have?

657
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:02,599
He just wants to scare the Jews.

658
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,500
but why you say then before..

659
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,800
What if really interesting.. you
and not them?

660
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,599
Me?

661
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,400
Why?
I'm as Christian as he.

662
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,500
Yes, but forget

663
01:01:13,699 --> 01:01:16,500
that many of your friends
that circle are not.

664
01:01:16,699 --> 01:01:18,500
A full sail, prefect.

665
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,500
Lets go.

666
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,800
-Aspasius, you ready?
Yes, mistress.

667
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,900
I would like you to take the sack
and flying to top the mast.

668
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:46,800
And now, Lady,

669
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,699
Will you finally tell me what
the point?

670
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,099
When Aspasius

671
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,099
drop the sack, the boat
will be moving forward.

672
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,599
Therefore, the sack

673
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,400
not fall at the foot of the mast,

674
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:03,599
but will fall further back.
About ...

675
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,599
here.

676
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:10,800
And what's so special about that?

677
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:26,800
- Yes!
- But You're wrong!

678
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Yes, but this is definitely
proved

679
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:30,699
<i> definitive. The sack </ i>

680
01:02:32,199 --> 01:02:34,599
has behaved as if
the boat stationary.

681
01:02:34,699 --> 01:02:36,400
<i> What does that mean? </ i>

682
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,400
 i do not know.

683
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,699
But the same principle can
be applied to the Earth.

684
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,500
we could be moving around the sun
without our knowledge.

685
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,400
<i>-Aristarchus.
Exactly. </ I>

686
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:56,000
Why are you troubled yourself
by that, Lady?

687
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:58,699
Ptolemy <i> not perfect, </ i>

688
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,400

Orestes, as this with you warrior ...

690
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:06,800
A few years ago you was not
so pragmatic, prefect.

691
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,599
A few years ago i spoke first
before thinking.

692

I have Cepheus <i> third. </ i>

share house in Aquarius.

697
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:50,599
My father would have celebrated
something like a good wine.

698
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,400
The stars will not fall.

What chance for you talking about?

01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,099
Do not you know that the universe
is a huge chest, don't you?

703
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,500
They laid on top
and the Earth ground.

704
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:16,699
In this idiot not been told
that the Earth is round!

705
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,500
The Earth is flat.

706
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:20,699
Your head is really flat.

707
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:22,400
Read the Scriptures!

708
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,599
If the earth is round,

709
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,599
Why not the people that live
in the bottom, fall out?

710
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,800
What about the one sides?

711
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,900
Why not slip?

712
01:04:35,699 --> 01:04:37,199
Think about it.

713
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,199
Davo knows.

714
01:04:40,699 --> 01:04:41,699

01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,099
What do you say?

716
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,099
Does the earth is flat or round?

717
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,199
Only God knows these things.

718
01:04:56,699 --> 01:04:57,800

Today in the boat you make
great progress.

722
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:09,000
Why do the wandering very

And what is worse,

Why does the sun?

Why is change size
summer to winter?

727
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:22,500
Perhaps it's because

01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,199
But Aspasia

731
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,400
watch.

732
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:35,500
According Aristarchus, the sun must be

733
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:37,199
in the center of everything.

734
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:40,300
With us, the Earth,

735
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,400
traveling in a circle around him.

736
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,500
Therefore,

737
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,400
and this is the key

738
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:52,800
We are always exactly

739
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,500
same ...

740
01:05:57,199 --> 01:05:58,400
distance.

741
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,699
If, as you say,
accept that changes the distance,

742
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,599
that forces us to add

743
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:06,800
epicycle into orbit
Earth.

744
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,800
<i> To be closer
and then farther away. </ i>

745
01:06:12,099 --> 01:06:14,300
Now then we fall
in the same trap as Ptolemy.

746
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,099
<i>-circles upon circles.
- Exactly! </ I>

747
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,599
I do not know how to solve
this conflict.

748
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,800
<i> let me know we can do it </ i>

749
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:33,300

01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,500
<i> And not having a center </ i>

751
01:06:36,099 --> 01:06:37,599
My heart, Aspasia.

752
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,699
So,

753
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,199
What do we do?

754
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,000
Resting, lady.

755
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,199
Parabolans!

756
01:07:00,699 --> 01:07:02,900

It is a fire.

Come on!

01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,699
Gather water! The cube!
Take it!

01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:22,400

764

Come, come!

Parabolans, quick!

768
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,500
Where's the fire?

769
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,500
Where's the fire?

770
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,099
Jews! It's a trap.

771
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,699
It's a trap!

772
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,699
Christians all

773
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,100
last night is one night was deplorable.

774
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,399
Now I say to you .

775
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:34,199
Grave no longer
for our dead brothers.

776
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:36,699
weep not.

777
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,399
Said you killed for the others,

778
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:45,300
but they are executioners.

779
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,699
Yes, yes.

780
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,699
Weep for them.
Then they

781
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:02,000
they know neither God,

782
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,500
neither love nor holiness.

783
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,699
I do not know.

784
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,600
because in this day

785
01:10:10,699 --> 01:10:14,100
who repeated the Scriptures
without understanding at all.

786
01:10:15,699 --> 01:10:18,500
It is they who saw
only a man

787
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,399
when the Son of God
standing on the front of us.

788
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,199
And it is they who

Lady, do not stop, Lady.

802
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:19,699
Now whole the Jews
want revenge!

803
01:12:19,899 --> 01:12:22,100
I'm afraid you do not understand
what is really happening.

804
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:27,199
<i> When this is over,

Where are the troops?

808
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:44,199
Why do not more soldiers
on the streets?

809
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:47,500
No army can contain
entire city.

Calling to the annihilation <i>

822
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I see.

823
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,800
But if you do nothing now,

824
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,100
I believe that Cyril

825
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:39,699
will continue do the same thing
over and over again

826
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:45,000
until no people
for this government to govern.

827
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,399
How naive with me.

828
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,199

01:15:24,199 --> 01:15:25,899
The Bishop of Cyrene.

833
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,899
- What is he doing here?
I'll find out

834
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:33,800
It's my little library
of Alexandria.

835
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:40,199
This is where I teach children.

836
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,300

It's beautiful.

01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,000
Often I look and wonder

845
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,000

Forgive me.

852
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,300
Two Christians in the hands
of a pagan.

I can not forgive.

Forgive?

868
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,399
Who?

869

Jews?

870
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,300
Jesus forgave on the cross.

871
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,600
Jesus was God

872
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,800
and only he can show
such leniency.

873
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:25,199

Why?

877
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,399
Because it was

01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,500
God wants us here,
doing what we do.

880
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,100
To believe in that belief?

01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,399
Why, then,

915
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:47,500
should this assembly

916
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:51,399
accept the consult of
someone who ability dilution

917
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,600
absolutely nothing?

918
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,500
I believe in philosophy.

919
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,800
Philosophy.

920
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,199
Just what we need

921
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,100
in such times.

922
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,399
Enough!

923
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,199
I've been studying

924
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,399
absolutely no life.
for my own

925
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,800
And I wonder

926
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:34,600
wow.
- Forget about what i said today.

927
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,699
Is all
life holds for me?

928
01:21:41,899 --> 01:21:43,100
What else?

929
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,600
I doubt anyone can see

930
01:21:46,899 --> 01:21:48,199
as devoted wife

931
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:49,399
and mother.

932
01:21:50,199 --> 01:21:51,300
I think ...

933
01:21:51,899 --> 01:21:54,800
I think the whole city
know the history of the handkerchief.

934
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,500
So ...

935
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,800
My father loved that one.

936
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,699
Even <i> he ...</ i>

937
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:11,300
Who have the loved?

938
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,100
Except you,

939
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,399
Lebanon.

940
01:22:28,699 --> 01:22:30,100
If only I could ...

941
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,399
fathom this ...

942
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,000
a little more.

943
01:22:41,899 --> 01:22:45,000
<i> And get a little closer
the response, </ i>

944
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,199

enough go to grave, happy.

946
01:22:53,699 --> 01:22:54,800
Why?

947
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,300
Why that's mean so much to you?

948
01:23:00,199 --> 01:23:01,399
Right now,

949
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:06,300
this every second,
whole earth could be moving

950
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,500
and no one realized it.

951
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,100
<i> Except you and me </ i>

952
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,500
Believe me Lady, it's best
that nobody notices.

953
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,199
Really not it important?

954
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:20,800
i Do not understand why you insist
moving the ground they walk on.

955
01:23:21,399 --> 01:23:23,100
Dress yourself
what happened on the boat.

956
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:26,100
Yes i dit,But that does not mean
this sailing on the earth moves.

957
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,399
<i> What if it does </ i>

958
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Hypatia, look around.

959
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,500
Death,

960
01:23:32,699 --> 01:23:33,899
horror

961
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,399
destruction.

962
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,199
<i> If the stars move in
the Circle, </ i>

01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,100
<i> why they share
perfection with us </ i>

964
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,500
So we are not moving.

965
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,100
In circle.

966
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:48,800
We do not move ...

<i> circle. </ i>

968
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:57,100
We move in circles.

969
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,399
Since Plato,

970
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,199
all of them: Aristarchus
Hipparchus, Ptolemy,

971
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:15,100
all have tried
reconcile their observations

972
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,100
<i> with circular orbits. </ i>

973
01:24:17,399 --> 01:24:19,600
<i> but What happen
otherwise hidden </ i>

974
01:24:19,899 --> 01:24:21,500
Another way?

975
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,699
Lady, There is no purer than the
circle, you yourself have taught us.

976
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:27,800
I know, but suppose

977
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,100
that the purity

978
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:32,899
the circle
prevented us from seeing beyond.

979
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:35,100
Just like the sunshine
prevents us from seeing

980
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,800
stars.

981
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,899
I must begin again

982
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,399
with new eyes.

983
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:45,100
I have to rethink everything.

984
01:24:45,699 --> 01:24:46,600
All.

985
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,600
Reading the first letter
Paul to Timothy.

986
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,600
I therefore wish
that everywhere

987
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:10,199
men would lift their prayers

988
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,800
without anger or disputes.

989
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:16,399
Equally,

990
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,000
that women desire

991
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,500
dress modestly,

992
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,399
decency and propriety

993
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,000
without braids in her hair

994
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,100
or gold or pearls

995
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,100
or expensive clothes,

996
01:25:34,899 --> 01:25:37,500
-but with good deeds.''
- Why read this passage?

997
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:41,300
I do not know, I promise
which is not agreed.

998
01:25:42,199 --> 01:25:44,300
Let the woman learn

999
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,699
<i> quiet and full submission,
i can't allow a woman </ i>

1000
01:25:47,899 --> 01:25:51,199

1001
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:55,199
but to be

1002
01:25:55,899 --> 01:25:57,399
silent

1003
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,699

Amen.

1006
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,199
Jesus himself

1007
01:26:12,899 --> 01:26:14,800
knew this when

1008
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,100

Nothing woman among them.

The philosopher Hypatia.

A woman who declare,

1018
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:46,800

Listen!

Why did can not we do more
easy and effective?

What do you talking about?

1139
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,800
We can hurts........

- Who?

1144
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:05,000
What shape would it show us?
what shape

1145
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:08,600
You said once the problem
is the inconsistency of the sun.

1146
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,600
Yes I did, good..good
Put it into words.

1147
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:16,199
The sun must be at the center
as we turned around.

1148
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:17,600
And at the same time

1149
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:21,100
in another position seen the
distance from it varies.

1150
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,000
Yes, exactly.
- How?

1151
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:33,000
How could occupy
two position?

1152
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,100
How can occupy
two position at once?

1153
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,300
How can occupy
two position ?

1154
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,100
Aspasius ...

1155
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:15,899
Yes, yes. There.
And the other one here.

1156
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:18,000
Maintaining the same proportion.

1157
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,899
Okay.
Tie this end there.

1158
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:32,000
Aspasia

1159
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:34,800
imagines that this is Earth

1160
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:39,199
<i> and the each of flames represent the two
extreme positions of the sun relation to it: </ i>

1161
01:38:39,399 --> 01:38:40,899
in winter and summer.

1162
01:38:41,699 --> 01:38:45,699
<i> What happen if both positions
were the two centers </ i>

1163
01:38:46,199 --> 01:38:47,500
<i> of the same circle </ i>

1164
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,100
That is impossible, mistress.

1165
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,899
wait what we know about the circle?
We know that center of the circles

1166
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,699
<i> is always same distance to any point
its perimeter. </ i>

1167
01:38:55,899 --> 01:38:56,899
<i> Exactly.
Yes. </ I>

1168
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:58,600
What if the center divided into two

1169
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:03,800
<i> but keep constant the sum
distances to its perimeter </ i>

1170
01:39:05,699 --> 01:39:09,199
Okay, I'll show you what.
As I move this rod along

1171
01:39:09,399 --> 01:39:11,500
the rope,
a segment increases

1172
01:39:11,699 --> 01:39:13,800
and the other decreases.
And vice versa.

1173
01:39:14,899 --> 01:39:16,899
Thus the sum of the two always..

1174
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:19,000
constant. You see that?

1175
01:39:20,199 --> 01:39:23,600
We apply this, to the movement

1176
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,899
Earth?

1177
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:40,600
What ...

1178
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:44,899
will be ...

1179
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,300
obtained ?

1180
01:39:50,899 --> 01:39:52,100
An ellipse!

1181
01:39:52,899 --> 01:39:56,300
<i> An ellipse with the sun
in one focus. </ i>

1182
01:39:58,199 --> 01:39:59,300

Maybe i just .. ..

1188
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:19,699
Perhaps you ...

1189
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,000
What do you think?

1190
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,600
This could be solved, mistress.

1191
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:50,899
Well done, we will
with this tomorrow.

1192
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,000
Get some sleep.

Good night, mistress.
Good night.

Where is everybody?

1202
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,100
Please sit down.
