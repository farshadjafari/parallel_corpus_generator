1
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,258
How long?

2
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,803
A day, maybe two.

3
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,533
They're away and gone, Rob,
and the beasts sold.

4
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,744
There's a wee glen on
the other side of Ben Duh.

5
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,875
If I were tinkers with a two-day start,
I'd lie out there and kill me some meat.

6
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,670
We'd not get there
before dark, Rob.

7
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,755
Not stood here,
we won't.

8
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,048
You can smell them
through the meat.

9
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,091
Aye, if they fought as
strong as they smelled,

10
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,926
we'd be in trouble.

11
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,265
They're there right enough,
just like you said, Rob.

12
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,522
We can rush them
when they're asleep.

13
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,441
Ten of them to six of us.

14
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,860
Nine.
One of them's a woman.

15
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,030
Half of them would be dead
before they were awake.

16
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,616
How are we going
to take them, Rob?

17
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,453
I'll go and talk to them in the morning.

18
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,886
I'm getting
too old for this,

19
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,681
lying wet-arsed in the heather,
chasing other men's cattle.

20
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,143
Come away to the Americas with me.

21
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,563
They say there's fine acres
for the clearing in Virginia.

22
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:42,192
Aye, and they'll likely be
as hard as these to sleep on.

23
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,364
Why are you going in
to talk to them?

24
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,616
I know one of them.

25
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,821
Up!

26
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,867
Get up, you bunch of
ragged-arsed tinker cow thieves!

27
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,419
This is Robert Roy MacGregor
come to reclaim the 32 beasts

28
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:46,798
stolen from His Lordship James
Graham, Marquis of Montrose.

29
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,676
Tam Sibbald.

30
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,970
Still at your thieving.

31
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,516
Throw down now and I'll
spare you, all but one.

32
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,021
There's a price to being
a leader of men, Tam.

33
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,150
By God, MacGregor,

34
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,487
if there's any killing to
be done, you're the first.

35
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,991
Who do you think you are,
acting the great chief?

36
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,828
And I know you're a bigger
thief than any of us.

37
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,707
Aye, but if I had stolen
His Lordship's cattle,

38
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,377
you would not have come
walking into my dreams so easy.

39
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,089
I can call the Gregorach
and kill the half of you,

40
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,675
or it can be between us
and nothing more.

41
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,094
Think on it, man.

42
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,721
Would you not rather
be dead this morning

43
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,807
after a good hump and a
belly full of stolen beef,

44
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,809
or would you have me
march you back to Montrose

45
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,355
so you can shit yourself
on the gallows a month hence?

46
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,577
Throw down! Now!

47
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,497
And you have my word
no one else will die!

48
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,921
Come, lads.

49
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,132
And any man with a blade
in his hands, cut him down.

50
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,016
Are you men,
or what are you?

51
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,562
He killed Tam,
and you stand and live!

52
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,565
And him as much an outlaw as any of you!

53
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,403
No man among you!
Your mothers curse you!

54
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,822
You're spittle!
You're leavings!

55
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,662
Listen to me well,
and remember this,

56
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,791
or I'm going to remember
you, every last one.

57
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,543
When next you think
to steal cattle,

58
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,129
have a care they're not
under my protection.

59
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,382
But if they are, you're not
stealing from their owners.

60
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,760
You're stealing from me,
Robert Roy MacGregor.

61
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,555
And no man who steals
my beasts makes a profit.

62
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,057
If you doubt me,
ask Tam Sibbald.

63
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,023
What are you going
to do with her?

64
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,861
Be on your way, and tell no
man you fared ill at our hands.

65
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,362
Go on.

66
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,840
Cut him down!
Slash him!

67
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,552
Go on.

68
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,028
Yeah!

69
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:41,574
Ladies and gentlemen, the
winner of the contest is Guthrie!

70
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,288
Montrose, come hotfoot
from the court to the cockpit.

71
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,375
May I present
Archibald Cunningham.

72
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,502
His Grace,
the Duke of Argyll.

73
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,963
I am Your Grace's
humble servant.

74
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,675
Another of your
likely lads?

75
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,845
Archibald is sent me
by his mother,

76
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,807
in the hope that our climate
might cool the fever in his blood.

77
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,393
So, Mr. Cunningham,

78
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,730
what are these principal sins
that distress your mother?

79
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,565
Dice? Drink?

80
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,317
Or are you
a buggerer of boys?

81
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,654
It is years, Your Grace,
since I buggered a boy.

82
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,448
And in my own defense,
I must add,

83
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,575
I thought him a girl
at the moment of entry.

84
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,038
What say you, Guthrie, that Archie
could not tell arse from quim?

85
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,751
I've heard that many Englishmen
have that same difficulty.

86
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,627
Spoken as well
as you fought.

87
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,963
Did you see Guthrie here
at work, Mr. Cunningham?

88
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,924
He has a fair hand with the
cleaver, it must be said.

89
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,178
You do not think much of
our Highland tools, then?

90
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:47,682
If I had to kill an ox, a claymore
would be my first choice, Your Grace.

91
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:54,481
You best use a musket and
save the beast a slow dying.

92
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,526
I would not need a
musket for you, Guthrie.

93
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,320
Splendid!

94
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:04,491
I'll wager 100 of what you
like on Guthrie and his cleaver.

95
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,034
At odds?

96
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,953
Now, come, James,
you're a fox. What odds?

97
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,455
Three?
Two.

98
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,081
English pounds.

99
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,084
There's more of
a jingle to guineas.

100
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,338
Guineas it is.
Excellent, excellent.

101
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,049
A bumper of Rhenish for my
Lord Montrose and myself,

102
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,010
and show Mr. Cunningham
what blades we have.

103
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,395
You honor me, sir, to
serve me with your own hand.

104
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,981
I tell you, James,

105
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,819
I forget how much you dislike
me until I'm in your presence.

106
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,238
So, what news at court?

107
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,115
What else
but the succession?

108
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,786
Our poor queen cannot find
the time to die in peace.

109
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,498
I fear she may pass over and
leave the matter unresolved.

110
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,126
Would that she had seen a child of
hers live to comfort the kingdom.

111
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,338
Aye. One might have hoped that
a field so regularly ploughed

112
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,174
might have yielded
one good crop.

113
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,178
In truth, I have seen healthier
graveyards than that woman's womb.

114
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,000
Come on!

115
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,678
I am asked continually on what side
Your Grace will declare himself.

116
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:53,349
Where Argyll goes, the
path must be firm and broad.

117
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,395
And now all watch
to see which way to jump.

118
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,106
One cannot go
to the closet

119
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,192
but what some adherent to
James is praising your pish.

120
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,176
And I confess to a certain
weariness in this whole issue,

121
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,512
and look for the light of
Your Grace to give some lead.

122
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,097
And all I could answer,
in honesty,

123
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:37,018
was that it would be the one
most inclined to his own benefit.

124
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,939
Damn it, man. But you talk too
much. Can you not tend to your wager?

125
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,068
Argyll,
my wager is well won.

126
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,118
Damn it, Guthrie!

127
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:41,082
Is it not enough that you're beaten,
but you must turn backstabber?

128
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,422
My factor will call upon
Your Grace's factor.

129
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,874
Well done, Rob, man.

130
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,697
Cut out another
of the cattle.

131
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,574
If the tinkers ate one,
they could have eaten two.

132
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,243
Montrose will charge you, nonetheless.

133
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,830
I'm weary of seeing children
hungry and old folk cold.

134
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,541
It'll take more than
a cow to fix that, Rob.

135
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,086
Aye. Well, you'll be in the
Americas, living off the fat,

136
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,962
so it won't worry you.

137
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,673
Will you have some broth,
Rob? No, Coll. I'm for home.

138
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,800
God bless you, Rob.

139
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:18,471
And then Rob just walks in among
them, his sword still in its sheath,

140
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,184
And says, "Up. Get up, you
bunch of ragged-arsed... "

141
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,268
Hello, Rob.

142
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,728
Hello, Rob!

143
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,107
"Get up, you bunch of
ragged-arsed tinker cow thieves!"

144
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,651
And Rob up to him
and says,

145
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:36,072
"Tell your crew to lay down
and I'll only cut your throat,

146
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,198
"else I'll call my men. "

147
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,659
And we're all there.
We are ready.

148
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,367
Get up, boy.
Come on.

149
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,829
Go on. Get.

150
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,147
I dreamed
a selkie came.

151
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,660
And what did he do
to you, your selkie?

152
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,539
You wakened me
before the best of it.

153
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,670
But he would have
ravished me for certain.

154
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,553
How do you know
you're awake, wife?

155
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,152
Mr. Killearn.
I'm on my way.

156
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,655
Aye. Well on the way,
I'd venture.

157
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,159
Let me be, Mr. Killearn. You'll
wake him. Don't, Mr. Killearn!

158
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:12,079
I'm sure the young master has
you nicely greased, does he not?

159
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,000
Betty, you'd hardly
feel me going in.

160
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,940
A wee whiff of quim in the
morning, Mr. Cunningham, sir.

161
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,363
Just the thing
to clear your head.

162
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,537
Mr. Cunningham, I hope
I'm not disturbing you.

163
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,999
Of course you're bloody
well disturbing me.

164
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,546
Do you think
I want to wake up

165
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,300
and find some great smelly
Scotchman staring down at me?

166
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,732
What are you doing here?

167
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,151
I wanted to tell you that
some of the local trades people

168
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,154
have been pressing
for payment on your debt.

169
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,532
And you woke me
to tell me that?

170
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:34,245
A thousand apologies, Mr. Cunningham,
but they've also writ to His Lordship.

171
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,793
Damn it, man.

172
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,755
I but recently earned
His Lordship 200 guineas.

173
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,509
What are the complaints of a
few tradesmen for such services?

174
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,096
This country does
not agree with me.

175
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,349
I cannot wait to be
out of the damnable place.

176
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,437
The sentiments of
a great many of us, sir.

177
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,982
Would you like me to take
away your chamber pot?

178
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,319
I know many a Scotsman would be
glad of this on a cold morning.

179
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:11,157
It's almost pure spirit, and
I'm no judge of a pint of pish.

180
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,621
Come back.
Come here!

181
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,083
I killed Tam Sibbald
yesterday morning.

182
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,254
We played ball
once at Crieff market.

183
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:29,008
I remember shouting, "Well
done, Tam," when he made a run.

184
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,636
And there he was, hung on
the end of my dirk like meat.

185
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,804
Aye.

186
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,265
Well, likely
it was necessary.

187
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,435
Aye, it was. Necessary
enough to save worse.

188
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,355
But those tinkers weren't
all born broken men, Mary.

189
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,691
Some of them
had kin and clan.

190
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,737
They made me fear I might have come
across one of our own among them.

191
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,906
MacGregors are not tinkers.

192
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,493
But a hard winter or
two away, some of us...

193
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,246
What's gnawing on you,
Robert?

194
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,959
I've made up my mind to
borrow money from Montrose

195
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,046
to buy cattle at Crieff
market and sell at Carlisle.

196
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,797
How much money?

197
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,090
£1,000.

198
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:16,013
Believe me, Mary, it will turn profit.
£6 in Crieff is £12 in Carlisle.

199
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,473
And I know cattle.

200
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,517
I can drive them faster
and deliver them fatter

201
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,852
than any man
in the kingdom.

202
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,356
And why would the Marquis of
Montrose lend a MacGregor £1,000?

203
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,984
For profit, what else? It's an
investment as much as a loan.

204
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,780
So it's business partners you
are now, you and the Marquis.

205
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,407
Keep that tongue
for your boys, woman.

206
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,619
I didn't tell you my
mind to be flayed for it.

207
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:46,126
You know I love the bones
of you, Robert MacGregor.

208
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,088
But you take too much to
heart that cannot be helped.

209
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,839
It must be helped.

210
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,134
All right,

211
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,637
but not today.

212
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,647
I got yous.
I got the two of yous!

213
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,857
Got the two of yous!

214
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,153
Move on.

215
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,826
Father, will MacGregors
ever be kings again?

216
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,830
All men with honor
are kings,

217
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,833
but not all kings
have honor.

218
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,459
What is honor?

219
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,087
Honor is

220
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,385
what no man can give you,
and none can take away.

221
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,056
Honor is a man's gift
to himself.

222
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,267
Do women have it?

223
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,812
Women are
the heart of honor,

224
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,523
and we cherish and protect it in them.

225
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,402
You must never mistreat
a woman or malign a man,

226
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,696
nor stand by
and see another do so.

227
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,073
How do you know
if you have it?

228
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,328
Never worry on
the getting of it.

229
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,872
It grows in you
and speaks to you.

230
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,043
All you need do is listen.

231
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,797
All right, lads,
enough of the finer things.

232
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,758
You've animals to tend
to and water to haul.

233
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,384
Away with you.

234
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,804
Your mother and me
will be down directly.

235
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,932
Take the basket.

236
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,730
Come on! I'll race you down the hill.

237
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,111
Do you know how fine you
are to me, Mary MacGregor?

238
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,738
So fine.

239
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,371
Is that why
you sent them away?

240
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,290
To tell me
how fine I am?

241
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:57,299
Or did you want to make a silk
purse out of my sow's ear again?

242
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,428
What a wanton I'm wed to.

243
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,268
You know what the old wives
say about these standing stones?

244
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,770
No.

245
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,398
What do the old wives say,
old wife?

246
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,859
Come here.

247
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,861
What do they say?

248
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,955
So, what do they say?

249
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,293
They say the stones
make men hard,

250
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,005
and women fertile.

251
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,178
We've no need of them,
you and me.

252
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,240
You know how fine you are
to me, Robert MacGregor?

253
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,494
This tailor in Glasgow

254
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,746
to whom you owe £87

255
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,624
extended this credit
because you were my guest?

256
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:58,462
Or as you prefer to frame it,
"a member of my household"?

257
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,299
I can assure Your Lordship I
have in no manner indebted him.

258
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,468
And now Killearn
tells me

259
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,679
that you are saddling
one of my serving wenches.

260
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:13,602
Damn it, sir! Your mother did not send
you to me to debauch innocent girls.

261
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,772
I regret that I have
so offended Your Lordship.

262
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,399
By your leave,
I will remove myself.

263
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,573
And to where,
might I ask?

264
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,829
You are penniless.
You have no mount.

265
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,539
You know no one.

266
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,417
To where will you
remove yourself?

267
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,796
Have you some notion

268
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,424
of presenting yourself
at the Duke of Argyll's door,

269
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,719
and soliciting his patronage
as his new champion?

270
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,099
I am Your Lordship's
to command.

271
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,186
Remember your place, sir!

272
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,816
That's all I ask
of any man.

273
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,946
What is next?

274
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,073
MacGregor, my lord.

275
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,498
You may go, Archibald.

276
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,567
You bear no arms?

277
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,904
I hadn't planned on demanding
terms at sword point.

278
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,660
Robert MacGregor of
Craigrostan, my lord.

279
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,831
So, MacGregor,

280
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,502
I knew your father, an
able man, if not a wise one.

281
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,255
Have you taken on
his mantle?

282
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,215
As best I may,
my lord.

283
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,138
So, how many men
are you master of?

284
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,015
Master of none,
my lord,

285
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,560
but some 200 souls
live close by Craigrostan,

286
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,062
and are in my care.

287
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,105
But you are a prophet
and provider to them,

288
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,732
is that not so?

289
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,109
What I can, I do.

290
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,404
It is no great matter compared
to Your Lordship's world.

291
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,451
To know one's place, MacGregor,
in the order of things

292
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,328
is a great blessing.

293
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,540
And what terms, Killearn?
A fifth, my lord.

294
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,417
A fifth, you say?

295
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,920
What, is this man kin that
you offer such kindly terms?

296
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,714
Am I not accustomed to a
quarter on unsecured loans?

297
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,093
MacGregor has 300 acres
at Craigrostan, my lord.

298
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,517
A man of property
intent on growing richer.

299
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:03,397
Well, we have more in common than
I would have suspected, MacGregor.

300
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:09,736
£1,000 for three months, you say,
and these acres of yours as security?

301
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,072
And my oath.

302
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,825
Yes.

303
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,871
Tell me, is there something
in what Killearn says,

304
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,249
that you might have
driven off my cattle,

305
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:26,753
and returned them with stories of
tinkers caught and summarily executed?

306
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,507
I have, in my day, thieved
cattle, Your Lordship,

307
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,926
but none that were
under my watch.

308
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,096
Is that what passes for
honor with a MacGregor, then?

309
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,433
What passes for honor
with me

310
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,436
is likely enough the same
as with Your Lordship.

311
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,022
When my word is given,
it is good.

312
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,819
Well, you are to be congratulated
on such cheaply bought nobility.

313
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,492
Killearn will draw papers.

314
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,163
And I will expect
the terms to be met.

315
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,959
My thanks
to Your Lordship.

316
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,894
Aye, but it's a fine,
bold signature you have,

317
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,897
worthy of
a chieftain himself.

318
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,191
Are you Rob Roy MacGregor?

319
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,444
I am. And what's your
name? Davey Anderson.

320
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,946
Hello, Davey Anderson.
Hello.

321
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,326
Even the servant boys
know who you are.

322
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,121
You've become a famous reiver and
retriever in your own lifetime.

323
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,415
Business and profit.

324
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,250
And a soft winter.

325
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,336
Are you
Rob Roy MacGregor?

326
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,049
I am.

327
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,676
I'm Will Guthrie.

328
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,513
You heard of me?

329
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,848
No, I have not.

330
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,185
Well, I've heard of you.

331
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,479
Indeed.

332
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,357
And what have you heard, Mr. Guthrie?

333
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:14,694
I heard you backstabbed
Tam Sibbald.

334
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,910
Were you and Tam kin?

335
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,954
Near enough.

336
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,540
I shagged his sister.

337
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,376
Likely so did Tam.

338
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,088
You want the wind
let out of your bladder?

339
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,260
What's your business
with me, Guthrie?

340
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Business

341
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,101
best done outside.

342
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,321
We have no quarrel.

343
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,407
That can be remedied.

344
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,546
The first cut?

345
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,714
Aye.

346
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,345
Well done.

347
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,144
Some other time,

348
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,606
when we're both sober.

349
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,498
Tam Sibbald has a longer reach
dead than he ever did living.

350
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,708
I'm away home.

351
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,377
Keep the pony and stick to
Killearn till you have the note.

352
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,214
I'll see you back in Craigrostan. Aye.

353
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,015
I'm to wait here
till the note is signed.

354
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,851
Aye. We are
the obedient one.

355
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,646
Fetch and carry
at command.

356
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,023
Tell me, McDonald, why has
a smart young lad like you

357
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,525
attached himself to
such a bunch of tinkers?

358
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,611
I would have thought you more
fit to serve a man like my master,

359
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,737
the Marquis of Montrose.

360
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,698
I do not serve Robert
MacGregor, Killearn.

361
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:29,204
I'm his friend, and count
myself fortunate to claim it.

362
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:34,000
My God, what a crew
you Highlanders are.

363
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,336
With your airs and honors,

364
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,215
come begging £1,000 as if you
were doing the lender a favor.

365
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,009
Sheep shaggers,
the lot of you.

366
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:51,935
My mother could come no nearer than
three candidates for my paternity.

367
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,231
The Earl of Rutland.

368
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,025
Now, there's a name
for a whore master.

369
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,696
A secretary to
the Spanish Ambassador,

370
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,325
whose name she hazarded as Ferdinando.

371
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:14,291
And some young buck she never saw who
raised her skirts at a masked ball.

372
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,959
He ravished her?

373
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,921
I would put it no higher than surprised.

374
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,927
Archie, take me with you.

375
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,888
Wherever, whatever.

376
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,850
Take me away with you.

377
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:37,689
I am away, Betty, and God help
me, this is where I've landed.

378
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,816
You think me a gentleman

379
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,736
because I have linen
and can manage a lisp.

380
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,865
I am but a bastard abroad,

381
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:52,495
seeking my fortune
and the favors of great men,

382
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,751
as big a whore as
my mother ever was.

383
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,255
I'm pregnant by you,
Archie.

384
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,428
Well.

385
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:18,021
When it asks for its father's name,
at least you'll have it to give.

386
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,275
Mr. Cunningham,
it's me, Killearn.

387
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,653
A word with you.
Don't let him see me.

388
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,915
You are a carbuncle on this
arse of a country, Killearn.

389
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,250
And if you ever inform against
me to His Lordship again,

390
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,629
I'll squeeze the pus out
of you with my bare hands.

391
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:50,553
My, Archie, but you have
a rare contempt in you.

392
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,973
I gave you no leave
to call me familiar.

393
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,894
Could I pay
for the privilege?

394
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,646
At a fair price.

395
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,189
What are you
gibbering about?

396
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,983
Money, Archie.
Money. What else?

397
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,445
How much money?

398
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:14,035
Let's talk inside
over a dram.

399
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,121
It's chill on the stairs.

400
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:21,584
Say what you have to say.
I am engaged within.

401
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,837
You've Betty
on her back.

402
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,673
How much money?

403
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,008
£1,000.

404
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,887
£1,000. What does
£1,000 look like?

405
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,265
Will we have enough
ponies to carry it?

406
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,683
Not coin.

407
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,144
A note of credit drawn
on His Lordship.

408
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,146
At what interest, Rob?
One fifth.

409
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,940
And he gets £200 profit
for three months?

410
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,276
Aye. That's
the price of cash,

411
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,362
and we must plan the
matter to the last penny.

412
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:53,450
When Alan returns, he'll take three
of you, and you'll go to Crieff.

413
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,326
There you'll bargain
with the drovers,

414
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,079
and have the herd assembled when
I come with a kit for the drive.

415
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,747
How many, Rob?
How big a herd?

416
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,458
300, maybe more.

417
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,960
And whatever we can
acquire along the way.

418
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,254
No harm if a dozen
or more stick.

419
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,673
We'll drive them into
Carlisle like an army.

420
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,009
So let's have
all hands to it.

421
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,762
And we'll stay warm this
winter, within and without.

422
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,641
And to celebrate, we'll hold a
gathering and drink to our success!

423
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:28,151
Right, McKinness. That's
two shillings still owed.

424
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,949
Next.
Colqhoun.

425
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,410
Colqhoun, what have
you got? A rabbit?

426
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,661
Aye, a rabbit.

427
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,706
Well, you're still
a week behind, Colqhoun.

428
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,632
Must I wait all day
for my note, Killearn?

429
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,761
Patience, MacGregor's man.
Your turn is marked.

430
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,388
Take you that goat
to the pen.

431
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,100
Come, young Davey Wilson.
What have you got for me?

432
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,852
A rabbit.
Another rabbit.

433
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,397
Does nobody have any money?
No, sir. Only a rabbit.

434
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,462
Dreaming of the New World,
were we?

435
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:39,138
I hear tell in the New World
they have tribes of noble savages

436
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,600
with paint on their faces
and skins on their backs.

437
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,354
You'll be well at home
among them.

438
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,148
Enough of this tripe.
Have you the note?

439
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,986
His Lordship is to
Edinburgh for the assize,

440
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,029
then to London direct.

441
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,906
Great doings at the court.

442
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,076
And he's away without signing the note.

443
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,579
The best I can do
for you is coin.

444
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,542
This was not agreed.

445
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,920
Agreed or no, there's £1,000
here. Take it or leave it,

446
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,090
it makes no difference to me,
nor to His Grace.

447
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,345
Aye, it's a terrible shock,

448
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,724
the sight of such a fortune
within reach, is it not?

449
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,102
It's just as well you have
the trust of the MacGregor,

450
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,188
or I'd be hard pressed
to sign it over to you.

451
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,299
Angus.
It's a great gathering, Rob!

452
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,770
That Alasdair Roy
is a fierce dancer.

453
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:54,107
The last time I saw you in such a
lather, you were flat on your back.

454
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,694
Do not affront me
afore these folk.

455
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:01,489
Rob, do you know why Calvinists
are against shagging standing up?

456
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,949
No, Coll. I do not.

457
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,535
They fear it might
lead to dancing.

458
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:15,313
Stay back, or by God,
I'll shoot you dead.

459
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,106
For a moment there,

460
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,651
I thought you might take the
road to Greenock with your £1,000.

461
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,491
Killing is not so easy
as it seems.

462
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,232
He sat out there all day,
pondering on this.

463
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,651
You gave him coin.

464
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,069
He insisted upon it.

465
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,113
When I told him His Grace
had not signed the note,

466
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,281
he said you must have it,

467
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,533
or the beasts could not
be bought at the best price.

468
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,785
I'm hard put to see you
hand over such a sum

469
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,079
on the demand of one who
couldn't bear the debt.

470
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,748
He was your man,

471
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:47,835
present at your signing of the
terms, ordered by you to wait.

472
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:50,337
For a note, not a bag of guineas!

473
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,718
It was not all guineas.

474
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,597
These farmers pay in
small coin, I assure you.

475
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,974
He signed for this
bag of coin?

476
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,517
Indeed.

477
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,145
He did.

478
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,321
Almost as bold
a hand as yourself.

479
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,870
And best be no
skullduggery here, Killearn.

480
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,414
Alan McDonald stands
under my protection.

481
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,375
Well, that's a great comfort
to us all, I must say,

482
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,503
what with
£1,000 at risk.

483
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,519
Now, listen.
We must search for Alan.

484
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,395
I fear he's come
to mischief hereabouts.

485
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,190
I say we look for him
in Greenock, Rob.

486
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,945
It comes quickly to your mind
that he has robbed us, Alasdair.

487
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,864
He spoke of the Americas often enough.

488
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,116
And what?

489
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,411
He walked to Greenock from Buchlyvie,
and sent his pony home without him?

490
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,790
£1,000 would be enough
to buy him 10 ponies.

491
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,126
Alan McDonald
did not betray me.

492
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,461
Now to it,
and find his trace.

493
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,381
Come on! To it!

494
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,678
Go to Greenock, then, since you
have that stink in your nose.

495
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,263
But, Brother,

496
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,767
bad enough that it might be
so without you wishing it.

497
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,501
Well, what news?

498
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,131
The ship sailed the
day before I got there,

499
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,718
and McDonald's name was not
on the harbormaster's list.

500
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,849
But he wouldn't have
likely used his own name

501
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,810
and him run off
with 1,000...

502
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,107
Aye.

503
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:48,057
Your Lordship, the Duke
of Argyll this way comes.

504
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:55,898
John, you look like a man
who means to play hard.

505
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:59,360
Do not presume to speak
above your station, sir!

506
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,654
I will have
my rank from you!

507
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,741
Your Grace.

508
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,076
I have word from court

509
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,578
that you are putting
my name about as a Jacobite,

510
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:14,333
as one who would rise for the Stuart
should he land here to claim the throne.

511
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,880
Great men such as yourself draw
rumors as shite draws flies.

512
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:23,300
You are the shite, Montrose,
and the flies upon it!

513
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:28,264
For all the flowers in your great
gardens, I know you in my nose.

514
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,892
Keep your stink off my name,

515
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:36,105
or by God, I will clip you as
close as one of your gelded trees,

516
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:39,525
and this carrion you keep
will not come between us!

517
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:48,200
What pride to use a
fellow peer in public so!

518
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,452
Damn his pride!

519
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,708
Forgive me.

520
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,586
Damn His Grace's pride.

521
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,855
Why is it so beyond
your belief

522
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:21,984
that he might have yielded to the sight
of all that money put into his hand?

523
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:26,155
Unguarded, unasked, but there,
a lifetime's wages in a bag.

524
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,074
Because I know him. I know
him more than half his life.

525
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,201
But was he ever
handed £1,000 before?

526
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:36,040
He was handed a hundred times more. He
was given trust, and he repaid in kind.

527
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,917
Why do you not believe me?

528
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,755
All right, Rob. He
did not steal from you.

529
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,716
But he has gone,
and the money's gone,

530
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,886
and Montrose will not care if you
believe one thing or the other.

531
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,765
That's another matter. No.
That is the only matter now.

532
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,850
For all our sakes, Robert,

533
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:58,520
you must take off your high
hat and make what terms you can,

534
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:02,358
else our home is lost, and
ourselves His Lordship's tenants.

535
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,730
Here comes
the bold Highlander.

536
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:45,359
No arse in his breeks, but
too proud to tug his forelock.

537
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,196
No doubt the rogue seeks
to blame his servant,

538
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,949
for I hear there is
no word of the man.

539
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,453
I see you're back in favor
with your tailor, Archibald.

540
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,455
He must be a happy man.

541
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,667
So, MacGregor,
how is it with you?

542
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,835
As it was, my lord.

543
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,046
There is still no word of
McDonald or Your Lordship's money.

544
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,756
What are we to do, then?

545
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,051
If Your Lordship would contract
with me for another sum,

546
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,554
I would turn over all profit
and so repay my debt.

547
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:17,099
I have but lost £1,000.
You ask me to risk another?

548
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:20,102
My lord, the money was
stolen from me and from you.

549
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:22,938
I am no part of your
incompetence, MacGregor.

550
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,732
You signed a paper.
And I will honor it.

551
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,902
Ply me not with
your honor, man.

552
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,031
Let us keep
these matters simple.

553
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,492
You are indebted to me.
On that we are agreed?

554
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,202
We are, my lord.

555
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,456
Know you the Duke of Argyll?

556
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,375
By his repute alone.

557
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:48,589
My report is that
Argyll is a Jacobite,

558
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:52,301
and would declare for James Stuart
should he seek to reclaim the throne.

559
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,137
These are intelligences
unknown to me, my lord.

560
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,222
They are known to you now.

561
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,557
I'm uncertain of
Your Lordship's meaning.

562
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,101
Damn it, man!

563
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:04,396
You and your clan are
Jacobites, bred to the bone.

564
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,150
Argyll is nothing to you.

565
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,653
I want your word
against him.

566
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:15,616
Give it, and we will come to
some reckoning on what you owe me.

567
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:23,790
I can be of no assistance to Your Lordship
in this matter of the Duke of Argyll.

568
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,125
You owe me.

569
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,419
I owe you money.
Nothing more.

570
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:32,633
What you have asked is as below me
as it should be beneath Your Lordship.

571
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,886
You misspeak yourself,
MacGregor.

572
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,222
It is the Marquis of Montrose
who has misspoke himself,

573
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,557
to ask my perjury
against his enemies.

574
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,852
Leave the blade be, sir!
This is not your quarrel.

575
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:48,065
You do not hear me, MacGregor.
I did not ask if or whether.

576
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,444
Your land is forfeit to me
against your debt.

577
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:56,031
Until that is settled, I will
have you lodged in the tollbooth.

578
00:58:56,115 --> 00:59:00,077
Take him into custody, Archibald.
You have my commission on it!

579
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,959
My father spent
two years in that jail

580
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,419
for no cause but the will
of great men like you.

581
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,879
And I will not
go there, sir.

582
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,130
Call out the watch,
damn you!

583
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,800
Call nothing,
or I'll cut his throat!

584
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,888
You are damned,
MacGregor. Damned to hell.

585
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:23,392
Come, Your Lordship.
Leave the devil some work.

586
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,769
You've done enough
for one day.

587
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,355
Well, call out the watch!

588
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,439
Yes, sir.

589
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,649
Call out the watch!

590
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,068
Do you hear me?
Call out the watch!

591
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:36,488
You have slept your last
peaceful night, MacGregor,

592
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,491
you and yours.

593
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,915
What is John Campbell,
Duke of Argyll, to us, Robert,

594
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,543
that you must defend him
against Montrose?

595
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,877
I did not defend him.

596
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,839
I refused to bear
false witness against him.

597
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:58,385
Gregor, send men to the
passes and set watches.

598
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,428
And the lochside?

599
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:03,390
They'll not likely come along
by the shore, but watch all ways.

600
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,768
Now, listen, lads. I have to
go to the hills for a time.

601
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:10,022
You stay by your mother
and be her help, you hear?

602
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:16,570
Let Argyll know that you
are persecuted for his sake.

603
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:19,865
I'm persecuted for no
man's sake but my own, Mary.

604
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:23,952
What?

605
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,747
Would you have me lie against
my conscience to suit Montrose?

606
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:30,125
No! To suit me
and Duncan and Ranald,

607
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:35,255
to stay home with your wife and children
instead of taking to the hills like a fox.

608
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,216
Out!

609
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,136
Out! Out! Out!

610
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,430
He'll be with you
soon enough!

611
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:56,151
Take the boys and go to
Morag's. She'll make a place.

612
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,488
And let Montrose's
troopers foul my house?

613
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:02,824
No harm will come to you.
Montrose's quarrel is with me.

614
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:07,537
And you revel in it.
The great man against all.

615
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:14,920
And likely you'll slip down in
the night when the mood takes you.

616
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:19,174
Or will you just find yourself
a sheep to comfort you?

617
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:23,261
Aye, well, if I do, it will be
one that doesn't bleat so bitter.

618
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,683
No trouble between them
and you. Give no cause.

619
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,059
This is between me
and Montrose,

620
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:32,521
and likely when he's broke a
few horses, he'll quieten down.

621
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:35,732
Watch Alasdair. Put him
where he can do no harm.

622
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,693
Keep up the watch
for McDonald.

623
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,486
Rob, he's long gone.

624
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,406
Aye, but is he over
the seas or under them?

625
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,741
And, Coll,

626
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:49,454
ask Morag to go down to Mary.
She's sore at me for this business.

627
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:53,959
That Montrose is a stoat of a man.
Heaven protect us from his like.

628
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,669
When the king comes
across the water again,

629
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,462
we'll see him hung.

630
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:24,489
Your Lordship will not regret
leaving this matter in my hands.

631
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,617
I have some knowledge of how
best to bring such rogues to heel.

632
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:32,038
Broken but not dead,
Archibald. That is all I ask.

633
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,999
"Broken but not dead. "

634
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,710
It has a ring to it.

635
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,005
Your health.

636
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:19,920
Goodbye!

637
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,801
Instead of spying them out,
we should lay for them,

638
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,094
and cut them down as they
come through the passes.

639
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,972
Aye, a wee war with
Montrose would suit us fine.

640
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,891
Listen, Alasdair Roy.

641
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,353
Keep your watch, give
warning, and stay your hand,

642
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:38,396
or you'll answer to me.

643
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:47,322
Damn that McDonald
has brought this on us.

644
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:50,992
I never trusted the man. Always
at Rob's arse like a collie dog.

645
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,579
Morag had a dream
on him. Saw him drowned.

646
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:59,626
Maybe his ship sank, and him
loaded down with the theft.

647
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,073
Give me your musket.

648
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,672
Boys, wake up! Wake up!
Quickly! Quickly!

649
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:51,840
Get out of bed!

650
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:56,511
Go, go!
Bring the Gregorach!

651
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,093
I've come for the outlaw
Robert MacGregor.

652
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:40,305
If you think he'd be lying
in his bed waiting for you,

653
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,932
you're more of a fool
than you look.

654
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,525
Search the outsheds.
Burn them.

655
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,152
Kill the stock.

656
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:57,197
You best stand aside,
Mistress MacGregor.

657
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,408
You don't ask a whore.
You make her.

658
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:26,351
No!

659
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,710
Do you want yours now,
Killearn?

660
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:37,172
Now that I've loosened her
up for you.

661
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:47,599
Think of yourself
as the scabbard

662
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:50,810
and me the sword,
Mistress MacGregor.

663
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,021
And a fine fit
you were, too.

664
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:58,985
I will think of you dead
until my husband makes you so.

665
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:04,115
And then I will think
on you no more.

666
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:07,410
Indeed.

667
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,079
Such a man as he will need
to see blood on his blade

668
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,498
before honor is satisfied.

669
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:20,465
Tell him Archibald Cunningham
is at his service.

670
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:46,824
What are you gawking at? Have
you never been to war before?

671
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:52,038
You're a warrior, Archie,
and no mistake.

672
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:21,234
If she doesn't come out, Archie,
there will be a reckoning.

673
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:24,529
Shagging her's one thing,
burning her's another.

674
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:29,951
She'll be out. She's a
hater, that one. There she is.

675
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,184
Back to the boat!

676
01:12:03,777 --> 01:12:07,363
They say it's not a sin if
you don't take pleasure in it.

677
01:12:57,456 --> 01:13:01,376
Come on!

678
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:04,504
Come on!
Come on!

679
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,758
I am Alasdair
Roy MacGregor!

680
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:11,803
Come on! Come on!

681
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,807
Is that the best
you can do?

682
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,649
Do it again,
bastards!

683
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:27,819
Come on!

684
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:33,658
Come on! Come on! Come...

685
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:54,846
Mary, are you hurt?
Did they wound you?

686
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:07,108
Mary.

687
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,071
What have they done?

688
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,035
We will avenge you.

689
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,747
Rob will kill every
last one of them.

690
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:26,627
He will not know.
Rob will not know.

691
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:28,963
Mary, Rob must know.

692
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:32,467
He will not!
He will not know!

693
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,218
He will not!

694
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,722
I will not tell him,
and you will not.

695
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:39,432
Do you hear me,
Alasdair MacGregor?

696
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:42,143
But, Mary, no.
It is what they want!

697
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,397
It is what the Englishman
wants! It is his plan!

698
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:50,943
You swear it to me.
Swear it!

699
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:53,571
I cannot! I cannot! Swear it! Swear it!

700
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:54,739
You can!

701
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:59,327
If I can bear it to be done,
you can bear to be silent!

702
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,704
Now, you swear it!
Swear it.

703
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:04,165
Swear it. Swear it.

704
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:07,710
Swear it! Swear it!
I swear. I swear. I swear.

705
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:18,721
And I will hold you to it.

706
01:15:20,098 --> 01:15:21,516
Mark me.

707
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:45,665
But of MacGregor himself,
still no word?

708
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:47,500
We will have him
soon enough.

709
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:50,211
I have set such an affront
to his Highland honor,

710
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,213
that he will come
to redeem it.

711
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,715
Very well.

712
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,470
See to it that I am not
mocked, and in the meanwhile,

713
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:03,849
make my claim against these acres
in Lomondside for the debt he owes.

714
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:09,981
Still no word of this
man of MacGregor's?

715
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,525
He who took the coin?

716
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,570
No, my lord, not a word.

717
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:16,862
Nor will there be.

718
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:20,074
This was a ploy of MacGregor's, to
take the money and blame another.

719
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:23,494
His man is well hid, and Your
Lordship's money well spent.

720
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:25,538
I wager it.

721
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:32,461
You have a rare grasp of the
conspirator's mind, Archibald.

722
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:35,006
You're to be
commended on it.

723
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:51,606
He sees through it, Archie.
I know him and his gibes.

724
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,066
And you think it would
count against us if he knew?

725
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:56,527
He has another 300 acres
to plant and prune.

726
01:16:56,612 --> 01:17:00,615
And all for the price of a
paltry 1,000 Scotch pounds.

727
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:03,409
A fair price by any
reckoning. Archie, sir!

728
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,953
I must speak with you.

729
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:14,837
I am dismissed from service
on account of my state.

730
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,797
And what is your state,
pretty Betty?

731
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:19,133
You know well.
I'm with your child.

732
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:22,219
And he, this one,
has made report of it.

733
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:25,931
Betty, my report did nothing your
belly wouldn't announce on its own.

734
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:31,228
Archie, what am I to do?

735
01:17:31,938 --> 01:17:33,189
Root it out.

736
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:36,817
If Killearn here does not know an
old crone with a twig I miss my guess.

737
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:38,611
It's gone
too far for that.

738
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:42,406
Then it will not be the first
bastard born in Scotland.

739
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:44,784
Archie, I love you.

740
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:47,828
Love is a dunghill,
Betty,

741
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:50,373
and I am but a cock that
climbs upon it to crow.

742
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,417
No!

743
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,491
It's a sore thing they have
done to us, Mary and me.

744
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:30,204
Far past any wrong I had expected,
even from such as Montrose.

745
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:33,207
He must pay for it, Rob!

746
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:35,126
Else what are we?

747
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:38,713
Pay he will till
his teeth squeal.

748
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,216
Think on it, now.
Think on it.

749
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:47,638
Even if we raised all the
MacGregors, we could not, must not,

750
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,473
fight Montrose
in open battle.

751
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:54,520
He has 10, 20 times our numbers and
the strength of the Crown to back him.

752
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:57,565
There is honor here.

753
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:00,568
You were wronged.
Mary is wronged.

754
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:04,655
Honor will be satisfied.
You know me well enough.

755
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:07,491
But consider this.

756
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:11,203
One house burned,

757
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:13,247
cattle killed,

758
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,708
but none are dead,
none injured.

759
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,716
Rob is right.

760
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:26,135
Rob is right!

761
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:30,139
It is not within our reach
to harm such as Montrose.

762
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,602
Wheesht! Wheesht! Wheesht!

763
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:38,022
Wheesht! Wheesht!

764
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,649
I will harm him.
Never fear.

765
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:42,443
Aye!
Aye!

766
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:46,739
The tenderest part of
the Marquis is his purse.

767
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:49,950
We'll hurt him there.

768
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,370
Thieve his cattle.
Steal his rent.

769
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,833
Rent and cattle,
until his coffers are bled.

770
01:19:58,168 --> 01:19:59,877
Aye!
Aye!

771
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:03,214
Wait! Wait!

772
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:08,677
Wheesht!
Wheesht! Morag.

773
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,680
We have not heard
Mary on it,

774
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:14,725
and in truth, she was
the one most affronted.

775
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:25,069
Rob is right. What cannot
be helped must be endured.

776
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,987
It will look more like
itself when the sun shines.

777
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:10,030
Eh, lads? Yeah.

778
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,454
When we have our bed in it
and us in our bed,

779
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,540
it will seem home enough.

780
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:26,797
All right, play can wait.
We have work to do.

781
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,633
Duncan.

782
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:51,614
I should have been
with you, Mary.

783
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,658
It wasn't right that
I was in the hills.

784
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:56,911
Then you would
be dead now.

785
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:59,914
No. They would have
taken me to the tollbooth.

786
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:04,251
No. I think you
would be dead.

787
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,932
I could not hear
all of it,

788
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:20,935
but Killearn talked of money
that Archie might take.

789
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:23,354
This is Cunningham,
this Archie?

790
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:27,358
He is wild,
but it's not him.

791
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:31,320
It's that Killearn.
He has the devil in him.

792
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:35,324
Tell me about this money.
Did you hear a sum spoken?

793
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:39,745
Archie said it would be the
easiest £1,000 he'd ever earned.

794
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:43,707
The only pity that it would be
in Scots and not English pounds.

795
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:46,251
How did he mean
to earn this £1,000?

796
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:48,462
I know not.

797
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:51,590
Save that Killearn said
no trace must be left.

798
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:57,262
My husband will appreciate
that you came with this word.

799
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:02,393
Will you take some supper and
rest, Betty? For you look ill-used.

800
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:05,771
I'm no worse used than I
deserve, Mistress MacGregor.

801
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:07,773
For I have a bastard's
bastard in me.

802
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:10,567
And no home for him
when he comes out.

803
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:14,780
Well, we better feed you, or he
won't have the strength to try it.

804
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:20,035
Lass, lass, lass.

805
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,496
Bear up now.

806
01:23:23,623 --> 01:23:26,792
Your bairn will have you,
and you will have it.

807
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:29,378
But I will not
have Archie.

808
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:32,881
Mistress MacGregor,
I love him,

809
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:35,968
even after all.

810
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:39,638
Is that not a worse sin than any other?

811
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:46,270
No, Betty.

812
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:51,483
Love is never a sin,
only the lack of it.

813
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:54,862
I knew it. I knew
they plotted against us.

814
01:23:54,946 --> 01:23:57,531
Damn them that
they carried it through.

815
01:23:57,615 --> 01:23:59,199
I will have them
before the assize.

816
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:02,161
Killearn and Cunningham. Aye, and
Montrose, too, if he were part of it.

817
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:04,455
You think such men
as these will admit this,

818
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:08,250
because wee Betty Sturrock, with
her belly under her chin, says so?

819
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:09,668
What's her belly
to do with it?

820
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:11,587
She's carrying
the Englishman's child.

821
01:24:11,671 --> 01:24:13,630
They'll call her a
whore come for revenge.

822
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:16,633
Now, they can say what they
like. She'll speak the truth.

823
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:20,554
Robert, to these men, the
truth is but a lie undiscovered.

824
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:22,389
I will have justice!

825
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:24,433
Alan McDonald is dead,
woman.

826
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:26,602
Then take your case
to the Duke of Argyll.

827
01:24:26,686 --> 01:24:29,063
It's known he bears
Montrose no favor.

828
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:31,565
You hold great store
by wolves of different shades.

829
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:32,775
They're all alike at lambing.

830
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:35,778
And you will have nothing
but your own way!

831
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:39,156
I tell you, Killearn and
Cunningham will not be condemned

832
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,033
before any assize
on Betty's word.

833
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:45,287
Aye. But I know one
that will condemn them.

834
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:49,500
And I'll have them before it,
or I'm not Robert MacGregor.

835
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,595
The Englishman will
never find him.

836
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,347
MacGregor knows
every rock and track,

837
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:06,058
and can walk faster
than the troopers can ride.

838
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:08,602
Look, put me
onto His Lordship

839
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:11,271
as a man that knows
the highways and byways.

840
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:18,403
I'll find him.
I swear it.

841
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:38,715
On your feet, Killearn.
You and I have business.

842
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:44,012
Now is your moment, Guthrie. It
would stand well with His Lordship.

843
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:46,223
This is not your fight,
Guthrie.

844
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:53,021
And if I make it
my fight?

845
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:56,733
Then give Tam Sibbald my
regards when you see him.

846
01:25:56,901 --> 01:26:00,154
Fight him well and you'll
win His Lordship's favor.

847
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:01,697
I warrant it.

848
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:46,950
Please, please, please don't kill
me. Don't kill me. It wasn't me.

849
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,285
Outside.

850
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:54,333
It's him the lass
wants revenge on. Cunningham.

851
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:58,295
And I grant it,
he treated her sore.

852
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:04,718
If you harm me, His
Lordship will hunt you down,

853
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:05,969
and you know it.

854
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:10,807
I'm past caring, Killearn.

855
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:25,197
The lantern.

856
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:37,501
Go back, get Betty, and we'll
try him before morning. Now.

857
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:51,348
Inside.

858
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,039
Mary! Mary!

859
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:17,666
Who is it?
It's Alasdair.

860
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:23,547
Rob's holding Killearn, and he
wants to see Betty straightaway.

861
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:25,590
I'll wake her.

862
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:30,137
Treat her gentle. She's
near the end of her tether.

863
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:36,226
Where's my father?

864
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:39,730
Wheesht.

865
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:46,445
Are the soldiers coming?

866
01:28:46,529 --> 01:28:48,447
You two should be sleeping.

867
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:50,449
No!

868
01:28:50,533 --> 01:28:51,700
Stay there!

869
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:03,920
Get my knife!

870
01:29:55,681 --> 01:29:57,974
Mary? Where's the girl?

871
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,436
Betty Sturrock hanged
herself in our shed.

872
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:05,816
She made me bring her. I
told... I made him bring me

873
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,568
for I have dealings
with this Killearn.

874
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:11,154
Me and Betty Sturrock
and Betty Sturrock's child,

875
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,698
the three of us will
bring it out of him.

876
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:16,159
No. This is no
matter for him.

877
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:18,620
This is between us.

878
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:23,625
As I am your wife, Robert, I
will have my way in this, I will.

879
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:40,725
Betty! Is that you?

880
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:42,811
Betty is dead.

881
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:47,899
She killed herself this
night, and her unborn with her.

882
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,319
Mistress MacGregor.

883
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,657
So the poor girl is dead.

884
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:59,119
Spare me your hypocrisy,
Killearn.

885
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:03,415
You are as much her murderer
as she, you and that Englishman.

886
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,876
I had no part
in her child

887
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:09,379
any more than that
matter at Craigrostan.

888
01:31:10,756 --> 01:31:15,177
You stood and gloated.
You did all with your eyes.

889
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:19,055
You have not told him.

890
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:22,934
You think me such a puppet that
I would put my husband's head

891
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:25,729
in a noose fashioned
from my own dishonor?

892
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:30,192
You have a proposal
for me. I can tell.

893
01:31:30,776 --> 01:31:35,280
You will sign your name to a statement
telling how you slew Alan McDonald,

894
01:31:35,364 --> 01:31:38,492
stole my husband's money,
burned our property.

895
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:40,535
Before a judge
you will sign it.

896
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:43,747
And let them hang me in the
tollbooth for my trouble?

897
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:47,000
No great inducement,
Mistress MacGregor.

898
01:31:47,084 --> 01:31:50,045
When it is signed,
you may go where you will.

899
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:52,172
Where you can.

900
01:31:54,717 --> 01:31:58,053
I shall not soon
forget, Mary,

901
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:01,056
the last time I saw you.

902
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:06,436
How nobly you walked from
that burning, like a queen.

903
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:11,525
You will sign it or else.
Or else what?

904
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,195
You'll tell Rob how Cunningham used you?

905
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:20,033
I have another picture,
not so noble,

906
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:25,956
of you stood in Lomond water,
washing between your legs.

907
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:31,044
I've wondered many a time
since that morning,

908
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:34,339
did you wash Archie out of
you, or is he still in there,

909
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:36,299
growing into his father?

910
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:45,976
Yes.

911
01:32:47,853 --> 01:32:51,064
Well, I have a proposal
for you, Mistress MacGregor.

912
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:54,734
Persuade your man that
Cunningham alone killed his man

913
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:58,363
and kept the money entirely,
and I will not speak

914
01:32:58,447 --> 01:33:02,450
of what you have
inside you.

915
01:33:06,872 --> 01:33:10,792
Rob would be hard pressed to
love such a bastard, would he not?

916
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:14,838
But you know
the saying, Mary.

917
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:17,632
'Tis a wise father
knows his own child.

918
01:33:17,883 --> 01:33:21,136
And if you'll not say
anything, neither will I.

919
01:33:27,643 --> 01:33:30,186
You have my word on it.

920
01:33:42,908 --> 01:33:44,618
Cut me...

921
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:51,708
She cut me.
The bitch cut me!

922
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:57,547
Mary, are you hurt?
Are you hurt?

923
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,098
What have you done, woman?

924
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,443
Am I cut bad?
Am I cut bad?

925
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:24,324
Not bad enough for me.

926
01:34:34,126 --> 01:34:36,419
I mean, my God, what
made you do such a thing?

927
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:40,090
I have as much cause
as you in this. More.

928
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:41,675
He has to be
made to confess.

929
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:43,134
He will never confess.

930
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:45,512
Betty was right.
He has the devil in him.

931
01:34:45,596 --> 01:34:48,807
Devil or no, he's my
prisoner. Don't you understand?

932
01:34:52,311 --> 01:34:56,356
Robert, there are things
you must know.

933
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:59,818
Things I have to tell you.

934
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:02,946
So? Tell me.

935
01:35:05,616 --> 01:35:06,783
There was...

936
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:10,995
Well?

937
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:14,791
He's dead, Rob.
I could do nothing.

938
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:21,214
Robert, listen to me now.

939
01:35:21,298 --> 01:35:23,383
There's no time
for talk now.

940
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:25,802
Alasdair,
can you sink a man?

941
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:27,721
Aye.
Cut the wind out of him,

942
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:30,056
put a rock in his belly,
take him out where it's deep.

943
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:32,517
Montrose will scour us
out now for sure.

944
01:35:32,601 --> 01:35:35,812
We must make sure you and the
lads are safe before he comes.

945
01:35:37,481 --> 01:35:38,565
Deep, mind you!

946
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:44,320
I am mocked by this rogue who
you took to deliver me broken.

947
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:48,742
'Tis myself who will be
broken if these raids go on.

948
01:35:49,952 --> 01:35:53,830
Now my factor is abducted in plain view.

949
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,541
Am I gone mad?

950
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:58,877
Your Lordship...
Do not...

951
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:01,880
Do not, I say,
speak in my stead.

952
01:36:06,635 --> 01:36:10,054
There's something here
that I do not see.

953
01:36:12,808 --> 01:36:14,934
Killearn and you have
some hand in matters

954
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:16,853
that is hid from sight.

955
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:26,112
This tells me that you are in cash,
yet I know you are without means.

956
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:30,116
Gaming, Your Lordship.
The cards favored.

957
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:35,872
Do you take me
entirely for a Whig, sir?

958
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:49,969
I care not what you and that
greasy capon have cooked up,

959
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:52,639
but put an end to this
impudence against me.

960
01:36:52,723 --> 01:36:55,767
I am James Graham,
Marquis of Montrose.

961
01:36:55,851 --> 01:36:58,061
And I will not be mocked.

962
01:36:59,396 --> 01:37:01,439
You hear me?

963
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:07,904
On the roof!
On the roof with it!

964
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:11,783
Take it from the back!

965
01:37:24,129 --> 01:37:26,714
We can't let them burn,
loot, and ride away.

966
01:37:29,426 --> 01:37:32,595
We should hit them, Rob.
Cunningham is there.

967
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,431
He's the one that took...
I know who he is.

968
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,017
Have you no thought
to avenge Mary for that?

969
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:40,937
There's 30 or more men.
They'd ride us down like sheep.

970
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:43,231
Alasdair MacGregor
is no sheep.

971
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:46,234
Coll's right.
We can do nothing.

972
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:06,504
Company, make ready!

973
01:38:11,802 --> 01:38:13,845
Attention, men!

974
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:22,770
Damn the wee fool! Scatter! Into
the mist. Find your own way home!

975
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:33,948
There they are!

976
01:38:34,658 --> 01:38:36,159
After him!

977
01:38:36,493 --> 01:38:37,911
I want MacGregor!

978
01:38:38,495 --> 01:38:40,496
Fire, you fools! Fire!

979
01:38:44,209 --> 01:38:45,585
I hit one of them.

980
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:47,420
And it will cost us,
I'm thinking.

981
01:38:49,506 --> 01:38:51,591
Move! Move!

982
01:38:55,054 --> 01:38:57,764
God's curse on you
for a brother, Alasdair.

983
01:38:57,973 --> 01:38:59,599
I want MacGregor!

984
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:05,271
You're getting too old
for the wars, Rob, eh?

985
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:27,543
Come on!

986
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:34,509
Fire! Fire,
you fools! Fire!

987
01:39:34,593 --> 01:39:36,761
Put me down. I can run. Shut your mouth.

988
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:41,683
Run, Rob, run!

989
01:39:41,892 --> 01:39:44,811
Go on, Rob!
Run for yourself!

990
01:40:11,755 --> 01:40:15,883
I want MacGregor!
I want MacGregor! After him!

991
01:40:22,099 --> 01:40:23,099
Be quiet!

992
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:47,790
Hold still.
Hold still.

993
01:40:52,379 --> 01:40:54,422
Knocked the breath
out of me.

994
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:58,509
Rob, I can't feel my legs.

995
01:40:59,678 --> 01:41:00,970
Are they there?

996
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:04,724
Aye, aye.
Your legs are fine.

997
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,980
Forgive me, Rob, for
I can't forgive myself.

998
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:13,024
Save your breath, lad.

999
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:17,987
I couldn't have
saved her, Rob.

1000
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:22,533
They were done with Mary
before I reached them.

1001
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:24,869
She made me swear
not to tell you.

1002
01:41:25,662 --> 01:41:26,871
I'm sorry.

1003
01:41:26,955 --> 01:41:29,791
Done what with Mary?
Done what?

1004
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:31,626
She said...

1005
01:41:32,586 --> 01:41:35,505
She said if
she could bear it...

1006
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:41,177
What of Mary, Alasdair?
Rob, I can't see.

1007
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:44,972
I'm here, Alasdair.
What of Mary? What of it?

1008
01:41:46,391 --> 01:41:48,017
They...

1009
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:51,437
They violated her.

1010
01:42:03,367 --> 01:42:06,035
Alasdair, who did this?

1011
01:42:06,787 --> 01:42:09,372
The mist is clearing.
Be ready.

1012
01:42:15,003 --> 01:42:16,462
Be ready
to search upwards!

1013
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:18,256
You men,
search upwards!

1014
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:48,119
There was a shot
on the ledge.

1015
01:42:59,089 --> 01:43:00,756
Forward!

1016
01:43:05,929 --> 01:43:07,889
Where is he?
Over there!

1017
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:12,560
Get the horse!

1018
01:43:38,754 --> 01:43:43,007
Well, well. The great
MacGregor come to hand at last.

1019
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:37,228
Well, how does it seem
to you tonight, MacGregor?

1020
01:44:41,191 --> 01:44:43,985
Is God's great plan for
us all to your liking?

1021
01:44:46,738 --> 01:44:49,907
"Broken but not dead"
was His Lordship's request.

1022
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:52,201
Well, I will do my part
if you will do yours

1023
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:55,162
and not die before
the bridge at Glen Orchy.

1024
01:44:56,873 --> 01:44:58,541
Tell me,

1025
01:44:59,668 --> 01:45:02,712
what did you do with that
bag of guts, Killearn?

1026
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:10,886
Vex me not, MacGregor. Or I
shall have you dragged awhile.

1027
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,055
I'm a man of my word.

1028
01:45:15,517 --> 01:45:18,311
You're a thief,
a murderer,

1029
01:45:20,230 --> 01:45:22,231
and a violator of women.

1030
01:45:24,776 --> 01:45:27,695
I had hoped you'd come to me
long since on that score.

1031
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:32,450
If I had known earlier, you
would have been dead sooner.

1032
01:45:36,246 --> 01:45:39,832
I will tell you something
to take with you.

1033
01:45:41,626 --> 01:45:46,088
Your wife was far
sweeter forced

1034
01:45:46,798 --> 01:45:48,716
than many are willing.

1035
01:45:50,093 --> 01:45:53,596
In truth, put to it, I think
not all of her objected.

1036
01:46:29,216 --> 01:46:33,135
I appreciate the honor you do me,
Mistress MacGregor, in bringing your case.

1037
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:36,097
But from all I'm acquainted
with your husband,

1038
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:38,516
he has earned the enmity
of the Marquis of Montrose

1039
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:40,935
by borrowing money
that he cannot repay,

1040
01:46:41,019 --> 01:46:43,396
and ever harrying
his stock as blackmail.

1041
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:45,523
There is more to the matter, Your Grace.

1042
01:46:45,607 --> 01:46:49,402
I'm sure there is, but it is not
part of mine to intrude myself.

1043
01:46:49,986 --> 01:46:52,613
Sensible as I am
to your condition.

1044
01:46:54,324 --> 01:46:57,076
It's a hard thought,
but men make the quarrels

1045
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:59,495
and women and weans bear them.

1046
01:46:59,788 --> 01:47:04,333
Your Grace, Robert finds himself in
this condition for taking your part.

1047
01:47:05,752 --> 01:47:07,002
My part?

1048
01:47:08,171 --> 01:47:10,840
What cause had he to do
that and in what manner?

1049
01:47:12,259 --> 01:47:15,261
He refused to condemn
you by false witness

1050
01:47:15,345 --> 01:47:18,973
when the Marquis asked him
to say you were a Jacobite,

1051
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:21,976
to injure your name
at court.

1052
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:24,103
Montrose asked this of him?

1053
01:47:24,187 --> 01:47:25,980
In remission of this debt.

1054
01:47:27,482 --> 01:47:29,233
But Robert refused.

1055
01:47:30,986 --> 01:47:33,737
I did not know your husband
bore me such good will.

1056
01:47:34,823 --> 01:47:38,284
Indeed, Your Grace, I think he
favors you no more than any great man.

1057
01:47:40,036 --> 01:47:42,955
"As wolves at lambing"
is his word for you all.

1058
01:47:45,208 --> 01:47:47,626
It was not done
for Your Grace

1059
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:50,588
but for his own honor,

1060
01:47:50,797 --> 01:47:53,466
which he holds dearer
than myself or his sons,

1061
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:57,219
his clan or kin. And for
which I have oft chided him.

1062
01:47:59,556 --> 01:48:01,724
But it is him
and his way,

1063
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:05,936
and were he other, he would
not be Robert Roy MacGregor.

1064
01:48:08,231 --> 01:48:09,899
He would not come
here before you

1065
01:48:09,983 --> 01:48:12,276
nor would he favor me
to do so in his stead.

1066
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:18,073
But I have no choice, unless I
give him up entire to his enemies.

1067
01:48:20,577 --> 01:48:22,203
And though
I love his honor,

1068
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:26,582
it is but a moon-cast shadow
to the love I bear him.

1069
01:48:29,044 --> 01:48:32,379
For the grace of God,
I have his child inside me.

1070
01:48:33,757 --> 01:48:36,050
And I would have
a father for it.

1071
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:41,597
You do your man
no dishonor, Mary.

1072
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:46,519
Faith, he is a man
much blessed by fortune.

1073
01:49:12,379 --> 01:49:14,880
They have MacGregor,
my lord.

1074
01:49:34,150 --> 01:49:35,985
Cavalry, halt!

1075
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:39,113
Broken but not dead, Your
Lordship, as you requested.

1076
01:49:40,699 --> 01:49:41,699
Ungag him.

1077
01:49:47,163 --> 01:49:48,831
So, MacGregor,

1078
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,543
what have you
to say for yourself?

1079
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:56,755
I have been wronged
by Your Lordship

1080
01:49:57,674 --> 01:49:59,800
and by those
who serve him.

1081
01:50:00,051 --> 01:50:01,677
You are wronged?

1082
01:50:02,345 --> 01:50:03,387
You?

1083
01:50:04,139 --> 01:50:07,600
If I am not much mistaken, it
is myself that is short £1,000,

1084
01:50:07,684 --> 01:50:11,645
whose cattle is reived, and whose
factor, Killearn, is abducted.

1085
01:50:12,314 --> 01:50:15,357
Then ask this thing here
where your money is

1086
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:19,194
and where he sunk Alan
McDonald after he killed him.

1087
01:50:21,531 --> 01:50:24,366
Same accusations he spat
at me, Your Lordship.

1088
01:50:24,743 --> 01:50:26,744
Desperate words
from a desperate man.

1089
01:50:28,246 --> 01:50:30,789
Do you have proofs
of these matters?

1090
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:34,752
You have my word on it.

1091
01:50:36,671 --> 01:50:39,381
I think it will take
more than that.

1092
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:43,093
Then you have the nature
of this man here.

1093
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:47,640
If Your Lordship cannot tell
what is true from what is not,

1094
01:50:49,309 --> 01:50:51,810
then I fear his judgment
is beyond repair.

1095
01:50:59,611 --> 01:51:01,612
Hang him from the bridge.

1096
01:51:18,296 --> 01:51:20,506
MacGregor!
Cut him free!

1097
01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:35,396
Bring him back here!

1098
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:37,815
I want him back!

1099
01:51:41,194 --> 01:51:42,986
Bring him
back here!

1100
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:48,409
In the water!

1101
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:37,958
I see him!
I see him!

1102
01:53:12,494 --> 01:53:14,369
Right through that gap!

1103
01:53:15,079 --> 01:53:16,955
Just through there!

1104
01:53:26,883 --> 01:53:28,300
Get off your mounts and walk.

1105
01:53:28,384 --> 01:53:30,219
What a stench!
Get after him!

1106
01:53:32,388 --> 01:53:35,015
What a stink!
Wait till you smell this.

1107
01:53:45,568 --> 01:53:47,694
Let's get downwind
of this.

1108
01:53:54,118 --> 01:53:55,953
Is this
where we may stay?

1109
01:53:56,037 --> 01:53:59,498
Aye, by His Grace's goodness,
under his protection.

1110
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:02,668
Will Father come here? If he can.

1111
01:54:17,892 --> 01:54:18,892
Coll!

1112
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:28,944
No!

1113
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:54,928
Robert?

1114
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:58,599
Robert!

1115
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:00,893
My Robert!

1116
01:55:10,278 --> 01:55:12,487
What have they
done with you?

1117
01:55:16,701 --> 01:55:18,952
You should have
told me, Mary.

1118
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:28,086
Robert, I should have,
but I could not.

1119
01:55:29,714 --> 01:55:32,090
Forgive me, my love.
I was wrong.

1120
01:55:32,842 --> 01:55:34,092
It was wrong.

1121
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:37,512
No. It was me
who was wrong.

1122
01:55:38,848 --> 01:55:41,391
You were right when you told
me I must have it my own way.

1123
01:55:41,476 --> 01:55:43,602
It's that which brought
all this on us.

1124
01:55:43,853 --> 01:55:47,064
I should have packed my pride
and given Montrose his way.

1125
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:49,983
No, Robert. And all this has come on us,

1126
01:55:50,068 --> 01:55:51,652
all this you have endured. No.

1127
01:55:51,819 --> 01:55:55,781
Craigrostan would still be ours.
Alasdair and Coll would be alive.

1128
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:57,366
And wrong would
have been done you!

1129
01:55:58,409 --> 01:56:01,495
And what of the wrong done
you, wrong past bearing?

1130
01:56:01,579 --> 01:56:05,374
No, not past bearing.
Not past bearing.

1131
01:56:06,709 --> 01:56:10,003
Not if I have my Robert
and he has himself.

1132
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:14,216
And you would not, not if you
had done a lesser man's bidding.

1133
01:56:18,137 --> 01:56:21,473
Honor is the gift a man gives
himself. You told our boys that.

1134
01:56:24,352 --> 01:56:27,896
Would you have stolen from yourself
that what makes you Robert MacGregor?

1135
01:56:35,905 --> 01:56:37,280
My Mary.

1136
01:56:42,203 --> 01:56:44,079
How fine you are to me.

1137
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:49,251
And you to me.

1138
01:57:15,945 --> 01:57:17,946
Robert, there is more.

1139
01:57:20,116 --> 01:57:21,450
What more?

1140
01:57:27,123 --> 01:57:29,082
I am carrying a child

1141
01:57:31,002 --> 01:57:33,628
and I do not know
who is the father.

1142
01:57:40,011 --> 01:57:41,344
Ach, Mary.

1143
01:57:42,346 --> 01:57:43,472
Mary.

1144
01:57:44,057 --> 01:57:46,266
I could not kill it,
husband.

1145
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:00,947
It is not the child
who needs killing.

1146
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:05,994
This point of honor
might likely kill you, sir.

1147
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:09,581
I have seen the man at work
and he is no dunce with a blade.

1148
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:13,502
If Your Grace could arrange this
I would be more beholding to him

1149
01:58:13,586 --> 01:58:15,253
than I already am.

1150
01:58:20,676 --> 01:58:23,345
Very well. I will see
what I can make of it.

1151
01:58:26,557 --> 01:58:27,891
MacGregor.

1152
01:58:28,601 --> 01:58:29,684
Sir?

1153
01:58:30,061 --> 01:58:32,187
He will kill you, MacGregor.

1154
01:58:33,022 --> 01:58:35,690
I would lose money
if I wagered other.

1155
01:58:38,694 --> 01:58:41,571
Your Lordship has my permission
to profit what way he may.

1156
01:58:59,841 --> 01:59:03,093
I have had a correspondence from
His Grace, the Duke of Argyll.

1157
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:07,222
It would seem that our
MacGregor is holed with him.

1158
01:59:08,015 --> 01:59:11,434
He offers us a match.
You and the Highlander.

1159
01:59:12,895 --> 01:59:16,064
Argyll would recoup his
loss from his last wager.

1160
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:21,027
Bring him on.

1161
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:24,823
You speak, Archibald?

1162
01:59:26,576 --> 01:59:30,078
One must never underestimate
the healing power of hatred.

1163
01:59:40,047 --> 01:59:42,215
How long must
you go, Father?

1164
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:43,341
Just for a while.

1165
01:59:43,426 --> 01:59:45,594
Is it business
you have with the Duke?

1166
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:47,679
Aye, business.

1167
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:57,439
So, boys, have you heard there's going
to be another addition to the family?

1168
02:00:00,985 --> 02:00:02,861
Show them where
it's hid, Mary.

1169
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:06,531
Is it inside you?

1170
02:00:08,326 --> 02:00:10,118
How does it get out?

1171
02:00:13,789 --> 02:00:15,749
The same road it got in.

1172
02:00:30,014 --> 02:00:31,306
Robert...

1173
02:00:31,724 --> 02:00:34,226
Robert, what if you don't... Wheesht.

1174
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:35,810
No, I cannot.

1175
02:00:42,193 --> 02:00:43,526
What if...

1176
02:00:45,321 --> 02:00:46,571
I cannot.

1177
02:00:48,032 --> 02:00:50,367
What if you do
not return to us?

1178
02:00:53,704 --> 02:00:55,997
If it's a boy,
call him Robert.

1179
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,501
If a lass,

1180
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:03,588
name her for my love,
Mary MacGregor.

1181
02:01:28,114 --> 02:01:30,448
My man Guthrie was like
an ox at the knacker's yard

1182
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:31,950
under Cunningham's blade.

1183
02:01:32,493 --> 02:01:34,869
You will need to be twice
as quick as poor Will.

1184
02:01:36,539 --> 02:01:37,789
Tell me, MacGregor,

1185
02:01:37,873 --> 02:01:40,667
is this matter of honor
concerning your wife?

1186
02:01:40,751 --> 02:01:42,752
It's concerning me,
Your Grace.

1187
02:01:42,837 --> 02:01:45,338
Mr. Cunningham and I
have matters outstanding.

1188
02:01:45,423 --> 02:01:48,591
She will not thank you for
making her a widow, honor or no.

1189
02:01:48,801 --> 02:01:51,511
Perhaps you'd like to wager
a sum for her maintenance.

1190
02:01:52,138 --> 02:01:56,057
If it will help you die any
easier, I'll lay 20 guineas for her.

1191
02:01:56,225 --> 02:01:58,018
50 would go further.

1192
02:01:58,144 --> 02:02:01,646
By God, but you have a
style to you, MacGregor.

1193
02:02:01,772 --> 02:02:04,399
I like that. Aye.

1194
02:02:39,435 --> 02:02:43,521
So, what are we to wager
on this outcome, Your Grace?

1195
02:02:44,148 --> 02:02:45,648
Guineas again?

1196
02:03:09,131 --> 02:03:12,592
I want no part of this. There
are more than champions here.

1197
02:03:13,552 --> 02:03:15,553
I think these men
hate the other.

1198
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:17,263
Aye.

1199
02:03:19,058 --> 02:03:20,975
They are none too fond.

1200
02:03:21,811 --> 02:03:23,561
You offered MacGregor
amnesty from his debts

1201
02:03:23,646 --> 02:03:25,522
if he would lay
charges against me.

1202
02:03:26,065 --> 02:03:29,567
So, that is how he cozened
you to give him shelter.

1203
02:03:30,528 --> 02:03:32,946
I know the truth
when I hear it.

1204
02:03:34,824 --> 02:03:38,827
And here was me thinking that
that was God's gift alone.

1205
02:03:38,911 --> 02:03:42,580
Do not think that all sins go
unpunished in this life, Montrose.

1206
02:03:43,332 --> 02:03:44,541
Well...

1207
02:03:47,128 --> 02:03:49,671
I see one set soon
to be paid for.

1208
02:03:56,637 --> 02:03:58,763
Will you not take
my odds, Argyll?

1209
02:03:59,181 --> 02:04:01,266
I give you five
on the fop.

1210
02:04:03,227 --> 02:04:05,019
I wager you but this,

1211
02:04:05,855 --> 02:04:09,357
if MacGregor lives, you will
acquit him of all he owes you.

1212
02:04:13,195 --> 02:04:14,779
And if he loses?

1213
02:04:16,198 --> 02:04:17,991
I will pay his bill.

1214
02:04:20,786 --> 02:04:23,705
My factor will call upon
Your Grace's factor.

1215
02:04:48,564 --> 02:04:50,565
You are here on
a matter of honor.

1216
02:04:50,649 --> 02:04:53,234
I am here to assure you
settle it honorably.

1217
02:04:54,111 --> 02:04:55,862
There will be
no backstabbing.

1218
02:04:55,946 --> 02:04:57,864
You will not
throw your blades,

1219
02:04:57,948 --> 02:05:00,909
nor will you use weapons
other than agreed.

1220
02:05:00,993 --> 02:05:02,869
If quarter is asked...

1221
02:05:02,953 --> 02:05:04,704
No quarter will be asked.

1222
02:05:04,914 --> 02:05:06,164
Or given.

1223
02:05:07,416 --> 02:05:11,377
Attend upon your weapons,
and commence upon my mark.

1224
02:09:48,822 --> 02:09:50,782
Neither asked nor given.

1225
02:10:55,055 --> 02:10:57,348
I will hold you
to our bargain.

1226
02:11:44,313 --> 02:11:46,230
Those wounds will need care.

1227
02:11:46,315 --> 02:11:49,317
By Your Grace's leave, I'll
go where it can best be found.

1228
02:11:50,152 --> 02:11:51,485
As you will.

1229
02:11:52,362 --> 02:11:54,614
I will know who to
wager on the next time.

1230
02:11:57,743 --> 02:12:00,286
I hope Your Grace
will live so long.

1231
02:13:10,399 --> 02:13:11,983
Mother! Look!
