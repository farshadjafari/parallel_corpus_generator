1
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,548
Dora!

2
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:32,620
Fagle!

3
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,094
Fagle!

4
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,192
Huh?

5
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,840
All right.
Hold still now.

6
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:05,350
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

7
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:14,464
Well...
Oh, sorry.

8
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,760
No, thanks.

9
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,302
Well, you're
in good health.

10
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,028
So how's Judith
and the kids?

11
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:23,769
Good. Everyone's good,
you know.

12
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,605
Danny must be, what?
About to be bar mitzvahed?

13
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:27,907
Two weeks.

14
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,971
Well, mazel tov!

15
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,413
They grow up fast,
don't they?

16
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,000
Hmm...

17
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,272
Hmm...

18
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,484
Yeah, you put the...

19
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,518
That's right, you put the...

20
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,984
You following this?

21
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:14,879
Okay?

22
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:17,380
So...

23
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,582
This part is exciting.

24
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:25,190
So, am I right?

25
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,727
So, okay So...

26
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,734
So, if that's that,
then we can do this.

27
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,895
And that's SchrÃ¶dinger's Paradox, right?

28
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,596
Is the cat dead?

29
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,673
Or is the cat
not dead?

30
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:38,936
Messages,
Professor Gopnik.

31
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,443
Thank you, Natalie.

32
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,780
Oh, Clive, come in.

33
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,111
So, what can I do for you?

34
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:53,687
Dr Gopnik, I believe the results

35
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,852
of the physics midterm
were unjust.

36
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,586
Uh-huh? How so?

37
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,927
I received
unsatisfactory grade.

38
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,263
In fact, F,
the failing grade.

39
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,033
Yes. You failed the midterm.
That's accurate.

40
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,697
Yes, but that is not just.

41
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,909
I was unaware to be
examined on the mathematics.

42
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:15,140
Well, you can't do physics without
mathematics, really, can you?

43
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,706
If I receive the failing
grade, I lose my scholarship,

44
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,081
and I feel shame.

45
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:23,818
I understand the physics.
I understand the dead cat.

46
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,484
But you can't really
understand the physics

47
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,322
without understanding
the math.

48
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,159
The math tells how it really
works That's the real thing.

49
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,826
The stories I give you in
class are just illustrative.

50
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,769
They're like fables, say,
to help give you a picture.

51
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,136
I mean...

52
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:45,808
Even I don't understand
the dead cat.

53
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,777
The math is how
it really works.

54
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,177
Very difficult.

55
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,671
Very difficult.

56
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,774
Well, I'm sorry, but I...

57
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:53,943
What do you propose?

58
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,145
- Passing grade.
- No, no.

59
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,448
Or perhaps I can
take the midterm again.

60
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,286
I know now it cover
the mathematics.

61
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,087
Well, the other students
wouldn't like that, would they?

62
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,687
If one student gets to retake the
test until he gets a grade he likes?

63
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,432
- Secret test
- No...

64
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,133
- Hush-hush.
- No.

65
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,760
That's just not workable.

66
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,864
I'm afraid we'll just have to bite
the bullet on this thing, Clive...

67
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,338
Very troubling.

68
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,302
Very troubling.

69
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,456
Sy Ableman.

70
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,620
Hello, Sy
Larry Gopnik.

71
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,530
Larry. How are you,
my friend?

72
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,288
Good How you been, Sy?

73
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:44,200
Fine Can
we talk, Larry?

74
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:45,963
What? You...
Uh...

75
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:48,304
Hello? Larry?

76
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,634
Call back!

77
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,869
Clive!

78
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:05,018
That was Sy Ableman.

79
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,490
He said he
got disconnected.

80
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:10,683
Out in a minute.

81
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,992
I gotta wash my hair.
I'm going out tonight.

82
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,088
I'll be out in a minute.

83
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,666
Jesus Christ!

84
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,428
Why is Uncle Arthur
always in the bathroom?

85
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,769
He has to drain his
sebaceous cyst. You know that.

86
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,897
Will you set the table?

87
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,239
Why can't he do it in the
basement or out in the garage?

88
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,714
I had 20 bucks in it,
too. Inside the case.

89
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,273
Twenty bucks?
How come?

90
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,545
Bought a lid from Mike
Fagle a couple of weeks ago.

91
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,713
Still owed him 20.

92
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:39,451
He already
gave you the pot?

93
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:42,887
Yeah. But a couple of weeks
ago, my funding got cut off.

94
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:45,730
Fagle said he'd pound the crap
out of me if I didn't pay up.

95
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,061
What funding got cut off?
Where do you get your money?

96
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,101
What happened?

97
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,066
Rabbi Turchik took his
radio Had money in it.

98
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,398
That fucker!

99
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,268
Yeah. I think he said
he was confiscating it.

100
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,203
He's a fucker. Where
do you get your money?

101
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,798
Mike Fagle's
gonna kick his ass.

102
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,377
Last week he pounded the
crap out of Seth Seddlemeyer.

103
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:01,708
He's a fucker!

104
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,942
- Fagle or Seth Seddlemeyer?
- They're both fuckers!

105
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:05,907
Out in a minute!

106
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,076
Are you still in there?

107
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,983
Yeah,
I'll be out in a minute!

108
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,003
Arthur!

109
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,604
- Yeah?
- Dinner!

110
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,744
Okay,
out in a minute!

111
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:39,978
We should wait.

112
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,314
Are you kidding?

113
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,425
Mr. Brandt keeps mowing
part of our lawn.

114
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:52,961
Does that matter?

115
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,356
What?

116
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,967
Is it important?

117
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,800
It's just odd.

118
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,634
Mom, how long is Uncle
Arthur staying with us?

119
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,265
Ask your father.

120
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,151
Honey.

121
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,217
Honey.

122
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,555
Did you talk to Sy?

123
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,257
Sy?

124
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,227
Sy Ableman That's
right, he called But I...

125
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,857
- You didn't talk to him?
- No.

126
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,404
You know the problems that
you and I have been having?

127
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,530
Mmm-hmm.

128
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:12,236
Well, Sy and I
have become very close.

129
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,743
In short, I think it's time that
we start talking about a divorce.

130
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,548
Sy Ableman?

131
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,057
This is not about Sy.

132
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,718
You mentioned Sy!

133
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,886
Don't twist my words,
Larry.

134
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:33,522
A divorce? What have I done?
I haven't done anything.

135
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:35,463
Larry, don't be a child.

136
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,298
You haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.

137
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,567
Yes! Yes, we haven't
done anything.

138
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,632
And I'm probably
about to get tenure.

139
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,144
Nevertheless, there have
been problems, as you know...

140
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,578
- Well...
- ...and things have changed.

141
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:52,480
And then, Sy Ableman.

142
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,249
Sy has come into
my life, and I...

143
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,415
Come into your... What does
that mean? You barely know him.

144
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,617
Oh, please We've known the
Ablemans for 15 years, Larry!

145
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,320
Yes, but you said
we hadn't done anything.

146
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,121
I haven't done anything.

147
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:10,162
This is not some
flashy fling, Larry.

148
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,067
This is not about
woopsy-doopsy.

149
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,634
Sy Ableman?

150
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,601
- I'll be out in a minute!
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

151
00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:20,269
Look, I didn't know any other
way of breaking it to you

152
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:23,144
except to just tell you
and treat you like an adult.

153
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,739
Is that so wrong?

154
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,845
Where do I sleep?

155
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,077
- What?
- Arthur's on the couch.

156
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,779
Look, Sy feels
that we should...

157
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:33,289
Esther is barely cold!

158
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,292
Esther died three years ago,

159
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,795
and it was a loveless marriage.

160
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,964
Sy wants a get.

161
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:45,660
- A what?
- A ritual divorce.

162
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,363
He says it's very important.

163
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,499
Without a gett,
I'm an aguna.

164
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:51,701
A what?

165
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,368
What are you
talking about?

166
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,878
You always act
so surprised.

167
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,471
I have begged you
to see the Rabbi.

168
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,823
Messages,
Professor Gopnik.

169
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,761
Yes, thanks for coming,
Clive. Have a seat.

170
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,107
We had, I think, a
good talk the other day,

171
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,236
...but you left something...
- I didn't leave it.

172
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:06,046
Well, you don't even know
what I was going to say.

173
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:07,550
I didn't leave anything.

174
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,053
I'm not missing anything.

175
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,917
I know where everything is.

176
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,122
Well then, Clive...

177
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,585
Where did this come from?

178
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,459
This is here, isn't it?

179
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,401
Yes, sir.
That is there.

180
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,563
This is not nothing.

181
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:27,970
This is something.

182
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,806
Yes. That is something.

183
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,238
- What is it?
- You know what it is, I believe.

184
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,909
- And you know I can't keep it, Clive.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:39,883
I'll have to pass it on
to Professor Finkle,

186
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,750
along with my suspicions
about where it came from.

187
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,617
Actions have consequences.

188
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:45,747
Yes. Often.

189
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,258
No, always! Actions
always have consequences!

190
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,228
In this office, actions
have consequences.

191
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,991
- Yes, sir.
- Not just physics,

192
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:54,326
...morally.
- Yes.

193
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,162
And we both know
about your actions.

194
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,236
No, sir.
I know about my actions.

195
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:01,932
I can interpret, Clive I know
what you meant me to understand.

196
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,634
Meer sir my sir.

197
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,079
"Meer sir my sir"?

198
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,515
Mere surmise, sir.

199
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,009
Very uncertain.

200
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,481
You little brat fucker!

201
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,682
You snuck 20 bucks
out of my drawer!

202
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,854
Studying Torah,
asshole.

203
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,893
You little brat!
I'm telling Dad!

204
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,355
You gonna tell him you've been
sneaking it out of his wallet?

205
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:01,661
You know what I'm gonna do, you
little brat, if you don't give it back?

206
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:03,663
Dad?

207
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:06,333
Dad, you've
gotta fix the aerial.

208
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,395
Hello, Larry. Have you
thought about a lawyer?

209
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,804
- Dad!
- Honey, please!

210
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:10,967
We're not getting
channel four at all.

211
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,339
Can we
discuss it later?

212
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:13,570
I can't get F Troop.

213
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,009
Larry, the
children know.

214
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,479
Do you think
this is some secret?

215
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,071
Do you think this is something
we're going to keep quiet?

216
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:19,740
Dad, Uncle Arthur is
in the bathroom again,

217
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,011
and I'm going
to the Hole at 8:00.

218
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,347
- Out in a minute!
- Ow! Stop!

219
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,412
- She keeps doing that!
- What's going on?

220
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:54,346
Arthur?

221
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:55,777
Yes?

222
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,588
What are you doing?

223
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,184
Working on the Mentaculus.

224
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,898
Any luck, um,

225
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,026
looking for an apartment?

226
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:15,396
No.

227
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,489
- Sy.
- Good to see you, Larry.

228
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:37,317
I'll get Judith.

229
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,330
No, listen, actually, I'm
here to see you, if I might.

230
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,897
Such a thing
Such a thing.

231
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,993
Shall we go
in the kitchen?

232
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:50,837
You know, Larry, the way we
handle ourselves in this situation,

233
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,107
so important.

234
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:54,906
- Uh-huh?
- Absolutely.

235
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,503
Judith told me that she
broke the news to you,

236
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,641
and she said that
you were very adult.

237
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,618
- Did she?
- Absolutely.

238
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,080
The respect she has
for you...

239
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,685
- Yes?
- Do you drink wine?

240
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,287
Because this is
an incredible bottle.

241
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,622
This is not
Mogen David, Larry.

242
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,424
This is a wine A Bordeaux.

243
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,125
- You know, Sy...
- Open it.

244
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,792
Let it breathe.
Ten minutes.

245
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,336
Letting it breathe,
so important.

246
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,201
Thanks, Sy,
but I'm not...

247
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,797
Listen, I insist, Larry.
There's no cause for discomfort.

248
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,934
I'd be uncomfortable
if you didn't take it.

249
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,137
Larry, listen.
These are signs.

250
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:29,474
Tokens, Larry.

251
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:30,946
I'm just...
I'm not ungrateful.

252
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,278
I just don't know
a lot about wine,

253
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,875
...and given our...
- It's okay.

254
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,646
...respective...
- It's okay.

255
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:42,348
Larry, we're
going to be fine.

256
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,567
Want some of this,
fucker?

257
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:25,426
Fuck.

258
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,561
Would you read this?
Tell me what you think?

259
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:42,625
Okay.

260
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,032
Boy! You should have
worn a hat.

261
00:32:10,494 --> 00:32:12,429
Let's see
some hustle, Mitch.

262
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,502
Larry?

263
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,011
Hi, Arlen.

264
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:07,811
Larry, I feel that as head of the
tenure committee, I should tell you this.

265
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:13,624
Though it should be no cause for concern,
and you should not at all be worried.

266
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,016
Okay.

267
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:17,651
But I feel
I should mention it,

268
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:21,688
even though it will carry
no weight in our decision

269
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,357
on whether or not
to grant you tenure.

270
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,130
So again,
no cause for concern.

271
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:28,637
Okay, Arlen
Give what any weight?

272
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,240
Well...

273
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,402
We've received
a number of letters

274
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:38,509
denigrating you
and urging us not to...

275
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,243
Not to grant you tenure.

276
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,055
From who?

277
00:33:44,154 --> 00:33:47,682
Well, they're anonymous,
so we dismiss them completely.

278
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:50,160
Well, what do they say?

279
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,757
Well, they
make allegations...

280
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,888
Well, allegations...
Assertions.

281
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,867
And though we give them
no credence at all, Larry.

282
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:01,193
Well, I'm not really
at liberty

283
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,866
to discuss the specifics of
the committee's deliberations.

284
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:07,673
But I think you're saying these won't
play any part in your deliberations?

285
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,043
None whatsoever.

286
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,081
So what are they?

287
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,014
Moral turpitude,
you could say.

288
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:17,181
Uh-huh. Can I ask? Are they...

289
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,280
- Are they idiomatic?
- Hmm?

290
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:24,192
The reason I ask, I have a
Korean student. South Korean.

291
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:28,130
A disgruntled South Korean, and I
meant to talk to you about this...

292
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:33,398
Oh, no, no They're competently,
even eloquently written.

293
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:37,065
A native English speaker.
There's no question about that.

294
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:39,541
- Uh-huh.
- Let me reiterate.

295
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,077
No cause for concern.

296
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:45,981
I only speak because I
would feel odd concealing it.

297
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,710
- Yes.
- Yeah.

298
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:50,811
Best to Judith.

299
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,994
I gotta get
my radio back.

300
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,293
Maybe the fucker lodged
it up his fucking asshole.

301
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,733
I gotta get it back, or Mike Fagle's
gonna pound the crap out of me.

302
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:07,269
Way up his asshole.

303
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:22,679
Good afternoon.

304
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:27,746
Go scrub up, Mitch.

305
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,952
Been hunting?

306
00:35:37,534 --> 00:35:38,967
Is that a...

307
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,469
It's gonna be
a boat shed.

308
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,835
Uh-huh.

309
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,929
That's great.

310
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,976
- Mr. Brandt...
- I said scrub up, Mitch!

311
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:53,315
Isn't this a school day?

312
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,443
I took him out of school today
so he could hunt with his dad.

313
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:00,554
Uh, Mr Brandt,

314
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,626
that's just about at
the property line there.

315
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,059
I don't think
we're supposed to get

316
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,789
...within, what, 10 feet...
- Property line's the poplar.

317
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,293
- The...
- Poplar.

318
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,630
- Well, even if it is, you're just
about over it. - Measure.

319
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,706
- I don't have to measure, you
can tell it's... - Line's the poplar.

320
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:18,199
What's going on?

321
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,666
Nothing.

322
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,177
- Larry?
- Yeah?

323
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,840
Did you go to
Sieglestein Schlutz?

324
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,009
No, I...
Not yet.

325
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,143
Larry.

326
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,481
Appointment Monday.

327
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,851
Where are you going?

328
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,184
I'm going to the Hole.

329
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,849
What? At 5:00?

330
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,416
We're stopping at Laurie Kipperstein's
house so I can wash my hair.

331
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:38,052
Hi, Mr Gopnik.

332
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,590
- You can't wash it here?
- Uncle Arthur's in the bathroom.

333
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,257
I'll be out
in a minute!

334
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,425
- Are you ready?
- Huh?

335
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,025
- We're meeting Sy at Embers.
- I am?

336
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,434
Both of us.
I told you, Larry.

337
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,668
Larry.

338
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:56,103
How are you?

339
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:58,940
Sy.

340
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:02,543
Hello, Judith.

341
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:03,608
Hello, Sy.

342
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:09,088
Larry, I want to
thank you for coming.

343
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,920
It's so important that we be
able to discuss these things.

344
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,726
I'm happy to come
to Embers, Sy.

345
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:17,289
But I'm thinking, really,
maybe it's best to leave

346
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,733
these discussions
to the lawyers.

347
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:21,635
Of course Legal matters,
you let the lawyers discuss.

348
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,731
You don't mix
apples and oranges.

349
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:25,240
I have begged you
to see the lawyer.

350
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,572
I told you,
I'm going Monday.

351
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:29,306
Monday is timely.
This is not...

352
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:33,077
Please, Embers is not the forum
for legalities You're so right.

353
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,811
No, Judith and I wanted
merely to discuss, uh,

354
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:41,090
practicalities.
Living arrangements.

355
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:45,259
After all, this is an issue
where no one is at odds.

356
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,489
Living arrangements?

357
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:50,896
I think we all agree
that the children

358
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,063
not being contaminated
with the tension,

359
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,264
the most important.

360
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,331
We shouldn't put the kids
in the middle of this, Larry.

361
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,465
The kids aren't...

362
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,476
I'm saying "we."
I'm not pointing fingers.

363
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:03,273
No one is playing
the blame game, Larry.

364
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,440
I didn't say
anyone was.

365
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,483
Well, let's not play "He
Said, She Said," either.

366
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,608
- I wasn't! I...
- All right. Look, look, look.

367
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:12,452
Let's just take a step back and
we can diffuse the situation.

368
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,152
You know, Larry,
sometimes I find that

369
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,923
if I count to 10...

370
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:22,923
One,

371
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,190
two,

372
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:27,762
three,

373
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,434
four...

374
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,706
Or silently.

375
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,813
Really, to keep things
on an even keel

376
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,786
leading up to
Danny's bar mitzvah...

377
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,652
A child's
bar mitzvah, Larry.

378
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:50,454
Sy and I think it's best if
you move out of the house.

379
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:52,784
Move out?

380
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:55,331
- Well, it makes eminent sense.
- Things can't continue as they...

381
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,867
Move out?
Where would I go?

382
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:00,027
Well, for instance, the
Jolly Roger is quite livable.

383
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,400
It's not expensive.

384
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,065
The rooms are
eminently habitable.

385
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,664
This would allow you
to visit the kids.

386
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:07,835
There's convenience in its
favor They've got a pool.

387
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:10,574
Wouldn't it make more sense
for you to move in with Sy?

388
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,641
Larry.

389
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:17,179
Larry, you...
You are jesting.

390
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:21,021
I think, really,
the Jolly Roger

391
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,152
is the appropriate
course of action.

392
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:30,693
Listen here,

393
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,429
you little fucker,
I want my money!

394
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,831
Stop it!
I'm gonna get it!

395
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:34,862
Give it back!

396
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:36,565
You owe me 20 bucks,
you little shit!

397
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:38,608
- Don't worry about it!
- Give it, brat fucker!

398
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:41,210
- I'm gonna get it! I'm gonna get it!
- Brat! Fucker!

399
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,940
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

400
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,342
- What was that?
- Nothing.

401
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:50,076
How's the Torah
portion coming?

402
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,554
Can you maybe
use the hi-fi?

403
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:53,885
- What?
- Can I borrow this?

404
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,860
I'm taking some stuff to,
you know, the Jolly Roger.

405
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,054
- Dad!
- Sure, Dad.

406
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,121
Dad! Chinese guy!

407
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,690
Culture clash.

408
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,596
Culture clash.

409
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,708
With all respect, Mr. Park,
I don't think it's that.

410
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,072
- Yes.
- No,

411
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,737
it would be a culture clash if
it were the custom in your land

412
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,246
to bribe people
for grades.

413
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,440
Yes.

414
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:22,144
So, you're saying
it is the custom?

415
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,552
No, this is defamation.
Ground for lawsuit.

416
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,248
Let me get this straight.

417
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,918
You're threatening to sue
me for defaming your son?

418
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,119
Yes.

419
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,992
- But it would...
- Is this man bothering you?

420
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,963
Is he bothering me? No.

421
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,166
I, uh...

422
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:48,842
See, look...

423
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,608
If it were defamation,
there would have to be

424
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,775
someone I was defaming him to, or I...

425
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:54,909
All right,
let's keep it simple.

426
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:58,422
I could pretend the money never
appeared That's not defaming anyone.

427
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,855
Yes. And passing grade.

428
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,152
- Passing grade?
- Yes.

429
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,753
Or you'll sue me?

430
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:06,956
For taking money.

431
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,793
So he did leave the money?

432
00:41:08,865 --> 00:41:10,128
This is defamation!

433
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,463
It doesn't make sense. Either
he left the money or he didn't.

434
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,871
Please.
Accept the mystery.

435
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,041
Give me that, fucker.

436
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,615
He's very
good with numbers.

437
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:34,054
I think his social skills
have held him back.

438
00:41:34,157 --> 00:41:36,148
Such a sweet man, though.

439
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:37,523
Arthur has
a good heart.

440
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:41,028
And he never complains,
unlike me.

441
00:41:42,065 --> 00:41:44,000
Sometimes I don't
give him enough credit.

442
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,833
He tried to tell me about this
thing he's working on, this...

443
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,735
The Mentaculus.

444
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:56,070
He says it's a probability
map of the universe.

445
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,413
Does he go out
socially at all?

446
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,509
He tries. He's been going to the
singles mixers at Hillel House.

447
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:08,054
I should talk.
I'm not doing any better.

448
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:10,688
How is Judith?

449
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,525
Fine. She's fine.

450
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:20,371
Sometimes these things
just aren't meant to be.

451
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:24,340
And it can take a while before
you feel what was always there.

452
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,775
- For better or worse.
- I never felt it!

453
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,077
It was a bolt
from the blue.

454
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:31,375
What does that mean?

455
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:35,215
Everything that I thought was
one way turns out to be another.

456
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:40,918
Then, it's an opportunity to
learn how things really are.

457
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,692
I don't mean to sound glib.

458
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:49,793
It's not always easy deciphering
what God is trying to tell you,

459
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,530
but it's not something you have
to figure out all by yourself.

460
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,300
We're Jews.

461
00:42:56,773 --> 00:43:00,710
We've got that well of tradition
to draw on, to help us understand.

462
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:04,074
When we're puzzled,
we have all the stories

463
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:07,878
that have been handed down from
people who had the same problems.

464
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,911
Have you talked to
Rabbi Nachtner?

465
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,626
Why not see him?

466
00:43:16,726 --> 00:43:18,387
What's the Rabbi
gonna tell me?

467
00:43:18,795 --> 00:43:20,490
If I knew,
I'd be the Rabbi.

468
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:24,563
The air out
here is magnificent.

469
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:30,166
I'm telling you, if someone
could bottle this air,

470
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:32,070
they'd make
a million dollars.

471
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,760
Hello, Larry.
Good to see you.

472
00:43:50,827 --> 00:43:52,193
Oh. Rabbi Scott.

473
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,657
I thought I was going
to see Rabbi Nachtner.

474
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,858
He was called away
on an etz monim.

475
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,666
Ruth Brynn's mother is in the
hospital and she isn't doing well.

476
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:05,036
Rabbi Nachtner asked me to
cover for him. Come on in.

477
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:20,121
And she wants a gett.

478
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:26,221
A what?

479
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,697
- She wants a...
- Oh, a gett.

480
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,358
Uh-huh. Sure.

481
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,833
I feel like the carpet's
been yanked out from under me.

482
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:38,170
I don't
know which end is up.

483
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,039
I'm not even sure
how to react.

484
00:44:40,143 --> 00:44:41,474
I'm too confused.

485
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:45,576
What reasons did she
give for the rupture?

486
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:48,242
She didn't give reasons
Just that,

487
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:50,581
you know, things
haven't been going well.

488
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,746
And is that true?

489
00:44:52,422 --> 00:44:53,913
I guess.
I don't know.

490
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,186
She's usually right
about these things.

491
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,728
I was hoping that
Rabbi Nachtner could...

492
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,255
That he would...
He would... Yes?

493
00:45:01,364 --> 00:45:03,594
Well, with the benefit
of his life experience.

494
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:05,527
No offense.

495
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:08,766
No, of course
not I am the junior rabbi.

496
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,206
And it's true, the point of
view of somebody who's older

497
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:17,713
and perhaps had similar
problems might be more valid.

498
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:20,842
And you should see the senior
rabbi as well, by all means.

499
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,112
Or even Marshak,

500
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,382
if you can get in.

501
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:27,048
He's quite busy,
but maybe...

502
00:45:31,394 --> 00:45:32,918
Can I share
something with you?

503
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:36,197
Because I, too, have had
the feeling of losing track

504
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,065
of Hashem,
which is the problem here.

505
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:42,402
I, too, have forgotten
how to see him in the world,

506
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:44,532
and when that happens,
you think,

507
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:48,601
"Well, if I can't see him,
he isn't there. He's gone."

508
00:45:48,878 --> 00:45:50,471
But that's not the case.

509
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:53,974
You just need to
remember how to see him.

510
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,382
Am I right? I mean...

511
00:45:57,487 --> 00:45:59,478
The parking lot here.

512
00:46:02,492 --> 00:46:03,925
Not much to see.

513
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,257
But if you imagine
yourself a visitor,

514
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,001
somebody who isn't familiar
with these autos and such,

515
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,663
somebody still with
the capacity for wonder.

516
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:17,934
Someone with
a fresh perspective.

517
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,806
That's what it is, Larry.

518
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:21,934
Because with
the right perspective,

519
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:25,471
you can see Hashem, you
know, reaching into the world.

520
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,313
He is in the world,
not just in shul.

521
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:33,922
It sounds to me like you're looking
at the world, looking at your wife,

522
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,925
through tired eyes.

523
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:40,188
It sounds like she's
become a sort of thing...

524
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,454
A problem.

525
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,126
A thing.

526
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,327
She is seeing Sy Ableman.

527
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,972
- Oh.
- They're planning...

528
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,510
That's why
they want the gett.

529
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:56,842
Oh I'm sorry.

530
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,471
It was his idea.

531
00:46:58,548 --> 00:47:03,987
Well, they do need a gett
to remarry in the faith.

532
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:08,213
But... This is life.

533
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:13,059
You have to see these things
as expressions of God's will.

534
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,063
You don't have to
like it, of course.

535
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:17,831
The boss isn't always right,
but he's always the boss.

536
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:19,699
That's right!

537
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,532
Things aren't so bad.

538
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,902
Look at
the parking lot, Larry.

539
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,806
Just look at
that parking lot.

540
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,088
Are we eating already?

541
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,594
Sarah's going out.

542
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,561
Ow! Cut it out!

543
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:49,893
What's going on?

544
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,195
Isn't Dad eating?

545
00:47:57,273 --> 00:47:58,605
He's at
the Jolly Roger.

546
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:00,905
Oh, yeah.

547
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:07,375
How are you, Larry?

548
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,942
Jesus, I am so sorry

549
00:48:10,086 --> 00:48:12,577
- to be seeing you under these
circumstances. - Oh, well...

550
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,250
I always thought you
and Judy were rock solid.

551
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:18,590
This is so terrible, Larry.
This is devastating.

552
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,061
Well, you know,
the way I look at it,

553
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,692
it's an opportunity for me to
really sit down and figure things out

554
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:28,034
and look at the world afresh
instead of just, you know,

555
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:32,041
settling for the routine, tired
old way of looking at things.

556
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:34,936
Really?

557
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,713
I don't know,
maybe not.

558
00:48:39,382 --> 00:48:42,715
Well, legally,
I have to warn you,

559
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:45,255
it's never easy
for the husband.

560
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:48,155
Unless, of course,
there's some question

561
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:52,490
of the wife having violated
the marriage contract?

562
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,621
Oh, no, no
Nothing like that.

563
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,291
Although she is planning to
marry Sy Ableman, but they...

564
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,766
Sy Ableman!

565
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:02,931
- Yes. But they...
- Esther is barely cold!

566
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,072
She passed
three years ago.

567
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:09,340
Well... Still, this changes
the complexion, Larry.

568
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,179
Sy Ableman.

569
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,079
Not in the sense that... T
here hasn't been hanky-panky.

570
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,242
To my knowledge.

571
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:18,617
- Oh? - No I'm fairly
certain this is not an issue.

572
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:21,851
And in fact,
Judith wants a gett.

573
00:49:24,427 --> 00:49:25,519
A what?

574
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,186
A ritual divorce.

575
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,425
- Oh.
- So that they can remarry in the faith.

576
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,764
Uh-huh.
Yeah, sure, uh...

577
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,862
Well, not really
a legal issue.

578
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,036
Okay, um...

579
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:40,974
Good. Good.

580
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:43,474
Well...

581
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,983
On the other thing, the
neighbor's property line,

582
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,679
I've asked Solomon
Schlutz to take a look.

583
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:53,153
There's very little to do with
real estate that'll get by Sol.

584
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:54,987
Okay Good
How do you...

585
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:56,548
I guess
I'm a little worried.

586
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:58,820
How do you...
I have money pressures...

587
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:00,989
Our fee structure?
We bill by the hour.

588
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:04,329
Dave Sieglestein and
Solomon Schlutz bill at 110.

589
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,233
The associates, me,
for instance, bill at...

590
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,806
Call for Mr Gopnik
Danny at home.

591
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,898
You can take it here.

592
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,204
0809.

593
00:50:17,146 --> 00:50:18,135
Danny?

594
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,842
- Hey, Dad.
- Are you all right?

595
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:20,905
Are you all...

596
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,382
F Troop is fuzzy.

597
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,516
What?

598
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:27,351
F Troop is still fuzzy.

599
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,092
- Dad?
- Is everything okay?

600
00:51:58,849 --> 00:51:59,838
Clive?

601
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,108
Clive!

602
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:08,788
You little bastard! You
gonna send your mother next?

603
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,692
Little bastard!
I want to see you!

604
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:22,527
Hold on.

605
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,998
Professor Gopnik,
it's Dick Dutton again.

606
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,867
Dick Dutton.

607
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:29,969
Hello?

608
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,605
Hello, Mr Gopnik?

609
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:34,378
This is Dick Dutton from
the Columbia Record Club.

610
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,510
I'm calling because
it's now four months,

611
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,987
and we have yet to
receive your first payment.

612
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,983
There's some mistake.

613
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:46,393
I'm not a member
of the Columbian Record Club.

614
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:50,193
Sir, you are Lawrence Gopnik
of 8419 Fern Hill Road?

615
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,994
No, I live
at the Jolly Roger.

616
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:53,161
Excuse me?

617
00:52:53,836 --> 00:52:55,134
No, I...

618
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,201
Well, yes, okay.

619
00:52:58,307 --> 00:53:00,208
- Yes, you are Lawrence Gopnik?
- Okay.

620
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:01,969
"Okay" means...

621
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:04,309
Okay, yes,
Lawrence Gopnik, yes.

622
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,349
Okay, well, you received
your 12 introductory albums,

623
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:10,978
and you've been receiving the monthly
main selection for four months now...

624
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:12,681
The monthly main selection?
Is that a record?

625
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:14,518
I didn't ask
for any records.

626
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:17,753
To receive the monthly main
selection, you do nothing. You...

627
00:53:17,876 --> 00:53:19,434
That's right.
I haven't done anything.

628
00:53:19,545 --> 00:53:22,208
Yes, that's why you received
the monthly main selection.

629
00:53:22,347 --> 00:53:27,047
- But...
- The last one was Santana Abraxas. You...

630
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,577
I didn't ask
for Santana Abraxas.

631
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,782
You request
the main selection

632
00:53:32,891 --> 00:53:35,382
at the retail price
by doing nothing.

633
00:53:35,461 --> 00:53:37,396
It's automatically
mailed to you,

634
00:53:37,463 --> 00:53:38,954
plus shipping
and handling.

635
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:41,896
- You're about to receive...
- I can't afford a new record every month!

636
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:43,367
I haven't asked...

637
00:53:43,436 --> 00:53:46,405
You're about to get
Cosmo's Factory, sir.

638
00:53:46,472 --> 00:53:48,065
The June
main selection.

639
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:50,608
Look, look,
something is very wrong!

640
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:52,905
I don't want
Santana Abraxas.

641
00:53:52,978 --> 00:53:55,139
I've just been
in a terrible auto accident.

642
00:53:59,318 --> 00:54:00,478
I'm sorry, sir.

643
00:54:02,387 --> 00:54:05,755
Well, thank you.
But I...

644
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:07,648
Are you okay?

645
00:54:09,795 --> 00:54:12,764
Yes, yes.
No one was hurt.

646
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,490
Okay. Good.

647
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:21,934
Well, you had 14 days to
listen to Santana Abraxas.

648
00:54:22,007 --> 00:54:23,065
- Sir?
- Look...

649
00:54:23,143 --> 00:54:25,838
I didn't ask
for Santana Abraxas,

650
00:54:25,945 --> 00:54:29,436
I didn't listen
to Santana Abraxas,

651
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,449
I didn't do anything!

652
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,452
- Sir! Your son.
- Mr. Gopnik...

653
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:34,952
He says it's urgent.

654
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,318
We can't make you
listen to the record...

655
00:54:36,422 --> 00:54:38,083
- Okay, okay, okay...
- We provide...

656
00:54:38,157 --> 00:54:39,625
Okay, I have to
call you back.

657
00:54:39,692 --> 00:54:41,454
- This is... I'm sorry.
- No, no, Mr. Gopnik, please...

658
00:54:41,527 --> 00:54:43,085
- Danny?
- Yeah. Listen, Dad...

659
00:54:43,163 --> 00:54:44,858
Did you join
the Columbia Record Club?

660
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,527
- Danny?
- Um...

661
00:54:48,635 --> 00:54:51,865
Danny, this is completely
unacceptable. I can't afford to...

662
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:53,666
Okay, Dad, but you
gotta come home.

663
00:54:55,175 --> 00:54:56,436
Is it F Troop?

664
00:54:56,509 --> 00:54:58,443
No, Mom's real upset.

665
00:55:10,523 --> 00:55:11,489
Dad?

666
00:55:11,557 --> 00:55:12,650
Yes?

667
00:55:12,724 --> 00:55:14,693
Does this mean I can't
go to the Hole tonight?

668
00:55:14,793 --> 00:55:16,693
Does what mean?
What happened?

669
00:55:16,795 --> 00:55:19,128
Oh, Sy Ableman,
he died in a car crash.

670
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:20,222
Hey, Dad.

671
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:21,690
What?

672
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,199
So you're coming back home?

673
00:55:24,204 --> 00:55:25,329
Can you fix
the aerial?

674
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,463
What?

675
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:28,666
It's still,
you know...

676
00:56:02,608 --> 00:56:05,237
She seems to be
asking an awful lot.

677
00:56:07,045 --> 00:56:09,014
But then...
I don't know.

678
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,610
Somebody has to pay
for Sy's funeral.

679
00:56:12,585 --> 00:56:13,552
Uh-huh.

680
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:15,052
His own estate
is in probate,

681
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,952
but why does it
have to be me?

682
00:56:17,056 --> 00:56:19,182
Or is it wrong
to complain?

683
00:56:19,592 --> 00:56:20,956
Judy says it is.

684
00:56:21,594 --> 00:56:23,561
But I'm so strapped
for cash right now,

685
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,565
carrying the mortgage, and
paying for the Jolly Roger,

686
00:56:26,632 --> 00:56:30,068
and I wrecked the car, and
Danny's bar mitzvah coming up, I...

687
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:32,969
Something like this,
there's never a good time.

688
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:36,403
I don't know
where it all leaves me.

689
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,601
Sy's death.

690
00:56:39,077 --> 00:56:42,103
Obviously, it's not going
to go back like it was.

691
00:56:42,215 --> 00:56:43,146
Mmm.

692
00:56:43,282 --> 00:56:45,217
- Would you even want that, Larry?
- No, I...

693
00:56:45,284 --> 00:56:48,721
Well, yeah.
Sometimes.

694
00:56:49,422 --> 00:56:50,411
Or...

695
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:53,121
I don't know.
I guess

696
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,228
the honest answer is,
I don't know.

697
00:56:56,295 --> 00:56:59,731
What was my life before?
Not what I thought it was.

698
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:01,929
So what does it all mean?

699
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,333
What is Hashem
trying to tell me,

700
00:57:04,436 --> 00:57:06,768
making me pay for
Sy Ableman's funeral?

701
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:08,101
- Mmm.
- And did I tell you

702
00:57:08,173 --> 00:57:11,108
I had a car accident
the same time Sy had his?

703
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,474
- The same instant, for all I know.
- Mmm.

704
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:17,309
Is Hashem trying to tell
me that Sy Ableman is me?

705
00:57:17,784 --> 00:57:20,309
Or that we are all one
or something?

706
00:57:21,788 --> 00:57:23,414
How does God speak to us?

707
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:25,681
It's a good question.

708
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,818
You know Lee Sussman.

709
00:57:28,594 --> 00:57:30,619
Dr Sussman?
I think I... Yeah.

710
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:33,697
Did he ever tell you
about the goy's teeth?

711
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:36,358
No Uh, what goy?

712
00:57:36,469 --> 00:57:39,597
So, Lee is at work one day.

713
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:43,166
You know, he has the orthodontic
practice there at Great Bear.

714
00:57:44,943 --> 00:57:46,309
He's making a plaster mold.

715
00:57:46,378 --> 00:57:49,974
It's for corrective bridgework in
the mouth of one of his patents,

716
00:57:50,048 --> 00:57:51,539
Russell Krauss.

717
00:58:03,362 --> 00:58:05,626
The mold dries, and Lee
is examining it one day

718
00:58:05,697 --> 00:58:08,063
before fabricating
an appliance.

719
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:09,862
He notices
something unusual.

720
00:58:13,172 --> 00:58:15,969
There appears to be
something engraved

721
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:18,909
on the inside of the
patentÂs lower incisors.

722
00:58:26,918 --> 00:58:30,376
Hey vav shin yud ayin nun yud.

723
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:34,025
Ho-she-ay-ni.

724
00:58:34,092 --> 00:58:36,425
"Help me. Save me."

725
00:58:36,728 --> 00:58:38,923
This, in a goy's mouth, Larry.

726
00:58:46,005 --> 00:58:47,666
He calls the goy back

727
00:58:47,739 --> 00:58:51,039
on the pretense of needling additional
measurements for the appliance.

728
00:58:51,411 --> 00:58:52,605
"How are you?

729
00:58:53,746 --> 00:58:55,713
"Noticed any other
problems with your teeth?"

730
00:58:57,884 --> 00:58:58,873
"No."

731
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,853
There it is.

732
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:10,018
Ho-she-ay-ni.

733
00:59:10,096 --> 00:59:11,085
"Help me." '

734
00:59:12,097 --> 00:59:13,086
Son of a gun.

735
00:59:16,436 --> 00:59:17,800
Sussman goes home.

736
00:59:18,704 --> 00:59:20,467
Can Sussman eat?
Sussman can't eat.

737
00:59:21,373 --> 00:59:23,807
Can Sussman sleep?
Sussman can't sleep.

738
00:59:29,981 --> 00:59:32,449
Sussman looks at the molds
of his other patents,

739
00:59:32,552 --> 00:59:33,813
goy and Jew alike,

740
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,978
seeking other messages.
He finds none.

741
00:59:36,922 --> 00:59:38,583
He looks In his own mouth.

742
00:59:39,224 --> 00:59:40,248
Nothing.

743
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:43,059
He looks
in his wife's mouth.

744
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:49,726
Nothing.

745
00:59:50,603 --> 00:59:52,764
But Sussman
is an educated man.

746
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,833
Not the world's
greatest sage, maybe.

747
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,168
No Rabbi Marshak.

748
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:59,501
But he knows a thing or two
about the Zohar and the Kabbalah.

749
00:59:59,612 --> 01:00:02,978
He knows that every Hebrew
letter has its numeric equivalent.

750
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:05,949
8- 4-5-4-4-7-3

751
01:00:06,018 --> 01:00:08,349
Seven digits.
A phone number, maybe?

752
01:00:10,489 --> 01:00:14,085
"Hello? Do you know a goy
named Krauss, Russell Krauss?"

753
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:15,184
"Who?"

754
01:00:15,293 --> 01:00:16,487
"Where have I called?

755
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:20,188
"The Red Owl in Bloomington?
Thanks so much."

756
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,030
He goes.

757
01:00:28,773 --> 01:00:31,766
It's a Red Owl
Groceries, what have you.

758
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:37,782
Sussman goes home
What does it mean?

759
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:41,186
He has to find out if he
is ever to sleep again.

760
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:43,219
He goes to see

761
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:45,983
the Rabbi Nachtner.

762
01:00:46,057 --> 01:00:48,958
He comes In, he sits right
where you're sitting, right now.

763
01:00:49,661 --> 01:00:51,027
"What does it mean, Rabbi?

764
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,699
"Is it a sign from Hashem? 'Help me'.

765
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,360
"I, Sussman, should be doing
something to help this goy.

766
01:00:57,469 --> 01:00:59,563
"Doing what?
The teeth don't say.

767
01:00:59,672 --> 01:01:03,300
"Or maybe I'm supposed to help people
generally lead a more righteous life?

768
01:01:04,476 --> 01:01:07,001
"Is the answer
in Kabbalah? In Torah?

769
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,744
"Or is there even a question?

770
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,242
"Tell me, Rabbi,
what can such a sign

771
01:01:14,586 --> 01:01:15,815
mean?"

772
01:01:23,896 --> 01:01:25,226
So? What did
you tell him?

773
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:27,755
Sussman?

774
01:01:28,034 --> 01:01:29,262
Yes.

775
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:31,528
Is it relevant?

776
01:01:31,603 --> 01:01:33,094
Well, isn't that why
you're telling me?

777
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:35,097
Okay.

778
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,867
Nachtner says, "Look.

779
01:01:37,943 --> 01:01:39,706
"The teeth, we don't know

780
01:01:39,778 --> 01:01:42,043
"A sign from Hashem?
Don't know.

781
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:43,436
"Helping others?

782
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:45,943
"Couldn't hurt."

783
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,451
No, no,
but who put it there?

784
01:01:52,557 --> 01:01:56,688
Was it for him, Sussman? Or for whoever
found it? Or for just... For, for...

785
01:01:56,762 --> 01:01:58,023
We can't know everything.

786
01:01:58,097 --> 01:01:59,860
It sounds like you don't know anything!

787
01:01:59,931 --> 01:02:01,297
Why even tell me the story?

788
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:04,125
First I should
tell you, then I shouldn't.

789
01:02:07,072 --> 01:02:08,369
What happened to Sussman?

790
01:02:08,773 --> 01:02:10,764
What would happen?
Not much.

791
01:02:10,876 --> 01:02:11,967
He went back to work.

792
01:02:12,545 --> 01:02:15,309
For a while, he checked every
patentÂs teeth for new messages.

793
01:02:15,414 --> 01:02:16,574
He didnÂt find any.

794
01:02:16,648 --> 01:02:18,639
In time, he found
he stopped checking.

795
01:02:20,418 --> 01:02:21,909
He returned to life.

796
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:29,324
These questions that are
bothering you, Larry,

797
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,985
maybe they're
like a toothache.

798
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:35,789
Feel them for a while,
then they go away.

799
01:02:36,302 --> 01:02:38,896
I don't want it to just
go away! I want an answer!

800
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:40,835
Sure We all
want the answer.

801
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,672
Hashem doesn't owe us
the answer, Larry.

802
01:02:44,175 --> 01:02:45,938
Hashem doesn't
owe us anything.

803
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,003
The obligation
runs the other way.

804
01:02:48,581 --> 01:02:50,947
Why does he make us
feel the questions

805
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:53,416
if he's not going to
give us any answers?

806
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:56,949
He hasn't told me.

807
01:03:02,327 --> 01:03:05,353
And what happened
to the goy?

808
01:03:05,797 --> 01:03:06,786
The goy?

809
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:09,690
Who cares?

810
01:03:10,135 --> 01:03:12,603
Sy Ableman
was a serious man.

811
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,704
Sy Ableman was a man
devoted to his community.

812
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:22,835
To Torah study To his
beloved wife, Esther,

813
01:03:22,947 --> 01:03:26,179
until three years ago
she passed,

814
01:03:26,284 --> 01:03:28,844
and to his duty,
as he saw it.

815
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:32,351
Where does such a man go?

816
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:37,728
A tzadik. Who knows,
maybe even a lamed vavnik.

817
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:39,822
A man beloved by all.

818
01:03:39,898 --> 01:03:42,298
A man who despised
the frivolous.

819
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:45,701
Could such
a serious man simply

820
01:03:46,905 --> 01:03:47,894
disappear?

821
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,402
We speak of olam ha-ba,
the world to come.

822
01:03:53,012 --> 01:03:54,001
Not heaven.

823
01:03:55,246 --> 01:03:58,010
Not what the gentiles
think of as afterlife.

824
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:01,519
"Olam ha-ba."
What is olam ha-ba?

825
01:04:03,054 --> 01:04:06,182
Where is olam ha-ba?

826
01:04:07,693 --> 01:04:11,992
Well, it is not a
geographic place, certainly.

827
01:04:12,063 --> 01:04:14,657
Like Canada.

828
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,335
Nor is it the
Eretz zavat chalav udvash,

829
01:04:18,403 --> 01:04:20,065
the land flowing
with milk and honey.

830
01:04:20,172 --> 01:04:23,266
For we are not promised
a personal reward.

831
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:25,442
A gold star.

832
01:04:26,545 --> 01:04:30,106
A first-class VIP lounge where we
get milk and cookies to eternity.

833
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:35,550
Olam ha-ba is
in the bosom of Abraham.

834
01:04:40,693 --> 01:04:41,853
Arthur Gopnik?

835
01:04:43,561 --> 01:04:45,052
Are you
Arthur Gopnik?

836
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:48,456
I'm Lawrence Gopnik.

837
01:04:48,567 --> 01:04:50,467
Do you go by the name
Arthur Gopnik?

838
01:04:50,568 --> 01:04:52,036
No.

839
01:04:52,103 --> 01:04:53,400
Is that Arthur Gopnik?

840
01:04:57,443 --> 01:05:00,206
Can you tell me what's going
on? We're sitting shiva here.

841
01:05:00,278 --> 01:05:01,371
You're what?

842
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,911
A religious observance.

843
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,076
We're bereaved.

844
01:05:06,251 --> 01:05:07,411
Who died?

845
01:05:07,485 --> 01:05:08,976
My wife's, uh...

846
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:12,916
It's a long story.

847
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:16,791
Look, you tell Gopnik, Arthur
Gopnik, he's breaking the law.

848
01:05:16,896 --> 01:05:19,262
We're not arresting him
now, but next time we will.

849
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:22,266
Gambling's against the law in this
state That's just the way it is.

850
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:25,166
All right.
Go back to your thing.

851
01:05:26,137 --> 01:05:27,434
Sorry, sir.

852
01:05:29,809 --> 01:05:33,505
Dad, we get channel four
now, but not channel seven.

853
01:05:33,612 --> 01:05:35,978
Arthur, how could you
do that to this family?

854
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,643
- On Sy's... - It's hardly a crime,
I mean, nobody got hurt.

855
01:05:39,751 --> 01:05:41,184
That doesn't
make it right!

856
01:05:41,286 --> 01:05:42,981
He won
a lot of money, Dad.

857
01:05:43,088 --> 01:05:44,817
The Mentaculus
really works!

858
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,356
You knew about it?

859
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,318
- Well...
- They must have finked me out.

860
01:05:51,297 --> 01:05:52,695
They knew I could
just go on winning,

861
01:05:52,797 --> 01:05:54,288
so they blackballed me
and now...

862
01:05:54,365 --> 01:05:55,833
What did you do with the money you won?

863
01:06:00,105 --> 01:06:01,333
What's going on?

864
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,304
Well, I didn't want it, and
Danny said that he could use it...

865
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,534
That is so unfair!

866
01:06:04,643 --> 01:06:05,974
- What are you...
- I'll tell you what's unfair.

867
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,012
What's unfair is them not letting
me play in their card game.

868
01:06:08,112 --> 01:06:10,137
Why give him the money? You
know what he spends it on?

869
01:06:10,215 --> 01:06:11,273
I know about
the records.

870
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:13,375
Records? Do you think he
buys records from Mike Fagle?

871
01:06:13,485 --> 01:06:14,976
At least I'm not saving
up for a nose job.

872
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,351
- What a brat!
- What?

873
01:06:16,454 --> 01:06:19,322
Nobody in this house is getting
a nose job! You got that?

874
01:06:20,693 --> 01:06:22,717
Danny! You're not excused!

875
01:06:22,827 --> 01:06:23,954
We're still talking!

876
01:06:24,028 --> 01:06:25,826
What was this
card game, Arthur?

877
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,889
Some goys put together
a private game.

878
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,193
I think that
they're Italian.

879
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,733
Danny!
What's going on?

880
01:06:30,835 --> 01:06:33,304
Danny? We're
sitting shiva here.

881
01:06:42,547 --> 01:06:48,349
Well, she has retained Barney
Silver at Tuchman, Marsh.

882
01:06:49,521 --> 01:06:51,182
This is a...

883
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:55,682
- This is an aggressive firm, Larry.
- Mmm-hmm.

884
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,695
These are not
pleasant people.

885
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:01,891
Judith is free to
retain whoever she...

886
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:05,327
I take it
you don't talk?

887
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:11,173
It's hard. I think she
emptied our bank account.

888
01:07:11,242 --> 01:07:12,210
Mmm.

889
01:07:12,277 --> 01:07:16,373
- I tried to ask her about it,
very civilly. She... - Yeah.

890
01:07:16,447 --> 01:07:21,784
Yeah, you need to open a new
account in your name only.

891
01:07:21,887 --> 01:07:24,253
Put your paychecks in
there from here on out.

892
01:07:24,356 --> 01:07:26,085
- Can I?
- Oh, absolutely.

893
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:27,715
It's not dishonest?

894
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,521
Oh, absolutely.

895
01:07:29,594 --> 01:07:31,186
- You...
- I hate to say this,

896
01:07:31,262 --> 01:07:35,028
but I think she's also been
sneaking cash out of my wallet.

897
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:37,125
Oh, boy Oh, boy.

898
01:07:37,469 --> 01:07:43,135
Yeah, well, this is
definitely adversarial.

899
01:07:46,744 --> 01:07:49,269
Larry? Are you
all right? Larry!

900
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:53,077
Hey, come on now! Larry!
There's no need for that.

901
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,914
Larry, Larry, we...

902
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:57,648
We're going to
get through this.

903
01:08:02,393 --> 01:08:04,885
Have you talked
to the Rabbi?

904
01:08:10,469 --> 01:08:12,164
I talked to Nachtner.

905
01:08:13,072 --> 01:08:15,505
Was he helpful
at all?

906
01:08:18,476 --> 01:08:20,637
What, did he tell you
about the goy's teeth?

907
01:08:22,514 --> 01:08:24,675
You should try to
talk to Marshak.

908
01:08:24,949 --> 01:08:28,113
They told me he doesn't
do pastoral work anymore.

909
01:08:28,186 --> 01:08:29,279
He just...

910
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:33,453
...congratulates the
bar mitzvah boy every week.

911
01:08:33,524 --> 01:08:34,855
Well, that's too bad.

912
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,659
He's a very wise man,
Marshak.

913
01:08:39,297 --> 01:08:40,595
Getting old.

914
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:42,693
Very old.

915
01:08:43,868 --> 01:08:45,699
No, me.

916
01:08:47,605 --> 01:08:50,199
- Uh, Dick Dutton. Columbia Record Club.
- Not now.

917
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:52,037
Does he ever
come to the phone?

918
01:08:55,613 --> 01:08:58,047
If I came in, could...

919
01:09:01,153 --> 01:09:04,054
Well, how about at Rabbi
Marshak's convenience?

920
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:06,952
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

921
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:10,359
Well, could I give you
my number at the Jolly Roger?

922
01:09:10,462 --> 01:09:13,158
X squared,
so that delta X equals

923
01:09:13,231 --> 01:09:16,326
the square root of
.077 A squared minus zero,

924
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:19,632
from which we derive the
square root of .077 A squared.

925
01:09:19,704 --> 01:09:21,229
And also, the uncertainty

926
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:24,639
in P is equal to the square
root of bracket P squared

927
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:27,177
minus bracket P squared,

928
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,737
which also equals the square
root of H over A squared.

929
01:09:29,847 --> 01:09:32,578
Which lets us
delta X, delta P

930
01:09:32,685 --> 01:09:36,587
equals the square root
of.077 A squared,

931
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:42,059
H over A squared,
and 1.74 H bar.

932
01:09:42,161 --> 01:09:43,525
Okay?

933
01:09:43,595 --> 01:09:45,153
The Uncertainty Principle.

934
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,858
It proves we can't
ever really know

935
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,492
what's going on.

936
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:58,703
But even though you can't
figure anything out,

937
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:01,609
you will be responsible
for it on the mid-term.

938
01:10:05,516 --> 01:10:07,780
- Did you follow that?
- Of course.

939
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:11,047
Except that I know
what's going on.

940
01:10:11,724 --> 01:10:13,213
How do you explain?

941
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:17,228
Well, it might be that in,
you know, in olam ha-ba...

942
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:20,390
Excuse me, not the point.
In this world, Larry.

943
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:25,195
Now I'll concede that
it's subtle, it's clever.

944
01:10:25,904 --> 01:10:28,634
But at the end of the day,
is it convincing?

945
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:31,109
Well, yes,
it's convincing.

946
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:33,234
It's a proof.
It's mathematics.

947
01:10:33,311 --> 01:10:37,645
No, excuse me. Mathematics
is the art of the possible.

948
01:10:38,449 --> 01:10:40,384
I don't think so.

949
01:10:40,452 --> 01:10:43,421
The art of the
possible, that's...

950
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:45,149
I can't remember.
Something else.

951
01:10:45,256 --> 01:10:46,587
I'm a serious man, Larry.

952
01:10:46,658 --> 01:10:50,650
- I know that So, if I've got it wrong,
what do I... - So simple.

953
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:53,421
See Marshak.

954
01:10:53,498 --> 01:10:56,627
I know! I want to see
Marshak! I want to see Marshak!

955
01:10:57,603 --> 01:10:59,434
I fucked your wife, Larry!

956
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,905
I seriously fucked her!
That's what's going on!

957
01:11:02,975 --> 01:11:03,998
See Marshak!

958
01:11:38,042 --> 01:11:39,442
Mr Gopnik.

959
01:11:39,511 --> 01:11:42,139
Hello, Mrs Samsky.

960
01:11:42,213 --> 01:11:45,512
I was going to knock, and then
I thought you weren't here.

961
01:11:46,217 --> 01:11:47,980
I thought
I heard something.

962
01:11:48,052 --> 01:11:49,953
Can I help you?
Do you want to come in?

963
01:11:50,021 --> 01:11:52,319
- No, I...
- It's cooler.

964
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:53,881
Oh. Okay.

965
01:11:56,127 --> 01:12:02,033
I've noticed that Mr Samsky
isn't around, and I, uh...

966
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,802
- He travels.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

967
01:12:06,872 --> 01:12:09,670
So I thought I should let you know,
since you're somewhat new here,

968
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:14,837
if you ever have, whatever,
chores that you'd, um...

969
01:12:14,912 --> 01:12:19,577
Or just help with something I've decided
to help others, in a neighborly way.

970
01:12:22,554 --> 01:12:23,918
- How thoughtful.
- Oh, it's nothing.

971
01:12:24,021 --> 01:12:27,548
It's just good to know
your neighbors, and to help.

972
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:29,091
Help others.

973
01:12:29,427 --> 01:12:33,887
Although I don't care much for my
neighbors on the other side, I must say.

974
01:12:34,932 --> 01:12:37,833
- Goys, aren't they?
- Mmm. Very much so.

975
01:12:37,903 --> 01:12:40,929
Although maybe it's not fair
to judge. I have to admit...

976
01:12:41,038 --> 01:12:42,404
Won't you sit down?

977
01:12:42,506 --> 01:12:44,872
Oh, um...
Okay. Thank you.

978
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:47,104
- Iced tea? I have some.
- Okay.

979
01:12:52,917 --> 01:12:54,545
I don't see you
much around either.

980
01:12:55,354 --> 01:12:59,722
Yes, actually I haven't been
home a lot recently. I, uh...

981
01:13:00,926 --> 01:13:03,121
My wife and I are...

982
01:13:04,128 --> 01:13:08,963
Well, she's got me staying at the Jolly
Roger, the little motel there on...

983
01:13:09,868 --> 01:13:11,631
You're in the
doghouse, huh?

984
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:16,965
Yes. That's an understatement,
I guess. Thank you.

985
01:13:17,074 --> 01:13:19,100
I guess I...

986
01:13:19,211 --> 01:13:22,237
Do you take advantage
of the new freedoms?

987
01:13:28,619 --> 01:13:29,984
What do you mean?

988
01:13:39,163 --> 01:13:40,926
It's something I do.

989
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:44,063
For recreation.

990
01:13:46,003 --> 01:13:47,163
That's

991
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,671
...marijuana?
- Mmm-hmm.

992
01:13:53,177 --> 01:13:55,338
You'll find you'll
need the iced tea.

993
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:01,113
Is it...

994
01:14:04,323 --> 01:14:05,813
Well, okay.

995
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,113
Maybe Rabbi Scott was right.

996
01:14:31,483 --> 01:14:32,881
Who's Rabbi Scott?

997
01:14:36,287 --> 01:14:38,118
The junior rabbi.

998
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:40,783
The junior rabbi.

999
01:14:55,172 --> 01:14:56,400
What did he say?

1000
01:14:57,376 --> 01:14:58,865
He spoke of

1001
01:15:00,845 --> 01:15:02,369
perception.

1002
01:15:04,515 --> 01:15:06,574
All my problems
are just...

1003
01:15:08,854 --> 01:15:09,979
Just a...

1004
01:15:11,856 --> 01:15:13,484
A mere...

1005
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:18,252
Is that a siren?

1006
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:20,755
No.

1007
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,234
Sometimes people
get paranoid...

1008
01:15:24,368 --> 01:15:25,893
Holy cow, that is a siren.

1009
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:32,765
Hey!

1010
01:15:34,779 --> 01:15:35,769
Hey!

1011
01:15:38,015 --> 01:15:39,005
Hey!

1012
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:40,278
Does this man live here?

1013
01:15:40,284 --> 01:15:43,048
- Sort of. He sleeps on the couch.
- This is crazy!

1014
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:45,055
I didn't know what to tell them
They asked me for my address.

1015
01:15:45,122 --> 01:15:47,421
It's just mathematics. You can't
arrest a man for mathematics.

1016
01:15:47,525 --> 01:15:49,858
I didn't know whether to tell
them here, or at the Jolly Roger.

1017
01:15:49,927 --> 01:15:51,054
Do you know this man?

1018
01:15:51,128 --> 01:15:52,858
I just figured that this would
sound better. I don't know.

1019
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:55,559
Dad, why is Uncle Arthur
in handcuffs?

1020
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:58,101
It's all a mistake. I mean,
not a mistake, a miscarriage...

1021
01:15:58,203 --> 01:16:00,033
- Hello, Mrs Samsky.
- Hello, Arthur.

1022
01:16:00,137 --> 01:16:02,072
- Does this man live here?
- He sleeps on the couch.

1023
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,402
Look. What did he do?

1024
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:05,908
- Nothing! I didn't do anything!
- Dad sleeps on a cot.

1025
01:16:05,976 --> 01:16:08,274
Sir, we picked this man
up at the North Dakota.

1026
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:11,577
- But I didn't do anything! I didn't...
- The North Dakota?

1027
01:16:11,649 --> 01:16:13,550
Solicitation Sodomy Very serious.

1028
01:16:13,618 --> 01:16:14,743
But I didn't
do anything.

1029
01:16:14,819 --> 01:16:15,912
"Sodomy"?

1030
01:16:16,887 --> 01:16:18,617
What's sodomy,
Dad?

1031
01:16:21,659 --> 01:16:23,490
What does Arthur say?

1032
01:16:25,463 --> 01:16:28,126
He says he didn't
do anything.

1033
01:16:28,233 --> 01:16:29,461
Uh-huh.

1034
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:34,595
He says he just
went in for a drink.

1035
01:16:34,672 --> 01:16:35,900
Uh-huh.

1036
01:16:39,677 --> 01:16:41,838
- Does Arthur drink?
- No.

1037
01:16:41,947 --> 01:16:43,073
Uh-huh.

1038
01:16:44,282 --> 01:16:46,341
The North Dakota.

1039
01:16:47,685 --> 01:16:48,778
Well...

1040
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:52,679
You'll need
a criminal attorney.

1041
01:16:52,791 --> 01:16:56,351
- Okay Who's...
- Ron Meshbesher.

1042
01:16:56,461 --> 01:16:58,929
- Is he good?
- Ron is very good.

1043
01:17:00,599 --> 01:17:02,362
I don't understand.

1044
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:06,136
- He goes to mixers at the Hillel House.
- Mmm.

1045
01:17:09,306 --> 01:17:12,037
- I would call Ron Meshbesher.
- Is he expensive?

1046
01:17:12,144 --> 01:17:14,805
Ron is not cheap.

1047
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,273
Yeah.

1048
01:17:17,548 --> 01:17:20,541
Oh, Sol, come in, we
could use some good news.

1049
01:17:21,987 --> 01:17:24,649
Sol's been going over
the property line issue

1050
01:17:24,722 --> 01:17:26,690
and he wouldn't go into
details, but he seems to think

1051
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:29,385
there's a nifty way
out of this.

1052
01:17:29,493 --> 01:17:31,689
Says it was pure luck
that he caught something.

1053
01:17:31,796 --> 01:17:34,390
I guess that's why you're
full partner, eh, Sol?

1054
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:57,378
- Danny's bar mitzvah is...
- This week.

1055
01:17:57,488 --> 01:18:00,548
This Shabbas?
Great, great.

1056
01:18:19,844 --> 01:18:21,675
Professor Gopnik,
Dick Dutton.

1057
01:18:21,746 --> 01:18:23,680
Heart attack.
Call back.

1058
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,020
Larry?

1059
01:18:38,462 --> 01:18:41,694
As you know, the tenure
committee meets on... What?

1060
01:18:43,201 --> 01:18:45,135
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1061
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:48,206
I'm sorry. I know
you've hit a rough patch.

1062
01:18:48,273 --> 01:18:50,069
Someone just...

1063
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,971
But I'm fine.

1064
01:18:54,311 --> 01:18:58,112
Well, as you know, the tenure
committee meets on Wednesday

1065
01:18:58,216 --> 01:19:00,775
...to make its final
determinations, so if... - Arlen,

1066
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:04,314
I am not an evil man.

1067
01:19:04,922 --> 01:19:08,086
- No, no, Larry, no, of course not.
- I am not!

1068
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:10,059
No, we don't make
moral judgments.

1069
01:19:10,127 --> 01:19:12,926
I went to the
Aster Art once.

1070
01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:14,828
I saw Swedish Reverie.

1071
01:19:14,932 --> 01:19:16,957
No, it's okay.
We don't need to know.

1072
01:19:17,068 --> 01:19:18,831
It wasn't even erotic.

1073
01:19:18,936 --> 01:19:21,905
Although it was,
in a way.

1074
01:19:21,972 --> 01:19:24,600
It's all right, really,
Larry. Believe me.

1075
01:19:26,645 --> 01:19:27,737
Yeah, okay.

1076
01:19:28,113 --> 01:19:30,774
Okay. Okay.

1077
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:35,118
So, we decide
on Wednesday.

1078
01:19:35,185 --> 01:19:37,779
So, if there's anything
that you want to

1079
01:19:37,855 --> 01:19:40,323
submit in support of
your tenure application,

1080
01:19:40,425 --> 01:19:43,087
we would need it
by Wednesday.

1081
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:44,992
Submit? What do you...

1082
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:47,587
Well, anything.
Any published work.

1083
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:51,295
Anything you've done
outside the institution.

1084
01:19:51,368 --> 01:19:54,270
Anything at all that
we should be aware of.

1085
01:19:55,306 --> 01:19:57,639
- I haven't done anything.
- Uh-huh.

1086
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:59,768
- I haven't published.
- Uh-huh.

1087
01:19:59,844 --> 01:20:02,368
- You're still getting those...
- Uh-huh.

1088
01:20:03,148 --> 01:20:07,208
- Those anonymous...
- No, no, I know. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.

1089
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:09,514
- Okay. Okay. Wednesday?
- Uh-huh.

1090
01:20:09,621 --> 01:20:13,216
Um Okay Uh...
Don't worry.

1091
01:20:13,957 --> 01:20:17,359
Doing nothing is
not bad. Ipso facto.

1092
01:20:18,662 --> 01:20:20,528
Just relax.

1093
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:23,060
Try to relax.

1094
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:28,835
Oh, my God,
Mrs. Samsky!

1095
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,238
So good.

1096
01:20:43,253 --> 01:20:45,744
Nailing it down.
So important.

1097
01:21:07,746 --> 01:21:12,011
Please. I need help. I've already
talked to the other rabbis. Please.

1098
01:21:12,751 --> 01:21:14,912
It's not about
Danny's bar mitzvah.

1099
01:21:15,019 --> 01:21:17,350
My boy, Danny.
This coming Shabbas.

1100
01:21:17,421 --> 01:21:19,355
Very joyous event.
That's all fine.

1101
01:21:19,423 --> 01:21:24,725
It's more about myself. I've
had quite a bit of tsuris lately.

1102
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:27,195
Marital problems,
professional, you name it.

1103
01:21:27,265 --> 01:21:29,061
This is not
a frivolous request.

1104
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:30,795
This is a...

1105
01:21:30,902 --> 01:21:32,631
I'm a...

1106
01:21:32,737 --> 01:21:36,104
I've tried to be a
serious man, you know?

1107
01:21:36,207 --> 01:21:39,734
Tried to do right, be a member
of the community, raise the...

1108
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:43,975
Danny, Sarah, they both
go to school, Hebrew school.

1109
01:21:44,082 --> 01:21:45,605
A good breakfast...

1110
01:21:45,716 --> 01:21:49,278
Well, Danny goes to Hebrew
school, Sarah doesn't have time.

1111
01:21:49,386 --> 01:21:52,082
She mostly
washes her hair.

1112
01:21:53,323 --> 01:21:55,314
Apparently there are
several steps involved,

1113
01:21:55,426 --> 01:21:58,328
but you don't have to tell Marshak
that, just tell him I need help.

1114
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:00,488
Please. I need help.

1115
01:22:54,786 --> 01:22:56,480
The Rabbi is busy.

1116
01:22:59,323 --> 01:23:01,121
He didn't look busy.

1117
01:23:03,394 --> 01:23:04,884
He's thinking.

1118
01:23:22,346 --> 01:23:23,574
Arthur?

1119
01:23:31,555 --> 01:23:32,750
Arthur?

1120
01:23:33,757 --> 01:23:35,247
What's wrong?

1121
01:23:35,894 --> 01:23:39,226
It'll be okay.
Arthur, we'll...

1122
01:23:39,329 --> 01:23:42,197
Don't worry, we'll get Ron
Meshbesher It'll be okay...

1123
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:49,201
Arthur!

1124
01:23:50,774 --> 01:23:52,037
Arthur!

1125
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:06,753
Arthur! You've got to
pull yourself together!

1126
01:24:06,858 --> 01:24:10,190
It's all shit, Larry!
It's all shit!

1127
01:24:10,261 --> 01:24:11,728
Arthur,
don't use that word.

1128
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:13,922
It's just fucking shit!

1129
01:24:14,032 --> 01:24:15,020
Arthur.

1130
01:24:15,099 --> 01:24:17,396
Look at all that
Hashem has given you!

1131
01:24:17,467 --> 01:24:20,631
What has he given me?
He hasn't given me shit!

1132
01:24:20,738 --> 01:24:24,697
Arthur. What do I have?
I live at the Jolly Roger.

1133
01:24:24,775 --> 01:24:28,371
You have a family!
You have a job!

1134
01:24:28,445 --> 01:24:31,744
Hashem hasn't given me shit
He hasn't given me bupkes!

1135
01:24:31,815 --> 01:24:34,784
It's not fair to blame
Hashem, Arthur. Please.

1136
01:24:34,886 --> 01:24:36,911
Sometimes...
Please calm down.

1137
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:39,149
Sometimes you
have to help yourself.

1138
01:24:41,492 --> 01:24:43,653
Hashem hasn't given me shit.

1139
01:24:45,063 --> 01:24:47,895
Now I can't even
play cards.

1140
01:24:54,972 --> 01:24:57,635
It's okay,
it's okay.

1141
01:24:57,774 --> 01:25:00,505
It's okay, it's okay.

1142
01:25:25,802 --> 01:25:27,202
Is this it?

1143
01:25:27,805 --> 01:25:30,671
Yeah, I think.
Yeah, there.

1144
01:25:41,551 --> 01:25:45,010
Look, this should help
you get back on your feet.

1145
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:51,653
Oh, my God
Where did you get this?

1146
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,219
- It doesn't matter.
- This is a lot of money.

1147
01:25:53,631 --> 01:25:56,155
- It should get you started.
- I know, but this is a lot of money.

1148
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:57,994
- You sure you don't need it?
- Arthur, I'm fine.

1149
01:25:58,069 --> 01:25:59,695
Come on, get in
When you're settled,

1150
01:25:59,804 --> 01:26:01,498
let me know how
to get in touch.

1151
01:26:01,572 --> 01:26:03,471
You're sure?

1152
01:26:03,541 --> 01:26:04,905
It's fine.

1153
01:26:22,326 --> 01:26:24,988
Larry. I'm sorry.

1154
01:26:26,096 --> 01:26:27,496
What I said last night.

1155
01:26:27,564 --> 01:26:29,260
I know.

1156
01:26:29,367 --> 01:26:30,731
It's okay.

1157
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:37,034
Goodbye!

1158
01:26:46,551 --> 01:26:48,576
There's another Jew, son!

1159
01:27:05,569 --> 01:27:09,404
Were we out at
the pool last night?

1160
01:27:12,109 --> 01:27:13,202
Yeah.

1161
01:27:15,445 --> 01:27:16,777
I'm sorry.

1162
01:27:25,256 --> 01:27:26,746
It's Shabbas.

1163
01:27:30,661 --> 01:27:32,322
Give me that fucker.

1164
01:30:32,176 --> 01:30:36,010
I'm sorry that... That things
have been so hard for us.

1165
01:30:37,681 --> 01:30:39,081
It's okay.

1166
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:42,811
Sy had so much respect for you, Larry.

1167
01:30:44,521 --> 01:30:47,286
He wrote letters to
the tenure committee.

1168
01:30:59,436 --> 01:31:01,371
Jesus Christ.

1169
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:05,970
...taking your place
as a member of our tribe.

1170
01:31:06,042 --> 01:31:08,170
Now, you will go
and see Rabbi Marshak.

1171
01:31:08,279 --> 01:31:12,045
Afterwards, you will celebrate in a
reception downstairs in Schanfield Hall.

1172
01:31:12,149 --> 01:31:16,346
And then, you will be a member of
B'Nai Avraham and the Nation of Israel.

1173
01:31:16,453 --> 01:31:20,652
Danny Gopnik, the Sisterhood makes
a gift to you of this Kiddush cup,

1174
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:24,990
so that you will remember this blessed
day on the next Shabbas and the next,

1175
01:31:25,061 --> 01:31:27,622
and on every Shabbas
of a long and fruitful life.

1176
01:31:27,698 --> 01:31:32,828
And until that wonderful day when you
stand under the chuppah, we say amen.

1177
01:33:12,136 --> 01:33:15,127
When the truth

1178
01:33:16,506 --> 01:33:18,099
is found

1179
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:21,501
to be lies...

1180
01:33:30,488 --> 01:33:33,354
...and all the hope

1181
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:37,525
within you dies...

1182
01:33:46,837 --> 01:33:48,202
Then what?

1183
01:33:50,774 --> 01:33:53,435
Grace Slick.

1184
01:33:54,878 --> 01:33:57,143
Marty Balin.

1185
01:33:58,349 --> 01:34:00,715
Paul Kantner.

1186
01:34:02,185 --> 01:34:04,051
Jorma...

1187
01:34:05,021 --> 01:34:06,216
Kaukonen.

1188
01:34:06,556 --> 01:34:08,046
...something.

1189
01:34:09,059 --> 01:34:12,460
These are the members

1190
01:34:13,663 --> 01:34:15,996
of the Airplane.

1191
01:34:16,065 --> 01:34:18,056
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

1192
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:51,690
Be a good boy.

1193
01:34:57,608 --> 01:34:59,542
Danny was magnificent.

1194
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:01,766
Oh.

1195
01:35:02,378 --> 01:35:04,108
Thank you, Arlen.

1196
01:35:04,215 --> 01:35:06,774
Mazel tov.
It was wonderful.

1197
01:35:07,384 --> 01:35:09,944
Yes, it was. Thank you.

1198
01:35:10,054 --> 01:35:12,578
Such a time of nachas.

1199
01:35:12,689 --> 01:35:15,453
He's your youngest,
you have to savor it.

1200
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,119
I do.

1201
01:35:18,194 --> 01:35:19,422
I will.

1202
01:35:20,396 --> 01:35:23,422
- Well, see you at the staff caf.
- Yes.

1203
01:35:23,533 --> 01:35:24,796
I, uh...

1204
01:35:25,603 --> 01:35:26,967
Just, um...

1205
01:35:27,971 --> 01:35:31,908
I shouldn't tell you this,
I'm not telling you officially.

1206
01:35:31,975 --> 01:35:35,639
The tenure candidates aren't
notified till Thursday.

1207
01:35:38,215 --> 01:35:39,306
Yes?

1208
01:35:40,216 --> 01:35:42,047
You'll be very pleased.

1209
01:35:44,654 --> 01:35:48,454
- Thank you, Arlen.
- I didn't say anything Mazel tov.

1210
01:36:43,146 --> 01:36:44,341
Fagle.

1211
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:26,350
There's a tornado warning
from the weather service.

1212
01:37:26,422 --> 01:37:31,019
Mr. Turchik has decided to move us
into the basement of the synagogue.

1213
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:35,091
We will form two lines.

1214
01:38:30,921 --> 01:38:34,253
That fucking flag's gonna
rip right off the flagpole!

1215
01:38:48,971 --> 01:38:49,996
Hello?

1216
01:38:50,807 --> 01:38:52,900
- Larry?
- Yes?

1217
01:38:52,975 --> 01:38:54,568
Hi, Len Shapiro.

1218
01:38:54,645 --> 01:38:57,579
Oh
Hello, Dr. Shapiro.

1219
01:38:57,648 --> 01:38:59,912
Listen,
mazel tov on Danny.

1220
01:38:59,983 --> 01:39:01,779
Yes, thank you.

1221
01:39:01,851 --> 01:39:06,185
Listen, could you come by to
discuss these x-ray results?

1222
01:39:10,527 --> 01:39:11,755
Hello?

1223
01:39:14,198 --> 01:39:15,256
Yes?

1224
01:39:15,332 --> 01:39:17,663
Larry, could you come in to
discuss these x-ray results?

1225
01:39:17,768 --> 01:39:20,100
You remember the
x- rays we took?

1226
01:39:22,338 --> 01:39:24,306
We can't discuss them
over the phone?

1227
01:39:25,375 --> 01:39:27,434
I think we'd be more
comfortable in person.

1228
01:39:28,511 --> 01:39:30,139
Can you come in?

1229
01:39:31,481 --> 01:39:33,472
- When?
- Now.

1230
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:36,542
Now is good. I've cleared some time now.

1231
01:39:44,795 --> 01:39:47,194
Hey, Fagle!

1232
01:39:50,367 --> 01:39:52,163
Fagle, I got your...
