We leave at 2:45 p.m.
On the dot. Can't be late.

8
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,651

Can I help you, sir?

14
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,664
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,167

16
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:48,836

17
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,504
Nobody. Just me.

18
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,174
Boy, I can't take responsibility ...

19
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,093

traveling 3,500 miles alone.

20
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,345
I ... I ... I paid for this here
ticket, and it says ...

21
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,473
that you have to take me
to Seattle.

22
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,184
Don't you be smarting off
to me, boy.

23
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,312
With all due respect, sir,
I believe I earned the right.

24
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,272
I may have left my eyes
on Omaha Beach,

25
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,441
but I ain't asking no charity
from Uncle Sam.

26
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,776
I got a job waiting
for me in Seattle.

27
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,446

45

a mean jazz piano.

Sir.

00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,482
Boy, are you blind?

50
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:35,192
Yes, sir. Since I was seven.

51
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,654
Well, let me help you out then.

52
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,865
This is a country band.

53
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,242

58

Uh, you know,
about fallin' in love ...

knock you around ...

and then the pressures
of the world on you so tough.

61
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,133
It ... It makes you
feel small.

62
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:00,634
You want to give your soul to God.

63

You might as well.
Your ass belongs to Him.

64
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,230

65
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,690

Okay. Come on in.

I'll show him inside ...

Don't mess with me, Q.
He can come in, but not you.

I can see that,
but mama ain't finished yet.

179
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:21,348
For the first time anywhere,

180
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,393
let's hear it for "The McSon Trio!"

181
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:27,062
♪ A buzzard took the monkey
for a ride in the air ♪

182
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:30,232
♪ The monkey thought that
everything was on the square ♪

183
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:31,775
Ray, when you coming out?

184
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,110
In a minute.

185
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:37,072
Mama's got some more blackberry 
cobbler for you, baby.

186
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,824
Damn.

189
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,675
Marlene, if you're gonna
send us out on tour,

190
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,344
we're gonna need
more than $5 a day.

191
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,471
How come we can't get paid
after each gig?

192
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,723
Because you boys will spend
everything you make.

193
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,684
The club sends the checks
to me, so as I can bank them.

194
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:08,145
I just want to see
my own checks, that's all.

195
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:11,106
You don't see, Ray.
You're blind, baby.

196
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,858
Or did you forget?

197
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:16,946
Now, you want to go out on your 
own and see how well you do?

198
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,748
Ray! Hey, Marlene, where's Ray?

199
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,751
He's in the back bedroom.
And wipe your feet.

200
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,427
Ray, uh, six-nine, where you at?
Six-nine. Six-nine.

201
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,098
Lionel Hampton just asked me
to go on the road with him, man!

202
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,724
Lionel Hampton, man!

203
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,601
- Sure he did.
- Then why you still here?

204
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:51,647
And dig this: His wife, she 
kicked me off the tour bus.

205
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,567
Told me to come back when I 
started shaving. You believe that?

206
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,778
Uh ... uh, Seven-oh, could you do me a 
favor, man, and close that bag for me?

207
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,156
What's wrong? You got two hands.
You can close it yourself.

208
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,991
I got two feet, too.
Could you close it?

209
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,659
I got it.

210
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,288
Excuse me, sir!

211
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:10,875
Man, we're gonna be late.

212
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,627
I got to get my own place, Gossie.

213
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:17,631
Why? I mean,
you got free rent right now.

214
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,800
Like hell it's free rent.

215
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,139
Oh, come on, Ray.

216
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,141
Why you gonna mess
with a good thing?

217
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,477
All I'm saying is you keep
layin' that pipe with Marlene,

218
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,520
and I bet you she's gonna
make us all rich.

219
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,397

of the Yakima Valley,
The McSon Trio!

227
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:07,681
They'll be back right here,

228
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:10,017
same time, same place, next week.

229
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:17,858
Hey, baby, you sound more like
Nat than the King himself.

230
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:20,820
What's your name?

231
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:21,904
Ray Robinson.

232
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,280
Ray Robinson?

233
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,866
I'm Jack Lauderdale,
Swing Time Records.

234
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,911
Oh, hey ... hey, hey, Jack!
How you doing, man?

235
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:30,162
Good. Oh, good.

236
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:31,872
How about us makin'
a record together?

237
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,999
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hell, yeah! Let's do that.

238
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,251
Can I help you?

239
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:36,377
I don't think so.

240
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,712
We're just talking
a little business.

241
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,966
Then you need to talk to me,
'cause I'm his manager.

242
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:43,759
Whichever way the wind blows.

243
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:44,969
It's blowing.

244
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,595
Jack Lauderdale,
Swing Time Records.

245
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,556
- Marlene Andres.
- Marlene?

246
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,099
- Gossie McGee.
- Gossie McGee.

247
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,392
Great set, baby.

248
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,435
We're going to talk
with Mr. Lauderdale here.

249
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,812
Come on, Jack. I'm buying.

250
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,313
I'm coming in, uh, to talk to him.

251
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:58,440
You are doing a fabulous job!

252
00:14:58,524 --> 00:14:59,567
Yes, man.

253
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,610
Eh, look, let's talk to him
about this record.

254
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:03,779
Hey, no, no, we're gonna
let Marlene handle that.

255
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:05,781
You get Oberon
to call you a cab, all right.

256
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:07,408
Great set, Ray.

257
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:09,743
Goss!

258
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,912
Hey, daddy-o, want a smoke?

259
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,456
I got some gage, fresh off the boat.

260
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,958
It's clean and seedless.

261
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,793
So that's how it is, huh?

262
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:20,796
You keep me high
while they talk the business?

263
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,673
I ain't the one playing you, man.

264
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,094
Oberon, listen ...

265
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:30,764
You know, Marlene and Gossie are the 
ones running the game on you, Ray.

266
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:31,891
What?

267
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,477
They sliced up the pie
the first night you played.

268
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,270
35 percent off the top.

269
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,397
Plus Gossie's
double scale as leader.

270
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,107
Leader?
If anybody's leading the band,

271
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,359
I'm the one that's the leader.

272
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,195
Forget the bo' humps.
You know what?

273
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,613
I ... I'm ... I'm gonna go
my own way.

274
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,573
Who's gonna book your gigs?

275
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,617
Marlene's got you locked up.

276
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,453

her golden goose.

Jack's card.

283
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,470
I got his number at the hotel.

284
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,269
Come on, Q.
It's not that complicated.

285
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:18,646
Now let's just play it again.

286
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,564
That's a B flat, C 7, scale it up,

Yeah, nigger! Yeah, that's it.

289
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:31,659
Ray, what did I tell you
about cookin' in the dark?

290
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,369
Are you tryin'
to burn the house down?

291
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,996
Think about it, Marlene. Uh ... uh, 
what do I need the light for?

292
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,832
Well, you don't need
to be cookin' anyway.

293
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,458
We brought you
takeout from Oscar's.

294
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:40,584
Well, get your money back.

295
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:42,002
I got fried chicken right here.

296
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,379
Come on, Seven-oh, try this.

297
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:44,964
Yeah! About time.

298
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,634
Hey, that's home-cooked,
right there.

299
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,844
Mmm, no, thank you.

300
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,345
This chicken is the mostest, huh.

301
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:53,681
Just needs a little hot sauce
and it'll be perfect.

302
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,766
Yeah. So, what did
Jack Lauderdale have to say?

303
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,434
Oh, I clocked him
comin' out the gate.

304
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:58,769
He's a two-bit hustler.

305
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:00,020
Oh, I see.

306
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,606
Yeah, turns out the only hit
that Swing Time ever had ...

307
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,859
was Open the Door, Richard,
which was a joke record.

308
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,819
Uh ... uh ... uh, what about him
recordin' me?

309
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,238
Oh, he'll record you,
if we pay the freight.

310
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,031
Scratch a liar, find a thief.

311
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:13,659
What's that supposed to mean?

312
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:14,952
This.

313
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:17,580
You see I saw
Jack Lauderdale tonight,

314
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:19,707
and he gave me a $500
advance on my record.

315
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,042
He also said he'll put me
on the road with Lowell Fulson ...

316
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,627
and pay me three times
what you pay.

317
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,837
Now, that's a lie!

318
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,340
Hey, no way he's not gonna put some 
blind man on the road. Think about it.

319
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:30,342
I mean, you ... you need
watchin' out for.

320
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:32,636
And he ain't got the time to 
look after you the way I do.

321
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,139
Is that what you've been doing, 
Gossie? Watchin' out for me?

322
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,057
Is that why you get
paid double what I do?

323
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:39,768
Who told you that?

324
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:40,895
It's true, ain't it?

325
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,980
You two have been
gaming me since I got here.

326
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,024
Ray, baby, listen ...
I ain't listening to you!

327
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,485
Ray, I've ... I've been meaning 
to talk to you about that.

328
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,612
Then why aren't you talkin'?

329
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:54,241
Um, look, Ray, Ray,
let's not do nothin' stupid.

330
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,076
I might be blind,
but I ain't stupid!

331
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,828
Q., get my bag from upstairs.

332
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,038
- What?
- Get it!

333
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,581
- Wha ... right now?
- Now.

334
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,917
Ray, man, we done been
through a whole lot.

335
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,711
Ray, now wait a minute.
I can explain everything.

336
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,713
Think about what you're doing.

337
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:09,632
Ray, Ray, now you're makin'
a big mistake.

338
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,717
That clown is spoutin'
promises that he can't keep.

339
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:13,552
You'd be a fool to follow him.

340
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:14,929
Ray, Ray, we'll make a new deal!

341
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,138
Whatever makes you happy!

342
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:18,140
The deal is
you can lay the pipe now.

343
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:21,644
You'll break your neck going down 
these stairs by yourself. Hang on.

344
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,145
Oh, man.

345
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:26,982
Ray, I ain't never seen you do 
nothing like that, man. Never.

346
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:28,776
That ain't nothing, Seven-oh.

347
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:43,582
Stop cheating, Ray.

348
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,044
George, you can't catch me.
Come on.

349
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:48,462
Aretha!

350
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,464
Come on, George.

351
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:53,050
Aretha Robinson,
have you lost your mind?

352
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:56,428
Eula, you promised to split every 
wash basket with me, fair and square!

353
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:57,596
And I did!

354
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,764
Hell, you did!

355
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:00,933
You charge white folks
one thing and pay me another.

356
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,434
Now who's gonna wash these?

357
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:03,978
You can. Now pay me my money!

358
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:09,567
Okay, I'm a-giving you
your two little dollars.

359
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,777
But don't you be expectin'
no more work out of me!

360
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:13,279
I got all I need out of you.

361
00:19:13,404 --> 00:19:14,864
Ray and George, come on!

362
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,532
That's right. 
Get out of my yard ...

363
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,367
and don't y'all never come back!

364
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:24,039
Y'all got to learn
to read and write real good,

365
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:26,876
so you never have to work
for people like that.

366
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,669
Scratch a liar, find a thief.

367
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:29,712
Understand?

368
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:30,921
Yes, Mama.

369
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:46,520
Smell that, Ray.
Smell the success.

370
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,230
We're in LA, man,

371
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:50,566
the place where the Negro
comes to spread his wings.

372
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,068
You ... you know, man, I know
my ears ain't deceivin' me.

373
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,153
Is that Art Tatum?

374
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,863
It sure is, baby.
You want to meet him?

375
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,616
I ... I can't meet him.
A-Art Tatum is the most.

376
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:08,334
So, Ray, we got to talk about 
your name, man: Robinson.

377
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:11,295
Sugar Ray got the Robinson
franchise all sewed up.

378
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:15,049
So I'm thinkin' we go with
your middle name, Charles.

379
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:16,967
As in, Ray Charles.

380
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:18,761
I don't care
what you call me, man,

381
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,638
just as long as my name's
on the record.

382
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,097
But we're gonna toast to that.

383
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,474
Hey, what's the haps, Jack?

384
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,184
Oh, my goodness.
Give me some skin.

385
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,311
What's up, baby?
How you doin'?

386
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:30,981
Lowell Fulson, meet your new
piano player: Ray Charles.

387
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:33,609
Ray Charles, the blind sensation.

388
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:37,488
Ow! Damn! I'm gonna use that
on the album cover.

389
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,989
He's really the sensation.

390
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:40,908
I ... I love your music,
Mr. Fulson.

391
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,368
Uh, the man's got taste.

392
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,745
Hey, and the man ain't
been on the road ...

393
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:47,039
with a band before,
so now you take care of him.

394
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,457
Like my own brother.

395
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,295
Ray.

396
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,297
I'm gonna be right back.

397
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:56,423
All right.

398
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,593
Yeah, you got the one
on the left.

399
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,428
Look here,
let me do the talking.

400
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,750
Don't go inside that place.

401
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,294
You know what Mama said.

402
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,838
Go home
and don't tell Mama nothin'.

403
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,715
Go, George.

404
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:44,013
George, get out of here!

405
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,625
Hey, boy, who let you in?

406
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,002
You must be Aretha's son, huh?

407
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:17,296
Yes, sir. Ray Charles Robinson.

408
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:20,508
I've been seeing you
sneakin' around here.

409
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,510
You like the piano, huh?

410
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,137
Come on, you want
to learn how to play?

411
00:22:25,221 --> 00:22:26,514
Come on over here.

412
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,307
Let me show you how to play.
Come on.

413
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,601
I'm gonna teach you how to play.

414
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,604
What we'll do, I'm gonna teach
you three notes, right?

415
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,773
This is the first note,
right here.

416
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:38,442
Play that.

417
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,946
And here's the second note,
right here.

418
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:44,365
Play that.

419
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:47,701
Here's the third note.

420
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:52,039
Now, here's the way it goes.

421
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,707
Listen. Listen closely, now.

422
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:58,796
Play that.

423
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:01,715
Good!

424
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,635
Try the other notes.

425
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:14,937
Every club we hit,

426
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,481
it's your responsibility
to rehearse the band.

427
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,608
These are some lazy-ass bastards,

428
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:21,986
so you gotta make sure
that they don't slough off.

429
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:24,530
You gotta be ready
and dressed to open the show.

430
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,949
Now, Lowell likes to take
a nap before he goes on.

431
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:30,077
You just do your thing
until he feels like comin' out.

432
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:33,080
And when Lowell's playin',
you keep the band sharp.

433
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:34,123
Uh ... uh, just one thing.

434
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,124
What?

435
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:37,334
Did Jack tell you that
I have to be paid in singles?

436
00:23:38,463 --> 00:23:40,847

Why do they call me Fathead?

443
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:07,072
Nah, you don't want to hear.

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,564

00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:18,305
Say, Ray, we'll be in here
for a little while.

478
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,142
Use the women's can,
down there on your right.

479
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:22,768

00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:50,713
Yeah, I must have slipped
on the wet.

484
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:51,881
There's a pipe broke.

485
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:53,507
There's water everywhere.
You see it?

486
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:55,509
Let's go, man. Close the door.

487
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:56,969
All right, quit playing, Ray.

488
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,513
We'll be in here a while.
Now go on now!

489
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:08,272
Where you from, Ray?

490
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,565
North Florida.

491
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:11,484
Oh, North Florida boy.

492
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:13,194
Your people still down there?

493
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,487
No.

494
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:16,822
All right.

495
00:28:17,323 --> 00:28:18,824
Hey, uh, pardon me for askin',

496
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:20,826
but how do you 
get around so good ...

497
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,786
without a cane or a dog?

498
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:26,457
How do you get around so good
without a cane or dog?

499
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,667
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

500
00:28:30,753 --> 00:28:32,838
My ears got to be my eyes, man. 
Its ...

501
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:34,882
Everything sounds different.

502
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:37,051
You know that's why
I wear hard-soled shoes,

503
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,094
so I can hear my footsteps
echo off the wall.

504
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:42,389
So when I pass by an open 
doorway, the sound changes.

505
00:28:42,515 --> 00:28:43,933
Wow. That's cool.

506
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:47,978
You know you got to learn pretty quick 
if you want to get around on your own.

507
00:28:48,062 --> 00:28:49,188
Yeah.

508
00:28:49,814 --> 00:28:52,066
You know, during the war,
there was a whole lot ...

509
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:54,360
I had to learn fast,
or I wouldn't be here.

510
00:28:56,946 --> 00:28:59,323
Seein' that much death
ain't natural.

511
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,536
Yeah, seein' death ain't natural.

512
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:10,000
Boys, get from 'round that still.

513
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:11,460
Y'all know better than that.

514
00:29:11,544 --> 00:29:12,962
Come on, catch me.

515
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,511
Stay from 'round this fire
and get clean.

516
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:22,179
Dinner will be ready soon.

517
00:29:22,263 --> 00:29:23,722
Hear me, Ray?

518
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:26,767
I got you. I got you.

519
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:28,227
No, you didn't. You missed me.

520
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,603
Stop cheatin', Ray.

521
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:32,273
Okay, you got me.

522
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:34,108
But I got you back.

523
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,901
I'm not playin' no more.

524
00:29:36,152 --> 00:29:37,319
Sissy!

525
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:41,407
Come on, Ray.
Let's go swimmin'.

526
00:29:43,576 --> 00:29:46,078
Let's go swim in Mama's washtub.

527
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:49,248
Ray, come on, Ray, play with me.

528
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:51,625
You better get down
before Mama sees you.

529
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,169
I'm a giant!

530
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:58,757
Some giant.

531
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:02,636
Come on, George.
I ain't playin' this game.

532
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,181
That ain't funny.

533
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:09,810
Boys, I got some field peas
and rice cooking.

534
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:12,480
And there's that smothered
corn left from yesterday.

535
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:16,525
And if you're real good, I might 
have two pieces of peach cobbler.

536
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:19,987
Ray, didn't I tell you
to get in this house?

537
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:24,992
Dear God, no!

538
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:30,915
That's Aretha's boy!

539
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,374
Breathe, baby, breathe.

540
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:35,836
Just breathe, baby, breathe.
Let it out!

541
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,713
Let it out, please!

542
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,215
Breathe for your mama, now.

543
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:40,633
Come on, George.

544
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:43,010
Why didn't you do somethin'?

545
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:44,929
Why didn't you call me?

546
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:48,182
Help us, Lord!

547
00:30:48,224 --> 00:30:49,850
The Lord done took him home.

548
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:00,694
All right.

549
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,531
Food and piss stop. Open it up.

550
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,537
The food is hot.
You've got 45 minutes.

551
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,997
- I could eat a horse. 
- Where's it?

552
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,166
Follow your nose. Right over there.

553
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,043
Wilbur.

554
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:17,169
What?

555
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:19,547
45 minutes ain't enough time.

556
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,090
We need more than that, Jack.

557
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:22,758
Not to eat, you don't.

558
00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:24,927
Now if you got other business,
you better choose,

559
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,512
because this bus
is rollin' on time.

560
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:29,849
Come on, Mercedes got
a washroom in the back.

561
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:32,726
And you, you can smell it.

562
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:35,437
Jeff.

563
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:36,522
Yes, sir?

564
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:37,857
Uh, could you help me in there?

565
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,316
Sure thing, Ray.

566
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,401
Hey, Mercedes.

567
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:43,279
Hey, baby. I hope you wiped 
your feet before you came in here.

568
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:44,780
- There you go. Come on.
- Take that.

569
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:46,740
The bathroom's right there
in front of you.

570
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:47,783
Okay.

571
00:31:47,825 --> 00:31:49,076
You want me to fix you a plate?

572
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,452
Uh, no, I'm ... I'm fine.

573
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:51,912
All right.

574
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:53,873
Sweet potato pie it is.

575
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:56,417
Whoo, let's go, man.

576
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,252
That was a long bus ride, 
wasn't it?

577
00:31:58,335 --> 00:31:59,420
Oh, come on, man.

578
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:02,590
Hey, man!
The can's down the hall.

579
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:04,550
I know where the can is.
What y'all doing?

580
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,260
Do yourself a favor and leave.

581
00:32:06,302 --> 00:32:08,179
I'll leave when
I'm gettin' ready to leave.

582
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,763
Come on, Fathead, I want in.

583
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:11,557
This ain't no weed, Ray.

584
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,642
And we ain't snorting no bitch.

585
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:14,935
This is boy.

586
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:17,480
Boy'll make your ass
null and void.

587
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:19,106
So get on out of here, man.

588
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,025
Null and void, just like my life.

589
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:22,735
I'll be right at home.

590
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:24,487
Look, I ain't gonna
wait all night.

591
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:26,280
Hell, it's his funeral, man.

592
00:32:28,324 --> 00:32:30,367
Ray, let's go get 
something to eat.

593
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:32,036
I'll leave when I get a taste.

594
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,287
Ray, what you gonna do, man?

595
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,789
This train's pullin' out, brother.

596
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:36,707
I ain't having nothin'
to do with this.

597
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,459
- I warned you, Ray.
- Come on, man.

598
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:39,752
I been warned.

599
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:41,086
Sit down, Ray. Right there.

600
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,671
I'm gonna take you
on a little ride.

601
00:32:42,755 --> 00:32:45,424
It'll cost you, though.
You got some cash?

602
00:32:45,508 --> 00:32:46,926
Will this do?

603
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:48,677
That'll do.

604
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,807
Where you been?
Where them other fools?

605
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:54,350
Come on, get it while it's hot!

606
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:58,020
You're going to feel
a little pinch.

607
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,316
I ain't givin' up on you, boy.

608
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,277
Feel it, baby?

609
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:08,239
Just take the ride.

610
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:11,200
It's better than sex.

611
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:13,911

00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:15,783
No, I don't like it. It stings.

635
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:17,326
Boy, get up here.

636
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,830
I paid a whole dollar for it.
It better work.

637
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:23,374
Now hold up your head,
like the doctor says.

638
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:25,417
This is gonna make you feel better.

639
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,007
Ray, come on in for dinner.

640
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:34,385
And stop rubbin' those eyes.

641
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:48,357
Ray, I won't beat around
the bush with you.

642
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,692
You're goin' blind.

643
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:53,154
The doctor's sayin' there's nothing they 
can do, so we got to do it ourselves.

644
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:54,280
Yes, ma'am, I know, but ...

645
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:55,322
Stop it.

646
00:35:55,364 --> 00:35:56,949
Stop it right now.

647
00:35:57,032 --> 00:35:58,951
We ain't got no time
for no tears.

648
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:00,661
Ain't nobody gonna
have no pity on you ...

649
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,037
just 'cause you're goin' blind.

650
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:03,289
Now wipe them eyes.

651
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:04,748
Yes, ma'am.

652
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,044
Okay, I'll show you
how to do something once.

653
00:36:09,128 --> 00:36:10,754
I'll help you if you mess up twice.

654
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:12,506
But the third time,
you're on your own,

655
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,967
'cause that's the way
it is in the world.

656
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,510

00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:21,599
Remember, you goin' blind,
but you ain't stupid.

658
00:36:23,726 --> 00:36:25,269
Remember how many stairs
there were?

659
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:26,687
Four.

660
00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:30,232
Good. You're gonna have to learn
how to use your memory.

661
00:36:30,316 --> 00:36:31,484
Now turn around.

662
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:33,486
I want you
to hold out your hands,

663
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:36,489

00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,701

It's a shame, Jimmy.

699
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:01,675
You're just gonna
piss this right up your arm.

700
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:04,303
You don't tell me
what to do with my money.

701
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,349
All right, come on. Step up.
The $1 sensation.

702
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:15,356
You wanna keep counting?

703
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,191
What's the matter with you, boy?

704
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:18,651
$50 ain't good enough for you?

705
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:20,820
That ain't $50. Keep counting.

706
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:24,698
I guess you want charity, since 
that record of yours ain't selling.

707
00:39:27,785 --> 00:39:29,245
Get him off my back!

708
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,709
Break it up!

709
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,545
What the hell's going on in here?

710
00:39:38,087 --> 00:39:40,923
The blind sensation don't like
the money I'm trying to pay him!

711
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,049
He's cheating me! I quit!

712
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:43,801
Oh, you lying son of a bitch!

713
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:46,220
Don't be fighting nobody
that can see!

714
00:39:46,262 --> 00:39:49,014
Listen, I ain't runnnin' around 
lookin' for singles for this chump!

715
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:50,182
There's $50 here, Ray.

716
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:51,225
You see that, fool?

717
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:54,145
Shut up, Wilbur! Ray, from now on,
I'll handle your pay myself.

718
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:55,187
I'm tired of this!

719
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:57,022
I'll tell Jack to
find you somebody else!

720
00:39:57,106 --> 00:39:58,315
You sure? It's cold out there.

721
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:00,401
Don't worry about me,
I can take care of myself.

722
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:02,653
- Ray!
- Damn it, Wilbur!

723
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:03,737
Let him go!

724
00:40:03,821 --> 00:40:05,322
What we gonna do now?

725
00:40:13,122 --> 00:40:16,834
"After the death of Moses, the
Lord spake unto Joshua saying:

726
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:19,295
Moses my servant is dead.

727
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:21,839
Now therefore arise.
Go over to Jordan.

728
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,048
Be not afraid,

729
00:40:23,132 --> 00:40:25,217
For the Lord thy God is with thee."

730
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:26,760
Mr. Charles.

731
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,596
Who is it?

732
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:30,389
Mr. Charles,
my name is Ahmet Ertegun.

733
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:32,057
May I have a moment of your time?

734
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,688
What do you want, man?
I'm at church.

735
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:40,065
I'm sorry. I'll come back later.

736
00:40:40,191 --> 00:40:42,234
You're here now. What do you want?

737
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,654
My company, Atlantic Records,
has acquired ...

738
00:40:45,738 --> 00:40:47,907
your contract from Swing Time.

739
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:50,117
I'd like to discuss your future.

740
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:53,037
Hold on. Don't jive me now.
I ain't for sale.

741
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:54,747
May I sit down?

742
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,376
You see, Mr. Charles,

743
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,213
Jack Lauderdale has found himself,

744
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:04,465
shall we say, a little overextended,

745
00:41:04,924 --> 00:41:07,718
and has had to
unload some of his talent.

746
00:41:07,802 --> 00:41:09,762
When your name
came up, I jumped at ...

747
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:11,764
the chance to work with you.
I'm a big fan.

748
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:13,724
What if I want to go
to another company?

749
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:16,227
There's a guy out there right now 
that is willing to pay me ...

750
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,646
seven cents a record.
Can you do that?

751
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:21,816
Man, I could promise you
15 cents a record,

752
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:26,111
but you won't get it any more 
than he'll pay you seven.

753
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:30,991
What I will do is promise you
five cents a record ...

754
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,494
and pay you five cents
a record.

755
00:41:34,245 --> 00:41:37,498
If you think pennies,
Mr. Charles, you get pennies.

756
00:41:38,374 --> 00:41:40,126
You think dollars,

757
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:42,711
you get dollars.

758
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:47,466
I like how you put
things together, man.

759
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:49,468
Ahem, you know what?

760
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:52,471
Omelet, you're all right with me.

761
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:54,098
- Ahmet.
- Ahmet.

762
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,349
What kind of name is that?

763
00:41:55,391 --> 00:41:56,642
I'm Turkish.

764
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:57,935
Well, you know what?

765
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,896
I guess Jack Lauderdale's bad 
luck is my good fortune.

766
00:42:01,063 --> 00:42:04,108
I knew that Atlantic Records
was bigger than Swing Time.

767
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:06,735
You guys do good music.
I dig Atlantic.

768
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:08,279
You could have fooled me.

769
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:11,031
Well, you know, I gotta keep 
my eye on you city boys.

770
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:13,451
Down home,
we call it "country dumb."

771
00:42:15,578 --> 00:42:17,413

Okay, I'll talk to him.

00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:09,590
All right, fellas, that's a cut.

You either sound original,

00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:19,767
Ahmet, what'd you think of that?

791
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:23,062
Ray, I want to tell you something, 
and I don't want you to take it wrong.

792
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:24,438
Then give it to me right.

793
00:43:24,522 --> 00:43:27,942
I signed you because I sensed
something special in you ...

794
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:31,195
not because you sound like
Nat Cole or Charles Brown.

795
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:33,113
I thought you like what I do.

796
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:35,116
We ... we love the timbre
of your voice,

797
00:43:35,157 --> 00:43:37,409
we like your virtuosity,
your energy ...

798
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:38,744
But not my music.

799
00:43:38,828 --> 00:43:40,246
Come on, man, I didn't say that.

800
00:43:40,746 --> 00:43:42,748
Ahmet, this is what I do, man.

801
00:43:42,832 --> 00:43:44,959
I gotta make a living.
This is what the people want.

802
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:46,627
I don't know no other way.

803
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,462
We got to help you find one.

804
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:50,840
Look, let's try a little
change of pace, okay?

805
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:52,299
You're familiar with stride piano?

806
00:43:52,383 --> 00:43:55,678
You kidding me, man? The man who I 
learned the piano from is a stride player.

807
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:58,764
Okay, I got a song.
It's called "The Mess Around".

808
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:00,683
"The Mess Around."
Cute title. Who wrote it?

809
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:02,143
I did.

810
00:44:02,393 --> 00:44:03,811
Ah, you wrote it.

811
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:04,895
Yeah.

812
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:06,647
Well, sing it to me, man.

813
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:08,107
- Sing it?
- Yeah.

814
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,817
It ain't like
I can read the lyrics.

815
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,486
Okay.
Well, it's the key of G.

816
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:13,988
Okay. Key of G.

817
00:44:15,156 --> 00:44:16,115
Uh-huh.

818
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:17,950
Yeah.

819
00:44:18,117 --> 00:44:20,953
Yeah, but it's a kind of
Pete Johnson thing.

00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:35,653
Great, Ray!

846
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:36,862
Unbelievable!

847
00:45:36,946 --> 00:45:38,030
Who's that?

848
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:41,242
Ray, I want you to meet
my new partner, Jerry.

849
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:42,868
Mr. Ray Charles, Jerry Wexler.

850
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:43,953
Hey.

851
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:47,081
Don't worry, Ray. I'm going to 
step back, I'm gonna watch,

852
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:49,583
I'm gonna learn how to produce 
a record. I'm in awe.

853
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:50,876
That was out of sight.

854
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,753
That's some running
and riffing, man!

855
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:54,755
Well, this'll make you shout, man.

856
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:05,599
We're listening to that
new recording, Mess Around ...

857
00:46:05,683 --> 00:46:07,977
by Atlantic recording artist,
Ray Charles.

858
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,564
And we have the gentleman
live here in the KCOH studios.

859
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:14,692
So, Ray, when you're not making your 
own music, what do you listen to?

860
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:18,445
You know what, the fact is, King Bee, 
I really and truly love gospel.

861
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:21,407
One of my favorite groups
is from right here in Houston:

862
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,325
The Cecil Shaw Singers.

863
00:46:23,534 --> 00:46:27,079
You heard it: Ray Charles endorses
Houston's own Cecil Shaw.

864
00:46:27,163 --> 00:46:29,081
We'll be playing
gospel all day Sunday ...

865
00:46:29,165 --> 00:46:30,833
but right now,
let's hear some more ...

866
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:32,543
of that Mess Around
by Ray Charles.

867
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:33,961
K.B., line 1.

868
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:37,673
King Bee.

869
00:46:39,383 --> 00:46:40,384
Mmm-hmm.

870
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:43,053
Yeah, he's right here.

871
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:46,265
Miss Della Antwine
of the Cecil Shaw Singers.

872
00:46:49,727 --> 00:46:51,562
Hello, Miss Antwine.

873
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:54,732
You sung tenor in
Jesus Is My Shepherd, right?

874
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:56,025
Yes.

875
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:58,611
How did you pick me out?

876
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:01,655
Actually,
I ... I hear like you see.

877
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:05,451
Like that hummingbird outside 
the window, for instance.

878
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:12,917
I can't hear her.

879
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,251
You have to listen.

880
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:33,354
Yes.

881
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:34,438
Yeah.

882
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:35,856
Yes, you can.

883
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:36,982
OH-OH.

884
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:38,025
You hear that?

885
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:39,151
What?

886
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:42,029
Her heart just skipped a beat.

887
00:47:44,281 --> 00:47:46,158
Oh, did you like my record?

888
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,828
The one that King Bee was playin'?

889
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:51,872
It was very nice.

890
00:47:52,123 --> 00:47:54,333
Different than the others.

891
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:56,836
I've heard a lot of your music.

892
00:47:56,919 --> 00:47:58,462
Was it very nice, too?

893
00:47:58,546 --> 00:48:00,798
Look, Miss Antwine, if you
don't really like the record,

894
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:04,260
you ain't got to beat around the bush 
with me. I mean, my mama never did.

895
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:06,637
It's not that I don't
enjoy your music.

896
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,056
It's just that I feel
I've heard it before.

897
00:48:09,098 --> 00:48:11,642
I keep wondering what the 
real Ray Charles sound like.

898
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:13,185
Ray Charles? Who's he?

899
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:15,187
Nobody, if you don't know.

900
00:48:15,271 --> 00:48:16,230
Huh?

901
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:19,525
Sorry. I should have
kept my mouth shut.

902
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:21,777
Oh, no, no.
Then you wouldn't be you.

903
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:25,406
You know, it's not like 
I haven't heard that before.

904
00:48:25,448 --> 00:48:28,784
I guess I just, uh, never
really listened, that's all.

905
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:33,956
Ain't nobody ever put
it that sweet, I guess.

906
00:48:51,182 --> 00:48:53,100
You know what,
Miss Della Bea Antwine?

907
00:48:53,142 --> 00:48:55,269
You really are a country girl.
You know that?

908
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:57,313
Yes.
How'd you know?

909
00:48:57,396 --> 00:48:59,440
I could tell by
the way you ordered.

910
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:01,692
"Let me get molasses
with my cornbread."

911
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:04,612
Were you raised on a farm?

912
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:07,531
My mother did a little 
sharecropping in Florida.

913
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:09,074
Is she still there?

914
00:49:09,158 --> 00:49:11,994
God bless her heart, she passed 
away when I went to school.

915
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:13,579
Ray, I'm sorry.

916
00:49:14,038 --> 00:49:15,748
She never was real healthy.

917
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:18,375
She just worked herself 
to death, poor thing.

918
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:21,253
That's why she didn't want me 
carrying around no tin cup.

919
00:49:21,337 --> 00:49:23,047
The kids I went to school with,

920
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,800
they were doing basket-weavin'
and wickerwork.

921
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,969
But not you. Because of your gift.

922
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:30,721
Because of my ears.

923
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:32,932
See, I can mimic
damn near anybody,

924
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:35,684
and I ... I ... I ... I make
a pretty decent living at it.

925
00:49:35,768 --> 00:49:37,812
It's just, if I
change my style up ...

926
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:39,438
and people really don't dig it,

927
00:49:39,522 --> 00:49:41,774
I mean, what am I
left with, you know?

928
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:44,360
I mean, when you're blind,
Miss Antwine,

929
00:49:44,527 --> 00:49:46,612
you ain't got that many choices.

930
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:50,324
Seem to me like you got all
the choices in the world.

931
00:49:51,534 --> 00:49:53,327
God gave you the gift to sound ...

932
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:55,663
like anybody you please,
even yourself.

933
00:49:57,414 --> 00:49:59,625
We're here. This is where I live.

934
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:02,586
Well, you think
the preacher'd let me in?

935
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:05,005
I mean, uh, I'm a sinner,
but I need a little prayer.

936
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:07,550
His wife don't like
me having male company.

937
00:50:07,675 --> 00:50:10,803
Well, tell him there's
a soul out here that needs savin'.

938
00:50:11,554 --> 00:50:14,974
You know what, Miss Antwine,
you really got me thinkin'.

939
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:18,269
About what?

940
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:21,689
About my life. About my music.

941
00:50:23,816 --> 00:50:25,317
About everything.

942
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:31,031
Ray, don't ... don't you think
we're movin' a little fast?

943
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:34,743
Listen, I'm ... I'm gonna
go to New York ...

944
00:50:34,827 --> 00:50:37,329
for a couple of weeks,
and when I get back,

945
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:40,207
you can take it as
slow as you want.

946
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:44,712
All right, Mr. Charles.

947
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:47,840
All right, Miss Antwine.

948
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:49,884
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.

949
00:50:49,925 --> 00:50:51,969
Well, hold on, now.
Let me call you a cab.

950
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:53,721
I got it. Three blocks up,

951
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:56,515
left for two, right for one.

952
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:58,309
Fifteen giant steps,

953
00:50:58,392 --> 00:51:00,311
and I'm at the
Crystal White Hotel. Hello.

954
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:10,154
"Mess Around" was
a positive step for us, Ray.

955
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:11,363
We're making progress.

956
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:13,574
Oh, come on, Ahmet.
Now, you've been nice to me.

957
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:15,409
But I haven't given
you guys any hits.

958
00:51:15,493 --> 00:51:17,036
Atlantic Records
has been good to me,

959
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,829
but if you want me to do
something special,

960
00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:20,247
I'm gonna need my own band.

961
00:51:20,748 --> 00:51:23,959
Oh, man. Taking a band out on 
the road costs a mint, Ray.

962
00:51:24,043 --> 00:51:27,087
I mean, even Joe Morris is struggling. 
His band's had a hit record.

963
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:29,006
But, Ahmet, listen,
I'm not Joe Morris.

964
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:31,342
Man, you told me if I think
pennies, I get pennies.

965
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:33,302
I'm thinking dollars, man.

966
00:51:34,637 --> 00:51:37,473
Ruth Brown's got
a tour booked in Georgia.

967
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:39,809
She needs a band.

968
00:51:39,892 --> 00:51:40,893
I ... I'll take it.

969
00:51:40,976 --> 00:51:43,729
I could write the charts
for her, I ... I could do backup,

970
00:51:43,813 --> 00:51:45,856
and also be an openin' act.

971
00:51:48,818 --> 00:51:50,152
Okay.

972
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:52,530
But you're going to be
financially responsible.

973
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:54,532
You're gonna have
to make it work, Ray.

974
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:57,118
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna make it
do what it do, baby.

975
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,577
Yeah.

976
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:11,715
Ray!

977
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:14,385
Miss Antwine, it's been two weeks.

978
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:16,178
It's been three.

979
00:52:21,851 --> 00:52:24,311
Now, where's the preacher at?
And the wife?

980
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:26,522
They in Dallas till Monday.

981
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:28,357
Well, hallelujah!

982
00:52:38,576 --> 00:52:39,994
Della Bea.

983
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,663
Kind of like a honey bee, right?

984
00:52:46,584 --> 00:52:48,252
Can I call you Bea?

985
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:51,547
Yeah, I'd like that.

986
00:52:54,425 --> 00:52:58,262
There's only been two cats that 
I ever really trusted in my life.

987
00:52:59,889 --> 00:53:03,017
There's Jeff Brown, he's going 
to be my tour manager,

988
00:53:03,893 --> 00:53:06,187
Fathead Newman, my tenor man ...

989
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:09,857
and now you.

990
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:18,949
But you gotta do me a favor.

991
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:21,118
Bea, you gotta
always tell me the truth.

992
00:53:21,202 --> 00:53:23,329
Oh, yeah. 
Just like you did before.

993
00:53:24,205 --> 00:53:27,166
Don't feel sorry for me
just 'cause I'm blind.

994
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,795
How could I pity
someone I admire?

995
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,301
Can I play something for you?

996
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:38,969
- Now?
- Yeah.

997
00:53:39,053 --> 00:53:40,179
No, Ray.

998
00:53:40,262 --> 00:53:42,181
Yeah, right now.
Right now. I'm gonna ...

999
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:43,390
Ray!

1000
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:49,146
It's right there.
You got it.

1001
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:50,439
Okay.

1002
00:53:50,523 --> 00:53:51,732
Yeah, yeah, this will work.

1003
00:53:52,942 --> 00:53:55,236
Now you go ahead and play. 
I'm gonna close these drapes.

1004
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,320
All right.

1005
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:57,905

I know what it is.
I wrote it.

to find my own voice.

But what the hell
are we gonna tell Ray?

1044
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:34,627
We just have
to tell him the truth:

1045
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,504
Ruth Brown's pregnant,
so there's no tour.

1046
00:55:36,545 --> 00:55:38,339
What about LaVern Baker?

1047
00:55:38,464 --> 00:55:40,466
Get LaVern Baker to take the tour.

1048
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:42,718
She doesn't have a record.
There's nothing to promote.

1049
00:55:42,802 --> 00:55:44,970
You and Jesse get up there,
write a couple of songs,

1050

let's get her in the studio.

1051
00:55:46,514 --> 00:55:48,182
It's gonna take
a month to do that ...

We got to do somethin'.

1053

Ray's got a whole
new band up there.

1054

together a band so fast?

Boss! Boss, they're here.

1056

that's my opinion.

1089
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:12,183
Milt Shaw, meet Ray Charles.

1090
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:14,101
Ray, It was
Milt's dad, Billy,

1091
00:57:14,143 --> 00:57:16,770
who first drew my attention
to a certain blind pianist ...

1092
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:18,814
when he was
booking Lowell Fulson.

1093
00:57:18,898 --> 00:57:21,317
Ray Charles.
We believe in your talent.

1094
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,986
We wanna be
in the Ray Charles business.

1095
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:26,489
We've already got you
booked on a 10-city tour ...

1096
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:28,073
with Roy Milton's Solid Senders ...

1097
00:57:28,115 --> 00:57:29,325
Oh, Roy Milton, I love him.

1098
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:32,286
 ... and Tangula,
the Exotic Shake Dancer.

1099
00:57:32,495 --> 00:57:35,039
She is gorgeous.

1100
00:57:35,164 --> 00:57:36,457
Ray, I gotta tell you,

1101
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:39,043
we think you're onto
something very big here.

1102
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:42,213
Nobody's ever combined
R&B and gospel before.

1103
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:43,672
"I've Got A Woman" is a smash.

1104
00:57:43,756 --> 00:57:46,592
You better start thinking about a 
follow-up, my friend. Right now.

1105
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:48,803
You know, this sounds good.
I gotta run to Texas ...

1106
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:51,472
and take care of some business,
and, I'll be right back.

1107
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:54,141
Well, make it fast. 
I'm ready to sell, sell, sell.

1108

me in front of Tangula.

of freedom, man.

Don't open that door.

1117
00:58:13,285 --> 00:58:16,122
Ray, you gotta carry her
over the threshold.

1118
00:58:23,671 --> 00:58:26,006
To the right, Ray!
To the right, now!

1119

Why are you locking doors

1131
00:59:05,588 --> 00:59:06,797
You know the place is small.

1132
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:08,257
We gotta have a little privacy.

1133
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,759
Uh, what we need is
a little more room.

1134
00:59:10,843 --> 00:59:14,096
You know, we're gonna need some 
space while we start a family.

1139

01:02:32,586 --> 01:02:34,046
not with your baby inside me.

1209
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:35,172
Mmm-hmm.

1210
01:02:35,256 --> 01:02:37,216
I'm gonna get your shaving kit.

1211
01:02:38,217 --> 01:02:40,052
Uh, Bea,
I ... I got it.

1212
01:02:40,678 --> 01:02:42,304
Bea, hold ... hold on.

1213
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,269
Bea, let me get it.

1214
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:51,897
How long you been
hiding this from me?

1215
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:54,316
Ray!

1216
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:57,111
I'm your wife!

1217
01:02:57,194 --> 01:02:59,071
Bea, I ... I was just so
excited to see you.

1218
01:02:59,155 --> 01:03:01,449
I forgot to leave it back there 
with the band, that's all.

1219
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:02,825
Let me ... Let me get it.

1220
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:05,119
Oh, it's just a little medicine,
that's all, baby.

1221
01:03:05,202 --> 01:03:06,620
That ain't medicine to nobody, Ray.

1222
01:03:06,704 --> 01:03:08,080
Don't be lyin' to yourself.

1223
01:03:08,164 --> 01:03:09,748
It ain't like I'm
dealing it, baby.

1224
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,292
I just use it
to get a little taste.

1225
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,127
You don't taste poison, Ray. 
It kills you.

1226
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:14,253
Now, you got to stop.

1227
01:03:14,336 --> 01:03:16,464
I ain't got to do
a goddamn thing!

1228
01:03:18,048 --> 01:03:20,676
What about me?
What about your baby?

1229
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,344
Bea.

1230
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:24,805
It ain't like I'm new to this.

1231
01:03:25,347 --> 01:03:28,017
If I felt like this was 
jeopardizing my music, or you,

1232
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,477
or providing for that baby,

1233
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,687
I would stop in a minute.
But I know it won't.

1234
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:34,273
How do you know that, Ray? 
How do ... How do you know that?

1235
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:36,817
You know what? You can talk till
you're blue in the face,

1236
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:38,569
it don't matter.
I'm not gonna stop.

1237
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:39,612
Then I'm comin' with you.

1238
01:03:39,695 --> 01:03:40,613
No, no.

1239
01:03:40,654 --> 01:03:41,739
Well, Ray, you just said ...

1240
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:43,449
No. No.
You know what it is, Bea.

1241
01:03:43,491 --> 01:03:45,409
I ... I think
it's like you said.

1242
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:49,163
I don't think that the road 
is a place for you and the baby.

1243
01:03:51,749 --> 01:03:53,584
What are you saying to me, Ray?

1244
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:55,836
What I'm sayin' is
that when I get home,

1245
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,255
I hope that you're
here at my house.

1246
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:01,342
Your house?

1247
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:07,723
Jeff, come get this bag.

1248
01:04:07,807 --> 01:04:09,308
All right, Ray.

1249
01:04:11,435 --> 01:04:12,937
Hey, Della Bea.

1250
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,277

Uh, Mary Ann, how would you feel ...

1265
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:18,252
if I asked you to sing a torch 
song with a gospel feel to it?

1266

Well, Gospel's all about
love anyway, isn't it?

Oh, yeah.

1268

Would it make you
feel like a sinner?

1269
01:05:27,303 --> 01:05:29,889
Well, Mr. Charles, 
I love the Lord, the Lord loves me.

1270
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:31,432
But I ain't no hypocrite.

1271

It's hard to fool me,

but it's impossible to fool 
the Almighty, ain't it?

1273
01:05:39,482 --> 01:05:41,776
Why don't we rehearse
the song a little bit?

1274
01:05:41,859 --> 01:05:42,902
Okay.

1275
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:45,488

So, what do you think?

1291
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:16,287
Ray, telephone.

1292
01:07:16,662 --> 01:07:18,038
Take a message.

1293
01:07:19,832 --> 01:07:21,375
It's Della Bea.

1294
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:23,335
Damn it.

1295
01:07:23,461 --> 01:07:25,671
Uh, tell her I'm busy.

1296
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:28,591
Come on, man,
I ain't lying to Bea.

1297
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:30,718
Uh-oh.

1298
01:07:30,885 --> 01:07:32,052
Is that the wife?

1299
01:07:32,136 --> 01:07:33,512
Shut up.

1300
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,184
I-I'll be there in a second.

1301
01:07:40,936 --> 01:07:42,855
Don't mess with
this junk, all right?

1302
01:07:42,897 --> 01:07:44,899
All it'll do is make you sick.

1303
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:51,572
Does he have all
his fingers and toes?

1304
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:53,574
Yes, he does.

1305
01:07:57,953 --> 01:07:59,330
Can he, uh ...

1306
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,585
Can he see?

1307
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:07,338
Yes.

1308
01:08:10,382 --> 01:08:11,884
You want to hold him?

1309
01:08:11,926 --> 01:08:13,260
No, I can't.

1310
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:14,303
Come on, Ray.

1311
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:15,888
I wouldn't know
what to do it right.

1312
01:08:15,971 --> 01:08:17,598
That's what you came here for.

1313
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:19,934
Use this hand to hold his head.

1314
01:08:20,851 --> 01:08:22,853
Okay. Right there.

1315
01:08:32,988 --> 01:08:34,657
That's your daddy.

1316
01:08:34,949 --> 01:08:35,950
Yeah.

1317
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:40,663
He ain't no bigger
than a loaf of bread.

1318
01:08:41,372 --> 01:08:42,665
Thank you.

1319
01:08:43,457 --> 01:08:45,626
He's not my gift to you, Ray.

1320
01:08:45,918 --> 01:08:47,336
He's your son.

1321
01:08:48,546 --> 01:08:51,257
You know I'm gonna take care of 
both of you. You know that, right?

1322
01:08:53,801 --> 01:08:55,302
I love you.

1323
01:08:56,762 --> 01:08:58,472
I love you, too, Ray.

1324
01:08:58,639 --> 01:09:00,683
But there's
something I got to say.

1325
01:09:00,808 --> 01:09:03,936
I know you're a musician,
a working musician,

1326
01:09:03,978 --> 01:09:06,605
but don't bring the road
into our home again.

1327
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:09,442
The home I'm making
for you and our children.

1328
01:09:09,483 --> 01:09:11,735
Bea, I ... I promise
I won't do that.

1329
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:13,487
It ... It's just there's
some things ...

1330
01:09:13,571 --> 01:09:15,614
No. Now, don't say no more.

1331
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:17,658
I ain't no fool.

1332
01:09:18,284 --> 01:09:20,661
You know, you're
the only woman I'll ever love.

1333
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:36,469
Mama! Mama, help!

1334
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:41,390
Mama, help!
Mama, help, please!

1335
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:43,684
I need you!

1336
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:51,150
Mama, help!

1337
01:09:52,777 --> 01:09:54,069
Mama!

1338
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:49,977
I hear you, too, Mama.
You're right there.

1339
01:11:57,485 --> 01:11:59,487
Yeah, yes, I am.

1340
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:04,492
Why are you crying, Mama?

1341
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:05,993
'Cause I'm happy.

1342
01:12:10,164 --> 01:12:11,999
Hey, it's Uncle Jeff!

1343
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:14,168

right there behind them.

01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:16,457
You take a week off and stay here,
find some material,

1382
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,626
and when I get back,
we can talk about it.

1383
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:20,920
Okay. Okay.

1384
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,215
Okay.

1385
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:42,650
Ah, you know what,
I dig New York, man.

1386
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:44,860
It's like everybody here's
making their own sound.

1387
01:14:44,944 --> 01:14:46,695
They loved it. 
Ray, they loved you.

1388
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:48,489
We're gonna
get the cover of Billboard.

1389
01:14:48,531 --> 01:14:51,617
You know what, I want to do a session 
while I'm here. How about tomorrow?

1390
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,827
What, you got the band here?

1391
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:54,829
Yeah. I've got the band here
Step down.

1392
01:14:54,912 --> 01:14:57,623
Everybody except Mary Ann, because 
I need a different background.

1393
01:14:57,665 --> 01:15:00,376
You know what I'm sayin', I've been 
hearing this thing in my head,

1394
01:15:00,459 --> 01:15:02,545
kind of like a dance
between a man and three women.

1395
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:04,463
Sounds fun. Can I watch?

1396
01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:06,132
It's a dance of voices, Ahmet.

1397
01:15:06,215 --> 01:15:08,509
W — What do you have in mind?
Like three Mary Anns?

1398
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:11,011
Oh, no, no, no.
That's too smooth.

1399
01:15:11,095 --> 01:15:13,681
I need somethin' that ... 
that's more raw.

When it's happening, baby,
I mean, it just feels right.

1446
01:16:52,488 --> 01:16:55,366
I know what you mean. I got the 
shivers in this studio tonight.

1447
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:57,743
That's 'cause they ain't
paid the heating bill.

1448
01:16:57,785 --> 01:16:59,912
I have a question for
all of you:

1449
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:02,498
How would you like to
go on the road with me?

1450
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:07,253
Wait ... wait. How, um,
how much you gonna pay us?

1451
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:09,088
You know, Ahmet takes care
of all of that.

1452
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:11,006
Oh, what, you mean
he don't listen to you?

1453
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:12,591
Yeah, you better know he does.

1454
01:17:12,883 --> 01:17:15,803
Look, don't worry about it. Brother 
Ray'll take care of all of you.

1455
01:17:15,845 --> 01:17:18,973
Well, my mama taught me to
take care of myself, honey.

1456
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,850
Is your mother here?

1457
01:17:20,933 --> 01:17:22,643
No, she's not,
but I speak for us.

1458
01:17:22,685 --> 01:17:23,769
No, you don't.

1459
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:27,940
Okay, Speak for Us, how about, 
uh, ahem, $20 a week?

1460
01:17:27,982 --> 01:17:30,484

No, no, no.
Uh, how about $25?

1464
01:17:35,614 --> 01:17:37,074
We'll take $30.

are going to be called:
"The Raelettes".

1472
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:52,548
Raelettes?

1473
01:17:52,631 --> 01:17:54,592
Does that mean
we have to "Let Ray"?

1474
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:56,469
Oh, Lord! What am I going
to do with you?

1475
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:58,179
I'm sure you'll think
of somethin'.

1476
01:18:00,431 --> 01:18:01,682

From now on, we're gonna sing,

01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:39,053
Ethel, I want you to sing,
uh, uh, alto.

01:18:39,553 --> 01:18:43,015
Margie, you sing tenor.
Pat, soprano, and Mary Ann, bass.

1484
01:18:43,849 --> 01:18:45,559
I ain't no bass. I'm a soprano.

1485
01:18:46,018 --> 01:18:47,394
I'll sing bass.

1486
01:18:47,478 --> 01:18:49,563
I mean, where we come from,
we can sing anything.

01:22:21,164 --> 01:22:22,749
I thought you was
my friend, Fathead.

1551
01:22:22,832 --> 01:22:24,125
The weight is off.

1552
01:22:24,709 --> 01:22:26,086
Don't start with me, Ray.

1553
01:22:26,169 --> 01:22:27,212
The weight is off.

1554
01:22:27,295 --> 01:22:28,338
It ain't off.

1555
01:22:28,421 --> 01:22:30,548
When you get high, man,
and you try to cop,

1556
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:32,175
those dealers spank your ass.

1557
01:22:32,258 --> 01:22:33,760
You gotta have more discipline.

1558
01:22:33,843 --> 01:22:37,847
You know what, man? I ain't 
messing up my high tonight,

1559
01:22:38,098 --> 01:22:40,767
sitting here with you,
arguing about nothin'.

1560
01:22:42,685 --> 01:22:45,730
Look, Fathead, just tie me off.

1561
01:22:46,689 --> 01:22:48,066
Come on, Fathead. Fat.

1562
01:22:49,359 --> 01:22:52,695
Take care of your bad self,
you know so damn much.

1563
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:55,198
Later, Margie.

1564
01:22:55,615 --> 01:22:57,367
Bye, Fathead.

1565
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,413
Damn.

1566
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:09,087
Ain't nothing free
in this world but Jesus.

1567
01:23:15,385 --> 01:23:16,386
Hey, Margie.

1568
01:23:16,469 --> 01:23:18,638
Yeah? What do you want?

1569
01:23:19,055 --> 01:23:21,725
Do me a favor, sweetheart,
and ... and pick that up for me.

1570
01:23:22,308 --> 01:23:24,519
You're going to have to get me off.

1571
01:23:27,021 --> 01:23:28,857
I'll do it,
if you let me try some.

1572
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,024
Shit. No, honey.

1573
01:23:30,108 --> 01:23:31,776
This ain't for no little girls.

1574
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:33,820
I ain't no little girl!

1575
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,114
I understand.
It's just that this stuff ...

1576
01:23:36,197 --> 01:23:39,242
will take you places
that you don't want to go.

1577
01:23:39,617 --> 01:23:41,161
See, I want to share
that with you.

1578
01:23:41,244 --> 01:23:42,620
Listen to me!

1579
01:23:42,746 --> 01:23:44,622
If I ever hear about you
doing some drugs ...

1580
01:23:44,664 --> 01:23:46,541
you're through, you hear me?

1581
01:23:46,624 --> 01:23:48,960
You believe that more than you
believe in Jesus!

1582
01:23:50,003 --> 01:23:51,963
Don't say that, Ray.

1583
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:55,467
Ray!

1584
01:23:55,508 --> 01:23:58,595
Ray, I watch your show
every single night.

1585
01:23:59,512 --> 01:24:01,681
And every night is new to me.

1586
01:24:01,848 --> 01:24:04,017
Maybe because it's new to you.

1587
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:07,979
It's like you live
every single word ...

1588
01:24:08,354 --> 01:24:11,316
and then you
bend some crazy note,

1589
01:24:12,859 --> 01:24:15,111
And damn if you
don't break my heart.

1590

But how the hell are
we gonna market this?

1725
01:29:47,068 --> 01:29:49,779
We could cut the second verse,
pop back into the chorus.

1726
01:29:49,863 --> 01:29:52,115
Man, you cut that,
I'll cut you in half.

1727
01:29:52,532 --> 01:29:54,659
All right, all right, Ray. Ahem.

1728
01:29:54,826 --> 01:29:57,412
We could, uh, split it up.

1729
01:29:57,495 --> 01:29:59,956
Do a Side A, Side B type of thing.

1730
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,958
It's been done before.
What the hell, right?

1731
01:30:02,042 --> 01:30:03,001
Yeah.

1732
01:30:04,544 --> 01:30:06,129
It's s-sexual.

1733
01:30:06,212 --> 01:30:08,131
It's just too damn sexual for kids.

1734
01:30:08,214 --> 01:30:09,466
Let's do it.

1735
01:30:09,549 --> 01:30:11,551
Yeah, baby!
That's why I love y'all, man.

1736
01:30:11,634 --> 01:30:13,970
All right. What the hell?
It's Atlantic, right?

1737
01:30:14,054 --> 01:30:15,013
Atlantic!

1738
01:30:15,055 --> 01:30:16,264
We'll release it in the summer.

1739
01:30:16,347 --> 01:30:17,974
There's less censorship,
school's out.

1740
01:30:18,058 --> 01:30:19,726
The kids are ready to kick loose.

1741
01:30:19,809 --> 01:30:21,561
Ha, okay!

1742
01:30:23,646 --> 01:30:26,983
Tom, let's see if we can cut
this pumpkin in two.

1743
01:30:27,067 --> 01:30:28,943
Show me what your
genius is all about.

1744
01:30:29,027 --> 01:30:30,278
You got it, boss.

1745
01:30:30,737 --> 01:30:34,115
Yeah, that is it. You put one 
on Side A, put another on Side B.

1746
01:30:34,199 --> 01:30:35,533
Man, that sounds out of sight.

1747
01:30:35,575 --> 01:30:36,659
How you feeling, Ray?

1748
01:30:36,743 --> 01:30:38,244
I feel groovy, baby.

1749
01:30:38,745 --> 01:30:41,039
- I'm talking about the junk.
- What?

1750
01:30:41,331 --> 01:30:43,083
It's starting to show.

1751
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:45,377
You're scratching all the time.

1752
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:46,711
You can't sit still.

1753
01:30:47,545 --> 01:30:49,798
Hey, man, have I ever
missed a date?

1754
01:30:49,881 --> 01:30:51,591
No, you never have.

1755
01:30:51,674 --> 01:30:53,968
Who's the one who delivers 
a record in one take, hmm?

1756
01:30:54,052 --> 01:30:56,262
Ray, you deliver better
than anybody I know ...

1757
01:30:56,346 --> 01:30:58,765
but I'm not talking to you
as a businessman.

1758
01:30:58,848 --> 01:31:00,850
Now come on, listen to me.

1759
01:31:01,726 --> 01:31:03,561
I'm worried about you.

1760
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:07,482
As a friend, I'm telling you, 
man, your slip is hanging.

1761
01:31:08,608 --> 01:31:10,026
"Your slip is hanging."

1762
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:13,530
You been hanging out with us 
country boys too much, man.

1763
01:31:13,613 --> 01:31:17,075
Uh, don't worry about this, man. 
If this monkey gets too heavy on my back,

1764
01:31:17,117 --> 01:31:19,869

- A guitar.

1831
01:34:08,705 --> 01:34:10,206
I want to stay and open my presents.

01:36:42,567 --> 01:36:43,610
You sent the girls home.

1893
01:36:43,693 --> 01:36:46,071
I know what I did with the girls.
Let me take care of that.

1894
01:36:46,112 --> 01:36:49,074
You just turn that eight-track on, 
and I'll do the girls' parts myself.

1895
01:36:49,157 --> 01:36:52,077
And go out here somewhere and 
find me an "Oh, Johnny" girl.

1896
01:36:52,452 --> 01:36:54,079
Uh, one minute.

1897
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:56,664
What the hell's an "Oh, Johnny" girl?

1898
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:58,375
I think I've got an idea.

1899
01:36:58,917 --> 01:37:02,670
♪ Last night you were dreaming ♪

1900
01:37:02,754 --> 01:37:05,548
♪ and I heard you say ♪

1901
01:37:07,467 --> 01:37:09,260

♪ Yes I believe ♪

1909
01:37:27,487 --> 01:37:29,489
The sky's the limit, Ray.

1910
01:37:29,656 --> 01:37:31,658
I got you a $5,000-a-night raise.

1911
01:37:31,908 --> 01:37:33,785
They're gonna up you to 15 per.

1912
01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:35,328
Rehearsal in 10 minutes, guys.

1913
01:37:35,412 --> 01:37:37,163
Jeff, could you get
me some cigarettes?

1914
01:37:37,831 --> 01:37:39,124
Okay, boss.

1915
01:37:41,584 --> 01:37:43,002
15 per, huh?

1916
01:37:43,086 --> 01:37:47,257
You know, Ray, your contract with 
ATLANTIC is expiring in four months.

1917
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:48,591
Yeah.

1918
01:37:48,675 --> 01:37:50,635
Yeah, I've got the contract with me.

1919
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,679
They're going to double my royalties.

1920
01:37:52,762 --> 01:37:54,681
Before we jump back in that pond,

1921
01:37:54,848 --> 01:37:57,016
I thought I'd find out
what else was out there.

1922
01:37:57,100 --> 01:38:00,729
I had a very productive chat
with ABC-Paramount yesterday.

1923
01:38:00,854 --> 01:38:02,772
ABC? Who told you to do that, huh?

1924
01:38:02,856 --> 01:38:05,817
And you know, Atlantic is family,
just like the Shaw Agency.

1925
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:08,319
Ray, my job is to get you
the best deal possible.

1926
01:38:09,029 --> 01:38:10,989
ABC is very interested.

1927
01:38:11,031 --> 01:38:12,073
No.

1928
01:38:14,701 --> 01:38:16,036
How interested?

1929
01:38:16,911 --> 01:38:21,833
How about a $50,000 advance
each year for three years?

1930
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:23,960
You produce your own records.

1931
01:38:24,377 --> 01:38:26,880
They'll deduct recording costs
and give you ...

1932
01:38:27,255 --> 01:38:28,923
75 percent.

1933
01:38:32,594 --> 01:38:34,387
Ahmet and Jerry are
flying in tonight,

1934
01:38:34,429 --> 01:38:39,348
so will you put them off until 
I can talk things out with ABC?

1935
01:38:41,394 --> 01:38:43,897
Well, my mama said, ain't 
nothing wrong with talking.

1936
01:38:45,023 --> 01:38:46,024
Hey, enough of the formalities.

1937
01:38:46,107 --> 01:38:48,026
Come on, let's go back
into the office, Ray.

1938
01:38:48,109 --> 01:38:49,152
I hope I can call you Ray.

1939
01:38:49,235 --> 01:38:50,695
I want you to be comfortable here.

1940
01:38:50,779 --> 01:38:53,823
Because I'll tell you something, 
everything is gonna be better at ABC.

1941
01:38:53,907 --> 01:38:55,825
Moving from an indie label
to a major ...

1942
01:38:55,909 --> 01:38:57,535
means you can sell
a lot more records,

1943
01:38:57,577 --> 01:39:00,872
as well as attract much larger 
crowds, both white and Negro.

1944
01:39:00,955 --> 01:39:04,542
Yeah, but Mr. Clark, you know, 
I've been at Atlantic for so long,

1945
01:39:05,085 --> 01:39:09,381
I just want to give those guys a chance, 
you know, to at least match the offer.

1946
01:39:09,422 --> 01:39:11,716
Mm-hmm. Oh, certainly, certainly.

1947
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,301
But, uh, I doubt they'll be able to.

1948
01:39:13,385 --> 01:39:15,345
We're giving you
a state-of-the-art deal here.

1949
01:39:15,428 --> 01:39:18,807
Well, you know, since I'm producing my own 
records, I was wondering if I could ...

1950
01:39:18,890 --> 01:39:20,725
uh, own my masters, too.

1951
01:39:28,274 --> 01:39:29,275
Well,

1952
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:31,569
Ray, we've ... we've never
done that before.

1953
01:39:31,653 --> 01:39:33,697
No record company has.

1954
01:39:33,822 --> 01:39:38,535
Well, I think I'm going to have to have it 
that way for me to leave Atlantic Records.

1955
01:39:47,377 --> 01:39:49,713
Ahmet believes
we're family here at Atlantic.

1956
01:39:49,796 --> 01:39:51,840
I believe we're family
here at Atlantic.

1957
01:39:51,923 --> 01:39:53,758
Obviously, you don't!

1958
01:39:54,217 --> 01:39:55,760
Ahmet wouldn't believe it.

1959
01:39:55,844 --> 01:39:57,387
You know what he said, Ray?

1960
01:39:57,470 --> 01:39:59,431
He said you would never
turn your back on us.

1961
01:39:59,514 --> 01:40:01,641
Never for a Schlockmeister
like Sam Clark!

1962
01:40:02,809 --> 01:40:04,894
That's rich.
Sam Clark's a corporate slug,

1963
01:40:04,978 --> 01:40:08,148
who wouldn't know the difference 
between Earl Hines and Art Tatum!

1964
01:40:14,487 --> 01:40:16,531
We let you grow here, Ray.

1965
01:40:16,823 --> 01:40:20,493
And nobody's taking credit for 
your talent, but we nourished it.

1966
01:40:20,994 --> 01:40:22,954
We let you do your thing.

1967
01:40:24,539 --> 01:40:26,750
God damn it!
We deserve better than this.

1968
01:40:26,833 --> 01:40:28,877
You know what, don't think that
I don't appreciate ...

1969
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,754
everything you guys
have done here, Jerry.

1970
01:40:30,837 --> 01:40:33,465
Ahmet, I'm very proud of the work 
that we've done here together.

1971
01:40:33,506 --> 01:40:36,760
But, Atlantic has done pretty good 
money-wise on my records, haven't they?

1972
01:40:36,843 --> 01:40:38,261
Yes, we've done very well, Ray.

1973
01:40:38,344 --> 01:40:41,556
You ... you were the ones that taught 
me that making a record is business,

1974
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:43,975
and find the best
business deal you can.

1975
01:40:44,059 --> 01:40:47,312
Now, 75 cents of every dollar,
and owning my own masters ...

1976
01:40:47,395 --> 01:40:49,522
is a pretty damn good deal.

1977
01:40:50,065 --> 01:40:51,691
Can you match it?

1978
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:56,780
Ray, we would love to
match it, but we just can't.

1979
01:40:58,114 --> 01:41:00,950
That's a better deal
than Sinatra gets.

1980
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:05,330
I'm very proud of you.

1981
01:41:07,832 --> 01:41:11,419
Looks like those boys are going 
to get a taste of country dumb.

1982
01:41:11,503 --> 01:41:12,670
Yeah.

1983
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:16,925
He'll be all right, man.

1984
01:41:18,093 --> 01:41:20,011

Thought you said that ABC wasn't 
going to force nothing on him.

1996
01:42:20,071 --> 01:42:21,531
They didn't.

1997
01:42:22,198 --> 01:42:23,908
It was Ray's idea.

1998
01:42:25,994 --> 01:42:27,037
Something new.

1999
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:29,706
What are we then, Jeff?
Something old?

What the hell is wrong with that?

2007
01:43:13,249 --> 01:43:15,794
Critics say you've gone
middle-of-the-road.

2008
01:43:15,877 --> 01:43:18,963
The orchestra, the choir,
The Perry Como Show, man?

2009
01:43:19,047 --> 01:43:22,592
If I feel the music,
that means it's real.

2010
01:43:22,675 --> 01:43:25,303
No, it ain't.
Ray Charles is a sellout.

2011
01:43:25,387 --> 01:43:28,390
The blind Liberace, leaving those 
Rocking Chair roots behind.

2012
01:43:28,473 --> 01:43:29,432
Quincy Jones.

2013
01:43:29,516 --> 01:43:31,393
Can we get a picture
of these two guys?

2014
01:43:31,476 --> 01:43:33,311
- Six-nine!
- Hey, boy.

2015
01:43:33,395 --> 01:43:35,814
Look, here, uh,
this interview is over.

2016
01:43:35,897 --> 01:43:37,774
I'd love to
get you two together, man.

2017
01:43:37,816 --> 01:43:39,234
S-some other time.

2018
01:43:39,567 --> 01:43:42,195
Look at you. How's it going, man?
You look good.

2019
01:43:42,278 --> 01:43:44,322
Let me look at you.
You look good, too.

2020
01:43:44,406 --> 01:43:46,074
You hear what they're
saying about me?

2021
01:43:46,157 --> 01:43:49,244
I just said that I ... I can't do it 
no more. I've gone middle-of-the-road.

2022
01:43:49,327 --> 01:43:50,745
So crank out another hit.

2023
01:43:50,829 --> 01:43:51,955
Let me tell you something,

2024
01:43:51,996 --> 01:43:54,457
it ain't easy
to keep on being greezy, kid.

2025
01:43:54,916 --> 01:43:56,334
Where you blow in from?

2026
01:43:57,544 --> 01:43:58,628
Paris.

2027
01:43:58,712 --> 01:43:59,838
Bonjour.

2028
01:43:59,879 --> 01:44:02,090
Yeah, man.
France is where it's at.

2029
01:44:02,257 --> 01:44:04,342
Yeah, man. And all that stuff
you've been playing,

2030
01:44:04,426 --> 01:44:06,845
man, it's just ...
it really feels out of sight.

2031
01:44:06,886 --> 01:44:09,389
You know, we gotta
record something together.

2032
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,224
I mean, people will really dig it.

2033
01:44:11,307 --> 01:44:13,184
So, where you going
after the Festival?

2034
01:44:13,226 --> 01:44:17,021
Oh, I ... I go to D.C., Richmond,
uh, Virginia, Georgia.

2035
01:44:17,105 --> 01:44:19,983
You know what, once you get the 
record out there, you gotta sell it.

2036
01:44:20,025 --> 01:44:21,484
The South, man?

2037
01:44:22,694 --> 01:44:23,987
I'm not doing that no more.

2038
01:44:24,029 --> 01:44:26,865
Hey, come on, kid, that's where
the money is, baby.

2039
01:44:26,948 --> 01:44:29,492
You know, When I left Seattle
with Hamp,

2040
01:44:29,576 --> 01:44:30,785
we went down there, man.

2041
01:44:30,869 --> 01:44:33,455
And it felt like
I walked into a prison cell.

2042
01:44:33,538 --> 01:44:37,167
You know, a black man
is a "boy" in Mississippi, Ray.

2043
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:39,169
Even if he's 80 years old.

2044
01:44:42,422 --> 01:44:44,841
I'm never playing
to Jim Crow again. Ever.

2045
01:44:44,883 --> 01:44:46,718
If that's what you feel, baby.

2046
01:44:46,801 --> 01:44:50,472
I'm serious, Ray.
Man, we gotta do something.

2047
01:44:52,182 --> 01:44:54,059
Well, you know,
what ... what the hell, man.

2048
01:44:54,142 --> 01:44:57,520
You're just going to leave a lot 
more money on the table for me.

2049
01:44:58,063 --> 01:44:59,731
You're welcome to it, man.

2050
01:45:14,829 --> 01:45:16,373
You ready to work?

2051
01:45:16,456 --> 01:45:17,749
Work on what?

2052
01:45:18,958 --> 01:45:20,835
Get over here, you gotta
help me with this.

2053
01:45:20,919 --> 01:45:22,337
Percy just sent me some new music.

2054
01:45:36,393 --> 01:45:38,645
You know what
they're saying about me?

2055
01:45:38,728 --> 01:45:41,147
Said I've lost something, said 
I've gone middle-of-the-road.

2056
01:45:41,231 --> 01:45:43,483
They may as well say
the same thing about you.

2057
01:45:43,566 --> 01:45:44,901
You were the soul of this band.

2058
01:45:44,943 --> 01:45:47,404
Now every time you're around,
you're just drunk.

2059
01:45:49,406 --> 01:45:50,907
Drunk soul of a blind junkie.

2060
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:52,742
What a lovely couple.

2061
01:45:52,826 --> 01:45:55,203
Why don't you
just get out of here?

2062
01:45:57,038 --> 01:45:59,040
I ain't drunk, Ray.

2063
01:45:59,958 --> 01:46:01,292
I'm pregnant.

2064
01:46:02,502 --> 01:46:05,255
Yeah, that's right.
I'm having your baby.

2065
01:46:05,296 --> 01:46:08,133
You ain't really ...
You ... you can't do that.

2066
01:46:08,591 --> 01:46:10,260
I'm gonna have to
talk to the doctor.

2067
01:46:10,301 --> 01:46:11,469
You gotta get rid of it.

2068
01:46:12,887 --> 01:46:14,723
My God!

2069
01:46:14,848 --> 01:46:17,016
What, because
I'm not your precious Bea?

2070
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,811
I'm not good enough
to have this baby?

2071
01:46:20,979 --> 01:46:23,565
You lay up
in my bed every night.

2072
01:46:23,648 --> 01:46:24,858
My bed!

2073
01:46:25,984 --> 01:46:27,652
I'm gonna have this baby, Ray.

2074
01:46:30,864 --> 01:46:33,241
- No, Ray! No!
- Come on, come on. Come on, just listen.

2075
01:46:33,324 --> 01:46:34,284
Just listen to me.

2076
01:46:34,367 --> 01:46:35,702
You know
I care about you, baby.

2077
01:46:35,785 --> 01:46:38,121
I won't let nothing happen to you.
I'll pay for everything.

2078
01:46:38,163 --> 01:46:39,247
No!

2079
01:46:39,330 --> 01:46:41,499
It's gonna cost you
more than money.

2080
01:46:41,541 --> 01:46:44,544
I want you to leave her, Ray.
Come and be with our baby.

2081
01:46:44,627 --> 01:46:48,131
You out of your damn mind. You knew 
the rules when you got into this.

2082
01:46:48,173 --> 01:46:50,550
You know goddamn well I ain't 
gonna leave my family.

2083
01:46:51,968 --> 01:46:53,636
Leave your family?

2084
01:46:53,970 --> 01:46:56,473
You are a damn fool,
you know that?

2085
01:46:57,223 --> 01:47:00,560
Between the dope
and the music and me,

2086
01:47:00,643 --> 01:47:03,313
you already done left
your damn family!

2087
01:47:03,813 --> 01:47:07,692
You know what the sad part about 
it is, Ray, you don't even know it.

2088
01:47:12,614 --> 01:47:14,115
You know what?

2089
01:47:14,199 --> 01:47:17,702
From now on, it's strictly
business between you and me.

2090
01:47:20,747 --> 01:47:23,500
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

Hey, Ray, it's Sam.

Can you hear me? It's Sam!

2123
01:48:28,773 --> 01:48:31,401
Yeah, hey, Hit the Road
is our second number one.

2124
01:48:31,443 --> 01:48:34,612
Yeah. ABC is taking out ads
in all the trades.

2125
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:37,532
Yeah, oh, and congrats
on your Grammy nomination.

2126
01:48:37,991 --> 01:48:40,660
No, no, no I know
you're going to win.

2127
01:48:41,411 --> 01:48:43,079
Hey, you feeling all right?

2128
01:48:43,538 --> 01:48:46,124
Well, come on, baby, be happy.
You're doing good.

2129
01:48:46,374 --> 01:48:47,459
Thank you, Sam.

2130
01:48:48,668 --> 01:48:50,462
I really am happy about that.

2131
01:48:51,004 --> 01:48:52,547
Yeah.

2132
01:48:56,134 --> 01:48:59,512
I'll stop by Jeff's room
and get my money on my way out.

2133
01:49:06,519 --> 01:49:07,520
Ray.

2134
01:49:09,272 --> 01:49:11,149
Margie, you ain't gotta leave, baby.

2135
01:49:11,316 --> 01:49:13,276
I'm on your hit record.

2136
01:49:13,443 --> 01:49:16,279
If I'm ever going to go solo,
then now's the time.

2137
01:49:16,321 --> 01:49:18,156
Yeah, I ... I don't want you ...

2138
01:49:18,281 --> 01:49:20,075
I don't want you to go solo.

2139
01:49:20,158 --> 01:49:22,619
Ray, for once,
I'm doing something for me.

2140
01:49:23,661 --> 01:49:26,122
You remember the hummingbird,
right?

2141
01:49:26,915 --> 01:49:27,916
What?

2142
01:49:28,583 --> 01:49:30,335
The hummingbird, Bea.

2143
01:49:43,264 --> 01:49:45,433
And I don't want you to go.

2144
01:49:58,738 --> 01:50:00,198
Somebody will fetch you ...

2145
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:01,783
when your bus gets to St. Augustine.

2146
01:50:01,866 --> 01:50:03,993
And when you get there,
show them this sign,

2147
01:50:04,077 --> 01:50:06,413
and tell them you're name is
Ray Charles Robinson.

2148
01:50:07,372 --> 01:50:10,291
And them sandwiches I made, don't 
eat 'em all at once. You hear?

2149
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:12,585
Oh, please, don't make me go away.

2150
01:50:12,669 --> 01:50:14,295
I'll keep up with the normal kids.

2151
01:50:14,379 --> 01:50:16,339
I'll be good, just like George.

2152
01:50:16,423 --> 01:50:18,383
This ain't got nothing
to do with George.

2153
01:50:18,466 --> 01:50:20,927
I've taken you
as far as I can, baby.

2154
01:50:21,094 --> 01:50:24,347
Them teachers at that blind school, 
they can teach you things I can't.

2155
01:50:24,389 --> 01:50:26,141
And you need an education
in this world.

2156
01:50:26,224 --> 01:50:27,392
I don't want no education!

2157
01:50:27,475 --> 01:50:28,476
Don't say that!

2158
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,478
I don't! I want to stay with you!

2159
01:50:30,562 --> 01:50:31,563
Stop it, Ray!

2160
01:50:31,646 --> 01:50:34,315
I won't have you living
hand-to-mouth like me, you hear?

2161
01:50:35,191 --> 01:50:38,611
Now listen, if you want to do 
something to make your mama proud,

2162
01:50:38,903 --> 01:50:42,699
promise me, promise me you'll never 
let nobody turn you into no cripple.

2163
01:50:42,782 --> 01:50:44,492
You won't become no charity case.

2164
01:50:44,576 --> 01:50:46,494
You'll stand on your own two feet.

2165
01:50:46,578 --> 01:50:47,912
I promise.

2166
01:50:48,246 --> 01:50:49,706
I love you, baby.

2167
01:50:50,749 --> 01:50:52,208
I'm so proud of you.

2168
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:08,349
No more segregation!

2169
01:51:08,433 --> 01:51:11,436
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2170
01:51:11,519 --> 01:51:14,606
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2171
01:51:18,568 --> 01:51:21,363
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2172
01:51:21,446 --> 01:51:24,449
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2173
01:51:24,532 --> 01:51:27,577
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2174
01:51:27,619 --> 01:51:29,412
Welcome back to Augusta, Ray!

2175
01:51:29,454 --> 01:51:31,206
Hey, good to see you.

2176
01:51:31,498 --> 01:51:34,459
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2177
01:51:34,501 --> 01:51:36,294
Do you believe
in the protest, Ray?

2178
01:51:36,628 --> 01:51:38,004
Get out of here!

2179
01:51:38,088 --> 01:51:40,632
Ray, I'm sorry about this.
Hurry on up inside.

2180
01:51:40,715 --> 01:51:42,467
We got refreshments waiting.

2181
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:44,177
Mr. Charles!
Mr. Charles!

2182
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:45,970
You know tonight's show
is segregated?

2183
01:51:46,054 --> 01:51:47,680
The dance floor is whites only.

2184
01:51:47,764 --> 01:51:49,182
Negroes can't leave the balcony.

2185
01:51:49,265 --> 01:51:51,351
That's how it is, man.
You know, this is Georgia.

2186
01:51:51,434 --> 01:51:52,727
You think we don't know that?

2187
01:51:52,811 --> 01:51:55,146
Negroes are persecuted
in this state every day!

2188
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:57,148
Ain't nothing I can do about that.

2189
01:51:57,232 --> 01:52:00,318
I'm an entertainer. And ... and we 
all gotta play Jim Crow down here.

2190
01:52:00,402 --> 01:52:02,153
I'm sorry, man.
Now get out of here, boy.

2191
01:52:02,237 --> 01:52:03,571
It doesn't have to be that way.

2192
01:52:03,655 --> 01:52:05,907
You could change things,
right here and now!

2193
01:52:05,990 --> 01:52:07,617
I'm sorry, son.
Ain't nothing I can do.

2194
01:52:07,659 --> 01:52:09,703
You hear that, boy?
That's the way things are.

2195
01:52:09,786 --> 01:52:11,413
Ain't nothing
or nobody can change it.

2196
01:52:11,496 --> 01:52:14,332
Now get your black ass out of here, 
and take that trash with you!

2197
01:52:14,374 --> 01:52:17,669
Hold on ... hold on. He ... 
he's right. He's right, Jeff.

2198
01:52:17,752 --> 01:52:18,795
Get them on the bus.

2199
01:52:18,878 --> 01:52:19,879
You sure?

2200
01:52:19,963 --> 01:52:21,172
Get them back on the bus!

2201
01:52:21,256 --> 01:52:22,882
Y'all heard him! Y'all heard Ray!

2202
01:52:22,966 --> 01:52:24,718
Back on the bus!

2203
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:26,594
Are you serious?

2204
01:52:27,846 --> 01:52:28,972
Get them on the bus.

2205
01:52:29,013 --> 01:52:30,515
I can't do nothing here.

2206
01:52:30,557 --> 01:52:31,850
Ray, you know me.

2207
01:52:31,933 --> 01:52:35,311
I'm not gonna lose money just 
because you suddenly got religion.

2208
01:52:35,353 --> 01:52:36,521
Ain't nothing I can do, man.

2209
01:52:36,604 --> 01:52:39,024
We have a contract with me.
You break it, I'll sue your ass!

2210
01:52:39,107 --> 01:52:41,192
- I'll win, Ray!
- You gotta do what you gotta do.

2211
01:52:41,276 --> 01:52:42,235
Look, I'll win big!

2212
01:52:42,318 --> 01:52:43,403
Do what you gotta do.

2213
01:52:43,486 --> 01:52:45,238
I told you, I'll own your ass, Ray!

2214
01:52:47,032 --> 01:52:48,199
Thank you, Mr. Charles.

2215
01:52:48,283 --> 01:52:49,659
You could be the first.

2216
01:52:49,701 --> 01:52:51,327
No, thank you, son.
You were right.

2217
01:52:51,411 --> 01:52:52,954
You're right.

2218
01:52:54,581 --> 01:52:56,666
You'll never work Georgia again!

2219
01:52:58,293 --> 01:53:01,713
He filed a lawsuit and
it's more than a fine, Ray.

2220
01:53:02,338 --> 01:53:05,675
This guy's got juice. He can get you 
barred from ever playing Georgia again.

2221
01:53:06,509 --> 01:53:09,804
But he's willing to drop the 
suit if you'll make up the gig.

2222
01:53:10,305 --> 01:53:12,265
Not if it's segregated.

2223
01:53:12,557 --> 01:53:13,516
Ray,

2224
01:53:15,226 --> 01:53:18,188
I admire what you're doing, man,

2225
01:53:18,271 --> 01:53:19,898

our highest-grossing state.

I'm not playing any more to Jim Crow 
joints ever again, did you got that?

2227
01:53:23,985 --> 01:53:25,653
Yeah. I got it.

2228
01:53:26,154 --> 01:53:28,239
Jeff, get those people in here
so we can rehearse.

Yeah. What's going on?

2247
01:54:17,247 --> 01:54:18,581

We have a telegram for you.

2272
01:55:14,345 --> 01:55:15,722
You have to sign for it, sir.

2273
01:55:15,805 --> 01:55:16,806
I'm coming.

2274
01:55:21,603 --> 01:55:24,606
Indianapolis police. Got a report 
of loud music coming from here.

2275
01:55:24,689 --> 01:55:26,816
Where do you think
you're going, pal?

2276
01:55:28,068 --> 01:55:29,652
I'm just going to the bathroom.

2277
01:55:29,694 --> 01:55:31,446
Handcuff this son of a bitch.

2278
01:55:32,155 --> 01:55:35,116
Recognize this, Ray?
Heroin's a felony.

2279
01:55:35,658 --> 01:55:37,619
It ain't like I'm dealing it, man.

2280
01:55:37,702 --> 01:55:39,162
I'm not hurting nobody.

2281
01:55:39,204 --> 01:55:41,122
Oh, no, you're hurting everybody.

2282
01:55:41,331 --> 01:55:44,250
Your jungle music is
poisoning our kids' minds.

2283
01:55:44,334 --> 01:55:46,503
Hey, I'm gonna put
your black ass away forever.

2284
01:55:46,544 --> 01:55:49,964
You have to understand. 
I got ... I got a wife, I got kids.

2285
01:55:50,048 --> 01:55:51,216
I got responsibilities.

2286
01:55:51,257 --> 01:55:53,301
Why don't you tell that story
to these people.

2287
01:55:53,385 --> 01:55:54,761
Bring them in!

2288
01:55:57,722 --> 01:55:59,516
Ray! Was it a setup, Ray?

2289
01:55:59,557 --> 01:56:01,434
How long you been on heroin?

2290
01:56:01,518 --> 01:56:02,894
Come on, Ray.

2291
01:56:02,936 --> 01:56:04,979

01:56:46,730 --> 01:56:47,939
David.

2301
01:56:47,981 --> 01:56:49,441
Uh, uh, Bea, he can stay.

2302
01:56:49,524 --> 01:56:51,109
No. Baby, come on.

2303
01:56:51,568 --> 01:56:52,861
- Bea?
- What?

2304
01:56:54,529 --> 01:56:55,780
You know, since I got back ...

2305
01:56:55,864 --> 01:56:57,490
Since you got out.

2306
01:56:57,699 --> 01:56:58,950
Yeah.

2307
01:56:59,325 --> 01:57:02,912
Well, since I got here, you haven't 
said more than two words to me.

2308
01:57:03,121 --> 01:57:05,081
Ray, what am I supposed to say?

2309
01:57:05,457 --> 01:57:08,001
My words don't seem to
mean much to you anymore.

2310
01:57:08,084 --> 01:57:09,502
Maybe they never did.

2311
01:57:09,586 --> 01:57:11,796
Come on, Bea,
you ... you know I love you.

2312
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:13,590
Are you gonna stop then?

2313
01:57:15,633 --> 01:57:17,719
You know what, Bea, what you
don't understand is ...

2314
01:57:17,802 --> 01:57:20,096
there's a lot of mean-spirited 
people out there.

2315
01:57:21,306 --> 01:57:22,265
Yeah.

2316
01:57:27,312 --> 01:57:28,438
Ray?

2317
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:34,861
You know, I had to bring Junior 
home from school today ...

2318
01:57:34,944 --> 01:57:36,780
'cause of what
the other kids were sayin'.

2319
01:57:36,821 --> 01:57:38,323
They got mean-ass kids
around here.

2320
01:57:38,365 --> 01:57:40,325
I think we should move
to Beverly Hills.

2321
01:57:40,367 --> 01:57:41,910
No, no, Ray,
we're not gonna move.

2322
01:57:41,993 --> 01:57:43,953
'Cause it ... it's not
about where we live, Ray.

2323
01:57:43,995 --> 01:57:46,373
It's about what you're doing
to yourself.

2324
01:57:46,664 --> 01:57:48,291
And those boys worship you.

2325
01:57:48,333 --> 01:57:50,752
You want them to end up
using that poison, too?

2326
01:57:50,835 --> 01:57:52,504
Bea, that's not fair.

2327
01:57:52,545 --> 01:57:55,215
What's not fair?
What's not fair, Ray?

2328
01:57:55,298 --> 01:57:57,467
That ... that's a low blow.

2329
01:57:59,844 --> 01:58:00,845
Hello?

2330
01:58:02,347 --> 01:58:05,600
Don't jive me, Milt.
Don't jive me, man!

2331
01:58:05,683 --> 01:58:06,810
Really?

2332
01:58:07,143 --> 01:58:10,730
Ah, good, good, good. Tell ... 
tell Sam I said thank you.

2333
01:58:10,814 --> 01:58:12,816
All right. All right, then.

2334
01:58:14,359 --> 01:58:15,402
Oh, yeah!

2335
01:58:15,485 --> 01:58:18,196
What, Ray?
What? Come on, now.

2336
01:58:18,238 --> 01:58:20,073
Ray, tell me what happened.

2337
01:58:20,156 --> 01:58:22,367
ABC got the case dropped.

2338
01:58:22,409 --> 01:58:24,202
The police didn't have a warrant.

2339
01:58:24,285 --> 01:58:25,453
They bought them off.

2340
01:58:25,537 --> 01:58:27,497
Damn it, Bea, do you
want me to go to prison?

2341
01:58:27,539 --> 01:58:30,041
No. Ray, I want you
to stop lying to yourself,

2342
01:58:30,083 --> 01:58:32,168
and they are making that
completely impossible.

2343
01:58:32,252 --> 01:58:33,795
You know what,
you don't understand.

2344
01:58:33,878 --> 01:58:35,547
Then make me understand, Ray!

2345
01:58:35,630 --> 01:58:39,008
Baby, when I walk out that door, 
I walk out alone in the dark!

2346
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:40,468
I'm trying to do something ...

2347
01:58:40,552 --> 01:58:43,221
that ain't nobody ever done
in music and business.

2348
01:58:43,304 --> 01:58:45,974
But I can't do it if I'm alone
everywhere I go.

2349
01:58:46,558 --> 01:58:48,893
I don't want to be alone here, Bea.

2350
01:58:48,977 --> 01:58:50,729
Not in my own home.

2351
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:57,027
Look, Bea,
if you don't understand me,

2352
01:58:57,902 --> 01:58:59,446
then who will?

2353
01:59:05,994 --> 01:59:07,579
I don't know, Ray.

2354
01:59:11,207 --> 01:59:13,543
David? I'm coming!

2355
01:59:14,627 --> 01:59:16,087
Mama's coming!

2356
01:59:19,924 --> 01:59:23,845
Ray, we pull you out of the fire,
and you want country music?

2357
01:59:23,928 --> 01:59:27,015
Look here, I've been singing
country music all my life.

2358
01:59:27,098 --> 01:59:29,559
As a matter of fact, I used to 
play with the Florida Playboys.

2359
01:59:29,642 --> 01:59:31,144
We made a big investment in you ...

2360
01:59:31,227 --> 01:59:32,687
and it's paying off handsomely.

2361
01:59:32,771 --> 01:59:34,439
For both of us, I might add.

2362
01:59:34,522 --> 01:59:36,066
We don't want to lose your fan base.

2363
01:59:36,149 --> 01:59:38,234
Yeah, you know,
you got a point there,

2364
01:59:38,276 --> 01:59:41,738
but I actually think that we have 
more to gain than we do to lose.

2365
01:59:42,697 --> 01:59:45,367
Ray, it's a bad idea.

2366
01:59:47,410 --> 01:59:49,829
When I came to ABC, you guys
put in the contract ...

2367
01:59:49,913 --> 01:59:51,956
that I can choose my own music.

2368
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:54,584
You want to read that paragraph?

2369
01:59:58,797 --> 02:00:00,507
It's on page three.

2370
02:00:01,841 --> 02:00:03,426
I don't need to see it.

2371
02:00:12,811 --> 02:00:15,021
Good evening, Saint Louis.

2372
02:00:15,105 --> 02:00:17,482
It's time
for the main attraction.

2373
02:00:17,524 --> 02:00:21,111
The innovator of soul.
The genius himself.

2374
02:00:21,444 --> 02:00:23,238
Ray Charles!

2375
02:00:42,674 --> 02:00:43,842
Go on, go on, Ray!

2376
02:00:49,013 --> 02:00:50,265
Thank you so much.

lot of y'all don't know that ...

02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:56,730
I ... I was brought up in the South.

2379
02:00:56,813 --> 02:00:59,941
You know, every time you turn 
on the radio there in the South,

2380
02:01:00,025 --> 02:01:01,359
you hear the Grand Ole Opry.

2381
02:01:01,443 --> 02:01:04,571
That's what I grew up singing,
so I hope you don't mind,

2382
02:01:05,196 --> 02:01:08,700

Ray, man, you're amazing.

I'm gonna tell you something. Country 
music. You know why they like it?

2424
02:03:32,135 --> 02:03:34,262
The stories, man.
They got great stories.

2425
02:03:34,345 --> 02:03:35,388
Hey, Joe.

2426
02:03:35,472 --> 02:03:38,850
Ray, I want to introduce you to 
Joe Adams. Hal Ziegler hired Joe ...

2427
02:03:38,892 --> 02:03:41,269
as the announcer
for the rest of the tour.

2428
02:03:41,353 --> 02:03:43,855
I know you, Mayor of Melody.

2429
02:03:43,938 --> 02:03:46,399
I used to listen to your
radio show in L.A. In the '50s.

2430
02:03:46,483 --> 02:03:49,027
We've both come a ways since then.

2431
02:03:49,110 --> 02:03:51,738
What was that counting
you were doing back there?

2432
02:03:51,863 --> 02:03:54,407
I was cueing down the lights.
That shuts up the audience ...

2433
02:03:54,491 --> 02:03:57,118
so you can sing your ballad
instead of having to scream it.

2434
02:03:57,202 --> 02:03:59,496
Hey, well, I'll be damned.
Who told you to do that?

2435
02:03:59,537 --> 02:04:01,289
No one. It just needed to be done.

2436
02:04:01,373 --> 02:04:03,208
See, that's what I'm talking about.

2437
02:04:03,291 --> 02:04:06,211
I like to hear a person say
"It needed to be done" ...

2438
02:04:06,252 --> 02:04:07,754
as opposed to a person saying,
"It ain't my job."

2439
02:04:08,879 --> 02:04:09,514
Well, You know ...

2440
02:04:09,714 --> 02:04:11,716
You know, 
tell me about Central Avenue.

2441

2449

We got the cover of Cash Box.

2450
02:04:31,027 --> 02:04:34,239
The nation's hottest album:
"Modern Sounds of Country & Western."

2451
02:04:34,322 --> 02:04:35,365
Man, you are hotter than hell.

That's what they say.

2453
02:04:36,533 --> 02:04:38,910
I've been watchin', your albums 
are going through the roof,

2454
02:04:38,993 --> 02:04:40,745
your concerts are 
always selling out.

I got the instruments!

2458
02:04:46,918 --> 02:04:49,421
Jeff, Joe was in
the film Carmen Jones.

2459
02:04:49,462 --> 02:04:51,005
Who was the director again?

2460
02:04:51,089 --> 02:04:52,132
Otto Preminger.

2461
02:04:52,215 --> 02:04:55,301
He was also on Broadway
with Lena Horne.

2462
02:04:55,427 --> 02:04:57,887
She was the star.
I was supporting.

2463
02:04:58,054 --> 02:04:59,597

2483

You can see the whole L.A.
Basin from there.

2484
02:05:57,781 --> 02:05:59,949
Not even Beverly Hills
has views like that.

You like it, don't you?

2486
02:06:02,786 --> 02:06:04,287
I don't know. I haven't seen it.

Voilà.

2489
02:06:06,956 --> 02:06:10,293
This foyer is designed to impress 
anybody who walks through the door.

2490
02:06:10,335 --> 02:06:13,380
It has a big winding staircase,
just like "Gone With the Wind".

2491
02:06:13,463 --> 02:06:16,633
We should get our portraits 
painted, like Rhett and Scarlett.

2492
02:06:16,841 --> 02:06:18,343
Bea, bring him on in here.

2493
02:06:18,426 --> 02:06:20,845
Ray, wait till you hear
what's waiting in the living room.

2494
02:06:20,887 --> 02:06:21,888
What is it?

2495
02:06:22,013 --> 02:06:25,850
I had them build you a solid 
marble fireplace, two stories high.

2496
02:06:25,934 --> 02:06:28,103
Hot damn! How do you like it, Bea?

2497
02:06:28,186 --> 02:06:29,270
It's awful big.

2498
02:06:29,354 --> 02:06:30,939
It sure is: 8,500 square feet.

2499
02:06:31,022 --> 02:06:32,816
Biggest house in the neighborhood.

2500
02:06:32,857 --> 02:06:34,651
So, does this meet
with your approval?

2501
02:06:34,693 --> 02:06:36,194
Man, this is a palace.

2502
02:06:36,277 --> 02:06:38,780
You think this is big? Wait 
until tomorrow when you see ...

2503
02:06:38,863 --> 02:06:41,157
30,000 square feet
of RPM Incorporated.

2504
02:06:41,199 --> 02:06:42,992
Yeah, headquarters!

2505
02:06:43,034 --> 02:06:45,412

Totally state-of-the-art.

2508
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:52,502
Tom Dowd built an eight-track mixing 
console, two recorders, the works.

2509
02:06:52,544 --> 02:06:54,963
Now, this room is bigger
than most people's houses.

And step over to your

2513
02:07:02,303 --> 02:07:04,222

Ray.

2531
02:07:48,433 --> 02:07:51,936
Yes, I'll get on a plane and 
I'll be there as soon as I can.

2532
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:53,355

Oh, God! H-How?

2535
02:08:00,612 --> 02:08:02,113
She overdosed.

2536
02:08:05,492 --> 02:08:07,285
I didn't start her, Bea.

2537
02:08:08,453 --> 02:08:09,913
I didn't let her do dope around me.

2538
02:08:09,996 --> 02:08:11,956
I ... I just wouldn't
let that happen.

2539
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:15,293
Yes, I'm sure, Ray.
I'm sure you set a fine example.

2540
02:08:19,464 --> 02:08:21,216
What about her baby?

2541
02:08:25,678 --> 02:08:26,971
You knew?

2542
02:08:27,681 --> 02:08:29,724
His name is Charles Wayne.

2543
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:33,937
He was born October 1, in 
New York City. He's 3 years old.

2544
02:08:34,896 --> 02:08:36,398
The baby's fine.

2545
02:08:37,315 --> 02:08:39,109
He's at her sister's.

2546
02:08:40,860 --> 02:08:42,821
All right. I'll start sending 
them some money.

2547
02:08:42,904 --> 02:08:45,990
You don't have to.
I send them money every month.

2548
02:09:10,849 --> 02:09:12,475
In five minutes,
Mr. Charles will be here,

2549
02:09:12,517 --> 02:09:14,019
and he'll be ready to go.

2550
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:15,645
Now the charts
Jeff is handing out ...

2551
02:09:15,687 --> 02:09:18,523
should be turned in
at the conclusion of ...

2552
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:21,192
You're late, that's a $50 fine.

2553
02:09:21,735 --> 02:09:23,194
I ain't late.

2554
02:09:23,236 --> 02:09:25,321
I give them
a 10-minute grace period, Joe.

2555
02:09:25,405 --> 02:09:28,700
Five minutes after two. 
He's late. He'll be charged $50.

2556
02:09:28,783 --> 02:09:31,286
What? You know what?
Where's Ray?

2557
02:09:31,369 --> 02:09:33,705
You don't have to talk to Ray,
you're talking to me.

2558
02:09:33,788 --> 02:09:38,001
I'll talk to whoever I damn well 
please, and it sure as hell ain't you.

Hey, Ray,

2561
02:09:45,383 --> 02:09:49,512
this fool Joe Adams is trying

2563
02:09:51,348 --> 02:09:55,352

The band's still setting up.

2564
02:09:55,935 --> 02:09:57,562
- Jeff don't ...
- Look, I'm not Jeff.

2565
02:09:57,645 --> 02:09:59,397
That's a fact, Jack!

2566
02:10:00,565 --> 02:10:03,234
Ray, you said the band was my thing.

2567
02:10:03,318 --> 02:10:04,778
It is.

2568
02:10:04,861 --> 02:10:07,530
Then, Fathead,
you go on back to rehearsal.

2569
02:10:08,573 --> 02:10:09,908
Ray.

2570
02:10:10,367 --> 02:10:12,786
Ray, you know how it is,
you've been there.

2571
02:10:13,328 --> 02:10:15,663
Fathead, go on now.
Let me handle this.

2572
02:10:15,747 --> 02:10:17,457
Fathead, go on now.

2573
02:10:20,919 --> 02:10:23,004
You want to tell me what the hell
is going on, Ray?

2574
02:10:23,088 --> 02:10:25,090
I'm not doing anything
I haven't been asked to.

2575
02:10:25,173 --> 02:10:26,716
Ray's running a business.

2576
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:29,844
He shouldn't have to waste time
hearing why people were late.

2577
02:10:29,928 --> 02:10:31,721
I'm not talking to you, Joe.

2578
02:10:31,763 --> 02:10:33,515
I'm talking to Ray.

2579
02:10:38,478 --> 02:10:41,439
Ray, now I know you think
I'm soft on the band,

2580
02:10:41,481 --> 02:10:43,858
but those cats would do
whatever I ask.

2581
02:10:43,942 --> 02:10:46,611
But If you come in here with this, 
uh, "running a business" crap,

2582
02:10:46,653 --> 02:10:48,905
you're gonna lose some good people.
I'm telling you, Ray.

2583
02:10:48,947 --> 02:10:51,366
There are musicians waiting in 
line to play with Ray Charles.

2584
02:10:51,449 --> 02:10:54,285
Not for long,
once they get a taste of you.

2585
02:10:54,953 --> 02:10:57,163
Ray, you're the leader, man.
Be one! Come on, now.

2586
02:10:57,247 --> 02:10:59,249
You now what Jeff, I mean
things have changed.

2587
02:10:59,290 --> 02:11:02,377
It ain't like the days when it was 
seven of us on the Chitlin' Circuit.

2588
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:05,922
I mean, if you weren't busy building 
a bowling alley, you'd seen that.

2589
02:11:06,297 --> 02:11:08,133
So you know about that, huh?

2590
02:11:08,591 --> 02:11:10,510
I know about everything.

2591
02:11:11,136 --> 02:11:13,096
I'm just trying to figure out
how you did it.

2592
02:11:13,179 --> 02:11:14,806
You think
I'm stealing from you, Ray?

2593
02:11:14,889 --> 02:11:18,143
If the Shaw Agency is gonna give you 
a cut of the 10% I'm given them.

2594
02:11:18,226 --> 02:11:21,187
I might as well keep the 
goddamn money in my pocket.

2595
02:11:21,479 --> 02:11:23,773
Leave us alone. We need to talk.

2596
02:11:24,858 --> 02:11:25,942
Ray.

2597
02:11:26,359 --> 02:11:28,403
You can step outside, Joe.

2598
02:11:30,238 --> 02:11:32,032
I'll be in my office.

2599
02:11:37,495 --> 02:11:41,374
Ray, now I know that jealous bastard
planted that lie in your head.

2600
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:45,003
But I have never stolen
from you, Ray, and I never will.

2601
02:11:45,045 --> 02:11:48,882
I got a small business loan, and, yeah, 
Milt Shaw was giving me a little extra,

2602
02:11:48,965 --> 02:11:50,592
but I'm not a thief, Ray.

2603
02:11:50,675 --> 02:11:52,010
Then what about that, Jeff, huh?

2604
02:11:52,052 --> 02:11:56,139
A promoter swearing you did side deals 
with him so you could split my overages!

2605
02:11:56,222 --> 02:11:58,099
How could you do that to me?

2606
02:11:58,183 --> 02:12:00,268
We've been through so much,
we be so like brothers.

2607
02:12:00,352 --> 02:12:02,062
You know what, Ray?

2608
02:12:03,146 --> 02:12:06,149
If we were like brothers,

2609
02:12:06,483 --> 02:12:08,902
why are you paying Joe
more than you're paying me?

2610
02:12:08,985 --> 02:12:11,363
Damn all that!
You broke my heart, man.

2611
02:12:11,404 --> 02:12:15,742
Well, you know what, Ray? You broke 
mine a long goddamn time ago!

2612
02:12:16,576 --> 02:12:18,536
Well, then there it is.

2613
02:12:25,168 --> 02:12:26,795
You know something, Ray?

2614
02:12:26,878 --> 02:12:28,671
You're going to get yours one day.

2615
02:12:28,713 --> 02:12:32,550
And I pray to God that he has mercy 
on your soul, you son of a bitch!

2616
02:12:40,308 --> 02:12:42,352
Everything all right, Ray?

2617
02:12:43,561 --> 02:12:45,897
How the hell do you think it is?

2618
02:12:56,574 --> 02:12:59,911
Go tell him. Go tell him!
Go, go tell him.

2619
02:13:01,496 --> 02:13:02,872
Hey, Dad. Hi, there.

2620
02:13:02,914 --> 02:13:04,958
I made the all-star team!
The game's on Thursday.

2621
02:13:05,041 --> 02:13:06,084
Oh, that's great.

2622
02:13:06,167 --> 02:13:08,920
Oh, damn! I'm not gonna be in town.
I'm gotta go on tour.

2623
02:13:08,962 --> 02:13:11,548
How about I buy you guys
new uniforms, huh?

2624
02:13:11,631 --> 02:13:13,675
Tell the coach I don't care
how much they cost.

2625
02:13:13,758 --> 02:13:14,676
Okay.

2626
02:13:14,759 --> 02:13:17,303
All right, son, you want to take
your dad's briefcase inside.

2627
02:13:17,387 --> 02:13:20,015
The plane to Montreal leaves at 11:00.
I'll pick you up at 8:30.

2628
02:13:20,098 --> 02:13:21,057
All right.

2629
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:23,560
Did you hear what
Ray Junior said to you?

2630
02:13:23,601 --> 02:13:24,561
Yeah.

2631
02:13:24,602 --> 02:13:26,938
Do you know how much making the 
all-star team means to him?

2632
02:13:27,022 --> 02:13:29,482
I know. I got things on my mind.
We had to fire Jeff.

2633
02:13:29,566 --> 02:13:30,567
What?

2634
02:13:30,608 --> 02:13:31,651
He was stealing.

2635
02:13:31,735 --> 02:13:32,819
- Jeff?
- Hmm.

2636
02:13:32,902 --> 02:13:34,195
I don't believe it.

2637
02:13:34,279 --> 02:13:36,239
Yeah, well, 
we're better without him.

U.S. Customs!

2648
02:14:40,887 --> 02:14:43,181
We're goanna need to see some 
identification, please.

2649
02:14:43,264 --> 02:14:45,016
You just arrived from Montreal?

2650
02:14:45,058 --> 02:14:46,476
Yes. Is there a problem?

2651
02:14:46,518 --> 02:14:48,853
We were alerted there might 
be drugs on this plane.

2652
02:14:48,937 --> 02:14:51,314
What? That's outrageous!
I'm going to call our lawyer.

2653
02:14:51,356 --> 02:14:53,608
No lawyers
at international checkpoints.

2654
02:14:53,692 --> 02:14:56,194
Now, we're going to have to 
search everyone on this plane.

2655
02:14:56,277 --> 02:14:59,030
Mr. Charles, if you don't mind
we'd like to start with you.

2656
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:00,949
I'd like to see your overcoat.

2657
02:15:01,032 --> 02:15:02,242
I don't mind.

2658
02:15:02,325 --> 02:15:03,702
Don't say anything, Ray.

2659
02:15:04,369 --> 02:15:05,412
What's this?

2660
02:15:07,372 --> 02:15:09,749
Ray, this isn't some judge
in Indiana.

2661
02:15:09,833 --> 02:15:11,876
It's federal. 
They can charge you with smuggling ...

2662
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:13,670
which can mean real prison time.

2663
02:15:14,963 --> 02:15:17,966
Our lawyers will do
what they can, but ...

2664
02:15:37,736 --> 02:15:39,070
Hello.

2665
02:15:41,197 --> 02:15:43,074
You can't hide out
in here forever, Ray.

2666
02:15:43,116 --> 02:15:44,951
Look, it's my house.
I'm not in prison yet.

2667
02:15:45,035 --> 02:15:46,077
No, it's my house.

2668
02:15:46,161 --> 02:15:49,039
You ain't been here more than 
six days since we moved in.

2669
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:51,166
No, Ray, no! 
A needle ain't gonna solve this!

2670
02:15:51,249 --> 02:15:52,208
Get out of the way. Move!

2671
02:15:52,250 --> 02:15:54,085
Only thing
that can help you is God, Ray.

2672
02:15:54,169 --> 02:15:56,880
Don't think of God? Do you have any 
idea how it feels to go blind ...

2673
02:15:56,921 --> 02:15:58,381
and still be afraid of the dark?

2674
02:15:58,423 --> 02:16:01,593
And every day, you stand pray for just 
a little light, and you get nothing.

2675
02:16:01,676 --> 02:16:03,511
'Cause God don't listen
to people like me.

2676
02:16:03,595 --> 02:16:04,637
Stop talking like that.

2677
02:16:04,721 --> 02:16:07,599
As far as I'm concerned, me and 
God is even and I do what I please.

2678
02:16:07,682 --> 02:16:09,726
If goddamn it, if I want 
to shoot up, I shoot up.

2679
02:16:09,809 --> 02:16:12,520
Then go ahead!
But you walk out that door ...

2680
02:16:12,604 --> 02:16:14,939
and I'm doing something I should 
have done a long time ago.

2681
02:16:15,023 --> 02:16:16,775
I'm taking my boys and I'll leave.

2682
02:16:16,816 --> 02:16:18,860
You're not going away.
You ... you have no place to go.

2683
02:16:18,943 --> 02:16:20,445
- No place?
- No.

2684
02:16:20,528 --> 02:16:22,614
You think I'm scared of losing this?

2685
02:16:22,697 --> 02:16:25,617
Ray, the only thing I was
ever scared of losing was you.

2686
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:28,828
Because where was I ever gonna 
find another Ray Robinson?

2687
02:16:30,330 --> 02:16:32,916
So I put up with
some terrible stuff.

2688
02:16:33,124 --> 02:16:34,959
Maybe that makes me part to blame.

2689
02:16:35,043 --> 02:16:36,378
But I ain't scared no more.

2690
02:16:36,461 --> 02:16:39,130
You know I love you and those 
boys more than anything.

2691
02:16:39,214 --> 02:16:41,633
That is a damn lie
and you know it!

2692
02:16:43,176 --> 02:16:44,844
You ever look at this?

2693
02:16:45,095 --> 02:16:47,347
Really look at it, Ray!

2694
02:16:47,681 --> 02:16:50,767
Ray Charles Junior's
"Most Valuable Player."

2695
02:16:52,185 --> 02:16:54,354
He was so proud this day,

2696
02:16:55,438 --> 02:16:59,317
until you came home too loaded
to go to his banquet.

2697
02:16:59,359 --> 02:17:02,654
No! No! There is something you 
love more than me and them boys,

2698
02:17:02,696 --> 02:17:05,365
more than all the women you 
ever slept with on the road,

2699
02:17:05,448 --> 02:17:07,075
more than all
the dope you ever took.

2700
02:17:07,158 --> 02:17:09,494
- What are you talking about?
- Your music.

2701
02:17:11,371 --> 02:17:13,707
And if you don't stop
using that needle,

2702
02:17:13,832 --> 02:17:16,960
they're gonna take away your 
music and put you in jail.

2703
02:17:20,839 --> 02:17:23,174
Is that poison
worth losing everything?

2704
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:06,968
Mr. Charles?

2705
02:18:19,356 --> 02:18:20,857
Mr. Charles.

2706
02:18:21,524 --> 02:18:23,318
You don't have to go through this.

2707
02:18:24,194 --> 02:18:28,031
We have a substitute that can 
help wean you off heroin.

2708
02:18:28,365 --> 02:18:32,577
I have to do it on my own.
I can do it. I can do it.

2709
02:18:33,286 --> 02:18:34,746
Ah. Don't touch me.

2710
02:18:38,083 --> 02:18:39,417
All right.

2711
02:18:39,918 --> 02:18:41,628
We'll do it your way.

2712
02:18:52,722 --> 02:18:54,057
Doctor?

2713
02:18:54,307 --> 02:18:57,352
Mr. Charles. Mr. Charles,
I'm coming.

2714
02:18:58,103 --> 02:18:59,813
He's got no fluids left.

2715
02:18:59,938 --> 02:19:01,690
Get an I.V. in him right away.

2716
02:19:02,107 --> 02:19:03,942
- I'll insert the needle.
- No needles.

2717
02:19:04,025 --> 02:19:05,944
Yes. It's very important.
You need this.

2718
02:19:06,027 --> 02:19:07,946
Runner, I've got a runner!

2719
02:19:08,613 --> 02:19:09,614
Whoa.

2720
02:19:11,199 --> 02:19:13,618
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Get him on the bed.

2721
02:19:14,202 --> 02:19:16,705
Put those restraints on him.

2722
02:19:17,163 --> 02:19:18,748
No needles.

2723
02:19:37,017 --> 02:19:38,476
No, no.

2724
02:19:39,477 --> 02:19:40,854
Oh.

2725
02:19:44,858 --> 02:19:47,193
George, I miss you.
I miss you, George.

2726
02:19:47,318 --> 02:19:49,654
I miss you.

2727
02:19:54,325 --> 02:19:55,660
Oh.

2728
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:10,425
- Okay. 
- Uh-oh.

2729
02:20:10,508 --> 02:20:12,802
You might be in trouble
right there, Doc.

2730
02:20:21,770 --> 02:20:24,105
Hot damn,
you whupped my ass again!

2731
02:20:24,189 --> 02:20:26,941
I — I'll tell you what, I won't 
lose again the same way twice.

2732
02:20:27,025 --> 02:20:30,487
I spoke with the judge in Boston,
and he'll agree to probation.

2733
02:20:30,779 --> 02:20:33,031
He was impressed with
your attorney's arguments,

2734
02:20:33,114 --> 02:20:35,158
and he believes
you deserve one more chance.

2735
02:20:35,241 --> 02:20:36,659
Oh, that's great.

2736
02:20:36,701 --> 02:20:38,703
But you must complete 
our program ...

2737
02:20:38,870 --> 02:20:40,830
and agree to take 
periodic drug tests.

2738
02:20:40,914 --> 02:20:43,166
You know what. I'll do it.
I know people don't believe ...

2739
02:20:43,208 --> 02:20:45,418
I'm done with this dope,
but I'm finished.

2740
02:20:46,378 --> 02:20:47,712
Who's George?

2741
02:20:52,550 --> 02:20:53,593
Ray,

2742
02:20:54,219 --> 02:20:57,013
you've come through the worst of
the physical reactions.

2743
02:20:57,597 --> 02:21:00,433
We should begin
psychotherapy sessions.

2744
02:21:00,517 --> 02:21:03,103
Uh, look, forget
the head shrinking, Doc.

2745
02:21:03,186 --> 02:21:04,813
I can handle this.

2746
02:21:09,192 --> 02:21:10,610
Mr. Charles,

2747
02:21:10,694 --> 02:21:13,363
you're not the first
celebrity junkie I've treated.

2748
02:21:13,405 --> 02:21:14,531
Junkie? What ...

2749
02:21:14,614 --> 02:21:16,658
Nobody cons me at any price.

2750
02:21:16,741 --> 02:21:17,742
I'm not trying to do that.

2751
02:21:17,826 --> 02:21:21,037
If you want me to give that judge
a positive report,

2752
02:21:21,079 --> 02:21:23,081
you will have to earn it.

2753
02:21:26,543 --> 02:21:27,585
Doc?

2754
02:21:28,545 --> 02:21:30,004
Dr. Hacker?

2755
02:21:30,505 --> 02:21:31,548
Doc?

2756
02:22:03,997 --> 02:22:06,833
Ray, come on, Ray,
play with me!

2757
02:22:10,879 --> 02:22:12,547
He ain't there.

2758
02:22:20,930 --> 02:22:22,766
Talk to me, son.

2759
02:22:23,725 --> 02:22:27,270
I ain't no bad dream.
I'm a part of you.

2760
02:22:27,604 --> 02:22:30,106
Even all that dope
couldn't keep me away.

2761
02:22:33,068 --> 02:22:35,028
Mama, I kept my promise.

2762
02:22:35,153 --> 02:22:37,030
You got strong all right.

2763
02:22:37,113 --> 02:22:38,948
Went places I never dreamed of.

2764
02:22:39,657 --> 02:22:41,910
But you still became a cripple.

2765
02:22:47,665 --> 02:22:49,751
Come here, baby. Come here.

2766
02:22:57,342 --> 02:22:58,510
Ray?

2767
02:23:05,016 --> 02:23:06,768
It wasn't your fault.

2768
02:23:12,190 --> 02:23:13,650
Now promise us ...

2769
02:23:13,942 --> 02:23:15,652
you'll never let
nobody or nothing ...

2770
02:23:15,735 --> 02:23:18,154
turn you into
no cripple ever again.

2771
02:23:18,321 --> 02:23:21,324
That you'll always stand
on your own two feet.

2772
02:23:22,283 --> 02:23:23,451
Promise.

2773
02:23:44,389 --> 02:23:46,433
Today we're here
to right a wrong ...

2774
02:23:46,516 --> 02:23:49,936
that was done to one of our 
native sons nearly 20 years ago.

2775
02:23:50,478 --> 02:23:51,938
In 1961,

2776
02:23:52,522 --> 02:23:55,692
Ray Charles was banned from 
performing in the state of Georgia ...

2777
02:23:55,775 --> 02:23:58,903
because he refused to play
before a segregated audience.

2778
02:23:59,195 --> 02:24:02,157
Thankfully, we've come
a long way since then.

2779
02:24:02,574 --> 02:24:05,910
Some of us have fought for equality 
through the political process,

2780
02:24:06,202 --> 02:24:10,540
but Ray Charles changed American 
culture by touching people's hearts.

2781
02:24:10,874 --> 02:24:14,627
So on this day, March 7, 1979,

2782
02:24:15,170 --> 02:24:18,340
we, the duly elected representatives
of the State of Georgia ...

2783
02:24:18,673 --> 02:24:22,677
not only proclaim "Georgia on My Mind"
our official state song,

2784
02:24:23,011 --> 02:24:26,222
we also offer Mr. Ray Charles
a public apology ...

2785
02:24:26,264 --> 02:24:28,224
and welcome him back home.
