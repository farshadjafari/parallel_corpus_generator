1
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,826
Well, Michelle, we did it.
Happy graduation.

2
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,869
You know,
living at my parents' house,

3
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:45,001
th-that's, um...
that's a temporary thing.

4
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:48,842
Uh, we've been going out
for, what, three years.

5
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,542
You're not, like, getting bored
with things, are you?

6
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:56,088
Michelle, l... I'm gonna ask you something
that I've never asked you before.

7
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,420
Is it kinky?
I don't think so. No.

8
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:04,463
You don't have to be embarrassed if you want
to add more spiciness to our relationship.

9
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,891
Actually, um,

10
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,799
maybe you could just, uh,
you know,

11
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,804
use your napkin.

12
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,774
My napkin?
Mr. Levenstein.

13
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,309
Yes.
You have a phone call.

14
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,107
Excuse me.
Thank you.

15
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,911
- Hello. - Jim, it's Dad.
Uh, you left the ring at home.

16
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,918
The box is empty.
But-But I'm on my way,

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,079
and I've got the...

18
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,749
I've got the ring, so
don't panic, son. Okay?

19
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,723
Bye-bye.

20
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,489
Who was that?

21
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,292
Uh, that was my dad.

22
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,334
That was, uh, my dad. That was, uh...
He couldn't get through on...

23
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,494
I didn't answer my cell.
So he was, uh,

24
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,572
getting all, uh...
was getting all worried.

25
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,665
You know how he is. But everything is,
uh... everything is okay now.

26
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,801
Everything is, uh...
Everything is perfectly fine.

27
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,505
I think I know what you're gonna
ask me.

28
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,851
And it's okay.
L... I don't have to use my napkin.

29
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,854
- Wha...
- I've got my own techniques.

30
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,860
Michelle, where... where are you going?

31
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,829
Michelle? Hey. Hey.

32
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,899
Okay.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,093
Okay, Michelle. Michelle.

34
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:20,366
Okay. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Michelle.

35
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,737
Psst!

36
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,538
Michelle, I think you need to stop.
Okay, keep going.

37
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,808
Oh, my God.
Michelle. Michelle.

38
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,120
Michelle! Oh, my God.

39
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,519
Oh, my God. Okay.

40
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,218
Well, I made it. Where's Michelle?
The washroom?

41
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:44,057
You know, I was so nervous she was
gonna spot me. Here's the ring, son.

42
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,428
Ohh.
Let me tell you something.

43
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,263
This is some ring.
Look at the rock on this baby.

44
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,304
Mr. Big Spender. Hope you didn't
blow your wad on this, son.

45
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,896
Not yet.
Your mother and I...

46
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,533
could not be more
thrilled for you, Jim.

47
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:01,410
I mean, we're so happy. And I know
you're excited. I can see it in your face.

48
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,381
- I mean, you look like you're ready to burst.
- Uh-huh.

49
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,476
I mean, your cheeks, they're flush.
I wish your mother could be here.

50
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,021
Not me. That's what I wish.
You know, this is...

51
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,853
this is one of those moments, Jim,

52
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,257
that you're gonna remember
for the rest of your life.

53
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,556
- Yes, it is.
- You bet it is.

54
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,928
You bet it is.

55
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,230
I cannot believe my son
is gonna pop the question.

56
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,361
- What was that?

57
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,462
Th-That?

58
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,769
That? Knockin' on wood.

59
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,334
And what is this, uh, popping...
popping what? What question?

60
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,778
You are...
Oh, you're a wreck. What...

61
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,941
You need some air.
You need some air.

62
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,110
- Walk me to my car.
- No, I'm not walking you...

63
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,018
- Listen to me.
This is for your own good.

64
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,113
Oh!

65
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,887
Your penis!

66
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,028
Watch your penis.
I got it.

67
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,123
Your pants.
I got the pants!

68
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,135
I got the pants!
Please!

69
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,364
Everybody, please.
Everybody just calm down here.

70
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,736
Everybody, just quiet!
Lower your voice.

71
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,705
It's disgusting!

72
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,614
Now,

73
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,483
I came here to do something...

74
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,318
And, damn it, I'm...
I'm gonna do it.

75
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,962
Michelle.

76
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,565
Hello, dear.

77
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,006
Michelle Anabeth Flaherty,

78
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,543
I love you...

79
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,007
more than I could...

80
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,777
ever explain at this particular moment.

81
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,515
Dad. The ring.

82
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,060
Oh.

83
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,360
Will you marry me?
Yes.

84
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:14,679
My son.

85
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,157
I'm the happiest man in the world.

86
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:35,226
We should all be so happy.

87
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,599
Cheers, gentlemen, sweetheart.

88
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:14,601
I'm impressed.

89
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,369
Marriage is a binding,

90
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:20,536
unifying, eternal,

91
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,911
never-ending, permanent...

92
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,883
chaining together
of two people.

93
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,721
Jim, have you thought this through?

94
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,155
Yes. Yes, Finch.
Thank you.

95
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:35,783
I had actually been trying to figure it
out for a while.

96
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:38,624
You know, when is the right time?
Is there a right time?

97
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:43,191
And finally I realized, duh, you love
the girl, marry her.

98
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,998
Aw.

99
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,596
Oh! Let's dance.
Dance?

100
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:51,437
No.
No, you have to learn sometime.

101
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:54,376
Come on!

102
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,315
Don't laugh at me.

103
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:03,081
Okay, okay.

104
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,315
I'm just glad that's not me.

105
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:10,691
Finch, you don't think there's one girl you're
destined to spend your entire life with?

106
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,921
They're all for me, Kevin.

107
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:17,661
Not, uh... Not so bad, huh?
All right.

108
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,432
Do this.

109
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:22,439
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,066
Well, the wedding should be
rather entertaining.

111
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:40,197
Bro, that's it?

112
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:42,333
There's no keg anywhere.

113
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:46,203
Jim.
Hey, John.

114
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:48,509
The food and the drink
are really bad.

115
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:50,517
"F" for presentation.

116
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:53,383
The good news for you...
What's that?

117
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,922
We're gonna be
ushers at the wedding.

118
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,686
This is amazing.

119
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:03,457
I don't recognize half the people in
this place.

120
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:05,465
At least they all brought gifts.

121
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:08,195
Hello.
Hello. I'm Mary Flaherty.

122
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:10,567
Oh, hello.
Harold Flaherty.

123
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:13,505
Please, please come in.
Lovely to meet you.

124
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:16,236
We've been expecting you.
How was your trip?

125
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:19,711
- Delightful.
- Who's excited about the wedding?

126
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:22,078
Anxious might be more accurate.

127
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:24,083
Oh, w-w-we've never met your son.

128
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:26,085
You'll get to meet him.

129
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:28,121
Rudy and Sam would like to meet him too.
Oh, yes.

130
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:30,418
Better bring them in from the car.
They've been cooped up.

131
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:32,459
Oh, for heaven sakes.
You brought your sons?

132
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:34,825
Our dogs.
We never travel without them.

133
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,921
Oh, my goodness.
Well, honey,

134
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:40,832
why don't you go get those critters out of
the car and we'll start on some cocktails?

135
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:44,997
Ah, thank you.
Right. I'll, uh, get the dogs.

136
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:48,098
There's one thing that'll
make this wedding perfect.

137
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:50,143
No Stifler.

138
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:52,679
Well, that's one dick
we are not inviting.

139
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:55,409
- Motion seconded.
- Motion carried.

140
00:08:55,517 --> 00:09:00,079
So, Finch, what are you gonna do
with that fancy NYU diploma?

141
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:03,954
I'll frame it.
Then I'll write my memoirs.

142
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:07,654
Well, you should come to law school, man.
You know I could use the company.

143
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:10,959
Kids, Michelle's parents are here.
Come on. We're waiting.

144
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,693
Oh, crumbs on the shirt.
That's bad. Okay. That's fine.

145
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:16,178
I'll change. I'll change.

146
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,185
Fuckers.

147
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,566
Well, polish my nuts and
serve me a milk shake.

148
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,780
What's up?

149
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,317
That's right.

150
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:53,650
Oh, cake, huh?
Hope it's good.

151
00:09:55,894 --> 00:10:00,024
Oh, gee. Thanks for inviting me
to the graduation party, fucker.

152
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,734
Oh. Fuckin' right, doggy!
That's good cake!

153
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,308
Holy shit!

154
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,774
Hi. How are you?
Congratulations.

155
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:12,172
Hey.

156
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,324
Congratulation, jism.

157
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,458
Excuse me. Stifler.

158
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:23,400
Hey, Jim.
Stifler.

159
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:25,734
- What are you doing here?
- Happy fuck day, ass mouth.

160
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,001
Put the cake down.
Check it out. I made it myself.

161
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:31,670
That's very cute. What happened to my
invite? Got lost in the mail, fuckface?

162
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:34,077
I don't want to discuss this. Quiet!
Oh, quiet yourself.

163
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,214
I think I can spell...
Seriously, man. Seriously...

164
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:40,446
Jesus! Damn it, Stifler.

165
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:42,784
Jim, look what you did.
Look what I did?

166
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,518
Look at this shit.
What am I supposed to do now?

167
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:48,390
Are you happy now, man?
Why are you here?

168
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:51,431
My dick looks like a corn dog.
I got cake all over my balls.

169
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:54,092
Jim, honey.
Shit.

170
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:57,102
The Flaherty’s are waiting.
You think he's upstairs, honey?

171
00:10:57,204 --> 00:11:00,037
Oh, you're fucked now, Jim.

172
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:07,111
Stifler, get up.

173
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:10,183
This dog's great!
Is it weird that it feels good?

174
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:13,586
All right.

175
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:16,350
What about the dining room?
I know you'll just love him.

176
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:19,392
- Jesus, Stifler.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

177
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:21,893
Stop enjoying it so much.
- Lick it off!

178
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:24,226
Whoo-hoo-hoo.!

179
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:26,891
Son of a... You little shit.

180
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:29,868
- You gotta take your pants off, man.

181
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:35,472
- Jim.
- No, it's not what it looks like.

182
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:38,238
- What are you doing, son? Jim.
- My dogs!

183
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:41,576
Don't go in there. Lord knows what
they'll do to you. I love this dog!

184
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:44,583
- I-I-I was just trying to get him off, Dad.
- That is your son?

185
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,585
Back away from the animal.

186
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:49,247
Hey, great party.
Uh, Mr. And Mrs. Flaherty, I presume.

187
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:51,847
Hey, where are you going?

188
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,587
Well, uh, lunch is, uh, served.

189
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:58,529
L-I really hope that, uh...
that-that we can just...

190
00:11:58,632 --> 00:12:01,601
that we can all just forget about
this and-and-and move on...

191
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:04,432
and start again...
start again fresh.

192
00:12:04,538 --> 00:12:08,975
Jim, if you hope to be the provider and
protector for our firstborn daughter,

193
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,976
you have a long way to go.

194
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,943
Thank you, sir.

195
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:15,277
They think you're an angel...

196
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:18,783
and-and I'm...
I'm just some ungrateful dog-rapist.

197
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:22,413
They just think they raised
a proper, little band girl.

198
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:27,756
And-And besides, sometimes it's...
it's nice to be a little more traditional.

199
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:31,764
How so? How-How do you mean traditional?
I'm thinking about the wedding.

200
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:35,659
Well, it's just this one day.

201
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,331
One day where-where everyone's
eyes are on me for a change.

202
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,908
I've just never walked into a room
and...

203
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:45,069
and had everyone go,
"Ooh," and, "Ahh,"

204
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:47,704
and, "Isn't she elegant?"

205
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:51,649
That is exactly how our wedding is
going to be.

206
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:53,617
I promise.

207
00:12:55,823 --> 00:12:59,691
Shit, I've got a frosted ass crack.
Hey, Finch,

208
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:02,888
you want this for here
or to go?

209
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:06,057
"A witty saying proves nothing."
Voltaire.

210
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:09,295
"Suck my dick."
Ron Jeremy.

211
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:13,388
Oh, boys.
Anybody seen the bride's parents?

212
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:14,958
No? Hmm.

213
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,152
Wait a second.

214
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:19,024
Wait a second.
Come on, Stifler.

215
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,030
This isn't a graduation party.
Time to go.

216
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:24,659
Wait. Hold on.
Jim's getting married, isn't he?

217
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:27,067
Holy fuckin' shit!
This is major!

218
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:31,608
Do you have the slightest idea of how important
this is? We get to have a bachelor party.

219
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:34,769
Yes! We celebrate the death of Jim
with a party in his honor.

220
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,074
Chicks and boobs.
Tits and ass.

221
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:40,480
Titties, ta-tas, casabas, bazoongas
all up in our friggin' faces!

222
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:43,018
Buck up, fellas.
Show some enthusiasm.

223
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,022
It's gonna be fuckin' great.
Oh, my God!

224
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:50,992
Finch, he-he does make
a good point.

225
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:53,063
Yeah, he does.

226
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,532
You never heard me say that.

227
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:01,536
I do not deserve
a girl this cool.

228
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,005
Michelle said the wedding
was doable, right?

229
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:06,201
A wedding.
A wedding, yeah.

230
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,905
You know, I promised her her wedding...
you know, the wedding of her dreams.

231
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:11,675
Okay.
What's the problem?

232
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:14,114
Dancing. Uh, she wants...
she's gonna want to dance.

233
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:17,210
You know, there's that whole tradition:
The first dance at the reception.

234
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:19,881
She's gonna wanna dance
Fred Astaire kind of shit.

235
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:22,221
I can't do that. I can't... She learned
all that from band camp.

236
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:26,157
Okay, so you take lessons,
you know, right away.

237
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:30,666
Lessons. Okay. I have to convince her
parents that I'm not a shithead.

238
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:33,066
Challenging.
Indeed, challenging.

239
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,263
But doable.
What else?

240
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:37,273
What else?
I don't know what else.

241
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,707
That's the thing.
She cares too much to tell me.

242
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,506
She doesn't want me to worry
that she might be worried.

243
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,513
So I'm worried.

244
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:45,877
Recon.

245
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:51,013
You mean, like-like spying on, uh...
like spying on Michelle?

246
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:53,488
Spying is deceitful.

247
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:58,220
Extra attention
means you're concerned.

248
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:02,789
This is... This is true. This is good.
Guys, here's to the next step.

249
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,767
Would you please shut up with that
stepping? Put your glass down.

250
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,127
We'll find a wonderful place somewhere.
I promise. We'll keep looking.

251
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:47,239
Is everything okay in here?
The study can get a little chilly.

252
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:49,471
Do you have enough blankets?
We're fine. Thank you.

253
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,344
L-I was kind of hoping that, uh...

254
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,181
that someday soon
we could have a little talk.

255
00:15:56,287 --> 00:16:00,121
I'd really like to tell you why I think I'll
make a good husband.

256
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:02,351
Whenever you get a chance.

257
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,588
- Oh, why is that?
Come on.

258
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:11,863
See, I was saying that soon...
we could talk.

259
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:16,406
This... This right now is-is sort of
the preliminary talk...

260
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:19,943
before the future... longer talk,

261
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:24,674
which would be like a...
a quiet, uh, private dinner talk.

262
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:27,216
Let him finish.

263
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:31,153
I'm talking to you.

264
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:34,156
Shh.
- Okay.

265
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:38,785
Good talking to you.

266
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,297
No. No, these aren't
gonna work.

267
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:49,538
Wow.

268
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,043
You guys in a sporting goods store.
Very good.

269
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:57,308
Hey, Finch,
I think they got your size.

270
00:16:57,414 --> 00:16:59,314
Aw, beautiful.

271
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,543
Jim needs to learn
to dance for his wedding.

272
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:04,143
You know, I think he's screwed.

273
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,088
Of course he's screwed.
He's getting married.

274
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:09,091
I can't wait to see this disaster.

275
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:11,889
What makes you think
you're invited?

276
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:21,705
I already called up Jim's mom,
got the info.

277
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,705
I'm preparing
for the festivities.

278
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:27,937
It's time for me to boom-boom with
the bridesmaids, Finch-fucker.

279
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:30,946
'Cause I'm gonna hang out
with my wang out.

280
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:35,683
And I'm gonna rock out
with my cock out!

281
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:39,222
Ooh, yep, that's
what I'm talking about.

282
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:41,587
All right, Stifler. Um,

283
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:44,092
this-this is a little, uh,
difficult to explain.

284
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:47,029
Look, you're... you're okay.

285
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:49,929
You're okay.
L-l-I mean, uh... I mean, I like you.

286
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:52,935
Yeah, great.
You can blow me after practice.

287
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:55,130
I'm working, dude.
Well, dude...

288
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:58,970
- Come on. Work it! Hustle!

289
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:02,409
See, my mom didn't know that there
was a misunderstanding. Push it! Move it!

290
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:05,073
- You're not invited!
- Hold!

291
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:11,314
Dude, how the hell do you even
think you're getting married?

292
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:14,789
I've been looking out for your sex
life since high school. You what?

293
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:17,690
Ohhhh! Ohh!

294
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:22,093
The first tits
this guy ever saw...

295
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:23,962
were because of me.

296
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:26,593
The first girl he ever hooked up with...

297
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:29,172
was at my party at my cottage.

298
00:18:29,273 --> 00:18:31,764
That girl is the girl he's marrying.

299
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,469
The Stif-man showed him the way.

300
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:37,945
- Can I get a "Hallelujah"?
- Hallelujah, Stifler!

301
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:40,175
But, my fuckers,

302
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:43,276
this mofo right here does not want
the Stif-meister,

303
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:45,912
the grand, fucking facilitator
to attend the wedding.

304
00:18:46,023 --> 00:18:49,356
Who sucks donkey dick?
Jim sucks donkey dick!

305
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,623
Jim sucks donkey dick!
The answer's no. Okay? I'm sorry.

306
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,630
The answer's no.
I can dance.

307
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:57,667
What?
I can dance.

308
00:18:57,768 --> 00:19:00,703
Jim sucks donkey dick!
Jim sucks donkey dick!

309
00:19:00,804 --> 00:19:03,398
Five, six, seven, eight.

310
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:09,144
Okay. Now-Now what
exactly is this here?

311
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:12,306
Left box turn.
Left box turn.

312
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,385
Hi. Stop looking into
my eyes. Sorry. Sorry.

313
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:17,477
How do you...
How do you know how to do this?

314
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:19,988
My mom made me take it for three fucking years.
Yeah?

315
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,615
Yeah, I hated it.
No, you're really good.

316
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:25,194
Uh, you should take ballet
or something.

317
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:29,130
Fuckface! What part of "This sucks my ass"
do you not under-fuckin'-stand?

318
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:32,725
This is exactly what I'm talking about,
Steven. You can't behave like this.

319
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:36,169
L-l-lf you want to come to the wedding,
I'm sorry, you cannot act like this.

320
00:19:36,273 --> 00:19:38,173
Are you saying
I'm impolite or something?

321
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,675
Impolite would be
an improvement. Look,

322
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:44,145
just... just try not to be,
uh, you know, uh,

323
00:19:44,248 --> 00:19:46,216
you.

324
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:49,918
Fuck this shit.
It's not worth it.

325
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,113
Hey, wait, Stifler.
Stifler, hold on.

326
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:55,419
Wait. Okay. Wh-What if, uh... What if you,
uh, plan the bachelor party?

327
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:58,893
With a dildo show?
Sure.

328
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:01,897
Look. Just... If you can find the time,
uh, to fit it in,

329
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,796
go ahead, surprise me.

330
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,994
Sorry, chief. That only
gets you halfway there.

331
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:07,468
Why? Why ha...
What do you mean?

332
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:10,631
I need assurances that I'm gonna get
some quality action at this wedding.

333
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:12,641
I'm sor... I can't...
I can't make that promise.

334
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:15,268
Well, let me put it to you
this way, Jimbo.

335
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:19,440
No pussy, no dancing. Okay?

336
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:24,852
No pussy, no dancing.
How's that for polite?

337
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:32,220
Jim, your suspicions
are confirmed.

338
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:34,763
Michelle wants a dress
that she can't get.

339
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:38,892
The dress she wants is Amsale.
They have a store in Chicago.

340
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:41,164
Now, if we leave right now,

341
00:20:41,271 --> 00:20:43,034
we can get there by the time they close...
a three-hour drive.

342
00:20:44,758 --> 00:20:46,589
A three-hour drive?
Kick fuckin'ass.

343
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:49,127
Are we going to Chicago
to see titties?

344
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:52,562
We are talking about getting Michelle
a dress in Chicago.

345
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:54,690
Now, please, vanish.

346
00:20:54,801 --> 00:20:57,099
Hey, Finch, what's the capital
of Thailand?

347
00:20:57,203 --> 00:20:59,103
Bangkok!

348
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:02,868
Dude...
Hey, I got shotgun.

349
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,283
Let's get this dress shit over with.

350
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:14,012
The strip bar has got
free hot wings before 7:00.

351
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:17,551
Now, Jim, let me handle this.

352
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:19,852
These are my people.
They're gay?

353
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:23,554
No, you bleeding imbecile.
They have style. They're cultured.

354
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:26,860
- They're sophisticated.
- So they're gay.

355
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:29,867
So, mademoiselle,
I'm sure that you can appreciate...

356
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:33,666
that monsieur here is stuck right between
Scylla and Charybdis.

357
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:36,708
Yes, I'm afraid he's no Ulysses.

358
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:40,472
- Okay, what's happening here?
- You need to speak to my dressmaker.

359
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,880
That's who would actually make the dress.
And I'm afraid Leslie has gone for the day.

360
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:58,327
All right. She-She said she'd probably be
at one of these bars here on Halstead.

361
00:21:58,431 --> 00:22:01,093
I say we split up and ask around
for a Leslie Summers.

362
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,100
Right.

363
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:20,718
Hey there, sweet little thing.

364
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,755
Hey there, you sweet manly thing.

365
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:26,324
You know, I really love your shirt.
Do I know you?

366
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:29,293
I'm Jennifer.
Well, Jennifer,

367
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:32,023
just relax, take it slow...

368
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:34,031
and let the good times roll.

369
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:36,966
'Cause Daddy's a regular here.
Do you want to get a drink?

370
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,368
You're goddamn right I do.
Whoo-hoo!

371
00:22:40,573 --> 00:22:43,508
Whoo. Two cold ones.

372
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,137
Hey, you know, my friend would really
dig your vibe. Will you wait here?

373
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:49,510
Sure thing, babe.
Good.

374
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:51,516
All right.

375
00:22:51,618 --> 00:22:53,552
How you feeling, sexy?
Pretty good.

376
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:55,848
Whoa. You have a deep voice.

377
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:58,389
That's not all.

378
00:22:58,491 --> 00:23:00,391
Oh, right.

379
00:23:00,493 --> 00:23:03,121
You look really cute tonight.
Thanks.

380
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:06,130
I guess. What the...

381
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:10,799
Oh, hey.
Gettin' a little frisky.

382
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:13,463
Oh. Game over.

383
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:15,905
What's happening here?

384
00:23:18,478 --> 00:23:20,378
Hey. Any luck?

385
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,313
- Not so much.
- All right. Let's, uh...

386
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:28,954
This is Bear.

387
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:31,546
Hey.
Wow. You are a bear.

388
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,661
- Yeah.

389
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:38,697
How much you bench?

390
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:41,358
- How much you weigh?
- Why?

391
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,560
You wanna try
and pick me up?

392
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,831
Yeah, I think I could.

393
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:48,270
Yeah, I bet you could.
You are big.

394
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:50,604
I could use
a guy like you on my team.

395
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:55,511
Are you... Are you talking about
our team or an actual team?

396
00:23:55,615 --> 00:23:58,015
What the hell is "our team"?

397
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:00,017
Hi. Where's the girl?

398
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,019
What the fuck
are we talking about?

399
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:04,851
You need to take
another look around.

400
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:13,931
- Hey, honey.! - Oh, my God.
What the fuck is going on?

401
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:19,536
- Come on.
Is that all you got?

402
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:22,574
Pussy!

403
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:25,200
I, uh... I must have came
to the wrong place. Stifler.

404
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:27,438
Stifler.
Oh, man.

405
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:29,606
Hey.
Oh, it's so good to see you.

406
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:32,116
L... How did you get up the nerve
to check out a gay bar?

407
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:35,051
Yeah. Really don't wanna talk about it
right now. I just wanna go home.

408
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:37,247
- Your friend here was just leaving.
- Eat shit.

409
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:39,984
Did you find Leslie?
Fuck your stupid dressmaker, man.

410
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:43,551
- You guys know Leslie Summers?
- Uh, we're trying to find her.

411
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:48,358
You know what? I think you guys are
out of luck. Why don't you go home?

412
00:24:48,468 --> 00:24:50,800
No. Y-You know Leslie... He knows Leslie S...
Okay, look.

413
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:53,667
My friends and I just drove
all the way from Michigan...

414
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:56,469
to find my fiancée the wedding dress
that she deserves.

415
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,171
Now, we need Leslie to make it for us.
Can-Can you please help us find her?

416
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:03,771
I'm sure Leslie always helps
associates of assholes.

417
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:08,181
What are you looking at?
I'm not a steak.

418
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:12,087
Listen, breeder, not every gay man
wants to have sex with you.

419
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:15,024
Oh, yeah?
Listen up, ass jockey.

420
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:17,528
If I were gay, you'd want me.
Really.

421
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,962
Really. I got style.

422
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:22,830
I'm cultured.
I'm sophisticated.

423
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:27,167
And all that just radiates
from your oh, so sexy self.

424
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:29,173
That's bullshit.

425
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:31,266
Everyone wants a piece of the
Stif-meister.

426
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:37,578
Right! Yeah!

427
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:40,848
Without a doubt!

428
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:42,887
- I'll show you fuckers.
- Bye.

429
00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:44,820
Everybody say, "Bye. '"Bye.

430
00:25:44,924 --> 00:25:47,449
Bye.

431
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,688
Bye.
Good luck with the dress.

432
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:55,601
Give us a drink.

433
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:28,629
Mother of God.

434
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:47,582
Bitch!

435
00:26:54,994 --> 00:26:58,555
Whoo-hoo.!

436
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:01,189
What is this, a dance-off?

437
00:27:03,803 --> 00:27:05,361
Oh, yeah?

438
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,343
Go, big boy.!

439
00:28:35,828 --> 00:28:37,728
I love you!

440
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,764
What?

441
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:42,425
Fabulous. Seeing that
was worth anything.

442
00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:45,470
Look, I'm Leslie Summers,
and you've got yourself a dress.

443
00:28:47,273 --> 00:28:49,298
Thank you. Oh, my God.
Thank you.

444
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:51,876
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

445
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:55,641
Yeah, no problem.
Hey, who's your friend? Uh, K-Kevin.

446
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:03,013
Was that the best night
ever or what? Stifler,

447
00:29:03,122 --> 00:29:05,283
are you... are you kidding me?
It was amazing.

448
00:29:05,391 --> 00:29:08,360
Hey, guys!
Hey, hey.

449
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:12,488
Hey, when you get your bachelor party
together, I manage some girls in town.

450
00:29:12,598 --> 00:29:15,590
Real ones.
All right.

451
00:29:16,836 --> 00:29:19,771
Call me. Damn, Stiffy,
you got some moves.

452
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:31,040
Told you that guy
wanted to fuck me.

453
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,313
I can't believe this. They're really
gonna make the dress for me?

454
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,288
They are expecting your call.
Go ahead. This is so cool. Oh.

455
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:40,484
I love you.

456
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:42,561
Thank you.

457
00:29:46,565 --> 00:29:48,999
Well, that worked out.

458
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:52,502
Well, maybe it's time we have
that special dinner chat.

459
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:54,630
I'll have turkey.

460
00:29:59,078 --> 00:30:00,978
Thanks for helping out.

461
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,776
We're so close, and there's still so
much to do.

462
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:07,886
Cadence!

463
00:30:19,198 --> 00:30:22,599
Hey.
Hi.

464
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:26,467
Cadence, this is Paul Finch. Finch,
meet my younger sister, Cadence.

465
00:30:26,572 --> 00:30:29,234
Nice to meet you.
You're reading Descartes.

466
00:30:29,341 --> 00:30:31,241
Yep.

467
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:34,506
Cogito ergo sum.
"I think, therefore I am."

468
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:37,776
Hungry.

469
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:40,818
Hungry.

470
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,081
So, when's Mark getting in?

471
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:46,647
Uh, let's see,
that would be never.

472
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:49,557
Did you guys break up?
How tragic.

473
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:51,857
Uh, sorry, Paul Finch.
Girl stuff.

474
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:03,174
Just stay calm. I'm available,
she's available. It's all good.

475
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:07,402
She's a beautiful girl,
and you're you.

476
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:11,315
I dumped him.

477
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:15,285
But it was Mark. I thought
you really liked him. He was nice.

478
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:20,188
Yeah, but sometimes nice isn't so nice.

479
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:22,317
W-Wait. Hold on.
Let me get this straight.

480
00:31:22,428 --> 00:31:25,795
He didn't want to do it. He said he
didn't want to ruin what we had...

481
00:31:25,898 --> 00:31:27,798
by deflowering ourselves.

482
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,800
Who the hell uses
the word deflower?

483
00:31:31,837 --> 00:31:35,238
That's like something Mom would say.
Yeah.

484
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:38,538
And I'm starting to realize that Mom and
Dad's idea of appropriate behaviour...

485
00:31:38,644 --> 00:31:40,578
might be a little bit different than mine.

486
00:31:41,914 --> 00:31:43,814
Mitch, you're in love.
Shh.

487
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:46,043
You're getting married.
I mean, what's this like?

488
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:49,713
It's like it's...
I'm never gonna be able to explain it.

489
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:54,350
I wanted us to write our own vows for
the wedding, and now I can't do mine.

490
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,758
L... How do you explain love?

491
00:31:56,862 --> 00:31:59,763
Uh, l-I guess
I wouldn't know.

492
00:31:59,865 --> 00:32:03,028
I don't think I've ever
felt that way about a guy.

493
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:06,127
Oh, someday you will.
Maybe.

494
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:09,901
But in the meantime, I don't think it would
hurt to get a little rowdy this weekend.

495
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:12,204
Jim's got single friends,
right? Yes.

496
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:15,769
- Think Finch is a possibility?
- Oh, Finch is boneable.

497
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:18,611
Yes, he is boneable.

498
00:32:22,054 --> 00:32:26,115
Dickhead. You do not send shit
to my office at school.

499
00:32:26,225 --> 00:32:28,785
Hey, Stifler. Why don't you come in
and make yourself comfortable?

500
00:32:28,894 --> 00:32:31,920
Your letter made a great impression on
Coach Marshall when he read it.

501
00:32:32,031 --> 00:32:34,295
Let me just refresh your memory,
partner. "Dear Steve,

502
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,268
I will be forever in your debt if you teach
me to dance like you did in the gay bar."

503
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,270
I put serious thought
into that letter.

504
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:44,206
"Don't push me 'cause I'm
close to the edge.

505
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,746
I'm trying not to
lose my head." Uh-huh.

506
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:49,814
Uh-huh.

507
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:54,384
These are really nice. I mean,
for a bridesmaid dress.

508
00:32:54,486 --> 00:32:56,920
- At least something you can actually
wear again. - Wear again.

509
00:32:57,022 --> 00:33:00,321
But you don't think
it's too sexy, do you?

510
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:04,157
I mean, I don't want to seem slutty or anything.
I'm trying to attract a decent guy here.

511
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:08,063
It's a wedding.
They'll all be decent guys.

512
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:11,136
I just don't feel quite like a virgin in it.

513
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:13,137
Oh!

514
00:33:15,808 --> 00:33:19,005
So, you guys have to be psyched
to be done with college.

515
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:22,478
I mean, I swear, I'm running out of
room in my brain for everything.

516
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:25,141
There's always room for
Plato and Aristotle.

517
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:28,277
Some of my favourites.

518
00:33:29,388 --> 00:33:31,447
Excuse me, guys.

519
00:33:31,557 --> 00:33:34,526
Finch,
she thinks you were being sarcastic.

520
00:33:34,627 --> 00:33:38,324
Okay. It's so good to see you.

521
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,331
You want some help? Here. Let me...
Let me help you out there.

522
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:44,960
There you go. Okay.
You keep fighting the good fight, sir.

523
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:49,072
It's great.

524
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:51,108
That was really sweet of you.

525
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,304
Yeah. I love old people.

526
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:59,084
Hey, I hate to be nosy
and impolite, but, um,

527
00:33:59,184 --> 00:34:02,051
do you know Jim Levenstein and
Michelle Flaherty? Yeah.

528
00:34:02,154 --> 00:34:04,622
Are they here?
Well, I'm Cadence, Michelle's sister.

529
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:07,783
I had no idea.
I'm their good friend Steven.

530
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:10,327
Well, it's nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.

531
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:13,193
Well, they're around town doing
some wedding stuff. That's cool.

532
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:16,530
But there's still a few of us in the
other room if you want to join us.

533
00:34:16,635 --> 00:34:21,334
I don't know. I mean, you look so nice,
I feel underdressed.

534
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:25,633
Well, I think you look great.
Thank you.

535
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:29,236
Oh, here they are.
Hi, boys. Don't stand up.

536
00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:33,246
- The dads aren't here yet?
- I'll go find him.

537
00:34:33,352 --> 00:34:35,877
Now, which one of you
is the best man?

538
00:34:35,988 --> 00:34:39,981
Jim didn't pick just one.
Or I mean, he-he couldn't decide.

539
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:43,721
- Hey, Paul. Hey, Kevin.
- Mom, I want you to meet Steven.

540
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:48,289
He's friends of Jim’s and mine and,
oh, everyone's.

541
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,561
You look very familiar,
Steven.

542
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:53,035
Really? Oh, I'm afraid
we've never met. Oh.

543
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:55,265
Oh. Well, we have now.

544
00:34:55,374 --> 00:34:58,673
Oh, looks like you found
Samantha's Sweets.

545
00:34:58,777 --> 00:35:01,769
Oh, yes.
Isn't their chocolate just to die for?

546
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,405
- Oh, well, you have no idea.
- Actually, I do.

547
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,916
I love chocolate more than life itself.
More than life itself.

548
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:09,385
Yes.! I was just saying
to your friends that...

549
00:35:09,488 --> 00:35:12,548
I have something
very precious here.

550
00:35:12,658 --> 00:35:14,785
What is it?

551
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:18,454
Michelle's grandmother's...
my mother's... wedding ring.

552
00:35:18,564 --> 00:35:20,759
Isn't that precious?

553
00:35:20,866 --> 00:35:23,562
But since all of you
are the best man,

554
00:35:23,669 --> 00:35:25,569
I don't know who should
ho-hold onto it.

555
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:27,730
- I think it's best if l...
- Oh, um...

556
00:35:28,741 --> 00:35:32,268
I think you should get to know us first
and then decide.

557
00:35:33,412 --> 00:35:36,279
You are such a gentleman, Steve.

558
00:35:36,382 --> 00:35:39,545
I hear that all the time, but it never gets old.
Aw.

559
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,846
Hey, Paul, uh, do you have a camera?

560
00:35:41,954 --> 00:35:44,787
How thoughtful.

561
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,121
I must have forgotten
my camera at home, Steven.

562
00:35:48,227 --> 00:35:50,593
Oh, m-maybe you could take,
like, a mental note.

563
00:35:50,696 --> 00:35:53,927
- I won't forget this moment.

564
00:35:54,032 --> 00:35:56,330
I bet you won't.
Would you care to join us?

565
00:35:56,435 --> 00:35:58,460
I would love to.
Thank you. Well, come on.

566
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,630
Lovely to see you fellas.
Thank you.

567
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:08,906
Oh, amazing.

568
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:11,175
What the hell is he doing
near my flowers?

569
00:36:11,283 --> 00:36:13,808
I love the way the tulips
accentuate the, um...

570
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,752
- What do you call those again, sir?
- Double Lisianthus.

571
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:19,790
Lisianthus.
Double "Lisianthums."

572
00:36:19,892 --> 00:36:22,122
What a pretty name.

573
00:36:24,997 --> 00:36:28,262
I told him to be nice,
or-or he couldn't come to the wedding.

574
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:31,700
I will take care of this. I will take care of this.
Hey. Hey, James.

575
00:36:31,804 --> 00:36:34,102
Oh, great. Come on over.
Oh, great. Come on over.

576
00:36:34,206 --> 00:36:36,470
See if I forgot anything.
I don't think... Oh. Oh, oh.

577
00:36:36,575 --> 00:36:38,975
We're having a great time.
I think I've got it all.

578
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:41,011
Oh, look, look, look, look.

579
00:36:41,113 --> 00:36:43,513
- Sahara and Desert Rose...

580
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:45,845
for your bridesmaids' bouquet.

581
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:48,681
Oh, give me that.
Smell this.

582
00:36:48,787 --> 00:36:50,687
It's fantastic.
Fantastic.

583
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:53,451
And, oh... Oh. Oh!

584
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,459
Oh, oh, oh!

585
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:59,395
Look at this.

586
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:03,366
Oh, boy. Let's go look at
the candelabrum, honey.

587
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:05,664
I think with the Summer Blossoms.
Mm-hmm.

588
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:07,671
Cutie.
Thank you for everything.

589
00:37:07,773 --> 00:37:10,401
What do you think, girls?
Isn't this adorable? Bye, Cadence.

590
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:13,672
Okay, I know... I know what you're doing.
Look. Have you seen yourself?

591
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:16,907
I can't believe you're doing this.
Just calm down, dude.

592
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:18,915
It's all set.
What's set?

593
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:22,453
I'm gonna teach you to dance
like a "Baryshiniankov."

594
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:24,988
Oh, yeah.
He is pretty good.

595
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:28,491
Jim, he's not doing it to be nice.
He's doing it to bone Cadence.

596
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:31,791
Look, maybe we should give him a chance.
You know, I think... I think...

597
00:37:31,897 --> 00:37:35,355
that underneath all the fucks
and shits and blow mes,

598
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:39,563
there's a very sensitive person
who is just thirsty for acceptance.

599
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:41,662
That's-That's what I think.

600
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:46,369
Oh, Jim, you've gotta stop masturbating.
It's melting your brain.

601
00:37:46,478 --> 00:37:49,208
Observe the fuckin' Stif-meister.

602
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:51,214
What is his defining characteristic?

603
00:37:52,818 --> 00:37:54,786
He uses the F-word excessively.

604
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:56,821
Thanks, man.

605
00:37:56,922 --> 00:38:00,050
But I also have confidence.
You're one big floppy cock.

606
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:02,285
Look at you.
You've gotta stand like a man.

607
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:04,794
Your posture tells your partner
where to go.

608
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:06,956
Okay. Okay.
Okay?

609
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:09,033
Follow my lead.

610
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:13,535
This is the waltz.
Waltz. Okay.

611
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:16,107
Waltz. Okay.

612
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:21,040
That's pretty good.
You're fuckin' right it's good.

613
00:38:21,146 --> 00:38:23,614
I'm gonna save your ass
in this wedding.

614
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:26,149
Pretty soon you're gonna
want me to shave your balls.

615
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:29,448
Should I shave my balls? Do you shave
your balls? How do you do it?

616
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:31,614
Dude, no.

617
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:35,457
L... l... I'm just...

618
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:37,495
Shaving.

619
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:40,530
You know, there's nothing like
a local pub.

620
00:38:40,632 --> 00:38:42,532
Mm-hmm.
It's like real America...

621
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:46,229
without all that corporateness and catchy jingles.
Well, what's wrong with a good jingle?

622
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:48,966
I think it was Voltaire who said,

623
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:54,242
"A jingle witty proves everything
for my friends and I."

624
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:58,948
- Cadence.

625
00:38:59,051 --> 00:39:00,951
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

626
00:39:01,053 --> 00:39:03,317
You're just in time
for Voltaire's greatest hits.

627
00:39:03,422 --> 00:39:06,619
Voltaire?
Stifler, please, who was Voltaire?

628
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:08,625
Someone much wiser than you,
I'm afraid, Finch.

629
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:13,129
Actually, I'm getting a little burned out
on all the intellectual stuff.

630
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:15,131
Yeah. Me too.

631
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:19,169
Being smart is so hard.

632
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,469
I'll give you some intelligence.

633
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:27,370
Voltaire can suck on my balls.

634
00:39:29,147 --> 00:39:30,705
What?

635
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,307
It's about time somebody
finally came out and said it.

636
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:35,545
Hey, I'm gonna give you a quote to live by.

637
00:39:35,654 --> 00:39:37,554
"Love life, get paid and then get laid."

638
00:39:37,656 --> 00:39:41,148
That is the basic philosophy
of the Finch-meister.

639
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:42,521
I like that.

640
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:45,961
- Bet you do.
- But I don't know why you do...

641
00:39:46,064 --> 00:39:49,295
because Finch-meister doesn't
make any friggin' sense.

642
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:52,370
- Sure, it does.
- No fuckin' shit it does.

643
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,307
Cadence, let's leave
the "crayton" here, shall we?

644
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,571
Whatever. Fuck it.
I'm walkin' anyway.

645
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:04,706
Wait. You know, actually, I think I'm gonna
go stretch my legs with the Finch-meister.

646
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:07,376
- You don't mind, do you, Steven?
- No.

647
00:40:09,655 --> 00:40:11,555
Ha!

648
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:19,095
It's on like Donkey Kong, bi-i-itch.

649
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:21,097
Pack it up, bitch.

650
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,099
I'm on it. Thank you.

651
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:26,329
So, uh, Cadence say
anything about me?

652
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:29,566
Whatever you and Finch are pulling,
she seems to like you both.

653
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:33,270
Finch. Is she gonna be
around tomorrow night?

654
00:40:33,378 --> 00:40:36,506
No, she's going up to Chicago
with Michelle for the final dress fitting.

655
00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:39,880
What about her parents?
I think her mom kind of likes me.

656
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:43,011
They're going up north with,
uh... with my parents...

657
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:46,090
for, uh... you know, to get things, uh,
ready for the rehearsal.

658
00:40:46,191 --> 00:40:48,557
So, uh...
So that's where they'll be.

659
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,060
So don't bother looking for them or anything,
you know.

660
00:40:51,163 --> 00:40:53,358
A wedding.

661
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:57,128
Shit. How do you know
she's the right girl?

662
00:40:57,235 --> 00:40:59,203
I just do.

663
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:02,933
I'm a better person when I'm with Michelle.
Nobody else can... No, no, no, shithead.

664
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:06,636
You hooked up with one other girl for,
what, 10 seconds.

665
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:10,146
Not to mention you passed on Nadia.
Dumbest fuckin' thing ever.

666
00:41:10,248 --> 00:41:12,773
You're like a blind man picking
out his favourite porno.

667
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:14,818
This shit is crazy.

668
00:41:17,956 --> 00:41:20,618
This is just the old pre-wedding jitters,
son.

669
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:23,320
It's so forever, you know. It-It's, uh...

670
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:25,828
You know, Michelle is the only, uh,

671
00:41:25,931 --> 00:41:27,831
girl that I've... I've been with.

672
00:41:27,933 --> 00:41:31,733
Honestly, now... Honestly, would you
have passed up sex with Nadia?

673
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:36,140
Why? Did she say something?

674
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:38,641
Hypothetically, Dad.
Oh, hypothetically.

675
00:41:38,744 --> 00:41:41,269
Well, I mean, you know,
Jim, I'm a married man.

676
00:41:41,379 --> 00:41:43,677
I'm...
If-lf-lf you weren't married.

677
00:41:43,782 --> 00:41:46,808
She's a college girl.
If you were a college guy.

678
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:49,512
In a heartbeat.
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

679
00:41:49,621 --> 00:41:54,490
First of all, what-what you're feeling is
so normal and perfectly natural.

680
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:59,462
Marriage is not about, uh, animal lusting
and-and kinky sex games.

681
00:41:59,564 --> 00:42:04,160
It's not so much about who's the dog
and who's the fire hydrant tonight.

682
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:06,169
It's-It's deeper than that.

683
00:42:06,271 --> 00:42:09,172
The longer a marriage lasts,

684
00:42:09,274 --> 00:42:11,174
uh, the longer you can go,

685
00:42:11,276 --> 00:42:13,176
uh, without sex.

686
00:42:13,278 --> 00:42:16,714
But when that magic night
does happen, uh,

687
00:42:16,815 --> 00:42:18,715
it's-it's all the more meaningful.

688
00:42:18,817 --> 00:42:20,842
And let me tell you,
your mother, bless her,

689
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:23,045
can still make me, uh,
squeal like a pig.

690
00:42:23,155 --> 00:42:26,647
Uh, and I mean that in the good sense, son.
Do you follow what I'm saying?

691
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:29,283
You understand where I'm going?
I do. I, uh... I think I, uh...

692
00:42:29,394 --> 00:42:33,125
Anything else you need?
No. No, that's, uh...

693
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:36,132
Anything I can do.

694
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:58,882
He's not here. Park the cars down
there where he won't see them.

695
00:43:05,597 --> 00:43:08,725
Hoo! Fuckin' right!

696
00:43:09,835 --> 00:43:13,100
So, you like my pants, Stiffy? Whatever,
dude. As long as the girls are worth it.

697
00:43:13,205 --> 00:43:16,936
They're worth it. Oh, and if you've got some
good wine too, that'll score some points for you.

698
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:19,875
- We think there's some in the...
in the basement. - I'll get it.

699
00:43:19,978 --> 00:43:21,878
You ain't gonna want to miss this.

700
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,676
Gentlemen.

701
00:43:24,783 --> 00:43:26,114
Gentlemen, I would like to introduce...

702
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:31,665
Officer Krystal und Fräulein Brandi.

703
00:43:33,074 --> 00:43:35,042
Oh, my God.

704
00:43:35,143 --> 00:43:38,738
Oh.! Oh.! Oh.! Yeah.!

705
00:43:38,847 --> 00:43:42,908
- Oh, my God!
- You boys have been very messy.

706
00:43:47,422 --> 00:43:49,549
Whoops.
Can you see my fanny?

707
00:43:49,657 --> 00:43:51,784
Whoops.

708
00:43:51,893 --> 00:43:53,724
Ohh!

709
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,729
Whoo.!

710
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:58,594
- Oh!

711
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:02,860
- You naughty girl.

712
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:07,903
None of that pleading the Fifth crap!

713
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:10,443
- You boys are gonna talk.
- Uh... Uh...

714
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:12,103
Wow.!

715
00:44:14,249 --> 00:44:16,046
Oh, my God!

716
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,948
Are you just gonna stand there and drool?

717
00:44:19,053 --> 00:44:22,045
- Or are we gonna have a bachelor party?
- Fuck yeah, we are!

718
00:44:22,156 --> 00:44:24,920
Yeah? What?
I can't hear you.

719
00:44:25,026 --> 00:44:29,087
Louder!
Y-Y-Y-Y-Yes. Bachelor party.

720
00:44:29,197 --> 00:44:30,664
Can't hear you.
Louder! Louder!

721
00:44:30,765 --> 00:44:34,257
- Stick a finger in my ass!

722
00:44:36,538 --> 00:44:39,006
- That's weird.
- You just wait.

723
00:44:39,107 --> 00:44:41,974
Look, maybe we should
just wait for... Jim.

724
00:44:42,076 --> 00:44:45,409
- Fuck Jim, man! This is for us.
- Take her top off.

725
00:44:45,513 --> 00:44:48,949
My girlfriend has strict rules
about this. No touching.

726
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:51,951
What are you, a dancing clown?

727
00:44:52,053 --> 00:44:55,648
You wipe that shit-eating grin off
your face, you punk-ass little bitch.

728
00:44:55,757 --> 00:44:58,021
- This is awesome!
Oh, you like that?

729
00:44:58,126 --> 00:44:59,821
You like it, huh?
How much? Boob.

730
00:44:59,928 --> 00:45:01,987
No! Hmph!

731
00:45:02,096 --> 00:45:06,499
I'm sorry. No, not yet.
But you will be.

732
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:09,661
Like I said, this is awesome.

733
00:45:17,211 --> 00:45:21,978
Hey, listen, l-l-l-I think we both know
that Officer Krystal and me have this...

734
00:45:23,084 --> 00:45:25,052
You know. Yeah.
Thing? Mm-hmm.

735
00:45:32,427 --> 00:45:35,692
No one has ever
slapped my ass like that.

736
00:45:35,797 --> 00:45:39,233
No one's ever pinched
my nipple with such ferocity.

737
00:45:45,073 --> 00:45:49,100
l... I'm a master
of the Tantric art.

738
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,303
L-I look at her body...

739
00:45:51,412 --> 00:45:55,041
and I just see the chakras and
the things I can do to her and...

740
00:45:55,149 --> 00:45:57,083
Ohh!

741
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:10,263
You. You look cute.
L... Oh, thank you.

742
00:46:10,365 --> 00:46:12,333
Thank you, but you...
you're the cute one.

743
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:15,266
Stiffy! How slimming
is this, huh?

744
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:18,100
What the fuck,
Buffalo Bill?

745
00:46:18,206 --> 00:46:21,334
What, this... What,
the pink too much?

746
00:46:21,442 --> 00:46:25,538
It puts the dress in the drawer
and it does as it's told.

747
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:29,472
Oh, dude.
Now that's fucked up.

748
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:31,609
That's fucked up.

749
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:34,711
And in closing, you have been
a naughty, naughty girl.

750
00:46:34,822 --> 00:46:37,757
You been naughty, Brandi?
You been fuckin' naughty?

751
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:41,351
Fresh.

752
00:46:41,462 --> 00:46:44,397
Take her top off!

753
00:46:44,499 --> 00:46:48,697
You didn't get to cleaning,
little bitch fucker? Huh? Ow!

754
00:46:50,238 --> 00:46:52,229
Wanna see us kiss?

755
00:46:54,776 --> 00:46:56,744
Fuck, no.
No, no.

756
00:46:56,844 --> 00:46:58,812
None of that
"you go, we go" bullshit.

757
00:46:58,913 --> 00:47:01,143
Already done that.
Very good of you.

758
00:47:13,194 --> 00:47:16,095
I used to have this pet bass.
Oh.

759
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:18,665
His name was Arnie, and...
Oh, he was so cute.

760
00:47:18,766 --> 00:47:20,666
And he just loved me too.
Yeah.

761
00:47:20,768 --> 00:47:22,963
He'd just look up at me...
Maybe you could dance.

762
00:47:23,071 --> 00:47:25,369
And make this face like...

763
00:47:25,473 --> 00:47:29,273
Or something like that. I don't know.
It was great. God, I miss him, but...

764
00:47:29,377 --> 00:47:32,005
Um, sometimes I watch
the Discovery Channel, and...

765
00:47:32,113 --> 00:47:34,343
I don't care!

766
00:47:34,449 --> 00:47:37,612
Could you just dance for me, please?

767
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:40,210
No, that's my favourite...

768
00:47:40,321 --> 00:47:42,983
It was my favourite shirt.
Uh, okay.

769
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:46,618
Hey. What?

770
00:47:48,062 --> 00:47:50,030
Nothin'.

771
00:47:51,132 --> 00:47:53,123
It's a crazy party, huh?

772
00:48:03,211 --> 00:48:05,645
Don't worry about him.
You don't worry about him.

773
00:48:05,747 --> 00:48:10,650
He's... He's a... He's a maniac.
And you're a maniac, you know that?

774
00:48:17,058 --> 00:48:20,221
Stifler, why in the world
are you focused on me?

775
00:48:20,328 --> 00:48:22,125
I'm surprised to see
you don't have tits.

776
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,495
How can I clean you
if you are not dirty?

777
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,627
Go put something on that I must clean
off with my tongue.

778
00:48:29,737 --> 00:48:33,138
Ohh. Anything for a French person.

779
00:48:33,241 --> 00:48:36,176
If you insist, Fräulein.

780
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:49,721
- Ah!

781
00:48:49,824 --> 00:48:51,416
Oh, yeah.

782
00:48:51,526 --> 00:48:53,824
Look at you, you pathetic,
little weasel.

783
00:48:53,928 --> 00:48:55,589
Can't I just watch?

784
00:48:55,696 --> 00:48:59,860
Look, you don't have to do
anything if you don't want to.

785
00:48:59,967 --> 00:49:02,265
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

786
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:04,736
Don't break character ever again.

787
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:08,832
Okay? I don't care if Kevin starts crying
because Finch bit his cock off.

788
00:49:08,943 --> 00:49:13,676
You're a dirty cop, you're a prissy maid
and I am your filthy cabana boy in need
of much punishment and cleaning.

789
00:49:13,781 --> 00:49:16,614
Don't you ever mouth off
to Officer Krystal,

790
00:49:16,717 --> 00:49:18,446
- you dirty, little pervert!
- Okay.

791
00:49:18,553 --> 00:49:21,044
Now, obey!
I obey! I obey!

792
00:49:21,155 --> 00:49:22,452
Jesus!

793
00:49:40,007 --> 00:49:41,998
Guys, are we having dinner?

794
00:49:47,014 --> 00:49:48,914
Here, let me get that.

795
00:49:52,086 --> 00:49:54,281
Holy shit!
Stifler.

796
00:49:54,388 --> 00:49:58,085
I've got something really nice cooking
up for you. Well, we love surprises.

797
00:49:58,192 --> 00:50:02,151
Stifler, you said you spoke to Jim. I did.
I was secret about it and everything.

798
00:50:02,263 --> 00:50:05,596
He said he'd be the only one here
tonight. What the fuck, shit-brick?

799
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,861
Chocolate.
Ah, sh...

800
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:10,733
Now, I told everyone that you were
up north with my parents.

801
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:14,274
Okay. So we won't be bothered. We can
just, uh, totally relax and no worries.

802
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:16,639
Please come on in.

803
00:50:16,744 --> 00:50:18,974
Make yourselves at home.
Right this way. Thank you.

804
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,980
Sir.

805
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:24,916
What?

806
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:27,351
Pink roses.

807
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,355
Pink roses.
Yeah.

808
00:50:30,524 --> 00:50:34,119
They're nice, aren't they?
Yes. Artificial. Nice try.

809
00:50:34,228 --> 00:50:36,992
Well...
I almost got ya.

810
00:50:37,098 --> 00:50:39,396
Yeah. Well.

811
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,765
So, has Michelle ever told you
the story of how we fell in love?

812
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,395
Oh, why don't you retell us now?

813
00:50:45,506 --> 00:50:48,100
It's... It's one of my favourite stories.
Where should I begin?

814
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:50,109
Um...

815
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:52,179
Let's see. Uh...

816
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,341
Well, I suppose, uh...
I suppose it all started at, um...

817
00:51:00,788 --> 00:51:03,518
Tall Oaks.

818
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:05,990
That's-That's right.
At Tall Oaks.

819
00:51:06,093 --> 00:51:09,028
That was the summer when, uh... Oh!

820
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,257
Oh! The summer that was so hot.

821
00:51:11,365 --> 00:51:13,833
So hot.
All right. Look what I got.

822
00:51:13,935 --> 00:51:15,835
Jesus!

823
00:51:15,937 --> 00:51:17,837
Hey there.
Hi there.

824
00:51:17,939 --> 00:51:21,534
Hey.
Jim, I cannot believe you.

825
00:51:23,311 --> 00:51:27,771
- You can't? - You hired help on our
account? That is entirely unnecessary.

826
00:51:27,882 --> 00:51:30,350
But I will have some of that wine, sir.

827
00:51:30,451 --> 00:51:33,852
- Say, "Please," Harold.
- Please. Of course.

828
00:51:33,955 --> 00:51:38,085
Absolutely. It's what he's here for,
is-is the wine, obviously.

829
00:51:38,192 --> 00:51:41,025
Yes. Evidently.
What else would you be here for?

830
00:51:41,128 --> 00:51:46,259
And-And-And I certainly appreciate
your-your-your courtesy, sir.

831
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:48,733
Ah. Uh, well, yes.

832
00:51:48,836 --> 00:51:52,533
Uh, we have... we have right here
a 1999...

833
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,302
cabernet seve... um...

834
00:51:55,409 --> 00:51:59,903
full-bodied, masculine wine.

835
00:52:00,014 --> 00:52:02,915
Just shouts sophistication.

836
00:52:04,585 --> 00:52:06,485
- James.
- Yes.

837
00:52:06,587 --> 00:52:10,421
Well, I can see you're very surprised
to see me here. A little bit.

838
00:52:10,524 --> 00:52:12,856
I'm going to go check on the dogs.
Yes, yes!

839
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,986
In fact, why don't you both
go check on the dogs and...

840
00:52:16,097 --> 00:52:19,533
No, no, no. Don't check on the dogs.
They're fine.

841
00:52:19,633 --> 00:52:22,397
- How do you know?
- Because I just checked on the dogs.

842
00:52:22,503 --> 00:52:25,028
Because he just checked on the dogs.
Good work, man. I did.

843
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:27,505
- Jim, I'll help you with the turkey.
- Okay.

844
00:52:27,608 --> 00:52:30,543
Um, and I'll keep you company.

845
00:52:30,644 --> 00:52:32,544
Thank you. Whoo.

846
00:52:32,646 --> 00:52:35,911
So, how long have you been
a sommelier, Mr., um...

847
00:52:36,017 --> 00:52:38,542
Belvedere, ma'am.
Oh. Belvedere.

848
00:52:39,653 --> 00:52:41,553
It's chilly in here.

849
00:52:41,655 --> 00:52:44,283
So, how long do we have to
stay in here for?

850
00:52:44,392 --> 00:52:46,883
I don't know.
They said to hide.

851
00:52:46,994 --> 00:52:49,292
I guess we'll just wait
for 'em to call us.

852
00:52:49,397 --> 00:52:52,389
Who knows what kind of kinky shit
they're getting ready for us.

853
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,468
Do these go
in your ass tonight or mine?

854
00:52:57,605 --> 00:53:00,130
Do you have a serving dish ready?

855
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:02,188
- Jim.
- Hmm?

856
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:04,590
We need a serving dish.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course.

857
00:53:05,529 --> 00:53:07,497
- Oh!
- What?

858
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:12,358
- Nothing.
- Then why the excitement?

859
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:14,801
I thought, uh, the-the dish was broken.

860
00:53:14,905 --> 00:53:17,100
Well, is it?
No.

861
00:53:17,207 --> 00:53:19,107
Then, are you going to get it?
Yes.

862
00:53:30,053 --> 00:53:32,283
Here you go. One serving dish.
Excellent.

863
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:35,153
Now what we need...
a cutting board.

864
00:53:35,258 --> 00:53:36,850
Huh? No, no, no, no!
Stop! What?

865
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,260
L-I will get it for you.
Nonsense. I can get a cutting board.

866
00:53:41,365 --> 00:53:45,802
Ah, let's see. There you go.
This should do nicely.

867
00:53:45,902 --> 00:53:48,666
I presume we're having
white wine with the turkey.

868
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:50,672
Uh, let me go check.

869
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:58,243
What happened here?

870
00:53:58,348 --> 00:54:01,249
Oh, um, that... that's mud.

871
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:04,752
I meant to clean that up this morning.
How embarrassing.

872
00:54:04,855 --> 00:54:07,415
That's gonna stain.
We're gonna need a mop.

873
00:54:07,524 --> 00:54:08,821
I'll get it.
It's in this closet.

874
00:54:08,925 --> 00:54:12,691
Oh! No, no, no!
No, it's not.

875
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:14,991
- It's in there.
- It's not in this closet...

876
00:54:15,098 --> 00:54:18,693
because l-I, um...
I moved it... I moved it.

877
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:20,736
Well, where?
I'll go get it.

878
00:54:20,837 --> 00:54:23,032
L-I don't...
I don't remember.

879
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,165
You don't remember?

880
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:28,369
You know why I don't remember
is because I actually did not move it.

881
00:54:28,478 --> 00:54:30,946
The cleaning lady did.

882
00:54:31,048 --> 00:54:32,913
Your mother said you don't have
a cleaning lady.

883
00:54:33,016 --> 00:54:36,042
I don't know why she would say such a...
You called, master?

884
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:39,179
Holy...
Well, there you are.

885
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:41,382
Hello.
How do you do?

886
00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:45,459
Uh, so, cleaning lady,

887
00:54:45,562 --> 00:54:48,531
we were wondering
where... where the mop was.

888
00:54:48,632 --> 00:54:51,567
Master put the mop
in my fanny.

889
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:54,228
- You what?
- Who put what where?

890
00:54:54,337 --> 00:54:56,999
I did no such thing anywhere.

891
00:54:57,107 --> 00:54:59,598
Shall I clean?

892
00:55:01,745 --> 00:55:03,713
Harold.

893
00:55:05,682 --> 00:55:10,016
Very well.
It is so hot in here.

894
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:13,372
- Holy Jesus!

895
00:55:18,645 --> 00:55:22,581
Oh, Brandi, Brandi. What are you doing?
You're not in Eastern Europe anymore.

896
00:55:22,683 --> 00:55:28,383
You can't do that. I am so sorry about my
... my cousin. She's not used to our customs.

897
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:31,549
Jim, I apologize for recommending
her to you.

898
00:55:31,658 --> 00:55:34,286
Oh, here's, uh...
here's this, by the way.

899
00:55:34,395 --> 00:55:37,057
Ah, yeah. Got the mop.

900
00:55:37,164 --> 00:55:40,190
Brandi, you left the mop
in the car. Hmm?

901
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,895
Now remember, it's called a car,
not a fanny.

902
00:55:44,004 --> 00:55:47,838
You remember last time when you wanted
me to take a ride in your fanny? Of course.

903
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:51,638
Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.

904
00:55:51,745 --> 00:55:53,838
You know what?
We should probably just go.

905
00:55:53,947 --> 00:55:57,508
I'm so sorry about this. I just came by
to make sure everything was in order.

906
00:55:57,618 --> 00:56:00,451
Ooh, food smells great!

907
00:56:00,554 --> 00:56:02,818
Au revoir.

908
00:56:02,923 --> 00:56:05,323
Jim, you have unique friends.

909
00:56:06,427 --> 00:56:08,895
Harold!
Let's get that cleaned up.

910
00:56:08,996 --> 00:56:12,090
Um, I think I saw some Pine-Sol in
here too.

911
00:56:12,199 --> 00:56:15,760
Aye-yay-yay.
Oh, my God!

912
00:56:15,869 --> 00:56:17,803
Oh, my Lord.!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

913
00:56:17,905 --> 00:56:20,339
He's okay. Are you all right?
Are you okay?

914
00:56:20,441 --> 00:56:23,035
Who did this to you? I'm sure he's okay.
Are you okay?

915
00:56:23,143 --> 00:56:26,806
Get some help! Harold, call the police!
No, no, please.

916
00:56:26,914 --> 00:56:29,542
- All right!
- Jesus!

917
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:32,016
I'll take charge from here.

918
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:34,679
- They are fast here. And nicely attired.
- What's going on here?

919
00:56:34,788 --> 00:56:37,552
- She's here to protect and serve.
- Quiet!

920
00:56:37,658 --> 00:56:39,853
- Okay.
- Who let this boy out of the closet?

921
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,121
You are all in for
a hard punishment now.

922
00:56:42,229 --> 00:56:44,322
Don't you touch him.
He's been hurt.

923
00:56:44,431 --> 00:56:46,365
- No, this is hurt!
- Ow!

924
00:56:46,467 --> 00:56:48,662
You can't do that.
Silence, fucker!

925
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:50,737
Ow!
Oh, you like it.

926
00:56:50,838 --> 00:56:52,772
Oh!
Harold!

927
00:56:52,873 --> 00:56:55,034
What's gotten into you?
I meant "ow."

928
00:56:55,142 --> 00:56:57,667
Dirty whore!
Shut your hole! Obey!

929
00:56:57,778 --> 00:56:59,973
You can't do that.!

930
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,379
- You're a disgrace to the police force.
- I'll be giving you an enema!

931
00:57:03,484 --> 00:57:05,714
Hey, somebody untie me.!

932
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:09,016
Back off! All right, forget it.
We give up.

933
00:57:09,122 --> 00:57:11,352
Oh, Steven! Steven!

934
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:14,256
Oh, it's okay, Mary.
What's going on?

935
00:57:14,361 --> 00:57:16,329
Listen. This isn't
working, guys.

936
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:19,160
Krystal, you can drop the act.
This isn't a real cop.

937
00:57:19,266 --> 00:57:21,734
Kevin wasn't assaulted.

938
00:57:21,835 --> 00:57:24,463
I just wanted to make Jim
look good for you guys.

939
00:57:24,571 --> 00:57:26,937
Like a real hero.
Kind of like me.

940
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,441
So, we hired a fake cop and we tied
up Kevin and put him in the closet.

941
00:57:30,544 --> 00:57:33,206
Jim was supposed to rescue him,
untie him, give him mouth-to-mouth.

942
00:57:33,313 --> 00:57:35,338
I don't know
what he likes to do.

943
00:57:35,449 --> 00:57:38,782
You know, and then Paul Finchhired an
exotic dancer instead of a real actor.

944
00:57:38,886 --> 00:57:41,013
Jim, is this true?

945
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:46,953
- Every word of it. - That is the stupidest
idea I have ever heard.

946
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:50,188
You've embarrassed me and Harold
and Mr. Belvedere.

947
00:57:50,297 --> 00:57:54,131
It's all my fault.
I'm a bad person.

948
00:57:54,234 --> 00:57:59,729
Oh, you're not a bad person. You were
just trying to help out your best friend.

949
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,799
And it was an awful idea. But I suppose
it's the thought that counts.

950
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:07,210
You know, actually, um...

951
00:58:07,314 --> 00:58:11,580
Actually, l-I never
should have allowed...

952
00:58:11,685 --> 00:58:15,553
such a... such a crazy plan
to happen in the first place.

953
00:58:15,656 --> 00:58:20,389
If you're gonna blame anybody here,
blame me.

954
00:58:20,494 --> 00:58:23,725
Well, I'm sorry, Jim. I didn't realize how
much pressure we put on you.

955
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:27,459
I'm sure you both learned your lesson
and I suppose I understand.

956
00:58:27,568 --> 00:58:31,368
Jim, if you put half as much energy into
your marriage as you put into tonight,

957
00:58:31,471 --> 00:58:33,735
I'm confident that I can give you
my blessing.

958
00:58:36,677 --> 00:58:39,578
And, Steven, we still adore you,
honey.

959
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,446
In fact, I think I know
who should hold onto this.

960
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:46,246
We adore you.
You'll take good care of it.

961
00:58:46,353 --> 00:58:49,117
You've gotta be kidding me.
No.

962
00:58:49,222 --> 00:58:51,816
Look it, Jim. Kevin. Boy, this really makes
me important to the wedding, huh?

963
00:58:53,544 --> 00:58:55,978
Yes.

964
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:00,072
Well, Mr. Belvedere, it's gonna
be one fucked-up wedding.

965
00:59:00,183 --> 00:59:02,242
Absolutely.

966
00:59:03,487 --> 00:59:05,717
Drive carefully.
There's more bags in the study.

967
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:07,983
Thank you.
You're welcome.

968
00:59:12,963 --> 00:59:14,897
Ow! Is there any room
for me?

969
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:17,262
Uh, nope.

970
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:19,631
Oh, I'll just drive up north
all by myself.

971
00:59:19,736 --> 00:59:21,897
That sounds good.
We'll see you later.

972
00:59:22,005 --> 00:59:25,736
No, I'll drive with you.
Oh, thanks, Cadence.

973
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:29,039
- Beautiful lady.
- Sure.

974
00:59:31,815 --> 00:59:34,648
Hey, Finch... I know, shut up.
Kevin.

975
00:59:45,062 --> 00:59:48,759
So, my mom found the dogs playing with
something unusual this morning.

976
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:52,801
What?
I told her it was a neck massager.

977
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:56,905
Oh, these are great.

978
01:00:20,981 --> 01:00:24,974
Hilarious, huh?
Yeah.

979
01:00:25,085 --> 01:00:27,576
That kind of thing's
so lethargic to me.

980
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:30,417
What do you mean?

981
01:00:30,524 --> 01:00:32,253
I'm not sure.

982
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:54,147
Mr. "Stifler,"
I already told you...

983
01:00:54,247 --> 01:00:56,875
you called two days ago
and cancelled your reservation.

984
01:00:56,983 --> 01:00:58,951
Since you now
wish to stay here,

985
01:00:59,052 --> 01:01:01,543
I thought you could persuade
Mr. Finch to share his room.

986
01:01:01,655 --> 01:01:04,488
Hey, shithead.
I didn't cancel my reservation.

987
01:01:04,591 --> 01:01:06,582
Mr. Fuckface Finch
called here,

988
01:01:06,693 --> 01:01:08,957
and Mr. Idiot-Behind-The-Desk
cancelled it.

989
01:01:09,062 --> 01:01:13,658
Kristof, please pardon my friend's
uncouth behaviour.

990
01:01:13,767 --> 01:01:15,496
I did no such thing.

991
01:01:15,602 --> 01:01:17,467
Nor did I, sir,

992
01:01:17,571 --> 01:01:21,507
and your rudeness and obscenities
won't change anything.

993
01:01:21,608 --> 01:01:24,133
Oh. Well, then,
I guess it doesn't matter...

994
01:01:24,244 --> 01:01:27,111
if I call you a crotch-face,
you ball-scratching Finch-fucker.

995
01:01:27,214 --> 01:01:29,239
- Or better yet, go blow your dad!
- My dad?

996
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:30,976
Hear, hear!

997
01:01:31,084 --> 01:01:33,746
While you're there, stick a finger up
both their asses.

998
01:01:33,854 --> 01:01:34,821
Oh.

999
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:36,821
Um, uh, hey.
Hi.

1000
01:01:36,923 --> 01:01:39,585
Um, Finch, rudeness and obscenity
won't change anything.

1001
01:01:39,693 --> 01:01:43,060
Here's a thought. Grow a sack,
fill it with some balls,

1002
01:01:43,163 --> 01:01:47,600
magically sprout a dick, shove it up
your ass, start fucking yourself with it.

1003
01:01:47,701 --> 01:01:49,134
Yeah, baby!

1004
01:01:49,236 --> 01:01:51,204
Whoo! Baby, you know
what I'm sayin'? Oh!

1005
01:01:51,304 --> 01:01:52,862
Ohh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1006
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:54,600
Yeah!
This is disgusting!

1007
01:01:54,708 --> 01:01:58,667
- Why don't you go dust with your
perverse European cousin?

1008
01:01:58,778 --> 01:02:02,509
Is she here?
Unbelievable.

1009
01:02:02,616 --> 01:02:05,346
I'd like to book a tee time
for my husband...

1010
01:02:05,452 --> 01:02:07,647
and a European pumpkin-peel facial
for me, please.

1011
01:02:07,754 --> 01:02:09,722
Ooh!
Make that two.

1012
01:02:09,823 --> 01:02:12,053
You're gonna have
a fun weekend, Ma.

1013
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:15,026
I am missing my soap.
Well, don't you worry about your soaps.

1014
01:02:15,128 --> 01:02:18,063
Will you push faster?
I'm tired.

1015
01:02:18,165 --> 01:02:21,828
And wait till you meet Michelle.
You're gonna love her. She's sweet as sugar.

1016
01:02:21,935 --> 01:02:25,735
I can't eat sugar.
I know, because you're diabetic.

1017
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:30,640
You know, Ma, I know things haven't
been going well for you. I know that.

1018
01:02:30,744 --> 01:02:33,406
But wait till you see Jim standing
up there at the altar tomorrow.

1019
01:02:33,513 --> 01:02:38,177
I mean, if ever there was a time to be
happy and smile the biggest smile,

1020
01:02:38,285 --> 01:02:41,584
now is the time.
Okay. Okay!

1021
01:02:41,688 --> 01:02:44,213
I'm overjoyed.

1022
01:02:44,324 --> 01:02:47,816
That's... That's a start.

1023
01:02:47,928 --> 01:02:51,091
Proud grandmother
coming through.

1024
01:02:51,198 --> 01:02:53,189
Grandsons getting married tomorrow.

1025
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,167
You think she's happy now?
Wait till tomorrow.

1026
01:02:57,537 --> 01:03:00,165
Congratulations.

1027
01:03:06,613 --> 01:03:09,013
Grooming.

1028
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:56,773
The flowers stay refrigerated
until morning.

1029
01:03:56,879 --> 01:03:59,507
Just as we made them.
Oh, I'm sure they will.

1030
01:03:59,615 --> 01:04:01,947
Oh, my...

1031
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:15,326
- Oh! Ah!
- Oh, Jimmy, no!

1032
01:04:15,431 --> 01:04:17,558
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1033
01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:28,075
I hope you'll be more careful
with the next one.

1034
01:04:28,177 --> 01:04:30,975
My kitchen is not a toilet.
Okay?

1035
01:04:38,187 --> 01:04:41,714
Boy, pubic hair was just not an issue
when I was dating.

1036
01:04:43,225 --> 01:04:46,888
The ladies, uh, never complained
when they were...

1037
01:04:46,996 --> 01:04:48,896
you know, down in that general area.

1038
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:51,364
Okay, if you never mention that
ever again, that'd be great.

1039
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:54,994
You're right. No, no, no. Okay.
Shouldn't have brought it up. Maybe...

1040
01:04:55,104 --> 01:04:55,204
So, can I see the ring?

1041
01:04:55,204 --> 01:04:57,001
So, can I see the ring?

1042
01:04:57,106 --> 01:05:01,600
Nope. Promised to keep it safe.
It's not leaving my pocket.

1043
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:03,974
Okay, Frodo.

1044
01:05:06,081 --> 01:05:08,948
You really care about
this wedding, don't you?

1045
01:05:09,051 --> 01:05:13,181
Yeah. I'm gonna cry
at the ceremony.

1046
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:16,189
I know it.

1047
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,384
Are you just saying
all of this?

1048
01:05:18,494 --> 01:05:24,194
I mean, do you act differently
around certain people? Namely me.

1049
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:28,258
Of course not. Why? Do you act
differently around me?

1050
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:32,807
Generally I'm just me. If people don't
like it, then that's their problem, right?

1051
01:05:32,908 --> 01:05:34,933
Yeah. Fuck those fuckers.

1052
01:05:35,044 --> 01:05:36,944
What?

1053
01:05:37,046 --> 01:05:40,573
L-I didn't... No, you know, you're right.
Fuck 'em.

1054
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:49,780
- Hey, Harold and Mary.
- Oh, hi, kids. - Hi.

1055
01:05:49,892 --> 01:05:51,917
How's it going?

1056
01:05:52,027 --> 01:05:55,155
Thanks for, um... Come on.
Thanks for watching the dogs.

1057
01:05:55,264 --> 01:05:59,928
I love these guys. Hey, you guys want
more Snausages? Huh? There you go.

1058
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:02,594
- Eat 'em up, fellas.
- Give me some.

1059
01:06:02,704 --> 01:06:05,605
Oh, there you go.
I don't think I have any left.

1060
01:06:08,243 --> 01:06:11,303
- What's wrong?
- Oh, shit.

1061
01:06:11,413 --> 01:06:14,314
- Are you okay?

1062
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:17,851
Yeah.

1063
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:23,625
You kissed Stifler?
Yeah, but then he freaked.

1064
01:06:23,725 --> 01:06:26,489
And it's like he's been paying more
attention to the dogs than me.

1065
01:06:26,595 --> 01:06:30,588
Can I stop worrying then? Michelle,
he's been nothing but nice to me.

1066
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:33,793
I mean, do you think
he really likes you? Like...

1067
01:06:33,902 --> 01:06:36,564
I don't know.
I hope he likes me.

1068
01:06:36,672 --> 01:06:39,106
I mean, I think
he likes me.

1069
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:43,144
We're... Well, yeah, I guess
I hope he likes me.

1070
01:06:46,181 --> 01:06:48,411
Do it.

1071
01:06:48,517 --> 01:06:50,417
Don't fuck around.

1072
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:53,181
Just relax and let it go.

1073
01:06:53,288 --> 01:06:55,188
I'm sick of waiting.

1074
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:57,690
Do it for Daddy.

1075
01:06:57,793 --> 01:07:00,660
Will you just take a shit already?

1076
01:07:04,182 --> 01:07:04,978
Great.

1077
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:07,313
You fed the ring to the dogs,
didn't you?

1078
01:07:07,419 --> 01:07:13,255
Of course not.

1079
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:16,452
You have been staring at those dogs
like a hawk all day.

1080
01:07:16,561 --> 01:07:18,995
I'm a dog lover.

1081
01:07:19,097 --> 01:07:21,429
Oh, and by the way...

1082
01:07:21,533 --> 01:07:25,299
apparently you missed
when Cadence kissed me.

1083
01:07:25,403 --> 01:07:27,530
Slight tongue action too.

1084
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:30,665
It was something like this.

1085
01:07:30,775 --> 01:07:32,538
You're a terrible liar, Stifler.

1086
01:07:32,644 --> 01:07:36,102
If I were lying, I'd think of something
better than a kiss.

1087
01:07:36,214 --> 01:07:39,047
Maybe a blow job
or some titty grabbin'.

1088
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:41,016
No pussy for you, Finch.

1089
01:07:42,554 --> 01:07:44,749
Oh, fuckin' right, doggy!

1090
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:48,576
It's about goddamn time.
Jackpot.!

1091
01:07:48,676 --> 01:07:53,409
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some shit to attend to.

1092
01:07:59,153 --> 01:08:01,713
Great!

1093
01:08:12,567 --> 01:08:13,625
Thanks, assholes.

1094
01:08:15,052 --> 01:08:17,748
You know, maybe you can call them.
Oh, okay.

1095
01:08:17,855 --> 01:08:21,848
Steve, come over here.

1096
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,861
Uh, I'm a little busy.

1097
01:08:25,963 --> 01:08:28,295
With what? Come on over.
We need you.

1098
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:32,028
Get over here, you little rascal. We were
just talking about Michelle's wedding band.

1099
01:08:32,136 --> 01:08:34,036
Could I see it?

1100
01:08:34,138 --> 01:08:36,732
Um, no.

1101
01:08:36,841 --> 01:08:40,174
- No?
- I don't have it.

1102
01:08:40,277 --> 01:08:43,474
What? You mean you lost it?
Of course not.

1103
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:46,379
I'm keeping it safe in my room,
you silly Sally.

1104
01:08:46,484 --> 01:08:49,180
- I apologize.
- That's fine. I'll just see it later.

1105
01:08:49,286 --> 01:08:52,016
Okay. All right then. What do you have
in your hand there?

1106
01:08:55,826 --> 01:08:59,887
- This one?
- No, the other one.

1107
01:09:01,832 --> 01:09:04,528
It's a chocolate truffle.
Ooh, yummy.!

1108
01:09:04,635 --> 01:09:06,728
Where did you get that?

1109
01:09:06,837 --> 01:09:11,672
Oh, the caterer said she was saving
the truffles for tomorrow.

1110
01:09:11,776 --> 01:09:13,676
You sneaky devil.

1111
01:09:15,746 --> 01:09:18,510
Well, hey, I managed
to sneak one right past her.

1112
01:09:18,616 --> 01:09:20,880
Oh, come on.
This woman loves chocolate.

1113
01:09:20,985 --> 01:09:23,419
- At least give her a tiny nibble.
- Give it to Mama.

1114
01:09:23,521 --> 01:09:26,786
Mama don't want this.
This is the only piece that I have.

1115
01:09:26,891 --> 01:09:29,689
- Idiot.
- Well, break it in half. Come on.

1116
01:09:29,794 --> 01:09:32,854
You know what? Let's just leave
the surprises till tomorrow, huh, guys?

1117
01:09:32,963 --> 01:09:35,761
- It's gonna be a great day.
- I'd like my surprise right now.

1118
01:09:35,866 --> 01:09:38,892
- No, it's mine!
- Steven, give it to me.

1119
01:09:39,003 --> 01:09:41,631
- No.
- Give me the "G" darn truffle.

1120
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:45,838
Steven, that is so selfish.

1121
01:09:47,178 --> 01:09:50,636
Mm, it's good.
Is it? Is it sweet?

1122
01:09:51,783 --> 01:09:56,186
- It's so sweet.

1123
01:09:56,287 --> 01:10:00,121
Close your mouth when you chew, Steven.
Don't do that.

1124
01:10:00,225 --> 01:10:05,060
At least you could describe to the
lovely woman how delicious it is.

1125
01:10:05,163 --> 01:10:08,929
Well, tastes like twigs
and berries.

1126
01:10:09,033 --> 01:10:11,160
Is it Swiss or French
chocolate?

1127
01:10:11,269 --> 01:10:13,430
Maybe German.
Oh, really?

1128
01:10:13,538 --> 01:10:16,564
Uh-huh.
Is it creamy?

1129
01:10:16,674 --> 01:10:19,199
Yeah, it's creamy.
Easy to go down, right?

1130
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,778
Well, I'm trying to savor the flavor
right now.

1131
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,542
Is it fresh?
- Oh, it's so fresh.

1132
01:10:24,649 --> 01:10:27,777
Nothing better than when they're fresh.
Nothing better.

1133
01:10:27,886 --> 01:10:30,411
The problem is you can't
eat just one, can ya?

1134
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:34,356
No. No, you can't. But you've got
to know when to stop, don't you?

1135
01:10:34,459 --> 01:10:36,859
You really do, but it's hard.
It's really hard.

1136
01:10:36,961 --> 01:10:39,794
Droppings from the gods.
Ooh!

1137
01:10:39,898 --> 01:10:41,798
Get me another one, darling.
Come on.

1138
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:44,391
You selfish boy. Next time, bring
enough for everybody.

1139
01:10:44,502 --> 01:10:47,164
Hey, let's keep this
to ourselves. Huh? Okay?

1140
01:10:47,272 --> 01:10:50,002
Okay.
I gotta go, okay?

1141
01:10:50,108 --> 01:10:52,906
Don't have any more because it's gonna
spoil your appetite.

1142
01:10:53,011 --> 01:10:55,639
Okay. Hey, look, man.
I gotta go.

1143
01:10:55,747 --> 01:10:57,078
See ya.

1144
01:11:02,487 --> 01:11:05,752
Grandma, I want you
to meet some people.

1145
01:11:08,026 --> 01:11:09,994
Grandma, this is Michelle.

1146
01:11:10,094 --> 01:11:11,561
I'm so proud to be joining your family.

1147
01:11:13,281 --> 01:11:14,748
She's real pretty, huh?

1148
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:19,419
Isn't it great?
We're getting married.

1149
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,511
It's amazing, Gram.

1150
01:11:23,824 --> 01:11:28,261
Not Jewish. No wedding, Jimmy!
No wedding.

1151
01:11:28,362 --> 01:11:30,922
Forget it. Goy.!
Grandma?

1152
01:11:31,032 --> 01:11:33,057
- Shit.
- Jim, she hates me.

1153
01:11:35,169 --> 01:11:36,966
Oh, my God!
Grandma!

1154
01:11:37,071 --> 01:11:39,096
Grandma, we love each other.

1155
01:11:39,206 --> 01:11:41,231
Michelle and I love each other
very much.

1156
01:11:41,342 --> 01:11:44,038
And that's all that matters.
Grandma.! Grandma.

1157
01:11:45,579 --> 01:11:48,571
Michelle. Michelle.

1158
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:51,750
But, uh, Grandma's okay.

1159
01:11:51,852 --> 01:11:55,720
Oh, she's okay. Oh, yeah, yeah, Dad.
She's okay. She's just a little tired.

1160
01:11:55,823 --> 01:11:58,656
Okay. My mother
hasn't been well.

1161
01:11:58,759 --> 01:12:01,319
When your dad sees the look
on Grandma's face...

1162
01:12:01,429 --> 01:12:04,421
it's... it's gonna
break his heart.

1163
01:12:04,532 --> 01:12:07,365
Because of me.
It's not because of you.

1164
01:12:07,468 --> 01:12:09,436
Michelle, it's not because
of you at all.

1165
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:12,404
It's because Grandma thinks
it's 1801.

1166
01:12:12,506 --> 01:12:16,442
Look. Don't... Don't worry.
I will... I'll come up with something.

1167
01:12:17,545 --> 01:12:19,638
I promised you
the wedding of your dreams,

1168
01:12:19,747 --> 01:12:22,773
and I'm not gonna let
anything ruin it.

1169
01:12:22,883 --> 01:12:24,976
Oh.

1170
01:12:25,086 --> 01:12:27,020
I would like to propose a toast.

1171
01:12:27,121 --> 01:12:31,421
These last few weeks have really been
something for my lovely wife and me.

1172
01:12:31,525 --> 01:12:34,619
We have met some people
we didn't know existed.

1173
01:12:34,728 --> 01:12:38,289
We've experienced some things
we didn't think were possible.

1174
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:41,425
We've always tried to make
the best of every situation.

1175
01:12:41,535 --> 01:12:44,333
- This is a good situation.
- That's what I'm saying.

1176
01:12:44,438 --> 01:12:46,838
This is a wonderful situation.

1177
01:12:46,941 --> 01:12:50,536
The coming together of two families
from different backgrounds.

1178
01:12:50,644 --> 01:12:54,045
So, to our new son-in-law,
may we say Erin Go Braugh.

1179
01:12:54,148 --> 01:12:57,515
To our lovely daughter
Michelle, L'chaim.

1180
01:12:57,618 --> 01:12:59,813
- Did I get that right?
- Very good.

1181
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,822
Uh, and let's hope we can sip
many happy shivas together.

1182
01:13:05,326 --> 01:13:07,157
Here's to a wonderful wedding.

1183
01:13:07,261 --> 01:13:09,525
Cheers.

1184
01:13:14,435 --> 01:13:18,201
See that, shit-brick.
Told you I won.

1185
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,708
Hey.
Hey.

1186
01:13:21,809 --> 01:13:26,837
So, I just wanted to say I'm sorry if
I freaked you out with the whole kiss thing.

1187
01:13:26,947 --> 01:13:28,847
You didn't freak me out.

1188
01:13:28,949 --> 01:13:32,441
I just wanted
to let you know that...

1189
01:13:32,553 --> 01:13:34,680
you make me feel special.

1190
01:13:35,789 --> 01:13:38,019
I think you're the most
special girl I've ever known.

1191
01:13:40,194 --> 01:13:43,823
Maybe you'd wanna make things
extra special tonight.

1192
01:13:43,931 --> 01:13:46,365
Which room is yours?

1193
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:48,935
I'm crashing at Kevin's.

1194
01:13:49,036 --> 01:13:51,596
Damn.
But I saw...

1195
01:13:51,705 --> 01:13:55,869
like a big, fluffy linen closet
at the end of the main hallway.

1196
01:13:55,976 --> 01:13:58,308
Yes. Big, fluffy linen closet is good.
Okay.

1197
01:13:58,412 --> 01:14:00,880
Midnight? All right.
Yeah. Okay.

1198
01:14:00,981 --> 01:14:03,108
Oh!

1199
01:14:04,852 --> 01:14:07,047
Gonna have sex with Cadence

1200
01:14:07,154 --> 01:14:10,214
Gonna have sex with Cadence

1201
01:14:10,324 --> 01:14:12,451
Whoo! Uh-huh.

1202
01:14:14,361 --> 01:14:16,352
Cadence
Jesus!

1203
01:14:16,463 --> 01:14:18,795
You fuckin' stalker.

1204
01:14:18,899 --> 01:14:21,129
You're nota very stealthy thief.

1205
01:14:21,235 --> 01:14:23,795
Oh, really?
Guess what, shit-brick, it's a wedding.

1206
01:14:23,904 --> 01:14:27,271
Everything's free.
What do you want?

1207
01:14:28,475 --> 01:14:31,740
Well, Stifler, Jim's grandma
doesn't approve of the wedding.

1208
01:14:31,845 --> 01:14:35,144
We're trying to run
interference and,

1209
01:14:35,249 --> 01:14:38,013
reluctantly, I am asking for your help.

1210
01:14:38,118 --> 01:14:42,646
Hmm. Sorry, Finch-meister.
I got plans with Cadence.

1211
01:14:42,756 --> 01:14:47,250
Stifler, maybe you could forget about your
dick for one second and actually be useful.

1212
01:14:47,361 --> 01:14:49,989
Fuck you, Finch.

1213
01:14:50,097 --> 01:14:52,497
You didn't eat shit, okay?

1214
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,262
You didn't prance around here
like a ballerina for the whole week.

1215
01:14:55,369 --> 01:14:57,496
"Oh, wedding" this.
"Suck my ass" that.

1216
01:14:57,605 --> 01:15:01,132
"I'm special. You're special." We're all
just a bunch of special fuckers, aren't we?

1217
01:15:01,242 --> 01:15:04,336
Well, you know what?
I'm a-gonna get laid, Finch-fucker.

1218
01:15:04,445 --> 01:15:06,470
And it's gonna be
oh, so good.

1219
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,480
It's gonna be like,
"You like this shit, Mama?"

1220
01:15:08,582 --> 01:15:10,812
She's gonna be like,
"Fuckin' right, doggy, give it to me.

1221
01:15:10,918 --> 01:15:13,512
Suck on my nipples
like you're milking a cow."

1222
01:15:13,621 --> 01:15:15,589
Like...

1223
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:27,364
You been here long?

1224
01:15:29,403 --> 01:15:31,496
Oh, shit.

1225
01:15:33,974 --> 01:15:36,807
Yeah.
Cadence,

1226
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:38,969
it is my distinct pleasure
to introduce you...

1227
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:43,516
- to the real Steve Stifler.
- Hi.

1228
01:15:43,617 --> 01:15:45,346
Hi.

1229
01:15:47,388 --> 01:15:50,687
Pumpkin.

1230
01:15:53,661 --> 01:15:56,027
You are quite the gentleman, Stifler.

1231
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:57,961
You could have told me
she was behind me.

1232
01:15:58,232 --> 01:16:02,191
Between Grandma and Stifler and Cadence.
The cake. The cake!

1233
01:16:02,303 --> 01:16:07,206
I mean, are you kidding me? You know,
I thought I had grown out of this...

1234
01:16:07,308 --> 01:16:11,074
sort of behaviour, but I keep messing up.

1235
01:16:11,178 --> 01:16:13,078
These things keep happening to me.

1236
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,614
And if I can't bring it
together for one day,

1237
01:16:15,716 --> 01:16:18,514
how am I gonna hold it together
for the rest of our lives?

1238
01:16:18,619 --> 01:16:20,849
I'm really afraid that this is
how it's always gonna be.

1239
01:16:20,954 --> 01:16:23,923
Yeah, but you always manage
to get yourself into serious shit,

1240
01:16:24,024 --> 01:16:27,687
and somehow you always come out
of it better than you went in.

1241
01:16:27,795 --> 01:16:30,923
I don't know how, but you do.
Everything is gonna be fine.

1242
01:16:31,031 --> 01:16:35,991
Yeah. Um, uh, you need to
come into the kitchen right now.

1243
01:16:36,103 --> 01:16:39,334
There's... Yeah.
Jesus, now what?

1244
01:16:45,045 --> 01:16:48,173
There is no way to remake
all these in time, is there?

1245
01:16:48,282 --> 01:16:50,512
Something must have
disrupted the power.

1246
01:16:50,617 --> 01:16:54,018
The compressors need time to reset
after a power loss, or they overheat.

1247
01:16:54,121 --> 01:16:57,113
Essentially, it turns the refrigerator
into an oven.

1248
01:16:57,224 --> 01:17:01,593
Stifler was in here earlier
flipping switches.

1249
01:17:01,695 --> 01:17:03,856
Michelle, I am so sorry.

1250
01:17:05,699 --> 01:17:08,566
Hey!

1251
01:17:12,072 --> 01:17:13,972
Ooh. Those flowers
look hideous.

1252
01:17:14,074 --> 01:17:15,974
That's 'cause you killed them,
Stifler.

1253
01:17:16,076 --> 01:17:18,840
You've ruined everything.

1254
01:17:18,946 --> 01:17:22,245
F... What are you
talking about?

1255
01:17:22,349 --> 01:17:25,807
You obviously don't care about this
wedding or anyone in it.

1256
01:17:28,021 --> 01:17:31,218
Cadence.

1257
01:17:33,127 --> 01:17:35,823
Jim?

1258
01:17:37,297 --> 01:17:39,731
Shit-brick, come on.

1259
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:47,805
Maybe you should
just leave, Stifler.

1260
01:17:52,346 --> 01:17:55,179
Fine. Adios.

1261
01:19:02,249 --> 01:19:05,514
Fuckers, it's not my fault!

1262
01:19:05,619 --> 01:19:08,349
I'm not an "intellectual Einstein".
I'm not...

1263
01:19:10,123 --> 01:19:12,956
- Damn it.!

1264
01:19:16,497 --> 01:19:18,761
Fuck!

1265
01:19:27,407 --> 01:19:30,001
Hey, flower fuckers, you there?

1266
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:32,908
Zyskowski.

1267
01:19:43,457 --> 01:19:45,687
Hello?

1268
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:48,955
Are you awake?

1269
01:19:49,062 --> 01:19:53,192
Come on. Come on.
Anybody awake?

1270
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,564
Oh.!

1271
01:19:55,669 --> 01:19:58,297
- Are you Miss Zyskowski?
- Who are you?

1272
01:19:58,405 --> 01:20:02,239
I'm the guy who just killed all the flowers
for the Levenstein-band geek wedding.

1273
01:20:02,342 --> 01:20:05,311
- What?
- Yeah, I'm that guy.

1274
01:20:05,412 --> 01:20:09,576
Now what I need you to do is drag
your ass down to your little store,

1275
01:20:09,683 --> 01:20:11,617
gather up some flowers,
slice 'em and dice 'em,

1276
01:20:11,718 --> 01:20:15,381
jam 'em all together and cart that crap
down to the wedding.

1277
01:20:15,489 --> 01:20:17,616
Are you completely insane?

1278
01:20:17,724 --> 01:20:21,057
- You have no idea.
- Even if I overlook the fact...

1279
01:20:21,161 --> 01:20:23,823
that this is the rudest thing
I have ever encountered,

1280
01:20:23,931 --> 01:20:26,661
there is no time
to redo all that work.

1281
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:29,964
I had four assistants working two
full days on that wedding.

1282
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:31,970
I'm sorry.

1283
01:20:32,072 --> 01:20:34,302
It's impossible.

1284
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,939
We don't quit at halftime, ma'am!

1285
01:20:42,049 --> 01:20:45,075
You don't score
until you score!

1286
01:20:50,123 --> 01:20:52,148
That's the spirit, sweetheart.

1287
01:21:02,469 --> 01:21:05,097
Pick up the pace.

1288
01:21:05,205 --> 01:21:08,231
You guys keep working this hard,
we'll be able to beat the Wildcats.

1289
01:21:08,342 --> 01:21:10,970
You remember how tough
they were last year.

1290
01:21:11,078 --> 01:21:13,273
Come on. Let's see
some determination.

1291
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:15,814
Determination.!

1292
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:23,116
Come on. Keep working.!

1293
01:21:27,294 --> 01:21:29,888
Good, Connor. Very good.
Good, DeBoer.

1294
01:21:29,997 --> 01:21:31,965
Really sucks.
Go fix it.

1295
01:21:32,065 --> 01:21:35,967
Hey, party guy. Having a good time,
huh? Can I get you a gin and tonic?

1296
01:21:36,069 --> 01:21:39,561
Ring! Hold on a second.
Hello. Okay.

1297
01:21:39,673 --> 01:21:41,800
It's for you.
It's "get to work, fucker."

1298
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:46,136
We are gathered here today
to join these two great people...

1299
01:21:46,246 --> 01:21:49,613
in a blessed union and bladdah,
bladdah, bladdah and crap.

1300
01:21:49,716 --> 01:21:52,344
Coach, this is kinda gay.

1301
01:21:53,887 --> 01:21:56,583
Yeah, it is.

1302
01:21:57,891 --> 01:22:01,554
Good work.
Hey, no problem.

1303
01:22:01,662 --> 01:22:03,562
So, you got a date
for this thing?

1304
01:22:03,664 --> 01:22:05,564
Don't push it.
Sorry.

1305
01:22:10,737 --> 01:22:12,705
Holy shit.

1306
01:22:12,806 --> 01:22:14,899
How the hell did this happen?

1307
01:22:15,008 --> 01:22:17,033
It's a miracle.

1308
01:22:17,144 --> 01:22:19,112
Stifler. Save it, dickhead.
I'm working.

1309
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:33,889
- You're an asshole.
- I know.

1310
01:22:33,994 --> 01:22:36,121
You really are an asshole.

1311
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:39,892
Thanks.

1312
01:22:41,334 --> 01:22:43,734
I don't do apologies so good.

1313
01:22:45,038 --> 01:22:47,598
Well, you get an "A" for effort.
This is amazing.

1314
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:49,835
Cool.

1315
01:22:49,943 --> 01:22:52,605
I was always kind of
a "C" student.

1316
01:22:52,713 --> 01:22:55,238
So, did you do all this
just to have sex with me...

1317
01:22:55,348 --> 01:22:57,612
or because you really care
about the wedding?

1318
01:22:57,718 --> 01:22:59,879
Both.

1319
01:23:01,354 --> 01:23:04,152
And, uh...

1320
01:23:04,257 --> 01:23:06,157
I like you.

1321
01:23:06,259 --> 01:23:07,920
What?

1322
01:23:09,663 --> 01:23:11,563
I like you.

1323
01:23:11,665 --> 01:23:14,133
Well, that's an honest answer.

1324
01:23:14,234 --> 01:23:16,168
I gotta go.

1325
01:23:21,908 --> 01:23:25,639
Steve Stifler just gave
a rose to a girl and meant it.

1326
01:23:25,746 --> 01:23:31,582
This is huge. It's... It's like watching
monkeys use tools for the first time.

1327
01:23:31,685 --> 01:23:31,785
You still pissed
about me and Cadence?

1328
01:23:31,785 --> 01:23:33,685
You still pissed
about me and Cadence?

1329
01:23:33,787 --> 01:23:35,687
No. Let's see.

1330
01:23:35,789 --> 01:23:38,053
She wasn't into the heavy intellectual
stuff.

1331
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:40,854
She actually liked me
being that imbecile.

1332
01:23:40,961 --> 01:23:45,057
No, no, somehow I think
she's probably better off with you.

1333
01:23:45,165 --> 01:23:47,133
Thanks, shit-brick.

1334
01:23:49,102 --> 01:23:54,199
Ooh. Dick.
Fucking hate not hating you.

1335
01:23:58,345 --> 01:24:00,813
I did fuck your mom.

1336
01:24:02,315 --> 01:24:04,215
Twice.

1337
01:24:04,317 --> 01:24:08,276
Ooh! That's better, fucker!

1338
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:13,292
Oh. Whoa!
Ready to go?

1339
01:24:13,393 --> 01:24:16,055
Um, the wedding's
not for another hour.

1340
01:24:16,163 --> 01:24:18,188
No, I mean you and me.

1341
01:24:18,298 --> 01:24:20,323
Hold on. Hold on.

1342
01:24:20,433 --> 01:24:22,526
Do I still gotta do
this bullshit meeting?

1343
01:24:22,636 --> 01:24:24,729
Stifler, you are not
bailing on Jim.

1344
01:24:24,838 --> 01:24:27,568
Shit!
Give me 10 minutes?

1345
01:24:31,511 --> 01:24:34,844
I'll meet you at the closet.
The closet.

1346
01:24:41,688 --> 01:24:44,054
You wanted to see me,
Michelle?

1347
01:24:44,157 --> 01:24:46,591
Oh! Okay, sit.

1348
01:24:49,029 --> 01:24:52,658
So, uh, Jim said that you've always
kind of been there for him...

1349
01:24:52,766 --> 01:24:55,894
when he needed you, so I thought
maybe you could help me.

1350
01:24:56,002 --> 01:24:58,368
Jim said that?

1351
01:25:01,842 --> 01:25:03,833
What's, uh...
What's the problem?

1352
01:25:03,944 --> 01:25:07,903
Okay. Well, I, uh...

1353
01:25:08,014 --> 01:25:09,948
I still can't get
my vows right.

1354
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:13,918
Oh. I haven't been this confused
since I got my first period.

1355
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:16,454
That's a very confusing time
for any young lady.

1356
01:25:16,556 --> 01:25:20,424
You know, your body
is going through, uh, changes.

1357
01:25:20,527 --> 01:25:24,759
Um, stuff coming out,
stuff going in.

1358
01:25:24,865 --> 01:25:28,961
Oh, no. I need help with my vows,
not my period.

1359
01:25:29,069 --> 01:25:31,230
Oh, your vows.
Your vows.

1360
01:25:31,338 --> 01:25:35,138
Yes, uh, good.
Um, go on.

1361
01:25:35,242 --> 01:25:37,802
Jim just wants a groomsmen's meeting
before the wedding.

1362
01:25:37,911 --> 01:25:42,746
It shouldn't take long.
Just don't let her talk to anyone.

1363
01:25:42,849 --> 01:25:45,113
Be careful.
She's feisty.

1364
01:25:48,889 --> 01:25:50,880
Okay, let's go.

1365
01:25:50,991 --> 01:25:53,619
Hey, guys. Thanks for coming out
here and meeting me.

1366
01:25:53,727 --> 01:25:56,753
I, um... I just have a couple of things
I wanna say.

1367
01:25:56,863 --> 01:25:59,798
This sucks.

1368
01:26:02,769 --> 01:26:04,703
Did I say that out loud?

1369
01:26:06,706 --> 01:26:09,971
Keep going.
It's good.

1370
01:26:10,076 --> 01:26:12,772
Now, I thought about
what you said, Kev.

1371
01:26:12,879 --> 01:26:17,043
About, uh, about how my problems
always seem to work out.

1372
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:21,587
And I realized that the reason
things always work out...

1373
01:26:21,688 --> 01:26:25,818
is because you guys have always
been there to back me up.

1374
01:26:25,926 --> 01:26:27,826
Even you, Stifler.

1375
01:26:30,897 --> 01:26:33,195
For the first time in my life...

1376
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:38,033
I actually feel like
I can't mess anything up.

1377
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,165
Which is pretty amazing.

1378
01:26:43,276 --> 01:26:45,540
So, uh,

1379
01:26:45,645 --> 01:26:49,877
l-I guess I just wanted
to say thank you.

1380
01:26:51,584 --> 01:26:55,145
Thanks. Yeah.
Thanks?

1381
01:26:55,255 --> 01:26:57,553
This whole thing
was about thanks?

1382
01:26:57,657 --> 01:26:59,955
Ooh! You're welcome,
cock-block!

1383
01:27:03,296 --> 01:27:05,730
That was good, Jim.
Real nice.

1384
01:27:05,832 --> 01:27:08,062
Let's get you married.
Hmm?

1385
01:27:08,168 --> 01:27:10,295
Okay.

1386
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:13,937
Love is very difficult
to describe.

1387
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,907
And I understand the angst.
I mean, it's your wedding.

1388
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:19,808
And it's natural.
It's perfectly natural.

1389
01:27:19,913 --> 01:27:22,905
But it's impossible
to describe a feeling.

1390
01:27:23,016 --> 01:27:26,213
Okay, first,
nothing is impossible.

1391
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:28,844
So, let's not focus
on that.

1392
01:27:28,955 --> 01:27:34,518
Why do you think, Michelle,
they call it "making love"?

1393
01:27:35,895 --> 01:27:38,659
I don't know.
I just call it "boneing."

1394
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,531
Boneing.

1395
01:27:42,635 --> 01:27:45,900
Well, when you're doing
other things with Jim...

1396
01:27:46,006 --> 01:27:48,531
when you're not,
um, boneing...

1397
01:27:48,641 --> 01:27:50,575
how does
he make you feel?

1398
01:27:52,145 --> 01:27:54,045
Horny, like I wanna bone.

1399
01:27:54,147 --> 01:27:57,014
But we can't be boneing
from sunrise to sunset, dear.

1400
01:27:57,117 --> 01:27:59,051
Oh, you've never tried it?

1401
01:27:59,152 --> 01:28:03,179
I certainly have.
I have. I've boned.

1402
01:28:03,289 --> 01:28:06,952
From sunrise right through brunch,
on more than one occasion.

1403
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:11,895
But boneing aside, um, I think they call it
"making love"...

1404
01:28:11,998 --> 01:28:15,297
because you have to
make love work.

1405
01:28:16,836 --> 01:28:19,703
You know,
it's about compromise and sacrifice.

1406
01:28:19,806 --> 01:28:22,104
And I think Jim
has sacrificed for you.

1407
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:24,438
My God, he shaved
his entire pubic region,

1408
01:28:24,544 --> 01:28:27,536
which would baffle most
cultures around the world.

1409
01:28:27,647 --> 01:28:32,584
But he did it,
and he did it for you.

1410
01:28:33,686 --> 01:28:37,850
You're right.
Love isn't just a feeling.

1411
01:28:37,957 --> 01:28:39,982
It's shaving your balls.

1412
01:28:41,094 --> 01:28:42,721
Thanks, Dad.

1413
01:28:43,897 --> 01:28:47,924
I wouldn't get into too much detail
on that.

1414
01:28:48,034 --> 01:28:50,229
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

1415
01:28:50,336 --> 01:28:52,236
Oh, yeah, excuse me.
Pardon me. Pardon me.

1416
01:28:52,338 --> 01:28:55,068
Gonna have sex with Cadence
Uh-huh.

1417
01:29:03,349 --> 01:29:07,718
You know, son, I think this is probably
the right time to tell you that...

1418
01:29:09,422 --> 01:29:13,859
that...
I know, Dad.

1419
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:26,639
I can't see anything here.

1420
01:29:29,909 --> 01:29:32,173
Oh, there you are.

1421
01:29:33,346 --> 01:29:37,009
Guys, what are you doing?
Where's Jim's grandma?

1422
01:29:37,117 --> 01:29:39,415
The old bitch sucked.
We had to ditch her.

1423
01:29:39,519 --> 01:29:41,578
You what?
Don't worry.

1424
01:29:41,688 --> 01:29:44,987
We put her someplace
no one will find her.

1425
01:29:45,091 --> 01:29:49,050
Cadence, where are you going?
Oh, Mom.

1426
01:29:50,263 --> 01:29:53,391
Oh, baby.
I'm so ready for this.

1427
01:29:56,069 --> 01:29:59,698
Your body's not quite what I was
expecting, but that's okay.

1428
01:29:59,806 --> 01:30:03,936
The Stif-man digs
what's underneath.

1429
01:30:04,043 --> 01:30:09,242
Oh, you are so beautiful.
Oh, I just wanna...

1430
01:30:11,618 --> 01:30:14,519
Stifler.! Granny.!

1431
01:30:14,621 --> 01:30:17,852
Granny? What?
Focus! Focus! Focus!

1432
01:30:17,957 --> 01:30:20,983
Out...
It's not what it looks like!

1433
01:30:21,094 --> 01:30:24,154
- Shut the fucking door!

1434
01:30:24,264 --> 01:30:27,358
You got it, champ.

1435
01:30:48,388 --> 01:30:51,084
You're a hero.

1436
01:30:52,192 --> 01:30:54,626
Hey, pussy's pussy.

1437
01:30:54,727 --> 01:30:59,027
Look at the smile
on my mother's face.

1438
01:30:59,132 --> 01:31:02,033
Do you know how long she's been
waiting for a day like this?

1439
01:31:02,135 --> 01:31:04,467
I can't imagine.

1440
01:31:10,443 --> 01:31:12,934
I couldn't be happier.
Thank you.

1441
01:31:15,548 --> 01:31:17,448
Don't.

1442
01:31:19,552 --> 01:31:22,282
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.

1443
01:31:27,393 --> 01:31:29,293
What made Grandma
come around?

1444
01:31:29,395 --> 01:31:31,522
Finch said Stifler
talked to her.

1445
01:31:31,631 --> 01:31:34,225
Stifler?

1446
01:31:36,336 --> 01:31:38,236
Grandmother fucker.

1447
01:31:38,338 --> 01:31:40,932
You're a motherfucker.

1448
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:45,340
Yes, I am.
Oh, you son of a bitch.

1449
01:31:45,445 --> 01:31:49,973
And I promise to love you
for as long as I shall live.

1450
01:31:50,083 --> 01:31:53,985
Michelle, you are the one woman
I want to be with...

1451
01:31:54,087 --> 01:31:56,783
and the woman
I can't be without.

1452
01:31:56,889 --> 01:31:58,857
I love you.

1453
01:31:58,958 --> 01:32:00,789
I love you.

1454
01:32:16,643 --> 01:32:18,543
Jim,

1455
01:32:18,645 --> 01:32:22,706
I had trouble finding the words
to tell you how I feel.

1456
01:32:22,815 --> 01:32:25,045
And I realized something.

1457
01:32:25,151 --> 01:32:28,177
Love isn't just a feeling.

1458
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:30,188
Love is something you do.

1459
01:32:31,658 --> 01:32:34,957
It's a dress,
a visit to band camp.

1460
01:32:35,061 --> 01:32:38,292
A special haircut.

1461
01:32:38,398 --> 01:32:41,299
Jim, you've given me
everything I've ever wanted.

1462
01:32:41,401 --> 01:32:43,892
And it is my solemn vow...

1463
01:32:44,003 --> 01:32:46,665
to give everything I am to you.

1464
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:03,284
James Emanuel Levenstein...

1465
01:33:03,389 --> 01:33:05,289
and Michelle Anabeth Flaherty,

1466
01:33:05,391 --> 01:33:08,383
I hereby pronounce you
husband and wife.

1467
01:33:08,494 --> 01:33:10,962
You may kiss the bride.

1468
01:33:28,948 --> 01:33:34,181
Let's all welcome Mr. And Mrs. Jim and
Michelle Levenstein onto the dance floor.

1469
01:33:34,287 --> 01:33:37,051
Just follow my lead.
I'll try.

1470
01:34:06,386 --> 01:34:08,479
I taught him that.

1471
01:34:09,589 --> 01:34:12,387
Jim, you learned to dance.

1472
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:58,002
Well, seems like everything worked out.
Magnificently.

1473
01:34:58,104 --> 01:35:02,973
I feel a bit sad that tonight our little
Michelle is going to be a woman.

1474
01:35:03,075 --> 01:35:06,738
Honey, you don't honestly believe
that Michelle is still a...

1475
01:35:06,846 --> 01:35:10,475
Well, I'll tell you, Mary. I can't recall a
single moment with either one of them...

1476
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:12,813
that would make me
think otherwise.

1477
01:35:12,919 --> 01:35:14,682
Thank you. See?

1478
01:35:14,787 --> 01:35:17,654
Whew! Whoa!

1479
01:35:24,831 --> 01:35:26,731
Hey, tough guy.

1480
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:29,165
Stifler's mom.

1481
01:35:30,670 --> 01:35:33,195
Well, we meet again.

1482
01:35:33,306 --> 01:35:36,139
I was curious.
Didn't see you here.

1483
01:35:36,242 --> 01:35:38,733
I try to keep a low profile.

1484
01:35:38,845 --> 01:35:41,643
I never really did
like these things anyway.

1485
01:35:41,747 --> 01:35:45,046
You know, this has actually
made quite an impression on me.

1486
01:35:45,151 --> 01:35:48,018
I have something to look for
in a woman now.

1487
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,384
Well, if this is your idea
of a proposal...

1488
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:53,653
Finchy, you gotta know
that I'm over you now.

1489
01:35:53,759 --> 01:35:56,193
And I'm over you.

1490
01:35:56,295 --> 01:35:59,822
But as they say,
we will always have Paris.

1491
01:35:59,932 --> 01:36:02,196
And the pool table.
And the car.

1492
01:36:02,301 --> 01:36:05,702
And the two-room suite
I have upstairs. Come here.

1493
01:36:11,377 --> 01:36:14,505
Turned out better
than I ever imagined.

1494
01:36:14,614 --> 01:36:18,345
How did a little perv like you
turn into such a great guy?

1495
01:36:18,451 --> 01:36:21,852
How did a little nympho like you
turn into such a great girl?

1496
01:36:21,954 --> 01:36:24,855
I'm still a nympho.
Oh, I'm still a perv.

1497
01:36:24,957 --> 01:36:29,257
I know.
What's wrong with us?

1498
01:36:46,562 --> 01:36:48,553
You know, Michelle,

1499
01:36:48,664 --> 01:36:52,100
to quote someone
I've learned quite a bit from,

1500
01:36:52,201 --> 01:36:54,601
"I think you and I...

1501
01:36:54,704 --> 01:36:58,834
are a perfectly natural,
normal thing."

1502
01:36:59,976 --> 01:37:02,308
Perfectly natural.

1503
01:37:20,496 --> 01:37:23,158
That's her.
Holy shit, dude.

1504
01:37:23,266 --> 01:37:25,427
I told you this wedding
would be worth it.

1505
01:37:25,535 --> 01:37:29,335
Oh, my goddess.
My queen. My MILF. Oh.

1506
01:37:29,438 --> 01:37:31,463
MILF. MILF.
MILF. MILF.

1507
01:37:31,574 --> 01:37:33,474
MILF. MILF.

1508
01:37:47,757 --> 01:37:50,248
No way, bro!

1509
01:37:50,359 --> 01:37:53,817
Hey, you're not finished yet,
are you, Finchy?

1510
01:37:53,930 --> 01:37:58,026
No, ma'am.
Just getting started.

1511
01:37:58,134 --> 01:38:00,625
This guy is the fucking master.

1512
01:38:02,638 --> 01:38:04,538
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Make it stop. Make it stop.

1513
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,870
Make it stop.

1514
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:09,912
Oh, Stifler's mom.

1515
01:38:09,912 --> 01:38:11,209
Oh, Stifler's mom.

1516
01:38:11,209 --> 01:38:21,209
