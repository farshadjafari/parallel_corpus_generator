Then, what it could kill with it's mouth,

9
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,798
it bit to death.

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,277
Eventually when the neighbors prepared to kill it,

11
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,713
it ran off.

he didn't have any strength.

But he stared at me like that for awhile
and then slowly laid down and died.

I buried that dog behind the neighborhood,
and the dog that was buried in the ground like that

19
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,276

these people here don't know that Joseon kid at all.
