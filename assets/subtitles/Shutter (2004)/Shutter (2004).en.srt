2
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:34,415
Cheers!

3
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,332
Excellent.

4
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,500
Let's drink until we drop.

5
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,375
Save something for your wife.

6
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,457
Are you kidding?

7
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:55,040
Alcohol revives me.

8
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:58,082
The later it gets, the hornier I get.

9
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:02,375
Another glass. A little sip.

10
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,500
Tell me, Jane...

11
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,125
What year are you in?

12
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,707
4th year.

13
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:12,875
A senior should know better.

14
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:16,040
What are you doing with Tun?

15
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,750
He's a hunk.

16
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:20,415
You keep saying that.

17
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:23,582
Making Jim ask for girl's numbers.

18
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,750
Then breaking their hearts.

19
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,415
Speaking of broken hearts...

20
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,915
Remember the time...

21
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:32,665
that girl left him a drunken mess.

22
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,832
Her name was Kay.

23
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:38,040
Ignore them.

24
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:40,832
Wait. I have a question.

25
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:43,082
How can a guy like you get married?

26
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,832
What's wrong with me?

27
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,250
After a long tiring day...

28
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:50,415
I want to head home...

29
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,165
to a wife's embrace or a pet's face.

30
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:55,207
Not waste my life...

31
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,332
partying with you losers.

32
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,750
Not with me.

33
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,750
A good man...

34
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,833
who went whoring with me last night.

35
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,790
Fooling around so soon?

36
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:10,708
Here she comes.

37
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,208
Quiet.

38
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,875
What's so funny?

39
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,040
Nothing.

40
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,915
One last thing...

41
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,290
One more glass!

42
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,332
What are we listening to?

43
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:48,832
Don't turn it off.

44
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,250
It's beautiful.

45
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,500
You guys seem tight.

46
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,957
Do you meet often?

47
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,915
What are you looking at?

48
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,875
Beautiful you.

49
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,375
What a sap.

50
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:52,500
Are you hurt?

51
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,750
Tun...

52
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:57,875
Is she dead?

53
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:08,333
Wait!

54
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:19,665
Drive away.

55
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,165
I said drive away!

56
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:25,332
Drive away!

57
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,665
Get closer, please.

58
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,290
Okay.

59
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:41,790
Big smile, Nuch.

60
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:44,165
Or you won't look pretty.

61
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:54,457
All Science Majors...

62
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,665
gather for a class photo.

63
00:07:57,457 --> 00:07:58,750
They're calling you.

64
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,790
Where's Jane?

65
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,958
Taking photos with her friends.

66
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,833
I thought maybe you broke up.

67
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,583
Come! Let's go.

68
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,582
I phoned but you didn't pick up.

69
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:12,375
Was it on silent?

70
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,666
Nuch asked about you today.

71
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,957
When will you be free?

72
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,957
She wants to...

73
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:54,040
Jane.

74
00:09:56,165 --> 00:09:58,750
How can you act like this?

75
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,291
Pretending nothing happened.

76
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,416
Since that night...

77
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:09,166
I haven't slept soundly.

78
00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:15,582
I'm upset as well.

79
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:20,166
At least we should have checked.

80
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,916
It was an accident.

81
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,957
That's easy for you to say.

82
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,041
You weren't behind the wheel...

83
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,582
Hi, Ti. / Hey.

84
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:46,957
How's business?

85
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,415
With you here this early...

86
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,832
business should be bad.

87
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,457
Are my prints ready?

88
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,415
Yeah. Just a sec.

89
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,082
Here.

90
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,291
Is your processor broken?

91
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:32,832
Let's see.

92
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:39,125
The nerve.

93
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,165
Nice prints and you're great.

94
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:43,665
If they suck it's my fault.

95
00:11:43,957 --> 00:11:46,040
Let's check the negative.

96
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,582
No way.

97
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,415
I took them. I should know.

98
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:50,665
We'll see.

99
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,125
See.

100
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,832
Your negatives are bad.

101
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:22,457
Tun.

102
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:34,165
Tun.

103
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:53,332
Tun.

104
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:57,290
Can you hear me?

105
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Help!

106
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,875
Help!

107
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:46,832
Don't be scared. I'm here now.

108
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:09,582
What's wrong with your camera?

109
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,541
I don't know.

110
00:16:11,582 --> 00:16:13,791
The whole roll is ruined.

111
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:17,375
That many?

112
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,250
What are these shadows?

113
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,832
My camera must be broken.

114
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:32,125
How should I tell Nuch?

115
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,750
Tun...

116
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,290
Look at this picture.

117
00:16:51,707 --> 00:16:52,957
That woman...

118
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:55,750
Do you think she's dead?

119
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:57,790
That's enough.

120
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:06,083
I'll have my camera fixed tomorrow.

121
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,165
Tun...

122
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:13,040
Look at this picture.

123
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,665
Are you sure it was here?

124
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,125
Excuse me.

125
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:49,415
What happened?

126
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,540
A few days ago a car hit the billboard.

127
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,165
Must have been drunk.

128
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,040
Was anyone hurt?

129
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,125
No.

130
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:03,208
Just the broken sign.

131
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,415
Are you sure?

132
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,083
What?

133
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,290
Nothing.

134
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,750
Thank you.

135
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,915
What?

136
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,833
You sure you checked everywhere?

137
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:24,165
Nothing.

138
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,665
Thanks anyways.

139
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,458
He called every precinct and hospital.

140
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,083
No accidents were reported that night.

141
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,165
That's not possible.

142
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,250
What about the girl we hit?

143
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,290
You sure he called every one?

144
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,708
Maybe someone helped her.

145
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,165
Maybe she's fine.

146
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,833
How could she be fine?

147
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,875
We ploughed her down.

148
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,875
And even if she's fine...

149
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,040
Something is in those pictures.

150
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,250
I told you they're not related to her.

151
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,040
They're just bad exposures.

152
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,125
Get it?

153
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,333
Tun...

154
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,250
You need to make some merit.

155
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,333
These pictures...

156
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,665
show that a spirit is haunting you.

157
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,500
How long have you been a photographer?

158
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,250
Why are you showing me these?

159
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,665
I know...

160
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,875
But don't you find these shadows strange?

161
00:21:41,915 --> 00:21:43,625
You want to see spirits?

162
00:21:44,165 --> 00:21:45,665
I'll show you some.

163
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,750
Here.

164
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,665
Auntie Cham's spirit.

165
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,165
You know where she is now?

166
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:05,165
She's selling grilled bananas next door.

167
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,375
Here's Auntie Cham. And here.

168
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,415
All Auntie Cham.

169
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,875
Taken on the same day.

170
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,708
They're just double exposures...

171
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,333
and out of focus.

172
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,333
Come on. I know that.

173
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:30,333
Everyone is familiar with this place.

174
00:22:31,415 --> 00:22:34,290
Just an ordinary location...

175
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,750
that we pass...

176
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,583
and see everyday.

177
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,000
Now look at these pictures...

178
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:54,250
taken of the same place.

179
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,833
In these...

180
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,290
the bridge looks nicer.

181
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:04,415
That means photography...

182
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:08,040
does not reproduce reality.

183
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,500
It depends on how...

184
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,083
the image is framed.

185
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,125
What is revealed.

186
00:23:17,415 --> 00:23:19,290
What is concealed.

187
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:23,250
Your perspective is critical.

<i>Special Scoop: Spirit Pictures</i>

189
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,875
Jane, you're early.

190
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,708
I'll get it.

191
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,083
Hello? / Hello, Tun.

192
00:24:04,415 --> 00:24:06,625
It's Jane. I'll come by later.

193
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,540
Hello?

194
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,083
Tun, can you hear me?

00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:12,750
Hello?

00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,750
Tun!

197
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,250
Tun!

198
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,583
Hello?

199
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,708
Hello?

200
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,625
What's wrong?

201
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,750
I don't know.

202
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,375
My neck's hurt since the accident.

203
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,250
You should go see a doctor.

204
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,583
I'm sure it's not serious.

205
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,875
What's the use of talking to these spoofs?

206
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:09,375
<i>Real Ghosts</i>

207
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,833
Are you a reporter?

208
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,125
No.

209
00:25:15,415 --> 00:25:18,208
The funeral foundation sent us.

210
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,833
We run a legal operation.

211
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,415
We have all the right permits.

212
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,375
Excuse me.

213
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,250
Are all these pictures fakes?

214
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,540
Piak! Tell the boss he has guests.

215
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,958
Everyone fakes them.

216
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:29,333
You know...

217
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,665
these photos are always a hit.

218
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,165
Any issue with them sells out.

219
00:26:35,915 --> 00:26:36,750
But you think...

220
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,540
we can always find real ones?

221
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,000
Isn't that deceiving the public?

222
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,333
Our readers...

223
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,083
want to see scary photos.

224
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,040
They don't want love stories.

225
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:58,208
Does that mean every photo is fake?

226
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,750
I didn't say that.

227
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,250
Take a look.

228
00:27:19,415 --> 00:27:20,540
See anything?

229
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:24,583
This is the first photo I had.

230
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,875
I took it at home.

231
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,040
The shadow...

232
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,708
bears a likeness to my mom.

233
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:38,500
Believe what you will.

234
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:41,583
But this picture...

235
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:45,000
was taken after she passed away.

236
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,415
You know...

237
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,915
sometimes...

238
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:53,040
spirits long for their loved ones.

239
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:00,958
In my opinion...

240
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,333
these pictures...

241
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:06,208
represent more than...

242
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,875
macabre urban legends.

243
00:28:10,665 --> 00:28:13,250
They are signs.

244
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,250
Think about it.

245
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,290
Why would the dead...

246
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:25,165
return to the living...

247
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:31,375
without a message to convey?

248
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:37,083
Most importantly...

249
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:39,708
I believe...

250
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:41,665
these shadows...

251
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:45,958
are related to someone in the picture.

252
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,000
A father...

253
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,333
mother...

254
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,333
or lover.

255
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,833
Or someone...

256
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,165
you maligned in life.

257
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,790
How can we tell if they're real...

258
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,333
and not fakes?

259
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:32,000
What about polaroids?

260
00:29:35,415 --> 00:29:36,750
Can you fake them?

261
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,875
You load the film and press the shutter.

262
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,000
The photo ejects.

263
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:02,290
Tell me then...

264
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:05,125
How can they be faked?

265
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:12,000
How do we know what they want?

266
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:13,458
Perhaps...

267
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:16,458
the answer is in the photo.

268
00:30:26,415 --> 00:30:28,708
Two more poses.

269
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,000
Big smiles.

270
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,333
Let's have a different pose.

271
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,165
Embrace her, hold the bouquet...

272
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,583
and kiss her cheek.

273
00:30:45,915 --> 00:30:47,250
Beautiful.

274
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,665
We're done.

275
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,750
Thank you both.

276
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:56,665
Take them to the dressing room.

277
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,333
What the...

278
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:27,415
Who's doing that?

279
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,625
Aum, check the fuse!

280
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,665
Hey! Aum!

281
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:39,665
Who's doing that?

282
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,875
Is it you, Aum?

283
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:50,290
Who is it?

284
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,833
Who's there!

285
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,415
I asked who it is!

286
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,583
Where are you, Aum?

287
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:16,958
Who's there!

288
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,458
Please step off the scale.

289
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,540
Step on it again.

290
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,000
Been working hard lately?

291
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,875
Not really.

292
00:33:28,665 --> 00:33:30,250
How long has it hurt?

293
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,665
For quite awhile.

294
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:35,290
But it's gotten worse lately.

295
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:38,000
I had a car accident.

296
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,708
An accident?

297
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,708
Physically, you're fine.

298
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:45,083
You shouldn't worry.

299
00:33:45,665 --> 00:33:48,790
But it really hurts.

300
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:52,125
Your x-rays are normal.

301
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,165
It may be a sprain.

302
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:56,833
Try the medicine I prescribed.

303
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,040
Mr. Tun, please pick up your prescription.

304
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,583
Take this medicine...

305
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:08,583
3 times a day after meals...

306
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,958
until the prescription runs out.

307
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,458
Lying bastard.

308
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:16,500
Pardon?

309
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:17,458
Yes?

310
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,541
Nothing.

311
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:27,041
Lying bastard.

312
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:30,791
Lying bastard.

313
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,958
As for this medicine...

314
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:35,500
Sir!

315
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,791
What's wrong?

316
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,708
...is rarely seen.

317
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,041
When grasshoppers begin mating...

318
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:49,583
the male smells the female...

319
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:54,083
from a distance up to 100 meters.

320
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,125
The male carefully approaches the female.

321
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:02,750
It hooks itself onto her belly.

322
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:05,250
And they begin to mate.

323
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,541
The female's response is surprising.

324
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:15,458
The male becomes her prey.

325
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:19,791
She slowly eats off his head...

326
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:23,083
while they are mating.

327
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:25,916
Eventually...

328
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,500
the male succumbs to death.

329
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:40,791
Excuse me, where is Room 301?

330
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:53,625
Jane.

331
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:04,875
Jane.

332
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,250
Who's there?

333
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,291
Tonn...

334
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,000
What's wrong?

335
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:56,333
Tun...

336
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:57,791
I'm going to die.

337
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,208
What's going on?

338
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,041
The photos...

339
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,208
Bring me those photos.

340
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,333
What photos?

341
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,666
Are you drunk?

342
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:11,666
Those photos...

343
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13,666
Where did you hide them?

344
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,208
Give them to me.

345
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,916
Remember that bitch.

346
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,333
Calm down.

347
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,166
What photos?

348
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:24,208
Just give them to me!

349
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:26,458
Please calm down.

350
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,208
Tonn, calm down.

351
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
What photos?

352
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,458
Tonn.

353
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,833
I'll call your wife.

354
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,333
What are you doing?

355
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:28,750
Cleaning up.

356
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,583
Your neck still sore?

357
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,958
Yeah.

358
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,583
Take it easy. Don't work so much.

359
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,875
Natrenapa Chan-ngam, Honor Society 1995

360
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:39,166
Tonn.

361
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:41,708
It's Tun.

362
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:45,041
Are you home?

363
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:00,916
Tonn.

364
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,958
Are you home?

365
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:15,250
Tonn.

366
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:43,041
Natrenapa Chan-ngam

367
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:32,375
Tonn!

368
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,750
Tonn!

369
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,708
Tonn!

370
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:47,166
Tonn!

371
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:26,750
I'm really sorry.

372
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:29,125
Do you know...

373
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:31,208
what was bothering him?

374
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:36,791
No. Suddenly he...

375
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:39,625
It's your gang's fault.

376
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:43,375
Have you all gone insane?

377
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:46,750
What do you mean?

378
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:50,166
You've all committed suicide.

379
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:52,416
Who?

380
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:55,500
Don't you know?

381
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:57,458
The other two...

382
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,666
also killed themselves.

383
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:02,083
Which two?

384
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:09,041
The two who sat next to you.

385
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:57,291
Who's this woman?

386
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:03,125
Where did you get that?

387
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:07,041
She's the shadow in the photos, right?

388
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,708
Who is she?

389
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:14,666
How is she related to you?

390
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:35,875
I knew her in college.

391
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:40,375
Her name is Natre.

392
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:46,125
She was a quiet person...

393
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:49,541
without any friends.

394
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,166
We all thought she was weird.

395
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,958
I felt sorry for her.

396
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:13,208
We dated but I kept it secret.

397
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,166
She loved me a lot.

398
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:18,583
She threatened to slit her wrists.

399
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,833
I didn't know what to do.

400
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:24,083
My friends thought it was funny.

401
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:26,375
How were they involved?

402
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:28,083
Why are they dead?

403
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:29,166
They...

404
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:31,333
What did they do?

405
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:35,000
I don't know.

406
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:39,208
Tonn said he'd take care of it.

407
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:45,166
After that, Natre disappeared.

408
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:48,625
I never saw her again.

409
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:52,333
Didn't you try to stop them?

410
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,375
How could you let it happen?

411
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:05,625
What could I do?

412
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,916
Now everyone is dead.

413
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:14,500
I'm...

414
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:17,250
I'm going to die next.

415
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:58,708
It's funny how...

416
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:03,458
we always say...

417
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:06,541
if we could turn back time...

418
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:08,750
we...

419
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:11,416
we would reverse all our wrongs.

420
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,583
Do you think she's okay?

421
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:19,625
Will she be there?

422
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:20,916
Go to sleep.

423
00:55:23,416 --> 00:55:25,416
I'll keep you company tonight.

424
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:36,458
Excuse me.

425
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,416
Do you have any toilet paper?

426
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:17,166
Can I poo first?

427
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:18,250
I'm sorry.

428
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:32,000
What's bothering you?

429
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,291
What's wrong?

430
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:01,250
What is it?

431
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,708
Is it around here?

432
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:09,916
Excuse me.

433
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,708
Do you know where this is?

434
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,458
Mom, where is this house?

435
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:54,666
Ma'am.

436
01:02:08,083 --> 01:02:09,333
Excuse me...

437
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:11,333
Is this Natre's house?

438
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:14,333
What do you want?

439
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:16,458
Well...

440
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:19,291
We're her friends.

441
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:22,916
Natre's friends? Come inside.

442
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,541
Have some water. You must be tired.

443
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:38,791
Did you drive from Bangkok?

444
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:41,000
Yes.

445
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:48,041
We'd like to ask about Natre.

446
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,000
She's not feeling well.

447
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:53,291
She's taking a nap.

448
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:56,125
Should I wake her?

449
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:02,250
Stay for dinner.

450
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:04,333
I was about to cook.

451
01:03:04,583 --> 01:03:07,166
I'm making her favorite dish.

452
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,708
Natre will be so happy.

453
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,000
Her friends don't visit often.

454
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:15,000
Wait right here.

455
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:36,041
Where are you going?

456
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,458
How dare you?

457
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:03,541
Did she commit suicide?

458
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:10,791
We should cremate her.

459
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:14,041
No.

460
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,875
I won't cremate her.

461
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:19,125
Ma'am...

462
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,750
I don't know if you believe such things...

463
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:27,541
but I'd like you to look at these photos.

464
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:32,208
They were taken around campus.

465
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:37,166
Some of the places...

466
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:40,583
were rooms Natre had been in.

467
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,125
And these shadows appeared.

468
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:50,500
I think that...

469
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:55,208
Natre's spirit is restless.

470
01:05:56,666 --> 01:05:57,833
Natre...

471
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,250
My dear Natre.

472
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,666
Why don't you visit me?

473
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:19,166
Can you tell me what happened?

474
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:21,625
Why she left Bangkok?

475
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:31,541
Ma'am...

476
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:35,000
Ma'am.

477
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:38,541
These shadows...

478
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:42,666
might mean her spirit is not at peace.

479
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,666
We should hold her funeral.

480
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:52,000
Please.

481
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:08,625
When she came home...

482
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:10,125
she seemed different.

483
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:12,458
She wouldn't talk to anyone.

484
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:15,333
No one knows what happened in Bangkok.

485
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:19,416
Then she overdosed on pills.

486
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,750
Luckily, her mother found her...

487
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:25,041
and got her to the hospital on time.

488
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:27,875
When she recovered...

489
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:32,250
she climbed on the hospital roof...

490
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,625
and jumped off the edge.

491
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:39,666
Why wouldn't her mom cremate her?

492
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:45,291
She's been distraught ever since Natre's death.

493
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:49,416
No matter what she refused to cremate her.

494
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:53,333
All the villagers were scared.

495
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:56,791
No one wanted to socialize with her.

496
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:05,707
Can't sleep?

497
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:13,957
Tell me the truth...

498
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,582
Did you love Natre?

499
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:22,541
I tried to...

500
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:31,791
I believed that one day I would.

501
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:39,707
But I was fooling myself.

502
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,541
When I broke it off...

503
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,332
I was a total asshole.

504
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:01,750
But she still loved me the same.

505
01:11:08,291 --> 01:11:10,250
I want this to be over.

506
01:11:12,332 --> 01:11:14,582
If she wants me to die I will.

507
01:11:15,957 --> 01:11:17,666
Don't say that.

508
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:20,582
It's almost over.

509
01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:23,207
No it's not.

510
01:11:28,457 --> 01:11:30,832
I know she'll come for me.

511
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:32,875
Tun.

512
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:35,791
We've come this far.

513
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:40,207
And you're sorry for what you did.

514
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:42,666
I'm sure she knows.

515
01:11:44,957 --> 01:11:47,291
Don't talk about death anymore.

516
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,416
I'm sorry.

517
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:03,541
Do you still love me?

518
01:12:09,416 --> 01:12:12,000
No matter what you won't leave me, right?

519
01:13:55,832 --> 01:13:56,750
Jane.

520
01:13:57,082 --> 01:13:58,082
Jane.

521
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,125
Tun...

522
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:37,666
Jane...

523
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:39,916
Where did you go?

524
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,457
Why did you leave me alone?

525
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:45,291
We've got to leave.

526
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:50,000
Asshole!

527
01:15:51,291 --> 01:15:52,957
Why did you leave me?

528
01:15:53,207 --> 01:15:54,916
Didn't you love me?

529
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:56,832
How could you leave me?

530
01:15:59,916 --> 01:16:02,500
How could you leave me?

531
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:46,375
Tun...

532
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:48,750
Are you feeling better?

533
01:17:51,207 --> 01:17:53,166
What happened last night?

534
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:55,707
Tun...

535
01:17:57,457 --> 01:17:58,500
Jane...

536
01:17:58,832 --> 01:18:00,041
Jane...

537
01:18:07,332 --> 01:18:08,707
The abbot said...

538
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,041
Natre will be cremated today.

539
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,082
It's over.

540
01:20:16,707 --> 01:20:18,750
Hello. / Hello, Jane.

541
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,582
Picking up photos?

542
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:22,082
Where's Tun?

543
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:23,332
He's busy.

544
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:24,832
Good.

545
01:20:25,166 --> 01:20:26,500
When he's busy...

546
01:20:26,541 --> 01:20:27,957
I get to see you.

547
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:37,957
You went on vacation?

548
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:40,166
To the beach.

549
01:20:40,207 --> 01:20:41,707
When did you go?

550
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:44,000
Last week.

551
01:20:47,207 --> 01:20:48,916
This photo is...

552
01:20:51,916 --> 01:20:53,291
What's wrong?

553
01:20:59,457 --> 01:21:00,582
You look fatter.

554
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,250
I didn't recognize you.

555
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:08,500
Hi.

556
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:10,625
Jumbo prints.

557
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:13,625
Write your name, please.

558
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:01,166
Get her guys!

559
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:39,375
Jane...

560
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:41,957
Why are you crying?

561
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,750
Asshole...

562
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:50,250
How could you be so cruel?

563
01:24:56,582 --> 01:24:57,875
Where did you find these?

564
01:25:00,541 --> 01:25:02,375
If I didn't find them...

565
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:05,207
I'd be a fool forever, right?

566
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,582
Let me explain.

567
01:25:15,832 --> 01:25:17,832
What's there to say?

568
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,082
I always believed you.

569
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,166
I thought I knew you.

570
01:25:47,666 --> 01:25:48,875
Tun.

571
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:51,332
Take her picture...

572
01:25:51,375 --> 01:25:52,666
so she doesn't blab.

573
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:55,082
Tun, help me.

574
01:25:56,707 --> 01:25:58,250
I know it was wrong.

575
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,666
Take her picture now!

576
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:04,000
What's wrong!

577
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:07,207
I'm your buddy!

578
01:26:07,666 --> 01:26:08,916
Hurry!

579
01:26:17,666 --> 01:26:19,875
Tun, help me.

580
01:26:33,707 --> 01:26:35,500
I never forgave myself.

581
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:37,500
But I was young and stupid.

582
01:26:39,041 --> 01:26:40,582
I've heard enough.

583
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,457
I'm going home.

584
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:42,666
Come on out!

585
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:48,832
Where are you?

586
01:27:55,916 --> 01:27:57,750
I thought you loved me!

587
01:28:00,082 --> 01:28:02,041
Loved me so much!

588
01:28:09,582 --> 01:28:11,832
Till death do us part!

589
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:18,957
She's gone now.

590
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:03,750
Sometimes...

591
01:30:03,791 --> 01:30:05,872
spirits long for their loved ones.

592
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,119
