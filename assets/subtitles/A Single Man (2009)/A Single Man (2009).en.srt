00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:04,918
Friday, 30 November, 1962

3
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,775
Waking up begins with saying
''am'' and ''now''.

4
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,276
Jennifer, I'm not gonna tell you again.

5
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:47,978
For the past eight months waking
up has actually hurt.

6
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:56,485
The cold realization that
I'm still here slowly sets in.

7
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:00,770
I was never teribly fond of waking up.

8
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,316
I was never one to jump out of bed and
greet the day with a smile like Jim was.

9
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:09,915
I used to want to punch him sometimes
in the morning he was so happy.

10
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:13,752
I always used to tell him that only fools
greet the day with a smile...

11
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,755
...that only fools possibly
escape the simple truth.

12
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:19,706
That now isn't simply now.

13
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:24,012
It's a cold reminder.
One day later than yesterday.

14
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:27,682
One year later than last year.

15
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:32,093
And that sooner or later it will come.

16
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:35,566
He used to laugh at me and then
give me kiss on the cheek.

17
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:40,394
It takes time in the morning
for me to become George.

18
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:44,898
The time to adjust to what is expected
of George and how he is to behave.

19
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:49,579
By the time I have dressed and
put the final layer of polish...

20
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:54,042
...on the now slightly stiff
but quite perfect George...

21
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:57,545
...I know fully what part
I'm supposed to play

22
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:13,550
Looking in the mirror staring back at me
isn't so much as a face...

23
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:16,898
...as the expression of a predicament.

24
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:20,182
Just get through the goddamn day.

25
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:25,021
A bit melodramatic, I guess.

26
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,490
But then again...

27
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:30,661
...my heart has been broken.

28
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:34,112
I feel as if I am sinking, drowning...

29
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:36,543
...can't breathe.

30
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,016
Aren't you going to say something?
Are you kidding? It's spectacular.

31
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:35,432
What are you doing?

32
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:38,007
Just stop it.
Stop it.

33
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:40,312
I don't think that you're quite
ready for life in a glass house.

34
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,191
Drapes, old man.

35
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,612
You're the one who is always saying
that we are invisible.

36
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:52,189
That's not exactly what I meant.

37
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:18,141
For the first time in my life
I can't see my future.

38
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:22,105
Every day goes by in a haze.

39
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:26,223
But today I have decided
will be different.

40
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:40,069
Finally. You know it's been
raining here all day.

41
00:07:40,204 --> 00:07:42,832
I've been trapped in this house
waiting for you to call.

42
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:46,533
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.
I'm calling for Mr. George Falconer.

43
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:51,716
I'm sorry, I was expecting someone else.
Yes sir, you have indeed called the...

44
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,834
...correct number. How may I help you?
- This is Harold Ackerley.

45
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:56,586
I'm Jim's cousin.

46
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,016
Of course.
Yes, good evening Mr. Ackerley.

47
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,519
I'm afraid I'm calling with
some bad news.

48
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,107
There has been a car accident.

49
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,451
An accident?

50
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:12,548
There has been a lot of snow here
lately and the roads have been icy.

51
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:17,367
On his way into town,
Jim lost control of his car.

52
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:20,620
It was instantaneous apparently.

53
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:29,617
It happened late yesterday, but his
parents didnt want to call you.

54
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:33,830
I see.

55
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:36,165
In fact, they don't that
I'm calling you now.

56
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:38,751
But I thought that you should know.

57
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:46,717
Thank you.

58
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:51,192
I know this must be quite a shock.
It was for all of us.

59
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:54,809
Yes, indeed.

60
00:08:58,657 --> 00:09:01,524
- Will there be a service?
- The day after tomorrow.

61
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:08,833
Well, I suppose I should
get off the phone...

62
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,961
...and book a plane flight.

63
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:15,048
The service is just for family.

64
00:09:17,842 --> 00:09:19,635
For family, of course.

65
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:24,765
Well, thank you for calling.

66
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,061
- Mr. Ackerley?
- Yes?

67
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:32,065
- May I ask what happened to the dogs?
- Dogs?

68
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:36,528
There was a dog with him but he died.
Was there another one?

69
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,614
Yes, there was a small female.

70
00:09:39,697 --> 00:09:41,605
I don't know, I'm sorry.

71
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:44,409
I haven't heard anyone
mentioning another dog.

72
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,087
- Well, thank you for calling Mr. Ackerley.
- Goodbye, Mr. Falconer.

73
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:46,554
Hello, Charley.

74
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,472
How did you know it was me?

75
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:51,402
Charlotte, nobody else calls me
before eight in the morning.

76
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:55,405
I didn't call too early, did I?
You sound grumpy.

77
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,063
No, I have a headache.

78
00:13:57,158 --> 00:14:01,453
Listen, I was going to call you actually.
Is too late to change my mind about tonight.

79
00:14:01,578 --> 00:14:05,280
No, of course not.
I haven't seen you all week.

80
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:09,243
- I'm dying for a dose of you.
- I know, I'm sorry.

81
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:12,048
So great, I'll see you tonight.

82
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,956
I have to run.
I'm late for the work.

83
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:16,332
I'll call you later from school.

84
00:14:16,427 --> 00:14:18,418
Alright, I see you then.

85
00:14:18,513 --> 00:14:21,004
- Bye, kiddo.
- Bye, old man.

86
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:07,519
Good morning, Mr. George.

87
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:11,648
Sir, you don't look so good today.

88
00:15:11,684 --> 00:15:13,921
Good morning, Alva.
No, I didn't sleep very well.

89
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,860
You forgot to take the bread
out of the freezer this morning.

90
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:18,312
It stays fresh that way.

91
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:20,823
It was a little too fresh this morning.

92
00:15:20,907 --> 00:15:22,563
There are some papers
laid out on my desk...

93
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,754
...which need to stay there.
Please don't move them.

94
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:28,581
- I'm afraid my pen leaked all over the bed.
- It's okay, sir.

95
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:30,490
- Alva?
- Yes, sir?

96
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,294
Thank you, you're a wonderful.

97
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:47,094
<i>This government, as promised,
has maintained the closest surveillance...

98
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:51,355
<i>...of the Soviet military buildup
on the Island of Cuba.

99
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:55,361
<i>Within the past week unmistakable evidence...

100
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,793
<i>...has established the fact...

101
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:08,997
- Professor Falconer?
- Yes?

102
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:11,432
There was a student here this
morning asking for your address.

103
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,648
My address?

104
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:17,038
- Did you give it to him?
- Yes, sir.

105
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:18,373
I did.

106
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,115
I hope that's okay.

107
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:24,045
I realize that I probably shouldn't
have but he was very nice.

108
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,588
Before I knew it he...

109
00:18:27,632 --> 00:18:30,582
Your hair looks great up like that.
I really fits suits you.

110
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,836
You always look so beautiful...

111
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,171
...really fresh...

112
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:38,808
You have such a lovely smile.

113
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,349
- Arpège?
- Sir?

114
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:51,979
Really beautiful.

115
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:04,743
<i>...that a series of offensive missile sites...

116
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:07,546
- Good morning, Don.
- Good morning, George.

117
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:24,676
Good morning, George.

118
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:27,305
Good morning, Grant.

119
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:30,693
You look awful.
What have you been doing?

120
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:35,563
Look around you, Grant.

121
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:38,775
Most of these students aspire to
nothing more than corporate job...

122
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:42,403
...and a desire to raise coke-drinking,
TV-watching children...

123
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:44,822
...who as soon as they can
speak start chanting TV jingles...

124
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:48,034
...and smashing things with hammers.
- You're really scaring me today, George.

125
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:50,131
Don't tell me. You have
easy time with these students.

126
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,965
I found them staring at me
in a kind of bovine stupor...

127
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:54,624
...as if I were lecturing in
a foreign language.

128
00:19:54,718 --> 00:19:57,177
Remind me why we shouldn't
all just be annihilated.

129
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:58,761
You seem to think this is all a joke.

130
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:01,586
We're living in a world where
nuclear war is a real threat.

131
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:03,644
I don't understand how
that doesn't concern you.

132
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:05,425
You're serious, aren't you?

133
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,385
Yes, I'm serious.

134
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:09,763
George did you even read the article
I gave you on bomb shelters?

135
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:11,673
Our is almost done. We had 3
contractors work on it...

136
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,335
...so none of them know what we've got.

137
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:16,404
I'm having the outside of it landscaped
so no one will that it's there.

138
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:17,354
Really?

139
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,666
If word gets out that
you've got a better shelter...

140
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:24,903
...then everyone will try to get in
when something happens.

141
00:20:24,997 --> 00:20:26,332
So?

142
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:29,532
There will be no time for sentiment
when the Russians fire a missile at us.

143
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:32,766
If it's going to be a world with
no time for sentiment Grant...

144
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:34,452
...the it's not a world
that I want to live in.

145
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:23,011
After Many a Summer Dies the Swan.

146
00:21:28,142 --> 00:21:29,563
I think you've all...

147
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:34,023
...read the Huxley novel I assigned
more than three weeks ago?

148
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:40,560
How does the title relate to our story?

149
00:21:41,489 --> 00:21:43,646
- Yes, Mr. Mong.
- It doesn't.

150
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,652
It's about a rich guy who's too
afraid that he's too old for this girl...

151
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:51,665
...and thinks that a young guy...

152
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:20,517
Russ.

153
00:22:32,748 --> 00:22:35,500
Russ?

154
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,174
Yes, Mr. Hirsch.

155
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:57,802
Sir, on page 79, Mr. Propter says that...

156
00:22:57,896 --> 00:23:01,650
...the stupidest text in the Bible is
they hated me without a cause.

157
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:04,508
Does that mean the Nazis were
right to hate the Jews?

158
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:06,779
- Is Huxley an anti-Semite?
- No.

159
00:23:15,247 --> 00:23:17,916
No, Mr. Huxley is not an anti-Semite.

160
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,007
Of course, the Nazis were
wrong to hate the Jews.

161
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:23,132
But their hating the Jews
was not without a cause.

162
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:27,790
It's just that the cause wasn't real.

163
00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:30,836
The cause was imagined.

164
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,641
The cause was fear.

165
00:23:35,476 --> 00:23:37,936
Let's leave the Jews out o
this just for a moment.

166
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:42,513
Let's think of another minority.
One that...

167
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:44,818
One that can go unnoticed if it needs to.

168
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:50,897
There are all sorts of minorities,
blondes for example...

169
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,201
...or people with freckles.

170
00:23:54,618 --> 00:23:57,486
But a minority is only
thought of as one...

171
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:00,916
...when it constitutes some kind of
threat to the majority.

172
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,461
A real threat or an imagined one.

173
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:05,869
And therein lies the fear.

174
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:12,053
If the minority is somehow invisible...

175
00:24:13,346 --> 00:24:15,922
...and the fear is much greater.

176
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:19,994
That fear is why the
minority is persecuted.

177
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:21,550
So, you see there always is a cause.

178
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:22,739
The cause is fear.

179
00:24:23,272 --> 00:24:24,982
Minorities are just people.

180
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:27,861
People like us.

181
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:37,317
I can see that I've lost you a bit.

182
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:41,572
So tell you what? We're gonna
forget about Mr. Huxley today...

183
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,377
...and we're gonna talk about fear.

184
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,587
Fear, after all, is our real enemy.

185
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:50,798
Fear is taking over our world.

186
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:54,750
Fear is being used as a tool of
manipulation in our society.

187
00:24:54,845 --> 00:24:58,432
It's how politicians peddle policy.

188
00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:01,298
It's how Madison Avenue sells us
things that we don't need.

189
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:02,968
Think about it.

190
00:25:04,313 --> 00:25:05,855
Fear of being attacked.

191
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:10,611
Fear of that there are communists
lurking around every corner.

192
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:12,848
Fear of that some little
Caribbean country...

193
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:15,398
...that doesn't believe in our way
of life poses a threat to us.

194
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:17,674
Fear that black culture
may take over the world.

195
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:20,828
Fear of Elvis Presley's hips.

196
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:24,196
Actually, maybe that one is a real fear.

197
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,631
Fear that our bad breath
might ruin our friendships.

198
00:25:33,342 --> 00:25:35,885
Fear of growing old and being alone.

199
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:47,520
The of that we're useless and that
no one cares what we have to say.

200
00:25:52,108 --> 00:25:53,767
Have a good weekend.

201
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:02,984
Sir! May I talk to you for a minute?

202
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,830
Why don't you always
talk to us like that?

203
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:07,740
I don't think it went over very well.

204
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,075
Man, fear of things gets
to me all the time.

205
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:13,119
But you can't talk about it with
anyone or you just sound like a fool.

206
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:17,050
- You can't even talk about it with Lois?
- I don't think she's afraid of anything.

207
00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:19,125
Everyone's afraid of something, Kenny.

208
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,012
What are you afraid of, sir?

209
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:22,807
Cars.

210
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,374
How can you live in Los Angeles
and be afraid of cars?

211
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,588
Maybe you can't.

212
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,305
Sometimes my fear of things
can almost paralyze me.

213
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:35,641
It's like I get really panic stricken and
I feel like I might explode or something.

214
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:39,228
- May I ask you a personal question, sir?
- If you like.

215
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:42,241
Do you ever get high?

216
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:47,028
- How old do I look to you?
- Have you ever taken any drugs?

217
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:48,820
Of course, Kenny.

218
00:26:49,457 --> 00:26:50,573
Like what?

219
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:54,826
I don't feel I should be discussing this
with you on campus Mr. Potter.

220
00:26:54,921 --> 00:26:58,173
It's the only way I get by sometimes.

221
00:26:58,258 --> 00:27:01,709
- Have you ever tried mescaline?
- Not my drug of choice.

222
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:05,755
I shaved off one of my eyebrows once
on mescaline. Not a good look for me.

223
00:27:05,848 --> 00:27:08,601
- Sir?
- I looked in the mirror.

224
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:10,425
Big mistake if you're high on mescaline.

225
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,189
I decided that my eyebrows
were taking over my face.

226
00:27:13,272 --> 00:27:14,573
Before I knew it, I had shaved one off.

227
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:17,372
I wore a band-aid over my eye for about
six weeks while my brow grew back.

228
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:18,267
Very embarrassing.

229
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:21,530
- You didn't take it again after that?
- Kenny, have you been listening to me?

230
00:27:21,614 --> 00:27:23,940
I shaved off my eyebrow.

231
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:27,067
I wanted an experience Mr. Potter,
not a career on stage.

232
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:34,031
If you ever want to get high sir,
I usually have some dope.

233
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,201
You're really mad aren't you?

234
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:46,788
I'm sorry, sir. I guess you don't feel
very comfortable talking like this.

235
00:27:46,824 --> 00:27:48,297
What makes you say that?

236
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,842
Lois thinks you're kind of cagey.
Like this morning...

237
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:54,885
...when you were listening to all that
crap we were talking about Huxley.

238
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,065
Well, not all of you.

239
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:58,192
I didn't notice you open
your mouth once.

240
00:27:58,275 --> 00:27:59,984
I was watching you.

241
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:04,781
You let us ramble on and on
and then you straighten us out.

242
00:28:04,865 --> 00:28:08,201
But you never really tell us
everything you know about something.

243
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:12,528
Well, maybe that's true up to a point.

244
00:28:13,915 --> 00:28:15,709
It's not that I want to be cagey.

245
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,953
It's just that I can't really discuss
things completely openly...

246
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:22,329
...at school.

247
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:24,549
Someone would misunderstand.

248
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:29,420
I tried that today.
It didn't really work out.

249
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:38,261
What was it you wanted to get, sir?

250
00:28:38,355 --> 00:28:40,681
Nothing. I was on my way
to the dean's office.

251
00:28:40,775 --> 00:28:43,443
You mean you walked all the way
down here just to talk to me?

252
00:28:43,528 --> 00:28:45,435
- Why not?
- Well...

253
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:48,646
I think you deserve
something for that, sir.

254
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,772
Here sir, take your pick.

255
00:28:51,701 --> 00:28:53,829
- It's on me.
- Thank you.

256
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,126
I thought you'd probably pick blue.

257
00:29:00,127 --> 00:29:03,213
- Why blue?
- Isn't blue supposed to be spiritual?

258
00:29:03,297 --> 00:29:05,007
What makes you think I'm spiritual?

259
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:09,960
And you? Red?

260
00:29:12,013 --> 00:29:14,589
- What is red stand for?
- A lot of things.

261
00:29:14,683 --> 00:29:16,674
Rage, lust.

262
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:19,354
No kidding?

263
00:29:25,152 --> 00:29:26,528
Well sir, I...

264
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:28,102
I guess I see you around.

265
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:51,643
Hello?

266
00:30:51,737 --> 00:30:53,478
What are you up to, kiddo?

267
00:30:53,572 --> 00:30:57,326
Just trying to finish up a book.
How's your day going?

268
00:30:57,409 --> 00:30:58,576
Fine.

269
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:02,373
I was just leaving school and wanted to
know if you needed anything for tonight.

270
00:31:02,455 --> 00:31:04,666
Thanks, you're sweet.

271
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,961
But I think I'm all set.

272
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:09,492
Be a darling and...

273
00:31:09,586 --> 00:31:14,749
...pick up gin for me, Tangueray.
I love the color of the bottle.

274
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:18,419
You love what's in it.
What time do you want me?

275
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:22,048
7 would be great if that's ok with you.

276
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:24,925
Perfect. I'll see you then.

277
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:27,010
I'll see you then.
Bye, Geo.

278
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:28,272
Bye, kiddo.

279
00:31:50,878 --> 00:31:52,869
Beautiful.

280
00:32:47,851 --> 00:32:50,394
- Yes, Mr. Potter?
- Are you going somewhere, sir?

281
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:53,430
That is usually why people
get into their cars.

282
00:32:53,522 --> 00:32:55,729
No, I mean are you going on
vacation or something?

283
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,057
- What?
- I saw you cleaning out your office.

284
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,191
What exactly is it that you want, Kenny?

285
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:11,529
I was just hoping that perhaps we could get
together for a drink or something sometime.

286
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,032
Why is that?

287
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:16,796
I don't know, sir.

288
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,589
Because I think you might like it.
And...

289
00:33:21,384 --> 00:33:23,041
...because you seem as though
you could use a friend.

290
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,680
- Oh really?
- Yes, sir. You do.

291
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:32,310
They may be right.

292
00:33:33,854 --> 00:33:36,481
It will have to be another time.
I'm late.

293
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,359
But thank you for the invitation.

294
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:42,863
And thank you for the talk earlier.

295
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:46,397
And stay away from the mescaline.

296
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:20,358
Hello, Mr. Falconer.

297
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:22,818
- Hello. How are you today?
- I'm fine, sir.

298
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:25,447
- Do you need to get into your box?
- Yes, I do.

299
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,864
Follow me.

300
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:36,750
Here you are, sir.

301
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,003
If you could please sign here...

302
00:34:49,762 --> 00:34:51,096
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

303
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:01,322
So explain your friend Charlotte to me.

304
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:04,626
What would you like to know?

305
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,255
I don't know.
You seem very intimate I guess.

306
00:36:08,588 --> 00:36:11,509
Like you were once
together or something.

307
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:14,846
- You haven't slept with her, have you?
- Yes.

308
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,755
And?

309
00:36:20,143 --> 00:36:22,300
A few times when we were young.

310
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,324
I wouldn't say that it
meant nothing to me...

311
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,025
...but it certainly meant
a great deal more to Charley.

312
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:29,266
It was a long time ago in London.

313
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,144
I love Charley.

314
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,240
- And We were very close friends
but that's all. - Well, I'm confused.

315
00:36:37,576 --> 00:36:39,619
If you sleep with women
then why are you with me?

316
00:36:39,702 --> 00:36:41,777
Because I fall in love with men.

317
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:43,947
Because I fell in love with you.

318
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:48,545
Anyway, doesn't everyone sleep with
women when they're young?

319
00:36:48,628 --> 00:36:51,172
- I haven't.
- You're joking.

320
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:53,498
No, I'm not.

321
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:55,451
It was just never anything
that interested me.

322
00:36:55,487 --> 00:36:58,420
Well, you're awfully
modern aren't you?

323
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:01,516
You know, I think that was the first
thing that I noticed about you...

324
00:37:02,726 --> 00:37:04,936
...was how sure of yourself you were.

325
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:10,472
How can you be so sure about
everything at your age?

326
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,487
You think I'm sure of myself?

327
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,614
Of course, you are.

328
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,418
I'm finished now.
Thank you.

329
00:37:45,266 --> 00:37:47,009
Yes, Mr. Falconer?

330
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:49,938
Is there something else we
can help you with today?

331
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:53,472
I can't find my check book
and I need some cash.

332
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:55,893
Not my day I'm afraid.
Excuse me a minute.

333
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:54,210
Mommy says bushy eyebrows are pedestrian,
but I think yours are pretty.

334
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:57,547
I think yours are pretty too.

335
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,706
Why do you look so sad?
Would you like to meet Charlton Heston?

336
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:04,762
Ben Hur.

337
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,547
He's our scorpion.

338
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:13,802
Every night we throw in something
new to him and watch him kill it.

339
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:18,222
Daddy says it's like the colosseum. So my
brother Tom put on all the columns in here.

340
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:20,027
He wants to be a set designer.

341
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:22,795
He hasn't eaten the spider yet...

342
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:25,672
...cause he's still full from
the moth we gave him last night.

343
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:29,567
Daddy says he wants to throw
you in to the colosseum.

344
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,871
No kidding?
Why?

345
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:34,905
He says you're light in your loafers...

346
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,043
...but you aren't even wearing loafers.

347
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:39,253
I think my brother Tom is
light in his loafers too...

348
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:41,746
...but he wears Keds.

349
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:47,887
He made me do a hair conditioning
treatment on my hair with eggs.

350
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:50,474
Does it look shiny?

351
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:52,934
Sweetheart, what are you doing
bothering Mr. Falconer?

352
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:55,686
She's not bothering me at all Susan.
How are you?

353
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:58,231
I'm glad to see you George.

354
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:02,043
George, we're having a few people
over tonight for drinks...

355
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,905
...and would love to have you
join us if you could.

356
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:08,867
- Thank you. That's very kind of you but I
have plans. - Another time then.

357
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,525
Jennifer, let's let Mr. Falconer get
back to his banking.

358
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:12,900
Goodbye, George.

359
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,871
Bye, Susan.
Bye, Jennifer.

360
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:28,302
- May I help you, sir? - I'd like to buy
some bullets for this gun, please.

361
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:32,222
Yes, sir.
This is a really old gun, sir.

362
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:34,630
We have a two for one sale on
handguns at the moment.

363
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,969
- Perhaps one for the little lady?
- No thank you. Just the bullets, please.

364
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,775
- Here you go. Anything else?
- No, thank you.

365
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,902
That would be $2.29, sir.

366
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,240
Thank you.

367
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:31,072
I'm sorry. I hope she
didn't growl at you.

368
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,365
She goes a little crazy sometimes when
I have to leave her in the car.

369
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,273
She's perfect.
What's her name?

370
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,193
India.

371
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,860
Let's go there.

372
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,952
You little baby.

373
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:52,885
I used to have smooth fox terriers.
You don't see them very often.

374
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,521
The very smell of buttered toast.

375
00:42:16,824 --> 00:42:18,233
She's still a puppy isn't she?

376
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,990
Well.

377
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,295
- Have a nice evening.
- You too.

378
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:29,755
Good night, India.

379
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,385
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, It's ok.

380
00:42:45,478 --> 00:42:49,858
- It's my fault. I'll get you another pack.
- It's ok. Don't worry.

381
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,902
No, no I insist.

382
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,324
Thank you.

383
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:00,148
I'm sorry about the broken glass.

384
00:43:00,909 --> 00:43:02,702
- Here you go.
- Thanks man.

385
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:05,956
You want one?

386
00:43:06,748 --> 00:43:08,740
No, thanks.

387
00:43:09,835 --> 00:43:11,628
Actually, yes.
Why not?

388
00:43:12,295 --> 00:43:13,496
Thank you.

389
00:43:45,163 --> 00:43:46,956
- Carlos.
- What did you say?

390
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:49,532
Carlos. You asked me my name.

391
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,585
Are you okay?

392
00:43:51,668 --> 00:43:53,409
Yeah.

393
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:55,838
Yeah, I'm sorry.

394
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:01,733
You're really something.

395
00:44:02,177 --> 00:44:04,429
You have an incredible face.

396
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,360
Enjoy that. It's a great gift.

397
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:08,851
Your Spanish is perfect.

398
00:44:08,976 --> 00:44:10,311
Thank you.

399
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:16,099
I should have used it more.

400
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:17,646
Well...

401
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:19,759
It's not too late.

402
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:48,170
What are you doing?

403
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:51,550
Aren't we going somewhere?

404
00:44:51,643 --> 00:44:54,480
No. But, thanks.

405
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,286
You know, it's the smog that
makes it that color.

406
00:45:03,322 --> 00:45:05,490
I've never seen a sky like this before.

407
00:45:06,942 --> 00:45:10,684
Sometimes awful things have
their own kind of beauty.

408
00:45:15,668 --> 00:45:17,159
Could I have another cigarette?

409
00:45:17,253 --> 00:45:18,827
Sure.

410
00:45:47,072 --> 00:45:49,909
- Are sure that you don't want to go
for a drive? - I'm sure.

411
00:45:53,496 --> 00:45:55,320
- Where are you from?
- Madrid.

412
00:45:55,414 --> 00:45:58,126
Madrid?
How did you get here?

413
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:00,034
It's a long story.

414
00:46:00,128 --> 00:46:03,213
I met a guy from LA at the
hotel where I worked...

415
00:46:03,297 --> 00:46:06,800
...who told me I could live with him
and that he could get me an agent.

416
00:46:06,885 --> 00:46:09,554
But he never realized that
I have a Spanish accent.

417
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:14,507
I like your accent.
You speak very well.

418
00:46:15,768 --> 00:46:20,815
- How did you learn English? - My mom had
an American boyfriend when I was little.

419
00:46:20,898 --> 00:46:23,056
Is your mother in Madrid?

420
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:25,612
Yes, she is.
She cuts hair.

421
00:46:25,695 --> 00:46:29,032
She cut my hair before I left.
Do you like it?

422
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:34,202
- I thought it made me look like James Dean.
- You are better than James Dean.

423
00:46:34,286 --> 00:46:35,746
Really?

424
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:37,403
Thanks.

425
00:46:41,585 --> 00:46:44,452
No one has ever picked me up
and not wanted something.

426
00:46:44,545 --> 00:46:46,204
I think you picked me up.

427
00:46:48,257 --> 00:46:50,052
This is kind of a serious day for me.

428
00:46:51,094 --> 00:46:54,514
Come on. What could be
so serious for a guy like you?

429
00:46:55,891 --> 00:46:59,967
I'm just trying to get over
an old love I guess.

430
00:47:01,646 --> 00:47:05,067
My mother says that
lovers are like buses.

431
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,902
You just have to wait a little while
and another one comes along.

432
00:47:14,576 --> 00:47:16,317
I have to go.

433
00:47:17,695 --> 00:47:18,918
You're a nice guy.

434
00:47:19,251 --> 00:47:20,903
I hope you find...

435
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:22,853
...someone like you.

436
00:47:22,876 --> 00:47:24,701
Thanks.

437
00:47:24,795 --> 00:47:27,202
I'm going away.

438
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:26,771
It's your turn to change it.

439
00:48:26,855 --> 00:48:29,481
Yeah, I'm not changing it.
It's your turn.

440
00:48:29,565 --> 00:48:31,974
Besides, you never like
what I put on anyway.

441
00:48:32,068 --> 00:48:34,987
I'll give you five dollars if you
change it. I'm too old to get up.

442
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,063
You're only old when it's
convenient for you to be old.

443
00:48:37,157 --> 00:48:39,909
What are you reading anyway?

444
00:48:39,992 --> 00:48:42,400
Oh God. Not that depressing crap again.

445
00:48:42,494 --> 00:48:44,121
It's for my class.

446
00:48:45,664 --> 00:48:47,791
What highbrow work of fiction
might you be reading?

447
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:52,672
Don't be so smug.

448
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,927
Man, what a life he has.

449
00:48:59,054 --> 00:49:01,097
- Don't you just envy him?
- Why?

450
00:49:01,181 --> 00:49:03,224
Because he can sniff
anyone's arse he wants?

451
00:49:04,684 --> 00:49:06,509
Nice.

452
00:49:06,603 --> 00:49:10,554
No, because he just does what he wants.
Like yesterday...

453
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:13,650
...I was standing in the front yard
and Susan came over to talk.

454
00:49:13,735 --> 00:49:16,195
And that little brat of hers
Christopher came...

455
00:49:16,231 --> 00:49:18,396
...running over waving that
damned gun of his around.

456
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:22,617
And our little dog walked
right up, hiked his leg...

457
00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:25,244
...and peed all over Christopher's
new tennis shoes.

458
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,956
All over Christopher actually.

459
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:30,532
And of course, I had
to act like I was upset

460
00:49:30,626 --> 00:49:33,659
It was so perfectly executed
you should have seen it.

461
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:36,538
After all the times those kids
have tortured that poor dog.

462
00:49:37,882 --> 00:49:40,094
I mean, you should take a
lesson from him. They don't...

463
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,846
They don't stay up all night worrying.

464
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:46,630
They figured out how to get the two
of us to do exactly what they want.

465
00:49:46,724 --> 00:49:51,476
They are basically very sophisticated
little parasites when you think about it.

466
00:49:51,512 --> 00:49:55,317
Well, the dumbest creatures are the
happiest. Just look at your mother.

467
00:49:58,403 --> 00:50:00,447
He's really just living the moment.

468
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,242
It's like now.

469
00:50:04,326 --> 00:50:06,954
What could be better than
being tucked up here with you?

470
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:14,335
If I died right now it would be OK.

471
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,550
Well, it wouldn't be OK with me so why don't
you shut up and go change the record.

472
00:50:23,427 --> 00:50:25,637
Good answer.

473
00:50:26,496 --> 00:50:27,896
You know what? I was thinking
about taking them up...

474
00:50:27,932 --> 00:50:30,893
...to Denver with me next week
if it's okay with you.

475
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:32,510
It's my mom.
She loves them.

476
00:50:32,603 --> 00:50:36,023
Probably that recognition
of a similar mind.

477
00:50:39,527 --> 00:50:41,487
You stay there, old man.

478
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:31,036
No, I did not forget the gin.
I'll see you in ten minutes.

479
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,175
Christopher, would you
like it if I killed you?

480
00:55:18,211 --> 00:55:19,353
I don't know.

481
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:21,971
If you keep this up
we're going to find out.

482
00:55:22,054 --> 00:55:25,141
So, why don't you go home
and stop shooting people?

483
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,880
I'm so happy to see you.

484
00:56:03,177 --> 00:56:04,751
Come on in.

485
00:56:07,514 --> 00:56:10,351
It smells wonderful.
I'm very hungry. Where is Lois?

486
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:13,103
I gave her the night off.
I'm cooking myself.

487
00:56:13,188 --> 00:56:15,346
- You are?
- Yes, I'm trying something new.

488
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,275
- Charley darling, ''you cooking' is new.
- Don't be smart.

489
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,195
I'm in a good mood tonight.
I'm going to be fun.

490
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:23,947
I've already made two
New Year's resolutions.

491
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:27,387
Resolution one: No more talk
that of awful ex-husbands...

492
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,329
..and children who don't give a damn.

493
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:30,695
- And the other one?
- One what?

494
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:32,498
Resolution.

495
00:56:32,581 --> 00:56:37,460
Resolution two: More smoking and more
drinking and screw it all! So come on...

496
00:56:37,543 --> 00:56:39,003
...mix me up a drink.

497
00:56:39,088 --> 00:56:41,079
I'll have a gin and tonic, please.

498
00:56:41,172 --> 00:56:43,300
- And watch out baby!
- Coming up.

499
00:56:48,137 --> 00:56:52,351
- It was sweet of you to come tonight.
- Sweet had nothing to do with it.

500
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:57,438
- I needed to see you.
- Come off it.

501
00:56:57,523 --> 00:57:00,806
Whenever you do something sweet
you're too ashamed to admit it.

502
00:57:02,277 --> 00:57:05,030
Here is to our early
New Year's resolutions.

503
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,065
Cheers.

504
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:12,485
What are your resolutions by the way?

505
00:57:14,123 --> 00:57:19,034
To let go of the past completely,
entirely, and forever.

506
00:57:21,255 --> 00:57:22,880
Light me up, will you?

507
00:57:31,054 --> 00:57:33,838
Darling, you dont look well.

508
00:57:33,932 --> 00:57:36,711
Do you remember that little
heart attack you had last year?

509
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:39,063
- It wasnt a heart attack.
- Well whatever it was darling...

510
00:57:39,146 --> 00:57:40,971
...you dont look so hot.

511
00:57:41,065 --> 00:57:44,349
Im fine.
I never felt better.

512
00:57:44,443 --> 00:57:48,394
- I'm a little tired. I haven't
been sleeping... - Geo, it's normal.

513
00:57:48,489 --> 00:57:50,396
You were with Jim for 16 years.

514
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:53,202
I think about Richard every day.

515
00:57:53,286 --> 00:57:55,027
Its hard being alone.

516
00:57:56,496 --> 00:57:59,583
At least you have a job and a life.

517
00:58:00,876 --> 00:58:03,284
Lets have a bit of dinner shall we?

518
00:58:03,378 --> 00:58:07,789
Because Ive worked so very hard.

519
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:12,346
- What are you talking about? - Seriously,
there no such thing as old anymore.

520
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:16,434
The other day one of my students
has called me a senior citizen.

521
00:58:16,516 --> 00:58:18,425
I wouldn't mind if old didn't exist...

522
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,512
...but I'm not sure senior is
what I'm aiming for either.

523
00:58:21,606 --> 00:58:24,148
It's all becoming so bland.
It's not why I came to America.

524
00:58:24,231 --> 00:58:26,525
It's like a complete breakdown
of culture and manners.

525
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,320
The young ones have no manners.

526
00:58:29,403 --> 00:58:33,481
The other day at the car wash
a young man looked me up and down...

527
00:58:33,574 --> 00:58:35,952
...and actually asked me if I
was a natural blonde.

528
00:58:36,036 --> 00:58:38,027
- What did you say?
- I looked him straight in the eye...

529
00:58:38,121 --> 00:58:41,822
...and said: ''Let's just say
if I stood on my head...

530
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:43,626
...I would be a natural
brunette with lovely breath.

531
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:45,753
- You didn't!
- I did!

532
00:58:47,713 --> 00:58:52,541
And the amusing thing was
that it went right over his head!

533
00:58:52,635 --> 00:58:55,128
You know, you had a mouth on you
even back in London.

534
00:58:55,222 --> 00:58:57,849
Do you remember that old lesbian
who threw her drink over your head...

535
00:58:57,932 --> 00:59:00,643
...because you asked her if
she was hung like a donut.

536
00:59:10,987 --> 00:59:12,614
Geo.

537
00:59:12,697 --> 00:59:15,188
We could always go back to London.
The two of us.

538
00:59:15,282 --> 00:59:18,869
- No, thanks.
- You know you miss it.

539
00:59:18,952 --> 00:59:19,900
I miss it sometimes.

540
00:59:21,288 --> 00:59:23,362
Maybe if Jim had lived.

541
00:59:23,456 --> 00:59:26,376
He loved being in England. He asked us
to stay the last time we were there.

542
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,952
Do you really think you
would have moved?

543
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,800
I don't know. It's silly to even talk
about it. It was only a fantasy.

544
00:59:42,141 --> 00:59:43,884
What's this?

545
00:59:43,978 --> 00:59:46,105
It's my mother's wedding ring.

546
00:59:46,981 --> 00:59:49,306
I found it a drawer
when I was cleaning out.

547
00:59:56,282 --> 00:59:59,034
Charley my dear, you and I are
both in need of another drink.

548
01:01:30,873 --> 01:01:32,833
Wait!
Wait, wait!

549
01:01:42,385 --> 01:01:44,376
I love this!

550
01:01:44,471 --> 01:01:46,847
- You're insane!
- Come on, old man!

551
01:03:06,592 --> 01:03:08,166
Don't move.

552
01:03:16,769 --> 01:03:18,344
Thank you.

553
01:03:28,114 --> 01:03:32,242
- Very smooth cigarette move.
- I've always wanted to do that.

554
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:35,193
You don't even smoke.

555
01:03:35,288 --> 01:03:37,831
Well, not for the last
sixteen years. Jim hated it.

556
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,701
What's to stop me now?
It's not as if he's gonna to kill me.

557
01:03:48,009 --> 01:03:51,677
This is so nice, lying here with you.

558
01:03:53,764 --> 01:03:55,449
Don't you ever miss this?

559
01:03:56,452 --> 01:03:58,693
What we could have been to each other?

560
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:02,106
Having a real relationship and kids?

561
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,780
- I had Jim.
- I know, but I mean a real relationship.

562
01:04:10,715 --> 01:04:14,827
Geo, let's be honest, what you and Jim
had together was wonderful but...

563
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,956
...wasn't it really just a
substitute for something else?

564
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:25,045
Is that really what you think
after all of these years?

565
01:04:27,213 --> 01:04:31,625
You think Jim was just some
kind of substitute for real love?

566
01:04:35,431 --> 01:04:38,965
Jim was not a substitute for anything.

567
01:04:40,101 --> 01:04:41,561
Do you understand?

568
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,739
There is no substitute for Jim...

569
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,637
...anywhere!

570
01:04:45,731 --> 01:04:48,532
And by the way, what is so real
about your relationship with Richard?

571
01:04:48,568 --> 01:04:51,518
He left you after nine years!

572
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:54,715
Jim and I were together
for sixteen years!

573
01:04:54,751 --> 01:04:57,065
And if he hadn't died we
would still be together!

574
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:58,702
What the hell is not real about that?

575
01:04:58,786 --> 01:05:01,329
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

576
01:05:01,414 --> 01:05:04,041
I know how much the two
of you loved each other.

577
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:08,702
I suppose I'm just jealous that
you and I never had that kind of love.

578
01:05:11,923 --> 01:05:15,010
Actually, I've never had that
kind of love with anybody.

579
01:05:16,804 --> 01:05:19,181
I don't think Richard ever loved me...

580
01:05:19,677 --> 01:05:20,748
...except for the way I looked.

581
01:05:21,728 --> 01:05:22,706
And Clay...

582
01:05:22,742 --> 01:05:24,961
I don't know. You raise
a child and love it...

583
01:05:24,998 --> 01:05:27,052
...and then when they are
old enough they just leave.

584
01:05:27,996 --> 01:05:29,831
Charley, there is nothing
wrong with your life.

585
01:05:29,947 --> 01:05:32,869
You just like feeling sorry for yourself.
It's one of your great pleasures.

586
01:05:32,907 --> 01:05:34,978
And it's not one of yours?

587
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:37,047
You're as pathetic as I am.

588
01:05:37,085 --> 01:05:40,043
Feeling sorry for myself is definitely
not one of my great pleasures.

589
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,291
Well, it's not one of mine either. I don't
like feeling sorry for myself one bit.

590
01:05:43,329 --> 01:05:45,112
I tried to hold onto
Richard for so long...

591
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:47,333
...even when it was obvious to
everyone but me that it was over.

592
01:05:47,416 --> 01:05:48,875
And now Clay is grown up.

593
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:51,420
I mean, what am I doing here Geo?
Tell me, what?

594
01:05:51,505 --> 01:05:53,829
You have plenty of friends.
You'll be fine.

595
01:05:53,923 --> 01:05:56,590
Yes, I have friends.
But none of them need me.

596
01:05:56,626 --> 01:06:00,231
And yes I have you and if you weren't such a
goddamn poof we could have all been happy!

597
01:06:06,894 --> 01:06:09,304
I only have you now
because you lost Jim.

598
01:06:09,396 --> 01:06:12,567
Soon I'll lose you to someone else.
It's not as easy for a woman.

599
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:14,481
I've done everything the way
I was supposed to and...

600
01:06:14,518 --> 01:06:16,737
...all I have to keep me
company is a bottle of gin.

601
01:06:16,822 --> 01:06:18,940
Maybe you should try
donuts with your gin.

602
01:06:20,407 --> 01:06:22,202
Screw you.

603
01:06:24,871 --> 01:06:27,655
Charlotte, you are dramatic.

604
01:06:27,748 --> 01:06:29,094
I swear you really almost had me.

605
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:33,088
A tiny tear was beginning to
form in the corner of my eye.

606
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:34,797
Now stop it.

607
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,882
You are still
breathtakingly beautiful.

608
01:06:39,175 --> 01:06:41,159
When you can be bothered
to get up and out of bed...

609
01:06:41,195 --> 01:06:44,266
...and you stop whimpering about
everything for five minutes.

610
01:06:44,974 --> 01:06:47,923
Go to London.
Change your life.

611
01:06:48,018 --> 01:06:50,478
If you're not happy being a woman
then stop acting like one.

612
01:06:50,563 --> 01:06:52,021
You have all the answers.

613
01:06:53,481 --> 01:06:55,775
No, I don't have any to mention.

614
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:58,726
If you're so smart why don't you
have something new in your life?

615
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,050
Take that position at Stanford.

616
01:07:00,088 --> 01:07:03,074
You complain about that little school
but you could go anywhere you want.

617
01:07:03,112 --> 01:07:05,567
I think what I've done
has been worthwhile.

618
01:07:05,661 --> 01:07:07,902
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

619
01:07:07,996 --> 01:07:10,155
I shouldn't have said that.

620
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:13,699
As much as I dread it, I think
I will go back to London.

621
01:07:13,793 --> 01:07:15,702
Why do you dread it?

622
01:07:15,795 --> 01:07:19,331
When I lived in London last I was
young. I was fresh, I was everything.

623
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:24,335
Coming to America was such a dream,
it was the icing on the cake.

624
01:07:24,429 --> 01:07:26,806
Going home is defeat.

625
01:07:26,891 --> 01:07:29,516
None of it really worked
out the way I'd planned.

626
01:07:29,601 --> 01:07:32,603
Most things don't work out
the way people plan.

627
01:07:34,606 --> 01:07:37,692
You're just living in the past. You need
to start thinking about your future.

628
01:07:37,775 --> 01:07:40,862
Living in the past is my future.

629
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:44,615
It doesn't have to be yours.
You're a man.

630
01:07:45,949 --> 01:07:48,192
And you're a bore tonight.

631
01:07:49,286 --> 01:07:52,570
Can't we just feel sorry for
ourselves a little bit longer?

632
01:07:52,664 --> 01:07:54,436
Let's have another drink.

633
01:07:54,472 --> 01:07:57,545
- I don't think so. I have to go. Come on.
Walk me out. - Please, please!

634
01:07:57,628 --> 01:08:00,128
- Come on, I have to!
- No, this was such fun! No.

635
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:11,007
When will I see you again?

636
01:08:13,311 --> 01:08:16,511
- Aren't you going to England?
- I'll never do that!

637
01:08:16,605 --> 01:08:18,565
It's far too much effort.

638
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:24,476
Besides, I don't think Jim would want me
to leave you here in LA all alone.

639
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:28,631
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.
I've got all the answers. Remember?

640
01:08:29,493 --> 01:08:31,369
What are you doing this weekend?

641
01:08:32,662 --> 01:08:35,289
I think I might just be very quiet.

642
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:40,628
You never really did take me
seriously, did you George?

643
01:08:40,712 --> 01:08:43,829
I tried to Charley. Remember?
A long time ago.

644
01:08:45,591 --> 01:08:47,551
It didn't really work out, did it?

645
01:08:49,845 --> 01:08:51,253
No, Charley.

646
01:08:58,313 --> 01:08:59,855
Sleep tight.

647
01:09:43,565 --> 01:09:47,153
Patrick, a beer and a
packet of Lucky Strike, please.

648
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,240
Excuse me.

649
01:10:48,462 --> 01:10:50,672
It's too hot in there.

650
01:10:50,756 --> 01:10:52,216
Yes, it is.

651
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,969
- Would you like a cigarette?
- No thanks, I don't smoke.

652
01:10:56,595 --> 01:11:00,516
- This place is really crowded.
- Well, it is Saturday night.

653
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:03,201
It's usually as bad as this.

654
01:11:03,237 --> 01:11:07,314
People normally just stop by and pick
someone up and then head on down the beach.

655
01:11:07,398 --> 01:11:09,389
Yeah. It's pretty wild out there.

656
01:11:09,483 --> 01:11:12,266
I'm surprised the cops
don't break it up.

657
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,904
- Is it always like that?
- Since the war ended.

658
01:11:15,988 --> 01:11:18,488
It's pretty great actually.
It's kind of pagan.

659
01:11:19,993 --> 01:11:22,121
- I'm Jim.
- I'm George.

660
01:11:22,203 --> 01:11:23,280
Pleased to meet you Jim.

661
01:11:23,318 --> 01:11:26,532
I'm sorry, I'm supposed to meet some
friends but I can't find them.

662
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:31,255
I just needed to get out of the house
but the lure of a cold beer got to me.

663
01:11:31,929 --> 01:11:33,154
Do you live hereby?

664
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:34,788
Canyon.

665
01:11:34,882 --> 01:11:37,042
- For how long?
- Since 38.

666
01:11:37,136 --> 01:11:39,293
- Where are you from?
- Colorado.

667
01:11:40,805 --> 01:11:44,039
I really like it here.
It's close to beach.

668
01:11:45,853 --> 01:11:48,177
I think I might stay after
I'm discharged.

669
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:51,931
I don't know, maybe
I'm a bit of a pagan.

670
01:11:56,454 --> 01:11:58,256
- After you.
- No.

671
01:12:04,703 --> 01:12:06,278
Sorry.

672
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:16,173
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

673
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,958
Do you buy me a drink?

674
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,628
I think I'm taken.

675
01:12:25,015 --> 01:12:28,050
Too bad, too bad.

676
01:12:30,604 --> 01:12:33,064
Do you want another beer?

677
01:13:29,412 --> 01:13:33,707
Patrick, a bottle of scotch and
a pack of Lucky Strikes to go, please?

678
01:13:43,551 --> 01:13:45,208
Patrick, cancel that.

679
01:13:56,939 --> 01:13:58,764
Well, hello Mr. Potter.

680
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:00,900
Hello, sir.

681
01:14:02,403 --> 01:14:04,895
- What are we drinking?
- Scotch.

682
01:14:05,738 --> 01:14:06,938
Okay.

683
01:14:13,372 --> 01:14:18,033
I come here all the time. I live just
around the corner, but then you knew that.

684
01:14:18,127 --> 01:14:19,920
On Camphor Tree Lane.

685
01:14:26,092 --> 01:14:28,052
You're still carrying that around.

686
01:14:30,096 --> 01:14:32,640
One must always appreciate
life's little gifts.

687
01:14:37,563 --> 01:14:38,898
So, what are you doing here?

688
01:14:39,689 --> 01:14:41,706
- Just out for a ride on my bike.
- Is that all?

689
01:14:42,943 --> 01:14:43,974
I don't know.

690
01:14:44,068 --> 01:14:45,725
Were you looking for me?

691
01:14:46,613 --> 01:14:48,604
Maybe. I don't know.

692
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:51,148
I feel like my head's
stopped up with stuff.

693
01:14:51,242 --> 01:14:52,430
What kind of stuff?

694
01:14:52,466 --> 01:14:54,918
Like, the stuff you were talking
about today in class.

695
01:14:54,954 --> 01:14:56,738
That is definitely not important.

696
01:14:56,831 --> 01:14:59,323
No, it is important.
Your class is great.

697
01:14:59,417 --> 01:15:03,962
But somehow we always seem
to get stuck talking about the past.

698
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:05,672
The past just doesn't matter to me.

699
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:09,594
- The present?
- I can't wait for the present to be over.

700
01:15:09,676 --> 01:15:11,668
It's a total drag.

701
01:15:12,512 --> 01:15:14,724
Well, tonight is the exception.

702
01:15:16,184 --> 01:15:18,091
What?

703
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:21,189
Tonight, yes!
The present, no!

704
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,315
Let's drink to tonight.

705
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:25,609
Tonight.

706
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:29,621
So if the past doesn't matter and
the present is a total drag.

707
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,564
What about the future?

708
01:15:31,658 --> 01:15:35,328
What future?
Cuba might just blow us up.

709
01:15:35,411 --> 01:15:37,042
Death is the future.

710
01:15:37,078 --> 01:15:38,970
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be depressing.

711
01:15:39,038 --> 01:15:41,275
It's not depressing.
It's not depressing, it's true.

712
01:15:41,311 --> 01:15:44,404
It may not be your immediate future
but it's what we all share.

713
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:46,578
Death is the future.

714
01:15:46,671 --> 01:15:48,747
You're right, I guess.

715
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,859
If one is not enjoying one's present
there isn't a great deal to...

716
01:15:51,896 --> 01:15:53,926
...suggest that the future
should be any better.

717
01:15:54,627 --> 01:15:56,448
Yeah, I've thought that before.

718
01:15:57,181 --> 01:16:00,466
But the thing is you just never know.

719
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:02,635
Look at tonight.

720
01:16:06,774 --> 01:16:08,484
Actually...

721
01:16:08,568 --> 01:16:11,060
...I feel really alone most of the time.

722
01:16:11,631 --> 01:16:13,313
- You do?
- Yeah.

723
01:16:14,323 --> 01:16:15,967
I've always felt this way.

724
01:16:16,003 --> 01:16:19,444
I mean we're born alone, we die alone.

725
01:16:19,537 --> 01:16:24,083
And while we're here we are absolutely,
completely sealed in our own bodies.

726
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:26,826
Really weird.

727
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:30,590
Kinda freaks me out to think about it.

728
01:16:30,673 --> 01:16:35,583
We can only experience the outside world
through our own slanted perception of it.

729
01:16:37,304 --> 01:16:39,462
Who knows what you're really like?

730
01:16:39,556 --> 01:16:43,935
- I just see what I think you're like.
- I'm exactly what I appear to be.

731
01:16:46,689 --> 01:16:49,065
If you look closely.

732
01:16:54,738 --> 01:16:58,356
You know the only thing that has made
the whole thing worthwhile...

733
01:16:59,409 --> 01:17:00,953
...has been those...

734
01:17:01,662 --> 01:17:05,988
...few times that I've been able to really,
truly connect with another human being.

735
01:17:09,337 --> 01:17:11,244
I had a hunch about you, sir.

736
01:17:11,637 --> 01:17:13,247
- You did?
- Yes, sir.

737
01:17:14,091 --> 01:17:16,844
I had a hunch you might
be a real romantic.

738
01:17:22,265 --> 01:17:25,134
You know, everyone
keeps telling you that...

739
01:17:25,226 --> 01:17:28,020
...when you're older, that you'll
have all this experience.

740
01:17:28,055 --> 01:17:29,797
Like it's some great thing.

741
01:17:29,833 --> 01:17:31,310
That's a load of shit.

742
01:17:31,868 --> 01:17:34,132
I think I've actually just
gotten sillier and sillier.

743
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:36,404
- Really?
- Absolutely.

744
01:17:36,488 --> 01:17:39,271
So, all your experience is useless.

745
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:42,608
No, I wouldn't say that.

746
01:17:43,453 --> 01:17:46,583
As our friend Mr. Huxley says:
Experience is not what happens to a man.

747
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:49,466
It is what a man does
with what happens to him.

748
01:17:51,293 --> 01:17:53,171
- Let's go swimming.
- Okay.

749
01:17:54,881 --> 01:17:57,425
- What?
- It was a test.

750
01:17:57,509 --> 01:18:00,261
I thought you were
bluffing about being silly so...

751
01:18:00,345 --> 01:18:05,256
...I said to myself I'll suggest doing
something completely outrageous.

752
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:09,729
And if he resists, if he even hesitates
then I know he's full of shit.

753
01:18:11,773 --> 01:18:13,680
Well, I wasn't.
Were you?

754
01:18:14,775 --> 01:18:16,403
Hell, no!

755
01:18:34,252 --> 01:18:36,462
Come on sir.
I'll help you down.

756
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,882
Let's go.

757
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,846
Come on, sir.

758
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:03,288
Sir?

759
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:05,551
Sir?

760
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:18,011
That's enough for now, sir.

761
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,358
- I'm fine.
- I'm cold. Come on.

762
01:20:34,829 --> 01:20:36,570
Can we go back to your place, sir?

763
01:20:36,664 --> 01:20:39,208
Of course.
Where else?

764
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:42,546
- Where else.
- Are you out of your mind?

765
01:20:42,628 --> 01:20:46,581
- What's the matter?
- You can't get home like that!

766
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,551
We're invisible, don't you know that?

767
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:53,179
You know sir, they ought not
to let you out on your own.

768
01:20:53,429 --> 01:20:55,340
You're liable to get into real trouble.

769
01:20:55,641 --> 01:20:57,884
I excel at it.

770
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:00,020
Your forehead is bleeding.

771
01:21:23,918 --> 01:21:27,590
The bathroom is just down the hall
if you would like to take a shower.

772
01:21:27,672 --> 01:21:30,050
Aren't you taking a shower too, sir?

773
01:21:30,134 --> 01:21:33,502
I'm fine. I'm English.
We like to be cold and wet.

774
01:21:33,595 --> 01:21:36,067
First, I think that we need
to take care of that cut, sir.

775
01:21:36,103 --> 01:21:37,617
Do you have any band-aids?

776
01:21:41,604 --> 01:21:44,833
- Going camping, sir?
- I'm fine, really.

777
01:21:46,274 --> 01:21:48,068
Stay there.
I'll be right back.

778
01:22:32,194 --> 01:22:33,853
Sit up.

779
01:22:35,364 --> 01:22:37,240
Tilt your head back.

780
01:23:02,099 --> 01:23:04,654
Well sir, I'm afraid this
time you don't have...

781
01:23:04,692 --> 01:23:07,497
...the excuse of mescaline
to explain your band-aid.

782
01:23:09,271 --> 01:23:11,942
I think we should get you
out of those wet clothes.

783
01:23:14,485 --> 01:23:15,976
Yes, sir.

784
01:24:49,078 --> 01:24:52,195
- You're not too cold?
- I'm great.

785
01:24:52,289 --> 01:24:55,158
- Would you like a drink?
- A beer, sir. If you have one.

786
01:24:55,251 --> 01:24:58,118
I'm afraid that's all we have.

787
01:24:58,212 --> 01:24:59,871
Two beers coming up.

788
01:25:14,186 --> 01:25:16,939
- You live here all by yourself, sir?
- I do now.

789
01:25:17,023 --> 01:25:19,974
I used to share this place with
a friend. He was an architect.

790
01:25:20,068 --> 01:25:23,958
Man, guys my age dream about the
kind of setup you've got here.

791
01:25:23,996 --> 01:25:26,783
I mean, what more can you want?

792
01:25:26,865 --> 01:25:30,400
You get to be left alone and
come and go as you please.

793
01:25:32,122 --> 01:25:33,905
Is that's your idea of the perfect life?

794
01:25:33,942 --> 01:25:35,993
What's the matter, sir?
Don't you believe me?

795
01:25:36,542 --> 01:25:38,652
If you're so keen on the
idea living by yourself...

796
01:25:38,689 --> 01:25:40,551
...where does Lois fit into this plan?

797
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:43,856
Lois? What's she got to
do with anything?

798
01:25:44,466 --> 01:25:46,545
I got the impression that you
and she were together.

799
01:25:49,805 --> 01:25:53,141
Not really.
She is kind of cool and...

800
01:25:53,859 --> 01:25:55,769
...we're good friends but...

801
01:25:57,813 --> 01:26:00,764
I think what you really want to
ask me is if we sleep together.

802
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:04,559
- And do you?
- We did. Once.

803
01:26:04,653 --> 01:26:08,948
- Why only once?
- I didn't say only once, I said once.

804
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:12,984
Come on, the last thing I want to
talk about right now is Lois.

805
01:26:13,078 --> 01:26:14,569
What time is it?

806
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:19,292
My watch seems to have stopped.

807
01:26:26,257 --> 01:26:27,832
Do you want me to go?

808
01:26:28,801 --> 01:26:31,377
You must be kidding.
Go, get us another beer.

809
01:26:32,971 --> 01:26:34,849
Is that an order, sir?

810
01:26:36,725 --> 01:26:37,832
You're damn right it is.

811
01:26:49,654 --> 01:26:51,364
Pathetic.

812
01:26:52,617 --> 01:26:54,659
Did you say something, sir?

813
01:26:59,081 --> 01:27:00,573
Why are you here?

814
01:27:02,752 --> 01:27:08,288
Why did you get to the office and
ask secretary for my address?

815
01:27:09,801 --> 01:27:14,197
I just wanted to see you
someplace other than school.

816
01:27:15,347 --> 01:27:17,088
Why?

817
01:27:20,228 --> 01:27:24,176
Sometimes I think I'm crazy cause I see
things so differently than everyone else.

818
01:27:25,471 --> 01:27:27,222
I feel like I can talk to you.

819
01:27:28,649 --> 01:27:31,695
To be honest sir, I was also
worried about you today.

820
01:27:36,659 --> 01:27:38,150
Me?

821
01:27:38,244 --> 01:27:41,029
What's to be worried about?

822
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:43,332
I'm fine.

823
01:27:52,384 --> 01:27:53,957
I'm...

824
01:27:55,177 --> 01:27:56,720
I'm fine.

825
01:30:40,573 --> 01:30:45,113
<i>A few times in my life I've had
moments of absolute clarity.

826
01:30:47,930 --> 01:30:50,067
<i>When for a few brief seconds...

827
01:30:50,934 --> 01:30:53,203
<i>...the silence drowns out the noise...

828
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:56,622
<i>...and I can feel rather than think.

829
01:30:57,481 --> 01:30:59,640
<i>And things seem so sharp...

830
01:31:00,609 --> 01:31:02,685
<i>And the world seems so fresh...

831
01:31:04,323 --> 01:31:07,574
<i>...as though it had all
just come into existence.

832
01:31:27,636 --> 01:31:29,792
<i>I can never make these moments last.

833
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:32,244
<i>I cling to them...

834
01:31:32,282 --> 01:31:34,456
<i>...but like everything they fade.

835
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,761
<i>I've lived my live on these moments.

836
01:31:40,231 --> 01:31:42,025
<i>They pull me back to the present...

837
01:31:44,235 --> 01:31:49,078
<i>...and I realize that everything is
exactly the way it was meant to be.

838
01:34:09,045 --> 01:34:12,418
<i>And just like that it came.
