1
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,949
- I never heard of him.
- Who?

2
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,521
The man you recommended.

3
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,056
The guitar fighter?

4
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:04,186
Wiped out a couple towns
single-handedly. A real nut. Yeah.

5
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:07,926
You heard of him. You just didn't know
it was him they were talking about.

6
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,228
You should meet him.

7
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,970
Me. Me. That's me.

8
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:20,138
As long as I'm not the guy
that has to make the introduction.

9
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:23,010
Were you in Mexico during
the Barillo cartel massacre?

10
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:25,084
No.

11
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:29,586
That's when I first heard about him.
He was a legend.

12
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,885
They used to say he was the biggest
Mexican they'd ever seen.

13
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,827
That was total bullshit.
He was 5'9", 5'10", tops.

14
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,728
That's no record,
but bigger than most of us.

15
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:45,235
But Marquez, that's a different story.

16
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,271
<i>Marquez.</i>

17
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:51,309
<i>Marquez.</i>
<i>Gen. Marquez.</i>

18
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,675
<i>Powerful, dangerous.</i>

19
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,877
<i>Marquez, he really had it in</i>
<i>for this Mariachi, see.</i>

20
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:13,260
<i>They called him "Mariachi"</i>
<i>because he used to carry this guitar.</i>

21
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:15,865
A guitar?

22
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,937
Believe me, he really knew
how to play it too.

23
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,933
Look, this story is well-traveled.

24
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:51,104
It might have picked up some
embellishments along the way.

25
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54,207
Just read between the lines.

26
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,372
<i>Now, he may not have been</i>
<i>the biggest Mexican ever...</i>

27
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,413
- All right.
...but she was as deadly...

28
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,880
...as she was beautiful.

29
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:41,750
- There's a girl?
- Oh, yeah. There's a girl.

30
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:45,380
When he'd run out of ammo,
she'd take over.

31
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:51,120
The most drop-dead gorgeous
woman you'll ever see.

32
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,503
That's where all the trouble began.
She was with Marquez.

33
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:43,514
And when Marquez saw that she was
with the Mariachi, well, he went crazy.

34
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:48,451
He hunted him down and fought
Mariachi to the death. And then she...

35
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,392
...put a bullet in his heart.

36
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,531
Only he didn't die.

37
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:06,536
- I don't know what happened after that.
- Would you like some?

38
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:10,643
No. Maybe Marquez caught up
with them, or the cartels.

39
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:14,837
But like I said, the man
is a myth, a legend.

40
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:18,746
And if he's still living,
he's the one you want.

41
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,783
Well...

42
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,581
...that is truly unbelievable.

43
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,886
Well, I'm not big on telling stories.

44
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,496
Where's the money?
That's the reason I'm here.

45
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,656
I couldn't find a briefcase
small enough...

46
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:37,099
...for $ 10,000 in cash.

47
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,643
It'll do.

48
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:49,112
Just for my own edification,
I offered you 50.

49
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:52,309
- Why'd you say no?
- I'm not a greedy man.

50
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,784
Not looking to get rich quick.

51
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:59,983
Besides, 50,000 is a lot for what
you wanted me to find out, you know.

52
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,187
You may as just as well put a bullet
in my head as cough it up, right?

53
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,295
But 10?

54
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,129
Ten thousand is civilized.

55
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,737
Ten is something
we both can live with.

56
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:19,005
Ten might still be too much.

57
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,941
You'd kill me over $ 10,000?

58
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,017
You wouldn't dare.

59
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,853
You wouldn't dare.

60
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,819
Yes, I would.

61
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:55,564
Would you do me the honor?

62
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,572
You need to learn to play.

63
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,408
That's why you're here.

64
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,672
I hear this is a town of Gunmen.

65
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,670
We only make guitars here.

66
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,919
Mariachi.

67
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,846
Which one?

68
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,264
I don't know who you mean.

69
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:10,686
I'm honored to be in your presence.

70
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,329
But there's someone else who
wants to meet you.

71
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:24,141
Keep it. He made that for you.

72
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,936
You know, if I was you, son,
I'd turn around and go back right now.

73
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,199
Go back to where I came from...

74
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:59,606
...instead of selling my mind
and my soul to these cocksuckers.

75
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,642
You speak English?

76
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,311
I didn't think so.

77
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:11,123
Attempts have been made on me
and my family by the cartels.

78
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,822
The same cartels that are
threatening our freedom...

79
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,664
freedom which we must
defend to the death.

80
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,049
I present to you Señor Blascoe.

81
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,738
Please sit.

82
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,581
We hear you want to work for us.

83
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,752
I too am ready to start a new life.

84
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,395
This is your lucky day.

85
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,036
Did you order my <i>pibil</i>?

86
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,247
- Does it have a name?
- They call him "EI."

87
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,616
As in "The."

88
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,844
I know what it means. Thank you.

89
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,714
Alert the Barillo cartel...

90
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:55,055
...that El has come out of hiding.

91
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,095
- I don't think we should...
- Are you a Mexican...

92
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,699
...or a Mexi-can't?

93
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,195
I'm a Mexican.

94
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,168
Good.

95
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:10,275
Then do as I say.

96
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:22,418
- Nice tune.
- Something my brother taught me.

97
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,181
I killed him.

98
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:29,294
Yes, I was privy to that
information already. How charming.

99
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,761
You know, EI,
if I may call you that...

100
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:37,734
...I've been doing a little snooping
around, and it seems that the cartels...

101
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,963
...have quite a price on your head.

102
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,437
I wouldn't want to be you.

103
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,511
Tell me, is there anyone
who doesn't want you dead?

104
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,707
You tell me.

105
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,216
I need you to kill a man.

106
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:59,221
EI, you really must try this
because it's <i>puerco pibil.</i>

107
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:03,260
It's a slow-roasted pork, nothing fancy.
It just happens to be my favorite...

108
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,868
...and I order it with a tequila and lime
in every dive I go to in this country.

109
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:14,132
And honestly, that is the best
it's ever been anywhere.

110
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,468
In fact, it's too good.

111
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,874
It's so good that when I'm finished,
I'll pay my check...

112
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,844
...walk straight into the kitchen
and shoot the cook.

113
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,584
Because that's what I do.
I restore the balance to this country.

114
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,187
And that is what I would like
from you right now.

115
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,620
Help keep the balance
by pulling the trigger.

116
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,658
- You want me to shoot the cook?
- No, I'll shoot the cook.

117
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,127
My car's parked
out back anyway. You...

118
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,123
...will kill Marquez.

119
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,303
Do you remember Gen. Marquez?

120
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,706
He's being paid by Barillo...

121
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,571
...to kill the president
in an attempted coup d'état.

122
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:55,572
- Attempted?
- Oh, no. The president will be killed...

123
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:59,515
...because he's that piece of good pork
that needs to get balanced out.

124
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,144
I say "attempted" because we don't
want Marquez taking power.

125
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:06,486
I need you to put the hurting,
so to speak, on Marquez...

126
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,822
...after he's killed
the president. Savvy?

127
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:13,830
- So why me?
- You've got nothing to live for...

128
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,332
...and, in a way, you're already dead.

129
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,505
And Marquez is the man
who killed you.

130
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,664
So why not return the favor?
Go to the church.

131
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,004
Meet with an associate
of mine named Salome at 3:00.

132
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:31,041
And I will contact you afterwards
if we have a deal.

133
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,026
Was I right?

134
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,323
I guess not.

135
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,241
The last shipment of guns
that were seized at our border...

136
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,614
...have not been
accounted for, Sanchez.

137
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:13,452
You are now off that assignment.
Who wants to volunteer?

138
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:17,785
Okay. You, Gomez, it's yours.

139
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:21,195
With <i>el presidente's</i> new campaign
against the Barillo cartel...

140
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,598
...their activities are being
pushed into the forefront.

141
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:29,537
Large payments, deliveries,
whispers of a political takeover.

142
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:33,236
I need new point men,
strong and willing.

143
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:38,544
This is a top priority of <i>el presidente.</i>
Who wants this?

144
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,647
Romero, it's yours.

145
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,415
Pick your secondary person.
A third, if you have to.

146
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,025
That's all. Dismissed.

147
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,189
I should take his left nut.

148
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,099
You're with us.

149
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,596
People of Culiacan.

150
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:05,877
I've come here to bring you a
message of peace.

151
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:09,843
Peace that at this moment is being
threatened by a group of people

152
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,007
that is threatening our nation.

153
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,413
People like Armando Barillo.

154
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,120
I invite you to gather our forces...

155
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,020
...in order to prevent the
destruction of our unity

156
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,885
...and our peace.

157
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:28,995
<i>El presidente</i>, history teaches us
no matter how great your armies are...

158
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:32,171
...you will always need
the favor of the inhabitants...

159
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,273
...to take possession of a province.

160
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,706
How can you compete with
a man like Barillo? He owns Culiacan.

161
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,505
He doesn't own its people.

162
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,240
Barillo purchased hundreds
of homes and ranches...

163
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,509
...in the northern part of Culiacan.

164
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,382
And then he has turned around
and given these homes to the people.

165
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,620
- He's a folk hero to them.
- He's also a mass murderer...

166
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,761
...and a drug kingpin.

167
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:59,888
He's trying to make himself a martyr
by drawing the people to his side...

168
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,261
...but the people can see through that.

169
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:06,900
Men like Barillo have stolen
this country's soul.

170
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:10,473
But my people will stand up
for what is right.

171
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:14,170
I'm afraid they're no longer
your people, sir.

172
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,207
Then I will die fighting.

173
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,819
Are you with me?

174
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,784
To the death.

175
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,963
What's wrong?

176
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,370
Everything.

177
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,706
This way!

178
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,646
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

179
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:03,747
Any suggestions, Miss "Let's
get a room on the fifth floor...

180
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,982
...so we can see
the beautiful sunset"?

181
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:12,194
Jump.

182
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,434
Swing, swing, swing.

183
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,643
- Hang on!
- What do you mean, hold on?

184
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,483
Let go now!

185
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:13,250
Give me that!

186
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,591
Stop the bus.

187
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:16,820
Stop the bus.

188
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:23,926
A vow must be broken.

189
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,493
Forgive me...

190
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,894
for what I am about to become.

191
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,805
- When was your last confession?
- An hour ago.

192
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,739
- And the name of your priest?
- Sands.

193
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:43,575
Okay. You are expected to carry out
your assignment to the letter...

194
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,512
- Yeah, I know.
- Failure to appear...

195
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,845
...in locations at assigned times...

196
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,457
...results in forfeit of protection,
protection you will definitely need.

197
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,354
- Yeah.
- You'll be paid.

198
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:57,753
Coup d'états, like elections,
don't come cheap.

199
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,161
So there's plenty of dough
floating around.

200
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:04,502
There's more.
You will be a free man...

201
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,606
...from Marquez, the cartels,
and even from the president...

202
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:11,743
...who isn't your biggest fan,
let's face it.

203
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:15,436
- When do I begin?
- Give me a moment.

204
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:57,522
It's a church, <i>hombre.</i>

205
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,185
I'm sorry.

206
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,806
Are you still standing?

207
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,740
Still.

208
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:05,111
<i>Good. Well, the Barillo cartel</i>
<i>aren't the nicest of guys, are they?</i>

209
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:08,518
However, you've passed the test.

210
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,622
You're gonna do just fine.

211
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:15,159
Assemble your team, and I will
call you with further instructions.

212
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,927
<i>Over and out.</i>

213
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:26,395
I'm just walking my beat, friend.
Mexico's my beat, I'm walking it.

214
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:30,507
I throw shapes, and they catch them.
I set them up and watch them fall.

215
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:34,810
Have him meet me
at the bullfight at 5 p.m. What?

216
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,642
Why would I want that?
Why would I want bubble gum?

217
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,350
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

218
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:49,927
Okay, this should hold the both
of us over for quite a long time.

219
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:53,827
So I don't ever want to see you again.

220
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,933
Fuck off.

221
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,512
- Hi.
- Hello.

222
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:13,777
The CIA sharing a meal with the FBI.

223
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:18,185
Now, if that isn't interagency
cooperation, I just don't know what is.

224
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:20,917
- I'm retired FBI.
- A real agent never retires.

225
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,618
He just takes it a little easier.

226
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:29,262
- Why are we talking?
- You tracked down Armando Barillo...

227
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:32,835
...for two years when he was running
operations out of San Antonio.

228
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:35,496
Spinning wheels.
It never led to an arrest.

229
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:38,871
Well, he...

230
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:43,708
He is, in fact,
sitting directly behind you.

231
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:45,214
I know.

232
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,410
He settled back in.
He's been living here for six years.

233
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,418
Can't be touched.

234
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:53,922
Did you know that most agents
never even see a top-10 criminal...

235
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:57,995
...for their entire careers?
You brought down two, didn't you?

236
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:02,066
And now your third
is sitting in very close proximity.

237
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:04,896
Now, retired or not...

238
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:09,700
...that has really got to tug
on the old short and curlies.

239
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:12,139
I'm a civilian now.

240
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,743
Didn't he kill that agent friend
of yours? What was his name...

241
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:18,008
...Archuleta?

242
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,117
Yes.

243
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:25,647
Barillo is a Mexican citizen.

244
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,817
He cannot be extradited for crimes
committed in the U.S.

245
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,361
Do you happen to know of a
Dr. Guevera? Worked for the cartel.

246
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:38,299
This doctor pumped your friend
Archuleta full of drugs, day after day...

247
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:43,032
...so that they could torture him
for two weeks before he died.

248
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,002
You must have known that.

249
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:51,946
Dr. Guevera himself
having dinner with your prey.

250
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,677
I wonder what it is they're up to now.

251
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:59,550
Two weeks of torture, Jorge.
Think about that.

252
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,589
For your dead friend...

253
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:04,489
...for the job you didn't finish
in San Antonio.

254
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:08,326
Now, are you really going to let it
slip away again?

255
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:18,000
I'd like you to have a bite
of my pork because it's...

256
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:20,469
...the world.

257
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:22,665
(Announcer)
It's Mariachi Happy Hour!

258
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,365
Get your Mariachi song for 5 pesos.

259
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,406
A Mariachi kiss for 20 pesos.

260
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:29,113
And a Mariachi fuck for only 50 pesos!

261
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,182
Where the hell have you been?

262
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,015
Far away.

263
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:38,921
Still fucking around?

264
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,753
Let me get Fideo.

265
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,361
I'm here for my guitar.

266
00:32:54,907 --> 00:32:57,034
It's his last night.

267
00:32:58,277 --> 00:32:59,972
They're firing him.

268
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,571
Hey...

269
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:05,576
...Fideo, it's me.

270
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:10,186
- Still drinking.
- Like a fish.

271
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:13,325
I guess we haven't changed so much.

272
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:20,729
I didn't think you'd ever
come back for this thing.

273
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:23,333
Neither did I.

274
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,732
Are we on?

275
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:29,063
I'll let you know.
I'll let you know.

276
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:37,015
Bring him sober.
We're gonna need him, so...

277
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,444
...coffee.

278
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,585
Lots of coffee.

279
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:45,914
Sometimes a revolution is exactly
what's needed to clean up the system.

280
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:47,251
One...

281
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:51,959
...giant enema, which just so happens
to be my area of expertise.

282
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:57,059
Bullfights. Bull hockey.
Do you like this?

283
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:01,537
The bull is stabbed,
prodded, beaten.

284
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,303
The bull is wounded.
The bull is tired before the matador...

285
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:11,575
...ever steps into the ring.
Now, is that victory?

286
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,750
Of course it is.

287
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,680
Wanna know
the secret to winning?

288
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,879
Creative sportsmanship.

289
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,820
In other words...

290
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,756
...one has to rig the game.

291
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:32,561
Go collect.

292
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:47,574
<i>El presidente</i> is giving a speech
on the Day of the Dead...

293
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,277
...in the town of Culiacan.

294
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:50,922
He's going to be isolated...

295
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,787
...in the main <i>edificio</i>
in the center of the plaza.

296
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,052
Very easy access to him if...

297
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,527
...somebody can get you in.

298
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:02,694
Right.
You're the man who can do that.

299
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,836
I am not the prince.

300
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:08,598
I am the man behind the prince.

301
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,571
- I see.
- He's not the first prince I've served...

302
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:14,303
...nor the first one that I've betrayed.

303
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:18,512
- You're a good rat. I like you.
- I try.

304
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:22,183
The rest upon completion.

305
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:25,619
- <i>Mucho gusto.</i>
- Right. Right.

306
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,756
Every goddamn time.

307
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,534
What do you want in life?

308
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,472
Belini...

309
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:30,342
...how long have you and I
done business together?

310
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,415
A long time.

311
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,518
And in a way...

312
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:39,248
...I kind of, almost, could have the
tiniest smidgen of respect for you.

313
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,119
Almost.

314
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:43,488
But you need to stop farting around.

315
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:47,189
Now, do you have the information
that I need on Barillo or do you not?

316
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,596
I have what you need.

317
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:53,737
I'm just enjoying this
temporary position of power.

318
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,531
That make you nervous?

319
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:59,108
You know that withholding vital
information from a federal officer...

320
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:00,869
...is a serious offense.

321
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,947
Especially when that officer has paid
handsomely for it...

322
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:08,746
...and wouldn't think twice about
ripping that patch off your eyehole...

323
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,286
...and skull-fucking you to death.

324
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,118
No.

325
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,128
I'm fine. Go away.

326
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,993
I am fine. Go away.
You're off the hook.

327
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:27,762
Leave me alone.

328
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:31,104
That spill just cost you your life.

329
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,661
A little help.

330
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,373
Okay.

331
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,279
I know it's on you somewhere.

332
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,008
Somewhere.

333
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,486
All right.

334
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,758
Time to get messy.

335
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:44,778
Well, I suppose I should thank you
for not sticking it up your ass.

336
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,180
However.

337
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,498
You're about a quart low.

338
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:20,747
You're gonna pay for that, cop.

339
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,945
- Why doesn't my key work anymore?
- It's too small.

340
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:30,320
- Stand back.
- I just... I brought you a gift.

341
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:31,792
I'm still mad at you.

342
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:35,228
And trust me,
it wasn't easy to get. So...

343
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:38,396
Come closer and I'll thank you.

344
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:44,842
- Are you trying to give me a boner?
- Closer, I said.

345
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,106
How about that little tip-off?

346
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:51,648
Guarantees you a big arrest
and an accommodation.

347
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:53,785
Even from your twisted little agency.

348
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,943
I'm impressed.

349
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,180
- But then what?
- Want to hear my plan?

350
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:00,950
Either that or I start target practice.

351
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:07,395
Okay. The new president is on a
quest to clear out the Barillo cartel.

352
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,660
And Barillo has set up
a counterattack...

353
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:14,270
...by hiring a military general
named Marquez.

354
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,999
<i>He wants him</i>
<i>to throw a coup d'état...</i>

355
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:20,372
<i>... while the president's</i>
<i>visiting Culiacan.</i>

356
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:23,605
<i>Now, I have a man inside</i>
<i>as insurance...</i>

357
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,216
...<i>to make sure that Marquez</i>
<i>never takes power.</i>

358
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:29,012
The last piece of the puzzle...

359
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,886
...is Barillo. Your tip-off assures...

360
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:37,987
...<i>that Barillo is out of the picture</i>
<i>while the battle ensues.</i>

361
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:42,463
<i>In the aftermath</i>
<i>of this very healthy revolution...</i>

362
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:47,764
...<i>I will calmly waltz away with</i>
<i>the 20 million pesos...</i>

363
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:51,409
...<i>that Barillo is prepared to pay</i>
<i>Marquez for the coup.</i>

364
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:54,101
- You want me to go with you?
- You detain Barillo...

365
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:57,578
...with the information that you have,
then you join me...

366
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:59,683
...and share the spoils.

367
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:06,287
You meet me two nights from now...

368
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:08,892
...at La Pileta, 10 p.m. Sharp...

369
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,291
...and bring only
what's important to you.

370
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,694
Oh, yeah.

371
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:20,495
It might get a wee bit dangerous
there, sugar-butt. So...

372
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:24,132
- Can you dig it?
- I can dig it.

373
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:26,637
I want my key back.

374
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:38,946
Testing. One, two. Testing.

375
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:18,926
Hello?

376
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,928
Can you hear me now?

377
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:24,095
Okay... Fucking bells.

378
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:26,604
Did you assemble your team?

379
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,568
You know I did.

380
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:33,010
- Why are you having me followed?
- <i>Oh, yeah, that. Let's just call that a...</i>

381
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,305
...guarantee of compliance, shall we?

382
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,243
Because Cucuy also...

383
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:40,316
- <i>... provides protection.</i>
- From what? Mosquitoes?

384
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:43,420
<i>Oh, gosh, I really wouldn't mess</i>
<i>with him if I were you...</i>

385
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:45,453
...because he's a bit of a live wire.

386
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:48,684
<i>And he's not the happiest</i>
<i>that you killed his man.</i>

387
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,127
<i>Oh, yeah, by the way,</i>
<i>I have your next assignment.</i>

388
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,332
You the Mariachis?

389
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:23,150
This is the back entrance.
Make a note of it.

390
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,869
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

391
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:41,345
Who are they?

392
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:43,046
Musicians.

393
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:51,355
Why so heavy?

394
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:55,186
Built in amplifier.

395
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,256
Play something.

396
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:01,925
All right.

397
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,175
Let's go.

398
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:26,118
- I was afraid you couldn't play.
- Are you kidding?

399
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,171
What we are looking for is support

400
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,036
from the people of this state.

401
00:46:19,511 --> 00:46:21,809
A man can do a lot alone,

402
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:26,308
but he can do better with his
people backing him.

403
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:30,080
I wonder how much
we're getting paid for this shit.

404
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:36,186
A man who wants nothing
is invincible, <i>cabrón</i>.

405
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:47,732
Hey.

406
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:51,375
Are you gonna tell him
that this is his last meal?

407
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:59,409
Is there a particular song you
would like to hear?

408
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:22,037
We just played for <i>el presidente</i>,
I can't buy half a tequila with this shit!

409
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:24,731
It was meant as an honor.

410
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:26,703
Fuck honor.

411
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:30,173
- We need money.
- The score's tomorrow. Enough for all.

412
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:32,680
Even for you, Lorenzo.

413
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:36,412
Why are you suddenly interested
in the score? What's in it for you?

414
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:38,419
Only revenge.

415
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:41,690
Much delayed revenge.

416
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:48,993
Go practice.

417
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:51,391
Practice?

418
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:55,164
Playing or shooting?

419
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,931
What do you think?

420
00:47:57,609 --> 00:47:59,474
I don't think. I drink.

421
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:10,247
- Yeah, hello.
- Been following Barillo...

422
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:15,085
...and the good Dr. Guevera.
- Oh, Agent Ramirez, no longer retired.

423
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,094
- Good man. Welcome to the fold.
- I haven't seen illegal activities yet.

424
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:22,461
Only that Dr. Guevera is scheduled
for a medical procedure...

425
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:23,965
<i>... on November 2.</i>

426
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,159
The Day of the Dead. That's tomorrow.

427
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:29,932
Also identified a member of the group
as Billy Chambers.

428
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:33,440
A fugitive. We've been wanting
to pick him up for some time now.

429
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:36,580
Billy Chambers? Yeah. You sure?

430
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:38,807
- Bet my badge on it.
- <i>Well...</i>

431
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:41,747
<i>... whatever they're up to,</i>
<i>I can guarantee you...</i>

432
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,945
...that it's going
to happen tomorrow.

433
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:46,818
- <i>So I suggest you</i>...
- What's going down tomorrow?

434
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:49,016
If you see an opening, take it.

435
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:52,754
- What do you know?
- Not enough. Get inside.

436
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:01,296
I've got nothing.

437
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:04,368
I gotta get in. I got nothing.

438
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:08,372
Try to make a move.
I don't have a move to make.

439
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:13,009
What are you gonna do, stupid?

440
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,920
Billy Chambers is on the move.

441
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:25,652
Where are you going?

442
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,993
You're buying a taco.

443
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:33,100
This is too easy.

444
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,438
Where are the other guys?

445
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:38,307
This is a setup.

446
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:40,903
It smells like a setup.

447
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:49,516
I'm making my move.

448
00:50:25,923 --> 00:50:27,754
Billy Chambers.

449
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:33,428
- Well, that depends who's asking.
- I thought that was you.

450
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:36,557
- Here, let me pay for this.
- Oh, well, thanks.

451
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,197
Oh, goddamn it.

452
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:44,466
- Is that real?
- Yes, it is.

453
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:47,677
Goddamn.
What took you boys so long?

454
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:50,938
Whoa, hey, friend.

455
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:54,042
You ain't gonna need that.

456
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:57,813
Believe it or not, man, I'm ready to go.

457
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,582
Let's talk over there.

458
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:04,490
After you.

459
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:12,029
Man, I just wanna get out of here.

460
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,134
I've been on the run, hiding out here
down in Mexico...

461
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:19,504
...for the last eight goddamn years.

462
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:24,114
And I've been working
for this here cartel for the last four.

463
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:27,882
I ain't got shit. All I got
is what I'm wearing on my back.

464
00:51:28,052 --> 00:51:31,112
I can't go nowhere.
Sort of got me by the balls, you know?

465
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,552
Jorge Ramirez.

466
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:38,218
I'll take you in under the FBI's
supervision and protection...

467
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:44,266
...until we can take you back, where
you will be prosecuted for your crimes.

468
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:46,664
- In the U.S.?
- In the U.S.

469
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:52,399
The things that I've had to do
for the goddamn cartel are...

470
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,068
...unspeakable.
- You don't know what Barillo's up to?

471
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:58,272
I'm close to the man.

472
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:00,877
I'm real close.

473
00:52:01,052 --> 00:52:03,782
But he don't let nobody in,
that cocksucker.

474
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:06,115
Can you get him close to Barillo?

475
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:12,261
Him?

476
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:15,065
I need your help.

477
00:52:20,104 --> 00:52:21,799
Then you get me out of here.

478
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,035
Then I'll get you out of here.

479
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:26,677
Him too.

480
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:27,439
Him too.

481
00:53:04,649 --> 00:53:07,311
There's cartel on every corner.

482
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,212
Sands told me you handle protection.

483
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:14,755
I don't work for Sands anymore.

484
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:18,020
And since I'm a Mexican,
I can do whatever I want.

485
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,998
Then I guess
I don't work for Sands neither.

486
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,691
- Goodbye.
- There's a price on your head.

487
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:28,836
I'm going to collect. Why don't you
just tell Barillo everything you know.

488
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:31,668
And then maybe
he'll just cut off your hands.

489
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:33,104
And if I don't?

490
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:35,939
You know that old man
I killed in your village?

491
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:38,274
What if your whole village was next?

492
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:42,615
Would you kill them?

493
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:45,221
Me? They certainly would.

494
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:50,255
Then I guess I have no choice...

495
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:53,229
...but to kill you all.

496
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:06,601
You...

497
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:08,341
...are last.

498
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:20,276
That should put him out
for a few days...

499
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:23,243
...and give him some nasty dreams.

500
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:31,819
You have to relax your fingers.

501
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,784
Music is pure, from one's soul.

502
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:44,262
If the soul is pure,
the music flows free.

503
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:54,673
And if the soul isn't pure?

504
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:57,504
Then you must practice
like a motherfucker.

505
00:56:58,682 --> 00:57:00,707
I present to you...

506
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:03,410
...Señor Cucuy.

507
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:09,156
Get this condescending ass
out of here.

508
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:12,189
You want me to break his fingers?

509
00:57:12,363 --> 00:57:14,695
No. I want you to chop them off.

510
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:19,769
- I was just making a joke.
- I wasn't.

511
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:30,242
Sit, please.

512
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:33,815
So...

513
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:37,385
...you are the man who brought us...

514
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:39,250
...the Mariachi.

515
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:43,189
The man I work for, Mr. Sands...

516
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:47,530
...he is using the Mariachi
to kill Gen. Marquez.

517
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:49,859
So you want to join us...

518
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:51,864
...here's how it works.

519
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:55,266
There is the bait. There is the trade.

520
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:58,237
A favor for a favor.

521
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,404
So El Mariachi is the trade?

522
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,114
You are.

523
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:21,996
This ain't my line of work.

524
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:34,072
This guy's all fucked up.

525
01:00:24,555 --> 01:00:28,047
General Marquez is arriving!

526
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,587
Bring out the Mariachi!

527
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:40,270
Bring him out to the General!

528
01:00:57,655 --> 01:01:00,852
I didn't kill you before.
Enough blood had been shed.

529
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:04,327
But I see now...

530
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:07,260
that blood will spill again.

531
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:13,431
General Marquez,
the Mariachi is not here.

532
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,437
He escaped.

533
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:17,899
You too will escape.

534
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:35,052
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Lore...

535
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:48,062
Why?

536
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:50,399
Practice shooting, not drinking.

537
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:54,838
We are on.

538
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:16,160
By order of the President, they
are searching all vehicles

539
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:17,163
for guns and drugs.

540
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:19,825
That fucker's been blockading
all the roads.

541
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,503
Take us back another way.

542
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,931
By order of the president.

543
01:02:26,143 --> 01:02:28,475
Who does this guy think he is?

544
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:30,476
He wants to get rid of me?

545
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:32,308
Fine.

546
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:34,380
<i>I'll get rid of him.</i>

547
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:36,610
<i>Replace him, even.</i>

548
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:41,584
<i>Then I will simply disappear.</i>

549
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:47,754
Hey, <i>vámonos</i>, man.

550
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:05,110
Don't put me out completely.

551
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:11,483
Have my men wait outside.

552
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:59,026
Barillo and Dr. Guevera
must already be inside the building...

553
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:03,105
...having entered
through the back or basement.

554
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:07,069
They should be midprocedure.

555
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:13,939
Federal agents.

556
01:04:15,919 --> 01:04:17,887
This is going down now.

557
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:20,437
If Barillo wanted to look
unrecognizable to authorities...

558
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,635
...he succeeded.

559
01:06:25,182 --> 01:06:30,620
Massive tissue loss due to
an only partially-completed...

560
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:35,622
...facial reconstruction wasn't
necessarily the cause of death.

561
01:07:07,424 --> 01:07:08,550
They switched bodies.

562
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,392
Barillo!

563
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,336
FBI.

564
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:02,870
He was anyway.
Bring him along.

565
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:09,979
Listen, I cannot do everything
by myself.

566
01:08:10,153 --> 01:08:12,053
I need someone
to go in there with me.

567
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:15,157
No. I lost my inside man.
Probably dead.

568
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:19,421
And Cucuy, greedy turd that he is,
ratted me out and has disappeared.

569
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,622
Plus, I'm pretty sure the cartel
is shadowing me.

570
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:27,532
Now, listen, I have got a swell bunch
of guys intercepting Marquez's army...

571
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:29,102
...but they've got no guns.

572
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:32,708
I want you to understand me.
This is no time to screw the pooch...

573
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:36,367
...because this is supposed to be
the big dance number, all right?

574
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:37,877
Hello?

575
01:08:38,048 --> 01:08:39,743
Hello? Are you there?

576
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:42,680
Okay, okay,
I'm going to freak right out.

577
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:01,564
I would like the <i>puerco pibil</i>
and a tequila with lime.

578
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,307
Yeah, listen, I need a new line.

579
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,074
This one's been compromised.

580
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:17,319
Okay? Thank you.

581
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:20,581
I'll be waiting here
at the La Vaca Volando.

582
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:22,122
That's right.

583
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:25,386
The Flying Cow.

584
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:31,126
You really didn't see it coming,
did you?

585
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:51,979
Sorry, baby, I told you I wasn't
interested in your scheme.

586
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:53,945
Too small.

587
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:59,754
Oh, my Christ. Is that Barillo?

588
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:04,383
That's the new Barillo. The old Barillo
died in surgery a few hours ago.

589
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:07,621
What kind of cartel would have you
running its operation?

590
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:10,399
I'm his daughter.

591
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,629
You've been spying on my operation
for some time.

592
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:21,174
I feel it's only fair to warn you
that killing me is crossing the line...

593
01:11:21,344 --> 01:11:24,939
...and you will have every marine
from here to Guantánamo Bay...

594
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:29,108
...up your keister, mister.
So just know that.

595
01:11:29,286 --> 01:11:34,815
Fortunately for you, nothing you did
is worth dying over.

596
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:39,052
You have only seen too much.

597
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:45,096
We are going to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

598
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:00,245
On this day of the dead,

599
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:03,176
I offer you a chance for a new life.

600
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:16,257
That sounded a little extreme
for a parade.

601
01:12:16,433 --> 01:12:18,298
Troops are coming up
from the south.

602
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,935
- Whose?
- Emiliano Marquez.

603
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:25,004
- Well, what do we do?
- We stay here. This place is fortified.

604
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:29,968
It's much easier to defend this place
than to chance going out in the open.

605
01:12:30,613 --> 01:12:33,980
Nicholas? What are you talking
about, "fortified"? Come here!

606
01:12:35,318 --> 01:12:39,516
Just stay clear of those windows, sir.
You let me handle it.

607
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:57,468
My name is Sheldon Jeffrey Sands.

608
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,074
I work for the Central
Intelligence Agency.

609
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:06,512
I set them up.
I watch them fall.

610
01:13:12,822 --> 01:13:14,414
I'm living <i>la vida loca</i>.

611
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:32,365
No!

612
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:40,508
I'm terribly sorry about your
chewing gum, but listen.

613
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:42,708
I will give you this...

614
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:48,214
...if you'll be my eyes.

615
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:50,484
It's a dollar.

616
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:52,016
I meant...

617
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:53,892
...this.

618
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:57,130
I need you to take me
to the center of the city.

619
01:13:58,368 --> 01:13:59,960
Is someone following you?

620
01:14:00,236 --> 01:14:03,728
It's difficult for me to tell right now
because I'm having a bad day.

621
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,999
Do you see someone?

622
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:10,136
Yes, he's getting close.

623
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,208
Listen, have you ever seen
one of these?

624
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:19,179
Have you used one?

625
01:14:19,823 --> 01:14:21,552
Don't ever,
because they're bad.

626
01:14:21,724 --> 01:14:24,249
But what I need for you to do
is to aim this...

627
01:14:24,427 --> 01:14:28,420
...at the bad man who's following us
and shoot him in the head.

628
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:29,826
Kill him?

629
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:33,696
Oh, yeah. Very <i>mátalo</i>.
Close?

630
01:14:36,005 --> 01:14:38,064
Okay. Smoke him.

631
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:43,536
Smoke the fucker. Just send him
straight to fucking Broadway.

632
01:14:46,049 --> 01:14:47,038
What?

633
01:14:48,351 --> 01:14:50,319
Okay. Come here.

634
01:14:54,424 --> 01:14:55,914
Right or left?

635
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:04,291
Was that my right or your right?

636
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:29,454
Wrong man.

637
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:32,919
Sorry.

638
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:50,340
Look me in the eyes...

639
01:15:52,448 --> 01:15:54,075
...and then kill me.

640
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:15,837
Good boy. Now you're thinking.

641
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:20,499
Take me to the center of the city,
where there will be even more dough.

642
01:16:42,732 --> 01:16:44,791
For you...

643
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:48,629
for our daughter...

644
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:52,741
for Mexico.

645
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:32,608
In my past, I'd take on evil
from the bottom.

646
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:35,548
Now I realize...

647
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:37,345
...start at the top.

648
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:42,080
The president is a good man.

649
01:17:43,559 --> 01:17:46,289
I'll go around back.
Meet me in five.

650
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:51,862
Watch him.

651
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:05,243
We could torture him.

652
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:09,074
He's FBI.

653
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:12,050
He's retired.

654
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:13,883
That doesn't count.

655
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,623
I was tortured once.

656
01:18:19,796 --> 01:18:21,263
I didn't like it.

657
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:24,426
You know what the fucked up thing is?

658
01:18:25,268 --> 01:18:27,327
They tore out my left nut.

659
01:18:30,473 --> 01:18:33,909
That sort of turned me off of the
whole thing.

660
01:18:34,477 --> 01:18:36,877
What should we do with him?

661
01:18:40,783 --> 01:18:43,149
Let's go eat about it.

662
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:59,195
Hey Snow White, watch that
fucking pig.

663
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:13,508
Just lay low.
They'll leave us alone.

664
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:26,085
What the fuck?!

665
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,424
I don't like military.

666
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:43,035
Get out.

667
01:19:43,546 --> 01:19:45,673
- Why are we stopping?
- We can't go further.

668
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:49,515
- Why not?
- Look out there. It's a coup d'état!

669
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:53,416
I can't see, fuck-mook!
I have no eyes.

670
01:19:55,091 --> 01:19:56,888
Well, then listen to it, fucker!

671
01:19:57,059 --> 01:20:01,519
The military's throwing over the
presidency. All hell's broken loose.

672
01:20:01,798 --> 01:20:04,096
You guys have to get out now.

673
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:13,798
Keep your money because
I'm not moving one inch.

674
01:21:56,879 --> 01:21:58,437
Fuck! Now what?

675
01:21:59,048 --> 01:22:01,482
- Do you know armor-piercing bullets?
- Yeah.

676
01:22:01,651 --> 01:22:03,585
These are much better.

677
01:22:27,209 --> 01:22:28,904
What do you want in life?

678
01:22:31,013 --> 01:22:32,310
Good choice.

679
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:45,555
- You ready?
- Yeah.

680
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:46,922
Okay, let's go!

681
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:38,704
It's no longer safe to be here.
Let's go.

682
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:58,993
You have a meeting
with Gen. Marquez, sir.

683
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:53,784
It feels like you need
some protection, sir.

684
01:24:56,826 --> 01:24:57,918
Who are you guys?

685
01:24:58,994 --> 01:25:00,928
Sons of Mexico, sir.

686
01:25:10,873 --> 01:25:13,341
Are we in front of the building?

687
01:25:23,586 --> 01:25:24,575
Okay.

688
01:25:26,889 --> 01:25:28,754
This is it, kid.

689
01:25:32,928 --> 01:25:34,987
I don't hear you running.

690
01:27:07,456 --> 01:27:10,516
Why would they want me dead?
I've done nothing but help them.

691
01:27:10,693 --> 01:27:13,685
What are you talking about?
Let me show you something.

692
01:27:13,862 --> 01:27:15,830
Look out there! You see?

693
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:20,260
Well, don't look too close, <i>presidente</i>.

694
01:27:20,469 --> 01:27:23,632
But your people are out there
fighting for you, you understand?

695
01:27:23,839 --> 01:27:25,329
Take off your jacket.

696
01:27:25,541 --> 01:27:27,441
- This also?
- Yes.

697
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:29,402
Put this on.

698
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:03,001
What is this, payoff?

699
01:28:03,178 --> 01:28:05,203
This is money someone paid
to kill you.

700
01:28:05,381 --> 01:28:08,316
And now it's money
to save your life, <i>presidente</i>.

701
01:28:08,651 --> 01:28:11,518
Here, get some tequila for yourself.

702
01:28:47,723 --> 01:28:49,953
Leave here and lock the door.

703
01:28:58,334 --> 01:28:59,733
Carolina?

704
01:29:02,438 --> 01:29:03,564
She died.

705
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:06,732
Your daughter?

706
01:29:08,711 --> 01:29:09,735
She died.

707
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,869
And you?

708
01:29:16,985 --> 01:29:17,849
Dead.

709
01:29:20,422 --> 01:29:21,446
And I?

710
01:29:22,825 --> 01:29:24,053
Alive and well.

711
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:41,437
In hell.

712
01:29:58,394 --> 01:30:01,420
Everything in its place...

713
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:08,786
You fucking little monkey.

714
01:31:09,498 --> 01:31:11,193
Stand up.

715
01:31:18,106 --> 01:31:20,074
See anything you like?

716
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:35,479
No.

717
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:05,012
Do you remember a man
named Archuleta?

718
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:07,178
Why?

719
01:32:07,523 --> 01:32:12,187
I present to you Special Agent
Jorge Ramirez.

720
01:32:14,329 --> 01:32:19,733
You tortured and murdered Agent
Archuleta. He was my partner.

721
01:32:20,068 --> 01:32:21,626
He was also my friend.

722
01:32:22,304 --> 01:32:27,173
Agent Ramirez, you have
to follow certain rules.

723
01:32:27,342 --> 01:32:30,243
Oh, I'm retired.

724
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:34,371
Rules don't apply to me
any more than they do to you.

725
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:36,984
- Mr. Chambers.
- Yes, sir.

726
01:32:37,152 --> 01:32:38,915
You're just going to stand there?

727
01:32:39,555 --> 01:32:43,047
I'm afraid anything but standing's
gonna cost you extra.

728
01:32:47,429 --> 01:32:48,828
You leave me no choice.

729
01:33:56,231 --> 01:33:58,290
Did you get your man?

730
01:33:58,467 --> 01:33:59,627
One of them.

731
01:34:01,737 --> 01:34:07,471
If that isn't interagency cooperation,
I just don't know what is.

732
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:10,941
See you later.

733
01:34:12,714 --> 01:34:14,443
Fuck you.

734
01:34:17,352 --> 01:34:18,910
Are you okay?

735
01:34:20,088 --> 01:34:21,521
I don't know.

736
01:34:22,891 --> 01:34:24,791
You will be.

737
01:35:32,994 --> 01:35:36,452
What do you want in life?

738
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:40,993
To be free...

739
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:44,372
Simple.

740
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:48,369
No.
