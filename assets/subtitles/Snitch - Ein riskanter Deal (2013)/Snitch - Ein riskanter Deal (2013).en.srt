00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,624
<I>two boats to begin
the holiday break. 

8
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,785
Two boats man?
That's like 2.000 pills.

9
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:58,618
<I>OK, another Seven G's is what it is.
And some of that could be yours. 

10
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:00,621
No, I'm Good Man.

11
00:01:00,622 --> 00:01:02,887
<I>Look man. you don't
got to do anything.

12
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:05,314
<I>I just got to ship the box
to your house OK? 

13
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,017
<I>I can't fly with this stuff. 

14
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:13,323
<I>I don't know, bro. - Come on, it's for
like a day until I get there.

15
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:16,866
<I>And you can even have some. And
you said that Amanda are dying to roll

16
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:20,270
<I>I'll talk to you later, alright? 
I'll text you the traffic...

17
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:21,772
No. Don't.

18
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:25,677
{PHONE RINGING}
Hey, why don't you answer the phone?
- I was skyping with Craig.

19
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:28,280
Hallo?

20
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:32,785
Hey, Maggy. No, Nick said the layoff
wouldn't affect our division.

21
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:49,962
Mike I understand, but the bottom line is
I need to buy all four rigs.

22
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:52,349
Anything less than that, There's no point.

23
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,196
I might as well just keep leasing.

24
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:58,201
Well that's what they do, those hollers
They get together once a year,..

25
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,805
..and they raise a raid
before the gas prices .

26
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:04,208
They do, because they know
they can get away with it.

27
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:08,714
See the contract?

28
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:11,417
Yeah, it’s real. But I just don't know
when it's going to start.

29
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,021
How much money am I going to have to borrow?

30
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:20,331
Alright, let's move some equity around.

31
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:25,044
I've been rolling the dice my whole life,
might as well do it aging.

32
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,647
I got to go.

33
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,150
Solid week boys, thank you.

34
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,706
I figure Analyze would have you
putting on brims and balloon.

35
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:34,857
I'm still out getting Izzy's cake.

36
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:36,384
Good luck with that.
- I need it.

37
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,886
Have a good weekend, Wayne.
- See you.

38
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:06,206
You know there's no OT, unless
it's authorized.

39
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:08,910
I don't look for OT, sir.
This guy broke a pallet.

40
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:12,013
I get my bags out of the wheatear
It's going to rain tonight.

41
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:16,619
Good heads up.

42
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:24,551
Whoa sir, I got this.
Seriously, I don't want you get dirty.

43
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:26,953
It's alright.
Let's do it together.

44
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:31,660
I'm John Matthews.
- Daniel James.

45
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:35,063
Good to meet you, Daniel.

46
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:36,766
Don't worry about it.

47
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,231
How long have you
been working here?

48
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:41,271
Do you mean work for you?

49
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,274
About 3 weeks now.

50
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:46,038
What do you think
about give me that raise already?

51
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:47,304
Fat chance, buddy.

52
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,083
You got to try, right?
You got to give it a whirl.

53
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:20,612
Packages for Jason Collins?
- Yeah, that's me.

54
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:23,033
Alright, sign right there.

55
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:24,620
Alright, thanks.

56
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,702
Have a Good one.
- Thanks man.

57
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:11,242
<I>Department of Justice! This is DEA!
Open the door!

58
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,853
<I>Right there! Back fence!

59
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:04,795
Down! Get on the ground!

60
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,480
<I>This is central. Reporting in.

61
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,480
<I> Acknowledge.
We have custody. 

62
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:28,319
Cake.

63
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,190
That looks so good .

64
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,728
I love you.

65
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:40,733
Hi, baby.
You're having fun on your birthday, Izzy ?

66
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,043
Hey, Sylvie. Let me call you back.

67
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:52,947
What?

68
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,323
They tell you anything?

69
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,890
Just to wait here
until we're called.

70
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:16,250
They're treating him like he's some
kind of major criminal, John.

71
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:20,995
We'll straight 'em out.

72
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:23,058
Is he in with my last name or yours?

73
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:25,217
You know we changed it to mine.

74
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,088
Why are you even asking?

75
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:40,176
Hi, my sons Jason Collins..
- Take a seat and wait to be called.

76
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:42,246
Can you at least tell me where he is?

77
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,756
You notice anything different?

78
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:07,371
Like what?

79
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:09,638
With him. Who he's
been hanging with.

80
00:08:09,664 --> 00:08:11,051
Anything out of ordinary.

81
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:14,455
No, John. I haven't notice anything.

82
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:16,778
This is such bullshit.

83
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:18,985
I mean he's a good kid.

84
00:08:20,863 --> 00:08:22,665
Mike's sending a lawyer.

85
00:08:22,691 --> 00:08:25,493
Good, you can afford it.

86
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:32,075
Didn't you quit?

87
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:45,289
Mr. and Mrs. Matthews?
- Yeah.

88
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,092
Thanks for coming.
- Where's Jason?

89
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,959
They're moving him from this
holding cell to court room.

90
00:08:50,985 --> 00:08:53,499
He's scheduled for a
hearing this evening.

91
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,602
It's alright. Leave him in jail for
a little bit. Scare the hell out of him.

92
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,479
No one's trying to
scare your son.

93
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,287
This is federal case.

94
00:09:01,288 --> 00:09:03,830
The amount of MDMA or
ecstasy they found

95
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:06,993
means they've charged Jason for
distribution of narcotics.

96
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:10,698
Jason said that a friend asks to have
the drugs sent to the house.

97
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:13,905
What friend?
- Friend with the name Craig Johnson?

98
00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:15,344
That's his best friend.

99
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,510
Christ, I have known Craig
since he was little.

100
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:20,825
Jason was arrested trying to
mail the pills,..

101
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,183
..and he agreed to work with the government.

102
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:25,986
What do you mean,
"agreed to work with the government"?

103
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:28,207
Both Craig and Jason
are being charged under

104
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,191
federal mandatory
minimum sentencing laws.

105
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:32,997
These laws were design to
ensure high level drug trafficker ..

106
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:36,099
..get them to snitch on other trafficker
in order to reduce their own sentences

107
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,798
However, most of the conviction over half

108
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:42,206
have been first time offender
like your son.

109
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,911
So, Craig is implicating Jason?
- Yes, in order to reduce the sentence..

110
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:50,116
..Craig told the DEA, that Jason agreed
to have the pills sent to the house,..

111
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:53,016
..and also has agreed to help sell them.
- What?

112
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:56,220
Now Jason has denied both of these
accusation. Do you believe them?

113
00:09:56,221 --> 00:10:00,124
Of course I believe him. He would never be
involved in anything like this.

114
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:02,828
Are we talking about
probation here or

115
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:05,030
could he actually go
to jail for this?

116
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:07,434
The mandatory minimum laws are very simple.

117
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:09,385
The amount of jail
time depends upon

118
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:11,438
the amount of drugs.
There are no mid..

119
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:12,540
Wait, what is that mean?

120
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,844
Jason is facing a mandatory minimum
sentence of 10 years in prison.

121
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:17,347
10 years?
- Are you out of your mind!

122
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:20,037
He just got accepted at collage.

123
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:21,706
John tell him.

124
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh God..

125
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,320
Jason.

126
00:10:55,814 --> 00:11:00,218
United States vs. Jason Collins.

127
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:07,391
how could they deny him bail?
He's never even been arrested before.

128
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:11,196
You want to know the truth?

129
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:12,827
I knew something like
this would happen.

130
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:15,166
I figure if I just got him off to college.
But no.

131
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,270
Jason has no God damn idea
what real responsibility mean.

132
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:20,673
Especially while still being baby
all the time.

133
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:22,122
And when your own
son doesn't want

134
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,477
have anything to do
with you anymore?

135
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:24,931
Not true.
- Not true?

136
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:25,980
That's not true at all.

137
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:28,784
It's just really hard for kids who
go through divorces.

138
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:31,329
I acted out when my father left.

139
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:34,190
Yeah well, he's not
a kid anymore.

140
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:37,294
Not while he's sitting in that cell.

141
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:39,006
The sprinkler’s on?

142
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,224
Is everything have
to go to shit?

143
00:11:58,216 --> 00:11:59,718
Here's the situation. It's very simple

144
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,458
You help them make traffic drug arrests..

145
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:04,849
And they will reduce your sentence
from 10 years to 2.

146
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,782
1 suspended.

147
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:09,629
I told you. I don't know anyone else.
Just Craig.

148
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,909
Bullshit.

149
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:14,635
Your mom told me she
smelt marijuana of you before .

150
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:17,530
Where did you get
that from, huh?

151
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:18,961
Jason, this is serious.

152
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:20,249
Come on honey,

153
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:22,490
you got to tell us who sold you the pot.

154
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:28,063
I didn't have to buy it.

155
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:30,049
Amanda's dad grows it.

156
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:32,374
He has medicinal licence.

157
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,569
It's legal.

158
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,549
I just took some. I just wanted to try it.

159
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:40,420
OK. Are there any of
your friend who do

160
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:42,755
drugs and might
interested in selling?

161
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:46,211
What, you mean
setting someone up ?

162
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:49,133
Like Craig did to me?

163
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,014
No Way.

164
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:56,992
You better wake up right now.

165
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:58,819
Because this is
really happening.

166
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,303
You going to take
that plead

167
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:02,324
and you going to help them make the arrest.

168
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:04,219
You hear me?

169
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:07,210
I'll take my chances in court.

170
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:10,815
No, you won't. If you do not work with
the prosecutor..

171
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:13,618
..they can raise the minimum limits
to 30 years.

172
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:16,796
Which means you'll be out in time
for your 50th birthday.

173
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,800
And they are banning over 90%
on convictions.

174
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:22,422
Jason, baby. Please
listen to him.

175
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:24,693
We don't have another choice.

176
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:31,442
I'm not setting anyone up.
- Baby. - I won't do it.

177
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,848
Yes you are.

178
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:35,998
Listen to me dammit!

179
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:39,778
You think you know what you're doing?

180
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,749
You have no idea
until you spend the

181
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:44,208
next 10 years of
your life in prison.

182
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:48,128
I'm not going to let that
happen to you, son.

183
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:48,866
You hear me?

184
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:52,089
You're not the one who have to do it.

185
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:22,549
Morning, John.
I need to show you something.

186
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,651
This is a..

187
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:29,592
What a beauty ain't they?

188
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,202
And they say the other 2 will
ready next month.

189
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:34,805
Great.
I got to make a phone call.

190
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:43,814
Terry, this is John Matthews.

191
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,718
Good.

192
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,168
We definitely got to get out
we'll hit a few. Very soon.

193
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:51,485
Let me ask you something?

194
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:54,573
Do you have a connection
to Joanne Keeghan?

195
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:57,176
US attorney down town.

196
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:22,401
Mr. Matthews, you've got a lot of friends
in this city.

197
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:25,405
I received 4 phone calls
in matters of an hour.

198
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:28,464
I'm sure you'd do the same for your kids.
I don't have any children.

199
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:31,468
Alright, well.

200
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,480
18 years old.

201
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:36,374
You must've had him
when you're quite young.

202
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,878
Sophomore in collage.
Me and his mom were high school sweetheart.

203
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,082
Well, you have my sympathy.

204
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:47,195
But I believe in
mandatory minimum laws.

205
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,020
We're fighting the world right
now, not just on drugs.

206
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:51,560
But the violence they bring.

207
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:55,565
And we are losing badly, so it's time
for all our sake we have to turn this around.

208
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:57,668
Ms. Keeghan I agree.
I do.

209
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:00,834
But my son, Jason. He's not a drug dealer.
He's a good kid.

210
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:04,639
And he just made really dumb naive mistake.

211
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,542
And he's willing to do anything he can
to help out the situation.

212
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:10,425
The only drug dealer
that he knows is..

213
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:13,204
Craig Johnson, who you already
have in custody.

214
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,686
I'm really sorry to hear that.

215
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,775
Please, There's got to be
something I could do.

216
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:25,880
The laws are design to preclude
any special circumstances.

217
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:28,762
So it's really quite simple. We'll need
your son help us make arrest..

218
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:30,865
..before we can help them
reduce the sentence.

219
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:33,360
Which he can't do that, or
isn't willing to do that..

220
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:38,059
..then there's really nothing we can do.
I'm sorry.

221
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,664
And now I have to be somewhere else.

222
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,657
What if I did it for him?
- What?

223
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:47,999
What if I help you make arrest?

224
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,369
It's not the way it works.
- Please.

225
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,303
I just want to help my son.

226
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:56,875
I understand, I really
am sorry, but..

227
00:16:57,176 --> 00:17:00,480
..my hands are tied.
There's nothing I can do

228
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:03,683
Thank you for stopping by.

229
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,840
Hallo. /
Hi.

230
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,617
You're here to see?
- Jason Collins.

231
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:33,721
Just sign in.

232
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:40,137
Proceed to booth 3. /
Thank you.

233
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:11,939
What happened?

234
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:15,497
Nothing.

235
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:20,265
Tell me.
It's OK.

236
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,079
Talk to me son.

237
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,728
it's OK, tell me.

238
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:36,612
You remember when someone keep tipping
and nagging your house?

239
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:39,315
That was me.

240
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:43,346
I would sit around
the corner and laugh

241
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,622
I watch you try to clean it up.

242
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:49,373
Doesn't matter now, Jason.

243
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,380
The last time I did.

244
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:55,406
I didn't know you were out of town.

245
00:18:58,084 --> 00:19:02,309
I felt like crap watching
Elize do it herself.

246
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,214
So, I pretended I was stopping by.

247
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:10,619
I help her.
- She told me.

248
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:16,444
I hated that you have to live in that
big house and new family.

249
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:19,947
Me and mom are just stuck in that old one.

250
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:25,159
I wanted you to live with me.

251
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:27,612
I wanted you in my life.

252
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,828
It was my fault, not yours.

253
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:37,933
I was always gone.
I was always on those trucks.

254
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:41,437
I was always working,
got so caught up.

255
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:44,265
And I'm failing you as a father.

256
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:48,157
That's exactly what I did.

257
00:19:52,763 --> 00:19:58,469
I should've never taken that packages,
I know what was in it.

258
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,472
I should've just told the guy got
the wrong address .

259
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:06,078
But I didn't, because me and Amanda
wanted to try something.

260
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:09,162
But I swear to you dad, I would
never ever..

261
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:12,145
.. I wasn't planning in helping
to sell that stuff.

262
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:15,949
I'm not a drug dealer.

263
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,506
You believe me, right?

264
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,730
Of course I believe you.

265
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:25,113
And I know
I should be punish..

266
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:29,685
..for what I did.
But not like this.

267
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:39,076
Jason, don't cry.

268
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:42,384
Don't cry, Jason.
Not in here.

269
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:46,389
Listen to me, Jason.

270
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:50,394
You got to show me.
You got to stand up for yourself in here.

271
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:53,798
You have to.

272
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:57,703
I promise you, I'm going to get you
out of here.

273
00:20:57,704 --> 00:20:58,625
How?

274
00:20:58,951 --> 00:21:02,033
You just got to trust me.

275
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:07,514
I love you.

276
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:26,553
What you want?
- Coke.

277
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:28,856
Crack is whack, man.
Who do you think you are, dude?

278
00:23:28,857 --> 00:23:31,459
I just go to somebody else.

279
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:39,367
Look man, you really buying it?
Money talks.

280
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,350
Get off me.

281
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,887
Give it back.

282
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:01,791
Cops are rolling!

283
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,527
What the hell were you thinking?

284
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:25,716
I'm sorry I threw your name
down at the station.

285
00:24:26,017 --> 00:24:28,894
Your son is not going to be better off
if you're dead.

286
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:31,598
Clearly what I did last night
didn't work out

287
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,087
Clearly?
- Please, what do I got to do?

288
00:24:35,088 --> 00:24:37,135
You are so stubborn. You're
not going to stop are you?

289
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:38,917
No. I'm not

290
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:44,798
Alight. hypothetically,..

291
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,799
..I would need airtight arrest of
someone in possession of narcotics,..

292
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,407
..in the amount of constitute conspiracy
to distribute.

293
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,488
If we're talking
cocaine, that would be

294
00:24:53,514 --> 00:24:55,960
at least 500 gram
or half a kilo.

295
00:24:57,738 --> 00:25:00,740
What?
- I'm in a construction business.

296
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:03,744
And we have ex-cons who are working
the yard all the time.

297
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:06,248
Maybe someone knows someone
who knows someone.

298
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:09,151
You're their boss.
Why would they trust you?

299
00:25:09,152 --> 00:25:11,425
Let me worry about that.
Believe me, I am not worried.

300
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:13,882
Because the risk is all yours

301
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,633
Come on. I'll give you a lift
No, thank you. But I'm good

302
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:28,330
I'm the boss.
Get in.

303
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:42,585
How's the job treating you.
In fact that I got a job.

304
00:26:44,088 --> 00:26:46,490
I guess, I'm just trying
to say thank you.

305
00:26:46,491 --> 00:26:50,294
Me and my family really
appreciate the opportunity.

306
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:53,900
It's got to be hard for a..

307
00:26:54,801 --> 00:26:58,204
..ex-con.
That's why we're here?

308
00:26:58,205 --> 00:27:01,166
You need to talk to me
about my past?

309
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,520
I was completely honest
on my application.

310
00:27:04,546 --> 00:27:05,872
But if there's anything else..

311
00:27:06,273 --> 00:27:08,984
No. That's it.
That's not it

312
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:25,201
Couple of years ago I caught
2 of my drivers..

313
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,103
..they were transporting
some stuff

314
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:32,208
They know that the cops rarely stop semis
And even if they did,..

315
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:34,911
..sure as hell didn't have time to search.

316
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:41,419
They were low level small time.

317
00:27:42,821 --> 00:27:46,825
I was hoping that someone with the
connections into that world..

318
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:49,127
Are you accused me
of something, sir?

319
00:27:49,553 --> 00:27:51,431
You think I've done something?

320
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:52,933
No.

321
00:27:53,234 --> 00:27:56,346
With all due respect sir.
Why don't you just

322
00:27:56,372 --> 00:27:58,964
go ahead and tell me what it is
that you want from me.

323
00:28:02,244 --> 00:28:04,746
An introduction.

324
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:09,251
I can't help you with that.

325
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:19,162
You give me info the right people
I'll give you $ 5,000.

326
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:21,865
Something good come out of it,
I'll give you another $ 5,000.

327
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,669
That's $ 10,000.
- No, I can count.

328
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:28,974
Like I said, I can't help you with that.

329
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:32,378
Why not?

330
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:38,382
You see I'm on the track of
my life again now

331
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,327
And I'm doing it for my family.

332
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:43,188
That's why I'm working like I do
I sweat my ass everyday in that yard.

333
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:46,292
This conversation is just..

334
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:49,496
This conversation is
a conspiracy alright.

335
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:55,202
And that can take me 25 to life.

336
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:58,907
I will act..
I'd appreciate it

337
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:01,409
maybe we just pretend this never happens.
OK?

338
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:05,914
I'll see you.
I just need an introduction, OK.

339
00:29:05,915 --> 00:29:08,317
Go home, be happy with what you got.

340
00:29:08,318 --> 00:29:10,620
Thank you for the coffee.

341
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,530
Daniel!

342
00:29:24,134 --> 00:29:26,636
Twenty Grand

343
00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:30,641
I'll double it because of
the risk you're taking.

344
00:30:05,328 --> 00:30:09,732
Anthony, go inside.
- Come on dad.

345
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:13,297
Go home, now.
Go, Go on.

346
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:16,006
What are you looking at?

347
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,952
Hold. Hold up.

348
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:30,016
I don't care you are slang what you slang,
you are smoke what you smoke.

349
00:30:30,017 --> 00:30:31,692
We put holes on each other.
If that's what you want

350
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:33,034
But I'm going to tell you right now.

351
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,314
You got to stay away from my son.
You hear me?

352
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:46,122
What are you stupid, Flaco?

353
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:49,364
This guy is 'Shark Caller'

354
00:30:56,744 --> 00:30:59,969
Dad, why'd you...
- Anthony, go play your game.

355
00:31:01,507 --> 00:31:02,960
Alright, what happened?

356
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,842
Nothing happened bee.
It's just father and son stuff.

357
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,900
What are you doing?
- I'm going to work.

358
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:14,518
What do you mean work?

359
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,442
Larry called. Told me I have to be there
in 1 hour. - Come on bee, he can't do that.

360
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,543
He can't just call you 7:30 at night
telling you to come work ..

361
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:22,601
He can do whatever he want Daniel.

362
00:31:22,602 --> 00:31:25,914
That is if I want to keep my job.

363
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,089
Look, I'm already late.

364
00:31:32,115 --> 00:31:35,478
There's food for both
of you on the stove.

365
00:31:40,477 --> 00:31:43,789
What are you saying?

366
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,399
Let me ask you something.

367
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:55,369
What if me and my little
partner over there

368
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:58,421

cruise to the office?

369
00:31:58,691 --> 00:32:00,686
We charmed your guest.

370
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,680
Fatten up them tips.

371
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:06,313
Make a world for everybody.

372
00:32:06,314 --> 00:32:08,507
I'd like that.

373
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,908
OK, I have to go.
Don't go to work.

374
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:20,077
I love you.
- I love you.

375
00:32:20,078 --> 00:32:22,246
I love you.

376
00:32:24,992 --> 00:32:28,614
Hey Ant get on the couch man.

377
00:32:31,377 --> 00:32:33,618
Sit down bud.

378
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:38,845
Why do we move here?

379
00:32:42,237 --> 00:32:45,333
We move here so you don't have to hangout
with fools like that.

380
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:49,060
That's why. Alright?

381
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:51,879
There ain't nobody else to hang with
around here.

382
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,736
I want to go back to
our old apartment.

383
00:32:53,762 --> 00:32:55,994
You know we can't,
so don't say it.

384
00:32:55,995 --> 00:32:58,528
Look man, I know it's hard.

385
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:02,334
At some times like this,
I promise you..

386
00:33:02,335 --> 00:33:05,487
One day we got to move somewhere,
And you going to get real friends.

387
00:33:05,838 --> 00:33:08,546
Real friends.

388
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:11,911
You ain't got to proof nothing,
you got to do nothing for them.

389
00:33:11,912 --> 00:33:14,494
But those punks out there, man..

390
00:33:14,597 --> 00:33:16,857
You're better than that.

391
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:19,642
Let me tell you something else.

392
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,551
You're better than me, man.

393
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:27,322
So much better than me.

394
00:33:27,323 --> 00:33:30,321
Hey, what's a 'Shark Caller'?

395
00:33:30,347 --> 00:33:32,845
Where did you hear that?

396
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,116
Don't worry about that.

397
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,852
I love you man.
And I'm proud of you.

398
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:44,967
You need to be smart.

399
00:33:44,968 --> 00:33:48,322
Go get your homework man.
We going to bang it out.

400
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,420
Just keep going man.
All the way to the end

401
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:38,868
Don't stop.

402
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:50,126
Right here?
- OK.

403
00:34:55,575 --> 00:34:58,953
I need to go alone first.

404
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,943
This guy in here, Malik.

405
00:35:00,944 --> 00:35:03,209
If he never see you before.
Shit I'm going to tell you right now.

406
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,805
You never going to leave this block

407
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:07,262
That's a promise.

408
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:59,064
What 'up Coz?
What 'up, Malik?

409
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:01,543
The last I see your ass..

410
00:36:01,544 --> 00:36:03,431
..where was it last?

411
00:36:03,457 --> 00:36:05,602
Stand stone, man.

412
00:36:06,303 --> 00:36:08,639
It's cold as hell up there was it Coz?

413
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,319
That's true.

414
00:36:21,107 --> 00:36:24,312
Me and old boy right here
we used to get it in.

415
00:36:24,313 --> 00:36:27,980
Moving 'product' like we was
the United Nation and shit.

416
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:32,319
'Coz nobody comes to that paper.
- Colour that matters is grey.

417
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,891
So how long you've been home man?
You just come now and see me.

418
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:36,970
Come on, Malik you know it.

419
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:40,332
I can't be associated with no ass
criminals now.

420
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:43,938
I hear you.
That's why I'd be in here.

421
00:36:43,939 --> 00:36:46,754
Two strikers like us man
we can't walk the striff.

422
00:36:46,755 --> 00:36:49,436
It ain't safe

423
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:52,884
So I'm saying, you back
in the game right?

424
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:55,305
How come we don't cross out with your Home?

425
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:57,592
Just can't have any of your
Home bad ideas man

426
00:36:57,618 --> 00:37:00,068
I'm telling you, them days
they are over for me Malik, that's it.

427
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:03,244
Right here.
It's a one time.

428
00:37:03,643 --> 00:37:07,511
You're smart Coz.
Real smart.

429
00:37:07,512 --> 00:37:10,249
Keep that pain to yourself.

430
00:37:31,357 --> 00:37:34,039
Yo Home, kill the beat.

431
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:52,543
I'm John Matthews.

432
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:59,066
I see that's the way action I was
looking for player.

433
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:04,493
Ain't never had wine you
grilled before, huh?

434
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:10,268
Now see, if you with the popo..

435
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:13,469
..and you be the biggest
pussy pig I'd ever see.

436
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:20,147
Now let's have a honest conversation

437
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,534
as to why you're in my crib.

438
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:38,520
I don't have product..

439
00:38:38,546 --> 00:38:40,636
..or distribution.

440
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:44,075
But I do know business.

441
00:38:45,628 --> 00:38:47,151
If anyone needed a transportation..

442
00:38:47,177 --> 00:38:49,859
..I can provide that.

443
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,190
With no risk.
- There's always risks.

444
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:55,054
My way, minimizes it.

445
00:38:55,055 --> 00:38:56,522
See what I want to know is why
as a successful..

446
00:38:56,548 --> 00:38:59,498
..businessman man like your self
want to take and risk it all?

447
00:39:04,212 --> 00:39:06,897
I'm in construction business.

448
00:39:06,898 --> 00:39:09,502
The way the economy is
today it's all gone to shit.

449
00:39:09,528 --> 00:39:12,842
And I don't see any chance of
them coming back

450
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,941
And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to
keep my business afloat.

451
00:39:15,942 --> 00:39:18,609
I've worked too hard
for too long.

452
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:24,372
So how much weight can you move?

453
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:27,671
My trucks? Half a ton..

454
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:29,307
..without attacking attention.

455
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,854
Half a ton?

456
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:34,052
Man if I have a thousand
pounds I wouldn't..

457
00:39:34,078 --> 00:39:36,412
..be sitting in this dump right now.

458
00:39:36,488 --> 00:39:38,444
All I'm saying is,
whatever you want to move.

459
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,478
it won’t matters in my trucks.

460
00:39:40,954 --> 00:39:43,238
You know they weight
the trucks at the state line.

461
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:45,375
How you going to cover that?

462
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:48,436
We offset the weight.
Counts off all the time.

463
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:51,380
If the police get lucky,
they only get the driver.

464
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:54,284
We won't be there for the holding
or unloading.

465
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:57,027
Sounded like you're ready for the game.

466
00:39:57,427 --> 00:40:01,375
So, what are you talking player?
- 15% whole sale.

467
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:03,237
I give nobody over 10%.

468
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:07,216
You know I got something for you too.

469
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:12,418
If the first run goes good
I'm willing to re-negotiate.

470
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:15,546
You're going to drive the first load.

471
00:40:18,478 --> 00:40:24,173
Everybody know what game Malik is.
We have to see are you for real first.

472
00:40:24,743 --> 00:40:27,634
And then, maybe..

473
00:40:27,797 --> 00:40:30,565
Just maybe, we going to back to talking.

474
00:40:33,543 --> 00:40:35,481
Alright.

475
00:40:35,482 --> 00:40:36,680
Why don't you wait
outside for a minute.

476
00:40:36,706 --> 00:40:38,752
Let me and my boy here Cruzz
have a word.

477
00:40:54,312 --> 00:40:55,929
You going to ride shotgun.

478
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,116
No, Malik. Maybe you misunderstood
why I'm here.

479
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:01,711
Misunderstood?
- I'm here for an Introduction Malik.

480
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:03,430
Hell no, Cruzzer.

481
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:07,463
See, we'll be vouching for no fish,
when we was back in the yard.

482
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:10,436
You know how they work. We ain't talking
no hoe time Home.

483
00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:14,082
We in the streets.
That's three strikes, bro.

484
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:17,122
And 3rd strike will be
3rd strike for you my man.

485
00:41:17,123 --> 00:41:19,471
You better be convincing me
right now, or he's smoked.

486
00:41:19,497 --> 00:41:22,000
And we can act like none of this
ever happen

487
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:24,043
It's your call.

488
00:41:25,572 --> 00:41:28,196
For the first round,
I'll be going with you.

489
00:41:28,222 --> 00:41:29,945
We do it my way.
I say how it goes

490
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,846
What do you mean?
- I want to get paid today.

491
00:41:31,847 --> 00:41:33,684
OK, so I don't know if we have to
see your banker.

492
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,758
I don't care man, go rob a store.
But I need to get paid

493
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,132
Don't worry, you'll get your $ 10,000.
No $ 10,000 man.

494
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:41,851
We said $ 20,000 that what you said.
- And then what? You skip town on me?

495
00:41:41,852 --> 00:41:43,558
Blow the money?

496
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,040
So you come with me
on this first run, that's fine,..

497
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:47,960
..the moment it's done,
you'll get your other $ 10,000.

498
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:49,755
My word.
- Your word?

499
00:41:49,756 --> 00:41:52,857
Only reason this is going down because
I went on the line with you.

500
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:54,806
3 days ago man,
I was working a job.

501
00:41:54,832 --> 00:41:55,669
I was staying clean.

502
00:41:55,695 --> 00:41:58,349
I was doing everything I was
supposed to do. And now here I am.

503
00:41:58,374 --> 00:42:00,026
I'm back in.

504
00:42:00,027 --> 00:42:01,740
You think this is some
kind a thrill for me?

505
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:04,003
You just please take me my money.

506
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:09,493
You check them out with
them niggers at sandstone?

507
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:11,544
They say that Cruzz are solid.

508
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,067
He's on the main line like he said.
Soldering up

509
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:15,806
Putting word like good word should.

510
00:42:15,832 --> 00:42:19,051
Even had the keys to the yard
for a minute.

511
00:42:19,052 --> 00:42:21,404
That's the Cruzz I had known.

512
00:42:21,484 --> 00:42:24,517
What about other player?
Bong said he live in the suburbs.

513
00:42:24,518 --> 00:42:28,190
Fat crib. With a wife,
little girl.

514
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:30,733
He ain't  for hollow that for sure.

515
00:42:30,734 --> 00:42:32,765
He better not be.

516
00:42:33,566 --> 00:42:36,199
But he'll know with El Topo.

517
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,274
The new TV spot are testing really
well with the corp.

518
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:41,355
Then why am I down by five?

519
00:42:41,381 --> 00:42:43,538
Because the liberal think
you're a bitch.

520
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:45,797
Oh, maybe I should go to
a gay wedding.

521
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:47,569
Wouldn't hurt.
Oh, please.

522
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,072
You win 900 convictions last year alone

523
00:42:50,098 --> 00:42:51,973
It's a big volume to our core

524
00:42:51,974 --> 00:42:55,747
But to win this pliminary let's keep
our priorities.

525
00:42:55,748 --> 00:42:58,149
Your next meeting is checking in
down at security. - Who is it?

526
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,952
John Matthews.
I'll need a coffee.

527
00:43:02,094 --> 00:43:04,355
Let's go prep our schedule.

528
00:43:04,404 --> 00:43:08,123
<I>Man if I have a thousand pounds
I wouldn't be sitting in this dump right now. 

529
00:43:08,124 --> 00:43:11,882
<I>All I'm saying is, whatever you want to move
it won’t matters in my trucks.

530
00:43:11,883 --> 00:43:13,999
So I look at it as
business thing.

531
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,821
What do I have that they want.

532
00:43:15,822 --> 00:43:18,334
I'm impressed. You're a natural.

533
00:43:18,589 --> 00:43:21,231
You're luck he didn't rip you open, man.

534
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:23,263
He's a heavy hitters.

535
00:43:23,264 --> 00:43:26,708
Runs the entire Adams district now.
What's his jacket?

536
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:30,241
He earn his stripes on the corner as
a punk ass kid.

537
00:43:30,242 --> 00:43:33,683
Did a nickel for ADW,
3 more for distribution.

538
00:43:33,684 --> 00:43:36,225
Rival rob his bank last year.

539
00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:39,704
So they sending out as a posy
to do a drive by.

540
00:43:39,705 --> 00:43:42,576
He track them each down
and blood them out with a buck knife.

541
00:43:42,602 --> 00:43:44,522
Personally.

542
00:43:48,017 --> 00:43:50,303
Alright, I'm singing off.

543
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:52,491
Cooper is my witness.

544
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:55,121
We arrest Mr. Anderson

545
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:57,605
And I will reduce Jake sentence.

546
00:43:57,606 --> 00:44:01,400
Jason. - Right, sorry.
Jason's sentence.

547
00:44:01,401 --> 00:44:04,674
How much?
I'll cut it to a year.

548
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,655
Come on, I can't let 'em
get off scot free.

549
00:44:07,656 --> 00:44:09,997
And with the time that
he's already served.

550
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:12,685
Jason will probably be out in
6 months.

551
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:15,703
That is the best that I can do.

552
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:19,103
OK.
- Alright.

553
00:44:19,577 --> 00:44:21,879
Rock and roll.

554
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:28,898
She going to keep her word?

555
00:44:28,924 --> 00:44:31,819
Don't give her reason not to.

556
00:44:59,555 --> 00:45:02,818
Hi, daddy.
Hey, honey.

557
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:06,173
How long are you going away for?

558
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:07,958
Just 2 days.
That's it.

559
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:10,762
You know how much I love you Izzy?

560
00:45:10,788 --> 00:45:13,533
Come here.

561
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,891
Are you sure you have to go now?

562
00:45:16,892 --> 00:45:19,923
You know with everything going on
with Jason? Yeah, we need the contract.

563
00:45:19,924 --> 00:45:22,396
Specially after those new truck bought.

564
00:45:22,397 --> 00:45:25,682
Come on, Iz. Let’s go.
We got to go to school.

565
00:45:45,105 --> 00:45:48,576
You getting ready to go
out on one of those trucks?

566
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:52,915
How long are you going for?
- I don't even know where we're going to.

567
00:45:53,326 --> 00:45:57,035
It's good thing your boss is giving
you more responsibilities.

568
00:45:57,036 --> 00:45:59,729
It means he believes in you.

569
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,421
I'm proud of you.
Oh yeah?

570
00:46:02,422 --> 00:46:05,447
Yeha.
- It's a good thing.

571
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:12,254
I love you so much.

572
00:46:35,676 --> 00:46:37,590
Wires sent by your place.

573
00:46:37,616 --> 00:46:41,214
Do the same with your
warehouse when you're gone.

574
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,506
I heard you've done this before.
Undercover.

575
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,516
You have any advices?

576
00:46:58,558 --> 00:47:02,181
Just be yourself, John.

577
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:07,664
You try to be something you're not,
their bloodhounds will smell it right away.

578
00:47:09,216 --> 00:47:12,488
You're a family man, who's
trying to stay afloat.

579
00:47:12,952 --> 00:47:15,283
You have means they could use.

580
00:47:15,284 --> 00:47:18,656
That's it, you hide in plain sight.
Just keep doing what you doing.

581
00:47:18,682 --> 00:47:21,736
And they'll believe it.
Because it's the truth.

582
00:47:24,171 --> 00:47:27,364
Alright, audio is up.
Here we go.

583
00:47:29,277 --> 00:47:33,821

In here.

585
00:48:19,215 --> 00:48:21,782
Where're we going?
- El Paso, right by the border.

586
00:48:21,808 --> 00:48:24,349
It's over 1,000 mills.

587
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:27,752
What do you think?
we should go around the corner?

588
00:48:56,722 --> 00:48:58,410
If you don't mind me asking.

589
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:02,133
How long were you in prison?

590
00:49:02,195 --> 00:49:05,088
A little over a nickel.

591
00:49:05,768 --> 00:49:08,474
You never told me you have kids.

592
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,290
What are you doing man?
Just don't do that.

593
00:49:11,498 --> 00:49:13,398
You don't need to ask
me about my life alright,

594
00:49:13,524 --> 00:49:15,836
and I won't ask you about yours.

595
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:42,733
That guy say we're about 150 mill outs.

596
00:52:10,286 --> 00:52:12,333
I got it.

597
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,187
We got get this thing move.

598
00:54:42,188 --> 00:54:43,467
We can't.

599
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:47,043
Check my right.

600
00:54:53,387 --> 00:54:55,937
Whoa, stop!

601
00:55:02,287 --> 00:55:04,431
What're you doing?
Go. go, go.

602
00:55:22,099 --> 00:55:24,673
John, what are you doing?

603
00:55:52,564 --> 00:55:55,596
Matthews I sup in semi

604
00:55:55,597 --> 00:55:57,304
Is Torres mobile?
- Negative.

605
00:55:57,305 --> 00:55:59,336
We got local PD responding
two shots fired.

606
00:55:59,337 --> 00:56:02,092
Tell Torres to supersede PD.
No one sets foot in that yard.

607
00:56:02,118 --> 00:56:04,846
No one tips off Malik's suppliers.

608
00:56:04,847 --> 00:56:08,179
Torres, talk to me.

609
00:56:18,176 --> 00:56:20,320
Let's go. Let's go.

610
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,039
What the hell was that? - I don't know man.
We got to hide this thing.

611
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:30,510
No, we got to get back on the interstate.
Public, moving.

612
00:56:40,913 --> 00:56:44,769
<I>Yeah man. I'm sorry for your truck.

613
00:56:44,795 --> 00:56:46,620
Your driver.

Who's trying to jack?
- I don't even care man.

621
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:13,824

633
00:58:31,806 --> 00:58:35,580
Alright, There's a hidden
compartment behind the back seat.

634
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,177
Where are you going?

635
00:58:38,203 --> 00:58:40,679
Take a leak.

636
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:00,040
Yeah?

637
00:59:26,246 --> 00:59:28,749
Tell me you got a wire on that truck.
- In the dash and the back.

638
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,825
Sims, get that hell on too.

639
00:59:30,851 --> 00:59:33,539
I need Raven 1 over the following location.

640
00:59:42,844 --> 00:59:45,148
Who'd you call, John?

641
00:59:45,774 --> 00:59:47,689
I asked you a question.
Who'd you call?

642
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,561
My wife.
- Your wife.

643
00:59:51,562 --> 00:59:53,735
You expect me to believe that?

644
00:59:53,861 --> 00:59:55,821
Why don't you go ahead
and grape that beam for me.

645
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:59,201
I said grab that beam.
Turn your ass around and grab that beam.

646
01:00:00,785 --> 01:00:03,064
You playing me man?

647
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,186
John you need to know that this comes down
neither you or me.

648
01:00:08,212 --> 01:00:10,999
I will take your life.

649
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,623
I will shoot you where you stand.
Do you understand me?

650
01:00:15,635 --> 01:00:17,587
I'm going to ask you one last time..

651
01:00:17,588 --> 01:00:20,263
Who did you call?

652

01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,737
Don't you lie to me!
- That's the truth!

655
01:00:31,738 --> 01:00:33,882
You have a cell phone in your truck.
Why didn't you use it?

656
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:36,808
I wanted her to see the
caller ID from the warehouse.

657
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:39,879
So she believe that I'm
working my ass off.

658
01:00:39,905 --> 01:00:41,718
To save the company. That's the truth.!

659
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:49,325
You did this.
You did this.

660
01:01:36,101 --> 01:01:39,288

Alright, right here.

Just let them be out first, alright.

It makes easy when they got other plans.

01:05:00,683 --> 01:05:02,169
Hold to my signal

680
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:10,691
I got some people they
want to sit down and talk .

681
01:05:10,717 --> 01:05:13,215
a bit of serious baby.

682
01:05:13,216 --> 01:05:16,145
<I>Real serious.
- What?

683
01:05:17,861 --> 01:05:21,025
I'll let you know

684
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,570
And we're back to the yard, ain't it Cruzz?

685
01:05:30,823 --> 01:05:33,585
He's heading towards the exit,
what're you going to do?

686
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:42,233
<I>Let them go.
- Repeat.

687
01:05:44,746 --> 01:05:47,624
Repeat. Let them go.

688
01:05:51,563 --> 01:05:54,585
Let's go man. we're done,
let's get out of here. Let's go.

689
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:58,838
What are you looking at man?
- Just make sure they're gone.

690
01:05:58,839 --> 01:06:02,142
They're gone, dude.
What's with you?

691
01:06:02,143 --> 01:06:05,947
That stuff act's out.
Let's go.

692
01:06:48,868 --> 01:06:53,246
It's 11 o'clock. I thought you weren't
coming home for dinner. where were you?

693
01:06:54,683 --> 01:06:57,706
I was at work.
- No there's something going on.

694
01:06:57,732 --> 01:07:00,543
We're supposed to be an open book
remember?

695
01:07:01,229 --> 01:07:04,161
Is this about Jason?

696
01:07:04,332 --> 01:07:07,608
Please talk to me. I have no idea
what's going on.

697
01:07:09,747 --> 01:07:14,491
If I help them make arrest,
They'd reduce Jason's sentence.

698
01:07:15,022 --> 01:07:18,225
OK, how are you supposed to help them?

699
01:07:19,566 --> 01:07:21,858
By doing drug dealing.

700
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:25,307
Are you out of your mind?
You wanted to know.

701
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:27,348
People get shot and killed.

702
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:29,815
This is my son.
- You have more than one child!

703
01:07:29,816 --> 01:07:32,758
I'd do the same thing for her.
You know that.

704
01:07:32,759 --> 01:07:36,149
This is not my rule.
It's their rule.

705
01:07:36,175 --> 01:07:37,963
Which means that every move that I make,
or I don't make..

706
01:07:37,964 --> 01:07:40,706
..Jason will have to live like
10 years of his live.

707
01:07:40,707 --> 01:07:43,038
And what if you don't live?

708
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,610
Baby, have you thought about that?

709
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:48,674
You have family here too.

710
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:06,429
And I hope that I have your support
when the time comes.

711
01:08:06,851 --> 01:08:09,239
You're not old enough
to vote though are you?

712
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,533
John, my secretary said
you need to see me?

713
01:08:12,534 --> 01:08:14,808
You said all we need was either
Malik and drug in the same place.

714
01:08:14,809 --> 01:08:17,140
That's exactly what we had last night
We had a deal!

715
01:08:17,141 --> 01:08:20,651
We had it done.

716
01:08:20,652 --> 01:08:22,516
Calm down!

717
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:26,329
It's not just about you.
- Stop it.

718
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:28,501
Malik's supplier could be
our next exchange.

719
01:08:28,502 --> 01:08:32,225
Cooper made the call.  It's she right one
we go for the highest target.

720
01:08:32,636 --> 01:08:35,291
You just have to be patient.
Take the next meeting.

721
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:39,051
Your son will be alright.

722
01:08:39,052 --> 01:08:41,994
You had Malik single handily with tangy
and you let him go?

723
01:08:41,995 --> 01:08:45,057
He would've given up everybody.
- Bullshit..

724
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:47,028
I had to make a judgement.
TidaNo you didn't.

725
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:49,705
It's my call. And I will decide
exactly how this comes down.

726
01:08:49,731 --> 01:08:51,481
Do you understand?
It's that clear?

727
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:55,108
Crystal.

728
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:17,340
Hey, Sylvie.

729
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,979
They took what?

730
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:38,150
Manny, lend me your car bro.

731
01:10:03,112 --> 01:10:05,393
I came to visit Jason, but they wouldn't
let me see him.

732
01:10:05,419 --> 01:10:07,141
They said that he's
in the infirmary.

733
01:10:08,105 --> 01:10:11,129
What happened?
- He was assaulted.

734
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:13,275
They said he had
over 36 stitches.

735
01:10:13,301 --> 01:10:15,042
When they said assaulted...

736
01:10:15,043 --> 01:10:18,514
I don't know, they said they were
going to keep him in at least 2 more days.

737
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:21,809
And there's no way that
you and can even see him.

738
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,390
I'm trying here, right?
I talked to the lawyers at

739
01:10:24,416 --> 01:10:26,463
'Project Innocent' and they said
that they were going to use his case..

740
01:10:26,464 --> 01:10:28,581
It's not going to last that long.

741
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,722
I don't see you getting anywhere!

742
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,340
Oh, God..

743
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:38,180
Please don't do this to him.

744
01:10:44,431 --> 01:10:45,987
I should've known he was in trouble.

745
01:10:46,013 --> 01:10:48,319
I should've been able to protect him.

746
01:10:49,477 --> 01:10:52,091
This is nightmare.

747
01:10:56,853 --> 01:11:00,556
It's not your fault.

748
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:05,301
What's going on?

749
01:11:06,002 --> 01:11:07,364
You followed me here?

750
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:09,170
Who'd you visit?

751
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:13,649
It's my son.

752
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:17,621
Look man. He made a mistake.
His friends set 'em up.

753
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:20,354
They said if we cooperate,
we help him.

754
01:11:20,766 --> 01:11:24,258
You made a deal?

755
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:26,696
You got any idea what they're
going to do to us man?

756
01:11:26,722 --> 01:11:27,943
You have any idea?

757
01:11:28,953 --> 01:11:32,726
It's Malik man. It's the cartel man.
You know what they going to do to our family?

758
01:11:32,727 --> 01:11:35,576
It's my son. - Your son?
What about my son man?

759
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:40,193
I've got a son, John.

760
01:11:42,376 --> 01:11:45,348
You're a dead man, John.

761
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:48,882
You're dead man.

762
01:12:08,698 --> 01:12:10,348
Where's your mom?

763
01:12:10,774 --> 01:12:12,935
She's sleeping.

764
01:12:21,313 --> 01:12:23,286
Vanessa, what are you doing?

765
01:12:25,056 --> 01:12:27,913
Is this what you've
been doing, huh?

766
01:12:27,939 --> 01:12:28,917
Your work shift, huh?

767
01:12:28,943 --> 01:12:32,198
Can't even take care of
your own God damn son!

768
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:35,075
Vanessa, he's in the other room.
Look it's not what you think OK.

769
01:12:35,076 --> 01:12:37,878
Listen to me. It's not what you think.
Bullshit!

770
01:12:40,391 --> 01:12:42,416
You made me a promise, Daniel!

771
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:45,865
I stay cleaning,
you stay away from that life.

772
01:12:45,866 --> 01:12:48,938
Remember? - I understand baby.
But right now what I need you to do is...

773
01:12:48,939 --> 01:12:52,340
..I need you to pack a bag for you
and Anthony. You need to stay with your mama.

774
01:12:52,341 --> 01:12:54,139
You don't tell me what to do.
Not after lie..

775
01:12:54,186 --> 01:12:57,549
Enough OK? just...
Look..

776
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:03,162
I'm in trouble baby.

777
01:13:03,163 --> 01:13:06,104
I am in trouble baby.

778
01:13:06,105 --> 01:13:08,927
Please don't do that Vanessa.
Sweetheart..

779
01:13:08,953 --> 01:13:10,809
Wait,wait,wait.

780
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:14,774
I can't do it aging.

781
01:13:17,026 --> 01:13:19,558
I can't watch you go to prison or..

782
01:13:19,584 --> 01:13:22,441
or end up dead.

783
01:13:23,242 --> 01:13:25,551
That's not going to happen.
You hear me?

784
01:13:25,577 --> 01:13:27,531
I'm not going anywhere.

785
01:13:27,532 --> 01:13:30,287
Why do you do this to us?

786
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:32,873
Why do you keep doing this?

787
01:13:33,274 --> 01:13:36,909
I'm scared...

788
01:13:39,567 --> 01:13:42,069
I'm sorry..

789
01:13:55,773 --> 01:13:59,045
They just came right in.
Where's Isabelle?

790
01:13:59,046 --> 01:14:00,249
She's still at school.

791
01:14:00,275 --> 01:14:02,578
Get her, take her to your sister. Now!
Go!

792
01:14:08,495 --> 01:14:09,977
What are you doing here, Malik?

793
01:14:10,003 --> 01:14:11,816
I like your old lady.

794
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:16,472
She in a hurry, huh?

795
01:14:16,473 --> 01:14:18,145
What do you want?

796
01:14:21,287 --> 01:14:23,178
You want that paper, right?

797
01:14:23,259 --> 01:14:26,322
What about  Daniel?
- What about 'em?

798
01:15:21,064 --> 01:15:23,175
Come on man, El Topo wait.

799
01:15:23,176 --> 01:15:25,636
Only him.

800
01:15:56,790 --> 01:16:00,420
Arms up.

801
01:16:16,546 --> 01:16:19,017
You have a cell phone?

802
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:21,733
Yeah.
It no longer works.

803
01:16:22,592 --> 01:16:25,614
Anything else on you electronics.

804
01:17:17,725 --> 01:17:20,867
I understand your business
is in a complicated spot.

805
01:17:21,868 --> 01:17:23,769
Pretty hard to make money now a days.

806
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:26,573
It doesn't have to be.

807
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,798
When you work for us, you'll be
treated like family.

808
01:17:31,257 --> 01:17:32,904
Of course, includes your wife..

809
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:35,075
your child.

810
01:17:36,562 --> 01:17:39,214
I hear Isabelle is a beautiful girl.

811
01:17:40,005 --> 01:17:43,909
You and Annalisa are
really lucky to have her.

812
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:48,853
Thank you.

813
01:17:50,155 --> 01:17:52,627
You will make this next trip alone.

814
01:17:52,628 --> 01:17:55,139
Once you make the pickup,
You will take it to Mexico.

815
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:57,390
We will unload your construction supply

816
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:59,336
as well before you
cross back to the border,..

817
01:17:59,912 --> 01:18:02,286
..so everything looks legitimate.

818
01:18:02,287 --> 01:18:06,169
Palacio will pay you $ 250,000.

819
01:18:07,562 --> 01:18:10,324
All goes well, you will receive much more.

820
01:18:12,407 --> 01:18:14,699
Show us your loyalty.

821
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:18,672
And your future will be bright my friend.

822
01:18:36,849 --> 01:18:39,821
I will call you the day
after tomorrow 10 AM.

823
01:18:39,822 --> 01:18:41,884
With an address.
Be ready to leave.

824
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,863
What about Malik?

825
01:18:45,889 --> 01:18:48,135
You work for us now.

826
01:18:55,817 --> 01:18:57,885
Let's get one thing clear man.

827
01:18:57,911 --> 01:18:59,767
You still works for me.

828
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,533
Got it.

829
01:19:03,259 --> 01:19:06,145
Just handle your bin player.

830
01:19:06,578 --> 01:19:08,157
'Coz I ain't letting nobody

831
01:19:08,183 --> 01:19:10,096
getting me away me and my bread.

832
01:19:38,637 --> 01:19:42,111
John, are you OK?
- You're at Gaby's yet?

833
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:43,674
I'm in like 30 minutes.

834
01:19:45,014 --> 01:19:46,856
You can't go there now.

835
01:19:47,757 --> 01:19:50,749
<I>Why? - I need you to pull over
so we can talk about this.

836
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:54,198
No, tell me now.
What is happening.

837
01:19:54,224 --> 01:19:56,145
Is my sister in danger?

838
01:19:56,175 --> 01:19:59,560
Mommy, where are we?

839
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:05,821
<I>I love you, John. I do.

840
01:20:19,547 --> 01:20:21,959
They knew my wife and kids name. Dammit!

841
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,946
What did they knew about Jason?
- They don't.

842
01:20:23,947 --> 01:20:26,561
How the hell do you know that?
- Because from the moment we started

843
01:20:26,577 --> 01:20:28,561
this operation, we log you
separately into NATIS.

844
01:20:28,636 --> 01:20:31,321
What is NATIS?
Fed data base.

845
01:20:32,039 --> 01:20:34,863
Anyone who logs in to your case file
runs your name or Jason

846
01:20:34,889 --> 01:20:36,482
They notify me.

847
01:20:36,483 --> 01:20:38,137
They ran your name yesterday at noon.

848
01:20:38,163 --> 01:20:40,226
That's why they know about
Annalisa and Isabelle.

849
01:20:40,227 --> 01:20:43,699
And not Jason. - No, because he's listed
under his mother's maiden name.

850
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,931
And you don't have the same address.

851
01:20:46,232 --> 01:20:48,934
He's safe.

852
01:20:50,046 --> 01:20:51,713
Who'd you meet with?

853
01:20:52,539 --> 01:20:55,541
Malik called them El Topo.

854
01:21:07,472 --> 01:21:09,822
Who is he?
He's Juan Carlos Montero.

855
01:21:09,848 --> 01:21:11,783
They call him 'The Mole'.

856
01:21:12,317 --> 01:21:16,159
El Topo. He's ex-Mexican paramilitary

857
01:21:16,185 --> 01:21:19,520
and he runs this region
for the Nuevo LeÃ³n cartel.

858
01:21:19,521 --> 01:21:21,111
That's who he is.

859
01:21:21,112 --> 01:21:23,777
Yeah, and Pintero was seriously
crippling our organisation.

860
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:25,590
What did he say about the run?

861
01:21:26,951 --> 01:21:28,614
Just that there was another pick up.

862
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,754
And I got to take it to Mexico.

863
01:21:30,955 --> 01:21:33,136
What, in to Mexico?
Why?

864
01:21:34,358 --> 01:21:37,528
Because that means you're
running their money this time.

865
01:21:37,529 --> 01:21:39,902
You see John. One of the ways that we
fighting the cartel..

866
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:43,034
..is to stop them getting their profit.
Right now it's virtually

867
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:45,206
impossible for them to wire the money in..

868
01:21:45,207 --> 01:21:48,027
..so they have to physically transport it.

869
01:21:49,022 --> 01:21:51,079
Hundreds of millions of dollars.

870
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:53,335
This could be an
incredible opportunity for us.

871
01:21:53,436 --> 01:21:55,538
Especially if we got Pintero too.

872
01:21:55,639 --> 01:21:58,102
Can I talk to you for a minute?

873
01:21:59,542 --> 01:22:03,080
Yeah sure. John, would you
excuse us for a second?

874
01:22:03,716 --> 01:22:07,148
I'd appreciated it.

875
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:11,131
Thanks.

876
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:17,708
What? - You know damn well what.

877
01:22:17,709 --> 01:22:21,490
El Tope’s a game changer, and
he's way out of his depth.

878
01:22:21,754 --> 01:22:25,196
Are you kidding me? We can
still bring in Malik.

879
01:22:25,197 --> 01:22:27,098
No.
- We squeeze him for a 3rd strike..

880
01:22:27,999 --> 01:22:30,040
There's no way El Topo is going to be
at the exchange tomorrow.

881
01:22:30,041 --> 01:22:32,973
I am not missing this opportunity,
even if we don't get him.

882
01:22:32,974 --> 01:22:34,614
You know the way this works.

883
01:22:34,615 --> 01:22:36,371
You follow the drugs, you get players.

884
01:22:36,397 --> 01:22:38,878
You follow the money, you get a 'kingpin'.

885
01:22:38,879 --> 01:22:41,962
You know that if he crosses that border,
he's never coming back.

886
01:22:42,192 --> 01:22:45,225
You good with that?

887
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,270
John?

888
01:22:57,026 --> 01:23:00,989
Sit down. Drink?
- No.

889
01:23:01,801 --> 01:23:04,354
Coffee?
- No.

890
01:23:07,346 --> 01:23:09,819
We had a deal. I deliver Malik to you..

891
01:23:09,845 --> 01:23:12,024
..you reduce my sin sentence to a year.

892
01:23:12,025 --> 01:23:14,813
I'm really sorry. But we are
way past Malik now.

893
01:23:14,953 --> 01:23:17,265
If we pick him up,
we're going to tip off the cartel.

894
01:23:17,266 --> 01:23:20,927
And what about go to a judge?
- You can if you want to, but..

895
01:23:21,428 --> 01:23:23,323
..with the mandatory minimum laws.

896
01:23:23,349 --> 01:23:25,542
Judges has no say to reduce sentence.

897
01:23:25,543 --> 01:23:28,812
Only the federal prosecutor does,
and that's me.

898
01:23:29,557 --> 01:23:31,613
Look. This is the last stop.

899
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:34,361
You've been very patience.
I give you my word.

900
01:23:34,662 --> 01:23:38,365
Your son is coming home soon.

901
01:23:38,706 --> 01:23:41,437
Immediately.
- 'Scuese me?

902
01:23:41,438 --> 01:23:44,580
I go through with this, Jason come home
that instant.

903
01:23:44,581 --> 01:23:46,576
And I'll make sure that
every parents out there..

904
01:23:46,602 --> 01:23:49,301
knows how compassionate
you've been to my son.

905
01:23:51,729 --> 01:23:53,921
OK. You complete this.

906
01:23:53,947 --> 01:23:56,986
And I will have the judge
release your son.

907
01:23:57,504 --> 01:24:00,163
But, I need the money..

908
01:24:00,189 --> 01:24:03,014
..and the arrest of
the cartel player, nothing less.

909
01:24:09,896 --> 01:24:12,179
Hey, John. What time they calling you

910
01:24:12,205 --> 01:24:14,439
with the pickup address?

911
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,298
10.30. Tomorrow morning.

912
01:24:17,743 --> 01:24:21,521
The reason they pick Sunday,
is a high traffic day at the border.

913
01:24:21,522 --> 01:24:23,238
Less inspections.

914
01:24:23,264 --> 01:24:25,497
You don't think this is
a good idea, do you?

915
01:24:25,698 --> 01:24:27,562
Hey man. Don't matter what I think.

916
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:29,760
You made a deal with
the 'Dragon Lady', not me.

917
01:24:31,999 --> 01:24:33,571
John, you got to know there's a reason..

918
01:24:33,597 --> 01:24:35,650
..they pick you so quick for this run.

919
01:24:37,021 --> 01:24:40,144
Cartels don't use
wrong people to carry loads.

920
01:24:40,595 --> 01:24:42,076
They recruit..

921
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:44,231
..guys like you.

922
01:24:44,969 --> 01:24:46,671
Favourite target is a..

923
01:24:46,697 --> 01:24:49,098
middle class kid in a school.

924
01:24:50,574 --> 01:24:53,466
Make it sound all exciting to
carry your backpack full of dope

925
01:24:53,492 --> 01:24:55,779
for pockets full of cash.

926
01:24:55,789 --> 01:24:57,261
Then they do it.

927
01:24:57,962 --> 01:24:59,862
These guys threatening
to kill our family..

928
01:24:59,863 --> 01:25:02,100
They use them, they abuse them..

929
01:25:02,126 --> 01:25:04,762
They end up in a pool of acid.
That's it, they're gone. Done.

930
01:25:04,838 --> 01:25:06,930
Easy come, easy go.
Because there's always

931
01:25:06,956 --> 01:25:08,803
be another mule to
take their place.

932
01:25:10,453 --> 01:25:12,224
Brother you got to
know this is one

933
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:14,222
serious backpack
you're about to carry.

934
01:25:24,508 --> 01:25:28,019
Hello. I'm here to see my son.
He should be out from infirmary.

935
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:29,466
I see, under Matthews?

936
01:25:29,492 --> 01:25:31,053
Jason Collins.

937
01:25:32,654 --> 01:25:34,996
Just sign in.

938
01:25:40,241 --> 01:25:43,404
Go to window 4.
Thank you.

939
01:25:56,966 --> 01:25:58,738
Are you OK?

940
01:25:59,339 --> 01:26:00,578
I'm fine.

941
01:26:00,604 --> 01:26:04,369
God dammit. I can't keep letting
this happen to you.

942
01:26:04,654 --> 01:26:07,127
They said anything about moving you?

943
01:26:08,599 --> 01:26:10,846
How is everybody?

944
01:26:11,572 --> 01:26:13,439
Bagaimana Izzy?

945
01:26:13,643 --> 01:26:15,705
She doing alright?

946
01:26:22,291 --> 01:26:25,324
I've been wanting to tell you something.

947
01:26:26,665 --> 01:26:28,716
I'd admire you so much

948
01:26:28,742 --> 01:26:30,954
The stand you're taking.

949
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:34,212
You didn't take the easy way out.

950
01:26:34,813 --> 01:26:37,105
Not setting up one of your friends.

951
01:26:38,256 --> 01:26:40,949
I couldn't do what you did.

952
01:26:43,461 --> 01:26:45,269
So looks like you're the one..

953
01:26:45,295 --> 01:26:47,442
..teaching me.

954
01:26:48,436 --> 01:26:51,179
What real character

955
01:26:51,205 --> 01:26:54,213
and integrity is all about.

956
01:26:58,425 --> 01:27:01,248
I love you son.

957
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:03,944
I love you too.

958
01:27:20,567 --> 01:27:23,568
<I>Who is it?
- It's John.

959
01:27:25,982 --> 01:27:27,724
What are you doing here man?

960
01:27:27,725 --> 01:27:30,936
I park a few blocks away.
In case somebody's watching.

961
01:27:32,458 --> 01:27:36,401
Daniel, thank you for
not ratting me out.

962
01:27:36,602 --> 01:27:38,733
Believe me man, I've thought about it.

963
01:27:38,734 --> 01:27:40,680
If I don't go through with this.

964
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:43,547
They not going to release my son.

965
01:27:43,548 --> 01:27:45,243
What you don't understand man..

966
01:27:45,269 --> 01:27:47,591
You play nice with the feds man.

967
01:27:47,592 --> 01:27:50,664
But what happen when Malik and
everyone finds out that you're an informant?

968
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:52,364
What happens to me that
puts me right with you?

969
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:54,137
They know I'm a ratt.

970
01:27:54,138 --> 01:27:56,244
They will hunt us down man.

971
01:27:58,270 --> 01:28:01,009
They going to come after the families John.

972
01:28:01,185 --> 01:28:04,246
Daniel, I know I'm the one
who put us all in danger.

973
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:08,351
And I got to live with that.

974
01:28:08,562 --> 01:28:10,473
There is no way..

975
01:28:10,799 --> 01:28:12,625
..I'm going to let either side..

976
01:28:14,137 --> 01:28:16,016
..dictate our fates.

977
01:28:16,242 --> 01:28:17,356
No way.

978
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:57,427
<I>The address come through?

979
01:28:57,428 --> 01:29:00,530
Yeah, I know the area. It's going to take
about an hour and a half to get there.

980
01:29:00,531 --> 01:29:03,302
<I>The route is only 52 miles
west of your warehouse.

981
01:29:03,303 --> 01:29:05,334
It's still going to take
90 minutes in the semi.

982
01:29:05,435 --> 01:29:07,696
<I>No longer.
- Leaving now.

983
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:22,171
Both wire is loud and clear.

984
01:29:24,614 --> 01:29:27,306
Our guys is 20 miles out.
- OK.

985
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:15,658
He's been sitting there 15 minutes.
What's he doing? Shit.

986
01:30:15,923 --> 01:30:18,405
Alright, let's do a drive by.

987
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:40,190
Shit. Anybody hear anything?

988
01:30:40,216 --> 01:30:42,010
Voices? Struggle?

989
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:45,532
Where the hell are you, John?

990
01:30:51,539 --> 01:30:53,008
What took you so long?

991
01:30:53,034 --> 01:30:54,943
Just lost the DEA. We're on.

992
01:30:54,944 --> 01:30:57,311
Hey John. You sure
you pull this off, right?

993
01:30:57,437 --> 01:30:59,838
Not without your part, No.
I need that number.

994
01:31:40,752 --> 01:31:42,600
We counted every dollar.

995
01:31:43,626 --> 01:31:45,838
You'll be responsible for it.

996
01:31:49,317 --> 01:31:52,620
We can't triangulate the cell.
maybe it's turned off.

997
01:31:52,621 --> 01:31:55,623
Why would he just?

998
01:31:57,827 --> 01:31:59,852
What the address in Mexico?
- At El Paso..

999
01:32:00,178 --> 01:32:01,931
The main border crossing.

1000
01:32:02,032 --> 01:32:04,034
I will tell you which lane.

1001
01:32:04,035 --> 01:32:06,572
Only you are going to be in
that truck to avoid suspicion.

1002
01:32:06,573 --> 01:32:08,140
We're going to follow in the cars.

1003
01:32:08,141 --> 01:32:10,312
Once you've crossed, Nico Juarez they
going to direct you to..

1004
01:32:10,338 --> 01:32:12,570
..the final stop.
- Alright.

1005
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:07,015
I like them your tactics, Home.

1006
01:35:08,817 --> 01:35:11,420
Straight boom rush.

1007
01:35:14,723 --> 01:35:17,426
That's the Cruzz I know.

1008
01:35:17,427 --> 01:35:21,331
I need the number on El Topo bro.

1009
01:35:36,847 --> 01:35:38,792
I'm going to leave,..

1010
01:35:39,018 --> 01:35:41,551
..and I'm going to call 911 man.

1011
01:35:41,552 --> 01:35:45,255
Man, me and you both know
they're already on their way.

1012
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:14,050
Yeah? - You and I know if I cross into
Mexico, I'm a dead man.

1013
01:36:14,386 --> 01:36:16,317
So you think you better
off going alone?

1014
01:36:16,343 --> 01:36:18,414
Despite what you might think of me, John..

1015
01:36:18,490 --> 01:36:21,593
..I am your only protection on this.
yeah, maybe so.

1016
01:36:21,594 --> 01:36:23,568
But as many times you guys
change your game on me.

1017
01:36:23,594 --> 01:36:25,323
I had to put something in the play first.

1018
01:36:25,399 --> 01:36:26,425
Yeah, like what exactly?

1019
01:36:26,451 --> 01:36:28,927
You know my deal with Keeghan
was for the money and the boss.

1020
01:36:29,003 --> 01:36:32,006
Well, I'm going to make sure that
they happen on this side of the border.

1021
01:36:36,613 --> 01:36:38,815
Would you track the
