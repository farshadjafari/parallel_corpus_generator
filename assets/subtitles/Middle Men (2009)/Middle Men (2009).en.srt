1
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,341
I had several million dollars
in a duffle bag

2
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,094
and had to go and see a bunch
of low-life Russian mobsters

3
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,222
who would most likely
cut my throat, take the money,

4
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,392
and kill an innocent kid
just for sport.

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,061
It doesn't get any worse than this.

6
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,564
But I had no one
to blame but myself.

7
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:09,026
I'm the one who put myself
and my family in this situation.

8
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,363
See, life's all about choices,

9
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,867
choices we keep telling
ourselves are for the greater good.

10
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,035
But somewhere deep inside,

11
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,289
we know they'll lead
to a place like this.

12
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,916
And it wasn't greed
or ego that got me here.

13
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,586
I'm here because of what
I had a hand in creating.

14
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:29,297
It wasn't something that would change
the world for the better,

15
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,716
it wasn't something that would
put me in the history books,

16
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:35,386
make me a household name
or get me a statue in a park.

17
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:39,056
But I did have a hand in creating
the greatest invention of our time.

18
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,893
I inadvertently changed
the world as we know it.

19
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,064
My name is jack Harris and I figured out
a better way for guys to jerk off.

20
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,739
Never in the history of the world
have the merchants of obscenity

21
00:01:54,907 --> 00:02:00,328
had available to them the modern
facilities for disseminating this filth.

22
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,966
Men have been jerking off
since the beginning of time.

23
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,468
I mean, it's no secret.

24
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,428
Jimmy, I got your...

25
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,138
Oh, my God!

26
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,265
Why is this mother yelling at her kid?

27
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,685
She should know better.
Men are always thinking about sex.

28
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:28,606
About every ten seconds some sick,
perverted, degenerate thought

29
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,316
goes through a man's mind.

30
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,444
From the very moment a man figures out
his hand can reach his dick...

31
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,696
...he's figuring out
a new way to pull on it.

32
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:40,618
But what this country has truly lost
is its moral fiber.

33
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,955
Now, years ago, we had
heroes for our children.

34
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,623
This should come as no big surprise.

35
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,293
Every guy, gay or straight,
prince, pauper, kings,

36
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,462
heads of state, even presidents,

37
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,632
every last one of them is sneaking off
somewhere and whacking it.

38
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:59,428
This is the space shuttle.
It costs $450 million

39
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,557
every time it's launched by
Uncle Sam and your tax dollars.

40
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,434
Guess what's on it?
A billion dollar satellite.

41
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,603
And why do you think they're
launching that thing?

42
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,564
It's all part of the Internet.

43
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,150
But if you think it has anything to do
with helping your kids learn,

44
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,986
or Daddy reading stats on Tiger Woods,

45
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,656
or Mommy and Grandma learning how
to bake the perfect chocolate cake,

46
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,659
then you're out of your mind.
just follow the money.

47
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:26,205
The porn industry takes in over
$57 billion a year worldwide,

48
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,541
with no one ever admitting
that they watch.

49
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,713
This is going on every second
of every day, all over the world.

50
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:44,015
Gone are the days of trips to seedy
bookstores in the dead of night.

51
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,518
Or hiding in the adult section
of your local video store.

52
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,187
Or waiting for a plain
brown paper-wrapped package

53
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,731
to come in the mail.

54
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:55,985
Whatever you want to see is there
in your home or office, 24 hours a day.

55
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,361
And it's ready when you are.

56
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:01,908
Discretely, privately,
and in whatever flavor you choose.

57
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,873
Pure Americana.

58
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,043
No matter how many times I keep
rolling this over in my head,

59
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,004
I keep asking myself the same question:

60
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,215
How the hell did I let
things go this far?

61
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,512
Not that long ago,
things seemed so simple.

62
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,812
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

63
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,566
- What you got for me?
- I got you a little of everything.

64
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,735
- Looks good.
- I'm starved.

65
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,236
Me, too.

66
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,580
I can always tell your fried chicken
from everybody else's.

67
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,375
- Is that right?
- What's the secret?

68
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,086
A chef doesn't divulge her secrets.
You know that.

69
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,005
You can tell me.
It's not like I'm a stranger.

70
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,092
You marry me, I'll tell you.

71
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,732
Give me your hand.

72
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,360
Diana...

73
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,113
...will you marry me?

74
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,783
Pepper.

75
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,036
Pepper what? That's the secret?
Are you kidding me?

76
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,289
- Sorry you signed your life away?
- No.

77
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,543
I was one of those guys living
in a Norman Rockwell painting.

78
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:39,547
And looking back, I had no idea
how happy I really was.

79
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,259
Now across the gulf of space and time,

80
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,929
on another planet called Los Angeles,
California, two men were about to

81
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,808
have a conversation that would
change the path of my life forever.

82
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,785
Hey, how do you sleep
in a chair like that?

83
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:10,911
What?

84
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,039
How do you sleep
in a fucking chair like that?

85
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,708
Do you mean how do I sleep
with all your fucking noise over there?

86
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,169
You know there's nothing
to jack off to on the Internet?

87
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,171
Watch a video, you degenerate.

88
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,089
Oh, I'm a degenerate?
I'm a degenerate?

89
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,341
You're the one who bought
all the videos in the first place

90
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,887
- and I'm a degenerate?
- You've watched these 1 00 times.

91
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,223
That's why you need new shit.
Yeah, you're a fucking degenerate.

92
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,892
Fuck you.
Don't get all high and mighty.

93
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,019
Fuck me? Fuck you!

94
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,812
Why don't you stop
smoking all these cigarettes

95
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,105
and doing all this fucking coke!

96
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,691
I gotta work in the morning
and I can't sleep

97
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,278
- choking on all this fucking smoke!
- You smoke, you asshole!

98
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,616
Not when I'm sleeping.
And clean this place up.

99
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,202
It's like living
in a fucking toxic waste dump!

100
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,288
Oh, great. Now I get to live
with Martha fuckin' Stewart here?

101
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,706
If I was Martha fucking Stewart,

102
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:59,126
you'd be jerkin' off in front of me
all fuckin' day, you fuckin' loser!

103
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,881
Don't call me a loser.

104
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,966
Don't call me a fucking loser, bitch.

105
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,802
- You're a fucking loser.
- Don't call me a loser!

106
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,804
- Take it back!
- Don't you square off with me!

107
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,514
- I will kick your ass!
- Take it back!

108
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,933
You son of a bitch!

109
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,311
- Take it back!
- Fucking...

110
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,396
What these two idiots don't know

111
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,525
is that they're less than a year away
from being worth millions

112
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,026
and millions of dollars.

113
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,655
And turning the Internet
into what it is today.

114
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,406
Maybe I should go back even further.

115
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,202
Buck Dolby moved out to LA
only a couple of months earlier

116
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,912
to join Wayne Beering.

117
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,498
These two were childhood friends,
and like everybody else,

118
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,251
were trying to figure out a way
to make it big and get rich.

119
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,629
The only problem was that
they had no plan whatsoever

120
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,881
on how to make their dream come true.

121
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,926
Who could guess that would be
the perfect recipe for success?

122
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,595
As I was flying in here,
I noticed there was so much haze.

123
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:52,930
How do you deal with all this smog?

124
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,849
Oh, yeah, I don't really
go out that much.

125
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,058
Well, you have a job.

126
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,686
No, I've been collecting disability,
but it runs out in a few weeks.

127
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,271
- You hurt yourself?
- No, I fell.

128
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,357
- I told them I was gonna sue.
- What are you gonna do?

129
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:07,069
Oh, I don't know, but I feel
I'm on the verge of something.

130
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,488
Yeah? Me, too! I feel like
I'm on the verge of something.

131
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,283
It's like I got these ideas.
Theyjust keep rushing at me.

132
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,994
- Yeah.
- Like idea after idea after idea.

133
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,538
- It's like this waterfall.
- Yeah, it's like a cascade.

134
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:18,956
- Yeah, like...
- Yeah.

135
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,417
Like I said, they were idiots.

136
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,627
Well, that's not exactly true.

137
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,129
Believe it or not,

138
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:29,216
Buck was some kind of big-shot
rocket scientist at the age of 22.

139
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,802
He apparently has an IQ of 1 87,

140
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,513
although you'd never know it
talking to the guy.

141
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,767
Buck's favorite thing in the world to do
was spending weekends at NASA,

142
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,770
getting coked to the gills
and floating in space.

143
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,067
Needless to say, he got fired.

144
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,404
Sit. Sit. Sit.

145
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,407
From what I understand,
Wayne was a terrific veterinarian.

146
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:54,783
He even taught some classes.

147
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,119
- Who's the doctor here, you or me?
- You are, but...

148
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,164
The only problem was that he started
performing unnecessary surgeries

149
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,500
to ensure a steady supply
of canine barbiturates.

150
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,339
That pretty much ended
Wayne's career as a veterinarian.

151
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,799
- Good to see you, man.
- Yeah.

152
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,469
Do we have any, like, hook-up or like,
what's the gack situation?

153
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:14,929
Dealer's coming over tonight.

154
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,723
Now, I found out
a friend of mine in LA

155
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,309
who owned a night club was sick
and he couldn't work.

156
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,228
Apparently his family needed my help.

157
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,439
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, but he can't work for a while.

158
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,692
Susan called. She wanted to know
if you'd go out to LA for a few weeks,

159
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,444
help straighten out his business.

160
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:36,075
I spoke to a lawyer out there,
a guy named Jerry Haggerty.

161
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,702
He says the place could be
a real gold mine, baby,

162
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,163
but if you don't get out there soon,
that's it.

163
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,208
They're gonna lose everything.
I'm talking the lot.

164
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,836
I didn't want to leave my family
in Houston. We were happy.

165
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,631
Like everybody else,
we were mortgaged to the hilt,

166
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,927
had credit card debt and were constantly
struggling to make ends meet.

167
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,179
Not a great place to be with a family.

168
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:01,058
Besides, babe...
you're good at fixing messes.

169
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,559
Thanks, honey.

170
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,396
She was right. If I had one talent,

171
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:09,066
it was fixing problems, problems nobody
thought could be fixed.

172
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,734
I first learned I had this talent...

173
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,405
...several years ago, while I was
working for one of my dad's buddies

174
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,616
in the construction business.
This guy's name was Louie La La.

175
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,244
He was the leg-breaker
for a local crime boss.

176
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,912
Louie just loved what he did.

177
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,873
If he had a choice between being
President of the United States

178
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,667
and breaking somebody's legs...

179
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,502
- All right.
- ...guess what job he'd pick?

180
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,756
Let's go knee cap this Irish fuck
and get something to eat.

181
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,925
- Knee cap?
- Yeah.

182
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,721
Take a bat, couple of good hits,
the guy wises up real quick.

183
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,348
I wonder if you were to just,
you know, talk to the guy

184
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,184
and find out what happened.
He wouldn't not pay you, right?

185
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,270
I think maybe if you were
to just speak to the guy...

186
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,438
Kid!

187
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,524
- I am done speaking to this prick.
- I'm sorry.

188
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,402
I know you just wanna
get your money, right?

189
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,071
That's all you want,
is just get the money?

190
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,073
Yeah.

191
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:01,201
Hurry up, before I change my mind.

192
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,288
- I'm sorry?
- You got two minutes to get my money.

193
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,624
After that, somebody's
getting his knees broke.

194
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,465
He should have been a cowboy
or something. He's more suited.

195
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,634
So now I go inside the bar
and I meet this guy, Morgan.

196
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,220
He was scared and with good reason.

197
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,473
All right, I got problems, too.
You know?

198
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,143
Last couple of projects I built, I...
I got jammed up, you know?

199
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,187
So I had to go to Louie
which is the last fuckin' thing

200
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,646
I wanted to do, you know?

201
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,899
And now I'm waiting to go
to the fuckin' hospital. Why?

202
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,778
Because I owe? I mean, it's not
like I cheated or I stole or anything.

203
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,613
Just stop, all right, for a second?

204
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,657
Do me a favor.
Just let's focus on why we're here.

205
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,118
I mean, obviously when
you borrowed this money,

206
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,662
you had to have had a plan on how
you were gonna pay it back, right?

207
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,792
Let's just figure out what went wrong
and maybe I can get you out of this. OK?

208
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,502
Talk to me.

209
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,129
All right, if I...
if I had a building permit,

210
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,049
I could get the work
and pay him by the end of the day.

211
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,425
And how's that?

212
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,303
I could borrow money in a few seconds
if I had a building permit.

213
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,806
- Don't have a fucking building permit.
- A building permit?

214
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,058
Yeah. I need a fucking building permit.

215
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,519
Not this time. Batter up.

216
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,438
Hey, hold on, Louie.
Now, you got friends downtown, right?

217
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,190
I got friends all over the place.

218
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,609
OK, well, this guy says if he
can just get a building permit

219
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,277
he'll have your money
by the end of the day.

220
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,197
He wants me to do what?
What do I look like, a permiteer?

221
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,158
Look, do we want to get the money
or do we want to break this guy's legs?

222
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,619
I say we get the money, you know?

223
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,579
I'm in a quandary.

224
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,375
I learned that day you can
negotiate your way out of anything.

225
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,335
You just had to find
some common ground.

226
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,003
This is how you learn.

227
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,967
So I was on my way to
Los Angeles to help my friend,

228
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,761
a choice I made out
of financial necessity,

229
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,723
and one that would set in motion a chain
of events I never could have imagined.

230
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,016
Now about the same time...

231
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,520
...Buck had to get a job
in LA to help pay the rent.

232
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,156
Buck may have suffered
through the day,

233
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,116
but at night,
he and Wayne came alive

234
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,536
and began working on their master plan
to take over the world.

235
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,247
I am listening to you.
I am listening. I am listening.

236
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,000
What good is the Internet for
if it's not entertaining?

237
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,086
You know, there's nothing new.
There's... there's no variety.

238
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,047
I wanna see some hot porn.
What I'm seeing over here is boring.

239
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,883
What I'm seeing over here
is redundant.

240
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,426
What I'm seeing over here
is bullshit.

241
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:23,760
What's your fucking point? Just...

242
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,596
My point is we take some
pictures from a magazine

243
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,639
we scan them, we upload them
and we make a little money.

244
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,601
This has a lot of potential
for you getting really rich.

245
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,439
- Are you making fun of me?
- Let me get this straight.

246
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,274
- You go to the website...
- Are you making fun of me?

247
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,400
No, no, no.

248
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,278
You start your thing, right?
You finish, you clean yourself off,

249
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,655
you go to the filing cabinet,
take out your checkbook,

250
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,115
- write your check.
- No, it's like a subscription.

251
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,909
- Like a subscription to a magazine.
- Oh, really?

252
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,869
People do that all the time.
They send in checks.

253
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,787
Or go to the bank
and get a money order?

254
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,122
Call in their credit cards.

255
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,124
Who the fuck is gonna give you
their credit card?

256
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,459
- I don't know.
- Punch in the numbers?

257
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,587
- Why are you being so negative?!
- I'm not being negative!

258
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,422
There is no program for that.

259
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,216
People do it with magazines
all the time.

260
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,301
You swipe your credit card
in the fucking computer?

261
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,929
No, you dial it in. It's zeros and ones.

262
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,516
- Why are you being so negative?
- There is no program for this.

263
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,435
You punch in your numbers
on the fucking credit...

264
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,776
What's wrong with that?

265
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:26,865
What are you doing?

266
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,992
- Do not interrupt me for 1 5 minutes.
- OK.

267
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,662
Being a rocket scientist
had its advantages.

268
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,331
Within 1 5 minutes,
Buck had written the program

269
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,418
that is the standard today
for any online credit card transaction.

270
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:43,006
A technology that Visa, MasterCard
and Amazon had yet to develop.

271
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,342
So I hooked a buzzer up.

272
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,678
Every time we make a sale,
the buzzer will go off.

273
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,347
- How much you wanna charge for it?
- Ten dollars.

274
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,142
Why don't you make it $9.99?

275
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,145
Psychologically,
it makes people feel better.

276
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,819
OK.

277
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:07,698
So three or four days go by,
not a single buzzer.

278
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,201
My guess is they almost forgot
they even bothered to do this.

279
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,204
And then...

280
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,592
Did I just hear right?

281
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,888
Yeah, we just made $9.99.

282
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,058
At 4:1 5 in the morning?

283
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,145
Oh, God, the guy's gotta be
a pervert just like you.

284
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,731
You don't know that. This guy
could be on the East Coast

285
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,151
or in Europe somewhere,
where it's night.

286
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:48,614
This guy could be anywhere.
This is the World Wide Web, dumbass.

287
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,414
You're not fucking
with that thing, are you?

288
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,708
No, man. Those are subscribers.

289
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,086
We're getting rich.

290
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,717
Great.

291
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,302
How much are we up to?

292
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,220
Sir, I will be with you in a minute.

293
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,431
We passed the $2,000 mark
about a half hour ago.

294
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,100
- That's fucking amazing.
- Yeah, fucko.

295
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,186
All right, look, so I've
got this thing set up

296
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,397
so that we can tell what pics we're
selling based on the sound, all right?

297
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,608
So the buzzer is the trailer trash.

298
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,985
The chime is for the women over 40.

299
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,279
The whistle is for all
the big titty stuff.

300
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,240
And the bells...
are for the ass-fucking housewives,

301
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,117
- which is what you want.
- Why a whistle?

302
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,452
What do you mean?

303
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,996
Why the whistle for the big titty stuff?

304
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,457
I don't know,
I just thought that, you know,

305
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,418
when you see a woman walking down
the street with big tits, you whistle.

306
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,879
No, that's stupid. The bells
should be for the big titty stuff

307
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,965
- because tits are like bells.
- Tits are like bells? Since when?

308
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,134
- Yeah. Just change it.
- No, I'm not gonna change it.

309
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,136
Just fuckin' change it.
The tits should be for the bells.

310
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,304
The bells should be for the tits.

311
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,473
And the ass-fuckin' housewives
should be whistles?

312
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,475
- Yeah, what is wrong with that?
- That's stupid!

313
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,395
It's not stupid. When you stick
your dick in a chick's ass...

314
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,356
- She what? She whistles?
- Motherfucker!

315
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,943
Idiots. Two grown men
rolling around on the floor,

316
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,320
fighting over bells
and whistles like children.

317
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,905
Motherfucker!

318
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,449
Me? I didn't have that kind of luxury.

319
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,993
I was too busy in LA
setting up the nightclub.

320
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,038
My best friend james
came out to give me a hand.

321
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,998
It was pretty clear to us
that getting the place up and running

322
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,669
was gonna be an uphill battle.
But, like any other business,

323
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,964
we figured hard work and determination
would lead to success.

324
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,549
- Cheers.
- Good morning.

325
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,093
Am I hearing money?

326
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,728
Seems like ass-fucking
housewives is a big hit.

327
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,989
- We're past the $7,000 mark.
- Are you shitting me?

328
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,283
No, but I'm getting complaints
we need new content.

329
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,201
Why don't we just
buy some more magazines?

330
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,163
No, no, no. I think we need
to come up with some fresh stuff.

331
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,168
- Some stuff of our own.
- Oh, yeah?

332
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,795
How do you plan on doing that?

333
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,314
Remember the game plan.
Remember the game plan.

334
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,441
Buck and Wayne were
about to walk into a place

335
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,735
they didn't know
was owned by Nikita Sokoloff,

336
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,488
the head of the Russian mob
on the West Coast.

337
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,991
These two idiots were about to get
a lot more than they bargained for.

338
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,367
Hey, great to see you, man.

339
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,412
We wanted to know
if your boss was around.

340
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,538
We'd like to talk to him.

341
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,582
We've got a business proposition
we'd like to discuss.

342
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,627
- What is it?
- Well, we'd like to talk to your boss

343
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,254
or whoever owns this establishment.
This place is great.

344
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,673
- Not interested.
- Actually, I think your boss

345
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,260
would be really interested
in what we have to say.

346
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,637
Hey, hey, we've got to...

347
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,598
You OK?

348
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,935
- What's going on here, man?
- Come on, there's other clubs in town.

349
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,937
Relax. Let's get outta here.

350
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,688
What the fuck
are you looking at, bitch?

351
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,358
I've fucked guys like you in prison!

352
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,694
Come on, motherfucker!
Make my fucking day, bitch!

353
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,072
What the fuck are you doing?

354
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,115
OK, all right, all right!

355
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,868
Come on! I'm not fucking going...

356
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,846
Who the fuck are you,

357
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,598
to come into my place

358
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,308
and talk this kind of shit?

359
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,644
I'm telling you, we have
really good intentions, sir.

360
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,479
Look, what you need
to do is chill out and...

361
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,773
Shut up! Shut up.

362
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,609
I chill out...

363
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,823
- Put a bullet in your fucking brain.
- Oh, shit!

364
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,078
Why are you here?

365
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:11,543
We just wanted to take pictures
of your girls naked

366
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,338
and put 'em on the Internet
and split the profits with you.

367
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,429
Why you not say this?

368
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,021
Hey, hey, where are you going?

369
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,023
Come, come, come.

370
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,943
Come.

371
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,280
I told you we have
the best intentions.

372
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,867
- I'm gonna kick your fucking ass!
- Relax.

373
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,204
Within the hour,
Buck and Wayne actually believed

374
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,457
they were best friends
with the Russian mob.

375
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,209
They made a deal to give them
25 percent of their business

376
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,128
and to be partners for life.

377
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,756
Only I don't think they
quite understood the nuances

378
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,258
of being partners
with the Russian mob.

379
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,220
The next day, they run around
the strip club with a camera,

380
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,889
gathering video for their site.

381
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,599
Watch out, coming through.

382
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,060
We're gonna walk now,
but don't look at the camera.

383
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,728
Now!

384
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,870
Within a half a day,
Buck and Wayne were convinced

385
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,915
they were George Lucas
and Steven Spielberg.

386
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,513
Their website took off like a rocket.

387
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,432
They had to buy a new server
to handle all the business.

388
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,602
The mail, it was piling up and
they hadn't even begun to open it.

389
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,438
These two morons had no idea
what they'd created,

390
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,274
and even less of a clue
as to how to operate a business.

391
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,277
Within days, they were
working around the clock.

392
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,990
Don't dump the mail
on the coffee table! Get out!

393
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,452
The server's not gonna be here
for another four days. Fucking God!

394
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,706
I can't do this by myself.
You gotta quit your job, man.

395
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,465
You're fired, you son of a bitch!

396
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,134
You're fired!

397
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,472
- Well, the server problem's solved.
- You steal this?

398
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,142
No, I opened the mail.
There were checks in there, dude.

399
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,309
What?

400
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,228
They weren't bills, man.
We're going to Vegas!

401
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:38,940
So Buck and Wayne headed east
to the great city of Las Vegas,

402
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,859
to the land of hopes and dreams.

403
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:45,238
In less than a month, their business
was making about $25,000 a day.

404
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,991
More money than either one
of them could have imagined.

405
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,993
It should have been perfect.

406
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:53,663
But somehow, they'd figure
a way to screw it all up.

407
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,502
Now, for me, what started out as
helping a friend for a couple of weeks

408
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,504
had turned into a full-time business.

409
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,174
In no time at all,
we turned the place around.

410
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,634
james and I hit the streets,
promoted the club,

411
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,180
held events and before you knew it
there were lines going down the block,

412
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,766
and every night we
were packed to the rafters.

413
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,602
The thing is,
when you do good for someone,

414
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,271
they want you to fix
all their other problems.

415
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:21,274
There's always just
one more problem to fix.

416
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:24,736
I'm not sure yet. Believe me, I wish I
could be there, I just can't right now.

417
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,362
I know you're working hard. I just...

418
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,698
I feel like you're
missing so much, you know?

419
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,325
I know. Believe me, I know.

420
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:34,037
Hey, maybe I could sneak out
to LA for the weekend?

421
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,206
No, don't do that.
I'm actually in Vegas.

422
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,334
- Vegas? What for?
- Jerry Haggerty invited me out here.

423
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:40,710
Oh, God, Jack.

424
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,630
That creepy lawyer from the club?
He is nothing but trouble.

425
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,216
He's got some business venture
he wants to talk to me about.

426
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,884
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't have the club,

427
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,386
and that's turned out better than OK.
I mean, it saved my ass, honey.

428
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,473
He's as crooked as a dog's hind leg,
that one. You just be careful.

429
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:57,227
OK. I'll...
I'll just have a few laughs maybe.

430
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,146
What starts with laughter
ends in tears, big guy.

431
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,274
- I love you, OK? Bye.
- I love you, baby.

432
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,945
This fucking pro tells me, "Jerry,
you have to learn to hook the ball

433
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,405
because every great player
fights a hook."

434
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,325
Well, I'll tell you what,
I damn sure learned,

435
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,828
'cause everything I hit's
in the fucking woods.

436
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,914
Yeah, five strokes on my handicap.

437
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,127
Well, besides your golf game,
it seems like you're doing pretty well.

438
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,337
Oh, my God, I'm doing great, Jack.

439
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:28,424
I mean, for a guy who doesn't litigate
and refuses to wear a tie.

440
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:32,095
But I have some great, great ideas.

441
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,430
So, what kind of deal
do you have for me?

442
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,560
Well, I gotta tell you this story.
I mean, you won't believe it.

443
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,603
I get a call from a friend of mine

444
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:43,439
that there are these two guys holed up
in their suite at the Hard Rock,

445
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,275
in need of some legal advice.

446
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,861
They used my body like
a fucking bowling ball!

447
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,614
They started this business, but have
no idea what the fuck they're doing.

448
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,660
Now, a couple of months ago,
they make a whole bunch of money,

449
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,329
and they come out to Vegas.
They start partying for weeks,

450
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,374
and, from what I understand,
they go through a pound of blow,

451
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,002
hit every hooker in town and...

452
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,504
You know, basically
just pissed everything away.

453
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:11,384
- So who are their partners?
- A couple of Russian guys from LA...

454
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,803
- Nikita something.
- Sokoloff?

455
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,974
Yeah, I think that sounds about right.
You know him?

456
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,269
I mean, I know of him.
He's supposed to be a lunatic.

457
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,937
Yeah?

458
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,482
Party over.

459
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,611
You new here? What's your name?

460
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,155
They were kicking the shit
out of these two numb-nuts

461
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:35,325
because they couldn't pay up
like they were supposed to.

462
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,619
So beautiful.

463
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,663
Why are afraid of me?

464
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,667
So, what kind of business is it?

465
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,045
That's the best part.

466
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,881
Seems like these two morons,

467
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,176
what they did was they collected
a bunch of these dirty pictures

468
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:54,594
and they put them on the Internet.

469
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,679
I'm telling you,
within a couple of months,

470
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,848
they make over a million dollars.

471
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:04,771
Yeah, it's just the thing is,
I got a wife, I have children.

472
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,981
I have no interest in getting involved

473
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,691
in the porn industry,
you know what I'm saying?

474
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,402
I got it, but let me ask you a question.

475
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:18,534
Steve Wynn, Barron Hilton,
are they pornographers?

476
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,828
- No. Why?
- Know why?

477
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:25,541
Because they got that shit playing on
every TV in every one of their rooms.

478
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,629
You can't name a hotel chain that
doesn't make a ton of money off porn.

479
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:33,049
- I mean, are they pornographers?
- I mean, I see what you're saying.

480
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,969
Well, but I'm not asking you
to make a porn movie.

481
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,972
I'm just asking you to straighten out
a business situation.

482
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,391
Haggerty, he always had an angle.

483
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,393
He was probably looking
to steal the business

484
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,853
as soon as I straightened
out the Russian problem.

485
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,231
If this was real
and I was going to be involved,

486
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,191
Haggerty couldn't be a part of it.

487
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,069
...make a little money!

488
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:58,074
He had Feds all over him for some scam
he'd run and he stunk of desperation.

489
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,576
- Welcome back to the Hard Rock, Jack.
- How you doing? Thanks.

490
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,996
- What suite?
- The Penthouse.

491
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,374
From what Haggerty told me, I knew
there was a lot of money in this deal

492
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:10,086
and that was good. The money
was in porn, and that was bad.

493
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:13,172
Why I even knocked on the door
is beyond me.

494
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,556
How you doing? Jack Harris.

495
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,182
- Buck Dolby.
- May I?

496
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,226
- Please.
- Thanks.

497
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,733
- Why are you here?! Who sent you?
- I'm sorry, Jack. I'm sorry.

498
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,609
- Why are you here?
- No, no, no, he's OK.

499
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,154
How do you know what they look like?
This is not what we agreed on!

500
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,073
This is not what we talked about.
He's not part of the circle!

501
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,617
This is part of the agreement
because I checked him out.

502
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,828
Yeah, bullshit!
I know why you're here!

503
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,788
Look, we gotta get the fuck
out of here right now.

504
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:50,001
- OK, just... I'll deal with him.
- Gotta get the fuck outta here.

505
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,546
- He seems high-strung. Should...
- I'm sorry. He's off the rails here.

506
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,632
Hey, hey! I got my eyes on you, bitch!

507
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,302
Thank you for coming.
Would you like a drink?

508
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,470
I'm OK.

509
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,639
First and foremost,
I would like to apologize

510
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,559
for the cleanliness
and hygiene of this hotel suite.

511
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,311
- Don't worry about it.
- Oh, man.

512
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,229
You know, he's been up
for five straight days.

513
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,274
I called a doctor...
He won't let anybody up.

514
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,069
You gotta get out of here right now,
but you can't use that front door.

515
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,779
Why don't we try and get
some food in him, OK?

516
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,990
- I'm gonna give room service a call.
- We're afraid we're gonna get cracked.

517
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:24,327
- You mean whacked by the Russians?
- Yeah, yeah.

518
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,788
I gotta tell you something
about myself you don't know, OK?

519
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,874
I'm a multi, multi, multi-millionaire.
I'm an American entrepreneur.

520
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,835
The irony right now is that
I feel like an anaphylactic polar bear

521
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,838
with a bunny rabbit shoved up his ass.
I'm not gonna explain it to you.

522
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,840
It's just that thing, money,
money, money, money.

523
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,592
Everybody's trying to get
to that bunny rabbit.

524
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,011
We owe them a considerable
amount of money.

525
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,222
- I understand.
- But we figured what's the rush, right?

526
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,349
I mean, we're all friends.
I mean, I'm half responsible

527
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,393
for the substance abuse indulgency

528
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,354
and that's part of the problem
that we overlooked.

529
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:55,108
Here's the thing. I know for a fact that
man back there is posing as a doctor,

530
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,611
when the truth is, there's five guys
out front with a black hood,

531
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,781
they're waiting to kidnap me. They
wanna take me to liquefy my accounts

532
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,700
and they're gonna shoot me
in the head, execution-style.

533
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,119
I'm not gonna let that happen to you.

534
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,038
They made their presence felt
about five days ago,

535
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,291
where they kicked the shit out of us.
I mean, they bum-jacked us pretty good.

536
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:17,547
I mean, they got my eye, as you can see,
but, like, they really hurt Wayne.

537
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,884
- They hurt him real bad.
- Listen, here's the thing.

538
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,762
You can take me, but I'm not
gonna let you take River Dancer.

539
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,306
She stays, all right? All right?

540
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,225
Listen, listen...

541
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,519
- Do you see what I'm dealing with?
- Tell you what.

542
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:35,148
Let me try and get her out of here.
You look after him. We'll go from there.

543
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,816
- That sounds good.
- I love you.

544
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,068
- I love you. I do.
- No, you don't.

545
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:40,695
- Don't touch me.
- I love you.

546
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,489
- No, you don't. No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. I do.

547
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:46,909
- You do?
- I do. I do.

548
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,661
Look, I love this guy
like a brother, all right?

549
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,246
I mean, I hate him, but I love him.

550
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,749
Rachel, you remind,
you remind me of my mother.

551
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,418
Yeah? My name's Jessie.

552
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,420
Yeah, my mother's name was Brenda.

553
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,005
Oh, you know you can't go there, Wayne.

554
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:00,923
- That's not good.
- She used to hit me out of my skin.

555
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,009
Come on, come on,
come on, let's sit here.

556
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:05,386
Hey, why don't you grab your stuff?
I'm gonna get you out here, is that OK?

557
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,930
- I need to get paid.
- Sure. I'll take care of that.

558
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:11,809
- Whoa, you've got a halo on your head.
- Just look at my eyes.

559
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,188
Yeah. I don't wanna believe
in the circle anymore.

560
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,901
He seems to be doing a little better.
How do you feel?

561
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,487
- I've had a couple days rest.
- Is your eye OK?

562
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,779
It's OK, but...

563
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,907
You just gotta take care
of the Russians.

564
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,619
I don't gotta do anything, OK? I just
want to understand what's going on.

565
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,496
I want to figure out
what you two did right.

566
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,916
Obviously it was something because you
made a million bucks in two months.

567
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,627
I already know what you did wrong,
you didn't pay off your partners.

568
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:41,964
But so far as I can tell, you guys have
a solid idea, you just got overwhelmed.

569
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:45,259
You got in over your head. And maybe
you don't know how to run a business.

570
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,470
- But you do, right?
- Yeah, I do.

571
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,222
Well, will you do that for us?

572
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,433
Look, I have no interest
in making a living creating porn.

573
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,228
I have a family.
I don't wanna be a pornographer.

574
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:59,482
So if I come onboard, I want this to
be a legit business. A hundred percent.

575
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,484
I understand.
I couldn't agree with you more.

576
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:02,985
So now, you guys can help me.

577
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,655
You two have figured out a way
to take a credit card

578
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,074
from somebody anywhere in the world,

579
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:10,409
and deliver a product
anywhere in the world,

580
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,703
and neither side ever sees each other?

581
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,580
- That's correct.
- And that was your idea?

582
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,250
- Yeah.
- Well, that's a great one.

583
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,126
And that's a way
to make money long term.

584
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,504
We just need to figure out
a way to facilitate a transaction

585
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:22,672
between the two parties.

586
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,674
That's where I lost you.
What do you mean by that?

587
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,385
- I don't understand this bullshit.
- All right.

588
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:32,056
Imagine you got a basement...
anywhere in the world.

589
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,766
Down in this basement,
you got a couple guys

590
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,685
with cameras and some girls.

591
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,436
How about they're Asian girls?

592
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,356
Fine, Asian girls.
Are you with me so far?

593
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:44,318
Imagine you're a guy that likes
to watch Asian girls online.

594
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,861
Are you gonna give
your credit card number

595
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,905
to some pornographer in Thailand?

596
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,992
And what would it show up as
on your credit card statement?

597
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,536
The divorce rate is high enough
in this country,

598
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,746
without wives opening up
the monthly statement

599
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,165
and seeing that their husband
bought something like

600
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,376
FilthyAsianWhores.com.

601
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,879
We could have hundreds of sites,

602
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,549
maybe even thousands,
all under some nondescript name?

603
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,884
Exactly, and if I'm a customer

604
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,137
and I get my credit card statement
at the end of the month

605
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,306
- and it says something like...
- BigTits.com.

606
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,391
Right. I might have
buyer's remorse because

607
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,811
my wife's not gonna be very happy,
but if it says something like...

608
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,855
- ...24/7 Billing Company...
- I like that.

609
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,691
...nobody knows what that means.
It's safer for everybody involved.

610
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,444
It's a win/win situation.
The consumer gets what they want,

611
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,029
the content provider get what they want,

612
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,740
and we make ten percent
by handling the transaction.

613
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,241
We're just the middle men.

614
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:36,746
So we take a cut from the people that
are already out there making this stuff,

615
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,414
- wherever they are.
- Right.

616
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,333
Oh, my God!

617
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,379
That's... that's limitless.

618
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,590
I mean, that is
an insane amount of money

619
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,508
- we're talking about right now.
- Potentially.

620
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,095
It could have no downside. I mean,
except for your Russian partners.

621
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,972
Yeah.

622
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,392
OK, so how do you think
Haggerty fits in?

623
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,315
- I'm not so sure about Haggerty.
- Why? He put us together.

624
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,859
I mean, that'd be kind of shitty
to cut him out now, don't you think?

625
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:09,779
Haggerty's gonna be
indicted any minute now, OK?

626
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,114
He's got federal agents all
over him pretty much all the time.

627
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,282
That's the truth.

628
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,867
He didn't tell us
he was gonna be charged.

629
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:18,454
Yeah, well, I just think this business
is questionable as it is,

630
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,791
and it would be unwise to team up
with somebody who is under indictment,

631
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,710
unless you want Feds all over you, too,
which I don't think you do.

632
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,922
No. I think what you're saying
makes sense. I just feel...

633
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,926
I don't know, not right about it.
You know? The guy's saving our life.

634
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:37,598
Yeah, well, I'd be the one
dealing with the Russians, OK?

635
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:41,394
It wouldn't be Haggerty.
It would be me. I'd be the one at risk.

636
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,231
The next morning, I flew back to LA.

637
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:49,151
I made a deal with Buck and Wayne that
we wouldn't provide a frame of content.

638
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,153
We were just gonna be the middle men.

639
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,448
And then I did the right thing.
I took care of Haggerty

640
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,742
after pulling a favor from
my buddy at the Hard Rock.

641
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,246
- So, what's this?
- That's $200,000. Now, you're out.

642
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,081
Wait a... wait a minute.
Excuse me. I'm out?

643
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,541
Yeah. These guys are lunatics.

644
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,376
Wanna take care of them?
Gimme the money back.

645
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,753
- Wait a minute. Just hold it.
- What's it gonna be, Jerry?

646
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,133
Nice. I'll... I'll take the money.

647
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,843
- Yeah? Great.
- I'll take it, yeah.

648
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,346
After I had Haggerty taken care of,

649
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,849
I had Buck and Wayne
have the Russians call me.

650
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,851
They said they owed $400,000,

651
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,688
so I pulled 450 to avoid
any bad feelings in the future.

652
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,023
The deal was, I'd be out in a year.

653
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,359
I figured with the potential
of the business,

654
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,528
I'd make enough money in that time
to provide for my family...

655
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,739
...for the rest of our lives.

656
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,826
Within an hour, some big
Russian named Ivan was at my door.

657
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,083
Ivan, Jack Harris.

658
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,796
Can I get you a drink or anything?

659
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,673
I'm not here to socialize.

660
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,800
OK, I'm just trying to be friendly.

661
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,844
I'm not your fucking friend.
Where's my money?

662
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,805
Your money?
I thought this was Nikita's money.

663
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:04,393
My uncle. Family money, our money,
that these two shitheads owe to us.

664
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,771
You pay this to me, or...

665
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,901
...maybe I take little boy
on boat trip, huh?

666
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,497
Or... maybe I speak out of turn.

667
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,918
Let's... let's focus on why we're here.

668
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:34,256
Here's the cash. Feel free to count it.
It's all there.

669
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,929
That's everything they owe you,
plus 50 for your troubles.

670
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,556
OK. OK, this is good.

671
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,392
This is good. We make deal.

672
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,022
- No!
- Fuck! James! Jesus.

673
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,859
He threatened Michael.
I couldn't let that go.

674
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,489
Good punch. Boom.

675
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,449
It's good. Good, very good.

676
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,743
Now, everybody is friends.

677
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,119
Come, come, come.

678
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:08,666
It's OK. No, no, no.
No, no. Come on. It's OK.

679
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,797
You come, we drink.
What, you don't drink?

680
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,466
Boom. Boom.

681
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,973
Could you do me a favor,
call your uncle first.

682
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,475
Just let him know everything's settled.

683
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,646
It is not necessary.
I am happy, he is happy.

684
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,773
No, I understand.
It's just, it's a lot of money.

685
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,733
I'm sure he'd like to know
that it's been collected.

686
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,778
And I know it would help my partners
sleep a little easier at night.

687
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,658
Thanks. I'll pour you a drink.

688
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,418
It is machine.

689
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,670
I'll give him a try later. Thanks.

690
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,176
Where is he?

691
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:06,348
You, you. Look at you. I like you.

692
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:11,270
I like you. You, you make me laugh.

693
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,523
Look, look at him.

694
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:17,484
He is like puppy. Puppy.

695
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,787
Jesus Christ. Fuck, is he dead?

696
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,874
You're not a doctor,
maybe he's not dead!

697
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,251
I'm not a doctor, but I can tell
you this motherfucker's dead.

698
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,669
How fucking hard
did you punch him?

699
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,047
I don't know, Jack. I punched
him like I always punch 'em.

700
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,720
- I'm sorry, Jack.
- You're a murderer.

701
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,181
What are we gonna do now?

702
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,345
What are we gonna do?

703
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:30,683
We're not gonna do anything. We don't
mention this to anybody ever. All right?

704
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,935
- What about the money?
- We gave it to him.

705
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,603
The guy's dead. What do you...?

706
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,272
He... he's floating down at
the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

707
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,775
Right, but they don't know that,
so that's how we need to keep it.

708
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,027
- Understand, Wayne?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

709
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,862
They were supposed to get
the money three hours ago!

710
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,823
- They didn't get their money!
- We gave him the money.

711
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,242
He disappeared with it.
End of story. Right?

712
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,577
But what if they still want it?

713
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,579
We do what we'd do in that situation.

714
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,999
We tell them to go fuck themselves
'cause we paid 'em.

715
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,458
- It's not our problem.
- No, no, no, no.

716
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,293
You need to wake up
and come to school, all right?

717
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,462
What you're gonna have
to do is go out

718
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,757
and buy a GLOCK nine millimeter
and sleep with it under your pillow.

719
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,426
- Wayne...
- Otherwise, you're gonna wake up

720
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,137
with your asshole
choking up on a baseball bat.

721
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,473
- Wayne!
- It's true, Buck! It's true, Buck!

722
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:14,643
- Jesus Christ.
- I say we just pay 'em.

723
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,311
You want to pay 'em twice?
Does that make sense?

724
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,772
- We didn't pay the first time!
- Right, but they don't know that!

725
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,940
You're a dick!

726
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,609
If we're too eager to pay again,
they're gonna know something's wrong.

727
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,611
They're gonna know we did
something with him. Understand?

728
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,948
How do you figure that?
You just pay them and they go away!

729
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,576
Look, I've tried to make it
as simple and as clear

730
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,746
as I can to you guys, all right?
I'm done talking about it.

731
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:37,166
We're all accessories to murder,
you understand? Sit down!

732
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:41,795
- Hey, sugar!
- Hey.

733
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,715
- Oh, sweetie.
- Dad!

734
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,008
- Hey, buddy.
- Dad!

735
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,010
You're back!

736
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:56,268
- Hey, you OK?
- I'm OK. I just missed you, that's all.

737
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:57,978
Here you go. Will you hold these?

738
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,564
- Oh, will you hold this?
- Yeah.

739
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,025
You can't eat those!

740
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,694
- You can't eat those, honey.
- Hi. Will you grab my bag, Michael?

741
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,867
- OK, let's go get something to eat.
- Yeah? Where you wanna go?

742
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,660
Wherever you want.

743
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,414
Yeah, look at the pretty
green one. Look.

744
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,463
You OK, baby doll?

745
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,215
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

746
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,549
Yeah.

747
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:30,010
It's so nice to have you home.

748
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,518
Mom, what do fish eat?

749
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,853
Some eat plankton,
some eat other fish.

750
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,064
They pretty much eat
whatever's around.

751
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,441
Look, have one of these.

752
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,332
You're awake, aren't you?

753
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,543
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

754
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:07,923
I know you better than
you know yourself, mister.

755
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,303
What is it, baby doll?

756
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,974
It's just work stuff. It's OK.

757
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,101
- You sure?
- Yeah.

758
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:20,394
Yeah?

759
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,400
You know, I gotta go back out there
for a couple of days.

760
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,026
No.

761
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,654
I'm sorry, it's just,
it's a new business.

762
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,826
As soon as I get it up and running,
I'll be home all the time, OK?

763
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:39,121
I promise. OK?

764
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,708
So, what kind of business is it?

765
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,460
It's like I told you, honey,
it's an Internet business.

766
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,921
Yeah, I know. What kind?

767
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,175
Oh, like a billing service.

768
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,136
- Oh, yeah? What for?
- What do you mean?

769
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,763
What do you bill people for?

770
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:01,476
Just, you know, just entertainment.

771
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,396
Oh, yeah? What kind of entertainment?

772
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,482
Like movies

773
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,695
and just pictures of different stuff.

774
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,823
Hey, maybe you can get some free
movies, bring 'em home for Michael.

775
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:19,870
It's weird. I feel like
you're not telling me something.

776
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:24,291
OK, fine. Adult movies.

777
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:30,172
- Oh, yeah? OK.
- I'm not joking.

778
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,841
Come on, sweetie, you gotta go.
Be serious.

779
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:36,178
- I'm serious, Diana.
- What?

780
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,430
What do you mean, adult movies?

781
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,641
Relax, I'm not making
porn movies here.

782
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,477
It's an Internet billing service, OK?
That's all.

783
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,771
Internet billing service?
I... What...?

784
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:48,190
I don't even know what...
I mean, what does that mean?

785
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:50,275
You bill people on their computers?

786
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:51,985
Yes, Diana, computers.

787
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,696
OK, right. Yeah, good. That's the
stupidest thing I've ever heard.

788
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,949
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I think it's the gold rush

789
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,868
and it'll have us set up
for life in less than a year. OK?

790
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,621
And you're right, I do have to go.
I gotta go, babe.

791
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,540
You don't get to walk out
on this kind of conversation.

792
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,001
I gotta catch my flight.
Honey, OK, take it easy.

793
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,462
No. Hey, hey, hey! Listen!

794
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,215
This is completely crazy and disgusting.

795
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,884
I don't want you being part of it.
I don't want you being a pornographer.

796
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:17,886
OK, so Steve Wynn and Barron Hilton
are pornographers

797
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,389
because they have these films
in every one of their hotels?

798
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:24,685
I don't care about them, baby.
Listen. I care about you.

799
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,812
OK, well...

800
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,606
Little did she know
it was already too late.

801
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:33,110
I couldn't back out now.
I mean, I could just imagine the damage

802
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,112
that Buck and Wayne
would do on their own.

803
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,990
They were the kind of guys
who'd get pulled over for a DUI

804
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:41,201
and start confessing to some
motorcycle cop about the murder.

805
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:44,913
I had to keep an eye on them somehow
or I'd end up arrested, or worse yet,

806
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,082
dead by the hands of the Sokoloffs.

807
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:52,045
So I go back to LA with my wife's
words rolling around in my head.

808
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,672
What's happening?

809
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,717
I'm not in town two minutes and...

810
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,848
I don't like this.

811
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:05,851
- It's OK.
- I'm telling you, I don't like this.

812
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,564
I'm gonna go with them. I'll see you
guys back at the house. It's all right.

813
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:14,776
I knew that if I didn't play this
perfectly, I'd be joining Ivan.

814
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:15,944
We need to talk.

815
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,198
Look, don't take this the wrong way,

816
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,118
but I'm guessing you guys
didn't do this just to be nice.

817
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,579
Tell me about Ivan.

818
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:28,206
Ivan? What about him?

819
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,625
What happened exactly?

820
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,962
I'm sorry.
What happened with what?

821
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,381
Was he at your house?

822
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,258
Of course he was at my house. Why?

823
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,969
And? What happened?

824
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,137
Nothin' happened.

825
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,807
I paid him, we had a few drinks,
we had a few laughs, and he left.

826
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,979
Nikita, you wanna...
you wanna tell me what's going on?

827
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,817
Ivan never got home.

828
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,945
I don't know what to tell you
about that. Maybe he's off partying,

829
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,991
but I paid him 400 grand,
plus 50 for your troubles.

830
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,327
- What?
- Four-fifty. I gave him 450.

831
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,245
The figure was 200.

832
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,585
Well, that's not what he told me.

833
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,504
Hey, hey, hey,
what you fucking saying?

834
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,381
I'm not saying anything, all right?

835
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,508
What's he saying by
disappearing with your money?

836
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:22,552
No offense here, but it's sounding to me
like you might have gotten ripped off.

837
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,393
- Fuck you.
- What the fuck you doing?

838
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:32,854
- They're getting away!
- I got 'em!

839
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:40,070
- James!
- Shit!

840
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:42,489
Motherfucker!

841
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,282
You moron!

842
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,224
Jack, last time.

843
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:11,893
What happened between you and Ivan?

844
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,980
Look, Nikita, I can tell
you the story a million times

845
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:17,315
and it's not gonna change.
It's the truth.

846
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,902
He comes to the house
and I pay him. All right?

847
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,279
He ripped us off,
do you understand?

848
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:29,077
Nikita, wake up! What are you gonna do,
kill me? I'm your partner!

849
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,371
You're gonna kill me
for some shit I didn't do?

850
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,832
What are you gonna do
when Ivan shows up?

851
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,834
You're gonna realize
how much fuckin' money you lost

852
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:38,587
- because you fuckin' killed me!
- Let him go!

853
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,048
Down, down!

854
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:51,099
- Put the gun down! Put it down!
- Would you like to try?

855
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,894
- Come on, Nikita.
- Come on, it's OK.

856
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:58,440
Nikita. I want you to focus
on why we're here, all right?

857
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:00,901
This is about money.
Just give me a number.

858
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,279
Give me a number that
makes this work. All right?

859
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:09,951
Double my end, pay every month.

860
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,120
No matter what. No excuses.

861
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:16,791
But if I find out you lied to me...

862
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:21,588
...I'll kill you, your family, friends,

863
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:25,050
people you haven't even met yet.

864
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:29,304
- We understand each other?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

865
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,307
Good.

866
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:59,125
What I was most afraid
of wasn't dying.

867
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,337
It was the thought of leaving
my children without a father.

868
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,596
Now, I had no choice
but to work, and to work hard.

869
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,933
I was now fully committed
to a life I never could have imagined.

870
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:18,728
We rented a small space in a
warehouse and built a business.

871
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,398
We had about 20 customers
within a month.

872
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,608
But once word spread
about what we could do,

873
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:28,280
take a credit card payment online,
customers came pouring in.

874
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,699
But Buck and Wayne
never seemed to care.

875
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,784
Somehow they just didn't get it.

876
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:36,454
I'm just looking for a copy
of last month's invoice...

877
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,290
Jesus Christ.

878
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,083
Fucking idiots.

879
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:43,587
You got a check here for two million
dollars under a goddamn candy bar.

880
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,714
Oh, and what, that's a bad thing?

881
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,215
Yeah, like that's a bad thing?

882
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:50,385
Come on, guys,
this thing's been here for weeks.

883
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,555
Dude, chill out.

884
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:57,058
After a few months,
the warehouse owner asked us to move.

885
00:48:57,226 --> 00:49:02,397
I guess our clientele was distracting
his workers. But it didn't matter.

886
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:05,734
In no time at all, we had enough money
to buy our own building.

887
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:06,901
Yeah!

888
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,039
Go slow with that one.

889
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,083
I think I want that up
in the back left bedroom.

890
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,919
Every time I came home,
it was this wonderful homecoming.

891
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,422
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, sugar.

892
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:28,590
How you doing?

893
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:30,091
But I knew it couldn't last.

894
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:31,718
- Hey, buddy, how you doing?
- Dad!

895
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,762
I got you this.

896
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,348
I was throwing houses, gifts and cars

897
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,267
at a problem that could only
be solved by being home more.

898
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:40,602
I just couldn't do that.

899
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,437
- Is that for me?
- It is.

900
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,189
Diana would complain
every once in a while

901
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:46,775
that the new house
felt cold and empty without me,

902
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:50,195
but home was an increasingly
difficult concept for me.

903
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:53,782
It was like I was living two
lives that were worlds apart.

904
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,786
As we became more
and more successful,

905
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:02,165
everything became a bigger look for us.
Our parties, our lifestyle.

906
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,752
It wasn't even about being smart.
You just had to be fun,

907
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,796
and you'd draw more and more sites,

908
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,507
which meant more and more money,
which meant bigger planes,

909
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:14,302
bigger buildings, bigger cars,
bigger houses.

910
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,847
And of course, bigger egos.

911
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:43,873
Jack, Jack!

912
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,500
- Can I take a picture with you?
- Sure.

913
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,169
- Hey, I'm a big fan.
- Oh, just with Jack.

914
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,671
- What's that?
- Just with Jack.

915
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,464
- Oh, OK. OK.
- Thank you.

916
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,925
- Have a great evening.
- Jack, Jack, over here.

917
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,010
- Can we get an interview for the AVN?
- Sure, yeah.

918
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:58,179
- Sorry, guys, just Jack.
- What's that?

919
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,514
It'll just take a second.

920
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,683
- We're gonna go over here, all right?
- We'll see you in there.

921
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:04,018
So tell me, what makes
24/7 so special?

922
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,896
I think what makes 24/7 so special is,

923
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,898
we take the product,
which is on one side,

924
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,402
and we make it accessible to the
consumer, who's on the other side.

925
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,989
We make the entire operation
totally discreet and professional.

926
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:19,033
And, you know, we never forget
that it's a business.

927
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,537
We make a real point of making sure
that we take good care of both

928
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:25,707
the content provider
and the content subscriber.

929
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,125
That's pretty much
how we try and do business.

930
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,544
- Thank you, Jack.
- You got it. Have a good night.

931
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,630
You know, the more time you spend
around all this stuff,

932
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:36,676
the more normal it becomes.
It's a world without any filters.

933
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:41,055
It may be crass and in your face, but
there is something very honest about it.

934
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,058
The outside world
seems strange and mundane.

935
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,812
You know that most of the
outside world is looking down on you,

936
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,316
but you also know
at the exact same time,

937
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:53,610
if they were really honest
with themselves,

938
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,862
they'd kill to be
on the inside with you.

939
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,322
There's Audrey Dawns.

940
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,616
Hottest newbie starlet in the biz.

941
00:52:05,915 --> 00:52:09,375
After all these years,
everybody knew I was a family man.

942
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:13,713
But the second I saw her,
I knew that I was in trouble.

943
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:17,091
- Have you been on my site?
- I haven't, no.

944
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,261
Well, I'm not like your other sites.
I only do solo girl.

945
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,931
- Just me.
- What, do you got a guilty conscience?

946
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,809
Guilt? No. Hell, no.

947
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,312
I think people put too much
emphasis on guilt. You know?

948
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,439
Like, I bet if you ask
any one of those old-timers

949
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,399
in one of those old folks' homes,
they'll tell you

950
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,027
they regret the stuff they didn't do,
not the stuff they did.

951
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,363
- You only live once.
- Is that so?

952
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:40,782
- Yeah.
- You ever feel like this partnership

953
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,742
isn't such a real partnership?

954
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,996
You mean like he's Mick Jagger
and we're a bunch of roadies?

955
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,207
Yeah. We made that motherfucker.

956
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,084
I'd like to be in business with you.

957
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:55,255
- That I might regret.
- Why do you say that?

958
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,881
'Cause I've been ripped off before.

959
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,553
That wouldn't happen with me.

960
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,471
- No?
- No, it wouldn't.

961
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,140
Any chance you could
get me the money

962
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,142
that's been ripped off
from me so far?

963
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:15,441
Don't worry about it. We're rich.

964
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:18,736
Well... rich and somebody's bitch.

965
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,660
- Hey, Jack.
- Hi.

966
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:28,621
Things seem to be going very well.

967
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:33,501
Yeah. Yeah, things are good.
What are you doing here?

968
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:37,505
I have a large variety of clients.

969
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,343
Enlighten me here, Jack.

970
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,639
- Why did you cut me out?
- I didn't cut you out.

971
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:49,309
I gave you 200 grand up front,

972
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,687
before I even knew a deal
was in place. Didn't I?

973
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,690
- Yes. Yes, you did.
- OK.

974
00:53:56,859 --> 00:54:00,403
But... just look... look at you now.

975
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,781
Jerry, you're under indictment.

976
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,200
Please. Please, that'll never stick.

977
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,161
'Cause you see, I'm... I'm just...

978
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,330
I'm extremely smart.

979
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:14,208
Just answer me, why are you...

980
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,544
Why are you still hangin' around?

981
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:20,089
I mean, it certainly isn't the money.

982
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,883
Lord knows you have enough.

983
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:24,802
You're not a greedy man, Jack.

984
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,388
And for damn sure, it ain't the pussy.

985
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:30,141
You... you're sort of a throwback.

986
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:33,978
You're actually a faithful
and happily married man.

987
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,481
So why, why is it?

988
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:40,818
Jerry, why don't you just
enjoy the party, all right?

989
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:44,822
- You think too much.
- I love... I love to think.

990
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:48,826
And I... I love to hear my brain

991
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:52,038
go clickity, clickity, click.

992
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:55,583
Good to see you.

993
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,920
Sure thing, Jack.

994
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,719
- You don't want any?
- No.

995
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:21,818
Gentlemen. Gentlemen, hey,
get a hold of yourselves here.

996
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,112
I wanna introduce you
to the legendary Denny Z.

997
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,780
Hey, hey, hey.

998
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:29,158
Denny Z was a bottom feeder
and a complete scumbag.

999
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,953
The kind of person you'd be
embarrassed to spend time with.

1000
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:34,247
In this business, that's saying a lot.

1001
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:36,541
Yeah, I have some real interesting
ideas on the site's future, man.

1002
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:38,376
I want to set up a sick-ass portal

1003
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:39,752
- for premium members.
- Oh, yeah.

1004
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,964
You wanna let me finish?
Fucking cutting-edge shit, man.

1005
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:45,550
- I like what I'm hearing so far.
- Yeah, it sounds brilliant.

1006
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:48,136
- I haven't even said anything.
- Hey, hey. Let... Don't worry about it.

1007
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,638
Fuck the details.
I mean, the yak-yak-yak.

1008
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,557
Let's try to make a deal here,
all right?

1009
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:54,308
Denny Z, plus Haggerty,

1010
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,979
plus Buck and Wayne added up
badly any way you looked at it.

1011
00:55:58,147 --> 00:56:01,566
They started their own secret deal
to make money behind my back.

1012
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,735
But, in typical
Buck and Wayne fashion,

1013
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,487
they had no idea what
they'd gotten themselves into.

1014
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,073
- You got anymore vodka suppositories?
- Come on.

1015
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:22,587
I hired some good new people,
got the place turned around,

1016
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:26,966
then my friend couldn't come back to
take it back over, so now it's mine.

1017
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:30,094
That's why he's got me.
See, if anybody steals from him,

1018
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,721
I go and kick their ass.

1019
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,849
I can't have any thieves
or crooks around here

1020
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,560
because I'm too busy
stealing from Jack myself.

1021
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:42,648
Like that motherfucker right there.
Excuse me.

1022
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:51,991
Hey, dawg. What do you
think you're doing?

1023
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,367
What you think you're doing?

1024
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,536
- I'm doing myjob.
- I saw that shit.

1025
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,455
All right, so let me guess.

1026
00:56:57,623 --> 00:57:01,042
You... you start
to go home less and less.

1027
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,046
Your wife and kids
become total strangers,

1028
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:09,425
and now you find yourself
lonely and confused

1029
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:13,888
with a 23-year-old porn star.
Accurate?

1030
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:17,308
Well, I mean, I wouldn't exactly
call myself an absentee father.

1031
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:20,937
Sorry. I didn't mean to
strike a nerve or anything.

1032
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:24,398
- That's OK.
- It's the oldest story in the book.

1033
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,025
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1034
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,569
It's a carbon copy
of my life growing up.

1035
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,696
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1036
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,491
Absentee father working all the time.

1037
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:37,537
A self-obsessed mother,
50, trying to look 25.

1038
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,831
Eight Vicodins a day, drinks at noon.

1039
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,042
Her idea of a
well-rounded conversation

1040
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:47,839
usually consisted of questions like...
"Do I look puffy?"

1041
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:28,462
I just think you are so much
better than this world that you're in.

1042
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,173
What am I doing wrong, Diana?

1043
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,301
Come on. You don't know?
What am I supposed to tell people?

1044
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:36,304
I mean, how do you think I feel
that I can't tell anybody what you do?

1045
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,599
Why is it important to you that you
can tell people what I do for a living?

1046
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,977
Why is it not important to you?
That's what I wanna know.

1047
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,188
What about our children? How do
you think they're gonna handle it

1048
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,106
when they find out
what their daddy does?

1049
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:50,067
Well, if they've been raised right,
which I think they have,

1050
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,945
I just assume that they'll be OK,
which is all I care about.

1051
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,989
Well, you haven't really been
raising them, have you?

1052
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,700
Come on, you're never home, Jack.

1053
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:00,286
How would you know if
they're being raised right?

1054
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,997
Guess who that falls on?

1055
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,769
I'm sorry about today in the car.

1056
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:26,145
It's OK.

1057
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,483
Hey.

1058
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,991
I missed you so much.

1059
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,374
Jack.

1060
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,711
You feel good.

1061
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:05,935
Hey.

1062
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,064
Where you going?

1063
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,066
Come back here.

1064
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:24,203
Where are you?

1065
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,249
I don't know.

1066
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:32,044
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

1067
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:35,006
What do you mean you're sorry?

1068
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:37,883
Oh, my God.

1069
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,846
Let me out.

1070
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:45,266
Let me out. Let me out!

1071
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:47,393
Oh, my God.

1072
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:57,361
So I guess we're talking
about a divorce then, aren't we?

1073
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:01,198
What do you think?
We just go on like this?

1074
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,618
Oh, God, I despise this hypocrisy.

1075
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,871
I'm still in love with you, Diana.

1076
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,331
Bullshit.

1077
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,958
So now I'm flying back to LA,

1078
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:14,337
feeling like it's pretty much
over between me and Diana.

1079
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,048
She was right.
I wasn't there anymore.

1080
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,760
I'd become addicted to a lifestyle
of money, sex and power

1081
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:25,431
that was light years away from family
or anything I'd ever experienced.

1082
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,808
You see, the biggest problem
with my addiction,

1083
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:31,729
was that like all addictions,
it sneaks up on you slowly.

1084
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:36,650
You give into it incrementally,
in an almost imperceptible way.

1085
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,153
The other thing was it wasn't
the kind of addiction

1086
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,988
where you'd wake up with a hangover.

1087
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:43,616
It wasn't the kind of thing
that would rob you of your wealth.

1088
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,785
It didn't rob you of your health.

1089
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:49,705
The more I indulged,
the richer it would make me.

1090
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:53,667
I've got to tell you...
that's impossible to give up.

1091
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,475
I can hear your thoughts.

1092
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,146
I believe you.
You don't have to tell me.

1093
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:22,029
You like post-orgasm silence?

1094
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,200
Don't we all?

1095
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:29,495
You don't have to be mean
just because you feel so guilty.

1096
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,123
Do you need me to
let you off the hook?

1097
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:40,339
Despite what you think, you actually
don't have that kind of power over me.

1098
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:43,092
Don't kid yourself.

1099
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,094
I'm not.

1100
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,221
- I'm younger.
- Yeah.

1101
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,557
- I'm hotter.
- OK.

1102
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:54,103
And you like my pussy way more
'cause it's tighter and prettier.

1103
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,776
That's so poetic.

1104
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,800
You really know
all about this stuff?

1105
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,260
Yes.

1106
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:30,222
All right, so this shows
the horse's past performance.

1107
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,390
OK.

1108
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:34,101
And this indicates how much
the horse has run.

1109
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:36,103
See? This horse ran three times
in the last three weeks,

1110
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,229
so it's probably tired.

1111
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,190
- Yeah?
- We don't wanna bet on that one. 'Kay?

1112
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,150
- All right.
- And this horse here,

1113
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,776
it runs well on a sloppy track.

1114
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,904
So just 'cause a horse won
its last few races,

1115
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,239
doesn't mean it's gonna win
against a different class of horse.

1116
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:49,283
- You're really good at this.
- Thank you.

1117
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:50,784
You're welcome.

1118
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:55,289
- I'm sorry, I didn't order that.
- Courtesy of Mr. Sokoloff, sir.

1119
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,416
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1120
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:06,967
I'll be right back.

1121
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,434
- Hey.
- You didn't have to do that.

1122
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:18,771
- Hey, come, come.
- Thank you.

1123
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:21,065
Did you know that
the FBI is following you?

1124
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:23,317
- What?
- Don't look now.

1125
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:26,654
Don't move. Don't react.

1126
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:30,533
I'm just telling you that those men,

1127
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,995
sitting at a table,
you can see them over my head,

1128
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,623
they are with the FBI.

1129
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,960
Organized Crime task force.

1130
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:46,090
I know them because they practically
put me to bed every night.

1131
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:49,009
What makes you so sure
they're following me?

1132
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,220
And what makes you
so sure they're not?

1133
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:54,014
They're also terrible actors.

1134
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:57,935
They stick out like sore thumb,
don't you think?

1135
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:00,437
That doesn't mean
they're following me.

1136
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:06,318
Do you see that guy standing
above them? See him?

1137
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,529
The one on the cell phone?

1138
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:09,989
That's my cousin Yuri.

1139
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,533
They follow me, he follows them.

1140
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:15,160
He just called me a few seconds ago

1141
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:19,206
and he said, they were talking
about you. Not about me.

1142
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,584
Isn't that refreshing?

1143
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:26,338
Maybe they tuck you in tonight?

1144
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:29,883
They have no reason to follow me.
I'm just a businessman.

1145
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,261
Aren't we all?

1146
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:40,269
- Hi, baby.
- You know her?

1147
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:44,398
Yes. I know her.
She danced at my clubs.

1148
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:48,319
Nice girl. Very nice girl.

1149
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,743
How do you know Niki?

1150
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:59,371
We did some business
together a few years ago.

1151
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,415
Yeah? Me, too.

1152
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,792
Yeah, he said you danced
at one of his clubs.

1153
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,006
Yep. His scumbag lawyer is the one
responsible for me losing all that money

1154
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:10,591
- on my site.
- What do you mean?

1155
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:12,801
Nikita set me up with
his lawyer to do my contracts

1156
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,721
when I first started my site.
He really fucked me over.

1157
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,931
- I don't understand.
- Jerry Haggerty.

1158
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,392
- Yeah?
- Fucking scumbag.

1159
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,770
Jerry Haggerty is Nikita's lawyer?

1160
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,022
- Nikita something.
- Sokoloff?

1161
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:26,440
I think that sounds about right.

1162
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:29,276
Yep. Why, do you know him?

1163
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,449
Let's go. Gotta get out of here.

1164
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,293
- Where's Jerry?
- Hey, Jack.

1165
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:48,587
What a surprise.

1166
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,464
You're Sokoloff's lawyer?

1167
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:52,633
- Sorry?
- You heard me, Jerry.

1168
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:55,844
Now, Jack you know I can't
disclose who my clients are.

1169
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,306
- That's attorney-client privilege.
- Why are you fuckin' with me, Jerry?

1170
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:02,476
OK, then, yeah.
Yeah. Don't be moronic.

1171
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:05,145
Of course I'm his lawyer.
I mean, how do you think I found out

1172
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:07,356
about this situation in the first place?

1173
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:08,649
You ripped me off.

1174
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:11,235
In God's name,
what are you talking about?

1175
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:14,446
The big fucking Russian Ivan.
That was you, I know that was you.

1176
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:17,324
He shows up at my house
demanding double what I owed him.

1177
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,993
- Some of that was meant for you.
- Yeah, so? So? So what?

1178
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:23,997
So, I'm trying to take a little skim,
for Christ's sakes?

1179
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:27,251
I mean, and you're making what?
Close to 1 00 million?

1180
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:29,628
And what, you throw me
a tuna fish sandwich?

1181
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,632
That ain't right. That ain't right.

1182
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,260
And then, so... so tell me,
what... what do I get?

1183
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:38,679
"Thanks for putting
this all together, Jerry."

1184
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:42,266
That ain't right,
and you know it, motherfucker.

1185
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:45,352
I took care of you, OK?
I've paid my debt to you.

1186
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,854
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

1187
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:51,525
Yeah, well, see, the problem is
I don't really see it like that, Jack.

1188
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:54,194
Listen, I'm serious.
All right? We're finished.

1189
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:57,489
No. No, you see, we're not finished.

1190
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:58,741
Yeah, we are, Jerry.

1191
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:02,327
We can't be.
Listen, you killed Ivan, right?

1192
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:08,667
- What did you just say to me?
- Well, I mean you had to kill him.

1193
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:13,672
The man's gone. I mean,
he was here, and then he's gone.

1194
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,717
I mean, vanished.
Disappeared. Like in thin air.

1195
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:19,636
It seems pretty obvious
that he took the money and left.

1196
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:23,599
Yes. Yes, see I...
I thought that too for a while.

1197
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:29,730
But I don't think this guy would
have just run off with $450,000.

1198
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:33,817
I mean, he might try to start a new life
with four or five million, you know,

1199
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:35,903
but not that kind of chump change.

1200
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:39,281
So, you see, it just doesn't
make any sense to me, Jack.

1201
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:42,576
So you had to have
something to do with it.

1202
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:46,747
Jerry, if you even suspected that
was the truth, you'd be bleeding me dry.

1203
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:51,752
Sure. But I might be looking
to catch a bigger fish.

1204
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,756
Listen, if you even think about
repeating this conversation to anybody,

1205
01:08:55,924 --> 01:08:59,760
even in jest, I swear to God,
I'll throw you off a fucking roof.

1206
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,597
I didn't kill anybody.

1207
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:04,890
Sure thing, Jack.

1208
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,934
You oughta calm down a little.

1209
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,478
I mean, we're just a couple
of guys talking here.

1210
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,486
I just wanted to carve
out a moment of peace,

1211
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,614
to close my eyes
and dream up a solution.

1212
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,616
Something really romantic,

1213
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,827
like Haggerty getting hit by a bus,

1214
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:28,580
or Wayne and Buck
spontaneously combusting.

1215
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:31,458
What I heard next, I could not believe.

1216
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:33,544
- Guess what?
- What?

1217
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,379
The FBI was just here.

1218
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,715
Why?

1219
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:41,802
Do you know anything
about terrorism, Audrey?

1220
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:48,600
What kind of terrorism
are you referring to?

1221
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,645
Do you mean like
national, international,

1222
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:55,691
eco, bio or just your
everyday suicide bomber?

1223
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,445
Middle Eastern terrorists, Audrey.

1224
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,243
Audrey, we've come to you today
with an opportunity

1225
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:10,330
that very few Americans
have ever had in history.

1226
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,377
It turns out you have several
high-ranking members

1227
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:20,591
of a terrorist organization
who are huge fans of your website.

1228
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,013
Really?

1229
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,016
Apparently, some terrorist in Hamburg

1230
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:31,810
that Interpol was on the hunt for
was obsessed with Audrey.

1231
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,563
It turned out they could
literally track his whereabouts

1232
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,816
when he logged onto the site. Now,
he likes Audrey's website so much,

1233
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:41,028
he emails another
terrorist in Afghanistan...

1234
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,363
...who emails another in Pakistan.

1235
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:46,366
Pretty soon, you've got
a worldwide terrorist circle jerk,

1236
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:48,160
all because of Audrey's site.

1237
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:52,039
The Navy was scrambling fighters
off the decks of aircraft carriers...

1238
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:55,334
...whenever Audrey Dawns
was doing her thing.

1239
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:12,267
They didn't think
we'd be willing to help them.

1240
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:15,354
I think they were trying to figure out
a way to force you into it,

1241
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:18,315
but they didn't have
anything compromising on you.

1242
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:20,567
- This is crazy, isn't it?
- I know.

1243
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,986
I mean, we're gonna be like...

1244
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:26,531
We're gonna be like spies,
working for the government.

1245
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,075
It turns me on!

1246
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:29,409
It was all so crazy.

1247
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:33,038
A 23-year-old porn star was
about to become a major component

1248
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,165
in America's war on terror.

1249
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,584
Now, at the same time,

1250
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:40,921
Buck and Wayne finally put
together what Denny Z was up to

1251
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:42,589
with their new secret website.

1252
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:45,634
What do you mean? What do you
mean "under 1 8"? How do you know?

1253
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,678
I'm telling you,
I saw it with my own eyes.

1254
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:51,056
These girls are underage.
You need to confront this, Wayne.

1255
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:53,266
I saw fuckin' pigtails,
I saw little fucking girls.

1256
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:56,186
Shit, this is not good, man.
I can't believe he fucked us like that.

1257
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,563
He totally fucked us!
25 years to life! He fucked us!

1258
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,399
Oh, no. I'm not going to prison. Oh, no.

1259
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,150
We gotta get the fuck
out of the country, right now.

1260
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,610
Call a chopper, land on the roof,

1261
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:06,446
chopper out to Van Nuys Airport
and take the jet down to Cambodia.

1262
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,949
- You're getting way ahead of yourself.
- We gotta get the fuck out.

1263
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:11,243
We need to demand Denny Z
fucking disable this site!

1264
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:13,036
And we need to fucking say nothing.

1265
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:15,747
- I'm not going to prison.
- We're not fucking pedophiles, man.

1266
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:19,126
- Yeah, tell that to the judge.
- Judge, we're not fucking pedophiles.

1267
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:21,294
OK.

1268
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,466
- Hey, guys, the FBI is here.
- What?

1269
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,885
Yeah, they're up there talking to Jack.

1270
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:33,932
- Terrorists?
- Correct.

1271
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,642
- And Audrey?
- Right.

1272
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:39,021
We've been able to confirm that

1273
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,773
these terrorists have very
specific viewing patterns.

1274
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:43,817
They're men.

1275
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:45,944
For example...

1276
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:51,241
...we have found that
they very much enjoy

1277
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:56,997
solo or girl-on-girl,
much more than the hardcore.

1278
01:12:57,165 --> 01:13:01,835
I mean, they'll watch it,
but they're incredibly homophobic.

1279
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,463
Another example.

1280
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:09,009
They enjoy sites that have,
and this is a surprise to no one,

1281
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:12,054
- a military theme.
- Military themes?

1282
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,765
Girls posing with guns and the like.

1283
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:18,310
What your government
is recommending...

1284
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:25,067
We recommend Audrey create
a new section on her site

1285
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:29,196
- with a separate payment method.
- A portal.

1286
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:32,324
This will allow us to hone our efforts.

1287
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,534
- What are they fucking doing?
- They're just talking.

1288
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:37,204
I'm freaking the fuck out.
I'm not going to prison.

1289
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,207
Oh, fuck!

1290
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:42,501
...on their specific viewing,

1291
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:46,713
much more so using
said portal through you.

1292
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,093
And we believe this to be
the key to our success.

1293
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:55,055
Oh, of course. Anything I can
do to help, I'll be glad to.

1294
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:58,475
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God,
he's shaking their hands. Oh, fuck.

1295
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:01,019
I'm fucking telling you,
he fucking called 'em!

1296
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:04,898
So now these idiots think I'm
conspiring with the Feds against them.

1297
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,609
Of course, I had no idea
what was going on.

1298
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,736
They go into a full-blown panic,

1299
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:12,656
and of all the people
in the world to confide in,

1300
01:14:12,824 --> 01:14:13,740
who do they go see?

1301
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:26,169
Listen. I gotta tell you,
you guys really piss me off.

1302
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:30,006
I'm pissed off because every time
you have a problem, you come to me.

1303
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:32,551
It's never, "Hey, Jerry,
you wanna go have some dinner,"

1304
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:35,720
or, "We're doing well,
now here's a little gift for you

1305
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,514
because without you,
we would have nothing."

1306
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:40,016
No, but if you got Russians
that are looking to kill you

1307
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,269
or you're worried about the FBI

1308
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,312
because you got a 16-year-old
on your website...

1309
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,939
OK, OK.

1310
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,150
...I immediately become
your best friend. Right?

1311
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,735
- It's not like that. That's not true.
- Well, bullshit.

1312
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:54,322
- So, how bad is it?
- Minors fucking on your website?

1313
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,283
It's not very good, to be honest.

1314
01:14:56,450 --> 01:15:00,203
It's not like it's kiddie porn.
The girls are 16 or 1 7...

1315
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:01,454
You know, we gotta keep it down.

1316
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:04,457
- The girls are 16 or 1 7 years old.
- I see.

1317
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,961
But I'm not sure that the government
shares your sense of nuance there.

1318
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:10,213
- What do we do?
- We? You got a turd in your pocket?

1319
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,465
First thing you two
rocket scientists gotta do

1320
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:14,634
is get rid of that creepy Denny Z.

1321
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:16,469
You gotta get as far away
from that as possible.

1322
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:17,929
- What?
- Buck called him already.

1323
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,347
- Denny Z?
- Yeah.

1324
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,099
You're the guy that
put us in touch with him,

1325
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:22,475
told us to get into business with him.

1326
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:25,478
I wanna introduce you
to the legendary Denny Z.

1327
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,981
- That I don't recall.
- That's fucked up.

1328
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:29,774
You don't remember that?

1329
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,405
Respectfully, it's fucked up.

1330
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,282
But it's rather irrelevant now,
isn't it?

1331
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,784
I think it's relevant.
I mean, you did introduce us to him.

1332
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,622
Nobody likes a finger pointed at them.

1333
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,334
Nobody. And I demand the same respect
that I show you two jerk-offs.

1334
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,044
Jerry, how do we make this disappear?

1335
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:51,463
That's another "we."
Let me ask you a question,

1336
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:53,006
what are you guys worth now?

1337
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,508
Well, it's kind of
hard to keep track of.

1338
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:59,429
Well, give me a rough. Like an estimate.
Maybe, what, 1 00 million?

1339
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:02,015
- Maybe something in that area?
- It's more like 50.

1340
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:04,184
- A hundred, 200 million.
- It's more like 50.

1341
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:06,186
- About a hundred million.
- And, you know, God forbid,

1342
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:08,647
you never thought of giving me
a little piece of that?

1343
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,690
In the beginning, Jack said
you were under indictment.

1344
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:14,861
Hey, fuck Jack.
And that little plan of yours

1345
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:16,655
apparently didn't go so well.

1346
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,865
You've got FBI looking up
your ass right now.

1347
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:20,867
How about...
how about the three of us?

1348
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:23,495
- We work together, make a partnership.
- Yeah, yeah.

1349
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:24,788
- Now, what about Jack?
- Fuck Jack.

1350
01:16:24,956 --> 01:16:27,207
- I said that.
- We'll deal with him.

1351
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:29,042
All right.
The first thing you gotta do

1352
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,503
is get rid of that goddamn website.

1353
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:34,214
Then maybe I can help
straighten things out for you.

1354
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:37,300
Thank you very much. Thank you for
everything. You've been a real friend.

1355
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:38,885
- Sure.
- I'm sorry.

1356
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:41,388
- I actually gotta take a shit.
- Sit the fuck down.

1357
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,431
Oh, forget about it.

1358
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,559
So Buck and Wayne told Haggerty
they'd shut the site down.

1359
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:49,062
What happened next you won't believe.

1360
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,981
They just simply forgot.

1361
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:56,403
Listen, I would like to say something
and it's from the bottom of my heart.

1362
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:02,242
I would be extremely unhappy if,
let's say, I got blindsided

1363
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:04,244
and I wound up in court with you two.

1364
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:07,539
So I wanna ask, are you sure,

1365
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:11,418
absolutely sure, that you've told me
everything that there is to know?

1366
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:20,093
- There's an unnecessary pause here.
- No, no, no no, no, no. Jerry.

1367
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:23,638
Jerry, we will never
do that to you again. OK?

1368
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,268
Do not ever fuck with me.

1369
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:29,853
- Jerry, Jerry...
- Fuck!

1370
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:31,604
Do you understand?

1371
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:34,607
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1372
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,234
And before you know it,

1373
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:39,237
Buck and Wayne told Haggerty
about the dead Russian.

1374
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:43,825
Every last detail about how
james accidentally killed Ivan.

1375
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,160
They didn't get their money!

1376
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:48,830
Now, Haggerty's got me
in the worst possible position.

1377
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:03,053
- Yeah?
- Your son's been arrested.

1378
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:09,142
- What?
- Your son has been arrested, Jack.

1379
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,643
What happened? What did he do?

1380
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,604
Maybe if you were around
a little bit, you'd know.

1381
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:17,067
Our oldest son, Michael, decided he
didn't care for his grades that semester

1382
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:20,779
so he hacked into the school's computer
system and changed them to his liking.

1383
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:23,073
Now, even though
our marriage was over,

1384
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,201
Diana and I always came together
for our children.

1385
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:30,330
Even if we couldn't be a couple,
we were always gonna be a family.

1386
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:33,833
So, we went to visit the
headmaster at the school.

1387
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:36,086
And after some serious discussion,

1388
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:39,506
and a generous donation
to the new gymnasium,

1389
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:41,508
he decided to drop the charges.

1390
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:42,801
What did you have in mind?

1391
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:44,636
But that wasn't enough.

1392
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:46,805
The Houston District Attorney,
Frank Griffin,

1393
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:50,517
decided to proceed with the charges
anyway. So I paid him a visit.

1394
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:53,978
Hi. Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir.

1395
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:57,607
Do you have an appointment?
Sir. Excuse me, sir.

1396
01:18:57,775 --> 01:19:01,403
- Jack Harris.
- Sorry, Mr. Griffin. He walked past.

1397
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:02,862
That's OK, gingersnap.

1398
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:04,697
- May I?
- Please.

1399
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:06,241
Thanks.

1400
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:11,121
So... my lawyers
tell me we need to talk.

1401
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:13,790
I know who you are and I'm not gonna
change my position, Mr. Harris.

1402
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:17,043
Your son's committed a very serious
crime, and although he may be a minor,

1403
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:20,046
the state of Texas intends to prosecute
him to the full extent of the law.

1404
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:23,133
Mr. Griffin, he's just a kid.

1405
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,886
He made a stupid mistake
and I've reprimanded him, severely.

1406
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:30,557
With all due respect, sir, the school
doesn't even wanna press charges.

1407
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:32,559
Do we really need to go
forward with all this?

1408
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:35,145
Harris, let me lay it all out for you.

1409
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:38,815
There are people, voters,

1410
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:41,818
upstanding people,
to whom I am responsible.

1411
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:43,069
I have to answer to them.

1412
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,238
And they want to see him
tried for this?

1413
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:48,908
Well, maybe the acorn doesn't
fall too far from the tree.

1414
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:52,412
So that's what this is all about?
This is more about me than my son?

1415
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:55,248
We all know what you do for a living.
You deal in pornography.

1416
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:58,334
- I run a billing company.
- But you deal with pornography.

1417
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:01,421
Like any hotel chain,
like any satellite or cable company.

1418
01:20:01,589 --> 01:20:03,882
- I'm just a middle man.
- I'm not gonna play semantics.

1419
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:07,093
You're a pornographer. You peddle
pornography over the Internet.

1420
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:10,638
I think we're getting off the subject.
Let's focus on why we're here.

1421
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:15,894
What's this?

1422
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,813
Here, I'll give you a hand with it.
Let's see, OK.

1423
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:22,734
Yeah. YoungTightPussy.com.

1424
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:25,445
SplendorInTheAss.com.

1425
01:20:25,613 --> 01:20:30,283
BlacksOnBlondes.com. This is
your billing record, Mr. Griffin.

1426
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:32,035
Take a look at it.

1427
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:41,127
Now, God forbid this
should wind up in here

1428
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:43,087
and fall into the wrong hands.

1429
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:44,631
It'd be on the cover
of tomorrow's paper.

1430
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:47,383
Can you imagine what that would
do to a campaign in this city?

1431
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:50,136
Especially the campaign
of a man whose voter base

1432
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:53,306
is a bunch of good, God-fearing
Christian conservatives?

1433
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:56,100
I mean... that'd be terrible.

1434
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:04,484
You realize you just attempted
to blackmail an officer of the court

1435
01:21:04,652 --> 01:21:06,819
and a publicly elected
Texas state official?

1436
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:10,323
And it worked.

1437
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,575
I'm assuming you can
clear up this mess.

1438
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:15,161
I'll be glad to handle this
bump in the road for your son.

1439
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:16,955
- Great.
- Can I count on your vote next year?

1440
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,081
You got it.

1441
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:21,000
The power of the
Internet is truly amazing.

1442
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,885
Well, come hell or high water,
you get it done, don't you?

1443
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:32,387
I try.

1444
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:35,640
There's a part of me that hates
what you did to that man.

1445
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,229
There's also a part of me that just...

1446
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,357
I miss being protected
by you like that.

1447
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:47,819
Oh, God, I'm confused.

1448
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:51,322
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
- Just get out, Jack.

1449
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:54,200
I'll call you when I get there.

1450
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:12,594
When I was looking for dirt on the DA,
I came across this site here.

1451
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,178
- It's a Denny Z site.
- Yep.

1452
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,514
- You're not gonna like this.
- What?

1453
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,100
It's under Buck and Wayne's domain.

1454
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,813
- Shit.
- It gets worse.

1455
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,072
With glass dildos?
We can make that happen.

1456
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,783
- And I'll personally hire Santa.
- We have developed a new...

1457
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,077
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?!
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1458
01:22:38,245 --> 01:22:39,537
Underage girls!

1459
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,707
- Where is he?!
- We didn't know. I didn't know.

1460
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,584
- Jack!
- He's at the Reseda house,

1461
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:45,752
where they shoot everything.

1462
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:48,004
Come on, we were gonna tell you.
We were in way over our heads!

1463
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:49,797
Jack, Z fucked us!

1464
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,424
Denny Z fucked all of us!

1465
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:41,641
What the fuck are you doing, man?

1466
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:46,562
Fucking son of a bitch!

1467
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:50,149
I'll have you fucking killed, you prick!

1468
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:52,151
Get the fuck out of my house!

1469
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:55,988
What the fuck are you gonna do?

1470
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:57,782
What the fuck?

1471
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,701
Fuck!

1472
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:05,665
Son of a bitch! Call 91 1 !

1473
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:07,333
Cocksucker!

1474
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:02,805
Hey.

1475
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:06,893
What's up with you?

1476
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:14,567
You know, I used to sit
at the table with my family.

1477
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,069
Is this the old-fashioned Jack?

1478
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:20,573
Old-fashioned?
Families are old-fashioned?

1479
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,867
I think families are overrated.

1480
01:25:25,204 --> 01:25:29,624
You ever get the feeling that there's
a part of ourselves we just turn off?

1481
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:34,170
- Which part is that?
- I feel like it's the part that...

1482
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:38,883
...tells us this kind of
behavior is wrong.

1483
01:25:40,594 --> 01:25:42,762
Some of the things that we're doing...

1484
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:45,389
You're gonna start moralizing?

1485
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:48,142
No.

1486
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,228
Jack, you have made all this money

1487
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:51,979
because of all the horny,
frustrated guys out there

1488
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:54,148
who have to jerk off because
their wives or their girlfriends

1489
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:57,777
don't treat them right. So...
so I become their little fantasy girl

1490
01:25:57,945 --> 01:26:01,781
for five bucks a pop and make 'em
forget for a fleeting fuckin' instant

1491
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:04,492
that their wives and kids can't
stand the fuckin' sight of them.

1492
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:07,745
So, no, I don't have guilt for that.

1493
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:08,871
You're lucky.

1494
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:12,792
And my soul is perfectly fucking intact.

1495
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,920
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1496
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,591
You know what I'm starting to think?

1497
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:22,760
I'm starting to think
you're full of shit.

1498
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:24,804
You are so fucking full of shit.

1499
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:27,473
I don't fuckin' need to be here.

1500
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:30,101
Why? Tell me why,
why do I have to be here?

1501
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:33,646
So you can get a call in the middle of
the night from your fucking bitchy wife,

1502
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:36,315
your fucking Texas bitchy fucking wife,

1503
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:38,526
saying that one of your
spoiled fucking kids

1504
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:41,153
can't make it to the prep school
fucking homecoming?

1505
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:44,574
Your bags are packed, Audrey.

1506
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,999
Why?

1507
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:56,335
We don't belong anywhere
near each other, that's why.

1508
01:26:56,503 --> 01:27:01,841
I'm sorry, I... I didn't mean
what I said about your family.

1509
01:27:02,009 --> 01:27:06,178
I'm sorry, Jack. Just, please
don't do this to me. Please.

1510
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:10,266
Please, please.
Please don't do this to me.

1511
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:14,562
I'll do what you want.
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

1512
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,772
I'll be whatever you
want me to be, Jack. Please.

1513
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,691
Can't.

1514
01:27:24,031 --> 01:27:26,115
Fine. Fine.

1515
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:28,659
Fucking fine!

1516
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:57,647
- Yeah?
- jack, it's Allmans.

1517
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:59,857
- I gotta see you.
- Can it wait?

1518
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:01,776
It can't wait an hour.

1519
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:10,242
Thanks for coming, Jack.

1520
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:13,037
You wanna lift up your arms for me
if you wouldn't mind, please?

1521
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:15,081
Why?

1522
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:17,249
I just gotta make sure
you're not wearin' a wire.

1523
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,126
Why the hell would I wear a wire?

1524
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:22,254
Have a seat, Jack.
I'm here to help you.

1525
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:26,592
I just can't risk getting
compromised in that process.

1526
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,428
Forgive me for takin' the
battery out of your phone here.

1527
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:34,016
You're a stand-up guy, Jack.
Your country owes you.

1528
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:39,105
Case in point, two nights ago,

1529
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:41,857
several top-ranking terrorists

1530
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:44,610
were taken out in a fire fight
in Afghanistan.

1531
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:47,446
Several arrests
were made in Europe, Indonesia.

1532
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:50,950
All told about 1 00 rounded up.
And in no small part, thanks to you.

1533
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:55,287
So when I found out about this other
thing, the least I could do is warn you.

1534
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:56,664
Warn me about what?

1535
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,416
One of our
investigators has confirmed

1536
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,627
the use of underage girls
on one of your websites.

1537
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:07,591
- Jesus.
- Yeah, it's bad, Jack.

1538
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:09,427
Any way you cut it,
it's child pornography,

1539
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,470
which means you're indicted
and you go to jail.

1540
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:15,099
I got nothing to do with
that website, you know that?

1541
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:17,601
I do know that.

1542
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,103
But you got partners.

1543
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:27,445
OK.

1544
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:31,323
What am I supposed
to do about this warning?

1545
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:33,492
Get out, now, yesterday if possible.

1546
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,078
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

1547
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:45,004
If by "I can't," you're referring
to this mess, let's talk about it.

1548
01:29:45,172 --> 01:29:46,464
How you boys doing tonight?

1549
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,841
One of your ex-bouncers
was busted for drugs

1550
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:52,303
a couple of months ago and told us
a story about Ivan Sokoloff,

1551
01:29:52,471 --> 01:29:54,764
nephew of Nikita Sokoloff,

1552
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:58,225
being murdered in your
living room five years ago.

1553
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:01,270
Said bouncer also witnessed you
dumping the body in the ocean

1554
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:03,022
off the coast of Catalina.

1555
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:06,067
It's myjob to know when
people are lying to me, Jack.

1556
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,359
He wasn't.

1557
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:12,281
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1558
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:15,201
I guess that's what I'd say.

1559
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:18,704
But I'm here to help you, so let me
tell you what I think happened.

1560
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:20,456
You're out here, you got strong-armed.

1561
01:30:20,624 --> 01:30:22,374
I don't know, maybe you're
doing somebody a favor,

1562
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,211
but you got here and realized you
could make a quick buck and get out.

1563
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:28,547
But then you got partnered
with these idiots,

1564
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:31,217
who now you can't trust because
they're hanging this Sokoloff thing

1565
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:35,805
over your head. Listen, I don't
give a shit that Ivan is dead.

1566
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:37,389
We, your government,

1567
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:40,851
celebrates when a piece of shit
like this no longer breathes.

1568
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:44,230
But this child pornography thing...

1569
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:47,149
...that doesn't go away, Jack.
That's you in prison.

1570
01:30:52,572 --> 01:30:56,283
So, I mean, what am I supposed to do?
I mean, I can't go back in time.

1571
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,204
You did your government a solid.

1572
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:04,834
That's why you're getting the warning.
The rest is up to you to figure out.

1573
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:34,697
- Honey!
- Diana, what's going on?

1574
01:31:34,865 --> 01:31:36,740
- They took him!
- What?

1575
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,159
They took him!

1576
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:43,706
Boys! Come on.

1577
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:55,885
You call police, we kill your boy.

1578
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:58,387
Better call your husband instead.

1579
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:15,321
- Yeah?
- jack. I have your son.

1580
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,656
Don't fuck around with me.

1581
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:20,659
I will call you tonight
with what I want.

1582
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:25,080
I got it. All right? I'm on my way.
Just don't do anything, all right?

1583
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,832
Good.

1584
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:40,012
- What the hell is this?
- This is the boy.

1585
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:41,680
- What?
- This is boy from house.

1586
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:43,849
- What the hell are you talking about?
- That's not Jack's kid.

1587
01:32:44,017 --> 01:32:46,518
That child is Mexican.
That's Alejandro, the maid's kid.

1588
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:48,520
What is Mexican?
This is boy from house.

1589
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:50,606
That's Alejandro! That's Alejandro!

1590
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:52,191
- Wait.
- That's Alejandro!

1591
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:53,692
- Wait.
- Hi, Alejandro.

1592
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:56,695
You say it's not Jack's boy?

1593
01:32:56,863 --> 01:32:59,448
Nikita, do you not understand
the English that we're speaking?

1594
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:01,659
This is the housekeeper's son.

1595
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:05,412
His mother is the housekeeper.
This is a Mexican person.

1596
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,623
We are Caucasian people, OK?

1597
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:09,541
You think Jack's gonna
give a shit about this?

1598
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:11,043
You know, he's gonna call the cops!

1599
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:14,546
Hey, is it a bag of hammers or a bag
of hair that you have for brains?

1600
01:33:16,466 --> 01:33:18,050
It's a Mexican!

1601
01:33:19,678 --> 01:33:21,470
It's a Mexican boy.

1602
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:25,349
- Shut up!
- We gotta get the fuck outta here.

1603
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:27,184
- Did you send them...
- No, I got a bad feeling.

1604
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:32,690
Sit the fuck down.

1605
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,316
You are not going anywhere.

1606
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:36,277
Where'd you find these people anyway?

1607
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:40,239
OK, OK, OK! OK, OK!

1608
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:43,075
I've done this before.

1609
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:47,037
I know this man. He will pay.

1610
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:50,124
- OK, OK.
- And if you fuck up...

1611
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:53,127
...I swear I'll kill you.

1612
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:32,291
You OK, Dad?

1613
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:39,173
Yeah.

1614
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:42,926
Come here.

1615
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,027
I need you to do something for me, OK?

1616
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:05,991
Sure.

1617
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:11,038
Keep an eye on Mom, all right?

1618
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:14,792
Got it? She loves you a lot.

1619
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:19,671
Yes, sir.

1620
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:23,092
OK.

1621
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:26,804
OK?

1622
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,974
Good boy.

1623
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:37,940
I'm gonna get him back, Diana.

1624
01:36:55,477 --> 01:36:57,144
Why am I not surprised?

1625
01:36:58,188 --> 01:37:00,272
Because, Jack, you're a very smart man.

1626
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,025
You've also always been
a very lucky man,

1627
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:06,445
but, alas, your luck seems
to have run out on you.

1628
01:37:06,613 --> 01:37:08,697
I assume that's the money?

1629
01:37:08,865 --> 01:37:10,491
Let's focus on why we're here.

1630
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:12,910
You're not gonna get shit from me
until I know the kid is safe.

1631
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:15,412
Jack, we're not animals here. Of course.

1632
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:16,830
And this'll make you happy.

1633
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:19,458
That money's not going to me,
it's going to him.

1634
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:25,964
Hey, buddy.

1635
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:32,221
You all right? You sure? OK.

1636
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:35,641
Let's go, all right?

1637
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:41,230
Can he go now?

1638
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:45,108
- Yeah, sure.
- Alejandro, just take a left.

1639
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:47,152
Go down the hall.

1640
01:37:50,156 --> 01:37:51,782
Thank you for not hurting him.

1641
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:59,206
- Why did you kill Ivan?
- I didn't kill anybody.

1642
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:02,000
All right?
I promise, it was an accident.

1643
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:03,335
You can ask them. They were there.

1644
01:38:03,503 --> 01:38:05,003
No, no, no.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1645
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:06,922
We had nothing
to do with that, Nikita.

1646
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:09,424
- It was James, his bodyguard...
- He threatened my family.

1647
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:11,426
It wasn't supposed
to go down that way, Nikita.

1648
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:14,429
I know he was your nephew,
and this might not mean much,

1649
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:17,933
but, look, I'm very sorry...

1650
01:38:18,101 --> 01:38:21,270
Easy there, we don't want him
signing contracts under duress.

1651
01:38:22,522 --> 01:38:25,190
Jack, there's really no need
for long conversation here.

1652
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:28,694
I mean, you got the kid back, so why
don't you just sign these papers

1653
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:30,571
and we're through.

1654
01:38:32,115 --> 01:38:33,615
What am I supposed to sign?

1655
01:38:33,783 --> 01:38:35,617
Every line that's
got your name next to it.

1656
01:38:35,785 --> 01:38:39,538
See, that'll certify that the
business now belongs to Nikita,

1657
01:38:39,706 --> 01:38:41,290
myself and the boys.

1658
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:44,960
So with pen in hand,
would you like to write?

1659
01:38:46,879 --> 01:38:48,547
Nice.

1660
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:09,568
Get out... now.

1661
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:14,323
What am I supposed to do?
I mean, I can't go back in time.

1662
01:39:17,243 --> 01:39:19,244
Jerry?

1663
01:39:21,331 --> 01:39:23,248
Can I backdate this to last year,

1664
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:27,669
so I don't get screwed paying a bunch
of taxes on money I don't even have?

1665
01:39:27,837 --> 01:39:29,588
What did... what did you ask?

1666
01:39:29,756 --> 01:39:31,590
May I backdate this?

1667
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:41,433
Yeah, sure. I don't see what
difference it fuckin' makes.

1668
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:44,394
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

1669
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:56,948
You know, Jack, this is great.

1670
01:39:57,116 --> 01:40:01,286
I mean, straight up fuckin' great.

1671
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:03,622
I've been waitin'...

1672
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:07,918
A long time I've been waiting...

1673
01:40:14,467 --> 01:40:18,387
You think you're
so fuckin' cute cutting me out.

1674
01:40:19,138 --> 01:40:20,847
Well, now you got shit.

1675
01:40:38,324 --> 01:40:41,576
A piece of shit like that
couldn't be trusted.

1676
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,662
No, no, no, no more killing.

1677
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:46,373
- Come on, respectfully, please...
- Sit down.

1678
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:55,215
One has to be careful
when he choose his partners...

1679
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:58,301
...Mr. Harris.

1680
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:01,680
You make good things for us
all these years.

1681
01:41:01,848 --> 01:41:06,351
Sometimes business
is more important than family.

1682
01:41:09,647 --> 01:41:11,189
Now, get out.

1683
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:20,574
Clean up that mess.

1684
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:42,929
So then Jack forced us to go
with him to dump the body.

1685
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:45,974
Yeah, then he said if we
told anybody, he'd kill us.

1686
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:55,567
Where did you dump the body?

1687
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:59,404
Told you before, in the ocean.

1688
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:02,240
Jack dumped the body in the ocean.
The ocean's the ocean.

1689
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:04,493
The ocean's the ocean, huh?

1690
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:05,911
Yeah, asshole.

1691
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,957
Alejandro!

1692
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:22,886
- Where the fuck is my lawyer?
- Let's focus on why we're here,

1693
01:42:23,054 --> 01:42:25,472
'cause we're not here to talk about
dumped bodies and alleged murders.

1694
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:27,098
We're here to talk about
child pornography.

1695
01:42:27,266 --> 01:42:29,267
Jack was just as much
a part of that as we were.

1696
01:42:29,435 --> 01:42:31,186
- Just as much as you?
- Absolutely.

1697
01:42:31,354 --> 01:42:33,063
He's OK.

1698
01:42:35,608 --> 01:42:38,777
We have a contract that Jack signed
selling his shares of the company

1699
01:42:38,945 --> 01:42:40,946
six months prior
to the Denny Z business,

1700
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:43,740
but it's nice to know there's no
dispute regarding your involvement.

1701
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:45,617
So thanks for that.

1702
01:42:46,369 --> 01:42:48,829
Come on, let's get you inside.
