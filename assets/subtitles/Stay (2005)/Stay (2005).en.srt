1
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,702
Hey, watch where you're
going, you old klutz...

2
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,333
- Sorry. Sorry.
- You gonna pick that up?

3
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,344
Pervert.

4
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,074
You're late. l've been
looking all over for you.

5
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,346
l slept right through the alarm clock.
That baby kept me up all night.

6
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:10,718
- What baby?
- l don't know. Our neighbors have a kid?

7
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,348
Our neighbors are 90 years old.

8
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,959
You want to try and get
the paint on the canvas.

9
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,759
l like it messy.

10
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:24,098
Oh, yeah?
l gotta go.

11
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,474
Hey-

12
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:39,978
l just start drinking
and doing a lot of,like, pills.

13
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,318
'Cause then it just kills the pain,
and then l can just deal with it later.

14
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,922
l'm just saying- l'm not
telling you to go drink.

15
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:51,793
l know you go to meetings.
l'm just telling you what works for me, okay?

16
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:56,164
lt's hard to deal with those feelings.
Well, drinking kills feelings. That's why.

17
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,264
lt's gonna hail this afternoon.

18
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:04,571
You think?
Looks pretty sunny to me.

19
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,271
Who the fuck are you?

20
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,315
l'm Dr. Sam Foster.
You must be Henry.

21
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,850
Where's Dr. Levy?

22
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,318
Didn't she get in touch with you?

23
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,480
No.

24
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,559
Oh, l'm sorry.
She's away for a while.

25
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,356
- l'm covering for her.
- She's away where?

26
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,489
She's not feeling well.
She'll be back in a couple of weeks.

27
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,801
What are you-
a substitute shrink?

28
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,472
l guess you could call me that.

29
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,373
Oh.

30
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,639
This is her office.

31
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:45,616
Yeah, we share it. l'm only here
a few hours a week. Please take a seat.

32
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,186
Oh, l see.

33
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,156
So you treat the, uh...

34
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,352
depressed investment bankers,
paranoid housewives all week?

35
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,726
Come up here to do
a little pro bono work?

36
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,731
lt's the other way around.

37
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,735
The bankers are paranoid,
and the housewives are depressed.

38
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:11,369
Now,you're a junior at the college.
ls that right? Majoring in fine art?

39
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:18,205
She passed me off to you, huh?

40
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,885
You get the hard cases.

41
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,051
Does it make you uncomfortable
that l'm filling in for her?

42
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,393
She was trying to help me.

43
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,558
l'll try and help you too.

44
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,898
She afraid of me?
ls that why she's gone?

45
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,237
Did l scare her?

46
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,073
Should she be afraid of you?

47
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,420
l've read your file.

48
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,087
And can l read your file?

49
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,891
Tell me why you're here.

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,093
l thought you read the file.

51
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,071
You torched your car.
Why?

52
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,342
l don't remember.
l just woke up...

53
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,140
and l was in the car,
and it was on fire.

54
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:25,149
ls that something you do-
set fires?

55
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,886
l didn't mean to hurt anybody.

56
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,284
Who did you hurt?

57
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,658
l don't know.
l'm gonna go.

58
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,236
No. Please, sit down.
We have more time.

59
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,238
No, l, uh- l'm gonna go home
before this hail starts.

60
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,777
The king of Poland goes hunting
in the woods with one ofhis assistants.

61
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,778
And they're looking around...

62
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,338
and suddenly on the other side
of the clearing a farmer walks by.

63
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,918
Hold still.

64
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,180
And the king raises his rifle,
and the farmer yells...

65
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,256
''l'm not a moose.''

66
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,190
The king shoots
and kills the guy...

67
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,193
and the assistant's shocked.

68
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,559
And he says...

69
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:15,293
''Sire, the man said,
l'm not a moose.''

70
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:19,303
''Oh, says the king.
l thought he said, l am a moose.''

71
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,202
lt's a joke.

72
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,745
No, l'm just trying
to figure out...

73
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,907
if l'm the king or the farmer.

74
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,546
You're the moose.

75
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:39,614
- l'm the moose?
- Yeah.

76
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,392
Well, l appear to be the moose.

77
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,993
- lt's shit.
- lt's not shit.

78
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,170
lt's not shit.

79
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,312
Still there.

80
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,116
Sometimes l forget.

81
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,852
They're from another life.

82
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,079
Oh, my God.

83
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,958
l love this song.

84
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:02,570
l know you. Psych 221.
Professor Azzopardi?

85
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,108
You did that presentation on psychosis
and Tristan Reveur, right?

86
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,411
No smoking on the train.

87
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,086
Look at the sign, fella.
No smoking.

88
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,518
Capisce? Put it out.

89
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,028
''Capisce''?

90
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,064
Put out the fucking cigarette.

91
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,516
You oughta be locked up,
you asshole.

92
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:57,758
Beth? Sam. l hope
you're getting some rest.

93
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,626
Look, l met with your
patient today- Henry Letham.

94
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,295
l'd really like
to talk to you about him.

95
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,805
Give me a call, okay?
l wanna hear your voice.

96
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:14,276
You don't think it's a little odd-
predicting a hailstorm like that?

97
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,507
So he watches the Weather Channel.

98
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,949
No. l looked in the newspaper.
There was nothing about hail today.

99
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,388
How's Beth?

100
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:27,118
l don't know.
She hasn't returned any of my calls.

101
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,387
She always kinda
liked you, didn't she?

102
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,132
What, are you jealous?

103
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,133
Of Beth?

104
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:39,136
- l'm just faking it.
- Your students love you.

105
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,901
My students love me
'cause l give 'em all A's.

106
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:47,173
l mean, what the fuck do l know?
This kid could be the next Rothko.

107
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,422
Tell me l'm good.

108
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,431
You're good.

109
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,161
Tell me they'll remember me.

110
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,737
Who's ''they''?

111
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,329
The world.

112
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,342
ls that what you want?

113
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,709
The world will remember you.

114
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,052
Now take off your clothes.

115
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,901
Hey.

116
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,708
Who did that?

117
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,945
My girlfriend.

118
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,385
Where'd you get that?

119
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,754
This? l bought it.

120
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,290
Henry, what are you
doing here? l-

121
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,564
l wasn't expecting you.
l have someone coming in.

122
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,842
So, have you considered
a career in meteorology?

123
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,507
Hmm?

124
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:35,348
The weatherman
said something about hail?

125
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,116
The weatherman?

126
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,492
No.

127
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,323
You know, l can't even
listen to him anymore?

128
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,969
l don't understand a word
that comes out of his mouth.

129
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,301
You don't understand
the weatherman?

130
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,306
No.

131
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,839
But you do?

132
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,973
Sure. He says rain,
l bring an umbrella.

133
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,422
Henry, give me something.

134
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,892
l'm good at what l do.

135
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,193
Well, l'm hearing voices now.

136
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,197
Voices?

137
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:34,512
They come and they go,
but when they are there-

138
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,309
You're hearing them now?

139
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,577
Okay.

140
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,657
Can you write down
what they're saying?

141
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,934
- Yeah?
Hey, Dr. Foster. lt's Frederick.

142
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,276
Can you read it to me?

143
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,142
- Hmm?
- Can you read it to me?

144
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,618
Uh, yeah.

145
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,486
''Hey, Dr. Foster. lt's Frederick.''

146
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,087
This is-This voice isn't in your head.
This is a real voice.

147
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:33,265
Okay. Well, l don't know.

148
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,398
Maybe you could show me
how to tell the difference?

149
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,777
Go on.

150
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,779
l don't know.

151
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,955
''l didn't move him.
l know you're not supposed to move 'em.''

152
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,082
''l can't watch anymore.''

153
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:59,324
''Stay with me, Henry.
Stay with me.''

154
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:03,663
Hey, guys. Sorry
to interrupt, but, uh-

155
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,499
Hey, Frederick,
can you give me a minute?

156
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,802
- l've got a conference call at 11:00.
-Just a minute. Thank you.

157
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,275
Yeah, okay.

158
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,675
Where's this from?

159
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,684
Oh, l burned myself.

160
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,451
You burned yourself? Why?

161
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,320
Practicing for hell.

162
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,995
Why do you think
you're going to hell?

163
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,295
Um...

164
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,806
'cause of what l did.

165
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,640
What l'm gonna do.

166
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,373
What are you gonna do?

167
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,552
You're gonna try and kill yourself?

168
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,659
And how seriously should l take that?

169
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,457
Saturday at midnight
is when l'm gonna do it.

170
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,158
You gotta know that
everything just changed.

171
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,566
lf you talk to me about suicide,
l'm required to take certain actions.

172
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,071
Hey, look.Just wait a second.
Wait a second.

173
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,308
Just, you know, deal with him...

174
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,334
Just, you know, deal with him...

175
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:23,472
and, uh, we'll talk
about it next time.

176
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:26,016
There's a next time?

177
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,018
Yeah.

178
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,213
Yeah.

179
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,421
Yeah, we got three days.

180
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,096
He's coming! He's coming!

181
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,228
l am not a monster, goddamn you!
Get off of me!

182
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,705
Nobody's calling you a monster,
Daisy. Come on now.

183
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,039
Please! You said you would-
l don't deserve this!

184
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,512
Well, if you'd just remember to take your pills,
you wouldn't have to go through this.

185
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,608
- l'm not a monster. l'm lovable.
- l know you are.

186
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:04,280
l'm lovable. Stop!

187
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,416
- No, please! l'm lovable.
- Very lovable.

188
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,256
He's coming!
l oughta know he's coming!

189
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,889
l'll be good. l'll be good!
l don't want to- No!

190
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,899
- Hey, Sammy.
- Hey.

191
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,595
He's just a kid!
He's just a kid!

192
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,537
Okay, now.
Let go, Daisy.

193
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,972
He's just a kid!

194
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,976
He's just a kid!

195
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,638
Sorry about that.
You okay?

196
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:32,649
Yeah. Yeah. l'm used to dealing
with neurotic stockbrokers.

197
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,015
Neurotic stockbrokers pay better.

198
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,480
So, uh, what brings you
to Club Meds?

199
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,991
l have a student
threatening to kill himself.

200
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,120
Christ. Well, tell him
to take a number.

201
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,130
Look, you know how it works.

202
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,962
lf he threatens to hurt
himself or someone else...

203
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,197
then we can take him in,
but we can't hold him here forever.

204
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,364
He said he's gonna
do it on Saturday.

205
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,635
lf you take him in now,
he'll be out by then.

206
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,576
Organized kid.
He's got it all scheduled.

207
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,204
Saturday, midnight.
That's what he said.

208
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,711
We can pick him up Friday,
hold him for the weekend.

209
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,380
As you can see, it's
not a real fun process.

210
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,117
Anything you could do to avoid it?

211
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,819
- What have you got him on?
- He won't take any meds.

212
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,185
Where's my man?

213
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,820
You know what l've
been craving all day?

214
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,197
Something to drink.

215
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,205
What's the matter?
You're looking a little tense.

216
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,679
lt's nothing.

217
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,410
So tell me about nothing.

218
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,921
l'm just tired.

219
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,584
Let me make a call,
and then we can take a bath together.

220
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,062
Beth, it's Sam again.

221
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,862
Um, l hope
you're getting some rest.

222
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,734
Everyone's been asking about you.
Look, give me a call.

223
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,208
l want to speak to you about Henry Letham
and find out how you're feeling, okay?

224
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,344
Bye.

225
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,884
You sound like you're talking
to one of your patients.

226
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:51,183
- ls she sick?
- She's exhausted.

227
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,224
Exhausted?

228
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,060
Come on. We live in New York City.
Everyone's exhausted.

229
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,495
- What, is that a code word?

230
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,900
Yeah.

231
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,029
Yeah, l guess it is.

232
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,116
How's the kid with the hail?

233
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,555
Ever heard of
doctor-patient privilege?

234
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,149
What's the prediction
tomorrow? Locusts?

235
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,388
He's confused.

236
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,954
Confused?
ls that like exhausted?

237
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,262
l don't want to get
into this right now.

238
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,271
You told me about the lawyer
who thought her cat was talking to her.

239
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,466
l shouldn't have.

240
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,704
He wants to kill himself.

241
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:54,081
That's it, isn't it?
That's why you won't talk about it.

242
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,413
- He has a right to confidential counseling.
- Come on, Sam.

243
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,796
He wants to kill himself
on Saturday night.

244
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,930
At midnight, like it's a date.

245
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,102
What's so special about Saturday?

246
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,078
l didn't have time to ask.

247
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,809
Look, we can talk
about it, you know.

248
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,851
lt doesn't scare me.

249
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,218
- lt scares me.
- Yeah, l know.

250
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,292
But you have to trust me.

251
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,661
l do.

252
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,709
- Up slow,Jerry.
- Got it.

253
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,711
- Looking good, Mikey.
- Not  - Not so fast.

254
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,713
- Stop that swaying.
- Come on, Mommy. Faster.

255
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,342
Easy. Easy. Hold it!
Stay clear, you guys. Quick.

256
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,853
Wait! Wait! My balloon!

257
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,355
Sorry, kid.
lt's gone to balloon heaven.

258
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,393
Oh, that's okay, sir.
We're gonna get another one at the park.

259
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,826
- Go ahead, honey.
- Promise, Mommy?

260
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,228
All right, you guys.
Comin' your way.

261
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,460
Tristan Reveur once said...

262
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:20,664
''lf we cannot see the wind,
we can see the wind's will.''

263
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:26,441
Here, Pradilla Ortiz forces us
to imagine the wind...

264
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,536
by showing its effect
on the smoke...

265
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,048
the candle flames
and Dona Juana's veil.

266
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,847
Only the victims' faces are
visible in Goya's masterwork.

267
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:43,385
Our eyes are drawn
to the brightest spot on the canvas-

268
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:48,432
the white shirt of a doomed man
pleading for his life.

269
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,559
Behind him, the hill closing in...

270
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,969
refusing a path to escape.

271
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:59,305
- The Dead Toreador was originally
part of a larger painting...

272
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,437
lncident in a Bullfight.

273
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:07,041
After the painting was mocked
by critics and viewers...

274
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,552
Manet angrily sliced it in half...

275
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,923
removing the fallen hero
from his arena...

276
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,550
removing the fallen hero
from his arena...

277
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:18,721
and accidentally creating
one ofhis most enduring works.

278
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,560
- Hey.
- Hey.

279
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,100
How are you doing?

280
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,102
Oh, you know.

281
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:30,368
l didn't know if you'd still be coming
to class after what you told me.

282
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,376
Yeah, well, where else
am l gonna go?

283
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,378
Have you got a minute?

284
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,471
Sure.

285
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:41,040
Are any of these yours?

286
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,053
Ouch.

287
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,146
What?

288
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,691
Well, these are bad, so-

289
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:51,559
- Oh.

290
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:57,425
Do you know that Tristan Reveur quote
about bad art?

291
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:01,768
lt's ''Bad art is more tragically
beautiful than good art...

292
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,307
because it documents
human failure.''

293
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,513
Why'd do you want
to do it on Saturday?

294
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,285
lt's my 21st birthday.

295
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,948
l think the tradition
is to go out and get drunk.

296
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:22,549
Well, um, Tristan started
a different tradition.

297
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,561
What did he do?

298
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,965
He died.

299
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,193
What about your parents?

300
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,201
What about 'em?

301
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,743
Don't you think they care?

302
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,809
No.

303
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,319
Do they live around here?

304
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,253
They're over in Mahlus Gardens.

305
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,725
Mahlus Gardens-
Where is that?

306
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,388
lt's a cemetery in Jersey.

307
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:06,365
- l thought you read the file.
- l'm sorry.

308
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,371
l did.
lt didn't mention that.

309
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,408
lt's a little out of date.

310
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,410
Do you have any other family?

311
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,412
No.

312
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,573
Girlfriend?

313
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,183
You talked to her?

314
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,589
No.

315
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,559
Who is she?

316
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,696
No, you're not talking to her.

317
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,602
l thought you were talking
about this waitress...

318
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,267
in this diner l used to go to
over on Canal Street.

319
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,277
Tell me about her.

320
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:52,009
When she filled up my cup of coffee,
she would ask me how l was doing.

321
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,484
Waitress things, you know.
lt doesn't really constitute a girlfriend.

322
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,317
Did you ever get her name?

323
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,323
Yeah, it was Athena.

324
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,791
l was gonna marry her.

325
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,823
You were gonna marry her?

326
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,667
Yeah. l bought her
a ring and everything.

327
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,209
lt looked just like the one
that you got your girl.

328
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:27,778
l didn't steal your ring,
Henry, okay? l promise.

329
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,359
Yeah, l lost it.

330
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:41,430
Anyway, she's gone.

331
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,468
- She's gone?
- Yeah.

332
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,969
- Or she's somewhere else?
- What do you mean?

333
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,472
There is no somewhere else.

334
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,697
He's not going to make it.

335
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,353
- lt's beautiful.
- No.

336
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,723
lt's like the crap
tourists buy on Fifth Avenue.

337
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:52,400
- You talk with your student today?
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,466
Still wants to do it?

339
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,940
l don't feel right talking about it.

340
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,677
Talking about it with me, you mean.

341
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,522
You stopped taking your pills.

342
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,757
l've been counting.
You haven't taken one in weeks.

343
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,854
l don't need 'em anymore.

344
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,900
Well, that's a decision
we should've made together.

345
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:28,701
l can't paint on meds.

346
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,936
l can't.

347
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,941
- Well, it makes me nervous.

348
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,919
l'm not happy
you did this in secret.

349
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:48,857
Well, l'm not happy
you're counting my pills in secret.

350
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,452
We have to trust each other.

351
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,129
Hey, look at me.

352
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,672
l can't make them disappear.

353
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,906
l wish l could.

354
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,455
l made you a promise.

355
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,862
l gotta go.

356
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,633
l'll see you at home.

357
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:38,702
Henry?
Forgetting something?

358
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:45,176
- What's the matter?
- You just called me Henry.

359
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:49,845
- Baby, l think l know your name by now.
- Yeah, but you called me Henry.

360
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,651
Sam, l know who you are.
l promise.

361
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,060
Sorry.

362
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,365
Okay.

363
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:17,982
Do you get nervous?

364
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,745
Do you get nervous?

365
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,411
lt's a great part,
but she should resist more.

366
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,012
- She just takes his abuse and walks into the river.
- You should use that.

367
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,422
- All without a fight.
- Can we come and see you?

368
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,585
- Henry, that would be nice, wouldn't it?
- Yeah, Mom.

369
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:31,696
We could all go together.

370
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:32,594
We could all go together.

371
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,594
King's rook to E-3.

372
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,372
Mm-hmm.

373
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,068
How's Lila?

374
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,874
She's good. Oh,
l got something for her.

375
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,506
- Mm-hmm.
- Give me your hand.

376
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,283
Ah.

377
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,413
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

378
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,856
l hear she's a beautiful girl.

379
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,691
How long have you
been carrying that around?

380
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,389
A while.

381
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,693
What are you waiting for?

382
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,736
The fear to go away, l guess.

383
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,135
Mm.

384
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,800
How do l know she won't try again?

385
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,877
You don't know, Sam.

386
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,037
Does she make you happy?

387
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,273
Oh, yes.

388
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,078
Well, here's something that won't.

389
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,983
Knight to C-3.
Check.

390
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,079
- Oh, shit.

391
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:39,295
Do you remember the dream
of the burning boy referred to by Freud?

392
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,093
- Vaguely.
- Vaguely meaning no?

393
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,100
- Right.
- Yeah.

394
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:47,171
Well, he describes a man
whose child is dying.

395
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:50,935
The father sits by the boy's bed
night after night...

396
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,500
and after the boy is dead,
they give him a wake.

397
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:59,845
And they set up a circle of candles
around the boy's body.

398
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:03,387
And the father's exhausted.
He falls asleep.

399
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:07,356
And he dreams that his son
is standing beside him...

400
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:11,428
holding his arm
and whispering...

401
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,191
''Father, can't you see
that l'm burning?''

402
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,132
- You have a visitor?
- Henry.

403
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,226
- l can come back.
- No, no. You're all right.

404
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,362
- l don't mind.
- Do you know Dr. Patterson?

405
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,464
- No.
- Pleased to meet you.

406
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,307
What's the matter, Henry?

407
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,021
What the fuck?

408
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,389
What are you doing here?

409
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,156
We're playing chess.

410
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,459
You're dead.

411
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:52,468
- Sam?
- l watched you die.

412
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,130
Sam, we'll finish this game later.

413
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,036
Sure.

414
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,872
- Where are you going?
- Henry, take a seat.

415
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,380
- Why'd you come back?
- Do you know Leon?

416
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,383
What did he say to you?
Did he say something about me?

417
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,579
No, he didn't say anything about you.
l don't think Leon even knows you.

418
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,350
That's my father.

419
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,428
He knows me.

420
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,588
Now, listen, l've known Leon a long time.
He doesn't have any children.

421
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:23,826
Don't say that! Don't
fuckin' say that to me!

422
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:27,098
What are you doing?

423
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,673
Do you think l don't
recognize my own father?

424
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,709
- You told me your father was dead.
- He is dead.

425
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,211
He's dead, and that's him
walkin' out the fuckin' door!

426
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,942
The man walking out the door
is alive and well.

427
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,042
What's happening?

428
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:45,350
l saw all the blood,
and l watched him die.

429
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,392
l did it.

430
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:52,952
lt's my fault.

431
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:55,862
Maybe you hurt someone,
but not Leon.

432
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,629
Who did you hurt?
Your father?

433
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:03,469
l don't remember.

434
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:07,943
Sometimes we don't want to remember,
but l think you have to try.

435
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,910
Fuck you! What the fuck
do you know!

436
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:15,918
You don't know anything!
Everything you know is a fuckin' lie!

437
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,012
- All right?
- Okay.

438
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,785
Tell me what the truth is.

439
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:30,490
Your troubles will cease,
and fortune will smile upon you.

440
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:38,171
Your troubles will cease,
and fortune will smile upon you.

441
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,301
Yes, Henry.

442
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,312
Henry?

443
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,684
Henry?

444
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,788
Henry!

445
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,992
Henry!

446
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,328
Henry?

447
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,665
Henry, are you there?

448
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,189
Here we go.

449
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,216
Trouble.

450
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,583
- Henry, listen.

451
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,279
Stay with me, okay?
Listen to my voice, Henry.

452
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:34,119
- Stay with us here, all right?
- ls that your voice?

453
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,653
l didn't leave that message.

454
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:43,097
Probably someone who
sounds exactly like you.

455
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,396
So what do we do now?

456
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,403
Not much we can do
at this point.

457
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:51,532
We don't have the resources or the manpower
for a stakeout or anything like that.

458
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:54,076
l'll notify the police,
but they won't do anything.

459
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,078
Why not?

460
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,082
Because they've got more important things
to do than look for depressed college students.

461
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,913
Then l'll find him.

462
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,953
Well, if you do,
give me a call.

463
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,546
We'll pick him up for you.
But do me a favor, Sammy.

464
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,387
The kid hears voices
and carries a gun.

465
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,222
Watch your back.

466
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,966
Mommy, is that man
gonna die?

467
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,104
Come on, Bobby.
We're gonna be late.

468
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,078
You shouldn't run away from me like that,
you little monkey.

469
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,172
But is he gonna die?

470
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,021
Listen to this.

471
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:42,024
''Henry Letham has a fertile,
powerful imagination.

472
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:46,586
lf he maintains his concentration,
he will create new worlds with his art.''

473
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,461
Jim O'Shea?

474
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,660
Professor O'Shea, yeah.
How'd you know?

475
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,432
'CauseJim wants to fuck
every cute boy in his class.

476
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:59,703
- Did you ever hear of an artist
named Tristan Reveur?
- Yeah, of course.

477
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,506
- Do you like his work?
- l've never seen it. Nobody has.

478
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,104
He burned all his paintings
before he killed himself.

479
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,116
- He killed himself?
- Mm-hmm.

480
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,846
When he was 18, he told everyone
he'd live three more years...

481
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,013
then go to New York
and kill himself.

482
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,059
And that's exactly what he did.
Left a one-line note:

483
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,654
''Un suicide elegant
est l'oeuvre d'art finale.''

484
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,632
''An elegant suicide is
the ultimate work of art.''

485
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:27,033
Ah,Jesus.
He's Henry's favorite artist.

486
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,163
Of course he is.

487
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,713
Let me talk to him.

488
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,146
Talk to him?
First l've gotta find him.

489
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,243
He'll find you. He knows you can help him.
That's exactly why he keeps coming back to you.

490
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,879
Well, even if he does,
l can't let you talk to him.

491
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,015
l'd violate every rule in the book.

492
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:53,222
So violate them. You have something, Sam.
This kid trusts you.

493
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,994
But you've never stood where
he's standing right now, and he knows that.

494
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:01,731
Yeah, but l treat people every day
with conditions l've never experienced myself.

495
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,606
You know, the day l did it...

496
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:11,011
l took two razor blades
to the bathtub.

497
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:14,380
You know why?

498
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:19,013
Because l knew that
once l started to bleed, l'd get weak...

499
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:23,526
and l didn't want to drop one blade
and leave myself half done.

500
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,762
Can you imagine that?

501
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,857
Can you imagine hating
your life so much...

502
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,801
that you want to bring
a backup razor?

503
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,587
So what do l tell him?

504
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,160
There's too much beauty to quit.

505
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:03,490
Tell him that.
There's too much goddamn beauty.

506
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,180
Eat something.

507
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,115
l'm not hungry.

508
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:24,119
Eat your fortune cookie.

509
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,289
lt's yours.

510
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:44,207
''Your troubles will cease,
and fortune will smile upon you.''

511
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,970
Not a moment too soon.

512
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,013
What's the matter?

513
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,866
- Beth, it's Sam.
-  l didn't touch him.

514
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,868
- Beth? Beth?
- l know you're not supposed to move-

515
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,984
Beth?

516
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,581
Beth?

517
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,659
lt's me.

518
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,922
Are you okay?

519
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,929
l'm gonna turn on the light, okay?

520
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:55,210
l know Leon's been trying
to get through to you.

521
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,212
And Toni.

522
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,215
Oh,Jesus.

523
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:10,621
- Beth, are you gonna talk to me?

524
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,424
What do you want to talk about?

525
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,801
How are you feeling?

526
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:21,394
What do you really
wanna talk about?

527
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,702
l'm worried about you...

528
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,006
and l wanna know more
about Henry Letham.

529
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,274
l didn't touch him.

530
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,374
l know you're not
supposed to move them.

531
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,253
What does that mean?

532
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,151
What does that mean?

533
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,883
l wanna kiss you.
Do you want to play a kissing game?

534
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,392
Beth.

535
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,330
No. You're loyal.

536
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:53,767
You're a good dog.
Good, loyal dog, Sam.

537
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,230
What's her name?

538
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,241
Lila?

539
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,506
You should've let her
bleed in the bathtub.

540
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,980
- She had the right idea.
- What are you talking about?

541
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,177
lt's highly inappropriate.

542
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:13,347
You're not supposed to fuck your patients,
even the pretty ones.

543
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,482
You know the rules.

544
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:19,791
- You can't drink while you're taking these.
- Mm. Apparently l can.

545
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:23,333
No, you can't. Come on, Beth.
l want you to come take a shower.

546
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,296
Bathe the corpse.

547
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,769
We won't really be corpses
though, will we?

548
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:31,432
lt will be more
like a memory of nothing.

549
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,976
What happened to you, Beth?

550
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:38,378
- l need to sleep, please.
- No, you got too much crap in your system.

551
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,541
Are you okay to shower?

552
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:43,677
- He's watching us.
- No, we're alone.

553
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,723
- He's watching.
- Are you still talking to him?

554
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,453
- Do you know where he is?
- Ask the mother.

555
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:53,496
- The mother's dead.
- ls she?

556
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,531
Ask anyway.

557
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,658
Hello? Hello? Yeah.

558
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,998
This is Sam Foster,
Dr. Sam Foster.

559
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,665
l'm a psychiatrist. Yeah.

560
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:07,301
l'm calling about a student
named Henry Letham.

561
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,206
He is?

562
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,783
This is very strange, Mrs. Letham.

563
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:18,014
He told me you had passed-
Hello? Hello?

564
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,215
- Damn it.

565
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,558
This is it.
l won't be long.

566
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:48,216
- l've been waiting for you.

567
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,252
Mrs. Letham?

568
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:54,085
l'm Dr. Sam Foster.
l'm sorry to bother you at this hour.

569
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,489
l thought you'd never come.

570
00:44:56,593 --> 00:45:00,689
l would have come earlier.
l didn't know you were here.

571
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,995
lt's easy to forget about me...

572
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,194
all alone up here.

573
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,602
Your son's not well.
That's why l'm here.

574
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,607
l'm trying to find him.

575
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,304
l'm sorry to say he's threatened
to commit suicide.

576
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:19,712
You came to see Olive,
didn't you? Not me.

577
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,876
Olive?

578
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:26,115
There she is.
She's been lonely.

579
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,124
Me and Olive
keep each other company.

580
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,889
We've been alone in this house
for a thousand years.

581
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,625
Hey, Olive.

582
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,101
How are you doing, girl?

583
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,934
She doesn't remember you.

584
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:48,938
- Are you hungry?
- No.

585
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:51,241
Do you know
how to contact your son?

586
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,976
Are there any relatives or friends
he might have gone to see?

587
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,781
Let me fix you something to eat.

588
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:02,484
You stay with Olive.
There's some leftovers in the fridge.

589
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:08,156
Most days l don't say
a single word.

590
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:12,099
Sometimes l'm silent so long,
l forget how to speak.

591
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:20,604
Mrs. Letham,
we have an emergency here.

592
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,611
You-

593
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,546
Do you hate me?

594
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,108
You must hate me.

595
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,615
ls that why you did it?

596
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,953
No, l don't hate you.

597
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:39,224
l'm here because
your son needs help.

598
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,399
l knew you'd come eventually.

599
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,095
lt's been quiet without you.
Lonely.

600
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:51,504
Mrs. Letham, who do you think l am?

601
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,907
Don't play games.
Not anymore.

602
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:57,071
Who am l?

603
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,911
You think l don't
know you, Henry?

604
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:03,077
You think l don't
recognize my only son?

605
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:07,715
Oh, Lord, l've missed you.
l've missed you so much.

606
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,961
l know you never
meant to hurt us.

607
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:15,395
- Mom?
- Yes, baby.

608
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,967
How did l hurt you?

609
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:22,596
lt doesn't matter anymore.
l could never stay angry with you.

610
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,609
What do l do on Saturdays?

611
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:33,474
When you were a boy,
you used to go to the zoo.

612
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:39,079
Remember? You loved
to watch the walrus swim.

613
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,589
But l'm older now.

614
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,890
lt's my 21st birthday tomorrow.
What'll l do for my birthday?

615
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:52,457
Who knows?
You don't tell me anything these days.

616
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,538
l guess you tell Athena
your secrets now.

617
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:59,541
Athena?
Do you remember where Athena lives?

618
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,873
Dogs are a big responsibility, darling.

619
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:05,244
- Look at the mess l'm making.

620
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,147
- l just have to clean it up.
- Let me see your head.

621
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,277
- You don't want to see.
- Mrs. Letham.

622
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,049
You didn't mean to hurt anyone.
You know you didn't.

623
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:15,647
Let me look at your head.
That's a serious wound.

624
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:19,422
- Don't look at me, darling. Don't-

625
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,759
- Olive, off!.

626
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:25,392
- Olive, off!.

627
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:27,595
Let me fix you something to eat.

628
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,808
You're a bleeder, huh?

629
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,140
Here, maintain pressure on that.

630
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:41,541
Dr. Foster?
Could l have a word with you?

631
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:47,256
Yeah,you got bit up pretty good.

632
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:50,656
- Get your rabies shot already?
- Yeah.

633
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:56,926
Look, l'm, uh-
l'm Sheriff Kennelly.

634
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,333
Now, l-l know you already
spoke with Deputy Carlyle...

635
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:04,168
but l just wanted
to confirm a few things.

636
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:09,177
You said the, uh- the assault took place
at 9625 Rickover Street?

637
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,214
- That's right.
- The home belonging to the Letham family?

638
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:15,877
Right. Her dog attacked me,
and... she needs some help.

639
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,511
She has a severe head wound.
She should be in a hospital.

640
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,817
l went to high school
with Maureen Letham.

641
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:24,291
Oh, yeah? Maybe you know her son, Henry.
He's a patient of mine.

642
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:27,830
l remember Henry.
Pale, skinny kid, always drawing pictures.

643
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:31,025
- Yeah, that's him.
- He kind of gave me the creeps.

644
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,694
What's strange, Doctor-

645
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,170
What l'm trying to figure out is...

646
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:40,004
who you were speaking with
over there at 9625 Rickover Street.

647
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,238
l'm sorry. l thought we already
established Maureen Letham.

648
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:46,077
She told you her name
was Maureen Letham?

649
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,208
Yeah. We were talking
about her son.

650
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,752
She wasn't entirely coherent.
She needs medical assistance.

651
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:53,652
But why did you want to talk
to this woman at 1:00 in the morning?

652
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:56,419
Look, l'm treating her son.
lt's an emergency situation.

653
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:59,893
The- Sheriff, she needs help.
She's lost a lot of blood.

654
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,758
l told you l went to school
with Maureen Letham.

655
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,428
l also went to her funeral.

656
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:10,597
She's been dead for months.

657
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:13,198
Car wreck-
her and her husband.

658
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:17,144
As far as l know, that house is empty still.
The family's trying to sell it.

659
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,410
l spoke to Maureen Letham
an hour ago.

660
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,918
lt's probably just
someone's confused.

661
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,048
So how long they keeping you here?

662
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:32,060
l don't know. l gotta head back into the city.
Look, 9625 Rickover Street.

663
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:35,222
l was there.
Henry's mother was there.

664
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,823
All right, Dr. Foster.

665
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:40,630
We'll be in touch.
l've got your number.

666
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:48,134
Sheriff?

667
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,573
Sheriff?

668
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:55,116
- Uh-huh.
- Mrs. Letham-

669
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,209
Did she have brown eyes?

670
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,812
Oh, no, sir.
Bluest eyes in town.

671
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:49,534
No, no, no, no, no.

672
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,938
- Doing good. Up slow,Jerry.
- Mommy, hurry up!

673
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,474
- l got it.
- Not so fast.

674
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:34,377
- Stop that sway. Easy.
- Come on, Mommy. Faster.

675
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:34,968
- Stop that sway. Easy.
- Come on, Mommy. Faster.

676
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:38,377
- Hold it. Stay clear, you guys.
- Oh! Wait. Wait!

677
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,211
My balloon!

678
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,309
Sorry, kid.
lt's gone to balloon heaven.

679
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,287
That's okay, sir. We're gonna
get another one at the park.

680
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,323
- Go ahead, honey.
- Promise, Mommy?

681
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:51,553
Comin'at you, guys.
Comin'your way.

682
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:55,392
You were here on Thursday, right?
You were moving the piano on Thursday too, right?

683
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,966
-Can l help you with something?
-Yeah, the kid and the balloon-

684
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,299
- The same thing happened on Thursday, right?
- We're a little busy here.

685
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,372
Why don't you go bother
someone else, huh?

686
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:07,637
Your way, guys! There you go.
Watch that thing. That's it.

687
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,349
Christ!
Where have you been?

688
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,445
What happened to you?

689
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:22,923
l've been calling people all over the city,
looking for you.

690
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:27,292
- l was about to call the police.
What happened to you?

691
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:30,798
l've been calling people all over the city,
looking for you.

692
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,198
Christ!
Where have you been?

693
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:35,771
l've been calling people all over the city,
looking for you.

694
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:39,035
l was about to call the police.
What's going on, Sam?

695
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:42,236
- l don't know.
- No, you've gotta talk to me. l've been up all night.

696
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:44,245
- What happened to your arm?
- Dog bite.

697
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:46,577
- Dog bite?
- Yeah, l had the shots and the painkillers.

698
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:49,413
- What dog? Where?
- Look, l'm seeing things
that don't make any sense...

699
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,680
and l'm meeting people that
are supposed to be dead...

700
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,688
and Beth's had
a nervous breakdown.

701
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,691
The kid l'm treating knows
what's gonna happen before it happens.

702
00:54:56,793 --> 00:55:00,524
- Okay,just slow down.
- And l saw the same boy
lose the same balloon twice.

703
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,497
- Baby, you're not making any sense.
- No, nothing makes any sense.

704
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,830
- You're scaring me.
- Nothing makes any sense.

705
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:09,132
Okay. You just need
to relax. Slow down.

706
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,173
- Okay.
- Hey, you need to sleep.

707
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:14,141
Yeah. No, l can't.

708
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,644
- l gotta find him. l'm running out of time.
- No, no.

709
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:19,214
-Just for a while. Lie down.
- You think?

710
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,376
All right. All right.

711
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,976
Maybe just for a little bit.

712
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,921
- Okay.

713
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,652
Maybe just a little bit.

714
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,807
Jesus Christ.

715
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,543
l've been looking all over for you.

716
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,752
l want you to come uptown with me.
l want you to meet a friend of mine.

717
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,623
l don't wanna go uptown.

718
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:42,457
l met your mother last night.

719
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,834
What do you mean,
you met my mother?

720
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,234
You told me she was dead.

721
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:51,398
She's okay?

722
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,271
Yeah, everyone seems to think
your mother's dead...

723
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:55,537
but l'm standing in a kitchen
talking to her.

724
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:57,442
Sh-She's gonna be okay?

725
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,345
l don't know. She's sick.
She got hurt somehow. l don't know.

726
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,782
ls she mad?

727
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:05,354
- The dog seemed pretty fuckin' mad.
- What dog?

728
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:09,323
- Olive.
- Olive?

729
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,394
Yeah, we put Olive
to sleep when l was 12.

730
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,359
She had a tumor in her liver.

731
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:16,762
Well, Olive's not dead.
She is very much not dead.

732
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,857
Yeah, she is.
But she was a good girl.

733
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:21,630
Quit playing with me.
l wanna know what's going on.

734
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:25,697
How do you know the future?
l wanna help you, but-

735
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,544
- l need some fuckin' answers!
- What happened to your parents?

736
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,068
- l need some fuckin' answers!
- What happened to your parents?

737
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:37,951
Look, there are things that you have to tell me.
l mean, l mean...

738
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,614
if you were just gonna
kill yourself, you'd have done it by now.

739
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:43,715
So why haven't you?

740
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:47,228
Why do you keep coming to me?

741
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,567
'Cause you're the only one
that can help me.

742
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,363
That's why.

743
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:09,586
Henry? Henry?

744
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,178
Henry? Henry?

745
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,255
l've seen people go through
what you're going through.

746
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:18,187
l've helped them come out
the other side.

747
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,524
lf you work with me,
l can help you.

748
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,698
The way you helped your girl?

749
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:31,971
lt's Lila, right?

750
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:37,309
l've seen the, uh,
scars on her wrists.

751
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,375
Did you save her?

752
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,525
She saved herself.

753
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:57,191
Yeah, but you helped, right?

754
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:03,498
No. Sometimes suicide is an attempt
for attention. With Lila it wasn't.

755
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:06,769
She put three four-inch vertical slits
in each wrist.

756
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:10,039
She split both sets of ulnar
and radial arteries.

757
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:14,173
By the time l got to her,
she'd lost five pints of blood.

758
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:17,549
l just pulled her out of the bathtub,
put tourniquets on both arms...

759
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:20,487
and called an ambulance.

760
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,888
Aren't you afraid
she's gonna do it again?

761
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,922
No.

762
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,930
Why?

763
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,500
'Cause she loves me.

764
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:40,234
lf she were here,
l know she'd say...

765
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:42,868
to open your eyes a little wider.

766
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:48,916
l know she'd tell you that
there's too much beauty to quit.

767
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,527
She's probably right.

768
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:05,757
Anyway... it's too late.

769
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,362
Henry?

770
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,372
l can't let you leave this time.

771
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,840
You gotta stay with me.
l gotta take you uptown to meet this-

772
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,877
- Get the fuck outta my way.
- No, you gotta come with me to the-

773
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:19,039
- Get outta my way, all right? Move. Move.
- l can't.

774
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,981
- l can't let you-
- Let me show you something.

775
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:30,450
l killed my parents.

776
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:37,123
l killed my mother and my father.

777
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,471
l'm gonna go to hell.

778
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:49,644
Or maybe l'm already there.
l don't know.

779
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,851
l'm sorry, Sam.

780
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:04,158
Don't follow me.

781
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,445
Canal Street.
A diner.

782
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:34,523
Canal Street. A diner. Yeah, which diner?
There's maybe 20.

783
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:37,787
l don't know, pick one.
Keep the meter running.

784
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:55,639
Excuse me.
Do you have an Athena working here?

785
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:58,236
Yeah. Athena!

786
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:00,713
- Yeah, what?
- Athena?

787
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:03,513
What? What do you want?

788
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:06,713
All right, next one.
All right, next one.

789
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,591
All right, next one.

790
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,690
All right.

791
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,700
There's one more.

792
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,973
We're running out of options here.
l really don't know what you want.

793
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,638
All right.
Just try one more, please.

794
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:51,724
Excuse me.
Do you have a waitress here named Athena?

795
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,301
- Athena?
- Yeah.

796
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:56,860
No, never heard of her.

797
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:01,075
- Can l get a coffee, please?
- Sure.

798
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,289
Planning on proposing to Athena?

799
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:23,559
No. Do you know her?

800
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:27,727
- Are we talking about the same girl?
- You a cop?

801
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,306
No, l'm more of a matchmaker.

802
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:34,934
Doesn't work here anymore.
But she's in my acting class.

803
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:39,307
She is?
Could you tell me where she lives?

804
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:41,246
What are you, her stalker?

805
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,786
No. No.

806
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:48,015
- l'm a psychiatrist.

807
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:50,149
See?

808
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:54,525
A psychiatrist, huh?
So you could write a Xanax prescription.

809
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,360
l could write
a Xanax prescription...

810
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:00,094
for one of my patients
who needed it, yeah.

811
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:02,137
Okay.

812
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:04,263
Good luck finding Athena.

813
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,544
- Prison, my lord?
- Denmark's a prison.

814
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:13,410
- Then is the world one?
- A goodly one...

815
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,349
in which there are many confines,
wards and dungeons.

816
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:19,046
Denmark being one of the worst.

817
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:21,055
We think not so, my lord.

818
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:24,024
Well, then 'tis none to you,
for there is nothing either good or bad...

819
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:26,026
but thinking makes it so.

820
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,790
To me, it is a prison.

821
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:31,230
- Prison, my lord?
- Denmark's a prison.

822
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,962
- We already had this conversation.
- Oh, um, uh, wait a minute.

823
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:38,302
Uh, um-

824
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:42,309
- ''Why then your ambition''-
- Why then your ambition makes it one.

825
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,470
'Tis too narrow for your mind.

826
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,480
l could be bounded
in a nutshell...

827
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:49,016
and count myself
a king of infinite space...

828
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:52,349
were it not
that l have bad dreams.

829
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:56,482
- That's my favorite line in the whole play.
- lt's a good line.

830
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:59,026
However, my favorite line
of the play is:

831
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:02,962
''O what a rogue
and peasant slave am l.''

832
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:06,899
l have no idea what any of it means,
but l love the word ''slave''.

833
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:10,131
l love it. l gotta go.

834
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:14,039
- l've got a solo in choir tomorrow morning.
- Thanks for reading with me.

835
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:18,739
- You're a good Rosencrantz.
- l know. Bye.

836
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,284
- Hello.
- Hi.

837
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:31,017
l always pictured Hamlet as a man.

838
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:34,062
That's a bit narrow-minded
of you, isn't it?

839
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:37,291
This is the lesbian Hamlet.
All the parts are played by women.

840
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,630
- Oh.
- l'm joking.

841
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:43,364
l'm Ophelia.
l just get so sick of playing her.

842
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:46,339
Things get tough,
she jumps in the drink.

843
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,933
Hamlet hogs all the good lines.

844
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:51,036
Well, he's notorious for that.

845
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:53,445
We've met before, haven't we?

846
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:56,746
No, l don't think so.
l'm Sam Foster.

847
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,319
- Athena.
- Hi.

848
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,981
Hi. Are you joining the class?

849
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,650
No. l've been looking for you,
as a matter of fact.

850
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:06,387
That's flattering. Why?

851
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:10,761
l'm a psychiatrist,
and l have a patient who, uh...

852
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,630
likes you very much.

853
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:16,728
That's an unusual way
of trying to get a date.

854
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:20,007
- What's his name?
- Henry Letham.

855
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:22,839
- Sounds familiar.
- You served him coffee in a diner a couple of times.

856
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:25,914
You were nice to him. But the way
he tells it, you're the one good thing...

857
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:28,506
that ever happened to him.

858
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:31,450
Henry.
ls he very pale, very thin?

859
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:34,614
- His arms are scarred.
- Yeah, that's him.

860
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,625
He always ate pecan pie with his coffee.
l remember that.

861
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,627
But l never spoke to him
outside the diner.

862
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,788
- Oh.
- Except-

863
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:43,922
Yeah? What?

864
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:46,831
l feel really stupid saying this stuff
to a psychiatrist.

865
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:49,131
- You'll think l'm insane.
- No.

866
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,634
l had the strangest feeling
about him.

867
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,767
l mean, he's this
ragged-looking guy.

868
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:58,369
Probably hasn't bathed in months,
but something about him.

869
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:01,973
l'd seen him before.
Somewhere.

870
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,678
l'd known him.

871
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:08,848
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with him?

872
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,859
He's going to kill himself.

873
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,690
Why?

874
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:17,323
He thinks he's done something terrible.
That's my guess anyway.

875
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:20,834
l wish there was something
l could do to help.

876
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:25,566
Actually, this probably won't help,
but l did run into him one time at A. Smith's.

877
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:27,369
- A. Smith's?
- The art bookstore?

878
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,535
He was sitting in the back, reading.

879
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:31,545
l don't know.
Maybe he hangs out there.

880
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:34,343
- Where is it?
- Nearby. Come on. l'll show you.

881
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,016
Athena?

882
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:10,585
Athena?

883
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:16,722
Athena!

884
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,953
Athena?

885
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:22,394
Athena! Athena!

886
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:31,901
l'm just trying
to figure out if l'm the king or the farmer.

887
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:45,382
Still there.

888
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:09,740
- Athena?
- We think not, my lord.

889
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:12,780
Well, then 'tis none to you,
for there is nothing either good or bad...

890
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,474
but thinking makes it so.

891
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,746
- To me, it is a prison.
- Prison, my lord?

892
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:20,287
Denmark's a prison.
We already had this conversation.

893
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:35,597
Sonny Rollins. Hmm.

894
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,709
Ah.

895
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,050
- Are you lonely here?
- Who's that?

896
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:57,216
- Who's there?

897
01:09:57,326 --> 01:10:00,693
- Why isn't Mom with you?

898
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:03,196
l'll call the police.

899
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:05,665
Put the phone down, Dad.

900
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:08,861
lt's Henry.

901
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:14,409
Henry?
What are you doing here?

902
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,172
Just wanted to see you
one more time.

903
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:33,057
Henry.

904
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,722
l need you to leave now.

905
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:41,300
You can't sneak
into people's homes.

906
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,100
l don't wanna go, Dad.

907
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:50,042
You've got the wrong man.

908
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:53,239
l've told you before.

909
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:55,214
l don't wanna die.

910
01:10:55,317 --> 01:11:00,220
You don't have to die.

911
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,882
- Will you do something for me, Dad?
- What?

912
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,961
- What are you doing?
- lt's okay. lt's okay.

913
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:10,060
l want you to look at me, okay?

914
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,635
Just look at me.

915
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:49,803
- lt's just lightning.

916
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:55,801
Remember that time we found
all those dead sparrows in the yard?

917
01:11:55,911 --> 01:12:00,177
Do you remember that?
They were in that tree that got hit by lightning.

918
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,849
Who are you?

919
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,021
l'm your son.

920
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:12,752
No. No.

921
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,131
Tell Mom l love her, all right?

922
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:50,995
You should show your mother your paintings.

923
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,694
- Yeah, well,you know...

924
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,895
Doesn't Athena look beautiful tonight?

925
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:58,802
- They remind me of us when
we met all those years ago.

926
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:00,807
- Yeah.

927
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:03,969
How have you guys stayed
so in love after all these years?

928
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:04,980
- Well, it's simple-

929
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,379
- Well, it's simple-

930
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:04,871
We're closed.

931
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:07,567
Ben, let him in.
See what he wants.

932
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:12,370
- All right.

933
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:18,452
Can l help you find something?

934
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,249
Henry Letham.

935
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:22,880
A book by Henry Letham
or on Henry Letham?

936
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:25,255
No, l-l thought
he might be here.

937
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,760
l was told he comes here sometimes.

938
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:30,889
Nobody's here, man,
'cause the store is closed.

939
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,433
How about you don't
fuck with me right now?

940
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:39,997
- Smitty, you know a guy named Henry Letham?
- Sure.

941
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:43,407
- Something happen to him?
- Yeah, l need to find him.

942
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,776
l keep telling the kid
to get some sun.

943
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:50,477
lt's not healthy spending all your time
in bookstores. Yeah, that's his.

944
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:53,919
He didn't have any money to pay for the books
he wanted, so he gave me this.

945
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:57,321
l think l got a pretty good deal.
The kid's got talent, huh?

946
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,417
He traded the painting for some books?
Which books?

947
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:01,428
Tristan Reveur.
What else?

948
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,464
The kid's obsessed with Reveur.

949
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,931
- You got any more of his books?
- No, he bought me out.

950
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:08,764
lt's all secondhand,
out-of-print stuff.

951
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:12,932
Right. Thanks.

952
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:15,635
So, what do you think?
ls he gonna make it?

953
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,837
What?

954
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:21,677
You think he's got what it takes?

955
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:26,886
Yeah. Yeah.

956
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:39,252
- Hello?
- lt's me.

957
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:42,323
Jesus, Sam, where are you?
Are you okay?

958
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:46,087
l'm fine. Listen. Tristan Reveur killed himself
on his 21st birthday, right?

959
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:49,891
Oh, God, it's that kid's
21st birthday today.

960
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:52,330
Yeah.
How'd he kill himself?

961
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:55,301
Um, he shot himself
on the Brooklyn Bridge.

962
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:59,864
He said it was the best artwork
of the 19th century.

963
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:02,603
- Hello?
- Lila, listen.

964
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:05,373
l need you to know something.
l trust you.

965
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,972
- l trust you more than anyone in the world.
- What's going on, Sam?

966
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:11,450
Listen, if anything happens tonight,
you know l love you.

967
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:13,384
lt's the one thing l know is real.

968
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:15,479
l'm worried about you.

969
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:18,559
Don't be.
l love you, Lila.

970
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,560
- Sam?

971
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:28,125
- Leon?
- l always thought you had brown eyes.

972
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:37,207
- You can see.
- l can see everything.

973
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:40,145
- For the first time, l can see everything.
- But how?

974
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:42,216
Henry.
lt's all because of Henry.

975
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,614
What's happening to us?

976
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,245
The Buddhists had it right
all along.

977
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:23,551
The world is an illusion.

978
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,689
- What time is it?
- lt's 11:33.

979
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:31,391
Check.

980
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,870
Saturday night in the rain!

981
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:35,598
Saturday night in the rain!

982
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:38,639
You'll never find a cab.

983
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:03,329
Damn it.

984
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:30,755
Listen to my voice, Henry. Stay with me, okay?

985
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:53,045
Mommy, is that man gonna die?

986
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:56,811
Well, l hope not, baby. l don't think so.

987
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:49,226
- Brooklyn Bridge-

988
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:24,764
Henry.

989
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:43,608
One of the first times l met you...

990
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:46,516
you said...

991
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,123
that you didn't know
what was real anymore.

992
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:49,613
that you didn't know
what was real anymore.

993
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:51,658
And l said that l did.

994
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,785
But l was wrong.

995
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:58,789
l don't know what's real anymore.

996
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:02,435
You are.

997
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:06,633
You're real.

998
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:09,710
And you're trying to save me.
You're just too late.

999
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:13,710
'Cause l gotta wake up.

1000
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:18,017
You are awake.

1001
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:28,390
Henry, look around you.

1002
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:35,364
lf this is a dream,
the whole world's inside it.

1003
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:53,152
This hurts too much.

1004
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:59,459
- l wish you didn't have to see this.
- Henry.

1005
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:26,042
lt happened in front of me. lt was right
in front of me. l was the first one here.

1006
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:28,816
- l didn't move him. l know
you're not supposed to move them.
- Do you have a phone?

1007
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:31,289
l already called.

1008
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:35,921
Here, let me help.
l'm a nurse.

1009
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:39,431
He's losing a lot of blood.
l'm gonna straighten up his face, all right?

1010
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:43,663
Okay, maintain pressure on that.
Keep an eye on his pulse.

1011
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:48,703
Can you hear me?

1012
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:51,574
-  Should l-
- lt's okay.

1013
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,983
You're gonna be all right.

1014
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,656
You're gonna be fine.

1015
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:10,663
lt's okay.

1016
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:21,036
- How are the others?
- They're gone.

1017
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:44,831
- You said you were a nurse?
- Yeah.

1018
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:46,525
- What's your name?
- Lila.

1019
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:48,534
Now listen, listen.
Lila here's a nurse.

1020
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,002
l want you to listen
to her voice, all right?

1021
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:52,970
- Okay.
