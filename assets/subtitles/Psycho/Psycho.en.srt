you're taking the rest of the afternoon off?

Hotels of this sort aren't interested
in you when you come in,

but when your time is up. . .

13

Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

14
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,730
I've heard of married couples
who deliberately spend

15
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:52,981
an occasional night in a cheap hotel.

16
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,360
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

17

-Yeah? For what?
-For this.

20
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,498
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

21

-I can come down next week.
-No.

Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

a big steak for three.

31
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,622
And after the steak,

32
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:53,292
do we send sister to the movies,
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

I want to see you.

And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

Oh, no, I'm all for it.

It requires patience, temperance,
a lot of sweating out.

Otherwise, though, it's just hard work.

41

But if I can see you and touch you,
even as simply as this, I won't mind.

42

I'm tired of sweating for people
who aren't there.

43
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:39,045
I sweat to pay off my father's debts,
and he's in his grave.

44
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,338
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,

45
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:44,134
and she's living on the other side
of the world somewhere.

46
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,346
I pay, too.

47
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,433
They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.

48
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,855
A couple of years
and my debts will be paid off.

49
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,524
If she ever remarries, the alimony stops.

50
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:02,987
-I haven't even been married once yet.
-Yeah. But when you do, you'll swing.

Oh, Sam, let's get married.

Yeah. And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

We'll have lots of laughs. I'll tell you what.

you can lick the stamps.

170
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:41,304
And meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

171
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,347
-You want some coffee? I was just about. . .
-No, thank you.

172
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,808
I'm in a hurry
and I just wanna make a change.

173
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,352
One thing people never ought to be

174
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:49,395
when they're buying used cars
and that's in a hurry.

175
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,400
But like I said, it's too nice a day to argue.
I'll shoot your car in the garage here.

(STARTS ENGINE)

178
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,883
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

179
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,092
-How much?
-Go ahead.

180
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:21,678
-Spin it around the block.
-It looks fine.

181
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:23,721
How much would it be with my car?

182
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,893
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

183
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,936
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasing you?

184
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,980
Of course not. Please.

185
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:37,777
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high-pressured the salesman.

186
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,989
I figure roughly

187
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,701
your car plus $700.

188
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,332
-$700.
-You always got time to argue money, huh?

189
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,917
All right.

190
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,424
I take it you can prove that car is yours.

191
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,470
I mean, out-of-state licence and all.
You got your pink slip. . .

192
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:07,348
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies' room?

193
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,058
In the building.

194
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,738
Over there.

195
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,213
I think you better take it for a trial spin.

196
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,883
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

197
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,970
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this and. . .

198
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,596
I might as well be perfectly
honest with you, ma'am.

199
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,392
-It's not that I don't trust you, but. . .
-But what?

200
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,309
Is there anything so terribly wrong

201
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,355
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

202
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:40,607
-Do you think I've stolen my car?
-No, ma'am.

203
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,944

CALIFORNIA CHARLIE'S VOICE:
Heck, Officer,

209
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,549
that was the first time
l ever saw the customer

210
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,844
high-pressure the salesman.

211
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,805
Somebody chasing her?

212
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,932
OFFICER: l better have a look
at those papers, Charlie.

213
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,184
CALIFORNIA CHARLIE:
She look like a wrong one to you?

214
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,519
OFFICER: Acted like one.

215
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,565
CALIFORNIA CHARLIE: The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.

216
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,412
CAROLINE: Yes, Mr Lowery.
LOWERY: Caroline, Marion still isn't in?

217
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,958
CAROLINE: No, Mr Lowery, but then
she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.

218
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,584
LOWERY: Buzz me the minute she comes in.

219
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,964
And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.

220
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,424
CAROLINE: l called her sister, Mr Lowery,
where she works,

221
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,510
the Music Makers Music Store, you know,

222
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,221
and she doesn't know where Marion is
any more than we do.

223
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,472
LOWERY: You better run out to the house.

224
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,101
She may be,
well, unable to answer the phone.

225
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:41,061
CAROLINE: Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

226
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,484
LOWERY: No, l haven't the faintest idea.

227
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,488
As l said, l last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

228
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:54,116
She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and l said she could.

229
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,202
That was the last l saw... Oh, wait a minute.

230
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,123
l did see her some time later, driving...

231
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,586
l think you'd better come over here
to my office, quick.

232
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,255
Caroline, get Mr Cassidy for me.

233
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:13,553
After all, Cassidy, l told you, all that cash!

234
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,221
l'm not taking the responsibility.

235
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:17,848
Oh, for heaven's sake.

236
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:20,894
A girl works for you for 1 0 years,
you trust her.

237
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,936
All right, yes, you better come over.

238
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:28,401
CASSIDY: Well, l ain't about
to kiss off $40,000!

239
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:32,529
l'll get it back, and if any of it's missing,
l'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh!

240
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,532
-l'll track her, never you doubt it.
-LOWERY: Hold on, Cassidy.

241
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:41,038
l still can't believe...
lt must be some kind of a mystery. l can't...

242
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,334
You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?

243
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:48,421
You still trusting? Hot creepers!
She sat there while l dumped it out!

244
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:52,967
Hardly even looked at it. Planning.
And even flirting with me!

245
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:57,799
(HONKING HORN)

246
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,115
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you
in all this rain.

247
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,991
Go ahead in, please.

248
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,125
-Dirty night.
-You have a vacancy?

249
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,128
Oh, we have 1 2 vacancies.
Twelve cabins, 1 2 vacancies.

250
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,132
They. . . They moved away the highway.

251
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,802
Oh, I thought I'd gotten off the main road.

252
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,055
I knew you must have.

253
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:47,682
Nobody ever stops here any more
unless they've done that.

254
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,063
But there's no sense dwelling on our losses.

255
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:56,317
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

256
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,324
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,923
Cabin One.
It's closer in case you want anything.

259
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,215
Right next to the office.

260
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:23,260
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

261
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:27,097
Well, there's a big diner about 1 0 miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

262
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:31,352
-Am I that close to Fairvale?
-Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

(UNLOCKING DOOR)

264
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,539
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

265
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:00,798
Well, the mattress is soft

266
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,510
and there's hangers in the closet and
stationery with Bates Motel printed on it

267
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,972
in case you wanna make
your friends back home feel envious.

268
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,557
And the. . .

269
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,313
-Over there.
-The bathroom.

270
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,939
Yeah.

271
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:22,028
Well, if you want anything,
just tap on the wall.

272
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,404
-I'll be in the office.
-Thank you, Mr Bates.

Norman Bates.

274
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,997
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

275
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,332
No.

276
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,335
Well, then would you do me a favour?
Would you have dinner with me?

277
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,877
I was just about to myself.

278
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:41,297
You know, nothing special,
just sandwiches and milk.

279
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:45,050
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

280
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,931
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

281
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,432
-I'd like to.
-All right.

282
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,185
You get yourself settled
and take off your wet shoes,

283
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:57,020
and I'll be back as soon as it's ready.

284
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,314
Okay.

285
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,691

MRS. BATES: No! I tell you no!

288
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,820
I won't have you bringing
strange young girls in for supper!

289
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:32,240
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion

290
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,660
of young men with cheap, erotic minds!

291
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,369
NORMAN: Mother, please.

292
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,624
MRS. BATES: And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?

293
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:43,001
NORMAN: Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

294
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:48,465
MRS. BATES: "Mother, she's just a stranger."
As if men don't desire strangers. As if. . .

295
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,761
(SHUDDERING) I refuse to speak of
disgusting things, because they disgust me!

296
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,138
You understand, boy? Go on.

297
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,392
Go tell her she'll not be appeasing
her ugly appetite

298
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,894
with my food or my son !

299
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,315
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

300
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:07,984
-Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
-NORMAN: Shut up! Shut up!

She isn't quite herself today.

307
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,751
You shouldn't have bothered.
I really don't have that much of an appetite.

308
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,297
Oh, I'm sorry.

309
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,927
I wish you could apologise for other people.

310
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,264
Don't worry about it.

311
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,934
But as long as you've fixed a supper,
we may as well eat it.

312
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,990
It might be nicer and warmer in the office.

313
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:53,132
Well, it stopped raining.

314
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:55,760
Eating in an office is just too officious.

-All right.

-Sit down.
-Thank you.

318
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,036
You're very kind.

319
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:27,373
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

320
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,217
You. . . You eat like a bird.

321
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,804
And you'd know, of course.

322
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:42,097
No, not really.

323
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:45,559
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"

324
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,730
is really a false. . . Falsity.

325
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,525
Because birds really eat a tremendous lot.

326
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,697
But I don't really know
anything about birds.

327
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,617
My hobby is stuffing things.

328
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,536
You know, taxidermy.

329
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,581
And I guess
I'd just rather stuff birds because

330
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,835
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

331
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,878
You know, foxes and chimps.

332
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:16,882
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

333
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,885
I think only birds look
well stuffed because. . .

334
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:23,429
Well, because they're
kind of passive to begin with.

335
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,891
It's a strange hobby. Curious.

336
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:30,353
-Uncommon, too.
-Oh, I imagine so.

337
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:34,440
And it's not as expensive as you'd think.
It's cheap, really.

338
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,068
You know, needles and thread, sawdust.

339
00:36:37,152 --> 00:36:39,905
The chemicals are the only thing
that cost anything.

340
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,074
A man should have a hobby.

341
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:46,661
Well, it's. . . It's more than a hobby.

342
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:52,041
A hobby's supposed to pass the time,
not fill it.

343
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,753
Is your time so empty?

344
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:55,963
No.

345
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,925
Well, I run the office

346
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,427
and tend the cabins and grounds

347
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,222
and do little errands for my mother.

348
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,641
The ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

349
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:11,353
Do you go out with friends?

350
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,233
Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.

351
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:23,449
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

352
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:28,661
-Only my share.
-Where are you going?

353
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,541
I didn't mean to pry.

354
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,045
I'm looking for a private island.

355
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,797
What are you running away from?

356
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:44,385
-Why do you ask that?
-I don't know.

357
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,974
People never run away from anything.

358
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,313
The rain didn't last long, did it?
You know what I think?

359
00:37:56,523 --> 00:37:58,108
I think that

360
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,820
we're all in our private traps,

361
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,867
clamped in them,
and none of us can ever get out.

362
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:11,454
We scratch and claw,

363
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,083
but only at the air, only at each other.

364
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,545
And for all of it, we never budge an inch.

365
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,925
Sometimes we deliberately step
into those traps.

366
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,347
I was born in mine. I don't mind it any more.

367
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:32,101
Oh, but you should. You should mind it.

368
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,394
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

369
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:41,568
You know, if anyone ever
talked to me the way I heard,

370
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,405
the way she spoke to you. . .

371
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,201
Sometimes when she talks to me like that,

372
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:54,248
I feel I'd like to go up there
and curse her and leave her forever.

373
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,750
Or at least defy her.

374
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,172
But I know I can't.

375
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,260
She's ill.

376
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,594
She sounded strong.

377
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,431
No, I mean ill.

378
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,353
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

379
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:21,025
I was only five and it must've been
quite a strain for her.

380
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,568
I mean, she didn't have to go to work
or anything like that.

381
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,778
He left her a little money.

382
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,117
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

383
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,954
And he talked her into building this motel.

384
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,373
He could have talked her into anything.

385
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:40,710
And when he died, too,
it was just too great a shock for her.

386
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,047
And the way he died. . .

387
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,092
(CHUCKLES)

388
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:50,721
I guess it's nothing to talk
about while you're eating.

389
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:55,266
Anyway, it was just too great a loss for her.
She had nothing left.

390
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,436
Except you.

391
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,983
Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.

392
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,818
Why don't you go away?

393
00:40:07,362 --> 00:40:09,655
To a private island, like you?

No, not like me.

396
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,833
I couldn't do that. Who'd look after her?

397
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:23,461
She'd be alone up there.

398
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,255
Her fire would go out.

399
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,510
It'd be cold and damp like a grave.

400
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,846
If you love someone,

401
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,182
you don't do that to them,
even if you hate them.

402
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,728
You understand, I don't hate her.

403
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,648
I hate what she's become.

404
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,443
I hate the illness.

405
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,572
Wouldn't it be better if you put her

406
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:53,867
someplace. . .

407
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,248

"someplace," don't they?

409

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to sound uncaring.

of one of those places?

417

as one of those stuffed birds.

418
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,248
I am sorry.

419
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:46,043
I only felt. . . It seems she's hurting you.

-People always mean well.

01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:26,409
Why, I know you don't, because if you did,
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

509
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,702
What's your interest in this?

510
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,746
Well, $40,000.

511
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,418
-$40,000?
-That's right.

512
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,548
Well, one of you'd better tell me
what's going on, and tell me fast.

513
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,842
-I can take just so much of this. . .
-Now, take it easy, friend.

514
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:48,514
Take it easy.
It's just that your girlfriend stole $40,000.

515
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:50,974
What are you talking about? What is this?

516
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:55,228
She was supposed to bank it on Friday
for her boss and she didn't.

517
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,940
-And no one has seen her since.
-Someone has seen her.

518
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:02,068
Someone always sees a girl with $40,000.

519
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,905
Sam, they don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

520
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:07,949
-Sam, if she's here. . .
-She isn't. She isn't.

521
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,702
Miss Crane, can I ask you a question?

522
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,538
Did you come up here on just a hunch
and nothing more?

523
01:03:12,621 --> 01:03:14,831
Not even a hunch. Just hope.

524
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:18,501
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

525
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:21,380
I don't care if you believe me or not.

526
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:24,800
All I want to do is see Marion
before she gets in this too deeply.

527
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:28,344
Did you check in Phoenix? Hospitals?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.

528
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:30,306
No, she was seen leaving town
in her own car,

529
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,682
by her employer, I might add.

530
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:35,393
I can't believe it. Can you?

531
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,606
Well, you know,
we're always quickest to doubt people

532
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,150
who have a reputation for being honest.

533
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,527
I think she's here, Miss Crane.

534
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,780
Where there's a boyfriend. . .

535
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:49,074
Well, she's not back there
with the nuts and bolts,

536
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,911
but she's here, in this town somewhere.

537
01:03:52,369 --> 01:03:54,871
I'll find her. I'll be seeing you.

538
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:06,592
(INAUDIBLE)

539
01:04:13,974 --> 01:04:15,351
(CAR APPROACHING)

540
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:33,952
-Evening.
-Evening.

541
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,788
I almost drove right past.

542
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:38,916
I'm always forgetting to turn the sign on,
but we do have a vacancy.

543
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,001
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. Candy?

544
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,628
No, thanks.

545
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,757
Last two days, I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon,

546
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:50,385
but, you know, this is the first place
that looks like it's hiding from the world.

547
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:53,347
Well, I'll tell you the truth.
I didn't really forget to turn the sign on.

548
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,684
Just doesn't seem
like any use any more, you know.

549
01:04:57,686 --> 01:05:00,563
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

550
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:01,896
Well, wanna come in and register?

551
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,440
No, no, sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.

552
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:06,735
-I just wanna ask a few questions.
-No, that's no trouble. Today's linen day.

553
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,405
I always change the beds here once a week
whether they've been used or not.

554
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,907
Hate the smell of dampness, don't you?
It's such a. . .

555
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:14,742
I don't know, creepy smell. Come on.

556
01:05:16,036 --> 01:05:17,996
You out to buy a motel?

557
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:20,833
No.

558
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:22,835
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen so many

559
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:26,088
in the past couple of days,
I thought maybe you. . .

560
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,798
What. . . What was it you wanted to ask?

561
01:05:28,882 --> 01:05:31,677
Well, you see,
I'm looking for a missing person.

562
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,014
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

563
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,931
I've been trying to trace a girl

564
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:40,768
that's been missing for, oh,
about a week now from Phoenix.

565
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:43,396
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.

566
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,608
She's not in any trouble.

567
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,860
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

568
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,070
-I'm not the police.
-Oh, yeah.

569
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,989
We have reason to believe
that she came along this way.

570
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,534
May have stopped in the area.
Did she stop here?

571
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:58,202
Well, no one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

572
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:00,623
Would you mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself?

573
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:01,956
Commit myself?

574
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:05,918
-You sure talk like a policeman.
-Look at the picture, please.

575
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:07,630
Mmm-mmm.

576
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,422
-Sure?
-Yeah.

577
01:06:10,342 --> 01:06:12,635
Well, she may have used an alias.

578
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,177
Marion Crane's her real name,

579
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:17,514
but she could've registered
under a different one.

580
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:22,101
Well, I tell you, I don't even much bother
with guests registering any more.

581
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:24,855
You know, one by one,
you drop the formalities.

582
01:06:24,938 --> 01:06:27,315
I shouldn't even bother
changing the sheets,

583
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,652
but old habits die hard.

584
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:31,527
Which reminds me. . .

585
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:35,407
-What's that?
-It's the light. The sign.

586
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:38,661
We had a couple last week,
said if the thing hadn't been on,

587
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:40,829
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted. . .

588
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:43,206
Well, you see, that's exactly my point.

589
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,166
You said that nobody'd been here
for a couple weeks,

590
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,045
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

591
01:06:48,128 --> 01:06:49,128
Yeah.

592
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,507
Well, as you say, old habits die hard.

593
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:54,510
It's possible, this girl could've registered
under another name.

594
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,219
Do you mind if I look at your book?

595
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,262
-No.
-Thank you.

596
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,518
All right.

597
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,853
I'll get the date somewhere.

598
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:07,940
See, there's nobody.

599
01:07:08,023 --> 01:07:11,777
Let's see now, I have a sample of her
handwriting here.

600
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,905
Oh, yes.

601
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:17,240
Here we are.

602
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:20,536
Marie Samuels. That's an interesting alias.

603
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,996
-Is that her?
-Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

604
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:26,083
Marie, Marion.

605
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:28,835
Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.

606
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:29,920
Mmm-hmm.

607
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,840
Was she in disguise, by any chance?

608
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,760
-Wanna check the picture again?
-Look, I wasn't lying to you, Mr. . .

609
01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:39,887
Oh, I know that. I know you wouldn't lie.

610
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,849
You know, it's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

611
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,684
Oh, I know, I know.

612
01:07:44,476 --> 01:07:46,061
Oh, yeah.

613
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:48,313
Well, it was raining

614
01:07:49,606 --> 01:07:51,358
and her hair was all wet.

615
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:54,152
I tell you, it's not really
a very good picture of her either.

616
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,862
No, I guess not.

617
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,447
Tell me all about her.

618
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,824
Well,

619
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:03,536
she arrived rather late one night,
and she went straight to sleep

620
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,248
and left early the next morning.

621
01:08:06,331 --> 01:08:09,460
-How early?
-Oh, very early.

622
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:12,755
Mmm-hmm. Which morning was that?

623
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,088
The. . .

624
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,511
-The next morning. Sunday.
-I see.

625
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,514
-Did anyone meet her here?
-No.

626
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,516
-Did she arrive with anyone?
-No.

627
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:28,103
-Did she make any phone calls or. . .
-No.

628
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:29,520
Locally?

629
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,858
Did you spend the night with her?

630
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,359
No.

631
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:38,238
Well then, how would you know
that she didn't make any phone calls?

632
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:40,865
(STAMMERING)

633
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,911
Well, she was very tired and. . .

634
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:47,288
See, now I'm starting to remember.

635
01:08:47,372 --> 01:08:48,957
I'm making a mental picture of it in my mind.

636
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,917
You know, if you make a mental
picturisation of something. . .

637
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,628
That's right. That's right. Take your time.

638
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:56,047
She was. . . She was sitting back there. . .

639
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:59,051
No, no, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand

640
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,802
and she said she had to go to sleep early

641
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:05,890
because she had a long drive ahead of her.

642
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:08,476
-Back where?
-Back where she came from.

643
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,354
No, you said before that she was
sitting back there. . . Standing back there. . .

644
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,899
Yes, back in my parlour there.

645
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,109
She was very hungry
and I made her a sandwich

646
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:21,614
and then she said that she was tired
and she had to go right to bed.

647
01:09:21,698 --> 01:09:23,867
I see. How did she pay you?

648
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:25,284
-Cash? Cheque?
-Cash.

649
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:26,703
Cash, huh?

650
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:31,457
-And after she left, she didn't come back?
-Well, why should she?

651
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,542
Yeah.

(CLEARS THROAT)

653
01:09:37,172 --> 01:09:40,259
Well, Mr Arbogast, I guess that's about it.

654
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,595
I've got some work to do, if you don't mind.

655
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,680
Well, to tell you the truth, I do mind.

656
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:49,893
You see, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic,
and this ain't jelling.

657
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:53,063
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

658
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:56,984
Well, I don't know
what you could expect me to know.

659
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,527
People just come and go, you know.

01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:02,238
-That's right. She isn't still here, is she?
-No.

661
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:07,243
If I wanted to check the cabins,
all 1 2 of them,

662
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,578
I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

663
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:11,539
Listen, if you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

664
01:10:11,623 --> 01:10:14,208
-Okay?
-No, thanks.

665
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,645
Change your mind?

666
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:40,985
You know, I. . . I think I must have one
of those faces you just can't help believing.

667
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:42,863
-Is anyone at home?
-No.

668
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,239
Oh? There's somebody
sitting up in the window.

669
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,701
-No, no, there isn't.
-Sure, go ahead. Take a look.

01:10:47,784 --> 01:10:49,744
Oh, that must be my mother.

She's an invalid.

01:10:52,372 --> 01:10:54,373
It's practically like living alone.

673
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:55,958
Oh, I see.

674
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:01,590
Now, if this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

675
01:11:01,673 --> 01:11:04,009
-No.
-Not even if she paid you well?

676
01:11:04,092 --> 01:11:05,176
No.

677
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:10,932
Let's just say, just for the sake of argument,
that she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

678
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:12,893
You'd know that you were being used.

679
01:11:12,976 --> 01:11:14,269
You wouldn't be made a fool of, would you?

680
01:11:14,354 --> 01:11:15,938
-But I'm not a fool.
-Well, I. . .

681
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:19,065
And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

682
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:21,568
-Well, this is not a slur on your manhood.
-Let's put it this way.

683
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:25,529
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

684
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,532
Well, then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

685
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,284
No. As I told you, she's confined.

686
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,619
Yes, but just for a few minutes. That's all.

687
01:11:31,703 --> 01:11:33,788
There might be some hint
that you missed out on.

688

are usually pretty sharp.

-Just for a moment. I wouldn't disturb her.

690
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,881
-I think I've talked to you all I want to.
-Yes, but just for. . .

691
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:45,257
I think it'd be much better if you left now.
Thanks.

692
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,095
Well, all right.

693
01:11:48,845 --> 01:11:52,140
You sure would save me a lot of leg work
if you'd let me talk to her.

694
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:53,641
-Would I need a warrant for that, too?
-Sure.

Uh-huh.

01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,895

Okay. Let me talk to her, please.

Hello, Lila.

702
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:03,962
Lila, listen. Marion was up here.

703
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:07,673
Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

704

It's right out here on the old highway.

I even know what cabin she was in.
It was number one.

706
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:17,893
Well, this young fella that runs the place
said that she just spent the night,

707
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:20,479
left the next day and that was it.

708
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:24,649
No, not exactly.

709
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:30,238
Well, I did question him, believe me,
but I think I got all there was to get.

710
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:33,492
I'll just have to pick up the pieces from here.

711
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,537
Well, I tell you,
I don't feel entirely satisfied. . .

712
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:39,956
See, this boy had a sick old mother.

713
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:42,958
I think she saw Marion and talked to her.

714
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:46,296
No. No, unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

715
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:50,509
Well, I was,
but I think I'll go back to the motel first.

716
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:55,055
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

if he had anything at all?

Well, we got a call from this detective

765
01:20:40,668 --> 01:20:43,046
saying that he'd traced her to that motel
out on the old highway.

766
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,088
That must be the Bates Motel.

767
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:48,091
He traced her there and called us to say
he was going to question Mrs Bates.

768
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,761
Norman took a wife?

769

An old woman. His mother.

770
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,684
Well, anyway, that was early this evening.
We haven't seen or heard from him since.

771
01:20:56,769 --> 01:21:00,270
Now, your sister's missing how long?

772
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:03,524
Well, she left Phoenix a week ago yesterday,
without a trace.

How'd you and this detective
come to trace her to Fairvale?

-Left Phoenix under her own steam?
-Yes.

776
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,452
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

-SAM: That's right.
-From what?

778
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,335
-She stole some money.
-SHERIFF: A lot?

779
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,712
$40,000.

And the police haven't been able to. . .

781
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:31,802
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

782
01:21:31,886 --> 01:21:34,346
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

783
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:38,350
That explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.

784
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,895
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

785
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:44,774
Well, he said that Marion was there
for one night and then she left.

786
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,568
With the $40,000?

787
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:49,404
Well, he didn't say anything
about the money.

788
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,905
It isn't important what
he said on the phone, is it?

789
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,574
He was supposed to come back here
and talk to us

790
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:55,743
after he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

791
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,037
That's what I want you
to do something about.

792
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,622
Like what?

793
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:02,125
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

794
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:05,920
It's just that I'm sure there's something
wrong out there and I have to know what.

795
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:09,465
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, miss, but not the same thing.

796
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,719
I think what's wrong is
your private detective.

797
01:22:12,802 --> 01:22:16,764
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was going,

798
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,932
probably from Norman Bates,

799
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:23,229
and called you to keep you still
while he took off after her and the money.

800
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:27,149
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

801
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:29,610
Why don't you call Norman
and let him say just what happened?

803
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:33,363
Well, he was out
when I was there just a while ago.

804
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:35,490
If he's back,
he probably isn't even in bed yet.

He wasn't out when you were there,

806
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:40,537
he just wasn't answering the door
in the dead of night, like some people do.

This fellow lives like a hermit.

808
01:22:42,957 --> 01:22:46,085
You must remember that bad business
out there about 1 0 years ago.

809
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,795
Please. Call.

connect him with the Bates Motel.

Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight. . .

815
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,036
Well, this one wouldn't be
a customer, anyway.

819
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:34,132
No, that's okay, Norman.

(HANGS UP PHONE)

821
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:39,846
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl,

822
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:42,809
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

823
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,813
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

824
01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:49,148
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back

825
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:53,110
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

826
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:54,319
Yes.

827
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:57,739

been dead and buried

she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

831
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,753
It's the only case of murder and suicide
on Fairvale ledgers.

832
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:16,300
Mrs Bates poisoned this guy
she was involved with

833
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,636
when she found out he was married.

834
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,805
Then took a helping

01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,984
You mean that old woman I saw sitting in
the window out there wasn't Bates' mother?

839
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:38,113
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

840
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:40,658
Yes! In the house behind the motel !

841
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:43,034
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

842
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:45,872
You want to tell me
you saw Norman Bates' mother?

843
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:49,167
But it had to be
because Arbogast said so, too!

844
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:52,920
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

845
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:55,881
Well, if the woman up there is Mrs Bates,

in Green Lawn Cemetery?

-Went out before service.

she used a fake name.

what would you need to get out?

01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:19,806

How could we prove that. . .

Well, if he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year. . .

942
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:31,359
There must be some proof that exists now,

943
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:34,988
something that proves he got that money
away from Marion somehow.

944
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:39,243
-What makes you sound so certain?
-Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

945
01:31:39,743 --> 01:31:43,247
Or he felt sorry for me and he was
beginning to feel the same way about you.

946

I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

947
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,458
He wouldn't have gone anywhere

948
01:31:47,543 --> 01:31:50,253
or done anything without telling us,
unless he was stopped.

949
01:31:50,337 --> 01:31:54,175
And he was stopped.
So he must have found out something.

-It'd be too wild a coincidence. . .
-Bates never denied she was here.

959
01:33:43,158 --> 01:33:45,118
Well, doesn't that prove that he found out
about the money?

960
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:46,912
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?

No.

she told Arbogast something.

-Well, let's find him.

One of us can keep him occupied
while the other gets to the old woman.

967

if he doesn't want to be held.

-I don't like you going into that house alone.
-I can handle a sick old woman.

All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

Yes, of course.

974
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:27,869

-Oh, it's fine.

-Mmm-hmm.

extreme reaction, don't you?

You look frightened.
Have I been saying something frightening?

1000
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:30,546
I don't know what you've been saying.

1001
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:34,091
I've been talking about your mother,
about your motel.

1002
01:39:34,176 --> 01:39:36,261
-How you gonna do it?
-Do what?

1003
01:39:36,345 --> 01:39:39,264
Buy a new one in a new town
where you won't have to hide your mother.

1004
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:42,100
Why don't you just get in your car
and drive away from here, okay?

1005
01:39:42,185 --> 01:39:44,144
Where will you get
the money to do that, Bates?

1006
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:46,145
Or do you already have it socked away?

1007
01:39:46,229 --> 01:39:49,065
-Shut up!
-A lot of it. $40,000.

1008
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:56,323
I bet your mother knows where
the money is and what you did to get it.

1009
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,408
I think she'll tell us.

1010
01:40:00,243 --> 01:40:03,747
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?

No.

1023
01:42:18,381 --> 01:42:23,677
I got the whole story, but not from Norman.
I got it from his mother.

1024
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:27,390
Norman Bates no longer exists.

1025
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:31,019
He only half-existed to begin with.

1026
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:34,021
And now the other half has taken over,

1027
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:37,609
probably for all time.

1028
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:41,529
Did he kill my sister?

1029
01:42:41,613 --> 01:42:44,658
Yes. And no.

1032
01:42:50,747 --> 01:42:53,625
A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork.

1033
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:56,043
He merely tries to explain it.

1034
01:42:56,628 --> 01:42:58,880
-But my sister is. . .
-FRED: Yes.

1035
01:43:01,716 --> 01:43:03,801
Yes, I'm sorry.

01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:11,225
If you drag that swamp somewhere
in the vicinity of the motel, you'll. . .

1038
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:17,858
Have you any unsolved missing
persons cases on your books?

1039
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:20,569
-Yes, two.
-Young girls?

1040
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:24,613
-Did he confess to. . .
-Like I said, the mother.

1041
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:30,871
Now, to understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the mother,

1042
01:43:31,454 --> 01:43:34,707
that is, from the mother half
of Norman's mind,

1043
01:43:35,292 --> 01:43:37,711
you have to go back 1 0 years

1044
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:41,547
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

1045
01:43:41,631 --> 01:43:46,511
Now, he was already dangerously disturbed,
had been ever since his father died.

1046
01:43:47,555 --> 01:43:51,181
His mother was a clinging,
demanding woman,

1047
01:43:52,685 --> 01:43:57,396
and for years the two of them lived
as if there was no one else in the world.

1048
01:43:57,814 --> 01:43:59,608
Then she met a man,

1049
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:03,944
and it seemed to Norman
that she threw him over for this man.

1050
01:44:04,697 --> 01:44:08,408
Now, that pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

1051
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:12,746
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all,

1052
01:44:14,206 --> 01:44:17,167
most unbearable to the son who commits it.

1053
01:44:18,168 --> 01:44:22,963
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

1054
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:27,801
He stole her corpse.

1055
01:44:30,347 --> 01:44:32,681
A weighted coffin was buried.

1056
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:36,019
He hid the body in the fruit cellar,

1057
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:39,355
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

1058
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:41,649
And that still wasn't enough.

1059
01:44:42,443 --> 01:44:46,070
She was there, but she was a corpse.

1060
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:51,408
So he began to think and speak for her,

1061
01:44:51,493 --> 01:44:54,037
give her half his life, so to speak.

1062
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:58,707
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

1063
01:44:59,793 --> 01:45:03,296
At other times,
the mother half took over completely.

1064
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:08,551
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only Mother,

1065
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:13,347
and because he was
so pathologically jealous of her,

1066
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:16,266
he assumed that she was as jealous of him.

1067
01:45:16,351 --> 01:45:20,896
Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman,

1068
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:24,650
the mother side of him would go wild.

1069
01:45:27,947 --> 01:45:29,989
When he met your sister,

1070
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:33,659
he was touched by her, aroused by her.

1071
01:45:33,743 --> 01:45:35,244
He wanted her.

1072
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:41,542
That set off the jealous mother,
and Mother killed the girl.

1073
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:46,797
After the murder,
Norman returned as if from a deep sleep,

1074
01:45:47,382 --> 01:45:51,301
and, like a dutiful son,
covered up all traces of the crime

1075
01:45:51,386 --> 01:45:54,014
he was convinced
his mother had committed !

1076
01:45:54,097 --> 01:45:56,432
Why was he dressed like that?

1077
01:45:56,891 --> 01:45:58,768
He's a transvestite.

1078
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:01,270
Not exactly.

1079
01:46:01,896 --> 01:46:05,315
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change

1080
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,860
or satisfaction is a transvestite.

1081
01:46:07,944 --> 01:46:12,448
But in Norman's case,
he was simply doing everything possible

1082
01:46:12,533 --> 01:46:16,036
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

1083
01:46:17,328 --> 01:46:19,872
And when reality came too close,

1084
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:23,501
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

1085
01:46:25,837 --> 01:46:28,965
he'd dress up,
even to a cheap wig he bought.

1086
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:33,177
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

1087
01:46:33,261 --> 01:46:35,471
He tried to be his mother.

1088
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:40,060
And now he is.

1089
01:46:41,979 --> 01:46:45,230
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the mother.

1090
01:46:45,315 --> 01:46:48,568
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities,

1091
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:51,820
there's always a conflict, a battle.

1092
01:46:52,782 --> 01:46:55,574
In Norman's case, the battle is over,

1093
01:46:56,409 --> 01:46:58,828
and the dominant personality has won.

1094
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:01,706
And the $40,000? Who got that?

1095
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:06,543
The swamp.
These were crimes of passion, not profit.

1096
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:12,509
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

1097
01:47:12,592 --> 01:47:14,551
-Oh, sure.
-All right.

1101
01:47:41,372 --> 01:47:45,207

that l would commit murder.

as l should have years ago.

He was always bad,

1104
01:47:52,048 --> 01:47:57,095
and in the end he intended to tell them
l killed those girls and that man,

1105
01:47:57,179 --> 01:48:00,890
as if l could do anything
except just sit and stare,

1106
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:03,393

and l won't.

1108
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:13,360
l'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.

1109
01:48:16,364 --> 01:48:19,617
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

l hope they are watching. They'll see.

1113
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:31,671
They'll see and they'll know,

1114
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:36,259
and they'll say,
"Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly."
