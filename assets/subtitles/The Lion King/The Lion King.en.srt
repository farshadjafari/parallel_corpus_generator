You see, I... Well, I shall never be king.

46
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:09,516
And you shall never see
the light of another day.

47
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,726
Adieu.

48
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,521
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to play with your food?

49
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,440
What do you want?

50
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,730
I'm here to announce

51
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:19,901
that King Mufasa's on his way,

52
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,029
so you'd better have a good excuse

53
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,572
for missing this morning's ceremony.

54
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,616
Oh, look, Zazu.
You've made me lose my lunch.

55
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,619
You'll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you.

56
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,372
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

57
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,917
I quiver with fear!

58
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,545
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.

59
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,921
Help!

60
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,215
- Scar?
- Mm-hmm?

61
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,467
Drop him.

62
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,803
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.

63
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,053
Why, if it isn't my big brother

64
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:56,146
descending from on high
to mingle with the commoners.

65
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,358
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

66
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,568
That was today?

67
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,987
I feel simply awful!

68
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,949
Must've slipped my mind.

69
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,244
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,

70
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,667
as the king's brother,
you should've been first in line!

71
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,319
Well, I was first in line,

72
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,563
until the little hairball was born.

73
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:22,417
That hairball is my son

74
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:24,383
and your future king.

75
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,135
I shall practise my curtsy!

76
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,805
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

77
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,223
Oh, no, Mufasa.

78
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,142
Perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

79
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,145
Is that a challenge?

80
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,147
Temper, temper.

81
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,983
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

82
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:43,985
Pity. Why not?

83
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,786
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

84
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:50,826
But when it comes to brute strength,

85
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end
of the gene pool.

86
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,794
There's one in every family, sire.

87
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,725
Two in mine, actually,

88
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:05,674
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions.

89
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,342
What am I going to do with him?

90
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,177
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

91
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:10,429
Zazu!

92
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,108
And just think,
whenever he gets dirty,

93
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:15,342
you could take him out and beat him.

94
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,057
Hmm.

95
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,638
Simba.

96
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,262
Dad! Dad!

97
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,581
Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up!

98
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,917
- Uhh!
- Sorry.

99
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,378
Dad! Dad!

100
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,340
Your son is awake.

101
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,781
Before sunrise, he's your son.

102
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:33,678
Dad! Come on, Dad.

103
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,001
You promised.

104
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,812
Okay, Okay.
I'm up, I'm up.

105
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,980
Yeah!

106
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,331
MUFASA: Look, Simba.

107
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,544
Everything the light
touches is our kingdom.

108
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,337
Wow.

109
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,827
A king's time as ruler

110
00:09:09,828 --> 00:09:12,342
rises and falls like the sun.

111
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,155
One day, Simba,

112
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:16,835
the sun will set on my time here

113
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:19,891
and will rise with you as the new king.

114
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,686
- And this'll all be mine?
- Everything.

115
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,647
Everything the light touches.

116
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,365
What about that shadowy place?

117
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:30,110
That's beyond our borders.

118
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,808
You must never go there, Simba.

119
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,822
But I thought a king
can do whatever he wants.

120
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,906
Oh, there's more to being king than...

121
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:37,381
getting your way all the time.

122
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:39,578
- There's more?
- Simba...

123
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,887
Everything you see

124
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:47,752
exists together
in a delicate balance.

125
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,755
As king, you need to
understand that balance

126
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,591
and respect all the creatures,

127
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,292
from the crawling ant

128
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,510
to the leaping antelope.

129
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,555
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

130
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,098
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

131
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,143
When we die, our bodies
become the grass,

132
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,895
and the antelope eat the grass.

133
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,315
And so we are all connected

134
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:11,234
in the great circle of life.

135
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,653
- Good morning, sire!
- Good morning, Zazu.

136
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,796
Checking in with the morning report.

137
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:16,740
Fire away.

138
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,630
Well! The buzz from the bees

139
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,410
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

140
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,578
Really?

141
00:10:22,893 --> 00:10:23,997
What are you doing, son?

142
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:25,582
Pouncing.

143
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,201
Let an old pro show you how it's done.

144
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,087
I told the elephants to forget it,
but they can't...

145
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,220
- Zazu, would you turn around?
- Yes, sire.

146
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:35,842
- The cheetahs are hard up, but...
- Stay low to the ground.

147
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,096
- Cheetahs never prosper...
- Yeah, okay.

148
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,429
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.

149
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,680
- What going on?
- A pouncing lesson.

150
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,016
Very good. Pouncing.

151
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,519
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...

152
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,550
This is so humiliating.

153
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:50,940
Try not to make a sound.

154
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,318
What are you telling him, Mufasa?

155
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,655
Mufasa? Simba?

156
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,701
That's very good.

157
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,320
- Zazu!
- Yes!

158
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:04,974
Sir! News from the underground.

159
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:06,373
Now, this time...

160
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,709
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!

161
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,378
Zazu, take Simba home.

162
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,629
Aw, dad, can't I come?

163
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,713
No, son.

164
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,311
Pah! I never get to go anywhere.

165
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:18,972
Oh, young master,

166
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:21,352
one day, you will be king.

167
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:22,488
Then you can chase

168
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:25,389
those slobbering, mangy,
stupid poachers

169
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,227
from dawn until dusk.

170
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,144
Hey, Uncle Scar!
Guess what?

171
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:39,823
I despise guessing games.

172
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,991
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.

173
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,327
Oh, goody!

174
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,162
My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,

175
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,249
and I'm gonna rule it all!

176
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,271
Yes. Well, forgive me
for not leaping for joy.

177
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:55,255
Bad back, you know.

178
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,424
Hey, Uncle Scar.

179
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,088
When I'm king,
what'll that make you?

180
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:02,178
A monkey's uncle.

181
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,076
You're so weird.

182
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:06,099
You have no idea.

183
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,826
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?

184
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:10,520
Everything.

185
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:14,190
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?

186
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,694
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

187
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,779
And he's absolutely right.

188
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,546
It's far too dangerous.

189
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:23,700
Only the bravest lions go there.

190
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,453
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?

191
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,038
I'm sorry, Simba,
I just can't tell you.

192
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,880
Why not?

193
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,203
Simba, Simba,

194
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:34,627
I'm only looking out for the
well-being of my favourite nephew.

195
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,547
Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew.

196
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,133
All the more reason
for me to be protective.

197
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,044
An elephant graveyard

198
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:44,471
is no place
for a young prince. Oops!

199
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,140
An elephant what? Whoa!

200
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,393
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

201
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,313
Well, I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,

202
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,399
you being so clever and all.

203
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,151
Just do me one favour.

204
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:02,822
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.

205
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,324
No problem.

206
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,075
There's a good lad.

207
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,912
You run along now and have fun.

208
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,497
And remember,

209
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,082
it's our little secret.

210
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,175
- Hey, Nala.
- Hi, Simba.

211
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,427
Come on. I just heard
about this great place.

212
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,013
Simba! I'm kind of
in the middle of a bath.

213
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,182
SARABI: And it's time for yours.

214
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,268
Mom!

215
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,271
Mom, you're messing up my mane!

216
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,108
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?

217
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,527
So, where are we going?

218
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,111
It better not be anyplace dumb.

219
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,155
No, it's really cool.

220
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,616
So, where is this really cool place?

221
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,117
Oh.

222
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,870
- Uh, around the water hole.
- The water hole?

223
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,789
What's so great about the water hole?

224
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,041
I'll show you when we get there.

225
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,292
Oh.

226
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,211
Uh, mom, can I go with Simba?

227
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,547
Hmm, what do you think, Sarabi?

228
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,673
Well...

229
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,132
BOTH: Please?

230
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,384
It's all right with me.

231
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,552
- Yeah!
- All right!

232
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,554
As long as Zazu goes with you.

233
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,222
No, not Zazu.

234
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,807
ZAZU: Step lively.

235
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,529
The sooner we get to the water hole,

236
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,894
the sooner we can leave.

237
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,855
So, where are we really going?

238
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,314
An elephant graveyard.

239
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,399
Wow!

240
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,984
Shh! Zazu.

241
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,820
Right. So, how are we
gonna ditch the dodo?

242
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,739
Oh, just look at you two.

243
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,909
Little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna.

244
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,245
Your parents will be thrilled,

245
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,956
what with your being betrothed and all.

246
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,722
Be-what?

247
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:37,584
Betrothed. Intended.

248
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,586
Affianced.

249
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,753
Meaning...

250
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,840
One day, you two are
going to be married.

251
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:44,924
- Yuck!
- Eww!

252
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,389
I can't marry her.
She's my friend.

253
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,512
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

254
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,726
Sorry to bust your bubble,

255
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:54,516
but you two turtle doves
have no choice.

256
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:56,769
It's a tradition going back generations.

257
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,397
When I'm king,
that'll be the first thing to go.

258
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,317
- Not so long as I'm around.
- Well, in that case, you're fired.

259
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,944
Nice try, but only the king can do that.

260
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,487
Well, he's the future king.

261
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,948
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.

262
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,491
Not yet, I don't.

263
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,186
And with an attitude like that,

264
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:15,914
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king, indeed.

265
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,624

00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:35,127
To be king.

305
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,262
ZAZU: I beg your pardon, madam, but

306
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,138
get off!

307
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,207
Simba?

308
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,142
Nala!

309
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,896
All right! It worked!

310
00:17:53,981 --> 00:17:56,857
- We lost him.
- I am a genius.

311
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:58,693
Hey, genius, it was my idea.

312
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,861
Yeah, but I pulled it off.

313
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:02,947
- With me!
- Oh, yeah?

314
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,203
- Pinned ya.
- Hey, let me up!

315
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,127
Pinned ya again.

316
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,850
This is it. We made it.

317
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:36,647
Whoa!

318
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,027
NALA: It's really creepy.

319
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,194
Yeah.

320
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,529
Isn't it great?

321
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,741
- We could get in big trouble.
- I know!

322
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,952
I wonder if its brains are still in there.

323
00:18:50,037 --> 00:18:51,912
There's only one way to know.

324
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,622
Come on, let's go check it out.

325
00:18:53,623 --> 00:18:57,878
Wrong! The only checking out you
will do will be to check out of here.

326
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:58,636
Oh, man!

327
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,422
We're way beyond the boundary
of the Pride Lands.

328
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,132
Look, banana beak is scared.

329
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:06,213
It's Mr. banana beak to you, fuzzy,

330
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:09,513
and right now we are all
in very real danger.

331
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:11,015
Danger? Ha!

332
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:13,184
I walk on the wild side.

333
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:15,519
I laugh in the face of danger.

334
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:17,021
Ha ha ha ha!

335
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:27,615
Well, well, well, Banzai,
what have we got here?

336
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,617
I don't know, Shenzi.

337
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,036
What do you think, Ed?

338
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:36,082
Just what I was thinking.

339
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,167
A trio of trespassers!

340
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,586
And quite by accident,
let me assure you.

341
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:42,380
A simple navigational error.

342
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:44,423
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

343
00:19:44,508 --> 00:19:48,511
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.

344
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:50,888
I, madam, am the king's major-domo.

345
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,737
And that would make you...

346
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:54,088
The future king.

347
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:57,645
Do you know what we do to kings
who step out of their kingdom?

348
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:00,439
Huh! You can't do anything to me.

349
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:02,780
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.

350
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:07,071
But Zazu, you told me they're nothing but
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.

351
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:09,050
Ix-nay on the upid-stay.

352
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:11,909
- Who are you callin' upid-stay?
- My, my, my. Oh, look at the sun!

353
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:14,086
- It's time to go!
- What's the hurry?

354
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,080
We'd love you to
stick around for dinner.

355
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:19,938
Yeah, we could have
whatever's lion around!

356
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:21,585
Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one!

357
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,997
Make mine a cub sandwich!
Whaddaya think?

358
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,968
What, Ed? What is it?

359
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:30,886
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

360
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:32,054
No, why?

361
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,306
'Cause there it goes!

362
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:43,232
- Did we lose 'em?
- I think so.

363
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:44,733
Where's Zazu?

364
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,695
The little major-domo bird

365
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:49,071
hippety-hopped all the way
to the birdie-boiler.

366
00:20:49,531 --> 00:20:52,199
Oh, no! Not the birdie-boiler!

367
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:54,243
Aaaah!

368
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:58,831
Hey, why don't you pick
on somebody your own size?

369
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,333
- Like you?
- Oops.

370
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:05,504
Boo!

371
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:19,518
NALA: Simba!

372
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:41,040
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

373
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:46,879
That was it?

374
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:49,256
Do it again. Come on.

375
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,034
- Oh, please, please!
- Uncle, uncle!

376
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:03,729
Silence!

377
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:07,024
- We're gonna shut up right now!
- Calm down. We're really sorry.

378
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:10,236
If you ever come near my son again...

379
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:11,987
Oh, this is... This is your son?

380
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:14,573
- Oh, your son.
- Did you know that?

381
00:22:14,658 --> 00:22:17,076
No. Me? I didn't know...
No, did you?

382
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,078
- No, of course not.
- No.

383
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:20,246
Ed?

384
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,917
Toodles.

385
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:34,727
- Dad, I...
- You deliberately disobeyed me.

386
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:39,181
- Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
- Let's go home.

387
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:44,812
I thought you were very brave.

388
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:03,038
MUFASA: Zazu.

389
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,562
- Yes, sire?
- Take Nala home.

390
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:10,671
I've got to teach my son a lesson.

391
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:16,802
Come, Nala.

392
00:23:16,886 --> 00:23:18,970
Simba,

393
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:20,306
good luck.

394
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:27,980
Simba!

395
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,509
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.

396
00:23:57,594 --> 00:24:00,012
- I know.
- You could've been killed.

397
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:01,995
You deliberately disobeyed me,

398
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:05,893
and what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

399
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:08,562
I was just trying to be brave, like you.

400
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:12,024
I'm only brave when I have to be.

401
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:15,736
Simba, being brave

402
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,155
doesn't mean you go
looking for trouble.

403
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:20,282
But you're not scared of anything.

404
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:22,576
I was today.

405
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,828
- You were?
- Yes.

406
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:27,039
I thought I might lose you.

407
00:24:27,123 --> 00:24:31,126
I guess even kings get scared, huh?

408
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:32,378
Mm-hmm.

409
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:34,713
- But you know what?
- What?

410
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:37,341
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

411
00:24:38,968 --> 00:24:42,096
'Cause nobody messes with your dad.

412
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,640
- Come here, you.
- Oh, no! No!

413
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:47,059
Aagh! Uhh!

414
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:49,353
SIMBA: Come here!

415
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,897
Gotcha!

416
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:58,696
- Dad?
- Hmm?

417
00:24:58,822 --> 00:25:00,563
We're pals, right?

418
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:01,657
Right.

419
00:25:01,658 --> 00:25:04,368
And we'll always be together, right?

420
00:25:05,662 --> 00:25:07,315
Simba,

421
00:25:07,316 --> 00:25:11,375
let me tell you something
that my father told me.

422
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:13,752
Look at the stars.

423
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:16,051
The great kings of the past

424
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:18,549
look down on us from those stars.

425
00:25:18,913 --> 00:25:20,926
- Really?
- Yes.

426
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,387
So whenever you feel alone,

427
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:28,142
just remember that those kings
will always be there to guide you.

428
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:31,478
And so will I.

429
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,890
BANZAI: Man, that lousy Mufasa.

430
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:41,864
I won't be able to sit for a week.

431
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,702
It's not funny, Ed.

432
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,708
Hey, shut up!

433
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:57,171
Will you knock it off?

434
00:25:58,381 --> 00:25:59,582
Well, he started it.

435
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:01,383
SHENZI: Look at you guys.

436
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:04,052
No wonder we're dangling
at the bottom of the food chain.

437
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:05,286
Man, I hate dangling.

438
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:08,154
Yeah? If it weren't for those lions,

439
00:26:08,155 --> 00:26:09,558
we'd be runnin' the joint.

440
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:11,059
Man, I hate lions.

441
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:12,811
- So pushy.
- And hairy.

442
00:26:12,896 --> 00:26:14,980
- And stinky.
- And, man, are they...

443
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:17,065
BOTH: Ugly!

444
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:22,237
Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad.

445
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,612
- Oh.
- Oh, Scar. It's just you.

446
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:27,326
We were afraid it was
somebody important.

447
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,827
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.

448
00:26:28,912 --> 00:26:30,454
- SHENZI: Yeah.
- I see.

449
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:32,831
- Now that's power!
- Tell me about it.

450
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:34,666
I just hear that name and I shudder.

451
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:37,336
- Mufasa!
- Ooh! Do it again.

452
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,754
- Mufasa!
- Ooooh!

453
00:26:39,128 --> 00:26:41,423
Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa!

454
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,300
SHENZI: Ooh, it tingles me.

455
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:46,261
I'm surrounded by idiots.

456
00:26:46,346 --> 00:26:48,241
Now, you, Scar,
I mean, you're one of us.

457
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:49,431
I mean, you're our pal.

458
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:50,516
Charmed.

459
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:52,053
Oh, I like that.

460
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:55,094
He's not king,
but he's still so proper.

461
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:57,002
Yeah. Hey, did you
bring us anything to eat,

462
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:59,107
Scar, old buddy, old pal?
Huh? Did ya, did ya, did ya?

463
00:26:59,108 --> 00:27:01,443
I don't think you really deserve this.

464
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:04,613
I practically gift-wrapped
those cubs for you,

465
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:08,116
and you couldn't even dispose of them.

466
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:11,949
Well, you know,

467
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,873
it wasn't exactly
like they was alone, Scar.

468
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:17,125
Yeah. What were we supposed to do?

469
00:27:17,627 --> 00:27:19,127
Kill Mufasa?

470
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,798

00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,278
Come on, Uncle Scar.

529
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,837
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

530
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:51,256
This is just for you and your daddy.

531
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:56,011
You know, a sort of father-son thing.

532
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:58,889
Well, I'd better go get him.

533
00:30:59,015 --> 00:31:00,807
- I'll go with you.
- No.

534
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:06,021
No. Just stay on this rock.

535
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:08,106
You wouldn't want to end up
in another mess

536
00:31:08,232 --> 00:31:09,900
like you did with the hyenas.

537
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,368
You know about that?

538
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,904
Simba, everybody knows about that.

539
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:16,573
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

540
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:20,368
Lucky daddy was there
to save you, eh?

541
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:23,163
Oh, and just between us,

542
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:26,625
you might want to work on
that little roar of yours, hmm?

543
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,627
Oh. Okay.

544
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:34,925
Hey, Uncle Scar,
will I like this surprise?

545
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:39,004
Simba, it's to die for.

546
00:32:00,576 --> 00:32:01,993
Shut up.

547
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,368
I can't help it.
I'm so hungry.

548
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:05,497
I got to have a wildebeest.

549
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:06,998
Stay put.

550
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,539
Can't I just pick off
one of the little sick ones?

551
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,338
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.

552
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:18,969
There he is. Let's go.

553
00:32:19,428 --> 00:32:22,347
"Little roar." Puh!

554
00:32:24,684 --> 00:32:25,809
Rarr!

555
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,020
Rrrarr!

556
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,193
Rarr!

557
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,660
Oh, look, sire, the herd is on the move.

558
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:28,079
- Odd.
- Mufasa, quick.

559
00:33:28,164 --> 00:33:30,081
Stampede in the gorge.

560
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,629
- Simba's down there!
- Simba?

561
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,651
Zazu, help me!

562
00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:58,800
Your father is on the way! Hold on!

563
00:33:58,801 --> 00:33:59,736
Hurry!

564
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:05,867
There! There on that tree!

565
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,285
Hold on, Simba!

566
00:34:08,704 --> 00:34:10,205
Dad!

567
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,294
ZAZU: Oh, Scar, this is awful!

568
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:18,546
What'll we do? What'll we do?

569
00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:21,299
I'll go back for help,
that's what I'll do.

570
00:34:57,253 --> 00:34:58,336
Dad!

571
00:35:21,193 --> 00:35:22,861
MUFASA: Scar!

572
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:26,531
- SCAR: Brother.
- Brother, help me!

573
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,043
Long live the king.

574
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:46,217
No!

575
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:00,398
Dad!

576
00:36:12,745 --> 00:36:52,784
Dad?

577
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:56,496
Dad, come on.

578
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:59,457
You got to get up.

579
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,543
Dad?

580
00:37:01,627 --> 00:37:03,586
We got to go home.

581
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,266
Help!

582
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:21,271
Somebody!

583
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:23,148
Anybody.

584
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,025
Help.

585
00:37:57,057 --> 00:38:00,727
Simba. What have you done?

586
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:04,981
There were wildebeests,
and he tried to save me.

587
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,234
It was an accident.
I didn't mean for it to happen.

588
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,530
Of course.
Of course you didn't.

589
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:18,077
No one ever means for
these things to happen.

590
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:20,246
But the king is dead.

591
00:38:21,874 --> 00:38:24,876
And if it weren't for you,
he'd still be alive.

592
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:32,217
Oh, what will your mother think?

593
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:34,761
What am I going to do?

594
00:38:34,787 --> 00:38:36,221
Run away, Simba.

595
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:42,602
Run. Run away and never return.

596
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,735
Kill him.

597
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:29,899
Whoa!

598
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:37,740
Yow!

599
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:40,410
Aah! Ohh! Yeow!

600
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:45,790
Hey, there he goes.
There he goes.

601
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:47,500
So go get him.

602
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:49,419
There ain't no way
I'm going in there.

603
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:51,453
What, you want me to come out
looking like you,

604
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:53,423
cactus butt?

605
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:55,800
But we got to finish the job.

606
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,928
Well, he's as good as
dead out there anyway.

607
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:01,806
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.

608
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:03,780
Yeah! You hear that?

609
00:40:03,781 --> 00:40:07,478
If you ever come back, we'll kill you!

610
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:20,043
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.

611
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:24,254
But to lose Simba,
who had barely begun to live...

612
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:30,251
For me, it is a deep, personal loss.

613
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:34,297
So it is with a heavy heart
that I assume the throne.

614
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:38,635
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy
we shall rise

615
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:41,679
to greet the dawning of a new era

616
00:40:41,805 --> 00:40:45,558
in which lion and hyena come together

617
00:40:45,684 --> 00:40:49,979
in a great and glorious future.

618
00:41:32,564 --> 00:41:34,565
Yaaaah!

619
00:41:37,236 --> 00:41:39,404
Get out! Get out!
Get out of here!

620
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,864
I love this! Bowling for buzzards.

621
00:41:42,074 --> 00:41:45,535
Hee hee hee!
Gets 'em every time.

622
00:41:45,744 --> 00:41:49,622
Uh-oh.
Hey, Timon, you better come look.

623
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:51,749
I think it's still alive.

624
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:53,126
Eeeuw.

625
00:41:53,419 --> 00:41:56,587
All righty, what have we got here?

626
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,805
Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it!

627
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:09,225
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.

628
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:10,601
Look at him.

629
00:42:10,602 --> 00:42:13,938
He's so cute and all alone.

630
00:42:14,273 --> 00:42:16,441
- Can we keep him?
- Pumbaa, are you nuts?

631
00:42:16,525 --> 00:42:18,211
You're talking about a lion.

632
00:42:18,212 --> 00:42:19,777
Lions eat guys like us.

633
00:42:19,862 --> 00:42:22,280
- But he's so little.
- He's going to get bigger.

634
00:42:22,448 --> 00:42:23,494
Maybe he'll be on our side.

635
00:42:24,616 --> 00:42:27,702
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard. Maybe he'll...

636
00:42:27,786 --> 00:42:29,448
Hey, I've got it.

637
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:31,038
What if he's on our side?

638
00:42:31,123 --> 00:42:34,459
You know, having a lion around
might not be such a bad idea.

639
00:42:34,543 --> 00:42:35,626
So we're keeping him?

640
00:42:35,711 --> 00:42:37,962
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?

641
00:42:38,046 --> 00:42:39,630
- Uh...
- My point exactly.

642
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:40,896
Jeez, I'm fried.

643
00:42:40,897 --> 00:42:43,050
Let's get out of here
and find some shade.

644
00:42:51,643 --> 00:42:53,811
- You okay, kid?
- I guess so.

645
00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:55,313
You nearly died.

646
00:42:55,314 --> 00:42:56,447
I saved you.

647
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,904
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.

648
00:42:59,364 --> 00:43:01,068
Thanks for your help.

649
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:03,488
Hey, where you going?

650
00:43:03,655 --> 00:43:05,823
Nowhere.

651
00:43:05,908 --> 00:43:07,241
Gee, he looks blue.

652
00:43:07,326 --> 00:43:09,151
I'd say brownish gold.

653
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:11,421
No, no, no.
I mean he's depressed.

654
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,769
- Kid, what's eating you?
- Nothing.

655
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:17,502
He's at the top of the food chain.

656
00:43:19,922 --> 00:43:21,339
The food chain!

657
00:43:23,258 --> 00:43:24,342
Ahem.

658
00:43:25,511 --> 00:43:26,928
So, where you from?

659
00:43:27,012 --> 00:43:29,263
Who cares? I can't go back.

660
00:43:29,264 --> 00:43:30,947
Ah, you're an outcast.

661
00:43:30,948 --> 00:43:32,517
That's great. So are we.

662
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,693
What'd you do, kid?

663
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,102
Something terrible.

664
00:43:35,103 --> 00:43:36,561
But I don't want to talk about it.

665
00:43:36,562 --> 00:43:38,105
Good. We don't want to hear about it.

666
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,358
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?

667
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:43,110
Not unless you can change the past.

668
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:44,783
You know, kid, in times like this,

669
00:43:44,784 --> 00:43:46,447
my buddy Timon here says,

670
00:43:46,532 --> 00:43:49,359
"You got to put your
behind in your past."

671
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,701
No, no, no.

672
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,119
- I mean...
- Amateur.

673
00:43:52,204 --> 00:43:54,372
Lie down before you hurt yourself.

674
00:43:54,873 --> 00:43:57,625
It's,
"You got to put your past behind you."

675
00:43:57,709 --> 00:43:59,645
Look, kid, bad things happen,

676
00:43:59,646 --> 00:44:01,712
and you can't do anything
about it, right?

677
00:44:01,797 --> 00:44:02,797
- Right.
- Wrong!

678
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:05,633
When the world turns its back on you,

679
00:44:05,634 --> 00:44:08,302
you turn your back on the world.

680
00:44:08,387 --> 00:44:10,304
Well, that's not what I was taught.

681
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:12,557
Then maybe you need a new lesson.

682
00:44:12,724 --> 00:44:14,976
Repeat after me. Ahem.

683
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,894
- Hakuna matata.
- What?

684
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,897
Hakuna matata.

685
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:21,232
It means "no worries".

686
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:24,235
<i>♪ Hakuna matata. ♪</i>

687
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:27,488

Hakuna matata?

695
00:44:49,428 --> 00:44:50,752
Yeah. It's our motto.

696
00:44:50,753 --> 00:44:52,013
What's a motto?

697
00:44:52,097 --> 00:44:54,432
Nothin'. What's-a-motto with you?

698
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:59,620
You know, kid, these two words
will solve all your problems.

699
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:01,852
That's right.
Take Pumbaa, for example.

700
00:45:01,853 --> 00:45:02,773
Why...

701
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,610

- Thought of changing my name.
- Oh, what's in a name?

711
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,806
And I got downhearted.

You live here?

726
00:46:11,314 --> 00:46:12,776
We live wherever we want.

727
00:46:12,777 --> 00:46:15,137
Yep. Home is where your rump rests.

728
00:46:15,263 --> 00:46:16,792
It's beautiful.

729
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,229
I'm starved.

730
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,519
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole zebra.

Ah. We're fresh out of zebra.

- Nope.

734
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:31,028
Listen, kid, if you live with us,
you have to eat like us.

735
00:46:31,113 --> 00:46:33,656
Hey, this looks like a good spot
to rustle up some grub.

736

00:46:38,203 --> 00:46:40,162
Eugh! Gross.

739
00:46:40,372 --> 00:46:42,707
Mmm. Tastes like chicken.

740
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:46,544
Slimy yet satisfying.

741
00:46:46,628 --> 00:46:49,296
These are rare delicacies. Mmm.

742
00:46:50,132 --> 00:46:53,217
Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch.

this is the great life,

- Nothing.
- You know the law.

in my presence.

I... I only mentioned it
to illustrate the differences

781
00:49:19,197 --> 00:49:21,847
in your royal managerial approaches.

782
00:49:21,848 --> 00:49:22,848

00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:24,952
Oh, what is it this time?

784
00:49:25,036 --> 00:49:26,377

00:49:26,378 --> 00:49:27,499
I'll handle this.

786
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,957
Scar, there's no food, no water.

787
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:31,850
Yeah. It's dinner time

788
00:49:31,851 --> 00:49:33,878
and we ain't got no stinking entrées.

789
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:38,094
It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting.

790
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:39,375
Yeah, but they won't go hunt.

791
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,531
Oh...

792
00:49:40,532 --> 00:49:41,575
Eat Zazu.

793
00:49:41,576 --> 00:49:43,840
Oh, you wouldn't want me.

794
00:49:43,841 --> 00:49:46,473
I'd be so tough and gamey and...

795
00:49:46,558 --> 00:49:49,977
Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous.
All you need is a little garlic.

796
00:49:50,061 --> 00:49:52,146
I thought things
were bad under Mufasa.

797
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,732
- What did you say?
- I said Muf...

798
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,400
I said qué pasa?

799
00:49:56,568 --> 00:49:58,903
Good. Now get out.

800
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:02,489
But we're still hungry.

801
00:50:02,574 --> 00:50:04,575
Out!

802
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:14,501
- Whoa! Nice one, Simba.
- Thanks.

803
00:50:14,586 --> 00:50:17,504
- Man, I'm stuffed.
- Me, too.

804
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:19,840
I ate like a pig.

805
00:50:19,925 --> 00:50:22,009
Pumbaa, you are a pig.

806
00:50:22,093 --> 00:50:24,094
Oh. Right.

807
00:50:35,106 --> 00:50:37,858
- Timon?
- Yeah?

808
00:50:37,943 --> 00:50:42,029
Ever wonder what those
sparkling dots are up there?

809
00:50:42,113 --> 00:50:45,366
Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know.

810
00:50:45,367 --> 00:50:48,202
Oh? What are they?

811
00:50:48,286 --> 00:50:50,037
They're fireflies.

812
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:54,541
Fireflies that got stuck
up in that big bluish-black thing.

813
00:50:54,626 --> 00:50:56,627
Oh, gee.

814
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,964
I always thought they were balls of gas

815
00:50:59,965 --> 00:51:03,467
burning billions of miles away.

816
00:51:04,135 --> 00:51:07,221
Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.

817
00:51:07,305 --> 00:51:09,306
Simba, what do you think?

818
00:51:09,724 --> 00:51:11,392
Well, I don't know.

819
00:51:11,476 --> 00:51:13,477
Oh, come on.
Give, give, give, give.

820
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,740
Come on. We told you ours.

821
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:18,649
- Please?
- Well...

822
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,818
Somebody once told me

823
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:23,757
that the great kings of the past
are up there

824
00:51:23,758 --> 00:51:25,406
watching over us.

825
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:26,573
Really?

826
00:51:26,658 --> 00:51:30,035
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys
are watching us?

827
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,537
Pfff!

828
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,105
Who told you something like that?

829
00:51:37,106 --> 00:51:38,252
Yeah, yeah.

830
00:51:38,336 --> 00:51:43,007
- What mook made that up?
- Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh?

831
00:51:43,091 --> 00:51:46,176
- Aw, you're killing me.
- Yeah.

832
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,731
Was it something I said?

833
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:26,592
Hmm.

00:52:49,157 --> 00:52:50,240

00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,015
You know her, she knows you.

884
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,936
But she wants to eat him,

885
00:56:03,937 --> 00:56:06,687
and everybody's okay with this?

886
00:56:06,813 --> 00:56:09,562
- Did I miss something?
- Relax, Timon.

887
00:56:09,563 --> 00:56:12,484
Wait till everyone finds out
you've been here all this time.

888
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:16,029
And your mother, what will she think?

889
00:56:16,114 --> 00:56:19,491
She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.

890
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,827
Of course they do.
Everyone thinks you're dead.

891
00:56:21,995 --> 00:56:23,078
They do?

892
00:56:23,162 --> 00:56:26,373
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.

893
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:29,735
He did? What else did he tell you?

894
00:56:29,736 --> 00:56:31,853
What else matters? You're alive.

895
00:56:31,854 --> 00:56:35,349
And that means, you're the king.

896
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,838
King?

897
00:56:37,485 --> 00:56:40,804
Lady, have you got
your lions crossed!

898
00:56:40,888 --> 00:56:42,055
King?

899
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:46,226
Your Majesty, I gravel at your feet.
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

900
00:56:46,352 --> 00:56:47,291
Stop it.

901
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:49,229
It's not gravel, it's grovel.

902
00:56:49,314 --> 00:56:52,277
And don't! He's not the king.

903
00:56:52,278 --> 00:56:52,883
Are you?

904
00:56:52,884 --> 00:56:54,264
- No.
- Simba!

905
00:56:54,265 --> 00:56:57,286
No, I'm not the king.
Maybe I was gonna be,

906
00:56:57,287 --> 00:56:59,288
but that was a long time ago.

907
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:00,671
Let me get this straight.

908
00:57:00,672 --> 00:57:03,285
You're the king?
And you never told us?

909
00:57:03,369 --> 00:57:06,121
- Look, I'm still the same guy.
- But with power.

910
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:09,082
Could you guys excuse us
for a few minutes?

911
00:57:09,334 --> 00:57:11,126
Hey, whatever she has to say,

912
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,295
she can say in front of us, right, Simba?

913
00:57:13,921 --> 00:57:15,047
Mm...

914
00:57:15,506 --> 00:57:16,800
Maybe you'd better go.

915
00:57:18,217 --> 00:57:21,345
It starts.
You think you know a guy.

916
00:57:24,724 --> 00:57:28,268
Timon and Pumbaa,
you learn to love 'em.

917
00:57:30,605 --> 00:57:32,022
What?

918
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:34,816
What is it?

919
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,278
It's like you're back from the dead.

920
00:57:38,821 --> 00:57:42,324
You don't know how much
this will mean to everyone.

921
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,284
What it means to me.

922
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:48,163
- Hey, it's okay.
- I've really missed you.

923
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:50,749
I've missed you, too.

924
00:57:52,543 --> 00:57:56,363
I tell you, Pumbaa.
This stinks.

925
00:57:56,364 --> 00:57:57,964
Oh, sorry.

926
00:57:58,049 --> 00:58:00,217
Not you! Them!

927
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,722
Him, her, alone.

928
00:58:04,024 --> 00:58:05,430

But I don't understand something.

972

You've been alive all this time.

973
01:01:08,281 --> 01:01:10,365
Why didn't you
come back to Pride Rock?

974
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:13,919
Well, I just needed
to get out on my own,

975
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,287
live my own life.

976
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:17,065
And I did, and it's great.

977
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:19,177
We've really needed you at home.

978
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,129
No one needs me.

979
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,450
Yes, we do. You're the king.

980
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:25,825
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king.

981
01:01:25,826 --> 01:01:27,549
Scar is.

982
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,795
Simba, he let the hyenas
take over the Pride Lands.

983
01:01:30,796 --> 01:01:32,971
- What?
- Everything's destroyed.

984
01:01:32,972 --> 01:01:34,598
There's no food, no water.

985
01:01:34,682 --> 01:01:36,452
Simba, if you don't do something soon,

986
01:01:36,453 --> 01:01:37,475
everyone will starve.

987
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:38,810
- I can't go back.
- Why?

988
01:01:38,811 --> 01:01:41,027
- You wouldn't understand.
- What?

989
01:01:41,028 --> 01:01:42,552
No, no, no. It doesn't matter.

990
01:01:42,553 --> 01:01:43,815
Hakuna matata.

991
01:01:43,816 --> 01:01:45,650
- What?
- Hakuna matata.

992
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:47,471
It's something I learned out here.

993
01:01:47,472 --> 01:01:49,437
Sometimes bad things happen...

994
01:01:49,438 --> 01:01:50,032
Simba...

995
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:53,707
and there's nothing you can do
about it. So why worry?

996
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:55,358
Because it's your responsibility.

997
01:01:56,693 --> 01:01:58,130
Well, what about you?
You left.

998
01:01:58,456 --> 01:02:01,291
I left to find help, and I found you.

999
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,960
Don't you understand?

1000
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:05,795
You're our only hope.

1001
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,215
- Sorry.
- What's happened to you?

1002
01:02:09,216 --> 01:02:10,626
You're not the Simba I remember.

1003
01:02:10,627 --> 01:02:12,844
You're right. I'm not.

1004
01:02:12,845 --> 01:02:16,195
- Now are you satisfied?
- No. Just disappointed.

1005
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:19,309
You know, you're starting
to sound like my father.

1006
01:02:19,393 --> 01:02:22,110
Good. At least one of us does.

1007
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:25,857
You think you can just show up
and tell me how to live my life?

1008
01:02:25,858 --> 01:02:27,385
You don't even know
what I've been through.

1009
01:02:27,386 --> 01:02:29,261
I would if you'd just tell me.

1010
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:31,196
- Forget it!
- Fine!

1011
01:02:34,769 --> 01:02:37,869
She's wrong. I can't go back.

1012
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:42,040
What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.

1013
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:44,125
You can't change the past.

1014
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,900

But you're not.

1016

Would you slow down?

1057
01:05:37,216 --> 01:05:39,384
Stop!

1058
01:05:44,223 --> 01:05:45,723
Look down there.

1059
01:06:10,816 --> 01:06:13,877
That's not my father.
That's just my reflection.

1060
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:15,628
No.

1061
01:06:16,755 --> 01:06:19,591
Look harder.

1062
01:06:25,806 --> 01:06:27,140
You see?

1063
01:06:28,434 --> 01:06:30,935
He lives in you.

1064
01:06:35,107 --> 01:06:37,775
MUFASA: Simba.

1065
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,485
Father?

1066
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:50,163
Simba, you have forgotten me.

1067
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:52,373
No. How could I?

1068
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:57,212
You have forgotten who you are,
and so have forgotten me.

1069
01:06:57,296 --> 01:06:59,964
Look inside yourself, Simba.

1070
01:06:59,965 --> 01:07:03,801
You are more than
what you have become.

1071
01:07:03,802 --> 01:07:07,138
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

1072
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:09,304
How can I go back?

1073
01:07:09,305 --> 01:07:11,142
I'm not who I used to be.

1074
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:15,146
Remember who you are.

1075
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:19,150
You are my son
and the one true king.

1076
01:07:21,028 --> 01:07:24,656
Remember who you are.

1077
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,575
No! Please, don't leave me!

1078
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:28,710
MUFASA: Remember.

1079
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,822
- Father!
- Remember!

1080
01:07:30,823 --> 01:07:32,622
Don't leave me.

1081
01:07:32,623 --> 01:07:34,540
Remember.

1082
01:07:43,133 --> 01:07:45,076
What was that? Ha ha!

1083
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,970
The weather.

1084
01:07:47,054 --> 01:07:49,745
Very peculiar, don't you think?

1085
01:07:49,746 --> 01:07:50,723
Yeah.

1086
01:07:51,308 --> 01:07:52,809
Looks like the winds are changing.

1087
01:07:52,893 --> 01:07:55,436
Ahh, change is good.

1088
01:07:55,854 --> 01:07:57,689
Yeah, but it's not easy.

1089
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,775
I know what I have to do, but...

1090
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:02,577
going back means
I'll have to face my past.

1091
01:08:03,862 --> 01:08:05,947
I've been running from it
for so long.

1092
01:08:06,865 --> 01:08:09,200
Ow! Jeez!
What was that for?

1093
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:12,161
It doesn't matter.
It's in the past.

1094
01:08:12,246 --> 01:08:14,247
Yeah, but it still hurts.

1095
01:08:14,331 --> 01:08:16,624
Oh, yes, the past can hurt.

1096
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:20,295
But the way I see it
you can either run from it

1097
01:08:20,379 --> 01:08:23,214
or learn from it.

1098
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:26,092
Ah! You see?
So what are you going to do?

1099
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:28,761
First, I'm gonna take your stick.

1100
01:08:28,846 --> 01:08:31,097
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!

1101
01:08:31,181 --> 01:08:34,767
- Hey! Where are you going?
- I'm going back!

1102
01:08:34,852 --> 01:08:37,770
Good! Go on! Get out of here!

1103
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,734
Whoo! Ha ha ha!

1104
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:46,821
Whoooo! Whoooo!

1105
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:55,830
Grubs! Grubs!

1106
01:09:01,378 --> 01:09:03,338
Hey. Hey, wake up.

1107
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:10,762
It's okay! Whoa, whoa!
It's okay! It's me!

1108
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:14,307
Don't ever do that again.

1109
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,309
Carnivores! Oy!

1110
01:09:16,393 --> 01:09:19,020
- Have you guys seen Simba?
- I thought he was with you.

1111
01:09:19,104 --> 01:09:20,674
He was, but now I can't find him.

1112
01:09:20,675 --> 01:09:21,773
Where is he?

1113
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:23,816
Ho ho! You won't find him here!

1114
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:27,236
The king has returned.

1115
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:30,531
I can't believe it. He's gone back!

1116
01:09:30,616 --> 01:09:32,450
Gone back? What do you mean?

1117
01:09:32,618 --> 01:09:35,536
Hey, what's goin' on here?

1118
01:09:35,621 --> 01:09:37,955
- Who's the monkey?
- Simba went back to challenge Scar.

1119
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,073
- Who?
- Scar.

1120
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:41,042
- Who's got a scar?
- No, it's his uncle.

1121
01:09:41,126 --> 01:09:42,877
- The monkey's his uncle?
- No!

1122
01:09:42,961 --> 01:09:46,547
Simba's gone back to challenge
his uncle to take his place as king.

1123
01:09:46,632 --> 01:09:47,924
BOTH: Oh.

1124
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:47,191
NALA: Simba, wait up!

1125
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,000
It's awful, isn't it?

1126
01:10:52,774 --> 01:10:55,324
I didn't want to believe you.

1127
01:10:55,325 --> 01:10:56,645
What made you come back?

1128
01:10:57,436 --> 01:11:00,071
I finally got some sense
knocked into me,

1129
01:11:00,072 --> 01:11:02,415
and I've got the bump to prove it.

1130
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:05,209
Besides, this is my kingdom.

1131
01:11:05,544 --> 01:11:08,337
If I don't fight for it, who will?

1132
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:11,424
- I will.
- It's gonna be dangerous.

1133
01:11:11,508 --> 01:11:12,929
Danger? Ha!

1134
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:15,626
I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha!

1135
01:11:15,627 --> 01:11:17,805
I see nothing funny about this.

1136
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:20,892
Timon! Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?

1137
01:11:21,018 --> 01:11:23,144
At your service, my liege.

1138
01:11:23,228 --> 01:11:25,569
Aww! We're gonna fight your uncle

1139
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:26,898
for this?

1140
01:11:27,357 --> 01:11:29,975
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1141
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:33,070
Oh. Talk about your fixer-upper!

1142
01:11:33,405 --> 01:11:34,474
Well, Simba,

1143
01:11:34,475 --> 01:11:37,264
if it's important to you,
we're with you to the end.

1144
01:11:56,428 --> 01:12:00,306
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.

1145
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:02,850
So what's your plan
for getting past those guys?

1146
01:12:03,227 --> 01:12:06,312
- Live bait.
- Good idea. Hey!

1147
01:12:06,396 --> 01:12:09,505
Come on, Timon. You guys
have to create a diversion.

1148
01:12:09,506 --> 01:12:11,901
What do you want me to do,
dress in drag and do the hula?

1149
01:12:13,201 --> 01:12:14,068
Luau!

1150
01:12:14,069 --> 01:12:15,886
<i>♪ If you're hungry for a hunk ♪
♪ of fat and juicy meat ♪</i>

1151
01:12:15,887 --> 01:12:17,850
<i>♪ Eat my buddy Pumbaa here ♪
♪ because he is a treat ♪</i>

1152
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:19,703
<i>♪ Come on down and dine ♪
♪ on this tasty swine ♪</i>

1153
01:12:19,704 --> 01:12:21,753
<i>♪ All you have to do is get in line ♪</i>

1154
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,632
- Are you achin'
- Yep, yep, yep.

1155
01:12:23,633 --> 01:12:25,435
- For some bacon?
- Yep, yep, yep.

1156
01:12:25,616 --> 01:12:27,376
- He's a big pig.
- Yep, yep.

1157
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:29,444
You could be a big pig, too! Oi!

1158
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,885
Nala, you find my mother
and rally the lionesses.

1159
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:39,177
I'll look for Scar.

1160
01:12:43,008 --> 01:12:45,017
Sarabi!

1161
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,908
Yes, Scar?

1162
01:13:00,993 --> 01:13:04,453
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing their job.

1163
01:13:04,538 --> 01:13:07,665
Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.

1164
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:10,251
No, you're just not
looking hard enough.

1165
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:14,255
It's over.
There is nothing left.

1166
01:13:14,339 --> 01:13:18,217
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.

1167
01:13:18,343 --> 01:13:19,744
We're not going anywhere.

1168
01:13:19,745 --> 01:13:21,746
You have sentenced us to death.

1169
01:13:21,747 --> 01:13:24,015
- Then so be it.
- You can't do that.

1170
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:26,475
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.

1171
01:13:26,476 --> 01:13:28,754
If you were half the king Mufasa was...

1172
01:13:28,755 --> 01:13:31,264
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!

1173
01:13:34,568 --> 01:13:36,986
Mufasa? No, you're dead.

1174
01:13:44,283 --> 01:13:45,911
Mufasa?

1175
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:49,332
No. It's me.

1176
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:53,038
Simba! You're alive?

1177
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,065
How can that be?

1178
01:13:55,066 --> 01:13:58,666
It doesn't matter.
I'm home.

1179
01:13:59,051 --> 01:14:00,154
Simba?

1180
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,130
Simba!

1181
01:14:02,131 --> 01:14:05,736
Oh, I'm a little surprised
to see you

1182
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:06,599
alive.

1183
01:14:08,226 --> 01:14:10,013
Give me one good reason

1184
01:14:10,014 --> 01:14:11,771
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1185
01:14:11,855 --> 01:14:13,814
Oh, Simba, you must understand.

1186
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:16,159
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

1187
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,612
Are no longer yours.
Step down, Scar.

1188
01:14:19,696 --> 01:14:22,239
Oh, well, I would, naturally.

1189
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:25,576
However, there is one little problem.

1190
01:14:25,577 --> 01:14:27,036
You see them?

1191
01:14:28,747 --> 01:14:31,040
They think I'm king.

1192
01:14:31,124 --> 01:14:32,403
<i>Well, we don't.</i>

1193
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,877
Simba's the rightful king.

1194
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:37,254
The choice is yours, Scar.

1195
01:14:37,255 --> 01:14:38,999
Either step down or fight.

1196
01:14:39,611 --> 01:14:42,468
Oh, must this all end in violence?

1197
01:14:42,469 --> 01:14:46,263
I'd hate to be responsible
for the death of a family member.

1198
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:49,600
- Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
- That's not gonna work, Scar.

1199
01:14:50,102 --> 01:14:51,210
I've put it behind me.

1200
01:14:51,211 --> 01:14:53,110
But what about your faithful subjects?

1201
01:14:53,111 --> 01:14:54,790
Have they put it behind them?

1202
01:14:55,273 --> 01:14:57,158
Simba, what is he talking about?

1203
01:14:57,442 --> 01:15:01,696
Ah, so you haven't told them
your little secret.

1204
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:05,241
Well, Simba,
now's your chance to tell them.

1205
01:15:05,242 --> 01:15:09,412
Tell them who is responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1206
01:15:12,457 --> 01:15:13,344
I am.

1207
01:15:18,004 --> 01:15:20,548
It's not true.

1208
01:15:20,966 --> 01:15:23,100
Tell me it's not true.

1209
01:15:24,845 --> 01:15:25,937
It's true.

1210
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:28,398
You see? He admits it!

1211
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,183
- Murderer!
- No! It was an accident.

1212
01:15:31,184 --> 01:15:33,509
If it weren't for you,
Mufasa would still be alive.

1213
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:34,801
It's your fault he's dead!

1214
01:15:34,802 --> 01:15:36,564
- Do you deny it?
- No.

1215
01:15:36,648 --> 01:15:38,926
Then you're guilty.

1216
01:15:38,927 --> 01:15:40,701
No, I'm not a murderer!

1217
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:43,195
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again,

1218
01:15:43,321 --> 01:15:46,365
but this time
daddy isn't here to save you,

1219
01:15:46,366 --> 01:15:49,660
and now everyone knows why!

1220
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:51,829
Simba!

1221
01:15:57,419 --> 01:16:02,006
Now, this looks familiar. Hmm.

1222
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,999
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think. Hmm.

1223
01:16:06,136 --> 01:16:08,763
Oh, yes. I remember.

1224
01:16:09,347 --> 01:16:13,017
This is just the way
your father looked before he died.

1225
01:16:14,895 --> 01:16:18,606
And here's my little secret.

1226
01:16:19,065 --> 01:16:22,193
I killed Mufasa.

1227
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:26,906
No! Murderer!

1228
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:30,159
- No, Simba, please.
- Tell them the truth.

1229
01:16:30,243 --> 01:16:33,603
Truth? But truth is in
the eye of the behold...

1230
01:16:34,414 --> 01:16:35,598
All right.

1231
01:16:36,112 --> 01:16:37,568
All right.

1232
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:39,999
I did it.

1233
01:16:40,378 --> 01:16:42,000
So they can hear you.

1234
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:46,209
I killed Mufasa!

1235
01:16:56,561 --> 01:16:58,604
Hee-yah!

1236
01:16:59,022 --> 01:17:01,899
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Comin' through. Hot stuff. Whoo!

1237
01:17:28,218 --> 01:17:29,718
Aagghh!

1238
01:17:31,221 --> 01:17:33,722
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Let me in! Let me in!

1239
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:37,434
Please, don't eat me.

1240
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:38,694
Drop 'em!

1241
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:41,605
- Hey, who's the pig?
- Are you talkin' to me?

1242
01:17:41,606 --> 01:17:43,649
- Uh-oh. He called him a pig.
- Are you talkin' to me?

1243
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:45,356
- Shouldn't have done that.
- Are you talkin' to me?

1244
01:17:45,469 --> 01:17:51,282
- Now they're in for it.
- They call me Mr. Pig!

1245
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:54,410
Aaaaggghhh!

1246
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:57,204
<i>Take that, you stupid...</i>

1247
01:17:57,289 --> 01:17:59,290
<i>Take that and that!</i>

1248
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:04,920
Run, you yellow-belly!

1249
01:18:05,088 --> 01:18:06,630
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

1250
01:18:24,983 --> 01:18:27,818
- Murderer.
- Simba. Simba, please.

1251
01:18:27,944 --> 01:18:29,851
Please, have mercy. I beg you.

1252
01:18:29,852 --> 01:18:31,822
You don't deserve to live.

1253
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:37,328
But Simba, I am family.

1254
01:18:37,662 --> 01:18:41,185
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.

1255
01:18:41,186 --> 01:18:43,366
It was their fault.
It was their idea.

1256
01:18:43,367 --> 01:18:45,711
Why should I believe you?

1257
01:18:46,212 --> 01:18:48,881
Everything you ever told me was a lie.

1258
01:18:48,965 --> 01:18:50,925
What are you going to do?

1259
01:18:51,009 --> 01:18:54,595
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.

1260
01:18:55,013 --> 01:18:57,139
No, Scar.

1261
01:18:57,474 --> 01:18:59,016
I'm not like you.

1262
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,375
Oh, Simba, thank you.

1263
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:04,142
You are truly noble.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

1264
01:19:04,143 --> 01:19:06,315
And how can I prove myself to you?

1265
01:19:06,316 --> 01:19:07,720
Tell me. I mean, anything.

1266
01:19:08,401 --> 01:19:10,027
Run.

1267
01:19:10,028 --> 01:19:12,154
Run away, Scar,

1268
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,159
and never return.

1269
01:19:15,408 --> 01:19:17,409
Er... Yes.

1270
01:19:17,494 --> 01:19:19,620
Of course.

1271
01:19:19,704 --> 01:19:22,373
As you wish,

1272
01:19:22,499 --> 01:19:24,541
your Majesty!

1273
01:20:17,762 --> 01:20:21,065
Ah, my friends!

1274
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:25,185
Friends? I thought he said
we were the enemy.

1275
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:28,022
Yeah. That's what I heard.

1276
01:20:28,273 --> 01:20:29,606
Ed?

1277
01:20:33,653 --> 01:20:38,198
No. Let me explain.
No, you don't understand!

1278
01:20:38,283 --> 01:20:40,701
No, I didn't mean... No! No!

1279
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:48,769
It is time.

1280
01:22:13,711 --> 01:22:16,922
MUFASA: Remember.

1281
01:22:30,311 --> 01:22:32,229
