1
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:37,876
One can prevent mildew
by spraying with copper sulfate.

2
00:00:37,918 --> 00:00:41,251
There are two
classic solutions used...

3
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:46,658
in Bordeaux and Burgundy...

4
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:49,821
French provinces
well-known for their wines.

5
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:52,991
Three treatments are necessary--

6
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:57,595
the first one when the sprouts
reach twelve centimeters...

7
00:00:57,637 --> 00:01:01,095
the second one just before
or after the blooming...

8
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:03,268
and the third one a month later.

9
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,040
This spraying with sulfate
is purely preventative...

10
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,637
and should never be neglected.

11
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:11,412
I'll conclude with the means
of preventing mildew.

12
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:13,282
Like each year...

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,780
airdropped leaflets
will be at your disposal.

14
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,520
Those leaflets will remind
the peasants of the mildew...

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,085
deadly disease for the vine
that appeared...

16
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,066
along with this new
ideological disease...

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,067
that ravages men.

18
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:31,628
But the chief of police
will develop this point.

19
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:44,641
Any similarity to actual
persons or events is deliberate.

20
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:48,684
As the Under Secretary
of Agriculture said...

21
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:51,714
three treatments are necessary.

22
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:55,558
An ideological illness
is like mildew...

23
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:57,563
and requires
preventative measures.

24
00:01:57,597 --> 00:02:01,795
Like mildew,
it is due to septic germs...

25
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:04,599
and various parasitic agents.

26
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:10,167
So the treatment of men
with appropriate solutions...

27
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,144
is indispensable.

28
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:17,515
The first stage occurs
in the schools, where...

29
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,610
if you'll pardon the metaphor...

30
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:23,783
the sprouts
are still very young.

31
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:28,284
The second treatment occurs
when they begin to bloom...

32
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:32,424
as college students
or young workers.

33
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:35,629
The draft is
the best time to spray...

34
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,763
and save the sacred tree
of national liberty...

35
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:42,002
from the disease
of ideological mildew.

36
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:47,105
Airdropped leaflets
are telling our peasants...

37
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:50,310
of a new kind
of ideological mildew...

38
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,682
beginning to ravage our land.

39
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,782
This new variety is
spreading insidiously.

40
00:02:57,824 --> 00:02:59,052
It's a sly enemy...

41
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:02,152
pushing us away from God
and the Crown.

42
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:07,360
It's against this enemy
that our action is aimed.

43
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,767
Don't take notes!
It's all in our pamphlet.

44
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:14,868
With the outbreak
of isms like...

45
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:20,244
socialism, anarchism,
imperialism, or communism...

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,147
sunspots start to multiply...

47
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:25,481
on the face
of the golden orb.

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,621
God refuses to
enlighten the Reds!

49
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:33,592
Scientists forecast
an increase in sunspots...

50
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:38,724
due to the arrival
of beatniks and pacifists...

51
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:41,598
from certain countries such as
Italy, France, and Scandinavia!

52
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:46,562
As head of law and order
here in the North...

53
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:51,202
I wish to tell you
who are high civil servants...

54
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:53,405
we must preserve...

55
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:55,846
the healthy elements
of our society...

56
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:59,010
and heal those that are ill.

57
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:04,149
Tonight, the enemy's holding
a meeting in our city.

58
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,351
But we are not an ism !

59
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:08,258
We are a democracy!

60
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,786
We won't forbid the meeting.

61
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,991
Nor will we forbid...

62
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,695
the opposition
from demonstrating!

63
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:22,937
With these healthy antibodies,
we must fight all diseases...

64
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:26,571
of the vine
as well as society.

65
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:28,137
That's all I have to say.

66
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:37,780
Bear it in mind
during the days to come!

67
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:41,557
Having lunch?

68
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:42,823
Rapidly.

69
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:44,727
I'll take you to your plane.

70
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:45,731
Thank you.

71
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:48,427
It's my pleasure.

72
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:58,878
Tell my wife
I'll pick her up this evening.

73
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:02,348
An excursion
for the Bolshoi ballerinas.

74
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:07,380
From Moscow?

75
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,911
The Bolshoi ballet is here
for four days.

76
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:11,583
They open tonight.

77
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:15,194
Stay over.
You can sit in my box.

78
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:17,389
I must return to the capital.

79
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,455
Ah, the capital. The palace.

80
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:21,694
The palace thinks well of you.

81
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:30,500
What if one of them
chose freedom here?

82
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:32,670
Like that famous dancer--

83
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,839
No. None of that.

84
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:38,078
For freedom, they pick
London or the U.S...

85
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:39,107
where the money's stable.

86
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:44,621
We have
enough hotheads in town.

87
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,558
Enough problems.

88
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,857
Stop! Take that down!

89
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:52,058
No permits needed
for a meeting indoors!

90
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:54,032
I don't want any trouble!

91
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:57,127
Get a permit to use the hall!

92
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,001
Do as I say!

93
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,339
Bring me your permit
or meet elsewhere!

94
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:04,343
Take it down!

95
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:06,845
How can we find
another hall now...

96
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,509
and tell 3,000 or 4,000
people about it?

97
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:12,917
It's a rally!

98
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:15,512
You signed the receipt.

99
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:18,881
Now it's unsigned!

100
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,392
Here's your check.

101
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:23,419
I'll pay you compensation.

102
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,124
You got threats.

103
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:26,826
I don't know what you mean.

104
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:31,098
You don't cancel a rental
unless you're pressured.

105
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:33,505
You lawyers are--

106
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,304
Bozini, you're an honest man.

107
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:39,243
Who's behind all this? Why?

108
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:44,177
I don't want you
in my hall, that's why!

109
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:45,946
If you don't like it,
lump it.

110
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:47,919
There must be a reason.

111
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:50,184
My father died today, OK?

112
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:01,600
I'd gladly let you see it...

113
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:05,900
but the city inspector came by.

114
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,770
-When?
-Yesterday.

115
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:10,105
The seats must be specially set.

116
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:13,408
We can set them this afternoon.

117
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:15,937
No. Fastened to the floor.

118
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:17,916
It will take a week at least.

119
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:19,475
Since when?

120
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,046
We cancel or meet in the street.

121
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:24,613
And without a permit.

122
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:27,319
That would mean
instigators and cops.

123
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,260
We won't find a hall.

124
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:31,092
They'll all refuse.

125
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:33,622
I say, we have to cancel it.

126
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,964
He'd never agree.

127
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:39,233
We cancel it and go
quietly off to bed...

128
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:42,173
or better yet,
to the Bolshoi opening.

129
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,472
And we take him there, too?

130
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:46,638
And send his audience there?

131
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,010
You got a hall?

132
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:49,014
The Bolshoi.

133
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,845
A plot on the doctor's life.

134
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:51,908
Says who?

135
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:52,918
My wife.

136
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:54,317
Who told you?

137
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:56,288
None of my business?

138
00:07:56,322 --> 00:07:58,847
What will we tell the police?

139
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:00,860
Don't hang up.

140
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:02,088
She won't say.

141
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:05,393
The guy didn't know
the doctor's due today.

142
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,467
This is George Pirou.

143
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:10,526
You must tell us who--

144
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,094
Certainly not!

145
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:14,039
I trust him.

146
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:17,338
He didn't know
about tonight's meeting.

147
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:18,742
He overheard a discussion.

148
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,042
He won't tell you. Me neither.

149
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:24,777
He's had enough trouble.

150
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,649
He has a family.

151
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:28,313
Now they know.

152
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:31,323
Now you know.
So do something.

153
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:33,188
It's for you.

154
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:37,795
I know, darling.
See you later.

155
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:40,299
What do we do?

156
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,460
Call the Red Cross.

157
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:44,264
Attorney General.

158
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:46,966
It's all quite vague.

159
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:51,670
An anonymous witness...
an overheard conversation.

160
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,169
Maybe it's a hoax
or a chronic liar...

161
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:58,912
like those who phone
there's a bomb on a plane.

162
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:01,147
Who'd want to kill
your president?

163
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:03,178
Marie, open the door.

164
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:05,613
Shall we go?

165
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:15,597
I'll call the head of security.

166
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:20,571
He'll provide protection...
unofficially.

167
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:23,167
We've no basis for any action.

168
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:31,582
Yes, I'm interested
in the Paris Commune.

169
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:33,552
I'm late.

170
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:35,713
You'll come
to the theater tonight?

171
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:39,418
As for the hall,
I can do nothing.

172
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,893
The colonel.

173
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:46,258
Property rights can't be
infringed upon...

174
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:49,097
even though some
may want to change that.

175
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:54,400
-Yes, Papa?
-Niki, see to our guest.

176
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,032
In two seconds.

177
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:00,943
He's a fine magistrate.

178
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,144
He's out?
Give me his duty officer.

179
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:07,152
You know about tonight?

180
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:09,177
Not the Bolshoi.

181
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,020
Yes. The doctor's life
has been threatened.

182
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:18,324
No, but he's due to arrive--

183
00:10:18,364 --> 00:10:19,331
shortly.

184
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,526
He'll arrive shortly.

185
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,025
No...on the phone.

186
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,561
Like you say.

187
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:28,039
Tell the colonel I phoned.

188
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:35,037
''All quite vague.
No basis for any action.''

189
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:36,878
The doctor will be mad
when he hears...

190
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,076
we asked those puppets for help.

191
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:39,880
-Puppets?
-Of the U.S.A.

192
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,615
What can't they have
to do with it?

193
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:45,920
Always blame the U.S.A.,
even if you're wrong.

194
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,120
Cut it out.
You're not always funny.

195
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:18,848
There they are.

196
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:20,614
The police?

197
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:24,521
They've tailed me
for three days.

198
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:26,525
Everything's set?

199
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,960
No. We lost our hall,
and no one knows it.

200
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:32,624
They want to sabotage
the meeting.

201
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:34,064
Who can fix it?

202
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,567
Only the head of security.

203
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:39,264
We'll see him after lunch.

204
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:40,863
Let's go now.

205
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,036
Then to the hotel.

206
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:47,069
Your life's been threatened.

207
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:50,344
A guy overheard
some talk about it.

208
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:51,509
We'll ask the cops--

209
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,145
for nothing.

210
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,417
Just for a hall, that's all.

211
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:04,957
This hall does not meet
safety regulations.

212
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:08,956
It was in use two weeks ago.

213
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,469
Here's the report.

214
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,029
It has no emergency exit.

215
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:16,371
It never did.

216
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:21,779
With a normal show,
there's no danger.

217
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:26,312
Your rally might excite people.

218
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,982
It is in no way dangerous.

219
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:34,049
I've no reason to hinder
your meeting.

220
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:38,359
My decision is based
on reports.

221
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:40,456
I'm neutral in this affair.

222
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,559
Then why are we being tailed?

223
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:44,331
For your safety.

224
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,498
The Minister of Interior
ordered us...

225
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,807
to protect your committee
members from extremists.

226
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:56,281
Whom you are using.

227
00:13:56,315 --> 00:14:01,309
Other halls meet
the safety requirements...

228
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:06,382
like the Employees' Union Hall
opposite your hotel.

229
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:08,723
You simply cross the square.

230
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:13,221
I'm neutral in this affair.

231
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:14,597
All right, Colonel.

232
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:23,135
There on the first floor.

233
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:26,543
Not room for over 200 people.

234
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:27,546
We'll look stupid.

235
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,516
In a city of 500,000,
only 200 would hear you.

236
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:32,950
The rest will be outside.

237
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:37,854
Ask the colonel to let us hang
loudspeakers from the trees.

238
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,120
Permit or not,
people will be here.

239
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:09,314
We'll go now and try
to alert people.

240
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,849
Print posters with the rally's
change of address.

241
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:18,330
Manuel, come discuss my speech.

242
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:19,695
George, you, too.

243
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,131
I'll hold on.

244
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:30,500
Hello, darling. How are you?

245
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:32,033
Fine. Yes.

246
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,741
Problems with the hall,
as usual.

247
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:42,081
Why should there be any fights?

248
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:44,885
Why any fights?

249
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:47,552
Yes. Tomorrow.

250
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:50,118
George sends a kiss.

251
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:52,592
Till tomorrow, darling.

252
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:56,159
The kids?

253
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:58,966
Fine, but I don't
see them enough.

254
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,768
Helen?

255
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:03,798
We don't always see
eye to eye...

256
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:05,868
but it's not serious.

257
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:09,642
They say a hungry bear
won't dance.

258
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:12,116
The bears are going
to read that.

259
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:16,384
Your pen.

260
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:44,476
Go!

261
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:04,998
Hold your meetings in Russia!

262
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:07,767
We'd rather stay here!

263
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:08,933
Do as you're told!

264
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:13,571
Hey, you.

265
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:20,142
What's the idea?

266
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:16,735
Never mind.

267
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:18,396
Better than the Bolshoi?

268
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:21,770
I only came to please you.

269
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:23,798
Your dancers are old hat.

270
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:27,438
Except when one chooses freedom.

271
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,607
And the Warsaw Pact?

272
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:34,112
We're against the bomb,
Russian or American!

273
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:35,484
Disarmament!

274
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:41,123
Long live the bomb!

275
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:05,841
You could sell them
to the ''Daily Worker.''

276
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:06,977
They are blas.

277
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,611
So are they.

278
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:10,212
No more NATO bases!

279
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:13,714
Calm down! No fighting!
No provocation!

280
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,626
You just ease them away.
You don't push.

281
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:17,993
Leave them alone.

282
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,691
Calm down!

283
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:21,563
Don't provoke them !

284
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,125
Mr. Lawyer!

285
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,535
Start now!

286
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:29,132
There's no more room up there!

287
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:30,869
Squeeze them in!

288
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,241
Get the speakers.

289
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:35,139
Ready?

290
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,670
I'll get them.

291
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:44,783
Go on in.

292
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,955
Let them in.

293
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:17,119
So that's it.

294
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:18,316
What?

295
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:23,420
The new opposition.
Women go for him.

296
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:24,429
Communist?

297
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:28,229
Never. He's antiforeign.

298
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,996
Next election, he'll win.

299
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:32,003
Good-looking.

300
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:35,700
Ex-Olympic champ, doc,
college professor...

301
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:36,901
and honest politician.

302
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:38,307
Perfection.

303
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:40,539
He's at the Bolshoi.

304
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:42,604
He must cancel it.

305
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:43,945
We back down.

306
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:46,315
To avoid provoking the crowd.

307
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:48,843
The students
could maintain order.

308
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:49,979
A free-for-all!

309
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:52,286
You and your nonviolence.

310
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:54,758
We must respect the law.

311
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:56,693
The law of the jungle.

312
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:59,254
They stuck us in that hall.

313
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:00,890
It's a trap.

314
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:02,366
Set by whom?

315
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:06,896
The C.I.A. We want the
foreign bases to be dismantled.

316
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:08,338
You think too much.

317
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:10,934
There are some
stubborn extremists.

318
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:12,273
The threats?

319
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:14,142
It's not the first time.

320
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,079
We've all taken risks.

321
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:19,946
They're all at the Bolshoi.

322
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,314
Keep trying.

323
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:25,380
The police must face
their responsibility.

324
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,857
We're going to our rally.

325
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:30,752
Rotten politicians!

326
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:06,724
We'll put you in your graves!

327
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:10,399
We'll kill you all!

328
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:40,885
Stay outside.

329
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:56,167
-And you?
-I'm a mason.

330
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:18,092
OK, let's go.

331
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:41,512
They hit me.

332
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:43,882
Why?

333
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:50,922
Why do our ideas provoke
such violence?

334
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:57,165
Why don't they like peace?

335
00:25:57,202 --> 00:26:00,729
Why don't they attack
other organizations?

336
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:03,138
The answer is simple.

337
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:07,703
The others are nationalists
used by the government...

338
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:10,715
and don't upset our
Judas allies who betray us.

339
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:14,412
General, they're getting
out of hand.

340
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:16,887
I'll have the loudspeakers
cut off.

341
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,923
It would excite the others.

342
00:26:21,293 --> 00:26:22,317
Don't do that.

343
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:27,564
Where's the chief of police?

344
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,965
I was told he's here.

345
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:32,994
Really? He must be over there.

346
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:36,399
We lack hospitals and doctors...

347
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:40,969
but half the budget goes
for military expenditures.

348
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:55,486
He's the one!

349
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:14,336
A cannon is fired...

350
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:18,543
and a teacher's monthly salary
goes up in smoke!

351
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:26,051
That's why they can't bear us
or our meetings...

352
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:29,993
and use hired thugs
to jeer and attack us.

353
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:36,960
Around the world, too many
soldiers are ready to fire...

354
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:38,970
on anything moving
toward progress.

355
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:41,433
He's our guy?

356
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:42,440
You sure?

357
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:43,668
I think.

358
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,176
An Olympic champ?

359
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:03,889
Stop!

360
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:10,294
Finish him off.

361
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,344
Shit! It's not him !

362
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:22,472
I told you it wasn't!

363
00:28:22,514 --> 00:28:23,674
They said it was!

364
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:26,677
Take off!

365
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,726
I'll go around
to avoid the cops.

366
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:47,796
Tomatoes out of season.
They cost a fortune.

367
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,636
Fix your muffler.

368
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:52,939
I can't even make
the monthly payments.

369
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:04,649
Shit! The cops!

370
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:07,852
But our fight is theirs, too.

371
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:11,260
We live in a weak
and corrupt society...

372
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:15,164
where it's every man
for himself.

373
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,260
It's blocked off
here, too. Hide.

374
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:22,672
Even imagination is suspect...

375
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:27,269
yet it's needed
to solve world problems.

376
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:30,748
The stockpile of A-bombs
is equal...

377
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:35,151
to one ton of dynamite
per person on Earth.

378
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:36,552
Horny again?

379
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,882
Yeah.

380
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:45,553
They want to prevent us
from reaching the obvious...

381
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:50,557
political conclusions
based on these simple truths...

382
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:52,001
but we will speak out.

383
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:56,970
We serve the people,
and the people need the truth.

384
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,638
Send them back to the Bolshoi.

385
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:08,080
The truth is the start
of powerful, united action.

386
00:30:15,594 --> 00:30:17,562
Get those hoodlums out of here.

387
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:33,743
Down with the police state!

388
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:43,252
No more foreign bases!

389
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:01,228
Inspector!

390
00:31:05,243 --> 00:31:07,336
Chief!

391
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:14,077
What are you waiting for?

392
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:24,953
Watch out!

393
00:31:46,384 --> 00:31:48,215
Throw him off!

394
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:07,120
It's my cousin. He fell off.

395
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:09,697
By his feet.

396
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:14,801
I saw you hit him.

397
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,965
What?

398
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,941
What is going on?

399
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:21,810
I hit the brake,
and my cousin fell off.

400
00:33:21,846 --> 00:33:22,972
He's bleeding and needs care.

401
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:24,208
Your papers.

402
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:27,215
Just a moment.

403
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:33,951
Here they are.

404
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:37,792
He's bleeding. He needs care.

405
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,996
He hit him with a club!

406
00:33:48,573 --> 00:33:49,972
See? It's nothing.

407
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:52,238
This is nothing?

408
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:54,177
He tried to kill him.

409
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:56,305
Dummy! My truck?

410
00:33:56,348 --> 00:34:00,148
It'll be OK.
Call in for a patrol car.

411
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:03,154
Sure. Call the station.

412
00:34:08,093 --> 00:34:09,253
Stay there.

413
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:18,229
Look.

414
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:24,634
I'm going.
Pretend to try to stop me.

415
00:34:24,676 --> 00:34:28,669
I can't explain,
but I got to go. Just play dead.

416
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:30,476
One move and I'll slug you.

417
00:34:38,823 --> 00:34:43,055
What time is it?
I got a date I can't miss.

418
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,907
The regime can't change that.

419
00:35:07,886 --> 00:35:11,344
All the Russians want
is to live like Americans.

420
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:23,356
Quick, sir. It's serious.

421
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:25,926
Come with me.

422
00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:35,312
The Attorney General.

423
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:39,014
We'll talk later.

424
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,814
And the ballet?
I had to miss it.

425
00:35:41,853 --> 00:35:43,411
Why wasn't I told?

426
00:35:43,455 --> 00:35:45,480
During the performance? How?

427
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:49,254
-What is it?
-A stupid traffic accident.

428
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:51,159
The culprit?

429
00:35:51,196 --> 00:35:52,561
We'll have him soon.

430
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:54,064
The victim?

431
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:56,032
The hospital will tell us.

432
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:59,401
I'll go there in your car.

433
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:00,426
Certainly!

434
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:03,202
Have the papers heard about it?

435
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:05,408
I doubt it.

436
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:09,146
I must call the ministry.

437
00:36:17,555 --> 00:36:18,988
Editorial room.

438
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:34,437
What on Earth's wrong?

439
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:38,932
There was a demonstration.
We taught the bastards a lesson.

440
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:43,038
They hold a meeting?
Well, we can demonstrate, too.

441
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:46,778
It's like a biological reaction.

442
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:51,585
Society's healthy elements,
the antibodies.

443
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:53,818
We beat the hell out of them.

444
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:56,827
What do you want from me?

445
00:36:56,861 --> 00:37:02,663
Write that I was there
and beat them up.

446
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,860
What for?

447
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:06,097
So my pals will know.

448
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:10,903
OK. If you want.
Get fixed up at the hospital...

449
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:13,672
so they'll know
both sides were hurt.

450
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:18,045
Go now, and I'll put
your name in the lead.

451
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:43,970
We warned you, but you said
it was a hoax or a crackpot.

452
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:45,339
Please.

453
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:49,904
This attempted killing
is your responsibility.

454
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:52,178
The police have proof
it was an accident.

455
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:02,482
Go easy. We need their help.
Such unfounded accusations.

456
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:06,429
They're blind or worse--
accomplices.

457
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:09,058
They have no proof.

458
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,863
Assassination?

459
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:13,894
I was there taking pictures.

460
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:16,099
You got the truck?

461
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,598
No. I missed it.
The cops chased us away.

462
00:38:19,644 --> 00:38:23,637
Such cynicism. They'll
use the incident politically.

463
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:24,875
Surely!

464
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:27,282
They know how to make martyrs.

465
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:28,580
Death-lovers!

466
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,248
Let's hope he doesn't die.

467
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:33,086
That would suit them.

468
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:39,927
The brain is damaged in two
or three spots. We're operating.

469
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:46,436
His heart is fighting hard,
but it's too soon to say.

470
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:48,666
But you must!

471
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:49,832
He can't hear you.

472
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:51,535
You realize
the political aspect?

473
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:54,204
But the other victim
is out of danger.

474
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:56,679
Other victim?

475
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:59,911
Senator Pirou.
He was found in the street.

476
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:01,885
It's serious,
but he's all right.

477
00:39:02,754 --> 00:39:05,985
Two senators hurt.
Such incompetent police.

478
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:11,093
I must phone the minister
in private.

479
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:17,966
His wife knows?

480
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:20,368
I don't eavesdrop.

481
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:21,927
I'm sure.

482
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:25,539
When is she coming?

483
00:39:25,576 --> 00:39:27,271
Tomorrow, first plane.

484
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:29,871
Tomorrow is today.

485
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:32,380
It's for my paper.

486
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:36,285
What did she say?

487
00:39:36,988 --> 00:39:40,754
Nothing. I heard her breathing.

488
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:43,090
Then she said, ''Will he live?''

489
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:45,759
The director couldn't answer.

490
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:49,062
And she said,
''So they finally did it.''

491
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:02,374
Were you there?

492
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:04,904
I'm a reporter.

493
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,983
I'm afraid the police bungled
it. I wanted no one hurt.

494
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:15,117
Two senators hurt,
one critically!

495
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,751
We have the culprit.

496
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:18,625
Where? I want to see him.

497
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:20,893
He's in the canteen.

498
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,326
The canteen!

499
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:25,528
The cells are in poor condition.

500
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:31,031
No electricity,
so we use them for storage.

501
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:33,806
The minister says
this is serious...

502
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:36,905
and a political catastrophe.

503
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:39,508
If the papers knew
he's in a canteen!

504
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,542
The minister wants
to be kept fully informed.

505
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,491
No handcuffs.

506
00:40:57,568 --> 00:41:00,128
-His son?
-No, a street peddler.

507
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:01,968
-Was he alone?
-No. Two of them.

508
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:04,440
We have the end man's address.

509
00:41:04,475 --> 00:41:07,467
It seems he slept through
the accident.

510
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:09,412
He gave himself up?

511
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:13,247
He was arrested
for drunken driving.

512
00:41:13,284 --> 00:41:14,911
You'll get a report.

513
00:41:16,154 --> 00:41:17,314
Breathe.

514
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:20,415
No alcohol.

515
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:21,857
It's the stew.

516
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:24,885
Mutton stew kills all smells.

517
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:26,863
What have you been doing?

518
00:41:26,898 --> 00:41:28,593
I made the stew.

519
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:34,899
He made it?
And you hid this from me?

520
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:37,965
I didn't know.
I found out later.

521
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:41,137
You weren't told? Since when?

522
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:43,477
Since about 10:30 p.m.

523
00:41:43,514 --> 00:41:46,506
That's harboring a criminal.

524
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:48,746
You knew about it, Colonel?

525
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:54,415
I knew, but I hadn't the time
to tell the general.

526
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,085
Then you arrived.

527
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:59,585
The general said
we didn't have the culprit...

528
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,120
and I couldn't contradict him.

529
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:04,023
Fine.

530
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:12,499
I'll take his statement myself.

531
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:14,306
Get the second culprit.

532
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:16,742
Eat.

533
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:28,557
They're at the presses.

534
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:40,597
Now what? You wear glasses now?

535
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:46,737
It's a disguise. Take my name
off the list. The guy's dying.

536
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:48,176
What's that to you?

537
00:42:48,212 --> 00:42:53,047
Nothing. It was an accident--
two drunks in a pickup truck.

538
00:42:53,084 --> 00:42:57,282
If my name's in the paper,
I'll be questioned.

539
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:59,585
I'll remove it.

540
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:03,023
Are you free now?

541
00:43:05,763 --> 00:43:09,392
No. I can't. I'm busy.

542
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:11,424
You'll have to go.

543
00:43:13,638 --> 00:43:15,606
That way.

544
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:16,296
No one is to move.

545
00:44:17,668 --> 00:44:18,930
What do they want?

546
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,436
To start trouble. We refuse.

547
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:26,534
But how do you explain
it's always ours who are killed?

548
00:44:26,577 --> 00:44:27,703
He's alive.

549
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:30,270
Clinically, he's dead.
Why dream?

550
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:33,376
Clinically dead.

551
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:38,886
The brain's destroyed,
but the heart's still beating.

552
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:41,585
It won't quit.

553
00:44:43,995 --> 00:44:47,192
One word
and they'll tear up the town.

554
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:51,565
Why hold them back? I wonder
if we've any will to fight.

555
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:55,766
He had. That's why
they killed him, not us.

556
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:57,273
Come on.

557
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:00,439
It's all I could find.

558
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:06,283
The papers--
The cops put the blame on us.

559
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:07,875
Coffee?

560
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:11,445
''The broadcasting of the speech
was a provocation.

561
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:12,922
''The antinational tone...

562
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:18,691
''of the attack on foreign policy
aroused the crowd at once.

563
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:21,857
''Hence, the violence.

564
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:26,859
''The police handled
the situation efficiently...

565
00:45:26,904 --> 00:45:29,202
''yet thirteen policemen were
injured in the course of duty.''

566
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,107
So said the general
to the press.

567
00:45:32,143 --> 00:45:34,111
We must answer that!

568
00:45:34,145 --> 00:45:37,410
Yes, and stress the pacifist
nature of our rally.

569
00:45:37,448 --> 00:45:39,040
We had permission.

570
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:41,813
So the cops could do
a better job on us.

571
00:45:41,852 --> 00:45:44,116
But we have no proof.

572
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:47,352
Nothing valid.

573
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,588
We can only deplore
the police's passiveness.

574
00:45:50,628 --> 00:45:54,257
Later, we'll underline
all the contradictions.

575
00:45:55,466 --> 00:45:59,334
Why not call the Red Cross
or the Rights of Man Commission?

576
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:04,136
You're making a crybaby defense.

577
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:07,303
We must attack
and expose those responsible.

578
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:08,971
Take up arms in the streets.

579
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:10,742
-Why not?
-Anything goes.

580
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:13,249
-We can consider--
-Nothing at all!

581
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:18,085
-It must be legal.
-We've been legal for years.

582
00:46:18,122 --> 00:46:21,455
-This is no time to change.
-It's our only way.

583
00:46:21,492 --> 00:46:24,086
Or the affair could backfire.

584
00:46:24,128 --> 00:46:28,827
Aren't you ashamed?
He's dying in there.

585
00:46:33,404 --> 00:46:35,497
We've no case against them.

586
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:38,736
And the threats on his life?

587
00:46:38,776 --> 00:46:40,368
He ignored them, too.

588
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:43,312
But that was yesterday.

589
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:47,384
Will your guy talk now?

590
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:49,147
Statement to the press?

591
00:46:55,693 --> 00:47:01,723
I doubt it. He was scared then
of reprisals...

592
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:03,289
and now, even more.

593
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:06,132
Try! Can you find him?

594
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,364
Not before noon.

595
00:47:07,404 --> 00:47:09,429
We'll have to be careful.

596
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:12,769
We're being watched.

597
00:47:13,677 --> 00:47:14,939
It's them.

598
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:19,712
But they're protecting us.
We're as safe as the doctor.

599
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:40,232
What was your reaction
to the news?

600
00:47:42,173 --> 00:47:45,142
The U.S. President
sent you a telegram?

601
00:47:45,176 --> 00:47:46,803
Saying what?

602
00:47:46,844 --> 00:47:47,970
Happily wed?

603
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:53,239
Was he threatened?

604
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:55,844
You'll let the Reds
exploit this?

605
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,680
Was it an attempted
assassination?

606
00:47:59,723 --> 00:48:02,351
Why did you send
for a British surgeon?

607
00:48:02,393 --> 00:48:05,089
Do you want a divorce?

608
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:07,560
Was it an accident?

609
00:48:15,906 --> 00:48:18,500
They're operating
for the third time.

610
00:48:37,027 --> 00:48:39,791
Here's the hospital director.

611
00:48:45,436 --> 00:48:49,236
Your husband had an accident.

612
00:48:54,845 --> 00:48:59,145
I knew your husband.
We were at school together.

613
00:49:00,284 --> 00:49:02,980
I wanted to go
to his peace marathon...

614
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,011
but it was forbidden.

615
00:49:05,556 --> 00:49:07,490
It's serious, but he'll make it.

616
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,927
Professor Dodd from London
is here.

617
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:16,126
He's one of London's
best surgeons.

618
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:20,601
Want to tell them the truth?
They'll live the truth later.

619
00:49:31,015 --> 00:49:35,247
The fall broke
the dome of the skull...

620
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:38,119
and no doubt the brain
has been affected.

621
00:49:38,155 --> 00:49:40,248
The shock was very violent...

622
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:45,285
causing an explosion inside
the skull like an earthquake.

623
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:49,060
I can't evaluate
the aftereffects...

624
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:52,091
of the concussion
even if the operation succeeds.

625
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:55,003
The third operation
has just begun.

626
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:57,974
His heart is
the only positive factor.

627
00:49:58,008 --> 00:50:02,069
We've massaged
and used adrenaline...

628
00:50:02,112 --> 00:50:03,739
and its resistance is amazing.

629
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:06,341
It's beating regularly.

630
00:50:09,486 --> 00:50:10,680
Come in.

631
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:16,323
General Missou.

632
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,488
A stupid accident.
I'm deeply sorry.

633
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,192
Head of the police.

634
00:50:22,232 --> 00:50:23,426
We have the culprit, a drunk.

635
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:26,527
-Attorney General.
-My sympathies.

636
00:50:27,538 --> 00:50:29,199
The inquest judge.

637
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:50,421
Well, certain areas of the brain
have been affected...

638
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:52,691
but the lesions
can't be defined.

639
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:55,324
But the surgeons are optimistic.

640
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:57,891
We must await the end
of the third operation.

641
00:50:59,002 --> 00:51:01,493
You husband's heart
is exceptional.

642
00:51:01,538 --> 00:51:03,233
If it holds, he'll live.

643
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:06,306
We have every hope.

644
00:51:28,065 --> 00:51:31,159
The capital is on the phone.
The ministry!

645
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:41,075
They'll try to use his wife.

646
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:44,274
They'll use
the people's emotions.

647
00:51:46,517 --> 00:51:47,779
The files.

648
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:56,022
Their committee secretary.

649
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:58,895
I want resumes on each--

650
00:51:58,929 --> 00:52:02,797
details of their private lives
and jobs, too.

651
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:04,357
For this evening.

652
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:06,626
The injured senator.

653
00:52:10,441 --> 00:52:11,931
The other lawyer.

654
00:52:15,646 --> 00:52:17,876
And his? Have it?

655
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:19,143
It just came.

656
00:52:23,654 --> 00:52:25,315
Any love affairs?

657
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:27,289
I don't know, but there must be.

658
00:52:28,225 --> 00:52:31,752
Break his halo.
Does he get along with his wife?

659
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:38,694
-Watching her?
-Like the others, General.

660
00:52:38,735 --> 00:52:42,899
-Two of our men.
-I don't want to know that.

661
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:48,708
They met this morning, picked up
his wife, then separated.

662
00:52:48,745 --> 00:52:53,409
Some took his wife to
the clinic. As for this one...

663
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:57,716
He took a statement
to the press. You have a copy.

664
00:52:58,956 --> 00:53:01,857
They saw
some university student.

665
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:04,360
-Students!
-Call our students.

666
00:53:04,394 --> 00:53:08,797
That one's a mad dog.
He wants to make the most of it.

667
00:53:08,832 --> 00:53:10,857
-A Jew?
-Only half.

668
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:14,359
They think they're superior even
to other Jews.

669
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:18,238
The Attorney General.

670
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:20,436
Stay on him day and night.

671
00:53:21,612 --> 00:53:24,308
We were expecting you.

672
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:27,080
The second culprit?

673
00:53:27,117 --> 00:53:30,280
We have him.
He turned himself in.

674
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,311
Come into my office.

675
00:53:36,393 --> 00:53:38,258
Please sit down.

676
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:44,400
He's boss now, officially.

677
00:53:44,434 --> 00:53:48,063
So you're to give him
your initial findings...

678
00:53:48,105 --> 00:53:50,505
and then follow
his instructions.

679
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:52,702
My deputy will keep me posted.

680
00:53:52,743 --> 00:53:54,643
The colonel's men have checked.

681
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:57,010
Can I see the second culprit?

682
00:53:57,681 --> 00:53:59,842
Whenever you want to.

683
00:53:59,883 --> 00:54:04,252
It seems he was asleep
on the truck, dead drunk...

684
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:07,155
so he's innocent
if it all checks out.

685
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,926
Their whereabouts earlier?

686
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,521
The driver's statement
and photo.

687
00:54:14,164 --> 00:54:17,725
They'd been drinking
at the Chinaman's bar.

688
00:54:17,768 --> 00:54:21,602
We have Chinese tradesmen
in town?

689
00:54:21,638 --> 00:54:24,766
The owner
was in the Korean War...

690
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:26,469
and now he's called
''the Chinaman.''

691
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,239
He backs them up.

692
00:54:28,278 --> 00:54:31,475
I'll read his statement.

693
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:35,850
''I, Bertrand,
alias the Chinaman, et cetera...

694
00:54:35,886 --> 00:54:37,353
''bar owner, et cetera...

695
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:41,517
''do state that
on May 22 of this year...

696
00:54:41,558 --> 00:54:45,289
''Yago and Vago
came into my bar at 7 p.m...

697
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:48,162
''and stayed until 10 p.m.

698
00:54:48,198 --> 00:54:51,224
''They were drinking Pernod.''

699
00:54:52,636 --> 00:54:54,035
It's not allowed, madam.

700
00:55:30,157 --> 00:55:32,682
Three witnesses, a docker.

701
00:55:32,727 --> 00:55:36,891
''I saw Yago and Vago
drinking Pernod all evening.

702
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:40,094
''They left at 10 p.m., drunk.

703
00:55:40,134 --> 00:55:42,796
''The Chinaman said,
'not in the kamikaze!'''

704
00:55:42,837 --> 00:55:44,304
Kamikaze?

705
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:48,468
The pickup truck.
It's Japanese-made.

706
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:51,444
You'd think
we were in the Far East.

707
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,614
I think it's clear.

708
00:55:54,649 --> 00:55:57,641
Though we lack some details
on the culprits...

709
00:55:57,685 --> 00:56:00,677
it's obviously an accident.

710
00:56:00,721 --> 00:56:05,215
I agree.
Besides, the minister phoned...

711
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:06,658
and wants this settled
very quickly...

712
00:56:06,694 --> 00:56:10,255
to cut short
political speculation abroad.

713
00:56:10,298 --> 00:56:15,133
I think the prosecutor
must take a statement...

714
00:56:15,169 --> 00:56:18,366
about the accident today and say
the culprits are caught...

715
00:56:18,406 --> 00:56:23,309
and accused of drunken driving
and assault and battery.

716
00:56:23,344 --> 00:56:25,244
And willful flight.

717
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:26,678
Naturally.

718
00:56:28,282 --> 00:56:30,978
And the man who took him
to the clinic?

719
00:56:32,953 --> 00:56:35,046
It's for you.

720
00:56:42,129 --> 00:56:43,528
He just died.

721
00:56:50,504 --> 00:56:54,133
That doesn't change
the statement.

722
00:56:54,642 --> 00:57:00,672
Instead of ''assault and
battery,'' say ''manslaughter.''

723
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:17,988
Go away, Shoula.

724
00:57:21,435 --> 00:57:23,096
I'll wait for you.

725
00:59:54,488 --> 00:59:55,819
Who are you?

726
00:59:55,856 --> 00:59:59,019
An admirer of your husband--
a reporter.

727
00:59:59,059 --> 01:00:00,287
No photos.

728
01:00:00,327 --> 01:00:03,262
Only a few questions.

729
01:00:03,297 --> 01:00:06,698
The public has a right to know.

730
01:00:11,939 --> 01:00:16,376
Was it an accident or not?

731
01:00:17,077 --> 01:00:20,342
Yesterday, his life
was threatened.

732
01:00:20,381 --> 01:00:21,814
Did you know?

733
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:24,608
You expected it?

734
01:00:24,652 --> 01:00:28,019
You said,
''So they finally did it.''

735
01:00:31,425 --> 01:00:32,824
What did I say?

736
01:00:33,861 --> 01:00:36,989
To the hospital director,
you said...

737
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:39,226
''So they finally did it?''

738
01:00:39,266 --> 01:00:41,200
Who are they?

739
01:00:41,235 --> 01:00:42,759
Go away.

740
01:00:42,803 --> 01:00:44,998
The culprits have been arrested.

741
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:46,836
You thought of them?

742
01:00:48,409 --> 01:00:50,434
Go away.

743
01:01:07,995 --> 01:01:09,792
They know already?

744
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:12,162
Yes, and it's only beginning.

745
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:16,734
Unmask the killers!

746
01:01:54,508 --> 01:01:56,908
The police are accomplices!

747
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:24,337
Wait. I don't understand.

748
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:26,305
The fall didn't kill him?

749
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,898
Not at all.

750
01:02:27,941 --> 01:02:32,503
The skull fracture was due
to a blow struck on the head.

751
01:02:32,546 --> 01:02:34,571
That's our conclusion.

752
01:02:34,615 --> 01:02:38,176
The fall caused minor bruises.

753
01:02:38,218 --> 01:02:39,845
You're sure?

754
01:02:39,887 --> 01:02:41,582
A blow?

755
01:02:41,622 --> 01:02:44,216
You mean by the truck?

756
01:02:44,258 --> 01:02:47,489
The truck hit his body.
It wasn't serious.

757
01:02:47,528 --> 01:02:49,655
The death blow hit his skull...

758
01:02:49,697 --> 01:02:53,133
and was made by an instrument
such as a club...

759
01:02:53,167 --> 01:02:55,260
an iron bar or a gun butt.

760
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:59,530
But no one's mentioned a weapon.

761
01:03:02,276 --> 01:03:03,971
Continue, doctor.

762
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:08,539
The skull fracture
can only be due to a weapon...

763
01:03:08,582 --> 01:03:10,641
that struck from above.

764
01:03:10,684 --> 01:03:12,652
It is the sole condition...

765
01:03:12,686 --> 01:03:14,916
that causes symmetrical lesions
on the brain...

766
01:03:14,955 --> 01:03:17,947
touching the subjacent area...

767
01:03:17,991 --> 01:03:21,154
and the area opposite the wound.

768
01:03:21,195 --> 01:03:23,459
An autopsy showed the lesions...

769
01:03:23,497 --> 01:03:26,227
the right cerebral hemorrhage...

770
01:03:26,266 --> 01:03:30,032
and the fracture
of the left temple.

771
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:32,595
In the case of a shock
due to a fall...

772
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:36,973
on a hard surface
like the street...

773
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,945
such lesions couldn't exist.

774
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:42,278
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

775
01:03:42,316 --> 01:03:44,307
-Sooner?
-Yes. Yesterday.

776
01:03:44,351 --> 01:03:46,683
Mr. Deputy, he was still alive.

777
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,517
We needed an autopsy.

778
01:03:48,555 --> 01:03:51,956
Time for other tests
would have shown the same facts.

779
01:03:51,992 --> 01:03:53,482
Another hypothesis is...

780
01:03:53,527 --> 01:03:55,893
if the truck dragged him...

781
01:03:55,929 --> 01:03:58,261
his skull could have
hit the curb.

782
01:03:58,298 --> 01:04:02,462
It's a fact that he was hit
in the middle of the street.

783
01:04:02,503 --> 01:04:05,995
Then a fall couldn't cause
such lesions.

784
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:07,404
A phone?

785
01:04:07,441 --> 01:04:08,703
Next-door.

786
01:04:10,444 --> 01:04:11,536
Yago was driving.

787
01:04:11,578 --> 01:04:16,277
The second man was drunk and
couldn't have been so precise.

788
01:04:16,316 --> 01:04:18,341
A demonstrator.

789
01:04:18,852 --> 01:04:20,376
Their story's odd.

790
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,717
Know them well?

791
01:04:21,755 --> 01:04:22,949
Very well.

792
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:24,787
Political?

793
01:04:24,825 --> 01:04:26,520
Maybe.

794
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,652
Communists?

795
01:04:27,694 --> 01:04:29,753
Not if they work here.

796
01:04:29,797 --> 01:04:31,594
The opposition?

797
01:04:31,632 --> 01:04:33,463
One never knows.

798
01:04:34,968 --> 01:04:36,629
The general, please.

799
01:04:37,938 --> 01:04:41,533
I wanted to see you
to clarify a few points.

800
01:04:41,575 --> 01:04:44,476
It all seems clear enough to me.

801
01:04:44,511 --> 01:04:46,809
A new fact has come up.

802
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,508
It's stuffy in here.

803
01:04:50,484 --> 01:04:52,975
You saw the accident?

804
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,749
How did it happen?

805
01:04:54,788 --> 01:04:56,653
In what respect?

806
01:04:56,690 --> 01:05:00,751
When the truck arrived,
what happened?

807
01:05:00,794 --> 01:05:03,786
The colonel and I were there...

808
01:05:03,831 --> 01:05:07,267
when he walked out,
waving to the crowd.

809
01:05:07,301 --> 01:05:09,826
They didn't applaud him, either.

810
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:14,967
He didn't see the truck
zigzagging toward him...

811
01:05:15,008 --> 01:05:16,373
and he was hit.

812
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:19,607
The colonel's men
ran after the truck.

813
01:05:19,646 --> 01:05:21,671
Two men drew their guns...

814
01:05:21,715 --> 01:05:24,445
but due to the crowd,
they didn't fire.

815
01:05:24,484 --> 01:05:28,818
The truck zigzagged
and finally got away.

816
01:05:29,389 --> 01:05:32,153
The police cleared the square...

817
01:05:32,192 --> 01:05:35,753
and helped put the victim
into a Volkswagen...

818
01:05:35,796 --> 01:05:37,320
to go to the hospital.

819
01:05:37,364 --> 01:05:39,958
No trace of
the Volkswagen driver?

820
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,993
Not yet, but he must be
a friend of theirs.

821
01:05:44,037 --> 01:05:45,504
He helped them at once.

822
01:05:46,106 --> 01:05:49,234
When the victim was run over...

823
01:05:49,276 --> 01:05:52,040
could his head
have hit the curb?

824
01:05:52,713 --> 01:05:55,204
No. It occurred in the square.

825
01:05:55,249 --> 01:05:56,216
You're sure?

826
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,547
Positive.

827
01:05:57,584 --> 01:06:01,281
But what's this new fact?

828
01:06:02,055 --> 01:06:05,149
The autopsy says
he was killed by a club.

829
01:06:05,192 --> 01:06:06,386
A club?

830
01:06:06,426 --> 01:06:09,361
Why did the doctors
do an autopsy?

831
01:06:09,396 --> 01:06:11,591
It's the legal procedure.

832
01:06:11,632 --> 01:06:13,930
Yesterday, it was all settled.

833
01:06:13,967 --> 01:06:15,594
Now you'll foul us up.

834
01:06:24,444 --> 01:06:27,174
A new witness.

835
01:06:27,214 --> 01:06:30,581
He claims he has proof
the senator was assassinated.

836
01:06:30,617 --> 01:06:33,415
He'll be here today at 2 p.m.

837
01:06:34,755 --> 01:06:37,747
There you are. An assassination.

838
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:41,124
Soon they'll say it was a plot.

839
01:07:18,065 --> 01:07:20,397
I saw him. He was drunk.

840
01:07:20,434 --> 01:07:22,629
He nearly fell
in front of the truck.

841
01:07:28,275 --> 01:07:31,267
What happened? You saw it?

842
01:07:31,311 --> 01:07:33,575
Yes. He slipped and fell.

843
01:07:50,664 --> 01:07:52,188
Anybody here?

844
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:56,469
Anybody here?

845
01:08:46,019 --> 01:08:48,487
I'm the Chief of Police.

846
01:08:49,222 --> 01:08:54,489
I was on my way to testify,
and as I walked along...

847
01:08:54,528 --> 01:08:58,055
You fell and hit your head.

848
01:08:58,098 --> 01:09:00,896
You suffer from epilepsy?

849
01:09:02,536 --> 01:09:04,003
Someone hit me.

850
01:09:04,037 --> 01:09:05,664
I was on my way to testify
that I have proof...

851
01:09:05,705 --> 01:09:08,196
the senator was assassinated.

852
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:10,300
It was no accident.

853
01:09:10,343 --> 01:09:12,038
Yago told me so himself.

854
01:09:12,813 --> 01:09:14,713
I was going to testify...

855
01:09:14,748 --> 01:09:17,148
but someone hit me on the head
from a truck...

856
01:09:17,184 --> 01:09:19,243
with a club...

857
01:09:20,153 --> 01:09:22,519
to keep me quiet.

858
01:09:22,556 --> 01:09:23,818
They tried to kill me.

859
01:09:23,857 --> 01:09:26,018
I don't know who told you
to say this or why.

860
01:09:26,059 --> 01:09:27,083
I don't want to know.

861
01:09:27,127 --> 01:09:31,325
We can forget all this.

862
01:09:31,364 --> 01:09:33,730
Let's say you were influenced.

863
01:09:35,836 --> 01:09:37,963
You're almost one of the family.

864
01:09:38,004 --> 01:09:40,199
Your cousin's a policeman...

865
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,708
brother-in-law
has a government job.

866
01:09:42,742 --> 01:09:44,039
Forget all this.

867
01:09:44,077 --> 01:09:46,045
General, they're coming.

868
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:49,412
If you need anything,
come and see me.

869
01:09:49,449 --> 01:09:51,576
I'll drop by again.

870
01:09:57,057 --> 01:09:59,924
I'm a bachelor
and live with my ma.

871
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,587
Profession?

872
01:10:01,628 --> 01:10:03,357
I have a varnish shop.

873
01:10:03,396 --> 01:10:04,863
You know Yago?

874
01:10:04,898 --> 01:10:05,865
Sure.

875
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:07,423
He makes deliveries for me.

876
01:10:07,467 --> 01:10:09,697
The other two, I don't know.

877
01:10:09,736 --> 01:10:10,703
The killing...

878
01:10:10,737 --> 01:10:11,726
The accident!

879
01:10:13,373 --> 01:10:17,366
Was the day I phoned Yago
about a delivery.

880
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:21,972
Varnished coffins, and I
can't even pay off my kamikaze.

881
01:10:22,015 --> 01:10:23,846
Come back this afternoon.

882
01:10:23,884 --> 01:10:25,511
I'll be busy.

883
01:10:25,552 --> 01:10:26,541
Tonight, then.

884
01:10:26,586 --> 01:10:28,213
I'm busy, too.

885
01:10:29,156 --> 01:10:31,590
I'm gonna make
a real big mistake.

886
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:33,183
It'll be a murder.

887
01:10:33,226 --> 01:10:37,128
Next day, I learned
he'd killed the senator.

888
01:10:37,164 --> 01:10:38,893
Yago told you all that?

889
01:10:38,932 --> 01:10:40,695
You belong to the party?

890
01:10:40,734 --> 01:10:43,498
I never belonged to any party.

891
01:10:43,537 --> 01:10:45,266
I like soccer.

892
01:10:45,305 --> 01:10:46,897
What is this?

893
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,100
The general says I'm epileptic.

894
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:49,108
What general?

895
01:10:49,142 --> 01:10:52,111
The Chief of Police.

896
01:10:52,145 --> 01:10:53,407
He was here?

897
01:10:53,446 --> 01:10:56,609
Just before you came.

898
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:57,844
But I'm no epileptic...

899
01:10:57,884 --> 01:10:59,943
and never belonged to any party.

900
01:11:00,987 --> 01:11:02,648
Go on about Yago.

901
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:06,022
That's all. He left.

902
01:11:06,059 --> 01:11:08,357
He's the lucky one.

903
01:11:09,529 --> 01:11:12,020
What about the delivery?

904
01:11:12,065 --> 01:11:15,796
I tried to set him straight,
but he does as he pleases.

905
01:11:15,835 --> 01:11:19,032
Who told you to call
the inquest judge?

906
01:11:19,072 --> 01:11:20,266
No one.

907
01:11:20,307 --> 01:11:22,605
I see Yago's picture
in the papers...

908
01:11:22,642 --> 01:11:25,873
on the front page,
like a minister.

909
01:11:25,912 --> 01:11:27,243
Jealous?

910
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,872
You made up this tale.

911
01:11:28,915 --> 01:11:31,748
No. Someone advised him.

912
01:11:31,785 --> 01:11:33,946
Even Ma was against it.

913
01:11:33,987 --> 01:11:35,352
She said to keep quiet.

914
01:11:35,388 --> 01:11:37,049
Come and eat.

915
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:38,114
He killed him.

916
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:39,125
Who?

917
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:40,592
A senator.

918
01:11:40,627 --> 01:11:41,821
In the government?

919
01:11:41,861 --> 01:11:43,328
No, a leftist.

920
01:11:43,363 --> 01:11:44,694
He did right.

921
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:46,323
What's it to you?

922
01:11:46,366 --> 01:11:48,197
His picture, too.

923
01:11:49,436 --> 01:11:52,462
Eat and let them
kill each other.

924
01:11:52,505 --> 01:11:53,529
Not hungry.

925
01:11:53,573 --> 01:11:55,165
Later, my sister came.

926
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:58,473
So you want to be a big shot?

927
01:11:58,511 --> 01:12:01,207
Just doing my duty.

928
01:12:01,248 --> 01:12:04,115
Your duty is
to see to your family.

929
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,674
I always have.

930
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:07,619
You have an idiot
who sees to you.

931
01:12:07,654 --> 01:12:09,519
Don't call my husband an idiot.

932
01:12:09,556 --> 01:12:13,617
You think they'll
give you a medal.

933
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:16,128
I came anyway...

934
01:12:16,162 --> 01:12:19,063
or I would have
if they hadn't slugged me.

935
01:12:19,099 --> 01:12:20,691
You didn't fall?

936
01:12:20,734 --> 01:12:25,330
I'd have to be an acrobat
to land on my head.

937
01:12:25,372 --> 01:12:29,001
You can sign a statement later
if you still want to.

938
01:12:29,042 --> 01:12:31,738
Of course. I'm not crazy.

939
01:12:31,778 --> 01:12:34,144
First witness
for the prosecution?

940
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:36,114
They lost no time.

941
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:39,118
Tomorrow, you'll have ten,
maybe fifteen.

942
01:12:39,152 --> 01:12:42,519
They'll say Yago
did this or that...anything.

943
01:12:42,555 --> 01:12:47,049
Vague, worthless statements
that will create unrest.

944
01:12:47,093 --> 01:12:52,725
They sent him and beat him up
to turn a witness into a martyr.

945
01:12:52,766 --> 01:12:55,030
They left him hospitalized...

946
01:12:55,068 --> 01:12:56,933
yet able to talk.

947
01:12:56,970 --> 01:13:00,406
You admit I was beaten
and didn't fall?

948
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,431
You realize what perjury means?

949
01:13:02,475 --> 01:13:04,636
It's not perjury.

950
01:13:04,678 --> 01:13:07,476
I wanted to help,
but if I'd known...

951
01:13:08,982 --> 01:13:11,143
Told you so.

952
01:13:11,184 --> 01:13:13,152
Why did you get involved?

953
01:13:13,186 --> 01:13:15,086
Weren't you all right at home?

954
01:13:17,691 --> 01:13:19,124
Eat.

955
01:13:20,727 --> 01:13:24,424
Suppose you say you slipped
on an orange peel.

956
01:13:24,464 --> 01:13:25,988
I didn't slip.

957
01:13:26,032 --> 01:13:30,992
Why are you so pigheaded?
Listen to me for once.

958
01:13:31,037 --> 01:13:33,164
The first and last time.

959
01:13:33,206 --> 01:13:34,434
Like always.

960
01:13:34,474 --> 01:13:36,635
Really the last time.

961
01:13:36,676 --> 01:13:39,076
Say you slipped,
and we have no problems.

962
01:13:39,112 --> 01:13:41,740
You won't go to prison.

963
01:13:41,781 --> 01:13:44,579
I'll send others to prison.

964
01:13:44,617 --> 01:13:46,414
I got them.

965
01:13:46,453 --> 01:13:49,388
Yago and his picture.

966
01:13:49,422 --> 01:13:52,391
Who sent you--
the cops or your daughter?

967
01:13:53,126 --> 01:13:54,184
Yes, it's me.

968
01:13:54,227 --> 01:13:56,525
You want to ruin my home?

969
01:13:56,563 --> 01:13:58,326
Mama, leave.

970
01:13:58,365 --> 01:13:59,696
Leave us alone.

971
01:14:02,936 --> 01:14:05,336
-Don't argue.
-Go outside!

972
01:14:07,474 --> 01:14:10,204
You hate me because
I've succeeded in life.

973
01:14:10,243 --> 01:14:12,711
You and your husband hate me.

974
01:14:12,746 --> 01:14:14,509
Never mind him !

975
01:14:14,547 --> 01:14:16,777
You've caused him
enough trouble!

976
01:14:16,816 --> 01:14:19,410
You want to ruin my life.

977
01:14:20,553 --> 01:14:23,886
When Papa died, I hoped
you'd take his place.

978
01:14:23,923 --> 01:14:26,824
I needed protection.

979
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:30,193
You neglected me
and never took me anywhere.

980
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:33,791
You preferred soccer
and slobs like Yago.

981
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,266
See what it's got you?

982
01:14:35,301 --> 01:14:40,295
Prison, maybe...for perjury...

983
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:42,069
and my husband
will lose his job.

984
01:14:42,108 --> 01:14:45,202
Come here. Listen.

985
01:14:47,113 --> 01:14:49,445
You hear a guy's
gonna be killed...

986
01:14:49,482 --> 01:14:50,949
you don't believe it.

987
01:14:50,984 --> 01:14:52,815
Then you hear he's dead.

988
01:14:52,852 --> 01:14:54,547
Would you tell the cops?

989
01:14:54,587 --> 01:14:57,988
That's all I did...to help them.

990
01:14:58,024 --> 01:14:59,150
Help who?

991
01:14:59,192 --> 01:15:02,184
To help the cops
find the murderer.

992
01:15:02,228 --> 01:15:04,628
You're helping the others.

993
01:15:06,433 --> 01:15:08,196
What do you want?

994
01:15:08,935 --> 01:15:11,199
Your mother sent me.

995
01:15:11,237 --> 01:15:12,932
I'm a reporter.

996
01:15:12,972 --> 01:15:15,338
I'll tell you
what truly happened...

997
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:17,240
because you print
just everything.

998
01:15:17,277 --> 01:15:18,437
He wasn't hit.

999
01:15:18,478 --> 01:15:24,383
Either he slipped
or felt dizzy and fell...

1000
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:27,614
or else leftists hit him
to create trouble.

1001
01:15:27,654 --> 01:15:29,087
So say the police.

1002
01:15:29,122 --> 01:15:31,454
They say he's crazy
but can't prove it.

1003
01:15:31,491 --> 01:15:32,685
Can you?

1004
01:15:32,725 --> 01:15:33,749
No, I can't.

1005
01:15:33,793 --> 01:15:36,091
Then why try?

1006
01:15:36,129 --> 01:15:39,064
I never said that.

1007
01:15:39,098 --> 01:15:40,793
He's stubborn as a mule.

1008
01:15:40,834 --> 01:15:43,132
He never changes his mind.

1009
01:15:43,169 --> 01:15:47,128
If he doesn't,
the inquest will continue.

1010
01:15:47,173 --> 01:15:51,974
What if he is crazy
and had epilepsy as a baby?

1011
01:15:52,011 --> 01:15:55,970
Tell him you and your husband
are right-wingers...

1012
01:15:56,015 --> 01:15:57,846
and how you got your jobs.

1013
01:15:57,884 --> 01:16:01,047
Yes. I do belong.

1014
01:16:04,657 --> 01:16:05,749
The cop!

1015
01:16:07,727 --> 01:16:08,716
She woke him.

1016
01:16:08,761 --> 01:16:10,422
Sleeping?

1017
01:16:11,197 --> 01:16:12,255
Pictures?

1018
01:16:14,067 --> 01:16:15,557
For the press?

1019
01:16:16,903 --> 01:16:18,268
That's no good.

1020
01:16:18,304 --> 01:16:22,434
But that way people will see
you were slugged...

1021
01:16:22,475 --> 01:16:25,774
to keep you from saying
something important, see?

1022
01:16:25,812 --> 01:16:27,746
They'll beat me again?

1023
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:31,477
They won't dare.
You're famous now.

1024
01:16:31,518 --> 01:16:34,248
But the press
must talk about you.

1025
01:16:34,287 --> 01:16:37,017
Tell me who saw you here--

1026
01:16:37,056 --> 01:16:38,284
your sister, your mother,
the judge.

1027
01:16:38,324 --> 01:16:40,815
The general, he can't stand me.

1028
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:43,658
I wanted to help
and got a cold shoulder.

1029
01:16:43,696 --> 01:16:45,960
They asked if I was a commie.

1030
01:16:45,999 --> 01:16:46,966
Are you?

1031
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,594
No. I only like soccer.

1032
01:16:49,636 --> 01:16:52,901
We'll be on the front page
for a week.

1033
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:05,674
Sorry.

1034
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,509
Who was it?

1035
01:17:08,555 --> 01:17:10,455
I know him.

1036
01:17:31,277 --> 01:17:33,302
And you're a cardiac case?

1037
01:17:33,346 --> 01:17:34,904
No. I...

1038
01:17:36,482 --> 01:17:38,040
It's an old fracture.

1039
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:43,188
Name and profession?

1040
01:17:46,659 --> 01:17:48,251
Any convictions?

1041
01:17:50,563 --> 01:17:52,656
Yes. Four.

1042
01:17:52,699 --> 01:17:53,791
Four?

1043
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:55,323
Yes, four.

1044
01:17:55,368 --> 01:17:56,665
Carrying arms illegally...

1045
01:17:56,703 --> 01:17:57,897
public outrage...

1046
01:17:57,937 --> 01:18:00,770
theft...

1047
01:18:00,807 --> 01:18:02,206
and rape.

1048
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:05,173
Rape?

1049
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:07,771
Not really.

1050
01:18:07,814 --> 01:18:09,509
I was a counselor
at a boy scout camp.

1051
01:18:11,484 --> 01:18:13,452
Why were you in the hospital?

1052
01:18:13,486 --> 01:18:16,944
The head of security
put him there.

1053
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:18,753
My client has a weak heart.

1054
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:20,850
The police doctor certified it.

1055
01:18:20,893 --> 01:18:25,523
I know, but why
the plaster cast...

1056
01:18:25,565 --> 01:18:27,999
and a cane like a club?

1057
01:18:28,034 --> 01:18:31,003
It's because of an old fracture.

1058
01:18:31,037 --> 01:18:34,165
I was broke when it happened.

1059
01:18:34,207 --> 01:18:37,233
I needed x-rays
and ten days in bed.

1060
01:18:37,276 --> 01:18:40,404
Two days of no work,
and I starve.

1061
01:18:40,446 --> 01:18:42,641
It was a rich man's fracture.

1062
01:18:43,349 --> 01:18:48,981
The rich get a cold,
a week in bed.

1063
01:18:49,022 --> 01:18:52,788
For the poor, a fracture means
work or the grave.

1064
01:18:52,825 --> 01:18:56,488
So I had it seen to
while I was in the hospital.

1065
01:18:56,529 --> 01:18:58,360
Where were you that night?

1066
01:18:59,032 --> 01:19:02,331
At the Chinaman's
with Yago till 10:00.

1067
01:19:02,368 --> 01:19:04,029
You see Yago often?

1068
01:19:04,804 --> 01:19:07,500
We're friends and cousins.

1069
01:19:08,374 --> 01:19:09,636
Was he drunk?

1070
01:19:09,676 --> 01:19:12,110
Yago drinks a lot.

1071
01:19:14,347 --> 01:19:17,748
The Chinaman told him
not to take the kamikaze.

1072
01:19:18,451 --> 01:19:20,919
I got in back and fell asleep.

1073
01:19:20,953 --> 01:19:24,548
The shock and the yells woke me.

1074
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:28,754
I thought we were in a ditch,
but we were still going.

1075
01:19:28,795 --> 01:19:32,128
Then a guy leaped
onto the kamikaze...

1076
01:19:32,165 --> 01:19:35,566
as lithe and fierce as a tiger.

1077
01:19:35,601 --> 01:19:39,469
He grabbed me and threw me off
in the street.

1078
01:19:39,505 --> 01:19:41,405
He leaped like...

1079
01:19:41,441 --> 01:19:43,534
-A tiger.
-Before that.

1080
01:19:46,546 --> 01:19:48,480
Lithe and fierce.

1081
01:19:50,483 --> 01:19:52,610
Yago used the same words.

1082
01:19:53,753 --> 01:19:55,778
Yet he didn't see him.

1083
01:19:55,822 --> 01:19:57,983
A simple coincidence.

1084
01:19:58,024 --> 01:20:02,051
They haven't met
since the accident.

1085
01:20:02,095 --> 01:20:03,858
The police can swear to it.

1086
01:20:05,398 --> 01:20:07,161
Continue.

1087
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:12,160
I was in the street
and almost got run over.

1088
01:20:12,205 --> 01:20:13,172
Then?

1089
01:20:13,206 --> 01:20:15,299
I went home.

1090
01:20:15,341 --> 01:20:17,605
Next day,
when I read the papers...

1091
01:20:17,643 --> 01:20:20,669
I went to the cops who put me
in the hospital.

1092
01:20:20,713 --> 01:20:26,652
There he got lost in the halls
and met that reporter...

1093
01:20:26,686 --> 01:20:28,620
by accident.

1094
01:20:28,654 --> 01:20:32,647
That agrees
with the other testimony.

1095
01:20:32,692 --> 01:20:35,957
Yet one phrase makes me wonder.

1096
01:20:36,729 --> 01:20:39,391
It could change
my investigation.

1097
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:41,800
You're a communist.

1098
01:20:43,002 --> 01:20:45,197
You and Yago, too.

1099
01:20:45,238 --> 01:20:48,867
Something you said
makes me think so.

1100
01:20:49,876 --> 01:20:52,310
''The rich get a cold,
a week in bed.

1101
01:20:52,345 --> 01:20:55,280
''For the poor, a fracture means
work or the grave.''

1102
01:20:55,314 --> 01:20:57,805
You gave yourself away.

1103
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,215
I hate the communists!

1104
01:20:59,252 --> 01:21:01,948
Words! I want proof!

1105
01:21:01,988 --> 01:21:04,582
Only a communist
would say such a thing.

1106
01:21:04,624 --> 01:21:07,650
I belong to
an anticommunist group.

1107
01:21:07,693 --> 01:21:09,160
-And Yago?
-Yago, too!

1108
01:21:09,195 --> 01:21:11,186
Which one?

1109
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:12,219
CROC!

1110
01:21:12,265 --> 01:21:14,563
Christian Royalist Organization
against Communism.

1111
01:21:25,111 --> 01:21:26,510
You created a storm.

1112
01:21:27,113 --> 01:21:32,210
Vago was jailed for collusion,
and that means premeditation.

1113
01:21:32,952 --> 01:21:37,116
The judge believed you...

1114
01:21:37,156 --> 01:21:40,421
and found out Vago and Yago
belong to a secret society.

1115
01:21:40,459 --> 01:21:41,585
Secret?

1116
01:21:41,627 --> 01:21:44,687
Yes. The CROC.

1117
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:45,992
Anybody knows that.

1118
01:21:46,032 --> 01:21:49,229
The cops use them
to keep order at parades.

1119
01:21:50,736 --> 01:21:53,466
You've nothing to fear now.

1120
01:21:54,607 --> 01:21:56,837
But in a year,
I'll be forgotten.

1121
01:21:56,876 --> 01:21:58,309
No one can touch you.

1122
01:21:59,145 --> 01:22:03,878
Know anyone who'd show me
CROC members?

1123
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:05,941
I'd pay.

1124
01:22:05,985 --> 01:22:07,077
Sure. It's them.

1125
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:09,019
So help me.

1126
01:22:11,224 --> 01:22:12,919
Know anyone?

1127
01:22:12,959 --> 01:22:14,085
Yes...

1128
01:22:15,361 --> 01:22:18,023
but don't say I told you.

1129
01:22:18,064 --> 01:22:19,463
It's Dumas.

1130
01:22:19,498 --> 01:22:22,023
He was born in Russia.

1131
01:22:22,068 --> 01:22:24,559
CROC has a hold on him...

1132
01:22:24,604 --> 01:22:27,368
because of trouble
with his brother.

1133
01:22:27,406 --> 01:22:30,500
He'd like to get to Germany...

1134
01:22:30,543 --> 01:22:33,444
so if you can get him
a passport...

1135
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:41,309
I can get one
through my newspaper.

1136
01:22:42,188 --> 01:22:44,281
-Pictures?
-Here.

1137
01:22:53,165 --> 01:22:55,497
I've kept my promise.

1138
01:22:55,534 --> 01:22:57,161
Now it's your turn.

1139
01:22:58,437 --> 01:23:00,029
Don't like it?

1140
01:23:00,072 --> 01:23:02,233
Sure.

1141
01:23:03,409 --> 01:23:05,707
The questions?

1142
01:23:06,412 --> 01:23:09,245
Does CROC meet regularly?

1143
01:23:11,484 --> 01:23:12,712
Where?

1144
01:23:13,519 --> 01:23:16,750
At a guy's place
on the edge of town.

1145
01:23:17,456 --> 01:23:19,356
Are there many of you?

1146
01:23:19,392 --> 01:23:20,620
Sometimes.

1147
01:23:21,928 --> 01:23:23,691
What goes on?

1148
01:23:23,729 --> 01:23:25,253
The boss talks.

1149
01:23:25,298 --> 01:23:28,358
Religion and the monarchy...

1150
01:23:28,401 --> 01:23:32,098
are the two pillars
of our eternal land...

1151
01:23:32,138 --> 01:23:35,505
and Western Christian
civilization.

1152
01:23:35,541 --> 01:23:39,534
If you don't listen,
you get no work.

1153
01:23:39,578 --> 01:23:41,136
What else?

1154
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:44,911
In Russia, a worker can't strike
or believe in God...

1155
01:23:44,951 --> 01:23:47,419
or have his own house
and garden.

1156
01:23:47,453 --> 01:23:50,616
He's crushed
by a totalitarian regime.

1157
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,884
You agree?

1158
01:23:51,924 --> 01:23:53,949
I even read it in the papers.

1159
01:23:53,993 --> 01:23:57,292
The individual
belongs to the State.

1160
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:59,764
Yago went to the meetings?

1161
01:23:59,799 --> 01:24:01,323
Always.

1162
01:24:01,367 --> 01:24:02,994
They'd talk about capitalists.

1163
01:24:03,035 --> 01:24:05,595
No more capitalists
or workers...

1164
01:24:05,638 --> 01:24:07,606
or Left or Right.

1165
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:10,336
A unified people
is what we need.

1166
01:24:10,376 --> 01:24:12,276
We need a clean sweep...

1167
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:15,075
starting with
the intellectual scum.

1168
01:24:15,114 --> 01:24:17,207
The bookstore next-door.

1169
01:24:17,249 --> 01:24:21,686
He'd talk about
political youth groups.

1170
01:24:21,721 --> 01:24:24,053
What did he say?

1171
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:26,380
Unite the youth...

1172
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:28,825
And give them a common ideal.

1173
01:24:28,861 --> 01:24:32,524
Abroad, some say,
''Make love, not war.''

1174
01:24:32,565 --> 01:24:38,470
We say, ''Make war on corruption
and on liberalism...

1175
01:24:38,504 --> 01:24:41,496
''and on indiscriminate liberty.''

1176
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:44,907
I say, ''OK,''
but I don't give a damn.

1177
01:24:44,944 --> 01:24:46,172
And Yago?

1178
01:24:46,212 --> 01:24:50,114
He agrees because he wants
to pay off his kamikaze.

1179
01:24:50,149 --> 01:24:52,379
Now he'll be able to easy.

1180
01:24:53,285 --> 01:24:55,014
He killed the senator?

1181
01:24:55,054 --> 01:24:58,217
You said no accusations.

1182
01:24:58,257 --> 01:25:00,020
No. I'm paying.

1183
01:25:00,059 --> 01:25:01,720
Never.

1184
01:25:01,761 --> 01:25:05,060
But you can point them out to me
for some photos.

1185
01:25:05,097 --> 01:25:07,031
That's what you wanted?

1186
01:25:08,167 --> 01:25:10,692
The three on the pickup.

1187
01:25:12,104 --> 01:25:15,437
The butcher's involved.

1188
01:25:16,342 --> 01:25:20,142
The fat guy owns the bar
where we meet.

1189
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,643
The barber.

1190
01:25:23,349 --> 01:25:25,579
The mechanic...

1191
01:25:25,618 --> 01:25:27,984
and the two in black.

1192
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,112
In khaki.

1193
01:25:29,155 --> 01:25:30,884
Him?

1194
01:25:30,923 --> 01:25:34,290
An ex-boxer who lived
in the U.S. awhile.

1195
01:25:34,326 --> 01:25:36,385
In the yard, the boss...

1196
01:25:36,429 --> 01:25:39,159
an officer
during the German occupation.

1197
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:41,462
The fig seller, a loudmouth...

1198
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:44,333
always up in front
for the rough stuff.

1199
01:25:56,782 --> 01:25:58,477
Some figs, please.

1200
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:07,154
Pictures, eh?

1201
01:26:07,193 --> 01:26:11,357
He sells his blood
and gets a good price

1202
01:26:11,397 --> 01:26:14,161
in case of emergencies.

1203
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,795
He got rich selling
one of his eyes to an American.

1204
01:26:17,837 --> 01:26:20,635
He doesn't
attend meetings anymore.

1205
01:26:20,673 --> 01:26:23,039
His sight is bad,
so he sells blood.

1206
01:26:24,477 --> 01:26:25,808
Not him?

1207
01:26:26,979 --> 01:26:29,470
Them?

1208
01:26:29,515 --> 01:26:30,539
Him?

1209
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,112
No?

1210
01:26:36,155 --> 01:26:39,022
It looks like him.

1211
01:26:39,058 --> 01:26:40,719
He hit me twice...

1212
01:26:40,759 --> 01:26:42,488
even in the ambulance.

1213
01:26:42,528 --> 01:26:45,053
Write that in the margin.

1214
01:26:45,097 --> 01:26:47,930
Publish it in your paper.

1215
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:50,828
Sign the caption.

1216
01:26:52,538 --> 01:26:53,732
Publish it.

1217
01:26:53,772 --> 01:26:55,467
Yes, but not in your paper.

1218
01:26:55,508 --> 01:26:57,305
In a big daily paper...

1219
01:26:57,343 --> 01:26:59,038
for more readers and money.

1220
01:26:59,078 --> 01:27:00,807
Money.

1221
01:27:00,846 --> 01:27:02,473
In my paper tomorrow.

1222
01:27:02,515 --> 01:27:05,245
I'll give the inquest judge
my photos.

1223
01:27:06,452 --> 01:27:09,580
Don't you want to be efficient?

1224
01:27:09,622 --> 01:27:12,921
In a local leftist paper,
no one will see it.

1225
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:15,984
In mine, it's sensational news.

1226
01:27:18,197 --> 01:27:21,223
You recognized me?

1227
01:27:21,267 --> 01:27:22,632
You dishonored me.

1228
01:27:22,668 --> 01:27:25,501
You made me out
to be a gangster.

1229
01:27:25,538 --> 01:27:28,405
I wasn't at that demonstration.

1230
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:32,240
I have nothing to do
with politics.

1231
01:27:32,278 --> 01:27:34,178
Let him be.

1232
01:27:35,447 --> 01:27:36,675
Leave.

1233
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:43,188
I'm the judge.

1234
01:27:45,424 --> 01:27:46,413
Explain.

1235
01:27:46,458 --> 01:27:49,291
I'm on the front page.

1236
01:27:49,328 --> 01:27:53,958
Mr. Pirou says I hit him
at the demonstration.

1237
01:27:53,999 --> 01:27:56,763
I wasn't there.
I have witnesses.

1238
01:27:56,802 --> 01:28:00,260
Politics are a lot of crap.

1239
01:28:00,306 --> 01:28:02,638
I was at the market
with my figs.

1240
01:28:02,675 --> 01:28:05,735
Your picture's in what paper?

1241
01:28:06,579 --> 01:28:09,412
I forget.

1242
01:28:09,448 --> 01:28:11,848
It arrives from the capital
at 10:00.

1243
01:28:13,352 --> 01:28:15,286
I can't read very well.

1244
01:28:15,321 --> 01:28:22,124
The news vendor showed it to me
and read it to me.

1245
01:28:22,628 --> 01:28:25,995
At the market,
they think I'm a hoodlum.

1246
01:28:26,031 --> 01:28:28,056
I wanted an explanation...

1247
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:29,260
man to man.

1248
01:28:29,301 --> 01:28:31,462
From the capital?

1249
01:28:31,503 --> 01:28:32,902
Still recognize me?

1250
01:28:32,938 --> 01:28:35,429
I said, what paper?

1251
01:28:38,244 --> 01:28:41,805
The papers that arrive
from the capital at 10:00.

1252
01:28:41,847 --> 01:28:43,610
This morning, they didn't.

1253
01:28:43,649 --> 01:28:46,447
The mail plane was fogged in.

1254
01:28:47,052 --> 01:28:49,145
Who told you to say all this?

1255
01:29:04,069 --> 01:29:05,195
Yes.

1256
01:29:06,772 --> 01:29:09,832
I hit him.
I hit him.

1257
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,207
But I had to.

1258
01:29:13,245 --> 01:29:15,372
Somebody forced me to.

1259
01:29:15,414 --> 01:29:17,473
Who? His name?

1260
01:29:19,151 --> 01:29:21,312
I can't tell you.

1261
01:29:21,353 --> 01:29:23,014
He's too big...

1262
01:29:24,356 --> 01:29:26,449
too important.

1263
01:29:26,492 --> 01:29:27,652
I can't.

1264
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:29,659
He told me about it.

1265
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:35,266
Barone, your picture's
in one of the capital's papers.

1266
01:29:35,301 --> 01:29:36,461
Mine?

1267
01:29:36,502 --> 01:29:37,969
One that arrives at 10:00!

1268
01:29:38,003 --> 01:29:40,597
So at 10:45...

1269
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:42,698
you go see Pirou
at the hospital.

1270
01:29:42,741 --> 01:29:43,708
Raise hell.

1271
01:29:43,742 --> 01:29:48,270
Say you're innocent.
Scream and shout.

1272
01:29:48,314 --> 01:29:51,579
Reporters will be there.
Now tell me again.

1273
01:29:51,617 --> 01:29:53,676
I rush to the hospital--

1274
01:29:53,719 --> 01:29:54,708
Get out of here!

1275
01:29:55,254 --> 01:29:56,516
To see Pirou.

1276
01:29:56,555 --> 01:29:58,580
But tell me his name.

1277
01:29:58,624 --> 01:30:00,683
I can't. He's too big.

1278
01:30:00,726 --> 01:30:04,287
All right. Follow me, please.

1279
01:30:09,068 --> 01:30:12,504
I'm innocent.
I only wanted to testify.

1280
01:30:13,072 --> 01:30:15,506
It's all left-wing politics.

1281
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:19,602
This important man...

1282
01:30:19,645 --> 01:30:20,839
he helped you?

1283
01:30:20,879 --> 01:30:24,042
Yes, in my work
and for my birds.

1284
01:30:24,083 --> 01:30:28,850
They wake the neighbors.
I was gonna have to move.

1285
01:30:28,887 --> 01:30:32,618
But my birds are pretty.
You should see them, Judge.

1286
01:30:33,726 --> 01:30:36,718
He helped me in my work, too--

1287
01:30:36,762 --> 01:30:39,697
the market permit and all that.

1288
01:30:39,732 --> 01:30:43,759
The day of the accident,
you saw him?

1289
01:30:43,802 --> 01:30:48,000
Yes. Jimmy said,
''The boss is downstairs.''

1290
01:30:48,607 --> 01:30:50,097
He was in the car.

1291
01:30:50,142 --> 01:30:51,302
Get in!

1292
01:30:56,248 --> 01:30:57,715
You know it's tonight?

1293
01:30:58,417 --> 01:30:59,907
Impossible.

1294
01:30:59,952 --> 01:31:03,149
I got some figs due in.

1295
01:31:03,188 --> 01:31:04,780
They got to be uncrated.

1296
01:31:04,823 --> 01:31:09,317
To sell them, you need a stand?

1297
01:31:09,361 --> 01:31:10,453
I got one.

1298
01:31:10,496 --> 01:31:12,589
And you need a permit?

1299
01:31:12,631 --> 01:31:13,996
I got one.

1300
01:31:14,032 --> 01:31:16,466
But for how much longer?

1301
01:31:16,969 --> 01:31:17,936
Six months.

1302
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:20,495
And who renews permits?

1303
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:22,666
He does?

1304
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:24,300
Yes.

1305
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:27,437
Then he dropped us off.

1306
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:31,381
Do a good job tonight.
I'm counting on you.

1307
01:31:31,417 --> 01:31:33,408
You'll get a permanent permit...

1308
01:31:33,452 --> 01:31:37,718
and maybe a new house
for your birds.

1309
01:31:38,957 --> 01:31:41,755
I said, ''Colonel,
I'll do my best.''

1310
01:31:43,529 --> 01:31:45,087
The police colonel?

1311
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:48,359
Yes.

1312
01:31:50,369 --> 01:31:52,963
Let's start at the beginning.

1313
01:31:55,808 --> 01:31:57,639
Can you come in, Deputy?

1314
01:31:59,478 --> 01:32:02,970
Prolonging the inquest...

1315
01:32:03,015 --> 01:32:06,678
gives the opposition fuel
for subversive action.

1316
01:32:06,718 --> 01:32:08,208
You've sided with them?

1317
01:32:08,253 --> 01:32:09,220
It's not a prolongation.

1318
01:32:09,254 --> 01:32:11,688
It's a totally new case.

1319
01:32:12,391 --> 01:32:16,828
Some points are awkward,
but the case is clear.

1320
01:32:16,862 --> 01:32:21,526
On the contrary, we began with
an accident and two drunks.

1321
01:32:21,567 --> 01:32:22,966
Some ice, dear.

1322
01:32:24,536 --> 01:32:27,801
Their testimony
coincides in detail.

1323
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,536
Confirmed by the Chinaman.

1324
01:32:31,243 --> 01:32:35,942
Next day, the autopsy says death
was due to a blow by a club.

1325
01:32:35,981 --> 01:32:37,972
A second autopsy will say no...

1326
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:42,817
and a confirmation will disprove
the initial autopsy.

1327
01:32:42,855 --> 01:32:46,052
I'd had no time to examine
this new theory...

1328
01:32:46,091 --> 01:32:49,720
when a witness said
it was an assassination.

1329
01:32:49,761 --> 01:32:51,820
Based on a vague discussion.

1330
01:32:53,332 --> 01:32:56,961
On his way to see me,
the witness was clubbed...

1331
01:32:57,002 --> 01:32:58,629
and he's still in the hospital.

1332
01:32:58,670 --> 01:33:00,001
What do you mean?

1333
01:33:00,038 --> 01:33:02,529
I'm only stating facts.

1334
01:33:04,209 --> 01:33:06,006
Then comes the reporter.

1335
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:09,275
He's not a militant,
and that's important.

1336
01:33:09,314 --> 01:33:14,980
I learned Yago and Vago
belong to CROC--

1337
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:17,079
the Christian Royalist.

1338
01:33:17,122 --> 01:33:19,022
I know.

1339
01:33:19,057 --> 01:33:22,618
Along with the assailant
of the second senator...

1340
01:33:22,661 --> 01:33:24,322
and most of those
at the demonstration.

1341
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:28,593
It seems the police know
and use them as auxiliaries...

1342
01:33:28,634 --> 01:33:31,865
to maintain order
for state visits.

1343
01:33:31,904 --> 01:33:32,962
That's yet to be proven.

1344
01:33:33,805 --> 01:33:36,706
Like the fact that
the police colonel...

1345
01:33:36,742 --> 01:33:39,939
drove this man
to the demonstration.

1346
01:33:39,978 --> 01:33:43,846
Really! He wouldn't be
involved with such a person!

1347
01:33:43,882 --> 01:33:47,818
Not openly. No one
will believe it.

1348
01:33:49,121 --> 01:33:50,782
My conclusion is this:

1349
01:33:51,823 --> 01:33:56,021
As a case of drunken driving,
it's simple...

1350
01:33:56,061 --> 01:33:58,291
but impossible.

1351
01:33:58,330 --> 01:34:04,030
If we accept the premeditated
act of a group...

1352
01:34:04,069 --> 01:34:07,232
aided or simply abetted
by the police...

1353
01:34:07,272 --> 01:34:09,297
it all becomes clear,
fits together.

1354
01:34:10,108 --> 01:34:13,874
This is serious.
I must phone the minister.

1355
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:18,015
I favor the accident theory...

1356
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:23,150
premeditated, if you wish,
by two drunken fanatics.

1357
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:26,481
Yes, you don't smoke.

1358
01:34:27,426 --> 01:34:29,917
You must settle this quickly.

1359
01:34:31,229 --> 01:34:36,565
The country, the whole world,
is watching and waiting.

1360
01:34:36,602 --> 01:34:38,934
Our country's honor is at stake.

1361
01:34:40,205 --> 01:34:42,139
Don't bother with these fools.

1362
01:34:42,741 --> 01:34:45,039
Your future lies before you.

1363
01:34:45,077 --> 01:34:50,344
This case can either make
or break your career.

1364
01:34:51,516 --> 01:34:53,245
Trust in my experience.

1365
01:34:56,488 --> 01:34:59,457
My group is authorized
by the state.

1366
01:34:59,491 --> 01:35:04,690
We are honest citizens,
healthy elements of society...

1367
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:08,029
antibodies in the fight
against infection.

1368
01:35:08,066 --> 01:35:12,196
We want to protect Western
Christian civilization...

1369
01:35:12,237 --> 01:35:14,865
but it is a moral struggle.

1370
01:35:14,906 --> 01:35:20,970
No members of my group
were at the demonstration.

1371
01:35:21,013 --> 01:35:22,640
Where were you that night?

1372
01:35:22,681 --> 01:35:26,708
I was at the Dockers' Union.

1373
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:29,578
Alibi confirmed.

1374
01:35:30,922 --> 01:35:34,483
I was playing cards
with my dentist.

1375
01:35:34,526 --> 01:35:35,925
Confirmed.

1376
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:39,761
I'm a baker. I slept
till midnight at my shop.

1377
01:35:39,798 --> 01:35:41,425
Alibi confirmed.

1378
01:35:41,466 --> 01:35:43,696
I was at the Chinaman's.

1379
01:35:44,369 --> 01:35:45,393
Confirmed.

1380
01:35:45,437 --> 01:35:46,631
At the Chinaman's.

1381
01:35:46,672 --> 01:35:48,071
Confirmed.

1382
01:35:48,106 --> 01:35:52,668
I played cards with my dentist.

1383
01:35:52,711 --> 01:35:54,042
Confirmed.

1384
01:35:54,079 --> 01:35:57,480
That's not you?

1385
01:35:57,516 --> 01:36:00,383
It does look like me.

1386
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:03,053
Indicted for perjury...

1387
01:36:03,789 --> 01:36:06,656
along with those who
confirmed his alibi.

1388
01:36:06,692 --> 01:36:08,717
Plus obstructing justice.

1389
01:36:09,394 --> 01:36:10,588
Take him away.

1390
01:36:13,331 --> 01:36:16,198
Witness 27 has died
of a heart attack.

1391
01:36:16,234 --> 01:36:18,794
He owned the CROC meeting hall.

1392
01:36:18,837 --> 01:36:22,432
Earlier you stated Yago
hit you with a club...

1393
01:36:22,474 --> 01:36:24,442
like a police billy club.

1394
01:36:24,476 --> 01:36:26,410
Do you maintain that?

1395
01:36:26,445 --> 01:36:27,412
Yes, Judge.

1396
01:36:27,446 --> 01:36:30,244
The Attorney General
says he phoned you...

1397
01:36:30,282 --> 01:36:34,048
that the senator's life
had been threatened.

1398
01:36:34,086 --> 01:36:37,112
Your superiors never
got his message.

1399
01:36:37,155 --> 01:36:39,089
Yes. I forgot to tell them.

1400
01:36:39,124 --> 01:36:40,489
That's a serious error.

1401
01:36:40,525 --> 01:36:45,622
I'll answer to my superiors,
not to you, Judge.

1402
01:36:47,432 --> 01:36:52,199
That morning, you were
warned of death threats...

1403
01:36:52,237 --> 01:36:54,205
against the senator.

1404
01:36:55,073 --> 01:36:56,938
Who told you about them?

1405
01:36:57,809 --> 01:37:01,802
A colleague's wife.
She can't tell us the name.

1406
01:37:01,847 --> 01:37:03,314
She'll have to.

1407
01:37:03,348 --> 01:37:08,376
The man says I can tell you.
He's waiting in the hall.

1408
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:09,717
Bring him in.

1409
01:37:10,856 --> 01:37:12,653
His name's Coste.

1410
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:16,784
-The day--
-Of the incident.

1411
01:37:17,796 --> 01:37:21,857
He came to my office
to tell me of a conversation.

1412
01:37:23,235 --> 01:37:24,998
But he'll tell it to you better.

1413
01:37:25,871 --> 01:37:30,240
Don't mention me in the papers,
not my name.

1414
01:37:30,275 --> 01:37:32,709
Why? Isn't your story true?

1415
01:37:32,744 --> 01:37:34,803
Yes, but I want no trouble.

1416
01:37:34,846 --> 01:37:36,780
If you do, come see me.

1417
01:37:38,350 --> 01:37:40,511
Wait in the hall, please.

1418
01:37:43,655 --> 01:37:45,816
Name and profession?

1419
01:37:46,324 --> 01:37:48,952
Ilya Coste, delivery man.

1420
01:37:50,462 --> 01:37:51,861
On the day of
the assassination--

1421
01:37:51,897 --> 01:37:53,057
Day of the incident.

1422
01:37:53,765 --> 01:37:56,199
An assassination's
not yet proven.

1423
01:37:57,502 --> 01:38:01,199
The day of the incident
was rainy.

1424
01:38:01,239 --> 01:38:04,697
I work myself to death...

1425
01:38:05,243 --> 01:38:09,577
and the bank gets half
of what I earn.

1426
01:38:09,614 --> 01:38:11,377
Someone for you!

1427
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:13,378
Again.

1428
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:19,950
Which one?

1429
01:38:21,026 --> 01:38:22,618
That one.

1430
01:38:22,661 --> 01:38:23,923
Go on.

1431
01:38:23,962 --> 01:38:25,224
I heard Yago say...

1432
01:38:25,263 --> 01:38:26,753
-If it rains?
-So?

1433
01:38:26,798 --> 01:38:29,096
-We'll skid.
-It won't.

1434
01:38:29,134 --> 01:38:31,534
It won't rain,
but I got payments due.

1435
01:38:31,570 --> 01:38:32,662
We'll cover you.

1436
01:38:33,271 --> 01:38:34,431
All the payments?

1437
01:38:34,472 --> 01:38:37,999
The varnisher phoned!

1438
01:38:38,043 --> 01:38:41,535
He wants you this afternoon
to deliver some coffins!

1439
01:38:43,014 --> 01:38:45,209
It's a good sign.
See you tonight.

1440
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:49,950
Then he came over.

1441
01:38:51,957 --> 01:38:54,050
I'll buy you a drink.

1442
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:57,124
As he sat down, I saw the club.

1443
01:38:57,162 --> 01:38:58,459
What's that for?

1444
01:38:59,264 --> 01:39:03,030
Tonight. A delivery job
that'll take care of a lot.

1445
01:39:03,068 --> 01:39:04,535
What kind?

1446
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:07,638
A delivery into hell.

1447
01:39:07,672 --> 01:39:08,934
A senator from the capital.

1448
01:39:09,474 --> 01:39:10,964
A dirty job.

1449
01:39:11,009 --> 01:39:12,476
No one knows.

1450
01:39:13,044 --> 01:39:15,035
If they do, it'll be you.

1451
01:39:19,384 --> 01:39:22,182
Later, the same man came back.

1452
01:39:45,777 --> 01:39:47,836
He's different in civvies.

1453
01:39:47,879 --> 01:39:49,403
You knew him?

1454
01:39:49,447 --> 01:39:51,881
I'd asked for a truck permit.

1455
01:39:51,917 --> 01:39:54,909
Every six months,
I went to him about it.

1456
01:39:54,953 --> 01:39:56,978
He was always in uniform.

1457
01:40:01,126 --> 01:40:02,423
But why pick Yago?

1458
01:40:03,261 --> 01:40:05,923
He's the best driver in town.

1459
01:40:05,964 --> 01:40:10,333
You should see him
with his kamikaze.

1460
01:40:12,437 --> 01:40:15,429
He has a political record.

1461
01:40:15,473 --> 01:40:18,874
He was in the Communist
underground in the war...

1462
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:21,037
then deported to the islands.

1463
01:40:21,079 --> 01:40:22,239
His testimony.

1464
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:25,738
Is suspect, of course.
I wouldn't use it.

1465
01:41:39,524 --> 01:41:40,855
Never mind.

1466
01:41:41,359 --> 01:41:44,294
They want to eliminate
all troublesome witnesses.

1467
01:41:45,063 --> 01:41:48,157
They just tried to get me.

1468
01:41:48,199 --> 01:41:52,033
-What?
-Attempted murder, just now.

1469
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:55,631
The plot continues
and will continue!

1470
01:41:55,673 --> 01:41:58,107
I don't need your advice.

1471
01:41:58,143 --> 01:42:01,078
This involves the top brass.

1472
01:42:01,112 --> 01:42:02,101
The police are their toys.

1473
01:42:02,147 --> 01:42:04,638
And cops haven't the capacity...

1474
01:42:04,682 --> 01:42:08,675
to commit such a murder
without being protected.

1475
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:11,314
The guilty ones
are in the government...

1476
01:42:11,356 --> 01:42:13,256
or at the palace...

1477
01:42:13,291 --> 01:42:16,783
where the general
is head of the guards.

1478
01:42:16,828 --> 01:42:19,922
And the palace takes orders
from abroad.

1479
01:42:19,964 --> 01:42:22,194
One more word and...

1480
01:42:22,233 --> 01:42:25,600
I'll charge you with
defamation of the state.

1481
01:42:26,838 --> 01:42:31,172
This isn't a rally.
What happened?

1482
01:42:31,209 --> 01:42:33,234
They tried to kill me.

1483
01:42:33,278 --> 01:42:35,678
They knew I had
important info for you.

1484
01:42:35,713 --> 01:42:39,114
So a car tried to run me down
on my way here.

1485
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:40,583
Any witnesses?

1486
01:42:40,618 --> 01:42:43,985
Here are three honest,
God-fearing housewives...

1487
01:42:44,022 --> 01:42:46,047
who'll testify, plus...

1488
01:42:46,091 --> 01:42:48,992
a park guard, a war vet
with medals.

1489
01:42:49,627 --> 01:42:51,561
What's this information?

1490
01:42:52,063 --> 01:42:55,032
The police own the Volkswagen.

1491
01:42:56,601 --> 01:42:58,364
That took him away
to the hospital?

1492
01:42:59,104 --> 01:43:03,370
But no cops were allowed
in the car to finish him off...

1493
01:43:03,408 --> 01:43:05,706
so the driver took
the longest route.

1494
01:43:05,743 --> 01:43:07,108
I know. I was there.

1495
01:43:07,145 --> 01:43:10,911
But the car belongs
to one of your friends.

1496
01:43:10,949 --> 01:43:15,079
He must be a friend.
He helped them at once.

1497
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:18,214
Who told you such a tale?

1498
01:43:18,256 --> 01:43:22,420
The car disappeared.
No trace of it at the hospital.

1499
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:24,826
The page was torn
out of the registry.

1500
01:43:24,863 --> 01:43:26,490
Don't you find that odd?

1501
01:43:29,234 --> 01:43:32,203
I think you did it
to add grist to your mill.

1502
01:43:33,538 --> 01:43:34,766
Is this the car?

1503
01:43:35,373 --> 01:43:36,806
Yes.

1504
01:43:36,841 --> 01:43:39,207
Find the owner of this car.

1505
01:43:41,346 --> 01:43:42,904
If you wish to wash.

1506
01:43:43,481 --> 01:43:45,608
Thanks. I'm all right.

1507
01:43:49,621 --> 01:43:50,986
Tell me what you know.

1508
01:43:51,689 --> 01:43:56,149
But I warn you, you risk
indictment for perjury.

1509
01:43:56,194 --> 01:43:57,218
Go ahead.

1510
01:43:57,795 --> 01:44:02,129
The car was waiting there,
hidden by the police.

1511
01:44:02,167 --> 01:44:04,635
And when the truck came?

1512
01:44:04,669 --> 01:44:06,933
It pulled up.

1513
01:44:06,971 --> 01:44:08,529
Inspector!

1514
01:44:11,876 --> 01:44:14,037
Chief!

1515
01:44:14,078 --> 01:44:17,673
He wanted the general
to clear the square.

1516
01:44:18,383 --> 01:44:19,850
Come on.

1517
01:44:26,224 --> 01:44:28,488
What are you waiting for?

1518
01:44:29,561 --> 01:44:31,153
I saw the truck arrive.

1519
01:44:31,196 --> 01:44:32,163
Watch out!

1520
01:44:32,197 --> 01:44:36,896
The man in back was standing up?
Did he hit him?

1521
01:44:36,935 --> 01:44:39,699
I don't know.
It happened too fast.

1522
01:44:39,737 --> 01:44:44,106
-And then?
-He fell to his knees.

1523
01:44:44,142 --> 01:44:45,666
His knees?

1524
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:47,701
His head hit the pavement?

1525
01:44:47,745 --> 01:44:53,581
No. He was on his knees,
surrounded by the demonstrators.

1526
01:44:53,618 --> 01:44:55,313
The police did nothing.

1527
01:44:55,353 --> 01:44:57,981
Which demonstrators?

1528
01:44:58,022 --> 01:45:00,013
Impossible to say.

1529
01:45:01,926 --> 01:45:06,124
We pulled him free.
Then he collapsed.

1530
01:45:11,402 --> 01:45:14,735
A Volkswagen arrived;
from where, I don't know.

1531
01:45:22,981 --> 01:45:27,850
Finally the cops intervened
and tried to get into the car.

1532
01:45:34,425 --> 01:45:36,985
Come on!

1533
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:43,963
Get to the hospital!

1534
01:45:47,338 --> 01:45:49,272
Get going!

1535
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:55,702
Faster! Honk your horn!

1536
01:45:55,747 --> 01:45:57,681
Is it broken?

1537
01:45:58,716 --> 01:46:00,240
Turn right!

1538
01:46:00,285 --> 01:46:02,617
This way avoids traffic.

1539
01:46:03,288 --> 01:46:08,817
He did it to waste time.
Then he hit another car.

1540
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:10,953
Keep going!

1541
01:46:10,995 --> 01:46:13,520
I need a damage report!

1542
01:46:14,465 --> 01:46:19,368
A man's hurt.
It's a matter of life and death.

1543
01:46:19,404 --> 01:46:20,962
OK. Go on.

1544
01:46:28,446 --> 01:46:30,175
He did it on purpose.

1545
01:46:30,214 --> 01:46:33,775
And the cops would have
killed him in the car.

1546
01:46:33,818 --> 01:46:35,649
On purpose?

1547
01:46:35,687 --> 01:46:41,785
I did my best. They were upset.
I can understand that.

1548
01:46:41,826 --> 01:46:43,623
No one noticed me
at the hospital.

1549
01:46:44,562 --> 01:46:49,465
I'd rented the car
for an afternoon date...

1550
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,991
and was on my way home.

1551
01:46:52,036 --> 01:46:54,197
Roadblocks were up.

1552
01:46:54,238 --> 01:46:57,867
I must not have
noticed the police.

1553
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:03,779
At the hospital, I washed
the seats of the blood.

1554
01:47:03,815 --> 01:47:07,012
You said,
''I'm a part-time chauffeur.''

1555
01:47:07,552 --> 01:47:10,112
But you're a serviceman.

1556
01:47:10,154 --> 01:47:12,054
I'm doing my military service.

1557
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:13,114
What branch?

1558
01:47:13,157 --> 01:47:15,921
As a policeman.

1559
01:47:20,231 --> 01:47:22,722
You're a police chauffeur.

1560
01:47:25,236 --> 01:47:26,396
What section?

1561
01:47:27,405 --> 01:47:29,430
One close to the general.

1562
01:47:29,474 --> 01:47:30,964
How close?

1563
01:47:31,008 --> 01:47:32,532
Personal.

1564
01:47:32,577 --> 01:47:33,635
Since when?

1565
01:47:34,645 --> 01:47:35,805
One year.

1566
01:47:35,847 --> 01:47:38,714
The general's driver
for one year.

1567
01:47:38,750 --> 01:47:43,653
You were all at the scene
of the murder by accident.

1568
01:47:43,688 --> 01:47:45,747
Shall I write ''murder''?

1569
01:47:45,790 --> 01:47:47,223
You said ''murder.''

1570
01:48:03,441 --> 01:48:06,274
Do you know who has arrived?

1571
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:08,278
The National Attorney General.

1572
01:48:08,312 --> 01:48:10,075
Leave us alone.

1573
01:48:11,215 --> 01:48:15,311
The National Attorney General
has come to talk to you...

1574
01:48:15,353 --> 01:48:17,116
in secret.

1575
01:48:20,091 --> 01:48:21,251
Yes, he's here.

1576
01:48:21,926 --> 01:48:23,757
I'll bring my files at once.

1577
01:48:33,104 --> 01:48:35,402
So it's you. Sit down.

1578
01:48:39,477 --> 01:48:43,436
You're ready to indict
the chief of police?

1579
01:48:43,481 --> 01:48:44,607
It's inevitable.

1580
01:48:44,649 --> 01:48:47,709
My friend, only Divine Will
is inevitable.

1581
01:48:47,752 --> 01:48:50,050
Proof is overwhelming, sir.

1582
01:48:50,087 --> 01:48:52,419
Proof? Hearsay!

1583
01:48:52,457 --> 01:48:56,325
So-called proof
by so-called pacifists...

1584
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:58,794
who want to create a hero.

1585
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:02,596
That's certain, sir,
but police complicity...

1586
01:49:02,633 --> 01:49:04,999
with the demonstrators
is certain.

1587
01:49:05,603 --> 01:49:10,131
Those two men circled in red
are plainclothes men.

1588
01:49:10,174 --> 01:49:13,735
They admit being
in the demonstration.

1589
01:49:13,778 --> 01:49:17,509
We also know the police chief
met Yago that day...

1590
01:49:17,548 --> 01:49:19,516
plus other demonstrators.

1591
01:49:19,550 --> 01:49:23,646
The general said he didn't
know the driver of the VW...

1592
01:49:23,688 --> 01:49:27,146
but he's the general's
personal chauffeur.

1593
01:49:28,526 --> 01:49:31,495
I won't mention
the police's passiveness.

1594
01:49:31,529 --> 01:49:34,430
Then comes the intimidation
of witnesses.

1595
01:49:35,032 --> 01:49:40,163
Vago is hospitalized with
a police medical certificate.

1596
01:49:40,204 --> 01:49:44,436
He's found near the room
of a major witness, with a club.

1597
01:49:45,343 --> 01:49:49,575
Then there's Yago's club
during the demonstration.

1598
01:49:49,614 --> 01:49:50,911
Several witnesses saw it.

1599
01:49:51,415 --> 01:49:55,442
It disappeared
when he was arrested...

1600
01:49:55,486 --> 01:49:58,546
but the agent admitted
rewriting his report.

1601
01:49:58,589 --> 01:50:01,581
You shouldn't mention
the club in your report.

1602
01:50:01,626 --> 01:50:02,820
But it's done, sir.

1603
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:05,351
I'm the police chief general.

1604
01:50:06,931 --> 01:50:08,296
At ease.

1605
01:50:09,066 --> 01:50:12,695
Don't worry.
You did your duty.

1606
01:50:12,737 --> 01:50:15,137
You've been a policeman
how long?

1607
01:50:15,172 --> 01:50:16,662
Six years.

1608
01:50:16,707 --> 01:50:20,541
Just rewrite your report.

1609
01:50:20,578 --> 01:50:22,808
The Attorney General.

1610
01:50:22,847 --> 01:50:26,146
And then you arrived, sir.

1611
01:50:27,084 --> 01:50:29,518
He couldn't lie.
On the contrary.

1612
01:50:29,554 --> 01:50:31,954
His confession
will cost him a lot.

1613
01:50:32,557 --> 01:50:35,321
There is a case
for indictment...

1614
01:50:35,359 --> 01:50:37,827
but not enough for a jury
to condemn the police.

1615
01:50:37,862 --> 01:50:40,660
The jury will do its duty.
I've done mine.

1616
01:50:40,698 --> 01:50:44,361
You'll discredit the police
and the court...

1617
01:50:44,402 --> 01:50:47,303
who will be blamed
for absolving them.

1618
01:50:48,072 --> 01:50:51,473
As if it's not enough
our country's been invaded by...

1619
01:50:51,509 --> 01:50:55,843
long-haired atheists
and addicts.

1620
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:59,338
Now you want to cast doubt
on our armed forces...

1621
01:50:59,383 --> 01:51:03,513
the sole healthy elements
in our country.

1622
01:51:03,554 --> 01:51:06,421
We dream of a renewal...

1623
01:51:06,457 --> 01:51:09,949
of a land with no parties,
Left nor Right...

1624
01:51:09,994 --> 01:51:12,258
obedient to God.

1625
01:51:12,863 --> 01:51:14,228
You want to ruin it.

1626
01:51:16,167 --> 01:51:20,695
I have a proposal for you.

1627
01:51:21,973 --> 01:51:23,565
I understand your scruples.

1628
01:51:25,042 --> 01:51:27,203
They honor you.

1629
01:51:27,244 --> 01:51:29,804
My idea should suit you
and the government...

1630
01:51:29,847 --> 01:51:31,246
and the palace.

1631
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:34,609
We'll divide the case in three.

1632
01:51:35,653 --> 01:51:37,917
First the trial
of the two criminals.

1633
01:51:37,955 --> 01:51:39,923
Let justice be done.

1634
01:51:40,458 --> 01:51:42,449
Second, the police authorities.

1635
01:51:42,493 --> 01:51:45,223
Their negligence is evident...

1636
01:51:46,230 --> 01:51:49,927
but can't be tried
by a circuit court.

1637
01:51:49,967 --> 01:51:53,960
It's strictly
an administrative matter.

1638
01:51:54,939 --> 01:52:00,070
Third, an action against
the rally organizers.

1639
01:52:00,111 --> 01:52:02,477
They and their loudspeakers
are responsible...

1640
01:52:02,513 --> 01:52:05,539
for the ensuing violence.

1641
01:52:06,150 --> 01:52:09,483
An old rule of thumb
is to always look...

1642
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:11,488
for those who benefit
from a crime.

1643
01:52:12,189 --> 01:52:15,852
The minister of justice
thought you were a leftist.

1644
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:18,590
I formally denied it.

1645
01:52:19,997 --> 01:52:22,261
Here's a list
of helpful witnesses.

1646
01:52:23,901 --> 01:52:26,461
It seems no one wanted
to kill the senator...

1647
01:52:26,504 --> 01:52:28,665
just intimidate him.

1648
01:52:29,373 --> 01:52:32,274
I trust I've convinced you...

1649
01:52:32,309 --> 01:52:35,767
to save the honor of the forces
of law and order.

1650
01:52:36,814 --> 01:52:42,480
But you're the sole master
of your conscience, after God.

1651
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:57,167
I won't be disgraced.

1652
01:52:57,201 --> 01:52:59,761
Indict me
and I'll commit suicide.

1653
01:52:59,804 --> 01:53:01,829
Dishonor is unbearable.

1654
01:53:01,872 --> 01:53:04,466
My blood will be on your hands.

1655
01:53:04,508 --> 01:53:07,671
Name and profession?

1656
01:53:08,512 --> 01:53:10,275
You must answer.

1657
01:53:20,157 --> 01:53:21,818
Sign your statement.

1658
01:53:31,235 --> 01:53:37,196
You are indicted
for premeditated murder.

1659
01:53:37,241 --> 01:53:39,038
The law allows 24 hours...

1660
01:53:39,076 --> 01:53:40,976
to superior officers
before their imprisonment.

1661
01:53:41,011 --> 01:53:43,809
To avoid the reporters,
use that door.

1662
01:54:13,377 --> 01:54:16,346
You're indicted
for premeditated murder.

1663
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:30,320
It's unbearable!

1664
01:54:30,961 --> 01:54:33,191
You've no right!

1665
01:54:39,603 --> 01:54:42,868
I've been thrown to the hounds.

1666
01:54:42,907 --> 01:54:44,397
Name and profession.

1667
01:54:48,846 --> 01:54:51,474
You're indicted
for premeditated murder.

1668
01:55:12,536 --> 01:55:13,696
Sit down.

1669
01:55:17,074 --> 01:55:20,043
For me, there's no choice.

1670
01:55:20,077 --> 01:55:23,478
Either I'm cleared
or I'll commit suicide.

1671
01:55:23,514 --> 01:55:25,414
Name and profession.

1672
01:55:25,449 --> 01:55:27,349
It's routine, General.

1673
01:55:27,384 --> 01:55:29,477
What did you do that day?

1674
01:55:30,487 --> 01:55:32,887
I was to attend
the Bolshoi Ballet.

1675
01:55:32,923 --> 01:55:37,622
Not out of love for the dance.
I'm not one of those perverts.

1676
01:55:37,661 --> 01:55:40,255
But it was a chance
to spot some Reds.

1677
01:55:43,734 --> 01:55:45,998
The day of the assassination...

1678
01:55:46,036 --> 01:55:49,233
you were told his life
was threatened.

1679
01:55:49,273 --> 01:55:54,609
No one told me about it!
I'm sure it was only a tactic...

1680
01:55:54,645 --> 01:55:56,579
to justify any incident.

1681
01:56:00,451 --> 01:56:03,147
My men couldn't
stop the truck...

1682
01:56:03,187 --> 01:56:06,918
but a man leaped
on the rear platform...

1683
01:56:06,957 --> 01:56:10,085
lithe and fierce as a tiger.

1684
01:56:18,836 --> 01:56:21,304
I knew no one
in that organization.

1685
01:56:21,338 --> 01:56:24,705
I've had no contacts
with this CROC.

1686
01:56:24,742 --> 01:56:28,439
You're seen here at a banquet
you gave for them...

1687
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:32,575
to thank them for keeping order
during a state visit.

1688
01:56:32,616 --> 01:56:35,983
Is he a Red?
Why is he after me?

1689
01:56:36,020 --> 01:56:38,511
His father was police chief.

1690
01:56:42,860 --> 01:56:45,658
The photo's phony.
It's not proof.

1691
01:56:46,230 --> 01:56:49,563
You're indicted
for premeditated murder.

1692
01:56:58,943 --> 01:57:01,411
Are you a martyr like Dreyfus?

1693
01:57:01,445 --> 01:57:03,242
Dreyfus was guilty!

1694
01:57:27,538 --> 01:57:28,903
Helen!

1695
01:57:37,014 --> 01:57:40,814
Helen, they're all indicted,
even the general.

1696
01:57:42,086 --> 01:57:44,111
The judge didn't back down.

1697
01:57:44,888 --> 01:57:47,049
Helen, it's as if
he were still alive.

1698
01:57:49,994 --> 01:57:51,894
It's a real revolution.

1699
01:57:52,696 --> 01:57:54,561
The government will fall...

1700
01:57:54,598 --> 01:57:56,998
and extremists
will be wiped out.

1701
01:57:57,034 --> 01:57:58,899
Election will be a landslide.

1702
01:58:11,882 --> 01:58:14,077
The deputy was not at the trial.

1703
01:58:14,118 --> 01:58:17,315
He died of a heart attack,
according to the coroner.

1704
01:58:17,888 --> 01:58:22,348
Several other witnesses
died before the trial.

1705
01:58:22,393 --> 01:58:24,122
A car accident...

1706
01:58:24,161 --> 01:58:25,389
a gas explosion...

1707
01:58:25,429 --> 01:58:28,023
a suicide, a drowning...

1708
01:58:28,065 --> 01:58:31,796
a work accident,
a second car accident...

1709
01:58:31,835 --> 01:58:34,030
and a heart attack
while driving.

1710
01:58:34,071 --> 01:58:38,440
''Foul play is doubted,''
says the new chief of police.

1711
01:58:38,475 --> 01:58:39,999
Vago was sentenced...

1712
01:58:40,044 --> 01:58:43,775
to 8 years in a farm prison...

1713
01:58:43,814 --> 01:58:46,214
where one year equals two years.

1714
01:58:46,250 --> 01:58:48,616
Yago got 1 1 years of the same.

1715
01:58:48,652 --> 01:58:51,314
Ten months
for disturbing the peace.

1716
01:58:51,355 --> 01:58:55,121
One year with a possibility
of paying it off.

1717
01:58:55,159 --> 01:58:58,151
The four indicted officers...

1718
01:58:58,195 --> 01:59:00,220
only received
administrative reprimands.

1719
01:59:00,264 --> 01:59:03,563
Yet the government
had to resign...

1720
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:08,731
after the leftists seemed
certain to win the elections.

1721
01:59:08,772 --> 01:59:10,262
Prior to the elections...

1722
01:59:10,307 --> 01:59:13,242
the army seized power
and dismissed the judge.

1723
01:59:13,277 --> 01:59:16,041
Senator George Pirou
died in a police car...

1724
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,605
of a clot in the brain...

1725
01:59:18,649 --> 01:59:21,117
said police officers.

1726
01:59:21,151 --> 01:59:23,119
Deported to the islands.

1727
01:59:23,153 --> 01:59:26,247
During questioning,
fell from the seventh floor...

1728
01:59:26,290 --> 01:59:28,588
trying to escape,
said the police.

1729
01:59:29,126 --> 01:59:32,857
Three years for revealing
official documents.

1730
01:59:32,896 --> 01:59:36,263
Also, the military regime
banned...

1731
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:38,734
long hair, miniskirts...

1732
01:59:38,769 --> 01:59:41,795
Sophocles, Tolstoy, Euripides...

1733
01:59:41,839 --> 01:59:43,670
Russian-style toasts...

1734
01:59:43,707 --> 01:59:45,004
strikes...

1735
01:59:45,042 --> 01:59:47,636
Aristophanes, Ionesco...

1736
01:59:47,678 --> 01:59:50,875
Sartre, Albee, Pinter...

1737
01:59:50,914 --> 01:59:53,940
freedom of the press,
sociology...

1738
01:59:53,984 --> 01:59:56,475
Beckett, Dostoevsky...

1739
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:59,318
modern music, pop music...

1740
01:59:59,356 --> 02:00:02,120
new math, and the letter ''z''...

1741
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:05,617
which means ''he is alive''
in ancient Greek.
