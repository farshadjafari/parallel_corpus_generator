00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:10,599
<i>A famous man once said:</i>

2
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:12,400
<i>"We create our own Demons".</i>

3
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:17,853
<i>Who said that? What does
that even mean? Doesn't matter.</i>

4
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:19,054
<i>I said it cause he said it.</i>

5
00:00:19,254 --> 00:00:22,556
<i>So now he was famous and basically
getting said by two well-known guys.</i>

6
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:25,809
<i>I don't, uh.. I'm gonna
start again.</i>

7
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:30,137
<i>Let's track this from the beginning.</i>

8
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:08,972
Half-hour 'till the
ball drops.

9
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:12,548
Tony Stark, great speech man!

10
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,177
I gave a speech?

11
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:14,737
- How was it?
- Edifying.

12
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:16,216
Unintelligible.

13
00:01:16,218 --> 00:01:18,453
Really? That's my favorite
kind, a winning combo.

14
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,543
- Hey, uh, where are we going?
- Uh, to town on each other,

15
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:22,597
probably back at your house.
I want to see your research.

16
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:24,417
Okay, you can see my
research, but that's..

17
00:01:24,593 --> 00:01:26,004
I'm not going to show
you my "town".

18
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:30,573
- Mr. Stark, Ho Yinsen.
- Oh, I finally met a man called Ho.

19
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,210
I'd like to introduce you to our
guest, Doctor Wu.

20
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,561
- Oh this guy.
- Mr. Stark.

21
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:37,506
Hey.

22
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:39,608
She's going to need a cardiologist
right away.

23
00:01:41,316 --> 00:01:42,745
- Bye!
- Perhaps another time?

24
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:47,009
<i>It started in Bern,
Switzerland, 1999.</i>

25
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:50,530
<i>The old days.</i>

26
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,849
<i>I never thought they'd
come back to bite me.</i>

27
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:59,067
Hey Tony! Aldrich Killian,
I'm a big fan of your work.

28
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:00,665
- My work?
- Who isn't? She needs me.

29
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:04,159
Well, of course, but Miss
Hansen my organization

30
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:06,936
has been tracking your research since
year two of MIT.

31
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,150
Oh wow, he made it.
He made the cut.

32
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:13,187
- What floor you going to, pal?
- Well now, that is an appropriate question.

33
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:16,414
The ground floor, actually, of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.

34
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:20,015
It's a privately-funded think tank called
"Advanced Idea Mechanics".

35
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:24,497
Uh, she'll take both. One to throw
away and one to not call.

36
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,930
"Advanced Idea Mechanics" or AIM
for short, you get it?

37
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,164
I see that 'cause it's on
your T-shirt.

38
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:30,707
Oh!!

39
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:33,646
Ladies, follow the mullet.
Ladies first.

40
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,780
Thank you. I'll call you.

41
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,778
- I am titillated by the notion of working with you.
- Yeah?

42
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,981
I'm going to ditch
these clowns.

43
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:43,183
I'll see you up on the roof
in five minutes.

44
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:46,146
I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real
quick if you know what I'm talkin' about.

45
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:47,409
I'll see you up there!

46
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:48,343
Damn betcha.

47
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:54,024
- Come on, I thought that was just a theory.
- Well.. it was.

48
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:56,679
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain

49
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,997
- that governs repair and chemically recode it.
- That's incredible.

50
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:03,770
Essentially, you're hacking into
the genetic operating system of a

51
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:04,893
- living organism.
- Exactly.

52
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:10,173
Can you not touch my plant? It's not..
she doesn't like it. She prefers..

53
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:11,282
She's not like the others.

54
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:12,776
Come on, let's go to
the bedroom.

55
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,986
Happy, leave her ficus alone.

56
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:16,698
No, seriously, don't

57
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,368
- And you're starting with plants?
- For now, yes.

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,879
I'm calling it "Extremis".

59
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,222
- Well, it's..
- Human application.

60
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:27,274
Exactly! Exactly!
Dentra-degree vitalization.

61
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:29,115
Disease prevention.

62
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:30,348
Even limb regrowth.

63
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,799
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.

64
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,889
- Wow!
- In Switzerland.

65
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:39,050
- That's better.
- This week.

66
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,502
You almost bought it,
didn't you?

67
00:03:52,027 --> 00:03:54,379
This is what I'm talking
about, the glitch.

68
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:56,021
Have you checked the telomerase
algorithm?

69
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:00,533
- We're good.
- Stay down.

70
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,734
You're right on me..

71
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,855
What the hell was that?

72
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:07,651
What the hell was that?

73
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:08,735
It's a glitch in my work.

74
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:10,728
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

75
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh, it's not Y2K..

76
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,825
Hey, Happy New Year!

77
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:14,681
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

78
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:16,822
Alright, I'll see you in the morning,
Okay? Good night.

79
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:17,175
- You good?

80
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:18,310
- Yep.
- I'll be right outside.

81
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:18,961
- Okay, cool.

82
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:44,550
<i>So, why am I telling you this? Because I
had just created demons.</i>

83
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:47,100
<i>And I didn't even know it.</i>

84
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:51,853
<i>Yeah, those were good times.</i>

85
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:54,004
<i>Then I moved on.</i>

86
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:58,887
<i>After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said "Goodbye" to the party scene.</i>

87
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:01,269
<i>I forgot that night in Switzerland.</i>

88
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,470
<i>These days I'm a changed man.</i>

89
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,302
<i>I'm different now.</i>

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,723
<i>I'm.. well, you know
who I am.</i>

91
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,692
Sir, please may I request

92
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:13,516
- just a few hours to calibrate..
- Nope!

93
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,358
Micro-repeater implanting
sequence complete!

94
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,185
As you wish, sir. I've
also prepared a

95
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,199
safety briefing for you
to entirely ignore.

96
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:24,851
Which I will.

97
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:26,273
Alright, let's do this.

98
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:31,245
Dummy. Hi Dummy.
How did you get that cap on your head?

99
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,379
You earned it.

100
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,682
Hey. Hey!

101
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:37,189
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

102
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:39,471
Blood on my mat, handle it.

103
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:43,694
Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours.

104
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,855
Focus up ladies.
Good evening

105
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,667
And welcome to the
birthing suite.

106
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:51,413
I am pleased to announce the
imminent arrival

107
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:54,281
of your bouncing,
badass baby brother.

108
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:57,534
Start titan and go white.
Stamp date and time.

109
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:01,404
Mark 42 autonomous prehensile
propulsion suit test.

110
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:03,009
Initialize sequence.

111
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:07,307
Jarvis, drop my needle.

112
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,382
Crap.

113
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,863
Alright, I think we got this.
Send them all.

114
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,432
Probably just a little fast, slow it down.
Slow it down just a.. little bit.

115
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:15,018
Cool it, will you Jarvis?

116
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:26,542
Come on.

117
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:28,435
I ain't scared of you.

118
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,209
I'm the best.

119
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:47,435
As always sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.

120
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:51,106
<i>I guess 72 hours is a long
time between siestas.</i>

121
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:54,178
<i>Didn't think it could
get any worse.</i>

122
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,711
<i>Then they had to go and
turn on the TV.</i>

123
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:02,423
<i>That's when 'He' happened.</i>

124
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,560
Some people call me a terrorist.

125
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:18,603
I consider myself a teacher.

126
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:23,127
America..

127
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:27,639
Ready for another lesson.

128
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,490
In 1864 in Sand Creek, Colorado.

129
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,543
The U.S. military waited until the friendly
Cheyenne Braves had all gone hunting.

130
00:08:35,643 --> 00:08:39,796
Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind.

131
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,427
And claim their land.

132
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:49,523
39 hours ago, the Ali Al Salem Air Base
in Kuwait was attacked.

133
00:08:50,393 --> 00:08:52,584
I did that.

134
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:56,326
A quaint military church, filled with
wives and children of course.

135
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:02,009
The soldiers were out
on maneuvers.

136
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,591
The "Braves" were away.

137
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:12,186
President Ellis, you continue to resist
my attempts to educate you, sir.

138
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,607
And now, you've missed
me again.

139
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:21,951
You know who I am.
You don't know where I am.

140
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:26,234
And you'll never see me coming.

141
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:31,947
And now that we seem to be back,
let's recap some of the frightening
developments in this story.

142
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,259
American airways were hijacked.

143
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:35,779
The nation remains
on high alert.

144
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,448
All attempts to find the Mandarin have
so far proved unsuccessful.

145
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,374
Central to my administration's response to this
terrorist event is a newly-minted resource.

146
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:47,255
I know him as Colonel
James Rhodes.

147
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:51,087
The American people will soon
know him as the Iron Patriot.

148
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:54,129
And how is President
Ellis responding?

149
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:58,582
By taking the guy they call "War Machine"
and giving him a paint job.

150
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:02,836
The same suit but painted red,
white and blue, look at that.

151
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,735
And they've also renamed
him Iron Patriot.

152
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:09,268
You know, just in case the
paint was too subtle.

153
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,289
It tested well with focus
groups, alright?

154
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,061
- I am Iron Patriot.
- Listen.

155
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:15,048
War Machine was a little too
aggressive, alright.

156
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,192
This sends a better message.

157
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:21,725
So what's really going on?
With Mandarin.

158
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:25,258
Seriously, can we talk
about this guy?

159
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,419
It's classified information,
Tony.

160
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,602
- Okay, there've been nine bombings.
- Nine.

161
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:35,235
The public only knows about three.

162
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,375
But here's the thing..
nobody can ID a device.

163
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:39,846
There's no bomb casings.

164
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,956
You know I can help.

165
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:45,429
Just ask. I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit. I got

166
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:45,951
Bomb disposal.

167
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,392
Catches explosions mid-air.

168
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:49,193
When's the last time you got
a good night's sleep?

169
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:52,062
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.

170
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:53,209
People are concerned about
you, Tony.

171
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,254
I'm concerned about you.

172
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,432
You gonna come at me like that?

173
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:57,297
No, look, I'm not trying
to be a dictator.

174
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:00,498
Would you mind signing my drawing?

175
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:03,134
If Richard doesn't mind. You alright
with this, Dick?

176
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:04,532
Fine with me.

177
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:07,803
- What is your name?
- Erin.

178
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:11,836
I loved you in "A Christmas Story"
by the way.

179
00:11:12,725 --> 00:11:14,797
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.

180
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:17,767
After New York, aliens,
come on.

181
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:19,178
They need to look strong.

182
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,471
Stopping the Mandarin is a
priority, but it's not..

183
00:11:22,873 --> 00:11:24,282
It's not superhero business.

184
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,183
No, it's not. Quite frankly.

185
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,597
It's American business.

186
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,700
That's why I said.
I.. got it.

187
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:30,096
Are you okay?

188
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,278
I broke the crayon.

189
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:33,908
Are you okay,
Mr. Stark?

190
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:36,048
Take it easy. Tony..

191
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,171
How did you get out
of the wormhole?

192
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:41,903
- Tony..
- What did you say?

193
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:48,096
Sorry. Have to check on
the suit.. make sure.. okay.

194
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:54,169
Check the heart, check the,
check the, is it the brain?

195
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:57,461
No sign of cardiac anatomy
or unusual brain activity.

196
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:59,484
Okay, so I was poisoned?

197
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:04,285
My diagnosis is that you've experienced
a severe anxiety attack.

198
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:07,918
Me?

199
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,678
Come on man, this isn't a
good look. Open up.

200
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,830
Sorry, I gotta split.

201
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:20,445
Badge.. Badge.. Badge.

202
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:23,826
Badge, guys. I put a memo in
the toilet, come on.

203
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,947
Tony has got them in his basement,
they're wearing

204
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,889
party hats, this is an asset
we can put to use.

205
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,129
Uh..huh. So, you're suggesting
that I replace

206
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,413
the entire janitorial
staff with robots?

207
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:35,563
What I'm saying is that the human
element of Human

208
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:37,575
Resources is our biggest
point of vulnerability.

209
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:39,415
We should start phasing it
out immediately.

210
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:41,336
- What!?
- Excuse me, Bambi.

211
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,700
- Did you just say that?
- Security.

212
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:47,068
Happy, okay, I am thrilled that you're
now the Head of Security.

213
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,812
- Okay, it is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.

214
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,381
- However,
- I do appreciate it.

215
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:52,884
- Since you've taken the post,
- You don't have to thank me.

216
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:55,994
We've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300 percent.

217
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:58,647
- Thank you.
- That's not a compliment.

218
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:00,498
"That's not a compliment"?
It is a compliment!

219
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:02,332
Clearly somebody is trying
to hide something.

220
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,158
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

221
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,321
Miss Potts, your four o'clock
is here.

222
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:07,009
Did you clear this four o'clock
with me?

223
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,462
Happy, we'll talk about
this later

224
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:11,095
But right now I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.

225
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:12,355
How so?

226
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:14,528
I used to work with him, and he
used to ask me

227
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,337
out all the time, so it's a
little awkward.

228
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:17,798
I don't like the sound of that.

229
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:26,474
- Pepper.
- Killian?

230
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:29,216
You look great..
you look really great.

231
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,322
God, you look great.

232
00:13:32,323 --> 00:13:35,639
I.. I.. I can't.. What on Earth have
you been doing?

233
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:39,010
Nothing fancy, just five years in the
hands of physical therapists

234
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:41,231
And please, call me Aldrich.

235
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,895
Uh, you were supposed to be
issued a security badge?

236
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:44,663
Happy, it's okay.

237
00:13:44,664 --> 00:13:46,065
- Yes?
- We're good.

238
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:47,385
- You sure?
- Yes.

239
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:49,167
- Stand down.
- I'm going to linger.

240
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:50,597
- Thank you.
- Right here, okay.

241
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,427
It's very nice to see
you, Killian.

242
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:01,413
Hey, guy

243
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:09,938
Merry Christmas.

244
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:14,907
After years dodging the president's ban
on "Immoral Biotech Research",

245
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:20,767
My think tank now has a little
something in the pipeline.

246
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:25,963
It's an idea we like to call
"Extremis".

247
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:28,537
I'm gonna turn your
lights down.

248
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:33,029
Regard the human brain.

249
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,760
Uh, wait, hold on, hold on, that's, that's
the universe, my bad.

250
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:44,442
But if I do that..

251
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:53,466
That's the brain, strangely mimetic
though, wouldn't you say?

252
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,786
- Wow, that's amazing!
- Thanks, it's mine.

253
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,998
- What?
- This.. you're inside my head.

254
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,645
It's a live feed. Come on up,
I'll prove it to you.

255
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:07,356
Come on.

256
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,539
Now, pinch my arm. I can take it.
Pinch me.

257
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:16,676
What is that?

258
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:18,754
The primary somatosensory
cortex.

259
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:23,899
It's the brain's pain center, but this..
is what I wanted to show you.

260
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:29,940
Now, "Extremis" harnesses our
bioelectrical potential.

261
00:15:30,537 --> 00:15:32,619
And it goes.. here.

262
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:36,799
This is essentially an empty slot,
and what this tells us is that

263
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:41,591
our mind, our entire DNA in fact,
is destined to be upgraded.

264
00:15:42,018 --> 00:15:43,018
Wow.

265
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:54,878
- Hello?
- Is this forehead of Security?

266
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,798
What? You know, look, I got a real job.
What do you want?

267
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,255
I'm working. I got something
going on here.

268
00:15:58,256 --> 00:15:59,852
- What? Harassing interns?
- Let me tell you something,

269
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:01,823
You know what happened when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?

270
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:03,447
They would laugh in my face.

271
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,044
I had to leave while I still
had a shred of dignity.

272
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:08,698
Now I got a real job. I'm
watching Pepper.

273
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,845
What's going on?
Fill me in.

274
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,336
- For real?
- Yeah.

275
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:14,754
Alright, so she's meeting up with this
scientist rich guy, handsome.

276
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:16,292
I couldn't make his face
at first, right?

277
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:17,230
And you know I'm good
with faces.

278
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,548
- Oh yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah, so I run his credentials

279
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:22,506
I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually
met the guy back in.

280
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:25,068
Where were we in '99? The
Science Conference?

281
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,248
Uh, Switzerland.

282
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:27,802
Right, right, exactly.

283
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:30,006
- Killian, I don't remember that guy.
- Of course you don't remember,

284
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:31,090
he's not a blonde with a big rack.

285
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,355
At first it was fine, they were
talking business, but now

286
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:35,965
it's like getting weird. He's showing
her his big brain.

287
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:38,923
- His what?
- Big brain, and she likes it.

288
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:41,144
Here, let me show you.
Hold on. See?

289
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:45,118
Look at what? You watching them? Flip the
screen and then we can get started.

290
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:48,191
I'm not a tech genius like you, just
trust me, get down here.

291
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:49,740
Flip the screen, then I can see
what they're doing.

292
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:51,105
I don't know how to flip
the screen!

293
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:53,453
Don't talk to me like that anymore.
You're not my boss.

294
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:57,606
Alright, I don't work for you, and
I don't trust this guy.

295
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:59,427
He's got another guy with
him, he's shifty.

296
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:01,609
Relax. I'm just asking you to
secure the perimeter.

297
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,296
Tell him to go out for a
drink or something.

298
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:05,396
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

299
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:07,292
This woman is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

300
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:09,215
- And you're just ignoring her.
- A giant brain?

301
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:11,343
Yeah, there's a giant brain,
there's a shifty character..

302
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:12,827
I'm going to follow this guy.
I'm going to run

303
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:15,435
his plates and if it
gets rough, so be it.

304
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,171
I miss you, Happy.

305
00:17:17,172 --> 00:17:19,647
Yeah, I miss you too but the
way it used to be.

306
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:20,790
Now you're off with
the "super friends"

307
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,346
I don't know what's going on
with you anymore.

308
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:23,239
The world's gettin' weird.

309
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,493
Hey I hate to cut you off,

310
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:25,553
- do you have your teaser on you?
- Why?

311
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:26,759
I think there's a gal in HR
who is trying

312
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,240
to steal some printer ink. You should
probably go over there and zap her.

313
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,298
Yeah, nice.

314
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:34,586
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of

315
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,659
any living organism and
recode its DNA.

316
00:17:38,386 --> 00:17:39,711
It would be incredible.

317
00:17:40,381 --> 00:17:44,159
Unfortunately, to my ears it also
sounds highly weaponizable.

318
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,077
As in enhanced soldiers, private
armies, and Tony is not..

319
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:49,290
Tony, Tony.

320
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:52,546
You know, I invited Tony
to join AIM.

321
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:57,085
13 years ago and he
turned me down.

322
00:17:57,086 --> 00:18:02,069
But something tells me now there is a new
genius on the throne, who doesn't have to

323
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,528
answer to Tony anymore and who
has slightly less of an ego.

324
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:13,240
It's going to be a no, Aldrich..
as much as I'd like to help you.

325
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:20,559
I can't say that I'm not disappointed,
but as my father used to say,

326
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,873
"Failure is the fog through which
we glimpse triumph."

327
00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:26,752
It's very deep, and I have no
idea what it means.

328
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:28,949
Well, he was kind of an
idiot, my old man.

329
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:32,232
I'm sure I'll see you again,
Pepper.

330
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,115
Happy!

331
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:47,825
The car is ready.. if you're
ready to go.

332
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:56,365
Yes, I just um, God, I forgot my other
thing so I'm just gonna..

333
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:27,704
I'm sorry I'm late. I was..
What is that?!

334
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,957
You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like Mark 15?

335
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,717
Yeah, something like that. You know
everybody needs a hobby.

336
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:38,567
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?

337
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:43,059
Just breaking it in, you know, it's always
a little pinky in the GUI-bagger at first.

338
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,481
Oh hey, did you see your
Christmas present?

339
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:49,787
Yes, I did. I don't know how I could have
missed that Christmas present.

340
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,403
Is it gonna fit through
the door?

341
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:53,618
Well actually, uh, that's a good question,
I got a team of

342
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:55,724
guys coming tomorrow. They're gonna
blow out that wall.

343
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:58,315
So, uh, tense?
Good day?

344
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:00,958
Oh shoulders, a little naughty.
Naughty girl.

345
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:04,883
I don't want to harp on this, but did you
like the custom rabbit?

346
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:06,974
Did I like it?

347
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:08,640
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.

348
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,645
I appreciate the thought
very much.

349
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:16,480
So why don't you lift up that facemask
and give me a kiss.

350
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:20,684
Huh, yup, dammit.
No can do.

351
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:25,190
You want to just kiss it on
the, uh, facial slit?

352
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:27,583
Why don't I run down to the
garage and see if

353
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:29,627
I can't find a crowbar to jimmy
that thing open?

354
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:33,801
A crowbar? Yeah. Oh, except there's
been a radiation leak.

355
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:35,676
- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.

356
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:38,714
At least let me get you
like a Hazmat suit.

357
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:41,894
Or a Geiger counter or
something like that.

358
00:20:43,886 --> 00:20:47,614
- Busted.
- This is a new level of lame.

359
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:50,881
- Sorry.
- You ate without me, already? On date night?

360
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:52,938
- He was just.
- You mean you.

361
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,198
Well yeah, I just mean
we were just..

362
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:58,087
just hosting you while I
finished up a little work.

363
00:20:58,088 --> 00:20:58,400
Uh Huh..

364
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:01,026
And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know
if you were coming home

365
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:03,101
Or you were having drinks with
Aldrich Killian.

366
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:06,996
What?

367
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:10,936
Aldrich Killian? What are you
checking up on me?

368
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,834
- Happy was concerned.
- No, you're spying on me.

369
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:16,565
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on. Come on. Pep..

370
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:20,277
Hey, I admit it! My fault.
Sorry.

371
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:22,740
I'm a piping hot mess.

372
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:27,785
It's been going on for a while..
I haven't said anything.

373
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:33,157
- Nothing's been the same since New York.
- Oh really?

374
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:36,089
I didn't notice that, at all.

375
00:21:36,203 --> 00:21:41,105
You experience things and then they're
over and you still can't explain them.

376
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:45,169
Gods, aliens, other dimensions..
I'm just a man in a can.

377
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:50,016
The only reason I haven't cracked up is
probably because you've moved in.

378
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,521
Which is great. I love
you, I'm lucky.

379
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:56,441
But honey.. I can't sleep.

380
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,343
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know, I tinker.

381
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:04,961
The threat is imminent.

382
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:07,604
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.

383
00:22:08,804 --> 00:22:12,272
That's you. And my suits,
they're uh..

384
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:14,750
- Machines.
- They're part of me.

385
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:19,911
- A distraction.
- Maybe.

386
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:40,609
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

387
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:47,705
- And you're going to join me.
- Better.

388
00:23:06,382 --> 00:23:07,673
Tony!

389
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:17,904
Power down!

390
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:29,383
I must have called it in my sleep.
That's not supposed to happen.

391
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:34,768
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

392
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:42,597
Can we just.. just let me.. just let me catch
my breath, okay? Don't go, alright? Pepper?

393
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:45,608
I'm going to sleep downstairs.
Tinker with that.

394
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:15,065
- Can you regulate?
- Yes, I can regulate.

395
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:17,006
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

396
00:24:26,683 --> 00:24:28,409
It's a decent batch.

397
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,722
Don't say I never did
nothing for you.

398
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:35,701
Thank you. I mean for
understanding.

399
00:24:45,147 --> 00:24:46,536
I'm sorry, buddy.

400
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:03,201
What're ya doing, buddy?

401
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:06,119
You out by yourself? A little date night?
Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?

402
00:25:06,684 --> 00:25:08,589
Yeah, a little movie called
"The Party's Over"

403
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,708
Starring you and your junkie girlfriend,
and here's the ticket.

404
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:13,991
No kidding. That doesn't
belong to you.

405
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:45,190
Savin! Help!
Help me!

406
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:13,170
A true story about fortune cookies.

407
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,834
They look Chinese. They
sound Chinese.

408
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:21,548
But they're actually an
American invention.

409
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:29,111
Which is why they're hollow, full of lies,
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.

410
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:35,229
My disciples just destroyed another
cheap American knock-off.

411
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:40,352
The Chinese Theater.
Mr. President.

412
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,917
I know this must be
getting frustrating.

413
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:47,913
But this season of terror is
drawing to a close.

414
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:55,031
And don't worry, the big one is
coming, your graduation.

415
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:11,021
- Hi.
- Oh, uh.

416
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:13,147
- Mind leaving that on?
- Sure.

417
00:28:19,928 --> 00:28:23,160
Sunday night's PBS,
"Downtown Abbey"

418
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,963
That's the show. He thinks
it's elegant.

419
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:33,414
One more thing, make sure everyone wears
their badges. He's a stickler

420
00:28:33,415 --> 00:28:36,176
for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't
let anyone in without them.

421
00:28:37,078 --> 00:28:39,221
We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.

422
00:28:39,222 --> 00:28:41,313
We're hoping he'll give
us the reaction.

423
00:28:41,314 --> 00:28:43,336
His reaction to the
latest attack.

424
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:44,955
Mr. Stark!

425
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,993
Our sources are telling us that this is
another Mandarin attack.

426
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:50,794
Anything else you can tell us?

427
00:28:51,156 --> 00:28:56,161
Hey Mr. Stark! When is somebody going
to kill this guy? Just sayin'.

428
00:28:58,802 --> 00:29:00,530
Is that what you want?

429
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:06,750
Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been
wanting to send to the Mandarin.

430
00:29:07,123 --> 00:29:09,691
I just didn't know how to
phrase it until now.

431
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,061
My name is Tony Stark and
I'm not afraid of you.

432
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:16,468
I know that you're a coward,
so I've decided

433
00:29:17,358 --> 00:29:19,380
That you just died, pal.

434
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:21,205
I'm gonna come get the body.

435
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:24,320
There's no politics here, it's just good
old-fashioned revenge.

436
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,824
There's no Pentagon. It's just
you and me.

437
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,872
And on the off-chance you're a man,
here's my home address:

438
00:29:30,873 --> 00:29:36,316
10880, Malibu Port, 90265.

439
00:29:36,838 --> 00:29:40,476
I'll leave the door unlocked. That's what
you wanted, right?

440
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:44,700
Bill me.

441
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,590
I've compiled a Mandarin
database for you, sir.

442
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:56,260
Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I.
and C.I.A. intercepts.

443
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:59,588
Initiating virtual crime scene
reconstruction.

444
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:04,359
Okay, what do we got here?

445
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:07,410
His name is an ancient
Chinese war mantle

446
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:08,990
Meaning "Advisor to the King".

447
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:11,804
South American insurgency tactics.

448
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:14,198
Talks like a Baptist preacher.

449
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:18,419
There's lots of pageantry going
on here, lots of theater.

450
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:20,194
Close.

451
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:23,472
The heat from the blast was in
excess of 3000 degrees Celsius.

452
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:27,163
Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporized instantly.

453
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:30,378
No bomb parts found in a 3-mile
radius of the Chinese theater.

454
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,070
No, sir.

455
00:30:33,402 --> 00:30:34,895
Talk to me, Happy.

456
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:55,897
When is a bomb not a bomb?

457
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:09,914
- Any military victims?
- Not according to public records, sir.

458
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:13,987
Bring up the thermo genic signatures
again, factor in 3000 degrees.

459
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:16,597
The oracle cloud has
completed analysis.

460
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:21,763
Accessing satellites and plotting the last
12 months of thermo genic occurrences now.

461
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:25,608
Take away everywhere that there's
been a Mandarin attack.

462
00:31:30,258 --> 00:31:31,425
Nope.

463
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:41,112
That. You sure that's
not one of his?

464
00:31:41,113 --> 00:31:43,526
It predates any known
Mandarin attack.

465
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,593
The incident was the use of a
bomb to assist a suicide.

466
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:47,595
Bring it around.

467
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:53,615
The heat signature is remarkably similar.
3000 degrees Celsius.

468
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:57,038
That's two military guys.

469
00:31:58,231 --> 00:31:59,701
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

470
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:01,817
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.

471
00:32:07,655 --> 00:32:12,944
Are we still at 'Ding-Dong'? We're
supposed to be on total security lockdown.

472
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:15,556
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?

473
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:20,607
There's only so much I can do, sir, when you
give the world's press your home address.

474
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,422
Right there's fine.

475
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:40,692
You're not the Mandarin, are you?
Are you?

476
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:45,654
You don't remember. Why I
am not surprised?

477
00:32:45,655 --> 00:32:47,368
Don't take it personally, I don't remember
what I had for breakfast.

478
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:49,826
- Gluten-free waffles, sir.
- That's right.

479
00:32:49,826 --> 00:32:54,624
Look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.. it's urgent.

480
00:32:56,532 --> 00:33:00,148
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship

481
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,228
- It's.. with her.
- Tony

482
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:08,250
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.

483
00:33:09,345 --> 00:33:13,625
Old botanist pal that I used
to know, barely.

484
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:17,028
Please don't tell me that there is a 12-year-old
kid waiting in the car that I've never met.

485
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:21,263
- He's 13. No, I need your help.
- What for? Why now?

486
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,711
Because I read the papers, and, frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

487
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,297
- I'll be fine.
- I'm sorry.

488
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:29,519
With Happy in the hospital, I didn't
know we were expecting guests.

489
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,455
We weren't.

490
00:33:30,457 --> 00:33:32,221
- And old girlfriends!
- She's not really.

491
00:33:32,222 --> 00:33:35,057
No, not really. It was
just one night.

492
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:38,455
- Yep.
- That's how you did it, isn't it?

493
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:39,443
It was a great night

494
00:33:39,444 --> 00:33:40,701
- Well.. you know
- Yeah.

495
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,579
You have saved yourself
a world of pain.

496
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,453
- What?
- Trust me.

497
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,589
We're going out of town.

498
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,457
- Okay, we've been through this. Nope.
- Yep!

499
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,857
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.

500
00:33:48,858 --> 00:33:50,452
- Great idea. Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

501
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:52,737
That's a terrible idea. Please don't
touch her bags.

502
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:54,643
Tony, this is how normal
people behave.

503
00:33:54,644 --> 00:33:56,775
I can't protect you out there.
I challenged.

504
00:33:56,776 --> 00:33:58,385
- Is this normal?
- Sadly, that..

505
00:33:58,386 --> 00:33:59,720
Yes, this is normal!

506
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:02,569
- Is very normal
- It's a big bunny, relax about it!

507
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,019
- Calm down!
- I got this for you.

508
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:07,348
- I'm aware of that.
- You still haven't even told me that you liked it!

509
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:08,038
I don't like it!

510
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,878
- I asked you three.
- You don't like it?!

511
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,260
- We are leaving the house, that's not even up for discussion.
- Guys.. do we hmm..

512
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:16,596
- What?
- Do we need to worry about that?

513
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,788
- I got you.
- I got you first.

514
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:09,739
Like I said, we can't
stay here.

515
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:20,940
Move! I'm right behind.

516
00:35:25,762 --> 00:35:27,324
Get her, I'm going to
find a way around.

517
00:35:27,784 --> 00:35:31,130
Stop stopping! Get her.
Get outside! Go!

518
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:56,021
Oh my God.
Tony!

519
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:11,764
Sir, Miss Potts is clear
of the structure.

520
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:46,601
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

521
00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:48,626
Working on it, sir. This is
a prototype.

522
00:37:03,652 --> 00:37:04,730
That's one.

523
00:37:06,322 --> 00:37:09,407
Sir, the suit is not combat-ready.

524
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:25,896
That's two.

525
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,434
Tony!

526
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,865
Sir, take a deep breath.

527
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:34,255
Flight power restored.

528
00:39:48,998 --> 00:39:51,940
Sir. Sir!

529
00:39:52,728 --> 00:39:55,030
Alright, kill the
alarm. I got it.

530
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:59,545
That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.

531
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:39,248
Snow? Where are we,
upstate?

532
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,903
We are 5 miles outside of
Rose Hills, Tennessee.

533
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:44,052
Why?

534
00:40:44,438 --> 00:40:49,114
Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we
doing here, this is

535
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,554
thousands of miles away? I've gotta get
Pepper, I've got to..

536
00:40:51,893 --> 00:40:53,184
I prepared a flight plan.

537
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,690
This was the location.

538
00:40:54,692 --> 00:40:56,914
Who asked you? Open
the suit.

539
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:59,650
I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.

540
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,650
Open Eject.

541
00:41:07,077 --> 00:41:08,155
That's brisk!

542
00:41:16,286 --> 00:41:18,143
Maybe I'll just cozy back
up for a bit.

543
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:21,329
I actually think I need
to sleep now, sir.

544
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:22,083
Jarvis.

545
00:41:24,588 --> 00:41:25,858
Jarvis?

546
00:41:29,092 --> 00:41:30,362
Don't leave me, buddy.

547
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:55,922
Stark Secure Server: Now transferring
to all known receivers.

548
00:41:55,923 --> 00:41:57,092
Pepper, it's me.

549
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:02,188
I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time, so first off.

550
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:04,697
I'm so sorry I put you
in harm's way.

551
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:07,025
That was selfish and stupid and
it won't happen again.

552
00:42:07,728 --> 00:42:11,505
Also, it's Christmas time. The
rabbit's too big. Done.

553
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:13,025
Sorry.

554
00:42:13,025 --> 00:42:17,550
And I'm sorry in advance because..
I can't come home yet.

555
00:42:19,094 --> 00:42:22,628
I need to find this guy. You
gotta stay safe.

556
00:42:22,628 --> 00:42:24,088
That's all I know.

557
00:42:24,748 --> 00:42:27,355
I just stole a poncho from
a wooden Indian.

558
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:53,485
Let's get you comfy.

559
00:42:55,577 --> 00:42:56,943
You happy now?

560
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:10,092
Freeze!

561
00:43:11,161 --> 00:43:14,360
- Don't move.
- You got me.

562
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,985
Nice potato gun.

563
00:43:18,885 --> 00:43:20,228
Barrel's a little long.

564
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,123
Between that and the wide gauge, it's
going to diminish your FPS.

565
00:43:28,164 --> 00:43:29,710
And now you're out of ammo.

566
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:31,728
What's that thing on
your chest?

567
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:37,177
It's a electromagnet. You should know,
you've got a box of them right here.

568
00:43:37,617 --> 00:43:38,952
What does it power?

569
00:43:47,806 --> 00:43:49,143
Oh my God!

570
00:43:54,213 --> 00:43:57,820
- Is that Iron Man?
- Technically, I am.

571
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,902
Technically, you're dead.

572
00:44:02,615 --> 00:44:05,362
- A valid point.
- What happened to him?

573
00:44:05,362 --> 00:44:08,106
Life. I built him. I take
care of him.

574
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,110
I'll fix him.

575
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,273
- Like a mechanic.
- Yeah.

576
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:19,199
If I was building Iron Man
and War Machine,

577
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:21,672
- It's Iron Patriot now.
- That's way cooler!

578
00:44:21,672 --> 00:44:22,833
No, it's not.

579
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:27,309
Anyway, I would have
added in the retro..

580
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:30,112
- Retro reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.

581
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:31,445
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?

582
00:44:31,447 --> 00:44:33,974
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

583
00:44:34,853 --> 00:44:36,257
Not a good idea!

584
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:38,331
What are you doing? You're going
to break his finger?

585
00:44:38,331 --> 00:44:40,251
He's in pain. He's been injured.
Leave him alone.

586
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,139
- Sorry.
- Are you?

587
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:45,809
Don't worry about it.
I'll fix it.

588
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:47,648
So, uh, who's home?

589
00:44:47,648 --> 00:44:52,708
Well, my mom already left for the diner
and dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

590
00:44:53,094 --> 00:44:56,003
I guess he won 'cause that
was six years ago.

591
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,186
Which happens, dads leave. No need to
be a pussy about it.

592
00:45:01,186 --> 00:45:05,715
Here's what I need: a laptop, a
digital watch, a cell phone,

593
00:45:05,715 --> 00:45:08,806
The pneumatic actuator from
your bazooka over there,

594
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,672
a map of town, a big spring,
and a tuna-fish sandwich.

595
00:45:11,672 --> 00:45:15,583
- What's in it for me?
- Salvation. What's his name?

596
00:45:15,585 --> 00:45:19,376
- Who?
- The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?

597
00:45:19,376 --> 00:45:21,972
How'd you know that?

598
00:45:21,974 --> 00:45:23,652
I got just the thing.

599
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:30,782
This is a piñata for a cricket. I'm kidding.
It's a very powerful weapon.

600
00:45:31,184 --> 00:45:33,842
Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,

601
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:35,536
It discourages bullying.

602
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:38,659
Non-lethal, just to cover
one's ass.

603
00:45:38,661 --> 00:45:43,391
- Deal. Deal? What'd you say?
- Deal.

604
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:46,695
- What's your name?
- Harley.

605
00:45:46,695 --> 00:45:48,094
- And you are..?
- The mechanic..

606
00:45:50,195 --> 00:45:51,346
Tony.

607
00:45:53,556 --> 00:45:55,409
You know what keeps going
through my head?

608
00:45:56,009 --> 00:45:57,650
Where's my sandwich?

609
00:46:35,764 --> 00:46:39,005
Stark Secure Server. Retinal
scan verified.

610
00:46:39,302 --> 00:46:40,387
Pepper, it's me.

611
00:46:40,677 --> 00:46:42,463
I've got a lot of apologies
to make

612
00:46:42,463 --> 00:46:44,197
and not a lot of time,
so first off.

613
00:46:44,536 --> 00:46:46,476
I'm so sorry I put you
in harm's way.

614
00:46:46,476 --> 00:46:49,231
That was selfish and stupid and
it won't happen again.

615
00:46:51,498 --> 00:46:53,829
Why were you at the
house tonight?

616
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:57,291
What was so important that you
had to speak to Tony?

617
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:02,865
I think that my boss is working
for the Mandarin.

618
00:47:04,702 --> 00:47:06,385
So if you still want
to talk about it,

619
00:47:06,387 --> 00:47:08,568
I suggest we get ourselves
someplace safe.

620
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:13,072
Your boss works for the
Mandarin you think,

621
00:47:13,074 --> 00:47:15,963
but Tony says you're a botanist.

622
00:47:15,965 --> 00:47:19,454
That figures. What I actually am is a
biological DNA coder running a team of

623
00:47:19,456 --> 00:47:22,992
40 out of a privately-funded think tank,
but sure you can call me a "botanist".

624
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:28,349
This boss of yours, does
he have a name?

625
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:29,936
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

626
00:47:32,746 --> 00:47:35,791
Well we took the house down sir, but
there's no sign of a body.

627
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,402
- I see.
- No Stark.

628
00:47:37,503 --> 00:47:38,677
I have to go.

629
00:47:39,512 --> 00:47:41,934
The Master is about to record
and he's a little..

630
00:47:43,135 --> 00:47:44,556
Well you know how he gets.

631
00:47:44,557 --> 00:47:47,476
Keep your appointment tonight and
call me when it's done.

632
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:55,963
Alright everybody. No talking and
no eye contact,

633
00:47:55,963 --> 00:47:57,936
unless you wanna get
shot in the face.

634
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,358
The Master is traveling.

635
00:48:35,043 --> 00:48:37,041
Well then, what are we waiting for?

636
00:48:39,896 --> 00:48:42,143
The sandwich was fair, the
spring was a little

637
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:44,293
rusty, the rest of the materials
I'll make do.

638
00:48:45,115 --> 00:48:47,659
By the way, when you said your
sister had a watch, I

639
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:49,951
was kinda hoping for something
a little more than that.

640
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:53,652
She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition.

641
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:57,838
- When can we talk about New York?
- Maybe never, relax about it.

642
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,407
- What about the Avengers, can you talk about them?
- I don't know. Later.

643
00:48:59,407 --> 00:49:00,637
Hey kid, give me more space.

644
00:49:05,302 --> 00:49:08,961
What's the official story here?
What happened?

645
00:49:09,186 --> 00:49:13,121
I guess this guy named Chad Davis,
used to live roundabouts.

646
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,911
Won a bunch of medals in the army.

647
00:49:17,148 --> 00:49:21,202
One day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.

648
00:49:21,797 --> 00:49:24,722
Then he blew himself
up right here.

649
00:49:30,393 --> 00:49:32,639
- Six people died, right?
- Yes.

650
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:34,289
- Including Chad Davis?
- Yea.

651
00:49:42,788 --> 00:49:44,121
Doesn't make sense.

652
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,396
Think about it. Six dead,
only five shadows.

653
00:49:48,396 --> 00:49:53,639
Yeah, but people said these shadows are
like the mark of souls gone to Heaven

654
00:49:54,202 --> 00:49:59,641
Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on
account of he didn't get a shadow.

655
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:03,144
- That's why there's only five.
- Do you buy that?

656
00:50:03,146 --> 00:50:04,744
That's what everyone says.

657
00:50:07,981 --> 00:50:10,717
You know what this crater
reminds me of?

658
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:12,753
I have no idea. I don't care.

659
00:50:14,175 --> 00:50:19,539
That giant wormhole, in
um, in New York.

660
00:50:19,539 --> 00:50:20,880
Does it remind you?

661
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:23,605
That's manipulative. I don't want
to talk about it.

662
00:50:23,606 --> 00:50:26,050
Are they coming back?
The aliens?

663
00:50:26,052 --> 00:50:27,612
Maybe, can you stop?

664
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:30,994
Remember when I told you that
I have an anxiety issue?

665
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,063
Does this subject make
you edgy?

666
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:33,585
Yeah, a little bit.

667
00:50:33,585 --> 00:50:35,835
Can I just catch my breath
for a second?

668
00:50:35,836 --> 00:50:39,938
Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you
need a plastic bag to breathe into?

669
00:50:39,938 --> 00:50:41,510
- Do you have medication?
- Nope.

670
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:43,132
- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.

671
00:50:43,132 --> 00:50:45,170
- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.

672
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,885
Are you going completely
mental?

673
00:50:46,887 --> 00:50:48,871
I can stop, do you want
me to stop?

674
00:50:48,871 --> 00:50:50,635
Remember when I said
to stop doing that?

675
00:50:50,637 --> 00:50:52,574
I swear to God, you're going
to freak me out.

676
00:50:54,615 --> 00:50:56,673
Ah man, you did it, didn't you?

677
00:50:56,675 --> 00:50:58,929
- You happy now?
- What did I say?

678
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:03,242
Hey, wait up!
Wait, wait.

679
00:51:08,302 --> 00:51:10,021
What the hell was that?

680
00:51:13,914 --> 00:51:16,376
Your fault, you spazzed me out.

681
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:19,947
Okay, back to business.
Where were we?

682
00:51:20,472 --> 00:51:25,257
The guy who died.. relatives? Mom?
Ms. Davis, where is she?

683
00:51:25,259 --> 00:51:28,260
- Where she always is.
- See, now you're being helpful.

684
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:39,067
Sorry. Lady, this uh,

685
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:42,077
Thank you.

686
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,702
Nice haircut, suits you.

687
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,974
- Nice watch.
- Yeah, limited edition.

688
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:51,862
Oh, I don't doubt it.

689
00:51:53,518 --> 00:51:55,177
Well.. have a good evening.

690
00:52:18,277 --> 00:52:22,170
Ms. Davis, Mind if
I join you?

691
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,722
- Free country.
- It sure is.

692
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:30,849
Alright

693
00:52:32,793 --> 00:52:37,063
- Where'd you like to start?
- I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss.

694
00:52:37,617 --> 00:52:39,650
I want to know what you
think happened

695
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:47,554
I brought your damn file.
You take it and go.

696
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:50,780
Whatever was in here, he
wanted no part of it.

697
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:56,257
Clearly, you were waiting for someone else.
Supposed to meet somebody here?

698
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,268
Yeah.

699
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:15,186
Ms. Davis, your son didn't kill
himself. I guarantee

700
00:53:15,188 --> 00:53:19,177
you he didn't kill anyone.
Someone used him.

701
00:53:20,226 --> 00:53:23,492
- What?
- As a weapon.

702
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:30,748
You're not the person who called
me after all, are you?

703
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,704
Actually, I am.

704
00:53:36,778 --> 00:53:40,577
Hey, hey! What's all this about?
The hell's going on here?

705
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:42,286
It's called an arrest.

706
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:46,400
- Sheriff, is it?
- Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?

707
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,844
- Homeland Security. We good here?
- No, we're not good.

708
00:53:50,844 --> 00:53:54,847
- I need a little more information than that.
- Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.

709
00:53:54,847 --> 00:53:59,148
Yeah, well, why don't you get on the
horn to Nashville and upgrade me?

710
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:02,210
Alright, you know what, I was hoping
to do this the smart way, but uh,

711
00:54:02,331 --> 00:54:04,492
The fun way's always good.

712
00:54:05,693 --> 00:54:06,893
Deputy, get this woman and..

713
00:54:20,981 --> 00:54:23,702
Hey hot wings, you wanna party?
You and me, let's go.

714
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:38,838
- Crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

715
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:41,599
Watch this.

716
00:55:47,538 --> 00:55:50,380
You walked right into this one. I've dated
hotter chicks than you.

717
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,664
That's all you got? Cheap trick
and a cheesy one-liner?

718
00:55:56,664 --> 00:55:59,025
Sweetheart, that could be the name
of my autobiography.

719
00:57:01,061 --> 00:57:03,101
- Let me go!
- Help me! Help me!

720
00:57:09,306 --> 00:57:11,788
Hey kid, what would you
like for Christmas?

721
00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:13,489
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry.

722
00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:16,630
No, no, I think he was trying to say
"I want my goddamn file."

723
00:57:16,952 --> 00:57:18,913
It's not your fault kid.

724
00:57:21,112 --> 00:57:22,853
Remember what I told you
about bullies?

725
00:57:28,677 --> 00:57:32,079
You like that, West World? That's
the thing about smart guys.

726
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:34,760
We always cover our ass.

727
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,815
You're welcome!

728
00:58:02,097 --> 00:58:05,559
- For what? Did I miss something?
- Me saving your life.

729
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:08,159
A: Saved you first
B: Thanks, sort of

730
00:58:08,702 --> 00:58:11,322
And C: If you do someone a solid, don't
be a yurts alright,

731
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:13,844
just play it cool otherwise you
come off grandiose.

732
00:58:15,545 --> 00:58:17,186
Unlike you?

733
00:58:18,306 --> 00:58:21,449
Admit it: you need me.
We're connected.

734
00:58:21,588 --> 00:58:23,849
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,

735
00:58:23,851 --> 00:58:26,710
keep your trap shut, and
guard the suit.

736
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,427
And stay connected to the
telephone because

737
00:58:28,427 --> 00:58:29,731
if I call you better
pick up. Okay?

738
00:58:29,733 --> 00:58:32,434
Can you feel that?
We're done here.

739
00:58:32,896 --> 00:58:35,536
Move out of the way or I'm going to
run you over. Bye kid.

740
00:58:42,646 --> 00:58:46,208
I'm sorry kid. You
did good.

741
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:49,509
So now you're just going to leave
you here, like my dad?

742
00:58:50,525 --> 00:58:54,751
Yeah. Wait, you're guilt-tripping
me, aren't you?

743
00:58:54,753 --> 00:58:56,509
I'm cold.

744
00:58:56,849 --> 00:58:59,590
I can tell. You know how I can tell?

745
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,351
'Cause we're connected.

746
00:59:05,655 --> 00:59:07,735
It was worth a shot.

747
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,606
What happened to the picture?

748
00:59:37,072 --> 00:59:39,594
The entire East coast.. the
satellites are down.

749
00:59:41,974 --> 00:59:43,456
We have an unauthorized broadcast

750
00:59:43,987 --> 00:59:46,030
Mr. Vice President, I think
you should see this.

751
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,601
Oh my God, not again.

752
00:59:51,804 --> 00:59:53,833
Is the President getting this?

753
01:00:04,353 --> 01:00:06,255
Mr. President.

754
01:00:06,556 --> 01:00:08,356
Only two lessons remain.

755
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:11,838
I intend to finish this before
Christmas morning.

756
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:17,521
Meet Thomas Richards. Good strong
name, good strong job.

757
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:23,485
Thomas here is an accountant for
the Roxxon Oil Corporation.

758
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:28,809
And I'm sure he's a
really good guy.

759
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:36,853
I'm going to shoot him in the head,
live on your television, in 30 seconds.

760
01:00:37,735 --> 01:00:42,336
The number for this telephone is in your
cell phone. Exciting, isn't it?

761
01:00:42,617 --> 01:00:44,697
Imagining how it got there.

762
01:00:44,896 --> 01:00:51,121
America, if your president calls me in
the next half-minute, Tom lives.

763
01:00:51,422 --> 01:00:52,382
Go.

764
01:00:55,164 --> 01:00:56,418
How did he hack my phone?

765
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,326
We can't allow terrorists
to dictate

766
01:00:58,327 --> 01:00:59,532
I have to make this call.

767
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:01,126
I'd strongly advise
against that.

768
01:01:01,128 --> 01:01:02,728
This is the right thing to do.

769
01:01:30,623 --> 01:01:33,097
There's just one lesson left,
President Ellis,

770
01:01:33,097 --> 01:01:35,306
so run away and kiss your
children goodbye

771
01:01:35,306 --> 01:01:37,443
Because nothing, not your army,
not your red,

772
01:01:37,445 --> 01:01:39,349
white, and blue attack dog,
can save you.

773
01:01:42,992 --> 01:01:44,192
I'll see you soon.

774
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:49,844
Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic
right now.

775
01:01:49,846 --> 01:01:52,516
Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.

776
01:01:52,518 --> 01:01:55,436
We have a possible point of origin in
Pakistan and the Patriot is ready to strike.

777
01:01:55,436 --> 01:01:56,358
- Right now!
- Yes, sir.

778
01:02:27,938 --> 01:02:28,898
Don't move!

779
01:02:36,103 --> 01:02:37,103
Uh, hang on a second.

780
01:02:38,143 --> 01:02:38,856
Hello.

781
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:44,105
You ever look up and everything starts glowing
from the inside out, a kind of bright orange.

782
01:02:44,706 --> 01:02:47,150
- Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?
- It's me, pal.

783
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:50,351
Now last time I went missing, if I remember
correctly, you went looking for me.

784
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:53,469
- What are you doing?
- A little talking, making friends in Pakistan.

785
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:54,775
What are you doing?

786
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:58,155
- Your re-design, your big re-brand,
that was AIM, right?
- Yeah.

787
01:02:58,755 --> 01:03:02,438
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comsat
right now, I need your login.

788
01:03:02,777 --> 01:03:04,617
Same as it's always been,
War Machine 68.

789
01:03:04,617 --> 01:03:05,579
And password please?

790
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:08,166
Well, look, I gotta change it every time
you hack in, Tony.

791
01:03:08,168 --> 01:03:11,202
It's not the eighties, nobody says "hack"
anymore, give me your login.

792
01:03:12,724 --> 01:03:15,786
"War Machine ROX" with
an X, all caps.

793
01:03:19,288 --> 01:03:23,489
- Yeah okay.
- That is so much better than Iron Patriot.

794
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,141
That ain't gonna cut it.

795
01:04:09,822 --> 01:04:11,985
Excuse me sir, I don't know who..

796
01:04:14,706 --> 01:04:17,387
Mom, I need to call you back. Something
magical is happening.

797
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:20,045
- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Keep it down.

798
01:04:20,045 --> 01:04:22,030
- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.

799
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:23,425
I knew you were still alive!

800
01:04:23,427 --> 01:04:25,072
Come on in and close the door.

801
01:04:30,114 --> 01:04:31,677
- Wow, can I just say sir?
- Yeah.

802
01:04:32,996 --> 01:04:33,942
I am your biggest fan.

803
01:04:33,943 --> 01:04:36,480
First, is this your van or
is anyone else gonna come in?

804
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:37,668
No, no, it's just us.

805
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:38,800
What's your name?

806
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,994
- Gary.
- Gary.

807
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:42,320
Oh wow.

808
01:04:42,322 --> 01:04:46,364
Right there's fine. I get a
lot of this, it's okay.

809
01:04:46,364 --> 01:04:47,684
Can I just say?

810
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:51,449
- Yeah.
- I don't know if you can tell but I have like

811
01:04:51,969 --> 01:04:54,952
Patterned my whole look after you. My
hair's a little,

812
01:04:54,954 --> 01:04:57,610
it's not right because there's
some product in it.

813
01:04:57,612 --> 01:04:58,112
Right.

814
01:04:59,532 --> 01:05:01,847
I don't want to make things
awkward for you

815
01:05:01,847 --> 01:05:04,054
- No.
- But I do have to show you.. boom!

816
01:05:05,297 --> 01:05:06,797
Hispanic Scott Baio?

817
01:05:07,936 --> 01:05:09,498
- Oh, I'm sorry, is that me?
- Yeah.

818
01:05:09,898 --> 01:05:12,797
It's.. I mean. I had them do it
off a doll that I made,

819
01:05:12,797 --> 01:05:16,021
so it's not like it's off a picture. So
it's a little bit.

820
01:05:16,023 --> 01:05:18,543
Jerry, for a moment, listen
to me here.

821
01:05:19,264 --> 01:05:21,213
I don't want to clip your
wings here.

822
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:22,905
We're both a little over-excited.

823
01:05:23,226 --> 01:05:25,748
I have an issue. I'm chasing bad
guys, trying to grapple

824
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,829
with something from some
hard-crypt data files.

825
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:29,509
I don't have enough juice.

826
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:33,311
I need you to jump on the roof,
recalibrate the ISDNs

827
01:05:33,911 --> 01:05:37,047
- Pump it up by about 40%.
- Got it.

828
01:05:37,048 --> 01:05:37,858
Alright, it's a mission.

829
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:38,634
Yeah.

830
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:40,297
Tony needs Gary.

831
01:05:40,797 --> 01:05:41,746
And Gary needs Tony.

832
01:05:41,748 --> 01:05:42,797
Be quiet about it.

833
01:05:42,998 --> 01:05:44,097
Go.

834
01:06:06,692 --> 01:06:09,614
What would you regard as the defining
moment of your life?

835
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:13,576
Well uh, I think that would be the day I
decided not to let my injury beat me.

836
01:06:15,936 --> 01:06:18,860
- Can you please state your name for the camera?
- Ellen Brandt.

837
01:06:19,179 --> 01:06:23,541
Okay, so, the injections are
administered periodically.

838
01:06:23,543 --> 01:06:28,025
Addiction will not be tolerated and those who
cannot regulate will be cut from the program.

839
01:06:29,226 --> 01:06:36,309
Once misfits, cripples.. you are the next
iteration of human evolution.

840
01:06:40,592 --> 01:06:44,523
Hi everybody. Before we start, I promise
you, looking back at your life there will be

841
01:06:44,523 --> 01:06:48,635
nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious
risk that you prudently elected to forego.

842
01:06:50,137 --> 01:06:52,358
Today is your glory. Let's begin!

843
01:07:03,684 --> 01:07:06,965
We gotta get out of here! Gotta get out of here!
Get 'em out! Get 'em out of here!

844
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,932
A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.

845
01:07:18,373 --> 01:07:20,655
This stuff doesn't always
work, right, pal?

846
01:07:21,054 --> 01:07:23,155
It's faulty, but you found a
buyer, didn't ya?

847
01:07:23,697 --> 01:07:25,717
Sold it to the Mandarin.

848
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,581
What happened? Fun fact.

849
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:38,346
Before he built rockets
for the Nazis.

850
01:07:38,704 --> 01:07:46,704
The idealistic Werner von Braun dreamed
of space travel.. he stargazed.

851
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:52,672
You know what he said when the
first V2 hit London?

852
01:07:53,393 --> 01:07:56,715
The rocket performed perfectly.

853
01:07:58,518 --> 01:08:00,798
It just landed on the wrong planet.

854
01:08:02,518 --> 01:08:07,402
See we all begin wide-eyed..
"pure science".

855
01:08:07,922 --> 01:08:12,164
Then the ego steps in,
the obsession

856
01:08:13,726 --> 01:08:19,967
And when you look up, you're
a long way from shore.

857
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:27,134
You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I
mean you gave your research to a think tank.

858
01:08:27,135 --> 01:08:30,567
Yeah but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.

859
01:08:30,568 --> 01:08:32,537
That's exactly what we used to do.

860
01:08:33,097 --> 01:08:34,658
So don't judge yourself.

861
01:08:36,618 --> 01:08:38,099
Thank you, Pepper.

862
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:41,542
I really appreciate that.

863
01:08:49,426 --> 01:08:49,942
Hi, good evening

864
01:08:49,943 --> 01:08:51,207
- Good evening.
- Come on in.

865
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:54,750
Maya, run!

866
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,192
Hi Pepper.

867
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:02,712
So you want to tell me why you were
at Stark's mansion last night?

868
01:09:02,713 --> 01:09:06,354
I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you
and the Master were gonna blow the place up.

869
01:09:06,636 --> 01:09:10,617
Oh I see, so you were trying to save Stark..
when he threatened us

870
01:09:10,618 --> 01:09:12,057
I told you, Killian, we can use him.

871
01:09:13,881 --> 01:09:15,164
Pepper, Pepper, Pepper

872
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:18,725
Look if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.

873
01:09:19,085 --> 01:09:22,184
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now he has one.

874
01:09:26,956 --> 01:09:32,189
This is Support Team Blue 0, sending coordinates
for suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.

875
01:09:32,189 --> 01:09:32,765
Copy.

876
01:09:41,097 --> 01:09:42,176
Nobody move!

877
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,207
Support Blue 0, unless the Mandarin's
next attack on the U.S.

878
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:53,264
involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think
you messed up again.

879
01:09:54,784 --> 01:09:59,747
Yes, you're free, if you weren't
before. Yes ma'am.

880
01:09:59,948 --> 01:10:03,710
Iron Patriot on the job, happy to help,
no need to thank me, it's my pleasure.

881
01:10:12,756 --> 01:10:15,257
Savin, I've acquired the Patriot armor.

882
01:10:15,259 --> 01:10:19,198
You want this suit? You gonna have
to pry at my cold dead body out of it.

883
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:20,680
That's the plan, Colonel.

884
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,576
Harley, tell me what is happening,
give me a full report.

885
01:10:24,676 --> 01:10:28,283
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy, do you
want me to keep eating it?

886
01:10:28,685 --> 01:10:29,685
How much did you have?

887
01:10:29,685 --> 01:10:30,685
Two or three bowls.

888
01:10:30,686 --> 01:10:32,990
- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.

889
01:10:32,992 --> 01:10:34,966
That means you're fine,
give me Jarvis.

890
01:10:35,408 --> 01:10:36,470
Jarvis, how are we?

891
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:38,895
It's totally fine sir. I seem to do quite
well for a stretch and

892
01:10:38,896 --> 01:10:41,177
then at the end of the sentence I
say the wrong cranberry.

893
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:44,819
And sir, you were right. Once I factored
in available AIM downlink

894
01:10:44,819 --> 01:10:48,115
facilities I was able to pinpoint the
Mandarin's broadcast signal.

895
01:10:48,815 --> 01:10:52,918
What're we talkin'? The Far East, Europe, North
Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, where is it?

896
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:54,539
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

897
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:58,650
Okay, kid, I'm going to have to walk
you through rebooting Jarvis's

898
01:10:58,652 --> 01:11:00,783
speech drive, but not right now.

899
01:11:01,207 --> 01:11:02,283
Harley, where is he really?

900
01:11:02,283 --> 01:11:04,163
Just look on the screen and
tell me where it is.

901
01:11:05,725 --> 01:11:07,171
Um.. it does say Miami, Florida.

902
01:11:07,171 --> 01:11:09,728
Okay, first things first,
I need the armor.

903
01:11:09,967 --> 01:11:11,242
Where are we at with it?

904
01:11:11,243 --> 01:11:12,409
Uh, it's not charging.

905
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:23,118
Actually, sir, it is charging, but
the power source is questionable.

906
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:25,658
It may not succeed in revitalizing
the Mark 42.

907
01:11:25,658 --> 01:11:27,948
What's questionable about electricity?

908
01:11:27,948 --> 01:11:31,060
Alright, it's my suit and I can't..
I'm not gonna..

909
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:35,462
- Oh God, not again.
- Tony

910
01:11:37,425 --> 01:11:40,645
Are you having another attack? I
didn't even mention New York.

911
01:11:40,646 --> 01:11:44,429
Right, and then you just said it, by name,
while denying having said it.

912
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:45,609
Okay, um, uh

913
01:11:48,351 --> 01:11:49,963
Oh God, what am I gonna do?

914
01:11:49,965 --> 01:11:52,113
Just breathe, really just breathe.

915
01:11:53,314 --> 01:11:56,836
- You're a mechanic, right?
- Right.

916
01:11:58,036 --> 01:12:01,396
- You said so.
- Yes, I did.

917
01:12:02,358 --> 01:12:04,399
What don't you just build something?

918
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:20,009
Okay, thanks kid.

919
01:14:04,029 --> 01:14:08,273
Why is it so hot in here? I told
you to put it at 68.

920
01:14:09,073 --> 01:14:12,875
My fault again.. let me tell you something
sweetheart, I am not your personal..

921
01:15:15,992 --> 01:15:17,873
I wouldn't go in there for twenty minutes!

922
01:15:19,293 --> 01:15:22,528
- Now, which one of you is Vanessa?
- That's me.

923
01:15:22,529 --> 01:15:24,730
Ah, Nessie.

924
01:15:25,016 --> 01:15:29,603
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?

925
01:15:29,604 --> 01:15:32,020
There's some guy over here.

926
01:15:32,021 --> 01:15:34,784
They're made by Americans,
based on the Japanese recipes.

927
01:15:34,786 --> 01:15:35,469
Hey!

928
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:39,595
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

929
01:15:39,596 --> 01:15:41,206
- Don't move.
- I am not moving.

930
01:15:41,207 --> 01:15:43,893
If you want something, take it, although
the guns are all fake

931
01:15:43,894 --> 01:15:46,409
because those wankers wouldn't trust
me with the real ones.

932
01:15:46,411 --> 01:15:48,791
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

933
01:15:49,351 --> 01:15:53,894
Heard enough. You're not him, the
Mandarin, the real guy, where?

934
01:15:54,895 --> 01:15:59,216
- Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?
- He's here. He's here.

935
01:15:59,436 --> 01:16:02,238
- But he's not here. He's here but he's not here.
- What do you mean?

936
01:16:02,338 --> 01:16:04,725
It's complicated, hey, it's
complicated, alright?

937
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,060
- It is?
- It's complicated.

938
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,605
Uncomplicated. Ladies out, get out
of the bed

939
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:08,942
get in the bathroom.

940
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:12,301
Sit.

941
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:25,333
My name is Trevor, Trevor Slattery.

942
01:16:25,335 --> 01:16:26,673
What are you?

943
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,860
What're you a decoy? You're
a double, right?

944
01:16:29,862 --> 01:16:31,716
What? No. An understudy?
Absolutely not.

945
01:16:32,476 --> 01:16:34,318
Don't hurt me please!
I'm an actor.

946
01:16:35,417 --> 01:16:38,171
You got a minute to live, fill it
with words.

947
01:16:38,872 --> 01:16:42,162
It's just a role. "The Mandarin", see,
it's not real.

948
01:16:42,483 --> 01:16:44,082
Then how did you get here,
Trevor?

949
01:16:46,765 --> 01:16:52,390
Um, well, uh, I have a little problem
with, um, substances,

950
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:57,171
and I ended up doing things..
no two ways about it

951
01:16:57,171 --> 01:17:00,453
- In the street that a man shouldn't do.
- Next!

952
01:17:00,453 --> 01:17:05,855
Then, they approached me about the role
and they knew about the drugs.

953
01:17:05,856 --> 01:17:07,472
What'd they say they'd get
you off them?

954
01:17:07,474 --> 01:17:08,497
Said they'd give me more.

955
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:11,921
They gave me things. They gave
me this palace.

956
01:17:11,922 --> 01:17:15,181
They gave me plastic surgery. They
gave me things.

957
01:17:16,903 --> 01:17:18,302
Did you just nod off?

958
01:17:19,463 --> 01:17:23,546
No, the lovely speedboat! And the
thing was, he needed someone.

959
01:17:23,948 --> 01:17:27,550
To take credit for some
"accidental explosions".

960
01:17:31,109 --> 01:17:31,951
"He"?

961
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,793
- Killian?
- Killian.

962
01:17:36,795 --> 01:17:39,117
- He created you?
- He created me.

963
01:17:40,317 --> 01:17:42,518
- Custom-made terror threat
- Yes!

964
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:48,121
Yes, his think tank thinked it up, the
pathology of the serial killer.

965
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,603
The manipulation of Western
iconography.

966
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:56,247
Ready for another lesson?
Blah blah blah.

967
01:17:58,046 --> 01:18:01,006
Of course, it was my performance that
brought the Mandarin to life.

968
01:18:01,229 --> 01:18:06,572
Your performance? Where
people die?

969
01:18:07,532 --> 01:18:10,033
No, no, look around you,
costumes, green screen.

970
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:14,576
Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this
stuff, and when I was, movie magic, love.

971
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:18,257
I'm sorry but I got a best friend who's in
a coma and he might not wake up.

972
01:18:18,259 --> 01:18:21,740
So you're going to have to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.

973
01:18:28,122 --> 01:18:30,926
Okay, Trevor, what'd you tell him?

974
01:18:31,627 --> 01:18:33,707
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?

975
01:18:35,228 --> 01:18:37,949
- No.
- You should have pressed the panic button.

976
01:18:38,789 --> 01:18:40,832
Well I panicked, but then
I handled it.

977
01:19:03,253 --> 01:19:04,974
Just like old times, huh?

978
01:19:04,975 --> 01:19:07,655
Oh yeah, with zip-ties.
It's a ball.

979
01:19:07,935 --> 01:19:09,199
It wasn't my idea.

980
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:11,658
Okay, so you took
Killian's card

981
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:12,609
I took his money.

982
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:15,421
And here you are 13 years
later in a dungeon.

983
01:19:15,621 --> 01:19:16,502
- No.
- Yeah.

984
01:19:16,601 --> 01:19:20,623
- No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.
- Yeah..

985
01:19:24,506 --> 01:19:28,859
A lot's happened Tony,
and I'm close.

986
01:19:29,149 --> 01:19:32,210
Extremis is practically stable.

987
01:19:32,211 --> 01:19:32,550
I'm telling you it isn't.

988
01:19:32,551 --> 01:19:37,213
I saw him on the street, people are going 'bang', they're
painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.

989
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:40,095
Then help me fix it.

990
01:19:44,118 --> 01:19:45,119
Did I do that?

991
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,682
- Yes.
- I remember the night, not the morning

992
01:19:50,404 --> 01:19:51,583
Is this what you've been
chasing around?

993
01:19:51,585 --> 01:19:53,185
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.

994
01:19:54,886 --> 01:20:00,088
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.

995
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:04,851
Wanted to help people, now
look at you.

996
01:20:06,453 --> 01:20:08,673
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who..

997
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,600
still has a soul.

998
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:23,582
Get me out of here, come on.

999
01:20:25,423 --> 01:20:30,506
You know what my old man used to say to me?
His favorite of many sayings.

1000
01:20:31,466 --> 01:20:35,988
"The early bird gets the worm, the second
mouse gets the cheese".

1001
01:20:35,989 --> 01:20:38,603
You're not still pissed about
the Switzerland thing, are you?

1002
01:20:38,604 --> 01:20:39,952
How can I be pissed you, Tony?

1003
01:20:40,671 --> 01:20:42,842
I'm here to thank you. You've
given me the

1004
01:20:42,844 --> 01:20:45,114
greatest gift that anybody's
ever given me.

1005
01:20:45,475 --> 01:20:48,886
Desperation. If you think
back to Switzerland,

1006
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:51,639
you said you'd meet me on
the rooftop, right?

1007
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:57,752
Well for the first 20 minutes, I actually
thought you'd show up.

1008
01:20:58,054 --> 01:21:00,103
For the next hour, I uhh..

1009
01:21:01,203 --> 01:21:07,868
Well I considered taking that one step
shortcut to the lobby, if you know I mean.

1010
01:21:07,868 --> 01:21:10,828
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

1011
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:14,605
But as I looked out over that city, nobody
knew I was there,

1012
01:21:14,707 --> 01:21:17,333
nobody could see me, no one
was even looking.

1013
01:21:17,533 --> 01:21:22,677
I had a thought that would guide
me for years to come.

1014
01:21:23,596 --> 01:21:24,917
Anonymity, Tony.

1015
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:29,582
Thanks to you, it's been my mantra
ever since, right?

1016
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:31,881
You simply rule from behind
the scenes.

1017
01:21:31,882 --> 01:21:34,203
Because the second you
give evil a face

1018
01:21:34,363 --> 01:21:38,025
Bin Laden, Gaddafi, The Mandarin

1019
01:21:38,207 --> 01:21:39,349
You hand the people a target.

1020
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:40,327
You're something else.

1021
01:21:43,372 --> 01:21:44,649
You have met him, I assume?

1022
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:45,972
Yeah, Sir Lawrence Oblivion.

1023
01:21:46,253 --> 01:21:49,416
I know he's a little over the top sometimes..
it's not entirely my fault.

1024
01:21:49,417 --> 01:21:51,578
He has a tend.. he's
a stage actor.

1025
01:21:52,377 --> 01:21:54,939
They say his Lear was the toast of
Croydon, wherever that is.

1026
01:21:55,538 --> 01:21:59,940
Anyway, the point is ever since that big
dude with the hammer fell out of the sky.

1027
01:22:00,822 --> 01:22:02,623
Subtlety's kinda had its day.

1028
01:22:02,943 --> 01:22:04,503
What's next for you in your world?

1029
01:22:04,505 --> 01:22:09,347
Well, I wanted to repay you for the same
gift you so graciously imparted to me.

1030
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:21,672
Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not
sure if you can tell.

1031
01:22:22,194 --> 01:22:27,975
But at this moment the body is trying to decide
whether to accept Extremis or just give up.

1032
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:33,599
And if it gives up, I have to say the
denotation is quite spectacular.

1033
01:22:35,481 --> 01:22:38,203
But until that point, it's really
just a lot of pain.

1034
01:22:38,922 --> 01:22:42,606
We haven't even talked
salary yet.

1035
01:22:43,407 --> 01:22:46,292
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?

1036
01:22:46,393 --> 01:22:47,529
Let him go.

1037
01:22:49,288 --> 01:22:54,453
- Hold on, hold on. Maya
- I said let him go!

1038
01:22:55,134 --> 01:22:56,442
What are you doing?

1039
01:22:56,443 --> 01:22:59,615
1200ccs, a dose half of this
size and I'm dead.

1040
01:23:00,095 --> 01:23:03,739
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.

1041
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:05,819
Maya, give me the injector.

1042
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:11,262
If I die Killian, what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

1043
01:23:11,264 --> 01:23:12,462
We're not doing this, okay?

1044
01:23:12,463 --> 01:23:14,904
What happens to you? What happens
if you go too hot?

1045
01:23:28,432 --> 01:23:32,836
The good news is, a high level position
has just been vacated.

1046
01:23:41,061 --> 01:23:44,082
- You're a maniac.
- No, I'm a visionary.

1047
01:23:46,043 --> 01:23:50,605
But I do own a maniac, and he takes
the stage tonight.

1048
01:23:54,328 --> 01:23:57,971
When we get the Iron Patriot, it'll take
me nine to ten minutes for a take down.

1049
01:23:59,211 --> 01:24:01,931
That's great. The last time I looked
there was somebody inside of it.

1050
01:24:08,015 --> 01:24:09,658
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1051
01:24:12,698 --> 01:24:15,380
Hello Colonel.

1052
01:24:15,381 --> 01:24:17,021
Step aside.

1053
01:24:25,146 --> 01:24:27,909
We'll get you out of there,
don't worry.

1054
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:29,988
You'll damage the armor.

1055
01:24:30,469 --> 01:24:34,271
Yes, I will, but you can
fix it, right?

1056
01:24:35,152 --> 01:24:38,394
I'm going to take the suit up to base
camp, and I want Potts with me.

1057
01:24:38,994 --> 01:24:41,115
She's still in Phase 2.

1058
01:24:41,895 --> 01:24:44,417
You're not going deaf, are ya?

1059
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:01,967
Careful there, it's a limited edition.

1060
01:25:02,488 --> 01:25:04,729
Hey, uh, ponytail express.

1061
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:08,211
- What is the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?
- 832 miles.

1062
01:25:08,532 --> 01:25:10,573
Very nice.

1063
01:25:12,134 --> 01:25:14,654
- Are you gonna stop that?
- Break it you bought it.

1064
01:25:17,417 --> 01:25:20,612
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away, that
belongs to my friend's sister,

1065
01:25:20,613 --> 01:25:23,862
and that's why I'm gonna
kill you first.

1066
01:25:24,341 --> 01:25:25,462
- What're ya gonna do to me?
- You'll see.

1067
01:25:25,862 --> 01:25:29,384
- You're zip-tied to a bed.
- This.

1068
01:25:32,865 --> 01:25:34,306
That.

1069
01:25:38,628 --> 01:25:40,070
Are you comin' out?

1070
01:25:42,872 --> 01:25:47,033
Do not open, do not open, don't open,
don't open, don't. Alright, let's go.

1071
01:25:54,318 --> 01:25:57,041
You breathe fire? Okay.

1072
01:26:00,641 --> 01:26:03,644
It's a glorious day, Savin.

1073
01:26:03,963 --> 01:26:09,608
This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand.

1074
01:26:09,609 --> 01:26:12,809
And the world's most feared
terrorist in the other.

1075
01:26:13,649 --> 01:26:15,770
I'll own the War on Terror.

1076
01:26:17,252 --> 01:26:22,136
Creates supply and demand for you
and your brothers and sisters.

1077
01:26:25,296 --> 01:26:30,500
Trust me, you're going in a puddle of blood
on the ground in 5, 4, 3, Come on!, 2

1078
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:34,011
How did we get this shit?

1079
01:26:34,012 --> 01:26:36,893
Alright, I'm going to give you a chance to
escape, put down your weapons.

1080
01:26:37,863 --> 01:26:41,626
And tie yourselves into those chairs
and I'll let you live. In 5, 4

1081
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:46,360
You should be gone by now, you
should have already been gone.

1082
01:26:46,362 --> 01:26:47,470
I'm just beyond terrified.

1083
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:48,948
Here it comes.

1084
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:50,953
3, 4

1085
01:26:50,953 --> 01:26:52,953
- Shut up.
- 5..4..3..2..1.

1086
01:26:53,752 --> 01:26:54,953
I told you.

1087
01:27:07,921 --> 01:27:08,962
Where's the rest?

1088
01:28:06,234 --> 01:28:10,238
Honestly, I hate working here..
they are so weird.

1089
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:17,162
Better late than never.

1090
01:28:23,168 --> 01:28:24,929
Not this time. Not the face.

1091
01:28:26,787 --> 01:28:29,082
Phew, it's good to be back. Hello,
by the way.

1092
01:28:29,083 --> 01:28:29,878
Oh, hello sir.

1093
01:28:36,002 --> 01:28:38,315
All personnel, Stark is loose and
somewhere in the compound.

1094
01:28:38,317 --> 01:28:40,396
Repeat: Stark is loose and somewhere
in the compound.

1095
01:28:42,579 --> 01:28:44,140
Ah, crap.

1096
01:28:56,547 --> 01:28:59,127
- Tony.
- Rudy, tell me that was you in the suit.

1097
01:28:59,128 --> 01:29:00,408
No, you got yours?

1098
01:29:00,409 --> 01:29:03,712
Uh, um, kind of. Main house
as fast as you can.

1099
01:29:03,712 --> 01:29:04,993
Somebody I'd like you to meet.

1100
01:29:10,444 --> 01:29:12,466
You, you. Move!
Get out!

1101
01:29:12,466 --> 01:29:14,439
The room is secure. I have eyes
on the Mandarin.

1102
01:29:14,739 --> 01:29:16,948
What's this? I had winner's.

1103
01:29:25,347 --> 01:29:26,555
What've you come as?

1104
01:29:26,555 --> 01:29:28,791
Make a move and I'll break
your face.

1105
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:33,752
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

1106
01:29:34,434 --> 01:29:35,654
This is the Mandarin?

1107
01:29:35,655 --> 01:29:37,515
I know, it's, it's embarrassing.

1108
01:29:37,515 --> 01:29:39,476
Hi, I'm Trevor,
Trevor Slattery.

1109
01:29:39,478 --> 01:29:43,412
I know I'm shorter in person, I'm a bit
small, everyone says that but, uh, hey

1110
01:29:43,413 --> 01:29:46,960
if you're here to arrest me, there are
some people who I'd like to roll on.

1111
01:29:46,961 --> 01:29:48,140
Here's how it works,
Meryl Streep.

1112
01:29:48,141 --> 01:29:50,221
You tell him where Pepper
is and he'll stop doing it.

1113
01:29:50,601 --> 01:29:53,923
Doing what? Oh, I get it! Ow!
That hurt! I get it! I get it!

1114
01:29:53,925 --> 01:29:57,846
I do not know about any Pepper,
but I know the plan.

1115
01:29:57,847 --> 01:30:00,009
- Spill.
- Do you know what they did to my suit?

1116
01:30:00,368 --> 01:30:03,953
What? No. But I do know what's happening
off the coast.

1117
01:30:03,954 --> 01:30:07,731
Something to do with uh.. a big boat.
I can take you there.

1118
01:30:11,895 --> 01:30:14,417
Tony, I swear to God, I'm going
to blow his face off.

1119
01:30:14,417 --> 01:30:17,938
Oh this next bit may include the
Vice President as well.

1120
01:30:18,979 --> 01:30:20,734
- Is that important?
- Somewhat.

1121
01:30:20,735 --> 01:30:22,021
Yeah, a little bit.

1122
01:30:25,207 --> 01:30:26,912
- So?
- Uh, what are we gonna do.

1123
01:30:27,512 --> 01:30:30,729
We don't have any transport.

1124
01:30:31,752 --> 01:30:35,154
Hey, Ringo, didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1125
01:30:37,576 --> 01:30:40,024
If he's right about the location, we're
20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1126
01:30:40,025 --> 01:30:42,546
But we also have to figure out this
Vice President thing, right?

1127
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,561
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh, that's the Vice President.

1128
01:30:47,483 --> 01:30:50,002
- Hello.
- Sir, this is Tony Stark.

1129
01:30:50,685 --> 01:30:52,073
Welcome back to the land
of the living.

1130
01:30:52,073 --> 01:30:54,314
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign,

1131
01:30:54,314 --> 01:30:56,527
and we've got to get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1132
01:30:56,528 --> 01:31:01,211
Mr. Stark, I'm about to eat honey roast
ham surrounded by the agency's finest.

1133
01:31:01,212 --> 01:31:04,311
And the President is safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1134
01:31:04,412 --> 01:31:05,873
I think we're good here.

1135
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:07,814
Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes!

1136
01:31:07,954 --> 01:31:09,932
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a trojan horse.

1137
01:31:09,934 --> 01:31:10,796
They're gonna take out

1138
01:31:10,796 --> 01:31:13,457
the President somehow. We have to
immediately alert that plane.

1139
01:31:13,658 --> 01:31:16,158
Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security
lock it down. If need be,

1140
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:19,439
they can have F22s in the air in 30 seconds.
Thank you, Colonel.

1141
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:20,333
Rhodes and Stark out.

1142
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:23,560
Everything okay, sir?

1143
01:31:25,061 --> 01:31:26,585
Couldn't be better.

1144
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:35,930
I love you, baby.

1145
01:31:55,322 --> 01:31:58,382
Colonel Rhodes. Glad to see
you could make it, son.

1146
01:31:58,484 --> 01:31:59,565
I feel safer already.

1147
01:32:05,167 --> 01:32:06,448
We gotta make a decision.
We can either save

1148
01:32:06,449 --> 01:32:08,449
the President or Pepper.
We can't do both.

1149
01:32:08,670 --> 01:32:10,350
Sir, I have an update
from Malibu.

1150
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:12,556
The cranes have finally
arrived and the

1151
01:32:12,557 --> 01:32:14,654
cellar doors are being
cleared as we speak.

1152
01:32:15,213 --> 01:32:16,635
And what about the suit
I'm wearing?

1153
01:32:16,636 --> 01:32:18,336
The armor is now at 92%.

1154
01:32:19,395 --> 01:32:20,716
That's gonna have to do.

1155
01:32:30,382 --> 01:32:32,112
Oh, here he comes, here he comes,
get a quick picture.

1156
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:32,613
Sure.

1157
01:32:50,474 --> 01:32:52,396
Is everything all right,
Colonel?

1158
01:33:23,212 --> 01:33:25,775
It is an honor,
Mr. President.

1159
01:33:26,255 --> 01:33:28,596
If you're gonna do it, do it.

1160
01:33:28,796 --> 01:33:30,189
Whoa. Cool your boots, Sir.

1161
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:32,188
That's not how the
Mandarin works.

1162
01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:34,789
Sir. Air Force One's
been compromised.

1163
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:36,703
Internal shots, temperature
spikes.

1164
01:33:36,704 --> 01:33:37,867
Get me eyes on it now.

1165
01:33:37,868 --> 01:33:39,512
Image coming through now, Sir.

1166
01:33:42,195 --> 01:33:44,536
Is that Rhodes?

1167
01:34:12,853 --> 01:34:15,853
The President.
Now.

1168
01:34:16,335 --> 01:34:17,815
He's not here.

1169
01:34:21,338 --> 01:34:23,302
Try the jet stream.

1170
01:34:25,005 --> 01:34:27,100
Speaking of which, go fish!

1171
01:34:49,453 --> 01:34:51,895
Walk away from that, you
son of a bitch.

1172
01:35:04,563 --> 01:35:07,204
- How many in the air?
- Thirteen, sir.

1173
01:35:08,666 --> 01:35:10,466
- How many can I carry
- Four, sir.

1174
01:35:20,472 --> 01:35:23,735
Slow down, slow down. Relax, what's
your name? Heather..

1175
01:35:31,739 --> 01:35:34,274
Listen to me, see that guy?

1176
01:35:34,274 --> 01:35:35,693
I'm gonna swing by him

1177
01:35:35,694 --> 01:35:36,983
and you're just gonna grab him.

1178
01:35:36,984 --> 01:35:38,203
You got it?

1179
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:42,157
I will electrify your arm,

1180
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:43,926
you won't be able to open
your hand.

1181
01:35:45,351 --> 01:35:46,551
You can do this, Heather.

1182
01:35:55,372 --> 01:35:58,113
Easy, see? Eleven
more to go.

1183
01:36:00,975 --> 01:36:02,872
Remember that game called
Barrel of Monkeys?

1184
01:36:02,872 --> 01:36:04,179
That's what we're going to do.

1185
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:05,051
18,000 feet.

1186
01:36:05,652 --> 01:36:07,621
Come on, people! Everybody, grab
your monkey!

1187
01:36:12,301 --> 01:36:15,585
- Nice!
- 10,000 feet.

1188
01:36:18,827 --> 01:36:20,787
- 6,000 feet.
- Come on, people.

1189
01:36:21,628 --> 01:36:23,270
Come on, come on, come on

1190
01:36:27,113 --> 01:36:30,475
- Yeah!
- 1000 feet.

1191
01:36:31,994 --> 01:36:34,739
400 feet. 200 feet,
sir.

1192
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:36,618
It's a tricky monkey,
let's get him.

1193
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:38,719
Hello.

1194
01:37:01,212 --> 01:37:02,940
Nice work guys.
Excellent.

1195
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:05,333
Good team effort all around.
Go us.

1196
01:37:05,975 --> 01:37:08,695
Alright, Jarvis, but it's only half done,
we still gotta get Pepp..

1197
01:37:16,501 --> 01:37:19,023
That came out of nowhere.

1198
01:37:19,863 --> 01:37:20,779
Gimme some good news man.

1199
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:22,341
- I think they all made it.
- Thank God.

1200
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:24,344
Yeah, but I missed the President.

1201
01:37:24,746 --> 01:37:26,262
You couldn't save the President
with the suit,

1202
01:37:26,264 --> 01:37:27,864
how are you gonna save Pepper
without it?

1203
01:37:28,427 --> 01:37:30,359
Uh, say Jarvis, is it
that time?

1204
01:37:30,359 --> 01:37:32,470
The "house party"
protocol, sir?

1205
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:33,570
Correct.

1206
01:38:04,466 --> 01:38:06,345
Hi.

1207
01:38:12,751 --> 01:38:17,252
You think he's gonna help you..
he won't.

1208
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:24,813
Having you here is not just
to motivate Tony Stark,

1209
01:38:25,113 --> 01:38:28,180
it's actually more embarrassing
than that.

1210
01:38:28,878 --> 01:38:33,681
- You're here as my, um
- Trophy.

1211
01:38:45,649 --> 01:38:47,769
Good evening, sir.

1212
01:38:51,773 --> 01:38:53,694
Welcome aboard,
Mr. President.

1213
01:39:03,019 --> 01:39:05,743
You ever heard of an elephant
graveyard?

1214
01:39:05,744 --> 01:39:10,023
Well, two years ago, the elephant in
the room was this scow.

1215
01:39:12,774 --> 01:39:13,774
This is the Roxxon Norco.

1216
01:39:14,033 --> 01:39:17,494
Of course you remember when she spilled 100
million gallons of crude off Pensacola.

1217
01:39:17,496 --> 01:39:20,057
Thanks to you, not one fat
cat saw a day in court.

1218
01:39:20,637 --> 01:39:21,958
What do you want from me?

1219
01:39:23,159 --> 01:39:24,939
Uh, nothing, sir.

1220
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:28,064
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.

1221
01:39:28,631 --> 01:39:33,194
You see, I've moved on. I've found myself
a new political patron, and

1222
01:39:33,414 --> 01:39:35,895
At this time tomorrow, he'll
have your job.

1223
01:39:37,596 --> 01:39:39,297
String him up.

1224
01:39:57,868 --> 01:39:59,130
Come on.

1225
01:40:03,591 --> 01:40:05,354
You're not gonna freak out
on me, right?

1226
01:40:05,354 --> 01:40:05,913
I hope not.

1227
01:40:32,009 --> 01:40:33,550
Oh my God.

1228
01:40:35,032 --> 01:40:37,399
He's strung up over the oil tank, they're
gonna light him up, man.

1229
01:40:37,399 --> 01:40:38,453
Viking funeral.

1230
01:40:38,912 --> 01:40:41,675
- Public execution.
- Yeah, death by oil.

1231
01:40:47,957 --> 01:40:51,038
Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.

1232
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:53,387
Okay, that's good.

1233
01:40:53,389 --> 01:40:56,261
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

1234
01:40:58,345 --> 01:40:59,431
Is your gun up?

1235
01:40:59,856 --> 01:41:01,350
Yup, what do I do?

1236
01:41:01,351 --> 01:41:04,081
Stay on my six, cover high, and don't
shoot me in the back.

1237
01:41:04,082 --> 01:41:05,453
Six, high, back. Alright.

1238
01:41:15,613 --> 01:41:16,716
You see that? Nailed it.

1239
01:41:16,716 --> 01:41:18,416
Yeah, you really killed
the glass.

1240
01:41:18,417 --> 01:41:19,533
I was aiming for the bulb?

1241
01:41:19,534 --> 01:41:21,095
You can't hit a bulb from
this distance.

1242
01:41:25,698 --> 01:41:28,024
I'm out. Gimme, gimme, you got
an extra magazine?

1243
01:41:28,025 --> 01:41:29,300
They're not universal, Tony.

1244
01:41:29,622 --> 01:41:30,930
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Gimme another one.

1245
01:41:31,793 --> 01:41:33,385
I don't have one that
fits that gun.

1246
01:41:33,564 --> 01:41:34,087
You've got like five of them.

1247
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:36,329
Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna spot. Ready?

1248
01:41:37,247 --> 01:41:38,492
What'd you see?

1249
01:41:38,493 --> 01:41:41,208
Too fast, nothing.
Here we go.

1250
01:41:45,551 --> 01:41:47,512
Three guys, one girl,
all armed.

1251
01:41:57,466 --> 01:41:59,162
God, I'd kill for some
armor right now.

1252
01:41:59,162 --> 01:42:01,069
- You're right, we need backup.
- Yeah, much.

1253
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:04,369
You know what?

1254
01:42:07,832 --> 01:42:09,394
- Is that?
- Yep.

1255
01:42:10,876 --> 01:42:11,994
- Are those?
- Yeah.

1256
01:42:29,324 --> 01:42:30,765
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1257
01:42:35,929 --> 01:42:38,311
Jarvis, target Extremis heat
signatures.

1258
01:42:38,313 --> 01:42:40,100
Disable with extreme prejudice.

1259
01:42:40,201 --> 01:42:41,573
Yes, sir.

1260
01:42:46,135 --> 01:42:49,216
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.

1261
01:42:50,778 --> 01:42:51,578
Take 'em to church.

1262
01:43:13,192 --> 01:43:15,212
Jarvis, get Igor to steady
this thing.

1263
01:43:27,479 --> 01:43:29,627
This is how you've been managing
your downtime, huh?

1264
01:43:29,628 --> 01:43:30,680
Everybody needs a hobby.

1265
01:43:37,045 --> 01:43:39,086
Heartbreaker? Help Red Snapper
out, will ya?

1266
01:44:07,344 --> 01:44:07,895
Nice timing.

1267
01:44:07,896 --> 01:44:10,104
Oh yeah, that's awesome. Give me
a suit, okay?

1268
01:44:12,266 --> 01:44:14,067
Oh, I'm sorry. They're
only coded to me.

1269
01:44:14,466 --> 01:44:15,253
What's that mean?

1270
01:44:15,255 --> 01:44:16,228
I got you covered.

1271
01:44:19,949 --> 01:44:23,152
- Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?
- Very funny.

1272
01:44:40,962 --> 01:44:43,244
- Sir, I've located Miss Potts.
- About time.

1273
01:44:56,051 --> 01:44:58,974
Stop, put it down, put it
down, put it down.

1274
01:45:01,613 --> 01:45:03,895
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?

1275
01:45:06,497 --> 01:45:07,365
You're such a jerk.

1276
01:45:07,367 --> 01:45:08,979
Yup, we'll talk about
it at dinner.

1277
01:45:10,819 --> 01:45:13,541
Come on, a little more, baby.

1278
01:45:29,390 --> 01:45:30,832
Is this guy bothering you?

1279
01:45:32,391 --> 01:45:35,114
Don't get up!

1280
01:45:38,115 --> 01:45:40,077
Is it hot there?

1281
01:45:41,438 --> 01:45:43,118
Stuck? Feel a little stuck?

1282
01:45:44,118 --> 01:45:47,400
Like a little turtle, cooking in
his little turtle suit?

1283
01:45:48,001 --> 01:45:49,601
Tony..

1284
01:45:49,603 --> 01:45:51,243
She's watching.

1285
01:45:52,444 --> 01:45:53,966
I think you should close
your eyes.

1286
01:45:53,966 --> 01:45:54,966
Close your eyes.

1287
01:45:55,565 --> 01:45:58,528
Close your eyes. You don't
want to see this.

1288
01:46:05,972 --> 01:46:07,493
Yeah, you take a minute.

1289
01:46:40,551 --> 01:46:42,234
Jarvis, give me a suit
right now!

1290
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:54,800
Aw, come on!

1291
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:59,162
Mr. President! Just hold on,
alright? I'm coming.

1292
01:47:00,444 --> 01:47:02,685
Just hold on.
Hold on.

1293
01:47:24,497 --> 01:47:25,957
Buh-bye.

1294
01:47:37,664 --> 01:47:39,426
Brace yourself!

1295
01:47:49,912 --> 01:47:53,595
You look damn good, Mr. President, but
I'm gonna need that suit back.

1296
01:48:06,682 --> 01:48:08,764
The President is secure, Tony.
I'm clearing the area.

1297
01:48:08,765 --> 01:48:09,779
Nice work.

1298
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,125
- Ready sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?

1299
01:48:21,091 --> 01:48:25,332
Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you.
Just look at me.

1300
01:48:27,213 --> 01:48:29,811
Honey, I can't reach any further, and
you can't stay there, alright?

1301
01:48:29,813 --> 01:48:30,935
You gotta let go.

1302
01:48:30,935 --> 01:48:33,738
You gotta let go. I'll catch
you, I promise.

1303
01:49:04,235 --> 01:49:08,118
What a shame, I would
have caught her.

1304
01:49:38,429 --> 01:49:39,529
Eject.

1305
01:50:25,203 --> 01:50:27,645
Well here we are, on the roof.

1306
01:50:38,011 --> 01:50:39,811
- Mark 42 inbound.
- Well I'll be damned.

1307
01:50:40,612 --> 01:50:42,172
The prodigal son returns.

1308
01:50:58,342 --> 01:50:59,502
Whatever.

1309
01:51:00,503 --> 01:51:02,384
You really didn't deserve
her, Tony.

1310
01:51:03,627 --> 01:51:07,387
It's a pity. I was so close to having
her.. perfect.

1311
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:12,475
Okay, okay, wait, wait, slow down,
slow down.

1312
01:51:12,777 --> 01:51:14,712
You're right. I don't
deserve her.

1313
01:51:15,993 --> 01:51:17,514
But here's where you're wrong.

1314
01:51:18,234 --> 01:51:20,595
She was already perfect.

1315
01:51:27,158 --> 01:51:31,581
Jarvis, do me a favor and
blow Mark 42.

1316
01:51:31,703 --> 01:51:35,618
No..!!

1317
01:52:47,046 --> 01:52:49,006
No more false faces.

1318
01:52:49,587 --> 01:52:51,987
You said you wanted
the Mandarin.

1319
01:52:52,587 --> 01:52:54,690
You're looking right at him.

1320
01:52:55,692 --> 01:52:59,130
It was always me, Tony, right
from the start.

1321
01:52:59,331 --> 01:53:00,873
I am the Mandarin!

1322
01:53:12,341 --> 01:53:14,061
I got nothing.

1323
01:53:19,904 --> 01:53:23,067
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

1324
01:53:31,631 --> 01:53:33,672
What? Oh what, are
you mad at me?

1325
01:53:59,047 --> 01:54:00,309
Honey.

1326
01:54:04,971 --> 01:54:06,231
Oh my God.

1327
01:54:07,632 --> 01:54:10,114
I was really violent.

1328
01:54:10,875 --> 01:54:13,409
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were

1329
01:54:13,411 --> 01:54:15,818
I was dead. Why? Because I
fell two hundred feet?

1330
01:54:18,579 --> 01:54:22,523
- Who's the hot mess now?
- Still debatable.

1331
01:54:23,582 --> 01:54:24,752
Probably tipping your way
a little bit.

1332
01:54:24,752 --> 01:54:26,233
Why don't you dress like
this at home?

1333
01:54:26,425 --> 01:54:28,425
Hmm? Sports bra, the
whole deal.

1334
01:54:28,765 --> 01:54:31,966
You know I think I understand why you
don't want to give up the suits.

1335
01:54:32,548 --> 01:54:34,509
What I am gonna complain
about now?

1336
01:54:35,868 --> 01:54:39,350
Well, it's me. I'll think
of something.

1337
01:54:40,953 --> 01:54:43,993
- Don't touch me. No, I'm gonna burn you!
- No, no.

1338
01:54:45,136 --> 01:54:46,735
You're not hot.

1339
01:54:47,756 --> 01:54:49,438
Am I gonna be okay?

1340
01:54:49,439 --> 01:54:52,600
No, you're in a relationship with me,
everything will never be okay.

1341
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,440
But I think I can figure
this out, yeah.

1342
01:54:55,442 --> 01:54:59,925
I almost had this 20 years ago when I was
drunk. I think I can get you better.

1343
01:55:01,082 --> 01:55:02,685
That's what I do.
I fix things.

1344
01:55:03,926 --> 01:55:06,127
And all your distractions?

1345
01:55:06,528 --> 01:55:08,769
Uh, I'm gonna shave them
down a little bit.

1346
01:55:08,770 --> 01:55:12,315
- Jarvis, hey.
- All wrapped up here, sir.

1347
01:55:12,317 --> 01:55:14,771
Will there be anything else?

1348
01:55:14,773 --> 01:55:15,773
You know what to do.

1349
01:55:16,472 --> 01:55:19,255
The "clean slate" protocol,
sir?

1350
01:55:19,256 --> 01:55:22,556
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

1351
01:55:59,198 --> 01:56:01,300
Okay so far?
You like it?

1352
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,881
It'll do.

1353
01:56:12,845 --> 01:56:17,769
<i>And so, as Christmas morning began, my
journey had reached its end.</i>

1354
01:56:22,171 --> 01:56:26,453
<i>You start with something pure,
something exciting.</i>

1355
01:56:27,135 --> 01:56:29,895
<i>Then come the mistakes.</i>

1356
01:56:30,657 --> 01:56:32,578
<i>The compromises.</i>

1357
01:56:38,860 --> 01:56:41,222
<i>"We create our own Demons".</i>

1358
01:56:46,787 --> 01:56:48,787
It's great to see you.

1359
01:56:50,188 --> 01:56:51,886
<i>As promised, I get Pepper sorted down</i>

1360
01:56:51,970 --> 01:56:53,694
<i>Took some angry..</i>

1361
01:56:54,712 --> 01:56:56,811
<i>and then I talk to myself,
way stop there.</i>

1362
01:57:02,136 --> 01:57:04,840
<i>Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous.</i>

1363
01:57:05,338 --> 01:57:08,740
<i>But I'll bet none of those idiots ever had
to live with a chest full of shrapnel.</i>

1364
01:57:09,301 --> 01:57:12,203
<i>And now.. neither will I.</i>

1365
01:57:13,222 --> 01:57:16,984
<i>Let me tell you, that was the best
sleep I'd had in years.</i>

1366
01:57:38,009 --> 01:57:41,770
- It's okay, it's okay.
- No!

1367
01:58:59,537 --> 01:59:03,060
<i>So if I were to wrap this up tight
with a bow or whatever.</i>

1368
01:59:03,217 --> 01:59:09,643
<i>I guess I'd say my armor was never
a distraction or a hobby.</i>

1369
01:59:10,163 --> 01:59:12,083
<i>It was a cocoon.</i>

1370
01:59:13,104 --> 01:59:18,106
<i>And now, I'm a changed man.</i>

1371
01:59:27,154 --> 01:59:29,333
<i>You can take away my house,</i>

1372
01:59:29,734 --> 01:59:31,173
<i>All my tricks and toys.</i>

1373
01:59:31,755 --> 01:59:33,957
<i>One thing you can't take away..</i>

1374
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:39,220
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1375
02:09:05,413 --> 02:09:07,716
You know, and thank you, by
the way, for listening.

1376
02:09:07,716 --> 02:09:10,704
There's just something about getting
it off my chest and putting

1377
02:09:10,706 --> 02:09:13,418
it out there in the atmosphere
instead of holding this in.

1378
02:09:13,748 --> 02:09:16,650
I mean, this is what gets people
sick, you know?

1379
02:09:16,850 --> 02:09:19,752
Wow, I had no idea you were
such a good listener.

1380
02:09:19,853 --> 02:09:23,462
To be able to share all of my intimate
thoughts and my experiences

1381
02:09:23,463 --> 02:09:26,756
with someone, it just cuts the weight
of it in half, you know.

1382
02:09:26,757 --> 02:09:28,112
It's like a snake swallowing
its own tail.

1383
02:09:28,213 --> 02:09:29,373
Everything comes full circle.

1384
02:09:29,658 --> 02:09:32,560
And.. and the fact that you've been
able to help me process..

1385
02:09:35,131 --> 02:09:36,532
- So, uh..?
- You with me?

1386
02:09:36,533 --> 02:09:38,734
I was, yeah. Mm..hmm. We were..
uh, we were at, uh..

1387
02:09:38,734 --> 02:09:40,134
You actively napping?

1388
02:09:40,135 --> 02:09:42,536
I..I was.. I.. I..
I drifted.

1389
02:09:42,836 --> 02:09:44,136
Where did I lose you?

1390
02:09:45,938 --> 02:09:48,238
Elevator in Switzerland.

1391
02:09:49,039 --> 02:09:50,340
So you heard none of it?

1392
02:09:50,841 --> 02:09:54,063
I'm sorry, I'm not that
kind of doctor.

1393
02:09:54,064 --> 02:09:56,743
I'm not a therapist, it's not
my training.

1394
02:09:56,744 --> 02:09:58,145
- So?
- I don't have the..

1395
02:09:58,244 --> 02:10:00,846
- What? The time?
- Temperament.

1396
02:10:00,947 --> 02:10:02,981
You know what? Now that I
think about it,

1397
02:10:02,983 --> 02:10:06,199
Oh God, my original wound.
1983, alright?

1398
02:10:06,201 --> 02:10:07,250
Yes.

1399
02:10:07,251 --> 02:10:09,300
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny?
That was weird.

1400
