1
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:31,177
During the nation's early years, powers compete to conquer China,
each furthering their own military reach and empire.
Warlords big and small side with foreigners at the expense of the people.
Endless battles turn the land into hell on earth.

2
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:40,669
Dengfeng, Henan.

3
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,420
Amitabha.

4
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,210
Amitabha.

5
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,180
Brother, we have a live one here.

6
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,690
Wake up!

7
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,990
Wake up!

8
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,200
Quickly! Don't let them escape!

9
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,210
After them!

10
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,700
Kill! Leave not one!

11
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,670
Sir, eat it slowly.

12
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,850
Eat it while it's hot.

13
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,680
Thank you.

14
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,680
Brother, yet another two hundred arrive.

15
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,450
Jingkong, winter will come soon.

16
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,460
Before the blizzards reach the mountain,
we must build more shelters.

17
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,420
We've already run out of wood and straw.

18
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,930
What else do you want me to build with?

19
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,190
Then take what we can out of our rooms
and give it to these people.

20
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,700
No way, I am deathly afraid of the cold.

21
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,490
Look at these mantou,
each day it gets smaller and smaller.

22
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,310
So we needn't worry about freezing to death.

23
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,310
Even before winter arrives,

24
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,940
You will have already starved to death.

25
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,989
After him!

26
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,913
Search!

27
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,820
Come out!

28
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,190
Out of the way! Bring him out!

29
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:08,037
- Stop!
- Don't move!

30
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,113
- You! Over here!
- Stop! Don't move!

31
00:06:12,148 --> 00:06:13,509
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

32
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:25,481
Out of the way!

33
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,482
Out of the way!

34
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,870
You can't enter!

35
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Stop!

36
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,900
You can't enter!

37
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,800
Off the horse!

38
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,700
Off the horse!

39
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,990
Abbot, save me.

40
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,260
Stinkin' monks!

41
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,760
Commander Hou wants this man's head!
Those who harbour him will share in his crime!

42
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,500
I don't care who you are!
You will not disturb these grounds!

43
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,320
Come then.

44
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,960
Hey! Hey!

45
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,730
Save him and I'll send you
to meet the Buddha.

46
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,730
He's lost a lot of blood.

47
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,230
Quickly, get the haemostatic powder.

48
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,050
Yes, Abbot.

49
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,840
Commander Hou arrives!

50
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,020
These people have welcomed you
with a display of their Shaolin kungfu.

51
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,230
And you reply with guns?
You are without manners.

52
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,500
Commander Hou.

53
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,520
Sir, please don't move.

54
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,620
Abbot, you also don't move.

55
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,550
He's nearing death.

56
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,390
Help him, send him off.

57
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,960
Amitabha.

58
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,390
Buddha sends the fated.

59
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,060
He has arrived,
even if it is on his last breath,

60
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,030
I must still help him.

61
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,270
I ask sir to show compassion.

62
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,540
No more meaningless deaths.

63
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,040
If he doesn't die,
I will not sleep easy.

64
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,780
When the heart is removed from dread,
dreams will no longer be troubled.

65
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,920
With a benevolent heart,
everywhere you go will be the Pure Land.

66
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,320
The Pure Land?

67
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,160
Abbot, you've stayed at Shaolin temple
for far too long, you're confused.

68
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,560
If I don't kill him,
the fighting will continue.

69
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,230
This will mean more killing.

70
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,300
How will we reach the Pure Land then?

71
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,170
Hou Jie.

72
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,840
I admit defeat.

73
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,610
Dengfeng City is already yours.

74
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,810
If you spare me...

75
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,450
I will give all my wealth and money to you.

76
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:14,326
This...

77
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,387
Is the gold I buried.

78
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:19,873
Take it.

79
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,798
If you don't kill me, I promise...

80
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,470
I will never return.

81
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,726
Thank you, Abbot.

82
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,208
- Abbot!
- Abbot!

83
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,740
Sir!

84
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,459
Sir!

85
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:18,174
Defend the temple!

86
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,290
Jingneng, Jingkong, stand down.

87
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,540
A joyous arrival to a sad departure...

88
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,350
The void in our world is once again felt.

89
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,850
Would it not have been better
to have not come and gone...

90
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,720
To be free from happiness and sadness?

91
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,990
Amitabha.

92
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,120
Go.

93
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:12,608
[ PLAQUE: The Source of All Martial Arts ]
[ GRAFFITI : Empty words. ]

94
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,030
Big brother,
we are meeting with the foreigners tomorrow.

95
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,930
What for?

96
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,500
With proper funding,
we can buy many machine guns and cannons.

97
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,670
With it, we can take Zhengzhou.

98
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,000
More guns is good, but useless if you dont fire them.

99
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,010
Tell me, back at Shaolin, why didn't you fire?

100
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,280
Compassion?

101
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,520
Remember this, when you gain the upper hand...

102
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,820
And you hesitate a moment too long...

103
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,960
The one dead will be you.

104
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,200
Next time...

105
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,390
The next time I come across someone
standing in Brother's way...

106
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,460
I will definitely kill him.

107
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,750
Then you've learned.

108
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,470
Song Hu has already arrived.

109
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,010
That's "Commander Song".

110
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,080
Commander Song.

111
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,850
The bastard, we fight without
seeing any of his men.

112
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,350
But come time to divide the spoils,
he's here ever so quickly.

113
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,760
Brother Hu, Dengfeng City has been taken.

114
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Huo Long is dead.

115
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,230
For a nobody such as Huo Long...

116
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,870
Why such a commotion?

117
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,100
I would think you were still
seeing the coffin off.

118
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,610
We are in rememberance of the
hundreds of brothers lost.

119
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,510
Is that so?

120
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,080
I am in your debt then.

121
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,120
Against Huo Long,
I didn't come, not to take advantage of you...

122
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,790
If it weren't for these two bum legs...

123
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,120
My horse and gun alone would
have been enough to sort him out.

124
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,590
Isn't that right, brother?

125
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,490
Of course...

126
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,530
What is a little loss on my part?
I do not fret.

127
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,630
I know that.
You fret because of DengFeng City.

128
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,410
Sister-in-law, it's been too long.

129
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:05,980
Big brother.

130
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,110
Shengnan, my darling girl.

131
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,780
Greet your Uncle Song.

132
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,120
Hello, Uncle Song.

133
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,290
Hello, Nan-Nan.

134
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,120
Sister, your Nan-nan is
growing up to be very polite.

135
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,660
More beautiful with age.

136
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,430
With a daughter like her,
be careful someone doesn't steal her away.

137
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,660
It's decided,
this child will be one of the family.

138
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,200
My future daughter-in-law.

139
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,440
When was this arranged?

140
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,070
It doesn't matter, now is all the same.

141
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,110
What? You disagree?

142
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,450
If you disagree then let's fight.

143
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,120
Good.

144
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,690
Good gun.

145
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,060
This is a fully automatic weapon.

146
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,790
You can't buy it anywhere else.

147
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:28,900
We want eighty units.

148
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,300
How shall we do this?

149
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,540
I wonâ€™t take a penny if...

150
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,410
General Hou supports our railway into Dengfeng.

151
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,220
What did you say?
I didn't hear properly.

152
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,230
I said, I won't take a penny...

153
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,070
If you support the building of our railway.

154
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,200
I don't want the guns anymore.

155
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,770
General.

156
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,240
I don't want the guns anymore!

157
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,210
Go, we head to the city's east.

158
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,620
I believe, General Song Hu
will show more interest.

159
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,360
Mr Peter, please wait.

160
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,360
Brother, this gun is truly marvellous.

161
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,870
If Song Hu takes them...

162
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,470
Show them out!

163
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,870
Yes!

164
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,710
Please.

165
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,650
Next time, choose your words carefully
when you speak to me.

166
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,408
I don't take orders from you.

167
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,120
Maybe when you're in my position, then we'll talk.

168
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,990
You hear what I'm saying?

169
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,900
Am I being clear enough?

170
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,690
To use the lives of our countrymen
and take the wealth of the people.

171
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,190
Agreeing to build their railway...

172
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,660
Is like opening the doors for them to take our land.

173
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,040
The land of the Chinese
belongs to the people of China.

174
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,200
The foreigners' hands reach to take it...

175
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,440
I will chop them all off.

176
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,180
I hope Song Hu feels the same.

177
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,680
I don't think you've listened to what I've said.

178
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,460
These twenty years, I've called him brother.

179
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,330
Do not badmouth him.

180
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,370
And even if he is bad,
it is not for you to say!

181
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,150
I'm dizzy.

182
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,090
What the hell are you doing?

183
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,290
Eating biscuits.

184
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,300
Biscuits?

185
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,560
I'm eating noodles now.

186
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,200
You've gone mad from hunger.

187
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,800
What do you know?
This is called having an idea.

188
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,810
Idea? Having an idea?
All you know is having ideas.

189
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,480
You might be able to do that,
But how about the people out there?

190
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,680
What can they do?

191
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,480
In times of famine, Judge Bao
would feed the people with his own stores.

192
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,190
What if we became masked avengers?

193
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,620
We'll hit back at the warlords' armies.

194
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,830
Brother,
why don't we become masked avengers?

195
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,190
Masked avengers?

196
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,630
That's right,
we'll become avengers that save people.

197
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,030
Brother, that's against the rules.

198
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,370
What are you afraid of?

199
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,470
When the sky falls,
Second Brother will hold it up.

200
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,970
Brother is most generous, am I right?

201
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,640
Of course.

202
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,140
Of course! Of course!

203
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,350
Little Miss, please don't run.

204
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,800
- Quickly get up
- Shengnan!

205
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,620
Are you injured?

206
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,530
What the hell are you doing?
Did I not tell you to hold her hand!?

207
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,700
- I'm sorry.
- Why didn't you watch her!?

208
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,800
- I'm sorry, Master.
- You want to die!?

209
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
- I'm sorry.
- Papa.

210
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,500
It doesn't hurt anymore,
please don't be angry with her.

211
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,870
I'm sorry, Master. I'm sorry.

212
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,170
Leave us.

213
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,570
- Does it hurt?
- How does it feel?

214
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
I'm not hurt

215
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,680
Are there any injuries?

216
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,080
- Let Papa see.
- Papa.

217
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,780
I made a drawing for you.

218
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,900
[My daddy likes fighting]

219
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,600
Is this Papa?

220
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,160
Here, Papa will carry you.

221
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,700
Hold on.

222
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,800
Is Papa this mean?

223
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:45,870
Big brother.

224
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,040
Hold it for now, give it to me later.

225
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,060
Ive personally delivered the
marriage contract to Commander Song.

226
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,590
He was very happy.

227
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,230
Tomorrow night, Zhongyue Restaurant.

228
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,730
Commander Song and wife, their son.

229
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,940
Eating begins on the dot.

230
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,120
I want to ask you a question.

231
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,590
Since Song Hu already knows
that I have Huo Long's gold...

232
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,760
Why does he not ask me about it?

233
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,630
He wants it all.

234
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,110
Including DengFeng City.

235
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,350
The one who strikes first wins.

236
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,150
Then this is a good opportunity.

237
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,260
Correct.

238
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,490
Pick thirty of your finest and
make preparations at the Zhongyue Restaurant.

239
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,510
If he's not dead, I can't sleep.

240
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,680
Big brother is wise.

241
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,900
You want to kill Brother Song?

242
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,570
It would be better if you didn't know.

243
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,840
Be he is your brother.

244
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,310
Please think again.

245
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,080
Song Hu wants to take me down.

246
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,090
Do you have any other solution?

247
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,920
Spit it out now, it's not too late.

248
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,590
Don't ask me, I don't know.

249
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,100
I only have just one request...

250
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,440
Don't let your daughter see it.

251
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,110
Okay?

252
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,620
A mouse?

253
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,160
Brother, once we've stolen the rice,
how about noodles next?

254
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,000
Could you not call it "stealing"?
We are "taking".

255
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,530
Then how much are we "taking"?

256
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,200
A bag we'll take,
two bags we'll also take.

257
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,070
Take however much we can.

258
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,170
Jinghai.

259
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,310
As masked avengers, we should leave a calling card.

260
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,510
What should we use?

261
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,140
How about your shiny head?

262
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,140
You!

263
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,800
Rice.

264
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,540
Son, we have rice.

265
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,470
Brother, its rice!

266
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,710
The gods have opened their eyes.

267
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,750
Thank you! Thank you!

268
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,180
There's rice!

269
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,240
Wait until I knock on the table...

270
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,270
You take our daughter to the toilets.

271
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,240
Papa, we are here to eat.
Why do we need to go to the toilets?

272
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,910
Listen to Papa now...

273
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,410
And Papa will listen to you one day.
Don't argue.

274
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,230
Please.

275
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,470
This way.

276
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,900
Big Brother.

277
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,700
Sister.

278
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,400
Brother, you're late again.

279
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,660
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

280
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,660
Say hello.

281
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,670
Hello, Uncle Song.
Hello, Auntie.

282
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,800
Wanshan, greet Uncle and Auntie.

283
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,140
Uncle.

284
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,340
Auntie.

285
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,800
Well behaved.

286
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,800
Really well behaved.

287
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,680
Sirs.

288
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,080
The Song family's Young Master
was born in the year of the rabbit.

289
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,650
The Hou family's Little Miss
was born in the year of the sheep.

290
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,150
A great match.

291
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:45,420
Moreover, their dates of birth
are very auspicious.

292
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,660
Their five elements complimenting,
fortunes will equally flourish.

293
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,330
A match made in heaven.

294
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,830
I dare say, this match will bring
wealth and fortune to both families.

295
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,470
Together till their hair turns grey.

296
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,940
Thereafter, a hundred children and
a thousand grandchildren.

297
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,940
Great, great.

298
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,180
Actually, as Buddhists we talk about
fate being the cause of all things.

299
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,250
Without fate, things do not converge.

300
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,050
With fate, I believe...

301
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,050
They would have come together sooner or later.

302
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,350
So what are we waiting for?

303
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,190
Quick, quick, quick!
On with the wedding invitations!

304
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,360
What are you so anxious about?

305
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,560
How can I not be?

306
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,960
If I were to lose such a
wonderful daughter-in-law...

307
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,500
Where would I find another one?

308
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,870
Sirs, please exchange invitations.

309
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,370
This betrothal is finalised.

310
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,970
Agreed!

311
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:34,870
Here.

312
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,970
Congratulations! Congratulations!

313
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,210
Big brother,
I'll go settle the marriage rites.

314
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,770
Brother, now that we are one family...

315
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,770
I can speak my mind.

316
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,200
Speak.

317
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,250
How are we going to split Dengfeng City...

318
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,280
Between the two of us?

319
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,420
You tell me.

320
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,430
Didn't we already settle this?
One man, one half.

321
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,630
It's all yours.

322
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,810
From today on, Dengfeng City
is not split between you and me.

323
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,280
Only one person will have all the say.

324
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,810
This is the most peaceful solution.

325
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,420
What do you mean by this?

326
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,950
Brother, I am getting old.

327
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,660
I can't fight any more.

328
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,860
Look at this leg, acting up again.

329
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,460
It's time for me to retire.

330
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,470
What's more, we're family now.

331
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,300
Even if I give it to you today...

332
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,870
In the future, will it not be left to my son?

333
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,340
I've thought it through, I don't lose out.

334
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,950
I've held this wine for many years
but could never bring myself to open it.

335
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,020
But today I will.
Here, drink!

336
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,490
Drink up and this matter is settled.

337
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,190
Commander, we've received a secret message.

338
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,350
Son, do you need to go pee?

339
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,150
No need.

340
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,550
Listen to me, ask your mother
to take you to the toilets.

341
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,520
Sister, take Shengnan as well.

342
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:10,890
Let's go.

343
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,130
Run.

344
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,200
- Vice Wang.
- Here!

345
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,380
Leave us.

346
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,380
Yes.

347
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,906
[ NOTE: General, be careful. ]
[ Hou Jie has an ambush ]

348
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:05,950
You!

349
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,680
You bastard!

350
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,690
I've always treated you as my own brother.

351
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,790
We conquered the world together.

352
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,790
I would never have thought,
today you wanted to kill me.

353
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,190
- Is this true!?
- Enough!

354
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,220
Shengnan!

355
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,720
Mama!

356
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,630
Mama come quickly!

357
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,280
Go already.

358
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,540
Mama, save me!

359
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,050
Mama.

360
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,100
Mama! Mama.

361
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,870
Mama.

362
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,070
Shengnan!
Get out of here, Shengnan!

363
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,470
- Mama.
- Run quickly!

364
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,470
Shengnan! Run quickly!

365
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,740
Run away, Shengnan! Don't look back!

366
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,640
Shengnan...

367
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,040
General!

368
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,310
Papa! Papa!

369
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,580
Shengnan!

370
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,320
Stop!

371
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:09,650
Commander! Run!

372
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:10,868
Run!

373
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,870
Shengnan!

374
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:42,898
- Shengnan.
- Papa.

375
00:37:44,614 --> 00:37:45,713
Over there!

376
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,534
Kill!

377
00:39:02,377 --> 00:39:03,324
Shengnan, don't be afraid!

378
00:39:56,054 --> 00:39:58,180
Papa... Papa...

379
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:05,644
Papa...

380
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,143
Shengnan!

381
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,930
Abbot!

382
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,970
Sir! Sir!

383
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,670
Please slow down!

384
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,810
Save her!
Abbot! Save her!

385
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,440
Save her.

386
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,450
Save her! Save her!

387
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,310
Quick! Save her!

388
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,450
Make way! Quickly!

389
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,350
Silver needles! Guanyin paste! Hot water!

390
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,390
Yes!

391
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,190
Hurry!

392
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,130
Shengnan, it'll be alright, it'll be alright.

393
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,840
Shengnan, don't fall asleep.
Wake up.

394
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,000
Madam!

395
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,710
Madam! You are not yet healed! You mustn't run!

396
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,710
Please be careful.

397
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,710
Shengnan

398
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,220
Shengnan, be good.

399
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,510
Shengnan.

400
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:44,180
Say something to Papa,
Say something to Papa.

401
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:47,510
Shengnan, say something to Papa.

402
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,280
Shengnan, say something.

403
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,190
Why did you stop? You can't stop!

404
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,890
Hurry up and save her!

405
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,760
Do you want me to beg?

406
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,200
Then I'll beg!
Save her! Save her!

407
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,230
Papa...

408
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,270
Papa, don't scold them.

409
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,270
And don't be angry with them.

410
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,410
Papa will listen.

411
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,410
Papa will listen! Papa will listen!

412
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:17,180
I beg of you.

413
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:17,910
Shengnan!

414
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:18,760
- I beg of you.
- Shengnan.

415
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:19,950
Mama...

416
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,780
Shengnan!

417
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,920
She's going to be okay.

418
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,620
- Mama, I missed you.
- She's alright!

419
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:33,230
Mama, let's go home together.

420
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,600
Shengnan, wake up.

421
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,200
Save her.

422
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,300
I'm begging all of you.

423
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,470
Only you can save her.

424
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,800
Shengnan, wake up.

425
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,240
Say something to Mama, Shengnan.

426
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,440
Shengnan.

427
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,610
Shengnan!

428
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,280
Shengnan!

429
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,490
She's alright.

430
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,460
Say something to Papa, say something to Papa.

431
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,520
- She's fine.
- Shengnan!

432
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:05,860
She can't be dead.

433
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,630
Shengnan! Shengnan!

434
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,130
Please wake up, you can't die.

435
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,840
Shengnan can't die.

436
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,470
Mama is here, look at Mama.

437
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,010
Jinghai, receive the body.

438
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,710
- Yes.
- She can't be dead!

439
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,850
I beg you! Save her!

440
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:26,780
I beg you.

441
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,650
I beg you. Save her.

442
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,560
Quickly save her.
Abbot have compassion, save her!

443
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:41,360
If you can't save her, I'll tell you now!

444
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,030
Don't none of you ever think of living!

445
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,370
I will burn Shaolin temple to the ground!

446
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:48,770
- Abbot, save her!
- Enough!

447
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,300
Amitabha.

448
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,810
Have the gods not yet punished you enough!?

449
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:56,310
It's your fault!

450
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,180
She's not dead!

451
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:00,050
I am full of regret!

452
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,450
She is not dead.

453
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:03,850
- If it wasn't for you...
- She is fine.

454
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,890
How can my daughter be dead!?

455
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:06,790
She's not dead.

456
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,960
Look! She's dead!

457
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:09,890
She's not dead.

458
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,290
- She can't see anything anymore!
- She's not dead!

459
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,890
She's not dead, you understand!?

460
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,060
The one who should be dead is you!

461
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:20,570
Shengnan.

462
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,910
Mama is sorry.

463
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,210
She can't be dead.

464
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,340
She's not dead.

465
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:33,350
Save her!

466
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,850
You speak of compassion!
How could you just watch her die!?

467
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,090
Fine! Don't save her!

468
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,360
I will kill each and every last one of you.

469
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,590
I'll start with this damned old man.

470
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,800
- Sir!
- I'll kill you all!

471
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,600
I'll kill you all!

472
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,440
Sir!

473
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,670
Kill you all!

474
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:00,740
Sir!

475
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:02,380
Restrain him!

476
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,460
I'll kill you all!

477
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,870
I'm going to kill you all...

478
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,700
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

479
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,000
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

480
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,870
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

481
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:13,140
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

482
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:16,240
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

483
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:19,210
Leave Shaolin...

484
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,080
This one doesn't count.

485
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:27,390
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

486
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,660
Leave Shaolin...

487
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,720
Is anyone there!?

488
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,570
I set a trap for pigs, how come a man is here?

489
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,340
What are you up to, covered in blood?

490
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,580
I know you, you are that Hou Jie.

491
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:52,710
You still want to kill people?

492
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,950
When a man is without common sense
is when they are worse than pigs.

493
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,290
Given you're in this situation, best lie still.

494
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:00,620
Don't howl.

495
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,360
Relax a bit,  I'll be back later.

496
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:07,590
Amitabha.

497
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,310
Hey, something to eat.

498
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:57,410
Careful, it's hot.

499
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,510
Cool on the outside, hot on the inside.

500
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,200
Why has it come to this?

501
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:19,700
Why?

502
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,710
Your wife has left Shaolin.

503
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,950
Your daughter's funeral has been left to you.

504
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,980
Will it be a burial or cremation?

505
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,480
The Abbot asked me to ask you.

506
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:15,390
With burials, you can see them on holidays.

507
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,490
But who can really see them?

508
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,730
I guess you can dig them out but that's not easy either.

509
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,100
I think cremation is more convenient.

510
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,230
You can see them anytime and take them with you if you move.

511
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,870
To where ever you go.

512
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:33,410
I think cremation is better.
What do you think?

513
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:45,320
If its cremation...

514
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:47,890
Then after you've finished your noodles,
we'll go light the fire.

515
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,640
Take all this and burn it!

516
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:25,460
So you'd rather die than submit?

517
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,830
At least I'll see Brother in the afterlife.

518
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,930
Fire!

519
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:35,340
When you were being hunted...

520
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,670
It was Big Brother who saved you.

521
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,340
Who would have thought...

522
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,810
You'd repay his kindness with hatred!

523
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:46,180
What is kindness?

524
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,590
He didn't save me, he used me.

525
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,820
I've known that for a long time now,
he needed me.

526
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,590
In battle, it was I that killed the most people.

527
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,100
Was there a bit of land I didn't help him conquer?

528
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,700
Then why did I betray Hou Jie?

529
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:11,370
Answer correctly and I will spare you.

530
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:14,210
Because...

531
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,480
You are a dog!

532
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:24,720
Wrong answer.

533
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:36,900
I betrayed him, because he was afraid.

534
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:41,370
With fear, comes defeat.

535
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,000
He deserved this.

536
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,540
Now begins my reign.

537
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,740
You understand?

538
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:19,770
The streets are filled with them,
everywhere with wanted posters.

539
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,940
Actually, it's the same whoever captures you.

540
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,150
Anyway, I've to make rice for you again.

541
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,786
Otherwise, I'll have made fifty thousand silvers now.

542
00:55:31,048 --> 00:55:32,341
[ WANTED: Hou Jie ]
[ REWARD: Ten thousand silvers ]

543
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,920
Eh? It's now a hundred thousand.

544
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,930
Just kidding.

545
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,800
Shaolin temple preaches compassion,
I wouldn't do that to you.

546
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:45,470
So what now?

547
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,800
I don't want to leave.

548
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:53,710
You can't treat this place as your home.

549
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,400
What's this?

550
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:24,740
Throwing a tantrum?

551
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:26,610
Made up your mind?

552
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:26,713
Want some help?

553
00:57:30,565 --> 00:57:31,631
- Brother.
- Brother.

554
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:39,490
There is suddenly a lot more rice in the kitchens.

555
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:41,660
How did this happen?

556
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,500
A lot more rice?

557
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,370
Oh! Our prayers have been answered!

558
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:54,370
Amitabha, amitabha, amitabha.

559
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,180
Then you better ask Buddha...

560
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:02,050
Why there are shadow men jumping
about on the rooftops at night?

561
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,550
Shadow men?

562
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,290
How can there be shadow men
at the temple?

563
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:09,290
They came to steal the rice.

564
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,390
It's to steal the rice back here,
not steal the rice.

565
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,570
All involved present to the training grounds
after morning lessons for your punishment!

566
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,300
Yes, Elder Brother.

567
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,590
You again!

568
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:43,290
What the hell do you want?

569
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:45,860
Amitabha.

570
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,460
Master.

571
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,730
Abbot, I want to stay at Shaolin.

572
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,240
That's not for you to decide.

573
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:57,840
You are now wanted.

574
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,110
Isn't so you can avoid capture?

575
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,240
I've decided to become a monk.

576
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:08,110
Shaolin will not become your battlefield,
The decision is not yours to make.

577
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,120
Return to whence you came.

578
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:15,460
Did the Abbot not say once,
"Buddha sends the fated"?

579
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,460
Who says you are fated?

580
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:19,490
Master.

581
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,130
You'll only receive his body,
you won't receive his heart.

582
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,470
His sins are great.
He is a warlord, Master.

583
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,870
Master, a person like him will
sully the name of Shaolin Temple.

584
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,970
There is the essence of Buddha in all.

585
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,110
We should not discriminate.

586
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,120
Everything is empty,
only fate is with substance.

587
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:47,690
His heart is full of hatred and revenge,
it will not receive the enlightenment.

588
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,120
Well said.

589
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:54,790
But we cannot deny the teachings
of Buddha by closing the way.

590
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,130
Nor can we, if we tried.

591
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,500
Troublesome is the Bodhi,
since understanding is confusing.

592
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,310
The old ways are dying.

593
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:09,310
I think, we should let him stay for now.

594
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,450
The Abbot has dumped you on me again?

595
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:19,820
But being in Shaolin is alright.

596
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,320
Out there, it's a dog eat dog world.

597
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,160
Wait outside.

598
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,030
New Baldy, it's cold, wear this.

599
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,660
Off to work!

600
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:37,980
- Amitabha!
- Morning.

601
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:45,509
[ Asiatorrents Wan Sui! ]
[ Malvinh Wan Sui! ]

602
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,420
Mantous are here! Make way!

603
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:57,190
Make way! Mantous are here!

604
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,390
Line up! Line up!

605
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:10,800
Thank you.

606
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:13,710
Not so hard, eh?

607
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,400
Not hard.

608
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,710
Don't push, don't push.
Plenty, plenty.

609
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,560
Strike without the fist being seen.
Not the way if it is.

610
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:37,730
Practice to the Way.

611
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,670
Actions are fluid.

612
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:41,730
Move with feeling.

613
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,300
Know the fine.

614
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,070
Awaken to the Zen.

615
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:55,310
Quickly bring the wooden container
to hold the food!

616
01:02:55,578 --> 01:02:56,609
Okay.

617
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,270
Hey.

618
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:21,330
Have you practised before?

619
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,200
What?

620
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,600
- Kungfu
- Kungfu?

621
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,680
Truth is, when I was younger I trained for two years.

622
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:31,850
But like you, my heart was not focused.

623
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,180
So I worked in the kitchen.

624
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,850
You want to learn,
learn the Dharma.

625
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:41,550
Dharma.

626
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,720
Faced the wall for nine years.

627
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:47,430
What was he refining?
The heart.

628
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,230
Without conflict, gained wisdom
from every inch of his body.

629
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:53,970
The thoughts from his hair
is as the hair on our head.

630
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,200
This level is called the Zen Wu.

631
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,330
Let's practise together.

632
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,230
Fists and heart as one.

633
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,070
Elbows and knees as one.

634
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,170
Shoulders and hips as one.

635
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,410
Heart and mind as one.

636
01:05:43,378 --> 01:05:44,776
Mind and breath as one.

637
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:47,180
Breath and strength as one.

638
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,320
Practise to the Way.

639
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:51,480
Actions are fluid.

640
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:53,550
Move with feeling.

641
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,190
Know the fine.

642
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,860
Awaken to the Zen.

643
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:03,830
Stay strong!

644
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,440
They're hopping down, we're squatting down.
Both ways build strength.

645
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,370
Straighten up!

646
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,390
Hold down this meridian.

647
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:28,720
It'll be alright.

648
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,770
You go now, go.

649
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:46,430
For you.

650
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:55,840
The weather is cold,
why are you not inside resting?

651
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:58,110
Precisely because it is cold,
I am here practising.

652
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,050
Are you cold?

653
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,500
A little.

654
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,350
Then practice with me.

655
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:07,820
Okay.

656
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:06,750
Abbot, his form is a bit off.

657
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,290
From the heart it follows,
from thoughts give rise.

658
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:15,760
He is fine as he is.

659
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:23,300
In practising martial arts,
the vengeance in his heart is released.

660
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,770
I do not practise martial arts,
this I do not understand.

661
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:31,300
Practising martial arts is Zen,
cooking is also Zen.

662
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:33,770
The principles are roughly the same.

663
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:40,310
Wudao, the most important things in
life are experience and practise.

664
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:42,720
I've said it many times.

665
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,790
Leave Shaolin Temple,
go see the world outside.

666
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,660
All I know is how to cook.

667
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,720
Out there, I'm of no use.

668
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,120
I'm not going.

669
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:55,800
A piece of gold and a pile of dirt.

670
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,360
Which has more use?

671
01:09:57,970 --> 01:09:59,230
I guess the piece of gold.

672
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:00,470
And if I gave you a seed?

673
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,800
Don't sell yourself short.

674
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,110
Everyone is useful in their own way.

675
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:47,380
Cao Man, you want us to help the foreigners build the railway.

676
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,650
But you mustn't forget,
Mangshan is the resting place of our ancestors.

677
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:55,560
Disturb the soil and you break the Feng Shui.

678
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:58,020
The ancestors will never agree to this!

679
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,360
If you are really going to do it, I have nothing to say.

680
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,030
I'm just worried that the foreigners are playing us...

681
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,300
And making deals under the table.

682
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:17,580
Cao Man, your betrayal of Hou...

683
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,380
We don't care.

684
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:22,880
He previously said,
building the railway is just a cover.

685
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:25,190
It's true intent is to take our land.

686
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:27,550
Okay, okay, okay.
Say no more.

687
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,690
Henan Province's interests are not for one man to decide.

688
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:35,060
But looking at Cao Man's attitude, it seems
he's already made an agreement with the foreigners.

689
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:37,460
There was no intention to hear us out.

690
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,070
Go.

691
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:13,730
Listen well.
Standing in my way...

692
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,200
Is not in your best interests.

693
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:19,910
They are fortunate.

694
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:21,440
But their families...

695
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,140
Will die much more horrible deaths.

696
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:26,980
Whether to become my friend or my enemy...

697
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,920
Is for you to decide.

698
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,420
Have a think.

699
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:40,930
If there is money to be made, noone loses out.

700
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:56,440
What do we do now?
He hasn't returned yet.

701
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,310
Don't cry, Aunt.
Okay?

702
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:07,590
Crying won't bring him back any sooner.

703
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:08,590
What has happened?

704
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:13,960
Master, our Daniel has been gone
for over twenty days now.

705
01:13:14,531 --> 01:13:15,679
What should we do?

706
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,680
[ NOTICE: Seeking all able men aged 16 to 40 for work on the Zhengsong railway. ]

707
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,570
Cao Man is building a railway?

708
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:21,470
Our family depends on him.

709
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:32,850
Work quickly, on pain of death.

710
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:34,780
You hear?

711
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,120
Faster! Faster!

712
01:14:08,182 --> 01:14:09,210
Who's there!?

713
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:12,250
What the hell are you up to?

714
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,660
Commander Hou.

715
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:19,530
Why did you kill so many people?

716
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:22,560
It was...
It was Commander Cao's orders.

717
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,360
Leave.

718
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,300
Leave!

719
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,770
Hou Jie still lives!
Hou Jie still lives!

720
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,080
Let's go.

721
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:51,560
Cao Man lied to us about building the railway.

722
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,060
Who knew he was really digging for
artifacts for the foreigners.

723
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,700
Each one we found, we gave to them.

724
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,600
In exchange for guns and cannons.

725
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,440
He was worried it might leak it out,
so he had them silenced.

726
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:21,590
The Cao Villa still holds many of our brothers.

727
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:24,120
At the end of tomorrow's work,
they will all be killed.

728
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,830
I am sorry.

729
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,370
Go home.

730
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,340
Quick! We're going.

731
01:16:23,638 --> 01:16:26,647
Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!

732
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,320
Go have a look.

733
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,730
How could this be!?

734
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:21,210
In life till now, committed terrible crimes...

735
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:26,350
All stemming from the greed of man.

736
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:30,250
The actions of one...

737
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:35,290
Today begs for the Buddha's forgiveness.

738
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,290
Evil came to trouble the mind...

739
01:17:39,595 --> 01:17:41,008
Enough!

740
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,300
Hereon will trouble no more.

741
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,100
Shengnan!

742
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:52,870
Corruption is without value...

743
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,610
How can my daughter be dead!?

744
01:17:57,010 --> 01:18:00,150
Purity without excess.

745
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:12,030
Forget bygones with one cut,
one cut to sever all.

746
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,560
Then will you understand all
that is before you.

747
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,070
From today on,
this rite bestows the Three Jewels.

748
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,440
The Buddha is realised.

749
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,940
The Way is straightened.

750
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,810
The monk is at peace.

751
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:36,320
Hereon, you will be known
by this order as Jingjue.

752
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,050
Amitabha.

753
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,560
Amitabha.

754
01:18:56,958 --> 01:18:58,408
Capture Hou Jie alive!

755
01:18:58,780 --> 01:18:59,814
Capture Hou Jie alive!

756
01:19:00,409 --> 01:19:01,995
Capture Hou Jie alive!

757
01:19:17,696 --> 01:19:19,008
Sir!

758
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,020
It's Cao Man! I'm going to stop him!

759
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:40,890
Get back here!

760
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:42,250
Sit down!

761
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:44,060
Calm down.

762
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:48,560
He's come at a good time.

763
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,560
Seize the moment, I will take him back.

764
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:56,030
After sunset, go to Cao Villa.

765
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:57,800
Rescue the people.

766
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:58,740
You'll go?

767
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:00,840
You are walking to your own death.

768
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:03,510
If my life can be exchanged for countless others...

769
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,650
What is death?

770
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:10,750
Jingjue, you must be careful.

771
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,040
Nobody move!

772
01:20:57,204 --> 01:20:59,408
- Nobody move!
- Nobody move!

773
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:08,910
Amitabha.

774
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:29,090
Please Sir, release the meat cleaver.

775
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:33,430
Continue committing sins
and suffer disastrous consequences.

776
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:46,850
That was for my daughter.

777
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:49,520
Amitabha.

778
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:51,620
That sure is my Big Brother.

779
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:55,750
I knew you wouldn't die that easily.

780
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:00,860
Brother, I thought of you terribly.

781
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:02,260
Thought of me?

782
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:07,970
If I don't die, you can't sleep, right?

783
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:09,900
Don't be ridiculous.

784
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,270
Nothing of the sort.

785
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:17,470
Don't pretend.

786
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:21,480
You're afraid I will take you down.

787
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:36,200
Jingjue's actions are to
give us an opportunity...

788
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:37,760
So we can save lives.

789
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,330
Your impulsiveness will ruin the plan.

790
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,830
You understand!?

791
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:53,580
You once taught me...

792
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:58,850
Gain the upper hand and you hesitate a moment too long,
the one dead will be you.

793
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:01,350
I remembered.

794
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,730
Pull back your men, I'll go with you.

795
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,280
String the Abbot up.

796
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:35,020
Do anything rash and I'll send him to the gods.

797
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:38,060
No objections, everyone stand down.

798
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:49,170
Come then.

799
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:12,560
You promised to have these at Zhengzhou before dawn.

800
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:13,660
Relax.

801
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:16,300
With Cao's troops, noone will dare block our way.

802
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:19,300
Remain vigilant.

803
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:24,070
Make way! Make way!

804
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,960
Get down! I'm talking to you!

805
01:24:46,796 --> 01:24:47,766
Get down!

806
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,830
Quickly!

807
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:52,830
Get in quickly!

808
01:24:56,970 --> 01:25:00,110
Big brother, isn't this place more beautiful than before?

809
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:03,610
You bring me here...

810
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,610
Wasn't just for me to praise you, was it?

811
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:11,120
Of course not.

812
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:14,220
I was wrong. Please forgive me.

813
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,990
I hope that Brother will once again take me in.

814
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:23,660
Conquering the world and
achieving great things.

815
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,730
Brother, look...

816
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:28,900
This was all for your sake.

817
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:30,740
This throne is yours.

818
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,670
This imperial robe is also yours.

819
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:41,750
Brother.

820
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,750
Is money and power really that important to you?

821
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:53,430
Listen to me.

822
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,430
Don't become like me.

823
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:02,330
Faking compassion?

824
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:06,670
I was messing with you...

825
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,340
To see how you would play along!

826
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:13,210
I have a gift for you.

827
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:14,950
Bring her out here!

828
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:53,450
I found him for you, Sister.

829
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:57,090
I spared her, so man and wife can be reunited.

830
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:15,794
Get down!

831
01:27:23,313 --> 01:27:24,458
About face!

832
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,200
You've suffered.

833
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:02,290
I used to think I was powerful.

834
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,300
I could take care of both of you.

835
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,800
But instead, I destroyed us.

836
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:32,220
Ready guns!

837
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,290
Don't shoot!

838
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:40,900
Raise arms!

839
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:47,440
Fire!

840
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:50,710
Fire!

841
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:53,440
Guards stay! The rest follow me!

842
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,300
Yes!

843
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:11,900
Master, save us! Save us!

844
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,540
You men! Go see what's happening!

845
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,400
Yes!

846
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,790
The artifacts are being stolen!
After them!

847
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,100
Out of my way!

848
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,050
Hou Jie!

849
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:38,550
Let go of her!

850
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:41,720
Let go of her!

851
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:42,590
Big brother...

852
01:30:43,450 --> 01:30:44,590
You're crying!

853
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:47,060
Let her go!

854
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,960
Your death alone...

855
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:51,930
Won't satisfy me.

856
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,370
You watched your daughter die...

857
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,370
Now I want you to watch your wife die.

858
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:00,740
Then I can be happy.

859
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,780
You animal! Let her go!

860
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:10,880
Let her go!

861
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:21,260
Sister is very pretty.
What a shame...

862
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:23,630
You are a monk.

863
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:36,970
Cao Man! Stop it!

864
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:46,680
Commander!
Shaolin monks have stolen the artifacts!

865
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,790
Attacked the prison and released the prisoners!

866
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,800
You deceived me.

867
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:06,341
Kill him.

868
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,470
Jingjue! Go!

869
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:43,970
Go quickly.

870
01:33:20,511 --> 01:33:21,254
Go!

871
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:30,620
Eldest brother!

872
01:33:52,221 --> 01:33:53,350
Go!

873
01:33:58,650 --> 01:33:59,620
Go!

874
01:34:00,025 --> 01:34:00,914
Go!

875
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:10,630
Eldest brother!

876
01:34:10,636 --> 01:34:11,376
Go!

877
01:34:13,130 --> 01:34:14,130
Go!

878
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:16,370
Eldest brother!

879
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:29,880
Eldest brother! Eldest brother! Eldest brother!

880
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:31,880
You won't listen to my orders!?

881
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:35,120
Go!

882
01:34:38,164 --> 01:34:39,567
Go!

883
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,490
Go! We'll escort the villagers first!

884
01:36:28,572 --> 01:36:29,609
What do you want?

885
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:30,680
Back inside!

886
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:35,720
Abbot.

887
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:37,790
Get back inside.

888
01:36:45,136 --> 01:36:45,801
Hey!

889
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:47,570
Little monk, don't force me.

890
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:49,230
I warn you to go back inside now.

891
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:51,100
I don't want to kill children.

892
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:12,460
Sir, please show compassion.

893
01:37:12,730 --> 01:37:14,090
Let us save the Abbot.

894
01:37:14,490 --> 01:37:16,830
You will attain wealth and happiness.

895
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:25,470
Sir, Abbot always said...

896
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:27,640
A brave man is one who knows to return
after having lost his way.

897
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:30,110
Put it down and go home.

898
01:37:30,610 --> 01:37:32,840
I'm sure your family is waiting for you.

899
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:49,860
Insolence!

900
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,800
Want to rebel? Catch them!

901
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:11,050
Amitabha.

902
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,830
I don't want to fight!
I don't know kungfu!

903
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,090
Amitabha.

904
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,310
Stop fighting!

905
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:43,180
Don't want to fight anymore!

906
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:58,730
I'll fight you with my life!

907
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:16,850
Abbot!

908
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:18,250
Are you hurt?

909
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,590
Uncle! Toss them like you were frying vegetables!

910
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:49,810
Uncle! Beat them like you were kneading dough!

911
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,310
Uncle! Great!

912
01:40:18,215 --> 01:40:19,800
- Abbot!
- Abbot!

913
01:40:20,210 --> 01:40:21,310
Are you alright?

914
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,450
We must get inside quickly.

915
01:40:24,664 --> 01:40:25,885
- Okay.
- Go.

916
01:40:47,470 --> 01:40:48,470
It's them!

917
01:40:54,729 --> 01:40:55,799
Huzi!

918
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:01,850
Mother!

919
01:41:08,389 --> 01:41:09,483
Father!

920
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:30,750
Jingneng's sacrifice was not in vain.

921
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:35,090
Don't be too attached.

922
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:56,780
Sirs and Madams, please ready and pack your things.

923
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:00,910
We are leaving Shaolin Temple.

924
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:19,300
I know you are scared.

925
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:22,770
But I am not.

926
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:27,070
Because my loved ones are gone,
my family is already lost.

927
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:30,580
Who wouldn't be scared?

928
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:37,820
These few days...

929
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:43,320
I felt just like you...

930
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:46,590
Shaolin Temple is a happy place.

931
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:49,460
It has become our home.

932
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:53,100
Shaolin Temple might...

933
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,170
Meet its end today.

934
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,110
But the spirit of Shaolin...

935
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:03,080
Every flower and blade of grass...

936
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:05,890
Its beams and columns,
its bricks and tiles...

937
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:09,680
Will forever stay in our hearts.

938
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,680
The spirit of Shaolin...

939
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:17,990
Taught me to persevere and show courage.

940
01:43:19,534 --> 01:43:20,939
To never abandon hope.

941
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:27,478
I ask you all to live your lives as best you can.

942
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:14,900
I have a favour to ask of you.

943
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:16,040
What?

944
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:20,740
You lead them out of here.

945
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:22,040
No, no, no.

946
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:24,410
I have never left Shaolin Temple.

947
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:26,720
No, no, no.
I'm scared.

948
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:29,180
You're scared?

949
01:44:30,090 --> 01:44:31,190
Look at them.

950
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:33,090
They need you.

951
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:36,490
They are more scared than you.

952
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,000
I...
Let me think...

953
01:44:49,368 --> 01:44:50,243
Fine.

954
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:52,880
I'll go.

955
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:29,950
We must distract them.

956
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:32,550
We must escort the villagers up the mountain.

957
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:35,150
Jinghai, take the Abbot first.

958
01:45:35,690 --> 01:45:37,420
Jingkong, you lead.
I'll catch up.

959
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:39,150
- Move quickly!
- I'll fight them with my life!

960
01:45:40,542 --> 01:45:41,309
Quickly!

961
01:45:42,430 --> 01:45:43,430
Move quickly!

962
01:47:02,510 --> 01:47:03,510
Go quickly!

963
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:31,200
You bastards! Want to destroy Shaolin!?

964
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:32,430
I'll destroy you!

965
01:48:39,950 --> 01:48:42,790
Cao Man, wake up already.

966
01:48:44,990 --> 01:48:49,290
You must know, you've always had more than you need.

967
01:48:50,860 --> 01:48:54,430
Put it down, discontinue this path.

968
01:48:57,970 --> 01:49:01,210
We are in a war, it has always been like this.

969
01:49:02,210 --> 01:49:03,210
Don't be like me.

970
01:49:05,650 --> 01:49:07,710
I've come to realise my past crimes.

971
01:49:12,490 --> 01:49:13,320
It's time to stop.

972
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:15,220
Could we not fight?

973
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:17,320
What do you think?

974
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:30,900
I yield.

975
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:59,380
Shaolin Temple?

976
01:52:26,450 --> 01:52:28,950
Shaolin Temple will not be dishonoured.

977
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:46,200
Buddha is compassionate.

978
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:10,120
Madam! You can't leave! It's dangerous outside!

979
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:11,990
Abbot! My child is missing!

980
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:13,830
My child is missing!

981
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:15,990
Mama!

982
01:53:31,460 --> 01:53:32,004
Brother.

983
01:53:32,005 --> 01:53:32,813
- Brother!
- Brother!

984
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:36,080
Quick! Quick!

985
01:53:36,244 --> 01:53:37,014
Brother...

986
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:39,750
Brother!

987
01:53:48,471 --> 01:53:50,117
- Brother!
- Jinghai...

988
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:51,760
Brother!

989
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:01,870
Amitabha.

990
01:54:04,021 --> 01:54:05,330
- Brother!
- Brother!

991
01:54:05,650 --> 01:54:06,550
Brother!

992
01:54:07,125 --> 01:54:08,728
- Brother!
- Brother!

993
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:12,180
I will stay behind!
You all must deliver the villagers safely!

994
01:54:12,450 --> 01:54:12,980
Abbot!

995
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:41,630
It's time you woke up...

996
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:13,700
Hold onto me!

997
01:56:49,230 --> 01:56:51,700
Amitabha.

998
01:56:58,210 --> 01:56:59,310
Evil is borne from the heart.

999
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:02,980
Repent.

1000
01:58:10,780 --> 01:58:11,880
Why?

1001
02:02:41,764 --> 02:02:42,883
Uncle...

1002
02:02:44,171 --> 02:02:45,176
The temple is gone.

1003
02:02:48,374 --> 02:02:51,577
It's okay.
Shaolin Temple is in our hearts.

1004
02:02:52,096 --> 02:02:53,228
It will never be burnt down.

1005
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:23,497
Life follows fate.

1006
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:29,768
Fate follows life.
From which we can live at ease.

1007
02:03:32,031 --> 02:03:32,954
Here.

1008
02:03:34,206 --> 02:03:35,788
Hereon, she will keep you company.

1009
02:03:52,072 --> 02:03:53,157
You won't go?

1010
02:03:57,638 --> 02:03:58,908
Cao Man is here.

1011
02:04:01,692 --> 02:04:03,016
His mistakes are also mine.

1012
02:04:04,748 --> 02:04:06,103
Only I can help him.

1013
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:12,633
You've really changed.

1014
02:04:17,484 --> 02:04:18,521
I know...

1015
02:04:22,925 --> 02:04:24,970
We can't be together again.

1016
02:04:28,753 --> 02:04:29,700
But...

1017
02:04:33,573 --> 02:04:36,386
I am really happy for you.
