1
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:40,015
He's clean.

2
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:43,014
So...

3
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:45,618
Why are you here? Hm?

4
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:34,355
<i>There was a time.</i>

5
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:49,320
4:35.

6
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:52,403
You misunderstood.

7
00:04:52,487 --> 00:04:56,321
I wasn't asking for the time,
I was just saying, "There was a time."

8
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:00,160
There was a time?

9
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,807
Mm-hm.

10
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:04,164
Take brown sugar back there, for example.

11
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,279
<i>She's pretty fucking foxy, right?</i>

12
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,130
She's 70.

13
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,167
If she's a day.

14
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:13,730
But there was a time.

15
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:18,168
- I don't follow.
- The name's Smith. I'm from out of town.

16
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,208
- Listen, Mr. Smith...
- Just Smith.

17
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:24,611
The reason I'm in town,
in case you're wondering...

18
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:28,448
...is because of a Kansas City Shuffle.

19
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:31,046
What's a Kansas City Shuffle?

20
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:36,526
Kansas City Shuffle is
when everybody looks right and you go left.

21
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:38,571
- Never heard of it.
- Hm.

22
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:40,726
It's not something people hear about.

23
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:43,488
Falls on deaf ears mostly.

24
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:47,448
But this particular one's
been over 20 years in the making.

25
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:48,970
<i>20 years, huh?</i>

26
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,013
No small matter.

27
00:05:53,778 --> 00:05:55,735
Requires a lot of planning.

28
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:58,815
It involves a lot of people.

29
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,492
People connected only
by the slightest of events.

30
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,496
Like whispers in the night...

31
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,214
...in that place that never forgets
even when those people do.

32
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,697
It all starts with a horse.

33
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:25,821
<i>It's what they called back then</i>
<i>a drugstore handicap.</i>

34
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:30,824
<i>A guy wants what the fella calls a sure thing,</i>
<i>so he schemes to make it so.</i>

35
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:36,694
<i>He calls in the doc, a nobbler from Antwerp</i>
<i>known for his savvy but not for his discretion.</i>

36
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:41,177
WOMA N: O<i>h, fuck me, baby, fuck me, baby.</i>

37
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:44,339
<i>The same could be said</i>
<i>for Doc's jelly on the side - Gloria.</i>

38
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:46,896
- Almost there, almost there.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

39
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:49,343
Hey, which horse did you say
it was again, baby?

40
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,269
<i>Which brings us to Abe, because Gloria</i>
<i>was too much jelly for one outfit.</i>

41
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:05,267
Hey, baby, is your wife around?

42
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:07,502
- <i>What do you want?</i>
WOMA N: <i>Who is it, Abe?</i>

43
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:10,188
<i>Ah... it's Seymour.</i>

44
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:14,345
GLORIA: <i>Sure, tell that bitch to open her eyes,</i>
<i>maybe then she'd see more.</i>

45
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,389
Seymour says hello.

46
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:18,941
What are you doing calling me here?

47
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:22,470
Christmas came early this year, baby.
I got a present for you.

48
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:24,147
Remember my friend Doc?

49
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:27,705
SMITH: <i>Now Abe wasn't a nosy fella,</i>
<i>but he had a nose.</i>

50
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:30,711
<i>And right below his nose was his mouth.</i>

51
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:33,706
ABE: <i>Do you remember Gloria the hooker?</i>

52
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:38,473
Well, Gloria's got this friend Doc
who's got a line on a doped-up racehorse.

53
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:40,514
<i>The fix is in at Aqueduct.</i>

54
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:42,828
- Seventh horse. Tenth race.
- Doped up?

55
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:45,591
SMITH:
<i>And then there was this joker who had ears...</i>

56
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,957
ABE: <i>Let's get back.</i>

57
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:50,269
SMITH: <i>... who looked like somebody's uncle.</i>

58
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:52,316
Max, who's your favorite uncle?

59
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,550
OK, who's your second favorite uncle?

60
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,393
Just pay attention.

61
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,233
I got something here.

62
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,950
SMITH: <i>And before you know it,</i>
<i>folks are getting a big dose of the gimmies,</i>

63
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,475
<i>and men start talking their hats off.</i>

64
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:09,113
<i>And that Manischewitz Grapevine Wine spills in</i>
<i>your ear and tells you, you got a sure thing,</i>

65
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:11,636
<i>and what's worse is, you start to believe it.</i>

66
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:14,514
<i>At least that's how it went with old Max,</i>

67
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:16,674
<i>who wasn't so much old, as he was tired.</i>

68
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:19,480
<i>Tired of being a dog without a day.</i>

69
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:22,841
<i>Tired of waking up and finding</i>
<i>that his dreams were only dreams.</i>

70
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:24,153
We're leaving.

71
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:27,761
<i>But mostly,</i>
<i>Max was tired of not having a front lawn.</i>

72
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,723
Make sure he doesn't come home late.

73
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:32,195
- I will.
- I was talking to your son.

74
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:34,562
- (Giggles)
- You think that's funny, do you?

75
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,286
Uh-huh. Bye, Mom.

76
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:38,517
Yeah. Bye, Mom!

77
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:39,802
Love you.

78
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:46,159
TANNOY: <i>They're off.</i>

79
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,169
All right, if your ma asks,
where were we today?

80
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,603
- Shea Stadium.
- To see?

81
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,569
- Mets v Phillies.
- Good man. Give me the post-game.

82
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:59,290
Stallard gave up six runs in the first five innings.

83
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,524
Ed Kranepool hit a line drive down right field
but it hit the wall, fouled by a foot.

84
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:05,887
Gonder hit a groundball
between first and second

85
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:09,124
but he's so slow, second baseman
Tony Taylor tagged him out at first.

86
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:12,370
Did you get all that from the radio?

87
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:13,603
Mm -hm.

88
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:15,286
You're good.

89
00:09:15,374 --> 00:09:17,206
OK, I'll be right back.

90
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:19,570
No, no, no. You've got to stay in the car.

91
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:21,214
Why?

92
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,174
Because they don't let little boys inside the track.

93
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,852
Saul's dad takes him to the track.

94
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:29,167
Well, Saul's dad is a degenerate gambler.

95
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:32,533
And if you're the son of a degenerate gambler,
they let you in.

96
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:34,574
It's economically viable.

97
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,888
Are you going to be a degenerate gambler?

98
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:40,095
Hey. You know better than that.

99
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,013
Your old man's smart.
He only plays a sure thing.

100
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,612
Look.
This money's gonna get you through Harvard.

101
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:50,453
And you're gonna be a doctor.

102
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,815
But until then...

103
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:53,813
you've got to stay in the car.

104
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:58,099
Hey.

105
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:01,016
Next weekend, you and me go to a ballgame.

106
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:02,855
- OK.
- OK.

107
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:04,661
I love you, kid.

108
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:06,336
I love you too, Dad.

109
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,980
Wait, watch. Watch, watch, watch.

110
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:11,021
I almost forgot. 15 minutes.

111
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:13,061
Start counting.

112
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:20,138
TANNOY:
<i>The next race at the Aqueduct is the tenth race.</i>

113
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:31,860
- Come on, come on.
TANNOY: <i>The field is making towards</i>

114
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:36,340
<i>the final turn, and Number Seven has moved</i>
<i>into fifth position on the outside.</i>

115
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:38,785
<i>- Number Two has the lead...</i>
- (Cheering)

116
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:40,428
Come on.

117
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,307
<i>Number One is against the rail.</i>

118
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,145
<i>And Number Seven is beginning</i>
<i>to pick up the pace on the outside.</i>

119
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,300
Yes!

120
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:50,189
<i>Yes, come on, baby, come on!</i>

121
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:54,221
- Let's go!
- (Cheering intensifies)

122
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:58,864
<i>... to challenge, goes clear</i>
<i>and Number Seven takes the lead!</i>

123
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:00,865
<i>It's Number Seven who now has the lead.</i>

124
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:03,070
<i>It's strolling clear.</i>

125
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:04,064
Yes!

126
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:07,192
Oh!

127
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:11,511
<i>Number Seven has fallen!</i>

128
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:16,346
<i>Number One comes home</i>
<i>and takes the lead to win it.</i>

129
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:19,713
SMITH: <i>Max woke up to find his dreams</i>
<i>had just been the stuff of pipes.</i>

130
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:21,754
- I want to place a bet.
- How much?

131
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:23,066
20 large.

132
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,434
Oh, you must feel real lucky.

133
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,992
<i>I'll take your bet.</i>

134
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:30,831
And lay it off.

135
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,557
I've got a bookie's bookie.

136
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,352
I'll give you 2-1 on the horse.

137
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,000
Uh-uh. The racing form says 9-1.

138
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,954
So you go to a ticket vendor
with your 20 grand in hand,

139
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,840
and you get 9-1 if the spread sticks.

140
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:48,597
You come in here with your pockets turned out,
you get 2-1.

141
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:50,833
The juice is ten.

142
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:55,155
That means if you lose, you're all in for 22 grand.

143
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:57,200
20 for the bet, two for the juice.

144
00:11:58,003 --> 00:12:01,793
Can you pay these monies? Huh? Can you?

145
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:04,403
Yeah.

146
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:11,482
<i>Just to be clear,</i>

147
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,125
<i>if you lose...</i>

148
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:17,000
...you're gonna owe a lot of money
to the kind of men

149
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:22,003
you do not want to owe
the smallest amount of money to.

150
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:36,568
Henry!

151
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:38,760
Henry!

152
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:44,005
Henry!

153
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:47,971
Henry!

154
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:51,570
Hey, buddy. You got a light?

155
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:53,610
No. Henry!

156
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:56,926
In that case, how about the 20 Gs
you just blew on the Seven horse?

157
00:12:57,014 --> 00:13:00,132
- What have you done with my son?
- He's on his way home. Just like you.

158
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:01,171
Urgh!

159
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:11,329
Where am I?

160
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:20,528
Roth, he'll tell you everything, I swear.

161
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:26,056
He already has.

162
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:33,174
Please.

163
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:36,218
I have a family.

164
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:40,093
<i>Please.</i>

165
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:41,821
<i>Please!</i>

166
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:43,575
<i>Where's my boy?</i>

167
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,136
<i>Henry!</i>

168
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:53,097
<i>Where are they?</i>

169
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:58,182
<i>Henry!</i>

170
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:01,695
<i>Henry!</i>

171
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:17,978
Fuck.

172
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:19,423
Shit.

173
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,943
Jesus.

174
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,941
"Fuck, shit, Jesus" is right.

175
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,980
I don't understand.
Why did they kill Max's family?

176
00:14:26,071 --> 00:14:27,823
New outfit in town.

177
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:32,021
They didn't want somebody else
betting on a fixed horserace with them.

178
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:35,389
Trying to make an impression.

179
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,949
That's a fucking story, man.

180
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:43,391
Charlie Chaplin entered a Charlie Chaplin
look-a-like contest in Monte Carlo

181
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:45,430
and came in third.

182
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:47,471
Now that's a story.

183
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:51,551
This...

184
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:53,591
This is something else.

185
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:55,632
So that's a Kansas City Shuffle?

186
00:14:55,716 --> 00:14:57,035
No.

187
00:14:57,117 --> 00:14:59,072
It's just the inciting incident.

188
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:02,073
The catalyst.

189
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:06,269
This - is a Kansas City Shuffle.

190
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:09,595
<i>They look right...</i>

191
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:11,749
And you...

192
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,795
go left.

193
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,637
Sorry about that, son.

194
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:26,355
Sometimes there's more to life than just living.

195
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:30,758
Besides... you can't have a Kansas City Shuffle
without a body.

196
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:29,329
<i>- He's down!</i>
<i>- Get the roof!</i>

197
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:31,165
<i>Up there!</i>

198
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:25,779
I'm coming!

199
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:29,462
Coming.

200
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:35,181
It took you long enough.

201
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:37,698
You're not Nick.

202
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:40,095
You're not as tall as I thought you'd be.

203
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:42,143
Well, I'm short for my height.

204
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:47,422
That makes sense because I can usually
tell how tall someone is by their knock.

205
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:50,545
You have a deceptively tall knock.
Congratulations.

206
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:52,900
So it's a good thing?

207
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:57,020
I open the door expecting you to be up here,
you're down here.

208
00:17:57,108 --> 00:18:00,385
That combined with a low centre of gravity -
forget about it.

209
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,141
Who are you?

210
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,663
I'm Slevin.

211
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,742
And what happened to your nose?

212
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:08,741
I was using it to break some guy's fist.

213
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:10,787
Somebody hit you?

214
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:12,942
Yeah... I was kind of expecting it, though.

215
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:14,624
You were kind of expecting it?

216
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:17,068
Well, they say bad things happen in threes.

217
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,585
<i>First... I lost my job.</i>

218
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:24,871
<i>Then I came home to find</i>
<i>my apartment building had been condemned</i>

219
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:28,470
<i>due to a hybrid breed</i>
<i>of Ecuadorian Super Termites.</i>

220
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,511
<i>So I went to my girlfriend Kelly's.</i>

221
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:33,591
<i>I had a key so I let myself in.</i>

222
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:46,792
- Hey, don't stop on my account.
- Oh shit!

223
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:50,471
Slevin.

224
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,389
It was an accident.

225
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,911
What, like he tripped and you fell?

226
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,516
MA N: <i>Slevin, do you know what time it is?</i>

227
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:03,434
I'm at the airport,
are you sure you want me to come out?

228
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:06,753
<i>Yeah, two weeks in New York</i>
<i>and the only Kelly you'll remember</i>

229
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:10,471
<i>is the Kelly who gave you your first hand job</i>
<i>on the bus to summer camp.</i>

230
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:13,316
Kelly Perkins. Said her hands were dry
and she needed...

231
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,952
<i>She said that to a lot of guys,</i>
<i>that's why we called her Jerkins Perkins.</i>

232
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:19,604
<i>- Just call me when you land, all right?</i>
- Yeah.

233
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:31,637
Yeah, I just got into town, Nick.
I'm on my way over to your place.

234
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:33,683
Say, man, you got the time?

235
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:36,918
Ya, man, it's uh... 7:23.

236
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:38,963
So you're probably still asleep?

237
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:41,516
- Yo, you got a smoke?
- No, I don't smoke, man.

238
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:45,887
<i>Why don't you just go ahead and give me</i>
<i>your wallet and I'll buy my own smokes?</i>

239
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:47,448
Am I being mugged?

240
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:50,324
Man!

241
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:52,286
And so here I am.

242
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,566
You said three.

243
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,880
- What?
- You said bad things happen in threes.

244
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,680
You lost your job, your apartment was
condemned, Kelly was cheating on you

245
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:03,523
<i>and you got mugged - that makes four.</i>

246
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:05,489
When you're on a roll, you're on a roll.

247
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,324
Interesting, although I would add,

248
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:10,132
not the ever so clever hold-up man
one hears so much about.

249
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:13,410
- Well, he did break my nose.
- But overlooked your suitcase.

250
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:15,529
Maybe it wouldn't make for a speedy getaway.

251
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,606
True, but then there's the matter of your watch.
Pretty fancy.

252
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:20,526
- It's a fake.
- But he didn't know that.

253
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:23,334
- Maybe he didn't see it.
- He saw it. He asked you for the time.

254
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,372
You say this was your third mugging?

255
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:27,014
Uh... I travel a lot.

256
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,849
Where's Nick?

257
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,009
I don't know. He was supposed to
meet me here. He never showed up.

258
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,974
- How did you get in?
<i>- Door was open.</i>

259
00:20:34,057 --> 00:20:36,128
- Door was open?
- Yeah.

260
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:38,368
- Open or unlocked?
- I don't remember.

261
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,417
- You said open.
- Could have been. What was your name again?

262
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:43,455
Lindsey. I live across the hall.

263
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,769
- Oh.
- I came over to borrow a cup of sugar.

264
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:48,168
- Where's your cup?
- I came to borrow a <i>cup</i> of sugar.

265
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,330
If I had a cup, I'd have come to borrow sugar.

266
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,058
- Touché.
- (Phone rings)

267
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:54,575
Maybe that's Nick. It's right there.

268
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:56,337
Hello?

269
00:20:57,782 --> 00:20:59,135
Hello?

270
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:03,099
They hung up.

271
00:21:03,182 --> 00:21:06,414
I have an idea. Have you used the phone
since you've been here?

272
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:08,460
No, except for that.

273
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:10,862
Sorry, wrong number.

274
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:12,662
That was the Hotel Cheval.

275
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:14,541
What are you doing?

276
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,456
We know who he called. Who called him?

277
00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:18,775
- Columbo says three things...
- Columbo?

278
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:22,017
Yeah, Columbo was this TV detective
played by Peter Falk...

279
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:24,337
I know who Columbo is. Yeah.

280
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:26,337
He looked for three things at a crime scene.

281
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:29,737
What's there now that wasn't before.
What was there before that isn't now.

282
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:32,058
- And what's been moved.
- Is this a crime scene?

283
00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:34,025
- I think Nick's in trouble.
- Ah.

284
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:35,462
Sorry, wrong number.

285
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:37,504
That was the Hotel Cheval again!

286
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:41,298
So what? He called the hotel,
the hotel called him back. Makes sense.

287
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:42,743
So, maybe it's a clue.

288
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,060
- A clue to what?
- A clue to what happened to Nick.

289
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,348
- We don't know anything did.
- We don't know anything <i>didn't.</i>

290
00:21:49,431 --> 00:21:52,788
You're here, he's not. The door was open.
Bad things happen where you...

291
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,782
Shit. I've got to stop by work.

292
00:21:54,872 --> 00:21:58,581
Just for a couple of hours. I'll come back,
then we can start the investigation.

293
00:21:59,593 --> 00:22:01,982
- The investigation?
- Uh-huh. It'll be fun.

294
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:02,869
OK.

295
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:07,910
I totally forgot...

296
00:22:09,555 --> 00:22:11,431
Yeah.

297
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:13,231
Sorry.

298
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:15,705
- May I borrow a cup of sugar?
- What?

299
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:19,468
<i>I never gave it much thought</i>
<i>until I put up a fresh pot of coffee.</i>

300
00:22:19,556 --> 00:22:22,276
I was on my way to the store
and I thought Nick'd have sugar.

301
00:22:22,357 --> 00:22:24,791
You tell me your story, I leave, sugarless.

302
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,948
I come back, you put your penis on exhibition.

303
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,872
Although the coffee's probably gone bad
by now, I insist on following through.

304
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,154
It's like a Norman Rockwell painting.

305
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:34,388
What, my penis?

306
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,913
No. No, the sugar.

307
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:39,514
<i>Neighbors borrowing sugar from one another.</i>

308
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,477
It's very um... Andy Griffith.

309
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:43,275
Yeah.

310
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,159
<i>That's</i> Andy Griffith.
The penis thing is not very Mayberry.

311
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,799
No.

312
00:22:47,882 --> 00:22:49,838
Thanks for the sugar... sugar.

313
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:01,158
I wanted to try and catch the next show.

314
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:02,757
I don't go on again till eight.

315
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:10,361
Whew!

316
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:19,243
It's not nearly eight o'clock yet.

317
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:23,238
- The Boss wants to see you.
- Who...?

318
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:25,159
- The Boss.
- Who's The Boss?

319
00:23:25,248 --> 00:23:27,364
- The guy we work for.
- Jesus!

320
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:30,359
Come here and sit your punk ass down.

321
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,365
Go.

322
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,288
I'm not the guy you're looking for.
I don't live here.

323
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,326
Well, you look like the guy that lives here.

324
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:40,766
Then you don't know what he looks like.

325
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:42,728
He means to say you look like you live here.

326
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:44,928
Yeah, that's what I mean to say.

327
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,968
I look like I live here, but I don't.

328
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,520
I'm just visiting, I just got in this morning.

329
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:52,844
The cat I'm looking for, his name is uh...

330
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,289
- His name is Nick, man.
- Nick.

331
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:57,330
The cat's name is Nick. Now...

332
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:00,452
Who are you?

333
00:24:00,535 --> 00:24:01,853
I'm Slevin.

334
00:24:03,455 --> 00:24:05,207
You got some ID?

335
00:24:08,335 --> 00:24:10,896
The funny thing about that is
I got mugged this morning.

336
00:24:10,977 --> 00:24:12,490
Look, look.

337
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,329
Tell it to the One Legged Man.

338
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:16,373
So he can bump it off down the road.

339
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:28,013
- Hey, listen, motherfucker...
- Yo, I got this.

340
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,489
- Slow, slow, slow, slow your roll, man.
- I got this.

341
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,731
Just let me. Just let me, all right?

342
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:34,698
Motherfucker!

343
00:24:34,781 --> 00:24:37,614
All I know is,
The Boss slides me this here address,

344
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:39,658
and he says, "Sloe" - that's him.

345
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:41,300
"Elvis" - that's me.

346
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:43,897
"Bring me the cat
who resides at this here address."

347
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,495
Now he told me that today.

348
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,938
You just so happen to be here today.

349
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:51,175
So I guess you the cat I'm supposed to pick up.

350
00:24:51,984 --> 00:24:52,939
Today.

351
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,582
But I'm not Nick.

352
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:56,336
Yeah, well, unfortunately for you,

353
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:59,542
you're not the first cat to tell me
you wasn't the guy I was looking for.

354
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:03,298
You can ask Lindsey, she lives across the hall.
She lives here.

355
00:25:03,386 --> 00:25:05,582
Hold on, man, I ain't asking nobody nothing.

356
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:08,056
Nick, Slevin, Clark Kent -
whatever your name is.

357
00:25:08,147 --> 00:25:10,980
The Virgin Mary could come waltzing up
with her fine ass,

358
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:12,740
titties hanging out and everything.

359
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:17,425
If she told me your name was Jesus Christ, I
still gotta take you to see The Boss. Know why?

360
00:25:17,508 --> 00:25:18,498
No.

361
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:20,545
Orders.

362
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:22,860
Now, you do know what orders is, right?

363
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,145
Orders is <i>orders.</i>

364
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,702
So I guess no-one ever taught you not to use
the word you're defining in the definition?

365
00:25:35,552 --> 00:25:39,147
Say something else, I will break
your motherfucking nose. I ain't playing.

366
00:25:39,912 --> 00:25:41,869
My nose is already broken.

367
00:25:48,394 --> 00:25:50,350
- Can I just say one more thing?
- <i>What?</i>

368
00:25:50,435 --> 00:25:52,902
Can you turn the heat up in here
cos it's really cold?

369
00:25:52,995 --> 00:25:55,509
Uh... yeah.

370
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:59,555
Y-You... You should have thought about that
before you started in with all the lip.

371
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:30,716
SLEVIN: Ah, Jeez. (Sighs)

372
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:45,076
- It's cold out there.
- Let's hurry it up, man.

373
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,363
Yo, grab his ass.

374
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:05,124
<i>The boss is right up there, chump.</i>

375
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:26,965
Well, listen.

376
00:27:27,051 --> 00:27:29,725
Your boys Elvis and Sloe
picked up the wrong guy.

377
00:27:30,892 --> 00:27:32,849
- I'm not Nick Fisher.
<i>- Mr. Fisher?</i>

378
00:27:34,573 --> 00:27:36,929
Are you familiar with The Shmoo, Mr. Fisher?

379
00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:39,930
A comic strip I liked as a boy.

380
00:27:40,654 --> 00:27:43,010
The Shmoo was a loveable creature, really.

381
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,847
<i>Laid eggs...</i>

382
00:27:45,616 --> 00:27:47,572
gave milk...

383
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:51,688
...and died of sheer ecstasy
when looked at with hunger.

384
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:55,613
The Shmoo loved to be eaten.

385
00:27:55,697 --> 00:27:57,847
It could taste like any food you desire.

386
00:27:58,858 --> 00:28:02,294
Shmoo hide, cut thin, made fine leather.

387
00:28:03,939 --> 00:28:06,692
<i>Even Shmoo whiskers</i>
<i>made excellent toothpicks.</i>

388
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:11,296
In essence, the Shmoo supplied
all of the world's wants.

389
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,218
I only bring up the Shmoo because it's relevant
to you and why you were brought here.

390
00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:18,620
I'm sorry, who are you?

391
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:20,180
I'm The Boss.

392
00:28:20,262 --> 00:28:21,979
I thought he was The Boss.

393
00:28:22,782 --> 00:28:23,737
Why?

394
00:28:24,582 --> 00:28:26,015
Do we look alike?

395
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:31,142
So, Mr. Fisher...
you were gonna tell me something?

396
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:33,180
I don't know, you brought me here.

397
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:34,583
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

398
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:36,620
Back when you thought I was him.

399
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:39,700
I never thought you were him.
I thought he was you.

400
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:42,744
I was trying to tell him, you...
that they picked up the wrong guy.

401
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:45,215
- Wrong guy for what?
- What you wanted to see me about.

402
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,297
- Know what I wanted to see you about?
- No.

403
00:28:47,386 --> 00:28:49,343
Then how do you know I have the wrong guy?

404
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,579
- Because I'm not...
- Maybe I wanted to give you $96,000.

405
00:28:52,668 --> 00:28:54,659
In that case, do I still have the wrong guy?

406
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:57,944
Do you want to give me $96,000?

407
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,987
No, do you want to give <i>me</i> $96,000?

408
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:02,422
No, should I?

409
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,421
I don't know, should you?

410
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,626
I don't know, should I?

411
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:15,384
Long story short.

412
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:20,232
- I think we're well past that point.
- I'll bet it was that mouth that got you that nose.

413
00:29:23,313 --> 00:29:27,989
OK, I'm under the impression that you're
under the impression that I owe you $96,000.

414
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:30,429
No, you owe Slim Hopkins $96,000.

415
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:34,351
You owe Slim, Slim owes me.

416
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:36,514
You owe me.

417
00:29:41,797 --> 00:29:43,753
<i>Well, in that case, is Slim around?</i>

418
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:51,476
Hey, Slim. Do you know this cat?

419
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,554
Slim?

420
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,832
No use.

421
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,072
Ever since somebody shot him,
old Slim went deaf.

422
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,076
What happened to make Slim go deaf?

423
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:06,388
Why?

424
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:12,599
Because I owe you $96,000 and I might have
a slight problem coming up with the money.

425
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:14,035
Oh, OK.

426
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:17,479
Well, why don't we just make it an even 90?

427
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:21,633
I may have exaggerated the slightness.

428
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:24,439
Hm.

429
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:28,962
Well, why don't I just cancel the whole debt
in exchange for a small favor?

430
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:34,242
Well, that depends on the favor.

431
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:39,199
THE BOSS: <i>That was my son.</i>

432
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:42,204
Notice how I said "was"?

433
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:45,005
Yeah.

434
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:47,044
That's because he's dead.

435
00:30:48,088 --> 00:30:50,000
Murdered.

436
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:53,726
Relegated to the past tense.

437
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:59,480
Sent from an <i>is</i> to a <i>was</i>
before he'd had his breakfast.

438
00:31:00,531 --> 00:31:02,283
Bummer.

439
00:31:08,612 --> 00:31:10,568
Lex Talionis.

440
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:12,927
The Law of Retaliation.

441
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:29,932
<i>A pact was broken.</i>

442
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:33,692
My son was murdered,
so The Rabbi's son must share the same fate.

443
00:31:34,577 --> 00:31:36,135
Whose son?

444
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:37,855
The Rabbi's.

445
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,894
Why do they call him The Rabbi?

446
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:41,297
Because...

447
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:45,612
Because he's a rabbi.

448
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:47,655
Who's his son?

449
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,299
- Yitzchok.
- Yitzchok. Yitzchok and The Rabbi.

450
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,371
Yitzchok the Fairy.

451
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,697
Why do they call him The Fairy?

452
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:00,897
Because he's a fairy.

453
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:04,258
He has wings, can fly?
Sprinkles magic dust all over the place?

454
00:32:04,342 --> 00:32:06,298
- He's homosexual.
- Right.

455
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,339
Come on.

456
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:14,058
- So how does The Rabbi feel about that?
- He doesn't know.

457
00:32:14,144 --> 00:32:16,294
- You know, but he doesn't?
- Everybody knows.

458
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,136
- Except The Rabbi.
- That's right.

459
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:20,901
So where do I fit in?

460
00:32:20,985 --> 00:32:22,578
You?

461
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:25,942
You're the trigger man.

462
00:32:27,386 --> 00:32:28,786
Me?

463
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,618
You.

464
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:41,267
Aren't there professionals?
People you can hire to do this sort of thing?

465
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,940
Of course there are.

466
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,985
Yes.

467
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:47,986
But you owe me $96,000.

468
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,030
Why should I go out and pay someone else
when I've already paid you?

469
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:58,062
Hm. Sorry, kid,
but your money just isn't long enough.

470
00:32:58,151 --> 00:32:59,631
Which means you're in my pocket.

471
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:02,352
Which means
if you don't do what I want you to do,

472
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:04,901
you're gonna go from my pocket to my fridge.

473
00:33:06,913 --> 00:33:08,870
Slim could use the company.

474
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,751
I could use the Shmoo.

475
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:12,904
So I'll expect your answer by morning.

476
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:16,431
Is there anything else?

477
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:20,711
Well, I don't suppose I have to say anything
as trite and clichéd as,

478
00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:22,912
"Go to the police and you're a dead man."

479
00:33:22,996 --> 00:33:25,227
I think you just did.

480
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:26,796
I guess I did.

481
00:33:30,518 --> 00:33:33,271
So, let me see if I've got this right.

482
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,595
I'm paying you a lot of money to kill somebody
and you're getting somebody else to do it?

483
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,559
Don't worry.

484
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:46,556
I'm gonna kill somebody.

485
00:33:52,842 --> 00:33:54,434
Better call Brikowski.

486
00:33:54,522 --> 00:33:56,080
Tell him there's a new face in town.

487
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:34,286
- Hey.
- Nick still hasn't shown, huh?

488
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:36,201
- No.
- What's with you and that towel?

489
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,847
Oh... Lindsey...

490
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:42,000
- It's a very long story.
- Get dressed, and tell me about it on the way.

491
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,365
Where are we going?

492
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:46,284
All we know is that somebody called Nick
from the Hotel Cheval.

493
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:48,328
<i>I spoke to a friend who works there.</i>

494
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:50,368
<i>They keep a record of every call made.</i>

495
00:34:50,452 --> 00:34:54,730
<i>She can access the computer and we can</i>
<i>find out what room the call came from.</i>

496
00:34:54,813 --> 00:34:56,451
What is it?

497
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:58,490
- I know this guy.
<i>- Who?</i>

498
00:34:58,573 --> 00:34:59,972
This guy.

499
00:35:01,374 --> 00:35:03,330
You know that guy?

500
00:35:03,414 --> 00:35:05,326
Yeah, I met him.

501
00:35:05,415 --> 00:35:06,768
He was dead.

502
00:35:09,216 --> 00:35:11,172
You met a dead guy?

503
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:13,212
Yeah.

504
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:15,253
In a walk-in freezer.

505
00:35:18,777 --> 00:35:21,850
Bookmaker Slim Hopkins reported missing.
Police have no leads.

506
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:23,496
Blah, blah, blah. Yada, yada...

507
00:35:23,578 --> 00:35:27,458
A spokesperson commented off the record,
"Ironic that Hopkins should go missing,

508
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:32,169
considering he's allegedly been behind
a few disappearing acts himself."

509
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,332
I think it's time you told me that story
about why you're still wearing that towel.

510
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:41,776
- Do you mind if I get dressed first?
- (Phone rings)

511
00:35:41,861 --> 00:35:44,501
Could be my friend from the hotel. Be right back.

512
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:49,540
Hm.

513
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:03,415
Hey, Lindsey, I don't think it's such a good idea
that we continue to...

514
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,541
Put your shoes on, Schlomo wants to see you.

515
00:36:11,106 --> 00:36:13,063
I don't know anyone named Schlomo.

516
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:17,578
Someone named Schlomo knows you.
That is your only concern.

517
00:36:17,668 --> 00:36:19,021
Let's go.

518
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:20,861
Like I said, I don't know...

519
00:36:22,669 --> 00:36:24,625
Aaahh... better...

520
00:36:25,629 --> 00:36:28,190
I think it's better if you let me do the talking.

521
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,703
You think?

522
00:36:35,591 --> 00:36:38,105
What is it?

523
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:41,505
He's sorry that he hit you.

524
00:36:41,592 --> 00:36:43,549
- Do you always speak for him?
- <i>Yes.</i>

525
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,305
Hm.

526
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:49,350
So, he's a mute, then.

527
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:50,389
Not quite.

528
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,430
Well, what, then?

529
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:54,982
It's personal. You'll have to ask him.

530
00:36:55,075 --> 00:36:57,031
- Hm. How would he tell me?
- He wouldn't.

531
00:37:01,836 --> 00:37:03,747
- Hey, are we going to the...?
- No.

532
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:06,146
- But he's right there.
- A different outfit entirely.

533
00:37:07,597 --> 00:37:09,475
<i>Right across the street from one another?</i>

534
00:37:09,557 --> 00:37:13,710
At one time they were one with one another.
And then they tried to kill one another.

535
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:19,236
<i>And now neither man leaves</i>
<i>his respective tower of isolation</i>

536
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:21,674
for fear of what the other man will do to him.

537
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:32,517
Let me guess, all the way up?

538
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:37,238
Penthouse.

539
00:37:44,404 --> 00:37:46,360
Gentle piano music

540
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:06,917
You must be Mr. Fisher.

541
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,320
Must I? Because... that hasn't been
working out for me lately.

542
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:15,048
- But I'm afraid you must.
- Well, if I must.

543
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,605
Do you know for what reason
you've been brought here?

544
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:23,883
For starters, I'm unlucky.

545
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:27,805
The unlucky are nothing more than
a frame of reference for the lucky, Mr. Fisher.

546
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:30,645
You are unlucky so I may know that I am not.

547
00:38:30,732 --> 00:38:34,168
Unfortunately, the lucky never realize
they are lucky until it's too late.

548
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:37,723
Take yourself for instance. Yesterday
you were better off than you are today,

549
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:42,968
but it took today for you to realize it. But...
today has arrived, and it's too late, you see?

550
00:38:44,415 --> 00:38:46,326
<i>People are never happy with what they have.</i>

551
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:50,725
They always want what they had,
or what someone else has.

552
00:38:50,815 --> 00:38:53,125
Kinda like a rabbi
who would rather be a gangster,

553
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:55,127
a gangster who would rather be a rabbi.

554
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:56,251
I mean, what is that?

555
00:38:56,337 --> 00:38:59,409
Some sort of grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence thing?

556
00:38:59,498 --> 00:39:02,649
<i>I mean, how do you justify being a rabbi</i>

557
00:39:02,738 --> 00:39:04,808
and a gangster?

558
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,291
I don't.

559
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:13,337
I'm a bad man who doesn't waste time
wondering what could've been,

560
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,411
when I am what could've been or not have been.

561
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,130
I live on both sides of the fence,
and my grass is always green.

562
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:21,737
Consider, Mr. Fisher...

563
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:24,252
...there are two men sitting here before you,

564
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:27,220
and one of them you should be very afraid of.
Where's my money?

565
00:39:28,503 --> 00:39:31,222
- I've been hearing that a lot lately.
- My father used to say,

566
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:33,897
"The first time somebody calls you a horse,
you punch him.

567
00:39:33,984 --> 00:39:36,623
The second time somebody calls you a horse,
call him a jerk.

568
00:39:36,703 --> 00:39:40,823
But the third time somebody calls you a horse,
perhaps it's time to go shopping for a saddle."

569
00:39:50,106 --> 00:39:53,782
- I don't have your money.
- This isn't like skipping out on the check.

570
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:57,143
You owe me money.
I have interests, you owe them money.

571
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,026
- I don't even know how much money I owe you.
- $33,000.

572
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,417
- But I'm not Nick fisher.
- Then who the hell are you?

573
00:40:02,508 --> 00:40:05,660
I'm just a guy who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

574
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,866
You have 48 hours to get my money.

575
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,182
Saul will keep an eye on you.
In the meantime, you may go now.

576
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:21,545
Wait, I just have one question.

577
00:40:23,112 --> 00:40:25,069
I wasn't frisked.

578
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:34,313
I see. So, being a rabbi, a... a religious man...

579
00:40:34,395 --> 00:40:38,593
There are three things a Jew may not do
in order to save a life, including his own.

580
00:40:38,675 --> 00:40:44,433
He may not idol-worship, commit adultery,
or perform an act of premeditated murder.

581
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:47,465
Killing you before you killed me
would have been...

582
00:40:47,556 --> 00:40:49,513
- Kosher.
- (Exhales)

583
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:53,513
Acceptable.

584
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:14,996
I've wired half the money
to your bank in the Caymans.

585
00:41:15,082 --> 00:41:18,200
The other half will be deposited
when our old friend is in the ground.

586
00:41:18,282 --> 00:41:20,239
Now I can expect that when?

587
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:26,799
- Very soon.
- Good.

588
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,478
So, tell me. The kid...

589
00:41:30,284 --> 00:41:32,241
<i>What do you want with him?</i>

590
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,475
The kid and I have unfinished business.

591
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:48,727
If there's one thing I know,
it's when someone is lying.

592
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:50,959
A man in my position, it's all he has to go on.

593
00:41:52,448 --> 00:41:55,919
To know a lie when he hears it,
it's the difference between life and death -

594
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:57,681
your own, someone else's.

595
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,728
That being said, he wasn't lying.

596
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,243
That's not Nick Fisher.

597
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:05,405
I know.

598
00:42:15,773 --> 00:42:20,086
I came back here, you were gone. So,
I went to the hotel without you to see my friend.

599
00:42:20,174 --> 00:42:23,007
She says the call to Nick came from Room 1009.

600
00:42:23,094 --> 00:42:26,724
A fellow registered under the name of Smith,
if you can believe that.

601
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:30,525
It's one of the most common names in the world,
so there's bound to be a couple of 'em.

602
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:32,811
But I get the feeling that this ain't one of 'em.

603
00:42:32,895 --> 00:42:35,808
I get up to the tenth floor, and just as I do,

604
00:42:35,896 --> 00:42:39,651
the door to room 1009 opens
and there's our Mr. Smith. In the flesh.

605
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:44,448
So, I pretend I'm walking to the elevator instead
of coming from it and we take it down together.

606
00:42:44,538 --> 00:42:46,574
He smiles at me - thanks - I smile back.

607
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:49,888
<i>But I have no idea who he is</i>
<i>but I think you might,</i>

608
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:53,176
<i>so I take a picture using my cell phone</i>
<i>which I thought was a total waste</i>

609
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,694
cos the photos look like shit and I never use it.

610
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:00,730
So there I am pretending to dial a number,
and taking Smith's picture - him none the wiser.

611
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:03,651
This is Smith. Recognize him?

612
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:04,491
No.

613
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:09,898
I didn't think you would, but it was worth a shot.
Anyway, we take the elevator to the lobby,

614
00:43:09,982 --> 00:43:13,692
and the man who calls himself Smith
walks outside and hails himself a cab.

615
00:43:13,783 --> 00:43:15,535
So I followed him.

616
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:24,017
<i>He went down</i>
<i>into an apartment building downtown.</i>

617
00:43:24,105 --> 00:43:26,175
<i>So I wait. An hour goes by.</i>

618
00:43:27,425 --> 00:43:30,463
And just when I'm getting ready to leave -
who walks outside?

619
00:43:30,546 --> 00:43:32,298
- Smith?
- You.

620
00:43:36,707 --> 00:43:37,457
Me?

621
00:43:39,347 --> 00:43:43,307
<i>You out of the same building</i>
<i>with two Hasidic Jews on either side of you.</i>

622
00:43:44,268 --> 00:43:46,100
Friends of yours?

623
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:48,508
Not exactly.

624
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,740
I think it's time you told me that story.

625
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:55,188
Well, there's this guy
and they call him The Boss, right?

626
00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:59,507
And then, right across the street
there's this man they call The Rabbi.

627
00:43:59,592 --> 00:44:02,629
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

628
00:44:10,113 --> 00:44:13,026
So now I have to "take out",
to use the vernacular,

629
00:44:13,114 --> 00:44:15,913
The Fairy, in order to scratch a debt
that isn't even mine.

630
00:44:15,994 --> 00:44:21,592
And if that's not enough, I have 48 hours to
come up with $33,000 or The Rabbi's gonna...

631
00:44:22,556 --> 00:44:24,512
I don't know who Mr. Smith is.

632
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:28,230
And the worst part about it is,
I'm not Nick Fisher.

633
00:44:28,997 --> 00:44:29,747
Ironic.

634
00:44:30,757 --> 00:44:32,396
I know, I don't even gamble.

635
00:44:32,477 --> 00:44:35,514
No, I mean the mobster having a gay son.
That's ironic.

636
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:41,117
We are dealing with a bona fide case
of mistaken identity here.

637
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:44,908
Things like that aren't supposed to be real.
It's like amnesia.

638
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:49,118
Notwithstanding, here you are,
and Nick's nowhere to be found, so...

639
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,396
I'd say you're fucked.

640
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,392
Fucked.

641
00:44:56,842 --> 00:44:58,958
Shouldn't you be a little worried about this?

642
00:44:59,043 --> 00:45:01,238
I have Ataraxia.

643
00:45:01,322 --> 00:45:02,472
Ataraxia?

644
00:45:03,563 --> 00:45:08,592
It's a condition characterized by freedom
from worry or any other preoccupation really.

645
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:13,074
I have to have my answer
to The Boss in the morning.

646
00:45:13,164 --> 00:45:15,121
Oh, what are you gonna say?

647
00:45:16,445 --> 00:45:19,039
What a man with two penises would say
when his tailor asks him

648
00:45:19,126 --> 00:45:21,594
- if he dresses to the right or to the left.
- What's that?

649
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:25,043
Yes.

650
00:45:25,967 --> 00:45:27,923
I knew you had sense.

651
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:32,241
Sense is something you have
when you have a choice.

652
00:45:32,328 --> 00:45:34,080
Sometimes.

653
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:36,524
Sometimes it's when you know you don't.

654
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:41,405
Nah, don't move that bishop!
It's an obvious sucker bet.

655
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,638
If you don't, y-y-you can have him in four moves.

656
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,040
If you do, he's gonna have you in mate in one.

657
00:45:49,931 --> 00:45:51,445
He doesn't see it.

658
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:54,092
Wouldn't matter if he did.

659
00:45:54,172 --> 00:45:55,606
Elvis lets me win.

660
00:45:56,773 --> 00:45:58,809
<i>Everybody lets me win.</i>

661
00:45:59,573 --> 00:46:02,406
Wait a minute. You know this game?

662
00:46:09,495 --> 00:46:11,167
THE BOSS: You got three days.

663
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,614
I was thinking it would take me a week.

664
00:46:14,695 --> 00:46:17,085
Oh, you were thinking that, were you?

665
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:21,216
With all your experience killing people?
I'll tell you what.

666
00:46:23,297 --> 00:46:25,208
You win this game, you got your week.

667
00:46:29,618 --> 00:46:30,256
Hm.

668
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,179
THE BOSS: So, what's the plan with Yitzchok?

669
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:46,300
Was gonna play it by ear.

670
00:46:46,381 --> 00:46:49,419
Well, if it's all the same,
I'd write it down. It's a tough tune.

671
00:46:50,902 --> 00:46:52,894
And, by the way, he has shadows.

672
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:58,336
Shadows?

673
00:47:02,265 --> 00:47:03,936
Bodyguards.

674
00:47:04,664 --> 00:47:06,621
With him all the time.

675
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,223
Military.

676
00:47:15,106 --> 00:47:17,063
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

677
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:22,347
THE BOSS: They go where he goes,
round-the-clock. Ex-Israeli Mossad.

678
00:47:22,428 --> 00:47:24,384
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

679
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:28,058
That doesn't sound good.

680
00:47:29,229 --> 00:47:31,379
<i>They live in the apartment next door.</i>

681
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:34,466
He wears a panic button on a chain
around his neck.

682
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,587
<i>Looks like an ordinary Star of David.</i>

683
00:47:37,431 --> 00:47:40,662
He presses that button
and, well, we all know how that ends.

684
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:42,104
What's this?

685
00:47:43,232 --> 00:47:44,300
Oh, God! No, you didn't?

686
00:47:47,273 --> 00:47:48,945
- Get down!
- (Silenced gunshot)

687
00:47:50,593 --> 00:47:52,789
<i>Response time's gonna be</i>
<i>three to five seconds.</i>

688
00:47:53,514 --> 00:47:55,709
He's gonna have to hit him
when he least expects it.

689
00:47:55,794 --> 00:47:57,750
Where?

690
00:47:57,834 --> 00:48:00,554
- Where?
- The apartment.

691
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:05,470
How do I get in his apartment?
I can't just walk in the front door.

692
00:48:06,196 --> 00:48:08,471
No, I was thinking you'd use the back door.

693
00:48:15,718 --> 00:48:17,709
Then what?

694
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:19,948
He does the kid, I do him.

695
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:23,307
I plant my gun. Clean, no history.

696
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:27,393
And Yitzchok - fire a round,
get some powder burns on the hands.

697
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,270
Take the clothes off- make it look like a,

698
00:48:32,361 --> 00:48:36,878
"You do me, I do you, we're both gay, the
world doesn't understand us," double suicide.

699
00:48:38,162 --> 00:48:39,914
And that's all there is to it.

700
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:43,072
Is that all there is to it?

701
00:48:43,163 --> 00:48:45,552
Yeah. It's all there is to it.

702
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,034
Peww!

703
00:48:57,925 --> 00:48:59,962
I'm not such a bad guy, you know.

704
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,756
<i>Some folks have grown pretty fat off me.</i>

705
00:49:06,407 --> 00:49:08,363
Some have grown pretty dead.

706
00:49:12,768 --> 00:49:14,167
You're a conundrum, you.

707
00:49:16,409 --> 00:49:20,846
You walk in here shooting your fucking mouth off
like you don't give a fuck if it gets shot off.

708
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,443
You can only kill me once.

709
00:49:31,131 --> 00:49:31,882
Checkmate.

710
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:40,089
Nobody says I have to kill you quick.

711
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:45,086
Cat.

712
00:49:46,134 --> 00:49:47,886
Mouse.

713
00:49:49,495 --> 00:49:51,451
You've got three days.

714
00:49:55,255 --> 00:49:57,212
Excuse me.

715
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:18,738
Who the fuck is this guy?

716
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,011
<i>Dunno. But whoever he is, he's either in</i>
<i>very deep shit or I don't know what,</i>

717
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:27,777
because he's playing in the sandbox with
the Darkies, the Skullcaps and who knows who.

718
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:31,741
Call Murph and see if he got a match
on that photo Marty snapped.

719
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:33,814
Yes, boss.

720
00:50:33,903 --> 00:50:37,179
I want a complete rundown on this fucker.
Everything from A to Z.

721
00:50:37,263 --> 00:50:40,141
Who he is. Who does he know?
The people he knows, who do they know?

722
00:50:40,224 --> 00:50:43,581
I want to know
what the fuck he is doing in my fucking city.

723
00:50:53,306 --> 00:50:54,739
- What have you got?
- Get this.

724
00:50:54,826 --> 00:50:57,216
The Kat's in town.

725
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:58,456
Good Kat?

726
00:50:58,547 --> 00:51:01,108
- It's the song junkies are singing.
- What's the happenstance?

727
00:51:01,188 --> 00:51:04,350
Didn't know the happenstance.
Just said the word was the Kat's in town.

728
00:51:04,363 --> 00:51:06,593
Um... who's er... who's Good Kat?

729
00:51:06,683 --> 00:51:09,117
<i>Real heavy hitter.</i>

730
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:12,114
- The heaviest.
- He shows, people die, he vanishes.

731
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,636
No-one knows who he is, or what he looks like.

732
00:51:14,723 --> 00:51:17,600
And he hasn't worked New York
in, like, two decades.

733
00:51:17,682 --> 00:51:19,638
<i>Just what we need.</i>

734
00:51:19,722 --> 00:51:20,836
All right.

735
00:51:21,602 --> 00:51:26,550
And get some different fucking coffee in here,
will you? I gotta get to the fucking morgue.

736
00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:37,199
- Hey! I figured it out.
- Hey. What did you figure out?

737
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,714
You said that Slim Hopkins worked
for The Boss, right?

738
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,518
Well, listen.

739
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,430
The Rabbi also had a bookie - Benny Begin.

740
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,192
Benny's at the morgue.
Somebody killed him and his goons.

741
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,429
- The morgue?
- Didn't I say I was a coroner?

742
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:50,192
No, you didn't say you were a coroner.

743
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,075
Benny Begin - killed by a baseball.

744
00:51:55,799 --> 00:51:57,517
My guess was a fastball.

745
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:02,435
Well, either way it proves
that the good Lord has a sense of humor.

746
00:52:02,518 --> 00:52:04,236
- Good morning, Detective.
- Morning.

747
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:07,435
- You know this guy?
- Big-time bookie. Worked for The Rabbi.

748
00:52:07,518 --> 00:52:10,351
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

749
00:52:10,438 --> 00:52:12,269
Between you and me...

750
00:52:13,117 --> 00:52:16,746
20 years ago he used to be my bookie.
I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.

751
00:52:18,077 --> 00:52:20,636
What about the other two?
Did you get anything on them yet?

752
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:22,594
These two were poisoned.

753
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:25,032
Something exotic.

754
00:52:25,116 --> 00:52:27,391
- I'm running it down.
- Well, let me know.

755
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:29,228
<i>Will do.</i>

756
00:52:29,956 --> 00:52:30,706
Prick.

757
00:52:34,516 --> 00:52:37,268
- Have a good day.
- You too, Detective.

758
00:52:41,795 --> 00:52:43,672
Jimmy, I'm taking my lunch break.

759
00:52:45,475 --> 00:52:48,784
Don't you see?
Nick isn't missing, he's hiding. He set you up.

760
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,627
- Nick set me up?
- Like a bowling pin.

761
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:53,182
Nick found himself in a jam.
He got you to take his place.

762
00:52:53,274 --> 00:52:56,788
He paid a street thug to mug you,
but all he wants is your wallet and license

763
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:58,626
<i>so he ignores the watch and suitcase.</i>

764
00:52:58,713 --> 00:53:00,465
<i>Then Nick kills Slim Hopkins and Benny,</i>

765
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:03,989
the only guys who know what he looks like,
and now you're left holding the bag!

766
00:53:04,073 --> 00:53:07,622
- But I called Nick. I initiated contact.
- Well, maybe it just seems that way.

767
00:53:07,713 --> 00:53:10,386
- What about Smith?
- I still can't figure him out in all this.

768
00:53:10,473 --> 00:53:11,792
Hm.

769
00:53:11,872 --> 00:53:14,181
- You should run.
- I can't.

770
00:53:14,273 --> 00:53:16,945
- They'll kill you if you stay.
- They'll kill me if I leave.

771
00:53:17,032 --> 00:53:19,910
- Go to the police!
- These guys buy cops like cops buy doughnuts.

772
00:53:19,991 --> 00:53:21,948
This isn't the first time this has happened.

773
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:25,387
This isn't the first time a crime lord asked you
to kill the gay son of a rival

774
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:29,020
to pay off a friend's debt whose place you're
staying in because you lost your job

775
00:53:29,111 --> 00:53:31,022
and found your girlfriend with another guy?

776
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:35,787
It is the first time it happened. But Nick has been
painting me into a corner since we were kids.

777
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:38,065
I guess I've always been a better friend to him...

778
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:41,903
Yeah, I'd love to hear the rest of this
but I've really gotta go back to work.

779
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:46,060
- Oh, hey. Hey.
- Hey.

780
00:53:46,149 --> 00:53:50,665
I was just thinking that if you're still alive
when I get back from work tonight, maybe...

781
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:54,264
I don't know,
we could go to dinner or something?

782
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:59,502
Yeah, that would be great, yeah.

783
00:53:59,588 --> 00:54:01,545
- Really?
- Yeah.

784
00:54:01,628 --> 00:54:03,107
- (Chuckles)
- Yeah.

785
00:54:03,188 --> 00:54:06,100
OK. Um... No. Bye.

786
00:54:11,308 --> 00:54:13,060
Hm...

787
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:15,615
Weird.

788
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:26,825
What?

789
00:54:26,906 --> 00:54:30,945
I was just thinking about what it would be like
if we'd met under different circumstances.

790
00:54:31,026 --> 00:54:34,938
See, I think people should only fall in love
if there's a great story behind how they met.

791
00:54:35,785 --> 00:54:38,618
You know, seeing as you have to tell it
over and over again.

792
00:54:39,666 --> 00:54:43,101
If you and I fell in love,
we'd have one hell of a story to tell.

793
00:54:43,185 --> 00:54:46,257
We'd be at a dinner party and someone
would ask, "How'd you two meet?"

794
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:51,465
And I'd say, "You tell the story, dear."
And you'd say, "No, you tell it better."

795
00:54:54,864 --> 00:54:56,092
So, come here often?

796
00:54:58,464 --> 00:55:01,773
No. But I heard about someone who does.

797
00:55:04,063 --> 00:55:05,894
- You mean... The Fairy?
- Yeah.

798
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,939
- Is he...?
- Yeah.

799
00:55:08,702 --> 00:55:09,452
Where?

800
00:55:15,822 --> 00:55:17,494
This is absurd. What are you thinking?

801
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:20,660
- I'm thinking of a new option.
- What?

802
00:55:20,742 --> 00:55:22,573
- Talking with him.
- Talking with him?

803
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:23,333
Talking.

804
00:55:23,422 --> 00:55:27,381
You're gonna go over and say, "I'm Slevin,
some bad dudes think I am someone I am not.

805
00:55:27,461 --> 00:55:30,259
And I'm gonna have to take you out
or they're gonna take me out

806
00:55:30,341 --> 00:55:32,490
and I was wondering,
you wanna talk about it?"

807
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:34,617
- I can't do that.
- You think?

808
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:37,215
Look, I can't just walk over there.
He's got bodyguards.

809
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,019
Aside from that, you're pretty much dead-on.

810
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,809
- Bodyguards?
- Yeah. Right behind him. Two of them. Israelis.

811
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,371
Beards. Right behind him.

812
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,255
<i>See 'em?</i>

813
00:55:51,939 --> 00:55:53,975
- You're getting good at this.
- Thanks.

814
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,777
How are you gonna have a talk with him?

815
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:58,134
When he goes to the bathroom,
I'll follow him in.

816
00:55:58,979 --> 00:56:00,935
What do you think?

817
00:56:01,819 --> 00:56:03,968
<i>Could someone tell me why I'm in the van?</i>

818
00:56:05,418 --> 00:56:07,534
<i>Because I could only get a reservation for two.</i>

819
00:56:08,818 --> 00:56:11,491
<i>All right, The Fairy's at a table in the middle.</i>

820
00:56:11,578 --> 00:56:12,930
<i>Bodyguards nearby.</i>

821
00:56:13,018 --> 00:56:16,896
<i>Our boy's not far away</i>
<i>but I can't make out who's with him.</i>

822
00:56:16,977 --> 00:56:20,526
- <i>Did Murph get a beat on him yet?</i>
<i>- Murph says, whoever he is, he's a ghost.</i>

823
00:56:20,617 --> 00:56:24,132
<i>Can't find anyone who's ever even</i>
<i>bumped into him, much less tripped over him.</i>

824
00:56:28,856 --> 00:56:31,006
<i>The Fairy's going to the bathroom.</i>

825
00:56:34,616 --> 00:56:36,924
<i>And our boy's making a move. Shit.</i>

826
00:56:57,734 --> 00:57:00,042
- Marty, the door's locked.
- <i>Relax.</i>

827
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:02,773
It's not gonna go down in the men's room.

828
00:57:06,653 --> 00:57:08,609
I got it next.

829
00:57:11,372 --> 00:57:13,443
- What went down in the men's room?
- We talked.

830
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:14,282
And?

831
00:57:14,372 --> 00:57:16,363
I told him I thought we should get together.

832
00:57:16,452 --> 00:57:17,805
- You didn't?
- I did.

833
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,723
And?

834
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:22,645
- I got a date.
- Do you think this is safe?

835
00:57:22,732 --> 00:57:26,610
It can't be any worse than what's waiting for me
behind door number two.

836
00:57:27,771 --> 00:57:29,966
It's gonna be tough. I think I picked up a pigtail.

837
00:57:30,051 --> 00:57:32,167
- A what?
- The cops.

838
00:57:32,251 --> 00:57:35,402
Oh, a pig tail. Cute.

839
00:57:37,251 --> 00:57:39,559
I ran into a nosy cop in the men's room.

840
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:50,405
You and me need to talk.

841
00:57:53,449 --> 00:57:56,441
- Do I know you?
- No, but I know you.

842
00:58:03,768 --> 00:58:05,759
Listen, I'm sorry, no offence, but I'm not...

843
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,486
I'm not gay.

844
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:11,561
- I'm a cop.
- Well, I'm not a robber if you catch my drift?

845
00:58:12,527 --> 00:58:14,279
I've been watching you.

846
00:58:14,368 --> 00:58:18,963
I know what you're into.
Who are you? I mean, I know who you're not.

847
00:58:19,047 --> 00:58:21,686
You're not Nick Fisher.
The guy whose apartment you're in.

848
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:24,406
I know because Nick
spent eight years in Dade Correctional

849
00:58:24,487 --> 00:58:27,320
for forcing himself on a 14-year-old cheerleader.

850
00:58:27,407 --> 00:58:29,362
Dade County sent me a picture of Nick Fisher.

851
00:58:29,446 --> 00:58:31,323
And you... are not him.

852
00:58:31,406 --> 00:58:34,682
So... who the fuck are you?

853
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:41,041
I'm just a guy whose dinner's getting cold.

854
00:58:42,245 --> 00:58:44,076
May I leave now?

855
00:58:44,165 --> 00:58:45,837
- Come here.
- What?

856
00:58:45,925 --> 00:58:50,874
Dead bodies in refrigerators. Cops in men's
rooms. You remind me of... James Bond.

857
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,519
That is the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

858
00:58:57,604 --> 00:58:59,481
And The Boss, he could be Kananga.

859
00:58:59,563 --> 00:59:00,313
Kananga?

860
00:59:01,924 --> 00:59:04,198
- No, The Boss is no Kananga.
- Well, who's The Boss?

861
00:59:04,283 --> 00:59:06,239
Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

862
00:59:07,124 --> 00:59:10,559
Which one? Donald Pleasance?
Telly Savalas? Max von Sydow?

863
00:59:11,443 --> 00:59:14,832
You know your Bond.
But alas, I was referring to Anthony Dawson.

864
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:16,480
Who?

865
00:59:16,562 --> 00:59:19,156
Well, he played Blofeld
in From Russia With Love.

866
00:59:19,242 --> 00:59:22,552
Well, you never see Blofeld's face
in From Russia With Love.

867
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:26,839
And that's when the villain is most effective,
when you don't know what he looks like.

868
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,756
So...

869
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,355
See you later.

870
01:00:16,118 --> 01:00:19,076
SLEVIN: Ah, that was incredible!
- (Giggles) You...

871
01:00:22,277 --> 01:00:25,234
- I just realized something.
- What's that?

872
01:00:25,317 --> 01:00:28,308
- I just made love to you.
- You're just realizing that now?

873
01:00:28,396 --> 01:00:32,753
And I have no idea who specifically you were
referring to when you said James Bond.

874
01:00:32,836 --> 01:00:36,954
Because earlier when you were telling me
that I reminded you of James Bond,

875
01:00:37,035 --> 01:00:41,028
and I was saying that it was the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me,

876
01:00:41,115 --> 01:00:42,150
I naturally assumed...

877
01:00:42,235 --> 01:00:45,307
You naturally assumed
you knew who I was talking about.

878
01:00:50,594 --> 01:00:55,065
Because if you don't - if you weren't talking
about the guy I think that you're talking about,

879
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:59,909
well, you have me mistaken for somebody else,
because in my mind there is only one Bond.

880
01:01:00,834 --> 01:01:03,064
Well, on that we agree.

881
01:01:05,314 --> 01:01:06,587
Same time on three.

882
01:01:06,674 --> 01:01:08,311
- One...
- Two...

883
01:01:08,393 --> 01:01:10,145
- Three. George Lazenby.
- Roger Moore.

884
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,507
- George Lazenby?
- Roger Moore? I was kidding.

885
01:01:12,593 --> 01:01:14,072
- Yeah, I was kidding.
- You were?

886
01:01:14,152 --> 01:01:16,109
The only James Bond is...

887
01:01:16,192 --> 01:01:18,228
- Timothy Dalton.
- Pierce Brosnan.

888
01:01:21,352 --> 01:01:23,547
- Scotland forever.
- I feel so much better.

889
01:01:55,389 --> 01:01:57,345
Why are you going?

890
01:01:58,029 --> 01:01:59,985
I'm just going to get us some coffee.

891
01:02:00,989 --> 01:02:02,741
OK.

892
01:02:06,029 --> 01:02:07,984
Hurry back to me.

893
01:02:08,748 --> 01:02:10,101
WENDY RENE: After Laughter

894
01:02:10,188 --> 01:02:17,138
When you're in love, you're happy

895
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:21,780
Oh, and when you're in her arms

896
01:02:21,867 --> 01:02:26,894
You gain

897
01:02:28,706 --> 01:02:31,140
After...

898
01:02:31,226 --> 01:02:33,182
Hey! Police.

899
01:02:33,266 --> 01:02:35,222
Aw, come on, man.

900
01:02:35,306 --> 01:02:37,774
I already talked to your buddy.

901
01:02:38,585 --> 01:02:42,373
After...
After your laughter

902
01:02:46,065 --> 01:02:48,420
Good morning. I'm Detective Dumbrowski.

903
01:02:48,505 --> 01:02:50,655
Good morning, Detective.
Am I being kidnapped?

904
01:02:50,745 --> 01:02:53,736
Nope. We just want to have
a quick, friendly word with you.

905
01:02:53,824 --> 01:02:57,339
Is this standard operating procedure
you'd find in the policeman's manual

906
01:02:57,425 --> 01:02:58,937
if you look up "quick, friendly word"?

907
01:02:59,024 --> 01:03:01,617
There is no SOP for the box
you got yourself into.

908
01:03:01,704 --> 01:03:03,057
Oh.

909
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:10,141
- So what do you want to talk to me about?
- You.

910
01:03:10,223 --> 01:03:12,339
- What about me?
- Who are you?

911
01:03:12,423 --> 01:03:13,935
- Philosophically speaking?
- Name.

912
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,490
- Rank, serial number...
- You should really play ball.

913
01:03:16,582 --> 01:03:18,539
You think I'm tall enough?

914
01:03:28,621 --> 01:03:32,136
- What is your name?
- Oh, yeah, I remember. Slevin Kelevra.

915
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:34,451
K-E-L-E-V-R-A.

916
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:37,260
- Kelevra.
- <i>Look, kid,</i>

917
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:40,333
I don't know what's going on,
or how you're into this,

918
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:42,889
but when I figure out what there is to figure out,

919
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,811
I'm not gonna be so nice to you.

920
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,850
Oh, this is nice. Don't do me any favors.

921
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,095
<i>Last chance to come clean.</i>

922
01:03:57,659 --> 01:03:59,615
Take a walk.

923
01:04:00,779 --> 01:04:03,576
I think this is the part
where you tell me not to walk too far.

924
01:04:50,015 --> 01:04:53,211
When you're in love

925
01:04:53,295 --> 01:04:57,173
You're happy

926
01:04:57,774 --> 01:05:01,686
Oh, and when you're in her arms

927
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:06,563
You gain

928
01:05:08,693 --> 01:05:13,562
After
This doesn't matter...

929
01:05:13,653 --> 01:05:15,006
I have to go to work.

930
01:05:16,053 --> 01:05:18,008
Hey.

931
01:05:18,612 --> 01:05:20,568
After
After...

932
01:05:43,851 --> 01:05:46,808
- Hey, guys, what are you doing here?
- Now's the time.

933
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:50,125
I've got at least... Jesus.

934
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:53,485
The Boss says he wants you to look nice
for The Fairy.

935
01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:10,515
You're early.

936
01:07:13,403 --> 01:07:17,236
Why don't you come in and fix yourself a drink?
I was just getting ready.

937
01:07:28,681 --> 01:07:30,354
<i>You'll have to excuse the...</i>

938
01:07:30,441 --> 01:07:32,193
I wasn't expecting you for...

939
01:07:35,121 --> 01:07:36,873
<i>You look good.</i>

940
01:07:37,681 --> 01:07:39,989
<i>- You want some wine?</i>
- No.

941
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,037
Is something the matter?

942
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,238
Somebody's trying to kill you.

943
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,952
Who?

944
01:07:53,879 --> 01:07:54,869
Me.

945
01:08:46,515 --> 01:08:48,870
- That was close.
- Yeah.

946
01:10:04,389 --> 01:10:05,424
Close.

947
01:11:25,582 --> 01:11:27,538
THE BOSS: <i>I hired you to do a job.</i>

948
01:11:29,062 --> 01:11:31,098
It wasn't supposed to look like a job.

949
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:38,015
So you take out the Israelis,
bomb the damn building...

950
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:43,057
and now the job
that was not supposed to look like a job's

951
01:11:43,141 --> 01:11:45,370
beginning to look very much

952
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,416
like a job.

953
01:11:56,019 --> 01:11:57,975
All right. Fuck it.

954
01:12:00,499 --> 01:12:02,455
If the Rabbi wants a war...

955
01:12:03,339 --> 01:12:05,806
...l'll give him a war.

956
01:12:12,818 --> 01:12:14,570
Saul.

957
01:12:17,178 --> 01:12:19,567
- Saul.

958
01:12:20,018 --> 01:12:22,213
<i>Saul, the phone's been...</i>

959
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:24,254
Oh.

960
01:12:24,337 --> 01:12:26,293
I thought you were Saul.

961
01:12:28,897 --> 01:12:31,127
People have been thinking I'm somebody else.

962
01:12:34,577 --> 01:12:37,010
Your predicament reminds me of a story.

963
01:12:37,096 --> 01:12:39,451
Hitchcock. North By Northwest.

964
01:12:40,295 --> 01:12:44,049
The movie where everybody thinks Cary Grant
is a man named George Kaplan,

965
01:12:44,135 --> 01:12:47,128
but the thing is there is no George Kaplan.
It's just a made-up name.

966
01:12:47,215 --> 01:12:49,570
But names, even made-up ones...

967
01:12:52,015 --> 01:12:54,245
...can bring about quite a bit of trouble.

968
01:12:56,174 --> 01:12:57,574
Now...

969
01:12:57,654 --> 01:12:59,804
the woman in the picture with Grant,

970
01:12:59,894 --> 01:13:02,249
- <i>her name was er...</i>
- Eva Marie Saint.

971
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:05,087
- Oh... you know this movie.
- I know this movie.

972
01:13:05,174 --> 01:13:08,246
I took my father to see it in 1959.
His English wasn't very good,

973
01:13:08,334 --> 01:13:11,166
but boy, did he like Miss Saint.

974
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:14,051
After the movie he turned to me and he said,
"She's a real Buick."

975
01:13:14,133 --> 01:13:17,523
You see, he couldn't pronounce
the word beauty, so he'd say Buick.

976
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:22,566
- Caused quite a bit of confusion.
- Using the wrong name'll do that.

977
01:13:26,772 --> 01:13:28,603
Is that my money?

978
01:13:28,692 --> 01:13:30,045
This is everything I owe you.

979
01:14:03,289 --> 01:14:07,077
It's the Sabbath. You see,
we don't answer the phone on the Sabbath.

980
01:14:07,169 --> 01:14:08,965
I know.

981
01:14:09,049 --> 01:14:10,845
Normally Saul turns off the ringer.

982
01:14:10,929 --> 01:14:12,078
Saul!

983
01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:14,728
I tell you, you can't find good help these days.

984
01:14:18,567 --> 01:14:20,763
Saul's dead.

985
01:14:23,447 --> 01:14:24,675
<i>They're all dead.</i>

986
01:14:48,165 --> 01:14:50,122
Oh, I've been in this room before.

987
01:14:52,565 --> 01:14:54,521
Looks the same as it did 20 years ago.

988
01:14:55,765 --> 01:14:57,720
Somehow...

989
01:14:58,564 --> 01:14:59,917
Somehow it seems different.

990
01:15:00,005 --> 01:15:03,633
The way your car seems different
when someone else is driving it.

991
01:15:04,884 --> 01:15:07,921
Then again, it's been 20 years
since I've been in a car.

992
01:15:09,163 --> 01:15:12,201
Two decades spent behind three inches
of bulletproof glass

993
01:15:12,283 --> 01:15:16,879
due to a natural fear of high-powered rifles
and quiet... rooftops in New Jersey.

994
01:15:16,963 --> 01:15:18,919
20 years...

995
01:15:20,843 --> 01:15:24,119
...locked away in my own paranoia,
a prisoner in my own home.

996
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:29,275
Only to be delivered to fate by a boy.

997
01:15:32,881 --> 01:15:37,033
<i>Well, Anthony, it looks as though you've won,</i>
<i>if such a term may be applied.</i>

998
01:15:39,361 --> 01:15:41,636
<i>If I were wearing a hat, I would take it off.</i>

999
01:15:45,561 --> 01:15:47,118
Should we get on with it, then?

1000
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,356
You can keep your hat on, Schlomo.

1001
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:03,595
Looks like we were sold a bill of goods
by the same salesman.

1002
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:08,035
Nice speech, though.

1003
01:16:11,758 --> 01:16:13,988
I wish I was standing for it.

1004
01:16:24,598 --> 01:16:26,747
You... you brought this upon our heads.

1005
01:16:29,037 --> 01:16:32,996
- Me?
- You... you hired Good Kat to kill my son.

1006
01:16:34,877 --> 01:16:36,832
After you murdered my son?

1007
01:16:38,557 --> 01:16:41,309
- I had no hand in that.
- Oh, sure.

1008
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,352
Just like in '84?

1009
01:16:43,876 --> 01:16:47,312
I suppose you had no hand in that either.
Just a finger, maybe?

1010
01:16:49,956 --> 01:16:51,911
Time's up, Rabbi.

1011
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:56,307
Lying to a dead man's
the same as lying to yourself.

1012
01:17:00,154 --> 01:17:02,111
You were getting too big.

1013
01:17:03,914 --> 01:17:05,870
See...

1014
01:17:07,114 --> 01:17:09,150
...problem when two men are standing in a room

1015
01:17:09,233 --> 01:17:12,032
is you can only look at one of them
and they were looking at you

1016
01:17:12,113 --> 01:17:15,469
with their backs turned,
their shirt collars smiling at me.

1017
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,386
Then they called you The Boss.

1018
01:17:22,353 --> 01:17:24,308
It was clear what had to be done.

1019
01:17:30,552 --> 01:17:33,271
Try and appreciate how it feels, Schlomo...

1020
01:17:35,671 --> 01:17:39,425
...to wake up in the middle of the night
with six bullets burning in your stomach.

1021
01:17:40,271 --> 01:17:42,501
Lying in a pool of your own blood and shit.

1022
01:17:46,711 --> 01:17:48,666
The dead eyes of...

1023
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:54,504
...of your wife... staring back at you.

1024
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:00,106
The only thing keeping you from passing out

1025
01:18:00,190 --> 01:18:03,148
is the sound of the footsteps of the man
going down the hall...

1026
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:06,465
...looking for your son.

1027
01:18:11,468 --> 01:18:13,425
I managed to save my son, Schlomo.

1028
01:18:15,069 --> 01:18:17,024
And now...

1029
01:18:18,148 --> 01:18:20,184
...after all these years...

1030
01:18:22,027 --> 01:18:23,506
...in spite of our agreement!

1031
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:26,306
You... you...

1032
01:18:26,387 --> 01:18:29,265
fucking backstabbing Philistine.

1033
01:18:30,148 --> 01:18:32,217
You managed to take my son away from me.

1034
01:18:33,707 --> 01:18:35,663
Well...

1035
01:18:36,867 --> 01:18:38,903
...now I've taken your son away from you.

1036
01:18:38,986 --> 01:18:41,898
I told you I had nothing to do with...

1037
01:18:50,706 --> 01:18:52,536
You haven't heard.

1038
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:54,581
Will I?

1039
01:18:55,145 --> 01:18:58,693
Look at my face, Schlomo. Look at my smile.

1040
01:19:00,544 --> 01:19:02,182
Your son is dead.

1041
01:19:05,424 --> 01:19:07,493
Your son is dead.

1042
01:19:10,064 --> 01:19:12,577
I'm gonna kill you. Hm.

1043
01:19:14,823 --> 01:19:15,892
SLEVIN: <i>Rabbi.</i>

1044
01:19:17,143 --> 01:19:19,134
<i>Are you familiar with the Shmoo?</i>

1045
01:19:30,982 --> 01:19:32,938
Fisher.

1046
01:19:34,742 --> 01:19:36,697
Fisher, listen to me.

1047
01:19:39,421 --> 01:19:41,889
I already told you,

1048
01:19:41,982 --> 01:19:43,937
I'm not Nick Fisher.

1049
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:51,017
Then who is Nick Fisher?

1050
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,137
I think you mean, who was Nick Fisher?

1051
01:20:00,739 --> 01:20:02,537
Fisher was the answer to a question.

1052
01:20:02,619 --> 01:20:05,258
How do you get to two men
that can't be gotten to?

1053
01:20:12,898 --> 01:20:14,855
<i>You get them to come to you.</i>

1054
01:20:22,537 --> 01:20:24,971
<i>But to do that... I needed a name.</i>

1055
01:20:25,777 --> 01:20:27,848
<i>And where do you find names?</i>

1056
01:20:27,938 --> 01:20:29,928
<i>In books.</i>

1057
01:20:34,137 --> 01:20:35,649
<i>And who has books?</i>

1058
01:20:43,416 --> 01:20:45,372
<i>Well, your bookies have books.</i>

1059
01:20:47,136 --> 01:20:48,250
He's clean.

1060
01:20:48,336 --> 01:20:50,291
SLEVIN: <i>Crooked bookies...</i>

1061
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:54,053
- <i>... who work with big-time crooks.</i>
- So... why are you here?

1062
01:21:05,254 --> 01:21:06,927
<i>I was looking for a gambler.</i>

1063
01:21:08,494 --> 01:21:10,166
<i>One who was in both books...</i>

1064
01:21:10,894 --> 01:21:13,169
<i>... with a lot of red in the minus column.</i>

1065
01:21:13,253 --> 01:21:14,369
Got him.

1066
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:16,410
<i>And that's when I found Nick Fisher.</i>

1067
01:21:17,013 --> 01:21:19,049
<i>A lowlife that no-one was gonna miss.</i>

1068
01:21:20,693 --> 01:21:22,012
1729.

1069
01:21:22,093 --> 01:21:24,243
Nick Fisher.

1070
01:21:24,332 --> 01:21:26,289
OK.

1071
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:39,487
GOODKAT: <i>There was a time.</i>

1072
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:58,043
All that was left to do was make the phone ring.

1073
01:22:17,768 --> 01:22:21,363
<i>All I had to do was pull the trigger</i>
<i>and wait for you to call the man</i>

1074
01:22:21,448 --> 01:22:23,678
<i>who does the jobs that no-one else wants.</i>

1075
01:22:25,728 --> 01:22:27,684
THE BOSS: <i>I want an outsider brought in.</i>

1076
01:22:29,088 --> 01:22:31,203
There's a specialist.

1077
01:22:33,326 --> 01:22:35,317
Calls himself Mr. Good Kat.

1078
01:22:41,126 --> 01:22:43,082
Fine.

1079
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:46,876
Tell him he can expect me in the morning.

1080
01:22:51,365 --> 01:22:53,322
Are you ready?

1081
01:22:53,405 --> 01:22:55,361
Yeah.

1082
01:22:58,325 --> 01:23:00,280
It's just that one last thing.

1083
01:23:08,884 --> 01:23:10,237
THE BOSS: <i>Mr. Good Kat.</i>

1084
01:23:11,204 --> 01:23:12,842
It's been a long time.

1085
01:23:17,003 --> 01:23:21,474
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr. Good Kat.
So I'll get right down to business.

1086
01:23:22,563 --> 01:23:26,271
Slim Hopkins, the man who ran my book,
was hit yesterday.

1087
01:23:27,923 --> 01:23:30,072
And I guess you've already heard about...

1088
01:23:31,522 --> 01:23:34,036
- <i>... my son.</i>
- Yes, I heard.

1089
01:23:35,001 --> 01:23:36,754
I need you to sort it out for me.

1090
01:23:36,842 --> 01:23:38,480
Who's the mark?

1091
01:23:38,561 --> 01:23:40,075
Yitzchok.

1092
01:23:43,321 --> 01:23:44,880
Yitzchok, The Rabbi's son?

1093
01:23:44,961 --> 01:23:47,077
<i>You remember The Rabbi?</i>

1094
01:23:47,161 --> 01:23:48,912
I remember The Rabbi well.

1095
01:23:49,001 --> 01:23:50,559
<i>Thing is...</i>

1096
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,075
it can't look like a job.

1097
01:23:53,961 --> 01:23:56,394
<i>If Yitzchok gets hit, The Rabbi will go to war.</i>

1098
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,112
So... I need you to make it look like
it ain't what it is.

1099
01:24:04,599 --> 01:24:06,715
<i>Can that be done?</i>

1100
01:24:06,799 --> 01:24:08,710
Anything can be done.

1101
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,154
Good. How?

1102
01:24:13,238 --> 01:24:15,309
Kansas City Shuffle.

1103
01:24:17,038 --> 01:24:18,915
I'm not familiar with the term.

1104
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,668
I'll need to see Slim's books.

1105
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:29,115
Slim's books were taken when he was hit,
but... I do keep copies.

1106
01:24:33,677 --> 01:24:35,793
What are you looking for?

1107
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:41,677
This is our guy. Nick - 1729.

1108
01:24:42,316 --> 01:24:44,352
1729.

1109
01:24:44,436 --> 01:24:45,789
Nick Fisher.

1110
01:24:45,876 --> 01:24:46,945
Why him?

1111
01:24:48,036 --> 01:24:49,628
A loser.

1112
01:24:49,715 --> 01:24:51,911
Pick him up. Bring him here.

1113
01:25:00,115 --> 01:25:02,390
GOODKAT: <i>Still not talking to each other, huh?</i>

1114
01:25:02,474 --> 01:25:04,431
<i>Can't say that I blame you.</i>

1115
01:25:04,514 --> 01:25:06,584
- Why are you here?
- Big job.

1116
01:25:06,674 --> 01:25:09,632
I was under the impression
you no longer worked New York.

1117
01:25:09,714 --> 01:25:12,751
Like I said... very big job.

1118
01:25:12,834 --> 01:25:16,873
And you thought, as long as you're in town,
you'd drop by and see your old pal Schlomo,

1119
01:25:16,953 --> 01:25:19,626
and say, "Hello. How about them Yanks?"

1120
01:25:21,913 --> 01:25:23,869
No. But something like that.

1121
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:30,706
Only problem is you and I aren't old friends.

1122
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:32,225
And I hate baseball.

1123
01:25:32,312 --> 01:25:35,463
And since we're not friends and
you hate baseball, why the fuck are you here?

1124
01:25:35,552 --> 01:25:38,305
It's because we're not friends that I'm here.

1125
01:25:39,191 --> 01:25:42,787
Because if we had been friends,
I wouldn't have been hired to kill your son.

1126
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:47,422
Because that is right at the top of my list
of things that friends do not do to their friends.

1127
01:25:47,511 --> 01:25:50,628
The good news for you is,
my friendship is for sale.

1128
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:54,621
You see, it seems to me
that your son means more to you alive

1129
01:25:54,711 --> 01:25:56,621
than he does to The Boss dead.

1130
01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:58,860
And more money means more to me
than less money.

1131
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:02,908
And you are the guy that sleeps with
all that green under your mattress.

1132
01:26:03,709 --> 01:26:05,223
I'm listening.

1133
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:09,222
You will pay me double to kill The Boss
what The Boss was paying me to kill Yitzchok.

1134
01:26:09,309 --> 01:26:12,381
- Ohh.
- And that...

1135
01:26:14,109 --> 01:26:16,064
And that will make us friends.

1136
01:26:16,829 --> 01:26:18,784
Right, Rabbi?

1137
01:26:19,829 --> 01:26:21,147
Hm?

1138
01:26:25,108 --> 01:26:29,659
And... since friends do favors for their friends,
you will do a favor for me.

1139
01:26:29,747 --> 01:26:32,546
Pray tell? What is this favor?

1140
01:26:32,627 --> 01:26:36,017
Concerns a matter of debt collection.
One debt in particular.

1141
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:37,222
Whose?

1142
01:26:37,307 --> 01:26:40,298
A flop. From Benny's book.
Goes by the name of Nick Fisher.

1143
01:26:40,387 --> 01:26:42,456
Who is he?

1144
01:26:42,546 --> 01:26:44,502
Just a loser.

1145
01:26:44,586 --> 01:26:46,542
You just made a lot of money.

1146
01:26:49,866 --> 01:26:52,938
SLEVIN: <i>And then I was free</i>
<i>to come and go as I pleased.</i>

1147
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:07,101
Hm?

1148
01:27:07,184 --> 01:27:10,142
Whatever they're paying you...

1149
01:27:16,704 --> 01:27:18,057
Oh.

1150
01:27:18,943 --> 01:27:20,137
There is nobody.

1151
01:27:22,383 --> 01:27:24,339
I did this to you.

1152
01:27:27,222 --> 01:27:28,371
- Me.
- You.

1153
01:27:29,102 --> 01:27:30,821
Me.

1154
01:27:36,702 --> 01:27:38,658
Who are you?

1155
01:27:41,221 --> 01:27:43,133
BRIKOWSKl: <i>Who is he?</i>

1156
01:27:43,221 --> 01:27:47,373
Considering he no longer has fingerprints,
I'd say it's unlikely we'll ever know.

1157
01:27:47,461 --> 01:27:49,213
What about dental records?

1158
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:54,659
Sure, find the bottom half of the jaw, then all
we need to do is find out who the dentist was.

1159
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:57,416
What a fucking mess.

1160
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:01,015
<i>Hey, Brikowski, it's Marty, you there?</i>

1161
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:05,012
<i>We found two more bodies</i>
<i>to go along with the two you've already got.</i>

1162
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,055
All right, I'll be right over.

1163
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:11,291
Did you ever get a hold of The Rabbi so he can
get down here and identify what's left of his kid?

1164
01:28:11,379 --> 01:28:14,610
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>We've been calling for the last hour, no answer.</i>

1165
01:28:14,699 --> 01:28:16,132
Send somebody over.

1166
01:28:16,219 --> 01:28:17,368
<i>Copy.</i>

1167
01:28:19,298 --> 01:28:22,017
You all right? You look a little shook-up.

1168
01:28:22,098 --> 01:28:23,895
No, I'm fine.

1169
01:28:23,978 --> 01:28:25,934
All right.

1170
01:28:48,416 --> 01:28:51,487
- Yeah.
- <i>Hey, Brikowski, it's Murphy.</i>

1171
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,089
Hey, Murph, what's up?

1172
01:28:53,175 --> 01:28:56,168
<i>Harry Kello came by today.</i>
<i>You remember Harry?</i>

1173
01:28:56,256 --> 01:28:59,964
He retired a few years ago. His wife just died,
so he comes in a couple of times a week,

1174
01:29:00,055 --> 01:29:02,011
talks shop, tells stories to the rooks.

1175
01:29:02,094 --> 01:29:05,644
Starts every sentence with, "The way
things used to be". Guy living in the past.

1176
01:29:05,735 --> 01:29:08,203
- Yeah. Yeah, what about him?
- <i>We're making small talk.</i>

1177
01:29:08,295 --> 01:29:11,764
Guy says he can't complain,
then all he does is fuckin' complain.

1178
01:29:11,854 --> 01:29:15,130
His dead wife, the leg he got shot in,
his crappy pension,

1179
01:29:15,214 --> 01:29:18,763
but then he stops when he sees the picture
Marty snapped of your kid.

1180
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:22,528
Just stares at it.
I say, "What is it? You know the kid?"

1181
01:29:22,613 --> 01:29:25,252
Thing is, he ain't looking at the picture,
but at the name.

1182
01:29:25,333 --> 01:29:28,609
I've got it written at the bottom.
He knows that name: Slevin.

1183
01:29:47,851 --> 01:29:49,807
I have that same phone.

1184
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:05,967
<i>About an hour later the phone rings, it's Harry,</i>
<i>talking like a goddamned machine gun,</i>

1185
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:08,438
going on and on about a horse race back in '79.

1186
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:13,165
<i>Aqueduct.</i>

1187
01:30:14,169 --> 01:30:16,318
Seven horse, tenth race - ring a bell?

1188
01:30:17,409 --> 01:30:19,364
<i>(Race start bell)</i>

1189
01:30:23,768 --> 01:30:25,724
<i>It was a drug store handicap.</i>

1190
01:30:25,808 --> 01:30:29,686
<i>Big wind-up, around the time The Boss,</i>
<i>The Rabbi set up shop in New York,</i>

1191
01:30:29,768 --> 01:30:32,680
<i>before people started</i>
<i>waking up with knives in their backs.</i>

1192
01:30:32,768 --> 01:30:37,283
Anyway, he goes on about this local legend,
about this kid.

1193
01:30:37,367 --> 01:30:39,085
His name was Max.

1194
01:30:41,847 --> 01:30:45,475
<i>Max placed a bet with a bookie named Roth.</i>

1195
01:30:45,566 --> 01:30:47,716
Roth laid the bet off.

1196
01:30:47,807 --> 01:30:49,319
On you.

1197
01:30:58,405 --> 01:31:00,157
And you.

1198
01:31:06,765 --> 01:31:09,438
But when The Rabbi and The Boss
find out the fix is in,

1199
01:31:09,524 --> 01:31:11,480
they are the opposite of happy.

1200
01:31:11,564 --> 01:31:14,476
Word comes down an example is to be made.

1201
01:31:14,564 --> 01:31:15,314
Aargh!

1202
01:31:15,404 --> 01:31:17,634
These guys kill everyone!

1203
01:31:17,724 --> 01:31:18,918
<i>And I mean every one.</i>

1204
01:31:19,963 --> 01:31:23,115
<i>Max, his wife, his kid, Roth...</i>

1205
01:31:23,203 --> 01:31:25,034
<i>even the goddamned horse died.</i>

1206
01:31:25,123 --> 01:31:28,593
These guys went to town with a tomahawk.
It was a fucking massacre.

1207
01:31:30,242 --> 01:31:34,282
<i>They had to bring in a specialist to do the kid</i>
<i>cos nobody would take the job.</i>

1208
01:31:51,481 --> 01:31:53,675
What have you done with my son?

1209
01:32:09,319 --> 01:32:10,991
You?

1210
01:32:11,079 --> 01:32:13,070
No.

1211
01:32:13,159 --> 01:32:15,353
You're dead.

1212
01:32:16,839 --> 01:32:19,147
You're dead!

1213
01:32:25,118 --> 01:32:29,157
<i>So Harry's going on about how they had to</i>
<i>bring in a specialist to kill the kid,</i>

1214
01:32:29,238 --> 01:32:33,276
but I ain't seeing the connection,
so I says, "What has this to do with the case?"

1215
01:32:33,358 --> 01:32:35,313
<i>He says, "The horse's name."</i>

1216
01:32:35,397 --> 01:32:37,433
<i>I say, "What about the horse's name?"</i>

1217
01:32:37,517 --> 01:32:41,749
<i>He says the horse's name was</i>
<i>Lucky Number Slevin.</i>

1218
01:32:41,836 --> 01:32:43,748
- What is your name?
- Slevin Kelevra.

1219
01:32:52,596 --> 01:32:54,551
Do you remember this part?

1220
01:33:04,874 --> 01:33:07,753
Please! I have a family.

1221
01:33:07,835 --> 01:33:09,666
Not any more, you don't.

1222
01:33:09,754 --> 01:33:11,473
Henry! (Sobs)

1223
01:33:13,474 --> 01:33:15,430
You fucking bastards!

1224
01:33:17,073 --> 01:33:19,588
You fucking bastards!

1225
01:33:38,152 --> 01:33:40,620
The two of you killed everything I ever loved.

1226
01:33:46,631 --> 01:33:48,588
Fuck you both.

1227
01:34:12,029 --> 01:34:16,819
<i>Now, there is no such person as Slevin Kelevra,</i>
<i>as far as I can tell.</i>

1228
01:34:16,909 --> 01:34:19,059
<i>Which means the kid was using a pseudonym.</i>

1229
01:34:19,148 --> 01:34:22,061
<i>Which is interesting,</i>
<i>him picking the name of a dead racehorse</i>

1230
01:34:22,148 --> 01:34:24,378
and keeping company
with The Boss and The Rabbi,

1231
01:34:24,468 --> 01:34:27,585
seeing as they had some involvement
with that very horse.

1232
01:34:27,668 --> 01:34:30,228
<i>I thought to myself, maybe it means something.</i>

1233
01:34:30,308 --> 01:34:34,983
<i>Then again, maybe its just a coincidence,</i>
<i>name's gotta come from someplace - right?</i>

1234
01:34:35,067 --> 01:34:38,616
<i>I guess none of this really matters</i>
<i>now that the kid's gone cold.</i>

1235
01:34:43,426 --> 01:34:46,464
<i>Ah, one more thing,</i>
<i>we've got a new guy in the precinct.</i>

1236
01:34:47,187 --> 01:34:49,620
<i>Jewish fella, funny little guy, talks a lot.</i>

1237
01:34:51,066 --> 01:34:55,821
<i>Anyway, in case you're interested,</i>
<i>he says the name Kelevra is Hebrew.</i>

1238
01:34:55,905 --> 01:34:58,021
<i>He says it means...</i>

1239
01:34:58,105 --> 01:35:00,061
Bad dog.

1240
01:35:06,345 --> 01:35:08,904
BRIKOWSKl:
<i>20 years ago, he used to be my bookie.</i>

1241
01:35:08,985 --> 01:35:11,054
<i>I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.</i>

1242
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:28,539
Brikowski? You there?

1243
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:20,091
<i>Your girl made me.</i>

1244
01:37:21,814 --> 01:37:23,769
She took my picture.

1245
01:37:24,694 --> 01:37:26,649
She's got to go in the ground.

1246
01:37:28,893 --> 01:37:29,848
OK.

1247
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:52,487
I have something I have to tell you.

1248
01:37:55,051 --> 01:37:57,007
He told me that we needed to kill you.

1249
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:04,126
You're gonna have to trust me.

1250
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:17,085
Shit!

1251
01:38:19,888 --> 01:38:21,845
He's going to shoot you here.

1252
01:39:17,004 --> 01:39:18,960
I didn't think you'd understand.

1253
01:39:35,883 --> 01:39:37,440
I understood.

1254
01:39:42,082 --> 01:39:44,037
How did you find out about us?

1255
01:39:44,122 --> 01:39:46,272
I'm a world-class assassin, fuckhead.

1256
01:39:46,361 --> 01:39:48,318
How do you think I found out?

1257
01:39:51,841 --> 01:39:53,672
I thought you might want this.

1258
01:40:31,878 --> 01:40:33,629
I want to go home.

1259
01:40:33,718 --> 01:40:35,993
Neither of us is going home for a long time, kid.

1260
01:40:39,677 --> 01:40:41,634
My name is Good Kat.

1261
01:40:42,677 --> 01:40:44,632
You can call me Mr. Good Kat.
