1
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,353
This is a diary...

2
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:15,861
of...

3
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:19,156
hate.

4
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:26,468
And perhaps I wouldn't
be writing it...

5
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,637
if some devil hadn't made me
stop him that night...

6
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:33,236
in the rain.

7
00:02:33,313 --> 00:02:35,406
You want to drown, Henry?

8
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:40,980
I wanted a bit of air.

9
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:43,990
How nice to see you, Bendrix.

10
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:46,491
How long has it been?
Ayear?

11
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:49,653
June, 1 944.

12
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,393
As long as that?

13
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,866
How's Sarah?

14
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:57,336
Oh, she's out and about
somewhere.

15
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:59,338
She at the cinema?

16
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,668
No, she never goes.

17
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:06,341
Oh, good night, Henry.

18
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:10,177
You should go home
before you catch your death.

19
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:15,588
Is something wrong?

20
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:21,828
Let me take you home, Henry.

21
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:27,459
Or perhaps I wouldn't
be writing this...

22
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:30,503
if I had known then
who I hated.

23
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,664
Was it Henry?
Was it his wife Sarah?

24
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:39,036
Or was it some other
who was yet to be revealed to me?

25
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:43,816
Sarah?

26
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:51,716
See? She's out still.

27
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,234
Come upstairs.

28
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:27,326
Come in.
Let me get you a drink.

29
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:29,988
Whiskey, thank you.

30
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:31,497
Whiskey.

31
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:43,367
So what's troubling you,
Henry?

32
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:47,345
Sarah.

33
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:01,120
She's out for a walk now,
Bendrix.

34
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:07,624
A walk.

35
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:10,466
Well, she always was
a great walker.

36
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,480
Jealousy's a terrible thing.

37
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:31,153
Well, you know you
can trust me, Henry.

38
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:37,093
You know, I went so far...

39
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:40,100
as to get the name
of a private detective.

40
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:45,670
You think she's seeing someone?

41
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,867
- Of course you think me a fool.
- No, Henry.

42
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:51,338
I don't think you're a fool.

43
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:55,014
- You mean you think it's possible?
- Of course.

44
00:05:55,082 --> 00:05:57,209
Sarah's human.

45
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:01,821
Can't sleep.

46
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:06,617
Keep picking up...

47
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:10,425
this wretched card.

48
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:13,959
Burn it.

49
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:17,334
- I wish I could.
- Then go see what's-his-name, Savage?

50
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:20,202
And sit where all
the jealous husbands sit?

51
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,442
Do you think they have
a waiting room, Bendrix...

52
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:27,207
where we see each other's faces
as we pass through?

53
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:29,180
Why not let me go, Henry?

54
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:32,408
- You?
- Yes.

55
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:35,752
I could pretend
to be a jealous lover.

56
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:39,156
Jealous lovers are less ridiculous
than jealous husbands.

57
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:41,718
They're supported
by the weight of literature.

58
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:45,060
Tragic, never comic.
Think ofTroilus.

59
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:49,536
Well, I shan't lose my amour propre
when I interview Mr. Savage.

60
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:51,997
This is ridiculous.

61
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:54,007
One can't spy on one's wife
through a friend...

62
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:56,009
and have the friend
pretend to be her lover.

63
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:59,409
- What else are friends for?
- You're a good chap, Bendrix.

64
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,641
All I needed was to talk,
clear my head.

65
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:04,776
The name was Savage,
and the address was 3 Vigo Passage.

66
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:07,786
Forget what I've told you.
Doesn't make sense. I'll see a doctor.

67
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,425
That was the door.
Sarah's come in.

68
00:07:13,593 --> 00:07:16,461
It's the maid.
She's been to the pictures.

69
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:18,761
No, it was Sarah's step.

70
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:24,430
Sarah, darling.

71
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:26,870
Henry.

72
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:30,639
- You-- Is that you?
- Been out for a walk?

73
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:33,271
- Yes.
- It's a filthy night.

74
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:36,612
You're wet through, Sarah.
One day you'll catch your death of cold.

75
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:40,086
Good night.

76
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,720
Their marriage was conventional...

77
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:49,990
like their well-appointed house.

78
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:53,226
And I liked them both
the first night we met...

79
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,396
drinking bad South African sherry
because of the war in Spain.

80
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,129
Good evening, sir.

81
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,141
- May I take your hat?
- Thank you.

82
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:04,144
Mr. Miles is upstairs.

83
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,815
Sherry, sir?

84
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:14,411
Thank you.

85
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:16,422
She seemed restless.

86
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:20,552
ln the summer of 1 939...

87
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:24,495
the whole of London was restless
in the face of the coming storm.

88
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:39,671
How nice of you to come.

89
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:44,845
Sarah, this is our neighbor,
the novelist chap.

90
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:46,943
What on earth
is a novelist doing here?

91
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,181
- Research.
- On what?

92
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:49,620
On your husband.

93
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,352
I'm trying to write a character
who works for the Ministry of Pensions.

94
00:08:53,427 --> 00:08:56,157
I need to find out his habits,
what he drinks before bedtime.

95
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,822
- Cocoa.
- And when.

96
00:08:57,898 --> 00:09:00,162
11:00, isn't it, Sarah?
Unless we're entertaining.

97
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:04,099
Would you be so kind
as to excuse your character?

98
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:06,696
- The ministry needs him.
- Unfortunately it does.

99
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:10,167
- So tell me.
- What?

100
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:12,610
- His secrets.
- Henry's a good man.

101
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,046
- Good men have no secrets.
- I was afraid you'd say that.

102
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:18,051
You see, goodness
has so little fictional value.

103
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,813
What does have fictional value?

104
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:23,379
- A minister of Home Security.
- Are you saying my husband is fiction?

105
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:26,254
I'm saying he could be,
in the right hands.

106
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:28,692
Oh, dear. This is alarming.
Can we get away from the service?

107
00:09:28,763 --> 00:09:32,528
- You mean change the subject?
- I meant fresh air actually.

108
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,692
Of course.

109
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:38,595
- So how long have you been married?
- Is your character married?

110
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:41,403
Yes, he's been married happily
for ten years.

111
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:44,409
Henry's the perfect model then.
We've been married ten years.

112
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:45,604
You know that...

113
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,547
happiness is even harder to write
than goodness.

114
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:51,676
Henry prefers habit to happiness.

115
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:58,548
- I'll give them to you to sign.
- We were discussing the house, darling.

116
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:02,351
Let me fill that for you.

117
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:04,864
- It's a lovely house.
- My wife found it.

118
00:10:04,932 --> 00:10:06,865
And your wife is charming.

119
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:09,265
- She's a great help to me.
- Yes, I'm sure.

120
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:11,931
They've made a picture
of one of your books, haven't they?

121
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:15,168
Yes, it's playing at the Rialto.

122
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:18,438
- I'll take you both.
- Far too busy for pictures, I'm afraid.

123
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:20,104
Should I make a note of that?

124
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:22,341
Make sure your character
never gets home before 10:00.

125
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,145
- Come out, Henry, for once?
- You know I can't, darling.

126
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:28,017
But you go.
Take her, Bendrix.

127
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:30,818
- Sarah, one has to insist.
- Henry.

128
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,688
- Where are you going?
- To see wonder.

129
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,025
- But you promised.
- Murderer's promises keep.

130
00:10:41,568 --> 00:10:45,129
- It's not what I wrote, you know.
- You can't keep saying that.

131
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:47,799
- It's true.
- I know.

132
00:10:58,385 --> 00:11:00,785
There was one scene you did write.

133
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:02,345
Describe it.

134
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,913
Where he offered her onions
with her meal.

135
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:07,984
She refused because her husband
didn't like the smell.

136
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:09,825
He got angry.

137
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,366
And why did he get angry?

138
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:19,500
He didn't want to think of her
going home to him.

139
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:28,471
Does Henry like onions?

140
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:30,916
No.

141
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,210
I'm in love, you know.

142
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:01,379
Me too.

143
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:10,054
Susan?

144
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:13,109
Come upstairs.

145
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:01,360
Sarah?

146
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:11,003
One minute, dear.

147
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:16,235
What if he heard?

148
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:18,539
He wouldn't recognize the sound.

149
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:35,893
- Sarah, you been eating onions?
- Sorry, darling.

150
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:39,197
So, Bendrix,
how was the picture?

151
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:41,200
Up to scratch?

152
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:47,234
Of course, as she began to love me...

153
00:15:47,307 --> 00:15:50,173
she learned to deceive Henry.

154
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:54,442
So why was I upset to find
that two years later...

155
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:57,278
she was deceiving him again?

156
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,663
Mr. Bendrix, I assume we
are discussing Mrs. Bendrix.

157
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:15,462
Not exactly. She's the wife
of a friend of mine.

158
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:18,471
Perhaps you and the lady
are intimate?

159
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:19,971
No.

160
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:23,270
I've only seen her once
since 1 944.

161
00:16:23,342 --> 00:16:25,368
I don't understand.

162
00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:27,640
You said this was a watching case.

163
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:34,749
Can't one love or hate
as long as that?

164
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:38,625
There's nothing discreditable
about jealousy, Mr. Bendrix.

165
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,220
I always salute it
as the mark of true love.

166
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:46,027
I've come on behalf of the husband.
He thinks she's deceiving him.

167
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,797
- She has secrets.
- Ah, secrets.

168
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,168
- Yes.
- There may be nothing in it, of course.

169
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,730
ln my experience, Mr. Bendrix...

170
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:58,106
there almost invariably is.

171
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:01,379
Shall my man report to you
or the husband?

172
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:02,539
To me.

173
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:04,846
He must know nothing about it.

174
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:09,521
Most interesting case.

175
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:14,683
All my men use great discretion.
I will put one on it immediately.

176
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:18,892
And he will do his damndest
to put your mind at rest.

177
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,801
Or should I say the husband's?

178
00:17:43,156 --> 00:17:45,057
Hello?

179
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:49,891
Good.
Yes, it was good to see you.

180
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:53,833
Yes, how long has it been?
Two years.

181
00:17:53,901 --> 00:17:55,835
As long as that?

182
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:58,565
Well, you were always better
at anniversaries than me.

183
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:02,740
You want to meet?
Well, whatever for?

184
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,570
Not tomorrow, no.
I've got this article.

185
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:11,413
Wednesday? Let me check.

186
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,624
Would Thursday do?

187
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:22,417
Good.
The Park Lane Hotel at 1:00?

188
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:41,175
lt was odd to think
that during the war...

189
00:18:41,248 --> 00:18:44,217
we could be so totally at peace.

190
00:18:44,284 --> 00:18:46,980
There were nights
when I wished those sirens...

191
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:48,988
would never end.

192
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:20,018
Tell me again.

193
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:22,112
I love you.

194
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:27,117
And I always will.

195
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:47,771
I'm sorry I'm late.
I came by tube, but it was crowded.

196
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:49,781
Well, taxi is quicker.

197
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:52,340
I know.
Didn't want to be quick.

198
00:19:54,621 --> 00:19:56,555
I booked a table at Palmer's.

199
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:03,859
Can't we stay here?

200
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:07,162
Well, it's where
we always used to go.

201
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:09,531
You see,
I've never been back there.

202
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:12,696
Well, it was never
your restaurant, was it?

203
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:15,708
- So you still go there?
- Yeah, two or three times a week.

204
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:17,710
It's convenient.

205
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,444
Let's go.

206
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:27,219
Thank you. Thanks.

207
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:30,722
- Sorry about that.
- That's quite all right, sir.

208
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,587
Got my hand caught in the way.

209
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:55,371
Such a pleasure to see you, sir.

210
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:58,111
It'sbeen so long,
I thought you'd forgotten us.

211
00:20:58,184 --> 00:21:01,018
- I was afraid you'd say that.
- And you, ma'am.

212
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:04,250
- It'sbeen a long time too.
- Two years, Alfred.

213
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:11,561
- There.
- Thank you.

214
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:25,310
Why did you lie?

215
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:28,246
- About my coming here?
- Yes.

216
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:30,782
Why did you want to meet?

217
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,921
I wanted to ask you about Henry.

218
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:37,422
Henry.

219
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:41,086
I'm worried about him.

220
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:43,459
How did you find him
the other night?

221
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:46,464
- Was he strange at all?
- I didn't notice anything wrong.

222
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:51,733
I wanted to ask you--
I know you're very busy--

223
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:54,103
whether you could
look him up occasionally.

224
00:21:54,173 --> 00:21:56,232
I think he's lonely.

225
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:58,299
With you?

226
00:21:58,377 --> 00:22:00,607
You know he's
never really noticed me...

227
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,614
not for years.

228
00:22:03,983 --> 00:22:06,645
Maybe you've given him reason.

229
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:09,980
What reason could I give?

230
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,321
What reason did you give me?

231
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:21,700
None.

232
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:26,972
- Are you on a new book?
- Of course.

233
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,974
It's not about us, is it?
The one you threatened to write.

234
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:33,843
A book takes a year to write.
It's too hard work for revenge.

235
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:36,177
lf you knew how little
you had to revenge.

236
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:39,912
I'm joking.
Yeah, we had a good time together.

237
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:43,250
We're adults, and we knew
it had to end sometime.

238
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:46,849
And now we can lunch
and talk about Henry.

239
00:22:56,635 --> 00:22:57,728
I'm sorry.

240
00:22:57,804 --> 00:23:01,365
This was stupid,
and I really shouldn't have called.

241
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:03,671
That cough needs attending to.

242
00:23:03,742 --> 00:23:06,303
It's only a cough.

243
00:23:06,378 --> 00:23:08,006
Good-bye, Maurice.

244
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,513
Good-bye.

245
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,047
- Your menu, sir.
- Thank you.

246
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:27,196
I'm sorry, but you have to realize
I'm jealous of everything that moves.

247
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:30,895
- I'm jealous of the rain.
- How can you be jealous of the rain?

248
00:23:49,522 --> 00:23:51,990
Where did you get it?

249
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:53,684
Spain.

250
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,193
That was my war, I'm afraid.

251
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:58,355
lt finished me off for this one.

252
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:01,400
You were shot. How romantic.

253
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:05,063
Not really.
They put a pin inside me.

254
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:08,835
I wondered about the limp.
Could I grow to love it?

255
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:11,069
And have you?

256
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:14,943
I have never, ever loved anyone
as much as you.

257
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:37,727
Yes?

258
00:24:38,872 --> 00:24:41,635
A Mr. Parkis to see you, sir.

259
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,471
Show him in.

260
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,477
This way, please.

261
00:24:49,982 --> 00:24:53,316
- I'll be with you in a minute, Mr.--
- The name's Parkis.

262
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:57,115
Mr. Savage's man.

263
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,182
Sit down.
Take a cigarette.

264
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:02,454
Oh, no, sir.
Not on duty, sir.

265
00:25:02,528 --> 00:25:04,587
Unless, of course,
for purposes of concealment.

266
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:06,597
But you're not on duty now.

267
00:25:06,665 --> 00:25:08,998
Well, in a manner of speaking,
yes, sir.

268
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:12,334
I've just been relieved for half an hour
while I make my report.

269
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,832
So there's something to report?

270
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,934
It's not quite a blank sheet, sir.

271
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:23,815
Have me met
somewhere before, sir?

272
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:27,542
I don't think so.

273
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:35,087
Well, like I say, sir...

274
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:37,322
it's not quite a blank sheet.

275
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:39,330
But then it never is.

276
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:44,768
Me and my boy,
we followed the--

277
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,828
Your boy?

278
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:49,567
My son, sir.

279
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:53,009
Yeah, I'm teaching him
the business.

280
00:25:53,078 --> 00:25:56,207
I mean, a boy can be useful
in all sorts of ways.

281
00:25:57,317 --> 00:26:01,184
On the day in question, the party in
question went by tube to Piccadilly...

282
00:26:02,454 --> 00:26:04,820
and proceeded
to the Park Lane Hotel.

283
00:26:04,891 --> 00:26:07,382
She seemed quite agitated.

284
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:11,593
And there met a gentleman with whom
she was obviously quite close...

285
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:15,863
since they greeted each other
with an affectionate lack of ceremony...

286
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:17,527
and at one point--

287
00:26:17,604 --> 00:26:21,164
although I cannot be certain of this--
held hands along the bar.

288
00:26:22,474 --> 00:26:25,307
- They held hands?
- Yes, sir.

289
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:27,778
Gentleman pushed the lady's glass
towards her...

290
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:28,939
and...

291
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:31,608
the hand sort of stayed there...

292
00:26:31,684 --> 00:26:33,277
for some time.

293
00:26:33,353 --> 00:26:35,583
Which generally indicates
a squeeze of that nature.

294
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,085
After a short conversation,
they proceeded to a restaurant...

295
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:42,752
called...

296
00:26:42,828 --> 00:26:44,353
Palmer's...

297
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:47,558
which was difficult to gain access to,
me being with the boy and all.

298
00:26:47,634 --> 00:26:49,567
But I observed them
through the window.

299
00:26:50,537 --> 00:26:53,596
And after a while,
the lady left...

300
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:56,232
laboring--
well, it seemed to me--

301
00:26:56,308 --> 00:26:58,435
under great emotion.

302
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,412
Great emotion.
You're sure of that?

303
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,414
Oh, without doubt, sir.

304
00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:06,576
Then I followed her down
Charing Cross Road to Maiden Lane...

305
00:27:06,653 --> 00:27:10,952
where she turned into a church for what
I can only presume was a good cry.

306
00:27:12,826 --> 00:27:14,794
She's not a Roman, is she, sir?

307
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:16,294
No.

308
00:27:16,363 --> 00:27:17,886
Thought not.

309
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:20,728
She didn't kneel, sir,
but sat.

310
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,359
From the angle of her face,
I could tell...

311
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,869
tears were an issue.

312
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:28,874
- Forgive the personal touch.
- Of course.

313
00:27:30,676 --> 00:27:34,271
You see, I liked the lady.
The party in question.

314
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:37,441
As did l, but you were wrong
about the hands.

315
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:39,815
The hands, sir?

316
00:27:39,885 --> 00:27:42,650
We never so much as touched hands.

317
00:27:44,758 --> 00:27:45,849
Oh, dear.

318
00:27:45,924 --> 00:27:49,554
- I have made a fool of myself.
- Sarah has that effect.

319
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:52,894
Mr. Savage
should have introduced us.

320
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:55,230
Oh, no, sir.

321
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,292
- lt was up to me.
- Well, it's not serious.

322
00:27:58,371 --> 00:28:01,897
lf you look at it from the outside,
it's quite funny.

323
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:04,170
But I'm on the inside, sir.

324
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:08,939
It's not Mr. Savage I'm worried about
so much. It'smy boy, sir.

325
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:14,375
- When I tell him you're the husband--
- But you're wrong.

326
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:16,786
I'm acting on the husband's behalf.

327
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:19,689
So you've requested
an investigation yourself?

328
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:22,192
That's an interesting paradox.

329
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:24,355
But who's the wronged party then,
sir, if you'll forgive?

330
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,393
Pardon me, sir.

331
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:33,494
I am slow in such matters.

332
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:37,065
Both you and the husband have been
supplanted in the lady's affections by--

333
00:28:37,143 --> 00:28:38,576
Another?

334
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,375
Try to think of it
the way I do, Mr. Parkis.

335
00:28:45,384 --> 00:28:48,319
Jealousy can only exist
with desire.

336
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:52,586
You are on a hunt for desire.

337
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:55,219
Just regard yourself
as its servant.

338
00:28:56,563 --> 00:28:59,224
Of course, sir.
That's my job.

339
00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:01,499
Thank you.

340
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:15,246
The vicarious lover, Parkis.

341
00:29:16,482 --> 00:29:18,815
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

342
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,460
I wondered how much of her
he could reclaim for me.

343
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:33,630
And, for a moment,
I wished I was him...

344
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,726
shining his searchlight
around her world.

345
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:46,207
I am a jealous man.

346
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:02,923
- I'm jealous of this stocking.
- Why?

347
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:05,191
'Cause it does what I can't.

348
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:08,232
lt kisses your whole leg.

349
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:14,798
And I'm jealous of this button.

350
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:18,332
- Poor, innocent button.
- It's not innocent at all.

351
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:23,113
It'swith you all day,
and I'm not.

352
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:31,788
- I suppose you're jealous of my shoes.
- Yes.

353
00:30:32,858 --> 00:30:34,451
Why?

354
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:37,953
Because they'll
take you away from me.

355
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:43,365
I measured love
by the extent of my jealousy.

356
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:45,199
And as my jealousy was infinite...

357
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,204
Anyone who loves is jealous.

358
00:30:47,272 --> 00:30:49,502
my love should have
been infinite too.

359
00:30:49,576 --> 00:30:53,807
I hate you being unhappy. I don't mind
anything you do that makes you happy.

360
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,177
- lf I slept with someone else?
- That's neither here nor there.

361
00:30:56,249 --> 00:30:58,182
I want you to be happy,
that's all.

362
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,184
Maybe you'd want an excuse
to do the same.

363
00:31:00,252 --> 00:31:02,413
- I never would.
- But you do.

364
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:05,480
- Do what?
- Sleep with someone else.

365
00:31:05,557 --> 00:31:08,527
You mean Henry?
How can anyone be jealous of Henry?

366
00:31:08,595 --> 00:31:11,290
He has you. I don't.

367
00:31:11,364 --> 00:31:13,298
We inhabit the same house.

368
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:17,165
That's all. You know that.
I'm the shadow he walks around.

369
00:31:17,236 --> 00:31:19,032
And I love you.

370
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:22,039
I would rather be dead or see you dead
than with another man.

371
00:31:22,107 --> 00:31:25,305
I will never, ever be
with another man.

372
00:31:25,377 --> 00:31:29,404
You may see me dead,
but I will never be with another man.

373
00:31:29,481 --> 00:31:31,882
- We should go down to the shelter.
- Stay here, Sarah.

374
00:31:31,951 --> 00:31:33,884
lf a bomb hit us now,
think of what wouldn't happen.

375
00:31:33,952 --> 00:31:37,183
- What wouldn't happen?
- You wouldn't go back to Henry.

376
00:31:37,256 --> 00:31:39,190
I would never imagine
another lover.

377
00:31:39,258 --> 00:31:42,557
- My jealousy would end.
- Would that make you happy?

378
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:16,421
Do you believe me now?

379
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:26,387
But sadly, I didn't believe her.

380
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:29,162
There was a devil in my mind
that would never let me.

381
00:33:30,236 --> 00:33:33,672
And now I had Parkis'boy
playing the devil's game.

382
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,731
My boy managed to gain access, sir.

383
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:20,670
Remarkably useful he can be.
I call that Exhibit ''A.''

384
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:25,648
They say a promise is forever,
but I don't know if I can keep this one.

385
00:35:25,717 --> 00:35:28,983
He killed me with jealousy.
You're killing me with love.

386
00:35:29,054 --> 00:35:32,320
So he's got the scent too,
Parkis.

387
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:34,757
- What scent?
- The scent of love.

388
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:37,853
Stalking it like a retriever.

389
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:41,023
Well, he's
remarkably persistent, sir.

390
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:44,934
He observed the party in question,
then in a state of partial undress...

391
00:35:45,003 --> 00:35:47,403
with an unidentified male.

392
00:35:47,472 --> 00:35:49,940
- Where?
- ln the bedroom, sir.

393
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:53,001
The male party then closed the door,
and my boy made his exit.

394
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,309
The implications, and I think
you would agree, is that...

395
00:35:56,382 --> 00:35:58,679
intimacy was...

396
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:01,177
imminent.

397
00:36:01,253 --> 00:36:03,414
lndeed. Who is he?

398
00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:05,820
Here, sir, is where progress
was definitely made.

399
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:09,925
As my boy left, he glanced at the
appointment book in the front hallway.

400
00:36:09,996 --> 00:36:14,432
The party in question had a dental
appointment at 3..30 the following day.

401
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,967
ln fact, she visited at 3:30...

402
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:21,199
a premises on 65 Cedar Road
where no dentist sign was in evidence.

403
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:42,987
A Mr. Smythe owns the premises, sir.

404
00:36:43,061 --> 00:36:45,894
Smythe, with a ''Y''?

405
00:36:45,965 --> 00:36:49,128
Yes, sir. S-M-Y-T-H-E.

406
00:36:50,235 --> 00:36:52,500
And...

407
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,003
no--

408
00:36:55,775 --> 00:36:59,643
Though we have no evidence
of intimacy...

409
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:01,771
the implication is clearly there.

410
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:03,780
How is it there?

411
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:05,907
Why the fictitious
dental appointment, sir?

412
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,481
Exhibit '' B.''

413
00:37:10,556 --> 00:37:12,489
My boy took that.

414
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:17,527
The party in question emerged
two hours later.

415
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:20,860
Passage of time being
amply sufficient for...

416
00:37:20,932 --> 00:37:22,594
intimacy to have taken place.

417
00:37:23,668 --> 00:37:26,159
The courts generally demand
at least an hour, sir.

418
00:37:27,306 --> 00:37:30,934
Now, my boy would have provided us
with photos of her reemergence...

419
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,945
but for the unfortunate
occurrence of him...

420
00:37:34,012 --> 00:37:35,445
falling asleep.

421
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,210
Luckily, sir,
the party in question...

422
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:45,757
mistook him
for an abandoned urchin...

423
00:37:45,824 --> 00:37:47,815
woke him up and led him
to the nearest tube station...

424
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:51,056
so that the time of reemergence
is definitely established...

425
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,860
as was an acquaintance which may have
its uses in the future, for all we know.

426
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:58,769
So should I walk in and confront him
like an injured husband?

427
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:02,432
I'm against it, sir.
lt complicates things in the courts.

428
00:38:02,507 --> 00:38:04,442
This will never reach court.

429
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,637
- An amicable settlement then.
- There's lack of interest.

430
00:38:07,713 --> 00:38:11,079
One can hardly make a fuss
about a man called Smythe.

431
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,050
I'd just like to see him,
that's all.

432
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,452
Well, perhaps Lance can oblige us
next time with a frontal.

433
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:19,456
- Lance?
- My boy.

434
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:22,318
Called after Lancelot,
the Round Table.

435
00:38:22,394 --> 00:38:24,862
He found the Holy Grail.

436
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:28,559
That was Galahad. Lancelot
was found in bed with Guinevere.

437
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:33,204
I hadn't heard.

438
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:49,985
I have to say, sir,
I would advise against it.

439
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:54,652
I'd just like to see
what a man called Smythe looks like.

440
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:57,719
Will you lend me your boy?

441
00:38:57,797 --> 00:39:01,630
Well, if you'll assure me
there'll be nothing unpleasant.

442
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:05,534
Sarah isn't there. This scene
will have a universal certificate.

443
00:39:05,603 --> 00:39:07,538
Come with me, young Lancelot.

444
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:11,103
Go on, Lance.

445
00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:13,474
No need to worry.

446
00:39:13,545 --> 00:39:15,740
Now, you're feeling ill,
remember?

447
00:39:15,815 --> 00:39:18,579
- How ill, sir?
- Ill enough to faint.

448
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,585
Can you act that?

449
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:22,951
If I hold my breath
and go all pale, sir.

450
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:24,454
Good.

451
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:37,364
Excuse me, but does
a Dr. Wilson live here?

452
00:39:37,436 --> 00:39:39,597
- No, I'm afraid he doesn't.
- Oh, dear.

453
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:42,800
See, I was given this address,
and my boy's quite ill.

454
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:45,105
We've traveled all this--
You all right?

455
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:47,610
- You better come in.
- Would you mind? I'm sorry.

456
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,012
I think he needs
to sit down badly.

457
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:51,514
Thank you.

458
00:39:55,855 --> 00:39:59,416
- Can I fetch him a glass of water?
- That's very kind.

459
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:01,686
Or some orange squash?

460
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,489
- Water will be fine.
- Orange squash, please.

461
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:06,793
Say thank you, Arthur.

462
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:10,302
- Is his name Arthur?
- Yes, Arthur James.

463
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,166
- His mother was fond of Tennyson.
- Is she--

464
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,934
Yes, yes. Four years now.

465
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,702
- He must be of great comfort to you.
- And anxiety.

466
00:40:20,778 --> 00:40:23,304
I ought to introduce myself.

467
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:25,577
- Bridges.
- My name is Smythe.

468
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,684
- With a ''Y''?
- Yes. This is my brother Richard.

469
00:40:26,684 --> 00:40:28,744
- With a ''Y''?
- Yes. This is my brother Richard.

470
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,413
This is Mr. Bridges.
His boy isn't feeling well.

471
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,085
I was given this address
for a Dr. Wilson.

472
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:36,958
There's no such doctor here.

473
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:43,260
I've seen your boy before.

474
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:45,393
Maybe on the common.

475
00:40:50,943 --> 00:40:54,378
What was the real purpose
of your visit?

476
00:40:56,916 --> 00:40:58,143
I told you. A doctor.

477
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:05,780
No, you're not ill,
are you, boy?

478
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:14,764
People sometimes come to me...

479
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:17,233
and can't explain why.

480
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:20,764
But if there is a reason--

481
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:22,773
- My brother often deals--
- Hush, Susan.

482
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:26,139
They must ask themselves.

483
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:33,317
I recognize your boy,
but you--

484
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:38,244
- Who recommended you?
- We have a friend in common.

485
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:40,891
Sarah Miles.

486
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:45,128
And your name is?

487
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:47,027
Bendrix.

488
00:41:53,806 --> 00:41:56,501
- I know all about you.
- I'm sure you do.

489
00:41:56,574 --> 00:41:58,804
But you must enlighten me.

490
00:41:58,876 --> 00:42:02,677
- Aren't you bound by vows of chastity?
- Oh, my dear!

491
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:05,349
Go, please.

492
00:42:06,418 --> 00:42:08,351
Would you just go?

493
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,514
Come along, Lancelot.

494
00:42:17,862 --> 00:42:20,990
Poor Sarah.
She had committed nothing but love.

495
00:42:21,065 --> 00:42:24,432
And here were Parkis and his boy
watching her every move.

496
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:26,527
I would have called the spies off...

497
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:29,300
had the devil not tugged
at my elbow once more.

498
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,536
Henry.

499
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,543
Still in the rain?

500
00:42:33,612 --> 00:42:36,637
Walking, Bendrix.
Doctor recommends it.

501
00:42:36,715 --> 00:42:38,739
Well, walk with me.

502
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:40,943
I recommend a drink.

503
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:56,099
How's Sarah?

504
00:42:57,268 --> 00:42:58,860
Pretty well.

505
00:42:58,936 --> 00:43:01,666
Did you ever consult
that private detective?

506
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:05,532
I'd hoped you had forgotten that.

507
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,943
I was overworked.

508
00:43:08,012 --> 00:43:10,106
I had Royal Commission brewing.

509
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:12,342
Don't worry, Henry.
I did it for you.

510
00:43:13,952 --> 00:43:16,750
- You had absolutely no right.
- I'm paying all the charges.

511
00:43:16,822 --> 00:43:18,346
It's infernal cheek.

512
00:43:18,423 --> 00:43:21,119
Here's the report, Henry.

513
00:43:21,193 --> 00:43:23,422
His name is Smythe, with a ''Y.''

514
00:43:23,494 --> 00:43:25,690
You've been properly led up
the garden path, Henry.

515
00:43:26,532 --> 00:43:29,126
- Will you let me pass?
- You don't want them?

516
00:43:29,201 --> 00:43:30,724
Photographs, names, love letters?

517
00:43:40,012 --> 00:43:42,242
Now will you let me go?

518
00:43:46,085 --> 00:43:48,610
I can always get you
a carbon copy.

519
00:44:05,704 --> 00:44:09,070
Strange how much dignity
there can be in a hat.

520
00:44:10,141 --> 00:44:13,577
Without it, he seemed
one of the anonymous...

521
00:44:13,644 --> 00:44:15,077
the dispossessed.

522
00:44:16,248 --> 00:44:20,081
I had pitied myself for so long,
it was odd...

523
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:23,018
to pity him.

524
00:44:23,088 --> 00:44:25,021
I'm sorry, Henry.

525
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,293
Sit down.

526
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:42,838
Were you two lovers, Bendrix?

527
00:44:47,545 --> 00:44:49,672
It's the only explanation.

528
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:52,849
The only excuse too.

529
00:44:57,222 --> 00:44:59,918
Can't you see
that what you've done...

530
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:02,119
is monstrous?

531
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:11,635
You must think me a fool
not to have guessed.

532
00:45:16,641 --> 00:45:19,474
Why didn't she leave me?

533
00:45:19,545 --> 00:45:21,911
Because you're a habit
she's formed.

534
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,914
You're her security.

535
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:27,679
- Why did she leave you?
- I became a bore.

536
00:45:27,753 --> 00:45:29,846
Like you.

537
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:31,889
But I wasn't born one.

538
00:45:31,956 --> 00:45:34,447
You created me.

539
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:37,653
She wouldn't leave you,
so I bored her with my jealousy.

540
00:45:38,931 --> 00:45:41,865
- You can't be jealous of me.
- Well, you won, in a way.

541
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:46,030
We had come to the end of love.

542
00:45:46,103 --> 00:45:49,039
She'd only make love with me,
but...

543
00:45:49,106 --> 00:45:52,235
she could shop and cook
and fall asleep with you.

544
00:45:54,413 --> 00:45:56,744
She's still very fond of you.

545
00:45:56,815 --> 00:45:59,943
One isn't satisfied with fondness.

546
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,382
- I was.
- Yes, and that made you her pimp.

547
00:46:05,023 --> 00:46:07,514
The bore of a husband
who knows where his slippers are...

548
00:46:07,592 --> 00:46:10,186
but never notices his wife.

549
00:46:10,262 --> 00:46:12,253
But you weren't
the only pimp, Henry.

550
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:15,266
The war was
the greatest pimp of all.

551
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:19,735
And the V-1 s
never affected us until...

552
00:46:19,804 --> 00:46:22,103
the act of love was over.

553
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:54,996
So what will you do when it ends?

554
00:46:55,072 --> 00:46:57,007
lt won't end. I told you.

555
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:59,009
I meant the war.

556
00:47:00,344 --> 00:47:03,143
It's the only certain thing.

557
00:47:03,215 --> 00:47:05,148
What do you mean?

558
00:47:05,217 --> 00:47:07,548
That allows me to see you.

559
00:47:08,853 --> 00:47:10,822
You think love ends...

560
00:47:10,889 --> 00:47:13,016
when you don't see me?

561
00:47:15,494 --> 00:47:17,826
To be is to be perceived.

562
00:47:19,063 --> 00:47:21,259
Do I exist for you
when you're with Henry?

563
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:23,460
Yes.

564
00:47:23,534 --> 00:47:26,231
Isn't that why you stay
with Henry?

565
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:28,465
Because you know this will end?

566
00:47:28,539 --> 00:47:30,838
No.

567
00:47:33,077 --> 00:47:35,342
- We should go to the basement.
- My landlady might be there.

568
00:47:35,414 --> 00:47:36,938
- Does that matter?
- Maybe to her.

569
00:47:37,014 --> 00:47:39,278
- It's close, Maurice.
- I'll go and check.

570
00:47:39,351 --> 00:47:42,251
- Let me go with you.
- I'll be one second.

571
00:47:47,858 --> 00:47:49,291
Hello?

572
00:47:51,929 --> 00:47:54,626
There's nobody there.
It's clear.

573
00:48:47,184 --> 00:48:49,119
I never heard the bang.

574
00:48:50,521 --> 00:48:53,217
I awoke after five minutes...

575
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,851
or five seconds...

576
00:48:56,927 --> 00:48:59,088
to a changed world.

577
00:49:04,101 --> 00:49:07,434
For a moment,
I was free of feeling...

578
00:49:08,507 --> 00:49:11,601
love, hate, jealousy.

579
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:16,271
And it all felt like happiness.

580
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,585
Oh, my God.

581
00:50:30,588 --> 00:50:32,021
You're alive?

582
00:50:36,594 --> 00:50:38,528
You sound disappointed.

583
00:50:38,597 --> 00:50:40,360
You're hurt.

584
00:50:45,003 --> 00:50:47,527
I just cut myself, that's all.

585
00:50:59,317 --> 00:51:02,047
What were you doing
on the floor?

586
00:51:03,255 --> 00:51:04,688
Praying.

587
00:51:05,757 --> 00:51:07,315
To what?

588
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,586
To anything that might exist.

589
00:51:10,728 --> 00:51:15,324
Well, it'd have been more practical
to have come downstairs.

590
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,231
I did.

591
00:51:21,672 --> 00:51:24,972
Well, why didn't you wake me?

592
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:26,737
I tried.

593
00:51:26,811 --> 00:51:28,746
You didn't move.

594
00:51:30,815 --> 00:51:32,373
I don't understand.

595
00:51:33,617 --> 00:51:36,882
I knew for certain
you were dead.

596
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:39,081
There wasn't much
to pray for then, was there?

597
00:51:40,157 --> 00:51:41,351
A miracle.

598
00:51:43,594 --> 00:51:47,121
And we don't believe in those.

599
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:48,291
No.

600
00:51:50,802 --> 00:51:53,702
And that siren means you go.

601
00:51:56,775 --> 00:51:58,298
Yes.

602
00:52:04,148 --> 00:52:05,581
Please don't.

603
00:52:06,483 --> 00:52:09,317
I have to. Henry will--

604
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:11,047
Forget Henry.

605
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:14,824
You don't understand.
You were gone.

606
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:16,291
Now I'm back.

607
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:20,956
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
Sarah, but--

608
00:52:25,135 --> 00:52:27,865
Love doesn't end...

609
00:52:27,938 --> 00:52:30,237
just because
we don't see each other.

610
00:52:31,108 --> 00:52:32,735
Doesn't it?

611
00:52:32,811 --> 00:52:35,005
People go on loving God,
don't they?

612
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:37,411
All their lives.

613
00:52:37,481 --> 00:52:39,608
Without seeing Him.

614
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:43,152
That's not my kind of love.

615
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:45,916
Maybe there's no other kind.

616
00:53:00,038 --> 00:53:02,835
So I was a disappointment
in the end.

617
00:53:02,907 --> 00:53:04,967
I lived.

618
00:53:05,043 --> 00:53:07,237
And that was the end
of the affair...

619
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:10,041
until I met you with that
detective's card in your hand.

620
00:53:11,949 --> 00:53:13,940
I wondered why
we hadn't seen you.

621
00:53:17,355 --> 00:53:20,347
You should go home, Henry.
You'll catch your death.

622
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:25,929
I'm sorry.

623
00:53:37,675 --> 00:53:39,108
Hello.

624
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:50,746
lt was quite easy, sir.
lt was such a crush.

625
00:53:50,822 --> 00:53:54,086
And Mrs. Miles thought I was one
of his friends from the ministry.

626
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:56,626
And Mr. Miles thought
I was one of her friends.

627
00:53:57,829 --> 00:54:00,855
Well, I knew the way
to her room from my boy.

628
00:54:00,931 --> 00:54:03,958
Anybody would have stopped me, I would
have been looking for the toilet.

629
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:05,525
Of course, nobody did.

630
00:54:05,603 --> 00:54:08,400
Did you think it was
a good cocktail party?

631
00:54:08,472 --> 00:54:10,838
Highly successful
I would say, sir.

632
00:54:10,909 --> 00:54:14,606
But Mrs. Miles
looked a bit out of sorts.

633
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:18,842
I refer to this as Exhibit ''D. ''

634
00:54:31,128 --> 00:54:33,063
Did you look at it?

635
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:35,429
I ascertained its nature, sir.

636
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,900
And from one entry,judged
she wasn't the cautious type.

637
00:54:37,969 --> 00:54:40,335
So happy. M returns today.

638
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:43,373
My experience of diaries
is they always give things away, sir.

639
00:54:44,909 --> 00:54:47,809
People invent their little codes.
You soon see through them, sir.

640
00:54:47,878 --> 00:54:50,108
I woke up and
the sun was shining.

641
00:54:50,181 --> 00:54:52,706
This covers several years.

642
00:54:52,784 --> 00:54:54,717
I hope you're satisfied, sir.

643
00:54:54,786 --> 00:54:58,449
Life was going to be happy again.
But last night I dreamt--

644
00:54:58,523 --> 00:55:01,822
I think this may well
close our account, Parkis.

645
00:55:01,893 --> 00:55:05,090
Yeah. I had a feeling
it might, sir.

646
00:55:05,896 --> 00:55:08,490
I have enjoyed
our association, sir...

647
00:55:08,565 --> 00:55:12,092
if one can talk of enjoying
under the sad circumstances.

648
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:14,001
As have l.

649
00:55:14,072 --> 00:55:17,438
So I hope you wouldn't
resent a memento, sir.

650
00:55:22,847 --> 00:55:24,438
There's quite a history
with that.

651
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:28,813
- Do you remember the Bolton case?
- I can't say I do.

652
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:31,355
lt caused quite
a stir at the time, sir.

653
00:55:31,422 --> 00:55:34,016
Lady Bolton,
her maid and a man.

654
00:55:34,092 --> 00:55:36,150
All discovered together.

655
00:55:36,226 --> 00:55:38,751
That ashtray stood
beside the bed, sir.

656
00:55:38,829 --> 00:55:40,797
On the lady's side.

657
00:55:44,568 --> 00:55:47,264
Well, I shall treasure it, Parkis.

658
00:55:49,074 --> 00:55:51,599
lf ashtrays could speak, sir.

659
00:55:51,675 --> 00:55:53,108
lndeed.

660
00:55:56,614 --> 00:55:59,708
Perhaps I should call later, sir,just
to make sure there were no loose ends?

661
00:55:59,784 --> 00:56:01,717
Thank you, Parkis.

662
00:56:03,887 --> 00:56:05,753
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

663
00:56:37,155 --> 00:56:41,454
Sometimes I get tired of trying
to convince him that I love him...

664
00:56:41,525 --> 00:56:43,652
and shall love him forever.

665
00:56:43,728 --> 00:56:47,219
He pounces on my words
like a barrister and twists them.

666
00:56:47,297 --> 00:56:49,231
So what will you do
when it ends?

667
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,791
You think love ends
when you don't see me?

668
00:56:55,139 --> 00:56:57,630
To be is to be perceived.

669
00:56:58,809 --> 00:57:01,108
Do I exist for you
when you're with Henry?

670
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:02,612
Yes.

671
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:08,615
Isn't that why you stay with Henry?
Because you know this will end?

672
00:57:12,556 --> 00:57:14,855
- We should go to the basement.
- My landlady might be there.

673
00:57:14,925 --> 00:57:16,358
- Does that matter?
- Maybe to her.

674
00:57:16,427 --> 00:57:18,759
- It's close, Maurice.
- I'll go and check.

675
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:21,128
- Let me go with you.
- I'll be one second.

676
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,503
Hello?

677
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:33,601
There's nobody there.
It's clear.

678
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:03,063
Oh, God!

679
00:58:08,746 --> 00:58:10,679
Oh, God. Oh, God.

680
00:58:22,693 --> 00:58:24,490
Oh, God, don't take him.

681
00:58:25,163 --> 00:58:27,130
But You had.

682
00:58:30,268 --> 00:58:32,862
Whatever was him was gone.

683
00:58:32,936 --> 00:58:34,871
You'd taken it.

684
00:58:37,608 --> 00:58:40,168
I'd never believed in prayer.

685
00:58:43,213 --> 00:58:47,206
Oh, God, please bring him back.
Let him live.

686
00:58:47,284 --> 00:58:50,686
I don't believe in You,
but please let him live.

687
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:55,657
Dear God, please.

688
00:58:56,728 --> 00:58:58,286
Let him--

689
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:16,376
Dear God, please. Let him live.

690
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:22,411
Please bring him back.

691
00:59:23,487 --> 00:59:25,751
Please don't take him.

692
00:59:28,425 --> 00:59:30,518
I'll give him up forever.

693
00:59:30,594 --> 00:59:33,222
Only please, let him be alive.

694
00:59:34,532 --> 00:59:39,400
Let him live and I promise
I'll never see him again.

695
00:59:47,612 --> 00:59:48,873
Oh, my God.

696
00:59:51,715 --> 00:59:53,182
You're alive?

697
00:59:55,585 --> 00:59:58,452
You sound disappointed.

698
00:59:58,523 --> 01:00:02,356
But if he was alive,
now I was dead.

699
01:00:11,469 --> 01:00:13,766
What were you doing on the floor?

700
01:00:15,373 --> 01:00:17,704
Praying.

701
01:00:17,775 --> 01:00:19,538
To what?

702
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,577
To anything that might exist.

703
01:00:21,646 --> 01:00:25,844
How could I explain to him
what made no sense to me?

704
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:27,577
You didn't move.

705
01:00:27,652 --> 01:00:31,315
I knew for certain you were dead.

706
01:00:31,389 --> 01:00:33,447
Then there wasn't much
to pray for then, was there?

707
01:00:33,523 --> 01:00:34,956
A miracle.

708
01:00:36,728 --> 01:00:39,423
And we don't believe in that.

709
01:00:43,201 --> 01:00:45,293
And that siren means you go.

710
01:00:48,206 --> 01:00:49,639
Yes.

711
01:00:50,807 --> 01:00:55,835
And I knew that nothing in this world
would make sense to me again.

712
01:00:56,914 --> 01:00:58,244
Sorry to disappoint you.

713
01:01:03,253 --> 01:01:05,916
Love doesn't end...

714
01:01:05,989 --> 01:01:07,923
just because we don't
see each other.

715
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,449
Doesn't it?

716
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,757
People go on loving God,
don't they...

717
01:01:12,829 --> 01:01:16,731
all their lives
without seeing Him?

718
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,860
That's not my kind of love.

719
01:01:20,737 --> 01:01:23,331
Maybe there's no other kind.

720
01:01:43,561 --> 01:01:46,757
I can't be held to that promise.

721
01:01:46,831 --> 01:01:49,664
But something told me I would be.

722
01:01:49,733 --> 01:01:51,668
I had tempted fate...

723
01:01:51,735 --> 01:01:53,896
and fate had accepted.

724
01:01:55,139 --> 01:02:00,041
So I was in the desert now,
the desert without him.

725
01:02:02,146 --> 01:02:06,583
I started a tour with Henry,
civil defense in southern England.

726
01:02:07,552 --> 01:02:11,487
Henry and I sleeping side by side
like figures on tombs.

727
01:02:14,057 --> 01:02:17,721
ln the new reinforced shelter
at Bigwell-on-Sea...

728
01:02:17,795 --> 01:02:20,490
a chief warden kissed me.

729
01:02:20,565 --> 01:02:24,001
I allowed him to
but felt nothing.

730
01:02:25,436 --> 01:02:28,302
I'm beginning to believe
in You, God...

731
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:31,101
and maybe that's how You work.

732
01:02:31,175 --> 01:02:35,009
You empty me of love,
then fill that emptiness.

733
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:37,206
They're recommending me
for an O.B.E.

734
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,976
What's that?

735
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:41,518
A step below a C.B.E.

736
01:02:41,585 --> 01:02:45,112
When I retire,
I'll probably be a K.B.E.

737
01:02:45,188 --> 01:02:48,646
It's confusing. Couldn't
they stick to the same letters?

738
01:02:49,927 --> 01:02:52,360
Wouldn't you like to be Lady Miles?

739
01:02:55,967 --> 01:02:59,061
This was the British people's
finest day...

740
01:02:59,135 --> 01:03:02,731
V-E day,
the end of the German war.

741
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:08,269
A man we seem to have
seen before somewhere...

742
01:03:08,346 --> 01:03:10,940
looks down
from a balcony in Whitehall.

743
01:03:22,893 --> 01:03:26,193
The whole of London seemed happy
because there was peace...

744
01:03:26,264 --> 01:03:28,255
and there were no more bombs.

745
01:03:28,331 --> 01:03:30,960
But I'm not sure
I like the peace.

746
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:41,768
I walked his walks.

747
01:03:44,614 --> 01:03:47,208
Tried to think where he'd be.

748
01:03:52,389 --> 01:03:54,324
Then I gave up.

749
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:58,657
I thought that now
the world is at peace...

750
01:03:58,728 --> 01:04:01,128
maybe I should have some.

751
01:04:13,878 --> 01:04:15,971
I told him it all.

752
01:04:16,047 --> 01:04:20,780
And Whoever heard my promise
must have heard it too...

753
01:04:20,851 --> 01:04:23,512
and must have known it already...

754
01:04:23,588 --> 01:04:26,385
since God knows everything.

755
01:04:29,092 --> 01:04:32,255
How cruel that knowledge seemed.

756
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:35,492
lt knew what I would say
before I made that promise.

757
01:04:37,134 --> 01:04:40,331
Knew it would keep me to it.

758
01:04:40,403 --> 01:04:42,998
Knew me the way
his hands knew me.

759
01:04:44,108 --> 01:04:45,972
Sarah, darling.

760
01:04:48,746 --> 01:04:49,838
You.

761
01:04:49,914 --> 01:04:51,905
Knew I would meet him
on the stairs.

762
01:04:51,983 --> 01:04:53,916
- Been out for a walk?
- Yes.

763
01:04:53,985 --> 01:04:55,282
It's a filthy night.

764
01:04:55,353 --> 01:04:58,344
You're wet through. One day
you'll catch your death of cold.

765
01:04:58,422 --> 01:04:59,547
Good night.

766
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:02,981
Knew he would hate me.

767
01:05:09,099 --> 01:05:11,465
- Wednesday.
- Wednesday. Let me check.

768
01:05:13,903 --> 01:05:16,338
- Would Thursday do?
- Thursday then.

769
01:05:16,407 --> 01:05:18,840
The Park Lane Hotel at 1..00.

770
01:05:23,146 --> 01:05:27,208
I took my time.
I didn't want to be early.

771
01:05:28,284 --> 01:05:30,344
Why did you want to meet?

772
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:35,222
I wanted to tell you I'd been dead
for the last two years.

773
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:38,318
I can't be without you any longer.

774
01:05:38,396 --> 01:05:39,693
I think he's lonely.

775
01:05:39,764 --> 01:05:41,755
But, of course, I didn't.

776
01:05:41,831 --> 01:05:45,097
You know he's never really
noticed me, not for years.

777
01:05:47,605 --> 01:05:49,936
Maybe you've given him reason.

778
01:05:50,007 --> 01:05:52,373
What reason could I give?

779
01:05:53,878 --> 01:05:56,311
What reason did you give me?

780
01:06:01,385 --> 01:06:02,612
None.

781
01:06:12,963 --> 01:06:15,954
- Are you on a new book?
- Of course.

782
01:06:16,032 --> 01:06:19,230
It's not about us, is it?
The one you threatened to write.

783
01:06:19,302 --> 01:06:21,065
A book takes a year to write.

784
01:06:21,137 --> 01:06:23,072
It's too hard work for revenge.

785
01:06:24,175 --> 01:06:26,302
lf you knew how little
you had to revenge--

786
01:06:26,376 --> 01:06:29,072
No, I'm joking.
We had a good time together.

787
01:06:29,146 --> 01:06:31,079
I mean, we're adults and...

788
01:06:31,148 --> 01:06:34,139
we knew it had to end sometime.

789
01:06:34,217 --> 01:06:37,346
And now we can lunch
and talk about Henry.

790
01:06:42,326 --> 01:06:45,523
ln the old days,
he would have followed.

791
01:06:45,596 --> 01:06:49,259
We would have made up
or made love.

792
01:07:07,585 --> 01:07:12,648
I said to God, as I might
have said to my father...

793
01:07:12,722 --> 01:07:15,351
''Dear God, I'm tired.

794
01:07:16,427 --> 01:07:19,954
I'm tired of being without him.

795
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:22,623
And it's all because of You. ''

796
01:07:24,902 --> 01:07:28,668
Dr. Gilbert's appointment.
I'd almost forgotten.

797
01:07:29,706 --> 01:07:31,675
He asked me how I felt.

798
01:07:32,742 --> 01:07:35,438
I said I felt nothing.

799
01:07:35,512 --> 01:07:38,481
There was a stone
where my heart should be.

800
01:07:40,918 --> 01:07:42,851
I need help, Father.

801
01:07:44,688 --> 01:07:46,621
You know, Sarah,
God granted us free will.

802
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:50,056
Good. So it's settled.
I'm leaving my husband.

803
01:07:50,126 --> 01:07:54,188
- You can't.
- Why can't l? I'm a whore and a liar.

804
01:07:54,264 --> 01:07:56,630
I'm asking Henry for a divorce.

805
01:08:02,873 --> 01:08:05,034
You can't because you're good.

806
01:08:06,943 --> 01:08:09,742
Better than any person I know.

807
01:08:09,813 --> 01:08:13,773
You're wrong, Father,
and you don't know me.

808
01:08:15,786 --> 01:08:19,016
I found a small boy
sleeping on the steps...

809
01:08:19,088 --> 01:08:21,956
with a birthmark
covering his face...

810
01:08:22,025 --> 01:08:25,462
and wondered what kind of God
would give a child that.

811
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:27,554
Are you lost?

812
01:08:27,631 --> 01:08:30,600
It's all right.
It's all right.

813
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:32,636
Where do you live then?

814
01:08:34,805 --> 01:08:36,931
- You'll be all right now?
- Yes, ma'am.

815
01:08:37,006 --> 01:08:42,069
I kissed his cheek
and wished I could wash it away.

816
01:08:42,145 --> 01:08:44,079
And suddenly I felt happy again.

817
01:08:45,149 --> 01:08:47,082
I could free myself of this.

818
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:50,782
I am...

819
01:08:50,854 --> 01:08:52,685
leaving you.

820
01:08:53,756 --> 01:08:57,783
For the last five years...

821
01:08:58,962 --> 01:09:01,954
I have been...

822
01:09:02,032 --> 01:09:03,966
in love...

823
01:09:04,033 --> 01:09:06,332
with Maurice.

824
01:09:06,403 --> 01:09:09,270
I love you.

825
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,399
Do you know that?

826
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:19,108
Why now, Henry?

827
01:09:19,182 --> 01:09:21,117
Why do you say that now?

828
01:09:24,287 --> 01:09:26,414
I had a drink with Bendrix.

829
01:09:32,829 --> 01:09:34,990
A horrible drink.

830
01:09:37,167 --> 01:09:39,328
I can't do without you.

831
01:09:40,404 --> 01:09:42,804
Oh, yes, you can, I thought.

832
01:09:42,872 --> 01:09:46,774
You changed your newspaper once
and you soon got used to it.

833
01:09:46,844 --> 01:09:48,936
What's wrong, Henry?

834
01:09:49,012 --> 01:09:52,073
Did Bendrix upset you in some way?

835
01:09:55,019 --> 01:09:57,953
I know I haven't been much
of a husband to you, my dear.

836
01:09:58,021 --> 01:09:59,989
We are good friends.

837
01:10:01,524 --> 01:10:04,323
You can do without a friend.

838
01:10:05,529 --> 01:10:07,462
Don't leave me, Sarah.

839
01:10:10,033 --> 01:10:12,365
Stick it out a few more years.

840
01:10:13,604 --> 01:10:16,731
I'll try. I promise.

841
01:10:21,979 --> 01:10:25,608
Is this coincidence?
I wondered.

842
01:10:25,682 --> 01:10:28,480
Or the way life happens?

843
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:33,284
And if this is life,
am I stuck with it?

844
01:10:33,356 --> 01:10:35,756
But whatever it is...

845
01:10:35,826 --> 01:10:37,817
I can't fight it anymore.

846
01:10:38,561 --> 01:10:42,430
lt has won and we have lost.

847
01:10:58,148 --> 01:11:00,082
- Hello?
- Sarah.

848
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:02,981
She's not here.

849
01:11:03,052 --> 01:11:06,180
I know your voice, Sarah.
Talk to me.

850
01:11:55,372 --> 01:11:56,634
Stop here.

851
01:11:58,509 --> 01:12:01,136
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much, guv.

852
01:12:12,456 --> 01:12:14,252
One, please.

853
01:12:17,327 --> 01:12:18,918
Thank you, sir.

854
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:11,975
How did you get it?

855
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:18,752
You had a drinks party last week.

856
01:13:20,423 --> 01:13:23,359
- Yes. That small man.
- Yes.

857
01:13:24,427 --> 01:13:26,395
He is my snoop.
- On what?

858
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:31,099
How ridiculous.

859
01:13:32,735 --> 01:13:35,863
It's no more
ridiculous than you.

860
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:38,100
Why didn't you tell me?

861
01:13:38,175 --> 01:13:43,112
I tried. Each time I tried,
something would happen.

862
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:47,275
- That's mumbo jumbo, Sarah.
- lt doesn't work like that.

863
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,783
Accidents.

864
01:13:48,851 --> 01:13:53,653
Little things.
God is in the details, Maurice.

865
01:13:53,724 --> 01:13:55,520
You can't believe that.

866
01:13:55,591 --> 01:13:58,220
Do you believe in things
you can't see?

867
01:14:00,596 --> 01:14:02,564
- You mean Him?
- I mean you.

868
01:14:05,101 --> 01:14:09,265
You see, I never stopped loving you,
even though I couldn't see you.

869
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:15,372
My mother baptized me a Catholic.

870
01:14:15,444 --> 01:14:19,073
My father was Jewish,
so we never practiced.

871
01:14:19,149 --> 01:14:22,778
But she always said
she hoped it would take.

872
01:14:22,853 --> 01:14:24,649
Like a vaccination.

873
01:14:26,622 --> 01:14:30,957
I've only made
two promises in my life.

874
01:14:31,028 --> 01:14:33,826
One was to marry Henry...

875
01:14:33,896 --> 01:14:36,364
the other to stop seeing you.

876
01:14:38,402 --> 01:14:41,064
And I'm too weak to keep either.

877
01:14:44,408 --> 01:14:46,671
I know you don't believe in Him...

878
01:14:49,011 --> 01:14:51,275
but try to.

879
01:14:51,347 --> 01:14:53,212
Talk to Him.

880
01:14:54,283 --> 01:14:55,614
I can't.

881
01:14:55,685 --> 01:14:57,619
Tell Him I'm sorry.

882
01:14:57,688 --> 01:14:59,985
I'm too human...

883
01:15:00,056 --> 01:15:02,617
too weak.

884
01:15:02,693 --> 01:15:07,630
Tell Him I can't keep my promises.

885
01:15:07,698 --> 01:15:10,599
I'm tired of being without you.

886
01:15:13,703 --> 01:15:17,800
- Let's get you home.
- I don't want to go home.

887
01:15:18,708 --> 01:15:20,141
I know.

888
01:16:04,854 --> 01:16:07,414
So have we broken the spell?

889
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,351
The world didn't end, did it?

890
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:15,761
lt did, in a way.

891
01:16:15,832 --> 01:16:17,800
But then, it always did.

892
01:16:19,935 --> 01:16:21,869
Can I sleep now, Maurice?

893
01:16:22,939 --> 01:16:24,872
Please let me sleep.

894
01:16:52,769 --> 01:16:54,737
- It's Henry.
- Don't answer it.

895
01:16:54,805 --> 01:16:57,932
Why not? We'll have
to tell him sometime.

896
01:16:58,007 --> 01:17:00,533
- Come away with me.
- Where?

897
01:17:00,609 --> 01:17:02,770
Anywhere. Brighton.

898
01:17:03,546 --> 01:17:05,912
I want a few days peace
before the arguments begin.

899
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:10,109
- Well, Henry never argues.
- I wasn't talking about Henry.

900
01:17:15,926 --> 01:17:18,121
Pain is easy to write.

901
01:17:19,195 --> 01:17:22,393
ln pain, we're
all drably individual.

902
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,434
But what can one write
about happiness?

903
01:17:50,993 --> 01:17:53,622
lt doesn't suit you.
And it's mine.

904
01:17:53,697 --> 01:17:56,359
- You want it? There's a price.
- How much?

905
01:18:01,137 --> 01:18:03,072
Can I pay again?

906
01:18:05,876 --> 01:18:09,311
- I want children, you know.
- How many?

907
01:18:09,378 --> 01:18:12,609
- I'll start with one.
- Only one?

908
01:18:12,681 --> 01:18:14,615
You want to start with two?

909
01:18:15,652 --> 01:18:17,779
Is that a promise?

910
01:18:17,854 --> 01:18:19,287
Yes.

911
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:29,364
Let's get you back to the hotel.

912
01:18:34,404 --> 01:18:37,372
-Just those two.
- Very good, sir.

913
01:18:49,886 --> 01:18:52,286
lt is a bit of a mess.
Yeah, you're right.

914
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,028
- Business going well?
- Yes, it's going--

915
01:18:59,095 --> 01:19:01,029
Still on the job?
Don't worry.

916
01:19:01,096 --> 01:19:03,327
- Oh, dear.
- Here. Come with me.

917
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:06,163
Come. So where's
your boy this time?

918
01:19:06,235 --> 01:19:08,295
I left him at home, sir.

919
01:19:08,371 --> 01:19:11,966
Hardly a wise move. He'd have
had the sense not to get noticed.

920
01:19:12,042 --> 01:19:15,238
You think so, sir?
Perhaps I wasn't cut out for this job.

921
01:19:15,311 --> 01:19:18,577
Tell your employer
the circumstances are unique.

922
01:19:18,648 --> 01:19:23,085
What was your phrase?
The party in question is a writer.

923
01:19:23,153 --> 01:19:26,588
- They notice everything.
- They certainly seem to, sir.

924
01:19:28,358 --> 01:19:31,850
- So who's hired you this time?
- I'm not at liberty to say, sir.

925
01:19:31,927 --> 01:19:34,488
Let me guess. The jealous husband.

926
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,666
I never expected to be
recalled to this case, sir.

927
01:19:39,735 --> 01:19:41,703
Yours is a secure profession.

928
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:45,467
As long as fools like us love,
your employment never ends.

929
01:19:45,542 --> 01:19:47,475
You could put it like that.

930
01:19:47,543 --> 01:19:49,944
And love never ends, does it?

931
01:19:51,113 --> 01:19:52,706
lt seems not.

932
01:19:52,782 --> 01:19:54,806
So what do you need?

933
01:19:54,885 --> 01:19:57,614
Photographs of us
in flagrante delicto?

934
01:19:57,686 --> 01:20:02,055
Copies of hotel bills? Evidence of
soiled sheets? We'd be happy to oblige.

935
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:06,788
No, my brief is to follow you.
lnform him as to your whereabouts.

936
01:20:06,863 --> 01:20:08,796
Which, of course, you'll do.

937
01:20:08,864 --> 01:20:11,925
I'm obliged to, sir, under
the terms of my employment, posthaste.

938
01:20:12,002 --> 01:20:15,493
Won't you need supplementary evidence?
The divorce courts will demand it.

939
01:20:17,873 --> 01:20:20,967
They generally do, sir,
if it come to that.

940
01:20:21,043 --> 01:20:24,707
Well, Exhibit ''A.''

941
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:29,240
Receipt for two sandwiches
bought on the train to Brighton.

942
01:20:29,319 --> 01:20:32,777
Mutual sandwiches are surely
evidence of intimacy, aren't they?

943
01:20:32,855 --> 01:20:35,654
- They could be so construed, sir.
- Exhibit '' B.''

944
01:20:35,725 --> 01:20:37,658
Two tickets for a Big Dipper.

945
01:20:37,726 --> 01:20:40,957
- You seem to be doing my job for me.
- Yes, but we haven't quite got there.

946
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:43,625
What would clinch it for us?

947
01:20:43,699 --> 01:20:46,930
What would make
divorce a certainty?

948
01:20:52,108 --> 01:20:57,136
Generally, sir, some kind
of photographic evidence of--

949
01:20:59,149 --> 01:21:01,117
Of intimacy.

950
01:21:03,787 --> 01:21:07,984
Would be most useful, sir,
if it came to such a pass.

951
01:21:08,057 --> 01:21:11,858
lt will, Parkis.
lt most certainly will.

952
01:21:43,592 --> 01:21:45,025
Here.

953
01:21:52,234 --> 01:21:54,203
I dreamt we had a child.

954
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:56,295
We will.

955
01:21:56,372 --> 01:21:58,466
We were on the bed together.

956
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:02,601
The room filled up with water.
There was a child between us.

957
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:04,976
Why water?

958
01:22:05,047 --> 01:22:07,641
The sea had come in the window.

959
01:22:25,034 --> 01:22:27,662
So you'll marry me.

960
01:22:30,907 --> 01:22:33,101
That's a promise.

961
01:23:03,472 --> 01:23:07,466
The prince regent began building it
for his mistress, Mrs. Fitzherbert.

962
01:23:07,543 --> 01:23:09,511
Beautiful but flawed.

963
01:23:09,578 --> 01:23:12,604
- How was she flawed?
- She was Catholic.

964
01:23:12,681 --> 01:23:14,877
lmpossible, of course.

965
01:23:14,951 --> 01:23:16,578
So he loved her.

966
01:23:16,653 --> 01:23:21,851
Yes, but he married Princess Caroline
of Brunswick who was Protestant...

967
01:23:21,925 --> 01:23:23,619
but huge.

968
01:23:23,693 --> 01:23:27,685
And he built this huge folly
to impossibility.

969
01:23:27,764 --> 01:23:30,493
- Not now, Henry.
- Forgive me, Sarah. I had to.

970
01:23:30,567 --> 01:23:34,435
- Oh, God, please. Henry, not now.
- You had to what, Henry?

971
01:23:36,338 --> 01:23:38,533
- Talk.
- Go back home.

972
01:23:38,608 --> 01:23:40,837
- You can't hold on to her forever.
- I know, but--

973
01:23:40,909 --> 01:23:45,141
lt hardly suits you, Henry,
the role of a jealous husband.

974
01:23:45,215 --> 01:23:47,444
Please, I don't mean
to make a scene.

975
01:23:47,516 --> 01:23:50,485
Henry, go home.

976
01:23:50,552 --> 01:23:53,043
I'm not jealous, Bendrix.

977
01:23:54,123 --> 01:23:56,057
What was it you said?

978
01:23:56,126 --> 01:24:00,153
Lovers are jealous.
Husbands are ridiculous.

979
01:24:02,431 --> 01:24:04,922
I was never her lover.

980
01:24:05,001 --> 01:24:07,060
Not much of a husband either,
I'm afraid.

981
01:24:07,136 --> 01:24:09,400
But you hired our detective.

982
01:24:09,471 --> 01:24:11,735
I had to find out where she was.

983
01:24:11,807 --> 01:24:16,211
So you know. She wants a divorce.

984
01:24:16,279 --> 01:24:19,510
That won't be possible, old man.

985
01:24:19,582 --> 01:24:21,515
You'll contest it?

986
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:24,780
No, but it would take
at least three months.

987
01:24:24,854 --> 01:24:28,220
Well, what's three months, Henry,
out of a lifetime?

988
01:24:29,658 --> 01:24:31,957
Half.

989
01:24:32,028 --> 01:24:34,519
Half of what?

990
01:24:34,596 --> 01:24:37,064
Of a lifetime, I'm afraid.

991
01:24:39,002 --> 01:24:41,993
Sarah's dying.

992
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:46,097
Her doctor called the night
she didn't come back...

993
01:24:46,176 --> 01:24:48,507
with the result of some tests.

994
01:24:50,246 --> 01:24:52,237
I knocked on your door.

995
01:24:54,016 --> 01:24:56,417
I imagined you were both there.

996
01:24:59,655 --> 01:25:02,453
How oddly we behave
at such moments.

997
01:25:19,175 --> 01:25:21,541
You shouldn't get wet, darling.

998
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:24,273
- Don't you like the rain, Henry?
- Yes, dear, but--

999
01:25:24,346 --> 01:25:28,476
You've heard news, Henry.
Is it good?

1000
01:25:29,752 --> 01:25:31,219
No, dear.

1001
01:25:32,588 --> 01:25:37,322
You see, Maurice, never make a promise.
You may have to keep it.

1002
01:25:45,033 --> 01:25:49,027
You should never have been
jealous of me, Bendrix.

1003
01:25:53,877 --> 01:25:59,474
I did Sarah a great disservice
when I married her. I realize that now.

1004
01:26:00,884 --> 01:26:03,351
I'm not the sort
that makes a lover.

1005
01:26:05,654 --> 01:26:08,248
She wanted someone like you.

1006
01:26:09,091 --> 01:26:11,582
I'm not sure
it's as simple as that.

1007
01:26:15,631 --> 01:26:18,122
lf you don't mind me asking...

1008
01:26:19,402 --> 01:26:22,632
I'd like you there
when the time comes.

1009
01:26:22,704 --> 01:26:24,194
lt may not come.

1010
01:26:26,408 --> 01:26:29,502
You of all people
don't believe in miracles.

1011
01:26:29,578 --> 01:26:31,944
No, but Sarah does.

1012
01:26:35,484 --> 01:26:39,421
I'd always believed that
I'd be the one to die first...

1013
01:26:41,123 --> 01:26:43,819
and that Sarah
would know what to do.

1014
01:26:47,396 --> 01:26:49,456
Are you at a loss, Henry?

1015
01:26:53,403 --> 01:26:55,337
I am quite.

1016
01:26:58,341 --> 01:27:02,538
And it would save you a bit
if you moved in with us.

1017
01:27:02,612 --> 01:27:07,378
Sarah always said your books weren't
as successful as they should have been.

1018
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:16,420
You could be there, working in
the daytime, while I'm at the ministry.

1019
01:27:16,492 --> 01:27:21,054
And at night, we could both--

1020
01:27:27,970 --> 01:27:31,770
And so I moved to the north side
of the common...

1021
01:27:31,841 --> 01:27:35,777
and, oddly enough,
I felt instantly at home.

1022
01:27:45,287 --> 01:27:47,051
Can I help you, Father?

1023
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:51,721
- I've come about Mrs. Miles.
- She's indisposed.

1024
01:27:51,793 --> 01:27:55,024
You mean, she's ill, don't you?

1025
01:27:55,097 --> 01:27:58,625
- Yes, I suppose I do.
- Yes.

1026
01:27:59,702 --> 01:28:03,502
She's been to see me several times,
and I know she'd like to see me before--

1027
01:28:03,573 --> 01:28:06,667
She's left word with me
she's not to be disturbed.

1028
01:28:06,743 --> 01:28:08,676
Is her husband here?

1029
01:28:16,752 --> 01:28:21,122
- She told me about you.
- I know she did.

1030
01:28:21,189 --> 01:28:23,123
I'm the lover, Father.

1031
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:39,373
Who was that?

1032
01:28:46,783 --> 01:28:48,216
The postman.

1033
01:28:51,354 --> 01:28:53,322
What did he bring?

1034
01:28:55,591 --> 01:28:58,059
He had the wrong address.

1035
01:29:02,265 --> 01:29:05,097
How odd for a postman.

1036
01:29:15,444 --> 01:29:18,413
You know what happened that day?

1037
01:29:20,582 --> 01:29:23,143
You thought I was dead...

1038
01:29:23,219 --> 01:29:25,153
and I wasn't.

1039
01:29:27,489 --> 01:29:28,957
No, darling.

1040
01:29:30,893 --> 01:29:33,360
Something happened in that room.

1041
01:29:35,163 --> 01:29:39,225
There were the same walls
around me...

1042
01:29:39,301 --> 01:29:42,760
the same sunlight
coming in the window...

1043
01:29:44,974 --> 01:29:48,341
but nothing will
ever be the same again.

1044
01:29:49,779 --> 01:29:52,542
You can't believe this, Sarah.

1045
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:57,251
But it's true.

1046
01:29:58,621 --> 01:30:01,851
I never loved anyone
as I loved you.

1047
01:30:03,493 --> 01:30:07,189
And when you came through that door
with blood on your face...

1048
01:30:09,599 --> 01:30:12,261
another kind of love
came with you.

1049
01:30:14,002 --> 01:30:16,493
And I caught belief...

1050
01:30:16,572 --> 01:30:18,163
like a disease.

1051
01:30:19,475 --> 01:30:22,000
I fell into belief like I'd...

1052
01:30:23,412 --> 01:30:25,505
fallen into love.

1053
01:30:26,582 --> 01:30:29,073
And I tried to fight it...

1054
01:30:31,787 --> 01:30:34,721
but I haven't any fight left.

1055
01:30:56,511 --> 01:30:58,810
lt wasn't the postman, was it?

1056
01:31:00,783 --> 01:31:02,682
No, it wasn't.

1057
01:31:04,819 --> 01:31:07,948
Dear Maurice,
you can't go on fighting.

1058
01:31:08,024 --> 01:31:10,618
It's only love, after all.

1059
01:31:46,662 --> 01:31:49,721
So You're taking her...

1060
01:31:49,798 --> 01:31:52,529
but You haven't got me yet.

1061
01:31:52,601 --> 01:31:55,627
I don't want Your peace
and Your love.

1062
01:31:56,905 --> 01:32:00,033
I wanted Sarah for a lifetime...

1063
01:32:00,109 --> 01:32:02,509
and You're taking her from me.

1064
01:32:03,578 --> 01:32:06,172
So I hate You, God.

1065
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:11,277
I hate You as though You existed.

1066
01:32:28,203 --> 01:32:32,003
You have to help me, Bendrix.
I can't.

1067
01:32:32,073 --> 01:32:33,904
I will.

1068
01:32:33,975 --> 01:32:36,706
I can't live in a world
where she's gone.

1069
01:32:40,416 --> 01:32:42,542
I'll help you.

1070
01:32:58,801 --> 01:33:02,668
I would have taken care of
all the arrangements, if I'd known.

1071
01:33:02,738 --> 01:33:04,899
Surely you disapprove of cremation?

1072
01:33:04,974 --> 01:33:06,998
I would have arranged
a Catholic burial.

1073
01:33:07,076 --> 01:33:09,340
But she wasn't a Catholic,
was she, Henry?

1074
01:33:09,412 --> 01:33:11,845
We recognize
the baptism of desire.

1075
01:33:13,948 --> 01:33:16,542
She said things
that seemed like prayers.

1076
01:33:16,618 --> 01:33:19,782
We've made all the arrangements.
We can't alter things now, Father.

1077
01:33:19,854 --> 01:33:22,345
You wouldn't want talk, Henry.
There's the notice in the Times.

1078
01:33:24,827 --> 01:33:27,989
lf you'd come a little sooner, Father--
Please, don't think--

1079
01:33:28,064 --> 01:33:30,032
I think nothing
bad of you, Mr. Miles.

1080
01:33:30,099 --> 01:33:32,567
- Perhaps me?
- Don't worry, Mr. Bendrix.

1081
01:33:32,635 --> 01:33:35,194
Nothing you can do
will affect her now.

1082
01:33:39,108 --> 01:33:41,702
- She was a good woman.
- She was nothing of the sort.

1083
01:33:41,777 --> 01:33:43,711
She could put the blinkers
on any man.

1084
01:33:43,779 --> 01:33:46,179
She deceived you, Father,
as she deceived her husband and me.

1085
01:33:46,247 --> 01:33:48,181
- She was a consummate liar.
- You've no right.

1086
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:51,047
- Let the poor man rave.
- Don't give me your professional pity!

1087
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:54,418
-Keep it for your confessional!
-You can find me there anytime you want.

1088
01:33:54,489 --> 01:33:56,082
I don't want you.
I'm no Sarah.

1089
01:33:56,158 --> 01:33:57,921
- I'm sorry, Father.
- No need to be.

1090
01:33:59,127 --> 01:34:01,153
I know when a man is in pain.

1091
01:34:03,532 --> 01:34:06,626
I'm not in pain, Father.
I'm in hate.

1092
01:34:06,702 --> 01:34:10,103
I hate Sarah, because she was
a tart to your mumbo jumbo.

1093
01:34:10,171 --> 01:34:12,537
I hate Henry,
because she stuck to him.

1094
01:34:12,608 --> 01:34:17,511
And I hate you and your imaginary God,
because you took her away from us.

1095
01:34:19,914 --> 01:34:23,009
- You are a good hater.
- To hell with all of you!

1096
01:35:02,358 --> 01:35:04,622
I'm sorry, Henry.

1097
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,795
The thing is, Bendrix...

1098
01:35:15,604 --> 01:35:17,662
I always knew.

1099
01:35:19,975 --> 01:35:22,204
I knew she was with someone...

1100
01:35:24,212 --> 01:35:26,443
but I never thought you.

1101
01:35:29,918 --> 01:35:31,886
But the odd thing is...

1102
01:35:33,756 --> 01:35:35,724
I'm glad it was.

1103
01:35:55,478 --> 01:35:58,970
It's a sad pleasure
to see you here, sir...

1104
01:35:59,047 --> 01:36:01,015
where bygones are always bygones.

1105
01:36:01,082 --> 01:36:04,347
Do you always follow your people
as far as this?

1106
01:36:05,421 --> 01:36:08,219
She was a very fine lady, sir.

1107
01:36:08,289 --> 01:36:11,190
At a cocktail party,
she handed me a glass of sherry.

1108
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:13,728
Was it South African sherry?

1109
01:36:13,796 --> 01:36:15,764
I wouldn't know, sir.

1110
01:36:15,831 --> 01:36:18,425
There weren't many like her.

1111
01:36:18,501 --> 01:36:21,298
My boy, now,
he's always speaking of her.

1112
01:36:21,369 --> 01:36:24,134
How is your boy, Parkis?

1113
01:36:24,206 --> 01:36:28,198
He's exceptionally well, sir.
Though he's a bit upset today.

1114
01:36:28,277 --> 01:36:31,212
He imagined she'd be buried
in a Catholic way.

1115
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:33,543
And why would he think that?

1116
01:36:33,615 --> 01:36:36,380
Young boys, sir,
they get these ideas.

1117
01:36:36,452 --> 01:36:39,909
Though I have to admit,
even I can't explain it.

1118
01:36:39,988 --> 01:36:42,650
Explain what?

1119
01:36:42,725 --> 01:36:47,492
On the day of her assignation,
she walked him to a tube.

1120
01:36:47,563 --> 01:36:51,863
She thought he was lost, gave him
a coin and kissed him on his cheek.

1121
01:36:51,934 --> 01:36:53,993
On his afflicted cheek, sir.

1122
01:36:54,069 --> 01:36:56,060
And over the weeks
that followed...

1123
01:36:56,137 --> 01:36:58,662
his affliction gradually went away.

1124
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:02,073
I tried to keep him rational,
but he swears it was because of her.

1125
01:37:04,212 --> 01:37:06,646
Say hello to Mr. Bendrix, Lance.

1126
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:27,030
Hello, sir.

1127
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:42,911
I wrote at the start
that this was a diary of hate.

1128
01:37:42,984 --> 01:37:46,181
I hated You as though You existed.

1129
01:37:46,255 --> 01:37:49,155
Now I am tired of hating...

1130
01:37:49,224 --> 01:37:51,215
but You're still there.

1131
01:37:51,292 --> 01:37:55,319
So Your cunning is infinite.

1132
01:37:55,396 --> 01:37:58,422
You used my hate to win
my acknowledgement.

1133
01:37:58,500 --> 01:37:59,899
Thank you, Henry.

1134
01:37:59,969 --> 01:38:02,095
And I've only one prayer left.

1135
01:38:03,639 --> 01:38:06,506
Dear God, forget about me.

1136
01:38:07,576 --> 01:38:11,136
Look after her and Henry.
