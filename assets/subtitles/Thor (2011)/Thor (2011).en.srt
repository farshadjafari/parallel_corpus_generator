1
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:47,802
Your Highness, we celebrate your victory.

2
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:50,805
Try again next week, Ander?

3
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:52,932
We are at your service.

4
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:00,982
That was a stunning display, Thor.

5
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:06,153
You were victorious,
despite the trouble with your sword's grip.

6
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:09,282
- Trouble?
- Plainly, it was too slick.

7
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:11,617
I'll reprimand the dwarves for you.

8
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:12,994
Good idea.

9
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:23,629
Sif.

10
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,592
You missed seeing my victory.

11
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,803
I left right after your opponents
threw you back your weapon.

12
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:36,142
Well, there was a problem with the grip
due to the dwarves' habit of...

13
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:40,021
So now you're blaming the dwarves.
Whose idea was that? Loki's?

14
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:42,481
Are you saying
I shouldn't have won today's match?

15
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,275
Not just today's.

16
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:51,073
A comment like that
requires an explanation, Sif.

17
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,868
I'll tell you what needs explaining, Thor.

18
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,537
Why you have never once
ceded victory to the Einherjar,

19
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:59,165
the most celebrated warriors in Asgard!

20
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:01,209
I am simply more skilled than they.

21
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:02,418
How can that be?

22
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:05,880
They have battled the fiercest
creatures in all the nine realms,

23
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:09,008
and you have never even
left the royal grounds.

24
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,886
You forget I also have the strength of Odin.

25
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:16,349
Yes, and the authority.
They have no choice but to lose.

26
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:19,268
Why do you have so little faith in me, Sif?

27
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,188
I am the only one who has faith in you.

28
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:25,566
Everyone else treats you
like a spoiled child!

29
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,609
That is enough!

30
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,201
You've never had
an honest fight in your life.

31
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:39,038
Since you're a fair hand with a blade,

32
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:42,208
perhaps you should
make an honest man out of me.

33
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:45,044
Be careful how you jest.

34
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:47,129
Choose your weapon, wench.

35
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,433
A barn tool.
You think less of my skill than I realized.

36
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,033
Good-bye, Thor.

37
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:21,789
Thor was wrong about you, Sif.

38
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:24,083
You'll fit right in with the Valkyries.

39
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:29,839
You do your brother no favors, Loki.
Stop protecting him.

40
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:50,276
There we were,

41
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,696
clinging to the side of
a sheer mountain of ice,

42
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:57,450
plumes of fire
billowing up from the gorge below.

43
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,371
Fire? In Jštunheim?

44
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:04,165
Dragons, love.

45
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:06,584
How many were after you?

46
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,294
- Seven.
- Ten.

47
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:10,129
At least a dozen.

48
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:16,469
And Frost Giants were
advancing on the horizon.

49
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:18,679
There was no escape, but...

50
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:23,226
But the Warriors Three would not be
so easily diverted from their quest,

51
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:27,980
for the Sword of Surtur
is worth risking both life and limb.

52
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:35,488
Well, look who it is! Greetings, Thor.

53
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:38,324
Congratulations on your victory
in today's match.

54
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:42,703
Of course, his victory pales to
those found outside the arena.

55
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,878
Perhaps you'd like to
join us on our next quest, Thor.

56
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:52,338
You know he can't, Hogun.

57
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:54,215
He's not allowed to leave the kingdom.

58
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,054
You dare mock the prince of Asgard?

59
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:05,059
Thor, we speak only in jest.
We're friends, remember?

60
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,191
What crawled into his keg?

61
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,366
Your Eminence, we managed to learn

62
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,785
that the Valkyries have
established a new training camp

63
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,372
in the branches of Yggdrasill,
west of Svartalfheim.

64
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,584
Father.

65
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:36,507
Skala, how could you
come by this information

66
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:39,427
when the scout tracking them
has failed to return?

67
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:44,432
We were able to follow Brunhilde
after she had secretly met with Lady Sif.

68
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:48,686
Thank you, all.
This concludes today's council.

69
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:50,563
Gentlemen.

70
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:04,160
Now, Son, tell me what troubles you.

71
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:08,247
Father, I wish your permission to ride
with the Einherjar on one of their patrols.

72
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:09,749
You know my answer.

73
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,417
But I do not agree with it.

74
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:14,754
You are the son of Odin, and, as such,

75
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:17,757
you have different responsibilities
than that of a warrior.

76
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,927
But at least a warrior knows
the true limits of his abilities.

77
00:08:21,177 --> 00:08:26,098
I see what brings you here.
You believe you've outgrown your training.

78
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:31,229
Some say the Einherjar let me win, Father.
Is that true?

79
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,940
Yes.

80
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:36,317
Why?

81
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:40,404
You chose to turn your training
into public entertainment.

82
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:45,743
But this kingdom cannot afford to see
its prince defeated week after week.

83
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:48,746
So you, too, doubt my abilities.

84
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,084
Being a king is not about
drawing a sword in battle.

85
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,628
It's about avoiding battle entirely.

86
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:58,923
Hiding from conflict sounds more like
one of Loki's strengths.

87
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,800
Perhaps he should inherit your throne.

88
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:06,430
Perhaps he will. But as for you,
there will be no leaving Asgard.

89
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:11,143
I am your king and your father,
and you will obey me.

90
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,172
You may come out, Algrim.

91
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:45,344
I'm impressed.
You have detected me in shadow.

92
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,138
Not many can.

93
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:50,683
Truth be told, I can't either.

94
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:52,935
But I don't know of a time that
you didn't come and check on me

95
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,146
after I had a fight with Father.

96
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:59,358
Typically, because you would insist on
pursuing some sort of foolishness.

97
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:04,071
And I always let you talk me out of it.
But not this time.

98
00:10:05,156 --> 00:10:10,203
Thor, where are you going
that you need such a weapon?

99
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,749
Are you aware that there was
a test of manhood for young warriors?

100
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,417
A secret quest.

101
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,085
Yes, I know of it.

102
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:23,216
It's a rite of passage.
Warriors pursue it every year. No one dies.

103
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:26,552
Because the object of the quest
will never be found.

104
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:29,764
The test is not
in finding the Sword of Surtur

105
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:30,973
but in looking for it.

106
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:34,936
So, it is the art of trespassing you aspire to.

107
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:38,022
Yes, it is. When it's in Jštunheim.

108
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:43,402
Thor, our truce with the Frost Giants
is fragile at best.

109
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:45,780
They must not find you in their realm.

110
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:50,243
They won't.
You think too highly of those lumbering...

111
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:54,664
Forgive me, Algrim.
That was thoughtless of me.

112
00:10:55,706 --> 00:10:57,500
Rest easy, Thor.

113
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,464
But, if nothing else,
let my people's fate serve as an example.

114
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:06,217
The Frost Giants are dangerous.

115
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:10,513
I know. I promise to be vigilant. And, Algrim,

116
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:13,266
as always, this stays between us.

117
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:17,854
I will remain silent for as long as possible.

118
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:20,523
Thank you. You are a good friend.

119
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,751
I'm doing it.

120
00:11:41,627 --> 00:11:43,713
Now try your hand at influencing it.

121
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,299
Keep it to three words.

122
00:11:54,724 --> 00:12:00,897
A spell's power is in its whisper.
A true master needs only to think it.

123
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:16,662
You find humor in this?

124
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:22,293
Loki, you granted magic to water.
It became a snake, and a snake bites.

125
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,295
You did it perfectly.

126
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:25,505
I did?

127
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:28,049
Don't you know how amazing you are?

128
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:32,470
Metal and rock are easy,
but to have an apprentice control water,

129
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:37,600
it's a triple threat, for it is also mist and ice.

130
00:12:38,768 --> 00:12:40,228
Amora.

131
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,274
Leave us.

132
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,860
Yes, Your Highness.

133
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:53,950
Do you need something, Brother?

134
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,869
Yes. How is your magic?

135
00:12:57,203 --> 00:12:59,664
It happens to be fairly advanced. Why?

136
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:02,458
<i>Because we're stealing aboard
the Thunder Runner,</i>

137
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,585
and we'll need your talents on our journey.

138
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:07,713
I lied. I'm not very good.

139
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:24,146
This is it.
We'll conceal ourselves in the hold.

140
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,899
Conceal ourselves? From our friends?

141
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:28,901
Friends who are not foolhardy enough

142
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:31,696
to set sail with the sons of Odin
on their vessel.

143
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:34,574
- Now make haste before...
- A mere seven days,

144
00:13:34,657 --> 00:13:38,578
though it will feel like an eternity
while in the throes of battle

145
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:40,746
against the beasts of Jštunheim.

146
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:43,416
Bring us something, won't you?

147
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:48,337
Perhaps a claw or fang
of a savage white bear would please you.

148
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,124
It's astonishing, Loki.

149
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,710
This is a view of Asgard
like we've never seen.

150
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,296
And one I never cared to see.

151
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:31,756
You always fret.

152
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:34,258
The Warriors Three have
returned from this adventure

153
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:36,969
for the last three seasons
with nary a scratch.

154
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:41,390
But we're royalty.
We're not equipped to handle adventure.

155
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:45,686
Fear not, little brother,
for I am a skilled hand with a blade.

156
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,438
I'll protect you.

157
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:51,734
Sif was right. I've done him no favors.

158
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,741
Algrim?

159
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,162
Sire? Is there trouble?

160
00:15:03,496 --> 00:15:07,375
No. I'm just looking for my sons.
Have you seen them?

161
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:10,127
Not for hours, my lord.

162
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:14,131
But it is not uncommon for them to be away
from their chambers at this time of night.

163
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:18,427
Sire, have you found
a reason to be concerned?

164
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:21,556
Thor and I had an argument.

165
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,811
Quarrels are to be expected.
He is nearing the age of adulthood.

166
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:28,771
Yes, nearing.

167
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,358
He has yet to arrive,
despite what he believes.

168
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:34,610
I'm afraid he may have
done something foolish.

169
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:37,864
You would think
that someone known as the "All Father"

170
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:41,492
should possess the wisdom
to raise two boys.

171
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:44,704
They are not your average boys, Sire.

172
00:15:45,413 --> 00:15:50,793
Algrim, am I a good father?
Do I shield them from too much?

173
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,422
Though my children never had the chance

174
00:15:55,631 --> 00:15:57,175
to come of age,

175
00:15:57,925 --> 00:16:01,095
I do believe that keeping sons too close

176
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:04,265
could very well be what drives them away.

177
00:16:05,474 --> 00:16:10,897
Some lessons, my lord,
can only be learned with real consequences.

178
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:14,984
So, perhaps that is what
you can teach them now.

179
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:22,450
Your counsel is wise, Algrim.
And, as always, appreciated.

180
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,755
Loki, wake up.

181
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,465
What?

182
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,133
The ship lies still.

183
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:41,344
We're in Jötunheim.

184
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:49,435
Come back, and I'll kill you!

185
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:52,813
It's smaller than I imagined.

186
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,593
Say, love, do you know where
a gallant warrior like myself

187
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:26,472
might purchase the claw or fang
of a savage white bear?

188
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:34,897
Another round.

189
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:41,988
Going after Nixies now, are you Fandral?

190
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:43,823
Having established your standards,

191
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:47,618
let's maybe try your hand at a nice,
plump hobgoblin girl.

192
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:52,540
You jest, but in the later hours, who knows?

193
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:58,421
Change that grim face, Hogun,
or we'll make you go sit with the Greeks.

194
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:03,843
Spending a half fortnight
in this rotting armpit,

195
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:07,013
merely to steal stories, has lost its charm.

196
00:18:07,388 --> 00:18:10,516
What hasn't lost its charm for you, Hogun?

197
00:18:21,986 --> 00:18:23,571
I believe I'll go turn in.

198
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,623
We're about to get a new story.

199
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:36,709
I'll secure us a little roasted
mystery meat, boys,

200
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:39,504
while you two spread out
and see what can be overheard.

201
00:18:39,587 --> 00:18:41,506
Do you know the one about
the three explorers

202
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:44,884
whose travels never took them
beyond an outpost inn?

203
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:48,513
Hello, friends.

204
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:56,729
Sire, what brings you
this far from the kingdom?

205
00:18:56,938 --> 00:19:00,733
<i>A drafty little bucket
named the Thunder Runner. Know of it?</i>

206
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,778
You stowed away?

207
00:19:03,903 --> 00:19:05,655
Upon our vessel?

208
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:07,698
It gets worse.

209
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:11,953
And you brought Loki.

210
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:14,705
We'll all be drawn and quartered.

211
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:21,420
Relax. Lift your steins for a toast, lads.

212
00:19:21,504 --> 00:19:24,090
To frigid worlds and lost swords.

213
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:27,677
You took my ale.

214
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:32,473
You dare lay your foul-smelling paw
on the son of Odin?

215
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:37,603
Stay your hands!

216
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:46,404
Fenris.

217
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:57,039
And I thought his paw was foul-smelling.

218
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:29,447
Enough!

219
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:39,665
Barkeep, some fiend is making off
with your cash box.

220
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:48,174
Excuse me!

221
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,762
Who started it?

222
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:54,597
Does it ever matter?

223
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:18,830
- Have you seen my sword?
- No.

224
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,207
Let's look for it.

225
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:47,024
Greetings, ladies. Perhaps later we can...

226
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:55,366
Have you seen a sword?
Gold, bejeweled, perfectly balanced?

227
00:22:00,663 --> 00:22:02,415
Here, try this.

228
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:06,919
Well, it's better than nothing.

229
00:22:17,763 --> 00:22:20,641
Did you use a little... You know.

230
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:22,226
No.

231
00:22:29,942 --> 00:22:31,611
You're mine!

232
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:48,336
That just breaks the heart.

233
00:22:49,754 --> 00:22:51,672
Come on, come on, come on.

234
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:22,453
Well, lads, I'd say
that's enough adventure for one trip.

235
00:23:22,578 --> 00:23:23,538
Agreed.

236
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:26,916
Then let's put about ship
and head for home.

237
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,126
With charitable winds,
we can be there by morning.

238
00:23:29,544 --> 00:23:31,045
Nay, friends.

239
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,173
We came in search of Surtur's sword,

240
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:37,260
and we'll not return home until we find it.

241
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:42,265
You heard my brother. On to Jötunheim.

242
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:03,995
While I commend your aim, novice,

243
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:07,790
it is evident that
one man has claim on your focus.

244
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,961
My apologies, Brunhilde.

245
00:24:12,503 --> 00:24:14,046
No need to apologize.

246
00:24:14,672 --> 00:24:17,508
We've all joined the sisterhood
for similar reasons.

247
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:21,012
But this is Konurlifandi,

248
00:24:21,888 --> 00:24:24,682
a place where we sever our reliance on men.

249
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:29,520
Where we are free to
reach our true potential.

250
00:24:29,604 --> 00:24:31,981
Yes, ma'am. 'Tis why I've come here.

251
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:34,734
Then I offer this advice, Sif.

252
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:38,446
Men are useful for one reason
and one reason only.

253
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:41,073
Beyond that, they should be disposed of.

254
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:43,659
Now return to the line.

255
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:09,352
I have to say, I'm close to weeping, lads.

256
00:25:09,477 --> 00:25:14,899
Aye. She was far from pretty,
but she did perform her duty well.

257
00:25:15,024 --> 00:25:17,360
A quality I've grown to appreciate.

258
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:21,405
Gentlemen, why linger?
We have nowhere to go but onward.

259
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:45,596
How can you whistle? My lips are frozen.

260
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:49,642
I've never felt such cold in my life,

261
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:52,478
yet you walk as if
crossing the spring meadow.

262
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:55,273
There must be but one explanation.

263
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:57,024
I'm tougher than you.

264
00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:01,737
Fine. Then I'll let you fend off
the first Frost Giant, little brother.

265
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,034
Stand guard. I sense movement.

266
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:27,096
Snow sprites. What would we do
without your keen senses, Hogun?

267
00:26:32,727 --> 00:26:35,521
Hey! Thieving little pest!

268
00:26:36,022 --> 00:26:39,984
Keep alert, friends!
Surtur's sword won't be looking for us.

269
00:27:18,523 --> 00:27:19,649
Thor?

270
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:30,743
You're not giving up, are you, Brother?

271
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:32,537
I fear Algrim's right.

272
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,122
- About what?
- The sword.

273
00:27:35,248 --> 00:27:37,250
He said it will never be found.

274
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,168
What does Algrim know of it?

275
00:27:39,627 --> 00:27:44,340
He knows Jötunheim well, Loki.
It claimed his people.

276
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:46,551
It wiped them out as if they never existed.

277
00:27:46,676 --> 00:27:49,804
Nay, it was
the Frost Giants who claimed them.

278
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:52,223
The land itself is not to blame.

279
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:56,352
It matters not.
We hold no kinship with the ice.

280
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:58,855
Therefore, its secrets are safe from us.

281
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,566
Every secret has its clues.

282
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:05,778
Do you recall the many tales of valor

283
00:28:05,903 --> 00:28:08,406
we were forced to commit to memory
as children?

284
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:10,575
Yes. I love those stories.

285
00:28:11,117 --> 00:28:14,662
Verily. I can recite
Odin's great defeat of Surtur by heart.

286
00:28:14,996 --> 00:28:16,330
I, as well.

287
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,922
Then you should recognize this valley.
'Tis where that defeat took place.

288
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:29,385
Yes. Yes, I see it. It began there.

289
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:35,725
<i>Father held the only weapon
that could rival Surtur's sword,</i>

290
00:28:36,142 --> 00:28:38,269
<i>his spear, Gungnir.</i>

291
00:28:44,775 --> 00:28:46,944
<i>Yet he bided his time.</i>

292
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:54,327
A wise warrior, Father knew
his only hope was to tire the fire giant first.

293
00:28:54,452 --> 00:28:58,080
<i>So exhausted was Surtur,
that to lift his sword,</i>

294
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,833
he needed both hands.

295
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:03,002
- Thus exposing his chest.
- Thus exposing his chest.

296
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:20,228
It must be there,
at the foot of that mountain.

297
00:29:44,752 --> 00:29:47,839
I cannot take another step.

298
00:29:51,717 --> 00:29:53,970
Stand guard. I hear something.

299
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,184
What this time, Hogun? A moth? A cricket?
Perhaps a...

300
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:02,270
Don't move.

301
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:23,583
Enter.

302
00:30:27,795 --> 00:30:31,924
Sire, a visitor from the outer realm
seeks an audience.

303
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:34,635
You manage affairs today, Algrim.

304
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:39,432
I have been,
but this concerns Thor and Loki.

305
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:40,808
Show him in.

306
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:51,402
What news do you bring?

307
00:30:52,028 --> 00:30:57,867
News? I've come for compensation.
My dwelling was destroyed!

308
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,119
And for what reason
do you seek payment here?

309
00:31:00,578 --> 00:31:03,414
Because the sons of Odin were responsible!

310
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:08,211
One of them left this!

311
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:38,157
Brother, over there.

312
00:31:50,878 --> 00:31:52,672
It's magnificent.

313
00:31:52,797 --> 00:31:55,299
And large. Very large!

314
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:57,844
Who of us knew it would be that large?

315
00:31:57,969 --> 00:31:59,136
Not me.

316
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,805
I'm very surprised.

317
00:32:00,888 --> 00:32:03,057
The dwarves called it Elderstahl.

318
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:06,936
They fashioned it to
fit the hand of whoever wields it.

319
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:09,355
Hogun, can you break it free?

320
00:32:09,897 --> 00:32:12,733
Aye. Stand back.

321
00:33:29,101 --> 00:33:30,353
Brother?

322
00:33:30,478 --> 00:33:32,563
I've never felt such power.

323
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:36,275
This has moved beyond a harmless quest.

324
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,278
We must not be found in Jötunheim
with such a weapon.

325
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:43,950
Why be concerned, Loki?
I defy anyone to confront us,

326
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:46,786
especially now that we are armed with this.

327
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:19,777
We must return to Asgard with due haste.

328
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:23,489
Agreed, but for that,
we must first make our way north.

329
00:34:24,365 --> 00:34:25,491
North?

331
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:30,830
We need a new means of travel,
so we'll acquire horses in Konurlifandi.

332
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:32,874
From the Valkyries?

333
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:36,085
We'd be lucky to leave with our lives,
let alone horses.

334
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,503
They'll never help us.

335
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,756
They won't, but Sif will.

336
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:43,926
So, it's Sif that lures you there.

337
00:34:45,928 --> 00:34:47,013
No, Loki.

338
00:34:47,305 --> 00:34:50,141
I'm just attempting to get us home.
That's all.

339
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:55,980
Hear that?
We're heading to the Valkyrie training camp.

340
00:34:57,356 --> 00:35:00,610
And passing from
one frigid world to another.

341
00:35:01,152 --> 00:35:07,533
Fandral, just how many of their
maiden warriors have you angered?

342
00:35:08,326 --> 00:35:11,537
Let's just say
I bear an unsettling resemblance

343
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:14,123
to their archery targets.

344
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:36,437
We have intruders!

345
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:06,175
They have the scent. Let's go!

346
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:26,571
Get down.

347
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,908
Look there.

348
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,913
Sentries. We must find
another means of crossing.

349
00:36:36,164 --> 00:36:40,585
You remember the realm charts as well as I.
This is the only northern route.

350
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:44,630
We've other trouble. There.

351
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:51,804
Brother, they sleep.

352
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:53,723
We can just steal past.

353
00:36:54,682 --> 00:36:55,683
Let's go.

354
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:29,258
Intruders!

355
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:33,304
Stop the intruders!

356
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:39,393
Run!

357
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:48,361
Loki!

358
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,783
Stay back!

359
00:37:56,744 --> 00:38:00,623
We are Odin's sons,
heirs to the throne of Asgard.

360
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:02,792
We mean you no harm.

361
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:05,044
Just let us pass.

362
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:10,466
Go, go, go!

363
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:13,845
They come again!

364
00:38:15,012 --> 00:38:16,764
I said stay back!

365
00:38:31,654 --> 00:38:32,697
No!

366
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,387
I did not mean for that to happen.

367
00:38:58,431 --> 00:39:02,101
I know, Brother, but we must go.

368
00:39:09,525 --> 00:39:11,277
Inform the king at once.

369
00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:29,337
Thor.

370
00:39:29,462 --> 00:39:30,505
Say nothing, Loki.

371
00:39:31,255 --> 00:39:35,468
It was not your fault.
Those beasts attacked us.

372
00:39:36,093 --> 00:39:37,970
We were the trespassers, Loki!

373
00:39:38,346 --> 00:39:42,725
They were in the right, and now,
two Frost Giants have died by my hand!

374
00:39:54,278 --> 00:39:55,738
What is your report?

375
00:39:56,113 --> 00:39:59,700
Your Majesty, Elderstahl has been found.

376
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:01,994
By whom?

377
00:40:02,328 --> 00:40:03,913
The sons of Odin,

378
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:07,208
and they killed two sentries
escaping to the North.

379
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:10,670
Father?

380
00:40:14,465 --> 00:40:19,512
Prepare my army.
We march on Asgard this day.

381
00:40:43,244 --> 00:40:45,663
He should not be going in alone.

382
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:47,456
No man should go in there alone.

383
00:40:47,707 --> 00:40:49,125
No man should go in there at all!

384
00:41:18,988 --> 00:41:20,072
Sif.

385
00:41:23,534 --> 00:41:24,994
No! Wait!

386
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:27,079
What madness brings you here?

387
00:41:27,413 --> 00:41:29,874
I need you.

388
00:41:32,877 --> 00:41:33,878
You what?

389
00:41:34,754 --> 00:41:38,090
I need you to secure five horses for me.

390
00:41:41,844 --> 00:41:44,096
I've no time for your hostility, Sif.

391
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:46,557
I just require your help.

392
00:41:47,433 --> 00:41:50,353
No. I came here to get away from you.

393
00:41:50,728 --> 00:41:52,605
Now leave before you're discovered.

394
00:41:52,688 --> 00:41:55,650
Listen to me. I've just come from Jötunheim.

395
00:41:55,733 --> 00:41:58,611
Terrible things have happened.
I must get home.

396
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,030
Why would you go to Jötunheim?

397
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:03,866
To find this.

398
00:42:08,246 --> 00:42:10,081
The Sword of Surtur.

399
00:42:13,668 --> 00:42:15,795
Now, please, will you help me?

400
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,467
On your knees, male!

401
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,681
Or die where you stand.

402
00:42:39,694 --> 00:42:41,571
There is a chill in the air.

403
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:45,032
A familiar one.

404
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,661
I'll prepare your chariot, my lord.

405
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:41,881
Geirmarr, I seek an audience
with your father.

406
00:43:42,173 --> 00:43:43,883
You may speak to me.

407
00:43:44,342 --> 00:43:47,637
Then I will state it simply for your benefit.

408
00:43:48,012 --> 00:43:50,932
You violate our peace accord
by your presence here.

409
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:55,895
We no longer have an accord.
Thor made positive of that.

410
00:43:57,188 --> 00:44:00,274
King Thrym, was our truce so tenuous

411
00:44:00,399 --> 00:44:03,569
that it could be broken
by a youth's careless trespass?

412
00:44:03,694 --> 00:44:05,404
Careless trespass?

413
00:44:06,697 --> 00:44:09,951
He took up Elderstahl
and slew two Northern sentries!

414
00:44:10,076 --> 00:44:11,035
He what?

415
00:44:20,878 --> 00:44:23,798
Odin, you knew not of this?

416
00:44:24,632 --> 00:44:25,591
No.

417
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,220
I'm afraid it changes nothing.

418
00:44:29,762 --> 00:44:34,100
By his actions,
Thor has declared war on Jötunheim.

419
00:44:39,522 --> 00:44:43,568
Your Eminence, what do you seek
in return for averting this war?

420
00:44:53,953 --> 00:44:57,456
All Father, the Frost Giants
continue gathering in the valley.

421
00:44:57,665 --> 00:44:59,584
They await the meeting of their terms.

422
00:44:59,667 --> 00:45:00,793
Which are?

423
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:04,630
I have until sunrise
to turn over the Sword of Surtur.

424
00:45:05,798 --> 00:45:07,008
He found it?

425
00:45:07,258 --> 00:45:11,637
Yes, and it was used to kill
two Frost sentries in the North.

426
00:45:12,388 --> 00:45:15,850
Sire, we must find them
before the Jštuns do.

427
00:45:15,933 --> 00:45:18,311
With your permission,
I will accompany the Einherjar

428
00:45:18,394 --> 00:45:20,438
to escort them home.

429
00:45:20,813 --> 00:45:23,441
How would you know where to look?
They could be anywhere.

430
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:27,612
The slayings took place in the North,

431
00:45:27,695 --> 00:45:31,073
where the only sentries would be
posted here at this bridge.

432
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,244
If they crossed over, the route to Asgard
would take them through Svartalfheim.

433
00:45:36,287 --> 00:45:38,164
You would be willing to go back there?

434
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:40,875
To save your sons, yes.

435
00:45:42,126 --> 00:45:46,005
Your selfless actions
will not go unrewarded, Algrim.

436
00:45:46,506 --> 00:45:47,798
Thank you.

437
00:46:08,903 --> 00:46:11,489
Hear me well, Odin's son.

438
00:46:11,572 --> 00:46:15,368
Asgard has made a grave error
in sending you here.

439
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:19,455
The error is yours, Brunhilde,
for I did not come alone.

440
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:24,252
You might as well have.

441
00:46:29,465 --> 00:46:33,427
Hildie, my love,
why don't we end this silliness...

442
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:35,346
Silence, male!

443
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:39,350
You will all suffer the same fate
as Odin's last spy.

444
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:48,860
Do you honestly believe
the prince of Asgard is here to spy?

445
00:46:53,948 --> 00:46:57,034
What I believe is that you have come
to exert your dominance

446
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,787
over the female who fled your embrace.

447
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,874
I came for horses. That's all.

448
00:47:02,957 --> 00:47:05,793
Please release us.
We must return to Asgard.

449
00:47:06,002 --> 00:47:08,838
You mean, escape to Asgard.

450
00:47:09,297 --> 00:47:10,840
I know of your thievery.

451
00:47:11,132 --> 00:47:13,634
How you wish to deliver
the fire sword to Odin

452
00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:17,597
so that he can further subjugate those
who might rise against him.

453
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,225
I am all that keeps that weapon
from falling into the wrong hands!

454
00:47:21,517 --> 00:47:24,395
Who are you to judge a hand's worthiness?

455
00:47:25,229 --> 00:47:28,483
Perhaps its rightful place is in mine.

456
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:34,572
Attention, wenches!

457
00:47:34,864 --> 00:47:37,450
You will release your prisoners now.

458
00:47:51,255 --> 00:47:56,260
Loki, your brother currently enjoys
his final breaths of life

459
00:47:56,844 --> 00:47:59,472
unless you sheath that weapon.

460
00:48:00,515 --> 00:48:04,352
Loki, do it.
The fire sword must not be used again.

461
00:48:06,771 --> 00:48:08,314
Hand it to me.

462
00:48:22,745 --> 00:48:24,455
Prepare them for execution.

463
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:25,540
No!

464
00:48:25,873 --> 00:48:29,126
Hold your tongue, Sif, or you will join them.

465
00:48:30,336 --> 00:48:32,213
What manner of witchery is this?

466
00:48:32,797 --> 00:48:33,923
Frost Giants!

467
00:48:38,928 --> 00:48:41,639
Slay them all and recover the sword!

468
00:49:05,955 --> 00:49:07,665
Hello? Anyone?

469
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:10,209
Someone get us down!

470
00:49:23,181 --> 00:49:24,140
Hey!

471
00:49:56,464 --> 00:50:00,009
Murderer. Now you die!

472
00:50:30,623 --> 00:50:33,084
Now, quickly, help me get these fangs.

473
00:50:57,817 --> 00:50:59,485
Give them no quarter, lads!

474
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:01,028
Stop.

475
00:51:02,405 --> 00:51:03,364
But the giants!

476
00:51:03,739 --> 00:51:07,618
It's just like men to assume
we need their protection.

477
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:08,953
Take this and go.

478
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,875
Sif, provide them with horses
and escort them back to Asgard.

479
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,334
Yes, my lady.

480
00:51:15,543 --> 00:51:16,836
And, Sif,

481
00:51:17,753 --> 00:51:21,048
only return to us when you are truly ready.

482
00:51:47,867 --> 00:51:50,411
Why does nothing grow in this place?

483
00:51:50,536 --> 00:51:53,623
It was a final gift from King Thrym.

484
00:51:53,956 --> 00:51:57,293
But I thought your war with the Frost Giants
ended in Jötunheim.

485
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,714
The war ended there, but the killing did not.

486
00:52:02,256 --> 00:52:05,301
They set glaciers in motion across the land,

487
00:52:05,551 --> 00:52:08,679
grinding away any hope
that life might ever return here.

488
00:52:09,222 --> 00:52:14,811
Counselor, I realize this is difficult,
but we've been charged with a mission.

489
00:52:17,104 --> 00:52:19,398
Of course. Forgive me.

490
00:52:20,399 --> 00:52:23,778
The children cannot cross this dead world
without water,

491
00:52:23,903 --> 00:52:26,113
and the only source of it lies just ahead.

492
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,784
If they're here, that's where we'll find them.

493
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:47,051
Search the area.

494
00:52:56,769 --> 00:52:59,188
Ander, you're slipping.

495
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:03,943
Your Highness, rest assured.
It won't happen again.

496
00:53:04,402 --> 00:53:08,406
And to think the four of us didn't qualify
to train with the Einherjar.

497
00:53:10,825 --> 00:53:13,369
Thor, Loki, it's good to see you.

498
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:17,456
Algrim, never have I seen a friendlier face.

499
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,292
How did you know to come for us here?

500
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,502
From the Frost Giants.

501
00:53:21,627 --> 00:53:24,839
They have amassed in Asgard
and threaten war.

502
00:53:25,256 --> 00:53:28,384
They... You mean, because of me.

503
00:53:28,885 --> 00:53:32,471
It was an accident, Algrim.
There was no malice intended.

504
00:53:32,889 --> 00:53:36,267
Malice or not, they now demand the sword
as recompense.

505
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:45,735
No, this weapon is a seeker of death!
We cannot just hand it over!

506
00:53:46,152 --> 00:53:49,947
Your father agrees with you.
That's why he sent us.

507
00:53:50,031 --> 00:53:54,076
Thor, you've carried
this burden long enough.

508
00:53:54,202 --> 00:53:55,953
Allow me to take it from you.

509
00:53:56,329 --> 00:53:59,624
Gladly. It is pure evil.

510
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:11,552
No. It is the Frost Giants who are evil.

511
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:17,141
The pain, the persecution, the enslavement.

512
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:20,895
The eternal suffering
they caused my people.

513
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,481
There was no end to their cruelty.

514
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,399
Algrim?

515
00:54:25,525 --> 00:54:29,403
And though this weapon
has caused you much grief,

516
00:54:29,529 --> 00:54:32,949
there was a time when it offered great hope.

517
00:54:33,074 --> 00:54:35,034
A promise of freedom.

518
00:54:35,326 --> 00:54:39,330
This place haunts you, Algrim. We must go.

519
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:43,626
Did Odin ever tell you that
we came to him first?

520
00:54:43,751 --> 00:54:48,005
That we asked for help
in our war against the Frost Giants?

521
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:49,674
But he refused!

522
00:54:49,924 --> 00:54:55,096
We were forced to turn to
Surtur and this sword for our very survival.

523
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,101
Only then did your father join the war.
Against us!

524
00:55:02,061 --> 00:55:06,274
He struck Surtur down
and sealed the fate of my people!

525
00:55:06,524 --> 00:55:07,483
Algrim!

526
00:55:07,608 --> 00:55:10,736
Now I understand why I was spared.

527
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:15,658
To avenge the dark elves.
To deliver judgment!

528
00:55:19,287 --> 00:55:20,288
No!

529
00:55:52,403 --> 00:55:57,950
If you return home,
I'll bury you in the ashes of Asgard!

530
00:56:08,836 --> 00:56:10,296
What do we do?

531
00:56:18,638 --> 00:56:22,558
We track down the horses
and then find a way to stop him.

532
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:49,502
Odin's dark elf.

533
00:56:50,795 --> 00:56:52,421
He carries Elderstahl.

534
00:56:53,422 --> 00:56:55,591
We should seize it now
before he reaches safety.

535
00:56:55,925 --> 00:56:58,845
I gave Odin until sunrise.

536
00:56:59,095 --> 00:57:00,513
We will wait.

537
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:11,649
Algrim.

538
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:18,865
Here, Sire!

539
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:30,877
Why?

540
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:35,381
You more than anyone should know why.

541
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:39,302
You still hold me responsible
for the fate of your race?

542
00:57:48,019 --> 00:57:50,563
You could have defeated the Frost Giants!

543
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:54,609
No. That war could not have been won,

544
00:57:54,817 --> 00:57:58,488
even if I had sacrificed every life in Asgard.

545
00:57:59,113 --> 00:58:00,198
You lie!

546
00:58:16,172 --> 00:58:18,090
We found a way to win!

547
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:23,930
Surtur. He was no savior. He was a demon!

548
00:58:24,263 --> 00:58:28,601
He aligned himself
with you only to conquer Jötunheim.

549
00:58:28,726 --> 00:58:31,270
But he would not have stopped there.

550
00:58:49,622 --> 00:58:54,085
By bringing him into your fight,
you risked all the nine realms.

551
00:58:54,377 --> 00:58:57,421
Easy to say when your people still live!

552
00:59:20,528 --> 00:59:24,699
The sun rises, Father,
and Odin still possesses Elderstahl.

553
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:32,707
Begin.

554
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:43,050
Return fire!

555
00:59:45,469 --> 00:59:46,929
Release!

556
01:00:23,508 --> 01:00:24,550
We're too late.

557
01:00:31,015 --> 01:00:33,893
Sif, Warriors Three,
you must help hold the line.

558
01:00:34,227 --> 01:00:36,187
Loki and I will save our father.

559
01:01:05,007 --> 01:01:08,177
Be honest. You can fight, can't you?

560
01:01:08,261 --> 01:01:10,555
Of course.
Have we never told you of the time...

561
01:01:10,638 --> 01:01:13,391
Can you fight?

562
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,644
Yes, if we must.

563
01:01:34,036 --> 01:01:37,915
Algrim, you will gain nothing from this.

564
01:01:41,169 --> 01:01:45,631
It's enough that
the war you avoided is upon you,

565
01:01:45,756 --> 01:01:51,762
and these walls which you protected
at the cost of my people will crumble!

566
01:02:04,609 --> 01:02:07,820
That sword has taken its last life, Algrim.

567
01:02:08,112 --> 01:02:12,492
Not as long as
the House of Odin still stands.

568
01:02:16,621 --> 01:02:17,997
Father.

569
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:22,335
Please, please, hold on.

570
01:03:41,873 --> 01:03:44,500
I cannot forgive this betrayal, Algrim.

571
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:53,759
But I cannot forget
the many years you were my friend

572
01:03:54,051 --> 01:03:55,803
and my family.

573
01:03:57,138 --> 01:03:59,390
Monster!

574
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,120
Brother, it's all right.

575
01:04:21,704 --> 01:04:23,331
It's all right.

576
01:04:37,428 --> 01:04:39,138
Stay with Father.

577
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:07,333
Your Eminence, I am Thor, son of Odin.

578
01:05:08,793 --> 01:05:10,753
I humbly return Elderstahl to you

579
01:05:10,837 --> 01:05:14,757
and offer myself as your prisoner
in hopes of ending this conflict.

580
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,850
Kill him.

581
01:05:26,811 --> 01:05:27,979
Wait.

582
01:05:28,229 --> 01:05:29,522
Where is Odin?

583
01:05:29,939 --> 01:05:33,985
Algrim, the dark elf, betrayed us.
My father lies dying.

584
01:05:34,527 --> 01:05:35,653
And the dark elf?

585
01:05:36,112 --> 01:05:38,781
He is dead, slain by my brother.

586
01:05:42,493 --> 01:05:45,872
I warned your father against
giving him sanctuary.

587
01:05:50,668 --> 01:05:53,171
There are many who seek this weapon,

588
01:05:53,296 --> 01:05:57,717
for with it, even the weak can
rise up against Jötunheim.

589
01:05:58,593 --> 01:06:00,553
So I accept your peace offering.

590
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:04,557
The war ends.

591
01:06:06,476 --> 01:06:10,521
Father, we are on the cusp of victory.

592
01:06:11,564 --> 01:06:15,234
Do not underestimate
the might of this kingdom, Geirmarr.

593
01:06:16,027 --> 01:06:19,489
Besides, we have what we came for.

594
01:06:22,909 --> 01:06:24,243
And what of my fate?

595
01:06:27,413 --> 01:06:30,208
Two Jštuns died by your hand.

596
01:06:34,295 --> 01:06:39,091
But you have saved countless others
by returning this weapon to us.

597
01:06:42,094 --> 01:06:46,849
Now go. Tend to your father, son of Odin.

598
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:21,384
Loki.

599
01:07:27,223 --> 01:07:29,350
You've been hiding in this temple
long enough.

600
01:07:31,352 --> 01:07:34,397
I'm not hiding. I like it here.

601
01:07:36,816 --> 01:07:38,860
I know you lament your actions,

602
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:42,446
but you did what you thought was right
to save us.

603
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:45,449
No, I sought vengeance.

604
01:07:47,994 --> 01:07:50,496
Thor, I am convinced that,

605
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:53,374
in Algrim's place,
I would have acted no differently.

606
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:58,421
Who of us knows what we're capable of
when family is threatened?

607
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:03,509
Hopefully, we'll never again be
faced with such choices.

608
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:07,680
I'm going to see Father. Will you join me?

609
01:08:08,473 --> 01:08:10,183
I will.

610
01:08:11,517 --> 01:08:12,643
Later.

611
01:08:23,196 --> 01:08:25,281
Are you up for a visitor?

612
01:08:25,364 --> 01:08:27,074
Of course. Come in.

613
01:08:30,077 --> 01:08:31,245
How is your brother?

614
01:08:31,662 --> 01:08:32,663
He'll be fine.

615
01:08:33,372 --> 01:08:34,540
And you?

616
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:36,542
I will be fine, as well.

617
01:08:37,585 --> 01:08:39,670
I imagine much is on your mind.

618
01:08:40,213 --> 01:08:42,798
Father, I should have listened to you.

619
01:08:43,841 --> 01:08:46,302
I was just so eager to prove myself.

620
01:08:46,886 --> 01:08:48,679
And I should have listened to you.

621
01:08:49,305 --> 01:08:50,306
Why?

622
01:08:51,057 --> 01:08:54,811
You came to me as a man,
seeking to test your mettle.

623
01:08:55,728 --> 01:08:57,688
I saw only a boy.

624
01:08:57,814 --> 01:08:59,065
Because I was.

625
01:08:59,565 --> 01:09:02,819
Father, due to my heedless actions,
I ignited a war.

626
01:09:02,902 --> 01:09:08,074
Yes, you did,
and you saw what little it takes.

627
01:09:08,866 --> 01:09:11,369
But then you also saw the value of peace,

628
01:09:11,577 --> 01:09:15,540
even when its cost can be so very great.

629
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:19,001
Such wisdom took me ages to learn.

630
01:09:19,836 --> 01:09:24,549
Son, never has the House of Odin
stood on firmer ground

631
01:09:24,757 --> 01:09:26,175
or been more revered.

632
01:09:26,843 --> 01:09:28,803
You have done this kingdom proud.

633
01:09:36,644 --> 01:09:39,939
We hadn't even gotten to Jötunheim
when our troubles began.

634
01:09:40,064 --> 01:09:42,942
Stopping for a little repast
at an outland pub,

635
01:09:43,192 --> 01:09:49,448
we found ourselves surrounded by
the most vile beasts of all the nine realms.

636
01:09:50,449 --> 01:09:51,742
White bears?

637
01:09:51,826 --> 01:09:53,161
Wolves, love.

638
01:09:53,327 --> 01:09:58,833
These fiends eat white bears for breakfast,
as do I.

639
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:01,210
How many were after you?

640
01:10:02,044 --> 01:10:03,546
- Seven.
- Ten.

641
01:10:03,629 --> 01:10:05,006
Thirty-four.

642
01:10:08,176 --> 01:10:11,679
Lads, have I caught you
filling their ears with lies again?

643
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:15,183
Well, it was the dead of night after all.

644
01:10:15,308 --> 01:10:17,560
With nary a torch lit.

645
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,480
Because I'm certain I counted at least 50.

646
01:10:21,814 --> 01:10:27,695
He's right. Fifty. Fortunately,
I knew the art of disemboweling.

647
01:10:27,862 --> 01:10:31,741
They attacked with matted fur
and dripping fangs,

648
01:10:31,824 --> 01:10:34,702
intent on feasting on Asgardian meat!

649
01:10:34,827 --> 01:10:37,788
So, naturally, they went after Volstagg first.

650
01:10:46,464 --> 01:10:49,509
I understand your father
continues to gain his strength.

651
01:10:49,634 --> 01:10:52,345
He does, with new scars added to old.

652
01:10:52,637 --> 01:10:54,931
Good. I am happy to hear that.

653
01:10:56,390 --> 01:11:00,353
And what's this I hear about you being
recruited to train with the new Einherjar?

654
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,855
As if you didn't have
anything to do with that.

655
01:11:03,231 --> 01:11:07,235
No, you've proven your worth.
Your acceptance was your doing.

656
01:11:08,277 --> 01:11:10,696
Although, I am pleased
it's no longer a mere maiden

657
01:11:10,822 --> 01:11:12,824
that bested me with a barn tool.

658
01:11:13,115 --> 01:11:14,575
Care for a rematch?

659
01:11:14,826 --> 01:11:16,202
Absolutely.
