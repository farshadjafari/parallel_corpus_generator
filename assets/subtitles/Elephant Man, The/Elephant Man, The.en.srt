1
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,212
No Entry

2
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,334
The fruit of Original Sin

3
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,131
Away with it!
- Don't be difficult!

4
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,697
Let's take
our lovely children on an outing!

5
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,538
You can't do this. I know my rights.

6
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,335
I have the authority
to close you down.

7
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,455
This exhibit degrades those who see it
and the poor creature himself.

8
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,336
He is a freak. How else will he live?

9
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,175
This is entirely different!

10
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,418
This is montrous
and should not be allowed!

11
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,411
These officers will see
that you are on your way. Good day!

12
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,014
Move along please!

13
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,010
Hold it there, sir. Come this way.

14
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,615
On the move again...

15
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,812
My treasure.

16
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,538
We're seeing a lot more
of these machine accidents.

17
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,772
Abominable things these machines.
You can't reason with them.

18
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,014
What a mess.

19
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,816
Pull on the rope!

20
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,776
Irons, please!

21
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,374
Who is it?

22
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,732
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, what is it?

23
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,536
I found it.
- Good. Did you see it?

24
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,140
No.
- Alright.

25
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,855
I'll see you in a moment. Thank you.

26
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,498
Who's that?
- A friend of mine.

27
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,695
Oh yes?

28
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,938
What are you up to?
- Nothing.

29
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,495
Oh, come on!

30
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,771
Nothing of any importance.

31
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,218
Where's Green Street, please?

32
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,211
Second on the left, then right.
- Thanks.

33
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,574
Are you the proprietor?
- And who might you be, sir?

34
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,410
Just one of the curious.
I'd like to see it.

35
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,015
I don't think so, we're...

36
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,209
closed!
- I'd pay handsomely for a showing.

37
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,458
Are you the proprietor?
- Handsomely?. Who sent you?

38
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,016
I beg your pardon?
- Never mind.

39
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,738
I'm the owner.

40
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,009
Life...

41
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,815
is full of surprises.

42
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,180
Consider the fate

43
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,009
of this creature's poor mother,

44
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,618
struck down...

45
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,895
in the fourth month
of her condition by wild elephants.

46
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,770
Struck down...

47
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,372
on an uncharted African isle.

48
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,012
The result...

49
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,015
is plain to see.

50
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,810
Ladies and Gentlemen,

51
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,018
the terrible...

52
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,052
Elephant Man!

53
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,017
Stand up!
- Stand up!

54
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,816
Turn around!
- Turn around!

55
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,018
You'll bring him to me
tomorrow, ten o'clock, Mr....?

56
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,020
Bytes. He'll be there.

57
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,817
Here is my card. I'll send a cab.

58
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,820
We have a deal.

59
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,611
We understand each other,

60
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,014
more than money has changed hands.

61
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,578
We understand each other
completely, my friend.

62
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,409
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Bytes.

63
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,529
Cor, what a stink!

64
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,815
I'm looking for Mr. Frederick Treves.

65
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,818
Please, ma'am.

66
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,614
I'll send for him. Nurse!

67
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,859
Mr. Treves, this...

68
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,416
Yes.
- Says, that...

69
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,816
Yes, I was expecting him.

70
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,132
Are you the cab driver? - Yes.
- Anyone else with you?

71
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,971
No, just this gentleman.
- Thank you for your troubles.

72
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,538
Not at all. My pleasure.
- Thank you.

73
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,933
This way, please?

74
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,969
I'll be in my room
and I'm not to be disturbed.

75
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,376
Of course, sir.

76
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,056
Will you come with me?

77
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,738
You heard the doctor?

78
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,971
Go on!

79
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,857
My name is Frederick Treves and I'm
the surgeon at the London Hospital.

80
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,255
And...

81
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,010
I lecture in anatomy
at the medical college.

82
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,814
Sorry.

83
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,934
I'd like very much to examine you.

84
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,011
Would that be alright?

85
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,819
Please.

86
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,536
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

87
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,855
Would that be alright?

88
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,009
Your owner...The man,
who looks after you, tells me that...

89
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,015
you're English
and that your name is John Merrick.

90
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,416
John Merrick, is that right?

91
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,817
I tell you what,
I think I'll ask you a question

92
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,575
and you shake you head for 'no'.

93
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,098
Have you always been this way?

94
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,856
Are you in any pain?

95
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,890
Are your parents still alive?

96
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,529
Do you understand me? Your father,
your mother, are they dead?

97
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,693
Freddie, what are you doing...?

98
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,416
Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea...

99
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,811
What have you got there?
- You'll find out at the meeting.

100
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,694
Until then, not a word to anyone.

101
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,938
Alright.
You must have quite a find in there.

102
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,009
I don't know.
- "Nothing of any importance", eh?

103
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,052
Not a word, please, Fox.

104
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,893
Alright.

105
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,619
I think I'll examine you now.

106
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,609
I'll leave the questions till later.

107
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,219
Will you take your hat off?

108
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,290
Don't be frightened.
I simply want to look at you.

109
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,177
Take your hat off.
Don't be frightened.

110
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,819
Thank you. Good afternoon.

111
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,011
Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rogers!

112
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,010
Pull the curtains aside!

113
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,014
He's English. He is 21 years of age.

114
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,211
His name is John Merrick.

115
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,659
In the course
of my profession I have come upon

116
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,695
many deformities of the face
due to injury or disease

117
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,577
as well as mutilations and contortions
of the body from like causes.

118
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,571
I have never seen such a perverted,
degraded version of a human being.

119
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,490
I wish to draw your attention to
his insidious conditions.

120
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,498
Can you see over there?

121
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,451
Note, if you will,
the extreme enlargement of the skull

122
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,569
and the limb, which is useless,

123
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,535
the alarming curvature of the spine.
Would you turn round, please?

124
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,413
Turn round, please!

125
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,013
The looseness of the skin

126
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,738
and the fibrous tumours
that cover 90% of the body.

127
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,130
There is every indication that these
afflictions have existed and have

128
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,219
progressed rapidly since birth.

129
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,776
He suffers from chronic bronchitis.

130
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,735
Interesting side note:
Despite these anomalies

131
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,776
the patient's genitals
remain entirely intact and unaffected.

132
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,017
Thank you.

133
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,538
And his left arm
is perfectly normal, as you see.

134
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,810
So gentlemen,

135
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,218
owing to the
congenital extostoses of the skull,

136
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,970
extensive papillomatous growths,
pendulous masses of skin,

137
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,298
the enlargement of
the right limb and all the bones,

138
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,459
the distortion of the head
and the extensive area

139
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,414
covered by papillomatous growth,

140
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,216
The patient
has been called the "Elephant Man".

141
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,009
Thank you.

142
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,413
You haven't
mentioned his mental state.

143
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,819
He's an imbecile, probably from birth.
A complete idiot.

144
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,539
Pray to God he is.

145
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,978
Where have you been?

146
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,209
Out!

147
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,809
How can I eat with a noise like that?

148
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,899
Bytes, don't!

149
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,613
Where were you? What did you do?

150
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,329
Our man is sick. Come right away!
- What is it?

151
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,008
Like this...

152
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,335
What did you do with him?
He's been like this all night!

153
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,772
He was fine when he left here.
Now look at him!

154
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,017
Yes, I intend to.

155
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,055
What happened?
- He had a fall. He falls.

156
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,376
Looks like a very severe fall.

157
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,014
He's a...

158
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,888
... clumsy soul.

159
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,491
Never looks where he's going.
But that's alright.

160
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,010
He has me to take care of him.

161
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,259
Why is he sitting up? He needs rest!

162
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,098
That's how he sleeps.

163
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,657
If he lies down, he'll kill himself.

164
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,172
His head's too big.

165
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,975
This man belongs in the hospital.

166
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,179
Can't you treat him here?
Listen, he's my livelihood.

167
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,612
We're business partners, he and l.

168
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,932
He's the greatest freak in the world!
- Now, you listen,

169
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,336
you're not going to have a livelihood
if he dies. Go and fetch a cab!

170
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,056
I truly appreciate this, my friend.

171
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,092
Listen,

172
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,576
there's much I can do for you.

173
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:34,413
I move in the proper circles.

174
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,490
In fact, anything at all,
if you take my meaning.

175
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,328
Everything will be taken care of.
- Good to do business with you.

176
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,009
Can I have a bowl of oatmeal?

177
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,171
Breakfasting with the patients?
- It's for a patient.

178
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,019
There you are.

179
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,490
Thank you. Good morning.
- Morning.

180
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,859
Come here a moment!

181
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,059
What's that you've got there?

182
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,654
Good Heavens! You haven't acquired
a taste for this stuff?

183
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,773
Yes, it's quite nutricious.
- Possibly.

184
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,496
Not quite the diet for
a grown man. Nurse!

185
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:16,490
Just take this to the patient
in the isolation ward, will you?

186
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,095
Yes, sir.

187
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,814
Don't be frightened.
He won't hurt you.

188
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,174
Won't he indeed. Just a moment!
There's something I want to say.

189
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,498
A hospital's no place for secrecy.

190
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,728
Doctors spiriting hooded figures
around cause comment.

191
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,775
Why wasn't he properly admitted?
Why the isolation ward?

192
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,054
He's not contagious, is he?
- No, he's got chronic bronchitis,

193
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,378
and he's been beaten.
- Why not the General Ward then?

194
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,210
He's seriously deformed.

195
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,178
I fear it could shock the patients.

196
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,978
Deformed, is that it?
ls he ultimately incurable?

197
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,217
Yes, sir.
- But you must be aware,

198
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,891
that this hospital
doesn't accept incurables.

199
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,970
I'm aware of that.
But this case is quite exceptional.

200
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,132
I quite appreciate your problem.

201
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,493
Why not contact
the Royal Hospital for lncurables?

202
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,172
Perhaps they might find him a place.
- Yes. Would you like to meet him?

203
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,695
Excuse me!

204
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,819
The Elephant Man.

205
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,254
Sorry.

206
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,614
Sorry.

207
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,010
I should have warned you.

208
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,892
Please forgive me. You alright?

209
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,769
Please send Mrs. Mothershead up here.

210
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,496
Tell her to knock and wait for me.

211
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,609
I'm sorry about that.

212
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,256
We'll bring you another breakfast.
You must be very hungry.

213
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,537
You'll be comfortable here.
I'll see you get everything you need.

214
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,655
Blimey!

215
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,656
So, this is the Elephant Man.

216
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,892
I ain't seen nothing like you before.

217
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,809
What the hell happened to you?

218
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,893
Dumb, eh?

219
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,020
I like people that can keep quiet.

220
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,410
Here, have a drink!

221
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,015
Go on! No?

222
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,815
You should be more sociable.

223
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,179
Get yourself disliked.

224
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:17,294
We're going to be good friends and my
friends will want to meet you.

225
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,938
And they will, believe me.

226
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,048
I've brought your breakfast.
What are you doing down there?

227
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,616
Come up on the bed.

228
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,095
Come on!

229
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,531
All he understands is a good smack.
- He's had his share of smacks.

230
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,496
That drives him under the bed.
Treat him with kindness and patience.

231
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,297
Perhaps you've
got time for that sort of treatment.

232
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,574
I've got a hospital to run.
Don't you waste your time, with him.

233
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,738
It's like talking to a brick wall.

234
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,819
I don't mean to be harsh,

235
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,930
but he doesn't belong here.

236
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:49,215
Honestly, sir,
what can you do for him?

237
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,253
By the way, Mr. Carr-Gomm said

238
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,089
he'd like to see you
when you can spare a moment.

239
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,609
Yes.
- Thank you.

240
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,493
I can't help you, unless you help me.

241
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,017
I believe there's something
you want to say to me.

242
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,655
Something back there.

243
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,012
I can't help you, unless you help me!

244
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,658
I believe you want to say something.

245
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,017
I've got to understand
what you're feeling and thinking.

246
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,612
Do you understand me?

247
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,011
Just nod your head.
Can you understand me?

248
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,009
Nod your head if you understand me.

249
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,013
Alright.

250
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,897
You do understand.

251
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,299
I want to hear you talk.
You are not a wall.

252
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,937
Do you understand?
I want you to talk to me.

253
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,814
Now. I want to hear you say it.

254
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:24,930
I want to hear how you say things.
I'm not going to hurt you.

255
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,608
Got to hear!

256
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:31,019
Very slowly, I want you to say "yes".

257
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,535
Say "yes".

258
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,255
Yes.

259
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,575
Yes!

260
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,250
Alright.

261
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,339
Now just once more: "yes".

262
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,012
I can understand that. That's good!

263
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,653
That's very good. Alright now

264
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,810
I'm going to say some words to you
and you repeat them. Understand?

265
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,299
Say "Hello, my name is..."

266
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,575
Hello.

267
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,609
My name is...

268
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,016
John Merrick.

269
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,138
John Merrick.

270
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,459
John, that's very good.
Say "John Merrick".

271
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,329
Merrick.

272
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,739
"Hello, my name is John Merrick".

273
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,772
Hello, my name is...

274
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,579
... is John Merrick.

275
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,294
You can speak!

276
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,008
How did you get up here?

277
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,130
I want my man back.
- Just a moment.

278
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,014
Never mind. I want my man.

279
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,213
He's still very sick.
Come downstairs and I'll explain.

280
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,615
No!

281
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,293
Don't.

282
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,370
You've had plenty of time to cure him.

283
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,768
And now he's leaving with me.

284
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,808
Do you understand me?

285
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,091
Now, Mr. Treves.

286
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,577
We made a deal.
- You misunderstood.

287
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,138
This man has suffered a severe fall.
If you take my meaning.

288
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,936
He is my patient now.
- Pull the other one!

289
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,658
I'm sorry. But all you do is profit
from another man's misery.

290
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,177
Do you think you are better than me?
- No.

291
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,009
You wanted the freak

292
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,052
to show your doctor chums,
make a name for yourself.

293
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,014
You, my friend...

294
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,013
I gave you the freak... on trust.

295
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,209
In the name of science.

296
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,778
And now I want him back!
- You do not own this man. Stop it!

297
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,969
I want him back!
- So you can beat him?

298
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,651
So you can starve him?
A dog in the street would fare better.

299
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,898
I'll go to the authorities.
- Go to them, then!

300
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,809
By all means.

301
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,457
They'll be interested
to hear your story and ours.

302
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,012
Now, I think

303
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,016
we really understand one another.

304
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,489
Alright.

305
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,773
Alright.

306
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,496
A singularly unattractive character!

307
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,899
It seems to me I might
as well meet this patient of yours.

308
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,014
Thank you very much.

309
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,010
Shall we say in a few days?

310
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,252
Two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?

311
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,892
Whatever's most convenient, sir.

312
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,258
Two o'clock then, tomorrow.

313
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,014
Thank you very much.

314
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,888
Two o'clock...

315
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,418
Morning, Mr Treves. Early again!
- Yes.

316
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,738
You'd have made a good milkman!

317
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,013
I'll keep that in mind.
- Okay, sir.

318
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,894
"He restoreth my soul.

319
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,777
He leadeth me into paths of...
righteousness for his name's sake."

320
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,017
"Righteousness!"

321
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:10,416
"He leadeth me into the paths of

322
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,737
righteousness for his name's sake."

323
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,818
Good. It's very good.

324
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,892
When your visitor comes today,
I want you to say it exactly the same.

325
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,572
When I introduce him to you,
just say the words you've learnt.

326
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,251
If you have trouble with the words,
I'll help you, nothing to worry about.

327
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:33,012
I'll introduce you to him and say:
"Please meet Mr. Carr-Gomm."

328
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,018
And will you say:

329
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,934
Hello, my name is John Merrick.

330
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,015
I'm very pleased to meet you.

331
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,011
Good. Good.

332
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,616
I'll go and get Mr. Carr-Gomm.

333
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,971
It is only a physical problem.

334
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,857
He has trouble with certain sounds
because of the constrictive deformity.

335
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,134
But he can talk.
- Is he able to understand?

336
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,771
Yes. Oh, yes.

337
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:17,216
Except he's so anxious to make a good
impression, that he might be nervous.

338
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,415
Come in!

339
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,770
May I introduce you to Mr. Carr-Gomm?

340
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,496
This is John Merrick.
- Hello.

341
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:02,569
My name is John Merrick.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

342
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,011
I'm very pleased to meet you.

343
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,056
How are you feeling today?
- I feel much better.

344
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,014
Are you comfortable here?

345
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,011
Everybody's very kind.

346
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,014
How is your bronchitis?

347
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:38,013
Mr. Merrick likes
the food here, don't you?

348
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,213
Much better than what I'm used to.
- Oh yes?

349
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,456
And what was that?

350
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,532
Potatoes.

351
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,211
You were flogged?

352
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,297
I feel much better now.

353
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,415
Splendid.
How do you find Mr. Treves

354
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,136
as a teacher, I mean?

355
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,012
Very kind.

356
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,578
How long did you and Mr. Treves
prepare for this interview?

357
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,014
Very kind.

358
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:42,451
I understand.
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

359
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,015
Good day.

360
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,013
It was very good, John.

361
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,931
I'll be back in a moment.

362
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,009
"The Lord is my shepherd,

363
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,020
I shall not want.

364
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,338
He maketh me lie down..."

365
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,614
A brave attempt but he simply
mouthed words taught by you.

366
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,291
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

367
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:23,459
"He retoreth my soul."

368
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,337
He simply doesn't belong here.
He should be constantly looked after.

369
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,340
I'm sorry, things have
turned out this way. Good day.

370
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,735
Yes.

371
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:39,289
"Though I walked through the valley of
the shadow of death, I fear no

372
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:44,291
evil, for Thou art with me,
Thy rod and Thy staff..."

373
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,378
Mr. Carr-Gomm!

374
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,619
What is it?

375
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,772
It's that!

376
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,329
I didn't teach him that part!

377
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:04,451
"Goodness and mercy
will follow me all the days of my life

378
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:10,133
and I shall dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."

379
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:17,539
How did you know the rest of it?
- Very strange.

380
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,012
How did you know
the rest of the 23rd Psalm?

381
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,892
I used to read the Bible every day.

382
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,810
I know it very well
and the Book of Common Prayer.

383
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,092
The 23rd Psalm's beautiful.
It's my favourite.

384
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,095
Come and see me in my office
when you're through.

385
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,008
There's something
important I want to say.

386
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:56,535
Goodbye.
I do hope we shall meet again.

387
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,769
Why didn't you tell me you can read?

388
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,336
I was frightened.

389
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:19,492
I see.
- I was afraid to talk.

390
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,289
Please forgive me.

391
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,851
Can you imagine the life he must
have had? - Yes, I think I can.

392
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:45,374
I don't believe so.
I don't believe any of us can.

393
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:01,378
Terrible though his appearance is,
so terrible, that nervous persons

394
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,857
fly in horror from the sight of him,

395
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:10,215
and that he is debarred from
earning his livelihood in any way.

396
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,448
Yet he is superior in intelligence.
He can read and write,

397
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:20,020
is quiet, gentle,
not to say even refined.

398
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,331
I should like to meet this gentleman.

399
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,815
Have you seen this?
- No.

400
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:08,817
Listen to this!
- Hey up, hey up!

401
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,575
Hey up!

402
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,253
Listen! This is a letter

403
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,689
to the London Times
from the governor of the hospital.

404
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,939
In a little room in one of attic wards
is a man named John Merrick,

405
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:32,419
so dreadful a sight, that he is
unable even to come out by day.

406
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:37,491
He's been called the "Elephant Man"
on account of his terrible deformity.

407
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:42,331
His appearance is so terrible,
that women and nervous persons

408
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,248
fly in terror at the sight of him.

409
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,368
And how do you get tickets to see him?

410
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,414
Your very own Sunny Jim!
- Let's go and see him!

411
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,011
Keep your shirt on.
The time must be right.

412
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:04,299
Now he's in the attic, but tomorrow
they'll move him to Bedstead Square,

413
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:09,018
right into my lap.
Then, for the right price

414
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:15,019
you'll see something you'll
never ever see again in your life!

415
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:07,015
Don't look so glum girls!
Volunteers should be more cheerful!

416
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,770
Put your collar straight, girl!

417
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,176
And remember

418
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:18,011
that under no circumstances whatsoever

419
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,017
are any mirrors to be brought here.
- Yes, Mrs. Mothershead.

420
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,020
Yes, Mrs. Mothershead.
- Yes.

421
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,693
Right.

422
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:37,016
He's so ugly!
- Well, ugly or not, help me!

423
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,569
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?

424
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,009
Yes.

425
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,010
You look nice in your new clothes.

426
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,770
Thank you very much.
- Well, if there's nothing else,

427
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,690
we'll be leaving you now.
- No, there's nothing.

428
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,732
Ready for tea?

429
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,808
Please go in, John.

430
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,138
Make yourself comfortable.

431
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,012
Anne, come and meet our guest.

432
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,375
I'd like you to meet my wife, Anne.

433
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,015
Anne, this is John Merrick.

434
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,019
I'm very pleased to meet you.

435
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,695
I...

436
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,618
I'm very pleased.

437
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:36,054
What is it? What's the matter?

438
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,011
It's just that I...

439
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,936
I'm not used

440
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,820
to being treated so well

441
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,775
by so beautiful a woman.

442
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,936
Would you like a cup of tea?
- That's a good idea.

443
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,816
Come and see the rest of the house!

444
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,296
How's your tea?

445
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,248
Very good.

446
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,016
I'm enjoying my visit very much.

447
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:35,611
It's very kind of you
to invite me to your home.

448
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:43,896
I'm sorry
that I made a spectacle of myself.

449
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,853
No, not at all.

450
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,015
I love the way

451
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,929
you've arranged the pictures.
- Oh, thank you.

452
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,497
Is that the way in most houses?

453
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,329
Yes, I'm sure it is.

454
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,771
Who are they of?

455
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:11,533
These are relatives
and these are our children.

456
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,335
Children? May I see?

457
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,333
Yes, of course.

458
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,655
Where are the children?

459
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,737
They're out with friends.

460
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,819
Friends...

461
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,813
Here is Frederick's mother.

462
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,732
And these are my parents.

463
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:55,016
They have such noble faces.

464
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,778
Yes, I've always thought so myself.

465
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,419
Would you...

466
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,450
care to see my mother?

467
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,019
Your mother?

468
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,819
Yes, please.

469
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,818
Oh, but she's...

470
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,092
Mr. Merrick, she's beautiful!

471
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,655
She has...

472
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,015
She has the face of an angel.

473
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,813
I must...

474
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,737
I must have been
a great disappointment to her.

475
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,211
No, Mr. Merrick, no.

476
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:55,092
No son as loving as you
could ever be a disappointment.

477
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:00,337
If only I could find her!

478
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:05,808
If she could see me
with such lovely friends,

479
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,412
perhaps she could love me as I am.

480
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:17,011
I've tried so hard to be good.

481
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,574
I'm so sorry.

482
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,534
Sorry.
- Please!

483
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,857
I'm so sorry.

484
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,010
Please!

485
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,611
What's that you're doing?

486
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,416
What is it?

487
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,694
Oh, I see! St. Philip's!

488
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:26,770
Why, it's very good!
You've got the windows just right!

489
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,013
I wish

490
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,016
I could sleep

491
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,098
Iike normal people.

492
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,812
Mr. Treves,

493
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:05,052
there's something
I've been meaning to ask you

494
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,810
for some time now.
- What's that?

495
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,858
Can you cure me?

496
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,255
No.

497
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,255
No. We can care for you,

498
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,568
but we can't cure you.

499
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:23,975
No.

500
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,019
I thought not.

501
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,378
Come in.

502
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,656
Good morning!

503
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,531
Good morning.
- Someone would like to meet you.

504
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:51,859
May I introduce you to one of the
bright lights of the English stage?

505
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,734
Mrs. Kendal, this is John Merrick.

506
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:59,696
Good day!
- Good day.

507
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,574
I've brought you some things.
I hope you like them.

508
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:08,299
I hope you don't think it too forward?
- Oh, no.

509
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:13,008
I knew you'd understand.
- I'll leave you together.

510
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,013
Here.

511
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:23,093
I want you to know I don't give
my pictures to just anyone.

512
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:26,771
No, I wouldn't think of it.

513
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:31,657
It's beautiful. You're so...

514
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,412
I'll put it...

515
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,017
in a place of honour.

516
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:46,217
Next to my mother.

517
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:55,176
She's very pretty, your mother.
- Yes.

518
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:11,332
You're constructing a... church?

519
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:17,013
No. It's a cathedral.

520
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:18,495
Do you see?

521
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:24,612
I have to rely on my imagination,

522
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:28,894
for what I can't actually see.

523
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:43,416
Mr. Treves tells me
you're in the theatre.

524
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:48,376
Do you live there?
- Oh no, I just work there.

525
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:54,770
It must be wonderful to work there.

526
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:58,257
Is it beautiful?
- You've never been?

527
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,812
I'm afraid not.

528
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:05,134
You must go! The theatre is
the most beautiful place on earth!

529
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,413
Of course I am a bit partial.

530
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:12,011
The theatre is romance.

531
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,055
Romance?

532
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:18,095
Oh yes...

533
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:23,018
I've brought you something else!

534
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:31,812
Thank you.
- Have you read it?

535
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:35,491
No, but I certainly shall.

536
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:47,254
"Romeo and Juliet"!

537
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,009
Yes, I've heard of this.

538
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:57,892
"If I profane with my unworthiest hand

539
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:03,414
this holy shrine,
the gentle fine is this:

540
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:09,218
Thy lips, two blushing pilgrims,

541
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:17,294
ready stand, to smooth that
rough touch with a tender kiss."

542
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:22,290
"Good Pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much,

543
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:24,731
which mannerly devotion show in this.

544
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:28,809
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch.

545
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,410
And palm to palm's
holy Palmer's kiss."

546
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:38,772
"Oh then, dear Saint,
let lips do what hands do.

547
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:45,693
They pray, grant thou
lest faith turn to despair."

548
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:51,294
"Saints do not move,
though grant for prayer's sake."

549
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:59,373
"Then move not,
while my prayer's effect I take.

550
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:05,338
Thus from my lips,
by thine, my sin is purged."

551
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:12,250
And then it says: they kiss.

552
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,776
"Then have my lips
the sin that they have took."

553
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:26,938
"Sin from my lips?

554
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:30,929
O trespass, sweetly urg'd.

555
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:34,850
Give me my sin again."

556
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:44,058
You're not an Elephant Man at all.

557
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:47,536
No?

558
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,615
No. You're Romeo.

559
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,010
"Mrs. Kendal,
always at the forefront of fashion,

560
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:05,099
was seen leaving
"The London" the other afternoon.

561
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:09,135
No, dear readers,
the actress has not been taken ill,

562
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:14,859
but said she was visiting a friend.
Who was the lucky recipient?

563
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:19,259
Enquiries proved it to be none other
than John Merrick, the Elephant Man,

564
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,453
with whom our readers are familiar.

565
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:28,930
After a chat of 45 minutes, she left
him with an autographed portrait."

566
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,132
I saw it in his room.

567
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,652
"Owing to a disfigurement
of the most extreme nature,

568
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:38,775
Mr. Merrick has never been
presented to London society.

569
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:43,498
But knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal
goes, other inevitably follow,

570
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:47,979
the question arises - will London
society present itself to him?"

571
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:51,890
This walking stick is so dashing!

572
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:56,015
And more elegant than my old one!

573
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,051
More tea?

574
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:09,691
I don't go out
as often as I would like,

575
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:15,260
because naturally people find
my appearance disturbing.

576
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,009
If you have a chill
I could close the window.

577
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:21,338
No, I'm fine, please...

578
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:22,735
Thank you.

579
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,415
Thank you.

580
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,299
You see,

581
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:34,808
people are frightened
by what they don't understand.

582
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:41,855
And it is hard to understand,
even for me because my mother

583
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:45,688
was so very beautiful!

584
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,939
No more visitors today.

585
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:01,452
I've got a lecture. Till this evening!
- Excuse me, sir,

586
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:05,051
I would like a word with you.
- What is it?

587
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,617
I don't quite understand

588
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:11,938
why you allow people in there.

589
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,575
He enjoys it and it's good for him.

590
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:19,377
But you saw the expression on their
faces, they didn't hide their disgust!

591
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:23,369
They don't care about John.
They want to impress their friends.

592
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:27,290
I think you're being rather harsh.
- I beg your pardon.

593
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:31,210
You hardly showed him much kindness
when he first arrived, did you?

594
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:34,970
I bathed him, I fed him
and I cleaned up after him!

595
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,570
And my nurses do the same.

596
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:44,619
If "kindness" can be called care

597
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,733
then I did show him loving kindness!

598
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,252
I didn't mean it exactly that way.

599
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:55,295
I appreciate your concern
and everything you've done for him.

600
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:59,528
But I am the physician
and must do what's best for him.

601
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:03,211
Please now, I'm very late.
- If you ask my opinion,

602
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:08,609
he's only being stared at again!
- Thank you.

603
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:36,011
Night time!

604
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,335
Freddie!

605
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:21,018
What's the matter?

606
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:28,571
I've been thinking about Mr. Bytes.
- Why on earth?

607
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:33,013
I believe Mr. Bytes and I
are very much alike.

608
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,013
That's absurd!

609
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,614
It seems I've

610
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:44,337
made Mr. Merrick
into a curiosity again,

611
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:48,216
only this time in a hospital
rather than a carnival.

612
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,413
My name is constantly in the
newpapers and I'm always being

613
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:58,695
praised to the skies. Patients
ask expressly for my services.

614
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,096
Because you are a fine doctor.

615
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:05,738
John Merrick is happier and more
fulfilled then ever

616
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:09,013
and it's completely due to you.

617
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:13,574
What was it all for? Why did I do it?

618
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,614
What are you trying to say?

619
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,814
Am I a good man

620
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:25,649
or am I a bad man?

621
01:14:29,937 --> 01:14:32,815
Steady on, Treves. Steady on.

622
01:14:33,497 --> 01:14:35,567
Please sit down, won't you?

623
01:14:40,897 --> 01:14:45,607
We usually open the proceedings
by reading the minutes.

624
01:14:46,057 --> 01:14:49,891
In the interests of urgency
I think we should conclude the matter

625
01:14:50,337 --> 01:14:54,694
under discussion, the case of
John Merrick, the Elephant Man.

626
01:14:55,137 --> 01:14:57,890
One moment, Mr. Chairman!

627
01:14:58,337 --> 01:15:02,296
As far as I'm concerned, this
creature has no business here.

628
01:15:03,337 --> 01:15:07,808
I for one am sick and tired
of this freak-hunting

629
01:15:08,257 --> 01:15:12,648
by ambitious young doctors,
trying to make name's for themselves.

630
01:15:13,097 --> 01:15:16,373
To parade them about
in front of the society is one thing,

631
01:15:16,817 --> 01:15:20,492
but to waste the committee's time
with requests for shelter

632
01:15:20,937 --> 01:15:24,213
for these abominations of nature
is quite another.

633
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:30,612
You must be more careful!

634
01:15:31,137 --> 01:15:34,095
In the light
of these facts, our course is clear:

635
01:15:34,537 --> 01:15:38,530
The question is not whether to
accept this creature as a patient, but

636
01:15:38,977 --> 01:15:43,289
when will the rooms be vacated
for the use of more deserving cases?

637
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:48,166
I move that this Elephant Man be
removed from the premises immediately.

638
01:15:48,617 --> 01:15:51,814
We have
a sacred duty to cure the sick

639
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:56,648
not to care for circus animals!
That is my last word on the subject.

640
01:15:57,097 --> 01:16:01,534
Shall we vote?
- You are unshakeable in this?

641
01:16:01,977 --> 01:16:04,537
Mr. Chairman, do you not have ears?

642
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,411
I am unalterably opposed!

643
01:16:08,177 --> 01:16:10,054
My mind is made up.

644
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,889
You shall not sway me.
May we now vote,

645
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,612
at long last?

646
01:16:18,737 --> 01:16:19,772
Yes, Broadneck.

647
01:16:20,217 --> 01:16:22,606
I think the time has come.

648
01:16:23,057 --> 01:16:25,776
Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness

649
01:16:26,217 --> 01:16:29,289
Alexandra, Princess of Wales.

650
01:16:46,417 --> 01:16:48,772
Good morning.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

651
01:16:49,217 --> 01:16:53,335
Your presence here
is always greatly appreciated.

652
01:16:53,777 --> 01:16:57,326
We were just taking a vote
on Mr. Merrick.

653
01:17:00,537 --> 01:17:04,007
Her Royal Highness has shown
great interest in Mr. Merrick's fate.

654
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:06,493
I have, sir, as has the Queen.

655
01:17:09,817 --> 01:17:14,766
I have a communication from the
Queen, which I should read to you.

656
01:17:17,857 --> 01:17:20,769
"To the Governing Committee,
London Hospital.

657
01:17:28,137 --> 01:17:30,605
I would like to commend you

658
01:17:31,057 --> 01:17:34,766
for the charitable face
you have shown Mr. John Merrick.

659
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:39,688
It is laudable that you have
provided one of England's

660
01:17:40,137 --> 01:17:44,210
unfortunate sons with a safe
and tranquil harbour, a home.

661
01:17:44,657 --> 01:17:48,445
For this immeasurable kindness,
as well as the many acts of mercy

662
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:51,775
on behalf of the poor,
of which Mr. Carr-Gomm

663
01:17:52,217 --> 01:17:54,367
has kept me informed,

664
01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:59,208
I gratefully thank you.
Signed, Victoria."

665
01:18:04,057 --> 01:18:07,936
I am sure I can count on you
gentlemen to do the Christian thing.

666
01:18:08,377 --> 01:18:12,006
Thank you very much.
I'm sure we shall all try.

667
01:18:13,017 --> 01:18:17,647
I move that Mr. John Merrick
be admitted on a permanent basis

668
01:18:18,097 --> 01:18:23,808
provided the hospital receives
a yearly sum for the cost of one bed.

669
01:18:24,457 --> 01:18:26,652
All those in favour?

670
01:18:37,777 --> 01:18:40,735
Thank you, gentlemen.
The motion is carried.

671
01:18:46,257 --> 01:18:48,407
Yes, come in!

672
01:18:54,137 --> 01:18:59,006
Good afternoon. Mr. Carr-Gomm
has something he wants to say to you.

673
01:19:00,017 --> 01:19:01,973
Mr. Merrick, I am very pleased

674
01:19:02,417 --> 01:19:06,410
in being able to welcome you
officially to the London Hospital.

675
01:19:06,857 --> 01:19:11,214
The Governing Committee has
unanimously voted that you should be

676
01:19:11,657 --> 01:19:15,286
provided with these rooms on a
permanent basis. This is your home.

677
01:19:15,737 --> 01:19:20,288
I'm so very very glad for you.
- Welcome home, lad!

678
01:19:24,337 --> 01:19:25,816
This is...

679
01:19:27,777 --> 01:19:30,007
my home?
- Yes.

680
01:19:30,457 --> 01:19:34,530
Please will you thank
the committee for me?

681
01:19:34,977 --> 01:19:39,653
I will do my utmost
to merit their kindness.

682
01:19:40,097 --> 01:19:44,488
This... is my home?

683
01:19:45,737 --> 01:19:48,012
Yes. And this is for you.

684
01:19:54,737 --> 01:19:56,011
Your dressing case!

685
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:07,009
Oh, thank you!

686
01:20:07,897 --> 01:20:10,013
Thank you!

687
01:20:12,697 --> 01:20:14,176
Oh my friends, thank you!

688
01:20:14,617 --> 01:20:16,016
Thank you!

689
01:20:18,057 --> 01:20:19,888
My friends!

690
01:20:25,217 --> 01:20:26,696
Oh my friends!

691
01:20:27,137 --> 01:20:29,093
Oh my friends!

692
01:20:29,537 --> 01:20:31,573
Thank you!

693
01:20:55,257 --> 01:20:57,817
Who's next?
- I say!

694
01:20:59,257 --> 01:21:01,248
What you again?
- Well...

695
01:21:01,697 --> 01:21:04,006
These young ladies have never seen it.

696
01:21:07,937 --> 01:21:09,495
You're on, mate!

697
01:21:12,137 --> 01:21:14,412
That's it for this performance!

698
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:18,249
Jim, can I go?
- Sit down, Charlie!

699
01:21:18,697 --> 01:21:21,006
There's always tomorrow, don't worry.

700
01:21:25,137 --> 01:21:27,287
Room for one more?

701
01:21:27,737 --> 01:21:30,012
At the right price.

702
01:21:31,897 --> 01:21:32,932
There's room.

703
01:21:44,257 --> 01:21:46,896
Keep the noise down!

704
01:21:49,097 --> 01:21:52,294
We don't want to frighten him!

705
01:22:24,177 --> 01:22:29,297
My name is John Merrick.

706
01:22:30,497 --> 01:22:35,696
I'm very, very pleased to meet you.

707
01:22:40,737 --> 01:22:42,011
I think

708
01:22:43,737 --> 01:22:46,615
you are very beautiful!

709
01:22:49,737 --> 01:22:51,807
Curtain time!

710
01:22:52,337 --> 01:22:55,852
You look beautiful, darling!
I wouldn't change a thing!

711
01:22:56,937 --> 01:22:59,610
You look like the Prince of Wales!

712
01:23:01,057 --> 01:23:03,013
Here, my friends!

713
01:23:04,617 --> 01:23:06,130
The Elephant Man!

714
01:23:09,537 --> 01:23:13,655
I told you it was horrible,
just horrible.

715
01:23:22,737 --> 01:23:25,490
Perhaps the ladies
would like a closer look?

716
01:23:25,937 --> 01:23:29,566
Yes, yes!
- No, Jack, please!

717
01:23:30,497 --> 01:23:32,010
Right, in you go!

718
01:23:37,537 --> 01:23:39,812
He's quite a ladies' man!

719
01:23:41,457 --> 01:23:44,176
Give the ladies' man a little kiss!

720
01:23:45,337 --> 01:23:47,453
Go on, give him a kiss!

721
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:49,728
Jack, leave off!

722
01:23:59,297 --> 01:24:01,492
That's enough romance!

723
01:24:01,937 --> 01:24:03,336
Time for beddy-byes!

724
01:24:51,697 --> 01:24:53,972
Keep the noise down!

725
01:24:54,417 --> 01:24:58,012
Keep it quiet! Now watch this!

726
01:25:41,297 --> 01:25:43,367
Okay, that's enough!

727
01:25:44,417 --> 01:25:47,250
Show's over!
See you back at the Peacock!

728
01:25:50,257 --> 01:25:52,009
Get out of it!

729
01:26:20,257 --> 01:26:21,406
Here, come on.

730
01:26:24,737 --> 01:26:27,376
There you are. That's better.

731
01:26:30,257 --> 01:26:32,327
I've done well tonight.

732
01:26:32,777 --> 01:26:34,005
Here,

733
01:26:34,817 --> 01:26:37,092
buy yourself a sweet!

734
01:27:02,257 --> 01:27:03,485
My treasure!

735
01:28:04,737 --> 01:28:05,692
John?

736
01:28:10,017 --> 01:28:10,972
John!

737
01:28:17,657 --> 01:28:20,888
Mr. Treves,
I know what happened last night.

738
01:28:30,737 --> 01:28:31,692
Oh, God!

739
01:28:50,857 --> 01:28:52,006
Where is he?

740
01:28:52,457 --> 01:28:54,015
Where is Mr. Merrick?

741
01:29:00,057 --> 01:29:02,696
Where is Mr. Merrick?

742
01:29:04,697 --> 01:29:07,495
I don't know what you mean.
- Don't lie to me!

743
01:29:08,857 --> 01:29:11,417
I know all about it, you were seen.

744
01:29:11,857 --> 01:29:16,248
You're involved with Bytes,
aren't you? Where is he?

745
01:29:16,697 --> 01:29:20,770
Wait a minute! I haven't taken him
anywhere. I dunno no Bytes.

746
01:29:21,217 --> 01:29:26,655
We were just having a bit fun.
We never hurt him.

747
01:29:27,097 --> 01:29:29,611
You tortured him! He's gone!

748
01:29:30,057 --> 01:29:32,366
When I left him he was in bed!

749
01:29:35,577 --> 01:29:38,808
You're not listening to me!
I dunno no Bytes!

750
01:29:39,257 --> 01:29:44,251
I've done nothing wrong!
People pay money to see your monster!

751
01:29:44,697 --> 01:29:47,291
You're the monster, the freak.
Get out of here!

752
01:29:47,737 --> 01:29:52,288
Get out!
- You don't frighten me!

753
01:29:53,777 --> 01:29:56,337
I'm glad what I done.
You can do nothing about it!

754
01:29:56,777 --> 01:30:00,008
Only Mothershead can sack me now!

755
01:30:04,537 --> 01:30:05,606
Done!

756
01:30:22,057 --> 01:30:24,093
There's something I'd like to say.

757
01:30:25,177 --> 01:30:28,328
You know I felt
as deeply as you did about John.

758
01:30:28,777 --> 01:30:32,406
Well now he's disappeared,
very likely to the continent.

759
01:30:32,857 --> 01:30:37,533
You can't go after him,
you're needed here by your patients.

760
01:30:37,977 --> 01:30:42,334
You did everything in your power.

761
01:30:42,777 --> 01:30:45,007
Everything in your power.

762
01:32:09,657 --> 01:32:11,010
Get a stool!

763
01:32:37,217 --> 01:32:38,696
Get up, you bastard!

764
01:33:03,257 --> 01:33:07,011
Look at all these beautiful animals!

765
01:33:11,177 --> 01:33:13,816
What a lot you have!

766
01:33:25,297 --> 01:33:27,492
That sly bastard!

767
01:33:32,257 --> 01:33:35,010
He's doing this to spite me!

768
01:33:45,057 --> 01:33:48,606
You're doing this to spite me
and it's got to stop!

769
01:33:49,057 --> 01:33:52,606
Bytes, he's sick!
- Let him die!

770
01:33:55,737 --> 01:33:58,410
But don't think
I'm going to bury that...

771
01:34:00,657 --> 01:34:03,490
bag of flesh. No!

772
01:34:10,657 --> 01:34:12,648
And that's a fact.

773
01:34:19,137 --> 01:34:22,527
Bytes, stop!
- I'm going to fetch that lump of fat!

774
01:34:38,177 --> 01:34:39,132
Stop!

775
01:35:07,137 --> 01:35:08,695
Bytes, stop!

776
01:36:13,857 --> 01:36:16,087
We've decided,

777
01:36:19,097 --> 01:36:22,328
we're going to get you out of here.

778
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:49,328
Alright?

779
01:38:06,057 --> 01:38:07,410
Luck, my friend!

780
01:38:10,137 --> 01:38:13,607
Luck! And who needs it more than we?

781
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:43,413
Sir, why is your head so big?

782
01:39:47,417 --> 01:39:49,009
Why is your head so big?

783
01:39:51,897 --> 01:39:55,128
Why is your head so big? Tell me!

784
01:40:00,817 --> 01:40:03,012
Why is your head so big?

785
01:41:23,217 --> 01:41:25,173
No!

786
01:41:26,697 --> 01:41:29,006
I'm not an elephant!

787
01:41:31,537 --> 01:41:34,449
I am not an animal!

788
01:41:37,057 --> 01:41:40,572
I am a human being!

789
01:41:45,417 --> 01:41:50,013
I am a man.

790
01:41:56,937 --> 01:41:59,007
Out of the way, sir. Excuse me!

791
01:42:02,497 --> 01:42:05,295
Mr. Treves, they've found him!

792
01:42:05,657 --> 01:42:08,091
They've found John!

793
01:42:27,577 --> 01:42:29,056
Keep still!

794
01:42:31,617 --> 01:42:34,256
It was nice of Mrs. Kendal
to give me this dress.

795
01:42:34,697 --> 01:42:36,608
It's beautiful!

796
01:42:39,977 --> 01:42:42,127
Does she know John's dying?

797
01:42:44,137 --> 01:42:47,686
Yes, she knows.

798
01:43:02,457 --> 01:43:04,607
How do I look?

799
01:43:05,057 --> 01:43:06,410
Splendid!

800
01:43:06,857 --> 01:43:10,532
You will not look out of place.
You look absolutely splendid!

801
01:43:10,977 --> 01:43:14,014
Splendid... Shall we go?

802
01:43:15,697 --> 01:43:20,691
I can't tell you
how sorry I am for what happened.

803
01:43:21,137 --> 01:43:24,049
You see, I had no idea.

804
01:43:24,497 --> 01:43:26,886
You mustn't blame yourself.

805
01:43:27,337 --> 01:43:30,852
Mr. Treves, don't worry about me.

806
01:43:31,697 --> 01:43:33,255
My friend,

807
01:43:33,697 --> 01:43:37,451
I am happy every hour of the day.

808
01:43:39,017 --> 01:43:43,408
My life is full,
because I know that I am loved.

809
01:43:47,217 --> 01:43:50,095
I have gained myself.

810
01:43:57,577 --> 01:44:02,856
I could not say that,
were it not for you.

811
01:44:07,457 --> 01:44:08,412
Well...

812
01:44:09,457 --> 01:44:13,530
you have done so much for me as well.

813
01:44:14,737 --> 01:44:15,806
Thank you!

814
01:44:20,937 --> 01:44:24,896
I'll fetch Mrs. Mothershead and Nora
and be back in a few minutes!

815
01:44:27,577 --> 01:44:29,568
Very good, my friend.

816
01:44:33,977 --> 01:44:35,410
My friend!

817
01:47:25,017 --> 01:47:26,735
Mrs. Kendal!

818
01:47:31,577 --> 01:47:34,853
Your Royal Highness,
Ladies and Gentlemen!

819
01:47:35,297 --> 01:47:39,813
Tonight's performance was special
for me, as it was to someone else,

820
01:47:40,257 --> 01:47:42,896
a man who knows and loves the theatre.

821
01:47:43,337 --> 01:47:46,170
And yet this
is the first time he's ever been here.

822
01:47:47,777 --> 01:47:51,486
I wish the whole company wishes
with all their hearts

823
01:47:51,937 --> 01:47:55,691
to dedicate tonight's performance
to Mr. John Merrick,

824
01:47:56,137 --> 01:47:58,207
my very dear friend.

825
01:48:09,817 --> 01:48:11,887
Go on, John, they want to see you!

826
01:48:12,337 --> 01:48:16,330
I can't.
- It's alright, stand up!

827
01:48:52,217 --> 01:48:55,607
I really did believe

828
01:48:56,057 --> 01:48:59,493
that the ogre
would never get out of the dungeon.

829
01:49:01,177 --> 01:49:03,486
You really enjoyed yourself.

830
01:49:04,537 --> 01:49:09,008
Oh, it was wonderful!

831
01:49:10,297 --> 01:49:13,050
We really must go again some evening.

832
01:49:13,497 --> 01:49:16,216
Oh, I hope so.

833
01:49:16,657 --> 01:49:18,010
Yes, we will, we will.

834
01:49:20,017 --> 01:49:21,894
Good, I'm pleased.

835
01:49:22,337 --> 01:49:26,967
I ought to go. Must get some sleep.

836
01:49:27,857 --> 01:49:30,007
Good night. Sleep well.

837
01:49:31,937 --> 01:49:34,770
And you too, my friend.

838
01:49:36,057 --> 01:49:39,174
So pleased you enjoyed yourself.
Good night.

839
01:49:43,577 --> 01:49:45,010
Good night.

840
01:51:10,697 --> 01:51:15,407
It's finished!

841
01:54:38,137 --> 01:54:42,016
Never, never! Nothing will die.

842
01:54:42,457 --> 01:54:46,052
The stream flows, the wind blows,

843
01:54:46,497 --> 01:54:50,536
the cloud fleets, the heart beats.

844
01:55:10,937 --> 01:55:12,973
Nothing will die.
