00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,990
# Three blind mice in a row

2
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:33,596
# Three blind mice, there they go

3
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:36,270
# Marching down the street, single file

4
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:38,543
# To a calypso beat all the while

5
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,591
# They're looking for the cat

6
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:43,615
# The cat that swallowed the rat

7
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:48,209
# They want to show that cat
the attitude ofthree blind mice

8
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:55,838
# Three blind mice, here and there

9
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:58,141
# Three blind mice, everywhere

10
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,198
# Searching all around for the cat

11
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:02,615
# All over Kingston town, pit-a-pat

12
00:03:02,824 --> 00:03:04,781
# They got the carving knife

13
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:07,200
# To cut the pussy cat's life

14
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:10,134
# The puss will get that knife for trifling

15
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:11,651
# The three blind mice

16
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:12,907
# Oh, the mice...

17
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:20,850
That's it. 100 honours, and 90 below.

18
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:23,776
Nicely done, Strangways.
I have to give it to you.

19
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:27,983
I must leave you for a few minutes.
Order a round on my chit, Professor.

20
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:29,191
Right.

21
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:32,118
Damn it all!
Must you always break off at this time?

22
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,079
My managing director's a creature of
habit. I get a call every day at this time.

23
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,376
Hurry back before the cards get cold.

24
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,820
20 minutes. And don't doctor
any hands for me while I'm away.

25
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,490
Same again.

26
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,742
Bless you, master.

27
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:09,328
- Hurry, man! Hurry!
- Get away, quick!

28
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:31,961
W6N... W6N... W6N.

29
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:34,564
Calling G7W.

30
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,755
How do you hear me? Over.

31
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:41,759
G7W London. G7WLondon.
Receiving you. Over.

32
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:44,701
Stand by to transmit.

33
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,093
Wait. Out.

34
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:10,444
Here.

35
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,668
Hello, W6N. Report my signals.

36
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:40,571
Report my signals. Over.

37
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:42,810
Hello, W6N. Over.

38
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:50,601
Foreman of signals - urgent.

39
00:05:56,343 --> 00:05:58,731
Get me the Ml6 radio security control.

40
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,084
What is it?

41
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:04,975
W6N, Jamaica. Broken contact, sir,
during a routine transmission.

42
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:06,182
Broken or faded?

43
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:08,872
Broken.
The carrier wave is still established.

44
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:13,105
- And the emergency frequencies?
- No joy on either. I'm still calling.

45
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:15,605
Keep trying.
Let me know when they come up.

46
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:20,302
Hello, W6N? W6N?
Report my signals. Over.

47
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:24,509
Foreman of signals, sir.
Jamaica's broken off mid-transmission.

48
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,077
No, sir. It's not a technical fault.

49
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:29,024
Yes, sir.

50
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:30,706
Will you tell him, sir?

51
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:32,295
Very good.

52
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,281
- Excuse me, sir. Are you a member?
- No, I'm looking for Mr James Bond.

53
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:46,196
- What name should I say, sir?
- Just give him my card, will you?

54
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,447
Would you like to leave your coat
over there, sir?

55
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,862
200,000 ŕ la banque.

56
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:04,536
- Suivi.
- Suivi.

57
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:07,774
- Carte.
- Carte.

58
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:14,360
Sept ŕ la banque.

59
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,728
200,000 ŕ la banque.

60
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:19,285
- Suivi.
- Banco suivi.

61
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:29,456
- Carte.
- Carte.

62
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,434
Huit ŕ la banque.

63
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,504
- Suivi.
- C'est suivi.

64
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:37,761
- The house will cover the difference?
- Oui, madame. Changeur, s'il vous plaît.

65
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:45,408
- Carte.
- Carte.

66
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:50,281
- Neufŕ la banque.
- I need another thousand.

67
00:07:50,547 --> 00:07:52,855
I admire your courage, Miss... uh...?

68
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:55,925
Trench. Sylvia Trench.

69
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,778
I admire your luck, Mr...?

70
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:01,605
Bond.

71
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,247
James Bond.

72
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:07,593
Mr Bond, I suppose you wouldn't
care to... um... raise the limit?

73
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:09,134
I have no objections.

74
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:12,283
Pas possible, madame. Ce n'estpas légal.

75
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:15,125
- Now.
- C'est suivi, monsieur.

76
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:21,427
Looks like you're out to get me.

77
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:24,134
It's an idea, at that.

78
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:27,656
- Eight.
- Huit ŕ la banque.

79
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:30,896
Neuf ŕ la banque.

80
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,465
- Excuse me, sir.
- Thank you.

81
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:36,442
André, I must pass the shoe.

82
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,332
I hope you'll forgive me,
but it's most important.

83
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:41,139
Thank you.

84
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:46,919
Have those changed, will you?

85
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:55,588
Too bad you have to go.
Just as things were getting interesting.

86
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:57,570
Yes.

87
00:08:57,775 --> 00:09:02,725
Tell me, Miss Trench, do you play any
other games? Besides chemin de fer?

88
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,793
Hmm. Golf,

89
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:06,951
amongst other things.

90
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:10,365
- Tomorrow afternoon, then.
- Tomorrow? Let me see...

91
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,029
And, uh, we could have dinner
afterwards, perhaps?

92
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:16,256
Sounds tempting.

93
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:18,815
May l, um,

94
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,735
Iet you know in the morning?

95
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:22,893
Splendid.

96
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:25,605
My number's on the card.

97
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:44,801
See if he's there, will you?

98
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:51,623
James, where on earth have you been?
I've been searching London for you!

99
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,067
007 is here, sir.

100
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:57,488
He'll see you in a minute.

101
00:09:57,701 --> 00:09:59,658
Moneypenny!

102
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,068
What gives?

103
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:03,682
Me. Given an ounce of encouragement.

104
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:08,065
You never take me to dinner
looking like this, James.

105
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,254
You never take me to dinner. Period.

106
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:14,429
I would, you know. Only M
would have me court-martialled for

107
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:16,923
illegal use of government property.

108
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:20,697
Flattery will get you nowhere.
But don't stop trying.

109
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,946
- Now...
- What's all this to-do about?

110
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,952
Strangways. And it looks serious.

111
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:29,552
We've been burning the air between
here and Jamaica for three hours.

112
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:31,578
Oh. In you go.

113
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:34,294
Don't forget to write.

114
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,572
Good evening, sir.

115
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:52,734
It happens to be 3am.

116
00:10:52,947 --> 00:10:54,903
When do you sleep, 007?

117
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:57,283
Never on the firm's time, sir.

118
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,787
Sit down.

119
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:05,822
Jamaica went off the air tonight,

120
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:09,089
in the middle of the opening procedure.
We've checked and...

121
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:11,578
Strangways has disappeared.

122
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:15,405
So has his secretary.
A new girl. We'd only just sent her out.

123
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:18,524
Was Strangways on something... special?

124
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,134
He was checking
an enquiry from the Americans.

125
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:25,599
They complained about interference
with their Cape Canaveral rockets.

126
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,668
They think it comes
from the Jamaica area.

127
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:33,225
- Does "toppling" mean anything to you?
- A little.

128
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,549
It's throwing the gyroscopic controls
of a guided missile off balance with a...

129
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,602
a radio beam or something.

130
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:44,806
Five million dollars' worth of missile
aimed at a spot in the South Atlantic,

131
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:48,543
but finishing up in the Brazilian jungle,
is bad enough.

132
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:52,818
Now they're gonna try orbiting a rocket
round the moon.

133
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,889
The American CIA sent a man down
to work with Strangways.

134
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:01,711
- A fellow called Leiter. Do you know him?
- I've heard of him. Never met him.

135
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,447
Has he found out anything important?

136
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:08,153
Better ask him. You're booked
on the 7 o'clock plane to Kingston.

137
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,193
That gives you exactly
three hours, 22 minutes.

138
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:14,945
Armourer.

139
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:20,403
You'll get a set of background papers
at the airport, in a self-destructor bag.

140
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:23,351
You can study them during the flight.

141
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:26,056
I want to know
what's happened to Strangways.

142
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:29,394
Sir.

143
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:32,931
Take off your jacket.

144
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,692
Give me your gun.

145
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:47,855
Yes, I thought so. This damn Beretta
again. I've told you about this before.

146
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,886
You tell him - for the last time.

147
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:55,629
Nice and light - in a lady's handbag.

148
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:57,943
No stopping power.

149
00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:00,097
Any comments, 007?

150
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:03,114
I disagree, sir.

151
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,910
I've used a Beretta for ten years.
I've never missed with it yet.

152
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:11,349
Maybe not, but it jammed on your last job
and you spent six months in hospital.

153
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:15,735
A double-O number means you're
licensed to kill, not get killed.

154
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:17,192
And another thing.

155
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:21,532
Since I've been head of Ml6, there's been
a 40% drop in double-O casualties.

156
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:24,961
I want it to stay that way.
You'll carry the Walther.

157
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:29,192
Unless you'd prefer to go back
to standard intelligence duties?

158
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:32,928
No, sir. I would not.

159
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:37,432
Then from now on you carry
a different gun. Show him, armourer.

160
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:42,985
Walther PPK. 7.65mm with a delivery
like a brick through a plate-glass window.

161
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:48,009
Takes a Brausch silencer,
with little reduction in muzzle velocity.

162
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:49,816
The American CIA swear by them.

163
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:52,971
- Thank you, Major Boothroyd.
- Thank you, sir.

164
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:55,927
- Any questions, 007?
- No, sir.

165
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:57,820
All right, then. Best of luck.

166
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,981
Thank you, sir.

167
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:04,740
007!

168
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:08,134
- Sir?
- Just leave the Beretta.

169
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:31,461
Miss Moneypenny, forget the usual
repartee. 007's in a hurry.

170
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:43,131
Ciao.

171
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:45,552
Good luck.

172
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,234
There! Now you made me miss it.

173
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:30,817
You don't miss a thing.

174
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,385
How did you get in here?

175
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:35,927
I decided to accept your invitation.

176
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:40,278
That was for tomorrow afternoon.

177
00:15:40,921 --> 00:15:43,673
Tell me...
Do you always dress this way for golf?

178
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:47,884
I changed into something more
comfortable. I hope I did the right thing.

179
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:50,092
You did the right thing,

180
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:53,586
but you picked the wrong moment.
I have to leave immediately.

181
00:15:53,857 --> 00:15:56,087
Oh, that's too bad.

182
00:15:57,113 --> 00:16:00,264
Just as things were
getting interesting again.

183
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:08,135
When did you say you had to leave?

184
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:11,379
Immediately.

185
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,885
Almost immediately.

186
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:30,370
Hello, New York. Your Pan-Am 323
just landed - Kingston, Jamaica.

187
00:16:35,504 --> 00:16:38,735
Would passengers
please go to terminal four?

188
00:16:58,009 --> 00:16:59,885
Taxi!

189
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,653
All right, then. Go ahead.

190
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,803
Help yourself.

191
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:07,240
- Taxi!
- Mr... Bond, sir?

192
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:09,376
Yes?

193
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:12,844
I'm Mr Jones - chauffeur from
Government House, sent to get you.

194
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,153
Fine. You can drop my luggage
at the hotel on the way.

195
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:19,289
- Hang on, I want to check my reservation.
- I can do that.

196
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,976
No, no. You just take care of the bags.

197
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,237
- Government House?
- Yes.

198
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:47,163
- Principal Secretary, please.
- Hold the line, please.

199
00:17:50,923 --> 00:17:53,961
- Who wants him?
- James Bond. Universal Exports.

200
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,477
Welcome to Jamaica, Mr Bond.

201
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,861
Yes, your head office
alerted us this morning.

202
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:04,178
- Are you free for lunch at one o'clock?
- One o'clock suits me fine.

203
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:08,115
- Have you sent a car for me?
- No, I didn't think you'd want one.

204
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:10,400
Quite right. One o'clock, then.

205
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:13,840
Forgive me if I'm... a few minutes late.

206
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,653
Thank you.

207
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:36,253
- Where to first, sir?
- Government House, but I'm in no hurry.

208
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:38,970
Just, uh... take me for a ride.

209
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:12,362
Do you always drive this fast?
I told you I wasn't in a hurry.

210
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:16,342
Sorry, sir, but I think there's
some fellow trying to follow us.

211
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:23,167
Then I suggest you... try and lose them.

212
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:45,386
Take the next turning on the right.

213
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:04,279
Now, Mr Jones.

214
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:07,454
Talk fast,
before your friend doubles back.

215
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:09,840
Who are you working for?

216
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:13,104
I... don't know what you're talking about.

217
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:16,708
- I was just sent to meet you at the airport.
- Ah, but by whom?

218
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,053
By...

219
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:20,950
- Government House.
- I don't think so.

220
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:25,354
Both hands on the wheel, Mr Jones.
I'm a very nervous passenger.

221
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:28,244
Get out - move!

222
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:31,690
Keep your hands where I can see them.

223
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:58,333
Get up!

224
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:12,847
- Now talk.
- All right.

225
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:14,023
All right.

226
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,115
Let me have a cigarette.

227
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:35,333
To hell with you!

228
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:01,061
Sergeant, make sure he doesn't get away.

229
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:08,836
Tut-tut-tut. Cyanide in a cigarette?

230
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:12,109
- Fantastic!
- No less.

231
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:13,882
Duff, what have you got for us?

232
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,038
The car was stolen and we haven't
been able to identify the driver yet.

233
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:20,588
But he surely wasn't a Kingston man.

234
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,551
Wherever he was from,
news of my arrival leaked.

235
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:27,761
- We didn't advertise it, I can assure you.
- Perhaps not.

236
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:31,211
I got the impression
someone had been selling tickets.

237
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:33,438
Anything more we can do for you?

238
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,450
I'd like to meet the last people
to see Strangways.

239
00:22:36,698 --> 00:22:40,087
Nobody seems to have seen him
after he left our bridge four.

240
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:42,326
- Who were the others?
- Professor Dent...

241
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,170
Metallurgist, runs a test laboratory.
Respected. Clean bill.

242
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:50,250
- Potter...
- Old general. Been here for ages.

243
00:22:50,552 --> 00:22:51,951
We'll start with those.

244
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:55,256
- Want them brought in?
- Lord, no! I want to meet them socially.

245
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,509
I can introduce you at the club tonight.

246
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,403
Fine.
We'll take a look at Strangways' place.

247
00:23:00,652 --> 00:23:02,607
I'll run you up there now.

248
00:23:15,214 --> 00:23:16,853
Go on in.

249
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:24,598
Yes, that's her blood patch.

250
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:30,092
- They've grouped it as O Rh positive.
- That's her group all right.

251
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,330
The set was still switched on
when we came round.

252
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,502
We tried to get through,
but it was dead the other end.

253
00:23:45,761 --> 00:23:51,200
And it'll stay dead. All frequencies are
changed immediately security's broken.

254
00:23:58,115 --> 00:24:00,309
Receipt from Dent Laboratories.

255
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:03,576
Is geology a hobby of Strangways'?

256
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:06,223
Not that I know of, no.

257
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:14,714
Who's the man with Strangways?

258
00:24:17,228 --> 00:24:19,183
One of the local fishermen.

259
00:24:19,397 --> 00:24:23,630
- He drove the car that tailed me.
- That gives us something to work on.

260
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:25,856
I'll have him checked.

261
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:30,432
You do that. I want to change before
I meet Pleydell-Smith at the club.

262
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:41,359
One medium-dry vodka martini -
mixed like you said, sir, and not stirred.

263
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:44,191
- Anything else, sir?
- No, that's all.

264
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:06,894
Curious, old Strangways
just vanishing like that. Or is it?

265
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:10,335
Cherchez la femme.
His secretary was very nice indeed.

266
00:26:10,605 --> 00:26:12,642
Did you know her?

267
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:15,167
I've seen her around, you know?

268
00:26:15,404 --> 00:26:18,635
None of you can throw any light
on what happened to him?

269
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,901
In his conversation? Any hint?

270
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:26,019
I only heard him talk about
big game fishing and bridge.

271
00:26:26,297 --> 00:26:27,969
Fishing was the latest craze.

272
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:31,371
He got the bug three weeks ago.
He's been out every day.

273
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:33,195
It must have cost something.

274
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:37,623
These fishermen ask the earth to charter,
and Quarrel's the most expensive.

275
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,816
Quarrel?

276
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:41,451
A Cayman lslander.
He keeps a boat in the harbour.

277
00:26:41,694 --> 00:26:42,207
I see.

278
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:56,090
- Excuse me. Where do I find Quarrel?
- He him.

279
00:26:56,346 --> 00:26:57,300
Thank you.

280
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:10,069
Is your name Quarrel?

281
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:12,430
Maybe.

282
00:27:12,621 --> 00:27:14,451
I'm a friend of...

283
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:16,816
Commander Strangways.

284
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:22,820
Now ain't that nice!
I like people who's friends of people.

285
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:26,967
I thought you might be able
to tell me what happened to him.

286
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:30,420
As far as I know, nothing happened.

287
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,530
Unless you know... different, Captain.

288
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:36,888
Where did you take him in your boat?

289
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:39,863
You see that, Captain?

290
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,036
That there's the Caribbean.

291
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:44,233
That's where.

292
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,614
Fishing.

293
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:49,311
I'm interested in fishing.
I'd like to charter your boat.

294
00:27:49,595 --> 00:27:51,586
I'm sorry, Captain. It's not for hire.

295
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:54,162
It seems I came to the wrong address.

296
00:27:54,394 --> 00:27:59,343
That's all right, Captain. Now, if you'll
excuse me, I got business to attend to.

297
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,035
Hey, Pussfeller.

298
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,828
Well, if it ain't my friend
what gets addresses mixed!

299
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:02,261
You got the right one,
if you likes good eating.

300
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:06,013
I do, if the... conversation matches it.

301
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:08,670
Back at the boat too public.

302
00:29:09,134 --> 00:29:12,365
- In there it different.
- Well, after you.

303
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:15,471
Sure thing.

304
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:22,501
- Hey, man! See we get a bit of privacy.
- Nothing but, Quarrel. Nothing but.

305
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,444
- Take a seat.
- No, I'm fine.

306
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:38,923
OK, mister.
Supposing you start the conversation.

307
00:29:39,284 --> 00:29:41,240
Now how's about it?

308
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:54,423
Ain't no use you struggling.
Pussfeller wrestles alligators.

309
00:30:02,028 --> 00:30:04,622
Right. Up slowly and face that wall.

310
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,336
Hold it.

311
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,846
Gently, bud. Gently.

312
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:25,224
Let's not get excited.

313
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,349
Frisk him.

314
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,588
Nothing.

315
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:49,383
Interesting.
Where were you measured for this?

316
00:30:49,643 --> 00:30:51,554
My tailor. Savile Row.

317
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,285
Is that so? Mine's a guy in Washington.

318
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:58,101
Felix Leiter. Central lntelligence Agency.

319
00:30:58,405 --> 00:31:00,362
You must be James Bond.

320
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:05,213
- You mean we're fighting the same war?
- Yeah. I spotted you at the airport, but...

321
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:09,171
when you left with the opposition
I figured I must be wrong.

322
00:31:09,464 --> 00:31:10,897
Quarrel's been helping me.

323
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:14,288
- No hard feelings, I hope?
- Glad to know you, Mr Bond.

324
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:16,432
Pussfeller owns the place.

325
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:20,921
- I hope he cooks better than he fights!
- Nobody died from my cooking - yet!

326
00:31:21,232 --> 00:31:23,792
# Down Kingston town, you know,
all the people go jump up

327
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:25,780
# Wavin' arms about, leapin' in and out

328
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,741
# It's so easy to jump up

329
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:29,670
# Take a pretty girl, take a whirl

330
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:31,623
# And then do it again, again jump up

331
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,471
# Hold her very tight,
then for all the night

332
00:31:34,711 --> 00:31:35,461
# Jump up

333
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,108
# Jump up, jump up

334
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,971
# Jamaica jump up, jump up

335
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:41,008
# Jamaica jump-up music

336
00:31:41,221 --> 00:31:43,451
# Jamaica never want to stop jump-up

337
00:31:43,683 --> 00:31:45,241
# Jump up, jump up

338
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,028
# Jamaica jump up, jump up

339
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:49,188
# Jamaica jump-up music

340
00:31:49,402 --> 00:31:51,357
# Jamaica never want to stop jump-up

341
00:31:59,362 --> 00:32:01,034
Cape Canaveral is screaming.

342
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,596
With this moon rocket launch,
they don't want anything to go wrong.

343
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:08,384
And Strangways didn't think
the interference came from here?

344
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,624
I suppose you cased the joint?

345
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,336
I checked - unofficially.

346
00:32:13,842 --> 00:32:16,560
You Limeys can be touchy
about trespassing.

347
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:19,478
Strangways and Quarrel
checked the offshore islands.

348
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:21,479
- You found nothing?
- Not a thing.

349
00:32:21,688 --> 00:32:24,441
- Where did you look?
- Just about most everywhere.

350
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,703
Fire lsland, Crab Key, Morgan's Reef.

351
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:29,063
Checked them all?

352
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,199
All except Crab Key.
We didn't have no right to go there.

353
00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:34,605
- Why not?
- It belongs to a Chinese...

354
00:32:37,546 --> 00:32:39,740
Get her, Quarrel - and the camera.

355
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,142
Evening, missis.

356
00:32:48,563 --> 00:32:50,201
You're hurting!

357
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:53,310
The Captain wants you
to have a drink with us.

358
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:55,924
You're hurting me!

359
00:32:56,115 --> 00:32:58,072
You can't mean it.

360
00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:07,336
Good evening.

361
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:15,584
Why do you want another picture of me?

362
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:18,280
Because I only got your hat at the airport.

363
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:22,075
- Tell this ape to let me go!
- Why do you want a picture at all?

364
00:33:22,365 --> 00:33:24,720
Because that's the way I earn my living.

365
00:33:25,912 --> 00:33:29,382
- Who pays you?
- Oh... The Daily Gleaner!

366
00:33:31,503 --> 00:33:33,460
Pussfeller! Pussfeller!

367
00:33:35,844 --> 00:33:38,199
- Anything I can do?
- Ever seen this girl before?

368
00:33:38,431 --> 00:33:39,989
She come here sometimes.

369
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:43,971
She being a nuisance to you?
You want for me to get rid of her?

370
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:48,631
No. Just ring the Gleaner. Find out
if they sent a photographer here tonight.

371
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,027
They didn't send me. I work freelance.

372
00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:54,720
Freelance, hm? For whom?

373
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:56,606
You...!

374
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,511
Tell us and he'll stop.

375
00:34:06,892 --> 00:34:11,010
We don't get nothing out of this gal.
You want for me to break her arm?

376
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,269
Another time.

377
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:21,173
The second time nothing's come out.
Give her her arm back.

378
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:24,329
Run along, Freelance.

379
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:27,900
You'll be sorry.
You'll all be sorry, you rats!

380
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:37,692
One takes cyanide, another would have
had her arm broken. Neither would talk.

381
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:42,777
- Who puts that sort of scare into people?
- I think we'd better find out, but fast.

382
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,992
You mentioned Crab Key.
Why can't we go over there?

383
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:50,202
It belongs to a Chinese character.
He won't allow anyone to land.

384
00:34:50,501 --> 00:34:53,492
Our naval reconnaissance planes
took a look.

385
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:55,711
They only found a bauxite mine.

386
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:57,882
Low-scan CH radar setup.

387
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,972
Nothing illegal about that.

388
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,572
That Crab Key scares me plenty.

389
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:06,186
Friends of mine went out there once
after seashells.

390
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:08,717
Only trouble, they never came back again.

391
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:11,300
Local fishermen won't go near it.

392
00:35:11,532 --> 00:35:13,523
Strangways and me slip in at night.

393
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:16,054
He take samples, we came straight back.

394
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,963
- Don't do to hang about there.
- What kind of samples?

395
00:35:19,503 --> 00:35:22,735
Oh, bits of rock. Sand. Water.

396
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,289
I see. Crab Key begins to interest me.

397
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:31,195
What else do we know
about this Chinese gentleman?

398
00:35:31,438 --> 00:35:33,474
Nothing much. Except his name.

399
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:36,525
Doctor No.

400
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:14,648
- I'd like to see Professor Dent, please.
- Have you an appointment?

401
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:17,525
James Bond.
We met yesterday at the Queen's Club.

402
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:20,202
Very well. He's somewhere in the lab.

403
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,356
Is Professor Dent there?

404
00:36:25,947 --> 00:36:27,539
Oh, never mind. Thank you.

405
00:36:27,742 --> 00:36:29,175
Morning, Professor.

406
00:36:30,914 --> 00:36:33,063
Mr Bond. Anything I can do for you?

407
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:36,603
Yes. I came across this
in Strangways' office.

408
00:36:37,507 --> 00:36:39,463
Your receipt.

409
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,114
Yes, that's right.

410
00:36:41,304 --> 00:36:43,500
Can you tell me anything about it?

411
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:49,164
Poor old Strangways.
Bit of a bug of his, this amateur geology.

412
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:53,599
He brought some rock samples in for
testing, convinced they were valuable.

413
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:55,340
Were they?

414
00:36:55,536 --> 00:36:58,369
No, of course not.
Just low-grade iron pyrites.

415
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:00,789
Can I see them?

416
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:03,277
Well, no, l... I threw 'em away.

417
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,139
- Do you know where he found them?
- No, he didn't say.

418
00:37:09,222 --> 00:37:12,818
- Crab Key, perhaps?
- Definitely not.

419
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:15,076
Why so certain?

420
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,599
- Not geologically possible.
- Thank you, Professor.

421
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,331
It's kind of you to spare me your time.

422
00:37:21,576 --> 00:37:23,532
You're welcome, Mr Bond.

423
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:25,784
Oh, Professor...

424
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,416
Allow me.

425
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:36,009
Morning.

426
00:37:55,168 --> 00:37:57,967
- Take me to Crab Key.
- I can't. You know the procedure.

427
00:37:58,215 --> 00:38:01,333
There's no time for procedure.
I'll take responsibility.

428
00:38:01,596 --> 00:38:03,507
Man, I hope you know what you're doing.

429
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:05,918
- Come on...
- All right.

430
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:51,744
- I radioed. They're expecting me.
- Go ahead.

431
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:39,530
Sit down.

432
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:51,101
Why have you disobeyed
my strictest rule and come in daylight?

433
00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:52,889
I had to.

434
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:55,195
Bond came to see me this morning.

435
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:59,967
Yes, I know. I gave orders that he should
be killed. Why is he still alive?

436
00:40:00,757 --> 00:40:02,713
Our attempts failed.

437
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:04,759
Your attempts failed.

438
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:09,012
I do not like failure. You are not
going to fail me again, Professor.

439
00:40:09,313 --> 00:40:11,952
No. I came to warn you.

440
00:40:12,483 --> 00:40:13,802
Warn me?

441
00:40:13,987 --> 00:40:15,784
Tell you.

442
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:19,460
Bond discovered Strangways'
rock samples came from Crab Key.

443
00:40:19,746 --> 00:40:21,976
He's not a fool.
He's sure to come out here.

444
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:26,086
I hope not.
If he does, I shall hold you responsible.

445
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,336
I make myselfclear?

446
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,507
Yes, quite clear.

447
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:35,163
Go to the table.

448
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:49,369
You see what is in the cage?

449
00:40:51,836 --> 00:40:53,793
Pick it up.

450
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,757
Pick it up!

451
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:07,521
Tonight.

452
00:41:23,177 --> 00:41:25,644
- I'd like to send a cable.
- Yes, of course.

453
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:30,204
By the way, the car you ordered,
it's been delivered.

454
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,675
It's in number five parking lot.

455
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,856
Thank you. Good night.

456
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,025
Good night, Mr Bond.

457
00:44:39,364 --> 00:44:41,594
- Morning, Pleydell-Smith.
- Morning, Bond.

458
00:44:41,827 --> 00:44:44,978
Sorry to trouble you so early.
I need some information.

459
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:47,557
All you have on Dr No and Crab Key.

460
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:50,646
Miss Taro, bring me the files on Dr No.

461
00:44:50,882 --> 00:44:51,871
Sit down.

462
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,847
What do you know about this island?

463
00:44:54,054 --> 00:44:56,409
Not much,
except there's a bauxite mine there.

464
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:59,235
Dr No runs the place
like a concentration camp.

465
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,835
I've heard funny rumours,
but no-one's complained officially.

466
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:09,076
- Right, Miss Taro. Just leave them here.
- I'm very sorry, but we can't find them.

467
00:45:09,411 --> 00:45:14,121
- What do you mean? Who had them last?
- Commander Strangways, sir. Both files.

468
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,610
All right, Miss Taro. All right.

469
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,556
Damn nuisance,
their disappearing like that.

470
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:22,635
On the contrary.

471
00:45:23,266 --> 00:45:25,621
I'd have been surprised if they hadn't.

472
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:29,813
By the way, that came for you from
London this morning, in the plane,

473
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:32,065
in the diplomatic pouch.

474
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:38,367
A present from home.

475
00:45:40,876 --> 00:45:43,152
Can I get out that way?

476
00:45:57,735 --> 00:46:01,445
That's a naughty little habit -
Iistening at keyholes.

477
00:46:01,742 --> 00:46:04,460
I wasn't listening.
I was looking for those files.

478
00:46:04,704 --> 00:46:07,298
Anything that can't be found,
I get the blame.

479
00:46:07,543 --> 00:46:10,659
Oh, forget it.
Actually, it's not very important anyhow.

480
00:46:10,922 --> 00:46:14,552
I hate to think of you spending
all afternoon looking for them.

481
00:46:14,846 --> 00:46:17,076
No. I have the afternoon off.

482
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:21,744
There's a coincidence. So have l.
Why don't you show me round the island?

483
00:46:22,065 --> 00:46:25,295
What should I say to an invitation
from a strange gentleman?

484
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:27,322
You should say yes.

485
00:46:27,532 --> 00:46:29,487
I should say maybe.

486
00:46:30,036 --> 00:46:31,753
Three o'clock, my hotel,

487
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,911
maybe?

488
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:36,431
Yes, maybe.

489
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,188
Good.

490
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:52,322
The luminous dial activates it.
Here, hold this.

491
00:46:52,581 --> 00:46:56,335
Now, where exactly did Commander
Strangways place those samples?

492
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,588
- About where your feet is, sir.
- Good.

493
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:07,480
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

494
00:47:07,688 --> 00:47:11,045
- Lose something?
- Take a look at this Geiger reading.

495
00:47:14,657 --> 00:47:18,936
Those samples Strangways brought back
from Crab Key... were radioactive.

496
00:47:19,248 --> 00:47:23,001
Yet Professor Dent told me
they were worthless chunks of iron ore.

497
00:47:23,295 --> 00:47:26,731
- He's either a bad professor or a poor liar.
- I intend to find out which.

498
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,682
Quarrel, how soon can you
get us over to Crab Key?

499
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:32,525
Well... it's like this here, Captain.

500
00:47:33,771 --> 00:47:37,286
Commander Strangways,
he done take samples of all the islands.

501
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:41,197
- We could check the nearest ones first.
- No. I'm interested in Crab Key.

502
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,960
I done take the commander there.
We got away without trouble.

503
00:47:45,246 --> 00:47:48,000
It don't do to tempt providence too often.

504
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:50,288
You see... there's a dragon.

505
00:47:50,505 --> 00:47:53,416
- What?
- Native superstition.

506
00:47:53,677 --> 00:47:55,632
Started by Dr No, probably.

507
00:47:56,764 --> 00:47:58,596
We won't force you to do anything.

508
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:02,768
Leiter and I will go after dark, if you'll
give us the navigational directions.

509
00:48:03,065 --> 00:48:07,378
I gets my navigational directions
from my nose, my ears,

510
00:48:07,697 --> 00:48:09,210
from my instincts.

511
00:48:10,494 --> 00:48:12,688
Anyway, I'll be here about seven.

512
00:48:15,001 --> 00:48:16,639
Fine.

513
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:26,400
Oh, Mr Bond!
There's a telephone message for you.

514
00:48:26,643 --> 00:48:28,521
Johnny, what have you done with it?

515
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:30,686
It's right here.

516
00:48:51,501 --> 00:48:53,378
Hello?

517
00:48:53,588 --> 00:48:55,545
Oh, Mr Bond!

518
00:48:55,925 --> 00:48:59,635
I was thinking, why don't you
collect me at my apartment?

519
00:49:00,766 --> 00:49:03,201
It's lovely up here in the mountains.

520
00:49:03,563 --> 00:49:05,440
Nice and cool.

521
00:49:05,648 --> 00:49:10,199
All right. You leave the Port Royal Road
out of Kingston,

522
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:15,454
then along the Wentworth Road,
until you get to the cement factory.

523
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:17,704
Then you turn left.

524
00:49:17,918 --> 00:49:19,954
Follow the road up the hill,

525
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:22,048
down the other side,

526
00:49:22,257 --> 00:49:28,367
then two miles further on, on the left,
Magenta Drive 239.

527
00:49:30,646 --> 00:49:32,681
I'll be waiting for you.

528
00:51:13,012 --> 00:51:14,889
How did it happen?

529
00:51:16,726 --> 00:51:19,480
I think they were on their way to a funeral.

530
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:41,746
Just a minute!

531
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,257
You did invite me here, remember?

532
00:51:53,478 --> 00:51:57,789
Oh, of course.
I just didn't expect you here so soon.

533
00:51:59,362 --> 00:52:01,318
Yes, yes, come in.

534
00:52:05,496 --> 00:52:08,056
Uh... I'll just go and put some clothes on.

535
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:10,726
Don't go to any trouble on my account.

536
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:14,402
Please!

537
00:52:14,594 --> 00:52:18,143
Forgive me. I thought I was
invited up here to admire the view.

538
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:25,500
I feel one of us should answer it.

539
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:34,726
Hello?

540
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:37,306
Yes. Yes, I know. He's here now.

541
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:43,922
I don't know what happened.

542
00:52:44,974 --> 00:52:48,523
All right. I'll try and keep him here
for a couple of hours.

543
00:52:49,438 --> 00:52:51,110
I'll have to go now.

544
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:53,394
All right. I'll call you later.

545
00:52:57,911 --> 00:53:00,708
You believe in living dangerously.
I can see that.

546
00:53:00,956 --> 00:53:02,628
What do you mean?

547
00:53:02,835 --> 00:53:06,463
Sitting around with wet hair,
you'll die of pneumonia.

548
00:53:09,804 --> 00:53:12,364
- It's rather beautiful.
- Thank you.

549
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:14,510
Do you always wear it up?

550
00:53:14,728 --> 00:53:16,639
- Don't you like it?
- Yes, very much.

551
00:53:17,858 --> 00:53:20,815
With your sort of... face... it's wonderful.

552
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,896
- What's going on behind my back?
- Nothing.

553
00:53:27,664 --> 00:53:29,621
Look - no hands.

554
00:53:45,775 --> 00:53:47,367
I'm hungry.

555
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,208
Let's go out and eat.

556
00:53:49,407 --> 00:53:54,561
- I'll make you a Chinese dinner here.
- No. I'm feeling ltalian and musical.

557
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:58,643
- Let's go to the Blue Mountain Grill.
- I'd rather stay here.

558
00:53:58,922 --> 00:54:00,514
It's more fun...

559
00:54:00,715 --> 00:54:02,114
alone.

560
00:54:02,302 --> 00:54:04,815
But I don't want you
getting dishpan hands.

561
00:54:05,056 --> 00:54:08,731
- I like cooking.
- Forget it. May I use your phone?

562
00:54:12,233 --> 00:54:14,030
Who are you ringing?

563
00:54:14,237 --> 00:54:16,193
Taxi.

564
00:54:17,324 --> 00:54:22,637
James Bond here. Can I have a car
sent to... 2171 Magenta Drive?

565
00:54:23,001 --> 00:54:25,594
As soon as you can, please. Thank you.

566
00:54:26,547 --> 00:54:28,503
I thought you came by car.

567
00:54:28,717 --> 00:54:31,391
Damn thing wouldn't start. Engine trouble.

568
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,594
That explains...

569
00:54:34,893 --> 00:54:36,407
Explains what?

570
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:38,561
Why you need a taxi.

571
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,273
Why I need a taxi?

572
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,735
Careful - my nail varnish!

573
00:54:54,715 --> 00:54:57,434
- The lights.
- No, no, I always leave them on.

574
00:55:01,643 --> 00:55:04,237
What's... What's going on?!

575
00:55:04,481 --> 00:55:08,519
Forgive me. Book her, Superintendent,
will you? And, uh...

576
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,335
be careful of her nail varnish.

577
00:56:32,978 --> 00:56:35,288
# Underneath the mango tree

578
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:40,076
# Me honey and me
come watch for the moon

579
00:56:40,824 --> 00:56:42,780
# Underneath the mango tree

580
00:56:43,036 --> 00:56:47,826
# Me honey and me make bu-lu-lup soon

581
00:56:48,378 --> 00:56:50,608
# Underneath the moonlit sky

582
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:55,398
# Me honey and I come sit hand in hand

583
00:56:56,014 --> 00:56:57,971
# Underneath the moonlit sky

584
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:02,753
# Me honey and I come make fairyland

585
00:57:04,027 --> 00:57:07,302
# Mango, banana and tangerine

586
00:57:07,574 --> 00:57:09,530
# Sugar...

587
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,510
Drop it, Professor! I'm behind you!

588
00:57:43,295 --> 00:57:45,809
I thought you'd turn up sooner or later.

589
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:48,005
Sit down.

590
00:57:50,474 --> 00:57:52,192
The girl talked?

591
00:57:52,393 --> 00:57:54,112
But of course.

592
00:57:54,313 --> 00:57:56,952
I was suspicious
at the Queen's Club anyhow

593
00:57:57,193 --> 00:58:02,027
when it turned out you were the only one
who'd seen Strangways' new secretary.

594
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,197
Then later, at the lab,

595
00:58:04,411 --> 00:58:10,202
you made no reference to the fact that
Strangways' samples were radioactive.

596
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:12,385
Very clever, Mr Bond.

597
00:58:13,802 --> 00:58:15,793
But you're up against
more than you know.

598
00:58:16,012 --> 00:58:18,163
Shoot me and you'll end up
like Strangways.

599
00:58:18,391 --> 00:58:22,067
- Then you killed him?
- He was killed, but never mind how.

600
00:58:22,523 --> 00:58:24,878
Who are you working for, Professor?

601
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:28,989
I'll tell you, as you won't live to use
the information. I'm working for...

602
00:58:31,036 --> 00:58:32,992
It's a Smith & Wesson.

603
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,996
And you've had your six.

604
00:58:53,153 --> 00:58:55,030
Better late than never.

605
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,391
- Everything ready?
- Yeah, for the last two hours.

606
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:03,195
Everything's going to be fine.

607
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,538
Bottom part of where my belly used to be
tells me different.

608
00:59:07,842 --> 00:59:10,516
For me, Crab Key will be
a gentle relaxation.

609
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:12,721
From what? Dames?

610
00:59:12,934 --> 00:59:14,527
No, from being a clay pigeon.

611
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,414
This is as far as we can go
with the engine.

612
00:59:47,655 --> 00:59:50,407
Make with paddle and wind
from now on in.

613
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:52,614
OK.

614
00:59:54,748 --> 00:59:56,340
Let me go with him.

615
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,262
No, we settled that. Anyhow, it's my beat.

616
00:59:59,505 --> 01:00:02,304
But it's my head in the noose
if anything gets unstuck.

617
01:00:02,677 --> 01:00:05,510
Canaveral can only wait 48 hours
for that moonshot.

618
01:00:05,766 --> 01:00:08,485
We'll be back in 12.
If not, then it's your beat.

619
01:00:08,728 --> 01:00:11,289
You'd better bring your Marines with you.

620
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:16,163
Hey, Quarrel, if you see a dragon,
get in first and breathe on him, you hear?

621
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:19,244
With all that rum in you, he'll die happy!

622
01:00:46,621 --> 01:00:49,771
Better drop the sail
in case their radar's on scan.

623
01:00:58,806 --> 01:01:00,762
Hard about, Captain... now!

624
01:01:29,813 --> 01:01:31,768
Cover it up.

625
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:34,750
We'd better get some sleep
before it gets light.

626
01:01:34,987 --> 01:01:36,943
I'll be down this end.

627
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:23,614
# Underneath the mango tree

628
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,981
# La-la la-la dee

629
01:02:26,202 --> 01:02:29,275
# Come watch for the moon

630
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:31,027
# La-la-da-da

631
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:34,168
# Mango tree, me honey and me

632
01:02:35,217 --> 01:02:37,172
# Make bu-lu-lup

633
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:40,583
# Underneath the mango tree...

634
01:02:42,143 --> 01:02:44,099
# Make bu-lu-lup soon

635
01:02:45,023 --> 01:02:49,175
# La-la-la dee-da-da... me honey and me

636
01:02:50,197 --> 01:02:52,552
# Underneath the mango tree

637
01:02:52,784 --> 01:02:54,661
# My honey and me...

638
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:56,827
Who is that?

639
01:03:02,634 --> 01:03:05,228
It's all right.
I'm not supposed to be here, either.

640
01:03:05,472 --> 01:03:07,702
I take it you're not. Are you alone?

641
01:03:07,934 --> 01:03:11,369
What are you doing here?
Looking for shells?

642
01:03:11,648 --> 01:03:13,842
No. I'm just looking.

643
01:03:14,068 --> 01:03:16,023
Stay where you are.

644
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:19,172
I promise I won't steal your shells.

645
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:21,128
I promise you you won't, either.

646
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:23,981
Stay where you are!

647
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:27,681
I can assure you,
my intentions are strictly honourable.

648
01:03:47,996 --> 01:03:49,952
What's your name?

649
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:51,527
Ryder.

650
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:52,824
Ryder what?

651
01:03:53,003 --> 01:03:54,958
Honey... Ryder.

652
01:03:56,175 --> 01:03:59,884
- What's so funny about it?
- Nothing. It's a very pretty name.

653
01:04:02,518 --> 01:04:04,474
What's your name?

654
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:06,686
James.

655
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:11,007
Honey, did you use your sail
all the way up to the reef here?

656
01:04:11,282 --> 01:04:13,398
Of course. I always do.

657
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:16,257
Then they'll know we're here.
They have radar.

658
01:04:16,498 --> 01:04:18,931
Oh, my boat is too small to be noticed.

659
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:21,945
And I often come here to get the shells.

660
01:04:22,172 --> 01:04:25,289
At first they used to try to catch me,
but they couldn't.

661
01:04:25,554 --> 01:04:29,467
- Now I don't think they bother any more.
- They will this time.

662
01:04:31,855 --> 01:04:34,972
- Don't bother with those now.
- Don't bother?

663
01:04:35,527 --> 01:04:37,278
Are they valuable?

664
01:04:37,489 --> 01:04:40,242
This one is worth $50 in Miami.

665
01:04:40,492 --> 01:04:42,244
50!

666
01:04:45,376 --> 01:04:47,650
You promise you won't tell anyone?

667
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,438
I promise.

668
01:04:49,632 --> 01:04:52,829
- Hey! Come and take a look!
- He's with me.

669
01:04:53,847 --> 01:04:56,121
Captain, what do you think of that!

670
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:00,978
What's the matter?

671
01:05:04,989 --> 01:05:08,378
That's a high-powered boat.
Take some cover! Come on!

672
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,916
They're here all right.

673
01:05:39,126 --> 01:05:41,958
OK, folks!
Come out and you won't get hurt!

674
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:45,547
Stand up and show yourselves

675
01:05:45,802 --> 01:05:47,918
or I'll be forced to open fire!

676
01:05:51,228 --> 01:05:52,376
Come on out!

677
01:05:52,563 --> 01:05:54,076
We know you're there!

678
01:05:54,273 --> 01:05:55,992
We've been expecting you!

679
01:05:56,193 --> 01:05:58,833
Just walk out with your hands up
and you'll be OK!

680
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,913
This is your last chance!

681
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:03,836
He's bluffing. Keep down.

682
01:06:04,706 --> 01:06:06,742
All right. You've been warned!

683
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:08,826
This is it!

684
01:06:09,005 --> 01:06:12,041
Lie still. It won't last long.
They don't know we're here.

685
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,257
Fire!

686
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:29,255
Are you coming out?

687
01:06:29,871 --> 01:06:31,384
All right, then.

688
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:33,485
We'll be back.

689
01:06:33,668 --> 01:06:35,623
We'll be back with the dogs!

690
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:37,190
Full speed ahead!

691
01:07:00,835 --> 01:07:02,268
I told you this place was wrong.

692
01:07:02,461 --> 01:07:06,137
- That was a machine gun, not a dragon.
- There's a dragon here, too.

693
01:07:06,427 --> 01:07:07,382
She's right.

694
01:07:07,554 --> 01:07:10,351
- You've seen it, hm?
- Yes, I have.

695
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:14,148
He had two glaring eyes,
a short tail and pointed wings.

696
01:07:14,438 --> 01:07:16,394
He was breathing fire.

697
01:07:17,152 --> 01:07:18,789
You don't believe me, do you?

698
01:07:18,987 --> 01:07:23,106
Little gal, I does.
Let's get the hell outta here.

699
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:26,847
Listen, both of you.
There are no such things as dragons.

700
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:31,641
What you saw was something that looked
like one. I'm trying to think what it was.

701
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:33,398
How do you know there aren't?

702
01:07:33,594 --> 01:07:37,347
What do you know about animals?
Did you ever see a mongoose dance?

703
01:07:37,641 --> 01:07:41,032
A scorpion with sunstroke
sting itself to death?

704
01:07:41,313 --> 01:07:44,271
Or a praying mantis
eat her husband after making love?

705
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:46,960
- I hate to admit it, but I haven't.
- Well, I have.

706
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:48,949
She's right.

707
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:53,634
All right, they've gone.
Honey, you're getting out of here.

708
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:56,909
I'm getting out when I'm ready.
That's never in daylight.

709
01:07:57,172 --> 01:07:59,208
This time you are, and fast.

710
01:07:59,425 --> 01:08:01,222
Where's your boat?

711
01:08:02,221 --> 01:08:04,211
Fetch my shoes.

712
01:08:11,777 --> 01:08:14,371
Look! Look what they've done!

713
01:08:14,615 --> 01:08:16,572
It's all your fault!

714
01:08:17,619 --> 01:08:21,851
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new boat
when we get back to Kingston.

715
01:08:22,211 --> 01:08:25,088
What are we going to do with her now?

716
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:28,332
If you like,
I know a good place where we can hide.

717
01:08:28,595 --> 01:08:31,347
That'll do for a start.
Leave the things you don't need.

718
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,555
All right, all right.

719
01:08:56,322 --> 01:09:00,600
- Must we come this way?
- Yes. It throws the dogs off the scent.

720
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:05,489
- Damn mosquitoes!
- Rub water all over yourself.

721
01:09:05,836 --> 01:09:07,792
It's the salt they're after.

722
01:09:12,305 --> 01:09:16,344
Hey...! Quick! They's coming!
Across there!

723
01:09:19,983 --> 01:09:23,418
Quarrel, cut some of those reeds.
Give me the knife.

724
01:09:23,905 --> 01:09:25,862
Over there.

725
01:09:37,135 --> 01:09:39,091
They're coming closer.

726
01:09:39,305 --> 01:09:40,738
- Aiee!
- Keep quiet.

727
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:42,126
Something's biting me!

728
01:09:42,309 --> 01:09:45,061
If you disturb the mud,
they'll know we've been here.

729
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,880
- Looks like they're onto something.
- Sh!

730
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,131
Ssh!

731
01:10:57,341 --> 01:10:59,297
Get down, get down!

732
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:39,078
- Why?
- Because I had to.

733
01:11:39,323 --> 01:11:43,110
That guy sure knew his business,
trailing us after we let the others pass.

734
01:11:43,412 --> 01:11:45,608
Where is this hiding place of yours?

735
01:11:45,832 --> 01:11:46,868
Up there.

736
01:11:49,588 --> 01:11:50,623
Come on.

737
01:12:02,108 --> 01:12:04,257
You smell nicer already.

738
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,985
Oh, thank you.

739
01:12:07,533 --> 01:12:09,488
Mr Bond! Quick!

740
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:14,134
- What is it now?
- Look at these!

741
01:12:17,923 --> 01:12:19,880
Those are dragon tracks!

742
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:22,912
Look! That's where he breathed!

743
01:12:23,265 --> 01:12:26,019
Captain, you ought to get some rest
if you wants to.

744
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:28,626
I stay out here... on watch...

745
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:31,212
in case he comes a-looking for us.

746
01:12:31,444 --> 01:12:33,720
Right, and I'll take the second watch.

747
01:12:35,033 --> 01:12:37,149
We'll be out of here by midnight.

748
01:12:40,376 --> 01:12:42,650
I never met a detective before.

749
01:12:43,965 --> 01:12:46,081
Are you going to arrest Dr No?

750
01:12:46,301 --> 01:12:51,056
Someone is. We can't have him trying
to kill everyone who comes here.

751
01:12:51,393 --> 01:12:53,189
He doesn't just try.

752
01:12:53,395 --> 01:12:56,307
- Mm?
- I'm pretty sure he killed my father.

753
01:12:56,567 --> 01:12:57,521
What?

754
01:12:57,694 --> 01:13:01,368
You see,
my father was a marine zoologist.

755
01:13:01,658 --> 01:13:05,048
We came to the Caribbean
for him to study seashells.

756
01:13:05,331 --> 01:13:07,367
One day he came to Crab Key,...

757
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,494
..and I never saw him again.

758
01:13:09,712 --> 01:13:12,226
They said he must have drowned,

759
01:13:12,466 --> 01:13:15,663
but he was too good a diver
for that to happen to him.

760
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,524
Didn't the police investigate?
And your family?

761
01:13:18,768 --> 01:13:21,362
They investigated for a long time.

762
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:24,529
Then they said
"Missing, presumed dead".

763
01:13:24,778 --> 01:13:27,735
I haven't got any family.
There was only my father and me.

764
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:29,548
You're here all alone?

765
01:13:29,743 --> 01:13:31,779
Where did you live before?

766
01:13:31,997 --> 01:13:33,715
All over the world.

767
01:13:33,917 --> 01:13:36,146
The Philippines, Bali, Hawaii.

768
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:38,051
Anywhere there were shells.

769
01:13:38,256 --> 01:13:40,087
You went to school somewhere?

770
01:13:40,301 --> 01:13:43,260
I didn't need to. We had an encyclopedia.

771
01:13:43,515 --> 01:13:46,506
I started at A when I was eight,
and now I've reached T.

772
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:49,283
I bet I know a lot more things than you do.

773
01:13:51,444 --> 01:13:53,798
Didn't anyone in Kingston help?

774
01:13:54,614 --> 01:13:59,369
Well... there was this man who owned
the place where we were living.

775
01:13:59,707 --> 01:14:02,539
He let me stay on
for a while without paying.

776
01:14:03,128 --> 01:14:05,643
Then one night he came up to my room...

777
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:07,828
Well, you know.

778
01:14:08,804 --> 01:14:11,556
I scratched his face, and then...

779
01:14:11,809 --> 01:14:13,765
But he was stronger than I was.

780
01:14:13,979 --> 01:14:15,617
What happened after that?

781
01:14:17,567 --> 01:14:21,195
I put a black-widow spider
underneath his mosquito net.

782
01:14:21,948 --> 01:14:24,064
A female, and they're the worst.

783
01:14:24,453 --> 01:14:26,408
It took him a whole week to die.

784
01:14:29,711 --> 01:14:30,746
Did I do wrong?

785
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,012
Well, it wouldn't do to make a habit of it.

786
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,686
Do you have a woman of your own?

787
01:14:43,274 --> 01:14:44,912
Captain, quick! Down here!

788
01:14:46,444 --> 01:14:49,198
Whatever's coming, it's coming this way!

789
01:14:49,658 --> 01:14:51,967
This time I want to see it.

790
01:14:52,412 --> 01:14:54,926
And hurry!
There's less than 12 hours to go!

791
01:15:20,492 --> 01:15:22,005
Stay where you are!

792
01:15:22,203 --> 01:15:24,636
All ofyou! Stay right where you are!

793
01:15:36,307 --> 01:15:39,105
OK, Captain.
If that ain't a dragon, what is it?

794
01:15:39,354 --> 01:15:41,025
A dragon that runs on diesel.

795
01:15:41,231 --> 01:15:46,067
Forget the spooks, Quarrel. You take the
driver. I'll take the headlights and tyres.

796
01:15:46,407 --> 01:15:47,840
You keep safe out of sight.

797
01:15:48,033 --> 01:15:49,182
Come on.

798
01:16:24,757 --> 01:16:26,475
I told you to stay there!

799
01:16:26,676 --> 01:16:28,632
- I was frightened.
- Get down!

800
01:16:43,996 --> 01:16:46,385
Come on out!
Hands where we can see 'em!

801
01:16:49,128 --> 01:16:51,119
And the dame! Quick!

802
01:16:51,591 --> 01:16:53,627
Unless you want an extra navel.

803
01:16:56,556 --> 01:16:58,309
Hold it. Drop that gun.

804
01:17:00,311 --> 01:17:02,268
Now kick it away from you.

805
01:17:04,277 --> 01:17:08,634
The girl will stay where she is.
Now walk towards me, hands out in front.

806
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,461
Come on!

807
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,398
Hey, you!
Where do you think you're going!

808
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:28,471
Sorry we ain't got any flowers.
Come on, let's go.

809
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:31,324
Come on. Come on, let's go!

810
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:38,145
Give me that knife.

811
01:17:51,641 --> 01:17:53,074
Leave him alone!

812
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:55,703
- Leave him alone!
- Get out of the way!

813
01:18:11,807 --> 01:18:13,161
Get inside!

814
01:18:13,351 --> 01:18:15,307
Keep an eye on the man.

815
01:18:15,898 --> 01:18:20,255
And be careful. They've been
in the swamp and they're contaminated.

816
01:18:23,283 --> 01:18:25,239
Check their Geiger reading.

817
01:18:32,465 --> 01:18:34,261
He's reading 95, Chief.

818
01:18:34,467 --> 01:18:35,742
She's 88.

819
01:18:35,929 --> 01:18:39,204
Too much for the monitor.
Scrub them down, but quick!

820
01:18:51,744 --> 01:18:53,382
Do another reading.

821
01:19:02,051 --> 01:19:05,010
- Reading 72.8.
- The mud's soaked into their clothes.

822
01:19:05,265 --> 01:19:07,541
All right, then. Take off all their clothes.

823
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:11,159
- What's he going to do?
- Do as he says. We're contaminated.

824
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:14,354
- Do the girl first.
- We give the orders around here.

825
01:19:14,613 --> 01:19:18,368
Fine, but do something about this.
Come here, you. Here.

826
01:19:20,247 --> 01:19:23,204
Use the high-temperature jets.
Full pressure.

827
01:19:31,389 --> 01:19:33,345
68.

828
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:38,805
- She's reading 47.
- All right. Put the man through.

829
01:19:40,278 --> 01:19:42,234
He's now clocking 40.

830
01:19:43,032 --> 01:19:44,988
Stages three and five.

831
01:19:45,494 --> 01:19:47,725
Reading 38.

832
01:19:48,957 --> 01:19:50,913
32.

833
01:19:51,252 --> 01:19:53,641
- Down to 8.
- Hold the girl.

834
01:19:56,345 --> 01:19:58,301
He's now 18.

835
01:20:01,394 --> 01:20:03,350
He's now at 8.

836
01:20:06,819 --> 01:20:09,252
- She's clear.
- Good. Get the man ready.

837
01:20:15,248 --> 01:20:17,001
He's got a count of four.

838
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:20,440
- Check his fingernails.
- Put your hands in there.

839
01:20:21,048 --> 01:20:22,323
He's OK.

840
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:25,104
I will notify reception
they're coming through.

841
01:20:26,224 --> 01:20:29,454
Decontamination here.
They're coming through.

842
01:20:57,266 --> 01:20:58,461
Come in.

843
01:20:58,644 --> 01:21:00,600
Come in!

844
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:03,122
Come in... you poor dears.

845
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:06,082
We simply didn't know
when to expect you.

846
01:21:06,322 --> 01:21:09,314
First it was teatime yesterday,
and then dinner.

847
01:21:09,577 --> 01:21:12,569
It was only half an hour ago
we knew you were on your way.

848
01:21:12,832 --> 01:21:15,948
Cigarette? American, English, or Turkish?

849
01:21:16,212 --> 01:21:20,569
I'm Sister Rose. This is Sister Lily. We'll
make your stay as pleasant as possible.

850
01:21:20,886 --> 01:21:22,797
That's most kind of you, but...

851
01:21:23,015 --> 01:21:26,564
Oh, you'll want to see your rooms!
Breakfast is ready,

852
01:21:26,854 --> 01:21:29,208
and then you'll want to sleep.

853
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:36,021
The doctor left strict orders you're
not to be disturbed until this evening.

854
01:21:36,327 --> 01:21:38,521
He'll be delighted
if you join him for dinner.

855
01:21:38,747 --> 01:21:41,579
- Will you be there?
- Tell him I also will be delighted.

856
01:21:41,836 --> 01:21:43,872
Splendid. I know he'll be pleased.

857
01:21:44,088 --> 01:21:46,045
Here we are.

858
01:21:48,261 --> 01:21:50,377
This will be your room, Mr Bond.

859
01:21:52,435 --> 01:21:54,390
This is your bathroom in here.

860
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:57,186
And for you, young lady,

861
01:21:57,985 --> 01:21:59,942
this is your room.

862
01:22:02,993 --> 01:22:05,268
You'll find fresh clothes in here.

863
01:22:08,292 --> 01:22:12,206
I hope they fit.
We didn't get your sizes till last night.

864
01:22:12,507 --> 01:22:15,658
Don't hesitate to ring
if there's anything you want.

865
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:18,046
Such as two air tickets to London?

866
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,154
I'll leave you two dear people in peace.

867
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:41,185
- Well, let's have some breakfast.
- How can you eat at a time like this?

868
01:22:41,511 --> 01:22:45,345
I'm hungry. We don't know when
we'll get the chance to eat again.

869
01:22:45,641 --> 01:22:46,994
Here, take this.

870
01:22:47,185 --> 01:22:51,497
Careful. The whole place
is probably wired for sound.

871
01:23:01,917 --> 01:23:03,670
Have you...

872
01:23:04,087 --> 01:23:07,159
Have you any idea
what they'll do with us?

873
01:23:07,426 --> 01:23:09,381
No idea.

874
01:23:10,096 --> 01:23:12,452
No door handles or windows, either.

875
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:17,243
It's a prison, then.

876
01:23:17,442 --> 01:23:20,114
Mink-lined with first-class service.

877
01:23:24,284 --> 01:23:26,240
What's the matter?

878
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:29,496
I don't feel so good.

879
01:23:31,505 --> 01:23:33,461
I feel so sleepy.

880
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,969
Damn coffee!

881
01:24:53,465 --> 01:24:55,421
How do you feel?

882
01:24:57,554 --> 01:24:59,510
Sleepy.

883
01:25:00,725 --> 01:25:02,761
What made us pass out like that?

884
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:04,976
The coffee was drugged.

885
01:25:10,533 --> 01:25:13,889
It's time for dinner.
We don't want to keep the doctor waiting.

886
01:25:14,162 --> 01:25:15,881
That would never do. Ready, Honey?

887
01:25:18,545 --> 01:25:19,978
I suppose so.

888
01:25:25,264 --> 01:25:27,220
You're doing fine.

889
01:25:30,939 --> 01:25:32,895
Come on.

890
01:25:33,527 --> 01:25:36,041
Am I properly dressed for the occasion?

891
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,795
- Quite suitable.
- Suitable for what?

892
01:25:52,012 --> 01:25:53,969
This way, please.

893
01:25:57,479 --> 01:25:59,630
I'm glad your hands are sweating, too.

894
01:25:59,859 --> 01:26:01,655
Of course I'm scared, too.

895
01:26:01,862 --> 01:26:04,614
Be natural and leave all the talking to me.

896
01:26:04,867 --> 01:26:06,823
In here, please.

897
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:09,033
I hope you enjoy your dinner.

898
01:27:05,158 --> 01:27:07,114
Come and look!

899
01:27:16,551 --> 01:27:20,623
Artificial light. We could be
hundreds of feet beneath the sea.

900
01:27:20,932 --> 01:27:22,685
Look at that. Sea tulips.

901
01:27:22,894 --> 01:27:24,770
They do not grow above 200ft.

902
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:27,574
One million dollars, Mr Bond.

903
01:27:28,694 --> 01:27:30,605
You were wondering what it cost.

904
01:27:30,823 --> 01:27:32,574
As a matter of fact, I was.

905
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:44,130
Forgive my not shaking hands.
It's awkward with these. A misfortune.

906
01:27:44,427 --> 01:27:46,703
You were admiring my aquarium.

907
01:27:48,516 --> 01:27:50,587
Yes. It's quite impressive.

908
01:27:50,811 --> 01:27:54,565
A unique feat of engineering,
if I may say so. I designed it myself.

909
01:27:54,859 --> 01:27:59,137
The glass is convex, ten inches thick,
which accounts for the magnifying effect.

910
01:27:59,451 --> 01:28:04,161
Minnows pretending they're whales.
Just like you on this island, Dr No.

911
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,456
It depends, Mr Bond,

912
01:28:06,712 --> 01:28:09,067
on which side of the glass you are.

913
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:13,076
A medium dry martini, lemon peel,
shaken, not stirred.

914
01:28:13,346 --> 01:28:15,702
- Vodka?
- Of course.

915
01:28:16,644 --> 01:28:18,600
We'll have dinner at once.

916
01:28:19,564 --> 01:28:22,398
There's so much to discuss. So little time.

917
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,399
Well, Dr No, you haven't done badly,
considering.

918
01:28:48,648 --> 01:28:50,717
A handicap is what you make of it.

919
01:28:50,943 --> 01:28:53,775
I was the unwanted child
of a German missionary

920
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:56,180
and a Chinese girl of good family.

921
01:28:56,409 --> 01:29:00,881
Yet I became treasurer of the most
powerful criminal society in China.

922
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:05,805
It's rare for the Tongs to trust anyone
who isn't completely Chinese.

923
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:08,213
I doubt they shall do so again.

924
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:12,509
I escaped to America
with ten million of their dollars in gold.

925
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:15,448
That's how you financed this operation.

926
01:29:15,689 --> 01:29:19,203
A good idea to use atomic power.
I'm glad you can handle it properly.

927
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:24,640
I'd hate to think your decontamination
chamber wasn't effective.

928
01:29:24,994 --> 01:29:29,033
My work has given me
a unique knowledge of radioactivity,

929
01:29:29,335 --> 01:29:31,974
but not without costs, as you see.

930
01:29:32,756 --> 01:29:34,429
Yes.

931
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:39,755
Your power source had
our organisation puzzled for some time.

932
01:29:40,144 --> 01:29:42,100
They are still puzzled, Mr Bond.

933
01:29:42,314 --> 01:29:44,908
Not any longer. I sent a complete report.

934
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:49,827
You've not contacted your headquarters
since you requested a Geiger counter.

935
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:53,753
But there are so many files
open on you already, Dr No.

936
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:56,421
Our own, the CIA's...

937
01:29:57,671 --> 01:30:00,707
The one from the Tong society
that you robbed.

938
01:30:00,967 --> 01:30:04,676
When trouble comes, you'll find
this is a small and naked island.

939
01:30:04,974 --> 01:30:07,168
An expendable island.

940
01:30:07,394 --> 01:30:10,750
When my mission is accomplished,
I'll destroy it and move on.

941
01:30:11,024 --> 01:30:15,381
But the habit of enquiry is consistent.
I see you're wondering why, where, when.

942
01:30:15,698 --> 01:30:18,770
I gratify your curiosity
because you're the one man

943
01:30:19,037 --> 01:30:21,311
capable of appreciating what I've done

944
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:25,025
and keeping it to himself.

945
01:30:26,047 --> 01:30:31,327
Just a minute. There's no point
in involving the girl at this stage.

946
01:30:31,681 --> 01:30:34,594
Let her go free. She'll promise not to talk.

947
01:30:34,853 --> 01:30:37,492
- No, I'm staying with you.
- I don't want you here.

948
01:30:37,733 --> 01:30:40,167
I agree. This is no place for the girl.

949
01:30:40,444 --> 01:30:42,400
Take her away.

950
01:30:43,617 --> 01:30:44,572
No!

951
01:30:45,703 --> 01:30:46,818
No!

952
01:30:46,997 --> 01:30:51,194
- I'm sure the guards will amuse her.
- Let me go! No!

953
01:30:53,090 --> 01:30:56,798
That's a Dom Pérignon '55.
It would be a pity to break it.

954
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,279
I prefer the '53 myself.

955
01:31:05,943 --> 01:31:08,854
Clumsy effort, Mr Bond.
You disappoint me.

956
01:31:09,113 --> 01:31:11,069
I'm not a fool,

957
01:31:11,283 --> 01:31:15,755
so please do not treat me as one.
And that table knife, please put it back.

958
01:31:18,587 --> 01:31:20,817
Well, we can't all be geniuses, can we?

959
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:26,328
Does the toppling of American missiles
really compensate for having no hands?

960
01:31:26,682 --> 01:31:30,153
Missiles are only the first step
to prove our power.

961
01:31:30,439 --> 01:31:35,194
Our power? Your disregard for human life
means you must be working for the East.

962
01:31:35,529 --> 01:31:39,204
East, West - just points of the compass,
each as stupid as the other.

963
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,610
I'm a member of SPECTRE.

964
01:31:41,832 --> 01:31:43,150
- SPECTRE?
- SPECTRE.

965
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:48,533
Special Executive for Counterintelligence,
Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.

966
01:31:48,884 --> 01:31:53,162
The four cornerstones of power, headed
by the greatest brains in the world.

967
01:31:53,475 --> 01:31:55,829
Correction. Criminal brains.

968
01:31:56,061 --> 01:31:59,895
The successful criminal brain
is always superior. It has to be.

969
01:32:00,193 --> 01:32:01,989
Well, why become criminal?

970
01:32:02,195 --> 01:32:05,949
I'm sure the West would welcome
a scientist of your... calibre.

971
01:32:06,912 --> 01:32:10,221
The Americans are fools.
I offered my services. They refused.

972
01:32:10,501 --> 01:32:14,813
So did the East.
Now they can both pay for their mistake.

973
01:32:15,132 --> 01:32:19,126
World domination. That same old dream.

974
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:23,470
Our asylums are full of people
who think they're Napoleon... or God.

975
01:32:28,737 --> 01:32:31,649
You persist in trying to provoke me,
Mr Bond.

976
01:32:31,908 --> 01:32:35,378
- I could've had you killed in the swamp.
- And why didn't you?

977
01:32:36,832 --> 01:32:41,224
I thought you less stupid.
Usually, when a man gets in my way...

978
01:32:46,055 --> 01:32:48,854
But you were different.
You cost me time, money,

979
01:32:49,101 --> 01:32:51,695
effort. You damaged my organisation

980
01:32:51,939 --> 01:32:53,292
and my pride.

981
01:32:53,484 --> 01:32:56,282
I was curious to see
what kind of a man you were.

982
01:32:56,529 --> 01:32:59,203
I thought there might be a place
for you with SPECTRE.

983
01:32:59,451 --> 01:33:01,487
I'm flattered.

984
01:33:01,704 --> 01:33:04,457
I'd prefer the revenge department.

985
01:33:05,668 --> 01:33:11,664
My first job would be finding the man
who killed Strangways and Quarrel.

986
01:33:12,054 --> 01:33:15,329
I misjudged you.
You are just a stupid policeman

987
01:33:18,439 --> 01:33:20,872
whose luck has run out.

988
01:33:21,444 --> 01:33:24,753
They're waiting for you
in the control room, Dr No.

989
01:33:25,033 --> 01:33:28,627
No hurry. They won't have started
their countdown check yet.

990
01:33:28,913 --> 01:33:34,146
You won't get away with it, Dr No. The
Americans are prepared for any trouble.

991
01:33:35,798 --> 01:33:38,266
I never fail, Mr Bond.

992
01:33:38,511 --> 01:33:40,229
What do we do with him?

993
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:43,502
Soften him up.
I haven't finished with him yet.

994
01:36:09,155 --> 01:36:10,110
Aagh!

995
01:39:24,184 --> 01:39:26,698
Have you got new fuel elements loaded?

996
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:29,060
All ready, sir.

997
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:35,118
The roadblock is about 3,000ft away.

998
01:39:35,368 --> 01:39:37,962
Everyone is pulled back.
No traffic allowed.

999
01:39:38,206 --> 01:39:40,800
The launch area is completely cleared...

1000
01:39:51,851 --> 01:39:55,002
The vehicle is now
at its full weight of240 tons.

1001
01:39:55,274 --> 01:39:59,233
All the automatic transistors
have been put onto the vehicle.

1002
01:39:59,529 --> 01:40:01,885
We will run up
to half power for 30 seconds.

1003
01:40:06,123 --> 01:40:08,079
Control interlocks free.

1004
01:40:08,293 --> 01:40:10,250
Fuel elements 12.5.

1005
01:40:30,202 --> 01:40:31,237
Control?

1006
01:40:31,412 --> 01:40:36,088
Control rod actuators operating.
Core temperature 1 1 3.

1007
01:40:36,753 --> 01:40:37,903
Converters?

1008
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:41,082
Converters standing by.
Ignition heaters on.

1009
01:40:41,845 --> 01:40:43,801
Radiation?

1010
01:40:44,181 --> 01:40:47,253
Counters 121 , 141 , 109.

1011
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,671
- Energy stabilisers?
- Energy steady...

1012
01:40:50,943 --> 01:40:55,891
The tracking stations are plugged into
the control centre at Cape Canaveral.

1013
01:40:56,243 --> 01:40:57,391
Fuel elements?

1014
01:40:57,578 --> 01:41:00,967
- We'rejust checking...
- Fuel elements! Where's Chang?

1015
01:41:02,167 --> 01:41:05,557
Chang! What are you doing there?!
Get on the gantry!

1016
01:41:08,595 --> 01:41:09,823
Hurry!

1017
01:41:16,774 --> 01:41:19,606
- Shut down.
- Shut down reactor!

1018
01:41:28,461 --> 01:41:31,850
This is Mercury Control.
Countdown for...

1019
01:41:32,132 --> 01:41:35,488
Reactor shutdown,
temperature 227, falling.

1020
01:41:36,055 --> 01:41:38,251
- Converters off.
- Converters off.

1021
01:41:38,476 --> 01:41:42,230
- Radiation reading.
- Radiation zero.

1022
01:41:42,817 --> 01:41:44,454
Shutdown procedure complete.

1023
01:41:44,653 --> 01:41:46,564
Reactor safe.

1024
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:48,533
Last fuelling control has been made.

1025
01:41:48,742 --> 01:41:50,333
Stand by.

1026
01:41:50,537 --> 01:41:53,256
We stay on Mercury Control
for the countdown.

1027
01:41:53,500 --> 01:42:00,099
This is Mercury Control. The check
indicates all systems are go at this time.
