1
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,640
As feudal Japan enjoys peace,
the samurai era is waning.


2
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:44,868
But this fragile calm is threatened by
the growing power of Lord Naritsugu,


3
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:47,566
the Shogun's sadistic younger brother.


4
00:00:47,752 --> 00:00:49,915
Sir Doi realizes
Naritsugu will ruin the Shogunate


5
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,540
if he gains higher political standing.


6
00:00:52,722 --> 00:00:54,771
As Naritsugu's evil deeds are
quickly hushed up, Sir Doi must act.


7
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:47,305
March 5, 1844 - Akashi Clan House Elder
Zusho Mamiya commits harakiri.


8
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:53,341
Mamiya's harakiri to the Shogun
was against Lord Naritsugu.

9
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:56,241
Lord Naritsugu was born
with a vicious nature.


10
00:02:56,533 --> 00:03:02,600
His lust for flesh and
dishonorable conduct cannot be pardoned.


11
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:04,687
What should we do?


12
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,543
Shogun Council Elders,
Sir Doi has returned.


13
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:33,400
The Shogun orders us to settle
the matter of his half-brother quietly.


14
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,472
SIR DOI
Top Shogun official


15
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:45,277
We blame those that named Naritsugu
an adopted Akashi son.


16
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:50,283
This dilemma drove Mamiya
to harakiri...


17
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:55,087
- His appeal to us for action...
- I´m aware of that!


18
00:03:55,288 --> 00:04:00,961
But we must respect the Shogun's rule.


19
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:05,598
His justice is noble
by heaven's will.


20
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,370
Arguing is pointless!


21
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:44,470
Shinzaemon Shimada, I presume?


22
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:46,639
In the flesh.


23
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:51,543
You're a hard man to find.


24
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,379
13 ASSASSINS.
subtitles by KNIGHT.


25
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:12,088
Sir Doi.


26
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:15,559
Sorry for the late hour.


27
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,029
I've been a widower for years,
with few family obligations.


28
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,766
SHINZAEMON
Shogun Samurai


29
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:28,237
Perharps you've heard about the outrage.


30
00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:30,874
I have.


31
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,245
So...


32
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:41,550
What do you make of Lord Naritsugu?


33
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:48,792
Forgive my frankness...


34
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:53,629
He is no worthy heir
to the noble Akashi clan.


35
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:59,970
With the Shogun's consent,
I suggest Naritsugu steps down.


36
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,939
A more suitable heir is needed.


37
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:07,444
The Shogun will not grant it.


38
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:10,713
Why not?


39
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:18,422
He has appointed Naritsugu
as his senior advisor,


40
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:22,559
effective on Naritsugu's next visit
to Edo.


41
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,000
The Shogun will allow that boy
to meddle in political affairs?


42
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:33,137
Incidentally, I invited someone here...


43
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:36,673
Speak with him.


44
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:56,893
I'm Yukie Makino,
a subject of Lord of Owari.


45
00:06:57,093 --> 00:06:59,963
I serve the Agematsu in Kiso.


46
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:02,197
I'm Shinzaemon Shimada.


47
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,134
Kiso?


48
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:11,173
I heard about an incident last year
between the Akashi and Owari clams.


49
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:13,310
Rumors of a scandal...


50
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:19,682
I'll tell you all.
I'll keep no secrets.


51
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:25,055
In April of last year...


52
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:31,161
Lord Naritsugu of the Akashi clan...


53
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,733
stayed overnight at Kiso.


54
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,483
He is the son of the former Shogun.


55
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:44,403
LORD NARlTSUGU
The head of the Akashi clan.


56
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:46,742
Nobility must be properly served...


57
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:54,183
Our wives and daughters were
brought in for his full hospitality.


58
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:01,391
Uneme.


59
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:03,026
Father.


60
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:05,394
- Is his feast in order?
- Yes.


61
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:08,398
And the picture scrolls
for his entertainment?


62
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:09,932
I'll fetch them.


63
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:12,769
Have your wife get them instead.


64
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,709
Chise.


65
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:27,918
My son had married Chise
only two months prior.


66
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:31,687
I ordered her to do this petty task.


67
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:36,326
And I'll regret it to my grave.


68
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,634
Who might you be?


69
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:49,239
I belong to the Uneme Makino family.


70
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:56,312
My Lord, please release me.


71
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:10,125
Chise!


72
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:14,831
Chise?


73
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:42,792
Kiso women are such mountain monkeys.


74
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:47,163
They defy me by scratching.


75
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:57,374
Are you a monkey too, servant?

76
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:53,028
Monkey necks can be so tough.

77
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:01,238
That same night...


78
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:06,442
Chise slit her throat in disgrace.


79
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:13,250
My son and his new bride slain...


80
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,453
before my very eyes.


81
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:24,894
This is torture.


82
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:29,231
Rather than living in disgrace
I ponder harakiri.


83
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:34,770
But I can't... I remember the shame
my Lord Owari has endured.


84
00:11:37,874 --> 00:11:40,476
Mock me for grumbling.


85
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:47,683
I continue my worthless life solely
to remain a living witness to this tragedy.


86
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:56,359
As the Council Elder
enacting the Shogun's justice...


87
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,597
some things I can do, others I cannot.


88
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:09,172
If I turn my back on the Shogun
and find fault with his lineage,


89
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:16,645
then his rule will spiral into chaos
and destroy years of peace.


90
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:25,455
As the Shogun's senior advisor,
I cannot do it.


91
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:33,028
Are you asking if I can do something?


92
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:37,100
Since Mamiya's harakiri protest
three days ago...


93
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:43,139
I've searched my soul for a solution.


94
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:53,649
I have decided it's you.


95
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,844
Who's the woman?


96
00:13:21,043 --> 00:13:26,416
Akashi land was once most fertile.


97
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:31,955
But Naritsugu's relentless land taxes


98
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:37,460
made starving peasants hunger
for revolt.


99
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:40,730
This woman...


100
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:46,570
is the daughter of the peasant leader.


101
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:57,913
He did this...


102
00:13:58,114 --> 00:14:04,620
He cut off her limbs.


103
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:10,493
And brought heer to Edo
as his plaything.


104
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:16,765
But he grew bored with her
and cast her out.


105
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:26,241
Is there no mercy?


106
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:39,355
Shinzaemon, I need not mention
my honor and position.


107
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:46,562
If this continues, chaos will ruin
our nation and the people will suffer.


108
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:56,572
Poor woman...
What of your family's fate?


109
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,994
He cut out her tongue as well.


110
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:38,422
TOTAL MASSACRE


111
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:56,365
How fate smiles on me.


112
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:06,208
As a samurai in this era of peace...


113
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:09,678
I've been wishing for a noble death.

114
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,115
Now fate has called me here.


115
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:23,192
See, my hands won't stop trembling.


116
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:34,336
It's a warrior's battle shakes.


117
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,828
I will accomplish your wish...


118
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:03,765
with magnificence.


119
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,635
Sir Hanbei, thank you for coming.


120
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:30,471
HANBEI
Naritsugu's Chief Samurai


121
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:34,541
- Asakawa, where is Lord Naritsugu?
- Ah, the Great Hall table.


122
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:40,647
The Mamiya?


123
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:45,619
I told you not to trouble
the Mamiya family!


124
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:48,756
I can't disobey Lord Naritsugu's orders.


125
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:08,710
My Lord!


126
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:12,480
Yes, Hanbei?


127
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,618
Sir Doi has humbly requested that you
leave the Mamiya family alone...


128
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:20,121
Governmental orders!


129
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,157
Doi again!
That grumbling Shogun advisor.


130
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:25,792
Lord Naritsugu!


131
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:37,736
What makes a Samurai warrior?


132
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:43,010
You men mindlessly chant
"loyalty, duty"...


133
00:18:43,211 --> 00:18:45,179
like a Buddhist prayer.


134
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:48,482
But if servants are spoiled,


135
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:52,086
then one day, they forget their duty
to serve.


136
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:57,325
Servants like Mamiya make light
of their master and revolt.


137
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:03,163
Punishing one's servants,


138
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,267
who are certified as property
by the Shogun...


139
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:10,605
Punishment is a master's duty.


140
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:20,013
Dying for one's master
is the way of the Samurai.


141
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:25,353
Dying for one's husband
is the way of women.


142
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:41,536
We must protect these ways,
right, Hanbei?


143
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:46,708
Yes.


144
00:19:47,976 --> 00:19:50,612
They won't let him get away with it.


145
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:54,648
Things worked out too easily
for our Lord, don't you think?


146
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:57,551
He was given special treatment.


147
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:04,259
Though born of a different mother,
he is still the Shogun's brother.


148
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:38,163
So how will Sir Doi save face?


149
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:43,468
As the man in charge of
the nation's justice...


150
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:51,241
he must deliver a verdict to
save his honor in a scandal like this.


151
00:21:11,544 --> 00:21:15,847
So, Sir Doi is plotting something?

152
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,451
Who goes there?


153
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:23,723
Attendant Deguchi at your service.


154
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:30,396
Gather men and spy on Sir Doi.


155
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:34,233
Bribe the gatekeepers and servants.


156
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:40,641
Get his list of visitors
since Mamiya's harakiri.


157
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:48,048
We protect our Lord at all costs.


158
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:53,921
Such is our duty.


159
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:05,926
Yukie Makino of the Owari clan?


160
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:09,529
Owari?


161
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,965
Makino?


162
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:16,304
Makino was present
during our Kiso visit.


163
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:22,076
So Makino met with Shinzaemon.


164
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,646
Do you know this Shinzaemon?


165
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:33,086
We attended the same school, even
trained in the sword at the same dojo.


166
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:36,390
We were competitive classmates.


167
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,859
Is he that skilled?


168
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:43,564
He's not as shrewd, not as strong.


169
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:46,366
But he never gives up.


170
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,471
Backed into a corner, he won't budge.
Won't overplay his hand.


171
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:56,210
He's a man who beats you in the end.


172
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:01,695
If Doi has picked him...


173
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:07,320
then we've drawn the worst luck.


174
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:38,835
Impressive as always, Hirayama.


175
00:23:39,813 --> 00:23:44,957
I'm sorry for always borrowing
your dojo without permission.


176
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:51,372
You honor me by using it.
Your spirit keeps the dojo alive.


177
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,701
A match for old time's sake?


178
00:23:55,736 --> 00:24:00,040
Better to save our energy
for bigger tasks, right?


179
00:24:01,142 --> 00:24:06,180
There are no big or small tasks.
All are equally important.


180
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:15,655
You follow me?


181
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:19,559
Guess you still lack training.


182
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:27,201
Since your teaching, I have been on
the path of the sword for ten years.


183
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,740
As the months and seasons changed...


184
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,978
I lived on the money you gave me
as a sword for hire...


185
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:42,415
knowing that, one day,
I'd surrender my life to you.


186
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:48,890
I thought a time would come
when I could repay you.


187
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:54,761
Yet I have no choice but to regret...


188
00:24:54,961 --> 00:25:00,134
I have not been able to
repay you, master.


189
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:06,807
Your appreciation...

190
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:11,311
My small contribution
means so much?


191
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:15,583
I thank you.


192
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:19,586
What a rare samurai in these times!


193
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:22,022
Oh, Kuranaga!


194
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,929
I'm Hirayama.


195
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:45,564
We can't waste his spirit.


196
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:48,267
Have him join us.


197
00:25:56,976 --> 00:26:01,980
I chose five of my men.
They await you inside.


198
00:26:07,854 --> 00:26:12,325
Mitsuhashi, get acquainted
with Hirayama.


199
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:19,164
I am Mitsuhashi,
at your service.


200
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,673
I present my subordinates,
Otake and Hioki.


201
00:26:28,074 --> 00:26:32,778
And my men, Higuchi and Horii.


202
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:36,949
Hand-picked from hundreds.


203
00:26:37,982 --> 00:26:41,186
We are still few.


204
00:26:42,087 --> 00:26:46,726
It's hard to find skilled samurai
in this day and age.


205
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:52,731
Others are samurai of little worth.


206
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:59,372
Our five lives are in your hands,
Sir Shinzaemon.


207
00:26:59,572 --> 00:27:02,008
I see.


208
00:27:03,175 --> 00:27:09,115
Then listen up.
By private order of Sir Doi...


209
00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:15,954
we've been assigned to take the life
of Lord Naritsugu of the Akashi clan.


210
00:27:22,094 --> 00:27:27,732
Next month, Naritsugu will leave Edo
for the Akashi domain.


211
00:27:28,934 --> 00:27:32,572
If he enters Akashi land,
we can't touch him.


212
00:27:32,771 --> 00:27:35,141
So we strike en route?


213
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:41,713
That's the plan. It's absurd
with so little time and few men.


214
00:27:41,913 --> 00:27:48,954
But these days, how many samurai
use their swords in actual battle?


215
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:54,093
Not them, not us.
A real challenge.


216
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:59,298
He who values his life dies
a dog´s death.


217
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,269
You've entrusted me with you lives.


218
00:28:04,303 --> 00:28:09,107
I'll spend them at my disposal.


219
00:28:14,513 --> 00:28:16,749
Now, we are nine.


220
00:28:18,217 --> 00:28:23,823
How many other true samurai are left?


221
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:29,861
I'll take my leave.


222
00:28:52,718 --> 00:28:55,554
What was that meeting?


223
00:28:57,189 --> 00:28:58,857
Akashi samurai?


224
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:02,094
Now you know!


225
00:29:19,244 --> 00:29:22,580
How dare you point your sword
at us, novice!


226
00:29:22,781 --> 00:29:24,450
Who are you?


227
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,285
State your name.


228
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:30,221
Hirayama... I'm a Ronin.


229
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:37,962
He killed our sword masters
in one slice.


230
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:44,202
I won't permit such blatant
moves again.


231
00:29:44,403 --> 00:29:47,740
If Sir Doi decides to,
the coals we once cooled...


232
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,243
will ignite into a blaze
burning down our clan!


233
00:29:52,444 --> 00:29:55,815
Forgive me for my thoughtless act.


234
00:29:56,015 --> 00:30:01,252
Now it's clear. It is Shinzaemon.


235
00:30:02,288 --> 00:30:04,656
Place your bets.


236
00:30:04,856 --> 00:30:07,926
Odd or even.


237
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,318
Odd.


238
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,171
Odd.


239
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:33,046
Lady Luck is with you.


240
00:30:33,046 --> 00:30:35,227
Don't talk to me.


241
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,832
What?


242
00:30:37,098 --> 00:30:39,734
Luck leaves when unlucky men talk.


243
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:18,144
Shogun retainer Shimada's third son.


244
00:31:34,377 --> 00:31:38,648
Samurai are always asking
to borrow money.


245
00:31:38,848 --> 00:31:42,353
My shop is full of pawned swords.


246
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:47,657
These days, swords are only good for
cutting radishes.


247
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:02,938
Well, hello Uncle!


248
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:19,547
Womanizing at your age is bad form,
don't you think?


249
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:25,454
Bravo nephew! You young rogue.


250
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:30,762
Sake bought with gambling money
tastes best.


251
00:32:31,462 --> 00:32:33,531
Spare me the irony.


252
00:32:34,032 --> 00:32:36,900
Gambling is the only time I feel alive.
Samurai status doesn't suit me.


253
00:32:39,676 --> 00:32:42,378
I too hated being a samurai,
but then I realized...


254
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:47,284
I could never be a true player
by playing around.


255
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:51,822
A true player doesn't try so hard.


256
00:32:53,423 --> 00:32:55,459
I'm not trying too hard.


257
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:57,595
I wonder.


258
00:32:59,697 --> 00:33:01,832
How's your girl?


259
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:06,441
Well...


260
00:33:07,771 --> 00:33:10,641
she hasn't kicked me out yet.


261
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:16,047
Be yourself.
But don't overdo it!


262
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:23,953
Lords are making
their annual trips home.


263
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:26,990
Shouldn't you be busy?


264
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:31,796
Work is my excuse to gamble too.


265
00:33:33,697 --> 00:33:37,268
I'm on a mission, a long shot.


266
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:43,773
Will that gamble pay off?


267
00:33:43,973 --> 00:33:50,247
Pay off? It's like walking through
the eye of a needle.


268
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:55,185
Quit while you're ahead.


269
00:33:55,385 --> 00:33:57,354
You're clever.



270
00:33:58,055 --> 00:34:04,027
But your uncle is a born fool.
I go for broke and bet it all.


271
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,632
And if you win?


272
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:13,202
If by chance, I win...


273
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:17,974
In time,
someone might appreciate me.


274
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:20,878
Maybe.


275
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:30,286
Betting on yourself is true gambling.
Who's overdoing it now?


276
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:37,628
I'll say this, Shinrokuro...


277
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:45,702
My gamble is more exciting than yours,
with the same odds.


278
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:44,985
Shinrokuro, are you home?


279
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:57,632
You tease. If you're here, say so.


280
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:03,405
I'm neither here nor there.


281
00:37:03,606 --> 00:37:08,010
No teasing. You're right here.


282
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:15,250
I saw my uncle.


283
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,588
Sir Shinzaemon?


284
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:22,791
Yes.


285
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,603
Did something happen?


286
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,411
Tsuya...


287
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:49,157
No.


288
00:37:55,289 --> 00:37:57,130
Don't.


289
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,802
Shinrokuro.


290
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:09,438
I'll be gone for a while.


291
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,150
When will you return?


292
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:28,322
Soon. But if I'm late...


293
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:34,777
I'll be at the Festival of the Dead.


294
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,135
Burn the honorary torch and wait.

295
00:38:52,981 --> 00:38:57,186
This is one and only pupil.


296
00:38:57,385 --> 00:39:00,822
Ogura at your service.


297
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:04,793
Are your parents still alive?


298
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:12,034
Father died two years ago;
Mother passed when I was five.


299
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:18,773
I come from a lowly family
serving a noble´s concubine.


300
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:23,644
Since deciding to live for the sword,
I've waited for this day...


301
00:39:23,846 --> 00:39:26,715
to use my skills for society.


302
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:32,387
Allow me to join you.


303
00:39:32,588 --> 00:39:35,190
I request that you take him too.


304
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:39,561
But he's too young.


305
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:46,034
Shinzaemon, you're wrong.
Devotion knows no age.


306
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:51,340
A samurai's life isn't measured
in lengh, is it?


307
00:39:53,409 --> 00:39:56,110
My logic was shallow.


308
00:39:57,545 --> 00:40:00,916
May we ask your help?


309
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:03,552
Thank you very much!


310
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:06,755
I will surrender my life to serve you.


311
00:40:09,224 --> 00:40:11,626
And who might you be?


312
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:16,798
Sahara, a lowly ronin...


313
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:20,702
with no redeeming merit but my spear.


314
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:23,871
I vouch only for his skill.


315
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:26,240
Hirayama told me of your mission.


316
00:40:26,442 --> 00:40:32,715
Fighting a larger enemy is admirable.
I very much want to join but...


317
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,952
One small request.


318
00:40:37,152 --> 00:40:38,554
Which is?


319
00:40:38,753 --> 00:40:41,623
Pay me 200 ryo up front.


320
00:40:41,824 --> 00:40:44,992
You're only joining for the money?


321
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:50,565
Let me be clear. My sumpathy with your
cause has nothing to do with money.


322
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:57,172
With no relationship or debts to you,
do you expect me to work for free?


323
00:40:57,172 --> 00:41:00,429
How will you use the money?


324
00:41:00,766 --> 00:41:08,835
The first 120 ryo for lifelong debts, plus
something nice for my relatives.


325
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:12,702
Thirty ryo for a tomb for my wife,
who died from my hardships.


326
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:15,001
Twenty for my preparations as well.


327
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:17,635
And the rest?


328
00:41:17,635 --> 00:41:23,574
To experience the "luxuries"
I never had in this life.


329
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:31,639
My kind of man.
His spirit is a bargain at 200.


330
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,777
Now, we're 11.


331
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:39,782
Our quality outshines our quantity.


332
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:45,353
Shinrokuro is here.


333
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,835
I'll take the odds on your big gamble.


334
00:42:01,036 --> 00:42:02,670
What do you wager?


335
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:06,007
If it's a true gamble,
there's only one thing I can bet.


336
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:19,922
If you refuse, start by killing me now.


337
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:35,001
And now, we're 12!


338
00:42:55,324 --> 00:43:00,362
No mercy! There's no samurai code or
fair play in battle!


339
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:10,972
No sword? Use a stick.
No stick? Use a rock.


340
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,443
No rock?
Use your fists and feet!


341
00:43:14,643 --> 00:43:20,048
Lose your life,
but make the enemy pay!


342
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,117
Horii.


343
00:43:25,054 --> 00:43:26,320
Higuchi.


344
00:43:27,322 --> 00:43:30,925
Train in explosives.


345
00:43:47,175 --> 00:43:49,744
Rest in peace.


346
00:43:51,146 --> 00:43:54,885
I'll join you shortly.


347
00:43:56,952 --> 00:44:02,791
Hurry up with the preparations.
We depart soon.


348
00:44:46,278 --> 00:44:49,681
Lord Naritsugu departs tomorrow.


349
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:51,751
Finally, he makes a move.


350
00:44:51,918 --> 00:44:56,088
So where's our best point of attack?


351
00:44:56,255 --> 00:44:59,157
How about the Toda boat crossing?


352
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:02,929
They'll send half their men first.


353
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:06,766
The others will stand guard
as Naritsugu crosses.


354
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:11,436
Better to attack them.


355
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:16,675
No, they'll be on full alert.
Won't make any wrong moves.

356
00:45:16,876 --> 00:45:22,849
Let's keep them anxious and running,
never knowing where we'll strike.

357
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:28,554
That's a good point to consider.


358
00:45:29,655 --> 00:45:32,625
Shinza? You here?


359
00:45:32,824 --> 00:45:36,262
It's Hanbei Kito of the Akashi clan.


360
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,036
Shinza!


361
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:55,547
Hanbei. I knew you'd come.


362
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:59,652
Glad to see you.


363
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,956
I thought you had left already.


364
00:46:05,992 --> 00:46:08,661
I'd enjoy a match of go.


365
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,898
I still lead in wins.


366
00:46:12,097 --> 00:46:15,635
Leave our score aside
until we meet again.


367
00:46:15,835 --> 00:46:18,304
Again?


368
00:46:19,505 --> 00:46:23,675
For years I envied you: a man from
a good family, close to the Shogun...


369
00:46:23,876 --> 00:46:26,244
appointed to his elite guards.


370
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:33,119
After you moved up,
I commanded the same post.


371
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:39,525
To catch up,
I joined Lord Naritsugu.


372
00:46:39,724 --> 00:46:45,931
He earned a fortune
when he was adopted by the Akashi.


373
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:52,472
That led me into this situation.


374
00:46:52,672 --> 00:46:56,309
What an ill twist of fate.

375
00:46:57,342 --> 00:47:01,646
Perhaps we both embraced fate.


376
00:47:01,847 --> 00:47:05,117
A samurai leads a helpless life.


377
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:12,324
Mamiya should've committed harakiri
in front of his Lord.


378
00:47:13,525 --> 00:47:15,961
I once had that intention...


379
00:47:16,161 --> 00:47:24,070
but I could not betray his father,
the former Shogun.


380
00:47:25,905 --> 00:47:29,641
I lost my chance to move ahead.


381
00:47:29,842 --> 00:47:33,146
I regret not beating you.


382
00:47:33,346 --> 00:47:37,349
I was unable to commit harakiri.


383
00:47:40,018 --> 00:47:46,092
As a samurai, I'll do what must be done
for the people.


384
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,163
For the people?


385
00:47:53,532 --> 00:48:00,106
A samurai must do but one thing.
Serve his master, correct?


386
00:48:09,481 --> 00:48:12,885
What an ill twist of fate.


387
00:48:14,253 --> 00:48:19,458
It's a long road to the Akashi domain.


388
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:21,527
See you there.


389
00:48:21,726 --> 00:48:24,262
Bet on it.


390
00:48:52,255 --> 00:48:55,197
Edo


391
00:50:44,202 --> 00:50:49,340
Uncle, three days have passed
since Naritsugu left Edo.


392
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:54,945
Where do we make our stand?


393
00:50:57,815 --> 00:51:01,152
How will Shinza make his move?


394
00:51:29,023 --> 00:51:31,335
We kept your waiting.


395
00:51:32,717 --> 00:51:38,389
The verdict is out.
Brothers, we take Lord Naritsugu at...


396
00:51:41,025 --> 00:51:45,597
Ochiai in the Mino province.


397
00:51:45,797 --> 00:51:47,865
Ochiai.


398
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:54,572
Naritsugu offended the Owari
by killing makino's son in Kiso.


399
00:51:55,606 --> 00:52:01,445
We can enlist Makino's help at Kiso.


400
00:52:01,646 --> 00:52:05,182
Ask him to sign a non-transit act
using Lord Owari's name...

401
00:52:05,382 --> 00:52:08,552
to ban Naritsugu from passing.


402
00:52:08,786 --> 00:52:14,425
He'll join us due to the murder
of his son and daughter-in-law.


403
00:52:14,626 --> 00:52:15,893
And then?


404
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:18,362
Only two possible routes.


405
00:52:18,563 --> 00:52:23,802
The Kiso Pass or the Kamizaka Pass.


406
00:52:24,001 --> 00:52:28,739
Either way, he must pass via Ochiai.


407
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,311
We'll fortify Ochiai and strike hard.


408
00:52:35,112 --> 00:52:40,652
What if they forgo appearances
and don't pay respect to the Naegi clan?


409
00:52:40,851 --> 00:52:45,824
There's a chance they may not stop.


410
00:52:46,023 --> 00:52:49,126
But I wager they will.

411
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:54,898
With 12 men challenging
a bigger enemy...


412
00:52:56,101 --> 00:53:02,139
no matter how much we plan,
we must have faith in luck.


413
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:05,976
We pick here and risk it all.


414
00:53:07,344 --> 00:53:13,451
With heaven's will, the dice say Ochiai.


415
00:53:18,188 --> 00:53:19,590
Risk it all!


416
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:44,695
Kuranaga, you're best suited
to get Makino's assistance.


417
00:54:44,896 --> 00:54:49,099
Leave it to me.
I'll get that road blocked.


418
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,268
- Take Ishizuka with you.
- I'm grateful.


419
00:54:51,469 --> 00:54:54,105
Let's get moving.


420
00:54:54,304 --> 00:54:55,773
Excuse us.


421
00:54:57,842 --> 00:54:59,710
Mitsuhashi, ready the horses.


422
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:02,045
Ready and waiting, sir.

423
00:55:02,246 --> 00:55:08,452
Go on ahead and negotiate with
the Mayor of Ochiai.


424
00:55:10,188 --> 00:55:13,992
Give him these orders from Sir Doi.


425
00:55:14,192 --> 00:55:17,829
Understood. How should I proceed?


426
00:55:18,028 --> 00:55:20,465
Buy them all out.


427
00:55:21,498 --> 00:55:22,733
Yes, sir.


428
00:55:54,663 --> 00:55:56,146
Let's ride!


429
00:55:57,072 --> 00:56:00,842
Fast and hard to pass the enemy!


430
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:48,130
You Shinzaemon Shimada?


431
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:50,998
In the flesh.


432
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:54,202
Are you Akashi henchmen?


433
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,728
Don't follow them!


434
00:58:55,797 --> 00:58:57,532
Anyone hurt?


435
00:59:01,135 --> 00:59:05,407
That Hanbei, he drew first blood.


436
00:59:05,606 --> 00:59:09,311
Probably put coins in the hands
of these broke ronin.


437
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:14,282
Not a real attack. His aim was
to break our strengh.


438
00:59:21,889 --> 00:59:23,958
First time you killed as well?


439
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:28,063
I've fenced with real blades
many times but...


440
00:59:28,262 --> 00:59:31,599
killing a man is a first.


441
00:59:38,072 --> 00:59:42,878
There's only one road,
but we don't know where they'll strike.


442
00:59:43,077 --> 00:59:46,981
If they attack harder next time,
we could get hurt.


443
00:59:48,983 --> 00:59:53,320
Let's accept Hanbei's welcome.


444
00:59:56,858 --> 01:00:01,797
And we'll vanish as well.


445
01:00:02,382 --> 01:00:03,501
Huh?


446
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,764
Hioki's got some new friends!


447
01:00:45,365 --> 01:00:46,967
Disgusting!


448
01:01:13,161 --> 01:01:16,697
We'll travel northwest along the ridge,
and cut through the valley.


449
01:01:16,898 --> 01:01:21,135
Over the mountain to Owari territory.


450
01:01:22,269 --> 01:01:27,708
I had strict monastic training
when I was young in the mountains.


451
01:01:27,876 --> 01:01:34,548
The mountain brings blessing but
its true nature is fear itself.


452
01:01:35,949 --> 01:01:37,351
I see.


453
01:01:46,561 --> 01:01:50,264
We are nobodies.


454
01:01:51,632 --> 01:01:52,766
Huh?


455
01:01:52,766 --> 01:01:58,840
He's right. No titles, no affiliations.
Nobodies.


456
01:02:38,878 --> 01:02:40,547
A buyout?


457
01:02:40,746 --> 01:02:42,916
That is our wish.


458
01:02:43,115 --> 01:02:47,653
I won't go against
Sir Doi's orders.


459
01:02:47,853 --> 01:02:54,094
But convincing the town will be hard.


460
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,583
What?


461
01:03:06,072 --> 01:03:09,409
Our deposit. Not enough?


462
01:03:17,784 --> 01:03:20,320
The forest grows thicker.


463
01:03:21,387 --> 01:03:25,563
Hirayama, we're lost.


464
01:03:26,259 --> 01:03:28,827
Perhaps we should have detoured
at that cliff?


465
01:03:28,994 --> 01:03:31,197
- That can't be.
- But...


466
01:03:39,972 --> 01:03:43,215
Who are you?


467
01:03:43,215 --> 01:03:47,054
A bandit?
Or a raccoon goblin?


468
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,369
Do I look like a raccoon?


469
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:54,780
Ouch!


470
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:06,800
Couldn't lower me down, idiot!?


471
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,679
At least thank me.


472
01:04:11,304 --> 01:04:13,972
You from these parts?


473
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:18,811
- Do I look so?
- Insolent!


474
01:04:32,826 --> 01:04:36,795
I ain't no ghost or bandit.


475
01:04:38,664 --> 01:04:41,668
I hunt beasts from mountain
to mountain.


476
01:04:41,867 --> 01:04:43,635
Any men with you?


477
01:04:44,971 --> 01:04:48,507
Gone. 'Cause I laid my hands on Upashi.


478
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:50,643
Upashi?


479
01:04:52,512 --> 01:04:54,481
The boss's woman.


480
01:04:56,248 --> 01:05:00,186
So he punished you. Fools are the same
wherever you go.


481
01:05:01,221 --> 01:05:02,889
Hold your tongue!


482
01:05:03,088 --> 01:05:05,291
Got a name, son?


483
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:08,862
Koyata Kiga.


484
01:05:09,061 --> 01:05:12,831
My ancestors were defeated warriors,
legitimate Samurai stock.


485
01:05:16,902 --> 01:05:18,637
What's so funny?


486
01:05:18,838 --> 01:05:23,242
The name's Shinzaemon.
And these are my men.


487
01:05:25,945 --> 01:05:28,047
What are Samurai doing out here?


488
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:32,818
A shortcut made us lose our way.


489
01:05:36,856 --> 01:05:41,161
I'll be your guide,
if you got food.


490
01:05:42,929 --> 01:05:44,563
Deal?


491
01:05:46,266 --> 01:05:47,478
Deal?


492
01:06:01,313 --> 01:06:02,849
What's that?


493
01:06:03,882 --> 01:06:07,650
Don't like bugs?
Watch...


494
01:06:11,623 --> 01:06:14,518
Don't be a little girl!


495
01:06:14,768 --> 01:06:16,684
What?


496
01:06:24,237 --> 01:06:26,373
Let's go.


497
01:06:29,976 --> 01:06:31,945
What now?


498
01:07:04,878 --> 01:07:07,130
Leave the rabbit.


499
01:07:07,713 --> 01:07:09,949
We have important work to do.


500
01:07:11,184 --> 01:07:12,786
More important than roast rabbit?


501
01:07:18,456 --> 01:07:20,324
Sir Hanbei!


502
01:07:20,525 --> 01:07:22,340
What is it?


503
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:23,538
Emergency.


504
01:07:23,713 --> 01:07:26,226
Lord Naritsugu's passage is banned.


505
01:07:26,396 --> 01:07:28,722
His passage is banned?


506
01:07:35,206 --> 01:07:37,141
What's the matter?


507
01:07:44,882 --> 01:07:50,655
You fools, will you stand idly by
at this humiliation?


508
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,070
Lord Owari is from the top three clans.


509
01:08:05,304 --> 01:08:09,440
But I am the son of the former Shogun,


510
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,411
and brother to the current Shogun.


511
01:08:13,445 --> 01:08:14,947
Cross over!


512
01:08:15,146 --> 01:08:16,614
Watch and learn.


513
01:08:16,748 --> 01:08:22,135
We must go through Owari land.
Can our Lord swallow his pride?


514
01:08:22,462 --> 01:08:26,634
Let's see if he gets his way
as he usually does.


515
01:08:31,418 --> 01:08:33,238
Who are you?


516
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,402
Identity yourself.


517
01:08:40,305 --> 01:08:42,041
Out of my way...


518
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:45,778
or I'll kill you without mercy.


519
01:08:47,112 --> 01:08:49,113
Last April...


520
01:08:49,247 --> 01:08:52,283
in Kiso, you killed my son...


521
01:08:53,318 --> 01:08:58,988
Uneme Makino and his wife.
I am Yukie Makino.


522
01:09:02,115 --> 01:09:05,086
Does daddy monkey have hard bones too?


523
01:09:07,371 --> 01:09:09,047
My Lord!


524
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:16,489
Hanbei?


525
01:09:16,684 --> 01:09:17,721
Leave this.


526
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:21,429
Let's go back.


527
01:09:30,756 --> 01:09:34,560
Owari only banned Lord Naritsugu.


528
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:39,898
His entourage can enter.
They are Akashi members.


529
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:42,451
I see.


530
01:09:43,658 --> 01:09:45,712
The rest will guard our Lord.


531
01:09:49,881 --> 01:09:53,604
If people hear Owari blocked us...


532
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:57,997
If we don't visit the Naegi,
our Lord will be ridiculed.


533
01:09:58,605 --> 01:10:00,913
Let them laugh.


534
01:10:01,104 --> 01:10:04,608
Within a year,
our Lord will be second-in-command.


535
01:10:05,185 --> 01:10:11,690
You risk his life and the Akashi clan by
visiting the Naegi.


536
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:17,029
You seem most afraid of Shinzaemon.


537
01:10:17,229 --> 01:10:21,212
What can that weak Shogun servant do?


538
01:10:21,591 --> 01:10:25,868
Since paying off the ronin,
there's no sign of him.


539
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:29,742
Perhaps he fears our clan and ran?


540
01:10:29,966 --> 01:10:34,527
Don't you see? He's the one who
blocked our passage.

541
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:45,958
Do you cling to your life so as to
make me a laughing stock?


542
01:10:46,126 --> 01:10:50,000
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.


543
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:57,506
I hear any samurai would chose death
over making his Lord a laughing stock.


544
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:10,617
Choose the foolish path.


545
01:11:13,653 --> 01:11:16,146
It's more fun that way.


546
01:11:20,493 --> 01:11:23,171
Let's go, Hanbei.


547
01:11:23,762 --> 01:11:25,680
Move out!


548
01:12:37,938 --> 01:12:40,140
We've has enough.


549
01:12:55,555 --> 01:12:58,225
Oh, the road.


550
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,881
The road!


551
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:07,747
Welcome. Been expecting you.


552
01:15:07,947 --> 01:15:08,948
You've prepared well.


553
01:15:09,148 --> 01:15:10,983
Progress couldn't be better.

554
01:15:11,149 --> 01:15:13,452
Did it work?


555
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:20,162
Makino stopped them perfectly.
Naritsugu diverted his troops.


556
01:15:20,412 --> 01:15:21,309
Well, well.


557
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,292
Our long shot paid off.


558
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:25,475
How many men with Naritsugu?


559
01:15:25,681 --> 01:15:27,287
Seventy men.


560
01:15:27,712 --> 01:15:29,796
And Makino?


561
01:15:30,002 --> 01:15:36,238
He left nothing to chance.
He chose the path of harakiri.


562
01:15:37,363 --> 01:15:42,202
He took full blame,
left no evidence behind.


563
01:15:43,384 --> 01:15:45,512
He's a mighty Samurai.


564
01:15:48,054 --> 01:15:52,324
We must achieve our mission for him.


565
01:15:54,377 --> 01:15:56,417
Hey!


566
01:16:00,365 --> 01:16:02,399
Got dinner!


567
01:16:02,761 --> 01:16:04,628
Who is he?


568
01:16:06,063 --> 01:16:08,832
He dropped in when we entered
the forest.


569
01:16:09,018 --> 01:16:10,752
Dropped in?


570
01:18:04,712 --> 01:18:09,243
Set a trap here using
this rock wall.


571
01:18:15,722 --> 01:18:18,658
This alley is a hard nut to crack.

572
01:18:22,713 --> 01:18:25,685
Shinrokuro, what do you see?


573
01:18:25,878 --> 01:18:28,119
Looks like an ordinary boarding town.


574
01:18:28,311 --> 01:18:29,782
It is.


575
01:18:29,856 --> 01:18:35,030
So we'll transform it into
a town of death.


576
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,831
Mitsuhashi,
get busy with the preparations.


577
01:18:38,904 --> 01:18:42,255
Send Ishizuka to keep watch.


578
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,378
Upashi.


579
01:19:19,443 --> 01:19:21,011
Miss home?


580
01:19:23,646 --> 01:19:25,782
I miss Upashi.


581
01:19:27,317 --> 01:19:28,752
Is she that fine?


582
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:36,913
Like no woman you've ever seen.


583
01:19:38,795 --> 01:19:45,167
Soon, this quiet town will become
a bloodbath.


584
01:19:45,782 --> 01:19:48,073
Go home alive while you can.


585
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:52,242
I have no home.


586
01:19:52,442 --> 01:19:56,246
This is our fight.
You're not a Samurai.


587
01:20:00,016 --> 01:20:04,046
Don't trifle with your life.
Got it?


588
01:20:07,123 --> 01:20:09,091
Damn Samurai!


589
01:20:10,127 --> 01:20:15,164
You and your honor and causes!


590
01:20:17,466 --> 01:20:19,670
I'll show you!


591
01:22:27,396 --> 01:22:28,231
Vanished?


592
01:22:28,431 --> 01:22:32,296
Lord Naritsugu passed through
Komagane along the Ina road.


593
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:36,742
Then he vanished.


594
01:22:36,922 --> 01:22:39,274
Back to Edo?


595
01:22:39,627 --> 01:22:42,194
Not possible with Naritsugu in control.


596
01:22:42,563 --> 01:22:47,525
I'm concerned he'll cut through
to the Sanshu road and skip lida.


597
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:50,847
Without visiting the Naegi clan?

598
01:22:52,402 --> 01:22:53,636
Stand down.


599
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:56,907
Now, the playing field is level.


600
01:22:57,106 --> 01:23:01,345
Hanbei is trying to ascertain
our next move.


601
01:23:03,113 --> 01:23:06,182
We wait here. Prepare for battle.


602
01:23:12,122 --> 01:23:14,091
Batten down that side.


603
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:29,672
Yes! Put it there.


604
01:23:56,166 --> 01:24:01,404
If they don't show today,
they must have gone to Okazaki.


605
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:04,207
Another route?


606
01:24:04,408 --> 01:24:07,743
Waiting is killing our chances.


607
01:24:07,944 --> 01:24:11,247
Let's abandon Ochiai tonight.


608
01:24:11,448 --> 01:24:15,418
We can cross the pass
to the Sanshu Road.


609
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:20,341
Shinzaemon, it's time to decide!


610
01:24:20,712 --> 01:24:21,649
Too soon.


611
01:24:21,837 --> 01:24:23,569
But...


612
01:24:24,605 --> 01:24:28,806
Do you know the secret to fishing?


613
01:24:31,868 --> 01:24:35,466
Wait until the fish swallows the hook.


614
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:37,939
Reel it when it swallows.
It's simple.


615
01:24:38,314 --> 01:24:46,511
But if you reel in too soon,
the fish will escape with the bait.


616
01:24:48,015 --> 01:24:52,520
So you say the Akashi are close?


617
01:24:53,876 --> 01:24:58,405
With Hanbei ar Naritsugu's side,
there is a chance...


618
01:24:58,796 --> 01:25:00,871
They might skip the Naegi.


619
01:25:01,057 --> 01:25:03,730
Their numbers are not like ours.


620
01:25:03,925 --> 01:25:06,694
Even if they went off the road...


621
01:25:06,873 --> 01:25:13,460
seventy men cannot travel
without being noticed.


622
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:21,376
They must be in one place,
awaiting our next move.


623
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:24,323
And if this is so?


624
01:25:24,503 --> 01:25:28,530
They'll come if they think it's safe.


625
01:25:30,055 --> 01:25:33,948
We wait until the fish swallows
the hook.


626
01:25:49,784 --> 01:25:51,016
They're here!


627
01:25:51,884 --> 01:25:53,377
They're here!


628
01:25:53,564 --> 01:25:55,466
They're coming!


629
01:25:56,418 --> 01:25:58,030
The Akashi men are coming!

630
01:25:58,221 --> 01:25:59,286
From where?


631
01:26:00,993 --> 01:26:05,318
Along the Ohira road.
But there are not 70.


632
01:26:05,507 --> 01:26:06,420
What?


633
01:26:09,006 --> 01:26:12,645
Many more. Over 200!


634
01:26:13,006 --> 01:26:14,152
Two hundred?


635
01:26:32,176 --> 01:26:38,975
Hanbei! He bought time and summoned
troops from other areas!


636
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:42,438
Twelve men can never defeat 200.


637
01:26:44,823 --> 01:26:50,389
So what! As for the fish that takes
the hook... the bigger, the better.


638
01:26:57,573 --> 01:27:00,938
Heaven's will brought us all together.


639
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:10,948
Thirteen.


640
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:21,414
The time has come to lay down
your lives for the greater cause.


641
01:27:23,507 --> 01:27:24,854
Are you ready?


642
01:27:26,122 --> 01:27:27,891
Ready to die?


643
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:29,743
Yes!


644
01:28:24,905 --> 01:28:29,038
Take your posts!


645
01:28:50,707 --> 01:28:52,743
Halt!


646
01:28:55,399 --> 01:28:57,350
Asakawa, wait here.


647
01:28:57,787 --> 01:28:59,588
Let me through.


648
01:29:35,501 --> 01:29:37,036
Move out!


649
01:30:26,023 --> 01:30:27,990
How much longer to Nakatsugawa?


650
01:30:30,726 --> 01:30:32,595
Tell me how far!


651
01:30:44,474 --> 01:30:46,309
What's the matter?


652
01:30:46,542 --> 01:30:47,810
Oh no!


653
01:30:48,011 --> 01:30:50,546
My Lord!


654
01:30:55,685 --> 01:30:58,078
Turn back! My Lord!


655
01:31:36,025 --> 01:31:39,274
What fun.
I'm going in, Hanbei!


656
01:31:41,398 --> 01:31:44,100
My Lord! Follow him!


657
01:31:48,738 --> 01:31:50,306
Hey!


658
01:31:52,743 --> 01:31:54,778
You can get past this way.


659
01:31:56,412 --> 01:31:58,965
This way, this way.


660
01:32:59,975 --> 01:33:01,610
Shinzaemon.


661
01:33:02,121 --> 01:33:08,264
I presume you are the Akashi entourage
of Lord Naritsugu.


662
01:33:10,554 --> 01:33:15,435
By the order of his Shogun's subject
Shinzaemon...


663
01:33:15,858 --> 01:33:19,806
we commemorate your passage
with arrows!


664
01:33:21,965 --> 01:33:22,966
My Lord!


665
01:33:26,336 --> 01:33:27,537
My Lord!


666
01:33:30,085 --> 01:33:32,172
Leave the horses. Protect our Lord.


667
01:34:33,136 --> 01:34:34,591
My Lord!


668
01:34:45,438 --> 01:34:47,354
Come this way!


669
01:34:48,547 --> 01:34:49,877
Please wait.


670
01:34:50,146 --> 01:34:51,734
Secure the interior.


671
01:34:52,917 --> 01:34:54,719
Secure the interior.


672
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,197
Hey, Secure the interior.


673
01:35:45,929 --> 01:35:48,537
Enough petty tricks.


674
01:35:54,548 --> 01:35:58,130
Only 130 left!


675
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:01,619
What you paid for my life...


676
01:36:01,994 --> 01:36:04,154
was a real bargain.


677
01:36:05,929 --> 01:36:09,574
The enemy is not large! Don't panic.


678
01:36:09,935 --> 01:36:12,893
Show them the spirit of Akashi Samurai!


679
01:36:13,068 --> 01:36:18,394
Trade your lives to protect our Lord.


680
01:36:36,426 --> 01:36:37,944
My Lord!


681
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:40,612
Lord!


682
01:36:49,372 --> 01:36:55,590
TOTAL MASSACRE


683
01:37:11,309 --> 01:37:14,940
Kill! Kill them all!


684
01:39:40,292 --> 01:39:41,539
Ogura!


685
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:03,752
Fire? No, no!


686
01:40:46,961 --> 01:40:49,185
My Lord! I found a way out!


687
01:40:57,689 --> 01:41:00,149
No! It's a trap.


688
01:41:03,963 --> 01:41:05,033
My Lord!


689
01:41:14,591 --> 01:41:16,201
Come!


690
01:41:47,869 --> 01:41:49,109
Hioki!


691
01:42:01,079 --> 01:42:02,810
Go, go!


692
01:42:02,990 --> 01:42:04,320
This way, my Lord.


693
01:42:47,514 --> 01:42:48,653
Look.


694
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:19,963
Ogura, kill the men that get past me.


695
01:43:20,007 --> 01:43:22,537
Don't leave one alive.


696
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:24,364
Yes, master.


697
01:43:29,001 --> 01:43:30,469
Kill!


698
01:44:37,143 --> 01:44:38,676
Retreat.


699
01:44:42,823 --> 01:44:44,068
Ogura!


700
01:45:20,298 --> 01:45:22,738
Your Samurai brawls are crazy fun.


701
01:45:22,948 --> 01:45:25,261
It's no brawl!


702
01:45:28,265 --> 01:45:30,302
Why are you Samurai so arrogant?


703
01:45:33,649 --> 01:45:35,783
Why are you samurai...


704
01:45:36,014 --> 01:45:40,118
so arrogant?


705
01:45:50,819 --> 01:45:53,506
Higuchi, you okay?


706
01:45:55,237 --> 01:45:56,872
Thanks.


707
01:46:18,604 --> 01:46:20,833
Hioki!


708
01:46:59,354 --> 01:47:00,918
Hioki...


709
01:47:02,686 --> 01:47:07,148
You fought well. A true Samurai.


710
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:11,972
Shinzaemon.


711
01:47:15,448 --> 01:47:17,228
Higuchi!


712
01:47:44,743 --> 01:47:47,447
- Go!
- Finish the job.


713
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:06,051
Ishizuka!


714
01:48:15,554 --> 01:48:17,813
Ishizuka!


715
01:48:25,163 --> 01:48:26,775
Otake...


716
01:48:28,695 --> 01:48:32,532
Our mission...


717
01:48:32,854 --> 01:48:36,768
finish it!


718
01:48:43,487 --> 01:48:44,954
Shinzaemon!


719
01:49:28,954 --> 01:49:30,372
Mitsuhashi!


720
01:49:41,496 --> 01:49:43,332
Damn!


721
01:49:49,976 --> 01:49:51,578
Mitsuhashi!


722
01:50:52,148 --> 01:50:54,015
You fool!


723
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:01,265
Hanbei...


724
01:51:01,345 --> 01:51:04,414
You think the age of war was like this?


725
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:07,287
Perhaps.


726
01:51:08,939 --> 01:51:11,265
It's magnificent.


727
01:51:14,332 --> 01:51:18,764
With death comes gratitude for life.


728
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:23,944
If a man has lived in vain,
then how trivial his life is.


729
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:30,273
Oh, Hanbei.


730
01:51:30,453 --> 01:51:33,362
Something wonderful has come to
my mind.


731
01:51:34,707 --> 01:51:38,127
Once I'm on the Shogun's council,


732
01:51:38,197 --> 01:51:41,664
let's bring back the age of war.


733
01:52:29,358 --> 01:52:33,832
I'm Saheira Kuranaga.


734
01:52:34,033 --> 01:52:36,202
Lord Naritsugu...


735
01:52:36,262 --> 01:52:39,405
I've come for your life.


736
01:52:41,822 --> 01:52:43,252
Sir Hanbei...


737
01:52:44,649 --> 01:52:49,119
protect our Lord.


738
01:53:19,542 --> 01:53:21,786
Kuranaga!


739
01:54:11,601 --> 01:54:13,002
My Lord!


740
01:56:02,279 --> 01:56:06,850
Master...


741
01:57:50,552 --> 01:57:53,221
Who are you?


742
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,519
You're no Samurai!


743
01:57:57,744 --> 01:58:00,046
So what?


744
01:58:06,261 --> 01:58:08,497
Do only samurai matter in this world?


745
01:58:14,738 --> 01:58:18,046
I thought samurai would be fun...


746
01:58:18,871 --> 01:58:20,840
but you bore me.


747
01:58:21,757 --> 01:58:27,721
You're useless.
Even more useless in great numbers.


748
01:58:48,117 --> 01:58:50,591
This man speaks the truth.


749
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:54,317
His reward is my short sword.


750
01:58:55,350 --> 01:58:58,385
If we can get past that...


751
01:58:59,355 --> 01:59:03,274
Remain focused. Victory is ours!


752
01:59:03,506 --> 01:59:06,643
Keep our Lord safe. We'll win!


753
01:59:53,417 --> 01:59:54,586
My Lord!


754
01:59:55,859 --> 01:59:58,029
Let's run.


755
01:59:59,467 --> 02:00:03,850
Hanbei, victory is not yet ours.


756
02:00:18,744 --> 02:00:20,779
Shinza.


757
02:00:28,667 --> 02:00:32,328
Hanbei, I have no qualms with you.


758
02:00:34,465 --> 02:00:36,402
You will not pass.


759
02:00:37,384 --> 02:00:41,462
I'll trade my life to protect my Lord.


760
02:00:43,185 --> 02:00:45,622
I must do what must be done.


761
02:00:46,908 --> 02:00:51,582
Are you so hungry for my Lord's life?


762
02:00:51,764 --> 02:00:53,899
Yes!


763
02:00:54,975 --> 02:01:02,136
I gambled my life in this senseless war
of power and politics.


764
02:01:03,837 --> 02:01:06,752
If he joins the Shogun's council...


765
02:01:06,847 --> 02:01:13,136
You know disaster will befall
the people!


766
02:01:13,310 --> 02:01:14,347
Am I wrong?


767
02:01:14,555 --> 02:01:16,221
So what then?


768
02:01:17,164 --> 02:01:21,123
Both you and I were born samurai.


769
02:01:21,314 --> 02:01:23,168
Ours is not to wonder why.


770
02:01:23,284 --> 02:01:25,569
Ours is...


771
02:01:25,738 --> 02:01:29,007
to obey our fate and die.


772
02:01:30,761 --> 02:01:33,296
If you were my ally...


773
02:01:33,466 --> 02:01:38,185
if you were not an Akashi retainer...


774
02:01:39,376 --> 02:01:41,377
not work
wouldn't our task be easier?


775
02:01:41,445 --> 02:01:43,871
Don't lecture me!

776
02:01:44,032 --> 02:01:48,613
No matter how low I go,
Hanbei Kito is a Samurai!


777
02:01:48,806 --> 02:01:52,801
I won't hand over my Lord's head
so easily.


778
02:02:00,453 --> 02:02:02,255
Shinza...


779
02:02:03,893 --> 02:02:07,592
to pass, you'll have to kill me.


780
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:17,149
That I shall do.


781
02:02:18,073 --> 02:02:19,807
Fight!


782
02:02:30,826 --> 02:02:34,073
Such elegance in fighting one-on-one.


783
02:03:17,698 --> 02:03:20,927
How I missed crossing swords with you!


784
02:03:26,948 --> 02:03:28,533
Hanbei...


785
02:03:29,609 --> 02:03:33,675
in the dojo, we were an even match.


786
02:03:47,774 --> 02:03:49,175
Hanbei...


787
02:03:51,579 --> 02:03:53,748
see you in hell!


788
02:04:28,439 --> 02:04:30,600
Some call it elegance.


789
02:04:30,784 --> 02:04:35,238
Some call it
cruel and unfair.


790
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:37,904
I like it.


791
02:05:07,201 --> 02:05:11,931
How can you kick his head?


792
02:05:12,126 --> 02:05:14,261
He gave his life for you!


793
02:05:16,217 --> 02:05:19,188
Kick my head if you want.


794
02:05:27,740 --> 02:05:33,716
For the Shogun, for the people,
for the many who died untimely deaths...


795
02:05:33,931 --> 02:05:36,188
for Uneme makino and his wife...


796
02:05:36,268 --> 02:05:40,533
for his father Yukie Makino...


797
02:05:40,702 --> 02:05:45,509
and for my men scattering Ochiai.


798
02:05:45,682 --> 02:05:47,663
For that...


799
02:05:49,322 --> 02:05:53,323
innocent, nameless young girl...


800
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:56,594
with severed arms and legs...


801
02:05:58,405 --> 02:06:01,394
I shall take your life!


802
02:06:02,997 --> 02:06:04,384
Ruling is convenient...


803
02:06:04,538 --> 02:06:08,426
but only for rulers.


804
02:06:09,574 --> 02:06:12,708
The people must live to serve.


805
02:06:14,898 --> 02:06:21,146
Even so, a time comes when servants
rise up against their Lords.


806
02:06:24,317 --> 02:06:28,300
You're on top
thanks to support from the bottom.


807
02:06:28,525 --> 02:06:30,279
Don't you see?


808
02:06:38,815 --> 02:06:42,762
Your mistake is believing that


809
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:46,395
your decorative blade is not
just for show.


810
02:06:47,543 --> 02:06:51,222
Nonsense. It's not for show!


811
02:06:51,412 --> 02:06:56,020
Decoration is for show.


812
02:06:56,189 --> 02:07:00,789
Be silent like the decorative man
you are.


813
02:07:02,868 --> 02:07:04,940
Servant!


814
02:07:09,576 --> 02:07:12,112
How is this for show?


815
02:07:37,912 --> 02:07:39,613
Uncle!


816
02:07:45,255 --> 02:07:46,355
Pain!


817
02:07:58,326 --> 02:08:00,694
It hurts!


818
02:08:04,278 --> 02:08:06,279
That's unexpected.


819
02:08:07,395 --> 02:08:09,760
Can you feel pain?


820
02:08:12,061 --> 02:08:15,032
Am I dying?


821
02:08:16,551 --> 02:08:18,979
Dying?


822
02:08:24,408 --> 02:08:28,641
I'm scared. So scared.


823
02:08:28,837 --> 02:08:29,837
Scared.


824
02:08:35,628 --> 02:08:37,966
I don't want...


825
02:08:39,925 --> 02:08:41,893
to die.


826
02:08:46,856 --> 02:08:48,416
I'm scared.


827
02:09:03,251 --> 02:09:05,706
My Lord...


828
02:09:05,877 --> 02:09:08,503
prepare yourself!


829
02:09:12,185 --> 02:09:17,327
Death comes for us all!


830
02:09:23,435 --> 02:09:29,319
Allow me to thank you, Shinzaemon.


831
02:09:38,582 --> 02:09:42,152
Of all the days of my life,


832
02:09:42,337 --> 02:09:46,219
today has been the most exciting.


833
02:09:49,382 --> 02:09:51,061
You're welcome!


834
02:10:02,539 --> 02:10:04,354
It's over.


835
02:10:09,698 --> 02:10:12,110
The big gamble paid off.


836
02:10:19,824 --> 02:10:21,961
Shinrokuro...


837
02:10:23,996 --> 02:10:26,565
being a samurai...


838
02:10:28,037 --> 02:10:32,926
is truly a burden.


839
02:10:38,655 --> 02:10:41,707
Do what you want...


840
02:10:43,097 --> 02:10:45,503
with your life.


841
02:12:22,984 --> 02:12:25,176
Are you immortal?


842
02:12:26,703 --> 02:12:29,456
You got the Lord's head without me?


843
02:12:31,555 --> 02:12:33,643
Our fight is over.


844
02:12:35,458 --> 02:12:37,606
That ain't no fun.


845
02:12:39,690 --> 02:12:41,792
You hurt?


846
02:12:43,666 --> 02:12:49,189
Compared to fighting a wild bear,
these wounds are nothing.


847
02:12:52,881 --> 02:12:55,179
All in all...


848
02:12:56,421 --> 02:12:58,756
I want my Upashi.


849
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:06,667
I don't like towns swarming
with Samurai.


850
02:13:07,787 --> 02:13:11,841
I'll go home,
sweep Upahi off her feet...


851
02:13:12,024 --> 02:13:14,552
and live far away!


852
02:13:15,871 --> 02:13:18,056
Live your life.


853
02:13:20,903 --> 02:13:23,037
'Til the next life!


854
02:13:29,585 --> 02:13:31,554
What are you going to do?


855
02:13:34,712 --> 02:13:38,659
Whatever I want.
Been a Samurai long enough.


856
02:13:40,277 --> 02:13:43,057
Become a bandit.


857
02:13:43,331 --> 02:13:49,122
The greatest bandit in Japan. Jump ship
to America, make love to women.


858
02:13:49,296 --> 02:13:52,921
Now you're talking.


859
02:13:55,055 --> 02:13:57,309
Say "hi" to Upashi for me.


860
02:14:02,064 --> 02:14:04,033
Sure.


861
02:16:36,772 --> 02:16:38,886
In May 1844,


862
02:16:38,935 --> 02:16:43,868
it was reported to
the Central Government...


863
02:16:44,054 --> 02:16:47,838
that Lord Naritsugu
fell ill and died.


864
02:16:49,310 --> 02:16:51,426
Some 23 years later,


865
02:16:51,536 --> 02:16:54,011
the Shogunate system was abolished.


866
02:16:54,147 --> 02:16:56,629
The modern Meiji era began.
