I teed you up
for a recruitment
pitch in Brazos,

599

and you gave me
an onion patch.

to mind, sir.

I'm supposed to
be getting out today.

Now they're shipping
me back to Iraq.

You understand
why it's important
we win over there?

605
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:58,183
Why we need
good soldiers
like you?

606
00:36:58,251 --> 00:36:59,685
Yes, sir.

607
00:36:59,753 --> 00:37:02,755
You have extenuating
circumstances?
You gay or pregnant?

608
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:08,327
Sir, you know me.
I'm a squared-away
soldier.

609
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:10,796
Because I have
an extenuating
circumstance, Sergeant.

610
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:12,765
It's called a war.
It's in Iraq.

611
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,567
I know, sir.
I volunteered
to fight in it.

612
00:37:15,635 --> 00:37:19,405
I ran over 150 combat
missions for you,
no complaint.

613
00:37:19,472 --> 00:37:23,242
Contract says
stop-loss is only
in a time of war.

614
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:25,044
This President said
the war's over,
so legally...

615
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:26,512
You a lawyer, son?

616
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:27,646
No, sir.

617
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:29,214
But after doing
right by this Army,

618
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:32,184
I'm getting burned
by some fine print
in a contract.

619
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:34,386
Now the President
himself said...
The President is also

620
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:36,155
the Commander-in-Chief.

621
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:39,124
I think he trumps
you either way.

622
00:37:39,192 --> 00:37:42,094
With all due respect, sir,
fuck the President!

623
00:37:45,031 --> 00:37:46,365
Fuck the President?

624
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:49,168
Yes, sir.
He's not over there
fighting this war.

625
00:37:49,235 --> 00:37:52,471
He's not there
seeing his buddies
burned alive in Humvees.

626
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:54,239
I lost three
men last month,

627
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:56,675
and I almost got
the rest of us killed.

628
00:37:56,743 --> 00:37:59,311
Those were my men, too,
and I lost more than that.

629

You're an excellent leader,
and you are going back.

631
00:38:04,217 --> 00:38:06,251
It won't come to that.
How do you know?

632
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:09,021
I think the President
trumps you in
this matter.

633
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:11,657
This, sir,
is bullshit,
and you know it!

634
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:19,965
Lieutenant, you just heard
Sergeant King disobey
a direct order.

635
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:22,835
Yes, sir.
I also perceive him
to be a flight risk.

636
00:38:22,902 --> 00:38:26,105
Escort him to
the stockade so he
can readjust his attitude.

637
00:38:26,172 --> 00:38:27,439
You're making
a big mistake.

I'm doing you
a big favor.

End of discussion.

00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,380

to the First Brigade when
it goes out on the 22nd.

01:16:48,108 --> 01:16:49,708
(BOTH LAUGH)
She sounds cute.

1186
01:16:51,945 --> 01:16:55,147
How're you feeling?
Feeling good, sir.

1187
01:16:55,215 --> 01:16:56,782
Just as comfy
as a Humvee.

1188
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,550
You think?

1189
01:16:58,618 --> 01:17:00,085
I wouldn't have thought,
but...

1190
01:17:00,153 --> 01:17:02,021
They taking good
care of you?

1191
01:17:02,088 --> 01:17:03,989
First-class
treatment, Sarge.

1192
01:17:04,057 --> 01:17:05,324
Good. So I don't have
to talk to anybody?

1193
01:17:05,392 --> 01:17:06,458
No, sir.

1194
01:17:06,526 --> 01:17:07,493
All right.

1195
01:17:16,069 --> 01:17:17,369
Nice break.

1196
01:17:17,437 --> 01:17:18,637
Thank you.

1197
01:17:27,714 --> 01:17:28,814
(LAUGHS)

1198
01:17:28,882 --> 01:17:30,049
That's impressive.

1199
01:17:30,116 --> 01:17:31,383
Sloppy.

1200
01:17:31,451 --> 01:17:33,185
What can I say?
You're in, though.

1201
01:17:33,253 --> 01:17:35,154
Come on.
I think she's
a butter face.

1202
01:17:35,221 --> 01:17:37,256
Yeah?
She's hot,
but her face.

1203
01:17:37,323 --> 01:17:38,691
But does she
give a good bath?

1204
01:17:38,758 --> 01:17:40,059
She's got
some soft hands.

1205
01:17:40,126 --> 01:17:42,428
Well, there you go.
That's what matters.

1206
01:17:42,495 --> 01:17:46,532
I haven't felt
anything else,
but that'll change.

1207
01:17:46,599 --> 01:17:49,435
Soon as I get
the rest of this.
All right.

1208
01:17:51,137 --> 01:17:55,107
Man, I had this thing,
like a dream, all right?

1209
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:57,509
You were at the bottom
of a swimming pool,

1210
01:17:57,577 --> 01:18:00,245
and I dove in to
try to save you.

1211
01:18:00,313 --> 01:18:01,780
But I couldn't.

1212
01:18:02,816 --> 01:18:04,249
It's okay, man.

1213
01:18:05,452 --> 01:18:06,752
You did save me.

1214
01:18:08,588 --> 01:18:09,755
I'm right here.

1215
01:18:11,891 --> 01:18:13,759
And seeing stuff, man?

1216
01:18:15,662 --> 01:18:17,229
Here, at night?

1217
01:18:19,065 --> 01:18:22,434
Sounds like
a fucking horror movie.

1218
01:18:22,502 --> 01:18:25,337
Guys screaming,
nightmares...

1219
01:18:28,441 --> 01:18:31,243
Sarge,
we got out
just in time.

1220
01:18:33,513 --> 01:18:35,748
I mean,
Haji's new bombs...

1221
01:18:37,417 --> 01:18:39,785
You don't want
to survive, man.

1222
01:18:39,853 --> 01:18:42,921
Sounds crazy,
but I feel lucky,
you know?

1223
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:48,060
They want to send me back.

1224
01:18:48,128 --> 01:18:50,696
I hope you told
them no fucking way.

1225
01:18:51,798 --> 01:18:54,333
I mean,
I might go back.

1226
01:18:54,401 --> 01:18:57,903
'Cause if I got killed,
my family would
get green cards.

1227
01:19:04,544 --> 01:19:05,811
Sir.
Yeah?

1228
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:07,846
Could you move
me out of the sun?

1229
01:19:07,914 --> 01:19:09,081
Okay.

1230
01:19:16,322 --> 01:19:20,426
So, I'm sorry,
but I got to ask.

1231
01:19:20,493 --> 01:19:24,096
What you doing
with Sergeant
Shriver's fiancee?

1232
01:19:24,164 --> 01:19:26,598
They broke up.
She's just giving me
a ride.

1233
01:19:29,102 --> 01:19:33,605
She was giving
you a ride before
or after they broke up?

1234
01:19:33,673 --> 01:19:34,707
Not like that.

1235
01:19:34,774 --> 01:19:36,608
Michelle's
close to my family.

1236
01:19:36,676 --> 01:19:38,577
She's just helping me out.
She's somebody...

1237
01:19:38,645 --> 01:19:40,479
(SHUSHING)

1238
01:19:40,547 --> 01:19:41,313
(LAUGHS)
What?

1239
01:19:44,651 --> 01:19:48,120
You should hear
the way you sound, Sarge.

1240
01:19:48,188 --> 01:19:51,056
You a Jody.

1241
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:55,160
It's time for you to
go back to your room,
Private Rodriguez.

1242
01:19:55,228 --> 01:19:57,663
# Jody got your girl
and gone #

1243
01:19:57,731 --> 01:19:58,831
Sing it.

1244
01:19:58,898 --> 01:20:00,432
I don't know
the words.
You sing it.

1245
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:04,570
# Ain't no use in going home
Jody got your girl and gone #

1246
01:20:04,637 --> 01:20:07,339
You watching this one?
Mmm-hmm.

1247
01:20:12,779 --> 01:20:14,780
Nice shot.
Now we're even.

1248
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:18,117
What you laughing at?
You lost.

1249
01:20:24,224 --> 01:20:25,758
That's pretty funny.

1250
01:20:25,825 --> 01:20:27,493
"Give you a hand."
Dumbass.

1251
01:20:31,765 --> 01:20:33,165
Help me push it.
Yeah.

1252
01:20:36,002 --> 01:20:37,236
Thank you.

1253
01:20:44,377 --> 01:20:46,178
It's fucking strong.
Is it?

1254
01:20:52,485 --> 01:20:53,952
I'll be in touch, Rico.

1255
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,220
Tell the boys I said,
"What's up?"

1256
01:20:55,288 --> 01:20:56,689
I will.

1257
01:21:07,967 --> 01:21:10,069
I signed up,

1258
01:21:10,136 --> 01:21:13,172
thinking I was
gonna go over there
and protect my country.

1259
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:14,306
My family.

1260
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:19,578
We wanted
payback for 9/11,

1261
01:21:19,646 --> 01:21:21,080
and you get there,

1262
01:21:21,147 --> 01:21:24,616
and you realize
the war wasn't even
about any of that.

1263
01:21:24,684 --> 01:21:26,018
The enemy ain't
out in the desert.

1264
01:21:26,086 --> 01:21:30,389
They're in
the hallways and rooftops,
living rooms, kitchens.

1265
01:21:31,925 --> 01:21:33,392
Everybody's got a weapon.

1266
01:21:34,394 --> 01:21:35,494
Everybody.

1267
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:38,364
Nobody knows who's who.

1268
01:21:38,431 --> 01:21:41,066
The only thing
you can believe in
is surviving.

1269
01:21:41,134 --> 01:21:45,304
Protecting
the guy to your left
and the guy to your right.

1270
01:21:45,372 --> 01:21:49,341
Side by side,
willing to die
for each other.

1271
01:21:52,545 --> 01:21:54,847
By the time
you start seeing

1272
01:21:56,683 --> 01:22:00,853
good friends'
bodies held together
by a belt after a car bomb,

1273
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:06,792
you get
a kill-or-be-killed
mentality.

1274
01:22:18,738 --> 01:22:20,072
It's okay.

1275
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:21,874
No, it ain't.

1276
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:27,513
Michelle, I'm worried
if I tell you these things,

1277
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:30,549
you're gonna think
differently of me,
and I...

1278
01:22:30,617 --> 01:22:33,218
I couldn't stand that.

1279
01:22:33,286 --> 01:22:35,220
I ain't gonna
think that.

Our last mission,

1282
01:22:43,797 --> 01:22:46,799
well, when Rico got hit,

1283
01:22:46,866 --> 01:22:50,736
I looked in his face,
and most of it
was burned off.

1284
01:22:55,275 --> 01:22:58,510
I had to go
in to get Steve.

I'm done with killing.

And I ain't leading
any more men into
a slaughter.

1289
01:23:51,664 --> 01:23:53,032
You have to
call Carlson.

1290
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:01,507
I know.

1292
01:24:29,402 --> 01:24:30,502

<i>All right.</i>
<i>What's the problem?</i>

1295
01:24:37,277 --> 01:24:40,479
I'm a Staff Sergeant,
a squad leader,

1296
01:24:40,547 --> 01:24:44,717
two tours,
Afghanistan and Iraq,
and I just got stop-lossed.

1297
01:24:44,784 --> 01:24:46,885
They're shipping me back
at the end of the month.

1298

<i>There's so many of</i>
<i>you guys out there.</i>

01:24:56,363 --> 01:24:59,531

01:25:04,237 --> 01:25:07,673
I can't go home.
I can't go back.
I got no other options.

01:25:10,477 --> 01:25:12,845
I need your services.
