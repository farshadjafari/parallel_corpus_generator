1
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:51,224
Your Highness...

2
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:56,863
There was a time, not very long ago,

3
00:00:56,948 --> 00:01:00,065
when we lived in an enchanted world

4
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:05,461
of elegant palaces and grand parties.

5
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:09,747
The year was 1916

6
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:12,977
and my son Nicholas

7
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:16,819
was the Czar of lmperial Russia.

8
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:29,021
Hello, darling.

9
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:35,456
We were celebrating the 300th anniversary
of our family's rule.

10
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:43,537
And, that night, no star burned brighter
than that of our sweet Anastasia,

11
00:01:43,628 --> 00:01:45,983
my youngest granddaughter.

12
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:51,138
She begged me not to return to Paris,

13
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:57,781
so I had a very special gift made for her
to make the separation easier for both of us.

14
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:01,502
For me? Is it ajewellery box?

15
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:04,908
Dimitri. You belong in the kitchen.

16
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:08,259
Look.

17
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:12,225
It plays our lullaby.

18
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:15,061
You can play it at night
before you go to sleep

19
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:17,537
and pretend that it's me singing.

20
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:23,463
On the wind

21
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:25,857
'Cross the sea

22
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:30,863
Hear this song and remember

23
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:36,144
Soon you'll be home with me

24
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:41,782
Once upon a December

25
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:45,819
Read what it says.

26
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:48,342
"Together in Paris."

27
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,903
Really? Oh, Grandmamma.

28
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:58,502
But we would never be together in Paris,

29
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:04,584
for a dark shadow had descended
upon the house of the Romanovs.

30
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:08,301
His name was Rasputin.

31
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,947
We thought he was a holy man,
but he was a fraud,

32
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:15,383
power-mad and dangerous.

33
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:17,584
How dare you return to the palace?

34
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:19,738
But I am your confidant.

35
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:21,341
Confidant? Hah!

36
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:23,703
You are a traitor. Get out!

37
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:27,019
You think you can banish the great Rasputin?

38
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:33,547
By the unholy powers vested in me,
I banish you with a curse.

39
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:36,859
Mark my words.

40
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:41,499
You and your family will die
within the fortnight.

41
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:48,544
I will not rest until I see the end
of the Romanov line for ever!

42
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:59,981
Consumed by his hatred
for Nicholas and his family,

43
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:04,459
Rasputin sold his soul
for the power to destroy them.

44
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:12,220
Go.

45
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:15,345
Fulfil your dark purpose

46
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:21,017
and seal the fate of the Czar and his family

47
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:23,303
once and for all.

48
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:28,779
From that moment on,
the spark of unhappiness in our country

49
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:34,386
was fanned into a flame
that would soon destroy our lives for ever.

50
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:39,345
- Help!
- Hurry, children.

51
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:41,783
- My music box.
- Anastasia!

52
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:44,459
Come back! Come back!

53
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:49,219
Anastasia...

54
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:57,784
- Please, hurry.
- Come this way. Out the servants' quarters.

55
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:02,100
- Hurry, Anastasia.
- Rasputin, she's getting away.

56
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:03,860
- My music box.
- Go! Go!

57
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:06,382
Comrades, in here!

58
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:09,028
Where are they, boy?

59
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:15,337
- Grandmamma...
- Keep up with me, darling.

60
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:21,262
- Rasputin!
- Let me go. Please!

61
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:25,421
You'll never escape me, child. Never!

62
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:33,024
Bartok!

63
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:34,382
Master!

64
00:05:41,628 --> 00:05:44,586
Anastasia, hurry. Hurry.

65
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,101
- Grandmamma!
- Here, take my hand.

66
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:54,261
- Hold onto my hand.
- Don't let go!

67
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,537
Anastasia.

68
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:01,224
Anastasia!

69
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:10,017
So many lives were destroyed that night.

70
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:14,783
What had always been
was now gone for ever.

71
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:20,142
And my Anastasia, my beloved grandchild,

72
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:23,743
I never saw her again.

73
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:58,019
Saint Petersburg is gloomy

74
00:06:58,108 --> 00:06:59,666
Saint Petersburg is bleak

75
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:03,661
My underwear got frozen
standing here all week

76
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:07,104
Since the Revolution
our lives have been so grey

77
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:10,339
Thank goodness for the gossip
that gets us through the day

78
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:14,697
Have you heard
there's a rumour in Saint Petersburg?

79
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:17,586
Have you heard
what they're saying on the street?

80
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:21,857
Although the Czar did not survive,
one daughter may be still alive

81
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:25,421
The Princess Anastasia

82
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:26,941
But please do not repeat

83
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:30,543
It's a rumour, a legend, a mystery

84
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:34,223
Something whispered in an alleyway
or through a crack

85
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:38,062
It's a rumour that's part of our history

86
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:41,504
They say her royal grandmamma
will pay a royal sum

87
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:45,501
To someone who can bring the princess back

88
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,259
- Vlad!
- Dimitri.

89
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:54,460
A rouble for this painting

90
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:56,504
It's Romanov, I swear

91
00:07:56,588 --> 00:08:00,422
Count Yusupov's pyjamas -
comrades, buy the pair

92
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:03,705
I got this from the palace,
it's lined with real fur

93
00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:07,497
It could be worth a fortune
if it belonged to her

94
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:12,738
Well, Dimitri, I got us a theatre.

95
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:16,104
Everything's going according to plan.
All we need is the girl.

96
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:19,578
Just think, Vlad, no more forging papers,
no more stolen goods.

97
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:24,947
We'll have three tickets out of here: One
for you, one for me and one for Anastasia.

98
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:29,338
It's the rumour, the legend, the mystery

99
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:33,023
It's the Princess Anastasia
who will help us fly

100
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:36,942
You and I, friend, will go down in history

101
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:40,665
We'll find a girl to play the part
and teach her what to say

102
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:44,703
Dress her up and take her to Paree

103
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:48,781
lmagine the reward
her dear old grandmamma will pay

104
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:52,019
Who else could pull it off but you and me?

105
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:53,826
- We'll be rich
- We'll be rich

106
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,899
- We'll be out
- We'll be out

107
00:08:55,988 --> 00:09:00,300
And Saint Petersburg
will have some more to talk about

108
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:07,505
Have you heard
there's a rumour in Saint Petersburg?

109
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,705
Have you heard
what they're saying on the street?

110
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:21,377
Have you heard
there's a rumour in Saint Petersburg?

111
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:24,540
Have you heard?
Comrades, what do you suppose?

112
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:28,741
- A fascinating mystery
- The biggest con in history

113
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:35,779
The Princess Anastasia

114
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,985
Alive or dead?

115
00:09:39,548 --> 00:09:41,539
Who knows? Sh!

116
00:09:50,468 --> 00:09:53,426
I got you ajob in the fish factory.

117
00:09:53,508 --> 00:09:57,467
You go down this path till you get to
the fork in the road. Go left...

118
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:58,264
Bye!

119
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,623
- Are you listening?
- Bye, everybody!

120
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,461
I'm listening, Comrade Phlegmenkoff.

121
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:07,461
You've been a thorn in my side
since you were brought here.

122
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:12,576
Acting like the Queen of Sheba
instead of the nameless no-account you are.

123
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:17,106
For the last ten years, I've fed you,
I've clothed you, I've...

124
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:19,179
Kept a roof over my head.

125
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:25,298
How is it you don't have a clue
who you were before you came to us,

126
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:27,185
but you can remember all that?

127
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:30,260
- I do have a clue to...
- Ach! I know.

128
00:10:30,348 --> 00:10:32,816
"Together in Paris."

129
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:37,379
So, you want to go to France
to find your family?

130
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:43,380
Little Miss Anya,
it's time to take your place in life.

131
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,459
In life and in line.

132
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:47,425
And be grateful, too.

133
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:50,219
"Together in Paris"!

134
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:56,739
Be grateful.

135
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:01,742
"Be grateful, Anya."

136
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,820
I am grateful. Grateful to get away!

137
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:08,787
"Go left" she says.

138
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:13,658
Well, I know what's to the left.
I'll be "Anya the orphan" for ever.

139
00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:18,265
But if I go right, maybe I could find...

140
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:22,667
Whoever gave me this necklace
must have loved me.

141
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:28,061
This is crazy. Me? Go to Paris?

142
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:32,859
Send me a sign!

143
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,585
A hint!

144
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,019
Anything!

145
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,542
I don't have time to play right now, OK?
I'm waiting for a sign.

146
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:53,979
Would you please leave me alone?
Gimme that back.

147
00:11:58,588 --> 00:12:02,297
Oh, great. A dog wants me
to go to Saint Petersburg.

148
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:09,017
OK, I can take a hint.

149
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:21,982
Heart, don't fail me now

150
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:24,942
Courage, don't desert me

151
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:26,427
Don't turn back

152
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:29,386
Now that we're here

153
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,467
People always say

154
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:35,108
Life is full of choices

155
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:39,784
No one ever mentions fear

156
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:45,147
Or how the world can seem so vast

157
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,417
On ajourney

158
00:12:49,508 --> 00:12:55,219
To the past

159
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:03,417
Somewhere down this road

160
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:06,227
I know someone's waiting

161
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:10,665
Years of dreams just can't be wrong

162
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:13,502
Arms will open wide

163
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:16,148
I'll be safe and wanted

164
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:20,062
Finally home where I belong

165
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:22,663
Well, starting now

166
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:25,740
I'm learning fast

167
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,420
On this journey

168
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:35,937
To the past

169
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:45,978
Home, love, family

170
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:50,778
There was once a time
I must have had them, too

171
00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:56,184
Home, love, family

172
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,543
I will never be complete

173
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:03,702
Until I find you

174
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:07,227
One step at a time

175
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:09,822
One hope, then another

176
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:14,823
Who knows where this road may go?

177
00:14:14,908 --> 00:14:17,342
Back to who I was

178
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:19,737
On to find my future

179
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:23,980
Things my heart still needs to know

180
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:27,540
Yes, let this be a sign

181
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,823
Let this road be mine

182
00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:34,060
Let it lead me to my past

183
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:38,063
And bring me home

184
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:46,897
At last

185
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:56,267
- One ticket to Paris, please.
- Exit visa.

186
00:14:56,868 --> 00:15:00,463
- Exit visa?
- No exit visa, no ticket!

187
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:08,066
See Dimitri. He can help.

188
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:12,137
- Where can I find him?
- At the old palace.

189
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:14,537
But you didn't hear it from me.

190
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:17,858
- Go, go, go.
- Dimitri...

191
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:20,739
Nice. Nice. Very nice.

192
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:23,217
- And I look like princess.
- OK...

193
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:27,267
- I dance like a feather.
- Thank you. Thank you. Next, please.

194
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:33,059
Grandma, it's me.

195
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:35,459
Anastasia.

196
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:39,259
Oh, brother.

197
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:43,144
That's it, Dimitri. Game over.

198
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:46,743
Our last kopeck gone
for this flea-infested theatre

199
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:49,661
and still no girl to pretend to be Anastasia.

200
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:53,263
We'll find her, Vlad.
She's here somewhere, right under our noses.

201
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:57,785
One look at this jewellery box, the Empress
will think we have the real Anastasia.

202
00:15:57,868 --> 00:16:00,382
- I'm looking for...
- Before she catches on,

203
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:03,460
we'll be off spending the 10 million roubles.

204
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:17,379
Pooka.

205
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:20,459
Pooka.

206
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,979
Pooka, where are you?

207
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:29,062
- Did you hear something?
- No.

208
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:41,859
Hello?

209
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:43,939
Anybody home?

210
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:27,539
This place.

211
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:29,786
It's...

212
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:32,302
It's like a memory from a dream.

213
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:38,657
Dancing bears

214
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:40,739
Painted wings

215
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:46,343
Things I almost remember

216
00:17:46,428 --> 00:17:48,623
And a song

217
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:51,263
Someone sings

218
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:56,418
Once upon a December

219
00:17:56,788 --> 00:18:01,145
Someone holds me safe and warm

220
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:06,383
Horses prance through a silver storm

221
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:11,419
Figures dancing gracefully

222
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:16,536
Across my memory

223
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:50,058
Someone holds me safe and warm

224
00:18:50,388 --> 00:18:54,666
Horses prance through a silver storm

225
00:18:54,988 --> 00:18:59,345
Figures dancing gracefully

226
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:04,183
Across my memory

227
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:09,498
Far away, long ago

228
00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:14,218
Glowing dim as an ember

229
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:19,018
Things my heart used to know

230
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:25,377
Things it yearns to remember

231
00:19:26,188 --> 00:19:28,543
And a song

232
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:33,702
Someone sings

233
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:43,906
Once upon a December

234
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,939
What are you doin' in here?

235
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:08,463
Stop! Stop, stop, stop.

236
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:10,539
Hold on a minute. Hold on.

237
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:15,981
Now, how did you get in here?

238
00:20:25,668 --> 00:20:27,067
Excuse me, child...

239
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:29,537
Vlad, do you see what I see?

240
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:31,501
No.

241
00:20:32,588 --> 00:20:35,102
Yes. Yes!

242
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:37,897
- Are you Dimitri?
- Cute.

243
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:41,182
Perhaps. Depends on who's looking for him.

244
00:20:41,268 --> 00:20:44,226
My name is Anya. I need travel papers.

245
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:48,017
They say you're the man to see,
even though I can't tell you who said that.

246
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:50,224
And what... Hey, why are you circling me?

247
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:53,983
- What, were you a vulture in another life?
- I'm sorry, Anneya.

248
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:56,298
- It's Anya.
- Anya.

249
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,380
It's just that you look an awful lot like...

250
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:04,466
Never mind. Now, you said
something about travel papers?

251
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:07,938
Yes. I'd like to go to Paris.

252
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:11,100
- You'd like to go to Paris?
- Who is this here?

253
00:21:11,588 --> 00:21:13,738
- Look. He likes me.
- Nice dog.

254
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:18,303
Now, let me ask you something...
Anya, was it?

255
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:22,461
- There's a last name that goes with that?
- Well, actually...

256
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:26,018
This is gonna sound crazy.
I don't know my last name.

257
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:29,657
I was found wandering around
when I was eight years old.

258
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,023
And before that? Before you were eight?

259
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:36,340
I know it's strange, but I don't remember.
I have very few memories of my past.

260
00:21:36,668 --> 00:21:39,023
Hm. That's perfect.

261
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:41,622
I do have one clue, however.
And that is Paris.

262
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,141
Paris?

263
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:45,696
Right. So can you two help me or not?

264
00:21:46,548 --> 00:21:48,186
Vlad, Vlad, tickets.

265
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:53,137
Sure would like to. In fact, oddly enough,
we're going to Paris ourselves.

266
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:58,267
And I've got three... Well, this one is...
But I've got three tickets here.

267
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:00,816
Unfortunately, the third one is for her.

268
00:22:00,908 --> 00:22:03,297
Anastasia.

269
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:08,227
We are going to reunite the Grand Duchess
Anastasia with her grandmother.

270
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:11,425
- You do kind of resemble her.
- The same blue eyes.

271
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:13,942
- The Romanov eyes.
- Nicholas' smile.

272
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:16,098
- Alexandra's chin.
- Oh, look.

273
00:22:16,188 --> 00:22:18,941
She even has the grandmother's hands.

274
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:21,303
She's the same age, the same physical type.

275
00:22:21,388 --> 00:22:24,380
Are you trying to tell me
you think that I am Anastasia?

276
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,346
I've seen thousands of girls
all over the country.

277
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:30,659
Not one of them looks as much like
the Grand Duchess as you.

278
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:33,216
- Look at the portrait.
- I knew you were crazy.

279
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:35,822
- But now I think you are both mad.
- Why?

280
00:22:35,908 --> 00:22:39,298
- You don't remember what happened to you.
- No one knows what happened to her.

281
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:41,424
You're looking for family, in Paris.

282
00:22:41,508 --> 00:22:43,863
And her only family is in Paris.

283
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:46,098
Have you ever thought about the possibility?

284
00:22:46,188 --> 00:22:48,179
That I could be royalty?

285
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,859
Well, it's kind of hard
to think of yourself as a duchess

286
00:22:53,948 --> 00:22:56,257
when you're sleeping on a damp floor.

287
00:22:56,348 --> 00:22:59,704
But, sure, every lonely girl
would hope she's a princess.

288
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:03,576
And, somewhere, one little girl is.

289
00:23:05,148 --> 00:23:09,903
After all, the name Anastasia means
"she will rise again".

290
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:14,220
Wish we could help, but the third ticket
is for the Grand Duchess Anastasia.

291
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:16,659
Good luck.

292
00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:21,941
Why didn't you tell her
about our brilliant plan?

293
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:26,579
All she wants to do is go to Paris.
Why give away a third of the reward money?

294
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:28,818
I tell you, we're walking away too soon.

295
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,581
Not to worry. I got it all under control.

296
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:34,383
All right, walk a little slower.

297
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,864
Three, two, one...

298
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:52,941
- Dimitri!
- Right in the palm of our hand.

299
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:55,781
- Dimitri, wait!
- Did you call me?

300
00:23:55,868 --> 00:24:00,623
If I don't remember who I am, then who's
to say I'm not a princess or a duchess, right?

301
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:02,343
Go on.

302
00:24:02,428 --> 00:24:05,465
If I'm not Anastasia,
the Empress will know right away.

303
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:08,267
- So it's just an honest mistake.
- Sounds plausible.

304
00:24:08,668 --> 00:24:11,546
But, if you are the princess,

305
00:24:11,628 --> 00:24:15,746
then you'll finally know who you are
and have your family back.

306
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:17,819
You know, he's right.

307
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:20,502
- Either way, it gets you to Paris.
- Right.

308
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:29,302
May I present Her Royal Highness,
the Grand Duchess Anastasia?

309
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:33,943
- Pooka, we are going to Paris.
- No, the dog stays.

310
00:24:34,028 --> 00:24:36,781
- What are you saying? The dog goes.
- The dog does not go.

311
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:38,824
- I say he's going.
- I'm allergic to dogs.

312
00:24:39,548 --> 00:24:44,747
Anastasia? You have just one problem there,
fellah. Anastasia's dead.

313
00:24:44,828 --> 00:24:47,706
All the Romanovs are dead. They're dead.

314
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:49,779
Dead, dead, dead.

315
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:53,019
Am I right, my friend?
I mean, how could that be Ana...

316
00:24:58,268 --> 00:25:03,296
Oh, come on. Am I supposed to believe
that thing woke up after all these years

317
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:06,425
just because some guy
claims she's a Romanov?

318
00:25:07,988 --> 00:25:13,267
OK, OK, I get the message. Enough already
with the glowing and the smoke people.

319
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:22,417
If that thing's come back to life,
it must mean Anastasia's alive.

320
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:24,703
- Leave the dog.
- I am not leaving the dog.

321
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:27,177
- And that's her.
- We've got a train to catch.

322
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,105
Mayday! Mayday!

323
00:25:45,428 --> 00:25:47,419
It's hot!

324
00:25:54,228 --> 00:25:56,139
Oh, boy.

325
00:25:56,228 --> 00:25:59,300
Ow! I tell you what... Ow!

326
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:02,542
Who dares intrude on my solitude?

327
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:07,219
Get out! Out!

328
00:26:08,348 --> 00:26:11,067
Bartok? Is that you?

329
00:26:15,268 --> 00:26:17,702
Master? You're alive?

330
00:26:17,788 --> 00:26:20,348
Yes. In a manner of speaking.

331
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:23,667
Whoa, that fell right out there, sir.

332
00:26:24,388 --> 00:26:26,948
- Something's happened.
- Yeah.

333
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:30,018
- Whoopsie.
- I knew it.

334
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:33,578
I could feel the dark forces stirring.

335
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:36,740
I'm not surprised, because I saw her.
Anastasia.

336
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,137
Anastasia? Alive?

337
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:41,739
Sir, your lips, they're...

338
00:26:41,828 --> 00:26:44,388
That Romanov brat!

339
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:48,347
Ain't that the kick in the head?
I guess a curse just ain't what it used to be.

340
00:26:48,428 --> 00:26:51,625
That's why I was stuck here in limbo.

341
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:54,097
My curse is unfulfilled.

342
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:03,179
Look at me.

343
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:05,619
I am falling apart.

344
00:27:07,748 --> 00:27:09,978
I'm a wreck!

345
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:14,858
Actually, considering how long
you've been dead, you look pretty good.

346
00:27:15,828 --> 00:27:18,422
- Sir, you do. You do.
- Really?

347
00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:21,545
Sir, is this the face of a bat
who would lie to you?

348
00:27:22,188 --> 00:27:25,544
Come on, for a minute there,
you had your old spark back.

349
00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:30,258
If only I hadn't lost the gift
from the dark forces.

350
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:33,428
The key to my powers.

351
00:27:33,508 --> 00:27:36,102
What? You mean this reliquary?

352
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,703
- Where did you get that?
- Oh, I found it.

353
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:42,825
- Give it to me!
- All right, all right. Don't get so grabby.

354
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:45,297
My old friend.

355
00:27:45,388 --> 00:27:47,060
Together again.

356
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:53,063
Now my dark purpose will be fulfilled.

357
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:58,268
And the last of the Romanovs will die!

358
00:27:59,028 --> 00:28:01,747
In the dark of the night
I was tossing and turning

359
00:28:03,188 --> 00:28:05,986
And the nightmare I had was as bad as can be

360
00:28:07,948 --> 00:28:10,064
It scared me out of my wits

361
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:12,139
A corpse falling to bits

362
00:28:12,228 --> 00:28:15,459
Then I opened my eyes
and the nightmare was me

363
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,381
I was once the most
mystical man in all Russia

364
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:23,707
When the royals betrayed me
they made a mistake

365
00:28:25,668 --> 00:28:27,659
My curse made each of them pay

366
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,739
But one little girl got away

367
00:28:29,828 --> 00:28:33,867
Little Anya beware, Rasputin's awake

368
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:38,341
In the dark of the night, evil will find her

369
00:28:38,748 --> 00:28:41,979
In the dark of the night, just before dawn

370
00:28:42,908 --> 00:28:44,899
Revenge will be sweet

371
00:28:44,988 --> 00:28:47,548
When the curse is complete

372
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:50,904
- In the dark of the night
- She'll be gone!

373
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:54,183
Hi, ladies. Listen, I...

374
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:57,305
I can feel that my powers are slowly returning

375
00:28:58,468 --> 00:29:02,097
Tie my sash,
add a dash of cologne for that smell

376
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:05,223
As the pieces fall into place

377
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:07,299
I'll see her crawl into place

378
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:09,739
Do svidaniya, Anya, Your Grace

379
00:29:09,828 --> 00:29:11,784
Farewell

380
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:16,498
- In the dark of the night, terror will strike her
- Terror's the least I can do!

381
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,661
In the dark of the night, evil will brew

382
00:29:20,748 --> 00:29:22,500
Soon she will feel

383
00:29:22,588 --> 00:29:25,102
That her nightmares are real

384
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:26,701
In the dark of the night

385
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:28,779
She'll be through!

386
00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:32,700
In the dark of the night, evil will find her

387
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:34,141
Find her

388
00:29:34,228 --> 00:29:37,186
In the dark of the night, terror comes through

389
00:29:37,268 --> 00:29:40,180
- Doom her
- My dear, here's a sign

390
00:29:40,268 --> 00:29:42,862
It's the end of the line

391
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,904
In the dark of the night

392
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:47,297
In the dark of the night

393
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:49,538
Come, my minions

394
00:29:49,628 --> 00:29:51,698
Rise for your master

395
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:54,700
Let your evil shine

396
00:29:54,788 --> 00:29:56,380
In the dark of the night

397
00:29:56,468 --> 00:29:57,742
Find her now

398
00:29:57,828 --> 00:30:00,706
Yes, fly ever faster

399
00:30:00,788 --> 00:30:04,337
In the dark of the night
In the dark of the night

400
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:07,181
She'll be mine!

401
00:30:31,148 --> 00:30:33,423
Oh. The mutt gets the window seat.

402
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:41,741
Stop fiddling with that. Sit up straight.
Remember, you're a grand duchess.

403
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:44,422
How do you know
what grand duchesses do or don't do?

404
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:46,897
I make it my business to know.

405
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:50,502
Look, Anya, I'm just trying to help, all right?

406
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:55,417
Dimitri, do you really think I'm royalty?

407
00:30:55,508 --> 00:30:58,784
- You know I do.
- Then stop bossing me around.

408
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:02,703
She certainly has a mind of her own.

409
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,822
Yeah. I hate that in a woman.

410
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:23,584
- Look, I think we got off on the wrong foot.
- I think we did too.

411
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:26,057
- But I appreciate your apology.
- Apology?

412
00:31:26,148 --> 00:31:28,218
An apology? I was just saying...

413
00:31:28,308 --> 00:31:31,664
Please, don't talk any more.
It's only gonna upset me.

414
00:31:31,748 --> 00:31:34,945
- Fine. I'll be quiet, if you will.
- All right, I'll be quiet.

415
00:31:35,028 --> 00:31:35,619
- Fine.
- Fine.

416
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,699
- Fine.
- Fine.

417
00:31:39,068 --> 00:31:41,662
- Think you'll miss it?
- Miss what, your talking?

418
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:43,943
No. Russia.

419
00:31:44,948 --> 00:31:46,939
- Nope.
- But it was your home.

420
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:49,098
It was a place I once lived.

421
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:51,383
Then you plan on making Paris your home?

422
00:31:51,468 --> 00:31:53,459
What is it with you and homes?

423
00:31:53,548 --> 00:31:57,257
Well, for one thing,
it's something every normal person wants.

424
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,543
- For another thing, you...
- What?

425
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:02,188
- Just forget it.
- Fine.

426
00:32:02,828 --> 00:32:05,900
Thank goodness it's you.
Please, remove him from my sight.

427
00:32:05,988 --> 00:32:08,786
- What have you done to her?
- Me? It's her.

428
00:32:12,148 --> 00:32:14,537
An unspoken attraction.

429
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:18,462
Attraction? That skinny little brat?
Have you lost your mind?

430
00:32:18,548 --> 00:32:22,507
- Only asking a simple question.
- Attraction. Ridiculous.

431
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,985
Last month, the travelling papers were blue.

432
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:42,059
But now they are red.

433
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:45,663
Papers. Papers, please.

434
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:51,703
It's what I hate about this government.

435
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:53,858
- Everything's in red.
- Red?

436
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:57,739
I propose we move to the baggage car
before the guards come.

437
00:32:57,828 --> 00:32:59,819
I propose we get off this train.

438
00:33:12,628 --> 00:33:14,778
Sorry. I thought you were someone else.

439
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,257
Oh, it's you. Well, that's OK then.

440
00:33:17,348 --> 00:33:19,339
- We've got to go.
- Where are we going?

441
00:33:19,428 --> 00:33:21,339
I think you broke my nose.

442
00:33:21,428 --> 00:33:23,419
Men are such babies.

443
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:29,982
Yes. Yes, this will do nicely.

444
00:33:31,188 --> 00:33:34,180
- She'll freeze in here.
- She can thaw in Paris.

445
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:39,467
The baggage car? There's nothing
wrong with our papers, is there, maestro?

446
00:33:39,548 --> 00:33:41,539
Of course not, Your Grace.

447
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:47,146
It's just that I hate to see you forced
to mingle with all those commoners.

448
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,063
- What was that?
- I don't know.

449
00:33:57,148 --> 00:33:59,184
But there goes the dining car.

450
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:02,499
- Get off of me!
- I'm trying.

451
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:07,096
- Uh, Dimitri.
- What?

452
00:34:07,188 --> 00:34:10,498
I think someone has flambéed our engine.

453
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:15,619
Something's not right.

454
00:34:17,788 --> 00:34:19,779
Wait here. I'll check it out.

455
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,576
Anybody here?

456
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:33,259
We're going way too fast!

457
00:34:34,388 --> 00:34:37,425
Nobody's driving this train.
We're gonna have to jump.

458
00:34:38,908 --> 00:34:40,899
Did you say jump?

459
00:34:42,188 --> 00:34:46,466
- After you.
- Fine. Then we'll uncouple the car.

460
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,902
Come on! I need a wrench, an axe, anything.

461
00:34:56,668 --> 00:34:58,659
Here.

462
00:35:06,468 --> 00:35:09,778
Come on, there's gotta be
something in there better than this.

463
00:35:09,868 --> 00:35:11,426
That'll work.

464
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:14,706
Go, go, go!

465
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,064
What did they teach you in the orphanage?

466
00:35:22,908 --> 00:35:24,899
The brakes are out!

467
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:27,738
Turn harder!

468
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:32,902
Don't worry. We've got plenty of track.
We'll just coast to a stop.

469
00:35:40,668 --> 00:35:41,896
You were saying?

470
00:35:44,348 --> 00:35:46,942
I got an idea, Vlad. Gimme a hand with this.

471
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:53,858
Hand me the chain.

472
00:35:53,948 --> 00:35:56,223
- Not you!
- Vlad's busy at the moment.

473
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:12,538
And to think that could have been you.

474
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,221
If we live through this,
remind me to thank you.

475
00:36:20,028 --> 00:36:22,462
Here goes nothin'. Brace yourselves.

476
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:37,263
Well, this is our stop.

477
00:36:56,988 --> 00:37:00,776
I hate trains.
Remind me never to get on the train again.

478
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:07,346
Wow.

479
00:37:07,428 --> 00:37:11,546
Take it easy there. Sir, really,
you should watch your blood pressure.

480
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:14,984
My nephew, lzzie,
just keeled over one day, mid-mango.

481
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,986
Stress, it's a killer, sir. And he's a fruit bat.

482
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:21,059
No meat. No blood, even.

483
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:24,739
How could they let her escape?

484
00:37:25,428 --> 00:37:28,386
You're right. It's very upsetting, sir.

485
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:30,459
I guess this reliquary's broken.

486
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:33,979
You idiot!

487
00:37:40,948 --> 00:37:45,738
All right now, sir. Take it easy there. Just
remember what I said to you about stress.

488
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:47,898
I sold my soul for this.

489
00:37:49,748 --> 00:37:52,785
My life, my very existence, depends on it.

490
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:56,577
And you almost destroyed it.

491
00:37:56,668 --> 00:37:59,705
I get it. I get it. You break it, you bought it.

492
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:04,100
See that you remember,
you miserable rodent!

493
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:08,857
Sure, blame the bat. We're easy targets.

494
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:10,939
What are you muttering about?

495
00:38:11,028 --> 00:38:14,464
Anastasia, sir.
Just wishing I could do the job for you, sir.

496
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:16,539
I'd give her a... And a...

497
00:38:17,188 --> 00:38:18,860
And then a...

498
00:38:18,948 --> 00:38:21,178
And I'd kick her, sir.

499
00:38:21,268 --> 00:38:23,828
Oh, I have something else in mind.

500
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:26,217
Something more enticing.

501
00:38:26,308 --> 00:38:29,778
Something really cruel.

502
00:38:37,868 --> 00:38:42,066
- Are we gonna walk to Paris?
- We'll take a boat in Germany.

503
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:45,458
- Then we're walking to Germany?
- No, Your Grace, we're taking a bus.

504
00:38:45,548 --> 00:38:47,539
A bus.

505
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:49,859
That's nice.

506
00:38:50,308 --> 00:38:52,299
Sophie, my dear!

507
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:54,945
Vlady's on his way!

508
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:59,906
- Who's Sophie?
- Who's Sophie? She's a tender little morsel.

509
00:38:59,988 --> 00:39:03,298
A cup of hot chocolate
after a long walk in the snow.

510
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:05,299
Vlad, ix-nay on the Ophie-say.

511
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:10,098
She's a decadent pastry
filled with whipped cream and laughter.

512
00:39:10,188 --> 00:39:15,137
- Is this a person or a cream puff?
- She is the Empress' ravishing first cousin.

513
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:19,744
But I thought we were going to see
the Empress herself.

514
00:39:19,828 --> 00:39:22,217
Why are we going to see her cousin?

515
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:24,547
Dimitri?

516
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:29,099
Well, nobody gets near the Dowager Empress
without convincing Sophie first.

517
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,302
Oh, no. Not me. No.

518
00:39:32,388 --> 00:39:36,222
Nobody told me I had to prove
I was the Grand Duchess.

519
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:38,538
- Look...
- Show up, yes. Look nice, fine.

520
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:42,382
- But lie?
- You don't know it's a lie. What if it's true?

521
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:46,537
OK, so it's one more stop on the road
to finding out who you are.

522
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:49,825
I thought this was something
you had to see through to the end.

523
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:53,901
Look at me, Dimitri. I am not exactly
grand duchess material here.

524
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:05,177
Tell me, child. What do you see?

525
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:10,863
I see a skinny little nobody
with no past and no future.

526
00:40:12,988 --> 00:40:16,901
I see an engaging and fiery young woman,

527
00:40:16,988 --> 00:40:22,187
who, on occasion, has shown a regal
command equal to any royal in the world.

528
00:40:24,028 --> 00:40:27,179
And I have known my share of royalty.

529
00:40:28,548 --> 00:40:30,539
You see, my dear,

530
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:34,462
I was a member of the lmperial Court.

531
00:40:39,748 --> 00:40:44,060
So, are you ready to become
the Grand Duchess Anastasia?

532
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:48,576
- What?
- There is nothing left for you back there.

533
00:40:49,428 --> 00:40:52,067
Everything is in Paris.

534
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:59,467
Gentlemen, start your teaching.

535
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:01,700
I remember it well.

536
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:05,504
You were born in a palace by the sea

537
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,907
A palace by the sea?

538
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:08,979
- Could it be?
- Yes, that's right.

539
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:11,946
You rode horseback
when you were only three.

540
00:41:12,028 --> 00:41:13,825
Horseback riding? Me?

541
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,899
- And the horse...
- He was white.

542
00:41:15,988 --> 00:41:20,425
- You made faces and terrorised the cook
- Threw him in the brook

543
00:41:20,508 --> 00:41:22,339
- Was I wild?
- Wrote the book.

544
00:41:22,428 --> 00:41:25,306
But you'd behave
when your father gave that look

545
00:41:25,388 --> 00:41:28,346
- Imagine how it was
- Your long-forgotten past

546
00:41:28,428 --> 00:41:31,738
We've lots and lots to teach you
And the time is going fast

547
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:34,383
All right. I'm ready.

548
00:41:34,468 --> 00:41:37,699
- Now shoulders back and stand up tall
- And do not walk, but try to float.

549
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:41,098
- I feel a little foolish. Am I floating?
- Like a little boat.

550
00:41:41,188 --> 00:41:42,416
- You give a bow
- What happens now?

551
00:41:42,508 --> 00:41:44,146
Your hand receives a kiss

552
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:47,106
Most of all, remember this

553
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:50,066
If I can learn to do it, you can learn to do it

554
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:53,505
- Something in you knows it
- There's nothing to it

555
00:41:53,588 --> 00:41:56,500
Follow in my footsteps, shoe by shoe

556
00:41:56,868 --> 00:41:59,143
You can learn to do it, too

557
00:41:59,668 --> 00:42:02,501
- Now elbows in and sit up straight.
- And never slurp the stroganoff.

558
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:05,785
- I never cared for stroganoff.
- She said that like a Romanov.

559
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:07,142
- The samovar.
- The caviar.

560
00:42:07,228 --> 00:42:08,946
Dessert and then good night?

561
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:11,781
Not until you get this right

562
00:42:11,868 --> 00:42:15,224
If I can learn to do it, you can learn to do it

563
00:42:15,308 --> 00:42:18,220
Pull yourself together
and you'll pull through it

564
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:21,665
Tell yourself it's easy and it's true

565
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:24,103
You can learn to do it, too

566
00:42:24,948 --> 00:42:27,940
Next, we memorise the names of the royalty.

567
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:29,381
Now here we have Kropotkin

568
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:31,220
- Shot Potemkin
- In the Botkin

569
00:42:31,308 --> 00:42:33,299
And dear old Uncle Vanya loved his vodka

570
00:42:33,388 --> 00:42:34,218
- Got it, Anya?
- No.

571
00:42:34,308 --> 00:42:36,105
- The Baron Pushkin
- He was short

572
00:42:36,188 --> 00:42:37,337
- Count Anatoly
- Had a wart

573
00:42:37,428 --> 00:42:39,100
- Count Sergei
- Wore a feathered hat

574
00:42:39,188 --> 00:42:40,780
I hear he's gotten very fat

575
00:42:40,868 --> 00:42:42,859
And I recall his yellow cat

576
00:42:43,748 --> 00:42:45,739
I don't believe we told her that.

577
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:50,939
If you can learn to do it, I can learn to do it

578
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:54,225
- Don't know how you knew it
- I simply knew it

579
00:42:54,308 --> 00:42:57,106
Suddenly I feel like someone new

580
00:42:57,588 --> 00:43:00,056
Anya, you're a dream come true

581
00:43:00,148 --> 00:43:02,867
- If I can learn to do it
- You can learn to do it

582
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:05,178
- You can learn to do it
- Pull yourself together

583
00:43:05,268 --> 00:43:06,747
And you'll pull through it

584
00:43:06,828 --> 00:43:09,820
- Tell yourself it's easy
- And it's true

585
00:43:09,908 --> 00:43:12,741
- You can learn to do it
- Nothing to it

586
00:43:12,828 --> 00:43:18,061
You can learn to do it, too

587
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:29,059
Here. I bought you a dress.

588
00:43:30,868 --> 00:43:33,382
You bought me a tent.

589
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:39,706
- What are you lookin' for?
- The Russian Circus. I think it's still in here.

590
00:43:40,148 --> 00:43:42,503
Come on. Just put it on.

591
00:43:53,868 --> 00:43:55,096
Checkmate.

592
00:44:02,228 --> 00:44:04,025
Wonderful!

593
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,905
Marvellous!

594
00:44:07,548 --> 00:44:10,984
And now you are dressed for a ball.

595
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:13,502
And you will learn to dance for one as well.

596
00:44:13,588 --> 00:44:15,579
Dimitri...

597
00:44:15,668 --> 00:44:17,659
I'm... I'm not very good at it.

598
00:44:19,108 --> 00:44:20,063
And...

599
00:44:21,348 --> 00:44:23,339
One, two, three. One, two, three.

600
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:26,226
No. Anya, you don't lead. Let him.

601
00:44:33,228 --> 00:44:35,423
That dress is really beautiful.

602
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:38,068
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

603
00:44:39,348 --> 00:44:42,385
It was nice on the hanger,
but it looks even better on you.

604
00:44:42,468 --> 00:44:45,266
- You should wear it.
- I am wearing it.

605
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:47,339
Right. Of course.

606
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:49,859
I'm just trying to give you a...

607
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:52,459
Compliment?

608
00:44:52,548 --> 00:44:54,539
Of course. Yes.

609
00:44:58,188 --> 00:45:01,737
It's one, two, three and suddenly

610
00:45:01,828 --> 00:45:04,342
I see it at a glance

611
00:45:04,428 --> 00:45:10,663
She's radiant and confident
and born to take this chance

612
00:45:10,748 --> 00:45:13,626
I taught her well, I planned it all

613
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:17,098
I just forgot romance

614
00:45:19,068 --> 00:45:21,502
Vlad, how could you do this?

615
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:25,703
How will we get through this?

616
00:45:25,788 --> 00:45:32,227
I never should have let them dance

617
00:45:36,988 --> 00:45:39,218
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

618
00:45:39,788 --> 00:45:42,063
- Kind of light-headed?
- Yeah.

619
00:45:43,068 --> 00:45:44,660
Me too.

620
00:45:44,748 --> 00:45:46,739
Probably from spinning.

621
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:51,176
Maybe we should stop.

622
00:45:51,268 --> 00:45:53,259
We have stopped.

623
00:45:54,388 --> 00:45:56,379
- Anya, I...
- Yes?

624
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,419
You're doing fine.

625
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:25,685
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Fine.

626
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:28,281
Just riddled with envy. Look at him.

627
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:31,082
He can sleep through anything.

628
00:46:44,727 --> 00:46:46,718
Pretty jewellery box, isn't it?

629
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:48,798
Jewellery box?

630
00:46:48,887 --> 00:46:50,878
Are you sure that's what it is?

631
00:46:50,967 --> 00:46:52,958
What else could it be?

632
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:56,520
Something else. Something special.

633
00:46:57,527 --> 00:46:59,518
Something to do with a secret.

634
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:05,284
- Is that possible?
- Anything's possible.

635
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:07,722
You taught Dimitri how to waltz, didn't you?

636
00:47:16,727 --> 00:47:18,957
Sleep well, Your Majesty.

637
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:29,238
Sweet dreams, Pooka.

638
00:47:31,647 --> 00:47:33,797
There she is, master.

639
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,447
Sound asleep in her little bed.

640
00:47:36,527 --> 00:47:39,360
And pleasant dreams to you,

641
00:47:39,447 --> 00:47:41,438
Princess.

642
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:44,756
I'll get inside your mind,

643
00:47:44,847 --> 00:47:47,486
where you can't escape me.

644
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:54,078
Come on.

645
00:49:12,127 --> 00:49:13,685
What? What? What?

646
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:16,158
Pooka. Pooka, what?

647
00:49:17,527 --> 00:49:19,245
Anya! Anya!

648
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:26,085
Anya!

649
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:38,805
Hello, sunshine.

650
00:49:39,887 --> 00:49:41,081
Hello!

651
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:42,919
Jump in. Jump!

652
00:49:50,807 --> 00:49:52,399
Anya!

653
00:49:59,647 --> 00:50:02,115
Anya! Stop!

654
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,277
Anya, no!

655
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,118
Yes, jump!

656
00:50:07,207 --> 00:50:09,402
The Romanov curse!

657
00:50:09,487 --> 00:50:10,397
Jump!

658
00:50:11,287 --> 00:50:12,515
Jump!

659
00:50:19,727 --> 00:50:20,876
No.

660
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:23,117
Anya! Anya, wake up.

661
00:50:23,207 --> 00:50:25,198
Wake up!

662
00:50:28,127 --> 00:50:31,039
- The Romanov curse.
- What are you talking about?

663
00:50:31,127 --> 00:50:33,880
I keep seeing faces. So many faces.

664
00:50:35,847 --> 00:50:37,838
It was a nightmare.

665
00:50:38,527 --> 00:50:40,757
It's all right now. You're safe now.

666
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:46,641
No!

667
00:50:49,407 --> 00:50:51,204
Easy, master. Wow.

668
00:50:52,607 --> 00:50:54,598
This is no time to lose your head.

669
00:50:54,687 --> 00:50:56,564
You're right.

670
00:50:56,647 --> 00:50:58,638
I am calm.

671
00:50:59,407 --> 00:51:01,398
I am heartless.

672
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:06,082
I have no feelings whatsoever.

673
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:07,122
Sir?

674
00:51:07,207 --> 00:51:10,358
I feel a sudden onset of clarity, Bartok.

675
00:51:11,727 --> 00:51:14,639
I'll have to kill her myself in person.

676
00:51:15,407 --> 00:51:19,036
- What, you mean physically?
- You know what they say.

677
00:51:19,127 --> 00:51:21,402
If you want something done right...

678
00:51:22,887 --> 00:51:25,196
But that means going topside.

679
00:51:25,287 --> 00:51:27,278
Exactly.

680
00:51:27,847 --> 00:51:31,283
I have so many fond memories of Paris.

681
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:37,476
And killing the last of the Romanovs
with my own hands will be so delicious.

682
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,681
- Time to go.
- But you're dead. You're falling apart, sir.

683
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,235
How do you expect to get to Paris
in one piece?

684
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,477
I thought we'd take the train.

685
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:05,319
Ah, yes. I remember so well.

686
00:52:05,407 --> 00:52:08,399
Uncle Yashin was from Moscow.

687
00:52:08,487 --> 00:52:11,160
Uncle Boris was from Odessa.

688
00:52:11,247 --> 00:52:15,365
- And every spring...
- We'd take picnics by the shore on Sunday.

689
00:52:16,287 --> 00:52:18,801
Haven't you anything better to do?

690
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:21,196
Oh, dear. You have to leave now. Yes.

691
00:52:21,287 --> 00:52:23,278
Goodbye.

692
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,002
No more. No more.

693
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:32,646
I must say, I'm so sorry.
I thought that one surely was real.

694
00:52:32,727 --> 00:52:36,720
Well, she was real. I mean, she was
human, of course, but not our real.

695
00:52:36,807 --> 00:52:38,798
But we won't be fooled next time.

696
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:42,118
No, I am going to think
of really hard questions.

697
00:52:43,087 --> 00:52:44,839
No.

698
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,646
My heart can't take it any more.

699
00:52:47,727 --> 00:52:50,764
I will see no more girls
claiming to be Anastasia.

700
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:59,604
- Where is Uncle Boris from?
- What if Sophie doesn't recognise me?

701
00:52:59,687 --> 00:53:02,121
She will. You're Anastasia.

702
00:53:02,207 --> 00:53:05,517
It's just that three days ago
I didn't have any past at all

703
00:53:05,607 --> 00:53:08,519
and now I'm trying to remember
an entire lifetime.

704
00:53:08,607 --> 00:53:12,520
That's why you got me.
Now, where was Uncle Boris from?

705
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:14,518
Moscow?

706
00:53:16,647 --> 00:53:18,478
Oui, monsieur?

707
00:53:20,127 --> 00:53:25,076
Sophie Stanislovskievna Somorkov-Smirnoff!

708
00:53:25,647 --> 00:53:30,482
Vladimir Vanya Voinitsky Vasilovich!

709
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:34,722
Well, this is unexpected.

710
00:53:34,807 --> 00:53:37,719
But look at me. Where are my manners?

711
00:53:38,207 --> 00:53:40,801
Come in, everyone.

712
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:45,526
I am palpitating with amazement
and shock and surprise.

713
00:53:47,487 --> 00:53:53,835
May I present Her lmperial Highness
the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayevna?

714
00:53:53,927 --> 00:53:56,282
Oh, my heavens.

715
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:59,598
She certainly does look like Anastasia.

716
00:54:00,207 --> 00:54:02,562
But so did many of the others.

717
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:06,006
- Where were you born?
- At the Peterhoff Palace.

718
00:54:06,087 --> 00:54:10,717
Correct.
And how does Anastasia like her tea?

719
00:54:11,487 --> 00:54:13,796
I don't like tea. Just hot water and lemon.

720
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:27,560
Finally, you'll most likely find this
an impertinent question,

721
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:29,717
but indulge me.

722
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:35,997
How did you escape
during the siege of the palace?

723
00:54:41,327 --> 00:54:43,318
There was a boy.

724
00:54:43,407 --> 00:54:46,285
A boy who worked in the palace.

725
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:49,285
He opened a wall.

726
00:54:50,807 --> 00:54:52,923
I'm sorry. That's crazy.

727
00:54:53,287 --> 00:54:55,278
Walls opening.

728
00:54:56,687 --> 00:54:58,917
So, is she a Romanov?

729
00:55:00,087 --> 00:55:03,045
Well, she answered every question.

730
00:55:03,127 --> 00:55:05,960
You hear that, child? You did it!

731
00:55:10,247 --> 00:55:14,035
- So, when do we go and see the Empress?
- I'm afraid you don't.

732
00:55:14,127 --> 00:55:15,765
Come again, my pet.

733
00:55:15,847 --> 00:55:18,236
The Empress simply won't allow it.

734
00:55:18,327 --> 00:55:20,443
Now, Sophie, my bright diamond,

735
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:25,806
surely you can think of some way to arrange
a brief interview with the Dowager?

736
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:29,038
I refuse to budge
until an answer occurs to you.

737
00:55:29,127 --> 00:55:30,321
Please.

738
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:36,516
Do you like the Russian Ballet? I believe
they're performing in Paris tonight.

739
00:55:36,607 --> 00:55:40,282
The Dowager Empress and I
love the Russian Ballet.

740
00:55:41,647 --> 00:55:44,081
We never miss it.

741
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:48,918
We did it!

742
00:55:49,007 --> 00:55:52,124
We're going to see
the lmperial Highness tonight.

743
00:55:52,207 --> 00:55:55,040
We're going to get the 10 million roubles.

744
00:55:55,367 --> 00:55:58,245
- We're going to be...
- Vlad. Vlad.

745
00:55:58,607 --> 00:56:02,600
- She is the princess.
- Anya was extraordinary!

746
00:56:02,687 --> 00:56:06,043
I almost believed her. And Sophie...

747
00:56:06,207 --> 00:56:09,358
Sophie wants to take us shopping
for the ballet.

748
00:56:09,447 --> 00:56:11,915
Shopping in Paris. Can you believe it?

749
00:56:19,487 --> 00:56:21,478
Lovers!

750
00:56:22,727 --> 00:56:24,319
Ooh, la-la!

751
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:32,477
Welcome, my friends, to Paree

752
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:37,437
Here, have a flower on me

753
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:41,117
Forget where you're from

754
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:45,122
You're in France - children, come

755
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:50,880
I'll show you that French joie de vivre

756
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:55,245
Paree holds the key to your heart

757
00:56:56,007 --> 00:56:59,079
And all of Paree plays a part

758
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:00,361
Bonjour!

759
00:57:00,447 --> 00:57:04,235
- You'll stroll two-by-two
- Down what we call La Rue

760
00:57:04,327 --> 00:57:08,002
And soon all Paree will be singing to you

761
00:57:08,087 --> 00:57:09,236
Ooh, la-la!

762
00:57:09,327 --> 00:57:12,399
Ooh, la-la! Ooh, la-laaa!

763
00:57:12,487 --> 00:57:15,877
Paree holds the key to I'amour

764
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:19,916
And not even Freud knows the cure

765
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:24,643
- There's love in the air
- At the Folies Bergère

766
00:57:24,727 --> 00:57:27,287
The French have it down to an art

767
00:57:28,287 --> 00:57:32,883
Paree holds the key to your heart

768
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:34,161
Ooh, la-la!

769
00:57:34,247 --> 00:57:38,081
When you're feeling blue, come to Le Moulin

770
00:57:38,527 --> 00:57:42,315
When your heart says "don't"
the French say "do"

771
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:46,965
When you think you can't,
you'll find you cancan

772
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,038
Everyone can cancan

773
00:57:49,127 --> 00:57:51,482
You can cancan, too

774
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:09,320
Paree holds the key to her past

775
00:58:10,727 --> 00:58:14,879
Yes, Princess, I've found you at last

776
00:58:16,087 --> 00:58:18,078
No more pretend

777
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:20,965
You'll be gone, that's the end

778
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:31,205
Paree holds the key to your heart

779
00:58:31,727 --> 00:58:35,640
You'll be très jolie and so smart

780
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:41,043
- Come dance through the night
- And forget all your woes

781
00:58:41,127 --> 00:58:45,643
- The city of light
- Where a rose is a rose

782
00:58:45,727 --> 00:58:50,164
And one never knows what will start

783
00:58:50,247 --> 00:58:55,799
Paree holds the key

784
00:58:55,887 --> 00:58:58,355
To her

785
00:58:58,447 --> 00:59:01,803
Heart

786
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:05,282
Ooh, la-la! Ooh, la-la!

787
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:22,486
We don't have anything to be nervous about.

788
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:25,481
- She's the princess.
- I know. I know. But...

789
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,717
No. No, you don't know.

790
00:59:29,847 --> 00:59:32,600
I was the boy in the palace.

791
00:59:32,687 --> 00:59:36,726
The one who opened the wall.
She's the real thing, Vlad.

792
00:59:39,327 --> 00:59:43,240
That means our Anya has found her family.

793
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:49,522
We have found the heir to the Russian throne.

794
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:54,959
- And you...
- Will walk out of her life for ever.

795
00:59:56,007 --> 00:59:59,636
- But...
- Princesses don't marry kitchen boys.

796
00:59:59,727 --> 01:00:00,955
I know, but...

797
01:00:01,047 --> 01:00:04,596
We're going to go through with this
as if nothing has changed.

798
01:00:04,687 --> 01:00:06,678
You've got to tell her.

799
01:00:07,087 --> 01:00:09,078
Tell me what?

800
01:00:12,807 --> 01:00:15,002
How... how beautiful you look.

801
01:00:16,207 --> 01:00:18,402
Well, thank you.

802
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:29,726
Monsieur.

803
01:00:50,767 --> 01:00:52,758
Look. There she is.

804
01:00:57,447 --> 01:00:59,836
Please, let her remember me.

805
01:01:20,127 --> 01:01:22,118
Everything's gonna be fine.

806
01:01:26,727 --> 01:01:29,366
Come on. I guess it's time.

807
01:01:29,807 --> 01:01:31,798
Relax. You're gonna be great.

808
01:01:33,967 --> 01:01:36,197
Deep breath. Everything's gonna be fine.

809
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:39,882
Wait here forjust a moment.
I'll go in and announce you properly.

810
01:01:40,607 --> 01:01:42,598
- Dimitri...
- Yes?

811
01:01:43,527 --> 01:01:45,722
Look, we've been through a lot together.

812
01:01:47,687 --> 01:01:50,326
- And I just wanted to...
- Yes?

813
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:52,758
Well...

814
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:55,118
Thank you, I guess.

815
01:01:55,207 --> 01:01:57,846
Yes. Thank you, for everything.

816
01:01:59,047 --> 01:02:01,607
- Anya, I...
- Yes?

817
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:05,361
- I'm... I...
- Yes?

818
01:02:07,967 --> 01:02:10,162
I want to wish you good luck, I guess.

819
01:02:13,687 --> 01:02:15,678
Good luck.

820
01:02:15,767 --> 01:02:17,758
Well, here goes.

821
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:24,478
Please inform Her Majesty,
the Dowager Empress,

822
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:28,196
that I have found her granddaughter,
the Grand Duchess Anastasia.

823
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:30,437
She's waiting to see herjust outside.

824
01:02:30,527 --> 01:02:36,841
I'm very sorry, young man, but
the Dowager Empress, she will see no one.

825
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:42,399
Tell that impertinent young man that I have
seen enough Grand Duchess Anastasias

826
01:02:42,487 --> 01:02:44,603
to last me a lifetime.

827
01:02:44,687 --> 01:02:46,917
- You'd better go.
- Please, let me just...

828
01:02:47,007 --> 01:02:53,480
Now, if you'll excuse me, I wish to live out
the remainder of my lonely life in peace.

829
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:56,798
I'll see you to the door.

830
01:02:57,247 --> 01:02:59,317
Come, come now. Come to the door.

831
01:03:02,447 --> 01:03:04,597
Your Majesty, I intend you no harm.

832
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:08,681
My name is Dimitri.
I used to work at the palace.

833
01:03:08,767 --> 01:03:11,565
Well, that's one I haven't heard, I must say.

834
01:03:13,287 --> 01:03:16,120
Wait. Don't go. Please.
If you'll just hear me out...

835
01:03:16,207 --> 01:03:19,722
I know what you're after. I've seen it before.

836
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,719
Men who train young women
in the royal ways.

837
01:03:22,807 --> 01:03:27,483
- But if Your Highness will just listen...
- Haven't you been listening? Enough.

838
01:03:27,567 --> 01:03:31,242
I don't care how much you have fashioned
this girl to look like her,

839
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,318
sound like her or act like her.

840
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:35,398
In the end, it never is her.

841
01:03:35,487 --> 01:03:39,275
- This time it is her.
- Dimitri. I've heard of you.

842
01:03:39,847 --> 01:03:41,997
You're that con man from St Petersburg

843
01:03:42,087 --> 01:03:46,558
who was holding auditions
to find an Anastasia lookalike.

844
01:03:46,647 --> 01:03:48,717
But we've come all the way from Russia...

845
01:03:48,807 --> 01:03:51,401
And others have come from Timbuktu.

846
01:03:51,687 --> 01:03:53,723
No. It's not what you think.

847
01:03:53,807 --> 01:03:59,200
How much pain will you inflict on an
old woman for money? Remove him at once.

848
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:04,486
But she is Anastasia. I'm telling you.
If you'll only speak to her, you'll see.

849
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:10,802
- It was all a lie, wasn't it?
- No. No.

850
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:13,163
You used me?

851
01:04:13,247 --> 01:04:15,966
I was just part of your con to get her money?

852
01:04:16,047 --> 01:04:20,723
No. No, no, no. It started out that way,
but everything's different now,

853
01:04:20,807 --> 01:04:22,957
because you really are Anastasia.

854
01:04:23,047 --> 01:04:24,765
- You are.
- Stop it!

855
01:04:24,847 --> 01:04:27,725
From the very beginning, you lied!

856
01:04:27,807 --> 01:04:30,799
And I not only believed you, I actually...

857
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,765
Anya, please. When you spoke of
the door of the wall opening and the boy...

858
01:04:35,847 --> 01:04:37,644
- Listen to me. That was...
- No!

859
01:04:37,727 --> 01:04:42,676
I don't want to hear about anything that I said
or remembered. You just leave me alone!

860
01:04:43,927 --> 01:04:46,043
Anya, please. You have to know the truth!

861
01:04:56,607 --> 01:04:58,598
Your Majesty.

862
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:10,805
Ilya, slow down.

863
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:13,481
I'm not llya. And I won't slow down.

864
01:05:13,567 --> 01:05:15,876
- Not until you listen.
- You!

865
01:05:15,967 --> 01:05:19,084
How dare you? Stop this car immediately.

866
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:20,885
Stop this car!

867
01:05:34,447 --> 01:05:36,642
You have to talk to her.

868
01:05:37,287 --> 01:05:39,517
Just look at her. Please.

869
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:42,326
I won't be badgered by you a moment longer.

870
01:05:42,927 --> 01:05:44,918
Do you recognise this?

871
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:50,358
Where did you get this?

872
01:05:50,727 --> 01:05:56,324
I know you've been hurt, but it's just possible
she's been as lost and alone as you.

873
01:05:57,647 --> 01:06:00,400
You'll stop at nothing, will you?

874
01:06:01,247 --> 01:06:04,637
I'm probably about as stubborn as you are.

875
01:06:11,967 --> 01:06:13,958
Go away, Dimitri.

876
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:26,756
I'm sorry, I thought you were...

877
01:06:26,847 --> 01:06:30,840
I know very well who you thought I was.
Who exactly are you?

878
01:06:32,567 --> 01:06:34,558
I was hoping you could tell me.

879
01:06:34,887 --> 01:06:37,037
My dear, I'm old.

880
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:40,324
And I'm tired of being conned and tricked.

881
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:43,322
I don't want to trick you.

882
01:06:43,407 --> 01:06:47,286
And I suppose the money
doesn't interest you, either?

883
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:50,958
I just want to know who I am.

884
01:06:51,567 --> 01:06:54,639
Whether or not I belong to a family.

885
01:06:54,727 --> 01:06:56,718
Your family.

886
01:07:00,607 --> 01:07:03,565
You're a very good actress.
The best yet, in fact.

887
01:07:03,647 --> 01:07:05,922
But I've had enough.

888
01:07:10,007 --> 01:07:12,760
- Peppermint?
- An oil for my hands.

889
01:07:13,407 --> 01:07:15,398
Yes.

890
01:07:15,487 --> 01:07:17,478
And I spilled a bottle.

891
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:22,638
The carpet was soaked
and it forever smelled of peppermint.

892
01:07:23,367 --> 01:07:25,198
Like you.

893
01:07:27,247 --> 01:07:31,240
I used to lie there on that rug and
how I missed you when you went away.

894
01:07:32,447 --> 01:07:35,484
When you came here, to Paris.

895
01:07:41,287 --> 01:07:43,278
What is that?

896
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:47,918
This? Well, I've always had it,
ever since before I can remember.

897
01:07:48,367 --> 01:07:50,358
May I?

898
01:07:54,727 --> 01:07:56,718
It was our secret.

899
01:07:57,727 --> 01:08:00,241
My Anastasia's and mine.

900
01:08:05,927 --> 01:08:07,918
The music box.

901
01:08:09,487 --> 01:08:12,797
To sing me to sleep when you were in Paris.

902
01:08:23,647 --> 01:08:28,596
Hear this song and remember

903
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:32,207
Soon you'll be

904
01:08:32,927 --> 01:08:35,487
Home with me

905
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:41,678
Once upon a December

906
01:08:43,407 --> 01:08:45,398
Oh, Anastasia!

907
01:08:46,487 --> 01:08:48,478
My Anastasia.

908
01:09:06,607 --> 01:09:09,167
Bartok, get me a comb.

909
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:12,398
Find some cologne. I want to look my best.

910
01:09:12,487 --> 01:09:17,356
- That might take some work, sir.
- Then snap to it. We're going to a party.

911
01:09:17,447 --> 01:09:19,881
- A party in Paris?
- That's right.

912
01:09:19,967 --> 01:09:23,642
I could teach you the latest dance step.
It starts with a...

913
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:27,720
And then you get really crazy
with the hips, sir. It's fun.

914
01:09:27,807 --> 01:09:31,322
We'll let the Grand Duchess Anastasia
have her moment.

915
01:09:31,407 --> 01:09:34,843
- Who cares?
- And then we'll kill her.

916
01:09:34,927 --> 01:09:39,239
Right, and then... kill her?
Sir, what happened to the party idea?

917
01:09:39,327 --> 01:09:43,923
That's where we'll kill her.
Crush her at the height of her glory.

918
01:09:44,607 --> 01:09:46,598
And we're back with the crushing.

919
01:09:47,007 --> 01:09:53,003
Sir, I'm begging you. Please.
Please, forget the girl and get a life.

920
01:09:53,087 --> 01:09:56,124
Oh, I'll get a life, Bartok.

921
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:59,318
Hers!

922
01:10:10,527 --> 01:10:13,724
I remember now how much I loved them.

923
01:10:13,807 --> 01:10:19,564
They would not want us to live in the past,
not now that we have found each other.

924
01:10:21,647 --> 01:10:25,117
Look here. The drawing you gave me.

925
01:10:26,007 --> 01:10:27,998
Remember?

926
01:10:28,247 --> 01:10:30,966
Yes. Olga made me so mad.

927
01:10:31,047 --> 01:10:34,244
She said it looked like a pig riding a donkey.

928
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:36,477
- She was right.
- In your laughter,

929
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:41,482
once again I hear my Nicky, your dear father.

930
01:10:46,727 --> 01:10:51,437
But you have the beauty of your mother,
Alexandra,

931
01:10:52,007 --> 01:10:54,237
Empress of all Russia.

932
01:11:21,207 --> 01:11:23,243
You sent for me, Your Grace?

933
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:27,684
10 million roubles, as promised,
with my gratitude.

934
01:11:28,407 --> 01:11:32,844
I accept your gratitude, Your Highness.
But I don't want the money.

935
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:35,043
What do you want, then?

936
01:11:36,047 --> 01:11:38,515
Unfortunately, nothing you can give.

937
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:45,526
Young man,
where did you get that music box?

938
01:11:47,327 --> 01:11:51,286
You were the boy, weren't you?
The servant boy who got us out.

939
01:11:52,367 --> 01:11:56,838
You saved her life, and mine,
then you restored her to me.

940
01:11:57,887 --> 01:12:00,560
Yet you want no reward?

941
01:12:00,647 --> 01:12:02,046
Not any more.

942
01:12:02,127 --> 01:12:04,595
Why the change of mind?

943
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:07,155
It was more a change of heart.

944
01:12:08,527 --> 01:12:10,518
I must go.

945
01:12:26,847 --> 01:12:28,838
Hello, Dimitri.

946
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:31,761
- Hello.
- Did you collect your reward?

947
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,838
My business is complete.

948
01:12:33,927 --> 01:12:38,796
Young man, you will bow and address
the Princess as "Your Highness".

949
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:41,082
- No, that's not necessary.
- Please...

950
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:44,477
Your Highness. I'm glad you found
what you were looking for.

951
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:47,357
Yes, I'm glad you did, too.

952
01:12:48,367 --> 01:12:51,677
Well, then. Goodbye, Your Highness.

953
01:12:59,727 --> 01:13:01,718
Goodbye.

954
01:13:10,167 --> 01:13:12,681
You look fabulous!

955
01:13:15,727 --> 01:13:18,719
Do you mind? No, of course not.
You're a wonderful dog.

956
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:26,361
Well, if you're ever in St Petersburg again,
look me up.

957
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,798
So long, Vlad.

958
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:33,517
Ah, my boy...

959
01:13:34,967 --> 01:13:37,765
- You're making a mistake.
- Trust me,

960
01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:40,964
this is the one thing I'm doing right.

961
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,320
So long, mutt.

962
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:51,121
I can't stay. I don't belong here.

963
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:06,762
- He's not there.
- Oh, I know he's not here.

964
01:14:06,847 --> 01:14:10,396
- Who's not there, Grandmamma?
- A remarkable young man

965
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:12,682
who found a music box.

966
01:14:12,767 --> 01:14:17,158
Well, he's probably too busy spending
his reward money as fast as he can.

967
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:20,525
Look at them dance.

968
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:26,238
You were born into this world
of glittering jewels and fine titles.

969
01:14:26,327 --> 01:14:31,355
But I wonder if this is what you really want.

970
01:14:31,447 --> 01:14:35,520
Of course. Of course it is.
I found what I was looking for.

971
01:14:35,607 --> 01:14:37,598
I found out who I am.

972
01:14:38,327 --> 01:14:40,318
I found you.

973
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:43,158
Yes, you did find me.

974
01:14:43,247 --> 01:14:45,522
And you'll always have me.

975
01:14:46,487 --> 01:14:48,478
But is it enough?

976
01:14:50,447 --> 01:14:52,438
My darling...

977
01:14:54,607 --> 01:14:58,156
- He didn't take the money.
- He didn't?

978
01:14:58,247 --> 01:15:03,196
Knowing that you are alive,
seeing the woman you have become,

979
01:15:03,287 --> 01:15:06,802
brings me joy I never thought
I could feel again.

980
01:15:13,447 --> 01:15:15,642
Whatever you choose,

981
01:15:16,327 --> 01:15:18,602
we will always have each other.

982
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,836
Grandmamma, can't you tell me the...

983
01:15:40,847 --> 01:15:42,758
Pooka?

984
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:49,838
Pooka?

985
01:15:55,087 --> 01:15:57,078
Pooka.

986
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:10,040
- Voilà.
- You're next.

987
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,397
Pooka? Here boy.

988
01:16:31,127 --> 01:16:32,401
There you are.

989
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:34,876
Anastasia...

990
01:16:38,567 --> 01:16:40,922
Anastasia...

991
01:16:48,847 --> 01:16:50,838
Anastasia.

992
01:16:52,247 --> 01:16:55,239
Your lmperial Highness.

993
01:16:55,927 --> 01:16:59,602
Look what ten years has done to us.

994
01:17:00,247 --> 01:17:02,920
You, a beautiful young flower.

995
01:17:03,567 --> 01:17:05,558
And me...

996
01:17:05,647 --> 01:17:09,083
- A rotting corpse.
- That face.

997
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:13,080
Last seen at a party like this one.

998
01:17:13,167 --> 01:17:18,082
- A curse.
- Followed by a tragic night on the ice.

999
01:17:18,407 --> 01:17:19,806
Remember?

1000
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:29,718
- Rasputin?
- Rasputin.

1001
01:17:31,287 --> 01:17:35,360
Destroyed by your despicable family!

1002
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:38,917
But what goes around comes around

1003
01:17:39,007 --> 01:17:42,443
- and around and around and around...
- Stop! No!

1004
01:17:44,487 --> 01:17:48,878
You're on your own, sir.
This can only end in tears.

1005
01:17:51,927 --> 01:17:55,317
- I'm not afraid of you.
- I can fix that!

1006
01:17:56,167 --> 01:17:59,557
Care for a little swim under the ice?

1007
01:18:01,007 --> 01:18:04,124
Say your prayers, Anastasia!

1008
01:18:05,127 --> 01:18:08,517
- No one can save you!
- Wanna bet?

1009
01:18:15,167 --> 01:18:16,236
Dimitri...

1010
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:21,518
- If we survive, remind me to thank you.
- Thank me later.

1011
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:23,359
How enchanting.

1012
01:18:23,447 --> 01:18:26,484
Together again - for the last time!

1013
01:18:27,807 --> 01:18:29,365
You'll get a kick out of this.

1014
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:36,526
No!

1015
01:18:44,367 --> 01:18:45,436
Dimitri!

1016
01:18:46,447 --> 01:18:48,005
Watch out!

1017
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:52,646
Do svidaniya, Your Highness.

1018
01:18:56,687 --> 01:18:58,325
Hold on!

1019
01:18:58,407 --> 01:19:01,877
Finally, the last Romanov death.

1020
01:19:11,687 --> 01:19:12,597
No!

1021
01:19:12,687 --> 01:19:14,757
Anya!

1022
01:19:15,767 --> 01:19:18,918
Long live the Romanovs!

1023
01:19:19,687 --> 01:19:21,200
Right.

1024
01:19:22,767 --> 01:19:25,042
I couldn't have said it better myself.

1025
01:19:50,047 --> 01:19:52,242
This is for Dimitri.

1026
01:19:53,567 --> 01:19:56,206
- Give it back.
- This is for my family.

1027
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:02,120
- I'll tear you to pieces.
- And this is for you.

1028
01:20:02,807 --> 01:20:04,684
Do svidaniya.

1029
01:20:42,727 --> 01:20:43,716
Dimitri?

1030
01:20:57,287 --> 01:21:00,518
- Dimitri!
- No, no. Let go. Let go.

1031
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:03,280
- Sorry.
- Yeah. I know. I know.

1032
01:21:03,367 --> 01:21:05,358
All men are babies.

1033
01:21:08,047 --> 01:21:10,686
- I thought you were going to St Peters...
- I was.

1034
01:21:10,767 --> 01:21:12,803
- You didn't take the...
- I couldn't.

1035
01:21:14,447 --> 01:21:16,836
- Why?
- Because...

1036
01:21:17,287 --> 01:21:19,278
I...

1037
01:21:31,247 --> 01:21:33,238
They're waiting for you.

1038
01:21:49,007 --> 01:21:51,919
Dear Grandmamma, wish me luck.

1039
01:21:52,687 --> 01:21:55,201
We'll be together in Paris again soon.

1040
01:21:56,127 --> 01:21:58,118
A bientôt.

1041
01:21:59,807 --> 01:22:01,798
They've eloped.

1042
01:22:01,887 --> 01:22:03,878
Isn't it romantic?

1043
01:22:05,327 --> 01:22:07,557
