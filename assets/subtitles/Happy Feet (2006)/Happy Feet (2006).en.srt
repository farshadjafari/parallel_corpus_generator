1
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:48,916
<i>Once there was a way</i>
<i>To get back homeward</i>

2
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:53,078
<i>Are the stars out tonight?</i>

3
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:58,523
<i>Once there was a way to get back home</i>

4
00:00:58,695 --> 00:01:00,959
<i>I only have eyes</i>

5
00:01:01,137 --> 00:01:06,159
<i>Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry</i>

6
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:08,668
<i>For you</i>

7
00:01:08,838 --> 00:01:11,432
<i>And I will sing a lullaby</i>

8
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:14,543
<i>With a song in my heart</i>

9
00:01:15,044 --> 00:01:17,103
<i>So tell me</i>

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,579
<i>Tell me something good</i>

11
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:25,752
<i>Tell me that you love me</i>

12
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:28,550
<i>Tell me, baby</i>

13
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:31,125
<i>Tell me something good</i>

14
00:01:31,294 --> 00:01:33,023
<i>Only you</i>

15
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:35,096
<i>But how can you know for sure?</i>

16
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:38,200
<i>Can make this world seem right</i>

17
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:39,926
<i>Is there really just one?</i>

18
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:42,731
<i>I need your love</i>

19
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:47,509
<i>So many songs, but I'm feeling so lonely.</i>

20
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:51,477
<i>Where is the love?</i>

21
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:59,990
<i>You don't have to be beautiful</i>

22
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:03,092
<i>To turn me on</i>

23
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:07,328
<i>I just need your body, baby</i>

24
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:08,726
<i>Hello</i>

25
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:12,164
<i>- From dusk till dawn</i>
<i>- Is it me you're looking for?</i>

26
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:15,430
<i>You don't need experience</i>

27
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:16,698
<i>Take</i>

28
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:20,366
<i>- To turn me out</i>
<i>- These broken wings</i>

29
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,638
<i>You just leave it all up to me</i>

30
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:28,751
<i>Let's talk about eggs, baby</i>
<i>Let's talk about you and me</i>

31
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,546
<i>You don't have to be rich</i>

32
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:32,985
<i>- Give me all your loving</i>
<i>- To be my pearl</i>

33
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:37,093
<i>You don't have to be cool</i>
<i>To rule my world</i>

34
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:41,357
<i>Ain't no particular song</i>
<i>I'm more compatible with</i>

35
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,966
<i>I just want your extra...</i>

36
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:46,864
Boys. Boys.

37
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:48,868
Give a chick a chance.

38
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,476
<i>Well, since my baby left me</i>

39
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:57,045
<i>I found a new place to dwell</i>

40
00:02:57,214 --> 00:03:01,708
<i>It's down at the end of Lonely Street</i>
<i>At Heartbreak Hotel</i>

41
00:03:01,886 --> 00:03:05,322
<i>And I said, "I'm feelin' so lonely, baby</i>

42
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,049
<i>I'm feelin' so lonely</i>

43
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:10,523
<i>Oh, I'm feelin' so lonely"...</i>

44
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:13,686
<i>I could die</i>

45
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,569
<i>Don't have to be rich to be my girl</i>

46
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:25,732
<i>Don't have to be cool to rule my world</i>

47
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,400
<i>You rule my world</i>

48
00:03:27,578 --> 00:03:32,277
<i>You're the particular song</i>
<i>I'm compatible with</i>

49
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:34,280
<i>I just want your</i>

50
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:37,978
<i>- Extra time</i>
<i>- Extra time</i>

51
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:44,253
<i>- And your kiss</i>
<i>- And your kiss</i>

52
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:47,761
<i>His mom and dad met in the usual way.</i>

53
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:50,662
<i>The song became love...</i>

54
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:54,271
<i>... and love became the egg.</i>

55
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,604
Memphis?

56
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:03,111
- You got it, sugar?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

57
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:04,873
Safe and warm.

58
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,540
Hold it tight, now.

59
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:09,152
Whoa, I think I felt a move in there.

60
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:11,414
<i>And in the usual way...</i>

61
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,252
<i>... the moms left for the fishing season...</i>

62
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:18,658
<i>... while the dads stayed home</i>
<i>to do egg time.</i>

63
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,092
You gonna be okay, Daddy?

64
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:23,792
Oh, sure, honey. We'll be waiting for you,
right here on Lonely Street.

65
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:28,838
<i>I love you more and more, tell me why</i>

66
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,304
Bye-bye, now.

67
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:33,774
Goodbye, Norma Jean.
Don't you worry about a thing.

68
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:36,778
<i>Don't wanna let you go</i>

69
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:41,311
<i>I never can say goodbye, boy</i>

70
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:47,454
When all others leave...

71
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:49,693
...we remain!

72
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:52,557
When the sun vanishes...

73
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:55,656
...we remain!

74
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:59,326
<i>I'm feelin' so lonely</i>
<i>I'm feelin' so lonely...</i>

75
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:04,498
Heed the wisdoms, brothers!
Make a huddle!

76
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:07,509
Warm thy egg!

77
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,237
Make a huddle!

78
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:12,609
- Share the cold!
- Share the cold.

79
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:16,550
Each must take his turn
against the icy blast...

80
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,747
...if we are to survive the endless night.

81
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:24,521
<i>Raise your voices, brothers!</i>

82
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:27,358
<i>Give praise to the Great 'Guin...</i>

83
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:33,164
<i>... who puts songs in our hearts</i>
<i>and fish in our bellies!</i>

84
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:43,004
<i>Ain't no particular song</i>
<i>I'm more compatible with</i>

85
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:46,581
Oh, baby, I think I wanna dance now.

86
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,944
No, no, no.

87
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:55,155
<i>There is a wisdom,</i>
<i>brothers and sisters...</i>

88
00:05:55,326 --> 00:05:58,693
<i>... that stands above all others.</i>

89
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,027
<i>- Never, ever...</i>
- It's okay.

90
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:04,066
<i>...no matter what...</i>
- No harm done. See?

91
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:06,136
<i>... drop your egg.</i>

92
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:09,331
No, we're cool. We're cool.

93
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:23,288
<i>Of the many thousands who sang</i>
<i>through that long night of winter...</i>

94
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:27,654
<i>... it was Memphis</i>
<i>who cried out most fervently...</i>

95
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:32,958
<i>... to turn the Earth</i>
<i>and bring back the sun.</i>

96
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:13,268
- It's a boy!
- Hey, it's a girl!

97
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,464
- What a peach!
- What a bruiser!

98
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:17,802
- Come here, son.
- Come to Daddy, there you go.

99
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:19,877
Son, you have made
your daddy so proud.

100
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:21,876
It's all genetics, you know.

101
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:33,719
Memphis?

102
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:36,657
Is everything okay?

103
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,328
I don't know. I can't hear anything.

104
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:47,532
- Is it empty?
- Honey.

105
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:48,798
- Can I have it?
- Gloria.

106
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:51,135
It's okay, Maurice.

107
00:07:57,883 --> 00:08:00,545
It happens sometimes, Memphis.

108
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:02,245
Yeah.

109
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,952
Wait, you hear that?

110
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:12,856
- Yeah.
- Hey, I can hear you, buddy.

111
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:16,027
Oh, your papa's here, it's okay.

112
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:21,136
Oh, he's okay, Maurice.
Whoa, there it is!

113
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:23,538
That's his little foot there.

114
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:26,008
There's his other one.

115
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:29,780
That's different.

116
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,850
Hey! Come back here, Mr. Mumble.

117
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:33,007
Gloria...

118
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:35,245
She can call him
whatever the heck she likes.

119
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:37,253
Whoa, little Mumble.

120
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:44,525
- Mumble? Mumble?
- You okay?

121
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:48,461
Freezing. Freezing.

122
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:49,932
Oh, you'll get used to it.

123
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:53,304
Come on. Come to your daddy.

124
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,234
- What do you make of that?
- Little wobbly in the knees.

125
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,605
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

126
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:01,076
What you doing there, boy?

127
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:02,545
I'm happy, Pa.

128
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:04,748
What you doing with your feet?

129
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:07,876
They're happy too.

130
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:10,579
- I wouldn't do that around folks, son.
- Why not?

131
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:13,624
- Well, it just ain't penguin, okay?
- Okay.

132
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:17,160
Yeah. Hey, come on over here.
Get under here. Get warm.

133
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,594
Watch the beak. Watch the beak... Beak!

134
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:21,199
The beak.

135
00:09:21,368 --> 00:09:24,098
Okay, good boy.

136
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,274
So late. What's keeping them?

137
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:36,245
Pray, brothers, the Great 'Guin
does not test us with a lean season.

138
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:40,011
Why, Noah? Have we not all been dutiful?

139
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:42,418
So when you see your mama...

140
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:44,716
- I stand perfectly still.
- You got it.

141
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:47,621
But how will I know
which one's my mama?

142
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:48,886
Oh, you'll know.

143
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:51,860
She's got a wiggle in her walk
and a giggle in her talk.

144
00:09:52,232 --> 00:09:55,668
And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.

145
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:04,170
Hey, wait. I see them. I see them!

146
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:05,572
You're right! You're right!

147
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:07,975
Wives, ho!

148
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,039
Wives, ho!

149
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:12,110
Wives, ho!

150
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:16,014
Wait, no. Wait, no, Mumble, get back here.
No, Mumble! Get back... Mumble!

151
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,455
Mumble! Mumble!

152
00:10:20,094 --> 00:10:22,358
Mumble!

153
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:25,990
Michelle? Michelle?

154
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,601
- Roxanne?
- Michelle?

155
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:32,535
Alfie?

156
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:36,869
- Maurice!
- Michelle! Michelle!

157
00:10:37,044 --> 00:10:38,204
Mommy!

158
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:39,971
Oh, she's so darling.

159
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:44,811
Excuse me. Pardon me, pardon me.
Mumble? Mumble?

160
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:46,010
Oh, Mumble.

161
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,519
- Mama?
- Mumble!

162
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,850
- Mama?
- Mumble!

163
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,390
Mumble!

164
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,822
Mama? Mama?

165
00:10:53,995 --> 00:10:57,055
- Mumble, boy, where are you?
- Mama!

166
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:04,768
Memphis?

167
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,836
Oh, Mama. Oh, Mama.

168
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,703
- Oh, my.
- Daddy.

169
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,842
So where's the baby?

170
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:16,313
Well, honey, I'll find him.

171
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:18,577
- You lost the baby? Memphis!
- It's okay.

172
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:20,618
- Mama? Mama?
- Stay!

173
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:24,688
- Come to Mommy.
- No, Mumble.

174
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:26,952
Mama, Mama.

175
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:29,326
Hey, what's wrong with his feet?

176
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:33,228
Oh, that's just a little thing he's got going.
He'll grow out of it.

177
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,301
Mama!

178
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,098
Oh, Memphis, he's gorgeous.

179
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:41,969
- Isn't he, though?
- Look at you.

180
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:44,134
I got something for you.

181
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:46,040
Open up.

182
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,246
Oh, I love the way she does that.

183
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,690
<i>W, X, Y and Z</i>

184
00:11:57,858 --> 00:11:59,052
Good morning, class.

185
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:01,592
Good morning, Miss Viola.

186
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,751
Right.

187
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,331
Well, today we begin with the most
important lesson you will ever learn...

188
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,797
...at Penguin Elementary.

189
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:09,629
Does anyone know what that is?

190
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:11,066
Anyone? Anyone?

191
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:12,227
Someone? Seymour?

192
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:14,306
- Fishing?
- No.

193
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:15,840
Mumble?

194
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,602
Don't eat yellow snow?

195
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,177
No, that's not it, no.

196
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:22,509
- It's our Heartsong, Miss.
- Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, yes.

197
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:25,551
Without our Heartsong,
we can't be truly penguin, can we?

198
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,517
No.

199
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:31,056
But, my dears, it's not something
that I can actually teach you.

200
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:33,626
Does anybody know why?
Anyone? Anyone?

201
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,456
You can't teach it to us, ma'am...

202
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,259
...because we have to find
our Heartsongs all by ourselves.

203
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:40,423
Well done, you.

204
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:42,263
It's the voice you hear inside...

205
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:44,029
...who you truly are.

206
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:46,731
Yes. Thank you, Gloria.
Excellent, lovely, thank you.

207
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:49,274
So let's all be very still now.

208
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:52,709
Take a moment and let it come to you.

209
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:53,973
- I got one!
- Pick me!

210
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,084
- Pick me! Pick me!
- One at a time. Yes, Seymour.

211
00:12:57,252 --> 00:13:01,382
<i>Don't push me</i>
<i>'Cause I am close to the edge</i>

212
00:13:01,556 --> 00:13:04,491
<i>I'm trying not to lose my head</i>

213
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,628
Yes, I like that one. I could
really get jiggy with that. Lovely.

214
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:09,388
I'm ready. I got one.

215
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:12,124
Oh, I thought you might, Gloria.

216
00:13:14,703 --> 00:13:18,002
<i>Midnight creeps so slowly</i>

217
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,607
<i>Into hearts of those</i>

218
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:23,369
<i>Who need more than they get</i>

219
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:26,446
<i>Daylight deals a bad hand</i>

220
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:28,640
<i>To a penguin</i>

221
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:35,245
<i>Who has laid too many bets</i>

222
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,217
That's as far as I got so far.

223
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:39,986
- Oh, yes, lovely. Really lovely.
- That's beautiful.

224
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:43,427
Well, Mumble, since
you seem so keen to share.

225
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:48,168
Mine's sort of a boom and a:

226
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,169
And another boom.

227
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,466
You heard that in there?

228
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:55,906
- Do you like it?
- I'm afraid that's not a tune.

229
00:13:56,378 --> 00:14:00,337
- It's not?
- No, dear. A tune is like:

230
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:05,812
Oh, okay.

231
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:11,854
Who is that?

232
00:14:12,027 --> 00:14:14,860
That is the offspring of Memphis
and Norma Jean.

233
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,588
The wee hippity-hopper.

234
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:24,995
It's not funny!

235
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:27,198
No. No, not in the least.

236
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,834
A penguin without a Heartsong
is hardly a penguin at all.

237
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:33,447
I think he broke my ear.

238
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:36,313
In all my years, I've never, I mean...

239
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:40,080
And you having such fine voices.
Well, it's bizarre.

240
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:43,783
Did anything happen, you know,
during early development?

241
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,394
No, all fine. Normal incubation.

242
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:47,893
- Right.
- Wasn't it, honey?

243
00:14:48,064 --> 00:14:51,659
Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough winter,
I guess.

244
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:52,823
Right, right.

245
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:55,470
- He did hatch a little late...
- Yes, I understand. Yes.

246
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:58,698
- To think he might spend his life alone...
- Quite, quite.

247
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:01,035
...never to meet his one true love.

248
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,407
Oh, please, Miss Viola,
isn't there something we can do?

249
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:08,039
Well, there is always Mrs. Astrakhan.

250
00:15:08,217 --> 00:15:09,206
Mrs. Astrakhan?

251
00:15:09,385 --> 00:15:12,149
If anyone can, Mrs. Astrakhan can.

252
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:17,753
Can't sing?

253
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:20,191
Can't sing? Rubbish, darling.

254
00:15:20,363 --> 00:15:22,991
Every little penguin has a song.

255
00:15:23,165 --> 00:15:24,792
When I have finished...

256
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:28,630
...your singing will be giving everyone
the goose pimple.

257
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:32,706
Now, to begin.
First, we must find a feeling.

258
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,003
Happy feeling, sad feeling.

259
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:39,511
Maybe lonely feeling.

260
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:41,881
You feel it?

261
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:45,077
Good. Now, let it out.

262
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:47,950
Be spontaneous.

263
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:53,191
That, what is that?

264
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:55,557
I'm being spontan-you-us.

265
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,832
Darling, you want to meet beautiful girl?

266
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,367
You want to make the egg?

267
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:02,629
Oh, yes.

268
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:08,209
Well, sing! And no jiggy-jog.
Do not move muscle.

269
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:10,504
No moving!

270
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,716
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</i>

271
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:16,476
Enough!

272
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:19,849
Okay. We go back to the top.

273
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:23,950
Forget body. Look inside soul.

274
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:27,823
Feel the feeling. Enormous feeling.

275
00:16:27,997 --> 00:16:31,364
So enormous it fills whole body.

276
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,799
It must escape or you explode.

277
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,804
- Now, open your little beak.
- Come on.

278
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:41,102
Yes, yes. Lift up the head, that's it.

279
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:43,576
Now... Now...

280
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:48,446
<i>Now</i>

281
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:19,713
Disaster! Catastrophe!

282
00:17:19,883 --> 00:17:22,147
I never fail before.

283
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,447
Never! Never!

284
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:37,496
- Well, I thought it was kind of cute.
- But it just ain't penguin, okay?

285
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:40,932
So what if he's a little different?
I always kind of liked different.

286
00:17:41,104 --> 00:17:43,766
He's not different.
He's a regular emperor penguin.

287
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,965
Hey, you know what? I can leave school.

288
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:48,338
I can go to work. The three of us.

289
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:52,346
Whoa, little fella. You ain't going nowhere
till you got yourself an education.

290
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:55,451
You get them singing muscles
big and strong, you got that?

291
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:56,745
I'll try, Pa.

292
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,412
You bet you will. The word "triumph"
starts with "try," and it ends with...?

293
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,253
- "Umph."
- That's right. A great big "umph."

294
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:06,586
I'm going fishing.

295
00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:14,731
Oh, Mumble.

296
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:20,909
<i>That first hard summer...</i>

297
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:24,103
<i>... while his mom and dad</i>
<i>were working overtime...</i>

298
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:27,182
<i>... on the great commute to the sea...</i>

299
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,684
<i>... Mumble found a place</i>
<i>away from disapproving eyes...</i>

300
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:37,316
<i>... where a funky little fella</i>
<i>could be himself.</i>

301
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:34,417
Hey, what you doing there, flipper bird?

302
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:36,815
Nothing. What are you doing?

303
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:39,821
Nothing. Just dropped in
for a little lunch.

304
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:42,721
There's food? Here?

305
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:44,819
Leg or wing?

306
00:19:44,996 --> 00:19:47,430
Oh, no, no, wait. Not me, I'm a penguin.

307
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:51,295
Exactly. The flipper birds,
that's you, eat the fish.

308
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:54,996
The flying birds, that's me,
eat the flipper bird and the fish.

309
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:57,402
And lately, there ain't a lot of fish.

310
00:19:57,575 --> 00:19:59,668
- So...
- This time I'm getting the juicy bits.

311
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:02,244
- Me first!
- Hey, you want a piece of me?

312
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:05,075
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm trying to think about lunch.

313
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:08,446
Wait! Watch this!

314
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:18,821
Yeah, that's weird, all right. Listen.
For once, we're gonna do this civilized.

315
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:21,590
- Now, get in line...
- Hey! What's that on your leg?

316
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:24,894
- What? This little thing?
- Oh, no. Don't start him on that.

317
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:28,197
Shut up! The little flipper bird
asked me a perceptive question.

318
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:31,068
- A question like that deserves an answer.
- Here we go.

319
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:32,903
I got two words for you:

320
00:20:33,578 --> 00:20:36,138
"Alien abduction."

321
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:38,009
- Oh, you had to ask.
- Have mercy.

322
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:40,047
Quiet!

323
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:43,618
Now, little buddy,
there is something out there.

324
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:45,881
Creatures. Not like us.

325
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:48,287
Bigger, fiercer, and smarter too.

326
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:49,949
- Ask me how I know.
- How?

327
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:52,289
Because I've been captured by them,
that's how.

328
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:53,488
Unbelievable.

329
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:55,633
What do you mean "unbelievable?"
It's true.

330
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:58,031
I'm sitting on a rock,
minding my own business...

331
00:20:58,203 --> 00:20:59,795
...when suddenly, they're onto me.

332
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:02,099
These beings, like big ugly penguins.

333
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,401
Fat, flabby faces with front-ways eyes...

334
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:07,977
...no feathers, no beaks,
and these... These appendages.

335
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:10,838
They probe me. They tie me up.
They strap me down.

336
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:13,883
They take this pointy thing
and they stick it into me.

337
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:16,612
And then, blackout.

338
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:18,187
Gosh.

339
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:21,292
I woke up and there's this...
This thing on me.

340
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,692
Every flying bird is dissing me,
"Hey, what's happening, yellow leg?"

341
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:27,855
It was humiliating.

342
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:29,193
And then what?

343
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:32,394
It was humiliating.
What more do you want?

344
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:35,532
They could have eated you.

345
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:38,669
Yeah. Yeah.

346
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:42,075
I guess my pitiful cries for mercy
appealed to their better nature.

347
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:45,415
Can I appeal to your better nature?

348
00:21:46,184 --> 00:21:49,381
Nice try, kid, but no.

349
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:53,491
No. No. No!

350
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:55,490
What you doing down there, flipper bird?

351
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:56,650
Get up here.

352
00:21:56,828 --> 00:21:58,455
Get back up here this minute.

353
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,791
Oh, great. You let him get away.
Didn't you?

354
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:02,263
All your screwy alien talk.

355
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:04,698
- Hey, I'm an abductee.
- Abduct this.

356
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,498
- Don't make me call Uncle Angie.
- Oh, fine.

357
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:09,764
Where youse going? I'm an abductee!

358
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:13,502
- I don't care what you are, I'm hungry!
- Would you like to hear our specials?

359
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,944
How about fish? There's no fish.
How about penguin? There's no penguin.

360
00:22:17,115 --> 00:22:19,106
What are we gonna eat?!

361
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:33,632
<i>There's a world where I can go</i>

362
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:39,135
<i>And tell my secrets to</i>

363
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:41,465
<i>In my room</i>

364
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,076
<i>Paying no mind to his dancing heart...</i>

365
00:22:45,243 --> 00:22:49,577
<i>... the kid saw out his school days</i>
<i>at the back of the class...</i>

366
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:52,774
<i>... lost in his imaginings.</i>

367
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:56,619
<i>Now it's dark and I'm...</i>

368
00:22:57,055 --> 00:23:01,823
<i>What fabulous worlds lay out there,</i>
<i>far beyond the ice?</i>

369
00:23:02,462 --> 00:23:04,987
<i>I won't be afraid</i>

370
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:06,964
<i>Was there any place...</i>

371
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:10,625
<i>... where one small penguin</i>
<i>without a Heartsong...</i>

372
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:13,499
<i>... could ever truly belong?</i>

373
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:17,439
<i>In my room</i>

374
00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:32,423
And so, a thousand generations ago...

375
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:36,119
...our forefathers
forsook our wings for flippers.

376
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:39,321
You graduates going to sea
for the first time...

377
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:42,195
...are to reap the benefits
of their wise choice.

378
00:23:42,969 --> 00:23:45,403
These are lean and uncertain times.

379
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:48,335
But by the power
of the ancient penguin wisdoms...

380
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:51,602
...we, my brethren, will endure.

381
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:54,576
- "Blah, blah, blah."
- Norma Jean.

382
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:58,649
Who is he to say my boy can't graduate?
He's not hurting anyone.

383
00:23:58,818 --> 00:24:03,346
- True to our ways
and you will always be worthy of this...

384
00:24:03,523 --> 00:24:08,654
...our brave penguin nation. <i>Excelsior!</i>

385
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:23,671
Ocean, here I come!

386
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:29,040
You know what? We're gonna have
a little graduation ceremony of our own.

387
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:30,580
- You mean it, Ma?
- You betcha.

388
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,412
<i>- Excelsior!</i>
<i>- Excelsior!</i>

389
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:36,114
Keep it down.

390
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:38,723
- Pa.
- Memphis.

391
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,329
- Go get them, tiger.
- Thanks, Ma.

392
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:49,263
- Make every moment count!
- Got you, Ma!

393
00:24:49,435 --> 00:24:51,528
- Remember, "Stranger Danger."
- Yeah, sure, Pa.

394
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:55,902
And watch out for those leopard seals
and them killer whales.

395
00:24:56,075 --> 00:24:57,440
Mark this, Noah.

396
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:03,105
That boy was always a bad egg.
I'm telling you, no good will come of this.

397
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,522
Guys!

398
00:25:15,562 --> 00:25:17,462
Wait up!

399
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:43,149
What do you think?

400
00:25:43,323 --> 00:25:46,087
- You first.
- No, you first.

401
00:25:47,227 --> 00:25:49,695
No. No, no, no.

402
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:55,461
Stop pushing!

403
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:03,340
- What was that?
- I think it was the fuzzball.

404
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:10,609
See any blood?

405
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:15,919
What you waiting for?

406
00:27:14,148 --> 00:27:15,740
Hey, Gloria!

407
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:19,318
Gloria, I adore-ia. I'd like to see more-ia.

408
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:21,148
Gloria.

409
00:27:40,174 --> 00:27:42,472
- Mumble?
- Gloria.

410
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:48,438
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

411
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:51,141
Fall back, coming through!

412
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:13,606
Gloria? All my life,
I've wanted to say that you're so...

413
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,834
- Fish.
- Yeah. You're so fish.

414
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,069
No. Fish!

415
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:20,111
Fish!

416
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:23,141
Oh, that's mine.

417
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:32,058
- That's lousy.
- You didn't get one?

418
00:28:35,863 --> 00:28:36,955
Sorry.

419
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:38,359
Gloria. You got one?

420
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,001
- Nope. Not this time.
- You have it.

421
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:43,865
- Thank you, Mumble, but it's yours.
- I want you to have it.

422
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:46,700
- No. You caught it. You eat it.
- I want you to...

423
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:49,104
Skua! You get back here!

424
00:28:56,851 --> 00:29:00,412
- Come on.
- Mumble! Let go!

425
00:29:00,588 --> 00:29:03,580
Mumble! Let go!

426
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:10,290
You just let him get away!

427
00:29:19,073 --> 00:29:22,043
- Is he breathing?
- He's certainly not eating.

428
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:25,612
Mumble? Are you okay?

429
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:27,949
Mumble?

430
00:29:29,318 --> 00:29:31,980
Take the fish.

431
00:29:32,154 --> 00:29:34,622
- What?
- Take the stupid fish.

432
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,883
Oh, okay.

433
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:49,066
Thank you, Mumble.

434
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,472
You're welcome.

435
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,201
<i>- Somebody to</i>

436

<i>Love</i>

437

On this, our night of graduation,
infatuation, illumination...

438
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,917
...top of the class, Missy Gloria.

439

440

What's wrong with you?

458
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,077
- Mumble.
- Yeah?

459
00:31:10,252 --> 00:31:12,049
- It's better you just...
- Yeah, I know.

460
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:15,122
- You listen. You know?
- Yeah.

461
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,587
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

462
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:18,453
- Sorry.
- Sing the song.

463
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,596
You're great. That was great.

<i>Oh, baby, find me</i>

465
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:27,166
Come on. Put your flippers

<i>Find me somebody to love</i>

467

I'm searching high and low.

471
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:45,513
I'm searching the high and low.

472
00:31:45,855 --> 00:31:48,915
Yes, there's somebody out there
who needs to find me.

473
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:51,458

- Who do you think you are?
- Yeah, you're spoiling it for everybody.

481
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:21,856
- Take a flying leap.
- Yeah, jump in the lake.

482
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:32,964

Okay, fellas. Cut it out.

486
00:33:14,777 --> 00:33:17,541
I'm completely terrified.

487
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:20,242
Gloria?

488
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:22,911
Guys?

489
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:28,653
Get up here or I'll come in after you.

490
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:03,710
- Safe!
- Oh, yeah!

491
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:06,082
- You the bomb, bro.
- That's a 9.8.

492
00:35:06,256 --> 00:35:07,484
- I give you 10.
- Why?

493
00:35:10,394 --> 00:35:13,192
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.
Bring it. Bring it on.

494
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:15,558
- Kiss my frozen tushy.
- Kiss it. Kiss it.

495
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:22,903
Come here, sausage.
I take you with ketchup.

496
00:35:23,073 --> 00:35:25,564
But first you got to catch up.

497
00:35:25,742 --> 00:35:28,734
Oh, here he comes.
You better move in a half an hour.

498
00:35:28,912 --> 00:35:35,875
Let's get out of here.

499
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,382
- Hey, amigo, do that again.
- Do what?

500
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:41,649
- That thing with the...
- The clickety-clickety.

501
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:42,814
- That.
- Yeah, do it.

502
00:35:42,993 --> 00:35:46,589
- Come on, come on.
- Well, I just kind of go:

503
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,496
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, nice.

504
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,931
And then this:

505
00:35:56,274 --> 00:35:59,038
Way to go! It's amazing!

506
00:36:01,546 --> 00:36:04,106
- Oh, the little whisker.
- Look at him.

507
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:07,581
Oh, he's leaving.
Oh, no, that was his face!

508
00:36:07,752 --> 00:36:10,414
Remember, dumplings,
I know where you live.

509
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:12,522
Yeah, it's called land, lard face.

510
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:15,218
Flop back anytime, rubber butt!

511
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:20,561
See you, fatty.

512
00:36:20,732 --> 00:36:22,666
That's cool. "See you, fatty!"

513
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:25,564
Did it take you a while
to come up with that one?

514
00:36:25,737 --> 00:36:27,398
All right, way to go, tall guy.

515
00:36:27,572 --> 00:36:29,733
Give me fin, give me fin.

516
00:36:30,608 --> 00:36:33,202
<i>To the left, to the right</i>
<i>I'm getting it, oh, yes</i>

517
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:35,039
<i>Look out, here I go</i>

518
00:36:35,213 --> 00:36:39,411
<i>I got it, I got it, I don't, I had it</i>

519
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:41,575
Oh, my stomach hurts. I gotta pee.

520
00:36:42,854 --> 00:36:45,186
Ain't you coming, tall boy?

521
00:36:46,224 --> 00:36:49,193
What, you got something better to do?

522
00:36:50,395 --> 00:36:54,161
- No.
- Well, then, come along, Fluffy, let's go.

523
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:12,608
Hey, stretch, you like to party?

524
00:37:12,784 --> 00:37:14,581
Party? I guess so.

525
00:37:14,752 --> 00:37:16,083
Well, stick with us, baby.

526
00:37:16,254 --> 00:37:19,280
Yeah, because we practically
own the action here.

527
00:37:19,457 --> 00:37:21,448
<i>Mambo!</i>

528
00:37:23,394 --> 00:37:25,828
Everybody's so... spontan-you-us.

529
00:37:25,997 --> 00:37:27,692
Spontan-you-us!

530
00:37:27,865 --> 00:37:29,162
And these are the bad times!

531
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:32,667
- Yeah, our food chain go loco.
- Everyone a bit down.

532
00:37:32,837 --> 00:37:35,567
But it ain't gonna stop no party!

533
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,633
- Viva la party!
- Watch me work.

534
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,779
Gosh, he's eating rocks.

535
00:37:42,547 --> 00:37:45,710
- You hear what he said?
- "Eating rocks."

536
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:47,544
But he had a rock in his mouth.

537
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:51,087
That's no rock, hombre. It's love stones.

538
00:37:51,256 --> 00:37:54,248
- For building the nest.
- The one with the most pebbles wins.

539
00:37:54,426 --> 00:37:56,792
You know:

540
00:37:56,996 --> 00:37:58,987
You're not interested in <i>chicas?</i>

541
00:37:59,164 --> 00:38:00,461
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You kidding?

542
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:03,625
Without us, the <i>chicas</i> got no boom.

543
00:38:04,536 --> 00:38:07,369
- Why aren't you collecting pebbles?
- Pebbles, schmebbles, man.

544
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:11,134
We got personality, with a capital Y.
Why? Because we're hot.

545
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:14,074
Watch and learn, tall boy.

546
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:16,908
- Hey. Hey, baby.
- Over here, mama. Chicky baby.

547
00:38:17,082 --> 00:38:18,515
- Baby.
- What are you looking at?

548
00:38:18,684 --> 00:38:20,311
- You looking at me?
- Come over here.

549
00:38:20,486 --> 00:38:23,114
- Come on, <i>mamí.</i>
- You see something you like, yes?

550
00:38:23,288 --> 00:38:25,813
I don't think so. Not tonight, baby.

551
00:38:25,991 --> 00:38:28,619
Oh, don't be so snooty, booty.

552
00:38:28,794 --> 00:38:31,627
<i>That's the way... you like it, you like it</i>

553
00:38:31,797 --> 00:38:34,698
<i>You want it, I got it</i>
<i>Could've had it, you missed it</i>

554
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:36,801
Look at the feet, huh?

555
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:41,100
- Where'd you learn that?
- The big guy.

556
00:38:41,273 --> 00:38:42,797
- He from out of town.
- He with us.

557
00:38:42,975 --> 00:38:46,467
- Do it again.
- Do it, baby. Show me those flipping feet.

558
00:38:46,645 --> 00:38:50,308
- No, no, no. Sorry, girls.
- Some other time maybe.

559
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:53,246
You guys are soft in the head, okay?

560
00:38:53,786 --> 00:38:54,775
Let's go.

561
00:38:54,953 --> 00:38:58,047
- Leave them wanting more, you know?
- Hold back till the season.

562
00:38:58,457 --> 00:39:00,982
- You show them what you got.
- Either you got it or not.

563
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,788
- And the Amigos?
- We got it!

564
00:39:05,664 --> 00:39:07,222
You think I could get some of it?

565
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:12,200
Hombre, you've got so much already,
you dangerous, baby.

566
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:13,929
You really think so?

567
00:39:14,106 --> 00:39:15,835
You kidding? With moves like yours...

568
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:18,476
...you must have all the ladies
drooling at your feet.

569
00:39:18,644 --> 00:39:22,808
- I wouldn't say that.
- Oh, listen to him. He's so cute.

570
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:24,471
Let me tell something to you.

571
00:39:24,883 --> 00:39:28,751
Except for me, tall boy,
you got the most charisma of anybody.

572
00:39:28,921 --> 00:39:32,448
Put that ego away, Ramon,
you're gonna hurt someone.

573
00:39:32,624 --> 00:39:36,526
You so jealous. Just a moment.
I hear people wanting something.

574
00:39:36,695 --> 00:39:38,788
Me!

575
00:39:39,898 --> 00:39:42,389
<i>- Mambo</i>
<i>- Okay, you girlies, Mambo</i>

576
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:46,095
<i>One more time now, mambo</i>
<i>Mambo, mambo, mambo</i>

577
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:48,262
<i>Mambo!</i>

578
00:40:08,428 --> 00:40:11,522
Your turn, your turn.

579
00:40:11,698 --> 00:40:13,427
Oh, get down.

580
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:23,640
Man, this guy is so accidentally cool.

581
00:40:25,044 --> 00:40:26,636
Okay, okay.

582
00:40:26,813 --> 00:40:27,939
Mama!

583
00:40:41,094 --> 00:40:43,153
Mommy!

584
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:07,419
Come on, Fluffy.

585
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,014
Oh, I love gravity.

586
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:15,525
- Oh, I feel like reminiscing.
- Remin-icing?

587
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:44,951
- It was too close.
- Come on, come on.

588
00:42:47,154 --> 00:42:49,622
Hey, guys! Where are we going?

589
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,917
- We relocating.
- Placing ourselves elsewhere.

590
00:42:52,092 --> 00:42:55,061
- But that thing, what was it?
- How should we know?

591
00:42:55,229 --> 00:42:57,629
- We're penguins.
- Very little penguins.

592
00:42:57,798 --> 00:43:01,757
But where did it come from?
It's so weird, so alien.

593
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:04,336
- What's he talking about?
- Some hombre called Elian.

594
00:43:04,505 --> 00:43:06,973
I don't know a guy Elian.
I knew a guy named Estevan...

595
00:43:07,141 --> 00:43:09,473
- Not Estevan, Elian.
- Guys, we have a mystery here.

596
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:10,769
A mind-boggling mystery.

597
00:43:10,945 --> 00:43:12,879
So? What are we
supposed to do about it?

598
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:15,277
Amigos, we gotta get
to the bottom of this thing.

599
00:43:16,116 --> 00:43:21,418
Big guy, let me tell something to you.
Come close. Don't be afraid.

600
00:43:21,588 --> 00:43:23,283
- You want answers?
- Yeah.

601
00:43:23,457 --> 00:43:24,822
- That's all you need?
- Yeah.

602
00:43:24,992 --> 00:43:25,981
- Nothing else?
- No.

603
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,525
Then this is very easy.

604
00:43:27,695 --> 00:43:28,855
You go see Lovelace.

605
00:43:29,997 --> 00:43:31,624
- Lovelace.
- Go see Lovelace.

606
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:33,790
- Genius, Ramon. You are the man.
- Thank you.

607
00:43:33,968 --> 00:43:35,731
- I take a moment for myself.
- Let's go.

608
00:43:35,903 --> 00:43:37,165
- Bow down.
- You the man.

609
00:43:37,338 --> 00:43:39,670
- That's enough, I feel your love.
- Who's Lovelace?

610
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,172
- Lovelace is the guru.
- Go see Lovelace.

611
00:43:42,343 --> 00:43:44,436
- He got the answer to everything.
- Everything.

612
00:43:44,611 --> 00:43:46,704
- Really?
- Ask him, he never wrong.

613
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,145
But first, you gonna need a pebble.

614
00:43:54,555 --> 00:43:58,252
<i>Hold it, y'all. I have a warning</i>
<i>for the audience.</i>

615
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:02,392
<i>Ladies, please, avert your eyes...</i>

616
00:44:02,563 --> 00:44:05,896
<i>... because I've been known to hypnotize.</i>

617
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:10,203
<i>You heard the voice,</i>
<i>now you're about to meet...</i>

618
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:14,399
<i>... the one and only Lovelace,</i>
<i>in the flesh...</i>

619
00:44:14,576 --> 00:44:19,639
<i>... right here, right on, right now.</i>

620
00:44:19,814 --> 00:44:23,147
The devotion, please.

621
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:25,046
Oh, yeah.

622
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,745
And now, your question.

623
00:44:27,922 --> 00:44:29,355
Señor Lovelace...

624
00:44:29,891 --> 00:44:33,054
...my wife has disappeared. Is she alive?

625
00:44:36,197 --> 00:44:39,963
<i>Is she alive now?</i>
<i>Separate the truth from the jive</i>

626
00:44:40,168 --> 00:44:43,729
<i>Speak to me, oh, mystic beings</i>

627
00:44:46,107 --> 00:44:49,099
Yes! She's happy
and you're in her thoughts.

628
00:44:49,277 --> 00:44:51,006
Is she with another male?

629
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:54,114
One pebble, one question. Next!

630
00:44:54,282 --> 00:44:57,308
Oh, Serene One.
Please ask the mystic beings...

631
00:44:57,485 --> 00:44:59,077
...will I ever be as rich as you?

632
00:44:59,554 --> 00:45:02,546
In your dreams, Jean. Next!

633
00:45:02,724 --> 00:45:04,715
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Get up there, big guy.

634
00:45:04,893 --> 00:45:08,761
- That's it. Don't be scared.
- Gentleman, please! One at a time.

635
00:45:09,397 --> 00:45:10,864
- We with him.
- Yeah, we together.

636
00:45:11,032 --> 00:45:13,466
- He got a beautiful question. Go.
- Do it.

637
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:15,159
Just don't look him in the eye.

638
00:45:15,336 --> 00:45:17,327
Have you ever been abducted by aliens?

639
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,330
Excuse me?
What kind of question is that? Next!

640
00:45:20,508 --> 00:45:21,497
No, wait, señor.

641
00:45:21,676 --> 00:45:25,976
I met a skua once, with something like that
on his foot, said he was abducted by aliens.

642
00:45:26,147 --> 00:45:30,914
This, friend, is my sacred talisman...

643
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,615
<i>Talisman, talisman</i>

644
00:45:33,788 --> 00:45:37,451
...bestowed on me by the mystic beings...

645
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:40,150
<i>Mystic beings</i>

646
00:45:40,328 --> 00:45:44,230
...during my epic journey
of enlightenment...

647
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,523
...to the forbidden shore.

648
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:48,999
<i>Forbidden shore</i>

649
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,195
Oh, say it one more.

650
00:45:51,372 --> 00:45:54,933
<i>- Forbidden shore</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah</i>

651
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,010
Wait, you saw mystic beings?

652
00:45:57,178 --> 00:46:00,477
I hear them! They speak through me!

653
00:46:00,648 --> 00:46:02,707
Oh, yeah.

654
00:46:02,884 --> 00:46:05,876
There's a power that makes me
stand upon this tower!

655
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:09,080
Did they have front-ways eyes?
Did they probe you? Strap you down?

656
00:46:09,257 --> 00:46:12,658
Enough! "Did they probe me?"

657
00:46:12,827 --> 00:46:15,625
Too many questions!
You don't have enough pebbles, fool.

658
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:17,996
You haven't answered
any of my questions.

659
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:21,762
- How many questions he got?
- We've all got stuff to ask!

660
00:46:26,108 --> 00:46:27,700
Enough!

661
00:46:29,211 --> 00:46:31,736
You bring this stranger before me.

662
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:36,476
He doubts my powers.
He compares me to a skua.

663
00:46:36,852 --> 00:46:38,843
The voices are shrieking in my head.

664
00:46:39,021 --> 00:46:41,922
They say, "Lovelace, who is this fool?

665
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:47,591
Tell him! Tell him to go forth
and multiply!"

666
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,354
Come to think of it...

667
00:46:49,532 --> 00:46:53,298
...why don't we all go forth and multiply?

668
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:55,630
- Lovelace.
- What he saying?

669
00:46:55,804 --> 00:46:57,601
- It's mating season.
- Already?

670
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:01,800
I will retire now
to my couch of perpetual indulgence.

671
00:47:01,977 --> 00:47:04,411
- Okay, ladies, who's first?
- Me!

672
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,344
One at a time. Don't touch the talisman,
baby, please.

673
00:47:07,516 --> 00:47:10,781
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What about us?

674
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,717
<i>Lovelace, Lovelace, Lovelace!</i>

675
00:47:13,889 --> 00:47:15,652
Hear me!

676
00:47:15,824 --> 00:47:17,849
There's not enough love in the world.

677
00:47:18,027 --> 00:47:20,086
Turn to the penguin next to you.

678
00:47:20,262 --> 00:47:22,662
Put your flippers up.
Fluff him up a little bit.

679
00:47:22,831 --> 00:47:25,299
And give him a great big hug.

680
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,628
Okay, ladies.

681
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,169
Oh, make that little noise again, girl.

682
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:33,900
Hey, what he got we don't got, man?

683
00:47:34,076 --> 00:47:35,941
- What you hugging me for?
- He told me to.

684
00:47:36,111 --> 00:47:37,339
- Get away.
- No, you like it.

685
00:47:37,513 --> 00:47:38,537
Get off him, Ramon.

686
00:47:38,714 --> 00:47:40,705
Stretch, got any stones
where you come from?

687
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:43,010
- We don't collect stones.
- You don't? Why not?

688
00:47:43,185 --> 00:47:44,174
We live on the ice.

689
00:47:44,353 --> 00:47:46,150
So how you win the heart of the ladies?

690
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,813
Well, we sing.

691
00:47:50,426 --> 00:47:53,418
- Stop! That's crazy!
- You're kidding, right?

692
00:47:53,596 --> 00:47:55,427
No. We sing to each other.

693
00:47:55,598 --> 00:47:58,590
If someone special likes your song,
you know...

694
00:47:58,767 --> 00:48:00,598
Oh, and you have someone special?

695
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:04,102
- A tall beauty in your dark romantic past?
- Of which you never speak?

696
00:48:04,273 --> 00:48:05,365
Well, sort of.

697
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:08,339
Hey, let's go check it out.
Maybe she got some friends.

698
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,499
I like them tall.

699
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,077
It's never gonna work.

700
00:48:11,247 --> 00:48:13,010
- Hey, big guy.
- It's the loving season.

701
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,672
All you gotta do is sing.

702
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,317
That's the problem. I can't.

703
00:48:16,485 --> 00:48:18,953
- You a bird, ain't you?
- All birds can sing.

704
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:21,385
<i>I don't sing like the birdie do</i>

705
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:24,115
All right.

706
00:48:24,293 --> 00:48:25,851
<i>Find me, find me</i>

707
00:48:26,295 --> 00:48:29,060
What's he doing?

708
00:48:29,232 --> 00:48:31,962
- I think he's singing.
- I know singing, that's not singing.

709
00:48:34,004 --> 00:48:37,531
I heard an animal once do that,
but then they rolled him over, he was dead.

710
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:41,533
Yeah. And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.

711
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:43,474
You in tragic shape, man.

712
00:48:43,647 --> 00:48:45,808
- Don't worry. We can fix it.
- We can?

713
00:48:45,982 --> 00:48:48,143
- Absolutely. We can. We can.
- We can?

714
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:50,752
- Really?
- Yes! Let me tell something to you.

715
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,287
- Come close. Closer. You wanna sing?
- Yeah.

716
00:48:54,457 --> 00:48:55,947
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

717
00:48:56,126 --> 00:48:58,526
You making fun of me?
Then this is very easy.

718
00:48:58,695 --> 00:49:01,789
Really? Gosh, if I could sing,
that would change everything.

719
00:49:01,965 --> 00:49:06,163
You will sing. You just got to do
exactly what I say.

720
00:49:06,336 --> 00:49:08,463
- Okay.
- Did I say "okay"?

721
00:49:08,638 --> 00:49:10,128
- No.
- No. What did I say?

722
00:49:10,307 --> 00:49:13,834
- Do exactly what you say.
- Exactly what I say.

723
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:22,207
<i>Don't push me</i>
<i>'Cause I'm close to the edge</i>

724
00:49:24,287 --> 00:49:28,553
<i>I'm trying not to lose my...</i>

725
00:49:29,526 --> 00:49:31,084
<i>Gloria</i>

726
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:33,456
<i>It's like a jungle sometimes</i>
<i>It makes me wonder</i>

727
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:34,858
<i>How I keep from going under</i>

728
00:49:35,031 --> 00:49:38,728
<i>Midnight creeps so slowly</i>

729
00:49:38,902 --> 00:49:45,364
<i>Into hearts of those</i>
<i>Who need more than they get</i>

730
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:49,774
<i>Daylight deals a bad hand</i>

731
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:55,612
<i>To a penguin who has laid too many bets</i>

732
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,577
<i>I'll make love to you</i>
<i>Like you want me to</i>

733
00:49:59,756 --> 00:50:02,691
<i>And I'll hold you tight, baby, all...</i>

734
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:04,121
<i>Gloria</i>

735
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:09,755
<i>The mirror stares you in the face</i>

736
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:11,764
<i>And says, "Baby..."</i>

737
00:50:11,935 --> 00:50:13,163
<i>Shake a bon-bon, Shake a...</i>

738
00:50:13,336 --> 00:50:14,803
<i>It don't work</i>

739
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:20,102
<i>You say your prayers</i>
<i>Though you don't care</i>

740
00:50:20,276 --> 00:50:26,340
<i>You say your prayers</i>
<i>Though you don't care</i>

741
00:50:26,516 --> 00:50:29,007
Boys! Boys!

742
00:50:29,185 --> 00:50:31,085
Boys!

743
00:50:51,442 --> 00:50:52,431
Mumble?

744
00:50:58,115 --> 00:50:59,104
Mumble.

745
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:03,511
Oh, hi, Gloria.

746
00:51:09,994 --> 00:51:11,621
And this is you?

747
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:15,922
Sure, it's me. You like?

748
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:21,367
Well, I would, if it were really you, yeah.

749
00:51:22,473 --> 00:51:24,270
Well, it is me, sort of.

750
00:51:24,442 --> 00:51:26,137
Yeah.

751
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,141
Turn around.

752
00:51:28,312 --> 00:51:29,870
- Turn around.
- Why?

753
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:32,106
- Well, why not?
- Well...

754
00:51:35,019 --> 00:51:36,452
- What do you know?
- Yeah.

755
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,815
<i>My way</i>

756
00:51:38,989 --> 00:51:41,423
- Gloria.
- Mumble, how could you?

757
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,118
Hello.

758
00:51:44,295 --> 00:51:48,254
I know size can be daunting,
but don't be afraid. I love you.

759
00:51:48,432 --> 00:51:50,559
- Gloria, please.
- I love you.

760
00:51:50,734 --> 00:51:51,826
- Gloria!
- Gloria!

761
00:51:52,002 --> 00:51:53,094
- Gloria!
- Gloria!

762
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,670
- Please, Gloria, wait!
- Please, Gloria, wait for me!

763
00:51:57,675 --> 00:51:58,903
- Stop it!
- Okay.

764
00:51:59,076 --> 00:52:02,239
Mumble, what could
you possibly be thinking?

765
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:04,438
I don't know what else to do.

766
00:52:10,554 --> 00:52:12,215
Oh, Gloria, no.

767
00:52:12,389 --> 00:52:15,654
<i>Gloria</i>

768
00:52:15,826 --> 00:52:19,728
<i>Gloria</i>

769
00:52:20,231 --> 00:52:21,289
Go up there, right now.

770
00:52:21,465 --> 00:52:25,799
<i>Daylight deals a bad hand...</i>

771
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:28,097
Gloria. Gloria.

772
00:52:28,272 --> 00:52:30,001
Sing to this.

773
00:52:32,443 --> 00:52:36,174
Mumble, you're embarrassing me.

774
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,684
Baby... it don't work.

775
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:49,720
<i>Baby</i>

776
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:01,730
<i>So slowly</i>

777
00:53:01,907 --> 00:53:06,469
<i>So slowly into hearts of those</i>

778
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:12,550
<i>Who need more than they get</i>

779
00:53:12,717 --> 00:53:16,744

<i>The mirror stares you in the face</i>

782
00:53:26,765 --> 00:53:30,599
<i>And says, "Baby... it don't work"</i>

783
00:53:30,769 --> 00:53:34,762
<i>You say your prayers</i>
<i>Though you don't care</i>

784
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:41,903
<i>You sing and you shake the hurt</i>

785
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,041
<i>Dance!</i>

786
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:52,012
<i>Boogie wonderland</i>

787
00:53:54,426 --> 00:53:56,894
<i>Dance</i>

788
00:53:57,062 --> 00:54:01,522

<i>My brothers</i>

00:54:56,222 --> 00:54:59,123
<i>You look so beautiful to me, baby</i>

806
00:55:08,668 --> 00:55:10,363
- Mumble.
- Hey, Miss Viola.

807
00:55:10,536 --> 00:55:16,168
<i>- All the love in the world can't be gone</i>
<i>- Mumble!</i>

<i>- All the need to be loved can't be wrong</i>
<i>- Mumble!</i>

809
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,038
Disgraceful!

810
00:55:24,717 --> 00:55:26,446
Who do they think they are?

811
00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:30,214
Where is Noah?
This is getting out of hand.

812
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:32,181
Go!

813
00:55:36,462 --> 00:55:38,862
Hey, Memphis. It's your boy, Mumble.

814
00:55:39,432 --> 00:55:42,265
- Mumble?
- Mumble?

815
00:55:42,435 --> 00:55:45,927
No, no. No, it's "Mambo." O!

816
00:55:46,105 --> 00:55:49,563
Baby. They're saying, "Mumble."

817
00:56:10,963 --> 00:56:11,987
Boogie!

818
00:56:12,264 --> 00:56:13,458
Behold, Noah, look!

819
00:56:13,632 --> 00:56:19,628
This was an omen from the start
and now we have this uprising.

820
00:56:19,805 --> 00:56:23,332
Stop! Stop!

821
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:27,309
Stop this unruly nonsense!

822
00:56:29,482 --> 00:56:31,950
Stop it right now!

823
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:35,619
A little self-control, if you please!

824
00:56:35,788 --> 00:56:40,487
You bring this disorder, this aberration,
to the very heart of our community.

825
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:41,921
Have you lost your minds?

826
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:43,857
- We're just having fun.
- Harmless fun.

827
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:48,261
"Harmless"? It is this kind of backsliding
that has brought the scarcity upon us.

828
00:56:48,434 --> 00:56:50,959
Excuse me, smiley. Can you speak
plain penguin, please?

829
00:56:51,137 --> 00:56:53,799
He thinks the food shortage
has something to do with me.

830
00:56:53,973 --> 00:56:57,637
Do you not understand that we can
only survive here when we're in harmony?

831
00:56:57,811 --> 00:57:01,042
When you and your foreign friends
lead us into your easy ways...

832
00:57:01,214 --> 00:57:02,841
...you offend the Great 'Guin.

833
00:57:03,016 --> 00:57:04,950
You invite him to withhold his bounty.

834
00:57:05,118 --> 00:57:08,713
- He rules the seasons.
- He giveth and he can taketh away.

835
00:57:08,889 --> 00:57:11,380
Wait a minute.
Happy feet can't cause a famine.

836
00:57:11,558 --> 00:57:15,153
If thy kind of pagan display
did not cause it, then what did?

837
00:57:15,328 --> 00:57:17,626
I think it comes from outside.
Way beyond the ice.

838
00:57:17,798 --> 00:57:20,130
There are things out there,
things we don't understand.

839
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,961
- Mysteries.
- Mind-boggling mysteries.

840
00:57:22,135 --> 00:57:23,534
- Mystic beings.
- Yeah, aliens.

841
00:57:23,703 --> 00:57:25,330
- He's mad.
- No, aliens.

842
00:57:25,505 --> 00:57:27,166
- I hear they're smart.
- He's insane.

843
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,968
No, they might be smarter than all of us.
Who knows?

844
00:57:30,143 --> 00:57:32,543
He drove the fish away,
now he's ranting this rubbish!

845
00:57:32,712 --> 00:57:35,977
- Hey, let me tell something to you.
- Don't touch me, you filthy vermin.

846
00:57:36,149 --> 00:57:37,980
- Hey, watch it.
- And so it follows.

847
00:57:38,151 --> 00:57:41,643
Dissent leads to division
and division leads us to doom.

848
00:57:41,822 --> 00:57:44,882
- You, Mumble Happy Feet, must go.
- Hear, hear.

849
00:57:45,058 --> 00:57:47,492
Don't you take one step, sweetheart.

850
00:57:47,661 --> 00:57:51,153
You have as much right to be here
as any of these daffy old fools.

851
00:57:51,998 --> 00:57:54,592
Norma Jean, I'll deal with this.

852
00:57:54,768 --> 00:57:56,235
Pa?

853
00:57:58,605 --> 00:58:01,597
Mumble, you must renounce
your so-called friends...

854
00:58:01,775 --> 00:58:03,800
...your peculiar thoughts,
your strange ways.

855
00:58:03,977 --> 00:58:05,342
- Memphis.
- If we are devout...

856
00:58:05,512 --> 00:58:07,639
...sincere in our praise,
the fish will return.

857
00:58:07,814 --> 00:58:11,079
- But, Pa...
- Listen, boy, I was a backslider myself.

858
00:58:11,251 --> 00:58:13,515
I was careless
and now we're paying the price.

859
00:58:13,687 --> 00:58:15,279
What's this got to do with Mumble?

860
00:58:15,455 --> 00:58:18,390
- It's why he is the way he is.
- There's nothing wrong with him!

861
00:58:18,558 --> 00:58:21,618
- Face it, our son's all messed up.
- He's not messed up, hear me?

862
00:58:21,795 --> 00:58:23,763
- Believe me, I know.
- How can you say that?

863
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:27,024
Because when he was just an egg,
I dropped him!

864
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,963
Memphis.

865
00:58:30,804 --> 00:58:32,362
Mumble.

866
00:58:34,674 --> 00:58:37,234
Oh, my poor little Mumble.

867
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:39,071
But, Mom, I'm perfectly fine.

868
00:58:39,246 --> 00:58:41,237
- No. No, you're not, boy.
- That's right.

869
00:58:41,414 --> 00:58:44,975
For all our sakes, you must stop
this freakiness with the feet.

870
00:58:45,151 --> 00:58:49,281
Your father speaks wisely.
Heed his suffering heart and repent.

871
00:58:49,456 --> 00:58:51,651
But it just doesn't make any sense.

872
00:58:51,825 --> 00:58:53,884
Then your arrogance leaves us no choice!

873
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,049
No, wait.

874
00:58:56,062 --> 00:59:00,328
Please, son, you can do this.
It ain't so hard.

875
00:59:02,269 --> 00:59:05,933
Don't ask me to change, Pa,
because I can't.

876
00:59:10,249 --> 00:59:14,151
And that, my brethren, is the end of it.

877
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,220
You, begone!

878
00:59:19,158 --> 00:59:22,457
- Mumble.
- No, Ma, it's okay. It's okay.

879
00:59:23,696 --> 00:59:26,358
Let me tell something to you.

880
00:59:26,532 --> 00:59:28,659
When I find out
what's happening to the fish...

881
00:59:29,535 --> 00:59:31,332
...I'll be back.

882
00:59:32,171 --> 00:59:33,798
Let me through? Let me through.

883
00:59:33,973 --> 00:59:36,066
- Mumble, you don't have to go.
- Let it be.

884
00:59:36,242 --> 00:59:38,710
- Gloria.
- No. No, Dad, this isn't fair.

885
00:59:38,878 --> 00:59:41,108
Gloria, listen to your father.

886
00:59:41,614 --> 00:59:47,177
<i>My folks were always putting him down</i>

887
00:59:47,353 --> 00:59:50,220
<i>Down, down, down</i>

888
00:59:50,389 --> 00:59:54,655
<i>They said he came</i>
<i>From the wrong side of town</i>

889
00:59:54,827 --> 00:59:58,319
<i>He came from the wrong side of town</i>

890
00:59:58,498 --> 01:00:01,592
<i>They told me he was bad</i>

891
01:00:01,768 --> 01:00:02,860
<i>So bad</i>

892
01:00:03,035 --> 01:00:06,971
<i>- But I know he was sad</i>
<i>- So sad</i>

893
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:12,305
<i>I'll never forget him</i>
<i>The leader of the pack</i>

894
01:00:12,478 --> 01:00:16,312
We sing the heart
of our true friend, Mumble.

895
01:00:16,482 --> 01:00:22,478
You are a nation of peeny-weeny,
piffling, <i>piccolini,</i> piddly-diddly pouft!

896
01:00:23,723 --> 01:00:25,623
Together, we prevail.

897
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:27,657
In the wisdoms, we trust.

898
01:00:27,827 --> 01:00:29,761
We trust.

899
01:00:31,898 --> 01:00:34,731
<i>Look out</i>

900
01:00:34,901 --> 01:00:39,429
<i>Look out</i>

901
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:43,208
<i>Look out</i>

902
01:00:43,376 --> 01:00:48,006
<i>Look</i>

903
01:00:48,181 --> 01:00:52,277
<i>Look out</i>

904
01:00:55,955 --> 01:01:00,153
Don't worry, tall guy.
My father also called me a pitiful loser.

905
01:01:00,326 --> 01:01:01,452
Look how I turn out.

906
01:01:01,627 --> 01:01:02,821
You're not helping, Ramon.

907
01:01:02,995 --> 01:01:06,692
He gonna be okay. All he gotta do
is find out what happened to the fish.

908
01:01:06,866 --> 01:01:08,834
- How he gonna do that?
- He think of something.

909
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:10,992
- The aliens.
- What?

910
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:14,004
- I'm gonna talk to the aliens.
- How you gonna find aliens?

911
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:16,734
- Lovelace.
- He don't like you. He don't like you at all.

912
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:19,003
That's okay. I'll appeal
to his better nature.

913
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:21,647
- How you gonna do that?
- Cruel and unusual punishment?

914
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:24,306
- Unimaginable torture?
- Imaginable torture?

915
01:01:24,484 --> 01:01:26,679
- Your singing?
- No!

916
01:01:26,854 --> 01:01:29,186
<i>"Can anybody find me"...</i>

917
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:32,252
- You're cracking the ice!
- Avalanche!

918
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:34,087
Yes, okay. Thank you.

919
01:01:44,504 --> 01:01:47,405
Lovelace. You there?

920
01:01:47,574 --> 01:01:49,701
Lovelace!

921
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:54,376
Lovelace.

922
01:01:59,419 --> 01:02:01,046
Lovelace?

923
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:02,552
Is this a bad time?

924
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:04,657
I know we don't have
an appointment, but...

925
01:02:04,825 --> 01:02:06,952
Just one question and
I want a straight answer.

926
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:08,719
Where do I find the mystic beings?

927
01:02:11,565 --> 01:02:13,556
Why don't he speak?

928
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:18,197
Lovelace, you okay?

929
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:22,870
- Boy, he's possessed.
- It's a seizure! It's a seizure!

930
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:24,510
- Open the beak.
- Grab his tongue.

931
01:02:24,678 --> 01:02:27,272
He's choking. That thing
around his neck, it's too tight.

932
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:30,075
- Well, why didn't you say so?
- On three.

933
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:34,516
Stop! Listen! No! Amigos! Amigos! Stop!

934
01:02:34,688 --> 01:02:36,679
- What?
- You're hurting him.

935
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:40,226
Any better?

936
01:02:40,394 --> 01:02:42,919
Lovelace, how did you get
that thing around your neck?

937
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:46,429
- It was bestowed on him.
- By the mystic beings.

938
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,761
- They didn't bestow it?
- No.

939
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:51,928
Oh, come on, he don't know
what he's saying.

940
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:55,097
You were swimming
and it just got caught around your neck.

941
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:58,176
Oh, no way. He the guru.

942
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:02,376
Lovelace, did you ever actually meet
a mystic being?

943
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:04,743
Officially?

944
01:03:06,219 --> 01:03:07,208
No.

945
01:03:07,387 --> 01:03:09,321
I knew it! It's all a lie.

946
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:11,354
But this belongs to someone.

947
01:03:11,525 --> 01:03:14,221
If we could find them,
I bet you they could take it off.

948
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:18,861
Show me where you found it. I'm sure
they could help us. You and me both.

949
01:03:21,703 --> 01:03:23,603
Two words, three syllables.

950
01:03:23,771 --> 01:03:25,568
- What is it?
- You're dying?

951
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:29,437
No, no, wait. Past, past, your past life.

952
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,202
You're passing gas.

953
01:03:32,613 --> 01:03:34,604
Now he thinks he's an elephant seal.

954
01:03:34,782 --> 01:03:36,716
No, no, no. Go over the mountains.

955
01:03:36,884 --> 01:03:39,819
- Go over the mountains!
- Through the land of the elephant seals.

956
01:03:39,988 --> 01:03:44,584
- Beyond the land of the elephant seals.
- Beyond the land of the elephant seals!

957
01:03:55,536 --> 01:03:57,697
- Wait.
- What?

958
01:03:58,606 --> 01:04:00,597
I hear voices.

959
01:04:00,775 --> 01:04:02,436
- There is a voice.
- Where?

960
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:06,171
- There's a little voice on the wind.
- Mumble!

961
01:04:06,347 --> 01:04:07,644
- "Mambo"?
- "Mambo"?

962
01:04:07,815 --> 01:04:09,248
- Listen.
- Mumble Happy Feet.

963
01:04:09,784 --> 01:04:11,012
- Gloria?
- Gloria!

964
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:12,174
Gloria?

965
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:14,878
Hey, you got a stalker.
She's obsessed with you, man.

966
01:04:18,493 --> 01:04:20,961
I can't believe it's you.

967
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:23,188
Of course it's me.

968
01:04:24,499 --> 01:04:26,194
What are you doing here?

969
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,564
<i>All the love in the world can't be gone</i>

970
01:04:29,737 --> 01:04:33,605
<i>All the need to be loved can't be wrong</i>

971
01:04:33,775 --> 01:04:36,505
- Oh, my.
- So which way, twinkletoes?

972
01:04:36,677 --> 01:04:40,044
No, no, no. If you come,
you may never get back home.

973
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:41,579
Fine by me.

974
01:04:41,749 --> 01:04:47,210
Gloria, you have a life back there.
I don't. I mean, we don't. Not out here.

975
01:04:47,388 --> 01:04:50,482
How can we keep an egg safe?
That's if we ever had an egg.

976
01:04:50,658 --> 01:04:53,252
Well, I don't need an egg to be happy.

977
01:04:53,428 --> 01:04:57,455
You say that now, but what about later
when all your friends have eggs?

978
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:00,061
Then I'll have you.

979
01:05:01,502 --> 01:05:04,903
Now he's going to pledge
his soul forever.

980
01:05:05,073 --> 01:05:06,199
- Gloria.
- Here it comes.

981
01:05:06,374 --> 01:05:13,303
I'm a particular kind of guy,
the kind of guy who needs his own space.

982
01:05:13,581 --> 01:05:15,446
It's not you, it's me.

983
01:05:15,616 --> 01:05:18,050
I'm just not up for a serious relationship
right now.

984
01:05:18,219 --> 01:05:21,552
What he's trying to do now
is he's pushing her away. Let's watch.

985
01:05:21,722 --> 01:05:25,214
No matter what you say or do,
you're stuck with me.

986
01:05:25,393 --> 01:05:28,488
Oh, come on. As if you're not
totally thrilled that I'm here.

987
01:05:28,664 --> 01:05:32,122
- Now she got him on the ropes.
- See, right there is your problem.

988
01:05:32,301 --> 01:05:34,201
You think you're irresistible, don't you?

989
01:05:34,369 --> 01:05:36,701
I don't care where you're from,
that's got to hurt.

990
01:05:36,872 --> 01:05:39,602
- Excuse me?
- Gloria's so gorgeous, Gloria's so talented.

991
01:05:39,775 --> 01:05:40,764
What?

992
01:05:40,943 --> 01:05:43,343
Just because
you can hit a few high notes.

993
01:05:43,512 --> 01:05:45,639
You got a problem with my singing?

994
01:05:45,814 --> 01:05:48,044
No, it's perfectly fine.

995
01:05:48,217 --> 01:05:50,082
- "Fine"?
- If you like that sort of thing.

996
01:05:50,252 --> 01:05:52,846
- It's a little Nana Tootsie for my taste.
- What?

997
01:05:53,021 --> 01:05:55,148
You know, showy, flashy, froufrou.

998
01:05:55,324 --> 01:05:56,814
- "Froufrou"?
- That's right.

999
01:05:56,992 --> 01:06:01,122
Coming from someone who thinks it's cool
to jig up and down really fast on the spot...

1000
01:06:01,296 --> 01:06:03,560
...like some twitchy idiot.

1001
01:06:07,336 --> 01:06:09,964
You stubborn, hippity-hoppity fool!

1002
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:12,004
Right back at you.

1003
01:06:22,351 --> 01:06:24,842
Amigo, that was a good thing you do.

1004
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:27,284
She is going to be so much better off
without you.

1005
01:06:27,456 --> 01:06:30,584
She is going to find a good, steady guy
to comfort her...

1006
01:06:30,759 --> 01:06:33,956
...and love her up real good
and raise a big family.

1007
01:06:34,129 --> 01:06:36,359
- Ramon.
- And then she's going to let herself go...

1008
01:06:36,532 --> 01:06:39,660
Ramon. He's hurting. He's hurting bad.

1009
01:06:39,835 --> 01:06:44,499
Oh, listen, listen, don't hold it in
or you explode. You got to let it out.

1010
01:06:44,673 --> 01:06:47,369
You just let it out. You let it out.

1011
01:06:47,543 --> 01:06:50,410
Everybody, turn away for a moment.

1012
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:52,877
<i>If she leave him now</i>

1013
01:06:53,048 --> 01:06:58,247
<i>She take away the biggest part of him</i>

1014
01:07:00,622 --> 01:07:02,556
<i>Don't, baby, please, don't go</i>

1015
01:07:02,724 --> 01:07:04,589
Please, guys.

1016
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,751
No more singing.

1017
01:07:17,339 --> 01:07:20,001
Then she say to me, "Enough,
you are making me nauseous."

1018
01:07:20,175 --> 01:07:23,906
So I become silent, almost moody,
and you know what she says?

1019
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,138
"You never share. You got to let it out."

1020
01:07:26,315 --> 01:07:29,079
- Ramon, come on.
- Let it out. Let it out.

1021
01:07:29,251 --> 01:07:30,684
Stop it! Let it go.

1022
01:07:30,852 --> 01:07:34,516
- I never had a good relationship in my life.
- Give him a hug. Give him a hug.

1023
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:35,919
- I let it out!
- There we go.

1024
01:07:36,092 --> 01:07:38,652
- I let it out.
- I know. Get over it.

1025
01:07:38,828 --> 01:07:41,626
- Can you keep going?
- Yeah.

1026
01:07:41,798 --> 01:07:44,995
- What's that smell?
- It wasn't me.

1027
01:07:46,135 --> 01:07:49,901
Hey, Fluffy, we're following you.
Get up here.

1028
01:07:58,047 --> 01:08:02,108
So these elephant seals,
they're not penguin eaters, are they?

1029
01:08:02,285 --> 01:08:04,685
I don't know.
I believe they are herbivores.

1030
01:08:04,854 --> 01:08:06,719
- What?
- You know, kelp-suckers.

1031
01:08:06,889 --> 01:08:09,221
Here we go, Lovelace. Come on.

1032
01:08:10,893 --> 01:08:12,758
Jump in time. Jump in time.

1033
01:08:12,929 --> 01:08:15,693
- Okay, let's do it.
- Okay, okay, okay. Ready?

1034
01:08:18,901 --> 01:08:21,301
I can do this. I can do this.
I got to trick myself.

1035
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:23,371
Boy, look at that. What?

1036
01:08:39,322 --> 01:08:43,884
You blokes better be lost,
because trespassing's a crime.

1037
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:48,053
- We're just passing through.
- Yeah. We're with him.

1038
01:08:48,665 --> 01:08:51,133
You wouldn't be heading
over them distant hills...

1039
01:08:51,301 --> 01:08:53,235
...and through the blizzard country?

1040
01:08:53,403 --> 01:08:56,201
If it's the only way
to the forbidden shore, yeah.

1041
01:08:56,372 --> 01:08:57,566
Crikey.

1042
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:01,232
You might come face to face
with an annihilator.

1043
01:09:01,411 --> 01:09:02,435
An alien annihilator?

1044
01:09:02,612 --> 01:09:05,547
Too right. Cut you up
as soon as look at you.

1045
01:09:05,715 --> 01:09:08,741
Waste every living thing in their path.

1046
01:09:08,918 --> 01:09:10,579
Could they be annihilating the fish?

1047
01:09:10,753 --> 01:09:12,345
Every living thing.

1048
01:09:12,522 --> 01:09:14,990
Merciless, mate. Merciless.

1049
01:09:15,158 --> 01:09:17,456
Even if you're a whopping great whale...

1050
01:09:17,627 --> 01:09:20,289
...they drag your sorry carcass ashore...

1051
01:09:20,463 --> 01:09:26,163
...dice you up, melt you down,
and turn you into fun food.

1052
01:09:26,336 --> 01:09:28,600
One day you're a big old whale...

1053
01:09:28,771 --> 01:09:31,069
...next minute...

1054
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,639
...fun food.

1055
01:09:32,809 --> 01:09:34,242
Someone's gotta stop them.

1056
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:36,901
Oh, yeah? What's gonna be
your approach?

1057
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,105
If I could just talk to them.

1058
01:09:39,282 --> 01:09:40,773
Appeal to their better nature.

1059
01:09:40,951 --> 01:09:41,940
Beauty.

1060
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:47,716
When that crafty little trick pays off,
you be sure to let us know, won't you?

1061
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:50,758
All right, Lovelace, let's go.

1062
01:09:52,996 --> 01:09:55,089
See you, Lovelace.

1063
01:09:57,534 --> 01:09:59,968
Your funeral, mate.

1064
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,345
Oh, man!

1065
01:10:51,388 --> 01:10:54,118
- Push tight.
- Okay.

1066
01:11:08,772 --> 01:11:10,933
Come on, guys. Let's do it.

1067
01:11:11,108 --> 01:11:15,010
You can do it. Come on, push!

1068
01:11:59,257 --> 01:12:01,282
What's that noise?

1069
01:12:02,827 --> 01:12:04,021
There's no noise.

1070
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:06,755
- No gasping. No wheezing.
- Where's Lovelace?

1071
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:13,600
Sometimes a brave penguin
will just slip away to die.

1072
01:12:13,771 --> 01:12:15,705
Do you think he went to a happy place?

1073
01:12:15,874 --> 01:12:19,469
- Probably.
- No, no. I think he went this way.

1074
01:12:31,523 --> 01:12:34,014
Come on. Let's go.

1075
01:12:50,608 --> 01:12:52,508
Lovelace!

1076
01:12:53,678 --> 01:12:56,169
Lovelace!

1077
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:04,051
Hello?

1078
01:13:05,456 --> 01:13:06,855
Is there anyone there?

1079
01:13:07,025 --> 01:13:10,620
- No... No need to shout.
- Somebody might hear you.

1080
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:18,030
His feet don't look too good.

1081
01:13:18,202 --> 01:13:20,796
- He rested here.
- Now he's on his belly!

1082
01:13:20,972 --> 01:13:23,532
- No, this way.
- You don't want to know what he did here.

1083
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:25,938
- You're right.
- There he is. Lovelace!

1084
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,409
- All right! Lovelace!
- Lovelace!

1085
01:13:32,183 --> 01:13:33,946
- Oh, look at Lovelace.
- We're here.

1086
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:37,679
- Are you okay?
- Come on, man. Hang in there, buddy.

1087
01:13:38,556 --> 01:13:40,183
What is it?

1088
01:13:40,358 --> 01:13:43,623
Oh, look. There's one for everyone.

1089
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:46,320
Hang in there, Lovelace.
I know they're here somewhere.

1090
01:13:46,497 --> 01:13:49,022
- Why would they leave all this behind?
- I don't know.

1091
01:13:50,034 --> 01:13:51,023
Hey.

1092
01:13:51,202 --> 01:13:53,466
- Tell them we come in peace.
- We come in peace!

1093
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,162
- Lovelace.
- Lovelace.

1094
01:13:55,341 --> 01:13:56,808
- Lovelace.
- Oh, buddy, come on.

1095
01:13:56,976 --> 01:13:59,035
- Are you okay?
- Hang in there, buddy.

1096
01:14:01,647 --> 01:14:04,115
- Oh, that's not good.
- Stay calm.

1097
01:14:04,283 --> 01:14:05,580
- Stay calm.
- That's not good.

1098
01:14:05,751 --> 01:14:08,345
- Okay, don't stay calm!
- Panic!

1099
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,028
Oh, no, no!

1100
01:14:19,064 --> 01:14:22,158
- Oh, they're making us appe-teasers.
- They're appe-teasing us!

1101
01:14:22,334 --> 01:14:24,461
We're all gonna die.

1102
01:14:25,738 --> 01:14:27,603
Whatever you do, stay out of the water!

1103
01:14:27,773 --> 01:14:29,900
- Stay out of the water.
- Don't go in the water!

1104
01:14:30,075 --> 01:14:32,771
Lovelace, don't go in the water!

1105
01:14:38,617 --> 01:14:40,141
Lovelace, hang in there!

1106
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:42,219
Hang in there!

1107
01:14:43,589 --> 01:14:46,581
Get your dirty tongue off him!

1108
01:14:48,994 --> 01:14:50,894
No, no, no!

1109
01:14:51,063 --> 01:14:52,530
Stay out of the water!

1110
01:14:52,698 --> 01:14:54,393
- Mumble!
- Mumble!

1111
01:15:24,663 --> 01:15:29,259
- They playing birdminton?
- No, it's a show. Dinner and a show.

1112
01:15:32,905 --> 01:15:35,465
Lovelace!

1113
01:15:40,979 --> 01:15:42,970
Rejoice!

1114
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:52,584
Lovelace!

1115
01:15:52,758 --> 01:15:54,817
- Help!
- Reach out!

1116
01:15:54,993 --> 01:15:56,824
Thank you, my brother, thank you!

1117
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,672
I wasn't scared! I wasn't scared!

1118
01:16:10,477 --> 01:16:14,413
Oh, my beautiful brother, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you!

1119
01:16:18,585 --> 01:16:21,554
- Go, Lovelace! You the man!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1120
01:16:21,721 --> 01:16:24,189
Enough!

1121
01:16:24,357 --> 01:16:26,450
It's a bad day for you!

1122
01:16:26,626 --> 01:16:28,685
You dealing with Lovelace now!

1123
01:16:28,862 --> 01:16:31,524
- And my man, Mumble, here.
- You tell them, Lovelace.

1124
01:16:31,698 --> 01:16:34,462
Begone, demon fish. Adios.

1125
01:16:35,869 --> 01:16:37,496
That's right.

1126
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:39,433
You hightail it back to your mamas.

1127
01:16:39,739 --> 01:16:41,798
- How did he do that?
- Don't make me come in the water.

1128
01:16:41,975 --> 01:16:43,909
I'll come after your sons and daughters.

1129
01:16:44,077 --> 01:16:46,068
I'm gonna give you the bad eye.

1130
01:17:40,366 --> 01:17:41,697
A whole bunch of them.

1131
01:17:41,868 --> 01:17:44,496
They gonna rule the world.

1132
01:17:44,671 --> 01:17:45,660
It's gotta be them.

1133
01:17:45,839 --> 01:17:49,104
- If it is, I don't wanna know about it.
- They don't even know we exist.

1134
01:17:49,275 --> 01:17:50,606
Let me tell something to you.

1135
01:17:50,777 --> 01:17:53,769
This is the end of the road. It's over.

1136
01:17:53,947 --> 01:17:56,848
You did everything penguinly possible.

1137
01:17:57,016 --> 01:17:59,484
- You found the aliens.
- We gonna testify to that.

1138
01:17:59,652 --> 01:18:03,019
We'll tell your whole laughing-boy nation
they were dead wrong about you.

1139
01:18:03,189 --> 01:18:04,986
Now, let's all go back home. Right now.

1140
01:18:05,158 --> 01:18:06,523
Right on.

1141
01:18:06,693 --> 01:18:08,285
- Could I ask a favor of you?
- Sure.

1142
01:18:08,461 --> 01:18:11,022
- What kind of favor?
- Could you make sure Gloria's okay?

1143
01:18:11,198 --> 01:18:12,563
- And my ma.
- What?

1144
01:18:12,733 --> 01:18:14,325
And if you see Pa...

1145
01:18:14,501 --> 01:18:17,368
...tell him I tried.

1146
01:18:17,538 --> 01:18:19,028
Okay, what you talking about?

1147
01:18:19,206 --> 01:18:20,969
I'm gonna stop them taking our fish.

1148
01:18:21,141 --> 01:18:22,699
How you gonna do that, Mumble?

1149
01:18:25,079 --> 01:18:28,139
Adios, amigos!

1150
01:18:28,482 --> 01:18:29,972
Amigo! He did it.

1151
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:54,564
You believe that?

1152
01:18:54,742 --> 01:18:58,303
How we gonna tell his mama
he bring us all this way just to kill himself?

1153
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:01,243
No. He didn't. Look.

1154
01:19:02,082 --> 01:19:03,845
He loco maniac.

1155
01:19:04,018 --> 01:19:06,953
First ever flying flipper bird.

1156
01:19:07,121 --> 01:19:09,282
How tall you think that tall boy was?

1157
01:19:09,456 --> 01:19:12,619
Who could say? Taller than anyone.

1158
01:19:12,793 --> 01:19:16,729
Hey, it's me, Lovelace...

1159
01:19:16,897 --> 01:19:19,297
...formerly known as "guru."

1160
01:19:19,466 --> 01:19:22,458
I'm gonna be telling your story,
Happy Feet...

1161
01:19:22,636 --> 01:19:26,504
...long after you dead and gone!

1162
01:19:43,524 --> 01:19:45,788
Hey! Hey!

1163
01:20:35,944 --> 01:20:38,640
<i>Enraged by their indifference...</i>

1164
01:20:38,813 --> 01:20:44,149
<i>... he followed them long after</i>
<i>they were gone from his sight.</i>

1165
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:50,553
<i>He ventured further</i>
<i>than any of us had gone before...</i>

1166
01:20:50,725 --> 01:20:54,559
<i>... beyond all hope of return.</i>

1167
01:20:55,497 --> 01:20:57,931
<i>Swept up by the great currents...</i>

1168
01:20:58,099 --> 01:21:02,763
<i>... he was carried endlessly</i>
<i>across vast oceans...</i>

1169
01:21:02,937 --> 01:21:06,634
<i>... to worlds unknown.</i>

1170
01:22:02,931 --> 01:22:05,695
Excuse me. What is this place?

1171
01:22:05,867 --> 01:22:08,859
You're in heaven, Dave. Penguin heaven.

1172
01:22:09,037 --> 01:22:11,028
Is it anywhere near Emperor Land?

1173
01:22:11,206 --> 01:22:14,004
It's wherever you want it to be.

1174
01:22:14,843 --> 01:22:18,870
Try the water, Dave. It's really real.

1175
01:22:34,964 --> 01:22:39,333
<i>I heard tell,</i>
<i>when he finally saw aliens up close...</i>

1176
01:22:39,502 --> 01:22:43,700
<i>... they were just as the skua</i>
<i>had described.</i>

1177
01:22:43,873 --> 01:22:46,501
Excuse me. Why are you taking our fish?

1178
01:22:46,675 --> 01:22:51,977
<i>Big, ugly penguins without feathers</i>
<i>on their fat, flabby faces.</i>

1179
01:22:52,148 --> 01:22:57,882
Why are you taking our fish?
You're kind of killing us out there.

1180
01:23:00,256 --> 01:23:02,349
No! No, wait!

1181
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:13,935
Oh, my.

1182
01:23:15,004 --> 01:23:19,168
Hello. Hello from Emperor Land.
Good afternoon.

1183
01:23:19,341 --> 01:23:21,104
Why are you taking our fish?

1184
01:23:21,277 --> 01:23:25,714
I'm sure you don't mean to,
but you're causing an awful lot of grief.

1185
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:30,708
Am I not making myself clear?
I'm speaking plain penguin.

1186
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:35,181
Penguin! Don't you understand?
You're stealing our fish.

1187
01:23:39,461 --> 01:23:42,191
Oh, please, anyone, talk to me!

1188
01:23:42,364 --> 01:23:44,594
For pity's sake, you're stealing our F-l-S...

1189
01:23:49,371 --> 01:23:54,138
<i>After three days, he would lose his voice.</i>

1190
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:56,744
<i>After three months...</i>

1191
01:23:58,714 --> 01:24:02,844
<i>... he would all but lose his mind.</i>

1192
01:24:15,264 --> 01:24:18,233
So you found the fish, baby.

1193
01:24:19,335 --> 01:24:20,996
Ma?

1194
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:22,467
- Hi, sweetie.
- Ma.

1195
01:24:22,638 --> 01:24:27,041
Fluffy, no matter what they say or do,
we never stopped believing in you.

1196
01:24:27,209 --> 01:24:29,302
So you'll be back soon, right?

1197
01:24:29,478 --> 01:24:31,105
Hey, come on. Let him eat.

1198
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,272
Go ahead, Dave. Don't mind us.

1199
01:24:33,783 --> 01:24:35,250
But there's plenty for everyone.

1200
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:37,716
It's okay, sugar. We can wait.

1201
01:24:37,887 --> 01:24:39,718
No, no, Ma! Ma!

1202
01:24:39,889 --> 01:24:43,290
There's lots here. Ma!

1203
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:48,822
Ma!

1204
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:11,735
- Kids, you gotta see this.
- He's on now.

1205
01:27:33,497 --> 01:27:35,863
Hey! Hello!

1206
01:27:38,302 --> 01:27:40,862
- Isn't that the fellow with the wacky feet?
- Looks like.

1207
01:27:41,038 --> 01:27:43,336
- What was his name?
- I thought he was dead.

1208
01:27:43,507 --> 01:27:44,906
- Everybody...
- Apparently not.

1209
01:27:45,075 --> 01:27:48,010
Everybody, listen up! I've got big news.

1210
01:27:48,345 --> 01:27:50,336
I know who's taking the fish!

1211
01:27:50,514 --> 01:27:52,982
- Yeah, and they took his brain.
- It's the aliens.

1212
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:55,414
- I made contact with them.
- The lunatic is back.

1213
01:27:55,586 --> 01:27:57,577
The aliens are taking our fish.

1214
01:27:57,755 --> 01:27:59,814
Someone ought to fetch
Noah and the elders.

1215
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:01,287
Hey, you.

1216
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:03,417
Gloria.

1217
01:28:03,594 --> 01:28:05,687
Kind of weird, seeing you again.

1218
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:07,186
Yeah.

1219
01:28:07,364 --> 01:28:09,730
- Everything cool here, baby?
- You remember Seymour.

1220
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,197
Yeah. Hi, Seymour.

1221
01:28:11,368 --> 01:28:12,858
Yeah.

1222
01:28:14,171 --> 01:28:15,900
So which one is yours?

1223
01:28:17,141 --> 01:28:18,403
All of them.

1224
01:28:20,778 --> 01:28:24,908
This is our singing class.
He teaches rhythm. I teach the blues.

1225
01:28:25,082 --> 01:28:27,676
- So you're not...?
- I guess I never heard the right song.

1226
01:28:27,852 --> 01:28:30,980
That's great! I didn't mean...

1227
01:28:31,322 --> 01:28:32,914
I found out who's taking the fish.

1228
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:35,217
They're big and kind of ugly,
but, Gloria...

1229
01:28:35,392 --> 01:28:37,690
...the things they can do.
They're coming here.

1230
01:28:37,862 --> 01:28:38,988
Oh, is that so?

1231
01:28:39,163 --> 01:28:41,563
They'll be here soon.
I think they wanna help us.

1232
01:28:41,732 --> 01:28:43,461
So now you speak with them?

1233
01:28:43,634 --> 01:28:46,832
Well, they don't speak penguin,
but they seem to respond to this.

1234
01:28:47,005 --> 01:28:49,064
- What's he doing?
- You gotta be kidding me.

1235
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:52,267
I suggest we all do it.
It really gets their attention.

1236
01:28:52,444 --> 01:28:53,775
And why would it do that?

1237
01:28:53,945 --> 01:28:56,846
Beats me, but it works.

1238
01:28:57,015 --> 01:28:59,882
- Hey, it's the hippity-hopper.
- Freaky feet!

1239
01:29:00,051 --> 01:29:01,040
Boys, boys...

1240
01:29:01,219 --> 01:29:02,208
- Fluffy.
- Tall guy.

1241
01:29:02,387 --> 01:29:04,378
- Stretch!
- Amigo!

1242
01:29:07,993 --> 01:29:10,860
So you dare come back?

1243
01:29:11,162 --> 01:29:13,756
He says he's found aliens
and they're taking our fish.

1244
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:16,457
He says that they're coming
and we all have to do this.

1245
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:21,463
There be no such thing as aliens!

1246
01:29:23,575 --> 01:29:26,305
Mumble, turn around.

1247
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:30,937
It's a disease.

1248
01:29:31,349 --> 01:29:33,044
Is that from them?

1249
01:29:33,752 --> 01:29:37,916
Yeah. But don't be afraid.
I think it's a way to find me, that's all.

1250
01:29:38,089 --> 01:29:41,786
You led them here?
You turned them on your own kind?

1251
01:29:42,594 --> 01:29:46,496
Wait a second, you just said
there's no such thing as aliens.

1252
01:29:48,934 --> 01:29:51,061
Well, there's not.

1253
01:29:51,236 --> 01:29:54,865
But if there were, only a traitorous fool
would bring them here.

1254
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,132
But they have to come.

1255
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:59,277
They're the ones taking our fish.
They can do something about it.

1256
01:29:59,444 --> 01:30:02,936
None but the Great 'Guin
has the power to give and take away.

1257
01:30:03,114 --> 01:30:07,574
The Great 'Guin didn't put things
out of whack, the aliens did.

1258
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:12,089
A fool returns this day
to mock our suffering.

1259
01:30:12,257 --> 01:30:16,387
We are starving
and he wants us to hippity-hop.

1260
01:30:16,561 --> 01:30:19,496
So do we hold fast to our ways...

1261
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:24,363
...or do we bend to the fetid fantasies
of a dancing fool?

1262
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,874
Say, how does that feet thing go again?

1263
01:30:36,047 --> 01:30:37,605
Yeah, show us, Mumble.

1264
01:30:38,984 --> 01:30:41,043
Oh, it's really quite easy.

1265
01:30:41,219 --> 01:30:42,846
No, no!

1266
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:44,352
No, you must resist!

1267
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:46,885
That's right.

1268
01:30:47,258 --> 01:30:50,625
- Pointless nonsense.
- Resist! Stand your ground!

1269
01:30:50,795 --> 01:30:54,129
Stand your ground against this folly!

1270
01:30:59,905 --> 01:31:02,965
Raise your voices, brothers.

1271
01:31:03,142 --> 01:31:06,441
Cry out in defiance of this jiggity-joggity!

1272
01:31:06,612 --> 01:31:08,739
Show me what you got.

1273
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,279
You got it.

1274
01:31:17,823 --> 01:31:19,256
Come on.

1275
01:31:19,425 --> 01:31:20,756
Work, work it.

1276
01:31:20,926 --> 01:31:24,020
Yes, yes! Call on the wisdoms!

1277
01:31:24,196 --> 01:31:25,925
Let the world tremble!

1278
01:31:26,365 --> 01:31:28,230
For when all others leave...

1279
01:31:28,401 --> 01:31:30,266
...we remain!

1280
01:31:32,004 --> 01:31:33,631
Mumble! Mumble!

1281
01:31:33,806 --> 01:31:36,604
Mama? Amigos.

1282
01:31:37,977 --> 01:31:40,810
- Oh, Mama.
- Oh, my boy.

1283
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:43,574
- My gorgeous boy.
- Oh, Mama.

1284
01:31:43,749 --> 01:31:45,876
- Look at him.
- You're so dazzling.

1285
01:31:46,052 --> 01:31:48,919
- Oh, Fluffy.
- We waited and waited for you.

1286
01:31:49,088 --> 01:31:51,921
- Oh, yeah.
- Where's Pa?

1287
01:31:52,091 --> 01:31:54,355
Believe me. You don't wanna see
your deadbeat dad.

1288
01:31:54,527 --> 01:31:56,586
- Your pa is sort of...
- What?

1289
01:31:56,762 --> 01:31:59,060
Come on, I'll show you.

1290
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:10,238
Memphis?

1291
01:32:11,277 --> 01:32:12,710
Memphis?

1292
01:32:12,878 --> 01:32:14,368
Pa?

1293
01:32:18,284 --> 01:32:19,911
Mumble?

1294
01:32:20,086 --> 01:32:22,077
Is it truly you?

1295
01:32:22,254 --> 01:32:24,586
Every last bit of me, Pa.

1296
01:32:28,761 --> 01:32:30,592
I thought...

1297
01:32:34,734 --> 01:32:36,224
Pa?

1298
01:32:39,839 --> 01:32:42,239
There ain't been one day...

1299
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:48,840
...not one day, that I done right by you.

1300
01:32:53,185 --> 01:32:55,210
Oh, Pa.

1301
01:32:55,387 --> 01:32:57,252
Dance for him, Daddy.

1302
01:32:57,423 --> 01:32:59,414
Dance with your boy.

1303
01:33:02,763 --> 01:33:05,163
You'll have to forgive me.

1304
01:33:05,966 --> 01:33:09,026
The music's gone clean out of me.

1305
01:33:10,904 --> 01:33:12,496
No, it hasn't.

1306
01:33:12,672 --> 01:33:16,472
It's just like singing with your body.

1307
01:33:16,643 --> 01:33:18,668
Come on, baby. We can do it.

1308
01:33:18,845 --> 01:33:20,403
Oh, Mama.

1309
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:24,949
It's just one big old foot after the other.

1310
01:33:30,357 --> 01:33:31,346
That's it.

1311
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,191
Yeah.

1312
01:33:36,563 --> 01:33:39,396
- Yeah, see?
- Well, that feels good.

1313
01:33:44,638 --> 01:33:48,074
<i>You don't have to be beautiful</i>

1314
01:33:48,508 --> 01:33:49,497
Yeah, Memphis.

1315
01:33:49,743 --> 01:33:51,370
<i>To turn me on</i>

1316
01:33:51,845 --> 01:33:52,834
Daddy.

1317
01:33:53,013 --> 01:33:57,040
<i>I just need your body, baby</i>

1318
01:33:57,217 --> 01:33:59,708
<i>From dusk till dawn</i>

1319
01:34:00,921 --> 01:34:04,652
<i>You don't have to be rich to be my girl</i>

1320
01:34:04,825 --> 01:34:08,818
<i>You don't have to be cool</i>
<i>To rule my world</i>

1321
01:34:08,951 --> 01:34:12,853
<i>Ain't no particular song</i>
<i>I'm more compatible with</i>

1322
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:17,686
<i>I just want your extra time and your...</i>

1323
01:34:38,014 --> 01:34:41,040
Holy flock!

1324
01:35:06,442 --> 01:35:08,876
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

1325
01:35:45,548 --> 01:35:47,914
I think you better dance now.

1326
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:43,938
First, there was just one.
Now there's thousands.

1327
01:36:44,106 --> 01:36:46,802
- Are they trying to tell us something?
- What's the problem?

1328
01:36:46,976 --> 01:36:49,774
- We're messing with their food chain.
- We've gotta do something.

1329
01:36:49,946 --> 01:36:53,643
- We suggest a ban on all marine harvesting.
- Too much money. Too many jobs.

1330
01:36:55,551 --> 01:36:57,712
Why should we do anything at all?

1331
01:37:03,426 --> 01:37:06,793
They're just a bunch of flightless birds
at the bottom of the world.

1332
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,632
I don't wanna live in a world
without penguins.

1333
01:37:13,803 --> 01:37:15,168
What are we gonna do about it?

1334
01:37:15,338 --> 01:37:16,999
Bang up the sign "No Fishing."

1335
01:37:18,774 --> 01:37:22,175
Is equal to the love...

1336
01:37:22,345 --> 01:37:23,744
...you make.

1337
01:37:27,817 --> 01:37:31,981
<i>Oh, baby. Right on.</i>

1338
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:49,631
<i>Looking back on when I</i>
<i>Was a little nappy-headed boy</i>

1339
01:37:52,475 --> 01:37:53,942
<i>It's like a jungle sometimes</i>

1340
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:56,305
<i>It makes me wonder</i>
<i>How I keep from going under</i>

1341
01:37:58,247 --> 01:37:59,714
Bring it on! Go ahead!

1342
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:04,576
<i>Even though we sometimes</i>
<i>Would not get a thing</i>

1343
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:08,622
<i>We were happy with</i>
<i>The joy the day would bring</i>

1344
01:38:08,791 --> 01:38:11,954
<i>I wish those days</i>
<i>Would come back once more</i>

1345
01:38:12,128 --> 01:38:16,326
<i>Come back those days, those days</i>
<i>Come back, don't go</i>

1346
01:38:16,732 --> 01:38:19,394
Come here, babe. Come on back.

1347
01:38:19,568 --> 01:38:20,557
<i>Come on back</i>

1348
01:38:20,736 --> 01:38:22,363
<i>- Come on back</i>
<i>- Come on back</i>

1349
01:38:22,538 --> 01:38:25,029
<i>- Come on back</i>
<i>- Come on back</i>

1350
01:38:25,207 --> 01:38:27,402
<i>I love them, I love them</i>

1351
01:38:27,576 --> 01:38:28,736
<i>I love them, I love them</i>

1352
01:38:33,549 --> 01:38:36,677
<i>Those days, those days</i>
<i>Those days, those days</i>

1353
01:38:36,852 --> 01:38:42,347
