1
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,160
London - England

1
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:45,480
- Fuck.
- It's not there.

2
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:49,321
- It's in the kitchen where you left it.
- How did you get out?

3
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:54,217
You have a nice family.

4
00:03:55,657 --> 00:04:01,033
They are fine.
Alive, asleep...

5
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:04,096
Are you gonna kill me?

6
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:07,466
If I was gonna kill you, I would have done it when
you walked to your car this morning.

7
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:10,442
And be gone by the time your
body hit the sidewalk.

8
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:13,419
- Then why are you here?
- To talk.

9
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:17,547
But Mike, if you make me kill you
you will not go alone.

10
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:19,755
Sit.

11
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:36,364
- Are you a good man, Inspector?.
- I think.

12
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,397
- And yet you've killed men.
- Yes.

13
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:42,221
I'm gonna ask you a question.

14
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:45,677
How you answer it,
will determin how this night ends.

15
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:50,574
How does a good man decide
when to kill?

16
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:54,510
The man you have been 
chasing is a killer.

17
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:59,118
SHANTY TOWN
NIGERIA

18
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:03,535
Rumor has it that he is working for a group
known only as "The Organisation".

19
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:07,951
So secret no one knows it exists.
Takes no signs.

20
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:09,967
Yet it has ties to every government.

21
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:14,768
It's sole purpose is the training and 
conditioning of professional killers.

22
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:18,128
These men are selected at birth.

23
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:22,640
Rejects, Orfans.
All of them, unwanted and disposible.

24
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:26,193
They are made experts in every
aspect of combat.

25
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:29,841
And programmed for one purpose:
To Kill.

26
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:36,081
The man you have been chasing the last years, 
Inspector,is the very best of them.

27
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:37,617
Put him there.

28
00:05:47,122 --> 00:05:51,827
You should not have stolen from me, Brother.
Now you must pay.

29
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:02,003
What happened to his voice?
- A man...

30
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,324
What did you do to his voice?
- Nothing, Ovey.

31
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:16,597
You didn't find him?
- No a contractor, an american.

32
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:31,382
Run!.

33
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,730
HEADQUARTER NIGERIAN EMBASSY
NIGERIA

34
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:46,071
- We have all heard your theories.
- This is not a theory. This is our guy.

35
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,567
No motif, no ferencic evidence,
no witnesses.

36
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:50,727
He's a...
He's a ghost.

37
00:06:50,823 --> 00:06:55,144
- And how long have you been chasing this "ghost"?
- Three years.

38
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,120
Well, thank goodness you have Interpol
to finance your persistance, huh?

39
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:01,908
You see, Inspector.
It is unlike any in the third world,

40
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,929
we attempt competent 
police work here.

41
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:07,865
And it is our belief that Juan Abir
was killed by his own brother.

42
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:13,049
So he choked dow a pound of C4
and knocked on his door.

43
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:16,026
- Probably.
- General...

44
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:19,002
This man truly is the best at what he does.

45
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:23,034
He is likely responsible for over
one hundred deaths.

46
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,954
Let me show you what I mean.

47
00:07:26,106 --> 00:07:28,795
This is Ove.

48
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:39,259
And these are just the ones we know about.
Are you beginning to get the picture?

49
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:06,910
They might kill you for that?
For what you are doing to that whisky?

50
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:09,886
You are brutalising it with ice.

51
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:21,695
I'm sorry. Aftermath of my pretencious 
ex-husband, I'm afraid.

52
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:27,647
I'm June.
And you are?

53
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:36,384
- This is where you tell me your name.
- Excuse me.

54
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:28,521
Afrika-job complete.
The money has been wired to your account.

55
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:29,760
Nice work.

56
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:35,434
Regrettably the next target date has been
moved up, at the client's request.

57
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,410
The client wishes it to be public.

58
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:42,827
I have planned something more...
Subtle.

59
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:44,747
I've made preperations.

60
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:52,139
It comes from the russian president, Mikhail Belikov,
recent political shift is in direct conflict with our client's interests

61
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:57,420
and threatens the control of the russian government.
The client needs it to be public.

62
00:10:57,516 --> 00:11:00,396
Do you accept the new parameters?

63
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,445
- Yes.
- We appreciate you breaking your normal protocol.

64
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,421
The specifics are being uploaded.

65
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:17,682
I'm sorry. In light of your new political dispositions,
do you think that "hardliners" will continue

66
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,755
- to support you to the election?
- All that needs to be...

67
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,189
CENTRAL STATION
ST. PETERSBURG

68
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:13,943
We have a problem.
There was a witness at St. Petersburg.

69
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:18,167
- How reliable are your souces?
- Impercable, as always.

70
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:23,160
Interpol has arranged a pick-up.
Will you intercept?.

71
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:26,136
Yes.
- Uploading data.

5
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
How much?

73
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:25,277
PULKOVO AIRPORT
ST. PETERSBURG

74
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:36,126
Can't be sure.
He never works again so quickly.

75
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:40,926
But the russians say that Belikov was graised
by a single bullet from 4 km away.

76
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:43,806
But it definately sounds like him.

77
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:47,647
What bothers me, 
is that he missed.

78
00:14:48,703 --> 00:14:55,231
Yes sir, I know what this investigation 
has cost. I understand...

79
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,107
I just need a little more time.
- You have to see this.

80
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,608
Sorry sir, I'm gonna have to call you back.

81
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:07,040
Ok, he shoots a bodyguard to get a clean
shot at Belikov.

82
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:09,724
Yet he splits these two civilians
by a couple of inches.

83
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,937
Keep watching. Keep an eye on the bodyguard.

84
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:15,201
See that?
- Back it up again.

85
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:21,154
That is an awful lot of arterial spray for a miss.
- You have a call.

86
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,186
This is Whittier.
They found him?

87
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,450
Concierge? Where?

88
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:34,691
A picture?
Where the hell did they get a picture?

89
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:37,859
Alright I'm on my way.

90
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:41,219
They found him.

91
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:45,636
Contact the russian secret police in St. Petersburg
and tell them that Interpol has juristiction.

92
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:49,668
We have to keep him under survelliance only.
No one moves until we get there. Noone!

93
00:15:57,061 --> 00:16:01,189
Was the target not at the location?
- The girl was there, but she was no witness.

94
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:02,917
She had never seen me before.

95
00:16:03,013 --> 00:16:08,389
We will be unable to transfer payment for the
given assignment as the task was not completed.

96
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:12,806
No he took a direct hit through the nasal cab.
I watched it myself.

97
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:14,342
Please wait.

98
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:16,646

BELIKOV LIVES

100
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,935
Who was the client?

101
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:31,806
Answer me!.

102
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:34,696
Who ordered the hit on Belikov?

103
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:43,336
If you set me up...
I will find you and burn that building to the ground.

104
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:06,282
Mike Whittier, Interpol.
What's the status on my suspect?

105
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:11,275
I was told you were coming, Inspector .
I am Captain Gudnayev, St. Petersburg Militia.

106
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,883
Make yourself comfortable.
My men are almost in position.

107
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:19,723
In position for what?
- We have been informed that the suspect intends to flee.

108
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,700
My orders are to...
- Orders? Orders from who?

109
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:24,332
Interpol has juristiction here.

110
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:26,540
The police is responsible for the
extraction.

111
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:29,900
Kapitein Gudnayev is not directing this operation
I'm afraid, I am.

112
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:34,221
Chiefagent Yuri Marklov of the FSP.
- The FSP?

113
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:37,197
Why the hell is the russian secret police
involved in this?.

114
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:44,013
We're going in...
- Captain, I advise you to get your men out of there.

115
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:45,636
You have no idea who you are dealing with.

116
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:48,526
I assure you, Inspector, these men are cuite cabable
of handling this situation.

117
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:51,694
Shoot on sight.

118
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:55,630
Do not give that order.

119
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:16,848
47, It's Diana.
I can get retired for contacting you directly.

120
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:21,456
The client was Belikov.

121
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:25,585
Your location has been compromised.

122
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,040
Stay here. Cover the elevator.
Call me on my cell and tell me were it stops.

123
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:28,859
I've got five dead in the elevator.
None of them our boy.

124
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:32,315
He's on the third floor.
So he must be heading for the southern shaft.

125
00:20:37,884 --> 00:20:39,324
Freese.

126
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:48,349
Get down.
- Stay there.

127
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:51,325
Get down!.
- Stay up.

128
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:12,543
We had him.

129
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:29,920
How many men did you lose?
- Sixteen.

130
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,184
No, no, no... Wait... Don't touch that!.

131
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:39,905
Were do you get your fucking licence?
- I need the room, Captain.

132
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:43,366
Where does he get all this stuff?
- Can you make it work?

133
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,838
Probably.
Why?

134
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:59,015
I have been loking for you, Inspector.
I think we started off on the wrong foot.

135
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:07,176
Who informed you on the whereabouts of My guy?
- I think it's time we had a chat, You and I.

136
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:24,169
This assassin, my colleague tells me
you believe him to be in freelance.

137
00:23:24,265 --> 00:23:29,450
Your associates tell you that?
- You do not believe he is connected to the CIA?

138
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:33,674
Why do you ask?
- No reason, it just seems a bit naïve.

139
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:37,322
Well, it's a theory.
- Yes, a theory.

140
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:45,291
But a theory shared by Moskow.
In accordance with article 1764.3 of the EU-charter

141
00:23:45,387 --> 00:23:52,396
Any states matter that deals directly with
intelligence will be the soul juristiction of the hosts country.

142
00:23:52,492 --> 00:23:55,948
Ah, the light bulb comes on,
give me a minute, must be the jetlag.

143
00:23:56,044 --> 00:23:58,924
You are telling me to fuck off.

144
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,900
Of course not.
You are a good man, Michael.

145
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:07,757
One of Interpols best.
But leave this intelligence work to the FSP.

146
00:24:12,173 --> 00:24:14,093
And Belikov?

147
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:25,614
I'm sorry?
- You know, There are two things wrong with this photograph.

148
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,874
For one, the fotage has been tampered with.
Someone inserted that civilian to cover up

149
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:31,567
what actually happened.

150
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:37,807
And the sencond thing?
My Boy doesn't miss.

151
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:19,955
Delivery.
- You are supposed to leave it at the desk.

152
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,931
Mr Belikov sent them.

153
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,724
Make a sound and I'll end your life.
Do you understand?

154
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,700
Who else is inside?

155
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:39,541
I know you. From the street earlier today.
- You are coming with me.

156
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:42,517
No, I can't.
- OK!.

157
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,670
Where are you taking me?
- Somewhere safe.

158
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,934
Get in.
- Fuck You, I'm not getting in there.

159
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:29,945
Are you going to kill me?

160
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:42,810
I am going to ask you some questions.
Before today on the street, had you ever seen me?

161
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:45,306
Why were you there?

162
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:48,282
My boyfriend... He told me to meet his
driver on the corner.

163
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:50,774
Belikov?
How?

164
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:55,387
After I put a bullit through his head.
How was he able to give that speech this afternoon?

165
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:00,283
Then you have no use to me.

166
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:04,700
Wait.
There is something.

167
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:09,788
Dobbles. Mikail has dobbles.
- The man I shot was not an imposter,

168
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:13,532
Belikov is dead.

169
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:30,910
Why did you tatoo your face?

170
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:33,886
Because it's the only place I knew Belikov
wouldn't hit.

171
00:27:40,318 --> 00:27:42,143
Tell me about Udre Belicoff.

172
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:47,999
Mikhails broder?
He runs slave girls, drugs and weapons.

173
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:53,376
Both the CIA and the FSP want him dead.
Mikhail has been protecting him.

174
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,352
Get up, You're coming with me.

175
00:27:56,448 --> 00:27:59,328
I can't. He'll kill me if he found out I left
the appartment.

176
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:02,391
Belikov hired me to kill you
and used you to set me up.

177
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,281
The dead man in the trunck was your driver.

178
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:12,769
He was gonna use him on You.
You're as good as dead without me.

179
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:17,186
Where are we going?

180
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:21,698
I'm gonna finish the job I
was hired to do.

181
00:28:21,794 --> 00:28:23,426
Find out who's behind this.

182
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:41,283
I need to talk to you.
- I need coffee. Follow me.

183
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:49,869
We have three roadblocks. Here, here and here.
We completely shot down international airports.

184
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,449
All of our security has been tripled.
He cannot get out of the city.

185
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,693
What about the train stations?

186
00:28:54,694 --> 00:28:56,267
Temporarely closed.

187
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:57,575
And St. Petersburg station?.

188
00:28:57,576 --> 00:29:00,100
There are no trains leaving Russia
from this station.

189
00:29:00,135 --> 00:29:02,971
Only trains headed for Argentirer.

190
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:09,585
What makes you think he'll go further into Russia?
- Because I know him better than anyone.

191
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:15,441
Thanks for the coffee.

192
00:29:29,938 --> 00:29:31,859
Go to the last platform and wait.

193
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,411
Why?
- Now.

194
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:01,045
Jenkins, anything?
- Nothing.

195
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:02,581
Stay sharp.

196
00:30:05,173 --> 00:30:10,070
I don't know, sir. It seems odd for him to come here.
- Trust me, this is were he'll be.

197
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:50,297
Jenkins, bench.
- I've got him, boss.

198
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:24,092
Still on him, Boss.
Platform 9.

199
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:46,275
Getting slow?

200
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:51,171
Tell me why.

201
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:54,531
Why is there a hit on me?

202
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,540
Stay here.

203
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:24,203
Let him die with a little dignity.

204
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,474
You think it's done.
It's just beginning.

205
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:48,891
I told you to wait.
- I know.

206
00:37:50,332 --> 00:37:51,868
I'm sorry.

207
00:38:04,445 --> 00:38:05,885
I know.

208
00:38:26,143 --> 00:38:28,063
Freese.

209
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:37,760
You are the one who has been tracking me.

210
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,824
You need a hostage.
Take me.

211
00:38:46,112 --> 00:38:50,913
Come on. He hasn't seen
your face, he doesn't have to die.

212
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:53,409
Take me instead.

213
00:39:14,627 --> 00:39:18,371
Please...
Stop.

214
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,684
She saved your life.

215
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,982
He said your ribs are broken.
- I'm lucky.

216
00:40:02,054 --> 00:40:05,607
You seem awfully calm considering...
- Your assassin is dead.

217
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:10,887
Why are you covering this up?
You know that's not our killer.

218
00:40:10,983 --> 00:40:15,208
I told you before, Inspector.
This is no longer your affair.

219
00:40:15,304 --> 00:40:19,720
There are to ways in which we can proceed:
One, my men will accompany you to a hospital

220
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:23,656
and when you and your associate are able to travel,
they will escort you to the airport.

221
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:27,785
Then I will write a report ecxtoling
Interpol for it's help.

222
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:32,201
Medals will probably be along.
Or I can report your incompetance.

223
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:35,081
and disregard for my nation's laws
to your superior.

224
00:40:35,177 --> 00:40:41,706
It will undoubtably find its way to the state procecutor in Moscow.
So, how do you think we should proceed?

225
00:40:47,562 --> 00:40:51,979
How about... Go fuck yourself?

226
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,484
Ik heb er genoeg van, teringlijer.
Hoe wist je dat ik genoeg zuurstof had?

227
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,819
Don't be dramatic.
- Dramatic?

228
00:41:14,828 --> 00:41:17,608
I got rid of the body.
- I was in there for hours.

229
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:19,725
I brought you breakfast.

230
00:41:45,743 --> 00:41:50,351
I think if I wasn't so mad at you.
- Look at me.

231
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:00,528
Back at the station you interfered.
I'm sorry. I cannot allow that.

232
00:42:02,544 --> 00:42:04,465
I swear I'll...
- Stop talking.

233
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:12,145
If you are looking for a reason not
to kill me, I have none.

234
00:42:14,161 --> 00:42:16,946
I'm a hore by choice.

235
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:19,922
Bennic owns me.

236
00:42:20,018 --> 00:42:24,818
Would you like to know how much he paid for me?
Three hundred... American.

237
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:32,307
I've tried to escape...
The last time...

238
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:49,108
It is a strange thing to wish to die.

239
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:59,093
So are you...
going to kill me?

240
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:03,029
No.

241
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,734
You don't wanna fuck me
and you don't wanna kill me.

242
00:43:08,598 --> 00:43:11,190
I've never felt so much indifference
in my entire life.

243
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:19,159
If you ever again interfer with me like that...
- I won't.

244
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:22,135
Are we clear?
- Yeah.

245
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,223
Eat your sandwich.
I need some sleep.

246
00:43:31,928 --> 00:43:36,920
You know...
- Nika, stop talking or I'll put you back in the trunck.

247
00:43:45,465 --> 00:43:48,633
FSB AGENCY
ST. PETERSBURG

9
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Wait outside

10
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,700
Are we on a secure line?

11
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,800
Yes comrade

12
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,800
I heard you lost him at the station again

13
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,800
If you're trying to make me nervous
Comrade it's clearly working

14
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Just keep it low profile while 
we track him down

15
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Don't appear in public
and he won't be able to reach you

16
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Comrade Yuri, all of those bodies you buried
and yet a single man eludes you

17
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The operation will not be a success
until he and that whore are dead!

18
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
They are the only ones who can ruin all of this!

19
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Moscow - Russia


267
00:46:04,004 --> 00:46:05,444
For you.

268
00:46:09,573 --> 00:46:12,645
After all these years I'd think
you would trust me a little more than this.

269
00:46:12,741 --> 00:46:15,621
Tell me what you know.
- Officially, nothing.

270
00:46:16,677 --> 00:46:20,518
Unofficially it appears that your employers has
thrown you to the wolves.

271
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:25,126
Why?
- Apparently, Belikovs political stands and refusal to

272
00:46:25,222 --> 00:46:28,102
cooperate with the hardliners,
has upset a lot of people.

273
00:46:28,112 --> 00:46:30,109
So the order to replaced him
with one of their own.

274
00:46:30,118 --> 00:46:33,479
You and your friend here are the
only ones that know Belikov's a dubble.

275
00:46:33,575 --> 00:46:38,759
What's the CIA's position?
- The company usually likes to be on the side of whoever wins.

276
00:46:38,855 --> 00:46:41,159
Take the envelope from the girl.

277
00:46:46,728 --> 00:46:49,704
Udre Belicoff.
Mikhails younger brother.

278
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,872
Rumour is, you'd like him to disappear.
- That is the rumour.

279
00:46:52,968 --> 00:46:56,329
I'd like to help.
- How's killing Udre Belikov gonna help you?

280
00:46:56,425 --> 00:46:57,865
Let me worry about that.

281
00:46:57,961 --> 00:47:01,417
Oh, that might be worth something.
What do you want for your troubles?

282
00:47:01,513 --> 00:47:02,953
A small favour.

283
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:12,554
This is a small favour? I don't think I can do this.
Not in your timeframe.

284
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,090
Keep reading.

285
00:47:15,434 --> 00:47:20,139
Tell me this isn't what I think it is.
- OK, it's not what you think it is.

286
00:47:20,235 --> 00:47:23,883
But I'd think the last thing you want, is
for me to get arrested with that file.

287
00:47:29,739 --> 00:47:30,978
I'll try.

288
00:47:30,987 --> 00:47:33,868
Thank you.
- Yeah, Your welcome.

289
00:47:33,964 --> 00:47:37,900
We know Udre has been planning something
with a Russian armsdealer named Price.

290
00:47:37,996 --> 00:47:40,300
The two have never met.
That's your way in.

291
00:47:40,396 --> 00:47:43,276
Intercept Price,
and you got a shot at Udre.

292
00:47:43,372 --> 00:47:47,981
I'll get you his file.
They're meeting in Istanbul in two days.

293
00:48:06,414 --> 00:48:09,295
Good morning.
Have you slept at all?

294
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:17,167
You know, you can sleep in the bed.
I won't bite you.

295
00:48:17,935 --> 00:48:20,144
Unless you pay me.

296
00:48:26,768 --> 00:48:28,688
It is unpolite to stare.

297
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:47,314
Are you gonna tell me your name?
- Get dressed.

298
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:51,058
What for?
- We're going to dinner.

299
00:48:51,154 --> 00:48:52,978
We need to buy you a new dress.

300
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:58,259
You know you're really quite
charming when you aren't killing people.

301
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:30,709
This looks nice.
- Yeah.

302
00:49:30,805 --> 00:49:32,726
Don't you think?

303
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,662
Wait here.

304
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:20,249
Wait. What did you do?
Leave without me?

305
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,474
How do you know I wouldn't just take off?
- I didn't. Come on.

306
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,490
We have dinner reservations at eight.

307
00:50:31,386 --> 00:50:34,459
HEADQUARTER INTERPOL
LONDON

308
00:50:34,555 --> 00:50:38,683
How do you feel?
My pride hurts worse than my arms.

309
00:50:38,779 --> 00:50:40,891
Any word?

310
00:50:40,987 --> 00:50:46,844
The scetch is out to every Interpol-station in Europe.
Trainstations, airports, border-crossings...

311
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:49,820
What's that?
- This is what I wanted to show you.

312
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:53,372
Every appearence Belikov
has made in the last 12 months.

313
00:50:53,852 --> 00:50:57,885
This is from his speech he made in
London on May the seventh.

314
00:50:57,981 --> 00:51:05,757
And this is from some shitty bill-in school lunch he had in Georgia.
Look at the date.

315
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:09,117
May seventh.
How's that possible?.

316
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:13,342
I can't be sure. But unless he has figured
out how to be in two places at once?...

317
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:15,929
He has a dubble.
- He is certainly paranoid enough.

318
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:19,294
That explains the arterial spray.
- I hope he had health benfits.

319
00:51:26,303 --> 00:51:31,867
When I was a little girl, I had this little squarrel.
Black stripes on the back.

320
00:51:31,876 --> 00:51:33,316
Oh, yeah that's right.
His name was Tishka.

321
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,744
I'm sorry sir but this is for another
gentleman.

322
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,952
Table 26.
That's right.

323
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:45,312
My mistake.

324
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:52,321
You know what table that is?
- I saw the layout when we came in.

325
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:55,297
Do you remember everything you see?.
- No, not everything.

326
00:51:55,393 --> 00:52:00,098
What's the soup of the day?
- ...onion with dized tomatos.

327
00:52:01,154 --> 00:52:03,938
The woman sitting two tables behind you.
What is she wearing?.

328
00:52:04,034 --> 00:52:08,258
With the red hair and silk dress?
That is not a woman.

329
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:25,060
What color underwear am I wearing?
- You are not wearing any underwear.

330
00:52:41,189 --> 00:52:44,357
Nika, ask for the check.
- But I am not done.

331
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:46,950
Then... Hurry.

332
00:52:51,462 --> 00:52:53,286
You scratch that about me saying
you were charming.

333
00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:07,399
Excuse me, sir.

334
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:51,083
Surprise.
Thank you for the introducing of Udre Belikov.

335
00:54:08,652 --> 00:54:10,860
What the fuck?
- Let's go.

336
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:13,837
Now.

337
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:26,126
That was lovely.
Right up to the time when you dragged me out by my hair.

338
00:54:27,854 --> 00:54:29,294
Undress me.

339
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:34,190
So good with firearms,
not so good with ladies and their undergarments.

340
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:41,583
Careful, I'm not wearing any panties.
- Nika, you're drunk.

341
00:54:43,215 --> 00:54:48,304
And this is a very bad idea.
- Oh... You mean this?

342
00:54:49,168 --> 00:54:50,800
Yes, that.

343
00:54:51,568 --> 00:54:56,368
And this?
- Definetely that.

344
00:55:02,129 --> 00:55:04,337
This must be...

345
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,391
Mr. Price.

346
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:54,189
So... You took it upon yourself to change our appointment.

347
00:55:54,285 --> 00:55:57,645
How forward of you.
- As I told your men downstairs:

348
00:55:57,741 --> 00:56:02,061
I was attacked earlier tonight by some lunatic.
My common sense dictated...

349
00:56:02,157 --> 00:56:05,901
Your common sense should have dictated
you not abuse my good nature.

350
00:56:15,022 --> 00:56:19,919
I was just going over a few of my lines with
some of your competetors.

351
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,679
Lines.
Lines. Do you get it?

352
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:29,135
Where was I?

353
00:56:31,152 --> 00:56:32,784
He's not Price.

354
00:56:47,473 --> 00:56:57,746
This is the 'Decador', 9mm compaq.
It's...less than 2 kg, selects five singles, fully automatic.

355
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,530
Empty.

356
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:03,506
And safe.

357
00:57:04,562 --> 00:57:11,283
Or if you are looking for an assaultrifle,
I have the M203, with underbatter grenade launcher.

358
00:57:11,379 --> 00:57:18,579
A lot of third world dictators got a lot of 762 stuff...
It safes them from having to buy ammo.

359
00:57:19,348 --> 00:57:25,396
Everything here is available in bulk, of course.
Prices, not negotiable.

360
00:57:27,988 --> 00:57:31,637
Any questions, Mr Price?
- Yeah.

361
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:35,093
What about the little one there?

362
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:40,853
Yeah, I show you.
This is a Makarov.22.

363
00:57:40,949 --> 00:57:46,614
A favorite of the KGB...
Particually effective in the right hands.

364
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:54,390
But for a real target you need to find a soft spot...
- Hold up.

365
00:57:54,486 --> 00:58:01,015
This is not a Decador, it's a Chinese copy.
In fact, I don't know if it's the drugs,

366
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:05,143
but you've been wrong about most of these weapons.
If the gun you're holding is as cheap as this one...

367
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:09,080
even if you could manage to shoot her in the eye,
and I'm not saying you could.

368
00:58:09,176 --> 00:58:12,056
You wouldn't kill her.

369
00:59:43,167 --> 00:59:47,296
Why are you doing this to me?
- I need you to help me with your brother.

370
00:59:49,312 --> 00:59:54,304
Mikhail? Fine.
Fuck him, I do what ever you want.

371
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:59,297
What the fuck do you want me to do?
- Just this.

372
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:09,561
You know, it says here: When the male penquin
meets the female penquin,

373
01:01:09,657 --> 01:01:13,114
he knows in the first ten seconds
if he likes her or not.

374
01:01:14,554 --> 01:01:17,050
Are you listening?
- I'm listening.

375
01:01:17,434 --> 01:01:18,874
I read that.

376
01:01:19,354 --> 01:01:21,082
This article is full of shit.

377
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:25,115
Why do you buy these magazines?
- For the advertisements.

378
01:01:26,651 --> 01:01:32,027
What do you need luggage like this for?
- Because that perfectly holds my sniper 245.

379
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:36,731
and a gag for irritating talkative little girls like yourself.
Do you want me to stop and get it out?

380
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:39,708
I don't know.
Do you think we have time for foreplay?

381
01:01:53,053 --> 01:01:57,373
You know, when I was a little girl,
my father raised grapes.

382
01:01:58,813 --> 01:02:02,078
And I told him that I would
own my own wineyard one day.

383
01:02:10,334 --> 01:02:12,062
It looks nice.

384
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:19,647
We need to get off the road.

385
01:02:49,025 --> 01:02:51,618
Is that his suitcase?
How did we get that?

386
01:02:51,714 --> 01:02:56,610
As a consolation price Captain Gudnayev
send me our boy's stuff from the hotel in St. P..

387
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,333
In case it might help.
- Anything?

388
01:02:58,439 --> 01:02:59,874
Not much.

389
01:03:00,738 --> 01:03:07,747
There is this.
What do you make of this?

390
01:03:11,779 --> 01:03:17,156
Trust onto God and he shall direct your path.

391
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:21,380
Charms.
I never thought our boy as the religious type.

392
01:03:21,476 --> 01:03:24,356
That's strange.

393
01:03:43,078 --> 01:03:44,998
I have to go.

394
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,855
So much for happy endings.

395
01:03:54,215 --> 01:03:59,975
I don't want you to do this.
- Belikov needs to die.

396
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:03,912
I don't care about that.
Not anymore.

397
01:04:04,392 --> 01:04:08,136
As long as he's alive,
they will never stop looking for you.

398
01:04:41,835 --> 01:04:47,019
Take this. At the next station,
get off the train as soon as it stops.

399
01:04:47,115 --> 01:04:49,323
Move with the crowd.

400
01:04:50,379 --> 01:04:52,300
But I don't even know your name.

401
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:56,812
The place I was raised they didn't give us names.
They gave us numbers.

402
01:04:57,868 --> 01:05:00,172
Mine was 47.

403
01:05:01,996 --> 01:05:03,917
That explains a lot.

404
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:09,965
How will I find you?
- Don't worry. I'll find you.

405
01:05:10,061 --> 01:05:14,861
What are you going to do?
- What I do.

20
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,000
You have no idea of the pain involved in the procedure

21
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,800
They peel back the skin of the face...

22
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,800
and screw a teflon frame to the bones...

23
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,800
to duplicate the facial features.

24
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I wonder, if I had known the pain involved...

25
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
would I still have gone through with
this whole double business.

410
01:06:17,939 --> 01:06:19,667
Your drunk.

411
01:06:20,723 --> 01:06:23,891
You don't want to drink
with your new president?

412
01:06:28,211 --> 01:06:33,108
All the evidence has been erased.
Mikhail. Belikov.

413
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:37,620
This pathetic brother, Udre.

414
01:06:39,924 --> 01:06:44,341
Now I am the one and only.
The one man I have asked you to kill...

415
01:06:44,437 --> 01:06:48,949
The only one who can expose us,
is the only man not in this room!.

416
01:06:53,558 --> 01:06:57,974
Tell me, Comrad.
What excactly have you done to find him?

417
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:02,774
It seems if we wait long enough, 
he will find you.

418
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:09,682
Us. He will find us.
- The orginisation has sent in their best operatives.

419
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,855
I know.
Do not your incompetence hinder them,

420
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:15,831
if you want to have this conversation again.

421
01:07:32,825 --> 01:07:35,705
Three hours ago Belikovs brother Udre was
found dead in Istanbul.

422
01:07:35,897 --> 01:07:38,777
Ze wachten in Moskou
op het lichaam voor z'n begrafenis.

423
01:07:39,737 --> 01:07:44,533
Michael, how is things going?
- Belikov's brother has just been found murdered.

424
01:07:44,543 --> 01:07:48,186
It's him, sir. It's our guy.
He's setting Belikov up.

425
01:07:48,282 --> 01:07:52,026
But we're getting pressure from the ministiry and the EU
To drop this investigation.

426
01:07:52,122 --> 01:07:56,443
But the russians will confirm...
- The russians are the ones leading EU on this.

427
01:07:56,539 --> 01:08:00,379
They blatenly deny your ghost even excists.
And a foul paper is with the ministers office

428
01:08:00,475 --> 01:08:02,875
claiming you've overstepped your
athourity.

429
01:08:02,971 --> 01:08:08,252
Who brought those allegations?
- The FSB. Specifically Special Agent Jurij Markov.

430
01:08:08,348 --> 01:08:11,324
I need you to stop.
- No, you don't understand.

431
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:16,504
The FSB is covering this up.
He killed Belikov's brother. Why?

432
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:20,536
Why would he do that, unless...
- Belikov announced that attend funeral services...

433
01:08:20,546 --> 01:08:23,421
tomorrow morning for the burial...
- The funeral.

434
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:26,781
He's gonna take Belikov at Udre's funeral.

435
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:57,893
This generator produces over 3000 amps.
Much more than what is nessesary...

436
01:09:57,989 --> 01:10:00,869
I wanted you to understand the gravity of this situation.

437
01:10:00,965 --> 01:10:04,421
At 2.30. that radio taped to your
arm will activate.

438
01:10:04,431 --> 01:10:07,474
You'll have 30 seconds to order
the shooting of your friend Belikov.

439
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:11,910
If you don't, the generator will start.

440
01:10:12,006 --> 01:10:16,710
Your skin will melt, your blood will vayporise.
There won't be enough of you left,

441
01:10:16,806 --> 01:10:21,415
to identify.
- You have gone through a great deal of trouble.

442
01:10:21,511 --> 01:10:27,463
I am just a burekrat.
There is nothing I can do for you, I'm afraid.

443
01:10:27,559 --> 01:10:32,840
I disagree.
This is not a request, this situation is fixed.

444
01:10:32,936 --> 01:10:38,696
And you know both possible outcomes.
Live or die.

445
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:40,232
Your choice.

446
01:10:40,328 --> 01:10:44,073
Here's something to keep things
in perspective.

447
01:10:46,185 --> 01:10:48,393
I picked it up last night when
I was in your house.

448
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:52,905
You bastard!.
- If I were you I'd keep that radio dry.

449
01:10:55,882 --> 01:10:59,722
Yell all you like,
the lord himself won't hear you.

450
01:11:21,996 --> 01:11:26,508
There are over 100 specially trained alpha
soldiers in this cathedral.

451
01:11:26,604 --> 01:11:29,484
It will be foolish to attempt
any kind of violence.

452
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,789
A man as highly trained as your
assassin would realize this.

453
01:11:31,885 --> 01:11:34,669
What if he doesn't?
Look around you.

454
01:11:34,765 --> 01:11:39,277
How much civilian blood do you think will be shed?
- We are prepared for that as well.

455
01:11:39,373 --> 01:11:45,422
Gascans are being deployed. If anything should occur,
the civilians will be rendered unconsious.

456
01:11:45,518 --> 01:11:47,342
Now if you will excuse me.

457
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:42,930
Dames en heren, om te beginnen, wil ik u
en uw familie bedanken voor uw gebeden.

458
01:12:48,019 --> 01:12:49,747
One minute, fifty seconds.

459
01:12:49,843 --> 01:12:51,763
Answer. Answer.

460
01:12:55,699 --> 01:12:57,908
We zijn echt dankbaar.

461
01:12:58,004 --> 01:13:02,708
My brother he was a troubled man.
But he was not always like that.

462
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:05,684
One minute 25 seconds.

463
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:10,677
One minute 20 seconds.

464
01:13:11,733 --> 01:13:14,997
Shouldn't we choose to live and die
much like my brother?

465
01:13:15,477 --> 01:13:20,950
Should we do what is nessesary...
What is hard...To save what we love.

466
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:23,926
One minute.

467
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:32,278
I for one will not fail again.
Not with this country.

468
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:36,791
Not with our children's future,
Not with You, My countrymen...

469
01:13:39,383 --> 01:13:40,823
35 seconds.

470
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:47,736
Come in.
Change target, shoot Belikov.

26
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Are you sure?

27
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Come on!

473
01:14:00,793 --> 01:14:02,233
Fucking, do it now!.

474
01:14:25,563 --> 01:14:28,827
Release the gas.
Lock down the doors.

475
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:32,763
I sugest you and your men follow me.
- Let's go.

476
01:15:28,928 --> 01:15:33,056
Your man has made a mistake.
There is no exit. He's trapped.

477
01:15:36,801 --> 01:15:41,121
It doesn't make sense.
Why would he...

478
01:15:46,978 --> 01:15:53,218
Trust on to God... And he shall direct you path.

479
01:15:53,314 --> 01:15:56,194
Shit, he set us up from the very beginning.

480
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:49,863
Where does this key fit?
The last bishop's personal chambers.

481
01:16:49,959 --> 01:16:52,839
The clock tower.
Over there.

482
01:16:53,895 --> 01:16:58,407
He's going into the river like in St. P.
Jenkins, let's go.

483
01:17:01,672 --> 01:17:05,992
He is in the southwest tower. Call
the gun ships. Do not let him escape.

484
01:17:07,816 --> 01:17:12,425
Seems I underestimated you.
- Consistently.

485
01:17:14,729 --> 01:17:16,841
A miscalculation on my part.

486
01:17:20,201 --> 01:17:21,737
Who are you?

487
01:17:23,369 --> 01:17:24,810
Answer me.

488
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:27,493
Let me help you.
- How would you do that?

489
01:17:27,503 --> 01:17:31,146
By having me killed?.
No for that I am sorry. It was a mistake.

490
01:17:31,242 --> 01:17:35,082
And Nika, was that a mistake? Or did you
destroy her life for your amusement?

491
01:17:35,178 --> 01:17:40,555
Do you think you can take what has cost 
millions, years of planning,

492
01:17:40,651 --> 01:17:43,531
for the good of this country?
And destroy that?

493
01:17:43,627 --> 01:17:48,908
Then what? Walk away?
You don't really think they will let you do that.

494
01:17:49,004 --> 01:17:54,476
If you kill me they will never let you go.
They will hunt you for the rest of your life.

495
01:18:04,154 --> 01:18:07,802
You did your job.
And you did it very well.

496
01:18:08,858 --> 01:18:13,754
And for that my boy, you should be proud.
- That's it?

497
01:18:14,042 --> 01:18:21,051
Yes, I'm offering you your life back. That is
why you are here, yes, that is what you want.

498
01:18:23,451 --> 01:18:25,371
No?
- No.

28
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
He shot the president!

500
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:58,115
Interpol, drop your weapons.
We have an arrestwarrent for that man.

501
01:20:03,107 --> 01:20:05,892
Don't move.
Hands on your head.

502
01:20:05,988 --> 01:20:08,868
On your knees.
Don't do anything stupid.

503
01:20:52,167 --> 01:20:57,160
Just one thing:
Knowing how it ends, was it worth it?

504
01:20:57,832 --> 01:21:03,976
Killing Belikov.
- Knowing how this ends... Definetely.

505
01:21:05,897 --> 01:21:07,337
What do you make of that?

506
01:21:29,034 --> 01:21:33,355
Who the hell are you?
- I'm agent Smith, CIA.

507
01:21:33,451 --> 01:21:36,523
I need all of you men to the rear of that vecicle.
- You don't have juristiction here.

508
01:21:36,619 --> 01:21:42,284
We aren't here. That means that when we open
up with... then this will never have happened.

509
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:47,276
We have reason to believe that you
are involved in terrorist activities.

510
01:21:47,372 --> 01:21:52,556
We're Interpol. And in accordance with section 3,
we're transporting an international criminal.

511
01:21:53,036 --> 01:21:54,765
What criminal?

512
01:21:57,453 --> 01:21:59,565
You know what, I'm sorry man.

513
01:22:01,101 --> 01:22:04,173
My mistake, I thought you were somenone else.

514
01:22:04,269 --> 01:22:11,278
You prick.
- On behalf of the U.S. government I would like to extent your... sincerest apology.

515
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:14,350
Load up, boys.

516
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,744
We're even.

517
01:22:42,192 --> 01:22:45,745
So now what?
- Now you have to answer my question.

518
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:51,217
Are you a good man, Inspector?
I think.

519
01:22:51,313 --> 01:22:53,521
And yet you've killed men.

520
01:22:53,617 --> 01:22:58,226
So, Inspector, how does a good man
decide when to kill?

521
01:23:00,242 --> 01:23:06,483
If I think a man means to do me or my family harm
I will do whatever I can to stop them.

522
01:23:06,579 --> 01:23:11,379
But beyond that... It's a crap-shoot.

523
01:23:15,603 --> 01:23:21,076
The key...
You knew I had juristiction.

524
01:23:21,172 --> 01:23:26,548
And would walk you right out the front door.
- I wanna be left alone.

525
01:23:27,892 --> 01:23:30,004
Just like that.
Yeah, just like that.

526
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:37,781
This is the man you've been looking for.

527
01:23:39,317 --> 01:23:41,909
Ballistics will confirm that he was shot
by your weapon.

528
01:23:43,062 --> 01:23:48,347
The magazine is on the night stand next to your bed.
Don't forget it when you call your superiors.

529
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:51,793
Did you kill him here?
- It's five.

530
01:23:51,803 --> 01:23:53,425
Wait a few hours until the
girls go to school.

531
01:23:53,434 --> 01:23:57,367
You woa't have to expose them to this.
Explains why you waited so long before you called it in.

532
01:23:57,463 --> 01:24:00,631
I can't go along with this.
- I hope you can.

533
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:03,607
For both our sakes.

534
01:24:05,815 --> 01:24:07,256
Goodbye, Michael.

535
01:24:13,016 --> 01:24:15,032
I hope I never see you again.

29
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
St. Petersburg - Russia

536
01:24:47,867 --> 01:24:49,979
I told you to leave her alone.

537
01:24:50,267 --> 01:24:52,379
You should have listened.
