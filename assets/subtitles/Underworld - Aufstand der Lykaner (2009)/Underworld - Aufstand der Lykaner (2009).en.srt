1
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:58,439
<i>Two decades had passed since
the creation of both species ...</i>

2
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,136
<i>The war had begun ...</i>

3
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:03,516
<i>Victor increased his army,</i>

4
00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:08,027
<i>Creating a legion of vampires to protect
them from the very first clan of warewolves.</i>

5
00:01:08,113 --> 00:01:14,199
<i>A vicious and infectious breed,
unable to take human form ever again.</i>

6
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:17,586
<i>Until he was born.</i>

7
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,459
<i>Lucian.</i>

8
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:34,502
<i>And although every fiber of his soul
wound him to slay this child,</i>

9
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:37,267
<i>he did not.</i>

10
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:46,129
<i>Over the years, this child grew...</i>

11
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:50,887
<i>He possesed a strength and focus
that the ones before him did not.</i>

12
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:18,951
What do you think, Sonya?

13
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:21,239
Shall we make more?

14
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:24,954
Of him?
- Like him!

15
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,166
Lucian will always be 
the first of the breed.

16
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:31,257
The first of the Lycans.

17
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:42,673
<i>Victor would use Lucian's infectious
blood to his benefit.</i>

18
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,774
<i>Taking advantage
of the child's thirst,</i>

19
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,058
<i> pitting it against him
as he was forced to feed on humans, </i>

20
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:50,311
<i>Victor's slaves.</i>

21
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,869
<i> Instead, he created a
new race of immortals. </i>

22
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:26,272
<i> Lycans.
Werewolf, but also human. </i>

23
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:31,430
<i> Unlike the others,
this new breed could be harnessed. </i>

24
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:35,892
<i> Enslaved to guard them in 
the daylight hours of their masters. </i>

25
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:41,362
<i>Or so Victor thought ,
so very long ago ...</i>

26
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:46,645
U N D E R W O R L D

27
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:52,787
Rise of the Lycans

28
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:07,996
The nobles are upset, my lord.
William's Hestilands has not been checked.

29
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,949
Werewolves have killed their slaves.

30
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:11,776
Humans upset ...

31
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:15,184
Tannis, please take a note of what pain that brings me.

32
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,235
Yet, their lost slaves
means our lost...

33
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:23,056
Enough! Have I not increased are shares ten fold
since Marcus and the medias took their sleep?

34
00:04:23,142 --> 00:04:27,848
We'll deal with the wolves as
we always have.

35
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:45,437
Have you nothing better to do, blacksmith,
than play with weapons of war?

36
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:47,690
At least make your self useful.

37
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:51,723
A little gratitude, Sonya,
to the one who saved your life.

38
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:53,904
I needed no savior.

39
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,131
Tell me, Lucian, does it burden your heart
to you kill your own kind?

40
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:03,067
Not at all.
They are mindless beasts, my lord.

41
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:06,586
No brothren of mine.
- Really?

42
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:08,928
Father.

43
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:20,525
You are a credit to your race.
Do you know how to remain so?

44
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:23,902
Keep your eyes on the ground.

45
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:27,123
Get rid of that.

46
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:32,643
You were sorry missed the council.

47
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,656
There are other demands
of my time as you know.

48
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:39,203
I see. I hope you have enjoyed
your little moonlit ride.

49
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:40,457
I was out patrolling.

50
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,781
You would disobeying. I told
you to stay within these walls.

51
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,326
You risk too much,
for a father to ignore!

52
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:48,680
You would lead the wolves to the death dealers.

53
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:51,820
And why father, is my risk
any greater than theirs?

54
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,896
They are not my daughters.

55
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:57,534
And they are not council members.
You are.

56
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,849
And one day you will become an elder,
your birthright.

57
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:07,873
Sonya, you are well forth on that council.

58
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,579
But that is precarious thing.

59
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:13,204
They grow tired of your games
and your absence.

60
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,810
The dangers of the forest are not
greater than those of the council tribe.

61
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,075
You will learn the dance of politics,
to be ruthless and cunning.

62
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:27,714
And above all, you will be loyal
to your family.

63
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:31,488
To me.

64
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:34,660
After all, without
the loyalty between us ...

65
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:38,591
we are no better than the
beasts at our door.

66
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:40,217
Lycan!

67
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:42,611
No! Westdog!

68
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:51,793
Enough!

69
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:54,717
You dare raise your hand to me?

70
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,002
I said that is enough.
- So says the master's dog.

71
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:00,292
You will not always be his favorite.

72
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:03,932
If you fall I will be there.

73
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:06,425
Let us hope so.

74
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,087
What are you looking at?
Get back to work!

75
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:12,753
Go back to work!

76
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,867
The matter before the council is simple.

77
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:26,829
We are under attack.

78
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:28,897
Six times in half as many weeks ...

79
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,309
William's kind has reached our very walls.

80
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:35,266
What mayhem would follow
if one of them got through?

81
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:37,983
Your fear Coloman, is misplaced.

82
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:40,399
Are we not protected by
an army of immortals?

83
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:43,541
Superbly, my lord.
However, the nobles are not.

84
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:46,785
And as I appointed out, they are the grass
in which we graze.

85
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:50,057
If we cannot protect our humans
that makes us look weak.

86
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:52,766
And how would you project strength?

87
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,631
As our death dealers
patrol the night ...

88
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:56,934
So our daylight guards
can patrol the day.

89
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,958
Lycans patrol outside the walls?
Have you lost your mind?

90
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:02,860
They are born of beasts ...

91
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:06,503
and the savagery of this dispicable fact
cannot be bred away!

92
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:09,476
I think you fear
of this idea is misplaced.

93
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:12,565
We can create a priviledge class of Lycans.

94
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,954
greater rations, finer quaters...

95
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,132
and put them under the hand
of one we trust.

96
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:22,515
Thats your pet Lucian, the one who saved
your daughter's life today.

97
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:26,987
In fact, I think we should
hear her thoughts on this matter.

98
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:35,223
She seems to have been needed elsewhere.
- Find her.

99
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,912
I would take your suggestion...

100
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:43,785
under advisement.
- Thanks, my lord.

101
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:47,913
It would be gratifying to be able to reassure
the nobles when they arrive tomorrow,

102
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,478
that we have their interest at hand.

103
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:29,856
My Lady?

104
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:53,460
Is it true what you told my father?

105
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:57,193
That you feel nothing when you kill them?

106
00:14:57,994 --> 00:15:00,281
They're just animals.

107
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:04,160
Incapable of social fitting.

108
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:08,398
So why should I feel anything for them.

109
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:14,253
Sonya, if I were to leave from here...

110
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,498
Would you come with me?

111
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,734
Leave?

112
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:26,388
Do not say that.
Do not even think it.

113
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:29,238
They would hunt you down and mark you
like one of the others.

114
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:31,449
Not if I can remove this.

115
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:33,755
Look!

116
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:38,574
I made it.
This will be my freedom!

117
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,866
Lucian, promise me
you won't use it!

118
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:48,088
Please!
- Is that your answer then? You will not come?

119
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:50,679
So you want me to stay here for you?

120
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:52,298
Like this?
Like an animal?

121
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,364
Lucian.

122
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:04,138
Vampire and Lycan, we are both
children of Corvinus.

123
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:07,210
But my family are slaves.

124
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:09,891
I will use this key ...

125
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:13,361
and I will leave this place.

126
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:19,414
But I can never be without you now.

127
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,660
Any news of my daughter?
- She is not to find.

128
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:15,979
She refuses to see me.

129
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:19,352
And she won't answer her door.
Why are the young so blind?

130
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,897
She risk her seat in the council
and for what?

131
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:25,878
I cannot imagine.

132
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:31,082
You must prepare, my lord.
Human nobles are on their way.

133
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:26,216
It's sharp.
No wolf will stand before it.

134
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:30,800
Ready the horses!

135
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:34,091
Let someone else go.
- Why?

136
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:37,346
Last night, after I left ...

137
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:39,394
Just let someone else go.

138
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,193
In case it has escaped
your notice, blacksmith ...

139
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:45,838
I am quite capable of looking after myself.

140
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,458
And besides...

141
00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:56,757
you can watch over me from the wall.

142
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:08,970
Lady Sonya, your father has ordered
you to stay behind.

143
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:12,046
I intend to see our guest safely
through the gate.

144
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:15,066
Gate Master!
- This is not a request.

145
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:16,858
Your father is ruler of the covenant.

146
00:19:16,944 --> 00:19:20,780
So he keeps reminding me.

147
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:42,119
Careful, blacksmith.
There's two eyes between your secret.

148
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:53,025
Shut it my child!
Shut it.

149
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:26,557
Get your men out there, now!
- Down boy. Your leech is too tight?

150
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,398
Step away!
- There's too many of them ...

151
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:31,509
They'll be massacred!

152
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:38,382
Stop him!

153
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:05,175
Dimitri!

154
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:11,968
Lucian!

155
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:28,712
Sonya!

156
00:22:45,904 --> 00:22:49,399
Lucian, no!

157
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:35,153
No!

158
00:23:46,648 --> 00:23:49,131
He did it to save me.

159
00:23:49,298 --> 00:23:53,455
Am I not master of this house?

160
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,349
You know you are forbidden
to remove your shuckle.

161
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,335
Yes.

162
00:23:57,421 --> 00:24:01,547
Yet you break my law
after I gave you your life?

163
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:06,121
Your days of flush living are over!
Slave!

164
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:08,638
Father, leave him be.
I told you already ..

165
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:11,007
Hold your tongue!

166
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:14,740
You have defied me
for the last time.

167
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:17,505
Get her outta here!

168
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:31,038
<i>Burn the bodies.
Burn them all.</i>

169
00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:09,322
<i> for removing the collar ...
30 lashes!</i>

170
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,632
You have stung me, Lycan,
with your betrayal.

171
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:31,059
You were like a son to me.

172
00:25:31,145 --> 00:25:35,206
I gave you your life.
- You gave me chains.

173
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:39,194
I wouldn't thought that after all these years
you would have known ...

174
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,898
you can not have one
without the other.

175
00:25:45,988 --> 00:25:48,592
Do it!

176
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:59,004
I've told you I'd be there
when you fell.

177
00:27:07,905 --> 00:27:11,122
Stop this. He is one of our protectors ...
- They are just beast themselves.

178
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:13,866
This could stir up the others.
- Let them stir

179
00:27:13,952 --> 00:27:16,747
Do you fear and believe me,
it will be worst if we do not punish them

180
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,994
Do you see now, Coloman?
You would trust them outside the walls?

181
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,043
We can not even trust them inside!

182
00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:25,522
By my count, that's 21.

183
00:27:25,608 --> 00:27:28,465
Continue.

184
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:56,247
Stay away from him.
Or they'll punish you too.

185
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:14,898
Your concern for Lucian
was most touching.

186
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:18,955
A slave.
- He had just saved my life.

187
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:23,105
Was it not you, who told me to show
a little gratitude?

188
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:26,998
And yourself? Have you no gratitude
for the one who saved our daughter's life?

189
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:31,881
I am awashed with it
That it lives shows the breath of my Magnalimita.

190
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:37,848
Were it other circumstances, I would have had him
fed into pieces to his own kind.

191
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:41,038
But his punishment is now over.

192
00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:44,930
He will be freed.
- Freed?

193
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:47,325
Your judgement is clouded, Sonya.

194
00:28:47,411 --> 00:28:49,016
We do not keep order with sentiment.

195
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,693
Lucian forbidden to remove his collar
and yet he did so.

196
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:56,125
For however finer reason ...

197
00:28:56,672 --> 00:28:59,444
he will remain in prison.

198
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:08,349
Janosh and the other nobles
will soon arrive.

199
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:11,996
Your presence is expected.

200
00:29:17,837 --> 00:29:20,522
I saw what you did out there.

201
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:26,277
Very brave ...
for a human.

202
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:32,729
Have you come across them preformed?

203
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:34,987
Only in stories.

204
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,191
Were you not afraid of them?
- Yes.

205
00:29:40,243 --> 00:29:45,098
But I wanted to live.
- Are you afraid of me?

206
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,604
Yes.

207
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,818
Well then, don't be.

208
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:58,132
I will not bite.
Much.

209
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:03,173
You are like them?
- No.

210
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:07,801
A Lycan, yes.
But not like them.

211
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:11,743
Those you fought with tonight, were animals,
less born of William ...

212
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:13,705
a pure blood.

213
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:19,173
No trace of man left.
Savage, mindless beasts.

214
00:30:20,424 --> 00:30:23,721
As you were told.
- I saw you.

215
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,500
They obeyed you.

216
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:32,772
Yes.

217
00:30:34,493 --> 00:30:36,870
Yes, they did.

218
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:55,242
You should not be here.
- I had to.

219
00:30:55,328 --> 00:30:57,387
My love, I'm sorry.

220
00:30:57,473 --> 00:30:59,089
I'm allright.

221
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:01,010
This is my fault.
If I had not gone out ...

222
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:04,037
Then you would not be who you are.

223
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:07,861
This is not your fault.

224
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,754
I can not remain here.
I have to leave this place.

225
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,596
My father will never permit.

226
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:16,100
And your death dealers?
Is there anyone you can trust?

227
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:19,752
Their loyalty to my father is much
greater than their loyalty to me.

228
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:23,027
Tannis?
- Tannis, can not be trusted.

229
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:25,546
No. Tannis know about us.

230
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:28,981
How?
- I have no idea, but ...

231
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:32,418
if he has not told your father,
then that means he wants something.

232
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:34,628
Sonya, find out what it is.

233
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,393
Bring them in.

234
00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:45,053
Janosh!

235
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:52,183
Do you not own
the largest silver mine in these lands?

236
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:54,649
It has been overrun, my lord.

237
00:32:54,735 --> 00:32:58,091
Our workers, infected, turned to beasts.

238
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:01,591
Most unfortunate and costly.

239
00:33:02,673 --> 00:33:07,139
I think half the rights to your mine
should cover the expense of our assistance.

240
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:09,113
Your assistance?

241
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:11,539
We have all seen the fires
on the way here.

242
00:33:11,713 --> 00:33:14,737
And have learned of the death of
baron Cavasher and his family.

243
00:33:14,823 --> 00:33:17,803
The wolves are at your door as well.

244
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:19,804
So why should I
pay tribute?

245
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,574
You can not so much
protect your own house!

246
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,744
You are all but bled me dry already.

247
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,307
We have all heard the stories.

248
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:31,980
Look in his eyes!
They are true!

249
00:33:32,073 --> 00:33:34,722
This place is cursed!

250
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:39,393
They are no more human than the
devils that invade our land!

251
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:42,622
If devil you should call us rest assure ...

252
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:45,082
better the devil you know.

253
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:48,350
Unhand me!
- Certainly.

254
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,988
Will anyone else like to be heard?

255
00:34:37,558 --> 00:34:41,115
We are not animals!

256
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,870
Is this what you want?
To be their entertainment, their play things?

257
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:49,570
Their pets?

258
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:52,217
Cowering beneath the whip ...

259
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:54,996
and then fighting amongst yourselves?

260
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,923
Is this what you want?

261
00:35:02,098 --> 00:35:05,307
I've lived by their rules
my entire life.

262
00:35:05,966 --> 00:35:09,346
I've protected them,
envied them...

263
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:11,737
And for what?

264
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:14,694
To be treated like an animal.

265
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:17,340
We are not animals!

266
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:21,168
We do have a choice!

267
00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:24,746
We can choose
to be more than this!

268
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:27,097
We can be slaves ...

269
00:35:27,545 --> 00:35:30,752
or we can be Lycans!

270
00:35:36,588 --> 00:35:39,964
Morning is upon us, my child.

271
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:43,746
It's time we
left this writched night behind.

272
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:47,529
Gladly.
- There are some difficult decisions ahead.

273
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:49,615
I would like your help with one of them.

274
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:51,532
Of course, Father.

275
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:53,821
With Lucian gone...

276
00:35:53,907 --> 00:35:57,065
we must promote another Lycan
in his place.

277
00:35:58,297 --> 00:35:59,616
Gone?

278
00:35:59,702 --> 00:36:02,173
Coloman thinks he will
stir the others.

279
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:04,452
We must remove him.

280
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,837
That will be difficult.

281
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,903
He has been with us so long.

282
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,493
Perhaps, Gyorg.

283
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:25,866
Or Thrasos.

284
00:36:27,698 --> 00:36:29,891
They would be...

285
00:36:30,294 --> 00:36:34,238
trustworthy.
- Excellent suggestions.

286
00:36:34,343 --> 00:36:37,688
I will consider them strongly.

287
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:10,868
<i> You, my child, are
the most precious thing in my heart.</i>

288
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:36,103
What have you told my father?

289
00:37:36,189 --> 00:37:38,131
What have you told him?
- Nothing.

290
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:39,735
Why?
- Why what?

291
00:37:39,821 --> 00:37:42,630
Why have you told him nothing?

292
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,706
Would your father welcome the man
who brought him news...

293
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,561
that his beloved daughter was consorting with ...

294
00:37:49,896 --> 00:37:52,180
a Lycan?

295
00:37:56,252 --> 00:37:59,458
He isn't well known
for his gratitude.

296
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:14,796
And I am not yet in a position
to use this for my benefit.

297
00:38:17,657 --> 00:38:20,208
What sort of benefit?

298
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:26,879
There are 12 council seats.
- And we don't die often.

299
00:38:27,553 --> 00:38:28,975
Sadly, no.

300
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:33,409
So what if I give up my seat on the Council
and this simply left it to you?

301
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:37,694
Why would you do that?
- Can you keep a secret?

302
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:43,774
I will need something in return.

303
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:10,987
Two minutes. Any longer is too risky.

304
00:39:15,074 --> 00:39:18,630
I'm sorry.
There was no other way.

305
00:39:23,678 --> 00:39:25,147
Tannis?

306
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:28,766
You were right. He will help us in exchange
for a sit on the council.

307
00:39:28,852 --> 00:39:30,672
And your father knows nothing?
- I'm sure of it!

308
00:39:30,758 --> 00:39:33,163
Sonya, this won't work!
Lucian it has to.

309
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:36,777
I knew some of the others will come with me:
Sabas and Xristo, the human race.

310
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:39,245
My Love. - Lucian there is no time!

311
00:39:39,331 --> 00:39:42,539
My father will have you killed tomorrow
after the humans return.

312
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:45,115
You must leave at sunrise.

313
00:39:45,325 --> 00:39:48,634
And you?
- The important thing is that you stay alive.

314
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,622
The best chance you have is when
Victor and death dealers sleep.

315
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,886
I will be safe at my father's side when you go.

316
00:39:53,972 --> 00:39:55,578
Hurry!

317
00:39:55,664 --> 00:39:58,404
If this plan works, I'll meet you in
three days time after the sunsets.

318
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,388
There is a clearing by the river.
I'll meet you there.

319
00:40:08,512 --> 00:40:12,266
And if it doesn't?
- I will meet you at the clearing.

320
00:40:33,388 --> 00:40:36,687
Get up.
Dumb animals.

321
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:43,209
Be brave.

322
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:50,896
You know what your problem is?

323
00:40:53,908 --> 00:40:56,637
You don't understand the natural order
of things.

324
00:40:57,443 --> 00:40:59,402
Things change.

325
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:02,092
Be ready when they do.

326
00:41:08,658 --> 00:41:11,525
Consider it a parting gift.

327
00:41:51,526 --> 00:41:53,770
Wait!

328
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:59,707
Do you not realize
this is a gift I'm giving you?

329
00:41:59,793 --> 00:42:02,120
It's a curse!

330
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:16,580
What have they done to us?
-You'll find out soon enough.

331
00:42:17,022 --> 00:42:19,861
They turned us into them, like you?

332
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:21,316
Yes.

333
00:42:21,402 --> 00:42:25,301
Why?
- He wants to use you for his own protection.

334
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:29,604
I would die first.

335
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:33,847
The time has come. By sunrise
I leave this place.

336
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:36,947
And if you are willing to take the risk,
you may follow me

337
00:42:40,843 --> 00:42:44,650
There is a new life waiting
behind these walls, my friend.

338
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:48,022
And you can be a part of it.
One of us.

339
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:51,196
Or stay and serve them.

340
00:43:01,236 --> 00:43:04,550
New dogs today.
Let's see how they look.

341
00:43:04,636 --> 00:43:06,534
You've come too late.

342
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,649
He's already gone.

343
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:43,975
Are you with me?

344
00:44:16,981 --> 00:44:20,989
Sabas, Xristo, free the others
The rest of you, with me!

345
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:30,351
Freedom is yours.
Move!

346
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:37,104
This way!

347
00:44:37,724 --> 00:44:40,450
Right Here!

348
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,318
Run! Run!

349
00:45:16,361 --> 00:45:19,693
Keep moving!

350
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,318
Raze!

351
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:14,928
There is nothing you can do!

352
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:18,629
I will come back. I promise you!

353
00:46:18,715 --> 00:46:20,785
No!

354
00:46:23,725 --> 00:46:25,899
My lord!

355
00:46:30,657 --> 00:46:33,044
My lord, Lucian has escaped.

356
00:46:58,905 --> 00:47:00,410
The forest, go!

357
00:47:00,496 --> 00:47:02,671
Go!

358
00:47:18,924 --> 00:47:21,147
My lord!

359
00:47:42,081 --> 00:47:43,993
Move! Move!

360
00:47:49,462 --> 00:47:51,640
Tannis!

361
00:47:51,843 --> 00:47:53,395
Come on, come on!

362
00:47:53,481 --> 00:47:55,532
Yes, my lord?

363
00:47:55,618 --> 00:47:58,265
Where is the key
I gave you for this?

364
00:47:58,517 --> 00:48:00,019
I locked it in the armory myself

365
00:48:00,105 --> 00:48:02,307
How then is it open?

366
00:48:02,787 --> 00:48:05,693
I have no idea.
- I think I have.

367
00:48:06,605 --> 00:48:08,773
Kill him!
- No!

368
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:11,152
Please ...

369
00:48:11,507 --> 00:48:13,105
Check the armory.

370
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:17,771
There has to be an explanation.
Show me.

371
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,408
I've never been outside the walls.

372
00:48:29,494 --> 00:48:30,742
Enjoy it while you can Xristo,

373
00:48:30,828 --> 00:48:33,408
because soon enough we
got to fight our way back in.

374
00:48:33,549 --> 00:48:37,002
We did not all make it out.
Now, we will not leave or brothers rot back there.

375
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:39,968
We have humiliated Viktor
they will pay the cost.

376
00:48:40,054 --> 00:48:42,320
We were lucky to make it
out alive

377
00:48:42,406 --> 00:48:46,525
There is a handful of us, we have no weapons.
- true.

378
00:48:46,611 --> 00:48:49,507
The nobles had brought you here
can you lead us back to his state?

379
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,093
Yes.
- Good. Come on.

380
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,542
It has to be here.

381
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:34,113
Here.

382
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:39,455
He must have made another one.

383
00:49:40,671 --> 00:49:43,637
I never doubted you.

384
00:49:50,758 --> 00:49:54,232
I have no wish to remove one shuckle
around your neck

385
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:57,539
only to replace it
with one of my own.

386
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:59,053
You have a choice.

387
00:49:59,139 --> 00:50:03,039
You can run away and hide
or stay and fight.

388
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:06,943
Any man who fights with me
shall have his freedom ...

389
00:50:07,029 --> 00:50:11,823
and if he wishes it...
immortality.

390
00:50:26,948 --> 00:50:29,374
There are other states
to the west of here.

391
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,942
I want you to go there.
See how many will join us.

392
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:38,226
I will meet you here
in two days time.

393
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:56,923
Father!

394
00:52:57,009 --> 00:53:01,401
Did I startle you?
- No!

395
00:53:01,495 --> 00:53:05,536
You did not.
- It occurs to me ...

396
00:53:05,622 --> 00:53:09,644
That I had been thoughtless.

397
00:53:10,135 --> 00:53:14,505
So deep about being in my own
anguish of Lucian's betrayal

398
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:17,336
I gave no thought ...

399
00:53:17,422 --> 00:53:20,261
to your feelings.

400
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:24,430
My feelings?
- They worm their way into our lives ...

401
00:53:24,516 --> 00:53:28,157
and we forget the traversity
of their birth

402
00:53:28,994 --> 00:53:32,106
I myself had feelings towards Lucian.

403
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:37,311
He could have been anything,
a death dealer perhaps.

404
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:40,203
Yes.

405
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:43,656
Perhaps.

406
00:53:45,282 --> 00:53:47,851
But he was not as we hoped.

407
00:53:47,937 --> 00:53:50,823
Was he?

408
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,991
Did you help him escape?

409
00:53:57,176 --> 00:53:59,647
Help him?

410
00:53:59,733 --> 00:54:02,264
Ofcourse not!

411
00:54:03,645 --> 00:54:06,655
Are you lying to me?

412
00:54:07,261 --> 00:54:10,655
There are many things
that I have done against you.

413
00:54:10,741 --> 00:54:13,694
But he is a Lycan.

414
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:19,864
I'm sorry, my dear ...

415
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,668
but you leave me no choice.

416
00:54:32,563 --> 00:54:35,308
Father, please!

417
00:54:35,394 --> 00:54:37,342
I wanted to believe your lies!

418
00:54:37,428 --> 00:54:40,056
But I knew it cannot be true,
not my own daughter

419
00:54:40,142 --> 00:54:43,313
How could you?
- Father ...

420
00:54:44,081 --> 00:54:50,128
I love him.
- No! You have betrayed me!

421
00:54:50,214 --> 00:54:53,962
To be with an animal!

422
00:54:54,048 --> 00:54:58,470
I loved you more
than anything!

423
00:54:58,805 --> 00:55:02,448
She does not leave this room.

424
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:22,922
We have received orders
to wait.

425
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:33,436
At this rate, we'll have enough
men by the end of the week.

426
00:55:33,522 --> 00:55:37,638
Has there been any sign of Sonya?
- Nothing.

427
00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:41,714
She should been here by now.

428
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,004
With all due respect, Lucian, I do not see
why we are waiting for her.

429
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,502
She is not one of us.

430
00:55:46,588 --> 00:55:49,730
Have you forgotten she was the one
who set us free?

431
00:55:49,857 --> 00:55:52,026
But she is a vampire.

432
00:55:52,112 --> 00:55:55,169
She has deceived you.
She could lead him here!

433
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:57,764
Death dealers were undoubtedly
beyond the hunt.

434
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:03,069
And they will eventually find us.
But not by her doing.

435
00:56:07,222 --> 00:56:11,629
I trust Sonya with my life
and as long as I make command, so shall you.

436
00:56:14,311 --> 00:56:17,268
I told you not to say anything.

437
00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:22,877
Lucian has sacked two estates in Brashoff, my lord.

438
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,433
And made off with
the contents of their armories.

439
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:28,289
The slaves had joined his ranks.
- Freedom is as much as deceased...

440
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:31,290
as William's pestilents.
- You need to bring your pet back.

441
00:56:31,376 --> 00:56:34,445
Thank you, Coloman!
The obvious escapes me.

442
00:56:34,531 --> 00:56:40,715
I do not need to lift a finger.
Lucian will return at his own free will.

443
00:56:41,967 --> 00:56:45,546
I have something he wants.

444
00:56:46,343 --> 00:56:48,657
My Lady.

445
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:01,316
Luka!
What is it? Where is she?

446
00:57:01,402 --> 00:57:03,592
Sonya has been arrested.

447
00:57:04,144 --> 00:57:07,567
He knows about the two of you.

448
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:10,143
He will kill her.

449
00:57:10,229 --> 00:57:12,758
I thought you should know.

450
00:57:31,995 --> 00:57:34,529
Nothing in, my lord.

451
00:57:37,327 --> 00:57:40,597
It is a trap and you know that.
- I will not let her die alone.

452
00:57:40,683 --> 00:57:43,442
They followed you here, Lucian.
If you go we will lose.

453
00:57:43,528 --> 00:57:45,973
Let me tell you a secret, my friend.
The only thought they followed me ...

454
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:49,696
But they truly followed is the idea of being free free.
That is what brought them here.

455
00:57:49,782 --> 00:57:51,652
You can hold them together until I get back.

456
00:57:51,738 --> 00:57:54,354
And leave them if I do not.

457
00:59:51,645 --> 00:59:54,147
Are you alright?
- Yes.

458
00:59:54,233 --> 00:59:58,207
Lucian, you were free
- Not without you.

459
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,329
We have to go, now!

460
01:00:36,236 --> 01:00:38,433
My lord!

461
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:44,042
Your daughter has escaped.
- Ah, of course.

462
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:10,442
This way!

463
01:01:17,213 --> 01:01:20,286
That one!
- Yes!

464
01:01:55,621 --> 01:01:58,074
Now!

465
01:02:41,922 --> 01:02:44,445
How dare you rise your hand to me?

466
01:02:44,531 --> 01:02:47,383
I do not want this.
- I am your father!

467
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:05,401
Think you can defeat me?
I don't want to defeat you ...

468
01:03:17,151 --> 01:03:19,739
Killing me won't save
your precious Lycan.

469
01:03:19,825 --> 01:03:24,081
Please call up your men!
For the sake of your grandchild!

470
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:31,528
A miracle, father!

471
01:03:31,614 --> 01:03:34,378
A union of the bloodlines.

472
01:03:37,835 --> 01:03:39,424
I curse the day
your mother gave her life ...

473
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,340
to bring you into this world.

474
01:03:41,426 --> 01:03:44,376
That thing inside you ...

475
01:03:44,704 --> 01:03:47,529
is a monstrosity!

476
01:03:49,553 --> 01:03:51,844
Sonya!

477
01:03:52,014 --> 01:03:55,001
This is over. Remove him!

478
01:03:55,469 --> 01:04:00,106
Do you understand what you done?
This night was not about you, It was about him.

479
01:04:00,192 --> 01:04:04,189
I could have given Lucian to the council
and need never have known of your indiscression.

480
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:06,879
But after this, never!

481
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:12,176
No!

482
01:04:21,184 --> 01:04:25,502
If I had not left, none
of this would have happened.

483
01:04:26,368 --> 01:04:28,998
And you would not be who you are.

484
01:04:29,858 --> 01:04:31,525
You're right.

485
01:04:31,611 --> 01:04:34,501
Noone should live a life like this.

486
01:04:35,393 --> 01:04:37,953
Some are free, because to you.

487
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,842
Things have forever changed
because of what you have done.

488
01:04:41,928 --> 01:04:44,367
But I have failed you!
- No.

489
01:04:44,453 --> 01:04:46,677
Lucian, my love ...

490
01:04:47,896 --> 01:04:50,423
You have not failed me.

491
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,865
The choices I made
have led me here.

492
01:04:54,951 --> 01:04:57,237
Not you.

493
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:02,076
This shows the risk you are willing to take for me.

494
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:05,291
I would also do it for you.

495
01:05:05,377 --> 01:05:07,734
For us.

496
01:05:08,545 --> 01:05:11,139
Open the door!

497
01:05:12,981 --> 01:05:14,198
No.
- Get her!

498
01:05:14,284 --> 01:05:15,943
No. No!

499
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:17,284
No!

500
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:20,847
I'll kill you!
All of you!

501
01:05:44,913 --> 01:05:48,662
The accused has committed high treason
against this covenant.

502
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:52,066
She has consorted with animals!

503
01:05:52,152 --> 01:05:57,492
She has something to make their escape.
- I have saved this covenant many times over.

504
01:05:57,578 --> 01:06:00,014
You have killed your own kind!

505
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:06,562
And you've comingled bloodlines
resulting in the thing germinating within you.

506
01:06:06,648 --> 01:06:10,413
Your past glory does not excuse
your present guilt...

507
01:06:10,609 --> 01:06:13,725
nor does your station as a council member.

508
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:18,294
The punishment for these crimes,
is death! How vote you?

509
01:06:27,586 --> 01:06:29,378
I.

510
01:06:29,464 --> 01:06:30,762
I.
- I.

511
01:06:31,248 --> 01:06:33,899
I.
- I.

512
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:39,685
She is your daughter.

513
01:06:49,188 --> 01:06:51,012
I.

514
01:06:51,098 --> 01:06:53,082
Take her to the chamber!

515
01:06:53,445 --> 01:06:56,992
No!
You cannot do this!

516
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:02,156
Viktor!
Viktor, no!

517
01:07:02,242 --> 01:07:05,314
No, Viktor!

518
01:07:55,551 --> 01:07:57,937
No!

519
01:08:52,136 --> 01:08:54,548
Lucian!

520
01:09:21,151 --> 01:09:24,482
No, Sonya!
Just.. Just look at me!

521
01:09:24,568 --> 01:09:27,803
Keep your eyes on me.
Sonya, look at me!

522
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:38,652
I love you.

523
01:09:40,164 --> 01:09:42,880
And I love you. Your better not
be when this is over with.

524
01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:00,772
Goodbye, my love!

525
01:10:02,213 --> 01:10:04,172
No!

526
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:11,772
No!

527
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:15,782
No!

528
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:19,862
No!

529
01:10:21,648 --> 01:10:25,315
Sonya!

530
01:11:59,505 --> 01:12:02,884
My knives.
- Yes.

531
01:13:34,955 --> 01:13:37,719
My lord.

532
01:16:07,141 --> 01:16:10,435
Now go free the others.
Go!

533
01:16:18,638 --> 01:16:20,898
Follow me!

534
01:16:24,701 --> 01:16:27,140
You want your revenge?
- Yes!

535
01:16:27,226 --> 01:16:30,008
It's out there.
Now go!

536
01:16:53,854 --> 01:16:57,270
We have greater concerns
than your precious scrolls!

537
01:16:57,356 --> 01:16:59,767
Go to the elders.
Now!

538
01:17:28,867 --> 01:17:32,777
Kill that dog!

539
01:17:32,873 --> 01:17:35,193
Viktor.

540
01:18:58,443 --> 01:19:01,267
You have defiled my daughter!
- I loved her!

541
01:19:01,353 --> 01:19:04,271
You killed her!

542
01:20:14,573 --> 01:20:17,951
I should have crushed you under my heel
the day you were born.

543
01:20:18,037 --> 01:20:21,770
Yes, you should have.

544
01:20:25,709 --> 01:20:28,599
But you didn't!

545
01:21:17,209 --> 01:21:19,652
Lucian!

546
01:21:19,838 --> 01:21:22,990
Lucian!

547
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:35,746
Lucian ...

548
01:21:35,832 --> 01:21:38,550
it is finished.

549
01:21:40,345 --> 01:21:42,825
No.

550
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:46,703
This is just the beginning.

551
01:22:42,777 --> 01:22:47,300
<i> Let me tell you of something
about your beloved dark father...</i>

552
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:51,103
<i> He is the one
who killed your family...</i>

553
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:53,435
<i> not the Lycans. </i>

554
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:55,827
<i> But when he got to you ...</i>

555
01:22:55,913 --> 01:23:00,116
<i> he just couldn't bear the thought
of draining you to dry. </i>

556
01:23:00,202 --> 01:23:05,600
<i> You reminded him so much
his precious Sonya.</i>

557
01:23:06,347 --> 01:23:10,821
<i>The daughter he
condemed to death. </i>

558
01:23:10,969 --> 01:23:13,818
<i> Lies </i>
