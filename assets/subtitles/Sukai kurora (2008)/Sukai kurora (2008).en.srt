1
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,960
Look up!

2
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,130
Bogeys overhead! Pull up!

3
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,950
I'm hit! I've lost control.

4
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,180
Ejecting!

5
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,610
Look out! That's the Teacher!

6
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,490
He's on my tail!

7
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,990
Help!

8
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,430
I'm gonna kill him.

9
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,700
Hey.

10
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,540
Who are you?

11
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,540
I'm Sasakura, a mechanic here.

12
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,790
Hello, I'm Kannami Yuichi.

13
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,050
Never seen a female mechanic before?

14
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,550
No, I've seen one before.

15
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,180
Good.

16
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,810
That's the bird you'll be flying.

17
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,520
I can't fly this one?

18
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,480
The company's going to retrieve that one.

19
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,860
Aren't they the same?

20
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,860
I don't want to switch if possible.

21
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,950
You'll find out when you fly it.

22
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,700
Besides, it's an order from the boss here.

23
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,870
Who flew that bird before me?

24
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,330
Why?

25
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,910
Taking it over will require some work.

26
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,080
Then ask the boss.

27
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,180
Come in.

28
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,870
I'm Kannami Yuichi, stationed here as of today.

29
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,620
I'm Kusanagi Suito.

30
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,120
You're early.

31
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,830
I was expecting you this evening.

32
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,920
The sun was too bright.

33
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,300
Is that Camus?

34
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,590
Use room 204.

35
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,010
You'll be rooming with Tokino.

36
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,510
You'll fly with him tomorrow afternoon.

37
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,560
Um...

38
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,100
Sorry.

39
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,020
Excuse me.

40
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,930
I'm Kannami, stationed here as of today.

41
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,140
I'm Yudagawa.

42
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,890
And that's Shinoda Uroyuki.

43
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,060
How many pilots are stationed here?

44
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,110
Normally, there are three of us.

45
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,150
Including you and him?

46
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,030
Four of us including you, starting today.

47
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,280
Only four?

48
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,820
Yes, four.

49
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,030
Add the beautiful Kusanagi, and there are five who can fly.

50
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,240
She can fly as well?

51
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,000
Did he stay out all night again?

52
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,180
Who are you?

53
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,970
I'm Kannami, stationed here as of today.

54
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,680
Ah, so that's you.

55
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,730
I'm Tokino, your roommate.

56
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,810
I know.

57
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,440
I saw the room too.

58
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,070
And about us flying together tomorrow?

59
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,990
That too.

60
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,200
Then, nice meeting you.

61
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,640
You don't mean this is your first time, do you?

62
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,060
The mission? Or this bird?

63
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,270
Bird.

64
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,650
I've been flying Mark Bs since I was born.

65
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,780
Yes.

66
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,710
You tested me?

67
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,940
Now nobody thinks you're a chicken.

68
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,890
I can't see anything unusual.

69
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,730
Let's get home.

70
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,650
Roger.

71
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,690
Look out! Three birds!

72
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,110
Same height, ten o'clock!

73
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,830
Are you all right?

74
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,120
No damage.

75
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,840
How many did you kill?

76
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,210
Two.

77
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,760
Bravissimo!

78
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,780
Welcome back.

79
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,700
Thanks.

80
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,040
Hey!

81
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,290
Damage on our side?

82
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,130
Zero.

83
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,050
What about the Lautern Corps' test line?

84
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,130
It remains quiet. No movement seen.

85
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,930
All right, well done.

86
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,930
Excuse me.

87
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,140
Um... may I ask a question?

88
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,150
It's about the person who flew that bird before me.

89
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,650
His name was Kurita Jinro.

90
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,360
He was stationed here seven months ago.

91
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,620
He sortied sixty-three times.

92
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,280
He was pretty good.

93
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,290
Where did he go?

94
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,370
I can't answer that.

95
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,750
The reason he transferred?

96
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,500
Not that either.

97
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,460
Did he die?

98
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,090
Even if he did, it doesn't change your situation in any way.

99
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,090
To be present or not:

100
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,890
a person is always in one of those two states.

101
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,850
Normally, we contact the former pilot when we take over a bird, correct?

102
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,480
Of course, that's only possible if the original pilot is still alive.

103
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,770
That bird is still new.

104
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,230
I decided that there was no need for a briefing.

105
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,820
Any complaints?

106
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,030
No, I couldn't ask for a better plane.

107
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,320
Anything else?

108
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,780
Are you one of the Kildren?

109
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,920
Anything else?

110
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,420
You're also a smoker.

111
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,390
I don't trust superior officers who don't smoke.

112
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,310
For what reason?

113
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,730
Just a gut feeling, based on experience.

114
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,640
Experience...

115
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,520
That will be all.

116
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,650
Please excuse me.

117
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,670
How did you kill two birds in such a short time?

118
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,300
Flattery?

119
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,220
I don't flatter.

120
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,810
My opponents just happened to be beginners.

121
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,020
Being modest?

122
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,180
Yeah.

123
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,310
Where were you before this?

124
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,860
I don't remember.

125
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,440
Wanna go out tonight?

126
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,360
Where to?

127
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,570
I thought I'd show you around.

128
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,200
You could say it's my job.

129
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,390
What's this place?

130
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,680
They have great meat pies.

131
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,520
Aren't you hungry?

132
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,230
...appears to be an engagement.

133
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,900
Three of Lautern's twin-engine fighter aircraft, Rainbows, downed.

134
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,740
And it is reported that two pilots were killed and another was severely wounded.

135
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,270
On the evening of October fifth,

136
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:09,120
the situation on the Northern front in Europe has apparently turned more favorable for the...

137
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,960
The fight here has been rather one-sided recently,

138
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,090
so Lautern might mount a stiffer resistance.

139
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,550
Isn't she talking about your mission?

140
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,460
Congratulations.

141
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,510
I'll have a beer.

142
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,590
He'll have a meat pie and...

143
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,640
Coffee.

144
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,680
This is the place you wanted to show me?

145
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,520
This is only the first point.

146
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,690
We've got to follow a certain order.

147
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,660
I thought I'd tell you about your predecessor.

148
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,670
Mama was giving me the evil eye.

149
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,630
"Mama"?

150
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,220
You know how she looks after our birds?

151
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,720
So we call her Mama.

152
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,010
Here comes the second point.

153
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,480
Hi, Naofumi!

154
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,400
Hi!

155
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,200
This is Kannami Yuichi, a new guy at the base.

156
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,490
Hi, I'm Kusumi. Nice to meet you.

157
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,500
I'm Fuko.

158
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,090
Hi.

159
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,060
Did you like it?

160
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,100
Like what?

161
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,480
The meat pie.

162
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,980
It was delicious.

163
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,400
And it tasted somewhat familiar.

164
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,940
Come on, it'll be all right.

165
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,160
You were here a long time ago as well, right?

166
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,540
Don't know...

167
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,580
Bye, Yuichi.

168
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,960
Later.

169
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
How is Suito?

170
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,420
Is that scary girl still doing all right?

171
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,470
Let's go.

172
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,770
Have fun, bye!

173
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,710
That's a good smell.

174
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,090
Since you're here,

175
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,800
that must mean Jinro is dead.

176
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,680
I don't know.

177
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,970
I don't even know who Jinro is.

178
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,100
Do you want something to drink?

179
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,640
Coffee, if you have any.

180
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,690
What was this Jinro person like?

181
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,650
He was kind.

182
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,660
He had a gentle smile and a naïve face like you.

183
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,740
But he seemed to be hung up about something.

184
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,660
Watching him made me anxious.

185
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,250
I once asked him,

186
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,420
"Where do you always leave your heart?"

187
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,340
What did he say?

188
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,180
He didn't answer.

189
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,890
But I guessed maybe in the sky.

190
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,140
And I thought that was true.

191
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,480
How long have you been around here?

192
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,730
You have a funny way of talking to me.

193
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,820
It's funny.

194
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,990
You and I are the only ones here.

195
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,780
And listen to that.

196
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,660
You sound like a kid.

197
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,660
I <i>am</i> a kid.

198
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,290
So, do you like flying?

199
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,250
Yeah, I do.

200
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,420
Good.

201
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,430
Will you come again?

202
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,050
Yeah.

203
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,730
You'd better.

204
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,360
Welcome back.

205
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,400
Did you like it?

206
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,950
It felt just right to me.

207
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,360
I'm completely comfortable with it.

208
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,200
Of course you are.

209
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,250
My work is always perfect.

210
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,500
Jinro flew this before me, right?

211
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,710
How did he die?

212
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:41,170
Seeing that the bird's still here, he wasn't shot down, was he?

213
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,680
You should go to your room and get some rest.

214
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,680
What's up?

215
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,810
Looks like an oil leak.

216
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,020
What happened?

217
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,110
An oil leak, it seems.

218
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,190
Where's Tokino?

219
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,480
He should be back soon.

220
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,490
Identify the cause and submit a report.

221
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,530
Who are you?

222
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,200
I haven't seen you around here before.

223
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,360
I'm Kannami.

224
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,740
I'm a pilot here.

225
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,910
Kannami what?

226
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,910
Yuichi.

227
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,960
My name is Kusanagi Mizuki.

228
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,170
I'm Kusanagi Suito's younger sister.

229
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,420
Nice to meet you, Yuichi.

230
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,210
Yeah, nice to meet you.

231
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,840
What's nice about it?

232
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,550
You said it first.

233
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:18,350
I meant that it'd be nice to be friends and be able to talk.

234
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,600
Me too, for the most part.

235
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,730
Do you want something to drink?

236
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,480
Yes.

237
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,690
What brought you here?

238
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,940
School's closed today.

239
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
So I came here to play.

240
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,490
Suito said I shouldn't come, but I came anyway.

241
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:38,540
I'm exploring the place alone, so I don't get in her way.

242
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,250
Let's do something fun.

243
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,460
Like what?

244
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,920
Well...

245
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,290
What do you usually do?

246
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,880
Nothing much.

247
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,220
Nothing I can show you.

248
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,300
Any games or something?

249
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,340
Nope.

250
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,930
Even though you're a kid?

251
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:56,720
Right.

252
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,110
Are you a Kildren, Yuichi?

253
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,190
I am.

254
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:12,190
You can't grow up to be an adult, right?

255
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,110
Right.

256
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,910
Why can't you?

257
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,910
It's not that we can't. We just don't.

258
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,000
Do you want to become an adult?

259
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,960
I don't know.

260
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,040
See?

261
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,850
Wow!

262
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,100
Don't look! It'll damage your eyes!

263
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,180
Meanie!

264
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:28,690
Excuse me, can we borrow welding goggles?

265
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,400
Can we watch the sparks?

266
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,450
Niki!

267
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,740
Coming!

268
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,950
Thank you.

269
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,750
Wow, I can't see anything.

270
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,040
Boo!

271
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,300
It's dangerous, so don't come close.

272
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,590
Got it?

273
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,840
Okay!

274
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,470
Good job.

275
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,020
That took you a while.

276
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,980
Yeah.

277
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,560
Because I was finished, I did some recon.

278
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,580
That's not her sister.

279
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,290
What do you mean?

280
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,880
That's her daughter.

281
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,890
I'm back.

282
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,220
I'll hear your report later.

283
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,350
All right.

284
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,770
Thanks.

285
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,680
It's fine.

286
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,110
Watching her makes me hate myself sometimes.

287
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,450
Why is that?

288
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,290
She'll reach my age soon.

289
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,830
Then what?

290
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,460
I want to ask you a favor.

291
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,130
We're expecting tourists.

292
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,300
Can you take care of them?

293
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,720
Will I be able to?

294
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,180
I'm taking her home.

295
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,100
Okay.

296
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,060
Let's go home.

297
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,720
I hear some tourists are coming to visit?

298
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,970
They came here once before.

299
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,980
I guess they're related to our sponsor or something.

300
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,650
They're a group of people who support our company.

301
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,270
What do you think about that?

302
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,860
What do you mean?

303
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,400
The whole idea of taking a tour of the place.

304
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
Nothing much.

305
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,450
I'm sure you'll want to kill them.

306
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,580
That woman's already shot someone.

307
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,870
Which woman?

308
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,790
The one on the second floor.

309
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,040
Kusanagi did?

310
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,210
Yeah.

311
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,460
Why?

312
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,340
She always carries a gun.

313
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,860
Have you heard about Kurita Jinro?

314
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,990
What about him?

315
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,580
That woman shot him.

316
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,410
Why?

317
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,540
Here they are.

318
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,180
This is our hangar.

319
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,100
Does anyone want me to take your picture?

320
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,570
Hello, how are you?

321
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,070
Great, thank you.

322
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,820
My whole family's a big fan of yours.
 We're always cheering for your team.

323
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,120
Thank you very much.

324
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,710
Is that your plane?

325
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,330
Yes, it is.

326
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,700
What is it like?

327
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,250
What's what like?

328
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,670
I mean, how does it feel to fly?

329
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,340
Well, I don't know what to say.

330
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,800
What about when you shoot down an enemy plane?

331
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,380
I feel like a winner.

332
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,630
Don't you put a kill mark on your plane?

333
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,640
Some do, but I don't.

334
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,050
It's just like a game.

335
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,390
I know war is always horrible.

336
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,520
You're fighting for a peaceful world.

337
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,600
We really appreciate what you're doing for us.

338
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,770
It's my job.

339
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,840
It's going to crash.

340
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,170
Was the pilot from our company?

341
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,090
The bird's one of our models.

342
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,970
Perhaps it's from a neighboring war zone.

343
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:44,770
God... help... him.

344
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,610
Poor boy...

345
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,820
Enough is enough!

346
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,040
There's nothing pitiful...

347
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,500
Nothing pitiful at all!

348
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,000
Don't insult him with false sympathy!

349
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,670
Calm down.

350
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,760
It is disclosed that identification of the downed aircraft

351
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,600
is one of Rostock's Sanka-B fighters from the 502 Squadron,

352
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,730
stationed at neighboring district 202,

353
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,190
but other details are not available yet.

354
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:36,650
Public affairs officials of the company declined to answer further questions concerning this...

355
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,530
Wanna call her?

356
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,570
Call who?

357
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,700
Well, you know...

358
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,450
Oh, no.

359
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,540
I'm heading back after finishing this.

360
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,630
This is Kannami.

361
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:43,380
Where are you?

362
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,590
At the drive-in.

363
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,260
Sorry, I'm busy. I'm hanging up.

364
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,020
There are three Fortunes heading your way.

365
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:50,770
Two Fortunes.

366
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,230
No, three of them.

367
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,730
Did you see them?

368
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:53,560
Yes.

369
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,100
How long before they reach us?

370
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,150
Probably less than five minutes.

371
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,730
That gives us enough time to take a breather.

372
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,780
But you won't make it back.

373
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,990
What about my bird?

374
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,990
I'll fly it.

375
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,240
Thanks.

376
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,080
Heading back?

377
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,910
Yes, although I won't have a plane to fly.

378
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,410
Be careful.

379
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,420
About what?

380
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,510
Yuichi!

381
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,640
Yuichi!

382
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,430
Yuichi!

383
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,020
Are you guys all right?

384
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,190
We saw big planes flying.

385
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:38,940
We've already been hit.

386
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,270
What about Naofumi?

387
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:41,150
I don't know.

388
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,360
Why don't you hop in?

389
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,280
I can't leave this here.

390
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,610
It's not mine.

391
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,370
Then we'll go on ahead.

392
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:49,200
Sure.

393
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,980
Did all our birds take off okay?

394
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,730
Your bird gave me the most trouble.

395
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,900
It's flying without a spinner.

396
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,980
We didn't even have time to fuel up,
 so it might be running low on fuel by now.

397
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,650
Is Kusanagi flying it?

398
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,320
Yes.

399
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,410
That's Naofumi!

400
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:34,200
Naofumi!

401
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:39,000
We'd better send those girls back.

402
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,750
Kusanagi will scold you if she sees them.

403
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,800
Scold who?

404
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:47,130
They said you gave them permission.

405
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,680
Yuichi!

406
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,600
He seems to be doing fine, so we're heading out!

407
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,430
Bye bye, Yuichi!

408
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,550
That's not necessary.

409
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,690
Tokino's late.

410
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:42,480
I know he's all right.

411
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,400
He was circling just a minute ago.

412
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,650
He must've stopped somewhere.

413
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,410
It's me.

414
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,660
Patch me through to Field Operations.

415
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,620
Hey, you got a smoke?

416
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,220
This is Kusanagi.

417
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,680
Please let me speak to the Director.

418
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,890
Just put the Director on the phone!

419
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,140
Yes, miraculously.

420
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,100
The damage is negligible.

421
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,730
But it's only because the enemy failed.

422
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,690
Why did the message come in late?

423
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,690
That's not enough of a reason. I'm coming over.

424
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:30,690
Yudagawa!

425
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:34,740
Can you watch my desk until I return?

426
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,990
An emergency call might come in.

427
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,120
Sure, if I can eat and drink there.

428
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,910
Certainly.

429
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,460
Kannami, come with me.

430
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:54,970
Aren't we going too fast?

431
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:57,180
Sorry. I'm in that kind of mood.

432
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,190
There's Tokino.

433
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,400
I knew he'd be around here.

434
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:10,820
The road in front of the drive-in is perfect for an emergency landing,

435
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,780
so he can get a cup of coffee.

436
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:57,860
Thank you for this warm welcome.

437
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,910
Long time no see.

438
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,830
So, you won't let me inside?

439
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,580
Strange.

440
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:09,420
It's not like you suffered damage from a typhoon.

441
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,300
He's my subordinate.

442
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,590
I thought I might be too exhausted after this.

443
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:20,470
Then he can drive me back.

444
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,270
So, you must be...

445
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,100
The Director is not here at the moment.

446
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:31,940
I can tell whether or not he's really out once I see his room.

447
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:37,570
The fact that you came here is proof enough of how severe the situation really is.

448
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:40,030
I'm sure they'll realize how you feel.

449
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:42,160
Don't get me wrong.

450
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,580
I just want to see the face of the man who tried to kill me.

451
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,920
How childish...

452
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,300
This is why I hate children.

453
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,760
Oh, sorry.

454
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,470
Actually, you're right.

455
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:02,430
But do you think it's necessary for those children to grow up,

456
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,930
since they might die as soon as tomorrow?

457
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,950
Turn right at the next corner.

458
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,080
I want to make a stop.

459
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,120
Any calls?

460
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:14,380
Okay.

461
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,460
You can go and rest.

462
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,380
Thanks.

463
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,230
What is this place?

464
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,190
It's a guest room of sorts.

465
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:41,570
Employees have the right to use this place, and we need to use it once in a while.

466
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,700
Although nobody comes back here twice.

467
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:48,490
So, has everyone been here?

468
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:49,910
With you?

469
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,290
It's rare for me to come here with just one other person.

470
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,210
Why?

471
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,590
Are you hungry?

472
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,510
There's only frozen food, but I'll fix something.

473
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,950
How can you eat that stuff?

474
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:26,070
Why?

475
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:28,240
It's pretty disgusting.

476
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,330
But it's made from edible ingredients, right?

477
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,840
Are you going back?

478
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,470
You can stay here tonight.

479
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:07,200
Did Jinro spend a night here as well?

480
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,030
Yes.

481
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:11,740
Why?

482
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,790
Yudagawa said something strange.

483
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,130
That you killed Jinro.

484
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,680
Do you...

485
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,350
want me to kill you too?

486
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:01,710
Five minutes to bingo fuel.

487
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,670
Let's go home.

488
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:08,010
Turn right to 160.

489
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,630
Maintain this height.

490
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,060
Look out! Bogeys!

491
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,400
Two o'clock behind. Two bombers.

492
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,820
They got escorts.

493
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,740
Twins?

494
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,700
One is a prop forward. Maybe J-Zwei.

495
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,290
Are you sure?

496
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,080
Wanna bet?

497
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,960
I'll check it out.

498
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,580
You head home.

499
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,840
By yourself?

500
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,670
No way! Come back, Westy!

501
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:54,510
Westy, come in. Where are you?

502
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:56,680
Confirmed. It's a J-Zwei.

503
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,560
A black panther on the nose.

504
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,730
It's Teacher!

505
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,730
Teacher?!

506
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,110
Pull back, Cairn!

507
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,680
Westy, are you all right?

508
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,050
Where are you?

509
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:36,220
Come in!

510
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,220
Answer me!

511
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:20,180
Yudagawa said it was Teacher?

512
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:20,930
Yes.

513
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,440
That's all.

514
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,400
It happened over the sea.

515
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,700
The plane sank in no time.

516
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,740
Did you see it?

517
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:25,540
Skily wasn't used to flying around here.

518
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:32,000
Perhaps he wanted to see for himself whether the bird you saw really was Teacher.

519
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,630
Who's this Teacher?

520
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:37,170
Once you see him in the sky, you don't come back alive.

521
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:42,310
He's the ace pilot of Lautern Corps.

522
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:48,140
Maybe he's been reassigned here because we've been beating them too easily.

523
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:50,480
It's entirely possible.

524
00:57:58,530 --> 00:57:59,700
Teacher...

525
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,540
I've heard a rumor that he's not like us.

526
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,460
He's an adult.

527
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,540
Even though he's a fighter pilot?

528
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:14,920
Yeah.

529
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:18,880
An adult male.

530
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,260
An adult male...

531
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,460
Any word?

532
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,840
None.

533
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:50,970
I told her that we should head back.

534
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:53,810
The weather was getting bad, and we were starting to run low on fuel as well.

535
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,680
She agreed with me.

536
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,930
Then why?

537
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:02,020
She broke formation when she saw an enemy bird.

538
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:04,480
Since then, she hasn't come back yet...

539
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,980
You shouldn't have any beer.

540
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:09,070
We may have to fly search-and-rescue.

541
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,200
It was Teacher!

542
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,280
You saw the black panther markings?

543
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,410
If we were close enough to see that, I'd have stayed behind too!

544
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:20,250
Why is she so adamant about Teacher?

545
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,670
Ask her when she returns.

546
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,420
If she manages to, that is.

547
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,460
Out of my way!

548
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,300
Call a doctor! And an ambulance!

549
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,920
Bring blankets!

550
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,060
I guess she crashed near our place.

551
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,060
Thank you.

552
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:04,350
I've seen her in that state once before.

553
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:11,860
Her heart apparently intact, yet crushed inside.

554
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:18,740
She visited our place once before.

555
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,330
To see my client.

556
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,250
She chased me out, and then stayed in there for hours.

557
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:50,860
She's not stable.

558
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,410
What are you looking at?!

559
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:58,450
Stay outside!

560
01:04:58,450 --> 01:04:59,120
Yes!

561
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:09,500
Got a smoke?

562
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,050
I'm sorry to cause trouble.

563
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:22,390
Tell that to everyone too.

564
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,940
She's only lost consciousness.

565
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:29,730
I didn't see any damage to her bones or internal organs,

566
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:32,400
so it's best to let her sleep until the doctor gets here.

567
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:35,780
I heard a large-scale operation is coming up.

568
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:38,950
We'll probably move the base as well.

569
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:40,450
Move?

570
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:42,780
I'm sure it's a temporary measure.

571
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:47,370
She probably wanted to settle the matter before leaving this area.

572
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:55,840
Sasakura, you've been with Kusanagi for a long time, haven't you?

573
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,300
And?

574
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,010
That girl named Mizuki...

575
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:02,390
Could the father of Kusanagi's daughter be...

576
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,100
I'll stay with her until the doctor gets here.

577
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,520
You should go and rest.

578
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:25,950
No matter where we go, the guys are always the same.

579
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:32,790
It's rare to see someone who makes me think,
 "I've never met anyone like this."

580
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:35,540
Aren't twin pilots rare?

581
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:38,290
I've seen a few before.

582
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:42,300
And it's rare for one to return from a mission without the other.

583
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:52,430
What are you guys doing?

584
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,940
Those are for kids.

585
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,940
I'm a kid too.

586
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:07,280
Is the man named Kannami still at the party?

587
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:09,660
I don't think so.

588
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:11,160
Then he went to his room?

589
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,410
I don't think so.

590
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:18,460
Are you Kannami?

591
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:19,630
Yeah.

592
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:22,000
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

593
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,420
You didn't ask me.

594
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,760
What a bummer.

595
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,680
You're nothing like I imagined.

596
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,270
I'm Tokino.

597
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,180
Am I different from what you imagined?

598
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:38,600
I'm Mitsuya. Nice to meet you.

599
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,690
Nice to meet you!

600
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,270
I can't wait for tomorrow.

601
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:57,160
What's up with that woman?

602
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:17,850
She was pretty good.

603
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:18,810
Who was?

604
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:20,770
That woman from last night.

605
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:21,850
Oh.

606
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,400
She's the ace here.

607
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,820
Oh.

608
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:28,490
Female aces are a pain.

609
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:31,240
I think male aces are a pain as well.

610
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:36,740
I don't care about men.

611
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:38,710
You're our ace.

612
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:41,670
I heard Kusanagi was quite something too.

613
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,670
Oh man, God help me.

614
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:48,760
Oh well, you're free to do your thing.

615
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:50,510
What?

616
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,100
I mean, do whatever you want!

617
01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:04,150
You'll be participating in an operation of unprecedented proportions.

618
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:10,190
The target is Lautern Corps' largest stronghold, located in the central theater of operations.

619
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:15,580
First, eight fighters, flown by you, will take off from this base.

620
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:19,410
Units from other bases will gradually join these fighters,

621
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:22,040
and by the end, the force will total eighty fighters.

622
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:26,540
In addition, there will be thirty medium bombers and twenty heavy bombers at higher altitudes.

623
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,090
This will be Team B.

624
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:33,340
Team A, comprised of forty fighters and fifty ground-support craft,

625
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:38,600
will attack the two forward bases before your arrival.

626
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:40,770
Any questions?

627
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:46,110
May I ask something, although it's not related to the battle?

628
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:47,320
Go ahead.

629
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,320
Will the party tonight be canceled?

630
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,320
Another party?

631
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,530
The local children come here every other month for a party,

632
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:57,450
and it's being held tonight.

633
01:11:57,450 --> 01:12:00,370
Sorry. I didn't know that.

634
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:01,950
We are not canceling it.

635
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,830
This operation is top secret.

636
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:07,000
We can't announce a cancellation now.

637
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:11,380
Kusanagi, anything to add?

638
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:15,050
The battle will most likely take place over the sea.

639
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:20,520
The enemy will definitely react
 after their front bases are attacked.

640
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:25,850
They can't use anti-aircraft weapons if their own birds are in the area.

641
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,480
They'll resist, even if it's futile.

642
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:31,940
It'll be an unusually lengthy operation for a fighter plane squadron.

643
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:36,110
Because of their short range,
 the Sankas will have to refuel in mid-air.

644
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:38,910
Don't drop the extra tanks until the last minute.

645
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:40,410
That's all.

646
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,540
Report to the runway in twenty minutes.

647
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:55,540
Rostock, contracted war-bird company for the European Confederation,

648
01:14:55,540 --> 01:15:00,300
began long-range raids against the strategically vital facilities of its opponent, Lautern.

649
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,430
It is expected that more large-scale engagements will ensue.

650
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,390
The strength of the attacking force is,
 according to the statement by Rostock,

651
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:10,600
three squadrons of heavy bombers from the Strategic Bombardment Wing,

652
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,860
escorted by fighters from eight squadrons and four tactical squadrons.

653
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:38,630
Fighter control, flight sixty zero zero to waypoint one.

654
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:44,470
Estimated time of contact correction: ten zero zero minus zero five.

655
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:48,220
Repeat. Ten zero zero minus zero five.

656
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:53,600
Fighter squadrons Able, Baker, Charlie, stay on your altitude.

657
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:12,580
Whale, fly and evacuate.

658
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,770
Warning! Enemies in sight!

659
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:34,890
Altitude eighty zero zero.

660
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,060
Fighters contact, engage at will.

661
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,940
All weapons ready.

662
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:40,480
Let's dance!

663
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,250
Control to everyone.

664
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:01,000
Evacuate battle area.

665
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,830
Repeat. Evacuate battle area.

666
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:08,760
Cairn, where are you?

667
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,800
Altitude thirty zero zero. Turning left to join.

668
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:14,760
Confirmed.

669
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,560
Joining aft left. Turn, turn.

670
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,930
Where's Sturdy?

671
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:20,230
Not sure.

672
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:23,730
Sturdy, come in. This is Cairn.

673
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:25,560
I get no answer.

674
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:27,570
Mission complete.

675
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:29,150
RTB, everyone.

676
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:32,150
Repeat. Return to base, everyone.

677
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:36,390
Rostock's big offensive that had started at ten o'clock this morning

678
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:40,160
met with an unexpectedly fierce and effective interception from Lautern

679
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,880
and fell into a total confusion,
 inflicting heavy casualties to both sides.

680
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:50,670
The engagement has seemed to be halted as a recommendation was hastily issued from the European Confederation.

681
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:54,800
We will report the precise figures of losses and casualties of both conflicting companies

682
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,680
as soon as the Conflict Control Committee will—

683
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,620
Master!

684
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:26,290
Where are you?

685
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:27,580
Master?

686
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,230
They lost a lot too.

687
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,230
Did you see them go down?

688
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,320
Which side?

689
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:05,750
Skily came up from below Kishinuma's bird,

690
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:08,710
and just when he had almost caught up with Kishinuma,

691
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:11,130
he made a sudden half-roll,

692
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:14,710
climbed like this, then went into a stall turn,

693
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:18,140
let Kumatake's bird fly by as it was trying to catch up,

694
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:22,100
made a snappy turn, went after him from above and behind...

695
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,520
He was shot down at point-blank range.

696
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,850
A similar maneuver probably took out Shinoda's Sanka.

697
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,150
The enemy was a bird with black panther markings.

698
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:39,410
Let's go out on the town after this.

699
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:56,880
Are there any clubs here?

700
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:00,890
Let's get off at the next stop.

701
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:12,040
They close early.

702
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,630
It's not that late yet.

703
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:16,590
I guess it's a small town.

704
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:19,800
What does that look like?

705
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:33,140
What a coincidence.

706
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,940
Bowling?

707
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:38,780
I thought they might at least serve beer.

708
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:42,950
Close!

709
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:45,700
Let's go for a spare!

710
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:23,320
What's she up to?

711
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,700
Tokino.

712
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:59,700
Hey, he plays pretty cool. Come join us!

713
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,980
Come here, come!

714
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:04,280
Maybe he'll come...

715
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,530
Your turn, Kannami.

716
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:32,650
Where do we go next?

717
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:33,680
Where are you taking us?

718
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,550
Later!

719
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:35,810
Bye!

720
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:35,810
You play great.

721
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:43,760
I want to line those types of girls up, and then mow 'em down with a ball.

722
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,860
Do you want to continue?

723
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:51,550
Let's ask the staff to recommend a better place and drink some more.

724
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,930
I can't drink any more.

725
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,260
I'll drink.

726
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:28,570
Why were you so reckless the other day?

727
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:32,700
Is it because you saw the black panther markings?

728
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:37,750
He used to be with our company.

729
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:38,580
Oh?

730
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:41,620
You said that tactfully.

731
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:43,880
He was my superior.

732
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:47,920
As a pilot, he's special.

733
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:50,800
He's a normal adult.

734
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,390
A grown man.

735
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,390
Why did he join the other company?

736
01:26:56,890 --> 01:27:01,020
He quit this company after some trouble.

737
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,440
Will shooting down Teacher change something?

738
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:09,690
Like our fate, our limits, or something.

739
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:12,410
Maybe.

740
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:16,160
But nobody can shoot him down.

741
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,030
Why?

742
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:23,420
Who do you think we're fighting?

743
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:24,330
I don't know.

744
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:25,880
I've never even thought about that.

745
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,920
Even though we're killing each other?

746
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,090
It's our job.

747
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,090
It's the same, no matter what business we're in.

748
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,640
Whoever shoves the competition hardest and earns the most profit wins.

749
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:42,940
Compared to normal companies, what we're doing is an inefficient and old-fashioned game.

750
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:44,060
Yes.

751
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:48,360
Because it's a game, we can kill and be killed legally.

752
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:50,570
That's an interesting notion.

753
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:51,900
Interesting?

754
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:58,330
No matter the era, war has never been completely eradicated,

755
01:27:58,330 --> 01:28:03,000
because the reality of it has always been important to humans.

756
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:08,090
The reality of someone fighting somewhere, even now,

757
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:11,920
is a necessity in the human social system.

758
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,010
And that need can never be fulfilled by lies.

759
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:21,970
It's not enough to read what wars are like in textbook stories.

760
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:26,940
The reality of people dying, the reports of that news on the TV:

761
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:31,650
we can't maintain peace without seeing those tragedies.

762
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:34,070
We would cease to understand the meaning of peace.

763
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:40,660
Just as we don't feel alive unless we kill each other in the sky.

764
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:47,880
And as long as our war is just a game that must never end,

765
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,170
rules are a necessity.

766
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,920
For example, the existence of an enemy we can never defeat.

767
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:58,800
And that's Teacher?

768
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:30,080
Haven't you had too much?

769
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:51,440
What are you looking at?

770
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,700
Get lost! Get lost!

771
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:18,700
Go away!

772
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:31,400
Do you want me to kill you?

773
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,400
Or would you kill me?

774
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:43,780
Otherwise, we'll be like this forever.

775
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,660
Only two have returned.

776
01:32:12,370 --> 01:32:15,790
We'll have a hybrid squadron including Someakas starting today?

777
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:18,000
Their engines are kinda flaky.

778
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,920
I assigned Rokuta, Haga, and Niki, who have experience with twin engines, to that duty.

779
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:59,080
Hey, you there!

780
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,130
What?

781
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,930
Who's that kid?

782
01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:09,220
That's Kusanagi's daughter.

783
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:10,430
Daughter?

784
01:33:10,430 --> 01:33:13,100
Who on earth is the father?

785
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:15,020
There are lots of rumors about her.

786
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:49,930
Who are you?

787
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:53,970
I'm a pilot stationed here.

788
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:55,430
I'm Kannami.

789
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:56,680
I'm Aihara.

790
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,640
How many pilots are here?

791
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:01,730
Seven, including you and the boss, I think.

792
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:02,310
I see.

793
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:24,290
Yes?

794
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:25,500
Well...

795
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,550
I just remembered someone who used to fold his newspaper like that.

796
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:29,590
I see.

797
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,430
Sasakura...

798
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:43,600
How long have you been with Kusanagi?

799
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,020
Well, eight years, I think.

800
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:50,570
Then you know about the days when she was an ace.

801
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:51,860
Yes.

802
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,490
Is it okay for her to end up like that?

803
01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:57,950
What do you mean "like that"?

804
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:02,290
She's a wreck.

805
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:06,670
To me, she appears to be doing her work normally.

806
01:37:06,670 --> 01:37:08,630
She had a child.

807
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:10,250
And?

808
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,210
A child had a child!

809
01:37:12,210 --> 01:37:13,170
And?

810
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:14,130
Don't you see?

811
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:15,130
No, I don't.

812
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:17,840
Everyone pretends like they don't see it.

813
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,300
They pretend not to know about it.

814
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:22,930
Even the company must know about her child.

815
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:23,930
Kusanagi is...

816
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,690
She was an excellent ace,

817
01:37:30,690 --> 01:37:34,440
so she survived and lived a little longer than everyone else.

818
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:38,320
She saw and thought much more than everyone else,

819
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:42,700
and learned to interfere with her fate and the fate of others.

820
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:47,040
To kill her own loved one? Was that a part of her interference too?

821
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,710
Don't you see?

822
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:49,710
No, I don't!

823
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:13,690
Let's go out, Kannami.

824
01:38:13,690 --> 01:38:15,110
To Kusumi's?

825
01:38:15,110 --> 01:38:16,320
Yeah.

826
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,030
Say hi to Fuko.

827
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:32,170
Who is it?

828
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:33,290
Who is what?

829
01:38:33,290 --> 01:38:36,760
Who's going out with Mr. Kannami tonight?

830
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:41,220
If it's Kusanagi, don't go.

831
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:45,760
And don't tell me it's Mitsuya.

832
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:49,140
Don't go, for your own sake.

833
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:52,060
What's so dangerous about them?

834
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:54,980
It's obvious. If you sleep with Kusanagi,

835
01:38:54,980 --> 01:38:59,360
she'll shoot you in the head, and it'll be bye-bye.

836
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,450
And Mitsuya?

837
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:04,030
She's like an inescapable vortex.

838
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,030
Any other advice?

839
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:12,170
I won't kneel down and beg you,

840
01:39:12,170 --> 01:39:15,090
but this is my best advice as a friend.

841
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:17,840
Be careful tonight.

842
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:18,760
Thanks.

843
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:34,940
Come in.

844
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:37,770
Do you have a minute?

845
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:44,530
I only have coffee.

846
01:39:44,530 --> 01:39:46,620
If you want some, there's some left in the pot on the table.

847
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:10,180
I'm relieved.

848
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:12,100
I thought you'd gone out.

849
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:13,980
Tokino did.

850
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:15,900
Went to play with grown-up women?

851
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:16,730
Yes.

852
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:18,650
Why did you stay?

853
01:40:19,230 --> 01:40:20,570
I had a hunch.

854
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,780
That I'd visit you?

855
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:25,780
I'm not that conceited.

856
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:28,700
Just a hunch that I should stay in my room tonight.

857
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,790
And I'm usually right.

858
01:40:30,790 --> 01:40:35,330
How long has it been since you were assigned here?

859
01:40:35,330 --> 01:40:38,290
Well, maybe since the end of the summer.

860
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:39,380
What about before that?

861
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:41,300
How many hours on your flight log?

862
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:43,880
How many years since you became a fighter pilot?

863
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:46,470
You came to talk about stuff like that?

864
01:40:47,590 --> 01:40:49,930
I trust you the most of all the people on this base,

865
01:40:49,930 --> 01:40:54,980
so I want to ask how you deal with your emotions.

866
01:40:54,980 --> 01:41:00,060
Like how you deal with the memories of the past and present when everything repeats itself.

867
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:04,610
I'm just guessing, but we become very forgetful,

868
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:09,120
and are protected by the vagueness of our memories, as if we're in a dream.

869
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:14,000
We can't differentiate what happened yesterday, last month, or last year.

870
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,500
They all feel the same.

871
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,040
Am I right?

872
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,630
That's about right for me.

873
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:23,250
It's been like that ever since I was young.

874
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:28,180
People have told me that I always look spaced out and that they can't tell if I'm awake or asleep.

875
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:30,300
And you can't tell yourself?

876
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:36,270
Did you know that "Kildren" used to be the name of a product our company made?

877
01:41:36,270 --> 01:41:40,770
You were born suddenly in the process of developing a DNA manipulation drug,

878
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:45,650
and the name that was intended for that new drug became the word to describe your kind.

879
01:41:45,650 --> 01:41:47,780
You're saying you're different?

880
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:50,240
You Kildren don't age.

881
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,160
You live forever.

882
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:54,330
Nobody knew that at first.

883
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:56,290
They didn't believe it even after they found out.

884
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:58,920
But then rumors started spreading...

885
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,710
that there were people who wouldn't die unless they were killed in battle.

886
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:05,380
I can't tell!

887
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:07,510
Am I a Kildren?

888
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:12,760
I don't know where I heard or read what I just told you. Is it really true?

889
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:16,810
Everything feels fragmented.

890
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:20,100
I'm not confident that I've been through any particular experience.

891
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:22,150
I have no tangible feelings whatsoever.

892
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:28,990
Wouldn't it be too much if I were the only one who's not a Kildren?

893
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:31,280
How long have I been flying?

894
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:34,120
How long have I been killing people?

895
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:37,700
How and when did I become like this?

896
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:39,370
I wonder that every night.

897
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:42,080
I can't remember.

898
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:44,290
I can't remember.

899
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,090
I try and try,

900
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:51,510
but I can't remember anything from my childhood except for a specific scene.

901
01:43:06,110 --> 01:43:08,990
Apparently you liked to play with kids.

902
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:14,450
I met a volunteer worker at the last base,

903
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:17,450
and I was just providing a place and giving her my help.

904
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:20,620
I like watching children.

905
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:23,580
I wish that I'd had a childhood too.

906
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:28,800
Because maybe I was born just as I am now.

907
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:34,260
When I think that maybe I've never grown up,
 I feel like I'm walking on air.

908
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:35,470
Don't you feel the same?

909
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:37,930
Don't you get anxious?

910
01:43:39,810 --> 01:43:47,190
Perhaps the reason Kusanagi shot this Jinro guy was that she wanted to end things for him.

911
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:51,740
But he didn't die.

912
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:53,400
He didn't?

913
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,860
Because he turned into you.

914
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:58,280
You regenerated as another person.

915
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:01,700
They gave you a new memory and thus created you.

916
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:04,620
You are the reincarnation of Jinro.

917
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:09,500
Because they'd lose his know-how as a pilot if they didn't.

918
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:12,340
Because they'd lose his quality as a weapon.

919
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:16,140
Why don't people realize that?

920
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:18,100
They're just pretending that they don't.

921
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:21,930
They'll pretend that they don't know until you realize it.

922
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:24,190
That's an interesting notion.

923
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:26,230
How was the coffee?

924
01:44:29,570 --> 01:44:31,030
It was good.

925
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:32,360
Thanks.

926
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:33,650
Likewise.

927
01:44:33,650 --> 01:44:35,360
That was an interesting story.

928
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,410
Thanks.

929
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:11,230
What's your reason?

930
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:16,780
You'd better put away the gun.

931
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:21,950
Or would you give it to me?

932
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:24,330
This is my gun!

933
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:27,540
Then let me borrow it.

934
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:28,580
Why?!

935
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:34,510
I'll shoot Kusanagi instead of you.

936
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:37,470
Good idea.

937
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:09,540
Leave the room, Mitsuya.

938
01:46:12,330 --> 01:46:14,420
Die if you want to!

939
01:46:34,230 --> 01:46:36,360
May I smoke?

940
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,440
Go ahead.

941
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:40,030
This is your room.

942
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,200
Did you kill Kurita Jinro?

943
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:46,870
Yeah.

944
01:46:50,290 --> 01:46:52,040
He asked you to kill him?

945
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:52,920
Yeah.

946
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:55,380
Did you love him?

947
01:46:58,260 --> 01:46:59,130
Yeah.

948
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:02,180
Kannami,

949
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:07,140
shoot me with that gun.

950
01:47:07,810 --> 01:47:09,560
Should I kill you?

951
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:10,480
Yes.

952
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,400
It's your turn to kill me.

953
01:47:15,110 --> 01:47:16,270
Please.

954
01:47:34,210 --> 01:47:37,960
You must live until you can change something.

955
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:37,720
Even on the path we walk everyday, we can step on different spots.

956
01:50:39,390 --> 01:50:43,060
Just because it's the same path doesn't mean it always has the same scenery.

957
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:47,030
Isn't that good enough?

958
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:50,700
Or is that not enough...

959
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:53,570
because that's all there is?

960
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:03,330
Warning! Enemy in sight.

961
01:51:03,330 --> 01:51:05,040
Two o'clock, same height.

962
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,750
It's... J-Zwei!

963
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:08,010
Everyone, retreat.

964
01:51:10,970 --> 01:51:13,090
Cairn! What are you doing?!

965
01:51:13,090 --> 01:51:13,930
Get back!

966
01:51:14,510 --> 01:51:16,350
I'm gonna cover you.

967
01:51:16,350 --> 01:51:17,140
Quit it!

968
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:19,980
This is my battle.

969
01:51:24,270 --> 01:51:29,230
Just because it's the same path doesn't mean it always has the same scenery.

970
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:32,950
Isn't that... good enough?

971
01:51:36,450 --> 01:51:38,200
I'll kill my father.

972
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:29,330
Come in.

973
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:41,760
I'm Hiiragi Isamu, stationed here as of today.

974
02:01:45,930 --> 02:01:47,480
I'm Kusanagi Suito.

975
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:49,850
I've been expecting you.
