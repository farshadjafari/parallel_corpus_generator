1
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,761
I was orphaned at an early age

2
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,630
I had no name,
so people called me Nameless

3
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,966
Being a nobody,
I studied swordsmanship

4
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,272
After 10 years of practice

5
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,411
I acquired a unique skill

6
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,244
The King of Qin has summoned me

7
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,042
My deeds have astonished the Kingdom

8
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,818
By order of His Majesty

9
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,120
we have brought the mighty warrior

10
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,746
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword

11
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,711
the three assassins from Zhao

12
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,516
have sought His Majesty's life
for 10 years

13
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:15,023
His Majesty has known no peace

14
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,890
To the astonishment of all

15
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,830
a mighty warrior of Qin
has smashed them

16
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:27,103
His Majesty can finally sleep at night!

17
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,036
We rejoice for our King!

18
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,837
This warrior sent from Heaven

19
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,046
has exterminated the assassins

20
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,067
Summon the warrior!

21
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,537
Remain 100 paces from His Majesty

22
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,238
Or you will be executed.
Never forget that

23
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,844
No one is allowed
within 100 paces of me

24
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,180
Do you know why?

25
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,054
To guard against assassins

26
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,826
Yes. That's why I am confined
in this armor

27
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,964
You have removed a great peril for me

28
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,327
How should I reward you?

29
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,099
My service was for Qin, not for a reward

30
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,367
Achievements must be rewarded

31
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,503
Sky's silver spear...

32
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,847
wounded many of my brave warriors

33
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,579
Announce my edict!

34
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:57,981
By order of His Majesty

35
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:02,491
he who kills Sky
will receive gold and land

36
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,993
and be allowed to drink

37
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,630
within 20 paces of His Majesty

38
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,686
I am informed you're a citizen of Qin

39
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,356
I am a Prefect from Leng Meng County

40
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,551
A County Prefect over 10 square miles!

41
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,923
Surely the lowest-ranking official in Qin

42
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:43,291
How did you defeat such opponents?

43
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,896
I took them on one by one

44
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,064
Tell me the details

45
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,599
Does Your Majesty know

46
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,139
Flying Snow and Broken Sword were lovers?

47
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,844
Yes, I do

48
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,945
And that they hadn't spoken
for three years?

49
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,647
For three years? Why?

50
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,786
Flying Snow had an affair with Sky

51
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,584
Broken Sword never forgave her

52
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,289
Why haven't I heard this before?

53
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,955
I went to great lengths to uncover it

54
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,600
To divide Flying Snow and Broken Sword

55
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,559
I first needed to eliminate Sky

56
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,839
I have an idea of what you planned

57
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,507
Your Majesty is wise

58
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,136
What did you use to defeat Sky?

59
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,504
The sword

60
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,640
I must arrest criminals in my county

61
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,943
On the fifth day of the sixth month

62
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,687
Sky attended a chess house

63
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,149
I had learnt he enjoyed playing chess

64
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,188
and listening to music there

65
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,407
So, the seven masters of Qin Palace

66
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,148
We are here to arrest you!

67
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,053
Identify yourself by showing your spear

68
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:02,965
Halt!

69
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,606
What can a minor official do?

70
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,781
This is my territory

71
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,250
So?

72
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,417
You are on the King's most wanted list

73
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,183
I am placing you under arrest

74
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,145
Old man, please play one more tune

75
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,542
Martial arts and music are different

76
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,482
but they share the same principle

77
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,745
Both stress attaining a supreme state

78
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:40,088
Sky and I faced each other
for a long time

79
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,191
Neither of us moved

80
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:47,088
We fought the battle in our minds

81
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,869
How swift thy sword!

82
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:45,170
I thought I knew everything
about my Kingdom

83
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,039
I didn't know that Leng Meng County

84
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,510
held a talent like yours

85
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,646
Broken Sword

86
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,486
Flying Snow

87
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,127
By order of His Majesty!

88
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,989
Flying Snow and Broken Sword

89
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,789
have teamed up for assassination

90
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,524
He who kills either of them

91
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,397
will receive gold and land

92
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,696
and be allowed to drink

93
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,533
within 10 paces of His Majesty

94
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,227
Three years ago, Flying Snow

95
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,862
stormed the palace with Broken Sword

96
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,728
3000 elite troops couldn't stop them

97
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,939
I've since emptied the palace

98
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,631
so assassins cannot hide

99
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,205
Was your sword swifter
than theirs combined?

100
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,408
No

101
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,351
How did you do it, then?

102
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,664
Disguised as a citizen of Zhao

103
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,298
I sought them in the Kingdom of Zhao

104
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,062
I learned they were hiding

105
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,868
in a calligraphy school

106
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,970
under the names Highcliff and Springbrook

107
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,307
Rumor had it

108
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,445
the Qin army would attack that day

109
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,010
Most of the townspeople had fled

110
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,210
Only the school's students remained

111
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,552
Why have you come at such a time?

112
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,779
Who are you?

113
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,987
I'm from Yi County
in the Kingdom of Zhao

114
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,523
My father's dying wish

115
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,657
was for one of your scrolls

116
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,297
I fear this may be our school's last day

117
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,366
Which calligrapher do you seek?

118
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,299
I respectfully request Master Highcliff

119
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,939
Highcliff was Broken Sword

120
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,767
Legend said his skill as a swordsman

121
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,276
was rooted in his calligraphy

122
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,478
So I had my concerns

123
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,013
I needed to find out if it was true

124
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:10,914
What do you want written?

125
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,284
"Sword. "

126
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,352
You are fond of the sword?

127
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,865
It was my father's dying wish

128
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,270
What size scroll?

129
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,435
Eight feet

130
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,649
For that size I will need red ink

131
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,211
My master has asked me

132
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,689
to borrow some red ink

133
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,419
My master wants to borrow some red ink

134
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,967
Did you hear me, Master Springbrook?

135
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,866
Master Highcliff wants to borrow red ink

136
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,440
Tell him to come himself

137
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,093
Could I have some red ink?

138
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,541
The character "sword"
was still being written

139
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,382
when Your Majesty's troops

140
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,608
arrived at the city gates

141
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,456
Draw!

142
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,601
Your Majesty's army is invincible

143
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,241
not only because it is brave

144
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,342
but also because of its archery

145
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,443
with a greater range than any other army

146
00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:00,448
The Qin archers are like artillery

147
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,087
intimidating the enemy

148
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,369
Hail! Hail! Hail!

149
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,747
Please remember

150
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,807
their arrows might destroy our town

151
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,783
and topple our Kingdom

152
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,688
but they can never
obliterate our culture

153
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,386
Today

154
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:21,098
you will learn the essence of our culture

155
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,396
Hail! Hail! Hail!

156
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,884
Those Zhao people didn't flee?

157
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,087
They drew strength from their calligraphy

158
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,915
What was so difficult about "sword"?

159
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,752
There are 19 different ways to write it

160
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,426
I asked Broken Sword

161
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,530
for a 20th way

162
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,787
Both calligraphy and swordplay

163
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,365
rely on one's strength and spirit

164
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,591
The 20th style would reveal

165
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,863
the essence of his swordsmanship

166
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,075
How odd to write it in 19 ways

167
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,001
It makes the written language

168
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,809
impossible to comprehend

169
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,582
Once I've conquered the six Kingdoms

170
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,250
and all the northern tribes

171
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,979
I will eradicate this problem

172
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,314
by mandating one style of writing

173
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,957
Wouldn't that be ideal?

174
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,252
Your Majesty won't stop
at the six Kingdoms?

175
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,258
The six Kingdoms are nothing!

176
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,156
I will lead my army to conquer vast lands

177
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,299
and establish a great empire

178
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,874
Hail! Hail! Hail!

179
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,775
Master Springbrook

180
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,377
Why are you going outside?

181
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,012
To fend off the arrows

182
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,412
You aren't needed. Stay inside

183
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,923
The Qin archers are powerful

184
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,094
You alone may not stop them

185
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,428
Hail! Hail! Hail!

186
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,609
You are good

187
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,547
You are even better

188
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,481
You didn't come here for calligraphy

189
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,249
Who are you?

190
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:45,153
I've travelled here to deliver an item

191
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,092
Please meet me in the library at midnight

192
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,760
Great calligraphy

193
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,259
Great swordplay

194
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,799
You didn't even see my swordplay

195
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,738
I couldn't have written without it

196
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,136
At midnight

197
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,507
meet me in the library

198
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,883
Several hundred thousand Qin troops

199
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:17,644
were readying for the next onslaught

200
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,157
I studied the character all night

201
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,159
trying to unlock the secret of his skills

202
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,900
It would reveal his swordsmanship?

203
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,840
But it's just an ordinary word

204
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,045
Calligraphy and swordplay are similar

205
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,079
One must comprehend their true essence

206
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,281
Did you discover it?

207
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,851
It eluded me

208
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:57,059
So how did you challenge them?

209
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:01,124
Although they hadn't spoken in three
years They spied on each other

210
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:02,822
At midnight

211
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,299
Broken Sword would peek into
Flying Snow's room

212
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,541
At 2 o'clock in the morning

213
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,975
she would spy on Broken Sword

214
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,816
What strange behaviour

215
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:29,560
I was surprised too

216
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:33,525
So I used Sky's silver
spear to get to them

217
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,535
Sky died by your sword?

218
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:45,741
Yes

219
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,476
Who are you? Why are you here?

220
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,349
I'm from the Kingdom of Qin

221
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,348
I have a message from Sky

222
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,718
Go on

223
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,885
He said he had lived a life

224
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,923
without responsibilities or commitments

225
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,059
He cared for only one person

226
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,261
Who?

227
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,688
Flying Snow

228
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,944
Sky was certain she'd avenge his death

229
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:35,689
To fight, meet me at the Qin camp

230
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:57,825
You can leave now

231
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,536
Go!

232
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,577
I know you saw us!

233
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,142
Let me tell you

234
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,648
we've been together for three years

235
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,257
I let you see us on purpose!

236
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,928
I no longer care about you at all!

237
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,969
We were both very foolish

238
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,008
I just wanted you to care about me

239
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,981
I'm not going to fight you

240
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,184
Go away!

241
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,726
I will kill you in honor of my master!

242
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,281
You ask to die. I will help you.

243
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,067
Why do you laugh?

244
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,535
What you did last night was stupid

245
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,980
My plan proved successful

246
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,212
When Flying Snow was fighting me

247
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,354
she was disturbed and disoriented

248
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,692
I defeated her easily

249
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:07,774
I never imagined supreme warriors

250
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,742
like Broken Sword and Flying Snow

251
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,744
allowing their emotions
to be a liability

252
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:33,169
It sounds as if you did divide them

253
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,300
Yes

254
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:35,832
In that case, they must have been

255
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,009
petty and narrow-minded

256
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,165
True

257
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:43,107
Your story sounds logical

258
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,372
But

259
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,482
you have underestimated one person.

260
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:49,715
Who?

261
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:51,653
Me

262
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:56,024
Would you like my impression of them?

263
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,591
Three years ago they stormed the palace

264
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,862
I was impressed

265
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,459
by their valor and dignity

266
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,465
Their character could not be petty

267
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,735
So Flying Snow's affair with Sky is a lie

268
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:11,534
Their betrayal of one another is a lie

269
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,710
The story you just told is a lie!

270
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:21,178
Except for one thing

271
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,121
Sky did know one of you

272
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,314
Who?

273
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:29,818
You

274
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,890
I surmise you two were old friends

275
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,467
And Sky's defeat has only one explanation

276
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,658
What's that?

277
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,167
He permitted it

278
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,071
To kill me, the two of you formed a pact

279
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:55,183
using my men as witnesses

280
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,444
That was not hard to arrange

281
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,918
The hardest part was to persuade Sky

282
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,421
to put his life in your hands

283
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,424
You were not fast enough to defeat Sky

284
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,359
He died willingly under your sword

285
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,927
Such devotion deserves true respect

286
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,700
He was the first to sacrifice himself

287
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,770
for your mission

288
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,665
Sky was proud

289
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,571
He saw himself as an unrivalled fighter

290
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:24,475
What convinced him you could succeed

291
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,115
where he had failed?

292
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,277
You have trained, perhaps for 10 years

293
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,715
with one goal, my assassination

294
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,518
You have a great skill
that few can counter

295
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,538
Killing Sky got you within 20 paces of me

296
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,505
So why seek out
Broken Sword and Flying Snow?

297
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,945
I surmise that your skill

298
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,082
requires you to come within 10 paces

299
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,146
You needed a second sacrifice

300
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,015
to claim another reward

301
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:06,747
to bring you within 10 paces

302
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,156
Although Broken Sword and Flying Snow

303
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,228
had never met Sky

304
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:14,489
they instantly understood

305
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:17,132
the reason for his defeat

306
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,438
How far am I from the bookshelves?

307
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:35,142
About 10 paces

308
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,417
10 paces is fine

309
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,764
I need one of you to help me

310
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,601
Please decide between yourselves

311
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,470
Meet me at the Qin camp tomorrow morning

312
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,577
How swift thy sword!

313
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,321
True

314
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,222
Sky was a superior warrior

315
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,293
He willingly gave his life to this man

316
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,358
He can kill the King

317
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,060
We must proceed

318
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,905
That means we will die

319
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,243
Then we die together

320
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,224
You were one step ahead of me

321
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,109
Did I hurt you too much?

322
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,846
I should be the one who fights him

323
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,853
I want you to live

324
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,922
If you died, how could I live?

325
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:07,920
You will live on, promise me

326
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,404
Say it!

327
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,477
All right

328
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,261
Moon is on her way

329
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,763
I had better go

330
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:30,262
I am Nameless,
Prefect of Leng Meng County

331
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,067
Please allow me to fight this assassin

332
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:36,240
She is on His Majesty's most wanted list

333
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,280
Now she's here, I will arrest her

334
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,574
The assassin and I have an agreement

335
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,477
to fight one on one

336
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:44,720
Should I be unable to defeat her

337
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,220
please apprehend her

338
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,089
Your permission is sought

339
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,238
Draw your sword!

340
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,673
Hail! Hail! Hail!

341
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:18,745
Make your move!

342
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:23,519
Hail! Hail! Hail!

343
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,149
I die willingly

344
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:28,652
Make your move

345
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:35,954
Hail! Hail! Hail!

346
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,595
Hail! Hail! Hail!

347
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,100
Hail! Hail! Hail!

348
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:57,677
Hail! Hail! Hail!

349
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,823
How swift thy sword!

350
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:03,039
What are you here for?

351
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,210
For what you once said.

352
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:10,648
"I will fight the one
who harms Flying Snow"

353
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,715
Please draw your sword

354
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,993
Thank you

355
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,569
I believe you and
Broken Sword also fought

356
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:35,643
but rather it was

357
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:41,144
A fight to honor Flying Snow.

358
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:53,427
My master wishes you to have his sword

359
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,572
Why?

360
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,506
He and she are bound in life and death

361
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:07,409
They will never part,
nor will their swords

362
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,356
It is his dying wish

363
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,195
that you take his sword for your mission

364
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,501
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword

365
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,137
sacrificed themselves

366
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,771
so you can be within 10 paces of me

367
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,498
All three gave you their lives

368
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,770
The best of friends could not give more

369
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,713
Therefore you are

370
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:14,349
the most dangerous assassin of all

371
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,197
How did you uncover my plan?

372
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,464
The flames of these candles

373
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,832
are disturbed by your murderous intent

374
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,270
All of you

375
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,779
are willing to die for a cause

376
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:50,013
I'm ashamed to say
I am not that committed

377
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,210
Your Majesty has seen through our plan

378
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,723
If I had realised this sooner

379
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,560
I wouldn't have allowed you so close

380
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:05,130
A citizen of Qin would not do this

381
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:06,461
Who are you?

382
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,296
A man of Zhao

383
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:12,169
Your Qin soldiers killed my family

384
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:13,740
I wandered into Qin

385
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,400
and was adopted

386
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:17,272
I discovered my real identity
10 years ago

387
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,580
and set my heart on this plan

388
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,877
You've come to avenge Zhao

389
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:26,481
I see

390
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:28,985
I would like to know

391
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,560
if your special skill has a name

392
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:33,192
As Your Majesty guessed

393
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,029
there is only one crucial move

394
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:36,265
What is that?

395
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,266
"Death within 10 Paces. "

396
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:41,626
"Death within 10 Paces. " A good name!

397
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:43,463
All my guards are 100 paces away

398
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,937
outside the palace

399
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,269
You are within 10 paces

400
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:50,334
It would seem

401
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,438
that today I am doomed

402
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,785
But I sense your hesitation

403
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:06,852
Your Majesty is perceptive

404
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:08,664
However

405
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,063
you too have underestimated someone.

406
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:13,963
Who?

407
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,569
Broken Sword

408
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:24,479
I needed to prove to them

409
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,013
that my sword was fast and accurate

410
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,424
Within 10 paces

411
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,699
my sword strikes with surgical precision

412
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,331
If it enters at precise pressure points

413
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,528
it will not cause any fatal injury

414
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:25,936
If one of you would take a blow

415
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:29,702
before witnesses, we can fool the King

416
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,778
Such a blow is hardly child's play

417
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,851
How is Sky now?

418
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:38,514
Fully recovered

419
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:41,120
His trust in your sword
was extraordinary

420
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,654
The King's security is impenetrable

421
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:45,588
There was no other way

422
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:48,428
His Imperial Guards were useless

423
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,367
He should have died three years ago.

424
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:53,602
What went wrong?

425
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,937
I abandoned the plan

426
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,709
The King must not be killed

427
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:06,614
He said that?

428
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:07,373
Yes

429
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,572
Why?

430
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,183
I also asked him

431
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:11,543
What did he say?

432
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,779
He would not explain that day

433
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,789
Broken Sword is the strongest
of the three

434
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:22,255
He and I are probably equal in skills

435
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:27,627
What he told me later

436
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:30,372
greatly unsettled me

437
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:32,901
While I'm alive

438
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,001
I'll stop you assassinating the King

439
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,310
I will help you

440
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:44,217
He let the opportunity go by

441
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,555
This time, we must succeed

442
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,121
See you tomorrow at the Qin camp

443
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,329
Please do me a favor

444
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,269
Help me fight Broken Sword!

445
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:13,845
Master!

446
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:21,521
What are you waiting for?

447
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:25,586
Although I had agreed to help her

448
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,688
attack from behind is dishonorable

449
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:30,523
so I couldn't draw my sword

450
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,229
But we both knew

451
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:35,128
if we did not stop Broken Sword

452
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:37,732
we would never succeed

453
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:30,474
Moon, don't!

454
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:34,749
You're no match for him. Stop

455
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:00,746
I knew this would happen

456
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,480
You can't stop me now

457
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:07,551
Even wounded, I will still stop you

458
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:10,958
Then I will kill you!

459
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:20,162
Did I hurt him too much?

460
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,428
Your special medicine

461
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,429
should heal his wounds in a day

462
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:27,600
Have you delivered it?

463
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,678
I tended to the wound myself

464
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:34,177
After the battle, take my sword

465
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:35,850
and follow Nameless to see the King

466
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:37,218
Yes

467
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:39,716
They won't treat a servant harshly

468
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,490
If the assassination succeeds

469
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:44,859
wave a red flag on your return

470
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,860
If it fails, a yellow one

471
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:50,327
If something happens to you

472
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,056
any message will be useless

473
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,931
I will smile from Heaven

474
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:59,240
if I see a red flag

475
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:05,063
How is Flying Snow?

476
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:06,665
She is resting

477
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:12,812
She doesn't know I've come

478
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:15,813
You said you'd stop me

479
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:17,851
Please abandon the mission

480
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,549
You know I am a man of Zhao

481
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:20,889
So am I

482
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,790
Doesn't Qin want to conquer Zhao?

483
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:24,192
Yes

484
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:26,257
Isn't the King the enemy of Zhao?

485
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:27,593
Yes

486
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:29,728
Who are you trying to defend?

487
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,429
You call yourself a man of Zhao?

488
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:39,639
Flying Snow has asked me that too

489
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,438
When we first met

490
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,172
I was living a carefree life

491
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,919
I fell in love with her after our first fight

492
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:59,085
She's the daughter of a Zhao general

493
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:01,826
who died in battle against Qin

494
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:03,858
She inherited his sword

495
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:06,596
I knew she would avenge her father

496
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:09,564
I promised to help her

497
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,975
Calligraphy and swordplay

498
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:16,568
share the same principles

499
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:19,140
We did calligraphy to
inspire our swordplay

500
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:20,415
and to heighten our powers

501
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:24,715
She knew I'd drifted since childhood

502
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:27,786
calling no place home

503
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,317
Once we'd killed the King, she said

504
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,551
she would take me to her home

505
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:35,592
There'd be no more swordsmen

506
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,189
only a man

507
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:38,456
and a woman

508
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,322
The essence of calligraphy
is from the soul

509
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,031
Swordsmanship is the same

510
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:13,928
Both aspire to truth and simplicity

511
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,563
Gradually I recognised a greater cause

512
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:25,646
Three years ago we perfected our skills

513
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:27,942
Flying Snow insisted on going ahead

514
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,909
Together, we stormed the palace

515
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:11,762
She asked why I had abandoned the mission

516
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,828
I told her the King must not be killed

517
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:18,204
That is what calligraphy taught me

518
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:20,903
I didn't kill the King

519
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,405
After that she refused to talk to me

520
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,182
Please abandon your plan

521
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:32,345
No

522
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,920
Was your sword forged in hatred?

523
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:36,282
Yes

524
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:38,620
For 10 years, it has never tired

525
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:42,355
I can't stop now

526
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,155
How can I dissuade you?

527
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:45,996
Only by killing me

528
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:47,826
Are you that determined?

529
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:49,537
Yes

530
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:52,633
Allow me to convey my conviction

531
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:55,606
in three words

532
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:40,786
These words express my mind

533
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:43,213
Please consider

534
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:55,536
Moon, give my sword to Master Nameless

535
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:57,798
Flying Snow and I will never part

536
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:59,438
nor will our swords

537
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:15,480
Master Nameless

538
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:17,721
although I am just a humble servant

539
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:20,122
allow me to say a few words

540
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:24,256
I've been with my master since
I was eight

541
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,427
He taught me martial arts

542
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,464
and how to be a decent person

543
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:30,868
Whatever my master does

544
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:32,562
is for a good reason

545
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:35,642
The words he has given you

546
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:38,141
carry a deep meaning

547
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:46,217
This will be the last thing
I can do for my master

548
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:51,489
Master Nameless, please take his advice

549
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:05,867
Why did you want to do that?

550
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:07,871
I wanted to follow the
example of my master

551
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:10,771
and to persuade you with my life

552
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,413
You're still young
Life is precious

553
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:16,310
If you must die
you should die for a greater cause

554
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:22,349
Be on your way

555
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:25,115
I will remember
what should be remembered

556
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:45,735
What were the words he wrote?

557
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:47,414
"All under Heaven. "

558
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:49,447
All under Heaven...

559
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:50,811
Broken Sword said

560
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:54,519
"The people
have suffered years of warfare

561
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:57,121
"Only the King of Qin can stop the chaos

562
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:59,427
"by uniting all under Heaven. "

563
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:03,862
He asked me to abandon the assassination

564
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,360
for the greater good of all

565
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:09,429
He said, one person's suffering
is nothing

566
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:12,936
compared to the suffering of many

567
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:15,737
The rivalry of Zhao and Qin is trivial

568
01:25:16,177 --> 01:25:19,669
compared to the greater cause

569
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:26,220
The person who really understands me

570
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:29,014
is my most feared enemy

571
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,290
Alone, I have endured so much criticism

572
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:40,195
So many attempts on my life

573
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:42,835
No one understands my intentions

574
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:45,404
Even my court officials

575
01:25:45,673 --> 01:25:49,109
see me as a tyrant

576
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:54,715
But I never imagined

577
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:57,010
that Broken Sword, my arch-enemy

578
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:59,720
would truly understand

579
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:04,091
and appreciate my real motives

580
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:17,527
I would like to know

581
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:21,304
how you mean to kill me
without your sword?

582
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:23,069
By capturing yours!

583
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:38,926
This sword has protected me

584
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:40,560
through all my battles

585
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:44,559
Having found a true confidant
in Broken Sword

586
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:47,599
if I die, I am content with my life

587
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:50,996
Let "All under Heaven"

588
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:54,532
guide your decision

589
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:01,399
It's just dawned on me!

590
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:03,295
This scroll of Broken Sword's

591
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:05,495
isn't about sword technique

592
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:08,107
but about swordsmanship's ultimate ideal

593
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:11,645
Swordsmanship's first achievement

594
01:29:11,879 --> 01:29:13,312
is the unity of man and sword

595
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:15,472
Once this unity is attained

596
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:17,913
even a blade of grass can be a weapon

597
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:19,816
The second achievement is when

598
01:29:19,987 --> 01:29:23,753
the sword exists in one's heart

599
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:26,450
when absent from one's hand
One can strike an enemy at 100 paces

600
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:28,685
even with bare hands

601
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:31,461
Swordsmanship's ultimate achievement

602
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:35,992
is the absence of the sword
in both hand and heart

603
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:37,497
The swordsman is at peace

604
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:38,899
with the rest of the world

605
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:42,167
He vows not to kill

606
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:44,640
and to bring peace to mankind

607
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:15,337
Your Majesty,
your visions have convinced me

608
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:19,844
that you are committed to the highest ideal

609
01:30:20,815 --> 01:30:22,282
of ultimate swordsmanship

610
01:30:24,185 --> 01:30:25,812
Therefore I cannot kill you

611
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:31,791
Remember those who gave their lives

612
01:30:33,027 --> 01:30:34,961
for the highest ideal: Peace.

613
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:14,915
No more killing
Nameless went within 10 paces of the King

614
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:18,317
He could not have missed

615
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:21,989
There is only one explanation

616
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:23,990
He must have abandoned the mission

617
01:33:25,633 --> 01:33:27,533
What did you say to him?

618
01:33:28,135 --> 01:33:29,534
I wrote three words

619
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:31,327
What words?

620
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:33,601
"All under Heaven. "

621
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:38,268
That is all you care about!

622
01:33:38,512 --> 01:33:39,376
And you

623
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:42,548
I don't believe you

624
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:44,079
How can I convince you?

625
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:53,760
Draw your sword

626
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:57,522
You've misled Nameless

627
01:33:58,065 --> 01:34:00,556
You've ruined Sky
and the Kingdom of Zhao

628
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:01,969
Draw!

629
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:07,737
When we first met...

630
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:11,143
I had to prove myself to convince you

631
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:15,813
What can I do this time?

632
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,842
Just draw your sword!

633
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:46,463
Why didn't you fend off my sword?

634
01:35:47,942 --> 01:35:49,409
So that you'd believe me

635
01:35:57,585 --> 01:35:59,610
I always wanted to go home with you

636
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:06,693
Sadly, it won't happen now

637
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:13,389
Take good care of yourself

638
01:36:27,548 --> 01:36:29,106
Why didn't you defend yourself?

639
01:36:38,259 --> 01:36:39,692
Why didn't you defend yourself?

640
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:52,404
Why didn't you?

641
01:38:04,578 --> 01:38:06,876
No more drifting, no more roaming

642
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:15,422
I'm taking you home now

643
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:19,524
Our home

644
01:39:34,835 --> 01:39:36,393
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

645
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:39,663
Permission to execute?

646
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:42,107
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

647
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:45,570
Permission to execute?

648
01:40:05,432 --> 01:40:08,424
He conspired to assassinate Your Majesty

649
01:40:08,635 --> 01:40:09,966
Show no mercy!

650
01:40:10,137 --> 01:40:13,698
This is the law of Qin!

651
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:18,440
To conquer all under Heaven

652
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:20,704
the law must be enforced

653
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:23,508
Set an example for the world!

654
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:28,079
Execute him! Execute him!

655
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,687
Execute him!

656
01:40:32,993 --> 01:40:35,393
Execute him! Execute him!

657
01:40:35,562 --> 01:40:37,052
Execute him!

658
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:47,674
Execute him!

659
01:42:09,156 --> 01:42:13,058
Hail! Hail! Hail!

660
01:42:16,497 --> 01:42:27,874
Hail! Hail! Hail!
