1			
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:35,312			 
AUTUMN			
			
2			
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:46,678			
It began with the chair.			
			
3			
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,944			
I have been waiting for			
This long.			
			
4			
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:17,585			
I know.			

5
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:20,931
Loser.

6
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,771
Heaven, Banana, dance
Damned snout, would you like?

7
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:38,376
This is the game room
Most magnificent I have ever seen.

8
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:11,531
Well, well as you
Feel after the crime.

9
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:12,921
Do Regresas for another test?

10
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,248
I think that the first was not very effective,

11
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:19,640
Symbol appeared positive for
Percent, so I am not convinced.

12
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:26,016
Third test today, Mom
Bear, you are pregnant, there is no question about that.

13
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:28,979
It is very easy to know, does your
Nipples are Carmelites?

14
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:33,384
Yes, perhaps your boyfriend spread
His sperm throughout your body.

15
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:38,759
Silence, man. Watch just take 2
Litres of juice and I have to urinate soon.

16
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:41,383
You know where is the laboratory.

17
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:45,167
I pay for it when finish.

18
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:48,805
Do not think that is yours alone
Because what marques with your urine.

19
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:21,422
You should not be surprised
With that, already know.

20
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:23,593
I do not know, it is not time yet.

21
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:26,107
I bring one of these.

22
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,857
Therein lies.

23
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:36,655
A small symbol of positive
Pink, is so uncomfortable.

24
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:42,450
I do not know why you do, this is
One thing that can not be undone.

25
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:06,697
Hello, hello, hello.

26
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:08,294
I almost committed suicide.

27
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:09,590
Is Juno?

28
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:12,424
No, it's Morgan Freeman, is there
Some collector bones?

29
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:15,736
I have one in my belly, what happens?

30
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:18,332
I am pregnant.

31
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:20,346
What? Are you sure?

32
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:22,361
Yes is Bleeker.

33
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:25,985
Probably you
Feel weak, do almorzaste well?

34
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,736
This is not a problem of hunger, I did
3 pregnancy test and I am more than sure.

35
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,645
How did produjiste urinates
3 to test? It is amazing.

36
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:41,502
I do not know, I took like 10 tons
Juice, anyway

37
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:46,064
I am telling you that I am pregnant
And you are acting as if you do not import it.

38
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:48,546
Is it really true?

39
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:50,626
Unfortunately yes.

40
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:54,250
Oh, my God.

41
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,295
Oh shit, that stinks.

42
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,313
That was the emotion that
Expected at first.

43
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:06,501
Will you go to the hospital or not? Why not
I think you want to make your parents know.

44
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:11,437
I will not go to Women Now
Just going to do that.

45
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:14,142
Would you like to call on you? What
Becky did it for the past year.

46
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:18,343
No, I call myself, but I want
Help me out of something that is very important.

47
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:22,344
You know, if I had known
You would have helped.

48
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,031
Seriously.

49
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:28,641
Were it so boring
Wanted to have a child?

50
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:33,238
He asked me, I mean
Sex, not to get pregnant.

51
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:38,682
When I decided that
Ibas to stay with Bleeker?

52
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:40,762
I do not know.

53
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,088
A year ago in the Spanish class.

54
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:48,371
You love it.

55
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:54,306
It is not, it is very
Complicated, does agree?

56
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:58,605
And I do not feel good talking about that.

57
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:00,901
So how was it?

58
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:03,073
How does it feel?

59
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,401
Is Magnificent?

60
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,537
Hello, Bleek.

61
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:47,911
Lindo tiger.

62
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:49,754
You should be proud.

63
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,535
Sudé much to do.

64
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:57,286
Why your shorts
Are so yellow today?

65
00:09:57,926 --> 00:09:59,425
My mom said that the colour speaks volumes.

66
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:01,114
Say hello to Carol.

67
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:03,441
I will tell.

68
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:11,208
When I see men running well,
Things with their swinging by the short,

69
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,768
I always imagine things but not
Want, all I saw were swords.

70
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:18,629
It should be running.

71
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,956
So guess what.

72
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:23,519
What? I do not know.

73
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:26,582
I am pregnant.

74
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:39,379
What should we do?

75
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:48,157
Oh, you know, I think that just as in botaré
Trash, before they make worse.

76
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,268
In class we talked
How is she is pregnant,

77
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:54,501
And tends to make an infant.

78
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:56,128
Typical, yes, yes.

79
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:59,893
That's what happens when
Our mothers leave pregnant.

80
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,924
So, are you okay with this?

81
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:08,595
Yes, yes of course,
I mean, you know,

82
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,516
I think you should do what
You create better, you know?

83
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,297
Oh, I am sorry to have had sex with you,

84
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,143
It was not your idea.

85
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,438
What do you say? Who was?

86
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:26,375
I went where I wanted, did agree?

87
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,594
What did we do then?

88
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:00,023
The book is breaking.

89
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:01,867
Why?

90
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,508
Just look at their pages.

91
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:09,430
The funny thing is that Steve
I wish secret.

92
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:12,023
As always desired
Girls strangers.

93
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:16,817
Girls who wear glasses,
Trousers and a grotesque makeup.

94
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,505
Best if it touches the zeal and read scores and
It is behind a desk when I grow up.

95
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:26,522
Oh, yes, he loves all that shit.

96
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,083
He does not want to admit it because he wants
Be a perfect cheerleader,

97
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:33,915
As Leah, who incidentally
Is attracted by teachers.

98
00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:36,431
I, too, I love Woody Allen.

99
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:42,258
Okay people.

100
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,022
We will practice today chromatography,
So you feel fortunate if grab a 4.

101
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:54,694
Well, there's nothing like an experiment.

102
00:12:56,836 --> 00:13:00,632
I made the questions last night,
So that you can copy.

103
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:01,896
Not copiaré your work.

104
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:03,867
You do every week.

105
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,367
True, I do not
Feel indebted, can agree?

106
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:08,649
No, no, definitely
I want to bring something to the table.

107
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:09,865
A strange way.

108
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,397
Who is ready for a wonderful thing?

109
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:17,820
It hurts me to the brain so it's not
I look bright lights today.

110
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:21,741
I have tried to explicártelo
By 9 pm, never hear.

111
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:25,883
No, Josh, because no receipt
Orders, neither you nor anyone.

112
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,209
Not if indeed the shots
Of a type known as Kato.

113
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:31,303
As I told you, nothing happened.

114
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:33,242
I will prepare things,

115
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:36,007
Juno, would you like to put some in the box?

116
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:37,428
It is a pleasure.

117
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:38,459
I go to the infirmary.

118
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:39,770
Well, how do you do?

119
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:43,256
Well, call me when you learn
To love, as did your brother,

120
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:47,287
Should have their biceps to
You can endure when the urines.

121
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,007
Sure, Amanda, I will make sure
To do so, and you know what I will do.

122
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:57,472
In fact to do so, flavored
Are the best to do so.

123
00:13:59,053 --> 00:13:59,662
Did you?

124
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:10,239
Pregnant? WOMEN NOW

125
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,583

You can wait a moment,
I am a little busy.

129
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:39,316
Okay, tell me.

130
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:41,883
Yes, it is already decided.

131
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,347
Yes, yes, I need an abortion.

132
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:48,848
16.

133
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,896
Let's say you have spent 2
Months and 4 days after I did.

134
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:57,627
More or less, it's just an estimate.

135
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,331
Sorry, what I am doing everything?

136
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:05,814
Oh, say the hatred cundo
"Sexually active".

137
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:07,629
What does it mean?

138
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:11,143
To me, or is activated someday
A kind of permanent status.

139
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:15,143
I believe that when you do the
Real life is not what you think of ways.

140
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:23,096
You should have seen, when I
Took off his hat and seemed quite the opposite.

141
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,768
My dad was in the Army, but
Now is a specialist at H-Vac.

142
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:29,660
He and my mother divorced
When I was 5 y. ..

143
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:33,595
... Lives in a reservation in Arizona with
Her husband and 3 children new replacement.

144
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:37,191
Strangely she commanded by cactus
Mail every day Valentine

145
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:42,329
I think they are things that she believes,
As cacti that last longer than oneself.

146
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:47,252
That is my stepmother Bren, it is
Completely obsessed with the dogs.

147
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:51,328
Have a beauty salon
And always smells like acetone.

148
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:54,408
So how was
Your delivery last night?

149
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,815
Which of them, sir, I was moving
A game room of a house to another.

150
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:03,051
After that I went to
Eat sushi in a place.

151
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:06,250
Juno, how did you do something on my urn?

152
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:12,454
Mac, you know? I ordered the box.

153
00:16:13,393 --> 00:16:14,561
There was a blue shit.

154
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:17,219
I mean, shit,
In it this morning.

155
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:21,765
Never would you anything to your box, Brenda.

156
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:25,048
I mean, maybe I have encountered.

157
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:31,216
Mary Beth, if you cast over it in the
Potatoes, I will hit your tiny ass.

158
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:38,579
All babies want to get on board.
All babies want to get on board.

159
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,265
All babies want
Board. All ...

160
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,155
Hello Su-Chin.

161
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,060
Hello, Juno.

162
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:48,640
How are you?

163
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,225
You know, quite well.

164
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:55,250
So what did the
Task for the class?

165
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:57,018
No, not yet.

166
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,297
I want to do that at this point,
If not, I can not concentrate.

167
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,375
I can help you if you want.

168
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:05,784
No thanks, not necessary.

169
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:09,377
That is a wise decision, know
This girl who became crazy ...

170
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:17,360
... And took many beers at once, and will only be removed
Clothes and threw in bed with another, and it was like ...

171
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,736
Demons, I am a big disease.

172
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:24,640
That you were you.

173
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,329
It was good to see, Su-Chin.

174
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:33,920
Your baby does not have to
Be hurt, you know?

175
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:36,080
They can feel the pain,

176
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:38,672
And have nails.

177
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:42,969
Do Nails? Really?

178
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:02,640
Welcome to Women Now,
Friendly place for needy

179
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:05,685
Please put your hands where
Could see them and put them into the box.

180
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:08,515
Hey, I am here for the big show.

181
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:10,639
Your name, please.

182
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:12,919
Juno McGuff.

183
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:17,311
She believes it is a false name,
Jean Stewards or Mother Teresa.

184
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:25,983
I need to fill this for both sides. We need
All the details of every time he did.

185
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,343
Want some condoms?

186
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,014
They are free.

187
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,169
No, I am out of sex.

188
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:38,623
My boyfriend said that those you love.

189
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:41,157
He says that smell like a cake.

190
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,687
All babies want to get on board.
All babies want to get on board.

191
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,000
God will appreciate this miracle.

192
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:26,312
Hey, what are you doing here?

193
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:27,921
It was assumed that you seek to 4.

194
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,141
Not what I could do.

195
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:31,734
Olía very bad there,

196
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:34,657
And had horrible magazines
To save money.

197
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:39,797
And the strange receptionist was trying to
Give me some condoms that looked like grape gum.

198
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,673
And he would tell me about the flavor cake
Having the balls of your boyfriend.

199
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,751
Oh, great.

200
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:49,296
And Su-Chin was there, and I said:
Oh, hello, babies have claws.

201
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:50,501
Nails.

202
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:51,751
That's grotesque.

203
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:54,421
Do you think that babies can
Squeeze your bag to leave?

204
00:19:56,014 --> 00:19:57,358
I still fraught, Leah.

205
00:19:57,982 --> 00:20:03,124
Girl, you have to lower our voices, my mother is
Indoors and do not know that we are sexually active.

206
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:04,592
What does that mean?

207
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,296
I have been thinking,
I have this baby ...

208
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,154
... And feed it to a
Women in need,

209
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,950
Some women infertile,
A lesbian couple.

210
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:19,529
But then you play too fat and your
Breasts grow and you have to say.

211
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:23,761
Maybe not want to be so selfish.

212
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:29,874
Or maybe everything can be going to shit and get very
Wrong and you can not graduate or not enjoy your holiday.

213
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:31,826
I was going to say to
Bleeker of toas forms.

214
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:36,637
You see ads for adoption,

215
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:38,433
See them all the time magazines.

216
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:41,107
Do advertisements for parents?

217
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:47,357
Yes, desperate because they respond,
Say their preferences and their customs,

218
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:50,059
Is absolutely legitimate.

219
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:58,059
Magnificent, partner united spiritually
Found true love.

220
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:01,042
Do not miss this.

221
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:02,951
I do not want these.

222
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,012
Juno, it would be good to hear me.

223
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:10,276
No, I hear you, it's just that I do not want to give the baby
A family which describes itself as magnificent.

224
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:12,793
-- Why?
-- It's just that I think is a great exaggeration.

225
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:17,653
-- Okay, what you have in mind exactly?
-- I was thinking of graphic designers,

226
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:22,670
They have 30 years, you know, an Asian girlfriend,
Impressive dresses, plays guitar base,

227
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:24,747
But I do not want to be
Too.

228
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:28,088
Okay, what about this?

229
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:32,418
Young educated and looking for a successful
And a baby to a family of 5.

230
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:36,901
It will be rewarded if we aid
To complete the circle of love.

231
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,650
That sounds great.

232
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:43,713
Sounds like a call, and they have
3 children must be 3 small devils.

233
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:45,884
Oh, what about this?

234
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:51,479
Those are Mark and Vanessa Loring,

235
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,791
And are a beautiful couple.

236
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,025
Hello boy, are you ready to eat?

237
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:08,572
No, I do not think so.

238
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:10,821
Corriste 8 miles today.

239
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,416
I have no famine yet.

240
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:15,759
But there is soup, your favorite dish.

241
00:22:16,993 --> 00:22:17,836
Yes.

242
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,120
Did you know that McGuff called
Today while you run?

243
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:24,149
You know that I think of it.

244
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:27,260
Yes, yes, you have mentioned
A couple of times.

245
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:29,853
She is just ...

246
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:31,790
... Different.

247
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:34,071
Yes.

248
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:02,808
I am not quite sure of this, but ...

249
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:04,510
How deletearías what?

250
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,871
No school has been more of a contact
That led you to be exposed.

251
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,432
Well, it was only
Wondering as a possibility.

252
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:14,384
I am asking you money,
Do for a legal consultation?

253
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:16,729
I am not asking for anything.

254
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:21,402
Except, perhaps pity, try
To be fresh and not beating me.

255
00:23:21,824 --> 00:23:23,791
What did you do, golpeaste someone?

256
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:24,935
Not.

257
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,024
I think it is better than
Finish what to say.

258
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,617
I am pregnant.

259
00:23:37,257 --> 00:23:38,008
Oh, God.

260
00:23:38,822 --> 00:23:42,118
The handing in adoption, and
Find the perfect match ...

261
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:44,664
... And are going to pay for
Medical expenses and everything y. ..

262
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:49,914
... Within 38 weeks we can
Pretend that this never happened.

263
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:53,273
Are you pregnant?

264
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:54,648
Sorry.

265
00:23:55,178 --> 00:23:58,601
Sorry, and what it is
Consolation, was drunk y. ..

266
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:00,615
... I did not know what he was doing y. ..

267
00:24:01,351 --> 00:24:04,280
... I have not taken a
Drink since Wednesday ...

268
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,389
... In the morning.

269
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,125
I did not even know that
Were sexually active.

270
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:10,499
Who's the Man?

271
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:14,951
I do not know the exact name,
I mean, you have nails.

272
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:16,855
Nails, did indeed?

273
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:17,934
Yes.

274
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,139
I mean, who is the father, Juno?

275
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:25,529
It Paulie Bleeker.

276
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:27,717
Does Paulie Bleeker?

277
00:24:29,654 --> 00:24:30,294
What?

278
00:24:31,356 --> 00:24:32,574
I do not think that is the most appropriate.

279
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,952
That's right, no?

280
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,716
There is what laugh.

281
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:38,091
No, it's not.

282
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:40,792
Paulie is indeed brilliant in ...

283
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:42,104
Okay.

284
00:24:42,435 --> 00:24:43,295
... Whole.

285
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:45,793
Have you thought about adoption?

286
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:49,748
Yes, yes, and there are a couple
Who have been unable ...

287
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:55,152
... You know, have tried for 5 years.
-- Are in a magazine that those bored.

288
00:24:56,089 --> 00:25:00,137
And they have a lawyer who is really
Meet with me next weekend.

289
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:05,997
Juno is something very difficult to do, is
Probably harder to understand what you can now.

290
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:08,574
I know ...

291
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,638
... And it is just that I am not
Ready to be a mother.

292
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,294
Of course you are not.

293
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:17,151
Even you agreed
The medicine for asthma.

294
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:20,824
That was once, and she
Did not die if you remember.

295
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:25,744
Honey, have you considered,
You know, the alternative?

296
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:27,572
Not.

297
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:29,918
Well, you are a small Viking.

298
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:33,010
First things first.

299
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:34,869
Okay, we
To keep healthy

300
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,056
Need prenatal vitamins ...

301
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:40,275
... Incidentally do incredible things
For us, so that is something positive.

302
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:44,183
We need to schedule an appointment with the
Doctor, to tell us when you are going to give birth.

303
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,385
I will go to
Know this couple.

304
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:51,824
You are just a little girl, I do not want to leave
Alone with a couple of desperate.

305
00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:53,728
Thanks, Dad.

306
00:25:54,822 --> 00:25:56,946
When are you going to be the girl on the
That we must not say when?

307
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:05,587
I do not know really what kind of girl I am.

308
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:21,758
I have to accept that
This is all my fault.

309
00:26:22,588 --> 00:26:24,540
I think that was
Bored and wanted to do it.

310
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:27,961
I would like to think that Juno
Was naive with that, Mac.

311
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:29,464
I am not ready to become a grandfather.

312
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:31,009
You will not be a grandfather.

313
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:36,632
Somebody's going to find a tremendous blessing
Jesus to take charge of this situation.

314
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,243
Do you think he did without
Be mad?

315
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,117
Yes, but expected to be
Rope in spite of the drugs.

316
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:47,149
Yes, that's what I thought, which took
Something, anything less this.

317
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:51,882
I am going to beat this guy in the
Eggs the next time you see it.

318
00:26:52,335 --> 00:26:55,179
Mac, we, you know that idea was not him.

319
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:06,197
Hello, I am Vanessa, you should be
Juno and Mr. McGuff. Hello.

320
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:08,027
Vanessa Loring.

321
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:09,480
Vanessa you, right?

322
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:13,399
Thanks for welcome me and
Irresponsible my daughter in her house.

323
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:14,918
Oh no, thank you.

324
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:16,184
Thanks.

325
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:17,589
Forward.

326
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:20,216
Do I want to give their coats or your shirt?

327
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:21,668
Oh, yes, sure, thanks.

328
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:27,856
I read in a magazine that said they were superelegantes,
As these people have artificial wood at home,

329
00:28:28,104 --> 00:28:30,089
Honestly, who
Believe that deceiving these people?

330
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:32,011
Do we have found in a magazine?

331
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:34,260
Hello, Mark Loring, I am her husband.

332
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:36,743
-- How are you? I'ma Mac McGuff.
-- Pleased to meet you.

333
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:38,620
Hello.

334
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:40,744
She is Gerta Rauss, our lawyer.

335
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:43,009
Gerta Rauss.

336
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:45,198
Hello, pleased to meet you.

337
00:28:46,947 --> 00:28:48,416
And, of course, she is Juno.

338
00:28:49,743 --> 00:28:50,933
As the city in Alaska.

339
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:51,980
Not.

340
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:53,354
No?

341
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,635
Okay.

342
00:28:55,182 --> 00:28:56,571
Honey, do you have
The honour to sit?

343
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:58,071
I thought in search of something to drink.

344
00:28:58,384 --> 00:29:02,479
What they would like? A coca or
Vitaminized water or orange juice.

345
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:03,946
I want a beer, please.

346
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:07,820
She has ...

347
00:29:08,554 --> 00:29:11,977
... A wonderful sense of
Humor, a thing inherited from me.

348
00:29:13,242 --> 00:29:14,070
I sit.

349
00:29:16,384 --> 00:29:19,602
Then, Juno, the first thing,
How advanced are you?

350
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:20,898
I am in the Pre.

351
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,946
No, I mean in your pregnancy.

352
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:30,741
In fact, my stepmother took me yesterday
And the doctor said that she was 12 weeks.

353
00:29:31,368 --> 00:29:32,134
That's great.

354
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,242
You are in your second trimester.

355
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:38,116
Yes, apparently.

356
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:40,212
I am doing my fourth month.

357
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:41,211
Great.

358
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:43,760
My friend told me that
The first 2 months are tough.

359
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:45,584
I have not noticed at all.

360
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:52,163
I am more concerned about when you have to put
These elastic pants, instead of jeans.

361
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,633
I think that being pregnant is beautiful.

362
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:56,927
You do not know how fortunate you are.

363
00:30:00,553 --> 00:30:03,208
Let's talk about
How will we do this thing.

364
00:30:03,711 --> 00:30:05,741
What talk? What
When you have the thing?

365
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:07,928
The arroparé and are shipped.

366
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:12,022
Mark and Vanessa are ready
To make an open adoption.

367
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:13,507
What does that mean?

368
00:30:13,976 --> 00:30:20,054
That means they will be sending recent photo
The baby so that they can know how your child grows.

369
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,445
No, no, no, I do not want any photos
Nor any notification.

370
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:32,395
I mean, let us do it as old school, and
Know, I leave the baby in a basket, and then I leave.

371
00:30:33,426 --> 00:30:35,209
I think that patearía
The Old Testament.

372
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:38,224
Exactly, is not it?

373
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,411
You know what I mean?

374
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:41,803
As in the old days,
When it was quick and dirty.

375
00:30:43,646 --> 00:30:48,803
Well, we agree, a traditional
Abortion is what will be involved.

376
00:30:49,443 --> 00:30:52,161
Shit, yeah, just close the deal.

377
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:55,363
Obviously, you will be compensated
With all the medical expenses.

378
00:30:56,366 --> 00:30:58,520
Looking for some
Other compensation?

379
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:01,536
Do we apologize?

380
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,083
Not.

381
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:08,738
No, I do not want to sell it, just ...

382
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:10,753
... I ...

383
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:16,707
... I just want the baby
Be with people who love,

384
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,456
And become good parents, do you know?

385
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:22,957
I mean, I am in the Pre.

386
00:31:24,472 --> 00:31:26,518
It is too early.

387
00:31:28,441 --> 00:31:31,832
You are doing a beautiful and
Kind event for us.

388
00:31:32,331 --> 00:31:34,518
Vanessa wanted the baby
Since we were married.

389
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:36,082
I would be much Mom.

390
00:31:37,535 --> 00:31:38,456
I know what we mean.

391
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:41,128
Never has meaning
Born to do something?

392
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:42,767
Yes.

393
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:44,191
Heating and Air Conditioning.

394
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,737
There you have it.

395
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:47,909
I was born to be a parent.

396
00:31:48,518 --> 00:31:49,455
That is what I believe.

397
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:54,050
What about you, Mark? Feeling
Well with the idea of being a parent?

398
00:31:55,252 --> 00:31:56,096
Yes.

399
00:31:57,439 --> 00:32:00,956
Every man wants to be a father, wants
Train your football team, y. ..

400
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:04,938
... Attend the Science Fair
And see how its done volcano.

401
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,191
Yes, all that.

402
00:32:08,597 --> 00:32:12,502
Perhaps Gerta wants to give documents
Preliminary to sign.

403
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:19,142
Will could use the bathroom first because
Pregnancy makes me urinate much?

404
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:25,313
The bath is broken down but if you upload, doubles
To the right and then left you go a. ..

405
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:27,001
Oh, yes, a room with bath.

Is she okay?

407
00:33:17,201 --> 00:33:17,983
Sorry.

408
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:19,481
Sorry, did not expect to see.

411
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:24,904
Not.

412
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:27,576
Do you have any kind of paranoia?

413
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:32,685
I caught a little perfume on your wife.

414
00:33:33,217 --> 00:33:33,890
Really?

415
00:33:34,528 --> 00:33:35,828
Yes, smells like happiness.

416
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:38,046
Smell, so you see what it feels like.

417
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:41,045
Does that make me happy?

418
00:33:41,841 --> 00:33:42,903
Of course.

419
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:48,700
I am giving the best gift of his life, without asking
Anything in return, just have to be there when ...

420
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:50,078
Everything is covered with ...

00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:51,355
Placenta.

422
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:52,686
Yes that.

423
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,216
Is that an LS Paul?

424
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:00,670
Yes it is.

425
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,888
Vanessa gave me a
Room for my stuff.

426
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:08,107
Have you had a room in
The whole house for your stuff?

427
00:34:09,638 --> 00:34:11,152
Well, you are very fortunate, Mark.

428
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:13,699
Oh, it was beautiful.

429
00:34:14,464 --> 00:34:16,935

No sounds better than a Fender.

This arm is very expensive, you should
Being an investment.

Do you want to come?

00:38:55,702 --> 00:38:56,733
Oh, do you really?

506
00:38:58,267 --> 00:38:59,048

Oh, you can not miss this,

Therein lies your baby.

514
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,154
Oh, my God.

515
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,563
Therein lies its power.

516
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:39,232
And the arm.

517
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,047
And there are the feet.

Well, there is.

00:40:10,248 --> 00:40:11,125
Do they want to know the sex?

526
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,342
-- Yes.
-- No.

527
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:14,311
-- Please.
-- No, not sex.

528
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:16,966
You will be surprised when des birth.

529
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,639
Well, I want to be surprised Mark and Vanessa
And if you tell me not know hide.

530
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,951
Did Mark and Vanessa are
College buddies?

531
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:25,433
No, no, they are the adoptive parents.

532
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:28,120
Oh, well, thank God for that.

533
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:30,638
What does that mean?

534
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:34,261
It's just that I have seen many
Teenage mothers y. ..

535
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:37,512
... Obviously are not the best
Environment to raise a baby.

536
00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:39,544
How can you say that?

537
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:43,138
What if these parents
Adoptive are evil?

538
00:40:43,388 --> 00:40:45,356
As parents evil.

539
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:51,091
They can be negligent, it is perhaps safer
She raise it better, has seen that?

540
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:53,464
No, I suppose not.

541
00:40:54,903 --> 00:40:56,183
What exactly is your job?

542
00:40:57,214 --> 00:41:00,059
I am an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

543
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:04,010
Well, I am a nail technician and I think
We both must restrict what we know.

544
00:41:04,558 --> 00:41:05,323
Excuse me.

545
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,543
He believes that is so special because it draws pictures
Babies there, my daughter 5 years what can be done,

546
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,807
Let me tell you that is
The brain of a nené.

547
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:16,121
So why not return to ninth grade
And tries to make a career of truth.

548
00:41:22,136 --> 00:41:23,558
Bren speaking well.

549
00:41:25,104 --> 00:41:26,010
The adore.

550
00:42:29,664 --> 00:42:31,288
Juno, not expecting to see you here.

551
00:42:31,806 --> 00:42:34,602
I have something very special that
Teach, how Vanessa is here?

552
00:42:36,057 --> 00:42:38,182
There, she will work until evening.

553
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:41,040
She is taking advantage throughout the
Free time you have before ...

554
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:43,164
Oh, yes, wait stinks.

555
00:42:44,681 --> 00:42:46,631
Do you want to move, I was taking a drink?

556
00:42:47,116 --> 00:42:48,211
Want one?

557
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,587
What is going on the rich
With their urban habits?

558
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:54,678
I have nothing better
What to do with these 44.

559
00:42:56,289 --> 00:42:57,492
There are so badly at the end.

560
00:42:57,898 --> 00:42:59,616
What you work?

561
00:43:00,538 --> 00:43:02,227
Working at home, I am a composer.

562
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:04,882
I jodas.

563
00:43:05,553 --> 00:43:06,819
As Johan Brams O. ..

564
00:43:07,178 --> 00:43:08,991
No, things commercial.

565
00:43:09,743 --> 00:43:10,570
How?

566
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:12,054
Commercial.

567
00:43:13,428 --> 00:43:15,647
Yes, Ali wears the commercial
Children Paramount?

568
00:43:27,164 --> 00:43:28,147
Yes, I paid for that.

569
00:43:30,927 --> 00:43:31,929
Good sales.

570
00:43:33,897 --> 00:43:35,397
I wonder what would your group.

571
00:43:36,944 --> 00:43:38,255
You said you had something to show me.

572
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:41,726
Cálmese, good man, his future child.

573
00:43:43,725 --> 00:43:44,647
Hey, check it out.

574
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:50,272
I think it looks like my friend Paulie.

575
00:43:52,287 --> 00:43:53,692
She also is like you.

576
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:55,082
More polite.

577
00:43:58,537 --> 00:43:59,552
Know if a boy or girl.

578
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:04,490
I can not, the doctor can,
Meant to be a surprise.

579
00:44:05,927 --> 00:44:08,020
That is something we would like to know.

580
00:44:08,723 --> 00:44:14,723
When you take tons of alcohol, you are not aware
You can get pregnant, not an imbecile.

581
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:16,317
Imbecile, huh?

582
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,441
Yes, you know.

583
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:19,755
I know what it is.

584
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:20,724
All right?

585
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:22,036
Definitely we
Chocolate, please.

586
00:44:22,989 --> 00:44:24,192
Do not worry about that.

587
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:28,195
I have a rest, I
Make eating healthy

588
00:44:28,896 --> 00:44:31,081
I can not stop
In front of my computer.

589
00:44:31,895 --> 00:44:33,878
Anyway, I hope you are ready.

590
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:37,332
Do You Hear that?

591
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:39,222
What?

592
00:44:39,472 --> 00:44:42,658
This is my favorite song. It'sa
Song made for a few superstars.

593
00:44:43,036 --> 00:44:43,973
The Carpenters.

594
00:44:44,286 --> 00:44:45,753
Oh, yes, yes, I know the Carpenters.

595
00:44:46,581 --> 00:44:49,471
A woman drummer, a format
Like The White Stripes.

596
00:44:49,877 --> 00:44:52,144
Yes, the Carpenters are so fascinating.

597
00:45:01,286 --> 00:45:03,741
Yes, yes I enjoy.

598
00:45:04,928 --> 00:45:06,130
What you said that it was your group?

599
00:45:06,493 --> 00:45:11,709
Not what you said, is a mixture of
Stungeons, Pathy Smith and the Runaway.

600
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:14,520
Definitely this is serious,
Is enough for my son.

601
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:21,208
The magician of the grotesque?

602
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,567
That is the magician Lewis is the best magician.

603
00:45:25,161 --> 00:45:29,505
Please Derryl
Argento is the best magician.

604
00:45:30,848 --> 00:45:31,817
Is Argento?

605
00:45:32,301 --> 00:45:35,472
He is okay, but Lewis
Is completely insane.

606
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:42,505
You have spoken of buckets full of blood, you
Corners are red brains out of the picture.

607
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,692
Frankly it looks
Stupidly old.

608
00:45:47,816 --> 00:45:48,597
Give me the tape.

609
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:05,646
This is better than I thought.

610
00:46:06,205 --> 00:46:06,926
What you said?

611
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,800
Cursed you got a taste
Decent in this type of film.

612
00:46:11,774 --> 00:46:13,064
Very interesting.

613
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:18,370
Do you already have a name for the baby?

614
00:46:20,353 --> 00:46:23,558
Yes, something like that, you Vanessa
Like if Madison girl.

615
00:46:27,275 --> 00:46:28,946
Does Madison? Wait, endures.

616
00:46:30,899 --> 00:46:33,994
There is a little gay.

617
00:46:36,914 --> 00:46:39,885
What pretentious dare you
Say that with a name like Juno.

618
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,776
Look, my father had tremendous obsession
With Rome and Greek mythology

619
00:46:47,198 --> 00:46:50,181
Then decided to appoint well
As one of the wives of Caesar,

620
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:55,259
Is a bit strange, but I am quite sure
That was his only wife Juno because ...

621
00:46:56,711 --> 00:47:00,463
... It is assumed that it was very
Beautiful, as Diana Ross.

622
00:47:02,228 --> 00:47:03,244
That is interesting.

623
00:47:05,152 --> 00:47:06,196
Thank you?

624
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:10,853
There is something else.

625
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,103
Therein lies Vanessa, the better you go.

626
00:47:20,383 --> 00:47:22,544
She fights me when I see
Films that "do not contribute."

627
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:27,663
I handling this, I am very
Sound convincing to people.

628
00:47:27,913 --> 00:47:28,648
No, Juno, no.

629
00:47:31,506 --> 00:47:32,806
Juno, what happens?

630
00:47:33,258 --> 00:47:34,508
-- Nothing.
-- What are you doing here? What's going on?

631
00:47:34,776 --> 00:47:35,976
Nothing, I went to the doctor today.

632
00:47:36,242 --> 00:47:37,163
Is there something wrong with the baby?

633
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:40,334
The baby is great, this is the hand
Right until you can see phalanges.

634
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,232
Watch it here.

635
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:44,569
It is the baby.

636
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:46,292
It's your baby.

637
00:47:50,575 --> 00:47:52,915
Do not think that is sleeping?

638
00:47:54,252 --> 00:47:57,275
Hey, I am crazy about seeing my mom.

639
00:47:58,228 --> 00:47:59,504
Which is nice.

640
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,712
Juno was very gracious in
Bring to that we saw.

641
00:48:02,938 --> 00:48:04,764
Yes, I came as soon as I could.

642
00:48:05,256 --> 00:48:08,300
The ultrasound technician
Said something stupid y. ..

643
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:13,140
Technically my stepmother ...
Abuse of her by saying that.

644
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,275
What kind of suite have done.

645
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,288
Madness mother.

646
00:48:22,411 --> 00:48:24,007
There are just some things
I bought for the baby.

647
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,224
It is not supposed to you the
Gifting in a Baby Shower.

648
00:48:27,896 --> 00:48:31,317
My stepmother when I was pregnant with my
Hermanastra, received one million gifts.

649
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,256
But he was not jealous
Because it is super to me.

650
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,255
I do not think we do one.

651
00:48:37,004 --> 00:48:38,460
Why they would not?

652
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:42,302
I do not think people know how I
Feel about this situation because ...

653
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:45,175
... Do not understand.

654
00:48:45,711 --> 00:48:46,583
What is the point?

655
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:51,473
No, no, no, do not believe
That I will leave.

656
00:48:52,036 --> 00:48:52,972
No, I do not think so.

657
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,974
We went through a situation
And above.

658
00:48:56,724 --> 00:48:57,662
This did not work.

659
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,989
Yes, Call it fear.

660
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,583
They should not be suspicious.

661
00:49:07,316 --> 00:49:09,787
I do not like children
Ipods were free.

662
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:12,739
Those who put on those
Pulóveres weapon,

663
00:49:13,816 --> 00:49:14,972
They shot in 40 minutes.

664
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:20,317
Your parents should be
Worried without knowing where you are.

665
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:22,363
No, I mean, I am pregnant.

666
00:49:22,832 --> 00:49:24,924
What else could I put?

667
00:49:26,473 --> 00:49:27,879
It should probably be back.

668
00:49:28,378 --> 00:49:29,378
Hey, do not forget your bag.

669
00:49:29,957 --> 00:49:30,816
Oh, thanks.

670
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,316
Okay, beware.

671
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,177
Where the hell were Juno?

672
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:07,006
I was at the home of Mark and Vanessa, I went to teach
Ultrasound and I stayed for a couple of hours.

673
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:10,177
A couple of hours to Do
What were you in the first place?

674
00:50:11,192 --> 00:50:15,552
They wanted to know about everything and told them
To keep abreast and it did.

675
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,547
Are you a kind of messenger?

676
00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:19,498
Viajaste one hour to the east.

677
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:24,703
Only I did, you know, while
Mark and I were ...

678
00:50:25,295 --> 00:50:28,295
Vanessa waiting ...
Look to the Wizard of the grotesque,

679
00:50:29,888 --> 00:50:32,592
He put me some discs
Of his music, so ...

680
00:50:33,592 --> 00:50:34,530
... Was good, very good.

681
00:50:37,029 --> 00:50:40,343
Juno, you can not do that well.

682
00:50:41,436 --> 00:50:45,153
No, that was not the case, they were
Agree completely with that.

683
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:46,453
I do not understand.

684
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:48,733
Mark is a married man, there are limits.

685
00:50:49,857 --> 00:50:50,829
Oh, come on.

686
00:50:51,138 --> 00:50:52,000
Listen.

687
00:50:52,312 --> 00:50:53,325
Brenda.

688
00:50:54,312 --> 00:51:00,656
You are acting as if you are pregnant,
As if you were the one he was going to deliver her baby.

689
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:05,310
What does it matter who is married?
I have friends who are married.

690
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:09,342
It does not work well, girl. No.
Know the dynamics of marriage.

691
00:51:09,686 --> 00:51:10,794
You do not know anything about me.

692
00:51:11,107 --> 00:51:11,951
I know enough.

693
00:51:14,923 --> 00:51:15,827
We do not even have a dog.

694
00:51:16,386 --> 00:51:18,935
Yes, we do not have a dog because
You are allergic to their saliva.

695
00:51:20,216 --> 00:51:23,761
I have sacrificed for you Juno
And in a few years when you move,

696
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:25,810
Going to get one of these.

697
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:27,481
Ojala is big.

698
00:51:27,778 --> 00:51:29,136
Oh, go fly high.

699
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:54,713
Hello, Juno.

700
00:51:55,778 --> 00:51:56,559
What can I do for you?

701
00:51:58,464 --> 00:51:59,417
Is Bleeker?

702
00:52:00,057 --> 00:52:02,135
The mother Bleeker
Possibly was attractive,

703
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:03,856
But the nature ended.

704
00:52:06,495 --> 00:52:07,824
You know, one of those fat.

705
00:52:15,904 --> 00:52:16,743
Hello, man.

706
00:52:17,465 --> 00:52:19,402
You are so concentrated
That seems not to hear anything.

707
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:21,558
Hello, what happens?

708
00:52:21,824 --> 00:52:28,511
Just came to greet,
Surprised to see at night.

709
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:33,152
The Tic Tacs orange is
The only flaw of Bleeker.

710
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:37,573
The day that I was pregnant, he smelled
You are a small but delicious.

711
00:52:47,728 --> 00:52:48,964
It seems that you are
Becoming a ...

712
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:50,776
... Pregnant these days.

713
00:52:54,056 --> 00:52:56,430
We told you about the adoption ...

714
00:52:57,026 --> 00:53:01,775
... And there are a couple who are
Desperate and I met so it is ...

715
00:53:03,401 --> 00:53:03,991
... Yes.

716
00:53:04,196 --> 00:53:05,368
How are they?

717
00:53:05,726 --> 00:53:08,336
Well, the guy is great.

718
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:10,367
His name is Mark y. ..

719
00:53:11,196 --> 00:53:13,697
... Likes film
Grotesque and plays guitar ...

720
00:53:14,431 --> 00:53:15,775
... Actually went to see this afternoon.

721
00:53:16,617 --> 00:53:17,616
Is that normal?

722
00:53:18,507 --> 00:53:19,712
Probably not, but ...

723
00:53:20,695 --> 00:53:24,680
Listen, I spoke to Dad and Bren
And say they do not due.

724
00:53:25,711 --> 00:53:26,635
You rightly so,

725
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,819
I think it should be great.

726
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,711
That is a relief.

727
00:53:37,072 --> 00:53:38,524
These types seem about ...

728
00:53:39,073 --> 00:53:40,210
... Bobos.

729
00:53:41,944 --> 00:53:44,462
You think I am beautiful now.

730
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,288
Whenever you see infancy.

731
00:53:48,209 --> 00:53:49,228
I think you are beautiful.

732
00:53:50,006 --> 00:53:50,896
Heavens, Bleek.

733
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,102
Really.

734
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,805
The boys and I were thinking
Gather in the band again.

735
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:02,163
Yes, that could be.

736
00:54:03,272 --> 00:54:04,209
It would be great.

737
00:54:04,678 --> 00:54:07,196
I mean, once
Enters into this is not going to be able to ...

738
00:54:07,507 --> 00:54:08,632
... Touching.

739
00:54:10,178 --> 00:54:12,381
We can go back to being together as well.

740
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:14,239
It is an option.

741
00:54:18,864 --> 00:54:20,492
Are We were together?

742
00:54:21,193 --> 00:54:22,241
Yes, we were, you know?

743
00:54:24,412 --> 00:54:25,569
Over time.

744
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:33,379
Why not you like Devoy Katrina?

745
00:54:34,174 --> 00:54:36,019
They love it.

746
00:54:36,394 --> 00:54:38,299
I do not like, smells like soup.

747
00:54:39,018 --> 00:54:39,924
Did not you have smelled?

748
00:54:40,471 --> 00:54:41,642
And the whole house smells like soup.

749
00:54:51,227 --> 00:54:52,055
Okay.

750
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:56,806
   So we have ivory and cheese cake.

751
00:54:57,977 --> 00:54:58,914
It is yellow.

752
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,289
I wanted to paint a color
Neutral until we have the baby.

753
00:55:07,194 --> 00:55:10,337
Why do you think that
Yellow is a color neutral?

754
00:55:10,695 --> 00:55:11,756
I know of no one
With a fourth yellow.

755
00:55:14,727 --> 00:55:16,993
I was thinking of
Ivory for this side.

756
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:21,101
I do not know, maybe I should put
A large poster for this part.

757
00:55:25,446 --> 00:55:26,677
Why not wait a few months?

758
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:31,146
I do not believe that the baby wants
Have a wall full of clouds.

759
00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:42,441
What are you waiting if you say that this
Is a process for women.

760
00:55:43,413 --> 00:55:45,068
Especially if it adopts,
Called anxiety.

761
00:55:46,381 --> 00:55:47,383
Anxiety.

762
00:55:49,286 --> 00:55:51,351
More than you
Had all these days.

763
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:58,850
Should we read a book, there
Chapters devoted to this.

764
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:00,505
I think it is too early to paint.

765
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,052
This is my opinion.

766
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:04,410
I disagree.

767
00:56:08,692 --> 00:56:10,036
This wall can mean something.

768
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:15,552
A photo there in the middle.

769
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:17,708
What do you think?

770
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:22,318
See?

771
00:56:26,521 --> 00:56:28,864
Come on, you do not put
And for a doughnut.

772
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,333
I am hungry, please.

773
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:31,583
You do not have.

774
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,551
Suéltame.

775
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,770
I am going to stun.

776
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:38,739
Oh, my God.

777
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:41,987
That's it, that's Vanessa Loring.

778
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,705
Does the magazine?

779
00:56:48,582 --> 00:56:50,268
She is very pretty.

780
00:56:50,584 --> 00:56:52,395
It looks like a model or something.

781
00:56:54,254 --> 00:56:56,662
It appears that you love children.

782
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:58,252
Yes, seriously.

783
00:57:07,988 --> 00:57:09,004
I do not get.

784
00:57:19,283 --> 00:57:23,863
I imagine a large biscuit,
With strawberry jelly or something.

785
00:57:24,878 --> 00:57:27,408
Oh, God, you are sick,
Just think in eating.

786
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:30,956
You have no substance.

787
00:57:32,253 --> 00:57:33,143
Juno.

788
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,239
Hello.

789
00:57:34,627 --> 00:57:36,688
What are you doing here?

790
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:39,331
I was shopping with my friends.

791
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:41,283
Are you gay?

792
00:57:41,596 --> 00:57:42,267
Not.

793
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,848
-- Please ignórala.
-- Agreed.

794
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:45,515
How do you feel?

795
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,627
Great, everything is wonderful.

796
00:57:47,971 --> 00:57:50,860
This seems a button.

797
00:57:53,361 --> 00:57:54,221
It's incredible.

798
00:57:56,408 --> 00:57:57,408
Oh, God.

799
00:57:57,704 --> 00:57:58,548
What?

800
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:00,172
Patadas, come and go.

801
00:58:03,298 --> 00:58:05,235
What would you feel?

802
00:58:06,328 --> 00:58:07,453
Are you kidding?

803
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:13,015
It's great, everyone wants tocarme
All the time, it's crazy.

804
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,752
You know, I am allergic, I
Could sneeze.

805
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:21,437
Would whatever.

806
00:58:24,827 --> 00:58:25,860
There is moving to me.

807
00:58:28,437 --> 00:58:33,438
You should try to talk, because it supposedly
You can hear, as if it were at sea.

808
00:58:49,095 --> 00:58:50,015
Hello baby.

809
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,406
It's me, it is Vanessa ...

810
00:59:02,481 --> 00:59:04,311
I can not wait to meet you.

811
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,624
Do I hear you, baby?

812
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,310
Sweet Angel.

813
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:29,810
Oh, God.

814
00:59:31,216 --> 00:59:32,359
It is magical.

815
00:59:37,856 --> 00:59:38,856
Thanks.

816
00:59:39,341 --> 00:59:40,356
Thanks.

817
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:49,779
SPRING

818
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,617
Hello.

819
01:00:34,117 --> 01:00:34,912
Hello.

820
01:00:35,163 --> 01:00:38,930
I saw this rare CD that you gave me.

821
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,320
Yes, why did you do it?

822
01:00:40,882 --> 01:00:42,070
Because it's funny.

823
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:43,744
Is it funny?

824
01:00:44,037 --> 01:00:50,244
Where does the power of rock,
Everything looks beautiful and embarrassing.

825
01:00:51,274 --> 01:00:53,976
Maybe you want an entire
Collection so that you can prove.

826
01:00:54,727 --> 01:00:55,585
Well ...

827
01:00:56,148 --> 01:00:57,678
... Considering your musical education ...

828
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:00,071
I can not wait to see how I teach.

829
01:01:00,929 --> 01:01:02,710
You will not win, returns to work.

830
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,759
Just called to say hello.

831
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:08,132
Well, thanks for calling.

832
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:14,224
Or that seems to eat Mexican,
And Chinese food, apparently.

833
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:16,445
How many more things pick?

834
01:01:16,835 --> 01:01:17,881
You are putting enormous.

835
01:01:18,412 --> 01:01:21,505
I need to eat, you should see me naked.

836
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,038
I do not think you have desires.

837
01:01:24,616 --> 01:01:29,867
Believe me, you do not want to, in fact use a
Gaza rare that I have any tight.

838
01:01:31,741 --> 01:01:33,412
I do not know, resemble a whale.

839
01:01:33,928 --> 01:01:34,755
Heat.

840
01:01:37,866 --> 01:01:39,304
Why the whole world looks at me?

841
01:01:40,053 --> 01:01:41,662
Probably want to fight.

842
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,551
He gave a kiss to
Geometry teacher.

843
01:01:46,819 --> 01:01:50,083
I had no choice, kissing me
Work a lot lately.

844
01:01:50,427 --> 01:01:52,681
Do not do with Mr. Keith.

845
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,240
Because it is not well
Do that these days.

846
01:01:55,927 --> 01:01:56,974
Keith is burning.

847
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:01,709
That is all purity.

848
01:02:03,396 --> 01:02:05,989
Is that Bleek has Escuchaste
Katrina Devoy something?

849
01:02:08,366 --> 01:02:09,224
Is Katrina?

850
01:02:09,865 --> 01:02:11,879
No way,
He does not like Katrina.

851
01:02:12,176 --> 01:02:13,582
He says he is a pig or something.

852
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:18,271
We listened to ask her, and will go to Benny
Hana, and then take and then go to his cabin.

853
01:02:19,692 --> 01:02:21,848
He told me that she smelled of soup.

854
01:02:22,178 --> 01:02:23,613
I can not believe that you have believed him.

855
01:02:23,944 --> 01:02:27,473
I went to his house for the last 4 years
His birthday, and I know that smelled strange.

856
01:02:28,504 --> 01:02:30,894
But you know what they do
Boys when they want a powder.

857
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,424
Oh, please.

858
01:02:33,723 --> 01:02:35,753
There is no way to have sex.

859
01:02:36,066 --> 01:02:37,408
Even I have seen
Cogiéndose hands.

860
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:39,315
It would not be so sure, did you.

861
01:02:39,896 --> 01:02:41,520
Yes, it was because I wanted to, you know?

862
01:02:42,223 --> 01:02:43,254
We were friends.

863
01:02:43,662 --> 01:02:44,878
Are you jealous?

864
01:02:45,396 --> 01:02:48,348
I thought you had said no
You mattered what he did.

865
01:02:48,657 --> 01:02:49,675
I am not jealous, is a joke.

866
01:02:49,864 --> 01:02:54,145
It's just that I know he does not like to Bleek Katrina, not
Like emotions such, it is quite good.

867
01:02:54,846 --> 01:02:56,864
I am now convinced.

868
01:02:57,284 --> 01:02:58,894
You know, actually I do not care.

869
01:02:59,096 --> 01:03:01,190
As can do
He is going to eat my hand.

870
01:03:11,441 --> 01:03:13,849
Are you going to honestly
Devoy provide you with Katrina?

871
01:03:15,549 --> 01:03:16,471
Hello.

872
01:03:16,704 --> 01:03:18,844
Leah said that ibas to go with it.

873
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,221
Yes, I asked him if he wanted to go.

874
01:03:22,205 --> 01:03:27,074
I was going to say that Benny Hana, the palmar
And then go to my parents' cottage on the beach.

875
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:32,231
Let's go in a limo.

876
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:35,136
Your mother must be very happy
I am not that you chose me.

877
01:03:37,353 --> 01:03:38,259
You are brave, why?

878
01:03:39,712 --> 01:03:41,462
I am not brave.

879
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:44,557
I am brilliant, it just
Fact that I can not leave,

880
01:03:45,103 --> 01:03:52,322
Also that everyone look at me all day on my
Bag and also that your noviecita told me that reeks.

881
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:56,245
Katrina is not my girlfriend, I doubt
She accepts, it's just that ...

882
01:03:57,507 --> 01:03:58,681
... The shape of his face,
It is only because his face.

883
01:04:02,336 --> 01:04:07,400
Yes, just go to have a good time, I think there are
Many good things to do that night.

884
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:14,837
I will promise to my feet that perhaps walk up
The church, perhaps hit by a garbage truck,

885
01:04:15,305 --> 01:04:18,869
Because everything would be more
Good to go too.

886
01:04:22,352 --> 01:04:23,555
You are being immature.

887
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:27,148
You have no reason to be
Angry with me, I mean,

888
01:04:28,618 --> 01:04:35,118
Broke my heart, I should be the one who is,
Should be very angry, it should not ever talk.

889
01:04:36,867 --> 01:04:40,616
Why was boring and I
Sex with you, and I did not want to get married?

890
01:04:41,023 --> 01:04:44,103
As you did it, you
The most poor, can agree?

891
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:45,616
And I know that you were not boring that day.

892
01:04:45,898 --> 01:04:50,381
Because there were so many things on TV And
Draft of the Witches Blair was about to begin.

893
01:04:50,648 --> 01:04:56,380
What you saw from the beginning, you could
Have seen but only wanted to do it and now.

894
01:04:59,696 --> 01:05:03,632
I know that sometimes I am not very decent,
That sometimes I am a real bitch.

895
01:05:06,505 --> 01:05:07,601
I still have your underwear.

896
01:05:08,036 --> 01:05:09,442
This is your virginity.

897
01:05:10,287 --> 01:05:11,256
Would you can silence?

898
01:05:11,725 --> 01:05:13,208
Avergüenzas Would you have done?

899
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:15,135
-- No.
-- Because at least

900
01:05:15,383 --> 01:05:17,445
Not have to bear the
Evidence under your sweater.

901
01:05:19,975 --> 01:05:20,975
I'ma planet.

902
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:26,647
Wait, let me help you.

903
01:05:27,896 --> 01:05:29,068
There are only 10 other pounds.

904
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,001
Hello.

905
01:06:17,467 --> 01:06:18,751
It seems that weighs.

906
01:06:19,122 --> 01:06:20,091
Is Vanessa is?

907
01:06:20,484 --> 01:06:22,155
No, it has not arrived yet.

908
01:06:24,388 --> 01:06:25,906
Why are you here? I have something for you.

909
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:31,833
Watch this.

910
01:06:35,926 --> 01:06:38,303
Is this is the room
Baby? It is beautiful.

911
01:06:39,505 --> 01:06:40,396
Oh, you are funny.

912
01:06:40,801 --> 01:06:42,770
This is where I save all my comics.

913
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:44,428
Let me show you one.

914
01:06:46,488 --> 01:06:47,740
One of those types.

915
01:06:48,832 --> 01:06:50,098
Take a look.

916
01:06:51,628 --> 01:06:53,269
Yuki, the most fertile.

917
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:56,145
Is it a superheroína pregnant?

918
01:06:56,754 --> 01:06:57,661
Is not it great?

919
01:06:57,957 --> 01:06:59,878
The found when he was
Organizing and reminded me of you.

920
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:01,879
Devils, yes.

921
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:05,960
This actually makes me
Feel much better.

922
01:07:08,037 --> 01:07:11,398
Yuki is a sore back, you must be
Proud to have the same status.

923
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:13,683
Thanks.

924
01:07:14,918 --> 01:07:16,073
What do you think of Toonish?

925
01:07:17,526 --> 01:07:19,182
Okay, do not look, no matter what.

926
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:28,602
This is a little slower, but it sounds
Well, totally crazy, and hardcore.

927
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:35,150
I heard this song.

928
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:38,323
-- Really?
-- Yes, this song is older than me.

929
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:40,587
I single out there.

930
01:07:42,008 --> 01:07:43,383
Who bailabas?

931
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,914
Sandy Aborgo,
Dance company great.

932
01:07:48,163 --> 01:07:49,321
-- Burning.
-- Much.

933
01:07:50,929 --> 01:07:53,148
I can imagine how bailabas.

934
01:07:53,789 --> 01:07:55,352
As a total imbecile.

935
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,960
In fact, your hands go here,

936
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:03,915
Mine here.

937
01:08:04,758 --> 01:08:06,289
That is what we did in'88.

938
01:08:06,664 --> 01:08:07,679
In this way.

939
01:08:08,054 --> 01:08:08,994
Yes, well.

940
01:08:09,194 --> 01:08:10,552
Are you sure that no
Fuiste dancer before?

941
01:08:10,806 --> 01:08:12,118
The dance is for morons.

942
01:08:13,694 --> 01:08:14,445
How you?

943
01:08:15,475 --> 01:08:16,444
I do not know.

944
01:08:18,821 --> 01:08:20,179
Did not feel something between us?

945
01:08:38,131 --> 01:08:39,102
I am separating Vanessa.

946
01:08:42,773 --> 01:08:43,444
What?

947
01:08:43,866 --> 01:08:48,195
I have a place in the city, everything is planned,
It is something I want to do long ago.

948
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:49,158
Not.

949
01:08:49,924 --> 01:08:50,519
No?

950
01:08:50,972 --> 01:08:52,504
No, definitely can not be there.

951
01:08:52,784 --> 01:08:53,909
When I released it ...

952
01:08:54,736 --> 01:08:55,611
... Not ...

953
01:08:56,344 --> 01:08:57,301
What is the problem?

954
01:08:58,691 --> 01:09:01,642
I mean, you
Going to deal with this, you know?

955
01:09:03,298 --> 01:09:05,815
I thought I would agree with that.

956
01:09:06,128 --> 01:09:12,250
I thought it would be perfect, I did not want to grow in the
Shit with separated parents, as almost every family.

957
01:09:14,112 --> 01:09:18,016
Look, I will have the baby and
Vanessa will be very happy.

958
01:09:19,047 --> 01:09:19,625
You just ...

959
01:09:19,968 --> 01:09:22,985
The baby be remedied, however,
I think it is ready to be a father.

960
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:24,641
But you are old.

961
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:30,267
What do you think about me?

962
01:09:31,345 --> 01:09:32,610
Why are you here?

963
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,471
Yo ...

964
01:09:38,314 --> 01:09:41,640
... I just like to be a part
A rare piece of furniture in their lives.

965
01:09:43,002 --> 01:09:49,531
This, this is what is becoming my life, draw
Boxes of things, I am the floor, how that's what you like?

966
01:09:49,956 --> 01:09:51,112
-- This is my fault.
-- No.

967
01:09:51,361 --> 01:09:53,158
Is Vanessa has infuriated
To see me here or something like that?

968
01:09:53,751 --> 01:09:55,915
You do not have anything to do,
Vanessa and I no longer love us.

969
01:09:56,511 --> 01:09:58,280
You were in love when
You married her.

970
01:09:59,065 --> 01:10:04,286
And if you were in love you can do it again as my
Leah friend who has returned with the same type as 4 times.

971
01:10:05,288 --> 01:10:06,443
Not what you are trying enough.

972
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:07,755
You can not blame anyone for this.

973
01:10:07,943 --> 01:10:08,849
No, you know what, Mark.

974
01:10:09,395 --> 01:10:11,519
No divorcies your wife.

975
01:10:12,832 --> 01:10:16,099
Does Please, I can do the
Please stay with Vanessa?

976
01:10:18,535 --> 01:10:19,378
Sorry, I ...

977
01:10:20,084 --> 01:10:24,457
I am not so young, I am 16, old enough
To know that you are acting like a stupid.

978
01:10:25,566 --> 01:10:26,504
Oh, and you know what?

979
01:10:27,612 --> 01:10:30,942
I bought another CD that I
Hit and stinks, it's just noise.

980
01:10:36,947 --> 01:10:38,148
Juno, what happens?

981
01:10:39,756 --> 01:10:40,443
Nothing.

982
01:10:41,536 --> 01:10:42,271
Why cry?

983
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:46,128
Do not cry, is that I am allergic to dust.

984
01:10:47,896 --> 01:10:48,600
What is the problem?

985
01:10:49,349 --> 01:10:50,426
What is the problem?

986
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:55,271
It is a bit sensitive, does not
It? Esparte process.

987
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:00,608
What did you do?

988
01:11:03,142 --> 01:11:04,047
There did nothing.

989
01:11:06,187 --> 01:11:07,015
Only ...

990
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:12,609
... I have been thinking ...

991
01:11:13,656 --> 01:11:16,392
-- What?
-- Just when I thought we were doing the right thing.

992
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:19,281
What talk?

993
01:11:21,437 --> 01:11:22,390
Only I wonder if ...

994
01:11:23,436 --> 01:11:24,219
... I am ready.

995
01:11:25,844 --> 01:11:26,937
I list.

996
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:32,297
We are ready, we are, we have to all
Classes, the nurse said we had finished.

997
01:11:32,763 --> 01:11:38,014
Listen, I am not prepared and
She wondered whether I am.

998
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:44,233
Wait a minute.

999
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:47,890
You know what happens,
He has called fear.

1000
01:11:48,312 --> 01:11:49,437
It is a type.

1001
01:11:49,702 --> 01:11:53,014
Both thought the same thing, a woman
Becomes mother becomes pregnant when,

1002
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,607
Perhaps he becomes a
Father when he sees her baby.

1003
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,616
It's going to be there, going to be there.

1004
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:04,067
Everything happened so fast and we went to
Newspaper, I thought it would take a few months y. ..

1005
01:12:04,644 --> 01:12:06,834
Within 2 weeks she was in that couch.

1006
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:08,458
But she does not know that.

1007
01:12:08,756 --> 01:12:11,507
Since then it has been like a clock.

1008
01:12:15,452 --> 01:12:16,999
What do you say?

1009
01:12:20,047 --> 01:12:21,640
It seems that bad times will come.

1010
01:12:25,226 --> 01:12:27,256
What would be good
Time for you, Mark?

1011
01:12:29,444 --> 01:12:31,196
Unless there are things I want to do.

1012
01:12:32,304 --> 01:12:33,507
How? Being a rock star.

1013
01:12:35,085 --> 01:12:35,865
Do not laugh.

1014
01:12:37,758 --> 01:12:38,774
Just say that this is ...

1015
01:12:40,101 --> 01:12:41,428
... This is something that will never happen.

1016
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,288
That pullover is stupid.

1017
01:12:49,006 --> 01:12:49,880
It grows.

1018
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,132
If I have to wait for you to become
In Kurt Cobain, I will be ever mother.

1019
01:12:58,771 --> 01:12:59,990
Never said I would be a good father.

1020
01:15:56,445 --> 01:16:02,149
Call Gerta Rauss, and she said that we can
Represent the two, is called divorce evenly.

1021
01:16:03,727 --> 01:16:05,194
So from now on, it is possible ...

1022
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:07,867
... Which is easier,
Since there are no children.

1023
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,055
Thank you for making the call, I think.

1024
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,366
Have you found a place to stay?

1025
01:16:20,256 --> 01:16:21,178
Yes, in the middle.

1026
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:24,383
No, it's not a hotel, is a floor.

1027
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,584
Did not the type eras good?

1028
01:16:33,741 --> 01:16:34,944
I wanted both the baby.

1029
01:16:36,474 --> 01:16:37,583
I know.

1030
01:16:57,724 --> 01:16:59,535
-- It seems a ticket ...
-- Let me see.

1031
01:17:42,302 --> 01:17:46,690
I never realized how much I liked being in
Home, I have been very different for some time.

1032
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:56,861
Hello, Dad.

1033
01:17:57,189 --> 01:17:58,425
Hello, large piece of Jumbo.

1034
01:18:00,019 --> 01:18:00,862
Where were you?

1035
01:18:01,175 --> 01:18:04,379
Just watching the way
Fastest to reach here.

1036
01:18:07,862 --> 01:18:08,862
Where are you all?

1037
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:12,173
Bren was to carry Tod
His kind of skating.

1038
01:18:13,628 --> 01:18:16,096
When will learn that there can skate?

1039
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,409
You seem a little angry, sweetheart.

1040
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,222
What happens?

1041
01:18:22,878 --> 01:18:23,721
I do not know.

1042
01:18:29,986 --> 01:18:32,174
It is just that I am losing
My faith in humanity.

1043
01:18:33,348 --> 01:18:34,722
Can you tell me why?

1044
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,471
I just ...

1045
01:18:37,893 --> 01:18:38,752
... I wonder if ...

1046
01:18:40,485 --> 01:18:42,423
Two people can ...
Be together for good.

1047
01:18:44,018 --> 01:18:44,924
How couples?

1048
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,127
You know.

1049
01:18:46,579 --> 01:18:47,626
People in love.

1050
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:53,876
Got problems loves? Because I have to be
Honest, I do not approve that you are out on your condition.

1051
01:18:54,892 --> 01:18:56,205
That is a disaster.

1052
01:18:56,324 --> 01:18:57,168
No, Dad, it is not ...

1053
01:18:57,808 --> 01:18:58,701
This is very shocking.

1054
01:18:59,042 --> 01:19:00,356
You know what I mean, salidita.

1055
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:02,262
Please, stop.

1056
01:19:02,606 --> 01:19:03,418
Round the world.

1057
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,807
This is not that.

1058
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:16,463
I only need to know that it is possible that two people
That love can be happy together forever.

1059
01:19:18,073 --> 01:19:19,339
That is not easy, of course.

1060
01:19:20,651 --> 01:19:23,871
I am not the best example
Of the world, but ...

1061
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:26,948
... I have been your mother 10 years and I do not know ...

1062
01:19:28,056 --> 01:19:29,384
... We can say that we are very happy.

1063
01:19:31,776 --> 01:19:32,635
Watch ...

1064
01:19:33,932 --> 01:19:34,964
... In my opinion ...

1065
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,431
... The best thing you can do is to look
To the person who loves you for what you are.

1066
01:19:43,306 --> 01:19:46,168
Good things, bad things. Fea, beautiful.

1067
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:48,573
I bet, which you are.

1068
01:19:50,384 --> 01:19:52,696
The person named will always believe
That the sun goes behind your ass.

1069
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:58,024
That is the kind of
Person we all want.

1070
01:19:59,665 --> 01:20:00,261
Yes.

1071
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:06,352
Yes, I believe that I am that person.

1072
01:20:07,446 --> 01:20:08,820
Yes, of course, we can all be.

1073
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,962
Yes, there will always be someone who loves you and you
Support no matter how annoying you are.

1074
01:20:15,851 --> 01:20:16,839
Obviously.

1075
01:20:22,165 --> 01:20:23,055
Dad, I think I am going a. ..

1076
01:20:24,148 --> 01:20:25,588
Leave a moment, but ...

1077
01:20:26,275 --> 01:20:27,540
... I come back early.

1078
01:20:29,133 --> 01:20:29,976
Okay.

1079
01:20:30,304 --> 01:20:31,476
You are talking about me, this is not the case.

1080
01:20:32,759 --> 01:20:33,475
Oh, yes.

1081
01:20:57,375 --> 01:21:00,157
Bleeker, check your mail.

1082
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:33,059

Tic Tac boxes, in my mailbox?

Coupled with those tic tacs.

... I think I love you.

1096
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:11,831
Are you teasing me?

1097
01:22:12,689 --> 01:22:13,408
Not.

1098
01:22:14,486 --> 01:22:15,611
I mean, really.

1099
01:22:16,548 --> 01:22:19,925
You are the best person
I have known good ...

1100
01:22:20,592 --> 01:22:22,424

Have to try ...

The attempt lot, in fact.

1103
01:22:26,784 --> 01:22:28,187
You are intelligent in nature.

1104
01:22:29,329 --> 01:22:30,424
You are not like others.

1105
01:22:31,126 --> 01:22:33,578
Although you always see,
Every time I order ...

1106
01:22:33,862 --> 01:22:34,658
... You see y. ..

1107

That's how my late
Heart every time you see it.

1110
01:22:58,799 --> 01:22:59,626
Mine too.

1111
01:23:02,546 --> 01:23:04,252
Well, it's everything you can ask.

1112
01:23:07,797 --> 01:23:08,828
The golden boy.

1113
01:23:12,155 --> 01:23:13,735
Can we make love now?

1114
01:23:15,184 --> 01:23:16,390
Yes.

1115
01:23:28,732 --> 01:23:32,389
Hey, you know, going to give birth soon
Time if you continue doing that.

1116
01:23:56,539 --> 01:23:57,539
Dad.

1117
01:23:58,617 --> 01:23:59,430
What?

1118
01:24:00,304 --> 01:24:02,228
Dad, you run, I think
Broke the source o. ..

1119
01:24:04,008 --> 01:24:04,961
Or?

1120
01:24:06,008 --> 01:24:07,710
We must leave.

1121
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:08,819
We run away.

1122
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:10,431
Okay.

1123
01:24:11,042 --> 01:24:12,039
Did you have everything ready?

1124
01:24:12,383 --> 01:24:12,871
Yes.

1125
01:24:13,086 --> 01:24:14,148
That is not left anything.

1126
01:24:14,335 --> 01:24:16,367
Oh, please, please.

1127
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:22,072
There we go.

1128
01:24:24,415 --> 01:24:25,774
Hurry, it starts the car.

1129
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:27,617
Dad.

1130
01:24:32,006 --> 01:24:34,383
-- Wait, wait.
-- Get out of the medium.

1131
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,430
-- Do not do that.
-- What?

1132
01:24:39,818 --> 01:24:41,399
-- What are you doing.
-- But it is fun.

1133
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:45,865
I was pressing the spine.

1134
01:24:46,618 --> 01:24:51,023
It's called spinal what to do, you can not have it
Still, the doctor says that you are not extensive enough.

1135
01:24:51,491 --> 01:24:56,807
Oh, come on, I do not think it has anything
Worse, I can not think of anything more.

1136
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:58,694
Doctors say that.

1137
01:24:58,975 --> 01:25:01,180
Too late to make
God, let the people shout.

1138
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,195
Oh, shit.

1139
01:25:03,897 --> 01:25:07,272
Excuse me, may end up
To meet my daughter.

1140
01:25:10,645 --> 01:25:14,069
Bid, bid, bid.

1141
01:25:37,911 --> 01:25:39,800
And then ...

1142
01:25:39,721 --> 01:25:41,112
... I do not know where ...

1143
01:25:43,656 --> 01:25:44,144
... There was ...

1144
01:25:44,844 --> 01:25:46,096
... Why was it.

1145
01:25:52,127 --> 01:25:54,438
I said that we were not to tell
Bleek who was having the baby,

1146
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:59,201
She had great competition and not
I wanted to be worried about me.

1147
01:26:04,999 --> 01:26:06,077
But what he discovered anyway.

1148
01:26:24,044 --> 01:26:25,703
Someday back here, sweetheart.

1149
01:26:28,498 --> 01:26:29,531
When you tap.

1150
01:26:42,014 --> 01:26:43,092
Hello.

1151
01:26:43,856 --> 01:26:45,825
We apologize.

1152
01:27:27,641 --> 01:27:29,297
Bleeker decided that
I did not want to see the baby.

1153
01:27:31,202 --> 01:27:34,173
Me neither, it will not
I felt it was ours.

1154
01:27:41,716 --> 01:27:43,391
I think it was always there.

1155
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:49,591
You can see his son.

1156
01:27:51,874 --> 01:27:53,827
I have a son.

1157
01:27:56,498 --> 01:27:58,905
This is.

1158
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:22,796
How luzco?

1159
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,404
As a new mother.

1160
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:27,449
Asustada up bones.

1161
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:55,024
And then there was the chair.

1162
01:28:58,632 --> 01:29:05,695
Vanessa, if you stay
I maintain, Juno.

1163
01:29:23,347 --> 01:29:27,457
SUMMER

1164
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:57,296
As a boyfriend, Paulie Bleeker is lost,
It is my cheese macaroni.

1165
01:29:59,689 --> 01:30:02,344
I know that people tend to romanticize
Before playing, but ...

1166
01:30:03,547 --> 01:30:05,156
... I believe that in my usual style ...

1167
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:13,078
Hello.

1168
01:30:13,592 --> 01:30:14,795
Hello.

1169
01:30:19,609 --> 01:30:20,437
Ready?

1170
01:30:20,858 --> 01:30:22,077
Yes.
