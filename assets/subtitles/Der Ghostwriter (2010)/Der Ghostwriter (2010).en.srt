1
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,683
Come on!

2
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:23,836
But you realize
I know nothing about politics?

3
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,377
- You voted for him, didn't you?
- Adam Lang? Of course I did.

4
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:29,745
Everyone voted for him.
He wasn't a politician, he was a craze.

5
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,146
Well, there you go.

6
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:35,778
Look, it's a new ghostwriter he needs,
not another goddamn politico.

7
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,989
He was paid $10 million for these memoirs,

8
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:42,026
but rumor has it
the manuscript's a crock of shit.

9
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:45,258
Rhinehart's lending him his house
at the ocean so they can fix it,

10
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,058
and the pressure
must have gotten to McAra.

11
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,800
Pathologist said his blood was,
like, three parts booze.

12
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,929
You mean he drowned by accident?

13
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,574
Accident, suicide, who cares?
It was the book that killed him.

14
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:57,901
Well, that's encouraging.

15
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,840
Who is this McAra?
Should I have heard of him?

16
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:04,907
Yeah. He was some kind of aide to Lang
when he was Prime Minister,

17
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,850
so don't admit that you haven't.
He was with him for years.

18
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,586
I don't know, Rick.

19
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,157
This is a great opportunity for you.

20
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,299
Plus the money is good. Kids won't starve.

21
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:22,265
- I don't have any kids.
- I do.

22
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:37,941
Roy.

23
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,817
Who're you expecting to bomb you,
Random House?

24
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,288
We're publishing Lang's memoirs.

25
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,985
That's enough to make us a target,
apparently.

26
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:49,960
Thank you.

27
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,073
- How many have you seen?
- Five. You're the last.

28
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:11,911
I must be honest.

29
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,146
I don't think you're the right man
for this assignment.

30
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,983
Then it's a good job
it's not your decision, Roy.

31
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,685
John Maddox, chief executive
of Rhinehart, New York.

32
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,750
Sir.

33
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:26,553
Sidney Kroll,
Mr. Lang's Washington attorney.

34
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:27,622
Mr. Kroll.

35
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:30,692
And Nick Ricardelli I believe you know.

36
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:32,058
All right, Rick.

37
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,273
All right, I gather from Rick
you're aware of the situation?

38
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,112
Perhaps you can enlighten us

39
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,308
and tell us what exactly
you're gonna bring to this project.

40
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,646
Nothing.

41
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,283
No, I'm not gonna pretend
to be someone I'm not.

42
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:52,846
You have my CV.

43
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:56,223
His last effort was
the autobiography of a magician,

44
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,560
<i>I Came, I Sawed, I Conquered.</i>

45
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,360
Yeah, and it went straight
to number one, so...

46
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,595
After you turned it down, Roy.

47
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,233
Look, I don't read political memoirs.
Who does?

48
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,069
And I gather you've spent
$10 million on this book.

49
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:15,709
How much of that are you gonna see back?

50
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:17,908
Two? Three?

51
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:20,247
It's bad news for your shareholders.

52
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,312
And it's worse news
for your client, Mr. Kroll.

53
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,088
Adam Lang, he wants a place in history,
not in the remainder tables.

54
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,252
Oh, please!

55
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,524
It's because I know nothing about politics

56
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:35,293
that I'll ask the questions that get
right to the heart of who Adam Lang is.

57
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,834
And that is what sells autobiographies.

58
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:39,632
Heart.

59
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,975
Wow! That's nicely done.

60
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,670
- What utter balls.
- You think so?

61
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:50,442
John, of course.
Adam Lang's a world historical figure.

62
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,983
His autobiography is gonna be
a world-publishing event.

63
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,781
Yeah, well, I got warehouses filled with

64
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,516
world-publishing events
waiting to be pulped.

65
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,185
Sid?

66
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,862
Adam is obviously still very upset
by what happened to Mike McAra.

67
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:10,300
He was irreplaceable.
Irreplaceable, and yet he has to be replaced.

68
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,865
Adam can certainly appreciate the benefits
of trying someone different.

69
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:19,139
In the end, it's about chemistry.
Do you work out, maybe?

70
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:21,646
- Not really.
- That's a pity. Adam likes to work out.

71
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:25,206
Actually, I know a good writer
on the <i>Guardian</i> who uses a gym.

72
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:31,548
Okay, maybe we could just run over
the publishing schedule, yeah?

73
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,057
We need to wrap this up in a month.

74
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,353
- A month?
- Yes.

75
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,588
- You want the book in a month?
- We already have a first draft.

76
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:39,290
Yeah, well, it needs a lot of work.

77
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,233
That's why I like your résumé here.
You're fast, and you deliver.

78
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:47,100
You name it, he ghosts it.

79
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,704
And you're a Brit.

80
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,869
The ghost should be a Brit.

81
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:53,069
To get the jolly old tone right, right?

82
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:58,538
- Do you have any family commitments?
- No, I have no family. Why?

83
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,346
Adam is locked into a US lecture tour,

84
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,480
also a fundraising program
for the Adam Lang Foundation.

85
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,649
It's a month in the States. That's okay.

86
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:08,694
Couldn't I bring the manuscript back here
to work on?

87
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:13,129
I'm afraid not. It's in a secure environment
in Marty Rhinehart's own house.

88
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,560
Only a few people are allowed to handle it.

89
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,192
Sounds more like a bomb than a book.

90
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:23,471
I will need to see it myself at some point.
I am supposed to be editing it.

91
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,978
Yeah, in theory.
Actually, we need to talk about that.

92
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:30,846
- How soon can you get over there?
- As soon as you want.

93
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,043
- He'll fly tonight.
- Rick.

94
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,106
It's okay.

95
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,526
Okay, you're in.

96
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,918
Oh!

97
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,055
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thanks.

98
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:48,531
- Rick.
- Thank you.

99
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,262
Actually, I have something here

100
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:52,531
- you might want to look at.
- Is that... Is that...

101
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,403
No, no, no, this isn't Adam's book.
No, it's another client of mine.

102
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,908
Yeah, perhaps you can let me know
what you think.

103
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,370
Sure.

104
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,242
Okay, if you're gonna get
that evening flight,

105
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,749
we'd better talk contracts with Rick here.

106
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,615
Wanna show our friend to the door?
Would you?

107
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:08,879
Roy?

108
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,824
Call you in an hour, buddy.

109
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,980
Hey!

110
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:15,518
Remember...

111
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,153
Heart.

112
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,961
There's something not quite right
about this project.

113
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:28,129
- What? Me, you mean?
- Obviously you.

114
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,639
And McAra. Suicide?

115
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,745
He didn't strike me as the suicidal type.

116
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:36,643
Always nice to see you, Roy.

117
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,645
Good luck.

118
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,529
Oh, God.

119
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,373
Thank you.

120
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,918
- Yeah?
- <i>Congratulations!</i>

121
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,554
- On what?
<i>- On having me as your agent.</i>

122
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,721
Yeah, I can hardly believe my luck.

123
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:01,889
<i>Are you packed?</i>

124
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,400
I just got mugged.

125
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,333
<i>Shit! Are you okay?</i>

126
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:11,240
Yeah, all they took was the manuscript
that Sidney Kroll gave me.

127
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:12,933
<i>What? Why?</i>

128
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,008
I don't know. You tell me.

129
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,904
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

130
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:20,076
No, I'm fine. I think they must
have followed me from Rhinehart's.

131
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,950
<i>Why would they do that?</i>

132
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:26,023
Well, maybe they thought
I had Lang's book.

133
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,456
I knew this whole thing was a bad idea.

134
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,719
<i>You're still okay to fly tonight, right?</i>

135
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,889
For God's sake, Rick, I'm in shock.

136
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,298
<i>Well, here's another shock for you.</i>

137
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,267
<i>For one month's work</i>
<i>on a manuscript that's already written,</i>

138
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:45,277
<i>Rhinehart Inc. Is willing</i>
<i>to pay you $250,000, plus expenses.</i>

139
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:48,307
<i>Window seat or aisle?</i>

140
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:51,945
<i>...Islam has</i>
<i>issued a statement claiming responsibility.</i>

141
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,952
<i>We hope to bring you more on that</i>
<i>later in the bulletin.</i>

142
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,048
<i>Meanwhile, former British Prime Minister</i>
<i>Adam Lang is back in the news tonight.</i>

143
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,990
<i>According to leaked documents,</i>
<i>Mr. Lang authorized</i>

144
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,221
<i>the illegal use of British special forces</i>

145
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:08,322
<i>to seize four suspected al-Qaeda terrorists</i>
<i>in Pakistan</i>

146
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,167
<i>and then hand them over</i>
<i>for interrogation by the CIA.</i>

147
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:16,467
<i>The men, Nasir Ashraf, Marwat Sayed,</i>
<i>Salim Khan and Faruk Ahmed,</i>

148
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:21,479
<i>all British citizens, were seized in the</i>
<i>Pakistani city of Peshawar five years ago.</i>

149
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,009
<i>All four were allegedly transferred</i>
<i>out of the country</i>

150
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,518
<i>to a secret location and tortured.</i>

151
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,918
<i>Mr. Ashraf is reported to have died</i>
<i>under interrogation.</i>

152
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,081
<i>Such an operation</i>
<i>would have been illegal under...</i>

153
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:34,786
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Where are you?

154
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,226
<i>Heathrow, like you.</i>
<i>Waiting for my flight to New York.</i>

155
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,286
Can you see the news?

156
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,889
<i>The Lang story? Yeah, I'm watching it now.</i>

157
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:44,230
What have you gotten me into?

158
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:48,763
<i>I got you into a quarter of a million bucks,</i>
<i>pal, that's what I got you into.</i>

159
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,407
<i>They're calling my flight. I gotta go.</i>

160
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:51,942
Listen, I just realized

161
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,774
Sidney Kroll could have given me
that manuscript deliberately

162
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:57,713
so it would look like
I was carrying Lang's book.

163
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,044
<i>Why the hell would he do that?</i>

164
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,849
I don't know. To use me as a tethered goat?

165
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,852
<i>Get some sleep on the plane.</i>
<i>You're sounding weird.</i>

166
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,384
<i>"A tethered goat."</i>
<i>I'll call you next week.</i>

167
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:12,590
<i>...and long-term psychological trauma.</i>

168
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:14,131
<i>In other words, torture.</i>

169
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,860
Hello, sir.
Would you like a newspaper to read?

170
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:18,198
- Have you got the <i>Evening Standard?</i>
- We do, yes.

171
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:19,897
Thanks. Thank you.

172
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,900
Hello, madam.
Would you like a newspaper to read?

173
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,738
Yes, please. Thank you.

174
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:53,258
Passport?

175
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,255
This is an absolute scandal!

176
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:02,322
Amelia Bly. Welcome.

177
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,561
I'm Adam's assistant.

178
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:08,333
Adam's in New York, unfortunately,
and won't be back until later this afternoon.

179
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,068
Actually, forget I said that,
it's bloody ridiculous!

180
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,475
Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.
I'm afraid Ruth's having one of those days.

181
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,105
If this isn't a good time, I could go to...

182
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,376
No, no. She's keen to meet you.

183
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:23,052
- Right. Shall we make a start?
- Right.

184
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:27,221
- How was your journey?
- Long.

185
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,951
- We're a small team.
- Thanks.

186
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,393
This is Alice.

187
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,061
Lucy's traveling with Adam.

188
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:36,793
We need another pair of hands, but Adam
couldn't bring himself to replace Mike.

189
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,961
- They were together so long.
- How long were you with him?

190
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,437
Eight years.
I'm an attachment from Number 10.

191
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,131
Ah. Poor Number 10.

192
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:44,640
Before I show you the manuscript,

193
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,701
I need you to sign
this confidentiality agreement.

194
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,513
Sign here.

195
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:58,618
And here.

196
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,756
And here.

197
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,865
Wow, quite a place.

198
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,033
Don't you get Ionely at night?

199
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,802
It's my husband I miss the most.

200
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:21,038
Are you married?
I noticed you don't wear a wedding ring.

201
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,138
I can't, sadly. It's far too large.

202
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,378
- It bleeps when I go through airport security.
- Oh.

203
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,985
Here we are.

204
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:36,388
The manuscript is not to be removed
from this room. It's not to be copied.

205
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:40,898
You have six hours
before Adam gets in from New York.

206
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,866
- Can you finish by then?
- I'll try.

207
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,902
I'll ask Dep to bring you up
a sandwich for lunch.

208
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:47,995
Thanks.

209
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:54,705
Have fun.

210
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:05,586
"Langs are Scottish folk,
originally, and proud of it.

211
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:10,094
"Our name is a derivation of 'long,<i>'</i>
the Old English word for 'tall,<i>'</i>

212
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,597
"and it is from north of the border
that my forefathers hail."

213
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:15,288
Fuck.

214
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,400
"My great-grandfather, Ebenezer Lang,

215
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,237
"was born in 1862 in Pitlochry, Scotland.

216
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:25,276
"One of nine children, seven of them boys."

217
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,107
"The American President
was much taller than I had expected."

218
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:32,406
"This year's European summit
was particularly interesting."

219
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:35,384
"I always found the Queen, in private,
to have a delightful sense of humor."

220
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:55,599
Thanks.

221
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:23,491
"I've always been an optimist.
The present is where we live.

222
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:27,436
"Ruth and I look forward to the future,
whatever it may hold."

223
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,674
As bad as that?

224
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,204
Oh, hello.

225
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,741
Well? How bad is it?

226
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,340
You haven't read it?

227
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,779
Not all of it.

228
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:45,048
- Well, let's just say it needs some work.
- How much work?

229
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,218
Well, all the words are there.
They're just in the wrong order.

230
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,752
Come on. You look like you need a break.

231
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:58,057
You were my idea.

232
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:00,167
I was?

233
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,633
You wrote Christy Costello's memoirs,
didn't you?

234
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,332
You read those?

235
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:07,843
We stayed at his house in Mustique,
last winter.

236
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,373
The book was beside the bed.

237
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,211
- I'm embarrassed.
- No, why?

238
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:14,582
It was brilliant, in a horrible sort of way.

239
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:19,753
How you turned his ramblings
into something vaguely coherent.

240
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:24,623
I said to Adam, "Here's the guy
to write your book, not Mike."

241
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,732
God, I miss home.

242
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,702
It's like being married
to Napoleon on St. Helena.

243
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,808
- Why don't you go back to London?
- I don't feel I can leave him alone.

244
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:43,313
There's something not quite right
with him at the moment.

245
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:47,980
Amelia told me he was very upset
at the death of Michael McAra.

246
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:49,384
Oh, she did, did she?

247
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,223
Quite when Mrs. Bly became the expert
on my husband's emotions, I'm not sure.

248
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,191
Losing Mike was a blow, of course,

249
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:02,990
but it's not just that.

250
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:08,070
It's having to relive everything,
year by year, for this bloody book.

251
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,507
Oh, dear.

252
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:16,814
You must be wondering
what you've let yourself in for.

253
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,986
Fine, fine. I'll tell him.

254
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,645
They're just about to land.

255
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:24,846
On Thursday, he's in Chicago.

256
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,084
Actually, I think I'll go and meet him.

257
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:30,326
Amelia can stay here
and polish her nails or something.

258
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:32,486
Why don't you come, say hello?

259
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:36,691
Fine. I'll travel in the backup car.
I can do my nails in there.

260
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,545
Hi, darling.

261
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:28,551
- How was New York?
- Short and sweet.

262
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:30,747
Hi, Barry. Hi, Amelia.

263
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,686
Hello. Who are you?

264
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,919
I'm your ghost.

265
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:36,851
Right.

266
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:39,294
Don't worry. He isn't always such a jerk.

267
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:51,034
This place really comes alive at night.

268
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,538
You'll be with us for four weeks,
is that right?

269
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:24,632
I'm afraid so.

270
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,076
And the bill goes directly
to the Rhinehart Corporation?

271
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:28,134
Good.

272
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:30,613
That doesn't include the mini-bar.

273
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:16,722
All right. He's ready for you.

274
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,321
How's your hotel? Quiet?

275
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,492
Monastic.

276
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,798
That's nice. No distractions.

277
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:35,412
Thanks, love.

278
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,213
Hi, man. You ready to start?

279
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,615
Absolutely.

280
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,400
- Is the manuscript loaded on this?
- It is.

281
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:01,461
Can I have it?

282
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,473
I'm sorry,
that would be a security risk.

283
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,207
You mean I've got to retype
the whole manuscript?

284
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,644
Have you really got my entire book
on that little thing?

285
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:10,374
We can get 100 books on it, Adam.

286
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,645
And it can be copied in a flash.
That's the trouble.

287
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:14,945
Amazing.

288
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,414
You know the worst thing about my life?
You get so out of touch.

289
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,721
Everything's done for you.
You don't drive, you don't carry money.

290
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:25,092
If I need cash,
I have to borrow it from the protection boys.

291
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:28,092
This is the kind of details
we need in the memoirs.

292
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:31,328
I couldn't put that in.
People would think I was a complete idiot.

293
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:35,669
No, not at all. No, this shows what it's like
being Prime Minister.

294
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,537
That's exactly
what the readers want to know.

295
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:41,170
How does it feel to run a country?
How does it feel to be so cut off?

296
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,270
How does it feel to be so hated?

297
00:24:43,347 --> 00:24:44,679
Thanks a lot.

298
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,511
And so loved.

299
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,143
Amelia, what do you think?

300
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,779
I think I should leave you two alone.

301
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,228
So, how do we go about this?

302
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,926
I interview you.

303
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,738
I turn your answers into prose.

304
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,775
Here and there, I'll add linking passages,
imitating your voice.

305
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,933
Okay.

306
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:16,006
- You heard about Mike?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

307
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,179
We should put in
something nice about him.

308
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:24,188
I think his mother would like that.

309
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,621
Of course.

310
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:32,722
Well, um, the first thing that struck me was,

311
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,795
you became such a successful politician

312
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:37,460
precisely because
you didn't appear to be a politician.

313
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,163
It's certainly not something I wanted to do
when I was younger.

314
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,865
I thought most student politicians
were complete nerds.

315
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:46,205
Well, I'm with you there.
So, what turned you on to politics?

316
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:49,509
Turned me on, indeed.

317
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:56,847
Let's see, I was 23, something like that,
a couple of years out of Cambridge.

318
00:25:57,888 --> 00:26:01,518
And I remember it was a Sunday afternoon,
it was raining.

319
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:05,289
I was still in bed.
And someone starts knocking at the door.

320
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,227
And, you know,
I'd been out the night before

321
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,826
and had a few drinks and what have you.

322
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,701
So, I get the pillow and I put it
over my head, and it starts up again.

323
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:16,297
Knock, knock, knock, knock!

324
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:20,333
And I get up, I'm swearing,
I go to the door and there's this girl.

325
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,314
She's soaking wet, but she just launches
into this speech about the local elections.

326
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,905
And that's it.

327
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,915
- I'm in love.
- And this is Ruth?

328
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,316
This is Ruth.

329
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,961
And the only way I can see her again
is to join the party and hand out leaflets.

330
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,494
This is great.

331
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:40,556
You want to use this?

332
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,362
Use it? I think we should open
the whole book like this.

333
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:45,299
"I went into politics out of love,

334
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:49,534
"not love for a party or an ideology,
but out of love for a woman."

335
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,366
Could you transcribe this
as quickly as possible, please?

336
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:54,776
Of course.

337
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,644
- Thanks.
- How's it going?

338
00:26:56,714 --> 00:26:58,615
Pretty well. He keeps calling me "man."

339
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:01,709
He always does that
when he can't remember someone's name.

340
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,084
There are sandwiches in the kitchen.

341
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,199
Oh, shit.

342
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,008
It's awful.

343
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:10,047
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't realize there was anyone up there.

344
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,605
What on earth is going on?

345
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:14,277
It's just a security drill, sir.
We have it once a week.

346
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,048
So, there you are.
I'd rather lost track of you.

347
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,249
I'm a big boy now.
Can't keep your eye on me all the time.

348
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,815
Don't wander around on your own.
The security boys don't like it.

349
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,053
Gotcha.

350
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:29,430
- Did you win?
- Didn't play tennis. Gym.

351
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:34,805
Gym? What's he in training for?
The Olympics?

352
00:29:36,406 --> 00:29:38,307
Here's your transcript.

353
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,714
Cambridge. Let's talk about that.

354
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:50,380
Sorry? Um...

355
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:52,453
Cambridge?

356
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,051
It was such a long time ago,
I can hardly remember.

357
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:58,685
You did a lot of acting?

358
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,455
Some.

359
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:04,130
It must have been good training
for politics, acting?

360
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:06,567
It was a good way to meet girls.

361
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:09,128
Let's not put that in, by the way, okay?

362
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,903
Still, acting must have been
very important to you.

363
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,340
Okay, let's say I enjoyed it.

364
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,402
You know, you go on the stage,
pretend to be somebody else,

365
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,142
and people actually applaud you for it.

366
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:19,682
Good, that's more like it. Let's put that in.

367
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,775
- No.
- Why not?

368
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,717
Because these are the memoirs
of a Prime Minister.

369
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:25,017
And whenever my opponents were stuck
with something to hit me with,

370
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:27,147
they always said I was a bloody actor!

371
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:30,557
Do you know what the <i>Times of London</i>
said the day I resigned?

372
00:30:30,627 --> 00:30:32,561
"Kindly leave the stage."

373
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,224
So, no, we won't dwell, if you don't mind,
on my student days as an actor.

374
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,134
We leave it exactly the way Mike wrote it.

375
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:42,232
Would you like to take
a break for a minute?

376
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:45,640
Actually, that would be a good idea,
thank you. I need to make a call.

377
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,115
What a bastard.

378
00:31:04,394 --> 00:31:05,862
Look at this.

379
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:13,192
"Former British Foreign Secretary
Richard Rycart

380
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,330
"has asked the International Criminal Court
in The Hague to investigate allegations

381
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:18,432
"that the former British Prime Minister
Adam Lang

382
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,103
"ordered the illegal handover
of terrorist suspects

383
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:23,270
"for torture by the CIA."

384
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:25,709
Don't!

385
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,478
The pack is on the move.

386
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,385
Unplug all the phones.

387
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:35,915
Is Ruth still out walking?
Shit! She is, isn't she?

388
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:38,359
- Barry! Barry!
- Yeah.

389
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,921
Would you please find Mrs. Lang
and get her back here as soon as you can?

390
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,626
- Right.
- Let's go.

391
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,430
- Rycart has made a statement.
- Yes, I know.

392
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:47,835
- He just called me.
- It's unbelievable.

393
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,170
He wanted very much to let me know
it was nothing personal.

394
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,266
He wanted very, very much to tell me
that it was only

395
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:56,244
because of his well-known stand
on human rights

396
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,612
that he couldn't keep quiet any longer.

397
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:02,210
"His well-known stand on human rights."
Dear God!

398
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:11,288
- Sorry to lose my temper earlier.
- Forget it.

399
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,763
And have you told her?

400
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,733
- Yes. Just called her.
- And how did she take it?

401
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:20,066
Sorry, Adam. This is running on AP.

402
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:23,868
"According to sources in The Hague,

403
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,105
"the prosecutor's office
of the International Criminal Court

404
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,077
"will issue a statement in the morning."

405
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:30,443
Oh, Adam.

406
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:32,913
Thank you, Alice.

407
00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:36,146
Why weren't we given some warning
of this? Where's Downing Street?

408
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,346
The phones are disconnected.

409
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,945
Switch is probably
trying to get through now.

410
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:43,255
Now? What freaking use is now?
What are you people doing?

411
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:44,488
I mean, you're not telling me that

412
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:46,222
the Cabinet Office
didn't know this was coming?

413
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,460
The war crimes court doesn't warn
a suspect who's under investigation.

414
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,933
That's what Adam is now, a suspect?

415
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:53,265
You need to call Sid Kroll.

416
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:55,363
I think we should call London first.

417
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,932
Adam! If it suits them,
they will hang you out to dry.

418
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:01,136
You need a lawyer. Call Sid.

419
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:05,413
- Get Sid on the line.
- What about the media?

420
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,951
Issue a holding statement, something short.

421
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,816
This is when we need Mike.

422
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:11,650
I'll write something.

423
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:14,088
Let him do it.
He's supposed to be the writer.

424
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:16,455
- Hang on a minute.
- I should sound confident.

425
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:19,962
Not defensive, that'd be fatal.
But I shouldn't be cocky.

426
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,726
No bitterness, no anger, and don't say

427
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:25,234
I'm pleased at this opportunity
to clear my name or any balls like that.

428
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,634
So, you're not defensive,
but you're not cocky.

429
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:29,297
You're not angry, but you're not pleased?

430
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,968
- That's it.
- Then what exactly are you?

431
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,340
Told you he was funny.

432
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:39,247
I've always been a passionate supporter...

433
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,807
No, scrub that.

434
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:44,650
I've always been
a strong, no, committed supporter

435
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:48,157
of the work
of the International Criminal Court. Has he?

436
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:49,855
You're the writer.

437
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:52,520
The struggle against terror is too important

438
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:55,724
to be used for the purposes
of personal revenge.

439
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:59,732
Very good.
You could be the new Mike McAra.

440
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:03,439
- Hello?
- <i>John Maddox.</i>

441
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:07,273
<i>This is gonna be big.</i>
<i>This can only be good for us.</i>

442
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,041
- Could be.
<i>- Here's the first chapter right here.</i>

443
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,342
Okay.

444
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,509
<i>What've you covered so far?</i>

445
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:14,809
Um...

446
00:34:15,452 --> 00:34:17,784
The early years, childhood, university.

447
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,688
<i>All right, forget that crap.</i>
<i>Get him focused on the war crimes.</i>

448
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:23,521
<i>And he can't talk to anybody else, all right?</i>

449
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,425
- Right.
<i>- It's gotta be our exclusive.</i>

450
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,157
<i>Any chance of you</i>
<i>finishing the manuscript sooner?</i>

451
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,219
Sooner?

452
00:34:28,298 --> 00:34:30,027
<i>Yeah, yeah, sooner.</i>

453
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,134
Well, how much sooner?

454
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:34,068
<i>I'm thinking two weeks.</i>

455
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,634
Jesus.

456
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:40,001
<i>Look, I know it's tough,</i>
<i>but if anyone can do it, you can.</i>

457
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,409
<i>I'm relying on you. We'll talk.</i>

458
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:50,911
Shit.

459
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:57,590
I'd never have guessed you smoked.

460
00:34:57,661 --> 00:35:01,358
I only allow myself one
at times of great stress or contentment.

461
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:03,865
- And which is this?
- Very funny.

462
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:06,266
Maddox just called. He wants the book
in two weeks instead of four.

463
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:07,565
Christ. Good luck.

464
00:35:07,637 --> 00:35:11,164
Yeah, I wouldn't mind a lift back to my
hotel. I could get on with some work there.

465
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,708
You're not planning on
taking that manuscript

466
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,641
- out of here, are you?
- Course not.

467
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:17,579
Because you do realize
how serious this is getting, don't you?

468
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,617
- You can search me, if you like.
- That won't be necessary.

469
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,880
All right. Fetch your stuff.
I'll get one of the boys to take you.

470
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,559
<i>Mr. Lang insisted he had always been</i>
<i>a committed supporter</i>

471
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:32,596
<i>of the work</i>
<i>of the International Criminal Court.</i>

472
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,255
<i>Mr. Lang added, quote,</i>

473
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:36,664
<i>"The struggle against terror</i>
<i>is too important</i>

474
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:39,327
<i>"to be used for the purposes</i>
<i>of personal revenge."</i>

475
00:35:39,402 --> 00:35:41,371
- Same again, sir?
<i>- This is being widely interpreted as...</i>

476
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:42,871
- Yes, thanks.
<i>...an attack on the former British</i>

<i>Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart,</i>
<i>who has asked...</i>

478
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,670
Could we change the channel?

479
00:35:47,744 --> 00:35:49,735
- Sure.
- Thanks.

480
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:53,271
<i>At issue is the practice</i>
<i>of so-called waterboarding,</i>

481
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,478
<i>an interrogation technique</i>
<i>considered a war...</i>

482
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,588
- Something to eat?
- What've you got?

483
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:04,219
- Club sandwich. Clam chowder.
- Chowder will be fine.

484
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,286
You're English?

485
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:12,992
And so are you.

486
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:14,936
Indeed I am.

487
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:18,403
- You here on a holiday?
- No, I'm working.

488
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,239
So, what's your line?

489
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,706
Just this and that. Excuse me.

490
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,750
I hear Adam Lang's on the island.

491
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,452
Is he?

492
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,853
So I hear.

493
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:37,525
You don't happen to know
his whereabouts, do you?

494
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:38,619
No.

495
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:42,230
No, I'm afraid not. If you don't mind.

496
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,460
<i>Raymond to Naslund and to Mattias Ohlund.</i>

497
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:49,130
<i>A slap pass to Lukas Krajicek.</i>
<i>He's in trouble against</i>

498
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:52,574
<i>Barret Jackman and the referee...</i>

499
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,739
Asshole.

500
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:58,336
<i>...and Ohlund can't hold it in again,</i>
<i>and this power play is just about over.</i>

501
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,884
<i>Keith Tkachuk almost set to come back on.</i>

502
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,614
Hello?

503
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:50,594
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

504
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:54,570
Yeah, can you tell me,
has anyone gone up to my room?

505
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,697
No, sir.

506
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,865
- Did anyone ask for me?
- No.

507
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:03,170
What about that other guest? The, um...

508
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:06,007
There's an Englishman.

509
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,778
You're the only guest in the hotel, sir.

510
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,492
- Hello?
- <i>You need to check out</i>

511
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,331
<i>of the hotel immediately.</i>

512
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:28,599
<i>Things have changed. A car is on its way.</i>

513
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:29,798
What?

514
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,474
<i>See you then.</i>

515
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,637
Hello?

516
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:04,672
- Okay.
- Just check on that. Okay?

517
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:14,980
- It's getting big, huh?
- So I see.

518
00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:17,577
Who're you with?

519
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,313
I'm on my own.

520
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,791
Oh, sod it. Here we go again.

521
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:35,771
<i>You've reached the office</i>
<i>of Rick Ricardelli. Leave a message.</i>

522
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,570
Hi, Rick.
Now they want the book in two weeks.

523
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,077
Thanks for getting me this job.

524
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:43,909
Can't talk.
Some peace protestors are trying to kill me.

525
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:47,780
You're working for a murderer!
You're working for a murderer!

526
00:39:49,452 --> 00:39:51,887
Liar! Liar! Liar!

527
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:59,586
- Are you ill?
- No, I'm aging.

528
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,889
This place is Shangri-La in reverse.

529
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,460
I tried to call you
several times last night.

530
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,661
You didn't answer.

531
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,465
I forgot to charge my mobile phone.

532
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,733
Really? And the hotel phone?

533
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:11,967
I'm a heavy sleeper.

534
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:14,567
Well, you can do your heavy sleeping here
from now on.

535
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:16,806
- Here?
- We're under siege.

536
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,371
You can't run the media gauntlet every day.

537
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:23,909
Eventually, they'll discover who you are.
And that would be horrid for you.

538
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,360
So, this is where you put the granny.

539
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:35,456
No.

540
00:40:36,132 --> 00:40:38,465
This is where we put Mike McAra.

541
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:48,472
We haven't had a chance to clear it yet.
The sheets have been changed, though.

542
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:51,173
Actually, I make it a rule
never to stay in a client's house.

543
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:54,307
But now you can have constant access
to the manuscript.

544
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,443
Isn't that what you want?

545
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:57,817
Besides, Sid Kroll
will be arriving any minute.

546
00:40:57,887 --> 00:41:01,289
Why don't you settle in,
and then come up and join us?

547
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,985
- You're practically one of us now.
- I am?

548
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:08,121
You drafted the statement yesterday.
That makes you an accomplice.

549
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,561
So, here's the score. You're not being
charged, you're not being arrested.

550
00:41:14,637 --> 00:41:16,003
None of this is gonna amount
to a hill of beans.

551
00:41:16,072 --> 00:41:17,869
The only thing the prosecutor is asking for

552
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,967
is permission to launch
a formal investigation.

553
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:22,273
- Investigating me for what?
- Connie?

554
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,246
Either crimes against humanity
or war crimes.

555
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,010
Well, that's absurd.
It's not exactly genocide.

556
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,985
"Under Article 25,
a person shall be guilty of a war crime

557
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,715
"if that person facilitates the commission
of such a crime

558
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:35,452
"or aids, abets or otherwise assists
in its commission."

559
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:38,222
- That's rather sweeping.
- Well, if it's any comfort,

560
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,753
you're in no jeopardy
as long as you stay here, among friends.

561
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:44,130
Are you saying
I can't leave the United States?

562
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:47,829
As your attorney, I strongly advise you
not to travel to any country

563
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,965
that recognizes the jurisdiction
of the International Criminal Court.

564
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,509
Well, just about every country in the world
recognizes the ICC.

565
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:54,737
America doesn't.

566
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:56,438
- Who else?
- Josh?

567
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,449
Iraq, China, North Korea, Indonesia, Israel.

568
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,976
- And that's it?
- There are some parts of Africa.

569
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:05,146
Wait!

570
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:08,713
<i>I wish to make a short statement.</i>
<i>I won't be taking questions.</i>

571
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:11,226
<i>This morning, I was granted power</i>
<i>to investigate</i>

572
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,856
<i>the former British Prime Minister,</i>
<i>Mr. Adam Peter Bennett Lang,</i>

573
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:20,632
<i>under Articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 Rome</i>
<i>Statute of the International Criminal Court.</i>

574
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,099
<i>I shall shortly be contacting Mr. Lang</i>
<i>and the British government</i>

575
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:26,108
<i>to ask for their full cooperation. Thank you.</i>

576
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:35,675
Oh, God.

577
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,152
Okay, we need to get you to Washington,
Adam, right away.

578
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,449
My plane is at the airport.

579
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,786
We can get you in to see
the Speaker of the House at lunchtime

580
00:42:41,858 --> 00:42:44,293
and have a photo-op
with the Secretary of State in the afternoon.

581
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,226
Won't it look as if I'm panicking?

582
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,423
No, they'll both say
that the meetings were fixed weeks ago.

583
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:49,931
Well, what the hell
are we supposed to be discussing?

584
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,230
AIDS? Poverty? Climate change?

585
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:55,329
Who cares? The important thing
is to show the world it's business as usual.

586
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:58,534
- What do you think, Ruth?
- I think it's a terrible idea.

587
00:42:58,608 --> 00:43:00,201
You'll look as though
you're America's whipping boy,

588
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,835
running crying home to daddy.

589
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:04,574
- So, what would you do?
- Fly to London.

590
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:06,981
The government will support you.

591
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:11,317
"The British government
will cooperate fully with the investigation."

592
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,054
Really? And what makes you think that?

593
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,019
I'm not thinking it, Ruth, I'm reading it.

594
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,552
<i>...believe we can now go live</i>
<i>to the UN in New York,</i>

595
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,293
<i>where the former British Foreign Secretary,</i>
<i>Richard Rycart,</i>

596
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:26,063
<i>is about to make a statement.</i>

597
00:43:26,135 --> 00:43:29,469
<i>I watched the announcement in The Hague</i>
<i>today with great shock and sadness.</i>

598
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:31,940
<i>Adam Lang was</i>
<i>and is an old friend of mine.</i>

599
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,567
You cheeky bugger!

600
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:36,976
<i>I regret that he's chosen to bring this down</i>
<i>to a personal level.</i>

601
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,708
<i>This isn't personal. This is about justice.</i>

602
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,016
<i>This is about making sure</i>
<i>every political leader knows</i>

603
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:44,610
<i>when they make a decision,</i>

604
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,521
<i>they will be held to account</i>
<i>by international law.</i>

605
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,081
<i>Thank you.</i>

606
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,989
<i>If you're called to testify, sir, will you go?</i>

607
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:54,496
- <i>Certainly, I'll go.</i>
- Of course you will, you little shit!

608
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,795
That settles it. Washington it is.

609
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,532
I still say it'll look bad.

610
00:43:58,601 --> 00:44:01,469
Not as bad as being led away
from Heathrow in handcuffs.

611
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:02,766
It would show you had some guts.

612
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,773
Well, then why the hell
don't you just fly back without me?

613
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:08,641
If the British government wants to hand me
over to this kangaroo court, then sod them!

614
00:44:08,711 --> 00:44:10,942
I'll go where people want me.

615
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:15,213
Amelia, tell the boys we're leaving.
Have one of the girls pack me a bag.

616
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:17,184
You'd better pack one for yourself.

617
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:20,815
Why don't you share a suitcase?
It's so much more convenient.

618
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:49,681
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm sorry to abandon you.

619
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:52,085
At least this might help sales.

620
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,713
Perhaps Rhinehart's PR department
organized the whole thing.

621
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,188
Well, tell them to stop it, will you?

622
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:08,367
Okay, people,
remember, happy, happy faces.

623
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:19,306
<i>So, just to summarize</i>
<i>what we know so far, it's now official,</i>

624
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,210
<i>the special prosecutor</i>
<i>of the International War Crimes Court</i>

625
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,878
<i>is to launch an investigation...</i>

626
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,858
<i>...the special prosecutor announced</i>
<i>she was going to investigate Mr. Lang,</i>

627
00:45:30,927 --> 00:45:33,452
<i>well, there was a big cheer, I can tell you.</i>

628
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,793
<i>So, let's talk to some of these protestors.</i>

629
00:45:35,865 --> 00:45:38,061
<i>- You, sir, you're English, I believe.</i>
<i>- I am.</i>

630
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,601
<i>So, what brings you so far from home?</i>

631
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,197
<i>My son. He was killed</i>
<i>in one of Mr. Lang's illegal wars.</i>

632
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,907
<i>Lang's never visited the injured.</i>
<i>He's never apologized.</i>

633
00:45:46,976 --> 00:45:50,139
<i>I was in the British Army for 30 years.</i>
<i>It's a disgrace!</i>

634
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,710
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Can I ask you the same question?</i>

635
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:54,875
<i>You're a murderer, Lang!</i>
<i>You're a war criminal!</i>

636
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,284
Liar, liar, liar!

637
00:45:57,353 --> 00:45:59,253
<i>Lang, Lang, Lang!</i>

638
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:01,085
Killer, killer, killer!

639
00:46:01,157 --> 00:46:04,820
- <i>Lang, Lang, Lang!</i>
- Liar, liar, liar!

640
00:46:05,161 --> 00:46:10,327
- <i>Lang, Lang, Lang!</i>
- Killer, killer, killer!

641
00:46:12,835 --> 00:46:13,961
Over here, Mr. Lang!

642
00:46:14,036 --> 00:46:17,097
I apologize for keeping you waiting so long
in the cold.

643
00:46:17,173 --> 00:46:19,505
What's your reaction
to Mr. Rycart's statement?

644
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:23,842
<i>I'd like to say a few words</i>
<i>in response to the news from The Hague.</i>

645
00:46:24,947 --> 00:46:29,851
<i>These are strange times when</i>
<i>those who stand for freedom and justice</i>

646
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,114
<i>are accused of being criminals,</i>

647
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:36,387
<i>while those who incite hatred</i>
<i>and seek to destroy democracy</i>

648
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,519
<i>- are treated as victims.</i>
- <i>War criminal!</i>

649
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,224
<i>Let me make one thing perfectly clear.</i>

650
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,931
<i>While I have breath in my body,</i>
<i>I shall fight terrorism...</i>

651
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:48,994
<i>Liar!</i>

652
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:53,634
<i>...whether it's on the battlefield</i>
<i>or, if necessary, in the courts.</i>

653
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:55,836
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

654
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:58,403
<i>Have you spoken</i>
<i>to the President, Mr. Lang?</i>

655
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:26,695
Oh, for God's sake.

656
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:35,070
God.

657
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,496
Shit!

658
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:39,773
One minute!

659
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,106
Yes?

660
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,951
Sir? You want lunch?

661
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:54,217
That would be great.
Give me five minutes, thanks.

662
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:18,411
P. Emmett?

663
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,141
<i>Richard Rycart.</i>

664
00:50:57,253 --> 00:50:58,721
<i>Who is this?</i>

665
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,822
- Dep?
- Sir?

666
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,130
Is there a map of the island
that I could borrow?

667
00:51:57,847 --> 00:51:59,815
Look. It's rain soon.

668
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:02,248
I don't know. I think it will be all right.

669
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:07,416
Why don't you take the car?
It's for guests. Here's the key.

670
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:11,416
- For our guests, it's very nice car.
- Oh. Yes.

671
00:52:11,494 --> 00:52:14,396
Mr. McAra loved this car very, very much.

672
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:18,422
Do you know... I'm gonna take the...
I'm gonna take the bicycle. Thanks.

673
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:20,163
This is... Just a moment, just a moment.

674
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:25,038
It's rain. I give...
I give you my hat and my gloves.

675
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,469
- That's very kind, thank you.
- Good luck for you.

676
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:30,411
- Thank you. Thank you, yeah, bye.
- Bye-bye.

677
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:02,804
Just one moment.

678
00:54:26,028 --> 00:54:27,963
God, you frightened me.

679
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,824
- You're British.
- I am, yeah.

680
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:34,168
It's okay, you can shelter. Sheltering's free.

681
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,405
No, no, no, no! Rosie, Rosie!

682
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,407
In you go. In, in.

683
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,335
Here.

684
00:54:44,713 --> 00:54:47,114
- So, you're British, huh?
- Yeah.

685
00:54:47,516 --> 00:54:51,476
- You anything to do with this fellow, Lang?
- In a way, yes.

686
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,215
Seems intelligent.

687
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,621
Now why did he go
and get himself mixed up

688
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,284
with that damn fool in the White House?

689
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,123
Well, that's what everyone wants to know.

690
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:02,186
What brings you to this part of the island?

691
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:04,556
I'm sightseeing.

692
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:08,469
Well, you sure picked a heck of a day for it.

693
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:12,974
Someone I knew was found washed up
on the beach there.

694
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:16,570
- You mean the British guy from the ferry?
- That's right.

695
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:20,443
- Now that was a funny business.
- What do you mean?

696
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,543
No way should that current have carried him
that far west.

697
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:26,349
- No?
- No way!

698
00:55:26,422 --> 00:55:27,913
Are you sure?

699
00:55:28,657 --> 00:55:30,853
I've lived here 54 years.

700
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,192
Did you mention that to the police?

701
00:55:33,262 --> 00:55:37,858
The police? At my age,
I've better things to do, young man.

702
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,932
Annabeth's the one dealing with the police.

703
00:55:41,003 --> 00:55:42,164
Your wife?

704
00:55:42,237 --> 00:55:46,298
Annabeth Wurmbrand,
Mars Wurmbrand's widow.

705
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:50,206
She's the one
who told them about the lights.

706
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:54,012
- Lights?
- The flashlights on the beach.

707
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:58,019
- When?
- The night the body was washed up.

708
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:02,387
Could, could you, um...

709
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:06,126
Could you point me in the direction
of Mrs. Wurmbrand's house?

710
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,226
Oh, sure. You just...

711
00:56:08,797 --> 00:56:11,289
Here. Follow it down the beach there.

712
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:14,565
It's the house nearest the ocean.
But she won't talk to you.

713
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:17,400
- Why not?
- She's in a coma.

714
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,731
Fell down stairs a week ago.

715
00:56:21,143 --> 00:56:23,771
Been in a coma ever since.

716
00:57:05,387 --> 00:57:06,855
Come down!

717
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:17,630
Come down!

718
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,929
Dep told me you were here!

719
00:57:24,373 --> 00:57:25,601
What?

720
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:29,371
I said Dep told me you were here.

721
00:57:29,445 --> 00:57:32,472
We came to get you before the storm came.
What are you doing?

722
00:57:32,548 --> 00:57:34,449
- Just taking the air.
- No, really.

723
00:57:34,516 --> 00:57:36,985
I wanted to see
where Mike McAra was found.

724
00:57:37,052 --> 00:57:38,144
Why?

725
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:41,815
Adam's asked me
to write something about him in the book.

726
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:44,485
- Where's your bike?
- Up there.

727
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:47,155
Barry, will you come around with the car?
We'll meet you out by the road.

728
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,925
I can't do that, I'm afraid, Mrs. Lang.
Have to stay with you at all times.

729
00:57:49,998 --> 00:57:51,898
For God's sake!

730
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:53,833
If we meet any terrorists, I'll text you.

731
00:57:53,902 --> 00:57:56,336
All right, well, stay on the path.
Don't speak to anyone.

732
00:57:56,405 --> 00:57:59,375
We won't talk to a soul, Officer, I promise.

733
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:07,407
Poor Mike. I can't bear the idea of him
ending up so far from home.

734
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:11,719
I wonder if we'll ever know
whether it was accident or suicide.

735
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,153
Can't help you. I never met him.

736
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,753
I suppose it doesn't really matter.

737
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:21,853
He was drunk. He drowned. End of story.

738
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:26,635
- What was he doing on the ferry?
- No idea.

739
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,567
Funeral's on Monday, in London.

740
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:35,869
I'm thinking of going.

741
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,139
One of us should put in an appearance,

742
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,579
and it doesn't seem likely
to be my husband.

743
00:58:39,648 --> 00:58:40,911
I thought you didn't want to leave him.

744
00:58:40,983 --> 00:58:44,476
Rather seems as though he's left me,
wouldn't you say?

745
00:59:56,626 --> 01:00:00,117
- Hello?
- Sorry. I did knock. It's just me.

746
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:04,063
- I brought you some dry clothes.
- That's all right. I can manage.

747
01:00:04,132 --> 01:00:06,260
Dinner's in an hour, okay?

748
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:11,204
Fine, thanks. For God's sake.

749
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:32,992
<i>"It was at the time</i>
<i>of the London elections</i>

750
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:35,291

754
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:49,538
Mmm.

755
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:53,347
- Perfect fit. Now all you need is a drink.
- What are we having?

756
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:57,784
Biodynamic white wine from
the Rhinehart Vinery in the Napa Valley.

757
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:04,922
Rhinehart. He doesn't
own a distillery, I suppose?

758
01:01:08,463 --> 01:01:10,659
Mmm. Evening news.

759
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,994
<i>...for war crimes.</i>
<i>Our political editor has more.</i>

760

Christ, we're the lead story.

01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:19,030
Pour us some more wine, will you?

762
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:21,677
I may have to get drunk for a change.

<i>Thank you very much, indeed.</i>
<i>It's good to see you.</i>

770
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,197
Don't grin.

<i>In Iraq, a suicide bomber...</i>

772
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:48,731
For God's sake!

773
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,010
Adam.

774
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,684
Calling to find out how I think it went.

775
01:02:08,757 --> 01:02:11,420
- Let him sweat.
- Does he always ask for your advice?

776
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:12,960
Yes,

777
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,159
and always usually takes it.

778
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,722
Until lately.

779
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:23,233
- Are you married?
- Certainly not.

780
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,331
- Gay?
- No.

781
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,938
- Did you have a...
- I had a... Um...

782
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:32,139
- What? Girlfriend?
- Well, a bit more than that.

783
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:33,545
Partner?

784
01:02:34,349 --> 01:02:35,715
A bit less than that.

785
01:02:35,784 --> 01:02:37,615
I don't know,
40,000 years of human language

786
01:02:37,686 --> 01:02:39,847
and there's no word
to describe our relationship.

787
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,115
It was doomed.

788
01:02:43,925 --> 01:02:45,951
Come on. Let's eat.

789
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,063
- How's it going?
- The book?

790
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:57,496
- Well, it's not, to be honest.
- Sit there.

791
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,501
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

792
01:03:02,043 --> 01:03:05,103
I find it difficult
to understand certain things.

793
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:07,672
- What things?
- Well...

794
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:12,382
I can't understand
why this good-Iooking lad

795
01:03:12,454 --> 01:03:16,447
who goes to Cambridge
without the slightest interest in politics

796
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:20,293
and who spends his time acting
and chasing girls,

797
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:22,860
- suddenly ends up...
- Married to me?

798
01:03:22,931 --> 01:03:25,833
Oh, no, not that. No, not that, at all.

799
01:03:27,402 --> 01:03:29,597
No, what I don't get

800
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:33,039
is why, at 22,
he's suddenly a political activist.

801
01:03:33,108 --> 01:03:35,838
- I mean, where does that come from?
- Didn't you ask him?

802
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:38,574
He said he joined the party because of you.

803
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,445
Told me a great story about you
turning up at his place in the rain.

804
01:03:41,516 --> 01:03:44,349
- I was gonna start the whole book with it.
- And now you're not?

805
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,445
No, I can't. It's not true.

806
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:51,318
- Isn't it?
- Well, you know it's not.

807
01:03:51,793 --> 01:03:53,818
He'd been a member for two years
before he met you.

808
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:55,726
How do you know that?

809
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:59,523
I've got a copy
of his original party membership card.

810
01:04:01,036 --> 01:04:03,597
Mike McAra found it in the archives.

811
01:04:03,672 --> 01:04:07,438
Typical Mike, to ruin a good story
with too much research.

812
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,501
Did he find anything else?

813
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:12,012
Not much. Cambridge stuff mainly.

814
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:17,474
You were more political than he was.

815
01:04:17,552 --> 01:04:21,010
I was certainly a change
from his Cambridge girlfriends.

816
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,717
All those Jocastas and Pandoras.

817
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:26,728
And so his marriage to you
must have been pretty vital,

818
01:04:26,795 --> 01:04:29,356
your knowledge
and your contacts in the party.

819
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:32,230
And I thought he married me for my body.

820
01:04:35,637 --> 01:04:39,074
Did you ever want to be
a proper politician in your own right?

821
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:42,338
Of course.
Didn't you want to be a proper writer?

822
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:44,835
Ouch.

823
01:04:46,815 --> 01:04:50,251
I'm sorry. I've hurt your feelings.

824
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:54,320
I suppose even ghosts must have feelings.

825
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:56,916
We are sensitive spirits.

826
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,791
Talking of spirits, could you...

827
01:05:02,664 --> 01:05:04,132
Let me get you a proper drink.

828
01:05:13,275 --> 01:05:16,268
White wine,
never really seen the point of it.

829
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,177
That's the sort of thing Mike used to say.

830
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,842
Ah! At last, something in common.

831
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,956
Do you know the coroner reckoned
he'd drunk nearly half a bottle?

832
01:05:28,023 --> 01:05:29,684
That's convenient.

833
01:05:30,492 --> 01:05:32,960
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

834
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,762
- You think his death was suspicious?
- Don't you?

835
01:05:40,835 --> 01:05:41,961
Yes.

836
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,471
Yes, I do.

837
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:51,806
Today at the beach,

838
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:55,739
I met a man, an old timer
who was familiar with the currents.

839
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:57,581
And he said that there was no way

840
01:05:57,652 --> 01:06:00,985
that a body from the ferry
could have washed ashore on that spot.

841
01:06:01,056 --> 01:06:02,081
You're kidding.

842
01:06:02,157 --> 01:06:06,356
He also said that there was a woman who
saw flashlights on the beach that night.

843
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:10,297
And then she fell down the stairs,
and now she's in a coma. That's all I know.

844
01:06:10,365 --> 01:06:13,300
That's all you know? Jesus.

845
01:06:18,907 --> 01:06:20,876
- Can I borrow your phone?
- Why?

846
01:06:21,543 --> 01:06:23,340
I need to call Adam.

847
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,777
- What?
- Nothing.

848
01:06:31,853 --> 01:06:35,255
- Aren't you gonna call him?
- Later. I'm going out for a walk.

849
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,918
But it's pitch black. It's pouring with rain.

850
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,018
- It'll clear my head.
- Well, I'll come with you.

851
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:43,827
No. Thanks, but I need to work this one
through on my own.

852
01:06:43,898 --> 01:06:46,867
Stay here. Have another drink.
Don't wait up.

853
01:07:08,556 --> 01:07:10,047
Are you awake?

854
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,088
- Well, I am now.
- I'm sorry.

855
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:18,094
It's all right. Hang on.

856
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:25,565
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

857
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:29,432
I called Adam.

858
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:33,880
- And?
- Can I come in?

859
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:50,427
The day before Mike died,

860
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:53,326
he and Adam had a terrible row.

861
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,494
I've never told anyone this before,
not even the police.

862
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,596
- What about?
- I don't know.

863
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:02,003
But it was furious. They never spoke again.

864
01:08:05,547 --> 01:08:08,949
When I asked Adam about it,
he refused to discuss it.

865
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:14,514
After what you just said,
I felt I should ask him again.

866
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,887
And what did he say?

867
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,788
He was having dinner
with the Vice President.

868
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:23,354
That bloody Bly woman
wouldn't even give him the phone.

869
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,297
Oh, God. Oh, dear God.

870
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:31,033
What's he got himself mixed up in?

871
01:08:31,106 --> 01:08:34,975
It's all right. Everything'll be all right.

872
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,478
I'm scared.

873
01:08:39,747 --> 01:08:43,309
I've never been scared in my life before,
but I am now.

874
01:08:45,186 --> 01:08:49,283
Your hair's all wet, you're drenched.
Let me get you a towel.

875
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:06,930
Bad idea.

876
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,344
Do you mind?

877
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,578
Course not.

878
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,765
The modesty of the morning after?

879
01:10:14,842 --> 01:10:16,572
I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep.

880
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:18,805
You mean you thought I'd be gone?

881
01:10:34,162 --> 01:10:38,327
You've taken out the family tree.
He's very proud of the Langs.

882
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:42,597
You know, if you want a family tree,
go to a garden center.

883
01:10:44,606 --> 01:10:47,006
Why have you underlined my name
every time?

884
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,373
I was surprised
there wasn't more about you.

885
01:10:49,444 --> 01:10:51,970
Why? I'm just the wife.

886
01:10:52,347 --> 01:10:55,180
Yeah, even so.
You ought not to be written out of history.

887
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,014
Why not? Most women are.

888
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,145
Then I'll reinstate you.

889
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:01,551
I'll put in all the occasions
that he's forgotten.

890
01:11:01,623 --> 01:11:06,027
How kind. Like the boss's secretary
that remembers his wife's birthday for him?

891
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:10,429
Something like that. But then,
like you say, I'm not a proper writer.

892
01:11:10,498 --> 01:11:13,059
- What are you planning to do?
- Leave.

893
01:11:14,936 --> 01:11:16,904
It's not necessary, as far as I'm concerned.

894
01:11:16,971 --> 01:11:19,462
I'm afraid it is, as far as I am.

895
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,237
- Where will you go?
- Back to the hotel.

896
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:25,972
Look, I'm sorry. I should never have stayed
in a client's house.

897
01:11:26,047 --> 01:11:29,814
- It always ends up with...
- With you screwing the client's wife?

898
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:31,853
No, not always.

899
01:11:32,453 --> 01:11:34,649
But it does make it hard
to maintain a professional distance.

900
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:39,386
And the thing we discussed last night?
What do you propose to do about that?

901
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:43,192
- That's none of my business.
- Well, you can't just ignore it.

902
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:47,429
Look, I'm his ghostwriter.
I'm not an investigative reporter.

903
01:11:47,502 --> 01:11:51,166
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Perhaps I'll write my own memoirs.

904
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:53,140
<i>Ex-Prime Minister's Wife Tells All.</i>

905
01:11:53,207 --> 01:11:54,903
Well, if you ever decide to do that,
give me a call.

906
01:11:54,976 --> 01:11:57,411
You think I need someone like you
to produce my book?

907
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:00,380
I don't want to be in his bloody memoirs.

908
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:03,744
He's on his own. I'll get a divorce.

909
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:06,645
And she can do the prison visits.

910
01:12:41,222 --> 01:12:42,952
Morning, sir.

911
01:12:43,024 --> 01:12:46,118
- Finished for the night, have we?
- Why don't you just piss off?

912
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,146
<i>BMW ConnectedDrive.</i>

913
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,274
<i>Traffic is clear to your destination.</i>

914
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:02,060
<i>Join the road when possible.</i>

915
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:23,118
<i>In 200 yards, turn left.</i>

916
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:26,182
Sorry, lady, but the hotel is right.

917
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,395
<i>Turn around when possible.</i>

918
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:34,595
This is getting ridiculous.

919
01:14:55,623 --> 01:14:57,353
<i>Turn around when possible.</i>

920
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,189
All right, you win.

921
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:16,443
<i>In 50 yards, turn left.</i>

922
01:15:23,985 --> 01:15:25,475
<i>Turn left.</i>

923
01:15:26,654 --> 01:15:28,713
You've got to be joking.

924
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:44,769
Single or return?

925
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,774
Return. I hope.

926
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,738
Forty bucks, please.

927
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:52,475
- Have a good one.
- Ta.

928
01:16:16,137 --> 01:16:18,970
Okay, come on. Come on, keep coming.

929
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,376
A little more. Stop.

930
01:16:51,038 --> 01:16:53,632
<i>In 50 yards, turn left.</i>

931
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:04,145
<i>Please proceed to the indicated road.</i>

932
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:07,279
<i>In 200 yards, take the next exit.</i>

934
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:12,690
<i>Turn left.</i>

01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:17,895
<i>In 200 yards,</i>
<i>you will have reached your destination.</i>

936
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:27,507
<i>You have reached your destination.</i>

937
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:38,811
Paul Emmett?

938
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:44,850
Professor Paul Emmett?

939
01:18:49,256 --> 01:18:51,885
"Professor Paul Emmett
of Harvard University

940
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,394
"has written of the unique importance
of the English-speaking peoples

941
01:18:54,462 --> 01:18:56,863
"in the spread of democracy
around the world.

942
01:18:56,931 --> 01:18:59,092
"As these nations stand together,

943
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:02,966
"whenever they have faltered,
tyranny has gathered strength."

944
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:49,507
<i>Hello?</i>

945
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:51,574
- Is that Mrs. Emmett?
<i>- Who is this?</i>

946
01:19:51,685 --> 01:19:53,949
I wondered if I might have a word
with Professor Emmett.

947
01:19:54,021 --> 01:19:55,353
<i>Do you have an appointment?</i>

948
01:19:55,422 --> 01:19:59,051
It's about Adam Lang.
I'm assisting him with his memoirs.

949
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:01,462
<i>Just a moment, please.</i>

950
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:08,067
<i>This is Paul Emmett.</i>
<i>I think you must have made a mistake.</i>

951
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,399
But you were at Cambridge with Mr. Lang?

952
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:14,601
<i>We were contemporaries, yes,</i>
<i>but I can't claim to know him.</i>

953
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:17,235
I have a photograph of you together.

954
01:20:18,579 --> 01:20:20,274
<i>Come on up to the house.</i>

955
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:53,143
I make it a rule never to see anyone
without an appointment.

956
01:20:53,614 --> 01:20:57,448
But your mention of a photograph
rather tickled my curiosity.

957
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:02,885
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

958
01:21:03,457 --> 01:21:05,483
Yes, he's here now.

959
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,789
- May I?
- Sure.

960
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:11,596
Yes. Yes, he's on his own.

961
01:21:12,466 --> 01:21:13,990
He didn't say.

962
01:21:14,735 --> 01:21:16,533
British, about 40.

963
01:21:16,604 --> 01:21:20,506
Well, well.
I literally have no recollection of this.

964
01:21:20,908 --> 01:21:22,536
- But that is you?
- Yes, it is.

965
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:25,807
I was on the board of the Dramat.
I had quite a time of it, as you can imagine.

966
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:30,011
- The Dramat?
- I'm sorry. The Yale Dramatic Association.

967
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:32,052
I maintained my theatrical interests

968
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:35,418
when I went to Cambridge
for my doctoral research.

969
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,822
- Could I keep this?
- No, I'm afraid not.

970
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:43,990
- I'm sure I could get you a copy.
- Would you? That would be kind.

971
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,430
Maybe you could tell me
how you came by it.

972
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:49,162
I'd be happy to.

973
01:21:52,006 --> 01:21:53,804
Come into my study.

974
01:21:58,212 --> 01:22:00,680
Yes, the wall of ego.

975
01:22:01,448 --> 01:22:04,782
We all have one.
It's our equivalent of the dentist's fish tank.

976
01:22:07,354 --> 01:22:08,787
Have a seat.

977
01:22:17,097 --> 01:22:18,689
So, the picture.

978
01:22:18,766 --> 01:22:19,859
Um...

979
01:22:20,935 --> 01:22:22,926
I've been working with Adam Lang
on his memoirs.

980
01:22:23,003 --> 01:22:25,063
Yes, I know, you told me.

981
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:29,974
Yes, poor Lang. It's bad business,
this posturing by The Hague.

982
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:33,877
As for Rycart, the worst
British Foreign Secretary since the war.

983
01:22:33,948 --> 01:22:35,074
Lang was right to fire him.

984
01:22:35,149 --> 01:22:38,016
- How well do you know Lang?
- Hardly at all.

985
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,519
- You seem surprised.
- He mentions you in his memoirs.

986
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:43,851
Oh, really?

987
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:49,296
Well, now it's my turn to be surprised.
What does he say?

988
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:09,748
That's very decent of him.

989
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:13,150
As Prime Minister,
he always had good instincts.

990
01:23:13,887 --> 01:23:15,354
- But that doesn't mean I know him.
- But the...

991
01:23:15,422 --> 01:23:18,448
That. That was taken at a reception
in London

992
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:21,520
to mark the 10-year anniversary
of the Arcadia.

993
01:23:21,595 --> 01:23:24,029
- Arcadia?
- Yeah, it's a little organization that I ran.

994
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:26,863
Very highbrow.
No reason why you should have heard of it.

995
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:30,029
The Prime Minister graced us
with his presence.

996
01:23:30,204 --> 01:23:33,765
What can you remember of him
from Cambridge?

997
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:38,042
- I'm sorry, you don't mind, do you?
- No, not at all. Go ahead.

998
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:40,604
It's just that I'm rather bewildered.

999
01:23:40,681 --> 01:23:44,048
No one's mentioned the Cambridge
connection between us in all these years.

1000
01:23:44,118 --> 01:23:47,747
- But you performed together?
- In one production.

1001
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:52,121
It was the summer revue.
I can't even remember what it was called.

1002
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:55,753
- Can I show you something else?
- Lf you must.

1003
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:05,604
Oh, my.

1004
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,135
Is that what I think it is?

1005
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:11,203
Let's hope he didn't inhale.

1006
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:13,144
But that is you standing behind him,
isn't it?

1007
01:24:13,213 --> 01:24:14,703
I do believe it is.

1008
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:17,877
And I do believe I'm on the point
of issuing a stern warning to him

1009
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:20,181
on the perils of drug abuse.

1010
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:25,192
Is Mr. Lang really going to use
these pictures in his memoirs?

1011
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,194
If so, I would prefer it if I weren't named.

1012
01:24:28,595 --> 01:24:30,291
My children would be mortified.

1013
01:24:30,364 --> 01:24:32,890
They're so much more puritanical
than we were.

1014
01:24:32,966 --> 01:24:36,801
- Can you tell me about any of the others?
- No, I'm afraid not.

1015
01:24:37,137 --> 01:24:40,301
The whole summer is a blur,
a very happy blur.

1016
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:45,409
Now, you were going to tell me
about these pictures.

1017
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,310
I got them from Michael McAra.

1018
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,778
And he is whom, exactly?

1019
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:54,320
My predecessor on Lang's memoirs.

1020
01:24:55,122 --> 01:24:57,682
- He resigned?
- No, he died.

1021
01:24:58,592 --> 01:24:59,992
I'm sorry to hear that.

1022
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:03,689
Yes, a couple of weeks ago.
He drove up here to see you.

1023
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:05,658
And he died a few hours afterwards.

1024
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:09,190
He drove up to see me?
No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

1025
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:12,963
- How did he die?
- He drowned.

1026
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,439
Poor fellow.

1027
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:20,344
I've never really believed the myth that
death by drowning is painless, have you?

1028
01:25:20,414 --> 01:25:22,905
Seems to me it must be agonizing.

1029
01:25:23,518 --> 01:25:25,452
And the police never said anything to you
about this?

1030
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,988
I've had no contact with the police.

1031
01:25:28,055 --> 01:25:29,819
But were you here that weekend?

1032
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:32,121
This would have been
January, the 11th and 12th.

1033
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:40,199
A less equable man than I might start
to find your questions impertinent.

1034
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:46,569
Nancy?

1035
01:25:48,775 --> 01:25:49,935
Nancy?

1036
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:54,479
Our visitor wishes to know where we were
on the 11th and 12th of January.

1037
01:25:54,548 --> 01:25:56,914
Do we possess that information?

1038
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:06,453
That was the Colorado weekend.

1039
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:10,393
Yes, of course, the Aspen Institute.

1040
01:26:10,998 --> 01:26:14,127
Bipolar relationships in a multi-polar world.

1041
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:17,466
- Sounds fun.
- Yes, it was. I was the main speaker.

1042
01:26:17,538 --> 01:26:19,006
Look, just to return to Cambridge...

1043
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:22,564
No, if you don't mind,
let's not return to Cambridge.

1044
01:26:23,043 --> 01:26:25,979
I've said all I have to say on that subject.

1045
01:26:27,548 --> 01:26:31,645
I'm an avid reader of political memoirs.
I'll get hold of Mr. Lang's when they appear.

1046
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:34,654
Perhaps he'll send you a copy,
for old time's sake.

1047
01:26:34,721 --> 01:26:36,349
I doubt that very much.

1048
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:38,581
The gate will open automatically.

1049
01:26:38,659 --> 01:26:42,255
Be sure to make a right
when you get to the end of the drive.

1050
01:26:42,329 --> 01:26:44,957
If you turn left, the road
will take you deeper into the woods

1051
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,399
and you may never be seen again.

1052
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:10,820
<i>BMW ConnectedDrive.</i>

1053
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:27,225
When is the last ferry?

1054
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:30,287
- You're just in time.
- Here, I've got a return.

1055
01:29:30,364 --> 01:29:31,729
All right.

1056
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:23,676
- Ticket?
- Uh...

1057
01:30:25,252 --> 01:30:26,880
- Okay.
- Okay.

1058
01:30:58,653 --> 01:30:59,949
Shit.

1059
01:32:13,226 --> 01:32:14,591
Hey, you! Stop!

1060
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:16,686
Don't do that! Where you going?

1061
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:20,164
Man, get out of here!
Get out of here, asshole!

1062
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:23,229
Shit!

1063
01:33:09,684 --> 01:33:12,551
<i>You've reached the office</i>
<i>of Rick Ricardelli. Leave a message.</i>

1064
01:33:12,619 --> 01:33:13,881
Piss off.

1065
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:29,536
What can I do for you, sir?

1066
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,435
You wouldn't happen to know
if there are any flights leaving

1067
01:33:31,505 --> 01:33:32,563
the airport tonight, would you?

1068
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,573
Not unless you've got your own private jet.

1069
01:33:34,641 --> 01:33:36,609
I lent it to my butler.

1070
01:33:36,676 --> 01:33:38,234
You Brits!

1071
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:42,173
There's a flight to Boston

1072
01:33:42,248 --> 01:33:44,149
- 8:30 tomorrow morning.
- Shit!

1073
01:33:46,052 --> 01:33:48,520
- How much for a room?
- For you, $89.

1074
01:33:49,823 --> 01:33:52,690
- I'll pay cash.
- Who's got your card? The nanny?

1075
01:34:29,095 --> 01:34:30,586
<i>You rang back.</i>

1076
01:34:33,234 --> 01:34:35,667
<i>Are you going to stay on the line this time?</i>

1077
01:34:35,735 --> 01:34:36,793
Yes.

1078
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:39,206
<i>I've been trying to call you.</i>

1079
01:34:40,274 --> 01:34:42,002
I know, I'm sorry...

1080
01:34:43,644 --> 01:34:45,770
It didn't seem right, speaking to you.

1081
01:34:46,212 --> 01:34:47,612
<i>Who are you?</i>

1082
01:34:48,448 --> 01:34:51,212
I'm the new ghostwriter...

1083
01:34:51,284 --> 01:34:53,515
<i>No names, don't use any names.</i>

1084
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:56,051
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

1085
01:34:57,557 --> 01:35:01,858
It was in my predecessor's effects.

1086
01:35:03,229 --> 01:35:04,355
The...

1087
01:35:05,198 --> 01:35:07,257
The thing is, I'm in trouble.

1088
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:09,234
<i>Is it because of your client?</i>

1089
01:35:10,203 --> 01:35:11,329
Yeah.

1090
01:35:12,073 --> 01:35:14,734
There's something wrong,
but I didn't know who to talk to.

1091
01:35:14,809 --> 01:35:18,073
<i>Where are you? Without being too specific.</i>
<i>On the island?</i>

1092
01:35:18,145 --> 01:35:23,515
I'm in the... No, I'm on the mainland,
on the... This motel by the ferry.

1093
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:24,983
<i>Room number?</i>

1094
01:35:29,622 --> 01:35:30,783
201.

1095
01:35:30,858 --> 01:35:33,189
<i>- Have you got the book with you?</i>
- Yeah.

1096
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:34,886
<i>Okay. Stay there.</i>

1097
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:31,081
Hatherton?

1098
01:36:50,237 --> 01:36:53,899
<i>With $35 billion of funds at its disposal,</i>

1099
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:56,703
<i>the Hatherton Group brings together</i>
<i>a family of companies</i>

1100
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:59,244
<i>devoted to defense and security.</i>

1101
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:01,804
<i>And with unrivaled expertise</i>
<i>in the Middle East,</i>

1102
01:37:01,881 --> 01:37:04,645
<i>including the services</i>
<i>of two former Presidents,</i>

1103
01:37:04,717 --> 01:37:08,518
<i>three Prime Ministers</i>
<i>and two directors of the CIA,</i>

1104
01:37:08,588 --> 01:37:13,150
<i>Hatherton is proud to stand at the forefront</i>
<i>of the struggle against terror.</i>

1105
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:18,328
<i>Hatherton, a shelter from harm.</i>

1106
01:37:58,005 --> 01:38:01,532
"According to CIA whistleblower
Frank Molinari,

1107
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:03,667
"Yale graduate Paul Emmett

1108
01:38:03,743 --> 01:38:07,645
"was reported to have joined the Agency
as an officer in 1971,

1109
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:12,050
"and was assigned to the Foreign
Resources Division of the Directorate of..."

1110
01:38:12,819 --> 01:38:14,150
1971?

1111
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:18,018
It's 1974.

1112
01:38:34,707 --> 01:38:36,470
- Hello?
- <i>You're alive.</i>

1113
01:38:38,244 --> 01:38:39,302
Yeah, just about.

1114
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:41,074
<i>I've been worried sick.</i>

1115
01:38:41,148 --> 01:38:44,548
<i>The police called to say</i>
<i>they'd found the car on the ferry. Again!</i>

1116
01:38:44,618 --> 01:38:48,917
I'm so sorry. I parked it,
and then, and then I got off the boat.

1117
01:38:48,988 --> 01:38:51,957
<i>What the hell were you doing</i>
<i>on the mainland, anyway?</i>

1118
01:38:52,025 --> 01:38:54,654
- I drove to New York.
<i>- Why?</i>

1119
01:38:55,895 --> 01:38:58,023
I needed to see John Maddox.

1120
01:38:58,265 --> 01:38:59,926
<i>And where are you now?</i>

1121
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,730
I'm still at the ferry terminal.
I missed the last crossing.

1122
01:39:04,037 --> 01:39:06,096
<i>You really are bloody hopeless!</i>

1123
01:39:06,172 --> 01:39:09,471
<i>I just had Adam on the phone,</i>
<i>trying to get hold of you.</i>

1124
01:39:09,542 --> 01:39:13,137
<i>He's flying back tonight.</i>
<i>He sounds in a right state.</i>

1125
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:15,676
<i>You didn't tell him about us, did you?</i>

1126
01:39:15,748 --> 01:39:16,806
God's sake, Ruth!

1127
01:39:18,217 --> 01:39:20,708
I've got to go. I'll call you back.

1128
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:29,126
- Who is it?
- Mr. Rycart sent me.

1129
01:39:30,096 --> 01:39:31,291
Hold on.

1130
01:40:01,161 --> 01:40:03,788
Just gonna do a quick check,
if you don't mind.

1131
01:40:17,944 --> 01:40:20,105
Get your stuff together. We're leaving.

1132
01:40:24,251 --> 01:40:26,150
Hey! That's private!

1133
01:40:49,042 --> 01:40:51,136
- He's clean.
- Thanks, Frank.

1134
01:40:55,481 --> 01:40:58,451
Sorry about that. Please, get in.

1135
01:41:14,435 --> 01:41:17,597
- You thought it was a trap?
- It crossed my mind.

1136
01:41:17,671 --> 01:41:18,899
You do work for Lang.

1137
01:41:18,971 --> 01:41:20,962
Yeah, for three days. I hardly know the guy.

1138
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:25,841
Who does? I worked for him for 15 years,
till he fired me, and I still can't fathom him.

1139
01:41:25,912 --> 01:41:27,813
Yeah, his wife said more or less the same.

1140
01:41:27,881 --> 01:41:32,476
There you go. If someone as sharp as Ruth
can't get him, what hope do we have?

1141
01:41:32,552 --> 01:41:35,146
- Tough day?
- Yeah, you could say that.

1142
01:41:35,555 --> 01:41:37,113
You have the book?

1143
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:39,082
Yeah.

1144
01:41:39,592 --> 01:41:40,992
He's got it.

1145
01:41:48,202 --> 01:41:52,536
Before we go any further, I wonder
if I might take a look at that book.

1146
01:41:57,077 --> 01:42:01,639
No. Before we go any further,
there's a few things I'd like to know first.

1147
01:42:01,715 --> 01:42:04,615
Such as,
why did Mike McAra have your number?

1148
01:42:09,256 --> 01:42:10,621
Okay. Sure.

1149
01:42:11,425 --> 01:42:12,891
He was helping me.

1150
01:42:13,793 --> 01:42:14,920
McAra? How?

1151
01:42:14,994 --> 01:42:18,555
Mike found the documents linking Lang
to the torture flights.

1152
01:42:18,631 --> 01:42:20,259
What? It was McAra
who gave you the documents?

1153
01:42:20,333 --> 01:42:24,600
- Yeah, Mike McAra. The loyalest of the loyal.
- But why?

1154
01:42:24,671 --> 01:42:28,231
He didn't like discovering
he was working for a war criminal.

1155
01:42:28,307 --> 01:42:29,604
Would you?

1156
01:42:30,543 --> 01:42:32,408
Oh, I forgot. You are.

1157
01:42:34,715 --> 01:42:35,943
The book?

1158
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:07,145
Well, don't tell me
you're gonna read it now.

1159
01:43:07,213 --> 01:43:09,613
Not all of it. Just the beginning.

1160
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:12,377
There's something very important about it.

1161
01:43:12,452 --> 01:43:14,976
Yeah. It's the cure for insomnia.

1162
01:43:15,055 --> 01:43:18,149
There you go, guys.
Can I get you anything else?

1163
01:43:18,225 --> 01:43:19,817
No, thanks, love.

1164
01:43:23,896 --> 01:43:28,425
Mike said he'd discovered something new.
It's the last time he called me.

1165
01:43:28,801 --> 01:43:32,260
He said it explained everything that had
gone wrong when we were in government.

1166
01:43:32,338 --> 01:43:35,034
- What was it?
- He wouldn't say over the phone.

1167
01:43:35,108 --> 01:43:39,943
He just kept saying if anything happened
to him, the truth was in Lang's memoirs.

1168
01:43:40,314 --> 01:43:41,975
"It's all there in the beginning."

1169
01:43:42,048 --> 01:43:43,573
The beginning?

1170
01:43:44,685 --> 01:43:46,653
Then he means Cambridge.

1171
01:43:58,532 --> 01:43:59,828
What the hell's this?

1172
01:43:59,899 --> 01:44:02,698
That is Lang, and that is Paul Emmett.

1173
01:44:03,069 --> 01:44:06,061
Emmett? The Arcadia guy. So what?

1174
01:44:06,139 --> 01:44:09,801
On the day that Mike McAra died,
he drove up to see Emmett,

1175
01:44:10,243 --> 01:44:12,144
and I think he was murdered
on his way home.

1176
01:44:12,212 --> 01:44:13,577
- What?
- I went to see Emmett today,

1177
01:44:13,646 --> 01:44:16,877
and two guys followed me from his house.
That's why I called you.

1178
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:20,586
At the time that this photograph was taken,

1179
01:44:21,154 --> 01:44:25,090
Paul Emmett was an officer in the CIA.

1180
01:44:25,591 --> 01:44:26,615
Emmett?

1181
01:44:26,693 --> 01:44:29,662
- Foreign Resources Division.
- Oh, my God.

1182
01:44:31,297 --> 01:44:33,993
You realize how important this is,
don't you?

1183
01:44:34,434 --> 01:44:37,301
This explains why Lang went into politics.

1184
01:44:37,804 --> 01:44:41,604
Everyone knows he didn't have
a political thought in his pretty little head.

1185
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:46,873
This is why he rose so quickly,
with a little help from his friends.

1186
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:49,711
- Well, do you think it's possible...
- Okay, a quiz for you.

1187
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:53,219
Name one decision Lang made in 10 years
as Prime Minister

1188
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:56,051
which wasn't in the interests of the USA.

1189
01:44:57,757 --> 01:45:00,555
Well, come on, it's not a trick question.

1190
01:45:01,127 --> 01:45:04,791
Iraq, Middle East policy, Star Wars defense,

1191
01:45:05,698 --> 01:45:09,190
buying American nuclear missiles,
support of terrorist rendition.

1192
01:45:09,269 --> 01:45:12,898
The sacking of any minister
Washington didn't like,

1193
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:15,270
including yours truly.

1194
01:45:15,876 --> 01:45:17,467
McAra was right.

1195
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:19,411
This explains everything.

1196
01:45:24,251 --> 01:45:25,842
It's Amelia Bly.

1197
01:45:26,353 --> 01:45:27,684
Answer it.

1198
01:45:29,789 --> 01:45:33,122
- Hello, Amelia.
<i>- Good evening. I have Adam for you.</i>

1199
01:45:34,461 --> 01:45:35,621
Lang.

1200
01:45:35,962 --> 01:45:37,554
<i>We're coming to get you.</i>

1201
01:45:37,631 --> 01:45:38,756
What?

1202
01:45:39,198 --> 01:45:41,599
<i>Ruth tells me</i>
<i>you're stuck at the ferry terminal.</i>

1203
01:45:41,667 --> 01:45:43,761
<i>We've just taken off from New York.</i>

1204
01:45:43,837 --> 01:45:46,635
<i>Pilot says we can stop by and pick you up.</i>

1205
01:45:47,239 --> 01:45:49,435
Really? There's no need.

1206
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:51,738
<i>We've got a book to write, remember?</i>

1207
01:45:53,412 --> 01:45:55,039
Hold on a sec, Adam.

1208
01:45:57,083 --> 01:45:59,814
He said he wants to
pick me up in his private jet.

1209
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:01,786
- Say yes.
- What if it's a trap?

1210
01:46:01,854 --> 01:46:05,086
If you refuse, he'll get suspicious.
Tell him yes.

1211
01:46:07,461 --> 01:46:11,420
That'd be great, Adam. Yeah, thanks.
I'll get to the airport.

1212
01:46:11,965 --> 01:46:13,431
<i>See you there.</i>

1213
01:46:15,469 --> 01:46:17,130
He sounds worried.

1214
01:46:18,604 --> 01:46:20,162
I really don't think this is a good idea.

1215
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:21,434
You have no choice.

1216
01:46:21,507 --> 01:46:23,533
Emmett must have told Lang
that I'd been to see him.

1217
01:46:23,609 --> 01:46:25,975
So, what's he gonna do about it?
Dump you in the ocean?

1218
01:46:26,046 --> 01:46:28,844
- Well, it happened before!
- Which means it can't happen again.

1219
01:46:28,914 --> 01:46:33,113
He can't drown two ghostwriters,
for God's sake. You're not kittens.

1220
01:46:35,756 --> 01:46:38,350
All this is just theory.
We don't have any proof.

1221
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:40,619
- You'll get us the proof.
- Me?

1222
01:46:40,694 --> 01:46:43,219
You're his ghostwriter.
Presumably, he lets you tape him.

1223
01:46:43,296 --> 01:46:45,525
- I use discs, actually.
- Discs, tapes.

1224
01:46:45,599 --> 01:46:47,896
You've got to confront him with this.
Record his reaction.

1225
01:46:47,967 --> 01:46:49,697
Even if he denies it, it's something.

1226
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:53,899
I'm in a tricky position here.
I signed a confidentiality agreement.

1227
01:46:53,974 --> 01:46:55,032
It's a bit late for that.

1228
01:46:55,108 --> 01:46:58,372
- It means the discs are his property.
- The court can subpoena them.

1229
01:46:59,145 --> 01:47:01,739
And what if I don't record any discs?

1230
01:47:01,814 --> 01:47:04,443
Then you'll be subpoenaed
and forced to repeat this whole story.

1231
01:47:04,518 --> 01:47:05,609
Then I'll deny it.

1232
01:47:05,685 --> 01:47:07,676
Then I'll give them this.

1233
01:47:10,289 --> 01:47:12,417
Frank is recording every word.

1234
01:47:12,492 --> 01:47:14,118
Aren't you, Frank?

1235
01:47:17,697 --> 01:47:19,186
Oh! Come on!

1236
01:47:19,265 --> 01:47:21,096
Don't look so shocked.
What did you expect?

1237
01:47:21,167 --> 01:47:23,568
That I'd come into a meeting
with a man working for Lang

1238
01:47:23,636 --> 01:47:25,832
without taking any precautions?

1239
01:47:26,472 --> 01:47:29,203
Except you're not working
for Lang anymore.

1240
01:47:29,275 --> 01:47:31,176
You're working for the good guys.

1241
01:47:32,912 --> 01:47:35,073
You know all this is pointless, don't you?

1242
01:47:35,614 --> 01:47:38,845
In the end, he'll just retire over here
with his CIA pension,

1243
01:47:38,918 --> 01:47:42,582
and he'll tell you and the bloody
war crimes court to go and fuck yourselves.

1244
01:47:56,235 --> 01:47:59,399
Good evening, sir.
Hatherton welcomes you aboard.

1245
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,136
Thank you.

1246
01:48:02,576 --> 01:48:04,440
It's my first time in a private jet.

1247
01:48:04,511 --> 01:48:06,376
Well, let's hope it's not your last.

1248
01:48:18,425 --> 01:48:19,653
Hi, man.

1249
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:22,828
- Take your seat.
- Thanks.

1250
01:48:24,230 --> 01:48:27,722
- Hey, bring my ghost a Calvados.
- Yes, sir.

1251
01:48:49,021 --> 01:48:50,216
Do you mind?

1252
01:48:50,289 --> 01:48:52,087
Leave it off for now.

1253
01:48:52,658 --> 01:48:55,594
Ruth said you were in New York
to see Maddox.

1254
01:48:57,029 --> 01:48:58,895
- That's right.
- How was he?

1255
01:48:59,765 --> 01:49:00,823
He was fine.

1256
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:02,390
Full of energy?

1257
01:49:02,702 --> 01:49:05,193
- You know John.
- Yes, I do know John.

1258
01:49:06,605 --> 01:49:09,336
As a matter of fact, I was just with him.

1259
01:49:09,408 --> 01:49:11,809
You never saw him today, did you?

1260
01:49:13,712 --> 01:49:14,770
No.

1261
01:49:15,448 --> 01:49:17,313
Do you have something to tell me?

1262
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:19,146
I went to see Emmett.

1263
01:49:19,252 --> 01:49:22,516
That windbag! Why?

1264
01:49:22,588 --> 01:49:24,021
I know about you and Emmett.

1265
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:26,057
- Me and Emmett?
- I know that he was your...

1266
01:49:26,126 --> 01:49:28,822
- My?
...handler, if that's what they're called.

1267
01:49:28,895 --> 01:49:32,524
- My handler?
- Yeah, that he was your handler in the CIA.

1268
01:49:43,443 --> 01:49:45,569
Oh, my God.

1269
01:49:47,613 --> 01:49:49,707
You're serious, aren't you?

1270
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:01,787
When McAra found this,
he went to Boston to show it to Emmett,

1271
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:05,421
and he died on the way home,
and I think he was murdered.

1272
01:50:05,998 --> 01:50:08,796
I think you've had a few too many
of those already.

1273
01:50:08,868 --> 01:50:13,100
It was McAra who believed that Emmett told
you to go into politics in the first place.

1274
01:50:13,172 --> 01:50:15,300
- Emmett? I barely knew the man.
- And that story of yours

1275
01:50:15,375 --> 01:50:19,208
about why you joined the party and Ruth
and the canvassing, well, the dates don't fit.

1276
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:21,109
I got the dates wrong. Big deal!

1277
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:22,648
Then when he found this photograph,

1278
01:50:22,716 --> 01:50:24,842
and he heard the rumors
about Emmett being in the CIA...

1279
01:50:24,917 --> 01:50:26,715
- Rumors?
- It's on the Internet.

1280
01:50:26,786 --> 01:50:30,085
I've never heard such utter balls
in my entire life.

1281
01:50:31,658 --> 01:50:36,652
Mike would never have believed such crap.
He was too clever. Too loyal.

1282
01:50:37,329 --> 01:50:39,457
Mike betrayed you to Rycart.

1283
01:50:43,737 --> 01:50:45,966
- How do you know that?
- He told me.

1284
01:50:46,905 --> 01:50:48,065
Rycart?

1285
01:50:50,076 --> 01:50:51,407
He's lying.

1286
01:50:56,181 --> 01:50:59,618
This phone number on the back
of the photograph, it's Rycart's.

1287
01:51:00,252 --> 01:51:03,449
The handwriting, that's McAra's.

1288
01:51:04,157 --> 01:51:05,248
Mike.

1289
01:51:07,226 --> 01:51:09,854
- Mike, Mike.
- And you knew he was disillusioned.

1290
01:51:09,929 --> 01:51:11,555
You had a big row with him
just before he died.

1291
01:51:11,631 --> 01:51:15,658
Yes, I know, but he never mentioned this.
This is just... This is grotesque.

1292
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:18,896
I've never taken orders from anyone.

1293
01:51:18,971 --> 01:51:22,032
Whatever I did,
I did because I believed it was right.

1294
01:51:22,108 --> 01:51:24,702
What, even supporting illegal kidnapping
for torture?

1295
01:51:24,778 --> 01:51:28,737
Oh, for God's sake,
spare me the bleeding-heart bullshit!

1296
01:51:28,814 --> 01:51:30,805
Do you know what I'd do
if I was in power again?

1297
01:51:30,884 --> 01:51:32,976
I'd have two queues at airports.

1298
01:51:33,052 --> 01:51:36,021
One for flights
where we'd done no background checks,

1299
01:51:36,088 --> 01:51:40,957
infringed on no one's civil bloody liberties,
used no intelligence gained by torture.

1300
01:51:41,027 --> 01:51:44,519
And on the other flight,
we'd do everything we possibly could

1301
01:51:44,596 --> 01:51:46,292
to make it perfectly safe.

1302
01:51:46,365 --> 01:51:49,163
And then we'd see which plane
the Rycarts of this world

1303
01:51:49,234 --> 01:51:50,997
would put their bloody kids on!

1304
01:51:51,070 --> 01:51:52,868
And you can put that in the book!

1305
01:52:19,498 --> 01:52:20,726
Go home!

1306
01:52:21,234 --> 01:52:22,757
Go home!

1307
01:52:24,002 --> 01:52:25,868
Here comes the killer!

1308
01:52:25,939 --> 01:52:28,737
Prosecute for torture!

1309
01:52:28,807 --> 01:52:30,274
Over here, Mr. Lang!

1310
01:52:30,342 --> 01:52:33,641
Mr. Lang!
Mr. Lang, will you live in America?

1311
01:52:36,181 --> 01:52:38,672
Mr. Lang, will you take
American citizenship?

1312
01:52:43,389 --> 01:52:46,289
When we get back to the house,
we need to have a meeting.

1313
01:52:49,295 --> 01:52:51,194
- Oh, my God!
- Murderer!

1314
01:52:51,264 --> 01:52:52,730
Firing from the roof!

1315
01:52:57,904 --> 01:53:01,930
Let me go to him! No! No!

1316
01:53:05,177 --> 01:53:06,805
Move, move, move!

1317
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:48,850
How long had you known Mr. Lang?

1318
01:53:48,921 --> 01:53:51,447
- Couple of days.
- In what capacity?

1319
01:53:51,524 --> 01:53:53,219
I was his ghost.

1320
01:53:53,292 --> 01:53:54,885
His ghostwriter.

1321
01:53:56,729 --> 01:53:58,492
Do you recognize this man?

1322
01:54:00,166 --> 01:54:04,125
He was one of the protestors.
His son was killed in Iraq.

1323
01:54:04,203 --> 01:54:06,137
Did you ever speak with him?

1324
01:54:06,206 --> 01:54:08,730
He was in the bar one night
in the hotel where I was staying.

1325
01:54:08,807 --> 01:54:10,537
But did you speak with him?

1326
01:54:10,609 --> 01:54:12,770
He asked me if I knew where Adam Lang
was staying on the island.

1327
01:54:12,845 --> 01:54:16,282
- I told him that I didn't.
- Did you report this conversation?

1328
01:54:16,349 --> 01:54:17,372
Sorry?

1329
01:54:17,449 --> 01:54:19,975
Did you report this conversation
to Mr. Lang's protection team?

1330
01:54:20,052 --> 01:54:21,077
No.

1331
01:54:21,421 --> 01:54:23,650
What was Mr. Lang's demeanor
this evening?

1332
01:54:23,722 --> 01:54:26,953
He was... He was fine. He seemed fine.

1333
01:54:27,894 --> 01:54:30,988
One witness said she thought
she heard Mr. Lang shouting at you.

1334
01:54:31,663 --> 01:54:32,721
No.

1335
01:55:00,525 --> 01:55:02,960
- We're gonna need your passport.
- Why?

1336
01:55:03,029 --> 01:55:06,930
A serious crime was just committed
in US territory, and you're the key witness.

1337
01:55:13,206 --> 01:55:14,935
We need to keep you close.

1338
01:55:19,912 --> 01:55:23,576
<i>Like a fallen soldier,</i>
<i>Adam Lang went home today,</i>

1339
01:55:23,649 --> 01:55:26,311
<i>home to a shocked and grieving nation.</i>

1340
01:55:26,819 --> 01:55:32,051
<i>Not just his family, but friends</i>
<i>and political opponents joined in tribute.</i>

1341
01:55:32,125 --> 01:55:35,390
<i>A great colleague and a true patriot.</i>

1342
01:55:36,128 --> 01:55:40,155
<i>We had our disagreements,</i>
<i>but we always stayed friends.</i>

1343
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,664
<i>My heart goes out to Ruth and the family.</i>

1344
01:55:44,304 --> 01:55:46,966
<i>And I would like to say Adam will be...</i>

1345
01:55:55,648 --> 01:55:56,739
Who is it?

1346
01:55:56,815 --> 01:55:58,408
Congratulations!

1347
01:56:00,453 --> 01:56:01,578
On what now?

1348
01:56:01,654 --> 01:56:03,884
Still having me as your agent. Hmm?

1349
01:56:06,059 --> 01:56:07,890
They don't need you anymore.

1350
01:56:09,862 --> 01:56:11,658
You're free to go.

1351
01:56:16,868 --> 01:56:19,962
- You ready to get back to work?
- I don't think I can, Rick.

1352
01:56:20,038 --> 01:56:22,734
- I'm sorry. Not after all this.
- Don't be a jerk.

1353
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:27,576
This is a hot book now.
It's Adam Lang's voice from the grave.

1354
01:56:27,646 --> 01:56:30,309
- The guy, he's a hero.
- I just want to go home.

1355
01:56:30,382 --> 01:56:31,680
You can.

1356
01:56:31,751 --> 01:56:35,448
Go. Go home.
And finish the book from London.

1357
01:56:39,024 --> 01:56:40,515
I don't know, Rick.

1358
01:57:04,817 --> 01:57:06,216
Here we are.

1359
01:57:06,652 --> 01:57:08,243
Oh, here we are.

1360
01:57:19,966 --> 01:57:21,296
I'm sorry.

1361
01:57:22,268 --> 01:57:25,533
I think I'm over it,
and then suddenly I realize I'm not.

1362
01:57:27,105 --> 01:57:30,939
- Are you sure this is all right?
- Of course. My invitation said plus one.

1363
01:57:31,010 --> 01:57:34,069
Only I wondered if you might've wanted
to bring your husband.

1364
01:57:34,146 --> 01:57:35,636
That didn't work out.

1365
01:57:36,082 --> 01:57:39,984
I hadn't appreciated quite how bored
he was with being my plus one.

1366
01:57:44,489 --> 01:57:46,390
- Shall we go in?
- Yeah.

1367
01:57:53,099 --> 01:57:55,498
- Amelia Bly, plus one.
- Thank you.

1368
01:58:00,605 --> 01:58:02,869
That was a bit of a turn-up, for the books,
you calling me.

1369
01:58:02,942 --> 01:58:04,932
I heard you weren't invited,
and I thought you should be here.

1370
01:58:05,011 --> 01:58:07,240
Ghosts are never invited
to the launch party, as a rule.

1371
01:58:07,313 --> 01:58:10,338
We're an embarrassment.
Like a mistress at a wedding.

1372
01:58:11,917 --> 01:58:13,078
Sorry.

1373
01:58:14,886 --> 01:58:16,582
I brought you a present.

1374
01:58:18,757 --> 01:58:20,055
Thank you.

1375
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:30,534
That's very funny.

1376
01:58:30,603 --> 01:58:32,365
I thought, seeing as
you were so keen to hold onto it,

1377
01:58:32,438 --> 01:58:33,734
you might like it as a souvenir.

1378
01:58:33,805 --> 01:58:36,707
Between you and me, it wasn't us,
it was the Americans.

1379
01:58:36,775 --> 01:58:40,212
They thought the book was
a potential threat to national security.

1380
01:58:40,279 --> 01:58:41,337
But there's nothing in it.

1381
01:58:41,413 --> 01:58:44,439
Something about the beginnings.
I think that's what I heard.

1382
01:58:44,516 --> 01:58:47,645
- The beginning?
- No, beginnings. The beginnings.

1383
01:58:49,421 --> 01:58:50,445
Beginnings?

1384
01:59:01,067 --> 01:59:02,556
You all right?

1385
01:59:03,269 --> 01:59:06,136
Do you know that man?
The one who's speaking to Ruth.

1386
01:59:06,338 --> 01:59:08,899
- Paul Emmett?
- What's he doing here?

1387
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:11,671
Well, he was Ruth's tutor at Harvard
when she was a Fulbright scholar.

1388
01:59:11,743 --> 01:59:13,336
Why shouldn't he be here?

1389
01:59:19,051 --> 01:59:21,280
Do you mind if I have that back a second?

1390
01:59:25,123 --> 01:59:26,386
I'm...

1391
01:59:30,796 --> 01:59:32,661
- Madam?
- No, thank you.

1392
01:59:55,054 --> 01:59:57,078
"Langs are Scottish folk, originally."

1393
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:10,792
"Wife and child in tow, I decided to...

1394
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:12,793
"I decided to settle."

1395
02:00:12,872 --> 02:00:16,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention, please.

1396
02:00:17,342 --> 02:00:21,712
Thank you.
I'd like to ask Ruth Lang to say a few words.

1397
02:00:25,850 --> 02:00:27,876
I miss Adam all the time.

1398
02:00:29,488 --> 02:00:31,251
But never more than tonight.

1399
02:00:31,724 --> 02:00:34,658
Not just 'cause we're meeting
to launch his wonderful new book

1400
02:00:34,726 --> 02:00:38,322
and he should be here to share
the joy of his life story with us,

1401
02:00:39,131 --> 02:00:43,090
but because he was so brilliant
at making speeches

1402
02:00:44,036 --> 02:00:45,502
and I'm so terrible.

1403
02:00:46,271 --> 02:00:48,206
"Langs are Scottish folk."

1404
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:50,771
"Wife and child, Langs are Scottish."

1405
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:53,301
"Wife, Langs. Lang's wife."

1406
02:00:54,646 --> 02:00:55,978
"Lang's

1407
02:00:57,350 --> 02:00:59,681
"wife Ruth

1408
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:03,113
"was recruited

1409
02:01:03,956 --> 02:01:10,190
"as a CIA agent

1410
02:01:11,197 --> 02:01:15,497
"by Professor Paul Emmett
of Harvard University."

1411
02:01:18,970 --> 02:01:21,632
Well, you'll be relieved to hear
I'm not making a speech this evening.

1412
02:01:21,707 --> 02:01:23,833
I just want to thank
our wonderful publishers,

1413
02:01:23,908 --> 02:01:26,469
Marty Rhinehart and John Maddox,

1414
02:01:26,545 --> 02:01:29,742
and our attorney and friend, Sidney Kroll.

1415
02:01:30,815 --> 02:01:36,618
And finally, but especially, Mike McAra.

1416
02:01:36,822 --> 02:01:39,346
Mike, our thoughts are with you.

1417
02:01:40,158 --> 02:01:44,960
In these very difficult few months,
I've drawn great comfort from this book,

1418
02:01:45,030 --> 02:01:49,865
from knowing that, despite the terrible
double tragedy of losing both of them,

1419
02:01:50,368 --> 02:01:54,203
Mike and Adam did at least live long
enough to complete it.

1420
02:01:55,041 --> 02:01:58,976
And I really believe that,
as people read these pages,

1421
02:01:59,045 --> 02:02:03,072
Adam's voice will keep on coming through
for generations to come,

1422
02:02:03,181 --> 02:02:05,775
eloquent, strong and full of hope.

1423
02:02:06,519 --> 02:02:10,046
Thanks to his words, he is with us still.

1424
02:02:11,524 --> 02:02:15,516
If I've left out anyone's name,
I hope you'll forgive me.

1425
02:02:18,898 --> 02:02:20,990
But now I must make a toast.

1426
02:02:21,466 --> 02:02:24,300
To the memory of a great man

1427
02:02:25,637 --> 02:02:28,105
and a great patriot,

1428
02:02:28,173 --> 02:02:30,938
a wonderful husband and a devoted father.

1429
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:31,998
To Adam!

1430
02:02:32,078 --> 02:02:33,545
To Adam!

1431
02:03:07,613 --> 02:03:09,341
You were marvelous.

1432
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:12,612
Would you...

1433
02:03:47,453 --> 02:03:48,818
This one looks nasty.

1434
02:03:48,887 --> 02:03:51,755
Yeah, it's just happened just now.
Yeah, if you could.
