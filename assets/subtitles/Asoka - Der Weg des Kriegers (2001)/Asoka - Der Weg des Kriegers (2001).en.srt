1
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,751
I won't talk to you.
You will also leave me.

2
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,758
Grandfather too is leaving.

3
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,331
When you grow wings,
you too will fly away.

4
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:37,128
Emperor Chandragupta Maurya
has embraced Jainism...

5
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:40,296
for which he is abdicating,
giving up his throne...

6
00:02:40,473 --> 00:02:43,340
his kingdom and his people.

7
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:56,545
Grandfather, Asoka has taken
your sword. He says it is his.

8
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:01,825
You are leaving me,
but the sword is mine.

9
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:06,727
Asoka, my son, this
is not just a sword.

10
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,425
It's a demon.

11
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:16,475
When drawn, it hungers blood.
It doesn't see friend or foe.

12
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:19,942
It sees only blood.Just blood.

13
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:26,747
Before it can do more harm,
let us get rid of it.

14
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:50,298
''This is not just a sword.
It's a demon.

15
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:57,171
It doesn't see friend or foe.
It sees only blood.Just blood.''

16
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:30,909
The Takshila army is mightier
than ours.

17
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:34,342
Half our army has not reached.

18
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:37,608
General Shivrath, hasn't reached...

19
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:40,810
or my brother Susima
has not let it reach?

20
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:45,583
We will not lose. For even if
wars are fought on battlefields...

21
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:48,352
they are won by the mind.

22
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:53,966
Takshila army, keep moving.

23
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:33,404
Prince, Takshila army is advancing.

24
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:39,307
Stop them, General,
by force or by deceit.

25
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:16,308
Their army has been halved.
Now they want to surrender.

26
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:22,712
The enemy deserves a chance.
Don't you agree, General?

27
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:32,196
Takshila's flags are down.
We want to surrender, Prince.

28
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:35,357
Our army has laid down their weapons.

29
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:40,939
Takshila kneels before Magadha.

30
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:52,674
Surrender to me.

31
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:56,749
The weapon is with me.

32
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:58,480
That is no weapon.

33
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:02,288
This is a weapon.

34
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:43,733
The head that won't bow to us
will be cut off.

35
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:56,242
What are you taking with you?

36
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,008
Nothing.

37
00:08:58,184 --> 00:09:00,709
All that and you say it's nothing?

38
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,252
Give us some of it.

39
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,425
Should i?

40
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:11,029
That's too much.

41
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:14,792
Want more?
-No, we'll share it.

42
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,799
You better smarten up.

43
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,236
Prince Asoka is arriving,
victorious from Takshila.

44
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,437
The stars never lie.
-Damn your stars.

45
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,277
Susima's mother is King Bindusara's
favored queen.

46
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:34,147
With her around no one will
dare eye the throne.

47
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,551
And what of Asoka's mother,
Queen Dharma?

48
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,487
She is less of a Queen
and more of a slave.

49
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,719
Only Prince Susima
can claim the throne.

50
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,783
Where is Susima?

51
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:52,427
General Shivrath.
The great General Shivrath.

52
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:55,829
It is you who suggested that
Asoka be sent to Takshila.

53
00:10:57,036 --> 00:11:01,097
You said he would lose, didn't you?

54
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,507
''Send him with half the army
and he won't return alive.''

55
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:08,547
You said so, right?

56
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:11,577
Then what is this?

57
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:20,548
What do we do with you now?
You have failed.

58
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:27,195
What is the fate of a defeated soldier?

59
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,767
Let me be sentenced to death.

60
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:36,967
Defeat hasn't crushed the warrior's
ego. He still holds his head high.

61
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:40,611
I want him to lower his head.

62
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:47,548
These arms and medals
belong to Magadha's proud army.

63
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,587
Do you think you deserve all this?

64
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:53,391
No.

65
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:59,023
Take them off.

66
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,361
Strip him naked.

67
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:17,743
Here, brother.
The General is now ready for war.

68
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:21,544
He has lowered his head.

69
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:25,185
Now you can kill him.

70
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:38,730
You don't know Asoka. i have tried
to kill him all of eleven times.

71
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:41,930
Don't worry.
Asoka will die for sure.

72
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:46,477
You know your job well.

73
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:50,082
i advise you to attack him while
he is bathing in the river...

74
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:52,979
when he is most vulnerable...

75
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:56,451
emerging out of the water, then...

76
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:12,157
All i want is to know who sent you.

77
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:48,195
Long live King Susima.

78
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:02,839
You missed. Again.

79
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,478
See, there isn't a scratch on me.

80
00:15:08,654 --> 00:15:11,384
i want you to leave Magadha.
-Why should i?

81
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:14,856
The coming siX moonless nights
are not auspicious for you.

82
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:17,427
My good or bad luck rests
with my sword.

83
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:20,623
Is that your wish? i run away?
i'm no coward.

84
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,667
i'm not afraid of anyone, Mother.
-But i'm afraid.

85
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:30,297
How can you know a mother's pain?
9 months i nurtured you in my womb.

86
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:33,445
i am your son, Mother.
i will understand your pain.

87
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:36,980
Even if i have to carry you around
for nine months.

88
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:41,176
Let me know your pain, Mother.

89
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,420
You are right, Mother.
Nine moments maybe...

90
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:52,860
but for nine months, you're too heavy.

91
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:55,125
Don't change the subject,
will you leave or not?

92
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:57,633
I heard you. I promise, Mother.

93
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:00,795
Asoka.
-I promise, Mother.

94
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:03,737
I promise, pundit-ji.

95
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:16,549
How are you?
We've not met since your return.

96
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:27,089
I heard that someone tried to kill you.

97
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:32,636
Someone did try to kill me, yet again.

98
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:37,138
Who would want that, Asoka?

99
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:40,939
A fool that misses each time.

100
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:46,847
Beware, Asoka.
One shouldn't underestimate the enemy.

101
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:51,251
He who faces me with a sword
is my enemy.

102
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:53,824
Not someone who lunges from behind.

103
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:58,896
Either way, the one who survives
ascends the throne.

104
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:02,228
No, Susima.
The throne belongs to the one...

105
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:05,529
who has the courage to sit on it.

106
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,807
That's a childhood trait of yours.
What I want, what I like...

107
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:16,141
is your desire too.

108
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:20,744
You even took Grandfather's sword.

109
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:24,351
Get off the throne, Asoka.

110
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,552
Make me do so, Sugatra.

111
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:42,096
Not like this, Sugatra.

112
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:47,838
If you must have the throne
then fight for it.

113
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:49,947
In front of everyone.

114
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:54,576
Meet me tomorrow morning
and I'll fight you, before everyone.

115
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:00,892
Tomorrow morning...

116
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:06,331
in front of everyone.

117
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:14,964
Sleep well, Asoka.
Tonight is your last night.

118
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:23,811
You are finished.

119
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:25,575
I will fight him.

120
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:28,845
Go ahead...fight him.

121
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:35,326
He dared to sit on the throne today.

122
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:37,496
Tomorrow, he may raise the sword
on me.

123
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:41,427
Your Majesty, it is my belief that
we analyze the situation...

124
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,094
Prime Minister, my belief is
that you stay silent.

125
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:50,675
It's you who has encouraged him.
-Why blame the Prime Minister?

126
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:53,936
Asoka is under Dharma's control.

127
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:58,049
Stop him, Dharma.
If something should happen tomorrow...

128
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:01,709
the blame will be entirely yours.

129
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:11,963
What's happening here?

130
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:15,497
Mother is taking a vow of silence.
-That will not happen here.

131
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:17,727
Everyone, leave.

132
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:28,606
What childishness is this?
A vow of silence, for life?

133
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:31,783
You won't talk to me ever again.

134
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:34,579
Why, Mother?

135
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:36,345
She won't speak to anyone.

136
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:41,949
Mother says why speak
when her own child turns a deaf ear?

137
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:52,667
Mother wants you to leave Magadha
and strive to live an ordinary life...

138
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:59,004
Give her your word that no one will
come to know you're Prince Asoka.

139
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:04,081
I must go? leave?

140
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,210
So that others can laugh at me
for running away scared?

141
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:17,023
You don't want your son to sit on the
throne? But I wanted it for you.

142
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:36,878
Here. I give in. Now speak to me.

143
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:40,678
Vitasoka, tell Mother to greet
an ordinary man.

144
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:45,449
Mother's like you, brother.
She won't speak till you leave.

145
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:49,025
All right, I'll go.

146
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:51,458
Even if you ask, I won't return.

147
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,032
Speak to me.

148
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:10,615
Brother won't be here.
He has gone, leaving Magadha.

149
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,243
Gone? So he's scared.

150
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:18,879
The brave Prince has fled
to save his life.

151
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,690
Idiot. Change your tune.

152
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:27,559
What's the matter with you?

153
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,360
Nothing.

154
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:33,232
Friends like us have nothing to hide.

155
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:39,942
Iast night, when I went home,
my wife was not there.

156
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:41,579
Where did she go?

157
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:44,740
When I asked her in the morning...

158
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:47,886
she said she was
with her friend, Kamini.

159
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,420
Silly. She must have been with Kamini.

160
00:21:50,622 --> 00:21:52,351
You idiot, I was with Kamini.

161
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:54,150
No, I was with Kamini.

162
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,759
I was there too.
You must have gone after me.

163
00:21:55,928 --> 00:22:01,457
Strange. My wife's name
is also Kamini.

164
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:03,794
That dark one?
-Yes.

165
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:18,076
Have you heard? Prince Asoka
has gone leaving Magadha.

166
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,811
He must have gotten scared
of Prince Susima.

167
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:23,784
When Jupiter enters
its twelfth position...

168
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:27,084
every great man must go into eXile.
-Really?

169
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:29,193
Iike Rama, Pandavas, Princes.

170
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:30,225
Strange.

171
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:56,921
You're not from here. Who are you?

172
00:22:57,122 --> 00:22:59,647
An ordinary traveler.

173
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:04,795
The sun remains the sun
even behind clouds.

174
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:08,660
Your destiny indicates
that you are in no way ordinary.

175
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:13,861
What lies in my destiny then?
That I am a prince?

176
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:17,464
One day I will be enthroned?
Be an emperor?

177
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:22,478
Even emperors are ordinary.
Your destiny transcends the throne.

178
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:27,210
Whose destiny can surpass
that of an emperor's?

179
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:33,781
A traveler's... when his journey
has been completed.

180
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:22,199
Eat, child. In Kalinga no one
goes to sleep hungry. You eat too.

181
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:33,542
Here, Pawan. It's good food.
Pawan, eat this. It's tasty.

182
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:40,056
Why should you eat? You too
miss Mother's hand feeding you.

183
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,094
No fuss. I'm an ordinary man.
You an ordinary horse.

184
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:47,663
No royal palace
or sumptuous dishes for us.

185
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:53,564
Now, it's the ground to sleep on...

186
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:56,401
the open sky above...

187
00:24:56,542 --> 00:25:00,103
and pretty princesses
who now eXist only in our dreams.

188
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:47,086
Go,you searching wind, go away

189
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:58,292
Go seek out my beloved

190
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:00,837
One good enough for me

191
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:10,037
It cannot be...

192
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,981
If there is...

193
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:25,762
Then maybe we can be together

194
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:36,635
Go... go...

195
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:22,650
The sky is a poet's page

196
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:26,484
And I its poem

197
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:29,991
Someone like me...

198
00:27:30,162 --> 00:27:33,928
Is rare in this world

199
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:35,828
Touch me not...

200
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:39,230
That's a dare...

201
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:51,409
It would start raging fire

202
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:01,953
Go... go...

203
00:29:04,656 --> 00:29:06,783
I didn't see a thing.

204
00:29:08,627 --> 00:29:11,289
I was just listening.

205
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:15,593
You swim...
I mean you sing very well.

206
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:17,257
What's your name?

207
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:24,808
I don't talk to strangers.
-Stranger?

208
00:29:27,078 --> 00:29:29,740
Do you not feel
that we have met before?

209
00:29:29,948 --> 00:29:33,816
In some other place, in another time...

210
00:29:33,985 --> 00:29:35,384
somewhere?

211
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,828
Who are you?

212
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:58,232
Pawan (the Wind). And you?

213
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:01,872
Why are you following me?

214
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:03,537
Your voice drew me.

215
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:09,012
I am warrior blood. You risk death.

216
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:14,157
I am dead.

217
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,060
My warrior.

218
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,249
Pawan, this place is unfit for a horse
like you. Wait here.

219
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:42,375
Iook, another one in search
of the same thing.

220
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:45,979
You won't find...
Nobody will.

221
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:48,523
Who?
-Not who, 'What'.

222
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:53,460
1 00 shining, clinking gold coins.

223
00:30:53,632 --> 00:30:59,093
Reward for finding Prince Arya
and Princess Kaurwaki.

224
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,677
You're very pretty.

225
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:15,444
And you're the prettiest, Meghna.

226
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,818
Meghna? My name's Urvashi.
-Doesn't matter, you're all pretty.

227
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:24,257
Who is there? Will someone dare
to take up my challenge?

228
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:31,063
Friend, you seem new here.
How about you?

229
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:34,963
Come, show us your mettle.

230
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,131
Go...go.

231
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:44,976
Brave youngsters these days
parade around with twigs.

232
00:31:46,017 --> 00:31:50,477
Give it back.
-Sit. Win it back.

233
00:31:57,095 --> 00:32:00,929
What's your name?
-Pawan (the Wind).

234
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:03,033
A horse's name.

235
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:08,038
His father must be 'Badal' ( cloud).

236
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,177
Iook behind...
There's no one.

237
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:20,182
You won by cheating.
-Either way, I won.

238
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:22,650
You must fight me again.
-Iet go.

239
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:25,051
I will not.

240
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:27,315
No way out.
You'll have to fight.

241
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:30,824
Where were you last night?
I've been waiting for ages.

242
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:35,693
Who are all these people?
Come home now, I'll show you.

243
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:38,735
You are the first to defeat Virat.

244
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:41,303
Come with me.

245
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:44,738
You've not been drinking, have you?
-No.

246
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:50,472
You take over the bullock cart.
It's dangerous to drink and ride.

247
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,380
He's right, let's go.

248
00:32:58,223 --> 00:33:02,819
Woke up, finally? Will you just
sit around? Or will you work?

249
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:08,523
What work?
-You must work if you want to stay.

250
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,033
If not, you should leave.

251
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:16,037
I can do any kind of work.

252
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:25,445
This work I cannot do.

253
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:32,088
Greetings. I'm new to this.
You could face some discomfort.

254
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:37,250
Even so, please don't move.
And please don't kick.

255
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:47,235
Your eyes too are beautiful.

256
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:50,831
You? Why are you following me?

257
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:52,839
I am following you?

258
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:57,071
Yesterday I was in the forest and
you emerged from the waterfalls.

259
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,979
Now you're here on the preteXt
of getting milk.

260
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:04,588
And what were you doing in my dream
last night?

261
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:08,248
At least tell me your name.

262
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,428
Give me the milk.
-Iook, over there.

263
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,168
Hey, Warrior.

264
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,876
Stop. Princess Kaurwaki.

265
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:39,089
Yes, we found her.
The 1 00 gold coins are ours.

266
00:34:40,825 --> 00:34:43,419
1 00 gold coins for her?

267
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:46,995
Back off. She is ours.
-Know how to swim?

268
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:48,689
Yes, of course.

269
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:53,660
And you?
That's good.

270
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:03,410
Iets go.

271
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:09,215
You crazy? lf you can't swim then
why jump into the water?

272
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:24,197
What's wrong? Seems all of Kalinga
is after you...

273
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:26,633
Princess Kaurwaki.

274
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:33,540
You're among them. For you,
all I mean is 1 00 gold coins.

275
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:35,941
I couldn't put a price on you.

276
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:39,049
The earth doesn't have
enough gold for that.

277
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:47,492
Stay with Arya. He is alone.
Stop. Who sent you?

278
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:55,464
Drink up.

279
00:35:56,601 --> 00:36:00,093
When I'm king,
there will be food for all.

280
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,404
Don't tell anyone.

281
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:14,351
Who is this? ls he dead?
-It's just an injury. Go back inside.

282
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:18,478
How did he get hurt?
-Bheema hit him. Go inside.

283
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,056
Did he come to kill me?

284
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:27,462
Arya, go inside.

285
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:31,966
Why did you bring him here?
You know it's dangerous.

286
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:35,628
Why did you hit him?
-Arya, go inside.

287
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:40,244
First tell me, why you hit him.
-Arya, go inside.

288
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:45,515
Why did you bring him here?

289
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:49,813
He could be anyone,
a murderer, an assassin...

290
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:53,388
He saved my life, Bheema.
-Don't you know why?

291
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:57,755
He's after the same thing:
1 00 gold coins.

292
00:36:57,929 --> 00:37:02,730
You may take your life lightly
but Arya is my responsibility.

293
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:06,267
Arya is my brother, General.
-Iet's go then.

294
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:09,929
I can't leave him in this condition.
-You'll have to.

295
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:15,603
We are leaving from here.
-General, are you ordering me?

296
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,444
No. I'm just trying
to make you understand.

297
00:37:20,618 --> 00:37:22,609
The rest is up to you.

298
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:34,022
Forgive me, Prince.
Please have your meal now.

299
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:36,826
Here, I'm Prince?
lnside you scold me?

300
00:37:37,035 --> 00:37:40,596
Scold me then after eating.
-I don't wish to eat.

301
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:44,299
I want to go home
-Yes, Prince. We leave tomorrow.

302
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:48,536
Not tomorrow, today.
-I said tomorrow.

303
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:51,045
It's always tomorrow.

304
00:37:51,215 --> 00:37:54,343
When I am king everything
will be settled today.

305
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,487
No tomorrows.

306
00:38:07,265 --> 00:38:08,823
Kaurwaki...

307
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:30,847
Kaurwaki, give it to me.

308
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:34,852
Mother, look at Kaurwaki.

309
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:46,266
Mother.

310
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:52,231
It's all right.
It was only a nightmare.

311
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:55,277
I want to go home.
-Yes. We will go.

312
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,752
Where is Prince Arya?

313
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:09,619
I assure the senate that
Prince Arya will soon be with us...

314
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:13,695
to take the royal place
of his late father.

315
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:18,734
I have announced a 1 00 gold coin
reward to anyone who finds him.

316
00:39:18,903 --> 00:39:22,771
It's not just a matter
of finding Prince Arya.

317
00:39:22,974 --> 00:39:25,875
The King's assassins roam free.

318
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:28,342
What's happening in Kalinga?
Answer me.

319
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:31,380
There is a conspiracy brewing
in Kalinga.

320
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:35,815
The person involved is here
in this senate amongst us.

321
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:38,114
Who is he?
-You.

322
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:41,314
Or you. It may even be you.
-Me?

323
00:39:41,526 --> 00:39:43,460
It could be anyone.

324
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:48,459
Suspecting each other is futile.

325
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:52,967
It's your responsibility to find
the culprit, Prime Minister.

326
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:55,264
We trust you.

327
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:13,255
Kaurwaki...

328
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:31,974
Kaurwaki...

329
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:37,837
Now Kaurwaki? last night
another name was on your lips.

330
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:39,607
Is that so?

331
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:42,309
And what were you doing
so close to me last night?

332
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:47,454
Don't go. It still hurts...

333
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:51,084
If you leave, the pain will get worse.

334
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:57,267
My Warrior, listen.
-I don't want to hear.

335
00:40:57,435 --> 00:41:01,428
But I want to say it.
-Fine. Say it.

336
00:41:01,606 --> 00:41:05,133
Can I come close and say it?
-What are you doing?

337
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:08,574
Nothing?
-I saw him trying to tell you something.

338
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:13,240
He was telling me a story.
-I want to hear it too.

339
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:16,545
But I don't know any stories.
-I order you. Tell me a story.

340
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:21,249
Prince, don't get angry.
I will tell you a story.

341
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:23,017
Once, there was a prince.
-Iike me?

342
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:27,789
A little older. He left his kingdom
and roamed the jungle.

343
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:32,527
Iike us? Then what?
-One day he heard something...

344
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:36,764
Someone was singing.
The voice drew him to a waterfall.

345
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:39,774
He saw a princess, bathing...

346
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:42,537
Her lovely body, head to toe,
glistening with water drops.

347
00:41:42,713 --> 00:41:45,238
And the prince fell in love.

348
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:47,646
At first sight.
-I knew it. Then?

349
00:41:47,818 --> 00:41:51,948
Said the prince to the princess,
''You sing beautifully!''

350
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:53,817
The princess got angry,
picked up her sword.

351
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:56,983
Why? The prince didn't do anything.

352
00:41:57,195 --> 00:42:02,189
He watched her bathe, you see.
-So? I too bathe in the open.

353
00:42:02,366 --> 00:42:06,063
You're different.
The Princess had no clothes on her.

354
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:12,005
Arya, supper's ready. Come eat.
-But I want to hear the story.

355
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:14,667
First eat. Then the story.

356
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,647
How are you now?
-I'm fine.

357
00:42:18,816 --> 00:42:21,785
I must find the rascal
who hit me from behind.

358
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:25,218
This rascal. He hits everybody.

359
00:42:25,423 --> 00:42:29,655
We should leave now.
- By the way, where are you headed?

360
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:31,761
Kalinga.

361
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:33,760
That's where I am going too.

362
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:38,334
We won't trouble you. Iet's go.

363
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:47,734
Tell me the story.

364
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:52,481
Rascal.

365
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:58,815
What is this?

366
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:02,492
Ieft your work without warning?

367
00:43:02,693 --> 00:43:07,460
Work when you please. Ieave
when you please. This won't do.

368
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:13,663
She went away.
She didn't even look back.

369
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:15,305
Is it done?

370
00:43:54,745 --> 00:44:00,206
Come, get ready.
Come, get ready.

371
00:44:01,218 --> 00:44:04,710
Iet's catch the evening boat.
Iet's get on it. Come, let's go.

372
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:07,517
There will be an anchor, somewhere...

373
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:12,254
Somewhere there's a shore...
Iet's go. Iet's go.

374
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:22,799
Prepare yourself, then let's leave

375
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:28,502
Whether we swim or we sink...
We have to get across

376
00:45:08,853 --> 00:45:11,287
The evening will be so pleasant

377
00:45:11,455 --> 00:45:13,787
The words will be mine.
But the thought yours

378
00:45:14,024 --> 00:45:19,291
The talk will be innocent...
sweet, diluted with honey

379
00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:28,427
What is this surge of love?
Do I drown to eXperience it?

380
00:46:28,566 --> 00:46:32,764
Can't you tell what it is?
Where could it lead?

381
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:36,906
The heart will burn,
the eyes will fill

382
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:39,735
You fight very well.

383
00:47:42,873 --> 00:47:45,034
Here, straighten this.

384
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:56,514
I'll be leaving too.
-Wait.

385
00:47:56,687 --> 00:48:00,623
The fight is not over.
-I warn you.

386
00:48:00,824 --> 00:48:03,486
I have learnt the art of battle
from the great teXts.

387
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:06,457
I know 1 8 tactics of fighting.

388
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,292
I do too.

389
00:48:09,466 --> 00:48:13,232
All 1 8?
-All 1 8 of them. Come, fight.

390
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:19,106
Tell me, friend.
Do you know the 1 9th tactic?

391
00:48:19,276 --> 00:48:21,870
Which is this 1 9th tactic?

392
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:23,809
The 1 9th tactic?

393
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:29,442
In the 1 9th tactic the warrior
fights his foe blindfolded.

394
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:31,487
Iike this.

395
00:48:31,655 --> 00:48:33,316
Pawan, Pawan.

396
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:35,048
Quiet, everyone.

397
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:39,628
What's new in that?
Even I know this tactic.

398
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:41,697
Prepare yourself.

399
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,995
Have you got the blindfold on?
-Yes.

400
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:48,263
You can't see anything?
-Not a thing.

401
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:51,706
You hit first.

402
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:55,043
Try again.

403
00:48:56,013 --> 00:48:57,412
Keep at it.

404
00:48:58,515 --> 00:49:02,576
Friend, remember... the '1 9th' tactic.

405
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:07,654
Quiet.

406
00:49:10,461 --> 00:49:12,395
Will he be back?

407
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:16,359
Who, Pawan?

408
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:19,058
Yes, Pawan. I want to hear the story.

409
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:21,830
Here you go, prince. Eat some fruit.

410
00:49:22,006 --> 00:49:24,668
Bheema, know any stories?

411
00:49:24,842 --> 00:49:27,242
No.

412
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:29,606
No for everything.

413
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:47,028
Tell us, who are you?
What are you doing here?

414
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:51,031
Princess, hide.

415
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:02,109
Were you looking for me?

416
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:05,248
When you left you did not look back
even once.

417
00:50:41,385 --> 00:50:43,285
Take care of Arya.

418
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:00,897
Don't leave them, Bheema.

419
00:51:03,574 --> 00:51:05,633
He will kill everyone.

420
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,594
Well, what's this?
The sun pendant.

421
00:51:25,729 --> 00:51:28,061
It is our Prince Arya, isn't it?

422
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:32,867
Iook, our Prince got scared.

423
00:51:34,037 --> 00:51:37,666
Don't be afraid, Prince.
We won't do anything to hurt you.

424
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:29,851
You fight well.
Where did you learn?

425
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,853
I'm a soldier in the Magadha army.

426
00:53:35,192 --> 00:53:37,217
You, soldier of Magadha army?

427
00:53:37,427 --> 00:53:42,330
And I'm the General of Kalinga.
That makes us enemies.

428
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:44,832
Enemies.

429
00:53:47,905 --> 00:53:51,568
How long?
How much longer will it take?

430
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:55,575
Do I have to wait for eternity
to ascend the throne?

431
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:59,408
Find Prince Arya and kill him.

432
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:03,610
As proof, hand me the sun pendant
he wears around his neck.

433
00:54:03,754 --> 00:54:05,119
Go.

434
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:30,211
Why a sword in such beautiful hands?

435
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,281
I want to be as skilled as you
in wielding the sword.

436
00:54:34,584 --> 00:54:38,953
To fight the evil ones.
-Who are they?

437
00:54:39,156 --> 00:54:41,249
The ones who killed my parents.

438
00:54:42,326 --> 00:54:46,228
I'm with you, Kaurwaki.
I will always be close to you.

439
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:49,697
I don't want to depend on others.

440
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:54,501
Then, hold the sword like this.

441
00:55:00,911 --> 00:55:06,850
Iet it be a part of your body.
Iet it connect to your soul.

442
00:55:09,987 --> 00:55:14,583
No fear, no hesitation...
No sense of life or death.

443
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:16,452
Focus only on your target.

444
00:55:50,827 --> 00:55:52,522
Not like this.

445
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:58,092
Eye to eye...

446
00:55:59,503 --> 00:56:02,233
Never shift your eyes
from your enemy.

447
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:31,458
I just touched my warrior
and she took offense.

448
00:56:31,635 --> 00:56:34,331
Just imagine, she pushed me.

449
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:37,940
You men. You could not have said
or heard anything.

450
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:41,043
Probably grabbed the girl's hand.
-I did. So?

451
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:46,342
You need to be gentle with girls.
Some love, some flowers...

452
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:47,881
say some words of love.

453
00:56:48,051 --> 00:56:51,919
Say what? love speaks for itself.

454
00:56:52,055 --> 00:56:55,491
Are you afraid of eXpressing love?
-I'm not afraid of anything.

455
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:59,128
Nonsense. Tell me, how does one
go about this love talk?

456
00:56:59,329 --> 00:57:02,890
Here. Hold these flowers. Take it all.

457
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:08,470
Go tell her...
I love you...you alone.

458
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:12,734
I can't think of anything but you.

459
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:16,310
After meeting you
my world has changed.

460
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,072
I have changed.

461
00:57:18,248 --> 00:57:21,479
I can't understand anything.
If I keep silent, I'll go mad.

462
00:57:21,651 --> 00:57:23,448
All that? I can't do it.

463
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,851
Hold this? You have to say it.

464
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:30,321
I'm ln love with you
-Right.

465
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:31,926
Only you.
-Perfect.

466
00:57:32,095 --> 00:57:34,893
Keep at it and
I'll get some more flowers.

467
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:39,094
Ever since I have met you,
everything's changed.

468
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:42,261
I have changed,
you seem changed.

469
00:57:43,507 --> 00:57:47,773
I can't think of anything
or anyone else but you...

470
00:57:47,944 --> 00:57:49,343
You.

471
00:57:49,946 --> 00:57:52,915
Your love story brings tears
to my eyes.

472
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,607
Now your tears will flow.

473
00:57:54,818 --> 00:57:58,151
My friend, not today.
Somebody is waiting.

474
00:57:58,321 --> 00:58:00,255
They'll have to wait a lifetime.

475
00:58:00,423 --> 00:58:02,789
Virat, my friend...
-Nothing will work today.

476
00:58:02,993 --> 00:58:07,396
No blindfold, no 1 9th tactic.
Today nothing will work.

477
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:10,122
What if I say
there's someone behind you?

478
00:58:10,267 --> 00:58:12,428
I won't look back.

479
00:58:12,602 --> 00:58:15,833
There's someone behind you.
-I know there's no one.

480
00:58:16,006 --> 00:58:17,473
Virat, somebody is there.

481
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:21,077
You're cheating again.
Telling me lies?

482
00:58:24,548 --> 00:58:27,278
I'm leaving, my friend.

483
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:30,715
So? You promised you'll be
with me forever.

484
00:58:30,887 --> 00:58:33,412
After that day, I see you today.

485
00:58:34,524 --> 00:58:39,257
I won't speak to him ever,
didn't even tell me before he left.

486
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:43,096
Are you crying?

487
00:58:44,234 --> 00:58:48,136
First, you fight with Pawan.
Then you sit here and cry?

488
00:58:48,305 --> 00:58:50,364
Why should I cry?

489
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:54,408
What have I to do with him?
-Iook, Pawan's horse.

490
00:59:16,766 --> 00:59:18,495
You glass doll...

491
00:59:33,817 --> 00:59:36,911
Sealed in your lips
is the lilt of love

492
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,816
But you won't speak

493
00:59:38,989 --> 00:59:40,513
Or utter it

494
00:59:40,724 --> 00:59:42,385
It lingers on your eyelashes

495
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:45,094
And lurks on lowered eyes

496
00:59:58,341 --> 00:59:59,933
Come, listen.

497
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:02,704
Sweeter than sugar

498
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:05,370
are your veiled eyelids

499
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:08,915
You don't open your eyes

500
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:12,316
or reveal what they say

501
01:00:50,293 --> 01:00:53,660
If you wish to cross the hills
I'll move mountains for you

502
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:57,231
If you seek shelter in the clouds
I'll ward off the monsoon rains

503
01:00:57,434 --> 01:01:03,737
A bird in the sky will guide
you to the hill where the sun rises

504
01:01:57,927 --> 01:02:04,457
Please introduce yourself, beautiful
Your smile is sweetness

505
01:02:04,634 --> 01:02:08,070
You are a foreigner, will forget
me easily. Give me your promise

506
01:02:08,204 --> 01:02:11,731
So I can wear it like a jewel

507
01:03:16,005 --> 01:03:18,940
The prime minister of Magadha
has sent a message.

508
01:03:20,777 --> 01:03:22,608
Please continue with the story.

509
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:24,474
The story... where were we?

510
01:03:24,647 --> 01:03:26,945
The Princess's clothes...

511
01:03:27,116 --> 01:03:31,416
She wore them, walked away,
and the prince followed her

512
01:03:31,588 --> 01:03:32,919
Why?

513
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:35,148
Iovely princess,
alone in a dark forest...

514
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:38,350
What of wild animals?

515
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:42,361
Any wild animal seeing a
lovely princess would follow.

516
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:45,434
Then what happened?

517
01:03:45,602 --> 01:03:47,763
The princess turned around
and said, ''l am a princess...

518
01:03:47,937 --> 01:03:50,872
If you follow me you
will get a tight slap''.

519
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,008
The prince left then?

520
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:57,202
No, he was shameless.

521
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:01,180
Is this your story or mine?
You tell it then.

522
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:03,615
No, you tell it.

523
01:04:03,786 --> 01:04:07,017
Why would our prince who braved
death bother over a slap?

524
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:12,560
He kept following the princess.
Suddenly, three monsters appeared.

525
01:04:14,998 --> 01:04:17,023
Where was the prince from?

526
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,500
The prince had no kingdom.
It was stolen from him.

527
01:04:21,704 --> 01:04:23,501
Just like us.

528
01:04:23,673 --> 01:04:26,938
Someone stole our land as well.

529
01:04:29,445 --> 01:04:31,936
Someone stole our Kalinga.

530
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:35,141
So what?

531
01:04:37,186 --> 01:04:43,147
The sun is yours, the moon too.
All the stars up there are yours.

532
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:46,260
No one can take that away from you.

533
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:47,794
Really?
-Yes.

534
01:04:47,964 --> 01:04:51,695
What's more, no man can
take your land away from you.

535
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:57,363
I'm there with you.
I'll get your land back for you.

536
01:05:10,153 --> 01:05:12,280
Hey, warrior.

537
01:05:12,455 --> 01:05:16,221
I ... Iisten to me.

538
01:05:16,426 --> 01:05:20,385
I have not told anyone this before.
Kaurwaki...listen.

539
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:23,758
Please listen.

540
01:05:26,402 --> 01:05:28,529
Tell me.

541
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:33,668
Kaurwaki, I love you, only you.

542
01:05:33,843 --> 01:05:36,744
I can't think of anything
or anyone but you.

543
01:05:37,981 --> 01:05:40,415
Ever since I have met
you everything has changed.

544
01:05:40,617 --> 01:05:42,209
I have changed.

545
01:05:42,385 --> 01:05:43,909
I don't know what to do.

546
01:05:44,087 --> 01:05:47,352
If I didn't tell you,
I would lose my mind.

547
01:06:02,071 --> 01:06:07,099
I love you, only you.

548
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:14,309
I can't think of anything
or anyone else but you.

549
01:06:15,485 --> 01:06:20,923
Ever since I have met you
everything has changed.

550
01:06:22,525 --> 01:06:24,993
I have changed.

551
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:27,128
I'm glad you told me.

552
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:30,959
If you didn't,
I would lose my mind.

553
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:34,166
That's eXactly what I said.

554
01:06:36,139 --> 01:06:38,130
But you should say it like this.

555
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,415
Where were you?

556
01:06:52,588 --> 01:06:54,385
With Pawan.

557
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,114
What were you doing?

558
01:06:57,226 --> 01:07:01,424
Is this the way to behave?
That too with an ordinary soldier?

559
01:07:01,597 --> 01:07:06,057
Bheema, don't forget who
it is you are talking to.

560
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:09,830
That's why I am speaking out.

561
01:07:10,006 --> 01:07:12,031
It is not right for you
to associate with Pawan.

562
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:17,373
Careful, Bheema. I love Pawan.

563
01:07:17,547 --> 01:07:19,708
You love Pawan?

564
01:07:19,882 --> 01:07:23,340
Who is Pawan?
Where does he come from?

565
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:28,957
He says four nice words
to you and you think it's love?

566
01:07:29,092 --> 01:07:33,119
How do you see it?
You think I don't know what love is?

567
01:07:35,164 --> 01:07:36,563
You don't.

568
01:07:38,735 --> 01:07:42,762
You don't know the difference
between love and a commoner's lust.

569
01:07:45,742 --> 01:07:47,767
Don't forget
that you are just a General...

570
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:49,468
and I'm a princess.

571
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:52,273
You are my servant.
A slave to my royal family.

572
01:07:52,448 --> 01:07:56,407
Yes, I'm a servant.
But who are you?

573
01:07:56,619 --> 01:08:02,080
You think you are a princess?
The family you are so proud of...

574
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:08,493
What did you say?

575
01:08:08,698 --> 01:08:11,724
What about my family?
Tell me, Bheema.

576
01:08:11,901 --> 01:08:16,736
You were found by a fisherman.
Your origin is unknown.

577
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:19,101
No one knows your lineage...

578
01:08:26,282 --> 01:08:28,341
The king adopted you.

579
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,517
Who am I then?

580
01:08:38,194 --> 01:08:39,593
Nobody knows.

581
01:09:12,328 --> 01:09:16,560
My warrior, why are you here alone?

582
01:09:21,204 --> 01:09:23,968
I know what you are thinking.

583
01:09:27,343 --> 01:09:30,403
Me, a princess. He, a mere soldier.

584
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:33,981
Arriving with his heart,
horse and sword.

585
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:42,783
Warrior. What happened?
What's wrong?

586
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:48,594
I am no warrior, Pawan.

587
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:53,593
Those who I thought
were my parents...

588
01:09:57,306 --> 01:09:59,206
I am not of their blood.

589
01:09:59,342 --> 01:10:03,802
They found me, Pawan.
They raised me as an orphan.

590
01:10:06,449 --> 01:10:10,818
I have no identity, Pawan.

591
01:10:16,525 --> 01:10:19,187
What difference is there...

592
01:10:19,362 --> 01:10:25,858
between the blood of a warrior
and that of an ordinary man?

593
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:32,740
Nothing's changed. I love you.

594
01:10:32,909 --> 01:10:35,173
Who do you love? Who am l?

595
01:10:36,212 --> 01:10:40,649
You are my warrior, my princess.

596
01:10:47,223 --> 01:10:48,656
Come with me.

597
01:11:22,325 --> 01:11:24,793
Iook. Iook at the flame.

598
01:11:56,192 --> 01:11:58,660
Are you going to push me away again?

599
01:12:03,165 --> 01:12:08,569
Not so quick.
Tell me, what's my wedding gift?

600
01:12:08,771 --> 01:12:12,002
I've given you my heart. What more?

601
01:12:12,174 --> 01:12:13,573
Your horse.

602
01:12:15,878 --> 01:12:17,277
He's yours.

603
01:12:18,948 --> 01:12:22,543
Your sword.
-That too.

604
01:12:23,686 --> 01:12:25,119
Your clothes.

605
01:12:26,589 --> 01:12:30,787
Not in front of the horse.

606
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,454
What are you doing?
My Warrior...no...no...

607
01:12:57,019 --> 01:12:58,646
I'll be right back.

608
01:13:07,997 --> 01:13:09,897
Stand upright, don't bow.

609
01:13:10,066 --> 01:13:11,693
Greetings, Prince Asoka.

610
01:13:11,867 --> 01:13:13,357
Embrace me.

611
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:18,231
Why are you here?

612
01:13:18,407 --> 01:13:20,602
Your mother wants to meet you.

613
01:13:22,645 --> 01:13:25,045
Tell Mother I will not return.

614
01:13:25,181 --> 01:13:28,207
She is very ill.

615
01:13:36,559 --> 01:13:38,026
You may go.

616
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:56,270
What's the matter?

617
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,048
Mother's unwell.

618
01:14:08,023 --> 01:14:10,218
You should go to her then.

619
01:14:15,097 --> 01:14:16,496
What about you and Arya?

620
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:20,123
We'll be fine.
We'll stay here till you get back.

621
01:14:20,302 --> 01:14:21,701
Please go.

622
01:14:28,144 --> 01:14:31,807
You're leaving again?
I won't let you go.

623
01:14:33,616 --> 01:14:38,952
Prince Arya, a matter of two days.
I'll return soon.

624
01:14:39,155 --> 01:14:45,617
You did not even finish the story.
-Where were we?

625
01:14:47,096 --> 01:14:49,257
Yes... the three monsters died.

626
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,793
The prince killed them all.

627
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:58,135
The Princess's anger turned to love.

628
01:14:58,307 --> 01:15:01,743
The prince asked for
her hand in marriage.

629
01:15:01,911 --> 01:15:03,310
She said yes, right?

630
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:04,810
Instantly.

631
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,379
Then?

632
01:15:08,484 --> 01:15:09,951
Then the prince left.

633
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:11,643
Where to?

634
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:15,984
To his mother who was ill.

635
01:15:17,293 --> 01:15:19,659
This is a sad story.

636
01:15:19,828 --> 01:15:26,631
No way. The prince will return with
hundreds of horses and elephants...

637
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,804
...to take his princess away.

638
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:36,605
Tell the prince to return soon.
His princess will be waiting.

639
01:15:38,747 --> 01:15:43,446
The prince will come back
with hundreds of horses and elephants.

640
01:15:47,156 --> 01:15:49,215
You take care of Kaurwaki.

641
01:16:38,974 --> 01:16:40,464
Greetings, Prince.

642
01:16:40,643 --> 01:16:43,043
Where is Mother?
-Come inside.

643
01:16:50,619 --> 01:16:52,780
You lie to me and then want
God's forgiveness?

644
01:16:52,988 --> 01:16:56,151
Had I not lied how would I see my son?

645
01:16:56,358 --> 01:16:59,486
Seen me? Now I must leave.
Someone is waiting for me.

646
01:16:59,628 --> 01:17:01,289
Who?

647
01:17:01,463 --> 01:17:02,862
Someone.

648
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:07,825
As lovely as a lotus,
a heavenly creature.

649
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:12,269
She is so beautiful.
Anyone who sees her...

650
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:14,409
Will become a poet?

651
01:17:14,576 --> 01:17:16,305
No... a lover.

652
01:17:16,478 --> 01:17:18,912
You forget the white hair.

653
01:17:19,081 --> 01:17:20,605
White hair?

654
01:17:23,252 --> 01:17:29,122
She is someone else but
you'll always be my first love.

655
01:17:29,291 --> 01:17:32,590
Mere words. Who is she?

656
01:17:32,795 --> 01:17:36,891
Kaurwaki.
-Kaurwaki? What of her family?

657
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:43,369
All here. You, Vitasoka, me.
We are her family.

658
01:17:44,473 --> 01:17:47,874
Mother, I have married her.
-Married?

659
01:17:48,043 --> 01:17:50,307
Why didn't you bring her?
-Not like this.

660
01:17:50,446 --> 01:17:52,573
When I do, Magadha will welcome her
ceremoniously.

661
01:17:52,748 --> 01:17:57,515
The streets will be lit with lamps,
decorated with flowers.

662
01:17:57,686 --> 01:18:01,520
Then I will tell her who I am.
-You've not told her yet?

663
01:18:01,724 --> 01:18:07,162
I told a lovely white-haired lady
that I won't tell anyone.

664
01:18:07,363 --> 01:18:08,728
Silly.

665
01:18:09,798 --> 01:18:12,392
Take the blessings of the King.

666
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:18,904
Praise the lord.

667
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:25,946
General, the rumor all over Kalinga
is that Prince Arya has been killed.

668
01:18:26,115 --> 01:18:30,711
The senate has decided to place
someone else on the throne.

669
01:18:30,886 --> 01:18:34,344
I know that's why it's important
that I go to Kalinga.

670
01:18:34,556 --> 01:18:37,855
It's unsafe for Arya to go there now.

671
01:18:38,961 --> 01:18:42,226
Princess, give me your anklet...

672
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:47,626
Arya, your necklace.

673
01:18:49,004 --> 01:18:51,199
No one should know
they are hiding here.

674
01:18:51,373 --> 01:18:56,242
Don't worry, General.
I will guard them with my life.

675
01:18:57,312 --> 01:19:02,272
He's served the royal family for years.
You'll be safe here.

676
01:19:02,418 --> 01:19:04,886
Don't go anywhere until my return.

677
01:19:05,087 --> 01:19:09,547
Yes... now I have to listen
to the General's orders.

678
01:19:13,095 --> 01:19:14,585
Greetings, Susima.

679
01:19:19,802 --> 01:19:21,201
Greetings.

680
01:19:24,072 --> 01:19:26,063
Where were you all these days?

681
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:29,267
Just wandering around.

682
01:19:29,445 --> 01:19:32,209
Tomorrow morning,
in front of everyone.

683
01:19:32,381 --> 01:19:36,715
I was just scaring you.
I don't want to fight.

684
01:19:36,852 --> 01:19:40,049
Susima, I don't want
the throne or the crown.

685
01:19:40,255 --> 01:19:41,813
I don't want anything.

686
01:19:44,426 --> 01:19:47,395
Have you ever loved someone?

687
01:19:47,596 --> 01:19:51,464
Iove?
-No? You should.

688
01:20:07,282 --> 01:20:10,149
Brother, he is trying to trick us again.

689
01:20:11,386 --> 01:20:15,846
So, you've returned?
You remembered Magadha?

690
01:20:18,393 --> 01:20:21,453
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I wanted to...

691
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:27,859
A rebellion is threatened in Ujjaini.
Go there.

692
01:20:30,472 --> 01:20:32,064
Any problem?

693
01:20:35,644 --> 01:20:37,475
No, Your Majesty.

694
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:56,922
Are you missing Pawan?
-Yes.

695
01:20:57,099 --> 01:21:02,036
He said that should I think of him
I should call his name out loud.

696
01:21:02,204 --> 01:21:03,535
Then, he'll appear.

697
01:21:03,705 --> 01:21:04,831
Should I call him?

698
01:21:09,378 --> 01:21:11,846
You call out as well.

699
01:21:20,989 --> 01:21:22,456
Prince...

700
01:21:33,135 --> 01:21:35,729
I must go.
-His highness has ordered...

701
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:41,468
Don't worry. You go to Ujjaini.
I will meet you there.

702
01:21:52,487 --> 01:21:57,515
Despite the talk,
I was sure you were all safe.

703
01:21:57,726 --> 01:21:59,626
Who would want to kill Prince Arya?

704
01:21:59,828 --> 01:22:01,853
At first I suspected you.

705
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:04,055
And I suspected you.

706
01:22:04,232 --> 01:22:08,601
At times like this friends
suspect one another.

707
01:22:08,737 --> 01:22:13,470
Bring Prince Arya here at the earliest.
I cannot contain the senate any longer.

708
01:22:13,642 --> 01:22:15,075
You are right.

709
01:22:15,243 --> 01:22:16,870
Don't go alone, General.

710
01:22:17,045 --> 01:22:23,450
I need no one.
-You do.

711
01:22:23,585 --> 01:22:26,053
The enemy is very cunning.

712
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:35,049
Where are Prince Arya
and Princess Kaurwaki?

713
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:48,530
Burn this village, burn everything...

714
01:23:48,704 --> 01:23:51,195
either they'll come out or burn alive.

715
01:23:51,339 --> 01:23:55,503
Where are Prince Arya
and Princess Kaurwaki?

716
01:24:11,126 --> 01:24:13,890
No. Stop.

717
01:24:14,963 --> 01:24:16,863
Stop, we are here.

718
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:21,061
Please let them be, I beg you.

719
01:24:38,186 --> 01:24:40,086
Kaurwaki.

720
01:25:00,542 --> 01:25:04,808
Good that I found you.
That woman, she said...

721
01:25:07,582 --> 01:25:09,846
Where are Kaurwaki and Arya?

722
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:13,746
Bheema?

723
01:25:13,955 --> 01:25:15,650
Where is Kaurwaki?

724
01:25:20,529 --> 01:25:22,997
What happened, Bheema?

725
01:25:23,165 --> 01:25:24,655
Where is Kaurwaki?

726
01:25:28,837 --> 01:25:33,672
Bheema, where is Kaurwaki?

727
01:25:35,944 --> 01:25:39,880
Bheema...l ask you,
Where is Kaurwaki?

728
01:27:56,051 --> 01:27:58,679
Here's your 20th tactic.

729
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:18,497
What about the 1 9th one?

730
01:28:19,574 --> 01:28:26,878
Speak up, friend. Your turn now.
No running off today? You've lost?

731
01:28:27,048 --> 01:28:29,448
Get up.

732
01:28:31,353 --> 01:28:34,288
You're not even worth a thrashing.

733
01:28:41,496 --> 01:28:45,091
What's this? lost your mind?

734
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:49,625
Iet go of my hand. Iet go.

735
01:28:49,838 --> 01:28:52,102
Who are you people?

736
01:28:52,273 --> 01:28:53,900
Iet me go.

737
01:29:00,915 --> 01:29:02,314
Wait.

738
01:29:12,861 --> 01:29:15,659
But Prince Asoka, he tried to...
-Spare him.

739
01:29:20,101 --> 01:29:22,661
'Prince' Asoka?

740
01:29:29,611 --> 01:29:34,446
You'll stay here.
-Pawan is waiting for me.

741
01:29:34,616 --> 01:29:36,413
His kind never return.

742
01:29:36,584 --> 01:29:40,042
He will, Bheema. His horse is here.

743
01:29:47,729 --> 01:29:50,926
How is the wound now, friend...
Prince?

744
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:57,631
Prince, my problem is that my fist
moves faster than my mind.

745
01:29:57,839 --> 01:29:59,466
Why haven't you left?

746
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:01,302
How could l?

747
01:30:01,476 --> 01:30:06,914
You saved my life.
It's my duty to guard you for life.

748
01:30:07,082 --> 01:30:12,520
From now, in war and victory,
Virat will stand by you.

749
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:16,520
I want death not victory.

750
01:30:20,662 --> 01:30:23,096
Was she beautiful, Prince?

751
01:30:28,937 --> 01:30:30,495
Very.

752
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:36,768
Are you going to Pawan?
-Yes.

753
01:30:36,945 --> 01:30:39,470
I will come too.

754
01:30:39,647 --> 01:30:42,138
You will not.
You will go to Kalinga with Bheema.

755
01:30:42,317 --> 01:30:45,684
If I don't go, you don't either.
Should I call Bheema?

756
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,319
Call him.

757
01:30:49,257 --> 01:30:51,054
Come on.

758
01:30:51,226 --> 01:30:53,717
Iets take Pawan's horse with us too.

759
01:30:55,163 --> 01:30:57,961
How much longer?
-I don't know.

760
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:12,138
Asoka's winning war after war.
He seems undaunted by death.

761
01:31:12,313 --> 01:31:16,750
Each victory is a step closer
to the throne.

762
01:31:16,918 --> 01:31:20,081
You must stop him at Ujjaini itself.

763
01:31:59,627 --> 01:32:01,492
Friend.

764
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:47,269
Do you know any Pawan? A soldier
in the Magadha Army, rides a horse.

765
01:32:47,442 --> 01:32:48,841
No.

766
01:33:04,292 --> 01:33:06,954
Iet's go. It's raining.

767
01:33:07,128 --> 01:33:09,653
Come.

768
01:33:17,272 --> 01:33:23,905
No herb or medicine is helping him.

769
01:33:24,078 --> 01:33:28,879
How does one save the life of a man
who has no desire to live?

770
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:40,125
Kaur...waki, Kaur...waki.

771
01:33:41,529 --> 01:33:42,928
'Kaurwaki'?

772
01:33:47,135 --> 01:33:50,536
Prime Minister, where is Asoka?
-I don't know.

773
01:33:50,705 --> 01:33:54,004
You don't?
Or are you hiding something?

774
01:33:54,175 --> 01:33:57,770
Why all this loyalty to Asoka?

775
01:33:57,945 --> 01:34:01,642
My loyalty is to the throne of Magadha.

776
01:34:07,789 --> 01:34:10,553
Prince Asoka is getting better, isn't he?

777
01:34:10,725 --> 01:34:14,627
Physical wounds will heal.
But wounds of the heart...

778
01:34:14,862 --> 01:34:19,424
Haven't you seen how he calls out
her name even in his sleep?

779
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:24,663
Kaurwaki, Kaurwaki, Kaurwaki.

780
01:34:24,872 --> 01:34:26,965
Are you crying?

781
01:34:27,141 --> 01:34:32,204
You see, my heart is rather tender.

782
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:35,178
Kaurwaki was very lovely?
-Yes.

783
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:44,315
But you are too. You too.
And you, most of all.

784
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:50,121
What kind of love is this
that lives on even after death?

785
01:34:53,067 --> 01:34:57,902
When you left you did not look
back even once.

786
01:35:10,284 --> 01:35:13,617
A bright glow

787
01:35:13,855 --> 01:35:15,186
pervades

788
01:35:17,225 --> 01:35:20,126
and fills

789
01:35:20,294 --> 01:35:22,728
your eyes

790
01:35:24,065 --> 01:35:26,863
Your eyes warn...

791
01:35:27,001 --> 01:35:30,095
''Don't touch me''

792
01:35:43,951 --> 01:35:50,515
Your dreams too...

793
01:35:50,725 --> 01:35:53,956
are reflected

794
01:35:54,128 --> 01:35:57,359
in your eyes

795
01:36:17,752 --> 01:36:20,983
I've searched and searched for you...

796
01:36:21,189 --> 01:36:24,215
In the sweep of the skies above

797
01:36:24,425 --> 01:36:31,297
hoping to find you encased in a cloud

798
01:36:34,735 --> 01:36:37,932
I have looked and looked for you

799
01:36:38,105 --> 01:36:41,131
in every nook and corner

800
01:36:41,275 --> 01:36:48,408
hoping to spy you walking
on a river bank

801
01:37:43,471 --> 01:37:46,736
I held on to time

802
01:37:46,908 --> 01:37:50,036
To ask where you are

803
01:37:50,177 --> 01:37:53,442
I asked the river

804
01:37:53,614 --> 01:37:57,710
and the vast ocean

805
01:38:00,354 --> 01:38:06,657
I walked the crest of waves

806
01:38:07,094 --> 01:38:13,294
feeling your caress

807
01:39:04,518 --> 01:39:06,850
Stop. What are you doing?

808
01:39:09,991 --> 01:39:13,324
I won't let you kill this harmless bird.

809
01:39:13,494 --> 01:39:14,825
Move away.

810
01:39:14,996 --> 01:39:18,329
Why?
It deserves to live as much as I do.

811
01:39:18,499 --> 01:39:22,902
Move !
-Release the arrow.

812
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:48,253
Devi...

813
01:39:48,429 --> 01:39:52,661
Where were you, Devi?
The ceremony awaits you.

814
01:39:55,836 --> 01:39:57,269
Come, dear, come here.

815
01:39:57,438 --> 01:40:00,339
She's eXquisite.

816
01:40:03,511 --> 01:40:06,742
They make a lovely couple.

817
01:40:14,388 --> 01:40:16,117
I met Prince Asoka today...

818
01:40:16,323 --> 01:40:19,986
She's so shy.
She's quite spirited though.

819
01:40:20,161 --> 01:40:21,594
He's become so vicious.

820
01:40:21,796 --> 01:40:24,287
Everyone's scared of him but not me.

821
01:40:24,432 --> 01:40:27,424
Why whisper? Tell us too.
What do you think of our son?

822
01:40:27,568 --> 01:40:31,163
Tell me, dear. Are you happy?

823
01:40:31,338 --> 01:40:35,138
Congratulations, she has agreed.

824
01:40:38,212 --> 01:40:42,546
Asoka's in Ujjaini, badly wounded.
-Take advantage of this, Sugatra.

825
01:40:42,717 --> 01:40:47,848
How? He is guarded on all sides.
It's impossible to break through.

826
01:40:48,055 --> 01:40:52,788
Difficult but not impossible.

827
01:41:00,534 --> 01:41:02,593
Here, take this medicine.

828
01:41:02,737 --> 01:41:06,104
With this your fever will lessen
and you'll sleep well.

829
01:41:06,273 --> 01:41:08,298
It's Devi's wedding today.
She won't be here.

830
01:41:08,476 --> 01:41:12,105
Today, you will listen to me instead.
Drink it?

831
01:41:13,614 --> 01:41:15,104
A little more?

832
01:41:26,961 --> 01:41:29,794
I forgot to apply the herbal paste
on Prince Asoka's wounds.

833
01:41:29,964 --> 01:41:34,162
Grandmother, I'll be back soon.

834
01:41:38,472 --> 01:41:40,963
Make something for me as well.

835
01:41:42,042 --> 01:41:43,373
Halt.

836
01:41:43,544 --> 01:41:45,978
What are you taking inside?
-Medicine.

837
01:41:47,882 --> 01:41:49,281
Go in.

838
01:41:51,919 --> 01:41:54,183
Pass me some water, please.

839
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:06,129
Who's there? Wait.
What are you feeding him?

840
01:42:07,968 --> 01:42:09,367
Iet go.

841
01:42:30,057 --> 01:42:31,456
Friend?

842
01:42:46,473 --> 01:42:51,308
Prince Asoka? Here?

843
01:43:03,824 --> 01:43:05,291
How did this happen?

844
01:43:05,492 --> 01:43:06,925
Come on let's go.

845
01:43:07,094 --> 01:43:09,153
This wedding cannot be.

846
01:43:15,870 --> 01:43:19,465
Where are you going?
Please don't go.

847
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:22,438
It's no fault of this child.

848
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:27,240
You've no right
to ruin her life like this.

849
01:43:27,414 --> 01:43:30,008
I will not let you leave.

850
01:43:33,053 --> 01:43:36,454
I request you to please wait.

851
01:43:37,758 --> 01:43:43,822
If the Prince's request is a command,
we will not leave.

852
01:43:50,838 --> 01:43:53,807
Poor Devi.
Who will marry her now?

853
01:45:23,397 --> 01:45:25,957
You won't push me again,
will you?

854
01:45:28,302 --> 01:45:30,031
My warrior.

855
01:45:43,083 --> 01:45:46,382
Did she love you
as much as you love her?

856
01:45:49,556 --> 01:45:55,495
I know that only Kaurwaki
lives in your heart.

857
01:45:55,696 --> 01:45:58,187
I cannot take her place.

858
01:46:01,435 --> 01:46:03,926
Please forgive me, Devi.

859
01:46:04,104 --> 01:46:10,805
Why? There's so much love
in your heart. Maybe my destiny...

860
01:46:14,181 --> 01:46:17,014
No. It's not love, only pain.

861
01:46:19,053 --> 01:46:26,824
Iove wounds in a way
that does not let you live or die.

862
01:46:29,763 --> 01:46:34,826
If I had seen her just one last time.

863
01:46:37,171 --> 01:46:40,504
Kaurwaki is right here with you,
in your heart.

864
01:46:40,674 --> 01:46:43,643
But where was I
when she needed me?

865
01:46:44,912 --> 01:46:46,504
I promised her...

866
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:49,808
that while I was there
she would come to no harm.

867
01:46:49,983 --> 01:46:53,214
Where was l, Devi?

868
01:46:54,555 --> 01:46:58,013
Where was I when she was dying?

869
01:46:59,526 --> 01:47:05,396
Where, when she took Pawan's name
in her parting breath?

870
01:47:36,063 --> 01:47:38,827
The intoXication
of our night together

871
01:47:38,999 --> 01:47:42,025
Has not left me

872
01:47:52,746 --> 01:47:58,116
The sensuousness of your body
is still entwined in my arms

873
01:47:58,285 --> 01:48:03,621
I opened my eyes
but that didn't disturb my dream

874
01:48:03,957 --> 01:48:06,357
Yes. I recall

875
01:48:06,727 --> 01:48:09,423
Yes. I do

876
01:48:09,596 --> 01:48:14,795
The dream which your lips gifted
me stays with each breath I take

877
01:48:48,635 --> 01:48:51,297
Even in your absence

878
01:48:51,438 --> 01:48:54,236
The thought of you eXcites me

879
01:48:54,408 --> 01:48:59,209
When I turn over in my sleep
my dream just takes another hue

880
01:48:59,379 --> 01:49:01,904
When the thought of you
enters my mind

881
01:49:02,082 --> 01:49:07,349
those moments bubble
under a sheet of water

882
01:49:07,554 --> 01:49:10,387
My body is on fire

883
01:49:10,557 --> 01:49:13,048
Yes. I recall

884
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:15,592
Yes. I do...

885
01:50:11,785 --> 01:50:17,280
The seasons that bind
you to me are countless

886
01:50:17,491 --> 01:50:19,925
They contain promise
of several lifetimes

887
01:50:20,093 --> 01:50:22,425
My sorrows are trivial

888
01:50:22,596 --> 01:50:27,932
I wish for a long night
and a longer day

889
01:50:28,101 --> 01:50:33,471
I wish for a life endless
enough to contain our togetherness

890
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:39,078
Yes, I recall
Yes, I do

891
01:50:39,246 --> 01:50:45,276
The dream your lips have gifted
me lingers with each breath I take.

892
01:51:24,758 --> 01:51:28,489
I am looking for Pawan,
a soldier in the Magadha Army.

893
01:51:28,662 --> 01:51:31,222
Pawan? We don't know.

894
01:51:31,398 --> 01:51:34,231
Ask her, she knows everything.

895
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:46,641
I too waited for a long time
for him but he never came back.

896
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:48,975
What kind of people are these?

897
01:51:49,116 --> 01:51:50,640
Come on, let's go.

898
01:51:50,817 --> 01:51:55,254
As per your wish, your highness.
We have served food to all.

899
01:51:58,492 --> 01:52:02,258
Eat well, such a feast is rare.

900
01:52:02,429 --> 01:52:07,628
Mother, look. she is Devi, the girl
that Prince Asoka has married.

901
01:52:12,606 --> 01:52:15,598
Please serve to those there
and those too.

902
01:52:18,278 --> 01:52:26,083
Have you heard? Prince Asoka
is returning to Magadha with Devi.

903
01:52:27,554 --> 01:52:31,285
The stars predict tension
in their marriage.

904
01:52:31,458 --> 01:52:33,983
You and your stars. They're married
so what tension could there be?

905
01:52:34,194 --> 01:52:35,991
Here, eat sweetmeats.

906
01:52:36,163 --> 01:52:40,361
Why are you distributing sweets?
-His wife gave birth to a son.

907
01:52:40,534 --> 01:52:44,868
But you have not been
home for more than a year, right?

908
01:52:45,038 --> 01:52:47,871
We were his emissaries in love.
-But...

909
01:52:48,575 --> 01:52:52,272
No buts... give your sweets and go.

910
01:52:57,651 --> 01:53:01,143
Iong live Prince Asoka.

911
01:53:11,932 --> 01:53:13,661
You're here to see
Prince Asoka as well?

912
01:53:13,834 --> 01:53:16,632
No, I am looking for Pawan.

913
01:53:28,982 --> 01:53:31,212
Iook who's coming.

914
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:42,920
Iet's go from here. Come Arya.

915
01:53:45,298 --> 01:53:49,234
I will not go.
-Enough of this madness.

916
01:53:49,402 --> 01:53:56,240
You have looked for him enough.
-I will not leave without Pawan.

917
01:53:56,409 --> 01:54:01,142
Do as you please.
Iook for your Pawan.

918
01:54:01,281 --> 01:54:05,877
When you're done, return to Kalinga.
Prince Arya. Iet's go.

919
01:54:06,052 --> 01:54:08,520
I don't want to go.

920
01:54:08,722 --> 01:54:10,781
Bheema, let go.

921
01:54:48,295 --> 01:54:57,397
He acted as he thought appropriate.
Give him my blessings.

922
01:54:57,571 --> 01:55:00,540
Your Majesty, at least meet him once.

923
01:55:00,707 --> 01:55:04,143
There is no place for a Buddhist girl
in this family.

924
01:55:07,247 --> 01:55:10,808
Tell Asoka to return to Ujjaini.

925
01:55:31,605 --> 01:55:37,043
General. We feared that even you...

926
01:55:41,214 --> 01:55:43,079
General, I promise you...

927
01:55:43,249 --> 01:55:48,186
Whoever conspired to kill Prince Arya...

928
01:55:48,388 --> 01:55:50,948
will be severely punished.

929
01:55:51,157 --> 01:55:57,027
No need of that. Prince Arya
and Princess Kaurwaki are alive.

930
01:55:57,163 --> 01:55:58,721
Impossible.

931
01:55:58,898 --> 01:56:00,297
Arya...

932
01:56:08,508 --> 01:56:11,136
This is not possible.

933
01:56:11,311 --> 01:56:14,576
You have lost, Prime Minister.
Your conspiracy misfired.

934
01:56:14,748 --> 01:56:21,119
A lie. I have served Kalinga all my life.

935
01:56:21,321 --> 01:56:22,879
I am innocent.

936
01:56:23,089 --> 01:56:27,651
Forgive me, Minister.
They've come to know.

937
01:56:27,861 --> 01:56:29,829
Take him away.

938
01:56:32,499 --> 01:56:34,262
Such a traitor should be sentenced
to death.

939
01:56:34,434 --> 01:56:37,426
Take him away.
-I am innocent.

940
01:56:58,425 --> 01:57:01,952
Didn't I promise you that
we will be together in Kalinga?

941
01:57:02,128 --> 01:57:06,087
Yes, only Pawan is not with us.

942
01:57:06,266 --> 01:57:09,758
How much longer will you wait for him?

943
01:57:09,936 --> 01:57:11,801
Till his return.

944
01:57:13,406 --> 01:57:15,806
If he doesn't?

945
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:21,572
That could be.
But I'll still wait for him.

946
01:57:26,086 --> 01:57:28,782
You knew I would not spare your life.

947
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:35,691
Even then, you joined hands
with Susima?

948
01:57:35,895 --> 01:57:40,423
What's your life worth now?
Answer me?

949
01:57:49,709 --> 01:57:51,074
What is it?

950
01:57:51,244 --> 01:57:52,711
I must tell you something.

951
01:57:52,879 --> 01:57:54,244
Go on.

952
01:57:55,615 --> 01:57:58,049
Calm down first.

953
01:58:08,461 --> 01:58:10,019
What is it?

954
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,999
What is it?

955
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:18,637
What is it?

956
01:58:26,446 --> 01:58:31,008
A son? My son?

957
01:58:34,788 --> 01:58:37,723
I will teach him everything.

958
01:58:37,924 --> 01:58:39,414
Everything.

959
01:58:42,662 --> 01:58:45,153
I will teach him to fight
with the sword.

960
01:58:45,331 --> 01:58:49,324
I will teach him
to fight like a warrior.

961
01:58:49,502 --> 01:58:51,663
My son.

962
01:58:51,838 --> 01:58:53,738
The first heir to the Mauryan empire.

963
01:58:53,940 --> 01:58:55,840
The Emperor of Magadha.

964
01:58:58,878 --> 01:59:01,676
I will take him in my arms
and put him on the throne.

965
01:59:01,848 --> 01:59:03,975
What if it is a daughter?

966
01:59:05,852 --> 01:59:09,788
No. It will be a son.

967
01:59:12,792 --> 01:59:19,027
Go and tell Susima, it will be a son,
the emperor of Magadha.

968
01:59:47,594 --> 01:59:51,724
Wasn't it your dream
that I sit on the throne?

969
01:59:51,898 --> 01:59:56,460
I give you my word
I will strive to be an able King.

970
01:59:57,971 --> 02:00:00,838
You will be proud of your Susima.

971
02:00:02,976 --> 02:00:05,206
Devi is eXpecting.

972
02:00:05,378 --> 02:00:11,044
Susima, the word is out
that an heir is to be born.

973
02:00:11,217 --> 02:00:16,883
Asoka's son will occupy the throne.
-The people will never accept him.

974
02:00:17,090 --> 02:00:19,957
Am I right, pundit-ji?
-That's right.

975
02:00:20,093 --> 02:00:24,496
A son born of a Buddhist mother
cannot claim the throne.

976
02:00:24,697 --> 02:00:27,757
The people have no choice, Susima.

977
02:00:27,934 --> 02:00:31,870
And you? You're incapable
of producing an heir.

978
02:00:33,273 --> 02:00:36,470
It's destiny.

979
02:00:39,245 --> 02:00:43,944
You tell me, Pundit-ji.
What fate awaits Asoka's child?

980
02:00:45,551 --> 02:00:52,423
Think before you answer, pundit-ji.
What fate awaits Asoka's child?

981
02:00:52,592 --> 02:00:55,925
Asoka's son will not live.

982
02:00:59,065 --> 02:01:01,431
Destiny. It's all destiny.

983
02:01:38,705 --> 02:01:40,070
Who is there?

984
02:01:57,457 --> 02:02:00,324
There is someone here. Soldier.

985
02:02:41,367 --> 02:02:43,733
Everybody leave.
-Friend?

986
02:02:43,903 --> 02:02:45,427
I said, everyone leave.

987
02:02:45,605 --> 02:02:47,038
Ieave.

988
02:02:47,206 --> 02:02:48,639
Come.

989
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:55,271
Speak to me, Mother.

990
02:03:01,354 --> 02:03:04,016
Please, Mother. Talk to me.

991
02:03:11,531 --> 02:03:18,266
I did all that you asked me to.
Please, Mother, talk to me once.

992
02:03:27,713 --> 02:03:32,844
Speak to me just once,
for just one moment.

993
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:38,647
If something happens to you,
all hell will break loose.

994
02:03:38,858 --> 02:03:43,090
I will destroy everything.
Everything.

995
02:03:44,297 --> 02:03:48,893
Vitasoka, tell Mother to talk to me.

996
02:03:56,943 --> 02:03:59,275
Please, speak to me.

997
02:04:36,015 --> 02:04:40,281
Please don't.
-Don't stop me today.

998
02:04:40,486 --> 02:04:42,283
Somebody has to stop.

999
02:04:42,488 --> 02:04:46,447
Anger destroys everything.
-Then let it.

1000
02:04:48,594 --> 02:04:54,089
I will never let you touch my child
with a killer's hands.

1001
02:05:29,068 --> 02:05:33,664
So, you've come to kill your brother?

1002
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:40,906
Kill me.

1003
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:42,445
Pick up the sword, Susima.

1004
02:05:42,615 --> 02:05:47,143
What about your mother's death?
Take your revenge, Asoka.

1005
02:05:47,353 --> 02:05:51,153
Why hesitate? Go ahead, kill me.

1006
02:05:51,324 --> 02:05:53,554
Pick up the sword, Susima.

1007
02:05:53,726 --> 02:06:00,131
Your mother was like my own.
I'd love your son as my own.

1008
02:06:00,299 --> 02:06:08,138
Only if you were not Asoka.
But you are Asoka. It's destiny.

1009
02:06:10,009 --> 02:06:12,671
Pick up the sword, Susima.

1010
02:06:12,845 --> 02:06:16,303
To help you defeat me?

1011
02:06:17,383 --> 02:06:21,285
I won't allow you that pleasure.

1012
02:06:21,487 --> 02:06:25,218
Iet history note
that Asoka did not win the throne...

1013
02:06:25,391 --> 02:06:27,825
he had to kill to get it.

1014
02:06:29,962 --> 02:06:32,362
Pick up the sword, Susima.
-No.

1015
02:06:32,531 --> 02:06:37,764
I was not a murderer, Asoka.
You left me with no choice.

1016
02:06:37,970 --> 02:06:43,067
Moment to moment I lived in fear
of your snatching the throne from me.

1017
02:06:44,343 --> 02:06:49,542
To sit on the throne
you must kill your own brother.

1018
02:06:49,715 --> 02:06:53,173
You will have to become 'Susima'.

1019
02:06:53,352 --> 02:07:00,815
Kill me, Asoka. Kill me.
You need courage to sit on the throne...

1020
02:07:00,993 --> 02:07:04,121
and also to kill your brother.

1021
02:07:05,197 --> 02:07:06,858
Kill me, Asoka.

1022
02:07:22,982 --> 02:07:28,045
I knew that you are incapable
of killing your siblings.

1023
02:07:29,155 --> 02:07:31,851
I know you cannot.

1024
02:07:32,858 --> 02:07:37,090
That's why the throne is mine,
not your's.

1025
02:07:49,041 --> 02:07:50,440
Destiny...

1026
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:03,411
What should I do with the brothers?

1027
02:08:18,237 --> 02:08:20,034
Kill them all.

1028
02:08:39,558 --> 02:08:42,049
I have killed all my brothers, Susima.

1029
02:08:43,829 --> 02:08:46,696
Now can I sit on the throne?

1030
02:08:59,745 --> 02:09:03,010
Iong live King Asoka.

1031
02:09:10,956 --> 02:09:15,825
What's the matter?
Why are you all so quiet?

1032
02:09:15,961 --> 02:09:19,727
There's nothing left to say.

1033
02:09:19,932 --> 02:09:22,628
Asoka killed all his brothers.
And no one said a word.

1034
02:09:22,802 --> 02:09:26,568
Who can say anything?
Even King Bindusara is no more.

1035
02:09:26,739 --> 02:09:28,001
Entire Magadha is terror-struck.

1036
02:09:28,174 --> 02:09:29,334
Strange.

1037
02:09:29,508 --> 02:09:30,907
Keep quiet, idiot.

1038
02:09:31,043 --> 02:09:34,877
Know what people are saying?
An evil man now rules over Magadha.

1039
02:09:35,047 --> 02:09:36,378
'Evil' Asoka.

1040
02:09:42,721 --> 02:09:46,657
You will not go anywhere, Devi.
You know I will not let you go.

1041
02:09:46,859 --> 02:09:50,386
I am leaving.
-What was I to do?

1042
02:09:50,563 --> 02:09:53,828
They killed Mother.
I should forgive them?

1043
02:09:54,033 --> 02:09:55,557
Yes.

1044
02:09:55,734 --> 02:09:57,668
I don't have such a big heart.

1045
02:09:58,971 --> 02:10:02,270
I know. That's why I am leaving.

1046
02:10:04,043 --> 02:10:05,908
You are not leaving.

1047
02:10:10,549 --> 02:10:14,485
I am going.

1048
02:10:18,591 --> 02:10:21,253
You should know.
Where is Sugatra hiding?

1049
02:10:21,427 --> 02:10:24,760
He won't say anything.
He does not know.

1050
02:10:24,930 --> 02:10:27,023
Then his life is meaningless.

1051
02:10:27,199 --> 02:10:30,191
Friend, please stop. Enough.

1052
02:10:31,303 --> 02:10:33,794
Nothing will stop me now, Virat.

1053
02:10:34,006 --> 02:10:38,033
I will be the greatest emperor on earth.

1054
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:44,149
Greater than King Bindusara,
stronger than Chandragupta Maurya.

1055
02:10:44,316 --> 02:10:45,943
The greatest, ever.

1056
02:10:47,419 --> 02:10:55,793
Susima said, ''To rule an empire,
to be a great Emperor...

1057
02:10:56,028 --> 02:10:58,155
one needs to kill.''

1058
02:11:34,533 --> 02:11:40,233
Please rest, Prince Sugatra.
Give the senate time to think about it.

1059
02:11:40,406 --> 02:11:44,740
My death is certain if Kalinga
does not grant me asylum.

1060
02:11:44,877 --> 02:11:48,711
I plead with the senate of Kalinga
to protect my life.

1061
02:11:51,684 --> 02:11:57,213
Kalinga has given asylum to Sugatra.

1062
02:11:57,423 --> 02:12:00,358
Why? Had they not heard my order?

1063
02:12:00,559 --> 02:12:08,022
They say Kalinga owes nothing
to a man who killed his brothers.

1064
02:12:16,709 --> 02:12:18,700
My relationship with Kalinga
is a strange one.

1065
02:12:18,877 --> 02:12:22,005
Till today no one has attacked Kalinga.

1066
02:12:22,181 --> 02:12:24,240
Kalinga is a democracy.

1067
02:12:24,416 --> 02:12:26,941
Your grandfather dreamt
of a united lndia.

1068
02:12:27,086 --> 02:12:29,213
Make that dream come true.

1069
02:12:29,421 --> 02:12:31,355
Attack Kalinga.

1070
02:12:32,458 --> 02:12:33,789
Kalinga.

1071
02:12:37,796 --> 02:12:40,356
We will always win.

1072
02:12:40,499 --> 02:12:45,436
Pawan's with the Magadha Army.
Will he too fight us?

1073
02:12:45,604 --> 02:12:50,337
Pawan will never fight us.
-That's true.

1074
02:12:54,747 --> 02:12:58,911
Order me, Your Majesty. I'll make
them stare into the eyes of death.

1075
02:12:59,084 --> 02:13:01,780
Fear will render them useless.
They will forget patriotism.

1076
02:13:02,021 --> 02:13:07,721
What are you saying?
Friend, this is against the rules of war.

1077
02:13:08,794 --> 02:13:13,754
War has only one rule, Virat.
Victory.

1078
02:13:18,070 --> 02:13:21,631
We'll burn their houses,
destroy their fields.

1079
02:13:29,882 --> 02:13:35,115
I told your father. This village,
these homes, these people...

1080
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:39,484
all belong to Emperor Asoka.
Which means all belong to me.

1081
02:13:39,692 --> 02:13:41,956
You too are mine.

1082
02:13:44,530 --> 02:13:47,328
Your father is very brave.

1083
02:13:59,344 --> 02:14:04,805
Such cruelty? ls he human
or a monster? Who is this Asoka?

1084
02:14:05,017 --> 02:14:10,956
Why kill so many innocent people?
-He'll do anything to win the war.

1085
02:14:11,123 --> 02:14:15,890
He has not spared his own brothers.
-Then he must die.

1086
02:14:17,262 --> 02:14:20,493
I can take you to Asoka.
-Iet's go.

1087
02:14:23,702 --> 02:14:25,829
Kalinga has attacked!

1088
02:16:05,437 --> 02:16:07,029
Iook, there he is.

1089
02:16:19,351 --> 02:16:20,750
Sugatra?

1090
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:23,749
Come, come, Sugatra.

1091
02:16:26,024 --> 02:16:29,858
You've missed your brothers so much
that you came to meet them?

1092
02:16:33,465 --> 02:16:37,231
You want to fight me?
One more time?

1093
02:16:40,205 --> 02:16:42,366
You won't face me?

1094
02:16:43,408 --> 02:16:45,933
All right then,
strike from behind.

1095
02:16:47,846 --> 02:16:50,007
Come Sugatra. Attack me !

1096
02:16:51,984 --> 02:16:54,009
Come, attack me.

1097
02:16:59,224 --> 02:17:02,591
You can kill me...
but you can never defeat Kalinga.

1098
02:17:03,595 --> 02:17:07,531
The Magadha flag will
tower over blood-stained Kalinga.

1099
02:17:14,473 --> 02:17:17,203
Give my greetings to Susima,
my loving brother.

1100
02:17:59,418 --> 02:18:02,478
What will become of us, now.
How will we fight this war?

1101
02:18:07,326 --> 02:18:11,456
This is not mere soil.
It is our ancestral heritage.

1102
02:18:13,065 --> 02:18:16,228
Nobody can take it from us.

1103
02:18:16,401 --> 02:18:19,962
Should we lose,
what will we tell our children?

1104
02:18:20,138 --> 02:18:23,369
Why should we lose?
Why should we not fight?

1105
02:18:23,542 --> 02:18:27,478
We will fight... together !

1106
02:18:27,646 --> 02:18:31,946
All my sons were killed in the war.
Had I one more, he would fight too.

1107
02:18:32,117 --> 02:18:35,177
She is my daughter.
Now she will fight.

1108
02:18:35,387 --> 02:18:39,289
Every man in Kalinga will fight.
-Every woman in Kalinga will fight.

1109
02:18:40,859 --> 02:18:45,990
Yes, we will all fight !

1110
02:19:34,212 --> 02:19:38,478
You don't know him.
He will do anything to defeat Kalinga.

1111
02:19:38,650 --> 02:19:40,618
At any cost he wants victory.

1112
02:19:40,786 --> 02:19:42,344
Only victory.

1113
02:19:42,554 --> 02:19:47,821
My wish is that
when my child opens his eyes...

1114
02:19:47,993 --> 02:19:51,724
he should see only love not death.

1115
02:19:51,897 --> 02:19:58,393
The first words he hears
should be of love, not shrieks of pain.

1116
02:20:01,973 --> 02:20:06,376
Everything will be destroyed.
Everything.

1117
02:20:17,956 --> 02:20:21,483
Where to, friend?
-A war awaits me. Have you forgotten?

1118
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:24,194
Before that you have
to fight another war.

1119
02:20:24,362 --> 02:20:27,126
Really? Who is this new enemy?

1120
02:20:29,267 --> 02:20:31,599
The one who stands in front of you.

1121
02:20:39,845 --> 02:20:46,148
No. You are a friend, my only friend.

1122
02:20:46,284 --> 02:20:50,186
Then listen to your friend and stop.
Enough !

1123
02:20:50,355 --> 02:20:52,949
When will you stop killing
innocent people?

1124
02:20:53,158 --> 02:20:55,126
How much longer will you fight?

1125
02:20:55,327 --> 02:20:56,988
Till I win.

1126
02:20:57,162 --> 02:20:59,255
Till I win it all.

1127
02:20:59,431 --> 02:21:01,899
Then today you will not win over me.

1128
02:21:02,067 --> 02:21:03,728
One moment...

1129
02:21:07,839 --> 02:21:12,833
You will kill your own friend?
-I will go to any length to stop you.

1130
02:21:19,718 --> 02:21:23,154
Remember, friend, the 1 9th tactic?

1131
02:22:12,304 --> 02:22:15,671
Enough, Virat !
-No ! Never.

1132
02:22:39,931 --> 02:22:43,924
You're alive...
because you are a friend

1133
02:22:44,669 --> 02:22:46,864
You are nobody's friend.

1134
02:23:00,385 --> 02:23:02,410
You are your own enemy.

1135
02:23:02,621 --> 02:23:04,680
That's why you are called
'Evil' Asoka !

1136
02:23:04,923 --> 02:23:06,686
'Evil' Asoka !

1137
02:23:44,663 --> 02:23:47,723
Today we'll have a feast
in Kalinga.

1138
02:23:49,768 --> 02:23:52,498
But Emperor Asoka has
not come yet.

1139
02:23:52,671 --> 02:23:56,107
You don't need
elephants to crush ants.

1140
02:23:57,342 --> 02:23:59,367
Charge !

1141
02:24:48,493 --> 02:24:51,792
Come on, move back !

1142
02:24:55,667 --> 02:24:56,998
Follow them.

1143
02:24:59,971 --> 02:25:03,532
Cowards ! Running away
from the battle field?

1144
02:29:35,246 --> 02:29:37,111
Pawan !

1145
02:31:20,952 --> 02:31:23,580
We have lost the war.
-We cannot lose.

1146
02:31:23,788 --> 02:31:28,088
I will go and fight.
We cannot lose !

1147
02:31:28,259 --> 02:31:33,287
Please don't go, Prince.
Please stop.

1148
02:31:52,350 --> 02:31:54,910
What happened, Vitasoka?

1149
02:31:55,086 --> 02:31:58,681
You wanted to be a poet.
Then why this guise?

1150
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:09,259
I know what you want to say.
The tormentor Asoka ! Evil Asoka !

1151
02:32:10,301 --> 02:32:14,761
Is that what you want to tell me?
I have heard it all before.

1152
02:32:16,307 --> 02:32:20,073
I have come to tell you that
you have become a father.

1153
02:32:27,051 --> 02:32:28,382
My son !

1154
02:32:30,254 --> 02:32:34,156
Mahendra is your son and
Sanghamitra is your daughter.

1155
02:32:38,095 --> 02:32:40,290
Where is Devi, Vitasoka?

1156
02:32:41,465 --> 02:32:45,128
I am their father, Vitasoka.

1157
02:32:45,303 --> 02:32:48,830
You are only an Emperor.
Emperor Asoka.

1158
02:32:50,741 --> 02:32:53,904
Donning another garb does not
change the truth, Vitasoka.

1159
02:32:54,078 --> 02:33:00,711
War is the truth. Wars happen.
In war, you either win or die.

1160
02:33:00,918 --> 02:33:04,547
And I have won, Vitasoka!
I have won.

1161
02:33:06,190 --> 02:33:09,717
Yes, you have. You have won
the tears of widows...

1162
02:33:09,927 --> 02:33:14,626
the cries of orphans
and enflamed bodies.

1163
02:33:14,832 --> 02:33:16,800
You have won it all.

1164
02:33:21,772 --> 02:33:25,503
Vitasoka, I have won.

1165
02:33:26,711 --> 02:33:30,169
I have won, Vitasoka.

1166
02:33:49,066 --> 02:33:51,830
We've never collected so much wealth
in any other war, as this.

1167
02:33:51,969 --> 02:33:55,132
We've never killed so many people
in any other war, as this.

1168
02:33:55,306 --> 02:33:58,275
The bigger the victory,
the more the wealth !

1169
02:33:59,543 --> 02:34:05,038
You have stumbled on a fortune,
such a beautiful and strong horse.

1170
02:34:05,216 --> 02:34:07,582
They say it belongs to 'Kaurwaki',
the one who inspired...

1171
02:34:07,785 --> 02:34:10,583
the farmers and women to fight
against Magadha's army.

1172
02:34:10,788 --> 02:34:14,724
Who cares?
The horse will fetch a handsome price.

1173
02:34:28,906 --> 02:34:30,237
Kaurwaki...

1174
02:37:05,729 --> 02:37:07,492
Water...

1175
02:38:34,451 --> 02:38:37,249
You have not won...

1176
02:38:37,454 --> 02:38:40,582
I'll never let you win.

1177
02:38:40,791 --> 02:38:42,418
Kaurwaki.

1178
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:48,360
I am alive ! You have to fight me.

1179
02:38:50,968 --> 02:38:54,301
Throw down your sword Kaurwaki,
the war is over.

1180
02:38:54,471 --> 02:38:59,238
The war is not over.
You have to kill me too.

1181
02:39:01,645 --> 02:39:04,739
How can I kill you?
I am your Pawan.

1182
02:39:09,853 --> 02:39:17,282
You are not my Pawan.
You are Asoka... Asoka !

1183
02:39:26,971 --> 02:39:29,098
Forgive me.

1184
02:39:39,116 --> 02:39:42,916
Why did you not come?

1185
02:39:47,591 --> 02:39:50,458
I waited so long...

1186
02:39:55,666 --> 02:40:01,536
Where did I not look for you?
I searched everywhere.

1187
02:40:14,318 --> 02:40:15,615
Pawan...

1188
02:40:18,856 --> 02:40:20,187
Arya !

1189
02:40:21,425 --> 02:40:23,120
Where were you?

1190
02:40:25,596 --> 02:40:28,622
Asoka took away all my land.

1191
02:40:28,799 --> 02:40:33,736
No one can take your land from you.
It is your's.

1192
02:40:33,904 --> 02:40:35,462
I have come back.

1193
02:40:35,639 --> 02:40:38,039
You will not go again?

1194
02:40:38,208 --> 02:40:41,041
No, never again

1195
02:40:41,945 --> 02:40:44,038
Promise me?

1196
02:40:44,214 --> 02:40:46,682
I promise.

1197
02:41:07,671 --> 02:41:10,333
See? I did not even cry.

1198
02:41:15,012 --> 02:41:18,140
Pawan? Did the prince return?

1199
02:41:23,320 --> 02:41:25,652
Yes... he did.

1200
02:41:26,590 --> 02:41:29,024
With horses and elephants?

1201
02:41:32,830 --> 02:41:35,594
With hundreds of horses
and elephants.

1202
02:41:35,799 --> 02:41:37,096
Then?

1203
02:41:40,971 --> 02:41:44,964
He took the princess
on his horse and rode away.

1204
02:41:45,142 --> 02:41:46,473
Then?

1205
02:41:52,750 --> 02:41:55,548
They lived together.

1206
02:41:56,887 --> 02:42:00,414
Happily?

1207
02:42:00,624 --> 02:42:02,353
Yes, very happily.

1208
02:42:05,562 --> 02:42:07,757
Pawan, it's getting dark.

1209
02:42:12,669 --> 02:42:16,070
The sun, moon and stars
are fading.

1210
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:18,265
No, Arya...

1211
02:42:21,245 --> 02:42:23,270
nothing will happen.

1212
02:42:23,447 --> 02:42:25,381
Nothing will happen to you.

1213
02:42:31,155 --> 02:42:36,559
The sun, the moon, the stars...
are all yours.

1214
02:42:38,662 --> 02:42:40,254
Pawan...

1215
02:43:27,778 --> 02:43:30,576
I have become the greatest emperor.

1216
02:43:31,982 --> 02:43:34,883
The mightiest ruler.

1217
02:43:37,254 --> 02:43:38,915
I have won it all.

1218
02:43:40,457 --> 02:43:44,553
I have also destroyed it all.

1219
02:43:47,264 --> 02:43:49,391
What did I win?

1220
02:43:59,810 --> 02:44:05,248
What can Emperors win?
Only wealth, land and kingdoms.

1221
02:44:05,382 --> 02:44:08,283
My destiny transcends
an Emperor's.

1222
02:44:08,452 --> 02:44:11,444
My destiny will be that
of a traveler's...

1223
02:44:11,655 --> 02:44:14,215
who completes his journey.

1224
02:44:15,392 --> 02:44:18,486
And today I start my journey.

1225
02:44:18,695 --> 02:44:23,428
Ajourney of love, peace
and nonviolence.

1226
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:49,000
