1
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,870
<Put your faith
in what you most believe in>

2
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:07,457
<Two worlds
One family>

3
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:11,251
<Trust your heart,
Let fate decide>

4
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:15,796
<To guide these lives we see>

5
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:20,466
<A paradise
untouched by man>

6
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:24,261
<Within this world
blessed with love>

7
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:29,306
<A simple life
They live in peace>

8
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:33,768
<Softly tread the sand
below your feet now>

9
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:37,479
<Two worlds
One family>

10
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:42,149
<Trust your heart
Let fate decide>

11
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:46,694
<To guide these lives we see>

12
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:51,281
<Beneath the shelter
of the trees>

13
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:55,826
<Only love can enter here>

14
00:01:55,993 --> 00:02:00,121
<A simple life
They live in peace>

15
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,832
<Raise your head up
Lift high the load>

16
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,918
<Take strength
from those that need you>

17
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:12,338
<Build high the walls
Build strong the beams>

18
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:18,676
<A new life is waiting
But danger's no stranger here>

19
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:47,156
<No words describe
a mother's tears>

20
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:52,368
<No words can heal
a broken heart>

21
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:55,829
<A dream is gone
But where there's hope>

22
00:02:55,996 --> 00:03:00,541
<Somewhere something
is calling for you>

23
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:04,001
<Two worlds
One family>

24
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:08,380
<Trust your heart
Let fate decide>

25
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:13,342
<To guide these lives we see>

26
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,126
- Huh?
- Eh?

27
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,117
Achoo!

28
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:20,317
Anh-anh-anh-anh...

29
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,759
<Every moment now
the bond grows stronger>

30
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:58,262
<Two worlds, one family>

31
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:02,682
<Trust your heart
Let fate decide>

32
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:07,686
<To guide these lives we see>

33
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:19,903
Mommy, look!
Look over there!

34
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,863
<i>- Kala!
- She's back!</i>

35
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:28,910
Are you all right,
dear?

36
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,703
I'm fine.
No, really, honestly.

37
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:34,455
It's just that I got
a little bit... sidetracked.

38
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:39,417
Well, isn't that, uh--
Well, so--

39
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:42,503
Well,
it's just so, so--

40
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,963
That's freaky-lookin', okay?
That's what it is.

41
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,965
- Terkina!
- Well, it is!

42
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:50,801
- I mean, what the heck is it anyway?
- He's a baby.

43
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:54,387
Ow! I can't--

44
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:59,140
- So, where's his mama?

45
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:02,490
Well, I'm going to be
his mother now.

46
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:11,024
You know, he's not so bad
once you get used to him.

47
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:15,069
Kala's gonna be its mother now.

48
00:09:19,197 --> 00:09:23,117
Kerchak, I saved him from Sabor.

49
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:28,996
Kala, it won't replace
the one we lost.

50
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:32,999
I know that.
But... he needs me.

51
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:37,836
But, it-it-it--
Kala, look at it.

52
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:40,213
It's not our kind.

53
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,174
No. You have to take it back.

54
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:47,051
Take him back?
But he'll die!

55
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:49,344
- If the jungle wants him--
- I want him.

56
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:51,721
Kala, I cannot let you put
our family in danger.

57
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:54,557
Does he look dangerous to you?

58
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:05,481
Hmm. Was it alone?

59
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,983
Yes.
Sabor killed his family.

60
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,153
- Are you sure?
- Yes. There are no others.

61
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:16,447
Then you may keep him.

62
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:22,035
- Kerchak, I know he'll be a good son.
- I said he could stay.

63
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,996
That doesn't make him
my son.

64
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:30,250
We will nest here
for the night.

65
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:38,172
So, um,
whatcha gonna call it?

66
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,050
I'm gonna call him...
Tarzan.

67
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:45,761
Tarzan? Okay.
He's your baby.

68
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:49,055
All right, little lady, come on.
It's way past your nest time.

69
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:51,099
- Oh, Mom, five more minutes?
- No!

70
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:53,434
- Two more minutes?
- No!

71
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,269
One more "minutes"?

72
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:02,023
Oh, no, no, no.

73
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:05,735
Shh, shh, shh. Don't cry. I'm here.

74
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:08,403
Come on, come on.

75
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,093
<Come, stop your crying
It'll be all right>

76
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:18,378
<Just take my hand
Hold it tight>

77
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:23,206
<I will protect you
from all around you>

78
00:11:23,373 --> 00:11:28,293
<I will be here
Don't you cry>

79
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,589
<For one so small
You seem so strong>

80
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:37,758
<My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm>

81
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:43,387
<This bond between us
can't be broken>

82
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:47,474
<I will be here
Don't you cry>

83
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:52,144
<'Cause you'll be in my heart>

84
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:56,230
<Yes, you'll be in my heart>

85
00:11:57,328 --> 00:12:03,068
<From this day on
Now and forever more>

86
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:11,450
<You'll be in my heart>

87
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:16,287
<No matter what they say>

88
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:20,999
<You'll be here in my heart>

89
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,709
<Always>

90
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,005
Always.

91
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:04,823
- I sure scared you, Mom. Whoa.
- You sure did!

92
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,283
Can't you imitate
any quieter animals?

93
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,827
Oh, Mom, they're no fun.
Wanna see me be a leopard?

94
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:15,956
Why don't you just
come up with your own sound?

95
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:24,023
Kala!

96
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:31,510
Oops.

97
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,511
Hee-hee.

98
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:36,013
Tarzan, thank goodness
you're all right!

99
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,891
Kala and I have been
so worried!

100
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:43,310
Thank you. Thank you so much
for finding him, Kerchak.

101
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:45,854
You are such a wise
and caring leader.

102
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,063
Run.

103
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,524
Ooh!
Um--

104
00:13:53,438 --> 00:13:56,123
- Hello! Are you thick in the head?
- What?

105
00:13:56,124 --> 00:13:57,952
How many times
do I have to tell ya?

106
00:13:57,953 --> 00:14:01,729
If you want Kerchak to like you,
stay away from him!

107
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:04,034
- Come on, Terk! Step on it!
- Last one there's a dung beetle!

108
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,828
- Yeah! And the first one's gotta eat it!
- Terk, can I come?

109
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:12,123
Well, yeah, you could if you could keep
up, but... you can't really keep up.

110
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,334
Wait up, guys.
Wait up! Right behind ya.

111
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:27,885
Ah, yeah, take that.
Stop hitting yourself.

112
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:31,846
Stop hitting yourself!
Stop hitting yourself!

113
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:35,891
<The fun has arrived>
Thank you very much.

114
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:37,559
What took you
so long?

115
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:42,270
I had a little pest control problem,
but it's all taken care of.

116
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,606
Hi, guys.

117
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:47,858
Terk, what is this?
Some kind of joke?

118
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:50,401
Tell me I'm not lookin'
at the hairless wonder.

119
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:53,362
Terk said I could come along
if I could keep up.

120
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:57,192
- Ah, no, Terk, come on!
- Terk!

121
00:14:57,193 --> 00:14:59,700
I'll handle this, guys.
Okay?

122
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:01,393
Listen, buddy, come here.

123
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:04,231
We got a tiny,
little, itsy-bitsy problem here.

124
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:07,164
Personally, I'd love to hang out
with you. You know I would.

125
00:15:07,331 --> 00:15:10,416
But the guys, they need
a little convincing, you know.

126
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,126
Okay.
What do I gotta do?

127
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:16,421
Do? What do you gotta do?
It's so stupid!

128
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:22,384
- What?
- Well, you gotta... You gotta go get a hair.

129
00:15:22,446 --> 00:15:23,216
A hair?

130
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,054
Yeah, a hair.

131
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:29,472
An elephant hair.

132
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:36,173
An elephant hair?

133
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:38,752
Like I said,
it's stupid, right?

134
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,314
Listen, take it from me.
Go home, okay?

135
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:46,110
Who needs this aggravation? You know?
I'm probably gonna leave soon myself.

136
00:15:46,276 --> 00:15:49,112
You go, I'll catch up.
All right?

137
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,115
You see? Leave it to me.
I told ya-- Tarzan!

138
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:55,575
Tarzan, no!

139
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:06,166
That one hurt him.

140
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:24,638
Look!

141
00:16:24,805 --> 00:16:28,808
- Oh, oh, there he is! He's alive!
- Hey, guys!

142
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:30,601
Hi!

143
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:34,124
Oh, no. No, no, no!

144
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,482
Come back!
Come back!

145
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:41,192
This guy's great! If he lives,
you should bring him around more often.

146
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:44,653
- Come on, let's go get a better seat.
- Ohh.

147
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:50,032
- You never get enough sleep.
- I get enough sleep.

148
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:54,869
Mom, are you sure
this water's sanitary?

149
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:57,996
It looks questionable to me.

150
00:16:58,163 --> 00:17:00,123
It's fine, honey.

151
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,757
Yech!
But what about bacteria?

152
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:08,203
Tantor, can't you see
Mommy's talking?

153
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:17,152
Watch out! There's something
swimming! It's coming right at you!

154
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:19,095
Honey, Mommy's losing
her patience.

155
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:23,168
- But this time I really see something!
- Oh, boy.

156
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:25,725
Piranha! It's a piranha!

157
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:29,584
Sweetheart, there are
no piranhas in Africa.

158
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,183
Don't tell the kid that. Of course
there are piranhas in Africa.

159
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:35,695
No, she's right.
They're native to South America.

160
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:37,333
Get outta here.

161
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:41,026
No way! Come on. Do you think
I'd be standing here if...

162
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,322
Aah! It's right behind you!
Run!

163
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:48,055
For the last time, honey, there
are no piranhas in--

164
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:49,522
My butt!

165
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:53,011
- I told you!
- There's something on my butt.

166
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:54,830
- What is it?
- Are there any more of them?

167
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:00,501
- What is it?
- It's a piranha!

168
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:02,794
Huh?

169
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:06,297
Piranha!

170
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:10,683
Tantor, where are--

171
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,602
He's dead!

172
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,603
We're dead!

173
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,443
We didn't do it!
They're the ones!

174
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,666
Oh, thank you, Kerchak.

175
00:18:58,252 --> 00:19:00,963
Tarzan, buddy! Buddy, come on.
Tarzan, don't die on me.

176
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:03,840
Don't die on me.
You weren't supposed to do it!

177
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:07,844
Get away from there! Don't you know a
piranha can strip your flesh in seconds?

178
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:10,887
What? He's not a piranha!
He's--

179
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:13,138
He's alive!

180
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:16,349
- He's alive! He's alive!
- He's alive!

181
00:19:16,516 --> 00:19:19,185
He's alive--
You idiot!

182
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:23,021
You nearly gave me a heart
attack. Ya happy?

183
00:19:23,146 --> 00:19:26,815
You-- I don't believe it.
You got the hair?

184
00:19:26,982 --> 00:19:31,569
Is that what this is all about?
I got a whole tail of them.

185
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:33,570
- Tarzan!
- Terkina!

186
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:35,155
Oh, no!

187
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:38,032
- Who's that?
- My mom.

188
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:41,159
- Tarzan!
- Hi, Aunt Kala.

189
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:44,313
- Oh, you scared me! What happened?
- Well, I--

190
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:48,271
It's sort of a long--
It's involved because what happened--

191
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:50,363
- It was a weird--
- What happened?

192
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:56,170
- It was my fault, Kerchak.
- Tarzan!

193
00:19:56,337 --> 00:20:01,007
We were playing and well--
I'm-- I'm sorry, Kerchak.

194
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:03,176
You almost killed someone!

195
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:05,386
- But it was an accident.
- He's only a child.

196
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:08,091
That's no excuse, Kala!
You can't keep defending him!

197
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:09,555
- But he'll learn!
- He will never learn!

198
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:12,874
- You can't learn to be one of us.
- Because you never give him a chance!

199
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:18,187
Give him a chance? Kala, look at him.
He will never be one of us.

200
00:20:18,354 --> 00:20:20,438
Kerchak!

201
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:22,857
Tarzan!

202
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,396
Tarzan,
what are you doing?

203
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:18,065
Why am I so different?

204
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:20,275
Because you're covered
with mud. That's why.

205
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:24,320
- No! Kerchak said I didn't
belong in the-- - Close your mouth.

206
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:25,820
Said I don't belong
in the family.

207
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:29,323
Never mind what Kerchak said.
Now, hold still!

208
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,324
But, look at me!

209
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,829
I am, Tarzan.
And do you know what I see?

210
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,998
I see two eyes,
like mine.

211
00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:44,501
And a nose...
somewhere.

212
00:21:44,668 --> 00:21:47,336
Ahh... here!

213
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:49,963
Two ears!

214
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:53,341
- And, let's see. What else?
- Two hands?

215
00:21:53,508 --> 00:21:55,342
That's right.

216
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:13,939
Close your eyes.

217
00:22:14,106 --> 00:22:18,359
Now forget what you see.
What do you feel?

218
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:21,153
My heart.

219
00:22:21,721 --> 00:22:22,801
Come here.

220
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,907
- Your heart.
- See?

221
00:22:27,074 --> 00:22:30,952
We're exactly the same.

222
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,788
Oh!
Kerchak just can't see that.

223
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,832
I'll make him see it!

224
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,251
I'll be the best ape ever!

225
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:44,879
Oh, I bet you will.

226
00:22:57,514 --> 00:23:01,141

227
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:05,019
<And the wisdom
to be wise>

228
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:09,773

that you're making>

230
00:23:14,484 --> 00:23:17,774
<There'll be answers
that you'll seek>

231
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:21,002
<And it's you who'll climb
the mountain>

232
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,745
<It's you who'll reach
the peak>

to guide you>

238
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:59,184
<No one to take your hand>

239
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:01,936
<But with faith
and understanding>

240
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:06,106

00:24:28,873 --> 00:24:32,751
<And in teaching
you will learn>

<You'll find your place

248
00:24:38,922 --> 00:24:43,134
<All and all
the things you've dreamed of>

249
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,219
<The visions that you saw>

250
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:49,639
<Well, the time
is drawing near now>

00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:53,266

257
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:42,462
Don't even think
about it.

258
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:47,098
- How'd you know it was me?
- I'm your mother. I know everything.

259
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:50,125
- Where have you been?
- I thought you knew everything.

260
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:55,503
Hey, Auntie "K."
You're looking remarkably groomed today.

261
00:25:55,504 --> 00:25:56,605
Hello, Terk.

262
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:59,805
Not the neck.
Not the neck there, "T."

00:25:59,982 --> 00:26:01,855
[Grunting And Groaning]

264
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,747
Whoa! Okay. It's all fun and games
till someone loses an eye.

265
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:12,870
Please stop.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

266
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,286
- And it's always me. Please.
- Cramp in the calf!

267
00:26:15,452 --> 00:26:19,664
Okay, you win! Ow, ow!
Okay! You win. Hello?

268
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:21,790
Yo, yo, let go!

269
00:26:22,317 --> 00:26:24,834
- Oh, sorry, Terk.
- What kind of animal are you?

270
00:26:24,982 --> 00:26:26,383
I've been thinking lately that.

271
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:29,247
Maybe Tarzan could be
some subspecies of elephant.

272
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,465
What, are you crazy?
An elephant?

273
00:26:31,698 --> 00:26:34,425
Listen to me.
Think about it. He enjoys a peanut.

274
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:37,699
- I enjoy a peanut.
- He looks nothing like you!

275
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:27,762
Okay, everybody, move aside.
Outta my way!

276
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:30,764
Best friend comin' through.
That would be me.

277
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:33,266
And you, don't make
a habit of that, okay?

278
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:35,684
There are other ways
of gettin' attention. You know?

279
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:38,228
- I'll try to remember that.
- All right.

280
00:29:38,395 --> 00:29:40,332
I was right behind ya
if you needed me.

281
00:30:18,638 --> 00:30:19,903
What was that?

282
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,719
Ayah, it wasn't me.
I swear!

283
00:30:22,845 --> 00:30:25,513
- Okay, maybe it was.
- Everyone!

284
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,556
Let's move.

285
00:31:16,312 --> 00:31:18,928
<i>This reminds me
of the safari I led up the Zambezi.</i>

286
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:23,098
<i>--Back, back,
back, back, back.</i>

287
00:31:23,264 --> 00:31:25,599
<i>Ooh, was it scary there.</i>

288
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:30,853
<i>Two men with only three rifles.
We blasted away.</i>

289
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,064
<i>That's when I knew
I was born for Africa!</i>

290
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:38,067
<i>And Africa
was created for--</i>

291
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:46,695
<i>Clayton!</i>

292
00:31:47,913 --> 00:31:49,352
Clayton!
Oh, there you are.

293
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:52,416
What is it? What is it, Clayton?
Are we in danger?

294
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,538
I thought I saw something.

295
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,767
Is it a Hippopotamus Amphibious,
or a Rhinoceros Bihornus?

296
00:31:57,853 --> 00:32:00,417
- Professor, don't move!
- Ah, right.

297
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:01,377
Daddy?

298
00:32:04,045 --> 00:32:07,172
Daddy, what's all
the hullabaloo about? Aah!

299
00:32:10,747 --> 00:32:11,550
What is it, Daddy?

300
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:14,844
Mr Clayton asked me not to move.
He saw something.

301
00:32:17,013 --> 00:32:19,431
Oh, I moved.

302
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:22,642
Ah, Mr Clayton, sorry.
Excuse me, uh--

303
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:25,978
But my father and I came on
this expedition to study gorillas.

304
00:32:26,535 --> 00:32:29,397
I believe your shooting
might be scaring them off.

305
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:33,650
You hired me to protect you,
Miss Porter, and protect you I shall.

306
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:36,110
And you're doing
a marvellous job of it.

307
00:32:36,277 --> 00:32:39,696
We only have a short time before
the ship returns--

308
00:32:39,863 --> 00:32:43,783
Jane! Jane, do you realize
what you're standing in?

309
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:45,826
- A gorilla's nest!
- Oh, Daddy!

310
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:49,704
At last,
our first sign in days!

311
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,380
Do you think the beasts
could be nearby?

312
00:32:52,381 --> 00:32:53,149
Could be.

313
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,989
There's the evidence.
Not very far, anyway.

314
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,000
Daddy, look!
Over there and there!

315
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:01,004
Where? Oh, yes,
more nests! I see them!

316
00:33:01,171 --> 00:33:04,303
-Just as you predicted.
- Whole family groups!

317
00:33:04,304 --> 00:33:06,469
Jane, I love you!

318
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:12,471
Family groups? Excuse me,
but these are wild beasts...

319
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:14,681
that would sooner tear your head off
than look at you.

320
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:30,146
On the contrary. Daddy's theory
is that these are social creatures--

321
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:30,230
It's no gorilla.

322
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,947
- But perhaps we should press on.
- Yes, indeed.

323
00:33:37,114 --> 00:33:40,700
We should keep heading west
following the Ganoderma Ablonatum.

324
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:44,703
Excellent, Professor! I could've used
your expertise on my last safari.

325
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:55,586
Are you what all the fuss
was about?

326
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:58,713
Daddy!
Daddy, quick!

327
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:00,882
No, wait, wait.
Hold still.

328
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:02,966
Oh, my.
Oh, my good--

329
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:05,260
You may not be a gorilla,

330
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:07,511
but you are one sweet little--

331
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,558
Huh. There you go.
What do you think?

332
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,017
What? Oh!

333
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:21,522
Why, you little--

334
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:24,649
Well, this is
absolutely peachy!

335
00:34:24,816 --> 00:34:29,111
Come to study gorillas, and get
my sketchbook pinched by a baboon!

336
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,076
Give me that!

337
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:43,830
Come on now, enough of this.
I want this paper on the count of three.

338
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:47,124
One, two--

339
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:49,376
Oh, look, bananas!

340
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:54,467
I can't believe you fell for that one!

341
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:58,299
No, no, don't give me those crocodile tears.

342
00:34:58,466 --> 00:35:00,968
What would your parents have to say?

343
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:06,555
Oh! See, I told you
they'd be cross.

344
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,849
Go easy on him.
Children will be children.

345
00:35:28,447 --> 00:35:32,491
Oh! I'm flying!
What on earth am I--

346
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:38,206
Get off! Get off!

347
00:35:42,802 --> 00:35:45,501
Oh! Put me down!
Put me down!

348
00:35:46,468 --> 00:35:48,418
No! Pick me up, pick me up!

349
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:19,006
Unhand me!

350
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:39,333
Ah, over there!

351
00:37:29,324 --> 00:37:32,664
I'm in a tree with a man
who talks to monkeys.

352
00:37:32,831 --> 00:37:35,374
Ooh, I can't do this!
I can't-- Oh!

353
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:38,210
This is good.
This is... very good.

354
00:37:39,352 --> 00:37:42,546
Wait. One, two--

355
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:49,051
It can't get any worse, can it?

356
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:53,471
Obviously, it can.

357
00:37:56,098 --> 00:38:01,727
Ahh... no! Oh!

358
00:38:01,894 --> 00:38:05,855
Stay back. No, don't.
Don't come any closer. Please, don't.

359
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:08,524
What are-- What are you doing?

360
00:38:08,691 --> 00:38:11,943
Please don't.
That tickles.

361
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,694
No, get off, get off--
Get off!

362
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,019
It serves you right.

363
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,658
Stay away from me like
a very good wild man. You, stay.

364
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:23,327
I'm warning you.
My father won't take kindly to you--

365
00:38:23,493 --> 00:38:26,662
No. That's--
Now, that's close enough.

366
00:38:27,543 --> 00:38:30,538
How dare you? Wha--

367
00:39:15,866 --> 00:39:20,119
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear!

368
00:39:20,286 --> 00:39:25,123
Yes, thank you. It's a lovely heartbeat.
It's very nice.

369
00:39:26,874 --> 00:39:28,750
It's very nice.

370
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:32,233
Oh, thank you. I can't do a thing
with it in this humidity though. It's--

371
00:39:32,364 --> 00:39:34,588
You--
You do speak.

372
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:38,299
And all this time I thought you were just
a big, wild, quiet, silent person-thing.

373
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:42,510
Why didn't you tell me? I must say I'm
rather curious as to who you are. I'd love--

374
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:46,513
Tarzan.

375
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,643
Tarzan.

376
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:55,395
Tarzan.

377
00:39:59,145 --> 00:40:00,449
Oh, I see!

378
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,609
Oh, I see!

379
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,527
Tarzan.

380
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,580
Oh, I see.

381
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,155
No, no, no.
No.

382
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,624
I'm Jane.

383
00:40:12,574 --> 00:40:16,286
No, no, no. No.
I'm Jane.

384
00:40:17,203 --> 00:40:21,915
No, no.
Jane. Tarzan.

385
00:40:22,082 --> 00:40:24,417
Jane.

386
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:27,752
-Jane.
- Exactly.

387
00:40:29,282 --> 00:40:30,171
Clayton!

388
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:35,258
Clayton!

389
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:37,259
Extraordinary!

390
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:42,291
Um, please,
can you take me to my camp?

391
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:45,808
Yes! Clayton!
Wonderful!

392
00:40:46,281 --> 00:40:50,896
Um, could we--
Um, can't we walk?

393
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:53,897
Can't we walk?

394
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:57,858
- Tarzan!
- Tarzan, where are ya?

395
00:40:58,025 --> 00:41:00,902
- Tarzan!
- Let's hope we find him before Kerchak does.

396
00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:03,154
- Maybe he's lost.
- Or found something more interesting.

397
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:05,822
What, are you nuts? What could be
more interesting than us?

398
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:10,034
Hey! What's everybody lookin' at?

399
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:20,353
The horror!
It's gruesome! Hide me!

400
00:41:20,354 --> 00:41:22,835
Pull yourself together.
You're embarrassing me.

401
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,422
- These things aren't alive.
- I knew that.

402
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:30,924
- Tarzan?
- Tarzan? - Tarzan?

403
00:41:31,049 --> 00:41:32,884
Hello?

404
00:41:34,231 --> 00:41:38,680
What kind of primitive beasts
are responsible for this mess?

405
00:41:46,227 --> 00:41:49,522
Wow! Come here, you guys! Come here,
come here, come here. Look at this!

406
00:41:49,688 --> 00:41:51,940
- What is that? Funny. Wow, it's--
- What is that thing?

407
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:01,656
Hey, do it again.
Do it again.

408
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:03,853
Like this?

409
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:06,539
Yeah!

410
00:42:08,285 --> 00:42:10,124
Yeah, rip it!

411
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:13,473
I love that part!

412
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,459
Let me hear it, big fella.

413
00:42:17,942 --> 00:42:19,179
Now, hit it!

414
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,230
Yeah!

415
00:42:26,485 --> 00:42:27,133
Nice!

416
00:42:29,429 --> 00:42:31,218
What the heck?
Bye-bye.

417
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:32,052
Terk!

418
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:35,097
- Yeah, Tant?
- Hmm?

419
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:38,683
Now! Hit it!
Come on, Tantor!

420
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:42,519
Oh, I love it!

421
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:46,439
Stay with me, fellas.
I feel somethin' happenin' here.

422
00:43:20,254 --> 00:43:21,077
Yeah!

423
00:44:14,297 --> 00:44:15,601
Gorillas!

424
00:44:23,711 --> 00:44:25,429
He's one of them!

425
00:44:48,048 --> 00:44:49,489
Oh, my--

426
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:27,559
- Jane!Jane!
- Jane!

427
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:32,396
Jane, where are you?

428
00:45:32,562 --> 00:45:35,888
Jane! Oh, Jane!
Oh, thank goodness.

429
00:45:35,889 --> 00:45:37,490
Good heavens,
what happened?

430
00:45:37,524 --> 00:45:39,901
Are you all right? We've been
everywhere looking for you. I--

431
00:45:40,068 --> 00:45:43,453
Oh, my goodness! Daddy!
I was out walking.

432
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,305
- I was--
- Yes, yes.

433
00:45:45,322 --> 00:45:47,188
Little baby monkey.

434
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:48,284
- I drew a picture.
- Yes, go on.

435
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,492
- Suddenly the monkey starts crying.
- Oh, poor thing.

436
00:45:50,659 --> 00:45:53,894
- I turned 'round and there's a whole fleet of them!
- Of what?

437
00:45:53,895 --> 00:45:56,997
- There's an army of monkeys. A huge tree full of them.
- Monkeys? Monkeys!

438
00:45:57,536 --> 00:45:59,457
Screaming at me!

439
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:01,709
- That's Theripithicus Baboonus. She's very good at this.
- Oh, really?

440
00:46:01,876 --> 00:46:04,632
Terrified I was. And suddenly, I was swinging

441
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:07,388
- in the vines.
- With the monkeys, yes?

442
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:09,423
- Swinging, flying. I was in the air.
- In the air, yes, I know.

443
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:11,311
- And I'm all surrounded.
- What did you do?

444
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:13,666
Daddy, they took my boot.

445
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:15,716
They took-- Those are
the ones I bought you.

446
00:46:15,717 --> 00:46:20,811
And I was saved! I was saved
by a flying wild man in a loin cloth.

447
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:23,058
- Loin cloth? Good Lord.
- What is she talking about?

448
00:46:23,225 --> 00:46:26,519
I haven't the foggiest idea.
Takes after her mother, you know.

449
00:46:26,686 --> 00:46:29,688
She'd come up with stories like that.
Not about men in loin cloths, of course.

450
00:46:29,855 --> 00:46:31,940
- And there were gorillas.
- Gorillas?

451
00:46:32,107 --> 00:46:33,685
- They were doing--
- You saw the gorillas?

452
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:35,475
Where, Jane, where?

453
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:37,689
He left with them.

454
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,058
Who, dear, who?

455
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:41,530
Tarzan.

456
00:46:41,697 --> 00:46:45,658
- Tarzan?
- The ape man.

457
00:46:48,911 --> 00:46:51,621
Everyone, we will avoid
the strangers.

458
00:46:51,788 --> 00:46:54,379
Do not let them see you,
and do not seek them out.

459
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,705
They mean us no harm, Kerchak.

460
00:46:55,707 --> 00:46:58,668
- Tarzan, I don't know that.
- But I do. I've spent time with them.

461
00:46:58,835 --> 00:47:01,337
You may be willing to risk
our safety, but I'm not.

462
00:47:01,503 --> 00:47:04,172
Why are you threatened
by anyone different from you?

463
00:47:07,136 --> 00:47:11,469
Protect this family,
and stay away from them.

464
00:47:15,055 --> 00:47:17,265
Tarzan, for once
listen to Kerchak.

465
00:47:17,432 --> 00:47:21,143
Why didn't you tell me there were
creatures that looked like me?

466
00:47:29,024 --> 00:47:33,446
Well, he didn't stand upright,
he sort of crouched, like that.

467
00:47:33,486 --> 00:47:35,654
- Really?
- Supported his weight on his knuckles.

468
00:47:35,821 --> 00:47:37,447
- See?
- On the knuckles!

469
00:47:37,614 --> 00:47:40,310
- Exactly like a gorilla!
- Extraordinary!

470
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:42,181
It was amazing!

471
00:47:42,182 --> 00:47:45,636
And he bends his elbows out like this,
and then he walks like this.

472
00:47:45,637 --> 00:47:48,288
Oh, I see!
Like Aunt Isabel!

473
00:47:50,566 --> 00:47:51,885
<i>This is capital!</i>

474
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:54,459
Oh, Janey, Jane!
What a discovery!

475
00:47:54,626 --> 00:47:56,628
A man with no language,
no human behaviour.

476
00:47:56,794 --> 00:47:59,130
And no respect
for personal boundaries.

477
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:02,882
- How do you mean?
- He was this close, Daddy! Staring at me.

478
00:48:03,304 --> 00:48:06,218
He seemed confused
at first,

479
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:09,512
as if he's never seen
another human before.

480
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:11,972
His eyes were intense,

481
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,850
and focused and--

482
00:48:15,016 --> 00:48:19,144
I've never seen such eyes.

483
00:48:20,843 --> 00:48:21,896
Oh, shall I,
ahem,

484
00:48:22,063 --> 00:48:25,816
leave you and the blackboard
alone for a moment?

485
00:48:25,983 --> 00:48:29,819
Daddy, stop it. The point is,
think of what we could learn from him.

486
00:48:29,986 --> 00:48:32,404
<i>We must find him.</i>

487
00:48:32,921 --> 00:48:36,630
Professor, you are here
to find gorillas,

488
00:48:36,631 --> 00:48:39,223
not indulge
some girlish fantasy.

489
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:42,996
Fantasy? I didn't imagine him!
Tarzan is...

490
00:48:44,628 --> 00:48:45,653
Real.

491
00:48:45,873 --> 00:48:50,084
Ah! It's him!
It's, it's, it's him. Tarzan!

492
00:48:50,251 --> 00:48:52,086
Professor! Jane! Stand back!

493
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:54,170
No!

494
00:48:54,337 --> 00:48:56,172
<i>Clayton.</i>

495
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,175
- Clayton.
- Ahh!

496
00:49:00,342 --> 00:49:02,552
Have we... met?

497
00:49:03,835 --> 00:49:05,559
How does he
know my name?

498
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:08,264
He thinks it means
the sound of a gunshot.

499
00:49:08,431 --> 00:49:12,184
- Jane.
- Yes, hello, mmm, Tarzan.

500
00:49:12,351 --> 00:49:14,519
I see what you mean
about those personal boundaries.

501
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:18,022
What's he doing?

502
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,065
Look at him, Jane...

503
00:49:20,705 --> 00:49:22,609
Moves like an ape
but looks like a man.

504
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:25,235
He could be
the missing link!

505
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:28,640
Or our link
to the gorillas.

506
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:30,894
Ahh, yes, yes.

507
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,140
Where are the gorillas?

508
00:49:35,868 --> 00:49:38,162
Go-ril-las!

509
00:49:38,328 --> 00:49:40,371
Go-ril-las!

510
00:49:40,538 --> 00:49:43,290
Shouting won't help, Mr Clayton.
He doesn't understand English.

511
00:49:43,457 --> 00:49:45,459
Then I'll make him
understand.

512
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:48,845
If I can teach a parrot
to sing "God Save the Queen,"

513
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,549
I can certainly teach this savage
a thing or two.

514
00:49:53,631 --> 00:49:55,466
Go-rilla.

515
00:49:56,717 --> 00:49:59,719
- Go-rilla.
- Oh-ho! He's got it!

516
00:49:59,886 --> 00:50:02,972
Gorilla.
Gorilla!

517
00:50:03,138 --> 00:50:05,223
- Perhaps not.
- No, no, no, no!

518
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,226
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No, no, no. Gimme that.

519
00:50:08,392 --> 00:50:09,810
No, no.
Leave that. No.

520
00:50:09,977 --> 00:50:13,229
Mr Clayton,
I think I'll take it from here.

521
00:50:22,903 --> 00:50:24,988
<Whatever you do>

522
00:50:25,585 --> 00:50:26,891
<I'll do it too>

523
00:50:27,341 --> 00:50:30,342
<Show me everything
Tell me how>

524
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:32,635
<It all means something>

525
00:50:33,404 --> 00:50:35,648
<And yet nothing to me>

526
00:50:38,957 --> 00:50:42,501
<I can see
there's so much to learn>

527
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:46,306
<It's all so close
and yet so far>

528
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:50,534
<I see myself
as people see me>

529
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:54,802
<Oh, I just know there's
something bigger out there>

530
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,805
<I wanna know
Can you show me>

531
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:02,808
<I wanna know about
these strangers like me>

532
00:51:02,975 --> 00:51:06,769
<Tell me more
Please show me>

533
00:51:06,936 --> 00:51:10,855
<Something's familiar about
these strangers like me>

534
00:51:19,153 --> 00:51:21,530
<Every gesture>

535
00:51:21,697 --> 00:51:26,867
<Every move that she makes
makes me feel like never before>

536
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:29,202
<Why do I have>

537
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:33,330
<This growing need
to be beside her>

538
00:51:34,998 --> 00:51:38,584
<Ooo, these emotions
I never knew>

539
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:42,838
<Of some other world
far beyond this place>

540
00:51:43,004 --> 00:51:46,632
<Beyond the trees
above the clouds>

541
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:50,885
<I see before me
a new horizon>

542
00:51:51,052 --> 00:51:55,013
<I wanna know
Can you show me>

543
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:58,974
<I wanna know about
these strangers like me>

544
00:51:59,141 --> 00:52:02,977
<Tell me more
Please show me>

545
00:52:03,144 --> 00:52:06,897
<Something's familiar about
these strangers like me>

546
00:52:08,315 --> 00:52:12,151
<Come with me now
to see my world>

547
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:16,321
<Where there's beauty
beyond your dreams>

548
00:52:16,488 --> 00:52:20,407
<Can you feel the things
I feel>

549
00:52:20,574 --> 00:52:24,243
<Right now with you>

550
00:52:26,161 --> 00:52:28,663
<Take my hand>

551
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:32,416
<There's a world
I need to know>

552
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,794
We've wasted
all this time on what he wants.

553
00:52:52,931 --> 00:52:56,934
The boat could arrive any day.
Now ask him straight out.

554
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:00,910
Tarzan?

555
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,300
Will you take us
to the gorillas?

556
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:06,220
Do you understand?

557
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:08,193
I understand.

558
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:10,236
- Ooh! Good work, Jane.
- Well?

559
00:53:10,943 --> 00:53:12,112
I can't.

560
00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:14,030
- What?
- Why not, Tarzan?

561
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,111
Kerchak.

562
00:53:19,242 --> 00:53:23,204
<I wanna know
Can you show me>

563
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:27,082
<I wanna know about
these strangers like me>

564
00:53:27,248 --> 00:53:31,585
<Tell me more
Please show me>

565
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:36,088
<Something's familiar about
these strangers like me>

566
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,257
<I wanna know>

567
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:59,981
Oh, Terk, I've never
seen him so happy.

568
00:54:00,148 --> 00:54:01,899
Eh, I give it a week.

569
00:54:05,068 --> 00:54:07,320
Aye, cut her loose!

570
00:54:07,612 --> 00:54:11,156
- Arg, c'mon.
- Allright, move it, you fieldrats.

571
00:54:13,324 --> 00:54:14,617
Put your back into it.

572
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:17,452
Wait, please. Don't--
I've waited 30 years for this,

573
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:19,787
and I won't leave
until I see a gorilla.

574
00:54:19,954 --> 00:54:21,914
Oh, isn't this dreadful,
Tarzan?

575
00:54:22,081 --> 00:54:24,291
Whoa!
No, no. Wait.

576
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:30,061
You're the captain.

577
00:54:30,062 --> 00:54:33,756
Just tell them you've had engine
trouble, and give us two more days.

578
00:54:33,923 --> 00:54:36,300
And be late at every port
from here to London?

579
00:54:36,467 --> 00:54:38,301
We'll have come all this way
for nothing.

580
00:54:38,468 --> 00:54:42,388
I'm sorry, Miss Porter,
but I simply can't do it.

581
00:54:42,554 --> 00:54:44,598
Agh! This is your fault.

582
00:54:44,764 --> 00:54:47,933
I should've followed my instincts,
and set traps for the beasts.

583
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,560
Don't you think I'm disappointed
about the gorillas?

584
00:54:50,727 --> 00:54:53,604
- You are absolutely impos--
- Oh!

585
00:54:53,771 --> 00:54:57,274
Tarzan! I was so afraid
you wouldn't come in time.

586
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,817
The boat's arrived.
The boat that's come...

587
00:54:59,984 --> 00:55:02,194
to take us home
to England.

588
00:55:02,361 --> 00:55:06,405
And Daddy and I were wond--
Well, I was wondering--

589
00:55:06,572 --> 00:55:10,867
Well, we really hope that you'll
come with us. Won't you?

590
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:15,162
Go see England today,
come home tomorrow.

591
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:17,455
Oh, no.

592
00:55:17,622 --> 00:55:21,834
Well, you see, it would be
very difficult to come back... ever.

593
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,460
Not come back?

594
00:55:23,627 --> 00:55:26,629
Oh, no, no. I know it sounds awful,
but you belong with us.

595
00:55:26,796 --> 00:55:29,548
- With people.
- Jane must stay with Tarzan.

596
00:55:29,714 --> 00:55:32,633
Wh-- Stay here?
Oh, no, no. My laundry!

597
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,761
No, I can't stay.
Look, I've got--

598
00:55:36,928 --> 00:55:39,222
I've got my father
and--

599
00:55:39,388 --> 00:55:42,849
Jane, stay.

600
00:55:43,016 --> 00:55:45,685
- But--
- Please.

601
00:55:47,936 --> 00:55:50,589
But... I can't.

602
00:55:52,815 --> 00:55:54,399
Women!

603
00:55:54,566 --> 00:55:57,318
How typical!
Thank you, Jones.

604
00:55:57,485 --> 00:56:01,613
Even if you hadn't grown up a savage,
you'd be lost.

605
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:05,102
There are no trails
through a woman's heart.

606
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,029
Jane is going.

607
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:12,997
Yes. If only she could've spent
more time with the gorillas.

608
00:56:13,163 --> 00:56:15,332
She's so disappointed.

609
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:18,167
Crushed, really.

610
00:56:18,935 --> 00:56:20,727
Sorry, old boy.

611
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:24,841
Oh, well. I'd best
get Jane's things to the ship.

612
00:56:28,842 --> 00:56:31,761
Clayton!

613
00:56:31,927 --> 00:56:34,179
If Jane sees gorillas,

614
00:56:34,346 --> 00:56:36,181
she stays?

615
00:56:36,347 --> 00:56:39,558
Say, that's why she came,
isn't it?

616
00:56:42,043 --> 00:56:42,769
I'll do it.

617
00:56:43,406 --> 00:56:46,372
- Good man! Snipes?
- Sir?

618
00:56:46,385 --> 00:56:50,711
Get the boys together.
There's gonna be a change in plans.

619
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:53,068
Terk, all you have to do
is get Kerchak out of the way.

620
00:56:53,235 --> 00:56:55,070
- What?
- I'd be happy to get Kerchak--

621
00:56:55,236 --> 00:56:58,447
Shut your trunk
and get me outta here.

622
00:56:59,426 --> 00:57:02,010
Can you believe that guy?

623
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:04,660
Drops us like a newborn giraffe--
kerplop!

624
00:57:04,827 --> 00:57:07,871
Now waltzes in here
and expects us to just--

625
00:57:08,038 --> 00:57:10,844
Terk, I'm asking you
as a friend.

626
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:16,085
With the face
and the eyes, and the--

627
00:57:16,252 --> 00:57:18,128
Aah! All right!

628
00:57:18,295 --> 00:57:20,714
But don't make me do
anything embarrassing.

629
00:57:21,549 --> 00:57:23,424
I'm gonna kill him!

630
00:57:23,877 --> 00:57:26,968
A-Actually, I thought that dress
was rather slimming on you.

631
00:57:27,135 --> 00:57:29,554
Oh, really? I thought it was
a little revealing and kind of--

632
00:57:33,098 --> 00:57:35,635
How does she move in this thing?

633
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,895
Look out!

634
00:58:05,872 --> 00:58:09,375
- Oh, look, Daddy.
- Where? Wh-- Wh--

635
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:12,252
Jane!

636
00:58:12,419 --> 00:58:16,505
Be careful, Professor.

637
00:58:16,672 --> 00:58:19,716
She's beautiful.

638
00:58:19,883 --> 00:58:22,259
She's my mother.

639
00:58:22,426 --> 00:58:24,678
Th--
This is your...

640
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:28,472
mother.

641
00:58:38,104 --> 00:58:39,772
Wh-What's happening?

642
00:58:39,939 --> 00:58:41,857
I don't know,
Daddy.

643
00:58:42,024 --> 00:58:46,819
- Oh, it's getting away!
- No! You'll only frighten her more.

644
00:58:53,658 --> 00:58:57,369
Oh, yes. Absolutely, my dear.
Good idea.

645
00:58:57,536 --> 00:58:59,620
What are you doing?
Do you want to frighten them off?

646
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:01,997
Get up!
Get--

647
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:04,374
Don't get up.

648
00:59:35,821 --> 00:59:36,964
Hello.

649
00:59:41,848 --> 00:59:44,522
It's very nice
to meet you too.

650
00:59:46,489 --> 00:59:51,034
Oh, Your Majesty,
you're such a tease.

651
00:59:53,285 --> 00:59:56,621
Hello. Hello. Uh,
Archimedes Q Porter at your service.

652
00:59:56,788 --> 00:59:58,748
Aah!
Quite a grip you've got.

653
00:59:58,915 --> 01:00:01,500
Oh, thank you.

654
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:04,335
Is that one of mine?

655
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,837
Oh, this is wonderful,
Mr Clayton!

656
01:00:07,004 --> 01:00:08,547
Look! Look!
Social grooming.

657
01:00:08,713 --> 01:00:11,841
Congratulations, Professor.

658
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:15,343
Our dream has come true.

659
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:21,431
Give me that! Hey, what're you doing?

660
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:24,517
Stop that! Stop!
Hold on, now! Leave that!

661
01:00:25,294 --> 01:00:27,125
That is not
to be played with!

662
01:00:41,863 --> 01:00:44,365
- Can you teach me?
- Speak gorilla?

663
01:00:44,532 --> 01:00:46,408
Mmm, yes.

664
01:01:08,716 --> 01:01:11,260
Good heavens!
What did I say?

665
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,637
That Jane stays
with Tarzan.

666
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,807
Stay?
But I thought we'd already--

667
01:01:18,378 --> 01:01:20,725
But, Tarzan, I, I--

668
01:01:20,892 --> 01:01:23,394
Whoa! Look out!

669
01:01:25,812 --> 01:01:28,815
- Is that my dress?
- Oh, no.

670
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:35,486
Oh, Daddy.

671
01:01:35,653 --> 01:01:39,072
Give it to me!

672
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:44,243
No!

673
01:02:02,328 --> 01:02:03,323
Go!

674
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:07,635
- Wait! Wait! Tarzan!
- Go now!

675
01:02:07,802 --> 01:02:10,846
Jane, quickly!
Hurry! Come along.

676
01:02:30,795 --> 01:02:32,695
Kerchak, I didn't--

677
01:02:33,206 --> 01:02:37,115
- I'm sorry, I--
- I asked you to protect our family,

678
01:02:38,315 --> 01:02:41,143
and you betrayed us all.

679
01:03:09,515 --> 01:03:12,350
I'm so confused.

680
01:03:14,383 --> 01:03:15,768
Come with me.

681
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:19,515
There's something I should've
shown you long ago.

682
01:04:39,174 --> 01:04:40,582
Is this me?

683
01:04:44,877 --> 01:04:48,713
And this is my father,
and,

684
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,090
and my--

685
01:04:52,075 --> 01:04:53,690
Now you know.

686
01:04:54,384 --> 01:04:58,554
Tarzan, I just want you
to be happy,

687
01:04:58,721 --> 01:05:00,847
whatever you decide.

688
01:05:48,982 --> 01:05:53,261
No matter where I go,
you will always be my mother.

689
01:05:57,473 --> 01:06:01,434
And you will always
be in my heart.

690
01:06:20,658 --> 01:06:22,825
Oh, goodbye, Tarzan.

691
01:06:22,992 --> 01:06:26,327
Tarzan!
I'm so glad you found us in time.

692
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,420
Tarzan!

693
01:06:38,503 --> 01:06:42,037
We're too late!
I can't believe it!

694
01:06:42,173 --> 01:06:44,039
If you'd have pulled over
and asked for directions--

695
01:06:44,174 --> 01:06:46,415
We didn't get
to say goodbye.

696
01:06:46,551 --> 01:06:49,835
Yeah, well, good riddance!
All right? Who needs ya? Huh?

697
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:54,588
Go on, get out of here, bald boy!
You ingrate! You bald ingrate!

698
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:56,642
Go on and rot,
for all I care!

699
01:06:56,808 --> 01:06:58,685
Go!

700
01:07:00,895 --> 01:07:04,397
- What are you lookin' at?
- I'm gonna miss him too.

701
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,854
Tarzan, you can't imagine
what's in store for you.

702
01:07:15,989 --> 01:07:19,106
You're going to see the world.
Everyone's going to want to meet you.

703
01:07:19,242 --> 01:07:21,118
Kings, scientists
and famous writers.

704
01:07:21,285 --> 01:07:24,704
Yes, Darwin and Kipling.
Queen Victoria.

705
01:07:24,871 --> 01:07:26,998
I haven't met her,
but I heard she's awfully nice.

706
01:07:27,164 --> 01:07:31,042
And I'll be with Jane?

707
01:07:31,209 --> 01:07:34,795
Yes, with Jane.

708
01:07:34,962 --> 01:07:37,359
Ooh! Slippery.

709
01:07:57,644 --> 01:07:58,744
Tarzan!

710
01:08:00,468 --> 01:08:01,388
Tarzan!

711
01:08:01,523 --> 01:08:04,056
Get him!

712
01:08:04,192 --> 01:08:07,392
Get him!

713
01:08:07,528 --> 01:08:10,061
- Tarzan!
- Jane!

714
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:35,580
- What's going on here?
- Clayton. Clayton, help.

715
01:08:37,757 --> 01:08:39,349
Have we met?

716
01:08:42,554 --> 01:08:44,420
Ah, yes.

717
01:08:44,555 --> 01:08:46,421
The ape man.

718
01:08:47,273 --> 01:08:50,758
Clayton, you--
You--

719
01:08:52,478 --> 01:08:55,202
So sorry about
the rude welcome, old boy.

720
01:08:55,203 --> 01:08:57,554
But I couldn't have you
making a scene...

721
01:08:57,690 --> 01:09:01,057
when we put your furry friends
in their cages.

722
01:09:01,969 --> 01:09:04,393
- Why?
- Why?

723
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:07,353
For 300 pounds sterling
a head.

724
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:11,236
Actually, I have you
to thank, my boy.

725
01:09:11,633 --> 01:09:14,025
Couldn 't have done it
without you.

726
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:18,362
Lock him up
with the others.

727
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:24,814
Uh, that sounded
like Tarzan.

728
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,201
He sounded like,
like he was in trouble.

729
01:09:27,337 --> 01:09:31,654
Yeah, well, why doesn't he get his new
friends to help him? I don't care.

730
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,008
That's it!

731
01:09:34,342 --> 01:09:37,376
I've had it with you
and your emotional constipation!

732
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:40,503
Tarzan needs us,
and we're gonna help him!

733
01:09:40,639 --> 01:09:44,496
You got that?
Now, pipe down and hang on tight.

734
01:09:44,642 --> 01:09:46,716
We've got a boat to catch.

735
01:09:56,716 --> 01:09:59,186
I've never felt so alive!

736
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:01,727
Good!
'Cause I'm gonna kill ya!

737
01:10:02,142 --> 01:10:04,062
No time for that now,
missy.

738
01:10:24,963 --> 01:10:27,330
Tarzan, it's no use.
Don't!

739
01:10:35,343 --> 01:10:37,994
- Clayton.
- Yes, Clayton.

740
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,256
Clayton betrayed us all.

741
01:10:40,589 --> 01:10:43,508
- I'm so sorry, Tarzan.
- No.

742
01:10:43,644 --> 01:10:47,501
I did this.
I betrayed my family.

743
01:10:47,647 --> 01:10:49,513
Kerchak was right.

744
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:54,683
Oh, those magnificent creatures,
shivering in cages!

745
01:10:54,819 --> 01:10:57,352
What is this world
coming to?

746
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:05,858
Oh, by Jove,
don't know my own strength.

747
01:11:10,997 --> 01:11:12,405
What was that?

748
01:11:13,174 --> 01:11:15,282
You are an animal!

749
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:18,868
That sounded just like an elephant.

750
01:11:19,245 --> 01:11:20,332
Tantor!

751
01:11:22,548 --> 01:11:23,481
Thanks, guys.

752
01:11:23,682 --> 01:11:27,510
I thought I would never see you again,
and here you are!

753
01:11:28,607 --> 01:11:31,587
Sometimes you embarrass me.

754
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,999
Ah, I remember you.

755
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,771
I think this one
will be better off stuffed.

756
01:13:01,103 --> 01:13:03,208
Charge!

757
01:13:09,013 --> 01:13:11,973
- You came back.
- I came home.

758
01:13:26,938 --> 01:13:27,984
Fire!

759
01:13:34,771 --> 01:13:38,711
You there! Take what you can
back to the boat!

760
01:13:41,026 --> 01:13:43,142
I've got some hunting
to do.

761
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:45,228
Hey!

762
01:14:08,047 --> 01:14:08,892
Don't worry.

763
01:14:08,893 --> 01:14:11,163
I'm going to have you
out of this in a second.

764
01:14:15,801 --> 01:14:19,168
Right.
This should do the trick.

765
01:14:41,195 --> 01:14:42,894
Hiding, are we?

766
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:45,355
- Go on!
- Clayton, you--

767
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:49,024
I could use a challenge
because after I get rid of you,

768
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:53,944
rounding up your little ape family
will be all too easy!

769
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:23,154
Go ahead, shoot me.

770
01:15:26,521 --> 01:15:29,471
Be a man.

771
01:15:35,978 --> 01:15:37,583
Not a man like you!

772
01:16:08,653 --> 01:16:09,314
Clayton!

773
01:16:11,095 --> 01:16:13,660
Clayton, don't!

774
01:17:04,677 --> 01:17:06,543
Tarzan.

775
01:17:06,678 --> 01:17:09,879
Kerchak... forgive me.

776
01:17:11,449 --> 01:17:16,592
No. Forgive me
for not understanding...

777
01:17:16,728 --> 01:17:20,501
that you have always been
one of us.

778
01:17:22,398 --> 01:17:25,390
Our family
will look to you now.

779
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:29,862
No, Kerchak.

780
01:17:29,863 --> 01:17:31,065
Take care of them,

781
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:35,218
my son.

782
01:17:43,664 --> 01:17:46,865
Take care of them.

783
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:11,010
London will seem so small
compared to all this.

784
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:13,888
I will miss you,
Jane.

785
01:19:14,023 --> 01:19:17,557
- Miss Porter!
- I, I know. I'm coming.

786
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:23,226
Well, I suppose
we should say goodbye.

787
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,314
Goodbye.

788
01:19:45,838 --> 01:19:49,612
Goodbye, Tarzan!
Goodbye.

789
01:19:49,758 --> 01:19:52,527
Oh, I'm going to miss
that boy.

790
01:20:01,558 --> 01:20:05,843
Jane, dear, I can't help feeling
that you should stay.

791
01:20:05,978 --> 01:20:10,721
Daddy, please don't. We've been through
all of this. I couldn't possibly st--

792
01:20:10,857 --> 01:20:15,183
I, I belong in England with you,
with people, and-- Aah!

793
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:22,994
But you love him.

794
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,381
Go on.

795
01:20:55,265 --> 01:20:59,226
Thank you.
Thanks for getting my glove.

796
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:01,228
Thank you.

797
01:21:10,526 --> 01:21:12,986
Well--

798
01:21:16,614 --> 01:21:20,784
But, what--
What am I doing? Captain?

799
01:21:20,951 --> 01:21:23,036
Tell them that
you never found us. Eh?

800
01:21:23,202 --> 01:21:26,663
After all, people get lost
in the jungle every day. Right?

801
01:21:27,042 --> 01:21:27,788
Tootle-pip!

802
01:21:48,304 --> 01:21:52,224
<Put your faith
in what you most believe in>

803
01:21:52,391 --> 01:21:56,144
<Two worlds
One family>

804
01:21:56,310 --> 01:22:00,147
<Trust your heart
Let fate decide>

805
01:22:00,313 --> 01:22:05,025
<To guide these lives
To guide these lives we see>

806
01:22:05,192 --> 01:22:09,153
<Put your faith
in what you most believe in>

807
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,989
<Two worlds
One family>
