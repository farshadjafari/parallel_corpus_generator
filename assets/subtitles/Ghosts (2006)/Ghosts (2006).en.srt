1
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:11,025
And these are actually for sale
in the bookshops?

2
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:15,662
And in the streets as well,
Father.

3
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:20,365
- And in Toledo?
- In Toledo. In Salamanca,

4
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:22,207
Sevilla.

5
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,874
And in the Port of CÃ¡diz.

6
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:29,882
So these prints
are sent abroad?

7
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:32,219
These are sold in Rome.

8
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,673
Even as far as Mexico.

9
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:37,680
This is how the world sees us.

10
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:41,099
This,
this is how the world is seeing us.

11
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:44,185
What is the name of the artist?

12
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:46,028
Francisco Goya.

13
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:55,489
Isn't he the man you commissioned
to paint your portrait?

14
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:59,657
He is, Father.

15
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:01,668
Why did you choose him?

16
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,837
In all humility, Father,

17
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,465
I chose him for the same reason
our King and the Queen

18
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:10,762
have appointed him
to be the Court painter.

19
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:14,639
They consider him the greatest
painter in Spain.

20
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:19,013
These prints are quite disturbing,
I must say.

21
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:22,651
Disturbing?

22
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:25,735
Yes, yes, of course they are.

23
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,399
But, Father, these prints

24
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:32,905
show us
the true face of our world.

25
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,869
Maybe your world,
Brother Lorenzo.

26
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,291
How can you call
these hideous images

27
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:42,379
"the true face of our world"?

28
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,341
There is but one world, Brother,

29
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:50,172
and it is neither yours, nor mine.
It is the Lord's.

30
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:52,931
Have you lost your sight,
Brother?

31
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:56,179
Do you not see what demonic filth
and degradation

32
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:58,431
this Goya is selling?

33
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:01,730
He's an agent
of the darkest powers!

34
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:04,864
Granted that he's decorated
chapels.

35
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:07,825
He's painted angels, yes,

36
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:11,865
but when your mother raises her
eyes to pray to God

37
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,405
whom do you think she sees?

38
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:18,162
Whom do you think Goya
is using as models

39
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:20,415
for his angels?

40
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:22,967
Harlots!

41
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:27,127
Those are whores smiling down
at your mother from the ceiling!

42
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:28,972
I assert

43
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,424
before all of you

44
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:35,558
that Goya is a valuable
member of the Church.

45
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,900
How so?

46
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:41,519
Father, I have met women

47
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,109
who cannot recite
a single prayer.

48
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:45,693
It's them...

49
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:48,617
We have to seek them out,

50
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:50,696
but what is our response?

51
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:54,959
Condemn this great
Spanish artist instead?

52
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,787
Or do you think,
by burning Goya's canvases

53
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,876
the evil this artist
has depicted

54
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,962
will go up in flames?

55
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,131
Why don't we look at ourselves?

56
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:07,930
What have we accomplished

57
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,264
in the last 50 years?

58
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,394
How many heretics
have we sent to the stake?

59
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,061
I will tell you exactly how many,
Father. Eight.

60
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:18,897
Eight burned at the stake.

61
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:22,359
Are you proposing we show

62
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,195
greater severity?

63
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:29,155
Yes, Father, yes.
We have to return to the old ways.

64
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm talking about the God- fearing
ways of the past.

65
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:39,788
Are you prepared
to join this battle?

66
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:42,051
Never mind join,

67
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:45,878
grant me the wisdom to lead it,
Father.

68
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:03,867
Why doesn't that painting
have a face?

69
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:09,369
Because he's a ghost.

70
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,673
No, he is not!

71
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:19,461
Have you ever seen a ghost?

72
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:20,591
No.

73
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,966
But I have seen a witch.

74
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:26,507
- Oh, did you?
- Yes, but she had a face.

75
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,307
What did she look like?

76
00:06:30,312 --> 00:06:33,600
She was all bent and creepy,

77
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:35,900
and she stank... Phew!

78
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,864
That's interesting.
Because the witch that I know

79
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:42,866
she's young, very lovely,

80
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:45,075
and she smells of jasmine.

81
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:47,115
- She does?
- She does.

82
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:50,832
And I'm working on her portrait
right now.

83
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,759
I'm no witch!

84
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:59,334
How do you know?

85
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:24,325
Am I allowed to say something?

86
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:28,416
- Please.
- I know that face.

87
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,118
She would not be
one of your angels

88
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:33,537
in the Florida chapel, would she?

89
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:37,376
Yes, she is.
You're dangerously perceptive.

90
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:43,304
This is probably a very naive

91
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:45,635
but I am a man of the cloth.

92
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:48,229
Do you...?

93
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:55,102
Do you painters not become very
intimate with your models?

94
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:00,446
It must be very...

95
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,990
tempting...

96
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:05,289
when you spend hours
and hours alone with,

97
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,704
not only beautiful,

98
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,828
but young girl.

99
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:17,214
Would you like me to include
your hands in the portrait?

100
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:20,847
- I'll leave that up to you.
- No, it's up to you to decide.

101
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,182
Hands are not easy to paint

102
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:25,845
and not everybody will spend
the extra money.

103
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:27,517
Well, what is the difference?

104
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:31,685
One hand, two thousand reales.
Two hands, three thousand.

105
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,408
Why did you agree to paint
my portrait?

106
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,251
Why not?

107
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:49,964
You have the reputation of mocking
the men of cloth in your work.

108
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:52,249
And harshly, I must say.

109
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:54,546
Do I?

110
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:58,627
Are you aware of how many powerful
enemies you have, Goya?

111
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,685
Fortunately, I also have
a few very powerful friends.

112
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:23,705
How have you been, dear Goya?

113
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,755
- As always, Your Majesty
- So don't complain.

114
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:29,002
I endeavor not to, Your Majesty.

115
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:31,503
Is this the wild steed

116
00:09:31,677 --> 00:09:33,836
that I am to conquer today?

117
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:36,472
Oh, dear!

118
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:49,399
So how do you want me to ride?

119
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:53,689
How do you want history to perceive
you, madam?

120
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:56,282
The way I am,

121
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:58,660
young and beautiful.

122
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,795
Which one do you wish for supper,
my dear?

123
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:56,882
Maybe...

124
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:00,520
the vulture.

125
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:09,571
May I stay

126
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:12,653
and watch you work for a while?

127
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:17,327
Why, if I may have any say
in the matter, Your Majesty,

128
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:21,492
I'd prefer no- one see the work
before it's finished.

129
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,501
Am I intruding?

130
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:26,508
Yes,

131
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:29,257
you are, my dear.

132
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:35,350
Oh, I see.

133
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:39,104
As you wish,

134
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:41,937
as you will,

135
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:46,947
whatever is your pleasure.

136
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:19,726
How long do I have to sit up here?

137
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,271
For as long as I may need you there,
Your Majesty.

138
00:12:31,163 --> 00:12:33,534
See what I am carrying?

139
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:35,949
I must be a pious man, right?

140
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,079
But look at what
is really inside this.

141
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:41,874
Voltaire!

142
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:44,591
Voltaire!

143
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:48,589
The Dark Prince
of the darkest principles!

144
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:52,179
Devious. Devious.

145
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,641
Be vigilant, use your ears.

146
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:56,894
People talk.

147
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:01,314
You might hear somebody
claiming that matter

148
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,478
consists of very small elements,
called atoms.

149
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:07,736
Get his name.

150
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:08,858
He's a heretic

151
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:12,284
spreading these diabolical ideas

152
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:16,332
to poison the souls
of God- fearing people.

153
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,588
If you hear somebody talking
about 'The Temple',

154
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,339
instead of 'The Church',

155
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:28,219
he is either a Judaiser,
or, even worse, a Protestant.

156
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,475
Get his name.

157
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,472
If you are in a public place
and see a man

158
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,640
hiding his penis with his hand
while urinating

159
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,315
the man is probably circumcised.

160
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,616
And he's a Judaiser!

161
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:47,741
I am giving you
just a few examples

162
00:13:47,954 --> 00:13:51,489
of what to look for,
whom to identify.

163
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,329
Bring their names to the attention
of Holy Office.

164
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:58,041
Your eyes, your ears,
your brain.

165
00:13:58,257 --> 00:14:01,378
They are the servants of God.

166
00:14:43,347 --> 00:14:46,099
Come on, InÃ©s.
Taste it, it's good.

167
00:14:46,726 --> 00:14:48,136
Come on.

168
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,957
- Hey, where are you going?
- Oh, she's going to the dwarf.

169
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,559
What did you do?

170
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:29,188
- InÃ©s, wipe your mouth.
- No.

171
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:55,915
You have received a summons
from the Holy Office.

172
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,762
Do you have any idea
what it might be about?

173
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:02,006
No.

174
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:05,054
Where did you go with your brothers
last night?

175
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:06,763
The Tavern.

176
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:08,178
Think!

177
00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:11,014
Did you say something sacrilegious?

178
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:12,974
No.

179
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:17,733
Was there an incident
they could hold against her?

180
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:20,868
She kissed the feet of a dwarf.

181
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:22,822
- You did?
- She did.

182
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:26,206
- Everyone did!
- You know, they can summon her

183
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,040
just to testify
against someone else?

184
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,164
Someone else?

185
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:34,883
Is there someone you know
they might be interested in?

186
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:38,426
I don't know.

187
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:40,755
No!

188
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,647
Do not worry, my child.

189
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:31,151
My child.

190
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,166
In the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

191
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:32,667
Amen.

192
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,641
Sit down, please.

193
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:43,727
Are you InÃ©s Bilbatua,

194
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:46,107
begat by one
TomÃ¡s Pio Bilbatua

195
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,358
and his wife MarÃ­a Isabel?

196
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:51,856
- Yes, I am.
- We have only a few questions

197
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:54,115
and we expect you
to answer truthfully.

198
00:18:54,787 --> 00:18:56,115
I will.

199
00:18:56,371 --> 00:19:00,323
Is it true that on Wednesday,
the 16th of this month

200
00:19:00,544 --> 00:19:03,497
you dined at the inn
of Dona Julia?

201
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:06,375
Yes, it is.

202
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:11,795
What were you served that evening?

203
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:14,426
- For dinner?
- Oh, yes.

204
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:20,436
You actually want to know
what we ate?

205
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:21,810
For dinner.

206
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:29,404
I had chicken.

207
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,030
Onions,

208
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,921
chickpeas.

209
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,380
Chickpeas.

210
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:51,470
And?

211
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:54,058
Potatoes.

212
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,184
Green peppers.

213
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:03,148
Were you served pork?

214
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,313
Yes, but I didn't have any.

215
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:09,897
- Why not?
- I don't like the taste.

216
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:13,744
Are you prepared to swear
on the Holy Cross

217
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,871
that you're telling the truth?

218
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:18,701
About the pork?

219
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,036
Are you?

220
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:25,130
I swear on Jesus's sacred wounds,
I'm telling you the truth.

221
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:27,916
And I suppose
that you would not object

222
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:30,711
if we gave you an opportunity
to prove it?

223
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:33,388
No, I would be grateful.

224
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,019
How would you like me to prove it?

225
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:59,169
Did you tell us the truth?

226
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:02,002
Yes! Yes, I did!

227
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:05,834
We have reason
to suspect otherwise.

228
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,335
Why?

229
00:21:07,973 --> 00:21:11,721
We suspect the reason you avoid pork
is because you are secret Judaiser.

230
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:13,477
What?

231
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:16,308
- Are you?
- What is that?

232
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:18,981
You practice Jewish rituals.

233
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:21,479
No, I do not!

234
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,070
You have something to confess.
Do it now.

235
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:29,656
But I...
What do you want me to confess?

236
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,612
The truth.

237
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,457
But I did!

238
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,042
Tell me what the truth is!

239
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,590
Tell me what the truth is!

240
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:14,368
Hey, TomÃ¡s, how wonderful
to see you, my friend.

241
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:17,871
- How are you, Francisco?
- Come in, come in.

242
00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:24,712
- Can I offer you anything?
- No, nothing, thank you.

243
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:27,890
Are we alone?

244
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,840
Yes.

245
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:35,514
I need to speak with this man,
Francisco.

246
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:38,444
Why?

247
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:43,105
My daughter InÃ©s has been summoned
by the Holy Office.

248
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,321
- InÃ©s?
- Yes.

249
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:49,905
That's preposterous.

250
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:54,242
She went in this morning
and she hasn't come out yet.

251
00:22:54,462 --> 00:22:57,085
And we haven't heard
a word, either.

252
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:00,299
Do you know why they
wanted to talk to her?

253
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:04,298
No. That's why I would like
to speak with this man.

254
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:10,220
Francisco, I'm very sorry
to have to ask you this,

255
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:14,308
but is there any way
you can arrange it?

256
00:23:20,618 --> 00:23:24,614
But I'm in no position to curry
favors from the Inquisition...

257
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:28,364
No, no favors.
I'm simply trying to learn

258
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:32,283
if there is anything at all
I can do to help my daughter.

259
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:35,546
I wish I...

260
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:43,426
No! I cannot talk
to the Holy Office

261
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,758
about any matter

262
00:23:45,977 --> 00:23:48,432
that does not pertain directly
to me.

263
00:23:48,604 --> 00:23:49,270
I'm sorry.

264
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:52,222
I beg you, Francisco.

265
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:34,483
Father Lorenzo.

266
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,326
Come in.

267
00:26:38,915 --> 00:26:40,539
This way.

268
00:27:00,522 --> 00:27:02,809
If I were to meet this man
on the street,

269
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:05,140
I would never recognize myself
in him.

270
00:27:08,447 --> 00:27:11,733
One has such a different idea
of oneself.

271
00:27:15,662 --> 00:27:17,786
You think you might like him?

272
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:19,950
I know I like the painting of him.

273
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,952
Yes, yes...

274
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:26,916
I'm very pleased
with it, Francisco.

275
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:31,376
- Shall I choose a frame for it?
- Yes, please, do.

276
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,597
- And there's no need to send money.
- What do you mean?

277
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:38,929
- Somebody's paying for it.
- Who's paying for it?

278
00:27:39,731 --> 00:27:42,352
His name is TomÃ¡s Bilbatua.

279
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:46,728
He's a very rich merchant.

280
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:48,738
He also intends to underwrite

281
00:27:48,907 --> 00:27:52,240
the reconstruction of the Convent
of Saint TomÃ¡s.

282
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,407
He's also asked me to paint
frescos throughout the Convent,

283
00:27:56,624 --> 00:28:00,242
which is a very welcome
commission, I must admit.

284
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:03,872
- What is his name?
- Bilbatua.

285
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:07,751
What does Senor Bilbatua want
from me?

286
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,348
He's the father of...

287
00:28:13,602 --> 00:28:17,764
You recall seeing her face on the
ceiling in the Florida chapel?

288
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:19,802
Yes?

289
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:24,266
She's been arrested
by the Holy Office.

290
00:28:27,408 --> 00:28:31,026
I know him quite well.
He's a very honorable man.

291
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,758
Don't be afraid.

292
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:12,263
- InÃ©s Bilbatua?
- Yes.

293
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:23,234
I am hereto see if I can...

294
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,700
possibly be of some assistance.

295
00:30:27,914 --> 00:30:30,201
May I go home now?

296
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,245
I don't have the power
to decide that, InÃ©s.

297
00:30:34,794 --> 00:30:36,752
I wanna go home.

298
00:30:40,844 --> 00:30:42,836
Do not fear, my child.

299
00:30:48,976 --> 00:30:51,848
I can deliver a message
to your family...

300
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:53,932
Do you want me to?

301
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:55,981
Please.

302
00:30:56,485 --> 00:30:59,439
Will you tell them
that I love them?

303
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:03,612
I love them so much.

304
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:05,150
And please,

305
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:09,160
tell them that always,

306
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,117
when I shut my eyes

307
00:31:12,377 --> 00:31:14,001
and I pray to God

308
00:31:14,671 --> 00:31:17,757
I beseech Him
to let me see my mother

309
00:31:18,425 --> 00:31:20,382
and my father

310
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:22,633
and my brothers,

311
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,004
when I open my eyes...

312
00:31:27,604 --> 00:31:31,552
- Do you want me to pray with you?
- Yes, please.

313
00:31:43,037 --> 00:31:44,828
Glory to God on high.

314
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:48,244
And on earth peace
to men of good will.

315
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:52,409
We praise You, we bless You,
we adore You, we glorify You.

316
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:55,665
We give You thanks
for Your great Glory.

317
00:31:55,882 --> 00:31:59,834
O Lord God, heavenly King,
God the Father Almighty.

318
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:03,010
O Lord Jesus Christ,
the only- begotten Son.

319
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:07,142
O Lord Jesus Christ, Lord God,
Lamb of God...

320
00:32:07,603 --> 00:32:09,892
Very good, InÃ©s.

321
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:12,396
I'll take care of you.

322
00:32:12,692 --> 00:32:14,270
It's all right, it's all right.

323
00:32:23,871 --> 00:32:26,158
- Hello! Welcome.
- TomÃ¡s!

324
00:32:26,373 --> 00:32:27,998
- Gracias, Padre.
- Thank you, Jose.

325
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:31,045
- How are you, Francisco?
- I'm very well, thank you.

326
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:32,797
Father Lorenzo.

327
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:37,706
It's a great honor for me to welcome
you in my house, Father Lorenzo.

328
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:40,841
This way, please.
These are my sons.

329
00:32:41,057 --> 00:32:43,595
Ãngel... and Ãlvaro.

330
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:45,434
Hello, Ãngel.

331
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:48,435
And this is my dear wife...

332
00:32:49,898 --> 00:32:51,855
MarÃ­a Isabel.

333
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:55,570
Father Lorenzo,

334
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:57,823
welcome to our house.

335
00:32:58,034 --> 00:33:00,323
- Thank you.
- Please.

336
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,366
Francisco, thank you.

337
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,664
The time has come for me
to repay

338
00:33:06,835 --> 00:33:08,827
the Lord
for all his kindness

339
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:12,331
by restoring the Convent
of Saint TomÃ¡s.

340
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,094
You know,
TomÃ¡s being my own name,

341
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:28,183
I'm very sorry that my daughter
cannot dine with us tonight.

342
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:32,485
A most...

343
00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:36,440
a most marvelous work indeed,
Goya.

344
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,283
Thank you.

345
00:33:39,036 --> 00:33:40,115
As I was saying,

346
00:33:40,329 --> 00:33:43,995
the time has come for me to repay
the Lord for all His kindness

347
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,376
by restoring the Convent
of Saint TomÃ¡s.

348
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:54,751
Bless us, o Lord,

349
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:57,300
and your gifts,

350
00:33:57,514 --> 00:34:01,050
which from your bounty we are about
to receive through Christ our Lord.

351
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:02,549
Amen.

352
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:10,777
To the successful restoration
of the Convent of Saint TomÃ¡s.

353
00:34:16,785 --> 00:34:18,578
This wine is excellent.

354
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:22,120
It was aged on a ship that has gone
twice around the world.

355
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:25,373
It takes constant motion

356
00:34:25,544 --> 00:34:27,620
to bring out the flavor
in this particular wine.

357
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:29,874
I didn't know that.

358
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,880
And these are anchovies
from SantoÃ±a.

359
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:37,974
I presume that you're anxious
to have some news of your daughter.

360
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:39,547
Oh, yes,

361
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:41,601
extremely so.

362
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:45,265
She has never ever been away.
Did you see her?

363
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:47,275
Yes, I did.

364
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,443
How is she?

365
00:34:50,073 --> 00:34:52,525
She's in fine spirits

366
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:55,024
and sends her love
to all of you.

367
00:34:57,121 --> 00:34:58,862
When can we expect her home?

368
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:03,366
I couldn't say.
She must first stand trial.

369
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:04,866
Stand trial?

370
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:08,665
Why?

371
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:10,880
For what she has confessed.

372
00:35:11,552 --> 00:35:13,842
What did she confess?

373
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,006
That she had secretly practiced

374
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:19,177
the Jewish rituals
of her forbears.

375
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:21,851
But that's impossible.

376
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:26,564
We are an old Christian family.

377
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:29,650
Correct me if I'm wrong

378
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,950
but the Brothers in charge
of the archives...

379
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:36,077
informed me that your
grandmother's great- grandfather

380
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:40,574
converted from Judaism to
Christianity when he came to Spain

381
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:42,666
from Amsterdam in 1624.

382
00:35:45,215 --> 00:35:47,172
Is that true?

383
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:48,625
Yes.

384
00:35:51,765 --> 00:35:54,881
But I am the only person
in the family who knows that.

385
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:58,180
Then why has your daughter
confessed to it?

386
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,854
InÃ©s couldn't possibly confess to
something she has no knowledge of.

387
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:04,396
Excuse me,

388
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:07,404
was my sister put
to 'The Question'?

389
00:36:07,823 --> 00:36:09,448
Yes, she was.

390
00:36:10,493 --> 00:36:12,616
My daughter was tortured?

391
00:36:13,911 --> 00:36:16,036
She was put to 'The Question'.

392
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:18,407
I thought that kind
of 'investigation'

393
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,625
had been abandoned years ago.

394
00:36:21,254 --> 00:36:23,542
Yes, it was,

395
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:27,712
but now
in these troubled times,

396
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:31,511
in its quest for the truth,
the Church is bringing it back.

397
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,004
So...

398
00:36:33,476 --> 00:36:37,342
you maintain that a confession
obtained by the means of

399
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:41,512
as you call it 'The Question'
is valid proof of anything?

400
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:46,355
This is not an opinion
of one simple monk, sir.

401
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:49,444
It is a tenet of Church
teaching that a confession

402
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,490
attained by 'The Question'
constitutes ultimate proof.

403
00:36:54,831 --> 00:36:57,156
I'm sorry, Lorenzo,

404
00:36:57,375 --> 00:37:00,495
but how can this sort
of confession be an ultimate proof?

405
00:37:00,712 --> 00:37:04,082
If I were tortured, I'd confess
to anything.

406
00:37:04,301 --> 00:37:07,420
I'd confess
I was the Turkish sultan.

407
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:09,216
No, you wouldn't.

408
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:11,630
I would confess to anything
to avoid pain.

409
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:14,091
No, you wouldn't.

410
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:16,933
You're a God- fearing man, Goya,
aren't you?

411
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:20,565
Of course I am.

412
00:37:20,778 --> 00:37:24,145
So, your fear of God would prevent
you from making a false confession.

413
00:37:24,988 --> 00:37:27,658
But what ifthe pain obscured
my senses?

414
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:31,405
What if my fear of pain
became bigger

415
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:33,490
than my fear of God?

416
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:37,242
If you are innocent of the charge,
God will give you the strength

417
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:39,418
to withstand the pain.

418
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,085
- Are you sure of that?
- Yes.

419
00:37:42,424 --> 00:37:44,500
Forgive me, Father Lorenzo,

420
00:37:44,718 --> 00:37:48,669
but have you ever been
put to the...

421
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:51,512
to 'The Question' yourself?

422
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:55,468
- Have I ever been?
- Yes.

423
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:59,308
Have you ever been subjected
to 'The Question'?

424
00:37:59,526 --> 00:38:01,103
Of course not.

425
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:03,943
Do you think that if you were

426
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,445
and they asked you to confess

427
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,774
something grotesquely absurd,

428
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:10,819
say...

429
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:15,202
say you were told to confess that
you are really a monke...

430
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,625
are you sure that God

431
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,292
would grant you the fortitude
to deny it?

432
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:26,179
Or would you rather confess
to being a monkey

433
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,054
to avoid the pain?

434
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,842
I know I would.

435
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:34,010
I know you would.
So would I.

436
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:37,850
Would you?

437
00:38:41,573 --> 00:38:45,439
What is this? Are you playing some
sort of silly game with your guest?

438
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:49,492
Nobody would ever ask Father Lorenzo
to confess something so absurd.

439
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:52,164
I would.

440
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:12,679
- Is he serious?
- Oh, I'm sure he's not.

441
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:16,602
Ãlvaro, go get your father.

442
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,690
Sometimes I don't understand
his humor.

443
00:39:23,743 --> 00:39:25,734
Nobody does.

444
00:39:25,953 --> 00:39:28,408
Because my father doesn't have
a sense of humor.

445
00:39:28,747 --> 00:39:31,748
Oh, yes, he does.

446
00:39:33,503 --> 00:39:36,125
- More wine?
- No, thank you.

447
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:37,745
Francisco?

448
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:49,181
"I, Lorenzo Casamares,

449
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:53,763
hereby confess that, contrary
to my human appearance,

450
00:39:54,235 --> 00:39:55,777
am, in fact,

451
00:39:55,945 --> 00:39:58,979
the bastard son of a chimpanzee
and an orangutan

452
00:39:59,907 --> 00:40:03,274
and I have schemed
to join the Church in order

453
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:06,661
to do harm to the Holy Office."

454
00:40:22,597 --> 00:40:24,342
Sign it.

455
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:31,100
This is a joke, TomÃ¡s, right?

456
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:34,901
Sign it.

457
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:44,325
Ãngel, block the door.

458
00:40:49,462 --> 00:40:52,166
Francisco, escort me out
of this house.

459
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:54,209
Stop Senor Goya.

460
00:40:57,176 --> 00:41:01,127
- Are you crazy?
- Francisco, please stay out of this.

461
00:41:01,347 --> 00:41:03,672
- Let us go.
- You can go.

462
00:41:03,891 --> 00:41:07,059
What do you mean I can go?
And Father Lorenzo?

463
00:41:07,689 --> 00:41:09,977
Did he let my daughter go?

464
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:14,648
Did you let my innocent daughter
go?

465
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:18,447
Did he?

466
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:21,989
Keep him here.
Let Senor Goya go.

467
00:41:25,418 --> 00:41:27,291
Release him!

468
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,162
Escort SeÃ±or Goya out.

469
00:41:30,379 --> 00:41:32,004
TomÃ¡s!

470
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,209
Take your hands off me!
This is outrageous.

471
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:38,552
Are you ready to sign
the confession?

472
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:01,326
MarÃ­a Isabel.

473
00:42:14,095 --> 00:42:16,217
Bring him here.

474
00:42:19,724 --> 00:42:21,351
Sign it.

475
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:33,102
Tie his hands.

476
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,902
Will you sign?

477
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:47,872
All right.

478
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:50,213
Let's find out if God will give
you the strength

479
00:42:50,383 --> 00:42:52,378
to resist 'The Question'.

480
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,594
Lift him up.

481
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:46,941
I will burn this paper

482
00:43:47,153 --> 00:43:50,237
the moment
my daughter returns home.

483
00:43:50,446 --> 00:43:52,738
But I won't wait forever.

484
00:43:53,702 --> 00:43:55,991
You must understand that.

485
00:43:56,204 --> 00:43:58,827
All right, you are free to go now.

486
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:14,716
Father Lorenzo?

487
00:44:15,184 --> 00:44:16,559
You're forgetting something.

488
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:23,851
This might be of great help
to both of us.

489
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:40,539
This is a very generous
contribution, indeed.

490
00:44:42,296 --> 00:44:45,795
We are grateful for your efforts,

491
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:47,674
Brother Lorenzo.

492
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,508
There is a request, Father.

493
00:44:52,432 --> 00:44:54,591
There usually is.

494
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:58,096
Let us hear the particulars.

495
00:44:58,564 --> 00:45:00,189
The merchant

496
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,933
would like
to have his daughter back.

497
00:45:03,527 --> 00:45:06,896
- Is she with us?
- Yes, Father. Yes.

498
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:11,201
- What is her status?
- A Judaiser.

499
00:45:13,871 --> 00:45:16,828
How did you respond
to this request?

500
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,413
I promised
to plead for her release.

501
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:25,872
- On what grounds?
- I took into consideration...

502
00:45:28,013 --> 00:45:30,968
the size of the endowment as well
as the fact

503
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:33,423
that she is very young.

504
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:36,803
Did she confess?

505
00:45:37,022 --> 00:45:38,645
Yes, Father.

506
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:41,896
She was put to 'The Question'.

507
00:45:44,905 --> 00:45:48,191
We shall accept
this magnanimous gift

508
00:45:48,409 --> 00:45:50,650
with humble gratitude.

509
00:45:52,705 --> 00:45:55,993
We shall also carve the name
of the donor

510
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,829
in the Convent in stone
to commemorate

511
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,336
his generosity forever.

512
00:46:04,174 --> 00:46:06,466
As for the daughter,

513
00:46:07,054 --> 00:46:11,005
I will pray to the Lord He may
bestow His mercy on her.

514
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:14,686
Of course, releasing her would
contradict

515
00:46:15,563 --> 00:46:18,234
the basic principles
of our faith,

516
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,850
because it would suggest
that the Church

517
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,394
doubts the power
of 'The Question'.

518
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,901
We are concluded.

519
00:46:39,882 --> 00:46:42,835
- Did you see my parents?
Yes, I did, I did.

520
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:46,002
They are doing everything
they can to get you out.

521
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:47,253
And?

522
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,631
And...

523
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:55,893
they love you very much, InÃ©s.

524
00:46:59,404 --> 00:47:01,443
Shall we pray together, InÃ©s?

525
00:47:32,107 --> 00:47:34,393
I can't believe it.

526
00:47:34,941 --> 00:47:38,145
"I am, in fact,
the bastard son

527
00:47:38,362 --> 00:47:41,528
of a chimpanzee
and an orangutan...

528
00:47:42,742 --> 00:47:45,363
Can you believe this idiot?

529
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,245
He's crazy.

530
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,625
Your Majesty,

531
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:55,619
I am a desperate father

532
00:47:55,924 --> 00:47:59,873
and this was done only to prove
that, if put to 'The Question'

533
00:48:00,302 --> 00:48:02,260
even the most innocent man
of cloth

534
00:48:03,015 --> 00:48:06,179
will confess to the most
preposterous absurdities.

535
00:48:09,937 --> 00:48:11,135
Yes.

536
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:14,357
We beg you, Your Majesty,
please use your authority

537
00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:17,603
to restore our daughter to us.

538
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,814
Yes,
I will see what I can do for her.

539
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:26,159
I had a good look at the signature.

540
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:31,123
- There can be no mistake?
- It is Lorenzo's.

541
00:48:33,548 --> 00:48:35,503
Where is Brother Lorenzo?

542
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:38,171
All the brothers are looking
for him, Father).

543
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:44,847
- Yes?
- Francisco Goya y Lucientes?

544
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,341
At your service.

545
00:48:47,938 --> 00:48:49,977
We have been told
that you are painting

546
00:48:50,148 --> 00:48:52,023
a portrait
of Lorenzo Casamares.

547
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:54,689
Yes, please come in.

548
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:57,277
It's already finished.
This way.

549
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:59,364
I hope Father Lorenzo

550
00:48:59,534 --> 00:49:02,107
is pleased with the frame
we've chosen for it.

551
00:49:06,206 --> 00:49:08,876
Lorenzo Casamares
disgraced himself

552
00:49:09,043 --> 00:49:10,702
and he is now a fugitive.

553
00:49:11,546 --> 00:49:13,171
A fugitive?

554
00:49:13,382 --> 00:49:14,661
I see.

555
00:49:14,882 --> 00:49:17,503
We're here to confiscate
the portrait.

556
00:49:19,681 --> 00:49:21,637
Yes, of course.

557
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:25,680
If he were to contact you,

558
00:49:25,853 --> 00:49:28,227
we would like
to be notified immediately.

559
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,064
Well, certainly.

560
00:49:33,946 --> 00:49:35,438
Oh, incidentally,

561
00:49:38,616 --> 00:49:41,901
I have not yet been paid
for the painting.

562
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,408
If we find him,
we'll remind him.

563
00:50:27,587 --> 00:50:30,208
As the image of the man

564
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:32,838
vanishes into thin air...

565
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:37,465
may his name forever vanish

566
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:40,130
from all memory.

567
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:43,221
Whosoever pronounces his name

568
00:50:44,898 --> 00:50:47,520
may he burn in the fires

569
00:50:47,693 --> 00:50:50,183
of eternal damnation.

570
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:36,405
She will like this frame.
You've done beautiful work.

571
00:51:37,203 --> 00:51:40,157
I've never been this close
to our Queen.

572
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:44,201
But... is she really that ugly?

573
00:51:45,295 --> 00:51:48,083
What's your point?
It's a beautiful painting.

574
00:51:48,299 --> 00:51:51,917
Yes, but that does not make
a Queen beautiful.

575
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:47,980
Don Francisco,

576
00:52:48,573 --> 00:52:51,859
Her Majesty wishes for you
to go to His Majesty's chamber.

577
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:09,547
Please, sit.

578
00:53:12,683 --> 00:53:14,638
Sit, please.

579
00:53:15,351 --> 00:53:17,476
Please, sit

580
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:16,496
How did you like it?

581
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:19,797
Very much, Your Majesty.
Very much.

582
00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:24,539
- Are you telling me the truth?
- I am, I am. I was very...

583
00:54:25,135 --> 00:54:27,175
moved, Your Majesty.

584
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:28,463
Not now.

585
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:30,965
Do you know
who composed that piece?

586
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:34,551
No, not really, sire.

587
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,439
Mozart, maybe? No.

588
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,736
HÃ¤ndel?

589
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,153
- I did.
- Really?

590
00:54:50,539 --> 00:54:52,615
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

591
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:55,205
Excellent and beautifully
performed. performed.

592
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,960
- So much for art.
- Now, sire,

593
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,344
I wonder if I could have
your opinion on my...

594
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,214
All right, come in.

595
00:55:12,644 --> 00:55:15,930
Your Majesty...
I have come from Paris.

596
00:55:17,149 --> 00:55:18,941
The French rabble

597
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:22,321
has decapitated the King
of France.

598
00:55:23,072 --> 00:55:25,530
The King of France?

599
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:28,027
Yes, Your Majesty.
King Louis.

600
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:31,366
He was guillotined
in a public execution

601
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,871
six days ago.

602
00:55:34,377 --> 00:55:36,335
My cousin Louis?

603
00:55:36,838 --> 00:55:38,464
Yes, sire.

604
00:56:04,786 --> 00:56:06,066
15 YEARS LATER

605
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:09,615
Our soldiers must comprehend
the noble purpose of their mission.

606
00:56:09,792 --> 00:56:12,992
They carry a personal message
from me, Napoleon Bonaparte,

607
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:16,627
that I will not stand by
and watch our Spanish neighbors

608
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:19,082
continue to suffer the tyranny

609
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,336
of corrupt and decadent kings,

610
00:56:21,554 --> 00:56:24,672
repressive clergy
and foreign imposters.

611
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,976
Yes, the King of Spain
is not even Spanish.

612
00:56:28,186 --> 00:56:30,392
He is French.
And the Queen of Spain...

613
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:32,977
She is Italian!

614
00:56:33,567 --> 00:56:36,650
No wonder the Spanish people
hate the Royal Family

615
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:39,817
as much as they hate
the Inquisition.

616
00:56:40,867 --> 00:56:43,154
You have never fought

617
00:56:43,327 --> 00:56:45,485
an easier campaign, soldiers!

618
00:56:46,372 --> 00:56:50,453
The common folk will greet you
with flowers and kisses

619
00:56:50,668 --> 00:56:52,957
on the streets of Madrid!

620
00:56:53,172 --> 00:56:56,836
The Spaniard cannot wait
to break his chains

621
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:00,334
and become a free man.

622
00:57:00,553 --> 00:57:02,512
Long live Napoleon.

623
00:58:09,795 --> 00:58:13,744
I can see these explosions
but I can't hear them.

624
00:58:14,883 --> 00:58:16,508
I'm deaf.

625
00:58:17,011 --> 00:58:20,963
I am completely deaf now,
but every morning

626
00:58:21,183 --> 00:58:25,016
I thank the Lord that
He hasn't taken my sight away

627
00:58:25,228 --> 00:58:27,268
that I've been able to witness

628
00:58:27,899 --> 00:58:31,183
and record
what has been happening here.

629
00:58:36,867 --> 00:58:39,156
These are French soldiers.

630
00:58:39,577 --> 00:58:41,073
The Mamelukes.

631
00:58:41,289 --> 00:58:44,739
Special cavalry recruited
from Egypt by Napoleon

632
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,831
to help liberate Spain.

633
00:58:47,585 --> 00:58:51,536
To bring us the noble ideas
of the French Revolution.

634
00:58:52,551 --> 00:58:54,045
Liberty,

635
00:58:54,262 --> 00:58:55,423
equality,

636
00:58:55,637 --> 00:58:56,882
brotherhood.

637
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,594
Then to defend the ideas
of the Revolution

638
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:05,181
Napoleon, this scourge of royalty,

639
00:59:05,398 --> 00:59:09,348
made his own brother,
Joseph, the King of Spain.

640
00:59:10,028 --> 00:59:11,772
But to my fellow Spaniard,

641
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:15,897
Napoleon's armies are nothing
but foreign invaders,

642
00:59:16,785 --> 00:59:18,066
occupiers.

643
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:39,923
Who is in command
of this place?

644
00:59:43,272 --> 00:59:44,979
God

645
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,598
is in command of this

646
00:59:48,276 --> 00:59:52,109
and every other place
on this earth, my son.

647
00:59:53,785 --> 00:59:57,200
- In the name of Emperor Napoleon...
- Continue.

648
00:59:57,412 --> 00:59:59,701
...and by the letter
of the Rights...

649
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:15,130
Brother? Brother?

650
01:00:15,347 --> 01:00:17,970
Brothers, give him air,
let him breathe here.

651
01:00:20,431 --> 01:00:23,384
In the name of Emperor Napoleon
and by the letter

652
01:00:23,601 --> 01:00:27,432
of the Declaration of the Rights
of Man and of the Citizen,

653
01:00:27,646 --> 01:00:31,598
we hereby proclaim
the Spanish Inquisition abolished.

654
01:00:32,111 --> 01:00:34,945
All of its properties confiscated

655
01:00:35,155 --> 01:00:39,104
and all of its prisoners
will be freed forthwith.

656
01:03:43,401 --> 01:03:45,525
Now, go away.

657
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,521
I'm deaf.

658
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:51,364
I'm deaf!

659
01:04:03,338 --> 01:04:05,628
Sit down. Sit down.

660
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,134
You have to write,
write everything down.

661
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,806
Write what happened,
I can't hear.

662
01:04:18,979 --> 01:04:20,094
Are you hungry?

663
01:04:21,442 --> 01:04:23,731
Are you hungry?

664
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,201
I confessed,

665
01:04:33,288 --> 01:04:36,242
and they said I would be tried,

666
01:04:36,917 --> 01:04:39,206
but there was never a trial.

667
01:04:40,672 --> 01:04:42,960
My father is dead now.

668
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:47,089
My whole family is dead.

669
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:58,762
The only thing I can think
about is my child.

670
01:04:59,775 --> 01:05:01,732
You had a child?

671
01:05:02,236 --> 01:05:03,860
In prison?

672
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:13,741
My daughter, my little girl.

673
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:16,368
I need to see her.

674
01:05:16,586 --> 01:05:18,663
I need to take care of her.

675
01:05:18,838 --> 01:05:21,624
Can you help me find her?
Please?

676
01:05:30,057 --> 01:05:32,299
InÃ©s, look at me.

677
01:05:32,518 --> 01:05:35,639
Swear to God Almighty
you're telling the truth.

678
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:44,905
I need to talk to somebody
from the Holy Office.

679
01:05:45,115 --> 01:05:47,738
But the Holy Office is long gone.

680
01:05:49,953 --> 01:05:52,907
- But they're not all dead, are they?
- They might as well be.

681
01:05:53,124 --> 01:05:55,745
They're either all in prison
or on the run.

682
01:05:59,882 --> 01:06:02,716
- Who's running the prison?
- The French.

683
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:04,635
And Napoleon has sent

684
01:06:04,804 --> 01:06:07,212
a special prosecutor along
with his army.

685
01:06:11,019 --> 01:06:13,890
Will he receive me?
Where would I find him?

686
01:06:20,611 --> 01:06:22,852
Stay here. Watch her.

687
01:06:23,073 --> 01:06:24,697
Felipe!

688
01:06:42,594 --> 01:06:43,709
Silence!

689
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:49,010
Silence!

690
01:06:55,483 --> 01:06:57,107
Quiet!

691
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,200
I am here

692
01:07:12,377 --> 01:07:16,541
to serve the ideas of the
great French Revolution!

693
01:07:26,101 --> 01:07:28,091
They opened my eyes,

694
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:31,597
as they are opening the eyes
of the blind all over the world,

695
01:07:31,815 --> 01:07:34,435
because they are irresistible.

696
01:07:35,486 --> 01:07:38,107
They are logical, they are just.

697
01:07:38,406 --> 01:07:40,112
Universal.

698
01:07:47,415 --> 01:07:52,041
All men, all men are born free.

699
01:07:53,004 --> 01:07:56,420
All possess the same rights,
and those...

700
01:07:57,133 --> 01:07:59,920
...those who refuse
to see the light of liberty

701
01:08:00,095 --> 01:08:01,923
shall receive no mercy.

702
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,012
There will be...

703
01:08:04,641 --> 01:08:08,770
there will be no liberty
for the enemies of liberty!

704
01:08:17,196 --> 01:08:18,905
Father Gregorio...

705
01:08:22,451 --> 01:08:26,071
do not take this personally
However...

706
01:08:27,209 --> 01:08:29,450
However you are

707
01:08:29,628 --> 01:08:31,086
the very incarnation

708
01:08:31,254 --> 01:08:33,581
of blind fanaticism and nepotism.

709
01:08:34,549 --> 01:08:37,087
You are the tool by the means
of which few

710
01:08:37,302 --> 01:08:40,588
have kept the many in chains.

711
01:08:40,805 --> 01:08:44,971
You exemplify the very worst aspect
of Spain

712
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:48,471
and so you will be judged
for your deeds.

713
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:59,693
By... By the unanimous decision
of the judges...

714
01:09:01,496 --> 01:09:04,780
and by the power vested in them
by the Declaration

715
01:09:04,998 --> 01:09:08,285
of the Rights of Man
and of the Citizen,

716
01:09:08,503 --> 01:09:10,129
this court

717
01:09:10,338 --> 01:09:12,165
sentences you...

718
01:09:14,218 --> 01:09:15,677
to death.

719
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,781
Do you remember
that rich merchant

720
01:09:40,954 --> 01:09:43,445
that made you confess that you...

721
01:09:49,088 --> 01:09:50,371
Yes.

722
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:55,462
- You remember.
- SÃ­. What was his name?

723
01:09:55,762 --> 01:09:57,339
TomÃ¡s Bilbatua.

724
01:09:57,555 --> 01:10:00,638
Yes, of course. How is he?

725
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,561
Oh, he's dead.

726
01:10:03,146 --> 01:10:06,181
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- No, it's his daughter.

727
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:11,276
She needs help.

728
01:10:11,695 --> 01:10:14,151
Of course. She can come
to see me any time she wants.

729
01:10:14,365 --> 01:10:17,154
Well, she's here.
She's in my carriage outside.

730
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:19,327
Bring her in.

731
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,870
I owe everything...

732
01:10:28,756 --> 01:10:32,706
- I owe everything to...
- No, you don't have to shout.

733
01:10:33,137 --> 01:10:35,425
You can just speak slowly

734
01:10:35,638 --> 01:10:38,592
and articulate
and I can read your lips.

735
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,810
I owe everything to that man.

736
01:10:45,023 --> 01:10:48,606
Because of him I had
to run to France.

737
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:51,276
And there suddenly,

738
01:10:51,449 --> 01:10:53,774
saw in one bright flash

739
01:10:53,992 --> 01:10:57,609
how terribly wrong I had been
all my life.

740
01:10:58,079 --> 01:10:59,360
Reading...

741
01:10:59,581 --> 01:11:02,073
Reading Voltaire, Rousseau...

742
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,955
Meeting Danton. Look,

743
01:11:05,172 --> 01:11:07,295
I was baptized again.

744
01:11:07,757 --> 01:11:10,045
I shed blood
for the Revolution.

745
01:11:10,259 --> 01:11:14,091
- A nasty wound.
- And I even got married there.

746
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:16,928
Yes, Henrietta, my wife.

747
01:11:17,852 --> 01:11:20,473
I love her...
And I have three children.

748
01:11:21,272 --> 01:11:24,358
Yes, I who took the vows
of celibacy.

749
01:11:25,901 --> 01:11:28,937
So you will have to paint
my portrait

750
01:11:29,113 --> 01:11:31,188
with the whole family.

751
01:11:31,657 --> 01:11:32,938
That's...

752
01:11:33,702 --> 01:11:36,324
That's ten hands to paint.

753
01:11:36,996 --> 01:11:40,617
Ten.
And I can afford them all now.

754
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:42,960
Come in.

755
01:11:46,172 --> 01:11:47,455
InÃ©s.

756
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:52,133
- This is Lorenzo...
- Casamares.

757
01:11:52,347 --> 01:11:54,424
Lorenzo Casamares.

758
01:11:56,268 --> 01:11:58,140
What can I do for you, miss?

759
01:11:59,145 --> 01:12:01,766
Don't, no, no, please, stop this,
stop.

760
01:12:02,147 --> 01:12:04,108
Stop, please.

761
01:12:05,027 --> 01:12:06,653
Sit down.

762
01:12:08,322 --> 01:12:09,603
Sit.

763
01:12:10,324 --> 01:12:12,282
Just tell me

764
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,946
what do you need?
What can I do for you?

765
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:19,994
What happened to our child?

766
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:23,499
- I beg your pardon?
- Is she...?

767
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:26,963
Is she with you?

768
01:12:36,354 --> 01:12:39,639
How long did they keep you
in that prison?

769
01:12:40,858 --> 01:12:43,314
I don't know.

770
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:45,892
And...

771
01:12:47,698 --> 01:12:50,534
you think you had a child
in there?

772
01:12:50,743 --> 01:12:52,701
A little girl.

773
01:12:53,289 --> 01:12:56,039
- Our daughter
- "Our" daughter?

774
01:13:00,837 --> 01:13:04,253
Why do you believe that I am
the father of your little girl?

775
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:07,802
Because you're

776
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:10,544
the only man I've ever known.

777
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:13,971
Please, sit down,
sit down, please.

778
01:13:23,654 --> 01:13:25,860
What happened to the child?

779
01:13:26,074 --> 01:13:28,029
I don't know.

780
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,990
They took her from me

781
01:13:31,204 --> 01:13:32,484
before...

782
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:36,413
she even tasted my milk.

783
01:14:00,693 --> 01:14:02,651
InÃ©s, my dear, come here.

784
01:14:02,944 --> 01:14:04,570
Come, come.

785
01:14:06,785 --> 01:14:08,494
Now,

786
01:14:08,703 --> 01:14:11,823
you will go
with this nice young man

787
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,746
and he will take you
to your daughter.

788
01:14:14,959 --> 01:14:16,584
All right?

789
01:14:17,295 --> 01:14:19,919
You just go with him.

790
01:14:20,592 --> 01:14:24,209
Go on.
Everything will be fine.

791
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:37,356
I feel...

792
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:42,145
such pity for these poor souls.

793
01:14:44,325 --> 01:14:46,532
How barbaric we were...

794
01:14:46,702 --> 01:14:48,779
Where are you sending her?

795
01:14:49,163 --> 01:14:52,117
She has obviously taken leave
of her senses in jail.

796
01:14:54,587 --> 01:14:58,535
However, I will not fail her.
I promise you.

797
01:14:58,755 --> 01:15:01,591
- Will she be all right?
- She will be well provided for.

798
01:15:01,801 --> 01:15:05,169
You think she invented the story
about her child?

799
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:10,721
I'm afraid so.
I'm sure she did.

800
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,648
Tell me...

801
01:15:15,524 --> 01:15:17,647
if a prisoner gave birth

802
01:15:17,818 --> 01:15:19,812
in the dungeons
of the Holy Office,

803
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:23,902
what would have happened
to the child?

804
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:29,245
Might it concern

805
01:15:30,582 --> 01:15:32,541
your child?

806
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:34,949
Please,

807
01:15:36,173 --> 01:15:38,629
respond to my question.

808
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:40,925
If I do,

809
01:15:41,677 --> 01:15:45,511
will you spare whatever remains
of my life?

810
01:15:45,725 --> 01:15:48,679
Will you kindly let me die
in peace?

811
01:15:50,772 --> 01:15:52,480
Yes.

812
01:15:54,691 --> 01:15:58,193
Can I trust a... a monkey?

813
01:16:03,244 --> 01:16:04,700
Yes.

814
01:16:09,085 --> 01:16:12,582
There are no girls here born in '93
and brought from Madrid?

815
01:16:13,462 --> 01:16:15,421
Are there?

816
01:16:18,009 --> 01:16:21,630
There was one who would answer
that description.

817
01:16:24,726 --> 01:16:26,635
1793, Madrid,

818
01:16:26,812 --> 01:16:29,431
sent here
by the Holy Office.

819
01:16:29,646 --> 01:16:31,104
Which one is she?

820
01:16:31,313 --> 01:16:33,059
She's not here.

821
01:16:33,234 --> 01:16:35,642
She ran away from us
when she was only 11.

822
01:16:36,445 --> 01:16:38,404
Where is she now?

823
01:16:38,615 --> 01:16:41,071
Only God can answer
that question.

824
01:16:41,284 --> 01:16:43,739
She was a little tiger.

825
01:16:47,168 --> 01:16:49,621
Is it known
who her parents were?

826
01:16:52,298 --> 01:16:53,922
Not really.

827
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:00,008
Did they mention their names?

828
01:17:00,722 --> 01:17:03,676
Oh, no. They never do.

829
01:17:06,061 --> 01:17:08,850
- Did you baptize her?
- Oh, immediately.

830
01:17:09,066 --> 01:17:11,355
What was her baptismal name?

831
01:17:11,818 --> 01:17:12,683
Alicia.

832
01:17:13,402 --> 01:17:14,731
Alicia.

833
01:17:15,154 --> 01:17:16,436
Alicia.

834
01:17:17,616 --> 01:17:19,240
Come on.

835
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:00,994
Come on.

836
01:18:13,301 --> 01:18:17,003
- Who was that girl there?
- Her name is Alicia. She's sweet...

837
01:18:17,221 --> 01:18:19,891
- What's her name?
- Alicia.

838
01:18:20,099 --> 01:18:22,058
Write it down.

839
01:18:22,896 --> 01:18:24,521
Alicia.

840
01:18:24,732 --> 01:18:26,557
All right. Alicia.

841
01:18:26,774 --> 01:18:29,729
- Will she be back?
- Oh, no, no, not today. Tomorrow.

842
01:18:29,944 --> 01:18:32,813
- What?
- You can have her tomorrow.

843
01:18:36,576 --> 01:18:39,743
My God, what is this?

844
01:18:40,581 --> 01:18:42,907
This is by the Flemish painter
Hieronymous Bosch...

845
01:18:43,458 --> 01:18:44,999
El Bosco, sire.

846
01:18:45,168 --> 01:18:47,411
It's called
'The Garden of Earthly Delights'.

847
01:18:47,922 --> 01:18:49,998
- Do you like this?
- Well,

848
01:18:50,215 --> 01:18:54,132
it is very bizarre, you are right,
but of course it's Flemish.

849
01:18:54,346 --> 01:18:56,967
And it is very well painted.

850
01:18:57,391 --> 01:19:00,347
This is neither my kind of a garden
nor my kind of delights.

851
01:19:01,271 --> 01:19:03,510
I would never send this
to Napoleon.

852
01:19:03,729 --> 01:19:06,601
This is not my brother's taste...
No!

853
01:19:06,817 --> 01:19:08,808
You can keep this thing right
here in Madrid.

854
01:19:13,491 --> 01:19:16,362
Ah, now this looks promising.

855
01:19:16,579 --> 01:19:18,985
This is Carlos the Fourth.

856
01:19:19,206 --> 01:19:22,243
I met him... and his wife.

857
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:24,916
Although I don't recall her being
that ugly.

858
01:19:25,713 --> 01:19:28,668
How did she manage
to have so many lovers?

859
01:19:28,883 --> 01:19:31,505
She was the Queen, sire.

860
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:36,428
This... is a masterpiece.

861
01:19:36,642 --> 01:19:40,142
- Indeed it is, sire.
- My brother would appreciate this.

862
01:19:41,313 --> 01:19:43,722
And he can just do that?

863
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:47,524
Take paintings from the Royal gallery
and pack them off to Paris?

864
01:19:47,737 --> 01:19:50,820
We have to express our gratitude
for what Napoleon did for freedom

865
01:19:51,032 --> 01:19:54,401
in Spain somehow darling. Yes?

866
01:19:55,872 --> 01:19:58,658
Senor Francisco de Goya
is here to see you, sir.

867
01:19:58,874 --> 01:20:00,832
- Bring him in.
- Wait!

868
01:20:05,338 --> 01:20:08,956
Show Senor Goya to my study
and kindly ask him to wait.

869
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:11,006
Thank you.

870
01:20:22,481 --> 01:20:24,771
I'm sorry, Francisco.

871
01:20:24,944 --> 01:20:27,102
At lunch I'm a family man.

872
01:20:27,822 --> 01:20:30,444
- May I offer you something to drink?
- No, thank you, no.

873
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:33,409
I just want to get in touch
with InÃ©s Bilbatua.

874
01:20:34,244 --> 01:20:35,954
Why?

875
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:38,947
Well, she was telling the truth.

876
01:20:39,165 --> 01:20:41,789
She does have a daughter.

877
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:44,254
How do you know?

878
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:47,502
- I saw her.
- You saw her?

879
01:20:48,303 --> 01:20:49,583
Yes.

880
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:52,427
Did you talk to her?

881
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,598
No, no, I just saw her.

882
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:58,889
How do you know that the girl
you saw is InÃ©s's daughter?

883
01:21:00,649 --> 01:21:02,773
She looked exactly
like her mother did

884
01:21:02,943 --> 01:21:04,935
when I painted her 16 years ago.

885
01:21:05,153 --> 01:21:09,104
- She was, it was a perfect replica.
- Where did you see her?

886
01:21:13,456 --> 01:21:15,946
In the Pardo Gardens.

887
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:20,080
- In the Gardens?
- Yes.

888
01:21:21,629 --> 01:21:23,586
She is a...?

889
01:21:25,677 --> 01:21:27,753
Yes, she is.

890
01:21:28,972 --> 01:21:30,930
Do you know her name?

891
01:21:32,226 --> 01:21:33,933
- Alicia.
- Alicia.

892
01:21:34,142 --> 01:21:37,429
Do you think you could bring InÃ©s
to my house?

893
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:40,851
I want the mother
to meet her daughter.

894
01:21:41,108 --> 01:21:42,390
Of course.

895
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:47,489
Come on.

896
01:22:06,052 --> 01:22:08,971
- Is your name Alicia?
- Yes.

897
01:22:11,183 --> 01:22:13,805
Where were you born, Alicia?

898
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:16,685
In an orphanage.

899
01:22:17,106 --> 01:22:19,728
Do you know
who your parents were?

900
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:23,060
My mother was a heretic.

901
01:22:37,294 --> 01:22:39,418
So, where do you wanna do it?

902
01:22:39,589 --> 01:22:40,704
Right here?

903
01:22:40,923 --> 01:22:44,175
Nowhere.
I just want to talk to you.

904
01:22:45,472 --> 01:22:47,677
You're not the police, are you?

905
01:22:50,687 --> 01:22:53,306
I would like to make you
a proposition.

906
01:22:54,605 --> 01:22:57,143
- All right.
- Leave Spain.

907
01:22:57,359 --> 01:22:59,233
- Leave Spain?
- Yes.

908
01:22:59,443 --> 01:23:01,070
- And go where?
- America.

909
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:02,824
With you?

910
01:23:03,032 --> 01:23:05,071
No, but...

911
01:23:05,701 --> 01:23:07,658
if you leave Spain,

912
01:23:08,371 --> 01:23:11,820
I will provide you with enough money
that you will never want for...

913
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,413
No, no, please let me out of the...

914
01:23:14,628 --> 01:23:16,668
- Now, please, stop this...!
- Wait, calm down. Let me speak.

915
01:23:16,881 --> 01:23:19,287
I'm not gonna end up
in some brothel or harem?

916
01:23:19,508 --> 01:23:20,836
Let me speak.

917
01:23:21,051 --> 01:23:24,254
- Let go of me, or I'll scream.
- Wait, stay here.

918
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:26,679
Wait... Quiet, quiet.

919
01:23:27,058 --> 01:23:31,137
Quiet, quiet. Let me speak.
Quiet! Wait!

920
01:23:31,521 --> 01:23:33,395
Alicia, come back!

921
01:23:34,984 --> 01:23:37,936
Even if this Alicia actually
were InÃ©s's daughter,

922
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:40,941
which I doubt, which I doubt...

923
01:23:42,908 --> 01:23:44,866
If she were,

924
01:23:45,328 --> 01:23:48,613
I would never want to bring
those two together.

925
01:23:48,914 --> 01:23:50,538
Why not?

926
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:52,707
For me,
the idea of telling a mother:

927
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,042
"I found your daughter
and she's a whore"

928
01:23:55,213 --> 01:23:57,205
is unthinkable and cruel.

929
01:23:58,257 --> 01:24:00,714
I could never bring myself
to do it.

930
01:24:00,886 --> 01:24:03,176
But they're the same flesh
and blood.

931
01:24:03,391 --> 01:24:05,216
Plus, Francisco,

932
01:24:06,934 --> 01:24:10,930
InÃ©s is not in control
of her senses.

933
01:24:13,941 --> 01:24:17,109
- Where is she?
- She's in very good hands.

934
01:24:17,321 --> 01:24:19,563
Where?
I need to talk to her.

935
01:24:19,739 --> 01:24:21,863
Why is she so important to you?

936
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:25,944
You are completely obsessed
with her.

937
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:29,288
You yourself noticed her.

938
01:24:29,501 --> 01:24:33,202
That face is...
engraved on my mind.

939
01:24:34,047 --> 01:24:37,082
She's the angel descending
from heaven in 'La Florida'.

940
01:24:37,299 --> 01:24:40,966
I see her in taverns, I see her
in the streets, in my dreams.

941
01:24:41,638 --> 01:24:45,174
I saw her face when I thought
I was dying in CÃ¡diz.

942
01:24:45,393 --> 01:24:47,515
And I didn't do anything for her
when she needed it.

943
01:24:47,729 --> 01:24:50,016
I'm not going
to abandon her again!

944
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:52,520
Can you understand that?

945
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,317
Where is she?

946
01:25:00,327 --> 01:25:01,606
Francisco,

947
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:07,530
that poor woman
has lost her mind.

948
01:25:10,211 --> 01:25:12,002
I said where is she?

949
01:25:15,383 --> 01:25:18,469
- I don't care who you are.
- I'm painter to the King!

950
01:25:19,179 --> 01:25:22,798
To which King? Do you know how
many kings I have in here?

951
01:25:23,518 --> 01:25:26,635
I even have two Napoleons.
And one of them is an Arab.

952
01:25:26,853 --> 01:25:29,856
The other one is seven foot,
two inches tall.

953
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,727
- Is he deaf?
- Yeah.

954
01:25:34,488 --> 01:25:37,441
Painter to the King.
He could be blind.

955
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:40,774
So, who is this woman anyway?

956
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,193
InÃ©s Bilbatua.

957
01:25:45,666 --> 01:25:47,908
How much is she worth to you?

958
01:25:49,837 --> 01:25:53,787
- How much is she worth to you?
- One thousand reales.

959
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,589
1,000? 100!

960
01:25:57,137 --> 01:25:59,010
100!

961
01:25:59,223 --> 01:26:03,220
You must be crazy! And take it
as a professional opinion!

962
01:26:03,436 --> 01:26:06,603
There are revolutions everywhere,
the world is going to hell.

963
01:26:06,815 --> 01:26:08,770
The British have landed
in Portugal

964
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,732
and I am responsible
for this hospital.

965
01:26:10,943 --> 01:26:14,607
And you have the audacity
to offer me 100?

966
01:26:14,822 --> 01:26:16,779
500. 500.

967
01:26:16,993 --> 01:26:19,946
- 200.
- All right.

968
01:26:21,121 --> 01:26:23,410
Is there anybody else here
that he wants?

969
01:26:45,104 --> 01:26:46,564
InÃ©s.

970
01:26:49,486 --> 01:26:52,106
Oh, no... Not again.

971
01:26:52,821 --> 01:26:56,690
You cannot carry a baby
all your life. No woman can.

972
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,036
No, MarÃ­a, no!

973
01:27:02,707 --> 01:27:04,083
- Stop it!
- InÃ©s!

974
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:05,954
Hold her.

975
01:27:06,171 --> 01:27:07,915
Get her! Stop it!

976
01:27:08,132 --> 01:27:10,337
Stop it. Let her go!

977
01:27:10,549 --> 01:27:13,300
- InÃ©s, calm down.
- InÃ©s!

978
01:27:13,636 --> 01:27:15,592
InÃ©s!

979
01:27:19,268 --> 01:27:21,307
Don't you remember me?

980
01:27:24,815 --> 01:27:25,895
You can go home now.

981
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:30,269
I found your daughter, InÃ©s.

982
01:27:31,616 --> 01:27:32,896
See,

983
01:27:33,074 --> 01:27:35,910
you have to go.
He has found your daughter.

984
01:27:38,497 --> 01:27:40,702
- My daughter?
- Yes.

985
01:27:41,915 --> 01:27:43,411
My baby?

986
01:27:57,309 --> 01:27:58,588
Halt!

987
01:28:03,107 --> 01:28:06,727
What's happening here?
Why can't we go through?

988
01:28:10,155 --> 01:28:12,113
You can't go there.

989
01:28:12,741 --> 01:28:14,699
InÃ©s, wait in the carriage.

990
01:28:15,994 --> 01:28:18,284
You keep an eye on her.

991
01:29:35,499 --> 01:29:37,207
Miss Alicia?

992
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,537
Yes.

993
01:29:41,504 --> 01:29:43,461
I'm Francisco Goya.

994
01:29:44,633 --> 01:29:46,923
I'm painter to the King.

995
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,633
Is that your child?

996
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,049
No.

997
01:29:55,979 --> 01:29:59,264
I want you to come
with me and meet somebody.

998
01:29:59,691 --> 01:30:01,767
Another man?

999
01:30:02,527 --> 01:30:04,272
No.

1000
01:30:05,364 --> 01:30:07,024
I understand.

1001
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:09,449
No, I'm not talking about...

1002
01:30:09,661 --> 01:30:11,901
I want you to meet somebody
to whom you are very important.

1003
01:30:12,121 --> 01:30:12,985
Who?

1004
01:30:20,422 --> 01:30:21,798
Alicia,

1005
01:30:22,008 --> 01:30:24,499
you've never met your mother,
have you?

1006
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:27,292
And?

1007
01:30:47,618 --> 01:30:48,897
Alicia!

1008
01:30:50,287 --> 01:30:52,245
Alicia, run!

1009
01:30:55,793 --> 01:30:57,751
No, don't touch her!

1010
01:30:58,922 --> 01:31:00,630
Alicia!

1011
01:31:46,431 --> 01:31:48,720
- Where is she?
- She went that way.

1012
01:31:48,933 --> 01:31:51,722
But didn't I tell you...!
Go find her!

1013
01:31:51,938 --> 01:31:54,476
I said Don Francisco wants you
to stay here.

1014
01:31:54,691 --> 01:31:57,016
Bring her home! Bring her home!

1015
01:33:00,054 --> 01:33:01,678
Bring him in.

1016
01:33:10,273 --> 01:33:13,559
- Did you decree that deportation?
- Yes.

1017
01:33:15,528 --> 01:33:18,483
So you're sending all these girls
to America

1018
01:33:19,033 --> 01:33:21,604
just to get your poor harlot
daughter out of the way?

1019
01:33:21,826 --> 01:33:25,659
This is the best thing for those
women, it's the best thing.

1020
01:33:25,832 --> 01:33:27,787
What are you saying?
Say it again.

1021
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,958
It is a new life for them.
It is a new life.

1022
01:33:30,962 --> 01:33:33,962
A new life? To be sold
as slaves in America?

1023
01:33:34,173 --> 01:33:37,674
It is better than living
in this whorehouse called Spain.

1024
01:33:37,888 --> 01:33:41,053
- What are you saying?
- Wake up, Francisco.

1025
01:33:41,264 --> 01:33:44,136
The Spanish people couldn't care
less about ideals.

1026
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:47,768
Spain today
is one big whorehouse.

1027
01:33:48,647 --> 01:33:49,893
Whore?

1028
01:33:52,235 --> 01:33:54,524
Are you calling me a whore?

1029
01:33:54,946 --> 01:33:57,734
You have the audacity
to call me a whore?

1030
01:33:57,948 --> 01:34:00,571
And what are you? Look at you!

1031
01:34:00,869 --> 01:34:02,778
Look what you are today.

1032
01:34:02,995 --> 01:34:05,203
But do you remember
what you were yesterday?

1033
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,578
Who's the whore here?

1034
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:12,626
Don't lecture me, Francisco.

1035
01:34:13,467 --> 01:34:17,379
Do not lecture me.
At least I tried to do something

1036
01:34:17,594 --> 01:34:19,671
- and believed in what I was doing.
- Wait.

1037
01:34:19,888 --> 01:34:21,715
- I am a believer, Francisco.
- Wait.

1038
01:34:21,932 --> 01:34:24,888
I am a believer...! But you?

1039
01:34:25,521 --> 01:34:27,478
Look at you.

1040
01:34:28,398 --> 01:34:31,269
You work for anyone
who pays.

1041
01:34:31,485 --> 01:34:33,478
Yesterday the King of Spain.

1042
01:34:33,696 --> 01:34:36,269
Today the French.
Tomorrow?

1043
01:34:36,449 --> 01:34:38,858
Probably that bastard Wellington!

1044
01:34:39,078 --> 01:34:41,366
- No!
- Yes, Francisco.

1045
01:34:41,872 --> 01:34:44,494
You only believe in money.

1046
01:34:45,708 --> 01:34:47,251
You are the whore.

1047
01:34:51,798 --> 01:34:53,508
What is it?

1048
01:35:02,686 --> 01:35:05,472
The King has just received news

1049
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:09,525
that the British have crossed
the border from Portugal to Spain

1050
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:11,444
and are advancing.

1051
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:16,074
According to a reliable source,
they are not meeting any resistance

1052
01:35:16,282 --> 01:35:20,234
and the Spanish are joining them
in their assault on our outposts.

1053
01:35:21,121 --> 01:35:22,948
What are the King's orders?

1054
01:35:23,164 --> 01:35:26,584
The King and his family left
for Madrid half an hour ago.

1055
01:35:29,215 --> 01:35:32,584
- And Madrid?
- News hasn't reached the city yet.

1056
01:36:33,368 --> 01:36:35,076
InÃ©s.

1057
01:36:38,915 --> 01:36:41,040
I want her to sleep.

1058
01:36:41,211 --> 01:36:43,203
Her father has not seen her yet.

1059
01:36:43,963 --> 01:36:47,580
Oh, I don't want her to be crying
when she sees him.

1060
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:45,852
Wait!

1061
01:37:55,705 --> 01:37:56,988
Halt!

1062
01:37:59,836 --> 01:38:02,327
Back to France, you cowards!

1063
01:39:00,235 --> 01:39:01,515
FranÃ§oise?

1064
01:39:53,668 --> 01:39:55,292
Brother Lorenzo,

1065
01:39:56,170 --> 01:39:59,789
I hope you will understand there
is nothing personal

1066
01:40:00,092 --> 01:40:01,207
in our judgment.

1067
01:40:01,384 --> 01:40:02,380
However,

1068
01:40:03,303 --> 01:40:05,510
you became

1069
01:40:05,681 --> 01:40:08,598
the living embodiment
of diabolical ideas.

1070
01:40:11,353 --> 01:40:14,639
You proclaimed that Man
is higher than God

1071
01:40:15,442 --> 01:40:19,143
and that the words of the Gospels
are nothing but lies and poison.

1072
01:40:21,655 --> 01:40:23,613
You must never

1073
01:40:23,991 --> 01:40:27,194
never be allowed
to repeat your crimes.

1074
01:40:28,037 --> 01:40:31,041
Therefore,
the Church declares you guilty,

1075
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:34,664
and your punishment
will be death.

1076
01:40:36,005 --> 01:40:39,291
But if you repent publicly,

1077
01:40:39,508 --> 01:40:42,214
the merciful hand
of the Church

1078
01:40:42,429 --> 01:40:44,055
will spare your life.

1079
01:40:47,727 --> 01:40:50,681
Your body will be saved,
and even your soul,

1080
01:40:50,898 --> 01:40:52,604
if you join us again

1081
01:40:52,772 --> 01:40:55,182
in the ever- loving arms
of God.

1082
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:00,561
Lorenzo,

1083
01:41:01,408 --> 01:41:03,115
my son,

1084
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:13,499
will you repent?

1085
01:41:53,589 --> 01:41:55,332
No, I'm sure.

1086
01:42:24,038 --> 01:42:26,495
- In the name of the Father...
- God will forgive your sins.

1087
01:42:26,707 --> 01:42:29,874
You have lost your sight, Brother.
Open your eyes.

1088
01:42:30,754 --> 01:42:32,333
Lorenzo!

1089
01:42:32,548 --> 01:42:33,663
Lorenzo!

1090
01:42:34,259 --> 01:42:37,093
Lorenzo! Over here!

1091
01:42:37,554 --> 01:42:39,879
Well, what do you think's going
to happen to him now?

1092
01:42:40,098 --> 01:42:44,144
Brother, repent. You still have
time to plead for God's mercy.

1093
01:42:44,353 --> 01:42:46,312
Repent. Repent.

1094
01:43:02,622 --> 01:43:06,241
Come back to us, and God
will receive you into His arms.

1095
01:43:08,045 --> 01:43:09,161
Open your eyes!

1096
01:43:17,181 --> 01:43:19,469
Repent.
God will forgive your sins

1097
01:43:19,642 --> 01:43:21,801
if you repent now! Repent...

1098
01:43:26,565 --> 01:43:27,893
Oh God.

1099
01:43:28,567 --> 01:43:31,189
Or you'll be damned
for all eternity.

1100
01:43:31,611 --> 01:43:35,231
God will forgive your sins.
You have lost your sight, Brother.

1101
01:43:35,574 --> 01:43:38,326
You still have time to plead
for God's mercy.

1102
01:43:38,537 --> 01:43:41,076
For God is all merciful.
