1
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,965
I'm home

2
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,031
I should've listened to you
and taken my umbrella

3
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,332
I'm soaking wet

4
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:29,241
So I called him outside on his
lunch break and I told him,

5
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:32,781
"There's lots of guys waiting
to take your place"

6
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:36,054
Right at the busiest time
of the lunch hour,

7
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,885
he was just spacing out
in the kitchen

8
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,055
He's totally not helpful

9
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,759
Who does he think runs that place?

10
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,661
What?

11
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,498
I think he's 3 years younger than me

12
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:58,668
That's right, he's an only child

13
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:02,305
His parents totally spoiled him
Unbelievable

14
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:05,509
Well, who cares about him anyway

15
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,789
What do you think?
It's so late already

16
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,229
Skip the bath tonight?

17
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,382
Nozomi...
You're beautiful

18
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,661
Nozomi...

19
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,201
Welcome

20
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:42,471
Welcome
Yes, just a moment

21
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,110
Welcome

22
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,312
It's so cold

23
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,317
You're beautiful today, too

24
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,528
I'm off

25
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:54,362
Beau-ti-ful

26
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:19,894
Beau-ti-ful

27
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:42,918
AIR DOLL

28
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,682
Moe! Hey, wait!

29
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,212
I forgot

30
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:22,153
Off you go!

31
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:23,849
I'm off!

32
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,385
I'm off...

33
00:10:57,756 --> 00:11:01,750
Burnable
Burnable

34
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:02,994
Burnable...

35
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,995
Not burnable

36
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,428
Burnable

37
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,366
Burnable, not burnable

38
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,836
Kishida! The stickers!

39
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,838
Thank you

40
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,509
Not burnable

41
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,249
Not burnable
Burnable

42
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,009
Burnable...

43
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,730
Thank you

44
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,500
Thank you

45
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:01,744
Do you remember when
that family

46
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,414
was murdered in that
upper-class neighborhood?

47
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,585
It says here it happened
on the 20th of last month

48
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,395
A judge and his wife

49
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,296
and their daughter, a pianist

50
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,734
Each of them murdered in
their sleep, late at night

51
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:21,838
The murderer was already arrested

52
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,969
He was a failed student

53
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:27,073
Her parents wouldn't let him
date their daughter

54
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:43,126
"Don't copy me

55
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:47,688
"Mr. Echo

56
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:49,994
"Mr. Copycat"

57
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:52,761
Cold!

58
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:06,414
Come here

59
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:08,817
Rio!

60
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:14,154
Yuzu! Yuzuki!
Come here

61
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:16,856
Haruna!
Come!

62
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:18,087
Yuuki!

63
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:43,831
Cinema Circus
Video Rental Shop

64
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:46,736
Are you looking for something?

65
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:53,605
Help Wanted

66
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:09,719
Here we are!

67
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,960
This hill!

68
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,432
Pretending to go straight!

69
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,844
It warmed you up

70
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:44,715
I found myself with a heart...

71
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:52,353
With a heart I was not
supposed to have

72
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:07,636
Movies are made with film

73
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,578
Light passes through it
and on to a screen

74
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,141
Film

75
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:17,419
Right
You never watched a movie?

76
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:24,727
That's just a substitute. You have to
watch movies in a movie theater

77
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,728
Movie... theater?

78
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,866
Kids these days are unbelievable

79
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,403
What have you seen
at a theater recently?

80
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,801
Me?

81
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,036
You know...

82
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,105
There's this one or...

83
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,646
But you can't beat

84
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,711
"Battles Without Honor
and Humanity"

85
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,015
"Battles Without Honor
and Humanity..."

86
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:58,426
Battles...

87
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,227
Without...

88
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,140
Don't worry, don't worry

89
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,644
It'll be fine. Don't worry
about what your boss told you

90
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,710
I don't see you that way at all

91
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,713
So don't you worry

92
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:25,318
I can't believe they keep

93
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:28,290
that useless guy in charge

94
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,487
What are they thinking?
Right, exactly

95
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,761
Thank you very much

96
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,234
Thank you...

97
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:58,384
What are you looking for?

98
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,221
What?

99
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,221
What?

100
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,332
Wasn't "Battles" great?

101
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:17,942
"I've still got bullets left,
Yamamori san"

102
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,641
Didn't you watch Part 1?

103
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:26,317
Part 2 is "Hiroshima"
Want to rent both?

104
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,115
What are you doing
for Christmas, Nozomi?

105
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:36,555
With your boyfriend?

106
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,563
Your boyfriend,
your favorite guy

107
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,737
You have one, right?

108
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:48,971
No

109
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,535
Really?

110
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,403
Yes

111
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,940
The first time

112
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:03,180
I asked my wife out
to a movie "Love Story"

113
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:07,583
I told a lie

114
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:13,357
Because I found a heart,
I told a lie

115
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,936
"Planet of the Apes"

116
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,173
"Purple Noon"

117
00:22:24,308 --> 00:22:27,106
Chaplin's "The Great Dictator"

118
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,106
Junichi likes musicals

119
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:36,482
Musicals are fun movies
with singing and dancing

120
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:42,387
"There's Something About Mary"
is supposed to be really funny

121
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,798
The water's just right

122
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:09,980
You've got to get all the way in

123
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,480
Your only flaw is that
your body's so cold

124
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:24,522
Can you tell?

125
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:28,888
Smells great
It's a popular shampoo

126
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,866
I spent 100 Yen more than
the usual shampoo

127
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,970
100 Yen makes a big difference

128
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:43,137
Great...

129
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:23,442
Lucky you
You don't age

130
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:28,982
I... found a white hair
down there

131
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,223
What a shock

132
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,259
I wonder how much longer
I can make love with you

133
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,150
So damned pretty

134
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,756
The Winter Triangle

135
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,961
Don't make me repeat myself

136
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,728
Can't you ever remember?

137
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,803
There's Sirius

138
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,338
And Procyon

139
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,509
And Betelgeuse

140
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:29,049
That's not true
You're beautiful, too

141
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:34,991
No point being jealous
of the stars

142
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:03,019
I am an air doll

143
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:08,015
A substitute for handling
sexual desire

144
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:13,457
Nozomi...
Always stay beside me

145
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,738
Do you like it?

146
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,932
What is up there?

147
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:45,546
Up in the sky, there's air
And clouds float there

148
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:49,942
At night, the moon
and the stars come out

149
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:55,487
It's invisible so you can't see it
But it's there

150
00:29:56,193 --> 00:29:59,721
You can't see it
But it's there

151
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:02,990
Hard to understand

152
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:17,276
Is that the ocean?

153
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:20,784
Yes, that's right

154
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,614
Have you never seen the ocean?

155
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,020
No

156
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,155
There's so many boats

157
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,909
What does it mean
"To get old"?

158
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:57,144
It means aging and getting
closer to death

159
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,347
Death?

160
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,719
Yes

161
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,227
Losing life

162
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,159
Life...

163
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,926
Even here, you can
smell the sea

164
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,740
This smell reminds me
of my childhood

165
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:28,746
Reminds me, too...

166
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,709
You can eat your broccoli

167
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,607
Aren't you going to eat?

168
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:35,746
No

169
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,528
Moe, that's not a comb

170
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,993
But Ariel was doing it

171
00:32:54,404 --> 00:32:56,134
Who?

172
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,834
A-ri-el

173
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,273
Ariel...
Right, she was

174
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,647
You don't know, Daddy
I saw it with Mommy

175
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,088
Excuse me

176
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,420
A beer

177
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,393
And also,
what I asked for before

178
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,123
Yes, sir

179
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,898
Hey, you ate your carrot?

180
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,904
Yeah

181
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:32,833
You can eat the rest then

182
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:54,096
Hey, what happened?

183
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,221
A blackout?

184
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,731
Is it a blackout?

185
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:11,972
What?

186
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,311
A birthday

187
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,215
A birthday?

188
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,887
They're celebrating the day
she was born into this world

189
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:32,827
Look, a present from your mom

190
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:36,306
Blow them out

191
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:49,275
Does everybody have one?
A birthday?

192
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,952
What's that?

193
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,856
White clover

194
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,036
White clover...
White clover...

195
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,382
That's a dandelion

196
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:25,050
Is this about to be born, now?

197
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:26,817
No, it's already wilted

198
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,489
Poor thing

199
00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:34,255
But it has to die someday

200
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,496
Otherwise the world
would be overrun

201
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,902
Hard to understand

202
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:44,023
What else do you
want to know?

203
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,983
I want to know
more about you

204
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,557
"Candy..."

205
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,932
"5,980 Yen"

206
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,132
I'm home

207
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,579
Were you lonely?

208
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:18,610
Okabe suddenly
took the day off

209
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:22,385
What's he thinking...

210
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,463
I'm an air doll

211
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,896
A late model, cheap one...

212
00:39:58,161 --> 00:40:01,028
A girl called Ari or Mari
or something,

213
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:05,101
is combing her hair with a fork,
like this...

214
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:11,534
You don't know?

215
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,210
No...

216
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:19,146
That must be "The Little Mermaid"
It's over here

217
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,047
You have it
Thanks

218
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:24,715
I'm sorry...

219
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:30,784
A movie with a super-bad cop in it

220
00:40:30,894 --> 00:40:35,855
Like a totally corrupt cop, making
bad drug deals, rotten to the core

221
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,224
Rotten?

222
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,494
Yeah, got anything?

223
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,331
Then, how about,

224
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,702
"Bad Lieutenant", Abel Ferrara

225
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:44,934
Is it really bad?

226
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,010
It's more than bad
Harvey Keitel is the worst

227
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,043
The worst...

228
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,376
Why don't you rent
"Donnie Brasco", too?

229
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:53,608
Al Pacino plays a guy in the mafia

230
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,547
- And Johnny Depp is a cop?
- Yeah

231
00:40:55,652 --> 00:40:57,813
- I already saw it
- You did

232
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,222
Excuse me...

233
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:08,527
You can wipe them off with this

234
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,460
The lines

235
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,634
Lines?

236
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:27,077
Lines?

237
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,077
"Dreams?"

238
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,052
"Dream..."

239
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,385
"Dream?"

240
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:36,423
OK, how about Theo Angelopoulos'

241
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:38,885
"The Beekeeper"

242
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,425
Gelo?

243
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,998
Angelo...

244
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,556
Across the river there's
a big DVD store

245
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,697
You can't rent "Dream of Light"
You have to buy it

246
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:54,206
"The Beekeeper" comes in a box set,

247
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:57,336
so you probably can't rent it,
even there

248
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,184
Thanks

249
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:07,317
Across the river...

250
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,751
Thank you

251
00:42:12,762 --> 00:42:14,320
I'm sorry...

252
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:18,032
I am useless...

253
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,637
What's your name?

254
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:33,780
Look at the flowers

255
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,876
What's the flower called?

256
00:42:40,056 --> 00:42:41,648
Excuse me

257
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,985
I'm sorry

258
00:42:46,496 --> 00:42:47,987
I'm sorry

259
00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:56,396
I'm sorry

260
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,940
Excuse me

261
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:27,860
Say, do you know a bug
called the mayfly?

262
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,509
The mayfly...

263
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:37,369
Dies a day or 2
after it gives birth

264
00:43:37,914 --> 00:43:40,815
So its body is empty

265
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,784
No stomach or intestines

266
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:48,748
It's filled with eggs instead

267
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:53,795
It's a creature that's born
only to give birth

268
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,858
Humans aren't so different

269
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,202
Pointless...

270
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:08,576
I'm empty, too...

271
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:17,148
A marvelous coincidence
I'm the same...

272
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,351
I'm all empty

273
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,795
I wonder if there are others

274
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:32,965
These days, everybody is

275
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,367
Everybody?

276
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:37,132
Yes, especially,

277
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:41,509
everyone living in this kind of city

278
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,282
You're not the only one

279
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:58,188
Say, do you know this poem?

280
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:01,123
Poem?

281
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:04,231
You don't know poems?

282
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,257
Doesn't matter,

283
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:09,528
"Life is..."

284
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:12,331
Life is...

285
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:16,878
Let's see, "life is..."

286
00:45:18,347 --> 00:45:21,215
Let's see, life is?

287
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:01,117
It seems life

288
00:46:01,224 --> 00:46:05,594
is constructed in a way

289
00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:08,255
that no one can fulfill it alone

290
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:16,505
Just as

291
00:46:16,806 --> 00:46:20,106
it's not enough for flowers

292
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,405
to have pistils and stamens

293
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,579
An insect or a breeze

294
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:28,809
must introduce a pistil to a stamen

295
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:39,922
Life contains its own absence,

296
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,996
which only an Other can fulfill

297
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:55,570
It seems the world
is the summation of Others

298
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,780
And yet,

299
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:02,608
We neither know nor are told

300
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,849
that we will fulfill each other

301
00:47:08,057 --> 00:47:11,289
We lead our scattered lives,

302
00:47:11,394 --> 00:47:14,887
perfectly unaware of each other...

303
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:20,300
Welcome, would you like
to buy a cake?

304
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,634
The master has come home

305
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:26,572
Welcome back, Master

306
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:31,478
Or at times, allowed to find

307
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,614
the Other's presence disagreeable

308
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:41,353
Why is it,

309
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:46,952
that the world is constructed
so loosely?

310
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:51,733
I'm Misato

311
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,927
How old are you, Misato?

312
00:47:54,036 --> 00:47:54,936
I'm 24

313
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,402
24...

314
00:47:56,505 --> 00:47:59,942
Misato, do you know
a good restaurant nearby?

315
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,601
I just started yesterday

316
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:03,043
I understand

317
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,135
What do you like?

318
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,407
I like pasta

319
00:48:05,514 --> 00:48:07,244
I like pasta, too!

320
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,985
I want Extra Rice

321
00:48:10,086 --> 00:48:12,146
I want Extra Rice, too

322
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:15,349
Cancel the ham and cheese
hamburg steak

323
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:16,324
Lunch specials?

324
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,317
More water with lots of ice

325
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:19,416
Right away

326
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:23,090
I'll take the lunch special instead

327
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:24,461
The lunch special?

328
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,036
The suspect, Kume, confessed that

329
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:31,972
he had bought one gram from a foreigner
for 7,000 Yen when he traveled to Osaka

330
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:34,635
So expensive...

331
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:44,378
A horse fly,

332
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,313
bathed in light,

333
00:48:47,423 --> 00:48:49,983
flies in close

334
00:48:50,092 --> 00:48:53,425
to a blooming flower

335
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:01,900
I, too, might have been

336
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:05,235
someone's horse fly

337
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,706
Perhaps you, too,

338
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:18,847
had once been my breeze

339
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,467
No customers...

340
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,001
No...

341
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:20,547
I hope it'll be OK

342
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:24,753
I like it here...

343
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:27,451
This store

344
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:36,557
What's the name of
the movie adapted

345
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:40,293
from a Stephen King novel,
starring River Phoenix when he was 15?

346
00:50:40,403 --> 00:50:42,394
"Stand by Me"

347
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,166
Correct

348
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:45,605
Great!

349
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,342
OK, then,

350
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:57,045
the Hollywood movie that became
Matsuda Yusaku's last film?

351
00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:21,021
Don't look...

352
00:51:55,128 --> 00:51:57,858
Air...
You need air...

353
00:51:57,963 --> 00:51:59,260
Where's the plug?

354
00:52:01,233 --> 00:52:02,894
Stomach

355
00:52:08,775 --> 00:52:10,208
Sorry

356
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,811
Don't look...

357
00:52:14,713 --> 00:52:15,702
But...

358
00:53:27,019 --> 00:53:30,079
You're...
Fine now

359
00:53:31,724 --> 00:53:35,887
A little... while longer...

360
00:57:43,409 --> 00:57:45,070
I'm off

361
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:29,931
Going to get old

362
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:35,766
You see,
I'm going to get old

363
01:01:48,586 --> 01:01:50,851
Were you surprised?

364
01:01:51,856 --> 01:01:53,050
Yeah

365
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:55,025
But...

366
01:01:55,027 --> 01:01:59,726
But I hear there are plenty of
others like me

367
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:03,099
Someone said that

368
01:02:14,813 --> 01:02:16,371
Me, too...

369
01:02:20,018 --> 01:02:21,384
Really?

370
01:02:25,123 --> 01:02:26,954
I'm not so different

371
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,159
I see
But...

372
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:33,422
I guess you're right

373
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:38,030
When I first met you,
I sort of felt,

374
01:02:38,304 --> 01:02:40,898
that you were just like me

375
01:02:42,108 --> 01:02:43,302
A marv...

376
01:02:45,777 --> 01:02:49,713
I hit the jackpot at Pachinko

377
01:02:50,715 --> 01:02:54,550
A marvelous...
Coincidence

378
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:17,503
What?

379
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:20,304
Nothing

380
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,797
So damned pretty

381
01:04:16,034 --> 01:04:19,630
There's Sirius
And Procyon

382
01:04:19,737 --> 01:04:21,797
How did you get
an Osaka accent?

383
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,538
An Osaka accent?

384
01:04:30,748 --> 01:04:34,240
A movie
I saw a movie

385
01:04:35,588 --> 01:04:38,215
What was it called...

386
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:44,344
The other day...
How did you feel?

387
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:47,313
The other day?

388
01:06:50,188 --> 01:06:51,554
In the store

389
01:06:52,891 --> 01:06:57,487
When you breathed into me?

390
01:06:58,864 --> 01:07:00,228
No...

391
01:07:02,134 --> 01:07:05,001
When the air left your body

392
01:07:16,981 --> 01:07:18,539
Was it painful?

393
01:07:23,188 --> 01:07:24,586
Yes

394
01:07:25,824 --> 01:07:27,621
It was painful

395
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:51,972
Having a heart

396
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:54,976
was heartbreaking

397
01:08:05,797 --> 01:08:08,630
Misato's only virtue
is that she's young

398
01:08:08,733 --> 01:08:11,032
They'll stop spoiling her soon

399
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:15,003
She's just a part-time employee
That's all

400
01:08:15,106 --> 01:08:16,768
That's right

401
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:19,672
She's not going to
last long anyway

402
01:08:19,778 --> 01:08:22,405
You don't need to worry
about her

403
01:08:22,514 --> 01:08:24,243
But...

404
01:08:24,382 --> 01:08:26,613
It'll be fine

405
01:08:26,952 --> 01:08:31,252
You know there's no one
that can take your place

406
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:34,119
Really?

407
01:08:36,228 --> 01:08:37,819
Really?

408
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:42,989
7:18 PM, the 9th

409
01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:48,198
He said, "My pension's gone
You stole it, didn't you"

410
01:08:48,306 --> 01:08:51,140
He just kept accusing me
over and over,

411
01:08:51,243 --> 01:08:53,802
and I just got so mad...

412
01:08:53,912 --> 01:08:55,743
I'm sorry

413
01:08:55,847 --> 01:08:57,940
No, no, that happened in Osaka

414
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:01,314
The suspect confessed and
has been arrested

415
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:02,819
Don't worry

416
01:09:03,588 --> 01:09:07,854
It has nothing to do with you

417
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:13,295
Nothing?

418
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,060
Nothing at all

419
01:09:48,766 --> 01:09:52,760
I've got work
I can't visit until spring

420
01:09:54,439 --> 01:09:57,898
Listen, did you come here
while I was out?

421
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:01,978
I told you not to clean up my stuff

422
01:10:02,381 --> 01:10:04,144
Did you throw it out?

423
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:09,185
Well, it's not that important

424
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,984
Why don't you give them
to your neighbors?

425
01:10:47,091 --> 01:10:50,060
How strange

426
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:54,962
Your sister's having her
second baby next year

427
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,307
You don't have to grow apples with us,

428
01:10:58,451 --> 01:11:00,698
but it's time you come home

429
01:11:55,092 --> 01:11:59,927
Can't you remember how to take orders?
You've worked here for years now

430
01:12:00,998 --> 01:12:04,162
It's fine with me if you want to quit

431
01:12:06,104 --> 01:12:08,833
There's lots of guys waiting
to take your place

432
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:16,948
What's so funny
It's revolting when you smile

433
01:12:17,748 --> 01:12:19,079
Sorry

434
01:12:22,154 --> 01:12:25,122
Movies for Crying

435
01:12:53,217 --> 01:12:54,810
Excuse me

436
01:12:55,252 --> 01:12:56,480
Hello

437
01:12:57,488 --> 01:12:59,457
How can I help?

438
01:13:00,391 --> 01:13:01,824
This one

439
01:13:23,215 --> 01:13:25,479
Thank you for your business

440
01:13:33,225 --> 01:13:35,693
Did you guys already do it?

441
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:40,225
You did it with Junichi, right?

442
01:13:41,399 --> 01:13:45,234
You don't have to hide it
You're seeing him, right?

443
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:47,698
No

444
01:13:48,739 --> 01:13:51,368
Is that your boyfriend?

445
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:55,740
I saw you in the park

446
01:13:56,381 --> 01:13:58,747
You were with him

447
01:14:01,485 --> 01:14:04,819
I bet Junichi doesn't know
about that guy

448
01:14:10,194 --> 01:14:13,653
You do this with anybody

449
01:14:14,131 --> 01:14:16,395
Girls these days...

450
01:14:23,074 --> 01:14:24,542
Harue...

451
01:14:36,954 --> 01:14:40,220
Hey, touch me
Here

452
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:43,953
Hey, touch me...

453
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:45,791
Here...

454
01:14:47,599 --> 01:14:49,032
Harue

455
01:15:12,224 --> 01:15:15,989
I am an air doll

456
01:15:21,065 --> 01:15:25,502
A substitute for handling
sexual desire

457
01:15:29,073 --> 01:15:30,837
I am...

458
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:40,617
Happy birthday to you

459
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:44,586
Happy birthday to you

460
01:15:44,756 --> 01:15:48,521
Happy birthday, dear Nozomi

461
01:15:49,226 --> 01:15:50,784
Nozomi...

462
01:15:55,367 --> 01:15:57,858
How is it?

463
01:15:57,969 --> 01:15:59,458
Nozomi...

464
01:16:00,971 --> 01:16:03,634
The white star of the first
magnitude, Procyon

465
01:16:03,742 --> 01:16:07,802
The triangle linking
those 3 stars

466
01:16:07,912 --> 01:16:11,076
is called The Winter Triangle

467
01:16:11,182 --> 01:16:12,615
Got that?

468
01:16:13,717 --> 01:16:15,717
No, I'll get wet

469
01:16:19,858 --> 01:16:21,449
I have to pee

470
01:17:34,365 --> 01:17:35,765
What?

471
01:17:42,538 --> 01:17:44,105
Nozomi?

472
01:17:47,444 --> 01:17:52,006
You bought her a cake
Is it her birthday?

473
01:17:53,051 --> 01:17:54,313
No...

474
01:17:55,386 --> 01:17:58,948
I got one for you, too
On the day I welcomed you here

475
01:17:59,524 --> 01:18:02,550
I don't know...
I don't remember that

476
01:18:02,661 --> 01:18:04,355
I really did

477
01:18:04,762 --> 01:18:06,697
I took a picture

478
01:18:14,905 --> 01:18:16,167
I...

479
01:18:17,908 --> 01:18:20,139
I found a heart

480
01:18:22,546 --> 01:18:24,014
A heart?

481
01:18:24,215 --> 01:18:27,115
Yes, a heart

482
01:18:30,521 --> 01:18:31,783
Why?

483
01:18:35,225 --> 01:18:36,716
I don't know

484
01:18:41,565 --> 01:18:46,832
Tell me,
what do you like about me?

485
01:18:50,175 --> 01:18:51,766
What do I like?

486
01:18:56,213 --> 01:18:57,908
You don't know, do you?

487
01:18:58,582 --> 01:19:03,452
Even the name, Nozomi,
is your old girlfriend's name

488
01:19:06,358 --> 01:19:09,327
You read my blog?

489
01:19:09,426 --> 01:19:14,329
I'm just a substitute for her

490
01:19:16,967 --> 01:19:18,958
But...

491
01:19:21,372 --> 01:19:23,101
I mean...

492
01:19:24,175 --> 01:19:28,805
Sure, at first,
I was lonely without her

493
01:19:30,648 --> 01:19:33,082
But now, it's different

494
01:19:35,286 --> 01:19:37,150
No, what am I saying...

495
01:19:37,354 --> 01:19:39,323
Why me?

496
01:19:43,627 --> 01:19:45,118
Why?

497
01:19:48,766 --> 01:19:51,360
It doesn't have to be me, right?

498
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:54,067
Right?

499
01:20:04,615 --> 01:20:05,947
The picture...

500
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:18,654
Listen, will you do me a favor?

501
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,761
Can you go back to being the old doll?

502
01:20:27,471 --> 01:20:28,939
The old doll?

503
01:20:30,207 --> 01:20:34,542
Yeah, the normal, plain old doll
Can't you?

504
01:20:38,082 --> 01:20:42,679
You wish I hadn't found a heart?

505
01:20:44,322 --> 01:20:45,413
Yeah

506
01:20:46,757 --> 01:20:48,622
It's just annoying

507
01:20:50,528 --> 01:20:53,128
This stuff annoys me,
which is why

508
01:20:53,247 --> 01:20:55,658
I chose you in the first place

509
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:00,997
I'm annoying...

510
01:21:02,306 --> 01:21:05,332
What a mean thing to say

511
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:08,537
That's not what I mean, it's not

512
01:21:09,012 --> 01:21:12,106
You're not annoying,
it's humans who are

513
01:21:12,216 --> 01:21:14,082
Nozomi!

514
01:21:21,525 --> 01:21:23,015
Nozomi!

515
01:21:42,713 --> 01:21:44,271
Nozomi!

516
01:23:05,296 --> 01:23:06,854
Thank you

517
01:23:40,832 --> 01:23:43,198
I hate dogs

518
01:23:45,036 --> 01:23:47,698
They get old so fast

519
01:23:48,706 --> 01:23:52,198
and die before you know it

520
01:23:54,746 --> 01:24:00,309
Having a dog just makes you lonely

521
01:24:05,722 --> 01:24:10,751
Is this you?

522
01:24:10,862 --> 01:24:12,021
Yes

523
01:24:12,363 --> 01:24:16,628
I used to be a substitute
high school teacher

524
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:21,868
A substitute?

525
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:23,463
That's right

526
01:24:24,841 --> 01:24:29,211
I was always an empty substitute

527
01:24:35,019 --> 01:24:37,010
Were you lonely?

528
01:24:37,889 --> 01:24:40,618
I wonder...

529
01:24:43,293 --> 01:24:46,490
I can't remember anymore

530
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:53,225
Do you mind,

531
01:24:55,105 --> 01:24:59,337
touching me?

532
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:34,201
That feels so good

533
01:25:36,613 --> 01:25:40,345
Me, too... See?

534
01:25:43,186 --> 01:25:48,250
They always say,
people with cold hands,

535
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:52,918
have warm hearts

536
01:25:55,365 --> 01:25:58,061
Maybe it's just a superstition...

537
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:02,689
Welcome home

538
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:07,787
I'm home

539
01:28:13,604 --> 01:28:17,335
I made you, but I don't
know the answer

540
01:28:20,011 --> 01:28:22,604
But I doubt even God knows

541
01:28:22,712 --> 01:28:26,204
why the humans
he made have hearts

542
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:31,920
Do you wish you'd
never found a heart?

543
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:41,356
I don't know, but...

544
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,163
It hurts

545
01:29:32,783 --> 01:29:35,717
They all started out the same,

546
01:29:37,721 --> 01:29:42,351
but by the time they
come back here,

547
01:29:45,095 --> 01:29:48,759
you can tell from their faces
whether they've been loved

548
01:29:54,404 --> 01:29:59,341
I think that must mean
they all have hearts, too

549
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:11,586
What will happen to them?

550
01:30:15,693 --> 01:30:19,094
Once a year, in spring,
I throw them all away

551
01:30:21,064 --> 01:30:23,465
Unfortunately, they're
"Not burnable garbage"

552
01:30:25,136 --> 01:30:28,730
Not burnable garbage

553
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:35,537
After all, once we die,
we're "Burnable garbage"

554
01:30:35,645 --> 01:30:37,806
It's not such a big difference

555
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:44,143
Burnable garbage

556
01:31:19,023 --> 01:31:22,117
Can you tell me one thing?

557
01:31:25,061 --> 01:31:28,395
Was everything you saw
in this world sad?

558
01:31:30,634 --> 01:31:34,832
Was there something, anything,
that was beautiful?

559
01:31:43,913 --> 01:31:45,541
I'm glad to hear that

560
01:31:50,054 --> 01:31:53,854
Thank you for having me

561
01:31:59,029 --> 01:32:01,429
No, thank you

562
01:32:03,501 --> 01:32:04,865
Off you go

563
01:32:07,137 --> 01:32:08,798
I'm off

564
01:32:29,926 --> 01:32:34,829
I don't mind if I'm a substitute
for someone else

565
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:41,070
You're not a substitute for anyone

566
01:32:46,543 --> 01:32:48,774
I'll do anything for you

567
01:32:49,046 --> 01:32:53,345
That's what I was born for

568
01:32:54,518 --> 01:32:58,476
Whatever you want

569
01:33:00,524 --> 01:33:01,854
Really?

570
01:33:03,027 --> 01:33:04,186
Yes

571
01:33:05,362 --> 01:33:09,024
I can do whatever I want?

572
01:33:09,966 --> 01:33:12,868
Yes, whatever you want

573
01:33:17,774 --> 01:33:21,939
I couldn't ask anyone else, but...

574
01:33:23,012 --> 01:33:24,344
With you...

575
01:33:27,818 --> 01:33:31,082
Something only I can do?

576
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,114
Yes

577
01:33:36,292 --> 01:33:37,487
What is it?

578
01:33:40,631 --> 01:33:42,496
I want to let your air out

579
01:33:45,769 --> 01:33:48,896
Let my air out?

580
01:33:51,274 --> 01:33:52,264
Yes

581
01:34:02,453 --> 01:34:03,353
But...

582
01:34:03,354 --> 01:34:04,912
Don't worry

583
01:34:07,423 --> 01:34:10,722
I'll breathe into you like before

584
01:34:12,162 --> 01:34:13,253
But...

585
01:34:15,164 --> 01:34:16,393
Why?

586
01:34:38,655 --> 01:34:42,956
Sure, do whatever you want

587
01:38:55,945 --> 01:38:58,278
Where's your plug?

588
01:39:32,783 --> 01:39:36,479
I'll fill you with my breath

589
01:39:42,926 --> 01:39:45,257
Just like you did for me

590
01:41:17,921 --> 01:41:20,185
I couldn't exhale

591
01:41:20,724 --> 01:41:26,060
my breath into Junichi

592
01:43:58,314 --> 01:43:59,577
You alone?

593
01:44:03,619 --> 01:44:05,144
You are alone

594
01:44:12,529 --> 01:44:14,189
What a jerk

595
01:44:27,978 --> 01:44:36,146
I found a heart

596
01:44:42,626 --> 01:44:44,457
Did you see the news?

597
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,189
They found his body
in the trash

598
01:44:47,296 --> 01:44:49,856
Just across the river

599
01:45:36,947 --> 01:45:38,743
Let's trade

600
01:45:42,953 --> 01:45:46,252
Moe, don't touch the garbage

601
01:45:46,355 --> 01:45:47,653
OK

602
01:45:48,992 --> 01:45:49,980
Off you go

603
01:45:50,092 --> 01:45:51,617
I'm off

604
01:45:55,545 --> 01:46:01,345
Subtitles: Arigon

605
01:46:13,315 --> 01:46:17,479
Mommy

606
01:49:03,386 --> 01:49:04,546
Hey!

607
01:49:05,555 --> 01:49:07,250
Moe! Your gym clothes!

608
01:52:00,997 --> 01:52:03,295
Beautiful
