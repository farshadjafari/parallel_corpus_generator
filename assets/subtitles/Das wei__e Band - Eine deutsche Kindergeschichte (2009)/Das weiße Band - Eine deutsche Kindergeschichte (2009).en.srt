00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:14,629
THE WHITE RIBBON
A German children's story

2
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,378
<i>I don't know if the story
I want to tell you</i>

3
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:17,558
<i>is entirely true.</i>

4
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:20,931
<i>Some of it I only know by hearsay.</i>

5
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:25,413
<i>After so many years,
a lot of it is still obscure,</i>

6
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,682
<i>and many questions
remain unanswered.</i>

7
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:31,914
<i>But I think I must tell
of the strange events</i>

8
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:35,930
<i>that occurred in our village.</i>

9
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:38,997
<i>They could perhaps</i>

10
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,451
<i>clarify some things
that happened in this country.</i>

11
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:47,218
<i>It all began, I think,
with the doctor's riding accident.</i>

12
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,399
<i>After his dressage session
on the Baron's estate,</i>

13
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,031
<i>he was headed home,</i>

14
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:58,460
<i>to see if any patients had arrived.</i>

15
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:01,118
<i>Entering the garden,</i>

16
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:04,256
<i>his horse tripped on a wire</i>

17
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,336
<i>strung between two trees.</i>

18
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:11,671
<i>His daughter saw the accident
from a window,</i>

19
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,433
<i>informed their neighbor,</i>

20
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:16,682
<i>who informed the estate's steward,</i>

21
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,323
<i>so that the agonizing doctor</i>

22
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:22,507
<i>could be transported
to the district hospital</i>

23
00:03:22,627 --> 00:03:25,050
<i>over 30 km away.</i>

24
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,937
<i>The neighbor,
a single woman of around 40,</i>

25
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,596
<i>was the village midwife.</i>

26
00:03:31,806 --> 00:03:34,977
<i>Since the death of the doctor's wife
in childbirth,</i>

27
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:40,600
<i>she had become invaluable for him
as housekeeper and receptionist.</i>

28
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:44,201
<i>After tending the doctor's
two children,</i>

29
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,759
<i>she went to the school
to fetch her own son, Karl.</i>

30
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:50,462
- Have you seen Anni?
- You don't say hello?

31
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:52,634
Hello, Mrs Wagner. Forgive him.

32
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:53,865
Hi, Klara.

33
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:57,012
We're so worried
that Martin forgot his manners.

34
00:03:57,456 --> 00:03:58,538
That's all right.

35
00:03:58,586 --> 00:03:59,966
How is the Doctor?

36
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,341
Not very well.

37
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:03,563
- Must he stay in the hospital?
- I don't know.

38
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:06,116
We'll go see Anna, to help her out.

39
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,324
Good!

40
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,967
- You enjoyed the choir?
- Yes.

41
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:11,103
Show how well you sang.

42
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:22,459
Good bye, teacher.

43
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:29,048
Last one is a rotten egg!

44
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,788
<i>If I remember correctly,</i>

45
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:40,872
<i>it seemed odd to me
that the kids around Klara,</i>

46
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:44,987
<i>instead of scattering
after school to their homes,</i>

47
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,737
<i>headed together
to the exit of the village.</i>

48
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:53,245
I could cut out some animals
for you,

49
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:55,571
like last week.

50
00:04:57,348 --> 00:04:58,646
You'd like that?

51
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:11,220
We can color them together.

52
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:18,298
Or cut them
from the lovely colored paper?

53
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,992
The golden one
that I got for Easter?

54
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:27,293
Come on...

55
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,778
Well, I'll make us something to eat.

56
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:55,079
What if he never comes back?

57
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:57,911
What?

58
00:05:58,564 --> 00:05:59,795
Come on!

59
00:06:01,755 --> 00:06:03,341
Don't be silly!

60
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:06,170
It'll heal, just like the flu.

61
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:11,822
Remember last winter?

62
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:16,649
You were very sick, weren't you?

63
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,031
And then...

64
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:03,690
Hi, Anni!

65
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:05,108
How are you?

66
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:06,894
Can we help you?

67
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,882
How did the wire get there?
Did the Doctor say?

68
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:13,173
He was in no mood to talk:

69
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,593
his collarbone
was stuck in his neck.

70
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:19,069
I asked his daughter.
She has no idea.

71
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:21,028
He rides through there daily.

72
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:22,874
- Did you look at the wire?
- Sure.

73
00:07:23,014 --> 00:07:25,350
It's thin, but strong.

74
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,408
Almost invisible.

75
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:51,062
Sorry, Madame.
You play too well for me.

76
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,980
Don't apologize, concentrate.
It'll help us both.

77
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:59,492
You play too fast for me, M'am.
I'm not Frederic the Great.

78
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,800
How could he have played Schubert?

79
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,925
Let's do the Variation again.

80
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:28,795
Darling, if you like the music,
sit beside me and turn the pages.

81
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,540
If you're bored, go to your room.

82
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,456
Or stay out of my sight.

83
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:35,509
I get nervous if you saunter around.

84
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,875
What time is it?
Where's the nanny?

85
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:44,635
With the twins, I presume.

86
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:47,135
- It's twenty to nine.
- Twenty to nine?

87
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:49,057
Way past your bedtime!

88
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,966
Has he done his homework?

89
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:52,441
Of course, M'am.

90
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:56,624
You want to turn the pages for me or not?

91
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:58,110
Yes.

92
00:08:58,475 --> 00:08:59,847
Then come here!

93
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:02,893
Let's go back to the Theme.

94
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:06,320
Practice the Variations.
Or it's no fun.

95
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,203
I'll do my best, Baroness.

96
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:10,953
So from Bar 9.

97
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:23,522
Please forgive us, Father.

98
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:27,053
Forgive us.

99
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:35,063
Tonight, no one here has eaten.

100
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,316
When night fell,
and you hadn't returned,

101
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:44,788
your mother searched the village
in tears.

102
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,095
Could we have enjoyed our meal,
fearing for you?

103
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:55,381
Can we enjoy our meal now,

104
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:58,215
after hearing your lying excuses?

105
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:01,890
I don't know what's worse:

106
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:04,360
your absence, or your coming back.

107
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:10,322
Tonight we'll all go to bed hungry.

108
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:21,902
You surely agree with me

109
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:24,745
that I can't leave
your offense unpunished

110
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:28,364
if we want to keep on living
in mutual respect.

111
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:33,179
So tomorrow evening at this hour,

112
00:10:33,538 --> 00:10:36,113
I'll give each of you,
in front of your siblings,

113
00:10:36,484 --> 00:10:38,407
ten strokes of the cane.

114
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:42,905
Until then,
you may ponder over your offense.

115
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:46,644
Do you agree with me?

116
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:48,556
Yes, Father.

117
00:10:51,253 --> 00:10:53,577
All right then.
Go to bed now, all of you.

118
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:18,451
Don't touch me!

119
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:23,250
Your mother and I will sleep poorly:

120
00:11:23,463 --> 00:11:27,913
I have to beat you and the strokes
will cause us more pain than you.

121
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,176
Leave us alone, and go to bed!

122
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:38,719
When you were little,

123
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:42,106
your mother sometimes tied a ribbon

124
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:44,216
in your hair or around your arm.

125
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:48,482
Its white color was to remind you
of innocence and purity.

126
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:55,220
I thought you were now
well-mannered enough

127
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:57,993
to get by without such reminders.

128
00:12:01,231 --> 00:12:02,610
I was wrong.

129
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:08,190
Tomorrow, once your punishment
has purified you,

130
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:10,716
your mother
will re-tie a ribbon on you,

131
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:12,760
and you'll wear it

132
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:17,028
until we can trust you again.

133
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:20,827
Where is the wire now?

134
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:25,264
Who removed it?

135
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:26,484
I don't know.

136
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:27,958
You weren't here?

137
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,915
You were in town with your father?

138
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:34,105
No.

139
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:36,514
- Then you were here.
- I was at school.

140
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:39,139
When you left,
was the wire still here?

141
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:40,629
I didn't check.

142
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:44,038
- When did you get back?
- At noon.

143
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:47,155
I make lunch for the Doctor
and the kids.

144
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:49,905
I've helped him since his wife died.

145
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,217
Since when?

146
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:53,991
Since Rudolf's birth, 5 years ago.

147
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:56,509
I'm the midwife here.
We work together.

148
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:58,631
- But you saw nothing?
- No.

149
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:01,446
How long was the wire there?

150
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,908
I never saw it.

151
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:06,889
Nobody saw it before, or afterwards!

152
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:10,907
It wound itself around two trees,
and vanished by itself!

153
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:13,451
Right?

154
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:14,648
Mom!

155
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:16,107
What is it ?

156
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:22,509
Excuse me.

157
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:24,988
<i>The day after the doctor's accident</i>

158
00:13:25,547 --> 00:13:28,534
<i>brought no solution to the mystery.</i>

159
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:32,027
<i>Then a second,
far more tragic incident,</i>

160
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,780
<i>almost made people forget
the previous one.</i>

161
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:41,142
<i>The wife of a tenant farmer
died in a work-accident.</i>

162
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,923
<i>The woman, who had an injured arm,</i>

163
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:50,209
<i>was dispensed by the steward
from harvesting chores,</i>

164
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:55,481
<i>and assigned to lighter work
in the sawmill.</i>

165
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:05,785
Stay outside! I'm not done.

166
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,835
You get out!

167
00:15:41,846 --> 00:15:45,745
<i>On the same day,
I had a strange encounter.</i>

168
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,636
<i>The weather was beautiful and hot,</i>

169
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:53,658
<i>so I decided to improve my meager
menu with some brown trout,</i>

170
00:15:53,962 --> 00:15:56,740
<i>which are plentiful in the river.</i>

171
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:01,221
<i>The Baron allowed me to fish there.</i>

172
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:05,592
Martin!

173
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:22,577
Martin, be careful!

174
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:26,110
Are you insane?

175
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:27,779
You want to break your neck?

176
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,105
Hello, sir.

177
00:16:29,674 --> 00:16:31,893
What's this?
Have you gone mad?

178
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,337
You know how high that is?

179
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:37,798
Didn't you hear me shout to you?

180
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,261
Yes, I did.

181
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:40,538
Well?

182
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:44,573
Well?

183
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,231
You saw me and wanted to impress me?

184
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:53,955
So why...

185
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,693
I gave God a chance to kill me.

186
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:01,344
He didn't do it.
So he's pleased with me.

187
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:03,000
What are you saying?

188
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:05,837
He doesn't want me to die.

189
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,510
Who doesn't want you to die?

190
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:10,500
God.

191
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,786
Why would God want you to die?

192
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:26,019
Promise me you won't do it again!

193
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:29,449
Look at me!

194
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:31,691
Promise it!

195
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:37,902
You don't trust me, huh?

196
00:17:38,342 --> 00:17:39,607
Yes, I do, sir.

197
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,455
All right.

198
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:47,683
Go home. Tomorrow after your
piano lesson, I'll talk to your dad.

199
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,645
No, please, don't tell him!

200
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:54,555
It's there.

201
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:01,305
Careful, it's all rotten.

202
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:14,535
Who sent her up here?

203
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,011
No idea.

204
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,743
We had to collect loose ends.
She fell through.

205
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:22,807
You saw it?

206
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,180
Not really.

207
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:29,071
You know how it works.

208
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:33,201
The foremen assign
weaker harvesters up here.

209
00:18:35,644 --> 00:18:36,909
Who assigned her?

210
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:42,546
<i>On my way home, after
that strange encounter with Martin,</i>

211
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:46,134
<i>was when I first met Eva...</i>

212
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:48,118
Hello!

213
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:50,007
Excuse me!

214
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:55,240
Sorry for accosting you.

215
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,083
Aren't you the new nanny
on the estate?

216
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:00,269
Why?

217
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,663
They say you're from Treglitz.

218
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,905
Who says that?

219
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:07,479
The locals.

220
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:11,454
So?

221
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:13,619
Nothing...

222
00:19:14,316 --> 00:19:15,442
I don't know...

223
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:18,576
I'm the schoolteacher here.

224
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:20,503
I just thought...

225
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:24,546
When I saw you, I thought...

226
00:19:25,862 --> 00:19:28,049
I'm the tailor's son from Vasendorf.

227
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:29,570
- I know.
- What?

228
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:31,338
The Baroness told me.

229
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:32,704
What?

230
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:35,700
That the teacher is
from the village next to mine.

231
00:19:35,894 --> 00:19:37,027
I see, yes...

232
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,134
Well... I thought...

233
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:42,378
Looks as if you're going there...

234
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:44,166
Where?

235
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:45,642
Back home. To Treglitz.

236
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:47,655
Yes?

237
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,242
- Are you going there?
- Yes, I am.

238
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:52,324
I thought...

239
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:57,507
since you'll go through our village,
you could...

240
00:19:57,941 --> 00:20:01,631
say hello to my dad,
and give him a fish?

241
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:04,307
What?

242
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:06,315
He'd love that.

243
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:09,054
Especially over the weekend.

244
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:15,628
How...?

245
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,239
I don't know.

246
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,462
Unfortunately,
I have nothing to wrap...

247
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:24,305
Neither do I.

248
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:26,660
Unfortunately...

249
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:29,771
We could tie them on
with fishing line.

250
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:31,316
Just like that, on the bike?

251
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:35,548
That's not a very good idea.

252
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,989
Right, it was just an idea.

253
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:39,500
Yes.

254
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:49,156
Is it your bike?

255
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:52,015
No, the estate's.

256
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:57,944
Is this your first day off?

257
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:02,431
You must be glad to go home.

258
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,931
I can imagine.

259
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:13,958
Well... I've still a long way to go.

260
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:17,282
Well...

261
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:18,699
Good-bye.

262
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:20,682
Good-bye.

263
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:23,089
If you see my father in Vasendorf,

264
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:25,202
say hello to him from me.

265
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:28,315
I don't know your father.

266
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:29,903
That's true.

267
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,275
It's my first time on a bike!

268
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,765
You're doing fine!

269
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,505
But be careful!

270
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:04,567
The woman today,
what was wrong with her?

271
00:22:04,775 --> 00:22:05,861
Which woman?

272
00:22:08,472 --> 00:22:09,929
I see. She was dead.

273
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,184
What's that?

274
00:22:15,393 --> 00:22:16,407
What?

275
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:18,900
Dead.

276
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,488
What's "dead"?

277
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:24,317
Quite a question!

278
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:27,337
It's when one doesn't live anymore.

279
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,240
When one has stopped living.

280
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:32,788
When does one stop living?

281
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:36,962
When one is very old, or very ill.

282
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:39,619
And the woman?

283
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:42,515
She had an accident.

284
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:44,340
An "accident"?

285
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:47,410
Yes. It's when you're badly hurt.

286
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:49,191
Like Dad?

287
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,301
Yes, but much worse than that.

288
00:22:52,884 --> 00:22:55,470
So bad,
your body can't take it anymore.

289
00:22:58,173 --> 00:22:59,746
And then you're dead ?

290
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:02,048
Yes.

291
00:23:03,593 --> 00:23:06,259
But most people
don't have an accident.

292
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:10,339
- So they're not dead.
- No, they die much later.

293
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,936
When?

294
00:23:13,156 --> 00:23:16,380
Well... later,
when they're really old.

295
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,253
Does everyone die?

296
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,490
Yes.

297
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:27,838
Everyone, really?

298
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,614
Yes, everyone has to die.

299
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,382
But not you, Anni?

300
00:23:34,857 --> 00:23:36,027
Me too.

301
00:23:36,155 --> 00:23:37,316
Everyone.

302
00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:40,601
But not Dad?

303
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:42,684
Dad too.

304
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:44,890
Me too?

305
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:49,105
You too.
But not for a very long time.

306
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:51,229
All of us, only in a very long time.

307
00:23:53,104 --> 00:23:56,249
One can't fight it?
It has to happen?

308
00:23:57,513 --> 00:23:59,822
Yes, but not for a very long time.

309
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,775
And Mom?

310
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:08,099
She didn't go on a trip?

311
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:12,299
Is she dead too?

312
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:16,357
Yes.

313
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:18,537
She's dead too.

314
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:21,625
But that was a long time ago.

315
00:25:21,511 --> 00:25:22,635
Klara!

316
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:36,381
Martin, you coming?

317
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:15,284
Karli?

318
00:29:52,566 --> 00:29:53,872
You can come in.

319
00:29:54,315 --> 00:29:55,507
What is it?

320
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,515
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

321
00:29:57,698 --> 00:29:58,993
It's a boy.

322
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,902
What? Don't you want a brother?

323
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,088
Lucky your father didn't hear you.

324
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,866
I'm sorry.

325
00:30:14,827 --> 00:30:17,333
They knew it was dangerous for her.

326
00:30:17,486 --> 00:30:18,851
What do you want?

327
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:20,732
You want to sue the Baron?

328
00:30:21,836 --> 00:30:23,589
Or murder the steward?

329
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,070
Go cut off his head
with your scythe!

330
00:30:27,054 --> 00:30:29,428
Won't bring your mother
back to life.

331
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:38,201
Father, you loved our mother.

332
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:39,776
Shut up!

333
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:44,877
<i>After those two days in July,</i>

334
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,291
<i>life in the village
got back to normal.</i>

335
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:52,594
<i>The daily harvesting chores
exhausted everyone.</i>

336
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:56,874
<i>Most of the kids pitched in
to help their parents.</i>

337
00:30:57,682 --> 00:31:01,047
<i>I took up the steward's offer</i>

338
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:05,060
<i>to be his secretary
during the harvesting,</i>

339
00:31:05,423 --> 00:31:08,403
<i>as I hoped it would enable me</i>

340
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,815
<i>to see the young girl again.</i>

341
00:31:11,016 --> 00:31:15,020
<i>I couldn't get her out of my mind
after our meeting.</i>

342
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:19,457
<i>But she rarely came out
of the manor house.</i>

343
00:31:21,385 --> 00:31:24,734
<i>The doctor was still
in the hospital.</i>

344
00:31:25,412 --> 00:31:27,175
<i>Anna and Rudolf, his two children,</i>

345
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:30,698
<i>were cared for meanwhile
by the midwife.</i>

346
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:33,548
<i>After the farmer's wife's funeral,</i>

347
00:31:33,748 --> 00:31:35,962
<i>that the whole village attended,</i>

348
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:39,330
<i>both accidents were forgotten.</i>

349
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:42,003
<i>Until the end of the summer</i>

350
00:31:42,197 --> 00:31:45,657
<i>when the harvest feast
reunited the whole village,</i>

351
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,849
<i>first in a joyful mood,</i>

352
00:31:48,413 --> 00:31:51,259
<i>then in horror and perplexity.</i>

353
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:01,041
My thanks to all of you.

354
00:32:01,535 --> 00:32:02,733
You have worked well.

355
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,346
The heavens were kind
and the barns are full.

356
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,738
So the beer can flow,

357
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:10,874
and you won't starve today!

358
00:32:11,238 --> 00:32:13,489
Long live the Baron!

359
00:32:13,748 --> 00:32:14,847
Long may he live!

360
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,810
Most honorable Baron

361
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,910
and Baroness,

362
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,708
dear merrymakers...

363
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:30,195
Let us hear on this festive occasion

364
00:32:30,838 --> 00:32:34,108
Psalm 145, Verse 15:

365
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:37,672
"The eyes of all wait upon thee, Lord;

366
00:32:38,228 --> 00:32:41,876
"and thou givest them their meat
in due season...."

367
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:44,422
In the name of the Father,

368
00:32:45,112 --> 00:32:46,269
the Son,

369
00:32:47,087 --> 00:32:48,862
and the Holy Ghost.

370
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:50,352
Amen.

371
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,641
Now enjoy your meal.

372
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,072
Eat and drink to your fill!
You earned it!

373
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:49,478
You promised us
a chorale by your pupils.

374
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:51,896
Ask the pastor, Baroness.

375
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:55,744
We're still practicing
for the confirmation feast.

376
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:58,623
That's in spring!
Now it's the fall.

377
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:03,070
Our little singers aren't all
very musical. Sorry!

378
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,963
Well, you two "mothers"?

379
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:20,748
Not taking part in the festivities?

380
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:23,255
It's so nice here in the shade.

381
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:26,416
Our son seems to be enjoying that!

382
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:27,516
Yes.

383
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:29,728
I can imagine.

384
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:32,050
Who wouldn't like it.

385
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:33,612
Georg!

386
00:34:35,884 --> 00:34:37,070
What about yout?

387
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:40,938
Aren't you bored
caring for other's children,

388
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:43,775
with all the young lads over there?

389
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,976
No, sir.
I like being with the children.

390
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:53,219
How old are you anyway?

391
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:54,679
17, sir.

392
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:55,835
17!

393
00:34:57,563 --> 00:35:00,311
Wouldn't you rather hold a suitor

394
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:02,487
than the Baroness's kids?

395
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:05,804
- Leave her alone, George!
- What did I do?

396
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:10,146
Won't you get us
something to eat, Emma?

397
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:14,063
If you'll mind
the children a moment, I'll go.

398
00:35:52,938 --> 00:35:55,771
He was drunk,
but they couldn't stop him.

399
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,324
Leave Frieda alone!

400
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:19,900
Shove it!

401
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,771
...I'm the rooster on the tower...

402
00:36:24,876 --> 00:36:27,530
Someone cut off
the Baron's cabbages.

403
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:28,940
What?

404
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,481
Someone cut off
the Baron's cabbages!

405
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:41,726
- I never learned.
- Neither did I .

406
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,724
You have to count out loud.

407
00:36:44,956 --> 00:36:46,467
One, two, three.

408
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:58,266
Your pupils will laugh
when they see us dancing, sir!

409
00:36:58,376 --> 00:37:00,371
They'd better not!

410
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:03,414
And stop being so formal with me.
Am I so old?

411
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:09,512
It's coming along!

412
00:37:09,864 --> 00:37:10,905
Well...

413
00:37:11,672 --> 00:37:13,371
Don't look at your feet.

414
00:37:24,157 --> 00:37:26,206
Quite a job, huh?

415
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,222
It's disgusting!

416
00:37:30,492 --> 00:37:34,237
It was an old custom:
"Harvest's done, pay everyone,

417
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:38,150
"If we don't get our due,
your cabbage'll be sliced for you."

418
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:41,117
Well, they sure slurped down enough!

419
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,347
Come in.

420
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:29,494
What do you want?

421
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:32,731
A favor, Father.

422
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,730
Yes?

423
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:46,646
Yes?

424
00:38:47,514 --> 00:38:51,061
I found it.
It's wounded.

425
00:38:51,527 --> 00:38:52,682
And?

426
00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:54,804
May I keep it?

427
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:00,289
How will you go about that?

428
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,775
We'll heal it.

429
00:39:05,873 --> 00:39:07,748
And when it's healed?

430
00:39:09,452 --> 00:39:12,480
Won't you be attached to it then?

431
00:39:14,215 --> 00:39:15,699
Will you let it fly away?

432
00:39:18,452 --> 00:39:20,679
Piepsi still lives in a cage.

433
00:39:21,297 --> 00:39:24,534
Yes, but it grew up in captivity.

434
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,724
This one is used to freedom.

435
00:39:27,286 --> 00:39:29,943
Will you set it free,
once it's healed?

436
00:39:33,494 --> 00:39:35,027
Have you asked Mother?

437
00:39:35,195 --> 00:39:36,257
Yes.

438
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,161
What did she say?

439
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:41,083
That it was for you to decide,
Father.

440
00:39:42,164 --> 00:39:43,327
Really?

441
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:45,228
That's what she said.

442
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,458
You'll really take care of it?

443
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,211
Yes.

444
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:55,987
You realize that's
a heavy responsibility?

445
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,411
You'll be its father and mother.

446
00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:09,606
We'll have to find a cage
for your patient.

447
00:40:10,132 --> 00:40:12,528
Did you do it, or didn't you?

448
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:15,992
- Seems somebody saw you.
- So what?

449
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:19,405
They're lucky
they still have their heads!

450
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:22,793
I have to tell you, Father:
I'm proud of it!

451
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:25,597
Sit down!

452
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:34,126
What did you intend to do?

453
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,954
Tell me.

454
00:40:39,692 --> 00:40:41,003
Come on. Tell me.

455
00:40:43,672 --> 00:40:45,315
You know why, Father.

456
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,942
Because of your mother?

457
00:40:47,795 --> 00:40:50,360
You think they caused her death?

458
00:40:51,347 --> 00:40:52,496
You think that?

459
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:56,251
That I'm not man enough
to settle it?

460
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,987
Know what your act
may do for us all?

461
00:41:16,646 --> 00:41:18,168
If Frieda loses her job,

462
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:20,878
which keeps us alive
for a whole year?

463
00:41:21,297 --> 00:41:23,706
If we can't work here
in the summer?

464
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:31,695
You want to marry
and run the farm in two years?

465
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:36,228
You'll feed everyone
without the help of the estate?

466
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,737
How do you know they're responsible?

467
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,900
How do you know they're innocent?

468
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:49,378
I don't know.

469
00:41:51,202 --> 00:41:53,106
But I also don't know the opposite!

470
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,338
What do you mean "not there"?

471
00:41:55,384 --> 00:41:57,733
He's disappeared.
I looked all over.

472
00:41:58,161 --> 00:42:01,688
He hasn't disappeared.
When did you last see him?

473
00:42:01,891 --> 00:42:03,291
Around 2 o'clock.

474
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:04,541
Around 2?

475
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,380
- You know what time it is?
- I know, Baron.

476
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:12,836
What does my wife say?

477
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,510
She sent me to you. She's terrified.

478
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:18,603
I can imagine.
You're an idiot, Huber.

479
00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:21,288
Why do you think you're here?

480
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:25,327
To take care of one child!
Is that so hard?

481
00:42:25,766 --> 00:42:27,429
I'm so sorry, Baron.

482
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,210
You can shove your excuses!

483
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,619
Where did you last see my son?

484
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:37,878
Here. He left to play
with the other kids.

485
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,804
- Where?
- He didn't say.

486
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:42,329
My wife noticed nothing either?

487
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:44,617
The cabbage heads affair upset her.

488
00:42:44,701 --> 00:42:46,639
She retired, indisposed.

489
00:42:47,061 --> 00:42:48,561
Indisposed?

490
00:42:48,806 --> 00:42:51,072
Yes, a terrible migraine attack.

491
00:42:52,885 --> 00:42:54,449
This is a madhouse!

492
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:56,690
Have you seen my son?

493
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:57,911
No.

494
00:42:58,414 --> 00:43:01,713
Ask your sons. Sigi has disappeared
with some other kids.

495
00:43:02,114 --> 00:43:05,010
- What does it mean?
- That he's disappeared, dammit!

496
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:08,061
<i>The steward's kids said
they'd only seen Sigi</i>

497
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:09,568
<i>very briefly,</i>

498
00:43:10,047 --> 00:43:11,815
<i>that he'd gone off with other kids.</i>

499
00:43:12,085 --> 00:43:14,141
<i>They didn't pay
much attention to it.</i>

500
00:43:15,525 --> 00:43:18,068
<i>The search began
shortly after midnight.</i>

501
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,259
<i>The searchers, tired,
some still drunk,</i>

502
00:43:22,422 --> 00:43:24,199
<i>were divided into two groups:</i>

503
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:28,985
<i>one searched
all the estate's buildings,</i>

504
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:32,675
<i>the other combed the countryside.</i>

505
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:36,704
<i>Around 2.30 AM,
the siren sounded again</i>

506
00:43:36,842 --> 00:43:39,527
<i>calling the men back to the estate.</i>

507
00:43:40,277 --> 00:43:42,199
<i>Sigi had been found.</i>

508
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:48,052
<i>He was in the sawmill,
tied upside down.</i>

509
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:50,820
<i>His trousers were pulled down,</i>

510
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,876
<i>his buttocks
bleeding from cane strokes.</i>

511
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:58,342
<i>He was in a state of shock,
unable to walk.</i>

512
00:43:58,481 --> 00:44:00,275
<i>Lying on his belly,</i>

513
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:04,244
<i>he was carried home
on a makeshift stretcher.</i>

514
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:09,806
<i>Next Sunday, after the service,
the Baron asked the pastor</i>

515
00:44:09,985 --> 00:44:12,023
<i>to let him speak.</i>

516
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:16,702
City policemen questioned
many of you this week.

517
00:44:17,472 --> 00:44:18,873
To no avail.

518
00:44:20,612 --> 00:44:23,614
First I thought
my child was tortured

519
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:28,996
by those who cut off my cabbages.

520
00:44:29,221 --> 00:44:31,342
To get even!

521
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:33,307
For what?

522
00:44:34,884 --> 00:44:38,253
Supposedly it was my fault
their mother died in the sawmill,

523
00:44:38,398 --> 00:44:41,960
which is absurd.

524
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:44,748
At least, young Felder

525
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,422
told the police that was his motive
for his "mowing prowess".

526
00:44:51,409 --> 00:44:53,969
I've always helped
the Felder family.

527
00:44:55,115 --> 00:44:57,186
But people aren't always grateful.

528
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,579
It takes character.

529
00:45:00,793 --> 00:45:03,155
Don't run away, Felder!

530
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,543
It's your honor I want to salvage!

531
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:11,364
It turns out
the "valiant" Max Felder

532
00:45:12,202 --> 00:45:16,721
boasted of his feat to his fiancée.
Then the coward

533
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:18,853
hid among his family,

534
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:23,476
so he didn't have time
to torture my son.

535
00:45:23,818 --> 00:45:27,137
As to his father,
he'd bite off his tongue

536
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,429
rather than cover
for his wayward son.

537
00:45:35,228 --> 00:45:39,605
I'll remind you of a fact
that most of you may have forgotten.

538
00:45:41,126 --> 00:45:44,733
Two months ago, our doctor
had a riding accident,

539
00:45:44,887 --> 00:45:48,215
and is still not back from the hospital.

540
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:50,726
This accident was caused

541
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:53,389
by a wire strung in his garden,

542
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,963
with the explicit intent
of bringing him down.

543
00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:01,960
There, too, nobody knows,

544
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:04,168
saw or heard anything.

545
00:46:07,304 --> 00:46:10,751
We all know it:
those who injured my son,

546
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:13,286
and the doctor,

547
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:14,472
are here

548
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:16,342
among us,

549
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,105
in this room.

550
00:46:19,286 --> 00:46:22,487
I won't let such crimes
go unpunished,

551
00:46:23,503 --> 00:46:24,876
and hope nothing like that

552
00:46:24,936 --> 00:46:27,394
happens to any of your children.

553
00:46:29,016 --> 00:46:31,632
That's why I call upon you all:

554
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:35,824
help me find the culprit
or the culprits!

555
00:46:37,536 --> 00:46:39,630
If we fail to find out the truth,

556
00:46:40,224 --> 00:46:42,635
the peace of our community
will be gone.

557
00:46:43,806 --> 00:46:47,059
<i>The landowner's speech
frightened the locals.</i>

558
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,501
<i>The Baron wasn't popular,</i>

559
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:54,641
<i>but as a powerful figure
and employer of half the village,</i>

560
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:56,496
<i>he was respected.</i>

561
00:46:57,086 --> 00:46:59,545
<i>His statement
on the community's peace</i>

562
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:02,152
<i>was ominous.</i>

563
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,978
<i>And the mysterious character
of these criminal deeds</i>

564
00:47:07,445 --> 00:47:10,836
<i>awakened the old mistrust
of the farmers.</i>

565
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:27,804
Come in!

566
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:36,097
Eva!

567
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:39,329
May I come in?

568
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:42,847
What a question!
Of course, come in.

569
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:45,833
What's it about?

570
00:47:48,572 --> 00:47:49,673
What's wrong?

571
00:47:52,974 --> 00:47:54,735
They fired me.

572
00:47:56,264 --> 00:47:57,266
What do you mean?

573
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,936
Nothing. They just fired me.

574
00:48:02,114 --> 00:48:04,726
The tutor was also fired.

575
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:22,704
I don't know where to go.

576
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:26,094
I'm afraid on the road alone.

577
00:48:26,172 --> 00:48:28,356
Don't worry. Calm down.

578
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:30,847
Come, sit here.

579
00:48:32,155 --> 00:48:34,438
Calm down, tell me what happened.

580
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:40,126
Well?

581
00:48:41,943 --> 00:48:43,137
What happened?

582
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:49,996
The Baron's son isn't at all well.

583
00:48:51,394 --> 00:48:54,396
His parents are desperate and angry.

584
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:58,403
Now they say
the tutor and I are to blame,

585
00:48:58,827 --> 00:49:01,251
because we didn't pay
enough attention to him.

586
00:49:02,503 --> 00:49:04,789
But I'm only there for the twins.

587
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:10,456
I've always taken care of them
very well.

588
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,030
When you and I were dancing,

589
00:49:13,934 --> 00:49:16,431
the Baroness
had given me permission.

590
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:19,429
I haven't done anything wrong.

591
00:49:19,784 --> 00:49:22,094
I know, come on. Stop crying!

592
00:49:26,684 --> 00:49:28,300
Where can I go now?

593
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:31,427
My family needs my earnings.

594
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:33,708
You'll find something else.

595
00:49:33,778 --> 00:49:36,413
You know,
the Baron is quick-tempered.

596
00:49:36,753 --> 00:49:39,023
But his bark is worse than his bite.

597
00:49:39,155 --> 00:49:42,242
No, it's all over now, I know it.

598
00:49:43,693 --> 00:49:45,764
The Baroness doesn't want
to see anyone.

599
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:49,563
She wants to take the kids
with her, to town,

600
00:49:50,376 --> 00:49:52,489
or to her parents' estate.

601
00:49:54,432 --> 00:49:55,920
I'll try to talk to her.

602
00:49:57,197 --> 00:50:00,375
We used to play piano together,
four-handed.

603
00:50:01,056 --> 00:50:02,757
But I wasn't very good.

604
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:06,911
Now she's the tutor,
who studied the flute in town.

605
00:50:09,824 --> 00:50:11,855
He doesn't play that well.

606
00:50:12,273 --> 00:50:13,429
That's true.

607
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:25,184
Who does things like that?

608
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:27,380
What?

609
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:29,773
Beating a child like that.

610
00:50:31,085 --> 00:50:32,213
I don't know.

611
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:41,739
Can I stay here tonight?

612
00:50:43,268 --> 00:50:45,813
Don't send me away, sir, please.

613
00:50:46,403 --> 00:50:47,842
How could you think that?

614
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:52,800
I'll just wait for daybreak,
here in the classroom.

615
00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:54,987
Then I'll leave.

616
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:01,530
At home, they won't understand this.

617
00:51:03,987 --> 00:51:06,195
They'll think I did something wrong.

618
00:51:08,429 --> 00:51:09,972
Want me to come with you?

619
00:51:10,347 --> 00:51:11,373
What?

620
00:51:11,588 --> 00:51:13,188
Tomorrow, after school?

621
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:16,188
I'll find a carriage,
I'll be back by evening.

622
00:51:18,362 --> 00:51:20,117
Why would you do that, sir?

623
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,179
Stop being so formal.

624
00:51:26,594 --> 00:51:28,775
Why would you do that?

625
00:51:30,653 --> 00:51:32,735
Come here,
I'll play something for you.

626
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:35,079
If you want.

627
00:52:46,181 --> 00:52:47,501
Good morning, Father.

628
00:53:01,103 --> 00:53:02,125
I'm back again.

629
00:53:02,795 --> 00:53:03,833
They set me free.

630
00:53:04,143 --> 00:53:05,768
I can see that. So what?

631
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,172
Can you forgive me, Father?

632
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:32,197
Forgive you for what?

633
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:35,286
That the estate
won't give me any work?

634
00:53:35,965 --> 00:53:38,875
That Frieda was fired in disgrace?

635
00:53:39,315 --> 00:53:41,813
That your brothers and sisters
have nothing to eat?

636
00:53:42,182 --> 00:53:43,355
Or what?

637
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:48,411
<i>The next day, after school,
I went to the estate</i>

638
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:51,481
<i>to inquire about Sigi's health</i>

639
00:53:51,922 --> 00:53:55,282
<i>and to intercede
for Eva's reinstatement.</i>

640
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:56,753
<i>I was told</i>

641
00:53:57,038 --> 00:54:00,300
<i>the Baroness had left that morning
with her children.</i>

642
00:54:02,153 --> 00:54:06,639
<i>Reluctantly, the steward
lent me a carriage to take Eva home.</i>

643
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:11,092
<i>As we left the village,
we crossed the doctor.</i>

644
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:13,918
<i>A few days
after the Thanksgiving feast,</i>

645
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:18,103
<i>Rudolf, his four-year-old son,
had suddenly disappeared.</i>

646
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:22,855
<i>This upset everyone
in view of the previous events.</i>

647
00:54:23,634 --> 00:54:26,400
<i>The boy was finally found
on the main road,</i>

648
00:54:26,728 --> 00:54:28,903
<i>scantily dressed for a trip,</i>

649
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:32,164
<i>walking eagerly toward the town.</i>

650
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:34,621
<i>When asked where he was going,</i>

651
00:54:34,722 --> 00:54:37,492
<i>he said he wanted
to visit his father.</i>

652
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:42,469
<i>He fought tooth and nail
against being taken home.</i>

653
00:54:43,788 --> 00:54:46,248
<i>The doctor was told about this</i>

654
00:54:46,824 --> 00:54:50,257
<i>and, due to be released soon anyway,</i>

655
00:54:51,713 --> 00:54:54,976
<i>he decided to cut short his stay
at the hospital.</i>

656
00:54:58,349 --> 00:54:59,398
Rudi?

657
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:01,447
He was in the living room.

658
00:55:07,719 --> 00:55:08,822
What do I owe?

659
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:10,418
3.50 marks.

660
00:55:14,427 --> 00:55:15,510
Thanks.

661
00:55:15,556 --> 00:55:16,740
Have a nice day.

662
00:55:22,222 --> 00:55:23,851
Rudi, where are you?

663
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,420
Hello, Rudi.

664
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:10,653
Won't you say hello to your father?

665
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,027
No?

666
00:56:16,452 --> 00:56:17,690
I heard

667
00:56:18,161 --> 00:56:20,903
you wanted to visit me
at the hospital.

668
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,664
And now you lock yourself in?

669
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,394
All right.

670
00:56:33,231 --> 00:56:35,293
Then I don't want to see you.

671
00:56:36,452 --> 00:56:38,056
I'm going away now.

672
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:41,579
Stay in the toilet, if you want.

673
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,007
Keep well, Rudi.

674
00:58:10,722 --> 00:58:14,603
Your office is ready.
Mrs Wagner did it all.

675
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:18,730
- Why do you tell me that?
- I don't know.

676
00:58:19,949 --> 00:58:21,916
I thought you'd like to know.

677
00:58:23,094 --> 00:58:25,036
- She took good care of you?
- Yes.

678
00:58:33,954 --> 00:58:35,326
How old are you now?

679
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:37,396
14.

680
00:58:42,954 --> 00:58:44,121
It's amazing,

681
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:46,704
you look so like your mother.

682
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,405
... your mother and I
are very worried about you.

683
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,530
Think carefully. Do you sleep badly?

684
00:59:11,894 --> 00:59:13,385
Are you overtired?

685
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:14,668
No.

686
00:59:16,195 --> 00:59:19,657
Do you have problems at school
I don't know?

687
00:59:20,864 --> 00:59:22,001
No, Father.

688
00:59:26,527 --> 00:59:28,753
You don't understand why we worry.

689
00:59:29,367 --> 00:59:31,469
I'll explain it to you.

690
00:59:32,858 --> 00:59:36,393
As you know,
I'm also the pastor for Birkenbrunn.

691
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,577
One day, a mother came to see me,

692
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:43,853
as her son,
about the same age as you,

693
00:59:44,603 --> 00:59:46,172
had the same symptoms

694
00:59:48,135 --> 00:59:50,588
you've shown for some time.

695
00:59:50,981 --> 00:59:55,204
The boy suddenly seemed
extremely weary.

696
00:59:56,384 --> 01:00:00,019
His eyes were ringed,
he was depressed and joyless.

697
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:06,454
He avoided looking his parents
in the eye,

698
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:12,652
and soon was also caught lying.

699
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:25,797
This lasted about half a year.

700
01:00:26,945 --> 01:00:28,887
Then everything went very fast.

701
01:00:30,373 --> 01:00:32,139
He lost his appetite,

702
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:37,195
couldn't sleep any more,
his hands began to shake,

703
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:40,699
his memory started to fail,

704
01:00:41,989 --> 01:00:44,242
his face became
covered with pustules,

705
01:00:44,804 --> 01:00:46,282
then his whole body.

706
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:49,467
Finally, he died.

707
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:56,097
The body, that I had to bless,
looked like an old man's body.

708
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,380
Do you understand now
why I'm worried?

709
01:01:04,152 --> 01:01:06,753
What do you think
caused these changes

710
01:01:07,179 --> 01:01:10,793
that led
to that boy's miserable end?

711
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:12,931
I don't know.

712
01:01:15,498 --> 01:01:17,717
I think you know very well.

713
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:37,583
Won't you tell me?

714
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:41,000
No?

715
01:01:44,277 --> 01:01:46,891
Then I'll give you the answer.

716
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,277
The boy had seen someone,

717
01:01:51,657 --> 01:01:54,485
who was harming
the finest nerves of his body,

718
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:58,240
in the area where God
has erected sacred barriers.

719
01:01:59,271 --> 01:02:01,784
The boy imitated this action.

720
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:04,548
He couldn't stop doing it.

721
01:02:07,231 --> 01:02:11,445
In the end he destroyed
all his nerves, and died of it.

722
01:02:15,168 --> 01:02:16,750
I just want to help you.

723
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:19,954
I love you with all my heart.

724
01:02:21,286 --> 01:02:23,284
Be sincere, Martin.

725
01:02:24,186 --> 01:02:27,818
Why did you blush listening
to the story of the poor boy?

726
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:29,728
Blush?

727
01:02:30,192 --> 01:02:32,867
I don't know. I felt sorry for him.

728
01:02:34,101 --> 01:02:35,650
Is that all?

729
01:02:38,298 --> 01:02:40,949
I think there's another reason.

730
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:43,132
It's written on your face.

731
01:02:44,585 --> 01:02:46,291
Be sincere,

732
01:02:46,525 --> 01:02:47,695
Martin!

733
01:02:50,382 --> 01:02:51,996
Why are you crying?

734
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:55,114
Shall I spare you that confession?

735
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:00,523
Have you been doing
what that wretched boy did?

736
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:02,742
Yes.

737
01:03:18,257 --> 01:03:19,572
My arm!

738
01:03:51,596 --> 01:03:54,391
Glad that you're back. About time.

739
01:03:55,585 --> 01:03:57,239
One can say that. Yes.

740
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,427
It was hard with the children,
without you.

741
01:04:08,373 --> 01:04:09,583
I know.

742
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:17,717
He doesn't like me.

743
01:04:18,744 --> 01:04:20,474
- Who?
- Rudi.

744
01:04:22,503 --> 01:04:24,344
He's at a difficult age.

745
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,552
Actually not.

746
01:04:29,677 --> 01:04:31,844
They're always at a difficult age.

747
01:04:34,581 --> 01:04:35,599
Yes.

748
01:04:39,438 --> 01:04:41,070
You didn't miss me.

749
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:44,157
What does that mean?

750
01:04:45,972 --> 01:04:48,612
Nothing.
I said it because it's true.

751
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,262
Nothing like
a nice dose of self-hate!

752
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:58,083
What?

753
01:04:58,835 --> 01:05:01,023
Nothing. Forget it.

754
01:05:28,552 --> 01:05:31,103
<i>Winter came early that year.</i>

755
01:05:31,213 --> 01:05:34,869
<i>For Reformation Day,
on the first Sunday of November,</i>

756
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,751
<i>a blanket of snow
covered the village.</i>

757
01:05:38,784 --> 01:05:43,568
<i>Quite unusually, the Baron,
whose family had not yet come back,</i>

758
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:45,617
<i>didn't attend the service.</i>

759
01:05:47,336 --> 01:05:51,016
<i>The villagers took that
as a sign of his anger.</i>

760
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,653
<i>Indeed, no leads had been found</i>

761
01:05:53,735 --> 01:05:55,606
<i>to a possible culprit,</i>

762
01:05:56,025 --> 01:05:58,219
<i>although the Baron's appeal</i>

763
01:05:58,313 --> 01:06:00,507
<i>had led to a flood
of mutual suspicions,</i>

764
01:06:00,797 --> 01:06:04,275
<i>even to some attempts
at denunciation,</i>

765
01:06:05,717 --> 01:06:09,248
<i>that had all turned out
to be untenable.</i>

766
01:06:23,201 --> 01:06:25,119
Well, it's not pneumonia.

767
01:06:25,757 --> 01:06:27,244
But you must be careful.

768
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:30,293
If his temperature rises,
call me again.

769
01:06:30,815 --> 01:06:33,400
Give him these drops
every two hours.

770
01:06:34,108 --> 01:06:36,242
And hang wet sheets over the oven.

771
01:06:36,335 --> 01:06:38,070
That helps breathing.

772
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,702
- Good night to you.
- Good-bye, Doctor.

773
01:06:47,985 --> 01:06:49,815
How long was the window open?

774
01:06:50,804 --> 01:06:54,331
Hard to say.
My wife nursed him around 1 AM.

775
01:06:54,981 --> 01:06:56,668
She came back around 2:30 AM.

776
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,427
By then the room was icy cold.

777
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,534
And the baby didn't cry?

778
01:07:01,552 --> 01:07:03,456
No. The children heard nothing.

779
01:07:07,172 --> 01:07:09,606
He's doing all right.
We have to wait.

780
01:07:10,452 --> 01:07:12,617
But it looks fairly good.

781
01:07:13,177 --> 01:07:15,072
A drink to warm you up?

782
01:07:16,492 --> 01:07:18,190
Or stay for supper.

783
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:22,132
No, thanks. I'm overloaded,
I was away so long.

784
01:07:29,101 --> 01:07:31,186
How's your arm doing?

785
01:07:32,742 --> 01:07:33,994
It's all right.

786
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:37,478
It'll be fine
in two or three weeks.

787
01:07:37,871 --> 01:07:38,938
Thank you.

788
01:07:40,302 --> 01:07:42,021
That must be terrible, I imagine.

789
01:07:42,342 --> 01:07:45,300
One must be helpless
with only one arm.

790
01:07:45,693 --> 01:07:47,637
Quod erat demonstrandum.

791
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:52,385
Well, good night, children.

792
01:07:52,722 --> 01:07:53,978
Good night, Doctor.

793
01:07:54,342 --> 01:07:57,733
If your wife thinks
the baby's fever has risen again,

794
01:07:57,983 --> 01:07:59,217
let me know.

795
01:08:10,088 --> 01:08:11,429
Good...

796
01:08:13,161 --> 01:08:14,503
What do you mean "good"?

797
01:08:18,113 --> 01:08:19,596
I mean, that's fine.

798
01:08:27,247 --> 01:08:28,953
When did you go see Father?

799
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:31,377
Down in his office.

800
01:08:34,849 --> 01:08:35,926
Why?

801
01:08:37,663 --> 01:08:38,746
Just asking.

802
01:08:40,877 --> 01:08:44,537
<i>In mid-December,
I finally got a letter from Eva.</i>

803
01:08:45,828 --> 01:08:49,132
<i>Her father
had found her a job in town,</i>

804
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:52,542
<i>that she'd start early
in the New Year.</i>

805
01:08:53,895 --> 01:08:57,179
<i>Since the night she came
to shelter in the school,</i>

806
01:08:57,355 --> 01:08:59,421
<i>when until dawn,</i>

807
01:08:59,546 --> 01:09:03,158
<i>we told each other the story
of our short lives,</i>

808
01:09:04,087 --> 01:09:05,581
<i>her pale face,</i>

809
01:09:05,681 --> 01:09:09,280
<i>her shy but frank personality,</i>

810
01:09:10,047 --> 01:09:12,056
<i>were constantly on my mind.</i>

811
01:09:13,889 --> 01:09:17,457
<i>The school holidays
lasted until January 2nd,</i>

812
01:09:18,274 --> 01:09:20,927
<i>but already
on the day after Christmas,</i>

813
01:09:21,078 --> 01:09:23,332
<i>in the cold but sunny weather,</i>

814
01:09:24,171 --> 01:09:25,889
<i>I headed for Treglitz</i>

815
01:09:25,998 --> 01:09:28,701
<i>to visit Eva and her parents.</i>

816
01:09:29,555 --> 01:09:30,693
And Sigi?

817
01:09:32,632 --> 01:09:35,423
I don't know.
The Baroness isn't back yet.

818
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,002
And the Baron?

819
01:09:43,194 --> 01:09:46,162
We hardly see him.
He talks to nobody.

820
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:53,755
I don't know.
Some say they went to Italy.

821
01:09:53,988 --> 01:09:55,216
To Italy?

822
01:10:07,487 --> 01:10:11,229
The steward says they'll tear down
the sawmill. Because it's...

823
01:10:13,966 --> 01:10:15,105
Good morning.

824
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:16,577
Morning, young man.

825
01:10:16,907 --> 01:10:19,435
Please be seated.
We're not very formal here.

826
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:21,189
Scram!

827
01:10:36,913 --> 01:10:37,970
Care for a drink?

828
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,573
No, thanks. Very kind.

829
01:10:39,885 --> 01:10:41,706
- Really?
- No, thanks a lot.

830
01:10:47,082 --> 01:10:48,444
So you're a schoolteacher?

831
01:10:50,311 --> 01:10:52,359
Can you afford to have a wife?

832
01:10:53,599 --> 01:10:56,603
My father's a tailor at Vasendorf.
I've learned the trade.

833
01:10:56,766 --> 01:10:58,618
I earn money on the side.

834
01:10:59,497 --> 01:11:03,099
Taking over his business
would've been smarter.

835
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:13,479
And why are you so focused on Eva?

836
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:17,408
She's still a child.
You could be her father.

837
01:11:18,257 --> 01:11:19,376
I'm 31.

838
01:11:19,768 --> 01:11:21,676
Well, you're not far off.

839
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,149
Father!

840
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:32,512
Have you asked her
if she's interested?

841
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:36,213
She's a child,
knows nothing about life.

842
01:11:37,712 --> 01:11:40,056
Speak up. Do you want him?

843
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:44,073
Come on. Say something.

844
01:11:46,293 --> 01:11:48,057
He came all this way in the cold.

845
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:52,173
Leave her alone. Of course,
she wants him. Can't you tell?

846
01:11:52,597 --> 01:11:54,695
How can I, if she clams up!

847
01:12:04,257 --> 01:12:05,935
Sit down again.

848
01:12:08,689 --> 01:12:09,743
Women!

849
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:13,479
Don't take them too seriously.

850
01:12:16,269 --> 01:12:19,083
Listen, I'm not a big talker.

851
01:12:20,561 --> 01:12:23,194
On one hand, it suits mea
if she leaves the house.

852
01:12:23,569 --> 01:12:26,038
Lots of mouths to feed,
as you can see.

853
01:12:28,051 --> 01:12:29,442
On the other hand,

854
01:12:30,502 --> 01:12:33,028
it's moving too fast for me.

855
01:12:33,752 --> 01:12:35,215
I don't know you.

856
01:12:35,904 --> 01:12:39,145
I don't dislike you,
but I need to know more about you.

857
01:12:42,018 --> 01:12:46,515
The town hairdresser has agreed
to take her on as an apprentice.

858
01:12:47,721 --> 01:12:49,520
She'll get to meet people,

859
01:12:50,979 --> 01:12:53,051
she can decide
if she really wants this.

860
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:57,149
If in a year
she's still in favor of it,

861
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:58,951
we'll talk about it again.

862
01:13:01,064 --> 01:13:03,060
You can make up your mind too.

863
01:13:04,774 --> 01:13:05,886
All right?

864
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:08,541
- I actually thought I...
- Yes, I know.

865
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:13,096
But it's either that or nothing.

866
01:13:17,381 --> 01:13:18,621
If you insist...

867
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:20,247
Yes, I do.

868
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,654
Delighted.

869
01:13:31,438 --> 01:13:34,341
So, my work's waiting.

870
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:37,519
Even on holidays.

871
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:39,608
Don't get up.

872
01:13:41,011 --> 01:13:42,298
I'll send the kid back in.

873
01:13:46,777 --> 01:13:48,547
So you can say good bye.

874
01:13:48,943 --> 01:13:51,478
A year goes by fast.
The world won't collapse.

875
01:13:54,171 --> 01:13:55,663
You can come and visit her.

876
01:14:37,404 --> 01:14:38,940
Did your father tell you...?

877
01:14:50,197 --> 01:14:51,458
Is that all right with you?

878
01:14:54,805 --> 01:14:56,240
And is it with you, sir?

879
01:14:58,347 --> 01:15:00,057
Don't call me "sir".

880
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:27,221
Adi! Are you awake?

881
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:29,947
Adi!

882
01:15:31,371 --> 01:15:32,595
What is it?

883
01:15:32,712 --> 01:15:33,712
Look!

884
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,073
What's happening?

885
01:15:36,219 --> 01:15:38,632
Look! Go see what's happening!

886
01:15:40,114 --> 01:15:41,935
My God, what do you want?

887
01:15:42,327 --> 01:15:44,292
Over there! Look out the window!

888
01:15:55,832 --> 01:15:58,001
Something's burning! On the estate!

889
01:15:58,404 --> 01:15:59,655
Untie me!

890
01:16:00,194 --> 01:16:01,466
Come on, untie me!

891
01:16:02,341 --> 01:16:03,576
I don't know if...

892
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:04,894
Untie me, I said!

893
01:16:05,216 --> 01:16:06,740
What is it?

894
01:16:07,154 --> 01:16:08,266
Be quiet!

895
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:10,332
Gustl, come and untie me!

896
01:16:11,538 --> 01:16:12,975
What's going on?

897
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,457
Untie me, dammit!
There's a fire!

898
01:16:17,387 --> 01:16:19,233
What fire?

899
01:16:25,827 --> 01:16:27,113
A fire!

900
01:16:27,229 --> 01:16:29,733
Yes, a fire! Now untie me, dammit!

901
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:33,652
Father won't allow it.

902
01:16:34,033 --> 01:16:36,720
It's an emergency!
Somebody must warn them!

903
01:16:37,135 --> 01:16:38,135
Father!

904
01:16:38,331 --> 01:16:41,065
Stop shouting! I'll do it!

905
01:16:45,505 --> 01:16:47,231
Shall I call Mom?

906
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:54,114
- What is it?
- A fire!

907
01:16:54,463 --> 01:16:56,529
I know. Your father already went.

908
01:16:58,871 --> 01:17:00,429
What are you doing here?

909
01:17:00,912 --> 01:17:03,515
Go to bed now! It's nothing.

910
01:17:04,387 --> 01:17:07,305
There's a fire on the estate.
Don't be afraid.

911
01:17:07,853 --> 01:17:09,945
Go to bed and sleep.

912
01:17:12,175 --> 01:17:14,422
Go on! You'll catch a cold.

913
01:17:19,162 --> 01:17:21,532
Why all the noise?
You woke them all up!

914
01:17:21,927 --> 01:17:24,043
I thought it was dangerous.

915
01:17:24,453 --> 01:17:26,338
I had to untie him.

916
01:17:26,701 --> 01:17:28,421
Now everything's fine again.

917
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,521
Tomorrow,
Father will tell you about the fire.

918
01:17:32,073 --> 01:17:33,391
You all go back to bed.

919
01:17:34,377 --> 01:17:35,990
I'll wait till you're in bed.

920
01:17:37,292 --> 01:17:38,502
It's cold here.

921
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:52,378
Good night, then.

922
01:17:53,979 --> 01:17:55,193
Sleep tight.

923
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:56,948
Night, Mom!

924
01:20:00,559 --> 01:20:02,127
Why don't you stop doing that?

925
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:08,113
Why all the effort?

926
01:20:08,981 --> 01:20:11,266
Don't look so dumbfounded.

927
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,448
You don't lack talent.

928
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:16,082
I just can't do it
with you any more.

929
01:20:17,926 --> 01:20:20,216
To be truthful: you disgust me.

930
01:20:21,729 --> 01:20:23,132
Can't you finish your work?

931
01:20:23,457 --> 01:20:25,466
I don't want
to spend the night here.

932
01:20:31,012 --> 01:20:32,148
What did I do to you?

933
01:20:32,431 --> 01:20:34,899
My God, you've done nothing to me!

934
01:20:36,886 --> 01:20:38,877
You're ugly, messy,

935
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:42,248
flabby and have bad breath.
Will that do?

936
01:20:42,414 --> 01:20:47,828
The cover has to be sterilized.

937
01:20:48,095 --> 01:20:53,020
Don't sit there
looking like death warmed over.

938
01:20:53,659 --> 01:20:55,953
The world won't collapse.
Not on you,

939
01:20:56,087 --> 01:20:58,137
or on me.

940
01:21:02,296 --> 01:21:04,596
I can't go on with this, that's all.

941
01:21:07,788 --> 01:21:09,546
I've really tried...

942
01:21:11,309 --> 01:21:14,753
to think of another woman
while making love to you.

943
01:21:15,969 --> 01:21:17,715
One who smells good,

944
01:21:19,551 --> 01:21:21,823
who's young, less decrepit than you,

945
01:21:22,993 --> 01:21:25,351
but my imagination can't manage it.

946
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,494
In the end, it's you again

947
01:21:30,369 --> 01:21:32,490
and then I feel like puking,

948
01:21:33,644 --> 01:21:35,240
and am embarrassed at myself.

949
01:21:35,804 --> 01:21:36,909
So what's the point?

950
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:42,416
Are you through?

951
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:44,555
I have been for ages.

952
01:21:46,127 --> 01:21:48,435
You must be very unhappy
to be so mean.

953
01:21:48,798 --> 01:21:50,569
Please, not that routine!

954
01:21:53,854 --> 01:21:56,024
I know I'm not much to look at.

955
01:21:56,912 --> 01:22:00,502
My bad breath comes from my ulcer,
you know that.

956
01:22:01,854 --> 01:22:04,902
It didn't bother you in the past.

957
01:22:05,548 --> 01:22:07,800
I had it when your wife was alive.

958
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:10,823
Spare me these sordid details.

959
01:22:11,206 --> 01:22:14,292
Let me reassure you:
it always disgusted me.

960
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:19,234
After Julie's death,
I wanted to ease my pain

961
01:22:19,617 --> 01:22:22,684
with anyone.
I could have screwed a cow!

962
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:26,498
Whores are too far from here,

963
01:22:26,855 --> 01:22:29,449
and once every two months
isn't enough for me,

964
01:22:29,814 --> 01:22:31,939
even though I'm getting on.

965
01:22:32,659 --> 01:22:35,943
So skip acting like a martyr,
and scram.

966
01:22:38,337 --> 01:22:40,179
Why are you only noticing this now?

967
01:22:40,925 --> 01:22:44,024
When should I have noticed it?

968
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:49,137
At the hospital,
I forgot how tiresome you are.

969
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,908
One grows sentimental when in pain.

970
01:22:54,877 --> 01:22:57,390
Get out! Don't you have any pride?

971
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,069
There's no room for any with you.

972
01:23:03,081 --> 01:23:04,270
That's true.

973
01:23:07,113 --> 01:23:08,777
What if I do something silly?

974
01:23:10,576 --> 01:23:11,702
Go ahead.

975
01:23:12,212 --> 01:23:14,507
It'd surprise me. But be careful:

976
01:23:14,899 --> 01:23:16,534
it may be painful.

977
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,518
I know, I'm ridiculous.

978
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:23,444
You wouldn't care anyway.

979
01:23:23,779 --> 01:23:24,798
Well...

980
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:29,948
Why do you despise me?

981
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:33,650
For helping to raise the boy?

982
01:23:35,722 --> 01:23:38,166
For watching you
finger your daughter

983
01:23:38,421 --> 01:23:39,798
and saying nothing?

984
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,747
For helping you to deceive yourself?

985
01:23:45,904 --> 01:23:48,673
For listening to you
claim how you loved Julie,

986
01:23:48,828 --> 01:23:53,002
when everyone knew
you treated her as badly as me?

987
01:23:56,054 --> 01:23:59,256
For loving you,
when I know you can't stand

988
01:23:59,395 --> 01:24:00,595
being loved?

989
01:24:00,698 --> 01:24:01,826
That's it.

990
01:24:02,094 --> 01:24:04,350
Now get up. I have work to do.

991
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:08,851
You can't afford to get rid of me.

992
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:11,380
Who'll do the dirty work for you,

993
01:24:11,488 --> 01:24:14,417
who'll help you with the kids,
and your practice?

994
01:24:16,095 --> 01:24:17,761
You don't mean what you're saying.

995
01:24:18,166 --> 01:24:20,606
I want to see how far you can go:

996
01:24:20,943 --> 01:24:24,289
"Will she take it?
Can I drag her even lower?"

997
01:24:27,666 --> 01:24:29,050
I'm tired too.

998
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:32,626
I've got two retarded kids:
Karli and you.

999
01:24:33,051 --> 01:24:34,373
You're the most troublesome one.

1000
01:24:36,765 --> 01:24:38,966
My God, why don't you just die?

1001
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:19,042
<i>The year ended with fine weather.</i>

1002
01:26:19,962 --> 01:26:22,176
<i>The snowy landscape
sparkled so brightly</i>

1003
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,744
<i>that it hurt the eyes.</i>

1004
01:26:25,466 --> 01:26:26,609
<i>None of us suspected</i>

1005
01:26:27,007 --> 01:26:29,658
<i>it'd be our last New Year
in an era of peace,</i>

1006
01:26:29,805 --> 01:26:33,796
<i>and that this year
would bring a radical change,</i>

1007
01:26:34,203 --> 01:26:37,909
<i>of a magnitude we couldn't foresee.</i>

1008
01:26:40,953 --> 01:26:45,292
<i>Despite the strange events
that had unsettled the village,</i>

1009
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:49,006
<i>we thought of ourselves
as united in the belief</i>

1010
01:26:49,386 --> 01:26:53,314
<i>that life in our community
was God's will, and worth living.</i>

1011
01:26:53,828 --> 01:26:57,114
... Christ's body
as bread and as wine.

1012
01:26:58,743 --> 01:27:03,043
May the period of preparation
for your confirmation

1013
01:27:04,148 --> 01:27:05,610
be one of happiness

1014
01:27:06,411 --> 01:27:07,929
and enrichment.

1015
01:27:11,502 --> 01:27:13,545
You, Martin,

1016
01:27:14,654 --> 01:27:17,926
will now be free
not only of that ribbon,

1017
01:27:18,536 --> 01:27:22,192
but of those nightly ties

1018
01:27:22,524 --> 01:27:26,430
that kept you from yielding to
the temptations of your young body.

1019
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:34,838
I trust you, my beloved children,

1020
01:27:35,585 --> 01:27:38,375
and wish you
a profitable and happy new year.

1021
01:27:42,537 --> 01:27:44,967
<i>Shortly after Easter,
in the last week of April,</i>

1022
01:27:45,109 --> 01:27:47,707
<i>the Baroness came back
with the children.</i>

1023
01:27:48,112 --> 01:27:50,806
<i>She was accompanied by a new nanny.</i>

1024
01:27:51,943 --> 01:27:56,386
<i>My secret hope
that Eva could come back here,</i>

1025
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:58,505
<i>was definitely dashed.</i>

1026
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:02,730
<i>The new nanny was an Italian woman</i>

1027
01:28:02,896 --> 01:28:06,716
<i>who came from the area
on the Mediterranean coast</i>

1028
01:28:07,166 --> 01:28:10,051
<i>where the Baroness
had spent the winter.</i>

1029
01:28:10,297 --> 01:28:11,444
Sigi!

1030
01:28:13,654 --> 01:28:15,032
Hi, Ferdinand!

1031
01:28:15,547 --> 01:28:16,756
Wait!

1032
01:28:16,899 --> 01:28:18,445
I'll come down!

1033
01:28:20,564 --> 01:28:23,520
Stay here, Sigi!
You can see the boys later.

1034
01:28:23,648 --> 01:28:25,265
<i>Let him go, Madam.</i>

1035
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:27,658
<i>He's so happy to be back home!</i>

1036
01:28:27,974 --> 01:28:30,494
All right, go.
But don't be too long.

1037
01:28:56,563 --> 01:28:57,815
Marie-Luise?

1038
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:03,073
Where are you?

1039
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:35,332
Sigi!

1040
01:29:36,067 --> 01:29:38,117
<i>Won't you come say hello to your father?</i>

1041
01:29:57,141 --> 01:29:58,353
Watch out, he's coming!

1042
01:30:00,213 --> 01:30:01,617
Be quiet!

1043
01:30:02,298 --> 01:30:03,988
For God's sake! Be quiet!

1044
01:30:04,322 --> 01:30:05,360
Quiet!

1045
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:30,372
What's going on here?

1046
01:30:30,461 --> 01:30:31,997
Why are you still here?

1047
01:30:32,554 --> 01:30:34,849
There's a divinity class now!

1048
01:30:35,265 --> 01:30:36,355
Get going!

1049
01:30:37,845 --> 01:30:39,222
How about a good-bye?

1050
01:30:39,469 --> 01:30:41,158
Good bye, sir!

1051
01:30:47,425 --> 01:30:48,458
Good bye, Pastor!

1052
01:30:49,981 --> 01:30:51,890
I'm sorry, Pastor.
It won't happen again.

1053
01:30:55,878 --> 01:30:57,061
Good bye, Pastor.

1054
01:30:57,948 --> 01:30:59,127
Good bye.

1055
01:31:03,787 --> 01:31:05,311
Let us pray.

1056
01:31:07,381 --> 01:31:09,430
Our Father, who art in heaven

1057
01:31:10,283 --> 01:31:12,088
hallowed by Thy name,

1058
01:31:12,756 --> 01:31:15,569
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

1059
01:31:16,082 --> 01:31:18,768
on earth as it is in Heaven.

1060
01:31:19,779 --> 01:31:22,422
Give us this day our daily bread

1061
01:31:22,842 --> 01:31:24,957
and forgive us our trespasses

1062
01:31:25,317 --> 01:31:28,471
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1063
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,743
And lead us not into temptation

1064
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:33,672
but deliver us from evil

1065
01:31:34,046 --> 01:31:36,801
for Thine is the kingdom, the power

1066
01:31:37,489 --> 01:31:38,636
and the glory

1067
01:31:38,721 --> 01:31:40,439
for ever and ever.

1068
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:41,868
Amen.

1069
01:31:43,711 --> 01:31:45,095
Sit down.

1070
01:31:58,681 --> 01:32:01,069
This is a very sad day for me.

1071
01:32:03,125 --> 01:32:07,190
In a few weeks, we all want
to celebrate your confirmation.

1072
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:11,649
For months I've tried
to bring God's word closer to you,

1073
01:32:12,057 --> 01:32:17,110
and make responsible
human beings out of you.

1074
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:21,451
Who do I face today?

1075
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:24,534
Yelling monkeys,

1076
01:32:25,896 --> 01:32:29,944
undisciplined, as childish
as your 7-year-old classmates!

1077
01:32:33,206 --> 01:32:34,485
But to me,

1078
01:32:35,215 --> 01:32:37,073
what is even sadder

1079
01:32:38,735 --> 01:32:40,345
is that my own daughter

1080
01:32:40,452 --> 01:32:43,542
plays the leading role
in this pitiful display.

1081
01:32:46,326 --> 01:32:49,237
Last year

1082
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:52,265
I tied a white ribbon in her hair.

1083
01:32:54,373 --> 01:32:56,077
White, as you all know,

1084
01:32:56,414 --> 01:32:57,978
is the color of innocence.

1085
01:32:59,055 --> 01:33:02,186
The ribbon was meant
to help Klara avoid sin,

1086
01:33:03,824 --> 01:33:05,226
selfishness,

1087
01:33:05,323 --> 01:33:06,614
envy,

1088
01:33:07,619 --> 01:33:10,708
indecency, lies and sloth.

1089
01:33:13,072 --> 01:33:14,863
At the start of the year,

1090
01:33:16,279 --> 01:33:17,564
I naďvely believed

1091
01:33:17,909 --> 01:33:20,939
that she was now mature enough

1092
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:23,948
not to need that ribbon any more.

1093
01:33:25,587 --> 01:33:27,828
That she'd become
responsible enough,

1094
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:30,405
as the daughter
of the spiritual leader of...

1095
01:33:40,189 --> 01:33:41,476
Anni?

1096
01:33:58,698 --> 01:34:00,953
Anni? Where are you?

1097
01:34:38,256 --> 01:34:39,256
Anni?

1098
01:35:23,787 --> 01:35:26,087
Rudi? What are you doing here?

1099
01:35:27,194 --> 01:35:28,826
Why aren't you in bed?

1100
01:35:29,106 --> 01:35:31,551
I can't go to sleep.

1101
01:35:32,207 --> 01:35:34,413
Is that why you're wandering around?

1102
01:35:34,716 --> 01:35:37,381
I woke up and you weren't there.

1103
01:35:41,184 --> 01:35:43,823
Dad has pierced my earlobes.

1104
01:35:44,448 --> 01:35:46,131
Does it hurt?

1105
01:35:47,515 --> 01:35:48,770
Yes, a bit.

1106
01:35:48,859 --> 01:35:50,974
Is that why you're crying?

1107
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:52,837
I'm not crying any more.

1108
01:35:56,033 --> 01:35:57,730
Beauty has to suffer.

1109
01:36:01,046 --> 01:36:02,695
That's what they say.

1110
01:36:11,043 --> 01:36:12,364
Go back to bed.

1111
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:14,659
Anni's coming.

1112
01:36:21,176 --> 01:36:24,989
I haven't worn earrings in ages,
so the holes closed up.

1113
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:32,274
For Whitsun,

1114
01:36:32,904 --> 01:36:34,654
I'm getting Mom's.

1115
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:37,695
The pretty ones,

1116
01:36:38,634 --> 01:36:39,634
you know?

1117
01:37:23,594 --> 01:37:26,595
<i>A few days
after Klara's fainting fit,</i>

1118
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,360
<i>that frightened us all,</i>

1119
01:37:28,465 --> 01:37:32,137
<i>and left her feverish and weakened,</i>

1120
01:37:32,989 --> 01:37:35,970
<i>I went to see the steward,
on the eve of Whitsun</i>

1121
01:37:36,132 --> 01:37:38,631
<i>to borrow the carriage again.</i>

1122
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:43,542
<i>Since my marriage proposal,
Eva wrote me once a week.</i>

1123
01:37:43,989 --> 01:37:48,188
<i>I felt she was alone
and lost in the city,</i>

1124
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:53,125
<i>and was hinting for me
to come see her as soon as I could.</i>

1125
01:37:54,131 --> 01:37:56,559
<i>I wanted to spend Saturday with her</i>

1126
01:37:56,698 --> 01:37:58,596
<i>and be back on Sunday</i>

1127
01:37:58,715 --> 01:38:02,474
<i>to prepare the confirmation ceremony
with the pastor.</i>

1128
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:06,429
<i>The steward had gone to the sawmill,</i>

1129
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:09,567
<i>but was due back any minute.</i>

1130
01:38:35,462 --> 01:38:36,706
Good morning, sir.

1131
01:38:36,796 --> 01:38:38,135
Hello, Erna.

1132
01:38:47,997 --> 01:38:49,261
He's cute.

1133
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:52,335
Do you like him?

1134
01:38:52,644 --> 01:38:53,742
Yes. Very much.

1135
01:38:58,042 --> 01:39:00,216
He was quite sick last winter,
I was told.

1136
01:39:00,872 --> 01:39:02,208
Yes. Very sick.

1137
01:39:02,865 --> 01:39:06,155
But the doctor cured him, thank God.

1138
01:39:07,832 --> 01:39:09,512
Maybe I'll come back this evening.

1139
01:39:09,949 --> 01:39:11,921
I'm sure Father will come for coffee

1140
01:39:12,041 --> 01:39:13,155
at four.

1141
01:39:14,533 --> 01:39:15,913
Then I'll sit down again.

1142
01:39:16,289 --> 01:39:18,719
Can I get you something? A coffee?

1143
01:39:19,061 --> 01:39:20,520
It must be ready.

1144
01:39:20,898 --> 01:39:24,207
No, thanks.
I'll just sit and wait.

1145
01:39:24,385 --> 01:39:25,582
Sir!

1146
01:39:29,739 --> 01:39:32,333
Can dreams come true?

1147
01:39:34,744 --> 01:39:35,884
That depends.

1148
01:39:36,145 --> 01:39:37,314
On what?

1149
01:39:38,118 --> 01:39:39,515
On what does it depend?

1150
01:39:41,065 --> 01:39:44,703
If you dream of being
first in your class, and study hard,

1151
01:39:45,345 --> 01:39:47,100
your dream may come true.

1152
01:39:47,488 --> 01:39:49,761
- I didn't mean that.
- Then what?

1153
01:39:51,545 --> 01:39:53,963
I mean, if you dream of something,

1154
01:39:54,563 --> 01:39:56,515
really dream it in your sleep,

1155
01:39:56,914 --> 01:39:59,020
can it come true?

1156
01:40:00,288 --> 01:40:01,966
Why, what did you dream?

1157
01:40:06,055 --> 01:40:07,090
Tell me.

1158
01:40:08,019 --> 01:40:09,724
You have something on your mind.

1159
01:40:12,167 --> 01:40:13,511
So tell me.

1160
01:40:15,632 --> 01:40:17,582
I dreamt that Karli...

1161
01:40:18,725 --> 01:40:20,819
- the odd little boy of the...
- I know.

1162
01:40:21,627 --> 01:40:23,340
Something terrible
will happen to him.

1163
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:25,604
Something terrible?

1164
01:40:26,710 --> 01:40:28,047
Like what?

1165
01:40:29,292 --> 01:40:30,721
I don't know.

1166
01:40:31,457 --> 01:40:33,382
Like what happened to Sigi.

1167
01:40:34,853 --> 01:40:35,951
But even worse.

1168
01:40:36,757 --> 01:40:39,756
But he's so sweet. He harms no one.

1169
01:40:40,158 --> 01:40:41,490
Come on...

1170
01:40:43,125 --> 01:40:46,291
It was only a dream.
Don't take it so seriously.

1171
01:40:55,778 --> 01:40:58,810
Dreams don't come true.
Let alone that kind.

1172
01:41:03,216 --> 01:41:05,947
But sometimes
my dreams do come true.

1173
01:41:06,554 --> 01:41:07,840
What do you mean?

1174
01:41:12,407 --> 01:41:13,634
Last winter,

1175
01:41:13,872 --> 01:41:16,386
before Gustl got sick,

1176
01:41:16,762 --> 01:41:20,091
I dreamt
my brother opened his window,

1177
01:41:20,429 --> 01:41:22,149
so he'd die.

1178
01:41:22,432 --> 01:41:26,162
And his window was opened,
he caught a chill, almost died.

1179
01:41:28,993 --> 01:41:30,577
What are you saying?

1180
01:41:30,966 --> 01:41:32,275
That's nonsense!

1181
01:41:53,521 --> 01:41:56,681
<i>We arranged to meet
at the railway station,</i>

1182
01:41:57,140 --> 01:42:00,367
<i>as Eva wanted to avoid
being seen with me.</i>

1183
01:42:01,061 --> 01:42:03,716
<i>She was living with distant cousins,</i>

1184
01:42:04,172 --> 01:42:05,944
<i>who gave her parents</i>

1185
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:09,729
<i>regular reports on her behavior.</i>

1186
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:13,780
<i>She had become thinner,
which made her even prettier.</i>

1187
01:42:14,645 --> 01:42:17,246
<i>I was ravished again
by her mixture of shyness</i>

1188
01:42:17,393 --> 01:42:19,824
<i>and almost childlike outspokenness.</i>

1189
01:42:20,684 --> 01:42:22,355
So it's not really so awful?

1190
01:42:22,698 --> 01:42:25,393
No. But sweeping up hair all day...

1191
01:42:25,811 --> 01:42:27,220
The twins were more fun.

1192
01:42:27,533 --> 01:42:31,104
But it's all right.
I can't really complain.

1193
01:42:31,317 --> 01:42:32,332
No?

1194
01:42:32,413 --> 01:42:33,489
No.

1195
01:42:33,822 --> 01:42:34,885
Really.

1196
01:42:37,561 --> 01:42:39,622
Aside from the twins,
you miss nothing?

1197
01:42:42,095 --> 01:42:43,550
Come on, you!

1198
01:43:02,975 --> 01:43:05,256
How is the nanny? She only speaks Italian?

1199
01:43:05,676 --> 01:43:07,349
That's what the steward says.

1200
01:43:07,576 --> 01:43:08,721
I see.

1201
01:43:16,787 --> 01:43:18,373
Where are you going?

1202
01:43:18,697 --> 01:43:21,344
There's a nice little pond
in the wood.

1203
01:43:21,827 --> 01:43:24,546
We can picnic there.
I brought some food.

1204
01:43:27,229 --> 01:43:29,327
- I'd rather not.
- Why?

1205
01:43:34,225 --> 01:43:35,426
What is it?

1206
01:43:36,332 --> 01:43:37,377
Nothing.

1207
01:43:38,458 --> 01:43:39,726
Please.

1208
01:43:42,345 --> 01:43:44,479
I had no improper intentions.

1209
01:43:44,863 --> 01:43:47,275
I just wanted you
to enjoy the picnic.

1210
01:43:50,279 --> 01:43:51,481
Please.

1211
01:43:53,144 --> 01:43:56,019
How could I disgrace my future wife?

1212
01:44:01,230 --> 01:44:02,557
All right then.

1213
01:44:02,711 --> 01:44:04,091
I'll turn around.

1214
01:44:17,725 --> 01:44:18,980
Thanks.

1215
01:44:49,453 --> 01:44:51,177
Accept and drink!

1216
01:44:52,332 --> 01:44:54,686
This is the blood
of the New Testament,

1217
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:56,752
shed for you

1218
01:44:57,091 --> 01:44:58,988
to forgive your sins.

1219
01:46:29,152 --> 01:46:30,494
Here! He's here!

1220
01:46:39,337 --> 01:46:40,578
Out of the way!

1221
01:46:54,082 --> 01:46:55,926
"For I, the Lord, your God

1222
01:46:56,077 --> 01:46:57,613
"am a jealous God

1223
01:46:58,634 --> 01:47:03,127
"visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children

1224
01:47:03,538 --> 01:47:06,282
unto the third
and fourth generation."

1225
01:47:07,368 --> 01:47:10,639
<i>After the atrocities committed
on the retarded boy,</i>

1226
01:47:11,103 --> 01:47:14,088
<i>the Baron was finally convinced
it was smarter</i>

1227
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:19,125
<i>to enlist the help
of the county's police force.</i>

1228
01:47:19,887 --> 01:47:21,367
<i>So a few days later</i>

1229
01:47:21,661 --> 01:47:24,377
<i>two plainclothes policemen arrived,</i>

1230
01:47:24,831 --> 01:47:27,838
<i>who, after visiting
several of the crime scenes,</i>

1231
01:47:28,246 --> 01:47:31,524
<i>inquired if anyone
had noticed anything suspicious.</i>

1232
01:47:32,740 --> 01:47:35,917
<i>When I learnt of Karli's torture,</i>

1233
01:47:36,247 --> 01:47:40,012
<i>I didn't think
of what Erna had told me.</i>

1234
01:47:40,462 --> 01:47:44,744
<i>When I remembered,
I hesitated to tell the authorities.</i>

1235
01:47:45,182 --> 01:47:49,091
<i>Such an absurd coincidence
might jeopardize</i>

1236
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:52,850
<i>the reputation and inner peace
of the steward's family.</i>

1237
01:47:53,823 --> 01:47:58,780
<i>But when I heard that Karli
might lose his eyesight,</i>

1238
01:47:59,252 --> 01:48:01,765
<i>I made Erna come to the school</i>

1239
01:48:02,204 --> 01:48:04,707
<i>and tell the policemen
about her dream.</i>

1240
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:07,126
... we're not as stupid as you think.

1241
01:48:07,527 --> 01:48:09,666
But I really dreamt it!

1242
01:48:14,728 --> 01:48:16,091
Watch out!

1243
01:48:18,354 --> 01:48:19,912
I'll give you one last chance:

1244
01:48:21,697 --> 01:48:25,216
tell us who told you
of a plan to torture the boy,

1245
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:28,280
and we won't repeat it to anyone.

1246
01:48:28,613 --> 01:48:29,643
All right?

1247
01:48:34,118 --> 01:48:36,007
She's already had dreams
that came true.

1248
01:48:36,936 --> 01:48:38,109
Is that so?

1249
01:48:38,917 --> 01:48:40,145
About what, may I ask?

1250
01:48:41,939 --> 01:48:44,037
It was a family matter.

1251
01:48:44,612 --> 01:48:46,699
I see! A family matter.

1252
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:48,970
You checked if it was true?

1253
01:48:49,287 --> 01:48:50,313
No.

1254
01:48:52,631 --> 01:48:53,676
Well,

1255
01:48:55,012 --> 01:48:56,216
it may be true.

1256
01:48:57,523 --> 01:48:59,957
Maybe she's
an authentic clairvoyant,

1257
01:49:00,435 --> 01:49:02,478
and we're luckier than we think.

1258
01:49:03,527 --> 01:49:04,837
Stop crying!

1259
01:49:07,545 --> 01:49:10,599
Your deceitful whining
won't work with me.

1260
01:49:11,024 --> 01:49:13,550
I've got other ways
to make you talk.

1261
01:49:14,667 --> 01:49:17,228
I don't believe in witches
and sorcerers,

1262
01:49:17,615 --> 01:49:21,610
even less in the hallucinations
of a brat like you.

1263
01:49:23,052 --> 01:49:25,238
So make up your mind
to tell me the truth.

1264
01:49:25,583 --> 01:49:28,279
I won't let go till you come clean.
Got that?

1265
01:49:30,292 --> 01:49:32,845
Now let's go see
what your parents think

1266
01:49:33,229 --> 01:49:35,673
of your version of the story.

1267
01:49:36,587 --> 01:49:38,358
Can you come with us?

1268
01:49:38,716 --> 01:49:39,863
Of course.

1269
01:49:42,189 --> 01:49:43,372
Hello, there!

1270
01:49:44,128 --> 01:49:45,356
Who do we have here?

1271
01:49:45,935 --> 01:49:47,154
Good afternoon.

1272
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,630
Good afternoon, sir.

1273
01:49:50,551 --> 01:49:52,213
Why do you eavesdrop?

1274
01:49:52,524 --> 01:49:56,497
We saw the teacher had visitors.
We didn't want to intrude.

1275
01:49:56,972 --> 01:49:59,393
We were waiting to talk to him.

1276
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:00,912
What do you want?

1277
01:50:02,235 --> 01:50:03,979
To ask you about Karli.

1278
01:50:04,252 --> 01:50:05,350
Like what?

1279
01:50:06,606 --> 01:50:08,417
We heard he isn't well.

1280
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:11,240
We wondered if we could help.

1281
01:50:14,564 --> 01:50:15,697
You'll be all right...

1282
01:50:23,528 --> 01:50:25,074
I know, it hurts.

1283
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:37,649
Be patient...

1284
01:50:45,981 --> 01:50:47,578
Everything will be fine again.

1285
01:50:48,438 --> 01:50:49,877
It'll be fine.

1286
01:51:00,944 --> 01:51:02,590
I have to go now, Karli.

1287
01:51:04,625 --> 01:51:06,207
Don't worry.

1288
01:51:07,668 --> 01:51:09,063
I'll be back tomorrow.

1289
01:51:13,777 --> 01:51:15,907
You'll be all right.
Don't be afraid.

1290
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:17,649
The doctor will be back.

1291
01:53:16,609 --> 01:53:17,791
Come in!

1292
01:53:27,421 --> 01:53:28,528
Yes?

1293
01:53:45,342 --> 01:53:46,431
What is it?

1294
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:50,396
To replace Piepsi.

1295
01:53:51,171 --> 01:53:53,878
Because you're so sad.

1296
01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:02,493
Thank you.

1297
01:54:05,443 --> 01:54:07,065
You're welcome, Father.

1298
01:54:58,003 --> 01:55:00,042
- Give me the whistle!
- Sorry?

1299
01:55:00,423 --> 01:55:02,337
The whistle!

1300
01:55:02,761 --> 01:55:04,360
What whistle?

1301
01:55:05,268 --> 01:55:06,434
Give it to me!

1302
01:55:07,007 --> 01:55:08,394
What whistle?

1303
01:55:10,998 --> 01:55:12,609
Give it, or I'll kill you.

1304
01:55:12,961 --> 01:55:14,880
I have no whistle.

1305
01:55:16,381 --> 01:55:18,248
Bastard!

1306
01:55:18,664 --> 01:55:20,301
Wretch!

1307
01:55:20,604 --> 01:55:21,944
For God's sake,

1308
01:55:22,662 --> 01:55:24,002
what's got into you?

1309
01:55:24,622 --> 01:55:25,774
What has he done?

1310
01:55:26,832 --> 01:55:30,635
For the last time, give it to me!

1311
01:55:31,043 --> 01:55:32,435
Give you what, Father?

1312
01:55:32,764 --> 01:55:33,886
What is it?

1313
01:55:34,341 --> 01:55:35,845
What are you talking about?

1314
01:55:37,015 --> 01:55:38,613
You know what I mean!

1315
01:55:39,753 --> 01:55:42,020
But if he says so!
What's going on?

1316
01:55:48,372 --> 01:55:49,890
Please wait!

1317
01:55:51,221 --> 01:55:52,841
What did the boy do?

1318
01:55:53,190 --> 01:55:54,734
Calm down.

1319
01:55:55,608 --> 01:55:59,163
Stay out of it!
I have to go back to the Baron.

1320
01:56:17,582 --> 01:56:20,393
Georg! Please, don't!

1321
01:56:20,913 --> 01:56:22,796
You'll kill him!

1322
01:56:23,934 --> 01:56:27,301
... with the birch-trees in Retenow,
it'll be 6,000 cubic meters.

1323
01:56:28,422 --> 01:56:31,292
It'll take them around three weeks.

1324
01:56:33,948 --> 01:56:36,585
And now we have 80 extra Poles.

1325
01:56:37,435 --> 01:56:39,621
They've been put up in the annex.

1326
01:56:40,021 --> 01:56:42,126
We're all out of bedding.

1327
01:56:43,738 --> 01:56:45,279
It takes time.

1328
01:56:46,987 --> 01:56:48,802
There are lots of kids with them.

1329
01:56:49,751 --> 01:56:51,117
In spite of it...

1330
01:56:51,211 --> 01:56:52,787
I won't stay here.

1331
01:56:53,453 --> 01:56:54,608
What?

1332
01:56:55,481 --> 01:56:56,960
I won't stay here.

1333
01:57:01,733 --> 01:57:02,935
What does that mean?

1334
01:57:03,543 --> 01:57:05,685
That I'm leaving with the children.

1335
01:57:06,931 --> 01:57:08,247
What do you mean?

1336
01:57:08,594 --> 01:57:10,921
Armin!
That's not so hard to understand.

1337
01:57:14,806 --> 01:57:16,055
How do you plan to do all this?

1338
01:57:17,877 --> 01:57:19,359
I don't know yet.

1339
01:57:20,217 --> 01:57:22,836
But in any case,
we're leaving this place.

1340
01:57:23,043 --> 01:57:24,146
"We"?

1341
01:57:25,445 --> 01:57:26,453
Yes.

1342
01:57:45,650 --> 01:57:46,957
That'll be all, thank you.

1343
01:57:47,288 --> 01:57:49,148
Good night, Baroness and Baron.

1344
01:58:05,726 --> 01:58:08,684
I only came back
out of fairness to you.

1345
01:58:12,621 --> 01:58:14,346
To give us a chance.

1346
01:58:18,916 --> 01:58:21,006
You gave me a chance?

1347
01:58:23,250 --> 01:58:25,832
Wonderful! And I missed my chance?

1348
01:58:27,015 --> 01:58:29,614
Will that help us
to solve the problem?

1349
01:58:29,979 --> 01:58:31,114
What?

1350
01:58:31,164 --> 01:58:32,506
Your sarcasm.

1351
01:58:32,637 --> 01:58:35,478
What is the problem
we have to solve?

1352
01:58:39,051 --> 01:58:40,335
You stay here!

1353
01:58:44,552 --> 01:58:46,551
You'll only leave when I say so.

1354
01:58:55,905 --> 01:58:57,171
Fine.

1355
01:59:07,786 --> 01:59:10,207
I was hoping to spare you this.

1356
01:59:14,331 --> 01:59:17,569
At Uncle Edoardo's
I fell in love with a man.

1357
01:59:19,577 --> 01:59:21,283
He's from Lombardy

1358
01:59:21,594 --> 01:59:25,314
and is a banker who advised
Uncle Edoardo financially.

1359
01:59:27,715 --> 01:59:29,360
He courted me assiduously

1360
01:59:30,429 --> 01:59:32,699
and was very fond of the children.

1361
01:59:35,122 --> 01:59:38,434
It was thanks to him
that Sigi has blossomed.

1362
01:59:42,743 --> 01:59:44,725
Despite this, we came back.

1363
01:59:46,279 --> 01:59:48,221
Because I felt committed to you.

1364
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:53,641
But I can't stand this place
any longer.

1365
01:59:54,784 --> 01:59:56,560
Not so much personally,

1366
01:59:57,333 --> 01:59:59,814
though life with you

1367
01:59:59,921 --> 02:00:02,402
isn't thrilling
for a woman of my age.

1368
02:00:05,525 --> 02:00:09,222
I'm leaving so the children
don't grow up in surroundings

1369
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:12,431
that are dominated by malice,

1370
02:00:13,729 --> 02:00:14,872
envy,

1371
02:00:15,563 --> 02:00:18,118
apathy and brutality.

1372
02:00:22,122 --> 02:00:25,060
Sigi's whistle was the last straw.

1373
02:00:28,309 --> 02:00:30,216
I'm sick and tired of persecutions,

1374
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:33,666
threats
and perverse acts of revenge.

1375
02:00:40,305 --> 02:00:41,783
Did you sleep with him?

1376
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:45,960
You don't understand anything.

1377
02:00:46,672 --> 02:00:48,286
Did you sleep with him?

1378
02:00:54,475 --> 02:00:56,105
No. I didn't sleep with him.

1379
02:00:58,576 --> 02:01:00,694
You're lying, right?

1380
02:01:08,587 --> 02:01:09,587
Come in!

1381
02:01:12,608 --> 02:01:13,880
Good evening.

1382
02:01:15,505 --> 02:01:16,668
Good evening, Baroness.

1383
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:19,594
- Can I talk to you?
- Can't it wait?

1384
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:23,016
No, or I wouldn't have
disturbed you so late.

1385
02:02:39,324 --> 02:02:40,479
What is it?

1386
02:02:42,613 --> 02:02:45,612
They've assassinated
Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo.

1387
02:02:48,216 --> 02:02:51,432
<i>The news spread around the village
like wildfire.</i>

1388
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:54,337
<i>What would the consequences be?</i>

1389
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:58,661
<i>The first who said "war",
was severely contradicted.</i>

1390
02:03:00,010 --> 02:03:02,335
<i>But once the word had been uttered,</i>

1391
02:03:02,676 --> 02:03:06,908
<i>it remained stubbornly
at the center of all our thoughts.</i>

1392
02:03:08,908 --> 02:03:12,573
<i>I wanted to go to town quickly
to discuss with Eva</i>

1393
02:03:12,948 --> 02:03:16,140
<i>what we should do
if war broke out.</i>

1394
02:03:16,952 --> 02:03:20,672
<i>Maybe her father would now agreed
to an earlier marriage.</i>

1395
02:03:22,759 --> 02:03:24,792
<i>I asked the Baroness for the bicycle</i>

1396
02:03:25,029 --> 02:03:27,586
<i>that Eva had borrowed previously.</i>

1397
02:03:28,530 --> 02:03:32,458
<i>I planned to use it
to visit her Sunday.</i>

1398
02:03:34,594 --> 02:03:38,636
<i>Friday when I went to pick up
the bicycle,</i>

1399
02:03:39,277 --> 02:03:42,533
<i>I witnessed a strange confrontation.</i>

1400
02:03:54,461 --> 02:03:56,064
What is it, Mrs Wagner?

1401
02:03:58,109 --> 02:03:59,390
Can I borrow your bicycle?

1402
02:03:59,704 --> 02:04:02,360
- It's not mine.
- Can I borrow it anyway?

1403
02:04:02,779 --> 02:04:05,926
I just borrowed it myself.
To visit my fiancée.

1404
02:04:06,328 --> 02:04:07,625
Please!

1405
02:04:08,085 --> 02:04:09,962
Where do you want to go?

1406
02:04:10,362 --> 02:04:11,739
- To town.
- What for?

1407
02:04:12,054 --> 02:04:16,123
The stubborn steward
won't lend me a carriage.

1408
02:04:17,114 --> 02:04:18,872
Please lend it to me.

1409
02:04:19,206 --> 02:04:20,849
Why? What for?

1410
02:04:21,273 --> 02:04:24,551
To go to the police.
I know who committed those crimes.

1411
02:04:24,807 --> 02:04:25,948
Who?

1412
02:04:26,863 --> 02:04:28,202
Can I have the bicycle?

1413
02:04:29,113 --> 02:04:30,530
Why not tell me?

1414
02:04:30,818 --> 02:04:34,216
I'll only talk to the police.
I'm sick of insults.

1415
02:04:36,154 --> 02:04:38,002
What about the doctor's horse?

1416
02:04:38,314 --> 02:04:39,942
I don't know how to ride.

1417
02:04:42,328 --> 02:04:45,103
Please! Believe me!

1418
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:48,177
My son told me who did it to him.

1419
02:04:49,887 --> 02:04:51,529
He may lose his eyesight.

1420
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:54,094
Lend it to me!

1421
02:04:57,606 --> 02:04:58,720
Thanks!

1422
02:05:02,404 --> 02:05:05,886
<i>I was so sorry that I gave in.</i>

1423
02:05:06,569 --> 02:05:08,817
<i>But the state of that woman,</i>

1424
02:05:08,914 --> 02:05:11,162
<i>usually so level headed, upset me.</i>

1425
02:05:12,016 --> 02:05:16,011
<i>What had she found out
that she didn't dare tell?</i>

1426
02:05:17,475 --> 02:05:20,820
<i>Back in the village,
I decided to investigate.</i>

1427
02:05:33,047 --> 02:05:34,231
Hello, sir.

1428
02:05:34,868 --> 02:05:36,032
Hello, Klara.

1429
02:05:38,551 --> 02:05:39,796
What are you doing here?

1430
02:05:42,270 --> 02:05:44,091
We wanted to see how Karli was.

1431
02:05:44,207 --> 02:05:47,470
Can't you see it's closed up?

1432
02:05:48,228 --> 02:05:49,951
Yes. We were worried.

1433
02:05:50,463 --> 02:05:53,444
We saw Mrs Wagner
bicycling off.

1434
02:05:54,414 --> 02:05:56,490
We wondered
what had happened to Karli.

1435
02:06:00,547 --> 02:06:02,828
Go home.
You don't belong in here.

1436
02:06:17,514 --> 02:06:19,188
Go on home.

1437
02:06:20,485 --> 02:06:21,646
Good bye, teacher.

1438
02:06:28,807 --> 02:06:33,305
<i>I wondered why the midwife
had closed the shutters.</i>

1439
02:06:34,005 --> 02:06:36,533
<i>Nobody in the village
locked their house.</i>

1440
02:06:37,194 --> 02:06:40,296
<i>Why had the midwife
locked in her son?</i>

1441
02:06:40,854 --> 02:06:42,277
<i>Karli, can you hear me?</i>

1442
02:06:47,367 --> 02:06:50,064
<i>I thought of Erna's dream again.</i>

1443
02:06:50,497 --> 02:06:52,195
<i>What if Erna hadn't dreamt it,</i>

1444
02:06:52,305 --> 02:06:55,036
<i>but knew that Karli
would be tortured,</i>

1445
02:06:55,738 --> 02:06:57,965
<i>who had told her?</i>

1446
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:00,923
<i>Who wouldn't she denounce?</i>

1447
02:07:02,256 --> 02:07:05,989
<i>The kids' interest in Karli
seemed strange to me.</i>

1448
02:07:06,512 --> 02:07:10,074
<i>Usually, because of his disability,</i>

1449
02:07:10,265 --> 02:07:16,262
<i>they had no contact with him,
or treated him disdainfully.</i>

1450
02:07:17,752 --> 02:07:20,036
<i>When the midwife
couldn't take care of him,</i>

1451
02:07:20,457 --> 02:07:23,898
<i>she entrusted him to me
or the doctor.</i>

1452
02:07:24,347 --> 02:07:27,801
<i>But since his mishap,
I hadn't seen him again.</i>

1453
02:07:28,957 --> 02:07:32,087
<i>Worried,
I decided to ask the doctor.</i>

1454
02:07:32,557 --> 02:07:35,270
OFFICE CLOSED
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

1455
02:07:41,055 --> 02:07:43,542
- Wasn't his daughter in school?
- Yes, she was.

1456
02:07:44,701 --> 02:07:46,251
And she said nothing?

1457
02:07:48,207 --> 02:07:49,421
I have a request...

1458
02:07:50,622 --> 02:07:52,578
Could I talk to Klara and Martin?

1459
02:07:52,926 --> 02:07:54,559
Won't you wait for my husband?

1460
02:07:54,965 --> 02:07:57,775
He's at the church.
The service is almost over.

1461
02:07:58,725 --> 02:08:00,622
But if you insist, please come in.

1462
02:08:02,662 --> 02:08:03,980
Be seated.

1463
02:08:05,086 --> 02:08:06,403
I'll fetch them for you.

1464
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:44,371
Good evening, sir.

1465
02:08:46,136 --> 02:08:47,677
Won't you sit down?

1466
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:49,942
Yes. Perhaps. With pleasure.

1467
02:08:50,953 --> 02:08:52,690
Can I offer you something?

1468
02:08:55,266 --> 02:08:57,307
A coffee,
like during the piano lessons?

1469
02:08:59,487 --> 02:09:01,716
Yes, with pleasure.
Very kind of you.

1470
02:09:02,047 --> 02:09:03,349
I'll be right back.

1471
02:09:09,007 --> 02:09:11,438
Did you know the doctor
was leaving Eichwald?

1472
02:09:13,354 --> 02:09:15,511
You're not surprised by my question?

1473
02:09:15,807 --> 02:09:19,051
Our mother just told us.

1474
02:09:20,730 --> 02:09:22,912
Anna didn't tell you?

1475
02:09:26,435 --> 02:09:27,800
Not a word?

1476
02:09:29,356 --> 02:09:32,516
It's odd not to say
you're going away on a trip.

1477
02:09:32,688 --> 02:09:34,422
Anna doesn't say much.

1478
02:09:34,497 --> 02:09:36,231
But this was completely different.

1479
02:09:39,287 --> 02:09:41,265
You're hiding something from me.

1480
02:09:41,676 --> 02:09:42,716
What?

1481
02:09:43,414 --> 02:09:45,435
I'm waiting for you to tell me.

1482
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:51,797
When you looked for Karli,

1483
02:09:51,930 --> 02:09:53,689
what did you want from him?

1484
02:09:54,009 --> 02:09:55,908
We were worried. He's ill.

1485
02:09:56,024 --> 02:09:58,042
I'm asking Martin.

1486
02:09:59,025 --> 02:10:01,278
Yes. He isn't well.

1487
02:10:01,411 --> 02:10:03,655
And since his mother was leaving

1488
02:10:04,354 --> 02:10:06,786
we thought we'd pay him a visit.

1489
02:10:15,338 --> 02:10:18,856
Did you ever wonder
who mistreated Karli?

1490
02:10:20,731 --> 02:10:22,157
And Sigi?

1491
02:10:24,661 --> 02:10:26,930
Who tied the wire
to trip the doctor?

1492
02:10:27,252 --> 02:10:29,016
Who set fire to the barn?

1493
02:10:30,814 --> 02:10:31,877
No?

1494
02:10:32,068 --> 02:10:33,402
Of course, we wondered.

1495
02:10:33,729 --> 02:10:34,798
Well?

1496
02:10:35,493 --> 02:10:38,538
Father said
it must be a sick person.

1497
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:46,643
Sigi was with you at Thanksgiving.
And Karli always wenet along.

1498
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:48,657
I don't understand.

1499
02:10:48,707 --> 02:10:49,849
No?

1500
02:10:56,899 --> 02:10:58,095
What did they do wrong?

1501
02:10:59,393 --> 02:11:01,445
- Who?
- Sigi and Karli.

1502
02:11:01,671 --> 02:11:02,880
Why?

1503
02:11:02,984 --> 02:11:05,693
They obviously were being punished.
For what?

1504
02:11:05,923 --> 02:11:07,050
I don't know.

1505
02:11:07,413 --> 02:11:10,243
Erna foresaw that Karli
would be punished. What for?

1506
02:11:10,654 --> 02:11:11,805
I don't know!

1507
02:11:14,255 --> 02:11:15,440
Why ask us?

1508
02:11:15,528 --> 02:11:18,943
You're a smart girl, Klara.
Don't play dumb.

1509
02:11:22,015 --> 02:11:23,060
I don't understand.

1510
02:11:23,344 --> 02:11:26,703
Talk about this
with Father or Mother.

1511
02:11:27,061 --> 02:11:28,576
Shall I get them?

1512
02:11:28,786 --> 02:11:30,181
Martin, will you go?

1513
02:11:30,279 --> 02:11:32,001
Stay here, Martin.

1514
02:11:32,377 --> 02:11:35,015
I'll see them later.
Now, I'm talking to you.

1515
02:11:35,338 --> 02:11:37,703
Tell me the truth.

1516
02:11:38,048 --> 02:11:40,279
- Where were you when Karli was...
- Here.

1517
02:11:40,581 --> 02:11:42,938
I mean, after the confirmation?

1518
02:11:44,024 --> 02:11:45,537
Coffee's coming.

1519
02:11:50,199 --> 02:11:51,930
Could the children help you?

1520
02:11:54,239 --> 02:11:56,435
I'm afraid not. They know nothing.

1521
02:11:58,657 --> 02:12:00,930
His daughter said nothing at school?

1522
02:12:01,791 --> 02:12:02,811
No.

1523
02:12:04,125 --> 02:12:05,474
Sorry I disturbed you.

1524
02:12:05,569 --> 02:12:09,987
Stay! My husband is coming,
and the coffee is almost ready.

1525
02:12:10,212 --> 02:12:13,953
Thanks, but I'm worried
about the midwife's son.

1526
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:19,192
- She didn't say when she'd be back?
- I didn't ask her.

1527
02:12:20,104 --> 02:12:22,489
She caught me off guard.
She was panicked.

1528
02:12:22,913 --> 02:12:24,725
Wait, I hear my husband.

1529
02:12:24,838 --> 02:12:28,252
Good evening.

1530
02:12:29,673 --> 02:12:31,532
The teacher was waiting for you.

1531
02:12:32,453 --> 02:12:34,702
Yes. I'd like a word with you.

1532
02:12:35,073 --> 02:12:38,369
Please. Let's go to my study.
It's quieter.

1533
02:12:43,469 --> 02:12:45,393
What's this about?

1534
02:12:48,311 --> 02:12:50,387
I spoke to the midwife:

1535
02:12:50,667 --> 02:12:53,368
she said she knew
who tortured her son.

1536
02:12:54,793 --> 02:12:58,658
She'll only tell the police,
and went to town.

1537
02:13:01,476 --> 02:13:02,476
Well?

1538
02:13:04,029 --> 02:13:07,564
She left the boy behind alone
and locked the house.

1539
02:13:08,984 --> 02:13:10,332
Locked it?

1540
02:13:12,884 --> 02:13:15,037
I went to ask the doctor

1541
02:13:15,166 --> 02:13:17,417
if he was caring
for the child, but...

1542
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:22,454
there's a paper saying
that the office is closed.

1543
02:13:22,891 --> 02:13:25,329
He and his kids have disappeared.

1544
02:13:25,844 --> 02:13:26,932
What does it mean?

1545
02:13:27,167 --> 02:13:28,417
I don't know.

1546
02:13:29,253 --> 02:13:32,131
I thought you might know.
That's why I'm here.

1547
02:13:32,779 --> 02:13:33,824
I have no idea.

1548
02:13:35,547 --> 02:13:36,938
Please be seated.

1549
02:13:41,246 --> 02:13:43,724
Wasn't his daughter in school?

1550
02:13:44,060 --> 02:13:46,680
Yes. She mentioned nothing.

1551
02:13:50,007 --> 02:13:53,600
I asked Klara and Martin.
They know nothing either.

1552
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:55,694
Why should they?

1553
02:13:58,250 --> 02:13:59,497
I don't know...

1554
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:04,646
I went to Mrs Wagner's place:
they and some others were there.

1555
02:14:05,161 --> 02:14:06,538
To do what?

1556
02:14:07,009 --> 02:14:08,409
They were looking for the boy.

1557
02:14:08,804 --> 02:14:09,841
Why?

1558
02:14:10,547 --> 02:14:12,211
They wanted to help him.

1559
02:14:13,726 --> 02:14:14,780
So what?

1560
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:19,426
I don't know how to say it...

1561
02:14:20,128 --> 02:14:22,323
I think they're hiding something.

1562
02:14:22,529 --> 02:14:23,658
What?

1563
02:14:25,970 --> 02:14:27,224
I don't know.

1564
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:31,180
When the doctor had his accident,

1565
02:14:31,555 --> 02:14:33,186
last year,

1566
02:14:34,391 --> 02:14:38,430
they appeared in his garden.
Supposedly, to help Anna.

1567
02:14:40,559 --> 02:14:41,671
Yes... and?

1568
02:14:43,662 --> 02:14:45,712
Nothing. I had forgotten it.

1569
02:14:46,618 --> 02:14:48,533
I just remembered today.

1570
02:14:49,936 --> 02:14:51,118
I don't understand.

1571
02:14:53,009 --> 02:14:55,493
When the Baron's son was found...

1572
02:14:55,805 --> 02:14:57,943
He'd been with the children
just before.

1573
02:15:01,475 --> 02:15:02,798
What are you getting at?

1574
02:15:04,426 --> 02:15:06,065
The steward's daughter

1575
02:15:06,462 --> 02:15:11,088
predicted that Karli
would be beaten.

1576
02:15:11,652 --> 02:15:13,578
She says she dreamt it.

1577
02:15:14,173 --> 02:15:16,025
The police think she's lying.

1578
02:15:16,949 --> 02:15:20,188
From whom did she find out?
Who told her?

1579
02:15:37,359 --> 02:15:40,512
You're saying that your pupils,
my children included,

1580
02:15:40,684 --> 02:15:43,594
committed these crimes.
Is that right?

1581
02:15:47,690 --> 02:15:49,262
You realize what you're saying?

1582
02:15:50,356 --> 02:15:52,041
Do you really know...

1583
02:16:06,947 --> 02:16:08,841
I assume I'm the first person

1584
02:16:09,988 --> 02:16:12,573
to hear these monstrosities.

1585
02:16:15,118 --> 02:16:17,417
If you ever dare

1586
02:16:18,287 --> 02:16:20,110
to bother others with this,

1587
02:16:21,194 --> 02:16:22,855
if you ever accuse

1588
02:16:23,257 --> 02:16:25,865
respectable families and their children

1589
02:16:26,265 --> 02:16:27,971
and denounce them publicly,

1590
02:16:29,208 --> 02:16:32,309
I'll make sure, take my word for it,

1591
02:16:32,694 --> 02:16:34,240
that you go to prison.

1592
02:16:35,496 --> 02:16:39,416
I've seen a lot
during my work as a pastor,

1593
02:16:39,619 --> 02:16:43,171
but never anything so repulsive!

1594
02:16:45,346 --> 02:16:47,700
One can tell you have no children.

1595
02:16:49,350 --> 02:16:52,468
Or you wouldn't stoop
to such aberrations.

1596
02:16:55,073 --> 02:16:56,692
You have a sick mind.

1597
02:16:57,950 --> 02:17:01,993
How did they let you loose
among those poor creatures!

1598
02:17:04,004 --> 02:17:07,361
I'll speak to the authorities
about this.

1599
02:17:08,352 --> 02:17:10,316
Now get out of my house!

1600
02:17:11,841 --> 02:17:13,634
I don't want to see you here again.

1601
02:17:20,871 --> 02:17:23,050
<i>The midwife didn't come back.</i>

1602
02:17:24,227 --> 02:17:27,272
<i>I waited until morning,
two days later.</i>

1603
02:17:27,745 --> 02:17:29,149
<i>Then I went to the manor house</i>

1604
02:17:29,246 --> 02:17:31,358
<i>to inform the Baron.</i>

1605
02:17:31,733 --> 02:17:34,751
<i>He told the steward
and said to open the house</i>

1606
02:17:34,916 --> 02:17:36,832
<i>and take care of the disabled boy.</i>

1607
02:17:37,226 --> 02:17:38,376
<i>I'll look upstairs.</i>

1608
02:17:40,147 --> 02:17:42,782
<i>I'd never been
in the midwife's house</i>

1609
02:17:43,179 --> 02:17:44,407
<i>and felt uncomfortable</i>

1610
02:17:44,495 --> 02:17:48,359
<i>barging into somebody else's place
without asking.</i>

1611
02:17:50,218 --> 02:17:51,643
<i>It was strange,</i>

1612
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:56,352
<i>but while we still searched
and called out Karli's name,</i>

1613
02:17:56,555 --> 02:17:59,675
<i>I already knew
our search was in vain.</i>

1614
02:18:00,502 --> 02:18:04,912
<i>Anyone who knew how devoted
the midwife was to her son,</i>

1615
02:18:05,353 --> 02:18:10,770
<i>knew she'd never have abandoned
her wounded Karli.</i>

1616
02:18:13,635 --> 02:18:15,367
<i>During the next few weeks,</i>

1617
02:18:15,477 --> 02:18:18,596
<i>the village gossips worked overtime.</i>

1618
02:18:19,379 --> 02:18:22,649
<i>Some claimed the doctor
was Karli's father.</i>

1619
02:18:23,129 --> 02:18:25,747
<i>He and the midwife
had tried to abort the child</i>

1620
02:18:25,895 --> 02:18:29,380
<i>so their relationship
wouldn't be found out,</i>

1621
02:18:29,773 --> 02:18:33,260
<i>and that's how
the child was disabled.</i>

1622
02:18:34,261 --> 02:18:36,101
<i>Some even claimed</i>

1623
02:18:36,216 --> 02:18:40,513
<i>that the death of the doctor's wife
was suspect,</i>

1624
02:18:40,734 --> 02:18:44,868
<i>and the two might very well
be responsible for it.</i>

1625
02:18:46,245 --> 02:18:48,201
<i>Better still,
the doctor and the midwife,</i>

1626
02:18:48,287 --> 02:18:50,243
<i>as potential murderers,y</i>

1627
02:18:50,362 --> 02:18:54,708
<i>had also perpetrated
all the other crimes.</i>

1628
02:18:55,243 --> 02:18:58,081
<i>Wanting to spare
his legitimate children and himself</i>

1629
02:18:58,239 --> 02:19:01,217
<i>from public disclosure of his guilt,</i>

1630
02:19:01,379 --> 02:19:04,504
<i>the doctor had fled with them.</i>

1631
02:19:06,066 --> 02:19:10,379
<i>On July 28th,
Austria declared war on Serbia.</i>

1632
02:19:10,798 --> 02:19:14,888
<i>On Saturday, August 1st,
Germany declared war on Russia,</i>

1633
02:19:15,102 --> 02:19:18,025
<i>and on France the following Monday.</i>

1634
02:19:19,823 --> 02:19:24,144
<i>The solemn service next Sunday
was attended by the whole village.</i>

1635
02:19:24,507 --> 02:19:28,145
<i>A feeling of expectation
and departure was in the air.</i>

1636
02:19:28,618 --> 02:19:31,047
<i>Now everything was going to change.</i>

1637
02:19:31,781 --> 02:19:35,211
<i>Eva's father,
in the face of the coming war,</i>

1638
02:19:35,590 --> 02:19:37,692
<i>had taken his daughter back home,</i>

1639
02:19:37,782 --> 02:19:41,291
<i>and, at her pleading,
had come to Eichwald</i>

1640
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:46,481
<i>where his future son-in-law lived
and worked, to look it over.</i>

1641
02:19:47,638 --> 02:19:51,674
<i>The prospect of soon calling
this beloved creature my wife</i>

1642
02:19:51,881 --> 02:19:55,030
<i>also made this a festive day for me.</i>

1643
02:19:56,055 --> 02:19:58,976
<i>The pastor never mentioned
our conversation again.</i>

1644
02:19:59,353 --> 02:20:03,948
<i>And apparently never went through
with his threat to denounce me.</i>

1645
02:20:05,177 --> 02:20:08,346
<i>I was drafted at the start of 1917.</i>

1646
02:20:08,763 --> 02:20:12,027
<i>After the war,
as my father had died meanwhile,</i>

1647
02:20:12,477 --> 02:20:14,558
<i>I sold his house in Vasendorf,</i>

1648
02:20:15,021 --> 02:20:19,033
<i>and with the money
opened a tailor's shop in town.</i>

1649
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:22,166
<i>I never saw
any of the villagers again.</i>
