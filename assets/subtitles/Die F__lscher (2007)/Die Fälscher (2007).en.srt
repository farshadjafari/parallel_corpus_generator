1
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,940
THE COUNTERFEITERS

2
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:12,889
THE WAR IS OVER

3
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,152
BEAUTIFUL SHORE

4
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,042
Monsieur Sorowitsch?

5
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:25,378
I'm afraid we require a deposit.

6
00:02:36,097 --> 00:02:38,683
$200 is more than enough.

7
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:49,944
Is this your first visit
to Monte CarIo?

8
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,882
ExceIIent.
That's going to be fine.

9
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:13,134
Little adjustment here, that's all.

10
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:40,078
PRIVATE ROOM

11
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,715
Cheers.

12
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,584
What's that?

13
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:34,757
You're not from a camp,
are you?

14
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:00,992
I'm not a...

15
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,698
Sally!

16
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:48,706
Schmitz!

17
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,627
Where's the other 150?

18
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,880
Know how risky it is
off-loading your duds?

19
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,131
Sally!

20
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,970
Can you lend me something?
Twenty?

21
00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:06,474
Come over all political?

22
00:06:06,557 --> 00:06:08,643
Ludwig here took me along
to a meeting.

23
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:10,478
Heil! Heil! Heil!

24
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:13,481
And I've joined them too!

25
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:15,316
Look!

26
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,985
He gave it to me
'cause I'm so kind to him!

27
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:19,821
In bed or in the party?

28
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:23,074
You see, Schmitz...

29
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:26,786
if I let you cheat me, tomorrow
someone eIse wiII cheat me.

30
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,371
Soon they'll all cheat me.

31
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:31,999
It's not about the 150.
It's a matter of principle.

32
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,753
It's about my very existence,
and for that I could be driven...

33
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:38,673
to take extreme measures.

34
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:41,509
Sally, you old crook!

35
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:43,928
Let me introduce
an old friend of mine!

36
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:48,015
Sally Sorowitsch, the most
charming scoundrel in Berlin!

37
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,226
Sorowitsch?

38
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,686
Are you Russian?

39
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:54,355
I hope you're not a Communist?

40
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,191
Enough of a Communist
to share my champagne with you.

41
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:01,696
Sally--that's a droll sort of name.

42
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,406
Where does it come from?

43
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:07,952
It's short for Salomon.

44
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:11,289
Salomon?

45
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:19,881
She can spit the champagne back.
It's a RothschiId.

46
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:28,639
I'm trusting you.

47
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:35,980
What do they aIways say?
Don't do business with Jews!

48
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:41,736
Trying so hard not to be noticed
gets you noticed.

49
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,738
Not learnt that yet
in the Resistance?

50
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:45,072
I'm sorry, Sally.

51
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:48,242
- In two hours up at my place.
- OK, SaIIy.

52
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:01,756
You're leaving?

53
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,965
Tonight.

54
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,510
Got a tip-off.
Been here too long.

55
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:16,604
Crack the dollar
and you can do anything.

56
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:19,774
It's not quite perfect.
But one of these days...

57
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:22,026
Have you got the money?

58
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,863
That's what we wanted
to taIk to you about.

59
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:29,951
- They're our people.
- Our peopIe?

60
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:32,620
I'm me and the others
are the others.

61
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:37,625
Don't you see
what's going on around you?

62
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,627
What the Nazis are doing to us?

63
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,380
Know why the Jews
are always persecuted?

64
00:08:42,463 --> 00:08:45,132
Because they refuse to adapt!
It's not that hard.

65
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:48,636
- Sally, don't you have any--
- No.

66
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:50,304
Need a certificate of Aryan purity?

67
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:53,474
I'll do one proving you descend
from Siegfried and the Dragon.

68
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:54,809
Do you know Schiele?

69
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,979
I even met him once,

70
00:08:58,062 --> 00:08:59,230
in Vienna.

71
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:00,523
A great master.

72
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:03,150
Your pictures.

73
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:06,237
I don't believe
you're such an asshole.

74
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:15,663
Who'd have thought it?
Hans using beautiful women...

75
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:17,832
Listen--

76
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:20,251
The jeweIry's
not even worth half.

77
00:09:21,752 --> 00:09:23,838
I need an Argentinean passport.

78
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:29,010
- I've already packed.
- Hans, you can go.

79
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:32,638
I'll settle this with Mr. Sorowitsch.

80
00:09:46,777 --> 00:09:48,195
You're lucky...

81
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,699
wanting an Argentinean passport.

82
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:55,494
The home of tango.

83
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:46,170
You could be a really great artist.

84
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:49,173
What do you know about it?

85
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:51,509
A great deal.

86
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,428
Otherwise I wouldn't have stayed.

87
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:58,766
Why earn money by making art?

88
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,770
Earning money by making money
is far easier.

89
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,992
I have to go.

90
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,421
May I?

91
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:32,717
Friedrich Herzog, Berlin CID,
Counterfeit Squad.

92
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,803
It is a great honor

93
00:11:35,886 --> 00:11:38,514
to arrest the world's
best counterfeiter,

94
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:41,225
if that is any consolation.

95
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:45,896
The dollar!

96
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:50,067
Bitten off more
than we can chew, eh?

97
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,101
Go on!

98
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:32,860
Get up, you lazy Jewish bastard!

99
00:12:32,943 --> 00:12:35,529
Get up, will you!

100
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:40,618
You there!
Get rid of that vermin!

101
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:46,624
They're out to get us.

102
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:53,464
This is no jail.

103
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:55,883
They're going to kill us.

104
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:59,136
They're out to get us.

105
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:02,598
The Kapo:

106
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,058
Melzer.

107
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,685
Watch out for him.

108
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,855
A murderer.

109
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:14,568
The ones with the green triangle...

110
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:17,613
habitual criminals,
worse than the SS.

111
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:26,997
But you don't look like a--

112
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:35,589
If you touch me I'll cut your throat.

113
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,723
I'll be watching you,
you fiIthy swine.

114
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:46,892
I'll get you!

115
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:51,272
Are you crazy?
You can't just--

116
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:52,773
He has to respect me,

117
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:55,109
but not lose face.

118
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:58,112
The same as in any other jail.

119
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:08,599
On your feet!

120
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,151
Who did this?

121
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,793
Number 75517.

122
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,055
I like it.

123
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:52,393
You've caught it well, Jew.

124
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:54,853
- It would be better in color.
- What?

125
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:59,066
It would be better in color,
Herr UnterscharfÃ¼hrer.

126
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:01,485
The sheen of the boots.

127
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:05,030
Drawn from memory.

128
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:28,178
What's all this?

129
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:34,059
Herr HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer, it's...

130
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,062
It's like this, I...

131
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:58,751
FIVE YEARS LATER

132
00:17:02,046 --> 00:17:03,213
Sorowitsch!

133
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:05,674
Look at this.

134
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,635
I thought a Styrian jacket
would look good!

135
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:12,014
I can paint whatever you want,
Herr SturmbannfÃ¼hrer.

136
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,017
You're being moved.
Sachsenhausen. Tomorrow.

137
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:19,313
But the picture isn't finished.

138
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:21,440
I have to finish the picture.

139
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:24,151
So the maggot's afraid
of Iosing its bacon!

140
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:27,321
A dirty IittIe Jew Iike you
can fix himself up anywhere!

141
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:02,106
Stinks to high heaven, that Jew!

142
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,829
Food.

143
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:47,568
I always admired
the Russian avant-garde.

144
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:49,069
Kandinsky, Rodchenko!

145
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:52,156
At the academy in Odessa
we had a professor called Lebed.

146
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,743
In my time,
Lebed was a junior lecturer.

147
00:18:56,827 --> 00:18:59,997
You were at the academy?
You're Russian too?

148
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,002
I don't like speaking Russian.
Reminds me of bad times.

149
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:08,964
You prefer to speak German?

150
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:15,888
I had a family.

151
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:20,601
We used to say,

152
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:25,272
Lebed and good art
is like a virgin and good...

153
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:26,940
Fucking.

154
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:28,567
So you know that one too!

155
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,806
Number 75517.

156
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,642
Salomon Sorowitsch.

157
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:05,979
The King of Counterfeiters!

158
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:11,151
SS SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Herzog.
Don't you remember? Herzog?

159
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:13,320
CID Berlin, Counterfeit Squad.

160
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:17,324
I arrested you!
It got me promoted!

161
00:20:21,078 --> 00:20:22,496
What size are you?

162
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,748
48.

163
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:27,709
- Shoe size?
- 42.

164
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:34,299
Welcome to Sachsenhausen!

165
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:42,307
Name, profession, size?

166
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:44,851
Burger, printer.

167
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:46,353
Collotype. 52.

168
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:48,855
More like 46/48 now.

169
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:51,483
Shoe size?

170
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:52,568
41.

171
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,777
No, thanks.

172
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:57,197
A non-smoker! As you wish.
Much heaIthier!

173
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:00,867
Name, profession, size?

174
00:21:05,455 --> 00:21:07,040
Welcome to Sachsenhausen.

175
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:38,488
We use a different tone
here in my domain

176
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:41,408
than in the camps
you've just come from.

177
00:21:41,491 --> 00:21:44,536
I'd like to regard you
as coworkers here.

178
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,538
Together we're going to...

179
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,001
Yes.

180
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:54,796
The clothes are secondhand.

181
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,967
You can wear prison stripes
if you prefer.

182
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,094
After all,
stripes flatter the figure!

183
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:03,221
What's his name?

184
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:15,067
What the hell was that for?

185
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:18,862
A symbolic gesture--
to get us shot?

186
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:02,739
My dear Jews...

187
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:07,661
today I bring you a specialist
of international standing,

188
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:09,830
Salomon Sorowitsch.

189
00:23:09,913 --> 00:23:12,416
He will supervise
the retouching department!

190
00:23:16,086 --> 00:23:17,504
"Operation Bernhard."

191
00:23:18,588 --> 00:23:20,590
Counterfeit money
on a huge scale.

192
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,177
ID cards, documents, banknotes...

193
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,931
all to the latest technical standards.

194
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,186
I expect the newcomers will want
to freshen up and reIax?

195
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,856
Our foreman here, dear old Atze,

196
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:37,441
will show you around.

197
00:23:38,442 --> 00:23:40,527
I wish you every success!

198
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:50,287
Another fine speech by
Herr SturmbannfÃ¼hrer.

199
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:13,477
Fine beds.

200
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,232
Why are they giving us
such fine beds?

201
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,904
It's still a concentration camp.

202
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:29,451
But the beds are soft.

203
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:32,496
That's good.

204
00:24:55,185 --> 00:24:58,271
"Anny Ondra will only wash
with SarinoI."

205
00:25:07,864 --> 00:25:09,449
I was a commercial photographer.

206
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:27,884
Quiet in here, isn't it?

207
00:25:29,052 --> 00:25:30,720
One forgets what it's like.

208
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,392
Where are they all running to?

209
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:38,061
The shoe-testing squad.

210
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:41,064
They make the prisoners
run in a circle...

211
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:43,984
to test the shoes.

212
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:45,485
Test them? How?

213
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:49,656
It's a punishment. The shoes are
too small, sandbags on their backs.

214
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:50,907
Many of them die.

215
00:25:52,242 --> 00:25:53,827
Best not to even listen.

216
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,664
Music!

217
00:25:58,748 --> 00:26:02,002
Right Iads, I'II show you
where you'll be working!

218
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:08,842
We've got men here from all
different camps. All professional--

219
00:26:08,925 --> 00:26:13,346
graphic artists, printers,
retouchers, copper engravers.

220
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,515
Why are they using Jews
for the work?

221
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,351
I assume
they mean to kill us after the war.

222
00:26:18,435 --> 00:26:19,686
To keep it under wraps.

223
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:23,023
A genuine platen press.
Worked with one before?

224
00:26:25,442 --> 00:26:28,528
Lazy bastards!
Faster, you idle riffraff!

225
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:31,031
It's OK. He's Dr. Klinger,
our Kapo.

226
00:26:31,114 --> 00:26:33,450
The SS need to hear him
yeIIing at us.

227
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:44,377
The new arrivals?

228
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:46,880
Dr. Klinger, internal medicine.

229
00:26:48,465 --> 00:26:50,383
Welcome to the Golden Cage.

230
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:53,386
Come and see me
at once, young man.

231
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,221
That foot looks bad...

232
00:26:55,305 --> 00:26:56,890
really bad!

233
00:27:03,313 --> 00:27:06,566
I wept too, the first time
I saw a printing press again.

234
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,901
Reminds you
you're a human being.

235
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:11,905
Zilinski, darkroom.

236
00:27:11,988 --> 00:27:14,240
Matti, show him the ropes.

237
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:16,993
Karloff?

238
00:27:18,078 --> 00:27:22,082
Graphics section. Through there,
straight ahead. You can't miss it.

239
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:23,583
Us two beauties...

240
00:27:24,584 --> 00:27:26,169
are going to Quality Control.

241
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:37,597
Dr. Viktor Hahn, Royal Prussian
Credit Bank, Hamburg.

242
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,018
Mr. Sorowitsch will supervise
the retouching section.

243
00:27:42,102 --> 00:27:45,021
You're aIso
from the financial sector?

244
00:27:47,524 --> 00:27:50,026
Our main problem is the paper.

245
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,028
It has the wrong feel.

246
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:57,117
The EngIish paper has the same
structure as a kind of Turkish linen.

247
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,203
We've experimented
with various chemicals,

248
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:02,455
but the results
remain unsatisfactory.

249
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:06,126
A green triangle?

250
00:28:06,209 --> 00:28:08,795
A habitual criminal, Herr Laube?

251
00:28:08,878 --> 00:28:11,172
Sorowitsch is--if one can say so--

252
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,550
a "professional" counterfeiter.

253
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,468
Till now the only criminals here

254
00:28:15,552 --> 00:28:18,680
were those wearing
Nazi uniforms, my good man.

255
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:24,936
So it besmirches your honor
having to work with a jailbird?

256
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:27,981
If honor is all one has left!

257
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:30,984
You'll have a hard time here.
And that's a promise.

258
00:28:34,738 --> 00:28:35,905
Fuck you.

259
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:48,334
A weekend off!

260
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:52,672
And a shower on Sunday!

261
00:28:52,756 --> 00:28:55,175
Fraternizing
with a common criminal?

262
00:28:55,258 --> 00:28:58,344
The true criminals
are the capitalist exploiters.

263
00:28:58,428 --> 00:29:01,014
They're the ones
who made Fascism possible.

264
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:04,517
If a proletarian steals bread
to feed his children...

265
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:06,978
That's not exactly what I did.

266
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:09,522
You gave a comrade
your slice of bread.

267
00:29:10,607 --> 00:29:11,858
That was solidarity.

268
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:14,152
That was soup.

269
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:16,529
A low number.

270
00:29:16,613 --> 00:29:18,865
How did you survive
so long in Auschwitz?

271
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,618
A good work detail.

272
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,538
What about a game?

273
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:29,709
- What are we playing for?
- For honor's sake.

274
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:33,630
I win even when I don't cheat.

275
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:51,106
What are you doing,
you idIe bastard?

276
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,941
This isn't a rest home!

277
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,401
You're here to work!
Understood?

278
00:29:55,485 --> 00:29:56,653
Holst!

279
00:29:58,321 --> 00:29:59,656
Leave him be!

280
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,994
Thinking can also be work, Holst!
Try it yourseIf sometime.

281
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:11,751
All amateurs and idiots.

282
00:30:11,835 --> 00:30:14,754
Forget the circumstances
for a moment.

283
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,758
It's just you and me.
The most perfect forgeries ever.

284
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:20,844
First the pound...

285
00:30:21,845 --> 00:30:24,013
and then the dollar!

286
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:28,101
Men, machines, material--
whatever you need!

287
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:31,604
You see, Sorowitsch...

288
00:30:32,856 --> 00:30:35,608
there are ways of surviving here.

289
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:38,194
I can't guarantee it
for the others, but for you...

290
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,698
if...

291
00:31:03,052 --> 00:31:06,139
Gentlemen, can't you stop that
nigger music?

292
00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:08,474
As if there
weren't any German music!

293
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:10,810
One more before bedtime.

294
00:31:10,894 --> 00:31:13,479
Why isn't God in Auschwitz?

295
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:15,732
He didn't get through
the selection process!

296
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:21,905
Kanada.

297
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:26,409
The low number.

298
00:31:27,577 --> 00:31:30,079
I was in the Kanada work detail.

299
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,333
We sorted the luggage
on the pIatform.

300
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:35,585
We took the food in the bags

301
00:31:35,668 --> 00:31:38,671
while the people it belonged to
were being gassed.

302
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:43,218
One adapts or dies.

303
00:31:47,263 --> 00:31:48,514
I can't go on like this.

304
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:53,353
We have it so good in here...

305
00:31:55,271 --> 00:31:56,648
while out there...

306
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:00,860
My wife is still in Auschwitz.

307
00:32:03,446 --> 00:32:07,283
I won't give the Nazis the pleasure
of being ashamed I'm still alive.

308
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:18,711
All prisoners to remain
in their barracks!

309
00:32:22,465 --> 00:32:25,843
Allegedly not even the commandant
knows what we do in here!

310
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:27,136
...will be shot immediately!

311
00:32:39,565 --> 00:32:42,652
...anything, as Iong as
we aren't put out here again.

312
00:32:43,653 --> 00:32:44,654
Anything...

313
00:33:06,175 --> 00:33:07,677
What's the matter?

314
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:10,096
They're going to gas us!

315
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:12,765
We're too valuable,
they won't harm us.

316
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:14,642
Come on, get undressed.

317
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:15,893
Come on!

318
00:33:19,355 --> 00:33:20,523
Burger!

319
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:23,693
Can you hear me?
Are you hurt?

320
00:33:24,694 --> 00:33:26,195
Get up.

321
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:28,364
- Leave him, Burger! Come here!
- Dr. KIinger!

322
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,078
You there!

323
00:33:35,705 --> 00:33:37,123
What are you doing here?

324
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,877
Did any of them speak to you?

325
00:33:41,377 --> 00:33:43,129
Did anybody speak to you?

326
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:44,630
Number 64000.

327
00:33:44,714 --> 00:33:47,300
- I asked if anybody here spoke to you.
- He was Iying on the...

328
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:49,469
Shut your face.
Did he speak to you?

329
00:33:49,552 --> 00:33:51,971
- I don't know him.
- What did he say?

330
00:33:52,055 --> 00:33:54,474
God, are you dumb!
You come with me.

331
00:33:58,227 --> 00:33:59,979
What did you say to him?

332
00:34:00,063 --> 00:34:03,983
It's forbidden to speak
to other prisoners.

333
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:13,326
Mr. Burger
is our only collotype expert.

334
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:15,328
He didn't speak to him either.

335
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:19,582
Go and shower.

336
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,088
Go and shower!

337
00:34:32,428 --> 00:34:33,679
I just wanted to help him.

338
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:47,902
Move!

339
00:34:50,446 --> 00:34:54,367
They're going to gas us.
Gas... I can smeII it.

340
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:57,787
Water! It's water!

341
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:35,241
Odessa?

342
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:37,785
For you!

343
00:35:38,828 --> 00:35:41,456
PIease excuse,
about today in shower.

344
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,749
Reminds me a bit of Lukanov.

345
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:46,752
Yes.

346
00:35:46,836 --> 00:35:48,671
Do you know his city views?

347
00:35:49,672 --> 00:35:52,425
Colors!
A pity there are no colors here.

348
00:35:52,508 --> 00:35:55,094
For me Odessa is blue, dark blue!

349
00:35:58,514 --> 00:36:00,766
In the academy they said
my styIe is bad.

350
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,853
But it's my art.
Even if it only pleases me.

351
00:36:28,794 --> 00:36:29,962
Let me have a look.

352
00:36:32,715 --> 00:36:33,883
I can do better than that.

353
00:36:35,218 --> 00:36:36,385
Let me try again.

354
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:42,433
Number 93--

355
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:46,312
Have you settled in yet?

356
00:36:46,395 --> 00:36:47,813
Got everything you need?

357
00:36:47,897 --> 00:36:51,150
The ID cards we're supposed
to produce--

358
00:36:51,234 --> 00:36:53,319
the problem's
the cover and the paper.

359
00:36:53,402 --> 00:36:56,614
If we could have used originals...

360
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:59,909
You must now devote
all your efforts to the pound!

361
00:37:00,993 --> 00:37:03,496
It's important
we get results soon.

362
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:05,414
Himmler is growing impatient.

363
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:09,877
What's this?

364
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:12,588
My 5-year-old could do better!

365
00:37:16,926 --> 00:37:19,178
I'm a rail track layer.

366
00:37:19,262 --> 00:37:22,348
I said I was a printer
to get out of Sobibor.

367
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:25,184
They couldn't translate
my ID card. HeIp me!

368
00:37:28,104 --> 00:37:31,691
Paracystosis,
a material defect in the copper.

369
00:37:31,774 --> 00:37:34,360
Loszek is a specialist
in reIief printing.

370
00:37:34,443 --> 00:37:37,530
He could be transferred
to the ID card section.

371
00:37:38,614 --> 00:37:40,283
Paracystosis.

372
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:47,206
Or we could have him shot.

373
00:37:51,043 --> 00:37:51,752
Beat it!

374
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:02,638
Never try to deceive me again,
Sorowitsch.

375
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,141
We're on the same side now.

376
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:05,201
Is this some
of the Turkish linen?

377
00:39:06,202 --> 00:39:08,579
Yes. I thought--

378
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,998
Throw that away.

379
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,460
Rags!

380
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:16,629
The English use rags!

381
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:19,215
Fibers, torn and abraded
thousands of times!

382
00:39:55,918 --> 00:39:59,171
Hardly any of the English
use waIIets.

383
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:02,842
They pin the notes together
with safety pins.

384
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:06,846
That's why we're making
the little holes here at the edges.

385
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:12,309
Negative retouching.

386
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:49,388
It's not just a matter of sIipping
a few notes past a shop assistant.

387
00:40:51,307 --> 00:40:54,393
We intend to flood and destroy
Britain's economy.

388
00:40:56,979 --> 00:40:59,899
If they realize we're using
forged notes...

389
00:41:01,484 --> 00:41:03,235
that'll be the end of the operation.

390
00:41:04,153 --> 00:41:05,821
We'd have to send you back...

391
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:08,866
to the camps.

392
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:28,093
She wasn't wearing any knickers!

393
00:41:28,177 --> 00:41:32,056
Just imagine, a photo shoot with
an agent, producer, and everything,

394
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:35,768
and that hot IittIe tart
with no knickers! Skirt like this.

395
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:38,437
"Doesn't the gentleman
want to take another shot?"

396
00:41:39,522 --> 00:41:42,441
"Sure. I won't even need a tripod."

397
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,778
You're standing in the sun.

398
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:55,287
If we fail to bring off the pound...

399
00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:58,123
we should organize ourselves!

400
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:01,293
There's a lot of us.

401
00:42:01,877 --> 00:42:04,880
We're well nourished,
we're strong, we could fight!

402
00:42:05,881 --> 00:42:07,132
We've got tools.

403
00:42:07,216 --> 00:42:08,801
With retouching knives?

404
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:11,804
Against an SS company?

405
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:14,723
Rather than let them gas us!

406
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,272
I'd rather be gassed tomorrow
than shot for nothing today.

407
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:22,690
A day is a day.

408
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:27,528
A revolt would at least be a sign!

409
00:42:31,907 --> 00:42:33,075
Zilinski's right.

410
00:42:34,743 --> 00:42:35,995
You're standing in the sun.

411
00:42:46,088 --> 00:42:47,840
Kolya?

412
00:42:47,923 --> 00:42:49,508
When did the fever start?

413
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,345
Sometimes fever is bad.

414
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:55,014
In between, it's OK.

415
00:42:56,891 --> 00:43:00,853
We've had TB cases here before.
I asked for drugs, and...

416
00:43:00,936 --> 00:43:02,688
Kleinfeld, Stiasny, Jilovsky.

417
00:43:02,771 --> 00:43:05,482
All shot, because of
the risk of infection.

418
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:06,984
Can you help him?

419
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:08,611
I'll see what I...

420
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:11,113
Without the right drugs...

421
00:43:13,115 --> 00:43:14,283
Isolate him.

422
00:43:17,786 --> 00:43:19,371
I'm a doctor--

423
00:43:19,455 --> 00:43:20,623
internal medicine!

424
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,503
Bad sickness?

425
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:28,047
No, no.

426
00:43:29,131 --> 00:43:30,716
The doctor will make it better.

427
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,888
I have to live to see
when the camp is over.

428
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:39,975
Exactly!

429
00:43:59,828 --> 00:44:01,080
Bring some dressings, fast!

430
00:44:07,336 --> 00:44:10,255
Those original documents
you asked for.

431
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:12,257
The crates came from Auschwitz.

432
00:44:12,341 --> 00:44:14,760
Loszek found
his children's passports.

433
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:22,017
This is pointless!

434
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:25,896
You have to survive.

435
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:30,275
OnIy by surviving
can we defeat them!

436
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,278
You have to survive!

437
00:44:33,362 --> 00:44:34,863
Loszek, you must survive!

438
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:45,582
Wake up!

439
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:47,126
Assemble for roll call outside!

440
00:44:47,209 --> 00:44:48,877
Filthy Jewish scum!

441
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:52,923
Outside!

442
00:44:59,805 --> 00:45:01,432
Get out!

443
00:45:16,405 --> 00:45:20,159
Sorry to wake you,
but I have a story to tell.

444
00:45:21,243 --> 00:45:24,455
A few days ago, a businessman
went into a bank in Zurich.

445
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,458
He was carrying a small case...

446
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:29,209
full of money.

447
00:45:31,253 --> 00:45:32,671
Pound notes.

448
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:43,015
Our agent asks to open an account
with his British pounds.

449
00:45:43,098 --> 00:45:44,391
Of course, Monsieur.

450
00:45:45,392 --> 00:45:48,312
But you must understand,
for reasons of security,

451
00:45:48,395 --> 00:45:51,356
we have to check
the authenticity of these notes.

452
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,649
But of course!

453
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,360
In times like these...

454
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:00,866
For half an hour,

455
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:04,161
Swiss bank experts scrutiniZed
our little printed products,

456
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:06,038
with a vengeance.

457
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,840
Your bank notes.

458
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:19,885
Our examination has confirmed

459
00:46:19,968 --> 00:46:22,679
that as far as we can tell...

460
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:25,891
they are...

461
00:46:26,475 --> 00:46:28,811
genuine!

462
00:46:33,065 --> 00:46:34,566
Wait, it's not over yet.

463
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,735
Our agent gets cocky!

464
00:46:36,819 --> 00:46:38,153
Monsieur le Directeur...

465
00:46:39,154 --> 00:46:40,906
since I received these notes

466
00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:45,077
from an admittedly
rather dubious source...

467
00:46:46,161 --> 00:46:48,914
I'd prefer to have
absolute certainty.

468
00:46:48,997 --> 00:46:51,625
Our bank
will accept your money.

469
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,586
- There is no need--
- Absolute certainty, Monsieur.

470
00:46:55,671 --> 00:46:57,589
If you insist,

471
00:46:57,673 --> 00:47:01,593
then I suggest we have the notes
checked by the Bank of England.

472
00:47:01,677 --> 00:47:03,762
The Bank of England!

473
00:47:03,846 --> 00:47:06,265
Let's see what they have
to carp about.

474
00:47:06,348 --> 00:47:08,016
Maybe we'll get a few tips.

475
00:47:12,521 --> 00:47:14,773
"After thorough examination,
we conclude

476
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:17,943
"that the bank notes
submitted by you

477
00:47:18,026 --> 00:47:19,695
"in denominations of Â£5,

478
00:47:19,778 --> 00:47:22,906
"Â£10, and Â£20 sterling...

479
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:26,743
"are not forgeries.

480
00:47:27,828 --> 00:47:31,623
The Bank of England herewith
guarantees their authenticity."

481
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,466
ReichsfÃ¼hrer SS Himmler
is very pleased with our efforts.

482
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:45,470
These duds are so perfect
our plans have changed.

483
00:47:45,554 --> 00:47:47,806
They're too good to be
simply dropped over England.

484
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:53,145
The German Reich wiII use them
for its long-term currency dealings!

485
00:47:53,979 --> 00:47:57,399
And in turn
this gave me the idea...

486
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,485
of giving you a little pleasure.

487
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:03,864
As an incentive, so to speak.

488
00:48:16,418 --> 00:48:17,669
I thought perhaps...

489
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:21,006
after work, or...

490
00:48:22,257 --> 00:48:23,717
at the weekend?

491
00:48:26,762 --> 00:48:31,183
On behalf of all the men, I'd like
to thank you for all our privileges.

492
00:48:31,266 --> 00:48:33,518
Motivation, Klinger, motivation!

493
00:48:34,603 --> 00:48:38,190
I'm interested in managing people;
that's where the future Iies.

494
00:48:39,608 --> 00:48:41,777
If you treat people like dirt,
they won't work.

495
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,279
And if you treat dirt like people...

496
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,370
You Jews--tricks and fakery,
that's what you're good at.

497
00:48:51,453 --> 00:48:55,082
If one scratches just a bit
at that respectable faÃ§ade...

498
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:57,459
Herr SturmbannfÃ¼hrer.

499
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:01,380
All my life I've been
an upright citizen.

500
00:49:01,463 --> 00:49:02,881
I must point out that

501
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:06,385
here I am being coerced
into performing dishonest acts.

502
00:49:20,065 --> 00:49:21,566
Excellent work, Sorowitsch.

503
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,403
Set up a new working group
for the dollar!

504
00:49:53,348 --> 00:49:54,933
Can't anyone see
what's happening?

505
00:49:56,018 --> 00:49:57,436
The Germans are bankrupt.

506
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,106
No foreign currency means
no gasoline, no raw materials.

507
00:50:01,189 --> 00:50:04,359
- We're financing the Nazi war effort!
- So?

508
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,196
Are you suggesting sabotage?
In a concentration camp?

509
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:55,494
The Americans use rotogravure,
we're using collotype...

510
00:50:55,577 --> 00:50:58,413
in order to produce
large amounts quickly.

511
00:50:59,498 --> 00:51:01,750
Collotype is good for definition
and haIftones.

512
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:07,339
There are still some problems,
but we're deaIing with them.

513
00:51:07,422 --> 00:51:11,009
ThankfuIIy we have
an expert in this field.

514
00:51:14,388 --> 00:51:16,306
A score to settle with the dollar?

515
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,850
You know it was the dollars
that led to your arrest.

516
00:51:18,934 --> 00:51:21,269
Back then, I didn't have
the technicaI means.

517
00:51:22,604 --> 00:51:23,772
And now?

518
00:51:24,606 --> 00:51:26,108
How much do you need?

519
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:29,861
Maybe a few hundred million.

520
00:51:36,952 --> 00:51:38,620
You cheap whore!

521
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,874
Just be thankful you're in here,
you idiot!

522
00:51:49,798 --> 00:51:52,300
Shit, shit, shit!

523
00:52:09,317 --> 00:52:12,404
Maybe it's not the negative
but your geIatin.

524
00:52:18,493 --> 00:52:20,745
Sorowitsch's negative
was perfect, as always.

525
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,001
But why...?

526
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,261
My wife and I were sent to Auschwitz
for printing anti-Nazi flyers.

527
00:52:38,346 --> 00:52:40,765
I'm not going to print money
for the Nazis.

528
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:49,858
Look...

529
00:52:50,692 --> 00:52:52,611
my family, small business...

530
00:52:52,694 --> 00:52:57,616
aIways carefuI, never any
problems with the authorities.

531
00:52:57,699 --> 00:53:00,785
Kept my nose out of politics.

532
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:02,871
Gisela, my wife, always said...

533
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:06,875
the reason we're printers
is to print the truth!

534
00:53:07,876 --> 00:53:09,878
Where did you learn that slogan?

535
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,882
The Communist Printers' League,
youth section?

536
00:53:17,886 --> 00:53:21,306
If we print millions of dollars,
it could decide the war.

537
00:53:21,389 --> 00:53:23,558
We could contribute to fighting
the Nazis here...

538
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,103
that wouIdn't be
just a symbolic gesture!

539
00:53:27,187 --> 00:53:28,980
We're alive.

540
00:53:29,064 --> 00:53:31,399
- That's worth a hell of a lot.
- Exactly.

541
00:53:31,483 --> 00:53:33,985
Isn't it about more
than your own shitty little life?

542
00:53:34,069 --> 00:53:36,780
Our shitty life
is the only thing we have.

543
00:53:36,863 --> 00:53:41,368
Is this about surviving, or proving
that you can forge the doIIar?

544
00:53:47,332 --> 00:53:49,334
I'll keep on
destroying your negatives.

545
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:52,837
You can squeal to Herzog
if you want.

546
00:53:56,091 --> 00:53:59,302
We'll have to pay for it
if we don't deliver!

547
00:53:59,386 --> 00:54:02,764
All of us will pay!

548
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,268
Yes.

549
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:31,710
Warsaw!

550
00:54:31,793 --> 00:54:33,587
The bastards
are being driven back!

551
00:54:49,936 --> 00:54:51,104
Carry on!

552
00:54:54,983 --> 00:54:57,819
So you're failing with the dollar?

553
00:54:58,903 --> 00:55:01,573
We're still having problems
with the geIatin,

554
00:55:01,656 --> 00:55:03,241
Herr HauptscharfÃ¼hrer.

555
00:55:03,658 --> 00:55:05,577
We can do the pound
without you now.

556
00:55:06,661 --> 00:55:09,164
And you know what you are
without the doIIar?

557
00:55:09,247 --> 00:55:11,916
Nothing but criminal
Jewish scum.

558
00:55:14,002 --> 00:55:17,422
Fuck Herzog and his "motivation."

559
00:55:20,342 --> 00:55:22,927
I'd soon make you knuckle under.

560
00:55:39,027 --> 00:55:40,612
You're such filthy swine.

561
00:55:41,696 --> 00:55:43,865
Stoop to anything
to save your wretched lives.

562
00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:47,369
Nauseating.

563
00:56:30,578 --> 00:56:31,746
Plappler.

564
00:56:32,414 --> 00:56:35,917
Get Hotte. A basin's broken--
maybe he can repair it.

565
00:56:54,102 --> 00:56:58,606
I saved aII our butts
by forging the pound for the Nazis.

566
00:57:11,619 --> 00:57:14,539
Dr. Klinger said you must eat well.

567
00:57:14,622 --> 00:57:15,790
What for?

568
00:57:19,461 --> 00:57:21,880
One for the Expressionists.

569
00:57:21,963 --> 00:57:24,716
One for the Avant-garde.

570
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,551
Eat, or I'll flatten you.

571
00:57:31,473 --> 00:57:33,558
You certainIy know
how to bring up children.

572
00:57:41,316 --> 00:57:42,901
What happened to your family?

573
00:57:47,822 --> 00:57:50,241
Deported, killed?

574
00:57:53,661 --> 00:57:56,581
I could've bought their release,
if I'd had money.

575
00:58:14,516 --> 00:58:17,519
14 to 6. Burger to serve.

576
00:58:28,154 --> 00:58:29,322
Get up!

577
00:58:31,449 --> 00:58:32,826
Keep running!

578
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,041
What's going on?

579
00:58:40,124 --> 00:58:42,335
Herr RottenfÃ¼hrer,
I was about to--

580
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,212
What are you waiting for?

581
00:58:45,213 --> 00:58:48,716
No, please not...!

582
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,729
Are you crazy, soldier?

583
00:59:01,813 --> 00:59:03,815
Stand at attention!

584
00:59:03,898 --> 00:59:05,191
Your name, cretin?

585
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,151
RottenfÃ¼hrer Wegener,
Herr HauptscharfÃ¼hrer.

586
00:59:08,903 --> 00:59:10,655
Why are you shooting here?

587
00:59:10,738 --> 00:59:14,409
What if you'd hit one of my Jews?

588
00:59:17,745 --> 00:59:18,913
Play!

589
00:59:20,415 --> 00:59:21,791
15 to 6.

590
00:59:26,254 --> 00:59:29,340
It's a concentration camp.
Dozens are murdered here every day.

591
00:59:29,424 --> 00:59:30,925
Let's just stop up our ears!

592
00:59:33,595 --> 00:59:34,762
16 to 6.

593
00:59:41,436 --> 00:59:42,770
One of thousands.

594
00:59:43,938 --> 00:59:46,858
Just be thankfuI we're
on this side of the wall, Sally.

595
00:59:55,617 --> 00:59:58,661
Look at that!

596
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:17,013
If you don't survive here
why survive at aII?

597
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:47,502
Atze has just told me why we still have
no results after so many months.

598
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:51,255
The gelatin, Herr SturmbannfÃ¼hrer.
It melts.

599
01:00:51,339 --> 01:00:52,507
Oh, yes!

600
01:00:54,676 --> 01:00:57,178
I've aIready heard that Iie
from the other Jew there.

601
01:01:07,021 --> 01:01:08,773
Are you trying to sabotage?

602
01:01:14,195 --> 01:01:15,905
- We're doing everything--
- HoId your tongue!

603
01:01:15,989 --> 01:01:18,157
Don't think you're irreplaceable!

604
01:01:24,539 --> 01:01:25,707
Right.

605
01:01:26,874 --> 01:01:28,626
Berlin is demanding the dollar.

606
01:01:29,877 --> 01:01:31,004
Those five there.

607
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,588
Klinger, take down their names!

608
01:01:32,672 --> 01:01:34,632
If there's no dollar in four weeks,

609
01:01:34,716 --> 01:01:37,635
those five will be shot
and five others selected.

610
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:39,637
Not Sorowitsch, that one.

611
01:01:41,055 --> 01:01:43,808
Don't believe
I can't dispense with you.

612
01:01:46,728 --> 01:01:47,895
By the way, Klinger.

613
01:01:51,566 --> 01:01:54,318
It's Carnival time!
What about having an evening's fun,

614
01:01:54,402 --> 01:01:57,822
with music, dancing,
cabaret, a knees-up!

615
01:01:57,905 --> 01:02:00,241
I'm sure a few talented men
can be found!

616
01:02:02,076 --> 01:02:03,494
Herr SturmbannfÃ¼hrer!

617
01:02:03,578 --> 01:02:06,748
I've always done my best.

618
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:20,845
He won't kill anyone. He's got to deliver,
so he's blackmailing us.

619
01:02:20,928 --> 01:02:24,307
- What would you do in his position?
- Me in his position?

620
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,684
I'd never be in the position
of an SS criminaI.

621
01:02:49,957 --> 01:02:51,125
It's Burger.

622
01:02:52,293 --> 01:02:54,212
I suspect he's deliberately...

623
01:02:55,963 --> 01:02:57,548
Yesterday I saw him...

624
01:02:57,632 --> 01:03:00,218
- He's sabotaging them. I know.
- What?

625
01:03:01,969 --> 01:03:04,013
But if he doesn't stop...

626
01:03:10,144 --> 01:03:11,729
Herzog saved our lives.

627
01:03:11,813 --> 01:03:13,231
He plays fair.

628
01:03:13,314 --> 01:03:17,568
- One can talk to him.
- You'll hold your tongue, Zilinski.

629
01:03:17,652 --> 01:03:20,571
- One doesn't betray one's mates.
- Mates?

630
01:03:20,655 --> 01:03:23,908
We're to die for the ideaIs
of that shitty political ideologue?

631
01:03:26,994 --> 01:03:28,579
Sit down.

632
01:03:30,164 --> 01:03:31,666
Burger the hero!

633
01:03:33,501 --> 01:03:36,462
He's always determined
to play the martyr.

634
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:38,464
That's fine for him,
but not with me!

635
01:03:41,843 --> 01:03:44,595
I lost four toes to frostbite
in BuchenwaId.

636
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:46,764
They broke my back in Dachau.

637
01:03:46,848 --> 01:03:49,600
More than once
I nearly died of starvation.

638
01:03:49,684 --> 01:03:52,728
I deserve to survive this too!

639
01:03:52,812 --> 01:03:55,356
One never squeals on one's mates.

640
01:03:56,691 --> 01:03:57,859
Never!

641
01:03:58,442 --> 01:03:59,944
What's this?

642
01:04:01,028 --> 01:04:02,530
Jailbirds' honor?

643
01:04:10,538 --> 01:04:12,874
If you betray him, I'll kill you.

644
01:04:28,723 --> 01:04:31,475
We've delayed the dollar by months.

645
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:33,477
You've had your fun.

646
01:04:33,561 --> 01:04:36,480
But now our mates' lives
are at stake.

647
01:04:36,564 --> 01:04:37,815
You can't just...

648
01:04:41,861 --> 01:04:42,862
Gisela...

649
01:04:44,655 --> 01:04:45,823
my wife.

650
01:04:50,077 --> 01:04:51,621
She was in Auschwitz too.

651
01:04:54,081 --> 01:04:55,416
Shot trying to escape.

652
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:58,002
I'm...

653
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:00,588
You're sorry?

654
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,928
Thanks.

655
01:05:17,605 --> 01:05:18,689
But now it's the dollar!

656
01:05:21,943 --> 01:05:23,110
We have to go on.

657
01:05:25,446 --> 01:05:26,614
It's a matter of...

658
01:05:27,281 --> 01:05:29,200
our comfortable life here.

659
01:05:29,283 --> 01:05:31,494
Of these fine beds.
These fine...

660
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:33,287
soft beds!

661
01:05:53,307 --> 01:05:55,101
I thought I'd be able to cry.

662
01:06:10,825 --> 01:06:12,159
Serious but stable.

663
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,912
A race against time.

664
01:06:14,996 --> 01:06:16,747
But without medication...

665
01:06:16,831 --> 01:06:18,249
What do you need?

666
01:06:20,334 --> 01:06:22,920
- But how...?
- The drugs!

667
01:06:25,339 --> 01:06:26,841
In Theresienstadt...

668
01:06:27,842 --> 01:06:29,427
there were never enough drugs.

669
01:06:30,511 --> 01:06:33,931
I had to decide...

670
01:06:35,016 --> 01:06:36,350
who was healed...

671
01:06:38,019 --> 01:06:39,603
and who died.

672
01:06:46,027 --> 01:06:48,988
Herzog's a crook.
I know how to handle him.

673
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:01,876
Need an invitation, or what?

674
01:07:25,232 --> 01:07:27,234
How nice that you could come!

675
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,822
For goodness' sake
take the handcuffs off him.

676
01:07:33,407 --> 01:07:34,575
Chilly, isn't it?

677
01:07:40,998 --> 01:07:45,419
How I wish certain East Coast circles
in America couId see you!

678
01:07:45,503 --> 01:07:47,963
You've no idea
of the dreadful propaganda

679
01:07:48,047 --> 01:07:49,840
being circulated about the camps!

680
01:07:50,591 --> 01:07:52,968
Friedrich, do pour Herr Soritsch
another cup of tea!

681
01:07:54,053 --> 01:07:57,348
Do you take candy sugar--
as a Jew?

682
01:07:57,431 --> 01:08:00,351
Friedrich told me you were
a dangerous criminal...

683
01:08:00,434 --> 01:08:01,560
and now?

684
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:03,687
Serving a noble cause!

685
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:06,107
I don't understand anything
about poIitics, but...!

686
01:08:06,607 --> 01:08:08,067
Now, children...

687
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,070
we must leave Daddy
and his visitor aIone.

688
01:08:17,952 --> 01:08:19,620
Leni, Lotte...

689
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:21,705
and little Friedrich.

690
01:08:23,624 --> 01:08:24,875
Bringing up children...

691
01:08:27,461 --> 01:08:30,047
making responsible individuals
of them,

692
01:08:30,131 --> 01:08:31,549
who take charge of their lives.

693
01:08:32,633 --> 01:08:34,885
I don't hit my children.

694
01:08:34,969 --> 01:08:36,387
Ever.

695
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:37,888
Words are enough...

696
01:08:39,306 --> 01:08:41,225
and setting
a good example oneself.

697
01:08:42,476 --> 01:08:44,061
That's what counts, Sorowitsch.

698
01:08:50,151 --> 01:08:52,236
After aII, who knows
what the future will bring?

699
01:08:56,157 --> 01:08:57,408
If the Russians come...

700
01:08:58,993 --> 01:09:02,580
one will just have to fight anew
for one's pIace in society.

701
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:05,374
Do you know...

702
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:09,628
I used to be--a Iong,
long time ago--a Communist.

703
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:14,592
Liberty, equality, human rights--

704
01:09:14,675 --> 01:09:16,093
the whole caboodle!

705
01:09:16,177 --> 01:09:18,512
And don't get the idea
that I'm a Nazi!

706
01:09:18,596 --> 01:09:20,097
No, no.

707
01:09:21,098 --> 01:09:23,017
No more grand ideals.

708
01:09:24,018 --> 01:09:26,270
I do my work where I'm needed.

709
01:09:26,353 --> 01:09:27,438
Do you understand?

710
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:30,441
Everyone has to look out
for himseIf.

711
01:09:33,694 --> 01:09:35,112
You must produce the dollar!

712
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:38,407
Any longer and I can't--

713
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:43,829
I know about the sabotage.
I know you won't betray your friends.

714
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:45,247
But I must deliver the goods.

715
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:47,708
Whatever the price.

716
01:10:08,562 --> 01:10:09,897
Who's it for?

717
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,360
And then I get the dollar?

718
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:17,863
You Jews!

719
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,783
You'd even bargain
with a comrade's life!

720
01:10:27,414 --> 01:10:30,000
By the way, that Burger--

721
01:10:30,084 --> 01:10:31,835
Absolutely trustworthy.

722
01:10:31,919 --> 01:10:33,712
Collotype.
Our most important man.

723
01:10:48,269 --> 01:10:50,020
OnIy six days Ieft.
Will you do the dollar?

724
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:56,527
Leibowitz is a rotogravure printer.
Show him how, so you don't have to--

725
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:57,778
No, Zilinski.

726
01:10:57,861 --> 01:10:59,780
We have a responsibility

727
01:10:59,863 --> 01:11:02,366
towards our families
and our comrades...

728
01:11:02,449 --> 01:11:06,870
- because we've got it so good.
- I can't listen to this crap any longer!

729
01:11:09,623 --> 01:11:12,334
So you decide
that we get ourselves shot?

730
01:11:12,418 --> 01:11:13,711
It's the principle.

731
01:11:13,794 --> 01:11:16,547
Nobody's prepared
to die for a principle.

732
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:18,757
That's why the Nazis'
system works!

733
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:27,433
You will do the fucking dollar!

734
01:13:05,572 --> 01:13:06,740
Well...

735
01:13:07,741 --> 01:13:11,328
let's see what progress
has been made.

736
01:13:18,252 --> 01:13:19,503
Herr SturmbannfÃ¼hrer...

737
01:13:21,088 --> 01:13:23,507
we're still having problems
with the geIatin.

738
01:13:24,925 --> 01:13:28,220
Herr SturmbannfÃ¼hrer,
no, it's like this.

739
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:29,471
Burger...

740
01:13:38,772 --> 01:13:41,191
See if you can tell
which are the genuine ones.

741
01:13:54,621 --> 01:13:56,123
The dollar!

742
01:13:57,124 --> 01:13:58,292
That is brilliant!

743
01:13:59,042 --> 01:14:00,461
Your masterpiece!

744
01:14:02,796 --> 01:14:07,468
Using collotype we could produce
a miIIion a week?

745
01:14:10,429 --> 01:14:12,890
Now that is a nice surprise
for CarnivaI!

746
01:14:30,824 --> 01:14:33,327
I knew you could be relied upon!

747
01:14:45,756 --> 01:14:47,591
Ladies and gentlemen,

748
01:14:47,674 --> 01:14:54,473
let me give you a very warm welcome
to our 1945 Carnival Show.

749
01:14:55,015 --> 01:14:58,227
From the worId's
most expensive stage!

750
01:15:35,722 --> 01:15:38,308
Try not to cough
when Herzog's around.

751
01:16:09,756 --> 01:16:12,050
You always wanted colors!

752
01:16:42,873 --> 01:16:44,249
Listen...

753
01:16:48,128 --> 01:16:50,964
here's another one...

754
01:16:52,049 --> 01:16:56,595
you've not heard this one yet.

755
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:59,640
A nun goes to the gynecologist
with a hamster...

756
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:03,101
Wait, I haven't finished yet!

757
01:17:04,603 --> 01:17:07,814
That you all owe your lives to me,
for getting you out of...

758
01:17:08,815 --> 01:17:10,984
- Auschwitz, Mauthausen...
- The drugs?

759
01:17:15,822 --> 01:17:18,241
Name, place of birth, in capitals.

760
01:17:18,325 --> 01:17:21,161
SWISS PASSPORT

761
01:17:25,332 --> 01:17:27,542
Put "Jew" as well,
to be on the safe side.

762
01:17:30,003 --> 01:17:32,673
You shouId take care
you don't get infected.

763
01:17:34,174 --> 01:17:38,470
Ultimately, your survival
is what it's aII about!

764
01:17:45,686 --> 01:17:47,187
These are difficult times.

765
01:17:48,689 --> 01:17:50,357
It's no longer easy for me either.

766
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:09,793
Wonderful!

767
01:18:11,712 --> 01:18:13,130
This will give us a chance.

768
01:18:14,381 --> 01:18:15,716
Where's Kolya?

769
01:18:51,168 --> 01:18:52,711
How old are you?

770
01:18:54,588 --> 01:18:55,756
Twenty.

771
01:18:56,757 --> 01:18:58,091
And where are you from?

772
01:18:59,092 --> 01:19:00,260
Odessa.

773
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:03,680
The Black Sea, how lovely.

774
01:19:04,765 --> 01:19:05,932
Kneel down.

775
01:19:42,302 --> 01:19:44,054
Karloff had TB,

776
01:19:44,137 --> 01:19:47,224
a very dangerous,
infectious disease.

777
01:19:47,307 --> 01:19:50,393
He was endangering
the heaIth of you aII,

778
01:19:50,477 --> 01:19:52,562
so I had to shoot him.

779
01:19:53,146 --> 01:19:55,816
For your own good, lads!

780
01:19:56,817 --> 01:19:58,985
We smoked a cigarette together.

781
01:20:00,153 --> 01:20:02,572
He knew
what was going to happen.

782
01:20:02,656 --> 01:20:06,076
I teII you,
he was really brave.

783
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:07,285
A Jew...

784
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:09,663
but he died like a man!

785
01:20:11,665 --> 01:20:14,084
But now, let's forget about it!

786
01:20:14,167 --> 01:20:17,087
SturmbannfÃ¼hrer Herzog
has had to leave,

787
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:20,257
but he left me these to give you.

788
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:22,676
So let's thank him for that
with three cheers!

789
01:20:29,516 --> 01:20:30,684
Carry on as you were!

790
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:55,518
Stop work!

791
01:21:55,602 --> 01:21:58,647
Stop work immediately!
Dismantle the machines!

792
01:22:01,233 --> 01:22:03,860
The Exakt platen press,
the rotopress,

793
01:22:03,944 --> 01:22:06,696
and the Boston press
must be Ioaded first.

794
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:08,281
We must find out--

795
01:22:08,782 --> 01:22:11,034
Didn't I express myself
cIearIy enough?

796
01:22:11,117 --> 01:22:13,536
I said dismantle the machines!

797
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:16,873
You've got exactIy six days
to dismantle and pack everything!

798
01:22:16,957 --> 01:22:20,752
Anything not working afterwards
counts as sabotage!

799
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:23,213
What's wrong with you?
Get them moving!

800
01:22:23,296 --> 01:22:25,382
Standing there
like stuffed dummies.

801
01:22:25,465 --> 01:22:28,051
The Exakt platen press,

802
01:22:28,134 --> 01:22:31,888
the rotopress, and the Boston press
must be loaded first.

803
01:22:31,972 --> 01:22:35,558
Herr HauptscharfÃ¼hrer,
where are we being moved?

804
01:22:35,642 --> 01:22:38,979
How dare you?
Think we're a travel agency?

805
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,314
Are you stupid, or what?

806
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:43,525
A stupid fucking Jew!

807
01:22:48,655 --> 01:22:50,824
Hurry up!

808
01:23:02,168 --> 01:23:03,753
Those aren't aircraft bombs.

809
01:23:06,673 --> 01:23:08,508
They're not aircraft bombs,
it's artillery!

810
01:23:09,509 --> 01:23:11,011
The Allies are outside Berlin!

811
01:23:17,517 --> 01:23:19,519
If the war's ending, they'll kill us.

812
01:23:39,456 --> 01:23:40,623
Lads!

813
01:23:42,042 --> 01:23:45,170
The machines wiII be
taken to a safe hiding place.

814
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:46,546
Secret caves in the Alps.

815
01:23:48,214 --> 01:23:49,424
You'll be following on.

816
01:23:57,057 --> 01:23:58,224
Hand these out to the men!

817
01:23:59,225 --> 01:24:00,393
Don't worry, men!

818
01:24:01,394 --> 01:24:03,229
We'll all be fine
come the Final Victory!

819
01:24:42,268 --> 01:24:43,520
The shoe-testing squad.

820
01:24:45,271 --> 01:24:46,439
They're not there anymore.

821
01:25:28,314 --> 01:25:29,482
What are you doing here?

822
01:25:31,317 --> 01:25:35,071
I forgot something.

823
01:25:35,155 --> 01:25:36,739
Sorowitsch, I warn you.

824
01:25:36,823 --> 01:25:39,742
If I'm harmed,
you'll all be liquidated!

825
01:25:39,826 --> 01:25:41,578
I'm your only chance of surviving!

826
01:25:52,505 --> 01:25:53,673
Do you want the money?

827
01:25:55,508 --> 01:25:56,926
We can share the money!

828
01:26:00,013 --> 01:26:01,264
Is it about Kolya?

829
01:26:03,183 --> 01:26:04,767
It was Holst who shot him!

830
01:26:04,851 --> 01:26:08,438
I know you think
Holst was only following orders.

831
01:26:08,521 --> 01:26:09,856
But what do you think I did?

832
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:15,945
I always treated you well!

833
01:26:16,029 --> 01:26:18,281
No other prisoners
were treated so well as here!

834
01:26:19,699 --> 01:26:21,868
I can't save the entire
Jewish race on my own!

835
01:26:25,872 --> 01:26:28,291
One has to look after oneself.

836
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:30,877
You know that better than anyone.

837
01:26:39,219 --> 01:26:41,638
You've pissed yourself.

838
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:45,451
What's happened here, Sally?

839
01:27:46,452 --> 01:27:47,620
Herzog.

840
01:27:48,705 --> 01:27:52,041
- You haven't...?
- I wanted to kill him, but...

841
01:27:53,543 --> 01:27:54,961
I let him go.

842
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:02,510
They'll put us up against a wall.

843
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:10,727
That would've suited you,
wouIdn't it?

844
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:12,604
If they'd shot you too.

845
01:28:15,231 --> 01:28:16,899
It's over.

846
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:19,152
The war's over.

847
01:28:20,987 --> 01:28:22,572
No one will come for us now.

848
01:28:24,324 --> 01:28:27,201
I'm just not cut out
to pIay the martyr.

849
01:28:27,285 --> 01:28:28,453
Got any cards?

850
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:44,093
Our people have taken over
the camp! This is the end.

851
01:28:44,177 --> 01:28:45,511
We're free!

852
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:49,349
Dr. Klinger, internal medicine.

853
01:28:50,933 --> 01:28:54,270
We're the inmates
from Blocks 18 and 19.

854
01:28:54,354 --> 01:28:56,522
I know him! He's SS!

855
01:28:56,606 --> 01:28:58,608
No, no, no!

856
01:28:58,691 --> 01:29:01,069
Operation Bernhard.

857
01:29:01,194 --> 01:29:03,738
- We're prisoners!
- Mow them down, the scum!

858
01:29:03,821 --> 01:29:04,947
We're Jews.

859
01:29:05,031 --> 01:29:06,282
Shoot them, the fat pigs!

860
01:29:06,366 --> 01:29:08,117
Here!
Jewish nose, big ears!

861
01:29:08,201 --> 01:29:09,827
Don't shoot.
We're prisoners.

862
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:11,329
Here, Auschwitz!

863
01:29:13,164 --> 01:29:14,749
Who else was in Auschwitz?

864
01:30:17,061 --> 01:30:21,023
We let the negatives
for the dollar overheat,

865
01:30:21,107 --> 01:30:23,609
to make the contours blur.

866
01:30:24,736 --> 01:30:26,946
They threatened to shoot us.

867
01:30:27,947 --> 01:30:30,032
This is Burger!
He's a hero!

868
01:30:30,116 --> 01:30:31,617
Say something!

869
01:30:33,202 --> 01:30:35,538
And then it was too late!

870
01:30:35,621 --> 01:30:37,874
The dollar would have changed
the course of the war.

871
01:30:37,957 --> 01:30:41,043
They'd have had heaps of dough.

872
01:30:43,755 --> 01:30:46,299
Sometimes we heard
that IoveIy music.

873
01:30:56,225 --> 01:31:00,146
We made the pound here.

874
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:01,397
Clever, eh?

875
01:31:19,123 --> 01:31:21,125
I told him he had to keep going.

876
01:31:24,128 --> 01:31:25,463
I only said...

877
01:31:25,546 --> 01:31:27,757
he had to survive
until it was over.

878
01:31:30,676 --> 01:31:31,803
What an idiot.

879
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:33,221
Best get away from here.

880
01:31:36,182 --> 01:31:37,600
Forget all about it!

881
01:31:45,858 --> 01:31:50,863
Where do I take him?
He's dead.

882
01:32:09,757 --> 01:32:11,092
Full house.

883
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:24,188
Full house.

884
01:33:30,713 --> 01:33:31,881
To change?

885
01:33:31,964 --> 01:33:33,966
No, for the staff.

886
01:33:40,973 --> 01:33:43,559
May I offer you a bottIe
of champagne on the house?

887
01:34:08,834 --> 01:34:10,920
You had bad luck?

888
01:34:17,677 --> 01:34:19,261
So much money!

889
01:34:29,522 --> 01:34:31,107
So much money!

890
01:34:32,024 --> 01:34:34,193
We can always
make us some more.

891
01:34:39,699 --> 01:34:42,368
The Sachsenhausen
counterfeiting workshop

892
01:34:42,451 --> 01:34:44,870
forged pouNd Notes to
a total value of Â£132 MillioN...
