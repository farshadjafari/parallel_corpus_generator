00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,520
- Hi. Hi, hi.
- Hey.

3
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,760
- You must be...
- Bill.

4
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,880
- Yeah.
- Hi.

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,920
Hi. Becky. Hi.

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,160
Thanks for having dinner so early.
I know it's... it's a pain.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,760
No, that's, that's...

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,320
Interesting crowd.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
Yeah. My job is the problem.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,560
I'm... I work at
Good Morning, New Jersey and...

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,800
- Right, on channel nine. Right?
- Right. Yeah.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,400
So, yeah, we're on really early, so I...
I go to bed really early and

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,760
we used to be on at, 5am,
but then we got bought by this

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,120
giant company and they wanted
to run us instead of infomercials.

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,280
'Cause we generate
slightly more revenue and...

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,160
Now we're on at four.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,120
Sorry, I'm gonna turn this off.
It's so...

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,120
Sorry. That's like, oh, my God,
that's so annoying

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,320
when people do this.
It's like, "check, please."

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,160
I'm not gonna touch this...
ever again. Sorry.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,200
No, that's, it's... it's OK.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,400
It's OK.

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,000
I...

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,920
I'm... I'm really glad that
you picked this place. I...

25
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,960
You know, it kind of reminds me
of Matthews in Waldwick.

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,640
They have the most amazing, like,
delicious, thick, big, juicy...

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,080
Lots of Belgian waffles
and syrup in the...

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,320
And...

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,400
Anyway... boring!

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,160
What do you do?

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,840
- Anna told me you're in...
- Marketing.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,680
- Right.
- For an insurance company,

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,760
and I dabble in ceramics, but...

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,880
Take it.

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,480
Sorry, it's... I... This is my boss.

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,440
- Go ahead. Take it.
- Really?

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,600
- Yeah.
- OK, great, thanks.

38
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,360
Just be a sec. Promise.

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,320
Hi! Yeah, yeah.

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,800
I left three messages
for his attorney. I don't know.

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,720
If he doesn't call me back, I'm gonna...
I'll wait outside his office.

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,840
- Good morning, Becky.
- 'Night, Jim.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,640
Good morning, New Jersey,
it's 2am.

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,080
We cover the Garden State
from corner to corner.

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,560
...the perfect alternative...

46
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,200
New Jersey Transit is reporting
a 20-minute delay...

47
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,080
...come out in support
of your local eateries.

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,440
Powerball Lottery Jackpot...

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,960
Right in the base...

50
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,800
Yes, but I did it in
a really adorable way.

51
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,240
Rent a mini-rig. Cheaper and we can
get closer to the action.

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,600
I was thinking we'd get someone
in the winner's circle.

53
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,960
A piñata?
You can do the piñata?

54
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,480
- I can do it.
- Yeah? OK.

55
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,560
- Four... three...
- Thank you, thank you.

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,280
Ready to dissolve to jib.
Jib, ready to make your move.

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Ten seconds to air,
everybody.

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,240
Ready to roll track
and fade up under one.

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,120
...three, two... one.

60
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,760
Roll track and fade up under one.

61
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,760
Good morning, New Jersey.
4:38 if you're just waking up.

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,400
A quick look at traffic now.

63
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,760
Holland Tunnel is backed up
'cause of an overturned big rig

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,040
in the right and center lanes.

65
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,640
Officials say this should be cleared up
in about an hour.

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,880
So then, expect delays
from Ridgefield Park.

67
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,320
- But until then, you should...
- Is that snoring?

68
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,720
Jesus. Not again. Can you
go to the single of Ralph?

69
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,120
- Harry, Harry.
- The Deko!

70
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,680
- Wrong lower third!
- The Deko!

71
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,040
...the hidden dangers
that could be in your home.

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,320
All that and a look at sports
at the top of the hour.

73
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,040
Stick with us here
at Good Morning, New Jersey.

74
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,360
Oh, my God.

75
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,400
- Nice shot. You're a stud.
- No problemo.

76
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,840
Rain will fall
when you go to the mall

77
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,320
Later will clear,
the sun will appear

78
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,640
Overnight low is 50
Move your rear

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,840
Hey, ho, whoo

80
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,840
- Hey.
- Hi.

81
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,320
Hey, I talked to Raymond in HR.
He said the company's reorganizing

82
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,880
all the stations and they've budgeted
us for a new senior producer.

83
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,680
They pulled your employment records.
You're getting it, Becky.

84
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,200
You're finally getting the job.

85
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,640
Hey, kiddo, can you come by my office
after the show?

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,640
- Oh, me.
- No, not me, you.

87
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Yes.

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,000
The puppy, a Chinese crested is worth
over $600 and answers to the...

89
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,840
Make your move, jib,
make your move...

90
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,160
And in Newark today,
police arrested 12 members of...

91
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,440
What? What's going on?
What is that?

92
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,440
We thought you might need this.

93
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,200
That better not be a box of condoms
again and I didn't even use the old one.

94
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,520
No, you're gonna use this.

95
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Oh, my God.

96
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,200
- Congratulations.
- Congrats.

97
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,680
That's so sweet.

98
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,840
Becky, we have to let you go.

99
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,520
I'm really sorry about this, kiddo.

100
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,240
Corporate wants us
to reduce our overhead.

101
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,880
We're having to make big cuts and they
want me to hire a senior producer

102
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,760
with more business experience to
manage the contraction of the show.

103
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
But wait a second. You told them
you can't do that, right?

104
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,400
Because I... I've been here so long
and I've worked so hard.

105
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,280
His name is Chip.

106
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,000
He's... Chip starts Monday.

107
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,200
He has an M.B.A. and
a journalism degree from Columbia.

108
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,880
They're grooming him to run
the whole station in a few years.

109
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,200
In the meantime, I can't afford
to keep you both.

110
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,280
- Becky, look, I'm really...
- Oh, shit.

111
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.
Shitty...

112
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,440
Becky, I... I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

113
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,760
- I fought them as hard as I could.
- There's lots of terrific

114
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,800
opportunities out there, you know?
I mean, look at Chip. He got one.

115
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,840
So maybe this is just the push
I need, you know?

116
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,280
So it can get me to the next level,
maybe even to a network or...

117
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,640
- Yeah.
- I mean, it's not like

118
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,520
it's my whole life.
It's only work, right?

119
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,400
Did you get any severance?

120
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,400
There were some budgetary cuts
last year,

121
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,480
so they weren't really offering.

122
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,600
But I have feelers out. Lots.

123
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,000
- Yeah, great.
- Honey, you think the Today show

124
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,160
is gonna call you up and hand you a job,
you have since you were eight,

125
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,240
- and it's not gonna happen.
- I don't, I know that, I do, I get it.

126
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,840
This is partly my fault. I...

127
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,720
I let your father get your hopes up.

128
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,200
He was not a happy person,
let's face it.

129
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,200
When he saw you aim high, he started
to feel better about himself,

130
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,960
- so I never said anything.
- What are you saying?

131
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,680
You had a dream, you know? Great.

132
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,600
When you were eight, it was adorable.

133
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,560
When you were 18, it was inspiring.

134
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,280
At 28, it's officially embarrassing.

135
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,960
And I just want you to stop
before we get to heartbreaking.

136
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,920
The troops are involved in proJects...

137
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,920
Waiting arrival...

138
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,040
On my BlackBerry,
it shows that you got my e-mail,

139
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,600
so I was just wondering if... Yeah,
it shows when someone's opened it.

140
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,720
Hello?

141
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,160
Becky Fuller. Yeah.

142
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,200
I wanted to make sure that you got
the resume that I e-mailed you.

143
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
You did. Great.

144
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,440
Becky Fuller again.
I was just wondering if...

145
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,080
Yes, I did call yesterday,
but I updated my resume last night

146
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
and thought you might...

147
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm calling because I was
checking up on the position

148
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,480
and I was wondering if it had been...

149
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,520
- Hi, Becky Fuller.
- Hi.

150
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,800
Hi, this is Jerry Barnes calling
from IBS in New York. How are you?

151
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,960
- Good.
- Terrific. Listen, I'm calling

152
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,000
'cause I received your resume,
all five of them, actually.

153
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,360
And it Just so happens,

154
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,800
that we're looking for somebody
at the moment.

155
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,120
I'll take it.

156
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,600
Well, wait, I haven't
told you what it is yet.

157
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,480
- Sorry.
- Well, our morning show

158
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,240
- has a vacancy and so...
- I'll take it!

159
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,600
We're interviewing a bunch of people.
Maybe you can come in

160
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,200
- and we can have a talk.
- Sure! Absolutely.

161
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,120
Just tell me where to go
and who to talk to.

162
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,680
OK, I'll get you an e-mail with the
details of where we are in the city.

163
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
- Sorry!
- And shall we say 3:00?

164
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,320
Thank you, thank you!

165
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,240
Oscar says you're very talented
and you work incredibly hard.

166
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,280
Says you're the most promising
producer that he's ever fired.

167
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,680
Well, that's, that's good. I think.

168
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,880
So you're a fan
of our morning program?

169
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,000
- Yeah, I think it has so many...
- Yeah, yeah, we know it's terrible.

170
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,240
Perpetually in fourth place behind
the Today show, Good Morning America

171
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,320
and that thing on CBS,
whatever it's called.

172
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,760
It's a source of constant humiliation.

173
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,520
Last year, in the network softball
league, the CBS team wore hats

174
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,400
that said,
"At least we're not Daybreak."

175
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,320
The anchors of the show
are difficult and semi-talented.

176
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,800
- I think Colleen Peck is a pro.
- Heinous.

177
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,640
- Paul McVee is a fine reporter.
- Foul.

178
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,880
OK. Is Daybreak a shitty show? Yes.

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,400
But it's on a network.
And not just any network.

180
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,880
This is one of the most legendary
news divisions in the entire history

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,520
of television! Daybreak just needs
someone who believes in it,

182
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,880
who understands that a national
platform is an invaluable resource,

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,800
that no story is too low
or too high to reach for!

184
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,040
Are you gonna... sing?

185
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,840
Look, Mr. Barnes. Jerry.

186
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,440
Daybreak's facilities are antiquated.

187
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,560
It's understaffed, underfunded.
And the pay.

188
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
It's awful, about half

189
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,120
of what you made at
Hey, How The Hell Are You, New Jersey?

190
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,720
You've never been an
executive producer. You're too young.

191
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,160
Nobody's ever heard of ya. And here,
your education, three, not four years,

192
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,240
at Fairleigh Dickinson in Teaneck,

193
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,840
also known as Fairly Ridiculous.
Did I miss anything?

194
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,560
Daybreak needs what I need,

195
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,960
someone who believes
that it can succeed.

196
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,160
Trust me, I know you don't
have any reason to believe in me,

197
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,840
but I work harder than anyone else.

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,600
I'm in first, I'm out last.

199
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,360
I know a shitload more about the news
than someone whose daddy paid them

200
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,920
to smoke bongs
and talk semiotics at Harvard

201
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,080
and I devote myself completely
to my job. It's what I do.

202
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,560
It's all I am. I...

203
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,640
You can ask anyone.

204
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,280
Well, that's... embarrassing.

205
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
OK.

206
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,920
Thanks for the tour,

207
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,160
and... thanks for... for...

208
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,720
Thanks.

209
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,640
It's these buttons right here.

210
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,360
Oh, lobby. Yes, thanks.

211
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,600
Good day so far?

212
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,080
I don't think so.

213
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,800
I talked too much. Ruined it.

214
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,000
Damn it.

215
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,920
Sir.

216
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,360
I am such a huge admirer of yours.

217
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,680
I'm a... I'm a big, huge fan. I...

218
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,640
My whole family watched you,
growing up. I...

219
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,840
Of all the anchors, you were,
by far, the greatest reporter.

220
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,520
I mean when you were
in Kosovo, I was in Kosovo.

221
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,080
- She work for you?
- No.

222
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,520
I'm just here to teach her
how to use the elevator.

223
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,800
Are you done?

224
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,160
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

225
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,800
May I?

226
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,040
Oh, God, sorry. I...

227
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,480
Of course, of course.

228
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,760
Oh, my God, I can't
believe I just met the...

229
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,080
- Wait a second. You know him.
- Yes, I do know him.

230
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,920
He's the third worst person
in the world.

231
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,720
- Hello?
- Becky Fuller.

232
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,640
- Yes?
- You sure you can do this Job?

233
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,200
Yes.

234
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,160
- You start on Monday.
- Thank you.

235
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,400
Yes, I am calling about
the one-bedroom.

236
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,960
Yes, I'm moving into town.
I've got a new job.

237
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,440
I'm extremely neat and tidy.

238
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,400
In summer camp the kids used
to pay me to make their beds.

239
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah.
Sorry, that was an overshare.

240
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,800
No loud music. No kids.

241
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,280
I don't even have a boyfriend.
Just me.

242
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,440
I'll take it. I'll take it,
I'll take it.

243
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,520
Sorry!

244
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,920
Sorry!

245
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,080
Sorry!

246
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,200
Also, we'll have more
on the flooding in lowa.

247
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,160
Finally, some good weather news
on the way for those folks.

248
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,120
So please Join us tomorrow
and thank you for spending

249
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,680
- your morning here at Daybreak.
- Take care, everyone.

250
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,920
- Are you interviewing at Daybreak?
- Goodbye.

251
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,880
Assistant? Intern?

252
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,320
No. Actually,
I'm the new executive producer.

253
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,920
Another one?

254
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,560
Don't unpack.

255
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,680
Miss Fuller?
Lenny Bergman, Senior Producer.

256
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,600
Yes. I know who you are.

257
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,400
You started out at WABC.
You were at CBS for two years

258
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,800
- and here for 13.
- Yeah, wow.

259
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,720
- Here, let me, let me give you a hand.
- I just have one question.

260
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,280
Why haven't they bumped you up?

261
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,240
It's not for me. I did it
for a couple of weeks once,

262
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,840
but they put me back at number two.
Apparently, the crying was distracting.

263
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,680
You'll love it, though.
It's a great job.

264
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,480
- Our morning meetings are at five.
- Isn't that kind of late?

265
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,920
- Late?
- I mean, it's just that...

266
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,560
I'm, I'm used to early hours, so...

267
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,400
Well, maybe we should
try better doughnuts.

268
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,520
Excuse me. At the Today show,

269
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,000
the senior staff is usually...
Hi. ...in by 4:30...

270
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,840
We're just like the Today show,
except, you know, without the money,

271
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,240
- viewers, respect. But very similar.
- OK.

272
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,080
OK? That's...
that's one of our good doorknobs.

273
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,560
Let me take care of this.

274
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,080
Colleen Peck has been here forever.
Don't mention that.

275
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,880
But McVee is paid more.
Don't mention that, either.

276
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,600
They hate each other.
Don't mention that.

277
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,560
But that's because Colleen hates
everybody. Don't mention that.

278
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,000
And she used to sleep with McVee,
who threw her over for her assistant.

279
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,560
- Do not mention that.
- Got it.

280
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,400
- After you talk to Colleen...
- Yeah, yeah?

281
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,680
Make sure you get me before you talk
to McVee, so I can go with ya.

282
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,200
- Why?
- I don't... Just trust me, OK?

283
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,800
- OK.
- OK.

284
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,000
- OK.
- Good.

285
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,920
- Can I just...
- Sure. OK, you ready?

286
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,720
- I'm ready.
- Good luck.

287
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,080
Do you know how many EP's I've had
in the past 11 years?

288
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,440
Fourteen.

289
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,520
If they're stupid, they get fired,
and if they're smart, they quit.

290
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,120
And now look what I get.

291
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Well...

292
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,600
- It's a pleasure...
- You think it's fun being

293
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,960
in last place?
Do you think I enjoy working

294
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,240
for a network that spends more
on one episode of a dating show

295
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,760
about a bachelor dwarf
than our entire weekly budget?

296
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,320
- No...
- And I've never had a decent

297
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,800
- co-anchor ever!
- We're gonna change...

298
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,000
Just a revolving door of cretinous
morons. Our ratings are in the crapper.

299
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,560
I mean, how long can this show
limp along like this?

300
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,760
I know that everyone's been through
a lot, and I know that there's been

301
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,760
so many challenges along the way.
But, you know...

302
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,040
You will fail like everyone else

303
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,680
and then you'll be gone,
like everyone else.

304
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,760
But I will still be here, pulling
the train up the hill with my teeth.

305
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,720
You think it's fun
getting your ass kicked?

306
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,720
- No...
- Welcome to Daybreak.

307
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,680
Enjoy the pain, Gidget.

308
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,520
No! It's OK. I have it!
I've done this a zillion times and...

309
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,720
- I'm gonna fix that and...
- See ya later!

310
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,120
Good talking to you.

311
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,200
Paul! Hi! I'm... I'm Becky Fuller.

312
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,960
Your new EP. Thrilled to meet you.

313
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,160
I was just thinking maybe we could
go over a few ideas.

314
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,440
I was thinking maybe we could

315
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,640
get you on the street
and do some remotes.

316
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,160
Yeah, I don't like to leave the studio.
I like climate control.

317
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,240
But, if you want, we could
discuss this further privately.

318
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,080
What size are your feet?

319
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,240
- You wear about a six and half? Seven?
- Pardon?

320
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,240
How do you feel about
having them photographed?

321
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,320
Good? Feel good about that?

322
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,000
You should.
I keep 'em very classy.

323
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,040
I... don't...

324
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,240
Can I show you my blog?
"Sexy Feet?"

325
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
- No.
- Yes?

326
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
No.

327
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,960
- I met Paul.
- You talked to him alone?

328
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,000
- I told you to come see me first.
- I know, but...

329
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,960
What was I gonna do?
Hi, everyone. Hi, I'm Becky.

330
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,640
Hi. Good morning.

331
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,760
Oh, God, look who's here.
I mean not here.

332
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,600
McVee. So shocking, huh?

333
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,600
Yeah, well, Mr. McVee doesn't
always come to these things.

334
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,600
Oh, could you tell Paul
that we need him, please? Thanks.

335
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,520
OK, so let's just dive in,
shall we?

336
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,440
Who wants to start?

337
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,240
Tomorrow Rocco DiSpirito
wants to make lasagna.

338
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,440
I told him we did that last week
with the Barefoot Contessa,

339
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,040
- but he's insisting. What do I do?
- For the segment on miniskirts,

340
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,880
- do you want all size models?
- Next week, I want to do a piece

341
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,840
on juice cleanses.
All the celebs are doing them

342
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,960
and they have amazing
powers of rejuvenization.

343
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,640
My idea is that I get a juice
cleanse and then we can, like,

344
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,160
- measure my toxins...
- For the Carville interview...

345
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,600
I'm sorry, Lisa, do you want
the living room set or the stools?

346
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,160
ABC says we can't have Eva Longoria
until two weeks after

347
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,240
- she does G.M.A. What do we do?
- On psychic animals,

348
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,160
would you prefer a parakeet
or an iguana?

349
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
I'd like to do a piece on weathervanes.
They are fascinating.

350
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,960
Like did you know the word "vane"
comes from the Old English "fana",

351
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,120
- which means flag or weathercock?
- Friday, for cooking with squash,

352
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,360
- inside or on the plaza?
- They're offering us the third

353
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,440
lead in the new Patrick Dempsey movie.
Do you want him?

354
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,520
Great story out of Tampa about
a retirement account scandal.

355
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,760
But we got to move quick. Should we
send a team or just local talent?

356
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,640
...control room's on the fritz.
Ten grand to fix it.

357
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,760
For that piece on baby food,
do we want an actual baby,

358
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,280
and if so, white, black,
Hispanic, Asian,

359
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,920
blonde hair, brown hair,
teeth, or no teeth?

360
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,960
I have a black baby at home.

361
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,520
I'm sorry, I can't hear
what you're saying. I...

362
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,400
Hello! Hi, hi. Does someone
wanna tell me why I had to log off

363
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,440
BangingGrannies.com for this?

364
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,200
Asshole.

365
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,200
Tell Rocco if he insists on making
lasagna, he will be bumped.

366
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,440
Yes, all size models,
but skirts not too short. Toxins?

367
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,240
Who said that?
They can't be measured.

368
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,720
And "rejuvenization," not a word.
Tell Longoria's people

369
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,880
that she can't plug her next film unless
we get her within a week of G.M.A.

370
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,520
Parakeet. Ernie, weathercock?
Seriously?

371
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,480
The plaza for squash.
I want Patrick Dempsey.

372
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,760
Tell his people we'll run him in
the first hour and he can talk about

373
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,360
whatever his thing is.
Tampa Bay, definitely local talent.

374
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,160
And we've got to fix that sound board.

375
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,560
Find ten grand
in the budget somewhere.

376
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,560
The hair and makeup numbers, those
were too high. So, Colleen, could you

377
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,320
share your hair person with Lisa?

378
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,000
That'd be great, great. OK.
Asian baby, no teeth.

379
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,200
- Lesbian parents.
- OK.

380
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,360
Did I miss anything?

381
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,840
Oh, Paul!

382
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,840
You're fired.

383
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,840
- You're adorable.
- Fired!

384
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,680
I'm sorry. That was unprofessional.

385
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,840
Congratulations. The first day,
you flushed your anchor

386
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,640
and you got no money
to pay for another one.

387
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,720
He was lowering the morale of the show.

388
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,440
How is that possible?

389
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,640
Look, you must have
someone under contract.

390
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,360
A local anchor, a reporter.
I'll find someone.

391
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,960
I'll promote from within.
That'll be great for morale!

392
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,360
Go nuts. Find somebody great.
It just can't cost me a penny.

393
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,560
What if I gave them one
of my three pennies?

394
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,000
Whatever it takes.
Just get the ratings up.

395
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,640
Lenny, hi. Yeah. Very positive.
He thinks we have terrific options.

396
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,560
...plunge from 200 points
right before closing.

397
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,960
- Analysts fear that this...
- He's not bad.

398
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,320
Yeah, he's OK. Put a saddle on him,
he's good to go.

399
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,080
- ...are not happy.
- Should we watch 86 again?

400
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,320
I got to get home, see the kids,
or the wife is gonna kill me.

401
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,880
You have kids?

402
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,920
What? No.

403
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,920
No? Husband? Boyfriend?

404
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,160
Me? What? No.

405
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,200
- No, I'm sorry. Stupid question.
- You know...

406
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,320
- You're hideous and repulsive.
- You know what? Forget 86.

407
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,600
I think that we should watch the Miami
guy again, 'cause he was, I mean,

408
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,960
you know, he was a little bit tan,
but I think...

409
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,920
I think that we could wipe
that off, it's probably

410
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,800
just one of those self-tanner things.
I could, you know, fix that.

411
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,160
Good night.

412
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,760
Hey, look. It's Mike Pomeroy's fangirl.

413
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,280
- Hello.
- Hey.

414
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,480
That was you.

415
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,800
That was really embarrassing.

416
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,800
I may need to have you killed.

417
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,640
I'm... I'm Becky Fuller. Sorry.

418
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,240
"Becky Fuller" Becky Fuller?

419
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,320
The one who took out McVee?
You're a legend already.

420
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
- Thanks.
- I'm Adam Bennett.

421
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,280
I'm a producer upstairs at Seven Days.

422
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,560
- Hello.
- So you lookin' for a new anchor?

423
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,240
- Yes.
- Not that guy.

424
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,400
You can't use that guy.
That's the horse guy.

425
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,240
He's not too bad. I mean,
as long as we leave our hand flat

426
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,520
when we feed him a carrot.

427
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,240
- Well, good luck, Becky Fuller.
- Thank you, Adam Bennett.

428
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,200
- Need any help?
- No. I'm good. Thanks.

429
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,840
The sports guy from St. Louis
is not bad. Let's watch him again.

430
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,360
No, we need some gravitas.
We need people to trust us.

431
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,320
I mean, if news breaks on the air, we
need to be able to cover it credibly.

432
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,000
What, do you actually think
that we can cover breaking news?

433
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,720
- God, that's adorable.
- Thousands gathered today

434
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,000
to see if the tiny buck-toothed creature
would spot his own shadow.

435
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,200
But the sad tooth is,
according to Punxsutawney Phil,

436
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,840
this bitter winter is far from over.
Back to you, Mike.

437
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,400
What?

438
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,480
Yesterday, the Secretary of State
held a top-level

439
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
- State Department security brief...
- What's funny?

440
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,760
- You put Seabiscuit back in?
- But we agree that Hezbollah

441
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,720
has shown a willingness
to continue to attack.

442
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,520
- Becky?
- Can I call you back?

443
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,040
...lsraeli incursions.

444
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,600
What steps are you taking to limit
these Hezbollah retaliations?

445
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,560
You have Pomeroy
under contract, right?

446
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,400
Yeah. He was supposed to do
stories for one of our magazine shows.

447
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,400
- Yeah?
- We couldn't use anything he pitched.

448
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,720
- Nothing?
- An eight-part story

449
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,120
on the United Nations.
An interview with a Pashtun warlord.

450
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,840
A piece on microfinance in Asia?
It's all been so tempting.

451
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,000
- Jerry!
- So we're just paying him to sit there.

452
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,840
Wait. But he must
have millions on his contract.

453
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,280
You have a world-caliber
news man with nothing to do!

454
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,360
- Becky, this is...
- No, Pomeroy has reported

455
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,560
on every major story of the last three
decades, with integrity and courage!

456
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,760
I mean, he was the only anchor to go
down to Ground Zero on the day.

457
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,120
His Q ratings, I looked at them,
they're unbelievable,

458
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,800
- and you're already paying him.
- I have to go. We'll discuss this.

459
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,400
I...

460
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,640
I want to look at his contract!

461
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,920
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hi.

462
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,600
I need your approval
to look at his contract.

463
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,520
Please.

464
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,040
Hi.

465
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,600
Hi.

466
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,720
I'm Becky Fuller and...

467
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,520
We actually met the other day
in the elevator.

468
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,520
And what the hell are you doing here?

469
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,400
I'm the producer of Daybreak and we're
actually looking for a new anchor.

470
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,720
Then why are you here?

471
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Well, it's funny that you should ask.

472
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,760
Go away.

473
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,040
OK, just hear me out, because the
show actually has a lot of potential.

474
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,480
We're starting over basically,

475
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,160
and with an anchor as esteemed
and respected as yourself...

476
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,600
You've been a journalist
your whole life, ever since

477
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,800
your elementary school paper,
The Beaverton Bee.

478
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,320
I mean, you've got to miss it. You...
News breaks, it must just kill you

479
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,040
- not to be out there.
- Morning shows don't do news.

480
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,760
Jesus, Daybreak. Half the people that
watch your show have lost their remote.

481
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,120
The other half are waiting
for their nurse to turn them over.

482
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,720
If I wanted to come back,
I could have any job I chose.

483
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,560
But you can't work on another network
for another two years.

484
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,960
So I'll continue to enjoy my life
on IBS's dime.

485
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,200
All right,
I didn't want to have to do this.

486
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,800
- I looked at your contract.
- What?

487
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,320
- With the lawyers.
- My contract?

488
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,320
You're right. They do have to pay you
for the last two years of your contract.

489
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,840
Unless six months have elapsed

490
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,800
without you appearing on the air
in any capacity.

491
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,280
Then, if the network offers
you an official position

492
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,920
and you don't take it,
they can terminate your contract

493
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,600
and the six million dollars
that you have left on it.

494
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,960
So, here's me with an official offer.

495
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,800
Mike Pomeroy, the IBS network
would like to offer you

496
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,400
the position of co-host of Daybreak.

497
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,200
- You're joking.
- No.

498
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,680
Actually, I'm not.

499
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,880
Do you have any idea
what's going on in the world?

500
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,160
And you want me to do stories
about baked Alaska?

501
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,480
After the career that I've had?

502
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,400
You just need to have an open mind.

503
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,960
- Open mind.
- I mean, yes, the morning news

504
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,560
- has a wider range of stories...
- A wider range?!

505
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,160
Your program is in the
news department, you cretin!

506
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,200
News is a sacred temple.

507
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,360
And you're part of the cabal
that's ruining it with horseshit!

508
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,880
That's not actually fair.

509
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,280
Because the first half hour of a morning
show is a damn fine news broadcast.

510
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,040
Sure, we cover news and entertainment.

511
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,760
That's everything
a newspaper has ever done.

512
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,960
There's nothing wrong with that.
Think of it this way:

513
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,000
We're like a well-informed neighbor,
coming over to chat

514
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,400
with people in the morning. You know,
Brokaw did the morning news.

515
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,080
And Charlie Gibson. Walter Cronkite
did it at the beginning of his career.

516
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,280
I mean, he co-hosted a morning program
with a puppet named Charlemagne.

517
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,880
Well, then... get a puppet.

518
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,720
It's inexpensive and uses things
you already have around the house.

519
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,400
You can make globes, hats,
especially piñatas.

520
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,080
Now, mâché means
"to chew" in French,

521
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,200
but we're not actually going
to be eating any of this, right?

522
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Of course not!

523
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,680
No.

524
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,080
Coming up next, you've heard her sing.

525
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,840
Well, today, you're going
to hear about her sweet tooth.

526
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,360
Join us as we bake brownies
with Celine Dion's personal chef.

527
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,720
All that and more,
coming up on Daybreak.

528
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,200
- We're clear!
- Oh, my God,

529
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,560
will somebody please get this off?
Thank you, thank you.

530
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,920
- Thank you very much.
- OK, so, we don't have time

531
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,360
for the sit-down, so we're just
gonna run the package, all right?

532
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,080
- Are you OK?
- What?

533
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,880
Don't beat yourself up.
He was never gonna do it. Pomeroy?

534
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,800
- How did you know that?
- Mike was never gonna come to work

535
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,600
at this little dog and pony show,
especially not working for somebody

536
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,960
- like, well, I'm sorry, but you.
- OK. Like, yeah.

537
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,520
You. Not in a thousand years. I mean,
obviously, don't get me wrong,

538
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,600
I would have... I would have
welcomed him with open arms.

539
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,240
Oh, my God.

540
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,360
I heard he was coming in,
but I didn't...

541
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,920
I've won eight Peabodys.

542
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,560
A Pulitzer.

543
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,440
Sixteen Emmys.

544
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,720
I was shot through
the forearm in Bosnia.

545
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,560
Pulled Colin Powell from a burning Jeep.

546
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,080
I laid a cool washcloth
on Mother Teresa's forehead

547
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,720
during a cholera epidemic.

548
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,680
I've had lunch with Dick Cheney.

549
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,760
You're here for the money.

550
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,560
That is correct.

551
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,960
Five, four, three...

552
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,400
Fuck.

553
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,600
Welcome back to Daybreak.

554
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,360
God, does he cook?
Does he do... I don't know,

555
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,800
fashion segments and gossip?

556
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,480
Does he have three-year-old octuplets
barf all over him like I did last year?

557
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,040
Well, unfortunately, in the '80s,

558
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,880
someone gave him
story refusal rights, so no.

559
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,520
I don't care. Does he know that
this is called morning television?

560
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,720
Yes, and I think
that after a little bit of time,

561
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,840
he's really gonna want
to do a mix of stories.

562
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,920
Face it! I'm going to end up making
turkey meatballs with Mario Batali

563
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,520
- for the rest of my natural life.
- I need the new titles ASAP.

564
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,680
OK, let's move it. Single malt. We've
got the hand soap,

565
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,240
we got the mixers, the papers,
the tropical fruit.

566
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,240
Here we go.
Whoever heard of mangosteen?

567
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,640
- Apparently, he has.
- This is Colleen's dressing room

568
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,800
and... She's so looking
forward to seeing you.

569
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,280
Good. Great. Glad to hear it.

570
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,720
And this is mine?

571
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,080
Yes, but Colleen is... Never mind.

572
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,360
You got me the newspapers?

573
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,960
The mixers?

574
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,440
The tropical fruit plate.

575
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,320
All stipulated in your ten-page rider.

576
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,440
- Nice of you.
- Yes...

577
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,760
Colleen wants me, I'll be in here.

578
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
OK.

579
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,160
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He should come in here.

580
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,680
- OK.
- What the hell is that?

581
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,960
No hurry.

582
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,120
No. No and no.

583
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
OK.

584
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,240
Did you tell her I have papaya in here?

585
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,480
He gets a tropical fruit plate?
That is just so pathetic.

586
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,120
That guy might be our only hope.

587
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,680
So I suggest you just man up
and get in there!

588
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,040
That is such a good speech!

589
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,320
Guess what? I'm not going.

590
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,320
So, we'll be shooting Mike's
promos all week and then

591
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,040
we'll finalize the format
of the show on Friday.

592
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,160
Then we'll rehearse
Mike's openings and segues.

593
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,760
Excuse me.
Who is going to say goodbye?

594
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,280
- Pardon?
- Well, at the end of the show?

595
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,040
It doesn't really matter.

596
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,560
I mean, Mike, you don't mind
if Colleen says goodbye?

597
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,520
Well, who do you think the public
would rather hear from last?

598
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,080
Someone who's won every broadcast
award on the face of the planet

599
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,000
or the former Miss Pacoima?

600
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,480
It's Arizona!

601
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,600
In case you're interested,
I was Miss Arizona!

602
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,840
Christ!

603
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,120
We can't both have our arms folded.

604
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,000
And I am the female here, I think.

605
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,840
- Colleen on this side.
- Of course, I'd be more than happy to.

606
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,120
Can you just step away,
just for a second? Thanks.

607
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,400
We don't want
to take up your precious... Hello?!

608
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,560
- Is that better?
- What's next? Bubble bath?

609
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,760
Hey. Hi!

610
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,200
- Hey.
- Hi.

611
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,920
Hey, I just came to...
to offer my condolences

612
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,360
on hiring the third
worst person in the world.

613
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,000
Thanks.

614
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,880
Yes. I...
Who are the other two?

615
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,800
Kim Jong-il
and Angela Lansbury, actually.

616
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,920
- She knows what she did.
- OK.

617
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,760
So, I... I gather that you worked
with Mike at the nightly news.

618
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,080
Worst year of my life.
The entire time we worked together,

619
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,520
the only thing he ever called me
was Señor Dipshit.

620
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
It's not funny.

621
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,320
- I'm sorry, that's not funny.
- No.

622
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,680
That's terrible.
That is terrible, actually.

623
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,920
Yeah, so...

624
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,760
So now is an excellent time
for you to take up drinking.

625
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,360
And... And I came by to say
that sometimes after work,

626
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,600
a few of us go over
to Schiller's on Madison,

627
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,200
so, you know,
if you're ever around...

628
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,920
- Around.
- Yeah, available.

629
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,280
Oh, OK. Yeah.
That... would be nice.

630
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,040
Yeah, I... I don't,
I don't really go out very much,

631
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,520
but if I'm in the neighborhood,

632
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,360
- I will definitely stop by and say hi.
- Well, like tomorrow.

633
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,400
- Around eight.
- OK. Yeah, sounds good.

634
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,200
- All right.
- Sure, yeah.

635
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,560
- Bye.
- Bye.

636
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,520
That's not too shabby.
You got a new anchor.

637
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,120
Somebody asked you out on a date.
Things are lookin' up.

638
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,920
That was... He...
Not asking me out on a date.

639
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,000
I think it was.
I was standin' right there.

640
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,960
- No, no.
- Yeah.

641
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,480
He was just mentioning that
he might be somewhere. I mean...

642
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,920
Come on, please, I think I would
know if I was being asked out on a date.

643
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,440
- It's a date.
- So, we've got the bird whisperer

644
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,280
- confirmed for Tuesday?
- Yes.

645
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,680
Great. And...
Al Green on the plaza Wednesday.

646
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,000
- Two songs.
- OK.

647
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,600
And Colleen, do you want to do
the interview between the songs?

648
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,720
No, let me.

649
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,320
Yeah, I'll do it.

650
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,880
OK. Mike, so we have this great story
on children's water safety.

651
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,480
- That's the...
- Not my thing.

652
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,560
OK, how about a rundown of the new
shows on the fall television season?

653
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,480
- Oh, yeah. That's a no.
- OK.

654
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,120
The boom in organic farming.
Very hot topic right now.

655
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,440
That's newsy, right?

656
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,680
What do you want me to do?
Fire another anchor?

657
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,560
Then we're gonna be stuck with
that guy who counts with his hooves.

658
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,440
Colleen can't do every story
that's not hard news.

659
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,280
It's Mike Pomeroy. He's a legend.
What am I supposed to tell him?

660
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,360
- There she is.
- What...? Oh, hi.

661
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,160
Interesting, Jerry hired you.

662
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,200
No polish. No pedigree.
Those bangs.

663
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,800
What was he thinking?

664
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,000
Just wondering.

665
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,080
- He's a peach.
- Yeah.

666
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,640
Coming soon to Daybreak,

667
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,400
one of the most legendary newsmen
of all time.

668
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,440
Soon, he'll be bringing his
experience to morning television.

669
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,640
Let Mike Pomeroy show you the world

670
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,720
over your first cup of coffee!

671
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,520
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- What? What, what, what is it now?

672
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,680
It's embarrassing. I mean,
what's in the briefcase?

673
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,000
- What do you mean? What?
- Special anchorman papers?

674
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,720
- It doesn't matter.
- My lunch? Where am I going?

675
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,440
- We've been over this eight times!
- I'm running to nowhere.

676
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,440
- I look like a jackass!
- No... Yes, you do.

677
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,960
You know, whoever gave you
promo approval was smoking crack!

678
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,480
- I want to meet that person.
- I was mopping the floor

679
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,160
- with Peter Jennings at the time.
- I want to have words with...

680
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,840
I could have had hookers and
eight balls written into my contract.

681
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,600
- How nice for you.
- ...over your first cup of coffee.

682
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,200
Why do we have to mention that first
cup of coffee? Why not just say,

683
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,720
"Watch Mike Pomeroy
before your morning dump?"

684
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,720
One of the most legendary newsmen...

685
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,840
So for the fashion segments, I think
it's important that we interpret

686
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,360
runway trends for our viewers because
they're not all six foot and size zero.

687
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,960
- Man, he's cute.
- I went to Yale with him.

688
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,120
- Shut up.
- You did not.

689
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,720
Everyone was madly in love with him.

690
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,240
Actually, just me and
every single person I knew.

691
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,480
- Can we just...?
- His dad was editor of Newsweek.

692
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,120
His mom's family is rich as hell.
They own like Tupperware or something.

693
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,080
He rowed crew for Yale when they won
the national championship.

694
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
Hi.

695
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,120
- You know him?
- No. Yeah, well, yes, I mean, I...

696
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,320
- Yes.
- Don't you think he's smokin'?

697
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,400
- Smokin'.
- Yeah.

698
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,480
I don't know, I don't know.
Let me see. I don't know.

699
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,520
- Not a hard question.
- He's walking away.

700
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,080
So jeans and belts.

701
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,840
You have a rash or something
spreading on your neck.

702
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,680
Well, you know,
I asked him to do a piece on Trump.

703
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,440
And he actually picked up my Diet Coke
and hurled it across the room.

704
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,200
- Wow, he picked it up.
- Just missed me. He did.

705
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,880
I asked him to cover
a bumper crop of cranberries

706
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,720
and he slapped me in the face.

707
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,600
- He did?
- It's true.

708
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,000
- Really?
- Of course, he was drunk off his ass.

709
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,160
Adam!

710
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,120
- Hi.
- Hi. How are ya?

711
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,120
- I'm good.
- Hi.

712
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,880
- You never called me!
- I'm sorry.

713
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,840
We... I was...
I've been workin' a lot.

714
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,320
Well, maybe I'll see you at
Barton's regatta party on Saturday.

715
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,000
- Great, great.
- OK, great.

716
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,320
Yeah, cool.

717
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,800
- Sorry, I was just...
- That's OK.

718
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,920
Absolutely fine. That's fine, fine.

719
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,600
- Bye.
- See you later.

720
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,080
- Yeah.
- So, anyway,

721
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,000
the reason that I came by tonight,

722
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,760
was because I don't really know
that many people who know Mike,

723
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,200
and I thought, that, you know,
I could get your professional feedback.

724
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,240
- My feedback?
- Yeah, you know.

725
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,440
I mean, 'cause I'm actually
new in town and I don't...

726
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,360
- Come on.
- No, please.

727
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,080
...have that many work contacts, so...

728
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,200
Great. So... we'll be contacts?

729
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,040
That would be great.

730
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,520
Well, you can never
have enough of those.

731
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,760
No, you can't.

732
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,640
So, definitely be seeing you around.

733
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,360
- OK.
- OK.

734
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,960
Shit.

735
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,280
OK. Good rehearsal. Good stuff.

736
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,400
So let's just alternate the
voiceover intros of the headlines.

737
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,640
- OK.
- And then ad-lib.

738
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,880
So, let's say, for example, we're doing
a story about, I don't know,

739
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,560
- a midterm election.
- But we won't.

740
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,240
Because the morning shows
don't do news.

741
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Pompous. That's really interesting.
That's a different color for you.

742
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,040
- That's...
- OK, and you two should just sort of,

743
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,440
you know, banter back and forth
a little bit.

744
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,000
Banter, from the Latin word,
meaning "to gibber like a moron?"

745
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,040
Just, you know,
talk about the headlines.

746
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,480
That's... that's what I mean.

747
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,600
I'm not gonna sit here and rehearse
like I'm in summer stock.

748
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,960
I've been on the air for 40 years,
for Christ's sake.

749
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,800
I think I know how to ad-lib.

750
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,840
The spill began
when the tanker was damaged

751
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,440
in heavy seas outside Galveston.

752
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,280
Knock, knock.

753
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,920
Can I come in?

754
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,000
I just wanted to say,

755
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,120
you know, good luck.

756
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,840
Colleen's Pap smear.

757
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,280
A television classic.

758
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,200
Are you drunk?

759
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,800
Insufficiently.

760
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,000
Current weather conditions
are complicating efforts

761
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,480
- ...to contain the...
- That's my chair.

762
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,320
What?

763
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,120
That's where I belong. There.

764
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,720
...authorities have asked
the federal government...

765
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,640
Took it away from me,
those motherfu...

766
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,360
I think maybe you should just go home...

767
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,720
- See this?
- Yes. What is that?

768
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,840
Forty-year-old Bruichladdich.

769
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,520
I only drink this
when I'm practically suicidal.

770
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,920
OK.

771
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,000
You're, you're very funny.

772
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,320
Well, I'm gonna see you tomorrow...
right?

773
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,680
...is almost impossible to calculate.

774
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,720
Hi.

775
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

776
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,880
Hi. I...

777
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,560
Sorry. I thought that I might
swing by to...

778
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,240
...see if...

779
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,760
What are you working on?

780
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,120
We're working on a piece

781
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,160
on the communist rebels
in the Philippines.

782
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,360
Good. That sounds great. So I went to
the bar the other night to see you.

783
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,720
Yeah, I could tell. By the way
you ran in the other direction.

784
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,920
Your arms, pinwheeling.

785
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,560
Yeah. OK, fair, true.

786
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,760
I think that you're sort of...

787
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,880
...comically great.

788
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,560
And I thought it seemed
so promising so I bungled it,

789
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,520
because that's what I do.
I bungle things.

790
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,040
I bungle and I ramble, and that's
kind of like what I'm doing right now,

791
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,320
talking about it.
You threw me off guard.

792
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,680
You, with your...

793
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,960
And the... and the, this...

794
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,160
And the...

795
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,920
My working on a loom?

796
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,080
- My, my...
- No.

797
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,200
- ...double-handed craps. My...
- I...

798
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,440
- My Jazzercise.
- Rowing. Rowing.

799
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,160
- Rowing?
- Championship?

800
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,080
I never would have got that.

801
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,200
But you know what I mean.

802
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,480
That I didn't think that you...
liked me.

803
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,960
But I do. Oddly.

804
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,680
You're... different.

805
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,920
And a deeply terrible mime.

806
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,640
Well, I asked you out.
Then when I saw you at the bar,

807
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,680
I practically tackled you to the ground.
What part of that was confusing?

808
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,120
Here, here, here, sit down.

809
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,080
Look, my radar for that kind of thing
is so bad.

810
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,800
I mean, I don't know if a man's
interested in me until he's naked.

811
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,680
I mean, the pants come off
and then I'm like,

812
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,240
"I guess you don't really want
to see my CD collection

813
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,520
- or talk about Kerouac."
- You're nuts.

814
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
OK, look.

815
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,480
Let's start over.

816
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,640
Let's go out to dinner
like... regular people.

817
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,520
Just take it slowly,
just see where it leads.

818
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,960
- How does that sound?
- That sounds perfect.

819
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,760
Oh, God, I should go home.

820
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,840
It's eight! It's eight already.

821
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,480
- I know.
- It's Mike's first day tomorrow.

822
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,360
- You should definitely go.
- What's the big whoop?

823
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,160
I mean, you know, he's done this
like a million times before.

824
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,600
- Yeah.
- And he knows exactly what he's doing.

825
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,120
- Yeah.
- So...

826
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,320
It's fine.

827
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,240
He didn't open a bottle of
40-year-old Bruichladdich, did he?

828
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,880
How do you know that?

829
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,480
What?

830
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,640
When I was working with him,

831
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,960
if there was something that
he didn't want to do, the Oscars,

832
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,920
the Olympics, something that people
might actually get a tiny twinge

833
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,120
of pleasure from, the night before,
he would go on a bender.

834
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,720
Call in sick for work the next day.

835
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,120
No. No, no. This is ridiculous.
I'm not...

836
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,280
I'm not going out there
and chasing him around.

837
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,880
If he wants to screw this up,
that is his problem.

838
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,120
- Start at Elaine's.
- Oh, God, thank you. Thank you.

839
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,480
I'm sorry.

840
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,480
We'll do it again sometime.

841
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,240
Thanks.

842
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,920
- Pomeroy?
- Yeah.

843
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,920
He was here.
He left about an hour ago.

844
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,280
Oh, no. The little woman.

845
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,520
- Incoming.
- Jesus Christ, Pomeroy,

846
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,480
they're getting younger and younger.

847
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,520
Mike... I need to talk to you.

848
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,680
Why? Is the baby mine?

849
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,680
I will have you know that this show
is very important to a lot of people,

850
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,120
including but not limited to me.
My ass is on the line here.

851
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,280
Actually, your ass is irrelevant.

852
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,040
You're just a footnote. It's my ass,

853
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,880
my reputation, my integrity, mine!

854
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,640
"Mine!" You're such an egotistical,
selfish person!

855
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,760
I'm on-air talent!

856
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,360
Get in.

857
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,040
Hey!

858
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,720
OK, I'm home. You can leave.

859
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,120
Oh, no. No.

860
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,880
Wow.

861
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,200
Oh, my God.

862
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,480
- Is that a real...
- Good night

863
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,480
Of course.

864
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,720
Here we are
Just about the same

865
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,960
You're alone tonight?

866
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,760
Makes sense.

867
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,160
Let me guess.

868
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,800
You meet a guy.

869
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,520
You have about three dates.

870
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,520
Spend the whole time talking
about your job.

871
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,000
He loses your phone number.

872
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,960
Aside from your obvious father issues,

873
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,800
what'd he do?

874
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,960
Leave you? Die?

875
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,080
You've got this... repellent moxie.

876
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,480
Look at all the stories
you could be doing here.

877
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:57,280
About art and hunting and fishing.

878
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,160
I mean, you have grandchildren.

879
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,600
I didn't even know you had kids.

880
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,680
Look, we could be
doing parenting segments.

881
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,240
You should invite them down
to the show.

882
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,480
The ungrateful little bastards.

883
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,400
I don't think so.

884
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,760
Well, the little tour's over.

885
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,280
Time to go back to your sad little life.

886
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,680
I'm not going anywhere
until we are on the air.

887
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,160
Well, please don't snore.
I'm a light sleeper.

888
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,280
I'm not going to be sleeping.

889
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,640
Just about the same

890
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,360
Foggy little fella
Drowsy little dame

891
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,120
Two sleepy people
by dawn's early light

892
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,280
And too much in love
to say good night

893
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,480
Good night.

894
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,200
- Good night.
- Good night.

895
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,600
Let's go, girl.

896
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,080
- What are you doing?
- Have you ever seen a real egg?

897
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,320
These are from
pastured hens in Maryland.

898
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,840
- We have to go.
- I have them delivered once a week.

899
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,160
We have to go.

900
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,240
Now, the beauty of a frittata

901
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,920
is that it can be made
with any ingredient.

902
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,440
Anything that's in your refrigerator.

903
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,280
- Good. Get dressed.
- What? You want me to starve?

904
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,760
I've got to be in tip-top shape.

905
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,280
I'm going to appear on national
television in front of...

906
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,520
- What, six or eight people?
- Mike, come on.

907
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,280
Coffee?

908
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,360
What few people know
is that the frittata

909
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,520
was meant to be eaten
at room temperature.

910
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,720
- It was invented in Italy...
- Come on.

911
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,120
- ...for the afternoon repast.
- Look, guess what?

912
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,600
I don't really care
about your epicurean breakfast, OK?

913
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,520
I just need you to walk faster,
because we are going to be late.

914
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,240
Hey. Hello, there.

915
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,080
- Where the hell have you been?
- It's a long story.

916
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,960
She spent the night at my place.

917
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,040
Come on, everyone.
I slept on the couch.

918
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,800
Until I woke her up with my...
African rain stick.

919
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,440
All right. OK. It's Mike's first show,
so it's a really big day for us.

920
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,080
- Fire me today.
- Yeah, so let's go...

921
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,600
through the lineup from the top.

922
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,760
One more time.

923
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,880
We start with eight, full track.
We'll be cutting to nine with announce.

924
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,520
Nine will reveal the jib.
Jib, start a little wider.

925
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,800
OK. What are they promo-ing
on the Today show today?

926
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,920
- What aren't they promo-ing?
- What?

927
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,200
Crap. No.
Vieira scored that interview

928
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,720
with the drunk-driving
Playboy Playmate? What's on G.M.A.?

929
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,400
- Well, she's doin' Clooney. Yeah.
- Bitch.

930
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,080
Try not to bore the nation into a coma
with your dull news crap, OK?

931
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,200
Yes, certainly.

932
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,120
Oh, and... suck it.

933
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,520
Well, they look great together,
so that's promising.

934
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,400
Oh, heavenly ghost
of Edward R. Murrow.

935
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,640
OK, the Jewish guy is crossing himself,
so we're confident.

936
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,520
Thirty seconds to air.
Everybody ready?

937
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,760
They know about the cake?

938
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,240
Everybody does? Stage manager's
got that covered? Good.

939
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,760
- Cake is good to go. D-Day.
- I want the double matte through

940
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,600
both names, both names.
Great. OK, stand by...

941
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,280
Stand by, ticker.
Stand by, Deko, that's great.

942
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,160
- You ready for this?
- I'm ready. Are you ready?

943
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,400
Stand by, announce.
Ready to roll nine.

944
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,920
Here we go and roll nine.
Take nine.

945
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,560
- We're good so far.
- Stand by to go on four.

946
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,760
- And... here we go.
- ...on Daybreak.

947
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,200
- And go on four.
- Seven.

948
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,680
- Reveals four.
- There they are.

949
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,720
- Five.
- Four, three...

950
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,640
- ...and Mike Pomeroy.
- Go dissolve to Mike and cue them.

951
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,000
Good morning, everyone.

952
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,360
Before we begin, today is
a historic moment here on Daybreak.

953
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,280
Today's the day that Mike Pomeroy
Joins our little show.

954
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,840
We are so lucky to have a Journalist
of your caliber here with us, Mike.

955
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,600
We're Just... what can we say except,
welcome, welcome.

956
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,040
Yes.

957
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,280
- He said yes.
- That's it?

958
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,360
- Yes? He said yes.
- Yes. You got to be kidding me.

959
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,800
- That's great.
- That's all it is.

960
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,120
- Bring on the cake.
- We have a little surprise for you.

961
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,200
- Push in the cake.
- Happy First Day to you

962
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,280
- Happy First Day to you
- Ready three on Jane.

963
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,640
- Happy First...
- Thank you.

964
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,200
- Now on to today's top stories.
- Go, take it.

965
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,280
In Texas today, severe weather
continues to plague the Gulf Coast.

966
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,120
He's not buyin' it. Wow.

967
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,040
OK, all right, very good.
So far, he's a cozy blanket.

968
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,840
I need 22. Great.

969
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,640
...sexual offender is a Caucasian male
in his late thirties,

970
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,960
approximately six feet tall.
He apparently works alone,

971
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,320
gaining access to homes through
unlocked windows and doors.

972
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,160
- Stand by to change.
- Local police in Milwaukee

973
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,840
are asking anyone who recognizes this
sketch to contact them immediately.

974
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,440
- Change your graphic. And change it.
- In other news,

975
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,120
former President Jimmy Carter
continued his campaign

976
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,400
- for human rights in BeiJing this week.
- Hey!

977
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,840
- What?
- Guys, the...

978
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,440
- The graphic.
- Are you...?

979
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,200
- Change the graphic!
- See, the thing on the...

980
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,640
- ...on the graphic.
- Lose the graphic!

981
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,800
- Guys!
- Lose it!

982
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,360
Get the... the font on the graphic,
like the type on the...

983
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,280
- Please.
- China has been accused

984
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,680
- by detractors of backsliding...
- You just...

985
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,080
Yep, yep. Yep, yep, yep.

986
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,160
Stand by to change. Deko in.

987
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,400
We're going to weather.

988
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,880
For first look at weather,
here's Ernie Appleby.

989
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,520
Thanks, Colleen.

990
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,600
I'd like to take a moment to welcome
Mike Pomeroy to his first broadcast.

991
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:34,760
As one hurricane said to another,
I have my eye on you.

992
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,600
And lookin' across the country today,
you'll see we still have

993
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,760
that high-pressure system
comin' out of the Midwest.

994
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,440
We'll dissolve to tape.
Tape, stand by.

995
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,080
I want a center shot. Just keep...
Just center on one. Center on one.

996
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,040
That's perfect. Here we...
OK, great. Ready one. Ready two.

997
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,600
And go two.

998
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,440
Dissolve to Mike, and cue them.

999
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,400
And ticker in.

1000
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,480
Tomorrow on Daybreak, we'll show you
eight things you didn't know

1001
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,240
you could do with potatoes.
Should be fun.

1002
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,600
Also, we'll talk to some relief workers
who say the international community

1003
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,480
- has abrogated its duty to protect...
- What the hell is abrogated?

1004
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,480
That wasn't on the teleprompter.

1005
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,360
- Ready to widen on two.
- And that's our show for this morning.

1006
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,080
Welcome to the Daybreak family, Mike.

1007
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,120
- And thank you...
- Thank you, everyone. Goodbye.

1008
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,960
Goodbye.

1009
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,640
Goodbye.

1010
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,120
Goodbye.

1011
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,520
- Goodbye.
- How many is that?

1012
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,960
- Goodbye.
- Three each.

1013
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,760
- Bye.
- And we're out!

1014
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,400
- Fade to black. Here we go.
- Bye-bye.

1015
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,760
You know what you are?

1016
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,560
Excuse me for saying this,
but you're an asshole, OK?

1017
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,720
- Becky! What's her last name?
- You said you would banter!

1018
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,040
No, no, no, no.
You said I would banter.

1019
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,480
I said I would anchor a news show.

1020
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,520
That's what my contract calls for.
And that's what I'm going to do.

1021
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,600
But, Mike, you can't just go out there
and give monosyllabic answers

1022
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,120
- and talk about natural disasters!
- Are you sure?

1023
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,880
'Cause I think that's what I just did.
Anyway, what are you doing here?

1024
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,320
You have to get back to your office

1025
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,840
and wait for your phone call
from Jimmy Carter.

1026
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,120
- What?
- Jimmy Carter, "sexual offender."

1027
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,720
Now, go away, I'm busy.

1028
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,880
- But Mike, can you just promise...
- Go away.

1029
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,800
Go away. I just go away!

1030
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,040
Hey. It wasn't that bad.

1031
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,880
I don't wanna talk about it.

1032
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,240
OK.

1033
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,040
There's a plan.

1034
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,400
Sorry, just...

1035
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,080
Hey.

1036
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,760
I may need to see who that is.

1037
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,240
- OK. What if something happens?
- Then someone else

1038
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,600
will cover the world's biggest pumpkin.

1039
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,160
- That's not fair.
- No.

1040
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,320
No. Because you work for
a magazine show.

1041
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,280
- Yes.
- And you do one 15-minute story

1042
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,960
- every two months.
- That's right.

1043
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:26,400
And we are doing 15 stories a day,
none more than three minutes each,

1044
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,880
I mean, maybe three and a half,
if it's the President

1045
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,480
or they're nude photos or something...

1046
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,080
How reliable
is your alarm clock?

1047
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,120
...is making progress.
However, one good piece of news

1048
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,360
- is that the winds have come in...
- What's goin' on?

1049
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,800
Fire out west.
They're looking for an arsonist

1050
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,920
and they think that he might have
set the fire, like, three weeks ago?

1051
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,440
He could be a serial offender.

1052
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,320
- It's the middle of the night.
- I'm sorry.

1053
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,320
I have had such a lovely time.

1054
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,120
I really have and I...

1055
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,800
- I'm so glad that we...
- Go.

1056
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,200
- What?
- You want to go. You should go.

1057
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,520
Are you sure about that?

1058
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,400
Get out of here.

1059
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,000
Thank you.

1060
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,920
Good Morning America
got the mother of the arsonist.

1061
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:34,040
What? Ass!

1062
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,400
Don't. All right, I need
an arsonist spouse or something.

1063
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,240
- Damn it.
- So you're gettin'scooped

1064
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:46,160
like every morning. How come?
I mean, do you have any kind of plan?

1065
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,880
Yes, the show will still...
need some fine-tuning...

1066
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,160
Fine-tuning? Really?

1067
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,960
Can you tune something
when nothing is working?

1068
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,560
Mike Pomeroy is the key
to making this show work.

1069
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,200
Well, at the moment, he's ruining
your show, and to be honest,

1070
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,360
you haven't got much time
for fine-tuning, right?

1071
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,840
- Yeah. I'm not worried.
- You're... Really?

1072
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,440
I'm not worried.

1073
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,880
How about profiles?
We're doing a piece on Daniel Boulud.

1074
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,040
Does it end with me in
the kitchen making profiterole?

1075
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,240
No.

1076
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,920
Cornish hens.
OK, forget that.

1077
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,000
How about an interview
with Tim McGraw and Faith Hill?

1078
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:22,080
Either one of them becomes president
or cures cancer, let me know.

1079
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,440
But I do have one good lead.

1080
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,520
Yeah? Yeah, really?

1081
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,520
- I hear you're dating Señor Dipshit.
- What?

1082
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,760
- How did you make that happen?
- Who told you that?

1083
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,560
- Him and you, really?
- No, I'm...

1084
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,240
Because usually, you know, he dates
girls that are sort of, you know with...

1085
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,320
Taffy pullers with...
heavy meatballs?

1086
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,480
There's a developing story
coming out of Albany, though.

1087
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,840
The governor's
tax returns are being audited.

1088
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,120
Oh, for God's sakes,
you're killing me, no!

1089
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,840
- I want people to get to know you.
- No, you don't.

1090
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,760
You want me to pander so you can
sell erectile dysfunction medication.

1091
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,520
- Oh, no, I don't.
- Well, I won't!

1092
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,680
Oh, my God!
It's you, you're that guy!

1093
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,920
I just saw you this morning and
everyone was eating stuffed zucchini,

1094
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,720
and you were cranky about it. I was
like, "Oh, my God, there's that guy!"

1095
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,520
You used to do news, right?
Like a while ago? It's...

1096
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,240
Please, remove your hand
from my person. Thank you.

1097
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,760
This is great! Thank you!
I can't believe it! Dan Rather!

1098
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,520
- Dan Rather!
- See? People want to like you.

1099
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,000
You're...
you're in their home every day,

1100
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,320
and, you know,
it's an honor and, you know,

1101
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,440
why can't you just do stories
people might enjoy? Mike...

1102
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,040
We're in trouble. I'm in trouble.

1103
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,080
Help me, please.

1104
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,560
Dan Rather. For Christ's sake.

1105
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,000
Becky! Becky!

1106
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,880
Becky.

1107
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,440
I have a great idea for a segment.
Get ready for this.

1108
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,000
Past lives.
If we could find out who celebrities

1109
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,280
had been in their past lives, I think
that would be terrific, don't you?

1110
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:03,000
I mean, what if Justin Timberlake
had been Abraham Lincoln?

1111
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,800
Many actors have changed their names
to be taken more seriously.

1112
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,680
Ricky Schroder became Rick.

1113
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,240
The Rock became Dwayne Johnson.

1114
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,800
And Portia de Rossi's
name used to be Amanda,

1115
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,560
but she changed it so as to
sound more like the car,

1116
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,160
which she felt sounded
more impressorial.

1117
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,760
A new name has become the latest,
hottest accessory for celebrities,

1118
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,520
like a Birkin bag or a baby.

1119
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,200
Back to you, Mike or Michael.

1120
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,720
- Dissolve to Mike and ticker in.
- How did she get here?

1121
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:36,000
- Don't ask.
- What? Is she sleeping with someone?

1122
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,360
Pardon me?

1123
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,840
Thanks.

1124
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,040
- Have you seen these?
- Yes, but...

1125
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,560
You want to make the ratings worse?
That's why you came here?

1126
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:02,280
Well, no.
Mike is still getting up to speed.

1127
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,160
- I'm working on a couple elements.
- Gettin' Mike up to speed?

1128
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,440
- Yeah.
- You're circling the drain.

1129
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,080
You rarely book anybody decent
because of the ratings.

1130
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,480
- You're not gettin' any big interviews.
- We just need more time.

1131
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,880
- Just a little...
- God, you're, you're more naïve

1132
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,760
- than I thought, aren't ya?
- Excuse me?

1133
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,360
The network wants to cancel the show.

1134
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:28,000
They want to run game shows
and syndicated talk instead.

1135
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,360
For a second,
I thought you might have a shot,

1136
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,240
especially when you got Pomeroy.
But the joke's on me,

1137
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,960
'cause it turns out you failed even more
completely than the network thought.

1138
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,200
In six weeks, they cancel the show.

1139
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,840
Not only will you have significantly
weakened our news division,

1140
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,960
you will have presided over the
demise of a show that's been on the air

1141
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,040
for 47 years! Nice work.

1142
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,520
Why don't you go over to PBS and see
if you can kill Sesame Street.

1143
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,520
Go. You've wasted enough of my time.

1144
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,760
We have six weeks.
Can you just not tell anyone yet?

1145
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,000
Because morale isn't exactly at a peak.

1146
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,920
Fine. Tell 'em when you want to.
It doesn't really matter, does it?

1147
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,080
Piper, get Phil Griffin on the phone.

1148
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,800
Tell him if I don't hear
from him by 5:00,

1149
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,320
those Super Bowl tickets
go to Phyllis McGrady!

1150
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,600
...Joins us
now with details. Roger.

1151
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,840
It certainly is a happy day
here on Lincoln Road

1152
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,960
between Bedford Avenue
and Rogers Avenue.

1153
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,360
This is, yes, officials...

1154
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,640
- We're live at five, people.
- OK.

1155
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,200
Feathery, fleecy, flocculent?

1156
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,360
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- What? What's going on now?

1157
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,360
Mike is offended by a word
in the next story.

1158
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,400
He's offended.
It's about Easter chicks.

1159
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,200
I'm not saying the word "fluffy."

1160
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,720
It's bad enough I have to do
these ridiculous stories.

1161
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,760
You know what, buddy?
Guess what? Last week,

1162
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,720
I had to use the words "rectal"
and "moisture" in the same sentence.

1163
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:00,560
- Well, first dates can be awkward.
- Mike!

1164
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,720
- Becky...
- That's it!

1165
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,920
- Becky, Becky, what are you doin'?
- I've had enough!

1166
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,680
- Mike? I need to talk to you.
- Becky, we're back in 60.

1167
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,360
I'm sorry, this'll just take a second.

1168
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,560
I've looked up to you all my life.

1169
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,600
You know that? I actually idolized you.
My dad and I used to watch you on TV.

1170
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,960
So just, you know, imagine
my surprise when it turns out

1171
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:25,280
that you're actually the worst person
in the entire world.

1172
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:29,240
- Not the third worst! The worst!
- What's goin' on?

1173
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,920
Pomeroy.
He broke the latest Daybreak EP.

1174
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,920
...how lucky we all are
to have these Jobs,

1175
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,880
- how quickly that can be taken away.
- We're back in...

1176
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,920
And there's this guy, this really
kind of great, smokin' guy

1177
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,200
who can actually stand me
long enough to have sex with me.

1178
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,320
And you know what? It's all just
a big mess. Because of you!

1179
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,400
You know, nobody can do
their jobs well around here

1180
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,760
because you can't be bothered
to do yours at all!

1181
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:59,360
And we're back.

1182
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,600
Welcome back to Daybreak. And now,
with a check of the weather,

1183
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,800
- here's Ernie.
- Take Ernie on the plaza.

1184
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,760
Thanks, Colleen. Surprisingly toasty day
out here, isn't it, folks?

1185
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,720
Yeah!

1186
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,200
Good day to break out the bikini.
I know I'm wearing mine right now.

1187
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,160
All right. Well, what do we have here?

1188
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,240
Goodness, honey.
I did not put her up to this.

1189
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,280
- Coke? Diet Coke?
- No, I don't want a Diet Coke.

1190
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,640
Step aside!

1191
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,160
- Jerry, I would like to talk to you.
- You're gonna bust a cap in my ass?

1192
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:37,240
What if I get the ratings up?
We've got six weeks.

1193
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,240
What if I move that needle just enough?

1194
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:41,680
- You won't.
- We'll, you're... you don't know that.

1195
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,120
- Becky.
- There's got to be some number

1196
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,240
I can hit that will give us a shot, that
would give us an extra six months,

1197
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,600
- something.
- Sure, if you got over one point five

1198
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:52,080
- or something absurd like that...
- Done! So I've got your word?

1199
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,120
I get those ratings up more
than three quarters of a point,

1200
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,600
- you give me more time?
- It won't happen.

1201
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,600
We'll see about that.

1202
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,480
And your girlfriend Lisa?

1203
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,080
Can you get her a dictionary
and stick her on somebody else's show?

1204
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,120
'Cause she's killing me.

1205
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,520
Wow, well, look who the wind blew in!
What happened to you?

1206
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,120
Well, we're gonna change a few things.

1207
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,200
- OK.
- Is Ernie in place?

1208
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,560
Yes, he is. He'll be interviewing people
as they come off the coaster.

1209
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:26,680
No, he won't. Not anymore, he's not.
We're gonna put him on that coaster.

1210
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:30,480
We're gonna strap a handheld to the car
in front of him and then go live. Boom.

1211
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,560
It's called "picking up the game,"
people. OK? So from now on,

1212
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:37,240
every single story that we do,
it's gonna have to be sensational!

1213
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,640
We're gonna be more aggressive.
We're gonna work harder.

1214
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,920
And we're gonna do it right now.

1215
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,600
- Are, are you gonna...?
- I'm not gonna sing!

1216
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,160
Why do people ask me that?

1217
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,400
So the big question is,
are we gonna be able to hear his mic?

1218
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,480
Yes, we will.
If he has a heart attack,

1219
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,400
we'll be able to capture
every heartrending scream.

1220
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,480
- Really? Great.
- Cue her.

1221
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,840
Thrill-seekers have something to look
forward to this summer

1222
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,080
as Six Flags unveils
a brand-new roller coaster.

1223
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:08,320
The "Manhandler" is
the fastest coaster in the U.S.

1224
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,520
- with speeds up to 130 miles an hour...
- Stand Ernie by. Here we go.

1225
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:16,320
...ninety-five degrees. Our own
Ernie Appleby is getting a sneak peek

1226
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,920
at this amazing new ride,
isn't that right, Ernie?

1227
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,840
- Standing by. Open his mic.
- Ernie, can you hear us?

1228
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,880
Yes. Yes, I can. And so far,
it's a beautiful ride.

1229
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,360
Quite an amazing view from up here.

1230
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,160
Mostly blue skies.
Cumulus clouds on the horizon,

1231
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,760
always a good sign this time of year.

1232
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,280
Might be heading into our first dip.

1233
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,960
Oh, my. Oh, my.

1234
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,640
Oh, fu...

1235
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,560
No!

1236
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,160
Oh, yeah. No, this is a great idea.

1237
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,880
- Please, make it stop!
- Take two.

1238
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:16,440
What are you gonna do to him next?
Strap electrodes to his balls?

1239
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,320
I actually felt sorry for that
animatronic puppet asshole.

1240
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,440
Hey, look, we got 80,000 hits
on YouTube already.

1241
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,240
And Ernie is absolutely thrilled.
And by the way,

1242
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,880
we had another bump
in the minute-to-minutes.

1243
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,560
- Becky, good stuff.
- Thank you! Lighten up, Mike.

1244
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,360
You know what I've noticed?
People only say, "Lighten up"

1245
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,800
when they're gonna stick
their fist up your ass.

1246
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,600
Well, you know what?
I hate to break it to you,

1247
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,760
- but the fact is...
- Oh, my God, amazing segment.

1248
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,640
Thank you. The world has been debating
news versus entertainment for years

1249
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,840
and guess what?
Mike, your side lost.

1250
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:51,280
- You know what?
- What?

1251
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,760
You're wrong. People are smart.

1252
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:58,880
They want information. Not junk, which
is all you're willing to give them.

1253
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,040
- Junk. Sugar, sugar, sugar.
- Excuse me.

1254
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,880
- OK.
- And more sugar.

1255
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,560
Yeah, well, what would you
have them do, Mike?

1256
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:12,720
Eat bran all day?
Fiber, fiber, fiber?

1257
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,480
We have to get the ratings up, Mike,

1258
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:20,360
or we can have a lot of high-minded
ideas and not be on the air.

1259
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,640
This show may go down, but it's not
because I'm not trying my hardest.

1260
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,680
You hear me? I don't care what you do,
but I'm not giving up.

1261
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,800
I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk
to you right now about Ernie.

1262
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,080
I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk
to you right now about Ernie.

1263
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,640
- Oh, my God, you, too?
- Yes.

1264
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,560
Why is everyone worried about Ernie?
You know, he's a grown man.

1265
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,280
- Worried about Ernie? You kidding me?
- He signed release forms.

1266
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,400
He's a hack.
Look, I see what you're doing.

1267
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,040
I think it's great. It's exactly
what I've been waiting for,

1268
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,520
so just, you know, sign me up, coach.
Put me in.

1269
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,560
- Whatever you want to call it.
- Really?

1270
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,880
Yeah.

1271
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,920
Do you have any preexisting conditions?

1272
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,360
Are you kidding? Look at me.
I'm a rock.

1273
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,360
Would you like to hold him?

1274
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,320
I would love to hold it,
dear little thing.

1275
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,320
Watch it.
Careful he doesn't go in there.

1276
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,440
Can you get it out though?

1277
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,080
Mike wanted to be here for this.
Mike Pomeroy.

1278
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:23,200
You know how he is.
He loves animals.

1279
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,880
Have you just... You...
And then...

1280
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,960
Those are frog lips.
Does a frog open its lips ever?

1281
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,120
Ready four, take four.
Ready one. Take one.

1282
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,960
Ready one. Take it.

1283
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,760
- I would never do that.
- Kiss it.

1284
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,480
How about a big kiss, sucker?

1285
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,440
That's a little, that's wrong.

1286
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,560
That was so good. Do it again.

1287
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,760
Fitty, Fitty! Mr. Cent?
Hi! Fan.

1288
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,400
Big fan!
Take you to the candy shop

1289
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,320
- Whoa, let you lick
- I heard the song.

1290
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,240
I'm a producer for Daybreak and we
would so love to have you on our show.

1291
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,320
We'd give you twice as much time
as the Today show.

1292
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,240
And you could play four songs from
your new record. Just think about it.

1293
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,720
I'll take you to the candy shop

1294
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,640
I'll let you lick the lollypop

1295
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,200
- Oh!
- Go 'head girl, Don't you stop

1296
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,320
Yeah!

1297
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,320
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa!

1298
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,680
I'll take you to the candy shop

1299
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,520
Boy one taste of what I got

1300
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,640
I'll have you spending all you got...

1301
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,040
Ready one, take one! Ready two!

1302
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,480
Well!

1303
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,240
On the rabbi story, do you want
the transvestite prostitute

1304
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,680
- to be dressed as a man or a woman?
- A man.

1305
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,160
- Man.
- No, a woman.

1306
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:11,080
No, have him/her start
the segment as a woman and then,

1307
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,400
boom, after the break he/she
comes back as a man!

1308
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,000
- Yes. That's it.
- Yes. Yes.

1309
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,160
Back to you, Colleen.

1310
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,560
- All right! They've cut!
- Both. Emphatically.

1311
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,400
Here are the ratings.

1312
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,400
I know, I know.

1313
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,360
Yes, yes.

1314
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,840
And when we come back,
we'll tell you about

1315
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,960
new ways to cope with menopause.

1316
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,960
New doorknobs.

1317
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,240
OK.

1318
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,320
- And am I doing it right?
- Yes.

1319
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,760
How do you know?
You're not looking.

1320
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:02,520
Or we could do a whole series
on senior weight loss. A five-parter.

1321
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,520
We could get that health expert,
you know, the one with the...

1322
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,840
It's good, it's good, it's good.
I'll do it.

1323
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,400
Wait! Wait, look.

1324
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,880
The week-to-weeks are better and
total viewers are up by five percent!

1325
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,560
And those are not good enough!

1326
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,360
Turns out the burger patties were
contaminated with E. coli,

1327
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,000
which can cause cramping and diarrhea.

1328
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,760
- Lose the ticker, music in...
- We'll be right back on Daybreak.

1329
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,320
Dissolve the logo. And mark.

1330
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,000
And we're out.

1331
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,280
Great, a story about uncontrollable
shitting and look who gets it.

1332
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,400
Well, it's not my sort of thing.

1333
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,080
Can I just say one thing?
That's our job.

1334
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:51,680
I know you think you're above it
and, of course, you were above it

1335
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,960
before you got fired. But now,
guess what, you're down in the muck

1336
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,280
with the rest of us, Mike.

1337
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,560
And yet I still have standards,
unfortunately for you.

1338
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,080
- Suppose I don't have standards?
- Sure, you do.

1339
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,760
When you got your Pap smear on air,
you wore a silk robe.

1340
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,800
- OK!
- Classy touch.

1341
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,360
- We're back in five...
- That is it!

1342
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,480
I've had it with you!
I've had it!

1343
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,760
- Three... and two...
- Go, two.

1344
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,840
- ...one.
- Dissolve and cue.

1345
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,480
Tomorrow on the show, Colleen will
make the British classic bangers

1346
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:23,120
- and mash, with chef Gordon Ramsay.
- That's right, I will,

1347
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,840
because you refuse to do it, Mike.
Guess it's beneath you.

1348
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,040
Well, that and it's tough to get
between you and a sausage, so...

1349
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,280
Sausage, that's a good one.

1350
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,640
Yes, and also you are
a fatuous, pretentious idiot,

1351
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,680
- so there's that.
- A fatuous idiot who makes

1352
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,520
- three times what you make.
- That's our show for this morning.

1353
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,680
See you tomorrow, folks. Goodbye.

1354
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,360
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1355
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,640
- Goodbye.
- And goodbye.

1356
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:51,920
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1357
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,600
- Yeah, no, no, no.
- Bye.

1358
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,960
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Bye.

1359
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,040
This is yesterday,

1360
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,000
- after she insulted his tie.
- Right.

1361
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:04,080
After he asked her if she cries
ice cubes. Huge spike.

1362
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,960
They love it!

1363
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:10,280
We're so close. I mean, we need this.
We're, we're, we're almost there.

1364
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,960
Coming up in our next hour, we'll be
talking to people who successfully

1365
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,160
completed this innovative
rehab program.

1366
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,880
Might want to pick up
a few tips there, Mike.

1367
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:23,720
Do they have rehab programs for bitter
beauty queens with self-esteem issues?

1368
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,160
I wonder about that sometimes.

1369
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,560
Sometimes. Well, coming up next...

1370
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:34,240
But they are way better.
They're way up from last year.

1371
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:38,200
I'm, I'm almost there.

1372
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,160
So many people rely on this show.
They believe in it.

1373
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,480
You have until Friday.
That's the deal we made.

1374
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,000
And those are still not good enough.

1375
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:54,200
...so no real flooding to speak of in
the neighborhoods. But the concern is,

1376
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,840
they are prepared...

1377
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,240
- ...to help folks if necessary, Kitty.
- What?

1378
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,920
Well, the center of
lowa's second biggest city,

1379
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,040
Cedar Rapids, is already underwater.

1380
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,040
Sorry.

1381
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,840
I mean, our demos are getting better.

1382
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:16,520
But our overall numbers, they're
just not where they should be.

1383
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,400
We're just missing... something.

1384
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:25,160
Well, maybe it's time for another
eight-part series on the orgasm.

1385
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,640
Do you think so? I mean,

1386
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,920
I don't know what else we
would possibly talk about.

1387
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,160
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

1388
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,480
Never mind.

1389
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,400
Just... doesn't matter.

1390
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,480
I'll just deal with it in the morning.

1391
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:51,120
You look at me like there's something
wrong with me all the time.

1392
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,400
- And I can't, I can't do it.
- What?

1393
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,000
That is the most ridiculous
statement you have ever made.

1394
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,080
I can't let my guard down
for one second, you know.

1395
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:02,360
I don't look at my BlackBerry and I miss
getting the next big story.

1396
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:06,760
And I'm tired of feeling guilty
about my work. I can't.

1397
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,280
Becky, wait a second.

1398
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,720
Yeah. OK. Look, that
information's a matter of public record.

1399
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,360
I have a right to see it.
You know that.

1400
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,880
You want me to come on down there
and I'll bring a crew?

1401
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,640
Better yet, a subpoena.

1402
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,560
OK, and I think we
should end the segment

1403
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,960
with Ernie being tarred and feathered
in honor of the anniversary

1404
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,200
of the Boston Tea Party.

1405
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,160
Or I could do my good story
on weathervanes.

1406
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,680
No!

1407
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,520
OK, so great job, everyone.

1408
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:53,800
Excuse me, excuse me.
Just one, one moment, please.

1409
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,160
I have a story I'd like to do.

1410
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,640
Sauerkraut.

1411
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,640
Sauerkraut?

1412
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:16,320
Big annual Sauerkraut Festival upstate.

1413
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,640
They bowl with cabbage,

1414
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,320
make a big sauerkraut cake.

1415
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:27,040
They... have a competition
for the best sauerkraut.

1416
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,360
You want to do that?

1417
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,160
What? Do you have
a problem with that?

1418
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,080
No.

1419
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,560
It's OK? I'm doing the kraut? Right?

1420
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:44,600
- If you, if you want to.
- Good. Good.

1421
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:51,800
Hi!

1422
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,720
- Hi!
- Don't really have to go, you know.

1423
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,640
I want to. My goodness.
I wouldn't miss this for...

1424
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,360
- Get in.
- All right.

1425
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,400
Say hello to Joe.

1426
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,360
- Joe, Becky. Becky, Joe. Go.
- Hi, Joe.

1427
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:14,000
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
This isn't the way. No, no.

1428
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,440
- Mike, where are we going?
- To cover the news.

1429
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,280
- What?
- At 8am this morning,

1430
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,120
- I'm going to cover a story.
- Mike.

1431
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,720
- A real story.
- Are you kidding me?

1432
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,480
- Where are you?
- I don't know.

1433
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,680
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- Well, he won't tell me.

1434
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,520
He's kidnapped me.
He's gone around some kind of bend

1435
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,400
and I need you to get Colleen ready
with a backup story, please!

1436
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:38,520
- What backup story?
- Let Ernie do the weathervane thing.

1437
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,680
- No, no, no, no. Jesus.
- I need something

1438
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,600
when Mike's story tanks.

1439
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,440
You know, you're a terrible person!

1440
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,280
You baited me with sauerkraut.
That's so low.

1441
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,600
I mean, what the hell
is this story, Mike?!

1442
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,160
- The governor.
- What governor?

1443
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,840
We're not even
anywhere near Albany.

1444
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,320
No, we're not.
It's up here a little further, Joe.

1445
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,360
- A little further.
- Oh, my God,

1446
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,800
this is the governor's country house.
Are you out of your mind?

1447
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,440
You're experiencing a psychotic break.
Are you insane?

1448
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,840
Well, I won't be dragged down with you.
You're gonna get us arrested and fired.

1449
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I get fired, I never work again,
you lunatic.

1450
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,440
I'm not gonna run it, Mike.
I won't, you can't make me.

1451
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,040
I'll run Colleen getting her bikini
line waxed before I run it. Mike!

1452
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,080
They're gonna cancel the show!

1453
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,160
If we don't get our numbers up
by the end of this week, we're toast.

1454
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:37,160
We're gonna be replaced
by soap operas and... game shows.

1455
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,400
Come on, Joe.

1456
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,720
- Lenny, are you ready?
- Ready?

1457
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,240
- Ready? Ready for what?
- Jesus.

1458
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,600
- Check, check.
- Hey.

1459
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,680
You'll know when to go live.
Get out of my shot.

1460
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,800
Go live with what?

1461
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,680
Pomeroy!

1462
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,240
- Gary, how are ya?
- What the hell are you doin'here?

1463
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,840
I need the weathervanes, Lenny.

1464
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,200
- I need 'em, need...
- So we're goin' with weathervanes.

1465
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,320
- Yes.
- Specifically,

1466
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,920
we'd like to know how you feel about
the Attorney General's filing

1467
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,280
racketeering charges
against you this morning.

1468
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,560
- Charges of corruption...
- No, wait, wait.

1469
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:21,560
- ...and steering government contracts.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1470
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,080
- We cannot wait!
- Hold your horses.

1471
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:27,920
And there's a hooker or two...
in there as well, isn't there, sir?

1472
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,440
- Oh, my God.
- Becky!

1473
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,160
- What is going on here?
- Comin' through!

1474
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,960
Mike, I don't know where you get
your information. You know I like you.

1475
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,800
- Stand by to go live.
- What?

1476
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,600
...but if you don't leave,
I'm gonna have to call the police.

1477
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,600
- Wait one second.
- I don't think that's gonna

1478
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,280
be necessary, sir.

1479
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,840
Becky!

1480
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,960
Live! Live!

1481
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,200
Live to Becky, now!

1482
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,920
- Up on rem two!
- Now taking you live

1483
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,960
to Mike Pomeroy for a special report.

1484
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:02,080
Federal authorities have been
planning this raid for weeks.

1485
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:06,080
This reporter has learned that
the indictment contains 15 counts

1486
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:09,800
of racketeering
and using undue influence.

1487
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,960
My sources tell me authorities
have tapped phone calls,

1488
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:16,320
and incriminating e-mails.

1489
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,320
Mike Pomeroy, Daybreak.

1490
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,880
Back to you in the studio.

1491
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,080
- Take two.
- Thanks, Mike.

1492
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:30,480
Partly cloudy skies this afternoon
with slight chance...

1493
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:33,640
You know, you could have told me.
I might have covered it anyway.

1494
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:34,800
Liar.

1495
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,680
Look, I get it.

1496
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,400
Nobody really cares that
I can do this job, but...

1497
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,760
But I can.

1498
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,560
I wanted you to see that.

1499
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,440
That was a great story, Mike.

1500
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,880
That was...
that was better than a great story,

1501
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,440
that was great television.
I mean, that was bran with a doughnut.

1502
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,440
A bran doughnut.

1503
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,640
I've got a grandkid.

1504
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,600
Did you know that?

1505
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,440
Alexander.

1506
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:22,920
I haven't seen him since I got fired.

1507
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,920
I was embarrassed...
after all I'd accomplished.

1508
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:30,080
And then to...

1509
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:35,640
...come back to the news... this way.

1510
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,200
The truth is, I'd...

1511
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,160
I'd screwed up with my kids

1512
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,360
way before I got canned.

1513
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:51,640
Anyway, I was never at home and...

1514
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:55,400
...when I was,
I took every phone call,

1515
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:58,440
watching TV out of the corner of my eye.

1516
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:05,520
Why am I telling you this?
You're worse than I am.

1517
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,600
You'd sleep at the office if you could.

1518
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,000
Let me tell you how it turns out.

1519
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,480
You end up with... with nothing.

1520
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,040
Nothing.

1521
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:30,360
Which is... which is what I had...

1522
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,320
...till you came along.

1523
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,880
Wait a second.

1524
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,800
Did you just say something nice to me?

1525
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,840
I told you I could banter.

1526
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:55,080
Felt like getting a jump on it.

1527
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:27,600
They're not... awful.

1528
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,360
How much longer can we get?

1529
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:33,600
Well, I have to check
with upstairs, but...

1530
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:38,880
with these I can get you a year,
a comfortable year.

1531
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,640
I underestimated you, Becky.

1532
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,880
That's... that's very, very true.

1533
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,440
NBC called.

1534
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,200
NBC?

1535
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:53,880
Wanted to know how much time
you have on your contract.

1536
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,320
The Today show wants you.

1537
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,240
Well, that's very flattering. I...

1538
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,760
Is that what you want?

1539
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,240
They were gonna cancel the show.

1540
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,760
- OK.
- Yeah.

1541
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:53,960
And somehow, we saved it.

1542
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:57,360
And, you know, the thing is...
is that the second I knew

1543
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:02,240
that everything was gonna be OK, the
person that I wanted to tell was you.

1544
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,840
The Today show? That's huge.

1545
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:11,520
Yeah, yeah,
it's, it's, it's incredible.

1546
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:15,080
But I, I have to think about it. I...

1547
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,640
- What?
- Well, yeah, I mean, I...

1548
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,880
Well, the thing is, is that at Daybreak,
everyone's really starting to click.

1549
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,400
Everybody's pitching in
and doing what they're best at.

1550
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,160
- No story too high or low.
- No, hold on,

1551
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:29,560
you can't say no to this.
When you get an opportunity like this,

1552
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:32,640
- you have to grab it.
- Even Mike is almost happy.

1553
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,960
And that's a good enough reason to
give up the best job in broadcasting?

1554
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,880
We're...

1555
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,640
Daybreak is a family now.

1556
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,920
Becky, I've known Mike a long time.

1557
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,080
I... It doesn't matter how happy he is.

1558
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:52,160
He's not just gonna suddenly
change into a different person.

1559
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:54,920
Well, I think you're wrong.

1560
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,560
I know what I'm doing with him now.

1561
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:01,160
I do. I do.

1562
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,200
It's gonna be great.

1563
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:09,040
So we've got the Supreme Court
Justice hearings at the top of the hour

1564
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,680
and then... I forgot
to tell you, Anthony Bourdain

1565
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,280
- wants to do a segment with you!
- Bourdain? Love him. Not doin' that.

1566
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,680
But say hi to Tony.
I owe him a bottle of Patron.

1567
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,960
- What...?
- What? We do one good story together

1568
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:28,120
and suddenly I'm your bitch?
Don't think so. Sorry.

1569
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:32,800
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
You can't do one story for me?

1570
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,640
Oh, my God, what is wrong with me?

1571
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,120
What am I doing here,
beating my head against this wall?

1572
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,760
I might as well go to the Today
show where you don't have to poke

1573
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,160
- Matt Lauer with a stick...
- The Today show?

1574
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:44,400
- Yes, they offered me a job.
- Of course.

1575
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:47,040
- But you know what? I said...
- Time to move on.

1576
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,480
You'll love the Today show.

1577
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,760
You and Vieira can do
menopause stories every week!

1578
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,720
You know what's really ridiculous?
Is that until about ten seconds ago,

1579
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:59,240
I'd actually considered turning my back
on the best job I've ever been offered.

1580
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,240
Isn't that totally absurd?

1581
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,920
What's keeping you?

1582
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,760
OK.

1583
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,240
You know, if you'd ever treated me
with some kind of friendship or loyalty,

1584
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:15,880
or trust, these things
that you seem incapable of...

1585
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:20,320
You miserable, lonely, egotistical,
selfish asshole!

1586
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,600
- Hey, Becky.
- Hi.

1587
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,880
They called again. Today show.

1588
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,800
Thanks.

1589
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,600
Becky Fuller.

1590
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:58,080
Obviously, we have a long
track record of success here

1591
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:02,600
at the Today show, but we're
always looking to stay current,

1592
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:06,520
to get out of our comfort zone,
and we want the show

1593
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:10,360
to have that youthful energy.
And we are so impressed

1594
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,800
with what you have done
with Daybreak.

1595
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,840
Well, thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

1596
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:19,960
Everyone is talking about it.
You must know that.

1597
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:23,280
I mean, you have done an amazing job
of revitalizing a show

1598
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:26,200
that many people
had just completely written off.

1599
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:28,560
Well, thank you. Thanks.

1600
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:30,320
And we're out!

1601
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:34,120
You did this.

1602
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,960
They're gonna hire her.

1603
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:39,280
Yeah. She's at the Today show
right now, ding dong.

1604
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:43,520
Do you have any idea, you know,
what you've done here?

1605
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:47,960
Because we had a decent producer,
a decent show and,

1606
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,000
God forbid, anyone around here
should be happy,

1607
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:53,480
but you had to have this happen,
didn't you?

1608
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,760
All right, stand by, folks. Here we go.

1609
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,960
Three, two, one.

1610
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:01,040
And dissolve two.
And cue 'em! Cue 'em!

1611
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:04,200
- Welcome back to Daybreak.
- What is wrong?

1612
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,920
...at the nation's
crumbling infrastructure.

1613
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,400
Go to Colleen.
Jesus, jump off Mike.

1614
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,040
- Where the hell is he going?
- Take three, three.

1615
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:13,800
Cue over to three. Swing her to three,
please. Come on, Jane, over to three.

1616
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,640
Sorry, the... this segment's
usually a two shot

1617
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:19,680
of Mike and Colleen
and Mike's not there.

1618
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:24,120
They've probably just
changed something. Sorry.

1619
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,160
I don't know. Where is Mike?

1620
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,680
- I need eggs.
- You need what?

1621
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:33,240
You know, from chickens. Eggs!

1622
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:38,040
Really don't enjoy this job.

1623
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:41,240
Chinese people, move, move, move!

1624
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,440
Thank you!

1625
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:48,200
Celery. Peppers. Cheese. Cheese.

1626
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,880
Yeah, thank you very much.

1627
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,320
We wanted to know what your plans
are for sports coverage.

1628
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,360
Sports. Great, OK.
Great.

1629
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,240
I love sports.

1630
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,320
Come on, move, move!
Let's go, let's go!

1631
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:09,000
- Get it in there, slide it in!
- Mike, tell us what you need.

1632
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:14,160
I need a cutting board, good knife,
nice plate, bowl, whisk.

1633
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,880
What is this, rubber?
Get me a real bowl.

1634
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,640
- Where are my eggs?!
- Cue over to three.

1635
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:21,720
- Where are my goddamn eggs?!
- Eggs for Mike, please!

1636
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:25,080
In respect to sports, I think that it's
really important to reach out

1637
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,880
to women through their kids
because it's not that big of a step

1638
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,520
to go from being a soccer mom
to, you know, a...

1639
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,240
Oh, my God. What is he doing?

1640
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,760
Sorry, I just...

1641
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:44,040
This is... Mike Pomeroy is having
a nervous breakdown on air.

1642
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:45,480
That's kind of big news.

1643
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:48,000
...a meal for their afternoon repast,

1644
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:51,640
something they could make
using whatever ingredients

1645
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,680
- they had available.
- Holy shit.

1646
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:59,640
I've been making frittata
for about 20 years now,

1647
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,720
ever since I was taught how to,

1648
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:05,960
on a naked weekend
with a beautiful Italian movie star,

1649
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,400
who shall, of course,
remain nameless.

1650
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,760
Occasionally, I make them at home.

1651
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:16,840
But only for people that I...

1652
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,560
People I really care about.

1653
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,840
Now the key to a great frittata

1654
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:26,320
is a very hot pan,

1655
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,280
because that, my friends,

1656
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:34,480
is what makes it... fluffy.

1657
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,880
We'll let this firm up a little bit.

1658
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,400
- Dash of pepper.
- I'm sorry. I...

1659
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:48,840
You watchin' this?

1660
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:55,880
- Becky?
- Yes, I... yeah.

1661
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,920
He is not gonna ask you twice.

1662
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,080
We'll give it a few seconds,
then we'll pop it in the hot oven.

1663
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,080
Bye! Thanks!

1664
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:14,160
A little pepper.

1665
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,520
Stand by. He's goin' back to the oven.
Ready three.

1666
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:39,680
A lot of people like a glass of di Gavi.

1667
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,800
Gavi di Gavi, perhaps.

1668
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:45,400
I, myself, like a... Barolo.

1669
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:56,360
I'll just free up the edges.

1670
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:23,200
Next week on the show,
I'll show you how to make

1671
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,920
a fantastic beignet,

1672
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,240
which the rabble like to call...

1673
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,480
...doughnuts.

1674
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:38,760
The old bastard.

1675
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:45,120
You know, he's still the
third worst person in the world.

1676
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,360
Yeah, I know.

1677
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,600
That's good.

1678
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,960
That's really good.

1679
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,040
I want a tropical fruit plate.

1680
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:07,880
"His gravity leavens
the silliness of morning TV,

1681
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:12,240
making for an incongruous
but somehow perfect match.

1682
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,880
Turns out that after 40 years
in the business,

1683
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:18,200
the real Mike Pomeroy
has finally arrived."

1684
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:19,440
Not bad.

1685
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:22,680
By the way, I'm getting
my prostate checked next week.

1686
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:24,840
I thought I'd take a crew with me.

1687
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,680
- That's a great idea. We...
- Jesus, I'm kidding.

1688
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:31,120
No, seriously, they have these
little teeny, tiny cameras

1689
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:33,040
- that go right up your...
- No, no, no.

1690
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:35,160
What if we got you
a body double?

1691
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,560
- No!
- No?

1692
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:40,800
Not in a thousand years.

1693
01:42:41,180 --> 01:43:08,800
