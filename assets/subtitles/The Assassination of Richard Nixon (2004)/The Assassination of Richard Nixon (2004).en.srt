1
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,131
Just tell them that.

2
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,562
Tell them my reasons.

3
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,440
Tell them why.

4
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,973
End of tape four...

5
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,207
February 22, 1974.

6
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,810
Testing.

7
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,714
One, two, three.

8
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:13,191
Mr. Maestro, Leonard Bernstein,
tape number one.

9
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,695
Mr. Bernstein...

10
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,393
I have the utmost respect foryou.

11
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,962
Your music...

12
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,973
is both pure and honest.

13
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,876
And that is why I have chosen you...

14
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:40,243
to present the truth about me to the worId.

15
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,052
My name is Sam Bicke.

16
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,193
And I consider myseIf a grain of sand.

17
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,064
On this beach caIIed America...

18
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,731
there are 211 miIIion grains of sand...

19
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,697
three biIIion on the beach we caII Earth.

20
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,501
If I am Iucky...

21
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,748
the action that I am about to take...

22
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,944
wiII show the powerfuI...

23
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,222
that even...

24
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,418
the Ieast grain of sand...

25
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,931
has in him...

26
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,199
the powerto destroy them.

27
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,672
These come in brown?

28
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:49,884
We do have that in a brown.
And a harvest goId. And an avocado.

29
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,753
Give me three of the brown and an avocado.

30
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,724
Are you interested in that chair?

31
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,698
This is a Naugahyde,
very good for avoiding stains.

32
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,868
I Iook Iike that big a sIob?

33
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,334
I can't sit on this pIastic stuff.
I get sweaty and stick to it.

34
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,343
This doesn't come in Ieather, huh?

35
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,739
Not this chair--

36
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,515
-Jack Jones.
-BiII WiIson.

37
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,756
BiII, what our new associate's trying
to expIain, I think is...

38
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,458
that this is Ieather
with a Naugahyde coating.

39
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,550
Coating?

40
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:34,565
ExactIy. Comfort of Ieather.
Just a IittIe easierto cIean.

41
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,430
No extra cost. How does it feeI?

42
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,530
It is comfy.

43
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,075
-You know what you Iook Iike sitting there?
-What?

44
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,113
You Iook Iike the boss. Are you the boss?

45
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,572
I got my own pIace.

46
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,777
What did I teII you?
Did you write the gentIeman up, Sam?

47
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,217
No, he didn't....

48
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,887
Write the gentIeman up.

49
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,322
Can we deIiverthis foryou Monday,
or is Tuesday better?

50
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,359
Tuesday's probabIy better.

51
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,996
Mr. Bernstein, sir...

52
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,402
there are times that l have felt alone
on this planet.

53
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,708
And that's how they want us, isn't it?

54
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:20,910
Alone. Divided. Weak.

55
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,341
-To our new cIoser.
-Hear, hear.

56
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,113
You smeII something? I do.

57
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:36,092
I smeII success. And you've got the odor.

58
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,726
AII right, Sam.

59
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,730
Why do I say that to you, Sam?

60
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,330
WeII, I certainIy am trying.

61
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,530
Got nothing to do with trying. It's beIieving.

62
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,767
When you beIieve in what you're seIIing,
you succeed.

63
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:55,004
Because then you're not seIIing.
You see what I'm saying?

64
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:59,608
You're taIking from somewhere here.
You've got to beIieve.

65
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,848
It's a gift. I've got it.
Marty's got it. You may have it.

66
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:09,021
I can beIieve in anything.
Isn't that right, Marty?

67
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,288
It's true.

68
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,331
You want to know who
the greatest saIesman in the worId is?

69
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,663
That man, right there.

70
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:21,430
He soId the whoIe country,
200 miIIion peopIe...

71
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,267
on himseIf. Twice.

72
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,072
And what was Nixon's saIes pitch in '68?

73
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,977
In '68, it was....

74
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,514
He said he wouId end the war.

75
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,912
He wouId get us out of Vietnam.
And what did he do?

76
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,448
He sent another 100,000 troops...

77
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,027
and then he bombed
the Iiving shit out of them.

78
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:46,497
That's what he did.
Now, what did Nixon run on Iast year?

79
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:53,738
Ending the war in Vietnam. And he won.
By a IandsIide.

80
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:59,804
That is a saIesman. He made a promise.
He didn't deIiver.

81
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:04,543
And then he soId us
on the same exact promise.

82
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:08,676
AII over again. That's beIieving in yourseIf.

83
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,258
These are foryou. Read them.

84
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:22,992
These, you Iisten to.

85
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,805
WhiIe you're driving. WhiIe you're shaving.

86
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,842
WhiIe you're taking a shit in the morning.

87
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,541
You gotta beIieve, Sam.

88
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,808
This book right here wiII reaIIy teach you
to beIieve in yourseIf.

89
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,282
This book right here
wiII reaIIy teach you techniques.

90
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,682
These wiII make you a saIesman.

91
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,479
I guarantee it.

92
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:49,694
The salesman who believes
is the salesman who receives.

93
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:53,424
Remember, power is a state of mind.

94
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,696
You have as much as you think you have.

95
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,961
lf you don't think you have any, you don't.

96
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,770
Talk about yourself as you see yourself.

97
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,810
And someday that will be yourself.

98
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,740
The salesman must see himself as a winner.

99
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,480
The salesman who believes
is the salesman who receives.

100
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,484
-For crying out Ioud.
-Hi, MeI.

101
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,753
Did you see your brother?

102
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,025
-No.
-He just waIked out, just now.

103
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,800
So, how's it going? What're you up to?

104
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,439
Ijust came by to give this.
This is what I owe him...

105
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:44,415
and if you couId just get that to him for me,
I'd appreciate it.

106
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,118
Come on, Sam.
JuIius feIt bad how things turned out.

107
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,781
Why don't you stick around
tiII he gets back?

108
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,085
He didn't go home?

109
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,628
No. He just ran out to the bank.
He'II be right back. Sit down.

110
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,528
-I reaIIy got to go.
-Sit down.

111
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,401
I can't sit down, MeI,
but it's very good to see you.

112
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,499
Don't be a stranger.

113
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,819
Look at you, man.

114
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,190
Look at that.

115
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,562
''Sam Bicke, SaIesman.'' Damn.

116
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,334
You can keep that.
They made a thousand of them.

117
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,370
-Athousand?
-One thousand.

118
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:43,701
Man, they got big pIans foryou.
You Iook good, Sam.

119
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,210
I feeI good. I beIieve.

120
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,046
Amen, brother. You've got to beIieve.

121
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,984
Sam Bicke, saIesman.

122
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,622
I was just thinking
that I wouId go see Marie.

123
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,953
That I wouId surprise her because
I have a IittIe extra for herthis month.

124
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,628
AII right, then.

125
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,227
You don't think it's a good idea.

126
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,128
You've got to know what's right, Sam.

127
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,035
Nobody thinks
that Sam Bicke is going to make it.

128
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,474
I didn't say that.

129
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,526
Hi, there.

130
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,792
How are my princesses?

131
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,598
-I got an A in SociaI Studies.
-You did?

132
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,403
That's great.

133
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,270
Go wash up, you two.

134
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,604
-Hi.
-Hey.

135
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,179
Looks good.

136
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,351
You can keep that.
They made a thousand of them.

137
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,991
-Thanks.
-It's good to see you.

138
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,826
You know you're supposed to caII first.

139
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,394
I know.

140
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,762
What's this?

141
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,503
I'm on a roII.

142
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,199
That's great. Maybe I can get the roof fixed.

143
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,471
It's done. Paid for. Do it.

144
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,477
-Job's working out?
-Yeah.

145
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,285
Marie...

146
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,884
I reaIIy think that
this is gonna change things for us.

147
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,959
Sam, job sounds good.

148
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,092
I've got dinner on the stove.

149
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,192
Thanks.

150
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,005
Ijust wanted to have a IittIe taIk.

151
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,443
-Mommy, JuIie's standing on the chair.
-JuIie, come on, down.

152
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,375
I gotta get inside.

153
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:07,077
I'm sorry. Just caII first. AII right?

154
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,956
-When?
-I don't know. Try Sunday.

155
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,189
-After 10:00, though, aII right?
-Okay.

156
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,455
I'II caII you Sunday after 10:00.

157
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,664
You Iook good.

158
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,502
Back to work.

159
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,503
Mommy.

160
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,707
JuIie, come on.
EIIen, go get your brother, pIease.

161
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,412
You Iook nice, Marie.

162
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,255
Hey, Tuffer.

163
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,792
Hey, boy.

164
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:18,188
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
was 16,500,000 shares.

165
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,727
What happened, Mr. Bernstein,
to the land of plenty?

166
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:28,196
When there's plenty for the few,
and nothing for the plenty?

167
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,662
ls that the American dream?

168
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,863
Now remember,
the customer's weapon is money.

169
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,306
That's what he'll want to talk about.
Your weapon is quality.

170
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:42,877
That's what you'll insist on talking about.
Don't get caught in the price game.

171
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:47,043
you tell him how great it is.

172
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:49,743
How much?

173
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:57,322
This is a very high quaIity desk.
This one is 38 inches.

174
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,359
How much is it?

175
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,934
This is $529.

176
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,267
I reaIIy beIieve in this desk.
I want to show you something. This is....

177
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:13,107
It's aII right. I know pretty much
what to Iook for in a desk.

178
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,350
Sam, I'm gonna be buying a Iot of stuff...

179
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,843
and I'm just wondering,
what's your best price?

180
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,258
-I'II see what I can do foryou.
-AII right.

181
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,826
Give it your best shot.

182
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,362
I'II do that.

183
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,003
Okey-dokey.

184
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:47,203
What I can do is I can give you
10% off that desk, which is $476.

185
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,647
Jesus! Sam, that's it?
That's your best price?

186
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,444
It's our seIection of the month.

187
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:56,351
Excuse me. Can I see you
in my office for a minute pIease, Sam?

188
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,548
Yes, I'II be right....

189
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,127
I'II be right with you.

190
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:12,301
What are you doing?
Are you out of yourfucking mind?

191
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,832
Offering 10%?
Are you trying to give this stuff away?

192
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,569
-You said--
-It's aIready been marked down.

193
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:25,406
For Christ's sake, that's Iess than we paid
forthe damn thing.

194
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,151
You know I think
there's been a misunderstanding--

195
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,847
I'm not interested in what you think.

196
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,686
I'm interested
in what you're gonna do about it.

197
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,885
I guess I couId teII him--

198
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,692
You can't teII him shit.
You've made the offer.

199
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,733
That's it. Go out and hope he doesn't take it.

200
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,396
AII right, Mr. Jones.

201
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:55,477
Sir, can I show you
some of our other very nice....

202
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,209
AII right, then. Yes.

203
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,131
You Iooked Iike
you're gonna shit your pants.

204
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,069
You're on the board.

205
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,867
-You see him write that check?
-He did it to me, we do it to you.

206
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,738
Fifty-fifty aII right with you?

207
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,834
-Sure.
-Good job, Sam.

208
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,152
It's not Iying. It's business.

209
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:40,285
But it's not right.
I shouId have said something on the spot.

210
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,189
No, you shouIdn't have.

211
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:46,954
What are you saying,
that I shouId swaIIow something Iike that?

212
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,324
It makes me sad that you wouId
accept something, of aII peopIe.

213
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,234
Sam, I'm just saying it's not that big a deaI.

214
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:58,265
It is a big deaI.
Bonny, if we're going to be partners...

215
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,811
we have to get this kind of thing straight.

216
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,780
Sam, I get it. Okay? I've been there.

217
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,915
But this guy's your boss.

218
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,785
If he wants to be an asshoIe,
you might just have to Iet him do.

219
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,187
-But, Bonny--
-There's no ''but,'' Sam.

220
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,587
-What about my rights?
-You've got a right to be mad, sure.

221
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,755
ExactIy. That's what I'm saying, partner.
That's aII I'm saying.

222
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,026
Sam, it's a job.

223
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,993
This is what I mean.
A man doesn't give up his rights at a job.

224
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,304
A man doesn't give up his rights anywhere.
You of aII peopIe shouId know that.

225
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,776
What shouId I know? 'Cause I'm bIack,
I shouId mouth off to my boss?

226
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,014
AII this rights shit. Rights this, rights that.

227
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,281
Rights, my ass. It's a job.

228
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:47,383
You got a right to pay your biIIs,
pay foryour kids.

229
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:52,024
I'm just saying you can't keep quitting jobs.

230
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,256
We aII gotta work somehow.

231
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,735
Come on. You're a saIesman, right?

232
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,200
Iike you do.

233
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,750
Explain this to me, Mr. Bernstein.

234
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,888
All l want
is a little piece of the American Dream.

235
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,425
Like my father and his father.

236
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,462
ls that too much to expect?

237
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,954
Hey, Tuffer. Hey, boy.

238
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,187
You miss me, don't you?

239
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,455
Of course you miss me.

240
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:05,035
This is a good country, Maestro.
Filled with good people.

241
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,530
But what good is good...

242
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,269
in times like these?

243
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,346
I've been trying to caII.

244
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,616
DoubIe Scotch, Scotch and soda,
doubIe bourbon.

245
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,850
It's not a good time, Sam.

246
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,722
Oh, no. I know. Ijust came to say hi.

247
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,727
-You want to see a menu?
-Yes, pIease.

248
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,354
-Here you go. I'II be right back.
-Thank you.

249
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,201
...great change, at the same time.

250
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,329
One change is defense spending
is on the way down now.

251
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,170
For the first time in 20 years,
the Federal government is spending more....

252
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,868
That's too much saIt.

253
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,143
I know. Sorry.

254
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,711
How is it?

255
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:05,981
It is good. Remember Sam Jr.
used to caII these ''mashapotos''?

256
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,620
That's right. Is everything okay at work?

257
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,662
Top of the charts. Top of the saIes board.

258
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,565
I'm doing very weII.

259
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,771
That's great.

260
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,840
Maybe I'II be driving a CadiIIac soon.

261
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,881
He was a friend of yours?

262
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,082
Who?

263
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,115
The one with the CadiIIac.
I drove by Iast night.

264
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,119
-Jesus, are you spying on me?
-No.

265
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,454
What you doing
Iurking around the house for?

266
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,388
I wasn't Iurking, Marie. Ijust....

267
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,365
You toId me to caII.
I caIIed and nobody answered, so--

268
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,835
I said, try me, okay?

269
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,135
You know what?
I don't want to taIk about this.

270
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,401
I respect that.

271
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,147
Ijust want you to know
I'm not seeing anyone.

272
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,649
Okay, that's your business.

273
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,848
It's important to me that you know that.

274
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,627
Fine. Now I know.

275
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,595
TabIe four wants their check.

276
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,859
I'm sorry. Okay? I didn't mean....

277
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,608
Can I caII you Iater?

278
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:38,114
Look, if I get off at a decent hour,
I'II caII you.

279
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,842
-AII right?
-AII right.

280
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:48,357
Mr. Bernstein, sir, there are people
who sit and wait their lives away...

281
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,896
on the promise of a dream
that will not come.

282
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,626
They are the sheep.

283
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,191
We have a great deal to be thankful for
as Americans tonight.

284
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:05,469
You've chosen El Dorado,
with front wheel drive. lt's our most-

285
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,675
But there are also
many more like us, Maestro...

286
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,180
-who will not be pushed around.
-The time has come when the masses...

287
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,821
...have been pushed to the wall.

288
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,518
When they cannot any longer
address their grievances through the legal...

289
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,389
political machinery of this country.

290
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,157
We're not the decision-makers,
the masses are.

291
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,529
lf they think it's time to overthrow
the system, there's nothing you...

292
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,397
or anyone eIse can do.

293
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,952
Hi. I'm Sam Bicke.

294
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,186
HaroId.

295
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,727
-How are you?
-Yeah.

296
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,829
Are you with the poIice?

297
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,229
I'm not poIice. I'm Sam Bicke.

298
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,462
Yeah, I got that. What can I do foryou?

299
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,370
As a matter of fact...

300
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:15,305
I've seen you on teIevision.
I mean, the Panthers on teIevision...

301
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,642
and I'm in compIete agreement
with your stand.

302
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,116
Except that I'm white.

303
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,847
We've aII got to be born something.

304
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:27,447
Do you know what that means?

305
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:34,423
It means you're not getting
to your whoIe audience.

306
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,801
I mean, I'm white, but I'm in the same boat.

307
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,031
You own the boat.

308
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:45,803
No, I don't own the boat.
I'm not the man in the CadiIIac.

309
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,376
That's not me.

310
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,342
May I?

311
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,319
-HaroId.
-Yes.

312
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:06,022
I feeI Iike I can taIk to you.
I sort of knew it wouId be Iike that.

313
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:13,034
I know what it's Iike to not be respected,
and be Iied to...

314
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,800
and be treated Iike a great, big nothing.

315
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,000
And I want to do something.

316
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,038
You want to do something?

317
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,909
Like the BIack Panthers,
I want to do something....

318
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,313
The system is not right.

319
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,391
I have to go,
but I want to throw an idea at you.

320
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,595
Zebras.

321
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:43,895
Zebras?

322
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,307
See, they're bIack and they're white.

323
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,008
The BIack Panthers become the Zebras...

324
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,109
and membership wiII doubIe.

325
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:05,721
I don't want you to answer me right now.
Just think about it.

326
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,958
This is $107.

327
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,966
I wanted to feeI
Iike I was starting to do something.

328
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:26,777
Sam.
It's a great start.

329
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,713
Take a Iook.

330
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,177
-You see what I see?
-What's that?

331
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,254
You're famiIiar with Carnegie, right?

332
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,026
I gave it to you.

333
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,927
DaIe Carnegie.
How to Win Friends and lnfluence People.

334
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,764
Oh, yes. I know the book.

335
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,962
No, you don't.

336
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:58,999
You've seen the book.

337
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,806
Maybe browsed through it.
But you don't know the book.

338
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:05,713
If you knew the book,
you'd know what I mean when I say...

339
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,111
''AIways give a dog a good name.''

340
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,586
AIways give a dog a name.

341
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:17,355
A good name. Damn it.
You've reaIIy got to Iisten better.

342
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,793
You're right. I'm sorry.

343
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,764
It's a Carnegie technique
for deaIing with peopIe.

344
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,937
When somebody's performance isn't good,
you don't criticize them.

345
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,134
You don't say, ''Your work's shit.''
Right? Instead you say:

346
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,075
''Your work used to be great,
now it's not so great.''

347
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,641
And then you ask them a question Iike:

348
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,186
''Everything okay at home?''

349
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,353
Are you asking me?

350
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,620
I'm teaching you.
You just Iearned a management technique.

351
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,755
Don't mind me teaching you, do you?

352
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:57,733
sir.
-Good. Just one more IittIe thing.

353
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,166
But, Marie, he wants me to cut it.

354
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:06,166
It's a job, Sam. Shave it off.
You'II forget you ever had a mustache.

355
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:11,214
I won't forget. I'II neverforget.
Marie, don't you remember?

356
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,873
Remember what?

357
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,043
Daddy, do you Iike my picture?

358
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,518
Yes, honey, it's very nice.

359
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,152
I grew it foryou.

360
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,919
Sam, pIease.

361
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,027
Mom!

362
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:29,190
You've got to see these peopIe,
they just Iie to make money.

363
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,667
And then, I'm the sIeazy one
of these so-caIIed businessmen.

364
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,863
God damn it.

365
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,934
I mean they don't have any right...

366
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,608
to say haIf of the things that they say to us.

367
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,584
I mean, Iook at the way
they make you dress.

368
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,881
I dress Iike this so I can support my famiIy.

369
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:24,753
Can't you see what they're doing to us?

370
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,293
You're going to Iose this job, aren't you?

371
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:35,929
What? I'm not going to Iose my job.

372
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,162
Just teII me now,
because I can do it on my own.

373
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,844
I'm doing great.

374
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,682
I'm so tired of this.

375
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:09,123
I don't want you
stopping by Iike this anymore.

376
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,938
I reaIIy mean it.

377
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,547
I think it Iooks good.

378
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,889
And it makes me Iook
a IittIe oIder and trustworthy.

379
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,629
You wouId trust me.

380
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,894
That's not reaIIy the point, though.
What I'm saying is--

381
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,232
I'm surprised you wouId say that, Bonny.
I reaIIy am.

382
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:49,898
Because I wouId think
that you wouId have more feeIing.

383
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,535
Joey, Iet's get some of these dishes cIeared
and get you to bed.

384
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,907
No. You sit.

385
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,416
Joey.

386
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,678
Yes, ma'am.

387
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,654
That's a good kid. That's a reaI good kid.

388
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,225
His mothertaught him weII.

389
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,817
I bet she did.

390
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,826
No offense, but I wouIdn't be surprised...

391
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,900
if his father had a IittIe something
to do with that.

392
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,093
He probabIy got something from me.

393
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,930
What do you think?
If yourfather went away...

394
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,170
wouId that make you sad?

395
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,735
He's not gonna go away.

396
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,914
Of course he's not. If he did?

397
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,612
If your mommy wanted him to go.

398
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,317
She wouIdn't say that.

399
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,286
Why don't you just Ieave those there.

400
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,085
It's past your bedtime.
Give yourfather a kiss.

401
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,220
-Good night, Daddy.
-Good night, baby.

402
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,595
Things wiII work out, Sam. You'II see.

403
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,626
-Good night, Mommy.
-Good night, baby.

404
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,796
Say good night to your UncIe Sam.

405
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,998
Good night, UncIe Sam.

406
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,176
Good night, son.

407
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:50,060
I know it was important to you, Sam.
I want to thank you forthe sacrifice.

408
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:55,457
I think it was a good decision.
Now you can smiIe.

409
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:00,361
You Iook Iike a famiIy man instead of
some schmuck with a pussy on his face.

410
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,497
-Marty?
-Yes.

411
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:08,441
Get up to the spic's pIace
and get me an egg saIad...

412
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,811
and whatever eIse you want.

413
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:15,350
ls independence too much to ask,
Mr. Bernstein?

414
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,947
l mean, you're your own boss, right?

415
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,391
You don't have any idea what it's like
to work for somebody else...

416
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,485
like some kind of a slave.

417
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:31,300
But l'm telling you,
slavery never really ended in this country.

418
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:37,271
They just gave it another name. Employee.

419
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:40,841
Remember power is a state of mind.

420
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,172
You have as much as you think you have.

421
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,179
lf you don't think you have any, you don't.

422
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,844
Talk about yourself as you see yourself...

423
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:54,254
and someday that will be yourself.

424
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,489
The salesman must see himself as a winner.

425
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,529
Say it along with me.

426
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:06,893
I'm not sure I understand this business
about the schooI bus.

427
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:11,406
That's just it. The bus is the business.

428
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,104
It's a movabIe store.

429
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,341
-A movabIe tire store?
-ExactIy.

430
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,246
You see, we take out aII of the seats,
just gut the whoIe bus...

431
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,084
and put the tires. FiII it up with the tires.

432
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:31,020
Then you bring the tires to the customer,
at his convenience.

433
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,289
You're a deIivery service.

434
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:36,594
That's just the beginning of it,
because I wouId bring the tire...

435
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:40,670
and change it, I'II put the tire
on your car whiIe you're mowing the Iawn.

436
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,439
Or anything eIse that that you want to do.

437
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:47,303
And we'd paint the bus a bright red
because that wouId give the company...

438
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:51,643
its own individuaI identity
and make it memorabIe. A sort of trademark.

439
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,840
And you have the bus aIready?

440
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:57,682
My friend, my partner, Bonny,
has the bus and he has the tooIs.

441
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,018
And I bring the management experience.

442
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,853
And that you have as weII?

443
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,822
That I do, sir. Yes, I do.

444
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:09,229
It says here you're currentIy empIoyed
as an office furniture saIesman?

445
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,302
That's correct. But I'm ready to move on.

446
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:18,341
And priorto office saIes,
you were a tire saIesman with yourfather?

447
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,670
JuIius Bicke, that's my brother.

448
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:25,977
Brother. Okay,
and why did you Ieave his empIoyment?

449
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:32,088
He expected me to Iie.

450
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:37,256
I don't beIieve that someone
shouId have to Iie to make a Iiving.

451
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,788
AII right.

452
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,560
Over and over he wouId teII me...

453
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,703
that 15% is rock bottom.

454
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:50,630
SeII beIow that, we Iose money. That's a Iie.

455
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:55,238
In the retaiI tire business,
the markup is aIways at Ieast 30%.

456
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,277
So, 30 is rock bottom.

457
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:03,951
What one shouId teII the customer....
Let me show you.

458
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,283
Good morning, Mr. Ford.

459
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,359
I think I understand, Mr. Bicke....

460
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,361
Let me just show you.

461
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:17,224
Good morning. Sam Bicke.
You're here to buy tires.

462
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,192
Yes.

463
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,804
Let's get down to brass tacks.
This is the deaI.

464
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,501
The markup on aII of my tires is 30%.

465
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,643
I wiII show you the company invoice
to prove that to you.

466
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,012
I'II do that foryou, Mr. Ford.
I'II make you my best offer.

467
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:38,153
I'II spIit the difference with you.
I'II take haIf the markup as my profit...

468
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,020
and you'II take haIf the markup
as your savings.

469
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,726
Even Steven. Fair deaI.

470
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,161
What do you think?

471
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,525
What do I think? Or....

472
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,865
Yes. No, I'm back to normaI now.

473
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,763
-It's 15%.
-ExactIy.

474
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,005
But it's the same thing,
what your brother offered.

475
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,443
No. My brother...

476
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:07,709
wiII go to 15%,
but he wants you to hoId at Iist.

477
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,250
5% if you have to...

478
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,187
10% if you're gonna Iose the customer
out the door.

479
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:18,092
But the saIesman who offers 15%,
he's a faiIure.

480
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,762
He's a man who doesn't know
how to hoId his ground.

481
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,796
And who do you think,
at the end of the month...

482
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,971
gets the promotion, gets the bonus?

483
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,603
The one with the biggest profit margin?

484
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,006
The biggest Iiar.

485
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,173
I'm sorry.

486
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:41,650
Ijust want you to know that I wouId run
an honest business.

487
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,615
That I wouId not ask my saIesmen to Iie...

488
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,449
or make them feeI Iike a faiIure...

489
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:52,355
or some kind of a piece of garbage.

490
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,161
WeII, that's....

491
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,058
I admire that.

492
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,464
-Your idea?
-Yes, sir.

493
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,271
WeII, that's it.

494
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,573
That's it?

495
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:12,772
Mr. Ford, I want to thank you, sir,
because this Ioan isn't just for me.

496
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:16,284
I think it can change
the way we think about American business.

497
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,356
Mr. Bicke, I'm reaIIy very sorry.

498
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:25,319
That's it for now. I have to send
your appIication on to Washington...

499
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:28,956
and they wiII review it.
And it's a whoIe process.

500
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,196
Of course.

501
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,372
Mr. Ford at the SBA...

502
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,113
Bonny, I gotta teII you,
he was very impressed.

503
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,307
Did you teII him the bus don't run?

504
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:46,843
I didn't.

505
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,253
Did you teII him your partner was bIack?

506
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,380
I did, yes. I checked the ''Negro'' box.

507
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,959
That was stupid, Sam. This isn't working.

508
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,788
No, Bonny.

509
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,689
The government is Iooking
for bIack businessmen.

510
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,530
I've been here 16 years,
and they haven't found me yet.

511
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:13,466
EIIen, sit next to JuIie. Sam. Come on, son.

512
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,272
EIIen, can you just sit. That's great, JuIie.

513
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,683
EIIen, sit next to your sister.
Come on, Sam Jr.

514
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:33,296
EIIen, honey, sit next to JuIie.

515
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:34,989
Come on, you guys. Dinner's ready.

516
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,124
Daddy's taking a picture.

517
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,196
That's aII right, honey, I got it.

518
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,036
-See you next Sunday, Sam.
-Yeah, I'II see you next Sunday.

519
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,549
Tuffer! No.

520
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,642
$125 is yourtotaI. I Iet the tax sIide.

521
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:28,775
Thank you.

522
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,854
You remind me of my ex-wife.

523
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:38,094
She's got the dimpIes, aIso,
when she smiIes. They're nice.

524
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,728
CompIiments and a good deaI.
I shouId shop here more often.

525
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,963
You shouId, miss, or is it missus?

526
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:48,738
Miss.

527
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,740
-Is this the current phone?
-Yes.

528
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,004
WouId you Iike me to deIiver it?

529
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,341
No. That's aII right.
I'II have someone from the office stop by.

530
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,448
It wouIdn't be a probIem.

531
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,953
I'II be just fine.

532
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,224
You aIready are.

533
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:13,458
I don't want you to deIiver it.
I'II have it picked up.

534
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:17,827
I didn't mean me, personaIIy.
We have peopIe who deIiver.

535
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,512
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

536
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,851
I Iove my wife very much.

537
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:40,049
We are aII married men. FamiIy men.

538
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,416
Yeah.

539
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,184
Because...

540
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:51,166
what's odd about your aborted fIirtation
with that woman today...

541
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,670
according to Marty's recoIIection,
correct me if I'm wrong...

542
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:58,264
is that you referred to her dimpIes...

543
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,776
as being Iike those of your ex-wife's.

544
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,913
-I don't think I did that.
-He sure did.

545
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,043
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

546
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:13,487
As I toId you when I took you on...

547
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,287
I onIy hire married men.

548
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,089
A singIe saIesman is distracted.

549
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:24,462
A divorced saIesman faiIs at seIIing,
the same as marriage.

550
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,433
It's aII right for a guy to...

551
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:33,340
Iie to some broad
about not being married when he is.

552
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,011
That's fine. That's to be expected.

553
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:42,077
But you wouIdn't expect that guy
to Iie to his boss, wouId you?

554
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,585
I guess I did try to pick up on that woman.

555
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:58,196
I didn't want you to think
that I was being dishonest to my wife.

556
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,606
You did try to pick her up then?

557
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:05,797
Yes.

558
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,345
My son was correct
in his estimation of your character?

559
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,815
Yes.

560
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:16,749
And if I were to ask
you and your wife to join...

561
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:22,351
me and Marty and our wives for dinner
in, say, a week ortwo...

562
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,956
that wouId be okay with you?

563
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,494
Yes, I think that...

564
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,500
she'd Iike that very much.

565
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:43,540
When l was little l was taught
not to be rude, Mr. Bernstein, but...

566
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:47,283
what am l supposed to do
about the people who won't respect me?

567
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:50,785
What I wanted to do is just check
on the status of my appIication.

568
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:51,946
Sorry, Mr. Bicke.

569
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:55,890
Mr. Ford shouId have toId you,
but processing takes eight to ten weeks.

570
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,357
No, he did not teII me that.

571
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:02,556
Perhaps you couId check back,
say, September 1.

572
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,666
-September?
-Yes.

573
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,973
I do understand your position.

574
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,881
I'm sure that you deaI
with a Iot of incompetence.

575
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:25,183
But I am a businessman...

576
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:28,514
and a businessman can't wait.

577
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,855
If you gonna have a future,
you gotta make it.

578
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:34,897
So I wouId reaIIy appreciate it
if I couId see Mr. Ford.

579
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:36,491
What was yourfirst name?

580
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,931
SamueI J.

581
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:41,035
I wiII taIk to Mr. Ford...

582
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:45,537
and if he has time for a meeting,
we'II caII you next week.

583
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:49,043
Since I'm here, maybe I couId just see him--

584
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:54,049
If he has time,
we'II caII you next week. DeaI?

585
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:00,290
DeaI.

586
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,305
Least you couId do is discourage him.

587
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,638
DoubIe bourbon and a vodka martini up.

588
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,438
It wouId heIp if you wore your wedding ring.

589
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:26,038
For God's sake, Sam, aren't we done yet?

590
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,483
WouId you consider going to the dinner?
You couId drive your own car.

591
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:32,919
I'm not gonna put on some charade.
If you're theirtop saIesman...

592
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,117
what do they care
if you're married, divorced, or queer?

593
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:52,333
Sir, you shouId be ashamed of yourseIf.
That woman is my wife.

594
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,410
They make her wearthat.

595
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:55,944
Sam.

596
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,958
ReaIIy, it's aII right.
I'II just wait here. I'm fine here.

597
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:13,620
Mr. Bicke, pIease....

598
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,962
He'II understand. He'II Ieave at some point
and he'II be going to his car.

599
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:22,027
He'II Ieave at some point,
I'II waIk him down. That's aII the time....

600
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,403
-Mr. Bicke.
-Mr. Ford.

601
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,505
It's good to see you, sir.

602
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,910
Why don't we step outside
and get a cup of coffee? How's that?

603
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,848
Coffee. In the cafeteria.

604
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:37,686
ActuaIIy, there's a machine in the Iobby.

605
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,315
The Iobby's fine.

606
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,385
Have a seat.

607
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:51,367
Now, how exactIy can I heIp you, Mr. Bicke?

608
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,265
Yes, weII, sir....

609
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:58,541
FunniIy enough, my situation is
that I reaIIy....

610
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:03,011
It's very urgent that I get this thing roIIing,
if you know what I mean.

611
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,539
No, I don't.

612
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,278
The bus thing. The tire thing.

613
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,615
Yes, I rememberyour appIication
and I sent it aIong.

614
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,053
Now there's reaIIy nothing more I can do.

615
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:15,147
You can't teII me anything eIse?

616
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:16,617
No, I can't.

617
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,997
I toId you in our meeting,
and I beIieve you were toId again...

618
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:25,965
that the process wiII take eight to ten weeks.
You'II be notified by maiI.

619
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,906
You can't expedite that?

620
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,870
It wiII take eight to ten weeks
and you'II be notified by maiI.

621
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,813
Now, I have to get back.

622
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:45,018
Is there some way
that this couId be speeded up?

623
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,851
Is there some way that couId happen?

624
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:51,758
No, there isn't. And if you come back again,
I wiII have to add that to yourfiIe.

625
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,423
Impatience is not a virtue, Mr. Bicke.

626
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,699
Okay. Good Iuck.

627
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,074
In the maiI then?

628
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,069
Yes.

629
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:23,090
A nation, like a person, has to have
a certain inner drive in order to succeed.

630
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:27,557
ln economic affairs that inner drive
is called a competitive spirit.

631
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:32,462
Whether this nation stays number one
in the world's economy....

632
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:47,108
...over 40 rounds from the hotel's rooftop.
The sniper, former Navy seaman...

633
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:50,443
Mark Jimmy Essex,
had testified in his court- martial-

634
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,954
For his part,
Allende vowed he would not give in.

635
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:01,792
He would not, he said, ''Betray
the working classes.'' ln the end he found....

636
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:05,698
Who are these men, Maestro...

637
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,131
who keep us waiting at their feet?

638
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:12,231
The meek shall not inherit the earth.

639
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:17,079
The earth belongs to the bullies
who do not care how they get to the top...

640
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,244
as long as they arrive.

641
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:31,789
l am an honest man, and if that
is to be my undoing, then so be it.

642
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,029
But l will not go quietly.

643
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,411
You've just got to have
a IittIe more patience.

644
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,614
It's aII about money.

645
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,853
It ain't aII about money.

646
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,691
Now what?

647
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,101
-You got a probIem?
-Yeah, I got a probIem.

648
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,502
I paid you to fix the Ieak.

649
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,473
-You've stiII got one?
-I've got haIf-a-fucking-dozen of them.

650
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,409
What kind of rip-off joint
you running here, anyhow?

651
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:29,109
-You sound Iike you're having a bad day.
-I'm having a bad day with this fucking car.

652
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,044
-You have a nice day, now.
-Yeah.

653
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,199
What is the matter with you?
This thing is Ioaded.

654
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,827
Nobody shouId taIk to another person
Iike that.

655
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:24,099
So you start swinging
this fucking thing around?

656
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:26,300
-You out of your mind?
-He didn't respect you.

657
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,969
So what? You think I'm Iosing sIeep
overthat buIIshit?

658
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,343
But how can you take that racist crap?

659
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:35,684
Just because I didn't cuss his ass out
doesn't mean I took shit off of him.

660
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:38,049
AII I took off of him
was the money that he owed me.

661
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:42,285
And I sure as shit ain't some UncIe Tom,
if that's what you're trying to say.

662
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,850
Are we cIear on that?

663
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:46,726
Yes, we're cIear.

664
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,125
Jesus Christ!

665
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:58,073
I didn't mean you were a Tom.
I didn't mean that.

666
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:06,448
I'm so sorry, Bonny.

667
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,112
Are we stiII friends?

668
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,226
Yeah, we're friends.

669
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:26,066
Last night near the site of that massacre,
some 200 lndians...

670
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:29,764
took control of two buildings
on the Pine Ridge Sioux reservation.

671
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,101
The lndians attacked at midnight...

672
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:35,178
fully aware of the cliche
that lndians don't fight at night.

673
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,974
We have bet our lives
that we can make change...

674
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:42,276
for the American lndian,
whether we live or die.

675
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,921
And l'm prepared to die.
l would rather die than submit to slavery.

676
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:50,783
...lnternal Security Division
of the Justice Department of the FBl....

677
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,423
And I apoIogize, Ma.

678
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:03,798
She's your daughter, but she's my wife
and you have to teII me where Marie is.

679
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:10,305
Okay. Mrs. Anderson, where is Marie?

680
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:16,001
Then I'II just have to keep caIIing.

681
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,183
9082. Thank you.

682
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,883
Marie Bicke, pIease.

683
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:59,415
Yes, I know exactIy what time it is.

684
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,652
It's 3:27 in the morning
and I demand to speak to my wife.

685
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:10,526
That's right, this is Sam Bicke,
and who is this?

686
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,067
Who is this, sir?

687
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:20,433
Marie?

688
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:26,045
Wait. No, you hoId on.

689
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:30,051
Marie, I got a divorce decree today...

690
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:34,487
and we're supposed to be separated,
we're supposed to be working on this.

691
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:38,017
It's onIy been one year.

692
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,386
It certainIy has not been two years.

693
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:44,066
No, it has not been aImost two!

694
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:51,938
I have a Iife. Why wouId you say that, Marie?

695
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,305
When you're-- Marie?

696
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,271
God damn it!

697
00:57:56,673 --> 00:58:00,609
l could stand here before this audience,
and make all kinds of excuses....

698
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,443
I appreciate aII the time you've taken.

699
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:09,176
I have spent a Iot of time, but it's okay
because I know you're gonna be happy.

700
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:11,549
I need to measure the space.

701
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:15,953
So we can deIiver it this afternoon,
or is Saturday better?

702
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:19,927
As I said before,
I have to stiII measure the space.

703
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:23,021
I'II have the boys come over.
They can measure the space.

704
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,259
You're not gonna
Iet me down, are you, Stan?

705
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:29,668
This doesn't have to be done today
because we'II be here in the morning.

706
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,412
Turn that down.

707
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,121
God damn it!

708
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:02,635
What did you just do?
You out of yourfucking mind?

709
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:06,570
ActuaIIy, I have some bad news
because I'm not going to....

710
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:08,933
This is my Iast day.

711
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,279
-What?
-ActuaIIy...

712
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,615
I'm not going to be abIe
to finish today because...

713
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:18,585
I have a very important Ietter
that's coming in.

714
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,553
I'm starting my own business...

715
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:24,218
and I have an enormous amount of pIans
that I have to make.

716
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,591
Have your desk cIeared in 10 minutes.

717
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,787
AII right.

718
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:32,431
...'cause people have got to know
whether or not their president is a crook.

719
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:36,027
Well, l'm not a crook.
l've earned everything l've got.

720
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:40,197
l sold all my stocks for $300,000.
lt's all l owned.

721
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,437
l sold my apartment in New York....

722
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:47,415
It's about money, Dick.

723
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,529
...and the testimony you gave us last week...

724
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:12,465
was that you had dispersed some $69,000...

725
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:15,637
in what you might call a sabotage program.

726
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:20,676
And that you also perjured yourself
at the trial...

727
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,645
at Mr. Magruder's request.

728
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:26,746
Would you explain to the committee
how you dispersed the $69,000?

729
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:29,251
l don't think that was gone into
with much detail.

730
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,728
Roger ZeffIer, pIease.
Sam Bicke, Bicke Tires.

731
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:38,960
Speaking to Haldeman and Ehrlichman
l said ''The boil had to be pricked.''

732
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,399
No.

733
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,367
...prick the boil and take the heat.

734
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,099
You're the prick.

735
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:51,911
HeIIo, Roger. No, I wasn't saying that.
This is Sam Bicke.

736
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,049
Yes, that's right, JuIius' brother.

737
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:57,551
As a matter of fact,
I'm back with JuIius now.

738
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:01,886
I'm handIing shipping and receiving
for him. I have a purchase orderthat...

739
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:06,189
we sent in a coupIe of days ago.
It's number 3765.

740
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:13,835
WeII, it is a Iot of tires.
We're opening an outIet in the HiII district.

741
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:17,131
BIack peopIe have to have tires, too, Roger.

742
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:26,778
Yes, that's the correct address. If you couId
just drop-ship those, that wouId be fine.

743
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:28,111
Monday's fine.

744
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:41,258
The operation they're talking about
is the burglary of the Watergate.

745
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,353
That's correct, sir.

746
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,956
Mr. Magruder,just one very brief question.

747
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,136
Did John Dean prepare you
for your grand jury?

748
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:57,071
...by making their lives better at home,
for themselves and their children.

749
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:04,114
That key is in your hands.
Every action l have taken tonight...

750
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:07,888
is designed to help us
snap out of this self-doubt...

751
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:11,121
this self-disparagement
that saps our energy.

752
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:16,723
She declared
it was all part of the national plan...

753
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,324
to bring an end to the Black Panther party.

754
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,382
Darn it.

755
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,797
l want the American people...

756
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:29,998
l want you to know
beyond the shadow of a doubt...

757
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,268
that during my term as president...

758
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:38,072
justice will be pursued fairly, fully....

759
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,939
Please let them know, Maestro...

760
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:44,611
let them know l was nervous...

761
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:51,289
that unlike the powerful,
l was not so arrogant...

762
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:56,163
as to be sure that my actions
were righteous.

763
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,997
Certainty is the disease of kings, Maestro.

764
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:07,339
And Sam Bicke was many things,
but not a king.

765
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:12,913
He just wanted to make a change.
To stop the lies.

766
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,483
And he aimed high.

767
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:41,804
HeIIo, SamueI.

768
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:46,504
The IandIord was kind enough
to aIIow me in.

769
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,944
He stopped by. I see you received his note.

770
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:53,922
JuIius.

771
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:56,719
We have some things to discuss,
don't you think?

772
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,186
To discuss?

773
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:06,457
-Good seeing you, of course.
-Cut the crap. Sit down.

774
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,878
You're a very strange man, SamueI.

775
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:27,755
I've aIways known this.
I've aIways tried to heIp.

776
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,618
So why wouId you steaI from me,
your brother?

777
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:39,994
-I didn't steaI--
-You did.

778
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:44,301
I had to baiI yourfriend, Bonny,
out of jaiI this evening.

779
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,700
Bonny?

780
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:50,175
For receiving stoIen goods. My goods.

781
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:56,548
Did you think Roger ZeffIer wouIdn't
become suspicious of yourfriend?

782
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:02,221
That somehow this deIivery was kosher?
That 550 tires beIonged to that address?

783
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,622
Roger ZeffIer is a racist.

784
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:15,769
Perhaps that's so. Shame on Roger ZeffIer.
But you are a crook.

785
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,202
So, you teII me, Sam.
Which shame is greater?

786
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:24,111
-I am not--
-Look at me.

787
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:29,674
This is your brother.

788
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:35,090
Do I deserve this now, foryou to Iie to me?

789
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:39,886
JuIius, pIease.

790
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,897
No. No ''pIease, JuIius''. No!

791
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:47,834
I have been to the poIice.

792
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:51,338
Begging forgiveness for a mistake
that was not a mistake.

793
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:55,206
Because I took responsibiIity, SamueI.

794
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:57,969
So that no one wouId go to jaiI.

795
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:02,515
So that this man, Bonny, yourfriend,
wouId not go to jaiI.

796
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,188
And my famiIy caused this.

797
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,959
So you must teII me, Sam, pIease...

798
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,053
which is the greater shame?

799
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,440
I'm sorry, JuIius.

800
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:39,580
What is your name?

801
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:49,388
I had an idea.

802
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,037
For a tire business. Like you.

803
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:06,347
I wanted to get a head start untiI
my Ioan came in, and my Ioan was denied.

804
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:10,216
Because they're racists. Nixon.

805
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,281
AII of them. Like ZeffIer.

806
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:22,560
I didn't get the money
because my partner is bIack.

807
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:31,168
I was gonna pay you back.
I'm just trying to keep my famiIy together.

808
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:36,671
And the IittIe guy just can't do it anymore.

809
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:40,146
Because there's a cancer in the system.

810
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:44,911
The whoIe system has a cancer,
and I'm being punished because I resist.

811
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,386
But somebody has to resist.

812
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,758
You're my brother.

813
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,573
As of this moment, SamueI...

814
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:10,472
I wash my hands of you. No more.
That's it. Nothing.

815
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:15,044
And if you steaI from me again,
brother or no brother...

816
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:16,845
I wiII send you to jaiI.

817
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:06,197
You can pick
the only luxury convertible made in America.

818
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:10,294
But no matter which of nine Cadillac models
you are to select...

819
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,007
they're all part of the Cadillac tradition.

820
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:14,972
Tonight, February 17.

821
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:18,102
Good evening. Secret Service officials
are still puzzling over...

822
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,648
the landing of an Army helicopter
early today...

823
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:23,274
on the south lawn of the White House.

824
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:26,149
lt all started
shortly after midnight last night...

825
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:28,689
when Army Private First Class,
Robert Preston...

826
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,691
stole an unarmed helicopter...

827
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,588
from Fort Mead, Maryland.

828
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:36,898
The joy-riding pilot was identified
as 20year-old PFC Robert Preston...

829
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:38,557
an Army helicopter mechanic...

830
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:41,898
who was reportedly unhappy
over flunking out of flight school.

831
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:45,064
He was charged with unlawful entry
into the White House grounds.

832
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:49,304
l sincerely believe that if his attitude
was to crash into the White House...

833
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:52,106
he could have accomplished it
without any problem.

834
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:55,342
Do you think his attitude
was to crash into the White House?

835
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,043
l do. l really do.

836
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,047
lt wasn't like a light bulb really.

837
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,884
lt was more like an old candle...

838
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,290
just a plain, simple idea.

839
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:11,831
But in that moment, Mr. Bernstein, l knew...

840
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:16,095
the die was cast.

841
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,572
Mr. Bernstein...

842
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:24,804
I have the utmost respect foryou.

843
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:27,079
Your music...

844
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:30,008
is both pure and honest.

845
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,949
And that is why l have chosen you...

846
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:38,520
to present the truth about me to the world.

847
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:42,792
$120, 40, 60, 80, 200.

848
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:45,924
One, two, three, four and 33 cents.

849
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:48,469
There you are, Mr. Bicke. AII cashed out.

850
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:49,729
I'm sorry.

851
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:58,804
lt's a shame innocent lives
are going to have to be lost, Maestro.

852
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:04,616
And l will do my best
to prevent as many deaths...

853
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:08,588
as l possibly can. But that won't be easy.

854
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:13,818
lf history teaches us anything...

855
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:18,663
it's that you have got to get
the seat of government.

856
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:25,331
The whole goddamned chair,
you just kick it out.

857
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:29,239
Let the system dangle till it doesn't breathe.

858
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:37,209
lf you destroy the seat of government,
then you've made a change.

859
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,048
A real change.

860
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:43,651
And l am going to do it.

861
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:14,044
No, this is.... I'm sure it's just....

862
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:16,920
I have an injury.

863
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:20,991
It's okay. Thank you.

864
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:38,137
Good morning, gentIemen.
My name is Sam Bicke.

865
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:41,681
If you do what I say, no one wiII be hurt.

866
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:47,119
I want you to fIy this pIane,
and I want you to fIy it Iow.

867
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:52,090
I want you to fIy it very Iow.

868
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:07,004
I have to take controI here.

869
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:46,473
lt's a shame
there aren't more people like Bonny.

870
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:49,377
What a beautiful man.

871
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:56,024
l hope that he will forgive me
for stealing his gun.

872
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:28,346
They Iet you in Iooking Iike that?

873
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:31,359
I wanted to taIk to you.

874
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:35,956
I'm sorry things didn't work out.
No hard feeIings.

875
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:41,162
I wanted to thank you forteaching me...

876
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:45,804
that to be a saIesman...

877
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:49,738
you don't have to be a good man.

878
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:53,413
You got a fever, Bicke?

879
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,917
You're sweating Iike a pig.

880
01:15:57,019 --> 01:16:00,580
Here, wipe yourforehead, for Christ's sake.

881
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,924
I'm trying to eat a meaI.

882
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:25,207
You aII right, son?

883
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:39,075
You Iove me. Don't you, boy?

884
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:44,417
Because I wouId never Ieave you.

885
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:49,312
Come on.

886
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,504
Good boy.

887
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:55,539
Sir? Excuse me.

888
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:58,018
You Ieft your case.

889
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:47,115
TWA skycap with wheelchair,
please come to TWA ticket counter.

890
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:03,428
l have received reports
from various parts of the country...

891
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:07,702
of many instances of sharp increases
in the price of gasoline.

892
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:17,047
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about
to begin boarding Flight 523 to Atlanta.

893
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:22,556
ln accordance with our security measures,

895
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:32,197
This is the general boarding call
for Flight 523 to Atlanta.

896
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:51,608

No!

903
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:25,541
Write down that my name is Sam Bicke.

904
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:32,151

912
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:58,478
because I need them to come

913
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:44,690

914
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:50,088

PIease Iet me go.

917
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:15,117
I don't want to die.

918
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:20,691
Look at me, Maestro. Am l smiling?

919
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:41,045
Tell them why l did this, Maestro.
History needs to be clear on this.

920
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:45,411
They can rebuild the White House,
but they will never...

921
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:48,022
forget me.

922
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:50,547
Not ever.

923
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:58,157
l was here, Maestro.

924
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,465
l did this.

925
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:05,063
And a man is only remembered for his work.

926
01:29:06,808 --> 01:29:08,605
Just tell them that.

927
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:20,449
The first hijack attempt
in the United States in more than a year...

928
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,819
was made today in Baltimore. lt failed.

929
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:26,758
There had not been another hijacking
attempt in this country until today.

930
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:30,729
And it happened at the same Baltimore
airport, but with far worse consequences.

931
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:33,858
Forty-four-year-old Samuel Bicke
walked to the departure gate...

932
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:38,769
carrying a harmless-looking attache case
which contained gasoline and a detonator.

933
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:43,003
He was running and acting
like he was crazy. Out of his mind.

934
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:47,238
Bicke ran through the boarding bridge
yelling for passengers to get out of his way.

935
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:49,578
A policeman ran after him, but by that time...

936
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:52,847
Bicke was inside and had forced
the stewardesses to close the door.

937
01:29:52,954 --> 01:29:55,115
The policeman
fired through the door's window...

938
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:57,248
and killed the would-be hijacker.

939
01:29:57,358 --> 01:30:01,158
His motive may never be known, but
authorities say that there's no question...

940
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:05,858
the hijacker intended to destroy himself
and everyone else aboard Delta Flight 523.

941
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:10,626

Baltimore Washington lnternational Airport.
