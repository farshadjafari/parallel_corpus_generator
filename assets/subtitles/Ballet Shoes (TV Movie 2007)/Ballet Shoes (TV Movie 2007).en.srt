1
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:24,190
999, indeed.

2
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,007
I haven't heard of such
a number for a house.

3
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:31,788
Yes?

4
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:35,067
Forgive my boldness, sir,
but wooden leg or no wooden leg,

5
00:00:35,147 --> 00:00:37,787
you are this child's
last surviving relative.

6
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:40,745
Her father named you
as guardian in his will.

7
00:00:40,785 --> 00:00:42,784
Yeah. I don't dispute that.

8
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:43,904
I merely point out

9
00:00:43,984 --> 00:00:45,904
that this house is a shrine
to paleontology.

10
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:49,183
There's no corner in it for
a small girl... or her nurse.

11
00:00:49,263 --> 00:00:50,782
We require two rooms.
That is all.

12
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:52,622
Some of these stones
could go to a museum.

13
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:55,261
My fossils?
In a public museum?

14
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:57,300
This has got nothing to do
with fossils.

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,659
If you don't want the child,
you should say it straight out.

16
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,260
But she'd be miserable here.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,419
My parents are dead.

18
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,258
I'd be miserable anywhere.

19
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:12,696
Smilodon Popularis.

20
00:01:12,776 --> 00:01:15,854
Why don't you just stick a knife
in my heart?

21
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:17,335
They're all magnets for dust,

22
00:01:17,415 --> 00:01:19,974
and that big cat
was plain unpleasant.

23
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:22,773
It's a saber-toothed tiger,
Nana.

24
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:27,052
It's lovely.

25
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,729
An armadillo skeleton!

26
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:38,888
Goodbye!

27
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,320
I keep a pack of women
in this house!

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,759
There isn't one of them about
anywhere when they're wanted!

29
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,078
Oh! Darling Gum!

30
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:14,678
We weren't expecting you.

31
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:16,877
Oh, ship sank... iceberg.

32
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:19,356
If you don't mind me asking,
what have you got in the bag?

33
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:21,715
Ah. A surprise.

34
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:23,195
Let's hope it's not
another fossil.

35
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:25,474
The world is full
of entrancements, woman.

36
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:28,233
Not all of them
are made of stone.

37
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:31,233
A baby?

38
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:33,752
Found it...
floating on a lifeboat.

39
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:35,631
Both parents drowned.
Awful bloody shame.

40
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:38,190
A baby? A baby just like that?
What will people say?

41
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,270
Have you no regard for
your great-niece's reputation?

42
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,948
Well, I-I'll put
a notice in <i>The Times...</i>

43
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:46,827
"Professor Matthew Brown adopts
entirely unrelated child."

44
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:49,387
-But, Gum...
-I thought women liked babies.

45
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:52,746
They like babies that are in
good order... babies with names.

46
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:56,425
Ah.
Well, I thought perhaps Pauline.

47
00:02:58,064 --> 00:02:59,624
And surnames.

48
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:01,983
Fossil.

49
00:03:04,423 --> 00:03:06,942
It's not as though we've got
an empty room to put her in.

50
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,500
You don't mind, do you?

51
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,820
Gum, I came here
with nothing once.

52
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,179
That's the spirit.

53
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:17,298
Where are you actually going?

54
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:20,338
Siberia.
I'll bring you back a souvenir.

55
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:34,093
No. Not another one.

56
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,333
Mm.

57
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:37,733
Red Cross hospital
outside Vladivostok.

58
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:39,572
Mother died when it was born.

59
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:40,891
What about the father?

60
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,571
Salt mines... worked to death.

61
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:44,090
Awful bloody end.

62
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,410
Yeah, they called it Petrova.
Needs feeding up a bit.

63
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:51,488
It is to be hoped
this one has brains.

64
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:54,928
It's easy to see who's going to
be misplaying in my nursery.

65
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:05,804
"Dearest niece,

66
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:08,964
another small Fossil
from your Great-Uncle Matthew.

67
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:10,363
Daughter of a dancer.

68
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:13,202
Mother has no money
and no time for her offspring.

69
00:04:13,282 --> 00:04:16,360
She sends a pair
of ballet shoes enclosed."

70
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,440
He says, " I regret
not delivering the child myself,

71
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,199
but I ran into a friend about
to leave for the Galápagos.

72
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,238
There's enough money in the bank
to last you for five years.

73
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:30,117
P. S... Child's name Posy.

74
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:32,316
Unfortunate but true."

75
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:34,676
Ballet shoes, indeed.

76
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:36,395
Change of clothes
would be more useful.

77
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:38,674
Or a feeding bottle.

78
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:41,594
"To the little Fossils."

79
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,992
"Turquoise for Pauline.

80
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:47,911
Pearls for Petrova.

81
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:49,471
Coral for Posy."

82
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:51,231
Make the most of it.

83
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:53,950
That'll be the last we hear
from him for quite some time.

84
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:58,029
I bet Gum had a car.

85
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:59,908
Only a man with a car
would've bought a house

86
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:02,947
at the far end
of the longest road in London.

87
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:05,546
Garnie said he used to
come and go in taxis.

88
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:06,946
I wish we could.

89
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:09,385
I'd be happy
if they let us get the bus.

90
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:11,264
The professor may have had
his faults, Petrova.

91
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,064
Might I remind you,
he had but the single leg.

92
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:14,704
You three have got
a full pair each.

93
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:17,063
So you can save the penny
and walk and be thankful.

94
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:18,982
The Rockefeller family
we are not.

95
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:21,141
At least you get to go
to school.

96
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,981
I still have to do lessons
with Garnie

97
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:26,260
and take an extra walk
at lunchtime every day.

98
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,899
If I have to look
at the dolls' houses

99
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:30,178
in the museum one more time,
I shall be sick.

100
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:31,179
That's enough, Miss Madam.

101
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,058
All over my outdoor shoes.

102
00:05:33,138 --> 00:05:35,497
Then I shan't be able
to go anywhere.

103
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:44,694
We've had more fuss from
Miss Posy about her education.

104
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:46,973
Cromwell House is out
of the question, isn't it?

105
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,253
It's not just that I can't send
Posy to Cromwell House.

106
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:54,171
Give it here!
Get off!

107
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:56,571
I'm having to take
the other two away.

108
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:58,810
I have to give notice to Clara.

109
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,929
There's no money left.

110
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,889
Nothing in the bank at all.

111
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:05,688
I'm so sorry.

112
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:07,448
Why are you apologizing?

113
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:09,087
It's not news.

114
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:10,566
Isn't it?

115
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:13,966
Been looking through
situations vacant in the papers.

116
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:16,165
I didn't think you'd notice.

117
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,684
I brought you up.
I notice everything.

118
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:20,164
The trouble is, Nana,

119
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:23,363
unless somebody advertises for
a paleontologist's assistant,

120
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:24,962
I'm not qualified for anything.

121
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:28,762
There's a way 'round everything
if you stop and think.

122
00:06:45,757 --> 00:06:47,476
I finished my fractions.

123
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:48,555
Already?

124
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:50,595
They were the hardest
in the book.

125
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,755
She'll have to sit there quietly
with her magazine.

126
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:54,514
You can't be setting
any more sums.

127
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,153
You've got to go to Selfridges
and get those eiderdowns.

128
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:59,472
Petrova, darling, would you go?

129
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,112
You're only reading.

130
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:06,990
-Good afternoon.
-I like your car.

131
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:10,069
How are you finding
the acceleration?

132
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:13,108
Terrific. Naught to 40
in about three minutes.

133
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:16,267
Is your mother at home?

134
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:18,267
Oh, we haven't got a mother.
And it's all right.

135
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:20,306
You don't have to say
you're sorry.

136
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:23,145
How do you do?
I've just come about the room.

137
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:25,104
Oh, do come in.

138
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:28,104
Forgive me. I was trying
to clean a fireplace.

139
00:07:31,302 --> 00:07:33,862
I don't know how long I'd stay.

140
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:35,901
I've only just got back
from Kuala Lumpur.

141
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:37,421
Petrova! Have you been...

142
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:41,139
Well, um...
there's no minimum agreement.

143
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:42,940
Nana,
Petrova's been wearing my...

144
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:44,699
This is nice.

145
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:50,337
Put photographs on here.

146
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:56,855
Good afternoon.

147
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,415
Have you come about the rooms?

148
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:01,454
With particular regard
to shelves.

149
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,333
And smoking.

150
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:04,692
I'm Dr. Smith.

151
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:05,972
This is Dr. Jakes.

152
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,332
Do come in.

153
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:12,130
Rather smart.

154
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,889
Very nice aesthetic.

155
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:15,730
Come in.

156
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:17,969
Nana said you might need this.

157
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:20,928
Oh! How kind.

158
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,288
Thank you, my dear.

159
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:25,647
Well, we... we both had
lengthy careers in academia.

160
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:27,366
It all adds up
to quite a lot of books.

161
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:29,005
Most of them hers.

162
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:31,045
I specialized in Shakespeare.

163
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:33,244
Dr. Smith is a mathematician.

164
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:35,164
Where do you go to school,
child?

165
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:36,203
We don't.

166
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,962
Garnie, our guardian,
teaches us from home.

167
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:39,283
Good God, that must be dull.

168
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:43,281
Oh, that is quite an adventure,
having relatives by accident.

169
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:45,160
Such a unique name.

170
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,480
Fossil.

171
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,640
I suppose it is.

172
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,559
I always thought Smith
was such a beast of a moniker.

173
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,758
Try doing anything remarkable
with that.

174
00:08:52,838 --> 00:08:54,717
And heredity is such a burden.

175
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:56,358
If I made the name Jakes
worthwhile,

176
00:08:56,438 --> 00:08:58,437
people would think it was
because of my grandfather.

177
00:08:58,477 --> 00:09:00,116
Who knows what you three
might achieve?

178
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:02,235
You ought to try to do something
for your country.

179
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:06,434
Fossil would look splendid
in the history books.

180
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:11,352
What do you think
she meant by "history books"?

181
00:09:11,432 --> 00:09:12,593
I'm not sure.

182
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:16,391
I suppose they meant giving some
sort of service to our country.

183
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:18,150
We ought to make a vow.

184
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,870
A vow?

185
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,389
To our country?

186
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,388
A promise... to ourselves.

187
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:27,348
Like this.

188
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,947
Put your hands on mine.

189
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:37,985
We three Fossils vow to put
our name in the history books

190
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:40,504
because it is uniquely ours
and ours alone,

191
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:44,023
and no one can say it's because
of our grandfathers.

192
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,663
We vow.

193
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:49,781
We vow.

194
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:52,060
We vow.

195
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,101
Posy!

196
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:55,060
Ow!

197
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,819
What's that?

198
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:05,576
I shall be out every day
from 8:00 till 7:30.

199
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:09,336
I bathe three times a week,
and I never eat breakfast.

200
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,774
Oh.
Strong floor.

201
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:15,014
Was this a ballroom?

202
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:17,653
Not while I've been living here.

203
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,611
Do you like to dance, too, dear?

204
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,049
Perfect.

205
00:10:32,168 --> 00:10:34,328
Come on.
The more, the merrier.

206
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:35,488
Tango!

207
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:44,245
Come here, little one.

208
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:46,484
Come on.
It's going to be fine.

209
00:10:48,403 --> 00:10:49,923
Whee!

210
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,998
Well, Miss Brown, I will take
this room on one condition.

211
00:11:07,638 --> 00:11:09,797
Oh, please.
Just let them audition.

212
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,797
I've been on the staff
of the academy for years,

213
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:13,476
and I cannot recommend
the place enough.

214
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:15,396
I can't afford the fees,
Miss Dane.

215
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:17,555
Madam Fidolia is a refugee
from Russia.

216
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,314
The Revolution completely did it
for her.

217
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:20,994
She'd been such a favorite
of the czar.

218
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:23,634
She has a history of taking on
girls from impoverished homes.

219
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:24,833
She trains them for nothing

220
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:27,152
and then takes 10% of
their earnings when they work.

221
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:28,472
They'd be sent out to work?

222
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:30,431
As soon as they're old enough
to have a license.

223
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,671
But I don't want the children
going on the stage.

224
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:35,030
And I'm quite sure
that Nana doesn't either.

225
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:37,989
Whilst I don't care
for Miss Dane

226
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:39,949
casting aspersions on this home,

227
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:41,908
you might say that Posy's
bound to dance anyway

228
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:44,827
given that she came with
her own little ballet slippers.

229
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:47,547
Pauline does nothing
but look in mirrors and recite.

230
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:48,746
And as for Petrova,

231
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:51,505
all she thinks about
is aeroplanes and engine parts.

232
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,744
Been trying to turn her into
a lady for the past 10 years

233
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:55,463
and got nowhere.

234
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:57,743
-So if this Madam Folderoll...
-Fidolia.

235
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,822
...proves willing to try,
I would let her.

236
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,981
Miss Brown,
we request a consultation.

237
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:07,420
Now?

238
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,019
Um, the fact of the matter is,
my dear, we very much doubt

239
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:15,218
whether you're qualified
to teach those children.

240
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:17,777
But I'm very well grounded
in natural science,

241
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,177
and I've got
my school certificate.

242
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:22,256
I did consider the school
at the top of the road, but...

243
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:24,575
You can't send them there.
They'll get lice.

244
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:25,934
My opinion entirely.

245
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:27,054
Frightful accents.

246
00:12:27,134 --> 00:12:29,974
Which wouldn't help their
chances in the theater at all.

247
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:34,452
My dear, life can be
a surprising affair,

248
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:36,852
as Dr. Smith and I found out.

249
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:39,051
We both felt
that we should retire

250
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,690
but find that we are unsuited
to a life of idleness.

251
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,329
And more to the point,
we miss our teaching.

252
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:48,048
We should very much like
to coach the girls.

253
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:49,687
All-'round education,

254
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,806
specializing in mathematics
and literature.

255
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:54,526
The children will be prepared
to take their school certificate

256
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,166
and matriculation.

257
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:59,604
No charge. Ours to suit.
What do you think?

258
00:13:03,004 --> 00:13:04,563
I don't know what to think.

259
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:06,962
Do you want your charges
educated?

260
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:09,362
And do you want them trained
to earn a living?

261
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,639
I want both.

262
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,918
The world isn't kind to girls
who can't support themselves.

263
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:27,077
Careful!

264
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:28,756
Come on!

265
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:33,674
Tsk.
Bare legs in the street.

266
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,712
Do they look smart, Nana?

267
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:44,631
No, but they look neat.

268
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:49,109
Petrova, will you
at least try and smile?

269
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:51,669
I swear the face on that child
would stop a clock.

270
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:56,427
And shuffle, shuffle,
hop, step, tap...

271
00:13:56,507 --> 00:13:58,707
There it is.

272
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:00,826
And up, Muriel!

273
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,585
Should we knock, do you suppose?

274
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:14,822
Posy.

275
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:17,581
It's so gloomy.

276
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:21,540
Ah.

277
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,700
The Fossil sisters.

278
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:29,138
How do you do?
I'm Pauline.

279
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:30,617
No.

280
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:32,897
All my pupils,
morning and night,

281
00:14:32,977 --> 00:14:35,816
before or after class,
whenever we meet,

282
00:14:35,896 --> 00:14:40,175
they say "Madame" and curtsy.

283
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,414
So...

284
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,212
Madame.

285
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:52,571
Which is Petrova?

286
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:00,368
-Me.
-You are Russian.

287
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:02,647
Yes.

288
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,768
You speak Russian?

289
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:09,446
But you feel Russian?

290
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:13,765
Actually, she's always said
she couldn't feel more British.

291
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:20,683
You are the first compatriot
of mine to come to my academy.

292
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:25,001
I will make wonderful artist
of you.

293
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,199
You must be Posy.

294
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,719
Madame.

295
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:38,997
5, 6, 7, 8!

296
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,793
And smile!
Smile!

297
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,472
You don't see Shirley Temple
with a gloomy face!

298
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:10,588
<i>Moment.</i>

299
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:12,627
-Madame.
-Madame.

300
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:21,104
To center, if you please.

301
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,663
I think polka, Mrs. Davis.

302
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,459
"Stockinette vests, buff.
Two each.

303
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,538
Royal blue cotton rompers.
Two each.

304
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:43,938
White tarlatan ballet dresses.
Two each.

305
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:47,656
White knickers, all frills.
Two each.

306
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:51,016
Two black sateen
elocution overalls per child."

307
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:53,335
How are we going to
make it all by Monday?

308
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:55,134
I don't care
if we have to sew all night.

309
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,933
This is the biggest chance
these girls have ever had.

310
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:02,772
# <i>Life is just</i>
<i>a bowl of cherries</i> #

311
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:05,971
# <i>So live and laugh at it all</i> #

312
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,291
All the way up
to her darling derriere.

313
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,130
# <i>Laugh at it all</i> #

314
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,809
There's no point making me
into a wonderful artiste.

315
00:17:12,889 --> 00:17:15,528
I already know
what I really want to be.

316
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,248
Racing driver?

317
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,047
I want to fly planes,
like Amy Johnson.

318
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:21,286
Very laudable ambition.

319
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:23,045
It's not because
she's fashionable

320
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,886
and in all the magazines.

321
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:26,845
It's not even
because I love engines.

322
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:31,524
It's... the idea that
there are roads in the sky,

323
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:34,922
ways 'round the world
that no one has discovered.

324
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:37,921
Roads in the sky.

325
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:40,841
And until I can do that,
I'd like to work with cars.

326
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,000
Well, that's good.

327
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,879
'Cause I've just bought
a garage.

328
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:46,838
A garage?

329
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:49,358
It's gonna be tough going
for the first few months.

330
00:17:49,438 --> 00:17:52,037
I might need some help
from time to time.

331
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:57,076
All right.

332
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:10,032
When you said
you were going to make a drink,

333
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:11,431
I thought you meant
a cup of cocoa.

334
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:13,391
Oh, be a sport.

335
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:16,230
Look, I've even got a jar
of maraschino cherries.

336
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,829
I absolutely promise
not to get you tight.

337
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:21,829
This is the way they used to
mix them at the Ritz

338
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,387
when I was in
"Miss Rosebud's Bouncing Babes."

339
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:26,507
You drank cocktails
when you were a bouncing babe?

340
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:27,906
Oh, I was practically 19.

341
00:18:27,986 --> 00:18:30,866
Miss Rosebud had to bind
my bosoms flat.

342
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:34,224
Otherwise they bounced rather
more than was approved of.

343
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:40,863
Chin-chin.

344
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:43,461
The girls will be happy,
won't they?

345
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,381
Oh, my darling.
You don't even need to ask.

346
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:52,019
# <i>It's just the time</i>
<i>for dancing</i> #

347
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:56,578
# <i>Tomorrow is your day</i> #

348
00:18:56,658 --> 00:19:00,736
# <i>Go where the music's calling</i> #

349
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:04,935
# <i>And dance the blues away</i> #

350
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:12,453
# <i>And all you need to ask for</i>
<i>is just one dance more</i> #

351
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,124
Hurry up, Pauline!

352
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:44,204
You'll have to hang on!

353
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:52,561
Need a hand?

354
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,320
Oh, you are kind.

355
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,119
But they won't take long.

356
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:09,596
You know, when I was at school,
shoe-cleaning was a punishment.

357
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:14,154
Matron would say, "Clean them
till they shine like mirrors.

358
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:17,634
Give you time to reflect
on your misdeeds."

359
00:20:17,714 --> 00:20:20,912
There was a fire in that room.
I always quite enjoyed it.

360
00:20:20,992 --> 00:20:23,832
Well, Mr. Simpson.
You are a gentleman.

361
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:25,152
Let's leave that to me.

362
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:27,551
There's a bit of a knack
with tap shoes.

363
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:33,189
I'll, uh, I-I'll...
I'll let you get on, then.

364
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,189
Thank you.

365
00:20:38,627 --> 00:20:39,827
Do you know sometimes I think

366
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,987
heaven sent those lodgers
to this house?

367
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:44,306
Not a moment too soon,
if you ask me.

368
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:47,024
We really need to get
that wiring mended.

369
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:50,424
And you're looking very thin.

370
00:20:50,504 --> 00:20:52,263
I've always been thin.

371
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:54,142
And you're going gray.

372
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:55,582
I am not.

373
00:20:56,782 --> 00:20:58,582
I just got the odd silver hair.

374
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,380
I'm starting to rehearse
my m'audition in a week.

375
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,019
What is a m'audition, anyway?

376
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,818
It's what you have to have
to show your managers.

377
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:10,018
It means "my audition."

378
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:13,537
But over the years,
it's run into one out of habit.

379
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:16,136
Typical academy.

380
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:18,415
Always got to be a special word
for everything.

381
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:21,215
Anyone who goes out
for any audition anywhere

382
00:21:21,255 --> 00:21:22,694
has to sing, dance, and recite.

383
00:21:22,774 --> 00:21:24,254
Doesn't matter
which school you train at.

384
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:26,013
It's what you have to do.

385
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:28,292
I'm dreading my next birthday.

386
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:32,091
I'll have to get a license
and tap-dance on the stage.

387
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:33,731
I don't want to tap-dance
either.

388
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,130
But I think I'd like to act.

389
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:42,528
How long will it be
till these fit?

390
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:20,797
Another hole
in my elocution drawers.

391
00:22:20,877 --> 00:22:22,476
It's massive.

392
00:22:22,556 --> 00:22:23,836
Right.

393
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,875
Today's French acting class
is canceled.

394
00:22:26,955 --> 00:22:29,594
Anyone involved in the choral
speaking championships,

395
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:31,833
please go and wait
in studio one.

396
00:22:31,913 --> 00:22:33,313
Posy Fossil?

397
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,113
Madame would like a word.

398
00:22:35,193 --> 00:22:36,792
Winifred Bagnall
and Pauline Fossil,

399
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:38,951
stay here and speak to me.

400
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:41,110
You better not be in bother.

401
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,150
Petrova?

402
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,349
Haven't you got anywhere to go?

403
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:47,509
No, not now.

404
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:51,468
Well, dear, wait outside while
I have a word with these two.

405
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:53,467
Yes, Miss Jay.

406
00:22:58,425 --> 00:22:59,985
There's an audition tomorrow.

407
00:23:00,065 --> 00:23:01,505
The Princess Theatre.

408
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:05,903
You are both to be there
punctually at noon, and...

409
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,142
...I want you to style your hair
like this.

410
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,662
Is it for "Alice in Wonderland"?

411
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:12,661
Mm.

412
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:15,100
Girls going for Alice
always wear a ribbon.

413
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,100
Wish it wasn't the Princess,
though.

414
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,179
It's such a mean management.

415
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:21,818
One ought to get six,
but it's more likely four.

416
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:24,018
They might squeeze five.

417
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:26,657
Five what... shillings?

418
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:29,416
Pounds... per week.

419
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:32,296
Don't you need any money
at home?

420
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:35,614
You will attend
no further classes

421
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:38,053
with your sisters and Miss Dane.

422
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,853
You will no longer study
tap dancing.

423
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:42,173
You will no longer study
character dancing.

424
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:44,932
You will no longer study
singing, musical comedy,

425
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,491
or mime.

426
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:48,651
In future,

427
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:53,409
you will receive instruction
only in classical ballet.

428
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:57,528
And all that instruction
will come from me.

429
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:02,286
You are the first child
in the history of the academy

430
00:24:02,366 --> 00:24:06,725
to come entirely
under my personal supervision.

431
00:24:06,805 --> 00:24:13,004
You have the potential to be
a truly remarkable dancer.

432
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:15,843
As remarkable as you?

433
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:17,442
Oh, my child.

434
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,001
Much, much more remarkable
than me.

435
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,880
But, Sylvia.

436
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,519
She needs an attractive frock
with a full-flared skirt

437
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,759
in order to show off her dancing
to advantage.

438
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,438
Can't she just wear
a practice dress

439
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:33,157
or go in a jersey and skirt?

440
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:34,277
Oh, darling, are you mad?

441
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:36,036
She has to look quite perfectly
turned up.

442
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:37,996
Otherwise, she simply
will not stand a chance.

443
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:41,355
Pauline, performance
comes from within.

444
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:42,874
When I watch you reciting Puck,

445
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:45,313
I don't see
Pauline Fossil, schoolgirl.

446
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:48,993
I see a queer, mercurial
woodland creature.

447
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:50,232
In a jersey and skirt.

448
00:24:50,312 --> 00:24:51,472
Irena, that is unhelpful.

449
00:24:51,552 --> 00:24:53,511
I still don't see what's wrong
with cotton.

450
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:55,511
From the summer before last!

451
00:24:55,591 --> 00:24:56,790
She's outgrowing them all.

452
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,230
'Round the bust.

453
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,709
-Shut up, Posy!
-Be quiet, Posy.

454
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,829
Less of the bust chat,
thank you.

455
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:03,908
Oh, I'll be quiet.

456
00:25:03,988 --> 00:25:06,427
But not until I've said
that I think it's very unfair

457
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,906
that in the middle of all
this fuss about Pauline's frock

458
00:25:08,946 --> 00:25:11,466
and Pauline's audition,
not one person has said

459
00:25:11,546 --> 00:25:13,345
they're pleased
about Madame's plans for me!

460
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:16,264
I can't go looking like this.

461
00:25:16,344 --> 00:25:18,063
Posy, that's an absolutely...

462
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,300
They have a flap on?

463
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,858
It's a flap about money.

464
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:40,697
And Garnie says we shouldn't
discuss that sort of thing.

465
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:41,896
Easily done...

466
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:44,856
...when there's plenty about.

467
00:25:48,175 --> 00:25:49,494
Have you ever been poor?

468
00:25:58,012 --> 00:25:59,572
Dreadfully poor.

469
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:05,769
Have you ever been in...
in a pawnshop?

470
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:09,249
More than once
by the time I was your age.

471
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:11,408
There's one just off
Earl's Court Road.

472
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:13,287
Nana says people
borrow money there

473
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:15,887
in exchange for items of value.

474
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:20,725
She said it's a facility
for the desperate.

475
00:26:23,324 --> 00:26:25,324
Are you desperate?

476
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:27,803
Are things really so bad?

477
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,642
We do have items of value.

478
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:37,800
What I propose is this.

479
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,199
I will personally advance you
the sum of £ 4 and 10 shillings

480
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,078
in exchange for custody
of the necklaces.

481
00:26:45,158 --> 00:26:47,317
And Garnie will not be told
of this arrangement.

482
00:26:47,877 --> 00:26:50,636
And if she asks any questions,
I shall say I've had a windfall.

483
00:26:50,716 --> 00:26:51,916
I'll sign.

484
00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:55,434
Pauline will then use
the advance

485
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:58,634
to purchase
an appropriate audition frock

486
00:26:58,714 --> 00:27:02,193
and will then buy the necklaces
back in small installments,

487
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,992
always provided
she gets the part.

488
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:06,232
No matter how long
the process takes,

489
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:08,271
no interest will be charged.

490
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:19,147
# You can't escape #

491
00:27:19,227 --> 00:27:22,867
# It's in your memory #

492
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:28,504
# By morning, night, and noon #

493
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:30,585
# She will leave you #

494
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:35,303
# And then come back again #

495
00:27:35,383 --> 00:27:40,062
# A pretty girl
is just like a pretty tune #

496
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:47,260
She's very good.

497
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:50,818
She's the best all-'round
student the academy's ever had.

498
00:28:12,852 --> 00:28:15,371
I have a hole underneath
the right arm on my frock.

499
00:28:15,411 --> 00:28:17,570
I had to change my position
for the attitude at the end.

500
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,290
Little fair girl in black.
What's your name?

501
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:26,167
Pauline Fossil.

502
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:27,767
Come down to center stage.

503
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:37,484
Would you like to sing first,
or would you like to recite?

504
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,123
I'll recite.

505
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:44,842
Puck,
"A Midsummer's Night Dream."

506
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,398
I am that merry wanderer
of the night.

507
00:28:56,478 --> 00:28:59,998
I jest to Oberon
and make him smile.

508
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:02,277
When I a fat
and bean-fed horse beguile,

509
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:04,516
neighing in likeness
of a filly foal.

510
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,915
Sometimes lurk I
in a gossip's bowl,

511
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,474
in very likeness
of a roasted crab.

512
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:15,953
And when she drinks,
against her lips I bob,

513
00:29:15,993 --> 00:29:19,632
and on her withered dewlaps
pours the ale.

514
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:28,149
Will all playing cards, dormice,
and dancing frog footmen

515
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:30,268
make your way
directly to the stage?

516
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:33,508
Any mock turtles,
wait in the wings till called.

517
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,786
Well done.
Well done, both of you.

518
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:41,425
Now, Pauline is to play Alice.

519
00:29:42,705 --> 00:29:45,264
And Winifred will be engaged
as understudy.

520
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,503
When I finished my dance,
people clapped.

521
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:51,222
Nobody clapped her!
There was just silence!

522
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:55,141
Dance is important, but Pauline
looks right for Alice.

523
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:57,341
She looks right for everything!

524
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,180
She always will.

525
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,419
Pretty face.

526
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:04,418
Blond hair.

527
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:07,378
It's got nothing whatsoever
to do with talent,

528
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,177
and it's so unfair!

529
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:11,416
Winifred!
Winifred!

530
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:12,655
Winifred!

531
00:30:12,695 --> 00:30:15,975
I will not take housekeeping
money from you, Pauline.

532
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:18,494
What would the authorities
think of me, making a...

533
00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:20,733
Thank you.

534
00:30:20,773 --> 00:30:22,413
Making a profit from an orphan?

535
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:28,851
Besides, the law states
that a working child must save.

536
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,651
Only one-third of her earnings.

537
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:31,810
One-third of £ 4

538
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,170
is 26 shillings and 8 pence.

539
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,369
Even after 8 shillings
has gone to the academy,

540
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:37,288
that would leave £2,
5 shillings, and 4 pence

541
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,408
for the house.

542
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:41,487
There's no need
to blind me with accountancy.

543
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:48,645
Garnie, we know we're poor.

544
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:51,204
I don't know how they found out.

545
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:53,323
Listening at doors, I don't
doubt... naughty, sneaky habit.

546
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:56,003
I'm assuming
this is Mr. Simpson's.

547
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,762
And if you'll excuse my saying,

548
00:30:57,842 --> 00:30:59,801
I think you ought to take
what Pauline's offered.

549
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:02,001
I wanted Pauline to save
for the future.

550
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:04,481
All kinds of things might happen
in the future.

551
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,440
The professor might come back...
in the future.

552
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:10,278
Your health might come back
on its own... in the future.

553
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:12,198
You inherited that chest
from your father.

554
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:14,077
Think of what happened to him.

555
00:31:17,516 --> 00:31:19,756
She'll accept
30 shillings a week.

556
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,635
Now, off upstairs,
the lot of you!

557
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:23,794
Or you'll be feeling
the back of my hairbrush!

558
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:32,912
Sylvia, what matters most
is the life the girls have now.

559
00:31:32,952 --> 00:31:35,431
And it wouldn't amount to much
if it didn't have you in it.

560
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:37,391
Now there's money coming in,
there's things you can see to.

561
00:31:37,471 --> 00:31:39,310
You can go see a specialist,
for a start.

562
00:31:41,989 --> 00:31:43,549
Petrova.

563
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:46,028
Petrova.

564
00:31:51,547 --> 00:31:53,186
Do you think I can do it?

565
00:31:55,505 --> 00:31:58,064
Do what?

566
00:31:58,144 --> 00:32:00,104
Play Alice.

567
00:32:02,183 --> 00:32:04,942
Winifred was better than me
at the audition.

568
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:08,701
And it's a massive part.

569
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:12,620
You can't lose your nerve.

570
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,739
We need the money.

571
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:03,165
Stop!

572
00:33:06,764 --> 00:33:09,003
You're nothing
but a pack of playing cards!

573
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,522
Well done!

574
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:13,522
Bravo!

575
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:46,912
We'll see you back at home.

576
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:48,991
You're wearing the necklaces.

577
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:51,070
Mr. Simpson brought them down.

578
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,269
He didn't want Garnie
to be suspicious.

579
00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:55,150
Well done.
Very good.

580
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:57,629
What did you really think?

581
00:33:57,709 --> 00:33:59,188
-You were marvelous.
-Did you see us?

582
00:33:59,228 --> 00:34:00,747
Get that on your way out,

583
00:34:00,827 --> 00:34:02,428
would you, Winifred?

584
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,547
I'll see to it.

585
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:06,746
Let's button up that gabardine.

586
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:13,104
I see Pauline left her wrap
in the wings again.

587
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,663
Could you remind her to wear it
over her costume at all times

588
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:17,462
unless she's actually
on the stage?

589
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:20,022
Most certainly.
She knows the rules.

590
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:22,701
Ahem.

591
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:30,659
Miss Brown?

592
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:39,176
She's worn out
with all the excitement.

593
00:34:39,256 --> 00:34:41,135
Should we, uh, let her sleep?

594
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,129
Shh.

595
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:05,128
Well done.

596
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:08,288
I'm not a complete novice.

597
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:22,643
What happened
to your wife and child?

598
00:35:26,682 --> 00:35:28,441
There was a...

599
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:30,121
a typhoid epidemic.

600
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:32,481
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

601
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:33,800
No.

602
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,878
I sometimes feel that
I'd like to talk about it.

603
00:35:43,397 --> 00:35:45,156
Then I find it's better
if I don't.

604
00:35:50,035 --> 00:35:52,394
-Good night.
-Good night.

605
00:35:56,792 --> 00:35:59,872
They've announced a month
of extra matinees.

606
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:01,551
And next week,
Princess Elizabeth

607
00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:03,631
and Princess Margaret Rose
are coming.

608
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:05,150
And will they be calling for tea

609
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,790
in your dressing room
afterwards?

610
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,789
Oh, I hope not.
I'm always so tired after shows.

611
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:13,908
Posy, would you run downstairs
and fetch my handkerchief?

612
00:36:13,988 --> 00:36:15,707
No, I will not.

613
00:36:15,747 --> 00:36:17,787
Is something the matter
with your arms and legs?

614
00:36:17,867 --> 00:36:20,985
No.
I just need to save my strength.

615
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:22,666
It's going to be
awfully difficult

616
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:24,825
when we're all working,
isn't it, Petrova?

617
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:25,864
Yes.

618
00:36:25,944 --> 00:36:27,703
All of us
giving out orders at once.

619
00:36:27,783 --> 00:36:28,703
Mm-hmm.

620
00:36:28,783 --> 00:36:31,743
I think you're both being
absolutely vile.

621
00:36:32,822 --> 00:36:34,422
Ooh, door-slamming.

622
00:36:34,502 --> 00:36:37,021
That's a new one.

623
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,181
And where do you think
you're going?

624
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:45,418
Wretched bills.

625
00:37:25,086 --> 00:37:26,806
-Harley Street, please.
-Okay.

626
00:37:39,002 --> 00:37:41,082
Bravo!

627
00:37:41,162 --> 00:37:43,561
Jolly well done!
Bravo!

628
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:44,921
Thanks for the good show!

629
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:46,320
Three curtain calls again.

630
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,880
Compliments of Mr. French,

631
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,839
but would Miss Fossil go back
for her wrap?

632
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:51,358
You will keep leaving it
in the wings.

633
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,439
Let Winifred get it!

634
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,798
It's the least she can do,

635
00:37:53,878 --> 00:37:55,358
sitting in my dressing room
night after night!

636
00:37:55,437 --> 00:37:57,197
If everybody had their right,
it would be you sitting

637
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:58,756
in Winifred's dressing room
night after night!

638
00:37:58,836 --> 00:38:01,156
-How can you even say that?!
-I can say that because...

639
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,315
What is this
appalling commotion?

640
00:38:03,355 --> 00:38:05,754
As you know, sir, Pauline left
her wrap in the wings again.

641
00:38:05,794 --> 00:38:07,793
I have reprimanded her,
but she will not fetch it.

642
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,074
Fetch it yourselves
if you want it fetched!

643
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:10,713
-Pauline!
-That is enough.

644
00:38:10,793 --> 00:38:13,992
Rules are not made
for little girls to break.

645
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:16,552
What's your name again...
um, Winifred...

646
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:18,351
Winifred Bagnall, sir.

647
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:20,710
-I'm Pauline's understudy.
-Yes.

648
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,469
Well, I think it's high time
your positions were reversed.

649
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:26,628
From tomorrow, Winifred
will pay the part of Alice.

650
00:38:32,386 --> 00:38:35,426
Pauline, will you
please tell me what's happened?

651
00:38:35,506 --> 00:38:37,065
Can't you just mind
your own business?

652
00:38:37,145 --> 00:38:39,064
Garnie's been
to see a specialist.

653
00:38:39,144 --> 00:38:40,984
He asked to see her again.

654
00:38:41,064 --> 00:38:43,143
I found a letter all about it.

655
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,622
I know we shouldn't snoop.

656
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:48,141
But they never tell us anything!

657
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:52,421
I-It said... she's got...

658
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,020
inflammation of the lungs,

659
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,059
t-that she should move
to a milder climate.

660
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:00,578
But you're working now,

661
00:39:00,658 --> 00:39:02,857
and the extra matinees
are just about to start.

662
00:39:02,897 --> 00:39:05,497
We could send her to Bournemouth
or Brighton.

663
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,975
Can't we?

664
00:39:13,014 --> 00:39:15,574
I was so selfish.

665
00:39:16,893 --> 00:39:19,772
All I could think about
was proving myself,

666
00:39:19,812 --> 00:39:22,372
making everyone see
that I was talented.

667
00:39:22,452 --> 00:39:24,451
But you <i>are</i> talented.

668
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,090
I have to be.

669
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,449
You have to be.
Posy has to be.

670
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:32,249
Posy is.

671
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:36,407
Don't you ever worry

672
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:39,607
that all the three of has
is each other...

673
00:39:39,687 --> 00:39:42,445
what we are, what we can do...

674
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:45,164
our talents?

675
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:46,845
No.

676
00:39:48,404 --> 00:39:50,283
Don't you think it's true?

677
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:52,962
I daren't think it's true.

678
00:40:19,595 --> 00:40:20,914
Epaulement, child.

679
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:23,233
When the right leg
is extended behind,

680
00:40:23,313 --> 00:40:26,152
the left shoulder
must move back.

681
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,390
1, 2, 3, 4.

682
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,829
Pas de bourrée.

683
00:40:49,985 --> 00:40:52,265
Reach, child.

684
00:40:52,345 --> 00:40:54,024
Reach.

685
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:04,021
Petrova!

686
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:05,580
Coming.

687
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:14,778
We three Fossils vow to put
our names in the history books

688
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:17,417
because it is uniquely ours
and ours alone,

689
00:41:17,497 --> 00:41:20,136
and no one can say it's because
of our grandfathers.

690
00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:23,415
We also vow to earn some money
to help Garnie

691
00:41:23,495 --> 00:41:26,095
and support ourselves
until Gum comes home.

692
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:28,294
Amen.

693
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:29,493
Amen?

694
00:41:29,813 --> 00:41:32,132
Amen?
We aren't in church.

695
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:34,412
We do the vow every birthday
and every Christmas,

696
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,332
and we've never said
"amen" ever.

697
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:38,411
I haven't had any work
since "Alice."

698
00:41:38,491 --> 00:41:41,690
We need help, and I don't care
where it comes from.

699
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,649
Well, it looks like amen, then.

700
00:41:43,729 --> 00:41:44,649
Amen.

701
00:41:44,729 --> 00:41:46,008
Yes, amen.

702
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:49,007
Come on, Petrova!

703
00:41:57,205 --> 00:41:58,925
Give me your worst!

704
00:41:59,005 --> 00:42:01,524
Oh, well done!

705
00:42:02,483 --> 00:42:03,643
Come on, girls.

706
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:06,203
Mind yourself with that bat.
We don't want any broken teeth.

707
00:42:06,283 --> 00:42:08,322
I was cricket captain.

708
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,521
My sport was lacrosse.

709
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,400
Oh, come on.
Give us another shot.

710
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,959
She'll be thrilled!

711
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,239
Oh, for heaven's sake!

712
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,198
But you've already given her
a sovereign.

713
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:21,717
And I could have made
a cake myself.

714
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:23,678
You do more than enough already.

715
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:26,596
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

716
00:42:29,155 --> 00:42:32,235
How old would he be now...
your son?

717
00:42:34,114 --> 00:42:38,633
He'd be getting on for, uh... 11.

718
00:42:42,672 --> 00:42:44,311
Come on, birthday girl.

719
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,429
Oh, Sylvia!

720
00:42:51,909 --> 00:42:54,508
Oh, Sylvia!
Thank the Lord I found you!

721
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:56,708
There's an audition. " Midsummer
Night's Dream, " West End.

722
00:42:56,788 --> 00:42:58,227
Directed by Sir Donald Houghton.

723
00:42:58,307 --> 00:42:59,387
They want to see Pauline
and Petrova

724
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:01,146
tomorrow morning at 10:00!

725
00:43:01,226 --> 00:43:03,386
Oh!

726
00:43:03,466 --> 00:43:04,905
Shakespeare?

727
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:06,265
Oh, dear.

728
00:43:06,305 --> 00:43:09,463
Petrova and the iambic
pentameter are not soul mates.

729
00:43:10,663 --> 00:43:12,423
It's no good.

730
00:43:12,943 --> 00:43:14,022
Won't fit either of you.

731
00:43:14,102 --> 00:43:15,662
You've gone the same way
as your sister.

732
00:43:15,742 --> 00:43:17,181
'Round the you-know-what.

733
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,261
That's enough from you.
Your turn will come.

734
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:22,220
We need a new dress each.

735
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,179
It'll look good
if we're dressed the same.

736
00:43:24,259 --> 00:43:25,539
And Nana can make them both.

737
00:43:25,618 --> 00:43:28,018
Oh, out of what, might I ask...
Scotch mist?

738
00:43:28,098 --> 00:43:29,738
There's no money, Pauline.

739
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:32,457
How much does a piece
of material cost?

740
00:43:32,537 --> 00:43:35,016
More than we've got.
That's how much.

741
00:43:35,096 --> 00:43:37,016
Then we just can't go.

742
00:43:37,096 --> 00:43:38,535
We have to go.

743
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:40,654
We have to get these jobs.

744
00:43:41,854 --> 00:43:45,293
I suppose there's always
my birthday sovereign.

745
00:43:52,691 --> 00:43:54,930
We needn't have bothered.
I look awful anyway.

746
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,130
It's only a sty.

747
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,809
When we take the patch off,
the borax will have worked.

748
00:43:58,888 --> 00:44:01,049
There won't even be
a suggestion of a swelling.

749
00:44:01,129 --> 00:44:04,927
Little dark girl
with the red eye.

750
00:44:05,007 --> 00:44:06,726
What's your name?

751
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:08,926
Petrova Fossil.

752
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:10,845
What part have you come
to try for?

753
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:12,525
Mustardseed.

754
00:44:15,963 --> 00:44:17,724
Oh.

755
00:44:17,804 --> 00:44:21,202
Come down to the front
of the stage, please.

756
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,639
Whenever you're ready.

757
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:34,718
Do you want me to sing
or recite?

758
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:36,598
There's no need to sing.

759
00:44:36,638 --> 00:44:38,397
This isn't a musical.

760
00:44:42,276 --> 00:44:46,514
"Henry V," Act 3, Scene 2.
The Boy.

761
00:44:46,594 --> 00:44:49,113
Oh.
Isn't that prose?

762
00:44:50,074 --> 00:44:51,074
Yes.

763
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:52,633
Very well.

764
00:44:52,713 --> 00:44:54,672
Go on.

765
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:00,990
"As young as I am."

766
00:45:03,189 --> 00:45:05,269
As young as I am,

767
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:09,948
I-I have observed
these three swashers.

768
00:45:10,028 --> 00:45:11,947
I am but boy to them
all three...

769
00:45:12,027 --> 00:45:13,466
Thank you.
That's enough.

770
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:14,267
No.

771
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:16,466
Please.
You must let her finish.

772
00:45:16,546 --> 00:45:19,784
I said that's enough
because I had heard enough.

773
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:21,384
She has got the part.

774
00:45:22,384 --> 00:45:26,383
She has a decent accent, and we
must cast these parts today.

775
00:45:26,463 --> 00:45:30,422
And, um, there are no other
candidates for Mustardseed.

776
00:45:30,502 --> 00:45:31,901
No, sir.

777
00:45:31,941 --> 00:45:32,941
Pauline?

778
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,579
Mr. French.

779
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:38,419
I take it she's your sister.

780
00:45:38,499 --> 00:45:39,739
Yes.

781
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:42,538
We won't bother hearing you.
You can both go.

782
00:45:42,578 --> 00:45:43,977
You're hired.

783
00:45:44,017 --> 00:45:46,696
Run along and fetch your coats
before I change my mind.

784
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:47,697
Thank you.

785
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:48,736
Thank you.

786
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,494
We got them!

787
00:45:53,574 --> 00:45:55,055
We got them, we got them!

788
00:45:55,095 --> 00:45:56,734
Are we too late?!

789
00:45:56,814 --> 00:45:59,453
We've been to Eastbourne
to Father's sanatorium.

790
00:46:00,013 --> 00:46:01,492
I didn't get the message
till today.

791
00:46:01,572 --> 00:46:04,412
I was being seen
for Mustardseed.

792
00:46:04,492 --> 00:46:05,491
They cast me.

793
00:46:05,571 --> 00:46:08,610
T-They thought nobody else
was coming.

794
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:11,129
You could try
for the ballet of the fairies

795
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:12,249
after lunch.

796
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:13,849
Couldn't get into a ballet
of goblins

797
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:16,048
looking the way I do today.

798
00:46:16,128 --> 00:46:18,767
My dress has gone underneath
the other arm.

799
00:46:18,807 --> 00:46:22,006
You can borrow my frock
or Pauline's.

800
00:46:22,086 --> 00:46:23,326
Can't she?

801
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:24,325
Mm.

802
00:46:25,845 --> 00:46:27,244
The trouble with you, Petrova,

803
00:46:27,324 --> 00:46:29,204
is that you're a martyr
to your conscience.

804
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:32,043
The trouble with you is
that you haven't got one.

805
00:46:32,683 --> 00:46:36,122
Look. This is Winifred
in the ballet of the fairies.

806
00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:40,480
I'm the best all-'round student
this academy's ever had.

807
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,839
Even though I've got
a, frankly, enormous bottom,

808
00:46:42,919 --> 00:46:44,960
I'm going to spend most of Act 2
behind a tree.

809
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,478
Posy Fossil,
you are a heartless monster.

810
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:50,557
You noticed.

811
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:54,637
I brought you up.
I notice everything.

812
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:58,515
Right,
we'll start with Cue 19-A,

813
00:46:58,595 --> 00:47:01,115
which is Oberon's line,

814
00:47:01,195 --> 00:47:05,513
"I am invisible, and I will
overhear their conference."

815
00:47:10,712 --> 00:47:12,791
Pauline!

816
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:16,589
Bravo!

817
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,749
Do you still hate
the idea of working?

818
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:21,788
Well, I always wanted to fly.

819
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:28,746
And I will purge
thy mortal grossness

820
00:47:28,786 --> 00:47:32,744
so that thou shalt like
an airy spirit go.

821
00:47:32,824 --> 00:47:36,424
Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth,
and Mustardseed.

822
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,023
Ready.

823
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,822
And I.

824
00:47:42,422 --> 00:47:43,862
And I.

825
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:50,980
And I.

826
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:53,339
Give me the line again.

827
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,417
And I.

828
00:47:56,497 --> 00:47:58,218
Again.

829
00:48:02,936 --> 00:48:03,855
And I?

830
00:48:03,935 --> 00:48:07,455
Oh, please.
Am I asking for the moon?

831
00:48:07,535 --> 00:48:09,174
All I want you to give me

832
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:14,453
are two sharp,
clearly differentiated notes.

833
00:48:16,372 --> 00:48:19,491
As soon as you would care
to do so.

834
00:48:25,129 --> 00:48:26,609
A-And I.

835
00:48:31,768 --> 00:48:33,447
This is not the moment
to be funny.

836
00:48:34,367 --> 00:48:36,885
I'm afraid I have no further
time to waste on you.

837
00:48:37,925 --> 00:48:42,804
If your work does not improve,
I shall take the part away.

838
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:53,640
Petrova?

839
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,560
What ever's happened?

840
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,199
I'm going to get the sack.

841
00:48:59,279 --> 00:49:01,038
I'll practice with you.
The doctors will help.

842
00:49:01,118 --> 00:49:02,678
I'll still get the sack.

843
00:49:02,758 --> 00:49:05,118
Darling, there is nothing
in this world

844
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:06,837
worth getting so upset about.

845
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:09,156
Yes, there is!
You're ill.

846
00:49:09,236 --> 00:49:11,596
You need a rest
and a holiday and...

847
00:49:17,393 --> 00:49:19,313
You need a rest and a holiday,

848
00:49:19,393 --> 00:49:21,393
and you can't have one
if I get the sack.

849
00:49:21,433 --> 00:49:23,992
I don't know where on earth
you got such a silly idea.

850
00:49:24,072 --> 00:49:25,591
I can assure you,
Petrova Fossil,

851
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,951
that there is nothing whatever
the matter with my health.

852
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,270
Do you hear me?

853
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:30,830
I'm not having you upset
like this.

854
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:32,869
I'm going to see Donald
and giving him your notice.

855
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:34,948
-No!
-Don't.

856
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:39,507
I just feel so stupid
when I'm on the stage.

857
00:49:39,587 --> 00:49:41,306
What do you mean,
you feel stupid?

858
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:44,346
I mean I feel like myself.

859
00:49:51,023 --> 00:49:52,784
We have to help her.

860
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:57,901
So now I actually have to be
in character all the time...

861
00:49:57,981 --> 00:50:01,861
meals and lessons...
and everything.

862
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,899
There's a hole in the exhaust.

863
00:50:09,498 --> 00:50:12,457
The wardrobe mistress would
kill me if I get oil on this.

864
00:50:12,537 --> 00:50:13,497
Has it helped, though?

865
00:50:13,537 --> 00:50:16,655
Well, I don't feel human
anymore.

866
00:50:17,376 --> 00:50:19,335
I don't know how you stand it.

867
00:50:21,295 --> 00:50:23,654
I stand it
because we're saving up.

868
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:25,053
Garnie isn't well.

869
00:50:26,213 --> 00:50:27,653
She's got trouble
with her lungs.

870
00:50:29,892 --> 00:50:32,411
Pauline and I want her to have
a holiday.

871
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:35,171
She likes hotels
with tea and orchestras

872
00:50:35,251 --> 00:50:38,129
but will doubtless have to
settle for two weeks in a tent.

873
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:44,768
You're a very generous girl,
Petrova.

874
00:50:44,848 --> 00:50:46,207
Mustardseed.

875
00:50:46,287 --> 00:50:49,126
You're supposed to call me
Mustardseed.

876
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:53,205
So, when do you open...
Mustardseed?

877
00:50:53,285 --> 00:50:54,924
Tuesday.

878
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:59,164
Still, at least it will
all be over by Christmas.

879
00:51:31,874 --> 00:51:34,353
Thank God that's over.

880
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,431
Sir Donald's doing
"Richard III" next.

881
00:51:39,991 --> 00:51:42,590
He hasn't cast
the Princess in the Tower yet.

882
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:46,269
Do you think I should write to
him and ask him to audition us?

883
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:50,588
Don't even think of doing that
to me.

884
00:51:51,627 --> 00:51:53,467
I wouldn't be doing anything
to you.

885
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:56,506
We'd both be doing something
for poor Garnie.

886
00:51:56,586 --> 00:51:58,306
This has nothing to do
with Garnie.

887
00:51:58,386 --> 00:52:00,865
We've got enough money
for a holiday.

888
00:52:00,945 --> 00:52:04,344
This is all about you...
you and your acting.

889
00:52:04,384 --> 00:52:06,583
Do you think you're the only one
that knows their heart's desire?

890
00:52:06,663 --> 00:52:08,582
You're going to have to forget
your heart's desire.

891
00:52:08,622 --> 00:52:11,742
There aren't
any 14-year-old aviators.

892
00:52:12,222 --> 00:52:17,460
Pauline, you can make me sing,
and you can make me dance.

893
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,579
You can shove me out
onto a stage

894
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:22,898
and not care that I'm useless
and I'm hating it inside.

895
00:52:22,978 --> 00:52:25,777
I put up with it because
we have to earn our living.

896
00:52:25,857 --> 00:52:29,776
But if you keep pushing me,
then I will break.

897
00:52:41,373 --> 00:52:44,492
Theo, is everything all right?

898
00:52:44,572 --> 00:52:46,731
Just a minute!

899
00:52:46,811 --> 00:52:49,370
Nana can smell
something strange.

900
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:52,850
Oh. Must be my new perfume,
Coty Chypre.

901
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,009
Isn't it divine?

902
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:56,088
No, it's another stench
entirely...

903
00:52:56,168 --> 00:52:58,767
something more
like scorching dog.

904
00:53:00,207 --> 00:53:02,607
Oh, I'm sorry.

905
00:53:02,687 --> 00:53:04,526
It's me.

906
00:53:05,645 --> 00:53:07,964
I've been giving myself
a permanent wave.

907
00:53:09,525 --> 00:53:14,123
Nana, fetch soft soap and the
brandy from the medicine chest.

908
00:53:16,442 --> 00:53:19,202
It's stopped breaking off now.

909
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:22,600
It's just a bit... short.

910
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:27,959
Oh, Lord.

911
00:53:33,197 --> 00:53:35,917
Serves me right for trying
to turn the clock back.

912
00:53:35,997 --> 00:53:37,716
Why do you want to turn
the clock back?

913
00:53:37,796 --> 00:53:41,074
I've got to the point where
chaps have just stopped looking.

914
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:43,314
You know what it's like.

915
00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:47,473
One enters the room and makes
no more impression than a draft.

916
00:53:47,553 --> 00:53:48,752
I suppose so.

917
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:52,512
It was all so different
when I was young.

918
00:53:53,591 --> 00:53:58,310
I mean, there weren't many men
because of the beastly war.

919
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,829
Some of them
actually had bits missing.

920
00:54:02,548 --> 00:54:04,707
Those that were intact
were often rather mad.

921
00:54:04,787 --> 00:54:07,427
But they would wait for one
at the stage door

922
00:54:07,507 --> 00:54:10,626
or ask one out for drinks.

923
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:11,706
And when one appeared,

924
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:13,625
there'd be such a lightening
of their faces,

925
00:54:13,705 --> 00:54:17,664
as though they had
this surge of possibility and...

926
00:54:17,704 --> 00:54:20,503
I used to feel it, too.

927
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,582
Don't you anymore?

928
00:54:25,582 --> 00:54:27,061
I had to start telling myself

929
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:29,620
that there was no shame
in being an old maid.

930
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:36,058
Well, anyway.

931
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:39,938
The other day I had the first
tiny flicker of hope in an age.

932
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:41,737
And next thing I knew,
I was in the chemist's

933
00:54:41,817 --> 00:54:44,536
with my hand around a bottle
of Empress Waving Compound.

934
00:54:44,616 --> 00:54:46,935
-Where did it come from?
-It's imported from New York.

935
00:54:47,015 --> 00:54:48,255
No, no.
I meant the hope.

936
00:54:48,335 --> 00:54:49,854
Oh.

937
00:54:51,694 --> 00:54:52,693
It's a chap.

938
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:56,373
I've known him for ages.

939
00:54:56,453 --> 00:54:59,331
He's awfully quiet, but he has
the most speaking eyes.

940
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:03,130
And he just looked at me,
and I had this sense

941
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,890
that maybe he was
going to ask me something.

942
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,409
Good luck!

943
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:13,208
<i>The record-breaking</i>
<i>aviatrix Amy Johnson</i>

944
00:55:13,248 --> 00:55:15,327
<i>finally touched down</i>
<i>on British soil this week</i>

945
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:18,325
<i>after her triumphant flight</i>
<i>from Cape Town in South Africa.</i>

946
00:55:18,405 --> 00:55:20,885
<i>With clouds and wind adding</i>
<i>to the danger of the journey,</i>

947
00:55:20,965 --> 00:55:22,045
<i>Amy has proven once again</i>

948
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:23,804
<i>that by sheer skill</i>
<i>and determination,</i>

949
00:55:23,884 --> 00:55:26,003
<i>there's no difficulty</i>
<i>that can't be overcome.</i>

950
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:27,922
Petrova.

951
00:55:28,002 --> 00:55:29,923
What do you think of Theo?

952
00:55:30,802 --> 00:55:33,201
-Theo Dane?
-Yes.

953
00:55:33,281 --> 00:55:35,360
Would you say
she's a nice sort of person?

954
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,721
Is she kind?

955
00:55:36,761 --> 00:55:40,279
Well, she wears
a lot of perfume.

956
00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:43,638
Coty Chypre.
It rubs off on everything.

957
00:55:45,038 --> 00:55:47,597
I could probably bear that.

958
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:49,796
<i>Well, goodbye, Amy.</i>
<i>The very best of luck.</i>

959
00:55:49,836 --> 00:55:52,876
<i>Thanks very much.</i>
<i>I sincerely hope I shall, too.</i>

960
00:55:57,914 --> 00:55:59,673
Come on!
You're being really slow.

961
00:55:59,713 --> 00:56:01,473
Come on.

962
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:04,152
No!
No, no, no!

963
00:56:04,232 --> 00:56:05,352
What are you doing?

964
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:08,630
We're going to tie Posy
to a tree and scalp her!

965
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:09,991
No!

966
00:56:10,071 --> 00:56:11,750
Hello?

967
00:56:13,989 --> 00:56:16,628
I, uh, parked in the lane.

968
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:20,147
Awfully sorry to surprise you,
but there's news from London.

969
00:56:20,227 --> 00:56:22,067
It's all right.
It's good news.

970
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:24,985
Don't kick!

971
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:26,066
Help me!

972
00:56:26,146 --> 00:56:28,505
I can't believe
I'm going for a screen test.

973
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:32,623
I don't know anything about
Charles II's sister Henrietta.

974
00:56:32,703 --> 00:56:34,263
I don't even know
what she looks like.

975
00:56:34,343 --> 00:56:36,942
Well, let's just hope
she had a pimple on her nose.

976
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:38,142
Rat.

977
00:56:38,222 --> 00:56:39,421
Come on, now.

978
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:42,381
Take the dishes down to
the water and get them swilled.

979
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:52,058
Bags I dry.

980
00:56:52,138 --> 00:56:55,297
You always dry.
That's the easy bit.

981
00:56:55,377 --> 00:56:56,856
May I smoke?

982
00:56:56,936 --> 00:56:58,015
Of course.

983
00:57:03,974 --> 00:57:07,533
Mr. Simpson, would you mind
awfully if I had one?

984
00:57:08,093 --> 00:57:09,932
Sorry.
Didn't know you indulged.

985
00:57:10,012 --> 00:57:11,612
Oh, I don't.

986
00:57:11,692 --> 00:57:13,851
At least I never have before.

987
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,971
I suppose,
with the girls and everything,

988
00:57:16,051 --> 00:57:18,650
I don't really get to go
to places where I would.

989
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,368
Thank you.

990
00:57:22,929 --> 00:57:25,608
Nana did wonder
if I ought to have the odd one.

991
00:57:25,688 --> 00:57:28,367
She thinks that it helps
to break up chest congestion.

992
00:57:29,806 --> 00:57:30,966
But honestly,

993
00:57:31,046 --> 00:57:34,445
the thought of sitting alone
in the kitchen in the dark,

994
00:57:34,525 --> 00:57:37,284
dragging away
on my solitary fag...

995
00:57:37,364 --> 00:57:40,684
It's such a tragic picture,
I simply couldn't bear to.

996
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,679
Oh, Lord.
I do feel a fool.

997
00:57:54,759 --> 00:57:57,838
Quick, take it away
before the girls get back.

998
00:58:01,917 --> 00:58:03,756
What time do we need to
leave tomorrow?

999
00:58:04,556 --> 00:58:06,036
9:00 should do it.

1000
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:07,795
We'll be at Shepperton by noon.

1001
00:58:11,274 --> 00:58:13,914
We could perhaps
have tea out afterwards

1002
00:58:13,994 --> 00:58:15,993
on the way back to London.

1003
00:58:18,112 --> 00:58:21,551
I'm afraid I must be home
by 4:00.

1004
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:24,990
I have an appointment
with Theo.

1005
00:58:26,149 --> 00:58:27,829
Oh.

1006
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:31,908
Well, we can't let you be late.

1007
00:58:31,988 --> 00:58:34,987
This will get you wet.

1008
00:58:35,067 --> 00:58:37,187
That's cold!

1009
00:58:38,026 --> 00:58:40,066
Pauline Fossil.
Screen test.

1010
00:58:40,146 --> 00:58:41,705
Mr. Sholsky.

1011
00:58:43,064 --> 00:58:47,024
So, Pauline Fossil.
How old are you?

1012
00:58:47,104 --> 00:58:49,263
I'm nearly 16.

1013
00:58:49,343 --> 00:58:51,982
Do you want to be in movies?

1014
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:54,581
I don't know.
I don't know much about them.

1015
00:58:54,661 --> 00:58:57,020
But you want to be an actress.

1016
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,099
No, I <i>need</i> to be an actress.

1017
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:01,220
Hold it.

1018
00:59:15,894 --> 00:59:18,974
Theo just asked for tea in her
room for her and Mr. Simpson.

1019
00:59:19,054 --> 00:59:20,653
Just leave it outside!

1020
00:59:20,733 --> 00:59:22,133
There you are.

1021
00:59:22,213 --> 00:59:24,972
You've earned this.

1022
00:59:26,172 --> 00:59:27,652
Yes.

1023
00:59:28,851 --> 00:59:31,170
Earl's Court, 4-2-8.

1024
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,328
That's simply wonderful.

1025
00:59:38,288 --> 00:59:41,407
Oh, I'm sorry.
I said, "That's wonderful news."

1026
00:59:41,487 --> 00:59:44,127
Don't move, Pauline.
Stick to your marks.

1027
00:59:46,486 --> 00:59:48,205
Okay, people.
We are going again.

1028
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:49,964
Clear the set, please.

1029
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:52,164
Clear the set.

1030
00:59:52,244 --> 00:59:53,684
Shh, shh, shh.

1031
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:55,523
And...

1032
00:59:55,603 --> 00:59:58,002
Scene 84. Take 1.

1033
01:00:00,482 --> 01:00:02,041
Action.

1034
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:05,400
Write to me while I am gone.

1035
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,320
I will try.

1036
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,158
Not "I will try," but "I will."

1037
01:00:11,238 --> 01:00:12,558
I will.

1038
01:00:12,638 --> 01:00:15,557
Cut. Cut.

1039
01:00:15,597 --> 01:00:17,117
You will what, Pauline?

1040
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,516
Bake him a cake?

1041
01:00:18,596 --> 01:00:20,035
Knit him a sweater?

1042
01:00:20,115 --> 01:00:21,795
Look, your brother here

1043
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:25,354
is... is asking
for an emotional lifeline, okay?

1044
01:00:25,434 --> 01:00:26,954
That's great.
Fantastic, Leo.

1045
01:00:27,034 --> 01:00:28,673
Can we take it again?

1046
01:00:28,753 --> 01:00:30,792
Scene 84. Take 2.

1047
01:00:30,872 --> 01:00:34,831
Not "I will try," but "I will."

1048
01:00:34,871 --> 01:00:35,951
I will.

1049
01:00:36,031 --> 01:00:37,470
Cut, cut, cut.

1050
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,989
Take 3.

1051
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:40,670
I will.

1052
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,709
Cut!

1053
01:00:43,029 --> 01:00:44,148
Can we... Can we talk?

1054
01:00:44,228 --> 01:00:46,187
Excuse me.

1055
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,108
You've got 10 days
on this picture.

1056
01:00:48,148 --> 01:00:49,187
This is your seventh,

1057
01:00:49,267 --> 01:00:51,746
and you've yet to show me
that you're not made of wood.

1058
01:00:52,586 --> 01:00:55,744
We do too many takes.
I can't concentrate.

1059
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:57,745
I can build myself up to it
in the theater.

1060
01:00:57,825 --> 01:00:58,904
I can be a character.

1061
01:00:58,984 --> 01:01:01,823
Honey... Honey, this is
motion pictures now, okay?

1062
01:01:01,903 --> 01:01:03,382
Look, you've got
everything to learn,

1063
01:01:03,422 --> 01:01:04,983
and that's... that's fine.

1064
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:08,221
But you've got to give me
something real.

1065
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:09,661
What's real to you, Pauline?

1066
01:01:09,701 --> 01:01:12,060
What matters most to you
in the world?

1067
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,020
Acting.

1068
01:01:15,459 --> 01:01:18,338
If that is a truthful
answer, there's no hope for you.

1069
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,416
Scene 84. Take 4.

1070
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,855
Action.

1071
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,294
Write to me while I'm gone.

1072
01:01:32,974 --> 01:01:34,573
I will try.

1073
01:01:34,613 --> 01:01:39,052
Not "I will try," but "I will."

1074
01:01:39,132 --> 01:01:40,731
I will.

1075
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:43,730
And cut.

1076
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:44,650
Print.

1077
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,490
Fantastic.
You did it.

1078
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,489
I just thought about my sisters.

1079
01:01:48,569 --> 01:01:50,888
How awful it must be
to live your life alone.

1080
01:01:50,928 --> 01:01:52,408
That was wonderful.

1081
01:01:52,488 --> 01:01:54,688
Okay.
Let's move on.

1082
01:03:00,668 --> 01:03:02,867
Coty Chypre?

1083
01:03:13,743 --> 01:03:15,344
Come on.

1084
01:03:29,899 --> 01:03:31,659
Have you never wanted anything?

1085
01:03:33,898 --> 01:03:36,497
Well, when the war broke out,

1086
01:03:36,577 --> 01:03:38,656
I thought I'd like to drive
an ambulance.

1087
01:03:38,736 --> 01:03:41,895
But of course,
I didn't do anything about it.

1088
01:03:41,935 --> 01:03:43,295
I had you.

1089
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:49,373
Madame, please,
may I change my shoes

1090
01:03:49,453 --> 01:03:50,933
before we start my enchaînement?

1091
01:03:51,932 --> 01:03:53,012
These were my mother's.

1092
01:03:53,092 --> 01:03:55,171
They fit me now.

1093
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:01,049
Small bones.

1094
01:04:02,049 --> 01:04:03,728
High arches.

1095
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:06,848
Like you.

1096
01:04:06,928 --> 01:04:08,887
She was just like me.

1097
01:04:08,927 --> 01:04:11,926
She loved ballet
more than anything.

1098
01:04:11,966 --> 01:04:15,365
I know that because
it was the thing she chose.

1099
01:04:43,557 --> 01:04:45,477
Excellent.

1100
01:04:45,517 --> 01:04:49,315
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1101
01:04:49,355 --> 01:04:51,634
And second.
1, 2, 3...

1102
01:04:51,714 --> 01:04:54,154
Energy, Petrova, energy!
Bored dancers are boring!

1103
01:04:54,234 --> 01:04:57,513
Arabesque!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

1104
01:05:01,071 --> 01:05:02,791
Number 3 for you, Pauline.

1105
01:05:02,871 --> 01:05:04,871
You're in with Dandini.

1106
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:06,710
Can't I share with Petrova?

1107
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:09,269
She's on the fourth floor
with the others in the chorus.

1108
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:10,349
Off you pop.

1109
01:05:10,429 --> 01:05:13,188
The 3 was going back that way,
wasn't it?

1110
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:20,146
Please report to the stage
for trampoline practice

1111
01:05:20,226 --> 01:05:22,105
as soon as possible.

1112
01:05:24,304 --> 01:05:26,024
Hello, Petrova.

1113
01:05:26,105 --> 01:05:27,784
Hello, Winifred.

1114
01:05:27,864 --> 01:05:30,343
Soon a gown of shimmering tulle

1115
01:05:30,383 --> 01:05:34,141
and cape of silk
we will unspool.

1116
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:36,741
Hollywood never
called for Pauline, then?

1117
01:05:36,821 --> 01:05:39,020
The film
isn't out yet, Winifred.

1118
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,179
A pumpkin coach we will create.

1119
01:05:41,219 --> 01:05:43,099
Has Hollywood called for you?

1120
01:05:43,179 --> 01:05:44,619
It's not all gloom.

1121
01:05:44,659 --> 01:05:47,937
I've got an audition for
the Ovaltineys... on the radio.

1122
01:05:48,017 --> 01:05:50,616
But first,
to show what magic means,

1123
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:53,336
I call upon the jumping beans!

1124
01:06:02,933 --> 01:06:05,612
"A King in Exile,"
world premiere.

1125
01:06:05,692 --> 01:06:08,132
Cue for gigantic panic
over frocks.

1126
01:06:10,891 --> 01:06:13,010
-What do you think of that?
-Beautiful.

1127
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:16,090
What can you see Pauline in,
John?

1128
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:18,608
Uh, that shiny stuff
that rustles?

1129
01:06:18,648 --> 01:06:19,768
Uh, taffeta?

1130
01:06:19,848 --> 01:06:21,207
I'm too old for a party dress.

1131
01:06:21,247 --> 01:06:22,927
I see her in powder-blue velvet.

1132
01:06:23,007 --> 01:06:24,607
With a lace bolero!

1133
01:06:24,687 --> 01:06:27,126
Lace bolero?
She'll catch her death.

1134
01:06:27,206 --> 01:06:28,086
Beautiful.

1135
01:06:28,165 --> 01:06:30,564
I'll get my rifle
and shoot you a mink.

1136
01:06:31,645 --> 01:06:33,884
I shall be needing a new dress
very soon.

1137
01:06:33,924 --> 01:06:35,443
What for?

1138
01:06:35,523 --> 01:06:37,163
The Marmara Ballet's
coming to London

1139
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,242
for the first time ever
from Prague,

1140
01:06:39,322 --> 01:06:41,922
and Madame Fidolia
is taking me to see them.

1141
01:06:41,962 --> 01:06:43,881
You don't need something new
for that.

1142
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:47,239
She's booked us a box
<i>and</i> a smoked-salmon supper.

1143
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:07,994
# <i>All is calm</i> #

1144
01:07:08,074 --> 01:07:10,713
# <i>All is bright</i> #

1145
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:13,312
I couldn't sleep.

1146
01:07:13,392 --> 01:07:16,311
I thought it would be
a nice surprise in the morning.

1147
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:23,189
We've had such lovely
Christmases in this house.

1148
01:07:25,029 --> 01:07:27,587
It was even Christmas
when you came to us.

1149
01:07:29,228 --> 01:07:31,107
I think about it
every time it snows.

1150
01:07:35,505 --> 01:07:37,225
Why can't you sleep?

1151
01:07:37,825 --> 01:07:38,905
Is it your cough?

1152
01:07:40,504 --> 01:07:42,463
Not really.

1153
01:07:45,903 --> 01:07:48,142
Can you keep a secret?

1154
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:53,620
I wanted to get you
all together,

1155
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,419
but I'll tear open
if I don't tell someone.

1156
01:07:58,099 --> 01:08:00,817
We can't afford
to live here anymore.

1157
01:08:02,898 --> 01:08:06,576
But what about Pauline's wages
from the film

1158
01:08:06,656 --> 01:08:08,655
and... and the money we're
getting from "Cinderella"?

1159
01:08:08,735 --> 01:08:11,055
This house eats money.

1160
01:08:13,294 --> 01:08:15,293
Even with the boarders?

1161
01:08:16,373 --> 01:08:18,133
Yes.

1162
01:08:19,093 --> 01:08:21,932
And so I'm selling it.

1163
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:22,691
No.

1164
01:08:22,771 --> 01:08:25,490
We'll soon be living
in a nice flat with Nana.

1165
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:28,970
There'll be no need for Clara,
and the boarders will disperse.

1166
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:31,129
You can't do that!
You can't!

1167
01:08:32,328 --> 01:08:34,207
The house belongs to Gum.

1168
01:08:34,287 --> 01:08:37,167
He's been gone for 12 years,
Petrova.

1169
01:08:37,207 --> 01:08:41,725
I spoke to the solicitors,
and they've declared him dead.

1170
01:08:50,323 --> 01:08:51,683
Remember, Posy,

1171
01:08:51,763 --> 01:08:55,801
when Valentin Manoff
got his dancers out of Russia,

1172
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,600
he rescued not just a company,

1173
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,919
but a system of training
200 years old.

1174
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:06,558
I've brought you here to show
you what you might achieve...

1175
01:09:06,638 --> 01:09:08,958
if you are strong enough.

1176
01:09:08,998 --> 01:09:12,356
If you have the courage
and the will.

1177
01:09:21,513 --> 01:09:22,913
Stand still.

1178
01:09:25,513 --> 01:09:27,672
Oh, darling.

1179
01:09:27,712 --> 01:09:30,791
You look... grown up.

1180
01:09:30,871 --> 01:09:34,190
That's the first and last time
I copy anything from <i>Vogue.</i>

1181
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,149
No one made you do it!

1182
01:09:36,789 --> 01:09:38,708
Pauline.

1183
01:09:38,788 --> 01:09:41,188
Why don't you make me go
in a jersey and skirt?

1184
01:09:48,426 --> 01:09:51,265
I feel a complete fraud,
Petrova.

1185
01:09:52,424 --> 01:09:54,544
I'm terrible in that film.

1186
01:09:55,903 --> 01:09:57,783
Tomorrow night my face
is going to be blown up

1187
01:09:57,863 --> 01:09:59,622
as big as a house.

1188
01:10:00,982 --> 01:10:03,181
Everyone's gonna find me out.

1189
01:10:23,975 --> 01:10:25,934
I will dance like that, Madame.

1190
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:28,453
I don't care how long
the training takes.

1191
01:10:31,053 --> 01:10:32,493
Madame?

1192
01:10:33,652 --> 01:10:34,772
Madame?

1193
01:10:38,611 --> 01:10:39,571
Help.

1194
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:41,890
Someone help!

1195
01:10:48,368 --> 01:10:49,807
Posy?

1196
01:10:49,887 --> 01:10:51,846
Posy, is that you?

1197
01:10:53,967 --> 01:10:56,166
What's happened?

1198
01:10:56,206 --> 01:10:58,045
Madame's had a stroke.

1199
01:10:58,125 --> 01:10:59,604
A stroke?

1200
01:11:02,404 --> 01:11:04,403
They took her to the hospital,

1201
01:11:04,443 --> 01:11:07,002
and she can't move
her arm or leg!

1202
01:11:07,082 --> 01:11:09,121
Oh, no.
Poor Madame.

1203
01:11:09,201 --> 01:11:11,481
-Poor lady.
-I'm not crying about Madame!

1204
01:11:11,521 --> 01:11:13,320
I'm crying about me!

1205
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:16,279
My training
can't be broken off now!

1206
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:23,557
You are a selfish
and coldhearted little madam.

1207
01:11:23,597 --> 01:11:25,516
We did not bring you up
to conduct yourself like this.

1208
01:11:25,596 --> 01:11:27,556
Nana is right.
Your behavior is disgraceful.

1209
01:11:27,636 --> 01:11:28,996
She's ambitious, that's all.

1210
01:11:29,036 --> 01:11:31,995
Once upon a time, I thought
ambition was a good thing.

1211
01:11:32,035 --> 01:11:33,954
I thought it would help you
to apply yourselves

1212
01:11:34,034 --> 01:11:36,554
and help you make the most
of your small chances.

1213
01:11:36,634 --> 01:11:38,353
But if it kills off everything
that's nice in you,

1214
01:11:38,433 --> 01:11:40,432
then I am not going to have
ambition in this house.

1215
01:11:40,512 --> 01:11:41,512
Meaning what?

1216
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,711
Meaning that
I will no longer sanction

1217
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:46,071
any of you working on the stage.

1218
01:11:46,151 --> 01:11:47,470
You can't do that!

1219
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:49,549
Oh, yes, I can.
I'm your legal guardian.

1220
01:11:49,629 --> 01:11:51,429
We will never be rich.

1221
01:11:51,509 --> 01:11:52,949
But now the house is sold,

1222
01:11:52,989 --> 01:11:55,388
there's no more need for you
to work or train.

1223
01:11:55,468 --> 01:11:57,107
You can't stop me.

1224
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:58,786
You can't stop me
from doing anything.

1225
01:11:58,866 --> 01:12:00,946
We can stop you from going
to Pauline's premiere.

1226
01:12:01,026 --> 01:12:03,505
You can stay at home tonight...
alone.

1227
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,774
Good luck.

1228
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:45,613
Your name is really small,
Pauline.

1229
01:12:45,693 --> 01:12:47,332
Almost as small as the author's.

1230
01:12:47,412 --> 01:12:50,012
Maybe no one will realize
you're in it.

1231
01:13:00,608 --> 01:13:01,888
You were fantastic!

1232
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:10,565
Let's get you through the back.

1233
01:13:10,605 --> 01:13:11,605
Come on, Pauline.

1234
01:13:11,685 --> 01:13:12,965
I wish I was you!

1235
01:13:13,005 --> 01:13:15,004
She was good, Nana.
She was wonderful.

1236
01:13:18,843 --> 01:13:20,242
-Is she with you?
-Who?

1237
01:13:20,282 --> 01:13:21,602
Miss Posy.

1238
01:13:21,682 --> 01:13:24,521
I went to check on her,
and she's not there.

1239
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:27,480
Little maniac.
She's hiding somewhere.

1240
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:33,039
It's the thought of her alone
out there.

1241
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:35,917
How cold she must be.

1242
01:13:35,997 --> 01:13:37,758
How afraid.

1243
01:13:37,838 --> 01:13:39,677
Posy's not afraid of anything.

1244
01:13:39,757 --> 01:13:41,716
That's what frightens me.

1245
01:15:12,649 --> 01:15:14,448
-Miss Brown?
-No.

1246
01:15:14,488 --> 01:15:15,647
This is Miss Brown.

1247
01:15:15,687 --> 01:15:18,367
Good morning.
David Montague.

1248
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:22,166
I'm the London representative
of United Artists Studios.

1249
01:15:26,165 --> 01:15:27,804
So, you don't speak Russian.

1250
01:15:28,644 --> 01:15:30,803
-I dance Russian.
-Hmph.

1251
01:15:35,122 --> 01:15:37,281
And who did you learn that from?

1252
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,640
Michel Fokine?

1253
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,201
Agrippina Vaganova?

1254
01:15:41,241 --> 01:15:43,640
No.
Evgenia Fidolia.

1255
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:46,079
I see.

1256
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:47,278
Do you?

1257
01:15:47,358 --> 01:15:50,518
You won't see anything at all
until you've watched me dance.

1258
01:15:52,317 --> 01:15:53,197
Mm.

1259
01:16:03,473 --> 01:16:05,034
No sign of her?

1260
01:16:11,791 --> 01:16:15,310
I've been offered a contract
by United Artists.

1261
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:18,069
In Hollywood?

1262
01:16:19,788 --> 01:16:21,709
You ought to be smiling.

1263
01:16:23,228 --> 01:16:25,667
I'd have to go for five years.

1264
01:16:27,226 --> 01:16:28,746
That's five years
without theater

1265
01:16:28,826 --> 01:16:32,345
and not learning all the things
I wanted to know.

1266
01:16:32,945 --> 01:16:34,744
-Hello?
-Posy!

1267
01:16:36,863 --> 01:16:38,943
-Where have you been?
-With Valentin Manoff.

1268
01:16:39,023 --> 01:16:41,502
He's offered to train me
at his ballet school.

1269
01:16:41,582 --> 01:16:42,822
What?

1270
01:16:42,902 --> 01:16:44,581
I made him watch me
dance, and then he said,

1271
01:16:44,661 --> 01:16:46,061
"Come to my academy in Prague,

1272
01:16:46,141 --> 01:16:47,901
and I shall make you
into a ballerina."

1273
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:49,740
So I said my guardian
would make the arrangements,

1274
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:51,739
and I came straight home.

1275
01:16:51,819 --> 01:16:54,339
You can't go
to Czechoslovakia, Posy.

1276
01:16:54,419 --> 01:16:56,258
There's no money.

1277
01:16:57,298 --> 01:16:59,937
My mother gave me away
because there was no money!

1278
01:17:00,016 --> 01:17:01,656
At least your parents drowned

1279
01:17:01,736 --> 01:17:04,256
and had the kindness
to put you in a life belt.

1280
01:17:04,336 --> 01:17:09,374
I didn't get a life belt,
only a pair of ballet shoes.

1281
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:16,092
Garnie, is Mr. Montague
still upstairs?

1282
01:17:16,172 --> 01:17:18,371
He's packing up his bag.

1283
01:17:18,451 --> 01:17:20,571
I said you needed time to think.

1284
01:17:20,651 --> 01:17:23,370
I don't.
Not anymore.

1285
01:17:24,169 --> 01:17:25,289
I'll sign.

1286
01:17:27,129 --> 01:17:28,289
Sign what?

1287
01:17:29,408 --> 01:17:31,687
Something that means
you can study with Manoff.

1288
01:17:31,767 --> 01:17:34,406
And Garnie can go to California,
where the climate's mild,

1289
01:17:34,486 --> 01:17:35,806
and get her health back.

1290
01:17:35,886 --> 01:17:37,286
Pauline...

1291
01:17:37,326 --> 01:17:39,645
I can't live in Hollywood
on my own,

1292
01:17:39,725 --> 01:17:41,924
and Nana must go to Prague
with Posy.

1293
01:17:42,004 --> 01:17:44,524
Otherwise, she's going to get
completely out of hand.

1294
01:17:48,162 --> 01:17:50,001
Where will I go?

1295
01:17:50,081 --> 01:17:51,762
Excuse me!

1296
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,479
Who sold my house?!

1297
01:17:57,559 --> 01:17:59,319
Huh?

1298
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:03,038
Are you... Gum?

1299
01:18:03,118 --> 01:18:05,877
Of course, I'm bloody Gum.
Who else would I be?

1300
01:18:05,957 --> 01:18:08,517
What I want to know is this.

1301
01:18:09,916 --> 01:18:11,156
Who are all these women?

1302
01:18:13,714 --> 01:18:15,474
Pauline.

1303
01:18:15,514 --> 01:18:17,074
Petrova.

1304
01:18:17,114 --> 01:18:17,914
Posy.

1305
01:18:19,073 --> 01:18:20,872
I-I brought entrancements home.

1306
01:18:20,952 --> 01:18:23,231
I-I brought babies.

1307
01:18:23,311 --> 01:18:25,312
Babies grow up, Gum.

1308
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,510
Yes, I can see that.

1309
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:33,669
So, a film star
and a ballet dancer.

1310
01:18:33,749 --> 01:18:36,628
Well, that's you
and your chaperones sorted.

1311
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:38,987
I never thought I'd be going
to live abroad.

1312
01:18:39,067 --> 01:18:41,747
Abroad will get used to it.

1313
01:18:41,827 --> 01:18:43,746
So that just leaves you and me
to organize.

1314
01:18:43,826 --> 01:18:45,345
Now, what would you like to do?

1315
01:18:45,425 --> 01:18:47,424
She wants to be
like Amy Johnson.

1316
01:18:47,504 --> 01:18:48,745
Oh, Amy Johnson.

1317
01:18:48,825 --> 01:18:50,864
-I know her.
-How?

1318
01:18:50,904 --> 01:18:52,863
Well, I ran into her
in the Argentine.

1319
01:18:52,943 --> 01:18:55,902
She taught me how to fly.
She's quite good, actually.

1320
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:58,422
Well, we'd better get you
some lessons, then, hadn't we?

1321
01:19:16,856 --> 01:19:18,655
Mixed feelings?

1322
01:19:22,135 --> 01:19:24,094
I'm not telling.

1323
01:19:27,932 --> 01:19:29,212
Theo?

1324
01:19:30,492 --> 01:19:31,812
Theo.

1325
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:37,569
I, uh, I need
to ask you something.

1326
01:19:40,529 --> 01:19:42,008
Can I borrow your gramophone?

1327
01:19:54,365 --> 01:19:58,163
Theo's been giving me lessons.

1328
01:20:00,882 --> 01:20:03,162
I wanted to take you out...

1329
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:06,281
...to a hotel.

1330
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,759
I wanted to dance with you,
to tell you things.

1331
01:20:13,839 --> 01:20:15,598
And I didn't know how.

1332
01:20:19,278 --> 01:20:21,357
I thought this...

1333
01:20:23,036 --> 01:20:25,035
...this song, it...

1334
01:20:27,595 --> 01:20:29,714
...might tell you things.

1335
01:20:33,073 --> 01:20:37,752
# <i>The very thought of you</i> #

1336
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:42,750
# <i>And I forget to do</i> #

1337
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:47,309
# <i>The little ordinary things</i> #

1338
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:51,828
# <i>That everyone ought to do</i> #

1339
01:20:52,867 --> 01:20:58,425
# <i>I'm living in</i>
<i>a kind of a daydream</i> #

1340
01:20:58,505 --> 01:21:03,264
# <i>I'm happy as a king</i> #

1341
01:21:03,304 --> 01:21:08,263
# <i>And foolish</i>
<i>though it may seem</i> #

1342
01:21:08,343 --> 01:21:12,741
# <i>To me, that's everything</i> #

1343
01:21:12,821 --> 01:21:16,540
This was the first room I ever
walked into in this house.

1344
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:22,738
It was full of stone feathers
and the ghosts of things.

1345
01:21:22,818 --> 01:21:26,057
# <i>You'll never know how slow</i> #

1346
01:21:26,137 --> 01:21:27,897
Not anymore.

1347
01:21:29,016 --> 01:21:30,416
No.

1348
01:21:31,295 --> 01:21:33,135
It's full of things we made.

1349
01:21:33,215 --> 01:21:38,533
# <i>I see your face</i>
<i>in every flower</i> #

1350
01:21:38,613 --> 01:21:42,972
# <i>Your eyes in stars above</i> #

1351
01:21:43,052 --> 01:21:46,051
# <i>It's just the thought of you</i> #

1352
01:21:46,131 --> 01:21:48,971
# <i>The very thought of you</i> #

1353
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:54,129
# <i>My love</i> #

1354
01:21:56,927 --> 01:21:57,928
Hello.

1355
01:21:59,807 --> 01:22:02,326
Miss Brown is otherwise engaged.

1356
01:22:02,406 --> 01:22:04,085
I haven't come to see
Miss Brown.

1357
01:22:04,165 --> 01:22:07,085
I've, uh, I've come to see you.

1358
01:22:07,845 --> 01:22:10,044
You don't remember me, do you?

1359
01:22:11,643 --> 01:22:17,402
Little Theodora, star of
"Miss Rosebud's Bouncing Babes"?

1360
01:22:17,482 --> 01:22:21,681
We used to meet at the stage
door every night for weeks.

1361
01:22:22,841 --> 01:22:23,840
During the war?

1362
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:28,358
I knew you at once,
even without your bandages.

1363
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:33,197
Do you know who I am
without mine?

1364
01:22:33,277 --> 01:22:35,916
Yes.

1365
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:40,155
We <i>two</i> Fossils vow, since
as an actress and a dancer,

1366
01:22:40,195 --> 01:22:42,114
it is unlikely
we will ever get our names

1367
01:22:42,154 --> 01:22:45,113
in the history books,
to do everything we can

1368
01:22:45,153 --> 01:22:48,873
to get our sister's name,
Petrova, there instead.

1369
01:22:50,312 --> 01:22:53,671
Because she is ours
and ours alone.

1370
01:22:53,711 --> 01:22:56,830
And when she finds
the roads in the sky,

1371
01:22:56,910 --> 01:23:00,349
no one can ever say it's because
of her grandfathers.

1372
01:23:00,429 --> 01:23:02,108
We vow.

1373
01:23:02,148 --> 01:23:03,269
We vow.

1374
01:23:04,548 --> 01:23:05,748
We vow.

1375
01:23:11,946 --> 01:23:13,265
-Amen.
-Amen.

1376
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:27,861
There she is!

1377
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:31,660
Petrova!

1378
01:23:33,339 --> 01:23:34,738
Hi!

1379
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:44,456
Full throttle, Petrova!
