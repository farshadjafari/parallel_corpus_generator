1
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,387
- Mommy's going to
the beauty parlor, darling.

2
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,181
But I'm leaving you
with your favorite friend, Roger.

3
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,059
He's going to take
very, very good care of you.

4
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,896
Because if he doesn't,
he's going back to the science lab.

5
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,065
P-p-please, don't worry.

6
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,276
Whatever you say.
Yes, ma'am.

7
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,070
Aye, aye, sir.
Okey do key.

8
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,490
Why, I'll take care of him
like he was my own brother.

9
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:17,494
Or my own sister. Ow!
Or my brother's sister.

10
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,998
- Or my second cousin,
who is twice removed...
- Cookie!

11
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,960
Or my ninth cousin, who is nine times
removed from his place outside.

12
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,298
Or like my fifteenth cousin, who is sixteen
times removed from his mother's side,

13
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,383
Or like my twenty-second cousin,

14
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,970
- who is thirty-seven times
removed from his father's side,
- Cookie.

15
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,972
who is 11 times removed...

16
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:42,686
...like my seventeenth cousin,
who is 156 times removed from any side!

17
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,863
Aah!

18
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,992
I'll save ya, Baby!

19
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,161
Cookie.

20
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,872
Don't burn yourself, Baby Herman! Whoa!

21
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:05,083
Whoa! Ah! W-Whoa!

22
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,463
Whoa! Wow!

23
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,174
Whoa!

24
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,178
Who turned out the lights?
Boy, it's dark in here.

25
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,680
Don't they pay their electricity?

26
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,682
What happened? I'll find ya, Baby!
Where are you?

27
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,477
- Cookie.
- Where am I?

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,774
- What's that smoke?

29
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,981
Cookie.

30
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,697
Cookie.

31
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,662
I'm here, Bab...
Aah!

32
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,269
Cookie.

33
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,496
Cookie. Ahh.

34
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,794
Cut!

35
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,172
All right, that's the shot,

36
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,466
 Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

37
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,969
What the hell was wrong with that take?
- Nothing with you, Baby Herman.

38
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,263
You were great. You were perfect.
You were better than perfect.

39
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,891
Just Roger.
He keeps blowing his lines!

40
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,477
- Roger, what's this?
- A tweeting bird.

41
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,479
A tweeting bird?

42
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,481
Roger, read the script. Look what it says.

43
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,901
It says, "Rabbit gets clunked.
Rabbit sees stars".

44
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,861
Not birds, stars!

45
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,072
- Can we lose the playback, please?

46
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,991
- Roger, you're killin' me. Killin' me.
- For cryin' out loud, Roger!

47
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,786
How the hell many times
do we have to do this damn scene?

48
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,163
Raoul, I'll be in my trailer!

49
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,375
- Takin' a nap! 'Scuse me, Toots.
-

50
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,461
My stomach can't take this.
This set is a mess. Clean this set up.

51
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,797
And get him outta there
or seal him up in it!

52
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,882
- Lose the lights. And say lunch.
- Lunch!

53
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,884
That's lunch. We're on a half.

54
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,886
P-please, Raoul, I can give you stars.

55
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,472
Just drop the refrigerator
on my head one more time.

56
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,683
Roger, I dropped it
on your head 23 times already.

57
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,685
I can take it.
Don't worry about me.

58
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,188
I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about the refrigerator.

59
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,774
- I can give you stars. Look!
-

60
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,195
Look. Look!

61
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,865
Please, Raoul, I can doit, I swear,

62
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,867
- Just give me another chance,

63
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,369
Toons.

64
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,963
Mr. Maroon, Mr. Valiant's here to...

65
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,966
He'll be right with you.

66
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:54,897
No, no, no! Wait until he gets to
his feet, Then hit him with the boulder,

67
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,774
Right, R.K.

68
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,069
How much do you know about
show business, Mr. Valiant?

69
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,698
Only there's no business like it,
no business I know.

70
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,284
Yeah, and there's
no business more expensive.

71
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,579
I'm 25 grand over budget on
the latest Baby Herman cartoon.

72
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,790
You saw the rabbit blowin' his lines.
He can't keep his mind on his work.

73
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,002
- You know why?
- One too many refrigerators
dropped on his head?

74
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,464
Nah, he's a toon.
You can drop anything you want
on his head, he'll shake it off.

75
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,884
But break his heart, he goes
to pieces, just like you or me.

76
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,969
Read that.

77
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,475
"Seen Cooing over Calamari
with Not-So-New Sugar Daddy...

78
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:35,103
Was Jessica Rabbit, Wife of
Maroon Cartoon Star Roger".

79
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,064
What's this got to do with me?

80
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,066
You're the private detective.
You figure it out.

81
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,068
Look, I don't have time for this.

82
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:45,072
Look, Valiant, his wife's poison,
but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.

83
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,366
I want you to follow her.

84
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:51,286
Get me a couple of nice, juicy pictures
I can wise the rabbit up with.

85
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,372
Forget it.
I don't work Toontown.

86
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:57,668
- What's wrong with Toontown?
Every Joe loves Toontown.
- Then get Joe to do the job.

87
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,170
- 'Cause I ain't goin'.
- Whoa, fella.

88
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,798
You don't want to go to Toontown,
you don't have to go to Toontown.

89
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:06,093
Nobody said you had
to go to Toontown anyway.

90
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:09,596
Have a seat, Valiant.

91
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,891
The rabbit's wife sings at a joint
called the Ink and Paint Club.

92
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:16,770
Toon revue.
Strictly humans only, okay?

93
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,190
So what do you think, Valiant?

94
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,694
Well?

95
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,285
The job's gonna cost ya a hundred bucks,

96
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,996
- plus expenses,
- A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous.

97
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,583
- So's the job.
- All right, all right.

98
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,794
You got your hundred bucks.
Have a drink, Eddie.

99
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,088
I don't mind if I do.

100
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:46,675
- Careful, Dave!
Dave, you're gonna drop it,
- I got it,

101
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,178
- I'm not gonna drop it!
- You're dropping it!

102
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:52,181
- Watch it!
- Oh, no, the chairs are out!

103
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,864
Kinda jumpy, aren't ya, Valiant?

104
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,367
- It's just Dumbo.
- I know who it is.

105
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,370
I got him on loan from Disney...

106
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,999
him and half the cast of Fantasia,

107
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,502
The best part is,

108
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,880
- they work for peanuts.
-

109
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,472
Well, I don't work for peanuts.

110
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,474
Where's the other $50?

111
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,103
Let's call the other $50
a carrot to finish the job.

112
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,065
You been hangin' around rabbits too long.

113
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,073
Hmph!

114
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,892
Oh, excuse me.

115
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:50,299
Uh, taxi? Uh, cab?

116
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,801
Hi, there.

117
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,269
What do I look like, a bank?

118
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,070
Wait for me!

119
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,781
- Hey, guys, wait up!
- Come on, hurry up.

120
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,783
- Come on, Sid!
- Hurry up,

121
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,870
- Hey, mister, ain't ya got a car?
- Who needs a car in L.A.?

122
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,372
We got the best public transportation
system in the world.

123
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,794
Come on, Frank,
Keep the line tight,

124
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,881
- It's goin'.
- All right, easy, easy.

125
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,481
- So long, sir,
- See you later,

126
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,566
- So long, mister.
- Thanks for the cigarettes.

127
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,568
- You bet,
- Any time,

128
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,205
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Eddie. How's it goin'?

129
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,667
- Okay. What you got for me?
- The usual bills.

130
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,670
Hey, gimme back my ball,

131
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,601
- Hi, Harry. You okay?
- Hi, Eddie.

132
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,404
What's with Earl?

133
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,868
Laid off?

134
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,870
A new outfit bought the Red Car.

135
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,872
Some big company called Cloverleaf.

136
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,374
No kiddin'.
They bought the Red Car?

137
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:51,378
Yeah. Put the poor guy on
two weeks' notice. Cutbacks, they said.

138
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,593
Oh, well, Earl.

139
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,595
Here's to the pencil-pushers.

140
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,097
May they all get lead poisoning, eh?

141
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:09,479
Tomorrow's Friday, Eddie.
You know what happens here on Friday?

142
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:13,901
- Fish Special?
- My boss checks the books on Friday.

143
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,904
And if I don't have that money
I gave you back in the till,

144
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,573
- I'm gonna lose my job.
- Don't bust a button, Dolores.

145
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,575
You've only got one left.

146
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,577
- Fifty bucks?
- Yeah.

147
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,788
Where's the rest?

148
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,583
Well, it's only a snoop job away.

149
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,668
Have you got that camera of yours?

150
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,671
- Mine's in the shop.
- Wouldn't be the pawn shop
by any chance, would it?

151
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:38,383
Aw, come on, Dolores. You need
the other $50, I need the camera.

152
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,889
Any film in there?

153
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,893
Should be.

154
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,479
I haven't had that roll developed
since our trip to Catalina.

155
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,481
That sure was a long time ago.

156
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,275
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

157
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,403
- We'll have to do that again sometime.
- Yeah, sure, Eddie.

158
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,287
- Paper even good?
- Just check the scrawl.

159
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:10,582
R.K. Maroon?
As in Maroon Cartoons?

160
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,793
Maroon Cartoons?

161
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,587
Hey, so who's your client,

162
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,798
Mr. Detective to the Stars?

163
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,384
Chilly Willy?

164
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,469
Or Screwy Squirrel?


165
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,681
- What do you want to drink?
- I'll take a beer, doll.

166
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,184
So what happened, huh?
Somebody kidnap Dinky Doodle?

167
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,186
Cut it out, Angelo,

168
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,480
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I know.

169
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,482
You're workin' for Little Bo Peep.

170
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:39,486
She's lost her sheep, and
you're gonna help her find 'em. Eh?

171
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,200
- Ow!
- Get this straight, meatball.

172
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:48,787
I... don't... work for toons.

173
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,671
So what's his problem?

174
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,884
- Toon killed his brother.
- What?

175
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,097
Dropped a piano on his head.

176
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,694
Got the password?

177
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,696
"Walt sent me".

178
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,172
- Nice monkey suit.
- Wiseass.

179
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,579
- Hey, look at that.
-

180
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,999
Hey, cut it out!

181
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,669
Does anybody understand
what this duck is saying?

182
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,594
- Hmm, Most amusing,
- A little more wine?

183
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,681
I've worked with a lot of wise-quackers,

184
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,975
but you are despicable!

185
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,102
Dog gone, stubborn nitwit!

186
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,104
That did it!


187
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,273
 This is the last time
I work with someone,

188
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,775
- with a speech impediment!
- Oh, yeah?

189
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,071
This means war.

190
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,293
- What, do you think that's funny?
- Oh, it's a panic.

191
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,379
You won't think it's funny
when I stick that pen up your nose.

192
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,674
Now calm down, son, will ya?
Look, the stain's gone.

193
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,093
It's disappearing ink.
No hard feelings, I hope.

194
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,679
- Look, I'm...
- I know who you are.

195
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,974
Marvin Acme, the guy
that owns Toontown. The Gag King.

196
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,394
"If it's Acme, it's a gasser".
Put it there, pal.

197
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,901
The hand buzzer.
Still our biggest seller.

198
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,993
Scotch on the rocks.

199
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,579
And I mean, ice!

200
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,295
This is hot stuff.

201
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:51,803
Yeah!

202
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,570
Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

203
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,292
Hey, those ducks are funny.

204
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,379
They-They never get to finish the act.

205
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,006
- Great. Thanks.
- Rocks.

206
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,680
- Toons.
- Cigars? Cigarettes?

207
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:39,184
- Eddie Valiant!
- Betty?

208
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,687
Long time no see.

209
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:46,692
- What are you doing here?
- Work's been kind aslow
since cartoons went to color,

210
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:50,571
But I still got it, Eddie.
Boop boop be-doop, boop!

211
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:54,783
- Yeah. You still got it.
-

212
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:05,878
- What's with him?
- Mr, Acme never misses
a night when Jessica performs,

213
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:08,005
Got a thing for rabbits, huh?

214
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:21,101
# You had plenty money #

215
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:24,396
# In 1922 #

216
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,398
# You let #

217
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,610
# Other women make a #

218
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,695
# Fool of you #

219
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:35,282
# Why don't ya do right #

220
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,079
# Like some other men #

221
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,207
# Do #

222
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,298
# Get outta here #

223
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:55,302
- She's married to Roger Rabbit?
-# Get me some money#

224
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:59,890
-# Too #
- Yeah. What a lucky girl.

225
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,395
# Now, if you had prepared #

226
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:09,483
# Twenty years ago #

227
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:13,195
# You wouldn't be wanderin' now #

228
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,697
# From door to door #

229
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:21,787
# Why don't ya do right #

230
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,082
# Like some other men #

231
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,710
# Do #

00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:36,009
# Get outta here #

00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:42,474
# Get me some money too #

234
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:50,691
# Get outta here #

235
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:57,489
# Get me some money too #

236
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:05,998
# Why don'tya do right #

237
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:10,711
# Like some other men #

238
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:27,978
# Do #

239
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,373
 Who is it?

240
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,877
Jessica, dear, have no fear.
Your Marvin is here.

241
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:56,173
 You sure murdered 'em
a gain tonight, baby,

242
00:20:56,298 --> 00:21:00,177
I really mean it,
My darling, you were superb,

243
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,971
You absolutely, truly and honestly,

244
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,307
fashmolyed that audience,

245
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,893
You killed them, You slayed them,

246
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,896
- You belted them, You were terrific,

247
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,484
What do you think you're doing, chump?

248
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,694
Who are you callin' a chump, chimp?

249
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:30,082
And don't let me catch your peepin' face
around here again, got it?

250
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,877
Ooga-booga!

251
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:55,691
Come, my dear Jessica, Come over here,

252
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:59,403
I've got everything arranged
right here on the bed,

253
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:03,198
 Oh, not tonight, Marvin,
I have a headache,

254
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:06,285
 But Jessica, you promised,

255
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,412
 Oh, all right,

256
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,373
But this time, take off that handbuzzer,

257
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:16,503
 Patty-cake,

258
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:20,007
- Patty-cake, Patty-cake,
- Oh, Marvin,

259
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,009
- Patty-cake,
- Marvin!

260
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:25,888
- Patty-cake, Patty-cake,
- Marvin, Oh!

261
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:27,890
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
- Oh, Marvin!

262
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,892
- Patty-cake, Patty-cake, Patty-cake!
- Oh, no, Marv...

263
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:31,894
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
- You gotta be kiddin' me.

264
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,771
Patty-cake, patty-cake?

265
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:37,900
I don't believe it!

266
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,779
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

267
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,199
Is that true?

268
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:49,203
Take comfort, son. You're not the first
man whose wife played patty-cake on him.

269
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,795
I just don't believe it.

270
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:01,673
I won't believe it.
I can't believe it.

271
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,675
I shan't believe it.

272
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,595
Believe it, kid.
I took the pictures myself.

273
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:09,181
- She played patty-cake.
- No!

274
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:12,309
Not my Jessica.
Not patty-cake!

275
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,811
This is impossible.
I don't believe it.

276
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:16,980
It can't be.
It can't be!

277
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,776
Jessica's my wife.
It's absolutely impossible!

278
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,195
Jessica's the light of my life.

279
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:26,281
The apple of my eye.
The cream in my coffee.

280
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,576
You better start drinkin' it black,
'cause Acme's takin' the cream now.

281
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:33,580
Hard to believe. Marvin Acme's been
my friend and neighbor for 30 years.

282
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,582
Who would've thought he was a sugar daddy?

283
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,377
Somebody must a made her do it,

284
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:41,505
Now drink this, son.
It'll make you feel better.

285
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,789
Thanks. I needed that.

286
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:22,588
Son of a bitch.


287
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:24,590
Look, Mr. Maroon.

288
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:27,676
I think my work here is finished.

289
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:31,180
- How 'bout that carrot you owe me, huh?

290
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,682
- A deal's a deal.
- Great.

291
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,977
Thanks. Phew.

292
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:38,979
Roger,

293
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:41,607
I know all this seems pretty painful now.

294
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,984
But you'll find someone new.

295
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:46,612
- Won't he, Mr. Valiant?
- Yeah, sure.

296
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:49,406
A good-looking guy like that?


297
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:52,576
- The dames will be breakin' his door down.
- Dames? What dames?

298
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:54,786
Jessica's the only one for me.
You'll see!

299
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:56,788
We'll rise above this piddling peccadillo.

300
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:01,210
We're gonna be happy again. Got that?
Happy. Capital H-A-P-P-I.

301
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,303
Well, at least he took it well.

302
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,105
Oh, Jessica.

303
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:25,984
Please tell me it's not true.

304
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:32,199
P-p-please.

305
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:55,008
Oh, Lieutenant Santino.

306
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:59,596
Where'd you come from?

307
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:03,183
Gee whiz, Eddie. If you needed money
so bad, why didn't you come to me?

308
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:06,603
So I took a couple
of dirty pictures. So kill me.

309
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:09,815
- I already got a stiff
on my hands, thank you,
- Huh?

310
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,484
Marvin Acme.

311
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:16,613
- The rabbit kacked him last night.
- What?

312
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:29,501
Now what?

313
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:32,796
It's just I haven't been
this close to Toontown for a while.

314
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,092
Yeeow!

315
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:39,386
Oof, oof, oof! Ow!

316
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:42,306
My biscuits are burnin'!
Fire in the hatch! Ow! Ooh!

317
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,892
Eee! Great horny toads, that smarts!

318
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:53,775
Come on, Eddie.
Let's get this overwith.

319
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,907
He's with me.

320
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:08,415
- I didn't see anything, I mean,
the worst of it...
- Come on, Lieutenant,

321
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:12,586
Just like a toon to drop a safe
on a guy's head,

322
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:17,090
Sorry, Eddie.
You better wait here, all right?

323
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,384
You got a positive I,D, on the victim?

324
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,606
Hey, Chisold, get a load of this.

325
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:35,692
You seen one of these?

326
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:42,115
Hey, guys,

327
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:56,088
Didn't you used to be Eddie Valiant?


328
00:29:56,213 --> 00:30:00,384
- Or did you change your name
to Jack Daniels?

329
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:10,185
- What's that?
- Paint from the rabbit's glove.

330
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,187
Mr, Valiant?

331
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:20,487
I hope you're proud of yourself
and those pictures you took!

332
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:29,496
- Oh, for cryin' out loud, Mike,
-

333
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,000
Hey, we need some help over here!
Hey, somebody grab those loafers!

334
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:05,699
Is this man removing evidence
from the scene of a crime?

335
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:09,286
Uh, no, Judge Doom. Uh, Valiant here
was just pickin' it up for ya.

336
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,288
Weren't ya, Eddie?

337
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:14,208
- Hand it over.
- Sure.

338
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:19,713
His number-one seller.

339
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:24,009
I see working for a toon
has rubbed off on you.

340
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:30,015
- I wasn't workin' for a toon.
I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
- Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.

341
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:34,394
He told us the rabbit became quite agitated
when you showed him the pictures.

342
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:38,607
The rabbit said, one way or another,
he and his wife are going to be happy.

343
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,609
Is that true?

344
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,903
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?

345
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,905
Shut your yap, Eddie.
The man's a judge.

346
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,907
That's all right, Lieutenant.

347
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,285
From the smell of him,
I'd say it was the booze talking.

348
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,996
No matter.
The rabbit won't get far.

349
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,207
My men will find him.

350
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:05,801
- Weasels?
- Yes. I find they have
a special gift for the work.

351
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,887
All right, ya mugs.
Fall out.

352
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,889
Did you find the rabbit?

353
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:14,977
Don't worry, Judge.
We got "deformants" all over the city.

354
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:17,396
- We'll find 'im.

355
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:21,400
You wouldn't have any idea where
the rabbit might be, Mr. Valiant?

356
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:25,487
Have you tried Walla Walla?
Cucamonga?

357
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:28,615
I hear Kokomo's very nice
this time of the year.

358
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:31,410
I'm surprised you're not
more cooperative, Mr. Valiant.

359
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:35,497
A human has been murdered by a toon.
Don't you appreciate the magnitude of that?

360
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:44,298
Since I've had Toontown
under my jurisdiction,

361
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:47,801
my goal has been to reign in the insanity.

362
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:51,597
And the only way to do that
is to make toons respect...

363
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,599
- the law.

364
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:08,488
How did that gargoyle get to be a judge?

365
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:11,992
Spread a bunch of simoleons
around Toontown a couple of years back.

366
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:15,204
- Bought the election.
- Yeah? What's that?

367
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:20,792
Remember how they always thought
there wasn't a way to kill a toon?

368
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,794
- Yeah,
- Well, Doom found a way,

369
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:26,381
Turpentine, acetone, benzene,
He calls it "The Dip".

370
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:28,717
I'll catch the rabbit, Mr, Valiant,

371
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,678
And I'll try him, convict him...

372
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:34,389
- and execute him.
-

373
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:45,400
Geez!

374
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:54,910
That's one dead shoe, eh, Boss?

375
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:57,788
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.

376
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:02,084
This is how we handle things
down in Toontown.

377
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:05,087
I'd think you, of all people,
would appreciate that.

378
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,596
#

379
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,890
#La, la, la, la, la, la, la#

380
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,396
#

381
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:25,691
Uh... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, wait a minute! Hey, hey!

382
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:28,193
#La, la, la, la, la, la, la#

383
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:32,489
I've been tryin' to make him quit,
but he just won't listen to me,

384
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:34,700
What do you know, ya dumb broad?
You got the I.Q. of a rattle.

385
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:36,910
- You Valiant?
- Yeah.

386
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:39,913
I want to talk to you
about the Acme murder. Hey, psst.

387
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:43,083
Doll, why don't you run downstairs
and get me a racin' form?

388
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:46,378
Ooh! Okay, okay. I'm goin'.

389
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:49,506
A ladies' man, huh?

390
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,384
My problem is I got a 50-year-old lust
and a three-year-old dinky.

391
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:56,513
-Yeah. Must be tough.
-Look, Valiant, the rabbit didn't kill Acme,

392
00:34:56,597 --> 00:35:00,017
He's not a murderer, I should know,
He's a dear friend of mine,

393
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,687
I tell you, Valiant, the whole thing
stinks like yesterday's diapers.

394
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:07,191
Look at this.
The paper said Acme left no will.

395
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:10,694
That's a load of succotash.
Every toon knows Acme had a will.

396
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:13,113
He promised to leave Toontown to us toons.

397
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:15,115
That will is the reason he got bumped off,

398
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,117
Has anybody ever seen this will?

399
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:19,786
Uh, no. But he gave us his solemn oath.

400
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:25,292
If you believe that that joker could do
anything solid, the gag's on you, pal.

401
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:28,378
I just figured, since you were
the one who got my pal in trouble,

402
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:30,506
you might want to help get him out,

403
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:33,091
I can pay ya.

404
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:36,303
Save your money for
a pair of elevator shoes.

405
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:39,806
- Wait! No, Valiant, no! Ow, my stogie!
- Oh!

406
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:44,019
Wah!

407
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:47,606
Wah!

408
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:49,608
Wah!

409
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,699
It ain't my fault the rabbit
got himself in trouble.

410
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:04,706
All I did was take
a couple of lousy pictures.

411
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:27,688
Baby was right,

412
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,908
The hell with it.

413
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:13,609
- How the hell did you get in here?
- Through the mail slot.

414
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:17,613
I thought it would be best if I waited
inside, seeing's how I'm wanted for murder.

415
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:20,991
No kidding. Just talking to you could
get me a rap for Aiding and Abetting.

416
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:23,994
Wait a minute.
Anybody know you're here?

417
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,705
- Nobody. Not a soul, except, uh...
- Who?

418
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:28,707
Well, you see,

419
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,710
I didn't know where your office was.

420
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:33,712
So I asked a newsboy.
He didn't know.

421
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:36,507
So I asked the fireman, the greengrocer,
the butcher, the baker.

422
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,718
They didn't know.
But the liquor store guy, he knew.

423
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:41,887
- In other words, the whole
damn town knows you're here!
- Hey! Hey!

424
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,181
- Come on! Come on!
- All right.
Eddie, take it easy, will ya?

425
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:47,100
Please, Eddie, don't throw me out.
You're making a big mistake.

426
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:49,394
I didn't kill anybody.
I swear!

427
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:53,482
This whole thing's a setup,
a scam, a frame job. Ow!

428
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:55,692
Eddie, I could never hurt anybody. Ow!

429
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:59,112
My whole purpose...
in... life... is... to...

430
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:02,616
- make... people...
-

431
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:05,786
- laugh.
-

432
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,996
Okay, okay, sure.
I admit it.

433
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:11,792
I got a little steamed when
you showed me those pictures of Jessica,

434
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:15,003
-
-So I rushed over to the Ink and Paint Club.

435
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:19,007
But she wasn't in her dressing room,
So I wrote her a love letter,

436
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:21,718
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

437
00:38:21,802 --> 00:38:25,889
You're telling me, in a fit of jealousy,
you wrote your wife a love letter?

438
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:30,602
That's right. I know that she was just
an innocent victim of circumstance.

439
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:33,480
I suppose you used the old
lipstick-on-the-mirror routine, huh?

440
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:35,482
Lipstick, yes,
Mirror, no,

441
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:39,695
I found a nice, clean piece of paper.
"Dear Jessica,

442
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,907
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.

443
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:47,411
"One, one thousand. Two, one thousand.
Three, one thousand.

444
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:50,581
- Four, one thousand. Five..."
- Why didn't you just leave
the letter there?

445
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:54,918
Obviously, a poem of this power
and sensitivity must... Aah...

446
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,920
be read in person.

447
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:58,881
So I went home to wait for her.

448
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:02,801
But the weasels were
there waitin' for me. So... So I ran.

449
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:07,389
So why come to me? I'm the guy
that took the pictures of your wife.

450
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:10,184
Yeah. And you're also the guy
that helped all these toons.

451
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:15,105
Everybody knows when a toon's in trouble,
there's only one place to go:

452
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:18,609
- Valiant and Valiant.
- Not anymore.

453
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:21,195
Get outta that chair!

454
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:27,618
- That's my brother's chair.
- Yeah, where is your brother, anyway?

455
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:30,621
He looks like a sensitive...
and sober... fellow.

456
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:33,081
That's it.
I'm callin' the cops.

457
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:35,083
Go ahead,
Call the cops,

458
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,794
I come here for help, and what do you do?

459
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,298
You turn me in. No, no.
Don't feel guilty about me.

460
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:44,718
So long, and thanks for nothin',

461
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:49,389
That's the closet!
Stupe.

462
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:06,615
Eddie Valiant, you're under arrest.

463
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,700
Get outta there!

464
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:12,704
- Idiot. I got no keys for these cuffs.
- Huh?

465
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,292
Yah!

466
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:23,090
Come on.
Get the lead out.

467
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:25,801
- Move it, would ya? Move it!

468
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:29,721
Yah! It's the Toon Patrol!

469
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:36,186
Hide me, Eddie!
P-p-please!

470
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:41,692
- Remember, you never saw me.
- Get outta there!

471
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:44,486
Don't let 'em find me.

472
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:47,614
Come on, Eddie.
You're my only hope.

473
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:51,493
Open up in the name of the law,

474
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:54,913
P-p-please, Eddie, You know
there's no justice for toons anymore,

475
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:57,791
If the weasels get their hands on me,

476
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:00,419
I'm as good as Dipped.

477
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:02,421
Don't make us play rough, Valiant,

478
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:05,007
We just want the rabbit,

479
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,509
What're we gonna do, Eddie?
What're we gonna do?

480
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:10,220
- What are we gonna do?
-

481
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,890
What's all this "we" stuff?
They just want the rabbit.

482
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,695
Looks like they gave us the slip, huh, Boss?

483
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,990
Nah. Valiant's got him stashed somewhere.

484
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:33,994
Hold it right there.

485
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:39,208
Hello, boys.
I didn't hear you come in.

486
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,211
Okay, wise guy.

487
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:45,297
- Where's the rabbit?
- Haven't seen him.

488
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:50,010
- What's in there?
- My lingerie.

489
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:52,012
Geez, Valiant.

490
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,312
Search the place, boys.

491
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:03,190
And leave no stone "interned".

492
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:07,611
Look, Valiant, we got a reliable
tip-off the rabbit was here.

493
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:10,197
And it was "corrugated" by several others.

494
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:13,992
So cut the bull schtick.

495
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:18,413
You keep talkin' like that, and
I'm gonna have to wash your mouth out.

496
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:32,219
Stop that laughing!

497
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:38,308
Stop that laughin'!

498
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:42,104
You know what happens
when you can't stop laughin'.

499
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:48,902
One of these days,
you're gonna die laughin'.

500
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:54,283
As for you, Valiant, step outta line...

501
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:59,121
and we'll hang you
and your laundry out to dry.

502
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:05,919
Come on, boys.
Let's am-scray.

503
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:09,506
They're gone.

504
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,010
Jeepers, Eddie, that was swell.
You saved my life.

505
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:15,512
How can I ever repay ya?

506
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:21,602
Blecch! For starters,
don't ever kiss me again.

507
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:26,315
Will you stop kickin' me?

508
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:28,317
Stop kickin' me.

509
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:31,904
Dolores.

510
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:34,698
Dolores. Dolores!

511
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:42,122
Hey, Eddie, you made the front page today,

512
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:44,791
- Yeah, I guess I made some ink.
- And what ink.

513
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:47,794
Come on, Eddie.


514
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,009
So tell me, Eddie,

515
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:58,222
is that a rabbit in your pocket,
or are you just happy to see me?

516
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:01,016
Cut the comedy, Dolores.
I've had a very hard day.

517
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:04,603
- I gotta get outta these cuffs.
- Oh, swell.

518
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:06,605
Whew!

519
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:09,107
Jeepers, Eddie, That almost killed me,

520
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:13,612
- Ow.
- Boy, what is this?
Some kind of a secret room?

521
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,114
It's a rotgut room,
hold over from Prohibition.

522
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:19,701
Oh, I get it, a speak easy.
A gin mill. A hooch parlor.

523
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:21,703
- Tools are up here, Eddie.
- Look at this!

524
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:23,997
- Aah!
- It's a spy hole.

525
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:26,792
Jeepers, Eddie,
this'd be a great place to hide.

526
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:31,213
- Crazy toons. Oof!
- Watch your head.

527
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:35,884
I thought you said
you'd never take another toon case.

528
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:38,512
- What'd you have, a change of heart?
- Nothin's changed.

529
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:41,807
Somebody's made a patsy outta me,
and I'm gonna find out why.

530
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:51,900
Hold still, will ya?

531
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,988
- Does this help?
- Yeah, thanks.

532
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:03,996
Do you mean to tell me that you could have
taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?

533
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:08,208
- No, not at any time. Only when it was funny.
- Get outta here!

534
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:11,503
Come on, Eddie.
Where's your sense of humor?

535
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:14,298
He always this funny, or only
on days when he's wanted for murder?

536
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:16,300
Listen.
My "silosophy" is this.

537
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:19,219
If you don't have a good sense
of humor, you're better off dead.

538
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:22,598
You just may get your wish unless
I can figure out what happened to this.

539
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:24,600
What is it, Eddie?

540
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:27,102
Just look at it,

541
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:29,021
- Mr. Acme's will.
- Yeah,

542
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:33,317
And I think Maroon played the part of sound
mind, and your wife, the sound body.

543
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,111
- Why, I resent that innuendo.
- What's the scheme, Eddie?

544
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:39,406
- I don't think they got to the will.
- But how do you know?

545
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:42,409
Because they were still lookin'
for it after they killed him.

546
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:44,703
Anything I can do?

547
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:47,289
Maybe you could go downtown
and check the probate.

548
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:49,291
Yeah, check the probate.

549
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:51,793
Why, my Uncle Thumper had
a problem with his probate.

550
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:55,923
And he had to take these
big pills and drink lots of water.

551
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:59,009
Not prostate, you idiot.
Probate.

552
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:01,011
Let me get this straight.

553
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:03,222
You think that my boss, R.K. Maroon,

554
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:06,016
dropped a safe on Marvin Acme's head...

555
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:08,393
so that he could get his hands on Toontown?

556
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,521
Yep.

557
00:46:10,604 --> 00:46:13,023
That's my hunch.

558
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:17,110
Uh, can he stay here for a couple of days?

559
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:20,113
Not gonna do anything crazy, is he?

560
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:28,789
- Where are you goin'?
- Back to the office,

561
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:34,586
Mr, Valiant? Mr, Valiant?

562
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:43,720
You've got the wrong idea
about me, Mr, Valiant,

563
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:46,515
I'm a pawn in this, just like Roger.

564
00:46:46,515 --> 00:46:49,810
Can you help me find him?
Just name your price.

565
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,812
And I'll pay it.

566
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:53,814
Yeah. I'll bet you would.

567
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:57,317
You gotta have the rabbit
to make the scam work.

568
00:46:57,401 --> 00:47:01,113
No, no, no. I love my husband.
You've got me all wrong.

569
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:04,825
You don't know how hard
it is being a woman...

570
00:47:04,908 --> 00:47:06,785
looking the way I do.

571
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,787
Yeah, well,

572
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:12,499
you don't know how hard it is being a man...

573
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:15,502
looking at a woman looking the way you do.

574
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:19,506
I'm not bad.
I'm just drawn that way.

575
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:27,514
Weren't you the one I caught playin'
patty-cake with Old Man Acme?

576
00:47:27,598 --> 00:47:31,101
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant.
You were set up to take those pictures.

577
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:34,688
- What are you talkin' about?
- Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme.

578
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:36,899
I didn't want to have
anything to do with it.

579
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:40,194
But he said, if I didn't pose
for those patty-cake pictures,

580
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,698
Roger would never work in this town
again. I couldn't let that happen.

581
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:48,410
I'd do anything for my husband, Mr. Valiant.

582
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:51,622
- Anything.
- What a wife.

583
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:55,501
I'm desperate, Mr. Valiant.
Can't you see how much I need you?

584
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:58,504
Dabblin' in water colors, Eddie?

585
00:47:59,796 --> 00:48:02,424
Well.


586
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:05,802
Sorry.


587
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:09,806
Good-bye, Eddie.
My offer stands firm.

588
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:12,518
Think about it.


589
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:23,195
Well!

590
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,490
Do you want to tell me what she was
doing with her arms around you?

591
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:28,992
Probably lookin' for a good place
to stick a knife.

592
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:32,788
- Oh, come on, Eddie.
I caught you with your pants down!
- Yeah, but...

593
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:34,623
Dolores, come...

594
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:39,711
Come on, Dolores.

595
00:48:39,711 --> 00:48:42,297
You don't believe a painted hussy
like that could turn my head.

596
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:44,424
She's just tryin' to get
her hands on the rabbit.

597
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:46,593
That's not all she's trying
to get her hands on.

598
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:49,596
Now look, Dolores, listen.
Listen to me.

599
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:53,100
Look, I want you to go out. I want you
to buy yourself a new swimsuit.

600
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:55,102
'Cause you and me are goin' to Catalina.

601
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:58,814
- I'm on the verge of wrappin' up this case.
- No, you're not, Eddie.

602
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:02,317
That's what I came to tell you.
I stopped by Probate.

603
00:49:02,401 --> 00:49:06,113
Maroon's not after Toontown,
like you thought.

604
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,991
It's Cloverleaf that wants
to get their hands on Toontown.

605
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:10,993
They put in the highest bid.

606
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:13,912
And unless Mr. Acme's will shows up
by midnight tonight,

607
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:16,498
Cloverleaf is gonna own Toontown.

608
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:19,126
What? At midnight tonight?

609
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:21,086
That's right.

610
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:26,091
First they buy the Red Car. Then they
want to get their hands on Toontown.

611
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:28,594
- I don't get it.
- Shh!

612
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:31,096
Roger.

613
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:36,518
The rabbit. Get the Judge.

614
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,521
#A joke
Don't sit there on your brain#

615
00:49:39,605 --> 00:49:43,901
 Nice shirt.
Who's your tailor, Quasimodo?

616
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:47,404
# My buddy's Eddie V.
A sourpuss, you'll see #

617
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:50,824
# But when I'm done he'll need no gun
'Cause a joker he will be #

618
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:54,620
# C, D, E, F, G, H, I #

619
00:49:54,703 --> 00:49:58,999
# I love to raise some Cain
Believe me, it's no strain #

620
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:00,918
# It feels so great
to smash a plate #

621
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:03,712
#And look, there is no pain
No pain #

622
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:05,589
- # No pain, no pain #
- Ow!

623
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:09,301
#No pain, no pain, no...#

624
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:12,804
Oh!

625
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:17,017
Eddie, what are ya... Yah!

626
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,312
Hey, who turned out the lights?

627
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:23,106
I can't see a thing.
What's goin' on?

628
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,400
You crazy rabbit,

629
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:27,986
I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.

630
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:30,989
- And what are you doin'?
Singin' and dancin'!
-

631
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:35,911
But I'm a toon. Toons are
supposed to make people laugh.

632
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:40,415
- Sit down!
- You don't understand.
Those people needed to laugh.

633
00:50:40,499 --> 00:50:42,918
Yeah, and when they're done laughing,
they'll call the cops.

634
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:45,295
That guy, Angelo,
would rat on you for a nickel.

635
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:47,923
Not Angelo.
He'd never turn me in.

636
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:50,926
- Why? Because you made him laugh?
- That's right.

637
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:54,012
A laugh can be a very powerful thing.

638
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:57,808
Why, sometimes in life,
it's the only weapon we have.

639
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,893
- Laughter is the most im...
- Shh.

640
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:03,897
Ix-nay. Ix-nay.

641
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:12,406
I'm looking for a murderer.

642
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:26,587
A rabbit.

643
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:31,717
A toon rabbit...

644
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,305
about yea... big.

645
00:51:36,305 --> 00:51:39,892
Look, there's no rabbit here.

646
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:41,894
So don't harass my customers.

647
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:46,523
I didn't come here to harass.
I came here to reward.

648
00:52:21,517 --> 00:52:24,895
Hey. I seen a rabbit.

649
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,689
Where?

650
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:29,691
Ya see?

651
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:39,201
- Where?
- He's right here in the bar.

652
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:48,627
Well, say hello, Harvey.

653
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:57,010
I told ya so.

654
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:22,202
" Merry-Go-Round Broke Down ".

655
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:28,208
Quite a loony selection for
a group of drunken reprobates.

656
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:36,717
He's here!

657
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:44,516
- Stop that laughing!
-

658
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:50,898
Have you forgotten what happened last time?

659
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:54,109
If you don't stop this laughing,
you're gonna endup dead,

660
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:56,695
just like your idiot hyena cousins!

661
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:00,824
Hey, Boss, you want we should
"disresemble" the place?

662
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:02,826
No, Sergeant.

663
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:06,288
Disassembling the place won't be necessary.

664
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:10,918
The rabbit is going to come right to me.

665
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:15,923
- Gee.
- No toon,

666
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:20,427
can resist the old
shave-and-a-haircut trick.

667
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:30,604
I don't know who's toonier, you or Doom.

668
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:33,106
Roger.

669
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:38,195
Ro... Roger!

670
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:42,991
Roger, no.

671
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:48,205
Roger, don't, Roger,

672
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:52,793
# Shave and a haircut #

673
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:57,589
#Two bits #

674
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:05,597
Hey, Judge, what should we do
with the wallflower?

675
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:07,891
We'll see to him later.

676
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:12,104
Right now, I feel like
dispensing some justice.

677
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:14,523
Bring me some Dip.

678
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:24,908
Does the Condemned have anything to say
before his sentence is carried out?

679
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,994
Why, yeah...

680
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:30,914
Wah!

681
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,293
Dolores, bourbon.
And make it a double.

682
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:36,920
Fine time for a drink, Eddie.

683
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:40,507
- Maybe you'd like a bowl
of pretzels to go with it!
- Just pour the drink, Dolores.

684
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,807
Hey, Judge?

685
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:51,310
Don't a dyin' rabbit deserve a last request?

686
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:54,104
Yeah, Noseplugs would be nice!

687
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:56,815
I think you want a drink.

688
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:00,694
How 'bout it, Judge?

689
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:02,696
Well, why not?

690
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:05,699
I don't mind prolonging the execution.

691
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:08,994
- Happy trails.
- No thanks, Eddie. I'm tryin' to cut down.

692
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,496
- Drink the drink.
- But I don't want the drink.

693
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:13,916
- He doesn't want the drink.
- He does!
- I don't.

694
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:15,292
- You do. You do.
- I don't. I don't.

695
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:18,295
- You do. You don't,
- I don't. I do,

696
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:20,923
- You don't. You don't.
- I do.

697
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:25,093
Listen, when I say, "I do",
that means I do!

698
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:05,008
Gotcha, kid.

699
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:12,307
Come on, Eddie, let's get outta here!

700
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:14,726
Move it, pops.
Yikes!

701
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:17,729
That was quick thinkin', Eddie.

702
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:20,607
Nothin' like usin' the ol' spine flower,
the wise noodle, the...

703
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:24,319
- Roger! Let's use this.
- Yah!

704
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:27,906
- Let's get outta here.
What're you waitin' for?
- There's no damn key.

705
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,492
Hey, you weasels,
lemme outta here, will ya?

706
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:34,621
- Come on, I gotta make a livin',
- Benny, is that you?

707
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:36,790
No, it's Eleanor Roosevelt,

708
00:57:36,915 --> 00:57:39,293
Come on, Roger, get me outta here,

709
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:43,422
Eddie, we got ourselves a ride.
Open the doors!

710
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,305
- Whoo!
- Ahh, that's better.

711
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,224
I can't believe they locked me up
for drivin' on the sidewalk.

712
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:56,810
Come on, Eddie.
Get in.

713
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:58,812
It was just a couple of miles.

714
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:00,898
- I'll drive.
- But I wanna drive.

715
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:03,400
No, I'll drive.
I'm the cab.

716
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,195
Outta my way, pencil-neck!

717
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,197
How about this weather, huh?

718
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:11,491
It never rains.

719
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:13,827
They sprung the cab.
Let's go.

720
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:17,623
And how about those Brooklyn Dodgers?
Are they bums, or what?

721
00:58:17,623 --> 00:58:19,917
Move over, I'm drivin'.

722
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:24,129
Benny, Eddie, we got company!

723
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:28,217
- Would you look at these two...
Excuse me, ladies.

724
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,595
- Now that's what I call
a couple of road hogs.

725
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,305
- I'm gonna blow his head off.

726
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:38,310
Benny, look out for the Red Car!

727
00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:45,317
Whoa!

728
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,403
Benny, there's cops right behind us!

729
00:58:48,403 --> 00:58:51,031
Not for long, Roger.

730
00:58:51,198 --> 00:58:53,992
Now they're right in front of us.

731
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:58,121
Eddie, we're goin' backwards.
Turn us around!

732
00:58:58,205 --> 00:59:01,625
Gimme the wheel.
Gimme the wheel!

733
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:06,421
The cops are still on our tail.

734
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:08,715
I know the cops are on our tail.
What do you think I am, bli... Benny!

735
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:13,428
Pull the lever!

736
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:15,222
- Which one?
- Which one?

737
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:17,891
- "Which one"?
-

738
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:20,602
I'm gonna ram 'em.

739
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:25,607
Whoa!

740
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:28,110
I'm gettin' too old for this.

741
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:39,496
- Jumpin' jeepers.
- Hey, Roger, what do you call
the middle of a song?

742
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:43,500
Gee, I don't know...
A bridge! Aah!

743
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:46,712
Well, fellas, where can I drop ya?

744
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:49,715
- Somewhere we can hide.
- I got just the place.

745
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:54,720
And incidentally, if you should ever
need a ride, just stick out your thumb.

746
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:57,598
Hey, share the road, will ya, lady?

747
00:59:57,723 --> 01:00:02,311
Ah, now that wasn't so bad, was it?

748
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:18,493
Boy, did you see that?

749
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:20,704
Nobody takes a wallop like Goofy.

750
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:24,208
What timing. What finesse.
What a genius.

751
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:28,212
Ouch!

752
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:31,423
We're supposed to be hiding.
What's wrong with you?

753
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:33,425
Ow. What's wrong with you?

754
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:36,303
You're the only person
in this theater that isn't laughing.

755
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:39,806
Is there nothing that can
permeate your impervious puss?

756
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:42,017
Hey, Eddie.


757
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,019
Boy, nothin'.

758
01:00:44,102 --> 01:00:48,899
What could have possibly happened to
you to turn you into such a sourpuss?

759
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:50,901
You wanna know?

760
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:53,904
I'll tell you.
A toon killed my brother.

761
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:55,906
A toon? No.

762
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:59,493
That's right, a toon.


763
01:00:59,493 --> 01:01:03,330
We were investigating a robbery
of the First National Bank of Toontown.

764
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:06,792
Back in those days,
me and Teddy liked workin' Toontown.

765
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,920
Thought it was a lot of laughs.

766
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:13,924
Anyway, this guy...

767
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:17,094
got away with a zillion simoleons.

768
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:23,725
We trailed him to a little dive
down on Yockster Street.

769
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:25,727
We went in.

770
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:29,606
Only he got the drop on us.

771
01:01:29,606 --> 01:01:32,109
Literally.

772
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:35,195
Dropped a piano on us from 15 stories.

773
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:41,118
Broke my arm.
Teddy never made it.

774
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:45,706
I never did find out who that guy was.

775
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:50,627
All I rememberwas, he was
standin' over me, laughin',

776
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:53,922
with those burnin' red eyes...

777
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:56,425
and that high, squeaky voice.

778
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:01,597
He disappeared into Toontown after that.

779
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:06,602
No wonder you hate me.

780
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:10,606
If a toon killed my brother,
I'd hate me too.

781
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:13,901
Come on, don't cry.
I don't hate ya.

782
01:02:14,026 --> 01:02:15,903
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

783
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:18,030
You do hate me.

784
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:21,533
Otherwise you wouldn't have
yanked my ears all those times.

785
01:02:21,533 --> 01:02:24,119
All right, I'm...
I'm sorry I yanked your ears.

786
01:02:24,203 --> 01:02:26,914
All the times you yanked my ears?

787
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:29,416
All the times I yanked your ears.

788
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:31,502
Apology accepted.

789
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:33,712
Put 'er there, pal.
I feel bet...

790
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:37,424
Oh, boy, I hope it's another cartoon!

791
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:41,303
Jeepers, another stupid newsreel.

792
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:44,097
I hate the news.

793
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,308
So you got all my stuff?

794
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:51,313
Yes. It's all packed up in the car outside.

795
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:56,109
Would have been here right after you
called, but I had to shake the weasels.

796
01:02:56,193 --> 01:03:01,114
Yeah. I'm sorry
about the trouble in the bar.

797
01:03:01,198 --> 01:03:04,910
Well, hell, stuffing olives
for a livin' wasn't for me anyway.

798
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:08,205
Dolores?

799
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:13,919
You ought to find yourself a good man.

800
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:20,133
But I already have a good man.

801
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:29,518
P-p-please, don't mind me.

802
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:34,022
You better get going, Eddie.

803
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,694
A near miss,

804
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:41,530
But this miss says,
that's as good as a smile,

805
01:03:41,613 --> 01:03:44,032
California Cloverleaf...

806
01:03:44,116 --> 01:03:47,619
I'm glad Teddy's not here to see me runnin'
away with my tail between my legs.

807
01:03:47,703 --> 01:03:51,206
It's not so bad once you get used to it,

808
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:53,917
The Pacific Red Cartrolley line,

809
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:56,628
and the venerated Maroon Cartoon Studios,

810
01:03:56,712 --> 01:03:59,923
Here R,K, Maroon is seen
clinching the deal,

811
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:02,634
with Cloverleaf's bankers and execs,

812
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:06,221
in one of the biggest real estate
deals ever in California history,

813
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:08,932
- That's it!
- Three and a half million dollars for a...

814
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:11,018
That's the connection!

815
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:22,404
Let's forget it, There's nobody here,

816
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:24,406
Is that it, or are you scared?

817
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:27,701
P-p-please! Me scared?
Don't be ridiculous.

818
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:32,414
When you called Maroon,
you told him you had the will.

819
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:35,918
But you don't.
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.

820
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:38,295
He might try to kill ya.

821
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,422
I can handle a Hollywood cream puff.

822
01:04:40,422 --> 01:04:43,634
I just don't want the odds to change.
You cover my back.

823
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:48,096
And if you hear or see anything,
beep the horn twice.

824
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:51,225
Yeah, that's it.
Beep the horn twice. Cover your back.

825
01:04:51,308 --> 01:04:55,896
Boy, I'm ready. Dukes up,
eyes peeled, ears to the ground.

826
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:59,900
Why, nobody gets the drop on Roger Rabbit.

827
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:23,215
- Aah!
- What's up, doc?

828
01:05:23,215 --> 01:05:25,300
Valiant, what are you tryin' to do,
give me a heart attack?

829
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:27,803
You need a heart
before you can have an attack.

830
01:05:27,803 --> 01:05:31,723
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ya got the will?
- Sure.

831
01:05:31,807 --> 01:05:33,725
I got the will.

832
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:38,021
Question is, do you have the way?

833
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:40,732
'Cause I can tell you now,
it ain't gonna come cheap.

834
01:05:40,816 --> 01:05:43,527
You got a lot of brass,
coming up here by yourself.

835
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,529
Who said I'm here by myself?

836
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:59,626
Lemme see that will.

837
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,920
- I told you I got it.
- I wanna see it now!

838
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,422
- I told you I got it.
- I wanna see it now!

839
01:06:06,133 --> 01:06:10,429
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways"?

840
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:13,599
- This supposed to be a joke?
- No. This is.

841
01:06:18,729 --> 01:06:20,606
Get up. Come on.

842
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:23,609
What are you gonna do to me, Valiant?

843
01:06:23,734 --> 01:06:27,613
I'm gonna listen to you spin
the Cloverleaf scenario,

844
01:06:27,696 --> 01:06:31,700
the story of greed, sex and murder.

845
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:35,704
And the parts that I don't like,
I'm gonna edit out.

846
01:06:35,704 --> 01:06:39,124
You got it all wrong.
I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer!

847
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:41,418
- Everybody's gotta have a hobby.
-

848
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:45,130
Oh, stop it.
Stop it! Stop it!

849
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:48,634
The truth is, I had a chance
to sell my studio.

850
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:51,803
But Cloverleaf wouldn't buy my property
unless Acme sold 'em his.

851
01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:53,805
The stubborn bastard wouldn't sell,

852
01:06:53,931 --> 01:06:56,934
so I was gonna blackmail Acme with
pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.

853
01:06:57,017 --> 01:07:00,896
Blackmail, that's all,
I've been around toons all my life,

854
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:04,024
- I didn't want to see 'em destroyed!
- Toons destroyed?

855
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:06,318
- Why?
- If I tell ya, I'm a dead man,

856
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:09,905
- You're a dead man if you don't tell me.
- Unless Acme's will shows...

857
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:15,202
by midnight tonight, Toontown's
gonna bel and for the free... Aah!

858
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:40,811
Roger!

859
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:49,630
- What?
- What in Sam Hill?

860
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:54,009
Eddie Valiant.
Well, you're a sight for sore eyes.

861
01:08:54,134 --> 01:08:57,930
- I ain't seen you to nigh onto five years.
- Where ya been?

862
01:08:58,013 --> 01:09:00,015
Drunk.

863
01:09:00,098 --> 01:09:02,434
Feelin' frisky tonight, fellas?

864
01:09:02,518 --> 01:09:04,311
Yeah!

865
01:09:04,436 --> 01:09:06,897
Let's go.

866
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:10,234
Yahoo!

867
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,628
# Smile
Darn ya, smile #

868
01:10:11,712 --> 01:10:17,217
#You know this old world
is a great world after all #

869
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:21,138
# Smile
Darn ya, smile #

870
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:26,435
#And right away watch
Lady Luck pay you a call #

871
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:31,023
#Things are never
black as they are painted #

872
01:10:31,106 --> 01:10:35,319
- #Time for you and joy to get acquainted #
- Hi, Eddie.

873
01:10:35,402 --> 01:10:39,406
Hi, Eddie. Hi, Eddie.
Bye, Eddie.

874
01:10:51,335 --> 01:10:54,713
Tallyho! Tallyho!


875
01:11:05,516 --> 01:11:07,518
Get outta here.

876
01:11:18,028 --> 01:11:20,322
Going up, sir.

877
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:23,700
Yah!

878
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:28,330
Mind the step, sir.

879
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:31,708
Hold on, sir.

880
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:34,711
Yah!

881
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:40,801
Your floor, sir.

882
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:45,222
Have a good day, sir.

883
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:51,311
Ah, Gotcha,

884
01:11:55,315 --> 01:11:57,901
A man!

885
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:07,119
Yoo-hoo, lover-boy!

886
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:09,329
It's Lena Hyena!

887
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:14,918
Aah!

888
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:18,630
Oh, no!

889
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:29,725
- Oh, wook, piggies!
- Hi, Tweety.

890
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:31,935
This little piggy went to market.

891
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:34,313
- This little piggy stayed home.
- No.

892
01:12:34,313 --> 01:12:36,607
This little piggy had roast beef.

893
01:12:36,732 --> 01:12:40,027
- And this little piggy had...
- Aah!

894
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:42,029
Uh-oh. Ran outta piggies.

895
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:45,407
Yah!

896
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:50,329
Eh, what's up, doc?
Jumpin' without a parachute?

897
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:52,331
- Kinda dangerous, ain't it?
- Yeah.

898
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:55,834
- Yeah, you could get killed.

- You guys got a spare?

899
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:58,003
- Uh, Bugs does.
- Yeah?

900
01:12:58,128 --> 01:13:00,005
Yeah, but I don't think you want it.

901
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,132
- I do, I do. Give it to me.
- Gee.

902
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:04,426
- Better let him have it, Bugs.
- Okay, doc.

903
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:08,138
- Whatever you say. Here's the spare.
- Thank you.

904
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:14,436
Aw, no! Ahh!

905
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:18,315
- Aw, poor fella. Ha, ha.
- Yeah. Ain't I a stinker?

906
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:23,529
- My man!

907
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:30,536
Come to Lena!

908
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:40,212
Toons. Gets 'em every time.

909
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:00,732
- Gesund heit.
- Thank you.

910
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:02,609
Valiant.

911
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:10,617
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.

912
01:14:10,617 --> 01:14:14,204
- Behind you!

913
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:17,708
- Drop it, lady.
- I just saved your life,
and you still don't trust me?

914
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:21,336
- I don't trust anybody or anything.
- Not even your own eyes?

915
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:25,632
That's the gun that killed R,K, Maroon,
And Doom pulled the trigger,

916
01:14:25,716 --> 01:14:29,636
- Doom?
- I followed him to the studio.
But I was too late to stop him.

917
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,930
That's right, You'll never stop me!

918
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:35,434
- You're dead! You're all dead!
- Doom!

919
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:40,439
- Which way'd he go?
- Well, I don't know...

920
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:43,817
- But... He went that away.
- Let's go!

921
01:14:43,817 --> 01:14:47,029
- Dumdums. Yeah.
- Come on.

922
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:50,115
Oh, no. Where's Roger?

923
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:54,203
- Roger? He chickened out on me,
back at the studio.
- No, he didn't.

924
01:14:54,328 --> 01:14:57,915
I hit him on the head
with a frying pan and put him in the trunk,
so he wouldn't get hurt.

925
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,000
Makes perfect sense.

926
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,503
We're obviously not going anywhere
in my car, Let's take yours,

927
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:07,216
I got a feeling somebody already did.

928
01:15:07,299 --> 01:15:09,927
From the looks of it, I'd say it was Roger,

929
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:12,638
My honey-bunny was never
very good behind the wheel.

930
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:16,308
- A better lover than a driver, huh?
- You'd better believe it, buster.

931
01:15:16,308 --> 01:15:18,310
Uh-oh. It's the weasels.

932
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:20,312
- This way. We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
- No, wait.

933
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:22,314
No, no.
Gingerbread Lane's this way.

934
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:26,235
So Valiant, you call a cab, or what?

935
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:30,405
Hubba, hubba, hubba.
Allow me, madam-oiselle.

936
01:15:33,116 --> 01:15:35,327
So how long have you known it was Doom?

937
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:38,121
Before poor Marvin Acme was killed,
he confided in me...

938
01:15:38,205 --> 01:15:41,917
that Doom wanted to get his hands on
Toontown, and he wouldn't stop at anything.

939
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,920
- So he gave you the will for safekeeping?
- That's what he told me.

940
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:48,507
Except when I opened the envelope, there
was only a blank piece of paper inside.

941
01:15:48,632 --> 01:15:51,301
- Huh. A joker to the end.
- So where to, already?

942
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:54,638
- My meter's runnin'.
- I have to find my darling husband,

943
01:15:54,721 --> 01:15:56,640
I'm so worried about him.

944
01:15:56,723 --> 01:16:00,602
- Seriously, what do you see in that guy?
- He makes me laugh.

945
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:14,116
Whoa, I've been Dipped!

946
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:22,624
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
What an unfortunate accident.

947
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:25,419
Nothing more treacherous
than a slippery road,

948
01:16:25,502 --> 01:16:29,423
- especially when driving
in a maniacal toon vehicle.
-

949
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,719
- Good work, Boss.
-

950
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:36,430
Don't just stand there.
Help them.

951
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:39,433
- Put them in my car,
- Follow me,

952
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:43,020
I think they'll enjoy attending
the ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.

953
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:45,314
Come on, you mugs,

954
01:16:57,701 --> 01:17:01,121
We searched Valiant, Boss.
The will ain't on 'im.

955
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:03,040
Then frisk the woman!

956
01:17:03,123 --> 01:17:05,918
I'll handle this one.

957
01:17:11,215 --> 01:17:15,010
- Nice booby trap.

958
01:17:22,601 --> 01:17:25,103
Do they have the will, or not?

959
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:27,314
- Nah, just this stupid love letter.
- No matter,

960
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:32,110
I doubt if that will is going to show up
in the next 15 minutes, anyway.

961
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:35,906
- What happens in the next 15 minutes?
- Toontown will be legally mine,

962
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:38,116
lock, stock and barrel.

963
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:46,542
Benny, is that you?

964
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:51,213
No, it's Shirley Temple.
Ahh! Oh! Eee!

965
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:53,215
Jumpin' jeepers, what happened?

966
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,927
Doom grabbed your wife and Valiant
and took 'em to the Acme Factory.

967
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:59,930
The Acme Factory?
I know where that is. Get in.

968
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:02,808
Move over, Rog. You've done
enough drivin' for one night.

969
01:18:04,726 --> 01:18:08,730
- Duh, Toontown right on
the other side of the wall, Boss.

970
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,942
You see, Mr, Valiant, the
successful conclusion of this case,

971
01:18:12,025 --> 01:18:15,904
draws the curtains on my career
as a jurist in Toontown.

972
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:19,616
I'm retiring to take a new role
in the private sector.

973
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:23,412
- That wouldn't be Cloverleaf
Industries, by any chance, eh?
- Uh-uh.

974
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:26,623
You're looking at the sole stockholder.

975
01:18:31,336 --> 01:18:34,631
Benny, you go for the cops.
I'm gonna save my wife.

976
01:18:34,715 --> 01:18:37,926
Be careful with that gun.
This ain't no cartoon, you know.

977
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:40,512
This is no way to make a livin'.

978
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:45,309
Wouldn't you know, locked.

979
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:47,436
Whoa!

980
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:57,613
Can you guess what this is?

981
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:04,119
Oh, my God, it's Dip!

982
01:19:04,203 --> 01:19:08,832
That's right, my dear. Enough to Dip
Toontown off the face of the earth!

983
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:14,922
Vehicle of my own design,

984
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:18,008
Five thousand gallons of heated Dip...

985
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:22,304
pumped at enormous velocity
through a pressurized water cannon.

986
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:26,934
Toontown will be erased
in a matter of minutes,

987
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:33,232
 I suppose you think no one's
going to notice Toontown's disappeared?

988
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:36,235
Who's got time to wonder what happened
to some ridiculous talking mice...

989
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:40,531
- when you're driving by
at 75 miles an hour?
- What are you talking about?

990
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:43,617
- There's no road past Toontown.
- Not yet,

991
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:47,120
Several months ago, I had the good
providence to stumble upon...

992
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,831
this plan of the City Council's,

993
01:19:49,831 --> 01:19:52,626
a construction plan of epic proportions.

994
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:57,130
- They are calling it a freeway.
- "Freeway"?

995
01:19:57,214 --> 01:20:00,634
What the hell's a freeway?

996
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:03,929
Eight lanes of shimmering cement
running from here to Pasadena.

997
01:20:04,012 --> 01:20:06,139
Smooth, safe, fast.

998
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:09,017
Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.

999
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:13,105
So that's why you killed Acme
and Maroon? For this freeway?

1000
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:16,441
- I don't get it.
- Of course not. You lack vision.

1001
01:20:16,525 --> 01:20:21,613
I see a place where people
get on and off the freeway.

1002
01:20:21,613 --> 01:20:24,032
On and off, off and on,

1003
01:20:24,116 --> 01:20:27,119
all day, all night!

1004
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:29,329
Soon, where Toontown once stood, will be...

1005
01:20:29,413 --> 01:20:31,915
a string of gas stations;

1006
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,917
inexpensive motels;

1007
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:37,421
restaurants that serve
rapidly prepared food;

1008
01:20:37,504 --> 01:20:39,423
tire salons;

1009
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:42,134
automobile dealerships...

1010
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:45,637
and wonderful, wonderful billboards...

1011
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:49,141
reaching as far as the eye can see!

1012
01:20:50,517 --> 01:20:52,519
My God,

1013
01:20:52,603 --> 01:20:55,731
- it'll be beautiful.
- Come on,

1014
01:20:55,814 --> 01:21:00,110
Nobody's gonna drive this lousy freeway when
they can take the Red Car for a nickel.

1015
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:02,821
Oh, they'll drive.
They'll have to.

1016
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:05,407
You see, I bought the Red Car...

1017
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:08,410
so I could dismantle it.

1018
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:10,913
What the...

1019
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:20,005
- Ay, caramba!
- Aah!

1020
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:22,508
Okay, nobody move.

1021
01:21:22,633 --> 01:21:25,511
All right, weasels, grab some sky,
or I let the Judge have it.

1022
01:21:25,636 --> 01:21:27,513
You heard me.
I said, drop it.

1023
01:21:27,638 --> 01:21:30,015
- Roger, darling!
- Yes, it's me, my dearest.

1024
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:34,311
I'd love to embrace you, but first I have to
satisfy my sense of moral outrage.

1025
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:38,232
- Put the gun down, you bucktoothed fool!
- That's it, Doom,

1026
01:21:38,315 --> 01:21:40,734
Gimme another excuse
to pump ya full of lead.

1027
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:44,029
You thought you could get away
with it, didn't ya? Ha!

1028
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:48,408
We toons may act idiotic,
but we're not stupid. We demand justice.

1029
01:21:48,534 --> 01:21:52,329
Why, the real meaning of the word
probably hits you like a ton of bricks.

1030
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:56,625
Roger!

1031
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:58,919
Roger, say something.

1032
01:21:59,044 --> 01:22:01,004
Look, stars!

1033
01:22:01,004 --> 01:22:04,424
Ready when you are, Raoul,

1034
01:22:04,508 --> 01:22:09,429
Tie the lovebirds together.

1035
01:22:13,934 --> 01:22:16,311
Put them up on that hook.

1036
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:18,438
Use that escape-proof toonrope,

1037
01:22:18,522 --> 01:22:21,525
Time to kill the rabbit.

1038
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:29,032
Oh, Roger, you were magnificent,

1039
01:22:29,032 --> 01:22:31,827
- Was I really?
- Better than Goofy.

1040
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:48,343
Roger, darling,
I want you to know I love you.

1041
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:52,139
I've loved you more than any woman's
ever loved a rabbit.

1042
01:22:53,724 --> 01:22:55,642
It's over, Mr. Valiant.

1043
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:15,329
- Look out, you fools!
- Not... so... fast.

1044
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:19,333
One of these days, you idiots
are gonna laugh yourselves to death!

1045
01:23:22,544 --> 01:23:26,340
Shall I "repose" of him right now, Boss?

1046
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:30,344
Let him watch his toon friends
get Dipped. Then shoot him.

1047
01:23:32,304 --> 01:23:34,723
With pleasure,

1048
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:43,232
Everything's funny to you, ain't it,
needle-nose?

1049
01:23:43,315 --> 01:23:47,444
You got a problem with that, Valiant?

1050
01:23:47,528 --> 01:23:49,404
No.

1051
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:54,243
I just, uh, want you to know somethin'
about the guy you're gonna Dip.

1052
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:03,126
# Now, Roger is his name
Laughter is his game #

1053
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,921
# Come on, you dope
Untie his rope and watch him go insane #

1054
01:24:17,808 --> 01:24:21,019
- He's lost his mind.
- I don't think so.

1055
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:27,818
#This singin' ain't my line
It's tough to make a rhyme #

1056
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:31,113
# If I get stuck...
I'm outta luck, and... #

1057
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:33,615
#I'm running out of time#

1058
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:35,617
Thanks.

1059
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:04,229
Hey, Eddie, keep it up,

1060
01:25:04,313 --> 01:25:07,816
You're killin' 'em! You're slayin' 'em!
You're knockin' 'em dead!

1061
01:25:15,324 --> 01:25:19,244
# I'm through with takin' falls
I'm bouncin' off the walls #

1062
01:25:19,328 --> 01:25:22,039
#Without that gun I'd have some fun
I'd kick you in the... #

1063
01:25:22,122 --> 01:25:24,708
- Nose!
- "Nose"?

1064
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:26,919
That don't rhyme with "walls".

1065
01:25:27,044 --> 01:25:30,923
- No. But this does.

1066
01:25:46,939 --> 01:25:49,024
Yikes! Oh, my goodness!

1067
01:25:50,943 --> 01:25:55,239
- Jeepers, that was close!

1068
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:03,121
Bye-bye.


1069
01:26:03,205 --> 01:26:06,041
Eddie, hurry!
It's coming back!

1070
01:26:20,013 --> 01:26:22,516
Oh!

1071
01:26:22,516 --> 01:26:25,644
- Oh, no!
- This is it!

1072
01:26:25,727 --> 01:26:27,646
- No!
- This isn't it.

1073
01:26:30,607 --> 01:26:33,026
Whoa!

1074
01:26:44,121 --> 01:26:47,416
#Wicked witchcraft #

1075
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:50,836
#And although #

1076
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:56,508
# I know it's strictly taboo #

1077
01:26:57,217 --> 01:26:59,344
#When... #

1078
01:27:21,241 --> 01:27:24,036
Don't move.

1079
01:27:27,206 --> 01:27:28,916
No! No!

1080
01:28:07,913 --> 01:28:10,916
Yah!

1081
01:28:32,646 --> 01:28:34,439
Oh, no!

1082
01:28:39,236 --> 01:28:42,614
Come on, Eddie!
Quit playin' around!

1083
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:45,409
- No! Oh! No!
- Yah! P-p-please!

1084
01:28:49,538 --> 01:28:52,916
I wasn't worried.
Were you?

1085
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:13,437
- Eddie, look!
- Look!

1086
01:29:28,118 --> 01:29:31,121
Holy smoke, he's a toon!

1087
01:29:31,121 --> 01:29:34,124
- Surprised?
- Not really,

1088
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:38,420
That lamebrain freeway idea
could only be cooked up by a toon.

1089
01:29:38,545 --> 01:29:41,423
Not just any toon.

1090
01:29:58,148 --> 01:30:01,026
Remember me, Eddie?

1091
01:30:01,109 --> 01:30:04,821
When I killed your brother, I talked...

1092
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:07,616
just like this!

1093
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:18,836
Jumpin' jeepers! Oh!

1094
01:30:24,842 --> 01:30:27,427
- Yikes!
- Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!

1095
01:30:56,039 --> 01:30:58,834
Huh?

1096
01:31:31,116 --> 01:31:33,118
Good-bye, my darling.
Good-bye!

1097
01:31:38,332 --> 01:31:42,920
Oh! I think I'm gonna faint,

1098
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:54,139
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1099
01:31:54,223 --> 01:31:58,310
I'm melting!

1100
01:32:02,147 --> 01:32:05,025
I'm melting! Melting!

1101
01:32:05,025 --> 01:32:09,029
Oh, no!

1102
01:32:14,117 --> 01:32:19,122
Eddie, do something!

1103
01:32:19,248 --> 01:32:24,127
Hurry up, Eddie!
Do something!

1104
01:32:55,909 --> 01:33:00,747
Eddie, there's Dip everywhere,
How are we gonna get down?

1105
01:33:26,648 --> 01:33:29,443
Jeepers, Eddie, that was a close save.

1106
01:33:29,526 --> 01:33:32,321
I thought for sure our goose was cooked.

1107
01:33:32,446 --> 01:33:34,948
Oh!

1108
01:33:35,032 --> 01:33:37,534
My hero!

1109
01:33:37,618 --> 01:33:40,120
- Oh, honey-bunny.
- Oh, love-cup.

1110
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,915
Oh, Roger!

1111
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,834
You were a pillar of strength,

1112
01:33:49,546 --> 01:33:54,718
Sister Mary Francis!
What the hell happened in here?

1113
01:33:58,222 --> 01:33:59,848
I've been a cab for 37 years,

1114
01:33:59,848 --> 01:34:00,849
I've been a cab for 37 years,

1115
01:34:00,933 --> 01:34:03,936
and I've never seen a mess like this,

1116
01:34:03,936 --> 01:34:06,313
What was that, a rubbermask?

1117
01:34:06,438 --> 01:34:10,234
Yeah, and this is the rope
from the safe that was dropped on Acme.

1118
01:34:10,234 --> 01:34:13,820
I think your lab boys will find
that paint's a perfect match.

1119
01:34:13,946 --> 01:34:16,240
Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme.

1120
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:19,326
And R.K. Maroon and my brother.

1121
01:34:19,409 --> 01:34:23,539
That's what I call one
seriously disturbed toon.

1122
01:34:29,336 --> 01:34:32,130
Gosh, uh, I wonder who he really was.

1123
01:34:32,214 --> 01:34:35,926
- I tell you one thing, doc.
He weren't no rabbit.
- Or a duck.

1124
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:38,136
- Or a dog.
- Or a little wooden boy.

1125
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:41,223
- Or a sheep.
- Or a woodpecker.
- Or a pussy.

1126
01:34:41,348 --> 01:34:43,851
- What's that? What is that?

1127
01:34:43,934 --> 01:34:48,146
It's ink. That goof Acme squirted me
with some the other night.

1128
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:51,441
- Why it's comin' out now, I don't know,
- Here's your answer, Eddie.

1129
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:53,944
Acme Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.

1130
01:34:54,027 --> 01:34:58,031
- Boy, that Acme. What a genius!
- Applesauce!

1131
01:34:58,115 --> 01:35:01,743
If he was such a genius, why didn't he
leave his will where we could find it?

1132
01:35:01,827 --> 01:35:04,830
Without it, we're just waitin'
for another developer's wrecking ball,

1133
01:35:04,913 --> 01:35:07,332
- Roger, that love letter
you wrote to your wife...
- Yeah?

1134
01:35:07,416 --> 01:35:10,127
in the Ink and Paint Club...
why don't you read it to her now?

1135
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:12,129
Sure, Eddie.

1136
01:35:12,212 --> 01:35:14,339
"Dear Jessica, How do I love thee?

1137
01:35:14,423 --> 01:35:19,219
Let me count the ways.
I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body..."

1138
01:35:19,344 --> 01:35:21,430
- It's the will!
- Keep reading.

1139
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:24,016
"Do hereby bequeath inperpetuity,

1140
01:35:24,141 --> 01:35:28,812
the property known as Toontown to
those loveable characters, the toons!"

1141
01:35:41,325 --> 01:35:44,745
Hey, Eddie, that was a pretty
funny dance you did for the weasels.

1142
01:35:44,828 --> 01:35:47,539
do you think your days
of bein' a sourpuss are over?

1143
01:35:47,623 --> 01:35:49,541
Only time will tell.

1144
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:52,211
- Yeah, well, put it there, pal.
- Yeah.

1145
01:36:01,637 --> 01:36:05,516
Don't tell me you lost
your sense of humor already.

1146
01:36:08,727 --> 01:36:10,812
Does this answer your question?

1147
01:36:13,023 --> 01:36:17,027
- Blech! Bleah!
-

1148
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:19,446
Come on, Roger, let's go home.

1149
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:21,532
I'll bake you a carrot cake.

1150
01:36:23,742 --> 01:36:27,412
# Smile, darn ya, smile #

1151
01:36:27,412 --> 01:36:32,125
# You know this old world
is a great world after all #

1152
01:36:32,251 --> 01:36:36,547
- # Smile, darn ya, smile #
-

1153
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:42,052
# And right away watch
Lady Luck pay you a call #

1154
01:36:42,135 --> 01:36:46,723
# Things are never
black as they are painted #

1155
01:36:46,849 --> 01:36:50,227
#Time for you and joy to get acquainted #

1156
01:36:50,352 --> 01:36:52,229
Okay, m-m-move along.

1157
01:36:52,312 --> 01:36:54,940
T-T-There's nothing else to see.
That's all, folks.

1158
01:36:55,023 --> 01:36:57,526
Hmm. I like the sound of that.

1159
01:36:57,651 --> 01:37:00,445
T-T-T-T-That's all, folks!
