1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,070
OK.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,400
Jackson came over to play.

3
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,870
Superheroes!

4
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,160
I was Black Power Ranger.

5
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,590
He was Batman.

6
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,840
Jake, are you OK in there, buddy?

7
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,020
I'm OK.

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,810
Can I ask you a question?

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,180
OK! Time to hit the sack.

10
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,110
- An important question.
- There we go, big guy. Come on.

11
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,160
- Can I wear bugs?
- Bug pyjamas... are all the way downstairs.

12
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,330
But fire trucks are here.

13
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,080
- Bugs.
- Fire trucks.

14
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,750
- Bugs.
- Fire trucks.

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,750
- Bugs.
- OK, bugs.

16
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,250
I'll be right back.

17
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,100
Does it hurt to be dead?

18
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,940
- Animal.
- What did I do now?

19
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,020
- Can I tell him?
- If you wanna die.

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,700
- Well, your beer-addled sperm still work.
- Lisa!

21
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,660
- You impregnated my sister again.
- Bitch!

22
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,330
- I thought you wanted me to?
- I said ''Don't''!

23
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,600
The kid could have been born
before he'd notice.

24
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,920
- You're not pregnant.
- I feel ''Congratulations'' is more appropriate.

25
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,790
- You told her before you told me.
- She's a witch!

26
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,810
She took one look at me and guessed.

27
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,470
Say something!

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,550
Bummer.

29
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,890
Something else!

30
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,770
So... she's six weeks pregnant.
That means the baby's due in April, May...

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,120
..June. Gemini. That's cool.
Einstein was a Gemini.

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,370
- So's that Scottish gal from Garbage.
- Will you go help Jake with his pyjamas?

33
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,160
- If she's late...
- Lisa, I swear to God...

34
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,210
..start with the Dionne Warwick stuff,
I'll throw you out the fuckin' window.

35
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,170
- So please help him with the pyjamas.
- Love you, too, Tom

36
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,080
Hey, this is great. I mean it.

37
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,760
It's about time we had another kid.
I was gonna bring it up myself.

38
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,930
- Really- Absolutely!

39
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,840
- This time, you gotta take some time off.
- Please! We can't afford that!

40
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,490
- We can. I'm gonna hit the overtime again.
- I don't want you to work those hours again.

41
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,310
You come home in a trance.
You're completely useless to me.

42
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,690
I'm gonna be fine, OK?

43
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,740
I'm just gonna tell Teddy
to get somebody else for the thing.

44
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,750
- Oh, God! Oh, Tom!
- What?

45
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,080
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
No wonder you're pissed off.

46
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,550
I'm not pissed off. I just...
No, I'm... I'm not. I'm not.

47
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,620
I'm a grown man. I shouldn't be screwing
around with some shitty band anyway.

48
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,130
Hey, look, I gotta go change.
You know, put on something cool.

49
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,840
I love you.

50
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,860
I'm a happy guy.

51
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,210
You know, I'm not gonna be a lineman
forever, I promise you that.

52
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,740
Whaddaya mean?

53
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,950
I clip wire all day.
A monkey could do it.

54
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,540
Yeah, but they're gonna
move you into the office soon.

55
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:18,160
No, I meant, when we first got together, I said
a lotta stuff about what I was gonna be...

56
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,550
..and I just wanted you to know that...
I wasn't giving you some kinda line...

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,310
..that I meant it.

58
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,430
I didn't marry you because I thought
you were gonna be famous.

59
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,820
I just liked the way your ass looked in jeans.

60
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,530
I never wanted to be famous. I just...
I didn't expect to be... so...

61
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,500
What?

62
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,820
I don't know.

63
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,110
Ordinary.

64
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,950
Hang on! Hang on!

65
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,670
You know, I hope it's a girl.

66
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,250
I'm kinda sick of all these balls
around the house. Except for yours, babe.

67
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,890
What are the odds on an educated single man
being at this thing?

68
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,060
And I don't mean a GED!

69
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,770
- Does it matter if he's on the boner pill?
- I wouldn't look a gift-boner in the mouth.

70
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,480
Nice - that's very nice, Lisa

71
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,020
- Hey! How you been?
- Hey, Tom, Tom, Tommy! How ya doin'?

72
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,150
You would not believe the day I had.

73
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,450
- Take this. I'll get another.
- Thanks.

74
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,490
- Harry.
- Tom. Taking care of the place for me?

75
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,200
We're drilling holes all over your floors.
I hope you don't mind.

76
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,990
Tom, you know my squaw Sheila.
Bobby, Vanessa.

77
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,500
- Thanks for having me.
- Drink up! Take your medicine.

78
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,670
Tom, how do you like the neighbourhood?

79
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,470
I grew up in Bridgeport,
so it's not like it's a foreign country.

80
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,390
You're goddamn right.
This is the best neighbourhood in Chicago.

81
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,680
We all look out for each other. That's
saying a lot as we approach the year 2000.

82
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,900
- Are you running for mayor
- Hey, did any of you guys...

83
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,320
- ..see them crank dealers...
- What is Lenny doing here?

84
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,560
Bobby, did you tell him you had a party?

85
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,250
- Vanessa made me. We invited everybody.
- To actually invite this jack-off...

86
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,410
Oh, yeah, laugh it up.

87
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,160
When you wake up dead with your throat cut,
don't come crying to me!

88
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,050
Not attracted to.

89
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,460
Not drunk enough for.

90
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,340
Frightened by!

91
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,560
Don't touch me. I'm fine.

92
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,630
Haven't you heard about people being
operated on when they're under hypnosis?

93
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,800
Yeah, but I don't believe in any of that.

94
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,550
People who say they were hypnotised
were just playing along.

95
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,970
- Right.
- Really?

96
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,310
Then how could they have a scalpel stuck
into their throat without even bleeding?

97
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,600
- Bullshit!
- You never saw that happen!

98
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,060
- That's bullshit!
- Learn another word!

99
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,400
Yeah, what about ''narrow-minded''?

100
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,360
I saw a guy in my class get a two-inch needle
stuck into his arm by my instructor...

101
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,040
- ..when he was under hypnosis.
- Horseshit! That better, honey?

102
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,750
I saw a picture of it the next day.
It left a mark.

103
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,540
What I don't understand is
how a person that's been to college...

104
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,960
..can believe all that superstitious crap.

105
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,340
- It isn't superstitious!
- Come on!

106
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,840
- I'm practically a licensed hypnotherapist.
- ''Practically''?

107
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,380
Isn't that like saying
''I don't have a licence''? My arm!

108
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,900
This may come as a surprise to you, but just
because you lived here for your whole life...

109
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,680
..doesn't mean that there isn't
a whole larger world out there...

110
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,650
..doorways you haven't even opened, things
you wouldn't have any understanding of.

111
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,950
Doorways... OK, OK. All right, Kreskin,
prove it - hypnotise somebody.

112
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,400
- Yeah! Do me.
- No.

113
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,580
- Why not?
- For one, you're hostile.

114
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,160
I'm not hostile!
Do I seem hostile to anybody?

115
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,160
- Yeah. - Thanks for having us.
It was a great party.

116
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,090
Nah, nah, this is just getting good.
Come on, Lisa. Hypnotise me. Come on!

117
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,460
- No. You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk!

118
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,130
You're not supposed to mesmerise
somebody who's been drinking!

119
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,430
Mesmerise! No! Stop!

120
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,280
Oh, please! I'm begging you.
Educate the savages.

121
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,360
It won't work with
that kind of uncooperative attitude.

122
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,790
I swear to you, I'll follow
every instruction to the letter.

123
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,940
It still won't work.

124
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,690
Come on.

125
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,700
What's the worst that can happen?

126
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,540
- Somebody turn out the lights.
- Oh, yeah!

127
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:54,460
All right, just relax. Put your arm down.
Just rest it comfortably. Just lean back.

128
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,170
Just be very comfortable and relaxed.

129
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,380
Trust me. OK?

130
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,320
- Close your eyes.
- Certainly, Lisa.

131
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,520
Now... just listen for a moment.

132
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,070
Listen to the sounds of the room around you.

133
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,370
I don't know why, but I'm scared.

134
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,030
Now I want you to pretend
you're in a theatre.

135
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,830
A movie theatre.

136
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,710
You're the only one there.

137
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,040
It's one of those great old movie palaces.

138
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,650
When you look around,
it's a huge, empty theatre.

139
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,890
You notice that the walls of the theatre
are painted in black.

140
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,270
The seats... are covered in black.

141
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,440
And in the whole pitch-black theatre...

142
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:02,740
..there's only one thing you can see,
and that's the white screen.

143
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,910
You'll notice there are letters on the screen -
tall, thick, black letters.

144
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,590
But they're out of focus, so you drift closer
to them in your chair, trying to read them.

145
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,920
You're very comfortable now.
It's your favourite chair.

146
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,180
You're drifting closer and closer,
staring at the letters.

147
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,520
Very relaxed now.
Your legs are relaxed.

148
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,930
Your arms are limp and heavy.

149
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,100
You're almost close enough
to read the letters now.

150
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,560
They start to come into focus.

151
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,350
The letters spell ''sleep''.

152
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,100
Sleep.

153
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,250
No!

154
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,950
What the hell was that?

155
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,750
- What? What? What?
- Are you OK? You had to be faking it.

156
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,840
That was the weirdest goddamn thing
I've seen in my life!

157
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,010
Congratulations, Tom!
You're one of the lucky eight percent!

158
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,880
- You still have tears on your cheeks.
- What the hell did she do to me?

159
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,240
- Christ, I'm thirsty.
- Whaddaya mean? What eight percent?

160
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,140
There's only eight percent of the population
that's, like, highly hypnotisable.

161
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,480
Almost anybody can go under a little...

162
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,650
..but not way under -
not freaky under, like he did.

163
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,830
- How's your hand?
- Whaddaya mean?

164
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:32,160
I stuck a safety pin in your hand and asked
you to bleed on one side, but not the other.

165
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,710
- Which I can't believe you did!
- You were very cooperative.

166
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,000
It was a side of you I hadn't seen before.

167
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,210
- That happened?
- You said it didn't hurt.

168
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,800
To hell with the pin!
I wanna know more about your Joey Luca.

169
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,050
- Yeah, right!

170
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,420
- Who?
- Joey Luca is the kid who...

171
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,380
..used to pound the shit out of you
when you were 12.

172
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,520
You told us all about it. You were crying.
It was hysterical!

173
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,740
- Shut up.
- It was very moving, Tom.

174
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,680
Joey Luca! Jesus Christ,
I haven't thought about him...

175
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,570
Can we go home? I feel kinda strange.

176
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,040
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

177
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,820
Close your eyes.

178
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,790
What's the matter?

179
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,340
Don't stop.

180
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,930
- Don't stop.
- OK.

181
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,530
Jesus Christ! Oh, my God!

182
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,710
- What?
- I'm seeing things.

183
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,860
What do you mean?

184
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,460
Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
I can't right now.

185
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,460
Then you were faking it extremely well.

186
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,380
Wait. Stop, stop, stop! It's too weird.

187
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,770
Baby, that wasn't weird.
I could show you weird.

188
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,990
I felt like I was being attacked.

189
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,230
Thanks.

190
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,060
I'm sorry, I didn't...

191
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,770
I'll be right back.

192
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,920
What the fuck...

193
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,210
- Hey, Jake.
- You're awake now, Daddy.

194
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,390
Are you OK?

195
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,970
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

196
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,930
I just don't feel so good right now.

197
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,280
Don't be afraid of it, Daddy.

198
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,750
- What was it, then? An hallucination?
- Yeah, a bunch of 'em.

199
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,010
It's like all these thoughts just kept coming.
You believe this? I got seven calls.

200
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,390
Well, if it never happened before,
it had to be the hypnosis.

201
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,340
I had this headache and I was thirsty as hell.

202
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,230
Jake! I know you're not watching
that monster tape again

203
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,400
- Who was the woman?

204
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,770
I don't know. Maybe somebody I was just
remembering. She didn't look familiar.

205
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,490
- Did you fuck her?
- You gotta be kidding.

206
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,610
No. I mean, was she someone
you used to go out with?

207
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,070
You're jealous of my hallucination?
You are pregnant!

208
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:15,300
- You should call Lisa.
- No, she's the one that fucked up my brain.

209
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,470
- Then she has to unfuck it.
- Fuck! Fuck!

210
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,620
Don't swear so much!

211
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,220
Hang on, hang on!
Let me get my bearings here.

212
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:29,430
I have... I have absolutely no caffeine
in my system, you know.

213
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,940
OK. You're asking me if I gave you a post...

214
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,060
..posthypnotic suggestion.

215
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,140
Did you leave anything else behind
when you were inside my brain?

216
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,600
- Nothing!
- Tell the truth, Lisa.

217
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,700
Tom! Please, this is insulting.
You know, I have done this before.

218
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,400
OK, good. I was...
I was just making sure.

219
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,650
It was just a harmless one anyway.

220
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,870
- What?
- Did it actually work?

221
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,970
- What did you say?
- I don't wanna tell you. You're grouchy.

222
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,290
Lisa, I swear to God...!

223
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:05,090
Well, you know I've always said I think
you need to be a little more open-minded?

224
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,970
- Yeah...
- So I just said that.

225
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,130
''After you wake up, your mind will be
completely open, like an open door...

226
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,900
..open to receive everything around you.''

227
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,980
- What's that supposed to do?
- Fuck if I know! I never said it before.

228
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,930
- Why? Did something happen?
- Jesus Christ!

229
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,330
Relax. OK? I opened a door, that's all.
You know, therapists do it all the time.

230
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,740
It releases repressed memories,
whatever you got back there.

231
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:36,040
- For you, it was probably old Mannixreruns.
- I gotta get back to work.

232
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,080
OK. Alrighty, then

233
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,880
No! No more calls for Lisa!

234
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,800
- Hey, Lise, it's me.

235
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,110
Call me when you wake up. Is there any way
you could baby-sit for us on Friday?

236
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,030
I did! I told him!

237
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,410
What's your name?

238
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,200
OK.

239
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,530
..but then I gotta hear about it for a month.

240
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,790
I called everyone who could possibly do it
and no one's free.

241
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,710
Call Vanessa.

242
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,800
I said, call Vanessa and ask her about Debbie.

243
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,710
Anyway, call me back. Bye.

244
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,630
Debbie? That's the girl
who baby-sits for them?

245
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,840
Yep.

246
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,260
Oh, great idea. Pray she's free.

247
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,430
- How'd you know about Debbie?
- Samantha told me.

248
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,470
Hey, Vanessa.
Are you guys going out Friday night?

249
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,720
Hi. I'm Debbie.

250
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,480
Kozak...?

251
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,620
Tom Witzky.

252
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,990
- Hi, Debbie. I'm Maggie.
- Hi.

253
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,950
Thanks for coming. Jake's asleep already
and he hardly ever wakes up.

254
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,950
A band could play in his room
and he wouldn't hear it!

255
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,750
His room's upstairs, kitchen's back there.
Just help yourself if you want anything.

256
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,460
Here, have a seat.
This is the baby monitor.

257
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,300
It's on B in his room,
so you should hear everything.

258
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,510
- You wanna watch a movie?
- I got a book.

259
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,430
It shouldn't be later than midnight,
if that's OK.

260
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,610
- Perfect.
- Great. I'll just grab my coat.

261
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,060
Hello!

262
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,190
- Ready?

263
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,070
- Yeah. Just about.
- OK.

264
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,900
Hey. Where'd you find that girl Debbie?

265
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,910
Vanessa gave me her number.
Everybody uses her. It's cool.

266
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,950
- Another headache?
- Too much caffeine.

267
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,300
OK, let's go.

268
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,330
Bye.

269
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,480
I think that Damon kid
is doing a great job and everything...

270
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,510
..and yeah, the kid's got a decent arm,
but high-school football is about...

271
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,190
..power, it's about running the goddamn
football - it always has been.

272
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,600
What did you play in high school?

273
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,560
- Piano, mostly.
- Jesus! Sorry. Here, you want some?

274
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,160
Anyway, Adam...
and I admit that I am biased...

275
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,070
..but my kid is having a helluva season
and it's like nobody even notices.

276
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,840
If they gave him the ball,
he could break a thousand yards!

277
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,620
And that's in an eight-game season.
Jesus Christ!

278
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,920
Why don't you just lick 'em
when they walk by?

279
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,550
Frank says the average guy carries around
a hard-on two hours out of every day.

280
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,350
- Three for him.
- See, now I got a picture of that!

281
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,850
One of these days, she's gonna find
one of my .38s and pop a cap in my ass!

282
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,290
He'll stick it in a bowl of soup
if it's still warm.

283
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,080
Go! Go!

284
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,190
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

285
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,940
Over a thousand yards,
we're talking college scholarship!

286
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,740
Hey, come on...
The kid can write his own ticket.

287
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:39,150
And that's good for everybody. It's good
for the whole goddamn neighbourhood.

288
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,030
He's gonna go a helluva lot further
than lever did.

289
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Look at the quality of tail he gets. He passed
me in that department when he was 14.

290
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,250
Come on! While we're young?

291
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,820
You scared me!

292
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,120
She's downstairs, I think.

293
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,290
I don't know.
I haven't seen her yet.

294
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,500
Jake?

295
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,510
- What's the matter?
- Something's wrong.

296
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,850
What?

297
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,230
I have a secret to tell you.

298
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,200
Promise, promise, promise?

299
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,680
Samantha says it's always dark where she is.

300
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,340
Who did you say?

301
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,260
Samantha.

302
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,150
You... you talked to Samantha?

303
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,720
Yeah!

304
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,650
When?

305
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,810
All the time.

306
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,150
- Where?
- Here. In my house.

307
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,960
That's not true.

308
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,070
Go.

309
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,200
Go!

310
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,670
- It isn't true.
- I don't tell lies!

311
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,000
Samantha was here? Here, in your house?

312
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,500
- You're hurting my arm!
- Was she here?

313
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,170
- Let go of me!
- Come on, you're coming with me. Let's go.

314
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,650
She's taking him away.

315
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,900
Put me down! Put... me... down!

316
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,170
Tom!

317
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,790
Jake!

318
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,330
Jake!

319
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,930
Jake!

320
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,930
- What the hell...?
- She took him.

321
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,730
- What?
- The fucking baby-sitter.

322
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,440
Oh, my God!

323
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,010
He's not in there.

324
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,730
- Where are you going?
- I don't know!

325
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,680
He's in there.

326
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,460
- Jake!
- Daddy!

327
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,630
- That's him!
- Wait! Where do you think you're going?

328
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,710
Take it easy! Stop! Stop!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

329
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,810
- Gimme my kid.
- Tell me where she is! No!

330
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,590
You tell me where she is!
You tell me where she is!

331
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,880
- Keep your hands off her!
- Hey! Hey, hey! Everybody shut up!

332
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,470
- Are you OK?
- That girl kidnapped our son.

333
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,850
- Is that your child?
- Ask about Samantha.

334
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,140
I'm asking about the boy,
who doesn't look like he's yours!

335
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,720
- I can explain this.
- I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to her.

336
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,900
- Is that boy your child?
- No.

337
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,480
She was baby-sitting for us. We never...

338
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,780
What you've done is a felony.
You can go to jail for this!

339
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,960
- Where were you taking him?
- I wasn't taking him anywhere!

340
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:37,080
- Then why did ya bring him here?
- I wanna press charges.

341
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,740
She came here because of me.
I'm her mother.

342
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,060
- Her mother?
- When are you gonna ask about Samantha?

343
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,920
- Who?
- My oldest daughter. She ran away.

344
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,380
No, she was kidnapped,
and the little boy said he saw her!

345
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,060
We haven't heard from her in a long time.
We filed a police report.

346
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,560
- Nobody returns our phone calls.
- Jake said he talked to her.

347
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,730
He said Samantha is in their house.
Is that her?

348
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,660
- Stay away from him.
- Look at the picture.

349
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,620
- Let go of me!
- Look at the picture.

350
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,860
- This is ridiculous.
- Will you look at the picture, please?

351
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,750
- I have never seen her before in my life.
- What about you?

352
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,120
No. I'm sorry. I've never seen her.

353
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:26,040
- No... No. No, they're lying!
- You wanna file charges?

354
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,460
- Yes!
- No.

355
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,630
- What?
- Come on, let's just... forget about it.

356
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,140
Let's go home.

357
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,350
Are you nuts? What about
the next people she baby-sits for?

358
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,680
It was her. Samantha.

359
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:44,520
That girl in the picture,
she's the same girl I saw on our couch.

360
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,110
See, why... Why did you ask that girl Debbie
to baby-sit for us? Why her?

361
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,750
I couldn't find anybody else.
I was on the phone and Jake said...

362
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,120
Jake? Do you remember the other day
when we were talking in the kitchen?

363
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:09,290
I was looking for a baby-sitter, remember?
You said Samantha told you about Debbie.

364
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,540
Do you remember that?

365
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,220
Mommy's asking you a question, bud.

366
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,340
Is Samantha someone
who talks to you sometimes, Jake?

367
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:28,480
- Can you remember...
- Don't ask the boy any more questions.

368
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,690
Talk to me.

369
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,030
What did you say?

370
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,870
Jake. W-what did you say just now?

371
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,370
- Nothing.
- Let me hear that voice again.

372
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,870
- Come on. Say it again. Use that voice again.
- Tom!

373
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,720
Come... Come on, Jake. Come on.
Use the voice again.

374
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,750
- Tom!
- Make the voice again, Jake. You can do it.

375
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,640
- Tom, don't!
- How do you...

376
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,260
- Tom, please!
- It's all right! It's all right!

377
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,350
- OK!
- What are you doing? Hey! Hey!

378
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,630
I'm talking to him!

379
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,810
- Hey, what's the matter with you?
- What do you think?

380
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,600
Well, I'm just trying
to have a conversation with my kid.

381
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,820
A perfectly normal conversation
for a five-year-old

382
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,030
- Don't be afraid of it.
- Why the hell not?

383
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,320
I don't know. That's what he told me.

384
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,950
This is where it happened.
This is where I saw her.

385
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,590
- You're different. You feel different.
- I leaned back and there she was. She's 18.

386
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,460
- Longish hair. Is that what you saw?
- I wish you...

387
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,080
- Maggie, please!
- God!

388
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:36,670
Or... or maybe you don't see her?
You just hear her? Is that what it is?

389
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:40,020
- Tom, stop it!
- I need to find a way to make her come back.

390
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,560
- Maybe if I hang out here long enough...
- I'm talking to you!

391
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:47,390
..maybe she'll come back. Maybe
you could talk to her. Help me out here.

392
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:52,030
- Hey, come on! Hey! What's the problem?
- Knock it off!

393
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,860
I don't wanna talk about this
because it scares Mommy.

394
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,840
- Turn it up, man.
- What?

395
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,210
Turn it up. Up!

396
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,150
Tom is looking especially together today.

397
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,450
He grunted a very pleasant greeting
at me, actually.

398
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,750
He's becoming sort of monosyllabic.
Nothing wrong with that guy.

399
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,950
Nothing a little lithium couldn't cure!

400
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,720
- I'm a jerk. I'm sorry.
- No...

401
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,430
Are you OK?

402
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,140
Over there! In the door!

403
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,890
If you live on the base,
your room and board's covered.

404
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,110
- You still gotta get up early.
- I'll retire, make a coupla down payments.

405
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,120
When I take off the uniform,
I'm a landlord already.

406
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,950
Five years later, I got three houses.

407
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,320
- Hey. Hey, Har.
- How're ya doin'?

408
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,620
Whaddaya know
about that girl Samantha Kozak?

409
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,660
Samantha Kozak. Why do I know that name?

410
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,890
Brownish hair, 16 or 17 years old.
Used to live around here.

411
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,670
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember her, I think.
- Let's go.

412
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Hey, Kurt! Come here for a second.

413
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,330
Like he ever tells me anything, right?

414
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,140
Get over here!

415
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,640
Say, you know that Kozak girl?

416
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,730
- Debbie.
- No, no, no, the other one. Samantha.

417
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:35,480
Oh, you mean the retard.
Yeah, she ran away.

418
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,520
Yeah, that's right. I remember that.
So, what about her?

419
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,350
I just been thinking about her a lot.

420
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,110
Why?

421
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,700
Her sister baby-sat for us.

422
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,430
This is the first time
he's been out in a week.

423
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,210
He hasn't gone to work.
He sleeps 12 hours a night.

424
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:06,760
He's used up all his sick days. If he doesn't
show up on Monday, they'll dock him.

425
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,050
I can't get him more than six feet
from the couch.

426
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,940
- Why?
- That's where she appeared to him.

427
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,690
I'm not shocked that
there's another woman.

428
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,570
Of course, the fact that she's dead
gives one pause.

429
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,740
We are talking about a ghost here,
aren't we, Maggie?

430
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,960
She took off... last March.
With a black guy, I think.

431
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,050
Hey, Harry.
Did she ever live in our house?

432
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:39,420
No, no, no. I just... I just bought that one.
You're the first tenants.

433
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,970
Tom and Jake, it's like they have
this private club or something.

434
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,720
They sit in the living room and whisper,
and, as soon as I walk in, they both shut up.

435
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:53,730
You know what you need to do? Find a
young priest with smouldering good looks...

436
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,270
..who can guide you through this.

437
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,680
I'm kidding, but I'm not.

438
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,990
Look, I give Tom a lotta shit, but the truth is,
you guys are the best couple on earth.

439
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,370
This is on you now, Maggie. Get some help.
Find out why this is happening.

440
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,650
There is a reason.

441
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:15,410
You won't be the first woman who's
had to hold an insane family together.

442
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,950
Tom's not crazy.

443
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,120
Yes he is. But at least
he's getting interesting.

444
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,300
Sports flash! Sports flash!

445
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,630
211 yards rushing on Friday night.

446
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,210
That's a total of 894 yards,
with two games to go.

447
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,920
The kid needs 106 yards. That's 53 a game.

448
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,520
He could walk through the next two games
and still break a thousand!

449
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,610
- Frank, what about you? Do you know her?
- Who?

450
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,860
Tom was asking about that Kozak girl
from over by Baldwin.

451
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,480
- You remember: the one who ran away?
- The retard.

452
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,820
Shut up, Lenny. Don't use that word.

453
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,480
- He's just kinda slow.
- What? Retard?

454
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,040
Goddammit, Lenny,
shut your fuckin' pie hole!

455
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,370
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Heads up!

456
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,080
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey, hey!

457
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:09,500
Somebody's always gotta ruin it.
They can't ever just be nice.

458
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,560
Frank. What are you doing here?

459
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,820
They're gonna kill you, Tommy.

460
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,490
You and Maggie both.

461
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,140
Why would you
say something like that, Frank?

462
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,150
This is a decent neighbourhood.

463
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,100
Hey, are you OK?

464
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,150
Where's Sheila? Is she at home?

465
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,570
Listen, I'm gonna go see if Sheila's at home.

466
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,540
OK?

467
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:03,930
- In the house! Come on, both of you!

468
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,180
Come in!

469
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,730
Hi. Is your mom at home cos your dad's...

470
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,850
Hey... you wanna see what I've got?

471
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,820
Sure.

472
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,320
That's great. Is that one of your dad's?

473
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,360
Not today. Come here.

474
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,220
Why don't you just
put the gun away, Adam?

475
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,120
- Come on, man. Come here.
- Those things make me kinda nervous.

476
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,340
- Then this will make you really nervous.
- Don't do that!

477
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,670
Don't!

478
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,690
Please don't be under there.

479
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,300
Oh, boy.

480
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,360
Frank?

481
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,200
- In the house! Come on, both of you!

482
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,940
Adam!

483
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,310
Adam! Open the door!

484
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,570
Oh, my God. Oh, God!

485
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,660
Help!

486
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,040
Help!

487
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,670
Am I awake... or asleep?

488
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,840
Help!

489
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,550
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, my baby!

490
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:12,510
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Let me... Let me go!

491
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:17,560
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Is he alive? Is he alive?

492
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:22,200
Oh, my God, Adam!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

493
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,070
Adam! Adam!

494
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,500
I'm gonna take him for a walk or something.

495
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,130
- Come on, sweetie pie. Let's get your jacket.
- Where are we going?

496
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,770
- Well! Hello, there!
- Well, hello... there.

497
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,700
Listen! Music!

498
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,950
It's beautiful!

499
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,040
Hey! Jake, wait up!

500
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,600
I don't think we're supposed to be here,
sweetie. Come on, let's go. This way.

501
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,230
This place is cool!

502
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,450
Come on, honey. Let's go get some lunch.

503
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:51,090
Mom! What's this thing?

504
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:55,020
- I don't know. Let me take a look.
- It looks like some kinda stone.

505
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,220
- Either that, or it's a medal.
- Yeah, I think it is.

506
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,430
- ''Served in the...''
- Look. A flag.

507
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,860
- Everything OK?
- It's fine. Just fine.

508
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,150
We're not supposed to be here?

509
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,120
Oh, no. It's fine. Really.

510
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,830
OK. See you later.

511
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,450
The boy's got the eyes on him, doesn't he?

512
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,380
X-ray.

513
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,800
Not you, though.

514
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,760
Possibly Daddy?

515
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,140
They're not the only ones.

516
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:44,400
Tell Daddy to come by and see me
a little later tonight.

517
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,730
He might learn a few things.

518
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,740
Bye, Jake.

519
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:02,840
Bye, Neil.

520
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,290
His name is Neil.

521
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,000
Try that, Daddy.

522
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,510
Why do I know that song?

523
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,800
I'll be home right after the movie.

524
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,510
I know it. I know it!

525
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,970
I said, I won't be late.

526
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,150
OK.

527
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,850
Bye, Mom. Bye, Maggie.

528
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,820
Oh, hello.

529
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,080
I don't know if I'm in the right place.
I'm looking for Neil.

530
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,450
Excuse me?

531
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,740
I'm sorry...

532
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,880
Shit!

533
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,100
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

534
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:43,070
I wanna see Neil.

535
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:48,290
Wait here.

536
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,950
I don't know her.

537
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:58,550
What are you doing?
I said the boy's father. I said tell him to come.

538
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,630
He'd never do it. He'd kill me if he knew I was
talking to you about this. He's so paranoid.

539
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,980
What's the story, man?
Close the fucking door!

540
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:10,930
- So are they. I can't let you in.
- Who are they?

541
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:14,610
Look, man, this ain't no freak show in here!
Close the damn door!

542
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,110
Look, you just gotta get outta here.

543
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,440
My husband is losing his mind.

544
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,860
I don't know why, but I think you do.

545
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:26,700
You can tell me what you know, but you can't
tell me to go away because I'm not moving.

546
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,750
- How long has he had it?
- Just a few days.

547
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:38,800
- What happened? A car wreck?
- No.

548
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:41,090
- A child die?
- No!

549
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,960
- Did he kill someone?
- He was hypnotised.

550
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,600
- Is that what started it?
- It comes and it goes.

551
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:52,320
Some people have it for five seconds.
Some, their whole lives.

552
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,110
He's a receiver now. Everything's coming in.

553
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,740
He can't stop it. He can't slow it down.
He can't even figure it out.

554
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:04,740
It's like he's in a tunnel with a flashlight,
but the light only comes on once in a while.

555
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,240
He gets a glimpse of something,
but not enough to know what it is.

556
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,410
Just enough to know it's there.

557
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,030
- Jake, too.
- Your son?

558
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:15,340
Much better flashlight.

559
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:20,500
- Does he know what it wants yet?
- What who wants?

560
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,390
He saw a ghost, didn't he?
What did it ask him to do?

561
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,100
- She didn't ask anything.
- Maybe he wasn't listening.

562
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,440
She's asked for something,
and now she's waiting...

563
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,440
..getting more and more pissed off
that he's not doing it.

564
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:39,060
If he doesn't do her thing,
she'll never go away.

565
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,950
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

566
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:22,850
- Absolutely not!
- Oh, please, please, please!

567
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:28,790
- Five more minutes. Five more minutes.
- No, zero minutes. Oh, this is cool.

568
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:32,240
- ''The Mummy'' gives you nightmares.
- No fair!

569
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:35,590
I know. I'm gonna take a bath.
Are you OK for ten minutes?

570
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,080
Whatever!

571
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:00,560
How do I know this song?

572
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:04,790
I know I know this song. I know it. I know it.

573
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,910
Freezing!

574
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,340
Round up your weapons, folks!

575
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:28,010
Charge!

576
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:38,070
I don't wanna talk right now.

577
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,280
Hey!

578
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,830
No, no...

579
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:08,660
Tom? I think the pilot blew out
on the water heater again.

580
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,420
Can you go light it for me?

581
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,960
Hello?

582
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,310
Or I could go light it.

583
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,090
Thanks, Colonel.

584
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,210
I said no!

585
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,720
Bummer!

586
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,080
Hey! That is the most amazing...

587
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:21,850
Tom?

588
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:24,830
Tom! Breathe!

589
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,070
What happened?

590
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,650
- She's there.
- What?

591
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,820
She's there.

592
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:40,250
What?

593
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:43,450
Oh, my God!

594
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:59,310
I want you to hypnotise me again.
All this shit - I want it out, I want it gone.

595
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,720
- I want it all to stop. Right now!
- Come right in. I want you to meet Clarita.

596
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,650
Hi. Sorry.

597
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,980
Sorry, I...

598
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,650
Look, do you think that you could...

599
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,150
- Could she...
- Yeah...

600
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:31,000
I know. I...

601
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,250
Well, gracias.

602
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:38,930
OK, you gotta... slow down. OK?

603
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:43,320
You gotta be a little patient with me here
cos I got a confession to make.

604
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,950
Y'see, we... we just smoked this great big
fatty a few minutes before you walked in...

605
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,490
- ..so this is blowing my mind a bit extra.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

606
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:58,500
- Yeah? - Whatever...
door you opened in my brain...

607
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,740
..l want you to shut it.

608
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,800
- Now!
- OK.

609
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,090
I'll do it. OK.
I can do that.

610
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,130
Close your eyes.

611
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:13,970
OK. Just like last time,
I want you to just focus and concentrate.

612
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:21,220
Listen to the sounds of the room,
listen to the sounds of your breathing.

613
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,110
Look at the back of your eyelids.
Do you see anything there?

614
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,730
- Could you just get to it, please?
- All right. All right.

615
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:32,900
I want you to pretend
you're back in the movie theatre.

616
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:35,120
It's very dark...

617
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:39,840
..and in the whole pitch-black theatre, the
only thing you can see is the white screen.

618
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,410
As you focus on the screen,
you begin to drift closer to it in your chair.

619
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,050
You'll notice that there are letters
on the screen - tall, thick, black letters.

620
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,420
But they're out of focus,
so you begin to drift closer to them.

621
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:56,090
- Someone's here.
- No, it's empty.

622
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:58,930
But there's someone else in here.

623
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,510
- No, you're alone in the theatre, Tom.
- No. No, I'm not.

624
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:07,310
- Your feet and your ankles are relaxed.
- No. Hard to breathe.

625
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:11,730
Your hands are limp and heavy.
Your... your arms...

626
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:15,240
- No air! No air!
- Tom, I want you to look at the screen.

627
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:16,990
Look at the screen.

628
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,910
Hey.

629
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,950
You can read the letters now.
You're right up next to them.

630
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,920
Tom! Look at the screen!

631
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:30,500
No!

632
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,590
Wow! What... what happened? Are you OK?

633
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:39,180
You need to sit down. What was happening
there was very next level.

634
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:42,300
You should have seen your face.
D'you want a beer?

635
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,940
Are you feeling better? What happened?

636
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:48,890
I'm supposed to dig.

637
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:02,240
Hi!

638
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:10,160
Hello?

639
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,720
Anybody home?

640
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,720
Wow! Look what I'm not cleaning up.

641
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,990
Interesting!

642
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,050
OK!

643
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:08,070
Hi, honey. What you doin'?

644
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:11,270
Dad said I'm supposed to dig.

645
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,190
Nice

646
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,610
Tom.

647
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,950
Tom!

648
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:31,380
- You scared me.
- I scared you?

649
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:36,300
- What are you doing?
- I'm supposed to dig.

650
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:39,090
- Whaddaya mean?
- I'm supposed to dig.

651
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,250
Who says?

652
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,150
I see. And what's Jake doing?

653
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:52,860
Jake... is helping.

654
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,240
- Why are you doing this?
- The water softens up the dirt.

655
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:02,240
No. I mean...

656
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:05,340
Could you just stop for a second?

657
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:11,170
- Tom! Can you turn around and look at me?
- What... exactly don't you understand?

658
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,410
I'm supposed to dig.

659
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:16,840
- Why are you digging?
- I'm searching.

660
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:20,010
- What are you searching for?
- The question is not what.

661
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,590
We both know very well what,
even though we don't wanna admit it.

662
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:30,430
The question, Maggie, which you can
plainly see I am very busy trying to answer...

663
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,220
The question is where.

664
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:37,110
Don't worry, he's OK.

665
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:41,480
- It's not over there.
- We're calling the police.

666
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:45,200
And tell them what, exactly?

667
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:50,000
Practise it! Run it by me once.
I wanna see how it sounds out loud.

668
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,000
Anything else?

669
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,130
Tom, why don't you come inside with me?

670
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:03,000
I wanna talk to you.
You're not yourself right now.

671
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,010
This is just fucking typical!

672
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,430
Now, what do you want me to do, Maggie?

673
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:13,090
You want me to go inside and just...
sit down on the couch in front of the TV...

674
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:19,120
..and drink beer until I fall asleep, and maybe
repeat the whole thing again tomorrow?

675
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,600
- Be quiet!
- And the day after and the day after?

676
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,530
- Just stop!
- Until...

677
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:27,660
Until I grab my chest and die?

678
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:32,160
I mean, this is the most important thing
that's ever happened to me.

679
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:36,470
I mean, this is...
this is the most... important thing...

680
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:40,680
..that I have ever done in my whole life,
in my whole stupid life!

681
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,830
And you want me to just stop?

682
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:47,050
No! No, I won't stop!

683
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:49,550
I won't stop! I won't stop!

684
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:54,430
Eight years, I've known you.

685
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:58,520
Not once have you talked to me like this.
Not once.

686
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:02,480
And if you do it again, I swear to God...

687
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:09,320
And you know what? When you talk about
how ordinary you are and your stupid life...

688
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:14,320
..you're saying ''Our stupid life,''
which I don't think is particularly stupid.

689
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:18,250
So how the fuck
am I supposed to feel about that?

690
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,470
Are you gonna drink that?

691
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:29,540
I'm sorry.

692
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:34,190
OK, I'm not sorry.

693
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:43,700
- Who's that from?
- My brother Steve.

694
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,630
- My grandma's going back in the hospital.
- No, she...

695
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,140
What?

696
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,100
What?

697
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,190
Nothing.

698
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,360
What is it?

699
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,630
Hello?

700
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:22,920
Oh, Steve. I'm sorry, we've been so busy.
I was just about...

701
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,090
What?

702
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,670
She did?

703
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,630
How am I doing, Dad?

704
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,680
You're doing great, kid. You're doing great.

705
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,810
I'm so sorry, baby.

706
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:50,770
You knew.

707
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:52,940
You knew, didn't you?

708
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:55,570
When is the funeral?

709
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:59,790
Sunday. We should leave as soon as we can.

710
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,530
You want me to go with you?

711
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:08,880
I just thought,
with your family and everything...

712
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:12,920
Do I want you to go with me...
to my grandmother's funeral?

713
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:16,140
She practically raised me!
Of course I want you to come.

714
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:20,690
It's just, I'm kinda
in the middle of something here.

715
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:32,120
$ 800 a month!
Can't get any fucking water!

716
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:34,290
Fuck!

717
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:06,400
Tools.

718
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,640
Damn!

719
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,790
Piece of shit!

720
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,190
It's a rented house!

721
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,460
- Hello?
- It's me.

722
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:02,670
- Hey, baby, how're ya doin'?
- I'm OK.

723
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,900
- How's your family?
- Drunk, fighting with each other.

724
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:11,470
Listen, Maggie, I'm so sorry. I mean,
I should be there with ya. I'm an asshole.

725
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,310
Yeah, well, you have your good points.

726
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,270
- How do you feel?
- Fine. Fine. You know...

727
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:22,230
Much... much... much better.
Everything's fine here. Really good.

728
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,530
No...

729
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:30,710
- No more digging?
- No. Back to normal.

730
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:35,710
I'm sorry, too. I wish I hadn't stormed out.
I shouldn't have left you alone.

731
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,960
I deserved it.

732
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:41,870
Why don't you come up here with us?
You could make it in an hour.

733
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:45,050
- Oh, no, I can't really do that.
- Why not?

734
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:48,230
I'm not supposed to use the truck
for personal trips.

735
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:53,980
- I'll pick you up. I'll leave right away.
- Oh, no, no, baby. Don't do that. That's crazy.

736
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,980
- I gotta go.

737
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:59,070
- I'll just pull up front and honk. Bye.
- No, no, no! No!

738
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:40,850
OK, bub, you ready to go?

739
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:44,060
I'm scared to go home.
I wanna stay at Uncle Steve's house.

740
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:48,730
- Why are you scared?
- Because of the feathers.

741
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,320
What feathers?

742
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:54,110
I don't know. I just saw feathers.

743
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,410
It's OK. I'll watch him.

744
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:00,910
OK. You be good.

745
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:03,290
Mom! Wait!

746
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,050
You forgot this.

747
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:29,060
Hi!

748
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:31,820
Hi.

749
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,440
Come here a sec.

750
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:38,750
- What?
- Come closer. I can't hear you.

751
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:44,790
- Are you talking to me?
- I wanna show you something.

752
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:46,960
You wanna show me something?

753
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:50,160
Well, yeah.
I don't see anybody else around.

754
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:54,220
- What is it?
- It's a surprise.

755
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:58,770
It's really great. Come on!
You won't believe it.

756
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:01,090
Come on! It's freezing!

757
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:09,230
Hey! Happy St Patrick's Day!

758
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,150
- What's the surprise?
- Don't you have it?

759
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:15,180
- Oh, yeah. The surprise?
- The surprise.

760
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,820
- You need another drink.
- No, I got the spins.

761
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:19,990
Drink, motherfucker, drink!

762
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:24,150
- I don't think there is a surprise.
- Oh, yeah, there is. Yeah, there is.

763
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:26,950
The surprise is we decided
we wanna be your friends.

764
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:28,790
- You do?
- Yeah.

765
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,450
- Why do you wanna be my friends now?
- Are you kidding? Look at yourself.

766
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:38,090
Look.

767
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,930
You can take your coat off, you know.

768
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,390
- You want a drink?
- I'm not supposed to.

769
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,560
Don't you do anything
you're not supposed to?

770
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,930
I do.

771
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,320
Yeah.

772
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,900
Momma, you are hot!

773
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,280
Come on, let's be friends, huh?

774
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:02,650
Well...

775
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:05,500
..you can kiss me if you want to.

776
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:08,080
Yeah... Yeah.

777
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:20,090
- Not... not like that, OK?
- OK. OK. OK...

778
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:34,470
- I wanna go home.
- Not now, no, no. Come on...

779
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:36,650
- I'll be your friend.
- I want to, but...

780
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:40,570
Just be nice to me, huh? Be a good girl.
You are a good girl, aren't you?

781
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:43,610
- I have to go home.
- How about a helmet wash?

782
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:46,490
I have to go home.
I have to go home!

783
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:58,670
No! Stop!

784
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,250
Shut up! Shut up!

785
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:05,420
Shut... God!

786
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:08,640
Shut up!

787
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:13,110
Make her stop, man!
Make her stop screaming!

788
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:14,600
Shut her up, man!

789
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:21,240
Use your jacket or something!
Put it over her face!

790
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:23,910
Shut up!

791
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:49,800
Oh, my God!

792
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:52,930
What the fuck did you do that for?

793
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:55,090
- Is she dead?
- No shit, she's dead!

794
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:57,690
Oh, my God!

795
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:01,030
- Look at her tongue, man.
- I am not here.

796
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,560
I've never seen nobody dead before.

797
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:06,280
- I can't be here.
- It's fucking gross.

798
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,910
This isn't happening.

799
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,240
Fucking plastic over her face!
Good thinking, Adam

800
01:22:14,290 --> 01:22:17,140
Well, what do we do now?

801
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,990
How's he doin'?

802
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,710
He might make it. He might not.

803
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,750
Sheila's over at the hospital.
I'm gonna head over.

804
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,170
Frank... I'm sorry.

805
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:12,840
I'm sorry because...
I think I know why Adam shot himself.

806
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,850
And... I gotta call the police about it.

807
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:20,650
And I don't want you
to hear it from them.

808
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:24,070
And I don't want Sheila
to read about it in the paper.

809
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:28,540
I think you have a right to know
before anybody else.

810
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,860
What are you talking about, Tom?

811
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:36,200
Come with me.

812
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,000
Wait here for a second.

813
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:49,230
It better be important.

814
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:03,220
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

815
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:08,530
How the hell did you find this?

816
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,570
Does it matter?

817
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:15,230
Well, you don't know
if it was Kurt and Adam.

818
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:18,120
Yeah, I do.

819
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:22,080
But you don't have anything to...

820
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:28,720
Tom, you're talking like a goddamn lunatic!
That's what people are gonna say.

821
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:31,720
It's just a body.
It doesn't prove anything.

822
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,060
She's...

823
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:37,350
She's got somebody's hair in her hand.

824
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,510
They're gonna be able
to tell whose it is.

825
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,650
Hey, Frank.

826
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:53,080
We... we gotta call the cops.

827
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:58,700
What were we supposed to do?

828
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:01,830
It was an accident.

829
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:07,460
The kids come to us,
she's already dead.

830
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:13,350
The damage is done. There's nothing
anybody can do to bring her back.

831
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:19,680
But these kids got...
everything ahead of them.

832
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:23,850
So what were we supposed to do, Tom?

833
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:28,270
Send our sons to jail for the rest of their lives
because of her?

834
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:31,770
Who are you planning
to shoot with that?

835
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:37,320
- Get the hell outta here, Tom.
- Hey, Frank... come on upstairs.

836
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:39,450
We... we could talk about this.

837
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:42,910
I've been living with this for...
six months.

838
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:49,140
Six fucking months!

839
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:56,260
Do you think anything you have to say is
gonna make one bit of difference to me?

840
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,520
- Get the hell outta here!
- I'm not leaving until...

841
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:01,760
Get out!

842
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:05,140
Get out!

843
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:19,910
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

844
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:24,990
- Well, it's really pouring, huh?
- Yeah, looks like it.

845
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:28,800
You got a minute?

846
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:31,460
No, I'm... kinda busy right now.

847
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:33,540
It's important.

848
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:42,380
I don't really
have time to talk right now, Harry.

849
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,180
Jesus! This rain, huh?

850
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:50,280
Harry, like I said, you know,
I'm really kind of busy right now.

851
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,700
Kurt, I know you weren't raised in a barn.
Close that door.

852
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:56,460
Maybe I could call you later
or something?

853
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:02,360
Tom, we got ourselves
a serious problem here.

854
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:05,570
Whaddaya mean?

855
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:08,370
What the hell you think
you're doing to my house?

856
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,050
I heard all this pounding going on.
I thought I'd check it out.

857
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:14,750
I didn't think you'd be
wrecking the place!

858
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,840
What's the matter with you?

859
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:21,590
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take care of that.

860
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:25,260
I was trying to fix your water main,
you know - it was leaking...

861
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:28,530
..and I couldn't get to it
from underneath the house.

862
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:34,730
I mean... I couldn't
get under the house to get to it.

863
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:38,440
Is that right?

864
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:42,290
Damn. A lotta water damage?

865
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,650
Some.

866
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:48,040
Can I look around?

867
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:53,500
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure.
Help yourself.

868
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:57,510
Maybe you'd better show me
where it's at.

869
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:04,170
Well, you guys'll be able to see.
I gotta take off right now.

870
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:09,570
I'm almost afraid to look.

871
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:11,390
- Drink it.
- Right.

872
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,890
Hurry up.

873
01:28:15,150 --> 01:28:18,360
The water main doesn't run
under the house.

874
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,690
Well, I know that now.

875
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:28,670
Shit, Tom.

876
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:41,670
Get him on the rug.

877
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:49,720
- Don't look at him. Roll him over.
- Yeah.

878
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:52,510
Let's go! All right...

879
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,890
..get outta the way.

880
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:37,540
Tom?

881
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:44,580
Are you here?

882
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:53,430
Shit!

883
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,270
Out of the way, Kurt!

884
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:30,840
They were gonna kill you, Tommy.
You and Maggie both.

885
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:40,480
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

886
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:55,400
Cold-blooded murder.

887
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,830
I can't let something like that happen.

888
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,250
Not here.

889
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:07,390
This was a decent neighbourhood.

890
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:05,200
Jake...

891
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,420
Jake...

892
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:14,470
Jake...
