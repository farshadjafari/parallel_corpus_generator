They are a family.

331
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,200
Not the kind of family
the government talks about.

332
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,080
They would twist it.
They would make it evil.

333

But all we're asking for,
ladies and gentlemen...

334
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,120
is to let justice be done,
though the heavens may fall.

335
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,040
Thank you.

336
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,160
Okay.
Let's see who's next.

Mr. DiNorscio.
Mr. DiNorscio.

Isn't your attorney here?

339
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,560
Well, Your Honor,
I think I'm-I'm better off-

341
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,080
Uh, I- I wanna go pro se.
I'm gonna be my own lawyer.

342
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,040
Do you know what ''pro se'' means?

343
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,480
- Sort of.
- What do you mean, ''sort of''?

344
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,200
Uh, if you defend yourself, it's called
''pro se. '' I'm gonna defend myself.

345
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,480
Mr. DiNorscio, in a case of this
magnitude, I don't think it's advisable.

My Sixth Amendment right.

347
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,120
I mean, I got the right to defend myself.
Am I correct,Judge?

348
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,520
Yes. Yeah, you're correct.
Have you had any legal experience?

349
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,840
Uh, well, sort of.

Sometimes I think
I had too much legal experience.

354
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,000
Mr. DiNorscio,
have you heard the saying...

355
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,080
that a man who represents himself
has a fool for a client?

356
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,280
Now I have. Is it true,Judge?

357
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,000
Sometimes it is.

358
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,040
So that means sometimes it ain't, right?

359
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Okay.

360
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,560
- Thank you,Judge.
- But I don't think it's advisable. It's up to you.

Uh, Mr. DiNorscio, you're on.

Hi, I'm Jackie DiNorscio.

363
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,240
Uh, I'm defending myself
in this case.

364
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,880
You'll have to excuse me,
I'm a little nervous.

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,160
You see, I'm no lawyer.

366
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,720
I only have a sixth-grade education.

367
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,880
And, uh, I'm not sophisticated in the law
like some of these other persons here.

368
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,560
But what I tell you
will come from the heart.

369
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,200
Four months ago...

370
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,640
we started to pick jurors for this trial.

371
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,000
And I wanna say right now...

372
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,320
that I'm satisfied
with everybody on the jury.

373
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,200
And I wanna thank Mr. Klandis...

374
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,160
for translating that Latin slogan
in front of the judge.

375
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,360
I thought it meant ''No smoking.''

376
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,760

came up with this RICO law thing.

Should probably ask Mr. Kierney. I guess
if you're Italian,you should be in prison.

I can tell you it's more appropriate...

than it is for me or any of my fellas here.

will tell you I've been
in jail half my life, most of my life.

to buy a rump roast from the butcher.

I told her, ''$20 for a rump roast?''

420
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,440
Of which I took her to the kitchen
where we got a full-length mirror.

421
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,720
I pull out a $20 bill out of my pocket.
I hold it up to the mirror.

422
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,760
I say, ''Sweetheart, you see
that $20 bill in the mirror?

one end of the table to the other.

where'd all the meat come from?''

many hours of surveillance...

on each one of these defendants...

- on trial here today, correct?
- I did.

657
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,760
And did the F.B.I. conclude...

that an organized crime family
existed in northern New Jersey...

- under the leadership of Nick Calabrese?
- Yes, that is correct.

that Calabrese was the boss?

It had a reputation
as being a mob hangout.

We discussed political

867

I found out that he was
a great admirer of Machiavelli.

868

So you discussed Machiavelli. No discussions
of shakedowns, payoffs or rubouts, correct?

869
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,640
That's correct. But since I once taught
a class in political philosophy...

870
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,920
I thought it ironic that Carlo Mascarpone
was an admirer of Machiavelli...

871
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
whose major theme was that
''power corrupts...

872

and absolute power
corrupts absolutely.''

873
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:54,680

applied Machiavelli's ideas...

If you walk away with only one impression

And they deserve to be punished
by society for these crimes.

1522
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:32,800
Now the defense will try to distract you
from this undeniable fact...
