You didn't come down here

It is.

Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul...

220
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,799
...but like it or not, the wife
of the governor has only one nephew...

221

...and his name is Percy Wetmore.

Little Percy calls his aunt...

223
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:05,500
...and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.

224
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,900
He mention he assaulted a prisoner
this morning out of sheer petulance?

He is mean, careless and stupid...

228

...and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

229
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,000
Sooner or later, he'll get
somebody hurt or worse.

235

Better pay.

236
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,299
Then why is he still here?

237
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,299
He can get that application
pushed through.

238
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,599
With his connections, he could have
any state job he wants.

239

You know what I think?

240
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,299
I think he just wants
to see one cook up close.

241
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:05,000
Well, he'll get his chance, then.
Won't he?

242
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:09,799
Maybe then he'll be satisfied
and move on. In the meantime...

358
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:28,299
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in.

359
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,099
That's all.

360

Anybody doesn't like it?

361

You can kiss my ass.

You try it. Go on.

363
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,099
Try it. You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

364

Okay, Brutal.

365

Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

376
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,900

-lt's all dandruffy, and it smells.

378
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,800
I will take that as a yes.

...walking the Mile.

383
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

384
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:24,800

and so forth and so on.

385
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:29,300
I'm sorry for all the bad shit
I've done and people I've tramped on.

386
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,800
And I hope they forgive me...

387

that's for sure.

...I don't believe they actually
shake their dicks.

396
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,800
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,
so Reverend Schuster's coming in.

397
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:58,400
He's good. He's fast too.
Doesn't get them all worked up.

398
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,400
On your feet, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

399

Sitting down.
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

Anything to say before

Yeah.

crazy old trustee.

I don't like it.
We'll be doing this for real.

433
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,800
I don't want anybody remembering
a stupid joke and getting going again.

01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,400
Well, that depends, Mr...?

712
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:11,400
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor
up on Cold Mountain.

713
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:13,900
The Green Mile.

714
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:17,099
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

715
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,500
I'd like to ask you about one.

716
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,500
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

717
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,900
Which client?

718
01:06:31,099 --> 01:06:33,699
BURT:
Now you got my curiosity aroused.

719
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,300
John Coffey.

720
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,500
Coffey.

721
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,099
Causing you problems?

722
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,900
Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion...

723
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,900
...but other than that...

724
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:48,300
He cries, does he?
Got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

725
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,000
You know what he did.

726
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:52,599
PAUL:
I read the court transcript.

727
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,300
Thank you, missus.

728
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,099
My pleasure.

729
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,699
Kids!

730
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,099
CYNTHIA: Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

731
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,500
KIDS:
Coming, Mama!

732
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,800
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

733
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,599
I wonder if he did anything
like that before.

734
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,900
Why? Has he said anything?

735
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:14,099
No, but a man who does
a thing like that...

736
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,000
...has often developed a taste for it
over time. It occurred to me...

737
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:22,000
...that it might be easy enough to
follow his back trail. Find out.

738
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,400
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

739
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:29,500
You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

740
01:07:29,699 --> 01:07:31,699
Believe me, we tried.

741
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:34,599
Like he'd dropped out of the sky.

742
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,699
How can that be?

743
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,900
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

744
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:45,099
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass.

745
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,300
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere.

746
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,300
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

747
01:07:52,099 --> 01:07:53,599
He is...

748
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,900
...strange, I admit.

749
01:07:56,300 --> 01:08:00,400
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

750
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,099
I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.

751
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,099
I deal with them day in and day out.

752
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,400
You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before.

753
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,500
You came to see if I think
he did it at all.

754
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,599
Do you?

755
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,600
One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.

756
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,800
He was found with the victims
in his arms.

757
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,699
And yet you defended him.

758
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:26,199
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

759
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,100
CYNTHIA:
Kids! Lunch!

760
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:29,600
Y'all listen to your mama!

761
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,600
I'll tell you something.

762
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,000
You listen close too, because it
might be something you need to know.

763
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,500
I'm listening.

764
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:43,899
We had us a dog.

765
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:46,800
Just a sweet mongrel.

766
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,500
You know the kind.

767
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,100
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

768
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,600
You get to know it.

769
01:08:55,899 --> 01:09:00,000
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use...

770
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:03,600
...but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

771
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different.

772
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,100
My wife and I were not so lucky.

773
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,500
Caleb, come here for a second.

774
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,000
Come here.

775
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:20,600
Please, son.

776
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,500
He still has the one good eye.

777
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,899
I suppose he's lucky...

778
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:30,500
...not to be completely blind.

779
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,699
We get down on our knees and thank God
for that much at least.

780
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:38,600
Right, Caleb?

781
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:42,300
Go on in, now.

782
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,399
That dog attacked my boy
for no reason.

783
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,100
Just got it in his mind one day.

784
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,199
The same with John Coffey.

785
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:57,500
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

786
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,800
But those little girls...

787
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,500
...stayed raped and murdered.

788
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,000
Maybe he'd never done it before.

789
01:10:06,699 --> 01:10:08,699
My dog never bit before.

790
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:13,000
But I didn't concern myself with that.

791
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,800
I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out.

792
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,199
Is Coffey guilty?

793
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,699
Yes, he is.

794
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:26,899
Don't you doubt it.

795
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:29,600
And don't you turn your back on him.

796
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:34,500
You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times...

797
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,800
...but in the end...

798
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,100
...you'll get bit.

896

You fellas coming?

898

No, we got other fish to fry

Just like Mr. Harry says.

902
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,300
Let's move briskly.
There's not much time.

903
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,300
All right, rehearsing now!

904
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,899

01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,800
Well, you're the VIP today, Earl,

That's that.

918

Very good. Very professional.

PAUL:
Let's do it again.

920
01:20:14,199 --> 01:20:17,000
You got all the words right.
It sounded just fine.

Thank you.

922
01:20:18,199 --> 01:20:21,500
It's hard to keep a straight face
when Toot's acting the goat.

He'd love to have a pet mouse, I bet.

How could a boy be trusted
with Mr. Jingle?

977

Maybe forget to feed him.

978

How he keep up with his training?
He just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

Tourist attraction, I said.

01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,000
Yeah, you playing with me.
Both of you.

1063
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:55,600
Just who the hell you think you are?

1064
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:00,000
We're the people you work with.

1065
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,100
But not for long.

1066
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:04,899
Percy, I want your word.

1067
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,300
My word?

1068
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,500
I put you out front for Del...

1069
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:13,500
...you put in your transfer
to Briar Ridge the next day.

1070
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:20,199
What if I just call up certain people
and tell them you're harassing me?

1071
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:22,500
-Bullying me.
PAUL: Go ahead.

1072
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:26,100
I promise you'll leave your share
of blood on the floor.

1074
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,899
No.

1075
01:31:29,699 --> 01:31:33,800
But four men will swear you stood by
while Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean.

1076

About that, people will care.
Even your uncle the governor.

01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,100
Yes, Del?

1090
01:33:37,399 --> 01:33:39,899
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1091
01:33:41,399 --> 01:33:44,000
Here. You take him.

1092
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,699

Just for now, if Del don't mind.

1097
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:13,300
You take him, John. You take him
till this foolishment be done.

1098
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,399
You gonna take him to Mouseville?

1099
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,500
We'll do it together, most likely.

1100
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,800
Maybe take a little vacation time.

1101
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:42,899
Yeah.

1102
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:45,699
People pay a dime apiece to see him.

Two cents for the kids.
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1104
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,600
That's right, Del.

1105
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,199
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1106
01:34:57,699 --> 01:34:59,100

I hate this.

1238
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:22,500
I know.

1239
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,199
JAN:
Melinda. Hi.

1240
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:44,899
I am so happy to see you.

1241
01:48:46,699 --> 01:48:48,500
Look at you.

1242
01:48:49,399 --> 01:48:51,300
We missed you at church.

1243
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,199
My hair...

1244
01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:00,199
-You look fine.
-I'm just a mess.

1245
01:49:05,399 --> 01:49:07,500
She's having one of her good days.

1246
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:09,899
I thank God for that.

1247
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:14,000
What's a bad day?

1248
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:19,000
Sometimes she's...

1249
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:21,699
...she's not herself anymore.

1250
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:23,699
She swears.

1251
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,399
She swears?

1252
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:27,100
It just pops out.

1253
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,300
Most awful language you can imagine.

1254
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,699
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

1255
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,699
I didn't know she'd ever heard
words like that.

1256
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice...

1257
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,500
I'm glad she's having a good day.

1258
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:49,800
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1259
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:06,399
Honey...

1260
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,399
...if you don't tell me
what's on your mind...

1261
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
...l'm afraid I'll have to
smother you with a pillow.

1262
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,600
I'm thinking I love you.

1263
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:28,800
I'm thinking I don't know
what I would do if you were gone.

1264
01:50:30,699 --> 01:50:32,000
Oh.

1265
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:38,100
I'm also thinking I'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1266
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,300
HARRY: Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1267
01:50:44,699 --> 01:50:45,899
JAN:
Well, thank you.

1268
01:50:46,199 --> 01:50:48,800
This is one delicious treat, ma'am,
before I go to work.

1269
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:50,500
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1270
01:50:50,899 --> 01:50:53,000
Brutal, you gonna hog all them taters?

1271
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:55,699
Yes, I am.
Harry, you want some potatoes?

1272
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:56,899
Come on, now.

1273
01:50:58,199 --> 01:51:00,800
JAN: Soon we'll just see your feet
sticking out of there, Brutus.

1274
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:03,300
You all saw what he did to the mouse.

1275
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,300
I could've gone the rest of the day
without you bringing that up.

1276
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:10,300
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1277
01:51:10,699 --> 01:51:12,399
He did the same thing to me.

1278
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,800
He put his hands on me.

1279
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,500
He took my bladder infection away.

1280
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:23,199
It's true.

1281
01:51:23,399 --> 01:51:25,699
When he came home that day, he was...

1282
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:28,399
...all better.

1283
01:51:29,899 --> 01:51:32,699
DEAN: Now, wait.
You're talking about...

1284
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,500
...an authentic healing?

1285
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,100
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1286
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:39,000
I am.

1287
01:51:39,899 --> 01:51:40,899
Oh, yeah.

1288
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:44,300
Well, if you say it, I accept it.

1289
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:47,100
What's it got to do with us?

1290
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:48,899
You're thinking about Melinda.

1291
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:50,500
Melinda?

1292
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:51,800
Melinda Moores?

1293
01:51:52,199 --> 01:51:55,800
So, Paul, you really think
you can help her?

1294
01:51:56,399 --> 01:52:00,399
It's not a bladder infection
or even a busted mouse...

1295
01:52:01,399 --> 01:52:04,100
-...but there might be a chance.
-Hold on now.

1296
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:08,800
You're talking about our jobs.
Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?

1297
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:11,199
No, Hal would never stand for that.

1298
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,899
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything, even if it fell on him.

1299
01:52:14,199 --> 01:52:15,699
So you're talking about...

1300
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:18,199
...taking John Coffey to her.

1301
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,500
That's more than just our jobs, Paul.

1302
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:27,800
That's prison time,
we get caught.

1303
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:30,899
-Dang right it is.
PAUL: No, not for you, Dean.

1304
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:34,100
The way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1305
01:52:34,399 --> 01:52:35,899
That way, you can deny everything.

1306
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:38,100
Why do I have to stay behind?

1307
01:52:40,199 --> 01:52:42,000
Our boy's grown up...

1308
01:52:42,199 --> 01:52:43,500
...gone off to school.

1309
01:52:43,699 --> 01:52:46,100
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1310
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:47,699
Brutal's a single man.

1311
01:52:47,899 --> 01:52:51,100
You're the only one here with
two children, another on the way.

1312
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:54,399
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1313
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:59,100
Brutal, help me out here.

1314
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,199
I'm sure she's a fine woman.

1315
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:03,800
The finest.

1316
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:06,100
PAUL: What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1317
01:53:06,399 --> 01:53:08,699
...to the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1318
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,699
I have no doubt.

1319
01:53:11,899 --> 01:53:13,800
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do.

1320
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:17,100
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1321
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:20,199
HARRY:
Now, what if he escapes?

1322
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:23,500
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

1323
01:53:23,699 --> 01:53:26,800
...but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1324
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,699
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1325
01:53:30,399 --> 01:53:31,699
In fact...

1326
01:53:34,199 --> 01:53:35,899
...I don't think he did it at all.

1327
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,500
I do not see God putting
a gift like that...

1328
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,699
...in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1329
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,300
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1330
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
And plus...

1331
01:53:52,399 --> 01:53:54,199
...he's huge.

1332
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:59,300
If he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1333
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:03,300
We'd all have shotguns,
in addition to side arms.

1334
01:54:03,699 --> 01:54:04,899
I'd insist on that.

1335
01:54:06,199 --> 01:54:08,800
BRUTAL: If he tried anything,
anything at all...

1336
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,300
...we'd have to take him down.

1337
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:12,800
You understand?

1338
01:54:24,199 --> 01:54:25,500
So...

1339
01:54:26,199 --> 01:54:27,899
...tell us what you had in mind.

1340
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:35,800
PAUL:
There it is.

1341
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:37,500
I see it.

1342
01:54:47,699 --> 01:54:49,600
You think this is enough?

1343
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,300
I don't know.

1344
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:29,000
You fellas thirsty?

1345
01:55:29,399 --> 01:55:30,800
Fresh out of the icebox.

1346
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,600
DEAN:
You bet. That's swell, Brutal.

1347
01:55:32,899 --> 01:55:34,500
DEAN: Thanks.
BRUTAL: Oh, yeah.

1348
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:35,699
HARRY:
Hot in here.

1349
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:36,899
Boy, howdy.

1350
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:40,199
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some too, ain't I?

1351
01:55:40,399 --> 01:55:43,699
-My ass, you get some too.
-What makes you think you deserve any?

1352
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:46,300
Because I got a big pecker.

1353
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:49,199
Well, the day report says
he's been okay.

1354
01:55:49,699 --> 01:55:52,100
BILL Y: Hell, yeah, I been behaved.
Come on, now.

1355
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:53,899
Don't be stingy hogs.

1356
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:58,399
BILL Y:
Come on.

1357
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,399
Come on now, fellers.

1358
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:03,699
Come on, boss.

1359
01:56:03,899 --> 01:56:05,699
I been good all day.

1360
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,399
It's hot in here.

1361
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:13,899
It's hot in this cell, and I'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1362
01:56:14,199 --> 01:56:16,000
Why don't you give me some?

1363
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:23,699
Come on.

1364
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:30,300
You gonna stay behaved?

1365
01:56:30,699 --> 01:56:32,000
Come on, you clunk, give me that.

1366
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:33,800
You promise me...

1367
01:56:34,199 --> 01:56:36,300
...or I'll drink this myself
right here.

1368
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:39,100
Come on, now. Don't be that way.

1369
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,100
I'll be good.

1370
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,500
(BELCHES)

1371
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:05,899
Cup.

1372
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:57,100
Anybody wants out, now's the time.

1373
01:57:57,699 --> 01:57:59,500
After this, there's no turning back.

1374
01:58:00,899 --> 01:58:02,000
So?

1375
01:58:02,899 --> 01:58:04,000
We gonna do this?

1376
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:07,399
COFFEY:
Sure. That'd be just fine.

1377
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:09,699
I'd like to take a ride.

1378
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,699
Guess we're all in.

1379
01:58:27,399 --> 01:58:28,500
What is this?

1380
01:58:30,899 --> 01:58:31,800
Payback.

1381
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:33,500
BRUTAL:
That's right.

1382
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,699
-No, you let me go! Let go of me!
PAUL: Settle down.

1383
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:41,899
PERCY: Let go!
PAUL: Settle down.

1384
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:43,300
PERCY:
What are you doing?

1385
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:44,500
PAUL:
Settle down.

1386
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:54,000
"Miss Lotta Leadpipe."

1387
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:58,199
-What would your mother say?
-You let go of me, you ignoramus.

1388
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:01,100
I know people. Big people!

1389
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:04,399
Percy, stick out your arms
like a good lad.

1390
01:59:04,699 --> 01:59:06,500
No, I won't do it.
You can't make me.

1391
01:59:06,699 --> 01:59:09,300
You're dead wrong about that, you know.

1392
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:10,600
(SCREAMS)

1393
01:59:14,699 --> 01:59:16,899
You gonna put your arms up?

1394
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:20,699
A big man is ripping your ears off.
I'd do as he says.

1395
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,399
PAUL:
There you go.

1396
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:33,500
Please, Paul.

1397
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:37,399
Please don't put me in with Wild Bill.
Please don't.

1398
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:40,500
You would think that.

1399
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:44,399
No, no, you can't do this to me.

1400
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:46,899
You can't do this to me. You can't.

1401
01:59:47,199 --> 01:59:49,399
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

1402
01:59:49,699 --> 01:59:52,699
We can and we are.

1403
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:03,500
We'll give you a few hours of quiet time
to reflect on what you did to Del.

1404
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:07,300
And if you get lonely,
just think about Miss Leadpipe.

1405
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:17,800
All right, let's go over it
one more time.

1406
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,100

you did to Del. Accept it like a man.

02:35:26,500 --> 02:35:28,500
I'm in heaven

1754
02:35:29,399 --> 02:35:34,000
And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak

1755
02:35:35,799 --> 02:35:40,500
And I seem to find
The happiness I seek

1756
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,600
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

1757
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:48,500
Why, they's angels.

1758
02:36:49,399 --> 02:36:51,899
Angels, just like up in heaven.

1759
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:52,000
I'll be all right, fellas.

1760
02:37:53,399 --> 02:37:55,500
This here's the hard part.

1761
02:37:56,799 --> 02:37:58,299
I'll be all right in a while.

1762
02:37:59,299 --> 02:38:00,500
John...

1763
02:38:00,899 --> 02:38:03,700
I should have this just for now.

1764
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:09,899
I'll give it back after.

1765
02:38:12,899 --> 02:38:17,299
You know, I fell asleep this afternoon
and had me a dream.

1766
02:38:18,399 --> 02:38:20,399
I dreamed about Del's mouse.

1767
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:22,700
Did you, John?

1768
02:38:23,500 --> 02:38:27,600
I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1769
02:38:27,799 --> 02:38:30,000
That Mouseville place.

1770
02:38:30,399 --> 02:38:32,500
I dreamed there's kids.

1771
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:36,399
And how they laughed
at his tricks. My!

1772
02:38:38,799 --> 02:38:42,399
I dreamed that those two little
blond-headed girls was there.

1773
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:44,399
They's laughing too.

1774
02:38:44,700 --> 02:38:47,399
I put my arms around them
and set them on my knees.

1775
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:51,500
And they was no blood coming out
of they hair, and they's just fine.

1776
02:38:51,799 --> 02:38:54,899
We all watched Mr. Jingles
roll that spool.

1777
02:38:56,399 --> 02:38:59,700
How we did laugh.
Fit to bust, we was!

1778
02:39:14,899 --> 02:39:16,500
PAUL:
John?

1779
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:21,100
They's lots of folks here
that hate me. Lots!

1780
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:24,899
I can feel it.

1781
02:39:25,200 --> 02:39:26,799
It's like bees stinging me.

1782
02:39:27,100 --> 02:39:29,399
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1783
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:31,700
We don't hate you.

1784
02:39:33,100 --> 02:39:34,700
BRUTAL:
Can you feel that?

1785
02:39:36,799 --> 02:39:38,799
KLAUS:
Kill him twice, you boys!

1786
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:43,399
You go on and kill that raping
babykiller twice!

1787
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:45,399
That'd be fine!

1788
02:40:01,399 --> 02:40:03,700
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1789
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:05,200
Yes, sir.

1790
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Roll on one.

1791
02:40:25,700 --> 02:40:29,100
MARJORIE:
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

1792
02:40:29,799 --> 02:40:32,000
I hope it hurts like hell.

1793
02:40:33,899 --> 02:40:36,299
John Coffey, you've been condemned
to die in the electric chair...

1794
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:37,700
...by a jury of your peers.

1795
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:41,299
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1796
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:44,799
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1797
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:48,899
I'm sorry for what I am.

1798
02:41:00,500 --> 02:41:02,100
Please, boss...

1799
02:41:03,500 --> 02:41:06,000
...don't put that thing over my face.

1800
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:09,399
Don't put me in the dark.

1801
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:12,399
I's afraid of the dark.

1802
02:41:21,700 --> 02:41:23,299
All right, John.

1803
02:41:42,700 --> 02:41:45,500
SINGS:
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1804
02:41:45,799 --> 02:41:48,399
Heaven, heaven

1805
02:41:48,700 --> 02:41:50,399
I'm in heaven

1806
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,399
Heaven, heaven

1807
02:41:53,700 --> 02:41:55,299
I'm in heaven

1808
02:42:15,399 --> 02:42:16,899
John Coffey...

1809
02:42:17,899 --> 02:42:20,899
...electricity shall pass through
your body until you are dead...

1810
02:42:21,100 --> 02:42:23,100
...in accordance with state law.

1811
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:29,000
May God have mercy on your soul.

1812
02:43:01,899 --> 02:43:03,100
Paul...

1813
02:43:06,200 --> 02:43:08,000
You have to say it.

1814
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:11,799
You have to give the order.

1815
02:43:29,100 --> 02:43:31,299
COFFEY:
He killed them with they love.

1816
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:36,100
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

1817
02:43:49,399 --> 02:43:50,700
Roll on two.

1818
02:45:31,100 --> 02:45:34,399
PAUL: It was the last execution
I ever took part in.

1819
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:38,200
I just couldn't do it anymore
after that. Brutal either.

1820
02:45:39,399 --> 02:45:43,799
We both transferred out,
took jobs with Boys' Correctional.

1821
02:45:44,100 --> 02:45:45,700
It was all right.

1822
02:45:46,399 --> 02:45:49,200
"Catch them young" became my motto.

1823
02:45:52,299 --> 02:45:53,399
You don't believe me.

1824
02:45:54,200 --> 02:45:56,700
I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul.

1825
02:45:57,399 --> 02:45:59,399
-lt's just that...
-lt's quite a story.

1826
02:45:59,700 --> 02:46:01,799
It's quite a story.

1827
02:46:02,200 --> 02:46:04,500
One thing I don't understand.

1828
02:46:04,700 --> 02:46:06,399
You said you and Jan...

1829
02:46:06,600 --> 02:46:10,000
...had a grown son in 1935.

1830
02:46:10,299 --> 02:46:11,700
Is that right?

1831
02:46:12,100 --> 02:46:14,000
The math doesn't work, does it?

1832
02:46:19,500 --> 02:46:21,899
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

1833
02:46:41,799 --> 02:46:43,100
PAUL:
Watch your step.

1834
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:45,799
Now let your eyes adjust.

1835
02:46:57,200 --> 02:46:58,200
There.

1836
02:47:01,799 --> 02:47:03,500
Wake up, old fella.

1837
02:47:03,799 --> 02:47:04,899
Wake up.

1838
02:47:08,399 --> 02:47:12,100
Paul, it isn't. It can't be.

1839
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:17,399
Come over here, boy.

1840
02:47:17,899 --> 02:47:20,100
Come on over here and see this lady.

1841
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,899
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

1842
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:33,500
(IN FRENCH)

1843
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:50,100
PAUL:
Go on, you can do it.

1844
02:47:56,899 --> 02:48:01,200
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

1845
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:05,700
But we make do. Don't we, old fella?

1846
02:48:11,899 --> 02:48:15,500
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

1847
02:48:15,799 --> 02:48:20,500
I think when we electrocuted Del,
and it all went so badly...

1848
02:48:20,799 --> 02:48:22,899
...well, John could feel that,
you know.

1849
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:26,500
And I think a part of...

1850
02:48:26,700 --> 02:48:29,299
...whatever magic was inside of him...

1851
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:32,700
...just leapt into my tiny friend here.

1852
02:48:33,799 --> 02:48:35,700
As for me...

1853
02:48:36,899 --> 02:48:39,299
...John had to give me
a part of himself...

1854
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:41,700
...a gift, the way he saw it...

1855
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:45,299
...so that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

1856
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:49,700
When John did that...

1857
02:48:51,100 --> 02:48:53,399
...when he took my hand...

1858
02:48:54,399 --> 02:48:58,000
...a part of the power
that worked through him...

1859
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:00,700
...spilled into me.

1860
02:49:01,100 --> 02:49:02,799
He...what?

1861
02:49:03,299 --> 02:49:06,700
He infected you with life?

1862
02:49:08,200 --> 02:49:10,399
It's as good a word as any.

1863
02:49:11,799 --> 02:49:14,600
He infected us both,
didn't he, Mr. Jingles?

1864
02:49:14,799 --> 02:49:16,299
With life.

1865
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:23,100
I'm 108 years old, Elaine.

1866
02:49:23,399 --> 02:49:27,500
I was 44 the year that John Coffey
walked the Green Mile.

1867
02:49:30,399 --> 02:49:33,899
You mustn't blame John.
He couldn't help what happened.

1868
02:49:34,200 --> 02:49:38,500
He was just a force of nature.

1869
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:43,000
I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

1870
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,799
Another century come to pass.

1871
02:49:49,500 --> 02:49:53,700
But I've had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years.

1872
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:56,100
Hal and Melinda...

1873
02:49:56,500 --> 02:49:57,799
...Brutus Howell...

1874
02:49:58,100 --> 02:50:00,600
...my wife, my boy.

1875
02:50:03,500 --> 02:50:05,299
And you, Elaine.

1876
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:07,899
You'll die too.

1877
02:50:09,399 --> 02:50:13,500
And my curse is knowing
that I'll be there to see it.

1878
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,299
It's my atonement, you see.

1879
02:50:17,799 --> 02:50:19,500
It's my punishment...

1880
02:50:19,700 --> 02:50:22,200
...for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning.

1881
02:50:23,799 --> 02:50:26,500
For killing a miracle of God.

1882
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,700
PRIEST:
Almighty, everlasting God...

1883
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,200
...the source of all being and life.

1884
02:50:33,399 --> 02:50:37,600
PAUL: You'll be gone like all the
others. I'll have to stay.

1885
02:50:39,500 --> 02:50:43,500
I'll die eventually.
Of that I'm sure.

1886
02:50:44,299 --> 02:50:48,100
I have no illusions of immortality.

1887
02:50:48,500 --> 02:50:50,799
But I will have wished for death...

1888
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:53,600
...long before death finds me.

1889
02:50:54,700 --> 02:50:58,299
In truth, I wish for it already.

1890
02:50:59,500 --> 02:51:01,899
(MAN SINGS OVER RADIO)

1891
02:51:09,899 --> 02:51:11,799
Mr. Jingles?

1892
02:51:20,500 --> 02:51:22,500
Where you been?

1893
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:26,100
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry?

1894
02:51:26,899 --> 02:51:29,200
Let's see if we can find you
something to eat.

1895
02:51:30,299 --> 02:51:33,899
A few crumbs anyway.
I know you'd like that.

1896
02:51:35,299 --> 02:51:36,600
Look at you.

1897
02:51:38,200 --> 02:51:41,899
PAUL: I lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.

1898
02:51:42,100 --> 02:51:44,100
And I wait.

1899
02:51:44,899 --> 02:51:47,500
I think about all the people
I've loved...

1900
02:51:47,799 --> 02:51:49,799
...now long gone.

1901
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:52,799
I think about my beautiful Jan...

1902
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:55,899
...how I lost her so many years ago.

1903
02:51:57,299 --> 02:52:01,700
And I think about all of us walking
our own Green Mile...

1904
02:52:01,899 --> 02:52:04,500
...each in our own time.

1905
02:52:05,500 --> 02:52:08,500
But one thought
more than any other...

1906
02:52:08,799 --> 02:52:11,399
...keeps me awake most nights:

1907
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:16,299
If he could make a mouse
live so long...

1908
02:52:16,700 --> 02:52:19,600
...how much longer do I have?

1909
02:52:22,799 --> 02:52:25,399
We each owe a death.

1910
02:52:25,700 --> 02:52:28,100
There are no exceptions.

1911
02:52:28,799 --> 02:52:30,700
But, oh, God...

1912
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:33,299
...sometimes...

1913
02:52:33,899 --> 02:52:37,399
...the Green Mile seems so long.

1914
03:00:16,899 --> 03:00:17,899
