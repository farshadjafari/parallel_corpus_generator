1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,036
(drumroll)

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:10,098
(rousing orchestral fanfare playing)

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:13,840
(fanfare ends)

4
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,765
(horn honking)

5
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:38,398
(engine revving)

6
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,132
(horns honking)

7
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,304
(horn honking)

8
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,745
(second horn honking)

9
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,613
(tires squealing)

10
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,514
(bicycle bell tinkles)

11
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,454
(horns honking)

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,993
(horn honks)

13
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,926
(second horn honks)

14
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,463
(tires screech)

15
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,624
(engine revving)

16
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,433
(tires screeching)

17
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,941
(shouting in Hindi)

18
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,574
(indistinct chatter in Hindi,
woman speaking over P.A.)

19
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,654
That's my train.

20
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,310
Wait! Wait!

21
00:01:54,481 --> 00:02:00,147
(The Kinks'
"This Time Tomorrow" playing)

22
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:06,616
#This time tomorrow #

23
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:10,492
#Where will we be? #

24
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:14,158
# On a spaceship somewhere #

25
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:21,139
# Sailing across an empty sea #

26
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,938
#This time tomorrow #

27
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,512
#What will we know? #

28
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,948
#Will we still be here #

29
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:37,648
#Watching an in-flight
movie show? #

30
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:41,523
# I'll leave the sun behind me #

31
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:48,158
#And I'll watch the clouds
as they sadly pass me by #

32
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,032
# Seven miles below me #

33
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:57,565
# I can see the world
and it ain't so big at all #

34
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,577
# Oh... #

35
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,907
(train bells dinging)

36
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,710
#This time tomorrow #

37
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:07,252
#What will we see? #

38
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,186
# Fields full of houses #

39
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:17,128
# Endless rows
of crowded streets. #

40
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,383
(sighs)

41
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,451
(quietly): Shit.

42
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,144
Ow.

43
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,915
(inhales deeply)

44
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:52,829
(snores quietly)

45
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:56,868
Wake up, Jack.

46
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,671
(chuckles)

47
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,922
Have you seen Francis?

48
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,048
(glasses clinking)

49
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,057
Hello, Peter.

50
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,804
- (Peter chuckles)
- (knocking at door)

51
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,002
Good afternoon. Whitman?

52
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,545
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,638
May I see your tickets, please?

54
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,955
Thanks.

55
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,787
There's no smoking, please.

56
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,566
(train car chugging)

57
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,707
Welcome aboard.

58
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,776
(speaking in Hindi)

59
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,911
Sweet lime?

60
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,503
- Yes, please.
- Sure, I'll have one.
- Sounds good.

61
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,780
(inhales softly)

62
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,758
Let's go get a drink
and smoke a cigarette.

63
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:40,172
I want to start by thanking you both
for being here. Thank you.

64
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,467
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

65
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,872
You're the two most important
people in the world to me.

66
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,468
I've never said that before, but it's true,
and I want you both to know it.

67
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,848
I love you, Peter.

68
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,144
Thank you.

69
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,445
I love you, Jack.

70
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,215
I love you, too.

71
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,789
How did it get to this?

72
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,915
Why haven't we spoken in a year?

73
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,288
Let's make an agreement.

74
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,418
- To do what?
- Okay.

75
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,189
A: I want us
to become brothers again

76
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,595
like we used to be,
and for us to find ourselves

77
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,688
and bond with each other.

78
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,858
Can we agree to that?

79
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,299
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- B: I want us

80
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,836
to make this trip
a spiritual journey,

81
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,429
where each of us seek the
unknown, and we learn about it.

82
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,598
Can we agree to that?

83
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,266
- Sure.
- I guess so.

84
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,470
C: I want us
to be completely open

85
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,240
and say yes to everything,

86
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,871
even if it's shocking and painful.

87
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,279
Can we agree to that?

88
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,783
Now, I had

89
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,911
Brendan make us an itinerary.

90
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,079
Who's Brendan?

91
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,417
My new assistant.

92
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,822
He's gonna place an updated
schedule under our doors

93
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,723
every morning of all
the spiritual places

94
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,557
and temples
that we need to see

95
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,857
and expedite hotels

96
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,023
and transportation and everything.

97
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,361
How's he gonna do that?

98
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,958
I had him bring a printer
and a laminating machine.

99
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,162
Where is he?

100
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,034
In a way, it actually
doesn't matter.

101
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,904
He's in a different compartment
on another part of the train,

102
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,806
but we never see him- ever.

103
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,139
That's more or less it.

104
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,372
Three, please.

105
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,947
Does that sound okay to you?

106
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,276
It sounds good, sure.

107
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,611
Yeah, it sounds good.

108
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,946
Do you have any questions?

109
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,282
- I do.
- Okay, go ahead.

110
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,481
What happened to your face?

111
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,488
I only remember
certain details,

112
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,958
but from what I've been able
to reconstruct,

113
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,859
it was raining, I was going
about 50 miles an hour

114
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,455
as I went into a corner,
did some wrong steering,

115
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,434
wheels went out from me,
and I suddenly, whoo,

116
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,528
skidded off the road,
slammed into a ditch

117
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,834
and got catapulted
50 feet through the air.

118
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,932
Little particles
of glass and debris

119
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,977
were stinging my face as I flew.

120
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,342
And for a second,
there was just total silence.

121
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,506
Just...

122
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,048
(imitates wind)

123
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,209
Then bam! The bike crashed
to the ground,

124
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,980
exploded and caught on fire,

125
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,954
and I smashed into the side
of a hill with my face.

126
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,456
I was driving home.

127
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,493
I live alone right now.

128
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,791
Anyway, two joggers ran up
and started digging out

129
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,660
all the dirt that was
jammed inside my mouth

130
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,929
and my nose and my ears.

131
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,061
My brain had stopped,
my heart had stopped,

132
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,366
so technically I was dead
at this point.

133
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,567
They did all the procedures
exactly right,

134
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,577
as a result of which
I'm still alive.

135
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,169
- Boy.
- Wow.

136
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,878
The first thing I thought
of when I woke up was,

137
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,578
I wish Peter and Jack were here.

138
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,440
Have you heard anything from Mom?

139
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,600
No.

140
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,109
Have you?

141
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,200
No.

142
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,940
Me neither.

143
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,516
Fuck.
(mutters)

144
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,718
What's that?

145
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,346
Some kind of Indian muscle relaxer.

146
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,721
I got it at the pharmacy
next to the train station.

147
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,521
What's that?

148
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,186
You don't need a prescription here.

149
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,422
A type of Indian flu medicine.

150
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,793
It's got a tranquilizer in it.

151
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,059
PETER: What's that?

152
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,191
Strongest Indian
painkiller you can get.

153
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,269
It's for my face.

154
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,598
Be careful with that.

155
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,865
You only want to take one drop.

156
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,272
(woman speaking German)

157
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,437
- (speaking German)
- Shh.

158
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,414
I also lost a tooth.

159
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,778
You want to read a short
story I wrote in France?

160
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,354
(muffled): How long is it?

161
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,387
What?

162
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,515
- How long is it?
- How long is it?

163
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,956
Never mind. Forget it.

164
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,688
You can save it till after dinner.

165
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,697
You know,
maybe right before

166
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,269
whenever you're about
to take out your tooth,

167
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,894
you should say something
like, "Please forgive this."

168
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,438
Because it's, actually,
it's kind of...

169
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,837
Can... you... back away a little?

170
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,273
You just spit in my eye.

171
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,641
When was the last time you
were in America, by the way?

172
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,513
I don't know.

173
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,608
The funeral.

174
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,278
In other words, a year?

175
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,151
I have to tell you,

176
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,692
I support this relationship
not working out.

177
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,357
May I take your order, please?

178
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,362
Let's see.

179
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,659
Do we want meat or fish?

180
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,994
I'm gonna have the chicken.

181
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,262
Jack, you want to try the fish?
I bet that's delicious.

182
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,302
And, Peter, the lamb?

183
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,735
A chicken, a fish and a lamb?

184
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,806
How does that sound?

185
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,804
Who wants a soup?
Raise your hand.

186
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,543
Are those Dad's glasses?

187
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:14,977
Yeah.

188
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,248
You still have
his prescription in here.

189
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,287
How can you see in these?

190
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,355
Three soups.

191
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,481
WAITER: Soup.

192
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,989
Could you not order for me, please?

193
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,119
What?

194
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,958
Order for yourself.

195
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,531
(women arguing in German)

196
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,771
(laughing)

197
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,807
What part are you on?

198
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,068
Nothing.

199
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,508
It reminded me of something
not related to it.

200
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,170
How's Alice?

201
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,976
She's fine.

202
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,812
She actually started
this company

203
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,886
where she makes these
little clay pots.

204
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,215
They're quite popular.

205
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,516
We sent you one.

206
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,421
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

207
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,925
Oh, thank you.

208
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,825
I want that stewardess.

209
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,699
(women arguing loudly in German)

210
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,399
(mutters)
These Germans are bothering me.

211
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,874
(speaking German)

212
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:21,743
Ladies! Please keep it down.
Lower your voices. Thank you.

213
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,045
Did I... raise us?

214
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,123
Kind of?

215
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,157
Hang on- I'm gonna ask this guy

216
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,819
if he can get me a power adapter.

217
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,101
She's pregnant.

218
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,103
Alice.

219
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,433
Really?

220
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,405
- You're kidding.
- No.

221
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,408
Uh, how long?

222
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,535
Seven and a half months.

223
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,206
So it's gonna be
born in, like,

224
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,215
six weeks or something.

225
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,217
I think so, yeah.

226
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,310
I'm trying not
to get too caught up

227
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,479
in it right now.

228
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,079
Don't tell Francis.

229
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,092
Brendan got the wrong voltage.

230
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,355
Your soup, sir.

231
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,331
Please forgive this.

232
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,957
(tooth clinking)

233
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,808
Hmm.

234
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,911
Is it supposed to be sad?

235
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,913
I think so.

236
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,415
Well, I'm not too crazy
about the part

237
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,418
where I start screaming
at the mechanic.

238
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,578
That never happened.

239
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,588
The characters are all fictional.

240
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,590
May I take your dessert order, sir?

241
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,057
Let's see.

242
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,525
Do we want sweets or fruit?

243
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,686
I'm gonna have the pudding.

244
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,229
Jack, you want to try the cake?

245
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,798
And, Peter, what looks good to you?

246
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,799
The cookies?

247
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,801
He's gonna order for himself.

248
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,871
The cookies.

249
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,231
Excuse me, I'm...

250
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,310
(clears throat)

251
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,715
Has he been rooting around
and taking things?

252
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,217
Maybe.

253
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,752
I think he's still in mourning.

254
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,685
Well, I probably
am, too, but there's

255
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,520
something kind of unethical
about it, isn't there?

256
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,854
Legally those glasses

257
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,894
belong to all three of us.

258
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,247
(medicine dripping)

259
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,415
I'm gonna take this bed,

260
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,885
because I'm the oldest
and my ankle's fractured.

261
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,354
Peter, you don't mind climbing
a ladder as I recall,

262
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,357
so why don't you set up shop
topside?

263
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,689
And, Jack, you're a little bit
of a lone wolf.

264
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,025
Why don't you bunk out next door?

265
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,099
How does that sound?

266
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,833
Oh, sorry.

267
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,999
- L-I was...
- FRANCIS: Stand up.

268
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,507
Brendan, this is Jack.

269
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,168
- Good evening.
- And this is Peter.

270
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,506
Hello, Brendan.

271
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,637
Nice to meet you.

272
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,805
Let's update me.

273
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,782
How's everything going back there?

274
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,443
- Pretty good.
- What does that mean?

275
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,815
I never heard back.

276
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,548
So try again.
What are you waiting for?

277
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,590
Well, I left a message.

278
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,626
Why are you smiling?

279
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,092
What do you think
he looks like

280
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,594
under all that tape and everything?

281
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,255
FRANCIS (muffled):
Brendan, what did I tell you?!

282
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,696
Well, I don't know
about his face,

283
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,734
but I think his brain
might be pretty traumatized.

284
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:30,767
Damn it!

285
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,929
Come down to this spot over here.

286
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,266
Call her again
right now

287
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,601
and keep calling
every ten minutes

288
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,107
- until you get through.
- Okay.

289
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,437
This is urgent.
We're almost there.

290
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,102
- Okay.
- And once again,

291
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,611
so we're explicitly clear,

292
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,045
I don't want you
to mention this

293
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,706
or discuss it with anyone.

294
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,216
In other words, it's a surprise.

295
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,649
Okay.

296
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,550
Did you find me a power adapter?

297
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,555
Not yet.

298
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,557
JACK:
How long are you gonna stay here?

299
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,559
What do you mean?

300
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,219
He said till the end of the month.

301
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,229
Uh-huh.

302
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,196
Why do you ask that?

303
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,768
I'm just trying to know so
I can figure out my plans.

304
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,769
What plans?

305
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,270
I don't know yet.

306
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,432
Anyways, I've got my own
ticket, just in case.

307
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,771
Don't tell Francis.

308
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,209
Well, I'm not gonna stay here
with just me and him.

309
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,541
(door opens)

310
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,548
Is that one of Alice's pots?

311
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,708
FRANCIS: Oh.

312
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,717
We should order some more of these.

313
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:21,945
I'll tell Brendan.

314
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,351
Okay.

315
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,616
He has this disease where
his head is shaved,

316
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,055
except he doesn't
have to shave it

317
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,389
because he can't grow any
hair in the first place.

318
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,293
Don't... talk about it
around him, though.

319
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,660
It might offend him.

320
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,028
(window opens)

321
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,728
Are these Dad's keys?

322
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,170
Yeah.

323
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,674
You've got his car keys, too?

324
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,506
Where's those nuts at?

325
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,838
(buzzing)

326
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,112
(knocking on door)

327
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,315
I got it, I got it, I got
it, I got it, I got it.

328
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,187
Good evening, Mr. Whitman.
How can I help you?

329
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,056
Is it possible for us
to get some more

330
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,628
of those Savoury Snacks, please?

331
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,628
Of course.

332
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,096
Can I offer you anything else?

333
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,427
Um... I don't think so.

334
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,932
I'll be right back.

335
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,401
I forgot something.

336
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,428
(knocking on window)

337
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,982
You want to smoke a cigarette
with me in the bathroom?

338
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,025
You're crazy.

339
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,195
What's your name?

340
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,364
Jack. What's yours?

341
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,964
Rita.

342
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,634
You're beautiful.

343
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,774
Don't come into me.

344
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,727
Jack's got his own return ticket.

345
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,227
He says he might leave early.

346
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,626
What are you talking about?

347
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,163
Don't tell him I told you.

348
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,823
Brendan's got all the tickets.

349
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,265
There's a whole itinerary.

350
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,835
Where is he going?

351
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,800
Air Italiano?

352
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,606
What the fuck is this?

353
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,203
I'm keeping his passport.

354
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,249
In fact, give me yours, too.

355
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,977
I want to keep
all the passports

356
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,712
so nothing happens to them.

357
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,014
I'm keeping mine.

358
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,590
No. I want to keep
them all together.

359
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,691
Why are you standing there?

360
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,391
I'm waiting for you.

361
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,900
Mr. Whitman,
the whole point

362
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,264
of us coming
out separately

363
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,803
is so no one sees us together.

364
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,929
Jack.

365
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,199
Jack.

366
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,207
Right. I get it. Okay.
Good night, then.

367
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,503
Go back to your compartment.

368
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,582
Move over, please.

369
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:21,221
Where are the Savoury Snacks?

370
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,793
Huh?

371
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,496
Did you just fuck that Indian girl?

372
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,192
What?

373
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,167
Sweet Lime.

374
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,260
Of course not.

375
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,964
I went for a walk.

376
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,973
Something just happened.

377
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,853
- Shh!
- Who's he talking to?

378
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,259
No one.
He's got the code

379
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,263
to his ex-girlfriend's
answering machine,

380
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,094
and he's checking her messages.

381
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,965
What? When... When did
he confide that to you?

382
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,267
Just now.

383
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,102
Why am I not a part of this?

384
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,644
I've never liked that girl.

385
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,578
Me neither.

386
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,947
Anyway, I never trusted her.

387
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,641
I don't feel good about myself.

388
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,145
FRANCIS:
Okay. Let's make another agreement.

389
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,080
On the spiritual journey,
it's crucial

390
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,980
that we don't splinter
into factions

391
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,143
or not include somebody

392
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,686
who has advice and may know better.

393
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,755
- Can we agree to that?
- Okay.

394
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,619
- What did you find out?
- Nothing.

395
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,625
Good.

396
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,592
She put this in my suitcase.

397
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,058
(all sniffing)

398
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,724
Is that her?

399
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,564
Mm. That's her.

400
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,070
How did she gain access
to your personal belongings?

401
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,663
She came to see me in
France for 24 hours.

402
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,174
Could she be gaslighting you?

403
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,505
What's gaslighting?

404
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,078
Okay, hang on a second.

405
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,703
Let's make another agreement.

406
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,907
From now on,
if you want to talk to her

407
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,043
or check her messages,
you speak to us first.

408
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,781
Day or night. Anytime.
Can you agree to that?

409
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,416
I think we should destroy that.

410
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,965
Jesus!

411
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,591
Okay. All right.

412
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,602
Let's check the itinerary.

413
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,998
Give me a little light.

414
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,042
Okay, here we go.

415
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,543
Train stops first thing
tomorrow morning

416
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,203
for an hour and 45 minutes,

417
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,077
which is just enough time
for a quick visit

418
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,581
to Temple of a Thousand Bulls,

419
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,050
probably one of
the most spiritual places

420
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,383
in the entire world.

421
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,022
Wow.

422
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,059
Power adapters!

423
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,287
Can I get a power adapter?

424
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,295
Yes, yes, yes.

425
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,831
Do you have a power adapter?

426
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,400
No, no.
No power adapter.

427
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,366
Use battery.

428
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,633
Do you have these in, say,
a ten-and-a-half medium?

429
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,640
These all size.

430
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,471
Take off shoes and try.

431
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,805
PETER: Yeah, like that. That's good.

432
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,811
Pepper spray. What ingredients
does this have in it?

433
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,437
I don't want to kill
anybody or anything.

434
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,913
No, no.
Not for killing.

435
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,210
Spray in face.

436
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,979
Okay. Spray in face.

437
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,417
Spray in face.

438
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,751
(hissing)

439
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,688
Most rare, from desert.

440
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,350
Very poisonous.

441
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,520
How much you want for him?

442
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,598
(bells ringing, people chanting)

443
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,669
This is incredible.

444
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,004
(bell dings)

445
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,845
(bell dings)

446
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,275
Ring it.

447
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,350
(ringing)

448
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,721
(ringing)

449
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,916
Take some of these
rupees and put them

450
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,995
on this thing in front
of the deity here.

451
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,664
(inhaling, exhaling deeply)

452
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,067
Is that my belt?

453
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:03,902
Can I borrow it?

454
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,067
Well, no, not right now.

455
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,145
I was looking for that earlier.

456
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,078
(grunts)

457
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,246
- Ask first... next time.
- Right.

458
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,755
Where's my passport?

459
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,086
I got pickpocketed.

460
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,421
My passport got stolen.

461
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,926
Calm down.

462
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,360
- It's not stolen.
- No, yes, it is.

463
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,329
- It's gone.
- No, it's not.

464
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,660
I have it.

465
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,927
I'll be right back.

466
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,769
You stole my passport?

467
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,499
Peter, where are you going?

468
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,340
I'm going to go pray
at a different thing.

469
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,946
I hear you're leaving early.

470
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,178
What are you talking about?

471
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,117
I thought we made an agreement.

472
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,519
That's why you stole my passport?

473
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,386
Well, no, but I think
we have a chance

474
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,426
to make this kind of a
life-changing experience,

475
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,461
and I think we need it.

476
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,531
In other words,
I don't want you to leave.

477
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,066
He's going to have a
kid in six weeks.

478
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,897
- Who?
- Him, Rubby.

479
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,868
- He doesn't want you to know.
- "Rubby"?

480
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,963
Yeah, you know, Rubby.

481
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,241
- Yeah.
- (chuckles)

482
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,403
Why doesn't he want me to know?

483
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,982
JACK:
Because we don't trust each other.

484
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,052
Wow, right?

485
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,588
- Yeah, amazing.
- Great, thanks.

486
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,317
Let's get a shoeshine.

487
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,658
Oh, hit it.

488
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,529
Hey. Hey, come back here!

489
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,369
- What?
- The kid just left...

490
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,772
- Who?
- He just...

491
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,808
(shouting): Get him!

492
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,435
- He left his shoeshine kit.
- He...

493
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,104
Well, now he can pay
for this building.

494
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,011
Those are $3,000 loafers!

495
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,640
Yeah, but he only got one of them.

496
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,218
Yeah, but that's...

497
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,121
We're in an emergency here.

498
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,691
I got my face smashed in,

499
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,384
Jack's heart's been
ripped to shreds,

500
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,155
and Rubby's having a child.

501
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:05,963
Let's get into it.

502
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,224
You told him?

503
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,663
It's okay.

504
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,257
Okay, that's what
we're here for,

505
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,858
to start trusting each other.

506
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,494
I don't get it, by the way.

507
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,903
Why aren't we celebrating?

508
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,702
'Cause I don't want
to talk about it.

509
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,902
Well, why not?

510
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,569
(sighs)

511
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,409
I guess because
I always expected

512
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,915
eventually I'll get divorced,
so having children...

513
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,575
really wasn't part of my plan.

514
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,711
Okay, but you're never
gonna do better than Alice,

515
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,220
and what's the point
in getting married...

516
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,587
Why'd you expect to get divorced?

517
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,660
I don't know.
I love Alice.

518
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,656
Maybe it relates
to how we were raised.

519
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,427
I was gonna save this
for later in the itinerary,

520
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,768
but I think it's time.

521
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,068
There's a ceremony I want
us to do where we each

522
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,440
take one of these peacock feathers.

523
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,978
We're gonna go off
into the wilderness

524
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,104
and meditate for...

525
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,772
Damn it, I gave them to Brendan.

526
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,282
That's all right, we'll
do it after the next stop.

527
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,716
Those guys are laughing at us.

528
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,720
Where?

529
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,557
I love it here.

530
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,286
These people are beautiful.

531
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,964
They're playing cricket
with a tennis ball.

532
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,166
(boys laughing)

533
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,236
- (bicycle bell dings)
- Hello.

534
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,571
- How do you do?
- Hello.

535
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,904
It's great.

536
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,744
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

537
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,010
It's so well-written.

538
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,881
You remember everything so clearly.

539
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,250
Peter getting all frantic
getting the car started,

540
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,346
you with the suitcase.

541
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,049
The characters are all fictional.

542
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,286
Well, anyway,
I think it's the best thing

543
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,919
you've ever written.

544
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,395
Thank you.

545
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,443
Here are the peacock feathers,

546
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,108
plus some instructions
from the guru.

547
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,310
What's in that box?

548
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,409
He bought a snake.

549
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,647
It's got a skull and crossbones...

550
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,154
Let's update me.

551
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:15,925
Anything?

552
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,790
She got the message, yeah.

553
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:18,954
And?

554
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:19,996
What? That's it.

555
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,690
That's it.
She got the message.

556
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,165
You're satisfied with that?

557
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,133
Well, she knows you're coming.

558
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,033
Does she want to see us?

559
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,504
But she's your mother.

560
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,079
Happy birthday...
from last year.

561
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,287
I can't accept this.
It's too valuable.

562
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,485
It's got one
wrong initial,

563
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:50,891
but you can paint over it.

564
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,053
It's from me and Jack.

565
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,073
(knocking)

566
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,083
Yes?

567
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,346
RITA: Would you like tea?

568
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,478
Okay.

569
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,226
Thank you.

570
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,840
(folk rock)

571
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:59,586
#You talk like Marlene Dietrich #

572
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:03,292
#And you dance
like ZiziJeanmaire #

573
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,268
#Your clothes are
all made by Balmain #

574
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,895
I got to get off this train.

575
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:11,032
#And there's diamonds
and pearls in your hair #

576
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,702
#Yes, there are #

577
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,543
#You live in a fancy apartment #

578
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:22,916
# Off the Boulevard Saint-Michel... #

579
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,784
What's her name again?

580
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:25,913
Rita.

581
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,118
(Peter mumbles)

582
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,718
What'd you say?

583
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,763
There's a hole in it.

584
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,802
He escaped.

585
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,769
No, he didn't.

586
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,568
How?

587
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,703
(all yelling, gasping)

588
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,979
PETER:
Now-Now you believe me, assholes?

589
00:30:56,187 --> 00:31:00,317
We think a snake might
have gotten on board.

590
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:07,921
# But where do you go to,
my lovely #

591
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,296
#When you're alone
in your bed? #

592
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,667
Don't go in there, Rita.

593
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,601
(snake hissing, Rita gasps)

594
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,609
FRANCIS: You got him!

595
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,646
(woman speaks German)

596
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,820
(speaks Hindi)

597
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,727
I'm kicking you off
at the next station.

598
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,160
Please don't do that.

599
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,788
We're very sorry.
It won't happen again.

600
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,628
I know it won't.

601
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,065
What's that smell?

602
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,658
Voltaire Number Six.

603
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,538
Do you have
a prescription for these?

604
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,738
A prescription?
I almost died.

605
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,006
Give me a second.

606
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,280
#Where do you go to,
my lovely #

607
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:05,515
#When you're alone
in your bed? #

608
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:10,453
#Tell me the thoughts
that surround you #

609
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,290
That animal's deadly poisonous

610
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,024
and you brought him onto my train.

611
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,599
We didn't know.
It was an accident.

612
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,066
We're just trying
to experience something.

613
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,833
It's very important to us.

614
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,136
(indistinct radio transmission)

615
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,505
(speaks Hindi)

616
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,284
You're confined
to your compartment

617
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:36,580
until further notice.

618
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,521
Is our snake getting confiscated?

619
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,728
(music playing)

620
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,487
Do you think it's working?

621
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,218
Do we feel something?

622
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,056
- I hope so.
- It's got to.

623
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,656
Do you trust me?

624
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,316
(loud thumping)

625
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,724
Where are we?

626
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:32,734
(door squeaks)

627
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,828
(speaking Hindi)

628
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,668
(speaking Hindi)

629
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,473
(clanking)

630
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,748
(indistinct chatter in Hindi)

631
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,854
Brendan, what's going on?

632
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,726
I don't know. I guess
the train's lost.

633
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:01,992
What'd he say?

634
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,158
He says the train's lost.

635
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,167
How can a train be
lost? It's on rails.

636
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,430
Apparently we took a wrong
turn at some point last night.

637
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:08,436
That's crazy.

638
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,665
How far off course are we?

639
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,674
Nobody knows-we haven't
located us yet.

640
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,936
What'd you just say?

641
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:13,976
What?

642
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:15,636
What you just said.
Say it again.

643
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:16,713
We haven't located us yet.

644
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,076
Aah!

645
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,809
Is that symbolic?

646
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:24,115
"We... haven't
located... us... yet."

647
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,553
Where's those feathers at?

648
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,181
In the envelope
I gave you this morning.

649
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,419
Meet me on top of
that thing out there.

650
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,772
The guru told me
when the moon turns...

651
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,616
Do you trust me?

652
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,254
I hired a private detective
to track down Mom.

653
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:08,332
She's living in a convent in
the foothills of the Himalayas.

654
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,024
We'll be there in six days.

655
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,747
How is that possible?

656
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,749
I guess she became a nun,
apparently.

657
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,840
You know what she's like.

658
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:28,884
A nun?

659
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:29,884
Apparently.

660
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,887
Did you talk to her?

661
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,013
No, I didn't.

662
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,352
Does she know we're coming?

663
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,925
I think so.

664
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,723
How do you know she wants to see us?

665
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,821
She probably doesn't.

666
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,332
But maybe she does.

667
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,565
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

668
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,106
Because I'm trying
to protect you

669
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,234
from all the painful emotions
this is probably gonna stir up.

670
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,642
Well, aren't you kind of
doing that right now?

671
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,373
Yeah.

672
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,813
I'm scared, too.

673
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:03,148
She's obviously suffered
some kind of mental collapse

674
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,347
and we've got to go get her
and bring her back home.

675
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,257
Actually, it's in the itinerary,

676
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,294
but I put it under "T.B.D."

677
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,727
(laughs)

678
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:14,991
Why are you laughing?

679
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,224
You didn't tell us
'cause we never

680
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,963
would've come here
if we knew about it.

681
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,576
I'm gonna hold this in
for a little while.

682
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:31,978
(train whistle blowing)

683
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,568
You gonna drink that whole
bottle of cough medicine?

684
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,299
That's a dumb way to get loaded.

685
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,577
Let's look at the itinerary.

686
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,706
Fuck the itinerary.

687
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,283
(sighs)

688
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,548
You know, I think I'm gonna have
to get that belt back after all.

689
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:14,386
Because it cost me $6,000
and it was made special for me.

690
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,483
We'll get you a different present.

691
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,028
I don't think so.

692
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,189
What is that supposed to mean?

693
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,097
It means there's been too much
Indian giving over the years.

694
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:29,230
(knocking on door)

695
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,373
These guys are driving me crazy.

696
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,341
Is there an empty compartment
I can move into?

697
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,540
No, there isn't.
We're fully booked.

698
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,345
I really want to kiss you
right now. Can I?

699
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,551
No.

700
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,249
No?

701
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,021
But we already... did it.

702
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,095
I have a boyfriend.

703
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,857
You do?

704
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,797
Actually, I just broke up with him.

705
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,425
Or I'm about to.

706
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,697
(bell buzzes)

707
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,069
I really need someone
to talk to right now.

708
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,405
And I feel like you might be
very important to me in my life.

709
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,305
All right.

710
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,053
(bell buzzes)

711
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,787
(knocking on door)

712
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:27,955
What did I tell you?

713
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,396
Get back in your room.

714
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,937
- What's happening?
- What do you mean?

715
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,904
- I rang the bell.
- I'll be right there.

716
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,532
(chattering, music playing)

717
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,479
(dinging)

718
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,982
(music playing)

719
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,642
(razor buzzing)

720
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:53,146
Is that Dad's razor?

721
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,246
Yeah.

722
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:55,848
Can I say something?

723
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,291
What?

724
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,522
You don't have permission
to take his property

725
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,860
that belongs to all of us
and use it for yourself

726
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,024
as if it's yours.

727
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,897
Jack agrees with that.
Right, Jack?

728
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,232
Plus, Dad would've hated it.

729
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,327
Why?

730
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,667
That's my opinion.

731
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,105
I knew him well.

732
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,376
That's a terrible thing to say.

733
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:15,809
Well, I don't mean it to be.

734
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,676
I just don't want you
to get the feeling

735
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,545
that you're better friends
with him than we are

736
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,117
or something weird like that.

737
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,152
And, also, you can't
leave your wife

738
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,312
just because she's pregnant.

739
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,390
Jack agrees with that, too.
Right, Jack?

740
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,424
Stop including me.

741
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,323
I was his favorite.

742
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,988
He told me that with blood all
over him laying in the street

743
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,394
right before he died.

744
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,963
How is that supposed
to make us feel?

745
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,038
I want my passport back.

746
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,234
Francis?

747
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:47,605
Yeah?

748
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,008
Here's your belt.

749
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,883
(growls)

750
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,613
(grunting)

751
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,891
Fuck. Stop!

752
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,235
- You don't love me!
- Yes, I do!

753
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,239
I love you, too, but I'm gonna
mace you in the face!

754
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,740
Stop!

755
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,669
(screaming)

756
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,509
(all screaming)

757
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:26,773
I had to do it!

758
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,374
Jack! (groans)
You maced us!

759
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,552
Stop including me!

760
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,751
(screaming)

761
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,156
(glass breaks)

762
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,611
BRENDAN: I'll find us a hotel.

763
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,614
Next train's in 24 hours.

764
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,650
This just came in.

765
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,742
Why are your eyes all red?

766
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,344
Why is your head so bald?

767
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,549
Because I have alopecia.

768
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,091
Oh, yeah.

769
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,094
That's like albino, right?

770
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,221
Not really.

771
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,299
Jack maced us.

772
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:26,607
Was I just mean to Brendan?

773
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,302
He's not coming back.

774
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:29,743
He just quit.

775
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,111
He did, didn't he?

776
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,740
Can we at least get our snake back?

777
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,409
It's dead.

778
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,146
You killed him?

779
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,554
Your fake tooth's gone.

780
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,559
Fuck.

781
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,458
(mutters in German)

782
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,894
What did you say?

783
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,760
Shame on you.

784
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,730
Did you get maced, too?

785
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,275
No, I'm crying.

786
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,019
What's wrong with you?

787
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,590
Let me think about that.

788
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,592
I'll tell you
the next time I see you.

789
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:20,221
Sure, tell me then.

790
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,296
Thanks for using me.

791
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,372
You're welcome.

792
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,778
Good-bye, Rita.

793
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,908
FRANCIS: So long, Sweet Lime.

794
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:57,701
(metal clangs)

795
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,364
(rocks clang against metal)

796
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,057
"Dear boys..."

797
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,594
WOMAN'S VOICE: <i>Bad timing.</i>

798
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,994
<i>This morning I received the</i>
<i>details of your travel plans</i>

799
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:31,590
<i>in a document sent to me</i>
<i>from a man named Brendan.</i>

800
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,567
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>I cannot receive you now.</i>

801
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,196
<i>A neighboring village requires</i>
<i>our urgent assistance</i>

802
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,604
<i>due to an emergency,</i>
<i>not to mention the recent</i>

803
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,337
<i>arrival of a man-eating tiger</i>
<i>in the region.</i>

804
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:42,878
<i>I suggest you come</i>
<i>in the spring</i>

805
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,504
<i>when you'll be safe with me.</i>

806
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,207
<i>You must know how sad I am</i>

807
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,546
<i>to experience this long separation.</i>

808
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:51,485
<i>I hope you'll eventually</i>
<i>understand and forgive me.</i>

809
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,318
<i>God bless you and keep you with</i>
<i>Mary's benevolent guidance</i>

810
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,290
<i>in the light of Christ's</i>
<i>enduring grace.</i>

811
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,554
<i>All my love, your mother,</i>

812
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:00,721
<i>Sister Patricia Whitman.</i>

813
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,822
FRANCIS:
That sounds like bullshit to me.

814
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,366
- JACK: Me, too.
- PETER: Obviously.

815
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,130
She's trying to sell us
a vacuum cleaner.

816
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,778
(soft music plays)

817
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,211
Let's get high.

818
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:36,993
I'm sorry.

819
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:40,829
Me, too.

820
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:42,735
I wasn't trying to aim
for your face.

821
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,674
Doesn't matter,
it's already demolished.

822
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,303
Let's just go home.

823
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,938
She doesn't want to see us anyway.

824
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:55,041
You don't think so?

825
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:57,052
Not even on some primordial level?

826
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,554
No.

827
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,750
FRANCIS:
She's been disappearing all our lives.

828
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,092
We weren't raised
to be treated like that.

829
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:09,165
It's just not done.

830
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,758
Maybe this is how
it's supposed to happen.

831
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,997
It could all be part of it.

832
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,871
Maybe this is where the
spiritual journey ends.

833
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,172
You read the instructions,

834
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,911
right?

835
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,381
Okay, let's do it.

836
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,355
I'm gonna go over here.

837
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,487
Yeah, g... that's good,
get on the rock. Yeah.

838
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,326
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.
- Peter, you get... Yeah.

839
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:43,990
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

840
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,432
- Ah! Oh!
- Shalom.

841
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:49,768
(all chanting gibberish)

842
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:52,467
Okay, that's it.
That's it.

843
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:53,702
Okay.

844
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,779
(quietly): Well, all right.

845
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,721
Which direction did yours go?

846
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,986
What do you mean?

847
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,321
Your feathers.

848
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:12,895
Mine blew towards the mountains.

849
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,556
That's not right- it's
not supposed to get blown away.

850
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,930
You're supposed
to blow <i>on</i> it... (blows)

851
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,400
And then bury it.

852
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,800
I didn't get that.

853
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,428
I still have mine.

854
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,938
You guys didn't do it right.

855
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,941
I asked you
if you read the instructions.

856
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,637
You did it wrong.

857
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,337
(sighs)

858
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,940
I tried my hardest.

859
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,815
I don't know what else to do.

860
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,554
I don't think Dad
would have hated it.

861
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,423
Did he really say
you were his favorite?

862
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:47,758
I don't know.

863
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,560
I could barely understand him.

864
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,827
He wasn't really breathing.

865
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:53,664
I wonder if the three of us

866
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,965
could have been friends
in real life.

867
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,564
Not as brothers but as people.

868
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:02,338
Well, we probably would've had
a better chance, I guess.

869
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,911
Let's make another agreement:

870
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:09,178
We'll all come back here
in the spring when...

871
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,550
We're never coming back here.

872
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:14,954
Let's just find an airport
and go our separate ways.

873
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:20,661
Wouldn't it sound great
if you could hear a train

874
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,665
going by off in the
distance right now?

875
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:26,395
- Not really.
- Probably be annoying.

876
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,484
(boy shouts in Hindi)

877
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,218
Look at these assholes.

878
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,586
(boy shouts in Hindi)

879
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,793
That's gonna tip over.

880
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,261
(yelling)

881
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:56,655
Go!

882
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:00,032
(boys shouting)

883
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,433
Get the little one.

884
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,040
Francis!

885
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,169
(grunting): Grab him!

886
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:15,175
Don't let go of me.

887
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,946
PETER: He's all tangled up.

888
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,558
(grunts, gasps)

889
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:31,361
Hang on, hang on.
I got you.

890
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,400
(loud grunt)

891
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,527
PETER: I can't get him out!

892
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,402
(boy shouts)

893
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,909
- (loud snap)
- Peter!

894
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:45,076
(thunder rumbling)

895
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,309
(amplified heartbeat)

896
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,584
He's all bloody!

897
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:55,658
(amplified heartbeat
accelerates)

898
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,994
- (heartbeat stops)
- He's dead. He's dead.

899
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,996
- He's dead?
- The rocks killed him.

900
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,326
You're bleeding like crazy.

901
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,161
FRANCIS: Peter! You okay?

902
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,167
I didn't save mine.

903
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,237
(panting)

904
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,700
What's his name?

905
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,786
(animal bleats)

906
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,856
(bell tinkling)

907
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,750
(speaking Hindi)

908
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,272
- Papa! Papa!
- Hey!

909
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,432
(boy speaks
frantically)

910
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,840
(man speaking Hindi)

911
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:52,081
(train whistle blowing
in distance)

912
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,049
(speaking angrily in Hindi)

913
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,315
(quietly): No.

914
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:06,763
(people speaking Hindi
in distance)

915
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,048
(quiet chatter in Hindi)

916
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,916
(men speaking Hindi)

917
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,769
(many women wailing)

918
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:56,846
(women continue wailing)

919
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,117
(men speaking Hindi)

920
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,759
(man speaks Hindi)

921
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,886
Thank you.

922
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:15,226
(woman speaks quietly)

923
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,206
(speaks Hindi)

924
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,847
(birds chirping)

925
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:00,943
(man singing in Hindi
in distance)

926
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,384
(speaks Hindi)

927
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,454
(baby cries briefly)

928
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,492
(speaks Hindi)

929
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:21,295
(long sigh)

930
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,366
(wind whistling)

931
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,917
PETER:
Can you explain that I almost had him?

932
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:54,630
I lost him when
we went off the rocks.

933
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,289
He was too slippery.

934
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,425
I had him the whole
rest of the time.

935
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:02,334
I want them to know that.

936
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,878
(bus idling)

937
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,115
What you doing in this place?

938
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:23,749
Well, originally, I guess,

939
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,021
we came here
on a spiritual journey,

940
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,461
but that didn't really pan out.

941
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:29,998
(door opens)

942
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,069
(music playing quietly,
indistinct chatter)

943
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,825
We're invited to the funeral.

944
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,762
Okay.

945
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:13,442
(guitar strumming
mid-tempo intro)

946
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:19,742
#Where you going? #

947
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:22,010
# I don't mind #

948
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:26,953
# I've killed my world
and I've killed my time #

949
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,218
# So where do I go? #

950
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,658
#What will I see? #

951
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:36,198
# I see many people
coming after me #

952
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:39,132
# So where are you going to? #

953
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:41,328
# I don't mind #

954
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,235
# If I live too long #

955
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,104
# I'm afraid I'll die #

956
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,268
# So I will follow you #

957
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,608
#Wherever you go #

958
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,579
# If your offered hand #

959
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:55,879
# Is still open to me #

960
00:55:55,985 --> 00:56:00,513
# Strangers on this road
we are on #

961
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:03,751
#We are not two,
we are one #

962
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:14,836
# So you've been
where I've just come #

963
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:19,102
# From the land
that brings losers on #

964
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:23,771
# So we will share
this road we walk #

965
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,476
#And mind our mouths
and beware our talk #

966
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:33,045
#Till peace we find,
tell you what I'll do #

967
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:37,456
#All the things I own,
I will share with you #

968
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,929
#And if I feel tomorrow
like I feel today #

969
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,261
#We'll take what we want #

970
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:47,928
#And give the rest away... #

971
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:50,971
(orchestral classical music
playing quietly)

972
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,401
I can't believe you just said that.

973
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:56,877
Why not?
It's the truth.

974
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,345
He didn't really mean it.

975
00:56:58,448 --> 00:56:59,881
I think you're all
equally grief-stricken.

976
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,348
Let's just leave it at that.

977
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:02,679
When does Mom get in?

978
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:03,912
She's going straight there

979
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,079
from the airport.

980
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,854
I want to pick up the car.

981
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,859
We're already late.

982
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,360
Tell the driver

983
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,488
- to take a right.
- We don't have time.

984
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,567
- Let's do this later.
- No. I want to get it now.

985
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:19,965
Uh, excuse me?

986
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:22,128
I'm sorry, uh, we're gonna
need to make a stop first

987
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:23,637
at this address.

988
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:29,073
Go ahead- I'll be right behind you.

989
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,010
I think we should wait for you.

990
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,081
Why?

991
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:36,243
Francis.

992
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,820
Tell them we'll be there
in five minutes.

993
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,021
(bell buzzes)

994
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,005
MAN: Hey, hey...

995
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,301
Hey.

996
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,606
Yeah, we're here to pick up
Mr. Whitman's car.

997
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,475
No, Mr. Whitman's car is not ready.

998
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:05,946
What do you mean, it's not ready?

999
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,108
No, we're waiting for...
a part.

1000
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,981
- A part?
- Yeah.

1001
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:11,883
Uh, I left a message
with his secretary.

1002
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:12,977
No, no, no, that's crazy.

1003
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:14,488
This car's been here
for three months.

1004
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:15,649
He can't wait any longer.

1005
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:16,884
He'll have to wait another week.

1006
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:17,960
Uh, I left a message.

1007
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,358
Yeah, he didn't get the message.

1008
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,953
Mr. Whitman is dead.
You understand?

1009
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:26,733
Jimmy Whitman?

1010
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,235
Yeah.

1011
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,862
What happened to him?

1012
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,941
He got hit by a taxi.

1013
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,167
And it killed him?

1014
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,800
Yeah.

1015
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,402
His change was scattered
all over 72nd Street.

1016
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:42,250
Oh, you're his sons.

1017
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,843
Right. And we're gonna
take this car

1018
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,819
to his funeral, which
we're late for, right now.

1019
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:47,981
Where are the keys?

1020
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:49,786
Peter, we'll come back
later and get the car.

1021
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:50,882
It's not ready, right?

1022
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:53,462
It's not ready.

1023
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,527
- (no audible dialogue)
- (indistinct chatter over radio)

1024
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,476
(engine sputtering)

1025
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:12,912
(backfire)

1026
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:15,678
The battery's dead, too.

1027
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:20,315
FRANCIS: There it is.

1028
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:22,584
That's the other one.
We found it.

1029
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,853
We're still waiting for a part
to come in from Stuttgart.

1030
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:25,893
Where's a battery charger?

1031
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:26,962
What are you doing?

1032
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,428
- This one's mine.
- No, it's not.

1033
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,897
We need to take it home and
enter it in the inventory.

1034
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,991
I'm taking this suitcase.

1035
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,763
You going somewhere?

1036
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,330
I don't know.

1037
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,273
Where's the goddamn battery charger?

1038
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:41,604
Ah, aha!

1039
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,338
Guess he didn't read
my book in time.

1040
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:45,073
What do you mean?
In time for what?

1041
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,239
The envelope's never been opened.

1042
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,146
Oh, you mean when
he was still alive.

1043
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:56,558
WOMAN (over speaker):
Phone call for a Francis Whitman.

1044
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:01,426
Hello.

1045
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:02,930
ALICE: They want to start.

1046
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,795
Send the car back for us.
The battery's dead.

1047
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:06,232
They can only wait ten minutes.

1048
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:07,928
There's another service after us.

1049
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,369
Okay, well, we might not
make it, then.

1050
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,464
I guess just...

1051
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:14,566
tell 'em to go fuck themselves.

1052
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:16,508
Hold the line.

1053
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,944
No, you're going to start
when they get here,

1054
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,105
not one second before.

1055
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,706
Is that perfectly clear?
Is that perfectly clear?

1056
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:22,842
Try to be quick.

1057
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:23,976
Okay.

1058
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,452
- Wait a second.
- Yes?

1059
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:27,921
I spoke to your mother.
She's not coming.

1060
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,423
She didn't get on the plane.

1061
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:30,924
Why not?

1062
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:32,688
I don't know. I'm sorry.

1063
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:37,528
Will you tell Peter and Jack, so
they don't expect to see her?

1064
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,067
Yeah.

1065
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:40,999
ALICE: I'm sorry.

1066
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:43,732
Thanks, Alice.

1067
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,364
Thank you.

1068
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,705
- RECEPTIONIST: You're welcome.
- (shouts)

1069
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,370
Put it in second.

1070
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,675
Put it in second!

1071
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:55,484
Pop it!

1072
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:57,314
(horn honking)

1073
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,821
Watch it, asshole!

1074
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,321
What do you want?

1075
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:06,452
Are you kidding me?

1076
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:07,529
Fuck, no.

1077
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,325
You get back in your car right now.

1078
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:11,024
Get back in that car!

1079
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:26,645
This isn't gonna work.

1080
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,944
- Let's put the cover back on it.
- Let's go.

1081
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,316
FRANCIS: Come on. Steer it in.

1082
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,530
Let's go.

1083
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,548
Who called?

1084
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:08,385
Alice.

1085
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,788
What'd she say?

1086
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,086
They're waiting.

1087
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,821
Mom there?

1088
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,658
Not yet.

1089
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,975
(chanting in Hindi)

1090
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:59,169
(chanting continues)

1091
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:11,050
(flames crackling)

1092
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,104
Hey...

1093
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:36,769
hey, help him up.

1094
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,139
You okay?

1095
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:51,326
(music playing softly)

1096
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,454
(footsteps)

1097
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,440
(bus horn honking)

1098
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:52,885
(bus approaching)

1099
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,597
(brakes hissing)

1100
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:12,239
(praying in Hindi)

1101
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,111
Let me help you.

1102
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:28,779
(Indian pop song playing)

1103
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:01,086
##

1104
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:07,457
(whistles)

1105
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:18,368
(metal detector warbling)

1106
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,981
Whitman.

1107
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,421
The flight boards in 25 minutes.

1108
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:38,015
Let's set aside the next ten
minutes to use as free time.

1109
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,095
Do a little shopping,
have a snack,

1110
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:42,426
make a phone call, and then
we'll meet in the bathroom

1111
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:45,762
next to that statue over there
at about a quarter after,

1112
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:48,098
get cleaned up,
brush your teeth,

1113
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,900
have a shave or what have you,
and in our last five minutes

1114
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,407
we'll sit quietly in
that little shrine over there,

1115
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,704
say a prayer and think about
everything we've been through.

1116
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:59,008
(indistinct P.A. Announcements
in Hindi)

1117
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:02,982
Three, please.

1118
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:05,053
(sighs)

1119
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:07,418
I love the way this country smells.

1120
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,717
I'll never forget it.

1121
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:10,485
It's kind of spicy.

1122
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:12,754
Who's he talking to?

1123
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,064
I think he's trying
to rehire Brendan.

1124
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,396
He said he's gonna
offer him a 50% raise

1125
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,663
plus some medical benefits
to help with his albino disease

1126
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:24,035
or whatever it's called.

1127
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,072
How'd it go?

1128
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:26,971
He's gonna think about it.

1129
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:29,203
He's gotta get hired
back, because otherwise

1130
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,609
I'm probably just a bad person.

1131
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,341
And in some ways I
feel like Brendan

1132
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:36,043
might be my...
friend maybe.

1133
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:37,585
I'll be right back.

1134
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,518
He didn't really kill
our snake, did he?

1135
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,527
I mean, it's gotta be
against his religion.

1136
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:47,857
I bet he just sent him

1137
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:49,157
out into the desert, which is...

1138
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:50,391
actually closer to his
natural habitat.

1139
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:51,898
Who's he talking to?

1140
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,394
Probably checking his
ex-girlfriend's messages again.

1141
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:57,995
I thought we made an agreement.

1142
01:07:58,107 --> 01:07:59,699
Why didn't you stop him?

1143
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,676
What'd you find out this time?

1144
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:08,113
She's gonna meet me in Italy.

1145
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:09,343
Oh, man, that's terrible.

1146
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:11,386
I know.

1147
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:12,886
I'll be right back.

1148
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:20,191
Let's look at the itinerary.

1149
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:23,265
(woman speaking on P.A.,
indistinct)

1150
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:39,647
Is that from Sweet Lime?

1151
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:40,908
Who's he talking to?

1152
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:42,313
I didn't say that.

1153
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:44,682
I didn't want... Hello?

1154
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,290
Alice, I guess.

1155
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,357
It's a boy.

1156
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,400
It got born already?

1157
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:01,492
It's gonna be a boy.

1158
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:02,764
She had a sonogram or something.

1159
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:03,770
It's a boy?

1160
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:04,840
That's incredible!

1161
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:05,907
- Wow!
- Yeah.

1162
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,304
Why were you yelling?

1163
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,076
She's angry 'cause I didn't tell
her I was coming here.

1164
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:17,084
Ever?
Until just now?

1165
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:18,483
Yeah.

1166
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:20,418
But I explained everything.

1167
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:25,620
It's actually kind of lucky
'cause I got this vest.

1168
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,491
It can work with either one,

1169
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:29,621
but I think it's better for a man.

1170
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:33,691
(chuckles)

1171
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:36,270
Here, he can inherit this.

1172
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,765
It's from me and Jack.

1173
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,708
Thanks.

1174
01:09:57,893 --> 01:09:59,520
Can I use those scissors?

1175
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,586
(jet passes overhead)

1176
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:02,288
I guess I've still got
some more healing to do.

1177
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,992
You're getting there, though.

1178
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,155
Anyway, it's
definitely gonna add

1179
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,062
a lot of character to you.

1180
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,421
What should we pray for now?

1181
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:52,406
(engine roar drowns out
conversation)

1182
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:21,464
##

1183
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,466
(wind whistling)

1184
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:12,445
Didn't you get my letter?

1185
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,784
I told you to come back
in the spring.

1186
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,653
Should we go?

1187
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:17,691
Of course not.

1188
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:21,092
Welcome, my beautiful boys.

1189
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:24,893
Francie, Peter, LittleJack.

1190
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,200
What happened to your face?

1191
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:34,799
I smashed into a hill
on purpose on my motorcycle.

1192
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,277
I'm sorry to hear that.

1193
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,938
There's so many things

1194
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,141
we don't know about
each other, aren't there?

1195
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:45,685
Who's this?

1196
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:48,951
That's Oberoi.
He got us here.

1197
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:50,649
(both converse in Tibetan)

1198
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:51,851
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

1199
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,154
What are you saying to him?

1200
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,196
I'm telling him
to lock up your horses.

1201
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:56,355
There's a tiger.

1202
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:57,693
Really? We thought
that was bullshit.

1203
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,234
You call that bullshit?

1204
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:05,438
He ate one of the Sister's brothers.

1205
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:07,270
(brothers laugh)

1206
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:08,843
I'm not kidding.

1207
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,242
# Praise him #

1208
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:16,750
# Praise him, praise him
in the morning #

1209
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:21,050
# Praise him
when the sun goes down #

1210
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:25,616
# Love him, love him #

1211
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:30,494
# Love him in the morning,
love him in the noontime #

1212
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:34,865
# Love him, love him. #

1213
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:36,493
(bell tolling)

1214
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,941
What do we want for breakfast?

1215
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,482
Jack, you'll like
the porridge,

1216
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:51,576
Peter, fresh mango, and
cornflakes for you, Francie.

1217
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,178
Now who wants scrambled
eggs? Raise your hand.

1218
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:58,957
What's on fire in that
hideous little flowerpot?

1219
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:00,289
Alice made that.

1220
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:01,726
Oh, it's darling.

1221
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,161
Tell her I said so.

1222
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:04,425
Okay.
You want one?

1223
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,091
Of course I do.

1224
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:09,932
# Everybody knows #

1225
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:12,336
# But don't play with me #

1226
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:13,567
(music box tinkling)

1227
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,337
# 'Cause you're playing
with fire #

1228
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,077
#Your mother, she's... #

1229
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:24,517
PETER: Mom?

1230
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:25,587
Uh-huh?

1231
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:28,955
There's one last thing.

1232
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:43,471
I want to tell you about my son.

1233
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:44,834
What son?

1234
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,736
The one I'm gonna have next month.

1235
01:15:48,537 --> 01:15:49,936
Well, you should be with Alice.

1236
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:52,234
You should have been
at Dad's funeral.

1237
01:15:52,341 --> 01:15:55,504
So that's why you came here.

1238
01:15:55,611 --> 01:15:57,738
We came here because we miss you.

1239
01:15:57,847 --> 01:15:59,508
I miss you, too.

1240
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:01,674
But why didn't you
come to Dad's funeral?

1241
01:16:02,785 --> 01:16:05,049
Because I didn't want to.

1242
01:16:06,722 --> 01:16:09,190
Why are we talking this way?

1243
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:10,952
What's wrong with us?

1244
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:11,958
We should be celebrating.

1245
01:16:12,061 --> 01:16:13,528
What are you doing here?

1246
01:16:13,629 --> 01:16:15,563
I live here.

1247
01:16:15,664 --> 01:16:16,688
These people need me.

1248
01:16:16,799 --> 01:16:18,494
What about us?

1249
01:16:26,642 --> 01:16:28,542
You're talking to her.

1250
01:16:28,644 --> 01:16:30,839
You're talking to someone else.

1251
01:16:30,946 --> 01:16:32,345
You're not talking to me.

1252
01:16:32,448 --> 01:16:34,541
I don't know the answers
to these questions

1253
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:37,084
and I don't see myself this way.

1254
01:16:37,186 --> 01:16:38,118
Listen.

1255
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:41,451
I'm sorry we lost your father.

1256
01:16:42,858 --> 01:16:45,952
We'll never get over it,
but it's okay.

1257
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:48,222
There are greater forces at work.

1258
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:54,166
Yes, the past happened,
but it's over, isn't it?

1259
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:55,999
Not for us.

1260
01:17:03,145 --> 01:17:05,545
I told you not to come here.

1261
01:17:16,091 --> 01:17:18,559
Maybe we could express
ourselves more fully

1262
01:17:18,661 --> 01:17:21,653
if we say it without words.

1263
01:17:26,802 --> 01:17:29,236
Should we try that?

1264
01:17:31,373 --> 01:17:33,307
##

1265
01:17:39,048 --> 01:17:42,074
#Well, you've got
your diamond #

1266
01:17:42,184 --> 01:17:46,120
#And you've got
your pretty clothes #

1267
01:17:46,222 --> 01:17:50,454
#And the chauffeur drives
your cars #

1268
01:17:50,559 --> 01:17:54,620
#You let everybody know #

1269
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:58,257
# But don't play with me #

1270
01:17:58,367 --> 01:18:00,733
# 'Cause you're playing
with fire #

1271
01:18:04,473 --> 01:18:07,636
#Your mother,
she's an heiress #

1272
01:18:07,743 --> 01:18:10,769
# Owns a block
in St. John's Wood #

1273
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,211
(thunder crashing)

1274
01:18:12,314 --> 01:18:17,718
#And your father'd be there
with her #

1275
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:20,983
# If he only could #

1276
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:24,423
# But don't play with me #

1277
01:18:24,526 --> 01:18:26,084
# 'Cause you're playing
with fire #

1278
01:18:26,195 --> 01:18:27,856
(snake hissing)

1279
01:18:39,675 --> 01:18:43,167
# Her old man took
her diamonds #

1280
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:47,739
#And tiaras by the score #

1281
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:51,911
# Now she gets her kicks
in Stepney #

1282
01:18:52,021 --> 01:18:56,481
# Not in Knightsbridge anymore #

1283
01:18:56,592 --> 01:19:00,289
# So don't you play with me #

1284
01:19:00,396 --> 01:19:02,887
# 'Cause you're playing
with fire #

1285
01:19:05,501 --> 01:19:09,130
# So don't you play with me #

1286
01:19:09,238 --> 01:19:12,230
# 'Cause you're playing
with fire #

1287
01:19:12,341 --> 01:19:14,241
(tiger growling)

1288
01:19:14,343 --> 01:19:17,904
# So don't you play with me #

1289
01:19:18,013 --> 01:19:21,210
# 'Cause you're playing
with fire. #

1290
01:19:21,317 --> 01:19:23,012
All right, let's make an agreement.

1291
01:19:23,118 --> 01:19:25,313
A: We'll get an early start
tomorrow morning

1292
01:19:25,421 --> 01:19:27,548
and try to enjoy
each other's company here

1293
01:19:27,656 --> 01:19:29,180
in this beautiful place.

1294
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:31,623
B: We'll stop feeling sorry
for ourselves.

1295
01:19:31,727 --> 01:19:33,319
It's not very attractive.

1296
01:19:33,429 --> 01:19:35,727
C: We'll make our plans
for the future.

1297
01:19:35,831 --> 01:19:36,798
Can we agree to that?

1298
01:19:36,899 --> 01:19:38,127
- Sure.
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1299
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:44,762
To be continued.

1300
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:01,979
(birds chirping)

1301
01:20:05,394 --> 01:20:06,759
Good morning.

1302
01:20:06,862 --> 01:20:08,591
She's gone.

1303
01:20:08,697 --> 01:20:10,028
What?

1304
01:20:10,132 --> 01:20:11,759
She's gone.

1305
01:20:11,867 --> 01:20:14,427
I was still asleep,
but Oberoi saw her go.

1306
01:20:17,539 --> 01:20:18,767
Peter.

1307
01:20:18,874 --> 01:20:19,966
What?

1308
01:20:20,075 --> 01:20:21,269
She's gone.

1309
01:20:21,377 --> 01:20:22,844
Who?

1310
01:20:25,614 --> 01:20:28,139
She's gone?

1311
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:29,615
Where?

1312
01:20:29,718 --> 01:20:31,117
They couldn't say.

1313
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:33,245
They just said she
goes away sometimes.

1314
01:20:33,355 --> 01:20:35,755
She left our breakfast
in the doorway.

1315
01:21:46,728 --> 01:21:48,286
Whoo!

1316
01:21:56,071 --> 01:21:57,538
Zip!

1317
01:22:07,015 --> 01:22:08,482
Pshew!

1318
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:54,187
I'm working on a new short story.

1319
01:22:54,296 --> 01:22:56,628
I wrote the ending, but I
don't know how it starts.

1320
01:22:56,732 --> 01:22:58,199
Read us what you got.

1321
01:22:59,568 --> 01:23:01,502
"'Whatever happens
in the end,' she said,

1322
01:23:01,603 --> 01:23:03,628
"'I don't want to lose
you as my friend.'

1323
01:23:03,739 --> 01:23:04,763
"He looked into her eyes.

1324
01:23:04,873 --> 01:23:06,397
"'I promise I will never
be your friend,

1325
01:23:06,508 --> 01:23:08,169
"no matter what, ever.'

1326
01:23:08,277 --> 01:23:09,574
"Her voice cracked.

1327
01:23:09,678 --> 01:23:11,475
"'Lf we fuck, I'm gonna
feel like shit tomorrow.'

1328
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:12,842
"'That's okay with me,' he said.

1329
01:23:12,948 --> 01:23:14,472
"He lifted her shirt over her head.

1330
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:15,982
"'I love you,' she said.

1331
01:23:16,084 --> 01:23:17,517
"'I never hurt you on purpose.'

1332
01:23:17,619 --> 01:23:18,984
"He nodded.
'I don't care.'

1333
01:23:19,087 --> 01:23:22,056
He would not be going to Italy."

1334
01:23:22,157 --> 01:23:23,647
That sound okay?

1335
01:23:23,759 --> 01:23:26,227
Yeah. It's hard for me
to judge the ending

1336
01:23:26,328 --> 01:23:28,057
without knowing the rest of it.

1337
01:23:28,163 --> 01:23:29,892
I like how mean you are.

1338
01:23:29,998 --> 01:23:31,829
Well, the characters are all...

1339
01:23:33,335 --> 01:23:34,962
Thanks.

1340
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:42,877
That's our train.

1341
01:23:52,187 --> 01:23:53,654
Hurry!

1342
01:23:57,559 --> 01:24:00,687
Dad's bags aren't gonna make it!

1343
01:24:00,796 --> 01:24:02,058
(chuckling)

1344
01:24:02,164 --> 01:24:04,792
(rock song playing)

1345
01:24:06,902 --> 01:24:08,870
# I know a man,
he's a powerful man #

1346
01:24:08,971 --> 01:24:11,838
# Got the people in his power
in the palm of his hand #

1347
01:24:16,712 --> 01:24:19,272
# He started at the bottom
and he worked his way up #

1348
01:24:19,381 --> 01:24:21,815
# Now he's never gonna stop
until he reaches the top #

1349
01:24:26,188 --> 01:24:29,453
# It's the same old story #

1350
01:24:33,028 --> 01:24:35,963
# It's the same old dream #

1351
01:24:36,064 --> 01:24:41,161
# It's power, man, power, man,
and all that it can bring #

1352
01:24:44,006 --> 01:24:46,372
# If you want your money,
better stand in the line #

1353
01:24:46,475 --> 01:24:48,238
# But you'll only end up
picking up #

1354
01:24:48,343 --> 01:24:50,311
#The nickels and dimes. #

1355
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,455
(knocking on door)

1356
01:25:05,327 --> 01:25:06,726
Good morning. Whitman?

1357
01:25:06,828 --> 01:25:07,886
Uh-huh.

1358
01:25:07,996 --> 01:25:09,463
May I see your ticket,
please?

1359
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:15,932
Welcome aboard.

1360
01:25:16,038 --> 01:25:16,936
Thank you.

1361
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:18,006
Thank you.

1362
01:25:18,106 --> 01:25:19,596
Sweet lime?

1363
01:25:21,343 --> 01:25:22,810
Why not?

1364
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,429
Why don't you hang onto mine?

1365
01:25:50,005 --> 01:25:52,098
It's safer if you keep them.

1366
01:26:07,823 --> 01:26:10,223
Let's go get a drink
and smoke a cigarette.

1367
01:26:10,325 --> 01:26:14,159
#Je m'baladais sur I'avenue
le coeur ouvert a I'inconnu #

1368
01:26:14,262 --> 01:26:18,426
#J'avais envie de dire bonjour
a n'importe qui #

1369
01:26:18,533 --> 01:26:22,731
# N'importe qui et ce fut toi,
je t'ai dit n'importe quoi #

1370
01:26:22,838 --> 01:26:27,070
# II suffisait de te parler,
pour t'apprivoiser #

1371
01:26:27,175 --> 01:26:35,844
#Aux Champs-Elyses,
aux Champs-Elyses #

1372
01:26:35,951 --> 01:26:40,149
#Au soleil, sous la pluie,
a midi ou a minuit #

1373
01:26:40,255 --> 01:26:44,351
# II y a tout ce que vous
voulez aux Champs-Elyses #

1374
01:26:44,459 --> 01:26:48,418
#Tu m'as dit "J'ai rendez-vous
dans un sous-sol avec des fous #

1375
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:52,796
# Qui vivent la guitare
a la main, du soir au matin" #

1376
01:26:52,901 --> 01:26:57,065
#Alors je t'ai accompagne,
on a chant, on a dans #

1377
01:26:57,172 --> 01:27:01,541
# Et I'on n'a meme
pas pens a s'embrasser #

1378
01:27:01,643 --> 01:27:10,073
#Aux Champs-Elyses,

# II y a tout ce que vous
voulez aux Champs-Elyses #

1381
01:27:36,011 --> 01:27:40,038
# Hier soir deux inconnus
et ce matin sur I'avenue #

1382
01:27:40,148 --> 01:27:44,209
# Deux amoureux tout tourdis
par la longue nuit #

1383
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:48,653
# Et de I'toile a la Concorde,
un orchestre a mille cordes #

1384
01:27:48,757 --> 01:27:53,353
#Tous les oiseaux du point
du jour chantent I'amour #

1385
01:27:53,462 --> 01:28:01,801
#Aux Champs-Elyses,
aux Champs-Elyses #

1386

#Aux Champs-Elyses,
aux Champs-Elyses #

1389
01:28:19,087 --> 01:28:23,353
#Au soleil, sous la pluie,
a midi ou a minuit #

1390
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:27,792
# II y a tout ce que vous
voulez aux Champs-Elyses #

1391
01:28:27,896 --> 01:28:35,598
#Aux Champs-Elyses,
aux Champs-Elyses... #

1392
01:28:35,704 --> 01:28:37,797
(song fades)

1393
01:28:37,906 --> 01:28:41,865
(melodic Indian music plays)

1394
01:29:11,873 --> 01:29:15,832
##

1395
01:29:45,907 --> 01:29:49,866

1399

(train whistle blows)
