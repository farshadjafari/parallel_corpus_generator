1
00:00:44,704 --> 00:00:47,730
This story is based on faith.

2
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:52,209
Faith which makes
the impossible happen.

3
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:56,507
Faith that renders
the impossible possible.

4
00:00:57,584 --> 00:01:02,715
This is one such story
bound by the chords of faith.

5
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:44,455
Here is Rs.10... Hey!
Where are you going?

6
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:48,297
Give me the extortion money
or I'll have you sacked!

7
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:50,268
Keep some money or you
will lose your job.

8
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:56,175
Put it in there.

9
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:16,395
Karan Singh and Arjun Singh,
put my extortion money.

10
00:02:17,897 --> 00:02:21,560
- Don't cut our money today.
- What is so special today?

11
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:24,927
- That is a secret.
- What secret?

12
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:28,532
- We'll tell you later.
- Don't cut Rs.2.

13
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:31,043
Keep the entire
day's wage tomorrow.

14
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:35,410
Is that so? I trust you
because you are Durga's sons.

15
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:39,740
But don't go back on
your word tomorrow.

16
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:43,846
Rs.20 for me tomorrow!

17
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:46,687
Father, it is Sunday tomorrow.
It is a holiday.

18
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:48,087
Good-bye!

19
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,354
Have you sprung from
the skies, buddy?

20
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:55,057
Never mind that. Just tell me
how much the bangles are worth.

21
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:57,594
Why must you buy bangles?

22
00:02:58,104 --> 00:03:00,868
Don't bother about that. Just tell
us how much the bangles cost.

23
00:03:01,774 --> 00:03:03,401
- Show me that.
- No. This green one.

24
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:06,505
- These red bangles.
- These golden ones.

25
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:11,047
- These colorful ones.
- They're indeed beautiful.

26
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:06,830
- I win, right Mom?
- No! I've won!

27
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,736
You win or lose in
a contest, my sons.

28
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:15,045
And it's only
enemies who compete.

29
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:18,382
- I touched your feet first.
- No! I did!

30
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,308
- I did!
- Stop it.

31
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:24,116
You're still racing
against each other!

32
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,316
Neither are you ahead...
nor are you trailing.

33
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:31,821
But my sons are ahead
of everyone else!

34
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,691
- We've got something for you.
- What is it?

35
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:37,932
- First shut your eyes.
- What for?

36
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:40,098
- Close your eyes! Go on!
- All right.

37
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:44,372
Open your eyes now.

38
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,072
You will wear bangles now,
like other women in the village.

39
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:54,249
We just can't bear to see
your hands so bare.

40
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:56,815
Extend your hand, mom.

41
00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,053
Come on, mom.

42
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:04,124
No! I can't wear those bangles.

43
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:06,657
Why not?

44
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:15,467
I can't wear bangles
at my age, silly boys.

45
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:17,431
I understand, mom!

46
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:20,511
She'll wear the bangles only
when Dad returns from the city.

47
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:23,406
- That's true, isn't it?
- It's so many years already.

48
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:25,707
He would've returned,
had he wished to.

49
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:28,452
- He has forgotten us!
- There's no word from him at all.

50
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:30,722
And you're always waiting for him!

51
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,953
Let's go and return
the bangles. Come on.

52
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,927
No... wait!

53
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:38,755
Give me those bangles...
give them to me.

54
00:05:46,873 --> 00:05:49,865
I will give these
bangles to your wives.

55
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:54,807
- But they were meant to...
- Go and bathe quickly.

56
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,607
We've got to visit
the temple.

57
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:14,962
- Greetings, madam.
- The accountant? You?

58
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:20,065
I've managed to reach here
with great difficulty.

59
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:23,841
Had someone seen me come here,
my life would be in danger.

60
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:26,105
But what brings you here
so late in the night?

61
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:30,648
The elder Thakur has
summoned you to the mansion.

62
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:31,979
Which mansion?

63
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:38,913
The one that shut the doors
on our good-fortune?

64
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:44,657
The mansion, whose wounds are
still raw in the heart?

65
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:52,266
Go away. I will never step
inside that mansion.

66
00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:55,129
Fulfilling a dying
man's last desire...

67
00:11:55,608 --> 00:11:58,668
...is considered to be
the greatest of noble deeds.

68
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:01,742
What? Is the landlord?

69
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:05,244
Yes. The landlord is
breathing his last.

70
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:08,086
His last wish is to see you.

71
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:14,551
But so long as the cursed Durjan
Singh casts his shadow there...

72
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,095
How can I go there?

73
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,125
Tomorrow's the festival
of Goddess Kali.

74
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:22,194
Durjan, with his brothers-in-law,
Nahar and Shamsher Singh...

75
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:24,034
...will be at the temple with
their families.

76
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:26,394
I will wait for you
outside the mansion.

77
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:29,232
- Please be there.
- Very well.

78
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:40,245
- Who was that man?
- And who's the old landlord?

79
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:48,859
I have kept a secret
from you for many years.

80
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:55,658
How was I to know that time
would one day stoke its fires?

81
00:12:58,504 --> 00:13:00,335
It's the story of my life...

82
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:05,472
...which I have always
kept a secret from you.

83
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,710
But I will have to tell
you the truth today.

84
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,775
I will tell you everything.

85
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:21,219
The old landlord is
your grandfather.

86
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:25,889
- What?!
- Our grandfather? The landlord?!

87
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:29,298
Yes. I am his daughter-in-law.

88
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,736
I was a poor woman.
And your father married me.

89
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:39,041
But the landlord was instigated
by Durjan Singh, his nephew...

90
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:41,777
...and he refused to accept
me as his daughter-in-law.

91
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:45,546
I was driven out of the mansion.

92
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:51,452
Your father found a job in
a school in the village.

93
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:56,260
We were happy in our own world,
despite our poverty.

94
00:13:57,396 --> 00:14:03,028
And your arrival brought more
joy and happiness in our lives.

95
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:09,469
But our happiness
soon turned to grief.

96
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,177
Durjan Singh dreamt of
inheriting the family riches.

97
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,245
And one night, out of
sheer treachery...

98
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:24,017
Durjan Singh killed your father!

99
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,221
What?! Was father...

100
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:31,856
You mean you have always?

101
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:40,961
Yes. To keep this tale
a secret, I concocted a story.

102
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:48,537
I didn't want you to feel orphaned.

103
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:58,321
How was I to know that someday my
past would come knocking on my door?

104
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:03,551
That I'd have to go to the
mansion which I have always loathed!

105
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:09,262
No. We will not go to the mansion
that has snatched our father!

106
00:15:10,102 --> 00:15:12,900
Yes. We won't as much as
step in the place...

107
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,733
...that has plunged you
in poverty and despair.

108
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,538
I know how the fires
of hatred are stoked...

109
00:15:23,148 --> 00:15:25,912
...when one is reminded of the
humiliation he has undergone.

110
00:15:26,986 --> 00:15:30,752
But I have always imparted to you
lessons in love and compassion.

111
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:32,713
Not hatred.

112
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:37,387
Hatred can only make man
and society, drift apart.

113
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:42,065
Hatred is the devil's shadow, my sons.

114
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:44,196
It's the devil's shadow!

115
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,794
Glory to Goddess Kali!

116
00:16:58,944 --> 00:16:59,933
Welcome, madam...

117
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:03,106
The landlord has been speaking
about you since morning.

118
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:06,348
He's longing to see
Karan and Arjun.

119
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,245
Please come in.

120
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:11,053
Welcome, daughter-in-law.

121
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,949
Please don't touch me...
I am a sinner!

122
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:21,492
No, father. That which happened
was part of our destiny.

123
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,801
No. It was my arrogance that
had eclipsed your destiny.

124
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,207
I thrust my own blood in
the fires of misfortune.

125
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:34,444
I should be severely punished.

126
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:38,514
A terrible death that no sinner
would have suffered so far!

127
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:41,280
Don't say that.

128
00:17:42,554 --> 00:17:46,752
The ointment of time heals
every wound inflicted by life.

129
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,960
Before I die, just once...

130
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:54,256
Won't you give me
the right to hug them?

131
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:58,735
Right? Our lives are for you.

132
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:00,869
Karan and Arjun are your children.

133
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,232
Go my children.

134
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:10,210
My children!

135
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,141
I'm truly unfortunate.

136
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:19,348
I couldn't play with you.

137
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:27,861
I'm returning the right I had
snatched away from you.

138
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,764
Now you are the
mistress of this mansion.

139
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:38,573
And your sons are its' heirs.

140
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:40,708
Take this.

141
00:18:45,717 --> 00:18:47,844
The body becomes useless in old age.

142
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:52,089
But you have ruined your life!

143
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:56,793
You poisoned my life!
Go away from here!

144
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,457
I didn't come to this
mansion to go away!

145
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:02,697
Every brick of this house is mine!

146
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,231
I served you all your life!

147
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:11,336
You tried to kill me every moment!

148
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,539
But I didn't die.

149
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:18,382
Because I had a debt to pay,
to give these kids their rights!

150
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,286
I won't give these beggars one penny!

151
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:27,982
Instead I'll give you and
this family of yours, death!

152
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:31,257
No! I bind you by oath.

153
00:19:33,332 --> 00:19:34,765
We don't want anything!

154
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:38,565
You may take everything.
We want nothing at all!

155
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,536
What are you saying?

156
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:50,447
You called me your daughter-in-law
and held my sons close to your heart.

157
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:53,241
We have got all the
wealth in the world.

158
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,581
We want nothing else.

159
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:58,081
Come on children.

160
00:20:06,898 --> 00:20:09,958
Brother-in-law, you left
these two snakes alive?

161
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:13,696
Snakes can raise their fangs anytime.

162
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:18,437
They are the young ones
of a snake not snakes.

163
00:20:19,778 --> 00:20:21,746
They haven't yet cut
their poison fangs.

164
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,940
Their father was the snake.

165
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:30,785
The sons will die at my hands
just as their father did!

166
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,884
What? You killed my son?

167
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,495
Yes. I did.

168
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:42,165
And his children too
will die at my hands.

169
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,803
- This can't happen!
- This will happen!

170
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:52,038
Because your entire family
is doomed to die at my hands!

171
00:20:53,278 --> 00:20:54,575
Look at this old man!

172
00:20:56,715 --> 00:21:00,276
You will see the dark shadow
of your death in my palm!

173
00:21:22,307 --> 00:21:23,831
Run!

174
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:25,837
Run children!

175
00:22:18,764 --> 00:22:19,788
Leave my sons!

176
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:23,494
- Leave my Karan and Arjun!
- Leave these little snakes?

177
00:22:25,504 --> 00:22:26,869
The game has just begun, old lady.

178
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,973
It will be great fun!

179
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:33,043
Look there, old lady!

180
00:22:39,684 --> 00:22:40,776
Look there!

181
00:22:56,301 --> 00:22:57,996
Stop it!

182
00:23:04,142 --> 00:23:04,972
You bite!

183
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:07,602
Mother!

184
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:14,714
Mother!

185
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:31,798
You hit my mother?

186
00:23:47,252 --> 00:23:48,514
Let's run away!

187
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:51,250
Run Arjun!

188
00:23:56,328 --> 00:23:58,694
I'm telling you to run!

189
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:22,344
Mother! My sons cannot die!

190
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:27,780
This cannot happen!

191
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:33,154
You are also a mother.

192
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:37,786
A mother can't destroy
another mother's womb!

193
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:45,768
My sons are the boon
given to me at your step!

194
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:50,033
You can't take back a
gift you've given once!

195
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,875
You will have to return my sons!

196
00:25:55,313 --> 00:25:57,372
Return my sons to me mother!

197
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:01,746
Return my sons to me mother!

198
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:06,119
Return my sons to me mother!

199
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:36,211
Push harder. Little more.

200
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:26,528
Ate his mother soon as he was born!

201
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,430
Now will you eat my liquor bottle?

202
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:33,636
I don't have money for my booze!
Where can I get cash for your milk?

203
00:27:34,713 --> 00:27:36,271
Don't cry son.

204
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:39,875
Our son will grow into a big man.

205
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:42,747
Even God will feel proud of him.

206
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:46,313
All thanks to Pestonbhai.

207
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:50,456
I work in his Riding Club
and eke out a living.

208
00:27:51,162 --> 00:27:53,323
It's the Lord who does everything.

209
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:57,298
Who knows maybe your son
will run my Riding Club tomorrow!

210
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,772
Brought booze?

211
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:08,769
I'm hungry. I've brought food.

212
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:13,141
Rascal! When small
you cried for milk!

213
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,984
And now for food!

214
00:28:16,888 --> 00:28:19,356
- Get me some booze!
- No, I won't!

215
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:22,383
Arguing with your father!

216
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,093
- Let go of my hand!
- No! First leave the bag!

217
00:28:27,465 --> 00:28:30,059
Little fellow but has
the strength of a horse!

218
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,961
- Won't leave me?
- Scoundrel!

219
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:41,245
What happened son?

220
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:44,281
He was stealing grams so I hit him.

221
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:46,808
Wow! What aim!

222
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:41,029
What happens to you suddenly?

223
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:42,670
Will you kill him?

224
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:47,471
Why are you hitting him?
He was fighting for you.

225
00:29:48,146 --> 00:29:51,513
This boy called you a drunk.
Therefore, Ajay thrashed him.

226
00:29:52,383 --> 00:29:54,078
Control your son.

227
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:57,952
Those who do not have mothers
turn out to be like this.

228
00:30:00,124 --> 00:30:01,216
Mother I will return!

229
00:30:01,993 --> 00:30:05,520
I am with you son!

230
00:30:06,164 --> 00:30:11,864
- I will return mother!
- There is no need to worry.

231
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:16,771
He is hallucinating.
It happens when the fever rises.

232
00:30:19,077 --> 00:30:20,908
Mother! Mother!

233
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:32,320
Priest.

234
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:41,895
Did you hear? Did you?

235
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:44,962
My son has called out to me!

236
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:50,737
They will come.
My Karan and Arjun will return!

237
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:54,901
I've been listening for 20 years.

238
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:57,041
That Karan and Arjun will come.

239
00:30:57,548 --> 00:31:02,178
But this world is such a place...

240
00:31:03,588 --> 00:31:08,218
Once destroyed the people of
this world never ever return.

241
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,354
Wait and see.

242
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:13,822
My Karan and Arjun will return!

243
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:16,761
They will definitely return!

244
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:21,130
Karan and Arjun will return?

245
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,507
Mad old woman!

246
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:27,368
My father, Durjan Singh, has
given them such a terrible death...

247
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:31,515
...that even God will think.
10 times before sending them here!

248
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:32,777
Move aside!

249
00:32:11,456 --> 00:32:12,320
Crazy old woman!

250
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:16,760
Looks like you still don't
believe your sons are dead.

251
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:22,457
Take this and garland
the photograph with it.

252
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:28,870
Look at it everyday so that you
are convinced your sons are no more.

253
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:32,204
This is from me.

254
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:34,072
From my side.

255
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,552
Priest, my son is going abroad.

256
00:32:53,965 --> 00:32:55,865
I've brought him here
for Mother's blessings.

257
00:32:57,068 --> 00:32:59,002
So that he returns
successful in his mission.

258
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:02,203
After tormenting one mother...

259
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:07,200
You are begging another
mother for her blessings?

260
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:13,477
You'll have to beg my sons.

261
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:17,712
Beg them for your lives.
To let you live.

262
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,316
Remember, these 3 garlands...

263
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:26,453
...if I don't garland
your corpses with these...

264
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:29,458
I'm not worthy of my name, Durga!

265
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:37,067
Remember this Durjan.

266
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,673
My sons will return!

267
00:33:41,612 --> 00:33:43,807
My Karan and Arjun will return!

268
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:47,847
Stupid woman!
How can the dead return?

269
00:33:49,754 --> 00:33:51,813
They will tear the
earth apart and come!

270
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,185
They will rip open the skies to come!

271
00:34:10,108 --> 00:34:11,336
That guy is finished!

272
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:12,740
Hit him!

273
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:08,829
You were great!

274
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:13,501
You've performed a miracle by
defeating the favorite Kalia! Look.

275
00:35:13,771 --> 00:35:15,102
A shower of cash!

276
00:35:15,706 --> 00:35:19,369
Here's your share. From today
you are the favorite here.

277
00:35:24,715 --> 00:35:28,549
Eunuch! You'll marry me?

278
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,053
I'll scramble your brains!

279
00:35:32,857 --> 00:35:36,816
Dad she's abusing us!

280
00:35:37,228 --> 00:35:38,160
Get lost!

281
00:35:39,564 --> 00:35:41,532
You won't ever find a groom like me!

282
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:47,170
You seem to live in this area.

283
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:49,603
Is she a girl or boy?

284
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:53,338
Whom are you asking?
I'll tell you what I am.

285
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:55,468
Run! Eunuch!

286
00:35:56,414 --> 00:36:01,181
Saw that? He was the fifth specimen.

287
00:36:02,086 --> 00:36:08,150
Before my Dad gives my hand
to somebody else...

288
00:36:08,926 --> 00:36:11,053
Hold my hand.

289
00:36:13,598 --> 00:36:18,365
He doesn't care about you but
you chase him like a fool.

290
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:21,497
What's special about him
that you only want him?

291
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:27,010
Dad he has what nobody else has.

292
00:36:28,446 --> 00:36:30,038
He slapped me once in childhood.

293
00:36:30,915 --> 00:36:33,383
On my cheek but it left
its' imprint on my heart.

294
00:36:34,385 --> 00:36:39,254
But the day you get slapped,
you'll forget finding grooms for me!

295
00:36:45,896 --> 00:36:48,091
No! It isn't nothing...
It's medicine.

296
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:54,368
Liquor in a medicine bottle?

297
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:58,835
I slog hard to buy medicines.

298
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,835
And you have this poison?

299
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:05,476
I want to save you
and you want to die?

300
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:08,348
There's still time. Change yourself!

301
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:20,492
Great! Simply superb!

302
00:37:49,694 --> 00:37:56,896
Fantastic or elastic, any girl
who comes here makes him her teacher.

303
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:07,604
How did you learn such excellent
horse riding and marksmanship?

304
00:38:08,512 --> 00:38:09,877
I put my heart into it and learnt it.

305
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:12,546
If you put your heart
into it, you too will learn.

306
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:15,376
His heart too is in it.

307
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:20,821
That's what I'm watching.
Daily she comes half an hour early.

308
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:26,252
What do I do? Since coming here,
I don't like being at home.

309
00:38:27,531 --> 00:38:29,226
Like a kite is pulled by its' string...

310
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:31,692
I'm in the same boat.

311
00:38:32,236 --> 00:38:34,170
Maybe that has afflicted you.

312
00:38:34,872 --> 00:38:36,669
- What?
- That.

313
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:44,606
But in just two meetings,
it has happened that Mogambo...

314
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:46,446
Who is Mogambo?

315
00:38:47,151 --> 00:38:48,743
My horse.

316
00:38:53,824 --> 00:38:56,622
Yes, I'm attracted to Mogambo
and somebody else too.

317
00:39:00,664 --> 00:39:02,598
Somebody else? Who?

318
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:07,426
- Really?
- Yes.

319
00:39:08,672 --> 00:39:10,037
- Swear.
- By me.

320
00:39:11,642 --> 00:39:17,877
I can see it in the eyes
but I want to hear it too.

321
00:39:18,883 --> 00:39:21,784
- With a kiss...
- With the catapult.

322
00:39:22,853 --> 00:39:24,946
How did this catapult
enter a love scene?

323
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:29,224
People love hearts and you
fell in love with a catapult?

324
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:32,587
You may have my catapult
if not my heart.

325
00:39:33,197 --> 00:39:36,166
- I don't know how to.
- You only know how to shoot arrows.

326
00:39:37,101 --> 00:39:38,159
I'll tech you.

327
00:39:38,903 --> 00:39:42,634
Hold this with the right hand
and this with the left.

328
00:39:44,241 --> 00:39:46,709
And pull it.

329
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:51,212
Now hold it tight.

330
00:39:54,752 --> 00:39:55,946
Who is this fat hippo?

331
00:39:56,821 --> 00:39:57,480
My body guard.

332
00:39:57,955 --> 00:40:01,186
Papa has sent him with me.

333
00:40:01,992 --> 00:40:04,153
If somebody troubles me, he LLs him.

334
00:40:05,162 --> 00:40:07,187
Yes, lame and mutilated. ********

335
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:10,997
Let's see.

336
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:15,403
Hippo, where are you going?

337
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:23,809
- You! - Yes, me.
- Baby! - Yes.

338
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:25,306
- What did you do?
- I kissed her.

339
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:26,944
Carefully.

340
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,452
Threw me!

341
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:33,518
Rascal!

342
00:40:58,582 --> 00:40:59,640
A hippo on a horse?

343
00:41:05,222 --> 00:41:06,086
Where's my gun?

344
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:20,135
Madam, looks like I'll have to
teach you something else

345
00:41:21,005 --> 00:41:22,973
...in addition to horse riding
and marksmanship. - What's that?

346
00:41:24,675 --> 00:41:27,473
One kisses on the lips not cheeks.

347
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,808
- Here.
- I'll learn that too.

348
00:41:35,419 --> 00:41:37,114
Where is the ruffian?
I won't spare him!

349
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:41,753
What does he think of himself?
Was it a terrible fight?

350
00:41:42,326 --> 00:41:47,389
The hearts liked each other.
And sliced the villain.

351
00:41:48,065 --> 00:41:49,760
My ears were smoking!

352
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:52,531
- You too would be...
- What? - Smoking.

353
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,334
- From where?
- Mouth, ear, nose...

354
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:57,903
I'll roast you if
you say another word!

355
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:01,608
Always mouthing double meaning
dialogues like Dada Kondke!

356
00:42:02,212 --> 00:42:03,474
Who was that ruffian son?

357
00:42:04,114 --> 00:42:06,048
A flower and a thorn.
I threw it out!

358
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:11,983
Well done son! As long as
your hand is on the head...

359
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:16,487
...of these hoodlums,
my Riding club will survive.

360
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:20,058
I am indebted to you.

361
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:24,529
No uncle. I am indebted to you.

362
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:29,062
You supported me after
my parents expired.

363
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,066
Loved me like a son.

364
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:33,006
Educated me, gave me a job.

365
00:42:33,611 --> 00:42:37,980
Your Dad was my friend.
Whatever I did was for friendship.

366
00:42:38,649 --> 00:42:41,880
Come on. It's time for your
horse riding students to come.

367
00:42:42,553 --> 00:42:45,386
I was talking about him.

368
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,158
He alone can take on a hundred.

369
00:42:48,826 --> 00:42:51,624
- If you meet him once...
- I'll meet him.

370
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:54,824
You've come back child?

371
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:57,725
Place the mug high.

372
00:42:59,803 --> 00:43:02,271
- A little higher.
- Come on. Here.

373
00:43:04,675 --> 00:43:07,542
- What childishness is this?
- Catapult.

374
00:43:08,278 --> 00:43:10,109
I've been practicing but
I can't get my aim right.

375
00:43:10,748 --> 00:43:17,415
You went to learn riding.
So where did this come from?

376
00:43:18,455 --> 00:43:22,118
What one plans never happens
and what is not planned does.

377
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,321
And what you never think of
happens some times.

378
00:43:24,828 --> 00:43:27,126
I mean it was great!

379
00:43:31,402 --> 00:43:32,562
Did you follow what she said?

380
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,469
Yes. I'm not so stupid.

381
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:51,514
- Good day sir.
- Whenever I leave my mansion...

382
00:43:52,656 --> 00:43:56,956
I think of one other world,
the world of our friendship.

383
00:43:58,962 --> 00:44:04,161
This friendship is soon
going to turn into relation.

384
00:44:05,402 --> 00:44:08,428
Your son Suraj is going
to become my son-in-law.

385
00:44:09,173 --> 00:44:12,836
Suraj and Sonia can be engaged
soon as he returns from London.

386
00:44:13,677 --> 00:44:19,912
Saxena, enough of sweet talk.
Let's talk something bitter now.

387
00:44:20,918 --> 00:44:24,445
So that the poison of bitterness
doesn't spread in our friendship.

388
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:29,581
I have still have not got
the payment for my goods.

389
00:44:30,527 --> 00:44:35,624
The party I have given the
goods to is delaying the payment.

390
00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:39,267
Since he is dangerous want to...

391
00:44:39,603 --> 00:44:43,164
When it comes to money,
I am very amoral.

392
00:44:44,575 --> 00:44:46,133
Let alone friends and foes.

393
00:44:47,111 --> 00:44:49,375
I don't hesitate to
kill my own people.

394
00:44:51,248 --> 00:44:57,551
My payment should reach within a week.

395
00:45:01,258 --> 00:45:02,088
Why did you stop the car?

396
00:45:02,693 --> 00:45:03,455
Look in front.

397
00:45:07,064 --> 00:45:07,655
Move aside.

398
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:18,641
Looking at her eyes I feel...

399
00:45:19,543 --> 00:45:22,478
The Goddess Kali resides in her!

400
00:45:23,147 --> 00:45:29,916
If she confidently says her sons
are coming, they must be en route...

401
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,749
- Accountant!
- I am...

402
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:36,487
Brother-in-law, finish the
story of this old hag today!

403
00:45:37,461 --> 00:45:41,488
Brother-in-law her words
pierce like a needle!

404
00:45:43,267 --> 00:45:44,097
Crush her.

405
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:49,665
What are you saying?
She is already dead.

406
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,537
Warriors do not assault women!

407
00:45:54,278 --> 00:45:56,838
- I say crush the old hag!
- No.

408
00:45:58,148 --> 00:45:59,342
No! What are you doing?

409
00:46:18,669 --> 00:46:19,727
Why do you get involved with them?

410
00:46:20,304 --> 00:46:23,705
They terrorize the whole village.
Why do you want to kill yourself?

411
00:46:24,308 --> 00:46:28,108
If I had to die,
I would have died long ago.

412
00:46:29,379 --> 00:46:32,940
But death can't destroy me
till I have destroyed them.

413
00:46:34,151 --> 00:46:36,051
My sons will come to destroy them.

414
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:39,189
The weapons of a mother.

415
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,915
Karan and Arjun will come.

416
00:46:43,827 --> 00:46:44,555
Mother!

417
00:46:47,798 --> 00:46:49,197
Mother.

418
00:47:28,472 --> 00:47:31,771
Run! Arjun run!

419
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:40,514
What's going on?
People suffer from sleep walking.

420
00:47:41,385 --> 00:47:42,875
Do you talk in your sleep?

421
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:49,384
Can you see me? My heart is
beating like a neck slit chicken!

422
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:55,363
These bones are knocking about
like the coins of a carom board!

423
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,062
Whom do you talk to in your sleep?

424
00:48:00,604 --> 00:48:01,696
I don't know.

425
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:06,035
But I could see strange shadows
right from my childhood.

426
00:48:06,977 --> 00:48:10,743
I feel as if I have
some relation to them.

427
00:48:13,216 --> 00:48:14,740
I have some deep bond with them.

428
00:48:17,421 --> 00:48:20,788
Something drags me to itself.

429
00:48:21,925 --> 00:48:22,983
Calls out to me.

430
00:48:24,227 --> 00:48:27,628
And what happened today...

431
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,565
...has never happened before.

432
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:33,461
What happened?

433
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,998
There is a village.

434
00:48:39,543 --> 00:48:40,874
Bells in a temple.

435
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:43,705
A path...

436
00:48:45,682 --> 00:48:47,309
And I saw myself.

437
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:52,818
I am running and somebody screams...

438
00:48:54,157 --> 00:48:55,522
Run Arjun run!

439
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:04,433
Ajay, your father vomited blood.

440
00:49:04,968 --> 00:49:06,492
The doctor said, he is very serious.

441
00:49:09,272 --> 00:49:12,241
Liquor has destroyed his liver.
We will have to operate him.

442
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,875
- How much money will be needed?
- 10,000.

443
00:49:18,015 --> 00:49:20,643
Fine, you operate him.

444
00:49:26,323 --> 00:49:29,724
- What? You'll lose this fight?
- Yes.

445
00:49:31,228 --> 00:49:32,855
Because today I have
to win against death.

446
00:49:34,197 --> 00:49:35,596
It's a matter of my Dad's life.

447
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,362
I need 10000 bucks.

448
00:49:39,202 --> 00:49:40,965
Another shower of cash!

449
00:49:41,371 --> 00:49:42,736
Cash? How partner?

450
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:46,299
He is the favorite.
People will bet for him.

451
00:49:46,843 --> 00:49:49,004
But we'll win because he'll lose.

452
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:51,444
And we won't have to pay anyone!

453
00:49:53,884 --> 00:49:56,250
But will you really lose?

454
00:49:58,555 --> 00:49:59,351
10000.

455
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:07,327
Is there anyone else?

456
00:50:08,265 --> 00:50:11,723
There is! The local
favorite, Ajay.

457
00:50:59,816 --> 00:51:01,681
Isn't the one who got thrashed
the same whose picture you showed me?

458
00:51:02,352 --> 00:51:05,219
But I don't understand
how the tide has turned.

459
00:52:09,152 --> 00:52:11,086
What are you doing?
We will be ruined!

460
00:52:28,805 --> 00:52:30,636
What are you doing?

461
00:52:45,488 --> 00:52:47,820
Stop it. What are you doing?

462
00:52:48,992 --> 00:52:51,085
You needed 10000 bucks!

463
00:52:51,695 --> 00:52:55,722
You said you'd lose the fight!
But you've ruined us by winning it!

464
00:52:56,466 --> 00:52:57,228
What's wrong with you?

465
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:01,228
I wanted to lose the fight.

466
00:53:03,106 --> 00:53:07,202
I don't know what happened to me.

467
00:53:20,857 --> 00:53:23,690
A life time remains
for you to know who I am.

468
00:53:24,961 --> 00:53:28,397
But at this moment your father
only has a couple of moments.

469
00:53:29,266 --> 00:53:31,791
And this is my card.

470
00:53:57,894 --> 00:53:59,361
- Who are you?
- My name is Ajay.

471
00:54:00,063 --> 00:54:02,224
- Is Mr. Saxena at home?
- Yes, sit. I'll call him.

472
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,651
- Who is it?
- My name is Ajay.

473
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:32,356
But there is no one named,
Ajay in Mr. Saxena's home.

474
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:34,997
I'm a guest.

475
00:54:35,498 --> 00:54:37,966
Gentleman, all of us are
guests in this world.

476
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:42,530
Nevertheless, my telephone
line got linked with yours.

477
00:54:44,774 --> 00:54:48,107
In the course of talking,
our hearts too may be linked.

478
00:54:48,945 --> 00:54:50,242
And we could become friends.

479
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,007
So, are we friends?

480
00:54:53,783 --> 00:54:54,807
I am not interested.

481
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:00,950
Sir, you appear a strict man.

482
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:05,884
I have just lit my
father's funeral pyre.

483
00:55:07,163 --> 00:55:10,655
Please call Sonia.
I am Vijay speaking.

484
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,497
Tell him that Sonia has left.

485
00:55:15,939 --> 00:55:16,803
She has left.

486
00:55:19,075 --> 00:55:22,238
Sonia dear, hurry up!

487
00:55:23,046 --> 00:55:25,037
We have to go to the
airport to receive Suraj.

488
00:55:25,648 --> 00:55:27,639
- She just left.
- You?

489
00:55:29,853 --> 00:55:31,013
How is your father?

490
00:55:31,755 --> 00:55:38,251
Here are your 8000 bucks.
I spent 2000 to cremate him.

491
00:55:39,095 --> 00:55:40,153
I'll pay back soon.

492
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,461
I like your sense of self respect.

493
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:53,273
Will you work for me?

494
00:55:53,910 --> 00:56:00,577
Your strength, your obsession,
the fire smoldering in your eyes.

495
00:56:01,384 --> 00:56:03,147
I like them. Will you work?

496
00:56:03,987 --> 00:56:08,151
I would have refused another
but I am indebted to you.

497
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:12,359
- I'll begin tomorrow.
- Not tomorrow, right now.

498
00:56:13,696 --> 00:56:14,856
We have to go to the airport.

499
00:56:26,976 --> 00:56:28,170
- How was the trip?
- Fantastic.

500
00:56:28,812 --> 00:56:32,714
- Where's Sonia?
- She's anxiously waiting at home.

501
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:36,978
My white Mercedes is outside.

502
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,546
You go ahead. I'll clear
the customs and come.

503
00:56:53,169 --> 00:56:54,101
Is this Mr. Saxena's car?

504
00:56:55,605 --> 00:56:56,469
Keep this briefcase in the car.

505
00:57:00,176 --> 00:57:02,337
Didn't you hear what I said?
Keep this briefcase in the car!

506
00:57:04,347 --> 00:57:05,678
I am not your father's servant!

507
00:57:06,449 --> 00:57:10,442
You dare take the name of Suraj
Singh's father, Durjan Singh?

508
00:57:16,426 --> 00:57:18,326
Keep your right hand in your pocket.

509
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:22,429
Or you will have to eat
with your left hand forever.

510
00:57:25,735 --> 00:57:27,168
I think both of you have
introduced yourselves.

511
00:57:28,304 --> 00:57:29,737
He is Ajay, a superb fighter.

512
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,068
And he is Suraj Singh,
Sonia's fiancee.

513
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:29,457
Since I came here
that's all I hear.

514
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:32,233
Sonia is on her way.
She'll soon be here.

515
01:03:32,735 --> 01:03:35,795
It's turned to evening from morning
and there's no sign of Sonia...

516
01:03:38,174 --> 01:03:40,005
Here comes Sonia!

517
01:03:43,012 --> 01:03:47,847
And you neither came to
the airport nor were you at home!

518
01:03:48,351 --> 01:03:50,478
I want to tell you so much!
And listen to so much!

519
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,252
Will you first listen to me
or tell me about yourself?

520
01:03:54,557 --> 01:03:57,151
Now what do I listen to you
and what do I tell you?

521
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,753
- Why? - If you listen to
me, you will forget yourself.

522
01:04:00,196 --> 01:04:01,754
And if you'll forget yourself
what will you remember about me?

523
01:04:02,265 --> 01:04:04,096
And if you won't remember,
what's the use in telling you?

524
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:05,999
And what's the point in doing
something that's of no use?

525
01:04:06,669 --> 01:04:07,658
Am I right? Bye.

526
01:04:13,175 --> 01:04:15,575
What did she say?
Uncle did you understand?

527
01:04:16,612 --> 01:04:18,944
Son, I'm not so stupid.

528
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:33,755
Did you see? This gun can tear
apart a 3 inch steel sheet.

529
01:04:34,497 --> 01:04:36,328
It can shatter a bullet
proof glass into pieces.

530
01:04:37,066 --> 01:04:38,966
Like, people select pearls
in the deep waters...

531
01:04:39,468 --> 01:04:41,936
...I too have selected
this deadly gun from abroad.

532
01:04:42,338 --> 01:04:51,212
A month later, these guns will
be delivered at the borders.

533
01:04:52,248 --> 01:04:56,878
As usual, these guns will
reach me through Durjan Singh.

534
01:04:57,553 --> 01:04:58,713
And I will give them to you.

535
01:04:59,488 --> 01:05:02,855
Place your order for
any number of guns.

536
01:05:03,926 --> 01:05:08,363
Uncle think, one of our
customers have not come.

537
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,797
- Has he rebelled?
- No.

538
01:05:14,003 --> 01:05:15,436
No. He has become dishonest.

539
01:05:16,439 --> 01:05:20,466
He did not pay me for
the goods bought last time.

540
01:05:22,044 --> 01:05:27,107
And whenever I sent any of my
men to collect the money...

541
01:05:27,516 --> 01:05:29,211
They did not return alive.

542
01:05:30,052 --> 01:05:31,451
That means he swallowed our money?

543
01:05:33,289 --> 01:05:35,587
Such a man is not born!

544
01:05:38,027 --> 01:05:43,260
I have created a man of
steel to get even with him.

545
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:10,858
Peter, talk to your
men over the telephone.

546
01:06:12,328 --> 01:06:15,957
Ask them to make my payment.

547
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:18,691
Or to take away your corpse!

548
01:06:24,607 --> 01:06:28,202
What is the matter? You are
trying to look very dashing today.

549
01:06:34,784 --> 01:06:37,344
Take this. All my debts are cleared.

550
01:06:37,887 --> 01:06:38,751
All right, Sir.

551
01:06:40,489 --> 01:06:42,923
You are repaying everybody's debts.

552
01:06:43,325 --> 01:06:45,657
- When will you repay mine?
- What have I taken from you?

553
01:06:46,529 --> 01:06:51,091
You have taken, what nobody
could ever take from me.

554
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:53,165
You didn't understand?

555
01:06:53,936 --> 01:06:56,370
You have taken this girl's heart.

556
01:06:57,306 --> 01:06:58,671
What? You, a girl?

557
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:04,477
Look in the mirror. You don't
look like a girl from any angle.

558
01:07:05,548 --> 01:07:08,210
Am I not...

559
01:13:11,947 --> 01:13:12,914
What's the matter?

560
01:13:14,216 --> 01:13:16,912
Nothing. It felt...

561
01:13:19,087 --> 01:13:21,317
I felt as if these bangles...

562
01:13:55,257 --> 01:14:00,217
I can only buy you glass bangles.

563
01:14:01,763 --> 01:14:02,855
Not golden ones.

564
01:14:03,765 --> 01:14:06,165
What's wrong with you today?

565
01:14:06,835 --> 01:14:09,030
- What are you saying?
- Yes.

566
01:14:10,539 --> 01:14:12,837
I did fall in love with you.

567
01:14:14,309 --> 01:14:18,268
But I never thought that
you are a princess.

568
01:14:18,981 --> 01:14:20,346
And I'm the dust of the roads.

569
01:14:22,784 --> 01:14:26,618
- Will I be able to give you all...
- You mean wealth is everything?

570
01:14:27,456 --> 01:14:31,483
No. Money helps man
buy expensive things.

571
01:14:32,127 --> 01:14:33,685
But not a heart.

572
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:37,355
Man can buy food with money.

573
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:39,556
But not hunger.

574
01:14:40,869 --> 01:14:44,828
Man can buy a body with
money but not true love!

575
01:14:46,341 --> 01:14:48,605
Love is the greatest
wealth of this universe.

576
01:14:49,278 --> 01:14:51,610
Which you and I have got.

577
01:14:52,314 --> 01:14:55,477
Your love and affection.

578
01:15:00,656 --> 01:15:02,385
They are the treasures of my life.

579
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,457
I'll never let them be away from me.

580
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:23,002
I want to see you in palaces.

581
01:15:23,612 --> 01:15:29,278
And you've decided to make a
horse grooms your life partner!

582
01:15:30,018 --> 01:15:35,012
Not just make him my life partner
but promised to live and die together!

583
01:15:35,657 --> 01:15:39,991
Your anger and cruelty
cannot change our minds.

584
01:15:40,896 --> 01:15:42,523
I'll change his life!

585
01:15:43,966 --> 01:15:46,400
I'll destroy him!
I can do anything!

586
01:15:48,537 --> 01:15:51,506
Can you carry your daughter's
pyre on your shoulders?

587
01:15:52,574 --> 01:15:58,069
You are blind in his love.
I'll show you when the time comes!

588
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:01,681
I'll shoot you if you
come out of the room tonight!

589
01:16:13,128 --> 01:16:18,430
You lead a peaceful life.
You are very fortunate.

590
01:16:19,234 --> 01:16:21,566
You have no tension about food.

591
01:16:22,537 --> 01:16:25,938
I massage you; I serve you.

592
01:16:26,575 --> 01:16:29,009
Who serves me? Nobody.

593
01:16:30,178 --> 01:16:32,942
In the next life,
I will be born as a horse...

594
01:16:33,649 --> 01:16:35,412
...and you as Lingayya.

595
01:16:38,286 --> 01:16:39,753
Why are you laughing?

596
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:42,323
Hey! Why are you talking to horses?

597
01:16:42,691 --> 01:16:44,784
Do you have time to talk to me?

598
01:16:45,427 --> 01:16:47,554
You are busy diving in the
swimming pool of love!

599
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:51,927
The sea of love is very deep.
If you drown...

600
01:16:52,868 --> 01:16:55,632
Hey! Drowning is what
they call love, right?

601
01:16:56,505 --> 01:17:03,434
You have really become a
lovesick Romeo in a week.

602
01:17:05,847 --> 01:17:08,475
The thrill isn't the same
when you stake you're life riding...

603
01:17:09,551 --> 01:17:12,019
...as is the thrill when you
stake your heart in love.

604
01:17:15,991 --> 01:17:20,928
If you do not listen to me,
then your life will be at stake.

605
01:17:21,997 --> 01:17:24,522
For I have brought your
death in my hand!

606
01:17:27,235 --> 01:17:29,760
A tiger's death in a mosquito's hand?

607
01:17:30,839 --> 01:17:34,172
Who is this impediment
in the path of love?

608
01:17:37,045 --> 01:17:39,104
I am Durjan Singh's son
and Sonia's fiancee.

609
01:17:40,148 --> 01:17:41,615
My name is Suraj Singh.

610
01:19:31,259 --> 01:19:32,089
Sir!

611
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,418
Burn the place!

612
01:20:03,725 --> 01:20:07,058
Take him away and go! Hurry!

613
01:20:38,526 --> 01:20:41,984
Love got burnt!
Lover got burnt!

614
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:44,866
Very good, son!

615
01:20:45,634 --> 01:20:48,899
To remove obstacles on the
way and to destroy enemies...

616
01:20:49,537 --> 01:20:51,266
...is this family's tradition.

617
01:20:52,207 --> 01:20:54,505
So I have abided by the
family's tradition.

618
01:20:55,944 --> 01:21:01,382
Fool! Jokes apart. Prepare
for your engagement to Sonia.

619
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:03,815
We are coming there.

620
01:21:17,465 --> 01:21:21,697
Today is the happiest
day of my life.

621
01:21:22,637 --> 01:21:26,630
Because today I announce
the engagement of my only...

622
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:32,074
...daughter, Sonia to
Durjan Singh's son Suraj.

623
01:21:35,183 --> 01:21:38,516
Soon as he arrives,
the custom of engagement will...

624
01:21:40,488 --> 01:21:41,648
There he comes.

625
01:21:48,396 --> 01:21:49,055
Stop!

626
01:21:59,474 --> 01:22:00,998
You burnt my Dad's stable!

627
01:22:01,776 --> 01:22:03,266
I'll burn your fingers!

628
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,372
- Call the police.
- No!

629
01:22:08,583 --> 01:22:10,710
Let go of me!

630
01:24:32,293 --> 01:24:34,887
Run! Arjun run!

631
01:24:35,263 --> 01:24:36,992
Run! Arjun run!

632
01:24:37,332 --> 01:24:39,562
I tell you to run!

633
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:04,856
Arrest him!

634
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:27,473
We are Thakurs by birth.

635
01:25:28,516 --> 01:25:33,351
Pride and anger courses through
our veins along with blood.

636
01:25:34,455 --> 01:25:40,257
Whenever our women step in
the quicksand of disrepute...

637
01:25:41,696 --> 01:25:45,962
We have them buried alive
in the walls of our homes!

638
01:25:47,535 --> 01:25:50,197
But the love of my son holds me back.

639
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:54,602
I have always fulfilled
every dream of my son.

640
01:25:56,144 --> 01:25:58,738
And today I will fulfill this dream.

641
01:26:00,048 --> 01:26:02,744
You will marry my son in my house!

642
01:26:04,152 --> 01:26:07,952
Prepare to leave.

643
01:26:09,691 --> 01:26:12,216
I don't understand anything.

644
01:26:13,561 --> 01:26:17,520
All of a sudden why did
our hands stop fighting?

645
01:26:19,067 --> 01:26:20,364
And then why did he tell me this?

646
01:26:20,902 --> 01:26:25,839
Run Arjun! And why did I obey him?

647
01:26:26,641 --> 01:26:29,269
What did he say?
Repeat it again.

648
01:26:30,812 --> 01:26:32,006
Run Arjun! Run!

649
01:26:33,548 --> 01:26:34,810
Something is terribly wrong!

650
01:26:35,383 --> 01:26:37,578
This is the same phrase
you uttered in your sleep!

651
01:26:38,086 --> 01:26:40,850
That's what I am thinking.

652
01:26:43,191 --> 01:26:45,091
The words I kept saying in my sleep...

653
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:51,296
I kept murmuring.

654
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,765
The same words. The same name.

655
01:26:54,102 --> 01:26:55,626
How did they come on my lips?

656
01:26:56,471 --> 01:26:58,564
Who is this Arjun?

657
01:27:22,864 --> 01:27:23,990
Who are you?

658
01:27:24,299 --> 01:27:25,493
That's what I want to ask you.

659
01:27:26,901 --> 01:27:32,032
- Why does it feel as if...
- We know each other?

660
01:27:34,108 --> 01:27:35,939
We have some deep bond.

661
01:27:37,812 --> 01:27:40,645
There's a chord that
draws us close to each other.

662
01:27:42,717 --> 01:27:44,480
We have met before.

663
01:27:46,154 --> 01:27:49,487
No. I don't even know your name.

664
01:27:50,525 --> 01:27:53,790
Then in the party why did you say?

665
01:27:54,762 --> 01:27:56,059
Run Arjun! Run!

666
01:27:56,831 --> 01:28:00,096
I too am worried. I can't understand.

667
01:28:01,436 --> 01:28:03,427
How did these words come to my lips?

668
01:28:04,138 --> 01:28:07,005
Who forced me to say it?

669
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:10,537
I don't know any Arjun.

670
01:28:12,447 --> 01:28:13,880
Neither do I.

671
01:28:15,883 --> 01:28:19,046
But it feels as if we have some
strange relation to this name.

672
01:28:21,155 --> 01:28:22,520
Some old association.

673
01:28:25,126 --> 01:28:32,726
Anyway my name is Vijay.
Thanks for saving my life.

674
01:28:34,736 --> 01:28:37,432
God forbid but if you
ever face such a situation...

675
01:28:38,706 --> 01:28:42,005
I will repay this debt.

676
01:29:02,797 --> 01:29:07,598
Letter from Sonia for you!

677
01:29:09,303 --> 01:29:10,463
Something appears fishy!

678
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:14,702
Her servant gave it.

679
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,310
What is it son?

680
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:25,776
They are forcibly taking my
Sonia to Durjan Singh's mansion.

681
01:29:27,755 --> 01:29:30,189
She has asked me to rescue her.

682
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,451
She writes if I don't reach there...

683
01:29:36,998 --> 01:29:39,967
She will consume potion and kill
herself but won't marry Suraj.

684
01:29:40,468 --> 01:29:43,767
What are you thinking of?
Prepare to leave.

685
01:29:45,406 --> 01:29:48,864
If I go, what happens to your stable?

686
01:29:50,344 --> 01:29:52,312
- Your business?
- Business goes on.

687
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:56,015
But once lost how will life return?

688
01:29:56,751 --> 01:29:59,242
She is your love. Go my son.

689
01:30:00,054 --> 01:30:01,419
God be with you.

690
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:09,062
That rascal has given you
these bangles, right?

691
01:30:10,264 --> 01:30:11,561
Throw them away.

692
01:30:14,702 --> 01:30:16,966
- Throw them away, dear.
- No! This is my Vijay's memento.

693
01:30:17,338 --> 01:30:20,330
Not a memento!
This is a forgotten story now!

694
01:30:22,076 --> 01:30:25,603
- No!
- Remove them, dear.

695
01:31:23,237 --> 01:31:27,003
Funny station.
Can't see a single human being.

696
01:31:29,410 --> 01:31:30,434
We'll ask him.

697
01:31:35,516 --> 01:31:37,677
How far is Durjan Singh's mansion?

698
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:47,318
What is he staring at?

699
01:31:49,564 --> 01:31:51,361
Uncle, where are you?

700
01:31:53,267 --> 01:31:54,495
This can't be true!

701
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:01,771
I hope the mansion is not haunted.

702
01:32:02,476 --> 01:32:06,276
The old man ran away hearing the
name! Something is very fishy!

703
01:32:09,317 --> 01:32:11,012
- Come on.
- Come.

704
01:32:14,021 --> 01:32:19,789
You have fallen in love but
the game of love is very dangerous.

705
01:32:20,394 --> 01:32:25,354
Unless you play with danger
you don't relish life with love.

706
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:28,063
Life is not a delicacy to relish!

707
01:32:53,194 --> 01:32:56,357
What a village you've brought me to!

708
01:33:01,469 --> 01:33:02,993
I don't see one single man here!

709
01:33:47,014 --> 01:33:49,278
What are you looking in the pond for?

710
01:33:50,217 --> 01:33:51,411
Do you want to go fishing?

711
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:58,850
I feel I have seen this place before.

712
01:34:01,195 --> 01:34:02,685
What are you saying?

713
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:05,895
I know you since your childhood.
You were born amongst horses.

714
01:34:07,902 --> 01:34:09,460
I find something fishy here!

715
01:34:12,173 --> 01:34:16,109
No. I have worked here.

716
01:34:18,312 --> 01:34:20,507
Huge boulders used to be lifted here.

717
01:34:24,452 --> 01:34:27,944
People say many years ago
boulders were lifted by camels.

718
01:34:35,029 --> 01:34:39,557
Around here somewhere,
there is a bangle market?

719
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,865
There is a big market.

720
01:35:02,857 --> 01:35:04,825
Have you come from within the
earth or jumped from the heavens?

721
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:08,658
Forget that and tell us
the price of the bangles.

722
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:11,598
All of a sudden, bangles?

723
01:35:13,434 --> 01:35:14,059
Show me these.

724
01:35:15,503 --> 01:35:16,299
Yes these colorful ones.

725
01:35:50,471 --> 01:35:51,403
What did you say?

726
01:35:52,306 --> 01:35:56,902
I can't believe it! You are Arjun.

727
01:35:58,813 --> 01:36:02,305
- Who is that?
- The light of the eyes of that woman.

728
01:36:04,351 --> 01:36:05,841
That was extinguished by evil men.

729
01:36:07,688 --> 01:36:08,985
His name was Arjun.

730
01:36:10,157 --> 01:36:14,184
I have heard this name many times.

731
01:36:22,403 --> 01:36:27,136
I have seen this temple in my dreams.

732
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:32,804
I can't understand anything.

733
01:36:34,114 --> 01:36:36,446
What is all this?

734
01:36:40,387 --> 01:36:43,254
Mother! This means...

735
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:46,917
You have performed this miracle!

736
01:36:49,597 --> 01:36:53,693
The impossible was
born as the possible!

737
01:36:56,904 --> 01:36:58,132
You are Arjun.

738
01:36:59,773 --> 01:37:01,866
The boon of Goddess Kali.

739
01:37:03,377 --> 01:37:05,641
The boon asked for at this place.

740
01:37:08,816 --> 01:37:11,478
- By the mother.
- Which mother?

741
01:37:12,786 --> 01:37:14,811
- Whose mother?
- Your mother.

742
01:37:17,491 --> 01:37:18,685
My mother?

743
01:37:34,708 --> 01:37:35,868
My Arjun has come!

744
01:37:36,744 --> 01:37:38,974
Arjun has come! My son has come!

745
01:38:40,641 --> 01:38:41,539
Mother!

746
01:38:50,985 --> 01:38:53,818
Where had you gone, leaving me alone?

747
01:38:55,589 --> 01:38:57,523
Where had you gone my son?

748
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:06,265
I have shed a lot of
tears in your sorrow.

749
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:11,868
There is no place or path
in this village...

750
01:39:14,408 --> 01:39:16,399
...Where I didn't look for you.

751
01:39:18,078 --> 01:39:20,603
Had you gone very far?

752
01:39:22,416 --> 01:39:25,112
...That it took so long to return?

753
01:39:26,453 --> 01:39:28,387
Speak up my son.

754
01:39:30,324 --> 01:39:31,814
I have grown old.

755
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,689
My eyes have grown weak.

756
01:39:36,096 --> 01:39:39,088
But my heart didn't grow weak.

757
01:39:40,667 --> 01:39:44,125
I was sure you would come.

758
01:39:45,639 --> 01:39:48,472
You will definitely come to
repay the debt of maternal love.

759
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:52,039
The Goddess Mother heard my prayers.

760
01:39:53,147 --> 01:39:55,707
And you have come!

761
01:40:17,371 --> 01:40:18,235
My son!

762
01:40:19,506 --> 01:40:22,498
No, my son. Don't cry.

763
01:40:23,544 --> 01:40:27,036
I've cried enough for all of us.

764
01:40:27,948 --> 01:40:29,279
You don't cry.

765
01:40:43,697 --> 01:40:45,096
You didn't bring Karan?

766
01:40:48,035 --> 01:40:49,093
When will he come?

767
01:40:58,045 --> 01:41:02,311
If Arjun has come,
Karan too will come mother.

768
01:41:12,693 --> 01:41:15,662
Don't cry. I've only
been sentenced for 6 months.

769
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:21,633
When I get out of jail, I'll sort
out each member of Saxena's family!

770
01:41:32,513 --> 01:41:33,537
Where have they taken him?

771
01:42:07,447 --> 01:42:09,506
The other day you asked who I was.

772
01:42:17,457 --> 01:42:22,053
Today I bring not only mine
but also your introduction.

773
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:36,140
You are Karan. And I'm Arjun.

774
01:42:38,011 --> 01:42:39,569
We have been reborn.

775
01:42:53,727 --> 01:42:56,287
And our mother is still
waiting for us to return.

776
01:42:58,432 --> 01:43:01,993
The sun gets tired and sets.

777
01:43:02,536 --> 01:43:04,265
But the mother's eyes keep
looking out for her sons.

778
01:43:06,907 --> 01:43:08,169
She keeps awake.

779
01:44:46,206 --> 01:44:48,640
Why has a crowd gathered?

780
01:44:49,543 --> 01:44:51,511
Has somebody fallen off his horse?

781
01:44:52,946 --> 01:44:53,970
Let me see.

782
01:45:07,761 --> 01:45:09,353
Finished! The Thakur has had it!

783
01:45:09,896 --> 01:45:11,955
He is finished!

784
01:45:25,612 --> 01:45:30,345
Whom shall I give this
good news to? Got it!

785
01:45:35,355 --> 01:45:40,088
We taste liquor daily. Shall we
taste some village belle?

786
01:45:41,828 --> 01:45:44,160
Yes, Nahar. It has been weeks.

787
01:45:45,298 --> 01:45:49,325
We have neither hunted
animals nor women.

788
01:45:49,936 --> 01:45:52,666
The hunting will
start now, gentlemen.

789
01:45:53,507 --> 01:45:57,443
You are heading towards a
cemetery, wearing slippers!

790
01:45:58,044 --> 01:45:58,772
And I am just watching!

791
01:45:59,012 --> 01:46:00,240
Hey! What are you barking?

792
01:46:00,714 --> 01:46:05,981
I bark. I am a dog.
But you are goats.

793
01:46:06,887 --> 01:46:10,618
You will be slaughtered.
The landlord is damned!

794
01:46:10,924 --> 01:46:11,618
What is it?

795
01:46:11,925 --> 01:46:15,725
The drama will take place.

796
01:46:16,329 --> 01:46:19,162
Both of them have returned.
The landlord is damned!

797
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:21,232
- Who?
- The same.

798
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:26,130
- Karan and Arjun.
- Who are they?

799
01:46:27,441 --> 01:46:29,238
The ones who were killed
by us years ago?

800
01:46:29,976 --> 01:46:32,877
- The same Karan and Arjun?
- Yes!

801
01:46:33,647 --> 01:46:38,584
- Corpses don't come alive.
- They have.

802
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:40,586
A miracle has happened.

803
01:46:40,987 --> 01:46:44,650
I would advice you to pack
up and go on a pilgrimage.

804
01:46:45,025 --> 01:46:50,224
My heart beats fast!
The landlord is damned!

805
01:46:53,099 --> 01:46:57,729
- I wonder if he is...
- Yes, Nahar.

806
01:46:58,271 --> 01:47:02,264
If there is truth in what he says...

807
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:04,567
Then we have to get to its roots.

808
01:47:05,445 --> 01:47:10,109
Let's see, how the old lady's
broken stick got joined again.

809
01:47:11,017 --> 01:47:12,416
Who are Karan and Arjun?

810
01:47:13,386 --> 01:47:18,346
Look at these boulders.
We used to work here.

811
01:47:26,066 --> 01:47:28,933
What's the matter?
Why are you quiet?

812
01:47:31,271 --> 01:47:34,707
You were quiet when you met mother
even in front of the villagers.

813
01:47:36,209 --> 01:47:37,233
And you're still quiet.

814
01:47:40,013 --> 01:47:44,575
- This can't be true.
- Can't be true? What?

815
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,918
I don't believe in
this story of rebirth.

816
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,516
It's all trash.

817
01:47:52,993 --> 01:47:58,795
Trash? All these villagers
look at you and say Karan!

818
01:47:59,833 --> 01:48:00,857
Is that trash?

819
01:48:02,135 --> 01:48:05,127
A mother's heart held you close
and called you her son.

820
01:48:05,872 --> 01:48:06,896
Is that trash?

821
01:48:08,341 --> 01:48:10,241
Couldn't you see the love
behind the mother's tears?

822
01:48:11,278 --> 01:48:14,145
Is that mother lying?
Is her love treachery?

823
01:48:14,981 --> 01:48:16,608
Is her wait for years a pretense?

824
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:21,649
But it's possible that
I'm born with her son's looks.

825
01:48:22,355 --> 01:48:25,085
If that is true why did your
hands stop beating me at the party?

826
01:48:25,792 --> 01:48:27,384
Why did you say, 'Run Arjun! Run! '?

827
01:48:29,296 --> 01:48:31,287
Because my name was
Arjun in my last birth.

828
01:48:31,698 --> 01:48:32,562
And you were Karan.

829
01:48:33,733 --> 01:48:35,030
We were her sons.

830
01:48:36,937 --> 01:48:40,168
And terrible injustice
has been done to her!

831
01:48:41,374 --> 01:48:42,602
We were both killed.

832
01:48:43,209 --> 01:48:45,268
And we have been reborn.

833
01:48:47,213 --> 01:48:50,148
Don't you recall anything even now?

834
01:48:50,917 --> 01:48:53,681
No I don't recall anything.

835
01:48:54,721 --> 01:49:00,717
Brother! Shamsher and Nahar
Singh are troubling your mother!

836
01:49:11,738 --> 01:49:14,366
I heard that God has sent you the
support which you need for old age?

837
01:49:15,342 --> 01:49:16,366
Where are they?

838
01:49:17,777 --> 01:49:20,211
Where are your children? Answer!

839
01:49:22,882 --> 01:49:26,511
Answer, old woman!
Where are your Karan and Arjun?

840
01:49:28,655 --> 01:49:29,417
Answer!

841
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:35,818
Old woman! Will you answer or not?

842
01:49:49,209 --> 01:49:57,173
The son of this helpless mother
has come to wipe her tears!

843
01:49:58,151 --> 01:49:58,845
Son?

844
01:50:03,390 --> 01:50:05,187
The same son that we killed years ago?

845
01:50:08,995 --> 01:50:11,293
He is a look-alike of
this old hag's son.

846
01:50:12,465 --> 01:50:14,990
I think he's a cheat from the city.

847
01:50:16,836 --> 01:50:19,669
You probably didn't hear the
story of the death of her sons.

848
01:50:21,641 --> 01:50:26,874
If you had heard, you wouldn't
dare to step in this village!

849
01:50:29,149 --> 01:50:31,879
But now that he is here,
let us finish him too!

850
01:52:13,253 --> 01:52:14,379
I'm coming!

851
01:52:18,258 --> 01:52:22,752
Hit them son! Let them know
my sons have returned!

852
01:59:45,871 --> 01:59:48,533
Fools! You have become
crazy in a state of inebriety.

853
01:59:50,009 --> 01:59:51,840
You have gone into
a world of illusions!

854
01:59:52,979 --> 01:59:55,174
You say, that Karan
and Arjun thrashed you!

855
01:59:56,015 --> 01:59:58,142
The same Karan and Arjun
who have gone to hell?

856
01:59:59,085 --> 02:00:00,950
Our eyes cannot deceive us.

857
02:00:01,354 --> 02:00:05,916
We saw their faces!
How can we forget their faces?

858
02:00:06,492 --> 02:00:10,553
Yes. You can't forget, when
someone thrashes you so badly!

859
02:00:11,564 --> 02:00:15,295
Whom are you discussing?
Who are Karan and Arjun?

860
02:00:16,002 --> 02:00:20,701
The ones whom I had
killed years ago, Saxena.

861
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:24,407
They say that they
have returned alive.

862
02:00:25,211 --> 02:00:26,735
...and hit them!

863
02:00:29,715 --> 02:00:31,876
How can it be? Lmpossible!

864
02:00:32,551 --> 02:00:34,280
That's what I'm saying.

865
02:00:35,087 --> 02:00:40,650
You always rebuke my brothers.
You don't believe them at all.

866
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:43,560
- Shut up!
- Ask him if you disbelieve us.

867
02:00:44,030 --> 02:00:45,827
Why ask me?

868
02:00:46,465 --> 02:00:52,961
If he does not believe you,
then how will he believe me?

869
02:00:53,439 --> 02:00:54,804
All right. Ask the villagers.

870
02:00:55,241 --> 02:00:56,640
Villagers, I ask you who they are.

871
02:00:59,378 --> 02:01:02,074
Where are they?

872
02:01:03,549 --> 02:01:09,454
Who dares to oppose me
and awaits his death?

873
02:01:10,456 --> 02:01:11,650
Whom are you talking of, Sir?

874
02:01:13,259 --> 02:01:18,492
They do not know! I am talking
of those two who hit my uncles.

875
02:01:19,131 --> 02:01:22,362
Who would dare to even
lift a finger at them?

876
02:01:22,868 --> 02:01:23,800
Hey, old man!

877
02:01:24,370 --> 02:01:28,534
Why don't you say that Karan
and Arjun hit us like dogs?

878
02:01:29,075 --> 02:01:30,542
You make us liars
before brother-in-law?

879
02:01:32,144 --> 02:01:34,908
Why don't you say, old man,
that Karan and Arjun hit us?

880
02:01:35,581 --> 02:01:36,479
Where is the old woman, Durga?

881
02:01:39,051 --> 02:01:42,646
Durga is a mad woman;
she wanders across villages.

882
02:01:43,556 --> 02:01:45,990
We have not seen her in months.
Then where did you see her?

883
02:01:50,196 --> 02:01:55,896
May you die!
May a garland adorn your picture!

884
02:01:56,235 --> 02:02:00,137
May you lose your lives!
I have seen them myself.

885
02:02:00,439 --> 02:02:03,567
They had embraced
Durga near the hills.

886
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:09,207
Sir, Karan and Arjun
have come to this village.

887
02:02:09,882 --> 02:02:13,215
You are not aware. Today,
they pose a problem to everyone.

888
02:02:13,486 --> 02:02:16,478
Tomorrow, they may pose
a problem to you...

889
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:23,126
There they are!

890
02:02:30,202 --> 02:02:30,930
Nobody is there.

891
02:02:32,204 --> 02:02:34,172
Hey! Are you trying to frighten us?

892
02:02:38,277 --> 02:02:46,184
No, no... I saw them myself...
I saw Karan and Arjun.

893
02:02:46,485 --> 02:02:50,080
Ask your brothers-in-law
if you don't believe me.

894
02:02:50,389 --> 02:02:51,913
- Didn't you see them on top?
- No.

895
02:02:52,258 --> 02:02:53,156
- You saw?
- No!

896
02:02:53,459 --> 02:02:57,759
You will have me killed! You
sometimes agree and sometimes deny.

897
02:02:58,397 --> 02:02:59,557
You will have me slapped!

898
02:03:04,870 --> 02:03:06,428
Isn't this a brinjal?

899
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:09,669
Isn't this a carrot?

900
02:03:10,543 --> 02:03:12,306
Isn't this a radish?

901
02:03:13,579 --> 02:03:16,275
If I can call a carrot and
a radish by their names...

902
02:03:16,549 --> 02:03:19,575
Then how can I do otherwise,
for Karan and Arjun?

903
02:03:20,019 --> 02:03:22,214
They were indeed Karan and Arjun.

904
02:03:25,124 --> 02:03:28,855
Why are looking around? I said
they were Karan and Arjun.

905
02:03:31,464 --> 02:03:32,624
Who is talking?

906
02:03:33,332 --> 02:03:36,358
I am talking, rascal. I am!

907
02:03:37,770 --> 02:03:39,294
But why is the voice
coming from inside?

908
02:03:39,805 --> 02:03:43,241
Fool! The voice is coming, not
from inside, but from beneath you.

909
02:03:44,543 --> 02:03:48,274
From beneath me? My voice
comes from the top...

910
02:03:51,383 --> 02:03:55,410
I am dead! Where did
the earthquake come from?

911
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:57,346
From Latur!

912
02:04:01,026 --> 02:04:03,290
Who are you?
You frightened me.

913
02:04:03,796 --> 02:04:07,857
I'm the one who frightens and
unveils the truth. Your villager.

914
02:04:10,836 --> 02:04:14,397
But I have... never
seen you in the village.

915
02:04:15,174 --> 02:04:19,543
You call a brinjal, a carrot
and a carrot, a radish!

916
02:04:21,013 --> 02:04:23,743
Lmplying, there is some
mistake in my eyes?

917
02:04:24,283 --> 02:04:28,344
No. Your head says, you saw;
your eyes say otherwise.

918
02:04:29,255 --> 02:04:32,247
Yes. That's what is
happening with me.

919
02:04:32,758 --> 02:04:34,817
Listen to what your eyes say.

920
02:04:36,295 --> 02:04:39,492
Karan and Arjun are in
his village. I saw them!

921
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:44,067
I have to give an answer for
this slap to the landlord.

922
02:04:46,105 --> 02:04:49,973
Will you be able to say
this before the landlord?

923
02:04:50,609 --> 02:04:55,069
Let alone the landlord,
I can say before everybody!

924
02:04:56,148 --> 02:04:59,743
Irrespective of the dire consequences,
I won't shy from speaking the truth!

925
02:05:00,119 --> 02:05:02,314
I mean it, when I say,
that I have seen Karan and Arjun.

926
02:05:02,788 --> 02:05:04,255
- Then come with me!
- Where?

927
02:05:04,590 --> 02:05:07,718
Did you fix an auspicious time
for Suraj and Sonia's wedding?

928
02:05:08,761 --> 02:05:13,892
Yes. The auspicious time is
three days after 'Dassera'.

929
02:05:14,567 --> 02:05:18,663
I will create such a sensation...

930
02:05:19,405 --> 02:05:23,967
...That my son's marriage will
set an example... a history.

931
02:05:25,177 --> 02:05:26,974
- Bless me, Sir.
- You have come again?

932
02:05:27,813 --> 02:05:31,442
What did I get for my
honesty and veracity?

933
02:05:32,251 --> 02:05:33,878
Betel leaf. Eat it.

934
02:05:34,453 --> 02:05:39,447
Madam, he slapped me very hard
before the entire village.

935
02:05:40,092 --> 02:05:41,787
I have also got hardcore evidence.

936
02:05:42,795 --> 02:05:45,992
Not only me, even the villagers
have seen Karan and Arjun.

937
02:05:47,333 --> 02:05:49,460
- Who, the villagers?
- He...

938
02:05:49,768 --> 02:05:51,497
Blessings, landlord!

939
02:05:53,272 --> 02:05:55,900
Get up!
What did you see?

940
02:05:56,575 --> 02:05:59,510
See? What did I see?
Oh God!

941
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:04,206
Well-fed, strong and tall horses.

942
02:06:04,516 --> 02:06:10,421
They were galloping.
Black, white, good and bad horses!

943
02:06:10,823 --> 02:06:17,228
Horses in the stables!
Target practice in the stables!

944
02:06:18,163 --> 02:06:20,256
Catapults in the stables!
In the stables...

945
02:06:21,133 --> 02:06:25,160
How the bottles broke!

946
02:06:26,005 --> 02:06:27,563
How targets would be
hit with catapults!

947
02:06:27,873 --> 02:06:31,934
How Mogambo galloped!
Mogambo was amazing, sir!

948
02:06:32,611 --> 02:06:33,839
Why are you screaming?

949
02:06:34,713 --> 02:06:36,874
He told me that you
are hard of hearing.

950
02:06:37,383 --> 02:06:44,653
- When did I say so?
- Hadn't you said so at the door?

951
02:06:45,224 --> 02:06:48,455
You have not said what
I brought you here to say.

952
02:06:49,495 --> 02:06:52,987
About Karan and Arjun...
What did you say? Nothing!

953
02:06:53,632 --> 02:06:55,600
Tell him about Karan and Arjun!

954
02:06:57,336 --> 02:06:59,804
- Who are Karan and Arjun?
- You'll have me killed!

955
02:07:00,673 --> 02:07:03,107
You will have me slapped!
Hey, that...

956
02:07:04,910 --> 02:07:08,744
They were looking so dashing, sir!

957
02:07:09,448 --> 02:07:13,009
How they fought! They
killed everybody one by one!

958
02:07:13,986 --> 02:07:17,353
Karan and Arjun are amazing!

959
02:07:19,291 --> 02:07:22,124
- Where did you see them?
- On television, sir,

960
02:07:22,861 --> 02:07:26,092
He showed me 'Mahabharata'
on TV He told me to tell you...

961
02:07:26,365 --> 02:07:28,925
...that I had seen Karan and
Arjun and even gave Rs.100.

962
02:07:29,234 --> 02:07:29,928
No!

963
02:07:30,402 --> 02:07:32,165
No! No!

964
02:07:35,007 --> 02:07:39,944
Sir... he is... lying!

965
02:07:40,946 --> 02:07:43,039
- Have you come to joke with me?
- No!

966
02:07:46,285 --> 02:07:49,277
Henceforth, if you
play such a prank...

967
02:07:49,521 --> 02:07:51,853
...you will not even
be able to talk!

968
02:07:52,591 --> 02:07:53,387
Get out!

969
02:07:56,128 --> 02:07:57,652
- Come on!
- My work is done!

970
02:07:59,098 --> 02:08:01,498
I am as close to you
as your own heart beat.

971
02:08:02,167 --> 02:08:09,039
At the earliest opportunity
I'll free you and take you away.

972
02:08:10,743 --> 02:08:14,042
- Daughter-in-law!
- What are you doing?

973
02:08:14,580 --> 02:08:15,877
I will turn mad!

974
02:08:16,648 --> 02:08:20,709
I saw them with my own eyes.
You must be very happy.

975
02:08:21,487 --> 02:08:25,548
Your powerful sons have returned
to answer the Thakur's atrocities!

976
02:08:26,125 --> 02:08:33,054
But the villagers say
they haven't come.

977
02:08:34,233 --> 02:08:38,761
You tell me whether they have come.

978
02:08:39,538 --> 02:08:42,974
How can a mother's sons stay away
after hearing her call out to them?

979
02:08:44,743 --> 02:08:49,578
When a mother is tormented,
even the skies are in turmoil.

980
02:08:50,883 --> 02:08:53,317
They are with me.

981
02:08:54,853 --> 02:08:55,979
There they are.

982
02:09:00,826 --> 02:09:03,454
These are Karan and Arjun!

983
02:09:04,596 --> 02:09:09,260
The same face!
The same body! The same eyes!

984
02:09:10,536 --> 02:09:14,768
The Thakur is dead!

985
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:16,304
Yes.

986
02:09:17,509 --> 02:09:21,878
Spring has returned to my dreary life.

987
02:09:24,049 --> 02:09:26,040
Durjan Singh started this war.

988
02:09:27,386 --> 02:09:29,251
But my sons will finish it.

989
02:09:31,256 --> 02:09:34,692
I am with you in this battle!

990
02:09:47,339 --> 02:09:49,671
Check if everything is all right.

991
02:09:52,911 --> 02:09:56,608
Yes Dad. They are the same
weapons that I had selected.

992
02:10:10,162 --> 02:10:14,531
- Take this.
- We'll take the truck to the godown.

993
02:10:15,100 --> 02:10:16,397
And dispatch it from there.

994
02:10:18,370 --> 02:10:21,737
Be careful. No mistakes this time.

995
02:10:22,641 --> 02:10:24,165
Or we'll suffer heavy losses.

996
02:10:24,643 --> 02:10:28,545
This contains our
profit too not only yours.

997
02:10:29,248 --> 02:10:32,547
We have as much a share
in it as you do. Don't worry.

998
02:10:33,352 --> 02:10:38,585
- Go on then.
- But what's the hurry?

999
02:10:39,324 --> 02:10:41,986
First let the band play.

1000
02:10:42,527 --> 02:10:46,827
What band? Whose band?

1001
02:10:47,633 --> 02:10:49,225
His band and his too.

1002
02:10:49,968 --> 02:10:54,405
It was your command.

1003
02:10:56,675 --> 02:10:58,609
You have organized a party.

1004
02:10:59,711 --> 02:11:02,874
I've made such fantastic
arrangements that you!

1005
02:11:04,283 --> 02:11:05,648
You'll be left agape!

1006
02:17:00,939 --> 02:17:02,167
Where are the weapons?

1007
02:17:03,642 --> 02:17:05,803
Did the earth swallow them
or the sky eat them up?

1008
02:17:06,845 --> 02:17:09,075
I want to know how the arms
vanished from the truck?

1009
02:17:09,381 --> 02:17:12,942
The cost over a crore!
Who is responsible for this?

1010
02:17:13,652 --> 02:17:17,088
The bottle of wine is responsible.

1011
02:17:17,856 --> 02:17:23,192
They must be drunk lying
somewhere like rotten dogs!

1012
02:17:25,897 --> 02:17:28,923
For your avarice, you cheated us!

1013
02:17:29,734 --> 02:17:32,703
If you think you'll
make money off me...

1014
02:17:33,538 --> 02:17:37,872
Then you won't hear
the clink of that money!

1015
02:17:39,444 --> 02:17:40,968
You'll hear the screams of death!

1016
02:17:42,347 --> 02:17:43,712
The screech of your death!

1017
02:17:45,250 --> 02:17:49,710
I don't like anybody cheating me!

1018
02:17:51,556 --> 02:17:54,957
Tell me where the arms have vanished!

1019
02:17:55,460 --> 02:17:59,521
Or I'll throw the curtain
of death on both of you!

1020
02:18:01,733 --> 02:18:02,791
The curtain of death!

1021
02:18:03,802 --> 02:18:05,861
I want the arms! The weapons!

1022
02:18:08,206 --> 02:18:10,640
We have never been so badly
insulted until today.

1023
02:18:11,710 --> 02:18:16,147
Yes, Shamsher! We will come
out clean from this degradation!

1024
02:18:16,981 --> 02:18:17,777
But how?

1025
02:18:20,185 --> 02:18:23,882
Irrespective of the truth,
Karan and Arjun have a hand in it.

1026
02:18:24,789 --> 02:18:26,313
Both of us have seen them.

1027
02:18:27,859 --> 02:18:31,226
Until we throw those two dogs
at brother-in-law's feet...

1028
02:18:32,397 --> 02:18:35,230
...neither will the truth surface...

1029
02:18:36,101 --> 02:18:38,626
Nor will brother-in-law believe us.

1030
02:18:40,438 --> 02:18:43,635
But how do we reach Karan and Arjun?

1031
02:18:48,146 --> 02:18:49,807
There is one way.

1032
02:18:50,148 --> 02:18:52,241
Mother! Mother!

1033
02:18:58,022 --> 02:18:59,489
Hey! He is Usha's son.

1034
02:19:00,792 --> 02:19:02,453
Usha... your son.

1035
02:19:04,896 --> 02:19:07,660
Son! What happened to my child?

1036
02:19:12,003 --> 02:19:14,335
Get up! What happened?

1037
02:19:20,612 --> 02:19:24,639
"If you do not send Karan and
Arjun to the hill within an hour...

1038
02:19:25,016 --> 02:19:27,917
...then we'll start sending the
corpse of every child here."

1039
02:19:36,661 --> 02:19:43,658
I think, Karan and Arjun
have not got our letter.

1040
02:19:44,402 --> 02:19:46,666
We will have to send
another letter. Understand?

1041
02:19:56,181 --> 02:19:57,341
Hey! Come here!

1042
02:19:59,617 --> 02:20:00,606
Yes, you!

1043
02:20:05,490 --> 02:20:08,948
Do not kill me!
Do not kill me!

1044
02:20:10,028 --> 02:20:11,393
Run or I will shoot!

1045
02:20:12,997 --> 02:20:16,057
Help!

1046
02:20:25,743 --> 02:20:29,372
Did you see? Our hunters have
come here as our victims!

1047
02:20:30,014 --> 02:20:31,276
I will kill the rascals!

1048
02:20:31,683 --> 02:20:37,019
No. No! First we will
show them to brother-in-law.

1049
02:20:37,956 --> 02:20:40,447
And prove that we were right
and that the villagers lied.

1050
02:20:42,794 --> 02:20:44,762
- We have come.
- Leave the children.

1051
02:20:52,470 --> 02:20:54,233
Get up!

1052
02:21:02,847 --> 02:21:03,836
Leave the children.

1053
02:21:12,357 --> 02:21:14,518
Now we will take you
to brother-in-law.

1054
02:21:28,606 --> 02:21:29,630
Why did you stop?

1055
02:21:38,416 --> 02:21:39,383
Garlands?

1056
02:21:40,652 --> 02:21:43,553
These are the garlands which we
gave her to put on her sons' picture.

1057
02:21:44,322 --> 02:21:46,586
These garlands will
seal your fate today.

1058
02:21:47,492 --> 02:21:49,585
They will become
flowers for your bier.

1059
02:21:52,964 --> 02:21:54,329
Flowers for our bier?

1060
02:21:54,933 --> 02:21:58,562
Old woman! I think we should
read out your last rites too...

1061
02:21:59,170 --> 02:22:02,333
...along with Karan and Arjun's.

1062
02:22:04,108 --> 02:22:05,405
Shamsher, start the jeep!

1063
02:24:43,301 --> 02:24:44,233
What???

1064
02:25:02,987 --> 02:25:08,550
- These are the same guns.
- Thieves caught with the loot.

1065
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:13,492
They must have had a fight over
the loot and killed each other!

1066
02:25:14,599 --> 02:25:17,159
You had nurtured snakes!

1067
02:25:17,668 --> 02:25:21,263
Snakes? Call them pythons!

1068
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:24,904
Someday they would have
swallowed the mansion too!

1069
02:25:25,309 --> 02:25:26,571
They made a hole in my boat!

1070
02:25:27,178 --> 02:25:32,138
Good the bastards died.

1071
02:25:33,417 --> 02:25:36,409
Or they would drown themselves
- I did.

1072
02:25:43,761 --> 02:25:46,628
These weapons are worth millions.

1073
02:25:47,165 --> 02:25:48,223
And you have called the police?

1074
02:25:48,833 --> 02:25:52,269
Give it a thought. If the
landlord was caught with the arms...

1075
02:25:52,537 --> 02:25:57,565
The police would have imprisoned
the landlord, his son and you.

1076
02:25:58,209 --> 02:26:01,940
It would have been dangerous.
So I put the blame on these two.

1077
02:26:06,083 --> 02:26:07,482
- Greetings, sir!
- Greetings!

1078
02:26:08,152 --> 02:26:10,518
It's good you informed us
through your man.

1079
02:26:11,823 --> 02:26:15,384
Your brothers-in-law
indulged in illegal arms.

1080
02:26:17,361 --> 02:26:19,454
Yes. I just heard about it.

1081
02:26:20,598 --> 02:26:23,431
They killed each other
for money and arms.

1082
02:26:24,535 --> 02:26:26,867
They have brought disgrace
to the family's name.

1083
02:26:30,441 --> 02:26:33,069
Madam! The landlord is damned!

1084
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:35,209
This is called killing
2 birds with one stone!

1085
02:26:35,646 --> 02:26:38,809
Goods worth millions damned,
and Nahar and Shamsher too...

1086
02:26:39,116 --> 02:26:40,208
...are damned!

1087
02:26:40,918 --> 02:26:43,853
Let alone Nahar and Shamsher...

1088
02:26:44,655 --> 02:26:46,316
...Even Durjan Singh
would not have been saved!

1089
02:26:48,893 --> 02:26:50,155
- Bindiya!
- Shut up!

1090
02:26:50,494 --> 02:26:52,291
Bindiya, give me some grams.

1091
02:26:56,234 --> 02:26:57,360
Put some more.

1092
02:26:58,803 --> 02:26:59,792
Some more.

1093
02:27:02,206 --> 02:27:03,138
- Hey, you!
- Yes?

1094
02:27:03,774 --> 02:27:07,676
Eating so many grams. Were you
a horse in your previous birth?

1095
02:27:09,413 --> 02:27:10,880
- What are you eating?
- Biscuit.

1096
02:27:11,716 --> 02:27:12,978
Were you a dog in your last birth?

1097
02:27:13,251 --> 02:27:16,584
Eat grams!
Eat biscuits.

1098
02:27:18,222 --> 02:27:21,589
Nahar and Shamsher are no more.

1099
02:27:22,093 --> 02:27:23,856
When will the rest who are left?

1100
02:27:24,195 --> 02:27:26,425
When will they be damned?

1101
02:27:27,431 --> 02:27:30,696
Our hands are tied as long as
Sonia is their prisoner.

1102
02:27:31,469 --> 02:27:34,267
- Who is she?
- Mother...

1103
02:27:36,107 --> 02:27:37,438
Your daughter-in-law.

1104
02:27:37,975 --> 02:27:43,675
Yes and Durjan wants to
make her his daughter-in-law.

1105
02:27:45,583 --> 02:27:48,279
Wedding bugles will never
play in that mansion!

1106
02:27:49,287 --> 02:27:50,811
Only the Death March!

1107
02:35:23,907 --> 02:35:27,001
Why do you look so scared?

1108
02:35:29,480 --> 02:35:33,143
I think I saw them in the temple.

1109
02:35:33,350 --> 02:35:36,911
No! How cans this happen?

1110
02:35:39,556 --> 02:35:40,545
But...

1111
02:35:41,759 --> 02:35:43,158
Who were they?

1112
02:35:44,795 --> 02:35:47,593
- Who were they?
- Daddy, they're Ajay and Vijay.

1113
02:35:48,298 --> 02:35:49,390
Who are Ajay and Vijay?

1114
02:35:50,234 --> 02:35:53,670
The same fools who were
in the temple, sir.

1115
02:35:54,271 --> 02:35:58,640
The ones you thought were Karan
and Arjun are Ajay and Vijay.

1116
02:35:59,143 --> 02:36:01,475
What nonsense, Madam!

1117
02:36:01,979 --> 02:36:06,439
Two Ajay and Vijay; Two Karan
and Arjun. That makes 4 of them!

1118
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:14,084
A bier too needs four shoulders!
Be careful, sir!

1119
02:36:14,925 --> 02:36:17,587
Our stars indeed seem
to be inauspicious.

1120
02:36:18,095 --> 02:36:21,997
Weapons worth millions were seized;
your brothers-in-law were killed.

1121
02:36:22,733 --> 02:36:26,225
Now Ajay and Vijay.
There is some problem or the other.

1122
02:36:27,304 --> 02:36:29,534
I want the marriage
plans to stop for now.

1123
02:36:29,907 --> 02:36:31,465
I will return to the
city with my daughter.

1124
02:36:32,042 --> 02:36:32,872
Stop the marriage?

1125
02:36:33,777 --> 02:36:40,012
Till yesterday, you were my
business partner in profit and loss.

1126
02:36:40,551 --> 02:36:44,612
But now that we are related, you
Is a partner in joy and in sorrow.

1127
02:36:46,190 --> 02:36:47,487
The marriage will not be postponed.

1128
02:36:48,292 --> 02:36:49,987
It will be held on the day we decided!

1129
02:36:50,794 --> 02:36:52,887
- But...
- If you become adamant...

1130
02:36:53,931 --> 02:36:56,866
Then not you, but your corpse
will leave for the city!

1131
02:37:03,740 --> 02:37:05,332
- Apologize?
- Yes dear.

1132
02:37:06,376 --> 02:37:08,003
I am ashamed of my deeds.

1133
02:37:09,179 --> 02:37:13,479
I fixed your marriage
in the wrong family.

1134
02:37:14,551 --> 02:37:20,490
The man who can threaten
to kill his friend...

1135
02:37:22,159 --> 02:37:23,353
He is capable of anything.

1136
02:37:25,429 --> 02:37:29,388
That is why I cannot bear to
see you thrust in this hellhole!

1137
02:37:31,835 --> 02:37:34,565
Your Vijay has come here.

1138
02:37:35,672 --> 02:37:36,969
Elope with him.

1139
02:37:45,148 --> 02:37:46,080
Yes my dear.

1140
02:37:47,985 --> 02:37:49,646
I've brought you up with great love.

1141
02:37:51,054 --> 02:37:52,521
Don't cry my child.

1142
02:37:53,624 --> 02:37:55,717
I can't bear tears in your eyes.

1143
02:37:57,227 --> 02:38:01,220
I'll plan out how to help you
to run away from this house.

1144
02:38:22,753 --> 02:38:23,617
Where are you running off to?

1145
02:38:24,288 --> 02:38:26,415
Stop or I'll shoot!

1146
02:38:31,495 --> 02:38:33,019
- But Daddy, you?
- Don't worry about me.

1147
02:38:33,530 --> 02:38:34,428
Run away!

1148
02:38:43,240 --> 02:38:46,641
For my sake, run!

1149
02:38:52,849 --> 02:38:54,146
Brother!

1150
02:38:56,620 --> 02:38:58,417
Some girl is screaming out Vijay!

1151
02:39:11,335 --> 02:39:14,236
You and here?

1152
02:39:14,805 --> 02:39:17,865
Daddy acquiesced in the
light of our love.

1153
02:39:18,575 --> 02:39:21,976
He understood that my life
would be ruined with that man.

1154
02:39:53,744 --> 02:39:59,614
Saw that? People use
goats to hunt tigers.

1155
02:40:00,450 --> 02:40:02,645
I used my daughter.

1156
02:40:05,856 --> 02:40:11,351
I thought nobody in this
world was worse than me.

1157
02:40:12,629 --> 02:40:15,792
But you showed what a bastard
you can be at the right time.

1158
02:40:17,501 --> 02:40:19,366
That I've become
slave to your lowness!

1159
02:40:20,771 --> 02:40:22,864
I'll kill that rascal in such a way...

1160
02:40:24,141 --> 02:40:27,167
That God will end this
system of rebirth!

1161
02:40:29,513 --> 02:40:31,037
Go! Bring her to me!

1162
02:40:32,616 --> 02:40:35,585
When Arjun has come,
Karan too will follow!

1163
02:40:42,693 --> 02:40:43,557
Kill him!

1164
02:40:55,372 --> 02:40:56,964
Where have these two gone?

1165
02:40:57,908 --> 02:40:58,840
There!

1166
02:41:03,847 --> 02:41:04,779
Follow them!

1167
02:41:47,257 --> 02:41:49,191
- What happened?
- There's nobody in the village.

1168
02:41:50,527 --> 02:41:52,256
- The village is abandoned.
- What?

1169
02:41:53,530 --> 02:41:56,431
- Nobody in the village?
- Yes, the village is empty.

1170
02:41:57,400 --> 02:41:59,197
Have the villagers died?

1171
02:42:02,706 --> 02:42:07,268
Have they died before they
witnesses the flames of my anger?

1172
02:42:08,779 --> 02:42:11,577
You, who gave shelter to my enemies...

1173
02:42:12,415 --> 02:42:15,043
I won't give you place to be cremated!

1174
02:42:17,087 --> 02:42:22,582
Your corpses will rot away
on the roads like stray dogs!

1175
02:42:24,327 --> 02:42:25,885
Where have they all gone!

1176
02:42:27,898 --> 02:42:29,388
Rascals! Scoundrels!

1177
02:42:47,484 --> 02:42:48,473
What is it?

1178
02:42:54,457 --> 02:43:01,329
I am alive only to see you
being tortured like this.

1179
02:43:03,066 --> 02:43:06,729
You played with blood!
Today I will watch...

1180
02:43:07,971 --> 02:43:11,532
Whose blood will flow and
whose corpses will fall!

1181
02:43:14,211 --> 02:43:15,405
How can you kill me?

1182
02:43:16,246 --> 02:43:17,907
Death stands at your head!

1183
02:43:24,020 --> 02:43:25,544
Master is damned!

1184
02:43:27,657 --> 02:43:30,319
- Rascal!
- Shoot him!

1185
02:44:11,201 --> 02:44:12,634
Shut the gate!

1186
02:44:27,017 --> 02:44:28,416
They have come!

1187
02:44:46,770 --> 02:44:47,566
Let go!

1188
02:46:07,217 --> 02:46:08,081
Catch.

1189
02:47:35,038 --> 02:47:36,062
You rascal! Hoodlum!

1190
02:47:41,010 --> 02:47:42,375
How did this happen?

1191
02:49:26,216 --> 02:49:29,583
Son! What happened my son?

1192
02:49:33,022 --> 02:49:35,149
What happened son?

1193
02:49:43,466 --> 02:49:45,161
My son!

1194
02:49:52,775 --> 02:49:55,039
Karan Arjun killed my son!

1195
02:49:56,379 --> 02:49:59,348
They killed my son!

1196
02:50:03,286 --> 02:50:10,556
Those rascals killed your son-in-law.

1197
02:50:12,528 --> 02:50:14,519
They killed Sonia's husband!

1198
02:50:23,439 --> 02:50:25,703
They extinguished the
lamp of our family!

1199
02:50:26,643 --> 02:50:30,340
Control yourself.

1200
02:50:45,161 --> 02:50:46,526
What are you doing?

1201
02:51:05,281 --> 02:51:07,146
Did you see? I am in my senses!

1202
02:51:08,084 --> 02:51:12,350
There was no better way to
nab the murderers of my son!

1203
02:51:15,358 --> 02:51:18,555
My son died because of you!

1204
02:51:19,662 --> 02:51:22,927
And now those two rascals
will die thanks to you!

1205
02:51:23,800 --> 02:51:25,734
Because of you! You!

1206
02:51:27,904 --> 02:51:30,771
Those rascals will die because of you!

1207
02:51:42,352 --> 02:51:43,649
Quietly walk towards me.

1208
02:51:44,787 --> 02:51:47,347
Don't act smart! Come!

1209
02:52:14,283 --> 02:52:15,580
Old hag!

1210
02:52:16,185 --> 02:52:17,675
Death is not at my head!

1211
02:52:18,921 --> 02:52:23,449
Instead I am standing in
front of them like Death!

1212
02:53:40,369 --> 02:53:41,427
Save me!

1213
02:53:42,505 --> 02:53:44,200
Karan and Arjun will kill me!

1214
02:53:45,241 --> 02:53:46,333
Forgive me.

1215
02:53:49,712 --> 02:53:53,148
This is the garland you gave me.

1216
02:53:54,317 --> 02:53:57,343
It has been piercing my heart
like a thorn till today.

1217
02:53:59,856 --> 02:54:06,227
Today I will throw this same
garland on your dead body.

1218
02:54:06,562 --> 02:54:07,893
And then I'll be at peace.

1219
02:54:08,130 --> 02:54:10,064
And your sins will be terminated.

1220
02:54:14,203 --> 02:54:17,695
Finish him!
