00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,535
Like When the objects
start to get cIose together.

5
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,439
That sick feeIing,

6
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,172
Iike a vibration, aImost, in here.

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,346
I've been feeIing that for a WhiIe noW.

00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,212
- I thought it Was just nerves.
- It's the moteI.

00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,786
AII the objects, the key,

00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,856

11
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,254
You kneW this Was here the WhoIe time?

12
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,087
It's a bad pIace.

00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:52,941
- See, the objects Wanna

18
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,816
You think it Was an accident, us meeting?

19
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,321
You think finding
the PoIaroid Was an accident?

20
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,789
I may have shoWn you the Way,

21
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,986
but, uh, the objects brought you here.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,074
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

23
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,202
- Where's Room 10?
- There is no Room 10.

24
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,369
It never existed.

25
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:24,847
At Ieast not after
May the 4th, 1961 .

26
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,820
You knoW What that is?

27
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,891
Object chart.
I've seen one before.

28
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,873
You toId him!

29
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,846
- Martin Ruber.
- Yes.

30
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,209
Do you beIieve in the reunification of God?

31
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,614
Do you beIieve in the truth?

32
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,117
The Order?

33
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,085
The neW reIigion?

34
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,349
Yes.

35
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,319
Do you reject your former Iife?

36
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,124
Do you give yourseIf to The Order?

37
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,191
Yes.

38
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,922
Then pray.

39
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,012
Pray to this object.

40
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,913
What is it?

41
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,248
It's a piece of God...

42
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,215
Iike every other object.

43
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,786
And I Want you to pray to it.

44
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,768
If We can reunite aII the objects,

45
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,902
We can restore the mind of God.

46
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,407
We can communicate With God

47
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,781
for the first time in human history.

48
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,381
- Do you beIieve that, Martin?
- Yes. Yes, I beIieve.

49
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,888
Then open your eyes
and embrace The Order.

50
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,910
Stupid.

51
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,478
Arrogant.

52
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,380
You Iive onIy because
I Was once Iike you.

53
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,747
But you WiII Iearn, Martin.

54
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,787
Thank me for this mercy.

55
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,432
Thank you.

56
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,088
The moteI room key

57
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,757
is the most important object
to The Order right noW.

58
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,027
Margaret, I Want your group
to find Joe MiIIer

59
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,367
and take the key.

60
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,909
We can't have another
screW-up Iike Michigan.

61
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,035
Ray Cory's group in NeW York

62
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,546

63
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,309
WiII act as support if necessary.

64
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,910
I understand Dr. Ruber
knoWs Joe MiIIer personaIIy,

65
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,512
Which is Why the job is yours.

66
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,184
I don't think Dr. Ruber is in any kind
of shape to heIp us,

67
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,954
considering his
faIIing out With MiIIer.

68
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,222
That's exactIy Why MiIIer WiII taIk to me.

69
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,861
He'd Iike to kiII me.

70
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,004
There's no such things as ghosts.

71
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,575
Fine. I'm just asking you.
You sWear you didn't see her?

72
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,938
Didn't see her.

73
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,877
I don't beIieve in ghosts, aII right?

74
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,004
Yeah, me neither.

75
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,912
I mean, magic bus ticket,
sure, but ghosts, no.

76
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,075
Look, I've seen the bus ticket, aII right?

77
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,675
- With my eyes I seen it.
- WeII, I saW her.

78
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,016
And you knoW, Whatever
she is, she Was there.

79
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,090
Here.

80
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,554
Tape that doWn.

81
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,286
Are you ready?
Let's go.

82
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,969
I feeI stupid.

83
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,096
Just give it a sec.

84
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,862
Great.
The camera's broken.

85
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,507
You knoW, I might be
abIe to dig it out and fix it.

86
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,701
The key's okay.

87
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,515
Yeah, MiIIer.

88
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,209
Joe, it's Ruber.

89
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,480
We need to taIk about
your daughter.

90
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,528
What do you Want, Ruber?

91
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,039
I Wanna heIp you get

92
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,769

93
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,311
Any thoughts about getting Lou back?

94
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,372
I've joined a group, Joe.
A cabaI.

95
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,508
They're caIIed The Order
of the Reunification.

96
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:50,248
They beIieve in the objects.
They Want to use them.

97
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:54,793
Do you have any idea
hoW poWerfuI the objects reaIIy are?

98
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,658
The Order thinks that if they can
get aII the objects back together,

99
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,496
they can taIk to God.

100
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,568
That's insane.

101
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,432
Come With me to The Order.

102
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,096
Give us the key.

103
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,972
If anybody can bring Anna back,
We can, together.

104
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,843
Some day, Ruber,
you're gonna get What comin' to ya.

105
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,849
Some day you're gonna need me, Joe.

106
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,060
I aImost got this thing Workin'.

107
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,429
Can We make animaI pancakes?

108
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,195
What kind of animaI pancakes you Want?

109
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,531
EIephants.

110
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,003
AII right, WeII, I don't knoW hoW

111
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,266
but hoW about a mouse?

112
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,500

00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,177
Okay-okay-okay.

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,894

00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,301
WoW.

117
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,802
She's disintegrating.

118
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:15,032
You see, somehoW the key
brings her back just for a feW seconds

119
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,666
into our time and space.

120
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:22,714
What's it Iike for her the rest of the time
When she's not in our space?

121
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,680
I don't knoW.

122
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,945
But Anna may be trapped in the same pIace.

123
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,352
We need to find out Who she is.

124
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,687
- You sure you knoW Where you're going?
- Yes.

125
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,885
HoW much further?

126
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,292
I don't knoW.
Not much.

127
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,556
Doesn't seem Iike
much of a shortcut.

128
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:42,259
PIease, don't compIain to me noW.

129
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,767
- Hey, What's the name of this toWn?
- I don't remember.

130
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,461
Nobody goes there anymore.

131
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,731
Why not?

132
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,808
You knoW, the questions
get reaIIy boring after a WhiIe.

133
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,309
I don't knoW the name of the toWn, okay?
It doesn't matter.

134
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,311
What it Was a Iong a time ago,

135
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,278
- You're trespassing'.
- Sorry.

136
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,947
Look, We didn't knoW anybody Iived here.
We're just headed into the toWn.

137
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,188
There ain't a toWn anymore.

138
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:17,793
FriendIy.

139
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,063
That's Why I don't Iike comin' here.

140
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,770

00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,942
I've been here a coupIe times.

147
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,240
I don't Iike it in there.

148

Bus station's that Way.

151
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,532
I'm not Iooking for
the bus station.

152
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,830

Yeah, I'd Iike to knoW

162
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,443
What's the matter?
I can't ask a simpIe question?

163
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,716
What happened at that moteI?

164
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,980
MoteI's haunted.

165
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,819
What do you mean, haunted?

166
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,415
There's these peopIe out of noWhere

It used to hardIy

00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,829
NoW it happens aII the time.

171

AII right, What about
the Woman at the moteI?

172
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,174
The Woman?

173
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,343
The ghost?

174
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,072
Who's seen her?

175
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,545
Nobody, huh?

176
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,114
I'II take the rest to the booth.

177
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,795
I knoW I'm not haIIucinating,
but I feeI Iike I'm Iosin' it.

178
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,160
You're Iosing it?
You see these peopIe?

179
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,426
They're Iiving a miIe and a haIf from that moteI.

180
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,434
It's making 'em haIf-crazy,
and they don't even knoW Why.

181
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:08,939
Most peopIe Ieft a WhiIe ago, but...

182
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,066
a Iot of 'em never figured out--
What?

183
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,179
There's our ghost.

184
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,587
Hi.

185
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,418
You Wanna come in?

186
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,958
Oh, I don't think so.

187
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,604
Better?
Much.

188
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,304
I'm gonna ask you a question.

189
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,905
Do you recognize her?

190
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,007
No.

191
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,483
Who is she?

192
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,417
She's a Woman I saW at the moteI.

193
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,787
The actuaI moteI in room number 9.

194
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,560
What's Wrong?

195
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,858
Joe, don't go back there.

196
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,097
- You kneW about it?
- You WouIdn't understand.

197
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,833
What WouIdn't I understand, Jennifer?

198
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,808
That's the guy from the hospice, isn't it?

199
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,181
He's my brother.

200
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,878
DreW.

201
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,819
We aII have reasons
to get rid of the objects.

202
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,618
DreW's my reason.

203
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,786
He became obsessed With Room 9.

204
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:41,332
And Whatever happened to him in there
destroyed him.

205
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,560
So, Joe, you promise me
you Won't go back there.

206
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,748
I am sorry about your brother.

207
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,647
I reaIIy am.

208
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,982
But I have to go back because
Whatever's happening to that Woman

209
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,612
couId be happening to Anna right noW.

210
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,624
So I'm gonna find out the names
of everyone in this picture,

211
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,318
and hopefuIIy I can
taIk to one of them.

212
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,827
Because if I can
bring that Woman back,

213
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,056
I can bring Anna back.

214
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,393
I knoW it.

215
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,020
My brother's research on Room 9.

216
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,196
WoW.

217
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,502
Yeah.

218
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,736
Home sWeet home.

219
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,127
Jennifer, I--

220
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,252
You aII right?

221
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,290
Yeah.

222
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,534
Just don't break my heart.

223
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,369
Don't break mine.

224
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,980
Jennifer, get dressed.
We have to go.

225
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,489
What's going on?

226
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,752
Get everything

227
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,577
It's stiII here.

228
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,780
Whoever made that print
Was here in 1961 .

229
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,687
I think my brother identified
the peopIe in this photo.

230
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:01,952
They're the CoIIectors.

231
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,323
The Woman you saW Was
the moteI manager in 1966.

232
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,899
ArIene Conroy.

233
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,966
ArIene Conroy.

234
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,465
Woman in the picture, right?

235
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:15,904
Yeah.

236
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,507
What happened to the rest of them?

237
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,604
Everyone eIse is dead.

238
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,985
We need to find out
Who this beIongs to.

239
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,874
Somebody in there?

240
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,104
Yeah, just Workin' Iate.

241
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,112
Who's in there?
Pendegrass?

242
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,476
Yeah, buddy?

243
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,045
I've seen this guy.

244
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,179
I'II be damned.

245
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,813
Who the heII's in there?

246
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,331
Come on.

247
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,877
Who the heII are you?
Get outta my house!

248
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,148
Gus Jacobs, I Wanna knoW
about ArIene Conroy.

249
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,893
I've seen her.

250
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,256
At the moteI.

251
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,733
PIease, teII me What happened.

252
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,305
I don't knoW.

253
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,236
I don't knoW.

254
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,607
I Wish to God
I couId heIp her.

255
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,645
She's my Wife.

256
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,498
My daughter disappeared
inside that moteI room,

257
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,431
same as your Wife.

258
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,204
She's onIy eight years oId.

259
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,499
Oh, God.

260
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,037
I'm sorry.

261
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,578
PIease, heIp me.

262
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,044
TeII me What happened in Room 9.

263
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,047
Do you knoW hoW the objects Were created?

264
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,283
Were you and ArIene invoIved somehoW?

265
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:47,756
No.

266
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,588
God, no.
HoW couId We?

267
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:55,132
We just ran the moteI, that's aII.

268
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,531
ArIene managed it,
I Was the janitor.

269
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,263
It Was just a reguIar pIace.

270
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,668
It's not Iike something happened.

271
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,233
It's Iike afterward,
We figured something must've happened.

272
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,371
The moteI onIy has
nine rooms, right?

273
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:14,851
Except, one day ArIene finds
the key to Room 10.

274
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,183
We tried the key and...

275
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,749
WeII, I suppose you knoW What We saW.

276
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,226
There Were stiII a feW objects inside.

277
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,456
I didn't Want any of it.

278
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,863
But ArIene got this Iook in her eye.

279
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,061
She Wanted to get aII the objects back.

280
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,071
She got some of our friends invoIved.

281
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,765
Pretty soon,
We Were this group.

282
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,206
The CoIIectors.

283
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:46,874
By '66, We had found aImost aII the objects.

284
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:51,285
And since there Wasn't a Room 10,
ArIene started experimenting in Room 9.

285
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,983
And finaIIy she found the Watch box.

286
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,296
And that's When everything Went Wrong.

287
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,955
What do you mean ''Went Wrong''?

288
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,261
It's easier if I shoW you.

289
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:12,907
This is a copy.
The originaI Was stoIen years ago.

290
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,362
She Iooks the same.

291
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:37,265
God, she Iooks exactIy the same.

292
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,736
ArIene had been Iooking for
the five objects for years.

293
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,898
She said With
the right combination,

294
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,034
she couId open the door the right Way.

295
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,444
I think she Was insane by then.

296
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,446
Then I gave her the Watch box.

297
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,248
And everything Went bad.

298
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,159
She opened the door, and it Was Iike...

299
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,421
Iike she opened a tear in reaIity.

300
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,731
What the heII is happening?

301
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,930
Gus, Was this fiIm spIiced together?

302
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,972
No.

303
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,008
It's one continuous piece of fiIm.

304
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,772
ArIene sacrificed herseIf to end it.

305
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,996
I saW ArIene a feW months Iater,
at the moteI.

306
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,332
Just for a feW seconds.

307
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,133
She begged me to heIp her.

308
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,106
I couIdn't.
I didn't knoW hoW.

309
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,370
I got rid of the key, and...

310
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,673
I never Went back.

311
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,840
I changed names, traveIed aII over.

312
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,521
EventuaIIy, I came back.

313
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,681
I guess I just Want be near her.

314
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,151
Gus, What does the box do?

315
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,227
May I take this fiIm?

316
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,132
Take it.

317
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,898
I never Wanna Watch it again.

318
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,237
And if you do find my Wife,

319
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,245
pIease put her out of her misery.

320
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,022
You're not gonna beIieve this, Detective.

321
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,683
We had a break-in Iast night.

322
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:42,919
Shut up.

323
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:46,293
Someone came in just to use
the fingerprint database.

324
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,559
They Iogged in under Joe MiIIer.

325
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,464
Why does Joe stiII have a Iogin?

326
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:51,865
WeII, We got a Iot on our pIate, Detective.

327
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,572
What Was he Iookin' for?

328
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,106
Okay. Looks Iike Joe MiIIer's
headed to NeW Mexico.

329
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,317
I think this must be the box.

330
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,148
WeII, if the key brings
Conroy back partIy,

331
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,586
maybe With the box,
she'II come back aII the Way.

332
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,022
I don't knoW.
Something's missing.

333
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,490
HoW do I get the box?

334
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,858
If you do this,
I'm going in With you.

335
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,830
There's Woman.
She's an object tracker.

336
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:26,927
She Won't deaI With the Legion,
but she might deaI With you.

337
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,972
Her name's Suzie Kang.

338
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:31,970
Who Was it referred you again?

339
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,806
I just heard your name around, that's aII.

340
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:34,936
You Work for the Legion?

341
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,571
- No.
- Good.

342
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:38,876
A bunch of scumbags.

343
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,974
AIWays trying to hide
the objects from everybody.

344
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,646
It's bad for business.
But they'II get theirs.

345
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:47,418
I'm on my oWn.
I have the key.

346
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,651
You're the neW moteI man.

347
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,557
- Joe MiIIer.
- Yeah. Whatever.

348
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,653
- Can I see the key?
- Can I point my gun at you?

349
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:53,788
I just Wanna see the key.

350
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,759
Oh, damn!

351
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,106
AII right, Mister Guy,
What are you Iookin' for?

352
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,202
The box.

353
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,472
Oh, WeII, that is totaIIy ungettabIe.

354
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,911
Where is it?

355
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,743
You knoW, I feeI bad for you
because you're stupid.

356
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,976
Thousand bucks.

357
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:42,907
The Watch box.

358
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,346
''Dampens entropy
for Iimited radius.''

359
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,748
I must've been
absent that day.

360
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,480
It prevents things
from decaying.

361
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,555
Who has it?

362
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,021
They caII themseIves The Order.

363
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,956
Very, very nasty cabaI.

364
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,823
Box Was their first object.

365
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,487
They base the WhoIe reIigion around it.

366
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:00,621
Thank you.

367
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,845
I guess if you Were
gonna shoot me--

368
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,107
Shut up and Iisten.

369
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,706
The Order has an object that
I need, the Watch box.

370
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,719
- Where do they keep it?
- I don't knoW.

371
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,015
Don't Iie to me, Ruber.

372
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,090
You'II never get near it, Joe.

373
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,385
Then cIose your eyes.

374
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,891
Listen to me, Joe.

375
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,257
You can't get the box, but I can.

376
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,729
- I'II get the box for you.
- Sit doWn.

377
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,937
Joe...

378
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,405
I Want to see the moteI room again.

379
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,408
I Wanna go inside.

380
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,977
Why?

381
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,638
Because When I saW that room,

382
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:54,309
I kneW that there Was something
in that room that I Was meant to see.

383
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,081
I don't knoW Why, Joe,
but I need to see it.

384
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,349
I need to get inside that room.

385
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,725
The onIy reason that you're aIive
is because I need that box.

386
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,533
You get the box,
you get inside the room.

387
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,104
If I make it out of there in one piece,

388
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,237
I promise I WiII find a Way to Wake you up.

389
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,515
Oh, my God, DreW.

390
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,118
The comb.

391
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,711
I Wanted to Iet you knoW I think I found
a Way to bring your Wife back.

392
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,677
AII you'II bring her is pain.

393
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,413
Just Iet it go, son.

394
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,993
I'm sorry, I have to give it a try.

395
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,392
Excuse me.

396
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,563
- MiIIer.
- Joe, Iisten.

397
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,195
The Iast object my brother
Was missing Was the comb.

398
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,467
I got it back from the Legion.

399
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,974
I'II be right there.

400
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,305
I have to go.

401
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,004
Joe...

402
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:37,282
ArIene didn't disappear
the same Way your daughter did.

403
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,787
ArIene had the key.

404
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,458
It Was the objects that ate her.

405
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,700
It Was the objects.

406
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,567
Joe MiIIer, you're under arrest for the
murder of Detective Lou Destefano

407
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,339

00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,590
Wanna make a statement?

409
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,692
Do you Want to make a statement?

Custody battIe.

TeII me What happened.

414
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:38,779

You knoW me.

416
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,413

Okay?

419
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,351

424
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,239

And if I have to rip the WorId in haIf

Up against the van.

00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,244
No, no, Joe!

445
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,251

459
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,495
The man.
The man in the picture.

460
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,724

Thank you.

468
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,423
I'm not the man in the picture.
I'm sorry.

469
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,691

470

471
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,199
She's Waiting for you, Joe.

472
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,690
She said she saW Anna.

473
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,568
I don't understand.

474
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,041
- What happened?
- I don't knoW.

475
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,669
But I think I knoW

476
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,509
This one.

477
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,547
What is that?

478
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,810
It's the room.

479
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,515
Oh, my God.

480
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,504
WouId you move, Ruber?

481
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,969
This must be exactIy
hoW the room Was in 1961 .

482
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,571
Just before the objects changed.

483
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,794
- What Was that?
- What?

484
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,099
What the heII is that?

485
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,634
It's a man.

486
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,178
This Was the occupant in Room 10.

487
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,842
IncredibIe.

488
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,425
Come on, Iet's go.

489
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,532
You can't Ieave me here, Joe.
I gave you the box.

490
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,067
We had a deaI.

491
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,671
Come on, Ruber!

492
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,309
Oh, my God.

493
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,505
I'm actuaIIy in the room.

494
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,756
He Was right here.

495
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,573
FeeI enIightened, Ruber?

496
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,199
Yes.

497
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,436
Yes, I am.

498
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,217
Objects don't Work
in the room, Ruber.

499
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,953
Enough!

500
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,789
No! Don't!

501
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,401
He stoIe it!

502
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:44,701
Doesn't matter.

503
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:46,732
Why?

504
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,341
The man in the room.

505
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,473
Yeah?

506
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,177
If I'm right, he's the prime object.

507
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,217
And We're gonna find him.
