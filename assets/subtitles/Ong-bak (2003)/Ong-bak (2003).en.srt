<i>The bust shows sign of wear,
the head's slightly chipped.</i>

16
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,000
<i>Hardly perfect condition!</i>

17
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,167
200,000 baht is a good price!

18
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,042
<i>Why won't you sell it?</i>

19
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:45,375
Name your price!

20
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,625
<i>Don, it's not for sale!</i>

<i>I've come all the way
from Bangkok!</i>

22
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,125

<i>For when he is
ordained as a monk!</i>

27
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,333
<i>When you decide to sell, call me!</i>

28
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:14,333
<i>Forget it! I don't have a telephone!</i>

29
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,833

00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:43,917
<i>I have taught you
the art of Muay Thai!</i>

51
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:47,667
<i>Now I ask you never to use it!</i>

52
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,292
<i>- Is that clear?
- Yes, master!</i>

53
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,375
<i>Good!</i>

54
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,792
<i>You're wondering why!!!</i>

55
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,375
Aren't you?

56
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:23,417
<i>In his youth, your master learned
the ancient art of Muay Thai!!!</i>

57
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:26,000
<i>Under the great master Kru Dam!</i>

58
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:32,083
<i>He was impatient
to try out his skills!</i>

59
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:37,000
<i>In a rope fistfight,
he killed his opponent!</i>

60
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:44,000
<i>Overcome with guilt,
he decided to become a monk!</i>

61
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,042
<i>Muay Thai is dangerous!</i>

62
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:53,375
<i>He doesn't want you fooling around
with it! Is it clear now?</i>

63
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,375
<i>If you're still not convinced!!!</i>

64
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,708
<i>Go a few rounds with me, Ting!</i>

65
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:07,833
Uncle!

00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:42,708
Huh?

67
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:46,958
Hey, you vandals!
What are you doing?

68
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,083
Move it!

69
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,833
<i>That scumbag Don!!!</i>

70
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:14,125
Severed the head of Ong-Bak!

71
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,750
<i>He also stole
the poor box, master.</i>

72
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:27,000
Don is a bastard!

73
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:32,083
<i>If we can't recover Ong-Bak's head...</i>

74
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,125
our village is doomed!

75
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,917
<i>Calm down.</i>

76
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:41,625
<i>We'll find a way!!!</i>

77
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:46,833
<i>To bring the Buddha's head back
before the great ceremony.</i>

78
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:50,292
<i>But who will bring it back?</i>

79
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll bring it back!

80
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,750
<i>I know where Don lives!</i>

81
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:06,667
<i>The fate of the whole village!!!</i>

82
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,625
<i>Lies in your hands!</i>

83
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,792
<i>This sacred amulet
contains Ninpat herbs!</i>

84
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:17,667
<i>My grandfather told me
it belonged to Kru Dam!</i>

85
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,833
<i>Keep it close to your heart!</i>

86
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,458
<i>Here's Don's address!</i>

87
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:33,792
<i>And please give this letter to Humlae!</i>

88
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,500
<i>Ting...</i>

89
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:41,375
<i>be sure to bring Ong-Bak
safely home to our village!</i>

90
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:55,333
<i>Here's some money for food!</i>

91
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:59,333
<i>All our hopes go with you!</i>

92
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:04,708
<i>Mother gave me this
before she died!</i>

93
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,958
<i>Take care of Grandmother!</i>

94
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,625
<i>Everybody...</i>

95
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:33,417
<i>give what you can!</i>

96
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,583
<i>For the journey!</i>

98
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,417
Shit, I lost!

99
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,792
Come here!

100
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,875
<i>Who'd you pick to race?
We lost by miles!</i>

101
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,792
<i>It was a fair race!
Win some, lose some!</i>

102
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,000
<i>You're being a bad loser!</i>

103
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,333
You put up a girl against me?

104
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:44,250
So I'm a girl! So what?

105
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,833
Do you know
who you're talking to?

106
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,417
<i>Shame you don't race
as fast as you talk!</i>

107
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:52,792
Screw you!

108
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:12,792
Here's 10,000! The rest's
security on your debts!

109
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:16,708
<i>I pay you interest every month
and it's not due yet!</i>

110
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,333
<i>Give me some so I can bet!</i>

111
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:23,375
<i>- Take it or leave it!
- I guess it's better than nothing!</i>

112
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,708
<i>Hey, give me those!</i>

113
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:44,792
<i>You got cash!
You can leave the tabs for my boys!</i>

114
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:49,958
<i>You guys can score
what you need anytime, anywhere!!!</i>

115
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,333
Why you wanna take mine?

116
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,875
<i>It's too strong
for these pussies, anyway!</i>

117
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,208
Hand it over, okay?

118
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,833
<i>Shithead!</i>

119
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,042
<i>There you are at last, George.</i>

120
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:29,667
<i>Where's my share?
Quick! I'm in a hurry!</i>

121
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,375
<i>That asshole Peng
got wise to our scam!</i>

122
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,375
<i>He kept all the money!</i>

123
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,625
What? If this is a joke
it's not funny!

124
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,042
Look! Check out my face!

125
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,042
You think I did that myself?

126
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:51,667
Hands off, I just got beat up!

127
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,792
<i>Your bad luck!
How could he tell?</i>

128
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,958
<i>Forget it! You got 200 baht?</i>

129
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:01,500
Hold on!
Pay up first, borrow later!

130
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:06,750
<i>You always take your share
of the dough!!!</i>

131
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,167
<i>But never your share
of the beatings!</i>

132
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,292
<i>You're the one who messed up!</i>

133
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,500
I messed up, smarty-pants?

134
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,500
<i>Peng has given me
three days to pay up...</i>

135
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,417
<i>or he'll come after me.</i>

136
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,625
<i>Humlae!!</i>

137
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,042
It is you, isn't it?

138
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,000
Greetings!

139
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,250
Is he a friend of yours?

140
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:38,167
<i>What do you mean?
He's talking to you!</i>

141
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,667
You know this hillbilly?

142
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,833
<i>Don't you remember me?
Ting from Nong Pradu!</i>

143
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:47,625
<i>Yeah, right! I don't know you!</i>

144
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,625
<i>I don't know you!
Got that, sucker?</i>

145
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,042
<i>I remember you! You're Humlae!</i>

146
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:57,542
<i>What kind of a name is that?
Dumbest name I ever heard!</i>

147
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,917
<i>Clear out before I kick your ass!!</i>

148
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,417
Go easy, Humlae...

149
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:04,875
George, I mean!

150
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,167
You are such a pain
in the ass, sister!

151
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,708
Get out of here!

152
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:14,833
<i>- What was the name of your village?
- Nong Pradu!</i>

153
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,875
<i>Right, I'll leave
the Nong Pradu boys to it!</i>

154
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,875
<i>You must have lots
to talk about!</i>

155
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,542
<i>He shows up and you take off!</i>

156
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,292
<i>Go then!
But leave me some dough!</i>

157
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,333
Buy yourself a Band-Aid!

158
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:32,667
<i>See ya, Humlae!</i>

159
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:39,208
As for you, country boy,
go back where you came from!

160
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,667
<i>Humlae, your dad
gave me a letter for you!</i>

161
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,000
<i>I don't know you! Scram!</i>

162
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:55,542
<i>This is my room!
Forget about earlier!</i>

163
00:18:55,625 --> 00:19:00,542
<i>Close the door
or it'll be swarming with mosquitoes!</i>

164
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,833
<i>I was out of line! Sorry!</i>

165
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:11,667
<i>You know, our village
is in big trouble!</i>

166
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:15,583
<i>Don and his men
stole Ong-Bak's head!</i>

167
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:20,000
<i>Your dad told me
to come and find you!!!</i>

168
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,875
<i>So we could get it back!</i>

169
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,333
<i>- I have Don's address here!
- Save it for later!</i>

170
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:32,083
<i>Here, dump your gear
and go take a shower! Go on!</i>

171
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,542
<i>Come on, it'll do you good!
Through here!</i>

172
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:38,792
<i>- Then can we-
- Later! Here's a towel!</i>

173
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,917
I'll even turn on
the light for you!

174
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:45,167
<i>Soap's on the left,
toothpaste on the right.</i>

175
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,333
<i>And don’t jerk off
all over the floor.</i>

176
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,750
<i>Hi, is that you, Muay?</i>

177
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:56,708
<i>Meet me at the Khaosan Road
fight club.</i>

178
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:42,208
Still time to place a bet on Ali?

179
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:47,583
<i>All of it!</i>

180
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,917
Where's the amulet?

181
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:07,542
<i>Their pigheaded chief
refused to sell!</i>

182
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:11,583
<i>So I took Ong-Bak's head
instead, boss!</i>

183
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:15,833
<i>He's the village deity, boss!
They revere him!</i>

184
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,375
<i>You wasted your time!</i>

185
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,833
<i>It's a lousy lump of stone!</i>

186
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:27,667
<i>You're such a jerk!</i>

187
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,500
<i>Get this rock out of my sight!!!</i>

188
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,750
Before I really get mad!

189
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,542
Your boys
keep letting you down, huh?

190
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,542
<i>And now Pearl Harbour's!!!</i>

191
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:51,875
<i>Going to get the kamikaze treatment
from my boy Ali!</i>

192
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:58,667
<i>You seem very sure of that!</i>

193
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:02,833
<i>If you think your guy can win it,
up the stakes!</i>

194
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,917
<i>I have no limit!</i>

195
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,167
<i>Call me whenever, babe!</i>

196
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:02,083
<i>Next fight,
if you're still game!</i>

197
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:05,833
<i>Maybe you'd like to up the stakes!</i>

198
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,917
<i>The winner, Pearl Harbor!</i>

199
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:14,750
Bastard!

200
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:18,417
<i>Pearl have won three men!</i>

201
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:23,042
<i>- Shit!
- Who wants to be next?</i>

202
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:26,083
- Where's the villagers' money?
- What?

203
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,250
- Where's the money?
- How should I know?

204
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,917
There!

205
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,333
<i>New challenger!</i>

206
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:52,667
<i>Come on, lay your bets! 3 to 1!</i>

207
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,125
What's country boy
think he's doing?

208
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:03,292
<i>Yup, we can wave good-bye to Ting!</i>

209
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,500
<i>I'll give you 10 to 1!!!</i>

210
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:10,833
<i>But perhaps
you'd better not risk it!</i>

211
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:14,667
<i>Okay, let's up the ante
to one million!</i>

212
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,208
<i>I'm in!</i>

213
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:20,125
<i>I don't want to fight!
I just want my cash!</i>

214
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,583
<i>No sweat, kid, leave it to me!</i>

215
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,333
Fight!

216
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,833
We've got a new champion tonight...

217
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:52,458
<i>- What's your name?
- Ting from Nong Pradu!</i>

218
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,958
Ting, the Pradu Legend!

219
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:06,000
Prize for the winner!

220
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:14,292
<i>No, I just want my money back!</i>

221
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:17,625
What an idiot!

222
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:30,667
Why didn't you
take the dough, lunkhead?

223
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:34,833
<i>If you want to fight again,
let me know!</i>

224
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:37,708
<i>You're good,
you can beat anyone!</i>

225
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,833
<i>I see us getting very rich!</i>

226
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:42,042
<i>I don't box for money!</i>

227
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:46,000
What got into you,
stealing the villagers' money?

228
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,917
<i>Not stealing, investing!</i>

229
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:50,542
<i>When we're rich,
I'll help you find Ong-Bak!</i>

230
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,625
<i>- Really?
- You bet!</i>

231
00:25:57,833 --> 00:26:00,583
<i>Here's Don's address!
Can you take me?</i>

232
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:03,333
<i>Hold on to it,
I'll take you later!</i>

233
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:06,167
Meantime, lend me some!

234
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,333
<i>I'll pay you back when I win!
Then I'll take you!</i>

235
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,250
Trust me!

236
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:21,125
Okay, get lost!
I asked you nicely, damn it!

237
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:54,875
<i>About the loan
you asked for to set up a business...</i>

238
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
<i>I can't help you...</i>

239
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:00,000
<i>because of the drought
in the village.</i>

240
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:03,333
<i>Worse than that,
Don stole Ong-Bak's head.</i>

241
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:07,375
<i>I want you to help Ting
to get it back...</i>

242
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
<i>to change our fortune.</i>

243
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:11,583
Numskulls!

244
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:44,625
<i>The well's nearly dry!
What will we do for water?</i>

245
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:55,167
<i>Please, God,
help them find Ong-Bak!</i>

246
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:04,333
How's business?

247
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:09,375
You got your losing face on?

248
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,000
<i>- Hi, Lao!
- Hi, George!</i>

249
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,667
Where you been all this time?

250
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,750
<i>- Working with friends!
- I'm short of staff! Can you help out?</i>

251
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:23,417
<i>- Sorry, I'm busy!
- Get round here!</i>

252
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:25,333
<i>- Another time.
- Now!</i>

253
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:27,500
Move it!

254
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,583
<i>That's better!</i>

255
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,667
<i>Get lost, you can't deal!</i>

256
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,708
<i>Sir, at your age!!!</i>

257
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:41,833
<i>You should be home
looking after the kids!</i>

258
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:48,708
<i>- What are you staring at, asshole?
- Get out!</i>

259
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:53,333
<i>And get the dye out of your hair!
Don't copy off me!</i>

260
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:00,375
<i>Let's see your money!</i>

261
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,292
<i>If you lose don't blame me!</i>

262
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,000
Double nine!

263
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:16,708
<i>Deal me in!</i>

264
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:20,833
<i>- You got money?
- 3,000 baht! Enough for you?</i>

265
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:25,208
<i>Let her play, if she wants to lose!
We'll clean her out!</i>

266
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:35,667
Double eight!

267
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,708
<i>Rake in the dough, George.</i>

268
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:42,833
<i>Wait! I have double nine!
Pay up!</i>

269
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,542
<i>- The house has a six. Shit.
- I have a nine!</i>

270
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:04,667
<i>- Triple eight!
- Nine points for me!</i>

271
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:09,167
<i>What's happening with the cards?</i>

272
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,958
<i>She's on a hot streak!</i>

273
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:16,333
<i>She just got lucky, that's all, boss.</i>

274
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:18,750
<i>I got a nine!</i>

275
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:23,458
<i>- Eight points again!
- Nine points again!!</i>

276
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:25,042
Fuck!

277
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,250
<i>I win again! Pay up!</i>

278
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:32,792
Eight for me!

279
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:37,083
<i>Nine for me again!! You lose!!</i>

280
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:45,250
<i>Leave your cards on the table!</i>

281
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:49,292
<i>I want to see
if the chick's cheating!</i>

282
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,292
<i>She got nine points 15 times!!!</i>

283
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:56,625
<i>And I lost every round!
If you get a nine this time!!!</i>

284
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,167
<i>It means
you're definitely cheating!!!</i>

285
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,458
You little devil!

286
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,833
<i>Let's see!!!</i>

287
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:10,833
I've got eight again!

288
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:16,000
<i>If you get nine points,
you'd better watch out!</i>

289
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:19,833
<i>You see, boss, she got four points.</i>

290
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,375
<i>- Look!!
- I don't believe it!</i>

291
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,542
<i>She has hidden cards!
I'll search her!</i>

292
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,875
<i>Calm down. I'll handle it.</i>

293
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,750
<i>Frisk her, George!</i>

294
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:34,333
<i>- You hiding cards?
- No way!</i>

295
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:37,833
<i>- Let's see!
- Where? I've no pockets!</i>

296
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:39,917
<i>- I'll find 'em!
- It's okay!</i>

297
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:42,250
C'mon, sweets, get lost!

298
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:46,708
<i>- No! Frisk her all over!
- I have! Go on, scram!</i>

299
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:49,792
And don't let me
see here you again!

300
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,833
<i>You're wasting
our valuable time!</i>

301
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:55,083
<i>Okay, let's fleece these suckers!</i>

302
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:57,833
<i>There's nobody left to fleece!!</i>

303
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,625
<i>- She cleaned them out!
- Don't blame me!</i>

304
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:04,417
<i>8,000 in all.
3,000 for you, for college...</i>

305
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:08,292
<i>- What? Only 3,000?
- You don't need more!</i>

306
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:13,208
<i>- Why's that all I get?
- Take it and don't spend it all!</i>

307
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:16,250
<i>- Give me 4,000!
- No! 3,000's fine!</i>

308
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,333
<i>- That won't pay my college fees!
- Hey!</i>

309
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:24,333
<i>- You in the money?
- Not that shithead again!</i>

310
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:26,750
<i>- Give me that!
- It's mine!</i>

311
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:29,458
<i>It's a loan! I'll pay you back!</i>

312
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:34,833
<i>What a coincidence!
I was on my way over!</i>

313
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:37,083
- Hey, that's mine!
- What?

314
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,042
<i>There's 8,000! The rest later!</i>

315
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:45,042
<i>Don't look so sour-faced!</i>

316
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:47,875
<i>Screw the rest of the money!</i>

317
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,833
<i>You two ripped me off!
I hate that!</i>

318
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:54,667
Get up!

319
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,083
I can't fight all of you!

320
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:06,958
<i>I'm not fighting!</i>

321
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,417
Rip me off, would you?

322
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,417
Who are you?

323
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,792
Stay out of this, dipshit!

324
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,167
<i>I'll get you for this!</i>

325
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:43,750
<i>I owe you one, Ting!</i>

326
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:45,917
<i>I owe you one, Ting!</i>

327
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:48,833
<i>I'll take you to find Ong-Bak!</i>

328
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,375
Will you box for me
just once more?

329
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,292
Listen to me!

330
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:00,042
<i>You saw the trouble I was in!</i>

331
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,458
<i>If I don't pay up, I'm dead!</i>

332
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:05,333
<i>Help me! Fight once more!
Last time! Please...</i>

333
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,625
<i>Lay off him!</i>

334
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:11,833
<i>So don't help me!
Screw your stupid village!</i>

335
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,875
<i>Sending one guy
against a whole gang...</i>

336
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:16,958
to recover Ong-Bak?

337
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:21,250
Crazy! If Ong-Bak's so great,
why's he headless?

338
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,417
He's just a bit of rock!

339
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,458
Ting! What are you doing?

340
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:32,333
- You're cousins, cut it out!
- He hit me!

341
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:35,583
<i>Forget it!
Look who's come for you!</i>

342
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,333
<i>Peng!!</i>

343
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:41,500
One beating not enough?

344
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:44,000
<i>You're a glutton
for punishment!</i>

<i>Thai boxing's good on stage!
You should try freestyle!</i>

391
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:35,167
<i>You won't beat me!!
Thai people are not strong enough.</i>

392
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,417
<i>That's why Thai women come
to my country and become hookers!</i>

393
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:41,167
Come on! I'll show you!

394
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:45,250

<i>You don't fight me now,
this guy will die!</i>

403
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:37,708
- Have you seen Don?
- No!

404
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:41,917
<i>But I see a Thai getting beaten up!
You're a coward!</i>

405
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,917
Come on!

406
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:56,250
<i>You just going to watch?
If you do, he's dead!</i>

407
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:58,583
<i>Come on!</i>

408
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:02,792

Come on! Come on!

410
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:10,250
<i>Help him or I won't help you
find Ong-Bak!</i>

411
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:14,333
You can discuss it later,
but that guy needs help now!

412
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:25,417
<i>- I will kill him!
- No!</i>

413
00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:51,208

00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:06,083
I'll give you 2 to 1?

417
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:08,958
<i>Okay, I bet three million!</i>

418
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:11,833
Fight!

Fight me now? Come on!
Fuck Muay Thai!

420
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:22,667
Foot strokes face!

421
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:36,792
<i>Hanuman visits Lanka!</i>

422
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,708
<i>If he wins
give me the prize money!</i>

423
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:45,667
I know that!

424
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:32,833
Way to go! You're the best!

425
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,292
<i>Enough! You won't
get it back today!</i>

426
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:25,167
<i>The next fight...</i>

427
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:02,083
Well done! Muay,
where's the moneybag?

428
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:05,792
<i>- What for?
- I'll only bet half of it!</i>

429
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:08,125
<i>- Sure?
- Trust me!</i>

430
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:56,083
<i>Another challenger?
This time, no odds!</i>

431
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:59,417
<i>Sure, 10 million on the table!</i>

432
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:01,667
<i>No problem!</i>

433
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:12,792
Oh, God! Mad Dog!

434
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,833
Can you take it?

435
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:33,333
Leave me alone!

436
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,958
Let go of me!

437
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:23,167
<i>You disappoint me!</i>

438
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:55,333
<i>You're the best, Ting!
I told you, Muay!!!</i>

439
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:58,083
<i>We should have bet it all!</i>

440
00:53:58,208 --> 00:54:01,958
Well then? I'm filthy rich!

441
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,708
<i>Muay, pick it up!</i>

442
00:54:58,792 --> 00:55:02,333
<i>Let's call it a day now! No more!</i>

443
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:12,667
<i>Ting, at this rate,
we're gonna make a fortune!</i>

444
00:55:12,792 --> 00:55:16,333
<i>- This is so cool.
- Don!</i>

445
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:20,917
The pigs!

446
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:23,917
Music!

447
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:29,167
<i>C'mon, get in!!</i>

448
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:45,667
<i>I have to deliver this week.</i>

449
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:48,000
<i>Tell your guys
to box up the goods.</i>

450
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:51,792
<i>- And no fuckups, okay?
- Yes, boss!</i>

451
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:54,833
How do you know the hick?

452
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:00,958
How are we going to find Don?

453
00:56:01,042 --> 00:56:03,292
<i>Eat first! Eat!</i>

454
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:05,875
<i>Don't worry! We'll find him!</i>

455
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:10,500
<i>Around here, everybody knows him!
Eat up!</i>

456
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:13,875
<i>Muay, come with me tomorrow!</i>

457
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
<i>We may have a way
to make some cash!</i>

458
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:19,167
<i>I have an exam tomorrow!</i>

459
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,833
<i>An exam?
You never go to college!</i>

460
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:24,875
Are you screwing the teacher?

461
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:26,292
Come again?

462
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:28,458
<i>Just kidding, a little joke!</i>

463
00:56:28,542 --> 00:56:32,000
<i>You're a good student! Eat!</i>

464
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:39,333
<i>Thanks for agreeing to help me.</i>

465
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:41,500
<i>- Forget it!
- Your dad will be glad!</i>

466
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:47,417
<i>You owe me
three months' rent! Well?</i>

467
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:52,500
<i>Give me another three days, okay?
I'll have your money then!</i>

468
00:56:52,625 --> 00:56:58,042
<i>You always say that!
I want it today or you're out!</i>

469
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:01,042
<i>- Take this ring instead!
- Okay, then!</i>

470
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:04,708
<i>You have another week to pay up!</i>

471
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:10,208
<i>If you don't,
you clear out of my apartment!</i>

472
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,083
<i>I want you to come home with Ting.</i>

473
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:47,208
<i>Don't worry about the money...</i>

474
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,958
<i>or about getting ordained.</i>

475
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:55,375
<i>Just come and visit now and again.
I'm thinking of you.</i>

476
00:58:46,042 --> 00:58:50,417
It's not as good as with your ex?

477
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:55,875
Fuck it!

478
00:58:59,042 --> 00:59:01,375
<i>Don!!!</i>

479
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:03,833
<i>I won't push
your drugs anymore!</i>

480
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,500
Why not?

481
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:17,917
<i>I want to kick it!</i>

482
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:27,292
You want to kick it?

483
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,250
<i>You want to clean up?
Come here!</i>

484
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:38,583
Think you can quit
just like that?

485
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,792
<i>If you think you can, go ahead!</i>

486
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:45,417
<i>Go right ahead!</i>

487
01:00:08,917 --> 01:00:10,875
Who's that?

488
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:32,375
Ngek! Ngek!

489
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:34,917
<i>Ngek!! Ngek!!</i>

490
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:37,125
<i>- Where's Ong-Bak?
- I don't know.</i>

491
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:39,417
<i>- You took it!
- I said I don't know!</i>

492
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:42,792
Ting!

493
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:49,875
Ngek!

494
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:02,667
Get that guy!

495
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:12,875
<i>Call an ambulance now!
Room 212, someone's dying!</i>

496
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:27,625
<i>Ting, come on!! Get in.</i>

497
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,792
Son of a bitch!

498
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,042
<i>Ting!!</i>

499
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:22,292
Brake!

500
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:24,208
<i>Make sure you check
everything's okay.</i>

501
01:06:24,292 --> 01:06:26,333
<i>Above all!!!</i>

502
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:30,500
<i>Don't let anyone
you don't know in!</i>

503
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:33,208
The fucker never gives up!

504
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:39,167
<i>Get in!</i>

505
01:08:41,792 --> 01:08:44,417
<i>The police and the
National Heritage Department...</i>

506
01:08:44,542 --> 01:08:47,250
<i>have recovered
many stolen antiques!!!</i>

507
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:50,458
<i>Hidden at this
Chao Praya fish farm.</i>

508
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:53,375
<i>The horde is said
to be priceless...</i>

509
01:08:53,458 --> 01:08:57,207

510
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:58,458
<i>Because each piece
is a national treasure.</i>

511
01:08:58,542 --> 01:09:00,917
<i>The National Heritage
Department...</i>

<i>is making a catalog
for protective conservation.</i>

513
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:07,917
<i>We will report any developments
to this story.</i>

514
01:09:19,667 --> 01:09:22,583
<i>I told you
to stay out of trouble!</i>

515
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:26,792
<i>I didn't start it!
They were looking for Ong-Bak!</i>

516
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:30,375
What is Ong-Bak?

517
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:34,042
<i>The Buddha's head
I brought you!</i>

518
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:37,417
Dumbfuck! You want to ruin me?

519
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:39,792
<i>I lose a bet for 10 million!!!</i>

520
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:44,250
<i>And now you screw up my business
with some Buddha's head!</i>

521
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:52,833
<i>Don't be so sad!
Everyone has to die some day!</i>

522
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:56,792
<i>I'll be here for you! What the...</i>

523
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:01,750
Where are you taking us?

524
01:10:15,375 --> 01:10:17,125
<i>You don't know!!!</i>

525
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:19,458
<i>Who you're messing with!</i>

526
01:10:20,542 --> 01:10:23,667
<i>I know nothing about it!</i>

527
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:27,875
<i>It's between Ting and Don!
Honest! I don't know anything!</i>

528
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:46,667
<i>I know you're looking
for this head!</i>

529
01:10:47,917 --> 01:10:50,083
<i>You're very persistent!</i>

530
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:56,375
<i>If you want
I have a game we can play!</i>

531
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:07,000
<i>I saw Ong-Bak with my own eyes!</i>

532
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:11,000
<i>Just one rope fistfight
and he'll give him back!</i>

533
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:13,833
<i>And he'll release Muay!</i>

534
01:11:13,917 --> 01:11:17,542
What do you say?

535
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:23,292
<i>I'll do anything you ask!!!</i>

536
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:27,500
<i>To take Ong-Bak home
to our village!</i>

537
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:32,375
<i>Even if it costs me my life!</i>

538
01:11:34,542 --> 01:11:38,875
BOXING HALL THAI-BURMESE BORDER

539
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,042
Why hold this fight
on the border?

540
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:58,000
<i>Just a change of scenery!</i>

541
01:11:58,083 --> 01:12:00,458
<i>I wanted a rope fistfight!</i>

542
01:12:00,542 --> 01:12:04,375
<i>Out here, if anyone dies,
it won't be a problem!</i>

543
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:08,750
You hate the country boy
so much, you want him dead?

544
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:13,208
<i>If you're feeling lucky,
name the stakes!</i>

545
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,375
<i>You sound like a loser!</i>

546
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:10,792
<i>And now for the main event.</i>

547
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:15,708
In the east corner, Ting the Pradu Legend.

548
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:20,875
<i>Ting is an up and coming fighter,
one to watch.</i>

549
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,208
<i>In the west corner,
a Burmese boxer, Saming Sibtid...</i>

550
01:13:25,292 --> 01:13:27,708
<i>out to prove
his country's worth.</i>

551
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:30,458
<i>The stage is set. Bring it on guys!!</i>

552
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:35,500
<i>For Saming Sibtid,
this is his first bout...</i>

553
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:38,375
<i>after a long absence.
He may be rusty.</i>

554
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:40,792
<i>Saming fixes Ting with a stare.</i>

555
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:45,000
<i>Ting kicks with the left.
Then right, then left again.</i>

556
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:48,292
<i>Misses with a roundhouse.
It's gonna be a tight fight.</i>

557
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,083
<i>You wanna die, kid?</i>

558
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:13,375
<i>If you want Ong-Bak,
come with me!</i>

559
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:45,167
<i>Your reward...</i>

560
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:48,958
<i>for getting country boy
to throw the fight!</i>

561
01:16:58,917 --> 01:17:00,750
Hey, a little respect!

562
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:04,833
<i>I don't revere
lumps of stone like you do!</i>

563
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:08,708
<i>I have no respect for religion.</i>

564
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:11,875
<i>I revere only myself.</i>

565
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,583
<i>Revere me also! I am God!</i>

566
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:17,875
<i>I decide if you live or die!</i>

567
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:21,458
Bastard!

568
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:25,542
<i>You wanted Ting to lose
and he threw the fight!</i>

569
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:29,625
Now hand over Ong-Bak!
Motherfucker!

570
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:39,333
<i>That hunk of rock
cost my business 100 million!</i>

571
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:44,792
<i>Don't think I'll ever
give it back to him!</i>

572
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:47,207
<i>Remember, I am God!</i>

573
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:49,042
<i>Remember, I am God!</i>

574
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:52,958
<i>Dispose of them
and meet me at the cave!</i>

575
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:11,625
<i>Do it quietly!</i>

576
01:18:26,042 --> 01:18:28,958
<i>I told you to be discreet!</i>

577
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:47,458
You'll have the cops after us!

578
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:58,875
Hey! Get them!

579
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:55,667
Where's Ong-Bak?

580
01:21:11,542 --> 01:21:13,875
<i>Let me come!</i>

581
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,958
<i>No!</i>

582
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:18,542
<i>I won't let anyone
die for Ong-Bak!</i>

583
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:21,250
<i>If someone must, it will be me!</i>

584
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:30,792
Ting! Ting!

585
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:34,833
<i>Let me help you!</i>

586
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:40,583
<i>I never wanted it
to turn out this way!</i>

587
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:45,292
<i>Forgive me!
Let me do something for Nong Pradu!</i>

588
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:50,708
<i>Let me start the bike
for you at least!</i>

589
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:57,250
<i>I'm Humlae
of Nong Pradu village!</i>

590
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:13,458
<i>Don said that
around the other side of the mountain...</i>

591
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:15,167
<i>there's a cave.</i>

592
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:06,292
You never give up, do you?

593
01:26:13,667 --> 01:26:18,083
<i>If you put your life on the line
for this tiny head!!!</i>

594
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:20,417
What about this one?

595
01:29:21,875 --> 01:29:25,167
Humlae, are you okay?

596
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:34,792
<i>Go and rescue Ong-Bak! Hurry!</i>

597
01:29:37,667 --> 01:29:39,875
Don't worry about me!

598
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,792
Hurry!

599
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,292
<i>Be careful!</i>

600
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:48,875
<i>Last time, he threw the fight!</i>

601
01:31:42,292 --> 01:31:44,792
<i>We're almost through, boss!</i>

602
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:48,000
<i>Good! Hoist it up!</i>

603
01:35:38,667 --> 01:35:40,750
You want it?

604
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:45,750
What if I smash it to pieces?

605
01:37:08,042 --> 01:37:09,792
Humlae!

606
01:37:11,875 --> 01:37:15,000
Humlae, are you okay?

607
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:21,958
<i>Get hold of Ong-Bak!!!</i>

608
01:37:22,042 --> 01:37:25,250
<i>And take him home!</i>

609
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:27,208
George!

610
01:37:27,333 --> 01:37:30,167
Can you hear me?

611
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,792
<i>- Humlae!
- Muay...</i>

612
01:37:36,875 --> 01:37:39,625
<i>study hard!!!</i>

613
01:37:41,542 --> 01:37:43,750
<i>And find a good job!</i>

614
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:55,583
<i>Ting!!!</i>

615
01:37:55,708 --> 01:38:00,042
<i>Tell my father...</i>

616
01:38:02,125 --> 01:38:05,750
<i>I'm sorry, I won't be ordained!</i>

617
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:09,458
<i>Why do you say that?
We'll get you to a hospital!</i>

618
01:38:09,542 --> 01:38:11,250
<i>- You'll be okay!
- Humlae!</i>

619
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:19,333
George! You can't die!

620
01:38:19,417 --> 01:38:23,000
You promised to take care of me!
You can't die!

621
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:25,542
Were you lying? Don't do this!

622
01:38:25,667 --> 01:38:31,042
Wake up now! I have nobody else!
You promised!
