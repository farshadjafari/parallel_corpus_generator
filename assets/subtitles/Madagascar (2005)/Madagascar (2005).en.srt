1
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:16,566
Surprise!

2
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:24,081
Alex. Do not interrupt me
when I'm daydreaming.

3
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:26,416
When a zebra's in the zone,
leave him alone.

4
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:29,389
Come on, Marty. Just wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.

5
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,584
Hey, man, thanks.

6
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:36,560
Hey, I got something
stuck in my teeth.

7
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:39,429
It's driving me crazy.
Can you help me? Please?

8
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:41,833
You came to the right place, my friend.

9
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:44,963
Dr. Marty, D.D.S., is in the house.

10
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,068
Please hop on top of my sterilized
examination table, if you may.

11
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:54,341
- I don't see anything.
- It's on the left.

12
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,644
Oh, sorry.

13
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:58,277
Okay, just don't talk
with your mouth full.

14
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:02,890
Right here. What the heck
is this doing in there?

15
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,391
Happy birthday!

16
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,859
Aw, hey, thanks, man.

17
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:10,056
You put it in behind the tooth.
You all right.

18
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:13,191
These aren't even on the shelf yet.
Here. Check it out.

19
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:17,898
- Look at that. Ooh! Look at that.
- Look at that. It's snowing.

20
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:20,464
Ten years old, huh? A decade.

21
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,840
Double digits. The big 1-0.

22
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,640
You don't like it?

23
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:28,979
- No, no, it's great.
- You hate it.

24
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,816
I should've gotten you the Alex
alarm clock. That's the big seller.

25
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,822
No, no, no.
The present's great, really.

26
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,589
It's just that
another year's come and gone

27
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,719
and I'm still doing
the same old thing.

28
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:45,630
"Stand over here. Trot over there.
Eat some grass. Walk back over here. "

29
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,464
- I see your problem.
- Maybe I should go to law school.

30
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:51,232
You just need to break out
of that boring routine.

31
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:53,206
- How?
- Throw out the old act.

32
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:56,573
Who knows what you'll do.
Make it up as you go along.

33
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:59,307
Ad lib. Improvise. On the fly.
Boom, boom, boom.

34
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:01,645
- Really?
- You know, make it fresh.

35
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:04,116
Fresh, huh? Okay.
I could do fresh.

36
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,243
Works for me.

37
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,524
Here come the people, Marty.
I love the people.

38
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:14,323
It's fun people fun time!

39
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:18,196
Let's go, Gloria!
Up and at 'em. We're open!

40
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,258
What day is it?

41
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:22,735
It's Friday. Field trip day.

42
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:26,069
Yes, it's field trip day.
Let's get up and go...

43
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:27,868
...in ten more minutes.

44
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:30,836
Come on!

45
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:33,813
Melman, Melman, Melman!
Melman, Melman, Melman!

46
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:38,148
Wake up! Rise and shine! It's another
fabulous morning in the Big Apple.

47
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,550
Let's go.

48
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:42,613
- Not for me. I'm calling in sick.
- What?

49
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:46,684
I found another brown spot
on my shoulder. Right here. See?

50
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:48,786
Right there. You see?

51
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:51,991
Melman, you know
it's all in your head. Hm?

52
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:53,898
Let's go! Come on!

53
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:09,772
Phil! Wake up, you filthy monkey.

54
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:15,312
Oh, I'm going to be fresh.

55
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,190
Straight out the ground.
Tasty fresh! Freshalicious.

56
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,523
Ziploc fresh.

57
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:25,259
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages,

58
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,665
the Central Park Zoo
proudly presents:

59
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:29,567
Show them the cat. Who's the cat?

60
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,935
The king of New York City.

61
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:34,531
Alex the lion.

62
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,807
It's showtime.

63
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,407
Roar!

64
00:04:53,428 --> 00:04:57,194
Gather around, people.
Big show about to start.

65
00:04:57,265 --> 00:05:00,996
Check out the zebra
taking care of biz. That's right.

66
00:05:34,803 --> 00:05:36,998
Just smile and wave, boys.

67
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,936
Smile and wave.

68
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:41,202
Kowalski, progress report.

69
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,939
We're 500 feet from the main sewer line.

70
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:47,004
- And the bad news?
- We've broken our last shovel.

71
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,412
Right.

72
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:52,043
Rico, you're on litter patrol.
We need shovels.

73
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,623
And find more Popsicle sticks.
We don't want to risk another cave-in.

74
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,953
And me, skipper?

75
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:01,086
I want you to look
cute and cuddly, private.

76
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:03,528
Today we're going to blow this dump.

77
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:06,260
Come here. Come here.
Come on, penguin.

78
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,169
Yeah! You don't
see that on Animal Planet.

79
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:14,968
Ha-ha.

80
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:18,979
Well, show's over, folks.
Thanks for coming.

81
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:21,379
I hope you thought it was fresh.

82
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:22,973
I'll be here all week.

83
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:25,645
In fact, I'll be here
for my whole life.

84
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,052
Three hundred
and sixty-five days a year,

85
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:32,125
including Christmas,
Hanukkah, Halloween, Kwanzaa.

86
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:35,720
Please don't forget
to never spay or neuter your pets.

87
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:39,730
And tip your cabbie,
because he's broke.

88
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:49,574
You, quadruped.
Sprechen sie Englisch?

89
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:51,236
I sprechen.

90
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:54,475
- What continent is this?
- Manhattan.

91
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:57,484
Hoover Dam! We're still in New York.

92
00:06:57,552 --> 00:06:59,782
Abort. Dive! Dive! Dive.

93
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:02,118
Hey. You in the tux. Wait a minute.

94
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,624
What are you guys doing?

95
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,523
We're digging to Antarctica.

96
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,759
Ant-who-tica?

97
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,422
Can you keep a secret,
my monochromatic friend?

98
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:19,801
Do you ever see any penguins
running free around New York City?

99
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:24,937
Of course not. We don't belong here.
It's just not natural.

100
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:28,312
This is all some kind
of whacked-out conspiracy.

101
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:32,410
We're going to the
wide-open spaces of Antarctica.

102
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:33,920
To the wild.

103
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,390
The wild?
You could actually go there?

104
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,791
That sounds great.

105
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:46,556
Hey, hold up. Where is this place?
Tell me where it is.

106
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:50,200
You didn't see anything.

107
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
Right?

108
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:53,067
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:54,802
I'm sorry. No, sir.

110
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:59,375
For his final appearance of the day,

111
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:02,539
the king of New York City.

112
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:04,275
Alex the lion.

113
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,146
Roar!

114
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,882
Thank you. Thank you very much.

115
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,589
You guys are great. You're a
great crowd. Give yourselves a hand.

116
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,961
Thank you. Oh. Thank you.

117
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:19,761
Oh! Well. Thank you.

118
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:22,166
Oh, that's too kind. Too kind.

119
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,965
Underpants!

120
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,168
Everybody get home safe. Hey!
Check out my Web site.

121
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,835
Twenty-four hour Alex Cam.
Watch me sleep.

122
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:42,179
This is the life.

123
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:44,386
That's the spot.

124
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,290
Oh! I'm in heaven.

125
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,866
- Ooh, it's Marty's birthday.
- Just rip it open.

126
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,103
- What is it?
- Come on. Open it up. What you got?

127
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:03,473
A thermometer.

128
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,412
Thanks. I love it, Melman. I love it.

129
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:12,979
I wanted to give you something personal.
That was my first rectal thermometer.

130
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,147
- Mother...
- I'll miss that bad boy.

131
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:16,918
Get the cake. Melman, come on.

132
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,493
Happy birthday to you

133
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,497
You live in a zoo

134
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,897
You look like a monkey

135
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:29,801
And you smell like one too

136
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,004
I say.

137
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,610
Aw, well, now, you guys
are just embarrassing me.

138
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,009
And yourselves.

139
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,480
What? We worked
on that all week.

140
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:44,347
Let's go.
Let's make a wish, babycakes.

141
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:52,925
- What'd you wish for?
- Nope. Can't tell you that.

142
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,154
Come on. Tell.

143
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,560
No siree.
I'm telling you, it's bad luck.

144
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,997
You want some bad luck,
I'll blab it out.

145
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:01,900
But if you want to be safe,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

146
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,529
Would you just tell us?
What could happen?

147
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,867
Okay.

148
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,240
I wished I could go to the wild!

149
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:11,539
The wild?!

150
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:16,941
I told you it was bad luck.

151
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,651
The wild? Are you nuts?

152
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:23,815
That is the worst idea
I've ever heard.

153
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,617
It's unsanitary.

154
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,789
The penguins are going.
So why can't I?

155
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:32,389
The penguins are psychotic.

156
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:35,868
Come on. Just imagine
going back to nature.

157
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:39,930
Back to your roots.
Clean air, wide-open spaces!

158
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,475
I hear there's
wide-open spaces in Connecticut.

159
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:45,910
- Connecticut?
- You got to go over to Grand Central.

160
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,245
Then you got to take
the Metro-North train... north?

161
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:53,549
So one could take the train?
Just hypothetically.

162
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:56,522
Come on. What would
Connecticut have to offer us?

163
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:58,491
- Lyme disease.
- Thank you, Melman.

164
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,787
No, I just want...

165
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:01,795
There's none of this in the wild.

166
00:11:01,863 --> 00:11:05,264
This is a highly
refined type of food thing

167
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,164
that you do not find in the wild.

168
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:10,466
You ever thought there might
be more to life than steak, Alex?

169
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:13,405
He didn't mean that, baby.
No, no, no.

170
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:17,342
Doesn't it bother you guys
that you don't know anything

171
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,606
about life outside this zoo?

172
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:22,744
- Nuh-uh. Nope.
- Mm-mm.

173
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:26,446
Well, I mean, come on.
That's just one subject.

174
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:30,249
You got a little schmutz
right there on your...

175
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:39,255
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for the party. It was great.

176
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,561
Really.

177
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:49,536
What's eating him?

178
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,546
Maybe you should talk to him.
Go over and give him a little pep talk.

179
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:57,482
Hey, I already gave him
a snow globe. I can't top that.

180
00:11:58,286 --> 00:12:00,720
I can see where this is going.

181
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:04,420
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

182
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,995
Come on. He's your best friend.

183
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:20,063
All right, all right. Okay.

184
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:22,735
- Night, Marty.
- Night, Glo.

185
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,395
What a day.

186
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:52,132
I mean, I tell you, it just doesn't
get any better than this, you know?

187
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,569
Ooh! It just did. Even the star's out.

188
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,611
Not going to find a star
like that in the wild.

189
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:01,705
Helicopter.

190
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,347
Marty. Buddy. Listen.

191
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:11,517
Everybody has days when they think the
grass might be greener somewhere else.

192
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:12,718
Alex.

193
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,056
Look at me.

194
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:18,121
I'm ten years old.
My life is half over.

195
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:21,999
And I don't even know
if I'm black with white stripes...

196
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,128
...or white with black stripes.

197
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,038
Marty.

198
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:34,445
I'm thinking of a song.

199
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,380
Alex. Please. Not now.

200
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,318
Oh, yes. It's a wonderful song.
I think you're familiar with it.

201
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,549
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.
No, no, no.

202
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,149
I'm not listening.

203
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,793
Start spreadin' the news

204
00:13:49,864 --> 00:13:50,956
I don't know you.

205
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:53,728
I'm leaving today

206
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:58,500
- We are a great big part of it
- He's funny. Who is that?

207
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:02,069
Come on. You know
you know the words.

208
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:04,236
Two little words.

209
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:05,506
New York.

210
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,206
New York

211
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:10,409
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Hey, I'm sleeping here!

212
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,315
We're not all nocturnal, you know!

213
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:14,946
I'll knock your "turnal" right off, pal.

214
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,252
Yeah, you and what army, stripes?

215
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:20,192
You mess with him,
you mess with me, Howard.

216
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:23,924
- You're a bigmouth lion.
- See? Mr. Grumpy Stripes.

217
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:26,296
We make a great team, the two of us.

218
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:29,029
We sure do. No doubt about it.

219
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:32,698
So, what are you going to do? Go
running off to the wild by yourself?

220
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:33,797
- No.
- Good.

221
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,501
You and me. Let's go.

222
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:36,702
- What?
- The wild.

223
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:39,075
Come on. You and me together.

224
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:42,582
It's a straight shot
down Fifth Avenue to Grand Central.

225
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,641
We'll grab a train, we'll head north.

226
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:47,381
We can be back by morning.
No one will ever know.

227
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:49,685
You're joking. Right?

228
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,259
Yeah. I'm joking. Of course
I'm joking. Give me a break.

229
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:58,992
Like we're going to get a train.

230
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:03,298
Don't do that. You really
had me worried there.

231
00:15:03,371 --> 00:15:07,330
Oh, well. I guess I'll hit the sack.

232
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,969
Yeah, me too. I'll need
to rest my voice for tomorrow.

233
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:14,710
It's Seniors' Day, you know.
Have to roar extra loud.

234
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:17,615
Give them a little jolt. You know?

235
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,820
Good night, Ally Al.

236
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:33,429
They forgot to turn off
the ambience again.

237
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:35,594
Don't worry. It's cool.

238
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,038
You know, I got it.

239
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,870
Much better.

240
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:12,237
Come on, now, baby.

241
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:14,399
My little filet.

242
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:17,706
My little filet mignon
with a little fat around the edges.

243
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:21,680
I like that. I like
a little fat on my steak.

244
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:26,049
My sweet, juicy steak.
You are a rare delicacy.

245
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,850
Alex. Alex. Alex!

246
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:30,220
What? What?

247
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,417
You suck your thumb?

248
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,385
What is it, Melman?

249
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:36,362
You know how I have
that bladder infection

250
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,295
and I have to get up
every two hours?

251
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:42,734
I got up to pee and looked over at
Marty's pen, which I usually don't do.

252
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:44,737
I don't know why, but I did. And...

253
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:46,295
What? What's going on?

254
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,170
It's Marty. He's gone.

255
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:50,904
Gone! What do you mean, "gone"?

256
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:53,640
How long has he been working on this?

257
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:54,976
Marty!

258
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,414
Marty!

259
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:58,213
He wouldn't fit down there.

260
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,048
Marty? Marty! Marty!

261
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,714
This doesn't make any sense.
Where would he go?

262
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:07,286
- Connecticut!
- He wouldn't.

263
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:10,330
Oh, no! What are we going to do?

264
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,888
I mean, we got to call somebody!

265
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:19,605
Hello? Get me Missing Animals.
And hurry.

266
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:23,404
We've got a lost zebra probably on
the way to Connecticut, and we need...

267
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,577
- Hello? Hello?
- Wait a second.

268
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:31,140
- We can't call the people.
- What the...?

269
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,347
They'll be really mad.

270
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:38,118
It'll get Marty transferred for good.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

271
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:39,625
Mm-hm, I know that's right.

272
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:42,253
We got to go after him.
He's not thinking straight.

273
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,298
Let's stop him from making
the biggest mistake of his life.

274
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:50,497
He's probably out there
lost and cold, confused.

275
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:53,167
Poor little guy.

276
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,320
Come on.

277
00:18:16,397 --> 00:18:18,865
One of us should wait here
in case he comes back.

278
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:22,164
Not now. This is an intervention.
We all got to go.

279
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,397
What's the fastest way
to Grand Central?

280
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,496
- You should take Lexington.
- Melman!

281
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:30,135
- Okay. "We. " We should take Lexington.
- What about Park?

282
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,804
No, Park goes two ways.
You can't time the lights.

283
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:37,812
I heard Tom Wolfe
is speaking at Lincoln Center.

284
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,683
Well, of course we're
going to throw poo at him.

285
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,729
We should've taken Park.

286
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,928
You sure this is the fastest way
to Grand Central Station?

287
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:58,096
I don't know!
That's what Melman said.

288
00:18:58,172 --> 00:18:59,730
Hey. Hey, you, guys.

289
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:03,538
That room has some nifty little
sinks you can wash up in, and look!

290
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:05,306
Free mints!

291
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,812
This isn't a field trip.

292
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,407
This is an urgent mission to save
Marty from throwing his life away.

293
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,974
Now, where's the train?

294
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,747
Here it comes.

295
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,691
What did Marty say to you?
I asked you to talk to him.

296
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:24,322
I did! I did! I don't understand.
He said, "Let's go. "

297
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:27,390
I said, "Are you crazy?"
He says, "I'm ten years old. "

298
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:31,268
And he has black-and-white stripes,
and so then we sang and...

299
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,077
What you got to do is go
straight back down West 42nd.

300
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:42,342
It's on your left after Vanderbilt.

301
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,681
If you hit the Chrysler Building,
you've gone too far.

302
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:47,277
Thanks a lot, officer.

303
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:51,491
Hey! Wait for the light.

304
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,583
Freak.

305
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:56,391
- Did you say "zebra"?
- That's right. A zebra.

306
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:57,896
Right in front of me.

307
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,489
- Can I shoot it?
- Negative.

308
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:02,161
Then I'm going to need some backup.

309
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:17,047
- Aw! Knicks lost again.
- What are you going to do.

310
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:20,575
Did that say "Grand Central
Station" or "my aunt's constipation"?

311
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:21,643
This is it.

312
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,158
Grand Central Station.

313
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,662
It's grand and it's central.

314
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:51,240
Move aside. We have an emergency here.
This is an emergency situation.

315
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:55,186
Hey, hey. Just chill out.
It's not that big of an emergency.

316
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,688
Upstairs, downstairs.

317
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,688
How do you like that?

318
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:03,427
Lady! What is wrong with you?

319
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:06,589
Ow! Get a grip on yourselves, people.

320
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,157
You're a bad kitty.

321
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,872
Dagnabbit! I missed the express.

322
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,841
Looks like I'll have
to take the Stamford local.

323
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:17,672
I got him! I've got him!

324
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:18,837
He's got him!

325
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:21,142
He's got him!
He's got him! He's got...

326
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:22,648
I got something for you!

327
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:27,749
I'm okay. I'm okay.

328
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,289
Whoa! What are
you guys doing here?

329
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:34,123
- I am so glad we found you.
- We were so worried about you.

330
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:37,595
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look at me. I'm fine.

331
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,724
You're fine? Oh, he's fine. Oh, great.

332
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:43,531
You hear that? Marty's fine.
That's good to know.

333
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,231
Because I was wondering...

334
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:48,365
How could you do this to us?
I thought we were your friends!

335
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,706
What's the big deal?
I was coming back.

336
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:52,905
Don't ever do this again.
Do you hear me?

337
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,710
- Do you hear him?
- Guys, we're running out of time.

338
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:57,648
Oh, Melman, you broke their clock?

339
00:21:57,718 --> 00:22:01,154
...do this again! Don't you ever,
ever do this again!

340
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,682
Come here.

341
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:11,559
We've been ratted out, boys.

342
00:22:11,632 --> 00:22:13,156
Hold your fire!

343
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,202
Cute and cuddly, boys.
Cute and cuddly.

344
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,513
If you have any poo, fling it now.

345
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,751
It's the Man.

346
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:35,948
Good evening, officers.

347
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:38,184
No. No. No. You don't talk now. Okay?

348
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:40,818
You're not good with the
"putting words together

349
00:22:40,894 --> 00:22:43,624
and their coming out good" thing.
You keep it "shh. "

350
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:47,189
Hey! How you doing?
You know what? Everything's cool.

351
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:51,135
We just had a little situation here.
Little internal situation.

352
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:54,174
My friend went a little crazy.
Happens to everybody.

353
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:57,301
The city gets to us all.
Went a little cuckoo in the head.

354
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,311
Don't be calling me
cuckoo in the head.

355
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:03,247
Just shush! I will handle this.

356
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:04,579
Oh! I got him!

357
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,585
Go, go, go! Right here, please.

358
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:08,746
Would you give a guy a break?

359
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:14,420
We'll take my little friend home and
forget this ever happened. All right?

360
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,895
No harm, no foul, right?

361
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:22,368
Hey, it's cool. It's me,
Alex the lion. From the zoo.

362
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:28,707
What's the matter with them?

363
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:42,048
I feel really, really weird.

364
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:45,591
I love you guys.

365
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:49,391
I love you so much.

366
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:12,884
Last night's dramatic incident
in Grand Central

367
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:16,820
is an example of what animal rights
wackos have been shouting for years:

368
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,915
Animals clearly
don't belong in captivity.

369
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:22,985
They are to be sent back
to their natural habitat,

370
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:26,554
where they will live their lives
in the freedom they desire.

371
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,625
- Hey. Little help?
- He's awake! He's awake!

372
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,526
Do something!

373
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,102
Oh, man.

374
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,509
Oh, my head.

375
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:51,488
What the...?

376
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,991
Wait. Where? What?

377
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:58,491
I'm in a box! Oh, no.
No, no! Not the box.

378
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:02,159
Oh, no, they can't
transfer me. Not me!

379
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:05,227
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

380
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,272
Darkness creeping in.

381
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,604
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

382
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,803
Walls closing in around me.

383
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,172
So alone. So alone.

384
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:18,183
- Alex! Alex, are you there?
- Marty?

385
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:21,516
- Yeah! Talk to me, buddy.
- Oh, Marty! You're here!

386
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:24,420
- What's going on? You okay?
- This doesn't look good.

387
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,549
- Alex, Marty, is that you?
- Gloria!

388
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,754
- You're here too!
- I am loving the sound of your voice.

389
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:32,093
- What is going on?
- We're all in crates.

390
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:33,291
Oh, no!

391
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,000
- Sleeping just knocks me out.
- Melman!

392
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,162
Is that Melman?

393
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,967
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

394
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,873
I often doze off
while I'm getting an MRI.

395
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:46,776
- You're not getting an MRI.
- CAT scan?

396
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,713
No CAT scan. It's a transfer.
It's a zoo transfer.

397
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:53,240
Zoo transfer?! Oh, no.
No, no, I can't be transferred.

398
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,913
I have an appointment
with Dr. Goldberg at 5:00.

399
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,650
There are prescriptions
that have to be filled.

400
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,319
No other zoo could
afford my medical care.

401
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,986
And I am not going HMO.

402
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,826
Take it easy, Melman.
It's going to be okay.

403
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:10,494
- We are going to be okizay.
- No, we're not going to be okizay.

404
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,697
Now, because of you, we're ruined!

405
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:16,299
Because of me? I fail
to see how this is my fault.

406
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,776
- You're kidding, right, Marty?
- You. You ticked off the people.

407
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:22,371
You bit the hand, Marty.
You bit the hand.

408
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:26,976
"I don't know who I am. I got to go
find myself in the wild. " Oh, please.

409
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:30,284
I did not ask you
to come after me, did I?

410
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:32,017
He does have a point.

411
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,185
I did say we should stay at the zoo,
but you guys...

412
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,387
Melman, just shut it.

413
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:39,124
You suggested this idea
to him in the first place.

414
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,666
- Leave Melman out of this.
- Thank you, Gloria.

415
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,598
Besides, it's not my fault
that we were transferred.

416
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,434
Melman, shut it.
Does anybody feel nauseous?

417
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:51,341
- I feel nauseous.
- Melman, you always feel nauseous.

418
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,175
Progress report.

419
00:26:58,251 --> 00:27:01,414
It's an older code, skipper.
I can't make it out.

420
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,614
You, higher mammal.

421
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,122
Can you read?

422
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:08,354
No. Phil can read, though. Phil.

423
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:15,661
Ship to Kenya.

424
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:18,397
Wildlife preserve.

425
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,563
Africa!

426
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:22,802
Africa? That ain't going to fly. Rico.

427
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:08,046
I was the star
in the greatest city on Earth.

428
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,588
- Guys, listen.
- A king. Loved by my people.

429
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:13,352
- Let's be civil.
- And you've ruined everything!

430
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:14,518
"Loved"?

431
00:28:14,594 --> 00:28:18,826
If the people loved you, it's only
because they didn't know the real you!

432
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,958
Don't make me come up there.
I'll whoop both of y'all.

433
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,524
I thought I knew the real you!

434
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:28,506
Your black-and-white stripes, they
cancel each other out. You're nothing!

435
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:30,201
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

436
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:32,403
You're not helping the situation.

437
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:34,241
Status.

438
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:37,544
It's no good.
I don't know the codes.

439
00:28:37,617 --> 00:28:41,348
Don't give me excuses.
Give me results! Navigation.

440
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,090
All right. Let me think.

441
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,786
And shut him up!

442
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:55,264
- I did it!
- Let's get this tin can turned around.

443
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:22,988
Guys?

444
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:25,155
Oh, no.

445
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:26,491
Gloria!

446
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:27,826
Melman!

447
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,058
Marty!

448
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:31,798
Alex!

449
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:33,396
Marty?!

450
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,201
Alex!

451
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,572
Marty!

452
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,612
No, wait. Come back, Marty!

453
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,680
Don't go.

454
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:29,894
Marty?

455
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,430
Melman?

456
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,064
Gloria?

457
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,132
Marty?!

458
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,468
Melman?!

459
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,064
Gloria?!

460
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,333
Marty!

461
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:50,482
Melman! Gloria!

462
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:54,275
Hey, anyone! Hello!

463
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:01,785
Marty, Melman, Gloria.

464
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:05,920
Gloria, Melman, Marty.
Marty, Gelman, Gloria. Marty, Melman.

465
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:08,523
Morty, Morty, Gelman. Regis. Kelly.

466
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,501
Matt, Katie, Al.

467
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:18,238
Get me out of this thing.
Somebody. Hello?

468
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,372
Get me out of this thing right now!

469
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,940
Hello? Somebody?

470
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:25,278
Melman!

471
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,216
Alex? Is that you?

472
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:31,313
Melman, I got you. Hang on!
Hang on. I got you.

473
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:39,092
Melman! I got you, buddy.

474
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,330
Wait a sec, Melman.
Wait right there.

475
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:50,808
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting you out of the box.

476
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,472
- Relax.
- Alex?

477
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,075
Giraffe, corner pocket!

478
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,384
Here goes nothing!

479
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:02,580
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Hold still!

480
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,247
- Wait, Alex.
- Hold still.

481
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:06,382
- No, come on.
- Here I come!

482
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:08,324
Look! Look! Look! Look!

483
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:11,488
It's Gloria. It's Gloria!

484
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,892
Oh, hey, it is Gloria.

485
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,059
Oh, my...

486
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,534
Gloria!

487
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:27,801
Gloria!

488
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,542
Alrighty, boys, fun's over.

489
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,712
Gloria!

490
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,255
Alex!

491
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:41,617
- Marty?!
- Marty!

492
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:45,892
Yeah! All right! That's right!

493
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:49,924
Left! Left! Left. No, no,
your left! Your left! Your left!

494
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,604
Right here's good.

495
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:56,739
I don't have anything on me
right now. I'll have to get you later.

496
00:33:00,613 --> 00:33:02,080
To you too.

497
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,742
Marty!

498
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,149
Marty!

499
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,345
Alex!

500
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,790
Marty!

501
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,419
Alex!

502
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,827
Marty!

503
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:20,160
Al!

504
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:22,564
Marty!

505
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:24,728
Alex?

506
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,293
Marty!

507
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,605
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.

508
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:31,734
Martin!

509
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,539
- Hold up!
- I'm going to kill you!

510
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:36,513
- Come here! Don't run away from me!
- Calm down!

511
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:39,608
If you keep running,
I'm going to just kill you more!

512
00:33:40,553 --> 00:33:42,077
Oh, look at us.

513
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:45,521
We're all here together.
Safe and sound.

514
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,582
Yeah, here we are.

515
00:33:48,661 --> 00:33:51,528
Where exactly is "here"?

516
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:05,867
San Diego.

517
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:07,503
San Diego?

518
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,138
White sandy beaches,

519
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:13,379
cleverly simulated natural
environment, wide-open enclosures.

520
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,512
I'm telling you,
this could be the San Diego Zoo.

521
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:18,716
Complete with fake rocks.

522
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,554
Wow, that looks real.

523
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:24,858
San Diego? What could
be worse than San Diego?

524
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:28,058
I don't know.
This place is crackalacking!

525
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:31,296
Oh, I could hang here.
I could hang here.

526
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,031
- I'll kill you!
- Take it easy!

527
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,732
- Strangle you!
- Calm down.

528
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:37,901
Then bury you, dig you up,
clone you and kill your clones.

529
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:40,844
- 20-second timeout.
- I'll never talk to you again.

530
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:43,381
Now, look. We're just
going to find the people,

531
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:48,011
get checked in
and have this mess straightened out.

532
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:51,779
Oh, great.
This is just great. San Diego.

533
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:55,816
Now I'll have to compete
with Shamu and his smug little grin.

534
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,919
I can't top that. Can't top it.

535
00:34:57,997 --> 00:35:01,558
I'm ruined! I'm done.
I'm out of the business.

536
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:04,865
It's your fault, Marty!
You've ruined me.

537
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:07,599
Come on, Alex.
Do you honestly think

538
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:10,005
I intended all of this to happen?

539
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:13,010
You want me to say that I'm sorry?
Is that what you want?

540
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:14,067
Okay, I'm...

541
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,747
He just shushed me.

542
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:19,943
Marty, look, you've got
to be just a little bit more und...

543
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,421
- Don't you shush me.
- Do you hear that? Don't you hear that?

544
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:30,228
- I hear it now.
- Where there's music, there's people.

545
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,890
- Go to the head honcho.
- A sidewalk would be nice.

546
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:34,523
Yeah, what a dump.

547
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,864
They should call it
the San Di-lame-o Zoo.

548
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:42,134
First they tell you, "We got this great
open plan thing. Let animals run wild. "

549
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:45,802
Next thing, flowers in your hair,
everybody's hugging everybody.

550
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:49,245
This place kind of grows on you.
This way, guys! Come on!

551
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,320
What the...?

552
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,189
Oh, no!

553
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:19,539
Okay, let's make
a good impression on the people.

554
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,603
Smiles, everyone.
Let's get it together.

555
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:26,173
- Is that the best you can do?
- Oh, I'm not smiling. It's gas.

556
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:28,549
Well, great. Let's make gas look good.

557
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,894
- Wow!
- It's not people. It's animals.

558
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:41,330
California animals. Dude.

559
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,163
This is like a Puffy party.

560
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:47,428
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

561
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,497
- Ya like to
- Move it

562
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:53,067
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

563
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:54,908
I like to move it, move it

564
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,971
- Ya like to
- Move it

565
00:36:57,049 --> 00:37:00,416
I like to move it, move it
You like to move it, move it

566
00:37:00,486 --> 00:37:02,215
She like to move it, move it

567
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:03,811
- He like to
- Move it

568
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,483
All girls all over the world

569
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,823
Original King Julien
'pon yer case, man

570
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:13,296
I love how all the girls
that love to move their body

571
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,356
When ya move your body, ya do

572
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:18,665
Move it nice
and sweet and sassy, all right

573
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,170
What kind of zoo is this?

574
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,606
I just saw 26 blatant
health code violations.

575
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:26,735
I'm loving San Diego.
This place is off the chizain.

576
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:27,870
Twenty-seven.

577
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:31,440
Woman, physically fit, physically fit

578
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:35,419
Physically, physically, physically fit
Physically fit, Physically fit

579
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,751
We should've brought chips and dip.

580
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,051
Wait.

581
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:42,924
Where's Alex? What happened to him?
He was right behind us. Wasn't he?

582
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:46,328
I don't know where he's at,
but he's missing one heck of a party.

583
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:48,093
The fossa!

584
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:49,566
The fossa!

585
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:52,365
The fossa are attacking!
Run for your lives!

586
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:02,108
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

587
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:06,177
I hate spiderwebs.

588
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,185
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.

589
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:11,450
Thanks for waiting up.
Really appreciate it.

590
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:18,362
Hey, hi. We just got in from New York,
and we're looking for a supervisor.

591
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,763
Because we've been sitting
on that beach back there for hours,

592
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:24,268
and nobody's even bothered to show up.

593
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:27,703
I don't know how things
are normally run around here,

594
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:30,901
but there's been some sort
of major screwup, which is cool.

595
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:34,844
So if you could point us towards
the administrative offices, we'll...

596
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:35,902
Well, howdy-do.

597
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:45,488
Spider! Spider! Spider on my back!

598
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:48,651
Maurice, did you see that?

599
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,957
He scared the fossa away.

600
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,098
Come on, Gloria. Get it.

601
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,060
Get it! Get it! Get it!

602
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:59,763
- That's it! Smack it!
- Get it, get it!

603
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,999
Whip it! Whip it good!
Where'd it go?

604
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:06,272
King Julien, what are they?
What are they?!

605
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:11,305
They are aliens. Savage aliens
from the savage future.

606
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:15,843
They've come to kill us. And take
our women. And our precious metals.

607
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:20,621
Get up, Mort. Do not
be near the king's feet, okay?

608
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:25,229
We're hiding. Be quiet,
everyone. Including me.

609
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:27,026
Who's making that noise?

610
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,293
Oh, it's me again.

611
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,597
There it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria!

612
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:33,968
- Enough! Enough with the stick.
- I think she got it.

613
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,473
Is it still on me? I hate spiders.

614
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:38,706
It's okay. It's gone.

615
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:41,337
They are savages.

616
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:42,641
Tonight we die.

617
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,808
The feet. I told you...
I told you to... I told every...

618
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,784
Didn't I tell him about the feet?

619
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,014
He did tell you about the feet.

620
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:55,517
- Wait. I have a plan.
- Really?

621
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:57,960
I have devised a cunning test

622
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,761
to see whether
these are savage killers.

623
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:09,336
Hi there.

624
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:13,902
You let me handle it.
Alex handles it. Marty does nothing.

625
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,740
Hi there.

626
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:25,887
Oh, jeez. Sorry.

627
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:30,122
- Oh, Alex, what'd you do?
- Stop. Stop. It's okay. It's okay.

628
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:33,858
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion.
Oh, jeez!

629
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:40,063
- Aw, Alex!
- Oh, you poor little baby.

630
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,766
Did that big mean lion scare you?

631
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:47,278
He did? He's a big,
bad old puddy tat, isn't he?

632
00:40:47,346 --> 00:40:50,509
Come on. Mama'll hold you.
Aww, look at you.

633
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:52,880
They are so cute
from a reasonable distance.

634
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:57,388
Aren't you the sweetest little thing.
I just want to dunk him in my coffee.

635
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,357
They're just a bunch of pansies.

636
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:01,756
I don't know.

637
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:04,728
There's something
about that one with the crazy hairdo

638
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,923
that I find suspicious.

639
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:08,557
Nonsense, Maurice.

640
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:12,695
Come on, everybody.
Let's go and meet the pansies!

641
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:27,877
Presenting your royal highness,
our illustrious King Julien XIII,

642
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:31,582
self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs,
et cetera. Hooray, everybody.

643
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:39,953
He's got style.

644
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:49,296
What is he, like,
king of the guinea pigs?

645
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,776
I think it's a squirrel.

646
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:56,007
Welcome, giant pansies.

647
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:58,845
Please feel free to bask in my glow.

648
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:01,351
- Definitely a squirrel.
- Yep. Squirrel.

649
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,754
We thank you with enormous gratitude
for chasing away the fossa.

650
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,883
- The "whossa"?
- The fossa.

651
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:11,962
They annoy us by trespassing,
interrupting our parties

652
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,964
- and ripping our limbs off.
- Good.

653
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,024
We're just trying to find out
where the people are, so...

654
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:19,229
What big teeth you have. Man!

655
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:23,570
Shame on you, Maurice. Can you not
see that you have insulted the freak?

656
00:42:24,176 --> 00:42:26,701
You must tell me,
who the heck are you?

657
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:30,874
I'm Alex. The Alex.
And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.

658
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:34,214
And just where are you giants from?

659
00:42:34,286 --> 00:42:36,379
We're from New York and...

660
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:39,150
All hail the New York giants!

661
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,488
New York giants!

662
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:46,026
Is this some sort of
inbreeding program?

663
00:42:46,098 --> 00:42:49,192
I say we just got to ask these
bozos where the people are.

664
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:52,600
Excuse me. We bozos
have the people, of course.

665
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:55,731
Hey, the bozos have the people.

666
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:59,334
Oh, well, great. Good. Phew.

667
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:00,844
They're up there.

668
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:08,713
Don't you love the people?
Not a very lively bunch, though.

669
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:09,879
Wow.

670
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:12,719
So do you have any live people?

671
00:43:13,504 --> 00:43:15,335
No. Only dead ones.

672
00:43:15,405 --> 00:43:18,374
I mean, if we had
a lot of live people here,

673
00:43:18,442 --> 00:43:22,003
it wouldn't be called
the wild, would it?

674
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,376
The wild?

675
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:26,541
Whoa. Hold up there
a second, fuzzbucket.

676
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:27,948
You mean, like,

677
00:43:28,118 --> 00:43:32,612
the "live in a mud hut, wipe
yourself with a leaf" type wild?

678
00:43:32,689 --> 00:43:35,283
- Who wipes?
- Oy vey.

679
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,088
- Oy vey!
- Oy vey, everybody!

680
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,094
Oy vey!

681
00:43:39,162 --> 00:43:41,528
Could you excuse me
for a moment?

682
00:43:45,936 --> 00:43:49,201
Get me out of here!
We got to get out of here!

683
00:43:49,439 --> 00:43:52,135
- Help!
- What are you doing?!

684
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:54,336
I'm swimming back to New York.

685
00:43:54,411 --> 00:43:57,403
I know my chances are slim,
but I have to try!

686
00:43:57,481 --> 00:44:01,042
- You can't swim!
- I said my chances are slim!

687
00:44:01,118 --> 00:44:05,953
Nature! It's all over me!
Get it off! I can't see! I can't see!

688
00:44:07,658 --> 00:44:09,558
I can see!

689
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:13,860
Look. There's obviously
just been a little mistake.

690
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:16,491
The people didn't
dump us here on purpose.

691
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:20,765
As soon as they realize what happened,
they'll come looking for us, right?

692
00:44:20,837 --> 00:44:21,963
Yeah, right.

693
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:26,066
I don't know the words
But we're born free

694
00:44:26,143 --> 00:44:29,704
You know something?
I bet they're already on their way.

695
00:44:36,019 --> 00:44:40,581
Well, boys, it's going
to be ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

696
00:44:43,627 --> 00:44:45,060
Rico.

697
00:44:47,798 --> 00:44:51,859
Well, since I'm doomed
to die on this forsaken island,

698
00:44:51,935 --> 00:44:54,233
I, Melman Mankiewicz,

699
00:44:54,304 --> 00:44:57,671
being of sound mind
and unsound body,

700
00:44:57,741 --> 00:45:01,939
have divided my estate
equally among the three of you.

701
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,440
Sorry, Alex.

702
00:45:04,514 --> 00:45:09,178
Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman.
Outdoor plumbing.

703
00:45:09,252 --> 00:45:11,152
No, it's not a latrine.

704
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:15,487
It's a grave. You sent Melman
to his grave. Are you happy?

705
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:16,890
Aw, come on.

706
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,396
This isn't the end.
This is a whole new beginning.

707
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:22,728
This could be the best that's happened.

708
00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:24,824
No. No. No. No.

709
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:29,395
No. No. No. No. No. No. This is not
the best thing that's happened to us.

710
00:45:29,473 --> 00:45:33,375
You abused the power of the birthday
wish and brought bad luck on all of us.

711
00:45:33,443 --> 00:45:36,037
Why'd you tell your wish?
You're not supposed to.

712
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:38,741
I didn't want to tell you. Remember?

713
00:45:38,815 --> 00:45:42,307
- You guys made me tell you.
- Oh, okay.

714
00:45:42,386 --> 00:45:46,049
Besides, this isn't bad luck.
This is good luck.

715
00:45:46,123 --> 00:45:48,956
Look around. There's no fences,
no schedules.

716
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:51,494
This place is beautiful.
Baby, we were born...

717
00:45:51,561 --> 00:45:54,086
Okay. Okay. I've had enough of this.

718
00:45:54,164 --> 00:45:59,101
This is your side of the island,
and this is our side of the island.

719
00:45:59,169 --> 00:46:01,865
That is the bad side,
where you can prance and skip

720
00:46:01,938 --> 00:46:05,430
like a magical pixie horse
and do whatever the heck you want.

721
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:09,468
This is the good side for those who
love New York and care about going home.

722
00:46:09,546 --> 00:46:12,310
- Come on.
- No, no. Back! Back!

723
00:46:12,382 --> 00:46:14,145
You know what? This isn't good.

724
00:46:14,217 --> 00:46:18,551
Okay! You all have your side,
and I'll have mine.

725
00:46:18,622 --> 00:46:21,489
And if you need me,
I'll be over here,

726
00:46:21,558 --> 00:46:25,494
on the fun side of the island,
having a good old time.

727
00:46:25,562 --> 00:46:27,086
This is the fun side,

728
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:30,463
where we'll have a great time
surviving until we go home.

729
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:33,264
- A yabbadabbado old time!
- This side's the best.

730
00:46:33,336 --> 00:46:36,863
That side stinks! You're on
the Jersey side of this cesspool!

731
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,170
- Wilma!
- Now what do we do?

732
00:46:39,242 --> 00:46:41,676
Don't worry. I have
a plan to get us rescued.

733
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:47,907
Can't wait to see the look
on Marty's face when he sees this.

734
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:54,813
Just look at him.
He's helpless without us.

735
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:05,962
Shut up, Spalding.

736
00:47:11,074 --> 00:47:14,134
I've been standing
here for hours, man.

737
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:16,873
How long do I have
to pose like this?

738
00:47:17,647 --> 00:47:20,081
She is finito.

739
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:24,785
I defy any rescue boat
within a million miles

740
00:47:24,855 --> 00:47:26,914
to miss this baby.

741
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:31,188
When the moment is right,
we will ignite the beacon of liberty

742
00:47:31,261 --> 00:47:34,992
and be rescued
from this awful nightmare!

743
00:47:35,065 --> 00:47:38,057
What do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

744
00:47:38,135 --> 00:47:41,161
- How's the liberty fire going, Melman?
- Great. Idiot.

745
00:47:41,238 --> 00:47:42,728
I heard that.

746
00:47:42,806 --> 00:47:45,400
Why can't we just borrow
some of Marty's fire?

747
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:50,703
That's wild fire. We're not
using wild fire on Lady Liberty.

748
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:53,648
- Now, rub, Melman.
- I've been doing...

749
00:47:53,717 --> 00:47:58,313
I can't. I can't.
I can't do it. I ju... I can't do it!

750
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:00,781
Fire.

751
00:48:01,992 --> 00:48:02,981
Fire.

752
00:48:04,561 --> 00:48:06,722
Fire! Fire!

753
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,860
Oh, my

754
00:48:12,435 --> 00:48:13,527
Fire!

755
00:48:13,603 --> 00:48:15,468
Not yet! No, no! No!

756
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:17,029
Fire!

757
00:48:17,107 --> 00:48:18,540
Melman, hold still!

758
00:48:19,476 --> 00:48:21,273
Jump! Alex, jump!

759
00:48:21,344 --> 00:48:23,608
Don't worry,
cats always land on their...

760
00:48:24,614 --> 00:48:27,481
Face? Man,
what kind of cat are you?

761
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:38,059
You maniac!

762
00:48:38,495 --> 00:48:40,622
You burned it up!

763
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:42,962
Darn you!

764
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:45,900
Darn you all to heck!

765
00:48:46,303 --> 00:48:48,464
Can we go to the fun side now?

766
00:48:49,773 --> 00:48:52,867
Everybody, calm down.
Come on. Into your chairs.

767
00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:55,741
Everybody, calm down.
Let go of his tail.

768
00:48:55,812 --> 00:48:58,280
Separate those two,
would you, please?

769
00:48:58,348 --> 00:49:00,111
You here, you there. Everyone...

770
00:49:00,784 --> 00:49:03,685
Calm down, people, okay?

771
00:49:03,753 --> 00:49:08,019
Now, presenting your royal highness,
the illustrious blah, blah, blah.

772
00:49:08,091 --> 00:49:11,254
You know, et cetera, et cetera.
Hooray. Let's go.

773
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:12,920
Now, everybody,

774
00:49:12,996 --> 00:49:17,695
we all have great curiosity
about our guests, the New York giants.

775
00:49:17,767 --> 00:49:19,667
- Yes, Willie?
- I like them.

776
00:49:19,736 --> 00:49:23,695
I like them. I liked them first.
Before I even met them I liked them.

777
00:49:23,773 --> 00:49:27,539
I liked them right away. You hate
them compared to how much I like them.

778
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:29,875
Oh, shut up. You're so annoying!

779
00:49:31,014 --> 00:49:34,245
Now, for as long
as we can remember,

780
00:49:34,317 --> 00:49:39,118
we have been attacked
and eaten by the dreaded fossa.

781
00:49:39,189 --> 00:49:41,885
The fossa! The fossa are attacking!

782
00:49:45,362 --> 00:49:47,853
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!

783
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:49,558
Please. Maurice.

784
00:49:50,634 --> 00:49:52,397
Quiet!

785
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:56,633
Come on, y'all. They're not
attacking us this very instant.

786
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:01,541
So my genius plan is this:

787
00:50:01,611 --> 00:50:04,011
We will make the New York giants

788
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,981
our friends and keep them close.

789
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:10,349
Then, with Mr. Alex protecting us,

790
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,787
we will be safe
and never have to worry

791
00:50:13,857 --> 00:50:17,657
about the dreaded fossa ever again.

792
00:50:19,996 --> 00:50:23,989
I thought of that.
I thought of that. Yes. Me. I did.

793
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:26,797
Hold on, everybody. Hold on.
I'm just thinking now.

794
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:29,703
I mean, does anyone
wonder why the fossa

795
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:32,367
were so scared of Mr. Alex?

796
00:50:32,442 --> 00:50:35,707
I mean,
maybe we should be scared too.

797
00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:38,839
What if Mr. Alex
is even worse than the fossa?

798
00:50:40,283 --> 00:50:43,548
I tell you, that dude just
gives me the heebiedabajeebies.

799
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:46,111
Maurice, you did not raise your hand.

800
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:49,920
Therefore, your heinous comment
will be stricken from the record.

801
00:50:51,628 --> 00:50:54,392
Does anyone else
have the heebie-jeebies?

802
00:50:54,464 --> 00:50:56,932
No? Good. So shut up.

803
00:50:57,434 --> 00:51:00,232
When the New York giants wake up,

804
00:51:00,303 --> 00:51:05,969
we will make sure
that they wake up in paradise.

805
00:51:07,344 --> 00:51:09,642
Now, who would like a cookie?

806
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:39,139
Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria
are over there having a good time.

807
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:41,769
There's room
on the fun side for one more.

808
00:51:41,845 --> 00:51:43,472
No, thanks.

809
00:51:43,546 --> 00:51:47,710
Look, I've been thinking.
Maybe if you gave this place a chance,

810
00:51:47,784 --> 00:51:50,776
I don't know, you might
even enjoy yourself.

811
00:51:50,854 --> 00:51:54,312
Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.

812
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:56,291
I just want to go home.

813
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,453
Could you just give it a chance?
Think about it.

814
00:52:02,365 --> 00:52:05,266
It really isn't
the fun side without you.

815
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:22,711
I know. And then...

816
00:52:25,688 --> 00:52:27,781
- It's him.
- Who is it?

817
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:31,590
It's the pizza man.
Who the heck do you think it is?

818
00:52:31,928 --> 00:52:34,294
Yes? Can I help you?

819
00:52:34,998 --> 00:52:36,522
Can I come to the fun side?

820
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:40,260
Beg your pardon?

821
00:52:41,037 --> 00:52:43,267
You know, I've been kind of a jerk.

822
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:49,941
But I've been thinking
about what you said, and I'm sorry.

823
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,883
Welcome to Casa del Wild.
Take a load off.

824
00:53:00,957 --> 00:53:02,925
Hey, hey, wipe your feet.

825
00:53:07,997 --> 00:53:12,093
- Alex!
- Mi casa is su casa.

826
00:53:19,008 --> 00:53:20,498
Very impressive.

827
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:23,637
Hey, have a drink. It's on the house.

828
00:53:25,415 --> 00:53:26,677
This is seawater.

829
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:31,584
Oh, you don't swallow it. It's just
temporary till the plumbing's done.

830
00:53:31,654 --> 00:53:33,588
Hey, y'all look hungry.

831
00:53:34,324 --> 00:53:37,350
How would you like
some of nature's goodness?

832
00:53:38,461 --> 00:53:40,122
You have food?

833
00:53:40,196 --> 00:53:43,131
The Fun Side Special, coming up.

834
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,858
Seaweed on a stick.

835
00:53:46,436 --> 00:53:47,425
Seaweed?

836
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:50,931
On a stick.
Don't love it till you try it.

837
00:53:58,781 --> 00:54:00,339
That's unbelievable.

838
00:54:01,818 --> 00:54:03,877
- So good.
- Well, thanks.

839
00:54:03,953 --> 00:54:06,820
It does kind of hit the spot,
doesn't it?

840
00:54:07,824 --> 00:54:11,055
Well, maybe it could
use a little lemon.

841
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:19,331
No, it's great. It's really great.
Doesn't get any better than this.

842
00:54:19,402 --> 00:54:21,165
Oh, but it does.

843
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:23,362
Check this out.

844
00:54:28,678 --> 00:54:32,637
Wow. Would you look at that.

845
00:54:32,715 --> 00:54:37,209
It's like billions
and billions of helicopters.

846
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:39,687
It's a shooting star.
Make a wish. Quick!

847
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:42,919
Ooh! How about a thick, juicy steak?

848
00:54:42,992 --> 00:54:44,516
You know what, Alex?

849
00:54:44,594 --> 00:54:49,258
I promise you I'm going to find you
a steak tomorrow if it kills me.

850
00:54:49,332 --> 00:54:50,629
Thanks, Marty.

851
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,760
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

852
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:56,270
I think I'm going to
hit the sack too.

853
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:58,204
Sweet dreams, everyone.

854
00:55:28,504 --> 00:55:29,903
Alex.

855
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:41,611
What are you doing?

856
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:46,946
Twenty-seven, 28, 29.
Thirty black and only 29 white.

857
00:55:47,023 --> 00:55:49,856
Looks like you're black
with white stripes after all.

858
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:51,450
Dilemma solved. Good night.

859
00:56:02,171 --> 00:56:05,698
You see, Maurice,
Mr. Alex was grooming his friend.

860
00:56:05,775 --> 00:56:09,211
He is clearly a tender, loving thing.

861
00:56:09,279 --> 00:56:12,214
How can you have the
heebie-jeebies for Mr. Alex?

862
00:56:12,282 --> 00:56:15,945
Look at him.
He's so cute and plushy.

863
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:18,544
I don't think he was grooming him.

864
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:21,089
Look more like
he was tasting him to me.

865
00:56:21,157 --> 00:56:24,490
Suit yourself, no matter.
I don't care.

866
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,724
Soon we will put my
excellent plan to action.

867
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:31,528
All we have to do is wait

868
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:35,264
until they are deep in their sleep.

869
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:43,878
How long is this going to take?!

870
00:57:10,306 --> 00:57:11,739
Well, this sucks!

871
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:15,673
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

872
00:57:16,813 --> 00:57:19,338
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

873
00:57:19,949 --> 00:57:21,746
Rise and shining.

874
00:57:21,818 --> 00:57:25,015
Wakey-waking, Mr. Alex!

875
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:26,555
Wake up! Alex!

876
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,318
You suck your thumb?

877
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:33,955
Where are we?
What the heck is going on?

878
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:36,294
Where's the beach?
Take it easy.

879
00:57:36,366 --> 00:57:39,358
- Who built a forest?
- Don't be alarmed, giant freaks.

880
00:57:39,435 --> 00:57:40,629
While you were asleep,

881
00:57:40,703 --> 00:57:44,867
we simply took you
to our little corner of heaven.

882
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:47,205
Welcome to Madagascar.

883
00:57:47,276 --> 00:57:49,836
- Mada-who-ah?
- What?

884
00:57:49,912 --> 00:57:52,278
No, not whooha. Ascar.

885
00:57:59,922 --> 00:58:01,617
Marty. It's...

886
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:04,251
Just like my mural back at the zoo.

887
00:58:04,327 --> 00:58:08,491
Oh, no, fella, that is
the real deal right there.

888
00:58:08,564 --> 00:58:10,623
Look at that, that's not a bad view.

889
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:14,602
That's the thing that you were always
looking at, but it's actually there.

890
00:58:14,737 --> 00:58:18,138
- That's the real version of...
- How about once around the park?

891
00:58:18,307 --> 00:58:21,640
Let's get our blood pumping,
lungs breathing this fresh air.

892
00:58:21,711 --> 00:58:23,110
Who's with me?!

893
00:58:23,179 --> 00:58:25,647
Naw. I don't think I could...
You're it!

894
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:27,307
Hey! Want to play around?

895
00:58:29,552 --> 00:58:30,746
Got you there!

896
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,185
Come here!

897
00:58:32,555 --> 00:58:33,749
You're it.

898
00:58:33,823 --> 00:58:36,553
Hey, stop that!
Hey, you're crazy!

899
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,720
Okay, Marty, I'm it.

900
00:58:39,796 --> 00:58:42,287
I'm it. I'm it. You win.

901
00:58:42,365 --> 00:58:44,856
Come on, Alex, get in the groove.

902
00:58:44,934 --> 00:58:46,834
I haven't eaten in two days.

903
00:58:46,903 --> 00:58:50,031
My blood sugar's real low.
I just don't have the energy.

904
00:58:50,106 --> 00:58:51,971
I don't think that's your problem.

905
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:54,737
First of all, that's not
how you run in the wild.

906
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:56,779
Let's go. Put the rubber to the road!

907
00:58:56,846 --> 00:58:58,837
You just have
to let out that inner lion.

908
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:02,351
- Now, who's the cat?
- Marty, I really don't...

909
00:59:02,418 --> 00:59:05,581
You are, that's who.
Come on! Here we go!

910
00:59:05,655 --> 00:59:08,453
That's it. Let's build up
some steam! You the cat.

911
00:59:08,524 --> 00:59:10,116
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

912
00:59:10,193 --> 00:59:11,785
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

913
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:15,456
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

914
00:59:15,531 --> 00:59:19,661
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

915
00:59:21,003 --> 00:59:22,800
I'm the cat!

916
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:30,078
Surprise!

917
00:59:37,587 --> 00:59:39,111
You're it. You're it!

918
00:59:39,188 --> 00:59:41,486
Cant juke the cat. Cat's too quick.

919
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:49,796
I feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye
on the fly from the deli in the sky!

920
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,826
- Let's go wild!
- Now you're talking!

921
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:03,673
Man! I feel different.

922
01:00:03,746 --> 01:00:07,045
Noogie, noogie, noogie.
Noogie, noogie, noogie!

923
01:00:08,518 --> 01:00:10,679
Kind of charged up or something.

924
01:00:10,753 --> 01:00:13,551
- Like you said, baby, it's...
- Crackalacking.

925
01:00:13,623 --> 01:00:18,060
- Ain't that right, Melman?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

926
01:00:20,763 --> 01:00:22,321
I'm in heaven.

927
01:00:22,398 --> 01:00:27,335
You see, Maurice, Alex is now our friend
and the fossas are nowhere to be seen.

928
01:00:27,403 --> 01:00:30,304
It could be said
that my plan is working

929
01:00:30,373 --> 01:00:33,672
in a very good working kind of way.

930
01:00:33,743 --> 01:00:36,871
Alex. You got to try some of this.

931
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:40,982
I feel good.
Feel like a king again.

932
01:00:41,817 --> 01:00:42,977
King?

933
01:00:43,786 --> 01:00:45,583
You should see his act.

934
01:00:45,655 --> 01:00:48,852
Come on, Alex, why don't you
show him some of your act.

935
01:00:48,925 --> 01:00:51,826
Oh. No, I really
don't think I could... Okay.

936
01:00:51,894 --> 01:00:55,159
Ladies and gentlemen.
Primates of all ages.

937
01:00:55,231 --> 01:00:57,358
The wild proudly presents:

938
01:00:57,433 --> 01:00:58,900
The king.

939
01:00:58,968 --> 01:01:01,766
Alex the lion!

940
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:04,034
E flat, fellas.

941
01:01:13,482 --> 01:01:16,212
Yeah! The king is in the house!

942
01:01:16,285 --> 01:01:20,153
See, if he is the king, then where
is his crown? I've got a crown.

943
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:23,350
Got a very nice one.
And it's here on my head.

944
01:01:23,426 --> 01:01:25,394
Look at it. Have I got it on?

945
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:33,692
Do the roar, man. Do the roar.

946
01:01:38,841 --> 01:01:42,174
Wow. I've never heard
that one before.

947
01:01:42,244 --> 01:01:44,474
Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on!

948
01:01:46,015 --> 01:01:47,243
Break out the wave!

949
01:02:14,143 --> 01:02:16,304
Excuse me.

950
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:18,609
You're biting my butt.

951
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:23,384
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

952
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:27,380
- What did you do?
- You just bit me!

953
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:29,617
No. I didn't. Did I?

954
01:02:29,692 --> 01:02:31,250
You kind of did.

955
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:33,454
What the heck is wrong with you?

956
01:02:35,197 --> 01:02:36,459
Why'd you bite me?

957
01:02:36,532 --> 01:02:39,330
- Man, it's because you are his dinner.
- What?!

958
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:41,666
- Excuse me?
- That's dumb.

959
01:02:41,737 --> 01:02:46,197
Come, come, Maurice. What is a simple
bite on the buttocks among friends?

960
01:02:46,275 --> 01:02:48,140
Here, give me a nibble.

961
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:51,907
The party is over, Julien.
Your brilliant plan has failed.

962
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:53,744
What are you talking about?

963
01:02:53,816 --> 01:02:55,511
Your friend here is what we call

964
01:02:55,584 --> 01:02:58,747
a deluxe-model hunting
and eating machine.

965
01:02:58,821 --> 01:03:00,755
And he eats steak...

966
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:02,290
...which is you.

967
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:06,556
- Get out of here.
- Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it.

968
01:03:06,629 --> 01:03:08,460
The plan failed.

969
01:03:08,531 --> 01:03:11,796
All is lost! We're all doomed.

970
01:03:11,867 --> 01:03:16,668
The fossas will come back and
gobble us with their mouths because...

971
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:19,105
...we are all steak.

972
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:21,040
I'm steak! Me, me, me!

973
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:23,340
Mr. Alex cannot stay here.

974
01:03:23,412 --> 01:03:27,746
He belongs with his own kind
on the fossa side of the island.

975
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:29,717
By the power vested in me,

976
01:03:29,785 --> 01:03:33,084
by the law of the jungle,
blah, blah, blah, blah...

977
01:03:33,155 --> 01:03:34,315
Be gone!

978
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:37,223
What? Come on, do I look
like a steak to you?

979
01:03:37,293 --> 01:03:38,521
Yeah!

980
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:41,495
See, I told you I don't
look like a... Wait. What you say?

981
01:03:41,564 --> 01:03:43,964
Oh, yeah!

982
01:03:45,468 --> 01:03:49,063
- He's going savage.
- Run for your lives.

983
01:03:51,073 --> 01:03:52,734
Marty, run!

984
01:04:10,326 --> 01:04:13,261
A bull's eye.
Excellent shot, Maurice.

985
01:04:13,329 --> 01:04:14,421
Thank you.

986
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:21,064
Marty?

987
01:04:23,506 --> 01:04:25,406
I'm so sorry, Marty.

988
01:04:29,912 --> 01:04:32,676
What is wrong with me?

989
01:04:32,748 --> 01:04:35,080
Ow.

990
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:36,948
Oh, no.

991
01:04:37,019 --> 01:04:38,680
What have I done?

992
01:04:38,754 --> 01:04:41,848
It's true. I'm a monster.

993
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:43,892
I got to get out of here.

994
01:06:55,491 --> 01:06:58,858
What have I done?
This is a nightmare.

995
01:06:58,928 --> 01:07:00,657
And it's all my fault.

996
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:03,698
Now, because of me,
we've lost Alex.

997
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:05,427
Well, what are we going to do?

998
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:08,163
We'll find a way to help him.
That's what we'll do.

999
01:07:08,237 --> 01:07:09,226
Okay.

1000
01:07:09,305 --> 01:07:12,035
Come on, we are New Yorkers, right?

1001
01:07:12,107 --> 01:07:14,371
We're tough.
We're gritty.

1002
01:07:14,443 --> 01:07:16,172
We're adaptable!

1003
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:19,180
And we are not going
to lay down like a bunch of Melmans.

1004
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:21,716
No, we're not.

1005
01:07:21,784 --> 01:07:23,046
Oh. Gloria.

1006
01:07:23,118 --> 01:07:26,246
That was not me, okay?
That was the boat.

1007
01:07:26,388 --> 01:07:28,515
- The boat!
- The boat?

1008
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:32,583
The boat's come back for us!
Come on, guys, we got to flag it down.

1009
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:35,719
There it is!

1010
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:37,732
- Hey, over here!
- Over here!

1011
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,267
Over here! Yo!

1012
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:42,031
Melman, give me a lift.
Hurry up! Lift me up!

1013
01:07:42,104 --> 01:07:43,503
Help! Help! Help!

1014
01:07:43,572 --> 01:07:46,405
- Oh, my neck. My neck. You guys.
- Over here!

1015
01:07:46,475 --> 01:07:50,206
- Melman! Steady. This way!
- You have no idea how much this hurts.

1016
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:52,144
Hey, boat! We're over here!

1017
01:07:54,383 --> 01:07:58,479
Look! It's turning! It's coming back!
It's coming back!

1018
01:07:58,554 --> 01:08:00,852
Come on! Come on, baby!

1019
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:03,686
Yes! You guys.

1020
01:08:03,759 --> 01:08:06,057
You flag down that boat.
I'll get Alex.

1021
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:08,961
Whoa! Hold on there.

1022
01:08:09,031 --> 01:08:11,431
You cannot go back there by yourself.

1023
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,832
Aw, come on. I know Alex.

1024
01:08:13,902 --> 01:08:16,666
He hears we're rescued,
he'll snap right out of it.

1025
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:19,173
The people are coming.
They can help us.

1026
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:22,233
Melman's right. The people
will know what to do.

1027
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:24,541
Now, we got to flag down that boat.

1028
01:08:42,931 --> 01:08:45,593
Now, this is more like it.

1029
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:49,034
You?! Oh, ma...
Where are the people?

1030
01:08:49,104 --> 01:08:51,038
We killed them and ate their livers.

1031
01:08:53,108 --> 01:08:54,405
Got you, didn't I?

1032
01:08:54,476 --> 01:08:57,104
Just kidding, doll,
the people are fine.

1033
01:08:57,746 --> 01:09:00,510
They're on a slow lifeboat to China.

1034
01:09:00,582 --> 01:09:02,948
Hey, I know you two.

1035
01:09:03,018 --> 01:09:07,455
Where's that psychotic lion
and our monochromatic friend?

1036
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:11,482
Marty? He's righ... Where did
he go? He was right behind us.

1037
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,121
He went back for Alex.
He's going to get himself killed!

1038
01:09:15,197 --> 01:09:18,360
Well, boys, our
monochromatic friend's in danger.

1039
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:20,334
Looks like we have a job to do.

1040
01:09:20,402 --> 01:09:23,269
Captain's log: Embarking
into hostile environment.

1041
01:09:23,338 --> 01:09:26,865
Kowalski. We'll need to win the
hearts and the minds of the natives.

1042
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:29,510
Rico. We'll need
special tactical equipment.

1043
01:09:29,578 --> 01:09:32,172
We're going to face extreme peril.

1044
01:09:32,247 --> 01:09:34,647
Private probably won't survive.

1045
01:09:41,457 --> 01:09:44,324
Alex! Come out, Alex!

1046
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:46,691
The boat's here! We can go home!

1047
01:09:53,202 --> 01:09:58,299
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1048
01:09:58,474 --> 01:10:03,070
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1049
01:10:03,712 --> 01:10:06,579
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1050
01:10:06,648 --> 01:10:10,379
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1051
01:10:10,452 --> 01:10:11,851
Alex!

1052
01:10:13,856 --> 01:10:14,845
Alex!

1053
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:18,225
Marty?

1054
01:10:18,293 --> 01:10:22,059
Snap out of it, Alex. The boat
came back. We can get out of here.

1055
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:26,192
We can go back to civilization, and
everything will be like it used to be.

1056
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:27,758
Stay back.

1057
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:29,862
Please.

1058
01:10:31,006 --> 01:10:32,940
I'm a monster.

1059
01:10:33,008 --> 01:10:36,375
Alex, you're no monster.
You're my friend.

1060
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:39,539
We're a team.
You and me, remember?

1061
01:10:47,422 --> 01:10:49,549
I don't want to hurt you.

1062
01:11:20,923 --> 01:11:22,788
Alex.

1063
01:11:22,858 --> 01:11:24,917
I ain't leaving without you.

1064
01:11:40,742 --> 01:11:44,007
Alex? I'm thinking of a song.

1065
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:48,072
It's a wonderful song.
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

1066
01:11:49,418 --> 01:11:53,252
Start spreadin' the news

1067
01:11:54,389 --> 01:11:58,155
I'm leaving today

1068
01:11:59,194 --> 01:12:02,857
We are a great big part of it

1069
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:09,560
Come on, you know the words.
Two little words.

1070
01:12:09,638 --> 01:12:12,300
Please don't make me
sing this by myself.

1071
01:12:12,374 --> 01:12:15,571
You really don't want
to hear me sing this by myself.

1072
01:12:19,214 --> 01:12:22,877
Uh, Alex? Could you
come out here for a minute?

1073
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:26,387
Hey, Alex, a little help.

1074
01:12:27,322 --> 01:12:28,653
Help me!

1075
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:31,920
Alex! Help!

1076
01:12:35,998 --> 01:12:40,128
Help me! Anybody, help me! Somebody!

1077
01:12:40,869 --> 01:12:43,269
Help!

1078
01:12:54,483 --> 01:12:56,075
- Melman?
- That's right, baby.

1079
01:12:57,653 --> 01:12:58,984
Run!

1080
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,281
- What's the plan?
- This is the plan.

1081
01:13:03,358 --> 01:13:04,950
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

1082
01:13:05,027 --> 01:13:07,257
This is the plan?

1083
01:13:07,329 --> 01:13:08,626
Fossa halt.

1084
01:13:11,266 --> 01:13:13,700
Fossa ooh.

1085
01:13:14,469 --> 01:13:16,369
Fossa aaahh.

1086
01:13:17,639 --> 01:13:20,039
Fossa ooh.

1087
01:13:21,576 --> 01:13:23,942
Fossa aaahh.

1088
01:13:24,813 --> 01:13:26,576
Come and get it.

1089
01:13:26,648 --> 01:13:27,672
Fossa.

1090
01:13:40,362 --> 01:13:42,296
- Take that.
- Fossa ow!

1091
01:13:42,364 --> 01:13:44,798
There's too many of them, skipper.

1092
01:13:44,866 --> 01:13:47,960
It's been a real pleasure
serving with you boys.

1093
01:13:53,709 --> 01:13:56,075
Alex?

1094
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:57,577
That's my kill.

1095
01:13:57,646 --> 01:13:59,011
Mine.

1096
01:14:04,753 --> 01:14:06,414
Alex hungry.

1097
01:14:07,756 --> 01:14:09,280
Alex eat.

1098
01:14:26,174 --> 01:14:27,505
It's showtime.

1099
01:14:29,611 --> 01:14:31,340
Thanks for not giving up on me.

1100
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:36,283
Man, you almost gave me a heart attack.
You cant just come sneak up on me.

1101
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:39,377
Just because you're a lion...
Let go of me. Let go of me.

1102
01:14:39,454 --> 01:14:42,855
We're getting out of here.
Guys, just go with me on this.

1103
01:14:42,924 --> 01:14:44,983
Like I said, it's showtime.

1104
01:14:46,461 --> 01:14:47,655
Mine.

1105
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:50,361
My kill.

1106
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,661
They're all mine.

1107
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,805
It's the king of the beasts! Oh, no!

1108
01:14:57,873 --> 01:14:59,864
- Don't eat me!
- He's big and scary!

1109
01:14:59,941 --> 01:15:03,342
Fear me! Savagery
beyond comprehension.

1110
01:15:03,412 --> 01:15:07,371
- I am far too young to die!
- You're a monster! A monster, I say!

1111
01:15:07,449 --> 01:15:09,940
- And, you!
- Me?

1112
01:15:14,022 --> 01:15:18,823
Oh, you want some of this? Ooh!
You better run for your lives.

1113
01:15:19,227 --> 01:15:22,355
- Somebody call a cop!
- He's psychotic!

1114
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:32,168
This is my territory.
Understand?

1115
01:15:33,308 --> 01:15:37,369
I never, ever want
to see you on my turf again.

1116
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:45,074
Boo.

1117
01:15:47,989 --> 01:15:49,854
Yeah! You the cat!

1118
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:52,758
Got my boy back!

1119
01:15:54,296 --> 01:15:55,695
I did it!

1120
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:59,791
Give me some love! The plan worked!
The plan worked! I'm very clever!

1121
01:15:59,868 --> 01:16:03,201
I'm the one, baby! Come on.
Time to robot.

1122
01:16:03,271 --> 01:16:05,432
I am very clever king.

1123
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:07,800
I am super genius.

1124
01:16:07,876 --> 01:16:10,470
I am robot king of the monkey things.

1125
01:16:10,545 --> 01:16:14,072
- Compute, compute.
- So, what's for lunch?

1126
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:18,385
- Close those eyes.
- Why do I have to?

1127
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:19,920
- Do it.
- They're closed.

1128
01:16:19,988 --> 01:16:21,853
- Tighter.
- Yes, sir.

1129
01:16:21,923 --> 01:16:23,652
- No peeking.
- They're closed.

1130
01:16:23,725 --> 01:16:25,488
Rico.

1131
01:16:29,364 --> 01:16:30,422
Hai.

1132
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,294
Open that hatch.

1133
01:16:34,236 --> 01:16:36,761
Fire in the hole. Now chew.

1134
01:16:37,572 --> 01:16:40,166
Chew like you mean it.
Savor it.

1135
01:16:41,009 --> 01:16:42,772
- And?
- Well?

1136
01:16:42,844 --> 01:16:44,709
Pretty good, right?

1137
01:16:44,779 --> 01:16:47,179
There's always Plan B.

1138
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:50,784
This is better than steak.

1139
01:16:50,852 --> 01:16:52,615
I love it. I love it!

1140
01:16:52,687 --> 01:16:54,678
The kitty loves the fishy.

1141
01:16:57,459 --> 01:16:59,825
Well, I propose a toast.

1142
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:02,830
Now, he may be a pain
in the butt at times...

1143
01:17:02,898 --> 01:17:05,025
And trust me, I know.

1144
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,796
But this cat proved
to me without a doubt

1145
01:17:07,869 --> 01:17:10,303
that his heart
is bigger than his stomach.

1146
01:17:10,372 --> 01:17:12,169
- To Alex.
- To Alex.

1147
01:17:19,481 --> 01:17:21,039
Enough! Stop it!

1148
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:25,979
What do you think?
Should we head back to New York?

1149
01:17:26,054 --> 01:17:28,545
I don't know. I mean,
this is your dream.

1150
01:17:28,623 --> 01:17:30,614
You sure you want to leave?

1151
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:32,660
I don't care where we are.

1152
01:17:32,727 --> 01:17:36,026
As long as we're together,
it doesn't matter to me.

1153
01:17:36,097 --> 01:17:37,724
Well, in that case...

1154
01:17:37,799 --> 01:17:40,962
Yo. Rico.
I'll take 300 orders to go.

1155
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:42,367
Hai.

1156
01:17:42,437 --> 01:17:46,168
But before you leave,
I have an announcement to make.

1157
01:17:46,241 --> 01:17:49,210
So shut up, everyone, please.
Thank you.

1158
01:17:49,277 --> 01:17:53,839
After much deep and profound
brain things inside my head,

1159
01:17:53,915 --> 01:17:56,247
I have decided to thank you

1160
01:17:56,318 --> 01:17:59,048
for bringing peace to our home.

1161
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,781
And to make you feel good,

1162
01:18:00,855 --> 01:18:03,688
I'm going to give you
this lovely parting gift.

1163
01:18:03,758 --> 01:18:06,591
No, I couldn't. Really,
I can't take your crown.

1164
01:18:06,661 --> 01:18:09,152
That's okay,
I've got a bigger crown.

1165
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:10,527
It's got a gecko on it.

1166
01:18:10,599 --> 01:18:13,796
Look at him shake.
Go, Stevie, go!

1167
01:18:14,836 --> 01:18:16,251
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

1168
01:18:16,286 --> 01:18:17,667
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

1169
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:19,229
- So long!
- Bye-bye, now.

1170
01:18:19,307 --> 01:18:20,899
- Arrivederci.
- Bye-bye.

1171
01:18:20,976 --> 01:18:23,638
- Toodle-oo!
- See you later, crocodile.

1172
01:18:23,712 --> 01:18:26,806
Maurice, my arm is tired.
Wave it for me.

1173
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:29,913
Faster, you naughty little monkey.

1174
01:18:29,985 --> 01:18:33,352
By the time we get back to New York,
it'll be the middle of winter.

1175
01:18:33,421 --> 01:18:35,446
So I was just thinking, why rush?

1176
01:18:35,523 --> 01:18:38,458
Maybe we could make
a few side stops along the way.

1177
01:18:38,526 --> 01:18:40,926
- Maybe Paris.
- You just read my mind.

1178
01:18:40,996 --> 01:18:43,430
- I was thinking Spain.
- Run with the bulls.

1179
01:18:43,498 --> 01:18:46,262
- What about Fiji?
- Canada. Can we?

1180
01:18:46,334 --> 01:18:48,199
Cheap meds.

1181
01:18:48,269 --> 01:18:50,965
I wouldn't even mind
coming back here sometime.

1182
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:53,371
- I could do that.
- You could say that again.

1183
01:18:53,441 --> 01:18:56,410
- Skipper?
- I always wanted to go to Australia.

1184
01:18:56,478 --> 01:19:00,073
Don't you think we should tell
them that the boat's out of gas?

1185
01:19:00,148 --> 01:19:01,274
Nah.

1186
01:19:01,349 --> 01:19:05,251
Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.
