1
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,519
(tyres screech)

2
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,518
(young woman) My parents
were born into the good life.

3
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,068
Old money, blue-blooded
society sweethearts.

4
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,993
- Do you want a boy or girl?
- We'll be happy with either.

5
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,358
Having played host to kings
and queens and other powers that be,

6
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,477
they were used to gracing the pages
of society columns.

7
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,199
- I'm gonna be sick!
- So they welcomed the attention

8
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,670
on what they supposed would be
the happiest day of their lives.

9
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,796
But local legend had it that a curse
was put on the Wilhern family,

10
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,670
when my
great-great-great-grandfather Ralph

11
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,355
had a fling with Clara,
a lowly servant girl.

12
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,477
When he told his family
of his plans to marry Clara,...

13
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,189
- (laughter)
-..he realised how silly he'd been.

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,317
Clara was, after all,
just a servant girl.

15
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,115
So Ralph married someone
more suitable,

16
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,272
and Clara... fell off a cliff.

17
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,588
(thud)

18
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,558
- (thunder)
- That night, Clara 's mother,

19
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,077
the town witch, came to
the Wilhern house seeking revenge.

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,673
She wanted these blue bloods

21
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,399
to feel the pain of rejection
her daughter felt,

22
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,040
and commanded
that the next Wilhern daughter

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,588
be born with the face of a pig.

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,559
And only when one of your own kind
claims this daughter as their own,

25
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,872
till death do they part,
will the curse be broken!

26
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,797
With the threat of the curse
hanging over their heads,

27
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,236
the next five Wilhern brides
lived in terror

28
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,914
of being the first to give birth
to a daughter.

29
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,516
But as luck would have it,
they gave birth to all sons,

30
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,628
who had all sons, who had all sons,
who had all sons.

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,714
Finally, born to Ella and Leonard
Wilhern, a beautiful baby girl.

32
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,672
But what they didn't know then
was that Ella

33
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,274
hadn't actually given birth
to a Wilhern.

34
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,432
She had given birth to... a Jones.

35
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,358
Which means that
the first-born Wilhern girl...

36
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,908
(screams)

37
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,553
-.. was me.
- (baby cries)

38
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,639
(man) Penelope.

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,235
- (man) Dear, sweet Penelope.
- (Penelope) Hm-hmm?

40
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,954
You see, like you,
I've felt imprisoned most of my life.

41
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,911
(Penelope) Really? By what?

42
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,997
- Your good looks and good name?
- Yes, exactly.

43
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,154
(Penelope)
No one seems able to see past that.

44
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,118
(man) No one. And, Penelope,

45
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,512
curse or no curse, if I am more
than my name and my face,...

46
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,274
..well, then, surely you
are more than yours.

47
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,716
- I knew it. He's the one.
- He just might be.

48
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,274
Sweet Penelope,... Iet me in.

49
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,155
Oh, Penelope, let me in.

50
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,235
No!

51
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,198
- (Penelope) Hello.
- (gasps) What...?

52
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,036
Help me! Help me!

53
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,514
(yells) She's a pig!

54
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,711
She's a killer pig!

55
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,870
Help me! Somebody, help!

56
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,755
Why, Penelope? Why?

57
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,990
I'm not the one who ran, Mother.

58
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,278
Of course they run, dear, when you
spring yourself at them like that!

59
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,148
Do you think I showed your father
my mole on our third date? No, dear.

60
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,471
I had the good sense to wait
until after we were married!

61
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,031
I didn't show him my mole, Mother.
I showed him my face.

62
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,554
- (sobs)
- (sighs)

63
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,836
- (sobs)
- Mom.

64
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,715
Oh! Oh, sweetheart.

65
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,109
He really liked you.

66
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,270
- No, Mom, he really didn't.
- No!

67
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,036
He didn't like your nose, that's what
he didn't like. You're not your nose.

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,350
- But, it... it is my nose.
- No!

69
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,238
It's your
great-great-great-grandfather's nose

70
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,472
on your father's side.
He did this to you, to us.

71
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,677
But you are not your nose!
You are not you!

72
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,915
You're, you're somebody else inside
just waiting to come out.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,036
I had been reminded over the years

74
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,475
that I was not the only victim
of the curse.

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,549
(sobs)

76
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,108
No one suffered more than my mother.

77
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,760
- These things happen all the time.
- T o who?

78
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,593
Did you know some children
are born with gills?

79
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,319
- Ugh!
- Gills, sweetheart, like on a fish.

80
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,197
Oh!

81
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,953
- So, can you cut it off?
- Strangest thing.

82
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,874
But the carotid artery appears to run
directly through the nose,

83
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,599
or snout, as the case may be,

84
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,717
making any attempt at removal
unfeasible.

85
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,274
- But...
- I'm sorry.

86
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,999
- The snout stays.
- (sobs)

87
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,197
- Oh, that's not true!
- My mother meant well.

88
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,998
She always meant well,

89
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,958
and always did
what she thought best to protect me.

90
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,116
- First, from reporters.
- What are you...?

91
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,512
Ow! Ow, my eye! Ow, ow!

92
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,034
But with the public
demanding to see the face

93
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,350
that had caused so much trouble,

94
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,432
my mother did
what any loving mother would do.

95
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,431
She faked my death.

96
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,230
(priest) Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

97
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,629
And had me cremated.

98
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,110
So, with the public left to mourn
my tragic passing,

99
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,998
and with me safely hidden away
from the outside world,

100
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,709
now she need only worry about
protecting me from my father,

101
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,429
who was having trouble adjusting
to the new morning menu.

102
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,795
Why can't I have bacon?

103
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,429
Because you love oatmeal.
Doesn't Daddy love oatmeal? Yeah.

104
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,192
No, I love bacon.

105
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,113
And from the insensitivity
of the new butler, Jake.

106
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,397
- This little piggy had roast beef.
- Jake!

107
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,677
Oh, Jake. Stop it! Oh, the poor baby.

108
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,959
And occasionally she had to
protect me even from myself.

109
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,112
So I did most of my playing in my room.

110
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,634
- Yes.
- Where I made my own friends,

111
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,518
and learned to entertain myself.

112
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,638
Meanwhile, my mother
spent her every waking hour

113
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,790
preparing me to be a suitable bride.

114
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,633
- (tape) "Quelle heure est il?"
- Quelle heure est il?

115
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,439
And on my 1 8th birthday,
she hired Wanda,

116
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,114
matchmaker to the rich and famous.

117
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,716
Now, to break the curse, they just
had to find a high-society blue blood,

118
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,631
one of my own kind,

119
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,918
to accept me as I am,
till death do we part.

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,194
Hello.

121
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,709
(groans)

122
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,759
And upon their departure,
they were invited back to the house,

123
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,479
where they were legally gagged
into secrecy.

124
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,677
I guess I looked
even worse than I thought.

125
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,751
And it was just a matter of time

126
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,549
before my mother recognised the need
for certain adjustments.

127
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,512
Shatterproof glass,
and sneakers for Jake.

128
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,194
- (man screams)
- So, you see, today...

129
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,751
- She's a pig!
-.. was much like any other.

130
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,556
- Except...
- I couldn't catch him.

131
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,868
Oh! I knew it!

132
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,238
(mother) We should make them sign
the gag before they see her, not after!

133
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,752
- A snout?
- Yeah.

134
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,679
- And fangs. You know?
- (laughter)

135
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,513
Listen, I know what you're thinking.

136
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,071
The Wilherns! Nice family, right?
That's what I thought.

137
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,199
When Penelope mentioned the curse,
I thought it was a figure of speech.

138
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,999
It's not a figure of speech.

139
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,119
I'm telling you, if I hadn't
got out of there when I did,

140
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,430
that monster would've eaten me alive.

141
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,957
- Put him in holding overnight.
- What? Me? No, you don't understand!

142
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,349
- I've come in to report her!
- (door slams)

143
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,590
Hey, wasn't that a Vanderman?

144
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,877
Yeah, Edward. The guy's crazy.

145
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,948
(Edward) Hello, anybody?

146
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,474
(Edward) Will somebody call
my mother?

147
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,318
(whimpers)

148
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,670
(mother) Rise and shine!

149
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,914
Up, up, up, up, up.

150
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,151
We're moving!

151
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,037
Franklin!

152
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,111
- Mom!
- Up, up, up, up, up.

153
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,078
- What? We're moving?
- Uh-huh.

154
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,878
(elevator bell)

155
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,193
Where is Larry Bonsa? Hmm?

156
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,428
Security.

157
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,750
Poor Edward. I had no idea.

158
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,558
No, not that.

159
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,030
Hallucinations of a hideous pi...
(whispers) Pig-faced girl.

160
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,749
- Huh?
- You do know who they're talking about?

161
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,997
Oh, I don't know. Could be any number
of women in this city.

162
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,550
I'm next in line
for chairman of the board!

163
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,393
Do you have any idea
what a story like this will do to me?

164
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,597
What my father is going to do to me?

165
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,154
Well, that's not really my problem, now.

166
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,588
OK. OK, I'm not a delusional maniac,
yeah? Am l?

167
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,390
No. So, either you print a retraction

168
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,157
or, so help me God, I am going to
rip your guts out, one gut at a time!

169
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,151
It'll be 25 years ago all over again.

170
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,028
Reporters popping out of drawers.
Penelope will be exposed!

171
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,317
And then...
And then what chance do we have?

172
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,233
- We could move to the beach.
- (Franklin) The beach is good.

173
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,709
- Or France?
- You could practise your French.

174
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,394
- I could practise my French.
- Hm-hmm.

175
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,159
- Merci.
- (plates smash)

176
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,119
- Bonjour. Je m'appelle Penelope.
- (screaming)

177
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,079
Never mind. I overreacted.

178
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,116
Wanda. Wanda!

179
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,197
(Edward) I demand a retraction!

180
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,669
You have ruined my life!

181
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,910
I'm telling you, she was a pig. A pig!

182
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,198
I'm telling you, she had a piggy snout
on her face and I'm not mad!

183
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,396
Why will no one believe me?

184
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,631
Wait, wait, wait! Hold on there, Victor.

185
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,310
I believe that man is with me.

186
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,350
Huh? I am?

187
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,993
(Wanda) Jessica,
this isn't the cream of the crop.

188
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,958
- (Jessica) I don't care.
- First, there's Beaux...

189
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,268
- Great.
- Jack...

190
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,588
- Fine.
- The Ripper?

191
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,715
Super, who else?

192
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,439
Why don't I just say,
"Here's 1 2 men. Trust me."?

193
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,273
Terrific. Let's talk about the dowry.
Double it.

194
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,352
If they can't stand me now,
why would they for double?

195
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,479
- Oh, now, with that attitude...
- Oh, yeah, it's my attitude, Mother.

196
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,790
(Jessica) What do you think of this guy?

197
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,833
(Wanda) I think this guy's got
a lot of potential.

198
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,310
I know he's going to look at her.
What do you think of this guy?

199
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,669
Oh, sweetheart.

200
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,190
I know, I know.

201
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,432
It's not my face, it's my
great-great-great-grandfather's face,

202
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,751
and he's not me
and I'm not him and I'm not me.

203
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,229
And don't you forget it.

204
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,310
I gave my right eye for that story.

205
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,749
And I got back squat. That hideous
woman still gives me nightmares.

206
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,592
I thought you never saw her.

207
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,549
No, not Penelope. Her mother.
I only caught a glimpse of the baby.

208
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,313
I thought my head
was playing tricks on me.

209
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,868
Well, thank God
someone believes me, anyway.

210
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,555
Unfortunately, my believing you
won't to do either one of us any good.

211
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,679
We're gonna need some proof
to clear both our names.

212
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,870
Do you think
you can get back in there?

213
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,678
Oh, I don't... I don't know.

214
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,078
- I mean, the...
- (roars)

215
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,354
(gasps)

216
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,432
- No.
- Are you sure?

217
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,432
- I just need one photo.
- I'm not going back in there.

218
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,159
Alright. OK.

219
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,670
We'll just have to find
somebody who can,

220
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,990
hook them up with the agency
that sent you.

221
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,675
No, they only see old money,
blue bloods. It's part of the curse.

222
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,513
I don't think we'll find
any blue bloods to help us.

223
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,593
- They don't need the money.
- But down-and-out blue bloods do.

224
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,317
# On my mind, on my mind,
on my mind, on my mind

225
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,915
# There's a thing that I can't explain

226
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,990
Check.

227
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,393
Bet.

228
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,477
- Read 'em and weep, losers.
- Ah, crap!

229
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,034
You got a Maxwell Campion
playing here tonight?

230
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,271
That's him there.
Poker table number five.

231
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,757
# Talking of life

232
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,154
# I'm not too keen

233
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,071
Hey, pal, wait up.

234
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,632
- Do I know you?
- No, but I know you.

235
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,678
Did a little research.
And it seems, in a few short years,

236
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,719
you've gambled away the fortune
your family spent generations building.

237
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,758
- (laughs)
- Hey, hear me out.

238
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,037
- I'll make it worth your while.
- You got the wrong guy.

239
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,754
5,000 bucks worth your while?

240
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,469
Wow, this guy is wasting my time.

241
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,710
- Oh, he's here.
- Hey, man, look, I'm sorry...

242
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,950
- Let's go. Take off the jacket.
- What?

243
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,749
We'll need your signature on the last
page. Just your standard gag.

244
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,637
You don't talk, we don't talk.

245
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,916
Just how ugly is this girl?

246
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,030
I believe the young lady is waiting.

247
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,238
The camera is in the lapel,
the rigging is in the sleeve. Put it on.

248
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,430
To take her picture,
you raise either arm.

249
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,636
- (camera clicks)
- Not now.

250
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,712
- (laughs) Alright. I'm sorry, man.
- Yeah, I know you are.

251
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,634
- Did you have to gamble all night?
- Yeah, I still had chips.

252
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,837
- I'm good?
- Yeah. Come on, let's go.

253
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,358
- Oh, l...
- I'll get that.

254
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,431
And you are?

255
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,909
I'm Max Campion
and the agency sent me.

256
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,197
Oh, right. Campion...

257
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,669
(chatter)

258
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,228
(door slams)

259
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,992
(room falls silent)

260
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,670
(chatter resumes)

261
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,836
(camera clicks)

262
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,558
Alright, we've done as you asked.
They're in the annex.

263
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,269
But why you wouldn't rather talk to them
one at a time is beyond me.

264
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,158
This way it will be easier
to weed out the unlikelies.

265
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,559
Yeah.

266
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,079
Hello, I'm Penelope. And you must be...

267
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,799
(screaming)

268
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,916
..Iate for tea?

269
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,110
They're out, they're running.
They've all seen her.

270
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,875
- Where's Max?
- I don't see Max. He's not there.

271
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,791
(Edward) There's no Max.

272
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,430
- How could you?
- Just speeding things up.

273
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,637
- Now you'll make a pig of yourself?
- No, that's been done for me.

274
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,998
- Stop it!
- That was the last of the Ho Hos!

275
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
Where's your credit card?
I'm going to the store.

276
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,948
No, no, don't you... Hey!

277
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,600
If you want more Ho Hos,
I'll send Jake for some!

278
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,070
- I'm old enough to get my own!
- Pick me up some chocolates.

279
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,555
- Penelope, just one man, one man.
- He'll run, too.

280
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,518
They always run.
Why can't you accept that?

281
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,637
For seven years,
I've been watching them run.

282
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,634
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

283
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,191
- Do you?
- I'm sorry, but we just can't quit.

284
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,511
We can, because
no matter how much I wanna believe

285
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,716
there's one man who won't run away,

286
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,598
one man who... who...

287
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,029
Sweet loving angel
of all things merciful!

288
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,079
(Penelope) Did he see?

289
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,196
(Jessica) He must have. He was there.

290
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,271
- Who is he?
- Who cares? Just go!

291
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,713
- Yes, go!
- No, l...

292
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,756
(both) Go!

293
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,308
- (camera clicks)
- Damn it!

294
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,873
- You're still here?
- Whoa. Er, yeah.

295
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,394
- Did you see?
- See?

296
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,630
- You didn't see?
- I didn't?

297
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,111
- Did you?
- Did I what?

298
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,794
- Don't mess with me.
- I'm messing with you?

299
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,190
- Why are you still here?
- Look, I'm sorry. Should I go?

300
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,952
(both) No.

301
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,150
Are you a fan of George Rockham?

302
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,791
- Who?
- The book you've got in your jacket.

303
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,389
You caught that, huh? Well, yeah.

304
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,550
Yeah, it's a great book.

305
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,518
- So you've read it?
- Well, yeah.

306
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,478
Funny, I thought that was
the only surviving copy.

307
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,313
Well... You know what? I, er...

308
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,358
I meant to read it,
but the library was always out.

309
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,998
And, er...

310
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,155
I saw it was a first edition
and figured it might be worth something.

311
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,356
So you were stealing it.

312
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,829
Well... (laughs) Yeah.

313
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,712
- I was stealing it.
- So, you're a fan of the money?

314
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,638
I'm a big fan of the money.
Although, it doesn't much care for me.

315
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,870
Maybe you and the money
weren't meant to be.

316
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,112
(laughs) Hey, I wouldn't go that far.
Jinx me.

317
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,669
There are 326 first editions
in that room.

318
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,991
Of those, 300 are worth over 50,000,

319
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,993
a dozen or so are worth over 25,000,

320
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,436
and I'm afraid there's only one
valued under a hundred.

321
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,556
- Only one, huh?
- A little novel

322
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,872
written by a little nobody
that never amounted to anything.

323
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,715
- You don't say. Under a hundred?
- I'm afraid so.

324
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,679
- And I'm afraid that means it's...
- It's your favourite, just the same.

325
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,119
- What?
- I said, your favourite, just the same.

326
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,553
I heard you.

327
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,398
Top shelf, third from the left,
Moby Dick. It's a first edition.

328
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,592
But wait till I'm gone
or they'll see you.

329
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,591
See me?

330
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,632
What?

331
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,838
Hello?

332
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,158
Hello?

333
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,558
(door slams)

334
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,393
Gotcha!

335
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,672
(laughs)

336
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,799
No?

337
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,198
Penelope?

338
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,234
Penelope?

339
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,999
- Will you be back tomorrow?
- I knew it. I knew you were there.

340
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,354
Yeah.

341
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,960
- He'll be back.
- He will.

342
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,036
- Hi.
- So?

343
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,509
- I didn't get it.
- How could you not get it?

344
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,990
- Half the men in this city...
- Relax. I'm coming back tomorrow.

345
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,276
Ow! Door.

346
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,114
- You better.
- See you tomorrow.

347
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,114
Sweetheart? What's wrong?

348
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,593
I thought he just knew,
but it says it right here.

349
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,116
(Franklin) Still, of the 2,000 books
that aren't your favourite,

350
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,031
he chose the one that is.

351
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,313
# The crisp sheet bedding
pulled down to the floor

352
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,756
# My raised, tired brows
have witnessed its lore

353
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,513
# And I won't have much to say

354
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,068
# If I don't return

355
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,793
# Easy risers don't give in to pleas

356
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,077
# They don 't take mess
from the sleepy streets

357
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,913
# And the abacus says

358
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,833
# Keep on counting

359
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,230
(grunts)

360
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,192
(whistles)

361
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,955
- (whistles)
- (Penelope) Do you play?

362
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,553
Whoa!

363
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,232
- I wish you'd stop doing that.
- Do you play?

364
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,790
The frog? No, no, although
I always meant to pick it up.

365
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,511
But you do play something.

366
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,279
- What makes you say that?
- What do you play?

367
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,679
Guess.

368
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,789
- Is this really necessary?
- She's finding his instrument.

369
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,633
Isn't that something
a man should do for himself?

370
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,030
And a one, and a two, and a one!
# You are my sunshine

371
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,350
- # My only sunshine
- (plays out of tune)

372
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,715
- # You make me happy
- (laughs)

373
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,597
# When skies are grey

374
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,989
- It's not the bass.
- # You'll never know, dear

375
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,877
# How much I love you

376
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,951
# So, please don't take

377
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,235
- # My sunshine away
- (clattering)

378
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,437
- (Penelope) Definitely not the drums.
- What?

379
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,110
(saxophone honks)

380
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,758
(Penelope groans)

381
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,559
- # You are my sunshine
- (plays out of tune)

382
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,790
# My only sunshine

383
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,030
# You make me happy

384
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,395
- # When skies are grey
- Terrible!

385
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,357
# You'll never know, dear

386
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,079
- # How much I love you
- Are you even playing that?

387
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,720
# Don't take my sunshine away

388
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,758
OK, stop! Stop!

389
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,311
Yeah! You guys, thank you so much
for everything.

390
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,277
Wait, no! I'm not done guessing!

391
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,715
Come on, enough about me.

392
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,836
What do you play?

393
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,272
You wanna be a hortomacultural what?

394
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,670
A horticulturalist. You know,
someone who works with plants.

395
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,116
- Right. (laughs)
- Why is that funny?

396
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,830
No, plants are great.
I just thought of you as, like, a cop.

397
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,559
You've got
the whole interrogation thing down.

398
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,029
Shut up. It's your move.

399
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,475
(chuckles) Alright. Erm...

400
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,471
- Oh, you really don't wanna do that.
- (sighs) Why not?

401
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,915
- I'll kill her.
- What if I asked you not to?

402
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,151
I'd still kill her.
You'd sort of be begging me to.

403
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,758
So, beer. You've never had a beer?

404
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,990
- I've had a beer.
- On tap?

405
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,674
- No, not on tap.
- Then you've never had a beer.

406
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,876
- Your knight can't do that.
- My knight?

407
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,758
- The horse.
- Alright.

408
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,952
Hey, how about you and me

409
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,679
heading down to the Cloverdilly pub
right now?

410
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,469
- The Cloverdilly pub?
- Yeah. Best beer, best blues,

411
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,519
- some of the best beer bums in town.
- Thanks. Maybe later.

412
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,672
(whispers) Penelope, come on.

413
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,430
- Hey?
- (bangs glass)

414
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,432
Come on, you've gotta get out
of there sometime.

415
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,919
Right?

416
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,591
What are you waiting for?

417
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,637
Aah.

418
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,956
You know, truth is,...
you're not missing much.

419
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,596
Really? The Cloverdilly pub sounds fun.

420
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,989
Yeah, but aside from that.

421
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,390
And the street fairs? I hear
they sell cool stuff on the street.

422
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,631
You know, the vendors themselves
are pretty cool, too.

423
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,598
- Oh, and the park?
- The park is great.

424
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,670
I used to spend every weekend there,

425
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,638
just hanging on a bench
writing stupid love songs,

426
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,837
- people watching.
- Used to? You don't do that any more?

427
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,433
- No.
- What are you doing instead?

428
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,069
Well,... beating you at chess.

429
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,480
- I warned you I'd kill her.
- That's great.

430
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,676
When my guys see what you've done...

431
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,958
- lt'll be over. Your queen'll be dead.
- My king's still pretty active.

432
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,713
Once the queen's dead,
the king's useless.

433
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,870
- What's that about?
- I don't know.

434
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,548
Maybe he's too depressed to fight.
He really loved her, you know?

435
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,792
Yeah, I can see that.

436
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,119
- My queen to yours, checkmate.
- You got me.

437
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,115
(investigator) What is this guy doing?

438
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,509
Wasting all my film.

439
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,032
He's doing it on purpose.
He's going for the dowry.

440
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,157
(investigator) I wish I could find
a girl with a dowry.

441
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,758
- Give me a break.
- Why else would it take you so long?

442
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,149
She revealed herself to me
straight away.

443
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,470
You know what?
I guess she liked you more.

444
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,273
Why settle for 5,000
when you could get ten times that?

445
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,478
Well, maybe you're forgetting,
I've seen her. She is grotesque.

446
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,199
- Shut him up.
- I'm talking unkissable ugly.

447
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,068
- Nightmare ugly. Puke...
- Listen to me, you little worm.

448
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,153
I know your kind. Spoilt-rotten
momma's boy with nothing....

449
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,231
God! He licked me.

450
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,753
- Edward.
- What?

451
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,673
- Don't lick Max.
- Sorry.

452
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,796
You can't blame us for being suspicious.

453
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,393
Fine, find someone else.

454
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,675
(Edward) Fine, give us back the money.

455
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,711
- It's starting! It's starting!
- Wait, wait, wait.

456
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,190
(Penelope) OK, I've got it. Piano.

457
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,794
You play the piano. I bet my life on it.

458
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,233
Alright, keep in mind,
never bet a better.

459
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,995
Does he have another jacket?

460
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,630
And a one and a two and a one.

461
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,111
- # You are my sunshine
- (plays wrong chord)

462
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,794
- # My only sunshine
- (plays wrong chord)

463
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,917
- # You make me happy
- (plays wrong chord)

464
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,913
- # When skies are grey
- (Penelope) No, it's B-flat.

465
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,594
(laughs) # You are my sunshine

466
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,913
- (Penelope) B-flat on the right hand.
- # My only sunshine

467
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,230
(Penelope) No, right hand!

468
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,589
- # You are my sunshine
- (plays wrong chord)

469
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,036
What? # My only sunshine

470
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,951
# You make me... You're my...

471
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,477
(Penelope) The left hand stays,
and the right hand plays the chord.

472
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,109
- # You are my...
- (plays correct chord)

473
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,233
- You see?
- Yeah, yeah. It's better. Whoa!

474
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,959
(glass smashes)

475
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,156
- (camera clicks)
- Shh...

476
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,755
- I'm a monster.
- No, no, you're not. Penelope!

477
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,159
No!

478
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,599
Penelope! Stay with Max.

479
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,595
- Darling, do not, please, do not...
- I told you! I told you!

480
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,911
- No, you ran! It was you this time.
- He just stood there,

481
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,958
staring at me. No one's ever
just stood there before.

482
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,679
Did you give the poor boy
a chance to adjust?

483
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,513
I mean, put yourself in...

484
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,194
What are you doing?
I told you to stay with him!

485
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,555
(Wanda) I didn't hear you.
I didn't hear you.

486
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,033
- Did you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

487
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,912
Whoa! Hey, I needed that photo!

488
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,798
She's not what Edward said she was.
Leave her alone.

489
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,989
Lemon?

490
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,074
- (gasps)
- (Wanda) Who is that?

491
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,118
- Lock the gate!
- No, don't shut the gate!

492
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,834
(both scream)

493
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,833
(Wanda) I got him!

494
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,319
- Penelope?
- Max?

495
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,470
There's something I have to tell you.

496
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,516
- No, he's a spy!
- No, yes, but...

497
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,388
He's a spy working for Lemon!
The reporter who forced me to bury you.

498
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,550
- You said I was cremated.
- That, too.

499
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,598
I hope you were well paid.
You just lost a fortune!

500
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,990
(Wanda) Wait! He's still a blue blood.
He could break the curse!

501
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,112
Max, I know that this face repulses you

502
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,351
and I wouldn't dream of asking you
to accept it.

503
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,795
- No, no, Penelope.
- But this isn't me.

504
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,668
The real me is inside here somewhere
just waiting to get out.

505
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,910
And you can make that happen.

506
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,037
Once the curse is broken,
I'll be just like anybody else.

507
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,591
What if the curse isn't broken? What
if... the curse can never be broken?

508
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,434
Then I'll kill myself.
I promise. I promise I will.

509
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,558
Marry me, Max.

510
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,990
Marry me!

511
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,112
I can't.

512
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,599
Get out.

513
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,475
- I'm...
- (Jessica) Get out! Get out!

514
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,596
Right out!

515
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,390
(Penelope) I felt the rush
of a thousand heartbreaks.

516
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,192
But it took my mother
just ten seconds to...

517
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,998
OK, this is what we're gonna do.

518
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,117
- (Wanda) What? You really...
- (Jessica) Just hear me out.

519
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,988
Penelope? Penelope! This is nothing
we haven't been through before!

520
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,355
Penelope?
I will never give up, sweetheart.

521
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,272
Never, Penelope!

522
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,959
Never, Penelope!

523
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,675
(Penelope) And I knew,
with all my heart, she meant it.

524
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,193
(Jessica) Never!

525
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,155
(plays chord)

526
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,998
(plays melancholy tune)

527
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,792
OK, that's it for me, folks.
New dealer coming in.

528
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,393
(Franklin) We've prepared her
for the day things would be different.

529
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,597
We've never prepared her
for the day that they're not.

530
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,118
Maybe we should stop all this
match-making and... give her a puppy.

531
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,915
- (creaking)
- Sweetheart? Penelope, is that you?

532
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,594
Yes, Mother.
I'm just going to make some cocoa.

533
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,908
OK.

534
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,678
A puppy?

535
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,191
- What can I say?
- Don't.

536
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,750
I'm sorry you got stuck with me.
I'm sorry I dragged you down with me!

537
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,752
I know I'm the bad blood!
You don't think I know that?

538
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,638
I'm the Wilhern! The curse is on me!
I am the curse!

539
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,154
It's me, me! I am the curse!
It's me, me, me!

540
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,074
Honey. Honey! I think your father
could use some cocoa, too!

541
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,998
OK, Mother.

542
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,113
Actually, I might have a cup, too.

543
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,031
Penelope?

544
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,079
(yells) Penelope!

545
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,513
Wow!

546
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,316
- (Edward) She's escaped.
- Let's go!

547
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,630
- She's gonna come after me!
- Edward, get control of yourself!

548
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,948
Quick!

549
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,152
(hubbub)

550
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,311
- What are you doing?
- We need help.

551
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,550
I'd like to report my daughter missing.

552
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,030
- Are you mad? What if they find her?
- For crying out loud!

553
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,918
(chatter)

554
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,319
(jaunty tune)

555
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,038
(bicycle bell rings)

556
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,077
(children laugh)

557
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,358
OK. I can't hold it any longer.
Come with me.

558
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,000
I have to pee.
I can't leave you with the phones.

559
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,356
(phone rings)

560
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,028
- Hello?
- Mom?

561
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,032
- (operator) Hold the line, please.
- Mom?

562
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,236
- Collect call...
- We'll accept.

563
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,470
- Go ahead with your call, please.
- Hello?

564
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,711
What the hell were you thinking?
Did anyone see you yet?

565
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,916
- No, Mom.
- Good, good. Where are you?

566
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,798
- We'll come and get you.
- I'm just calling to say

567
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,475
that I love you, and... goodbye.

568
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,551
Penelope, don't...

569
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,116
At least we know she's alright.

570
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,600
- (woman) Thank you.
- (man) Good evening, madam.

571
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,509
Hi. Erm,... can I have a room, please?

572
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,592
Shouldn't be a problem.
Room eight is available.

573
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,195
- Thank you.
- You don't want the room?

574
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,072
No, I, I want the room.

575
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,232
Then would you mind coming back here
so I can check you in?

576
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,514
Oh.

577
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,311
Thank you. And how will you be
paying for your room?

578
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,436
Thank you, Jessica.

579
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,955
- (Edward) Nostrils are bigger.
- (Lemon) We've got to wrap this up.

580
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,758
We've gotta go to print.

581
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,832
More piggy, really. Erm, and a...

582
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,634
Thank you, ma'am. Gentlemen.

583
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,790
How's everybody doing this fine day?

584
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,751
- I thought you went home.
- I did.

585
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,991
Slept for eight blissful hours,
fixed the kids' breakfast,

586
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,672
kissed the wife goodbye,

587
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,070
and, according to the button,
it's your blind.

588
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,392
Are you in or out?

589
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,914
(dealer) He's still got chips. He's in.

590
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,829
(man) Give him some time.
He's still got chips. He'll come around.

591
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,718
(voices echo)

592
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,119
(player) I'll take another.
Make it a large one.

593
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,397
(dealer) He's still got chips. He's in.

594
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,629
(pants)

595
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,438
- Your morning paper, madam.
- Oh, thanks, Jake.

596
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,310
Holy Magda!

597
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,549
(thud)

598
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,278
- Damn it, Edward!
- Dad, they all think I'm crazy.

599
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,238
And this helps you? How?

600
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,437
You told me to...
I thought this would prove...

601
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,471
Try to remember I'm your son.

602
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,472
That's exactly
what I'm trying to forget!

603
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,278
For starters, I'm going to need
a recent photograph.

604
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,396
- No photographs.
- None whatsoever?

605
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,233
No. The, er, fire got them.

606
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,390
OK, er, a detailed description?

607
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,069
- Brown hair.
- Hm-hmm.

608
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,879
- Brown eyes.
- Hm-hmm.

609
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,872
A unique...Iy pleasant personality.

610
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,110
Think pig.

611
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,919
- So she's a fat girl?
- Does any of this matter?

612
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,513
Just go find her!

613
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,479
Our daughter's out there somewhere,
lost and afraid...

614
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,595
(muffled scream)

615
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,876
(detective) I've got nothing to go on.

616
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,678
No photographs, no friends,

617
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,513
- no job, no hangouts.
- Something like this.

618
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,636
- But minus the fangs.
- Franklin!

619
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,915
Do you want to find her or not?

620
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,790
Minus the fangs.
They're certainly eye-grabbing.

621
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,952
(Jessica) You know what? Never mind.
How much do we owe you?

622
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,158
Where's my...? Who took my wallet?

623
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,718
(Franklin) It's our daughter.
Please help us.

624
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,438
Please, I'm begging you.

625
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,875
What he's trying to say is,
give us the key now!

626
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,359
(receptionist) I'm sorry.

627
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,795
The room is registered in my name
with my card.

628
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,189
Who's the guest? Me.
That makes me the guest.

629
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,191
(pants)

630
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,514
Well, at least we know
she's not starving.

631
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,634
No, not just... not just any pig.

632
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,996
OK. OK, yeah.
You need to stop talking now.

633
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,991
(phone rings)

634
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,036
Hello?

635
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,076
Yeah, that's right.

636
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,674
- Penelope?
- Who is this?

637
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,397
That was Penelope on the... on the...

638
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,910
- Sell her own picture?
- Hmm.

639
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,030
Er, then why did you hang up?

640
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,635
Edward, what's wrong with you?
Did you ever...?

641
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,349
- (phone rings)
- Oh, God.

642
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,716
- Penelope.
- How did you know it was me?

643
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,872
Just a lucky guess. You have
something you want to sell us?

644
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,997
- That's right.
- May I ask why you are doing this?

645
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,469
What do you care?
You're getting your freak.

646
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,074
Hey, nobody said anything
about a freak.

647
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,596
- Listen, do you want it or not?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

648
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,433
Thank you. Er, OK.

649
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,072
OK. OK.

650
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,435
OK. OK. OK.

651
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,074
(gasps)

652
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,593
- Look, Grandma, a pig!
- How nice.

653
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,999
Oh!

654
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,830
Fangs?

655
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,948
There are no fangs.

656
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,231
Huh.

657
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,359
Well, she must just suck them back
into her skull or someth...

658
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,635
Edward, you know, I've been thinking.

659
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,995
I know and you know.
Maybe that's enough.

660
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:24,676
Lemon, half the people in this city
think I'm crazy.

661
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,908
I've got to prove to them that I'm not.

662
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,319
I'm sorry. I've got to do it.

663
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:38,269
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the pig-faced girl!

664
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,716
(whimpers)

665
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,714
You weren't kidding!

666
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,068
- Can I get you something?
- Can I have a beer on tap, please?

667
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,958
Sure. You can have this one.

668
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,030
- You're supposed to catch it.
- Oh, sorry.

669
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,153
Are you ready now?

670
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,791
- There you go.
- Thank you.

671
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:32,155
- Is there a problem?
- Do you have any straws?

672
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,389
Sure.

673
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,388
There you go.

674
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,159
That's half.
You'll get the rest when I'm ready.

675
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,073
- Let's just call it even.
- No, let's not!

676
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,714
- She's not some freaking payday.
- She sold me the photo herself.

677
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:05,150
Yeah. Apparently, she's out there on
her own, declaring her independence.

678
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,872
(elevator bell)

679
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,508
- (laughter)
- (woman) Hey, Jack. Lucky you.

680
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,279
- Last delivery of the day.
- How are you doing?

681
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,430
You wanna know
or are you just asking?

682
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,953
I'm just asking.

683
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,715
So, I'm driving my Vespa, and this
guy comes out of nowhere and hits me.

684
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,430
I go flying, I'm in the street
and he goes, "Sorry, I didn't see you."

685
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,273
How can he not see me?
I'm on a Vespa with wings.

686
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,318
I mean, right, you can see me.
You can see me, right?

687
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,277
- Hmm.
- (woman) What?

688
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,318
- Yes.
- See? She can see me.

689
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,710
- You gotta stick Billy on him.
- It's a little too late.

690
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,678
You've got to sign here.
Billy moved back to the 'burbs.

691
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,149
- Yeah? Sorry to hear it.
- Yeah.

692
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,630
(woman) We didn't belong together.
He was a picket-fence kinda guy.

693
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,393
What guy looks at me
and thinks picket fence?

694
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,393
Unless he's crazy, and I'm done
dating crazy, you know? Done.

695
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,630
- Unless it's meant to be. Right?
- Yeah.

696
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,676
- Right?
- Right.

697
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,274
I can't hear you
with that thing on your face.

698
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,316
Hm-hmm.

699
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,154
- The usual. On the house.
- Thanks, Jack.

700
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,674
- You're the best.
- Cheers.

701
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,353
Are you hiding from the law
or is that a bad nose job?

702
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,318
Hm-hmm. Bad nose job.

703
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,999
Do you mind me asking how much
that might cost somebody, a nose job?

704
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,196
- Oh, nothing.
- Free?

705
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,669
- Hm-hmm.
- Huh.

706
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,548
I was just thinking about getting
a little work done myself.

707
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,073
A nose job?

708
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,197
Yeah, kind of,
but for my ears, you know?

709
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,511
They stick out a little on the top.
I'm no Penelope, but...

710
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,716
You have beautiful ears. Beautiful.

711
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,870
- They're beautiful!
- Are you drunk?

712
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,916
- I'm drunk!
- Oh.

713
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,757
Jack, how about another round
for my pal, Scarfy, here?

714
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,558
(Jack) Coming up.

715
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,791
What's a Vespa?

716
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,838
What's a Ve...?
You've never ridden on a Vespa?

717
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,674
- Hey, Sam, long time no see.
- Wow, look who's back.

718
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,275
Look, er, have you
seen the guys around?

719
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,909
They're touring, opening for some
band who's supposed to be good.

720
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,117
- No kidding? That's great.
- What brings you back here?

721
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,475
Oh, you know, looking around.

722
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,390
Actually, I thought it was maybe time
I started playing again.

723
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,552
- Yeah? Well, good luck with that.
- Yeah.

724
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,756
Sam, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't...

725
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,834
You are joking, ain't you? After all
your no-shows? I only look stupid.

726
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,675
Look, I messed up.
I know, and I'm sorry.

727
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,394
I didn't appreciate a good thing
when I had it.

728
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,473
- Oh, and now you do?
- Now I do.

729
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,038
(plays piano)

730
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,555
- Still got your scarf on?
- Yeah.

731
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,313
Alright, hop on.

732
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,873
# And here comes the night
pulling puppet strings

733
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,111
# On my heart again

734
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,429
# Shows me all of this time
I've been blind

735
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,433
- # To this waking life
- No, no, no.

736
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:56,235
# Now I see it everywhere
- Alright, I gotta go down there.

737
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,995
# Cos I'm not lost

738
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,471
# Just looking for footprints, yeah

739
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,994
# And I'm taking it

740
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,548
# One day at a time

741
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:14,316
# And I'm getting by and by the way

742
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,960
(plays piano)

743
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,433
# You're still on my mind

744
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,114
- (plays piano)
- Oi! Mozart!

745
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,072
Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

746
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,430
Don't muck about.

747
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,436
- Another postcard.
- I don't care. What's it say?

748
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,715
- "Went ice skating."
- Stop. I don't care.

749
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,030
- Circus.
- It's been weeks.

750
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,235
Zoo.

751
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,232
How could she do all these things
without being seen?

752
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,790
- She can't! That's how!
- She can't be far.

753
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,314
We just have to keep looking.

754
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,238
My brother once
was just riding his bicycle,

755
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,595
and he hit this parked car,
and he was...

756
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,353
Look, Helleborus orientalis.

757
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,113
They're amazing.
They bloom even in the winter.

758
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,838
Oh, that's cool.

759
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,798
They just pop up
without any help from anyone.

760
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,555
Ha! Sounds like my ex-boyfriend,
if you know what I mean.

761
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,278
Oh, yeah.

762
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,113
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yeah.

763
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,952
Really?

764
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,951
You don't get out much, do you?

765
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,956
We should talk.

766
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,718
- That's her scarf! Look!
- Penelope!

767
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,234
- Penelope!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

768
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,991
No, she went that...!

769
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,955
(pants)

770
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,759
Oh, great. You're here.
It's your turn to buy.

771
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,398
Alright, I lied. I'll buy.

772
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,795
- Oh, my God!
- (anxious chatter)

773
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,670
Get the scarf off her.
She can't breathe.

774
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,795
No! No!

775
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,398
Hey.

776
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,276
Penelope!

777
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,909
(excited chatter)

778
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,671
(Penelope) They're not running.

779
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,398
- There she is!
- Penelope, this way! This way!

780
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,550
(excited chatter)

781
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,191
Is it true you were chained up
in the basement?

782
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,077
Don't encourage them.

783
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,116
- Do you have other pig parts?
- No!

784
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,397
With your large nose,
do you smell better than the rest of us?

785
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,233
I don't know. You tell me.

786
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,355
- Penelope!
- Annie!

787
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,989
- Mom, can I borrow some money?
- Absolutely not! Get in that car.

788
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,072
After three weeks, I was like...
I knew something was up.

789
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,798
Nose jobs only take so long.

790
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,111
Mom, they wanna know if you
chained me up in the basement.

791
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,872
(laughs)

792
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,757
Go on the bike.

793
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,559
No, of course not.

794
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,959
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.

795
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,032
Is there anything
you'd like to say to the public?

796
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,917
Er,... hi.

797
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,552
(all shout) Mr Vanderman!

798
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,837
Did you attempt to file
assault charges against Penelope?

799
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,230
- I've obtained the police report.
- No comment, please, no comment.

800
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:13,519
I can handle it, Dad. That woman,
that thing, belongs in a cage.

801
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,236
- (woman) What a creep!
- Excuse me.

802
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,629
(reporters shout)

803
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,434
- Have you lost your mind?
- You saw her.

804
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,557
- She's a complete monster.
- The public loves this girl.

805
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,871
- They don't know her.
- We're a publicly traded company.

806
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,190
We love what the public loves. Get it?

807
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,794
- So, what are you saying?
- I'm saying you've got to fix this!

808
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,797
- (Edward) What do you expect me...
- (Vanderman) Just fix it!

809
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,633
- (man) Penelope, you're on my team!
- (Penelope) OK. I'm not very good.

810
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,473
Penelope! Penelope! Penelope!

811
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,312
Come on, bull's-eye!

812
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,073
(cheering)

813
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,915
- Come on, come on.
- (glass smashes)

814
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,514
(cheering)

815
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,795
I told you I wasn't very good.

816
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,471
- Hi.
- Hi.

817
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,269
Wow! You really did it, huh?

818
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,390
I mean, er... I mean, er...

819
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,634
You look great, you know?
Really happy.

820
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,392
Thanks.

821
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,072
Yeah.

822
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,754
You know, you inspired me.

823
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,595
Doing what you did, going off
on your own like that. I, er, I'm not...

824
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,392
- I have to go.
- Yeah, sure. I, er...

825
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,633
I just...

826
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,437
(reporters) Penelope.
Penelope. Penelope!

827
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,636
Darling, I'm so glad I found you!
You must come home right now!

828
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,950
I have the most wonderful surprise.

829
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,759
- (Penelope) OK, but I should get back.
- Penelope.

830
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,795
What is this?

831
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,237
Listen, I'm... sorry
I ran... from my feelings.

832
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,515
Oh, is that what you were running from?

833
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,989
I was certain you were running from me.

834
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,356
- Only my feelings for you.
- (Penelope) Is this a joke?

835
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,351
Penelope, don't make the boy beg.

836
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,193
Look at that face.
He can break the curse.

837
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,271
(Penelope) Things are different now.

838
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,510
She's overwhelmed.

839
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,919
Why? Because
you're all over the newspapers?

840
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,877
No, because I have friends.

841
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,315
Those aren't friends, dear.
Those are fans.

842
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,439
"Did you hear? The pig speaks ten
languages. The pig plays the piano."

843
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,080
You're just a talking pig
to those people.

844
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,071
A talking pig.

845
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,671
Edward wants to marry you.

846
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,035
Are you prepared to walk away
from your one and only chance,

847
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,998
our one and only chance,
of a normal life?

848
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,557
Will you marry me,... Penelope?

849
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,196
- (tap at door)
- (Larry) Hey, Lemon.

850
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,508
Yeah?

851
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:19,628
I thought you might be able to help me
with this Max Campion story I'm doing.

852
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,472
Well, what's the story?

853
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,189
I'm doing this kind of
riches-to-rags-to-armed-robbery story.

854
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,430
Armed robbery?
Come on, Max Campion?

855
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,398
Yeah. I just got the call.
He's already confessed.

856
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,994
What?

857
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,598
Pick it up.

858
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,677
- You're the lawyer my mother sent?
- There's been a mistake.

859
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,399
- I'm here to see Max Campion.
- I'm Max Campion.

860
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,118
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

861
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,954
- No, Max Campion.
- I am not deaf. I can hear you.

862
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,349
I am Max Campion.

863
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,992
But you're...

864
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,877
(Lemon) You got a Maxwell Campion
playing here tonight?

865
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,112
- (man) That's him. Table number five.
- You got the wrong guy.

866
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,110
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Ah?

867
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,760
- (laughs)
- OK. OK.

868
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:25,119
OK, OK, no. No. What about the guy
you play poker with?

869
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:32,038
Er... Shaggy hair, er, medium build.
Doesn't know when to quit.

870
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,078
Ah! Er, Johnny Martin.

871
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,913
- Johnny Martin?
- Johnny Martin. Poor loser.

872
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:42,149
Get that down, Martin,
in the pirate pad there.

873
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,753
Oh, that was so wonderful, just
wonderful. Was it not wonderful?

874
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,512
- Yes.
- Yes, it was wonderful.

875
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,830
We have to do this again,
and you know what?

876
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,639
Now we're nearly family,
this is just the beginning.

877
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,109
- I'll fetch the limo.
- Good, good, good.

878
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,111
Can I have my coat, please?

879
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,953
We used to go to the theatre
all the time. Why did we stop?

880
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,156
I guess because
we had an ugly daughter.

881
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,994
- Let me help you with that, sir.
- Thank you.

882
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,709
- It's just over there.
- OK, we're going.

883
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,519
- (Penelope) But my coat!
- We'll get you another one.

884
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,114
Edward, what are you doing?
Where are we going?

885
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,555
- Hi.
- Max.

886
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,029
- Hello, Penelope.
- We were just leaving.

887
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,839
- Hey, how are things, Edward?
- Keep walking.

888
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,509
I understand it got a bit grotesque
there for a while. Even puke ugly.

889
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,795
- You two know each other?
- Yes, we do.

890
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,270
- Yale, wasn't it?
- No, I believe it was at Bedford.

891
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:43,797
- A Bedford van to be...
- Stop! Haven't you hurt her enough?

892
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,836
- Bathroom. Now.
- Edward, l...

893
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,957
- Penelope, let Edward handle this.
- But, Mother...

894
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,951
- You make me sick!
- Why?

895
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,237
I'm giving her exactly what she wants.
Aren't l?

896
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,198
And I don't see anybody else
lining up to do that.

897
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,556
- Unless you are. Are you lining up?
- That's not the point.

898
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,438
- That's not the point.
- Yes, it is the point!

899
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,988
Look, if you want to go out there
and tell her

900
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:09,038
that the only man willing to stand up
and say "l do"

901
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:14,399
still gags at the thought
of kissing her, then be my guest.

902
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,755
But it's not me you'll be hurting.

903
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,400
It's her, isn't it?

904
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,350
Johnny Martin.

905
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,437
- (laughs)
- Son of a plumber, huh?

906
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,034
It sure took you long enough.

907
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,910
(Lemon) Boy, you fooled me.

908
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,193
So, it looks like you were
doing her a favour after all.

909
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:58,277
- You seen this?
- Hmm. Cute couple.

910
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,191
Yeah. Penelope and the beast.

911
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,919
They're both getting
what they want, right?

912
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,833
I know what he's getting.
What's she getting?

913
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,878
She's getting the day
she's waited for all her life,

914
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,076
- breaking the curse.
- (laughs)

915
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,429
Oh, you don't actually believe that,
do you?

916
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,317
- Don't you?
- No.

917
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,994
No? What have you been chasing
all these years?

918
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:23,392
I don't know. A wounded ego
and a missing eye, I guess.

919
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,598
- Hmm.
- It's not too late to stop Edward.

920
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,750
That's what she wants.

921
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,593
Wait. If getting married is all it takes
to break the, ooh, the curse,

922
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,113
why not you?

923
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,589
- You're forgetting, I'm not Max.
- So?

924
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,639
One of their own kind.
I'm not a blue blood.

925
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,791
Hey! Over here!
I saved you a seat! It's clean.

926
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,440
Hey, Annie, look at you!

927
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,152
- Weddings are great.
- Yeah. When they're somebody else's.

928
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,719
Yeah.

929
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,789
And Edward seems really nice,
you know?

930
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,677
Mum, I think I'm going to throw up.

931
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,311
Just remember, in a few minutes
from now, the curse will be broken.

932
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,109
There is no curse!
The only one cursed here is me.

933
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:37,314
- Jessica, I need a word.
- What's the matter?

934
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,597
- For starters...
- Losing your eye was your own fault.

935
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,114
- Now what?
- I just wanted to apologise.

936
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,555
Apology not accepted.

937
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,629
What? I have a wedding to go to!

938
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,192
Meet Johnny Martin.

939
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:06,512
- I told you not to rush the process.
- This doesn't change a thing.

940
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,478
How can you say that?
Not only was Edward part of it...

941
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,994
As you once said,
he's still one of her own kind.

942
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:15,197
OK, fine. What about Max or Johnny
or whatever his name is?

943
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,118
- What about him?
- lsn't Penelope entitled to know?

944
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,715
- That he lied about everything?
- That he can't break the curse!

945
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,075
Why on earth
would she need to know that?

946
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,789
Don't you see? Maybe
that's the only reason he said no!

947
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,996
I don't know that. You don't know that.

948
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,516
But if that's true, God bless him,
he did the right thing!

949
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,119
- Damn it, Jessica, I can't let you...
- Leave it alone.

950
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,194
I think I'm nervous.
Not that I'm not happy for her.

951
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,919
I'm happy for her.
You're happy for her, right?

952
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,877
If she's happy, I'm happy, yeah.

953
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,193
- Mom, I feel stupid.
- Oh, you don't look stupid.

954
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,589
You look...

955
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,591
You don't look stupid.

956
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,111
Do you, Edward Vanderman,

957
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,876
take Penelope Wilhern
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

958
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,315
for better or for worse,

959
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,675
for richer or for poorer,

960
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,957
in sickness and in health,

961
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,508
to love and to cherish

962
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,434
from this day forward
until death do you part?

963
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,997
I do.

964
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,270
And do you, Penelope Wilhern,

965
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,158
take Edward Humphrey Vanderman lll

966
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,674
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

967
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,750
to have and to hold,

968
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,990
for better or for worse,

969
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,036
for richer or for poorer,

970
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,190
in sickness and in health,

971
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,478
to love and to cherish
from this day forward

972
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,438
until death do you part?

973
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,592
Penelope?

974
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,115
No.

975
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,679
No!

976
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:31,194
Nobody move! She's fine!
Penelope, wait.

977
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,472
- Look at me.
- I am. What is it, dear?

978
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:39,155
- No, look at me!
- I am! What? I don't understand!

979
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,952
I'm sorry.

980
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,870
Penelope, it's not too late.

981
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,157
- Go away, Mother!
- Think about what you're doing.

982
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,879
This is the moment
we have worked so hard for.

983
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,678
I said go away!

984
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,320
Sweetheart, please!

985
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,631
Please! We are one yes away
from a whole new life!

986
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,269
- A whole new you!
- But I don't want a whole new me!

987
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,828
Sweetheart, please! Please!

988
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,832
I like myself the way I am.

989
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,754
(gasps)

990
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,592
Penelope?

991
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,157
Mom?

992
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,199
(typewriters click)

993
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,918
(Penelope) The curse was so simple.

994
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,355
Me. One of my own kind.

995
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,078
I'd had the power all along.

996
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,036
It's not going to grow back.

997
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,356
- What makes you think l...
- I miss it, too.

998
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,477
And then I remember you're still you.

999
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,309
(sighs) Penelope.

1000
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,829
One of your own kind. I just assumed...

1001
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,559
- No, we all did, Mother.
- No, dear.

1002
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,030
No. Don't you see?
I could've broken the curse years ago

1003
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:08,079
if I'd just done my job as your mother,
and loved you as my own.

1004
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:11,516
- You didn't know. You didn't know.
- (sobs)

1005
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,638
Dad.

1006
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,072
Oh.

1007
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,398
Oh, look. (laughs)

1008
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,510
You know, darling,
with the carotid artery out of the way,

1009
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:36,388
I think a little turn-up right there
would be sweet, wouldn't it?

1010
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,436
Look at that. What?

1011
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,197
You're crazy.

1012
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,832
Oh, it's wrong for a young woman
to wanna look her best?

1013
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,911
That's not a bad thing.

1014
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,913
What? I'm being her mother!
That's what mothers do with daughters!

1015
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,036
They talk about how to look prettier!

1016
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,032
Still, I felt sad for my mother
that day.

1017
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,031
Oh, now I'm the bad guy!

1018
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,396
Having to cope with so many changes
all at once.

1019
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:08,110
I was packing to go,
and after 25 years with the family...

1020
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,510
Jake, where are you going?
Jake, I'm talking to you. Jake?

1021
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,433
And why do you have that bag?
Jake? Don't be rude!

1022
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,398
Turn around when I'm talking to you!
I happen to be...

1023
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,198
(silence)

1024
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,030
Turns out Jake had a secret of his own.

1025
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,712
(Franklin) What happened?

1026
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:28,396
And figured we all might be better off
if my mother kept quiet for a while.

1027
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,919
There, there, now. There, there.

1028
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,030
(thunder)

1029
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,228
But I had my own changes
to cope with.

1030
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,270
While I missed the face
that had caused so much trouble,...

1031
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,031
.. the world had moved on.

1032
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,270
And I was determined
to find my own way,

1033
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:23,716
- to always follow my heart.
- (boy) My daffodil bloomed!

1034
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,678
(girl) I found Helleborus orientalis!

1035
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,037
And then came Halloween.

1036
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,793
Line up by the front door
as quick as possible.

1037
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,189
- (children argue)
- Hey! No fighting.

1038
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:37,670
- (girl) Let go! It's my mask!
- (Penelope) Girls, please.

1039
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,716
But she knew I was gonna be Penelope.

1040
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:46,388
Alright, girls, you're gonna have to
go out with the rest of the class.

1041
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:50,439
Go line up. Come on. Line up.
Get ready to go. Come on.

1042
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,279
Alice? Honey, what's wrong?

1043
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:59,388
Everybody's Penelope,
and I'm a stupid static cling!

1044
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,631
Oh. Well, frankly,
I find you quite refreshing.

1045
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:06,395
Come on, sweetie. Stick with me
and we'll both make it through this.

1046
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,756
(all) Trick or treat?

1047
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,274
Well, hello there.

1048
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,715
- (girl) I love this one!
- (Franklin) Jess!

1049
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,190
- You're gonna wanna see this.
- (girl) Is this too much?

1050
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,669
And then Wanda couldn't hold on
to the secret any longer.

1051
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,909
(rock music)

1052
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,757
Wow! You're everywhere.
Are you freaking out or what?

1053
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,353
- OK, 357.
- There it is.

1054
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,350
- Hold on.
- (laughs)

1055
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,510
- What?
- (laughs)

1056
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,114
It's just kinda great
to see the old you.

1057
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,555
- OK. Alright, let's go.
- Here we go.

1058
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,038
You can do this. Are you ready?

1059
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,472
(Annie knocks on door)

1060
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,668
Hi. Erm,... I...

1061
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,275
She's gotta pee. You got a bathroom?
I'm gonna get some punch.

1062
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,634
No!

1063
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:28,876
Er, yeah. Yeah, sure.
I guess it's OK. Come on in.

1064
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,355
(Penelope) It looks like a good party.

1065
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,912
- Why aren't you at the party?
- I gotta pack.

1066
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,308
So, are you moving?

1067
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,760
Er, out-of-town job. I felt like
getting out of the city for a while.

1068
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,631
(Penelope) Away from the crowds?

1069
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,474
(laughs) Yeah, the crowds
at the poker tables.

1070
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,391
Oh, so you're a gambler?

1071
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:05,189
Ex. Avoiding temptation.

1072
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,675
Well, that's good.

1073
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,351
Good for you.

1074
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,988
I, er, I had a friend once
who liked to gamble.

1075
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,877
Well, I heard he liked to gamble,

1076
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,633
and he had to stay away
from all kinds of things...

1077
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,438
Take off the mask.

1078
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,159
What?

1079
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,118
I'm sorry.

1080
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:37,395
All Halloween, I've been running
into, well, someone I used to know.

1081
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,956
I'm sorry. Ridiculous.

1082
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:49,029
This someone,...
she meant a lot to you?

1083
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,598
Yes.

1084
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,553
Yes, she did.

1085
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,752
What happened?

1086
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,395
I couldn't give her what she wanted.

1087
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,271
What did she want?

1088
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,678
To be free.

1089
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,870
You lied to me! I guessed piano,
and you said that...

1090
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,951
- Penelope, I'm sorry.
- I know.

1091
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,679
No. I don't have the power
to break the curse.

1092
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:35,351
It's OK. It turns out I did.

1093
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,757
It's me, Max.

1094
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,038
My name's Johnny.

1095
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,995
I know. Johnny.

1096
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,116
I'm still me.

1097
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,436
So, there we were.

1098
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,880
And we lived happily ever after.

1099
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,231
Well, happily ever after
so far, at least.

1100
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,709
I don't get it. What does it mean?

1101
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,916
Well, what do you think it means?

1102
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,752
(boy) Rich people stink!

1103
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:18,719
- It's always the mother's fault.
- (laughs)

1104
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,749
It's not the power of the curse,
it's the power you give the curse.

1105
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,871
That's very good, Billy.

1106
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,431
OK, after break, we'll go explore,
and see what you can collect.

1107
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,868
Stay together!

1108
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,237
(Johnny) Jump on.

1109
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,831
- Ready?
- Not too high.

1110
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,674
(Johnny) Higher? Yeah!
