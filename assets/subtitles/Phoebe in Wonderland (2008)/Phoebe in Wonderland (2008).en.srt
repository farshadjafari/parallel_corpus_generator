<i>(glrl)
I'm here to try out

185

I'm the Mad Hatter.

186
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,730
This is the March Hare,
and that's the Dormouse.

187
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:01,773
Whatever.

188
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,834
I want to be Alice,
and I always get the lead.

189
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,025
How strange everything is today.

190
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,426
Let me think.

191
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,794
Was I the same
when I got up this morning?

192
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,391
Thank you.

193
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,164
Wouldn't you like to attend
the party as the White Queen?

194
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,205
Alice.

195
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,603
Right.
Dive in.

196
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,537
[Dramatically]
How strange is everything today.

199
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,085
I'll make a killer Alice.

200
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,749
I look just like her.

201
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,760
Just Alice.

202
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,820
My daddy is sick rich.

203
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,025
I want Alice,

204
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,660
and you should know
that I'm a depressive.

205
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,563
No room, no room.

206
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,575
Excuse me?

207
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,838
Oh, may I have some tea?

208
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,951
Welcome to the tea party.

209
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,421
A gift?

210
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,117
Most recently,
I did two seasons

211
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,955

Theater Arts Workshop.

212
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,825
Indeed.

215
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,032
Hmm.

216
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,229
Which role would you like
to try out for,

217
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,705
the King of Hearts,
the White Knight?

218
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,167
The Queen of Hearts.

219
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,746
Unless...

220
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,644
No, no, no, no, no.

221
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,183
Please, be my guest.

222
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,414
Off with her head.

223
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:39,786
Phoebe Lichten?

224
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,061
Here.

225
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,261
Your tea party was scheduled
for 20 minutes ago.

226
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,371
"Your tea party was scheduled
for 20 minutes ago."

227
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,572
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

228
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,635
I was washing
my hands.

229
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,110
I suppose you want to read
for Alice.

230
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,714
Hmm.

231
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,025
How strange everything
is today.

232
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,063
Let me think.

233
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,496
Thank you.

234
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,129
- That's it?
- That's it.

235
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,865
You don't want me
to read anymore?

236
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,406
No, thank you.

237
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,876
Can I please try it again?

238
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,385
That won't be necessary.

239
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,854
I'm sorry I was late.
I really am.

240
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:38,890
<i>I had to...</i>

241
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:43,519
I have to wash my hands
a certain number of times.

242
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,771
You can try again,
a little slower.

243
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,949
[Voices whispering]

244
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,690
Go on.

245
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,786
Jump.

246
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:32,067
How strange everything is today.

247
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,908
Let me think.

248
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,279
Was I the same
when I got up this morning?

249
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,377
I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different.

250
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:48,290
But if I'm not the same,
the next question is,

251
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,727
who in the world am I?

252
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,844
How'd your tryouts go?

253
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,854
How'd you find me here?

254
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,389
<i>I made thls house.</i>

255
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,481
<i>It took a whlle.</i>

256
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,526
How'd it go?

257
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,100
I think mine went well.

258
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,834
I practiced forever.

259
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,240
I was better at home.

260
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,403
Auditions are stressful.

261
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,075
<i>When I wanted my baklng klt,</i>

262
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,242
I prayed to God every night
for a whole month to get it.

263
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,116
Is that what you have to do?

264
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,850
Well, if you want something a lot,
you have to pray

265
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,391
or do something you hate,

266
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,221
and God will see you deserve it.

267
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,128
I don't believe in God.

268
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,323
Me neither,

269
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,389
but I did get the baking kit.

270
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,433
So you have to pray?

271
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,469
<i>Or do somethlng you hate.</i>

272
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:06,905
Like what?

273
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,371
I don't know, P.E.?

274
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,407
P.E.?

275
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,907
But you have to choose
something else.

276
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,646
[Muffled clapping]

277
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,611

280

Did you have
your tryout today?

281
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,564
I'm concentrating.

Stop!

285
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,835
Now I can't remember
what number I'm on.

286
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,931
I have to start all over again.

287
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,669
Well, why don't you come inside?

288
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:50,238
I can't, not until I've stepped
on all the squares in the right order.

289
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:57,083
Are you, um, pretending
this is Looking Glass Land?

290
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,589
Looks a little like
a chessboard.

291
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,027
Phoebe, what would happen

292
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,363
if you didn't step on the squares
in the right order?

293
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,867
I won't get in the play.

294
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:15,805
That's what this is all about,
to get in the play?

295

<i>Get back!</i>

296
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,409
Can I help?

297
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,173
- Get back!
- Okay.

298

Have you been
acting differently recently?

You can say anything you want
to me, anything.

Nothing you say can be wrong.

322
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,046
In school, you have to follow
certain rules.

323

You can't speak
at certain times.

Here, it's the opposite.

I was so proud
of you today.

364

Good night.

365

Good night, love you.

366
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,976
Love you.

[Echoing laughter]

368
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,767
Are you asleep?

369
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:53,905
No.

370
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,003
So what do we do?

371
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,843
I don't know.

372
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,075
What do we do?

373
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,480
Are we gonna
do the play?

374
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,916
We are in a theater.

375
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,214
I think probably we should.

376
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,254
Don't you?

377
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,686
Aren't you gonna tell us
what to do?

378
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,690
No.

379
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,020
<i>You tell me.</i>

380
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,130
How do you put on a play?

381
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,826
You wear costumes
and say the words?

382
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,994
Well, then...

383
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,037
jump.

384
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,956
When do we start?

385
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,787
When do you think?

386
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,827
When the lights go on?

387
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,154
Good.

388
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,189
Should we start?

389
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,231
It's so hot,
and I'm tired.

390
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,859
What a dull book this is.

391
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,629
<i>What's the use of a book
wlthout plctures?</i>

392
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,600
Where do I enter from?

393
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:32,643
Where do you think?

394
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,645
Offstage?

395
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:44,255
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
I shall be too late.

396
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,457
Wait!

397
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,229
I think I hear the queen coming now.

398
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,495
And if something's not done
about it in less than no time,

399
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,867
I'll have everybody executed
all round.

[Voices overlapping]

404

Fill up the glass with treacle and ink

405
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,410
and anything else
that is pleasant to drink.

406
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,479
Mix sand with the cider
and wool with the wine,

407
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,525
and welcome Queen Alice
with ninety times nine.

408
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,117
Ninety times nine.

<i>(Phoebe)
Let's conslderwho It was

410
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,927
It must have been either me
or the Red King.

411
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,268
<i>He was part
of my dream.</i>

412
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:40,744
But then,
I was part of his dream too.

413
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,211
Which do you think it was?

414
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,618
[Clapping]

415
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,280
Bravo.

416
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,983
Welcome to Wonderland.

417
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,126
That was amazing.

418
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,060
She just let us do it.

419
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,860
And you were great.

420
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,060
You were awesome.

421
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,898
You definitely
won't get fired.

422
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,339
Fired?

423
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,000
<i>Oh, yeah,

424
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,043
Really?

425
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:17,946
Ever heard
of Kristen Vigard?

426
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,278
Exactly.

427
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,217
The real Annie,
fired a week before opening.

428
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:27,691
Andrea McArdle
went on to everlasting fame.

429
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,158
But don't worry.

430
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,626
You were great.

431
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,095
You were so different onstage.

432
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,358
How come you spit?

433
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,003
What?

434
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,810
I-I don't know.

435
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,870
I didn't used to.

436
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,582
Why do you want to play
a girl's part?

437
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:56,813
It's a play.

438
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,856
I can do whatever I want.

439
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,448
But why do you do it when
everyone makes fun of you?

440
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,795
Because.

441
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,064
So because for me too.

442
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,108
Sometimes,
I get this feeling...

443
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:24,274
this feeling
to jump off a roof.

444
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,180
You want to die?

445
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,775
No.

446
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:34,156
It's what I feel like all the time,

447
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,887
with the things I do.

448
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:41,398
I know I shouldn't,
but I can't help it.

449
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:46,528
It's like being on the edge of a roof
all the time.

Of course, it takes
all the running you can do

to stay in one place.

If you want to go

twice as fast as that.

<i>My mother.</i>

547
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,998
Made her nervous.

548
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,534
Do you hide things
from your parents

549
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,298
<i>If you thlnk
lt'll make them nervous?</i>

550
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,203
Of course.

551
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,606
What do you and the Red Queen
talk about?

552
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:26,179
Wonderland.

553
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,013
How nice it is to have a place

554
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,713
where things aren't
quite so fixed.

555
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:40,297
It's all the opposite there,
you know.

556
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,026
It'd be nice if...

557

558

<i>Same how?</i>

560
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,940
Different.

561

(Jenny)
Oh, please your majesty,

563
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,378
What shall we do?

564
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,853

This is not real
for us.

568
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,995
Your heads are
about to be chopped off.

569
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,758
This is high drama.

570
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:14,798
There is fear.

571
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,958
There is panic.

572
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,763
Listen.

573
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:19,860

574
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,427
<i>The executloners</i>

575

this very moment.

576

They are pounding at the door.

577
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,875
What do you do?

578
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,346
There would be
weeping and ranting,

579
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:42,723
sobs and cries,
plans for escape.

580
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,819
Will no one
take mercy on us?

581
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,024
Bring in the scene next week.

582
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,864
I want to feel the terror
of the last moments of your life.

583
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,371
Take risks, jump.

584
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,140
What does she want
from us?

585
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,872
It's just
a dumb play.

586
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,038
We're only ten.

587
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,877
Ten?

588
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,418
Ten?

589
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,544
When I was ten,

590
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,489
I played Cleopatra
as she fed the asp to her breast.

591
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:18,119
It was breathtaking.

592
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,129
The audience
was on the edge of their seats.

593
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,462
You could hear a pin drop,
they were so entranced.

594
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,866
My ten-year-old niece
is hard at work

595
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,234
unlocking the mysteries
of Stonehenge.

596
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,433
You'll be reading about her
within the year.

597
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,806
Ten, indeed.

598
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:33,844
Now, continue.

599
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,674
Alice, White Queen,
pick up where we left off.

600
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,447
I wish I could manage
to be glad,

601

you are.

Consider what
o'clock it is.

607

Consider anything,
only please don't cry.

608
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,896
Can you keep from crying
by considering things?

609

There, you see?

610
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,110
Two lines.

612
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,343
to complete joy.

613

729
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,720
Nothing.

730
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,762
Phoebe.

731
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,799
Phoebe.

732
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,858
It was...
it was the stairs.

733
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:01,803
But I had to...
every three...

734
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:05,638
three steps at a time.

735
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:06,676
What?
Say it again.

736
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,109
What, what?

737
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,509
I had to do it.

738
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,013
It was the stair stepping.

739
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,048
Yeah.

740
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:15,051
And I had to do every
three stairs at a time.

741
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,211
Why?

742
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,311
I can't help it.

743
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,482
Why?

744
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,616
I don't know why.

745
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,356
I just...

746
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:31,629
I want you to know.

747
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,637
You... you want me
to know?

748
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,434
Yeah.

749
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,239
(Hillary)
Okay.

750
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:41,411
Okay.

751
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,708
I want you to know why I...

752
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,614
I want you to know why
I do all these things.

753
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,744
I don't know why, Mommy.

754
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,381
Okay, okay.

755
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,084
Okay.

756
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,456
(Phoebe)
I don't know why.

757
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,087
(Hillary)
Okay, I got you.

758
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,358
I got you.

759
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,399
I'll find out.

760
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,566
No.

761
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,105
She doesn't have that.

762
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:21,511
You are all so ready to label,
medicate, and move on

763
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:25,646
as if a name
means something,

764
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:30,126
as if all the answers
are in a bottle.

765
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,756
I've seen that solution.

766
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:35,856
I have seen it
all around me,

767
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:39,869
and it is a life of side effects
and dulled minds.

768
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,764
Your profession just
doesn't like kids to be kids.

769
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,508
No.

770
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,521
I'll tell you what this is.

771
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,750
Because, see, she was never
this way, not this much,

772
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:03,657
so this is something new.

773
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:11,361
And what it is,
is, it's a little girl

774
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:17,396
who has somehow got it
into her mind that I...

775
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:20,307
that I... that I don't love her.

776
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,946
Because when you
put it all together

777
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,312
and you try to make sense of it,

778
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,783
she's obsessed with Wonderland,
and I'm writing a book on it,

779
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:34,222
and I realized she is doing it
to be close to me,

780
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:38,022
because she can tell...

781
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,594
She can tell
that I'm distracted.

782
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:51,769
And that's my fault,

783
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,140
that I let her see that.

784
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:00,747
That's my fault.

785
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,570
Who did this?

786
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,249
[Sighs]

787
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,878
I'd like to know who did this.

788
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:43,692
Miss Dodger, forget about it.

789
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,388
Who wrote the word "faggot"
on Jamie's costume?

790
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,095
Jamie, look up
the word "faggot,"

791
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:56,401
which, correctly spelled,
is F-A-G-G-O-T.

792
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,340
Look up the word, please,
and tell me what it says.

793
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,447
"Faggot...

794
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,511
<i>"a bundle of stlcks
or twlgs</i>

795
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,779
bound together."

796
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,447
Is that what Jamie is?

797
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:13,921
A bundle of sticks?

798
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,585
When you attach a word
to a person,

799
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,289
you had better know
what it means first.

800
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:23,959
Does anyone here want to own up
to idiocy as well as cruelty?

801
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:51,817
There used to be a day when
women weren't allowed to act...

802
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:58,232
and young boys would play women.

803
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:01,499
It was in Shakespeare's day,

804
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:06,474
and these great women,
Ophelia, Rosalind,

805
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,876
were played by young boys

806
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:15,214
who could act
with such a depth of passion

807
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,082
that they would bring tears
to the eyes

808
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,520
of everyone who watched.

809
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:30,424
These boys performed
the greatest theatrical roles ever written,

810
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,264
and they inspired all.

811
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:46,881
Jamie is only doing what boys
have done for centuries and...

812
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,683
Take your places for the top
of act one.

813
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,387
(Reiter)
Today we have experienced a tragedy.

814
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,226
Carlita's dead.

815
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:02,731
Yes, Tommy is right.

816
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,994
Carlita has passed away.

817
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:07,059
<i>Mr. Jacob found her
when he was cleanlng thls mornlng.</i>

818
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,832
- He took her away.
- How'd she die?

819
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,465
Gerbils are fragile creatures.

820
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,009
Carlita lived a long
and fulfilling life.

821
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,635
<i>- She lived six weeks.
- Rlght.</i>

822
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:16,679
Why'd she die?

823
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:17,714
We don't know.

824
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,011
Mr. Jacob said
she ate something bad.

825
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,050
<i>Yes.</i>

826
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:23,348
Who's turn was it
to take care of her yesterday?

827
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,752
<i>That has nothlng
to do wlth lt.</i>

828
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:29,588
Phoebe, you fed her,
didn't you?

829
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,126
I just gave her the normal food.

830
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,593
- You poisoned her.
- No, I didn't.

831
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,755
- You poisoned Carlita.
- No, I didn't!

832
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,059
<i>You dld.
You polsoned her.</i>

833
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,122
It was my turn.

834
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,100
- I fed her.
- It wasn't.

835
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,136
It was Phoebe's.

836
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,504
Stop!

837
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,835
- You killed Carlita.
- Killer.

838
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:45,899
Stop, Phoebe.

839
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,711
You have to come with me
to Principal Davis' office.

840
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,618
What?

841
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:58,949
Got in trouble today.

842
00:50:59,022 --> 00:50:59,989
You have to come.

843
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,547
What happened?

844
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,751
Carlita died.

845
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,691
The gerbil?

846
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,252
<i>Everyone thlnks
It's my fault.</i>

847
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,888
Of course it wasn't your fault.

848
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,024
So why do we have to go
to the principal's office?

849
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,662
I spat at Tommy and Sally.

850
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,228
<i>(Peter)
Oh, Phoebe.</i>

851
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,399
I couldn't help it.

852
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:19,874
What do you mean
you couldn't help it?

853
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,069
It means
she couldn't help it.

854
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,544
Please tell Mr. Davis
I couldn't help it.

855
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:24,807
(Olivia)
What'd she die of?

856
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,577
Did you tell Dr. Miles?

857
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:31,587
Phoebe's not seeing
Dr. Miles anymore.

858
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,020
As of when?

859
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,422
<i>(Hlllary)
As of today.</i>

860
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,459
Why?

861
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:38,585
Because he's a jackass.

862
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:39,629
What did he tell you?

863
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:40,685
Nothing, that's the point.

864
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,924
I'm looking for someone else.

865
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:44,159
Hmm.

866
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:45,667
<i>(Phoebe)
They all came at me,</i>

867
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:46,895
the other kids.

868
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,369
I got scared.

869
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,635
Well, you know,
you can choose not to spit.

870
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:52,675
No, I couldn't.

871
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,233
Remember, like I was telling you
about the myth of the girl.

872
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,109
Peter, leave her alone.

873
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,147
I'm not blaming her.

874
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,342
I'm just trying to get
to the bottom of it.

875
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,647
Don't worry, Phoebe,
we will handle your prick-cipal.

876
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,050
Oh.

877
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,145
What'd she die of?

878
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:06,416
Natural causes.

879
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,457
Olivia.

880
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:10,015
I can't stop thinking
about not doing it,

881
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:11,856
and then I have to.

882
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:14,192
We can all choose
not to do things

883
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:16,255
that hurt other people
and ourselves.

884
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,459
Like fight?

885
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,661
Ah, shit.

886
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,705
[Bell ringing]

887
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:32,348
Miss Dodger?

888
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,377
Hello.

889
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,910
Um, we're on our way
to a meeting with Mr. Davis,

890
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,049
and I-I realized we never...

891
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,059
I never introduced
myself properly.

892
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,152
I'm... l'm Hillary Lichten.

893
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:49,665
Yes.

894
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:53,567
Did Phoebe tell you
that I'm writing a book on Alice?

895
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:54,729
No.

896
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,396
It's my dissertation.

897
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:57,770
I'm turning it into a book.

898
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,435
So there's always been a lot
of Wonderland at our house.

899
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:02,937
<i>It seemed
such a colncldence,</i>

900
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,038
my interest and Phoebe's,

901
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,447
and here you are,
putting on the play.

902
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,781
Do you believe in coincidence?

903
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,050
I don't know.

904
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:15,091
I guess.

905
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:16,648
How's Phoebe doing?

906
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:17,852
I don't.

907
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,054
She's remarkable.

908
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,527
She's okay here?

909
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:26,933
<i>Marvelous.</i>

910
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:33,408
She doesn't ever, you know,
do things she shouldn't?

911
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,603
What shouldn't she do?

912
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:41,416
I don't know,
inappropriate things.

913
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:42,451
<i>Never.</i>

914
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,488
She's very happy here.

915
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:53,590
Thank you.

916
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:03,738
Normally I tend to stay away from,
you know...

917
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:04,774
in the classroom,

918
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:08,242
<i>because I thlnk that,
you know,</i>

919
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,245
the teachers can solve things
better than I can,

920
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:13,441
and... and well, frankly,
they're better at it than I am,

921
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,883
and I don't like...

922
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,813
[clears throat]

923
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:22,790
Sticky...
but well, the gerbil died,

924
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:26,351
and I guess the children
were a little upset,

925
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,829
<i>you know, pets are very dear
to chlldren, and...</i>

926
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:36,834
Well, she spat, Mrs. Lichten.
She spat.

927
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:39,841
Spat, spat, water rat.

928
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,274
What?

929
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,175
So, you know, I thought,
well, you could come in,

930
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:44,213
<i>and we could...</i>

931
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,545
chat about it.

932
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,174
Tommy spat first.

933
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:51,448
Phoebe, perhaps you'd let
Mommy and Daddy and I

934
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,284
talk alone for a little bit.

935
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:54,323
<i>All rlght?</i>

936
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,949
<i>And well, you know, here,</i>

937
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,186
you can have a candy too.

938
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:17,338
Phoebe is imaginative
and sensitive and passionate.

939
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,177
<i>And If she dld</i>

940
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,876
get excited
about the gerbil,

941
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,144
I'm sure she was
being provoked.

942
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:23,185
You heard her.

943
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,847
That other terror spat first.

944
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:26,889
Of course.

945
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:31,359
Naturally, I agree, but...

946
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,259
whether she's imaginative
is hardly the issue.

947
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,558
But it is.

948
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:35,928
It is.

949
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,864
She doesn't act that way
during play practice.

950
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:38,901
Ask her teacher.

951
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,869
Does she act this way at home?

952
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,364
No.

953
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:10,263
(Hillary)
Hi.

954
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,300
(Phoebe)
What happened?

955
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,064
Principal Davis thinks
there should be a consequence.

956
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,266
You understand why?

957
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:19,399
Yes.

958
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:22,771
He's taking you
out of the play.

959
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:24,279
No!

960
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,371
If your behavior improves...

961
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:26,415
I hate you all!

962
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:43,592
[Man clears throat]

963
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,328
There you are.

964
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,802
They want to take me
out of the play.

965
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,600
Talk to the king.

966
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,038
<i>But can he help?</i>

967
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,601
Of course he can.

968
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,009
That's a very...

969
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,014
<i>provoklng thlng to say.</i>

970
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,107
It's very provoking.

971
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,151
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

972
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,311
I thought there was nothing
I couldn't say.

973
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:05,945
Oh, no.

974
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,887
Words have tempers,
you know,

975
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,585
particularly verbs.

976
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,719
They're the...
they're the proudest.

977
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:14,229
Can he help me?

978
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:15,730
Can you?

979
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,790
<i>(Sally)
Phoebe Llchten,
who are you talklng to?</i>

980
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:18,799
Shh!

981
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:19,857
Are you crazy?

982
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,426
Go away.

983
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,006
No, not you.

984
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:26,303
I need help.

985
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:44,892
Hey, time for bed.

986
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:48,897
Okay, Phoebe.

987
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,125
There's nothing
wrong with me.

988
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,065
I know, I know.

989
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,298
I just... just a quick check.

990
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,744
I'm so sorry
about the play.

991
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:10,675
Okay, five more minutes.

992
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,717
I love you.

993
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,698
Please, please come back.

994
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:30,635
Come back.

995
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:35,069
[Chuckles]

996
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,941
I'm here to talk
about Phoebe Lichten.

997
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,810
Yes.

998
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:39,906
<i>Very good.</i>

999
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,281
She has to be put back
in the play.

1000
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,183
Well, yes, I agree.

1001
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,221
I agree.

1002
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:46,380
You didn't even consult me.

1003
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:47,423
<i>I would put her back.</i>

1004
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,321
Certainly, I would.

1005
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,452
But it's really out of my...

1006
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,429
<i>and other people who thlnk
It's best for her too.</i>

1007
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,464
And, you know, she spat.

1008
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,727
She... she did spit, you know?

1009
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,600
Phoebe's an
astonishing little girl.

1010
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,196
You should talk to her parents
and her teachers.

1011
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:06,299
It's really... I have very little
control over this.

1012
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,968
Why is that?

1013
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,033
You're the principal.

1014
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,415
Miss Dodger,
if a child makes trouble,

1015
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,316
the child is punished.

1016
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,614
This is the way it works,
you know?

1017
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:18,654
This is the way it is.

1018
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,416
And it was decided...

1019
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,514
Oh, please.

1020
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,826
I'm sorry.

1021
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:28,824
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1022
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,126
I... that just came out.

1023
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:34,829
I-I didn't...

1024
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,996
I'm sorry.

1025
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,376
[Dull banging sound]

1026
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:48,508
Who's there?

1027
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,110
Is someone there?

1028
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,692
Phoebe?

1029
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,338
<i>Phoebe,
why are you here?</i>

1030
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:45,374
Look.

1031
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,607
I think about
Alice falling.

1032
01:00:55,685 --> 01:01:00,816
And I look down,
and I get scared.

1033
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,585
Yes.

1034
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:10,027
I don't want to do those things
or say those things.

1035
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:15,059
I just have to...

1036
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:19,040
except here.

1037
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:22,737
Everywhere else,
I feel ugly.

1038
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:31,613
I want to tell you something

1039
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,986
which may not
make any sense.

1040
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:38,289
But I should say it just so that one day,
you might remember it,

1041
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:42,422
and maybe it will
make you feel better.

1042
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:48,702
At a certain point in your life,

1043
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,467
probably when too much of it
has gone by...

1044
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,437
you will open your eyes

1045
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:59,242
and see yourself
for who you are...

1046
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:05,745
especially for everything
that made you so different

1047
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,813
from all the awful normals.

1048
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:13,450
And you will say
to yourself...

1049
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,990
"But I am this person."

1050
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:22,638
And in that statement,

1051
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:26,368
that correction,

1052
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,501
there will be a kind of love.

1053
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,883
I'm so scared.

1054
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,524
We all are.

1055
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,498
Can we give thanks?

1056
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,003
No.

1057
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,870
Anyway, I'm on a hunger strike.

1058
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,068
The chicken's not cage-free.

1059
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,144
So?

1060
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,771
So you know what they do
to factory chickens?

1061
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,439
They hang them upside-down
and electrocute them,

1062
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:07,710
<i>but only a llttle.</i>

1063
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,012
<i>So they can usually
stlll feel It</i>

1064
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,246
when they get their throats cut.

1065
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,481
But, see, also,
the knife misses a lot.

1066
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,524
So they're still alive
for the last part,

1067
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:17,650
when they get dropped
into boiling water.

1068
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:18,694
Where'd you learn this?

1069
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:19,728
<i>In soclal studles.</i>

1070
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:20,763
Miss Linney was sick.

1071
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,560
So I had a substitute teacher
who told us everything.

1072
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,464
Oh, well, I'm not sure
it's all true.

1073
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:26,661
But I give thanks

1074
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,397
for my bright,
outspoken daughters.

1075
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,668
And I give thanks for substitute teachers
who tell the truth.

1076
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:32,708
<i>Good.</i>

1077
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:33,742
Phoebe?

1078
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:35,635
Nothing.

1079
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,770
When I was a girl,
we weren't allowed to eat

1080
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,712
until we could find something
to be thankful for.

1081
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,750
Then I'm going
on a hunger strike too.

1082
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,578
I think I know something
you could be grateful for.

1083
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,622
What?

1084
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,424
You're being put back
in the play.

1085
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,128
Really?

1086
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,029
I can play Alice?

1087
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:57,929
On a trial basis.

1088
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,127
Your drama teacher and I
fought very hard

1089
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,170
and your father too,

1090
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:03,228
<i>and we sald</i>

1091
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:04,568
that if you acted
in the classroom

1092
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,607
the way you do in the play,

1093
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,542
<i>everyone would be
very happy.</i>

1094
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,670
I'm thankful for being Alice.

1095
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:12,737
Good.

1096
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:14,783
Peter.

1097
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,686
I'm thankful for the Vicodin

1098
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:22,087
that's dulling the searing pain
in my hand.

1099
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:23,557
Good enough.

[Chuckles]

1101
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:30,962
Hey, who wants to go shopping
and blow next month's mortgage?

1102
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,024
No, Phoebe and I know
what we want.

1103
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,102
Yeah, what?

1104
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,137
Phoebe, sit down.

1105
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,466
Phoebe and I want a brother.

1106
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,769
<i>(Phoebe)
A brother, a brother, a brother!</i>

1107
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,574
- A brother!
- Okay, girls.

1108
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,236
<i>We found this book,
Where Bables Come From.</i>

1109
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:44,711
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1110
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,441
Well, let's not
talk about it now.

1111
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,483
It says you guys
have to get into bed

1112
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,518
and skoogy around.

1113
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:50,813
What does skoogy mean?

1114
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,548
Can we get these
off the table, please?

1115
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:54,146
Well, we can
talk about this later.

1116
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,588
And after
you've been skoogying...

1117
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:57,455
Okay, girls,
not quite so loud.

1118
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:59,255
<i>(Ollvla)

1119
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:00,295
Like sneezing.

1120
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:01,660
And the seeds come out.

1121
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,789
Is that how you made us?

1122
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:03,832
You sneeze.

1123
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,867
- Achoo!
- Bless you.

1124
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:05,968
[Both giggling]

1125

<i>(Ollvla)
Achoo, I made a baby.</i>

1126

Achoo, achoo!

01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:11,670
Twins!

1128
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,140

<i>[Together]

1130
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,302
Come on, come on.

1131
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:18,347
We want baby!

1132
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,005
We want baby!

We want baby!

<i>We want baby!</i>

We want baby!

1139
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:29,491
Do you really?

1140
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,492
You... you think your mother
could handle another one like you?

1141
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,132
Phoebe.

1142
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:41,692
Stay away.

1143
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,575
[Doors creak]

1144
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:47,609
You.

1145
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:48,974
You knew.

1146
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:51,536
Screw you.

1147
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:54,583
[Echoing laughter]

1148
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:01,990
It's not true, right?

1149
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:05,550
That's easy.

1150
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:09,120
It's only true
if it's not a lie.

1151
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,165
Ask me another.

1152
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:11,290
I-I didn't mean...

1153
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,358
That's just it.
You should have meant.

1154
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,837
What do you suppose is the use
of a child without meaning?

1155
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:19,739
I meant, am I why
she won't have another baby?

1156
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,106
Well, then say
what you mean.

1157
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,407
You might just as well have said
"I am what I eat"

1158
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,845
is the same as
"I eat what I am."

1159
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,810
Or "I like what I get"
is the same as...

1160
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:29,851
[chuckles]

1161
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:30,886
"I get what I like."

1162
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:33,854
You're just saying lines
from the book.

1163
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:34,890
But I need help.

1164
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:37,425
<i>I need you to help me!</i>

1165
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,324
After all we've done together.

(Peter)
You asleep?

1170
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:10,525
I wanted to find a story
to tell you,

1171
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:13,187
a Greek myth or a fable

1172
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:17,824
to explain what happened
to me tonight.

1173
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:22,064
And then I realized,
that's what my father used to do.

1174
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:26,901
Something would happen,
and he'd tell the story

1175
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:30,002
and then analyze it...

1176
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:35,449
anything to avoid saying it.

1177
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:39,750
What I need to say is...

1178
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:50,157
I have never been
so ashamed of myself.

1179
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:56,536
The words just came out.

1180
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:03,777
Yes, that's what it's like.

1181
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,960
If you want to go back to work,
I can finish up here.

1182
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:00,064
About what I said...

1183
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,930
At dinner.

1184
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:08,533
We haven't talked,
not really.

1185
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,048
I'm sorry.

1186
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:14,983
Talk to her.

1187
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,682
(Peter)
I did.

1188
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:21,780
And I have been,
and she says she's okay,

1189
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:24,553
but I don't think so.

1190
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,185
(Hillary)
What you said, those words.

1191
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:30,762
(Peter)
I know.

1192
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,596
(Hillary)
You don't want to talk to me now.

1193
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,694
Peter, I'm mad, really mad.

1194
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:36,738
(Peter)
I understand.

1195
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:38,739
(Hillary)
Yeah, I'm mad that you said that.

1196
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:41,367
I'm mad that you hurt her.

1197
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:42,410
(Peter)
God, I just...

1198
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,207
(Hillary)
I'm mad that I want her to be different,

1199
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,748
and I'm mad
that she is different.

1200
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:49,511
I'm mad that she's acting out
because she's unhappy,

1201
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,314
and I don't know
why she's unhappy

1202
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,582
and I can't make her happy,

1203
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,682
but her bizarre teacher can.

1204
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:59,990
I'm mad that I blame myself
for the way she acts.

1205
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:07,161
I'm mad that I think of mothers
as just mothers,

1206
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:12,572
and I-I'm mad that I care
if I'm a good one.

1207
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,045
I'm mad that when you
said that to her,

1208
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,310
I know you were right.

1209
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:26,184
I couldn't take
another one of her.

1210
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,966
I'm mad that I'm not writing,

1211
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:43,163
and I'm mad that someday,
I will be 70

1212
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,002

1213
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,372

And I'm mad that sometimes...

01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:07,952
I'm not scared of that at all

1217

That's funny.

1263
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:46,647
No, thank you.

1264
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,824
I actually wanted to talk to you
a little about Miss Dodger.

1265
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:54,796
Do you like her?

1266
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:57,923
Yeah, I like her a lot.

1267
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,127
Would you consider her
a good teacher?

1268
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:01,863
Yes.

1269
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,371
What kinds of things
does Miss Dodger do

1270
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,305
<i>that make her
a good teacher?</i>

1271
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,309
I don't know.

1272
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:11,175
She lets us do the things
that we want.

1273
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:14,044
She lets you do what you want.
I see.

1274
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,083
Like...

1275
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,217
Miss Dodger is very important to us.

1276
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:22,383
We like her...
we like her very much.

1277

her being so attached

1289
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:46,181
Off with your head.

1290
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:47,215
Good job.

we're not here to hurt anyone.

1293
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:52,678
We like Miss Dodger.

No one wants to do anything bad.
Do you understand that?

1297
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:00,054
What's Miss Dodger let you do.

1298
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:01,095
What we want.

1299
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:02,130
Twinkling tea.

1300
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:06,227
Yes, yes, twinkle, twinkle, little star.

1301
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:08,936
Does she let you
go up on the catwalk?

1302
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,562
No.

1303
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:11,936
I see.

1304
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,497
Have you ever
been up there before?

1305
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:16,510
No.

1306
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:17,545
Yes.

1307
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:19,672
One... one time.

1308
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:20,942
By yourself?

1309
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:23,450
No, with Miss Dodger.

1310
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,646
I see.

1311
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,916
Yes, well, that was very sweet
of Miss Dodger.

1312
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:29,082
She's very friendly.

1313
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:30,385
<i>Huh?</i>

1314
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:35,055
I love it when friendly people
let you do what you want.

1315
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,564
Phoebe, did you fall
from the catwalk?

1316
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:38,930
<i>(woman)
Good job.</i>

1317
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,093
Consider your verdict.

Phoebe.

1319
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:45,029
Did you fall from the catwalk,
or did you...

1320
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:46,074
jump?

1321
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:47,267

There's no name signed on it
at the bottom.

1328
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,190
Phoebe.

1329
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,955
Did you fall off the catwalk,

1330
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:06,995

or else you would have signed
your name like an honest man.

1333
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,891
That proves his guilt.

1334
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:14,958
Good Job Jenny.

01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,004
I didn't fall.

1337
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:20,769
You jumped?

1338
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,742
- Why?
- No reason.

1339
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:23,778
Consider your verdict.

1340
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,369
Jump.

1341
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:32,583

01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:39,257
Satisfaction brought it back.

1346
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,694
Does this have anything
to do with those trust falls?

1347
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,856
The red... the Red Queen,
she told me to.

1348
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:44,899
The Red Queen?

1349
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:47,333
She was just saying
what Miss Dodger always said.

1350
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:48,369
What Miss Dodger said.

1351
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:49,699
- Jump.
- Guilty.

1352
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,796
<i>Now, let the jury proceed.</i>

1353
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:53,465
- Consider your verdict.
- No, no.

1354
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:54,975
Consider your verdict.

1355
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,341
No, no,
words just came out.

1356
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:59,175
Phoebe...

1357
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,345
did Miss Dodger tell you to jump?

1358
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:05,853
<i>Dld she?</i>

1359
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,551
Thank you, Phoebe.

1360
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:14,823
Guilty, guilty, guilty.

1361
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:18,193
I didn't... she didn't
tell me to jump.

1362
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:19,233
What?

1363
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,529
<i>I dldn't...</i>

1364
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:22,661
I didn't know what she meant.

1365
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,137
I thought she meant
something else.

1366
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:26,003
- I don't know what you mean.
- I'm sorry.

1367
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:29,373
I was wrong.

1368
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:30,877
I didn't know what it meant.

1369
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:32,641
Thank you, Phoebe.
You may leave now.

1370
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:33,681
But...

1371
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:34,875
Phoebe.

1372
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:52,959
Hi.

1373
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:55,435
How'd it go?

1374
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,208
Are you always supposed
to feel hope?

1375
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:09,910
Did you jump because
you didn't feel hope?

1376
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:14,354
Oh, no, I feel hope there.

1377
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:16,550
At least, I did.

1378
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:19,287
Where?

1379
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,726
In Wonderland.

1380
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,431
But not here.

1381
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:32,932
I can see myself
wrecking and ruining.

1382
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:37,702
But I can't stop myself.

1383
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:44,247
I'll be right back.

1384
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,955
Ah.

1385
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,957
Was this here before?

1386
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:25,583
No, but I've always found

1387
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,287
children go where they want.

1388
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:29,421
They won't be stopped,
not if they don't want to.

1389
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,466
Then children shouldn't be
in the theater alone.

1390
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:32,659
Well, that would be a shame.

1391
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,405
Miss Dodger, my child is hurt,
and I am upset,

1392
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:38,734
and you are provoking me.

1393
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:40,172
I-I didn't mean to.

1394
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:41,368
I'm sorry.

1395
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,774
How could you let her
go up there?

1396
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:44,903
But I didn't tell her to.

1397
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,210
But she had been
up there with you.

1398
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:48,249
Yes.

1399
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:51,479
But you don't think
you're to blame.

1400
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:54,113
Do you think
you are to blame?

1401
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,051
I'm sorry.

1402
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:00,356
She's wondering if she's
supposed to feel hope.

1403
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:02,692
She's nine.

1404
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,863
Sometimes,
you think you don't have hope,

1405
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:10,871
but you keep on anyway.

1406
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:12,634

Not yet, your majesty.

1418
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,515
You're leaving?

1419
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:03,652
(Phoebe)
Is it because of me?

1420
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,386
Is it because of
what I said?

1421
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:09,891
Don't stop.

01:34:39,473 --> 01:34:42,067
And being so many different
sizes in a day,

1617
01:34:42,143 --> 01:34:43,872
it is very confusing.

1618
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:45,878
<i>It Isn't.</i>

1619
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:49,040
Well, perhaps
you haven't found it so yet.

1620
01:34:49,116 --> 01:34:52,813
But when you have to turn
into a chrysalis...

1621
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:57,756
you will someday, you know...
and then into a beautiful butterfly,

1622
01:34:57,825 --> 01:34:59,725
I think you'll feel
a little odd.

1623
01:34:59,794 --> 01:35:01,421
<i>Not a blt.</i>

1624
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:09,100
Your feelings
may be different.

1625
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:14,039
All I know is,
it would feel very strange to me.

1626
01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:16,975
<i>You, who are you?</i>

1627
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:21,938
