1
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:39,826
You may hear the bombs now.

2
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:41,915
If you’re still with us,
you can hear the bombs now.

3
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:45,342
They are hitting the centre of the city.

4
00:00:45,428 --> 00:00:46,804
Now we can hear explosions...

5
00:00:46,888 --> 00:00:51,350
..off in the distance
to the west of central Baghdad.

6
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:53,642
Clearly l 've never been there,...

7
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,680
..but this feels like
we 're in the centre of hell.

8
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:26,469
The 28 countries...

9
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,054
..with forces in the Gulf area...

10
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:31,016
..have exhausted all reasonable efforts...

11
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:33,515
..to reach a peaceful resolution,...

12
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,985
..have no choice...

13
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,356
..but to drive Saddam
from Kuwait by force.

14
00:01:47,876 --> 00:01:50,368
A great battle has been initiated.

15
00:01:50,463 --> 00:01:52,752
The mother of all battles.

16
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:54,169
Our objectives...

17
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:56,631
..in the Persian Gulf area clear,...

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,962
..our goals defined.

19
00:01:59,056 --> 00:02:02,141
Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait...

20
00:02:02,227 --> 00:02:04,599
..completely, immediately,...

21
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:06,597
..and without condition.

22
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:13,485
The liberation of Kuwait...

23
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:15,447
..has now entered a final phase.

24
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:19,484
l have therefore directed
to use all forces available,...

25
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,490
..including ground forces,...

26
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,584
..to eject the Iraqi army from Kuwait.

27
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:27,879
At this point it seems inevitable...

28
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:30,539
..that the ground war is only hours away.

29
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:33,043
Peter Arnett, Baghdad.

30
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,517
Don't ever for one minute
underestimate the enemy,...

31
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:48,569
..but remember, we're better soldiers.

32
00:02:48,656 --> 00:02:53,283
We're fighting with better equipment,
we're better trained and a lot smarter.

33
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,071
Sleep deprivation.
Our soldiers been up 46, 48 hours,...

34
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,657
..so stay on top of 'em.
Maintain your intervals.

35
00:02:59,752 --> 00:03:00,666
Any questions?

36
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:04,046
Let's have a Little prayer.

37
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:06,291
Dear God, protect us...

38
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:09,552
..as we protect our country
we so dearly Love.

39
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,768
Keep us safe that we’ll all get home
to see our families and our chlldren.

40
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:14,766
Amen.

41
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:16,217
Amen.

42
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:24,609
- Let's kill 'em all.
- Hu-ah!

43
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:33,865
You all right, Boylar?

44
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:37,669
Hell, yeah.

45
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,586
- Let's heat 'em up, Nat.
- See you in Baghdad.

46
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:42,544
Yes, sir.

47
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,116
Battle-carry Sabot.

48
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,791
Sabot bullet coming up, sir.

49
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:17,342
- Sabot loaded.
- Indexed.

50
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:18,173
Crew report.

51
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:19,839
- Driver ready.
- Loader ready.

52
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,421
Gunner ready to give Saddam
a new way to hurt.

53
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:23,430
- Hu-ah!
- Hu-ah!

54
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:24,466
Hu-ah.

55
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:27,182
All right, Boylar?

56
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:28,386
Roger that.

57
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,518
All Cougar elements, this is Cougar-6.
Report Red Con 1. Over.

58
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:40,616
All Sabre elements, this is Sabre-6.

59
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:41,618
Move out.

60
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:12,278
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.

61
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:13,777
No joy over here.

62
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:16,075
Permission to try an alternate route. Over.

63
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:19,413
Roger that, Cougar-6.
Work your way to phase line hammer.

64
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:22,073
- No surprises. Copy?
- Roger that.

65
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:25,373
I'm taking up the right flank.
I’ll get back to you. Out.

66
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:33,179
Contact. I see flashes, 3,500 metres, sir.

67
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,804
- All right.
- Hold on. They got no range.

68
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:41,394
2,500 metres and closing, sir.

69
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:43,061
Ready to lase and blaze.

70
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:45,863
Contact, sir. He's in range.

71
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:48,355
- Come on, let me kill his ass.
- Fire!

72
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:49,696
On the way!

73
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,073
Yeah! Yeah!

74
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,828
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

75
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,625
- Find me another target, Patella.
- Loaded!

76
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:02,458
- Identified.
- Fire.

77
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:10,675
Fire!

78
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:22,104
Got him! We got him!

79
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:23,740
Sabre-6, Liberty-6.

80
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:25,865
We got enemy tangos retreating...

81
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,360
..vicinity grid 2-4-9er-8.

82
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,825
Your pursuit should intercept
their retreat, grid 7-6-5.

83
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,585
Roger that, Liberty-6.

84
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,747
- Troops!
- Troops!

85
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:58,071
Cease fire! Cease fire!

86
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:09,043
Come on! Come on!

87
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,674
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.

88
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:14,957
Go ahead, Cougar-6.

89
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:17,424
I have got mines. Repeat, mines.

90
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:19,221
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

91
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:21,763
Work your way to gridline Charlie.

92
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:25,766
Cougar-6 to all Cougar elements.
Let's get the hell out of here.

93
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:48,834
Whoa! What the...

94
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,710
Oh, shit!

95
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:52,961
All Sabre units, this is Sabre-6.

96
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:55,890
We just lost a tank.
Anybody see the shooter?

97
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,596
- I didn't see anything.
- Where they coming from?

98
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,598
Who the hell is shooting at us?

99
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,184
Liberty-6, we got enemy tanks...

100
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,102
..retreating grid 7-6...

101
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,352
- Patella, that one of our tanks?
- Hard to tell.

102
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,727
Make it out, and fast!

103
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,869
Oh, shit! We're almost browning out.

104
00:08:12,953 --> 00:08:14,495
Nat, what's happening?

105
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,581
Liberty-6, we got enemy tanks on our flank.
We have contact.

106
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,663
This is Cougar-6.

107
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:21,539
Enemy tangos at phase line delta. Over.

108
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,753
- Patella, find me a target.
- I think I got one, sir.

109
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,632
Do you or do you not have a target?

110
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:26,548
I think so!

111
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:27,750
Gunner, Sabot, tank.

112
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:28,841
Identify! Up!

113
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,961
Fire!

114
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:33,678
He just fired, sir.

115
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:34,848
They're firing at us!

116
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:37,345
- Loader!
- Up, sir!

117
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:38,389
Fire!

118
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:43,065
Yeah! That's the one!

119
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,151
All right.

120
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:46,731
Sabre-6, we just lost Cougar-6.

121
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,902
- We got him.
- Sabre, you just lit up a friendly!

122
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,371
I heard you! We... what?

123
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:51,914
Oh, my God.

124
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,288
You just lit up Boylar, goddamn it!

125
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:57,082
Sabre-6, Nat, what's happening?

126
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:58,630
Patella, was that one of our tanks?

127
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:00,873
He fired, sir.

128
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:02,877
At us or at the T-72s?

129
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,919
I don't know.

130
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:06,338
At us or at the T-72s?

131
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:07,595
I don't know!

132
00:09:07,684 --> 00:09:09,723
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

133
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:12,184
Colonel Serling, report status now.

134
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:16,483
They have range on us, sir.

135
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:18,645
Sir!

136
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:44,009
Oh, Christ, Colonel...

137
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:50,978
I gave the order to fire.

138
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:17,180
So with your thermal equipment,...

139
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:21,180
..confused by burning tanks
and smoke obscuring your visual ID,...

140
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,814
..you couldn't tell the difference
between the T-54 and the Abrams.

141
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,810
I believe that, uh, we...

142
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:30,394
l should have known the difference,...

143
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:33,823
..even with the night scope.

144
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,033
If we weren't under attack,...

145
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:41,198
But, under the circumstances,
there was no way to tell the difference.

146
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,624
Under the circumstances,...

147
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:48,123
..I suppose there was
no way to tell the difference, but...

148
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:50,010
There was no way to tell the difference.

149
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:51,340
Thank you, Colonel.

150
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:53,598
That's all we need.

151
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:32,511
We’re almost browning out!

152
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:36,933
We got enemy tanks on our flank.
We have contact.

153
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:38,306
Aah!

154
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:40,062
We just lost Cougar-6!

155
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:42,396
You just lit up a friendly!

156
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:44,648
Colonel Serling?

157
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:45,692
Yes.

158
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:48,242
You OK? Can I get you something?

159
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,659
Yes, I'm fine. Fine.

160
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:52,833
Uh, yes, you can get me a cup of coffee.

161
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,200
You got it.

162
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:57,463
We missed you and Meredith
at Banacek's party last night.

163
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:00,088
I'm too old to dance with you youngsters.

164
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,965
Meredith's not,
so tell her to come without you next time.

165
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,132
Oh, OK. I will do just that...

166
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,174
..next time.

167
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:10,386
Colonel Serling.

168
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:13,601
- Hershberg in five. Coffee's coming.
- Thanks.

169
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:14,725
Yes.

170
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:20,736
Washington Post?

171
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:23,867
About?

172
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,410
Yes, I was there.

173
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:29,874
That's a matter of public record.

174
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:34,419
Well, thank you very much, Mr...

175
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:38,839
Gartner. Thank you, Mr. Gartner,
but I have nothing to say.

176
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:39,963
No, sir.

177
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:42,382
No, sir!

178
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:46,226
Well, I’ll do just that.

179
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:47,478
Right.

180
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:55,272
Colonel Serling's here, sir.

181
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,363
Ban.

182
00:12:56,452 --> 00:13:00,284
I'm not talking to you.
Won't even come to my anniversary party?

183
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:02,911
You and Sylvia have been together,
what, a month?

184
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:06,584
The way she danced with that marine,
it won't last another week.

185
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:08,665
It may be my last anniversary party.

186
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:10,461
Were you there for me?

187
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:12,260
What's up?

188
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:15,093
Hey, Nat.

189
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:17,009
I've got to talk to you.

190
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:18,264
How we holding, Ban?

191
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:19,633
Running late, sir.

192
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:22,018
- May I run a few things by you, sir?
- Quickly.

193
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:23,186
Lieutenant Boylar's parents...

194
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:24,224
Boylar?

195
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:27,355
Tom Boylar. He died in Al Bathra.

196
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:28,989
He'd been with me a long time.

197
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:31,991
- From Virginia, right?
- Roger that, sir.

198
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,319
His parents have written to me.
They're hearing rumours.

199
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,450
You know we can't discuss it.
You have to put them off.

200
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,867
- Yes, sir, but...
- Tell them he died in action.

201
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:43,710
- He's a hero. That's all they want to know.
- Roger, but it's not just his parents.

202
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,962
We got a call...

203
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,043
..from the Washington Post.

204
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,417
A reporter named Gartner.

205
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:50,007
A reporter called you about Al Bathra?

206
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:51,261
You didn't talk?

207
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:52,298
Of course not.

208
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:55,228
Nobody ’ll hang you out to dry.
I won't let 'em.

209
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:56,593
Did you listen to the tape, sir?

210
00:13:56,814 --> 00:13:58,190
Colonel, the war's over.

211
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:02,355
You and I have been given
the great responsiblility and privilege...

212
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:05,400
..of investigating combat medals
for our army.

213
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:07,733
In other words, we've been passed over.

214
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:10,870
I prefer to think of it
as a second chance, Nat.

215
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:12,996
We understand each other?

216
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,079
Yes, sir.

217
00:14:14,168 --> 00:14:15,627
OK.

218
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:20,255
The White House heard we're considering
the Medal of Honour for a chopper pilot...

219
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:21,920
..who saved some guys
on a downed Blackhawk.

220
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,012
- Naturally they want it for Veterans Day.
- Naturally.

221
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,134
Which is why
you're taking over the inquiry.

222
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:31,975
We've got the rescued soldiers
in there for debriefing.

223
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,442
Attention.

224
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,604
Morning. Take your seats.

225
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:39,859
Everything in order?

226
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:44,575
- Just going over the sequence of events.
- Bring Colonel Serling up to speed.

227
00:14:44,662 --> 00:14:45,611
Morning, sir.

228
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:47,033
Good to see you again.

229
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:49,496
Could we get a picture
of you and the survivors?

230
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:51,127
No, thank you.

231
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:53,584
- Keep me in the loop.
- Thank you, sir.

232
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:58,001
- Morning.
- Morning.

233
00:14:58,094 --> 00:15:02,045
Doug Bruno, White House.
Do everything my way and we’ll be fine.

234
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:04,095
Nat Serling.

235
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:06,759
I’ll, uh, get out of your way.

236
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:10,103
- Major.
- Sir.

237
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:13,526
25 February,
these men were part of a refueling convoy.

238
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:17,112
Their Blackhawk was shot down
by an SA-7 west of Al Kufan.

239
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,404
Five seconds after it locked on,
we were down.

240
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:24,328
- We didn't know what hit us.
- Our lines were surrounding them so fast,...

241
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,742
..we got caught in a pocket of resistance.

242
00:15:26,836 --> 00:15:32,128
Iraqi ground troops on the ridge above
kept them completely pinned down.

243
00:15:32,218 --> 00:15:34,045
Did you discuss surrendering?

244
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,724
Yes, sir, we did.

245
00:15:40,811 --> 00:15:43,100
We were all wounded one way or another.

246
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:46,356
We weren't trained
for that kind of situation, sir.

247
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:48,519
Don't have to make excuses to me.

248
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:50,071
Go on, Sam.

249
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:52,113
That's all we got so far, sir.

250
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,824
OK.

251
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,152
- Lieutenant Chelli.
- Yes, sir.

252
00:15:56,246 --> 00:16:00,493
Well,
as if things weren't bad enough already,...

253
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,624
..one oftheir T-54s...

254
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,461
..joins the rag heads up on the ridge.

255
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,344
Incoming! Get down!

256
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:21,474
That round
kills the medic, Relleno, Gerspach,...

257
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:24,355
..and, uh, Egan here lost his leg.

258
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:26,771
So we figure that's it. We're dead.

259
00:16:27,824 --> 00:16:29,616
But then we hear it.

260
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,908
Nothing like the sound of an inbound Huey.

261
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:38,706
Yeah!

262
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:39,709
Yeah!

263
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:44,626
This Huey, did it take any fire?

264
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:45,799
Right offthe bat.

265
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:49,886
But this time
when the Huey comes back, it returns fire.

266
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,684
Ground troops go for cover.

267
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:54,178
Then the Huey circles back over the tank...

268
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:57,523
That's when
they threw something overboard.

269
00:16:57,609 --> 00:17:02,568
- Threw something, or something fell off?
- I couldn't tell, but the tank blew.

270
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:05,154
Oh!

271
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:06,524
Yeah!

272
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,245
Man, did it ever blow!

273
00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:12,952
We, uh, we never did see
what knocked the Huey down.

274
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:20,043
We couldn't see the crash.

275
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:24,047
That night we caught sporadic ground fire.

276
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,640
The Huey was down below,
between us and the enemy,...

277
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:29,851
..so they caught most of it.

278
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:32,477
Any communications
between you and them?

279
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,975
No, sir. As I said, our radio was wasted.

280
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,478
Shouting just draws enemy fire.

281
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:42,615
So the Iraqis,
they start to close in on the Huey...

282
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:44,198
..under cover fire,...

283
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:46,780
..and the Huey returns fire.

284
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,826
We figure it's all over,
and that's when we hear the rescue team.

285
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:52,416
Cobras, Hueys...

286
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:54,666
And a big-ass A-10 Thunderbolt.

287
00:17:57,429 --> 00:17:59,636
I swear I never heard such a sweet sound.

288
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:01,764
But now the fuckers are...

289
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,520
I'm sorry, sir.

290
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:07,226
The Iraqis are letting loose with all they got.

291
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:10,187
- You were right the first time.

292
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:14,691
Plus the Huey crew is still banging away.

293
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:17,654
We load our wounded aboard,...

294
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:21,079
..and that's when
somebody decided to leave the dead.

295
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,242
I guess it was the commander ofthe rescue.

296
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,284
Mm-hmm.

297
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:26,038
And this... Huey crew,...

298
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,175
..they, uh, they returned fire
all through the final rescue?

299
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,134
Yes, sir. I... I think so.

300
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,712
I couldn't see much, though.

301
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:35,756
I heard it.

302
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:39,468
Nothing else sounds like an M-16.
Not no A-K or M-60.

303
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:41,935
I heard it, too.

304
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:47,267
The last thing we see is the Thunderbolt
dropping napalm on the downed choppers.

305
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:50,530
I don't know if it was Captain Walden...

306
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:53,108
..but that Huey...

307
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:54,579
..saved our lives.

308
00:18:58,459 --> 00:18:59,918
It sure sounds like it.

309
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,333
OK.

310
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:10,505
Thank you for your help.
I’ll look over your statements.

311
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:11,797
Thank you, sir.

312
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:13,552
Thank you, Colonel.

313
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:14,759
That’ll be all.

314
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,846
- Got something for me?
- I do, sir.

315
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:19,810
Walden's 201 file. Evaluation reports.

316
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:22,772
You know I'm going to need
background on these guys.

317
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:27,027
Make sure we don't have a wife-beater
or an illegal allen or gays.

318
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:28,493
That’ll blow it.

319
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:30,820
About this Congressional Medal of Honour.

320
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:35,209
It's not the Congressional Medal of Honour.
It's just the Medal of Honour.

321
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:36,457
Tell that to Congress.

322
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:38,669
If Captain Walden wins this medal...

323
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:41,165
You don't win it. You, uh, receive it.

324
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:42,837
It's not a contest.

325
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:45,598
But that is perfect. That is why I'm here.

326
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:48,849
I'm not here
to get down your throat, make you crazy,...

327
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:50,975
..take these facts and twist them.

328
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:55,013
I just want to get these nuances out
of your head and to get it straight from you.

329
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:57,565
- It's a woman.
- You didn't know?

330
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,691
What did you think the hoopla was about?

331
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,700
Banacek's got information
on three of Walden's men.

332
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:08,164
- The crew chief we're still tracking.
- This is Captain Karen Emma Walden.

333
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:13,921
She's the first woman ever to be nominated
for a Medal of Honour for combat.

334
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,382
I mean, this is gold.

335
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:16,877
It's gold.

336
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,419
Unfortunately it's posthumous,...

337
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:21,802
..but I've got her Little daughter.

338
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,429
I got the President of the United States.

339
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:26,808
It's all set in the Rose Garden.

340
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:31,358
The President's going to lean down and
hang that ribbon round that pretty face.

341
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:35,738
There is not going to be
a dry eye from Nashua to Sacramento.

342
00:20:35,823 --> 00:20:37,947
Excuse us.

343
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:46,958
OK, it was 5 to 1,...

344
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,872
..hook shot.

345
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:51,206
Me and her are cheerleaders.

346
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,716
- More mashed potatoes.
- Sorry, no more potatoes,...

347
00:20:54,804 --> 00:20:57,556
..but how about some bread?

348
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:00,476
Aah!

349
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:02,269
Aah!

350
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:05,024
Daddy, can I have your mashed potatoes?

351
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:08,856
Daddy?

352
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:10,985
Sir?

353
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:12,989
Can I have your mashed potatoes?

354
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:16,069
M... Yeah. Sure.

355
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:17,657
Yeah,...

356
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:19,290
..soldier.

357
00:21:19,374 --> 00:21:20,537
You want 'em all?

358
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:23,910
That enough?

359
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:28,583
More?

360
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,128
Hello?

361
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:33,179
Yes.

362
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:35,555
Uh, who is calling, please?

363
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:37,019
Just a minute.

364
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:39,893
It's for you.

365
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:40,931
Who is it?

366
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:42,519
Somebody Gartner.

367
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,063
Want some more peas?

368
00:22:24,784 --> 00:22:25,947
Excuse me.

369
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:41,634
Where are you going?

370
00:22:41,721 --> 00:22:42,884
Fort Hood.

371
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:47,185
General Hershberg's got me investigating
a Medal of Honour.

372
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:49,227
It's a woman.

373
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:50,891
Good for her.

374
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:53,140
Posthumous.

375
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:55,477
Too bad, but still good for her.

376
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,820
Mmm. Too bad.

377
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,000
You talk to the investigators today?

378
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:11,119
Right.

379
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,501
It's all right, isn't it, Nat?

380
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,388
Yeah. Fine.

381
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:23,893
How long are you gone for?

382
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:25,473
Couple of days.

383
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:31,483
Then why are you emptying
your sock drawer?

384
00:23:34,324 --> 00:23:37,908
I may be gone more than a couple of days.

385
00:23:47,006 --> 00:23:48,121
Nat.

386
00:23:48,216 --> 00:23:49,378
Yes.

387
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:53,134
I don't know what's happening.

388
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:54,882
Everything's fine.

389
00:23:56,183 --> 00:23:57,594
I'm handling it.

390
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:33,264
Mr. Rady,
you were Captain Walden's copilot.

391
00:24:33,352 --> 00:24:34,265
That's right.

392
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:38,268
Can you tell me
what you remember about Al Kufan?

393
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:49,912
I remember the earth.

394
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,041
I remember... Ilario's face.

395
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:58,753
I wish...

396
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,335
- She hadn't needed to be a hero so bad.
- That's not fair.

397
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,755
We were just doing our job.

398
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:09,970
It's not Ren's fault I got hit.

399
00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:13,976
She sure as hell saved the lives
of those guys on the Blackhawk.

400
00:25:14,942 --> 00:25:18,193
- You always defend her.
- Why didn't you like her?

401
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:19,940
She was so butch.

402
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:21,442
Honey, shut up.

403
00:25:23,536 --> 00:25:25,279
She was, you know.

404
00:25:26,664 --> 00:25:29,701
One of those women
who want to be officers...

405
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,702
Annie, shut up.

406
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,796
She gave her life for those men.

407
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:42,599
She was a soldier.

408
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:01,325
There she blows.

409
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:15,378
- We're taking fire!
- Holy shit!

410
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,436
- Kill that motherfucker, Bonfires!
- I may as well be pissing on him.

411
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:28,645
- We need a fucking air strike!
- We got no fucking bomb!

412
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,817
- Making another pass, Ran?
- Yep.

413
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:38,245
No! We should go for altitude,
and call for support.

414
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:39,874
After we slow down that tank!

415
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:43,586
- How we gonna do that?
- Shut up and listen, soldier!

416
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:46,957
Altameyer,
unhook the aux fuel bladder port side.

417
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,842
Get ready to push it overboard.

418
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,303
Push it overboard, ma'am?

419
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:52,427
Ilario, unhook the flare gun!

420
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:53,594
What the fuck...

421
00:26:53,683 --> 00:26:55,308
Do it!

422
00:26:55,393 --> 00:26:57,433
It's a bomb, asshole!

423
00:26:59,773 --> 00:27:01,316
Target coming up!

424
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:02,849
Gimme more!

425
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:04,189
Ready here!

426
00:27:05,322 --> 00:27:06,401
- Got it?
- I got it!

427
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:12,992
- Tell us when you're there! He’ll kick it!
- Allow for the speed of the craft!

428
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:16,035
- The pod will drop at the same velocity!
- He knows.

429
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,539
Pick your moment!

430
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:19,459
Now!

431
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:33,929
Oh, my God!

432
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,646
Oh!

433
00:27:39,111 --> 00:27:40,392
Whoa! Shit!

434
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:42,564
Whoa! Oh, God!

435
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:44,864
Hang on, Ilario! Grab a hold of me!

436
00:27:44,951 --> 00:27:46,410
Don't let go of me! Pull me in!

437
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:49,745
Hang on.
Come on, Ilario! Pull yourself up!

438
00:27:49,832 --> 00:27:51,540
Do something!

439
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:55,042
No! No! Rady, call in a Mayday!

440
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,752
Ilario,... call it in!

441
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:02,386
Mayday! Dustoff-3... we are going down!

442
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,800
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!

443
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,179
We're going down! Mayday! Mayday!

444
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,383
This is Dustoff-3!

445
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,471
We're going down! We're going down!

446
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,438
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!

447
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,473
We are going down!

448
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:16,102
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!
We're going down! We're going down!

449
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,070
We're going down! Oh, my God...

450
00:28:31,047 --> 00:28:32,078
That's it.

451
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:37,550
I woke up three days later
on a hospital ship.

452
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:39,298
Nearly bought it, that's sure.

453
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:47,106
When did you decide
the type of career in the Army you wanted?

454
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:51,688
That happened about
my third year at WestPoint when l was...

455
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,271
l could have gone in the Air Force.

456
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,323
l stood high enough in my class.

457
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:00,325
You can't get away from that guy.
He's everywhere.

458
00:29:00,415 --> 00:29:03,202
- Hell of a soldier, though.
- You think so?

459
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:04,752
I know so.

460
00:29:04,837 --> 00:29:06,331
Really. How?

461
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:08,878
I was with him in the Gulf.

462
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:09,915
No shit.

463
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:13,094
- Doing what?
- Armoured cavalry.

464
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,460
Hu-ah.

465
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:16,265
Hu-ah.

466
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,138
Once upon a time,
I was humping in the delta.

467
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:21,268
- With who?
- The 9 th.

468
00:29:21,356 --> 00:29:24,108
- You kicked some serious butt.
- That's right.

469
00:29:24,193 --> 00:29:26,862
- One for my friend...
- Colonel Nat Serling.

470
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:30,896
Make it a double for Colonel Serling.
Tony Gartner, Washington Post.

471
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:36,696
They won't find any criminal culpability
in the Al Bathra incident.

472
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:38,369
You got nothing to worry about.

473
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:39,918
Those were my men.

474
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:42,245
I put that badly. I'm sorry.

475
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:46,124
Look, I went to Virginia
and spoke with Mr. and Mrs. Boylar.

476
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:49,716
You what?

477
00:29:49,806 --> 00:29:53,935
I'm sorry, but they got a right
to know what happened to their son.

478
00:29:58,608 --> 00:29:59,806
I’ll take that.

479
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:25,674
And this Huey crew, they, uh,
returned fire all through the final rescue?

480
00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:27,259
Yes, sir. l think so.

481
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,631
l couldn',t see much.

482
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,479
- l heard it.
- Nothing else sounds like an M-16.

483
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,678
Not know A-K or M-60.

484
00:30:32,773 --> 00:30:34,267
l heard it, too.

485
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:38,024
Last thing we see
is the Thunderbolt dropping napalm...

486
00:30:38,113 --> 00:30:40,022
..on the two downed choppers.

487
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,032
Oh!

488
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:36,337
Sir!

489
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:42,723
All right, this is antifungal cream,...

490
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:46,859
..but to kill the athlete's foot when
you're in the shower, just piss on your feet.

491
00:31:46,943 --> 00:31:48,058
That's disgusting.

492
00:31:48,153 --> 00:31:50,276
What've you got for me today?

493
00:31:50,364 --> 00:31:55,704
You want to get rid of the allergies to
bee pollen, then no caffeine, no chocolate.

494
00:31:55,787 --> 00:31:58,457
Jesus. I give up coffee,
you can bury me now.

495
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:04,120
- Morning, Colonel.
- Morning. You got some aspirins?

496
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,412
How many do you want?

497
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,966
I take eight every day.

498
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,964
Four's good.

499
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,136
- I need to talk to you, Specialist.
- Sir?

500
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:16,015
I'm investigating the recommendation to
award a Medal of Honour to Captain Walden.

501
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:18,595
Rowtero?

502
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:19,638
Yeah?

503
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:21,143
Can you cover for me?

504
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:23,772
I'm going to go feed the cancer genes.

505
00:32:23,862 --> 00:32:26,318
Do you really need to, uh, I mean...

506
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:33,157
It's fine.

507
00:32:33,248 --> 00:32:34,991
Uh, what do you want to know?

508
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:38,540
How long were you with Captain Walden?

509
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:40,836
Um... over... over two years.

510
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:42,334
Quite a long time.

511
00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:43,540
Yeah.

512
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:44,714
You were her medic.

513
00:32:44,803 --> 00:32:46,345
Yes, sir.

514
00:32:47,973 --> 00:32:49,551
I don't fly any more though.

515
00:32:51,728 --> 00:32:53,519
Well, don't miss it, do you?

516
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:54,554
Never.

517
00:32:54,648 --> 00:32:56,190
Never again.

518
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,899
That's quite a habit you got.

519
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,819
Yeah, it's, uh...

520
00:33:00,905 --> 00:33:03,527
..one of the few things I can call my own.

521
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:10,154
So...

522
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:12,657
..tell me what happened at Al Kufan.

523
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:25,508
See, I'd, uh...

524
00:33:26,894 --> 00:33:29,681
..I'd never been in... in combat.

525
00:33:38,699 --> 00:33:40,739
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!

526
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:44,036
We're going down!
Mayday! This is Dustoff-3...

527
00:34:10,403 --> 00:34:11,352
Ilario?

528
00:34:11,446 --> 00:34:12,940
Yeah, I'm OK.

529
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:15,238
Rady's hurt.

530
00:34:15,325 --> 00:34:16,820
Monfriez?

531
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:18,109
100%%%.

532
00:34:19,247 --> 00:34:20,112
Altameyer?

533
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:21,707
Functioning.

534
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,286
Fire in the hold!

535
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:31,086
Come here, buddy.

536
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,087
This is Dustoff-3.

537
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:36,012
Acknowledge.

538
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,974
This is Dustoff-3.

539
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,009
Here. Come on.

540
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:40,562
This is Dustoff-3.

541
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:41,762
Come on.

542
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:44,692
Dustoff-3. Acknowledge.
Altameyer, how's that fire?

543
00:34:44,777 --> 00:34:47,149
Under control. Fuel tank's intact.

544
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:50,732
Enemy at the back door!

545
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:51,821
Come on! Come on!

546
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,535
Monfriez, get that saw working!

547
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,652
Come on! Get down!

548
00:35:00,337 --> 00:35:01,997
I've got the M-16!

549
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:04,580
Ilario?

550
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:05,920
He's bad. It's the lung.

551
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:17,305
We gotta get him out of here.

552
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:21,104
- Head wound?
- Superficial. How's the radio?

553
00:35:21,194 --> 00:35:23,068
Dead. So's the ADT.

554
00:35:24,365 --> 00:35:26,322
Monfriez, easy on the ammo!

555
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:27,903
We might be here a while!

556
00:35:28,036 --> 00:35:29,067
Captain!

557
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,418
You've seen me do this a million times.
You’ll be fine.

558
00:35:37,797 --> 00:35:38,793
Ammo?

559
00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:41,338
I got this belt and three more boxes.

560
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,339
OK, Altameyer,
rip out everything you can from the inside.

561
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:49,058
We're gonna make a perimeter.

562
00:35:49,144 --> 00:35:51,433
Monfriez, cover us!

563
00:35:51,522 --> 00:35:52,518
Go!

564
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:00,898
Where's our Kevlar?

565
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:02,022
I got one!

566
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,692
Well, put it on!

567
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,789
Unh. How's he doing?

568
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,209
He's the same.

569
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,709
I need a hook.

570
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:25,810
As soon as it gets dark, we dig in.

571
00:36:25,895 --> 00:36:27,010
Then we wait.

572
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:28,136
For what?

573
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:29,774
For the good guys.

574
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:37,107
You won't think it's so funny
when I nail your fucking ass!

575
00:36:40,454 --> 00:36:42,494
Yeah, they were laughing.

576
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,789
You about, uh... You done?

577
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:49,791
So tell me what happened...

578
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:52,040
..during the night.

579
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,502
You were there. You saw the nights.

580
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:56,256
You know, just... it was black.

581
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:57,546
Just... black.

582
00:36:57,641 --> 00:36:59,681
Tell me what happened that night.

583
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,518
Well, she put us on two-hour watches.

584
00:37:03,606 --> 00:37:09,610
Um... it's not like
any of us were going to sleep anyway.

585
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:15,071
Head down, Altameyer. You might lose it.

586
00:37:16,955 --> 00:37:17,951
You OK, Captain?

587
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,033
Shit in my eye.

588
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,953
Will our guys come tonight?

589
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:23,462
They’ll be here.

590
00:37:23,546 --> 00:37:25,124
Dust is blowing pretty bad.

591
00:37:25,215 --> 00:37:27,587
I don't know
how much longer Rady can hang on.

592
00:37:27,676 --> 00:37:30,084
I can hear the rag heads
when you're not gabbing.

593
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:32,136
Then I'd suggest everybody just...

594
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:54,659
They're going away.

595
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:56,327
It was just a probe.

596
00:37:56,418 --> 00:37:57,497
Ilario?

597
00:37:57,586 --> 00:37:58,535
I'm OK.

598
00:37:58,629 --> 00:37:59,578
Altameyer?

599
00:37:59,672 --> 00:38:00,454
My ear!

600
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:01,544
Monfriez?

601
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:03,257
I... I took one.

602
00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:08,338
- Rady?
- Hanging in. How about you, Cap?

603
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:09,762
Unh...

604
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,724
Oh, shit.

605
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:13,519
Stay with Rady.

606
00:38:19,737 --> 00:38:21,397
I like to come here.

607
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:25,570
It's not just the bikinis,
although they ain't bad.

608
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:28,282
It's these kids.

609
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,199
I like to watch them, you know?

610
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:33,292
My folks had this place
out on Calaveras Lake.

611
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:36,463
I still go there sometimes, watch 'em dive.

612
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,091
They do the damnedest things.

613
00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:40,631
They never think about the consequences.

614
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:44,056
Imagine that.

615
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:47,308
Imagine not thinking
about the consequences?

616
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:49,138
Imagine that.

617
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:55,186
Are... are we done?

618
00:38:58,157 --> 00:39:00,446
After the attack...

619
00:39:00,535 --> 00:39:02,409
..during the night...

620
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:04,453
What?

621
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:06,034
I mean, we waited.

622
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,536
I... I still don't...

623
00:39:07,626 --> 00:39:12,373
- I... I don't know what you...
- Just go on with what happened.

624
00:39:15,969 --> 00:39:21,973
Well, Karen,...
the captain,... uh, was hurt pretty bad.

625
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:24,509
Ohh...

626
00:39:24,605 --> 00:39:27,772
Unh...

627
00:39:27,858 --> 00:39:29,816
Unh!

628
00:39:30,862 --> 00:39:32,238
How many rounds left?

629
00:39:32,322 --> 00:39:33,603
Just a sec.

630
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:35,110
How many rounds?

631
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,110
I just opened my last can of ammo.

632
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,279
Five mags for the M-16,...

633
00:39:39,372 --> 00:39:40,451
..9-mil's full.

634
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:41,579
Mine's empty.

635
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:45,001
Fire a couple of rounds off.

636
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:48,124
- Let 'em know we're still allve.
- Roger that, Captain.

637
00:39:50,009 --> 00:39:53,628
Now save your ammo
for something you can see.

638
00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:00,228
During the course of the incident,
did she display any doubt, any fear...

639
00:40:00,313 --> 00:40:03,765
..when she had to make
these life-and-death decisions?

640
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,686
No.

641
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,107
No. Never.

642
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,394
She just made 'em.

643
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,447
Just like that?

644
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,028
Just like that.

645
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,990
Karen,... the captain... she had this quality.

646
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,702
The heavier the pressure,
the calmer she got.

647
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,619
We knew they were out there,...

648
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:21,371
..sneaking up on us.

649
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:25,129
But we also knew
at first light they were going to attack.

650
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:29,216
I don't know why people think only
good things happen when the sun rises.

651
00:40:29,472 --> 00:40:30,587
Incoming!

652
00:40:41,028 --> 00:40:42,023
How many?

653
00:40:42,112 --> 00:40:43,393
100. Maybe more.

654
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:45,031
Any good at hand-to-hand?

655
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:47,405
Wait till they get closer.

656
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:50,115
Make every round count!

657
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,793
- Shit!
- Quiet!

658
00:40:54,877 --> 00:40:56,420
What in Christ for?

659
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:57,998
They know we're here!

660
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,047
Quiet! I hear something!

661
00:41:03,512 --> 00:41:05,422
Choppers!

662
00:41:07,934 --> 00:41:10,260
Hey!

663
00:41:10,354 --> 00:41:13,189
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

664
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:14,934
Go! Go!

665
00:41:15,026 --> 00:41:16,306
Yeah!

666
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:26,914
Let's get out of here!

667
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:28,029
Ilario, get the captain!

668
00:41:28,124 --> 00:41:29,535
There's the rescue!

669
00:41:37,218 --> 00:41:39,461
Help Rady!

670
00:41:39,554 --> 00:41:41,179
Pick him up!

671
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,008
Go! Let's go! Let go! Let's go!

672
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:47,100
Come on! Let's move! Move it!

673
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:49,690
Gotta go! We gotta go!

674
00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:51,898
Come back for me with a stretcher!

675
00:41:51,986 --> 00:41:53,065
Go!

676
00:42:13,678 --> 00:42:15,920
Ilario, let's get the fuck outta here!

677
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:19,550
Get the fuck outta here!

678
00:42:32,992 --> 00:42:34,403
Aah!

679
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:36,036
Aah!

680
00:42:38,499 --> 00:42:39,530
Medic!

681
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:43,496
Come on! Get him up!

682
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:49,591
Move! Come on! Let's go!

683
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:54,512
Where's Walden?

684
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:57,430
Captain Walden is dead.

685
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:03,730
Strike leader, this is Dustoff-6.

686
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,905
We have all the friends.
You're clear and hot.

687
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,660
Roger, Dustoff-6. Going on down.

688
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,789
So...

689
00:43:20,882 --> 00:43:23,338
Is she gonna get it?
Is she gonna get the medal?

690
00:43:23,426 --> 00:43:26,926
Well, I sincerely hope so.

691
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:30,514
I just... I don't want to tell that story again.

692
00:43:30,601 --> 00:43:32,808
Not one more time.

693
00:43:32,896 --> 00:43:34,556
Yeah, I understand.

694
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:37,817
May I be excused?

695
00:43:37,901 --> 00:43:40,025
Yes, you can.

696
00:43:40,112 --> 00:43:43,067
Oh, one more thing I'm confused about.

697
00:43:44,576 --> 00:43:46,154
This M-16...

698
00:43:47,496 --> 00:43:48,445
What?

699
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:50,413
Did it run out of ammo?

700
00:43:52,168 --> 00:43:54,126
Uh, what did I say?

701
00:43:55,464 --> 00:43:58,251
I don't remember. That's why I'm asking.

702
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:01,510
I guess, uh...

703
00:44:01,596 --> 00:44:05,594
I guess it ran out of ammo
sometime during the morning.

704
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,511
Um...

705
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,263
Or, no, sometime during the night...

706
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,731
I don't know.

707
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:14,149
See, the Blackhawk crew
said they heard M-16 fire...

708
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:17,522
..during the rescue that morning.

709
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:19,567
Did they?

710
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:22,150
That's right.

711
00:44:22,245 --> 00:44:23,905
Must've been wrong, then.

712
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:24,946
Them or you?

713
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,499
Who, them or you?

714
00:44:26,584 --> 00:44:27,864
Oh, them. Them, yeah.

715
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,585
No, they must have been wrong.

716
00:44:29,837 --> 00:44:31,629
OK.

717
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:33,789
OK.

718
00:44:35,552 --> 00:44:37,047
What about the letter?

719
00:44:38,514 --> 00:44:39,463
A what?

720
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,639
You and Walden traded letters to send home
in case anything happened to you.

721
00:44:43,729 --> 00:44:44,843
Oh, yeah. Yes, sir.

722
00:44:44,938 --> 00:44:46,267
So, who was hers to?

723
00:44:46,357 --> 00:44:47,306
Her folks.

724
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,891
- So you sent it?
- Yeah.

725
00:44:49,986 --> 00:44:51,694
Her folks, they're good people.

726
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,689
They got a farm out in Abilene.

727
00:44:53,782 --> 00:44:57,781
They'd come to Hood, look after her kid
while we went out on exercises.

728
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,243
Yeah... Yeah.

729
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:03,032
OK.

730
00:45:03,126 --> 00:45:04,918
Thank you, Specialist.

731
00:45:05,004 --> 00:45:06,463
Thank you very much, sir.

732
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:14,386
I read somewhere...

733
00:45:14,473 --> 00:45:17,724
..that if a child doesn't see a person die,...

734
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,895
..or dead, like in a casket,...

735
00:45:20,981 --> 00:45:24,101
..that the person isn't really dead for them.

736
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,111
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

737
00:45:28,448 --> 00:45:29,479
Yes, ma'am.

738
00:45:31,493 --> 00:45:34,827
It was, uh... unusual, wasn't it,...

739
00:45:34,914 --> 00:45:37,583
..for Karen to want to be a helicopter pilot?

740
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:39,874
I guess that's my fault.

741
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:42,287
I took her to the fair when she was 11.

742
00:45:42,381 --> 00:45:45,667
12 - 7th grade.

743
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,547
Anyway, there was a helicopter there.

744
00:45:48,638 --> 00:45:50,714
Small one with a bubble up front.

745
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:53,381
The fella... the pilot was selling rides.

746
00:45:53,477 --> 00:45:56,182
I bought Karen a ticket.

747
00:45:56,272 --> 00:45:58,395
It was a short ride.

748
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:01,153
But when she came down...

749
00:46:01,236 --> 00:46:04,154
Well, I don't think
she ever came down, actually.

750
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:09,695
She showed up
at the dinner table one day,...

751
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:12,742
..just after she finished TCU.

752
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,743
She's joined the Army.

753
00:46:14,835 --> 00:46:16,663
She wants to fly helicopters.

754
00:46:16,754 --> 00:46:18,332
She's real stubborn about it, too.

755
00:46:18,423 --> 00:46:20,463
That's our Karen, you know, stubborn.

756
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,425
So is Anne Marie here.

757
00:46:25,014 --> 00:46:27,007
Come here, honey.

758
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,096
Excuse me.

759
00:46:35,067 --> 00:46:36,610
Uh, the young men,...

760
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:40,562
..the ones that came to tell us about Karen...

761
00:46:40,657 --> 00:46:43,231
..they were dressed just like you.

762
00:46:43,327 --> 00:46:46,115
Oh, I see.

763
00:46:46,205 --> 00:46:47,320
Major Teegarden,...

764
00:46:47,415 --> 00:46:51,995
..her commanding officer, he came, too,
when he came back from the Gulf.

765
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:55,791
Brought this photo back for Anne Marie.

766
00:46:57,302 --> 00:46:59,211
Meant a lot to us...

767
00:46:59,304 --> 00:47:01,262
..him coming to see us,...

768
00:47:01,348 --> 00:47:04,136
..telling us in person how Karen died.

769
00:47:04,227 --> 00:47:07,228
I lost men over there, too.

770
00:47:07,314 --> 00:47:08,808
I spoke to the major.

771
00:47:08,899 --> 00:47:13,977
Everybody thought the world
of your daughter. So did Specialist Ilario.

772
00:47:15,573 --> 00:47:17,862
It would sure help if I could see her letter.

773
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:19,861
I mean, if it's not too private.

774
00:47:19,953 --> 00:47:20,949
Letter?

775
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,280
From Ilario?

776
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:27,919
I’ll check my notes. Must be my mistake.

777
00:47:28,004 --> 00:47:29,748
This her husband here?

778
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,794
No. That's Karen's older brother Billy.

779
00:47:32,885 --> 00:47:35,459
Her husband's up in Michigan.

780
00:47:37,015 --> 00:47:40,182
He and Karen divorced
after only a year or so.

781
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:45,347
He never... well,... it was no picnic.

782
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:47,435
Karen raised Anne Marie on her own.

783
00:47:47,527 --> 00:47:51,312
We'd have been thrilled
to have Anne Marie with us all the time,...

784
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:54,823
..what with the Army and all.

785
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:56,904
But Karen was a real good mom.

786
00:47:58,081 --> 00:48:01,866
Never asked for help
unless she really needed it.

787
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:04,832
You can't imagine how hard it was for her...

788
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:08,375
..to go off and leave that Little girl
to fight in a war,...

789
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:11,803
..but it was important to Karen
to do her duty.

790
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,514
So she went.

791
00:48:39,004 --> 00:48:42,041
You've been out here 20 minutes
since I spotted you.

792
00:48:42,133 --> 00:48:44,803
- How much longer before that?
- 15.

793
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:50,922
I see you, uh...

794
00:48:51,018 --> 00:48:52,846
..got the new refrigerator.

795
00:48:52,937 --> 00:48:57,517
Do you think the kids will understand
why their daddy is out here in a Chevy...

796
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,730
..instead of playing with them
in the front yard?

797
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:03,527
Or at Fort Hood,
like you told me you were?

798
00:49:05,661 --> 00:49:06,906
Are you back?

799
00:49:08,038 --> 00:49:09,497
I'm in transit.

800
00:49:19,468 --> 00:49:21,960
You know, Nat, it took me a long time...

801
00:49:22,055 --> 00:49:25,887
..to figure out how to be an Army wife
without obliterating myself.

802
00:49:25,976 --> 00:49:27,934
It wasn't easy, but I did it.

803
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,097
I know you did, Mer.

804
00:49:31,149 --> 00:49:33,272
So it wouldn't be a hardship for me...

805
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,851
..to learn how not to be an Army wife...

806
00:49:35,946 --> 00:49:38,235
..if my husband wasn't in the Army any more.

807
00:49:38,324 --> 00:49:40,696
The Army's my life, Mer.

808
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:43,530
And so are we.

809
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:48,914
You don't have to figure it all out, Nat.

810
00:49:49,003 --> 00:49:52,503
You just have to admit that you can't.

811
00:49:54,259 --> 00:49:56,798
You have to want to be here with us,...

812
00:49:56,887 --> 00:49:57,919
..that's all.

813
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:02,761
We’ll be here.

814
00:50:05,981 --> 00:50:07,357
For a while.

815
00:50:19,163 --> 00:50:20,362
Now go away.

816
00:50:21,082 --> 00:50:24,416
If you're not going to stay,
I don't want the kids to see you.

817
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:33,764
This M-16, did it run out of ammo?

818
00:50:33,847 --> 00:50:35,757
Yes, sir?

819
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:39,930
- Colonel Serling, you can go in now.
- l don',t remember...

820
00:50:45,653 --> 00:50:47,231
Hey, Nat, what's up?

821
00:50:47,321 --> 00:50:48,732
General.

822
00:50:48,823 --> 00:50:52,407
It's the Walden file, sir.
One or two discrepancies.

823
00:50:52,494 --> 00:50:53,490
Discrepancies?

824
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:54,694
Yes, sir.

825
00:50:54,788 --> 00:50:57,790
I knew those White House clowns
were up to something.

826
00:50:57,875 --> 00:51:01,245
- If she doesn't deserve it, she won't get it.
- It's not Captain Walden, sir.

827
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:05,039
It's some of the details of the stories
I'm getting from her crew.

828
00:51:05,134 --> 00:51:08,634
- I don't know how significant...
- I'm drowning in paper here.

829
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:11,639
They're crawling all over my ass
for combat assessments,...

830
00:51:11,725 --> 00:51:16,969
Sir, I just wanted to let you know this is
not a rubber-stamp situation, that's all.

831
00:51:17,065 --> 00:51:21,608
Now, this specialist, uh, Ilario,
there's something funny about his story.

832
00:51:21,695 --> 00:51:25,230
We're not giving the medal to Ilario.
We're giving it to Walden.

833
00:51:25,324 --> 00:51:26,320
Roger.

834
00:51:26,409 --> 00:51:27,820
Splendid. Move forward.

835
00:51:27,911 --> 00:51:32,075
OK. The discrepancies specifically
relate to... use of an M-16 rifle...

836
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:35,831
Come on, Nat! No two eyewitnesses
ever agree on every detail.

837
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,913
You know that as well as I do.

838
00:51:38,006 --> 00:51:39,750
When do we get that report?

839
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:41,751
I want the White House off my back.

840
00:51:41,844 --> 00:51:43,219
A few days, sir.

841
00:51:43,304 --> 00:51:48,132
You agree that this report should be
as detailed and accurate as possible?

842
00:51:48,518 --> 00:51:50,558
Which means exactly what, Colonel?

843
00:51:50,646 --> 00:51:54,098
Which means exactly what I said, sir.

844
00:51:56,402 --> 00:52:00,982
Sorry, sir. This is the second copy
of Colonel Serling's Al Bathra deposition.

845
00:52:01,075 --> 00:52:04,526
The investigator seemed to have
misplaced the last one.

846
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,079
Rise above.

847
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,789
This will all be over soon.

848
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:12,289
Will there be
a public statement of the facts...

849
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,254
..when the investigation is over, sir?

850
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,718
There's been a decision not to release
any findings until every case...

851
00:52:18,804 --> 00:52:20,713
..has been thoroughly reviewed.

852
00:52:20,806 --> 00:52:23,843
Well, how long do you imagine
that will be, sir?

853
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:29,891
I mean, next time I see Lieutenant Boylar's
parents, I'd like to tell them the whole truth.

854
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:34,527
You know how many grieving parents
I had to deal with during Vietnam?

855
00:52:34,614 --> 00:52:35,645
This is not Vietnam.

856
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,991
Lieutenant Boylar's tank
was hit by uranium-depleted shells.

857
00:52:39,077 --> 00:52:42,529
We're the only country
in the world that uses them.

858
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:46,669
We got reporters from the Washington Post
looking for the truth,...

859
00:52:46,753 --> 00:52:49,291
..and the only person that knows it
can't say it...

860
00:52:49,381 --> 00:52:53,380
..because these investigators
are dragging their backsides!

861
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:57,717
Someone has got to be
accountable for this,... sir.

862
00:53:07,986 --> 00:53:09,362
Take a seat.

863
00:53:21,502 --> 00:53:25,168
Nat, I'm going to give you
all the rope in the world.

864
00:53:25,257 --> 00:53:27,499
First you imply I'm not interested...

865
00:53:27,593 --> 00:53:29,882
..in an accurate report on Captain Walden.

866
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:34,218
Now you're suggesting there must be
some cover-up going on about Al Bathra.

867
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:36,218
So how do you want me to respond?

868
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:38,269
As your commanding officer,...

869
00:53:38,355 --> 00:53:42,354
..or as your friend
who nursed you, pushed promotions,...

870
00:53:42,443 --> 00:53:45,813
..and fucking burped your kids
at their baptisms?

871
00:53:47,282 --> 00:53:49,322
Just how should I respond?

872
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,329
I'm sorry, sir.

873
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:55,740
I should hope by God you would be.

874
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,370
Now,...

875
00:53:58,462 --> 00:54:02,295
..losing a man like your friend Boylar,...

876
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:04,838
..I've been there.

877
00:54:06,388 --> 00:54:07,419
Well, this...

878
00:54:07,514 --> 00:54:09,424
..whole mess...

879
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:13,771
It's my ass on the line
right there beside yours.

880
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:17,439
I can feel the chilling the air
as well as you can.

881
00:54:17,526 --> 00:54:19,400
Yes, sir.

882
00:54:19,487 --> 00:54:22,025
And I know about the drinking.

883
00:54:22,198 --> 00:54:25,200
And if I have to write you up,...

884
00:54:25,285 --> 00:54:27,859
..it’ll just be one more bite out of your record.

885
00:54:27,955 --> 00:54:29,153
Clean it up.

886
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:31,740
Get yourself in a programme.

887
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,709
I’ll be looking for that report.

888
00:54:33,795 --> 00:54:35,338
Soon.

889
00:54:50,148 --> 00:54:53,849
- Yes, this is the Serling residence.
- We’re nothing right now...

890
00:54:53,944 --> 00:54:58,856
- But at the tone, leave a message and
we’ll call you when we get home.

891
00:55:22,561 --> 00:55:24,269
You better get your head into this!

892
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:28,187
I'm going to drop you
from this programme like a hot rock!

893
00:55:28,276 --> 00:55:29,818
You better hurry up!

894
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:34,650
Morning, sir. Monfriez is over there.
I’ll get him for you.

895
00:55:34,742 --> 00:55:35,691
Thank you.

896
00:55:35,784 --> 00:55:39,154
What the fuck are you doing, soldier?
Where are your men?

897
00:55:39,247 --> 00:55:41,619
- There, sir.
- Yeah? What do you call that?

898
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:43,368
You see that man?

899
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:46,996
You and he are brothers.
He depends on you. You depend on him.

900
00:55:47,089 --> 00:55:49,497
You never leave a man behind.

901
00:55:49,592 --> 00:55:52,926
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Now get the fuck out of here.

902
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:54,759
You were in Panama?

903
00:55:54,848 --> 00:55:56,473
Yes, sir.

904
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:57,840
Were you there, sir?

905
00:55:57,935 --> 00:55:59,478
Yes, I was.

906
00:55:59,562 --> 00:56:02,433
And you were also in Desert Storm?

907
00:56:02,524 --> 00:56:04,067
Roger that, sir.

908
00:56:05,569 --> 00:56:08,143
How'd you come to be
on Captain Walden's chopper?

909
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,861
I used to hang around the medivac unit.

910
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,529
Wanted to be a medic?

911
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,574
Wanted to hump a nurse once.
That count, sir?

912
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:18,739
See, I play poker.

913
00:56:18,835 --> 00:56:22,703
Those medivac folks, between missions,
had a lot of time on their hands.

914
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:24,625
Want to know a poker secret, sir?

915
00:56:24,717 --> 00:56:25,666
Always.

916
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:30,468
The people you play against,
find out what they're interested in.

917
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:31,968
Pretend you're interested.

918
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:36,722
They start running off at the mouth,
don't pay attention to their cards.

919
00:56:36,814 --> 00:56:40,599
Medevac folks,
they Love to talk about their choppers.

920
00:56:42,863 --> 00:56:44,655
Paid for this baby.

921
00:56:52,249 --> 00:56:54,076
So, talk to me about, um,...

922
00:56:54,168 --> 00:56:56,327
..25 February.

923
00:56:56,421 --> 00:56:58,877
25 February? Yes, sir.

924
00:57:01,427 --> 00:57:02,886
I had some phys rehab time.

925
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:04,512
Got into boxing.

926
00:57:04,597 --> 00:57:05,842
Want a soda pop?

927
00:57:05,932 --> 00:57:07,510
No, sir. No, I'm good.

928
00:57:08,685 --> 00:57:10,179
25 February.

929
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:12,144
So, 25 February...

930
00:57:13,482 --> 00:57:16,899
Major, uh, what's his butt? Garden party...

931
00:57:16,986 --> 00:57:18,611
Teegarden. Major Teegarden.

932
00:57:18,697 --> 00:57:22,481
Right. Asked me to go with Walden,
said she might need guns,...

933
00:57:22,576 --> 00:57:24,368
..so I said, you know, OK, why not?

934
00:57:24,454 --> 00:57:28,534
Grabbed me a saw, bungeed one of
the Huey doorways and away we went.

935
00:57:29,543 --> 00:57:31,287
Yeah.

936
00:57:31,378 --> 00:57:32,577
And, uh...

937
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,415
..the captain was a big hero...

938
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,220
She died tragically in the desert,
and Major...

939
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,548
- Teegarden.
- Teegarden...

940
00:57:39,638 --> 00:57:42,176
..wants her to get the Medal of Honour,
so she’ll get it.

941
00:57:42,266 --> 00:57:44,224
When did the M-16 ammo run out?

942
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:46,677
What?

943
00:57:46,771 --> 00:57:48,230
M-16 ammo?

944
00:57:48,315 --> 00:57:51,815
Blackhawk crew said
they heard M-16 fire during the rescue.

945
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:53,563
When did it run out?

946
00:57:54,197 --> 00:57:56,735
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.

947
00:57:56,825 --> 00:57:57,774
You wouldn't?

948
00:57:59,703 --> 00:58:01,780
As... as I recall, and, uh...

949
00:58:01,872 --> 00:58:03,367
..I'm not really sure,...

950
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:06,459
..but the M-16 ammo
ran out first thing in the morning.

951
00:58:06,545 --> 00:58:09,297
First thing in the morning.
But you're not really sure?

952
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:12,630
Now I'm confused.

953
00:58:12,718 --> 00:58:15,589
- You were there, weren't you?
- Affirmative, sir.

954
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,507
But I was on the saw.

955
00:58:19,727 --> 00:58:21,221
Altameyer would know, sir.

956
00:58:21,312 --> 00:58:22,343
Altameyer?

957
00:58:22,438 --> 00:58:26,271
- Yes, sir. He was manning the M-16.
- Oh, I see. OK.

958
00:58:27,319 --> 00:58:28,979
OK, let's back up, then.

959
00:58:29,071 --> 00:58:30,234
Um,...

960
00:58:30,322 --> 00:58:32,648
..when that tank fired on your chopper,...

961
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:34,320
..you said that, uh...

962
00:58:35,453 --> 00:58:39,452
..''You should go for altitude
and call for support'', right?

963
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:41,824
Sir?

964
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:43,711
You knew this wasn't Panama.

965
00:58:43,797 --> 00:58:46,798
Men were going to die,
so you wanted to get out, right?

966
00:58:46,883 --> 00:58:49,291
Wh... who told you that, sir?
Tea Party? Ilario?

967
00:58:49,386 --> 00:58:52,092
It doesn't matter who told me that.
You tell me.

968
00:58:59,732 --> 00:59:02,519
You don't want to know
what happened out there, sir.

969
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,069
Yes, I do.

970
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:06,823
You just want me to sign off on the story...

971
00:59:06,907 --> 00:59:10,111
..so you can finish your job
and the lady can get her medal.

972
00:59:12,163 --> 00:59:13,990
Are you refusing to tell me?

973
00:59:14,082 --> 00:59:17,000
Colonel, you know
what to do if you get a hang fire...

974
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:20,122
..when you pull the trigger
and the round doesn't go off?

975
00:59:20,214 --> 00:59:24,592
You wait, with your weapon pointed in
a safe direction, cos the primer burns slow.

976
00:59:24,678 --> 00:59:27,348
You open your weapon
and take the round out,...

977
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:28,890
..it blows up in your face.

978
00:59:30,434 --> 00:59:32,807
Leave this round in the chamber, Colonel.

979
00:59:37,568 --> 00:59:39,893
I work at the Pentagon, Sergeant,...

980
00:59:39,987 --> 00:59:42,823
..so I admit I'm a Little slow on the uptake.

981
00:59:42,907 --> 00:59:45,695
Otherwise I'd say you just threatened me.

982
00:59:47,997 --> 00:59:50,037
Did you just threaten me, soldier?

983
00:59:51,584 --> 00:59:54,372
Because, if you did, let me respond to you.

984
01:00:00,094 --> 01:00:02,134
Let me respond to you this way.

985
01:00:03,932 --> 01:00:07,551
I'm an officer, and therefore,
by proclamation, a gentleman,...

986
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,187
..but don't abuse that, son.

987
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,818
Don't get in my cross hairs,
because I’ll have no compunction...

988
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:16,690
..about getting up to my neck in your ass,
understand?

989
01:00:20,368 --> 01:00:22,444
She was afraid, Colonel.

990
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:26,370
That's the bottom line on Captain Walden.
She was a fucking coward, sir.

991
01:00:30,713 --> 01:00:32,541
Get me around so I can fire!

992
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:41,098
- Go back. Let me have another shot!
- I don't know.

993
01:00:41,184 --> 01:00:43,473
I'm going for altitude, call for support.

994
01:00:43,562 --> 01:00:44,475
There's no time!

995
01:00:46,107 --> 01:00:47,518
All right, one more!

996
01:00:47,608 --> 01:00:50,693
But then I'm calling for support.

997
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:54,444
Unhook the aux fuel cells!
Prepare to toss them overboard.

998
01:00:54,533 --> 01:00:55,944
Ilario, get me the flare gun.

999
01:00:56,035 --> 01:00:57,862
So it was your idea to use the fuel cell?

1000
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,069
Yeah.

1001
01:00:59,163 --> 01:01:00,658
Me, Rady, somebody.

1002
01:01:00,749 --> 01:01:04,699
Adrenaline was pumping. You can't
expect me to remember everything.

1003
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:05,993
Try.

1004
01:01:08,049 --> 01:01:09,424
Now!

1005
01:01:13,096 --> 01:01:15,089
- Yay!
- Whoo!

1006
01:01:16,225 --> 01:01:18,633
So what happened during the night?

1007
01:01:18,728 --> 01:01:20,306
Walden and Ilario,...

1008
01:01:20,397 --> 01:01:23,517
..they wouldn't shut up about being rescued.

1009
01:01:25,236 --> 01:01:27,608
Like the Army had nothing else to do.

1010
01:01:27,697 --> 01:01:29,690
Dust is blowing hard out there.

1011
01:01:29,783 --> 01:01:33,698
- Think they’ll find us tonight?
- AWACS lost us when the ADT got hit.

1012
01:01:33,787 --> 01:01:36,409
SOP is for search and rescue
to begin looking...

1013
01:01:36,499 --> 01:01:38,456
Christ, Captain, are you crying?

1014
01:01:38,543 --> 01:01:40,168
It's OK. It's just tension.

1015
01:01:40,253 --> 01:01:43,005
Hey, you're going to be OK, OK?

1016
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,917
They’ll find us. It’ll be OK.

1017
01:01:45,009 --> 01:01:48,877
I can hear the rag heads moving,
as soon as you girls stop gabbing.

1018
01:02:05,241 --> 01:02:06,783
They're going away.

1019
01:02:06,868 --> 01:02:08,243
It was just a probe.

1020
01:02:08,328 --> 01:02:10,617
- Shit!
- I'm OK.

1021
01:02:10,706 --> 01:02:12,533
- I took one.
- How's Rady?

1022
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:15,198
Hanging in. Captain?

1023
01:02:16,337 --> 01:02:18,911
Ah! Oh!

1024
01:02:21,385 --> 01:02:24,671
So the rest of the night
went without incident?

1025
01:02:26,432 --> 01:02:27,595
Yeah.

1026
01:02:27,684 --> 01:02:29,593
Wasn't that enough for one night?

1027
01:02:30,729 --> 01:02:32,769
You want to continue this tomorrow?

1028
01:02:35,276 --> 01:02:37,435
I don't get emotional about this shit.

1029
01:02:37,529 --> 01:02:39,154
I've been there, you know?

1030
01:02:40,657 --> 01:02:42,567
OK. Go on.

1031
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:45,745
Well, after the firefight, we argued mainly.

1032
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:50,623
Ilario was freaked out by the dark, and
Walden wanted to surrender at first light.

1033
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:55,371
She was a wreck, kept asking about
the ammo, worrying we didn't have enough.

1034
01:02:55,466 --> 01:02:57,341
I knew they'd attack at dawn.

1035
01:02:59,304 --> 01:03:02,341
So what happened during the evacuation?

1036
01:03:03,893 --> 01:03:05,471
Evacuation.

1037
01:03:09,817 --> 01:03:11,359
All right, let's go.

1038
01:03:11,444 --> 01:03:12,772
There's the rescue.

1039
01:03:16,491 --> 01:03:18,947
Altameyer, give me a hand with Rady.

1040
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:22,038
- Come on, Captain!
- Ow!

1041
01:03:22,123 --> 01:03:23,072
Come on!

1042
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:24,245
- No! Don't move me!
- Get away!

1043
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:25,448
Suck it up!

1044
01:03:25,543 --> 01:03:27,869
I got you covered! Ready?

1045
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:31,664
Go! Go! Go!

1046
01:03:33,928 --> 01:03:36,502
- Ilario, move!
- Not without the Captain!

1047
01:03:36,598 --> 01:03:37,927
I’ll get her.

1048
01:03:38,016 --> 01:03:40,342
No! I'm not leaving!

1049
01:03:40,436 --> 01:03:42,927
I'm not leaving! It's not safe!

1050
01:03:43,022 --> 01:03:45,858
They're taking fire!
The choppers are waiting!

1051
01:03:45,942 --> 01:03:47,567
No! No! No!

1052
01:03:57,998 --> 01:03:59,790
Get the fuck outta here!

1053
01:04:02,503 --> 01:04:03,914
Come on!

1054
01:04:05,632 --> 01:04:07,043
She fired at you?

1055
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:08,462
Near us, yeah.

1056
01:04:08,552 --> 01:04:13,049
Then why did you lie to the investigators
about how she performed?

1057
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:18,719
They'd already put together
their own bullshit version of the story...

1058
01:04:18,814 --> 01:04:23,192
..before they talked to me. I told them
what they wanted to hear. We all did.

1059
01:04:23,278 --> 01:04:28,984
But that's the truth, so forget about the
medal, or leave it as it is. I don't give a fuck.

1060
01:04:29,076 --> 01:04:33,538
So nobody from your Huey crew
fired an M-16 any time during the rescue?

1061
01:04:33,623 --> 01:04:35,248
That's affirmed, sir.

1062
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:36,709
Monfriez, you ready?

1063
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:41,673
You sure about that?

1064
01:04:41,758 --> 01:04:44,427
That's affirmative, sir.

1065
01:04:44,511 --> 01:04:46,136
We had no ammo.

1066
01:04:51,895 --> 01:04:53,270
So how about it, Colonel?

1067
01:04:53,355 --> 01:04:55,312
Want to go a few rounds?

1068
01:04:55,399 --> 01:04:57,522
Are you threatening me, soldier?

1069
01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:00,018
- Where's your brain bucket?
- I don't need it.

1070
01:05:00,113 --> 01:05:01,773
Don't step in here without one.

1071
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:06,658
I have to tell you again,
you won't have a head to stick it on.

1072
01:05:06,745 --> 01:05:09,581
Come on, Jersey. Right here.

1073
01:05:09,665 --> 01:05:11,041
Let's see what you got.

1074
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:13,000
You got nothing, man.

1075
01:05:14,129 --> 01:05:15,623
Come on!

1076
01:05:25,893 --> 01:05:28,100
- Hello.
- Hello? Baby?

1077
01:05:28,187 --> 01:05:29,516
How're you doing?

1078
01:05:29,605 --> 01:05:31,314
Hi.

1079
01:05:34,528 --> 01:05:36,272
How's it going?

1080
01:05:36,363 --> 01:05:37,739
Outstanding.

1081
01:05:38,991 --> 01:05:40,190
Outstanding.

1082
01:05:40,285 --> 01:05:42,990
I was calling, I wondered...

1083
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,360
What... what kind of...

1084
01:05:44,456 --> 01:05:46,414
What size T-shirts the kids wear?

1085
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,540
I want to get the kids some T-shirts.

1086
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,836
You know their sizes as well as I do.

1087
01:05:52,924 --> 01:05:54,834
Are you OK?

1088
01:05:56,303 --> 01:05:57,335
Nat?

1089
01:05:59,515 --> 01:06:02,185
I got a pint of, um...

1090
01:06:02,269 --> 01:06:04,475
..Scotch here in a paper bag.

1091
01:06:06,232 --> 01:06:08,141
I don't want to drink any of it.

1092
01:06:10,236 --> 01:06:12,395
Can you tell me why you need it?

1093
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:21,452
Want me to prattle on for a minute?
I can do that.

1094
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:22,490
Please.

1095
01:06:22,584 --> 01:06:25,455
OK. Um...

1096
01:06:25,546 --> 01:06:27,040
The new refrigerator doesn't work.

1097
01:06:27,131 --> 01:06:29,457
The light doesn't come on
when you open the door.

1098
01:06:29,551 --> 01:06:34,629
I had to drive all the way
over to Wagner, 12 blocks,...

1099
01:06:34,723 --> 01:06:37,641
..just so that Brian could practice
riding his bike.

1100
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:40,053
He's afraid of falling in front of his friends.

1101
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:45,482
He refuses to let anyone
see him riding with training wheels.

1102
01:06:47,071 --> 01:06:51,152
They've both taken to sleeping in our bed
since you left.

1103
01:06:52,536 --> 01:06:54,992
It's like sleeping between two tornadoes.

1104
01:06:55,081 --> 01:06:56,824
I better go, baby.

1105
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:58,327
Don Boylar called.

1106
01:06:58,418 --> 01:06:59,829
Jesus.

1107
01:07:01,088 --> 01:07:02,416
I better go.

1108
01:07:02,506 --> 01:07:05,044
- Nat, talk to me.
- I can't.

1109
01:07:05,134 --> 01:07:06,676
- Why not?
- I can't!

1110
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:08,837
Bullshit. Bull! Talk to me!

1111
01:07:16,648 --> 01:07:18,142
Oh, Christ.

1112
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:20,517
Colonel?

1113
01:07:20,611 --> 01:07:22,070
Colonel?

1114
01:07:30,581 --> 01:07:32,787
Can we get some coffee, please?

1115
01:07:37,046 --> 01:07:38,624
You're not a happy man.

1116
01:07:39,967 --> 01:07:42,458
A woman? The Army?

1117
01:07:42,553 --> 01:07:43,668
Al Bathra?

1118
01:07:55,568 --> 01:07:57,312
Talk to me.

1119
01:07:57,404 --> 01:07:59,195
Off the record, if you want.

1120
01:07:59,281 --> 01:08:00,692
Way, way off the record.

1121
01:08:00,783 --> 01:08:02,277
Rangers' honour.

1122
01:08:04,787 --> 01:08:05,819
Serling,...

1123
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:09,518
How long you been back?

1124
01:08:11,527 --> 01:08:12,773
Six months.

1125
01:08:12,862 --> 01:08:15,436
And you...
you've been in the service how long?

1126
01:08:15,532 --> 01:08:16,813
17 years.

1127
01:08:16,909 --> 01:08:20,243
Ah, they got me running this inquiry...

1128
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:23,117
..on this girl pilot.

1129
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:24,702
Captain Karen Walden.

1130
01:08:24,793 --> 01:08:29,255
She’ll be the first woman
to get the Medal of Honour for combat.

1131
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:30,170
Oh, boy.

1132
01:08:30,258 --> 01:08:33,841
And everybody in the beltway
wants a piece of this one, right?

1133
01:08:35,347 --> 01:08:37,803
I just want to get something clear.

1134
01:08:37,892 --> 01:08:40,562
This time, just want somebody to be a hero.

1135
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,729
I want to get something right.

1136
01:08:43,815 --> 01:08:44,764
Yeah.

1137
01:08:44,858 --> 01:08:47,432
Cos Al Bathra, you know...

1138
01:08:52,742 --> 01:08:53,691
Al Bathra.

1139
01:08:53,785 --> 01:08:55,778
You talked to Boylar's parents?

1140
01:08:55,871 --> 01:08:56,986
Yeah.

1141
01:08:57,081 --> 01:08:58,659
Do they know?

1142
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:01,993
They heard from a few of his friends.

1143
01:09:02,087 --> 01:09:05,172
Aw, Jesus...

1144
01:09:05,257 --> 01:09:06,289
You know...

1145
01:09:07,927 --> 01:09:11,094
They told Boylar's parents
he died from enemy fire.

1146
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:12,972
I told them that.

1147
01:09:13,058 --> 01:09:16,344
I carried the message,
went to the funeral,...

1148
01:09:16,437 --> 01:09:18,893
..watched his mother cry her eyes out.

1149
01:09:18,982 --> 01:09:21,817
I stood there
and looked his father in the eye...

1150
01:09:21,902 --> 01:09:25,402
..and told him
his son died brave under fire.

1151
01:09:25,489 --> 01:09:28,823
And I was the one
who gave the order to fire.

1152
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:30,452
I did it.

1153
01:09:30,537 --> 01:09:33,538
Then the Army gave me a medal...

1154
01:09:33,624 --> 01:09:35,866
..for bravery and valour.

1155
01:09:37,378 --> 01:09:40,083
Then they buried me...

1156
01:09:40,173 --> 01:09:41,549
..in medals.

1157
01:09:43,093 --> 01:09:45,086
Got a sense of humour, don't they?

1158
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:51,136
Yeah.

1159
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:56,223
Can't remember anything else
except being in the Army.

1160
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:01,484
Either being in it or wanting to be in it.

1161
01:10:04,827 --> 01:10:06,321
It's all I know.

1162
01:10:12,002 --> 01:10:13,710
Look, you need to sleep.

1163
01:10:13,796 --> 01:10:15,076
You call me any time.

1164
01:10:15,172 --> 01:10:19,253
Anything you want to say about anything,
on or off the record.

1165
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:23,093
I'm going to leave you alone for a while.

1166
01:10:29,314 --> 01:10:34,356
Ilario. Are you saying you can't find him,
or that he's absent without leave?

1167
01:10:34,445 --> 01:10:36,319
Sir, that’s an l... l...

1168
01:10:36,406 --> 01:10:38,233
That's right, specialist Ilario.

1169
01:10:38,325 --> 01:10:40,282
Well, we contacted the MPs, sir...

1170
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,445
Roger.

1171
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:44,080
Roger that.

1172
01:10:44,248 --> 01:10:46,040
Thank you.

1173
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:50,788
Did she display fear when she had
to make these life-and-death decisions?

1174
01:10:50,881 --> 01:10:53,455
No, never.

1175
01:10:53,551 --> 01:10:56,718
Karen,... the captain... she had this quality.

1176
01:10:56,805 --> 01:10:58,762
The heavier the pressure,
the calmer she got.

1177
01:10:58,849 --> 01:11:03,013
And she... you know, she put up
with a lot of shit to become an officer.

1178
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:07,608
Had to work twice as hard
as everybody else, be twice as good.

1179
01:11:07,692 --> 01:11:11,192
She’d never let the guard down,
show any sign of weakness.

1180
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,484
But she was tough. She could handle it.

1181
01:11:14,575 --> 01:11:17,992
So, ladies and gentlemen,
what I have to say to you in closing...

1182
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:19,907
..is to go forth,...

1183
01:11:19,998 --> 01:11:22,205
..to command wisely,...

1184
01:11:22,293 --> 01:11:24,084
..to advise prudently,...

1185
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:26,293
..to protect with vigilance...

1186
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:28,837
..and to judge with care.

1187
01:11:28,926 --> 01:11:31,251
And above all,...

1188
01:11:31,345 --> 01:11:34,845
..to defend with all your heart,
all your soul...

1189
01:11:34,933 --> 01:11:36,890
..and all your courage...

1190
01:11:36,977 --> 01:11:41,022
..the lives of the men and women
under your command,...

1191
01:11:41,106 --> 01:11:43,396
..and the United States of America.

1192
01:11:45,528 --> 01:11:49,277
Are you now saying
you’ll report against her getting the medal?

1193
01:11:49,366 --> 01:11:53,115
As I explained to the White House,
there should be a further investigation...

1194
01:11:53,204 --> 01:11:54,912
..before we move forward.
The discrepancies...

1195
01:11:54,998 --> 01:11:57,916
Another matter completely.
Write up a second report.

1196
01:11:58,001 --> 01:11:59,544
That's my point, sir!

1197
01:11:59,628 --> 01:12:02,001
Ilario's disappeared. Altameyer's missing.

1198
01:12:02,089 --> 01:12:04,663
- Who?
- Altameyer, sir. Walden's crew chief.

1199
01:12:04,759 --> 01:12:06,669
VA hospital's transferred him out
three weeks ago.

1200
01:12:06,762 --> 01:12:08,386
Paperwork's missing.

1201
01:12:08,472 --> 01:12:09,931
Doesn't he have any family?

1202
01:12:10,015 --> 01:12:11,011
Negative.

1203
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,844
Fucking VA. We can't wait, Nat.

1204
01:12:12,935 --> 01:12:16,186
You cannot imagine
the kind of heat I'm getting on this.

1205
01:12:16,273 --> 01:12:17,815
Everybody wants it.

1206
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:22,977
Senators, congressmen, one shiny
piece of something for people to believe in.

1207
01:12:24,157 --> 01:12:25,438
Whole episode.

1208
01:12:25,534 --> 01:12:27,111
Walden or Al Bathra?

1209
01:12:27,202 --> 01:12:28,745
Both, damn it, both.

1210
01:12:29,538 --> 01:12:30,819
Submit your report today.

1211
01:12:30,957 --> 01:12:31,988
I'm sorry, sir.

1212
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,665
I won't put my name
on an incomplete report.

1213
01:12:36,755 --> 01:12:40,588
May I remind you who recommended you
for this when no-one else 'd touch you?

1214
01:12:40,676 --> 01:12:43,631
You saying you chose me
because I wouldn't rock the boat?

1215
01:12:43,722 --> 01:12:47,423
Dereliction of duty,
drunk and disorderly, conduct unbecoming.

1216
01:12:47,518 --> 01:12:49,060
At best, a dishonorable discharge.

1217
01:12:49,145 --> 01:12:52,229
At worst, Al Bathra gives us
plenty of grounds, if we want 'em.

1218
01:12:52,315 --> 01:12:55,269
At least somebody has finally said it.

1219
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:59,359
Nat, don't do this. I could give you
a direct order to submit your report.

1220
01:12:59,448 --> 01:13:00,729
Yes, you could.

1221
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:11,706
Put Hillerman back on the Walden file!

1222
01:13:11,838 --> 01:13:15,124
I handed this to you, Nat, as a way back.

1223
01:13:15,217 --> 01:13:17,424
You could've had one hell of a career.

1224
01:13:18,971 --> 01:13:21,260
And you give Meredith my best.

1225
01:13:21,349 --> 01:13:23,508
Tell her I didn't have any choice.

1226
01:13:23,602 --> 01:13:27,137
I'm going to finish this report.

1227
01:13:27,231 --> 01:13:28,773
On my own, if I have to.

1228
01:13:28,858 --> 01:13:32,227
I'm going to get this one right.

1229
01:13:44,126 --> 01:13:45,406
You want one?

1230
01:13:45,502 --> 01:13:46,997
No, thank you.

1231
01:13:47,087 --> 01:13:52,427
Why is it people never want to eat
when they got something important to say?

1232
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:54,883
I always want to eat.

1233
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,971
Need you to help me find somebody.

1234
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:02,640
You want my help?

1235
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:05,602
Yeah.
Name's Altameyer. Steven Altameyer.

1236
01:14:06,527 --> 01:14:10,775
He was the crew chief on the medivac
chopper, piloted by Karen Walden.

1237
01:14:10,865 --> 01:14:14,365
- One supposed to get a Medal of Honour?
- The very one.

1238
01:14:14,453 --> 01:14:19,032
- The Army's usually tidy about its people.
- Yeah, usually, but not this time.

1239
01:14:20,126 --> 01:14:23,994
First he demobbed,
then they had him in a VA hospital.

1240
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:27,209
They transferred him.
Now no-one can find him.

1241
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:29,045
Why do you need me?

1242
01:14:29,137 --> 01:14:31,759
Can't someone in the Pentagon help?

1243
01:14:31,848 --> 01:14:33,640
I'm out of the loop.

1244
01:14:33,725 --> 01:14:35,599
Somebody pissed at you?

1245
01:14:38,147 --> 01:14:40,935
- I'm out of the loop.
- Somebody important?

1246
01:14:41,026 --> 01:14:43,647
- You want to help me or not?
- Hey, who called who here?

1247
01:14:46,365 --> 01:14:47,860
Yeah, sure, I’ll help.

1248
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:50,027
Just tell me why I'm doing it.

1249
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,572
When you go after stories,
you want them to be right, yes?

1250
01:14:53,665 --> 01:14:54,614
Yeah.

1251
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:55,740
So do I.

1252
01:14:56,794 --> 01:14:58,372
OK.

1253
01:14:58,463 --> 01:15:02,082
So, I help you find this Altameyer,...

1254
01:15:02,175 --> 01:15:04,583
..and in return...?

1255
01:15:11,561 --> 01:15:13,020
There's a tape.

1256
01:15:14,231 --> 01:15:16,723
Sweet Jesus. There's always a tape.

1257
01:15:16,818 --> 01:15:18,857
- Do you want to hear this?
- Yeah.

1258
01:15:18,945 --> 01:15:20,488
Yeah, go on.

1259
01:15:20,614 --> 01:15:26,155
There's a tape of all communications
between our tanks that night in Al Bathra.

1260
01:15:26,454 --> 01:15:29,124
Are they trying to make it disappear?

1261
01:15:29,207 --> 01:15:33,336
I don't think so, but they're not
advertising its existence, either.

1262
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:34,701
The Army and its image.

1263
01:15:39,219 --> 01:15:41,841
Where do I reach you
when I find this Altameyer?

1264
01:15:42,014 --> 01:15:43,425
The Bethesda Arms.

1265
01:15:43,516 --> 01:15:44,465
A motel?

1266
01:15:44,558 --> 01:15:48,473
- Bet everything's great in your life.
- Outstanding.

1267
01:15:48,563 --> 01:15:50,141
Serling,...

1268
01:15:50,232 --> 01:15:51,726
..eat something.

1269
01:15:51,817 --> 01:15:53,525
You look awful.

1270
01:16:16,262 --> 01:16:18,469
# Make me an angel

1271
01:16:18,723 --> 01:16:22,175
# Flies from Montgomery

1272
01:16:23,646 --> 01:16:26,564
# Make me a poster

1273
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:29,984
# From an old rodeo

1274
01:16:31,238 --> 01:16:34,109
# Just give me one thing

1275
01:16:35,285 --> 01:16:39,117
# That I can hold on to

1276
01:16:40,457 --> 01:16:43,993
# To believe in this living’

1277
01:16:44,087 --> 01:16:45,996
# It's just a...

1278
01:16:46,089 --> 01:16:49,209
# Hard way to go

1279
01:16:50,678 --> 01:16:53,964
# To believe in this living’

1280
01:16:54,057 --> 01:16:55,255
# It's just a...

1281
01:16:56,685 --> 01:16:58,974
# Hard way

1282
01:16:59,062 --> 01:17:02,147
# To go

1283
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:11,275
Hello.

1284
01:17:11,369 --> 01:17:12,828
Found Altameyer.

1285
01:17:13,121 --> 01:17:14,200
Got any complaints?

1286
01:17:14,289 --> 01:17:15,487
Excuse me?

1287
01:17:15,582 --> 01:17:17,824
Rashes, fatigue, bleeding gums,...

1288
01:17:17,918 --> 01:17:21,252
..muscle and joint pain,
loss of weight, loss of appetite,...

1289
01:17:21,339 --> 01:17:25,835
..insomnia, reactions to bright sunlight.
You name it, we're seeing it.

1290
01:17:25,927 --> 01:17:27,801
I drink too much. Does that count?

1291
01:17:27,888 --> 01:17:29,632
Hell, we all drink too much.

1292
01:17:29,723 --> 01:17:31,266
Here he is.

1293
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:34,386
Altameyer, you want a shave?

1294
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:38,400
Gentleman here to see you.
You want a shave?

1295
01:17:38,484 --> 01:17:39,978
What's wrong with him?

1296
01:17:40,069 --> 01:17:42,394
Abdominal cancer.
That's what's killing him.

1297
01:17:42,488 --> 01:17:44,612
There's many things wrong with him.

1298
01:17:44,699 --> 01:17:47,784
He's never awake very long
with all the pain.

1299
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:49,613
I’ll leave you two, then.

1300
01:17:49,705 --> 01:17:50,950
Thank you.

1301
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:54,954
How you doing, Steven?

1302
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,832
I'm Colonel Serling.

1303
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,299
Nat Serling.

1304
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:03,464
I want to talk to you
about Captain Karen Walden.

1305
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:08,427
They want to give her
the Medal of Honour,...

1306
01:18:08,519 --> 01:18:12,268
..and I know
that you were there in Al Kufan with her.

1307
01:18:12,357 --> 01:18:13,732
Roger?

1308
01:18:15,944 --> 01:18:17,902
I was...

1309
01:18:17,988 --> 01:18:19,269
..hit.

1310
01:18:19,365 --> 01:18:20,907
In the back.

1311
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,114
Roger.

1312
01:18:23,203 --> 01:18:25,361
But you were still able to get Rady out.

1313
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:29,239
Rady.

1314
01:18:29,377 --> 01:18:30,705
Yeah.

1315
01:18:30,795 --> 01:18:32,788
Good man Rady.

1316
01:18:37,219 --> 01:18:39,711
I was...

1317
01:18:39,805 --> 01:18:41,348
..afraid.

1318
01:18:41,432 --> 01:18:43,390
I understand, son.

1319
01:18:47,648 --> 01:18:48,929
That's OK. Take your time.

1320
01:18:49,025 --> 01:18:50,305
She was afraid.

1321
01:18:50,401 --> 01:18:53,356
She... she was afraid.

1322
01:18:53,446 --> 01:18:55,238
The Captain was afraid?

1323
01:18:57,034 --> 01:18:58,445
Not...

1324
01:19:00,663 --> 01:19:02,158
..the Captain.

1325
01:19:02,248 --> 01:19:04,407
Who then? Was it Rady or Ilario?

1326
01:19:04,543 --> 01:19:05,871
Was Ilario afraid?

1327
01:19:08,047 --> 01:19:09,839
Me.

1328
01:19:13,428 --> 01:19:16,133
Did... didn't tell.

1329
01:19:17,475 --> 01:19:19,432
You didn't tell what, son?

1330
01:19:22,022 --> 01:19:23,481
The major.

1331
01:19:26,068 --> 01:19:27,942
Monfriez.

1332
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:29,856
You didn't tell the major Monfriez...

1333
01:19:30,114 --> 01:19:32,902
You...
you and Monfriez didn't tell the major?

1334
01:19:32,993 --> 01:19:34,404
He...

1335
01:19:34,495 --> 01:19:36,701
..and then they...

1336
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:40,996
You and Monfriez didn't tell the major.

1337
01:19:44,465 --> 01:19:46,504
You and Monfriez what, Steven?

1338
01:19:48,094 --> 01:19:49,423
Oh, Jesus.

1339
01:19:49,596 --> 01:19:50,841
What? What is it?

1340
01:19:50,931 --> 01:19:52,923
Tell me son, please. What is it?

1341
01:19:53,141 --> 01:19:54,007
Jesus.

1342
01:19:54,101 --> 01:19:55,050
What? What?

1343
01:19:55,144 --> 01:19:56,424
The fire.

1344
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,391
- What? What fire?
- Oh, Jesus, the fire.

1345
01:20:00,025 --> 01:20:00,807
What fire?

1346
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:02,181
The napalm fire?

1347
01:20:02,361 --> 01:20:03,226
Jesus.

1348
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,728
- You see the napalm fire.
- Jesus.

1349
01:20:05,823 --> 01:20:07,282
Tell me about the fire.

1350
01:20:07,366 --> 01:20:10,783
You and Monfriez
didn't tell the major what about the fire?

1351
01:20:11,037 --> 01:20:12,865
- Please, Jesus.
- Steven!

1352
01:20:12,956 --> 01:20:13,988
Jesus, please.

1353
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:16,408
Is it napalm fire? Steven?

1354
01:20:16,544 --> 01:20:17,457
Please, Jesus.

1355
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:18,494
Jesus, please.

1356
01:20:18,588 --> 01:20:19,703
Steven.

1357
01:20:20,966 --> 01:20:22,875
Jesus.

1358
01:20:22,968 --> 01:20:24,047
Please.

1359
01:20:24,261 --> 01:20:25,839
Jesus.

1360
01:20:26,097 --> 01:20:27,176
What's he doing?

1361
01:20:27,265 --> 01:20:29,388
He's upping his meds. Self-medication.

1362
01:20:29,517 --> 01:20:31,391
Well, can you get him to stop?

1363
01:20:31,478 --> 01:20:34,016
I mean, I need to talk to him.

1364
01:20:34,273 --> 01:20:36,764
Give him a break.
He's feeling no pain now.

1365
01:20:51,794 --> 01:20:52,493
Left.

1366
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:53,535
Left.

1367
01:20:53,629 --> 01:20:54,578
Left.

1368
01:20:54,672 --> 01:20:55,621
Left.

1369
01:20:55,715 --> 01:20:58,550
Get off my car, sir.

1370
01:21:04,141 --> 01:21:06,715
Think you got
something to tell me, Sergeant.

1371
01:21:06,811 --> 01:21:08,187
I called around.

1372
01:21:08,271 --> 01:21:10,763
You're off this inquiry, so why you here?

1373
01:21:10,858 --> 01:21:12,566
Karen Walden sent me.

1374
01:21:17,157 --> 01:21:19,196
I just left Altameyer.

1375
01:21:24,582 --> 01:21:27,500
What happened out there
that was so bad...

1376
01:21:27,585 --> 01:21:32,497
..that it would have Altameyer
laying up in a hospital praying to die,...

1377
01:21:32,591 --> 01:21:34,631
..that's got Ilario on the run?

1378
01:21:36,221 --> 01:21:37,929
That's right, he went AWOL.

1379
01:21:38,014 --> 01:21:42,143
What do you think he’ll tell them about you
when they catch him?

1380
01:21:42,228 --> 01:21:44,137
And they're going to catch him, son.

1381
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:46,104
Now, you can tell them,...

1382
01:21:46,191 --> 01:21:47,982
..or you can tell me.

1383
01:21:49,027 --> 01:21:50,901
What happened out there?

1384
01:21:50,988 --> 01:21:52,648
Nothing happened.

1385
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:56,151
Nothing happened, sir.

1386
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,652
It was a war.

1387
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,958
Don't lie to me, soldier.

1388
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,920
Don't lie to me.

1389
01:22:07,257 --> 01:22:10,342
It doesn't matter
whether she gets this award or not.

1390
01:22:10,427 --> 01:22:14,473
It doesn't matter whether I'm on this inquiry
or whether I'm in this Army.

1391
01:22:14,557 --> 01:22:18,721
I'm going to find out the truth.
I guarantee you that.

1392
01:22:18,812 --> 01:22:23,356
You said you were a good poker player.
Well, look me in the eye.

1393
01:22:23,443 --> 01:22:25,067
You think I'm bluffing?

1394
01:22:31,452 --> 01:22:32,828
No, thank you.

1395
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,622
You want it.

1396
01:22:35,707 --> 01:22:39,871
I can smell how much you want it.
It's coming out of your pores.

1397
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:47,802
Tell me about the fire.

1398
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:49,639
I like trains.

1399
01:22:50,683 --> 01:22:52,640
Since I was a kid.

1400
01:22:52,727 --> 01:22:54,008
Big...

1401
01:22:54,104 --> 01:22:55,099
Tough...

1402
01:22:55,355 --> 01:22:56,434
Iron.

1403
01:22:56,523 --> 01:22:58,017
Used to be iron, anyway.

1404
01:22:58,108 --> 01:23:02,818
When I got to boxing pro, I was going to
call myself Johnny ''Night Train'' Monfriez.

1405
01:23:02,906 --> 01:23:06,026
- Don't that have a nice ring to it?
- Very nice.

1406
01:23:06,118 --> 01:23:09,072
Don't humour me, man.
Say it like you mean it.

1407
01:23:09,163 --> 01:23:11,915
Don't humour me, either.
Tell me about the fire.

1408
01:23:12,709 --> 01:23:14,536
Where's my other bottle?

1409
01:23:18,716 --> 01:23:22,845
You ever kill anyone
at close range with a small arm, sir?

1410
01:23:22,929 --> 01:23:24,721
It's messy.

1411
01:23:33,358 --> 01:23:34,687
No.

1412
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:36,271
We're not talking...

1413
01:23:36,361 --> 01:23:38,651
..one of your great big tank guns here.

1414
01:23:38,739 --> 01:23:40,697
Oh, that's OK.

1415
01:23:40,783 --> 01:23:42,657
I know what you did.

1416
01:23:42,744 --> 01:23:44,286
Your own men.

1417
01:23:44,371 --> 01:23:46,578
Guys under your command.

1418
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:49,582
How'd it feel?

1419
01:23:49,669 --> 01:23:51,044
Bad, right?

1420
01:23:51,129 --> 01:23:52,623
Very bad, son.

1421
01:23:52,714 --> 01:23:53,710
Very bad.

1422
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,919
And you didn't even mean to kill them.

1423
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:03,807
I've been a good soldier.

1424
01:24:04,937 --> 01:24:07,510
A good soldier.

1425
01:24:10,818 --> 01:24:13,025
Listen to that whistle.

1426
01:24:14,114 --> 01:24:16,688
Johnny ''Night Train'' Monfriez.

1427
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:18,983
Say it.

1428
01:24:20,038 --> 01:24:23,074
Johnny ''Night Train'' Monfriez.

1429
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,831
Now get out.

1430
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:29,958
You don't want to do this, son.

1431
01:24:30,049 --> 01:24:31,129
Let me help you.

1432
01:24:31,217 --> 01:24:34,302
- It's too late.
- It's never too late. Look at me.

1433
01:24:34,388 --> 01:24:37,757
Things get fucked up in war.
I don't care what happened to you.

1434
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:38,882
You can't do this.

1435
01:24:38,976 --> 01:24:39,972
Wrong!

1436
01:24:41,605 --> 01:24:43,763
I can't do anything else.

1437
01:24:43,857 --> 01:24:47,903
Yes, you can. You can put the car in reverse.
Put the gun down.

1438
01:24:47,987 --> 01:24:49,268
We can help each other.

1439
01:24:51,449 --> 01:24:54,404
I don't want to lose another good soldier.

1440
01:24:59,876 --> 01:25:01,916
I strongly urge you...

1441
01:25:02,003 --> 01:25:04,210
..to dismount the vehicle, sir.

1442
01:25:22,819 --> 01:25:24,397
Monfriez. Monfriez!

1443
01:25:39,297 --> 01:25:42,299
Aah!

1444
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:03,813
imagine that.

1445
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:07,445
imagine not thinking
about the consequences.

1446
01:26:07,539 --> 01:26:11,240
it’s not the doing shit that gets to you,
it’s the consequences.

1447
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,460
My folks used to have this place
out on Calaveras Lake.

1448
01:26:15,548 --> 01:26:17,505
l still go there sometimes.

1449
01:26:20,554 --> 01:26:24,386
Guess you told me about this place
so I'd know where to find you.

1450
01:26:24,475 --> 01:26:26,551
It's beautiful.

1451
01:26:31,942 --> 01:26:33,852
The MPs at Fort Stewart...

1452
01:26:33,945 --> 01:26:36,518
..found your stash in your locker.

1453
01:26:40,953 --> 01:26:43,871
Pretty ingenious place to keep it, huh?

1454
01:26:44,957 --> 01:26:47,531
Not if you wanted it to be found.

1455
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:52,338
Where'd you hide the needle tracks?

1456
01:26:52,591 --> 01:26:53,920
I, uh...

1457
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:57,095
I shoot up between my toes.

1458
01:26:59,391 --> 01:27:01,016
Monfriez is dead.

1459
01:27:01,143 --> 01:27:03,302
Killed himself.

1460
01:27:03,604 --> 01:27:05,478
Altameyer is dying.

1461
01:27:11,572 --> 01:27:13,114
Aren't we all?

1462
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:17,486
Mayday! Mayday!
Dustoff-3, we're going down!

1463
01:27:17,579 --> 01:27:19,038
We're going down! Mayday!

1464
01:27:19,122 --> 01:27:22,124
Mayday! Mayday!
Dustoff-3, we're going down!

1465
01:27:22,209 --> 01:27:23,490
We're going down!

1466
01:27:23,586 --> 01:27:24,997
We're going down!

1467
01:27:26,631 --> 01:27:28,790
And the chopper went down?

1468
01:27:28,884 --> 01:27:30,047
What happened next?

1469
01:27:30,177 --> 01:27:34,507
What happened next isn't important.
It's what happened that night.

1470
01:27:34,599 --> 01:27:36,972
Monfriez wanted to make a run for it.

1471
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:39,931
At dawn we're dead.
They’ll have reinforcements.

1472
01:27:40,022 --> 01:27:41,896
Escape and evasion, Captain.

1473
01:27:43,735 --> 01:27:47,235
Now's the time to do it.
Maybe we'd slip by them in the dark.

1474
01:27:47,364 --> 01:27:48,693
I told you,...

1475
01:27:48,782 --> 01:27:50,526
..Rady can't be moved.

1476
01:27:50,743 --> 01:27:51,774
Right, Ilario?

1477
01:27:51,869 --> 01:27:55,618
That lung - any movement may kill him.
But he may die lying here.

1478
01:27:55,707 --> 01:27:58,115
You see?
Rady will never make it. I say we go.

1479
01:28:02,882 --> 01:28:04,542
Oh, great.

1480
01:28:04,634 --> 01:28:06,592
Great. The Captain's crying.

1481
01:28:06,678 --> 01:28:09,430
It's just tension, asshole.

1482
01:28:10,725 --> 01:28:12,967
It doesn't mean shit.

1483
01:28:13,144 --> 01:28:16,229
Come on, Captain.
I don't want to wait here to die.

1484
01:28:20,069 --> 01:28:21,184
Ilario?

1485
01:28:24,783 --> 01:28:27,488
- I don't know.
- Come on, it's a majority.

1486
01:28:27,578 --> 01:28:31,161
That'd be great if this was a democracy,
but it isn't.

1487
01:28:31,457 --> 01:28:33,118
We stay with Rady.

1488
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,748
I wouldn't risk your life. I won't risk his.

1489
01:28:36,922 --> 01:28:39,544
So if we surrender,
the Iraqis would doctor him up.

1490
01:28:39,842 --> 01:28:41,337
No surrender.

1491
01:28:44,723 --> 01:28:46,265
I hear something moving.

1492
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:50,348
- I say we make for the chopper now.
- And I say I heard enough of that shit.

1493
01:28:50,438 --> 01:28:53,309
You don't have to go.
We don't need your permission.

1494
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,309
I am in command here!

1495
01:28:55,402 --> 01:28:57,359
Well, maybe not any more.

1496
01:29:01,701 --> 01:29:03,659
Give me the saw, Monfriez.

1497
01:29:03,745 --> 01:29:07,993
I can't stop you from running, but
you're not taking our fire power with you.

1498
01:29:09,919 --> 01:29:11,912
You're not taking away my weapon.

1499
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:18,302
Yes, I am.

1500
01:29:19,555 --> 01:29:22,094
Hey, I can make a white flag, all right?

1501
01:29:22,434 --> 01:29:25,352
There's no way
you're taking away my weapon, cunt.

1502
01:29:25,437 --> 01:29:27,679
Section 28-J,...

1503
01:29:27,773 --> 01:29:29,647
..code of millitary justice.

1504
01:29:29,734 --> 01:29:31,015
Mutiny,...

1505
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:34,147
..an offence punishable by death.

1506
01:29:38,452 --> 01:29:40,161
Jesus, Monfriez.

1507
01:29:40,496 --> 01:29:43,249
Shut up! She's trying to get us killed!

1508
01:29:45,085 --> 01:29:46,544
Ilario, who you with?

1509
01:29:51,176 --> 01:29:54,592
Come on, Ilario, shithead,
do you want to die?

1510
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,935
Please, Captain.

1511
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:05,307
Oh!

1512
01:30:08,946 --> 01:30:10,275
Unh.

1513
01:30:16,414 --> 01:30:17,694
They're going away.

1514
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:19,249
It was just a probe.

1515
01:30:19,375 --> 01:30:20,289
Oh.

1516
01:30:20,377 --> 01:30:22,120
Shit.

1517
01:30:22,212 --> 01:30:24,335
Are you all right?

1518
01:30:24,465 --> 01:30:25,164
Shit!

1519
01:30:25,257 --> 01:30:27,749
Oh, my God.

1520
01:30:27,844 --> 01:30:29,124
Oh, my God.

1521
01:30:29,304 --> 01:30:30,169
Shit.

1522
01:30:30,263 --> 01:30:32,933
I don't fucking believe it.

1523
01:30:35,227 --> 01:30:36,888
Give me your weapon.

1524
01:30:37,063 --> 01:30:39,471
Christ, I thought you were firing at me!

1525
01:30:53,916 --> 01:30:56,288
You're wounded, ma'am. Let me see.

1526
01:30:59,673 --> 01:31:00,918
You're with him.

1527
01:31:01,008 --> 01:31:03,416
You got to let me look at it.

1528
01:31:05,012 --> 01:31:07,136
Christ, let him look at it!

1529
01:31:07,223 --> 01:31:09,797
I gave birth to a nine-pound baby,...

1530
01:31:09,893 --> 01:31:11,174
..asshole!

1531
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:13,144
I think I can handle it!

1532
01:31:17,777 --> 01:31:20,269
Cap, we got to get you out of here.

1533
01:31:21,323 --> 01:31:23,316
We stay with Rady.

1534
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:27,162
- And then?
- And then...

1535
01:31:45,226 --> 01:31:47,385
Incoming!

1536
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,391
150 metres and closing!

1537
01:31:52,234 --> 01:31:54,441
140!

1538
01:31:55,947 --> 01:31:57,655
130!

1539
01:31:57,949 --> 01:31:59,492
Give me my weapon!

1540
01:31:59,576 --> 01:32:01,201
Ilario, how's Rady?

1541
01:32:01,286 --> 01:32:03,279
- He's dead!
- No, he's alive!

1542
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:06,248
Come on, Captain, give him his weapon!

1543
01:32:06,334 --> 01:32:09,252
- This is insane! Give me my weapon!
- Shut up!

1544
01:32:09,338 --> 01:32:11,212
90 metres and closing!

1545
01:32:11,298 --> 01:32:12,841
80!

1546
01:32:15,345 --> 01:32:16,673
I'm sorry.

1547
01:32:21,185 --> 01:32:22,264
OK. OK.

1548
01:32:22,353 --> 01:32:24,476
OK, we’ll get you out of here, Captain.

1549
01:32:24,564 --> 01:32:26,058
It's all over.

1550
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:28,267
No, Monfriez,...

1551
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,269
..it's not over.

1552
01:32:30,362 --> 01:32:31,857
There will be a reckoning.

1553
01:32:31,947 --> 01:32:33,490
Count on it.

1554
01:32:37,162 --> 01:32:39,285
Hey, what's that?

1555
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,084
There's the rescue!

1556
01:33:00,147 --> 01:33:01,310
Let's move it! Move it!

1557
01:33:01,399 --> 01:33:02,810
Move it! Move it!

1558
01:33:03,067 --> 01:33:04,182
No!

1559
01:33:04,277 --> 01:33:05,937
Wait.

1560
01:33:06,029 --> 01:33:08,355
Help Rady.

1561
01:33:09,408 --> 01:33:12,326
We're pinned down here!

1562
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:28,177
Ilario, give me the M-16.

1563
01:33:28,389 --> 01:33:31,390
Give me the goddamn M-16!

1564
01:33:48,621 --> 01:33:49,949
I’ll cover you.

1565
01:33:51,541 --> 01:33:52,537
Go!

1566
01:33:54,127 --> 01:33:55,158
I’ll cover you!

1567
01:33:55,253 --> 01:33:56,249
Negative, ma'am!

1568
01:33:56,338 --> 01:33:59,957
Come back for me
with a stretcher and more guns!

1569
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:02,838
- Karen, please!
- Go! It's an order!

1570
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:03,546
Karen, please!

1571
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:05,465
Go! Go!

1572
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:36,676
Wait!

1573
01:34:39,847 --> 01:34:41,258
Wait!

1574
01:34:46,021 --> 01:34:47,432
Where's Walden?

1575
01:34:47,773 --> 01:34:51,522
She's dead!

1576
01:35:02,165 --> 01:35:05,120
No!

1577
01:36:09,995 --> 01:36:12,996
Monfriez said she would
have court-martial led us.

1578
01:36:15,209 --> 01:36:18,211
Altameyer was too fucked up to say anything.

1579
01:36:21,633 --> 01:36:22,748
She was...

1580
01:36:22,843 --> 01:36:25,132
She was probably killed by small arms...

1581
01:36:25,221 --> 01:36:27,629
..before the napalm ever hit.

1582
01:36:29,601 --> 01:36:30,930
Either way,...

1583
01:36:31,019 --> 01:36:34,104
..she never could have
survived that stomach wound.

1584
01:36:35,233 --> 01:36:37,226
You think that matters?

1585
01:36:44,243 --> 01:36:45,786
No.

1586
01:36:48,373 --> 01:36:49,536
No.

1587
01:36:49,624 --> 01:36:51,249
Hmm.

1588
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:12,181
I couldn't bear to send this.

1589
01:37:12,276 --> 01:37:14,565
Uh, I didn't even want to...

1590
01:37:14,654 --> 01:37:17,192
I didn't even want to touch it.

1591
01:37:17,282 --> 01:37:18,693
Uh...

1592
01:37:33,676 --> 01:37:36,298
Can you get it to her parents for me?

1593
01:37:39,308 --> 01:37:40,802
Can you...?

1594
01:37:40,893 --> 01:37:42,056
Please?

1595
01:37:44,063 --> 01:37:45,439
Yeah.

1596
01:37:59,748 --> 01:38:02,619
Uh, listen,
I'm going to have to call you back.

1597
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:04,668
You got off the phone for me?

1598
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:07,424
- You’ll want me there for this.
- Meaning?

1599
01:38:07,507 --> 01:38:11,672
Remember that stereo you told me not to buy
cos who needs a dual cassette deck?

1600
01:38:11,762 --> 01:38:15,214
When does anyone ever have
a reason to copy a tape?

1601
01:38:15,308 --> 01:38:17,681
Nat, just the man I wanted to see.

1602
01:38:17,769 --> 01:38:20,225
Uh, do you know Colonel Serling?

1603
01:38:20,314 --> 01:38:22,936
This is Tony Gartner
of the Washington Post.

1604
01:38:23,026 --> 01:38:24,603
He was with the 9th in Vietnam.

1605
01:38:24,694 --> 01:38:25,608
Mr. Gartner.

1606
01:38:25,695 --> 01:38:26,858
Colonel.

1607
01:38:26,947 --> 01:38:28,441
Take a seat, Nat.

1608
01:38:28,532 --> 01:38:31,652
He's following up
our investigation of Al Bathra,...

1609
01:38:31,744 --> 01:38:36,454
..and it seems that he has a few questions
that he'd like to ask us.

1610
01:38:36,541 --> 01:38:38,534
Let's give him every facility.

1611
01:38:38,627 --> 01:38:41,498
- I appreciate that.
- Some ground rules, though.

1612
01:38:41,589 --> 01:38:44,959
I insist we be allowed to schedule
the release of all information...

1613
01:38:45,051 --> 01:38:47,340
..to the public regarding casualties.

1614
01:38:47,429 --> 01:38:50,300
Well, I wish I could accommodate you, sir,...

1615
01:38:50,391 --> 01:38:56,893
..but, unfortunately, we’ll be going with
a story based on a tape that I've acquired...

1616
01:38:56,982 --> 01:39:00,482
..of all radio communications that night.

1617
01:39:02,405 --> 01:39:04,398
So,...

1618
01:39:04,616 --> 01:39:06,408
..I'd like you to listen...

1619
01:39:06,493 --> 01:39:08,403
..and then comment for the record.

1620
01:39:08,495 --> 01:39:10,405
I can't comment for the record.

1621
01:39:10,498 --> 01:39:12,574
This is an ongoing investigation.

1622
01:39:14,419 --> 01:39:16,911
First right! Turn to the right!

1623
01:39:17,005 --> 01:39:18,168
Sabre-6, this is Bobcat-5.

1624
01:39:18,257 --> 01:39:21,461
Enemy tangos!
Say again! Enemy tanks in our lines. Over.

1625
01:39:21,552 --> 01:39:24,756
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.
Enemy tangos at phase line delta...

1626
01:39:24,848 --> 01:39:28,264
- I don't think any more of this...
- This is what happened, General.

1627
01:39:28,352 --> 01:39:31,354
Liberty-6, this is Sabre-6.
Enemy tanks on our flank. Out!

1628
01:39:31,439 --> 01:39:33,183
Patella, find me a target.

1629
01:39:33,275 --> 01:39:36,774
- l think l got one, sir.
- Do you or do you not have a target?

1630
01:39:36,862 --> 01:39:38,772
It must be, sir. They’re firing at us.

1631
01:39:38,864 --> 01:39:39,813
Loader!

1632
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:40,856
Up, sir!

1633
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:41,899
Fire!

1634
01:39:41,993 --> 01:39:43,191
On the way!

1635
01:39:43,286 --> 01:39:45,078
- Target! We got that sucker!
- Yeah!

1636
01:39:45,163 --> 01:39:48,699
Sabre-6, we just lost Cougar-6.
Repeat, we just lost Boylar.

1637
01:39:48,793 --> 01:39:50,371
Roger that, sir. We got him.

1638
01:39:50,461 --> 01:39:53,332
- You just lit up a friendly.
- Roger that. We... What?

1639
01:39:53,423 --> 01:39:57,007
You just lit up a friendly, goddamn it!

1640
01:39:57,094 --> 01:40:01,591
Cougar-6 was one of your own Abrams,
Colonel Serling. Is that correct?

1641
01:40:03,935 --> 01:40:05,134
Yes, that's correct.

1642
01:40:07,606 --> 01:40:11,106
Sabre-6, Nat, what’s happening?
Sabre-6, report.

1643
01:40:11,277 --> 01:40:13,187
Patella, was that one of our tanks?

1644
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:13,944
They fired.

1645
01:40:14,031 --> 01:40:16,024
At us or at the T-72s?

1646
01:40:16,116 --> 01:40:17,112
l don',t know.

1647
01:40:17,201 --> 01:40:20,072
- At us or at the T-72s, Patella?
- l don’,t know!

1648
01:40:20,163 --> 01:40:23,164
Colonel Serling, report status now.

1649
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,661
They have range on us!

1650
01:40:24,752 --> 01:40:28,002
All Sabre elements,
stop all tanks, turn on your lights.

1651
01:40:28,089 --> 01:40:30,378
I say again,
stop all tanks and turn on your Lights.

1652
01:40:30,467 --> 01:40:32,839
Sabre-6, Nat, what’s happening out there?

1653
01:40:34,972 --> 01:40:36,135
Load us up.

1654
01:40:36,599 --> 01:40:39,968
Patella, find me a target.
Snap out of it. Find me a target.

1655
01:40:40,061 --> 01:40:41,224
Patella, come on!

1656
01:40:43,607 --> 01:40:45,232
- Target!
- We're up.

1657
01:40:45,317 --> 01:40:47,606
- Lights on or off?
- Off.

1658
01:40:49,489 --> 01:40:50,900
- Fire!
- On the way.

1659
01:40:54,828 --> 01:40:55,860
- Sir?
- Fire!

1660
01:41:02,129 --> 01:41:04,454
Colonel Serling, report status now!

1661
01:41:04,548 --> 01:41:07,965
Sabre-6, situation under control, General.

1662
01:41:09,929 --> 01:41:14,841
General, Colonel Serling's order
to activate Lights,...

1663
01:41:14,935 --> 01:41:18,601
..was that a standard response
to enemy infiltration of the lines?

1664
01:41:19,941 --> 01:41:22,018
At the critical moment,...

1665
01:41:22,110 --> 01:41:24,649
..in spite of terrible losses,...

1666
01:41:24,739 --> 01:41:27,859
..Colonel Serling didn't hesitate to act.

1667
01:41:27,951 --> 01:41:30,620
Ordering those tanks
to turn on their Lights...

1668
01:41:30,704 --> 01:41:33,955
..saved the lives
of God knows how many of our men.

1669
01:41:34,041 --> 01:41:36,248
Heroic acts arise...

1670
01:41:36,335 --> 01:41:38,494
..out of desperate circumstances.

1671
01:41:38,588 --> 01:41:43,630
I have no trouble at all
believing that Colonel Serling is a hero.

1672
01:41:43,719 --> 01:41:45,795
Like Captain Karen Walden.

1673
01:41:45,888 --> 01:41:49,472
Did you know, Mr. Gartner, for the first time
a woman is being considered...

1674
01:41:49,559 --> 01:41:52,015
..for the Medal of Honour
for her performance under fire?

1675
01:41:52,104 --> 01:41:53,931
And, um,...

1676
01:41:54,023 --> 01:41:56,265
..Colonel Serling...

1677
01:41:56,359 --> 01:41:59,360
..is just finishing up the inquiry.

1678
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:01,355
How's that going, Nat?

1679
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:10,248
I think, uh,...

1680
01:42:13,629 --> 01:42:18,506
..in order to honour
a soldier like Karen Walden,...

1681
01:42:18,593 --> 01:42:21,714
..we have to tell the truth, General,...

1682
01:42:21,805 --> 01:42:24,048
..about what happened over there.

1683
01:42:26,644 --> 01:42:30,096
The whole, hard,...

1684
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:32,942
..cold truth.

1685
01:42:33,027 --> 01:42:36,527
And until we do that, uh,...

1686
01:42:36,614 --> 01:42:39,782
..we dishonor her...

1687
01:42:39,868 --> 01:42:42,194
..and every soldier who died,...

1688
01:42:42,288 --> 01:42:45,040
..who gave their life for their country.

1689
01:43:07,234 --> 01:43:09,559
My full report, General.

1690
01:43:14,784 --> 01:43:18,201
Few of us are given the opportunity,...

1691
01:43:18,288 --> 01:43:20,994
..even fewer the courage,...

1692
01:43:21,083 --> 01:43:26,624
..to sacrifice ourselves
for the lives of our comrades.

1693
01:43:26,715 --> 01:43:29,716
In daily life, even as in battle,...

1694
01:43:29,802 --> 01:43:35,426
..each one of us is mysteriously
and irrevocably bound to our fellow man.

1695
01:43:35,934 --> 01:43:37,097
And yet,...

1696
01:43:37,811 --> 01:43:41,263
..it is only in death
that the power of this bond...

1697
01:43:41,524 --> 01:43:44,229
..is finally tested and proven.

1698
01:43:45,737 --> 01:43:48,608
And who among us really knows...

1699
01:43:48,699 --> 01:43:52,033
..how he might respond
when that moment comes?

1700
01:44:24,199 --> 01:44:27,319
I guess we've been expecting you.

1701
01:44:27,411 --> 01:44:31,361
Ahem. First of all, let me, um...

1702
01:44:31,457 --> 01:44:33,830
Let me just say that, uh,...

1703
01:44:33,919 --> 01:44:35,995
..there was nothing that, uh,...

1704
01:44:38,174 --> 01:44:40,630
..Tom and I wouldn't do for each other.

1705
01:44:40,927 --> 01:44:42,635
Nothing.

1706
01:44:42,929 --> 01:44:45,717
He was a good soldier.

1707
01:44:45,807 --> 01:44:48,299
He was like a brother to me.

1708
01:44:49,812 --> 01:44:53,182
That night, uh, 25 February...

1709
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,899
..there were enemy tanks in our lines.

1710
01:45:01,242 --> 01:45:03,235
We thought...

1711
01:45:06,624 --> 01:45:09,744
I... I thought that, uh,...

1712
01:45:09,836 --> 01:45:13,336
..Tom's tank was an enemy tank.

1713
01:45:16,886 --> 01:45:18,510
And, uh,...

1714
01:45:25,437 --> 01:45:27,893
..I gave the order to fire.

1715
01:45:32,445 --> 01:45:34,154
God help me.

1716
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:35,817
I, um...

1717
01:45:38,244 --> 01:45:40,570
Yeah, I killed him.

1718
01:45:46,253 --> 01:45:48,330
As for the funeral,...

1719
01:45:50,258 --> 01:45:52,500
..the lies the Army told...

1720
01:45:54,847 --> 01:45:58,097
..and the lies that I told...

1721
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:02,892
..to you, I can only...

1722
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,853
..beg for your forgiveness.

1723
01:46:13,869 --> 01:46:15,945
As far as the...

1724
01:46:18,291 --> 01:46:20,414
As far as that night, um,...

1725
01:46:22,921 --> 01:46:24,795
..I guess there's no way that, uh,...

1726
01:46:24,882 --> 01:46:27,290
..I can even begin to ask you to forgive me.

1727
01:46:29,304 --> 01:46:31,926
I know that,...

1728
01:46:32,182 --> 01:46:36,430
..but it's a burden
you're going to have to put down sometime.

1729
01:46:36,896 --> 01:46:38,521
Thank you, sir.

1730
01:47:06,931 --> 01:47:08,307
Mr. President.

1731
01:47:39,261 --> 01:47:40,921
Dear Mom and Dad,...

1732
01:47:41,013 --> 01:47:44,465
..well, this is it - the big push.

1733
01:47:44,559 --> 01:47:47,596
Looks like it's gonna really happen.

1734
01:47:47,687 --> 01:47:49,348
And I'm afraid,...

1735
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:51,313
..not of being hurt or killed,...

1736
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:54,900
..well, kind of, but not much.

1737
01:47:54,988 --> 01:47:58,938
My only regret will be
to never see you two again...

1738
01:47:59,034 --> 01:48:01,360
..and that I’ll never see Anne Marie grow up.

1739
01:48:01,453 --> 01:48:04,870
But I know she's in good hands, the best.

1740
01:48:04,958 --> 01:48:10,000
What I'm really afraid of is that
I might let my people down, my crew.

1741
01:48:10,089 --> 01:48:14,253
These people depend on me.
They put their lives in my hands.

1742
01:48:14,344 --> 01:48:17,049
I just can't fall 'em.

1743
01:48:47,466 --> 01:48:49,423
Now, I know if you get this letter...

1744
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:51,004
..it means I'm dead.

1745
01:48:51,095 --> 01:48:53,384
I only hope that I've made you proud,...

1746
01:48:53,473 --> 01:48:55,430
..that I did my job,...

1747
01:48:55,517 --> 01:48:57,391
..and I didn't let down my country,...

1748
01:48:57,477 --> 01:49:00,395
..my crew, my fellow soldiers.

1749
01:49:00,481 --> 01:49:02,390
I Love you guys.

1750
01:49:02,483 --> 01:49:06,398
Never stop telling Anne Marie
how much I Love her.

1751
01:49:06,488 --> 01:49:09,489
Your daughter, Karen.

1752
01:49:37,691 --> 01:49:39,601
You got it? All right.
