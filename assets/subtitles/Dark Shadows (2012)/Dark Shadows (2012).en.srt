Yours says:

1397
01:51:29,205 --> 01:51:30,558
"I have secrets."

1398
01:51:30,765 --> 01:51:33,040
BURTON: Bella looks like a person
who's been reincarnated.

1399
01:51:33,245 --> 01:51:36,954
That's why she was just the right person
for Victoria.

1400
01:51:37,165 --> 01:51:40,123
It's really fun.
I've been fortunate enough...

1401
01:51:40,325 --> 01:51:42,236
...I haven't shot Josette and Vicky
on the same day.

1402
01:51:42,445 --> 01:51:44,675
But it's kind of great,
because the look is so different.

1403
01:51:44,885 --> 01:51:48,082
It makes it a lot easier to play
the two separate characters.

1404
01:51:48,285 --> 01:51:49,513
I was gonna scare you.

1405
01:51:49,725 --> 01:51:50,714
Were you scared?

1406
01:51:50,925 --> 01:51:52,358
Terrified beyond belief.

1407
01:51:55,285 --> 01:51:56,479
BARNABAS:
How long has it been?

1408
01:51:56,685 --> 01:51:58,243
It's been 20 minutes.

1409
01:52:00,845 --> 01:52:03,962
Vicky relates to David
because we're both haunted.

1410
01:52:04,165 --> 01:52:05,564
BURTON:
The best way to describe it...

1411
01:52:05,765 --> 01:52:08,074
...is Gully looks like a kid
who looks like he sees ghosts.

1412
01:52:08,285 --> 01:52:11,004
MILLER: Tore us to pieces in one scene
that he turned it on like that...

1413
01:52:11,165 --> 01:52:12,234
...and I got really jealous.

1414
01:52:12,405 --> 01:52:13,394
[LAUGHS]

1415
01:52:13,565 --> 01:52:17,638
This is the best first film I could've been in.
Everybody's really friendly...

1416
01:52:17,845 --> 01:52:19,278
...and extremely witty and funny.

1417
01:52:19,485 --> 01:52:21,680
What have I told you
about cutting holes in the sheets?

1418
01:52:22,405 --> 01:52:23,758
Those are Egyptian cotton.

1419
01:52:27,325 --> 01:52:30,397
Exactly what I've been saying.
This family could use some balls.

1420
01:52:33,125 --> 01:52:35,195
BURTON: Jonny Lee Miller
looked like the original Roger.

1421
01:52:35,405 --> 01:52:38,442
Not even knowing. I don't think he knew
the series at all or anything like that.

1422
01:52:38,645 --> 01:52:40,363
He's, like, one of my favorites in it.

1423
01:52:40,565 --> 01:52:42,715
MILLER: It's nice to play someone
that is not very nice...

1424
01:52:42,925 --> 01:52:45,519
...and a bit of an idiot,
I would go as far as to say.

1425
01:52:45,725 --> 01:52:48,922
Because I'm not an idiot at all,
so it's nice to get to play one.

1426
01:52:49,765 --> 01:52:50,754
[LAUGHS]

1427
01:52:50,965 --> 01:52:53,081
Chop-chop, Willie, I'm starving.

1428
01:52:54,045 --> 01:52:56,559
And God help me
if it's another bone-dry pot roast...

1429
01:52:59,365 --> 01:53:00,798
[SNORING]

1430
01:53:01,005 --> 01:53:02,358
Awaken.

1431
01:53:05,445 --> 01:53:09,120
HALEY: Willie's kind of somewhat
of a disheveled, sloppy kind of guy.

1432
01:53:09,325 --> 01:53:12,476
In this version,
he's the servant to the family.

1433
01:53:12,685 --> 01:53:16,803
He's quite different than the Willie Loomis
from the soap opera.

1434
01:53:17,005 --> 01:53:20,042
BURTON: Many years ago, Jackie sent me
an audition that he did on his own...

1435
01:53:20,245 --> 01:53:22,201
...and I was sort of blown away by it.

1436
01:53:22,405 --> 01:53:25,363
[SINGING]
<i>I'll keep on drinking and trust my...</i>

1437
01:53:25,565 --> 01:53:27,237
HALEY:
He's a different character for me.

1438
01:53:27,445 --> 01:53:30,676
I definitely looked at a lot of drunk people
on the Internet. That was very helpful.

1439
01:53:33,485 --> 01:53:35,282
He's a murderer.

1440
01:53:38,325 --> 01:53:41,158
McGRATH:
Dr. Hoffman is David's psychiatrist.

1441
01:53:41,365 --> 01:53:44,516
She was only supposed to be there
for two weeks when David was 5 or 6...

1442
01:53:44,725 --> 01:53:46,477
...and she's been there ever since.

1443
01:53:46,685 --> 01:53:48,755
She's overstayed her welcome.

1444
01:53:48,965 --> 01:53:50,000
You're the doctor.

1445
01:53:50,525 --> 01:53:53,323
Yeah. And you're "the nanny,"
and she's "the bitch."

1446
01:53:54,605 --> 01:53:56,914
DEPP: We've done about 15,000
films together, Helena and I.

1447
01:53:57,125 --> 01:53:59,355
Without even saying anything
or trying anything...

1448
01:53:59,565 --> 01:54:01,556
...we almost, like,
try to out-weird each other.

1449
01:54:01,765 --> 01:54:03,756
BURTON:
I don't know how flattered Helena was...

1450
01:54:03,965 --> 01:54:06,684
...to be offered the role
of an aging alcoholic psychiatrist...

1451
01:54:06,885 --> 01:54:08,921
...but somebody's gotta do it, right?

1452
01:54:09,365 --> 01:54:13,722
He saw me as the alcoholic psychiatrist
as if it was really, really obvious.

1453
01:54:13,925 --> 01:54:15,040
[LAUGHING]

1454
01:54:15,245 --> 01:54:17,554
DEPP: I don't know how many times
I've killed Helena on films.

1455
01:54:17,765 --> 01:54:20,199
Tim constantly has me killing his wife
in his movies.

1456
01:54:20,605 --> 01:54:21,924
I don't know what that means.

1457
01:54:25,085 --> 01:54:28,475
I know that Tim is so thrilled
about the cast and everybody in it.

1458
01:54:28,965 --> 01:54:32,435
I think it's probably the most fun
I've seen Tim have on a set.

1459
01:54:32,645 --> 01:54:35,637
Tim actually would sometimes laugh
off camera in the middle of a take.

1460
01:54:36,085 --> 01:54:37,438
It won't happen again.

1461
01:54:37,645 --> 01:54:41,001
Because everybody was so funny
and so weird.

1462
01:54:41,205 --> 01:54:44,117
BURTON: Luckily, at the end of it all,
everybody that was in it...

1463
01:54:44,325 --> 01:54:49,240
...for me, was like a <i>Dark Shadows</i> person
whether they like it or not.

1464
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
DEEPSEA

1465
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,111
