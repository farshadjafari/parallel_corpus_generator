our trespasses,

And lead us
not into temptation,

[Man's Voice]
When I raise my flashing sword...

15
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,836
and my hand
takes hold on judgment,

16
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,715
I will take vengeance
upon mine enemies.

17
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,683
And I will repay those
who haze me.

18
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,148
O Lord, raise me
to Thy right hand...

19
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,557
and count me
among Thy saints.

20
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,963
And I am reminded
on this holy day...

21
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:48,337
of the sad story
of Kitty Genovese.

22
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,980
As you all may remember,

23
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,108
a long time ago,
almost 30 years ago,

24
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:02,348
this poor soul
cried out for help...

25
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,982
time and time again,

26
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,960
but no person
answered her calls.

27
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,960
Though many saw,

28
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,967
no one so much
as called the police.

29
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:21,935
They all just watched as Kitty
was being stabbed to death...

30
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,575
in broad daylight.

31
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:30,275
They watched as
her assailant walked away.

32
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:36,982
Now, we must all fear
evil men.

33
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,190
But there is
another kind of evil...

34
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,924
which we must fear most,

35
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,797
and that is
the indifference...

37
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:17,021

- Basically, the rule of thumb here is...
- Wait. Rule of thumb?

46
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,190
In the early 1900s, it was legal
for men to beat their wives...

47
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,523
as long as they used a stick
no wider than their thumb.

48
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,069
Can't do much damage
with that then, can we?

the "rule of wrist."

would give me problems.

- Fourth floor, huh?

169
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,948
Mm-hmm.

Then we're headin'
to the fifth.

171
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,245
Come on. Let's get out of here.
You're reachin', man.

172
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,813
- It's a theory.
- I don't know. No way.

173
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,792
You know how big a guy's
gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge.

174
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:33,127
Oh, really? I might just be
wantin' a bagel with my coffee.

175

no fuckin' bagel.

Listen, I know this neighborhood
pretty good.

179
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,928

named McGinty's.

180
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,658

they were there last night.
- Good work, Mitchell.

That's what he said.

195

- How the fuck's he know that?
We haven't spoken to anyone.
- D-D-Don't know.

196
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,503
He d-d-didn't say.

197
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,138
All right. Listen, Doc,
we need you to do us a favor.

198

was directed at you.

whichever one of you...

That's just
what we need now...

207
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,371
some sensational story
in the papers...

208
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:34,408
making these boys out to be
superheroes triumphing over evil.

209
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,353
Let me squash
the rumors now.

210
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,051
These two are not heroes.

211
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,126
They're just
two ordinary men...

212
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,927
who were put in
an extraordinary situation,

213
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,366
and they just happened
to come out on top.

214
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,395
Yes, nothing from our
far-reaching computer system...

215

has turned up diddly
on these two.

216
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,875
All we know is what
we found out from the neighbors.

217
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,878
And the general consensus is,

218
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,549
they're angels.

219
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,084
But angels don't kill.

220
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,818
And we got
two bodies in the morgue...

221

serial-crushed...

Are we considering these guys
armed and dangerous?

224
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,136
Well, not armed.

225
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,765
If they had guns,
they would've used them.
But dangerous? Very.

226
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,775
Now, what makes you think
they're dangerous?

227
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,311
- Maybe they're just
protectin' each other.

one way or the other.

Just be careful and go
by the protocol on this.

230
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:49,124
It's grunt police work
that's gonna bring this one in.

231

miles away by now.

But if you wanna beat your head
against the wall, then
here's what you're lookin'for.

Anything in a uniform
or flashing blue lights
is gonna spook 'em.

235

Okay? So the only thing we can do
is put a potato on a string...

236

and drag it through
South Boston.

better luck with a beer.

from before, huh?

We met them last night.

251
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,011
They had some
pretty interesting bandages.

252

253
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,087
Listen, if you want to fight,
you can see you're outnumbered here.

254
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,124
We're trying to be civil,
so I suggest you take our offer.

Let me explain it to you.

477
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,142
In Greek and Roman mythology,

to pay the toll to Charon,

479

across to the Gates of Judgment.

They're almost identical.

The two bullets went in here
through the top of the skull,

crisscrossed, and exited
through the eyeballs.

489
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:18,353
This one clue tells us
three distinct facts.

- Number one. Duffy?
- They shot him at a downward angle.

- Excellent. Number two. Greenly.

They shot him
at a downward angle?

It tells us
he was the last to die.

And number three.

to make two such
identical wounds?

- Ah, possible.

502
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,159
But unlikely.
The angles are too extreme.

00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,635
A guy holding two guns
to the back of your noodle is
going to shoot straight ahead.

504
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,638
He wouldn't cock out his elbows.
It makes no sense.

505
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:13,006
Besides, are you telling me
one guy came in here...

506
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,036
and killed eight men with eight
extremely well-aimed shots
in just a few seconds?

507
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,708
No way.
It had to be at least two.

508
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,489
[Scoffs]
You and your fuckin' rope.

509
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:41,671
- I told you there would be a shaft.
- Just like on television.

511
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,430

Where the fuck
are you goin'?

514
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,625
Shh! I fuckin' hear
some shit out here.

515
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:43,565
Fuck you.
I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin'
your fuckin' rope around.

516
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,829
- It must weigh 30 pounds.
- Shh!

517
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,804
We are doin' some serious
shit here. Now, get
a fuckin' hold of yourself!

518
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:52,104
Oh, fuck you!
I'm not the rope-totin'
Charlie Bronson wannabe...

519
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:56,169
- that's gettin' us fuckin' lost.
- Would you fuckin' shut it!

520
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,415
You mother...

[Together]
Shepherds we shall be
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

524
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,579
Power hath descended forth
from Thy hand.

525
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:40,123
Our feet may swiftly
carry out Thy command.

526
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,990
So we shall flow a river forth
to Thee, and teeming
with souls shall it ever be.

00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,580
Television.

532
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,813
Television is
the explanation for this.

533
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:45,685
You see this in bad television.

534
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:49,192
The little assault guys
creepin' through the vents,
comin' in through the ceiling.

535
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,127
That James Bond shit
never happens in real life.
Professionals don't do that.

536
00:43:55,065 --> 00:44:00,367
Well, name one thing
you're gonna need
this stupid fuckin' rope for.

537
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,338
- That was way easier than I thought.
- Aye.

538
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,932
On TV,
you've always got that guy
that jumps over the sofa.

539
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,309
- And then you've gotta shoot him
for ten fuckin' minutes too.
- Aye.

540

- We're good.
- Yes, we are.

541
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,312

is in that little case there?

542
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:26,855
- Fuck me!
- Oh.

543
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,023

Please, don't shoot.

Jeez!

00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,731

Fuck this fuckin'...
How did you two
fuckin'fucks... Fuck!

575
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:37,961
Well, that certainly illustrates
the diversity of the word.

576
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,499
All these guys
are Russian mob.

577
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,538
But not like those two peons
in the alley the other day.

578
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,540
These guys are all syndicate
bosses and underbosses.

579
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:53,803
I have a dossier
on every man in this room.

580
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:58,847
Since the Iron Curtain
has gone down,

581
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,646
the Russian syndicates
have started to come here.

582
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:05,950
And in the spirit of Glasnost,
the Soviets have opened
their borders to the Mafia.

583
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:09,015
But the Italians,
they aren't convinced...

584
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:12,425
the grounds in Mother Russia
are fertile enough
for organized crime yet.

585
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:17,866
So they ain't ready to commit.
But the Russians
are coming here anyway.

586
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,460
They are unwelcome.

587
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:24,337
So, what we have here,
gentlemen,

588
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:27,241
is possibly the beginning...

589
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,745
of the first
international mob war.

590
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:34,208
Unless I've
totally missed something.

591
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,718
I'm live from
the Copley Plaza Hotel,

592
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,347
where we have just been informed
that the largest multiple murder...

593
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,755
in Boston's history
has just taken place.

594
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,952
We have learned that
there were nine victims,

595
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,428
all deeply involved in a notoriously
violent Russian crime syndicate,

596
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,431
right here in Boston.

597
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:52,127
Anybody you think is evil?

598
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,432
Aye.

599
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:58,099
Don't you think
that's a little weird, a little psycho?

600
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,803
Do you know what I think
is psycho, Roc?

601
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,609
It's decent men
with loving families.

602
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:09,584
They go home
every day after work,
and they turn on the news.

603
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,281
You know what they see?
They see rapists...

604
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,483
and murderers
and child molesters.

605
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,492
They're all gettin'
out of prison.

606
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,552
Mafiosos...

607
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,825
gettin' caught
with 20 kilos...

608
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,959
gettin' out on bail
the same fuckin' day.

609
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,630
And everywhere,
everyone thinks the same thing...

610
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:31,765
that someone should just
go kill those motherfuckers.

611
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:36,573
Kill 'em all.
Admit it.

612
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,911
Even you've thought about it.

613
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,481
You guys should be
in every major city.

614
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,982
This is some heavy shit.

615
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,992
This is like
"Lone Ranger" heavy, man.

616
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,888
Fuck it!
There's so much shit
that pisses me off!

617
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,468
You guys should recruit, 'cause
I'm sick and fuckin' tired...

618
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,870
of walkin' down the street
waitin' for one of these crack-pipin',

619
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,342

lowlifes to get me!

620
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,641
Hallelujah, Jaffar.

621
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,647
So you're not just talkin'
about mob guys, right?

622
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,377
You're talkin' about pimps
and drug dealers
and all that shit, right?

623
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,214
Oh, yeah.

624
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:21,520
Fuck. You guys could
do this every goddamn day.

625
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,321
We're sort of like 7-Eleven.

626
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:27,886
We're not always doin' business,
but we're always open.

627
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:32,061
- Mmm. That is nicely put.
- Thank you very much.

628
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,572
I will fuck you up, dude.

629
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,717
So then we go right through
the fuckin' ceiling like this...
[Continues, Indistinct]

630
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:07,402
Oh, boy.
You fuckin' guys.
You ruined me.

631
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:10,133
I'm fuckin' done.

632
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,335
Permanent fuckin' package boy.

633
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:17,437
Who said that?
You can take credit
on that, you know?

634
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,846
What, are you serious?

635
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,850
Yeah. Fuck it.

636
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,250
If you think about it,
it's all you can do, really.

637
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,382
I mean,
you can't go in there
and tell him it was us.

638
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,449
[Connor]
Climb the corporate
ladder, boy.

640
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,861
Fuck it.

641
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,866
I'm doin' it.
I deserve it.

642
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:40,960
I've been workin'
for those fat bastards
since I've been in high school.

643
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,132
Look at this fuckin' place.
They're fuckin' me, man.

644
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:48,405
They can suck
my pathetic little dick!

645
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,003
And I'll dip my nuts
in marinara sauce...

646
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,777
just so the fat bastards
can get a taste of home
while they're at it.

647
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:57,251
Fuck it!
I'm doin'it.

648
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,050
It is done!
Shit!

649
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:03,422
- Shit! Shit!
- Oh, my God!

650
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:08,655
- What the fuck!
- I'm hit!

651
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,666
Oh, fuck!

652
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,998
[Rocco]
What the fuck!

653
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:18,466
I can't believe
that just fuckin' happened!

654
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,772
- Is it dead?
- Oh, my God!

655
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,425
Donna's gonna be angry
about her cat.

656
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:48,062
Shit.

657
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:50,538
She's on every drug
known to man.

658
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:54,008
She'd have sold the thing
for a dime bag. Screw her.

659
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:57,069
[Laughing]

660
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,547
I do kind of feel
like an asshole, though.

661
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,982
Yeah, Roc, you sound
real remorseful there.

662
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,145
She ain't been around
in weeks anyhow.

663
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,056
Listen, something's been
botherin' me about last night.

664
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,959
What?

665
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,895
What if your boss knew
how many fellows
were supposed to be there?

666
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,025
- What are you...
What are you sayin'?
- Think about it.

667
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,399
Nine men, six bullets.

668
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,667
Think they sold me out?
No way. No way.

669
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,106
Listen, he probably knew
you'd end up nailin' the fat guy,

670
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,201
maybe one or two more,
but he had to know you
weren't walkin' out of there.

671
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,712
Figure it out.
The shooter's dead at the scene.

672
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,714
There's no
in-depth investigation.

673
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:35,182
They'll just slide right off
his fuckin' back.

674
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,186
'Cause what the fuck?

675
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,655
As much as I love you, man,
you are not exactly Don Corleone.

676
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,658
No, no, that...

677
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,921
That's just not the way
things are done.
Besides, how does he know...

678
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,987
I just don't get in there,
see there's too many of'em,
serve 'em their fuckin' food...

679
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,055
Because he fuckin'
knows you, Roc!

680
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:53,534
A smooth hitter would have
gone in there, seen it was
a fuckin' wash and slipped out.

681
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,764
But you, he knows
this is your only shot.

682
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,171
You've been waitin'
18 fuckin' years.

683
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,441
No. No, no.
That-That...

684
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,537
That just ain't the way...
No, that's bull... That's bullshit.

685
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:07,674
You don't know what
you're talkin' about. That's
just not the way things happen.

686
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,879
I mean, thanks for your concern and all,
but that just ain't the thing of it.

687
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,388
Do me a favor, all right?
Just roll it around a bit
on your way in.

688
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:15,390
- Will you for me?
- No. No rollin'.

689
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,859
Nothin' needs to be rolled.
Fuck!

690
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,625
- Where the fuck are you goin'?
Did you tell him?
- Of course I fuckin' told him.

- You guys don't know
that shit for sure!

Oh, you're such
a fuckin' retard!

693

- Hey, fuck you!
- Oh, man, use your
fuckin' brain for once!

694
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:33,905
Is it so unbelievable that
they don't fuckin' care about ya?

695
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,411
Oh, yeah, you two fuckin' Micks
know what's goin' on, huh?

696
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:39,744
- Fuck you both!
- This is not a fuckin' thing you
should gamble on, all right?

697
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,945
I'm the fuck out of here.

698
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,954
Fine! Fuck it!

699
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,786
What kind of flowers you want
at your funeral, you dumb wop?

700
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:51,156
- It's the last time I'm gonna see ya!
- I'll be back at nine!

701
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,629
- Bury the fuckin' cat!
- Listen, you get in there...

702

you get the fuck out quick!

705
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,481
Anybody call for me?

706
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,745
No, man.
Are you sure you're okay?

707
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,049

- What the fuck is wrong with you, Roc?
- The cocksucker sold me out!

722
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,078
Didn't I tell you, Roc?
Did they pull on you first?

723
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,815
What am I doin'?
I'm in it at Lakeview!

724
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,823
Lakeview the deli, Roc?

725
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:31,224

a new fuckin' recruit.
- [Together] Rocco!

726
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:35,355
- What?
- Where's my cat?

727
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:40,691
I killed your cat,
you druggie bitch.

728
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,237
- God. Why?
- What?

729
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:45,001
I felt it would bring
closure to our relationship.

730
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:48,044
- You killed my-my...
- Your what?

She just remembers going down,
but judging from the burn mark
on her back,

989
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:04,531
I think what they did
was use a stun gun on her.

990
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:07,973
Now this guy knows
that his friend is coming
to the game,

991
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:11,843
and they know that this door can
only be opened from the inside.

992
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:15,543
So they wait.
And when that door opens,

993
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,551
man...

994
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,621
nobody's ready for it.

995
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:30,293
Panic, devastation.

996
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:33,129
This was like shootin' fish
in a friggin' barrel.

997
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,031
All of'em.

998
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,287
Now these guys dove
under the table.

999
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:05,390
The trajectory
on the bullet showed that
they came from straight across.

1000
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:08,402
So that means one of our
shooters dropped to his knees.

1001
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:36,557
- Something went wrong right here.
- Shit! Shit! He ain't here!

1002
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:39,328
Oh, what the fuck you mean,
he isn't here?

1003
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:42,234
- I mean he ain't here!
- Look again, for fuck's sake!

1004
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:44,363
I know what the fuck
he looks like!

1005
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:48,738
Look behind ya!

1006
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,744
Ah! Son of a...

1007
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:55,476
Oh, shit!

1008
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,076

- Shoot this motherfucker!

1009
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,951
No!
Fucking let the bloke go!

1010
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:03,958
- Let him go!
- Fuck! Jesus!

1011
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:07,052
- Now's your chance
to earn your stripes, Roc!
- He'll fucking get killed!

1012
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:09,097
It was your idea
to bring him in!

1013
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:11,928
One of these guys
is a real sicko.

1014
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,628
He knew this man.
He wanted him to suffer.

1015
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:17,900
All right, Roc.
Now's your chance!

1016
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:20,441
- You take that man!
- I don't wanna die!

1021
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:52,139
- All right then.
- Fuck you, fuckin'...

1022
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:55,506
Now take a fuckin' deep breath
there, Roc. You did fine.

1023
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:57,511
It was nicely done.

1024
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:04,147
They exited out the front door.

1025
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:07,347
[Smecker]
They had no idea
what they were in for.

1026
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:23,799
Now they're starin'
at six men with guns drawn.

1027
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:26,102
It was a fuckin' ambush.

1028
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:31,111
This was a fuckin'bomb...

1029
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:33,374

1030
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:40,211

this place was Armageddon.

he will.

I've never confessed.

1108
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:22,166
I come here for advice,

not "slalvation."

1110
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:28,973
Why have you come
to a church for counsel
if you're not religious?

1111
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:32,144
It's ethics.

1112
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:35,519
I put evil men behind bars,

1113
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:39,526
but the law has miles
of red tape and loopholes...

1114
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:42,563
for these cocksuckers
to slip through.

1115
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:46,191
I found... out
there are these two guys...

1116
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:48,758
who fix the situation
with an iron fist...

1117
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:50,861
as if they had God's permission.

1118
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:53,373
God's permission?
God doesn't grant...

1119
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:55,375
In this day and age,

1120
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:58,037
I believe what they do
is necessary.

1121
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:00,137
I feel it is correct.

1122
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,513
A soul
is what gives us feelings.

1123
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:05,451
It's like a conduit...

1124
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,353
through which
the Lord speaks to us.

1125
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:11,221
You felt your answers
would be here...

1126
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:14,022
in the house
of the Lord today.

1127
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:18,122
And you feel...
these men are necessary.

1128
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:22,625
So the Lord has spoken to you
twice today.

1129
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:24,638
Has He now?
[Scoffs]

1130
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:29,405
You are the one who came
into this church speaking
about beliefs and feelings.

1131
01:27:29,477 --> 01:27:33,038
Is it so hard to believe
that God has brought you here?

1132
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:35,048
I guess not.

1133
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:38,085
It's very easy
to be sarcastic about religion.

1134
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:41,144
But it's much more difficult...

1135
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:43,281
to take a stand.
[Sighs]

1136
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:48,355
I wanna stand
for what I believe in, Father.

1137
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:51,091
First you have to know
what your beliefs are.

1138
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:56,803
I believe that these young men
are right.

1139
01:27:56,871 --> 01:28:00,398
- You know them personally?
- Yes.

1140
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:03,967
Would they ever harm an innocent
person, for any reason?

1141
01:28:04,045 --> 01:28:07,173
No. They would never do that.

1142
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:09,944
Well, the two
Irish guys wouldn't.

1143
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:12,452
The Italian guy, he might.
He's kind of an idiot.

1144
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:16,149
I'm beginning to see.

1145
01:28:16,224 --> 01:28:19,318
All the things
I wish I could do,

1146
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:21,919
these guys are doing.

1147
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:25,659
W-W-What should I do?

1148
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:29,260
Because I am a man...

1149
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:32,204
who's supposed
to uphold the law.

1150
01:28:32,273 --> 01:28:36,107
The laws of God...
are higher...

1151
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:40,341
than the laws... of man.

1152
