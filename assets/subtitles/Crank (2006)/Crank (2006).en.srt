1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:05,360
Sazu489...

1
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,430
Hector, are we spinning yet?
Nice.

2
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,956
Chelios! How we doing, baby?
And you never call me no more.

3
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,714
Come on, what is that?
Where's the love?

4
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,074
How are you feeling?

5
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,198
I guess you're feeling like shit,
right about now.

6
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,395
Now you can't...

7
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,551
You can't move too good, huh?

8
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,678
You can't breathe too good.
What's wrong with you?

9
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,990
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What is this?

10
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,559
Oh, fuck!

11
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,792
Can you guess what this is?
I bet you can, Chelios.

12
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,190
Hold on, check this out.

13
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,069
Oh! This is plain sick, man!

14
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,232
I must be the motherfucking genius of sick!

15
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,032
Poison Chev Chelios in his sleep?
That's like some Shakespeare or some shit.

16
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,035
You knocked this dude out pretty good!
About to get you a spot on the Dodgers, son.

17
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,232
Maybe you
don't understand what just happened.

18
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,994
I just fucking killed you.

19
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,948
Try not to embarrass yourself
because you're on 'Candid Camera'!

20
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,199
This shit here I gave you!
This is some...

21
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,279
high-tech, sci-fi,
Chinese synthetic bullshit!

22
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,477
I don't exactly know
what's in this shit, dude!

23
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,952
All I know is that once this shit
has binded with your blood cells,

24
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,873
you're fucked, baby,
and believe me it's binded.

25
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,476
Yeah, you got yourself about an hour, max.
Tick-tock.

26
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,392
This shit has been real.

27
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,633
You probably should've
thought twice before you whacked Don Kim.

28
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,634
Experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight?

29
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,518
You know what? Thought so.

30
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,468
Now, you have yourself a nice death.

31
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,829
Asshole!

32
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,432
You like that, huh?
Home run!

33
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,513
<i>It's Eve.</i>
<i>I'm glad you called, but I'm not here.</i>

34
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,318
<i>Leave a message, unless you're</i>
<i>selling something 'cause I'm not interested.</i>

35
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,990
<i>If you're not, then just...</i>
<i>Wait, time's up.</i>

36
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,511
Get a cell phone, honey.
Please?

37
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,272
Come on.

38
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,634
Come on, come on.

39
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,315
Dr, Miles office, may I help you?
- Yeah, let me speak to him.

40
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,916
I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't in.
<i>May I take a message?</i>

41
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,554
Where is he?
- I beg your pardon, sir?

42
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,472
Where the fuck is he?

43
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,868
No... yeah! Wow!

44
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,953
Where you from?

45
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,558
I don't know, sir.
This is his answering service.

46
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,871
<i>Jesus fucking Christ.</i>
- Would you like me to page him?

47
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,268
Yeah, fine.

48
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,274
Please let the doctor know
that Chev Chelios is a dead man,

49
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,433
if he can't call me back within the hour.
- Could you spell that?

50
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,195
Yeah, D-E-A-D! Chelios.
- Yes, sir.

51
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,032
Thank you.

52
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,278
Hello.
- Kaylo, where were you last night?

53
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,035
What's up, Chev?
- I said, where were you last night?

54
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,312
I...

55
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,708
You want to know what I was doing?
- What?

56
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,916
Getting killed, you plum.
- What?

57
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,630
Yeah, you heard me.
Ricky fuckin' Verona...

58
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,677
Ricky Verona?
- Who thought...

59
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,276
that little bitch had the stones
to wet me in my own crib?

60
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,069
I mean, it's inconceivable. Yet, here we are.
- Where are we?

61
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,519
I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen to me.
Put the word out I'm looking for Verona.

62
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,838
Anyone sees him you call me, understand?
- I...

63
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,709
I'm gonna get that fucker
if it's the last thing I do.

64
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,839
It may actually be the last thing I do.
You understand that?

65
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,475
Ricky Verona.
- Copy me on that Kaylo?

66
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,559
Find him!

67
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,752
Hey, man!
- What the fuck you doing?

68
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,276
What the fuck you doing? Where am I going?
- Fuck you!

69
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,908
Bathroom don't work.
What you doing?

70
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,116
Yo, Chevy...
- Where's Verona?

71
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,793
Talk!
- What about?

72
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,633
Don't fuck with me!
- I'm not! Just calm down!

73
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,358
Don't tell me to calm down!

74
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,636
Fuck, man!
- Orlando? You all right?

75
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,715
Hey, there's a white nigger with a gun
up in here! Just be still, motherfuckers!

76
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,873
You see that?
I'm trying to help you here, man.

77
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,553
I gotta find Ricky Verona.

78
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,598
Why would I know where Verona is?
- Yeah, yeah.

79
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,194
You don't know, but you're gonna tell me.

80
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,671
Or I'm gonna
blow your brains into the fuckin' toilet!

81
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,592
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

82
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,671
Whoa! Put your guns down!
The white man is cool!

83
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,310
The white man is...
The white man is cool!

84
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,551
Y'all like them Somalia niggers.

85
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,352
Now look, Chevy came here
to discuss something.

86
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,796
We gonna discuss
this shit in a civilized manner. Chevy?

87
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,915
You had a question? Or a point to make?
- Where's Verona?

88
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,629
Okay, I'm not affiliated with Ricky Verona.

89
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,475
You pulled the Anselmo job together.
Don't fuckin' bullshit me!

90
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,108
Easy! Easy! Easy!

91
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,395
All right?

92
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,998
Look, you're operating under a false
pretence. Ricky and I did not pull...

93
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,709
the Anslemo job together.
Ricky fucked me on the Anselmo job.

94
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,629
In fact, Ricky Verona still owes me $7,5000.

95
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,712
Not how I heard it.
- But that's the way it is.

96
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,156
So, you see, I don't know where Verona is.
If I did,

97
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,233
I'd probably be there right now,
beating the Gucci off his ass.

98
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,436
All right.

99
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,669
All right.

100
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,959
That's what I'm talking about.
That's almost civilized.

101
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,350
Shit, dude.
What's wrong with you?

102
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,358
Just give me some coke. You got any coke?
- Now you're gonna insult me.

103
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,192
Come on, I don't have time!

104
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,960
Just give me something.

105
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,395
I'm really dying, here.
- I can see that.

106
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,437
I'm really fucking dying!

107
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,749
You saying this is medicinal-use coke?
- That's right.

108
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,834
Well?

109
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,592
What?
- This shit ain't free, nigger.

110
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,119
That's enough.

111
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,591
What, you gonna do the shit right here?
Chevy, come on, man!

112
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,276
Oh, God!

113
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,477
Chevy...

114
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,993
Oh! What the...

115
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,472
Oh, that's good. That's good.
- That's good, right?

116
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,549
Why you looking for Verona, anyway?

117
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,718
Some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me.

118
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,838
This is about Don Kim.
- What do you know about it?

119
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,995
I know you pulled the trigger.
- Of course, I pulled the trigger.

120
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,913
Why wouldn't I pull the fuckin' trigger?

121
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,838
Whoa... Yo, Chelios, you good?

122
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,509
This shit ain't working.
- Excuse me?

123
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,678
I know what I have to do.

124
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,679
Well, shit.
A man's got to do what a man's got to do.

125
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,391
What is it you gotta do?
- I gotta kick some black ass.

126
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,079
What?

127
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,673
Shit!
- There he goes again.

128
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,436
Who wants white meat?

129
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,474
You ain't got shit, motherfucker!

130
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,677
Put that fuckin' twig down, bitch!
- Faggot!

131
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,435
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!

132
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,830
Doc?
<i>- What's up, Doc?</i>

133
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,878
You motherfucker!
- Why aren't you dead yet?

134
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,349
What the fuck you doing?
- <i>Coming for you.</i>

135
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,516
Fucking believe me.
- Whatever.

136
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,035
I'll be waiting,
but you won't make it.

137
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,793
You should know that I'm all about hooking up
with that mystery girl, you've been banging.

138
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,796
<i>Soon as you're underground.</i> I forgot
to say so on that gay James Bond tape I left.

139
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,516
What, and then you're gonna rape my
grandmother? Bla, bla, fuckin' bla.

140
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,356
You listen to me. What do you think Carlito
will do when he finds out what you did?

141
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,351
<i>Your whole crew is history!</i>

142
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,431
<i>Driver, pull over!</i>
- Fuck!

143
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,716
Great.

144
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,317
<i>You talking about Carlito?</i>
Because me and Carlito, we're boys now.

145
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,515
We're tight.

146
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,798
Tight, like when your brother
fucked you in 3rd grade?

147
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,436
That's snappy. But I did you pretty good,
didn't I Chelios?

148
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,953
<i>Admit it.</i>
- We'll see.

149
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,269
<i>Pull over!</i>

150
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,631
Know what the best part is?
- Sorry, must go. Bye-bye.

151
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,713
Yeah.
- Doctor Miles.

152
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,269
<i>Fuck! What took you so long?</i>
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

153
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,638
Sorry, Chevy, I just got the message.
- <i>Okay.</i> Forget it. Listen, I'm dying!

154
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,872
I've been poisoned
with some Chinese synthetic shit.

155
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,838
What?
- <i>You've gotta fucking do something for me.</i>

156
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,032
What are your symptoms?
- <i>It's like I'm slowing down.</i>

157
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,031
Stuck in tar.
<i>- Blurred vision?</i>

158
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,999
Yeah.
<i>- Dizzy?</i>

159
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,390
Sure.
<i>- Any pain in your chest?</i>

160
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,630
Not really.
I feel good, right now.

161
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,956
What are you doing?
- Driving through a mall, cops chasing me.

162
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,828
The adrenaline is what's keeping you alive.

163
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,756
Having a little trouble hearing you, Doc.
<i>- You got to keep moving, Chevy.</i>

164
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,749
Explain.

165
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,236
If I'm right,
they gave you the Beijing cocktail.

166
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,108
<i>It's very nasty shit.</i>

167
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,596
<i>It works on the adrenal gland,</i>
<i>blocks it's receptors.</i>

168
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,599
<i>The only thing you can do to slow it down,</i>
<i>is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant.</i>

169
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,311
Meaning, if you stop, you die.

170
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,515
Hang on.

171
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,068
<i>Jesus! What...</i>

172
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,994
<i>Are you there? Are you okay?</i>

173
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,869
What'd you say, Doc?
<i>- If you stop, you die!</i>

174
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,474
That's what I'm trying to do.
Keep moving, keep the blood pumping.

175
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,879
<i>Chevy, you there?</i>

176
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,678
Every time I slow down,
it's like my veins start to rust.

177
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,278
<i>Did you take anything?</i>
- Couple grams of coke.

178
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,352
<i>That's a start.</i>
<i>I'll be in L.A. In an hour.</i>

179
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,354
<i>I'll call you as soon as I get there.</i>
<i>Do not stop moving!</i>

180
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,360
Taxi! Yo, yo, yo!

181
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,598
Go!
- Where we go?

182
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,320
Just drive!

183
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,680
Would you mind?
- Where you want to go, man?

184
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,230
Right.

185
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,392
Oh, shit!
- Go right!

186
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,074
Okay! Yes!
- Go fucking right!

187
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,999
Crank the music.

188
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,391
Crank it!

189
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,876
<i>But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart</i>

190
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,669
<i>I just don't think he'd understand</i>

191
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,549
<i>And if you tell my heart,</i>
<i>my achy breaky heart</i>

192
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,759
<i>It might blow up and kill this man</i>

193
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,193
Pull over, pull over.

194
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,596
Thanks, mate. I'll be back in one minute.
- Okay, cowboy.

195
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,869
Hey, buddy!

196
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,395
You move, you die.

197
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,035
<i>Hey, it's Eve. I'm glad you called...</i>
- Fuck!

198
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,949
Where to, man?

199
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,311
Beverly Hills.

200
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,557
Chevy!
- Hey, boss.

201
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,269
Something urgent has come up.
- So I've heard.

202
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,678
Word travels fast.

203
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,958
Carlito, I need your help.
I don't have a lot of time.

204
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,910
No, not much.
- We've gotta find an antidote, or something.

205
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,195
What's the matter?
- That shit they gave you...

206
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,873
It's that Chinese shit.

207
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,112
There is no antidote.
- What, that's it?

208
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,034
Honestly, you should be dead already.

209
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,077
It's a miracle.
- A miracle?

210
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,912
We give that shit to horses.

211
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,437
You don't have to be
so damn fucking cool about it.

212
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,639
What do you expect me to do?

213
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,392
Find that punk Verona,

214
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,759
and his whole fucking crew,
and feed them to a cage of wolverines.

215
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,198
What is this?
What, are you boys now or something?

216
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,999
Verona?

217
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,673
That's a small time punk.

218
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,916
Not to say that this isn't an opportunity.
- Opportunity?

219
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,799
Everyone knows the love I have for you, Chev.

220
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,669
But maybe this
makes up for the Don Kim hit which was...

221
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,638
perhaps ill-advised.
- Ill-advised?

222
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,037
The heat from Hong Kong was
much more than we anticipated.

223
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,031
Well, that's outstanding.

224
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,112
Glad to know my death
can be of some use to you.

225
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,912
Don't be difficult.
- I'm not being difficult.

226
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,471
I don't know if you noticed, but I'm
having a difficult fucking day, brother!

227
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,397
I'm out of here.

228
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,636
You're not getting in my cab wet!

229
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,989
I just gave you $200 to wait for 3 minutes.
- You're not getting in my car, no way!

230
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,957
Yeah, you're right.

231
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,389
Al-Qaeda!
Al-Qaeda!

232
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,875
I love America!
I love Bush!

233
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,109
I Voted Bush!

234
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,349
Yeah.
- Hey, Chev. My flight's delayed.

235
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,835
Shit!
<i>- It's all right. Relax.</i>

236
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,876
I mean, don't relax. That shit they gave you
is cutting off your adrenaline.

237
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,672
<i>Excitement, fear, danger. It causes your body</i>
<i>to make a chemical called ephedrine.</i>

238
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,313
<i>They introduced an inhibitor to your system.</i>
- Fuck!

239
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,393
<i>Dude, you've got to massively increase the</i>
<i>ephedrine levels in your body,</i>

240
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,120
<i>to force out the inhibitors.</i>
<i>Go to a hospital.</i>

241
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,669
Get epinephrine, an artificial adrenaline.

242
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,793
<i>It comes in 10-milligram syringes.</i>

243
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,629
It's potent, so don't overdo it.
A 5th of an injection will do.

244
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,715
Chevy? Did you get that?

245
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,272
<i>Did you get that?</i>
- Yeah, epi-something.

246
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,153
Okay, okay. I've gotta go.

247
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,109
<i>Now, I'll call you when I get there.</i>

248
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,078
Yeah?
- <i>Chev.</i>

249
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,229
Yeah?

250
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,953
Chev?
<i>- What?</i>

251
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,717
<i>Hello?</i>

252
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,709
Come on!

253
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,359
Mother!

254
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,317
<i>Chev?</i>
- Yes, fuck?

255
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,549
I just saw Verona's brother
walk into the Prince.

256
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,392
The Prince.
- Yeah.

257
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,633
I was just down here getting a taco,
and he walked in, 2 minutes ago.

258
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,111
Where are you, now?
- Across the street, getting a taco.

259
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,159
Where are you?
- I'm there. Meet me on 7th and Catalina.

260
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,432
Is he in there, now?

261
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,830
Did anyone go in with him?

262
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,318
Right, wait here.

263
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:41,238
How'd you like that one, tough guy?
How frickin' awesome was that, huh?

264
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,308
Well, well, well.

265
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,752
You feel like talking?
Where's your fuckin' brother?

266
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,228
Doing your mother like a whore, you bitch!

267
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,637
Nice. I wonder
how many steaks I could carve out of you.

268
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,633
You died, motherfucker!

269
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,396
Yeah, wanna fuck with me, <i>ese?</i>

270
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,798
What, you rolling pin mighty good?

271
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,790
What the hell you think you doing, huh?

272
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,119
What,
you want to dance with me, motherfucker?

273
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,749
I'll fuck you up!
Come on!

274
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,157
Jesus!
Nothing's easy.

275
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,554
Wanna hold hands?

276
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,200
Hey, talk to me, bro.
<i>- Hey, Ricky.</i>

277
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,709
<i>You in the mood for sucking me off?</i>

278
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,992
<i>Maybe let me lick your ass or something?</i>

279
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,799
Who is this?
<i>Shit! Chelios?</i>

280
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,958
Is this fucking Chelios?
<i>- That's right, bro.</i>

281
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,398
<i>Guess how I got your brother's phone?</i>
I'm sure you have it all figured out.

282
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,395
Looks like you should've
cut me up when you had the chance.

283
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,349
I'm having a little trouble hearing you.
You experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight?

284
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,715
You're supposed to be fucking dead!

285
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,112
You know, I kind of like that shit you put in
me. <i>Gonna give me some more?</i>

286
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,319
Well, I'm... I'm...
- I know, I know. Hey...

287
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,869
What's this?

288
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,118
A necklace! You guys really are faggots,
aren't you?

289
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,149
You motherfucker! My grandfather gave
that medallion to my father and then he...

290
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,675
Fuck!

291
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,230
Fuck you, man! Shove that thing up your ass!
- No thanks.

292
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,555
You know, I think I'll hang on to it.
You'll have to come find me, after all.

293
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,269
Fucked up that you killed your own brother.
- You...

294
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,391
What's that shit?
Epi... 10 milligrams?

295
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,274
Good work, Kaylo.

296
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,392
<i>Doctor Sing to the labor room.</i>

297
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,472
<i>Doctor Sing to the labor room.</i>

298
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,477
Asshole!
- No need to push.

299
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,793
I'm looking for
something that starts with "E".

300
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,949
England?

301
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,674
Very funny. No.
Some kind of artificial adrenaline.

302
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,628
Artificial adrenaline?
- Yeah, I've got heart problems.

303
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,712
Epinephrine.
- Yes! Epinephrine.

304
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,916
I love you. Epinephrine.

305
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,318
I can't give you epinephrine.

306
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,035
Why?
- Just a minute.

307
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,832
Oi! What do you mean...

308
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,831
What is this shit?
- Nasal spray.

309
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,797
Miserable bitch!
What?

310
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,997
Nasal spray. It's got epinephrine in it.
It'll get you tweaked, man.

311
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,119
Hey!

312
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,238
Sure that's the guy?
- Yeah.

313
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,198
This room's clear.

314
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,468
<i>Could anyone</i>
<i>speaking Korean please come to ER?</i>

315
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,437
<i>Anyone speaking Korean...</i>

316
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,436
Yo, yo, yo!

317
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,278
Yo!

318
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,589
Stop!

319
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,670
Stop!

320
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,509
Jerk-off!

321
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,076
Coming through!

322
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,875
I know you motherfuckers have epinephrine.

323
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,432
Clear the hallway!
- Corner. Is the OR ready?

324
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,273
I'm having a bad day.
Tell me you've got epinephrine on this cart!

325
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,239
You all right?

326
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,152
Tell me you've got epinephrine!

327
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,392
Motherfucker!
- I don't know. I'll check.

328
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,073
Get back!
- Take it easy!

329
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,990
Do you understand fucking English?
- Yes, I just don't know which draw it's in.

330
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,195
Come on, look!

331
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,513
Give me the fucking epinephrine!
- I don't know where it is, man!

332
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,352
What is this, a rest home?

333
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,794
What are you doing?

334
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,228
Hurry up!

335
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,034
Get back!
- We can't treat without insurance.

336
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,638
I don't know if I have it, give me a second!
- Put the weapon down!

337
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,189
What the fuck!
Where the fuck is it?

338
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,708
My heart!
- What?

339
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,950
My heart!
- Yeah, yeah.

340
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,714
Drop your weapon now!

341
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,311
What do you think you're doing? This is...
- Shut up! You!

342
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,472
Gimme the epinephrine?

343
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,080
Don't even think about it!

344
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,996
Albuterol... Flortab... Epinephrine!
Here it is! I've got it!

345
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,393
Here you go.
- Gimme that.

346
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,269
Asshole.
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

347
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,829
...all right? Just be quiet.

348
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,913
Juice me.

349
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,753
Juice?

350
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,512
Do it.

351
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,829
All right.
- Come on!

352
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,031
I haven't got all day.

353
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,559
Okay, I need both of them to...
Give them to me.

354
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,829
One.

355
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,551
Two. Clear!

356
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,228
Get the fuck back!

357
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,833
Get out!

358
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,876
How much of this stuff did he say to take?

359
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,876
<i>Chevy, we're in the air, man.</i>

360
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,958
Did you get the stuff?
- <i>Got it.</i>

361
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,473
Did you take it?
- Yup.

362
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,517
<i>You took the whole thing.</i>
- Yup.

363
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,797
I said one 5th. The shit's gonna kill you.
- Right.

364
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,313
<i>Chest on fire?</i>
- Check.

365
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,799
<i>But you're cold.</i>
- Check.

366
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,953
And you've got a steel hard on, don't you?
- Let me check.

367
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,028
Check.
- Your blood vessels are stimulated.

368
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,954
Urinary sphincter's so tight,
you couldn't piss to save your life.

369
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,519
Urinary sphincter, check!

370
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,638
<i>Get some Vicodin. You at the hospital?</i>
- Negative.

371
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,555
<i>Get some grass. That shit'll be out of</i>
<i>your system in 30 minutes, or it'll kill you.</i>

372
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,953
This is costing me a fortune.
I'll call you in 20 minutes when we land.

373
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,473
Copy.
<i>- Hey, Chevy?</i>

374
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,475
You're a good dude. Been nice knowing you.

375
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,875
Copy, out.

376
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,032
Some medical emergency.

377
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,353
<i>Police have declined to name</i>
<i>the man they say is still at large,</i>

378
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,080
<i>on a citywide rampage</i>
<i>that has left one man dead,</i>

379
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,398
<i>dozens injured, and hundreds</i>
<i>of thousands of dollars of damage...</i>

380
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,917
<i>in it's smoking, bloody wake.</i>
<i>The suspect is a professional killer...</i>

381
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,958
<i>with ties to organized crime</i>
<i>and a long police record.</i>

382
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,113
<i>He is considered armed and highly dangerous.</i>

383
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,875
<i>We now continue with regularly</i>
<i>scheduled programming,</i>

384
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,795
<i>but stay tuned for continuing coverage</i>
<i>of this bizarre story, as it unfolds.</i>

385
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,677
<i>What your saying is that next to olives,</i>
<i>onions, lemons and limes...</i>

386
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,078
Oh, shit!
Take it easy.

387
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,639
Get back, pig!

388
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,155
I... just give me the...

389
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,675
Come on, then.
Let's see you run, piggy.

390
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,034
Come on, piggy.

391
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,074
Give me the gun.
Let's talk this over.

392
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,313
Yeah, you want it?
There.

393
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,671
Let's go, come on.
- Be careful.

394
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,355
All right.
I'm gonna get some help, all right?

395
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,754
<i>Yeah.</i>

396
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,595
Hey, did you try to call?
<i>- You've been home all day?</i>

397
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,671
I was sleeping in.
- Sleeping in. That's great, Eve.

398
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,478
Super great.

399
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,518
You all rested, now?
<i>Glad to hear it.</i>

400
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,437
Listen, I've been fatally poisoned.

401
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,637
A psychopath's on his way over
to torture and kill you,

402
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,476
but don't get out of bed, I'll be
over in a flash. Could you fry up a waffle?

403
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,953
Sure, yeah. Come on over. I'll be here.
- Right, you'll be there. Okay.

404
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,509
Bye.

405
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,478
So, let's go get the bitch!

406
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,395
Come on, please!

407
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,075
All right, all right. Jesus!

408
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,919
Oh my God!

409
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,951
Is this your new look or something?
- Yeah, you into it?

410
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,595
It's gross.

411
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,992
Are you looking for my other boyfriend?

412
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,789
Yes!

413
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,552
You haven't watched TV today, right?
- No, why?

414
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,474
Didn't think so. Come on, we're leaving.
- Don't be such a freak.

415
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,629
Get dressed.

416
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,590
Actually, can you change the clock on the
microwave? I never changed it back.

417
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,069
What?
- The microwave.

418
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,631
Can you change the clock? The daylight
savings time, I never changed it back.

419
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,354
The microwave?
- Yes.

420
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,513
Listen. I bought some flowers.
They got fucked up on the way over.

421
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,356
That's sweet! You okay?
You look like you're on drugs or something.

422
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,589
You love me, yeah?

423
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,232
Yes.

424
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,752
Then I need you to do something for me.
- What? What's wrong?

425
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,948
I need you to put some clothes on
and come with me, right now.

426
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,032
No.
- I'll change the clock on the microwave.

427
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,236
Okay. All right.

428
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,674
Shit's wearing off.

429
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,477
The waffle iron's on if you want to make one.
- Great.

430
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,871
Great.

431
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,632
You're so stressed out.
Want some pot, or something?

432
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,836
Yeah!

433
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,389
Ready! What's wrong?
- I burned my hand.

434
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,510
Oh, my God! Let me see it!
- Don't worry about it. Hey!

435
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,716
What the...

436
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,429
I'm sorry.
- That was completely uncalled for.

437
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,029
Can we just...

438
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,189
Fine.

439
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,516
Parked out the back.

440
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,069
Darn! That... thing.
- What thing?

441
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,277
The waffle thing, I gotta turn it off.

442
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,989
Hello?

443
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,758
Hello?

444
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,239
<i>All right, very funny.</i>

445
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,153
God, I hate that.

446
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,079
Do you want to burn the building down?

447
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,676
Ouch!
- Sorry, honey.

448
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,996
Nice on, Chev.

449
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,668
Oh, there's my Tiger Balm.

450
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,159
I swear to God, Chev.

451
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,035
I don't know what you're on,
but it isn't working for you.

452
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,149
My hand cream!
That's where you went.

453
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,952
Chev? Can I have some help, here?

454
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,274
Where's your car?
- Actually, I took a cab.

455
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,439
This isn't gonna be...
This isn't gonna be easy, as they say.

456
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,633
Oh, fucker.

457
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,713
All right, here it is.
- Sorry.

458
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,957
I told you I was a video game programmer.
- Yeah?

459
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,270
That was a lie.

460
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,432
Actually...

461
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,673
I kill people.

462
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,871
Professional hitman. I freelance
for a major West Coast crime syndicate.

463
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,198
Last night was a job like 100 others.
High dollar hit, nothing special.

464
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,916
<i>The Triads from Hong Kong</i>
<i>had been moving in on the local drug cartels.</i>

465
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,992
<i>My target was the number 1 man in L.A.,</i>

466
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,434
<i>Don Kim.</i>

467
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,790
Well?

468
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,554
What are you waiting for?

469
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:09,115
<i>Then, this insane idea comes in the back of</i>
<i>my head, like a .45 slug at close range.</i>

470
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,193
Congratulations.

471
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:18,275
Did I win something?
- Your life, jackass.

472
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,673
100 grand wants you dead.
So, sooner or later it's gonna happen,

473
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,718
but I'm not doing it.

474
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,075
I see.

475
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,950
Instead you're gonna do something for me.
You're gonna get out of town, disappear.

476
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,430
I don't care where you go or what you do,

477
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,720
so long as you're invisible for 48 hours.
That's all I ask.

478
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,997
48 hours?

479
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,039
Or, if you prefer,
we can do it the other way.

480
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,433
The way where I go to work,
and you meet Buddha.

481
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,354
See...

482
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,873
I quit.

483
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,079
I quit the business for you.

484
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,309
For me?
- Yeah.

485
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,790
I figure I call you that night
and tell you everything.

486
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,918
We get on a plane,
leave this shit, never come back.

487
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,796
Pretty crazy, huh?

488
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,279
You are so weird.

489
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,551
Are we going on a trip?
- Well...

490
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,556
I might be going on a trip,
but you're not coming with me...

491
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,837
Please! Wait, please!
- Mob hits, Chev?

492
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,709
Chinese poison?
Do you know how ridiculous you sound?

493
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,148
If you're gonna break up with me,
at least you can tell me the truth!

494
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,833
What's wrong with you?

495
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,948
Wait a minute, you trust me?
- No.

496
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,034
Make love to me.
- What?

497
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,308
I think it'll help.
- What? Are you kidding? Get off me!

498
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,439
Take your clothes off.
- No!

499
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,789
No!

500
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,550
You said you wanted to be more spontaneous.
- You're crazy!

501
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,439
You're an adrenaline junkie with no soul!

502
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,912
Save me, Eve. Save my life!
- Stop it!

503
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,479
I'm sorry. Oh my God, are you okay?

504
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,914
Are you okay?

505
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,109
No! No!

506
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,469
Shit!

507
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,469
Get off!

508
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,156
You filthy animal!

509
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,350
Take me right here, in front of everyone!

510
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,558
That's it!

511
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,676
Come on! Do it!

512
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,671
What are you waiting for?
- Jesus!

513
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,512
Come on!
- I'm trying! Shush!

514
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,716
Oh, God! Now you can't get it up?

515
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,472
Come on, get it up!
- I'll fucking get it up!

516
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,631
Goddamnit, Chev!
- Shut up!

517
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,671
I'm alive! I'm alive!

518
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,309
I'm alive, you motherfuckers!

519
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,793
Oh, my God! Wow!

520
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,192
Oh, my God! Yes!

521
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,196
Yeah?
- What are you doing?

522
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,828
Yeah.
<i>- I've got Verona.</i>

523
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,356
Kaylo?
<i>- I've got Verona, man.</i>

524
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,436
What?
- No shit?

525
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,592
Where are you?
- <i>Don Kim's shirt factory, upstairs.</i>

526
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,399
What's the matter with you?
- 5th and Alameda?

527
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,917
Who's at 5th and Alameda?
- Don't let that fucker out of your sight!

528
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,631
Hear me? With you in 10 minutes. You got it?
- Yeah, Chev.

529
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,634
Honey, I gotta go.
I'll call you!

530
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,672
Oh God, what are you looking at?

531
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,435
Hey man, what's the matter with you?
You a crackhead?

532
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:02,913
Right, just step on it, all right?
- You're won't die in my cab, crackhead.

533
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,873
I got something for you.

534
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,113
Take this Haitian shit.

535
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,798
This shit is some hardcore shit.
It's made from plant shit.

536
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,313
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Look at this. You see that?

537
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,712
That's what a man look like, crackhead.
That's power.

538
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,594
Now look at you.

539
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,353
What the hell.

540
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,351
Yeah.

541
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,039
It tastes like ass.

542
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,959
That's right, devil. You wait.

543
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,831
Shut the fuck up!
- No!

544
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,150
No!
- Shut the fuck up!

545
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,432
Whoop, there it is!
Fuck him!

546
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,949
We're here.

547
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,471
What'd you say was in this stuff?
- I told you, it's hardcore.

548
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,477
It's $5.55.

549
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,913
It's all you, man.
- Have a nice day, devil.

550
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,273
This is fucked.

551
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,230
Hey, where's he going?

552
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,351
Yeah, okay. How the fuck you
going to call me, talking shit?

553
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,433
I'm gonna smack the hell out of you.
I don't know where he at...

554
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,955
Fucking call me talking shit!

555
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,360
I'm doing my job.
I'm doing my shit.

556
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,035
I'm up here chillin',
doing what I do. I'm a rooftop mother...

557
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,478
Hey, Chevy! What's up, dog?
You chillin'? You good?

558
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,915
What a coincidence!
- What do you mean?

559
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:58,119
What, you waiting for a bus?
- Actually, I thought a helicopter...

560
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,713
What is this?
- What?

561
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,314
You working for the Chinese?
- The Chinese?

562
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,268
You crazy? I wouldn't do that to you.
- I am crazy. Where's Kaylo?

563
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,758
Okay, ding. Time's up.
- What do you mean, "ding"?

564
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,229
What do you mean, "ding"?

565
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,791
Where is that motherfucker?

566
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,350
Chev.

567
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,070
What the fuck is this?
- Chev, baby. Take it easy.

568
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,078
Oh, you mean like this?

569
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,711
Now you tell me where that
little toe-rag motherfucker is. Verona.

570
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,430
Verona's got nothing to do with this.

571
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,598
What?

572
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,719
Don Carlos wants you off the streets.
- Carlito?

573
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,872
You've totally lost your shit, dog.

574
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,874
You're all over TV. Destroying property,
making unauthorized hits.

575
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:00,077
You're causing the organization
a great deal of embarrassment.

576
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,879
You're telling me Carlito wanted this?
- Look.

577
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,748
Don't worry,
we'll take care of Verona.

578
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,233
The best thing for you to do
is find some nice, dark, quiet place and...

579
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,549
just die.

580
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,593
Just die. You think
I've got "cunt" written on my forehead?

581
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,435
Maybe you're right.

582
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,872
We all got to die sometime, right?
- Yeah.

583
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,554
We all got to die sometime.

584
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,480
So, I'll just die.

585
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,318
What the...

586
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,669
What the...
- You got shot!

587
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,109
Mother...

588
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,468
Jesus!
Eve, move!

589
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,514
You, asshole!
- Don't talk to him like that!

590
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,638
My boyfriend kills people!
- Nice.

591
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,631
Oh, God!

592
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,430
I had to see if you were telling the truth.

593
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,713
Come on.

594
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,715
No, wait!

595
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,029
Now come on.

596
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,551
Oh, God!

597
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,229
Oh, dammit!

598
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,757
I forgot to take my birth control pills.
- What?

599
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,757
Where are the keys? The keys!
- Here.

600
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,993
Come! Come!
- My stuff!

601
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,519
All my stuff!

602
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,195
You weren't lying!
- Welcome to my life.

603
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,670
No, I mean...
that you would give it all up for me.

604
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,754
Yeah.

605
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,234
And the other part?
- The poison's true, too.

606
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,279
Then... that means...

607
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,159
Pretty much, Eve.

608
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,396
How can we stop it?
- Only adrenaline can slow it down.

609
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,069
So, when we were in Chinatown?
- Yeah. Sorry.

610
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,633
What are you doing?

611
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,030
This'll get you going.
- What?

612
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,995
Come on, let's finish what you started.
- Oh, boy.

613
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,953
Oh, that's it.
That's really working for me.

614
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,670
You like that?
- Stay down!

615
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,309
Motherfuck!

616
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,030
Jesus! Yeah, that's it, baby.
Just a little more.

617
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,795
Stay down, Eve.

618
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:52,078
Jesus.
- Oh, you're so big!

619
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,355
Oh my God!

620
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,232
Just a touch...

621
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,636
What's that matter?
- So you can fall asleep like always?

622
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,679
I don't think so.

623
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,350
Jesus! Fuck!

624
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,196
Are they really...

625
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,828
They're dead.

626
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,032
How can you do that?

627
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,714
I told you, baby. I quit.

628
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,389
Yeah.

629
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,518
Shit!
I've been trying to call you for a half hour.

630
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,399
<i>Where the fuck have you been?</i>
- In my office.

631
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,835
Can you make it over here?
- Why not?

632
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,669
Chocolate?

633
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:21,278
What's this fucking receipt
from Gold Foods Market for $254?

634
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,354
Snacks.

635
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,472
I owe you again, Doc.

636
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,349
Chevy, you're my best customer.

637
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,039
What is this stuff?

638
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,713
Synthetic epinephrine...

639
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,111
diluted with some saline.
- Feels sort of good.

640
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,432
Well, I got a little meth in there, too.
You're feeling the endorphins.

641
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,992
Wait a minute.
I'm not better?

642
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,753
No, you're not better.

643
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,675
You're in such shit shape, it's stunning.
I can't believe your heart's beating.

644
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:11,278
You should be in a fucking medical journal.

645
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:20,074
So, what are you going to do?
- The solution acts as a competing inhibitor.

646
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,800
It's pushing
the poison out of your receptors,

647
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,430
and replacing it with a chemical.
It's just a temporary fix.

648
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,589
Then what?

649
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,433
Then you're fucked.

650
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,832
I can put you on life support
and string this out for a few days.

651
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,470
But you're going to
go into a comma at some point.

652
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,358
Does she know?

653
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:52,559
Why don't I load you full of something?
You can go out in a beautiful dream.

654
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,354
A dream.

655
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:01,076
Can I do that for you?

656
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:05,313
No, no, no.
That's not what I want.

657
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,633
What do you want?

658
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:12,992
One hour.

659
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,628
I want one hour.

660
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,873
Give me a fuckin' break.

661
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:35,958
<i>So, the wild rampage that began 9am in L.A.</i>
<i>Continues. The suspect, still at large.</i>

662
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,068
We didn't give him enough Chinese shit.

663
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,913
You think?

664
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,910
Dude, it's him!

665
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,312
What's up, corpse?
<i>- Bonjour, douche bag,</i>

666
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:00,116
Thought you might be interested in a deal.
- <i>Oh, you a dealer, now?</i>

667
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,191
Don't you worry about what I am.

668
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:07,350
<i>Listen, I want the antidote.</i>
- Oh, the antidote?

669
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,195
<i>That's right, the antidote.</i>
- What you prepared to give me?

670
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:16,593
How about that jewelry I got off that faggot
brother of yours, you cocksucker?

671
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,592
<i>Don't pop a blood vessel, you little penis.</i>
- Okay.

672
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,591
<i>You like the deal?</i>
- Whatever!

673
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,109
Be at the downtown Lint in 20 minutes.

674
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,072
<i>You know the spot?</i>
- Yeah.

675
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,949
<i>Don't be late, or I'll trade the</i>
<i>thing to a whore for a hand job.</i>

676
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:34,237
Look, I said I said I'd fuckin' be...
Fuck!

677
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,429
See you later, sunshine.

678
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,632
Dammit! Fuck!

679
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,790
Yo, it's Verona.
You won't believe this call I just got.

680
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,756
It's gonna be all right, baby.

681
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,878
But you said...
- No, no.

682
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,632
Things have changed.

683
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:15,954
There's an antidote. I can
make a deal for it, but I got to go alone.

684
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:19,510
I'm scared.
- Of course.

685
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,148
You'll be safe, now.
And I'll be back.

686
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,158
Promise?

687
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,439
I promise.

688
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,429
What's happening, bro?

689
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,911
<i>Where did I go wrong?</i>
- You fuckin' just say something?

690
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,111
<i>It's like talking to the wall.</i>

691
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,315
Mom?
- <i>I'm amazed you remember you have a mother.</i>

692
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,872
Please, I haven't got time for this.
<i>- You got no time, period.</i>

693
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,557
Orlando?
- <i>You're a persistent motherfucker, Chelios.</i>

694
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,917
<i>I give you that.</i>
<i>They pop you and you keep getting up?</i>

695
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,437
I'm the terminator.
- <i>You was, but here's a new gun in town.</i>

696
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,396
You know, I just don't get it.

697
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,438
Why didn't you cut me up
when you had the chance?

698
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,750
<i>Too easy, motherfucker.</i>
<i>Look at you.</i>

699
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:31,195
<i>Bi-polar, sadomasochistic tendencies...</i>
- <i>Adrenalinejunkie, addicted to violence...</i>

700
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:36,918
<i>Carving up a guy while he screams in his own</i>
<i>blood and excrement, would be like...</i>

701
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,390
<i>like a gift.</i>
<i>A warriors death.</i>

702
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,870
<i>Hell, you'd probably get off on it.</i>
- Who are you, anyway?

703
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,235
I think I'm starting to figure it out.
<i>- Better late than never.</i>

704
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,836
<i>You know you're gonna die up there.</i>

705
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,152
Yeah, maybe.
But I'm taking you with me.

706
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,839
Some pills, Doc.

707
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,477
Chelios?
- Hello, girls.

708
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,949
Hold up.

709
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,633
Give me the piece.

710
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,156
Now, isn't that a fucking picture?
- Chelios.

711
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,071
What a fucking nightmare you are.

712
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,669
No shit.

713
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,315
Sit down.

714
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:06,279
Whoa! Wait a minute.
You pat him down, again.

715
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,791
I know he's carrying something.

716
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,916
Let me see that.

717
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,719
Motherfucker.

718
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,639
Clever. What is this, an insulin pump?

719
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:22,949
Basically.

720
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,952
What the fuck is insulin?

721
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,195
Ephedrine, right?

722
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,031
Yeah.
- You're very resourceful.

723
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,152
Found a new master, little bitch?
- I'm nobody's bitch.

724
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,993
You'll be a bitch when Carlito
hires you for half what he paid me.

725
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,474
That's enough.

726
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,349
You'll throw boss a reach-around,
show him you're a good bitch.

727
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,795
I'm nobody's little bitch!

728
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,279
You fuckin' hear me?

729
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,477
He'll pay me what I tell him to pay!
- That's enough!

730
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,109
Sit down!

731
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,513
It's been a long fucking day.

732
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,309
In the end, you have to admit,
it all works out quite nicely.

733
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,711
Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks to you,

734
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,190
and Hong Kong gets a goat to take the fall.

735
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,556
Please understand, it's nothing personal.
- Speak for yourself.

736
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,239
That what I think it is?

737
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,670
It's the Chinese shit.

738
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,589
Hold him down.

739
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,117
Not so fast, motherfucker!

740
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,430
He's gone dipsy-do, yo!

741
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,432
Whatever, psycho.

742
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,629
I'm afraid the Houdini act is over,
my friend.

743
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,310
Our Father, who art in...
- Shut up!

744
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,392
So, this is how it is.

745
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,988
It's Don Kim! He's supposed to be dead!
- Presto.

746
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,957
Police have moved
to surround the Hotel Lint,

747
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,674
<i>where the madman</i>
<i>behind today's mayhem...</i>

748
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:39,510
<i>is holed up</i>
<i>and making a desperate last stand.</i>

749
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,399
<i>Officials have confirmed</i>
<i>gunfire on the sundeck.</i>

750
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:47,429
<i>Our news chopper will bring live,</i>
<i>uncensored coverage from above the hotel.</i>

751
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:54,392
<i>Again, this coverage is uncensored, so any</i>
<i>small children present should leave the room.</i>

752
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,948
Get me out of here!

753
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,833
I'll kill you, Chelios!

754
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,635
Too late!

755
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,828
Look out!

756
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,194
Thanks, boss.

757
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,632
Let's get the fuck out of here, now!
Let's go!

758
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,154
Present from Kaylo.

759
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,436
Now what?
Now you say shit!

760
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,959
Where the fuck were you?

761
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,559
Who's the bitch, now?

762
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,670
No, no! You fly, motherfucker!

763
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,838
Motherfuckin' fly!

764
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:12,549
You're dead!

765
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:18,158
Oh my God!

766
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,594
You're dead! You're dead, motherfucker!

767
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:02,272
I told you I'd kill you, you little bitch!

768
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,197
<i>Hey, its Eve.</i>
<i>I'm glad you called but I'm not here.</i>

769
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:31,672
<i>Leave a message, unless you're</i>
<i>selling something 'cause I'm not interested.</i>

770
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,310
<i>If you're not, then just...</i>
<i>Wait, time's up.</i>

771
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,838
Hey, doll...

772
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,950
Looks like I let you down, again.

773
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:48,236
<i>Seems like all my life</i>
<i>I'vejust been going... going...</i>

774
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,279
<i>going...</i>

775
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:54,831
I wish I'd taken more time to
stop and smell the roses, so to speak.

776
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,954
Well, I guess it's too late for that now.

777
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:09,396
You're the greatest, baby.
