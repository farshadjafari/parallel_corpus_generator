1
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:08,232
Hike.

2
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:13,707
Stop it!

3
00:00:16,145 --> 00:00:17,160
Go!

4
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:20,391
What's up, boys?

5
00:00:25,552 --> 00:00:27,014
All right, let's go.

6
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:41,766
Let's go. Break.

7
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:49,286
Hike.

8
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:53,029
- What? Where are you going? Come here.
- Oh, my God, Dad.

9
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:56,231
Get in the car.
You're gonna be late for school. Come on.

10
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,730
- Mom's gonna kill you.
- What?

11
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,289
What are you doing?

12
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:02,600
Dad, I'm driving. No.

13
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,643
Get out of the car, Dad.

14
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,139
- What?
- Get out of the car.

15
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:31,714
- Seat belt.
- Yeah.

16
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:37,960
- What's the big deal?
- Can you just get in the car, please?

17
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:17,319
Let's go hunting.
Wanna go hunting this weekend?

18
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,620
Okay, let's go. Where are we going hunting?

19
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,517
You can use that old Jap 243
that Grandpa brought back from Truk.

20
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:26,944
- From where?
- Truk Islands, the South Pacific.

21
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:31,391
- Admiral Halsey, World War II.
- Yeah, right.

22
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,221
I was there.

23
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:37,981
You've been there, right, Dad?

24
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:40,030
No.

25
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:59,814
- Can I take your guys' picture?
- Why?

26
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:03,300
I'm just developing my portfolio right now,
doing random projects.

27
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:05,024
What's a portfolio?

28
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,637
It's when you put together pictures
to present your work.

29
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,097
- Get into galleries, stuff like that.
- What kind of work?

30
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:15,007
Anything. Like, portraits mainly.

31
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,215
- Like, naked people?
- No.

32
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,764
Want us to get naked with you,
take our picture?

33
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:24,388
No. I'm not for the outdoor-naked thing.

34
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:26,692
Public nudity is... No.

35
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,341
- No, we won't do that.
- All right, man.

36
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:30,972
Yeah? Okay, good.

37
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:34,171
You're too kind.

38
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:39,807
All right, let's go.

39
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:42,653
Be a little happier. Come on.

40
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:46,979
There you go.

41
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,181
Kind of look away.

42
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:52,381
Make a funny face.

43
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,230
One more.

44
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:58,041
Yeah, good. Keep walking.

45
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,345
Maybe one kiss.

46
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,308
Perfect. All right,
I actually gotta get to school.

47
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:11,647
- My name's Caroline.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Eli.

48
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:13,569
- Nice to meet you, too.
- What's up?

49
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:17,279
I'll give you guys a print
the next time I see you, or whenever.

50
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:20,990
- I'll try and make one today.
- All right. See you later, man.

51
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:58,012
All right, Dad, you stay here.
Paul will come pick you up.

52
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:09,630
Dad, just stay in the car. I gotta go.
Just stay in the car, please.

53
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,982
Hey, Paul? Yeah, it's John.

54
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,639
Dad's drunk again.

55
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,330
So, Mr. McFarland...

56
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,244
Hi, Mr. Luce. I'm sorry I'm late.

57
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,892
My dad took me out to lunch.

58
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,365
- I mean, breakfast.
- Meet me in my office.

59
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,368
I'm in trouble now.

60
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,381
Will you pick him up?
I'll leave the keys in the office.

61
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:03,703
Can you do it soon?
'Cause I don't know if he's gonna stay.

62
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:19,960
Set. Hike!

63
00:12:23,695 --> 00:12:25,189
He's so cute.

64
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,788
- How are you?
- Good, and how are you?

65
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:02,306
I'm doing pretty good. How was Math?

66
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:06,057
- How do you think?
- That good?

67
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:09,672
That's all right, you know, it happens.

68
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:13,637
How's Sara doing?
Is everything okay with her?

69
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,628
She seemed a little off lately.

70
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,715
Yeah, I guess so. How's school for you?

71
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:23,242
It's about as good as it could be.

72
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,203
- Is P.E. Treating you all right?
- Yeah.

73
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,190
- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes?

74
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,666
- We need to sign out.
- Okay.

75
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:37,545
That picture was taken in Hawaii,
on the island of Maui.

76
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:39,457
What do you need, hon?

77
00:13:52,203 --> 00:13:53,610
Get to class.

78
00:13:54,027 --> 00:13:56,067
Don't be late for detention.

79
00:14:02,122 --> 00:14:05,253
- Excuse me, miss? We need to sign out.
- Where was that picture taken?

80
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:08,201
That picture was taken in Hawaii,
on the island of Maui.

81
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:11,080
- That's real pretty.
- Isn't that cool? What do you need?

82
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,409
I need to leave these keys for my brother.

83
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:16,710
He's gonna come pick them up, 11:30-ish.

84
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:21,541
Put the keys in the envelope,
and put your brother's name on there.

85
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:23,135
His name's Paul.

86
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:29,029
By the way, what time will you be back?

87
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:30,917
Right around 1:30 p.m.

88
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,020
- 11:30 you said?
- Yeah, about.

89
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,008
- Okay, great.
- All right, thanks.

90
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:39,104
And don't forget to bring your own steaks.

91
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,801
- I'll see you then.
- Yeah, okay.

92
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:43,359
I'm saving for my car.
I'm paying it off this month.

93
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:44,412
Surprise!

94
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:31,646
Hello.

95
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,178
Hi.

96
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:38,660
What's wrong?

97
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:40,511
Nothing.

98
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:43,323
- You were crying.
- Yeah.

99
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:46,911
- Is it something bad?
- I don't know.

100
00:15:49,957 --> 00:15:53,372
I'll see you later. I have to go
to a Gay-Straight Alliance meeting.

101
00:15:53,476 --> 00:15:54,491
Okay.

102
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:09,274
Hi, Acadia, how you doing?

103
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:12,896
We were talking about
walking down a street being gay.

104
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:15,549
What do you think about that?
How can you tell?

105
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:18,019
- Or can you tell?
- Good question.

106
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:20,991
See, that's the thing. I don't think you can.

107
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:23,612
I think in some situations you can tell...

108
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:26,236
and there are situations
where people want you to know.

109
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,405
What makes you think you can tell?
If somebody wants you to know.

110
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:31,034
If someone has...

111
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:34,808
dyed pink hair.

112
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:37,278
Wait, what do you think about that?

113
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:40,506
I know it is,
but what do you think about that?

114
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:43,164
I don't think that wearing pink...

115
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:46,172
indicates your
sexual orientation necessarily.

116
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:48,991
- A lot of men wear pink.
- It is a lot, yeah.

117
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,367
Like rainbow necklaces.

118
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:53,848
I mean, if you have
tons of rainbow paraphernalia...

119
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,952
Jump in on this.
Help them out here a little bit.

120
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,617
Come on.

121
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:02,104
Did you guys see the cover story
on The Oregonian about the gay rams?

122
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,111
Yeah. See, this is a good topic here.
Go ahead.

123
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:08,632
Because apparently the farmers can't tell
if the rams are gay or not.

124
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:12,599
So you get a ram to breed and it's not...

125
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:16,703
so they waste a lot of money.
So they're doing all this research.

126
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:19,135
They spend, like, $10,000 on a ram.

127
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,534
That's a lot of money for one ram.

128
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:26,325
But the scary thing is
if they know what causes homosexuality...

129
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:29,499
is that something you could change,
something you could remove?

130
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,869
There's all this
weird political stuff around it.

131
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,164
I don't think we're talking about
the change, necessarily.

132
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,947
We're talking about
if we notice somebody on the street...

133
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:40,415
if we can tell they're gay.
I don't think you can.

134
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:42,552
How in the world do we know their spirit?

135
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,484
If they wear one of those bracelets,
the rainbow and stuff, that's a giver.

136
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:49,723
Somebody walking on the street,
all dressed up, wearing high heels...

137
00:17:49,824 --> 00:17:53,053
Rainbow bracelets don't necessarily mean
that you're gay.

138
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:56,153
I've never seen anybody wear one
that isn't gay.

139
00:17:57,311 --> 00:18:01,271
- Me, for example.
- Then why would it even matter?

140
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:05,436
You're wearing a bracelet
and you're not gay. Who cares either way?

141
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:09,309
- What time will you be back?
- Right around 1:30 p.m.

142
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:10,581
Okay.

143
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,021
Here's the deal.

144
00:18:16,414 --> 00:18:19,064
Aaron and I and some of the other boys...

145
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,784
we're gonna go fourbying later today.

146
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:26,329
We were wondering if maybe you would
like to bring some of the girls along.

147
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:29,747
Don't you remember
what happened last time?

148
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:32,668
- Of course. How could I forget?
- With Sara and Jessica?

149
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:36,857
- Sara and Jessica, they're...
- Don't be mean.

150
00:18:36,957 --> 00:18:40,219
I never tease you about Jason
and his hot dogs, or whatever.

151
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:42,584
That was an isolated incident.

152
00:18:43,517 --> 00:18:45,818
Besides, I don't know if I can go.

153
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:48,660
I don't know what time I'll get home.

154
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,315
- Home from the appointment?
- Yeah.

155
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:55,768
Does that, by any chance, have to do with...

156
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,348
when we went camping,
two or three weeks ago?

157
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,655
I don't know. It could be anything.

158
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:05,841
You know what? You don't have to worry
about it. You know why?

159
00:19:05,948 --> 00:19:08,315
Because we're gonna
have a blast fourbying...

160
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:10,746
as long as...
You gotta promise to show up.

161
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,582
- Hey, Eli!
- What's up, John?

162
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:20,723
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

163
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,286
- What are you doing?
- Just taking pictures.

164
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:26,038
- Can I take a picture of you?
- Yeah, sure.

165
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:31,154
Okay, ready? One, two, three.

166
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:33,238
- Nice.
- I'll see you later.

167
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:36,663
- You going to the concert tonight?
- No, my parents are being bitches.

168
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:38,584
That's retarded. That happens.

169
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:40,504
All right. I'll see you.

170
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,625
Boomer!

171
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:38,227
Come here.

172
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:49,649
What are you guys doing?

173
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,790
Get the fuck out of here
and don't come back.

174
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:54,829
- Some heavy shit's going down.
- What are you doing?

175
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:12,843
When the electrons jump
from one orbital to another one...

176
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:17,106
what does that do?
What's the difference between the orbitals?

177
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:19,949
The orbitals differ in energy.

178
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:23,506
The orbitals, which are areas in space
around the nucleus...

179
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:26,638
the ones that are closer to the nucleus,
those are low energy...

180
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:29,294
and the ones that are further away
are higher energy.

181
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:32,561
So when we put energy into the atom...

182
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:34,832
it kicks these electrons out...

183
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:38,412
further away from the nucleus,
and produces a higher... Yes?

184
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:41,675
After putting electricity
into the tube full of the electrons...

185
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:45,971
after they're lit up, do they stay lit up
or can they run out of energy?

186
00:21:46,068 --> 00:21:48,305
Good question. What they do...

187
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,693
is they will sit up
in this higher energy state...

188
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:54,192
and then drop down again.

189
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:56,942
And when they drop down, they emit light.

190
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,385
What are you writing?

191
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,471
- This?
- Yeah.

192
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:11,591
It's my plan.

193
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:13,452
- For what?
- You'll see.

194
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:31,235
- Hey, Eli, what's up?
- Hey, how are you?

195
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:34,657
Not much. I'm just gonna go
to the darkroom and stuff, so...

196
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:38,347
Yeah. Watch out for Mr. Robertson's class.

197
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,069
Yeah, I know. No kidding.

198
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:42,561
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Okay. Bye.

199
00:25:19,882 --> 00:25:21,770
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, actually.

200
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:23,557
- How about you?
- Fine.

201
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:56,833
Michelle, look, we've got to talk
about this gym clothes problem.

202
00:26:56,934 --> 00:26:59,389
This is not gonna do it, these long pants.

203
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,981
Everybody else is wearing shorts.
What's the matter?

204
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:03,907
I don't want to talk about it.

205
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:06,853
I don't want to give you a mark
against you, either.

206
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:09,600
But I'll have to do it
if you can't show up in shorts...

207
00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:11,042
like you are supposed to.

208
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:13,443
Look, I won't do anything about it
this time...

209
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:17,435
but tomorrow, I want to see those shorts.

210
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:18,877
Okay!

211
00:31:17,754 --> 00:31:21,049
There's that nerd girl
who sits behind you in Math class.

212
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,730
- That one right there.
- Yeah. Her.

213
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:31,859
Green panties?

214
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,956
Loser.

215
00:33:15,156 --> 00:33:18,189
- Where'd you take that at?
- The bleachers outside.

216
00:33:18,452 --> 00:33:20,175
Pretty blurry, though.

217
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:35,026
- What's that?
- It's a rip in his shirt.

218
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:37,708
I thought it was coming out of her head.

219
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:43,212
- I took that outside at the park earlier.
- Really?

220
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:54,795
That's pretty. Where'd you take that at?

221
00:33:55,794 --> 00:33:57,103
At my house.

222
00:33:57,906 --> 00:33:59,848
That's my light assignment.

223
00:34:01,425 --> 00:34:05,353
Great contrast. I like how you can barely see
the fence right there.

224
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:35,085
I think I'll make another print, though.
It came out too light.

225
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:39,364
Yeah, you should burn in right here.

226
00:35:55,084 --> 00:35:56,677
- Hey, Eli.
- What's up, John?

227
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,503
- How's it going?
- Good, how about you?

228
00:35:58,604 --> 00:36:01,222
- Pretty good. What are you doing?
- Just taking pictures.

229
00:36:01,324 --> 00:36:03,625
- Can I take a picture of you?
- Yeah, sure.

230
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:08,132
Okay, ready? One, two, go.

231
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:11,337
- Nice.
- All right, I'll see you later.

232
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:14,567
- You going to the concert tonight?
- No, my parents are being bitches.

233
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:16,161
That's retarded. That happens.

234
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:17,860
All right. See you.

235
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,248
Come on out here.

236
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:08,932
I got a job for you here.
You can take these books...

237
00:37:09,064 --> 00:37:12,839
and you can reshelf them right over there,
if you would, please.

238
00:37:13,928 --> 00:37:15,936
I'll be here if you need me.

239
00:37:25,448 --> 00:37:27,520
- That's what they told me.
- I don't know.

240
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:30,558
- I mean, it's really hard to decide.
- Yeah, I know.

241
00:37:31,464 --> 00:37:34,017
I mean, the money's really nice, but...

242
00:37:36,135 --> 00:37:37,345
He's so cute.

243
00:37:37,447 --> 00:37:38,908
- Did she see you?
- Who?

244
00:37:39,015 --> 00:37:40,509
Did she see you?

245
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:43,037
- Who?
- Her. His girlfriend.

246
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:45,253
He has a girlfriend? Since when?

247
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:46,976
- You didn't know?
- No, I didn't.

248
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:48,224
A long time.

249
00:37:48,327 --> 00:37:50,661
- Are you joking?
- I hope she didn't see you.

250
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:53,922
- She's not gonna do anything.
- She hit a girl last time for that.

251
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,161
- Hit a girl?
- She slapped a girl.

252
00:37:56,262 --> 00:37:57,375
No way.

253
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,069
She smiled, he smiled, and she slapped her.

254
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:02,468
My gosh, I cannot believe that.
Are you joking?

255
00:38:02,566 --> 00:38:04,770
- I saw it.
- Why wouldn't she slap him?

256
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,561
- Because...
- It's not the girl's fault.

257
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:07,938
All girls do that.

258
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:10,885
- In the middle of the hall?
- Yeah. After school last Friday.

259
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:14,048
Wow, I am so tired.
I haven't been getting any sleep lately...

260
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,445
'cause every morning, I wake up
and my mom's going through my stuff.

261
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,429
- Going through your stuff?
- Yeah.

262
00:38:19,526 --> 00:38:22,209
Completely, like,
ruffling through my covers and like...

263
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,903
- Your covers?
- Yeah.

264
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:27,005
Like, what would I hide there?
What am I gonna be hiding?

265
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:29,411
I don't know.
Didn't your mom used to do that to you?

266
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:32,640
She did that a couple days ago.
She was going through it, and I said:

267
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:34,977
"Don't go through my shit.
I don't go through yours.

268
00:38:35,077 --> 00:38:37,662
"It's not like you own my stuff.
I don't own your stuff."

269
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:40,514
I don't know. I talk to her about it,
and she'll be like:

270
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:43,034
"Okay, I'm sorry. I won't do it anymore."

271
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,752
And then all of sudden, I'll come home,
and she's in my room.

272
00:38:46,884 --> 00:38:50,145
They think it's their job
because they're the parents of the house.

273
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,244
I'm sick of it. I want out of here.
I'm so ready to go to college.

274
00:38:53,348 --> 00:38:55,136
Yeah, I wanna get out of here.

275
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:58,170
Only one more year, though, you guys.

276
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:00,738
One more year. Count it down.

277
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,843
- What to eat?
- I can't wait to go off campus.

278
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:09,826
- Can I help you?
- Can I have a milk?

279
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:12,344
Wait, no, I think I want a Capri Sun.

280
00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:15,521
- Can I have a juice?
- I'll have that milk. Thanks.

281
00:39:15,618 --> 00:39:17,112
Juice. This one.

282
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,330
Yeah. Thanks.

283
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:22,719
What do I want?

284
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:26,816
- None of it looks that good.
- It never does.

285
00:39:27,426 --> 00:39:29,565
- Some kids like this stuff.
- Thank you.

286
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:32,480
I know, they come back for, like,
seconds and thirds.

287
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,334
They just keep coming?

288
00:39:42,721 --> 00:39:43,649
Salads?

289
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:15,257
It's too crowded. Let's go to the back.

290
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,613
- Where's a table nobody's sitting at?
- Where's your salad dressing?

291
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,606
- I don't eat salad dressing anymore.
- You don't? I thought you loved it.

292
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:27,257
No, I hate it. I used to like it,
and then I tried once without it.

293
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,010
- I cannot stand it without.
- You know it has fat?

294
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:32,413
You know salad dressing has
20 grams of fat in it?

295
00:40:32,511 --> 00:40:34,877
- Shut up.
- It's not like it stays in us anyway.

296
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,731
I can't believe you just said that.

297
00:40:36,831 --> 00:40:39,252
- What if somebody heard you?
- It's the truth.

298
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:41,052
Is that John?

299
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:43,029
What is he doing?

300
00:40:43,134 --> 00:40:45,207
- Is that a dog?
- I didn't know he had a dog.

301
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,677
Why would he bring it to school
if he did have a dog?

302
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:50,327
- I have no idea.
- Maybe he just found it.

303
00:40:56,446 --> 00:40:58,421
You guys want to go shopping today?

304
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:00,217
That sounds like fun.

305
00:41:00,446 --> 00:41:02,868
I don't know. Ben wanted to do something.

306
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:04,916
- Are you joking me?
- What?

307
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:09,203
This is the fifth day in a row
you're not hanging out with us.

308
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:12,440
You guys, it's like,
how much time do you want?

309
00:41:12,926 --> 00:41:14,551
Put a number on it.

310
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:19,349
I don't even want to talk about it.
You spend so much time with him.

311
00:41:19,452 --> 00:41:22,235
You get, like, 75% to 85% of my time.

312
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:24,412
- Yeah, right. More like 20%.
- You do!

313
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:26,550
School, after school...

314
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:30,395
You know, you can't have both weekends.
I need to split it a little more evenly.

315
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:32,664
We're not just people
to be pushed out of the way.

316
00:41:32,764 --> 00:41:35,415
I'm not saying that.
You're both very important to me.

317
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:38,363
I'm supposed to be your best friend
and you pushed me out of it.

318
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,005
You're both equally as important,
but my time has to be split up.

319
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:44,442
What do you want? 95% and he gets 5%?

320
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,249
Your friends are supposed to be
just as important, if not more.

321
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:53,236
- All the time. Haven't you ever heard that?
- I've heard that, but it's different.

322
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,990
I've been there for you, through everything.

323
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:59,888
We've been best friends for, what,
three years now? Since high school started.

324
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:03,410
- I know, I'm working.
- I'm done, guys.

325
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:05,146
Let's just go.

326
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:09,940
I'm going shopping.

327
00:42:10,746 --> 00:42:11,990
Sounds like fun. I'll go.

328
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:14,840
I don't want to be
the only one not going. I'll go.

329
00:42:14,938 --> 00:42:17,174
Okay, I'll go, but you cannot drive.

330
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:19,030
Yeah, you're not driving.

331
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,755
I am such a good driver.

332
00:42:20,858 --> 00:42:23,956
- You are not.
- That's mean. You guys can't say that.

333
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:32,946
I don't understand because everyone else
thinks I'm a good singer...

334
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,864
and a couple of weeks ago,
when I sang Star-Spangled Banner...

335
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:37,750
everyone thought it was really good.

336
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:41,559
That's why I'm really confused
that you would say something like that.

337
00:42:41,785 --> 00:42:45,047
Seriously, I mean, why?
Why do you think I'm such a bad singer?

338
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,959
Do you guys have cars?
Because I don't think you do.

339
00:42:48,057 --> 00:42:50,097
So, how else are you
going to get anywhere?

340
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,102
We'll go, just drive 15 under the speed limit.

341
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:55,216
You have to have your hands at ten and two.

342
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,262
- That's no fun.
- Go back to the basic rules.

343
00:42:57,368 --> 00:42:59,539
When you guys get your licenses,
you'll understand.

344
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,771
We'll understand?
I just want to live to get my license.

345
00:43:03,128 --> 00:43:06,444
- We want to live to see the rest of our lives.
- I'm not gonna kill you.

346
00:43:06,552 --> 00:43:07,829
It'll be in the newspaper...

347
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:10,829
I might run into a couple of people
on the way, but...

348
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:12,365
It's not funny.

349
00:43:13,112 --> 00:43:17,040
Oh, my gosh. It'll be fine. We'll just go.

350
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,705
- This is disgusting.
- I ate too much.

351
00:43:22,807 --> 00:43:25,262
I always feel so fat after I'm done eating.

352
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:27,697
- Every time.
- Do you ever get...

353
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:30,482
- The pudge there?
- Where it sticks out above your belt?

354
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:33,004
And you can't get rid of it, no matter what.

355
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:36,946
So gross.

356
00:45:46,448 --> 00:45:47,877
That's awesome.

357
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,644
What's up?

358
00:48:48,904 --> 00:48:50,082
You suck.

359
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,290
- See you tonight, dear.
- Yeah.

360
00:51:36,095 --> 00:51:39,740
You know, Jared's got the pole this week
and the track record.

361
00:51:55,711 --> 00:51:57,237
What's that smell?

362
00:51:57,631 --> 00:51:59,453
That's just your mom.

363
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:04,441
You could find other places to eat.
I'm sure there's better restaurants in town.

364
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:06,200
No, you're the best.

365
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,333
- Want more of these?
- No thanks.

366
00:52:15,742 --> 00:52:17,630
All right, lock the door.

367
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,150
The radio has wholly taken over.

368
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:33,720
Many of the cinema's...

369
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:36,210
- What was that?
- I don't know.

370
00:52:38,205 --> 00:52:40,212
All scripts must now be vetted.

371
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:45,305
The casting of actors must be approved.
From now on...

372
00:52:45,405 --> 00:52:49,463
the German people will only know
what their Fuhrer wants them to know.

373
00:52:49,564 --> 00:52:51,353
Propaganda brought us into power.

374
00:52:51,452 --> 00:52:52,859
That's a lot of flags.

375
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,369
- This was made in Germany, right?
- Yeah.

376
00:52:56,476 --> 00:52:59,377
Propaganda will enable us
to conquer the world.

377
00:53:00,732 --> 00:53:03,993
In his early Munich days,
Hitler had taken an old Hindu symbol...

378
00:53:04,092 --> 00:53:07,256
the hooked cross, the Swastika,
as the Nazi symbol.

379
00:53:07,836 --> 00:53:10,323
Now he multiplies it a million times.

380
00:53:17,467 --> 00:53:19,572
From the Romans, he steals the standards...

381
00:53:19,675 --> 00:53:23,635
- Can you still buy Nazi flags?
- Sure, if you're a nut.

382
00:53:25,274 --> 00:53:28,056
From Mussolini, he steals the Fascist salute.

383
00:53:29,722 --> 00:53:31,096
Check it out.

384
00:53:33,851 --> 00:53:36,567
Fuhrer, command, we follow you.

385
00:53:37,786 --> 00:53:40,208
The Fuhrer is always right.

386
00:53:42,746 --> 00:53:43,826
Who's that guy?

387
00:53:44,473 --> 00:53:46,131
- That's Hitler, right?
- Yeah.

388
00:53:46,234 --> 00:53:48,722
...who fears the intellect
and hates all intellectuals.

389
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:52,371
So into the flames are flung the works
not only of German philosophers...

390
00:53:52,473 --> 00:53:55,321
scientists, doctors, poets,
playwrights, novelists...

391
00:53:55,417 --> 00:53:57,173
but those of all the world.

392
00:53:57,529 --> 00:54:00,660
Students as well as storm troopers
obey the Fuhrer's orders.

393
00:54:00,761 --> 00:54:04,405
Any culture except Nazi Kultur
must be destroyed.

394
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:07,667
Hey, how you doing?

395
00:54:08,569 --> 00:54:10,391
You guys must be out of school today.

396
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,147
- Yeah.
- Good for you.

397
00:54:13,144 --> 00:54:15,152
I'll have you sign for me here.

398
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,941
That's great. Thank you very much.

399
00:54:25,464 --> 00:54:26,990
Sweet. It's here.

400
00:54:31,704 --> 00:54:33,460
At a vast meeting in Berlin...

401
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:37,869
Mussolini thanks Germany for her help
in his brutal Abyssinian War.

402
00:54:45,943 --> 00:54:47,765
And the Fuhrer replies. ;

403
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,979
- Oh, yeah, dude.
- This is so awesome.

404
00:54:56,215 --> 00:54:58,189
"Peace," did Hitler say?

405
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:04,369
Let's check this shit out, man.

406
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,115
- Hell, yeah, dude.
- Sweet.

407
00:55:23,605 --> 00:55:24,335
Back up.

408
00:55:35,284 --> 00:55:37,357
Whoa, dude, that was awesome.

409
00:56:24,082 --> 00:56:25,064
Hey, Eli!

410
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:26,697
- What's up, John?
- How's it going?

411
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:28,177
- Pretty good. And you?
- Good.

412
00:56:28,274 --> 00:56:30,608
- What are you doing?
- Just taking pictures.

413
00:56:30,706 --> 00:56:33,040
Can I take a picture of you?

414
00:56:40,786 --> 00:56:42,760
- Nice.
- I'll see you later.

415
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:46,411
- You going to the concert tonight?
- No, my parents are being bitches.

416
00:56:48,049 --> 00:56:49,423
- All right.
- See you.

417
00:57:29,007 --> 00:57:31,341
Hi, Michelle. Glad you could make it.

418
00:57:31,439 --> 00:57:33,740
Please come in and sign in here,
then come out.

419
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,741
There are a few things
we can work on together.

420
00:57:38,671 --> 00:57:41,126
First, if you want to just take this
cart of books...

421
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,816
and you can reshelf it over there
in the non-fiction.

422
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,820
I'll be right here to help you if you need me.

423
00:58:50,475 --> 00:58:53,159
I guess this is it. We're gonna die today.

424
00:58:56,204 --> 00:58:59,105
Yeah, I've never even kissed anybody.
Have you?

425
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:14,087
"I don't appreciate you
putting signs out like that."

426
00:59:14,187 --> 00:59:17,699
The next day, he called up his friend
and has him put out another sign.

427
00:59:17,802 --> 00:59:21,730
And she doesn't see it.
And so he puts out another one.

428
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:27,455
Like, right in front of her house,
in front of her apartment thing.

429
00:59:27,914 --> 00:59:29,059
It says:

430
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:33,825
"Tim Campbell's whorehouse
has been shut down."

431
00:59:34,057 --> 00:59:38,148
Or "Has been placed under new ownership
by" whatever her name was.

432
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,800
He couldn't cut it anymore.

433
00:59:41,321 --> 00:59:44,550
All right, let's see this.
So, we'll park here, right?

434
00:59:46,825 --> 00:59:48,614
We'll enter through the south entrance.

435
00:59:51,752 --> 00:59:55,746
Then we go past the trophy case and the
medal case, enter through the language lab.

436
00:59:55,848 --> 00:59:58,117
They don't use it anymore,
so nobody'll be there.

437
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,609
We'll gear up there,
we'll hear the primary explosions...

438
01:00:04,712 --> 01:00:06,600
go about here in the cafeteria, right?

439
01:00:10,472 --> 01:00:12,839
When that goes, we should be able
to pick off kids...

440
01:00:12,936 --> 01:00:14,342
as we traverse the east wing.

441
01:00:16,263 --> 01:00:19,776
And then we have another explosion
that should go off here in the gym...

442
01:00:19,879 --> 01:00:21,602
and here in the auditorium.

443
01:00:21,703 --> 01:00:24,769
At that time, there should be
kids flushing out in all directions...

444
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,042
and we'll be able to pick them off,
one by one.

445
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:38,240
After that, you'll hit your yellow line here,
which is your plan B.

446
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:41,885
And you'll go up through Mr. Luce's office
and take care of that.

447
01:00:43,846 --> 01:00:44,861
Fuck!

448
01:00:44,966 --> 01:00:47,486
While I go, on the red line,
up through this hallway...

449
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:50,339
where we'll have the best targets,
dumb-ass jocks and shit.

450
01:00:51,205 --> 01:00:53,758
Because we'll have a fucking
field day down there.

451
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:57,244
I mean, come on.
You've got your Tec-9 and your rifle...

452
01:00:57,541 --> 01:01:00,029
and I've got my shotty and my.223
on my back.

453
01:01:00,134 --> 01:01:02,522
And I got a couple pistols and a knife.

454
01:01:02,629 --> 01:01:05,476
We have enough explosives to last us
almost a day.

455
01:01:05,573 --> 01:01:07,962
- Most importantly, have fun, man.
- Yeah, man.

456
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:40,414
What are you guys doing?

457
01:02:40,513 --> 01:02:44,636
Get the fuck out and don't come back.
Some heavy shit's going down.

458
01:02:53,184 --> 01:02:54,972
Hey, don't go in there.

459
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:59,774
Hey, you guys, don't go in there.
Something bad is gonna happen.

460
01:03:00,287 --> 01:03:02,142
Don't go in there, okay?

461
01:03:12,095 --> 01:03:13,753
Dude, what the fuck?

462
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:17,433
Don't worry about it, it's probably just slow.
Let's go to plan B.

463
01:03:17,535 --> 01:03:20,185
- Are you sure you set it right?
- Positive.

464
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,845
Sir, don't go in there! Trust me!

465
01:03:34,942 --> 01:03:37,560
Just don't go in there, please. Don't go in!

466
01:03:39,102 --> 01:03:40,084
Dad!

467
01:04:25,979 --> 01:04:27,408
Hey, you guys...

468
01:04:52,795 --> 01:04:54,201
What was that?

469
01:04:54,522 --> 01:04:58,318
- Sounded like bombs. That's fine.
- No more homework, no teachers.

470
01:04:58,746 --> 01:05:00,950
- That'd be so cool.
- That'd be nice.

471
01:05:01,722 --> 01:05:03,609
- Hi.
- What's wrong?

472
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,329
What the hell is wrong with you?

473
01:05:06,426 --> 01:05:07,952
Okay, then be a bitch.

474
01:05:08,954 --> 01:05:10,328
What a freak.

475
01:05:19,481 --> 01:05:22,033
I think maybe everyone could bring...

476
01:05:22,265 --> 01:05:25,363
Well, I don't drink soda,
but some people do...

477
01:05:26,585 --> 01:05:27,533
What was that?

478
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:29,779
Firecracker. Don't worry about it.
It'll be okay.

479
01:05:29,881 --> 01:05:32,117
Come on, sit down. Let's finish this.

480
01:05:32,216 --> 01:05:35,118
Okay now, we talked about
what we're gonna do...

481
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,639
Nate? Come on, get up, Nate.

482
01:06:44,725 --> 01:06:46,612
Here we go, let's go.

483
01:07:44,818 --> 01:07:47,339
Come on, let's go, now!

484
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:48,816
It sounds clear. Go!

485
01:07:48,914 --> 01:07:51,467
Down the hallway to the band room exit!

486
01:07:51,922 --> 01:07:53,328
Hey, Mr. Luce.

487
01:07:56,242 --> 01:07:58,511
Why are you doing this?
Eric, put the gun down.

488
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:00,519
I ain't putting shit down!

489
01:08:02,002 --> 01:08:04,140
Put the gun down, we'll talk about this.

490
01:08:04,241 --> 01:08:05,223
Shut up!

491
01:08:17,488 --> 01:08:18,470
Dad!

492
01:08:23,889 --> 01:08:25,579
The school's on fire.

493
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,266
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, what's going on?

494
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,022
I saw two guys come in the other side.

495
01:08:31,152 --> 01:08:32,494
Holy cow!

496
01:08:33,104 --> 01:08:36,453
They had big black bags
and camo gear on.

497
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,738
My God.

498
01:08:38,544 --> 01:08:41,130
- Where did you go?
- I just...

499
01:08:42,895 --> 01:08:44,139
I'm sorry.

500
01:09:16,366 --> 01:09:20,424
Yeah, you did, and I should shoot you
right now for it, you know I should.

501
01:09:20,526 --> 01:09:24,552
But I think I just might let you live,
maybe, because I want you to know this...

502
01:09:24,654 --> 01:09:27,403
and the next kids that come up to you
with their problems...

503
01:09:27,502 --> 01:09:30,185
that they're being picked on,
you should listen to them...

504
01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:32,586
no matter what twisted shit they say.

505
01:09:39,725 --> 01:09:40,740
Fuck.

506
01:09:41,037 --> 01:09:43,012
Anyway, Mr. Luce, whatever.

507
01:09:44,236 --> 01:09:47,106
You know there's others like us
out there, too.

508
01:09:47,212 --> 01:09:51,336
And they will kill you if you fuck with them
like you did me and Jared.

509
01:09:52,205 --> 01:09:55,172
Get out of here,
before I change my mind. Go!

510
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:06,947
Bitch.

511
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:40,421
"So foul and fair a day I have not seen."

512
01:11:10,984 --> 01:11:11,999
Fuck!

513
01:11:37,703 --> 01:11:40,070
- Oh, my God, there he is!
- Oh, shit!

514
01:12:50,628 --> 01:12:54,173
Hey, man. I wouldn't drink that.
You'll get herpes or something.

515
01:12:56,772 --> 01:12:59,805
- So how did you do?
- Did all right. What happened?

516
01:13:00,291 --> 01:13:03,291
I shot the principal
and some other people, and...

517
01:14:05,889 --> 01:14:07,482
Well, well, well.

518
01:14:09,888 --> 01:14:11,317
Look who it is.

519
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,855
Dude, come on, don't do this.

520
01:14:13,952 --> 01:14:15,479
- Eeny...
- You stupid fuck!

521
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:17,078
...meeny...
- What are you doing?

522
01:14:17,184 --> 01:14:18,613
...miny...
- Please.

523
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,411
...moe.
- Don't.

524
01:14:20,511 --> 01:14:23,381
- Catch a tiger...
- This isn't something you wanna do.

525
01:14:23,487 --> 01:14:26,651
...by his toe.
- Please.

526
01:14:26,752 --> 01:14:28,988
If he hollers...

527
01:14:29,343 --> 01:14:32,507
- You're fuckin' sick. Don't do this.
...let him go.

528
01:14:32,607 --> 01:14:33,851
Eeny...

529
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,387
meeny...

530
01:14:35,743 --> 01:14:36,987

531
01:14:38,367 --> 01:14:39,349
moe.
