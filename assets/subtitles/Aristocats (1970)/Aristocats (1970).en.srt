Naturellement

00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:57,464
They show "aristocatic" bearing
when they're seen upon an airing

10
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,476
An "aristocatic" flair in
what they do and what they say

11
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:04,342
Aristocats are never found
in alleyways

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,579
Or hanging 'round the garbage cans
where common kitties play, oh, no

Naturellement

Marie, my little one...

18
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:39,405
you're going to be as beautiful
as your mother.

19
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:39,962
you're going to be as beautiful
as your mother.

20
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,064
Isn't she, Duchess?

21
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:49,673
Careful, Toulouse!

22
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:53,480
You're making it very difficult
for Edgar.

23
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:58,613
Whoa, Frou-Frou, whoa.
Steady, girl.

24
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,664
Thank you, Edgar.

25
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:09,360
Oh, of course, Frou-Frou.

26
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:12,370
I almost forgot.

27
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:15,601
Madame, uh, uh, may I take
your parcel, Madame?

28
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:17,870
It really is much too heavy
for you, Madame.

29
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:21,379
Now, tut tut, Edgar.
Don't fuss over me.

30
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:29,079
Berlioz, come back here. Haven't you
forgotten something, darling?

31
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:33,091
Thank you, Miss Frou-Frou, for
letting me ride on your back.

32
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,061
- You're quite welcome, young man.
- How was that, Mama?

33
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,893
Very good, darling.
That was very nice.

34
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:44,493
Come along, Duchess, kittens.
Come along.

35
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,973
Oh, and Edgar, I'm expecting
my attorney, Georges Hautecourt.

36
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,009
You remember him, of course.

37
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:53,477
Of course, Madame.

38
00:03:53,546 --> 00:03:56,242
How could anyone forget him?

39
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:09,420
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh

40
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,189
Oh!

41
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:19,904
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ta-rah-rah boom de...

42
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:24,636
Whoops! Oh, ho, ho. I'm not
as spry as I was when I was 80. Eh?

43
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,840
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh

44
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:35,552
Ah, good day, sir.
Madame is expecting you, sir.

45
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:37,612
Evening!
Evening, Edgar.

46
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,421
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh

47
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:44,122
Oh, another ringer, sir.
You never miss.

48
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:48,794
Come on, Edgar. The last one
up the stairs is a nincompoop.

49
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,268
Uh, uh, could we take
the elevator this time, sir?

50
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:54,101
Oh, oh, that birdcage?
Poppycock!

51
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:56,733
Elevators are for old people.
Whoops!

52
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:59,141
Uh, may I give you a hand, sir?

53
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:02,578
You haven't got an extra foot,
have you, Edgar?

54
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:06,880
That always makes me laugh, sir.
Yes. Ha, ha. Every time.

55
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:09,750
- Whoa, ah! Let go of my cane!
- Ooh, ah, careful, sir.

56
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:11,949
Oh, please.
l-l-I'm frightfully sorry, sir.

57
00:05:14,193 --> 00:05:16,753
Don't panic, Edgar.

58
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:19,855
Upward and onward.
Whee!

59
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:22,059
Am I going too fast
for you, Edgar?

60
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:24,159
Oh, please, sir, hold...

61
00:05:28,774 --> 00:05:31,902
There now, Duchess.
That's better.

62
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:35,378
We must both look our best
for Georges.

63
00:05:35,447 --> 00:05:39,178
He's our oldest and
dearest friend, you know.

64
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:44,218
Come in.

65
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,987
Announcing Monsieur...

66
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:53,026
Georges Hautecourt.

67
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:56,590
Oh, my goodness, Edgar,
I know Georges.

68
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:00,435
Adelaide, my, my dear.

69
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:04,671
So good to see you, Georges.

70
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:10,376
Ah, still the softest hands
in all of Paris, eh?

71
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:14,715
You're a shameless flatterer,
Georges.

72
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:21,051
Adelaide, that's, that's music!
It's from Carmen, isn't it?

73
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:24,186
That's right.
It was my favorite role.

74
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:26,424
Yes, yes!

75
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:30,366
It was the night of your grand premiere
that we first met, remember?

76
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:34,031
- Oh, indeed, I do.
- And how we celebrated your success.

77
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:36,870
Champagne.
Dancing the night away.

78
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:46,050
Oh, Georges!

79
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:03,694
Oh.

80
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:09,036
Oh, thank goodness.

81
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:11,804
Just in time.

82
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:17,406
Ah, Georges, we're just a pair
of sentimental old fools.

83
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:25,118
Now, Georges, do be serious.

84
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,559
I've asked you to come here on
a very important legal matter.

85
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:33,120
Uh! Oh!
Splendid, splendid!

86
00:07:33,198 --> 00:07:35,393
Who do you want me
to sue, eh?

87
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:38,527
Oh, come now, Georges.
I don't wish you to sue anyone.

88
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:40,765
I simply want
to make my will.

89
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,603
Will, eh?
Will. Will.

90
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:51,376
Now then, who are
the beneficiaries?

91
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,284
Well, as you know,
I have no living relatives...

92
00:07:55,354 --> 00:08:00,587
and naturally, I want my beloved cats
to be always well cared for.

93
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:05,119
And certainly no one can do this better
than my faithful servant, Edgar.

94
00:08:05,197 --> 00:08:06,630
Edgar?

95
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:10,895
Adelaide, you mean to say you're
leaving your vast fortune to Edgar?

96
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,029
Everything you possess?

97
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:17,542
Stocks and bonds? This, this mansion?
Your country chateau?

98
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:20,635
Art treasures? Jewels?
And, and...

99
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:24,012
Oh, no, no, Georges.
To my cats.

100
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,745
- To your cats?
- Cats!

101
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:31,051
Yes, Georges, I simply wish
to have the cats inherit first.

102
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:33,421
Then, at the end
of their life span...

103
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:36,484
my entire estate
will revert to Edgar.

104
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:40,464
Cats inherit first!
And I come after the cats.

105
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:45,595
l, me, after... No.
It's, it's not fair! Oh!

106
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:48,504
I mean... Ooh!
Each cat'll live about 12 years.

107
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:51,042
I can't wait...
And, and each cat has nine lives.

108
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,171
That's... Four times 12,
and multiply by nine times.

109
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:59,877
No, it's less than that. Well, anyway,
it's much longer than I'd ever live.

110
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:02,819
I'll be gone.

111
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:07,120
No. Oh, no.
They'll be gone.

112
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:09,126
I'll think of a way.

113
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:12,027
Why, there are a million
reasons why I should.

114
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,790
All of them dollars.

115
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:17,028
Millions.

116
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:20,936
Those cats have got to go!

117
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:26,167
- Wait for me. Wait for me.
- Me first. Me first.

118
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:29,476
Why should you be first?

119
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:32,073
Because I'm a lady,
that's why.

120
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:33,535
Ha-uh. You're not a lady.

121
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:34,502
Ha-uh. You're not a lady.

122
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:37,163
You're nothin' but a sister.

123
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,975
I'll show you
if I'm a lady or not.

124
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:50,479
- You're tickling.
- Get her, Berlioz, get her.

125
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:57,018
Fight fair, Marie.

126
00:09:57,092 --> 00:10:00,653
Females never fight fair.

127
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:03,698
Ah! Now that hurt.
Mama, Mama!

128
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:06,495
Marie, darling, Marie,
you must stop that.

129
00:10:06,568 --> 00:10:11,096
Th-This is really not ladylike.
And, Berlioz...

130
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:15,200
but such behavior is most unbecoming
to a lovely gentleman.

131
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:17,302
Well, she started it.

132
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:20,542
Ladies do not start fights...

133
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:23,049
but they can finish them.

134
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:25,882
Berlioz, now don't be rude.

135
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:28,718
We were just practicing
biting and clawing.

136
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,056
Aristocats do not practice
biting and clawing...

137
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:35,221
and things like that,
that's just horrible.

138
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:38,664
But someday we might meet
a tough alley cat.

139
00:10:44,105 --> 00:10:49,543
Now, that will do.
It's time we concerned ourselves
with self-improvement.

140
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:53,206
Now, you want to grow up to be lovely,
charming ladies and gentlemen.

141
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:56,409
Now, Toulouse you go and start
on with your painting.

142
00:10:56,484 --> 00:10:58,111
Yes, Mama.

143
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:04,652
Mama, may we watch Toulouse paint
before we start our music lesson?

144
00:11:04,726 --> 00:11:08,628
- Please?
- Well, yes, my love, but...

145
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:11,222
- Whoops.
-you must be very quiet.
- Uh-oh.

146
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:25,045
Uh-huh.

147
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:38,352
Yeah.

148
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:42,328
- It's Edgar.
- Yeah, old pickle puss Edgar!

149
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:47,301
Old pickle puss!
Now, now, Berlioz.

150
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:49,496
That is not kind.

151
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:52,199
You know Edgar is so fond
of all of us...

152
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:54,936
and takes very good care of us.

153
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,140
Rock-a-bye kitties
Bye-bye you go

154
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:03,873
La-la-la-la
And I'm in the dough

155
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:06,284
Oh, Edgar,
you sly old fox.

156
00:12:14,162 --> 00:12:16,323
Oops! Oh, dear.

157
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:19,094
A slip of the hand
and it's off to dreamland.

158
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:22,728
I say, that's not at all bad.
Slip of the hand, dreamland.

159
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:25,170
Now, let's leave Toulouse
to his painting.

160
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,843
Now, dear, you go to the piano.
Now, run along, both of you. Go ahead.

161
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:33,278
- Yes, Mama.
- Yes, Mama.

162
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:37,512
It's time to practice
your scales and your arpeggios.

163
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:39,678
Ouch!

164
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:58,168
I'm ready, maestro.

165
00:13:00,508 --> 00:13:03,739
Oh! Mama,
he did it again.

166
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,471
- Tattletale.
- Now, Berlioz.

167
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:09,608
Now, please, darling,
settle down...

168
00:13:09,684 --> 00:13:12,278
and play me
your pretty little song.

169
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:13,981
Yes, Mama.

170
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:18,682
Do, me, so
Do, do, so, me, do

171
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,663
Every truly cultured
music student knows

172
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:28,965
You must learn your scales
and your arpeggios

173
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:33,599
Bring the music ringing from
your chest and not your nose

174
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:38,169
While you sing your scales
and your arpeggios

175
00:13:39,748 --> 00:13:44,913
If you're faithful
to your daily practicing

176
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:49,946
You will find your progress
is encouraging

177
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:54,860
Do, me, so, me, do, me, so, me
Fa, la, so it goes

178
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:59,992
When you do your scales
and your arpeggios

179
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:01,933
Do, me, so, do...

180
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:16,273
Do, me, so
Do, do, so, me, do

181
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:18,615
Do, me, so
Do, do, so, me, do

182
00:14:18,686 --> 00:14:23,680
Though at first it seems
as though it doesn't show

183
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:28,457
Like a tree
ability will bloom and grow

184
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:34,435
If you're smart you'll learn
by heart what every artist knows

185
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:38,529
You must sing your scales
and your

186
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:44,272
Arpeggios

187
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,486
Ah, good evening,
my little ones.

188
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:13,303
Your favorite dish
prepared in a very special way.

189
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:16,138
It's creme de la creme
a la Edgar.

190
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:19,908
Sleep well. l, I mean,
eat, eat well, of course.

191
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:40,364
Good evening, Duchess.
Hello, kittens.

192
00:15:40,435 --> 00:15:42,699
- Hello, Roquefort!
- Hi, Roquefort!

193
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,762
Uh, good evening
Monsieur Roquefort.

194
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,776
Mmm. Something smells
awfully good.

195
00:15:49,844 --> 00:15:52,369
Mmm, what is
that appetizing smell?

196
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:55,382
It's creme de la creme
a la Edgar.

197
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,850
Oh, won't you join us,
Monsieur Roquefort?

198
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,650
Well, yes. l, I mean, well,
I don't mean to interrupt.

199
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:07,252
But... But it so happens
that I have a cracker with me.

200
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:09,592
Come on, Roquefort,
have some.

201
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:13,191
Oh, thank you.
Don't mind if I do.

202
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:15,395
Just a few dunks.

203
00:16:17,105 --> 00:16:19,733
Mmm. Ooh, very good.

204
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:21,741
My compliments
to the chef.

205
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:24,403
Mmm, this is yummy.

206
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:28,343
Mmm, delicious.

207
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:31,979
Double delicious.

208
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:35,648
This calls for another cracker.
I'll be right back.

209
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:51,395
So that's...

210
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:56,406
creme de la creme...

211
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,705
a la Edgar.

212
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:48,150
Lafayette.
Hey, Lafayette.

213
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,949
- Lafayette!
- Well, I'm right here.

214
00:18:52,023 --> 00:18:55,186
Listen.
Wheels approachin'.

215
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,388
Oh, Napoleon, we done bit
six tires today.

216
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:01,296
Chased four motorcars
and a bicycle and a scooter.

217
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:04,631
Hush your mouth!

218
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:07,296
It's a motorcycle.
Two cylinder.

219
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:09,306
Chain drive.

220
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:12,866
One squeaky wheel,
on the front, it sounds like.

221
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:17,404
Now, you go for the tires, and I'll go
right for the seat of the problem.

222
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:20,280
How come you always grab
the tender part for yourself?

223
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:24,247
'Cause I outrank you,
that's why.

224
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:27,587
Now, stop beatin' your gums
and sound the attack.

225
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:32,993
No, that's mess call.

226
00:19:33,064 --> 00:19:34,691
Made a mess of it, huh?

227
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:36,791
You can be replaced,
you know.

228
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:39,302
Okay, let's charge.

229
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,702
Wait a minute.
I'm the leader!

230
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:45,140
I'm the one that says
when we go.

231
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,111
Here we go.
Charge!

232
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:27,873
Nice doggie, nice doggie.
Heel, roll over, play dead.

233
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,514
Yeow!

234
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:38,186
This sure beats runnin',
Napoleon.

235
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:28,712
- Step on the gas, Napoleon.
- I got her wide open.

236
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:34,409
Ow!

237
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,790
Yeow!

238
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:22,157
Oh! Oh, where am I?

239
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,625
I'm not at home at all.

240
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:28,511
Children, where are you?
Answer me.

241
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:29,170
Children, where are you?
Answer me.

242
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:33,045
Berlioz, Toulouse, Marie,
where are you?

243
00:22:33,116 --> 00:22:35,209
Here I am, Mama.

244
00:22:36,953 --> 00:22:40,354
Marie, darling.
Ar-Are you all right?

245
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:44,553
Uh, I guess I had a nightmare
and fell out of bed.

246
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:47,494
Now, Marie darling,
n-now, now don't be frightened.

247
00:22:47,563 --> 00:22:51,431
- Mama! Mama!
- That's Berlioz!

248
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:53,833
Over here, darling Berlioz.
Here we are.

249
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:57,070
A-And don't worry. Everything
is going to be all right.

250
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,904
I'm comin', Mama.

251
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:03,605
Gee, I'm cold and I'm wet.

252
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,237
Mama?

253
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:07,145
Mama?

254
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:09,309
Mama!

255
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:12,780
Oh, darling.

256
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:15,722
That's only a little frog,
my love.

257
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:18,522
But he had a mouth
like a "hippolotamus."

258
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:24,796
Oh, what's so funny?

259
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:27,802
Now, now, darling... Darlings,
now you just stay here...

260
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,395
and I go and I look
for Toulouse.

261
00:23:30,473 --> 00:23:33,931
Toulouse!
Toulouse, where are you?

262
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,877
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!

263
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:40,074
- Toulouse!
- Hey.

264
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:42,583
What's all the yellin' about, huh?

265
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:44,210
Why didn't you answer?

266
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:48,155
Mama, he's been here
all the time.

267
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,522
Oh, thank goodness.
Oh.

268
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,527
A-Are you all right?

269
00:23:52,595 --> 00:23:55,325
I was having
a funny dream.

270
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:57,332
Edgar was in it.

271
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,496
And we were all riding
and bouncing along...

272
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:07,339
Frogs? Uh-oh, it wasn't a dream.
Edgar did this to us.

273
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,139
Edgar?

274
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:13,911
Oh, darling, why, that's...
Why, that's ridiculous!

275
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:16,747
Yeah. Maybe you fell
on your head, Toulouse.

276
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:23,091
Mama, I'm afraid.
I wanna go home.

277
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,528
Now, now, my darling, now don't
be frightened. You'll see...

278
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:31,431
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Now, let's
get into the basket, all of us.

279
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,934
What's gonna happen to us?

280
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:37,564
Why, darlings, l,
I just don't know.

281
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,165
It does look hopeless,
doesn't it?

282
00:24:40,243 --> 00:24:43,770
I wish we were home with Madame
right now.

283
00:24:43,846 --> 00:24:47,976
Oh, poor Madame.

284
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,349
She'll be so worried
when she finds us gone.

285
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:58,459
Duchess? Kittens?

286
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:03,226
Oh, my gracious! I had the most
horrible dream about them.

287
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,536
Thank goodness
it was only a dream.

288
00:25:08,604 --> 00:25:10,799
Oh, dear,
what a terrible night.

289
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:17,141
Now, now, my darlings.
Don't be frightened.

290
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:19,738
The storm will soon pass.

291
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,814
Oh! Oh, no!
They're gone!

292
00:25:25,888 --> 00:25:28,186
Duchess! Kittens!

293
00:25:28,257 --> 00:25:30,782
Duchess, where are you?

294
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,091
They're gone!
They're gone!

295
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:39,897
Duchess? Kittens? Gone?
Why, that's terrible!

296
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:42,233
But where? Why?

297
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:46,742
Good heavens! Anything could happen
to them on a night like this!

298
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:49,710
Get, get washed down
a storm drain.

299
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:52,077
Struck by lightning.

300
00:25:52,148 --> 00:25:54,673
Oh, they'll need help.

301
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,116
I've just got
to find them.

302
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:03,015
Duchess! Kittens!

303
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:13,132
Duchess!

304
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:15,762
Kittens!

305
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:18,136
Kittens!

306
00:26:33,162 --> 00:26:36,427
I like a chee-chee-chee-chee-rony
like they make at home

307
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:39,957
Or a healthy fish
with a big backbone

308
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:42,061
I'm Abraham Delacey

309
00:26:43,572 --> 00:26:45,301
Giuseppe Casey

310
00:26:47,043 --> 00:26:50,171
Thomas O'Malley

311
00:26:50,246 --> 00:26:52,476
O'Malley the alley cat

312
00:26:52,548 --> 00:26:55,676
I've got that wanderlust

313
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:57,776
Gotta walk the scene

314
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:02,315
Gotta kick up
highway dust

315
00:27:02,391 --> 00:27:05,588
Feel the grass
that's green

316
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:08,562
Gotta strut
them city streets

317
00:27:08,631 --> 00:27:11,828
Showin' off my eclat

318
00:27:11,968 --> 00:27:13,731
Yeah

319
00:27:13,803 --> 00:27:16,670
Tellin' my friends
of the social elite

320
00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:19,765
Or some cute cat
I happen to meet

321
00:27:19,842 --> 00:27:21,867
That I'm

322
00:27:23,746 --> 00:27:27,011
Abraham Delacey
Giuseppe Casey

Thomas O'Malley

324
00:27:30,086 --> 00:27:32,816
O'Malley the alley cat

325
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:36,387
Oh, why, monsieur...

326
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:38,859
your name seems to cover
all of Europe.

327
00:27:38,928 --> 00:27:42,523
Well, of course.
I'm the only cat of my kind.

328
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:46,697
I'm king of the highway

329
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:49,670
Prince of the boulevard

330
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,039
Duke of the avant-garde

331
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,772
The world
is my backyard

332
00:27:56,846 --> 00:27:59,781
So if you're goin'
my way

333
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:03,341
That's the road
you wanna seek

334
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,786
Calcutta to Rome
or home sweet home

335
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:10,883
In Paris
magnifique you all

336
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:14,523
Oh, boy! An alley cat!

337
00:28:14,597 --> 00:28:16,656
Shh, shh. Listen.

338
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:20,168
I only got myself

339
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:23,672
And this big old world

340
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:26,708
But I sip that cup
of life

341
00:28:26,776 --> 00:28:30,405
With my fingers curled

342
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:33,209
I don't worry
what road to take

343
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:36,547
I don't have to think
of that

344
00:28:38,187 --> 00:28:41,179
Whatever I take
is the road I make

345
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:44,226
It's the road of life
Make no mistake

346
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:46,352
For me

347
00:28:47,463 --> 00:28:49,897
Yeah
Abraham Delacey

348
00:28:49,965 --> 00:28:53,366
Giuseppe Casey
Thomas O'Malley

349
00:28:54,904 --> 00:28:57,566
O'Malley the alley cat

350
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:03,904
That's right
And I'm very proud of that

351
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:05,913
Yeah

352
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:13,080
Bravo! Very good.
You are a great talent.

353
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:17,251
Well, thank you.
And what might your name be?

354
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:19,260
My name is Duchess.

355
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:21,762
Duchess.

356
00:29:21,831 --> 00:29:25,164
Beautiful.
Love it.

357
00:29:25,234 --> 00:29:28,931
And those eyes.
Ooh.

358
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:32,940
Why, your eyes are like
sapphires sparkling so bright.

359
00:29:33,008 --> 00:29:36,910
They make the morning
radiant and light.

360
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:41,245
- How romantic.
- Sissy stuff.

361
00:29:41,317 --> 00:29:44,252
Oh, c'est tres jolie,
monsieur.

362
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,983
Very poetic.
But it is not quite Shakespeare.

363
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:51,254
'Course not.
That's pure O'Malley, baby.

364
00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:54,592
Right off the cuff. Yeah.
I got a million of'em.

365
00:29:54,663 --> 00:29:56,631
Oh, no more, please.

366
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:59,031
I am really in
a great deal of trouble.

367
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:01,296
Trouble?

368
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,534
Helping beautiful dame...
uh, uh, damsels in distress
is my specialty.

369
00:30:05,608 --> 00:30:08,577
Now, what's the hang-up,
your ladyship?

370
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:11,545
Well, it is most important
that I get back to Paris.

371
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:16,074
So, if you would be just
so kind and show me the way.

372
00:30:16,152 --> 00:30:19,883
Show you the way?
Perish the thought!

373
00:30:19,955 --> 00:30:23,356
We shall fly to Paris
on a magic carpet...

374
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:25,222
side by side...

375
00:30:25,294 --> 00:30:29,060
with the stars
as our guide...

376
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:31,065
just we two.

377
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,931
Oh, that would
be wonderful.

378
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:37,905
Three? Four?

379
00:30:37,973 --> 00:30:39,907
Five?

380
00:30:39,975 --> 00:30:43,069
Oh, yes, Monsieur O'Malley.
These are my children.

381
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:44,737
Oh, how sweet.

382
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:47,373
Do you really have
a magic carpet?

383
00:30:47,449 --> 00:30:51,579
- And are we really gonna ride on it?
- Now, now, Marie.

384
00:30:51,654 --> 00:30:56,921
Mama, do I have sparkling
sapphire eyes that dazzle, too?

385
00:30:56,992 --> 00:30:59,153
Ooh, did I say that?

386
00:30:59,228 --> 00:31:01,594
Yes, right off your cuff.

387
00:31:01,664 --> 00:31:04,599
And you said we're gonna ride
on a magic carpet.

388
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:07,659
Well, now, uh, what I meant...
You see, l...

389
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:11,570
No poetry to cover this
situation, Monsieur O'Malley?

390
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,268
Well, what I had in mind was
a kind of a sports model, baby.

391
00:31:14,343 --> 00:31:18,609
- You know, one of those...
- Uh, perhaps a, a magic carpet
built for two?

392
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:21,616
I wouldn't take up much room.

393
00:31:23,152 --> 00:31:25,985
I understand perfectly,
Monsieur O'Malley.

394
00:31:26,055 --> 00:31:29,115
Well, come along, darlings.

395
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:36,464
I'm a tough alley cat, too.

396
00:31:36,532 --> 00:31:41,299
Hey, there, you're comin' on.
I'll bet you're a real tiger
in your neighborhood.

397
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,635
Yeah. That's 'cause I practice
all the time.

398
00:31:44,707 --> 00:31:47,301
Now, now, Toulouse, Toulouse,
come along, dear.

399
00:31:47,376 --> 00:31:49,742
Yes, Mama.

400
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:52,303
See ya around, Tiger!

401
00:31:57,186 --> 00:32:00,781
Ha-ha. Now, that's
quite a family.

402
00:32:00,856 --> 00:32:05,350
And come to think of it, O'Malley,
you're not a cat, you're a rat.

403
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:08,225
Right? Right.

404
00:32:08,297 --> 00:32:10,561
Hey! Hey, hold up, there!

405
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:12,567
Yes, Monsieur O'Malley?

406
00:32:12,635 --> 00:32:16,366
Now, look, kids,
if I said magic carpet...

407
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:18,565
magic carpet
it's gonna be.

408
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:22,509
And it's gonna stop
for passengers...

409
00:32:22,578 --> 00:32:24,170
right...

410
00:32:25,948 --> 00:32:27,848
here.

411
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:30,441
Oh, boy!
We're gonna fly after all.

412
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,319
Ah, another flight into
the fantasy, Monsieur O'Malley?

413
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,226
No, no, no, baby!

414
00:32:37,226 --> 00:32:38,124
No, no, no, baby!

415
00:32:38,193 --> 00:32:43,426
Now, you just hide over there and you
leave the rest to J. Thomas O'Malley.

416
00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:46,263
- Quick, Mama, get in here.
- But, but, children...

417
00:32:46,335 --> 00:32:48,701
Hurry up, Mama. Hurry.

418
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:57,035
One magic carpet comin' up.

419
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:59,376
That's a magic carpet?

420
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:15,958
Stupid cat!
Brainless lunatic!

421
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:22,270
All right, step lively.
All aboard for Paris.

422
00:33:22,338 --> 00:33:24,863
Why, Mr. O'Malley,
you could have lost your life.

423
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:29,095
So, I've got a few to spare.
Nothin'.

424
00:33:29,228 --> 00:33:31,025
How can we ever thank you?

425
00:33:31,097 --> 00:33:34,032
My pleasure entirely.

426
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:38,098
Aloha. Auf Wiedersehen.

427
00:33:38,171 --> 00:33:41,436
Bon soir. Sayonara.

428
00:33:41,507 --> 00:33:43,873
And all those
good-bye things, baby.

429
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:46,639
Sayonara, Mister... Oh!

430
00:33:46,713 --> 00:33:50,149
- Mama!
- Marie! Marie!

431
00:33:55,388 --> 00:33:58,653
- Oh, Marie, are you all right?
- Yes, Mama.

432
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:00,659
Haven't we met before?

433
00:34:00,727 --> 00:34:04,163
Oh, and I'm so very glad we did.

434
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,859
Thank you, Mr. O'Malley,
for saving my life.

435
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:10,368
No trouble at all,
little princess.

436
00:34:10,436 --> 00:34:14,167
And when we get to Paris, I'll
show you the time of your life.

437
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,334
Oh, I'm so sorry, but...

438
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,344
Well, we just couldn't.

439
00:34:19,412 --> 00:34:23,678
You see, my mistress will be
so worried about us.

440
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,780
Well, humans don't really worry
too much about their pets.

441
00:34:27,913 --> 00:34:31,610
Oh, no.
You just don't understand.

442
00:34:31,684 --> 00:34:34,710
She loves us very much.

443
00:34:34,787 --> 00:34:38,689
Poor Madame,
in that big mansion...

444
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:41,591
all alone.

445
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:46,120
In all our days,
in tender ways...

446
00:34:46,198 --> 00:34:48,564
her love for us was shown.

447
00:34:50,503 --> 00:34:53,199
And so, you see...

448
00:34:53,272 --> 00:34:56,070
we can't leave her alone.

449
00:34:58,844 --> 00:35:01,369
She'd always say that...

450
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:04,610
we're the greatest treasure
she could own...

451
00:35:08,154 --> 00:35:12,113
because with us
she never felt alone.

452
00:35:14,894 --> 00:35:18,091
Oh, Roquefort, I've been
so worried about you.

453
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:20,155
Did you have any luck
at all?

454
00:35:20,232 --> 00:35:22,666
Not a sign of them,
Frou-Frou.

455
00:35:22,735 --> 00:35:24,930
And I've searched
all night.

456
00:35:25,004 --> 00:35:29,668
I know, and poor Madame
didn't sleep a wink either.

457
00:35:29,742 --> 00:35:33,508
Oh, it's a sad day
for all of us.

458
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:44,547
Morning, Frou-Frou,
my pretty steed. Ho-hmm.

459
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:48,389
Can you keep a secret? Hmm?
Of course you can.

460
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:52,622
I've some news
straight from the horse's mouth.

461
00:35:52,698 --> 00:35:56,065
If you'll pardon the expression,
of course. Ha.

462
00:35:56,135 --> 00:35:58,968
Look, Frou-Frou,
I've made the headlines.

463
00:35:59,038 --> 00:36:04,066
" Mysterious Catnapper
Abducts Family of Cats"

464
00:36:04,143 --> 00:36:08,944
- Well, aren't you proud of me?
- So, he's the catnapper!

465
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:12,006
The police said it was
a professional, masterful job.

466
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:13,813
The work of a genius.

467
00:36:13,886 --> 00:36:15,945
Not bad, eh,
Frou-Frou old girl?

468
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:23,259
Oh, they won't find a clue to
implicate me. Not one single clue.

469
00:36:24,196 --> 00:36:27,927
Why, I'll, I'll,
I'll eat my hat if they...

470
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,468
My hat!
My umbrella!

471
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:32,663
Oh, oh gracious!

472
00:36:32,738 --> 00:36:35,798
l, I've got to get
those things back tonight.

473
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:39,174
But... Ooh, you...

474
00:36:39,245 --> 00:36:42,476
Why, that sneaky, crooked...

475
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:44,880
no good butler of...

476
00:36:55,194 --> 00:36:59,028
- Anyone for breakfast?
- What breakfast?
- Where is it?

477
00:36:59,098 --> 00:37:01,032
Right under
that magic carpet.

478
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,467
But now we have to cook up
a little spell.

479
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:07,028
You know.
You ready?

480
00:37:07,106 --> 00:37:10,098
All right. First,
to make the magic begin...

481
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:12,371
you wiggle your nose.

482
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:15,474
And tickle your chin.

483
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:18,676
Now, you close your eyes...

484
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:21,845
and cross your heart.

485
00:37:21,921 --> 00:37:25,880
Then presto!
Breakfast a la carte.

486
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:28,722
- Hurray!
- We did it!
- Look, Mama, look.

487
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:35,460
Why, Mr. O'Malley,
you are amazing!

488
00:37:35,534 --> 00:37:38,628
True. True.

489
00:37:47,713 --> 00:37:51,308
Thieves! You robbers!
Mangy tramps!

490
00:37:51,383 --> 00:37:54,011
Take that and that!

491
00:37:58,891 --> 00:38:03,851
Oh! Oh, what a horrible,
horrible human.

492
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:05,863
Well, some humans
are like that, Duchess.

493
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:07,990
I've learned to live with it.

494
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:10,729
I'll show him.
Meow!

495
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:14,739
Hey, cool it, you little tiger.
That guy's dynamite.

496
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:16,741
But he called us tramps.

497
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:20,040
Oh, I'll be so glad
when we get back home.

498
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:23,411
Well, that's a long way off
so we better get movin'.

499
00:38:29,488 --> 00:38:33,049
Gee whiz!
Look at that bridge!

500
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:36,652
- Come on, let's play train.
- Now, be careful, children.

501
00:38:36,729 --> 00:38:39,254
Marie's the caboose.
All aboard!

502
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:44,134
Whoo! Whoo!

503
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:47,370
Whoo! Whoo!

504
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:50,465
Clickety, clickety,
clickety, clickety.

505
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,601
Whoo! Whoo!

506
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,614
- Oh, no!
- All right, now, don't panic.

507
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:58,673
Down underneath here.

508
00:39:12,531 --> 00:39:14,465
Mama!

509
00:39:14,533 --> 00:39:17,127
Marie! Oh, Marie!

510
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:19,295
Keep your head up, Marie.
Here I come.

511
00:39:37,423 --> 00:39:39,857
Thomas! Thomas, up here.

512
00:39:50,102 --> 00:39:53,162
Gee, Marie, why'd you have
to fall off the bridge?

513
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:59,904
Thomas! Oh, Thomas!
Take care!

514
00:39:59,978 --> 00:40:03,311
I'm all right, honey. Don't worry.
I'll see ya downstream.

515
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:16,951
What beautiful countryside,
Abigail.

516
00:40:17,029 --> 00:40:19,725
Oh, so much like
our own dear England.

517
00:40:19,798 --> 00:40:22,392
Oh, indeed yes.

518
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:26,234
Amelia, if I walk much further,
I'll get flat feet.

519
00:40:26,305 --> 00:40:30,366
Abigail, we were born
with flat feet.

520
00:40:34,213 --> 00:40:36,704
I say,
look over there.

521
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:38,977
Oh! Oh, how unusual.

522
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:42,020
Well, fancy that.
A cat learning how to swim.

523
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:44,487
And he's going about it
all the wrong way.

524
00:40:44,556 --> 00:40:47,923
Quite.
We must correct him.

525
00:40:47,993 --> 00:40:50,518
Sir! Sir!

526
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:52,826
You are most fortunate
we happened along.

527
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:54,832
Yes, we're here
to help you.

528
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,859
No, no. Back off, girls.
I'm doin' fine.

529
00:40:58,937 --> 00:41:02,930
First, you must gain self-confidence
by striking out on your own.

530
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:06,102
Go away.
I'm tryin' to get to shore.

531
00:41:06,178 --> 00:41:09,841
You will never learn to swim properly
with that willow branch in your mouth.

532
00:41:09,915 --> 00:41:11,507
Indeed not!

533
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:14,211
Snip, snip.
Here we go.

534
00:41:14,286 --> 00:41:16,277
Don't do that!

535
00:41:17,956 --> 00:41:20,424
You're doing splendidly!

536
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:24,394
And don't worry about form.
It will come later.

537
00:41:24,463 --> 00:41:27,296
Ooh, he takes to water
like a fish, doesn't he?

538
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:30,358
A very enthusiastic pupil.

539
00:41:33,472 --> 00:41:36,660
No. Now, this is no time
for fun and games.

540
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:45,463
Gracious, Amelia.
You don't suppose...

541
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:48,265
Oh, yes! Yes, I do!
Bottoms up!

542
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,871
- Deeper!
- Deeper!

543
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:00,443
Look, Ma, there he is.

544
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:04,180
You really did quite well
for a beginner.

545
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:08,748
Oh, Thomas!
Thank goodness you're safe.

546
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:12,226
- Keep practicing!
- And toodlely pip.

547
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:16,023
Can I help you,
Mr. O'Malley, huh?

548
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:18,897
Help? I've had all the help
I can take.

549
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:23,406
Oh, mademoiselles, thank you so
much for helping Mr. O'Malley.

550
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,905
Of course, my dear.
But first, introductions.

551
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,207
Yes. We British like
to keep things proper.

552
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:35,378
Now, now, I am Amelia Gabble,
and this is my sister...

553
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,943
- Uh, Miss Abigail Gabble.
- We're twin sisters.

554
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:40,819
- You might say we're related.
- Oh, silly thing.

555
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:45,225
How nice.
I never would have guessed.

556
00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:48,662
- Look, they got rubber feet.
- Yeah!

557
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:52,667
- We're on holiday.
- For a walking tour of France.

558
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,603
- Uh, swimming some of the way.
- On water, of course.

559
00:42:55,672 --> 00:42:57,833
Of course.

560
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,344
Uh, Thomas, this is Amelia
and Abigail Gabble.

561
00:43:01,411 --> 00:43:05,074
Yeah, honey. Get those two
web-footed lifeguards out of here.

562
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:07,412
Now, now, Thomas.

563
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:10,544
Okay, okay, baby.
Hiya, chicks.

564
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:12,755
Oh.

565
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:20,363
We're not chickens.
We're geese.

566
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:24,423
No! I thought
you were swans.

567
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,595
Ooh! Ooh! Flatterer!

568
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:31,937
Your husband is very charming
and very handsome.

569
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,738
Well, ha, uh...

570
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,142
You see, l-I'm not exactly
her husband.

571
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:40,149
Exactly? You either are
or you're not.

572
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:43,380
All right.
I'm not.

573
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:46,354
- Oh?
- Oh? Hmm.

574
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,891
- He's scandalous.
- He's nothing but a cad.

575
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:52,190
- Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate.
- A roue.

576
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:55,493
- Mmm, his eyes are too close together.
- They're shifty, too.

577
00:43:55,565 --> 00:43:59,831
- And look at his crooked smile.
- His chin is very weak, too.

578
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:04,237
Obviously a philanderer who trifles
with unsuspecting women's hearts.

579
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:06,741
How romantic.

580
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,372
Please.
Please let me explain.

581
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:15,384
Thomas is a dear friend of ours.
He's just helping us to get to...

582
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:19,252
Come on, Duchess, come on.
Let's get out of here.

583
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:23,759
Well, girls, see ya around.
We're on our way to Paris.

584
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,263
Ooh, how nice.
We're going to Paris ourselves.

585
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:29,195
Why don't you join us?

586
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,530
I think that's
a splendid idea.

587
00:44:31,601 --> 00:44:33,535
Oh, no.

588
00:44:33,603 --> 00:44:37,061
Now, uh,
you stand here, dear.

589
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,541
And, uh, let's see,
uh, you take this position.

590
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:43,408
- Uh, Duchess, you will do nicely here.
- Yes, very good.

591
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,711
And, and you, dear,
you take this place.

592
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:48,910
Oh, now that leaves
Mr. O'Malley.

593
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:51,215
Oh, we can't leave him,
can we?

594
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:57,489
Mr. O'Malley, I think
you should be the rear end.

595
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:01,122
Ready, everyone?
Now, think goose.

596
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,224
Forward march.

597
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:13,473
Mama, do we have to waddle
like they do?

598
00:45:13,543 --> 00:45:15,807
Yes, dear.
Think goose.

599
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:22,108
When we get to Paris,
you must meet Uncle Waldo.

600
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:24,841
- Waldo?
- Yes, he's our uncle.

601
00:45:24,974 --> 00:45:27,909
We are to meet Uncle Waldo
at Le Petit Cafe.

602
00:45:27,977 --> 00:45:32,243
Le Petit Cafe? Oh, that's
that famous restaurant.

603
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:34,374
Ah! C'est magnifique.

604
00:45:41,724 --> 00:45:44,591
Oh, he bit my finger!

605
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,856
Get out! Go! Go!
Get out! Scram!

606
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:51,591
Good riddance!

607
00:46:01,778 --> 00:46:04,440
Why, why, it's Uncle Waldo!

608
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:06,573
Uncle Waldo!

609
00:46:06,649 --> 00:46:09,709
Abigail! Amelia!

610
00:46:09,786 --> 00:46:11,913
My two favorite "nooses."

611
00:46:11,988 --> 00:46:16,584
Uncle Waldo. Tsk, tsk. l, I do
believe you've been drinking.

612
00:46:16,659 --> 00:46:20,618
Oh, dear! What happened
to your lovely tail feathers?

613
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:24,326
Girls, it's outrageous.

614
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,995
Why, you won't believe
what they tried to do...

615
00:46:28,071 --> 00:46:31,598
to your poor old
Uncle Waldo.

616
00:46:31,674 --> 00:46:34,268
Look! Look at this!

617
00:46:34,344 --> 00:46:38,610
" Prime Country Goose
A la Provencale.

618
00:46:38,681 --> 00:46:40,945
Stuffed with chestnuts"?

619
00:46:41,017 --> 00:46:46,080
"And basted
in white wine."

620
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:50,422
Basted? He's been
marinated in it.

621
00:46:50,493 --> 00:46:52,120
Dreadful!

622
00:46:52,195 --> 00:46:56,029
Being British,
I would have preferred sherry.

623
00:46:58,434 --> 00:47:00,766
Sherry! Sherry.

624
00:47:00,837 --> 00:47:02,930
Oh-oh, oh, oh!

625
00:47:03,006 --> 00:47:05,770
Oh, Uncle Waldo,
you're just too much.

626
00:47:05,842 --> 00:47:07,935
You mean,
he's had too much.

627
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:11,374
- Uh, Abigail, Abigail.
- Yes, yes.

628
00:47:11,447 --> 00:47:14,109
We best get
Uncle Waldo to bed.

629
00:47:14,184 --> 00:47:16,118
Ah, I say there now.

630
00:47:16,186 --> 00:47:19,622
What's all the whis-whispering
about, huh?

631
00:47:19,689 --> 00:47:21,657
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

632
00:47:21,724 --> 00:47:24,158
Now, now, now, now, girls.
Girls!

633
00:47:24,227 --> 00:47:26,821
Don't shush
your old Uncle Waldo.

634
00:47:26,896 --> 00:47:30,593
Why, you'll, you'll wake up
the whole neighborhood.

635
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:32,259
- Shh.
- Whoopee!

636
00:47:32,335 --> 00:47:34,633
- Shh.
- No.
- Neighborhood.

637
00:47:34,704 --> 00:47:38,231
- Oh, come along, Uncle Waldo.
- Oh, yes, I think we'd better be going.

638
00:47:38,308 --> 00:47:40,799
Oh, right-o, girls.

639
00:47:40,877 --> 00:47:44,813
Birds of a feather must
"hic" together.

640
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:48,009
That's stick together.

641
00:47:48,084 --> 00:47:49,915
I'll say!

642
00:47:52,155 --> 00:47:54,385
- Girls! Girls!
- Shoo, shoo, shoo.

643
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:04,789
You know somethin'?
I like Uncle Waldo.

644
00:48:05,768 --> 00:48:09,067
Especially when
he's marinated.

645
00:48:12,437 --> 00:48:14,166
Frou-Frou,
here comes Edgar.

646
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:16,264
Hurry, Roquefort,
hop aboard the motorcycle.

647
00:48:16,341 --> 00:48:19,367
And for goodness sakes,
do be careful!

648
00:48:24,716 --> 00:48:28,311
Frou-Frou, tonight operation
catnapper will be completed.

649
00:48:28,387 --> 00:48:30,719
Wish me luck.
Fisherman's luck.

650
00:48:39,064 --> 00:48:41,055
Bye, Frou-Frou.
Ooh!

651
00:50:00,212 --> 00:50:03,409
Lafayette!
Lafayette, listen.

652
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:09,318
Oh, shucks, Napoleon. That ain't
nothing' but a little ol' cricket bug.

653
00:50:09,388 --> 00:50:12,152
It's squeaky shoes approachin'.

654
00:50:12,224 --> 00:50:14,818
Oh, cricket bugs
don't wear shoes.

655
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:17,157
Hush your mouth!

656
00:50:17,229 --> 00:50:20,665
Let's see.
They're oxford shoes...

657
00:50:20,732 --> 00:50:23,667
size nine and a half.

658
00:50:23,735 --> 00:50:26,704
Hole in the left sole,
it sounds like.

659
00:50:26,772 --> 00:50:30,606
- What color are they?
- Why, they're black...
Ah, now how would I know that?

660
00:50:33,412 --> 00:50:36,347
Hey, now the squeakin'
has stopped.

661
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,509
I still say it was
a little ol' cricket bug.

662
00:50:39,584 --> 00:50:41,449
I'm the leader.

663
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,456
I'll decide what it was.

664
00:50:45,524 --> 00:50:47,458
It was a little
ol' cricket bug.

665
00:50:47,526 --> 00:50:51,360
I'll see you in the mornin',
Napoleon.

666
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:22,188
That's my hat!
I'm the leader!

667
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:26,663
Well, shoot fire! Don't get sore
at me. I ain't done nothin'.

668
00:52:11,977 --> 00:52:14,912
Ooh, oh, hey.

669
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,948
Ooh!

670
00:52:27,225 --> 00:52:29,557
Mmm, that feels good,
Lafayette.

671
00:52:29,628 --> 00:52:32,062
That's all right.

672
00:52:38,804 --> 00:52:40,795
A little lower
and faster there.

673
00:52:40,872 --> 00:52:45,536
I'm scratchin' as fast
as I can.

674
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:49,011
Right there! That's good!
Oh, ooh, ooh!

675
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,014
Ooh!

676
00:53:19,644 --> 00:53:22,613
Mmm, it's so warm and...

677
00:53:22,681 --> 00:53:26,173
mmm, cozy.

678
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:47,294
Wh-Wh-What's goin' on? Lafayette,
what in tar nation are you tryin' to do?

679
00:53:47,372 --> 00:53:50,136
Aw, I get blamed
for everything.

680
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:53,575
Wait a minute!
Where's my hat? Where...

681
00:53:53,645 --> 00:53:56,409
And somebody stole
my bumbershoot.

682
00:53:56,481 --> 00:53:59,041
Well, where's
my beddie-bye basket?

683
00:53:59,117 --> 00:54:03,781
And whoever it is,
is gonna get it and get it good.

684
00:54:03,855 --> 00:54:06,153
This time,
I get the tender part.

685
00:54:06,224 --> 00:54:09,455
Hush your mouth!
Now, come on.

686
00:54:20,505 --> 00:54:24,498
Hey, N-Napoleon,
oh, it's them shoes again!

687
00:54:24,576 --> 00:54:27,511
Yeah, yeah, I hear' em.

688
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:31,015
Napoleon, I'm plumb
goose-pimply scared.

689
00:54:31,082 --> 00:54:34,916
Now, this is no time
to turn chicken.

690
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:47,098
I got a feelin' this case
is gonna bust wide open.

691
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:53,863
Ah, d-d-d-did, did, did,
did you see him?

692
00:54:53,939 --> 00:54:56,874
No, no. He sneaked up
behind me and tailgated me.

693
00:54:56,942 --> 00:55:00,708
- Well, he didn't hurt me.
He hit me on the head.
- Shh, shh.

694
00:55:00,779 --> 00:55:02,804
Listen.

695
00:55:02,881 --> 00:55:06,214
Sounds like a one-wheeled,
oh...

696
00:55:06,284 --> 00:55:10,311
- A one-wheeled what?
- You're not gonna believe this...

697
00:55:10,388 --> 00:55:13,357
but it's a one-wheeled
haystack.

698
00:55:13,425 --> 00:55:15,893
Hey! There it goes!
Come on, after it!

699
00:55:20,966 --> 00:55:23,230
- I got him, I got him, I got him!
- Ouch! That's me!

700
00:55:23,301 --> 00:55:24,666
Oh, wow.

701
00:55:24,736 --> 00:55:27,569
Oh, get him, get him,
get him, get him!

702
00:55:33,645 --> 00:55:38,514
Well, c'est la guerre, Napoleon.
I guess you can't win 'em all.

703
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:42,451
Ow! Ohh, ohh, ohh!
Criminently!

704
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:05,504
Thomas, Madame will be so worried.
Are you sure we can't get home tonight?

705
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,014
Mama, I'm tired.

706
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:10,415
Me, too!
And my feet hurt.

707
00:56:10,485 --> 00:56:15,422
Look, baby, it's late,
and the kids are bushed.

708
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:18,015
I'll bet we walked
a hundred miles!

709
00:56:18,093 --> 00:56:20,857
I'll bet it's more
than a thousand!

710
00:56:20,929 --> 00:56:23,227
Now, now, darlings,
cheer up.

711
00:56:23,298 --> 00:56:26,529
Mr. O'Malley knows a place
where we can stay tonight.

712
00:56:26,601 --> 00:56:30,128
How much farther is it,
Mr. O'Malley?

713
00:56:30,205 --> 00:56:35,734
Keep your whiskers up, tiger.
It's just beyond that next chimney pot.

714
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:39,871
Well, there it is.
My own penthouse pad.

715
00:56:39,948 --> 00:56:44,408
It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's
peaceful and quiet. And you'll...

716
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,821
Oh! Oh, no!

717
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:52,121
Sounds like Scat Cat
and his gang have dropped by.

718
00:56:52,193 --> 00:56:54,388
Oh, friends of yours?

719
00:56:54,462 --> 00:56:58,694
Uh-huh, yeah. They're old buddies.
And they're, they're real swingers.

720
00:56:58,767 --> 00:57:01,361
Swingers?
What is a swinger?

721
00:57:01,436 --> 00:57:04,303
You know, uh, not exactly
your type, Duchess.

722
00:57:04,372 --> 00:57:07,466
And, uh, maybe we'd better find
another place. Huh?

723
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:12,343
Oh, no, no, no. I would like to see
your pad, and meet your Scat Cat.

724
00:57:12,413 --> 00:57:15,143
Well, okay.

725
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:21,451
Hey, Scat Cat, blow some
of that sweet stuff my way.

726
00:57:25,527 --> 00:57:29,896
Well, lookie here! Big Man O'Malley
is back in his alley.

727
00:57:29,964 --> 00:57:33,229
Swing on down here, daddy!

728
00:57:33,301 --> 00:57:37,067
Lay some skin on me, Scat Cat.
Yeah!

729
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,798
Welcome home, O'Malley.

730
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:45,403
Duchess, this is
the greatest cat of'em all.

731
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,643
Oh, I'm delighted to meet you,
Monsieur Scats Cat.

732
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:51,480
Likewise, Duchess.

733
00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:53,521
You're too much.

734
00:57:53,588 --> 00:57:56,785
Oh, ho-ho,
you are charming.

735
00:57:56,858 --> 00:57:59,224
And your music is so...

736
00:57:59,294 --> 00:58:02,923
so different,
ah, so exciting.

737
00:58:02,997 --> 00:58:06,330
It isn't Beethoven, Mama,
but it sure bounces.

738
00:58:07,769 --> 00:58:11,671
Say! This kitten cat
knows where it's at.

739
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:16,811
- Knows where what's at?
- Well, little lady,
let me elucidate here.

740
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:17,277
- Knows where what's at?
- Well, little lady,
let me elucidate here.

741
00:58:18,246 --> 00:58:20,714
Everybody wants to be a cat

742
00:58:20,782 --> 00:58:24,616
Because a cat's the only cat
who knows where it's at

743
00:58:24,686 --> 00:58:29,646
Tell me, everybody's pickin'up
on that feline beat

744
00:58:29,724 --> 00:58:33,285
- 'Cause everything else is obsolete
- Strictly high-button shoes

745
00:58:33,361 --> 00:58:36,819
A square with a horn
makes you wish you weren't born

746
00:58:36,898 --> 00:58:40,664
Every time he plays

747
00:58:40,735 --> 00:58:44,865
But with a square in the act
you can set music back

748
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:46,873
To the caveman days

749
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:52,846
I've heard some corny birds
who tried to sing

750
00:58:52,914 --> 00:58:57,180
But still a cat's the only cat
who knows how to swing

751
00:58:57,252 --> 00:59:01,746
Who wants to dig a longhaired
gig and stuff like that

752
00:59:01,823 --> 00:59:05,122
When everybody
wants to be a cat

753
00:59:05,193 --> 00:59:08,822
A square with a horn
makes you wish you weren't born

754
00:59:08,897 --> 00:59:10,660
Every time he plays

755
00:59:10,732 --> 00:59:12,927
Oh, a rinky, tinky, dinky

756
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:16,562
With a square in the act
you can set music back

757
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:18,663
To the caveman days

758
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,935
Oh, a rinky, tinky, tinky

759
00:59:21,009 --> 00:59:24,274
Yes, everybody
wants to be a cat

760
00:59:24,345 --> 00:59:28,873
Because a cat's the only cat
who knows where it's at

761
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:33,717
When playing jazz
you always has a welcome mat

762
00:59:33,788 --> 00:59:37,019
'Cause everybody digs
a swingin' cat

763
00:59:37,091 --> 00:59:40,356
Oh, boy, fellas,
let's rock the joint!

764
00:59:41,162 --> 00:59:43,562
Groove it, cats.

765
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:08,254
Shanghai, Hong Kong
egg fu yung

766
01:00:08,323 --> 01:00:10,587
Fortune cookie
always wrong

767
01:00:10,658 --> 01:00:12,455
That's a hot one!

768
01:00:13,795 --> 01:00:15,786
How about you and me,
Duchess?

769
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:19,026
Yes, let's swing it,
Thomas.

770
01:00:21,536 --> 01:00:23,333
Groovy, Mama, groovy!

771
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:28,634
Blow it, small fry, blow it.

772
01:00:30,345 --> 01:00:32,336
Boy, he blew it!

773
01:00:32,413 --> 01:00:34,438
But he was-a close!

774
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:55,365
- Mmm!
- Beautiful!

775
01:00:55,436 --> 01:00:59,304
If you want to turn me on

776
01:00:59,374 --> 01:01:02,866
Play your horn
Don't spare the tone

777
01:01:02,944 --> 01:01:05,504
And blow a little soul

778
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,947
Into the tune

779
01:01:13,721 --> 01:01:18,351
Let's take it to
another key

780
01:01:18,426 --> 01:01:21,520
Modulate
and wait for me

781
01:01:21,596 --> 01:01:25,896
I'll take a few ad-libs
and pretty soon

782
01:01:29,137 --> 01:01:33,073
The other cats
will all commence

783
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:36,736
Congregatin'
on the fence

784
01:01:36,811 --> 01:01:40,144
Beneath the alley's
only light

785
01:01:40,214 --> 01:01:42,614
Where every note is

786
01:01:42,683 --> 01:01:48,588
Out of sight

787
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:56,824
Everybody, everybody

788
01:01:56,898 --> 01:01:59,696
Everybody wants to be a cat

789
01:01:59,767 --> 01:02:03,897
Hallelujah
Everybody, everybody

790
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:06,963
Everybody wants to be a cat

791
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:11,501
I'm tellin' you
Everybody, everybody

792
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:14,412
Everybody wants to be a cat

793
01:02:14,482 --> 01:02:18,851
- Yeah
- Everybody, everybody

794
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,912
Everybody wants to be a cat

795
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:26,221
- Mmm
- Everybody, everybody

796
01:02:26,294 --> 01:02:29,229
Everybody wants to be a cat

797
01:02:29,297 --> 01:02:33,495
- Hallelujah
- Everybody, everybody

798
01:02:33,568 --> 01:02:36,696
Everybody wants to be a cat

799
01:03:00,353 --> 01:03:04,983
Everybody wants
to be a cat

800
01:03:05,058 --> 01:03:10,052
Because a cat's
the only cat

801
01:03:10,129 --> 01:03:14,429
Who knows where
it's at

802
01:03:15,401 --> 01:03:18,996
Oh, yeah

803
01:03:19,072 --> 01:03:22,235
Happy dreams, my loves.

804
01:03:27,613 --> 01:03:31,811
I'll bet they're on
that magic carpet right now.

805
01:03:31,884 --> 01:03:34,148
They could hardly keep
their eyes open.

806
01:03:35,621 --> 01:03:38,488
Oh! Such an exciting day.

807
01:03:38,558 --> 01:03:41,925
It sure was.
And what a finale!

808
01:03:44,497 --> 01:03:48,160
Thomas, your friends
are really delightful.

809
01:03:48,234 --> 01:03:50,168
I just love them.

810
01:03:50,236 --> 01:03:52,636
Well, they're kind a rough,
you know, around the edges.

811
01:03:52,705 --> 01:03:56,801
But if you're ever in a jam,
wham, they're right there.

812
01:03:56,876 --> 01:04:00,471
And, wham,
when we needed you...

813
01:04:00,546 --> 01:04:02,241
you were right there.

814
01:04:02,315 --> 01:04:05,512
Hmm, that was just
a lucky break for me, baby.

815
01:04:05,585 --> 01:04:09,419
Oh, and thank you so much
for offering us your home.

816
01:04:09,489 --> 01:04:13,255
Oh, I mean your pad.

817
01:04:13,326 --> 01:04:16,523
- It's very nice.
- Well now, wait a minute.

818
01:04:16,596 --> 01:04:19,531
You know, this is
the low-rent district, remember?

819
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,658
No, no, no, I like it!

820
01:04:21,734 --> 01:04:26,171
Well, uh, well, all it needs
is a, is a little tidying up.

821
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:31,199
And, well, maybe a,
a little feminine touch.

822
01:04:31,277 --> 01:04:33,541
Well, if you're applying
for the job, well...

823
01:04:33,613 --> 01:04:37,242
Goody! Mother's going
to work for Mr. O'Malley.

824
01:04:38,451 --> 01:04:43,354
Boy! Your eyes
are like sapphires.

825
01:04:45,091 --> 01:04:49,255
Gee! Ha. That's pretty corny,
though, huh?

826
01:04:49,328 --> 01:04:52,593
Oh, no! Not at all.

827
01:04:52,665 --> 01:04:55,600
Any woman would like it.

828
01:04:55,668 --> 01:04:59,229
l, I mean,
even little Marie.

829
01:05:00,807 --> 01:05:06,109
Yeah. All those little kittens,
Duchess, I love 'em.

830
01:05:06,179 --> 01:05:08,511
And they are
very fond of you.

831
01:05:08,581 --> 01:05:10,947
- Yeah!
- Well, you know,
- Shh.
- they need a...

832
01:05:11,017 --> 01:05:14,180
Well, you know, a sort...

833
01:05:14,253 --> 01:05:18,280
Well, a sort of a...
Well, a father around.

834
01:05:18,357 --> 01:05:22,794
Oh, Thomas, Thomas,
that would be wonderful!

835
01:05:22,862 --> 01:05:27,458
Oh, darling,
if, if only I could.

836
01:05:27,533 --> 01:05:31,367
- But why can't ya?
- Because of Madame.

837
01:05:31,437 --> 01:05:33,905
l, I could never leave her.

838
01:05:33,973 --> 01:05:37,773
But, but Madame's...

839
01:05:37,844 --> 01:05:40,574
well, she's just
another human.

840
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:42,614
You're just her house pets.

841
01:05:42,682 --> 01:05:47,119
Oh, no, no! We mean
far more to her than that!

842
01:05:49,021 --> 01:05:52,388
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear...

843
01:05:52,458 --> 01:05:54,926
but we just have
to go home tomorrow.

844
01:05:54,994 --> 01:05:57,189
Yeah.

845
01:05:57,263 --> 01:06:01,495
Well, I guess you know best.

846
01:06:01,567 --> 01:06:04,536
But I'm gonna miss you,
baby.

847
01:06:04,604 --> 01:06:07,937
And those kids!

848
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:09,975
Gee, I'm gonna
miss them, too.

849
01:06:10,042 --> 01:06:13,637
- Well, we almost had a father.
- Yeah.

850
01:06:15,348 --> 01:06:18,010
Let's go back to bed.

851
01:06:21,587 --> 01:06:23,953
Good night, Duchess.

852
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:26,719
Good night, Thomas.

853
01:06:49,582 --> 01:06:54,576
Hey! Meow!

854
01:06:54,654 --> 01:06:57,452
What a classy neighborhood!

855
01:06:57,523 --> 01:07:01,516
- Dig these fancy wigwams.
- Wigwams?

856
01:07:01,594 --> 01:07:03,789
Are you sure we're
on the right street?

857
01:07:03,863 --> 01:07:06,764
Yes. Yes. Let's hurry.
We're almost home.

858
01:07:06,832 --> 01:07:11,098
Duchess! Kittens!
Hallelujah, they're back!

859
01:07:16,342 --> 01:07:20,438
Oh, no! Edgar!
I've got to do something quick!

860
01:07:22,615 --> 01:07:25,778
Edgar, old chap, get used
to the finer things of life.

861
01:07:25,851 --> 01:07:31,016
Ooh, someday they're all going
to be yours, you sly old fox.

862
01:07:32,592 --> 01:07:36,426
Oh!
Oh, he got me!

863
01:07:36,495 --> 01:07:40,397
- Hurray, we're home!
- Wait for me, wait for me!

864
01:07:40,466 --> 01:07:43,629
Me first! Me first!

865
01:07:45,237 --> 01:07:46,704
It's locked.

866
01:07:46,772 --> 01:07:49,900
Come on!
Let's all start meowing.

867
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:56,771
It can't be them!
The kittens!

868
01:08:03,756 --> 01:08:06,020
Don't come in!

869
01:08:08,227 --> 01:08:10,422
Go away! Away!

870
01:08:10,496 --> 01:08:13,056
Look! There's Roquefort.

871
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:16,568
- Hi, Roquefort.
- He's sure glad to see us.

872
01:08:19,138 --> 01:08:21,504
I don't know what to say.

873
01:08:21,574 --> 01:08:23,508
I only wish that l...

874
01:08:23,576 --> 01:08:25,840
Maybe just a...

875
01:08:25,911 --> 01:08:29,347
short, sweet good-bye
would be easiest.

876
01:08:29,415 --> 01:08:33,818
I'll never forget you,
Thomas O'Malley.

877
01:08:35,054 --> 01:08:38,421
- Bye.
- So long, baby.

878
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:42,086
Don't come in!
Look out for Edgar!

879
01:08:50,002 --> 01:08:52,937
Duchess,
wherever have you been?

880
01:08:53,005 --> 01:08:54,802
Look out for the...

881
01:08:56,542 --> 01:08:58,009
sack.

882
01:08:58,077 --> 01:09:01,240
Well...

883
01:09:01,313 --> 01:09:04,051
I guess they won't
need me anymore.

884
01:09:04,184 --> 01:09:06,482
You came back!

885
01:09:06,553 --> 01:09:09,420
Oh, it, it just isn't fair.

886
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:12,755
Edgar! Edgar, come quickly!

887
01:09:12,826 --> 01:09:15,226
Coming, Madame, coming!

888
01:09:15,296 --> 01:09:18,561
I'll take care of you later.

889
01:09:18,632 --> 01:09:22,227
Oh, Edgar, they're back!
I heard them!

890
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,897
Hurry, hurry, let them in.

891
01:09:25,739 --> 01:09:29,004
Duchess? Kittens?

892
01:09:29,076 --> 01:09:33,570
Come here, my darlings.
Where are you? Come on.

893
01:09:33,647 --> 01:09:36,810
Uh, allow me, Madame.

894
01:09:36,884 --> 01:09:39,352
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

895
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:41,911
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

896
01:09:41,989 --> 01:09:43,923
His name is "O"' what?

897
01:09:43,991 --> 01:09:45,959
His name is O'Malley.
O'Malley.

898
01:09:46,026 --> 01:09:48,392
Abraham Delacey
Guiseppe Casey.

899
01:09:48,462 --> 01:09:50,862
Oh, never, never mind.
Just run, move, go get him!

900
01:09:50,931 --> 01:09:53,365
Yes, yes, I'm on my way!

901
01:09:53,434 --> 01:09:56,198
I told you it was Edgar.

902
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:58,670
Aw, shut up, Toulouse.

903
01:09:58,739 --> 01:10:01,333
Oh, it's no use, Edgar.

904
01:10:01,408 --> 01:10:06,038
I'm afraid it was just
the imagination of an old lady.

905
01:10:06,113 --> 01:10:09,879
But I was so sure
that I heard them.

906
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:12,748
I'm so sorry, Madame.

907
01:10:20,861 --> 01:10:23,921
Mr. O'Malley!

908
01:10:26,734 --> 01:10:29,828
Hey, stop!

909
01:10:29,903 --> 01:10:33,839
Duchess, kittens in trouble.
Butler did it.

910
01:10:33,907 --> 01:10:35,704
Duchess and kittens
in trouble?

911
01:10:35,776 --> 01:10:39,109
Look, you go get Scat Cat
and his gang of alley cats.

912
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:42,808
A-Alley cats?
But I'm a mouse!

913
01:10:42,883 --> 01:10:45,818
- Look, I'm gonna need help.
- You mean you want me...

914
01:10:45,886 --> 01:10:49,754
Move! Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you,
and you won't have a bit of trouble.

915
01:10:56,997 --> 01:10:59,124
" No trouble," he said.

916
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:02,635
Well, that's easy for, ah,
for what's-his-name to say.

917
01:11:02,703 --> 01:11:05,763
He's got nine lives.
I've only got one.

918
01:11:10,244 --> 01:11:13,509
What's a little swinger like you
doin' on our side of town?

919
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:17,983
Oh, please, ah, I was sent here
for help by a cat.

920
01:11:18,051 --> 01:11:20,679
Why, this is outrageous!
This is crazy!

921
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:24,815
Kinky!

922
01:11:26,326 --> 01:11:30,353
Oh, but, but honest!
He told me just to mention his name.

923
01:11:30,431 --> 01:11:33,525
So, start mentioning name,
rodent!

924
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,591
Now... Oh, now, wait a minute,
fellows.

925
01:11:35,669 --> 01:11:39,628
Lo... Don... Look, don't, don't, don't,
don't rush me. His name is O'Toole.

926
01:11:39,706 --> 01:11:42,641
I don't dig him.
Strike one.

927
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:45,940
Oh, ooh, O'Brien!

928
01:11:46,013 --> 01:11:48,982
- Strike two.
- Oh, boy.

929
01:11:49,049 --> 01:11:53,645
- You believe me, don't you?
- Keep talkin', mousey.

930
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,986
H-How about O'Grady?

931
01:11:58,058 --> 01:11:59,650
Huh?

932
01:11:59,726 --> 01:12:03,856
Mousey, you just struck out.
Any last words?

933
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:07,731
Oh, no, oh! Why did I listen
to that O'Malley cat?

934
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:10,964
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?

935
01:12:11,038 --> 01:12:13,734
Hold it, cats.
This little guy is on the level.

936
01:12:13,807 --> 01:12:16,469
You're darn tootin'
I'm on the level!

937
01:12:16,543 --> 01:12:19,535
Oh, we didn't mean-a to,
to rough-a you, squeaky.

938
01:12:19,613 --> 01:12:22,343
Don't worry about me.
O'Malley needs help.

939
01:12:22,416 --> 01:12:24,577
Duchess and the kittens
are in trouble.

940
01:12:24,651 --> 01:12:26,642
Come on, cats.
We gotta split.

941
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:30,156
Hey, wait for me!
You don't know the way!

942
01:12:52,012 --> 01:12:57,314
Now, my little pesky pets,
you're going to travel first-class...

943
01:12:57,384 --> 01:13:00,148
in your own
private compartment...

944
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:03,383
all the way to Timbuktu.

945
01:13:03,457 --> 01:13:07,325
And this time,
you'll never come back.

946
01:13:07,394 --> 01:13:10,522
Oh, oh, oh,
we-we-we've got to hurry.

947
01:13:10,597 --> 01:13:13,065
The baggage truck will be here
any moment now.

948
01:13:18,472 --> 01:13:20,736
Ooh!

949
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:12,757
Over there!
They're in the trunk!

950
01:14:24,805 --> 01:14:26,773
Quiet!

951
01:14:33,747 --> 01:14:36,875
Everybody out of here fast.

952
01:14:38,418 --> 01:14:42,445
You're going to Timbuktu...

953
01:14:42,522 --> 01:14:45,958
if it's the last thing I do.

954
01:15:12,085 --> 01:15:14,918
Well, Mac, this must be
the trunk, eh?

955
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:19,049
Yup! And she goes
all the way to Timbuktu.

956
01:15:19,126 --> 01:15:21,651
Heave ho!

957
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:48,322
Now, my pets,
a little closer together.

958
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,425
Good! Good!

959
01:15:50,502 --> 01:15:53,232
Look, Georges,
what do you think?

960
01:15:53,305 --> 01:15:56,365
Very good, very good!

961
01:15:56,441 --> 01:15:58,432
But I think we should
get on with the will.

962
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:02,469
Yes, yes, of course.
But you know what to do.

963
01:16:02,548 --> 01:16:05,745
Very well.
Scratch one butler.

964
01:16:05,818 --> 01:16:10,346
You know, Georges, if Edgar
had only known about the will...

965
01:16:10,422 --> 01:16:13,880
I'm sure he never
would have left.

966
01:16:13,959 --> 01:16:16,450
Duchess, it's wonderful
to have you all back.

967
01:16:16,528 --> 01:16:20,692
And I think this young man
is very handsome.

968
01:16:20,766 --> 01:16:23,030
Shall we keep him
in the family?

969
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:26,997
Of course we will.

970
01:16:27,072 --> 01:16:29,700
We need a man
around the house.

971
01:16:29,775 --> 01:16:34,769
An-and, Georges, we must be sure to
provide for their future little ones.

972
01:16:35,948 --> 01:16:39,076
Of course!
The more the merrier.

973
01:16:40,919 --> 01:16:45,288
Now, don't move.
Smile.

974
01:16:45,357 --> 01:16:47,484
Say cheese!

975
01:16:47,559 --> 01:16:50,323
Did somebody say "cheese"?

976
01:16:50,395 --> 01:16:52,124
Thank you.

977
01:16:52,197 --> 01:16:56,998
Now, run along downstairs.
There's a surprise for you.

978
01:17:02,808 --> 01:17:05,072
Adelaide,
what's that music?

979
01:17:05,143 --> 01:17:08,840
Sounds like a gang
of swinging hep cats.

980
01:17:08,914 --> 01:17:11,075
That's exactly what
they are, Georges.

981
01:17:11,149 --> 01:17:14,243
They're the start
of my new foundation.

982
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:16,446
What foundation?

983
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:20,252
My home for all the alley cats
of Paris.

984
01:17:24,263 --> 01:17:27,721
Everybody, everybody

985
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:30,768
Everybody wants to be a cat

986
01:17:31,603 --> 01:17:34,731
Everybody, everybody

987
01:17:34,806 --> 01:17:38,765
Everybody wants to be a cat

988
01:17:38,844 --> 01:17:42,405
Everybody, everybody

989
01:17:42,481 --> 01:17:45,917
Everybody wants to be a cat

990
01:17:45,984 --> 01:17:49,681
Everybody, whoopee

991
01:17:49,755 --> 01:17:53,282
Everybody wants to be a cat

992
01:17:53,358 --> 01:17:57,089
Everybody, everybody

993
01:17:57,162 --> 01:18:00,529
Everybody wants to be

994
01:18:00,599 --> 01:18:05,832
A cat

995
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,702
Hey, Napoleon,
that sounds like the end.

996
01:18:11,836 --> 01:18:14,805
Wait a minute.
I'm the leader.

997
01:18:14,872 --> 01:18:17,204
I'll say when it's the end.

998
01:18:18,442 --> 01:18:20,467
It's the end.

999
01:18:31,122 --> 01:18:34,889
Oh, yeah
