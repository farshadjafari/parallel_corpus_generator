1
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:53,195
When you love someone,
you've gotta trust them.

2
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:55,160
There's no other way.

3
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:58,874
You've got to give them the key
to everything that's yours.

4
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:03,164
Otherwise, what's the point?

5
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:08,333
And, for a while, I believed
that's the kind of love I had.

6
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:17,242
Before I ever ran a casino,
or got myself blown up...

7
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:21,502
Ace Rothstein was a hell
of a handicapper, I can tell you that.

8
00:03:21,582 --> 00:03:24,172
I was so good that whenever I bet,
I could change the odds...

9
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:26,171
for every bookmaker
in the country.

10
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:28,711
I'm serious,
I had it down so cold...

11
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:31,171
that I was given
paradise on earth.

12
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:35,431
I was given one of the biggest casinos
in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...

13
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:39,810
by the only kind of guys that can
actually get you that kind of money...

14
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,650
$62,700,000.

15
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,610
I don't know all the details.

16
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,279
Nobody knew all the details,
but it should've been perfect.

17
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,149
I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro,
his best friend, watching his ass...

18
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,159
and he had, Ginger,
the woman he loved, on his arm.

19
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,038
But in the end,
we fucked it all up.

20
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:03,118
It should've been so sweet too.

21
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,628
But it turned out to be the last time
that street guys like us...

22
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:09,498
were ever given anything
that fuckin' valuable again.

23
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:16,797
At that time, Vegas was a place
where millions of suckers...

24
00:04:16,837 --> 00:04:18,807
flew in every year
on their own nickel...

25
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:21,466
and left behind
about a billion dollars.

26
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:25,186
But at night, you couldn't see
the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.

27
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,186
But it's in the desert where lots
of the town's problems are solved.

28
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:33,315
Got a lot of holes
in the desert...

29
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:36,405
and a lot of problems
are buried in those holes.

30
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,405
Except you gotta do it right.

31
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:40,405
I mean, you gotta have
the hole already dug...

32
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:43,405
before you show up
with a package in the trunk.

33
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:46,284
Otherwise, you're talking about
a half hour or 45 minutes of diggin'.

34
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:48,994
And who knows who's gonna
be comin' along in that time?

35
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:51,914
Before you know it,
you gotta dig a few more holes.

36
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:54,714
You could be there
all fuckin' night.

37
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,272
Who could resist?

38
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:15,312
Anywhere else in the country
I was a bookie, a gambler...

39
00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:18,271
always lookin' over my shoulder,
hassled by cops, day and night.

40
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,821
But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.

41
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:23,691
I'm not only legitimate,
but running a casino.

42
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,661
And that's like selling people
dreams for cash.

43
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:31,990
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert,
as my manager, and I went to work.

44
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,040
...the casino manager. And this is
Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.

45
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,039
For guys like me,
Las Vegas washes away your sins.

46
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:43,169
It's like a morality car wash.

47
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:46,719
It does for us what Lourdes
does for humpbacks and cripples.

48
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:55,348
And along with making us legit...

49
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:58,978
comes cash, tons of it.

50
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:01,858
I mean, what do you think we're doing
out here in the middle of the desert?

51
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:04,977
It's all this money.

52
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:07,397
This is the end result
of all the bright lights...

53
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:10,567
and the comp trips,
of all the champagne...

54
00:06:10,657 --> 00:06:14,287
and free hotel suites,
and all the broads and all the booze.

55
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:18,956
It's all been arranged
just for us to get your money.

56
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,126
That's the truth about Las Vegas.

57
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:26,505
We're the only winners.

58
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:28,505
The players don't stand a chance.

59
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:31,835
And their cash flows
from the tables...

60
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:34,635
to our boxes
through the cage...

61
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:37,265
and into the most sacred room
in the casino.

62
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:39,514
The place where they add up
all the money...

63
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:42,014
the holy of holies,
the count room.

64
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:47,314
- Now, this place was off-limits.
- Verify 3,000.

65
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:49,313
Even I couldn't get inside.

66
00:06:49,393 --> 00:06:51,773
But it was my job to keep it filled
with cash. That's for sure.

67
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:53,773
They had so much
fuckin' money in there...

68
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:56,613
you could build a house out
of stacks of hundred-dollar bills.

69
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:58,613
And the best part
was that upstairs...

70
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:00,912
- the board of directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.
- Five thousand.

71
00:07:00,992 --> 00:07:03,412
I mean, to them everything
looked on the up-and-up.

72
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:05,412
Right? Wrong.

73
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,412
Verify 5,000.

74
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:09,412
- The guys inside the counting room...
- Five thousand.

75
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:12,331
Were all slipped in there
to skim the joint dry.

76
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:15,551
They'd do short counts,
they'd lose fill slips.

77
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:18,091
They'd even take cash
right out of the drop boxes.

78
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,091
And it was up to this guy
right here...

79
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:22,221
standin' in front
of about two million dollars...

80
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:25,720
to skim the cash off the top
without anybody gettin' wise...

81
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,020
- the IRS or anybody.
- Verify 200.

82
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,230
Now, notice how in the count room
nobody ever seems to see anything.

83
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,610
Somehow, somebody's always
lookin' the other way.

84
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,729
Now, look at these guys.
They look busy, right?

85
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,529
They're countin' money.
Who wants to bother them?

86
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:42,199
I mean, God forbid they should make
a mistake and forget to steal.

87
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:45,739
Meanwhile,
you're in and you're out.

88
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:48,658
Past the jag-off guard
who gets an extra C-note a week...

89
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,328
just to watch the door.

90
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:55,378
It's routine. Business as usual:
In, out, hello, good-bye.

91
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:57,377
And that's all there is to it.

92
00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:00,717
Just another fat fuck walkin' out
of the casino with a suitcase.

93
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:04,887
Now that suitcase was goin'
straight to one place:

94
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:07,677
Right to Kansas City,
which was as close...

95
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:09,806
to Las Vegas as the Midwest
bosses could go...

96
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:12,186
without gettin' themselves arrested.

97
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:14,516
That suitcase was all...

98
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:16,516
the bosses ever wanted.

99
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:19,856
- And they wanted it every month.
- Hey, John, how was your ride?

100
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,905
Now this old Mormon fuck here...

101
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:30,325
he had to fly in with suitcases
once a month, nice and easy.

102
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:32,904
- Somethin' smells good.
- Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat.

103
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:35,114
The bosses would come
from all over the place:

104
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:37,454
Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee...

105
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:39,544
all over the Midwest.

106
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:42,584
And they would meet in the back
of this produce market in Kansas City.

107
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:44,793
I mean, nobody even knew it.

108
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,133
One of the guys made
his mother do all the cookin'.

109
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:49,383
- Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?
- Jerry Steriano?

110
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:51,973
Now, these old greaseballs
might not look it...

111
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:53,343
but believe me...

112
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:55,932
these are the guys
who secretly control Las Vegas.

113
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:58,142
Mama, that man's here again.

114
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:00,602
Because they control
the Teamsters Union.

115
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:03,522
And that's where you had to go if you
wanted to borrow money to buy a casino.

116
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:05,771
- Would you put in shrimp?
- I would.

117
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,521
Here you are, gentlemen.

118
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:09,771
Nobody got a Teamsters' loan
unless the guys in this room...

119
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:12,441
knew they were gonna get
their little suitcases.

120
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:16,821
Guys like this antique over here,
out of Detroit.

121
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,700
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi,
the outfit's top boss.

122
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,540
You got a round figure on it?

123
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,580
- Definitely the most important guy in this room.
- About 20 pounds.

124
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,959
- That's around 700,000.
- Uh-huh, good.

125
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,169
I know it's
a little early for Las Vegas...

126
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:37,389
But I do want to welcome the ladies
and gentlemen of the gaming industry.

127
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,429
As far as the world
was concerned...

128
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:42,178
Andy Stone, the head of
the Teamsters' Pension Fund...

129
00:09:42,268 --> 00:09:45,228
- was a legitimate guy.
- This is a very auspicious occasion.

130
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:47,268
- A powerful man.
- Philip, if you would rise.

131
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:49,268
He even played golf
with the president.

132
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:51,687
On behalf of the Teamsters'
Pension Fund...

133
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:54,237
- it is my pleasure to present to you...
- But Andy also took orders.

134
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:57,317
And when he was told to give
a pension fund loan to Philip Green...

135
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:00,327
this check for $62,700,000...

136
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:02,866
for the new Tangiers.

137
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:04,996
He did what he was told.

138
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:06,996
Now, here was
the perfect front man.

139
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:09,076
What the fuck else could he be?
He didn't know too much.

140
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,876
He didn't want to know
too much...

141
00:10:10,956 --> 00:10:13,755
especially that the bosses made
the Teamsters lend him the money.

142
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:15,505
He wanted to believe
the Teamsters...

143
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,125
gave him all that fuckin' money
'cause he was smart.

144
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:20,675
I know full well how much competition
we have in this great city.

145
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:26,514
And where they got Green from?

146
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:28,304
Who the fuck knows?

147
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:30,804
All I know is that Green was
an Arizona real estate hustler...

148
00:10:30,894 --> 00:10:32,854
who barely had
enough gas money...

149
00:10:32,894 --> 00:10:35,144
to come and pick up
his own fuckin' check.

150
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,193
And of course it was
the bosses' man...

151
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:39,193
Andy Stone,
who gave all the orders.

152
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,653
Not the chairman
of the fuckin' board, Philip Green.

153
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:43,903
I understand.
I understand.

154
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:49,202
Now all they needed was...

155
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:51,282
somebody they could trust
to run the casino.

156
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:54,742
And who better than Ace? I mean, he was
already in Vegas a couple years...

157
00:10:54,832 --> 00:10:56,832
and he had
the fuckin' place clocked.

158
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:59,501
But typical Ace, give him a shot
at runnin' a casino...

159
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,961
and he tries
to talk you out of it.

160
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:04,381
I don't know if I could do this
even if I wanted to.

161
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:06,131
The Gaming Commission
would never give me a license.

162
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,681
I have at least two dozen
gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

163
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:12,430
You don't have to have a license
to work in a casino.

164
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,560
All you gotta do
is apply for one.

165
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,930
The state law says that
you can work in a casino...

166
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,100
while they're processing
your application.

167
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,100
They got a ten-year backlog.

168
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,109
What happens when
they do find out?

169
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:25,149
Why would they
want to find out?

170
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:28,149
We're puttin' a hundred million into this
desert. Why would they want to lock us out?

171
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:32,069
They'll never find out. All you gotta do
is keep changing your job title.

172
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:36,698
Like, uh, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

173
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:39,958
They take your application,
they put it at the bottom of the pile.

174
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:43,208
I know guys been workin' there
for 30 years, don't have a license.

175
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,707
It's a tough proposition, Andy.

176
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:49,667
You know if I did it,
I'd have to run it my way.

177
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:51,547
You got it.

178
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:54,097
I'm serious, no interference.

179
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:56,506
Nobody's gonna interfere
with your running the casino.

180
00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:58,846
I guarantee it.

181
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:03,436
And that's how
they got Ace to take over.

182
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:08,315
They wanted him because Ace ate,
slept and breathed gambling.

183
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:13,445
They worked out
a real cute job title too...

184
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:16,445
Tangiers Public Relations Director.

185
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,959
But the only thing he ever
directed was the casino.

186
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:23,364
He made his first bet when he was
15 years old, and he always made money.

187
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:25,954
But he didn't bet
like you or me.

188
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:28,794
You know, havin' some fun
with it, shit like that.

189
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,873
Where the hell
did you learn how to deal?

190
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:33,713
He bet like a fuckin'
brain surgeon.

191
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:35,963
Place the checks properly.

192
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:37,923
- That's the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:39,763
He had to know everything,
this guy.

194
00:12:39,803 --> 00:12:41,972
He'd find out the kind
of inside stuff nobody else knew...

195
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,762
and that's what he'd put
his money on.

196
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:47,722
Even back home, years ago...

197
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,722
when we were first hangin' out...

198
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,392
he'd know if the quarterback
was on coke...

199
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:54,236
I'll take Columbia for 20.

200
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:56,401
- If his girlfriend was knocked up.
- Twenty dimes on Columbia.

201
00:12:56,481 --> 00:12:59,861
He'd get the wind velocity
so he could judge the field goals.

202
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:01,781
He even figured out
the different bounce...

203
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:03,781
you got off the different kinds
of wood they used...

204
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:05,780
on college basketball courts,
you know?

205
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,780
He'd be workin'
on this shit day and night.

206
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,080
There was nothing about a game
he was gonna bet that he didn't know.

207
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,620
Ace got down at six.
Get me down at six.

208
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,380
Season after season...

209
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,039
the prick was the only
guaranteed winner I ever knew.

210
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,049
But he was so serious
about it all...

211
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:22,509
that I don't think
he ever enjoyed himself.

212
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,629
But that's just the way he was.

213
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,468
But back then, the bosses
didn't give a fuck...

214
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:29,558
about whether
he enjoyed himself or not.

215
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:32,558
To them, he was
a cash register.

216
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:35,348
All they had to do was
ring the bell and take money.

217
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:37,148
Especially Remo...

218
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:39,567
who was a fuckin' degenerate
gambler who always lost...

219
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:41,607
Cazzo!

220
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,237
All those fuckin' sweeps.

221
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:47,237
- Unless Ace made his bets.
- Enough now!

222
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,327
Ace made more money
for them on a weekend...

223
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:52,536
than I could do heisting
joints for a month.

224
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:54,996
Whatever Ace picked up
on the street, he told Remo.

225
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,836
I mean, fixed fights,
doped horses...

226
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,205
crooked fuckin' zebras,
locked-in point spreads.

227
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:04,215
He told fuckin' Remo everything.

228
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:07,465
And to tell you the truth,
I don't blame him.

229
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:09,595
- Hey!
- Keepin' Remo happy with money...

230
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,925
was the greatest insurance
policy in the world.

231
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:15,014
Son of a bitch!

232
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,014
How the hell did you get
Oklahoma-Michigan?

233
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:19,394
Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi...
How the hell'd you do it?

234
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:21,434
Well, that's why
they paid so well.

235
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:23,524
You see?
Never tells me nothin'.

236
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:25,773
What do we got on
for next week?

237
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:29,863
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say
Thursday would be good. Is that all right?

238
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:32,783
- Okay, you'll come by the house?
- I'll come by.

239
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:36,862
7:00. Good job, my boy.
Keep it up? Okay, Ace?

240
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:40,202
Hey, Nick. Vien acca.

241
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:42,542
- I'll be right out.
- T'aggia parla.

242
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:45,662
Nicky, see that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.

243
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:47,671
He's makin'
a lot of money for us.

244
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:50,961
And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of
money for us, so keep a good eye on him.

245
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,711
Not like your fuckin' friends
out there that... without brains.

246
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:56,051
- Okay?
- All right.

247
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:58,090
- Mi raccomando.
- Yeah. Want me to take this for you?

248
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,390
So now,
on top of everything else...

249
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,890
I gotta make sure nobody fucks around
with the golden Jew.

250
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,480
Chase, couple of shooters
for the ladies.

251
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,980
Yeah, we made a great pair.

252
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,609
I made book and Nicky made sure
we always collected.

253
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:14,899
The old men loved us,
and why not?

254
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:16,989
- They all made money with us.
- They payin'?

255
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:19,359
- How did Nicky collect?
- They pay every week, like they're supposed to.

256
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,868
- Don't ask.
- And where the fuck is the money? I don't see any money.

257
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:25,248
- Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
- Hi, Sam.

258
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:28,078
Who's this guy?

259
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:31,128
- Get the fuck out of here. It was nine. I laid nine.
- It was eight.

260
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,247
Ace, tell him the line
on the Bear game.

261
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:36,417
- Eight.
- If he don't know, nobody knows.

262
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:38,417
- Told you it was eight.
- How come I laid nine?

263
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:40,507
'Cause you're a jag-off.

264
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:42,507
- Excuse me.
- What?

265
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:46,096
- Is this yours? Your pen?
- Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

266
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:48,096
No, it's a nice pen.
I just didn't know whose it was.

267
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:50,096
I thought it was yours.
I didn't want it to get lost.

268
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:52,606
Well, thank you.
Why don't you take that fuckin' pen...

269
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,275
and shove it up your ass,
you fuckin' jag-off.

270
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:59,195
- Well, I was just offering you the...
- This fuckin' assho...

271
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:01,155
Look out, Joe. Look out.

272
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:24,503
What's that?
You hear a little girl, Frankie?

273
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:27,133
Hear a little girl, Ace?
Is that a little fuckin' girl?

274
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:29,132
What happened
to the fuckin' tough guy...

275
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,342
- told my friend to stick it
up his fuckin' ass?

276
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:34,352
Nicky, take it easy. Nicky, Nicky.

277
00:16:41,351 --> 00:16:44,271
While I was trying
to figure out why the guy was saying...

278
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:47,111
what he was saying,
Nicky just hit him.

279
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:50,611
No matter how big a guy might be,
Nicky would take him on.

280
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:53,030
You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat.

281
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,580
You beat him with a knife,
he comes back with a gun.

282
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,160
And if you beat him with a gun,
you better kill him...

283
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,000
because he'll keep coming
back and back...

284
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,499
until one of you is dead.

285
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:16,138
Listen,
with me protectin' Ace...

286
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:18,968
he made a fortune
for the bosses.

287
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:22,348
I mean, that's
what got him to Vegas.

288
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:25,308
He was a money machine.

289
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:28,067
A tremendous earner
for these guys.

290
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:31,107
As soon as he took over,
he doubled the fuckin' drop.

291
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:35,027
With Ace, the casino
never saw so much money.

292
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:38,026
And the bosses,
they couldn't be happier.

293
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:40,036
# I got $700 #

294
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:42,036
# Don't you mess with me #

295
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:45,076
# But you know I'm down #

296
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:49,955
# Everybody knows I'm down ##

297
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:58,845
In Vegas, I had to keep
a few juiced-in local cowboys working.

298
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:00,884
They were close to the,
you know, good old boys.

299
00:18:00,964 --> 00:18:05,304
I mean, without us, these guys,
they'd still be shoveling mule shit.

300
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:07,304
Ward, you've got to keep
a cleaner space.

301
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:09,474
If you need Mr. Clean,
page him, all right?

302
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:11,473
Won't happen again, Sam.

303
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:15,143
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Mr. Rothstein. Won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.

304
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:18,233
Is this guy just another dumb fucking
white man, or what? What's the story?

305
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:20,733
- You need this guy.
- Can't get rid of him?

306
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:23,322
He's juiced in.
He's the County Commissioner's cousin.

307
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:25,412
I wouldn't give the bum
a mop job.

308
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:28,032
But still, I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.

309
00:18:28,122 --> 00:18:30,082
These yokels ran the state.

310
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:31,742
Thank you very much,
Senator.

311
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,911
- They passed the laws, they owned the courts.
- Hi, Ace. Hey, I need a room.

312
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:37,631
- I had dozens of politicians and state officials...
- The Cedar Room.

313
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,636
Coming through that place
every week.

314
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:41,631
- Help the Senator, get him whatever he wants.
- Certainly.

315
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:44,051
Why not make him happy?

316
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:46,760
...the Presidential Suite.

317
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,269
For politicians like our State Senator
up there, everything was on the house.

318
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:02,149
These guys won their comp life
when they got elected...

319
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:05,569
so, hey, why not
take advantage of it.

320
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:09,118
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.

321
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:11,618
It's a whale
like K.K. Ichikawa...

322
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:14,538
who plays $30,000 a hand
in baccarat...

323
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:16,708
that's the one
you really gotta watch.

324
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,077
He plays fast and big
and he has the cash and the credit...

325
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,087
to turn out your lights.

326
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:26,087
About a year ago he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the Cayman Islands.

327
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,217
Downstairs he takes us
for two million...

328
00:19:28,337 --> 00:19:32,506
and upstairs he takes free
soap, shampoo and towels.

329
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:35,226
Another billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms...

330
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:39,346
free private jets and
two million of our money.

331
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:41,856
But we got him back.

332
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:44,395
I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

333
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,645
I don't know what the hell went wrong.
I'm awfully sorry.

334
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,905
I can't understand it. These mechanical
things, you know they happen.

335
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:52,485
Hey, but better here than
up there, you know what I mean.

336
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:55,154
Then he missed the commercial
flights connecting with Japan.

337
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:57,364
I can't believe that there's
a convention; there's no room.

338
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,753
We got him back with a whole floor
of rooms to himself.

339
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,793
- I'm sorry you missed your plane.
- Glad to get to know you.

340
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:11,133
Oh, no. No gambling.

341
00:20:13,803 --> 00:20:16,762
And once he was back,
he played small.

342
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:22,892
He bet 1,000 a hand,
instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.

343
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,932
...to the bank
with a natural lead over a five.

344
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:29,141
But I knew the trick
with whales like Ichikawa...

345
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:32,191
was that they can't bet
small for long.

346
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,151
He didn't think of it
as winning 10,000...

347
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:37,491
he thought of it
as losing 90,000.

348
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:40,530
So, he upped his bets.

349
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,700
Until he dropped his winnings back
and gave up a million of his own cash.

350
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:52,999
In the casino, the cardinal rule
is to keep them playing...

351
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,209
and keep them coming back.

352
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,629
The longer they play,
the more they lose.

353
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:00,009
In the end, we get it all.

354
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:03,008
# Goddamn it
Trying to make it real #

355
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:05,008
# Compared to what #

356
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:08,178
# Sock it to me #

357
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:13,188
In Vegas, everybody's
gotta watch everybody else.

358
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:15,477
Six. All right,
who's gonna give me that?

359
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,477
Since the players are looking
to beat the casino...

360
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,147
Each and every roll,
all right.

361
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:23,157
- The dealers are watching the players...
- Six.

362
00:21:23,197 --> 00:21:26,986
- Fake a six.
- The boxmen are watching the dealers.

363
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,906
The floormen are watching
the boxmen...

364
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:32,746
the pit bosses are watching
the floormen...

365
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,706
the shift bosses are watching
the pit bosses...

366
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:38,665
the casino manager is watching
the shift bosses...

367
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:40,875
I'm watching the casino manager...

368
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:44,175
and the eye in the sky
is watching us all.

369
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:50,514
Plus, we had
a dozen guys up there...

370
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:54,054
most of them ex-cheats, who knew
every trick in the house.

371
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:04,443
# Tryin' to make it real
compared to what #

372
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:16,202
Yes!

373
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:19,042
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.

374
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:33,090
Lookin' good.
Lookin' good.

375
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,090
Let's go.
This is for Ginger. Come on.

376
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,100
Let me have a hundred
on your hard ten.

377
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,140
Hundred on your hard ten.
Thank you.

378
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,730
Here we go now.
Yeeeow!

379
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,448
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- The dice...

380
00:22:56,568 --> 00:22:59,408
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

381
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:01,908
- Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
- You were great.

382
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:04,958
Thanks. Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.

383
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:08,377
This hundred is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.

384
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:12,127
- Come on.
- What's the matter?

385
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:15,837
What do you mean? I made a lot
of money for you, I want my cut.

386
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:18,007
What money? I've seen
you stealing from me.

387
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:20,006
What money?
Look at the stack of chips.

388
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:22,306
- I want my half.
- I've been watching you all night.

389
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:24,846
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of fucking chips.

390
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:27,686
- I didn't steal anything from you.
- Get lost!

391
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:30,265
Get lost? Get lost?
Yes! Yes!

392
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:34,065
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!

393
00:23:35,855 --> 00:23:38,405
# Slippin' and a-slidin' #
Changin' and a-hidin' #

394
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,865
# Been told a long time ago #

395
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:43,614
# I been told
Baby, you've been born #

396
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:45,904
# I won't be your fool no more
Oww #

397
00:23:52,703 --> 00:23:59,383
# Baby, oh, baby #

398
00:23:59,423 --> 00:24:03,343
# My sweet baby #

399
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:04,512
# You're the one #

400
00:24:23,821 --> 00:24:25,741
What a move.

401
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:27,740
I fell in love right there.

402
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,870
But in Vegas, for a girl
like Ginger, love costs money.

403
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,790
# What's different about him #

404
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,540
# I don't really know #

405
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,669
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

406
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:44,709
# No matter how I try #

407
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:49,548
# I just can't make him cry #

408
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:53,558
- Ginger's mission in life was money.
- I'll be right back.

409
00:24:53,598 --> 00:24:55,558
- See you, Ginger.
- Okay, thank you for asking.

410
00:24:55,598 --> 00:24:57,348
She was a queen
around the casino.

411
00:24:57,388 --> 00:24:59,138
She brought in high rollers...

412
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:01,307
and helped them spread
around a lot of money.

413
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:03,477
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger. How you doing?

414
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,977
Great, and I have something for you.
You got me covered?

415
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:08,947
- And you do. Thank you very much.
- Take care of yourself.

416
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:11,607
- I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
- Oh, yeah.

417
00:25:11,697 --> 00:25:14,116
Who didn't want Ginger?
She was one of the best known...

418
00:25:14,156 --> 00:25:17,406
best liked and
most respected hustlers in town.

419
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:23,875
Smart hustlers like her
could keep a guy awake...

420
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,125
for two or three days
before sending him home broke...

421
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:28,295
to the little woman
and his bank examiners.

422
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:31,085
# You only make me glad #

423
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:36,304
# Better listen, little girl #

424
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:40,054
# You're goin' walkin'
down the street #

425
00:25:40,134 --> 00:25:43,854
# I ain't got no love #

426
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:46,473
Any change?

427
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:51,443
Oh, I hit a few games
on the way back.

428
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,233
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.

429
00:25:54,313 --> 00:25:55,693
# This heart of stone #

430
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,282
- How you doin' tonight?
- Good.

431
00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:01,362
- How are you?
- Uh, beat.

432
00:26:01,452 --> 00:26:03,992
- Ginger had the hustlers code.
- Take one for you.

433
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:07,122
- Thank you.
- She knew how to take care of people.

434
00:26:07,162 --> 00:26:09,701
And that's what Vegas
is all about.

435
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:12,636
- Sixty-eight hundred.
- Thanks.

436
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,081
- It's kickback city.
- Have a good night.

437
00:26:15,131 --> 00:26:17,001
Thank you. You too.

438
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,970
- She took care of the dealers...
- Hey, Mitch.

439
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,140
Pit bosses, floor managers...

440
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,140
but, mostly, she took care
of the valet parkers...

441
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,680
the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything.

442
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:33,479
Ginger took care of the parkers...

443
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,689
because they took care
of the security guards...

444
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:39,359
- who took care of the metro cops, who let her operate.
- I need that stuff tonight.

445
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:42,739
- No problem.
- You are a doll.

446
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,738
The valet parking job
was such a money-maker...

447
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:48,488
they had to pay off the hotel manager
just to get the concession.

448
00:26:48,578 --> 00:26:51,248
But one thing
I just could never understand...

449
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:53,748
was that she could have
everything under control...

450
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:56,917
except for her old pimp
boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

451
00:26:56,997 --> 00:27:01,047
Gin, you know I got other people
in this, they got partners.

452
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,217
I want you to understand
that I am looking out for you...

453
00:27:03,257 --> 00:27:05,217
in this thing, okay?

454
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:08,596
You're gonna get yours back,
and you're gonna get back first, okay?

455
00:27:08,716 --> 00:27:11,976
- All right, yeah.
- Where you going?

456
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:14,386
Where are you? You're
in that place. Where are you?

457
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:16,396
- I'm here.
- No, you're not.

458
00:27:16,476 --> 00:27:20,015
Where are you?
Where are you?

459
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,775
I'm always here for you.

460
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:25,695
- You're my woman.
- I know.

461
00:27:25,815 --> 00:27:29,734
The Ginger I knew wouldn't
even look at this creep.

462
00:27:29,824 --> 00:27:31,904
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

463
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:33,904
He was a moocher,
a card cheat...

464
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:36,664
a country club golf hustler,
a scumbag.

465
00:27:36,744 --> 00:27:39,334
- Chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.

466
00:27:39,414 --> 00:27:41,793
The guy was always broke.
He always had a story.

467
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:44,413
And somehow she could never
turn him down.

468
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:47,333
The way Ginger saw it, I guess,
was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.

469
00:27:47,383 --> 00:27:49,503
Somebody had
to take care of him.

470
00:27:49,843 --> 00:27:53,632
But nobody
had to take care of Nicky.

471
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:56,552
If you find any cash in there,
we'll whack it up with you.

472
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:58,552
I mean, he took care
of himself only too well.

473
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:02,312
- That's why every badge...
- I folded these things beautifully.

474
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:04,351
- Back home wanted to nail him.
- I would appreciate a little respect.

475
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:07,351
- Look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.
- Jesus Christ.

476
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:09,361
# Volare #

477
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:11,361
Even after a little vacation,
they hassled him at the airport.

478
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:14,031
I mean, Frank Marino was there
to meet him, but so were the cops.

479
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:16,280
This time they wanted
to pinch him...

480
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,490
- for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Will you help me fold these?

481
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,740
They were ready to blame him for
anything, no matter where it happened.

482
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,990
- Put your things away.
- And they were usually right.

483
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,709
- Hold it, hold it. Here.
- Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.

484
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:28,959
- And he didn't give a damn who knew it.
- Come on, there we go.

485
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,629
Look at this. Beautiful!

486
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:37,088
I mean, that's what worried me. 'Cause it
turns out, Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.

487
00:28:37,178 --> 00:28:41,008
- All right, we're clear.
- There's more.

488
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:43,218
There's a couple stuck in there.
I know there's more.

489
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:46,388
- I'm telling you, they're out!
- Come on.

490
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:50,017
Don't get so defensive,
it could be stuck in your hair.

491
00:28:50,057 --> 00:28:52,227
What's that?
Huh, what's that?

492
00:28:52,317 --> 00:28:54,977
There's no more.
Thanks, hon.

493
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,947
I couldn't wait to get
my hands on Vegas.

494
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,196
But the bosses didn't send me
out there to have a good time.

495
00:29:00,236 --> 00:29:03,736
They sent me out there to make sure
that nobody fucked with Ace.

496
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,746
And nobody interfered
with the fuckin' skim.

497
00:29:08,156 --> 00:29:10,786
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doin'?

498
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,785
Hey, Sammy.

499
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:16,045
- Boy, look at this place, huh?
- Incredible.

500
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,415
Welcome to Vegas.

501
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:20,545
- Okay, Sammy.
- Something, huh?

502
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,714
Ginger.

503
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:30,304
Holy shit. What've you
been doing out here?

504
00:29:30,344 --> 00:29:33,144
Honey, come here.

505
00:29:33,224 --> 00:29:36,223
This is Jennifer and Nick,
they're dear friends of mine.

506
00:29:36,313 --> 00:29:39,773
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.

507
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:41,813
Okay, Sammy.

508
00:29:41,903 --> 00:29:44,773
After we ate,
we left Jennifer and Ginger alone...

509
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:47,032
and we took a ride to talk.

510
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:49,072
And then, he hit me with it.

511
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:51,872
What do you think about me
moving out here?

512
00:29:53,452 --> 00:29:55,412
What's the matter?
You got a problem with that?

513
00:29:55,452 --> 00:29:59,581
- No, of course not.
- You mean, I have your permission?

514
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:02,461
Sure, you have my permission.
But I just gotta tell you...

515
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,461
it's no joke out here,
it's no joke.

516
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,591
You gotta keep a low profile.

517
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,470
It's not like back home. Right off
the bat, they don't like guys like us.

518
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,970
And this sheriff's
a real cowboy.

519
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,970
Even the coppers aren't afraid
to bury people out in the desert here.

520
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,600
I don't care. I wanna get away
from back home for a while.

521
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,639
I'm tired of that shit
back there.

522
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:21,639
Look at this place.
It's made of money.

523
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:25,149
You know what the best part is?
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.

524
00:30:25,184 --> 00:30:28,069
There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.

525
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:30,279
Nick, I gotta tell you.
I got pinched twice for no reason.

526
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,278
I really gotta be careful.

527
00:30:32,358 --> 00:30:34,528
I'm running a licensed place,
everything's legit.

528
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:37,328
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.

529
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:40,498
I'm especially not gonna
involve you in anything.

530
00:30:42,617 --> 00:30:45,287
Ace saw Vegas one way...

531
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:48,547
- You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
- Of course.

532
00:30:48,627 --> 00:30:51,377
But I saw it another.

533
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:53,836
I saw it as untouched.

534
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:55,846
I mean, they had bookies, pimps...

535
00:30:55,926 --> 00:30:57,966
and drug dealers
I could shake down.

536
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,966
Who the fuck
were they gonna run to?

537
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:01,936
So I started gettin'
everybody in line.

538
00:31:02,016 --> 00:31:04,685
Best of all,
for the first time in my life...

539
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:07,225
I figured out a way
not to lose.

540
00:31:07,355 --> 00:31:09,565
Yeah, he had
a foolproof scheme, all right.

541
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:11,645
It wasn't very scientific,
but it worked.

542
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:13,655
When he won, he collected;

543
00:31:13,695 --> 00:31:16,364
when he lost, he told the bookies
to go fuck themselves.

544
00:31:16,404 --> 00:31:19,824
What were they gonna do,
muscle Nicky?

545
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:22,404
- Hey, how you doin'?
- How you doin'?

546
00:31:22,534 --> 00:31:24,664
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?

547
00:31:24,744 --> 00:31:26,834
Oh, Nicky. I thought
you was layin'.

548
00:31:26,914 --> 00:31:29,703
No, no, I'm takin'.
I was takin'.

549
00:31:29,743 --> 00:31:32,753
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

550
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:35,793
- I'm a little confused.
- You're a little confused?

551
00:31:35,883 --> 00:31:38,343
Maybe if I stick your fuckin'
face through this window...

552
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:40,382
you'll get unconfused.

553
00:31:40,462 --> 00:31:42,422
- Gimme the fuckin' money.
- I'm sorry, Nick.

554
00:31:42,472 --> 00:31:44,382
I didn't mean anything by it.

555
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:47,052
That's why you had it ready.
You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?

556
00:31:47,182 --> 00:31:50,771
- My fuckin' head.
- Smarten up.

557
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:53,601
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up
and tell us about our first president.

558
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:00,531
George Washington was born...

559
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:03,450
But still,
it was nice and quiet for a while.

560
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,030
Ginger and I presented
Nicky and Jennifer all over town...

561
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,450
like regular Ozzie and Harriets.

562
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,450
Beautiful, you got
a beautiful swing.

563
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,119
Ace got my son, little Nicky,
involved in Little League.

564
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:16,919
Turned out to be one
of the other coaches...

565
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:19,129
was a fuckin'
metro intelligence cop.

566
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:22,259
But it didn't matter.
It was all about the kids.

567
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:23,629
He's gotta realize that everything
can't be a home run that he does.

568
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:26,718
That's exactly what
I keep tellin' him...

569
00:32:26,968 --> 00:32:29,298
but that's the kind of kid he is.

570
00:32:30,218 --> 00:32:32,468
And Nicky being Nicky,
he made his presence known.

571
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:36,017
Especially at the casino,
where he definitely did not work...

572
00:32:36,097 --> 00:32:38,437
people got the message.

573
00:32:38,477 --> 00:32:40,437
Me, that's why
the bosses sent me out here.

574
00:32:40,477 --> 00:32:43,067
They wanted me to make sure none
of the other crews robbed the joint.

575
00:32:43,107 --> 00:32:45,697
Like these two fuckin'
balloon heads over here.

576
00:32:45,777 --> 00:32:48,526
They were gonna try to bang us
out of 200 fuckin' grand...

577
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:50,526
- yeah, right, I'm sure.
- Hey! How are you?

578
00:32:50,616 --> 00:32:52,536
How are you?
What are you doing here?

579
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:54,656
I'm over here now.

580
00:32:54,746 --> 00:32:57,166
- You're over here?
- Yeah, I'm over here with them.

581
00:33:00,335 --> 00:33:02,585
We're waiting on Carmine.

582
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:04,585
Yeah, we're looking
for Carmine.

583
00:33:04,665 --> 00:33:08,255
He was here before. He had
a suitcase and then he left.

584
00:33:08,335 --> 00:33:12,594
- Carmine left?
- Carmine left?

585
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:14,594
He's gone?

586
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:16,594
He's not here?

587
00:33:19,184 --> 00:33:21,143
Carmine's out?

588
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:23,393
I think maybe he went
across the street...

589
00:33:23,473 --> 00:33:25,683
or somewhere else
or somethin'.

590
00:33:28,193 --> 00:33:31,443
Well, listen, good luck
with the joint.

591
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:33,532
- Ah, thanks, Eddie.
- Yeah, lots of luck.

592
00:33:33,572 --> 00:33:36,742
- Yeah, good luck to you too.
- Hey, they forgot to sign their papers.

593
00:33:36,822 --> 00:33:40,242
Yeah, they don't
need those anymore.

594
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:43,742
Guys from other crews
got away with a warning.

595
00:33:43,777 --> 00:33:46,541
Everybody else, watch out.

596
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:49,001
Like these yokels here...

597
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:51,546
who never heard of Nicky
or the bosses back home.

598
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:53,551
'Cause they're the morons
who give you the most trouble.

599
00:33:53,591 --> 00:33:55,550
Even after we'd catch them,
they'd try sneaking back...

600
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,510
with beards
and wigs and fake noses.

601
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,350
You can spot these assholes
by watching the way they bet.

602
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,560
Like this guy,
he's bettin' lavender chips...

603
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,559
at 500 each with only
one little problem...

604
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:11,099
he's always guessed right.

605
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,609
If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy,
he'd have been tougher to spot.

606
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:18,948
But in the end,
they're all greedy.

607
00:34:23,948 --> 00:34:27,538
# I got a feelin'
about the future #

608
00:34:27,578 --> 00:34:29,907
# And it ain't too good
I know that #

609
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:39,627
I saw that the dealer was weak,
but he wasn't in on it.

610
00:34:39,717 --> 00:34:42,086
He just wasn't
protecting his hand.

611
00:34:42,136 --> 00:34:44,296
He was lifting
his hole card way too high.

612
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,735
Now, here's this guy reading
the dealer's hole card...

613
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:05,064
and signaling his buddy
at this table.

614
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,874
And that's just what
these hustlers look for.

615
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:16,993
They cruise from casino to casino
looking for weak dealers...

616
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:20,043
the way lions
look for weak antelope.

617
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:25,923
Operator, this is Mr. R.

618
00:35:25,963 --> 00:35:28,712
Get me Armstrong and Friday
over at pit two right away.

619
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:49,110
BJ 19, second base, the beard.

620
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,530
Operator, I need Mr. Happy. Loud.

621
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:01,249
# Happy birthday to you #

622
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:05,879
# Happy birthday, dear Jeff #

623
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:09,839
# Happy birthday to you #

624
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,147
Man down!

625
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:35,486
Go get medical.
We got a cardiac arrest here.

626
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:37,986
He's fine, folks.
Just give us some room, please.

627
00:36:41,486 --> 00:36:44,156
They never know
what hit them.

628
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:45,616
And if and when
they do find out...

629
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:48,415
that they just got zapped
by a cattle prod...

630
00:36:48,455 --> 00:36:51,585
they wish they really did
have a heart attack.

631
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:55,585
Turns out this guy
and his fuckin' pals...

632
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:58,544
they were knocking
this place dead for years.

633
00:36:58,594 --> 00:37:01,134
- He's got a wire on him.
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

634
00:37:01,214 --> 00:37:03,474
There it is.
That's it.

635
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,474
- Cheater's justice.
- Oh, God!

636
00:37:06,554 --> 00:37:09,603
No, no, no!

637
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:12,023
I wanted everybody to know...

638
00:37:12,103 --> 00:37:14,313
that things were changed
around here.

639
00:37:14,393 --> 00:37:16,393
We had to make an example
of these pricks...

640
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,403
that the party was over.

641
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:20,822
I'm just curious.
I saw you shuffling your checks...

642
00:37:20,902 --> 00:37:23,112
with your right hand.

643
00:37:23,152 --> 00:37:25,152
- Can you do that with both hands?
- No.

644
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:27,612
- You can't do it with both hands?
- No, sir.

645
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,912
Can you do it
with your left hand?

646
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:32,371
Well, I never tried.

647
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:35,371
- So, you're a righty.
- Yeah.

648
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,470
Now you're gonna have to learn
with your left hand.

649
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,430
- It's 100, 110, I think.
- Yes, it is.

650
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,470
Okay.

651
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:57,809
Hiya. That's a lot of money
to be counting out in public.

652
00:37:57,849 --> 00:38:00,609
Why don't I take him...

653
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:03,019
over to the office
and verify it?

654
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:05,109
A little privacy.
And by the way...

655
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,148
send over a nice bottle
of champagne on ice.

656
00:38:07,238 --> 00:38:09,158
- Sure will.
- Real special.

657
00:38:09,238 --> 00:38:11,948
- By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.
- Hi.

658
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:14,038
- Having a good time?
- Yes.

659
00:38:14,118 --> 00:38:16,578
You want to count
the money in privacy.

660
00:38:16,658 --> 00:38:19,667
I have a plane to catch to Cleveland.
Can I get my winnings?

661
00:38:22,457 --> 00:38:24,377
Look what they did
to my hand, man.

662
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:29,506
All right,
I'm gonna give you a choice:

663
00:38:29,546 --> 00:38:33,386
You can either have the money and
the hammer or you can walk out of here.

664
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:35,636
- What do you want?
- I just wanna get out of here.

665
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:38,936
And don't forget to tell your friends
what happens if they fuck around here.

666
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:42,605
- I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.
- You're fuckin' right you made a bad mistake.

667
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:44,935
'Cause if you come back here,
and we catch either one of you...

668
00:38:44,975 --> 00:38:46,735
we're gonna break your heads,
and you won't walk out of here.

669
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:51,194
You see that fuckin' saw?
We're gonna use it. You got it?

670
00:38:51,234 --> 00:38:54,154
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.

671
00:38:54,194 --> 00:38:57,034
Throw him in the alley and tell
the cops he got hit by a car.

672
00:38:57,494 --> 00:38:59,244
Within no time,
everything was set in place.

673
00:38:59,284 --> 00:39:01,244
We got rid
of the freelance scamsters...

674
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:04,703
the per was way up,
the gods were happy.

675
00:39:04,783 --> 00:39:07,873
And I decided
to complicate my life.

676
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:10,123
For a guy who likes sure things...

677
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:12,753
I was about to bet the rest
of my life on a real long shot.

678
00:39:12,923 --> 00:39:15,042
We're not gettin' any younger.

679
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:17,262
Don't you think it's time?

680
00:39:17,382 --> 00:39:19,972
Aren't you gettin' tired
of all this shit?

681
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:22,142
What, are you trying
to handicap me?

682
00:39:22,262 --> 00:39:24,932
I'm gonna do you one better.

683
00:39:24,972 --> 00:39:27,561
I'm tryin' to marry you.

684
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:29,731
You wanna marry me?

685
00:39:29,811 --> 00:39:31,731
I'm serious.

686
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:37,440
I wanna settle down.
I want a family.

687
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,450
You got the wrong girl, Sam.

688
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,660
I know I'd be a good father,
you'd be a good mother.

689
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,660
You don't know me.

690
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,740
You've known me two,
three months.

691
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,289
I'm 43 years old.
I don't want to wait.

692
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:53,169
I know you well enough
to know that I really love you.

693
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:55,879
And I can't think
of anybody better to be with.

694
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:58,959
And I don't feel like
waiting anymore.

695
00:40:00,218 --> 00:40:02,838
You know a lot of happily
married people, Sam?

696
00:40:02,928 --> 00:40:05,298
'Cause I don't.

697
00:40:05,388 --> 00:40:07,638
Yeah, I know all that.

698
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:13,977
I care about you, okay.

699
00:40:14,057 --> 00:40:16,767
But I just don't have those kind
of feelings for you.

700
00:40:19,027 --> 00:40:23,986
I'm sorry.
I'm not in love with you.

701
00:40:24,026 --> 00:40:26,906
- All right, all right.
- Understand?

702
00:40:28,986 --> 00:40:30,866
Sam, I'm sorry.

703
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:33,575
No, I... I...

704
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:37,625
I mean... I can grow.

705
00:40:37,665 --> 00:40:41,875
As long as there's a mutual respect,
that kind of thing can grow.

706
00:40:41,915 --> 00:40:44,505
I'm realistic.
I can accept that.

707
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:47,884
What is love anyway?

708
00:40:47,964 --> 00:40:50,594
It's a mutual respect.
It's a devotion.

709
00:40:50,674 --> 00:40:53,934
It's a caring
from one person to another.

710
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:56,933
And if we could set up
some kind of foundation...

711
00:40:57,013 --> 00:41:00,183
based on that mutual respect...

712
00:41:00,273 --> 00:41:03,233
I feel eventually you
would care enough about me...

713
00:41:03,313 --> 00:41:05,733
that I could live
with that.

714
00:41:08,522 --> 00:41:11,532
If it doesn't work out,
doesn't play out...

715
00:41:11,572 --> 00:41:14,452
then what happens to me?

716
00:41:14,532 --> 00:41:16,452
You know I'm doing well now,
and I'm gonna do even better.

717
00:41:16,532 --> 00:41:18,871
And so whatever happens...

718
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:20,871
if it doesn't work out
between us...

719
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,411
I'm gonna make sure you're okay
for the rest of your life.

720
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:26,171
And if there are kids,
especially...

721
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:28,421
I'll take care of you
better than you'd ever imagine.

722
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:30,880
What are you pitching me?

723
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,760
Just what I said,
you'll be set up...

724
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,720
for the rest of your life,
that I can promise you.

725
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,559
Want to take a chance?

726
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:55,448
When I married Ginger,
I knew all the stories.

727
00:41:55,528 --> 00:41:58,108
But I didn't give a fuck.
I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.

728
00:41:58,198 --> 00:42:01,028
I can change her.

729
00:42:02,038 --> 00:42:03,948
It was typical Ace.

730
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:06,957
He invited the biggest people
in town, and he knew they'd show.

731
00:42:06,997 --> 00:42:09,457
Because he knew they all wanted
somethin' from him.

732
00:42:09,497 --> 00:42:12,957
With Ace, nobody ever got
a free ride, even Ginger.

733
00:42:13,047 --> 00:42:15,087
With her, he still
covered his bets.

734
00:42:15,127 --> 00:42:17,466
They had to have the baby
before they could get married.

735
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:19,466
He even made Jenny and me
watch Amy for a few days...

736
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:22,096
when they went
on their honeymoon.

737
00:42:22,136 --> 00:42:24,766
But I didn't mind,
we loved the kid.

738
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:31,555
Can you feel my eyes on you?

739
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:34,895
Can you feel me
look into your heart?

740
00:42:35,025 --> 00:42:37,895
Can you feel me
in the pit of your stomach?

741
00:42:40,654 --> 00:42:43,114
Can you feel me in you?

742
00:42:43,154 --> 00:42:45,404
In your heart?

743
00:42:48,284 --> 00:42:50,913
Don't make me come there.

744
00:42:50,993 --> 00:42:52,783
Answer me.

745
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:54,793
I love you.

746
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,623
But, baby, do you know
that I love you too?

747
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,133
- No, Lester.
- Do you know that?

748
00:43:00,173 --> 00:43:04,172
This is the best thing I can do
for my life right now.

749
00:43:04,302 --> 00:43:06,672
That's right.
So it's going to be okay.

750
00:43:06,722 --> 00:43:09,342
Promise?

751
00:43:09,382 --> 00:43:11,642
I wish you all the luck
in the world.

752
00:43:11,682 --> 00:43:13,186
You do?

753
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:16,851
Yeah, I do. It's the best thing
you can do right now.

754
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:19,391
I mean this.

755
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:21,981
You have real security.

756
00:43:22,021 --> 00:43:25,360
Sweetheart, you're gonna be
situated just right, in Vegas.

757
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,900
Come on. This is great for us.

758
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:31,360
I'm always gonna be here for you.

759
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,530
I ain't going no place.

760
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,789
I'm lookin' at you right now.

761
00:43:35,909 --> 00:43:38,619
I'm seein' you for the very first time,
right this minute.

762
00:43:38,709 --> 00:43:40,619
I can feel my heart click.

763
00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:43,879
I see you 14 years old.

764
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:46,419
I see you the first second
I ever saw you.

765
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:49,918
I see you,
long-legged little colt...

766
00:43:50,048 --> 00:43:52,298
stupid braces on your teeth.

767
00:43:52,388 --> 00:43:55,678
- Okay, then.
- Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.

768
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,177
Talk to you later.

769
00:43:58,217 --> 00:44:00,137
Bye.

770
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,727
You all right?

771
00:44:06,817 --> 00:44:09,816
Yeah.

772
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:12,486
Why are you crying?

773
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:15,026
I'm not crying.

774
00:44:19,906 --> 00:44:22,495
Maybe you shouldn't
drink so much.

775
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,415
I'm okay, I just...

776
00:44:28,505 --> 00:44:30,665
You just have to understand.

777
00:44:30,755 --> 00:44:34,384
I've been with Lester
since I was a kid.

778
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:38,884
I just wanted to say good-bye.

779
00:44:39,014 --> 00:44:42,844
I just... I don't...

780
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:45,183
I think I have
a right to do that.

781
00:44:47,683 --> 00:44:49,643
Okay?

782
00:44:49,683 --> 00:44:52,313
It's all right.

783
00:44:52,353 --> 00:44:55,402
That part of your life
is over with.

784
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:58,152
- Right?
- Yeah.

785
00:44:58,192 --> 00:45:01,032
You're with me now.

786
00:45:01,112 --> 00:45:02,992
- Yeah.
- Right?

787
00:45:03,032 --> 00:45:05,742
Uh-huh.

788
00:45:05,782 --> 00:45:09,241
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

789
00:45:09,371 --> 00:45:12,831
Yeah.

790
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,460
- Let's go. Let's go back in.
- Okay.

791
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:36,649
Oh!

792
00:45:37,899 --> 00:45:41,858
Tsk. It's great.

793
00:45:44,528 --> 00:45:46,448
It's great.

794
00:45:50,658 --> 00:45:53,747
It's all my stuff.
Oh, my God.

795
00:45:53,827 --> 00:45:56,617
You brought all my stuff!

796
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:58,587
I can't...

797
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:02,507
Try it on. It's yours.

798
00:46:02,547 --> 00:46:05,336
You're kidding.

799
00:46:05,426 --> 00:46:08,636
Oh, my God.
What is it?

800
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:10,716
It's chinchilla.

801
00:46:10,756 --> 00:46:13,556
Oh, it's so soft.

802
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:17,185
Nice, isn't it?

803
00:46:19,895 --> 00:46:23,315
No one's ever been
so nice to me.

804
00:46:30,774 --> 00:46:33,784
Oh!

805
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:36,074
Oh, my God!

806
00:46:36,204 --> 00:46:38,623
So, do you think
it's too much...

807
00:46:38,703 --> 00:46:40,623
if I wear these
all on the same day?

808
00:46:40,663 --> 00:46:43,083
You do whatever
you want.

809
00:46:43,123 --> 00:46:45,623
Do I keep my promises or
do I keep my promises?

810
00:46:45,713 --> 00:46:48,632
So wonderful. The jewelry's
not so bad either.

811
00:46:48,712 --> 00:46:52,502
We shouldn't keep this in the house.
We gotta put it in the bank.

812
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:55,512
Come on. Can I keep this one
in the house?

813
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:58,512
Pay attention to me.

814
00:46:58,592 --> 00:47:01,601
- What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
- Okay.

815
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:03,721
All this stuff
doesn't mean anything.

816
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:06,391
Money, this doesn't mean
anything without trust.

817
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:08,981
I have to be able
to trust you with my life.

818
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,910
With over a million
in cash and jewels...

819
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:25,539
tucked in a bank in Vegas, only
for Ginger, she was secure and happy.

820
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,539
She loved that shit.

821
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:31,959
But a guy in my line of work has
to have a lot of payoff cash around.

822
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:34,378
Crooked cops and kidnappers,
they don't take checks.

823
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:37,008
Need any help with that,
Mr. Collins?

824
00:47:37,048 --> 00:47:39,588
So I put two million in cash
in a Los Angeles bank...

825
00:47:39,678 --> 00:47:42,348
under the name
of Mr. And Mrs. Tom Collins.

826
00:47:42,428 --> 00:47:45,308
This was strictly my shakedown
and kidnapping money.

827
00:47:50,307 --> 00:47:52,607
And since I'd either be in jail
or locked in a closet...

828
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:55,067
when I needed the money
the most...

829
00:47:55,187 --> 00:48:00,276
I gave Ginger the only key to the cash
that could get me back alive.

830
00:48:00,406 --> 00:48:03,026
- # I'll take you there #
- # I'm callin', callin' #

831
00:48:03,116 --> 00:48:05,326
# Callin' for mercy #

832
00:48:05,406 --> 00:48:09,615
- # I'll take you there #
- # Mercy, mercy #

833
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:12,535
# I'll take you there #

834
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:15,085
This is a signature card.

835
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,875
So once she signs those papers,
she'll be the only person...

836
00:48:17,915 --> 00:48:21,544
to have total access to the box,
no one else, including myself?

837
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:24,594
That's right.
That's the way you wanted it.

838
00:48:24,634 --> 00:48:27,634
Sam, let me ask you a question.

839
00:48:27,714 --> 00:48:29,924
You must really trust your wife.

840
00:48:32,763 --> 00:48:35,763
Yeah, sure I do. Why?

841
00:48:35,853 --> 00:48:37,853
It's good.
It's just unusual.

842
00:48:37,933 --> 00:48:40,103
Tell you the truth,
so many of my clients don't.

843
00:48:40,273 --> 00:48:44,442
- # Let me take you there #
- # I'll take you there #

844
00:48:44,482 --> 00:48:48,742
- # Ain't no smilin' faces #
- # I'll take you there ##

845
00:48:50,742 --> 00:48:56,371
# Never will I know happiness #

846
00:48:56,451 --> 00:49:00,291
With Ginger and the money
in place, I felt covered.

847
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:02,251
And to play it safe,
I switched job titles again...

848
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,501
and made myself
Food and Beverage Director.

849
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:07,710
This way nobody would bother me
about a license.

850
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,670
I mean Vegas was
like a dream for me.

851
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,720
Trouble was, Nicky was dreaming
his own kind of Vegas.

852
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,719
I put money out on the street
chargin' three points a week.

853
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:18,769
- Don't make us come lookin' for you.
- Juice to the fuckin' dealers.

854
00:49:18,809 --> 00:49:20,769
You won't have to look
for me.

855
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:22,769
I appreciate it.
Thanks, Nicky.

856
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:25,439
They were degenerate gamblers,
coke freaks.

857
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:29,318
In no time I had half the dealers
in the Tangiers in my pocket.

858
00:49:29,398 --> 00:49:33,608
Then, I started bustin' out
high-stakes poker players.

859
00:49:33,948 --> 00:49:35,908
It was so obvious.

860
00:49:35,948 --> 00:49:40,657
- All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics were
signal-happy. - I'm gonna open for 500.

861
00:49:40,697 --> 00:49:43,497
Signaling back and forth.

862
00:49:43,537 --> 00:49:46,627
Why you cryin'
with two loaves of bread under your arm?

863
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:49,167
Nicky thought nobody was watching him.
But he was wrong.

864
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:52,336
And I didn't want
any of those agents near my place.

865
00:49:52,376 --> 00:49:56,006
- Four aces.
- I can't believe this.

866
00:49:56,046 --> 00:49:59,506
If I didn't have
bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck.

867
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:03,225
I wished to God Nicky and
his whole crew would just get lost.

868
00:50:03,305 --> 00:50:06,185
What am I gonna do?
Go back home and start a war?

869
00:50:06,225 --> 00:50:08,975
Nicky's a made guy, and I'm not.
I can't do that.

870
00:50:09,015 --> 00:50:11,065
Be careful. Gaming agents
are all over the place.

871
00:50:11,145 --> 00:50:13,524
So I'm lucky. I'm not allowed
to get lucky in this place?

872
00:50:13,564 --> 00:50:16,694
You've been lucky all week.
They're looking to nail you.

873
00:50:16,734 --> 00:50:20,534
Ace was so fuckin' worried
about his casino...

874
00:50:20,614 --> 00:50:24,034
he forgot what we were doin'
out here in the first place.

875
00:50:24,074 --> 00:50:26,113
A million times I wanted to yell
in his fuckin' ear...

876
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:28,663
"This is Las Vegas.

877
00:50:28,703 --> 00:50:30,543
We're supposed to be
out here robbin'...

878
00:50:30,623 --> 00:50:33,163
you dumb fuckin' hebe. "

879
00:50:37,292 --> 00:50:39,212
I don't give a shit
who he's connected to.

880
00:50:39,292 --> 00:50:41,592
Tell him to take
his fuckin' feet off the table.

881
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:43,722
What's he think this is,
a goddamned sawdust joint?

882
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:48,931
Sir, would you mind
taking your feet off the table?

883
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:51,931
Yeah, I would mind.
I'm having a bad night.

884
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:55,561
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.

885
00:50:55,641 --> 00:50:57,561
Call security.

886
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,150
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

887
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:07,860
Wanna do me a favor? Take your feet off
the table and put your shoes back on.

888
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,820
Fuck you!

889
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,749
I want you to exit this guy
off the premises...

890
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:18,249
and use his head
to open the fucking door.

891
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:22,168
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
Wanna come with us outside?

892
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:25,088
Bullshit. I ain't goin'
anywhere with you.

893
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:27,428
- Bullshit. You're outta here.
- Fuck you!

894
00:51:27,508 --> 00:51:30,798
You know who you're
fucking with? Do you?

895
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:33,847
You fucking faggot! Do you know
who you're fucking with?

896
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:36,387
Leave me alone!

897
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:39,017
- Come on!
- You guys are killing me!

898
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:41,397
Sure enough, an hour later,
I get the call.

899
00:51:41,437 --> 00:51:45,356
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?

900
00:51:45,396 --> 00:51:47,566
No, I didn't know that.
But you know what he did?

901
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:50,866
I walked over to him politely,
and he tells me to fuck myself.

902
00:51:50,906 --> 00:51:53,736
- Then he called me a faggot.
- What?

903
00:51:53,786 --> 00:51:56,115
- I threw that cocksucker out.
- Hey, come here.

904
00:51:56,245 --> 00:51:58,955
You called my friend a faggot?
You tell him to fuck himself?

905
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:02,285
- Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?

906
00:52:02,455 --> 00:52:06,125
Come here. Come here.

907
00:52:06,295 --> 00:52:08,624
You go over there.
You apologize.

908
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:10,834
You better hope
he lets you back in.

909
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:13,964
If you get outta line again,
I'll smash your head so hard...

910
00:52:14,054 --> 00:52:17,014
you won't be able
to get that cowboy hat on.

911
00:52:17,094 --> 00:52:19,473
Fuckin' hick.
Sammy, listen.

912
00:52:19,593 --> 00:52:22,603
This guy obviously doesn't know
who he was talking to.

913
00:52:22,683 --> 00:52:25,183
He doesn't know that
we're dear friends.

914
00:52:25,313 --> 00:52:27,433
I mean, he's already
very sorry.

915
00:52:27,563 --> 00:52:30,312
But if you could do me a favor
and let him back in...

916
00:52:30,352 --> 00:52:32,692
I swear he'll never
get out of line again.

917
00:52:32,772 --> 00:52:35,112
If he does it again,
he's out for good.

918
00:52:35,192 --> 00:52:37,782
I don't care what it is,
I'll never let him in the place again.

919
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:39,862
I'm sorry about this, really.

920
00:52:39,992 --> 00:52:43,161
All right, Ace?
Thanks, pal.

921
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,951
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?

922
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:50,831
You shit-kickin',
stinky-horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker, you!

923
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:53,670
You fuck me up over there,
I'll stick you in the desert.

924
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,010
- Go over and apologize.
- Nicky, I'm sorry.

925
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:01,300
# You're dear to me
Yes, sirree #

926
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,929
You know,
Ace could be a very touchy guy.

927
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:06,219
Especially when
he got bigger in town.

928
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:09,429
Like when he hired that Jonathan and David
and their tigers away from the Palace...

929
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,189
by building them a new stage
and giving them a Rolls-Royce.

930
00:53:13,229 --> 00:53:16,018
But I'll tell you, he knew
how to bring in the crowds.

931
00:53:16,108 --> 00:53:18,188
He knew all
the fuckin' angles.

932
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,198
He brought over the whole
"Femme Fatale" show from Paris...

933
00:53:21,278 --> 00:53:24,278
but he forgot how lazy them
European dancing broads can get.

934
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:28,697
He had to weigh 'em in once a week to make
sure they didn't blow up like balloons.

935
00:53:28,787 --> 00:53:30,707
She's still eight pounds over.

936
00:53:30,787 --> 00:53:32,867
- What's the reason for this?
- Mr. Rothstein, sir.

937
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:36,207
Never mind the "sir. "
Why is she eight pounds over?

938
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:38,376
I'm trying to use respect.

939
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:40,916
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

940
00:53:41,046 --> 00:53:44,716
Well, sometimes when you put
that pressure point on them...

941
00:53:44,756 --> 00:53:47,886
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.

942
00:53:47,926 --> 00:53:51,765
I guess she's frightened. If she doesn't
lose weight she may get fired.

943
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:54,935
That's right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris...

944
00:53:54,975 --> 00:53:57,645
- It's been our policy...
- Just stop everything!

945
00:53:57,725 --> 00:53:59,935
- This woman's an institution.
- That's the problem. She's lazy.

946
00:53:59,985 --> 00:54:02,274
Hey,
I gotta give the guy credit.

947
00:54:02,354 --> 00:54:04,654
I mean, he does
the most obvious thing.

948
00:54:04,734 --> 00:54:08,074
This is the only town in the country
where a bookie joint is legit.

949
00:54:08,154 --> 00:54:10,404
So why not take advantage, right?

950
00:54:10,444 --> 00:54:13,073
So, he took bookie joints
off the street...

951
00:54:13,153 --> 00:54:15,873
and then opened them up
inside the casino.

952
00:54:15,913 --> 00:54:18,123
Within a few years
by doing all of this...

953
00:54:18,203 --> 00:54:20,873
he had every casino on the strip
trying to copy off of him.

954
00:54:20,913 --> 00:54:23,123
Between my innovations...

955
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:25,292
# Look like they're taking
some cat to jail #

956
00:54:25,382 --> 00:54:28,752
and Nicky's dedication
to his job...

957
00:54:28,882 --> 00:54:31,302
# Steamboats are comin' and
they're splashing and goin' #

958
00:54:31,337 --> 00:54:33,432
I soon had the best
operation on the strip.

959
00:54:33,512 --> 00:54:35,891
# Moon is shinin'
on friends below #

960
00:54:35,971 --> 00:54:39,971
You gotta watch yourself.
There's a lot of heat on you already.

961
00:54:40,061 --> 00:54:42,851
Why?
Somebody's complainin'?

962
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:45,021
I'm hearing things
from security.

963
00:54:45,061 --> 00:54:47,480
The sheriff's lookin'
to put you in the Black Book.

964
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,900
That Black Book
is a bunch of bullshit.

965
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,900
They got two names
from the whole country...

966
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,990
and one of 'em
is still Al Capone.

967
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:57,450
If they put you in that book,
you're gonna be in trouble.

968
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,779
You will not be able
to walk into a casino.

969
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:02,409
I'm trying to make a living,
that's all.

970
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:05,289
I'm just tellin' you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

971
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:07,289
All right.

972
00:55:11,498 --> 00:55:14,838
Mrs. Rothstein,
straight ahead. Very nice.

973
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,138
Thank you.

974
00:55:19,678 --> 00:55:22,142
For his hard work
and dedication...

975
00:55:22,177 --> 00:55:25,387
and the new life blood
he has instilled in Las Vegas...

976
00:55:25,517 --> 00:55:28,227
Sam has established himself
as an indispensable member...

977
00:55:28,307 --> 00:55:30,817
of the gaming community.

978
00:55:30,857 --> 00:55:33,146
As the head of the
Tangiers Gaming Corporation...

979
00:55:33,226 --> 00:55:35,696
it's my pleasure
to welcome Sam Rothstein...

980
00:55:35,776 --> 00:55:37,946
to the Vegas Valley
Country Club.

981
00:55:43,195 --> 00:55:47,075
Back home, they would've put me
in jail for what I'm doing.

982
00:55:47,165 --> 00:55:50,415
But out here,
they're giving me awards.

983
00:55:50,495 --> 00:55:54,874
It is with great pleasure that I accept
this certificate of appreciation...

984
00:55:54,914 --> 00:55:57,464
for charitable donations
to greater Las Vegas.

985
00:55:57,504 --> 00:55:59,754
Congratulations, sweetheart.

986
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:03,214
Sam raised more than
we've ever raised before.

987
00:56:03,304 --> 00:56:07,763
But my greatest pleasure was watching
my wife, Ginger, work the room.

988
00:56:07,843 --> 00:56:11,393
- They all loved her.
How could you not love her?

989
00:56:11,513 --> 00:56:14,063
She could be the most
charming woman you ever saw.

990
00:56:14,103 --> 00:56:16,103
People loved
to be around her.

991
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:19,102
You've got to bring Amy
to Sasha's birthday party.

992
00:56:19,272 --> 00:56:21,822
We'd love to have you there.

993
00:56:21,902 --> 00:56:23,862
- Yes, okay.
- Great.

994
00:56:23,942 --> 00:56:26,402
She made everybody feel good.

995
00:56:26,492 --> 00:56:30,821
# That's Stella by starlight #

996
00:56:30,951 --> 00:56:33,031
Congratulations, Sam.

997
00:56:33,121 --> 00:56:35,081
Oh, thanks.

998
00:56:35,121 --> 00:56:37,411
- Hello, Mrs. Rothstein. How are you?
- Hi.

999
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:42,670
You're one of the most
gorgeous women I've ever seen.

1000
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,420
You're a lucky man,
Mr. Rothstein.

1001
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,760
Thank you.
Thanks for that compliment.

1002
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,179
He was a young kid
from the casino.

1003
00:56:52,219 --> 00:56:54,469
Nice kid.
Bright boy.

1004
00:56:54,509 --> 00:56:57,849
What balls on this fuckin' kid!
The next day I fired him.

1005
00:56:57,929 --> 00:57:02,808
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.

1006
00:57:02,938 --> 00:57:06,528
Do you wanna see this one?
Ahhhh!

1007
00:57:06,608 --> 00:57:10,818
Daddy gave me all this jewelry
because he loves me so much.

1008
00:57:10,853 --> 00:57:13,658
- But as much as they loved her...
- Oh, fabulous!

1009
00:57:13,738 --> 00:57:16,157
They didn't know
what really moved her.

1010
00:57:16,197 --> 00:57:20,117
Look at this. Look at this.
Daddy gave me this...

1011
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:24,707
And with Ginger happy, I was able
to concentrate on what I knew best.

1012
00:57:24,787 --> 00:57:27,256
Loose machines are
right back over there.

1013
00:57:27,336 --> 00:57:30,376
What are they doin' back there?
You can't even see 'em there.

1014
00:57:30,506 --> 00:57:34,006
- Okay, I'll...
- What about the progressives with the high jackpots?

1015
00:57:34,096 --> 00:57:37,635
- Well...
- These are our best machines. They bring all the action.

1016
00:57:37,675 --> 00:57:39,845
- No wonder the drop is off.
- Yeah, okay.

1017
00:57:39,885 --> 00:57:42,845
- The action is in the front. Bring 'em up front.
- All right, I will.

1018
00:57:42,895 --> 00:57:45,895
Listen to me very carefully. There are
three ways of doing things around here:

1019
00:57:45,975 --> 00:57:48,734
The right way, the wrong way
and the way that I do it.

1020
00:57:48,814 --> 00:57:52,604
- You understand?
- I do understand that. I'll get right on it.

1021
00:57:52,694 --> 00:57:56,194
- And thank you.
- Don't thank me. Just do it.

1022
00:57:56,274 --> 00:57:59,444
You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.

1023
00:57:59,533 --> 00:58:02,783
Dang, you are right,
Mr. Rothstein. I am so sorry.

1024
00:58:02,863 --> 00:58:06,453
So I ended up working...
what, 18-hour days.

1025
00:58:06,533 --> 00:58:09,793
Ginger was the one who wound up
enjoying the best of Vegas.

1026
00:58:09,873 --> 00:58:13,042
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.

1027
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,792
What did you say to that
fucking jerk, anyway?

1028
00:58:15,882 --> 00:58:18,382
I told him I was
Mrs. Sam Rothstein.

1029
00:58:18,422 --> 00:58:21,762
Well, you might
as well get something out of it.

1030
00:58:24,141 --> 00:58:26,181
Well, it wasn't long...

1031
00:58:26,221 --> 00:58:28,811
before what I was afraid
was gonna happen happened.

1032
00:58:28,891 --> 00:58:32,811
Nicky managed to get himself banned
from every casino in Las Vegas.

1033
00:58:32,891 --> 00:58:36,820
And from then on, I couldn't be seen
talking to him anywhere in Vegas or near it.

1034
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,860
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

1035
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,820
"He will be ejected from
any casino in Las Vegas.

1036
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:48,079
And the casinos can be fined
as much as $100,000...

1037
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,584
every time he shows up. "

1038
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:53,919
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

1039
00:58:53,999 --> 00:58:57,458
"Because of notorious
and unsavory reputation... "

1040
00:58:57,538 --> 00:59:00,208
Motherfucker!

1041
00:59:00,258 --> 00:59:02,918
Is there any way
around this?

1042
00:59:03,008 --> 00:59:05,758
No, there's no way.

1043
00:59:05,798 --> 00:59:08,927
Let's say, for instance...

1044
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:12,517
I wanna go in a restaurant,
which happens to be in the casino...

1045
00:59:12,597 --> 00:59:14,517
to get one of those
sandwiches I like?

1046
00:59:14,597 --> 00:59:18,267
Forget it. You can't even
set foot in the parking lot.

1047
00:59:18,357 --> 00:59:20,776
That's how serious it is.

1048
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:24,146
In other words,
I'm fucked?

1049
00:59:24,236 --> 00:59:26,616
In so many words, yes.

1050
00:59:26,736 --> 00:59:30,825
It just didn't sink into his head
about the Black Book and what it meant.

1051
00:59:30,905 --> 00:59:33,825
Not being able to go
into a casino is one thing...

1052
00:59:33,905 --> 00:59:38,495
but being in this book etched your name
into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.

1053
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:42,294
I mean, you're listed in there
with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.

1054
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:45,964
I gotta do something.
They ain't gettin' rid of me.

1055
00:59:46,004 --> 00:59:48,754
They're not gettin' rid of me.
I'm stayin' here.

1056
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:51,254
Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.

1057
00:59:55,473 --> 00:59:58,093
So, once they pulled that shit...

1058
00:59:58,143 --> 01:00:01,313
I started doin' my own things
nobody ever thought of doin'.

1059
01:00:01,353 --> 01:00:06,312
To keep an eye on things, I brought in my
kid brother, Dominick, and some desperados...

1060
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,312
and started knockin' over
high-rollers, casino bosses...

1061
01:00:09,362 --> 01:00:12,152
bookmakers...
anybody right here in town.

1062
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:14,862
I had a good fuckin' crew goin'
for me, I'll tell you that.

1063
01:00:14,952 --> 01:00:18,626
I had Sal Fusco,
a great second-story guy.

1064
01:00:18,661 --> 01:00:23,621
Jack Hardy. He worked for a safe company
before he did a six-year bit.

1065
01:00:23,701 --> 01:00:28,460
And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy can bypass any alarm for me.

1066
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:31,170
It was like old times.

1067
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:35,800
And I opened up my own jewelry
store too, the "Gold Rush. "

1068
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,299
Sometimes I used to go along
on a heist, just for the fun of it.

1069
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:42,309
But I didn't like the people
I was rippin' off looking at me...

1070
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,139
so I used to turn
their fuckin' pictures around.

1071
01:00:45,229 --> 01:00:48,139
- What's takin' so long?
- This is a motherfucker!

1072
01:00:48,229 --> 01:00:52,438
- It's working.
- Learn how to open these things so you don't have to take 'em.

1073
01:00:52,518 --> 01:00:55,358
Some of these stones
got a lot of niggers in them.

1074
01:00:55,398 --> 01:00:58,908
Tell Pepe if he's switching stones on us,
he better take a camel back to Nigeria.

1075
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,278
Yeah?

1076
01:01:01,368 --> 01:01:03,617
- They're in Penthouse K.
- Check in alone?

1077
01:01:03,697 --> 01:01:05,747
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?

1078
01:01:05,867 --> 01:01:08,747
- Yes. Don't worry.
- All right. Thanks.

1079
01:01:08,787 --> 01:01:11,537
He had tipsters
all over town. Bellmen.

1080
01:01:11,577 --> 01:01:14,296
- But you got to hurry.
- Yeah, okay.

1081
01:01:14,376 --> 01:01:16,456
- Valet parkers.
- They're just checking in now.

1082
01:01:16,546 --> 01:01:18,466
Okay, I'll tell him.

1083
01:01:18,546 --> 01:01:20,466
- Pit bosses.
- Room 1230 at the Scirocco.

1084
01:01:20,546 --> 01:01:22,466
- 1230. Right.
- Secretaries.

1085
01:01:22,546 --> 01:01:25,765
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition? All right.

1086
01:01:25,885 --> 01:01:27,175
And they all got
a piece of the score.

1087
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:30,095
Car's coming.

1088
01:01:33,265 --> 01:01:35,395
They were very careful.

1089
01:01:35,435 --> 01:01:38,024
They always bypassed
the alarms, or else...

1090
01:01:38,104 --> 01:01:42,564
if not, they'd drill enough holes to knock
through the walls with a sledgehammer.

1091
01:01:43,774 --> 01:01:45,904
Nicky was grabbing
everything he could.

1092
01:01:45,944 --> 01:01:49,703
Nobody out there was expecting
a guy like him.

1093
01:01:51,113 --> 01:01:53,833
For Nicky, Las Vegas
was the fucking wild west.

1094
01:01:53,913 --> 01:01:56,373
I just got a shipment
of diamonds from Israel.

1095
01:01:56,453 --> 01:02:00,332
What the fuck they expect
from me? I had to earn, didn't I?

1096
01:02:00,422 --> 01:02:02,752
You know, this diamond
has flaws in it.

1097
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:06,302
- There's no flaws.
- I'm doing this for 25 years.

1098
01:02:06,382 --> 01:02:09,672
You better clean your loupe,
because there's no flaws.

1099
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:12,261
Whenever we got local merch...

1100
01:02:12,301 --> 01:02:15,431
we'd usually send it
to Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.

1101
01:02:15,471 --> 01:02:18,101
I had a couple of sand niggers
out there. You know, Arabs.

1102
01:02:18,141 --> 01:02:20,731
What, are you gonna have
a fucking meeting here?

1103
01:02:20,811 --> 01:02:22,940
I know his language.

1104
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,980
Forty thousand dollars.
The whole package.

1105
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:27,820
Twenty thousand.
That's my final offer.

1106
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:31,490
He suddenly talks English. Let's talk
Turkey here. Twenty-five thousand.

1107
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:34,489
I actually turned
my bedroom into a bank vault...

1108
01:02:34,529 --> 01:02:37,039
where I kept
the choice stuff.

1109
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:40,539
I couldn't leave it
at the Gold Rush...

1110
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:42,829
in case we got raided
by the cops...

1111
01:02:42,919 --> 01:02:44,828
or if my crew got cute.

1112
01:02:44,878 --> 01:02:47,878
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.

1113
01:02:47,918 --> 01:02:50,878
She used to fall asleep
on the couch watching TV.

1114
01:02:50,918 --> 01:02:54,548
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.

1115
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:57,887
Actually, I couldn't, because I wasn't
even supposed to be doin' it.

1116
01:02:57,927 --> 01:03:00,887
The bosses were making so much
fucking money with the casinos...

1117
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:04,187
that they didn't want anybody
makin' any waves for them.

1118
01:03:04,227 --> 01:03:06,896
You gave all the guys
in your crew a piece of that?

1119
01:03:06,936 --> 01:03:08,896
- I took care of everybody.
- Yeah?

1120
01:03:08,936 --> 01:03:13,406
That's why there was no real organized
street stuff in Vegas before I came here.

1121
01:03:13,486 --> 01:03:16,406
But how much cash
could I bury in my closet?

1122
01:03:16,446 --> 01:03:18,865
You have to understand,
and I'm sure you do...

1123
01:03:18,905 --> 01:03:21,075
that in a venture
of this kind...

1124
01:03:21,115 --> 01:03:23,540
you have to be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

1125
01:03:23,575 --> 01:03:27,705
So I put some of the money into legitimate
deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.

1126
01:03:27,785 --> 01:03:31,504
You will try to push it through,
won't you, Mr. Clark?

1127
01:03:31,544 --> 01:03:34,254
- Yes.
- I'm giving you 50,000 cash.

1128
01:03:34,334 --> 01:03:37,754
Then I put some more money into
legitimate places, like my restaurant.

1129
01:03:37,844 --> 01:03:39,754
- Is that the last one?
- Yeah.

1130
01:03:39,844 --> 01:03:43,223
I had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it for me.

1131
01:03:43,263 --> 01:03:45,223
Fuckers.

1132
01:03:49,063 --> 01:03:51,063
- Here you go, guys.
- All right.

1133
01:03:51,143 --> 01:03:53,522
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah. Enjoy. Have a good time.

1134
01:03:53,602 --> 01:03:55,602
Choke on it, motherfucker.

1135
01:03:55,652 --> 01:03:57,692
- Hey, Dom.
- How ya doin'?

1136
01:03:57,772 --> 01:04:01,362
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

1137
01:04:01,442 --> 01:04:04,361
And over the years,
he always made money with it.

1138
01:04:04,451 --> 01:04:07,781
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.

1139
01:04:07,871 --> 01:04:12,041
He had politicians, showgirls and movie
stars hanging out all over the place.

1140
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:14,461
That show over at the Flamingo
gets better and better.

1141
01:04:14,501 --> 01:04:17,960
By the way, Sammy said, whenever
you have a minute, give him a call.

1142
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,130
- Made a messenger out of you too, huh?
- Anything for a buck.

1143
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:24,050
- He does it to everybody. Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.

1144
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:27,759
But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky
liked most was the showgirls, naturally.

1145
01:04:27,799 --> 01:04:30,559
I mean, to them,
Nicky was the movie star.

1146
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:32,929
- You walk past me?
- Hey, this is Shelly.

1147
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,939
- Hey, Shelly. How are you?
- Hi.

1148
01:04:34,979 --> 01:04:37,099
- And this is Stacy.
- Stacy.

1149
01:04:37,229 --> 01:04:39,728
- This is Nick. Wanna have dinner?
- Pleasure.

1150
01:04:39,858 --> 01:04:43,318
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

1151
01:04:43,438 --> 01:04:46,278
Come on. I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.

1152
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:49,277
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

1153
01:04:49,367 --> 01:04:53,497
And you can always tell a great kitchen
like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

1154
01:04:53,617 --> 01:04:56,577
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

1155
01:04:56,667 --> 01:05:00,167
Out here they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

1156
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:04,006
Now, pink veal, you can pound
that shit for two days.

1157
01:05:04,086 --> 01:05:07,586
It'll never, ever get tender.
You know what I mean?

1158
01:05:07,716 --> 01:05:10,716
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

1159
01:05:10,796 --> 01:05:13,885
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.

1160
01:05:13,965 --> 01:05:16,015
- That's what I did.
- Yeah?

1161
01:05:16,135 --> 01:05:18,345
- Yeah.
- You call yourself a man?

1162
01:05:18,475 --> 01:05:23,184
You know you're a lyin' lowlife,
motherfuckin' gamblin' degenerate prick?

1163
01:05:23,224 --> 01:05:25,604
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.

1164
01:05:25,684 --> 01:05:27,854
I gave you money to pay
the fuckin' rent...

1165
01:05:27,944 --> 01:05:30,194
and buy groceries,
put the heat on.

1166
01:05:30,314 --> 01:05:33,614
Your wife called Frankie and
told him the fuckin' heat's off.

1167
01:05:33,694 --> 01:05:35,903
And you didn't gamble
that fuckin' money?

1168
01:05:35,943 --> 01:05:37,903
- No? You didn't?
- I didn't...

1169
01:05:37,993 --> 01:05:41,243
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck outta me.

1170
01:05:41,323 --> 01:05:44,833
You wanna embarrass me and make
a fool outta me? You didn't gamble?

1171
01:05:44,913 --> 01:05:47,212
Tell me you gambled
the fuckin' money...

1172
01:05:47,252 --> 01:05:50,132
I'll give you the fuckin' money
to put the fuckin' heat on!

1173
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,542
Did you gamble? Huh?

1174
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:57,971
Fuckin' degenerate.

1175
01:05:58,051 --> 01:06:00,841
Fuckin' kids at home.

1176
01:06:03,431 --> 01:06:06,351
Here. Get the fuck outta here.

1177
01:06:06,431 --> 01:06:08,441
- Thanks, Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1178
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,270
Let me find out you fucked up.
I'll leave you where I find you.

1179
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:13,570
How many of these
you gonna eat?

1180
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:15,570
- Two.
- Two?

1181
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:18,570
But around 6:30 in the morning,
when he finished his day...

1182
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:21,069
no matter where he was
or what he was doing...

1183
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:24,199
he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

1184
01:06:24,279 --> 01:06:27,119
I know you like this.
A little butter, right?

1185
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:29,919
- Not a lot. You know why, right?
- Yeah.

1186
01:06:29,959 --> 01:06:32,918
- Why?
- 'Cause it clogs up your heart.

1187
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:37,128
What a smart kid you are.
Okay, eat.

1188
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:39,968
Every couple of weeks,
I used to send Marino...

1189
01:06:40,048 --> 01:06:42,797
back to the bosses
with a piece of what I made.

1190
01:06:42,837 --> 01:06:45,177
Not a bit piece,
but what did they know?

1191
01:06:45,257 --> 01:06:48,477
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't
know anybody who can see that far.

1192
01:06:48,517 --> 01:06:50,597
Their drop was
a truck stop garage...

1193
01:06:50,637 --> 01:06:53,647
where Remo and the guys used
to hang out and count their millions.

1194
01:06:53,687 --> 01:06:55,646
- Remo.
- Hey, Frankie.

1195
01:06:55,686 --> 01:06:58,356
The cops knew,
but they didn't give a fuck.

1196
01:06:58,436 --> 01:07:00,526
Nicky sends
his warmest regards.

1197
01:07:00,606 --> 01:07:02,196
I knew how
to keep the bosses happy.

1198
01:07:02,236 --> 01:07:05,525
Whenever they gave me
little jobs to do...

1199
01:07:05,615 --> 01:07:08,945
I would carry things out
to a "T."

1200
01:07:08,995 --> 01:07:13,205
Like the time Tony Dogs, who's supposed
to be the new maniac tough guy in town...

1201
01:07:13,285 --> 01:07:15,705
shot up one of Remo's bars.

1202
01:07:19,964 --> 01:07:23,174
Here's a fuckin' guy
kills two of Remo's guys...

1203
01:07:23,294 --> 01:07:27,674
and a poor fuckin' waitress who was just
workin' on her night off, of all things.

1204
01:07:29,423 --> 01:07:33,183
I mean, this guy's just beggin'
to be made an example of.

1205
01:07:33,263 --> 01:07:36,973
Frankie, I want the names
of all the other people he had with him.

1206
01:07:37,013 --> 01:07:40,432
And I don't care what you have
to do to 'em to get 'em, understand?

1207
01:07:40,522 --> 01:07:42,602
- I'll take care of it, Remo.
- And mow 'em down.

1208
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:45,942
To be truthful with you,
I had to admire this guy.

1209
01:07:46,022 --> 01:07:48,862
He was one of the toughest
Irishmen I ever met.

1210
01:07:48,902 --> 01:07:51,401
This son of a bitch was tough.

1211
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:54,951
For two days and two fuckin' nights
we beat the shit outta this guy.

1212
01:07:55,031 --> 01:07:57,371
We even stuck ice picks
in his balls.

1213
01:07:57,411 --> 01:08:01,201
- Better give me a name soon, or I'm gonna give him yours, Frank.
- Thanks a lot.

1214
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:04,420
- But he never talked.
- I know you would've ratted by now.

1215
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:07,090
In the end, I had to put
his fuckin' head in a vise.

1216
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,920
Dogs, Dogs,
can you hear me, Dogs?

1217
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:12,920
Listen to me, Anthony.
I got your head in a vise.

1218
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:17,139
I'll squash your fuckin' head like a
grapefruit if you don't give me a name.

1219
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,509
Don't make me have to do this.
Please. Come on!

1220
01:08:19,559 --> 01:08:22,679
Don't make me be a bad guy.
Come on.

1221
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:25,228
Fuck you!

1222
01:08:25,308 --> 01:08:28,478
This motherfucker. You believe this?
Two fuckin' days and nights.

1223
01:08:28,568 --> 01:08:31,108
Fuck me? Fuck me?
You motherfucker!

1224
01:08:31,188 --> 01:08:34,028
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're tellin' me?

1225
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,987
You motherfucker, you! Huh?

1226
01:08:37,067 --> 01:08:40,447
- Oh, God!
- Give me the fuckin' name!

1227
01:08:40,537 --> 01:08:42,447
Charlie M.

1228
01:08:42,537 --> 01:08:44,457
- Charlie M.?
- Charlie M.

1229
01:08:44,497 --> 01:08:47,457
You make me pop your
fuckin' eye outta your head...

1230
01:08:47,497 --> 01:08:50,416
to protect that piece of shit,
Charlie M.?

1231
01:08:50,496 --> 01:08:52,456
You dumb motherfucker!

1232
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:54,666
Kill me, you fuck!
Kill me!

1233
01:08:54,796 --> 01:08:57,136
You motherfucker, you!

1234
01:08:57,256 --> 01:08:59,505
Frankie, do him
a fuckin' favor.

1235
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,095
The word got around
that finally...

1236
01:09:02,135 --> 01:09:05,095
there was a real
gangster in town.

1237
01:09:05,135 --> 01:09:07,225
Nicky was the new boss
of Las Vegas.

1238
01:09:07,305 --> 01:09:09,265
Charlie M.

1239
01:09:13,394 --> 01:09:16,694
Four reels, sevens,
across three $15,000 jackpots.

1240
01:09:16,774 --> 01:09:19,114
Do you have any idea
what the odds are?

1241
01:09:19,234 --> 01:09:21,654
It's gotta be
in the millions, maybe more.

1242
01:09:21,734 --> 01:09:24,993
Three fuckin' jackpots in 20 minutes!
Why didn't you call me?

1243
01:09:25,113 --> 01:09:28,623
It happened so quick. Three guys won.
I didn't have a chance.

1244
01:09:28,663 --> 01:09:32,453
- You didn't see the scam?
- There's no way to determine that.

1245
01:09:32,493 --> 01:09:34,702
Yes, there is.
They won!

1246
01:09:34,792 --> 01:09:37,872
It's a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.

1247
01:09:37,962 --> 01:09:41,382
Ward, you're pissing me off.
Now you're insulting my intelligence.

1248
01:09:41,462 --> 01:09:45,881
You know goddamn well somebody had to get into
those machines and set those fuckin' reels.

1249
01:09:45,971 --> 01:09:48,891
The probability on one machine
is a million and a half to one.

1250
01:09:48,971 --> 01:09:51,471
On three machines in a row,
it's in the billions.

1251
01:09:51,601 --> 01:09:53,721
What's the matter with you?

1252
01:09:53,811 --> 01:09:58,690
Didn't you see you were being set up
on the second win?

1253
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:01,020
I think you're overreacting.

1254
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:04,360
Listen, you fuckin' yokel. I've been
carrying your ass ever since I got here.

1255
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,859
- Get your ass outta here.
- You're firing me?

1256
01:10:07,949 --> 01:10:10,449
I'm firing you.
No, I'm not firing...

1257
01:10:10,529 --> 01:10:13,829
- You might regret this.
- I'll regret it if I keep you.

1258
01:10:13,869 --> 01:10:16,289
This is not the way
to treat people.

1259
01:10:16,369 --> 01:10:18,419
If you didn't know,
you're too fuckin' dumb.

1260
01:10:18,459 --> 01:10:19,828
If you did know,
you were in on it.

1261
01:10:19,868 --> 01:10:23,338
Either way, you're out.
Get out. Come on. Let's go.

1262
01:10:23,378 --> 01:10:26,418
The guy's history
as far as I'm concerned.

1263
01:10:26,508 --> 01:10:30,048
But you can't fire him. His
brother-in-law is County Commissioner.

1264
01:10:30,087 --> 01:10:35,267
Everybody with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county
commissioner or related to a commissioner.

1265
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:37,637
This is his state.
His uncle's chief judge.

1266
01:10:37,727 --> 01:10:40,097
His brother-in-law runs
the county commission.

1267
01:10:40,187 --> 01:10:43,106
You're in the finances,
you're upstairs.

1268
01:10:43,186 --> 01:10:46,026
But you are not on the floor.
You don't see what's going on.

1269
01:10:46,066 --> 01:10:48,946
I've got thousands of players.
I've got 500 dealers.

1270
01:10:49,026 --> 01:10:51,701
They're all looking
to rob me blind 24 hours a day.

1271
01:10:51,736 --> 01:10:55,405
I have to let them know I'm watching
all the details all the time.

1272
01:10:55,445 --> 01:10:59,115
There is not one single thing
I will not catch.

1273
01:10:59,205 --> 01:11:02,035
- Look at yours. Look at that.
- Huh?

1274
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:04,784
Look at this.
There's nothing.

1275
01:11:04,874 --> 01:11:07,334
Look how many blueberries
your muffin has.

1276
01:11:07,374 --> 01:11:09,834
What are you talking about?

1277
01:11:09,924 --> 01:11:12,294
If you don't do it yourself,
it never gets done.

1278
01:11:12,384 --> 01:11:15,963
- Where are you going?
- # How long can this go on #

1279
01:11:16,003 --> 01:11:20,183
From now on, I want you to put an equal
amount of blueberries in each muffin.

1280
01:11:20,263 --> 01:11:23,093
An equal amount of blueberries
in each muffin.

1281
01:11:23,183 --> 01:11:25,853
Do you know how long
that's going to take?

1282
01:11:25,933 --> 01:11:29,772
I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.

1283
01:11:33,772 --> 01:11:37,572
Just a little.
That a girl.

1284
01:11:37,652 --> 01:11:40,031
Oh, boy, look.
You wanna go to Mommy?

1285
01:11:40,151 --> 01:11:43,111
Wanna come to Mommy?
It's all right, sweetheart.

1286
01:11:43,161 --> 01:11:47,121
I need to talk to you.
I need some money.

1287
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:50,580
- What do you need?
- Got her?

1288
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:54,460
Well, I need a lot.
I need more than usual.

1289
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,840
Why don't you take it
out of your account?

1290
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:00,130
I would, you know, Sam,
it's just that...

1291
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:03,129
Well, I need more than that.
I need $25,000.

1292
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:07,349
Twenty-five thousand?
For yourself?

1293
01:12:07,469 --> 01:12:10,639
- Yeah.
- Why do you need that much?

1294
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:13,648
What's the difference?
I just need it.

1295
01:12:13,688 --> 01:12:15,728
Well, I gotta ask you.
That's a lot of money.

1296
01:12:15,808 --> 01:12:17,858
You're not asking
for a box of popcorn.

1297
01:12:17,898 --> 01:12:20,488
We don't have to turn this
into a big deal.

1298
01:12:20,528 --> 01:12:23,238
Okay? We don't have
to have a fight.

1299
01:12:23,318 --> 01:12:26,067
It's important to me.
Just something I wanted to do.

1300
01:12:26,157 --> 01:12:30,157
Who's fighting?
I mean, tell me what it's for.

1301
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:37,126
Why can't you tell me
what it's for? Huh?

1302
01:12:38,956 --> 01:12:42,006
Well, you know what?
Now I want you to tell me.

1303
01:12:42,046 --> 01:12:45,716
My wife comes to me and asks me
for 25,000. What do you want, a coat?

1304
01:12:45,796 --> 01:12:48,345
- No.
- If you want a coat, you got it.

1305
01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:52,805
It's not the money. It's just, why do you
want it? Am I not entitled to ask that?

1306
01:12:52,885 --> 01:12:57,015
Sam, I've been independent my whole life.
I never had to ask anybody for anything.

1307
01:12:57,105 --> 01:13:00,184
- Now you're making me beg.
- What are you talking about?

1308
01:13:00,224 --> 01:13:03,774
And you're embarrassing me.
Why do you want to make me feel so bad?

1309
01:13:03,854 --> 01:13:06,864
You're asking me for 25,000.
I'm not out to make you feel bad.

1310
01:13:06,984 --> 01:13:09,024
I want to just
be able to trust you.

1311
01:13:09,114 --> 01:13:11,033
You know,
it's about trust.

1312
01:13:11,113 --> 01:13:14,033
I have to be able
to trust you with my life.

1313
01:13:14,113 --> 01:13:17,203
Do you understand?

1314
01:13:17,283 --> 01:13:19,533
Can I trust you?

1315
01:13:22,582 --> 01:13:24,922
Can I trust you?

1316
01:13:26,172 --> 01:13:30,052
Can I trust you?
Answer me. Can I trust you?

1317
01:13:30,132 --> 01:13:32,091
You can trust me.

1318
01:13:32,131 --> 01:13:35,551
Good. So then you could tell me
what the money is for.

1319
01:13:39,351 --> 01:13:43,181
# You've got to #

1320
01:13:43,311 --> 01:13:46,140
# Give a little #

1321
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:49,690
# Take a little #

1322
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:54,240
# And let your poor heart #

1323
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,069
# Break a little #

1324
01:13:57,159 --> 01:13:59,819
Yeah, she's leaving the bank now.

1325
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:02,289
All right,
I'm gonna follow her.

1326
01:14:02,369 --> 01:14:04,464
What is that?

1327
01:14:04,499 --> 01:14:07,328
I know that look.
What does that look mean?

1328
01:14:07,368 --> 01:14:09,578
It means I got the money.

1329
01:14:09,668 --> 01:14:12,918
# You've got to #

1330
01:14:12,998 --> 01:14:16,878
- # Give a little #
- Yes, you're way up on top now.

1331
01:14:16,968 --> 01:14:19,137
# Take a little ##

1332
01:14:27,267 --> 01:14:30,896
How are you doin', Les?
It's Lester, right?

1333
01:14:30,976 --> 01:14:32,856
Sam.

1334
01:14:36,986 --> 01:14:40,655
From my recollection,
aren't you the card shark...

1335
01:14:40,695 --> 01:14:44,575
the golf hustler,
the pimp from Beverly Hills?

1336
01:14:46,575 --> 01:14:48,825
If I'm wrong,
please correct me.

1337
01:14:48,865 --> 01:14:51,535
'Cause I never knew you
to be a heist man.

1338
01:14:51,585 --> 01:14:53,954
But if you are,
you know what?

1339
01:14:54,044 --> 01:14:56,374
Here, take mine too.

1340
01:14:56,454 --> 01:14:59,754
Go ahead. Take it.
'Cause you already have hers.

1341
01:14:59,834 --> 01:15:03,213
She's my wife.
Look at me.

1342
01:15:03,303 --> 01:15:07,553
You did know that, didn't you?
You knew that she's my wife?

1343
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:10,553
- Hey, look at me.
- Yeah, I know that.

1344
01:15:10,643 --> 01:15:13,053
You know, yeah?

1345
01:15:14,892 --> 01:15:17,932
But if you ever
come back again, ever...

1346
01:15:18,022 --> 01:15:20,852
to take her money,
next time bring a pistol.

1347
01:15:20,902 --> 01:15:22,982
That way
you got a chance.

1348
01:15:23,062 --> 01:15:25,861
Be a man.
Don't be a fucking pimp.

1349
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:29,361
Now, you wanna do me a favor?
Get outta here.

1350
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:33,071
I wanna be alone with my wife.
Get up and get outta here.

1351
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:35,241
- And you want to be free.
- # Take a little #

1352
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:37,450
Why, you feel
that you are too good...

1353
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,420
much too good
for a nobody like me.

1354
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:44,210
- Fuckin' piece of shit.
- That's fuckin' bullshit.

1355
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,920
- # That's the story #
- Well, darling, I guess it's best...

1356
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:52,589
- # That's the glory of love #
- that we should part.

1357
01:15:52,639 --> 01:15:55,429
Remember when you called him
that night and said good-bye?

1358
01:15:55,469 --> 01:15:58,479
He didn't say, "Don't get married.
I'll be right down. "

1359
01:15:58,559 --> 01:16:01,388
- He didn't say that to you, did he?
- No, he didn't.

1360
01:16:01,438 --> 01:16:04,478
No. Instead, what did he say?

1361
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:09,068
"Fuck him. Take him
for everything he's got. "

1362
01:16:09,108 --> 01:16:12,697
Come here.
I want to show you something.

1363
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:18,447
- # That's the story #
- The second letter came right after I gave you your start.

1364
01:16:18,497 --> 01:16:22,577
No! No! No!

1365
01:16:22,616 --> 01:16:27,126
No! Make 'em stop it!

1366
01:16:27,246 --> 01:16:32,376
No! No!

1367
01:16:32,466 --> 01:16:35,795
It's not his fault!
It's my fault!

1368
01:16:43,185 --> 01:16:46,304
No!

1369
01:16:47,974 --> 01:16:51,314
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Piece of shit.

1370
01:16:59,993 --> 01:17:03,663
Do it yourself,
you chickenshit cocksucker!

1371
01:17:03,743 --> 01:17:05,743
He's such a prick!

1372
01:17:05,823 --> 01:17:08,832
He had some guy
from the hotel beat him up.

1373
01:17:08,872 --> 01:17:11,337
He didn't want
to do it himself.

1374
01:17:11,372 --> 01:17:14,462
Oh, no, he didn't want
to get his own hands dirty.

1375
01:17:14,502 --> 01:17:18,212
So why did he
have to do that, huh?

1376
01:17:18,302 --> 01:17:20,171
Tell me.

1377
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:23,091
- I know it wasn't a nice thing to do...
- No shit.

1378
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:27,551
You gotta understand it. He doesn't know
if this guy is shaking you down...

1379
01:17:27,641 --> 01:17:32,020
No. No. I told him all about this guy
before we ever got married.

1380
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:36,190
- This is no fucking surprise.
- Oh, you did? I didn't know that.

1381
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:40,030
He's just a friend of mine
I was trying to help. So what?

1382
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:43,949
You know, the first time
I ever saw you guys together...

1383
01:17:44,069 --> 01:17:46,359
I never saw him so happy.

1384
01:17:46,449 --> 01:17:49,909
I mean, I know he's
a crazy Jew fuck and everything...

1385
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:53,908
but I never seen him act
like that with anybody else.

1386
01:17:54,038 --> 01:17:57,878
I think he's crazy about you.
I mean, he really loves you.

1387
01:17:57,958 --> 01:18:01,708
Come on. I went into this
with my eyes open, you know.

1388
01:18:01,798 --> 01:18:04,258
I knew the bottom
could drop out at any time.

1389
01:18:04,338 --> 01:18:07,257
You don't think I'm gonna
go into a situation like this...

1390
01:18:07,337 --> 01:18:10,097
if I don't think I'm gonna
get covered on the back end.

1391
01:18:10,132 --> 01:18:12,387
- Sure, I can see that.
- Right?

1392
01:18:12,517 --> 01:18:16,646
So I put aside some jewelry for me.
A lot of jewelry.

1393
01:18:16,726 --> 01:18:19,726
You mean like a lot
of expensive jewelry? About how much?

1394
01:18:19,806 --> 01:18:22,436
You want to steal it?

1395
01:18:22,476 --> 01:18:25,446
No. I'm just curious.
I was wondering...

1396
01:18:25,486 --> 01:18:28,445
how much he would put
into a thing like that.

1397
01:18:28,485 --> 01:18:31,655
I'm told it's worth
about a million dollars, maybe more.

1398
01:18:31,735 --> 01:18:34,615
Well, there you go.
What does that tell you?

1399
01:18:34,695 --> 01:18:36,665
A million dollars in jewelry.

1400
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:38,995
Does that tell you
the guy is crazy about you?

1401
01:18:39,124 --> 01:18:43,084
I should've never married him.
He's a Gemini.

1402
01:18:43,164 --> 01:18:45,874
Triple Gemini. Duality.

1403
01:18:45,964 --> 01:18:49,464
Gemini is the snake, you know.
You can't trust a snake.

1404
01:18:49,504 --> 01:18:52,138
I mean it.

1405
01:18:52,173 --> 01:18:56,013
I know what you mean.
Listen, Ginger.

1406
01:18:56,053 --> 01:18:59,933
You know, this is probably not...
I don't have the answers anyway.

1407
01:18:59,973 --> 01:19:02,812
- This is probably not what you want to hear...
- I do.

1408
01:19:02,852 --> 01:19:06,022
'Cause you're a little upset,
and I understand that.

1409
01:19:06,102 --> 01:19:10,482
But I think you should try to make the
best of it now. Go slow. See what happens.

1410
01:19:10,522 --> 01:19:14,821
He could've killed him! Okay? He could've
killed him. He didn't have to hit him.

1411
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:17,821
It's not like
I'm sleeping with the guy.

1412
01:19:17,861 --> 01:19:20,661
He makes me sneak around to see
my own friends. What is that all about?

1413
01:19:20,701 --> 01:19:24,790
I guess it's 'cause he loves
you so much, he's jealous and worried.

1414
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:27,500
He gives a fuck what I do.

1415
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:31,380
Look, I'll try to find out
what the hell is going on.

1416
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:34,340
- When I see him, I'll talk to him.
- Okay.

1417
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,509
- All right?
- Yeah.

1418
01:19:36,549 --> 01:19:41,049
Thanks. Thanks
for putting up with me.

1419
01:19:41,089 --> 01:19:44,889
Take it easy with this shit.
This can only make matters worse.

1420
01:19:44,969 --> 01:19:49,188
You're a beautiful girl. I've seen a lot
of girls get shot to hell from this.

1421
01:19:49,268 --> 01:19:52,188
You're so nice.

1422
01:19:52,308 --> 01:19:56,858
Come on, now. I don't
wanna see you unhappy.

1423
01:19:56,898 --> 01:20:00,607
- # These eyes before us #
- Thanks.

1424
01:20:00,657 --> 01:20:03,367
# Just what the truth is #

1425
01:20:03,407 --> 01:20:05,697
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

1426
01:20:05,787 --> 01:20:08,407
# I can't say anymore #

1427
01:20:08,457 --> 01:20:12,626
# 'Cause I love you #

1428
01:20:12,706 --> 01:20:15,046
# Yes, I love you... ##

1429
01:20:18,876 --> 01:20:22,295
Mr. Rothstein, County Commissioner
Pat Webb is here to see you.

1430
01:20:22,385 --> 01:20:24,925
- Give me a minute.
- Okay. Just a minute.

1431
01:20:42,234 --> 01:20:44,733
Mr. Webb, can I
get you anything?

1432
01:20:44,823 --> 01:20:47,283
Uh, no. No, thank you,
little lady.

1433
01:20:47,323 --> 01:20:49,533
Okay, send him in.
Then call me four minutes after.

1434
01:20:49,573 --> 01:20:53,373
- Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.
- How do you do?

1435
01:20:53,453 --> 01:20:56,372
- Hey, it is a pleasure.
- I heard a lot about you.

1436
01:20:56,412 --> 01:20:59,832
Oh, thank you, sir.
Hey, house is doin' well.

1437
01:20:59,912 --> 01:21:02,462
Hey, all that money
is rollin' in.

1438
01:21:02,542 --> 01:21:05,792
I appreciate you takin' the time
to see a poor civil servant.

1439
01:21:05,882 --> 01:21:08,511
- Why don't you have a seat, hmm?
- Oh, thank you, sir.

1440
01:21:08,591 --> 01:21:11,971
I come here personally
to kind of smooth over...

1441
01:21:12,011 --> 01:21:14,641
any fracas
about a certain matter.

1442
01:21:14,721 --> 01:21:16,971
See, uh, maybe
you didn't know it...

1443
01:21:17,061 --> 01:21:19,930
but Don Ward is a very
well-liked man in this town.

1444
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:23,940
He's got lots of friends. Nice family
and their money go back many, many years.

1445
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:27,980
Now friends vote.
Family and money votes.

1446
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:30,989
That's important
to me and you.

1447
01:21:31,109 --> 01:21:35,569
And if you'll think about
our little problem along them lines...

1448
01:21:35,659 --> 01:21:38,539
and you'll forgive me
for sayin' it...

1449
01:21:38,659 --> 01:21:41,908
maybe he did not
deserve to be fired.

1450
01:21:42,038 --> 01:21:44,328
I'm sorry, but he knew
about our getting hit...

1451
01:21:44,418 --> 01:21:46,708
on three big machines in a row,
and he did nothing about it.

1452
01:21:46,788 --> 01:21:51,668
That means, either he was in on it or he
was too dumb to see what was goin' on.

1453
01:21:51,798 --> 01:21:54,717
Either way, I cannot have
a man like that working here.

1454
01:21:54,837 --> 01:21:57,507
Before we point the dirty
end of the stick at old Don...

1455
01:21:57,637 --> 01:22:00,387
we better be sure
we can prove them charges.

1456
01:22:00,427 --> 01:22:03,187
Believe me, if I could prove it,
he would be under arrest.

1457
01:22:03,267 --> 01:22:06,186
Are, uh...

1458
01:22:06,266 --> 01:22:10,026
Are we certain that you want
the Gaming Control Board...

1459
01:22:10,146 --> 01:22:13,896
eyeballing your record and
your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro.

1460
01:22:13,986 --> 01:22:16,695
I think you're way out of line
talking to me like that.

1461
01:22:16,735 --> 01:22:21,155
What you're saying is libelous, and you're
in no position to challenge my expertise.

1462
01:22:21,235 --> 01:22:24,535
I went way out of my way
to be very helpful to that kid.

1463
01:22:24,655 --> 01:22:28,074
He's weak. He's incompetent.
He jeopardizes the whole place.

1464
01:22:28,164 --> 01:22:30,294
There's not much more
I can do for him.

1465
01:22:30,374 --> 01:22:33,084
You have got me there.

1466
01:22:33,124 --> 01:22:36,424
Old Don is as useless
as tits on a boar.

1467
01:22:36,464 --> 01:22:40,383
But he is my brother-in-law...

1468
01:22:40,463 --> 01:22:43,223
and I would look on it
as a personal favor...

1469
01:22:43,263 --> 01:22:46,383
if you'd think some more
on hirin' him back.

1470
01:22:46,433 --> 01:22:48,643
I can't do that.

1471
01:22:48,723 --> 01:22:51,222
I appreciate the fact
that he's your brother-in-law...

1472
01:22:51,262 --> 01:22:54,062
and I do want to help you
and I like to do favors.

1473
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:57,062
I know who you are,
but I cannot do that.

1474
01:22:57,102 --> 01:23:01,191
Well, could there be
any position...

1475
01:23:01,271 --> 01:23:04,191
farther down the trough?

1476
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:08,111
I'm sorry.
I can't do anything.

1477
01:23:08,161 --> 01:23:12,370
He's too incompetent, and the bottom
line is, he cannot be trusted.

1478
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:17,500
Okay. Thanks.

1479
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:20,500
Well... you know,
that's it. I'm sorry.

1480
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:25,089
Mr. Rothstein, your people
never will understand...

1481
01:23:25,129 --> 01:23:27,509
the way it works out here.

1482
01:23:27,589 --> 01:23:30,719
You're all just our guests.

1483
01:23:30,799 --> 01:23:33,099
But you act
like you're at home.

1484
01:23:33,139 --> 01:23:37,098
Let me tell you something, partner.
You ain't home.

1485
01:23:37,138 --> 01:23:40,558
But that's where we're gonna send you
if it harelips the governor.

1486
01:23:42,978 --> 01:23:47,147
- Thank you for your time.
- No problem.

1487
01:23:47,237 --> 01:23:49,817
- Sorry.
- You bet.

1488
01:23:53,697 --> 01:23:56,037
What happened to my pills?

1489
01:23:56,117 --> 01:23:58,036
Huh?

1490
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:01,996
Isn't it bad enough you're drinking
too much? You're taking my pills too?

1491
01:24:02,086 --> 01:24:03,996
I didn't take your pills.

1492
01:24:04,086 --> 01:24:07,296
Look, for my ulcer,
I take a half a one of these.

1493
01:24:07,336 --> 01:24:09,505
And that's when I have
extreme pain.

1494
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:13,175
I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with 'em?

1495
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:15,885
You didn't have to beat him up.

1496
01:24:16,015 --> 01:24:17,925
What?

1497
01:24:18,015 --> 01:24:20,304
I was just trying to help him.

1498
01:24:20,344 --> 01:24:22,974
Like I'm sleeping with the guy.

1499
01:24:23,014 --> 01:24:25,184
Yeah, how do I know?

1500
01:24:25,224 --> 01:24:27,774
You can't make me stop
caring about people.

1501
01:24:27,814 --> 01:24:29,854
What? What?

1502
01:24:29,944 --> 01:24:33,863
I said,
you can't make me...

1503
01:24:33,903 --> 01:24:37,283
stop caring about people.

1504
01:24:42,823 --> 01:24:46,622
Listen... Ginger...

1505
01:24:46,702 --> 01:24:49,922
I'm trying to make the best
of everything here, you know?

1506
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:52,542
I mean, you're my wife,
for Christ's sakes.

1507
01:24:52,632 --> 01:24:55,671
I mean, people look up
to you in this town.

1508
01:24:55,711 --> 01:24:58,921
You know what, Ace?
I don't give a shit!

1509
01:24:58,971 --> 01:25:02,971
I'm gettin' out of here.
I am.

1510
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:10,440
Come over here.
You gotta get hold of yourself.

1511
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,440
- Okay. Okay.
- If not for me, at least for Amy.

1512
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,690
Understand? Your drinking's
gettin' way out of hand.

1513
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:20,149
I'm gonna get you into a program.
They got plenty of good ones.

1514
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:23,159
- I don't need one.
- Yes, you do. It's very discreet.

1515
01:25:23,239 --> 01:25:25,909
There's no names
in the papers.

1516
01:25:25,949 --> 01:25:30,288
That's all you care about.
You don't care about me.

1517
01:25:30,328 --> 01:25:32,418
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

1518
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:34,538
How could you say that?

1519
01:25:34,578 --> 01:25:37,548
You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.

1520
01:25:37,588 --> 01:25:40,547
You don't need that fuckin'
leech living off you.

1521
01:25:40,587 --> 01:25:43,587
I know you better
than you know yourself.

1522
01:25:43,677 --> 01:25:46,097
You're a tiger.
You're stronger than I am.

1523
01:25:46,177 --> 01:25:50,477
When you set your mind on doing
something, you do it better than anybody.

1524
01:25:54,146 --> 01:25:56,896
You're gonna do it.
Okay? You'll do it.

1525
01:25:56,976 --> 01:25:59,476
Oh, God.

1526
01:25:59,606 --> 01:26:02,446
Oh, God.

1527
01:26:02,526 --> 01:26:05,945
Okay.

1528
01:26:07,985 --> 01:26:10,535
I'll try. I'll try.

1529
01:26:10,575 --> 01:26:15,324
I'll try. I will.

1530
01:26:15,414 --> 01:26:18,334
Don't be mad at me, okay?

1531
01:26:18,374 --> 01:26:20,294
I will.

1532
01:26:29,303 --> 01:26:33,053
No matter what the problems
were outside the count room...

1533
01:26:33,133 --> 01:26:35,393
it was all worth it.

1534
01:26:35,473 --> 01:26:38,852
The cash kept rollin' in...

1535
01:26:38,892 --> 01:26:41,682
and the suitcases
kept comin' and goin'.

1536
01:26:41,732 --> 01:26:46,272
And let me tell you, the fuckin'
bottom line here is... cash.

1537
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:50,151
The only problem was
that after a while...

1538
01:26:50,281 --> 01:26:54,821
the bosses noticed that the suitcases
were gettin' a little light.

1539
01:26:54,861 --> 01:26:57,531
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me...

1540
01:26:57,621 --> 01:27:00,490
that the money we're robbing
is being robbed?

1541
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:02,500
Somebody's robbing from us?

1542
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:05,170
We go through all this trouble
and somebody's robbing us?

1543
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:06,750
Huh?

1544
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,460
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.

1545
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,879
Leakage my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.

1546
01:27:12,919 --> 01:27:15,719
Even John Nash...
that's the guy who ran the scam...

1547
01:27:15,799 --> 01:27:18,179
he knew there wasn't much
he could do about it.

1548
01:27:18,259 --> 01:27:20,599
You gotta know that
a guy who helps you steal...

1549
01:27:20,679 --> 01:27:22,888
even if you take care
of him real well...

1550
01:27:22,928 --> 01:27:25,098
he's gonna steal
a little extra for himself.

1551
01:27:25,188 --> 01:27:27,098
Makes sense, don't it?

1552
01:27:27,188 --> 01:27:30,728
Try and make these hardheaded
old greaseballs understand that.

1553
01:27:30,768 --> 01:27:35,237
What's the point of skimming if we're
being skimmed? It defeats the purpose.

1554
01:27:35,277 --> 01:27:36,817
Huh?

1555
01:27:36,857 --> 01:27:40,697
They take this money because they're
my guys, so give 'em some leeway.

1556
01:27:40,777 --> 01:27:43,117
But the bosses
never believed in leeway...

1557
01:27:43,247 --> 01:27:45,246
so listen to what they do.

1558
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:48,246
They put Artie Piscano,
the underboss of K. C...

1559
01:27:48,326 --> 01:27:51,706
in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim.

1560
01:27:51,876 --> 01:27:54,336
- What were you doin'?
- I was with my cumma.

1561
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:56,875
- What are you doin' with your cumma?
- I gave her a scheff.

1562
01:27:56,965 --> 01:27:59,335
The only trouble was,
Piscano was a disaster.

1563
01:27:59,425 --> 01:28:02,715
This guy could fuck up
a cup of coffee.

1564
01:28:02,805 --> 01:28:05,555
- What you been doin'?
- I'm out there more than I'm here.

1565
01:28:05,635 --> 01:28:08,014
And little did anybody know
where this would lead.

1566
01:28:08,094 --> 01:28:11,644
If they did, they'd would've
been better off makin' fuckin' novena.

1567
01:28:11,764 --> 01:28:13,934
You gotta go back there
and talk to that guy.

1568
01:28:14,064 --> 01:28:16,644
- I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
- What expenses?

1569
01:28:16,734 --> 01:28:21,063
I'm layin' money outta my own pocket,
and I never get anything back.

1570
01:28:21,153 --> 01:28:23,113
You gotta go back out there.

1571
01:28:23,233 --> 01:28:25,693
From now on, I'm gonna
start keepin' records.

1572
01:28:25,783 --> 01:28:29,413
No records, Artie. What are
you gonna do with records, pay taxes?

1573
01:28:29,453 --> 01:28:31,912
I keep layin' out
my own fuckin' dough.

1574
01:28:31,992 --> 01:28:34,412
What the hell are
we doin' over here?

1575
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:37,462
You're goin' to Las Vegas
at my expense.

1576
01:28:37,502 --> 01:28:39,422
Oh, fuck.
I mean, after all...

1577
01:28:39,502 --> 01:28:41,961
No matter how many novenas
you could make...

1578
01:28:42,091 --> 01:28:44,211
nothing was gonna stop
what came up next.

1579
01:28:44,301 --> 01:28:47,011
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- We made a deal.

1580
01:28:47,091 --> 01:28:49,891
It turned out Phil Green,
Mr. Integrity...

1581
01:28:49,971 --> 01:28:51,971
had a partner
nobody knew about.

1582
01:28:52,101 --> 01:28:55,310
And when she showed up
and started demanding money...

1583
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:58,690
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you're wrong.

1584
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:00,770
- Yes, you are.
- No, I am not wrong.

1585
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:03,060
Green tried to stonewall her.

1586
01:29:03,150 --> 01:29:05,939
I will see to it that you
do not get away with this.

1587
01:29:06,029 --> 01:29:08,069
So, she sued him in court.

1588
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:11,489
The court will now hear the matter
of the plaintiff, Anna Scott...

1589
01:29:11,529 --> 01:29:14,529
against Tangiers Corporation
and its president, Phil Green.

1590
01:29:14,619 --> 01:29:18,158
- Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
- Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.

1591
01:29:18,208 --> 01:29:20,498
- Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
- Thank you, Judge.

1592
01:29:20,668 --> 01:29:23,668
I believe he was fair,
and I'm delighted with the decision.

1593
01:29:23,748 --> 01:29:25,708
We got a problem.

1594
01:29:29,127 --> 01:29:32,007
It didn't go too well.
Green has to open up the books...

1595
01:29:32,047 --> 01:29:34,427
has to show how
he got the financing.

1596
01:29:34,507 --> 01:29:36,387
Hey, that's not good.

1597
01:29:39,346 --> 01:29:42,436
She was doin' pretty good
with her lawsuit.

1598
01:29:42,516 --> 01:29:44,856
But before she could start
countin' her money...

1599
01:29:44,896 --> 01:29:47,686
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court.

1600
01:29:47,726 --> 01:29:49,816
So they sent me.

1601
01:30:04,954 --> 01:30:07,874
Can you comment on
the murder of Anna Scott?

1602
01:30:07,954 --> 01:30:11,544
- What are you talking about?
- She was found last night shot in the head.

1603
01:30:11,624 --> 01:30:13,753
Was this just
a real estate partnership?

1604
01:30:13,793 --> 01:30:15,923
Her lawyer said
you were partners.

1605
01:30:15,963 --> 01:30:19,713
We were involved in minor
real estate deals many years ago.

1606
01:30:19,843 --> 01:30:22,383
It was never a partnership.

1607
01:30:22,513 --> 01:30:25,432
Did you ever hear
of the. 22 Caliber Killer?

1608
01:30:25,472 --> 01:30:28,432
Now, instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky...

1609
01:30:28,472 --> 01:30:30,772
they started looking
at Green too.

1610
01:30:30,812 --> 01:30:33,602
And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

1611
01:30:33,652 --> 01:30:36,571
I had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew...

1612
01:30:36,611 --> 01:30:38,901
the casino
was on the up-and-up.

1613
01:30:38,981 --> 01:30:41,531
So how often do you
really fill in for him?

1614
01:30:43,611 --> 01:30:46,451
Green's here about
two or three times a month...

1615
01:30:46,486 --> 01:30:49,040
and he's busy
with real estate deals.

1616
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:52,120
So in Green's absence,
then, you're the boss?

1617
01:30:52,210 --> 01:30:55,250
I serve at the pleasure
of the chairman of the board.

1618
01:30:55,380 --> 01:31:00,799
My responsibilities are
to run the day-to-day operations.

1619
01:31:00,839 --> 01:31:03,049
So day-to-day, then,
you're the boss?

1620
01:31:03,089 --> 01:31:06,799
Well, in a sense, you could say
that I am the boss...

1621
01:31:06,849 --> 01:31:09,638
when Mr. Green is away.

1622
01:31:11,348 --> 01:31:13,388
You could say that.

1623
01:31:13,978 --> 01:31:15,478
Hmm, have you read this?

1624
01:31:17,438 --> 01:31:19,478
About Mr. Rothstein.

1625
01:31:19,518 --> 01:31:22,357
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker
with mob ties...

1626
01:31:22,437 --> 01:31:24,907
says that he is the real boss
of the $100 million...

1627
01:31:24,987 --> 01:31:27,657
Tangiers casino empire. "

1628
01:31:27,697 --> 01:31:29,867
Did he really say that?

1629
01:31:29,947 --> 01:31:33,156
Why, of course he said that.
It's right here.

1630
01:31:33,206 --> 01:31:37,206
Has that man even filed
for his license yet?

1631
01:31:37,286 --> 01:31:39,956
I don't know.
We have to check the files.

1632
01:31:39,996 --> 01:31:42,506
Without gettin' your shorts
in a knot, would you do that?

1633
01:31:42,546 --> 01:31:46,635
And kinda check closely, 'cause we may
have to kick a kike's ass outta town.

1634
01:31:46,675 --> 01:31:48,635
Thank you.

1635
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:52,885
A Gaming Control Board
investigation...

1636
01:31:53,015 --> 01:31:55,224
of Tangiers executive
Sam Rothstein's application...

1637
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,764
for a gaming license
is underway.

1638
01:31:57,894 --> 01:32:01,604
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers Casino
operation and is a boyhood friend...

1639
01:32:01,644 --> 01:32:04,104
of Las Vegas mob boss
Nicky Santoro...

1640
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:06,394
could lose his ability
to work in the casino...

1641
01:32:08,483 --> 01:32:11,943
Hello?

1642
01:32:11,983 --> 01:32:17,113
- I gotta meet Clean Face. What about the Chez Paris?
- You can't.

1643
01:32:17,163 --> 01:32:19,322
- You gotta make a reservation. It's all booked up.
- No, no.

1644
01:32:19,412 --> 01:32:22,332
It's impossible.
You gotta make a reservation.

1645
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:24,332
It's very difficult
to get in.

1646
01:32:24,412 --> 01:32:27,332
I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at 9:00.

1647
01:32:27,422 --> 01:32:30,341
All right.

1648
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:34,341
The battle between State gaming
officials and Tangiers Casino boss...

1649
01:32:34,381 --> 01:32:36,841
Sam "Ace" Rothstein
is heating up.

1650
01:32:36,931 --> 01:32:41,100
Tonight, an up-to-the-minute look at Ace
Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing...

1651
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:45,350
despite law enforcement allegations of
Rothstein's organized crime connections.

1652
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:49,940
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with alleged
organized crime figure Nicky Santoro...

1653
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:52,689
keep Rothstein from running
the Tangiers Casino?

1654
01:32:52,769 --> 01:32:56,779
And can the integrity of state gaming laws
be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?

1655
01:32:56,859 --> 01:33:00,369
- Why don't you take it easy
on that stuff? Huh?

1656
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:03,159
Come on.
Let me help you down.

1657
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,158
We're talking
about some stuff.

1658
01:33:05,198 --> 01:33:09,248
At 6:00: Will a boyhood friendship unseat
Rothstein as the Tangiers Casino boss?

1659
01:33:09,288 --> 01:33:13,128
Exclusive on the KBBO
special news report.

1660
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:17,217
Go down. Just... go downst-

1661
01:33:21,007 --> 01:33:25,177
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry.

1662
01:33:25,217 --> 01:33:27,726
It's just a political
witch hunt.

1663
01:33:31,896 --> 01:33:34,476
Ace.

1664
01:33:34,606 --> 01:33:36,986
Do you want
something to drink?

1665
01:33:37,066 --> 01:33:39,065
- Charlie, a refill?
- Yeah, great.

1666
01:33:39,105 --> 01:33:42,530
No. Hey, Mr. Clark.
I've been tryin' to reach you.

1667
01:33:42,565 --> 01:33:45,575
- You're tougher to get than the president.
- Well, I've been busy.

1668
01:33:45,655 --> 01:33:48,655
Yeah? At least you could return
my phone calls, though.

1669
01:33:48,745 --> 01:33:52,034
Listen, Nicky,
we talked about this.

1670
01:33:52,124 --> 01:33:56,544
And I explained to you that you might
have to take some kind of loss.

1671
01:33:56,584 --> 01:33:58,834
Yeah.

1672
01:33:58,914 --> 01:34:01,833
I think I want my money back.

1673
01:34:01,963 --> 01:34:06,253
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?

1674
01:34:06,303 --> 01:34:10,513
- You know, I think you've gotten
the wrong impression about me.

1675
01:34:10,593 --> 01:34:13,142
I think, in all fairness...

1676
01:34:13,222 --> 01:34:17,102
I should explain to you
exactly what it is that I do.

1677
01:34:17,182 --> 01:34:21,482
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice
and early, take a walk to the bank...

1678
01:34:21,522 --> 01:34:25,521
and walk in and see, and, uh,
if you don't have my money for me...

1679
01:34:25,611 --> 01:34:28,941
I'll crack your fuckin' head
wide open in front of everybody.

1680
01:34:29,031 --> 01:34:32,611
And just about the time
that I'm comin' out of jail...

1681
01:34:32,701 --> 01:34:36,790
hopefully you'll be comin'
out of your coma.

1682
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:40,460
And guess what? I'll split
your fuckin' head open again.

1683
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:44,710
'Cause I'm fuckin' stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.

1684
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:47,709
That's my business.
That's what I do.

1685
01:34:47,839 --> 01:34:52,339
We know what you do. You fuck people
out of money and get away with it.

1686
01:34:52,429 --> 01:34:55,849
- You can't talk to me like that.
- Hey, you fat Irish prick! You put my money to sleep!

1687
01:34:55,929 --> 01:34:58,768
- Get my money, or I'll put your brain to sleep.
- Sam!

1688
01:34:58,848 --> 01:35:00,928
Never mind Sam.
This is personal.

1689
01:35:00,978 --> 01:35:04,978
I'll be there in the morning. You can
try me, Fatso. You fuckin' try me.

1690
01:35:05,018 --> 01:35:07,978
You think he got the point?

1691
01:35:08,018 --> 01:35:13,407
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for
chrissakes. He's gonna run to the F.B.I.

1692
01:35:13,487 --> 01:35:18,537
That prick's been dodgin' me for three
weeks. You're tryin' to tell me what to do.

1693
01:35:18,617 --> 01:35:22,496
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do.
You're outta line. Where's your head?

1694
01:35:22,576 --> 01:35:26,706
Where's my head?
Where's your fuckin' balls?

1695
01:35:26,786 --> 01:35:30,456
I'm tryin' to put somethin' big together
here. You know what I'm talkin' about.

1696
01:35:30,506 --> 01:35:33,335
If you're actin' like this now,
can I depend on you?

1697
01:35:33,425 --> 01:35:38,505
A lot of things gonna change. If you wanna be
there with me, you're gonna have to go my way.

1698
01:35:38,635 --> 01:35:42,055
Listen, Nick, understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.

1699
01:35:42,135 --> 01:35:45,184
I got a hundred million a year
goin' through the place.

1700
01:35:45,224 --> 01:35:48,014
It's all over if I don't
get that license.

1701
01:35:48,104 --> 01:35:51,024
If it goes bad for me,
it's bad for a lot of people.

1702
01:35:51,064 --> 01:35:56,773
Forget about your fuckin' license. I plant
my own flag, you ain't gonna need a license.

1703
01:35:56,863 --> 01:36:01,323
You know, I don't know what it is,
Sammy, but the more I talk to you...

1704
01:36:01,403 --> 01:36:03,653
the more I feel like you just
don't want to go along with me.

1705
01:36:03,703 --> 01:36:07,662
- No, I don't want to come along with you.
- All right, fine.

1706
01:36:07,702 --> 01:36:10,492
I don't want to be involved
in anything you're talking about, okay?

1707
01:36:10,542 --> 01:36:13,292
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.

1708
01:36:13,372 --> 01:36:15,292
I want everything quiet.
That's it!

1709
01:36:15,372 --> 01:36:17,751
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"? That's quiet?

1710
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:19,801
That's taken out of context.
I had no control over that.

1711
01:36:19,881 --> 01:36:24,591
- Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.
- Back home that looks bad.

1712
01:36:24,631 --> 01:36:28,760
Looks bad? Every time you're on
television, I get mentioned. That looks bad.

1713
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:31,600
- What the fuck happened to you?
- What happened to me?

1714
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,600
- What happened to you? You lost control.
- I lost control?

1715
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:36,650
Look at you, you're fuckin' walkin'
around like John Barrymore.

1716
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:41,729
A pink robe and a fuckin'
cigarette holder? I lost control?

1717
01:36:41,819 --> 01:36:46,569
I don't wanna bring this up, but you been
treatin' people with disrespect, even your wife.

1718
01:36:46,609 --> 01:36:49,569
My wife? What does she have
to do with this?

1719
01:36:49,619 --> 01:36:55,118
She was upset about a lot of things, especially
that whole fuckin' Lester Diamond incident.

1720
01:36:55,208 --> 01:36:59,038
You're the shoulder to cry on? Did you her
tell about your little role in that situation?

1721
01:36:59,128 --> 01:37:01,418
No, that's not
the fuckin' point.

1722
01:37:01,498 --> 01:37:05,217
- The point is, she's upset, and you've got a problem.
- I would appreciate it...

1723
01:37:05,257 --> 01:37:07,217
if you stay out
of my personal life.

1724
01:37:07,257 --> 01:37:11,097
- You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
- She came to talk to me.

1725
01:37:11,177 --> 01:37:13,467
What was I supposed to do?
Throw her out?

1726
01:37:13,517 --> 01:37:16,726
- Stay away from her. It's none of your business.
- It's none of my business?

1727
01:37:16,806 --> 01:37:21,936
A week ago it was. Now it's none of my
business. When you need me, you need me.

1728
01:37:22,016 --> 01:37:24,776
The way you need me
to vouch for you as a citizen.

1729
01:37:24,856 --> 01:37:27,605
I'm gonna have to straighten out
what you did with this guy.

1730
01:37:27,695 --> 01:37:30,615
This guy is gonna run
to the F.B.I. Now.

1731
01:37:30,695 --> 01:37:32,615
Your head's bigger
than your casino.

1732
01:37:32,695 --> 01:37:36,614
I knew what
he wanted. Nicky wanted to take over.

1733
01:37:36,744 --> 01:37:41,624
He wanted to go after Gaggi,
the skim, everything and everybody.

1734
01:37:41,664 --> 01:37:45,454
Plus, he had stopped asking permission
from back home for every little thing.

1735
01:37:49,333 --> 01:37:55,013
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.

1736
01:37:55,053 --> 01:37:57,973
A dealer from the Sirocco.
They questioned Nicky.

1737
01:37:58,053 --> 01:38:02,262
A bunch of stool pigeons wound up in the
trunks of their cars. They questioned Nicky.

1738
01:38:02,352 --> 01:38:04,262
A lawyer.

1739
01:38:04,352 --> 01:38:08,022
They questioned Nicky.

1740
01:38:08,102 --> 01:38:11,271
When some guys that didn't pay
their shylocks began disappearing...

1741
01:38:11,351 --> 01:38:14,271
Nicky's name was in every one
of those newspapers.

1742
01:38:14,361 --> 01:38:18,201
Nicky was questioned in two dozen
murders, but they always had to let him go.

1743
01:38:18,281 --> 01:38:20,201
There were never any witnesses.

1744
01:38:20,281 --> 01:38:23,330
The coppers blamed me
for everything that went wrong.

1745
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:26,120
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over, there.

1746
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:30,120
If a guy fuckin' tripped over a
banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.

1747
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:32,130
Come on, be nice, huh?

1748
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:36,299
And the bosses were no better. They
complained because things don't run smooth.

1749
01:38:36,379 --> 01:38:39,799
In my line of work,
things don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.

1750
01:38:39,879 --> 01:38:41,969
I'm dealin' with degenerate
animals out here.

1751
01:38:42,009 --> 01:38:43,969
But the bosses,
what do they give a fuck?

1752
01:38:44,009 --> 01:38:46,468
They're sittin' on their asses
drinkin' anisette.

1753
01:38:46,558 --> 01:38:49,138
I'm the guy in the trenches.

1754
01:38:49,228 --> 01:38:52,728
Fuckin' bosses think it's
a fuckin' free lunch out here.

1755
01:38:52,768 --> 01:38:56,897
Frankie, they found
a guy's head in the desert.

1756
01:38:56,977 --> 01:38:58,897
You know about that?

1757
01:38:58,987 --> 01:39:01,567
- Yeah, I heard. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1758
01:39:01,607 --> 01:39:05,527
Everybody's talkin'. They're makin' a big
deal out of it. It's in all the papers.

1759
01:39:05,617 --> 01:39:08,246
What are you gonna do?

1760
01:39:08,286 --> 01:39:14,126
And I mean, that's no good. You gotta tell
him to take care of things a little better.

1761
01:39:14,206 --> 01:39:16,546
I'll tell him, Remo.

1762
01:39:16,586 --> 01:39:18,955
Fuckin' bosses;
they're smokin' their Di Nobilis...

1763
01:39:19,045 --> 01:39:22,295
and they're eatin' trippa and fuckin'
suffritte, you know, fried pigs' guts.

1764
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:25,795
If I want to talk private,
I gotta go to a bus stop.

1765
01:39:25,885 --> 01:39:30,264
- What do they care long as I keep sendin' money back?
- They're complainin'.

1766
01:39:30,344 --> 01:39:34,184
Let 'em complain. I'm the one
who's here. I do all the work.

1767
01:39:34,264 --> 01:39:38,724
- Somebody don't like it, fuck 'em.
- It's up to you.

1768
01:39:38,854 --> 01:39:41,773
They want a fuckin' war?
I'm ready.

1769
01:39:41,853 --> 01:39:45,773
All I gotta do is take care of five of
those guys. The rest will fall into place.

1770
01:39:45,863 --> 01:39:48,983
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.

1771
01:39:49,073 --> 01:39:51,953
I see you,
you motherfuckers.

1772
01:39:51,993 --> 01:39:55,912
Nicky was not only bringing
heat on himself but on me too.

1773
01:39:55,952 --> 01:40:00,332
The F.B.I. Watched every move he made,
but he didn't care. He just didn't care.

1774
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:03,422
If they're gonna watch me,
I'm gonna watch 'em right back.

1775
01:40:03,462 --> 01:40:06,541
I spent a few bucks.
Top dollar. Who gives a shit?

1776
01:40:06,631 --> 01:40:11,051
I got the latest anti-buggin' equipment from
the same places that sell to the fuckin' C.I.A.

1777
01:40:11,131 --> 01:40:16,930
I had special police frequency radios, F.B.I.
De-scramblers, cameras that see in the dark.

1778
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:22,350
And because of that, the miserable sons
of bitches never caught me doin' anything.

1779
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:26,690
I got my job on the line, and
this guy's havin' the time of his life.

1780
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:30,649
He has every cop in the state
watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.

1781
01:40:30,689 --> 01:40:33,739
And at the worst
possible time for me.

1782
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:37,409
I had my license hearing coming up, and
I didn't want to leave anything to chance.

1783
01:40:37,449 --> 01:40:41,333
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas,
where am I gonna go?

1784
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:44,328
You've been very open with us.
I mean, your books and papers.

1785
01:40:44,408 --> 01:40:47,328
That's gonna mean something
when you go before the commission.

1786
01:40:47,418 --> 01:40:51,757
- All I ask is a fair hearing.
- This kind of honesty will guarantee that fair hearing.

1787
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:55,467
All right, well, we'll move on to...

1788
01:40:55,507 --> 01:41:00,177
- I wanted to hear
something about Kansas City.

1789
01:41:00,217 --> 01:41:02,596
What the fuck is this?

1790
01:41:05,016 --> 01:41:09,226
Where's this guy
gonna land, the fairway?

1791
01:41:27,704 --> 01:41:30,244
They're fuckin' agents, Frankie.
Look at this.

1792
01:41:31,834 --> 01:41:35,163
The Feds were watching Nicky
play golf for so long...

1793
01:41:35,213 --> 01:41:37,463
they ran out of gas.

1794
01:41:37,543 --> 01:41:41,213
Just what I needed, right
in front of the Control Board.

1795
01:41:45,923 --> 01:41:49,892
A hundred dollars,
whoever hits the plane.

1796
01:41:49,972 --> 01:41:55,602
And as if things weren't bad enough, in
comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.

1797
01:41:55,682 --> 01:41:58,561
He ran that little grocery store in Kansas
City where they bought the suitcases.

1798
01:41:58,601 --> 01:42:02,536
Fightin' over those suitcases again.
You know what that means, right?

1799
01:42:02,571 --> 01:42:05,901
I gotta take another trip to Vegas, and
it's gonna cost me another couple grand.

1800
01:42:05,991 --> 01:42:08,361
He ran it with his brother-in-law...

1801
01:42:08,451 --> 01:42:11,370
but mostly what he did was complain
about his trips to Vegas.

1802
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:15,830
You gotta lay down the law, otherwise
they're gonna make a fool out of you.

1803
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:19,420
I write it all down. Every fuckin'
nickel goes down. Receipts...

1804
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:23,169
- Hey, oh, wha... What's the matter with you?
- Everything's here.

1805
01:42:23,249 --> 01:42:25,799
- Since when do you talk like that?
- I'm sorry.

1806
01:42:25,879 --> 01:42:29,719
Nance gives me trouble, I'll tell him I'll
take the eyes out of his frickin' head.

1807
01:42:29,799 --> 01:42:32,048
- Again.
- I said, "frickin' head. "

1808
01:42:32,098 --> 01:42:34,178
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.

1809
01:42:34,258 --> 01:42:36,178
What happens next?
You can't believe it.

1810
01:42:36,268 --> 01:42:38,558
Who would believe that the F.B.I.
Had a wire in the place...

1811
01:42:38,638 --> 01:42:41,148
lookin' for some information
about some old homicide...

1812
01:42:41,228 --> 01:42:45,147
about some guy who was whacked-out
God knows when over God knows what.

1813
01:42:45,227 --> 01:42:48,147
What's to prevent him with the suitcases
that he could take what he wants?

1814
01:42:48,277 --> 01:42:51,947
Fuckin' Nance takes back two suitcases
from the Tangiers. What about three or four?

1815
01:42:52,027 --> 01:42:55,116
We've got nobody
in the room to watch. That's the law.

1816
01:42:55,196 --> 01:42:58,706
We can't even go into the count room to
watch our money. You believe this bullshit?

1817
01:42:58,826 --> 01:43:04,626
Sure, he's got his people in there. They
could all be in on it together, those fucks.

1818
01:43:04,746 --> 01:43:07,505
I'll find out. If it's Green,
I'll bury that bastard.

1819
01:43:07,625 --> 01:43:11,885
I never trusted him.
They trust that scumbag. I don't.

1820
01:43:11,965 --> 01:43:15,425
- I'll hit the two of them with a fuckin' shovel.
- Take it easy.

1821
01:43:15,505 --> 01:43:17,674
Ma, I'm sorry.
They're beatin' me left and right.

1822
01:43:17,804 --> 01:43:20,844
- Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
- I know, but that's enough.

1823
01:43:20,934 --> 01:43:23,974
You know what they're doin'. I can't
take this no more. Back and forth.

1824
01:43:24,104 --> 01:43:27,774
- Take it easy. You'll get a heart attack like that.
- I know. I'm too upset.

1825
01:43:27,854 --> 01:43:31,143
And the damn thing is,
they hear all this stuff...

1826
01:43:31,313 --> 01:43:34,563
about Las Vegas
and the casinos and suitcases...

1827
01:43:34,653 --> 01:43:36,653
and that's it.

1828
01:43:42,362 --> 01:43:45,702
Everything's comin' outta my pocket.
I gotta pay.

1829
01:43:45,872 --> 01:43:47,992
Would you believe that
such a thing could happen?

1830
01:43:48,082 --> 01:43:51,002
I'm in this to make money,
not to lose money.

1831
01:43:51,082 --> 01:43:54,881
Every F.B.I. Man across the country
had their ears open now.

1832
01:43:55,001 --> 01:43:58,001
If you want something done right
you gotta do it yourself.

1833
01:43:58,051 --> 01:44:03,510
I mean, Piscano, this guy
basically sunk the whole world.

1834
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:06,430
There are some that are good
and some that are bad.

1835
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,020
Mr. Chairman,
members of the commission...

1836
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:11,690
Mr. Rothstein is pleased
to be here today.

1837
01:44:11,730 --> 01:44:14,439
When the day finally came, I was ready.

1838
01:44:14,519 --> 01:44:18,149
I felt so confident that
all I had to do was present my case.

1839
01:44:18,279 --> 01:44:23,819
We have documents, one of which is
a report by retired F.B.I. Agents...

1840
01:44:23,949 --> 01:44:26,578
which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein
from any wrongdoing.

1841
01:44:26,698 --> 01:44:30,078
- Counselor, before you continue...
- I want to have this marked...

1842
01:44:30,118 --> 01:44:34,248
This commission is prepared to act on a
motion denying the Rothstein application.

1843
01:44:34,288 --> 01:44:36,838
- Denying?
- Do I hear a motion seconded?

1844
01:44:36,958 --> 01:44:38,997
Mr. Chairman,
I second the motion.

1845
01:44:39,087 --> 01:44:41,047
Do I have a vote
on the motion?

1846
01:44:41,087 --> 01:44:43,377
- Aye.
- Aye. Aye.

1847
01:44:43,547 --> 01:44:45,387
The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.

1848
01:44:45,547 --> 01:44:49,256
- You have to be kidding.
- Adjourned? What do you mean, "Adjourned"?

1849
01:44:49,386 --> 01:44:53,806
Senator, you promised me a hearing. You
didn't even look at the F.B.I. Reports.

1850
01:44:53,936 --> 01:44:59,776
When you were my guest at the Tangiers
Hotel, did you not promise me a fair hearing?

1851
01:44:59,855 --> 01:45:03,735
- I was never your guest.
- You were never my guest? I never comped you?

1852
01:45:03,855 --> 01:45:07,615
- I don't comp you at least three times a month?
- I'd like to answer that.

1853
01:45:07,735 --> 01:45:11,194
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical
to this point. He's lying.

1854
01:45:11,284 --> 01:45:15,454
The only time I was at the Tangiers
was with Barney Greenstein.

1855
01:45:15,574 --> 01:45:18,494
- Was I at that dinner? Tell me, was I at that dinner?
- You were wandering.

1856
01:45:18,584 --> 01:45:21,244
- Was I at that dinner? Was I?
- You were wandering.

1857
01:45:21,294 --> 01:45:24,293
- You were... in the... You were in the building.
- I was in the building?

1858
01:45:24,413 --> 01:45:30,173
You know I was at that dinner, and you swore
to me I would have a fair hearing. Did you not?

1859
01:45:30,343 --> 01:45:35,972
Did you not? Well, tell me I was at
least at the dinner. Allow me that much.

1860
01:45:36,052 --> 01:45:39,892
- Give me that much at least!
- Yes, you were.

1861
01:45:39,972 --> 01:45:44,392
Thanks for not calling me a liar,
you son of a bitch. You son of a...

1862
01:45:44,482 --> 01:45:47,771
A routine licensing hearing
turned into bedlam yesterday...

1863
01:45:47,941 --> 01:45:50,731
when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino
executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...

1864
01:45:50,821 --> 01:45:54,491
- What are you runnin' for, Bob?
- Accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.

1865
01:45:54,611 --> 01:45:57,360
You promised me when you were
getting comped at my hotel.

1866
01:45:57,410 --> 01:46:01,030
You were asking me for copies of your bill
so you could put 'em on your expense account.

1867
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:04,200
In a wild outburst that followed
his gaming license denial...

1868
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:06,580
- Bullshit! Bullshit!
- Rothstein followed several...

1869
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:10,339
stunned commissioners into the hallway
where he continued his harangue...

1870
01:46:10,459 --> 01:46:12,839
until his own lawyers
and friends urged him to leave.

1871
01:46:12,959 --> 01:46:17,379
You have a past. I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.

1872
01:46:17,429 --> 01:46:19,888
But you guys think you have
the right to pass judgment!

1873
01:46:19,928 --> 01:46:23,138
Long suspected of running
the Tangiers without a license...

1874
01:46:23,218 --> 01:46:27,058
yesterday's hearing was to determine
whether someone with Rothstein's history...

1875
01:46:27,188 --> 01:46:30,807
was qualified to officially hold
a top gaming post.

1876
01:46:30,937 --> 01:46:33,687
Fuckin' hypocrites!

1877
01:46:33,727 --> 01:46:37,147
- What the hell's he gonna do now?
- I don't know.

1878
01:46:37,237 --> 01:46:41,157
What's he doin'? He knows all those
guys he yelled at are friends of ours.

1879
01:46:41,237 --> 01:46:43,946
What's the matter with him,
making all this mess?

1880
01:46:44,036 --> 01:46:49,166
Maybe he could run things with another
job title. What are we gonna do?

1881
01:46:49,246 --> 01:46:53,496
However he runs things, it's gotta be
quiet. Let him hide upstairs in the office.

1882
01:46:53,585 --> 01:46:56,665
Say he's a janitor.
I don't give a shit.

1883
01:46:56,755 --> 01:47:01,795
But, please, whatever job he takes,
make sure it's something quiet.

1884
01:47:09,474 --> 01:47:11,434
Ladies and gentlemen...

1885
01:47:11,474 --> 01:47:14,184
the Tangiers Hotel
proudly presents the all-new...

1886
01:47:14,264 --> 01:47:18,353
Sam Rothstein show,
Aces High.

1887
01:47:20,903 --> 01:47:23,773
Tonight, taped live
from the all-new Sports Book...

1888
01:47:23,823 --> 01:47:27,403
we present the premiere showing
of Aces High...

1889
01:47:27,533 --> 01:47:31,242
with the Sasha Semenoff
Orchestra...

1890
01:47:31,282 --> 01:47:33,242
and the Sam Rothstein Dancers!

1891
01:47:35,992 --> 01:47:40,081
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and
the best football handicapper in America;

1892
01:47:40,121 --> 01:47:45,381
a man who will take you inside the real
Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.

1893
01:47:45,461 --> 01:47:49,841
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the new entertainment
director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...

1894
01:47:49,931 --> 01:47:53,220
Mr. Sam Rothstein.

1895
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:05,319
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show. We're
very happy to have you here this evening.

1896
01:48:05,399 --> 01:48:08,439
The young lady to my left
is Trudy, who is...

1897
01:48:08,489 --> 01:48:11,449
a lead new dancer
in our fabulous show from Paris.

1898
01:48:11,489 --> 01:48:14,068
Our first guest this evening...

1899
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:16,828
is Frankie Avalon.

1900
01:48:22,168 --> 01:48:26,167
- Keep an eye on him.
- I've got a large family.

1901
01:48:26,207 --> 01:48:30,917
- How many kids do you have?
- I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.

1902
01:48:31,007 --> 01:48:33,967
No, no, please. Please.

1903
01:48:34,007 --> 01:48:38,136
- That's amazing.
- There's nothing to it. It was my pleasure.

1904
01:48:38,176 --> 01:48:41,806
- Ace, don't do it.
- ##

1905
01:48:41,846 --> 01:48:44,726
Oh, no, no. Oh, no.

1906
01:48:44,806 --> 01:48:47,016
Oh, Jesus.

1907
01:48:47,066 --> 01:48:49,355
He's juggling!

1908
01:48:49,435 --> 01:48:53,195
Let's not take Commissioner
Pat Webb too seriously.

1909
01:48:53,275 --> 01:48:56,695
I recently challenged him to a debate
on this program, and he declined.

1910
01:48:56,775 --> 01:49:01,454
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.

1911
01:49:01,534 --> 01:49:04,284
You can ask me
anything you want.

1912
01:49:04,324 --> 01:49:07,244
What the hell is he doin'
on television, anyway?

1913
01:49:07,334 --> 01:49:12,543
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's
gonna take his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.

1914
01:49:12,623 --> 01:49:16,133
He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?

1915
01:49:16,213 --> 01:49:18,923
He's out
of his fuckin' mind.

1916
01:49:18,963 --> 01:49:22,172
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.

1917
01:49:22,222 --> 01:49:25,182
Other people have to pay
through the nose. Such is life.

1918
01:49:25,222 --> 01:49:31,022
Andy, go see him. Tell him
maybe it's time he should quit.

1919
01:49:35,981 --> 01:49:38,901
First of all, what they did
was totally unconstitutional.

1920
01:49:38,981 --> 01:49:42,741
We're on the list to be heard before
the Supreme Court of the United States.

1921
01:49:42,781 --> 01:49:48,330
These guys don't give a fuck about the
Supreme Court. They want you to walk away.

1922
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:52,910
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How
can I walk away? Don't you see what's at stake?

1923
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,329
The old man said maybe
your friend should give in.

1924
01:49:56,419 --> 01:49:59,249
When the old man says "maybe,"
that's like a papal bull.

1925
01:49:59,289 --> 01:50:02,169
Not only should you quit,
you should run.

1926
01:50:02,259 --> 01:50:06,179
Every time they mention my name
in the papers, they mention Nicky too.

1927
01:50:06,259 --> 01:50:08,718
How the fuck
does that help?

1928
01:50:08,798 --> 01:50:11,718
The heat he brought down
is murder.

1929
01:50:11,808 --> 01:50:17,558
The police department was cooperative. He
pissed 'em off. Nobody can make a move anymore.

1930
01:50:17,648 --> 01:50:21,017
- What are you proposing?
- I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.

1931
01:50:21,107 --> 01:50:23,937
Maybe he should get lost
for awhile. Would that be so bad?

1932
01:50:24,027 --> 01:50:26,527
- They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
- If he took a break...

1933
01:50:26,607 --> 01:50:28,817
it would give everybody
time to maneuver.

1934
01:50:28,907 --> 01:50:33,786
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.

1935
01:50:36,616 --> 01:50:39,456
I can't do that.

1936
01:50:39,496 --> 01:50:43,755
As soon as Andy got home,
Nicky heard about our talk.

1937
01:50:43,795 --> 01:50:46,715
Next morning, bright and early,
I get the call.

1938
01:50:46,835 --> 01:50:49,715
Great. You know, I've got to do
some shopping. You want to go?

1939
01:50:49,795 --> 01:50:51,965
Getting a call
from Nicky wasn't easy.

1940
01:50:52,055 --> 01:50:55,094
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.

1941
01:50:55,134 --> 01:51:00,684
If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only
listen in on the stuff involving crimes.

1942
01:51:00,724 --> 01:51:03,564
So on routine calls, they have
to click off after a few minutes.

1943
01:51:03,644 --> 01:51:06,483
Yeah, I got
a sprained fuckin' elbow.

1944
01:51:06,523 --> 01:51:08,313
- Yeah.
- Meet me at 3:00.

1945
01:51:08,353 --> 01:51:10,943
- At Caesar's?
- 100 yards down the road.

1946
01:51:10,983 --> 01:51:14,233
- Why?
- Don't ask questions. Just be there.

1947
01:51:15,822 --> 01:51:19,202
Suzy Cream Cheese has
the exact same outfit.

1948
01:51:19,242 --> 01:51:21,992
I saw something.

1949
01:51:22,032 --> 01:51:25,202
Something very cute.

1950
01:51:25,292 --> 01:51:29,331
Okay, he's out.
It's the ant. Brown unit.

1951
01:51:29,421 --> 01:51:31,881
And he's with the bogey.
I think it's Frankie.

1952
01:51:31,916 --> 01:51:34,341
Nicky started out before me...

1953
01:51:34,381 --> 01:51:37,341
because it wasn't that easy
for him to get around.

1954
01:51:37,421 --> 01:51:41,260
Nicky couldn't even go
for a ride without changing cars...

1955
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:44,560
at least six times
before he could shake all his tails.

1956
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:47,640
Because of the planes,
he had to use underground garages.

1957
01:52:18,757 --> 01:52:21,717
Meeting in the middle
of the desert always made me nervous.

1958
01:52:21,757 --> 01:52:24,046
It's a scary place.

1959
01:52:24,096 --> 01:52:26,716
I knew about the holes
in the desert, of course.

1960
01:52:26,766 --> 01:52:30,476
And everywhere I looked,
there could have been a hole.

1961
01:52:30,636 --> 01:52:34,186
Normally, my prospects
of comin' back alive...

1962
01:52:34,266 --> 01:52:37,185
from a meetin' with Nicky
were 99 out of 100.

1963
01:52:39,105 --> 01:52:44,065
But this time, when I heard him say a
couple of hundred yards down the road...

1964
01:52:44,115 --> 01:52:46,074
I gave myself 50-50.

1965
01:53:05,793 --> 01:53:10,722
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to
people behind my back, goin' over my head?

1966
01:53:10,802 --> 01:53:14,182
- What people?
- What people? What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?

1967
01:53:14,302 --> 01:53:16,222
I don't even know
what you're talkin' about.

1968
01:53:16,312 --> 01:53:21,181
You said I'm bringin' heat on you? I gotta
listen to people because of your shit?

1969
01:53:21,271 --> 01:53:24,561
You're orderin' me out? You better get
your own fuckin' army, pal!

1970
01:53:24,601 --> 01:53:29,071
I didn't order you or anybody. I told Andy
Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.

1971
01:53:29,151 --> 01:53:31,990
- You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?
- Yeah.

1972
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:34,820
Let the bullshit blow over
so I can run the casino.

1973
01:53:34,870 --> 01:53:38,450
Anything goes wrong with the casino,
it's my ass. It's not yours. It's my ass.

1974
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:43,209
I don't know whether you know you have your
fuckin' casino because I made that possible!

1975
01:53:43,289 --> 01:53:48,749
I'm what counts out here. Not your fuckin'
country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows!

1976
01:53:48,839 --> 01:53:51,669
And what the fuck
are you doin' on TV anyhow?

1977
01:53:51,759 --> 01:53:55,968
I get calls from home every day.
They think you went batshit!

1978
01:53:56,048 --> 01:53:59,888
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able
to hang around the casino. You understand.

1979
01:53:59,968 --> 01:54:03,098
You could have had the food-and-beverage
job without goin' on television!

1980
01:54:03,188 --> 01:54:05,188
You wanted to go on TV.

1981
01:54:05,228 --> 01:54:08,187
Yeah, I wanted to go on TV. That
way I have a forum. I can fight back.

1982
01:54:08,227 --> 01:54:11,987
They know they can't fuck around with me like
they could if I was an unknown. That's right.

1983
01:54:12,027 --> 01:54:14,147
You're makin'
a spectacle of yourself.

1984
01:54:14,197 --> 01:54:18,156
Me? I wouldn't even be
in this situation if it wasn't for you.

1985
01:54:18,196 --> 01:54:21,116
Every time I meet somebody,
the question is: Do I know you?

1986
01:54:21,196 --> 01:54:24,666
- Sure, now you wanna blame your fuckin' license on me.
- No, Nicky.

1987
01:54:24,706 --> 01:54:27,706
When you asked me
if you could come out here...

1988
01:54:27,786 --> 01:54:30,705
what did I tell you?
Do you remember?

1989
01:54:30,795 --> 01:54:33,835
- Back up a fuckin' minute here.
- Do you remember what I told you?

1990
01:54:33,875 --> 01:54:38,215
I asked you? When the fuck did
I ever ask you if I could come out here?

1991
01:54:38,295 --> 01:54:42,764
Get this through your head,
you Jew motherfucker, you!

1992
01:54:42,844 --> 01:54:46,844
You only exist out here because of me!
That's the only reason!

1993
01:54:46,894 --> 01:54:49,474
Without me,
you personally...

1994
01:54:49,554 --> 01:54:54,523
Every fuckin' wise guy still around will
take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass!

1995
01:54:54,563 --> 01:54:57,903
Then where you gonna go?
You're fuckin' warned.

1996
01:54:57,983 --> 01:55:00,983
Don't go over my head again,
you motherfucker, you!

1997
01:55:25,510 --> 01:55:29,260
# Crack that whip #

1998
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:31,970
- # Give the past the slip #
- Well, we got company.

1999
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:34,470
# Step on a crack #

2000
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,639
# Break your mama's back #

2001
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:42,229
# When a problem comes along
you must whip it #

2002
01:55:42,269 --> 01:55:44,229
# Before the preacher
talks too long #

2003
01:55:44,279 --> 01:55:46,699
- # You must whip it #
- Did you see that?

2004
01:55:46,779 --> 01:55:52,618
Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together,
and he's actin' like he don't know me.

2005
01:55:52,658 --> 01:55:55,618
I know we're supposed to avoid each
other, but there's ways to do things.

2006
01:55:55,658 --> 01:55:57,618
Fuck him.

2007
01:55:57,658 --> 01:56:00,247
To Abraham Lincoln.

2008
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:04,757
- Don't let it bother you.
- Does it look like it's botherin' me?

2009
01:56:04,797 --> 01:56:07,587
Why do I give a fuck?

2010
01:56:07,627 --> 01:56:12,796
That prick. He won't even look over.
What's his fuckin' problem?

2011
01:56:12,846 --> 01:56:17,726
- Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
- They're havin' a good time.

2012
01:56:17,766 --> 01:56:20,806
- So are we.
- # Whip it good ##

2013
01:56:22,475 --> 01:56:26,395
Yeah?

2014
01:56:26,485 --> 01:56:28,985
- Sam, we got a problem.
- What is it?

2015
01:56:29,025 --> 01:56:32,815
The little guy. Nobody told him
he was eighty-sixed from the joint.

2016
01:56:32,905 --> 01:56:35,984
We turned our heads and made out
we didn't know who he was.

2017
01:56:36,034 --> 01:56:40,784
He's over at the 21 table
with his nose wide open.

2018
01:56:40,824 --> 01:56:44,454
He took money out of his own kick.
His nose is open for about 10,000.

2019
01:56:44,494 --> 01:56:47,253
- Now he's really pissed.
- Oh, no.

2020
01:56:47,333 --> 01:56:50,173
- He wants a 50,000 marker.
- Just give him ten.

2021
01:56:50,253 --> 01:56:52,333
That's it.
I'll be right down.

2022
01:56:52,423 --> 01:56:57,512
- He's gonna come up with 10,000, the way you want it.
- No, 50,000. I said 50!

2023
01:56:57,592 --> 01:57:02,642
Go get it. I don't give a fuck where you get
it. Fuckers. They take but don't give back.

2024
01:57:02,682 --> 01:57:06,892
# I ain't got a home
I got a phone ##

2025
01:57:06,972 --> 01:57:11,601
How the fuck can you grin?
How the fuck can you grin?

2026
01:57:11,691 --> 01:57:15,611
You know how much I'm stuck?
You give a fuck? Do you?

2027
01:57:19,030 --> 01:57:22,200
Give yourself a hand,
right across your fuckin' mouth.

2028
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:24,200
Look at this beaut
they put in now.

2029
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:26,205
Sherbert send you
to rob me now?

2030
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:31,209
Been fuckin' knockin' everybody's dick
all night? Been beating the customers?

2031
01:57:31,289 --> 01:57:33,499
Huh, jag-off? Hit me.

2032
01:57:36,209 --> 01:57:39,919
Take this stiff and pound it
up your fuckin' ass.

2033
01:57:39,969 --> 01:57:42,718
Hit me again.

2034
01:57:45,848 --> 01:57:50,728
Take this one and stick it
up your sister's ass. Hit me again.

2035
01:57:50,768 --> 01:57:55,647
That's it. Keep lookin' at him. If you had any
heart at all, you'd be stealin' for a livin'.

2036
01:57:55,727 --> 01:57:59,277
Hit me again! What the fuck
you keep lookin' at him for?

2037
01:57:59,397 --> 01:58:03,197
You fuckin'... Look at this, 20 fuckin'
paints in a row. Hit me again.

2038
01:58:08,326 --> 01:58:12,456
You should pay as fast
as you collect, you know.

2039
01:58:14,956 --> 01:58:19,585
- You gotta get outta here.
- Tell this Jew motherfucker to pay that marker off.

2040
01:58:19,665 --> 01:58:22,755
I'm here to help you.
You're gonna bury us both.

2041
01:58:22,875 --> 01:58:26,795
- Just give me the money. Give me the fuckin' money.
- I'm gonna okay you ten.

2042
01:58:26,885 --> 01:58:29,844
Then you gotta get out
before the cops are all over you.

2043
01:58:29,964 --> 01:58:32,724
Ten and that's it.

2044
01:58:36,264 --> 01:58:40,773
What are you starin' at,
you bald-headed Jew prick?

2045
01:58:44,523 --> 01:58:49,073
- Come on, come on. Let's get outta here.
- Sue me, you Jew fuck!

2046
01:58:49,153 --> 01:58:52,612
Get outta here?
I got a marker comin'. Deal.

2047
01:58:52,742 --> 01:58:55,572
Everything's changed now.
You're talking about a divorce.

2048
01:58:55,662 --> 01:58:59,492
You're asking for alimony payments
and child support, and now custody.

2049
01:58:59,622 --> 01:59:01,911
I just want what any
divorced woman would get.

2050
01:59:02,041 --> 01:59:03,911
She's only sober
about two hours a day.

2051
01:59:04,041 --> 01:59:06,081
It's usually from 11:00 in the morning
'til 1:00 in the afternoon.

2052
01:59:06,171 --> 01:59:10,671
If I gave her her money and her jewels,
she's gonna piss it all away in a year.

2053
01:59:10,711 --> 01:59:14,970
Where would you be then?
Comin' right back to me...

2054
01:59:15,090 --> 01:59:19,810
- or findin' some other excuse to come...
- We had a deal.

2055
01:59:19,930 --> 01:59:21,810
Remember that?

2056
01:59:21,930 --> 01:59:26,349
He said if it didn't work out between us,
I could get my things, and I could leave.

2057
01:59:28,149 --> 01:59:30,439
Look in my eyes.

2058
01:59:30,519 --> 01:59:34,649
Look-Look in my eyes.
You know me.

2059
01:59:34,779 --> 01:59:38,158
Do you see anything that makes
you think I would ever let...

2060
01:59:38,238 --> 01:59:42,578
someone in your condition
take my child away from me?

2061
01:59:42,698 --> 01:59:44,578
Do you?

2062
01:59:47,367 --> 01:59:49,837
You know that won't happen.

2063
01:59:52,337 --> 01:59:55,417
And after all this time...

2064
01:59:55,547 --> 01:59:59,256
and as hard as I tried,
as much as I wanted...

2065
01:59:59,386 --> 02:00:01,256
I could never reach her.

2066
02:00:01,386 --> 02:00:03,466
I could never make
her love me.

2067
02:00:03,556 --> 02:00:07,096
I always felt she should have gone
for all that money...

2068
02:00:07,186 --> 02:00:09,436
being somebody
for the first time in her life...

2069
02:00:09,555 --> 02:00:11,725
a home, a kid.

2070
02:00:11,855 --> 02:00:14,275
That's not what happened.
It didn't work out that way.

2071
02:00:14,395 --> 02:00:16,275
- Everything all right?
I mean, what could we do?

2072
02:00:16,395 --> 02:00:20,275
After a while, we'd just take breathers
from each other. Little separations.

2073
02:00:20,405 --> 02:00:23,984
At that time, I remember Ginger
took Amy to Beverly Hills.

2074
02:00:24,074 --> 02:00:25,944
She was gonna spend
a week shopping.

2075
02:00:26,074 --> 02:00:29,534
- Yes, Mr. Rothstein.
- Operator, the Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills, please.

2076
02:00:29,954 --> 02:00:32,453
- Beverly Hotel.
- Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.

2077
02:00:32,533 --> 02:00:36,123
Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein
have checked out already.

2078
02:00:36,253 --> 02:00:39,003
Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein?

2079
02:00:39,043 --> 02:00:41,843
Hey, little Dale Evans.

2080
02:00:41,923 --> 02:00:44,502
- Yes, they both checked out.
- Thank you.

2081
02:00:49,932 --> 02:00:51,892
Hello. Yeah.

2082
02:00:51,972 --> 02:00:55,061
My wife is with an old friend
of hers in L.A.

2083
02:00:55,101 --> 02:00:57,731
Some lowlife.
A guy named Lester Diamond.

2084
02:00:57,771 --> 02:01:00,601
My daughter is with them, and I think
they're gonna try and kidnap her.

2085
02:01:00,651 --> 02:01:04,441
- Is there anybody you can send?
- We'll take care of it.

2086
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:11,320
We got a number and an address.

2087
02:01:11,410 --> 02:01:15,040
- Hello. Is this Lester?
- Hello.

2088
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:17,410
Who's calling?

2089
02:01:17,450 --> 02:01:20,369
This is Sam Rothstein. I want to talk
to Ginger. Put her on the phone.

2090
02:01:20,459 --> 02:01:22,419
She's not here, Sam.

2091
02:01:22,499 --> 02:01:25,299
Listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.

2092
02:01:25,339 --> 02:01:29,168
I want my kid back.
I want her put on a plane immediately.

2093
02:01:29,298 --> 02:01:32,468
- I know she's there. Don't fuck around.
- Sam, I wouldn't.

2094
02:01:32,508 --> 02:01:34,638
You shouldn't do this.

2095
02:01:34,678 --> 02:01:36,848
- You understand?
Put her on the fuckin' phone.

2096
02:01:36,928 --> 02:01:40,308
Sam, I don't know where she is.

2097
02:01:40,438 --> 02:01:44,607
So... listen...
Can I call you back?

2098
02:01:44,647 --> 02:01:48,277
- 702-472-1862.
- Mm-hmm. 1862.

2099
02:01:48,357 --> 02:01:50,317
- Okay, I'll call you right back.
- Right away.

2100
02:01:50,357 --> 02:01:52,446
- Right back.
- You got it.

2101
02:01:52,486 --> 02:01:56,986
Schmuck. All right,
I just bought us a few minutes.

2102
02:01:57,036 --> 02:01:59,156
You want to get back
at this prick? Hmm?

2103
02:01:59,246 --> 02:02:02,616
- Okay, you got what?
Two million in that box?

2104
02:02:02,706 --> 02:02:05,875
Hey, you got a minute? He's got
two million in the box, am I right?

2105
02:02:05,915 --> 02:02:07,875
You let him
keep your jewels.

2106
02:02:07,915 --> 02:02:11,215
We take the cash and the only other
thing he cares about. Huh? Her majesty.

2107
02:02:11,335 --> 02:02:14,255
We go to Europe.
You dye your hair.

2108
02:02:14,335 --> 02:02:18,054
I don't want to go to Europe.
I want to go to see "The Elephant Man. "

2109
02:02:18,214 --> 02:02:21,764
We're going to Europe.
Let the adults talk. You dye your hair.

2110
02:02:21,844 --> 02:02:24,014
You get plastic surgery
like we talked about.

2111
02:02:24,054 --> 02:02:26,683
You're the mother. How much you think
he'll pay to get this kid back?

2112
02:02:26,723 --> 02:02:29,813
- I don't want to go to Europe.
- Shut your mouth. You know where she gets this?

2113
02:02:29,893 --> 02:02:31,853
- You shut up.
You want me to come over there?

2114
02:02:31,893 --> 02:02:34,023
I'll smack your face.
Don't give me your shit!

2115
02:02:34,063 --> 02:02:37,442
This has always been a dream,
but now we're going.

2116
02:02:37,522 --> 02:02:40,742
- Lester, he called you here. He called you right here.
- That's who was on the phone.

2117
02:02:40,822 --> 02:02:43,242
- I just talked to him.
- So he knows where you are.

2118
02:02:43,282 --> 02:02:45,992
That means he's sending some guys
over here, probably right now.

2119
02:02:46,072 --> 02:02:48,742
It means he's sitting
by the phone, like a dumbbell...

2120
02:02:48,831 --> 02:02:52,751
- waiting for me to call him back.
- He's sitting by the phone just waiting for you to call.

2121
02:02:52,831 --> 02:02:56,711
What do you think we're gonna do? He's
probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!

2122
02:02:56,751 --> 02:03:00,670
- This is fuckin' bullshit! This is bullshit!
- Get your bag! Let's go!

2123
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:05,050
- Oh, what bullshit? What? You want to talk it over now?
- Okay, you done yakkin'?

2124
02:03:05,090 --> 02:03:07,260
- Go, go! Get in the car!
- Go, go, go.

2125
02:03:07,350 --> 02:03:09,350
Just relax.
Nobody's killing anybody.

2126
02:03:09,430 --> 02:03:11,519
I think he's gonna kill me.
- Just relax.

2127
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:16,309
Call me back here in exactly an hour
on this phone. I'll see what I can do.

2128
02:03:16,399 --> 02:03:18,479
I'm gonna call you back
in an hour at this number...

2129
02:03:18,569 --> 02:03:20,779
- and you're gonna be there, right?
- I'll be here.

2130
02:03:20,859 --> 02:03:25,408
Listen, don't do anything else crazy,
okay? You all right? Okay.

2131
02:03:25,528 --> 02:03:27,408
Bye.

2132
02:03:27,528 --> 02:03:29,448
- Just knock it off. You two knock it off.
- She started it.

2133
02:03:29,528 --> 02:03:31,448
- She started the whole thing. I'm just standing here.
- Get in the car.

2134
02:03:31,538 --> 02:03:33,538
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think
you're gonna drive. I'm gonna drive.

2135
02:03:33,618 --> 02:03:36,167
- I'm not gonna drive with some crazy woman.
- You're driving me nuts!

2136
02:03:36,287 --> 02:03:40,087
Get on the passenger side! And I'm
sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!

2137
02:03:56,896 --> 02:03:58,805
Can we...

2138
02:04:05,645 --> 02:04:09,314
# You can go your own way #

2139
02:04:09,364 --> 02:04:12,194
# Go your own way #

2140
02:04:12,284 --> 02:04:14,404
# Tell me why #

2141
02:04:14,494 --> 02:04:18,324
- # Everything turned around #
- Ginger called me.

2142
02:04:18,414 --> 02:04:22,953
Yeah.

2143
02:04:23,003 --> 02:04:26,163
- I just told you she called me.
- What'd she want?

2144
02:04:26,253 --> 02:04:29,923
She was afraid to call you.

2145
02:04:30,003 --> 02:04:35,422
- She's with that cocksucker. They got Amy.
- That's why I'm here.

2146
02:04:35,512 --> 02:04:37,592
She wants to come back, but she's
afraid you're gonna whack her out.

2147
02:04:37,682 --> 02:04:40,932
- They're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
- I know.

2148
02:04:41,012 --> 02:04:45,391
Why didn't you come to me? I mean,
this is family. It ain't business.

2149
02:04:45,481 --> 02:04:49,611
You make calls back home. It makes us
look bad out here. You know what I mean?

2150
02:04:49,691 --> 02:04:51,651
Back and forth,
this one and that one.

2151
02:04:51,691 --> 02:04:53,821
In the meantime,
she's gone anyway.

2152
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:55,990
Am I right?

2153
02:04:56,030 --> 02:04:59,160
What am I going to do
with this woman?

2154
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:03,450
- Driving me fuckin' crazy.
- I think if you, uh...

2155
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:07,919
assure her that she's gonna be
all right, she'll come back.

2156
02:05:07,999 --> 02:05:10,829
Driving me fuckin' crazy.

2157
02:05:10,879 --> 02:05:12,959
Once you get her here,
you think about it.

2158
02:05:13,049 --> 02:05:16,419
Wait 'til you get the kid back.
She wants to come back.

2159
02:05:16,509 --> 02:05:18,838
That's the main thing here.

2160
02:05:18,878 --> 02:05:22,798
You want your kid, don't you?
Huh?

2161
02:05:22,888 --> 02:05:26,848
Hello.

2162
02:05:26,888 --> 02:05:31,727
Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted
to talk to, right?

2163
02:05:31,807 --> 02:05:34,357
Listen, I'm not gonna
ask you where you are.

2164
02:05:34,397 --> 02:05:38,817
Just, please, put Amy on a plane,
any plane, to get her here right away.

2165
02:05:38,897 --> 02:05:41,866
- That's all I'm asking.
- Do you...

2166
02:05:41,906 --> 02:05:44,616
I mean, I don't think
she should go by herself.

2167
02:05:44,696 --> 02:05:48,616
What do you mean?

2168
02:05:48,706 --> 02:05:50,616
What I mean is...

2169
02:05:50,706 --> 02:05:55,795
Do you think if I came back...

2170
02:05:55,875 --> 02:05:58,125
Do you think
you could forgive me?

2171
02:05:58,215 --> 02:06:02,214
I gotta tell you, I don't know.

2172
02:06:02,254 --> 02:06:04,294
I understand that.

2173
02:06:04,384 --> 02:06:06,464
I know I fucked up.

2174
02:06:06,554 --> 02:06:10,724
- What about the money? Where's the box?
- I gotta tell ya...

2175
02:06:10,764 --> 02:06:15,603
I made some mistakes,
and I spent some money.

2176
02:06:15,683 --> 02:06:18,853
- What's it under?
- Pretty serious.

2177
02:06:18,933 --> 02:06:22,102
- How serious?
- It's under 25.

2178
02:06:22,137 --> 02:06:25,272
- It's under 25,000?
- Yeah.

2179
02:06:25,322 --> 02:06:28,112
- The rest of the two million is still there?
- Yeah, I got the rest.

2180
02:06:28,242 --> 02:06:31,322
Okay, no big deal.
That's okay.

2181
02:06:31,412 --> 02:06:33,492
He got his 25.

2182
02:06:33,572 --> 02:06:35,582
That I'll live with.
Any more, I couldn't.

2183
02:06:35,622 --> 02:06:37,791
Okay.

2184
02:06:37,871 --> 02:06:41,211
All right, all right. Where are you?
I'll send a plane for you right away.

2185
02:06:44,791 --> 02:06:46,671
Hi, Sam.

2186
02:06:56,720 --> 02:06:59,639
So what'd you do with it?

2187
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:01,809
With what?

2188
02:07:01,849 --> 02:07:04,189
With the money.

2189
02:07:04,269 --> 02:07:08,609
He needed some clothes.

2190
02:07:08,649 --> 02:07:11,648
25,000 for clothes?

2191
02:07:11,698 --> 02:07:15,318
He wanted a watch too.

2192
02:07:16,868 --> 02:07:20,198
- 25,000 for clothes and a watch?
- Mm-hmm.

2193
02:07:20,288 --> 02:07:22,457
Mm-hmm.

2194
02:07:22,497 --> 02:07:24,877
- Good evening, signora. This way.
- Geno.

2195
02:07:24,917 --> 02:07:27,167
The good part was I had Amy back.

2196
02:07:27,207 --> 02:07:31,717
So we went home, had the housekeeper
stay over, put the kid to bed.

2197
02:07:31,757 --> 02:07:34,506
I calmed myself down,
and we went to dinner.

2198
02:07:34,586 --> 02:07:36,716
I tried to keep things
nice and civil...

2199
02:07:36,756 --> 02:07:41,346
but, hey,
25,000 for three suits?

2200
02:07:41,426 --> 02:07:43,686
That doesn't
make much sense.

2201
02:07:43,726 --> 02:07:47,395
First of all, he's not gonna wear
thousand-dollar suits.

2202
02:07:47,435 --> 02:07:49,685
Let's say he did,
which he won't.

2203
02:07:49,725 --> 02:07:53,195
How you gonna get fitted
for 25 suits in three days?

2204
02:07:53,235 --> 02:07:56,944
- # I'm confessin' #
- I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?

2205
02:07:57,064 --> 02:07:59,364
I can't get fitted that fast,
and I pay twice as much.

2206
02:07:59,444 --> 02:08:02,114
- I bought him a watch too.
- Yeah.

2207
02:08:02,194 --> 02:08:07,413
But even if you bought him a really nice
watch, one that he thought was nice...

2208
02:08:07,493 --> 02:08:09,873
He doesn't know
what the fuck a good watch is.

2209
02:08:09,913 --> 02:08:12,003
- Say you go five, ten, twelve grand...
- Yeah.

2210
02:08:12,043 --> 02:08:15,293
At the most,
which is impossible, for him.

2211
02:08:15,373 --> 02:08:20,132
Plus, at the most, three suits,
1,000 apiece. That still leaves what?

2212
02:08:20,212 --> 02:08:23,672
- Around 10,000?
- Would you knock it off, Sam?

2213
02:08:23,762 --> 02:08:27,802
- I'm just trying to figure it out.
- There's nothing to figure out.

2214
02:08:28,892 --> 02:08:32,181
I'm home.
We're working it out.

2215
02:08:32,271 --> 02:08:35,351
I've been told before,
"We're working it out. "

2216
02:08:35,441 --> 02:08:37,351
You think
that you're home...

2217
02:08:37,441 --> 02:08:41,820
after what you just put me
through with Amy, is a favor to me?

2218
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:51,790
So, counting the watch,
let's say another 4,000...

2219
02:08:51,870 --> 02:08:54,079
for expenses over the weekend...

2220
02:08:54,119 --> 02:08:56,959
of which you must have
had a good time.

2221
02:08:57,039 --> 02:08:58,959
I know he did.
That's for sure.

2222
02:08:58,999 --> 02:09:02,879
I know that fuckin' piece
of shit had a good fuckin' time.

2223
02:09:04,338 --> 02:09:06,928
On my money.

2224
02:09:07,008 --> 02:09:11,508
You might as well have fucked him,
which you probably did anyway.

2225
02:09:11,598 --> 02:09:13,718
You're lookin' at me
a certain way.

2226
02:09:13,768 --> 02:09:17,137
You're teary-eyed, huh?

2227
02:09:17,227 --> 02:09:20,147
You're upset. You're
a good actress, you know that?

2228
02:09:20,227 --> 02:09:22,437
Good fuckin' actress.

2229
02:09:23,857 --> 02:09:25,987
You can fuckin' get
that pity out of people.

2230
02:09:26,067 --> 02:09:27,986
I'm not a john.
You understand?

2231
02:09:28,066 --> 02:09:31,576
You always thought I was,
but I'm not. And I'm not a sucker.

2232
02:09:31,616 --> 02:09:35,496
That fuckin' pimp cocksucker.

2233
02:09:35,576 --> 02:09:37,496
He's lucky I didn't
kill him last time.

2234
02:09:37,616 --> 02:09:40,875
Lucky he's fuckin' livin'.
If you would have stayed with Amy...

2235
02:09:40,955 --> 02:09:42,875
and you would have ran away,
he would have been fuckin' dead.

2236
02:09:42,955 --> 02:09:46,665
Both of you. Dead. Dead.

2237
02:09:46,755 --> 02:09:52,294
# Dreamin' dreams of you
Little babe ##

2238
02:09:54,764 --> 02:09:57,634
No,
it isn't right. It isn't fair.

2239
02:10:00,344 --> 02:10:02,763
Yes.

2240
02:10:02,803 --> 02:10:05,773
He doesn't come home at night.
What is the big fuckin' deal?

2241
02:10:05,813 --> 02:10:08,448
I go... Listen, I just
can't fuckin' take it.

2242
02:10:08,483 --> 02:10:12,153
Why should I fuckin' take it?
That wasn't the deal.

2243
02:10:12,193 --> 02:10:15,612
He acts like I'm the only one
around here with a fuckin' past.

2244
02:10:15,692 --> 02:10:17,612
He'll never let me
live it down.

2245
02:10:17,692 --> 02:10:20,992
Well, yes, I have tried.
Of course I've tried.

2246
02:10:21,032 --> 02:10:23,991
What the fuck do you think
I came back here for?

2247
02:10:24,031 --> 02:10:26,831
No, I'm not.
I want to have him killed.

2248
02:10:26,871 --> 02:10:28,871
Yes, I want him killed.
I've fuckin' had it.

2249
02:10:28,961 --> 02:10:32,671
So are you with me on this?

2250
02:10:32,711 --> 02:10:35,960
You want to get rid of me?
Here I am.

2251
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,970
Go ahead.
Get rid of me.

2252
02:10:38,010 --> 02:10:41,800
- Hello.
- Yes, I do!

2253
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:46,639
I fuckin' hate you!
I can't take it anymore!

2254
02:10:46,679 --> 02:10:50,559
- Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
- You hate my guts?

2255
02:10:50,639 --> 02:10:52,939
- I'm sick of being with you!
- I want you to come with me now!

2256
02:10:53,019 --> 02:10:56,279
Come with me now. Come with me now.

2257
02:10:56,359 --> 02:10:59,278
- I want you out.
I want you out of here.

2258
02:10:59,358 --> 02:11:03,068
- I want you out of here!
I want you out of here!

2259
02:11:04,278 --> 02:11:06,578
Take your fuckin' bag
and get out of here!

2260
02:11:06,658 --> 02:11:08,868
I'll go, but I want
my money right now!

2261
02:11:08,908 --> 02:11:12,417
- You'll get your money! Don't worry.
- The arrangement is over.

2262
02:11:12,497 --> 02:11:15,207
- No kidding!
- And I still get my money.

2263
02:11:15,337 --> 02:11:18,337
I need some cash right now!
You can't just put me in the street!

2264
02:11:18,417 --> 02:11:20,337
You haven't been straight
with me ever since I met you!

2265
02:11:20,417 --> 02:11:22,336
You never even loved me
in the first place!

2266
02:11:22,426 --> 02:11:24,966
I need eyes in the back
of my head with you, you fuckin' bitch!

2267
02:11:25,096 --> 02:11:29,516
How could I love you?
You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!

2268
02:11:29,596 --> 02:11:32,635
- You're lower than a dog!
- Fuck you!

2269
02:11:32,685 --> 02:11:34,975
Here! Here!
Is this enough money?

2270
02:11:35,055 --> 02:11:37,475
Will it last you
two fuckin' days? Take it!

2271
02:11:37,515 --> 02:11:40,815
- Greedy bitch. Take the fuckin' money.
- I'm going to the bank...

2272
02:11:40,895 --> 02:11:44,814
- and I'm getting my jewelry too!
- It opens at 9:00 a. m.

2273
02:11:44,904 --> 02:11:47,444
Don't send your guys down there
to stop me! I mean it!

2274
02:11:47,574 --> 02:11:49,824
I guarantee you,
I will not stop you.

2275
02:11:49,904 --> 02:11:51,824
You're not getting rid of me
with one fucking suitcase!

2276
02:11:51,904 --> 02:11:55,123
Come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Just get out of here. Fine!

2277
02:11:55,203 --> 02:11:57,123
- I'm taking Amy.
- You're not taking Amy.

2278
02:11:57,203 --> 02:11:59,123
I am.
I'm waking her up right now.

2279
02:11:59,243 --> 02:12:01,123
You're stoned. You're a junkie.
Get out of here.

2280
02:12:01,253 --> 02:12:03,173
- I am not! She's my daughter too!
- Get out of here!

2281
02:12:03,253 --> 02:12:05,963
Send my lawyers a letter,
god-fuckin'- damn you!

2282
02:12:06,082 --> 02:12:10,802
You're not getting away with this!
You're not gonna cheat me out of my end!

2283
02:12:10,842 --> 02:12:13,182
Fucker!

2284
02:13:05,057 --> 02:13:09,017
The funny thing was,
after all that, I didn't want her to go.

2285
02:13:09,057 --> 02:13:11,857
She was the mother of my kid.
I loved her.

2286
02:13:11,897 --> 02:13:15,196
And later, I realized I didn't want
to give her the money...

2287
02:13:15,236 --> 02:13:20,526
because if I did,
I knew I'd never see her again.

2288
02:13:30,585 --> 02:13:34,045
- Oh. Have a good day at school, okay?
- Okay.

2289
02:13:34,125 --> 02:13:36,085
Okay, angel.

2290
02:13:40,464 --> 02:13:44,554
From now on, I have to know
where you and Amy are at all times.

2291
02:13:46,304 --> 02:13:48,593
Here's a beeper.

2292
02:13:48,683 --> 02:13:50,803
I want you
to keep it on you.

2293
02:13:50,933 --> 02:13:52,853
It's very light.

2294
02:13:52,933 --> 02:13:55,183
So I can call you
whenever I have to.

2295
02:13:57,773 --> 02:13:59,902
Okay?

2296
02:14:10,782 --> 02:14:12,411
What are you supposed to do?
What do you want to do?

2297
02:14:12,491 --> 02:14:15,411
You want to stay the way you are?
You can't do that.

2298
02:14:15,451 --> 02:14:18,751
Listen, two people don't get along,
at some point you gotta call it.

2299
02:14:18,831 --> 02:14:21,421
It's none of my business,
but I think that's what you gotta do.

2300
02:14:21,501 --> 02:14:23,550
You're right.
I know.

2301
02:14:23,630 --> 02:14:27,380
- I was just...
- What? What?

2302
02:14:27,470 --> 02:14:29,430
- Nothing.
- What were you gonna say?

2303
02:14:29,510 --> 02:14:31,760
- I don't...
- Tell me what you were gonna say.

2304
02:14:31,850 --> 02:14:33,760
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2305
02:14:33,849 --> 02:14:37,269
I was thinking maybe
you know somebody at the bank...

2306
02:14:37,349 --> 02:14:40,099
who could help me
get my jewelry out?

2307
02:14:40,189 --> 02:14:42,269
There's a lot
of money in there.

2308
02:14:42,399 --> 02:14:45,648
I'd be willing to take care
of anybody who helped me out.

2309
02:14:47,028 --> 02:14:49,948
- Let me think about that.
- Okay.

2310
02:14:50,028 --> 02:14:53,908
Let me see who I got. Gotta get
somebody I can trust, you know?

2311
02:14:54,028 --> 02:14:57,117
- You know he's never gonna give me my jewelry.
- Hmm.

2312
02:14:57,157 --> 02:15:00,747
He holds that key so tight,
he's probably got it stuck up his ass.

2313
02:15:00,827 --> 02:15:04,547
You're right. That's Sammy.

2314
02:15:04,667 --> 02:15:06,837
And he's probably
got it there too.

2315
02:15:09,006 --> 02:15:12,586
He's so fuckin' lucky.
I could have buried him.

2316
02:15:12,716 --> 02:15:17,136
I could have gone to Europe
and taken the baby.

2317
02:15:17,216 --> 02:15:21,475
- Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.
- No, he wouldn't.

2318
02:15:21,555 --> 02:15:23,515
I would have.

2319
02:15:23,555 --> 02:15:25,725
- He'd have been right too. Seriously.
- Come on.

2320
02:15:25,855 --> 02:15:29,235
- You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
- I didn't.

2321
02:15:29,275 --> 02:15:32,904
I mean, I did, but then I did exactly
what you told me to do, and I came back.

2322
02:15:33,024 --> 02:15:36,784
- You did. You're right. You did. I like that.
- Exactly what you said.

2323
02:15:36,864 --> 02:15:40,364
- That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
- I did what you told me.

2324
02:15:40,454 --> 02:15:43,783
- Yes, you did.
- Because you always tell me the right thing to do.

2325
02:15:43,913 --> 02:15:45,873
Yeah.

2326
02:15:45,993 --> 02:15:50,083
# And now that it's all over ##

2327
02:15:50,213 --> 02:15:54,332
He really fucked himself up
out here, didn't he?

2328
02:15:54,382 --> 02:15:56,842
- He sure did.
- Everything went to his head.

2329
02:15:58,802 --> 02:16:00,722
- Changed.
- Changed.

2330
02:16:00,802 --> 02:16:04,722
- He did. He ain't the same person.
- No, he's not.

2331
02:16:04,802 --> 02:16:08,561
- He really thinks who the fuck he is.
- Exactly.

2332
02:16:11,481 --> 02:16:13,441
He hates me.

2333
02:16:13,561 --> 02:16:15,521
He hates my fuckin' guts.

2334
02:16:15,651 --> 02:16:19,400
Come on, come on.
You're a toughie. You can take this.

2335
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:26,410
- Don't cry.
- I'm not as tough as you think I am.

2336
02:16:26,490 --> 02:16:28,369
Yes, you are.

2337
02:16:28,489 --> 02:16:30,539
I'm not, and he scares
the shit out of me.

2338
02:16:30,659 --> 02:16:34,079
- I never know what he's gonna do.
- Come on.

2339
02:16:34,169 --> 02:16:38,879
- Don't be scared.
- I need some help. I do.

2340
02:16:38,998 --> 02:16:42,928
I need some help.

2341
02:16:42,968 --> 02:16:44,928
You gotta help me.

2342
02:16:45,008 --> 02:16:47,928
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.

2343
02:16:48,008 --> 02:16:50,058
I do.
I need a new sponsor.

2344
02:16:50,138 --> 02:16:52,017
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.

2345
02:16:52,097 --> 02:16:55,397
- A sponsor?
- Yeah.

2346
02:16:55,477 --> 02:16:59,397
Okay.
Don't worry about it.

2347
02:16:59,437 --> 02:17:01,936
Nobody will fuck
with you anymore.

2348
02:17:01,986 --> 02:17:03,946
- I'll take care of you. Yes, I will.
- Take care of me.

2349
02:17:03,986 --> 02:17:06,736
- It's what you want, isn't it?
- Thank you. Yeah.

2350
02:17:06,776 --> 02:17:09,616
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- It's what you want?

2351
02:17:21,665 --> 02:17:25,214
# Yes, it came from your pen, dear,
but not from your heart #

2352
02:17:25,294 --> 02:17:27,924
- # The third king
The joke of the deck #

2353
02:17:27,964 --> 02:17:30,674
# You ended your letter enclosed
"Please sign my check" #

2354
02:17:30,754 --> 02:17:33,594
- That's Ace's wife.
- # Why, you fool #

2355
02:17:33,674 --> 02:17:37,593
- # You poor, sad, worthless foolish fool #
- Fantastic.

2356
02:17:37,643 --> 02:17:41,773
# If you think that money can pay
for the hard years I've suffered #

2357
02:17:41,813 --> 02:17:43,813
# 'Til things broke your way #

2358
02:17:43,853 --> 02:17:48,612
- This is great for the boss.
- # I'm answering your last letter that says we must part #

2359
02:17:48,652 --> 02:17:52,532
# I'm tearing up the pieces
the way you tore up my heart #

2360
02:17:52,612 --> 02:17:57,072
# I smile when you kiss me
and I thrill at your touch #

2361
02:17:57,162 --> 02:18:01,701
# My only sin was
I loved you much too much #

2362
02:18:01,791 --> 02:18:04,371
# Win a little #

2363
02:18:04,501 --> 02:18:07,211
# Lose a little ##

2364
02:18:15,130 --> 02:18:18,050
- Hi.
- Hi.

2365
02:18:19,970 --> 02:18:22,639
- You didn't answer your beeper.
- I threw it away.

2366
02:18:22,679 --> 02:18:25,389
You threw it away?

2367
02:18:25,479 --> 02:18:27,729
I tried to do this thing. I know that
you want me to, but it's just...

2368
02:18:27,809 --> 02:18:30,519
I'm driving down the freeway and the
fuckin' thing's beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!

2369
02:18:30,559 --> 02:18:33,228
I'm in a restaurant,
it's embarrassing.

2370
02:18:33,318 --> 02:18:36,738
I don't want to do it anymore.
Where's Amy?

2371
02:18:36,818 --> 02:18:39,238
- I put her to bed.
- Oh.

2372
02:18:39,278 --> 02:18:41,238
I got your cigarettes.

2373
02:18:43,908 --> 02:18:45,947
Oscar wants you to call him.

2374
02:18:47,157 --> 02:18:49,957
- So who'd you go to lunch with?
- Jennifer.

2375
02:18:49,997 --> 02:18:52,747
- Where'd you go?
- To the Riviera.

2376
02:18:54,297 --> 02:18:57,046
What'd you have?

2377
02:18:57,086 --> 02:19:01,426
- I had a salad.
- What did Jennifer have?

2378
02:19:01,466 --> 02:19:03,716
She had the same.

2379
02:19:03,806 --> 02:19:06,726
Okay.

2380
02:19:06,765 --> 02:19:08,935
I want you
to call Jennifer...

2381
02:19:08,975 --> 02:19:12,265
and I want you to tell her
to tell you what you had for lunch.

2382
02:19:12,305 --> 02:19:15,105
I'm gonna listen in
on the other line.

2383
02:19:15,185 --> 02:19:18,774
- Why do you want to do that?
- You know why.

2384
02:19:18,814 --> 02:19:21,774
- Just do it.
- Fine.

2385
02:19:21,814 --> 02:19:24,784
I just need to get
the bowl for my thing.

2386
02:19:32,323 --> 02:19:34,243
The line's busy.

2387
02:19:34,333 --> 02:19:36,293
There's nobody there.

2388
02:19:42,672 --> 02:19:45,502
- Hello.
- Hello, Jennifer. It's Sam.

2389
02:19:47,632 --> 02:19:52,761
All right.
I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.

2390
02:19:52,891 --> 02:19:54,811
Okay.

2391
02:19:58,141 --> 02:20:00,441
Who were you with?

2392
02:20:00,521 --> 02:20:02,901
I was with somebody.

2393
02:20:02,981 --> 02:20:07,320
I know you were with somebody.
Who was it?

2394
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:18,079
I just hope it's not someone
who I think it might be.

2395
02:20:19,659 --> 02:20:22,919
I just hope it's not that.

2396
02:20:25,499 --> 02:20:28,008
I knew she fucked around.

2397
02:20:28,048 --> 02:20:30,168
She did what she did,
and I did what I had to do...

2398
02:20:30,218 --> 02:20:35,428
but, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing
she could have done.

2399
02:20:35,508 --> 02:20:38,017
What if he won't stop?

2400
02:20:38,057 --> 02:20:40,097
It could get us both killed.

2401
02:20:40,177 --> 02:20:43,187
I can back him off.

2402
02:20:44,857 --> 02:20:49,107
She was
very convincing when she wanted to be.

2403
02:20:49,186 --> 02:20:51,146
And this is how
she backed him off.

2404
02:20:57,946 --> 02:21:00,156
Hey, Ginger.

2405
02:21:00,286 --> 02:21:02,705
Don't forget,
if you're challenged...

2406
02:21:02,785 --> 02:21:05,705
if he asks anything,
deny everything.

2407
02:21:05,745 --> 02:21:08,545
You understand? I don't want him
bringing beefs back home.

2408
02:21:08,625 --> 02:21:11,874
That could really cause
a serious problem.

2409
02:21:11,914 --> 02:21:13,834
Got to be careful.
He's not dumb, you know?

2410
02:21:13,924 --> 02:21:15,884
You hear what I'm saying, right?

2411
02:21:15,964 --> 02:21:18,054
I know. You don't have
to tell me that.

2412
02:21:18,134 --> 02:21:20,884
What? Do you think I'm stupid?

2413
02:21:20,964 --> 02:21:23,223
Do I think you're stupid? No.

2414
02:21:23,303 --> 02:21:26,143
I think you're beautiful.
But I gotta go.

2415
02:21:29,723 --> 02:21:31,733
By this time, Nicky had things
so fucked up on the streets...

2416
02:21:31,813 --> 02:21:36,562
that every time Marino went back home,
the packages got smaller and smaller.

2417
02:21:38,982 --> 02:21:41,072
It got to the point,
when he walked into the place...

2418
02:21:41,152 --> 02:21:43,902
he didn't know whether he was
going to be kissed or killed.

2419
02:21:43,992 --> 02:21:46,821
Frankie,
I want to ask you something.

2420
02:21:46,911 --> 02:21:48,831
It's private.

2421
02:21:48,911 --> 02:21:50,831
But I want you
to tell me the truth.

2422
02:21:50,911 --> 02:21:53,041
Of course, Remo.

2423
02:21:53,081 --> 02:21:56,581
I want you to tell me
the truth, mind you.

2424
02:21:56,671 --> 02:21:59,750
I always tell you
the truth, Remo.

2425
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:03,090
Frankie... the little guy...

2426
02:22:03,170 --> 02:22:05,260
he wouldn't be fucking
the Jew's wife, would he?

2427
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:09,009
Because if he is,
it's a problem.

2428
02:22:11,179 --> 02:22:13,099
What could I say?

2429
02:22:13,179 --> 02:22:15,099
I knew if I gave
the wrong answer...

2430
02:22:15,189 --> 02:22:19,769
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them
could have wound up gettin' killed.

2431
02:22:19,819 --> 02:22:22,108
Because there's one thing
about these old-timers.

2432
02:22:22,188 --> 02:22:25,108
They don't like any fucking around
with the other guys' wives.

2433
02:22:25,148 --> 02:22:27,158
It's bad for business.

2434
02:22:27,198 --> 02:22:30,448
So I lied, even though I knew
that by lying to Gaggi...

2435
02:22:30,528 --> 02:22:33,287
I could wind up
gettin' killed too.

2436
02:22:33,367 --> 02:22:37,997
- No, I ain't seen anything like that.
- Are you sure?

2437
02:22:38,037 --> 02:22:40,787
I'm positive.

2438
02:22:40,917 --> 02:22:44,966
Remo, things are very
fucked up down there.

2439
02:22:45,046 --> 02:22:47,126
I know.
That's why I'm asking.

2440
02:22:47,176 --> 02:22:49,966
- You see, my main concern is Nicky.
- Mm-hmm.

2441
02:22:50,046 --> 02:22:53,966
I want to know if he's
doing all right, if he's okay.

2442
02:22:54,016 --> 02:22:59,475
- He's good. He's fine.
- I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.

2443
02:22:59,515 --> 02:23:02,435
- Do it for me.
- No problem.

2444
02:23:02,475 --> 02:23:08,314
I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing
anything for our friends. Understand?

2445
02:23:08,404 --> 02:23:10,984
- I understand.
- Okay.

2446
02:23:11,064 --> 02:23:13,614
Frankie, you're a good boy.

2447
02:23:13,654 --> 02:23:15,614
Thanks, Remo.

2448
02:23:15,654 --> 02:23:18,613
By now, Nicky and his crew
had already hit rock bottom.

2449
02:23:18,663 --> 02:23:21,283
Vegas really got to him.

2450
02:23:21,333 --> 02:23:25,123
The booze, the coke, the broads.

2451
02:23:25,163 --> 02:23:27,463
I mean, he got sloppy.

2452
02:23:27,503 --> 02:23:29,462
He just wasn't
the same Nicky anymore.

2453
02:23:29,502 --> 02:23:32,632
- You must have drank too much.
- Go fuck yourself.

2454
02:23:32,712 --> 02:23:34,672
One night he had
to belt a guy three times...

2455
02:23:34,712 --> 02:23:36,637
before the guy
finally went down.

2456
02:23:36,672 --> 02:23:39,012
In the old days, Nicky would have
decked him with one shot.

2457
02:23:39,092 --> 02:23:41,431
You add this into the mix...

2458
02:23:41,511 --> 02:23:44,351
Maybe just Vegas got to all of us.

2459
02:23:44,391 --> 02:23:46,641
His crew followed him
right over the edge.

2460
02:23:46,681 --> 02:23:49,561
They were all tuned up
half the time on coke.

2461
02:23:49,651 --> 02:23:52,610
They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.

2462
02:23:52,690 --> 02:23:55,780
- Hey, what do you guys want?
- Police! Stay in the car!

2463
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:58,200
He never knew
when to keep his mouth shut.

2464
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:00,450
- Drop the gun!
- Fuck you!

2465
02:24:05,079 --> 02:24:07,749
The cops shot Blue...

2466
02:24:07,829 --> 02:24:11,884
- because they thought
his hero sandwich was a gun.

2467
02:24:11,919 --> 02:24:14,248
- They could have been right, but who knows?
- Jesus Christ!

2468
02:24:14,338 --> 02:24:17,088
What gun? He's got
a fuckin' hero sandwich here.

2469
02:24:17,168 --> 02:24:19,258
- What do you want? It's pitch black.
- Pitch black!

2470
02:24:19,338 --> 02:24:22,718
- It's tinfoil. It looked like a gun!
- You fuckin' moron!

2471
02:24:22,798 --> 02:24:25,717
- I'll be fillin' out paperwork for the next two months!
- What are we gonna do?

2472
02:24:25,757 --> 02:24:27,217
- I'm sorry!
- You jerk-off!

2473
02:24:27,347 --> 02:24:30,267
To get even,
Nicky's crew got stoned one night...

2474
02:24:30,347 --> 02:24:32,267
and they started shooting up
the cops' houses.

2475
02:24:44,116 --> 02:24:46,986
It got to the point where they couldn't
talk in the Gold Rush anymore...

2476
02:24:47,076 --> 02:24:49,115
because the Feds
put a wire in the wall.

2477
02:24:49,155 --> 02:24:51,785
Even when they talked outside,
they had to cover their mouths...

2478
02:24:51,825 --> 02:24:54,415
- Shit, he's covering up again.
- Because the Feds brought in lip readers.

2479
02:24:54,455 --> 02:24:58,085
Nicky found out from a teller
who owed him money.

2480
02:24:58,125 --> 02:25:01,084
He asked me again
about you and the Jew's wife.

2481
02:25:01,124 --> 02:25:04,254
Walk, walk, walk.
What'd you say?

2482
02:25:04,294 --> 02:25:07,304
He asked me again about you
and the Jew's wife.

2483
02:25:07,344 --> 02:25:09,474
Yeah?
What'd you tell him?

2484
02:25:09,514 --> 02:25:11,593
I told him
I didn't know nothin'.

2485
02:25:11,633 --> 02:25:15,933
Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said
if you did anything, you're fucked up.

2486
02:25:15,973 --> 02:25:19,773
You think he's going home
making a beef behind my back?

2487
02:25:19,813 --> 02:25:22,312
Nah, you would have
heard something.

2488
02:25:22,352 --> 02:25:27,772
- What's to stop him?
- I know, I know.

2489
02:25:27,862 --> 02:25:31,822
I don't trust him anymore,
but they'd never okay anything.

2490
02:25:31,862 --> 02:25:34,451
Yeah, but they keep
asking about it.

2491
02:25:34,491 --> 02:25:38,451
Sure they're asking.
They earn with the prick.

2492
02:25:38,491 --> 02:25:43,121
I got a funny feeling he's gonna start
a fuckin' war or something.

2493
02:25:43,171 --> 02:25:47,290
I'm not sure yet,
but you know what I want you to do?

2494
02:25:47,380 --> 02:25:49,960
Who's this guy?
Who's this guy?

2495
02:25:50,010 --> 02:25:52,050
That ain't nobody.

2496
02:25:52,130 --> 02:25:54,260
You know what
I want you to do?

2497
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:58,559
Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the
desert, then let them show you where it's at.

2498
02:25:58,639 --> 02:26:02,099
- Angelo and Buster.
- Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.

2499
02:26:02,179 --> 02:26:05,099
- They'll do it.
- When I'm ready, I'll say the word.

2500
02:26:05,189 --> 02:26:08,938
- Go see the Jew, and you make it disappear.
- Yeah.

2501
02:26:09,018 --> 02:26:10,938
Just let me know.
But you got to be ready.

2502
02:26:11,028 --> 02:26:13,568
You know what
I'm talkin' about?

2503
02:26:13,698 --> 02:26:15,568
Did I say
to do anything yet?

2504
02:26:15,698 --> 02:26:18,947
I said I'm not sure. I'll let
you know. I want to think about it.

2505
02:26:19,027 --> 02:26:21,787
Where are these pricks at?
Dominick said they're in the motel?

2506
02:26:21,867 --> 02:26:25,997
There or in the fuckin' bank.
I don't know. All over the joint.

2507
02:26:26,077 --> 02:26:30,626
# Hey, hey, hey That's what I say #

2508
02:26:30,706 --> 02:26:33,086
# I can't get no #

2509
02:26:33,166 --> 02:26:35,756
# Satisfaction #

2510
02:26:35,836 --> 02:26:38,136
# I can't get me no #

2511
02:26:38,216 --> 02:26:40,466
# I can't get no #

2512
02:26:40,556 --> 02:26:45,185
- # And I try and I try
And I try, try, try, try #

2513
02:26:45,225 --> 02:26:49,605
# I can't get no
I can't get me no #

2514
02:26:49,685 --> 02:26:52,065
- # When I'm watchin' my TV #
- Be right back. I'll be right back.

2515
02:26:52,145 --> 02:26:54,734
- # And a man comes on to tell me #
- Rudy.

2516
02:26:54,814 --> 02:26:56,904
Any calls for me, just give them
to Mr. Sherbert. I'll be right back.

2517
02:26:56,984 --> 02:26:59,734
- Sure, Mr. Rothstein.
- I'm going home for a few seconds.

2518
02:26:59,824 --> 02:27:01,734
# Same cigarettes as me #

2519
02:27:01,824 --> 02:27:05,903
- # I can't get no
No, no, no #

2520
02:27:05,993 --> 02:27:08,033
# Hey, hey, hey #

2521
02:27:08,123 --> 02:27:11,953
- # That's what I say #
- He's on his way home.

2522
02:27:12,043 --> 02:27:15,753
- Oh... okay.
- # And I'm doing this And I'm trying that #

2523
02:27:15,832 --> 02:27:18,042
# And I'm trying
to make some dough #

2524
02:27:18,172 --> 02:27:20,422
# Baby, baby, baby
baby, baby, baby #

2525
02:27:20,502 --> 02:27:23,092
- # Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby, baby #
- Hello?

2526
02:27:23,172 --> 02:27:26,592
- # Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby, baby ##
- Hello? Ginger?

2527
02:27:26,632 --> 02:27:29,181
- Help, Daddy!
- Amy!

2528
02:27:29,261 --> 02:27:32,931
- Amy, open the door!
- I can't! I'm tied!

2529
02:27:37,141 --> 02:27:39,100
- Dad!
- What happened?

2530
02:27:39,190 --> 02:27:41,400
- Who did this to you?
- Mommy.

2531
02:27:41,480 --> 02:27:43,780
I'm gonna get a knife
and cut you loose, honey.

2532
02:27:43,860 --> 02:27:46,900
- No, please, please!
- Okay, Papa will be right back.

2533
02:27:46,950 --> 02:27:49,949
- When did this happen, honey?
- I don't know.

2534
02:27:50,029 --> 02:27:52,739
What time did your mother
do this? When did she leave?

2535
02:27:52,789 --> 02:27:54,749
I don't know.

2536
02:28:02,128 --> 02:28:03,998
- Hello?
- Sammy.

2537
02:28:04,128 --> 02:28:06,048
- Yeah. Who's this? Nick?
- Me.

2538
02:28:06,128 --> 02:28:08,428
- Yeah. You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

2539
02:28:08,468 --> 02:28:11,758
- How'd you know I was here?
- I just wanted to talk to you.

2540
02:28:11,798 --> 02:28:14,057
Ginger's missing. She tied Amy up
and locked her in her room.

2541
02:28:14,137 --> 02:28:16,057
I gotta find her.
I don't know where she is.

2542
02:28:16,137 --> 02:28:19,267
Well, listen, Ginger's here
at the Leaning Tower with me.

2543
02:28:19,307 --> 02:28:21,267
She's there with you?
She's there with you?

2544
02:28:21,307 --> 02:28:23,647
- Yeah, she's here.
- I'll be right over.

2545
02:28:23,727 --> 02:28:27,396
Uh, all right.

2546
02:28:27,436 --> 02:28:31,446
- Comin' over.
- Great.

2547
02:28:35,365 --> 02:28:38,325
Ace, listen,
don't make a scene, all right?

2548
02:28:38,405 --> 02:28:41,245
- I want to just talk to that Irish bitch.
- She didn't know who to turn to.

2549
02:28:41,325 --> 02:28:43,285
She didn't know where to turn.
She's trying to save your marriage.

2550
02:28:43,335 --> 02:28:46,455
- Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
- Hey.

2551
02:28:46,505 --> 02:28:49,294
Be fuckin' nice. Calm.

2552
02:28:49,334 --> 02:28:54,964
Be nice.
Don't fuck up in here.

2553
02:29:00,883 --> 02:29:03,433
# I'll throw off my sorrow ##

2554
02:29:03,513 --> 02:29:05,973
- Hi, Sam.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

2555
02:29:06,063 --> 02:29:10,102
You tie up our kid and lock the
fucking door? Are you out of your mind?

2556
02:29:10,232 --> 02:29:12,312
That's our child.
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

2557
02:29:12,402 --> 02:29:15,522
It was just for a little while,
Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.

2558
02:29:15,652 --> 02:29:18,942
I ought to fuckin' have you committed.
You fuckin' do that again, I'll...

2559
02:29:19,072 --> 02:29:21,531
- I was just gonna be out for a little while.
- I should have...

2560
02:29:21,661 --> 02:29:25,201
- She was asleep. I was gonna be right back...
- Listen.

2561
02:29:25,331 --> 02:29:27,741
- Before she even woke up.
- Listen, you fuckin' cunt. Listen to me.

2562
02:29:27,871 --> 02:29:29,751
- Fuck you. I was gonna be back...
- Let me tell you something.

2563
02:29:29,871 --> 02:29:32,370
- Before she woke up.
- Listen to me. Listen carefully.

2564
02:29:32,460 --> 02:29:34,590
You ever touch her again, you ever
do anything like that again...

2565
02:29:34,710 --> 02:29:36,670
I'll fuckin' kill ya,
pure and simple.

2566
02:29:36,750 --> 02:29:38,670
You hear me?
Pure and fuckin' simple.

2567
02:29:38,710 --> 02:29:40,840
- Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
- I'll fuckin' kill you.

2568
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:43,929
- You fuckin' whore.
- I'll sign anything you want me to sign.

2569
02:29:44,009 --> 02:29:46,679
I just want the key to my jewelry,
and I want you to let me go.

2570
02:29:46,759 --> 02:29:48,679
- You want your jewelry?
- I want you to let me go.

2571
02:29:48,769 --> 02:29:50,679
And let you disgrace me,
you fuckin' pig?

2572
02:29:50,769 --> 02:29:52,769
Let you disgrace me?
Get up and be a mother.

2573
02:29:52,899 --> 02:29:55,148
Get in the car and go
to the house right now.

2574
02:29:55,268 --> 02:29:59,148
Get up and get in the...
Get... Get up. Get up!

2575
02:29:59,278 --> 02:30:02,108
- Get up. Get up.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

2576
02:30:02,238 --> 02:30:03,858
- I wouldn't do that...
- Get up!

2577
02:30:03,948 --> 02:30:05,908
- I wouldn't do that...
- Get the fuck... Are you threatening me?

2578
02:30:06,028 --> 02:30:08,947
I'll fuckin' kill you in this place.
Get up and go home.

2579
02:30:09,077 --> 02:30:10,907
- I'm going! I'm going!
- You...

2580
02:30:17,207 --> 02:30:20,126
- Now you need approval from him to go home?
- So what?

2581
02:30:20,206 --> 02:30:22,876
So who fuckin' blew you
in the parking lot before you came in?

2582
02:30:22,966 --> 02:30:25,136
- Huh?
- You make me sick, you fuckin'...

2583
02:30:25,256 --> 02:30:27,636
- Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
- Oh, fuck you!

2584
02:30:27,756 --> 02:30:32,885
- Fuck you, Sam Rothstein! Fuck you!
- # I can't get no satisfaction #

2585
02:30:32,975 --> 02:30:34,935
# I can't get me no
satisfaction #

2586
02:30:35,015 --> 02:30:37,305
# I can't get no
satisfaction #

2587
02:30:37,435 --> 02:30:40,684
- # I can't get me no satisfaction #
- Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please.

2588
02:30:40,814 --> 02:30:42,774
- Who's this?
- Billy, listen, I'll explain later.

2589
02:30:42,894 --> 02:30:45,654
- You got a gun at home? Bring it over right away.
- Yeah.

2590
02:30:45,774 --> 02:30:48,024
- Take it easy. I'll do it.
- Okay.

2591
02:30:48,194 --> 02:30:50,824
# No-no-no-no-no
satisfaction #

2592
02:30:50,904 --> 02:30:53,653
- # No-no-no-no, I can't get me no
satisfaction # - Leave it where it is!

2593
02:30:53,743 --> 02:30:56,663
# I can't get no
satisfaction ##

2594
02:30:56,743 --> 02:30:59,033
Where is he? Goddamn it,
I want that Jew bastard killed!

2595
02:30:59,163 --> 02:31:01,043
Calm down. Shh.
Hide her car in the back.

2596
02:31:01,163 --> 02:31:05,462
There's no reason to hide my car!
He already knows!

2597
02:31:05,502 --> 02:31:08,252
What did I tell you? Supposin' he goes
back home and makes a fuckin' beef?

2598
02:31:08,342 --> 02:31:11,922
- I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said.
- Me? I said nothing.

2599
02:31:12,012 --> 02:31:15,931
I said, "No, no, no. " Everything
he said, I just kept saying no.

2600
02:31:16,011 --> 02:31:17,891
I told you this was
fuckin' dangerous.

2601
02:31:18,011 --> 02:31:21,931
I said, "Ginger, this is a dangerous
situation. Be very careful. "

2602
02:31:22,021 --> 02:31:24,561
If it's so fucking dangerous,
then why don't you kill him?

2603
02:31:24,641 --> 02:31:27,020
I'm not gonna kill him.
Shut the fuck up.

2604
02:31:27,060 --> 02:31:30,820
- Have him killed, and get it over with!
- Don't be such a smart-ass!

2605
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:34,490
I know the guy 35 years,
I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?

2606
02:31:34,530 --> 02:31:38,119
Motherfucker.

2607
02:31:38,199 --> 02:31:42,579
- I knew this. I knew it.
- What about my money?

2608
02:31:42,659 --> 02:31:45,039
How the fuck am I gonna
get your money now?

2609
02:31:45,159 --> 02:31:47,619
You think he's gonna give you
fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?

2610
02:31:47,749 --> 02:31:49,588
- Look what you did to this fuckin' guy?
- What?

2611
02:31:49,748 --> 02:31:52,088
If you would have just
kept your fuckin' mouth shut.

2612
02:31:52,168 --> 02:31:54,668
What the fuck is the use! I should've
never got involved...

2613
02:31:54,718 --> 02:32:00,008
Hey! Hey! You motherfucker, you!

2614
02:32:00,048 --> 02:32:04,217
Ow! You fuck! You fucker!
Get out! Get the fuck out!

2615
02:32:04,267 --> 02:32:07,767
Get out! Get the fuck out!

2616
02:32:07,897 --> 02:32:10,017
- No! No!
- Get down there! Take it easy!

2617
02:32:10,187 --> 02:32:12,686
I should never have gotten involved
with this fucking nut!

2618
02:32:12,816 --> 02:32:15,066
You'll fuckin' kill her.
Take it easy.

2619
02:32:15,106 --> 02:32:17,696
- Get her out of here.
Get her out of here.

2620
02:32:17,736 --> 02:32:19,986
Let's go. Let's go.

2621
02:32:23,405 --> 02:32:27,615
I don't need you!
I'll get my own fucking money!

2622
02:32:27,745 --> 02:32:31,535
- All right.
- I'm going to the F.B.I.! I'm not scared anymore!

2623
02:32:31,585 --> 02:32:35,164
- All right. Be careful.
- You've fucked with me for the last time!

2624
02:32:35,254 --> 02:32:37,964
Okay. Yeah.

2625
02:32:38,044 --> 02:32:41,714
Be careful. Come on. Get inside.

2626
02:32:41,754 --> 02:32:46,513
- Can you believe that?
- Look at this motherfucker.

2627
02:32:46,593 --> 02:32:48,513
Whew.

2628
02:32:48,553 --> 02:32:52,553
I fucked up, Frankie.
I fucked up good this time.

2629
02:32:52,603 --> 02:32:55,893
I should never have started
with this fuckin' broad.

2630
02:32:55,933 --> 02:32:58,392
Take it easy.
What could you do?

2631
02:32:58,442 --> 02:33:01,402
I mean, she threw herself
at you, right?

2632
02:33:03,942 --> 02:33:09,661
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here.
You know that?

2633
02:33:09,781 --> 02:33:14,331
A bad fuckin' spot.

2634
02:33:26,550 --> 02:33:28,550
I'd already left
the kid with neighbors...

2635
02:33:28,630 --> 02:33:30,550
and I had about a million
in cash and jewels...

2636
02:33:30,630 --> 02:33:32,969
that I gave to Sherbert
to lock up in the hotel.

2637
02:33:33,049 --> 02:33:35,849
Put it in the hotel safe,
then I want you to come right back.

2638
02:34:08,546 --> 02:34:10,756
- She's alone.
Take the gun and go into Amy's...

2639
02:34:10,796 --> 02:34:15,176
- Wait there for me.
Get out here and talk to me!

2640
02:34:15,216 --> 02:34:19,095
You fuckin' ignore me,
you motherfucker!

2641
02:34:19,175 --> 02:34:23,765
I mean it!
Come down here right now!

2642
02:34:23,845 --> 02:34:27,475
Get down here
and talk to me, goddamn it!

2643
02:34:27,515 --> 02:34:29,894
Fuck you!
Goddamn you, come out here!

2644
02:34:29,984 --> 02:34:33,444
I'm going to drive your fucking
car through the living room!

2645
02:34:33,524 --> 02:34:38,904
You fucking coward!
You motherfucker!

2646
02:34:38,984 --> 02:34:42,573
- Come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
- Will you stop it?

2647
02:34:42,653 --> 02:34:44,743
- You're drunk. You're on drugs.
- I am not!

2648
02:34:44,823 --> 02:34:48,953
- You're going to be sorry if you don't stop it.
- Don't you threaten me!

2649
02:34:49,043 --> 02:34:52,752
You are not
threatening me anymore!

2650
02:34:52,792 --> 02:34:56,672
You fuck! You fuck!
I'm sick of you!

2651
02:34:56,712 --> 02:35:01,092
I am fucking Nicky Santoro!
I am! He's my new sponsor!

2652
02:35:01,172 --> 02:35:03,761
How about that, you fuckhead!

2653
02:35:03,841 --> 02:35:05,841
What are you looking at?
Fuck off!

2654
02:35:05,931 --> 02:35:09,601
Hey. Go back inside!
This is none of your business!

2655
02:35:09,681 --> 02:35:12,271
I don't have to take your shit
all the time anymore!

2656
02:35:12,311 --> 02:35:14,810
I'm going to the F.B.I.!
I will go to the police!

2657
02:35:14,900 --> 02:35:18,270
- I am not protecting you anymore, you fuck!
- Mrs. Rothstein... Shh.

2658
02:35:18,320 --> 02:35:21,400
He won't let me inside!

2659
02:35:21,490 --> 02:35:26,239
Mr. Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've been
getting some complaints about the noise.

2660
02:35:26,279 --> 02:35:29,079
- I'm trying to get in my house. He won't let me in.
- I understand.

2661
02:35:29,159 --> 02:35:31,449
I won't let her in. I'm sorry,
Randy, I'm not gonna let her in.

2662
02:35:31,499 --> 02:35:34,039
- I'm not gonna let her in the way she's behaving.
- Not gonna let me in?

2663
02:35:34,079 --> 02:35:36,248
- Who knows what you're gonna do in there.
- What am I gonna do?

2664
02:35:36,288 --> 02:35:38,248
I've been in the same
clothes for two days!

2665
02:35:38,288 --> 02:35:40,668
- I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
- Okay.

2666
02:35:40,748 --> 02:35:43,588
How about if we just let her
in the house to get a few things?

2667
02:35:43,628 --> 02:35:45,758
- This is half her house anyway.
- I'm afraid to let her in the house.

2668
02:35:45,838 --> 02:35:47,927
You aren't afraid, you fucker!
- I'm afraid she'll destroy stuff.

2669
02:35:47,967 --> 02:35:50,967
- Let me in the house!
- Hey, hey, hey!

2670
02:35:51,057 --> 02:35:53,347
- Fucker! Fucker!
Hold on! Hey! Please!

2671
02:35:53,427 --> 02:35:55,347
You ought to be afraid,
the way you fuckin' treat me!

2672
02:35:55,437 --> 02:35:59,016
- It'll make it easier...
- If we let her get her things...

2673
02:35:59,106 --> 02:36:02,066
- we'll be out of your hair.
- If she calms down, I will let her in the house...

2674
02:36:02,146 --> 02:36:06,066
- I am calm!
- If she calms down...

2675
02:36:06,156 --> 02:36:08,066
I will let her in the house
for five minutes...

2676
02:36:08,156 --> 02:36:12,195
if you gentlemen will escort her out
if she happens to not want to leave.

2677
02:36:12,325 --> 02:36:14,195
- Can I go in? Can I go in?
- That's not a problem.

2678
02:36:14,325 --> 02:36:17,575
- Jeff, would you go in with her?
- Yes. Yes. Fine! Fuck you!

2679
02:36:20,785 --> 02:36:24,164
You wouldn't believe how mean he's been to
me. He's locked up most of my important stuff.

2680
02:36:24,254 --> 02:36:26,714
All my papers and things... I have to
get them. So don't let him come up here.

2681
02:36:26,754 --> 02:36:30,504
I know they're in here
in the desk... Fuck.

2682
02:36:33,263 --> 02:36:36,303
Just pay attention.
He could come up here at any time.

2683
02:36:39,553 --> 02:36:41,763
Are you watching for him?

2684
02:36:43,473 --> 02:36:45,182
Got 'em.

2685
02:36:45,232 --> 02:36:48,352
I don't want her in there
more than a few more minutes.

2686
02:36:48,482 --> 02:36:51,652
No, it'll just be a couple...
We got other things to do too.

2687
02:36:54,862 --> 02:36:57,151
I'll hurry her up.

2688
02:36:57,281 --> 02:36:59,741
- How's everything else besides this?
- Fine. Fine.

2689
02:36:59,821 --> 02:37:03,991
- How's your family?
- Not bad. In fact, my wife's pregnant again.

2690
02:37:04,121 --> 02:37:07,830
- Oh, good. Congratulations.
- Thanks. Yeah.

2691
02:37:07,870 --> 02:37:09,830
We're kind of happy
about that.

2692
02:37:09,960 --> 02:37:13,550
I just have to get this one more
thing and then we can go.

2693
02:37:13,590 --> 02:37:15,550
Shit! Fuck!

2694
02:37:15,590 --> 02:37:18,220
Shit! God!

2695
02:37:18,260 --> 02:37:21,259
Oh, that pisses me off!
Don't worry about it.

2696
02:37:21,349 --> 02:37:23,809
And it would be great...

2697
02:37:23,889 --> 02:37:25,809
if you guys could just
follow me out of here...

2698
02:37:25,889 --> 02:37:28,099
because he's been
threatening me!

2699
02:37:28,189 --> 02:37:30,848
Take care. Thank you.

2700
02:37:49,367 --> 02:37:52,746
I can't believe this.

2701
02:38:02,586 --> 02:38:05,635
I just need to pick up a little cash
inside. Could you come with me?

2702
02:38:11,725 --> 02:38:15,894
- Charlie, you've got to stop her. You've got to stop her.
- I'm sorry, Sam.

2703
02:38:15,934 --> 02:38:19,064
- What can I do?
- She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind!

2704
02:38:19,104 --> 02:38:21,564
She has the keys.
It's still in both your names.

2705
02:38:21,604 --> 02:38:24,114
- Oh!
- There's nothing I can do. I'd like to help...

2706
02:38:24,194 --> 02:38:26,234
- but I can't.
- Legally, she can't take that stuff.

2707
02:38:26,284 --> 02:38:28,943
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Half
of everything is mine. Ace, listen to me.

2708
02:38:28,993 --> 02:38:30,953
- There's nothing I can do.
- Half... I'm coming down.

2709
02:38:44,752 --> 02:38:48,302
Shit! Goddamn it!

2710
02:38:48,382 --> 02:38:51,971
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could
just ask the guy for the big bag.

2711
02:38:52,051 --> 02:38:54,641
- Go get a bag, man.
- Here, here.

2712
02:38:54,721 --> 02:38:59,481
- Lady, I can't take it.
- No, you can, you can. You've been so nice to me.

2713
02:38:59,561 --> 02:39:02,980
- Yes, just hold the top open.
All right? And I can...

2714
02:39:06,270 --> 02:39:08,980
Oh, God, it's him.
You have to stop him.

2715
02:39:09,070 --> 02:39:13,159
He said he was gonna kill me.
You should just stop him.

2716
02:39:13,199 --> 02:39:15,779
Mr. Roth... Mr. Roth...
Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.

2717
02:39:15,819 --> 02:39:17,789
Hold on a second. Hey.

2718
02:39:17,829 --> 02:39:21,159
- She's driving away.
There's nothing we can do.

2719
02:39:21,209 --> 02:39:24,078
- There's nothing we can do.
- Look, look, look.

2720
02:39:24,168 --> 02:39:27,248
You can't stop her for speeding?
Look what she's doing.

2721
02:39:27,338 --> 02:39:31,418
- There's nothing we can do. She had the keys.
- She's on the account.

2722
02:39:31,508 --> 02:39:33,968
- Let's pull her over at that Citgo station.
- Okay. Let's do it.

2723
02:39:45,397 --> 02:39:49,066
- We're placing you under arrest for...
- For what?

2724
02:39:49,186 --> 02:39:52,106
- We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting...
- For what?

2725
02:39:52,186 --> 02:39:55,446
- We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting...
- But I'm just trying to leave.

2726
02:39:56,026 --> 02:39:58,075
After all
the threats and all the bullshit...

2727
02:39:58,115 --> 02:40:00,235
it turned out Ginger
didn't tell them anything.

2728
02:40:00,325 --> 02:40:03,745
- But, by then, the Feds didn't need her anyway.
- But it was mine.

2729
02:40:03,865 --> 02:40:07,495
- They had all the pieces they needed.
- But I didn't do anything.

2730
02:40:07,535 --> 02:40:12,504
- Everybody began to tumble, one after the other, like dominoes.
- F.B.I.! We have a warrant!

2731
02:40:12,584 --> 02:40:14,584
Between Piscano
complaining on the wire...

2732
02:40:14,674 --> 02:40:18,094
between Nicky, Ginger,
me and my license...

2733
02:40:18,174 --> 02:40:22,133
- Paradise. We managed
to really fuck it all up.

2734
02:40:22,213 --> 02:40:25,433
- Mom.
- Yeah, someone's at the fuckin' door now.

2735
02:40:25,513 --> 02:40:27,433
F.B.I. We have
a federal search warrant.

2736
02:40:27,473 --> 02:40:30,643
I got wind of the pinches
coming down, so I took off.

2737
02:40:30,723 --> 02:40:32,732
Who needs to hang around
for that bullshit?

2738
02:40:32,772 --> 02:40:34,732
- My name is Mark Casper. Special Agent F.B.I.
- Yeah?

2739
02:40:34,772 --> 02:40:36,732
- Can I make a fuckin' phone call?
- Hey, hold it a minute.

2740
02:40:36,812 --> 02:40:39,362
You can make a phone call, but you
don't have to talk to us like that.

2741
02:40:39,402 --> 02:40:42,402
Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.

2742
02:40:42,442 --> 02:40:46,071
They got almost everybody else.
- This area is seized!

2743
02:40:46,161 --> 02:40:50,831
- Get the master account list.
- I want all those papers seized regardless of what they are.

2744
02:40:54,790 --> 02:40:57,120
Put every box on the table.

2745
02:41:02,250 --> 02:41:05,420
Ah, yes. Here we are.
Little craps figures.

2746
02:41:05,470 --> 02:41:07,429
Green? Don't even ask.

2747
02:41:07,469 --> 02:41:10,889
- $30,000 of yours.
- No, he didn't. That's why it wasn't valid.

2748
02:41:10,929 --> 02:41:14,219
I was being extorted. I'm willing
to tell you whatever you want to know.

2749
02:41:14,309 --> 02:41:16,229
- I've got nothing to hide here.
- Now for the best.

2750
02:41:16,309 --> 02:41:20,688
I couldn't believe this shit.
Piscano's expense reports took the cake.

2751
02:41:20,768 --> 02:41:24,438
- Oh, this is good. Bingo.
- He might as well have given them a fuckin' blueprint.

2752
02:41:24,488 --> 02:41:27,818
Everybody's names, addresses,
dates, everything.

2753
02:41:27,908 --> 02:41:31,527
Look at this. Thank you so much,
Mr. Piscano. How considerate of you.

2754
02:41:31,617 --> 02:41:34,447
- Those are my mother's books.
- You're under arrest.

2755
02:41:34,537 --> 02:41:36,957
What a fuckin' balloon-head.
- What are you guys doing?

2756
02:41:37,037 --> 02:41:39,247
- Take it easy.
- Wait!

2757
02:41:39,287 --> 02:41:41,246
- Wait a minute! He's sick! Oh, God!
- Move back.

2758
02:41:41,286 --> 02:41:43,916
- I think it's his heart! Oh, God! Is he breathing?
- C.P.R. Now!

2759
02:41:43,956 --> 02:41:46,006
Poor Artie. He got so upset,
he had a heart attack...

2760
02:41:46,086 --> 02:41:48,376
and dropped dead right
in front of his wife.

2761
02:41:48,466 --> 02:41:50,601
- Calm down!
- Artie! No, I won't calm down!

2762
02:41:50,636 --> 02:41:52,755
- He's my husband! Artie! Artie!
- We can't help him if...

2763
02:41:55,885 --> 02:41:57,805
And at the end of the day...

2764
02:41:57,885 --> 02:42:00,435
they finally came to see me
with the pictures.

2765
02:42:00,475 --> 02:42:03,264
Why protect a friend
who betrayed you like that?

2766
02:42:03,354 --> 02:42:05,274
But I didn't want to look at them.

2767
02:42:05,314 --> 02:42:07,854
I didn't want to look at the guys
who brought them either.

2768
02:42:10,564 --> 02:42:14,114
Your Honor, as you can see,
my clients are elderly and infirm.

2769
02:42:14,153 --> 02:42:17,323
Any incarceration could
pose a serious health risk.

2770
02:42:17,363 --> 02:42:19,613
When the bosses were arrested,
some of them were so old...

2771
02:42:19,703 --> 02:42:21,663
they needed doctors
at their arraignment.

2772
02:42:21,703 --> 02:42:24,743
Pre-trial Services recommends
that bail remain as presently set.

2773
02:42:24,833 --> 02:42:27,542
- We're going to take a recess.
- When it looked like they could get...

2774
02:42:27,582 --> 02:42:30,622
25 years to life in prison
just for skimmin' a casino...

2775
02:42:30,712 --> 02:42:33,842
sick or no fuckin' sick, you knew
people were going to get clipped.

2776
02:42:33,882 --> 02:42:39,261
So, the day of the arraignment, they had this
meeting right in the back of the courthouse.

2777
02:42:39,341 --> 02:42:43,801
See, when something like this happens,
you know how things are gonna work out.

2778
02:42:43,851 --> 02:42:48,101
It's always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?

2779
02:42:48,181 --> 02:42:50,980
He won't talk.
Stone is a good kid.

2780
02:42:51,060 --> 02:42:53,270
Stand-up guy
just like his old man.

2781
02:42:53,360 --> 02:42:55,650
That's the way I see it.

2782
02:42:55,730 --> 02:42:59,570
I agree. He's solid.
He's a fuckin' Marine.

2783
02:42:59,649 --> 02:43:04,069
He's okay. He always was.
Remo, what do you think?

2784
02:43:05,369 --> 02:43:10,659
Look... why take a chance?

2785
02:43:10,749 --> 02:43:14,038
At least, that's the way
I feel about it.

2786
02:43:14,128 --> 02:43:17,838
Call Artie. Tell him,
I don't care what...

2787
02:43:17,878 --> 02:43:20,968
- he's got to be in my office Thursday morning before 11:00.
- It's done.

2788
02:43:21,088 --> 02:43:24,257
It's terribly important. I gotta have
a conversation with that guy...

2789
02:43:32,437 --> 02:43:35,146
As much as they liked him,
I mean, he wasn't one of us.

2790
02:43:35,226 --> 02:43:38,476
He wasn't Italian. As far as they knew,
he could have talked.

2791
02:43:38,606 --> 02:43:41,106
Otherwise,
Stoney might still be alive.

2792
02:43:45,026 --> 02:43:47,785
The first one to skip
was John Nance.

2793
02:43:47,865 --> 02:43:50,995
He found a nice, warm,
secluded place in Costa Rica.

2794
02:43:51,075 --> 02:43:54,535
- He thought nobody
would find him there.

2795
02:44:14,473 --> 02:44:17,393
But then his kid got nabbed
by the Feds for drugs.

2796
02:44:17,473 --> 02:44:20,392
So, naturally, the bosses were
afraid he'd come out of hiding...

2797
02:44:20,472 --> 02:44:23,062
just to save his kid
and give them all up.

2798
02:44:23,192 --> 02:44:25,062
So...

2799
02:44:27,902 --> 02:44:31,441
Where you goin', jag-off?

2800
02:44:31,531 --> 02:44:33,531
But, anyway,
they all had to follow.

2801
02:44:33,651 --> 02:44:36,491
Everybody went down.

2802
02:44:36,621 --> 02:44:38,491
Fuck you.

2803
02:44:41,291 --> 02:44:43,160
Before you knew it...

2804
02:44:43,290 --> 02:44:46,750
anybody who knew anything
wound up gettin' whacked.

2805
02:44:55,179 --> 02:44:57,589
Oh, no! No! No!

2806
02:45:02,309 --> 02:45:05,058
After Ginger took off,
she wasn't much help to anybody.

2807
02:45:05,188 --> 02:45:09,018
She found some pimps, lowlifes,
druggies and bikers in L.A.

2808
02:45:09,108 --> 02:45:12,648
In a few months, they went through
all the money and all the jewels.

2809
02:45:38,046 --> 02:45:40,795
After they found her body...

2810
02:45:40,885 --> 02:45:44,135
I had a private doctor
do another autopsy.

2811
02:45:46,725 --> 02:45:49,805
He said they gave her
a hot dose.

2812
02:45:49,895 --> 02:45:55,734
In the end, all she had left was 3,600
in mint condition coins.

2813
02:46:16,662 --> 02:46:20,882
No matter what the Feds or the papers
might have said about my car bombing...

2814
02:46:20,962 --> 02:46:23,712
it was amateur night,
you could tell.

2815
02:46:23,802 --> 02:46:28,181
Whoever it was, they put
the dynamite under the passenger side.

2816
02:46:28,301 --> 02:46:31,801
But what they didn't know,
what nobody outside the factory knew...

2817
02:46:31,851 --> 02:46:37,180
was that that model car was made with
a metal plate under the driver's seat.

2818
02:46:37,270 --> 02:46:40,100
It's the only thing
that saved my life.

2819
02:46:52,159 --> 02:46:56,409
The bombing was never authorized,
but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.

2820
02:46:56,829 --> 02:46:59,208
- Hey, Nicky.
And so did the powers that be.

2821
02:46:59,328 --> 02:47:01,998
- How are you?
- How you doin'?

2822
02:47:02,078 --> 02:47:03,958
It took months
for everything to calm down.

2823
02:47:04,088 --> 02:47:05,958
But, finally,
my guys got out on bail...

2824
02:47:06,088 --> 02:47:09,927
and the bosses wanted me to send
my brother Dominick out to Vegas.

2825
02:47:10,007 --> 02:47:12,297
Always the dollars.
Always the fuckin' dollars.

2826
02:47:12,427 --> 02:47:16,887
I mean, it was still way too hot
for me to even go near Vegas.

2827
02:47:16,967 --> 02:47:19,937
So I set up a meeting
with the guys way out in the sticks.

2828
02:47:20,017 --> 02:47:23,016
I didn't want my brother to get fucked
around. I mean, what's right is right.

2829
02:47:23,106 --> 02:47:25,476
They don't give a fuck about...

2830
02:47:26,316 --> 02:47:28,186
Holy fuckin'!

2831
02:47:28,316 --> 02:47:30,446
What the fuck...

2832
02:47:30,526 --> 02:47:32,815
Come on, motherfucker!

2833
02:47:32,945 --> 02:47:35,825
- Tough guys!
You and your fuckin' brother!

2834
02:47:35,865 --> 02:47:39,365
- You fuckin' scumbags!
No more!

2835
02:47:42,875 --> 02:47:46,044
- Frankie!
- No more! You see? Watch!

2836
02:47:49,794 --> 02:47:53,634
- Frankie! Frankie! You piece of shit!
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!

2837
02:47:53,714 --> 02:47:56,963
Fuckin' punk,
motherfucker! Piece of shit!

2838
02:48:00,473 --> 02:48:02,893
No, no, no, no!

2839
02:48:03,013 --> 02:48:05,053
Take this motherfucker out!

2840
02:48:12,562 --> 02:48:14,902
Frankie, leave the kid alone.
He's still breathing.

2841
02:48:15,022 --> 02:48:18,401
He's still breathing.
Leave him alone. Frankie.

2842
02:48:19,901 --> 02:48:25,371
All right. Strip him.

2843
02:48:25,411 --> 02:48:29,580
No balls.
You got no fuckin' balls.

2844
02:48:29,700 --> 02:48:33,750
Ah, Dominick. Ah, Dom.

2845
02:48:38,340 --> 02:48:41,009
Dominick. Dominick.

2846
02:48:41,089 --> 02:48:44,889
Dominick.

2847
02:48:46,299 --> 02:48:48,219
Oh, Dominick.

2848
02:49:03,987 --> 02:49:08,237
Come on, come on.

2849
02:49:08,277 --> 02:49:10,237
- Bury them?
- Bury them.

2850
02:49:13,457 --> 02:49:15,366
The word was out.

2851
02:49:15,456 --> 02:49:17,376
The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.

2852
02:49:17,456 --> 02:49:23,046
How much were they gonna take? So they
made an example of him and his brother.

2853
02:49:23,126 --> 02:49:26,755
- They buried them
while they were still breathing.

2854
02:49:43,434 --> 02:49:45,854
Mister, you all right?
Watch out!

2855
02:49:50,113 --> 02:49:52,993
- Mister, you all right?
- Yeah.

2856
02:49:55,203 --> 02:49:58,953
They had other ideas for me.

2857
02:50:06,712 --> 02:50:08,672
We need some help over here!

2858
02:50:08,712 --> 02:50:12,171
You sure are lucky, mister.

2859
02:50:30,940 --> 02:50:33,980
The town will never be the same.

2860
02:50:34,070 --> 02:50:38,029
After the Tangiers,
the big corporations took it all over.

2861
02:50:38,109 --> 02:50:40,779
Today it looks like Disneyland.

2862
02:50:47,998 --> 02:50:50,038
And while the kids
play cardboard pirates...

2863
02:50:50,078 --> 02:50:53,418
Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments
and Junior's college money...

2864
02:50:53,498 --> 02:50:56,258
on the poker slots.

2865
02:50:59,257 --> 02:51:03,387
In the old days, dealers knew your name,
what you drank, what you played.

2866
02:51:03,427 --> 02:51:05,517
Today, it's like checkin'
into an airport.

2867
02:51:05,557 --> 02:51:08,846
And if you order room service,
you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.

2868
02:51:08,936 --> 02:51:13,066
Today it's all gone. You got a whale
show up with four million in a suitcase...

2869
02:51:13,106 --> 02:51:18,196
and some 25-year-old hotel school kid is
gonna want his social security number.

2870
02:51:20,065 --> 02:51:22,615
After the Teamsters
got knocked out of the box...

2871
02:51:22,695 --> 02:51:26,075
the corporations tore down practically
every one of the old casinos.

2872
02:51:26,115 --> 02:51:30,535
And where did the money come
from to rebuild the Pyramids?

2873
02:51:30,615 --> 02:51:33,584
Junk bonds.

2874
02:51:37,584 --> 02:51:39,794
Still not sure?

2875
02:51:39,874 --> 02:51:41,794
Probable. Maybe questionable.

2876
02:51:41,884 --> 02:51:44,173
Let me know as soon
as you can find out.

2877
02:51:44,253 --> 02:51:48,763
But in the end, I wound up
right back where I started.

2878
02:51:48,803 --> 02:51:50,763
I could still pick winners...

2879
02:51:50,843 --> 02:51:54,142
and I could still make money
for all kinds of people back home.

2880
02:51:54,222 --> 02:51:57,182
And why mess up a good thing?

2881
02:51:57,272 --> 02:51:59,182
And that's that.

2882
02:54:34,788 --> 02:54:37,958
# Sometimes I wonder why
I spend the lonely nights #

2883
02:54:41,748 --> 02:54:45,967
# Dreaming of a song #

2884
02:54:46,047 --> 02:54:50,507
# The melody
haunts my memory #

2885
02:54:54,057 --> 02:54:57,646
# And I am once again with you #

2886
02:55:00,766 --> 02:55:04,356
# When our love was new #

2887
02:55:04,436 --> 02:55:08,275
# And each kiss an inspiration #

2888
02:55:10,195 --> 02:55:14,155
# Ah, but that was long ago #

2889
02:55:14,235 --> 02:55:16,785
# And now my consolation #

2890
02:55:16,825 --> 02:55:19,824
# Is in the stardust of a song #

2891
02:55:23,454 --> 02:55:26,004
# Beside a garden wall #

2892
02:55:26,084 --> 02:55:28,624
# When stars were bright #

2893
02:55:28,674 --> 02:55:30,673
# And you were in my arms #

2894
02:55:33,173 --> 02:55:36,843
# The nightingale
told his fairy tale #

2895
02:55:41,353 --> 02:55:43,682
# Of paradise #

2896
02:55:43,722 --> 02:55:46,682
# Where roses grew #

2897
02:55:50,482 --> 02:55:53,071
# Though I dream in vain #

2898
02:55:56,781 --> 02:55:59,321
# In my heart #

2899
02:55:59,361 --> 02:56:01,661
# It will remain #

2900
02:56:03,531 --> 02:56:06,870
# My stardust melody #

2901
02:56:06,910 --> 02:56:09,920
# The memory #

2902
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:13,670
# Of love's refrain ##
