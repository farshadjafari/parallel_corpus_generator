1
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,219
They called it
the car for Everyman.

2
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:35,829
Henry Ford himself
called it a car
for the "great multitude."

3
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,540
lt was functional and simple,
like your sewing machine
or your cast-iron stove.

4
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,040
You could learn to drive it
in less than a day,

5
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:52,611
and you could get
any color you wanted,
so long as it was black.

6
00:01:55,522 --> 00:02:00,362
When Ford first conceived
the Model T, it took
13 hours to assemble.

7
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:06,422
Within five years,
he was turning out
a vehicle every 90 seconds.

8
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:12,062
Of course, the real invention
wasn't the car,

9
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:14,503
it was the assembly line
that built it.

10
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:20,413
Pretty soon, other businesses
had borrowed
the same techniques.

11
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:24,273
Seamstresses
became button sewers.

12
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:27,323
Furniture makers
became knob turners.

13
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:32,025
lt was the beginning
and the end of imagination

14
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:34,424
all at the same time.

15
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:47,805
Howard.

16
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,216
Charles, l'm talking to you.

17
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:57,986
They need spokes,
same as the others.
l know. They ought to
make a better spoke.

18
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:00,517
Yeah?
Then what would you do?

19
00:04:27,055 --> 00:04:29,255
lt was a land
of opportunity.

20
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:35,255
The country was shrinking,
and there was life
to be made out west

21
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:37,896
for any man
with drive and ambition.

22
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:43,406
lf your dream was big enough
and you had the guts
to follow it,

23
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:46,095
there was truly
a fortune to be made.

24
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:58,176
Good day, sir.

25
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:47,971
Damn thing blew on me.
What?

26
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:51,512
lt's a Stanley Steamer.
The boiler blew.

27
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:53,441
Oh?
Can you fix it?

28
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:03,853
Sure. Sure, l can fix it.

29
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,156
This is
an amazing machine.

30
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:46,356
lt's got a two-stroke
boiler system that's heated
by this huge fire grade.

31
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:50,336
l mean, it's...
Well, it's basically
a very small locomotive.

32
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:54,407
Thank you.
Now, l made
some improvements.

33
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:56,877
lt wasn't your boiler
that was blowing,
it was your bleed valve.

34
00:06:56,948 --> 00:06:58,077
So, with
the increased pressure,

35
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:01,018
l can see you getting
up to 40 miles an hour.

36
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,517
Really?
Oh, yeah.

37
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,078
And if you superheat
the excess,
l can see you reaching...

38
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:08,498
Fifty, maybe sixty miles
an hour.
ls that right?

39
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:12,628
Easily. And the thing
of it is, Mr. Coughlin,
you don't feed it,

40
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,229
you don't stable it,
and unless
you hit a lamppost,

41
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,929
the thing's not gonna
get sick and die on you.

42
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,110
That's funny.
To tell you the truth,

43
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,809
l wouldn't spend more than $5
on the best horse in America.

44
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:12,424
This is not
the finish line, my friends.
This is the start of the race.

45
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:14,525
The future is the finish line!

46
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:17,833
And the new Buick White Streak
is just the car
to take us there!

47
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:18,925
Yeah.

48
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:22,135
Four in-line cylinders,
42 and a half horsepower.

49
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:23,404
Wonderful.

50
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:25,175
And this is the very same car
that you can buy

51
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:27,736
at any one
of our five showrooms
all across the Bay Area.

52
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:33,206
"The age of the automobile
is here," boasted Howard.
"The future has arrived."

53
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:40,997
Oh, my.
Read the part about
the future again.

54
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,867
l'm kind of dealing
with it right now.

55
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:46,528
Oh, sorry.
Here. l'll take him.
Come here, big guy.

56
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:49,936
Come here. Come here.
Are you the future, huh?

57
00:08:50,477 --> 00:08:51,937
Are you the future?

58
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,937
Are you gonna...

59
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,777
Are you going to the moon?

60
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:01,208
The moon!

61
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:03,949
l'll take it.

62
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,948
Do we really need
all this?

63
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:09,658
Well, no. We don't need it...

64
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:14,319
There's also a caretaker's
house, a paddock, a barn,
some very nice stables.

65
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,729
How big are the stables?

66
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:51,933
Got it.

67
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:55,612
Settle down. Settle down.

68
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:59,633
Quit. Quit. Whoa. Whoa.

69
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,483
Whoa.

70
00:10:04,024 --> 00:10:05,113
Whoa.

71
00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:34,236
Come on, Dad.

72
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:38,946
Whoa.

73
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:51,167
There you go.

74
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,349
You're not
getting him a horse.
Why not? He's great at it.

75
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:09,049
Because he's 16 years old.
So?

76
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,789
So, he should earn it.

77
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:16,760
All right.

78
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,630
Tennyson!
Emerson!

79
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:20,191
Longfellow!

80
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:22,461
Everybody knows Tennyson.
All right. Quiet.

81
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,870
Nobody knows
Longfellow.
Yes, they do.

82
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:26,331
Dickinson.

83
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:32,171
"We never know
how high we are..."

84
00:11:34,282 --> 00:11:36,552
Oh, l know that.
Yeah. l know.

85
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:38,552
l know it.

86
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,752
Well?

87
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:46,322
"We never know how high we are
Till we are called to rise"

88
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:48,393
Good.
Very good, John.

89
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:52,792
"And then,
if we are true to plan
Our statures touch the skies"

90
00:11:52,873 --> 00:11:54,103
Excellent.
Yes!

91
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:55,664
That's really good.

92
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:00,973
Uh-oh.

93
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:06,714
"The heroism..."
Right.

94
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:09,113
Right. "The heroism..."

95
00:12:09,624 --> 00:12:12,054
"The heroism we recite

96
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:16,084
"Would be a daily thing"

97
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:20,526
That's it.
"Did not ourselves
the cubits warp

98
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:25,005
"For fear to be a king"

99
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:34,046
You should be riding it.
You knew the poem.

100
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:35,848
Yeah.

101
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:39,547
But he looks so perfect
out there, doesn't he?

102
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:42,187
Yeah. He does.

103
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:46,317
That's the poetry
right there, Agnes.

104
00:12:46,928 --> 00:12:48,588
That's the poetry.

105
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:52,768
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

106
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:56,299
l came here 15 years ago
with 21 cents in my pocket.

107
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,209
l know a lot of us
at the table
have a story like that.

108
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,610
And, you know,
l can't help thinking
that if we can start out there

109
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,980
and end up here,
where can't we go in America?

110
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,220
So, as corny as it sounds,
l'd like to propose
a toast to the future.

111
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,820
Because out here, my friends,
the sky is literally
the limit.

112
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,091
To the future!
To the future!

113
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:23,831
To the future!

114
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:50,552
There were no suicides
on Wall Street that day.

115
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,194
lt was a myth
that would grow over time.

116
00:13:57,744 --> 00:14:02,374
The real effect of
October 29th took
a little longer to sink in.

117
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:10,204
By noon, all the gains
of the previous year
had been obliterated.

118
00:14:11,826 --> 00:14:16,316
By 4:00 p.m.,
nearly $10 billion
of market value was gone.

119
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:22,896
Over the next two weeks,
the hemorrhage continued.

120
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:29,776
And before long,
25% of the workforce
was unemployed.

121
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,647
A great national
migration began.

122
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:44,348
Displaced families
took to the American highway

123
00:14:44,428 --> 00:14:47,358
in the last possession
that remained to them,

124
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:49,458
their automobile.

125
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:55,638
And all at once,
millions of Americans

126
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:59,259
had a new definition of home.

127
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:26,691
l made $2 today.

128
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:30,301
What?

129
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:32,363
l made $2.

130
00:15:33,273 --> 00:15:34,373
Here.

131
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:41,723
Where did you get these?

132
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:48,623
Yeah, your boy
combed them out,
changed all the tack.

133
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:50,393
l didn't have to
tell him a thing.

134
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:56,034
Hey, Red.
Attaboy!

135
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:59,365
Where'd a young fellow
like you learn so much
about horses?

136
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:01,104
His name's Johnny.

137
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,135
You can call me Red.

138
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:18,016
Yeah!

139
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:20,616
Yeah!

140
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,820
What's wrong?

141
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,139
What's wrong?

142
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,810
What's that?
Everything.

143
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,141
Dickens, Wordsworth.

144
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:16,721
There's your Arabian Nights
and Moby Dick, even your
Milne, from when you were...

145
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,621
Why? What's wrong?

146
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:22,791
Mr. Blodget here,
he has a house...
Dad.

147
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:24,261
...a real house.
Dad, what's wrong?

148
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:26,962
And his wife cooks.
She is a good cook.

149
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:29,472
No. No. Dad.
There's even a phone
next door.

150
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,803
We'll call you.
Every couple of weeks,
we'll call you,

151
00:17:31,873 --> 00:17:35,102
and we'll tell you
where we are.
No. We're just gonna
go home, all right?

152
00:17:35,173 --> 00:17:36,703
Let's go.
Listen to me.

153
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:39,873
You have a gift.
You have a gift.

154
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:42,983
Don't... Don't do this.

155
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:48,383
Dad, don't do this.
We'll be back.

156
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:01,795
Go on. Go with Mr. Blodget.
No.

157
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:03,706
He's gonna take care
of you, sweetie.

158
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:06,135
Mom, don't... Don't do this.
lt's okay. Go with him.

159
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:34,067
l don't know. You still look
pretty tall to be a jockey.

160
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:36,898
l've never been over 115.

161
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,438
Where'd you learn
to ride like that?
Home.

162
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,479
All right.
Here's the way it works.

163
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,219
l pay you $10 a week to ride.
You owe $9 for your meals,

164
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,919
$6 to sleep in the stalls,
$3 tack fee.
That's the deal.

165
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,220
How do l pay all that back?

166
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,729
You win.

167
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:07,640
You son of a bitch!
Get off of me!

168
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:34,263
Get off!

169
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:54,854
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

170
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:04,795
Get off of me!

171
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:13,336
A nose?

172
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:17,347
You lose a race a nose,
you'd better
fall off trying! Here!

173
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,886
Muck these stalls down,
every damn one of them!

174
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:23,977
A nose! For Christ's sake!

175
00:20:31,568 --> 00:20:34,438
No. No, Bill.
l'm not gonna do it.
No more layoffs.

176
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:37,839
Well, it can't get any worse.

177
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:41,739
Look, if it stays
like this, we'll just...

178
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,579
Bill, we'll be fine,
really. We will.

179
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,619
All right.
l'll see you in town.

180
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,760
Frankie, come on.
lt's a glorious day outside.

181
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:04,830
Why don't...
Why don't you go fishing
or something?

182
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:05,891
l'm reading.

183
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:08,001
You can read
when it's raining.

184
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:10,561
Come on. l'll teach you
to drive the truck.

185
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:13,371
You already taught me
to drive the truck.

186
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:17,882
Well, what are you reading?
Flash Gordon.

187
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:22,713
Come on, Dad.
lt's about the future!

188
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,653
We'll be in San Francisco
till Wednesday.

189
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:51,610
Yeah?

190
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,550
What?

191
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:11,971
No!

192
00:25:08,572 --> 00:25:09,732
Come inside.

193
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:12,302
l'm not done.

194
00:25:13,473 --> 00:25:15,063
Sam can do that.

195
00:25:16,612 --> 00:25:19,772
l don't want Sam to do it.
l want to do it.

196
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,583
Annie.
Don't... Don't... No!

197
00:25:32,494 --> 00:25:33,653
Ma'am.

198
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:26,508
Come on, Red! Come on!

199
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,919
Come on, kid.

200
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:22,944
At a time
when the world
really needed a drink,

201
00:27:23,314 --> 00:27:25,784
you couldn't get one
in the United States
of America.

202
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:30,924
Liquor was illegal.
Diversions were scarce,

203
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:34,514
and there's just so much
a human being can do without.

204
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:38,794
Soon, the border town
was born,

205
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:43,766
providing everything to
the south that their neighbor
to the north would not.

206
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:50,036
You could find anything:
food, companionship,

207
00:27:50,346 --> 00:27:54,606
decent gin,
and with gambling
outlawed as well,

208
00:27:56,347 --> 00:27:59,077
the chance to turn
bad luck into good.

209
00:28:04,928 --> 00:28:08,357
Relax! You got it!
You got it! You got it!

210
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:09,457
Go!

211
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:11,417
Damn it.

212
00:28:11,498 --> 00:28:14,097
That jockey was riding
like he's got an anvil
in his pocket.

213
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:17,108
l no bet with you no more.
l no like it.

214
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,709
Who's that?

215
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,309
George Woolf.
Greatest jockey in the world.

216
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,400
That's Charles Howard?
Yeah.

217
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:48,301
l thought he came
down here for a...
Quickie divorce?

218
00:28:48,371 --> 00:28:49,500
Why?

219
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,701
Look at him.

220
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:56,071
Nothing quick about that.

221
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:20,433
lt was in the palace
of the great Sultan.

222
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,434
Sultan of where?

223
00:29:22,944 --> 00:29:25,144
The Sultan of Araby.

224
00:29:25,785 --> 00:29:27,774
l'd been living there
for almost a year,

225
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:30,344
racing his Arabians
across the desert by day

226
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:33,985
and finishing
my personal history
of the region by night.

227
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:38,386
Then one day,
the Sultan summons me
into his throne room.

228
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:42,655
He looks at me and says,

229
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:44,065
"John Pollard..."
"John Pollard,

230
00:29:44,136 --> 00:29:48,966
"you are my greatest jockey.
lt is you l have chosen

231
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:53,607
"to ride my 100-mile race
from Kusma to Tripoli."

232
00:29:54,547 --> 00:29:55,806
200-mile.

233
00:29:57,077 --> 00:29:59,707
All right. 200-mile.
Excuse me, sahib.

234
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:04,417
You didn't need
to wreck it, Georgie.

235
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:07,518
When you
started telling that story,
it was only 50 miles.

236
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:10,557
Yeah, well,
everything gets longer
in the retelling.

237
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:12,598
Just ask your friend
Wanda over there.

238
00:30:13,699 --> 00:30:16,329
You know, if you start
riding a little more
and talking a little less,

239
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,998
you might start
winning some races.

240
00:30:18,069 --> 00:30:19,869
Well, l got two bucks
says l beat you in this one.

241
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,239
l'm not sure if you do,

242
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,940
but l got five
says l beat you.
Done.

243
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,649
Give me odds.
You're the favorite.
Even money.

244
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,620
Nah! Forget it! 2-to-1 !
All right. You got it.

245
00:30:35,691 --> 00:30:39,251
Hey, Johnny. You're on
a speed horse. What are you
doing back here with me?

246
00:30:39,331 --> 00:30:42,631
l like the conversation,
and it's not a speed horse.
Don't try to hook me.

247
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:44,961
You going tonight?
Nah. You?

248
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:47,591
Nah.
What time?

249
00:30:47,672 --> 00:30:50,541
l don't know. 8:00?
Okey-doke.

250
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:53,401
Oops, there's my hole!
Gotta go!

251
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:00,942
God damn it!

252
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:13,423
Whoa!

253
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:17,064
We got him!
All right.

254
00:31:17,134 --> 00:31:20,124
l'll take him.
Get the hell
out of here.

255
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:24,544
l said, l'll take him.
He's got a fractured foot.

256
00:31:25,245 --> 00:31:28,944
lf you're gonna
shoot him anyway,
l'll save you the bullet.

257
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:34,585
Whoa.
Fine.

258
00:31:34,886 --> 00:31:37,185
Let him go. Hey.
Let him have him.

259
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,067
Now, bud.

260
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,278
Hey, boy.

261
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:46,391
Okey-doke, Johnny.

262
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:49,402
There's my hole! Gotta fly!

263
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:55,533
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

264
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:05,043
"There once
was a princess from Siam

265
00:33:06,354 --> 00:33:09,724
"Who was sitting here
sort of like l am

266
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:12,894
"l wined her and dined her

267
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:16,264
"And then l reclined her..."

268
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,564
Shit.

269
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:24,595
What rhymes with Siam?

270
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:27,505
That's great.
You make that up?

271
00:33:28,276 --> 00:33:29,766
Pretty obvious, huh?

272
00:33:31,986 --> 00:33:35,716
That's beautiful.
No. You're beautiful.

273
00:33:36,957 --> 00:33:39,447
Don't say that. You pay me.

274
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:47,997
So, you wanna, you know,

275
00:33:48,837 --> 00:33:50,167
get going?

276
00:33:52,538 --> 00:33:54,028
Sure. Why not?

277
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:13,789
How do you miss
a hole like that?

278
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:16,449
There's my hole! Gotta fly!

279
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:18,589
Are you blind?

280
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:27,301
Angel, are you okay?

281
00:35:03,384 --> 00:35:04,713
You don't wanna watch?

282
00:35:08,884 --> 00:35:10,253
No. Not really.

283
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:13,444
l don't either.

284
00:35:23,036 --> 00:35:27,475
So, what? They brought you
down here to make you
feel better, is that it?

285
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:30,706
Yes. Sort of.

286
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:35,276
Those guys, they think
everything is fixed
with a party.

287
00:35:37,987 --> 00:35:40,887
l'm sorry. Who are you?

288
00:35:43,827 --> 00:35:45,557
Marcela Zabala.

289
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:52,158
My sister, lsabella,
she's married...
No. No, no. l know.

290
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:56,068
Nice to meet you. Charles.

291
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:11,849
So, do you feel better?

292
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,980
No.

293
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,360
No, not really.

294
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:24,731
No.

295
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:29,070
How could you?
Something like that.

296
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,004
Come on, buddy.
Wake up.

297
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:09,174
Come on.

298
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:23,326
Did l lose?
Oh, no. You clobbered him.

299
00:37:27,566 --> 00:37:28,666
Easy.

300
00:37:29,307 --> 00:37:32,466
Easy, easy.
Nice and slow.
l'm fine. l'm fine.

301
00:37:32,546 --> 00:37:34,776
Come on. Let me buy you
some turtle soup.
l'm fine, George.

302
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:35,936
Go win yourself
a race or something.

303
00:37:36,017 --> 00:37:38,677
Look, let's go down
to Sloan's, and we'll just...

304
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:43,407
l'm fine, George. l don't need
your help, and l sure as shit
don't need your charity.

305
00:37:45,688 --> 00:37:47,718
Leave me alone, all right?

306
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,998
lt's been 20 years
since l've been on a horse.

307
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,539
Don't worry.
lt's the kind of thing
that comes right back.

308
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:22,921
Let's go.

309
00:38:32,172 --> 00:38:33,161
Come on!

310
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:19,316
What? She got you
back up on a horse,
and now you wanna buy them?

311
00:39:19,396 --> 00:39:23,086
Yeah. Maybe.
Maybe a couple.
Well, you wanna win
or just own them?

312
00:39:24,526 --> 00:39:26,966
l wanna win.
What sort of question
is that?

313
00:39:27,037 --> 00:39:29,527
Well, you're gonna
need a trainer
before you buy horses.

314
00:39:29,607 --> 00:39:32,507
No. You need two.
So you can fire one.

315
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:41,037
Randy Thatcher's barn.
Trains about 50
or 60 ponies.

316
00:39:41,118 --> 00:39:44,277
Good fellow, too.
Real horse person.
A real horse-shitter.

317
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:48,788
You don't know. l don't know,
maybe you want a smaller barn,

318
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:51,558
somebody who can
take the time to...
Who's that?

319
00:39:54,899 --> 00:39:58,269
He's a crackpot.
Lives alone in the bushes.

320
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,339
What's he do?

321
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,369
l don't know. He used to be
a trainer, farrier. Now he
just looks after that horse.

322
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,899
Come on. Let's look
at another barn.

323
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:29,791
Howdy.

324
00:40:30,802 --> 00:40:32,031
Hello.

325
00:40:38,043 --> 00:40:40,483
You hungry?
No. No, thanks.

326
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:43,412
l'm fine. Charles Howard.

327
00:40:44,753 --> 00:40:47,272
Tom Smith.
Nice to meet you, Tom.

328
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,223
What's...
What's in his bandage?

329
00:40:55,435 --> 00:40:58,164
Oh, that's hawthorn root.

330
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:00,934
lt increases circulation.

331
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:02,935
You wanna sit down?

332
00:41:05,805 --> 00:41:07,795
All right. Thank you.

333
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,076
Will he get better?

334
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:17,386
Already is, a little.

335
00:41:19,086 --> 00:41:20,556
Will he race?

336
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:25,986
No. Not that one.

337
00:41:28,097 --> 00:41:30,128
So why are you
fixing him?

338
00:41:32,137 --> 00:41:33,606
'Cause l can.

339
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:39,337
Every horse is good
for something.

340
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:45,078
He could be a cart horse
or a lead pony.

341
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:47,548
And he's still nice
to look at.

342
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:52,459
You don't...
You don't throw
a whole life away

343
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:55,048
just 'cause
he's banged up a little.

344
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:10,400
ls that coffee?

345
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:12,801
Yeah.

346
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:19,812
lt's bad, though.

347
00:42:22,362 --> 00:42:24,382
You always tell the truth?

348
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:26,581
Yeah, l try to.

349
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,373
lt ain't just the speed.

350
00:42:45,914 --> 00:42:47,443
lt's the heart.

351
00:42:47,854 --> 00:42:50,944
And you want something
that's not afraid to compete.

352
00:42:51,584 --> 00:42:54,284
Half these horses
are just show ponies.

353
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:58,994
You want something
that's not gonna run
from a fight.

354
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:01,794
How do you find that?

355
00:43:03,305 --> 00:43:07,865
Look, l won the Robles
Handicap. l was second
in the Tijuana Derby.

356
00:43:07,936 --> 00:43:10,775
l won the Manzanita Oaks.
You know, that used
to be a stakes race.

357
00:43:10,846 --> 00:43:13,576
l know.
l would've won, T.J.,

358
00:43:13,646 --> 00:43:17,086
but the piece of shit
lugged out on me.
Sounds great.
We'll let you know.

359
00:43:17,547 --> 00:43:20,017
Look. l can work them out
in the morning.

360
00:43:21,717 --> 00:43:24,687
Or even hot-walk them
if you need me to.

361
00:43:25,327 --> 00:43:27,797
Really? You'll hot-walk them?

362
00:43:29,427 --> 00:43:31,327
This is something else.

363
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:35,067
A dream come true,
walking you around.

364
00:43:35,138 --> 00:43:39,198
Hook you up to a plow,
pull me around
for a little while. Come on.

365
00:43:40,338 --> 00:43:42,328
You ever run in the money?

366
00:43:43,479 --> 00:43:47,468
Hey. Hey.
You ever run in the money?
l don't think so.

367
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,279
Couldn't beat a human being,
let alone another horse.

368
00:43:52,919 --> 00:43:56,880
You goddamn sack-of-crap
old plater. Probably the
fastest you're gonna run

369
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,930
in your entire life,
you piece-of-shit
old glue-pot.

370
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,289
That's right.

371
00:44:21,622 --> 00:44:23,882
The first time
he saw Seabiscuit,

372
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,512
the colt was walking
through the fog
at 5:00 in the morning.

373
00:44:28,263 --> 00:44:32,163
Smith would say later
that the horse looked
right through him,

374
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:35,322
as if to say,
"What the hell
are you looking at?

375
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:37,663
"Who do you think you are?"

376
00:44:40,474 --> 00:44:43,703
He was a small horse,
barely 15 hands.

377
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:48,213
He was hurting, too.
There was a limp in his walk,

378
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:51,143
a wheezing when he breathed.

379
00:44:52,225 --> 00:44:54,715
Smith didn't pay
attention to that.

380
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:57,845
He was looking the horse
in the eye.

381
00:45:00,066 --> 00:45:02,465
God damn.

382
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:13,476
He was the son of Hard Tack,
sired by the mighty
Man o' War.

383
00:45:13,776 --> 00:45:17,716
But the breeding
did little to impress
anyone at Claiborne Farms.

384
00:45:17,777 --> 00:45:19,307
Get rid of him.

385
00:45:24,617 --> 00:45:27,247
At six months,
he was shipped off to train

386
00:45:27,327 --> 00:45:29,817
with the legendary trainer
"Sunny" Fitzsimmons,

387
00:45:29,898 --> 00:45:33,758
who, over time,
developed a similar opinion
of the colt.

388
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:36,689
ls that a racehorse
or a lead pony?

389
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:42,059
The judgment wasn't helped
by his gentle nature.

390
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:45,839
Where his sire
had been a fierce,
almost violent competitor,

391
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,469
Seabiscuit took to sleeping
for huge chunks of the day

392
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,850
and enjoyed lolling for hours
under the boughs
of the juniper trees.

393
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,189
His other great talent
was eating.

394
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,620
Though half the size
of other colts,

395
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,321
Seabiscuit could frequently
eat twice as much.

396
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:07,930
Fitzsimmons decided
the horse was lazy

397
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:11,461
and felt sure he could train
the obstinance out of him.

398
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:15,332
l want you to hit him
as many times as you can
over a quarter of a mile.

399
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:20,452
When he didn't improve,
they decided
the colt was incorrigible.

400
00:46:22,923 --> 00:46:25,652
They made him
a training partner
to better horses,

401
00:46:25,723 --> 00:46:28,053
forcing him to lose
head-to-head duels

402
00:46:28,124 --> 00:46:31,023
to boost the confidence
of the other animal.

403
00:46:31,764 --> 00:46:33,733
By the time
he was three years old,

404
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:37,593
Seabiscuit was struggling
in two cheap claiming
races a week.

405
00:46:38,564 --> 00:46:43,264
Soon he grew as bitter
and angry as his sire
Hard Tack had been.

406
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:49,145
He was sold
for the rock-bottom price
of $2,000.

407
00:46:52,586 --> 00:46:55,015
And, of course,
it all made sense.

408
00:46:56,156 --> 00:46:59,215
Champions were large,
they were sleek,

409
00:46:59,295 --> 00:47:01,585
they were
without imperfection.

410
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:07,256
When they finally did
race him, he did just what
they had trained him to do.

411
00:47:07,596 --> 00:47:09,036
He lost.

412
00:47:11,236 --> 00:47:13,396
What exactly is it
you like?

413
00:47:15,177 --> 00:47:18,146
He's got spirit.
l'll say.

414
00:47:20,278 --> 00:47:23,977
Can...
Can he be ridden?
Oh, sure.

415
00:47:27,918 --> 00:47:29,287
Eventually.

416
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:34,389
He can be a little touchy.
Yeah, l got it.

417
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:38,290
No. Really.
l'm fine.

418
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:50,570
Jesus Christ!
That horse is nuts!

419
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:11,132
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

420
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,662
Let's go! Come on,
you sons of bitches!

421
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:27,313
Let's go! Come on!

422
00:48:29,594 --> 00:48:31,884
Let's go! Come on,
you sons of bitches!

423
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:34,864
l'll take all of you!
Come on! Come on!

424
00:48:59,086 --> 00:49:00,455
lt's okay.

425
00:49:03,427 --> 00:49:05,296
l'm not afraid of you.

426
00:49:06,897 --> 00:49:09,697
Sure. l know.

427
00:49:11,737 --> 00:49:13,927
l know what you're all about.

428
00:49:21,848 --> 00:49:23,248
You hungry?

429
00:49:27,018 --> 00:49:28,008
Huh?

430
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,618
Yeah. Bet you are.

431
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:39,088
Come on. Come on, boy.

432
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:52,539
Yeah.

433
00:49:55,981 --> 00:49:58,971
Why don't you just
breeze him around
one turn.

434
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:01,280
Give the folks a look.
Great.

435
00:50:03,262 --> 00:50:07,281
Red Pollard,
Mr. and Mrs. Howard.
Yeah. Hi.

436
00:50:07,662 --> 00:50:08,852
Hello.

437
00:50:10,532 --> 00:50:12,792
Well, we'll just be
moving on.

438
00:50:18,273 --> 00:50:19,803
Does he breeze?

439
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,343
Well, we'll find out.

440
00:50:42,095 --> 00:50:46,035
Seems pretty fast.
Yeah. ln every direction.

441
00:50:48,205 --> 00:50:51,735
Hell, he's so beat-up,
it's hard to tell
what he's like.

442
00:50:52,276 --> 00:50:54,906
l just can't help
feeling they got him

443
00:50:55,176 --> 00:50:57,646
so screwed up
running in a circle,

444
00:50:58,086 --> 00:51:00,746
he's forgotten
what he was born to do.

445
00:51:02,316 --> 00:51:05,416
He just needs to learn
how to be a horse again.

446
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:09,117
Well, how do you do that?

447
00:51:17,638 --> 00:51:21,338
How far do you want
me to take him?
Till he stops.

448
00:51:23,108 --> 00:51:24,198
Okay.

449
00:51:25,879 --> 00:51:27,979
That seems like
a pretty good ride.

450
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:31,009
Hope so.

451
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:53,240
That's it, boy.
You're all right.

452
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:55,800
Let's see what you got, boy.

453
00:51:56,152 --> 00:51:57,912
Ha! Ha!

454
00:52:00,122 --> 00:52:02,852
That's it, boy. That's it!

455
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:10,722
Yeah!

456
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:38,084
Well, at least
he wasn't expensive.
No. That's true.

457
00:52:49,106 --> 00:52:52,195
God damn it!
You're an amazing animal!

458
00:53:19,298 --> 00:53:21,168
You can come inside,
you know.

459
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,269
l'm fine. Thank you.
Yeah, you look it.

460
00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:27,879
No, really, l'm fine.

461
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:31,979
Okay. Suit yourself.

462
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:45,830
Welcome.

463
00:54:00,252 --> 00:54:02,082
Thank you.
You're welcome.

464
00:54:13,933 --> 00:54:15,263
lt's okay.

465
00:54:17,233 --> 00:54:19,203
Oh, l'm not that hungry.

466
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,764
Sure you're not.

467
00:54:23,404 --> 00:54:25,064
lt's just a lot of food.

468
00:54:30,145 --> 00:54:31,514
lt's okay.

469
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:34,916
We rather have you
strong than thin.

470
00:54:58,777 --> 00:55:00,747
They called it "relief,"

471
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,248
but it was
a lot more than that.

472
00:55:03,747 --> 00:55:05,187
lt had dozens of names:

473
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:07,377
NRA, WPA,

474
00:55:07,918 --> 00:55:09,148
the CCC.

475
00:55:10,389 --> 00:55:13,158
But it really came down
to just one thing.

476
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,829
For the first time
in a long time,

477
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:19,619
someone cared.

478
00:55:21,439 --> 00:55:23,909
For the first time
in a long time,

479
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:26,598
you were no longer alone.

480
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:14,188
Goat racing?

481
00:57:14,259 --> 00:57:17,489
Oh, no. Just trying to
calm him down a little.

482
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:21,789
Smart ones hate
being alone all the time.
Oh.

483
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:26,200
And sometimes another animal,
it just soothes them a bit.

484
00:58:05,743 --> 00:58:07,613
Pretty quiet in there.

485
00:58:09,313 --> 00:58:12,013
What'd you do?
Go take a look.

486
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:46,686
Okay. You don't break him
or anything, but we gotta see
what he's got.

487
00:58:48,397 --> 00:58:52,057
You take him to
the five and a half pole
and turn him loose.

488
00:58:52,797 --> 00:58:57,067
Turn him loose?
Yeah, son.
He's a racehorse.

489
00:59:02,279 --> 00:59:03,368
Ha! Ha!

490
00:59:03,449 --> 00:59:04,708
Come on!

491
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:12,619
Come on!

492
00:59:14,589 --> 00:59:17,419
Come on! l know
you got more than this.
Let's show them, boy!

493
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,349
How's he look?

494
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,629
Asleep.

495
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,540
Come on! Let's show them,
Pops! Come on!

496
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:43,111
There it is! Yeah!

497
00:59:45,092 --> 00:59:46,282
Oh, my goodness.

498
00:59:57,773 --> 00:59:59,862
Yeah, you and me! Let's go!

499
01:00:13,824 --> 01:00:16,054
Boy. Fast?
Oh, yeah.

500
01:00:16,124 --> 01:00:17,384
How fast?

501
01:00:19,355 --> 01:00:22,814
Your horse just broke
the track record at Tanforan.

502
01:00:27,936 --> 01:00:32,396
Yep. Sometimes
they just hanker
for a little competition.

503
01:00:40,447 --> 01:00:43,786
As long as we're talking
long shots, l got a real
doozy for you, folks.

504
01:00:43,857 --> 01:00:45,847
Today we got a horse
that's going off at 70-to-1 ,

505
01:00:45,918 --> 01:00:47,757
and that's a short price,
my friends.

506
01:00:47,827 --> 01:00:51,287
This horse couldn't win
a church raffle, let alone
a $2,000 allowance.

507
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:54,887
Yeah, talk about a jump
in class. This is the skunk
at the garden party.

508
01:00:54,969 --> 01:00:56,958
Yes, he's the surprise
in the punch bowl.

509
01:00:57,038 --> 01:00:59,868
As a matter of fact,
l'll lay even money
that this nag, Seabiscuit,

510
01:00:59,938 --> 01:01:01,768
couldn't even finish
six furlongs.

511
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:05,239
This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin
live at Clockers' Corner.

512
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,509
Wow.
l wanted maroon.
They only had bright red.

513
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:14,780
Oh, it looks great.
You don't think
the "H" is too big?

514
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,080
You seen the size
of our jockey?

515
01:01:19,261 --> 01:01:20,490
Come on.

516
01:01:30,102 --> 01:01:33,202
Okay. The favorite's
that gray over there.

517
01:01:33,912 --> 01:01:36,271
He's got a big late charge,

518
01:01:36,342 --> 01:01:40,182
so lock in early with him
and stay right off his flank.

519
01:01:40,412 --> 01:01:41,471
Okay.

520
01:01:41,553 --> 01:01:45,712
And once our boy sees
who the competition is,
he'll do most of the work.

521
01:01:46,282 --> 01:01:48,782
But don't move
till that gray does.

522
01:01:49,092 --> 01:01:50,452
What if it's late?

523
01:01:51,623 --> 01:01:52,723
Let's go.

524
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:54,693
Twelve minutes to post.

525
01:01:55,633 --> 01:01:57,893
l don't think
it's gonna matter much.

526
01:01:59,034 --> 01:02:00,293
Honestly.

527
01:02:06,244 --> 01:02:08,904
Horses come out on the track
for the sixth race.

528
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,844
$20,000...

529
01:02:28,766 --> 01:02:32,366
Come on in.
Number 3,
Pollard on Seabiscuit.

530
01:02:33,237 --> 01:02:34,866
Followed by...

531
01:02:34,937 --> 01:02:39,067
Hey, sahib.
Kind of small, isn't he?

532
01:02:40,177 --> 01:02:42,277
Gonna look a lot smaller
in a second, Georgie.

533
01:02:42,348 --> 01:02:44,747
l got five bucks
says he doesn't.

534
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,478
Starter's poised.
The flag is up.

535
01:02:49,888 --> 01:02:51,827
And away they go.

536
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:56,919
Pirate's Gold breaks first,
followed by Geronimo
on the outside.

537
01:02:56,999 --> 01:03:00,088
Silver Treasure is third,
followed by Seabiscuit.

538
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:15,170
They're coming
by the five-furlong pole.

539
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:19,350
lt's Pirate's Gold, Geronimo,
Hill's Army and Agua Dulce.

540
01:03:26,092 --> 01:03:27,621
Son of a bitch!

541
01:03:28,161 --> 01:03:29,561
Ha! Ha!

542
01:03:31,871 --> 01:03:33,801
Piece of shit bastard!

543
01:03:36,242 --> 01:03:38,262
What the hell is he doing?

544
01:03:38,342 --> 01:03:41,042
...opening up
a three and a half...
A four-length lead.

545
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:43,342
Let's go!
What are you doing?

546
01:03:43,413 --> 01:03:46,472
l'm gonna
put you on the rail,
you piece of shit!

547
01:03:48,023 --> 01:03:50,282
Get off of me!
How do you like that,
you son of a bitch?

548
01:03:50,353 --> 01:03:51,513
You're gonna drop me, man!

549
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:57,013
The two horses
are flying down...
You like the rail?

550
01:04:03,064 --> 01:04:05,504
...as they come
into the homestretch.

551
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,405
Here comes the cavalry charge!

552
01:04:07,475 --> 01:04:09,164
Knock me
off my horse!

553
01:04:10,845 --> 01:04:14,614
lt's Silver Treasure
on the inside
followed by Pirate's Gold.

554
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:15,905
Again they go, Pirate's Gold.

555
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:18,745
Silver Treasure on the inside.
Silver Treasure
and Pirate's Gold.

556
01:04:18,816 --> 01:04:22,616
But at the wire it's
Silver Treasure, the winner
by two and a half lengths.

557
01:04:27,567 --> 01:04:28,726
Damn it.

558
01:04:28,797 --> 01:04:30,856
What the hell
were you thinking?
He fouled me.

559
01:04:30,937 --> 01:04:32,926
What am l supposed to do,
let him get away with that?

560
01:04:32,997 --> 01:04:35,557
Well, yeah,
when he's 40-to-1 .

561
01:04:35,637 --> 01:04:38,297
He almost put me in the rail!
Well, did he?

562
01:04:38,578 --> 01:04:41,637
Look, we had a plan.
He fouled me, Tom!

563
01:04:42,548 --> 01:04:44,708
What am l supposed to do?
He cut me off!

564
01:04:49,589 --> 01:04:51,058
He fouled me!

565
01:04:51,218 --> 01:04:52,918
Son? Son.

566
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:57,689
What are you so mad at?

567
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:11,110
There's even
a phone next door.
Dad.

568
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,110
We'll call you.
Every couple of weeks,
we'll call you,

569
01:05:13,181 --> 01:05:14,201
and we'll tell you
where we are.

570
01:05:14,281 --> 01:05:16,911
No. We're just gonna
go home, all right?

571
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:28,451
You have a gift.

572
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,222
You have a gift.

573
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,573
l need to borrow some money.

574
01:05:44,843 --> 01:05:46,142
All right.

575
01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:49,413
l haven't been
to a dentist, and...

576
01:05:51,724 --> 01:05:54,153
Well, l need to
borrow some money.

577
01:05:54,594 --> 01:05:57,924
That's fine.
l don't know
when l can pay you back.

578
01:05:58,925 --> 01:06:02,334
l mean, when we win.
When we win,
l can pay you back.

579
01:06:03,295 --> 01:06:05,734
That is, if you
still want me to ride.

580
01:06:07,805 --> 01:06:09,865
Of course l want you to ride.

581
01:06:13,646 --> 01:06:15,475
How much do you need?

582
01:06:19,746 --> 01:06:21,146
Ten dollars.

583
01:06:22,657 --> 01:06:23,776
Here.

584
01:06:30,967 --> 01:06:32,296
lt's fine.

585
01:06:38,238 --> 01:06:41,107
Thank you.
l really appreciate it.

586
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:53,149
That's it, Pops.
We're okay now.
lt's all right, boy.

587
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:58,419
Yeah, we're okay.
Nothing to worry about.

588
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,319
All the time in the world,
boy. That's it, Pops.

589
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,160
Nice and easy.
Just like that, boy.

590
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:07,860
Just like that.

591
01:07:10,411 --> 01:07:13,530
What do you think, boy?
You ready to go?

592
01:07:14,481 --> 01:07:17,041
You and me.
Let's go, boy. Let's go.

593
01:07:27,192 --> 01:07:28,552
Ha! Ha!

594
01:08:01,425 --> 01:08:03,724
ln the end,
it wasn't the dams

595
01:08:04,795 --> 01:08:08,135
or the roads
or the bridges or the parks.

596
01:08:09,805 --> 01:08:12,865
Or the tunnels
or the thousands of
other public projects

597
01:08:12,936 --> 01:08:14,936
that were built
in those years.

598
01:08:15,806 --> 01:08:18,176
lt was more invisible
than that.

599
01:08:19,616 --> 01:08:23,646
Men who were broken
only a year before
suddenly felt restored.

600
01:08:24,957 --> 01:08:28,087
Men who'd been shattered
suddenly found their voice.

601
01:08:28,157 --> 01:08:31,127
Well, l just think this horse
has a lot of heart.

602
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:33,187
He may have been down,
but he wasn't out.

603
01:08:33,258 --> 01:08:36,388
He may have lost a few,
but he didn't
let it get to him.

604
01:08:36,728 --> 01:08:39,258
l think we could all learn
a lick or two
from this little guy.

605
01:08:39,338 --> 01:08:41,268
Oh, and by the way,
he doesn't know he's little.

606
01:08:41,338 --> 01:08:43,868
He thinks he's the
biggest horse out there.

607
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:45,938
So you got big plans
for this little horse?

608
01:08:46,009 --> 01:08:48,909
Oh, yeah. See, sometimes
when the little guy,

609
01:08:48,979 --> 01:08:52,809
he doesn't know
he's a little guy,
he can do great big things.

610
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:54,479
Can we get a shot here?

611
01:08:54,549 --> 01:08:57,109
See, this isn't
the finish line.

612
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,659
The future is the finish line,

613
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,219
and the Biscuit
is just the horse
to get us there.

614
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:04,689
"Just
the horse to get us there."

615
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:07,760
You certainly made a believer
out of me, Mr. Howard.

616
01:09:07,831 --> 01:09:09,661
lt's time for this old tout
to eat some crow.

617
01:09:09,731 --> 01:09:14,231
Four and 20 blackbirds,
to be exact, all baked up
in some humble pie,

618
01:09:14,312 --> 01:09:16,501
and l'll take mine a la mode.

619
01:09:18,111 --> 01:09:21,141
Oh. And one more thing,
Mr. Howard.
l just wanna say...

620
01:09:21,212 --> 01:09:23,842
Thanks for the champagne.
Don't mention it.

621
01:09:23,982 --> 01:09:26,542
Did you see the infield?
No, not yet.

622
01:09:26,623 --> 01:09:30,453
Take a look. Your little horse
is selling out
the cheap seats.

623
01:09:40,033 --> 01:09:41,463
Oh, my gosh.

624
01:09:41,573 --> 01:09:44,873
Hey, what do you think
about all those folks
in the infield, Red?

625
01:09:44,944 --> 01:09:47,804
That's who we're riding for,
folks with a quarter
in their pocket.

626
01:09:47,874 --> 01:09:49,814
Red! Red! Red!
Red!

627
01:09:49,874 --> 01:09:53,004
That's an awful lot of hoopla
for such a little horse!

628
01:09:53,085 --> 01:09:55,645
"Though he be but little,
he is fierce."

629
01:09:55,714 --> 01:09:58,714
What's that? What?
That's Shakespeare, boys.

630
01:09:59,055 --> 01:10:02,255
That's Shakespeare.
Oh, Shakespeare.

631
01:10:17,507 --> 01:10:18,806
Holy cow.

632
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:25,537
Look at that, Biscuit.
Look at that.

633
01:10:25,687 --> 01:10:27,877
There you go. Oh, my God.

634
01:10:31,188 --> 01:10:34,958
There he is!
Seabiscuit! Yeah!

635
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:43,499
That's for you, Pops.
That's for you.

636
01:11:17,912 --> 01:11:19,742
That makes
six consecutive victories

637
01:11:19,812 --> 01:11:22,302
for this little colt
from nowhere,
one shy of the record.

638
01:11:22,382 --> 01:11:25,442
Why, he may be the biggest
sensation on four legs
since Hope and Crosby.

639
01:11:25,513 --> 01:11:29,312
Yes, it's standing room only
every time this pint-size pony
slips on a saddle,

640
01:11:29,383 --> 01:11:30,612
and if you can't afford
the quarter,

641
01:11:30,693 --> 01:11:32,652
a comfy tree limb
will catch you a glimpse.

642
01:11:32,723 --> 01:11:35,492
So what is the secret
of this rags-to-riches story?

643
01:11:35,563 --> 01:11:38,533
l have it on good authority
they feed Seabiscuit

644
01:11:38,593 --> 01:11:40,863
two pints of ice-cold beer
before every race.

645
01:11:41,564 --> 01:11:43,724
Reporting from trackside
in an equine exclusive...

646
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:44,963
Oh, my gosh!

647
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:46,864
This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin,
for Movietone News.

648
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:48,404
Who was that?

649
01:11:55,716 --> 01:11:56,945
Morning.

650
01:11:59,656 --> 01:12:03,815
Boy, what's this?
lt's beer.
From an admiring public.

651
01:12:04,526 --> 01:12:06,655
lt's pretty good, too.
There's more in there.

652
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:13,297
Where's the horse?
Signing autographs.

653
01:12:14,407 --> 01:12:15,627
He's what?

654
01:12:16,907 --> 01:12:18,096
Yeah.

655
01:12:18,178 --> 01:12:21,507
There you go, Max.
Let it dry for a minute
before you try to sell it.

656
01:12:21,578 --> 01:12:24,048
Hey, Charles.
You think you can
break the record?

657
01:12:24,118 --> 01:12:26,308
Oh, let's ask him.
Hey, Biscuit.

658
01:12:26,378 --> 01:12:29,247
You gonna win one more?
You gonna break the record?

659
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:33,148
Hey, Charles.
What do you think finally
turned this horse around?

660
01:12:33,219 --> 01:12:35,748
Well, l think we just
gave him a chance.

661
01:12:35,829 --> 01:12:38,559
Sometimes all somebody needs
is a second chance.

662
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:42,458
l think there are a lot
of people out there know
just what l'm talking about.

663
01:12:42,529 --> 01:12:44,299
You got that right.

664
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:48,330
Here, boys. Take some
horseshoes with you.

665
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:49,740
Right here, Charles.
Hey, thanks.

666
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:52,440
These are special.
Never run out of luck.

667
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:54,470
Yeah. Right.
There you go.

668
01:13:00,451 --> 01:13:03,681
Sam! Where the hell
are my horseshoes?

669
01:13:06,962 --> 01:13:09,391
You quit?
l can't work like this.

670
01:13:09,862 --> 01:13:12,762
He's not a parade animal.
He's a racehorse.

671
01:13:12,832 --> 01:13:15,802
Look, Tom, a little bit
of public relations...

672
01:13:15,872 --> 01:13:20,502
l can't get him to be
a great horse if l can't get
the time to work with him.

673
01:13:20,572 --> 01:13:23,632
What do you mean?
He is a great horse.
We don't know that yet.

674
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:26,613
He's won six stakes in a row.
Against who?

675
01:13:30,383 --> 01:13:33,514
This.
This is a great horse.

676
01:13:42,135 --> 01:13:44,965
First he smashed them
in the Kentucky Derby.

677
01:13:45,034 --> 01:13:47,334
Then he crushed them
in the Preakness.

678
01:13:48,575 --> 01:13:52,906
Then he destroyed all comers
in the Belmont
to snatch the Triple Crown.

679
01:13:53,446 --> 01:13:56,076
At almost 18 hands,
he's as big as he is fast.

680
01:13:56,146 --> 01:13:58,975
Eighteen hands?
They'd need two guys
to ride him.

681
01:13:59,346 --> 01:14:00,875
Yeah, he's big.

682
01:14:02,686 --> 01:14:06,586
Born of perfect breeding,
displaying perfect form,
boasting a perfect record,

683
01:14:06,657 --> 01:14:10,357
the millionaire Mr. Riddle
may have finally created
the perfect horse.

684
01:14:10,426 --> 01:14:14,416
Until next time,
this is Horace Halstedter
for Metrotone News.

685
01:14:16,068 --> 01:14:19,767
What the hell does that mean,
anyway? Perfect. He's perfect.

686
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:23,008
What the hell does
"perfect" mean?
What?

687
01:14:23,938 --> 01:14:28,378
You show me something
that's perfect, l'll show you
something that's not.

688
01:14:32,049 --> 01:14:34,178
Look, he's obviously
the best horse in the East.

689
01:14:34,259 --> 01:14:36,418
We're obviously
the best horse in the West.

690
01:14:36,489 --> 01:14:38,718
l just think the country
deserves to see
which horse is better.

691
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:43,259
You may not be able to see it,
folks, but the gauntlet just
landed on my desk.

692
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:45,130
Are we talking about
a match race, Mr. Howard?

693
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:49,470
Whatever Mr. Riddle wants.
Match race, stakes race,
potato sack race.

694
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,870
Just 'cause we're littler
doesn't mean we're scared.

695
01:14:52,941 --> 01:14:55,000
Right you are,
and out there in the
heartland of America,

696
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,770
every little guy knows
exactly what you mean.

697
01:14:56,841 --> 01:15:01,110
You hear that, Mr. Riddle?
You have an appointment
with destiny, a date with...

698
01:15:03,421 --> 01:15:05,550
Destiny.
Destiny. Yes, exactly.

699
01:15:05,621 --> 01:15:08,591
So, destiny,
and his name is Seabiscuit.

700
01:15:11,733 --> 01:15:13,062
Does Seabiscuit
stand a chance?

701
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:16,222
l'm glad they finally have
racing in California.

702
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:18,602
Do they use Western saddles
out there?

703
01:15:19,933 --> 01:15:22,733
Look. Comparing these
two horses is ridiculous.

704
01:15:23,243 --> 01:15:25,433
War Admiral
is a real racehorse

705
01:15:25,543 --> 01:15:28,133
who's won every prestigious
race in America.

706
01:15:28,283 --> 01:15:32,044
This little colt of theirs
is running out
on some cow track.

707
01:15:32,354 --> 01:15:33,754
You know.

708
01:15:33,814 --> 01:15:36,284
Yeah, if we responded
to every fledgling challenger

709
01:15:36,354 --> 01:15:38,753
who wants to make
a name for themselves,

710
01:15:39,395 --> 01:15:43,455
it wouldn't be fair to us.
But it wouldn't be fair
to them, either.

711
01:15:43,995 --> 01:15:47,395
You wouldn't put
Jack Dempsey in the ring
with a middleweight.

712
01:15:48,635 --> 01:15:49,965
Would you?

713
01:15:51,105 --> 01:15:53,975
"Middleweight"?
l'll kill him.

714
01:15:54,276 --> 01:15:56,636
l'll knock his
goddamn block off!
He's chicken!

715
01:15:56,707 --> 01:15:58,376
l know. l know.
"Middleweight"? l mean...

716
01:15:58,446 --> 01:16:01,435
We just have to
flush him out a little.
How?

717
01:16:02,087 --> 01:16:05,277
Well, this is still
America. Right?
Yeah.

718
01:16:06,387 --> 01:16:07,477
Cash.

719
01:16:08,727 --> 01:16:12,587
$100,000?
The biggest purse
in American history.

720
01:16:12,658 --> 01:16:13,687
l sure hope so.

721
01:16:13,758 --> 01:16:16,427
You'd get every top
Eastern thoroughbred.
All of them.

722
01:16:16,498 --> 01:16:18,868
You'd put this place
on the map.

723
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:24,438
They might have all that blue
blood crap. Our money is just
as good as theirs.

724
01:16:24,508 --> 01:16:27,028
Charlie...
Doc, this is our moment.

725
01:16:27,109 --> 01:16:30,409
Now, they're stuck
in the past.
This is the future.

726
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:31,678
Great.

727
01:16:33,219 --> 01:16:34,809
Come here.
What?

728
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:35,940
Come here.
What?

729
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:40,290
Come on. Don't you
wanna see them piling off
of those train cars,

730
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:44,059
coming out here to your track?

731
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:47,460
Huh? That's victory
in itself, Doc.

732
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:52,001
That's the finish line
right there.

733
01:16:54,141 --> 01:16:57,370
You sell cars like this?
Hundreds of them.

734
01:16:58,112 --> 01:16:59,541
Hold your horses!
Hold your horses!

735
01:16:59,611 --> 01:17:01,041
Just when you thought
you'd seen it all,

736
01:17:01,112 --> 01:17:02,942
Doc Strub has gone
and raided the cookie jar.

737
01:17:03,012 --> 01:17:06,042
Yes, he has smashed
the piggy bank and sold
the family silver.

738
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,981
$100,000 for one horse race?

739
01:17:08,052 --> 01:17:10,952
Makes me want to walk around
on all fours and throw
a saddle on my back.

740
01:17:11,023 --> 01:17:15,293
Will the Biscuit be the
favorite? Not likely, folks.
We're about to be invaded.

741
01:17:16,263 --> 01:17:19,793
We're talking Derby winners,
Preakness winners,
Belmont winners.

742
01:17:20,404 --> 01:17:22,803
Hold on, hold on.
l guess that's all one horse.

743
01:17:22,874 --> 01:17:26,274
But at 100,000 bucks,
how can the Admiral
not want to dock his ship

744
01:17:26,344 --> 01:17:27,863
in this friendly port?

745
01:17:27,944 --> 01:17:31,344
This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin
live from Clockers' Corner.

746
01:17:33,444 --> 01:17:35,614
They raised
the hundred grand!

747
01:17:35,755 --> 01:17:37,944
Yeah, how about that
Hundred Grander?

748
01:17:38,656 --> 01:17:40,015
No, thanks.

749
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:43,024
Excuse me, boys.

750
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:44,956
Shit!
Charles.

751
01:17:45,696 --> 01:17:48,125
Shit.
Yeah, l know what you mean.

752
01:17:48,536 --> 01:17:50,326
The hell with it.
We'll run him anyway.

753
01:17:50,396 --> 01:17:52,496
There are still gonna be
the greatest horses
in the world,

754
01:17:52,566 --> 01:17:55,697
and if we win this thing,
they're gonna have to face us.

755
01:17:55,836 --> 01:17:57,936
He's gonna have to face us.

756
01:18:06,647 --> 01:18:09,987
Okay. Special Agent's
pure speed.

757
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:12,988
He's gonna go to the lead,
but he can't handle
the distance.

758
01:18:13,058 --> 01:18:15,258
So don't get sucked in.
l won't.

759
01:18:15,329 --> 01:18:17,699
lndian Broom
could be there, too.

760
01:18:18,128 --> 01:18:21,969
We'll know
they're holding him back
if they use the ring bit.

761
01:18:22,099 --> 01:18:26,159
Now, the one to worry about
is Rosemont.

762
01:18:26,969 --> 01:18:29,269
He closes
like a freight train,

763
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:31,939
and he'll fight you
for it at the end.

764
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:36,180
You gotta have some momentum
built up by the time
he makes his move.

765
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:40,890
lt's still kind of soggy
out there from the other day,

766
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,690
so try to stay off the rail
where it's deep.

767
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:48,860
l figured l'd sit back
about three wide.
Yeah, that's fine.

768
01:18:50,761 --> 01:18:53,561
And other than that, just...

769
01:18:55,202 --> 01:18:56,971
Just try to feel it.

770
01:18:58,212 --> 01:19:00,542
He'll tell you
when he's ready.

771
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:34,300
Yeah, boy!

772
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,340
Red, come on, Red!

773
01:20:57,502 --> 01:20:59,732
Yeah, come on. Go! Go!

774
01:21:09,254 --> 01:21:10,914
Watch him, Red. Watch him.

775
01:21:16,224 --> 01:21:17,554
Come on! Come on!

776
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:29,364
lt's not my fault.
Not this time.

777
01:21:29,435 --> 01:21:32,035
l told you
look out for Rosemont.
l thought l had it.

778
01:21:32,106 --> 01:21:34,265
You stopped riding!
l couldn't see him!

779
01:21:34,345 --> 01:21:37,005
What the hell
are you talking about?
He was flying up your tail!

780
01:21:37,075 --> 01:21:39,305
Yeah, well, l can't...
What?

781
01:21:39,716 --> 01:21:41,236
See out there!

782
01:21:48,957 --> 01:21:50,826
He lied to us.
What?

783
01:21:51,227 --> 01:21:54,667
He lied to us.
You want a jockey
who lies to us?

784
01:21:54,997 --> 01:21:56,657
What do you mean?

785
01:21:57,197 --> 01:22:01,197
He can't see.
He's blind in one eye.

786
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:25,929
lt's fine, Tom.

787
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:31,539
lt's fine?
Yeah, it's fine.

788
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:40,171
You don't throw a whole life
away just 'cause it's
banged up a little bit.

789
01:22:43,921 --> 01:22:45,281
Good night.

790
01:22:49,562 --> 01:22:51,552
All right, all right.
Hold it.

791
01:22:51,662 --> 01:22:53,922
Well, l guess that little
horse of theirs
turned out to be

792
01:22:53,993 --> 01:22:55,762
a glorified claimer after all.

793
01:22:58,502 --> 01:23:02,202
At least we don't have to deal
with this David and Goliath
nonsense anymore.

794
01:23:02,273 --> 01:23:04,033
You can say that again.

795
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:06,532
All right, boys.
Let me through.

796
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:08,444
Wait a minute.
Mr. Riddle...

797
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:21,285
The hell with it.

798
01:23:24,025 --> 01:23:25,925
Just a couple
of announcements.

799
01:23:25,996 --> 01:23:30,405
First, Red Pollard will remain
Seabiscuit's jockey,

800
01:23:30,466 --> 01:23:31,956
now and forever.

801
01:23:32,176 --> 01:23:36,406
Second, if they're too scared
to come and race us,
we're gonna go find them.

802
01:23:36,476 --> 01:23:39,606
We're gonna enter every race
where War Admiral
is on the card,

803
01:23:39,676 --> 01:23:42,406
and if he scratches,
which he probably will,

804
01:23:42,486 --> 01:23:44,645
we'll enter the next race
he's on the card.

805
01:23:44,716 --> 01:23:48,716
And we won't come home
until we've faced him,
win, lose or draw.

806
01:23:49,887 --> 01:23:51,157
You know,

807
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:55,857
l'd rather have
one horse like this
than 100 War Admirals.

808
01:23:55,928 --> 01:23:57,557
Thanks, fellas.
Mr. Howard!

809
01:24:09,909 --> 01:24:12,208
Gotta see him!
Come on!

810
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:26,600
Look, l really don't know
what to say. We appreciate it.

811
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,600
l'm sure the Biscuit
appreciates it, too.

812
01:24:29,671 --> 01:24:32,570
He's just a little shy
about speaking in public.

813
01:24:34,201 --> 01:24:36,141
He'd thank you himself.

814
01:24:36,441 --> 01:24:40,171
l guess you all are here today

815
01:24:40,281 --> 01:24:43,471
because this is a horse
who won't give up.

816
01:24:43,581 --> 01:24:45,051
That's right.

817
01:24:45,152 --> 01:24:47,642
Even when life beats him
by a nose.

818
01:24:47,722 --> 01:24:50,212
That's right!
Yeah.
Ain't that the truth.

819
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:54,321
But, heck,
everybody loses a couple.

820
01:24:54,392 --> 01:24:56,452
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

821
01:24:57,163 --> 01:24:59,793
And you either pack up
and you go home,
or you keep fighting!

822
01:24:59,863 --> 01:25:01,563
lsn't that right?
Yeah!

823
01:25:01,903 --> 01:25:03,592
That's right!

824
01:25:03,673 --> 01:25:05,073
That's right.

825
01:25:05,743 --> 01:25:06,833
Now,

826
01:25:07,674 --> 01:25:10,404
do you want to see
a match race?
Yeah!

827
01:25:11,174 --> 01:25:13,514
You do?
Yeah!

828
01:25:13,584 --> 01:25:15,774
You wanna see this young fella
ride that horse?

829
01:25:15,854 --> 01:25:17,714
Yeah!
Yes!

830
01:25:18,055 --> 01:25:19,414
Seabiscuit!

831
01:25:22,355 --> 01:25:24,954
Extra! Extra!
Biscuit on the warpath!

832
01:25:25,025 --> 01:25:28,395
Will there be a match race?
lt's all right here.

833
01:25:28,466 --> 01:25:30,956
Extra! Extra!
Biscuit on the warpath!

834
01:25:31,036 --> 01:25:32,836
l don't know
what they're so worried about.

835
01:25:32,906 --> 01:25:37,896
l mean, look at us.
Our horse is too small.
Our jockey's too big.

836
01:25:38,506 --> 01:25:41,666
Our trainer is too old.
Forgive me, Tom.

837
01:25:42,747 --> 01:25:45,717
And l'm too dumb
to know the difference!
Yeah, Charlie!

838
01:25:45,787 --> 01:25:48,347
You'd think
they'd want to race us
instead of running away!

839
01:25:48,417 --> 01:25:49,816
Yeah!

840
01:25:58,568 --> 01:26:01,997
Ladies and gentlemen,
l am staring at a swarm
of humanity,

841
01:26:02,068 --> 01:26:05,498
a sea of hungry faces
demanding the match
of a lifetime.

842
01:26:05,569 --> 01:26:08,468
They have come here tonight
in the cold, in the wind,

843
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:11,169
in the chill of a late
October night.

844
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,179
Let me just make my way
over to one of them

845
01:26:14,249 --> 01:26:15,509
so you can hear it
for yourself.

846
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:17,610
Excuse me. Excuse me.
l'm sorry. Excuse me.

847
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:18,979
Ma'am, ma'am, if l may.

848
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:22,020
What brings you
out here tonight with your
three small children

849
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:24,390
clamoring for a view
of this little horse?

850
01:26:24,461 --> 01:26:26,520
Because we want to see
a match race!

851
01:26:30,631 --> 01:26:32,431
l said, don't you think

852
01:26:32,501 --> 01:26:34,930
Mr. Riddle
owes this country a...

853
01:26:35,001 --> 01:26:37,300
Match race! Match race!
Match race!

854
01:26:41,572 --> 01:26:45,572
Match race! Match race!
Match race!

855
01:26:46,753 --> 01:26:48,683
Fine, but it's on my terms.

856
01:26:49,652 --> 01:26:50,782
Any terms you want.

857
01:26:50,853 --> 01:26:53,382
Mile and three sixteenths.
l won't accept anything else.

858
01:26:53,453 --> 01:26:56,453
All right.
Want a walk-up
start with a bell.

859
01:26:57,494 --> 01:26:59,553
We won't be using
any contraptions.

860
01:27:00,534 --> 01:27:02,024
You mean a starting gate?

861
01:27:04,204 --> 01:27:07,434
Fine.
And we run it here,
at our home track.

862
01:27:08,574 --> 01:27:10,434
That's not negotiable.

863
01:27:11,914 --> 01:27:14,204
Seems like a
nice enough place.

864
01:27:14,874 --> 01:27:18,114
Oh, l'm sure you'll find it
quite comfortable, Mr. Howard.

865
01:27:27,026 --> 01:27:28,616
Jesus Christ!

866
01:27:30,067 --> 01:27:31,797
l wanna be a horse.

867
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:34,496
Well, you're
almost big enough.

868
01:27:35,206 --> 01:27:36,895
That's very funny.

869
01:27:37,667 --> 01:27:40,107
lt doesn't even
smell like a barn.

870
01:27:40,807 --> 01:27:43,606
They probably
deodorize it every morning.

871
01:27:43,747 --> 01:27:45,606
Well,
they still crap.

872
01:27:49,418 --> 01:27:51,318
Well, they do. They do.

873
01:27:52,018 --> 01:27:53,887
Over here, pal.
Right over here!

874
01:27:53,958 --> 01:27:55,718
There you go!
This way. This way.

875
01:27:55,788 --> 01:27:57,558
Take a good shot of that.

876
01:27:57,629 --> 01:27:58,858
Biscuit, here...

877
01:27:58,929 --> 01:28:00,829
Whoa! What's that thing?

878
01:28:04,769 --> 01:28:06,739
They got us
in the servants' quarters.

879
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:10,239
ls that him?
No.

880
01:28:11,709 --> 01:28:13,199
Bit too small.

881
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:18,210
That's him.

882
01:28:20,821 --> 01:28:22,180
Oh, my God.

883
01:28:30,431 --> 01:28:33,991
Maybe he's the kind of horse
that just looks good
in the paddock.

884
01:28:39,473 --> 01:28:40,532
Wow.

885
01:28:43,943 --> 01:28:45,973
We gotta get to the lead.

886
01:28:46,583 --> 01:28:48,572
Biscuit never goes
to the lead.

887
01:28:48,653 --> 01:28:52,413
l know,
but we gotta teach him
to break first.

888
01:28:53,124 --> 01:28:55,353
lf that monster shakes loose,

889
01:28:56,093 --> 01:28:57,953
we'll never catch him.

890
01:28:59,364 --> 01:29:01,054
What, retrain him?

891
01:29:04,795 --> 01:29:06,464
We got two weeks.

892
01:29:15,175 --> 01:29:16,474
Excuse me.

893
01:29:19,986 --> 01:29:22,045
We'd like to buy your bell.

894
01:29:24,316 --> 01:29:27,656
He didn't tell me
you were coming.
Oh, probably
just an oversight.

895
01:29:27,726 --> 01:29:29,656
Do you want me
to turn on some lights
or something?

896
01:29:29,727 --> 01:29:30,717
No.
No.

897
01:29:30,797 --> 01:29:31,786
No?

898
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:35,697
Okay. lt's
a predatory response.

899
01:29:36,497 --> 01:29:39,767
lf l just brush it past
his flank, he'll bolt.

900
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:43,197
And we just want to teach him
to do it with the bell.

901
01:29:43,278 --> 01:29:46,607
How far do you want me
to take him?
To a hundred feet.

902
01:29:46,678 --> 01:29:49,838
Just so he learns
to break first.
Okay. Got it.

903
01:29:52,649 --> 01:29:54,349
You ready?
Ready.

904
01:30:18,611 --> 01:30:20,481
All right. Here we go.

905
01:30:38,502 --> 01:30:42,032
Oh, come on, Tom!
When you gonna work
that horse out?

906
01:30:44,143 --> 01:30:45,612
When he wakes up, l guess.

907
01:30:46,143 --> 01:30:47,542
Geez!

908
01:30:48,273 --> 01:30:50,473
For crying out loud.

909
01:30:52,314 --> 01:30:53,904
The whole track?

910
01:30:54,314 --> 01:30:58,013
l just want him to do it once
with nothing in front of him.

911
01:30:58,524 --> 01:31:02,584
Yeah, but l can't see
out there.
That's all right. He can.

912
01:31:03,164 --> 01:31:05,424
Come on, Tom. Tom, please.

913
01:31:05,495 --> 01:31:08,294
Why do you always
have to do this? Shit.

914
01:31:11,005 --> 01:31:12,295
Oh, great.

915
01:31:15,906 --> 01:31:17,566
Jesus Christ.

916
01:31:23,047 --> 01:31:24,147
Wow.

917
01:31:26,317 --> 01:31:27,686
Oh, my God.

918
01:31:40,298 --> 01:31:41,667
Tim.
Hey.

919
01:31:44,108 --> 01:31:48,169
Pumpkin. Hey.
How you doing, Pumpkin?

920
01:31:50,848 --> 01:31:52,278
Are you shy?

921
01:31:53,619 --> 01:31:54,878
Hey, Red?

922
01:31:58,419 --> 01:31:59,859
Oh, my gosh.

923
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:05,160
Yeah. Guess l should have
used you as a jockey
instead of a groom.

924
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:06,860
No, no. lt was...

925
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:09,120
That was great.

926
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:12,560
Look, l'm in a little trouble.

927
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:16,460
l got this horse over
in Annex, and l been trying
to sell a share of him.

928
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:17,970
Tough times and all?

929
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:21,241
l was wondering if maybe
you'd breeze him for me.

930
01:32:22,452 --> 01:32:27,212
lf folks saw Red Pollard...
Yeah. l'll breeze
your horse for you.

931
01:32:31,392 --> 01:32:32,512
lt's on.
Good.

932
01:32:32,592 --> 01:32:35,392
Just take him
for five furlongs
at around a minute one.

933
01:32:35,463 --> 01:32:37,452
Can he do that?
Should.

934
01:32:42,834 --> 01:32:44,203
Try it now.

935
01:32:54,085 --> 01:32:55,814
Okay, try it again.

936
01:33:02,095 --> 01:33:03,714
Easy! Easy! Easy!

937
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:03,049
Look, most of the damage
was restricted to his leg.

938
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:07,490
How bad is it?
God, l don't know.
lt's shattered.

939
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,950
Eleven, twelve breaks.
Something like that.

940
01:34:10,031 --> 01:34:12,191
We're gonna have to operate.

941
01:34:13,401 --> 01:34:15,271
Just sit tight for me.

942
01:34:56,915 --> 01:34:58,714
Well, we're all done.

943
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:03,215
He'll always limp,
but it looks like
he's gonna walk again.

944
01:35:05,085 --> 01:35:08,495
Will he ride?
No, he's not gonna ride.

945
01:35:08,796 --> 01:35:12,166
You're sure?
He won't ride.
But he's gonna walk.

946
01:35:13,136 --> 01:35:16,036
You take care.
Thank you.

947
01:35:20,937 --> 01:35:22,037
Hey.

948
01:35:22,477 --> 01:35:24,706
You should see
the other guy.

949
01:35:25,347 --> 01:35:26,607
You're gonna be fine.

950
01:35:26,678 --> 01:35:30,277
Couple of months,
you're gonna be up
and around like new.

951
01:35:31,048 --> 01:35:34,107
l'm the one who makes up
the stories, remember?

952
01:35:36,058 --> 01:35:37,418
Well, yeah.

953
01:35:38,689 --> 01:35:41,059
Maybe a little
longer than that.

954
01:35:42,129 --> 01:35:43,258
Yeah.

955
01:35:45,469 --> 01:35:49,269
Look, l think we're gonna
have to scratch.

956
01:35:50,770 --> 01:35:53,169
No. No, don't scratch.

957
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:57,009
Son, he's a great horse,
but he can't run by himself.

958
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:58,570
Don't scratch.

959
01:36:06,091 --> 01:36:07,490
Call Woolf.

960
01:36:09,032 --> 01:36:11,551
Son, nobody's riding...
lt's okay.

961
01:36:12,962 --> 01:36:14,232
Call him.

962
01:36:15,131 --> 01:36:16,691
Are you gonna scratch?

963
01:36:16,772 --> 01:36:18,791
No, we're not gonna scratch.

964
01:36:18,872 --> 01:36:20,861
Red Pollard wants
Seabiscuit to win this race

965
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:22,462
more than anything
in the world.

966
01:36:22,542 --> 01:36:24,372
He wouldn't let us scratch.

967
01:36:25,243 --> 01:36:28,443
Thank you much.
l appreciate it.
You're welcome.

968
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:32,343
The lceman cometh!
What a pinch hitter.

969
01:36:32,424 --> 01:36:34,474
Why, it's like getting
Babe Ruth off the bench.

970
01:36:34,553 --> 01:36:38,082
Nerves of steel,
ice water in his veins.
Why, George Woolf is...

971
01:36:38,153 --> 01:36:39,522
lrrelevant.

972
01:36:39,593 --> 01:36:41,523
They can get
the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse

973
01:36:41,594 --> 01:36:44,194
as far as l'm concerned.
Won't make any difference.

974
01:36:44,265 --> 01:36:47,705
War Admiral
is a superior horse
with superior breeding.

975
01:36:47,764 --> 01:36:49,934
Doesn't matter
who the passenger is.

976
01:36:52,235 --> 01:36:54,405
He's got a strong
left lead, Georgie.

977
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:56,804
Banks like
a frigging airplane.

978
01:36:56,875 --> 01:36:58,475
But he might need help
switching to it,

979
01:36:58,546 --> 01:37:01,016
so ease him off the rail
just before the turn.

980
01:37:01,086 --> 01:37:03,776
Like you did
in the Gold Cup.
Exactly.

981
01:37:03,856 --> 01:37:06,446
He needs a good warm-up,
so take him out slow.

982
01:37:06,527 --> 01:37:09,287
When you do ask him,
don't use the whip.

983
01:37:09,426 --> 01:37:13,326
Just flick it twice,
show him it's there.
He'll know it's time.

984
01:37:13,567 --> 01:37:14,757
Right.

985
01:37:17,267 --> 01:37:19,397
And never on the left side.

986
01:37:20,008 --> 01:37:22,907
They hit him on the left side
when he was a baby.

987
01:37:23,238 --> 01:37:26,177
l wish it was you, Johnny.
Come on.

988
01:37:27,277 --> 01:37:29,507
l'll be right there with you.

989
01:37:38,089 --> 01:37:42,459
Great. Now, show him the stick
at the quarter pole,

990
01:37:43,429 --> 01:37:45,989
and he'll give you
a whole new gear.

991
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,600
Okay, now,

992
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:55,600
force him to that left lead
a little earlier,

993
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:58,410
and he'll give you even more.

994
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:02,370
Great.

995
01:38:02,451 --> 01:38:04,881
Now, shut the door.

996
01:38:21,503 --> 01:38:26,273
Okay. You know how Smith
wants you to fight for
the lead by the first turn?

997
01:38:26,874 --> 01:38:29,503
Well, yeah. We were
working with that bell.

998
01:38:30,213 --> 01:38:33,514
l was a little nervous
about that.
No, no, it's fine.

999
01:38:33,583 --> 01:38:36,313
But you gotta give it up
on the backstretch.

1000
01:38:36,384 --> 01:38:39,084
Give it up?
Give him back the lead.

1001
01:38:40,854 --> 01:38:42,884
He fights for it, Georgie.

1002
01:38:43,564 --> 01:38:46,464
lf you bring him head to head
with that other horse,

1003
01:38:46,535 --> 01:38:48,694
and he looks him in the eye,

1004
01:38:48,935 --> 01:38:51,405
there's no way
he loses that race.

1005
01:38:51,935 --> 01:38:54,735
You just hold him
through that final turn

1006
01:38:54,806 --> 01:38:57,675
and let him get a good look
at the Admiral.

1007
01:38:57,746 --> 01:38:59,365
Then let him go.

1008
01:39:00,716 --> 01:39:02,975
lt's not in his feet, Georgie.

1009
01:39:05,346 --> 01:39:06,946
lt's right here.

1010
01:39:12,387 --> 01:39:14,886
By 10:00 a.m.,
the closest place to park

1011
01:39:14,957 --> 01:39:16,727
was 15 blocks away.

1012
01:39:17,128 --> 01:39:20,258
The volume of refreshments
alone was staggering.

1013
01:39:20,668 --> 01:39:23,368
Seventeen thousand gallons
of lemonade.

1014
01:39:23,438 --> 01:39:25,428
Sixty thousand hot dogs.

1015
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:28,098
Two thousand kegs of beer.

1016
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:30,978
NBC broadcast the race,

1017
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:34,178
and businesses around America
scheduled a half day of work

1018
01:39:34,249 --> 01:39:36,479
so their employees
could hear the call,

1019
01:39:36,549 --> 01:39:40,749
thanks in part to a missive
fired by Mr. Howard
only the day before.

1020
01:39:40,819 --> 01:39:43,379
Look, l know this is
a fancy track and all,

1021
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:45,519
but l think they ought to
open up the infield,

1022
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:48,259
so normal folks
can come see the race.

1023
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:51,470
You shouldn't have to be rich
to enjoy something like this.

1024
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:55,640
Seabiscuit entered the race
a 2-to-1 underdog,

1025
01:39:55,701 --> 01:39:59,271
but you would never know it
from the growing noise
in the infield.

1026
01:39:59,341 --> 01:40:00,601
Get your program!

1027
01:40:00,681 --> 01:40:02,041
By the time it was over,

1028
01:40:02,111 --> 01:40:05,412
more than 48 million Americans
would hear the call.

1029
01:40:06,281 --> 01:40:10,451
Okay, it's still
kind of soggy at the rails,

1030
01:40:10,522 --> 01:40:13,222
so try to keep him
out of there.

1031
01:40:13,563 --> 01:40:17,323
There's a dry tractor tread
about five feet
out off the fence.

1032
01:40:17,392 --> 01:40:19,762
l walked the track
this morning.

1033
01:40:20,533 --> 01:40:22,052
Good. Good.

1034
01:40:22,903 --> 01:40:27,233
Now, he ought to break
just like we worked on.

1035
01:40:29,044 --> 01:40:31,673
But there's one more thing.

1036
01:40:32,984 --> 01:40:35,844
What? Let him catch me
on the backstretch?

1037
01:40:37,254 --> 01:40:40,224
You're not the only one
who knows this horse.

1038
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:45,615
Safe trip, George.

1039
01:40:45,725 --> 01:40:48,054
And a short one.
Let's go, Sam.

1040
01:40:53,736 --> 01:40:56,166
Good luck, George.
Thanks, Nick.

1041
01:40:56,736 --> 01:40:58,466
Charley!
George.

1042
01:40:59,206 --> 01:41:01,435
The two jockeys have
acknowledged each other.

1043
01:41:01,506 --> 01:41:04,606
lt's a quick hello,
like boxers touching gloves.

1044
01:41:04,677 --> 01:41:07,207
Come on, George.
This is no time
for small talk.

1045
01:41:07,287 --> 01:41:11,047
Both the horses are now on
the main track, and you can
hear the roar from the crowd.

1046
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:37,450
There he is!

1047
01:42:44,725 --> 01:42:47,525
lt's Seabiscuit by a nose,
now by a head.

1048
01:42:47,796 --> 01:42:51,356
He's leading War Admiral,
pressing on him a neck behind.

1049
01:42:52,696 --> 01:42:56,565
They fly
toward the clubhouse turn.
Who will be into it first?

1050
01:42:57,566 --> 01:43:01,696
lt's Seabiscuit heading
the turn first and driving
for the backstretch!

1051
01:43:09,718 --> 01:43:12,848
Now, coming out of the bend,
it's Seabiscuit

1052
01:43:12,918 --> 01:43:15,047
with a two-length lead
coming into the backstretch.

1053
01:43:15,118 --> 01:43:16,818
lt's Seabiscuit by two.

1054
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:34,909
Now, back him off, son.
Back him off. Back him off.

1055
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:40,680
Come on back, George.
Come on, come on, come on.

1056
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:44,580
Now on
the backstretch, Seabiscuit
still with a two-length lead.

1057
01:43:44,651 --> 01:43:47,021
Come on, Georgie.
Don't fool around.

1058
01:43:49,061 --> 01:43:51,891
l sure hope you're right,
Red. Here we go.

1059
01:43:52,531 --> 01:43:54,261
Easy, Pops.

1060
01:44:00,542 --> 01:44:02,331
God damn it, Johnny.

1061
01:44:12,653 --> 01:44:16,053
lt's now War Admiral!
lt's War Admiral!

1062
01:44:16,124 --> 01:44:17,684
lt's Seabiscuit
and War Admiral,

1063
01:44:17,754 --> 01:44:20,784
neck and neck
as they go into
the homestretch!

1064
01:44:27,334 --> 01:44:30,234
Close, Pops. Easy, Pops.

1065
01:44:31,705 --> 01:44:33,034
That's it.

1066
01:44:35,005 --> 01:44:35,995
Come on.

1067
01:44:40,146 --> 01:44:43,675
lt's Seabiscuit.
Now War Admiral! Now
Seabiscuit! Now War Admiral!

1068
01:44:43,756 --> 01:44:45,545
Not going now, Pops.

1069
01:44:46,686 --> 01:44:48,845
Now Seabiscuit!
Now War Admiral!

1070
01:45:01,267 --> 01:45:02,466
Do it.

1071
01:45:03,238 --> 01:45:05,007
Do it now. Come on, George!

1072
01:45:05,078 --> 01:45:06,867
Turn him loose.
Turn him loose.

1073
01:45:06,948 --> 01:45:08,168
Do it now, George!

1074
01:45:10,318 --> 01:45:11,978
So long, Charley!

1075
01:45:15,249 --> 01:45:16,408
Turn him loose!

1076
01:45:16,488 --> 01:45:19,008
Here comes Seabiscuit!

1077
01:45:24,059 --> 01:45:26,189
lt's Seabiscuit by a length!

1078
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:31,730
Come on, Biscuit!

1079
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:40,600
Seabiscuit!

1080
01:45:47,121 --> 01:45:50,151
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1081
01:46:53,997 --> 01:46:55,587
Congratulations.

1082
01:46:55,927 --> 01:46:57,127
Amazing.
Congratulations.

1083
01:46:57,197 --> 01:46:58,497
Thank you.

1084
01:46:58,568 --> 01:47:00,927
lceman, you did it.
How does it feel?

1085
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:04,558
Well, l just wish my good
friend Red Pollard was
up here today instead of me.

1086
01:47:04,638 --> 01:47:05,728
He will be.

1087
01:47:10,448 --> 01:47:14,308
This concludes
our radio broadcast
of the race of the century.

1088
01:47:15,018 --> 01:47:18,419
Now a word from our sponsor,
the American Oil Company.

1089
01:47:18,490 --> 01:47:21,180
Money can't buy
a finer motor oil...

1090
01:47:40,111 --> 01:47:41,601
Easy does it.

1091
01:47:42,241 --> 01:47:44,801
Watch it.
Watch those wheels.

1092
01:48:38,876 --> 01:48:40,466
All hail
the conquering hero.

1093
01:48:40,547 --> 01:48:42,636
Yes, folks, he's back.
The little engine that could.

1094
01:48:42,706 --> 01:48:44,375
No more match races
for this little pony,

1095
01:48:44,446 --> 01:48:46,466
because, quite frankly,
they're all out of matches.

1096
01:48:46,546 --> 01:48:50,146
Who's he gonna race? Pegasus?
l pity these other horses.

1097
01:50:46,007 --> 01:50:48,347
When will they know?
l don't know.

1098
01:50:48,617 --> 01:50:52,077
Maybe an hour. l'm not sure.
Charles is with the vet
right now.

1099
01:50:54,257 --> 01:50:57,347
Does it hurt when he bends it?
'Cause if it doesn't hurt
when he bends it...

1100
01:50:57,428 --> 01:51:00,448
We don't know anything yet.
l'll call you
as soon as we do.

1101
01:51:00,528 --> 01:51:02,387
l promise.
All right.

1102
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:11,770
He was running easy on me.
There was no warning.

1103
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,029
He's gotta be all right.

1104
01:51:13,110 --> 01:51:15,469
He's gotta be all right.
l know.

1105
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:18,140
Mr. Howard.

1106
01:51:26,491 --> 01:51:29,151
Well, he ruptured
a whole ligament.

1107
01:51:29,521 --> 01:51:33,020
l put a splint on him
just to keep him immobilized,

1108
01:51:33,091 --> 01:51:35,461
but right now
he's totally lame.

1109
01:51:36,972 --> 01:51:38,562
He's not gonna race again.

1110
01:51:43,472 --> 01:51:44,702
Look,

1111
01:51:46,742 --> 01:51:48,712
l know this is hard,

1112
01:51:48,783 --> 01:51:51,613
but l'll put him down for you
if you want me to.

1113
01:52:28,126 --> 01:52:30,856
Oh, that's okay, Pops.
l'll come to you.

1114
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:38,256
Hey.

1115
01:53:13,740 --> 01:53:16,829
See, first, you gotta get
a little flexibility.

1116
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:20,240
Yeah. Then you can
put weight on it.

1117
01:53:20,311 --> 01:53:24,581
Then once you start to put
weight on it,
the whole leg gets stronger.

1118
01:53:25,021 --> 01:53:27,851
l know. l know.
l'm in a hurry, too, Pops.

1119
01:53:28,351 --> 01:53:31,190
But you know what Hadrian said
about Rome.

1120
01:53:31,261 --> 01:53:33,491
"Brick by brick, my citizens.

1121
01:53:33,892 --> 01:53:35,522
"Brick by brick."

1122
01:53:37,262 --> 01:53:38,252
See,

1123
01:53:39,832 --> 01:53:41,772
they're Arabians,

1124
01:53:41,832 --> 01:53:44,002
so they don't need to drink.

1125
01:53:44,172 --> 01:53:47,572
These horses can go
five or six days

1126
01:53:48,443 --> 01:53:51,672
without a drop of water,
like a camel.

1127
01:53:53,244 --> 01:53:56,213
Oh, l'm not saying
that's what you should do.

1128
01:53:56,954 --> 01:53:59,513
l'm just saying
that's what they do.

1129
01:54:01,854 --> 01:54:04,024
Oh, good idea.

1130
01:54:05,525 --> 01:54:07,255
Take a little rest.

1131
01:54:45,638 --> 01:54:47,228
l don't know, Red.

1132
01:54:47,308 --> 01:54:49,778
We're just gonna
walk in a circle.

1133
01:54:50,478 --> 01:54:52,738
You think the leg
will hold you?

1134
01:54:52,808 --> 01:54:56,338
Horse weighs 1,200 pounds,
Sam. l'm an afterthought.

1135
01:54:56,418 --> 01:54:58,218
No, l mean your leg.

1136
01:55:05,059 --> 01:55:08,359
Here comes Seabiscuit
charging down the lane,

1137
01:55:08,699 --> 01:55:11,219
picking off competition
one by one.

1138
01:55:11,570 --> 01:55:13,969
He's third! Now second!

1139
01:55:14,371 --> 01:55:15,700
Now first!

1140
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:18,800
And it's Seabiscuit
at the wire

1141
01:55:18,871 --> 01:55:23,371
to win the Santa Anita
Handicap with Red Pollard
aboard! Yes!

1142
01:55:28,321 --> 01:55:29,441
Nice.

1143
01:55:43,803 --> 01:55:44,932
What?

1144
01:56:02,524 --> 01:56:04,213
Whoa, Pops. Easy.

1145
01:56:08,695 --> 01:56:09,924
Whoa.

1146
01:56:13,066 --> 01:56:14,325
Wow, Pops.

1147
01:56:14,436 --> 01:56:16,806
You feel better,
don't you, boy?

1148
01:56:22,446 --> 01:56:25,416
lt's okay, Sam.
l'm just gonna mow
the lawn a little bit.

1149
01:56:25,476 --> 01:56:27,176
Fine with me, Red.

1150
01:56:38,898 --> 01:56:41,388
Way to go! All right.

1151
01:56:49,739 --> 01:56:52,369
Looking good. Yeah,
you're great, Red!

1152
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:05,119
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Way to go, Red.

1153
01:57:35,552 --> 01:57:37,583
ls it even possible?
TOM: Sure.

1154
01:57:37,663 --> 01:57:39,593
Most folks don't
give it a chance.

1155
01:57:39,663 --> 01:57:41,352
Most folks just...

1156
01:57:43,093 --> 01:57:47,463
The best thing to do
is get him down there
and let him gallop a little.

1157
01:57:48,304 --> 01:57:50,504
l mean, that's the only way
we're really gonna know.

1158
01:57:50,574 --> 01:57:54,473
Can he handle that?
Sure. l mean, l think so.

1159
01:58:17,207 --> 01:58:19,566
He worked great.
l couldn't feel a thing.

1160
01:58:19,636 --> 01:58:22,965
Why don't we give him
a full work on Friday morning?

1161
01:58:23,807 --> 01:58:26,247
Maybe six furlongs.
See what we got.

1162
01:58:26,307 --> 01:58:28,207
Sure. l'll be here.

1163
01:58:28,647 --> 01:58:31,017
Thanks, George.
You're welcome.

1164
01:58:33,387 --> 01:58:34,877
Coming along.

1165
01:58:36,188 --> 01:58:37,848
Could he be ready?

1166
01:58:38,688 --> 01:58:41,488
For what?
Come on. You know what.

1167
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:52,298
Top of the morning to you.

1168
01:58:52,469 --> 01:58:55,379
That's a nice colt.
Who is he?

1169
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,710
Just a two-year-old.
He's not ready yet.

1170
01:58:58,750 --> 01:59:00,010
l thought maybe
you were getting a horse

1171
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:01,309
ready for the Hundred Grander.

1172
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:03,779
No. Just a two-year-old.

1173
01:59:06,351 --> 01:59:07,950
Hair of the dog.

1174
01:59:10,291 --> 01:59:12,990
You been here long?
No. Just got here.

1175
01:59:13,131 --> 01:59:15,191
Catching up on my reading.

1176
01:59:15,902 --> 01:59:18,961
Well, l'm sure
l'll see you soon.
Okey-dokey.

1177
01:59:24,372 --> 01:59:27,742
Stop the presses!
Stop the presses!
This isn't a scoop, folks.

1178
01:59:27,813 --> 01:59:30,902
This is three scoops
with hot fudge
and a cherry on top.

1179
01:59:30,982 --> 01:59:35,352
And throw in some nuts,
'cause this little horse
drives me crazy!

1180
01:59:36,253 --> 01:59:38,743
Guess who may be working
six furlongs next Friday.

1181
01:59:38,824 --> 01:59:40,584
Guess who may be shooting
for the Big 'Cap.

1182
01:59:40,663 --> 01:59:41,992
Oh, my saints alive!

1183
01:59:42,063 --> 01:59:44,223
You guessed it. Man, oh, man!

1184
01:59:44,294 --> 01:59:45,954
Did you ever guess it!

1185
02:00:01,315 --> 02:00:04,644
A minute 12, minute 13.
Something like that.

1186
02:00:05,616 --> 02:00:08,176
lf he starts to labor,
just slow it down.

1187
02:00:08,256 --> 02:00:10,385
Try and see how he feels...

1188
02:00:12,857 --> 02:00:14,086
Got you.

1189
02:00:23,907 --> 02:00:26,807
That's all right, Pops.
That's okay, boy. That's okay.

1190
02:00:26,877 --> 02:00:28,707
Come here. lt's okay, boy.

1191
02:00:40,018 --> 02:00:43,718
"And this, the most
unkindest cut of all."

1192
02:00:46,929 --> 02:00:50,229
Red. Red,
let me talk to you.

1193
02:00:50,299 --> 02:00:53,169
Talk to me?
You can't... Red!
You can't do it!

1194
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:54,859
You could be crippled
for the rest of your life.

1195
02:00:54,939 --> 02:00:58,309
l was crippled for the rest
of my life. l got better.

1196
02:00:58,710 --> 02:01:01,799
He made me better.
Hell, you made me better.

1197
02:01:05,421 --> 02:01:07,280
Jesus Christ.
Red...

1198
02:01:10,921 --> 02:01:13,860
And that's as much my horse
as it is yours.

1199
02:01:23,402 --> 02:01:25,842
That's pretty quick.
God damn it.

1200
02:01:27,543 --> 02:01:30,172
lt's up to him, Red.
Yeah, but if he says
that l can't...

1201
02:01:30,243 --> 02:01:32,573
He's the doctor.
lt's up to him.

1202
02:01:36,313 --> 02:01:37,612
You made this?

1203
02:01:39,223 --> 02:01:42,743
Yeah. lt wraps around
my riding boot,

1204
02:01:42,824 --> 02:01:45,194
fasten it all the way
up the calf.
Right.

1205
02:01:45,265 --> 02:01:47,955
l barely feel anything
in the stirrups.

1206
02:01:54,705 --> 02:01:57,905
Look, it could shatter
at any moment,
even right now.

1207
02:01:57,975 --> 02:01:59,305
Forget about racing.

1208
02:01:59,376 --> 02:02:02,206
You see that right there?
That's barely healed.

1209
02:02:02,275 --> 02:02:06,345
There's no way to know
how much weight
it could hold under stress.

1210
02:02:07,016 --> 02:02:11,076
lf it gets reinjured,
it's possible he could
never walk again.

1211
02:02:12,657 --> 02:02:15,596
"Possible." He just said
it was "possible."

1212
02:02:15,927 --> 02:02:19,127
Well, hell,
anything's possible. We proved
that already, didn't we?

1213
02:02:19,198 --> 02:02:23,137
Red, this is different.
Yeah!
This is really different.

1214
02:02:26,438 --> 02:02:30,377
lt's not just some race.
lt's the Santa Anita.

1215
02:02:31,248 --> 02:02:33,508
l had that race. l was there.

1216
02:02:34,478 --> 02:02:35,708
l know.

1217
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:48,459
What's going on?

1218
02:02:58,010 --> 02:03:02,341
Hell, even with the brace,
it'll barely hold him

1219
02:03:02,411 --> 02:03:04,901
if he gets bumped,
if he gets jostled...

1220
02:03:04,981 --> 02:03:07,680
Do you want to know
what l think?
Of course.

1221
02:03:07,751 --> 02:03:10,911
l think it's better to break
a man's leg than his heart.

1222
02:03:13,992 --> 02:03:16,462
lt's not just the leg.
lt's not!
Okay.

1223
02:03:16,523 --> 02:03:19,392
Mar, he could fall.
He could get trampled.

1224
02:03:19,692 --> 02:03:22,692
lf he gets thrown
from that horse...
He could die?

1225
02:03:35,084 --> 02:03:38,343
You know, l play
with this thing
all the time, too.

1226
02:03:41,054 --> 02:03:44,714
And no matter how hard l try,
l can't get that damn ball
to stay in the hole.

1227
02:03:46,955 --> 02:03:48,985
lt always rolls out again.

1228
02:03:57,136 --> 02:03:59,226
Just let him ride, Charles.

1229
02:04:01,075 --> 02:04:02,805
Just let him do it.

1230
02:04:10,487 --> 02:04:11,607
Jumping Jehoshaphat,

1231
02:04:11,687 --> 02:04:13,847
l could handle one comeback,
but this is ridiculous.

1232
02:04:13,917 --> 02:04:15,087
Who's next, Lazarus?

1233
02:04:15,157 --> 02:04:17,887
Oh, the heroism, the madness,
the excitement.

1234
02:04:17,957 --> 02:04:20,397
The largest crowd
ever to see a race
at Santa Anita!

1235
02:04:20,457 --> 02:04:23,657
55,000 in the stands,
20,000 in the infield,

1236
02:04:23,728 --> 02:04:26,068
and it's only 12:00!

1237
02:04:44,860 --> 02:04:46,080
lt's not bad.

1238
02:04:48,830 --> 02:04:51,560
St. Christopher. For luck.

1239
02:04:52,630 --> 02:04:55,390
A little late for that,
don't you think?

1240
02:05:02,541 --> 02:05:04,571
All right.
Let's go win us a race.

1241
02:05:21,393 --> 02:05:22,862
Ready?
Yeah.

1242
02:05:39,384 --> 02:05:41,243
Whichcee's the speed.

1243
02:05:41,815 --> 02:05:46,255
He's gonna be out on the lead,
but l don't think
he'll handle the distance.

1244
02:05:46,325 --> 02:05:48,845
Just stalk him like always.

1245
02:05:49,726 --> 02:05:51,125
Right.

1246
02:05:51,665 --> 02:05:54,184
Wedding Call
could make a late run.

1247
02:05:54,366 --> 02:05:57,165
Now, he's got some guts,
so look out for him, too.

1248
02:05:57,236 --> 02:05:59,496
Won't make that mistake again.

1249
02:06:04,207 --> 02:06:06,906
Relax, guys.
lt's gonna be fine.

1250
02:06:09,217 --> 02:06:10,337
Okay.

1251
02:06:35,139 --> 02:06:39,239
Charles, it's gonna be great.
Thank you, Frank.
Hope so. Bless you.

1252
02:06:39,310 --> 02:06:41,809
Good luck, Mr. Howard.
Thank you.

1253
02:06:50,090 --> 02:06:52,080
Good luck.
You're looking good.

1254
02:06:52,161 --> 02:06:53,850
Want a seat?

1255
02:06:56,231 --> 02:07:00,191
Relax. Buy you
a couple of drinks, huh?

1256
02:07:00,942 --> 02:07:02,702
That's a good idea.

1257
02:07:03,571 --> 02:07:05,301
Who you betting on?

1258
02:07:51,596 --> 02:07:53,055
Hey, old man.

1259
02:07:53,726 --> 02:07:56,456
What are you doing here?
Got another mount.

1260
02:07:56,527 --> 02:07:59,897
Just 'cause l'm not riding him
doesn't mean
l'm gonna sit it out.

1261
02:07:59,966 --> 02:08:02,526
Don't worry.
l don't stand a chance.

1262
02:08:03,667 --> 02:08:05,796
l'll see you at the finish.

1263
02:09:24,794 --> 02:09:26,193
Come on, boy.

1264
02:09:26,264 --> 02:09:28,524
Come on. Come on!

1265
02:09:35,805 --> 02:09:37,895
Come on! Go!

1266
02:09:57,357 --> 02:09:59,856
How you doing, Red?
Georgie.

1267
02:10:00,197 --> 02:10:01,957
You guys all right?

1268
02:10:05,567 --> 02:10:07,267
There you go, boy.

1269
02:10:09,878 --> 02:10:12,507
There it is.
Have a nice ride, Johnny.

1270
02:10:15,519 --> 02:10:17,038
Come on, Pops.

1271
02:10:17,118 --> 02:10:18,478
Ha! Ha!

1272
02:10:21,819 --> 02:10:24,019
Go home with it,
Johnny! Go on!

1273
02:10:34,330 --> 02:10:35,830
Come on, Red!

1274
02:10:45,681 --> 02:10:47,341
There it is, boy.

1275
02:10:48,221 --> 02:10:49,840
Come on, Biscuit!

1276
02:11:24,154 --> 02:11:27,093
You know,
everybody thinks we found
this broken-down horse

1277
02:11:27,155 --> 02:11:28,425
and fixed him,

1278
02:11:29,525 --> 02:11:31,085
but we didn't.

1279
02:11:33,795 --> 02:11:35,235
He fixed us.

1280
02:11:37,606 --> 02:11:39,196
Every one of us.

1281
02:11:41,176 --> 02:11:43,076
And l guess, in a way,

1282
02:11:44,947 --> 02:11:47,376
we kind of fixed
each other, too.
