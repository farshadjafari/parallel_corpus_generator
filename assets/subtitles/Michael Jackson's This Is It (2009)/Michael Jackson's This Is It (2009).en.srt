1
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,662
Where you from?

2
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,081
I'm from Holland, and this is like...

3
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,001
Ten hours for me.
It's, like, across the world.

4
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,836
I came here for this audition.

5
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,506
I told all my boys at home I'm coming
to funk in front of Michael onstage.

6
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:34,051
I'm just going to dance for him.
I don't care if I make it or nothing.

7
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,012
Thank you, Michael. I'm excited.

8
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:40,349
You've inspired everything in my life.
My energy.

9
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,851
You're why I dance.

10
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,188
I remember being a little girl
and watching "Thriller" with my mom...

11
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,982
...and thinking that was
the coolest thing in the world.

12
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:51,652
I go to sleep and just wake up,
and the first thing I do is not even eat.

13
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,696
I just start playing your music...

14
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,783
...and start just dancing
and moon walking on a rug.

15
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,411
I was like, "What I would give
to be onstage with you. "

16
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,624
And the fact that I get to do that
is amazing, so...

17
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,752
I'm from Australia...

18
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:15,760
And I got word of your audition two
days before it was about to happen...

19
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,763
...and I was on the next flight over.

20
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:23,100
It begins. This is the beginning.
I'm not even onstage yet.

21
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,062
Like, I can't even imagine
what's going to happen backstage...

22
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,482
- ... that first show in London.
- I'm looking even farther ahead.

23
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,902
I don't even know what I want to do
after this because this is Michael.

24
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,904
I wanted to dance,
you know what I mean?

25
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,782
And that inspiration came from,
you know, you.

26
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:42,245
And you've inspired me and given me
a reason to want to inspire others.

27
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,916
Life is hard, right?

28
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,419
I've kind of been searching for
something to shake me up a little bit...

29
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:55,675
...and give me a kind of a meaning,
to believe in something.

30
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:59,929
And this is it.

31
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,157
So we open the show, as you know,
with all the lights down.

32
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,870
We're going to create a spectacular
opening with pyrotechnics.

33
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,039
And we want some sizzles
and some cracks and some pops.

34
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,710
We have our video that is called
"Glimpses and Flashes. "

35
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,753
And that's where Light Man...

36
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,756
...comes out on the gantry,
floating above the stage...

37
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:41,053
...and he'll just be dazzling
in video information.

38
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,601
And piece by piece by piece by piece...

39
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,312
...MJ is revealed, until he jumps out...

40
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,316
...and on Michael's command,
we begin.

41
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,439
You know I'm going to
want that more, right?

42
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,441
It's funkier.

43
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,317
I'm not feeling that part enough.

44
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,116
As in running next to him.

45
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,951
- It's not there.
- Okay, it should be.

46
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,120
It should be. I know, it's all for love.

47
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,165
- It's coming there.
- We'll get it there.

48
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,733
Jackson's ETA is 15 minutes.

49
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,236
Michael Jackson last performed
live right here in London...

50
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,781
...at the 2006 World Music Awards.

51
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,409
Michael Jackson's here.
Go straight onstage.

52
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,161
This is it!

53
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,163
Yeah!

54
00:06:54,539 --> 00:07:01,545
This is it. This is it.

55
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,424
I love you.

56
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,761
We love you!

57
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:15,935
I'll be performing the songs
my fans want to hear.

58
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,940
This is really it.
This is the final curtain call.

59
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,819
Okay? And see you in July.

60
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,641
Good. Great. Good to see all of you.
Thank you for being here.

61
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,353
The idea was get the big fish from all
over and put them in the same pond.

62
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,860
The dancers in
a Michael Jackson show...

63
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,280
...are an extension
of Michael Jackson.

64
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,991
They are an extension of the man.

65
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,661
Everything is bigger
and more intense in his world.

66
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,371
First cut, thank you.

67
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,797
Next group. Ladies, brave.

68
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,554
Lean, gorgeous, hot.

69
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,682
Dancers that can rock it.
But if you don't have that goo...

70
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,768
...that ooze coming out of you,
not going to get the job.

71
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,909
She's the one.

72
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:08,792
And the Michael Jackson principal
dancers for This Is It are:

73
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,602
Guys, those go over here.

74
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,731
Hey, guys?
Those go over here, actually.

75
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,816
Truss moving.

76
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,199
Quite the eventful day
because we got to be toasted.

77
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,078
There's elevator speed
and toaster speed.

78
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,498
Part of this, guys,
is anticipating the stop.

79
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,126
Keep your shoulders square,
keep your centre...

80
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,713
...and just get right down into
a nice, good squat position like that...

81
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,465
...and you're going to come up and-

82
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,134
- You feel that initial-?
- Yeah, I do.

83
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,969
Yeah, that's the adrenaline, baby.

84
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,533
We're at Culver Studios,
shooting green screen.

85
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,077
We're going to do "The Drill"
into "Cadence"...

86
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,954
...into "They Don't Really
Care About Us. "

87
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,207
It's going to be really cool because
they're going to multiply the guys.

88
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:22,337
So our existing 11 guys
are going to become 1100 guys...

89
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,256
...and it'll be really, really cool.

90
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,883
So we're kind of excited.
And Michael's coming today.

91
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,262
- There's the man. The man is here.
- There's Michael.

92
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,766
So that we can give you this:
a million people.

93
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,893
Michael, do you like this, first of all?

94
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,981
Yeah, that's a cool move, a cool move,
but it spreads out too much to the end.

95
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,692
So we can just stop it
whenever you hit the space bar.

96
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,235
You can go to infinity.

97
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,070
Yeah. As though
there's no more than...

98
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:52,075
...1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10?
Or maybe just your nine dancers?

99
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,493
- Ten.
- Ten. Great.

100
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,625
What is that?

101
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,546
One more time. Six, seven, eight...

102
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,998
In what will go down in history...

103
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:51,421
...as the greatest demonstration
for freedom in the history of our nation.

104
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,851
Hold for applause, hold for applause.

105
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,104
Slow umbrella fade out.

106
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,488
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Let's just go for it.

107
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,337
You sound great, MJ.
You sound great.

108
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:03,011
Bam, something right there.

109
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:22,854
We're seconds away, Mike.

110
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,105
- Rolling.
- Rolling.

111
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,524
And Gilda singing.

112
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,786
Bravo!

113
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,798
What's he doing here?

114
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,189
And cut. That was a good one.

115
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,815
Let's cut.

116
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,067
- Okay, Bruce?
- Yes, sir?

117
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,444
Rehearsed, and Michael was great.
We can do this.

118
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:12,654
- Ready to shoot?
- Yup.

119
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:16,449
- Okay, guys, let's shoot this.
- Here we go, ready. We are...

120
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,159
- ... rolling.
- Action.

121
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,006
What do you want me to do?
Count three like they do in the movies?

122
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,564
Guys, that's the cue.

123
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,067
I'm sorry, are we misunderstanding
something here?

124
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,528
- No, we're not misunderstanding.
- We're sizzling.

125
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,071
- He's sizzling.
- I'm sizzling.

126
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,240
He's waiting for my point,
it's coming.

127
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:02,620
Michael, I was telling them to start
when you turn toward the audience.

128
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:07,000
Oh, no, I want to turn first,
face the audience with nothing.

129
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,419
- Okay.
- And then when he gets my cue...

130
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,296
- ... then we go.
- The only thing is...

131
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:15,883
...how will you see the video change
from the marquee to the city?

132
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,761
I got to feel that.
I'll feel it, the screen behind me.

133
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:24,809
All right. Now this is all sizzle, sizzle,
sizzle. It says "Smooth Criminal. "

134
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:29,230
The audience is going wild.
The camera slowly starts to move...

135
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,733
...over the marquee.

136
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,506
Pretty good... Pretty good.

137
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,691
You're going to put that in?

138
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,738
It's really cool for me
as a musical director...

139
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,073
...because I need the artist
to be hands-on...

140
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:34,660
...and MJ is always hands-on
with everything he does.

141
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,496
He knows all of his records.
He knows all of his tempos.

142
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,082
He knows all of his keys
of songs.

143
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,835
Just a little drag,
a little bit more behind the beat.

144
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,712
Yeah. It's not the right sound.

145
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,714
Like you're dragging yourself
out of bed.

146
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,300
Imagine this is the right sound.
Check this.

147
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,558
Don't change so soon, though.

148
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:01,270
Don't want to change over so soon yet.
See, you're going:

149
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,870
Don't do that one.
Don't do that one.

150
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,039
- Don't do that one yet?
- No, no.

151
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,791
It should be simpler.

152
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,387
Yeah.

153
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,100
We'll get the sound,
we'll get the sound.

154
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,435
We'll get the sound
but that's not till tomorrow.

155
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,938
We got to do a sound check
tomorrow night.

156
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,272
That's what we need to do.

157
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,566
And don't start unless
you do a sound check.

158
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,527
I know, that's why we doing it.

159
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,404
We need you to do the sound check...

160
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,948
...because can't nobody hear
what you need to hear.

161
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,158
Some people might
not want to have that bass-

162
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,993
I want it the way I wrote it. I mean-

163
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,204
Like the audience hears it.

164
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:03,332
So whatever the record's doing,
that's how I want it to sound.

165
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:07,294
That's what it's going to sound like, but
you got to get closer to what you want.

166
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,672
Then if you want to hear
a little more booty...

167
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,882
...on something else,
know what I mean?

168
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,510
Only you can say that.
You know what I'm saying?

169
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,470
A little more booty.

170
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,972
That's funny.

171
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,641
But you knew what I meant though too.

172
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:23,060
I know exactly what you meant.

173
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,563
One more time from the top.

174
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,543
Try to get the same sound.

175
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,760
Good sound on that. Good sound.

176
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:01,599
No, no, not yet, Prince.

177
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,058
No. You got to-

178
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,644
You got to let it simmer.

179
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,730
It's got a moment
where it has to simmer.

180
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,357
- That's right.
- You're not letting it simmer.

181
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,528
Just bathe in the moonlight. You
have to let it simmer a bit, you know?

182
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:19,366
All right, Prince?
We're going to add two bars after the:

183
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,535
Or at least a bar.

184
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:27,041
Yeah. MJ, check it from the top again.
See what we got, simmer-wise.

185
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,461
One, two, three, four.

186
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,052
I got to cue that. I got to cue that.

187
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:05,306
- That shouldn't trigger on its own.
- That's a special on our girl.

188
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,516
That can't trigger on its own.

189
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,560
I got to cue that.

190
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,356
So you got to watch me
for that growl, okay?

191
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,607
One more time.

192
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,446
That's why we rehearse.

193
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,699
It's okay, it's okay.
Right here on this one.

194
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,663
They wanted us to take
those eight out so-

195
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,374
It's okay, it's okay, no.
It was a little too soon.

196
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,626
- Yeah, I agree, Michael.
- Yeah.

197
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,671
- I think let's add them back.
- Just leave it.

198
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,841
You don't feel totally nourished by it,
you know?

199
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,761
MJ, we'll also have a fan there,
right there in the centre.

200
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,637
I'm trying to hear you.
Say it again?

201
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,807
There'll be a fan,
right there off the stage for you.

202
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:56,018
Boom, right there.

203
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,645
Okay, watching Michael.

204
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:10,509
Once again, ladies and gentlemen,
the world's most fabulous group:

205
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,344
The Jackson 5.

206
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,255
Everybody clap your hands.
Come on!

207
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,931
You guys, I got to tell you this.

208
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,933
When I'm trying to hear
and it feels like...

209
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,935
...somebody's fist is
pushed into my ear...

210
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,103
...it's really very difficult.

211
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,105
I know you mean well, so, but it's...

212
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:50,984
I'm trying to adjust to the ear,
the inner ears, okay?

213
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,528
With the love, with the love. L-O-V-E.

214
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,198
- Michael.
- This is not easy though.

215
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,825
Michael, one more time.
I couldn't hear you, sir.

216
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,496
The inner ears are very difficult for me
when you're raised...

217
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:07,542
...to use just your real own,
you know, aural- Auditory ears.

218
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:11,672
Now it feels like somebody's fist,
just their fist, is shoved into your ear.

219
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,925
- Okay.
- I'm trying to hear and I can't.

220
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,636
So I'm adjusting to the situation.

221
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,555
Right. Michael, is there anything
they can give you now...

222
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:24,935
...in your ears to make it better
in terms of volume or mix?

223
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,064
If we could just bring it down
a little bit.

224
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,650
Bring it down a little bit, please.

225
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:35,112
Anything else, Michael?
You want to hear more of anything?

226
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,364
You want to hear more voice,
want to hear more-?

227
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,533
- No.
- Okay, Michael, after the next song...

228
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,494
...if it hasn't adjusted to your liking,
please let us know?

229
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:43,870
- For sure.
- Thank you.

230
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,373
Would you like to pick it up from...?

231
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,501
- "Stop! The Love You Save. "
- "Stop! The Love You Save. "

232
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,564
God bless you.

233
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,132
Everybody!

234
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,926
I'll say, "Jackie, Jermaine, Marlon...

235
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:30,263
...Tito, Randy, I love you.

236
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:35,310
Joseph and Katherine,
God bless you. I love you. "

237
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,533
Just trying to conserve my throat,
please, so understand.

238
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,907
- And blackout.
- We'll make it cleaner at the back.

239
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:35,370
So you want to get rid of the bad
specials, those profiles coming in.

240
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,414
There's a lot going on. The dancers...

241
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,250
...we do maintenance with them
two to three times a week.

242
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:44,045
We do Pilates and stretching and
ballet, and they have physical therapy.

243
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,214
You know,
just keeping everybody together.

244
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,758
I saw you, you were going like this,
what is this?

245
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,302
That's Russian. This is Russian.

246
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,512
So Baryshnikov does it like this...

247
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,931
...and you guys are doing like this.
Same thing.

248
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,809
- Good.
- One more time.

249
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,562
But we're straight up
and down now, right?

250
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,315
I don't think it's anything
except hand moving.

251
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:06,109
I think that's smoother,
you know what I mean?

252
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,194
I mean, I have nothing to move.

253
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,197
Dancers, music.

254
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,141
Oh, my gosh.

255
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,690
All right, "I Just Can't Stop
Loving You. " Judith.

256
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,149
Let me know when you're ready.

257
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:34,406
A mi amour eras atº

258
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:39,911
Cando no esters

259
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,332
A mi amour  

260
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,253
Do it for Ortega.

261
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:50,463
- Ortega.
- Here we go.

262
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,049
For his people.

263
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:57,262
One, two, three.

264
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,348
More echo in here?

265
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,709
Now, don't make me sing out
when I shouldn't be singing out.

266
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:24,255
I'm warming- I'm trying to warm up
my voice for this moment.

267
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:27,759
Why do you do this to me?
I shouldn't be singing right now.

268
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,805
- No. No, no.
- You better sing!

269
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:36,642
I'm warming up to the moment.

270
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:41,230
- But you just can't help it, MJ.
- No, but, I shouldn't. I really shouldn't.

271
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,274
- Yeah, but you felt it.
- No, no.

272
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:45,568
But you can allow yourself
that one time.

273
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:47,070
I can't do that.

274
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,489
But you're fine to do it.
I got to save my voice.

275
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:53,409
That ending was just like
the smelliest ending of all the versions.

276
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,787
Band, it's just this.

277
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,998
This is what it is.

278
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,509
What day is it?
What time is it?

279
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:12,845
We're down to the wire. We're
like halfway through our film shoot...

280
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:16,766
...for all of our incredible
new film content for This Is It.

281
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:22,730
Today we are filming new segments
for "Thriller," 3-D.

282
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,830
- Do I still have on my 3-D glasses?
- Yes.

283
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,373
Oh, good.

284
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:43,167
I think I look great in these glasses.

285
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:45,253
Do I look as old as I feel?

286
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,757
Guys, please step away if you're not
in the shot. Photographers, everybody.

287
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,676
Clear the set now for the crew.

288
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,970
- Rolling!
- Here we go.

289
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:55,847
Action.

290
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,810
This guy should be getting out soon.

291
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,730
- You guys, be aware of the camera.
- Look up to it.

292
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,275
There's going to be light on him.
No light on him now.

293
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,818
Give the information to him.

294
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,154
Gravedigger, right into the camera.
Put your-

295
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:14,407
There it is. Right into it, right in there.
That's it, keep going.

296
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:15,783
- Right there.
- That's it.

297
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,870
Right into the camera.
Reach your hands out in front of you.

298
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,873
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- That's it, beautiful!

299
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:26,377
Keep coming. Yeah, right into the lens.
I'm in the centre of the camera.

300
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:27,837
There you go.

301
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:34,051
Now, go out. Go out. Good. And cut.
It's brilliant. Thank you, everybody.

302
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:43,686
We call these the dead brides
and the dead grooms.

303
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:48,608
And there'll be a parade of them
moving through the aisles in "Thriller. "

304
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,600
Darkness falls across the land

305
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:26,229
The midnight hour is close at hand

306
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:29,774
Creatures crawl in search of blood

307
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,985
 neighbourhood

308
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:36,656
And whosoever shall be found

309
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:39,659
Without the soul for getting down

310
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:44,163
Must stand and face the hounds of hell

311
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:47,500
And rot inside a corpse's shell

312
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:28,744
The demons squeal in sheer delight

313
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:33,666
It's you they spy, so plump, so right

314
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,836
For though the groove is hard to beat

315
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,964
Yet still you stand with frozen feet

316
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,175
You try to run, you try to scream

317
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:46,846
But no more sun you'll ever see

318
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:49,807
For evil reaches from the crypt

319
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:53,102
To crush you in its icy grip

320
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,907
Make sure that there's somebody
waiting for Michael there...

321
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:32,868
...with a flashlight and everything.
Great.

322
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:50,177
Now, you know,
could we do that times 10?

323
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:51,804
Absolutely!

324
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,099
Okay, so next is the fire screen.

325
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,393
We're going to show you
some chase sequences.

326
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:16,287
Rock 'n' roll!

327
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:32,595
Today was all about...

328
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:36,515
...testing the chandelier
and bed props for the show...

329
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:39,518
...with our aerialists
and pole-dancing experts.

330
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,271
It's all about
checking dimension...

331
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:46,150
- ... widths, pipe, how things work.
- Building props with people on it...

332
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,527
...is a big responsibility
and a lot of fun...

333
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,489
...because we have to design things
around the human body.

334
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,953
This is the first time in the history
we've worked with Michael...

335
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:02,166
...for the past 25 years that
we are including lighted elements...

336
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,876
...in his "Billie Jean" costume.

337
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:06,629
The cut of the stones,
the refraction of the light...

338
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:10,257
...as we're applying, you almost
need sunglasses, just the reflection.

339
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,217
We're bringing things
into his performance...

340
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:16,305
...where they haven't been developed.
It's just being developed for Michael.

341
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,557
I'm working with scientists
in the Netherlands...

342
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,352
...with people in California,
working with Swarovski.

343
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:25,397
Always trying to push the boundaries
because that's what Michael's about.

344
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:30,569
Now, is this working this evening?

345
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,906
Without running the number,
if Michael would like to...

346
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:37,701
...just to give him a little ride so that
he feels his new cherry picker out.

347
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,411
From the top of "Beat It. "

348
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:42,539
- You want to do it with music already?
- Yeah.

349
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,875
Can I just give you a ride first?

350
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:46,418
- Sure. If you want.
- Okay.

351
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:49,922
Yeah. Just for safety. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Michael.

352
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,716
- Sure. Sure.
- Daredevil MJ.

353
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,719
- I trust in you.
- Thank you.

354
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:58,222
Just for safety. Thank you.

355
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,516
Stand by, guys.

356
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,603
You've been there before.

357
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:09,024
MJ, this is just at mid-height.

358
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:11,944
It goes much higher than this.

359
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:14,363
This is the low height.

360
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:17,449
Why would you say that to me?
You know better.

361
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,952
See, why did you say that to him?

362
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,079
He's teasing me. That's why.

363
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:24,623
He know I wants to go higher.

364
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,042
God bless you, Kenny.

365
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:28,544
Hi.

366
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:32,131
Yeah, yeah.
Are the fans working on this?

367
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,632
It's great.

368
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,426
Michael, please hold on.

369
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,345
- Thank you.
- It's very nice.

370
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,597
- Yeah? Is it smooth?
- Yeah.

371
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:45,144
Great. This is monumental,
Michael's back on the cherry picker.

372
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,312
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

373
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,275
- We love you, Michael.
- Love you too.

374
01:12:45,153 --> 01:12:48,155
Okay, that's where you want it?
When we come up-

375
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:49,781
What we're doing is...

376
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,658
We're doing it for the height.

377
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:54,036
I'm going to take off the jacket...

378
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:57,748
...and kick it, and beat it, and beat it
and we're going to burn it.

379
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,709
The jacket's going to be too hot.
It's going to be on fire.

380
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,294
I just wanted to know
when that last one was.

381
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:05,297
That's the one, I was pointing to it.

382
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,801
I was pointing that to you.

383
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:13,889
I got you.
You don't have to do it again.

384
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,058
We can. Do it again.

385
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:18,477
Here it is right here,
just do me the last one.

386
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,812
Come on the one before it.

387
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,773
Let's go on to C. One before.

388
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:12,447
And let it burn, and the lights out!

389
01:14:12,824 --> 01:14:14,282
Lights out.

390
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:16,660
Lights out! Let it burn!

391
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,037
We're on a 10-minute break.

392
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,541
I'm just so happy.
This is a dream come true.

393
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:26,336
When MJ comes in the room
to rehearse with us...

394
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:31,174
...his presence is just amazing. It's
pretty, pretty cool. Really, really cool.

395
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:37,139
Thank you.

396
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:42,727
Michael is the epitome of one of
the great entertainers of our time.

397
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:46,189
Performing with Michael
has just been a thrill.

398
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:50,193
I've been a Michael Jackson fan
since he was 8.

399
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:53,697
It's like a lifelong dream for me
to actually work with Michael.

400
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:56,408
I've worked with
a lot of great, great artists...

401
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,994
...but I consider this,
like, really a pinnacle.

402
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,912
Michael's a perfectionist.

403
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,541
You don't find that in pop musicians.
You can't fool Michael.

404
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,543
You have to come in
knowing the record.

405
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:08,712
Then, hopefully,
finding a middle ground...

406
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,922
...to embellish it
to make it even better.

407
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,884
He's just an icon of performance.

408
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:17,929
His talent runs so deep in creativity.
And he draws from a deeper emotion...

409
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,432
...than anybody else
I've ever seen or worked with.

410
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:23,185
Right here, right here, right here.

411
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:26,813
Okay, no second verse.
Sorry. Okay, sorry, sorry.

412
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:30,942
That was a mistake, there is no second
verse. Sorry about that, you guys.

413
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:34,362
First verse, then right to the bridge,
okay?

414
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:36,698
- Let's do it one more time.
- Sure.

415
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:39,409
- Want to go down then come back up?
- One more time.

416
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:42,454
- This is why we have rehearsal.
- There you go.

417
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:39,511
So we'll run this way.

418
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:36,628
When they stop, you have to just keep-
Just hit your highest note.

419
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:39,005
It's time for you to shine.

420
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:45,553
And hit a high, long one.

421
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:47,806
I mean, way up there.

422
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:51,309
It's your time to shine.

423
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:54,062
We'll be right there with you.

424
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:09,661
It's remarkable. It's some genius stuff
going on over here, man.

425
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,747
He is the king.

426
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,542
And he's a good guy too.
He's real humble.

427
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,627
You know. And he knows his music.

428
01:19:17,837 --> 01:19:21,464
What more can you ask for? Because
I'm searching for that flavour too.

429
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:45,256
Look at that. I think it's beautiful.

430
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:47,509
Show him the second one.

431
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:50,136
- It'll come rolling out at us, right?
- Yes.

432
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:52,847
- All golden. Look at this.
- It'll be floating so much.

433
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,390
I love her. I love the light.

434
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:57,644
- God, and the lighting's great.
- Yeah. You got it.

435
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:09,447
I respect the secrets
and magic of nature.

436
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:13,910
That's why it makes me so angry when
I see these things that are happening.

437
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,788
That every second, I hear,
the size of a football field...

438
01:21:16,956 --> 01:21:18,665
...is torn down in the Amazon.

439
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,292
I mean, that kind of stuff
really bothers me.

440
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,045
That's why I write these kind of songs,
you know.

441
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:28,174
It gives some sense of awareness
and awakening and hope to people.

442
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:30,760
I love the planet.

443
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:36,099
I love trees. I have this thing for trees,
and the colours and changing of leaves.

444
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:40,436
I love it.
And I respect those kind of things.

445
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:08,366
The value would be greater...

446
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:10,534
...you let it rumble...

447
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:14,121
...let it stay open,
let it close in silence.

448
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:21,087
And when that door opens,
you start that piano.

449
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:27,718
God bless you.

450
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,471
I really feel that nature
is trying so hard...

451
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:35,017
...to compensate for man's
mismanagement of the planet.

452
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:38,688
Because the planet is sick.
Like a fever.

453
01:28:38,897 --> 01:28:42,066
If we don't fix it now,
it's at the point of no return.

454
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:45,736
This is our last chance
to fix this problem that we have...

455
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:48,197
...where it's like a runaway train...

456
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:50,658
...and the time has come.
This is it.

457
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:52,827
I love you.

458
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:56,247
That'll be the ending
of this under the words.

459
01:29:00,127 --> 01:29:03,713
People are always saying, "They'll
take care of it. The governmental-

460
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:08,259
Don't worry. They'll-"
"They" who? It starts with us. It's us.

461
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,886
Or else it'll never be done.

462
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:17,518
Guys, can I have the lighting crew?

463
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:19,937
- Travis?
- Yeah!

464
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,773
First of all, Michael will be
coming on from offstage...

465
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:25,109
...and he's got, like, an attaché© case.

466
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:28,446
And right here, Michael,
you call it here.

467
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:33,200
So now it comes here. So it's a light
that is moving on his command.

468
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,786
- Absolutely.
- Right? Then when he moves forward...

469
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:37,621
- ... he's in that light.
- Yeah.

470
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,081
He's in that light.

471
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:42,293
But I want to be able to step
into the pool once I'm fully dressed.

472
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:45,796
So then- So after he does this-
Why don't you do this, Michael?

473
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:48,424
After you go like this
and you send that down...

474
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:50,968
...a gesture and a pool of light
comes on.

475
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:53,471
Now a pool of light comes on
down here...

476
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:56,474
- ... wherever his light is...
- Yeah.

477
01:29:56,683 --> 01:30:02,271
...and the pool of light comes on
and now he'll walk into it, centre stage.

478
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:06,984
And now he'll start.

479
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,864
I know.

480
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:29,783
At least we get a feel of it.

481
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:32,119
God bless you.

482
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,131
Church.

483
01:36:45,008 --> 01:36:47,676
The church of rock 'n' roll.

484
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:50,596
I'm a fan.

485
01:36:50,847 --> 01:36:52,055
God bless you.

486
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:53,515
Get some water.

487
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:55,893
Water, water...

488
01:36:58,188 --> 01:37:01,231
I just want to say as Michael's
creative partner in this venture...

489
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:04,401
...this has been one of the most
extraordinary experiences...

490
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:08,739
...of my creative life. I am so proud
and so thrilled and so excited...

491
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:12,034
...and I just want to thank everybody
for their extraordinary work.

492
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:15,496
And I'm going to just give this
to Michael now.

493
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:18,123
Everybody's doing a great job.

494
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:22,711
Let's continue
and believe and have faith.

495
01:37:22,921 --> 01:37:28,050
Give me your all, your endurance,
your patience and your understanding.

496
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:31,929
But it's an adventure,
it's a great adventure.

497
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:34,014
It's nothing to be nervous about.

498
01:37:34,224 --> 01:37:37,392
They just want wonderful experiences,
they want escapism.

499
01:37:37,644 --> 01:37:40,354
We want to take them places
that they've never been before.

500
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:43,273
We want to show them talent
like they've never seen before.

501
01:37:43,525 --> 01:37:44,942
So give your all.

502
01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:48,529
And I love you all. And we're a family.
Just know that. We're a family.

503
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:49,947
- That's right.
- Amen.

504
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:52,074
We're putting love
back into the world...

505
01:37:52,242 --> 01:37:55,702
...to remind the world
that love is important.

506
01:37:55,912 --> 01:37:59,289
Love is important. To love each other.
We're all one. That's the message.

507
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:01,124
And take care of the planet.

508
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:03,085
We have four years to get it right...

509
01:38:03,253 --> 01:38:05,754
...or else it's irreversible,
the damage we've done.

510
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:10,300
So we have an important message
to give. Okay? It's important.

511
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:14,930
But I thank you for your cooperation
so far. Thank you. Big thank you.

512
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:19,643
Blessings! Blessings to all.

513
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:22,062
Michael Jackson!

514
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:32,406
Have a beautiful Sunday.

515
01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:34,992
- Be safe. Stay healthy.
- Energy!

516
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:46,003
On three! On three, "Michael. "

517
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:47,671
One, two, three!

518
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:49,506
Michael!

519
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:57,139
What I'd like to do right now is just run,
for a sound check, "Man in the Mirror. "

520
01:38:57,348 --> 01:39:00,017
- Okay.
- And then we'll talk about the ending.

521
01:39:00,268 --> 01:39:02,311
MJ Air.

522
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:04,855
Your favourite part.

523
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:06,857
Right?

524
01:39:07,734 --> 01:39:09,818
- They'd love that.
- You have to do it like MJ.

525
01:39:10,028 --> 01:39:11,028
No, no, no.

526
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:12,529
You know you love that part.

527
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:13,739
I love when you...

528
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:15,490
No, no.

529
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:19,745
That's how the stewardesses do it,
I love when they do that.

530
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,496
I love it.

531
01:39:21,748 --> 01:39:25,959
In third grade, the first song
I sang was "Man in the Mirror. "

532
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:28,712
So it's kind of cool, like,
going from that to this...

533
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,048
...singing it onstage with Michael,
you know.

534
01:39:31,257 --> 01:39:34,051
So it's just an amazing experience
to be onstage with him.

535
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:36,386
He's such an amazing artist.

536
01:49:42,368 --> 01:49:45,245
- There should be a break there.
- Yeah, we got to work that out.

537
01:49:45,454 --> 01:49:48,414
- Have it right there, okay?
- Yeah, we got to work that one out.

538
01:49:48,666 --> 01:49:51,084
Let me bathe in my own time
when I come back in.

539
01:49:51,293 --> 01:49:52,669
Yeah, you got it.

540
01:49:52,878 --> 01:49:56,798
I'm going to button my shirt
or my jacket or whatever it is.

541
01:49:57,007 --> 01:50:00,385
I'm going to look around a little bit,
play with them.

542
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:04,472
Snap my fingers maybe, then bam!
