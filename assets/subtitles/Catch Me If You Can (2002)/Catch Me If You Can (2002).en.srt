00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:09,836
JOE GARAGIOLA:
Thank you very much

2
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:11,171
and welcome to
<i>To Tell the Truth.</i>

3
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:13,140
Our first guest,
he's made a career

4
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:15,642
out of being the most
outrageous impostor

5
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:17,711
that we've ever come
across on this show

6
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:19,612
and you're going to
see what I mean.

7
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:22,549
ANNOUNCER: Number One,
what is your name, please?

8
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,384
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.

9
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:25,719
Number Two?

10
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,054
My name is Frank William Abagnale.

11
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:29,389
Number Three?

12
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,558
My name is Frank William Abagnale.

13
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:35,779
GARAGIOLA: "From 1964 to 1967,
I successfully impersonated

14
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,448
"an airline pilot
for Pan Am Airways

15
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:41,718
"and I flew over
two million miles for free.

16
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:45,388
"During that time, I was also
the chief resident pediatrician

17
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,323
"at a Georgia hospital

18
00:03:47,324 --> 00:03:49,358
"and an assistant
attorney general

19
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,094
"for the State of Louisiana.

20
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:53,463
"By the time I was caught,
I was considered

21
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:56,466
"the youngest and most daring
con man in U.S. history.

22
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:59,903
"I had cashed almost $4 million
in fraudulent checks

23
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:03,272
"in 26 foreign countries
and all 50 states.

24
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:06,643
"And I did it all
before my 19th birthday.

25
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:09,746
My name is Frank William Abagnale."

26
00:04:14,152 --> 00:04:15,719
So, for the first time

27
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,320
he's going to have
to tell the truth

28
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,689
and we're going to start
our questioning with Kitty.

29
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,391
Thank you. Number One,
why, with all your talent...

30
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:24,761
and you're obviously
a very bright fellow...

31
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:27,463
why didn't you go in
for a legitimate profession?

32
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:30,000
It was really a question
of dollars and cents.

33
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,335
When I was a young man,
I needed the money

34
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:34,203
and I thought
this list of careers

35
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:35,905
was the easiest way to get it.

36
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:37,273
I see.

37
00:04:37,274 --> 00:04:39,709
Number Two, I find this all
very fascinating.

38
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,645
Who was it
that finally caught you?

39
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:43,913
His name was Carl Hanratty.

40
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:45,949
Han-an-an-ratty.

41
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,150
Ratty.

42
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:48,584
Hanratty.

43
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:49,619
Han-ratty.

44
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,921
Carl Hanratty.

45
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:53,289
Yes. I...

46
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,892
am... Carl Hanratty.

47
00:04:55,893 --> 00:05:00,296
I represent the FBI from
the United States of America.

48
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:03,733
Yeah. I have orders

49
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:06,670
to see the American
prisoner, Abagnale.

50
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:37,000
You sit here.

51
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:39,836
You do not open the door.

52
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:43,506
You do not pass him...

53
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:46,876
anything through the hole.

54
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,521
Aw... Jesus.

55
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:21,144
You know, I've got
a little bit of a cold myself.

56
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,411
Frank...

57
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:25,081
I'm here to read
the articles of extradition

58
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:27,650
according to the
European Court for Human Rights.

59
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,286
"Article One:
Extradition shall be granted

60
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:32,521
"in respect of offenses
punishable under the laws..."

61
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:33,890
Help me.

62
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:36,092
"...for the maximum period
of at least one year

63
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:38,394
of a severe penalty."

64
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:39,562
Help me.

65
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:42,698
Frank... stop it.

66
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:45,001
Help me.

67
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:47,670
You don't think actually
you can fool me, do you?

68
00:06:49,673 --> 00:06:51,975
16 pages to go.
Stay with me.

69
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:54,210
Article Two:

70
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:55,779
"If the request for extradition

71
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,513
"includes several separate
offenses

72
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:58,948
each of which is punishable
under the laws..."

73
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,284
"of the requesting party..."

74
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:03,486
Frank?

75
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:07,556
Frank?

76
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:08,658
Goddamn it!

77
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:11,560
Get me a doctor in here!

78
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:13,062
Yes.
I need a doctor!

79
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:14,430
Doctor! Now!

80
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,932
HANRATTY:
Don't sweat it, Frank.

81
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,901
We're going to get you
right to a doctor.

82
00:07:21,172 --> 00:07:23,072
Frank, if you can
hear me, don't worry.

83
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:25,108
I'm going to take you
home in the morning.

84
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:26,442
Home in the morning, Frank.

85
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,115
What are you doing?

86
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:33,449
Washing off the lice.

87
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,885
This man has to be on a plane
for America.

88
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:37,287
He has to see a doctor.

89
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:38,988
The doctor comes in tomorrow.

90
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:40,957
I have worked too long,
too hard

91
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,092
for you to take
this away from me.

92
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:45,628
If he dies, I'm holding
you responsible.

93
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:53,403
Monsieur!

94
00:07:57,607 --> 00:07:59,408
Ah, Frank.

95
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:43,386
Okay, Carl...

96
00:08:43,387 --> 00:08:46,489
let's go home.

97
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,092
MAN:
<i>The New Rochelle Rotary Club</i>

98
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:52,128
<i>has a history</i>
<i>that goes back to 1919.</i>

99
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:53,596
In all those years

100
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:57,466
we've only seen a handful
of deserving gentlemen

101
00:08:57,467 --> 00:09:00,336
inducted as lifetime members.

102
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:02,372
It's an honor that, uh

103
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:07,176
that has seen 57 names enshrined
on the wall of honor

104
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:09,712
and tonight, we make it 58.

105
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:13,182
So please stand as I present
my very good friend

106
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:15,818
a man who keeps
our pencils sharp...

107
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:19,055
and our pens in ink...

108
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:21,724
Frank William Abagnale.

109
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:43,212
I stand here humbled

110
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:46,416
by the presence
of Mayor Robert Wagner...

111
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:53,923
and our club president,
Jack Barnes.

112
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:02,765
Most of all, I'm honored to see
my loving wife Paula...

113
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:08,871
and my son, Frank Jr....

114
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:11,040
Frank... Aw, stand up.
Come on...

115
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:17,013
...sitting in the front row.

116
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:26,589
Two little mice fell
in a bucket of cream.

117
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:31,494
The first mouse quickly gave up
and drowned.

118
00:10:31,495 --> 00:10:35,865
The second mouse...
wouldn't quit.

119
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,367
He struggled so hard

120
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:41,004
that eventually he churned
that cream into butter

121
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:42,905
and crawled out.

122
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:47,210
Gentlemen, as of this moment,
I am that second mouse.

123
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:07,063
PAULA: You're a better dancer
than your father, Frankie.

124
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:08,664
You hear that, Daddy?

125
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:09,865
FRANK SR.:
Like fun.

126
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:11,867
PAULA: The girls don't
know what they're in for.

127
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:14,904
Show him the dance
you were doing when we met.

128
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:16,339
Ah, who can remember?

129
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,874
The people
in that little French village

130
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,776
were so happy to see Americans

131
00:11:20,777 --> 00:11:23,146
they decided
to put on a show for us.

132
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:25,148
So they crammed 200 soldiers...

133
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,150
Yeah, we know the story, Daddy.

134
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:29,052
into that tiny social hall

135
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:31,387
and the first person
to walk onstage

136
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:34,023
is your mother, and
she starts to dance.

137
00:11:34,024 --> 00:11:35,358
You know

138
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:39,195
it had been months
since we'd even seen a woman

139
00:11:39,196 --> 00:11:41,063
and here's this blonde angel.

140
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:42,531
Blonde bombshell.

141
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:47,703
And the men are literally
holding their breath.

142
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:49,272
Holding their breath for you.

143
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:50,406
You hear that?

144
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:52,408
Mm-hmm.

145
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,643
And I turned to my buddies
and I said...

146
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:56,812
"I will not leave
France without her."

147
00:11:56,813 --> 00:11:58,147
And I didn't.

148
00:11:58,148 --> 00:11:59,782
You didn't.

149
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:01,650
I didn't.

150
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:04,887
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit, the rug!

151
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:05,888
Aw, Mom...

152
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:07,023
I can't believe I did that.

153
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:08,524
No, no, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

154
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:10,059
Oh, Frankie, Frankie,
get a towel.

155
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
Paula...
Yeah, yeah.

156
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:12,061
Come on.

157
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,100
Dance with me, Paula.

158
00:12:20,003 --> 00:12:22,838
Ah...

159
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:30,546
Whenever I dance for you

160
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:32,648
I get in trouble.

161
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:40,589
Watch this.

162
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:45,794
Oh!

163
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:46,795
Frank! Wake up.

164
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:48,364
Come on, let's go!

165
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:50,433
Get up.
Come on, come on.

166
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:51,633
Frank, wake up.

167
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:52,868
Dad...

168
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:54,736
You don't have to go
to school today.

169
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,172
It's okay.

170
00:12:56,173 --> 00:12:57,706
Why? Is it snowing?

171
00:12:57,707 --> 00:12:59,175
Do you have a black suit?

172
00:12:59,176 --> 00:13:01,010
I overslept again, huh?

173
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:04,580
We have a very important
meeting in the city.

174
00:13:04,581 --> 00:13:06,482
Eat that.
Come on, come on, eat.

175
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:08,117
Ma'am, open up.
Just open up, please!

176
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:09,118
Ma'am?
It's important.

177
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,286
What?

178
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:11,887
Oh, gosh!

179
00:13:11,888 --> 00:13:13,222
We don't open for half an hour!

180
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:15,091
Open the door, please.
Just open the door.

181
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:16,092
It's important.

182
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:18,060
I-I'm sorry, we don't open
for half an hour.

183
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:19,161
What's your name, ma'am?

184
00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:20,363
Darcy.

185
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:21,497
Darcy.
That's a pretty name.

186
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:23,265
I'm in a bit of a fix.
I need a suit for my kid.

187
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:24,266
This is my son Frank.

188
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:25,267
Oh, hi.

189
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:26,268
He needs a black suit.

190
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:27,669
Black suit...

191
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,038
There was a death
in the family.

192
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,539
My father, 85 years old,
war hero.

193
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,541
Yeah?

194
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,344
There's a funeral
this afternoon, military funeral

195
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:37,513
planes flying overhead,
21-gun salute.

196
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:38,847
Geez.

197
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:40,816
Frank needs to borrow a suit

198
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:42,018
for a couple of hours.

199
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:44,953
I'm sorry, we don't loan suits,
and we're not open.

200
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:46,322
Darcy... Darcy, please.

201
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:48,224
Come back.

202
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:50,359
Darcy... is this yours?

203
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:58,767
I just found it
in the parking lot.

204
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:00,936
Uh-huh.

205
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:03,505
It must've slipped
right off your neck.

206
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:08,344
Don't hit the curb.

207
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,051
Now get out,
walk around the back

208
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:16,985
and hold the door open for me.

209
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:27,563
All right.

210
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:28,797
What's next?

211
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:30,199
Okay, stop grinning.

212
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,635
When I get inside, you go back
to the front seat and wait.

213
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:36,172
Even if a cop comes
and writes you a ticket

214
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:38,240
you don't move the car,
understood?

215
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:40,176
Dad, wha-what's
all this for?

216
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:42,278
You know why the Yankees
always win, Frank?

217
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,946
'Cause they have Mickey Mantle?

218
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:45,647
No, it's 'cause the other teams

219
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:48,117
can't stop staring
at those damn pinstripes.

220
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:49,151
Watch this.

221
00:14:49,152 --> 00:14:51,053
The manager
of Chase Manhattan Bank

222
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:55,658
is about to open the
door for your father.

223
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:59,562
Mr. Abagnale, um

224
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,663
we don't usually
loan money to people

225
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:04,066
who have unresolved business
with the IRS.

226
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,934
That's a misunderstanding.

227
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:07,703
I hired the wrong
guy to do my books.

228
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:09,505
A mistake, I...
anybody could make it.

229
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:11,873
I just need you guys to
help me weather the storm.

230
00:15:11,874 --> 00:15:14,210
Sir, you're being investigated
by the government

231
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:16,212
for tax fraud.

232
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:18,347
My store is a landmark
in New Rochelle.

233
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:20,282
I have customers
all over New York.

234
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:22,918
Well, you're not a customer
at Chase Manhattan.

235
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,019
We don't know you.

236
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,821
I'm sure your bank
in New Rochelle

237
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:27,923
they know you,
they could help you out.

238
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:29,492
My bank went out of business.

239
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,927
Banks like this one put
them out of business.

240
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:34,096
Now, I know I made a
mistake, I admit that

241
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:35,598
but these people want blood.

242
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,599
They want my store.

243
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,534
They've threatened
to put me in jail.

244
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,737
This is America, right?

245
00:15:41,738 --> 00:15:42,804
I'm not a criminal.

246
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:44,340
I'm a Medal of Honor winner

247
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:47,143
a lifetime member
of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.

248
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:50,112
All I'm asking is for you
to help me beat these guys.

249
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:52,681
It's not a question
of winning and losing.

250
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:54,216
It's a question of risk.

251
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:56,918
You're the largest
bank in the world.

252
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,554
Where's the fu...

253
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:01,457
Whe... Where's the risk?

254
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:09,431
Dad, how could you just let him
take our car like that?

255
00:16:09,432 --> 00:16:11,467
He didn't take anything.
We took him.

256
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:12,635
He overpaid by $500.

257
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:15,904
Come on, Frank.

258
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:17,373
Let's return the suit.

259
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:26,715
This place is good.

260
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:28,684
It's small but, you know

261
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:31,253
it's going to be
a lot less work.

262
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:32,854
A lot less work for you.

263
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:57,313
FRANK:
Hey, Dad.

264
00:16:57,314 --> 00:16:59,515
Hi.

265
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:04,953
Where's your mother?

266
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:06,121
I don't know.

267
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:10,759
She said something
about going to look for a job.

268
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:13,061
What's she gonna be

269
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:14,996
a shoe salesman
at a centipede farm?

270
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:22,638
What are you doing?

271
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,475
You want some pancakes?

272
00:17:26,476 --> 00:17:27,476
For dinner?

273
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:29,378
On my son's 16th birthday?

274
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:31,713
We're not gonna eat pancakes.

275
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,719
Come on, why are you
looking at me like that?

276
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,986
You thought I forgot?

277
00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:41,022
I didn't think you forgot.
I opened a checking account

278
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:42,858
in your name.

279
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:44,226
I put $25 in the account

280
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:46,061
so you can buy
whatever you want.

281
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:47,396
Don't tell your mother.

282
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:48,497
I won't.

283
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:49,698
Thanks, Dad.

284
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:50,733
Yep.

285
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:54,069
Didn't that bank turn you down
for a loan, though?

286
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,504
Yes, they all turned me down.

287
00:17:56,906 --> 00:17:59,174
Then why you opening a
banking account with them?

288
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:01,477
Well, because one day,
you'll want something

289
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:03,379
from these people...
a house, a car.

290
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,582
They have all the money.

291
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:12,053
There's 50 checks there, Frank

292
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:16,692
which means, from
this day on...

293
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:18,894
you're in their little club.

294
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:22,364
I'm in their little club.

295
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:24,500
You got that, you got it all.

296
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:28,904
It's even got
my name there, huh?

297
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:30,238
To the moon.

298
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,274
To the moon!

299
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:35,243
To the moon.

300
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:46,455
See that?
It's just a school.

301
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:48,223
No different than Westbourne.

302
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:52,227
Ma... you said you were
going to quit.

303
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:58,734
Frankie, you don't have
to wear the uniform here.

304
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:01,704
Why don't you take
off your jacket?

305
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:04,740
I'm used to it.

306
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:10,245
Excuse me.

307
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:11,246
Oh, yes?

308
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:13,148
Do you know where
room 17 French is?

309
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:14,916
GIRL:
Yeah, it's...

310
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:25,093
BOY:
But you frickin' killed him.

311
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:30,766
You selling encyclopedias?

312
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:34,436
Yeah, he looks like
a substitute teacher.

313
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:51,219
Quiet down, people!

314
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,522
My name is Mr. Abagnale!

315
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:56,759
That's Abagnale, not Abagnahlee

316
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,195
not Abagnaylee, but Abagnale!

317
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:02,431
Now, somebody please
tell me where you left off

318
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:04,633
in your textbooks.

319
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:07,636
Excuse me, people,
if I need to ask again

320
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:09,304
I'm going to write up
the entire class.

321
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:11,840
Take your seats!

322
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:17,412
Chapter seven.

323
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:19,848
Will you please open your
textbooks to, uh, chapter eight

324
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:22,484
and we'll get started?

325
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:23,986
Excuse me, what's your name?

326
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:25,020
Brad.

327
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:26,589
Brad, why don't you get up here

328
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,457
in front of the class here

329
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,827
and read conversation
number five?

330
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:37,165
<i>"Les Francais sonts</i>

331
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,167
<i>"uh, generalement</i>

332
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:42,004
<i>"dans leur pais que...</i>

333
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:44,907
<i>presque tout le monde</i>
<i>a cette impression..."</i>

334
00:20:44,908 --> 00:20:46,308
They sent for me.

335
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:49,544
They said they needed
a sub for Roberta.

336
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:52,380
I came all the way
from-from Dixon.

337
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:54,583
Well, uh,
I always sub for Roberta.

338
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:56,719
Excuse me,
why aren't you reading?

339
00:20:57,954 --> 00:21:00,689
I'll never come back to-to
Bellarmine Jefferson again!

340
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,291
You tell them not to call me!

341
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:05,728
What do they think,
it's easy for a woman my age

342
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:07,863
and all the money that it costs
to travel?

343
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:09,665
I tell you,
they don't give a damn.

344
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:12,501
Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale

345
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:15,804
this is not a question
of your son's attendance.

346
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:18,974
I regret to inform you that,
for the past week

347
00:21:18,975 --> 00:21:22,777
Frank has been teaching
Mrs. Glasser's French class.

348
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:25,247
He what?

349
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:29,384
Your son has been pretending
to be a substitute teacher

350
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:33,756
lecturing the students,
uh, giving out homework.

351
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:37,292
Mrs. Glasser has
been ill and there was

352
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:40,295
some confusion
with the real sub.

353
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:43,832
Your son held a teacher-parent
conference yesterday

354
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,268
and was planning
a class field trip

355
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,837
to a French bread factory
in Trenton.

356
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:52,440
Do you see the problem we have?

357
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:54,442
Yeah.
Mrs. Davenport?

358
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,945
Uh, I have a note to miss
fifth and sixth period today.

359
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:57,980
Doctor's appointment.

360
00:21:57,981 --> 00:22:00,115
One moment.

361
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:01,416
I'll be right with you.

362
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:02,417
Hey...

363
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:03,418
MRS. DAVENPORT:
Yes?

364
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:04,653
You should fold it.

365
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:05,754
What?

366
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:07,422
That note.
It's a fake, right?

367
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:08,757
You should fold it.

368
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:10,559
It's... It's a note
from my mom.

369
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,294
I have a doctor's appointment.

370
00:22:12,295 --> 00:22:15,197
Yeah, but there's
no crease in the paper.

371
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:17,265
When your mom hands
you a note to miss school

372
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:19,034
the first thing you do is,
you fold it

373
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:20,435
and you put it in your pocket.

374
00:22:20,436 --> 00:22:23,805
I mean, if it's real,
where's the crease?

375
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:34,883
Frankie.

376
00:22:50,266 --> 00:22:52,267
Ma, I'm home.

377
00:22:54,337 --> 00:22:56,338
Oh, you remember
that girl Joanna

378
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:58,540
I was telling you about?

379
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:00,676
I asked her out today.

380
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:04,046
Think we're going to go
to the Junior Prom.

381
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:07,916
Ma, is this
my driver's license?

382
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,718
That's all there is,
two bedrooms.

383
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:12,121
Oh, Frankie.

384
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:14,089
You remember Dad's friend?

385
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,024
Jack Barnes?

386
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:17,325
From the club.

387
00:23:17,326 --> 00:23:18,360
Hello.

388
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:20,328
He came by looking
for your father.

389
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:23,098
I was giving him
a tour of the apartment.

390
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:26,335
It's very, uh, uh,
spacious, Paula.

391
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:33,976
Dad's at the store.

392
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:37,012
So, Frank... you're
getting to look

393
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:40,082
more like your
old man every day.

394
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:44,953
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.

395
00:23:44,954 --> 00:23:46,755
I'll see you later, eh?

396
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:48,957
Wait.

397
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:55,063
Is this yours?

398
00:23:55,064 --> 00:23:57,800
Oh.

399
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,501
Well, thanks, Frank.

400
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:01,870
Uh, that's the President's pin.

401
00:24:01,871 --> 00:24:04,506
I'd be in deep trouble
if I lost that.

402
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:12,680
I'll see you all later, eh?

403
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:24,193
Are you hungry, Frankie?

404
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:26,794
I'll make you a sandwich.

405
00:24:34,737 --> 00:24:37,772
Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.

406
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:39,908
He thinks we should
get a lawyer

407
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:42,077
and sue the government.

408
00:24:43,412 --> 00:24:46,548
That is not legal,
what they're doing to us.

409
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:51,686
Why aren't you saying anything?

410
00:24:57,894 --> 00:25:02,564
You're not going
to tell him... are you?

411
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:04,333
No.

412
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:05,633
That's right.

413
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:08,370
There's nothing to tell.

414
00:25:08,371 --> 00:25:10,038
I'm going out for a few hours

415
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:13,208
to visit some old friends
from the tennis club and...

416
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:16,845
when I get home, we'll all
have dinner together.

417
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:18,847
Right?

418
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,916
But you won't say anything

419
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:24,353
because it's...
it's just silly, isn't it?

420
00:25:24,354 --> 00:25:26,555
How could we sue anybody?

421
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:34,796
Oh... do you need
some money, Frankie?

422
00:25:34,797 --> 00:25:38,633
A few dollars to buy
some record albums?

423
00:25:38,634 --> 00:25:41,803
Here, take five dollars.

424
00:25:41,804 --> 00:25:44,005
Or-Or ten.

425
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:51,346
You promised you
were going to quit.

426
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:13,034
Ma, I'm home!

427
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:29,284
Hey, hey!

428
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:30,652
You... You stay away from me,
hear me?

429
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:32,421
You stay away from me...
I don't know who you are

430
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:33,688
but if you ever
come back here again...

431
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:35,958
Frankie! Frank, Frank,
calm down, will you?

432
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,225
I'm Dick Kesner.

433
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:39,428
Now, I want you
to leave your things here

434
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:41,496
and follow me
into the next room, okay?

435
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:43,265
They're all waiting for you.

436
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:48,370
PAULA:
You don't have to be scared.

437
00:26:48,371 --> 00:26:50,405
I'm right here, Frank.
I'll always be here.

438
00:26:50,406 --> 00:26:52,140
But there are laws.

439
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:54,376
Everything in this
country has to be legal.

440
00:26:54,377 --> 00:26:57,412
So what we need to do
is make some decisions.

441
00:26:57,413 --> 00:26:59,081
That's what Mr. Kesner
is here for.

442
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:01,450
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts

443
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:02,917
but that can be
very expensive, Frank

444
00:27:02,918 --> 00:27:04,586
people fighting
over their children.

445
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:06,288
Nobody is fighting.

446
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:08,957
Look at me, Frank.
Nobody is fighting.

447
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:13,628
Dad, what's going on?

448
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:15,197
Dad, what's going on?

449
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,467
Do you remember
your grandma, Eve?

450
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:21,203
She arrived this morning.

451
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:24,372
Hello.

452
00:27:32,514 --> 00:27:35,917
Do you understand what
we're saying to you, Frank?

453
00:27:37,353 --> 00:27:41,356
Your father and I
are getting a divorce.

454
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:45,126
Nothing's gonna change.

455
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:46,862
We're still gonna
see each other.

456
00:27:46,863 --> 00:27:48,796
Stop it, please, Frank.
Don't interrupt.

457
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:51,166
Frank, you don't
have to read all of this.

458
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:54,336
Most of it's for your parents...
boring adult business...

459
00:27:54,337 --> 00:27:57,105
but this paragraph right here,
this is important

460
00:27:57,106 --> 00:27:59,807
because it states
who you're gonna live with...

461
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,809
after the divorce...

462
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,778
whose custody you will be in.

463
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,948
And there's a blank space
right here.

464
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,417
And I want you to go
into the kitchen

465
00:28:09,418 --> 00:28:11,019
sit at the table

466
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,720
and put a name down.

467
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:14,055
You can take
as long as you want

468
00:28:14,056 --> 00:28:15,757
but when you come back
into this room...

469
00:28:15,758 --> 00:28:18,393
<i>I want to see a name</i>
<i>on that line.</i>

470
00:28:18,394 --> 00:28:22,163
Frank, just write down a name
and this will all be over.

471
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:24,065
It's gonna be okay.

472
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:25,867
FRANK:
<i>Dad, what name?</i>

473
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:27,035
Your mother or your father.

474
00:28:27,036 --> 00:28:29,237
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.

475
00:28:29,238 --> 00:28:32,274
And don't look so scared.

476
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:34,042
It's not a test.

477
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:36,244
<i>There's no wrong answer.</i>

478
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:49,891
Hi.

479
00:28:51,027 --> 00:28:52,593
One ticket to Grand
Central, please.

480
00:28:52,594 --> 00:28:55,863
That'll be $3.50, sir.

481
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:58,899
Is it okay
if I write you a check?

482
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:06,607
Carl, when do I get
to call my father?

483
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:09,177
You can call him when
we get to New York.

484
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:12,480
We leave for the airport
in seven hours.

485
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:14,749
Until then, just sit there.

486
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,518
Be quiet.

487
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,887
You know, Carl,
on the other side of the hotel

488
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:21,922
they got suites
that face the park.

489
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:26,194
It's the best room
the FBI can afford.

490
00:29:28,364 --> 00:29:30,465
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.

491
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:31,833
<i>Mr. Mudrick...</i>

492
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:33,168
Mr. Mudrick, please.
You have to listen.

493
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:34,970
I don't want to
hear your story.

494
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:36,704
This is two checks
that bounced.

495
00:29:36,705 --> 00:29:38,539
You know how much
trouble I'm in?

496
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,141
No, but listen, I'm telling you

497
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:41,476
the bank,
they made the mistake.

498
00:29:41,477 --> 00:29:43,011
I'll write you
another check right now!

499
00:29:43,012 --> 00:29:44,980
What, do I look like
I was born yesterday?

500
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:46,848
Look, it's midnight,
Mr. Mudrick.

501
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:47,849
Where am I gonna go?

502
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,484
You're a goddamn kid.

503
00:29:49,485 --> 00:29:51,686
Go home.

504
00:30:39,118 --> 00:30:40,418
I mean, I hope you understand.

505
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:42,253
My boss sent me to Brooklyn,
then Queens.

506
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:43,688
Now he wants me in Long Island

507
00:30:43,689 --> 00:30:46,191
to take a few clients out
for a night on the town.

508
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:47,992
I'm sorry,
but we're not allowed

509
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:49,794
to cash checks
from other banks.

510
00:30:49,795 --> 00:30:52,063
How would we know
if they were any good?

511
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:53,798
What did you say your name was?

512
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:54,799
Ashley.

513
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,100
Ashley...

514
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:58,302
you know what I found on
the sidewalk out there?

515
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:05,943
Must've slipped
right off your neck.

516
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:13,918
Is there something
I can help you with, son?

517
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,354
Well, you see, it's my
grandmother's birthday next week

518
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:18,389
and I want to get her
something extra-special.

519
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,091
<i>Please, I mean</i>

520
00:31:20,092 --> 00:31:22,560
it's my midterm next week
and my books were stolen.

521
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:25,596
Please, it's just five dollars.

522
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:27,232
No one would have to know.

523
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:29,868
I'm sorry,
but we are not allowed

524
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:33,404
to take checks
from people we don't know.

525
00:32:14,947 --> 00:32:16,847
Pleasure to have you back,
Captain Carlson.

526
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:18,283
What do you think, Angelo?

527
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:19,918
The tomatoes are ripe
this afternoon.

528
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:29,027
Well, what have we here?

529
00:32:29,028 --> 00:32:31,062
Can I have your autograph?
You betcha.

530
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:33,097
Can I have your autograph, too?
You gonna be a pilot?

531
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:35,266
Mm-hmm!
All right, then.

532
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,801
There you go.
Work hard in school.

533
00:32:36,802 --> 00:32:38,169
FRANK:
<i>Dear Dad:</i>

534
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,771
<i>I have decided to become</i>
<i>an airline pilot.</i>

535
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:43,141
<i>I have applied</i>
<i>to all the big airlines</i>

536
00:32:43,142 --> 00:32:46,244
<i>and I have several</i>
<i>promising interviews lined up.</i>

537
00:32:46,245 --> 00:32:48,012
<i>How's Mom?</i>

538
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:50,014
<i>Have you called her lately?</i>

539
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:52,283
<i>Love, your son, Frank.</i>

540
00:32:55,454 --> 00:32:57,288
Hello.

541
00:32:57,289 --> 00:32:59,657
I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School

542
00:32:59,658 --> 00:33:02,260
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Morgan.

543
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:03,561
You're the young man

544
00:33:03,562 --> 00:33:05,496
who's writing the article
for the school paper.

545
00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:06,998
Yes, ma'am, that's me.
I want to know

546
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:09,000
everything there is to know
about being a pilot.

547
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:10,701
What airports
does Pan Am fly to?

548
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:12,403
What does a pilot
make in a year?

549
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:14,772
And who tells them where
they're gonna fly to?

550
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:15,974
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

551
00:33:15,975 --> 00:33:17,208
Just take 'em one at a time.

552
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:18,376
All right.
What does it mean

553
00:33:18,377 --> 00:33:19,978
when one pilot says
to another pilot:

554
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:21,545
"What kind of equipment
are you on?"

555
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:24,082
They just want to know what
kind of aircraft you're flying:

556
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:25,516
Is it a DC-8, 707,
Constellation?

557
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:28,186
And what about those I.D. badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

558
00:33:28,187 --> 00:33:30,989
Well, every pilot has to have two
things with him at all times:

559
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,623
One is his airline
personnel badge...

560
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:34,625
looks just like this
one here, from Pan Am...

561
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:37,261
the other one is
their FAA license...

562
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:39,630
and that looks just like this.

563
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:41,765
Oh. Sir, do you
think I can

564
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:45,236
make a copy of this
to put into my article?

565
00:33:45,237 --> 00:33:47,038
Oh, Frank, you can
have that one.

566
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,439
It's three years expired.

567
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,041
Aw, thanks!
And what about your I.D. badge?

568
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:51,575
You have an extra
one I could borrow?

569
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:53,577
Oh, no, I can't help you there.

570
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:55,546
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.

571
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:57,048
The only way
to get one of those

572
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:59,717
is to become a real live pilot
for Pan American Airways.

573
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,124
WOMAN:
Pan Am, may I help you?

574
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:07,591
FRANK:
Yeah, hello.

575
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:08,659
I'm calling about a uniform.

576
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,428
Hold for Purchasing.

577
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,429
Thank you.

578
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,796
WOMAN 2:
Purchasing.

579
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,798
Hi. I'm a copilot

580
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:16,100
based out of San Francisco.

581
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:18,002
I flew a flight
into New York last night

582
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:19,037
but the problem is

583
00:34:19,038 --> 00:34:20,671
I'm headed out to, uh, Paris
in three hours.

584
00:34:20,672 --> 00:34:22,540
How can we help you?

585
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:25,609
I sent my uniform to be cleaned
through the hotel

586
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,146
and I... I guess
they must have lost it.

587
00:34:28,147 --> 00:34:30,681
WOMAN 2: <i>They lost a uniform.
Happens all the time.</i>

588
00:34:30,682 --> 00:34:32,716
<i>Go down to the Well-Built</i>
<i>Uniform Company</i>

589
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:33,817
<i>at Ninth and Broadway.</i>

590
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:35,286
<i>They're our uniform supplier.</i>

591
00:34:35,287 --> 00:34:36,987
<i>I'll tell Mr. Rosen</i>
<i>you're coming.</i>

592
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:39,223
ROSEN: You look too
young to be a pilot.

593
00:34:39,224 --> 00:34:40,991
I'm a copilot.

594
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:42,660
Why so nervous?

595
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:44,495
How would you feel if you, uh

596
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:47,098
lost your uniform
first week on the job?

597
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:48,732
Relax.

598
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:51,302
Pan Am's got lots of uniforms.

599
00:34:51,303 --> 00:34:53,604
It's gonna be $164.

600
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:55,940
Great. I'll, uh,
I'll write you a check.

601
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:58,042
Sorry, no checks, no cash.

602
00:34:58,043 --> 00:35:00,211
You'll have to fill in
your employee I.D. number

603
00:35:00,212 --> 00:35:01,345
and then I'll bill Pan Am.

604
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:03,481
They'll take it out
of your next paycheck.

605
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:07,351
Even better.

606
00:35:09,121 --> 00:35:11,122
FRANK:
<i>Dear Dad:</i>

607
00:35:11,123 --> 00:35:14,058
<i>You always told me that an</i>
<i>honest man has nothing to fear.</i>

608
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:16,094
<i>So I'm trying my best</i>
<i>not to be afraid.</i>

609
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:20,631
<i>I'm sorry I ran away,</i>
<i>but you don't have to worry.</i>

610
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:22,766
<i>I'm gonna get it all back</i>
<i>now, Daddy.</i>

611
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:25,136
<i>I promise.</i>
<i>I'm going to get it all back.</i>

612
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,943
GIRL:
Are you a real live pilot?

613
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:35,113
I sure am, little lady.
What's your name?

614
00:35:35,114 --> 00:35:36,114
Celine.

615
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:38,048
Celine, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

616
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:40,318
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

617
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:46,524
That's fifty, seventy

618
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:50,461
eighty, ninety,
one hundred dollars.

619
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:52,396
You have yourself a
great time in Paris.

620
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:54,031
I always do.

621
00:35:54,032 --> 00:35:57,018
Excuse me.

622
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:58,720
I'm John Modiger.
I manage this branch.

623
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:00,154
I want to thank you
for coming in

624
00:36:00,155 --> 00:36:01,288
and using our institution.

625
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:03,057
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, John.

626
00:36:03,058 --> 00:36:04,058
I'll be back again.

627
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:05,326
Good.

628
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:06,961
Have you stayed with us before?

629
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:10,331
Uh, no, I've been primarily
based on the West Coast.

630
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:13,735
Is it all right if I write
you a check for the room?

631
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:14,836
No problem, sir.

632
00:36:14,837 --> 00:36:17,038
Great.

633
00:36:24,296 --> 00:36:25,346
Uh...

634
00:36:25,347 --> 00:36:26,414
I was also wondering

635
00:36:26,415 --> 00:36:28,315
if I could write you
a personal check?

636
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:31,819
For airline personnel, we cash
personal checks up to $100.

637
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,021
Payroll checks
we cash up to $300.

638
00:36:35,223 --> 00:36:38,026
Did you say $300
for a payroll check?

639

649
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:46,494
Fine, thank you.

650
00:37:46,495 --> 00:37:48,496
I have a payroll check here
I'd like to cash.

651
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:50,164
Certainly.

Uh, excuse me.

I'm sure you hear this
all the time

655
00:37:56,204 --> 00:37:58,706
but you have the most
beautiful eyes I have ever seen.

656
00:38:00,242 --> 00:38:01,776
Yeah, I do get
that all the time.

657
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:05,612
How would you like it?

658
00:38:20,295 --> 00:38:21,663
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

659
00:38:21,664 --> 00:38:25,599
We won't have any cash until
the banks open in an hour

660
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,868
but, uh, I'm sure

661
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:29,603
they can cash your
check at the airport.

662
00:38:29,604 --> 00:38:31,139
The airport?

663
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,541
Who cashes checks
at the airport?

664
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:34,608
Well, the airlines, sir.

665
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:37,111
They've always taken
care of their own.

666
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:46,688
Hello.

667
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:48,355
Hi. Are you deadheading?

668
00:38:48,356 --> 00:38:50,124
What?

669
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:52,126
Are you my deadhead to Miami?

Mi...?

671

Yes, yes.

672
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:59,466
Yeah, I'm the deadhead.
Here you go.

673
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:03,237
You're a little late,
but the jump seat is open.

674
00:39:04,707 --> 00:39:05,707
You know

675
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,408
it's been awhile
since I've done this.

676
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:08,810
Which one's the
jump seat again?

677
00:39:11,313 --> 00:39:12,980
Have a nice flight.

678
00:39:12,981 --> 00:39:15,416

Thanks for giving me
a lift, boys.

684

Go ahead and take
a seat, Frank.

685
00:39:27,096 --> 00:39:28,262
We're about to push.

686
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:30,564
What kind of
equipment you on, DC-8?

687
00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:32,266
Uh, 707.

688
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:35,002
You turning around
on the redeye?

689
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:37,138
Uh, I'm jumping puddles
for the next few months

690
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:39,006
trying to earn my keep
running leapfrogs

691
00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:40,208
for the weak and weary.

692
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:43,444
No shame in that.
We all did it.

693
00:39:49,752 --> 00:39:50,785
Have a seat.

694
00:39:50,786 --> 00:39:52,086
Thank you.

695
00:39:52,888 --> 00:39:55,256
Would you like a drink
after takeoff?

696
00:39:55,257 --> 00:39:57,158
M-Milk?

697
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,359
OLIVER:
80 knots.

698

699

V-one. Rotate.

<i>they tell me</i>
<i>my family can fly for free.</i>

708
00:40:20,482 --> 00:40:23,818
<i>So tell Mom to pack her bags</i>
<i>and buy a new swimsuit</i>

709
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:27,088
<i>because I'm taking us all</i>
<i>to Hawaii for Christmas.</i>

710
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:28,455
<i>I love you, Dad.</i>

711
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:30,524
<i>Aloha, Frank.</i>

712
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:32,160
Hello, deadhead.

713
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:33,161
Hello.

714
00:40:33,162 --> 00:40:34,996
Enjoying your free ride?

715
00:40:40,702 --> 00:40:43,370
Marci...

716
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:45,572
did you drop this?

717
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:49,811
Must've slipped
right off your neck.

718
00:40:49,812 --> 00:40:51,179
No...

719
00:40:52,848 --> 00:40:54,882
No!

720
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:56,583
No...

721
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:59,287
MARCI:
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

722
00:41:01,857 --> 00:41:03,057
Yes!

723
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:10,064
Why are you stopping?

724
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:13,500
I want to tell you
something, Marci.

725
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:17,305
This is by far...

726
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:21,943
the best date I
have ever been on.

727
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:43,697
WOMAN: I'd like to open
a Money Market, please.

728
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:45,899
Okay.

729
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:55,676
Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.
How may I help you?

730
00:41:55,677 --> 00:41:59,080
My name is Frank Taylor.
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.

731
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:01,949
I'd like to cash this check
here, and then

732
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:05,152
I'd like to take you out
for a steak dinner.

733
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,231
And then we feed the checks
into the MICR machine

734
00:42:17,232 --> 00:42:18,532
which uses special ink

735
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:19,767
to encode the account numbers

736
00:42:19,768 --> 00:42:21,202
on the bottom of the checks.

737
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:25,439
And where are these numbers?

738
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,708
They're, um...
right here.

739
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:29,076
Right there?

740
00:42:29,077 --> 00:42:30,244
See?

741
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:34,715
They're called routing numbers.

742
00:42:34,716 --> 00:42:37,118
So where do the checks
get routed to?

743
00:42:37,953 --> 00:42:40,321
You know, I don't exactly know.

744
00:42:40,322 --> 00:42:41,889
Nobody ever asked
me that before.

745
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:45,293
AUCTIONEER:
Our next item up for bid

746
00:42:45,294 --> 00:42:47,628
is also from the Jersey
Central Bank foreclosure.

747
00:42:47,629 --> 00:42:48,829
This is a MICR encoder

748
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,531
a machine used
to encode bank checks.

749
00:42:50,532 --> 00:42:51,832
Do I have an opening bid?

750
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:53,867
HANRATTY: <i>Our unknown
subject is a paperhanger</i>

751
00:42:53,868 --> 00:42:55,636
<i>who started working</i>
<i>on the East Coast.</i>

752
00:42:55,637 --> 00:42:57,805
<i>In the last few weeks,</i>
<i>this unsub has developed</i>

753
00:42:57,806 --> 00:43:00,374
<i>a new form of check fraud</i>
<i>which I'm calling "the float."</i>

754
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,475
What he's doing is

755
00:43:01,476 --> 00:43:03,544
he's opening checking accounts
at various banks

756
00:43:03,545 --> 00:43:05,413
then changing the MICR ink
routing numbers

757
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:06,780
at the bottom of those checks.

758
00:43:06,781 --> 00:43:07,982
Next slide, please.

759
00:43:09,251 --> 00:43:11,218
Next slide, please.

760
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:12,719
Uh, the remote thing is broken.

761
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,155
You'll have to do it by hand.

762
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:15,423
You've gotta...
try the...

763
00:43:15,424 --> 00:43:16,824
Agent Mullen, it should be...

764
00:43:16,825 --> 00:43:19,526
it should be the square button
just there by the side.

765
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:20,727
This carousel doesn't work.

766
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:22,229
It's a bad carousel
you got there.

767
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,297
Thank you, Agent Mullen.

768
00:43:23,298 --> 00:43:24,531
Got to move it manually.

769
00:43:24,532 --> 00:43:27,068
This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

770
00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:29,070
Slide.

771
00:43:30,205 --> 00:43:31,672
MICR scanners at every bank

772
00:43:31,673 --> 00:43:34,141
read these numbers
at the bottom of a check...

773
00:43:34,142 --> 00:43:35,409
slide...

774
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,712
and then, ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.

775
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:41,482
Carl, for those of us who are
unfamiliar with bank fraud

776
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:43,784
you mind telling us
what the hell

777
00:43:43,785 --> 00:43:45,286
you're talking about?

778
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:49,256
The East Coast branches are
numbered zero-one to zero-six.

779
00:43:49,257 --> 00:43:51,325
The central branch
is zero-seven, zero-eight

780
00:43:51,326 --> 00:43:52,460
so on, so forth.

781
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:54,095
You mean those numbers
on the bottom of a check

782
00:43:54,096 --> 00:43:55,096
actually mean something?

783
00:43:55,097 --> 00:43:56,097
All of this was in the report

784
00:43:56,098 --> 00:43:57,631
I filed two days ago.

785
00:43:57,632 --> 00:44:01,835
If you change...
a zero-two to a one-two

786
00:44:01,836 --> 00:44:04,705
that means that check,
which was cashed in New York

787
00:44:04,706 --> 00:44:06,374
does not go to the New York
Federal Branch

788
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:07,608
but it is rerouted

789
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:10,911
all the way to the San Francisco
Federal Branch.

790
00:44:10,912 --> 00:44:13,780
The bank doesn't even know the
check has bounced for two weeks

791
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:15,782
which means our unsub
can stay in one place

792
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:17,485
paper the same city
over and over again

793
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:19,320
while his checks
circle the country.

794
00:44:19,321 --> 00:44:22,423
You know, you want
to talk to my wife.

795
00:44:22,424 --> 00:44:25,092
She's the one balances
the checkbook at our house.

796
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:32,132
Next slide.

797
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:39,139
Daddy!

798
00:44:41,943 --> 00:44:43,944
My son, the birdman.

799
00:44:43,945 --> 00:44:44,979
Some uniform, Frank.

800
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,981
What do you think?

801
00:44:46,982 --> 00:44:48,648
Nice.

802
00:44:48,649 --> 00:44:50,317
Sit down.

803
00:44:53,321 --> 00:44:55,489
So, Dad... Daddy, have you
gotten the postcards?

804
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:56,823
Of course.

805
00:44:56,824 --> 00:44:59,126
This fork is ice cold.

806
00:44:59,127 --> 00:45:02,796
No, no, Dad, th-that's
a chilled salad fork.

807
00:45:02,797 --> 00:45:07,467
It's a fancy restaurant, you know.

808
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:13,274
Well, here...

809
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:15,209
I-I got you something.

810
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,944
What's that?

811
00:45:16,945 --> 00:45:19,146
Open it.

812
00:45:22,951 --> 00:45:24,785
You know what those are, right?

813
00:45:24,786 --> 00:45:26,787
Those are the keys

814
00:45:26,788 --> 00:45:29,790
to a 1965 Cadillac
DeVille convertible.

815
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:31,692
Brand-new, Dad.

816
00:45:31,693 --> 00:45:34,629
Red with white interior

817
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:38,799
split seats,
air conditioning, the works.

818
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,067
Are you giving me a Cadillac?

819
00:45:40,068 --> 00:45:41,802
Yeah. I'm giving you
a Cadillac.

820
00:45:41,803 --> 00:45:43,571
Dad, sh-she's parked
downstairs.

821
00:45:43,572 --> 00:45:45,139
When we're done eating lunch

822
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:48,041
why don't you, you know,
drive on over to Mom's house

823
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:50,210
pick her up,
take a little joyride?

824
00:45:50,211 --> 00:45:52,012
Do you know what would happen

825
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:53,314
if the IRS found out

826
00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:56,817
I was driving around
in a new coupe?

827
00:45:56,818 --> 00:45:59,119
I took the train here, Frank.

828
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,489
I'm taking the train home.

829
00:46:03,158 --> 00:46:05,192
All right.

830
00:46:10,198 --> 00:46:13,301
I have plenty of money.

831
00:46:13,302 --> 00:46:15,703
You know, if you
ever, ever need anything...

832
00:46:15,704 --> 00:46:17,037
You worried?

833
00:46:17,038 --> 00:46:19,573
About me?

834
00:46:19,574 --> 00:46:21,208
No, I'm not...
I'm not worried.

835
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:23,645
You think I can't
buy my own car?

836
00:46:23,646 --> 00:46:28,215
Two mice fell in a
bucket of cream, Frank.

837
00:46:28,216 --> 00:46:30,083
Which one am I?

838
00:46:30,084 --> 00:46:32,953
You're that second mouse.

839
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:38,225
I went by the store today.

840
00:46:38,226 --> 00:46:40,194
I had to close the
store for awhile.

841
00:46:40,195 --> 00:46:41,762
It's all about timing, Frank.

842
00:46:41,763 --> 00:46:43,364
The goddamn government
knows that.

843
00:46:43,365 --> 00:46:44,965
They hit you when you're down.

844
00:46:44,966 --> 00:46:46,334
I wasn't going to let them

845
00:46:46,335 --> 00:46:47,901
take it from me, so I just...

846
00:46:47,902 --> 00:46:51,005
shut the doors myself,
called their bluff.

847
00:46:55,577 --> 00:46:57,745
Sooner or later,
they'll forget about me.

848
00:46:57,746 --> 00:47:00,180
I understand, I...

849
00:47:00,181 --> 00:47:03,584
Have you told Ma?

850
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:09,790
She's so stubborn, your mother.

851
00:47:12,427 --> 00:47:13,761
Don't worry.

852
00:47:13,762 --> 00:47:16,129
I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

853
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:17,365
I been fighting for us...

854
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:21,802
Dad?

855
00:47:23,938 --> 00:47:26,540
since the day we... we met.

856
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:28,409
Daddy, out of all those men

857
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:31,879
you were the one that
took her home, remember that.

858
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,315
200 men, sitting in
that tiny social hall

859
00:47:35,316 --> 00:47:37,517
watching her dance.

860
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:42,289
What was the name of that town?

861
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,624
Montrichard, Dad.

862
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,125
Yeah.

863
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:47,961
I didn't speak a word of French

864
00:47:47,962 --> 00:47:51,432
and six weeks later,
she was my wi...

865
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:54,435
She's your wife.

866
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:58,706
My son bought me
a Cadillac today.

867
00:47:58,707 --> 00:48:02,743
I think that calls for a toast.

868
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:13,654
To the best damn pilot
in the sky.

869
00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:15,355
It's not what you think.

870
00:48:15,356 --> 00:48:18,025
I'm just a copilot.

871
00:48:18,026 --> 00:48:21,695
You see these people
staring at you?

872
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,667
These are the most
powerful people

873
00:48:26,668 --> 00:48:28,302
in New York City

874
00:48:28,303 --> 00:48:30,571
and they keep peeking
over their shoulders

875
00:48:30,572 --> 00:48:32,573
wondering where
you're going tonight.

876
00:48:32,574 --> 00:48:34,041
Where you going, Frank?

877
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:37,745
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

878
00:48:37,746 --> 00:48:40,114
Some place exotic?

879
00:48:42,016 --> 00:48:44,852
Just tell me where you're going.

880
00:48:46,387 --> 00:48:48,756
Los An... Hollywood.

881
00:48:48,757 --> 00:48:51,424
Hollywood.

882
00:48:56,197 --> 00:48:58,365
The rest of us...

883
00:48:58,366 --> 00:49:01,234
really are suckers.

884
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,676
So, I got on this red dress
and these high heels, right?

885
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:10,478
And I got a bra,
like, out here, okay?

886
00:49:10,479 --> 00:49:12,546
And I'm chasing
these two Puerto Rican guys

887
00:49:12,547 --> 00:49:13,881
through the park.

888
00:49:13,882 --> 00:49:16,216
They got a suitcase filled
with bank robbery loot.

889
00:49:16,217 --> 00:49:18,051
Okay, I'm screaming out,
"FBI, freeze!"

890
00:49:18,052 --> 00:49:20,888
And I'm reaching for my gun,
but I can't find it in the bra.

891
00:49:20,889 --> 00:49:21,889
It's so damn big

892
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:24,558
I thought I was going
to shoot my tits off.

893
00:49:27,228 --> 00:49:28,762
You know, that's a funny story.

894
00:49:28,763 --> 00:49:30,464
People always laugh
at that story.

895
00:49:30,465 --> 00:49:32,432
Let me ask you a
question, Mr. Amdursky.

896
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:34,468
If you were having so
much fun undercover

897
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:36,236
why did you transfer
to bank fraud?

898
00:49:36,237 --> 00:49:37,237
I didn't transfer.

899
00:49:37,238 --> 00:49:38,839
I was censured and reassigned.

900
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,241
It's like being punished.
I was punished.

901
00:49:41,242 --> 00:49:43,243
I screwed up in the field.

902
00:49:43,244 --> 00:49:44,378
What about you,
Mr. Fox?

903
00:49:44,379 --> 00:49:46,881
Were you... punished for
screwing up in the field?

904
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:49,583
Oh, no, no, no, I've never
worked in the field before.

905
00:49:49,584 --> 00:49:51,251
I audited
background investigations

906
00:49:51,252 --> 00:49:53,420
of Department of Justice
clerical applicants.

907
00:49:53,421 --> 00:49:54,755
Well, that's just great.

908
00:49:54,756 --> 00:49:56,089
I ask for a team

909
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,191
and they drag the
bottom of the Pacific.

910
00:49:58,192 --> 00:50:00,794
You mind if I ask you
a question, Agent Hanratty?

911
00:50:00,795 --> 00:50:02,930
How come you're so serious
all the time?

912
00:50:02,931 --> 00:50:05,265
Does it bother you,
Mr. Amdursky?

913
00:50:05,266 --> 00:50:07,868
Yeah. Yeah,
it does bother me.

914
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:10,337
Does it bother
you, Mr. Fox?

915
00:50:10,338 --> 00:50:11,972
A little, I guess.

916
00:50:11,973 --> 00:50:15,776
Well, would you like to hear me
tell a joke?

917
00:50:15,777 --> 00:50:19,713
Yeah. Yeah, we'd love
to hear a joke from you.

918
00:50:19,714 --> 00:50:22,783
Knock, knock.

919
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:24,651
Who's there?

920
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:29,757
Go fuck yourselves.

921
00:50:41,302 --> 00:50:42,636
MAN:
<i>He cashed three checks.</i>

922
00:50:42,637 --> 00:50:44,137
<i>They all cleared.</i>

923
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:47,340
<i>I was going to deposit</i>
<i>this one today.</i>

924
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:50,577
I don't want any trouble.

925
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:52,813
No trouble.

926
00:50:52,814 --> 00:50:53,981
No trouble at all.

927
00:50:53,982 --> 00:50:55,816
We'll just take this check
and be on our way.

928
00:50:55,817 --> 00:50:56,984
Thank you.

929
00:50:56,985 --> 00:50:58,418
Good.

930
00:50:58,419 --> 00:51:00,854
Because I don't want
my customers harassed.

931
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:05,292
What are you saying,
he's still here?

932
00:51:06,394 --> 00:51:08,395
201.

933
00:51:10,498 --> 00:51:11,531
Thank you.

934
00:51:11,532 --> 00:51:12,833
Corner here.

935
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:14,334
Oh, thanks, son.

936
00:51:16,337 --> 00:51:17,504
Some steps.

937
00:51:17,505 --> 00:51:19,439
Steps.

938
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:23,844
Hey, Mr. Murphy,
how are you?

939
00:51:23,845 --> 00:51:25,012
Is that Frank?

940
00:51:25,013 --> 00:51:26,013
Yeah, it's Frank.

941
00:51:26,014 --> 00:51:27,180
Hey, Frank, how are you?

942
00:51:27,181 --> 00:51:28,348
How's the knee?

943
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:29,750
Come on, I'll
race you right now.

944
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:31,752
Take care.

945
00:51:31,753 --> 00:51:33,386
Okay, Frank.

946
00:51:33,387 --> 00:51:34,554
AMDURSKY:
"Eyeball the back"?

947
00:51:34,555 --> 00:51:36,189
Come on, Carl,
this guy's a pen and ink man.

948
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,190
A goddamn paperhanger.

949
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:38,358
He doesn't even carry a gun.

950
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:39,593
Why can't we go with you, Carl?

951
00:51:39,594 --> 00:51:41,361
You just keep your
eyes open, do your job

952
00:51:41,362 --> 00:51:43,864
and I'll buy you both
a Good Humor bar.

953
00:51:53,207 --> 00:51:54,374
It's all right, ma'am.
FBI.

954
00:51:57,712 --> 00:52:00,714
201... 201, 201.

955
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:02,482
201...

956
00:52:02,483 --> 00:52:04,484
201... 201...

957
00:52:04,485 --> 00:52:07,888
201... 201...

958
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:13,560
FBI!

959
00:52:22,403 --> 00:52:24,138
FBI!

960
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:27,240
Come out of the bathroom!

961
00:52:27,241 --> 00:52:29,609
Step out of the bathroom!

962
00:52:33,314 --> 00:52:34,414
Hands on your head.

963
00:52:34,415 --> 00:52:35,816
Oh, that's the new
IBM Selectric.

964
00:52:35,817 --> 00:52:36,984
Put your hands on your head.

965
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:39,352
Shut up! You can change the
print type in five seconds.

966
00:52:39,353 --> 00:52:40,353
Just pop out the ball.

967
00:52:40,354 --> 00:52:42,355
Put your hands on your head!
Put your hands...!

968
00:52:42,356 --> 00:52:43,991
You know, he's got
over 200 checks here

969
00:52:43,992 --> 00:52:46,193
Hands on your head!
A gallon of India ink, drafting.

970
00:52:46,194 --> 00:52:47,861
Put it down.
Even has little payroll envelopes...

971
00:52:47,862 --> 00:52:49,063
addressed to himself
from Pan Am.

972
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:50,064
Put it down!
Drop it!

973
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:51,131
Relax.

974
00:52:51,132 --> 00:52:52,465
You're late, all right?

975
00:52:52,466 --> 00:52:53,934
My name's Allen, Barry Allen

976
00:52:53,935 --> 00:52:55,569
United States Secret Service.

977
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,905
Your boy just tried
to jump out the window.

978
00:52:57,906 --> 00:52:59,239
My partner has him
in custody downstairs.

979
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,540
I don't know what
you're talking about.

980
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:03,777
You think the FBI
are the only ones on this guy?

981
00:53:03,778 --> 00:53:04,912
I mean, come on.

982
00:53:04,913 --> 00:53:07,081
Come on, he's dabbling
in government checks here.

983
00:53:07,082 --> 00:53:09,149
We've been following
a paper trail on this guy

984
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,684
for months now.

985
00:53:10,685 --> 00:53:12,753
Hey, you mind taking that gun
out of my face?

986
00:53:12,754 --> 00:53:13,887
Please. Really.

987
00:53:13,888 --> 00:53:15,488
I mean, it makes me nervous.

988
00:53:15,489 --> 00:53:17,424
Let me see some credentials.

989
00:53:17,425 --> 00:53:20,660
Yeah, sure.

990
00:53:20,661 --> 00:53:22,162
Take my whole wallet.

991
00:53:23,664 --> 00:53:24,932
You want my gun, too?

992
00:53:24,933 --> 00:53:26,600
Come over here.
Take my gun.

993
00:53:26,601 --> 00:53:28,668
Hey, hey, look,
just do me a favor.

994
00:53:28,669 --> 00:53:30,270
Take a look outside. Look.

995
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:31,271
Look out the window.

996
00:53:31,272 --> 00:53:32,806
My partner's walking
him to the car

997
00:53:32,807 --> 00:53:34,007
as we speak... Look.

998
00:53:36,344 --> 00:53:38,612
Old guy almost
pissed in his pants

999
00:53:38,613 --> 00:53:40,413
when I came through the door.

1000
00:53:40,414 --> 00:53:42,216
He jumped right
through the window

1001
00:53:42,217 --> 00:53:43,550
onto the hood of my car.

1002
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,585
Hey, Murph?

1003
00:53:45,586 --> 00:53:47,387
- Yeah?
- Call the LAPD again.

1004
00:53:47,388 --> 00:53:49,857
I don't want people walking
through my crime scene.

1005
00:53:52,026 --> 00:53:54,527
I didn't expect the
Secret Service on this.

1006
00:53:54,528 --> 00:53:55,695
Don't worry about it.

1007
00:53:56,865 --> 00:53:58,198
Well, what's your name?

1008
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:01,701
Hanratty, Carl Hanratty.

1009
00:54:05,306 --> 00:54:07,941
Mind if I see
some identification?

1010
00:54:07,942 --> 00:54:09,542
Sure.

1011
00:54:09,543 --> 00:54:13,046
You never can be
too careful these days.

1012
00:54:13,047 --> 00:54:14,214
Well, tough luck, Carl.

1013
00:54:14,215 --> 00:54:15,382
Five minutes earlier

1014
00:54:15,383 --> 00:54:17,885
you would've landed yourself
a pretty good collar.

1015
00:54:17,886 --> 00:54:19,086
It's all right.

1016
00:54:19,087 --> 00:54:21,121
Ten seconds later, and
you'd have been shot.

1017
00:54:21,122 --> 00:54:23,490
Mind if I come
downstairs with you?

1018
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:25,793
I-I got to take a
look at this guy.

1019
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:26,794
Sure thing.

1020
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:27,795
Just, uh, do me a favor

1021
00:54:27,796 --> 00:54:28,896
and sit tight for a second

1022
00:54:28,897 --> 00:54:30,397
while I get
this evidence downstairs.

1023
00:54:30,398 --> 00:54:32,565
You know, I don't want
some maid walking through here

1024
00:54:32,566 --> 00:54:33,566
and making the bed.

1025
00:54:33,567 --> 00:54:34,634
LAPD should be here any sec.

1026
00:54:34,635 --> 00:54:35,835
Wait.

1027
00:54:39,908 --> 00:54:42,242
Your wallet.

1028
00:54:42,243 --> 00:54:44,077
You hang onto it for a minute.

1029
00:54:44,078 --> 00:54:46,279
I trust you.

1030
00:54:57,091 --> 00:54:58,258
Oh...

1031
00:55:02,096 --> 00:55:04,597
Yeah...

1032
00:55:04,598 --> 00:55:06,799
Secret Service.

1033
00:55:48,209 --> 00:55:50,443
Hey!

1034
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:52,612
Oh, goddamn it!

1035
00:55:52,613 --> 00:55:55,148
It was stupid.

1036
00:55:55,149 --> 00:55:56,649
I made a stupid mistake.

1037
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:58,651
Forget about it.

1038
00:55:58,652 --> 00:56:01,154
There are hundreds
of unknown subjects out there.

1039
00:56:01,155 --> 00:56:02,522
I-I can get this guy, Sean.

1040
00:56:02,523 --> 00:56:04,824
The worst thing
a paperhanger can do

1041
00:56:04,825 --> 00:56:05,926
is show his face.

1042
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:07,127
I read the report.

1043
00:56:07,128 --> 00:56:09,496
Six feet tall, brown hair,
27 to 30 years of age

1044
00:56:09,497 --> 00:56:10,663
160 pounds.

1045
00:56:10,664 --> 00:56:12,032
This could be almost anybody.

1046
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:14,301
I heard his voice, Sean,
I saw his face.

1047
00:56:14,302 --> 00:56:17,037
There's nothing for him
to hide behind anymore.

1048
00:56:17,038 --> 00:56:19,506
Just be careful.

1049
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:21,174
You got 12 years in.

1050
00:56:21,175 --> 00:56:23,043
Nobody bothers you
down on the first floor.

1051
00:56:23,044 --> 00:56:25,045
You practically
wrote the book on bank fraud.

1052
00:56:25,046 --> 00:56:26,546
That's the kind of thing

1053
00:56:26,547 --> 00:56:28,548
that can make you
section chief someday.

1054
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:32,185
Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.

1055
00:56:32,186 --> 00:56:33,586
What type of position?

1056
00:56:33,587 --> 00:56:38,325
Position of being humiliated.

1057
00:56:46,034 --> 00:56:48,835
Sean, would you like
to hear me tell a joke?

1058
00:56:48,836 --> 00:56:51,771
Yeah, sure.

1059
00:56:51,772 --> 00:56:55,074
Knock, knock!

1060
00:56:56,444 --> 00:57:00,280
FRANK: So, my-my next question
is, when a pilot retires

1061
00:57:00,281 --> 00:57:03,883
uh, Pan Am sends them
a check every single month?

1062
00:57:03,884 --> 00:57:07,754
Uh, yeah, pension program
sends a check and benefits.

1063
00:57:07,755 --> 00:57:09,356
How much is that check for?

1064
00:57:09,357 --> 00:57:10,958
Uh, kid, I'm really
not in the mood

1065
00:57:10,959 --> 00:57:11,959
for this right now.

1066
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,460
This Skywayman's
driving me crazy.

1067
00:57:13,461 --> 00:57:14,861
Who's the Skywayman?

1068
00:57:14,862 --> 00:57:16,863
Ah, some nut that's
flying around the country

1069
00:57:16,864 --> 00:57:18,131
posing as a Pan Am pilot.

1070
00:57:18,132 --> 00:57:22,202
There's a column about
him in the paper today.

1071
00:57:26,807 --> 00:57:29,476
I keep telling them
this is not my problem.

1072
00:57:29,477 --> 00:57:31,511
This guy
doesn't even fly Pan Am.

1073
00:57:31,512 --> 00:57:32,846
Flies everybody else.

1074
00:57:32,847 --> 00:57:35,482
Flies United, TWA,
Continental, Eastern...

1075
00:57:35,483 --> 00:57:37,985
The Skywayman.

1076
00:57:37,986 --> 00:57:40,320
Newspaper loves this clown.

1077
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:43,723
They call him
"the James Bond of the sky."

1078
00:57:46,494 --> 00:57:47,560
Did you say...?

1079
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:49,396
Bond, James Bond.

1080
00:57:58,339 --> 00:58:01,341
BOND: Tell me, Joan,
why does he do it?

1081
00:58:01,342 --> 00:58:02,675
WOMAN:
He likes to win.

1082
00:58:02,676 --> 00:58:03,943
MAN:
Come on, come on.

1083
00:58:03,944 --> 00:58:05,145
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

1084
00:58:05,146 --> 00:58:07,981
Do you want to play it easy
or the hard way?

1085
00:58:07,982 --> 00:58:09,983
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

1086
00:58:09,984 --> 00:58:13,353
Well, Pussy, you do know a lot
more about planes than guns.

1087
00:58:13,354 --> 00:58:15,588
Hello, Pussy.

1088
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:18,858
: Now, you're
sure this is the suit, right?

1089
00:58:18,859 --> 00:58:20,027
Positive.

1090
00:58:20,028 --> 00:58:21,861
It's the exact suit
he wore in the movie.

1091
00:58:21,862 --> 00:58:23,863
Okay. I'll take three.

1092
00:58:23,864 --> 00:58:25,465
Certainly,
Mr. Fleming.

1093
00:58:25,466 --> 00:58:27,834
Now what you need
is one of those

1094
00:58:27,835 --> 00:58:30,870
little foreign sports cars
that he drives.

1095
00:58:58,066 --> 00:58:59,066
Hello.

1096
00:58:59,067 --> 00:59:00,400
Hi.

1097
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,705
Haven't I seen you before?

1098
00:59:07,741 --> 00:59:09,076
Maybe.

1099
00:59:09,077 --> 00:59:10,577
A couple years ago

1100
00:59:10,578 --> 00:59:12,912
I was on the cover
of <i>Seventeen.</i>

1101
00:59:12,913 --> 00:59:14,414
Yeah.

1102
00:59:14,415 --> 00:59:15,915
You're that model, right?

1103
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:17,084
Cheryl.

1104
00:59:17,085 --> 00:59:18,218
Yes.

1105
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:20,420
The guys used to put
your picture

1106
00:59:20,421 --> 00:59:21,888
on their lockers.

1107
00:59:21,889 --> 00:59:26,493
Isn't that your silver car
I saw parked out front?

1108
00:59:26,494 --> 00:59:29,596
Yeah. One of them.

1109
00:59:32,766 --> 00:59:36,436
So, think I could get
an autograph?

1110
00:59:39,607 --> 00:59:41,441
Do you have a pen in your room?

1111
01:00:17,145 --> 01:00:18,478
Shh.

1112
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:24,851
Man like you can
buy anything he wants.

1113
01:00:35,163 --> 01:00:37,997
He buys a deck of cards
at the hotel gift shop.

1114
01:00:41,169 --> 01:00:43,836
Well, you want to
see a card trick?

1115
01:00:45,506 --> 01:00:47,340
How much did these cards cost?

1116
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:51,645
Oh, 55 cents, I think.

1117
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:56,550
And if they sold me

1118
01:00:56,551 --> 01:01:00,187
downstairs
at the hotel gift shop...

1119
01:01:00,188 --> 01:01:02,822
how much would you pay?

1120
01:01:02,823 --> 01:01:05,024
I'm sor...

1121
01:01:05,025 --> 01:01:08,761
I'm sorry, how mu... how much
would I pay for what?

1122
01:01:11,365 --> 01:01:14,867
The entire night.

1123
01:01:14,868 --> 01:01:19,873
How much would you pay me
for the entire night?

1124
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:26,713
Cheryl, I...
I really don't know.

1125
01:01:28,048 --> 01:01:30,883
Don't be scared.

1126
01:01:33,887 --> 01:01:36,956
Make me an offer.

1127
01:01:43,897 --> 01:01:45,965
$300?

1128
01:01:45,966 --> 01:01:47,900
Go fish.

1129
01:01:50,338 --> 01:01:53,906
Uh, $500?

1130
01:01:53,907 --> 01:01:55,775
Go fish.

1131
01:01:56,777 --> 01:01:58,445
$600.

1132
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,249
Go fish.

1133
01:02:04,252 --> 01:02:06,453
$1,000.

1134
01:02:08,422 --> 01:02:09,989
Okay.

1135
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:12,260
$1,000.

1136
01:02:14,094 --> 01:02:16,929
Okay.

1137
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:19,366
I'll be right back.

1138
01:02:19,367 --> 01:02:21,268
Wait a second.
Where are you going?

1139
01:02:21,269 --> 01:02:22,435
I'm going downstairs

1140
01:02:22,436 --> 01:02:23,603
to cash a check.

1141
01:02:23,604 --> 01:02:26,640
You think this hotel is going
to cash a $1,000 check

1142
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:28,842
at 3:00am?

1143
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,613
It's a New York
Savings and Loan check.

1144
01:02:33,614 --> 01:02:34,781
It's like gold.

1145
01:02:34,782 --> 01:02:35,882
They'll cash it.

1146
01:02:35,883 --> 01:02:37,651
Don't you think they might get

1147
01:02:37,652 --> 01:02:38,851
a little suspicious?

1148
01:02:38,852 --> 01:02:39,852
Let me see that.

1149
01:02:39,853 --> 01:02:42,088
It's a cashier's check.

1150
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:44,291
Endorse it over to me.

1151
01:02:44,292 --> 01:02:46,192
No. I couldn't do that.

1152
01:02:46,193 --> 01:02:48,628
See, this check is for $1,400.

1153
01:02:48,629 --> 01:02:51,230
We agreed upon $1,000.

1154
01:02:51,231 --> 01:02:54,701
Why don't I give you back $400

1155
01:02:54,702 --> 01:02:57,804
and you give me that check?

1156
01:02:57,805 --> 01:03:00,673
Even better.

1157
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:34,874
Does this belong to anybody?

1158
01:03:50,524 --> 01:03:52,525
This is Hanratty.
Merry Christmas.

1159
01:03:52,526 --> 01:03:54,026
FRANK:
Hello, Carl.

1160
01:03:54,027 --> 01:03:55,829
Hello.

1161
01:03:58,366 --> 01:04:00,367
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

1162
01:04:00,368 --> 01:04:03,069
I've been trying
to track you down now

1163
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:05,171
for the last couple of hours.

1164
01:04:05,172 --> 01:04:06,406
What do you want?

1165
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:09,208
I wanted to apologize
for what happened

1166
01:04:09,209 --> 01:04:11,378
out in Los Angeles.

1167
01:04:11,379 --> 01:04:12,545
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

1168
01:04:12,546 --> 01:04:14,647
No, no,
you don't apologize to me.

1169
01:04:14,648 --> 01:04:17,283
Do you always work
on Christmas Eve, Carl?

1170
01:04:17,284 --> 01:04:18,885
I volunteered

1171
01:04:18,886 --> 01:04:21,888
so men with families
could go home early.

1172
01:04:21,889 --> 01:04:24,023
Looked like you were wearing
a wedding ring

1173
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:25,091
out in Los Angeles.

1174
01:04:25,092 --> 01:04:26,760
I thought maybe
you had a family.

1175
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:30,229
No. No family.

1176
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:32,231
You want to talk to me...

1177
01:04:32,232 --> 01:04:34,200
let's talk face-to-face.

1178
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:35,635
All right.

1179
01:04:35,636 --> 01:04:39,672
I'm at my suite at the
Stuyvesant Arms, room 3113.

1180
01:04:39,673 --> 01:04:43,843
In the morning, I leave
for Las Vegas for the weekend.

1181
01:04:43,844 --> 01:04:47,914
You think you're going
to get me again?

1182
01:04:47,915 --> 01:04:49,682
You're not going to Vegas.

1183
01:04:49,683 --> 01:04:51,718
You're not
in the Stuyvesant Arms.

1184
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:53,386
You'd love for me

1185
01:04:53,387 --> 01:04:55,789
to send out 20 agents
Christmas Eve

1186
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:58,591
we barge into your hotel,
knock down the door

1187
01:04:58,592 --> 01:05:00,827
so you can make fools
out of us all.

1188
01:05:00,828 --> 01:05:03,262
I'm really sorry
if I made a fool out of you.

1189
01:05:03,263 --> 01:05:04,431
I really am.

1190
01:05:04,432 --> 01:05:05,464
Uh-uh, no.

1191
01:05:05,465 --> 01:05:06,833
No, listen, I really am.

1192
01:05:06,834 --> 01:05:09,201
No, no, you-you do not
feel sorry for me.

1193
01:05:09,202 --> 01:05:11,037
The truth is,
I knew it was you.

1194
01:05:11,038 --> 01:05:14,256
Now maybe I didn't get the cuffs
on you, but I knew.

1195
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:18,277
Ah, people only know
what you tell them, Carl.

1196
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:21,848
Well, then tell me this,
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

1197
01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:25,184
How did you know
I wouldn't look in your wallet?

1198
01:05:25,185 --> 01:05:27,854
The same reason
the Yankees always win.

1199
01:05:27,855 --> 01:05:31,023
Nobody can keep their eyes
off the pinstripes.

1200
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:34,360
The Yankees win
because they have Mickey Mantle.

1201
01:05:34,361 --> 01:05:36,563
No one ever bets
on the uniform.

1202
01:05:37,832 --> 01:05:39,666
You sure about that, Carl?

1203
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:41,935
I'll tell you what I <i>am</i> sure of.

1204
01:05:41,936 --> 01:05:43,870
You're going to get caught.

1205
01:05:43,871 --> 01:05:47,006
One way or another,
it's a mathematical fact.

1206
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,508
It's-It's like Vegas.

1207
01:05:48,509 --> 01:05:51,610
The House always wins.

1208
01:05:55,482 --> 01:05:59,351
Well, Carl, I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

1209
01:05:59,352 --> 01:06:02,321
Ah. You didn't call
just to apologize, did you?

1210
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,858
What do you mean?

1211
01:06:05,859 --> 01:06:08,928
You... you...
you have no one else to call.

1212
01:06:12,032 --> 01:06:13,666
Oh, ho, ho.

1213
01:06:34,421 --> 01:06:36,055
You got that burger up?

1214
01:06:36,056 --> 01:06:37,156
Yep.

1215
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:41,060
Hi.

1216
01:06:41,061 --> 01:06:42,061
Hi!

1217
01:06:42,062 --> 01:06:43,395
How are you?

1218
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,600
More coffee, sir?

1219
01:06:54,975 --> 01:06:56,175
Are you a collector?

1220
01:06:56,176 --> 01:06:57,643
Of what?

1221
01:06:57,644 --> 01:06:59,745
"Captives of the Cosmic
Ray," "The Big Freeze"

1222
01:06:59,746 --> 01:07:01,413
"Land of the
Golden Giants."

1223
01:07:01,414 --> 01:07:02,448
I've got them all.

1224
01:07:02,449 --> 01:07:04,917
What are you talking about?

1225
01:07:04,918 --> 01:07:07,153
Barry Allen.

1226
01:07:08,889 --> 01:07:10,656
The Flash.

1227
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:14,260
Wait, kid, kid, kid.

1228
01:07:16,429 --> 01:07:17,797
You mean like the comic book?

1229
01:07:17,798 --> 01:07:18,831
Yeah, the comic book.

1230
01:07:18,832 --> 01:07:20,066
When he's not The Flash.

1231
01:07:20,067 --> 01:07:21,567
That's his name, Barry Allen.

1232
01:07:21,568 --> 01:07:24,303
Thank you.

1233
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:30,943
Now get this:
He reads comic books.

1234
01:07:30,944 --> 01:07:32,578
Comic books!
Barry Allen is The Flash!

1235
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:33,980
FOX:
Carl, slow down. Slow down.

1236
01:07:33,981 --> 01:07:36,082
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1237
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:38,250
He's a kid.
Our unsub is a kid.

1238
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:40,152
That's why we couldn't match
his prints.

1239
01:07:40,153 --> 01:07:41,887
That's why he doesn't have
a record.

1240
01:07:41,888 --> 01:07:43,388
Now, I want you to contact NYPD

1241
01:07:43,389 --> 01:07:46,092
for every all-points juvenile
runaways in New York City.

1242
01:07:46,093 --> 01:07:47,593
And don't forget the airports.

1243
01:07:47,594 --> 01:07:49,629
He's been kiting checks
all over the country.

1244
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:50,997
But why New York?

1245
01:07:50,998 --> 01:07:51,998
The Yankees!

1246
01:07:51,999 --> 01:07:54,667
He said something
about the Yankees!

1247
01:07:54,668 --> 01:07:57,402
HANRATTY:
So where are we on the list?

1248
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:02,041
FOX:
Number 53, "Abagnahlee."

1249
01:08:04,244 --> 01:08:05,444
HANRATTY:
Good morning, ma'am.

1250
01:08:05,445 --> 01:08:06,746
We're the FBI agents
who called.

1251
01:08:06,747 --> 01:08:08,280
Yes, I've been waiting.

1252
01:08:08,281 --> 01:08:10,182
I hope you're all hungry.

1253
01:08:10,183 --> 01:08:11,984
I put out the Sara Lee.

1254
01:08:14,788 --> 01:08:17,123
My husband Jack is a lawyer.

1255
01:08:17,124 --> 01:08:20,159
What about your first husband,
Mrs. "Abagnahlee"?

1256
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,761
Abagnale

1257
01:08:21,762 --> 01:08:24,063
but I prefer
to be called Barnes.

1258
01:08:25,398 --> 01:08:27,299
"Frank William Abagnale."

1259
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,035
It says here
he was in the service.

1260
01:08:29,036 --> 01:08:31,003
Did... Did you two meet
during the war?

1261
01:08:31,004 --> 01:08:33,806
Yeah, I lived
in a very small village

1262
01:08:33,807 --> 01:08:37,109
in France... Montrichard...
the kind of place

1263
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:39,812
where they never heard
of Sara Lee.

1264
01:08:39,813 --> 01:08:41,480
Help yourselves.

1265
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:43,549
"Nobody doesn't
like Sara Lee."

1266
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:45,785
You filled out
a missing person's report

1267
01:08:45,786 --> 01:08:49,055
for a runaway juvenile by
the name of Frank Abagnale Jr.

1268
01:08:49,056 --> 01:08:50,656
Is Frankie okay?

1269
01:08:50,657 --> 01:08:52,858
You're aware of the fact
that he wrote some checks

1270
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:54,827
on a closed account
at Chase Manhattan Bank?

1271
01:08:54,828 --> 01:08:56,328
Oh, yes.

1272
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:58,931
The police think
he's some type of criminal.

1273
01:08:58,932 --> 01:09:01,633
What he did was a felony,
Mrs. Barnes.

1274
01:09:01,634 --> 01:09:03,435
It was $1,000.

1275
01:09:03,436 --> 01:09:06,672
Half the kids his age
are on dope

1276
01:09:06,673 --> 01:09:09,241
throwing rocks at police

1277
01:09:09,242 --> 01:09:10,843
and they scared me to death

1278
01:09:10,844 --> 01:09:13,112
because my son made
a little mistake.

1279
01:09:13,113 --> 01:09:14,980
Huh. A 17-year-...

1280
01:09:14,981 --> 01:09:19,284
old boy has to eat,
has to have a place to sleep.

1281
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:22,021
We understand, ma'am.

1282
01:09:22,022 --> 01:09:23,689
Would you happen to have
a picture of your son?

1283
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:25,857
Oh, yes.
I have his old yearbook.

1284
01:09:34,718 --> 01:09:36,635
Okay.

1285
01:09:36,636 --> 01:09:38,570
Okay, okay, we, uh...

1286
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:41,607
we need to send out
an all-office teletype.

1287
01:09:41,608 --> 01:09:45,044
Our unsub's name is
Frank Abagnale Jr., age 17.

1288
01:09:45,045 --> 01:09:47,279
Is Frankie okay?
Is he in trouble?

1289
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,914
Ma'am, I'm sorry
to have to tell you:

1290
01:09:48,915 --> 01:09:50,082
Your son is forging checks.

1291
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:51,851
Forging checks? Wait!

1292
01:09:51,852 --> 01:09:53,318
I'm sure we can
take care of that.

1293
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:55,254
I am working part-time
at the church now.

1294
01:09:55,255 --> 01:09:57,757
Just tell me how much he owes
and I'll pay you back.

1295
01:09:57,758 --> 01:10:00,826
So far, it's about
$1.3 million.

1296
01:10:17,377 --> 01:10:19,344
Hi, Melanie, how are you?

1297
01:10:19,345 --> 01:10:20,412
When you're in the house

1298
01:10:20,413 --> 01:10:21,713
please, just use an ashtray.

1299
01:10:21,714 --> 01:10:23,749
Frank, this fondue is so good!

1300
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,484
Great. Here,
take this for me.

1301
01:10:25,485 --> 01:10:27,019
Ooh, good!
I love Moet!

1302
01:10:28,021 --> 01:10:30,022
Hey. How are you?

1303
01:10:35,695 --> 01:10:37,329
James, James, please!

1304
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:39,331
Just stay away from the
hi-fi system, all right?

1305
01:10:39,332 --> 01:10:40,332
It's reel-to-reel.

1306
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:41,867
You can't wind it like that.

1307
01:10:45,205 --> 01:10:47,406
Christ! Terry!

1308
01:10:47,407 --> 01:10:48,740
This is Italian knit!

1309
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:49,741
Watch where you're going!

1310
01:10:49,742 --> 01:10:51,210
It's just a shirt, man!

1311
01:10:51,211 --> 01:10:53,813
Frank! Come quick!

1312
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:57,483
Lance just fell
into the conversation pit!

1313
01:11:02,189 --> 01:11:05,124
Excuse me, you know
where Lance Applebaum is?

1314
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:06,892
Thank you.

1315
01:11:06,893 --> 01:11:09,661
DOCTOR: These bottles need to be
labeled when you pick them up.

1316
01:11:09,662 --> 01:11:11,230
Do you understand
how dangerous this is?

1317
01:11:11,231 --> 01:11:13,065
Do you?

1318
01:11:13,066 --> 01:11:14,900
Don't stand there crying,
just nod your head

1319
01:11:14,901 --> 01:11:16,335
and tell me you
won't do it again.

1320
01:11:16,336 --> 01:11:18,237
Now dry up and
get back to work.

1321
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:22,041
WOMAN:
Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair, Dr. Sherwood Blair.

1322
01:11:22,042 --> 01:11:23,843
Hey, hey...

1323
01:11:23,844 --> 01:11:25,845
you okay?

1324
01:11:25,846 --> 01:11:28,680
: He told me to
pick up the blood, so I did

1325
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:30,883
but he never told me
to label it.

1326
01:11:30,884 --> 01:11:32,885
Hey, it's okay.

1327
01:11:32,886 --> 01:11:35,154
Stop crying.

1328
01:11:35,155 --> 01:11:37,223
What's your name?

1329
01:11:37,224 --> 01:11:38,490
Brenda.

1330
01:11:38,491 --> 01:11:39,959
Brenda.

1331
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,127
Brenda, I wouldn't worry
about it.

1332
01:11:42,128 --> 01:11:43,628
You know, these doctors

1333
01:11:43,629 --> 01:11:46,031
you know,
they don't know everything.

1334
01:11:46,032 --> 01:11:47,566
It's my first week

1335
01:11:47,567 --> 01:11:50,435
and I think they're
going to fire me.

1336
01:11:50,436 --> 01:11:53,906
No, no, nobody's
going to fire you, Brenda.

1337
01:11:53,907 --> 01:11:56,308
I bet you're good at your job.

1338
01:11:56,309 --> 01:11:58,377
No, I'm not.

1339
01:11:58,378 --> 01:12:00,279
Yeah, I bet

1340
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,348
if I asked you
to check on the status

1341
01:12:02,349 --> 01:12:03,916
of my friend Lance Applebaum

1342
01:12:03,917 --> 01:12:06,451
that you could do that for me
in a second.

1343
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:09,488
WOMAN:
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery.

1344
01:12:09,489 --> 01:12:11,323
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery.

1345
01:12:11,824 --> 01:12:14,559
Um...

1346
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,562
Mr. Applebaum
fractured his ankle.

1347
01:12:17,563 --> 01:12:21,000
Dr. Ashland is treating him
in exam room seven.

1348
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:24,869
You see that? No problem.

1349
01:12:26,273 --> 01:12:28,908
This is the emergency chart.

1350
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:30,442
See that blue star there?

1351
01:12:30,443 --> 01:12:33,279
That means that the patient
has been diagnosed.

1352
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,147
And then,
after he's been treated

1353
01:12:35,148 --> 01:12:38,717
we put a red circle here, see?

1354
01:12:38,718 --> 01:12:40,586
How do you like those braces?

1355
01:12:42,322 --> 01:12:44,523
I guess they're all right.

1356
01:12:44,524 --> 01:12:47,726
I got mine off last year.

1357
01:12:47,727 --> 01:12:49,795
Boy, I hated them.
They were bottoms.

1358
01:12:49,796 --> 01:12:51,496
You know, I still got to wear

1359
01:12:51,497 --> 01:12:53,765
my mouth guard.

1360
01:12:53,766 --> 01:12:56,168
You have really nice teeth.

1361
01:12:57,003 --> 01:12:59,204
Well, thank you.

1362
01:12:59,205 --> 01:13:02,541
And you have a pretty smile.

1363
01:13:02,542 --> 01:13:04,443
WOMAN:
Custodial to cafeteria.

1364
01:13:05,678 --> 01:13:06,878
No, I mean it.

1365
01:13:06,879 --> 01:13:08,948
I really think those
braces look good on you.

1366
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:10,950
Thank you.

1367
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:13,485
You're welcome.

1368
01:13:15,888 --> 01:13:17,323
Brenda.

1369
01:13:17,324 --> 01:13:18,623
Yeah.

1370
01:13:18,624 --> 01:13:21,826
Do you know if they're
hiring here at the hospital?

1371
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:24,696
I'm not sure.

1372
01:13:24,697 --> 01:13:26,332
What do you want to do?

1373
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:30,402
I'm a doctor.

1374
01:13:32,705 --> 01:13:34,439
FRANK:
<i>Dear Dad:</i>

1375
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,809
<i>I've decided to get</i>
<i>off the road for awhile.</i>

1376
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,178
<i>I've taken a night job</i>
<i>at a hospital</i>

1377
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:40,946
<i>and met</i>
<i>some really nice people.</i>

1378
01:13:40,947 --> 01:13:43,149
<i>Feels good to have my feet</i>
<i>on the ground</i>

1379
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:46,819
<i>to wake up in the same bed</i>
<i>every night.</i>

1380
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:51,056
<i>Who knows, maybe I'll even find</i>
<i>someone to settle down with.</i>

1381
01:13:53,493 --> 01:13:55,560
Harvard Medical School...

1382
01:13:55,561 --> 01:13:57,930
top of your class.

1383
01:13:57,931 --> 01:14:01,066
Southern California
Children's Hospital.

1384
01:14:01,067 --> 01:14:04,770
Well, that's a pretty impressive
resume, Dr. Conners

1385
01:14:04,771 --> 01:14:08,040
but unfortunately, uh...
the only thing I need

1386
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:11,476
is a... an emergency room
supervisor

1387
01:14:11,477 --> 01:14:14,446
for my midnight
to 8:00am shift

1388
01:14:14,447 --> 01:14:18,918
someone to baby-sit
six interns and 20 nurses

1389
01:14:18,919 --> 01:14:21,821
but, uh...

1390
01:14:21,822 --> 01:14:25,858
Hell, I doubt that, uh,
you would be interested in that.

1391
01:14:25,859 --> 01:14:27,759
Well, in the past

1392
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,464
they've always let me
choose my own nurses.

1393
01:14:32,465 --> 01:14:35,234
Dr. Connelly?

1394
01:14:35,235 --> 01:14:36,468
Dr. Harris?

1395
01:14:36,469 --> 01:14:37,669
Present.

1396
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:39,404
Dr. Ashland?

1397
01:14:39,405 --> 01:14:41,073
Dr. Conners...

1398
01:14:41,074 --> 01:14:43,408
You gonna take roll every night?

1399
01:14:43,409 --> 01:14:45,311
Uh, yes, I will,
Dr. Ashland

1400
01:14:45,312 --> 01:14:47,412
and if you're going to be late

1401
01:14:47,413 --> 01:14:49,281
I suggest you bring a note.

1402
01:14:52,518 --> 01:14:54,720
Miss Basmann.

1403
01:14:54,721 --> 01:14:56,488
Miss Mace.

1404
01:14:56,489 --> 01:14:58,157
Miss Strong.

1405
01:14:58,158 --> 01:14:59,591
Here.

1406
01:14:59,592 --> 01:15:01,760
Nurse Brown.

1407
01:15:01,761 --> 01:15:03,863
Nurse Sanford?
Here.

1408
01:15:03,864 --> 01:15:06,298
SURGEON : 30 milligrams
of codeine every four hours.

1409
01:15:06,299 --> 01:15:07,799
Run the plasma
at 60 drops a minute

1410
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,336
until we calculate
the fluid requirements.

1411
01:15:10,337 --> 01:15:12,537
What do you estimate
the degree and extent

1412
01:15:12,538 --> 01:15:13,672
of the burns, Kildare?

1413
01:15:13,673 --> 01:15:15,374
DR. KILDARE:
Second and third-degree burns

1414
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:17,076
over about 20 percent
of the body surface.

1415
01:15:17,077 --> 01:15:18,077
Do you concur?

1416
01:15:18,078 --> 01:15:19,078
I concur.

1417
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:21,113
Let's get him up to Pediatrics.

1418
01:15:21,114 --> 01:15:24,649
WOMAN : Nurse Hopp
to the Nurses' Station South.

1419
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:27,452
Nurse Hopp to
the Nurses' Station South.

1420
01:15:27,453 --> 01:15:28,921
Hello, Brenda.

1421
01:15:28,922 --> 01:15:30,256
Hi, Dr. Conners.

1422
01:15:30,257 --> 01:15:32,291
You need to sign these.

1423
01:15:32,292 --> 01:15:34,493
Thank you.

1424
01:15:40,066 --> 01:15:42,401
Do you notice anything
different about me, Doctor?

1425
01:15:42,402 --> 01:15:43,936
You got your braces off!
Yeah!

1426
01:15:43,937 --> 01:15:45,304
Come here.
Let me see.

1427
01:15:45,305 --> 01:15:47,306
I've been trying
to show you all night!

1428
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:50,542
Wow. Good job.

1429
01:15:50,543 --> 01:15:52,111
Yeah?

1430
01:15:52,112 --> 01:15:53,879
So, did it hurt when
they took them off?

1431
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,047
Mine felt so weird after.

1432
01:15:55,048 --> 01:15:57,182
Mm, I keep rubbing
my tongue over them.

1433
01:15:57,183 --> 01:15:59,051
I can't stop.
They're so slippery.

1434
01:15:59,052 --> 01:16:00,552
It feels good, though,
doesn't it?

1435
01:16:00,553 --> 01:16:02,754
Yeah, it feels incredible.

1436
01:16:12,232 --> 01:16:13,765
Oh, my.

1437
01:16:13,766 --> 01:16:16,268
I'm... I'm sorry.

1438
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,949
WOMAN:
Dr. Conners to the ER.

1439
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:31,650
Dr. Conners to the ER.

1440
01:16:31,651 --> 01:16:32,851
Shouldn't you go?

1441
01:16:32,852 --> 01:16:34,686
No. No, no.

1442
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,721
They have a staff doctor
in the emergency ward.

1443
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:38,923
We'll be fine.

1444
01:16:43,163 --> 01:16:46,432
What if he's in surgery?

1445
01:16:46,433 --> 01:16:49,601
Do you really think
I have to go?

1446
01:16:49,602 --> 01:16:52,271
Oh. In here,
Dr. Conners.

1447
01:17:08,554 --> 01:17:12,624
Gentlemen, what, uh...
what seems to be the problem?

1448
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:13,993
Bicycle accident.

1449
01:17:13,994 --> 01:17:18,097
Fractured tibia about
five inches below the patella.

1450
01:17:18,098 --> 01:17:20,299
Hmm.

1451
01:17:22,602 --> 01:17:24,736
Dr. Harris.
Yes?

1452
01:17:24,737 --> 01:17:25,837
Do you concur?

1453
01:17:25,838 --> 01:17:29,274
C... Concur
with what, sir?

1454
01:17:29,275 --> 01:17:31,276
With what Dr. Ashland
just said.

1455
01:17:31,277 --> 01:17:33,945
Do you... Do you concur?

1456
01:17:33,946 --> 01:17:36,281
Uh... well, it was
a bicycle accident.

1457
01:17:36,282 --> 01:17:38,250
Um, the boy told us.

1458
01:17:38,251 --> 01:17:39,851
So you concur?

1459
01:17:39,852 --> 01:17:41,387
Concur? Uh...

1460
01:17:41,388 --> 01:17:43,155
I think we should take an X ray

1461
01:17:43,156 --> 01:17:45,991
then stitch him up and put him
in a walking cast.

1462
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:51,530
That's very good, Dr. Ashland.
Very good.

1463
01:17:51,531 --> 01:17:54,299
Well, you don't seem
to have much need for me.

1464
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,167
Carry on.

1465
01:17:57,837 --> 01:18:00,639
I blew it, didn't I?

1466
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,841
Why didn't I concur?

1467
01:18:02,842 --> 01:18:05,911
WOMAN:
Dr. Henning, call extension 219.

1468
01:18:05,912 --> 01:18:07,513
Dr. Henning, extension 219.

1469
01:18:24,564 --> 01:18:25,897
FRANK SR.:
Make yourself at home!

1470
01:18:25,898 --> 01:18:28,900
Frank Abagnale Sr.

1471
01:18:28,901 --> 01:18:31,370
You're not a cop.

1472
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:35,207
Special Agent Hanratty, FBI.

1473
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:36,241
You're not a cop.

1474
01:18:36,242 --> 01:18:38,743
My landlord said
you were not a cop.

1475
01:18:38,744 --> 01:18:40,379
Well, if you're
going to arrest me

1476
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,047
I'd like to put on
a different suit

1477
01:18:42,048 --> 01:18:43,248
if that's okay with you.

1478
01:18:43,249 --> 01:18:44,916
No, no, I'm not here
to arrest you.

1479
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:46,985
I'm looking for your son.
He's in trouble.

1480
01:18:46,986 --> 01:18:48,620
Do you know where he is?

1481
01:18:51,224 --> 01:18:52,458
If I tell you where he is

1482
01:18:52,459 --> 01:18:54,460
will you promise
not to tell his mother?

1483
01:18:54,461 --> 01:18:56,228
Sure.

1484
01:18:56,229 --> 01:18:59,731
Frank made up a fake I.D.

1485
01:18:59,732 --> 01:19:01,200
and enlisted
in the Marine Corps.

1486
01:19:01,201 --> 01:19:02,667
He's over in Vietnam right now.

1487
01:19:02,668 --> 01:19:04,470
That kid is halfway
around the world

1488
01:19:04,471 --> 01:19:07,072
crawling through
the damn jungle

1489
01:19:07,073 --> 01:19:09,541
fighting the Communists, so...

1490
01:19:11,744 --> 01:19:15,347
please, don't come to my home
and call my boy a criminal

1491
01:19:15,348 --> 01:19:16,748
because that kid
has more guts...

1492
01:19:16,749 --> 01:19:18,683
I never said he was a criminal,
Mr. Abagnale.

1493
01:19:18,684 --> 01:19:20,452
I said he was in trouble.

1494
01:19:20,453 --> 01:19:24,022
If you'd like to give me a call
and talk, here's my number.

1495
01:19:36,236 --> 01:19:38,236
You're not a father, are you?

1496
01:19:40,206 --> 01:19:42,608
Pardon me?

1497
01:19:42,609 --> 01:19:44,075
If you were a father,
you'd know.

1498
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:47,546
I would never give up my son.

1499
01:19:47,547 --> 01:19:51,250
I would never give up my son.

1500
01:19:51,251 --> 01:19:54,686
Yes, sir.
I understand.

1501
01:19:54,687 --> 01:19:56,921
Sean, Sean, now get this:

1502
01:19:56,922 --> 01:19:58,357
"Riverbend Apartments

1503
01:19:58,358 --> 01:20:00,125
"415 Landover

1504
01:20:00,126 --> 01:20:01,893
Atlanta, Georgia."

1505
01:20:01,894 --> 01:20:03,328
Atlanta, Georgia.

1506
01:20:03,329 --> 01:20:05,030
Yeah, I'm on my way
to the airport.

1507
01:20:05,031 --> 01:20:07,098
I'll meet the team in, uh,
in four hours.

1508
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:08,834
Bye-bye.

1509
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:12,437
Come on, it's okay.

1510
01:20:13,973 --> 01:20:15,907
You don't have to cry.

1511
01:20:15,908 --> 01:20:17,176
I'm sorry.

1512
01:20:17,177 --> 01:20:19,044
I'm so sorry, Frank.

1513
01:20:19,045 --> 01:20:20,546
I can't do this.

1514
01:20:20,547 --> 01:20:23,081
Brenda, listen to me.

1515
01:20:23,082 --> 01:20:25,450
I don't care if you're
a virgin, all right?

1516
01:20:25,451 --> 01:20:26,652
Really, I can wait.

1517
01:20:26,653 --> 01:20:29,988
I'm not a virgin.

1518
01:20:33,726 --> 01:20:36,561
I had an abortion
two years ago.

1519
01:20:38,764 --> 01:20:43,168
My parents had a friend do it

1520
01:20:43,169 --> 01:20:47,472
a man that my father
plays golf with.

1521
01:20:47,473 --> 01:20:49,408
And then, when I got better

1522
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:51,776
they kicked me
out of the house.

1523
01:20:51,777 --> 01:20:54,680
I had an abortion and I wasn't
their daughter anymore.

1524
01:20:54,681 --> 01:20:56,181
Hey...

1525
01:20:56,182 --> 01:20:57,182
I'm so sorry.

1526
01:20:57,183 --> 01:20:58,783
Please don't be mad at me.

1527
01:20:58,784 --> 01:21:00,952
Please, please
don't be mad at me.

1528
01:21:00,953 --> 01:21:02,087
No, no.

1529
01:21:02,088 --> 01:21:03,922
Please don't be mad at me.

1530
01:21:03,923 --> 01:21:05,790
Shh. Now... what if...

1531
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:09,094
what if I spoke
to your parents, right?

1532
01:21:09,095 --> 01:21:11,062
May-Maybe I can
straighten things out, huh?

1533
01:21:11,063 --> 01:21:13,064
Well, I ask them all the time

1534
01:21:13,065 --> 01:21:15,767
but they said I still
can't come home.

1535
01:21:15,768 --> 01:21:20,004
And my daddy's...
a lawyer.

1536
01:21:20,005 --> 01:21:22,206
Aw...

1537
01:21:27,246 --> 01:21:30,748
Brenda...

1538
01:21:30,749 --> 01:21:34,219
what if you were engaged
to a doctor?

1539
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:36,221
Will that change anything?

1540
01:21:36,222 --> 01:21:38,055
What?

1541
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:45,163
What if I went
to your parents...

1542
01:21:45,164 --> 01:21:47,499
and I spoke to your father...

1543
01:21:50,769 --> 01:21:54,205
and I asked permission
to marry you?

1544
01:22:07,386 --> 01:22:08,386
It's empty.

1545
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:10,054
Nobody here.

1546
01:22:34,913 --> 01:22:37,315
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?

1547
01:22:37,316 --> 01:22:39,484
Yes, I-I am a Lutheran

1548
01:22:39,485 --> 01:22:42,687
but, please, call me Frank.

1549
01:22:42,688 --> 01:22:45,523
Frank, would you like
to say grace?

1550
01:22:50,129 --> 01:22:53,931
Unless you're not comfortable.

1551
01:22:53,932 --> 01:22:56,133
Absolutely.

1552
01:23:05,545 --> 01:23:09,280
Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.

1553
01:23:11,016 --> 01:23:13,017
The first mouse quickly
gave up and drowned

1554
01:23:13,018 --> 01:23:15,287
but the second mouse,
he struggled so hard

1555
01:23:15,288 --> 01:23:17,922
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter

1556
01:23:17,923 --> 01:23:19,924
and he walked out.

1557
01:23:19,925 --> 01:23:22,927
Amen.

1558
01:23:22,928 --> 01:23:24,128
Amen.

1559
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:27,131
Amen. Oh, that was beautiful.

1560
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:29,801
The mouse, he churned
that cream into butter.

1561
01:23:32,438 --> 01:23:33,438
That's right.

1562
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:34,806
That's pretty good.

1563
01:23:34,807 --> 01:23:36,541
Thank you.

1564
01:23:36,542 --> 01:23:38,310
Frank, have you decided
which hospital

1565
01:23:38,311 --> 01:23:40,178
you want to work at
here in New Orleans?

1566
01:23:40,179 --> 01:23:42,380
Well, um, to be quite honest

1567
01:23:42,381 --> 01:23:45,650
I'm thinking about
getting back into law.

1568
01:23:45,651 --> 01:23:47,452
Oh, my!

1569
01:23:47,453 --> 01:23:49,688
Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

1570
01:23:49,689 --> 01:23:51,789
Before I went to medical school

1571
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:53,925
I passed the bar in California.

1572
01:23:53,926 --> 01:23:55,927
I practiced law for one year

1573
01:23:55,928 --> 01:23:59,364
then I decided why not
try my hand at pediatrics?

1574
01:23:59,365 --> 01:24:02,200
You're just full of surprises.

1575
01:24:02,201 --> 01:24:03,201
Yeah.

1576
01:24:03,202 --> 01:24:05,637
MOTHER:
Oh, my.

1577
01:24:05,638 --> 01:24:06,671
A doctor and a lawyer.

1578
01:24:06,672 --> 01:24:08,673
Well, I'd say that Brenda
hit the jackpot.

1579
01:24:08,674 --> 01:24:11,676
Where did you go to law school?

1580
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:13,411
Uh, Berkeley.

1581
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:15,780
Berkley, Berkley.
Oh, my gosh.

1582
01:24:15,781 --> 01:24:17,382
Isn't that where
you went, Daddy?

1583
01:24:17,383 --> 01:24:19,351
Maybe Frank could
come work for you, Roger.

1584
01:24:19,352 --> 01:24:21,119
You're always saying
how hard it is

1585
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,687
to find Assistant Prosecutors.

1586
01:24:22,688 --> 01:24:24,922
Could he, Daddy?
Could he, please?

1587
01:24:24,923 --> 01:24:26,424
Could he come
work with you, please?

1588
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:28,526
Was that snake Hollingsworth
still teaching there

1589
01:24:28,527 --> 01:24:29,794
when you went through Berkley?

1590
01:24:31,497 --> 01:24:33,030
Hollingsworth.

1591
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:36,167
Yes. Grumpy old
Hollingsworth, right?

1592
01:24:36,168 --> 01:24:37,769
I tell you.
Meaner than ever.

1593
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:39,971
And that dog of his?

1594
01:24:42,341 --> 01:24:46,778
Tell me, Frank, what was
the name of his little dog?

1595
01:24:55,087 --> 01:24:58,590
I'm sorry. Uh...

1596
01:24:58,591 --> 01:25:00,592
The dog was dead.

1597
01:25:02,127 --> 01:25:05,697
How unfortunate.

1598
01:25:05,698 --> 01:25:07,899
Yeah.

1599
01:25:37,996 --> 01:25:40,999
A doctor, a lawyer,
a Lutheran...

1600
01:25:43,502 --> 01:25:46,538
So what are you, Frank?

1601
01:25:46,539 --> 01:25:48,340
'Cause I think
you're about to ask

1602
01:25:48,341 --> 01:25:50,174
for my daughter's hand
in marriage

1603
01:25:50,175 --> 01:25:51,710
and I have a right to know.

1604
01:25:51,711 --> 01:25:54,045
Know what, sir?

1605
01:25:54,046 --> 01:25:56,815
The truth.

1606
01:25:56,816 --> 01:26:01,252
Tell me the truth, Frank.

1607
01:26:01,253 --> 01:26:05,056
What are you doing here?

1608
01:26:05,057 --> 01:26:08,259
What is a man like you
doing with Brenda?

1609
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:10,395
If you want my blessing

1610
01:26:10,396 --> 01:26:12,564
if you want my daughter

1611
01:26:12,565 --> 01:26:15,733
I'd like to hear
it from you now.

1612
01:26:18,404 --> 01:26:20,605
The truth is, sir, that...

1613
01:26:24,042 --> 01:26:25,777
The truth is that...

1614
01:26:27,847 --> 01:26:31,515
I'm not a doctor,
I'm not a lawyer...

1615
01:26:33,619 --> 01:26:36,388
I'm not an airline pilot.

1616
01:26:36,389 --> 01:26:39,591
I'm... I'm nothing, really.

1617
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:49,300
I'm-I'm-I'm just a kid who's
in love with your daughter.

1618
01:26:52,337 --> 01:26:54,872
No.

1619
01:27:02,548 --> 01:27:04,949
You know what you are?

1620
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:06,951
You're a romantic.

1621
01:27:06,952 --> 01:27:09,987
Men like us are nothing
without the women we love.

1622
01:27:09,988 --> 01:27:13,157
I must confess, I'm guilty
of the same foolish whimsy.

1623
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:15,359
I proposed to Carol
after five dates

1624
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,897
with two nickels in my pockets
and holes in my shoes

1625
01:27:18,898 --> 01:27:21,032
because I knew she was the one.

1626
01:27:21,033 --> 01:27:24,068
So go ahead, Frank.

1627
01:27:26,906 --> 01:27:28,973
Don't be afraid.

1628
01:27:28,974 --> 01:27:32,877
Ask the question
you came here to ask me.

1629
01:27:34,647 --> 01:27:37,181
Sir, uh, uh...

1630
01:27:37,182 --> 01:27:38,750
w-what would I have to do

1631
01:27:38,751 --> 01:27:41,385
to take the bar
here in New Orleans?

1632
01:27:46,024 --> 01:27:49,794
No, the... the other question.

1633
01:27:53,031 --> 01:27:57,001
WOMAN:
Right through that door.

1634
01:27:57,002 --> 01:27:59,871
Good luck, Mr. Conners.

1635
01:27:59,872 --> 01:28:01,873
Thank you.

1636
01:28:08,981 --> 01:28:10,682
Hey, Frank...

1637
01:28:10,683 --> 01:28:12,917
you know what I could
never figure out?

1638
01:28:12,918 --> 01:28:15,687
How did you cheat on the
bar exam in Louisiana?

1639
01:28:15,688 --> 01:28:17,522
Why? What's the difference?

1640
01:28:17,523 --> 01:28:19,891
Someone else took the test
for you, didn't they?

1641
01:28:19,892 --> 01:28:22,660
Carl, I'm going to prison
for a long time.

1642
01:28:22,661 --> 01:28:25,463
Seriously,
what's the difference?

1643
01:28:25,464 --> 01:28:27,765
It's a simple question.

1644
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:30,401
Are you going to eat
that eclair?

1645
01:28:32,738 --> 01:28:36,440
Yeah. I'm saving
it for later.

1646
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:38,275
Well, you want
to split it with me?

1647
01:28:38,276 --> 01:28:41,846
No.

1648
01:28:41,847 --> 01:28:45,516
Give me half that eclair
and I'll tell you.

1649
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:59,430
I'm going to figure it out
sooner or later.

1650
01:29:05,771 --> 01:29:09,340
You'll be working under
Phillip Rigby in corporate law.

1651
01:29:09,341 --> 01:29:12,576
Why don't you settle in,
organize your desk?

1652
01:29:14,613 --> 01:29:16,147
Thank you.

1653
01:29:16,148 --> 01:29:18,983
We're having lunch at 12:30
with the Attorney General

1654
01:29:18,984 --> 01:29:20,985
and Governor McKeithen.

1655
01:29:20,986 --> 01:29:22,319
Himself.

1656
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,655
The Governor.

1657
01:29:23,656 --> 01:29:24,889
Did we spell it right?

1658
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:26,524
You sure did.

1659
01:29:26,525 --> 01:29:28,360
Congratulations.

1660
01:29:28,361 --> 01:29:29,594
Thank you, sir.

1661
01:29:29,595 --> 01:29:30,896
Welcome aboard.

1662
01:29:30,897 --> 01:29:33,098
Now...

1663
01:29:37,303 --> 01:29:39,470
Look at this photograph,
Mr. Stewart.

1664
01:29:39,471 --> 01:29:42,673
It's a photograph
of Prentice York

1665
01:29:42,674 --> 01:29:44,776
where they found him, dead.

1666
01:29:44,777 --> 01:29:48,579
Now, here is an enlargement
of part of that photograph.

1667
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:51,149
This is a photograph
of the defendant's signature

1668
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:52,650
on a canceled check.

1669
01:29:52,651 --> 01:29:55,220
Now, here is an enlargement
of that same signature

1670
01:29:55,221 --> 01:29:56,421
which matches

1671
01:29:56,422 --> 01:29:59,457
the signature on the letters
that he wrote to Mrs. Simon

1672
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:01,259
which discuss the possibility

1673
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,594
of defrauding
the great State of Louisiana.

1674
01:30:03,595 --> 01:30:04,796
Your Honor

1675
01:30:04,797 --> 01:30:06,898
ladies and gentlemen of the jury

1676
01:30:06,899 --> 01:30:08,599
this is irrefutable evidence

1677
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,937
that the defendant is,
in fact, lying.

1678
01:30:16,608 --> 01:30:22,414
Mr. Conners, this is
a preliminary hearing.

1679
01:30:22,415 --> 01:30:26,017
There is no... defendant.

1680
01:30:26,018 --> 01:30:30,655
There is no... jury.

1681
01:30:30,656 --> 01:30:33,658
It's just me.

1682
01:30:33,659 --> 01:30:35,293
Son...

1683
01:30:35,294 --> 01:30:39,697
what in the hell
is wrong with you?!

1684
01:30:39,698 --> 01:30:41,632
Is that Mitch?

1685
01:30:41,633 --> 01:30:43,435
Roger! It's Mitch!

1686
01:30:43,436 --> 01:30:45,070
Oh, my, I lost
all track of time.

1687
01:30:45,071 --> 01:30:48,006
MITCH MILLER : As studio
guests for the sing-along tonight

1688
01:30:48,007 --> 01:30:50,308
we have the children's choir
of St. Monica's Church

1689
01:30:50,309 --> 01:30:52,143
in New York City.

1690
01:30:52,144 --> 01:30:53,945
Won't you join them and the gang

1691
01:30:53,946 --> 01:30:56,214
in a few songs for the Irish?
Everybody!

1692
01:32:25,904 --> 01:32:27,872
Dad.

1693
01:32:32,445 --> 01:32:34,512
What are you doing here?

1694
01:32:34,513 --> 01:32:38,883
I... I-I came to see you.

1695
01:32:41,987 --> 01:32:44,222
What are you doing
dressed like this?

1696
01:32:44,223 --> 01:32:46,124
I took a job.
A government job.

1697
01:32:46,125 --> 01:32:47,592
You see what I'm doing?

1698
01:32:47,593 --> 01:32:49,360
Do you have a good lawyer?

1699
01:32:49,361 --> 01:32:51,862
Well... I sort of am
a lawyer now.

1700
01:32:51,863 --> 01:32:55,700
Look at this letter.
The IRS wants more.

1701
01:32:55,701 --> 01:32:58,203
I had a deal with them:
two penalties.

1702
01:32:58,204 --> 01:33:01,639
They ate the cake,
now they want the crumbs.

1703
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:04,509
I want to sue them.

1704
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:07,479
Now they want the crumbs.

1705
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,614
They... Here, sit down.

1706
01:33:09,615 --> 01:33:12,250
They're trying to scare
me, intimidate me.

1707
01:33:12,251 --> 01:33:14,852
You know what?

1708
01:33:14,853 --> 01:33:18,356
You know what? I'll
make them chase me...

1709
01:33:18,357 --> 01:33:20,925
for the rest of their lives.

1710
01:33:26,765 --> 01:33:30,502
Hey, it's great
to see you, Daddy.

1711
01:33:30,503 --> 01:33:35,105
Listen, sit down, I...
I want to show you something.

1712
01:33:36,675 --> 01:33:39,043
I came here to give you this.

1713
01:33:39,044 --> 01:33:43,481
It's an invitation
to an engagement party.

1714
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:47,252
Daddy, I'm getting married.

1715
01:33:47,253 --> 01:33:50,221
Can you believe that?
I'm getting married.

1716
01:33:50,222 --> 01:33:52,823
You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad.

1717
01:33:52,824 --> 01:33:55,059
Listen, I'm getting
a brand-new Cadillac.

1718
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:56,894
I'm getting a $60,000 house.

1719
01:33:56,895 --> 01:33:58,896
I'm-I'm getting it all back.

1720
01:33:58,897 --> 01:34:01,399
All-All the jewelry,
all the furs, everything, Dad.

1721
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:04,169
Everything they took from us,
I'm going to get it back.

1722
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:06,070
Now...

1723
01:34:06,071 --> 01:34:09,840
has Ma seen you
dressed like this?

1724
01:34:09,841 --> 01:34:13,344
Yeah, she came to
pick up some boxes.

1725
01:34:13,345 --> 01:34:15,046
That's okay, that's okay,
you know why?

1726
01:34:15,047 --> 01:34:17,182
'Cause she... she's going
to the wedding with us.

1727
01:34:17,183 --> 01:34:19,050
I'm going to get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.

1728
01:34:19,051 --> 01:34:20,485
I'm getting you
a brand-new suit.

1729
01:34:20,486 --> 01:34:21,719
One of those Manhattan Eagle

1730
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,087
three-button
black pearl suits.

1731
01:34:23,088 --> 01:34:24,155
You'll look great.

1732
01:34:24,156 --> 01:34:25,623
Those are nice. Yeah.

1733
01:34:25,624 --> 01:34:28,426
She won't see me.

1734
01:34:29,261 --> 01:34:31,162
Well, have you tried
to call her?

1735
01:34:31,163 --> 01:34:33,331
Uh-uh.

1736
01:34:33,332 --> 01:34:35,900
Why don't... why don't you
call her right now?

1737
01:34:35,901 --> 01:34:38,403
Dad, why don't you
call her right now? Here.

1738
01:34:38,404 --> 01:34:40,638
Dad, just call her.
Call her for me.

1739
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:42,373
You call her, and you tell her

1740
01:34:42,374 --> 01:34:45,142
I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...

1741
01:34:45,143 --> 01:34:47,778
Your mother's married now,
to my friend Jack Barnes.

1742
01:34:47,779 --> 01:34:51,182
They have a house
in Long Island.

1743
01:34:51,183 --> 01:34:54,952
: I had an
FBI agent come see me.

1744
01:34:54,953 --> 01:34:56,821
You got their number, son.

1745
01:34:56,822 --> 01:34:58,956
The guy looked scared.

1746
01:34:58,957 --> 01:35:03,461
The United States government,
champ, running for the hills.

1747
01:35:03,462 --> 01:35:05,963
Pow! To the moon!

1748
01:35:16,942 --> 01:35:20,044
Dad... it's over.

1749
01:35:21,313 --> 01:35:23,314
I'm going to stop now.

1750
01:35:23,315 --> 01:35:25,416
But y-you've...

1751
01:35:25,417 --> 01:35:27,619
They're never going
to catch you, Frank.

1752
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:29,854
Why won't you sit down?
Dad, she wouldn't do that.

1753
01:35:29,855 --> 01:35:31,822
Come on, sit.
Why would she do that to you?

1754
01:35:31,823 --> 01:35:33,491
Come on, sit with me.
Have a drink.

1755
01:35:33,492 --> 01:35:34,859
I'm your father.

1756
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:38,329
Then ask me to stop.

1757
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:40,765
Then ask me to stop.

1758
01:35:43,435 --> 01:35:45,636
You can't stop.

1759
01:35:47,573 --> 01:35:49,407
Where are you going?

1760
01:35:49,408 --> 01:35:51,842
Come on, Frank,
where are you going?

1761
01:35:51,843 --> 01:35:53,278
Where are you going?

1762
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:55,280
Where are you going tonight?

1763
01:35:55,281 --> 01:35:56,481
Someplace exotic?

1764
01:35:56,482 --> 01:35:57,848
Where are you going tonight?

1765
01:35:57,849 --> 01:35:59,216
Tahiti, Hawaii?

1766
01:36:16,835 --> 01:36:19,771
This is Hanratty.

1767
01:36:19,772 --> 01:36:21,839
FRANK:
Hello, Carl.

1768
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,841
Merry Christmas.

1769
01:36:23,842 --> 01:36:26,243
How are you, Dr. Conners?

1770
01:36:26,244 --> 01:36:30,748
Carl, I haven't been Dr. Conners
for months now.

1771
01:36:32,584 --> 01:36:35,820
Well... I'm sitting here
in my office

1772
01:36:35,821 --> 01:36:37,455
on Christmas Eve.

1773
01:36:37,456 --> 01:36:39,089
What do you want?

1774
01:36:43,429 --> 01:36:46,397
Okay.

1775
01:36:50,502 --> 01:36:52,937
I want it to be over.

1776
01:36:55,941 --> 01:36:58,309
Uh... I want it to be over.

1777
01:36:58,310 --> 01:37:00,244
I'm getting married.

1778
01:37:00,245 --> 01:37:02,279
You know, I'm settling down.

1779
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,281
You've stolen
almost $4 million.

1780
01:37:04,282 --> 01:37:06,651
You think we can just
call that a wedding present?

1781
01:37:06,652 --> 01:37:09,687
Nah, this isn't something you
get to walk away from, Frank.

1782
01:37:09,688 --> 01:37:11,189
I want to call a truce.

1783
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:12,356
No truce.

1784
01:37:12,357 --> 01:37:14,325
You will be caught,
you will go to prison.

1785
01:37:14,326 --> 01:37:15,959
Where did you think
this was going?

1786
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:19,363
Please leave me alone, Carl.

1787
01:37:19,364 --> 01:37:20,764
Please?

1788
01:37:20,765 --> 01:37:22,633
I'm getting close, aren't I?

1789
01:37:22,634 --> 01:37:24,802
You're scared because
I'm getting close.

1790
01:37:24,803 --> 01:37:28,038
I know you... you rented
that car in Shreveport

1791
01:37:28,039 --> 01:37:31,041
and you stayed in that hotel
on Lake Charles.

1792
01:37:31,042 --> 01:37:33,077
You want to run, be my guest.

1793
01:37:33,078 --> 01:37:35,446
Your checks don't lie
as well as you do.

1794
01:37:35,447 --> 01:37:38,649
Stop chasing me.

1795
01:37:40,652 --> 01:37:43,354
I can't stop.

1796
01:37:43,355 --> 01:37:45,923
It's my job.

1797
01:37:45,924 --> 01:37:48,426
It's okay, Carl.

1798
01:37:48,427 --> 01:37:52,062
I just thought I'd ask,
you know?

1799
01:37:54,299 --> 01:37:58,402
Hey. Merry Christmas, huh?

1800
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,141
I love my job.

1801
01:38:04,142 --> 01:38:05,809
All right...

1802
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:07,311
let's get every newspaper we can

1803
01:38:07,312 --> 01:38:09,880
every newspaper in Louisiana
for the last two months.

1804
01:38:09,881 --> 01:38:11,181
What are we looking for?

1805
01:38:11,182 --> 01:38:13,551
Engagement announcements,
name of Conners.

1806
01:38:13,552 --> 01:38:15,953
Conners?! Come on,
Carl, the kid would've

1807
01:38:15,954 --> 01:38:17,488
changed his name by now.

1808
01:38:17,489 --> 01:38:20,291
Mm-mm. He can't change it.

1809
01:38:20,292 --> 01:38:22,192
She thinks he's Conners.

1810
01:38:22,193 --> 01:38:24,428
If he loses the name,
he loses the girl.

1811
01:38:36,608 --> 01:38:38,276
Congratulations.
You having a good time?

1812
01:38:46,351 --> 01:38:48,352
Oh.
Hi.

1813
01:38:48,353 --> 01:38:51,255
Oh, me too. Thank you.
I'm going to, uh, the little boys' room.

1814
01:38:51,256 --> 01:38:52,456
Okay.
Okay.

1815
01:38:52,457 --> 01:38:54,191
Hurry back.

1816
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:09,740
Good evening.

1817
01:39:09,741 --> 01:39:11,342
I'm Agent Hanratty
with the FBI.

1818
01:39:11,343 --> 01:39:13,744
We'd like to have
a few quiet words

1819
01:39:13,745 --> 01:39:15,078
with your host, if possible.

1820
01:39:15,079 --> 01:39:17,280
MAN:
I'll get him.

1821
01:39:18,249 --> 01:39:19,684
Right over there, sir.

1822
01:39:19,685 --> 01:39:22,286
Hi, Roger. How are you?
Hi, Vin.

1823
01:39:22,287 --> 01:39:24,655
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Roger Strong.

1824
01:39:24,656 --> 01:39:26,223
Carl Hanratty, FBI.

1825
01:39:26,224 --> 01:39:28,426
This is Agents
Amdursky and Fox.

1826
01:39:28,427 --> 01:39:30,594
Sorry to crash your party, sir.

1827
01:39:30,595 --> 01:39:32,496
Not at all.
What can I do for you?

1828
01:39:32,497 --> 01:39:34,064
If it's not too much trouble

1829
01:39:34,065 --> 01:39:35,966
I'd like to meet the groom.

1830
01:39:35,967 --> 01:39:39,002
Is there a problem?

1831
01:39:39,003 --> 01:39:40,771
Frank! Frank!

1832
01:39:40,772 --> 01:39:41,905
Can you hold all these?

1833
01:39:41,906 --> 01:39:43,507
Yeah. Come here.

1834
01:39:43,508 --> 01:39:45,876
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.

1835
01:39:45,877 --> 01:39:48,145
They're for us, so we can
start a new life... Hey!

1836
01:39:48,146 --> 01:39:49,780
What are you doing?
What's wrong?

1837
01:39:49,781 --> 01:39:51,515
We have to leave.

1838
01:39:51,516 --> 01:39:53,384
What?!

1839
01:39:53,385 --> 01:39:55,386
Brenda, you love me, right?

1840
01:39:55,387 --> 01:39:56,887
Yes.

1841
01:39:56,888 --> 01:39:58,522
I mean, you'd love me
no matter what.

1842
01:39:58,523 --> 01:39:59,523
Yes.

1843
01:39:59,524 --> 01:40:01,158
I mean, you'd love me
whether I was sick

1844
01:40:01,159 --> 01:40:03,461
or whether I was poor or even
if I had a different name.

1845
01:40:03,462 --> 01:40:05,028
Frank, where'd you get
all that money?

1846
01:40:05,029 --> 01:40:06,296
Brenda, listen.
A name, right?

1847
01:40:06,297 --> 01:40:07,631
A name, it doesn't matter.

1848
01:40:07,632 --> 01:40:09,233
My name is Frank
Conners, right?

1849
01:40:09,234 --> 01:40:10,501
Yes.
That's who I am with you.

1850
01:40:10,502 --> 01:40:11,802
But-but we all have secrets.

1851
01:40:11,803 --> 01:40:13,270
You know, sometimes
when I travel

1852
01:40:13,271 --> 01:40:15,573
I use the name Frank Taylor.
That-That's my secret.

1853
01:40:15,574 --> 01:40:17,608
Frank Taylor?!
Yeah, Frank Taylor, you know?

1854
01:40:17,609 --> 01:40:18,843
Frank Black?!
Frank Black.

1855
01:40:18,844 --> 01:40:20,043
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

1856
01:40:20,044 --> 01:40:22,747
Why are you saying all this?

1857
01:40:22,748 --> 01:40:25,516
Brenda... Brenda, I don't
want to lie to you anymore.

1858
01:40:25,517 --> 01:40:27,050
All right?
I'm not a doctor.

1859
01:40:27,051 --> 01:40:28,819
I never went to medical school.

1860
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:31,555
I'm not a lawyer or a Harvard
graduate or a Lutheran.

1861
01:40:31,556 --> 01:40:34,157
Brenda, I ran away from home
a year and a half ago

1862
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:36,026
when I was 16.

1863
01:40:36,027 --> 01:40:38,829
Frank...

1864
01:40:38,830 --> 01:40:41,131
Frank?

1865
01:40:41,132 --> 01:40:43,133
You're not a Lutheran?

1866
01:40:43,134 --> 01:40:45,636
Brenda... you see
all this money?

1867
01:40:45,637 --> 01:40:47,671
You see all this money?
I have more.

1868
01:40:47,672 --> 01:40:50,307
I have plenty more.

1869
01:40:50,308 --> 01:40:51,341
I have enough money

1870
01:40:51,342 --> 01:40:53,277
to last us for the
rest of our lives

1871
01:40:53,278 --> 01:40:54,745
Look.

1872
01:40:54,746 --> 01:40:57,448
Frank, stop teasing me.

1873
01:40:57,449 --> 01:40:58,749
You're Frank Conners.

1874
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:01,819
You're Frank Conners,
and you're 28 years old and...

1875
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:03,186
Brenda...

1876
01:41:03,187 --> 01:41:05,255
Why would you lie to me?

1877
01:41:05,256 --> 01:41:07,458
Brenda, Brenda...
I want to know your name.

1878
01:41:07,459 --> 01:41:09,593
Listen to me, Brenda.
Tell me your name.

1879
01:41:09,594 --> 01:41:10,961
We can live anywhere we want

1880
01:41:10,962 --> 01:41:12,596
but you have to
trust me, Brenda.

1881
01:41:12,597 --> 01:41:13,964
Do you trust me?
Yes.

1882
01:41:13,965 --> 01:41:16,033
Do you... do you love me, Brenda?
Yes.

1883
01:41:16,034 --> 01:41:17,468
You love me?
I love you.

1884
01:41:17,469 --> 01:41:20,037
Excuse me, Mother.

1885
01:41:20,038 --> 01:41:22,440
Honey, this is Mr. Hanratty.
My wife Carol.

1886
01:41:22,441 --> 01:41:24,041
Oh, Mister...?
Hanratty, ma'am.

1887
01:41:24,042 --> 01:41:25,242
Ratty.
Yes.

1888
01:41:25,243 --> 01:41:27,044
Have you seen Frank or Brenda?

1889
01:41:27,045 --> 01:41:29,346
I-I think they
went upstairs.

1890
01:41:34,653 --> 01:41:36,520
Frank...

1891
01:41:38,022 --> 01:41:39,990
Brenda, come here.

1892
01:41:39,991 --> 01:41:42,059
Okay, in two days,
you're going to meet me

1893
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,194
at Miami International
Airport, all right?

1894
01:41:44,195 --> 01:41:46,797
You're going to leave the house
after your parents go to sleep.

1895
01:41:46,798 --> 01:41:48,031
You're going to take a taxicab.

1896
01:41:48,032 --> 01:41:49,800
You give the taxi driver
this money right here

1897
01:41:49,801 --> 01:41:51,669
and you tell him to drive
all through the night.

1898
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:53,571
Brenda, you're going
to leave at 10:00am.

1899
01:41:53,572 --> 01:41:55,405
10:00am, all right?
But...

1900
01:42:14,425 --> 01:42:16,026
Which room, sir?

1901
01:42:16,027 --> 01:42:17,394
In the corner.

1902
01:42:17,395 --> 01:42:18,729
You have to listen to me, all right?
Okay.

1903
01:42:18,730 --> 01:42:20,598
The International Terminal
in Miami, all right? Say it.

1904
01:42:20,599 --> 01:42:22,500
: Okay, the
International Terminal in Miami.

1905
01:42:22,501 --> 01:42:23,667
No matter what...
No matter what...

1906
01:42:23,668 --> 01:42:24,702
You're going to take a taxicab.

1907
01:42:24,703 --> 01:42:25,703
I will take a taxi.

1908
01:42:25,704 --> 01:42:27,337
You're going to be there
at 10:00am.

1909
01:42:27,338 --> 01:42:28,606
I will be there at
10:00am, no matter what.

1910
01:42:28,607 --> 01:42:29,607
In two days.
Two days.

1911
01:42:29,608 --> 01:42:30,608
Two days, Brenda.
Two days.

1912
01:42:30,609 --> 01:42:32,042
In two days, I'll be there

1913
01:42:32,043 --> 01:42:33,977
no matter what,
at 10:00am.

1914
01:42:40,619 --> 01:42:42,185
You're not going
to tell anyone, Brenda.

1915
01:42:42,186 --> 01:42:43,353
You have to promise me, now.

1916
01:42:43,354 --> 01:42:44,722
Frank, please!

1917
01:42:44,723 --> 01:42:47,090
Before you go, please
tell me your name.

1918
01:42:47,091 --> 01:42:49,459
Please, tell me.

1919
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:54,297
Frank William Abagnale Jr.

1920
01:43:41,112 --> 01:43:43,246
WOMAN:
National Airlines

1921
01:43:43,247 --> 01:43:45,983
flight number 27, serving
Fort Myers, Sarasota, Tampa

1922
01:43:45,984 --> 01:43:49,853
and New York Kennedy,
is now available at gate n...

1923
01:43:51,656 --> 01:43:55,993
Skycap, Gate 14.
Skycap, Gate 14.

1924
01:43:55,994 --> 01:43:57,461
Taxi!

1925
01:44:07,806 --> 01:44:10,274
MAN:
Your attention...

1926
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:08,598
Brenda.

1927
01:45:18,042 --> 01:45:20,043
AMDURSKY:
<i>This guy's a no-show.</i>

1928
01:45:20,044 --> 01:45:21,478
<i>He must've got wise to us.</i>

1929
01:45:21,479 --> 01:45:23,046
HANRATTY:
<i>Maybe he was tipped.</i>

1930
01:45:23,047 --> 01:45:24,815
If he's not here today,
he'll be tomorrow.

1931
01:45:24,816 --> 01:45:26,650
We'll get him before
he leaves the country.

1932
01:45:26,651 --> 01:45:28,051
He doesn't have a passport.

1933
01:45:28,052 --> 01:45:30,554
For the last six months, he's
gone to Harvard and Berkeley.

1934
01:45:30,555 --> 01:45:31,989
I'm betting
he can get a passport.

1935
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:33,824
So we have all our men
waiting for him here

1936
01:45:33,825 --> 01:45:34,825
in Miami International.

1937
01:45:34,826 --> 01:45:36,593
He's used it before.
He knows the layout.

1938
01:45:36,594 --> 01:45:38,529
I talked to Miami police;
they've offered us

1939
01:45:38,530 --> 01:45:40,230
50 uniformed cops
in two shifts of 25.

1940
01:45:40,231 --> 01:45:42,399
With our guys, that's almost
100 men in one airport.

1941
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,234
Don't you think we
should spread it around?

1942
01:45:44,235 --> 01:45:45,802
No, no, this is the exit point.

1943
01:45:45,803 --> 01:45:48,104
Well, how do you know
he hasn't rented a car

1944
01:45:48,105 --> 01:45:50,407
and driven to airports
in New York, Atlanta?

1945
01:45:50,408 --> 01:45:51,909
Because I'm not in New York.

1946
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:53,209
I'm not in Atlanta.

1947
01:45:53,210 --> 01:45:55,045
Yes, this is, uh, Frank Roberts

1948
01:45:55,046 --> 01:45:57,213
and I'm letting
all the universities

1949
01:45:57,214 --> 01:46:00,050
in the area know
that Pan Am will be initiating

1950
01:46:00,051 --> 01:46:02,185
a new recruiting program
this year.

1951
01:46:02,186 --> 01:46:05,455
I'll, uh, be stopping
by your campus tomorrow morning.

1952
01:46:05,456 --> 01:46:08,592
Thank you all very much
for coming.

1953
01:46:08,593 --> 01:46:09,793
At the end of the day

1954
01:46:09,794 --> 01:46:12,930
I'll be choosing eight
young ladies to be a part of...

1955
01:46:14,599 --> 01:46:17,400
Pan Am's future stewardess
flight crew program.

1956
01:46:17,401 --> 01:46:20,037
Now, these eight young ladies
will accompany me

1957
01:46:20,038 --> 01:46:23,106
on a two-month public relations
tour through Europe.

1958
01:46:24,442 --> 01:46:27,143
They will discover firsthand
what it takes

1959
01:46:27,144 --> 01:46:29,279
to be a Pan American stewardess.

1960
01:46:31,148 --> 01:46:33,550
HANRATTY:
Give me at least two men...

1961
01:46:33,551 --> 01:46:36,453
Nah, one man
per every two counters.

1962
01:46:36,454 --> 01:46:37,788
All right?

1963
01:46:37,789 --> 01:46:39,289
Amdursky?

1964
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:41,291
Yeah?

1965
01:46:41,292 --> 01:46:43,460
Make sure your uniforms
are covering

1966
01:46:43,461 --> 01:46:45,495
the sidewalk entrances
and exits.

1967
01:46:45,496 --> 01:46:48,966
Hey... let's have, uh, periodic
sweeps of the men's lav.

1968
01:46:48,967 --> 01:46:51,401
You, here.

1969
01:46:51,402 --> 01:46:55,271
What qualifies me
to be a future stewardess?

1970
01:46:55,272 --> 01:46:57,874
Well, I think that
I'm really friendly

1971
01:46:57,875 --> 01:46:59,643
and I can really help out

1972
01:46:59,644 --> 01:47:03,313
and, um, make people
feel welcome on the plane and...

1973
01:47:03,314 --> 01:47:05,882
We'll be traveling
at 6,000 miles per hour

1974
01:47:05,883 --> 01:47:07,584
at an altitude of 300 feet.

1975
01:47:15,093 --> 01:47:16,526
Ilene Anderson.

1976
01:47:23,968 --> 01:47:26,269
Miggy Acker.

1977
01:47:30,474 --> 01:47:33,243
Debra Jo McMillan.

1978
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:41,118
Candy Heston.

1979
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:20,456
Hi.

1980
01:48:40,344 --> 01:48:41,845
You see that blonde out front?

1981
01:48:41,846 --> 01:48:43,013
I should have been a pilot.

1982
01:48:43,014 --> 01:48:44,848
Exactly.

1983
01:48:44,849 --> 01:48:46,316
WOMAN:
Mr. Carl Hanratty

1984
01:48:46,317 --> 01:48:47,784
please pick up
the courtesy telephone.

1985
01:48:47,785 --> 01:48:49,019
Hanratty.

1986
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:51,188
AMDURSKY: Carl, your
walkie-talkie wasn't working.

1987
01:48:51,189 --> 01:48:52,655
There's a guy
in a Pan Am uniform

1988
01:48:52,656 --> 01:48:55,358
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille
out in front of Terminal J.

1989
01:48:55,359 --> 01:48:56,526
That's the charter terminal.

1990
01:48:56,527 --> 01:48:57,828
Can you get a look at his face?

1991
01:48:57,829 --> 01:48:59,029
He's got his pilot's cap on.

1992
01:48:59,030 --> 01:49:00,263
Carl, I think it's him!

1993
01:49:05,469 --> 01:49:06,970
Watch out, watch out,
watch out!

1994
01:49:12,777 --> 01:49:14,277
Out of the car, Frank.

1995
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:16,913
Frank?!

1996
01:49:16,914 --> 01:49:19,049
Step out of the car!

1997
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:21,384
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

1998
01:49:21,385 --> 01:49:23,153
Don't shoot me!
I'm just a driver.

1999
01:49:23,154 --> 01:49:25,255
A man paid me $100
to wear this uniform

2000
01:49:25,256 --> 01:49:26,422
and pick someone up
at the airport.

2001
01:49:26,423 --> 01:49:27,623
Who you picking up?

2002
01:49:28,459 --> 01:49:29,859
Hey!

2003
01:49:53,784 --> 01:49:56,286
HANRATTY: South America,
Australia, Singapore, Egypt.

2004
01:49:56,287 --> 01:49:58,255
The kid's gone
completely out of control.

2005
01:49:58,256 --> 01:49:59,423
Why wasn't I called?

2006
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:00,924
FOX:
Nobody was called, sir.

2007
01:50:00,925 --> 01:50:03,994
The banks didn't know what
was happening till last week.

2008
01:50:03,995 --> 01:50:05,195
That's impossible.

2009
01:50:05,196 --> 01:50:06,964
They didn't call
'cause it's not counterfeiting.

2010
01:50:06,965 --> 01:50:08,598
It's something else.
Well, what is he doing?

2011
01:50:08,599 --> 01:50:09,766
He's making real checks, sir.

2012
01:50:09,767 --> 01:50:10,767
These are so perfect

2013
01:50:10,768 --> 01:50:12,369
the airline didn't know
the difference.

2014
01:50:12,370 --> 01:50:14,171
Last check was cashed
in Madrid a week ago.

2015
01:50:14,172 --> 01:50:15,405
My guess is he's still there.

2016
01:50:15,406 --> 01:50:16,773
We have to leave now, sir.
Today.

2017
01:50:16,774 --> 01:50:18,108
Go where?

2018
01:50:18,109 --> 01:50:19,776
Spain? You want
to go to Spain?

2019
01:50:19,777 --> 01:50:21,211
Well, eventually,
he's got to go back

2020
01:50:21,212 --> 01:50:22,479
to where the checks
were printed.

2021
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,481
I think that's why
he's moving back through Europe.

2022
01:50:24,482 --> 01:50:26,149
Look at the map, sir.
He's making a circle.

2023
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:27,250
He's running out of checks.

2024
01:50:27,251 --> 01:50:28,718
I know it's a...
it's a long shot, sir

2025
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:31,188
but if we track him from Madrid,
sir, we could still catch him.

2026
01:50:31,189 --> 01:50:33,056
I'm sorry, Carl,
if you couldn't catch him here

2027
01:50:33,057 --> 01:50:34,458
you're not going
to catch him there.

2028
01:50:34,459 --> 01:50:36,360
But, sir, we're going
to let him get away.

2029
01:50:36,361 --> 01:50:40,163
No, Carl, you let him get away.

2030
01:51:20,771 --> 01:51:26,510
A perfect one-16th
all the way around.

2031
01:51:26,511 --> 01:51:28,178
Hmm!

2032
01:51:28,179 --> 01:51:31,147
Color separation is flawless.

2033
01:51:33,184 --> 01:51:35,352
There's no bleeding. Hmm.

2034
01:51:35,353 --> 01:51:38,021
Nobody does work like this
in the States.

2035
01:51:38,022 --> 01:51:39,356
Nobody but us.

2036
01:51:39,357 --> 01:51:41,191
HANRATTY:
Where was it printed?

2037
01:51:41,192 --> 01:51:43,527
It was printed on a monster...

2038
01:51:43,528 --> 01:51:44,528
A monster.

2039
01:51:44,529 --> 01:51:46,029
a Heidelberg, an Istra...

2040
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:47,197
Heidelberg.

2041
01:51:47,198 --> 01:51:48,865
a dinosaur, four colors.

2042
01:51:48,866 --> 01:51:50,400
You can smell the weight.

2043
01:51:50,401 --> 01:51:52,035
Two tons, without the ink.

2044
01:51:53,538 --> 01:51:55,605
Where do they do printing
like this?

2045
01:51:55,606 --> 01:51:57,240
Germany, Great Britain...

2046
01:51:57,241 --> 01:51:58,241
France.

2047
01:51:58,242 --> 01:52:01,044
BOTH PRINTERS:
France!

2048
01:52:01,045 --> 01:52:03,246
France. Frank's mother said
the name of a village in France

2049
01:52:03,247 --> 01:52:04,481
where they didn't have Sara Lee.

2050
01:52:04,482 --> 01:52:06,049
The village where
she met Frank's father.

2051
01:52:06,050 --> 01:52:07,551
Oh, yeah,
I don't remember, uh...

2052
01:52:07,552 --> 01:52:09,519
It started with an M.
It was, uh, "Mont" something.

2053
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,520
"Mont." Mr. Fox?

2054
01:52:10,521 --> 01:52:11,521
Uh, yes, yes.

2055
01:52:11,522 --> 01:52:13,290
Question: "You met your husband
during the war?"

2056
01:52:13,291 --> 01:52:15,225
Answer: "Yes, I lived
in a small village in France.

2057
01:52:15,226 --> 01:52:16,560
Yeah, right.

2058
01:52:16,561 --> 01:52:18,895
"The kind of place where
they never heard of Sara Lee."

2059
01:52:18,896 --> 01:52:19,896
Tell me you wrote down

2060
01:52:19,897 --> 01:52:21,264
the name of the
village, Mr. Fox.

2061
01:52:21,265 --> 01:52:24,634
Montrichard.

2062
01:53:20,624 --> 01:53:21,624
Carl?

2063
01:53:21,625 --> 01:53:22,958
Carl!

2064
01:53:24,228 --> 01:53:25,695
Merry Christmas!

2065
01:53:25,696 --> 01:53:28,598
How is it that we're always
talking on Christmas, Carl?

2066
01:53:28,599 --> 01:53:30,467
Every Christmas
I'm talking to you!

2067
01:53:31,668 --> 01:53:33,536
Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.

2068
01:53:33,537 --> 01:53:35,571
Hey, are you hungry?
Do you want some beans, Carl?

2069
01:53:35,572 --> 01:53:37,040
They got the best
French beans here.

2070
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:38,041
Here, give these a try.

2071
01:53:38,042 --> 01:53:40,010
There's two dozen French
police officers outside.

2072
01:53:40,011 --> 01:53:41,677
Carl, I gotta tell you,
they're delicious.

2073
01:53:41,678 --> 01:53:42,812
They wanted to bring you in.

2074
01:53:42,813 --> 01:53:44,047
You want a bite?

2075
01:53:44,048 --> 01:53:45,581
But they needed the help
of an American.

2076
01:53:45,582 --> 01:53:46,816
Are you hungry?
You want a bite?

2077
01:53:46,817 --> 01:53:48,518
But I told them
I wouldn't bring them to you

2078
01:53:48,519 --> 01:53:50,186
unless I could put the cuffs
on you myself.

2079
01:53:50,187 --> 01:53:51,821
Well, you have a gun?
You have a gun?

2080
01:53:51,822 --> 01:53:52,989
No gun?
No.

2081
01:53:52,990 --> 01:53:54,257
No gun.

2082
01:53:55,726 --> 01:53:57,494
And-and you're...
and you're telling me what?

2083
01:53:57,495 --> 01:53:58,928
There's, uh, there's uh...

2084
01:53:58,929 --> 01:54:00,930
there's two dozen
French police officers out there

2085
01:54:00,931 --> 01:54:01,964
right now on Christmas Eve?

2086
01:54:01,965 --> 01:54:03,166
That's what you're telling me?

2087
01:54:03,167 --> 01:54:04,501
Yeah.

2088
01:54:04,502 --> 01:54:05,868
All right, all right.

2089
01:54:05,869 --> 01:54:07,637
Well, there's no windows here.

2090
01:54:07,638 --> 01:54:10,173
I'm going to take a look
out the front door.

2091
01:54:10,174 --> 01:54:11,341
No! No!

2092
01:54:11,342 --> 01:54:13,009
I told them I'd walk out first

2093
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:14,110
and give a signal.

2094
01:54:14,111 --> 01:54:15,578
Here, you can put
these on yourself.

2095
01:54:15,579 --> 01:54:17,180
No, I can't do that!
I can't do that.

2096
01:54:17,181 --> 01:54:18,348
You know why?

2097
01:54:19,517 --> 01:54:21,017
'Cause I think
you're full of shit.

2098
01:54:21,018 --> 01:54:23,520
I don't... I don't think
there's anyone else out there.

2099
01:54:23,521 --> 01:54:25,422
I think... I think
it's just me and you.

2100
01:54:25,423 --> 01:54:26,756
That's right.

2101
01:54:26,757 --> 01:54:28,758
I think it's just me and you,
and you know what?

2102
01:54:28,759 --> 01:54:30,527
You're going to have
to catch me yourself!

2103
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:33,229
I wo... we don't have time
for this.

2104
01:54:33,230 --> 01:54:35,398
Ah, that's good.
That's good.

2105
01:54:35,399 --> 01:54:38,201
Tell me what
you want me to see, huh?

2106
01:54:38,202 --> 01:54:39,269
I wouldn't lie to you.

2107
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:40,803
Look, you're wearing
a wedding ring.

2108
01:54:40,804 --> 01:54:42,372
You're wearing
a wedding ring, Carl!

2109
01:54:42,373 --> 01:54:43,540
You lied to me about that!

2110
01:54:43,541 --> 01:54:44,974
Didn't you lie about that?!

2111
01:54:44,975 --> 01:54:46,709
You asked me if I had a family.

2112
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:48,244
I did, but I don't anymore.

2113
01:54:57,054 --> 01:54:59,021
Yes? No, no, no,
there is no problem.

2114
01:54:59,022 --> 01:55:00,557
We're coming out right now.

2115
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:04,294
Whoa, that was good.
That was good.

2116
01:55:04,295 --> 01:55:06,296
What, did you...
you pay some hotel desk clerk

2117
01:55:06,297 --> 01:55:08,431
to make that call for you,
is that what you did?

2118
01:55:08,432 --> 01:55:09,432
It was Captain Luc.

2119
01:55:09,433 --> 01:55:10,666
I've got one minute
to bring you out.

2120
01:55:10,667 --> 01:55:12,068
Captain Luc? Captain Luc!

2121
01:55:12,069 --> 01:55:13,069
Ooh, Captain Luc.

2122
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:14,370
Well, Carl, I gotta say

2123
01:55:14,371 --> 01:55:16,539
that-that sounds
pretty official to me

2124
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:18,741
but like I said, I...
I think it's just

2125
01:55:18,742 --> 01:55:20,076
me and you here,
it's me and you.

2126
01:55:20,077 --> 01:55:21,578
So you're going to
have to catch me.

2127
01:55:21,579 --> 01:55:22,579
Frank. Frank!

2128
01:55:22,580 --> 01:55:24,481
You have to trust me on this!

2129
01:55:24,482 --> 01:55:27,250
These people
have been embarrassed, Frank.

2130
01:55:27,251 --> 01:55:28,418
They're angry.

2131
01:55:28,419 --> 01:55:30,186
You rob their banks,
you steal their money

2132
01:55:30,187 --> 01:55:31,287
you live in their country.

2133
01:55:31,288 --> 01:55:33,156
I told you this was
what was going to happen

2134
01:55:33,157 --> 01:55:34,957
that there was no other way
for it to end.

2135
01:55:34,958 --> 01:55:37,760
Don't make a mistake!

2136
01:55:37,761 --> 01:55:38,928
That's good.

2137
01:55:38,929 --> 01:55:41,264
That's good, Carl, you know?

2138
01:55:41,265 --> 01:55:42,265
Keep pushing that lie.

2139
01:55:42,266 --> 01:55:43,266
Keep pushing it.

2140
01:55:43,267 --> 01:55:44,934
Keep pushing
till you make it true.

2141
01:55:44,935 --> 01:55:47,537
They're going to kill you!

2142
01:55:47,538 --> 01:55:50,206
You walk out that door,
they're going to kill you.

2143
01:55:55,112 --> 01:55:57,547
Is that the truth?

2144
01:56:00,951 --> 01:56:03,486
Yeah.

2145
01:56:07,124 --> 01:56:09,792
You have any children, Carl?

2146
01:56:09,793 --> 01:56:13,563
I have a four-year-old daughter.

2147
01:56:13,564 --> 01:56:16,332
You swear on your daughter?

2148
01:56:18,135 --> 01:56:20,837
You swear?

2149
01:56:24,808 --> 01:56:28,144
You swear?

2150
01:56:57,841 --> 01:57:00,009
That was really good, Carl.

2151
01:57:09,687 --> 01:57:10,687
I have him in custody.

2152
01:57:10,688 --> 01:57:11,921
I got him.

2153
01:57:11,922 --> 01:57:13,656
I got him!
It's all right!

2154
01:57:15,025 --> 01:57:16,192
It's all right!

2155
01:57:16,193 --> 01:57:17,960
I got him!

2156
01:57:20,864 --> 01:57:23,333
Hey, I want it...
I want it on the record.

2157
01:57:23,334 --> 01:57:26,035
Frank Abagnale surrendered
of his own accord.

2158
01:57:26,036 --> 01:57:28,471
Understood?
Understood?

2159
01:57:28,472 --> 01:57:29,472
Where are you taking him?

2160
01:57:30,474 --> 01:57:31,441
I'm... I'm supposed to go.

2161
01:57:31,442 --> 01:57:33,209
Where are you taking him?

2162
01:57:33,210 --> 01:57:34,544
Let me in the...

2163
01:57:34,545 --> 01:57:35,545
Let me in the car!

2164
01:57:36,647 --> 01:57:38,881
Hey! Let me in the car!

2165
01:57:41,218 --> 01:57:42,452
Don't worry, Frank!

2166
01:57:42,453 --> 01:57:44,554
I'll have you extradited
back to the United States.

2167
01:57:44,555 --> 01:57:45,655
Don't worry.

2168
01:58:06,076 --> 01:58:09,011
Carl...

2169
01:58:09,012 --> 01:58:11,514
Carl, you have to remember

2170
01:58:11,515 --> 01:58:15,251
to let me call my father
when we land.

2171
01:58:15,252 --> 01:58:17,219
I just want to,
I want to talk to him

2172
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:20,456
before he sees me on television
or something like that.

2173
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:31,768
Carl, look.

2174
01:58:31,769 --> 01:58:33,836
That's LaGuardia right there.

2175
01:58:33,837 --> 01:58:35,605
Runway 4-4.

2176
01:58:35,606 --> 01:58:38,274
Frank, your father is dead.

2177
01:58:38,275 --> 01:58:40,276
I'm sorry.

2178
01:58:40,277 --> 01:58:42,278
I didn't want to say anything

2179
01:58:42,279 --> 01:58:43,946
till we got closer to home.

2180
01:58:43,947 --> 01:58:46,616
He-He... He fell
down some steps

2181
01:58:46,617 --> 01:58:50,787
at Grand Central Station
trying to catch a train.

2182
01:58:50,788 --> 01:58:53,122
I didn't want to be
the one to tell you.

2183
01:58:53,123 --> 01:58:56,459
You're lying, right?

2184
01:58:56,460 --> 01:58:58,795
You said I could talk to him.

2185
01:58:58,796 --> 01:58:59,796
Carl, who are you to...

2186
01:58:59,797 --> 01:59:01,698
who are you to say
something like that, huh?

2187
01:59:01,699 --> 01:59:03,366
Who are you
to say something like that?

2188
01:59:03,367 --> 01:59:04,634
You said I could talk to him.

2189
01:59:04,635 --> 01:59:06,636
He fell, and he...
and he broke his neck.

2190
01:59:06,637 --> 01:59:09,138
I'm sorry.

2191
01:59:09,139 --> 01:59:12,008
I'm really sorry.

2192
01:59:23,253 --> 01:59:24,954
Goddamn it!

2193
01:59:24,955 --> 01:59:27,022
Carl, I'm going to be sick!

2194
01:59:27,023 --> 01:59:28,491
It's all right.

2195
01:59:28,492 --> 01:59:29,559
It's all right.
It's okay.

2196
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:30,993
Carl, I got to go
to the bathroom.

2197
01:59:30,994 --> 01:59:31,994
I'm going to be sick.

2198
01:59:31,995 --> 01:59:33,996
Sure.
Let's go in the bathroom.

2199
01:59:40,838 --> 01:59:42,171
Goddamn it!

2200
01:59:59,757 --> 02:00:02,959
Oh, Daddy...

2201
02:00:05,362 --> 02:00:06,896
You'll have take your seat, sir.

2202
02:00:06,897 --> 02:00:08,531
I've told you twice.
We're landing.

2203
02:00:08,532 --> 02:00:09,999
Sorry. Thank you...
All of you.

2204
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,200
Frank! Come on now.

2205
02:00:11,201 --> 02:00:12,835
Frank?
We're landing in six minutes.

2206
02:00:12,836 --> 02:00:14,370
All of you need to be
in your seats

2207
02:00:14,371 --> 02:00:16,739
Frank, open the door!
With your seat belts fastened.

2208
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:18,540
Frank!

2209
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:22,078
You do it.
Yeah.

2210
02:00:51,174 --> 02:00:53,175
Frank! Frank!

2211
02:00:57,514 --> 02:01:00,149
HANRATTY: All right, remain
seated, everyone, please.

2212
02:01:00,150 --> 02:01:01,984
FBI. Stay seated.
FBI. Stay seated.

2213
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:11,828
Please remain seated!
Stay seated.

2214
02:01:11,829 --> 02:01:13,128
STEWARDESS:
You must stay seated

2215
02:01:13,129 --> 02:01:15,731
until the aircraft
has come to a complete stop.

2216
02:01:15,732 --> 02:01:17,299
HANRATTY:
God almighty.

2217
02:02:06,249 --> 02:02:08,250
What's your name?

2218
02:02:11,421 --> 02:02:14,991
Where's your mommy?

2219
02:02:55,398 --> 02:02:57,133
Hands behind your head!

2220
02:02:59,136 --> 02:03:00,636
Carl, get me in the car,
please.

2221
02:03:00,637 --> 02:03:03,840
Get me in the car.

2222
02:03:03,841 --> 02:03:05,842
HANRATTY:
Put him in.

2223
02:03:21,825 --> 02:03:25,427
JUDGE: <i>Taking into account</i>
<i>the gravity of these crimes</i>

2224
02:03:25,428 --> 02:03:29,298
<i>your history of bold</i>
<i>and elusive behavior</i>

2225
02:03:29,299 --> 02:03:31,734
<i>and your complete lack</i>

02:03:31,735 --> 02:03:34,170
<i>for the laws</i>
<i>of the United States</i>

2227
02:03:34,171 --> 02:03:37,339
<i>I have no choice</i>

2228
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:39,308
<i>to be treated as a minor</i>

2229
02:03:39,309 --> 02:03:41,210

2233
02:04:02,466 --> 02:04:04,316
Use that door over there.

2234
02:04:09,956 --> 02:04:11,957
PRISONER:
...and give everyone my love.

2235
02:04:11,958 --> 02:04:13,859
I think about them
all the time.

2236
02:04:32,179 --> 02:04:35,013
Merry Christmas, Frank.

2237
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:39,785
Hey, I got you
some comic books here.

2238
02:04:46,259 --> 02:04:47,593
How's your daughter?

2239
02:04:47,594 --> 02:04:48,894
What was her name?

2240
02:04:48,895 --> 02:04:49,895
Grace.

2241
02:04:49,896 --> 02:04:51,197
Well... I don't know.

2242
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:53,399
She lives with her mother
in Chicago

2243
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:55,567
and I don't
get to see her much.

2244
02:04:56,903 --> 02:04:58,537
What's in the briefcase?

2245
02:04:58,538 --> 02:05:00,506
Oh. I'm on my way
to the airport.

2246
02:05:00,507 --> 02:05:02,508
It's a paperhanger

2247
02:05:02,509 --> 02:05:04,776
who's working his way
through Minnesota.

2248
02:05:06,179 --> 02:05:09,748
Aw, geez, he's...
he's driving us crazy.

2249
02:05:09,749 --> 02:05:11,350
You got any of the checks?

2250
02:05:11,351 --> 02:05:13,885
Yeah, yeah, I got a...
a counterfeit that he drew

2251
02:05:13,886 --> 02:05:15,754
on the Great Lakes
Savings and Loan.

2252
02:05:15,755 --> 02:05:17,723
See, he's just using
a stencil machine

2253
02:05:17,724 --> 02:05:19,225
and an Underwood.

2254
02:05:19,226 --> 02:05:21,927
Yeah, it's a teller
at the bank.

2255
02:05:21,928 --> 02:05:23,262
Say again?

2256
02:05:23,263 --> 02:05:24,896
I-It's definitely
a teller, Carl.

2257
02:05:24,897 --> 02:05:27,032
I mean, banks, they
always use hand-stamps

2258
02:05:27,033 --> 02:05:28,567
for the dates, see.

2259
02:05:28,568 --> 02:05:30,269
They get used
over and over again

2260
02:05:30,270 --> 02:05:31,737
so they always get worn out

2261
02:05:31,738 --> 02:05:33,639
and the numbers
are always cracking.

2262
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:35,374
The sixes and the nines...

2263
02:05:35,375 --> 02:05:37,576
see, they go first.

2264
02:05:39,379 --> 02:05:41,280
Thanks.

2265
02:05:45,885 --> 02:05:49,087
MAN: <i>I'd like you to take a
look at something for me.</i>

2266
02:05:53,726 --> 02:05:55,994
Tell me what you think.

2267
02:05:58,532 --> 02:06:00,132
That's a fake.

2268
02:06:00,133 --> 02:06:01,700
How do you know?

2269
02:06:01,701 --> 02:06:02,901
You haven't looked at it.

2270
02:06:02,902 --> 02:06:05,471
Well, there's
no perforated edge, right?

2271
02:06:05,472 --> 02:06:08,507
I mean, this... this check
was hand-cut, not fed.

2272
02:06:08,508 --> 02:06:10,742
Yeah...

2273
02:06:10,743 --> 02:06:12,044
Paper is double-bonded

2274
02:06:12,045 --> 02:06:14,413
much too heavy
to be a bank check.

2275
02:06:14,414 --> 02:06:18,417
Magnetic ink, it's, uh,
raised against my fingers

2276
02:06:18,418 --> 02:06:19,751
instead of flat.

2277
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:22,454
And this doesn't
smell like MICR.

2278
02:06:22,455 --> 02:06:23,522
It's some kind of a...

2279
02:06:23,523 --> 02:06:25,291
you know, some kind
of a drafting ink.

2280
02:06:25,292 --> 02:06:27,626
You know, the kind you get
at a stationery store.

2281
02:06:33,567 --> 02:06:35,434
Frank...

2282
02:06:35,435 --> 02:06:37,369
would you be interested
in working

2283
02:06:37,370 --> 02:06:39,505
with the FBI's
Financial Crimes Unit?

2284
02:06:41,508 --> 02:06:42,541
I already got a job here.

2285
02:06:42,542 --> 02:06:44,175
You know, I, uh,
deliver the mail.

2286
02:06:46,112 --> 02:06:50,882
Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.

2287
02:06:50,883 --> 02:06:52,585
You'd be placed in
the custody of the FBI

2288
02:06:52,586 --> 02:06:54,753
where you'd serve out the
remainder of your sentence

2289
02:06:54,754 --> 02:06:56,688
as an employee of
the federal government.

2290
02:06:59,125 --> 02:07:01,427
Under whose custody?

2291
02:07:09,936 --> 02:07:12,638
Hi. I-I'm Frank Abagnale.

2292
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:15,140
I'm supposed to start work
here today.

2293
02:07:15,141 --> 02:07:17,776
It's a tour company
operating out of the BVI.

2294
02:07:17,777 --> 02:07:20,011
Sir, Mr. Abagnale
is here.

2295
02:07:20,012 --> 02:07:21,647
I'm going to call you back.

2296
02:07:51,745 --> 02:07:53,746
Hello, Carl.

2297
02:07:53,747 --> 02:07:55,381
Welcome to the FBI.

2298
02:07:55,382 --> 02:07:57,649
I'll show you
where you're working.

2299
02:08:04,824 --> 02:08:08,294
Carl... how long
do I have to work here?

2300
02:08:08,295 --> 02:08:11,029
It's 8:15 in the morning
to 5:00 in the afternoon.

2301
02:08:11,030 --> 02:08:13,031
45 minutes for lunch.

2302
02:08:13,032 --> 02:08:15,033
No, I...

2303
02:08:15,034 --> 02:08:17,469
I mean, how long?

2304
02:08:19,105 --> 02:08:21,273
Every day.

2305
02:08:21,274 --> 02:08:23,675
Every day, Frank,
till we let you go.

2306
02:09:15,328 --> 02:09:17,563
Yeah.

2307
02:09:17,564 --> 02:09:20,566
Hey, Carl.
Hi.

2308
02:09:20,567 --> 02:09:22,901
How you doing?

2309
02:09:22,902 --> 02:09:24,336
It's not a good time, Frank.

2310
02:09:24,337 --> 02:09:26,504
I'm clearing my desk
for the weekend.

2311
02:09:29,308 --> 02:09:32,244
Carl, you mind if I come
to work with you tomorrow?

2312
02:09:32,245 --> 02:09:34,312
Tomorrow is Saturday.

2313
02:09:34,313 --> 02:09:36,448
I'm flying to Chicago
to see my daughter.

2314
02:09:36,449 --> 02:09:38,049
I'll be back to work on Monday.

2315
02:09:38,050 --> 02:09:39,217
You're going to see Grace, huh?

2316
02:09:39,218 --> 02:09:40,986
Well, that's the plan.

2317
02:09:44,491 --> 02:09:46,759
So what should
I do till Monday?

2318
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:48,527
I'm sorry, kid, I
can't help you there.

2319
02:09:48,528 --> 02:09:49,795
Excuse me.

2320
02:09:56,369 --> 02:09:58,804
This is Hanratty.

2321
02:09:58,805 --> 02:10:01,006
Oh, yeah, put him on.

2322
02:10:08,815 --> 02:10:10,816
Mr. Sawyer.

2323
02:10:10,817 --> 02:10:12,718
How are you?

2324
02:10:12,719 --> 02:10:14,753
I have a half a dozen
more checks

2325
02:10:14,754 --> 02:10:17,022
on that tour operator
at the BVI.

2326
02:10:49,973 --> 02:10:52,742
WOMAN:
American Airlines 355

2327
02:10:52,743 --> 02:10:55,143
serving Chicago
and San Francisco

2328
02:10:55,144 --> 02:10:56,879
is now open
for passenger check-in.

2329
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:00,182
How'd you do it, Frank?

2330
02:11:00,183 --> 02:11:03,519
How'd you pass the bar
in Louisiana?

2331
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:05,954
What are you doing here?

2332
02:11:05,955 --> 02:11:08,090
Listen...

2333
02:11:08,091 --> 02:11:10,192
I'm sorry I put you
through all this.

2334
02:11:10,193 --> 02:11:13,161
You go back to Europe, you're
gonna die in Perpignan Prison.

2335
02:11:13,162 --> 02:11:14,797
You try to run
here in the States

2336
02:11:14,798 --> 02:11:16,999
we'll send you
back to Atlanta for 50 years.

2337
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:20,369
I know that.

2338
02:11:20,370 --> 02:11:22,905
I spent four years trying
to arrange your release.

2339
02:11:22,906 --> 02:11:24,707
Had to convince my bosses
at the FBI

2340
02:11:24,708 --> 02:11:27,009
and the Attorney General
of the United States

2341
02:11:27,010 --> 02:11:28,010
you wouldn't run.

2342
02:11:28,011 --> 02:11:30,946
Why'd you do it?

2343
02:11:30,947 --> 02:11:32,381
You're just a kid.

2344
02:11:32,382 --> 02:11:34,216
I'm not your kid.

2345
02:11:34,217 --> 02:11:36,652
You said you were
going to Chicago.

2346
02:11:36,653 --> 02:11:38,621
My daughter can't see me
this weekend.

2347
02:11:38,622 --> 02:11:40,623
She's going skiing.

2348
02:11:40,624 --> 02:11:42,257
You said she was
four years old.

2349
02:11:42,258 --> 02:11:43,426
You're lying.

2350
02:11:43,427 --> 02:11:45,027
She was four when I left.

2351
02:11:45,028 --> 02:11:46,462
Now she's 15.

2352
02:11:46,463 --> 02:11:49,665
My wife's been remarried
for 11 years.

2353
02:11:49,666 --> 02:11:51,967
I see Grace
every now and again.

2354
02:11:51,968 --> 02:11:53,969
I don't understand.

2355
02:11:53,970 --> 02:11:55,971
Sure you do.

2356
02:11:55,972 --> 02:11:58,841
Sometimes it's easier
living the lie.

2357
02:12:02,078 --> 02:12:05,080
I'm going to let you
fly tonight, Frank.

2358
02:12:05,081 --> 02:12:07,015
I'm not even going
to try to stop you.

2359
02:12:07,016 --> 02:12:09,384
That's 'cause I know
you'll be back on Monday.

2360
02:12:09,385 --> 02:12:12,755
Yeah? How do you know
I'll come back?

2361
02:12:15,492 --> 02:12:17,760
Look.

2362
02:12:17,761 --> 02:12:19,695
Frank...

2363
02:12:19,696 --> 02:12:22,030
nobody's chasing you.

2364
02:12:22,031 --> 02:12:26,469
WOMAN : American
Airlines flight 131 to Pittsburgh

2365
02:12:26,470 --> 02:12:28,471
is now ready for boarding.

2366
02:12:28,472 --> 02:12:33,441
Passengers with boarding passes,
please proceed to Gate 23A.

2367
02:12:40,416 --> 02:12:42,150
Okay.

2368
02:12:42,151 --> 02:12:44,419
Alice, has he still not called?

2369
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:46,621
No, he hasn't.

2370
02:12:56,432 --> 02:12:59,101
HANRATTY:
<i>Good morning.</i>

2371
02:12:59,102 --> 02:13:01,203
I've, uh, called this
meeting to discuss

2372
02:13:01,204 --> 02:13:03,539
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting

2373
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:06,008
which the unsub is washing
and altering checks

2374
02:13:06,009 --> 02:13:08,010
then passing them
throughout Arizona.

2375
02:13:12,148 --> 02:13:13,782
This unsub is a big dog

2376
02:13:13,783 --> 02:13:15,951
passing checks
as large as five figures.

2377
02:13:19,255 --> 02:13:22,257
Sorry I'm late.

2378
02:13:22,258 --> 02:13:24,459
Sorry.

2379
02:13:27,931 --> 02:13:31,400
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

2380
02:13:31,401 --> 02:13:33,602
Why don't we step out
to the bullpen?

2381
02:13:37,741 --> 02:13:41,710
There's impressions
on every line.

2382
02:13:41,711 --> 02:13:45,680
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

2383
02:13:49,152 --> 02:13:50,652
Mind if I take a look?

2384
02:13:53,924 --> 02:13:57,126
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

2385
02:13:58,762 --> 02:14:01,730
Cost the bank $16,000.

2386
02:14:01,731 --> 02:14:03,732
It's a real check.

2387
02:14:03,733 --> 02:14:05,768
Yeah.

2388
02:14:05,769 --> 02:14:07,002
Yeah. It's been washed.

2389
02:14:07,003 --> 02:14:09,004
The only thing original
is the signature.

2390
02:14:09,005 --> 02:14:10,906
But it's perfect, Carl.
I mean...

2391
02:14:10,907 --> 02:14:13,241
I mean, this isn't
hydrochloride or bleach.

2392
02:14:13,242 --> 02:14:15,578
No.

2393
02:14:15,579 --> 02:14:17,312
Something new.

2394
02:14:17,313 --> 02:14:19,448
Maybe a nail polish remover
where the acetone

2395
02:14:19,449 --> 02:14:21,549
removes the ink that's
not been printed?

2396
02:14:25,455 --> 02:14:28,457
How did you do it, Frank?

2397
02:14:28,458 --> 02:14:31,660
How did you cheat on the
bar exam in Louisiana?

2398
02:14:36,833 --> 02:14:40,069
I didn't cheat.

2399
02:14:40,070 --> 02:14:43,939
I studied for two weeks
and I passed.

2400
02:14:44,808 --> 02:14:47,142
Is that the truth, Frank?

2401
02:14:47,143 --> 02:14:49,411
Is that the truth?

2402
02:14:49,412 --> 02:14:51,981
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.

2403
02:14:51,982 --> 02:14:54,749
He washes off their names
and he puts on his own.

2404
02:14:56,352 --> 02:14:58,687
You're saying
that he's a local?

2405
02:14:58,688 --> 02:14:59,955
Well, if it were me, you know

2406
02:14:59,956 --> 02:15:02,324
I'd call the bank first,
I'd check out the balance...

2407
02:15:02,325 --> 02:15:03,993
Make sure there's
enough money in there

2408
02:15:03,994 --> 02:15:05,227
to make it worth your while.

2409
02:15:05,228 --> 02:15:06,428
Exactly.

2410
02:15:06,429 --> 02:15:08,497
You know, Carl, I think
this guy's pretty smart.

2411
02:15:09,899 --> 02:15:12,434
I guess all we have to
do now is catch him.

2412
02:15:14,104 --> 02:15:16,538
We'll start first
thing in the morning.

2413
02:15:16,539 --> 02:15:19,041
We'll run the name
Eric Anthony Feeders.

2414
02:15:19,042 --> 02:15:20,976
In Nevada, Arizona, California.

2415
02:15:20,977 --> 02:15:23,245
Both names, right?
Chris Frank, too?

2416
02:15:23,246 --> 02:15:25,247
Yeah...
